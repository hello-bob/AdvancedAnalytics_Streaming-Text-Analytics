And\nnone of the famous people involved, or me, would dream of endorsing crypto\ninvestments of any kind.\n\nInstead, the fake stories were all AI-generated scams that appeared on\nFacebook news feeds in a BBC template, and with my byline.\n\nThe fraudsters behind them hope that people will click through to the full\narticle, and from there be tempted to invest in a fake investment scheme being\npromoted on the page.\n\nI was curious as to how these scam posts were getting onto Facebook in the\nfirst place, so I contacted Tony Gee, a senior consultant at cybersecurity\nfirm Penn Test Partners.\n\nTony Gee\n\nTony Gee says that the fraudsters are simply able to change the website links\n\nAfter examining the URL, or web address, of one scam page he said it was most\nlikely a paid-for Facebook advert.\n\nMr Gee said he could tell that because the URL had a unique value that\nFacebook adds to allow it to track outbound clicks.\n\nI put this finding to Facebook's owner Meta, who said: \"We don't allow\nfraudulent activity on our platforms, and have removed the ads brought to our\nattention.\"\n\nBut how are the scammers able to get the fake ads onto Facebook news feeds in\nthe first place? How can they get past Facebook's automated detection systems?\n\nProf Alan Woodward, a computer scientist at the University of Surrey, says the\ncriminals appear to be using tools that very quickly redirect users to another\nweb page.\n\nSo when the advert is first placed with Facebook, the link goes through to a\nharmless page, one that doesn't try to con you out of your cash. But then once\nthis has been approved by Facebook, the fraudsters then put on a redirect that\ninstantly takes people somewhere else - to a web page that very much wants to\nmaliciously dent your bank account.\n\n\"If you control a website then it is relatively easy to include a redirect\ncommand, such that before someone's browser has had a chance to show them the\noriginal webpage, their browser is sent to an alternative one,\" says Prof\nWoodward.\n\nHe adds that the fraudsters can quickly and easily keep changing the\ndestination of the redirect. \"As soon as you are able to obfuscate the true\nnature of a URL, that is manna for scammers,\" he says.\n\nThis is a type of online fraud called \"cloaking\", whereby malicious adverts\nare able to get past a social media firm's review stage because the fraudsters\nhave hidden their intensions.\n\nMeta says it is using what it has learnt about this technique to improve its\nautomated detection systems.\n\nRead more stories on artificial intelligence\n\nMargaret (not her real name) is a retiree who lives in Buckinghamshire. She\nwas recently conned out of \u00a3250 when she fell victim to fake advert on\nInstagram, which is also owned by Meta.\n\nShe had been tempted to click on a link to a fictitious ITV article in which\npresenter Robert Peston (or rather, a scammer pretending it was him), chats\nabout an investment opportunity he had come across. Margaret who trusts Mr\nPeston and the ITV brand decided to invest.\n\nIn addition to paying the \u00a3250, Margaret sent off pictures of her passport,\nand both sides of her credit card. She immediately started getting phone\ncalls.\n\n\"It was someone with an American accent welcoming me and saying my money was\nalready making money,\" she tells me.\n\nThe phone calls kept coming, as did a torrent of emails. Margaret became\nsuspicious, particularly when they started asking her about her income and\nsavings, and when she intended to invest more money.\n\n\"I contacted my bank and was refunded but it didn't stop the scammers.\"\n\nMargaret still receives daily calls, and even started getting them from\nsomeone purporting to be from the US National Security Agency promising to\nhelp her investigate the scam.\n\n\"My own mental health is being impacted and I believe I am at risk, in\nparticular identity theft and indeed potential monetary theft,\" she says.\n\"They are so mega persistent, and are dangerous pests.\"\n\nIt is an issue that UK consumer watchdog Which? has been looking into.\n\n\"Malicious advertisers may mask web links or impersonate trusted brands such\nas the BBC to evade online platforms' reporting systems, and people often\ndon't know they're looking at a scam or a deepfake until it's too late,\" says\nRocio Concha, its director of policy and advocacy.\n\n\"It should not fall on consumers to protect themselves from this fraudulent\ncontent online. Ofcom must use its powers under the Online Safety Act [which\nwas passed late last year] to ensure that online platforms are verifying the\nlegitimacy of their advertisers to prevent scammers reaching consumers.\"\n\nOfcom said in a statement that tackling fraud \"is a priority\" for the\nregulator.\n\n\"The UK's new online safety laws will be an important part of making it harder\nfor fraudsters to operate,\" it added. \"Under the new laws, online services\nwill be required to assess the risk of their users being harmed by illegal\ncontent on their platforms - including fraud, take appropriate steps to\nprotect their users, and remove illegal content when they identify it or are\ntold about it.\"\n\nNicolas Corry\n\nNicolas Corry says that social media firms need to put more effort into\nchecking each and every advert\n\nNicolas Corry is managing director at financial investigation firm Skadi. He\nsays he was \"troubled\" by the amount of causal fraud occurring on Facebook and\nother social media sites.\n\n\"These companies are making vast amounts of profits, and exposing people to\nfraud,\" he adds. \"And then it's the finance companies that pay for this, or\nthe victims themselves.\"\n\nMr Corry says social media firms should be more rigorously checking each\nadvert, and its links, before they allow them to go up.\n\nInternational Business\n\nArtificial intelligence\n\nFacebook\n\nInternet fraud\n\nFraud\n\nRelated\n\n## Mining giant BHP proposes buyout of Anglo American\n\n3 hrs ago\n\nAustralia\n\n## US watchdog sues to block $8.5bn handbag takeover\n\n2 days ago\n\nBusiness\n\n## Tesla cuts prices in major markets as sales fall\n\n3 days ago\n\nMore\n\n9 hrs ago\n\n## Meta shares sink after it reveals spending plans\n\nThe firm said expenses would be higher this year as it spends heavily on\nartificial intelligence.\n\n9 hrs ago\n\nTechnology\n\n1 day ago\n\n## Man charged with fraud over \u00a32.67m scheme\n\nLee Maggs appeared at Maidstone Magistrates\u2019 Court on Tuesday.\n\n1 day ago\n\nKent\n\n1 day ago\n\n## AI study gives 'hope' to childhood trauma survivors\n\nThe study finds that trauma changes how a young brain develops and affects\nareas such as empathy.\n\n1 day ago\n\nEssex\n\n2 days ago\n\n## How robots are taking over warehouse work\n\nAt Ocado's newest warehouse robotic arms are helping to pack customer orders.\n\n2 days ago\n\nBusiness\n\n2 days ago\n\n## Watch Ocado robots in action\n\nOcado has added robotic arms to its newest warehouse near Luton.\n\n2 days ago\n\nBusiness\n\nCopyright 2024 BBC.
