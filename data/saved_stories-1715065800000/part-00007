Earlier this week, the California Attorney General\u2019s office\nconfirmed to the San Francisco Chronicle that the law would prohibit\nrestaurants from tacking on any charges besides taxes to diners\u2019 bills \u2014 but\nthe attorney general\u2019s office also said it would release a list of Frequently\nAsked Questions on Wednesday, May 1, which did not happen. Now, sources say\nthey\u2019re hopeful exceptions could be made that would allow for some fees to\nremain in place.\n\nEater SF contacted the attorney general\u2019s press office by phone and email but\nwas not able to get updated information on when business owners can expect the\nFAQs to be released.\n\nThe ban on surcharges would mark a watershed moment for the state\u2019s restaurant\nindustry, which has in recent years relied on mandatory service charges to\nsupplement optional tips and boost staff wages. Under the attorney general\u2019s\ninterpretation of the new legislation, however, all charges besides taxes will\nbecome illegal. The change would effectively require business owners\nthroughout the state to rethink longstanding financial practices in just two\nmonths.\n\nRestaurant and bar owners have been anxiously awaiting industry-specific\nguidance about how the law will be enforced since Gov. Gavin Newsom signed\nSenate Bill 478 into law in October 2023. However, stakeholders from both the\ngovernment and the restaurant industry seem to be unable to agree on how the\nlaw should apply to restaurants and bars. In mid-October, Eater SF reported\nthat the new law seemed likely to impact restaurants, catching industry\nleaders \u2014 and seemingly the authors of the legislation itself \u2014 off guard. A\nspokesperson from the attorney general\u2019s office confirmed to Eater SF that the\nlaw applied to all businesses in the state, including restaurants, but did not\nanswer directly whether or not service fees would be banned.\n\n\"\u201cYou\u2019re basically reverting back ... now you\u2019re hustling for tips.\u201d \"\n\nThe legislation, sponsored by Bay Area lawmakers Sen. Nancy Skinner,\nD-Berkeley, and Sen. Bill Dodd, D-Napa, is intended to protect Californians\nfrom junk fees \u2014 extraneous charges most often associated with hotel, car\nrental, and ticket sale companies. It\u2019s an issue that\u2019s also being taken on by\nthe Biden-Harris administration. Specifically, the California law bans \u201cdrip\npricing,\u201d or \u201cadvertising a price that is less than the actual price that a\nconsumer will have to pay for a good or service.\u201d It doesn\u2019t address\nrestaurants explicitly but states all businesses will be prohibited from\n\u201cadvertising, displaying, or offering a price for a good or service that does\nnot include all mandatory fees or charges\u201d other than government taxes and\nfees and shipping. In October, spokespersons for both Skinner and Dodd told\nEater SF the law was not intended to change restaurant\u2019s ability to charge\ndiners a service fee \u2014 in fact, as of last fall, a spokesperson for Skinner\ntold Eater SF the law would allow restaurants to continue charging service\nfees so long as the fee was disclosed on the menu clearly.\n\nThe possibility of being unable to charge service fees has caused dismay and\nstress among many California restaurant owners. Ryan Cole, one of three owners\nbehind San Francisco\u2019s Hi Neighbor Hospitality Group, operates six restaurants\nin the Bay Area. Three of those restaurants \u2014 Mama in Oakland, and Trestle and\nMichelin Guide-listed 7 Adams in San Francisco \u2013 offer prix fixe menus and\ncharge customers a mandatory 20 percent service fee. At these restaurants,\ncustomers aren\u2019t given the option to leave a tip, as Cole says the ownership\ngroup uses the service fee to not only replace gratuities and pay staff a\nhigher hourly wage but also to help cover the cost of benefits such as two\nweeks of paid vacation and paid sick time. Should the restaurant have to get\nrid of its service fee and replace it with optional tips, Cole says it likely\nwouldn\u2019t be possible to continue paying staff the hourly rates they earn now.\n\u201cAll of that goes away,\u201d Cole says, \u201cbecause you can\u2019t pay that high of an\nhourly rate unless you charge a service charge. You\u2019re basically reverting\nback ... now you\u2019re hustling for tips.\u201d\n\nCole says the group will wait to determine a path forward until they\u2019re\ncertain how the law will be enforced \u2014 but the diminishing number of days left\nbefore it goes into effect finds the company in a tense holding pattern. The\nrestaurant group would likely have to raise prices should a service fee ban go\ninto effect. But Cole worries that if the restaurant group boosted menu prices\nto fold in the cost of the 20 percent charge, the increased price of simply\nwalking in the door would deter some customers from dining out. \u201cYou\u2019re still\ngoing to pay the same amount of money,\u201d Cole says. \u201cBut people are going to\nthink, \u2018Maybe I need to go eat fast food today because I need to save money.\u2019\u201d\n\n\"\u201cI think this was well-intended policy, nobody wants to mislead the consumer.\nBut they didn\u2019t intend this to upend the restaurant industry.\u201d\"\n\nYuka Ioroi co-owns Cassava restaurant in North Beach. The restaurant is known\nfor its deep commitment to achieving pay equity among the front and back of\nthe house and for offering full medical benefits as well as a 401k \u2014 all\nradically progressive achievements the restaurant affords in part by charging\ncustomers a mandatory 20 percent service fee. Similarly to Cole, Ioroi says\nunder a service fee ban she\u2019d have to consider either raising prices to\ninclude the fee or returning to a tip-based pay model for staff, in\nconjunction with a smaller increase in menu prices. Ioroi says she\u2019d take both\noptions to her team for input, but in either case, diners\u2019 potential reactions\nto higher prices are cause for concern. \u201cWe are worried about the sticker\nshock, essentially, to see if that discourages diners,\u201d she says. \u201cOur\nindustry is having a hard time still and this is another thing that adds to\nuncertainty. I feel that it\u2019s initially probably going to affect the industry\nnegatively. We\u2019re very worried.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Laurie Thomas, executive director of San Francisco\u2019s\nrestaurant industry lobby the Golden Gate Restaurant Association, encouraged\nbusiness owners not to make any changes just yet. That\u2019s in part because she\nsays the group is still hopeful legislators could work with the California\nRestaurant Association on a deal to allow restaurants to continue using\nservice fees in some capacity despite the new law. But there\u2019s only a narrow\npath forward for any changes to be made before July; they\u2019d have to be\nexecuted as a part of the state budget, which must be passed by the\nlegislature before June 15 to be signed by the governor no later than the\nstart of the fiscal year, which falls on July 1. But since the legislators\nbehind SB 478 didn\u2019t intend for it to affect restaurant service fees, Thomas\nhopes legislators and the attorney general\u2019s office will find a way to narrow\nits scope or create a carve-out for the industry. It wouldn\u2019t be the only\nexception; SB 478 already includes language to let third-party delivery apps\nlike Uber Eats and Doordash charge fees beyond the listed menu price.\n\n\u201cI think this was well-intended policy, nobody wants to mislead the consumer,\u201d\nThomas says. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t intend this to upend the restaurant industry.\u201d\n\nThomas says the group will provide operational advice for San Francisco\nrestaurant owners once it\u2019s certain how the law will be implemented. If\nthere\u2019s no deal to create a carve-out for restaurants, she expects most\nrestaurants in San Francisco, where it\u2019s common practice to impose a 5 to 7\npercent surcharge to cover employee healthcare, will increase menu prices on\nJuly 1. Considering the overall health of the restaurant industry, Thomas says\nshe\u2019s worried that even such a relatively small boost in menu prices could be\ncatastrophic for some businesses. \u201cIt could put people out of business\nimmediately,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cThat\u2019s the concern.\u201d\n\nThis is a developing story; Eater SF will update it as new information becomes\navailable.\n\n### Sign up for the newsletter Eater SF\n\nSign up for our newsletter.\n\nBest Dishes\n\n### The Best Dishes Eater SF Editors Ate This Week: May 6\n\nSan Francisco Restaurant Openings\n\n### Tiya Brings Modern Prix Fixe Menus to the Bay Area\u2019s Ever-Expanding Indian\nDining Scene\n\nAnatomy Of\n\n### The Anatomy of Jack LaLanne\u2019s Favorite Salad at John\u2019s Grill\n\nChorus\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n\n  * Contact\n  * Send Us a Tip\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * Masthead\n  * About Eater\n  * Ethics Statement\n  * Press Room\n  * Newsletters\n  * How to Pitch\n  * Maps Methodology\n\nVox Media Advertise with us Jobs @ Vox Media \u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
