Violation of Respect and Consideration: The Sass Code of Conduct stresses the importance of being considerate and respectful. It states that decisions should consider how they affect users and colleagues, and that disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. The commit message, especially the phrase \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,\" can be highly contentious and is considered as a call for the elimination of Israel. This phrase has been interpreted in various ways, with some viewing it as a call for Palestinian liberation and others as an incitement to political violence. Its inclusion in a technical project's commit message can be seen as inconsiderate to those who may view it as offensive or harmful, thus not respecting the diverse perspectives within the community.\n  2. Lack of Openness and Inviting Environment: The code encourages openness and an inviting environment, explicitly welcoming individuals regardless of their backgrounds or personal stances. By introducing politically charged statements into a project, it potentially alienates individuals who may have different views, thereby compromising the welcoming nature of the community.\n  3. Escalation of Disagreements: The code also emphasizes resolving disagreements constructively and involving leaders or the community in arbitration if necessary. The use of the site banner for making a political statement can be seen as bypassing community consensus, particularly if there have been many pull requests closed as spam or otherwise mistreated, indicating a possible disagreement on this or related issues within the community.\n  4. Potential Legal Issues: The phrase \"from the river to the sea\" is considered illegal in some European countries. This runs contrary to the guideline of taking responsibility for words and actions and ensuring that these do not harm others or the project itself.\n  5. Inclusivity and Non-Discrimination: The guidelines specifically state the importance of not allowing frustrations to turn into personal attacks and ensuring no one feels uncomfortable or threatened. If the project owner's commit message is perceived as aligning the project with specific political ideologies or movements, this could be seen as discriminating against those who do not share those views, potentially making them feel unwelcome or threatened.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the Code of Conduct applies equally to all\nparticipants in the project, including the project owner and maintainers. As\nthe ones who published and presumably endorsed the Code of Conduct, they are\nexpected to adhere to its principles meticulously. In cases where the conduct\nof high-level project members is questioned, it is crucial for the health and\nintegrity of the project that these concerns are addressed transparently and\nconstructively, following the procedures outlined in the Code of Conduct.These\nviolations by the project owner not only undermine the stated principles of\nthe Sass Code of Conduct but also risk reflecting negatively on the entire\nproject. When the leadership fails to adhere to their own guidelines, it can\nsignificantly damage the project's reputation, making it appear unreliable and\nuntrustworthy. Potential contributors, users, and stakeholders might view the\nproject as a hostile or politically charged environment, which could deter\nparticipation and collaboration. This ultimately jeopardizes the project\u2019s\nsustainability and growth, as a community-driven project thrives on\ninclusivity, respect, and collaborative effort.Mentioned Issues and Pull\nRequests: #1021 #1020 #1000 #999 #998 #997 #995 #994 #992 #991 #990 #989 #988\n#981 #980 #978 #971 #970 #1004 #996 #977  \n---  \nThe text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered:  \n  \nzaerthyn linked a pull request Apr 28, 2024 that will close this issue\n\ndocs: remove alert #1031\n\nOpen\n\nSign up for free to join this conversation on GitHub.
