But as\nrisk-averse institutional investors continue to up their stake in PE, private\nfund managers are expected to provide metrics that characterize the riskiness\nof their portfolios. Yet the lack of observable prices makes traditional\nmeasures of risk (such as standard deviation of periodic investment returns)\nentirely unsuitable.\n\nHow are PE managers responding to this paradox? According to Maria\nNykyforovych, an assistant professor of accounting at Donald G. Costello\nCollege of Business at George Mason University, they are doing what they can\n(within the law, of course) to convert on-paper small losses into break-evens.\nAs Nykyforovych and co-author Gregory W. Brown of UNC-Chapel Hill put it in\ntheir recent working paper to be published in SSRN Electronic Journal, it's a\nstrategy of \"loss avoidance.\"\n\n\"To our knowledge, [this] is the first [paper] to document the management of\nrealized deal multiples, not net asset values of unrealized portfolio\nholdings,\" the authors wrote.\n\nWorking from an extensive data-set comprising deal activity for 1,038 funds\nduring the years 1986-2018, the researchers spotted suggestive patterns in the\nmultiples of invested capital (MOICs) for fully exited buyout deals. Their\nanalysis revealed statistically abnormal concentrations of MOICs in the range\nof 0.95-1.04x (losses of .05 or less can be rounded up to 1.0x), compared to\nMOICs for unrealized deals.\n\nMoreover, they saw that the abnormality was even more pronounced at times when\nPE managers were actively raising capital, so much so that the overall\nlikelihood of a reported break-even MOIC declined by 62% after the next fund\nhad been raised. This strongly implies managers were taking steps to minimize\nlosses in order to reassure risk-averse potential investors. And they were\nentirely rational in doing so. Nykyforovych and Brown found that funds\nreporting a loss ratio of 15% raised, on average, $171 million less than those\nreporting 5%.\n\nNykyforovych emphasizes that the \"loss avoidance\" implicit in her results\ndoesn't imply ethical or legal breaches. It could be a fairly benign matter of\nmutual accommodation between PE executives. \"This is very much a relationship-\nbuilt business,\" she says.\n\n\"It is mostly the same companies doing business together, buying and selling\ncompanies from each other and to each other. Sometimes when the manager really\nneeds that break, that exit, they could approach another manager and say,\n'Hey, I really need to sell this company and it needs to be a break-even.' The\nother manager would agree, and it's 'I owe you one.'\"\n\nStill, she cautions this is all speculation. \"Can you track it? No, at least\nnot with the current data that are available.\"\n\nHowever they're done, these slight adjustments might not be all that\nremarkable, if loss ratios were indeed an accurate measurement of risk. But\nfurther analysis by Nykyforovych and Brown found no reliable association\nbetween loss ratios and the standard deviation of investment multiple for a\ngiven fund.\n\nAnd that's not all\u2014the researchers also found evidence suggesting that funds\nwith more break-even exits delivered lower returns for investors. That could\nbe because PE managers devoted too much time and money to avoiding losses, and\nnot enough to maximizing the performance of more successful portfolio\ncompanies.\n\nNykyforovych believes her study is an object lesson in the possible dangers of\nmetric-based myopia. Investors assign too much weight to loss ratios, and PE\nmanagers make crucial decisions accordingly, to the potential detriment of\noverall fund performance.\n\n\"The implication of that is that maybe the money managers of a pension plan\nare well-meaning, and they choose investments with low loss rates first,\nbecause that's preservation of your retirement...But long-term, if that does\nnot result in additional return every year, you're not better off,\" she says.\n\nNarrowing one's field of vision to a single figure certainly simplifies\nthings, but it can result in distorted incentives for all concerned.\nNykyforovych recommends that both institutional investors and PE managers ask\nthemselves, \"'Is loss ratio actually a good measure to use when we are\nassessing riskiness? It is a useful metric, but maybe not to the extent that\neveryone is currently using it.\"\n\nMore information: Maria Borysoff (Nykyforovych) et al, Loss Avoidance in\nPrivate Equity, SSRN Electronic Journal (2024).
