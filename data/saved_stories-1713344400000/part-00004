When split to\n20% of original thickness kangaroo retains 30 to 60% of the tensile strength\nof the unsplit hide. Calf split to 20% of original thickness, on the other\nhand, retains only 1\u20134% of original strength.^[9]\n\nKangaroo leather is lighter and stronger than the hide of a cow or goat. It\nhas 10 times the tensile strength of cowhide and is 50% stronger than\ngoatskin.^[10]\n\nStudies of the morphology of kangaroo leather help explain its particular\nproperties.\n\nThe collagen fibre bundles in cattle hide are arranged in a complex weaving\npattern. The fibres are often at angles as much as 90 degrees to the skin\nsurface. Cattle hide also contains sweat glands, erector pili muscles and a\ndistinct gradation in elastin levels, concentrated in the upper part of the\nskin. Kangaroo hide on the other hand has been shown to have a highly uniform\norientation of fibre bundles in parallel with the skin surface. It does not\ncontain sweat glands or erector pili muscles, and elastin is evenly\ndistributed throughout the skin thickness.^[11] This structural uniformity\nexplains both the greater tensile strength of the whole leather and the\ngreater retention of strength in splits. Bovine skin is much more complex in\ncross-section; in whole section it has many more weak points from which tears\ncan start when placed under tension. In addition, when split the collagen\nfibres running at significant angles to the skin surface will be cut, becoming\nweak points.\n\n## Environmental aspects[edit]\n\nThe Australian kangaroo industry produces a range of meat and leather products\nfrom animals harvested from the wild under strict government-controlled\nmanagement plans intended to ensure that the harvest is sustainable and\nhumane.^[12] A wide cross section of Australian ecologists support the\nkangaroo industry as being both sustainable and environmentally wise.^[13]\nMany argue that kangaroos, native to Australia, are a more environmentally\nfriendly livestock option than introduced sheep and cattle.^[14] The two most\nimportant facets of kangaroos' better ecological fit than European\nagricultural animals relate to their adaptation to Australia's aridity.\n\nKangaroos have small chest development and so require less water to breathe\nthan placental mammals, which usually must expand a diaphragm, losing more\nmoisture in respiration. Kangaroos just make small pants while immobile, and\nin motion expand and contract their lungs effectively using their leg muscles.\nThe belly flops up, contracting the lungs, and down, expanding them.\n\nThe kangaroo's paws are softer and do not compact the ground as hoofed cattle\nand sheep do. Instead, its hopping leaves very small bowl-shaped depressions\nin the surface of even dry clay soil, which let native grass seeds carried on\nthe wind settle into them. The bowl shape concentrates any moisture that may\nfall into it into a wet point that the grass seed can use to germinate. Thus,\nkangaroos deplete the water table more slowly than cattle or sheep, and would\neven be viable in the absence of any bore water. The ecological arguments for\nkangaroos replacing sheep and cattle as arid land livestock are compelling,\nthough they must be set against objections of kangaroos' lack of domestication\nand breeding rate.^[citation needed] Kangaroos are eaten in most\nstates.^[citation needed]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Australia portal\n  * Companies portal\n\n  * Kangaroo industry\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"Eat kangaroo to 'save the planet'\".
