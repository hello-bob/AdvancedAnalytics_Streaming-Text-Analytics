It uses advanced AI technology to efficiently extract key information from videos, providing users with quick and accurate text outputs.\n\n  * Simply input the URL of a YouTube video into CreatorMagic, select the type of written content you need, and our service will process the video and deliver high-quality written content in minutes.\n\n  * CreatorMagic offers two pricing plans to suit different needs. The Simple Scribe plan is priced at $7 per 100 requests, perfect for basic content generation such as summaries and notes, and includes sentiment analysis. The Pro Publisher plan, at $17 per 100 requests, provides a more advanced AI for capturing nuances in content and supports a wider range of written formats, including detailed blog posts and professional summaries, also including sentiment analysis. Both plans are designed to cater to everyone from casual users to professionals seeking high-quality outputs.\n\n  * While we don't offer a free trial, you can start with the Simple Scribe plan at just $7 for 100 requests. This low-cost entry option allows you to evaluate the quality and usefulness of our service before committing to more or opting for the Pro Publisher plan.\n\n  * CreatorMagic utilizes the latest AI technology tailored for content extraction and creation. The Pro Publisher plan employs advanced algorithms to ensure the content is not only accurate but also rich in detail and context, suitable for professional needs.\n\n  * While CreatorMagic can process videos of various lengths, the maximum video length depends on the plan: The Simple Scribe plan supports videos with up to approximately 142 minutes of spoken content, aligning with its 16K token limit. The Pro Publisher plan can handle up to approximately 18.9 hours of spoken content with its 128K token limit. These limits ensure high-quality, contextually accurate outputs tailored to the length of your video content.\n\n  * No, there are no hidden fees or additional costs. The prices for the Simple Scribe and Pro Publisher plans are inclusive of all features offered within each tier, and you pay only for the sets of 100 requests you purchase.\n\n  * CreatorMagic uses advanced AI technology to analyze the transcript of a video rather than the video itself. By leveraging the transcript, CreatorMagic can efficiently extract key information and generate high-quality written content. This approach ensures that the content produced is accurate, contextually relevant, and tailored to the user's needs. However, it's important to note that this method might miss visual or audio cues present only in the video, which could provide additional context or insights.\n\n  * CreatorMagic's Sentiment Analysis feature leverages viewer comments to craft a comprehensive understanding of the sentiment surrounding a video. By analyzing the comments, CreatorMagic can identify trends, patterns, and emotions expressed by viewers, providing valuable insights for content creators. This feature is particularly useful for crafting targeted content that resonates with your audience and boosting engagement.\n\n## Transform Your Videos into Engaging Content Now\n\nUnleash the power of CreatorMagic to simplify your content creation process\nand gain insights with advanced sentiment analysis today.\n\nStart with CreatorMagic\n\nCreatorMagic\n\nTransform YouTube Videos into Written Content\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 - All rights reserved\n\nLINKS\n\nLoginPricing\n\nLEGAL\n\nTerms of servicePrivacy policy\n\n", "frontpage": false}
