Not too shabby, considering that it's\nmostly the work of just one person, Grzegorz Stycze\u0144 of Slavic Magic, who has\nhopefully found time to sleep now and then between fielding bug reports and\npreparing the game's first patches.\n\nStycze\u0144 understandably doesn't have much time for interviews right now - those\ntroublesome archers aren't going to balance themselves - but yesterday I spoke\nto Tim Bender, CEO of Manor Lords publisher Hooded Horse, about how Stycze\u0144 is\ngetting on. The answer, apparently, is: pretty good, because Stycze\u0144 has a\nhealthy approach to early access development in keeping players close, without\nquite handing them the wheel.\n\nManor Lords VR mod suggests that it would make a terrific god sim\n\nRead more on Rock Paper Shotgun\n\n\"My personal opinion is best kept well away from the game,\" Bender began. \"The\nCEO of the publisher should not be getting involved on how a game works. But,\nyou know, I can tell you that Greg has a great approach to development - even\nbefore early access, [though] it's an approach that is ideal for development\nin EA. It's a very collaborative approach. It's a very community-engaged\napproach. He would take polls on things, ask their opinions on various things,\nget that information, and then take that sort of under consideration. It's not\nlike 'vote on the next feature', it's more like, 'vote to provide information'\nso that he can figure out [the next steps].\n\n\"It's that sort of best use of community engagement, in guiding someone's\nthinking and feed that thinking, so they can search for the way within a\ncoherent vision [of how] to design the game,\" Bender went on. \"And that's been\nGreg's approach before early access. He had the alpha tester group, over 100\npeople helping him work and refine the game. He also would regularly engage\nwith the broader community, ask them questions as well. So it's not a strange\nnew thing for him. It's just the scale has of course gone up hugely, but he's\ngot the right approach for it.\"\n\nStycze\u0144's knack for community management comes across in a blogpost shortly\nbefore launch which made clear what Manor Lords isn't - not a Total War\nkiller, not an Age of Empires homage, but a laidback, in-depth village sim\nwith some martial elements. \"A lot of people before release were quite worried\nabout that - or were talking about being worried,\" Bender noted. \"It's\nstrange, because most people understood that it wasn't Total War, but they\nwould say things like 'Oh, I'm worried that other people think it's a Total\nWar game'.\" While being compared to a series like Total War is obviously a\nplus in many respects - one I would not fault Hooded Horse and Slavic Magic\nfor leaning into - Bender thinks Stycze\u0144 has done a fine job of not letting\nthe comparisons go too far.\n\nManor Lords - Release Date Announcement Trailer - Xbox Partner Preview\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\n\"You see negative reviews that are saying, 'hey, I didn't like this system',\nor 'I thought more of this would happen', or 'I was bothered by this',\" he\nsaid. \"All that feedback, you see positive reviews, many with the same\ncriticism, but same but they still like the game [...] so it can go either\nway. But what you don't see is a deluge of people who are confused about what\nthe game is.\"\n\nIn general, Slavic Magic and Hooded Horse have erred on the side of just\nshowing people Manor Lords in action with their marketing. \"The marketing of\nthe game can go so many ways, right?\" Bender went on. \"Like, you can show a CG\ntrailer that just looks really cool and tries to draw everyone in - it looks\nlike a frickin' mediaeval action game, right. And then you have drawn the\nwrong people. If we did Heavy Metal trailers that are all CG of a king\nstanding at the top of a giant castle with vast armies of thousands beneath\nthem, you're gonna have a lot of disappointed people.\"\n\nFirst proper Manor Lords patch targets archers, trading, homelessness\nmechanics and over-expansionist AI\n\nRead more on Rock Paper Shotgun\n\nRight now, Hooded Horse are primarily supporting Stycze\u0144 by tracking and\ndistilling player feedback. \"We've got people mining the Steam forums, we've\ngot a quality assurance team that's working on organising all the reports -\nthere was a deluge of reports - organising that so the information can be\nprovided to Greg,\" Bender said.\n\nWhile the game has exceeded expectations, Bender feels that beyond a certain\nscale, the exact quantity of people playing a game and providing feedback\nbecomes meaningless. \"If you've got 100,000 people shouting at you, or you've\ngot 50,000, or you've got 200,000, there probably isn't all that much\ndifference in terms of how it affects your work. We knew it was going to be a\ntonne of people sharing their ideas and feedback and joining the community.\nAnd so we've had a lot of measures in place.\"\n\nBender's thoughts on Stycze\u0144's handling of Manor Lords in early access put me\nin mind of Larian director of publishing Michael Douse's recent remarks about\nBaldur's Gate 3's three years in the pre-1.0 wilds. Amongst other things,\nDouse stressed the importance of not trying to give players the sense that\nthey are effectively co-designers, or accommodate every piece of feedback that\ncomes down the pipe. \"It's scary,\" he said. \"It turns your company sort of\ninto a live service company, because you've got to feed that machine.\"\n\nBut he added that, given a healthy and proportionate relationship between\ndevelopers and players, early access development is an unequalled way of\ncultivating a following. \"If you don't know how to do early access, I wouldn't\ndo early access,\" Douse said. \"But if you are interested in creating a really\nstrong core gameplay loop and then building around that, to foster a strong\ncommunity, that's a really good way to do it. It's probably the best way to do\nit.\" I hope to hear similar things from Stycze\u0144, once Manor Lords leaves early\naccess an estimated year or so from now.\n\n## What's your favourite Metroidvania?\n\n34,555 votes\n\n## Read this next\n\n  * Manor Lords VR mod suggests that it would make a terrific god sim\n  * First proper Manor Lords patch targets archers, trading, homelessness mechanics and over-expansionist AI\n  * Manor Lords dev wants you to decide whether the game should allow egg monopolies\n\nEdwin Evans-Thirlwell: Clapped-out Soul Reaver enthusiast with dubious\nacademic backstory who obsesses over dropped diary pages in horror games.\nGames journalist since 2008.
