But this repetition has had the strange effect\nof dimming and narrowing our sense of what \u201cColumbine\u201d was in its details.\nFrom reading up on the tragedy in recent weeks, I learned that my own sense of\nColumbine had dimmed and narrowed very much over those 25 years. For me,\n\u201cColumbine\u201d had become a sort of placeholder, a vague signifier for the few\nthings it has in common with all the new massacres that bring it to speech,\nrather than the name of something that, when it happened, was catastrophically\nunique. I\u2019m not alone. People I\u2019ve told the things I\u2019m relearning have\nlikewise received these old facts as fresh revelations. The details of\nColumbine are sad and shocking, in other words, but we\u2019ve forgotten them\nanyway. They are worth remembering.\n\nColumbine was not unprecedented. I knew that. Armed people had shot up\nAmerican schools before, and Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the Columbine\nkillers, may have been inspired by some of these killings. But their truer\ninspirations were not shooters at all. They were larger events of mass mayhem\nand death. In an online journal Harris sketched his ambition to create\nsomething \u201clike the LA riots, the Oklahoma bombing, WWII, Vietnam\u201d, and\nvarious apocalyptic video games \u201call mixed together\u201d. Accordingly, he and\nKlebold conducted a careful study of their school\u2019s cafeteria, to learn when\nit would be most densely packed with students (11:17am, they determined). They\nbuilt several large propane bombs, timed them to explode at this peak moment,\nand, on the morning of their attack, carried them into the cafeteria, using\nthe lunch-hour busyness as cover for their unusual lugging and dropping of\nheavy duffle bags in a lunch room.\n\nSo Harris and Klebold murdered 12 students and a teacher in their attack, and\nthis was the deadliest school shooting in American history, at the time. But\ntheir plan was to kill many more \u2014 \u201cat least four hundred\u201d, Harris said. Given\nthe size of the bombs he made, and given the number of kids in the lunchroom\nat 11:17am of April 20, 1999, he may have hit or even exceeded his number, if\nhis poorly made bombs had actually gone off. The Columbine massacre is\nnotorious as a school shooting, then, but it was also, and perhaps more\nconsequentially, a failed bombing.\n\nBeside its failed-bombing aspect, another core fact of Columbine that had\nfaded in my memory is that its mastermind and driving spirit was a figure of\nevil so total and so extreme that, were he a character in a cartoon, you\u2019d\nthink him too cartoonish. Unlike many other school-shooters and mass-shooters\nboth before and after Columbine, Eric Harris was neither abused nor\ndelusional. He was smart and had a decent number of friends and was somewhat\nattractive to girls. He was fairly well-raised by a doting mother and an ex-\nmilitary father \u2014 who was kind of a jerk, apparently, but hardly a tyrant to\nhis two sons. Although early reports identified Harris as a bullied member of\na group of outcasts called the \u201cTrench Coat Mafia\u201d, he wasn\u2019t in TCM, and he\nwasn\u2019t bullied. Instead, he just wanted to do bad things, and, as he got\nolder, the badness he wanted to do expanded in scale until it was basically\ntotal. He wanted to kill humanity itself \u2014 and for no external reason. It was\njust what he\u2019d come to want. His journals often show him to be angry, but he\nwasn\u2019t despairing, and his anger, generally arrogant and affronted, was also\nexuberant. He was high-spirited in his desire to kill everyone, and self-\naware. As he put it in one journal entry, \u201cI\u2019m full of hate and I love it.\u201d\n\nSuggested reading\n\n##### The truth about about American mass shootings\n\nBy Kat Rosenfield\n\nPsychiatrists who\u2019ve profiled him since his death have declared him a\npsychopath. This is probably accurate, but it\u2019s also inadequate and\nunsatisfying. Like other psychopaths, Eric Harris totally lacked empathy and\nremorse, and he took pleasure in \u2014 and was very good at \u2014 deceiving and\nmanipulating others. But, unlike most psychopaths, Eric Harris had an active,\nurgent lust to kill all the people in the world. And he had a restless\npractical bent. He was eager to work. He recruited and groomed his brainy,\nfitfully suicidal friend Dylan Klebold and, over several years, he made and\ndescribed and carried out concrete plans for exploding, if not all of the\nworld\u2019s people, at least several hundred of its teenagers. Had his ambition to\nstage a large-scale massacre somehow passed before he could die attempting it,\nhad he finished school and continued on to a psychopath\u2019s semblance of a\nregular life, it\u2019s easy to see him becoming a serial killer. His writings\ninclude several passages like this: \u201cI want to tear a throat out with my own\nteeth... I want to grab some weak little freshman and just tear them apart\nlike a wolf, show them who is god.\u201d\n\nThat he wrote this stuff down, not only private journals but on a blog, and\nthat he was just such a bristling site of evil energy, raises the predictable\nquestion: \u201cHow did people not know?\u201d How could the nihilism and murder-lust of\na prolific internet braggart, a kid who was making plans and making bombs and\narranging for slightly older friends to buy him guns... how could all this\nhave not raised eyebrows and hackles and red flags? In fact it did raise those\nthings. This is the other incredible shock of the case that I\u2019d forgotten.\n\nMore than a year before the massacre, Harris fell out with his friend Brooks\nBrown and began to torment and threaten him, and so Brown\u2019s parents reported\nHarris to the county sheriff\u2019s department. They\u2019d seen the hair-raising pages\nfrom Harris\u2019s website and sent them to the sheriff as well. Investigators\nthere learned that, on top of the Brown harassment and the bloody fantasies\nand plans he described in his web journal, there was solid evidence that this\nHarris miscreant was building pipe bombs. They drew up an affidavit requesting\nthat a search warrant be executed on his parents\u2019 house.\n\nBut the affidavit somehow never left the sheriff\u2019s department. A judge never\nsaw it. A search warrant was never issued or executed. Again, this happened\nmore than a year before the massacre Harris and Klebold eventually committed.\nThen, in the days after the massacre, the sheriff\u2019s department learned they\nalready had an old and highly suggestive file on one of the killers, now dead,\nand that they\u2019d failed to request the search warrant for which they had the\naffidavit. That is, they could and should have prevented the massacre, and\nthey failed. At this point, with federal agents poking around everywhere, the\nsheriff and the local prosecutor did what many low-level politicians would do\nin such a situation. They hid the file and lied about it.\n\nMore from this author\n\n##### Big Tech has stolen our children\n\nBy Matt Feeney\n\nSuch notes of mischance and ineptitude have become a leitmotif of school-\nshooting narratives. When they emerge, as they always seem to, they inspire\nthe mix of agony and resolve carried in the phrase if only. If only the police\nhad better procedures. If only they\u2019d followed the good procedures they\nactually have. If only the parents had just paid attention. There\u2019s always\nsomething that might have been done differently. Next time we will do the\nthing that, inconceivably, we failed to do this time.\n\nAfter Columbine, law enforcement agencies throughout the US resolved to\nimplement one huge lesson from the police response: stop treating school-\nshootings as hostage situations, in which police set up a perimeter and wait\nto negotiate with the shooters. Assume there is no negotiating, only murder,\nand storm the building! Engage the shooter! This was thought to have become\nthe standard for active-shooter incidents in American law enforcement. But\nwhen, 19 years after Columbine, a disturbed kid began shooting up a school in\nParkland, Florida, the school\u2019s armed \u201cresource officer\u201d named Scot Peterson\nput himself in a safe position and waited for more cops to arrive.\n\nThis cop, a deputy in the local sheriff\u2019s department, would be vilified for\nhis cowardice and then prosecuted for neglecting his duty; but when his fellow\ndeputies arrived, they also set up a perimeter and waited as the shooter\nclaimed his 17 victims, instead of engaging him. When police from a\nneighboring jurisdiction arrived, they did finally storm the building and\nengage the shooter. The difference between two groups of officers, as the\nAtlantic\u2019s Jamie Thompson outlines in a remarkable article, was their\ntraining. The second group had received sound, clear training on quickly\nengaging active shooters. The first group, the sheriff\u2019s department to which\nthe vilified school cop belonged, had received vague, ambiguous training that\nseemed to tell officers to wait for a bigger team to arrive.\n\nThree years after the Parkland shooting, the elementary school shooting in\nUvalde, Texas, featured an even more paralytic response from local police, who\nwaited outside the school for 70 minutes as the gunman finished killing his 19\nyoung victims \u2014 after which came another agonised phase in which we looked to\nthe heavens and said: If only. These events, mass killings of schoolchildren,\nare so unbearable that our psychological response when they happen is to undo\nthem in our minds, to transport ourselves to the alternative timeline on which\nthey didn\u2019t happen. Then we can tell ourselves what actually happened was\nunnatural, owing to that one deviant thing \u2014 the uncanny failure to submit an\naffidavit, the singular cowardice of a sheriff\u2019s deputy, the tragic loophole\nin the system for preventing schizophrenics from having guns, the criminal\nnegligence of those oddball parents, who should have snooped on their\npsychopathic son way more than they did, who should have known their son was a\npsychopath in the first place, because we would have known. Any normal person\nwould have known.\n\nSuggested reading\n\n##### Why young men become shooters\n\nBy Park MacDougald\n\nAnd our legal and policy responses to these tragedies express, more or less\ndirectly, this need to undo them, fancifully and retroactively \u2014 sometimes\nthrough policies that are concretely illiberal and sadly unrealistic,\nsometimes through legal actions that are obvious acts of displacement and\nscapegoating, such as prosecuting Deputy Scot Peterson for doing what he was\ntrained to do, because we can\u2019t undo the outrages he was merely, haplessly\npresent for.\n\nRecently, in Michigan, a mother and father were convicted of negligent\nhomicide for failing to prevent their teenage son from bringing a gun to his\nhigh school and murdering four of his fellow students. This conviction does\nnot mean \u201c[p]arents are... expected to be psychic\u201d, the trial judge said.\nRather, apparently, they should just know in advance if their child is going\nto bring one of their guns to school and murder four people. After all, mere\ndays before his crime, these parents outrageously took their child to a gun\nrange, when a \u201creasonable\u201d parent, in the view of the court, would have known\nhe might be on the verge of murdering people. One legal commentator captured\nthis theory of responsibility in revealing terms. The parents\u2019 conviction, he\nsaid, \u201cis a shot across the bow to all parents, to all people who have\nfirearms in their house, to keep them locked up, if they could be in the hands\nof the wrong people\u201d. Parents don\u2019t have to refrain having guns and teenage\nchildren in the same house, in this formulation, or even keep their guns\nlocked up as a rule. They just have to lock up their guns \u201cif they could be in\nthe hands of the wrong people\u201d.\n\nThis is a very American hedge. The problem isn\u2019t guns being everywhere, or\nkids having guns. Across America kids have guns, even congressmen\u2019s kids. The\nproblem is the wrong people having guns. How do all those parents know they\naren\u2019t raising the wrong people? How do those congressmen know? The only real\nconfirmation your kid is one of the wrong people is when he goes to his school\nwith some of your guns and murders a bunch of other kids. Because access to\nlethal firepower is more-or-less universal in America, the contingencies of\nlife \u2014 the fallible insight and foresight of parents, their inconstancy in\nkeeping their millions of guns locked up, the leaky procedures of exurban\nbureaucracies, the variable quality of 18,000 separate police agencies, the\nhidden-ness and unpredictability of people\u2019s thoughts and desires \u2014 sometimes\nreveal themselves in the sickening manner of mass shootings. America can\u2019t do\nanything about the guns, and so it tries to stamp out the contingency. And if\nwe can\u2019t create a plausible fantasy of stamping it out, we mould it into an\neffigy \u2014 parent-shaped or deputy-shaped \u2014 and bring criminal charges against\nit.\n\nThe availability of so many high-capacity firearms, and the self-fuelling\nsequence by which the evil and unbalanced inspire each other to stage new\nspectacles of violence, has placed us in a bizarre condition \u2014 a mix of\narchaic thralldom before unruly fate and a very modern, and latently\ntotalitarian, urge to master the smallest and blurriest variables of human\naction with state power. To the problem of school shootings and other gun\nmassacres we direct an attitude of tribal magic, and also an ambition for\ntotal administration and surveillance informed by the latest teachings and\nterminology of mental science. As I noted above, it\u2019s hard not to view figures\nlike Deputy Scot Peterson and the Michigan parents as sacrificial tokens,\nritual offerings to the implacable god of crazed gunmen. And it\u2019s hard to miss\nthe strangeness of Republican politicians, and other small-government\nconservatives and libertarians, arguing for comprehensive national monitoring\nof everyone\u2019s mental health, so that some opaque procedure of psychological\nbureaucracy can determine who\u2019s not sane enough to exercise what they also say\nis a fundamental right.\n\nMore from this author\n\n##### California's criminals need an audience\n\nBy Matt Feeney\n\nIn other words, the distinctively American understanding in which unrestrained\nownership of and commerce in firearms is a non-negotiable component of\npolitical liberty in its very essence has been revealed as a strange bargain,\nfraught with self-contradiction. For us, the prerogative of owning and bearing\narms is a foundation of citizenship in a free republic, something guarded with\nmanly vigilance by our proudly armed yeomanry as they bear the standard\nagainst political tyranny, and also we might need the government to monitor\nour brains to keep us from going crazy and shooting up a school.\n\nIt may derive from convenient hindsight, gained from Columbine and its\nprogeny, along with my time living in several American cities where gun-death\nis its own social system, but I think this bargain is a fundamentally bad one.\nThe theory of citizenship that underlies American gun rights is bad political\ntheory. In the American ideology of guns, uninfringed gun rights belong to a\nmaximalist notion of political liberty. But our wide and unrestrained\ndistribution of guns directly and indirectly limits civic and political\nfreedom far more than even robust gun restrictions would. In encounters with\nour local agents of sovereign authority, police officers, we citizens must\nperform an elaborate kabuki of submissiveness and harmlessness, because the\npolice are, understandably, a little freaked out, pretty much all the time, at\nthe possibility that the person they\u2019re dealing with is carrying one or more\nof America\u2019s half-billion guns. That we accept this obligation to grovel\nbefore the sovereign\u2019s men as totally natural and not at all humiliating is a\nsymptom of the ideological numbing induced by our gun absolutism, our psychic\nneed to cope with its self-contradictions. It may happen one day that the\npolice, not knowing what you\u2019re up to and nervous about getting shot, will\nscream at you, \u201cGet on your knees!\u201d and at that moment you\u2019ll know you can\u2019t\nrefuse or even protest, even a little, as a citizen of a free republic. You\u2019ll\njust have to get on your knees.\n\nIf you understand the possession of firearms as a kind of executive power, the\nability of one will to coerce another, then you\u2019re forced into an uneasy\nrealisation as an American. For us, executive power is in fact all around us,\nall the time, requiring prudence and deference in our everyday interactions,\nconstraints on what we do and when, and \u2014 if the wrong dudes roll up on you \u2014\nabsolute submission, as of a subject to his king. When the wrong dudes rolled\nup on a friend recently, directly across the street from my house, and one of\nthem let an arm fall out his open window so that my friend could see the\npistol attached to the hand, there was only one thing for my friend to do,\npull his phone and wallet from his pockets and hand them over. From their\nstolen Volkswagen in that moment, these dudes wielded sovereign power, and he\nwas their subject. This is a lesson about the political dimension of crime,\nthe retail tyranny of forceful acts of taking, that the progressives who\noversee our permissive regime of law enforcement, and who view criminals as\nvictims of invisible structures rather than as agents using arbitrary\nexecutive force to coerce their fellow citizens, could stand to learn as well.\n\nMy friend is a mellow guy, but I\u2019m not. He took being the victim of a sidewalk\nhold-up in stride, glad to have escaped unshot from his encounter with armed\nlowlifes. But I seethed on his behalf, and my anger was a citizen\u2019s anger. The\ndudes in that Volkswagen, in using an armed threat to steal his property, had\nviolated his rights and, in forcing his submission, insulted his dignity as a\nperson and citizen. My fantasies about chasing down that car and, yes, using\nthe fantasy gun I magically had, retrieving the stolen wallet and phone and,\nin some of the angrier iterations, shooting those motherfuckers in the head as\nI did it, were those of a citizen wanting redress against an unjust exercise\nof arbitrary power. Of course those were just fantasies. There was no redress.\nHe just had to take it. When my turn comes, I\u2019ll just have to hide my\ncitizen\u2019s anger and take it as well.\n\nIn another recent local incident, a man walked onto his porch late at night to\nconfront two guys trying steal his car, to raise an objection as the legal\nowner of the car, and they each pulled out a gun and began shooting at him. He\njust opened his mouth to protest an act of arbitrary taking by armed agents of\na hostile political will \u2014 \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he said \u2014 and they made him\nknow, by firing 30 rounds in his direction, somehow missing him on the porch\nand barely missing his daughter in her bed, that his protests were not allowed\nin the autocratic regime they\u2019d set up on his property. These are real insults\nto the liberty of citizens, real acts of tyranny, frightening and sometimes\nlethal and undeniably political, that happen every day in this country.\n\n\u201cThese are real insults to the liberty of citizens, real acts of tyranny\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not even anti-gun, in any total sense. Some of my siblings and some of my\nbest friends own guns. I think hunters should be able to own guns. I don\u2019t\nthink law-abiding citizens should be prevented from owning a gun to protect\ntheir homes. But, as a precept of political theory, the idea that it\u2019s some\nkind of anti-republican tyranny for the central government, the actual\nsovereign, to exercise any control over the weapons of executive power \u2014 how\npowerful they are, how they fire, how many of them circulate in society \u2014\nstrikes me as insane.\n\nIt shows symptoms of insanity as political practice as well. You note these\nsymptoms in the things politicians say when, after the newest Columbine,\nthey\u2019re forced by their absolutist gun ideology to finger a culprit that isn\u2019t\nguns. After several school shootings, pro-gun activists and politicians have\nsaid that classroom teachers should carry guns. After the Uvalde massacre,\nTexas senator Ted Cruz said the problem was that schools have too many doors.\nAfter the Sandy Hook massacre, where 20 first graders and six adults were\nmurdered by a delusional man, Wayne LaPierre, head of the National Rifle\nAssociation and purported opponent of tyranny and champion of limited\ngovernment, decried the lack of \u201ca national database of the mentally ill\u201d.\n\nBut my favourite example of this phenomenon, in which the psychic prohibition\non acknowledging the obvious importance of guns in America\u2019s massacre problem\nyields a clearly compensatory sort of babbling nonsense, is when then-\npresident Donald Trump faced questions about a hideous church massacre in\nTexas in 2017. \u201cI think mental health is your problem here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have\na lot of mental health problems in our country, as do other countries. But\nthis isn\u2019t a guns situation... This is a mental health problem at the highest\nlevel.\u201d\n\nWe can leave aside Trump\u2019s tacit concession about guns here, what the mental\nhealth problem we share with \u201cother countries\u201d says about the massacre problem\nthey don\u2019t share with us. Instead, we can just focus on the fact that it\u2019s\nDonald Trump at the mic, telling us we need to get serious about mental health\nin this country, that the root cause of a grave public policy problem is\nsomething to be tackled not by the police, or by Donald Trump\u2019s best guys, but\nby psychotherapists. To me he doesn\u2019t sound entirely well in this moment. He\ndoesn\u2019t \u2014 as we sometimes say of people who are struggling emotionally or\npsychologically \u2014 sound like himself.\n\nMatt Feeney is an writer based in California and the author of Little\nPlatoons: A defense of family in a competitive age\n\n## Join the discussion\n\n### Join like minded readers that support our journalism by becoming a paid\nsubscriber\n\n### To join the discussion in the comments, become a paid subscriber.\n\n#### Join like minded readers that support our journalism, read unlimited\narticles and enjoy other subscriber-only benefits.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribe\n\n18 Comments\n\nMost Voted\n\nNewest Oldest\n\nInline Feedbacks\n\nView all comments\n\nEx Nihilo\n\n9 hours ago\n\nThe two lamest bromides offered as cures for the epidemic of violence\ndescribed are \u201cgun control\u201d and \u201cmental health\u201d interventions.

Either has to be nationwide or not at all I\u2019d think\n\n0\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nSteven Carr\n\n2 minutes ago\n\nReply to Billy Bob\n\nYou can\u2019t just go and get a gun from elsewhere and use it in Chicago! You\ncannot legally buy a gun in Indiana and own it in Chicago, Illinois. Chicago\nhas strict gun-control laws which make that impossible.\n\n0\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nSteven Carr\n\n14 seconds ago\n\nReply to Billy Bob\n\nTransporting a gun across state lines from a state with looser laws to a state\nwith stricter laws is generally illegal without properly transferring\nownership and licensing as required in the destination state.\n\n0\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nGeoffrey Kolbe\n\n29 minutes ago\n\n\u201cThe problem is the wrong people having guns\u201d And who defines who \u201cthe wrong\npeople\u201d are?\n\n0\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nBilly Bob\n\n4 minutes ago\n\nReply to Geoffrey Kolbe\n\nEasy.
