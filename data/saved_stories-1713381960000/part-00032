During my initial trip, I couldn\u2019t put words to the positive\nfeeling I experienced while roaming around the city. It was a blend of\nrelaxation, freedom, safety, friendliness, and convenience\u2014all at once. I\ndidn\u2019t do much; I wandered through the city, worked in coffee shops, and ate\nin random restaurants. Although I only stayed for a week, I knew I would\nreturn for a longer stay. That feeling stuck with me for a while, and I\ndecided to leave Beijing for Taipei, to get a sense of whether that was a\ntemporary feeling or if there was something more.\n\nFast forward: I stayed long enough (5+ years) to obtain my permanent residence\n(APRC)^1 and finally put words to this feeling I enjoy so much: my alertness\noverhead is nonexistent when I am in Taiwan. Every day, it\u2019s a pleasure to\nwake up, put on my flip-flops, and head outside:\n\n  * I can walk to the nearest convenience store or coffee shop located within a 5-minute walk^2 from anywhere I live.\n  * I don\u2019t even need to change my pajamas or check what I look like in the mirror; people on the street don\u2019t care.\n  * The convenience store clerk will greet you and go above and beyond to help you with anything you\u2019d need^3.\n  * In the street, I can pick any shared bike that will be amazingly maintained and available within a 5-minute walk from anywhere, for a ridiculous fee.\n  * I can have a 15-minute (sometimes 1-hour+) break outside a coffee shop with my laptop, without worrying someone will take it\n  * I leave my wallet and phone on the table\n  * When I lose my wallet, I\u2019m confident I\u2019ll get it back\n  * I can go out at 3 am in dark alleys without worrying about strangers approaching me and being threaten\n  * I can forget my sunglasses outside a school and find them back 2 weeks later:\n\n> I forgot my sunglasses at a vball court in a Taiwan's high school. Went back\n> to check 2 weeks later, with a really little hope to see them (14 days,\n> they're kids, of course someone will take them). But you know it's Taiwan...\n> And dang, they were there!

I had an amazing time, but something kept bothering me: I worried\ntoo much about silly things:\n\n  * I needed to check attentively my bags and phones when around people.\n  * In the news, I keep seeing stories about people being aggressed, murdered, or any kind of violence.\n  * I had to \u201cdress up\u201d to be normal and not feel judged by others.\n  * Friends reminded me not to put my wallet or phone on the table.\n  * People stared down at other people for no reason and made them uneasy.\n\nThose small things made me increase my vigilance level. I had to stay \u201calert,\u201d\nand it just made me feel more comfortable to stay at home than outside. This\ncontinuous level of alertness adds a mental overhead that stays. Maybe are\nused to used to it, but I guess that\u2019s something I\u2019m not used to anymore and\nmake me unfomfortable when thinking about it.\n\nHow Taiwan ended up like that could be an interesting topic. If I had to make\na quick guess, I\u2019d say that after the ROC (Taiwan) government retreated to\nTaiwan, Taiwanese didn\u2019t have to endure the same reforms that happened in\nChina since 1950 and followed the democracy path. The influence of the\nJapanese colonization for 50 years might have played a big role in the current\ntaiwanese culture and education. How kind, thoughtful, soft spoken\ninteractions are with taiwanese feels a lot like being in Japan than in China.\n\n  1. Taiwan APRC: A permanent residence permit that allows you to stay and work indefinitely in Taiwan. This permit almost never expires, as far as you visit Taiwan one day every 5 years. You can get it after 3 years working in Taiwan. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  2. Taiwan has 13,000 convenience stores, with one for every 1,582 people! (src). \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  3. Convenience stores are places where you can buy food, do groceries, pick up concert tickets, send a package, top up mobile contract, pay bills & get a bubble tea or hot latte, all in the same shop. \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n## Thanks for reading\n\nAs always, hit me up and let\u2019s hang out. I am thinking a lot about AI, Health,\nTooling, Hacking and other stuffs. I now focus on TaipeiDev and HackersBait.\n\nIf you are in Taipei come hang out.\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nE-Mail\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nFeel free to contact me @eric_khun\n\n", "frontpage": false}
