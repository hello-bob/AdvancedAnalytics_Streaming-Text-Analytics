Simply point your application under test\nto mountebank instead of the real dependency, and test like you would with\ntraditional stubs and mocks.\n\nmountebank is the most capable open source service virtualization tool in\nexistence, and will cure what ails you, guaranteed.\n\n## How it works\n\nmountebank employs a legion of imposters to act as on-demand test doubles.\nYour test communicates to mountebank over http using the api to set up stubs,\nrecord and replay proxies, and verify mock expectations. In the typical use\ncase, each test will start an imposter during test setup and stop an imposter\nduring test teardown, although you are also welcome to configure mountebank at\nstartup using a config file.\n\nmountebank employs several types of imposters, each responding to a specific\nprotocol. Typically, your test will tell the imposter which port to bind to,\nand the imposter will open the corresponding socket.\n\nView the getting started guide for a quick introduction.\n\n## Testimonials\n\n> With mountebank, maybe we could have built it in a day.\n>\n> Remus and Romulus, builders of Rome\n\n> With mountebank, all the world's a nail.\n>\n> Thor, God of Thunder\n\n> In fact, halfway through we discovered our corporate mocking software\n> couldn\u2019t handle the sheer amount of performance testing we were running as\n> part of this effort (we completely crushed some pretty industrial enterprise\n> software in the process). As a result, we made the call to move the entire\n> program over to a Mountebank OSS-based solution with a custom provision to\n> give us the ability to expand/shrink our mocking needs on demand.\n>\n> Capital One's Mobile Cloud Migration\n\n## Why mountebank?\n\nmountebank has the following goals:\n\nTrivial to get started\n\n    mountebank is easy to install, without any platform dependencies. mountebank aims for fun and comprehensive documentation with lots of examples, and a nice UI that lets you explore the API interactively.\nA platform, not just a tool\n\n    mountebank aims to be fully cross-platform, with native language bindings. Servers are extensible through scripting when the out of the box functionality isn't enough.\nPowerful\n\n    mountebank is the only open source service virtualization tool that is non-modal and multi-protocol. Commercial solutions exist, but their licensed platforms make it hard to move the tests closer to development and may even require a specialized IDE. mountebank provides service virtualization free of charge without any platform constraints\n\nNot all of mountebank's goals are currently implemented, but fear not, for he\nhas a team of top-notch open source developers, and they are legion.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
