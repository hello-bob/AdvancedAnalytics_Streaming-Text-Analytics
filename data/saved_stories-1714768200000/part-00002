This is clear from the\nlatest annual World Press Freedom Index produced by Reporters Without Borders\n(RSF). This finding is based on the fact that, of the five indicators used to\ncompile the ranking, it is the political indicator that has fallen most,\nregistering a global average fall of 7.6 points.\n\nSEE THE RANKING\n\nRead in Russian / \u0427\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c\n\n## Governments fail to protect journalism\n\nA growing number of governments and political authorities are not fulfilling\ntheir role as guarantors of the best possible environment for journalism and\nfor the public's right to reliable, independent, and diverse news and\ninformation. RSF sees a worrying decline in support and respect for media\nautonomy and an increase in pressure from the state or other political actors.\n\nAs more than half the world's population goes to the polls in 2024, RSF is\nwarning of a worrying trend revealed by the 2024 World Press Freedom Index: a\ndecline in the political indicator, one of five indicators detailed in the\nIndex. States and other political forces are playing a decreasing role in\nprotecting press freedom. This disempowerment sometimes goes hand in hand with\nmore hostile actions that undermine the role of journalists, or even\ninstrumentalise the media through campaigns of harassment or disinformation.\nJournalism worthy of that name is, on the contrar\n\nAnne Bocand\u00e9\n\nRSF editorial director\n\nAt the international level, this year is notable for a clear lack of political\nwill on the part of the international community to enforce the principles of\nprotection of journalists, especially UN Security Council Resolution 2222. The\nwar in Gaza has been marked by a record number of violations against\njournalists and the media since October 2023. More than 100 Palestinian\nreporters have been killed by the Israel Defence Forces, including at least 22\nin the course of their work.\n\nOccupied and under constant Israeli bombardment, Palestine is ranked 157th out\nof 180 countries and territories surveyed in the overall 2024 World Press\nFreedom Index, but it is ranked among the last 10 with regard to security for\njournalists (see the 2024 World Press Freedom Index security ranking).\n\n## Journalism vs disinformation in a super election year\n\nWhile 2024 is the biggest election year in world history, 2023 also saw\ndecisive elections, especially in Latin America, that were won by self-\nproclaimed predators of press freedom and media plurality, like Javier Milei\nin Argentina (down 26 to 66th), who shut down the country\u2019s biggest news\nagency in a worrisome symbolic act.\n\nElections are often accompanied by violence against journalists, as in Nigeria\n(112th) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (123rd). The military juntas that\nseized power in coups in the Sahel, especially Niger (down 19 to 80th),\nBurkina Faso (down 28 to 86th) and Mali (down one to 114th), continue to\ntighten their grip on the media and obstruct journalists\u2019 work. Recep Tayyip\nErdogan\u2019s reelection in T\u00fcrkiye is also a source of some concern: ranked\n158th, the country\u2019s placement in the Index continues to lose points in the\nIndex.\n\nIn the absence of regulation, the use of generative AI in the arsenal of\ndisinformation for political purposes is a concern. Deepfakes now occupy a\nleading position in influencing the course of elections. This was evidenced by\nthe audio deepfake of the journalist Monika Todova during the parliamentary\nelections in Slovakia (down 12 to 29th), one of the first documented cases of\nthis type of attack on a journalist with the aim of influencing the outcome of\na democratic election.\n\nMany governments have stepped up their control over social media and the\nInternet, restricting access, blocking accounts, and suppressing messages\ncarrying news and information. Journalists who say what they think on social\nmedia in Vietnam (174th) are almost systematically locked up. In China\n(172nd), in addition to detaining more journalists than any other country in\nthe world, the government continues to exercise strict control over\ninformation channels, implementing censorship and surveillance policies to\nregulate online content and restrict the spread of information deemed to be\nsensitive or contrary to the party line.\n\nSome political groups fuel hatred and distrust of journalists by insulting\nthem, discrediting them, and threatening them. Others are orchestrating a\ntakeover of the media ecosystem, whether through state-owned media under their\ncontrol, or privately owned media via acquisitions by allied businessmen.\nGiorgia Meloni\u2019s Italy (46th) \u2013 where a member of the ruling parliamentary\ncoalition is trying to acquire the second biggest news agency (AGI) \u2013 has\nfallen five places this year.\n\nPolitical groups often serve as channels of dissemination, or even instigators\nof disinformation campaigns. In more than three quarters of the countries\nevaluated in the Index (138 countries), the majority of the questionnaire\nrespondents reported that political actors in their countries were often\ninvolved in propaganda or disinformation campaigns. This involvement was\ndescribed as \u201csystematic\u201d in 31 countries.\n\nIn Eastern Europe and Central Asia, media censorship has intensified in a\nspectacular mimicry of Russian repressive methods, especially in Belarus (down\n10 to 167th), Georgia (103rd), Kyrgyzstan (120th), and Azerbaijan (down 13 to\n164th). Kremlin influence has reached as far as Serbia (down seven to 98th),\nwhere pro-government media carry Russian propaganda and the authorities\nthreaten exiled Russian journalists. Russia (162nd), where Vladimir Putin was\nunsurprisingly reelected in 2024, continues to wage a war in Ukraine (61st)\nthat has had a big impact on the media ecosystem and journalists\u2019 safety.\n\n## The best and the worst\n\nThe overall decline in the political indicator has also affected the trio at\nthe top of the World Press Freedom Index. Norway, still in first place, has\nseen a fall in its political score, and Ireland (8th), where politicians have\nsubjected media outlets to judicial intimidation, has ceded its leading\nposition in the European Union to Denmark (2nd), followed by Sweden (3rd).\n\nThe three Asian countries at the bottom of last year\u2019s Index \u2013 Vietnam, China\nand North Korea \u2013 have ceded their positions to three countries whose\npolitical scores have plummeted: Afghanistan (down 44 in the political\nranking), which has persecuted journalists incessantly since the Taliban\nreturned to power; Syria (down eight in the political ranking); and Eritrea\n(down nine in the political ranking), which is now last in both the political\nand overall rankings. The last two countries have become lawless zones for the\nmedia, with a record number of journalists detained, missing or held hostage.\n\n## The Index by regions\n\nThe Maghreb - Middle East region is the one with the worst situation in the\n2024 World Press Freedom Index. It is followed by the Asia-Pacific region,\nwhere journalism is suffocating under the weight of authoritarian governments.\nAfrica, although less than 10% of the region is in a \u201cvery serious\u201d situation,\nalmost half of the countries are in a \u201cdifficult\u201d situation.\n\nThe countries where press freedom is \u201cgood\u201d are all in Europe, and more\nspecifically within the European Union, which has adopted its first media\nfreedom law (EMFA). Ireland has dropped out of the Index\u2019s top three\ncountries, replaced by Sweden, while Germany is now one of the top ten\ncountries. Press freedom is nonetheless being put to the test in Hungary,\nMalta and Greece, the three lowest-ranked EU countries. Further east in\nEurope, the conditions for practising journalism are deteriorating due to the\nscale of disinformation and censorship of media outlets falsely accused of\nundermining national security or terrorism. This is the case in Russia\n(162nd), Belarus (167th) and Turkmenistan (175th), while in Georgia (down 26\nto 103rd), the ruling party is cultivating a rapprochement with Moscow. As a\nresult of improvements in its security indicator \u2013 fewer journalists killed \u2013\nand its political indicator, Ukraine (61st) has moved up 18 places.\n\nIn the Americas, the inability of journalists to cover subjects related to\norganised crime, corruption or the environment for fear of reprisals poses a\nmajor problem. The percentage of countries whose situation is classified as\n\u201csatisfactory\u201d (yellow) has drastically dropped from 36% in 2023 to 21% in\n2024. One of the world\u2019s biggest economic powers, the United States, has\nfallen ten places. In almost all of the countries in South America, the press\nfreedom situation is now \u201cproblematic\u201d \u2013 a deterioration due in part to the\nelection of press freedom predators such as Javier Milei and governments\u2019\ninability to reduce violence against journalists. Mexico continues to be the\nmost dangerous country for journalists, with 37 killed since 2019.\n\nSub-Saharan Africa was very affected by political violence during major\nelections in 2023. More than 8% of African countries are now coloured red on\nthe chart, twice as many as in 2023. Nigeria, Togo and Madagascar have been\nhit by waves of repression of reporters. The region is marked by the decline\nin security in several Sahel countries \u2013 Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali.\n\nIn the Asia-Pacific region \u2013 the world\u2019s second most difficult region for\npractising journalism \u2013 five countries are among the world\u2019s ten most\ndangerous countries for media personnel: Myanmar (171st), China (172nd), North\nKorea (177th), Vietnam (174th) and Afghanistan (178th). But, unlike last year,\nnone of the region\u2019s countries is in the Index\u2019s top 15.\n\nIn the Middle East and North Africa, the situation is \u201cvery serious\u201d in nearly\nhalf of the countries. The United Arab Emirates joins the eight other\ncountries in the red zone on the map: Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Palestine,\nIraq, Bahrain, Syria and Egypt. Palestine, occupied and under bombardment by\nthe Israeli army, and the deadliest country for journalists, is also at the\nbottom of the Index. Qatar is now the region\u2019s only country where the\nsituation is not classified either as \u201cdifficult\u201d or \u201cvery serious.\u201d\n\nIn all regions of the world, upcoming elections portend very strong pressure\non journalists.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
