It implemented\nthe channel-based concurrency model of Newsqueak in a compiled, C-like\nlanguage.\n\n## History[edit]\n\nAlef appeared in the first and second editions of Plan 9, but was abandoned\nduring development of the third edition.^[1]^[2] Rob Pike later explained\nAlef's demise by pointing to its lack of automatic memory management, despite\nPike's and other people's urging Winterbottom to add garbage collection to the\nlanguage;^[3] also, in a February 2000 slideshow, Pike noted: \"...although\nAlef was a fruitful language, it proved too difficult to maintain a variant\nlanguage across multiple architectures, so we took what we learned from it and\nbuilt the thread library for C.\"^[4]\n\nAlef was superseded by two programming environments. The Limbo programming\nlanguage can be considered a direct successor of Alef and is the most commonly\nused language in the Inferno operating system. The Alef concurrency model was\nreplicated in the third edition of Plan 9 in the form of the libthread\nlibrary, which makes some of Alef's functionality available to C programs and\nallowed existing Alef programs (such as Acme) to be translated.^[5]\n\n## Example[edit]\n\nThis example was taken from the Alef reference manual.^[1] The piece\nillustrates the use of tuple data type.\n\n    \n    \n    (int, byte*, byte) func() { return (10, \"hello\", 'c'); } void main() { int a; byte* str; byte c; (a, str, c) = func(); }\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Communicating sequential processes\n  * Plan 9 from Bell Labs\n  * Go (programming language)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Winterbottom, Phil (1995). \"Alef Language Reference Manual\".
