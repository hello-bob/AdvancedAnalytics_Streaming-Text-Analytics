The callers\u2019 playbooks would range from shocking fake police\ncalls, persuasive investment fraud or heart-wrenching romance scams. In an\nunprecedented law enforcement effort, a large-scale German investigation\nevolved into Operation PANDORA, which identified 39 suspects.\n\nOperation PANDORA started with a bank teller in Freiburg, Germany. When in\nDecember 2023 a customer asked to withdraw over EUR 100 000 in cash, the bank\nteller grew suspicious and quickly learned the customer had fallen victim to a\n\u2018fake police officer scam\u2019. He informed the real police, which prevented the\nvictim from handing the money over to the fraudsters.\n\nInstead receiving the massive sum of cash, the collectors were arrested by\nFreiburg Police (Polizeipr\u00e4sidium Freiburg) officers. Subsequently,\nsurveillance was placed on the victim's phone line. Looking into this\nindividual case, investigators soon realised that the telephone numbers used\nby the perpetrators could be linked to over 28 000 scam calls in only 48\nhours.\n\n## From fake investment opportunities to shock calls\n\nAs the investigation expanded, it was handed over to the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg\nState Criminal Police Office (Landeskriminalamt Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg), which was\nsupported by the Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt) throughout\nthe operation. Early findings showed that the perpetrators, located in a\nvariety of countries, conducted all kinds of telephone fraud. Scam callers\nwould pose as close relatives, bank employees, customer service agents, or\npolice officers. Using a variety of manipulation tactics, they would shock and\ncheat their victims out of their savings. Ranging from fake promises of\nlottery pay-outs, investment opportunities, debt collection demands, prepaid\ncard fraud, or shock-calls, scammers relentlessly targeted their next\npotential victims.\n\nTo learn more about how to protect yourself from scams such as these, read our\ncyber scam prevention guide.\n\nAs the investigation grew in size and complexity, law enforcement experts were\nclosing in on call centres located in Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo* and\nLebanon. The criminal network responsible for the fraudulent calls set up its\noperation in a coordinated manner, focusing on a different priority in each\ncountry. While debt collection fraud was predominantly conducted from Bosnia-\nHerzegovina, online banking fraud calls were made from Kosovo. Investment\nfraudsters called mostly from Albania and the criminals specialised in prepaid\ncard fraud sat at desks in Lebanon.\n\n## Countering call centres with a call centre\n\nGerman investigators managed to track the actual conversations coming from the\nmany call centres in real time. From December 2023 on, over a hundred officers\nwere deployed around the clock in the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg State Criminal Police\nOffice and subsequently secured the content of over 1.3 million nefarious\nconversations. In consultation with the Freiburg Public Prosecutor's Office\n(Staatsanwaltschaft Freiburg) and later the Karlsruhe Public Prosecutor's\nOffice (Generalstaatsanwaltschaft Karlsruhe), the aim was to prevent this\ncrime throughout Germany.\n\nThe posted officers monitored up to 30 conversations of varying lengths at the\nsame time. The State Criminal Police Office had set up its own call centre to\ncounter the international criminal activities. Investigators worked in shifts\nand had one primary goal: to prevent fraud from happening. As soon as it\nmaterialised that anyone who had received a call could fall victim to the\nscams, the police reached out to warn potential victims.\n\nIn just four months, over 7 500 calls surpassed the threshold that warrants\nauthorities to initiate criminal proceedings. In total, the deployed officers\nmanaged to prevent financial losses for the victims in over eighty percent of\nthese indicted crimes. In total, the potential damages would have amounted to\nover EUR 10 million.\n\n## Swooping down on call centres\n\nApart from preventing crime, investigators mapped the locations where the\ncalls were coming from. Obtaining information about the phone numbers, the\nowners, and the technical infrastructure such as servers, the plan was to\neventually take down the perpetrators' entire call centre infrastructure.\nEuropol supported this investigation by providing tailored analytical support,\nthus contributing to the overall intelligence picture.\n\nLeading up to the action day, Europol hosted several operational meetings,\nproviding operational coordination and financial support in preparation of the\nplanned raids. When the time came to shut down the criminals\u2019 operation across\nseveral countries, Europol hosted the operational coordination centre in its\nheadquarters. Apart from providing operational support on the action day,\nEuropol also deployed officers with mobile offices to locations abroad, thus\nfacilitating the collection and analysis of forensic evidence.\n\nOver 60 German law enforcement officers, supported by hundreds of their\ncolleagues in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo* and Lebanon, as well as\nEuropol specialists, swarmed dozens of residential and business premises.\nApart from arresting 21 persons, officers were able to secure extensive\nevidence such as data carriers, documents, cash and assets amounting to EUR 1\nmillion. A large number of electronic evidence was also seized, which should\nenable the investigating authorities to obtain information about possible\nfurther call centres and more fraudsters.\n\n## Participating countries:\n\nGermany, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo*, Lebanon\n\n*This designation is without prejudice to positions on status and is in line with UNSCR 1244/1999 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo declaration of independence\n\n## Tags\n\n  *     * Cybercrime\n    * High-Tech crime\n    * Social engineering\n  *     * EU Police Cycle (EMPACT)\n  *     * Operational coordination\n    * Operational support\n    * Information exchange\n    * Forensics\n    * Analysis\n    * Strategic\n    * Operational\n  *     * Press Release/News\n  * Press Release\n  *     * Germany\n    * Albania\n    * Bosnia & Herzegovina\n    * Kosovo\n    * Lebanon\n  *     * European Financial and Economic Crime Centre (EFECC)\n  *     * Pandora\n\n## Empact\n\nThe European Multidisciplinary Platform Against Criminal Threats (EMPACT)\ntackles the most important threats posed by organised and serious\ninternational crime affecting the EU.
