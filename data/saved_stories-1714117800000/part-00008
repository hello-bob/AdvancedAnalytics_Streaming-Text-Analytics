This decision was not made lightly as\nBlizzCon remains a very special event for all of us, and we know many of you\nlook forward to it. While we\u2019re approaching this year differently and as we\nhave explored different event formats in the past, rest assured that we are\njust as excited as ever to bring BlizzCon back in future years.\n\nOver the next few months, we\u2019ll be sharing more details about our launches\ncoming later this year, including World of Warcraft: The War Within and Diablo\nIV's first expansion, Vessel of Hatred. To celebrate these upcoming releases\nand to bring our communities together in new and special ways, we will soon\nshare some exciting plans for other industry trade shows and conventions like\nGamescom. We can\u2019t wait to tell you more about those plans soon. We\u2019re also\nlooking forward to the Overwatch Champions Series\u2019 stops at both Dreamhack\nDallas and Dreamhack Stockholm. And we\u2019re thrilled to be planning multiple,\nglobal, in-person events to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Warcraft,\nwhich will be held in addition to the in-game celebrations across our Warcraft\ngames throughout 2024. While these events are distinct from BlizzCon, we\u2019re\nharnessing all of our creativity and imagination to ensure that they carry the\nsame spirit of celebration and togetherness.\n\nOur hope is that these experiences \u2013 alongside several live-streamed industry\nevents where we\u2019ll keep you up to date with what\u2019s happening in our game\nuniverses \u2013 will capture the essence of what makes the Blizzard community so\nspecial.\n\nNo matter how you choose to connect with us at these events this year \u2013\nwhether it be in person or virtually \u2013 we can\u2019t wait to see you there!\n\n# Next Article\n\n  1.
