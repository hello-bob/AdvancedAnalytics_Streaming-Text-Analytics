This Note explores several of the factors that affect\nwhether a disc will fail within a short period or will continue to perform\nwell for many years.\n\n## Manufacturing quality\n\nPoor-quality discs (discs that do not meet standard specifications for proper\nmanufacturing and function) will probably fail sooner than good-quality ones,\ndue to rapid chemical degradation or physical damage. This was a significant\nproblem when discs were introduced^Endnote 2 and for at least two to three\nyears afterwards. Poor manufacturing is still a problem to some extent, either\nbecause of cost-cutting to meet competitive pricing or because of the growing\nlack of quality manufacturers producing these materials.\n\nDetermining if a disc is poorly manufactured is an impossible task without\nthorough testing, which likely would include accelerated aging. This is not\nfeasible for most archives, libraries and museums. In the absence of testing,\ndiscs with a recognized brand name can generally be assumed to be of good\nquality. Even though some large manufacturers label discs produced elsewhere\nwith their own brand name, most have no desire to be associated with an\ninferior product. Information on where the disc was actually produced may be\navailable by consulting the manufacturer and/or examining coding on the disc.\n\n## Materials used in disc manufacturing\n\n### CD-R\n\nCD-Rs are composed of several layers (Figure 1):\n\n  * the base layer\n  * the dye layer\n  * the metal reflective layer\n  * the top protective layer\n  * the label layer (optional)\n\n\u00a9 Government of Canada, Canadian Conservation Institute. CCI 131906-0001\nFigure 1. Cross-section of a CD-R.\n\nThe base layer of a CD-R is always composed of polycarbonate. However, the dye\nand metal reflective layers can be composed of various materials, and each has\nits own inherent stability. The quality of the top protective layer is also\nimportant.\n\nThe CD-R specification was designed around cyanine dye (shades of blue) and,\ntherefore, most of the early discs used it. Azo dye (deeper blue) was\nintroduced in 1996. However, neither of these dyes matches the stability of\nlight-green phthalocyanine, which is very stable to light, high temperature\nand high relative humidity (RH). Phthalocyanine was available in the early\ndays of CD-R manufacture, but it was not widely used until around 2002.\n\nThe type of dye in a CD-R can sometimes be determined by transmitting light\nthrough the disc and viewing the colour (Table 1). However, the presence of a\nthick, dark label may make identification impossible with transmitted light.\nIn these cases, reflective light can be used, although the colour of the metal\nreflective layer may alter the appearance of the dye colour. Note also that\nsome discs have pigmented bases, such as black or possibly a variety of other\ncolours; these colours do not indicate a different dye or metal layer than\nwhat is shown in Table 1. The type of dye in a disc can also be determined by\nconsulting the manufacturer or their literature.\n\nTable 1: identifying the dye in a CD-RDye and dye colour| Reflective layer|\nAppearance from the non-labelled side of the disc with reflected light|\nAppearance from the non-labelled side of the disc with light transmitted\nthrough the disc  \n---|---|---|---  \ncyanine (blue)| gold| green| blue  \nphthalocyanine (light green)| gold| gold| light green  \ncyanine (blue)| silver alloy| blue or greenish-blue| blue or light blue  \nphthalocyanine (light green)| silver alloy| light green| light green*  \nazo (dark blue)| silver alloy| dark blue or light blue| dark blue or light\nblue  \n  \n* Because the phthalocyanine dye is very light green, the label on the top of the disc may change the appearance of the dye. In this case, the colour of the disc with reflected light is generally a better indication of the dye type than the colour of the disc with transmitted light.\n\nA CD-player reads a disc by directing a laser light through the base and dye\nlayers to the metal reflective layer, which reflects the laser light back to\nthe player\u2019s signal detector. If the reflective layer is altered in any way,\nit will not perform as expected and the disc cannot be read. The metal\nreflective layer in CD-Rs has generally been gold, silver or a silver alloy.\nGold is very stable, thus discs with a gold reflective layer are not at risk\nfor \u201claser rot\u201d (a term used to describe the corrosion of the metal layer).\nHence, they have excellent longevity. However, silver and silver alloys are\nsusceptible to corrosion; CD-Rs with these kinds of reflective layers are more\nlikely to fail, especially if they are exposed to pollutants.\n\nThe top protective layer should have good chemical resistance and be rugged\nenough to protect the sensitive metal layer underneath it from handling\ndamage. If this layer is of poor quality or has not been applied evenly and\ncompletely on the disc, then early disc failure is likely. Some manufacturers\nmay specifically mention that their discs contain rugged topcoats.\n\n### DVD\u00b1Rs\n\nA DVD\u00b1R provides much more capacity than a CD-R and is, therefore, often the\ndesired format for storing information. DVD\u00b1Rs are composed of two individual\ndiscs, which are each half the thickness of a CD-R. They are manufactured\nseparately and then glued together. DVD\u00b1Rs can also have two information\nlayers.\n\n\u00a9 Government of Canada, Canadian Conservation Institute. CCI 131906-0003\nFigure 2. Cross-section of a DVD\u00b1R.\n\nDVD\u00b1Rs are produced with an azo or cyanine type dye, giving the discs a blue,\nbluish-purple or purple appearance. It is difficult to provide specific\ndetails about the dyes, as there is significantly less information available\non dyes used in DVD\u00b1Rs than in CD-Rs.\n\nThe metal layer in DVD\u00b1Rs is generally similar to that in CD-Rs (it is usually\ncomposed of silver, a silver alloy or gold). However, dual-layer discs use a\nsemi-reflective metal to allow some laser light to pass through to the second\ninformation layer.\n\nDVD\u00b1Rs do not require a top protective layer, as the metal and dye layers are\nsituated in the middle of the disc structure, sandwiched between two layers of\npolycarbonate (Figure 2).\n\nOne concern about DVD\u00b1Rs is the bonding adhesive. There are some anecdotal\nreports that DVD\u00b1Rs have separated due to adhesive failure or that the metal\nlayers have corroded due to the chemical reactivity of the adhesive. An\naccelerated aging study looking at the stability of DVD formats found this to\nbe potentially an issue, at least under elevated temperature and RH conditions\n(Iraci 2011).\n\n### BD-Rs\n\nA BD-R provides seven times the capacity of a DVD\u00b1R. In addition, with BD-Rs,\nthere is the option to have up to four information layers, thus providing even\ngreater storage capacity (well beyond what DVD\u00b1Rs and CD-Rs can provide). This\nincreased capacity makes it a suitable format for storing larger files\nassociated with high-quality video.\n\nThere are two types of BD-Rs (Figure 3). The first type uses a dye to store\ninformation and can be identified by its yellow base colour. The other type\nuses a non-dye silicon and copper alloy as the data storage layer. This type\nof disc appears dark grey to greyish-brown in colour.\n\nThe unique feature of a BD-R is the additional hard coat layer applied to the\nbase of the disc. Because the information-carrying layer and metal reflective\nlayer are applied to the bottom, or the reading side, of the disc, it is\nimportant to offer extra protection on this side of the disc so that the disk\ncan function properly.\n\nA study looking at the stability of Blu-ray media has shown that overall, BD-\nRs (whether they are the dye or the non-dye type) have rather poor stability\ncompared to some CD-Rs and DVD\u00b1Rs (Iraci 2018).\n\n\u00a9 Government of Canada, Canadian Conservation Institute. CCI 131906-0005\nFigure 3. Cross-section of a BD-R.\n\n## Disc recorder and reader compatibility\n\nThe original specification for CD-Rs accommodated discs with a maximum\ncapacity of 650 MB of data (74 min. of audio recording). When CD-Rs with a\ncapacity of 700 MB of data (80 min. of audio recording) were introduced around\n1998, they caused numerous compatibility problems. However, once a new\ngeneration of equipment was introduced, incompatibility became less\nsignificant. Nonetheless, early high-capacity discs (produced from 1998 to\n2000) may not perform well. In fact, they may perform no better than new high-\ncapacity discs played in older equipment.\n\nDVD-Rs generally have better disc and reader compatibility than DVD+Rs,\nespecially when using older readers or drives.\n\nOverall, single-layer recordable DVDs or Blu-rays have better disc recorder\nand player compatibility than multi-layer formats. To ensure that\nincompatibility of any optical disc type is not mistaken for disc failure or\ndisc degradation, it is important to know which format the equipment was\ndesigned to read, as not all drives can read both.\n\n## Recording techniques\n\nOne of the primary reasons for premature failure of CD-Rs, DVD\u00b1Rs and BD-Rs is\nimproper recording: the initial error rate was too high or the recording\nsoftware created other problems.\n\nAll recorded discs have inherent error rates, which are the number of errors\nper second when the disc is played. These are measured by BLER (block error\nrate) for CD-Rs, by PI8 (parity inner error rate averaged over eight blocks)\nfor DVD\u00b1Rs and by LDC (long distance code) plus BIS (burst indication subcode)\nfor BD-Rs. Players and readers can correct errors up to a certain point (and\nsome are more efficient than others); however, if there are too many errors or\nthey are too severe, the disc will not play properly.\n\nSpecifications state that the maximum allowable BLER for CD-Rs is 220 and the\nmaximum PI8 for DVD\u00b1Rs is 280, but it is preferable that the initial error\nrate for both of these types of discs be less than 50. For BD-Rs, it is\nrecommended that the average LDC be less than 13 and the average BIS be less\nthan 0.26, with a maximum BIS of less than 15. Satisfying the low error rate\nlimits will ensure that discs are playable in a wide variety of players, even\nthose with poor correction capability. This factor becomes increasingly\nimportant as technology obsolescence reduces the number of available players.\nA low error rate also leaves more room for additional errors before disc\nfailure occurs. For example, a disc with a low error rate can tolerate the\nadditional errors from a scratch or other damage without problems, whereas a\ndisc with an error rate that is close to the limit will likely fail if more\nerrors are introduced.\n\nLow error rates can be achieved by following a few simple recommendations.\n\n  * Ensure the recorder is well maintained and the disc surfaces are clean. Dust on discs will interfere with the recording process and cause errors.\n  * Confirm that the disc is compatible with the recorder being used. (Check the recorder manufacturer\u2019s literature to see if it recommends certain disc brands.)\n  * Use moderate recording speeds. CD-Rs were originally rated for speeds below 8\u00d7. Since 2000, these ratings have increased quickly, all the way up to 52\u00d7. However, using a recording speed between 4\u00d7 and 12\u00d7 for discs rated 52\u00d7 will produce the lowest error rates. DVD\u00b1Rs currently have maximum recording speeds of 16\u00d7 (2.4\u00d7 for dual-layer DVR+R discs), but the lowest error rates for single-layer 16\u00d7 DVD\u00b1Rs will be achieved at recording speeds between 4\u00d7 and 8\u00d7. BD-Rs have maximum recording speeds of 10\u00d7. It is recommended that discs rated higher than 6\u00d7 be recorded at 4\u00d7 speed.\n\nBefore embarking on new recording projects, one or two discs should be\nrecorded with the actual set-up (disc type, recorder, software, etc.) and then\ntested to ensure the error rate is sufficiently low. Specialized equipment is\nrequired for accurate error rate measurements. For large collections, it may\nbe feasible to purchase the equipment and periodically test discs in the\ncollection.\n\nIn the absence of specialized equipment, software such as Nero DiscSpeed can\nprovide some information on disc quality. However, because the test results\nare specific to the drive being used, it is necessary to test the same disc in\nvarious drives. Also, because Nero DiscSpeed reports mainly the major\nuncorrectable errors, a disc with a high correctable error rate could still\nappear to be a good disc. Nevertheless, this software is free and can at least\ngive a rough indication of disc quality. More information on using software to\ntest optical discs can be found in CCI Note 19/2 Error Analysis and File\nRecovery Software for Digital Storage Media.\n\nPoor quality software or inadequate recording methods, such as not finalizing\nthe recording session properly, can also lead to poorly recorded discs. These\nproblems are not related to disc degradation, but they still result in\nunreadable discs. Information can sometimes be extracted from these types of\ndiscs with specialized software (consult CCI Note 19/2).\n\n## Storage and handling\n\nAs with all other information carriers, storage and handling of optical media\nare critical factors in determining how long they survive. The following\nrecommendations will help maximize longevity.\n\n### Enclosures\n\n  * Store discs vertically in standard-sized jewel cases. Paper or plastic sleeves are not recommended as they provide little physical protection, they may interact chemically with the disc and/or they can scratch the disc surfaces.\n  * Use one-piece polypropylene cases for storage of discs that are handled frequently or when greater durability is desired.\n  * Remove liner notes or other materials from the jewel case when storing the disc (this is not essential if the disc is constructed with a gold metal layer and phthalocyanine dye).\n\n### Handling\n\n  * Hold discs by the centre hole and the outer edge between the forefinger and the thumb.\n  * Avoid touching the disc surface with bare hands, as fingerprints will interfere with readability.\n  * Label discs with a water-based permanent marker on the clear inner hub. Do not apply adhesive labels of any type.\n  * For more detailed handling information, consult ISO Standard 18938:2014, Imaging Materials \u2013 Optical Discs \u2013 Care and Handling for Extended Storage.\n\n### Cleaning\n\n  * Remove loose debris with a compressed air duster or a soft, non-abrasive tissue or cloth, wiping from the centre of the disc outward in a radial direction. Never wipe in a circular direction.\n  * To remove fingerprints, apply a small amount of dishwashing liquid to the disc surface and gently wipe it with a wet soft cloth. Afterwards, rinse the disc in distilled water and carefully blot it dry to avoid the formation of water spots.\n  * Cleaning procedures can scratch the disc surfaces if not performed correctly.\n\n### Environmental storage conditions\n\n  * Limit exposure to pollutants and light as much as possible. Note that the negative effects of light (such as fading of the dye layer) are not a problem if discs are returned to their cases promptly after use.\n  * Suitable temperature and RH conditions are described in ISO Standard 18925:2013, Imaging Materials \u2013 Optical Disc Media \u2013 Storage Practices. The recommended RH range for extended storage is 20% to 50%, with RH never falling below 10%. The recommended temperature range is from -10\u00b0C to 23\u00b0C, with the temperature never exceeding 32\u00b0C.\n  * Storage of discs in a cool and dry area will significantly increase media longevity.\n\n### Periodic testing\n\n  * If discs are stored under recommended conditions, test error rate and playability of representative samples every 5 to 10 years.\n  * If storage conditions are poor, test more frequently.\n\n## Disaster preparedness and recovery\n\nTo minimize the impact of a disaster such as a fire or flood, ensure that\nmedia are properly stored and that recovery procedures will be available, if\nneeded. Recovery procedures for optical disc media and other modern\ninformation carriers that have been subjected to various disasters are\ndiscussed in Technical Bulletin 25 Disaster Recovery of Modern Information\nCarriers: Compact Discs, Magnetic Tapes and Magnetic Disks.\n\n## Remedies for damaged discs\n\nDegradation and/or damage can sometimes render recordable CDs, DVDs and Blu-\nrays unreadable. However, some damaged discs can be restored to normal\nplayability. For example, there are treatments that can successfully restore\nscratched or warped discs. Also, a disc that cannot be played in one player or\nreader may play properly in another. Remedies for various degradation problems\nare discussed in Technical Bulletin 27 Remedies for Deteriorated or Damaged\nModern Information Carriers. Software discussed in CCI Note 19/2 Error\nAnalysis and File Recovery Software for Digital Storage Media can also be used\nto recover information form deteriorated media.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe longevity of recordable CDs, DVDs and Blu-rays can be maximized by\nadhering to the following guidelines.\n\nChoose quality discs, which can be identified by:\n\n  * a well-known brand name or manufacturer\n  * a recent date of manufacture (after 1995 for CD-Rs, after 1999 for DVD-Rs, after 2004 for DVD+Rs and after 2010 for BD-Rs)\n  * a phthalocyanine dye layer (not available for DVD\u00b1Rs or BD-Rs)\n  * a gold metal layer\n  * a tough top protective layer (only for CD-Rs)\n  * no signs of damage to layers\n\nRecord the information properly to ensure a low error rate (<50 maximum and\naverage BLER for CD-Rs; <50 maximum and average PI8 for DVD\u00b1Rs; <13 average\nLDC, <0.26 average BIS and <15 maximum BIS for BD-Rs).\n\nHandle the discs carefully:\n\n  * hold by the centre hole and outer edge between the forefinger and the thumb\n  * do not use adhesive labels or write on the top surface of the disc\n\nStore the discs properly:\n\n  * in a standard-size jewel case without additional materials in the case\n  * in a vertical orientation\n  * in a cool and dry environment\n\nIgnoring these guidelines can lead to premature failure of discs, perhaps in\nas little as 2 to 10 years.\n\n### The relative stability of optical disc formats\n\nTable 2 compares the relative stability of the various optical disc formats.\nThe most stable, and the one recommended for use when maximum longevity is\ndesired, is a CD-R with phthalocyanine dye and a gold metal layer (Iraci\n2000). However, lack of storage capacity and cost may limit the use of this\ntype of media.\n\nThe relative stability ratings shown in Table 2 are based on temperature and\nRH effects only. In the real world, if the storage environment contains\npollutants, any discs without a gold metal layer (regardless of dye type)\nwould likely rate lower than the ranking shown below. Therefore, although the\nCD-R with phthalocyanine dye and a silver alloy metal layer shows good\nrelative stability here, it may not be an appropriate choice for practical\napplications where longevity is important.\n\nTable 2: the relative stability of optical disc formatsOptical disc formats|\nAverage longevity  \n---|---  \nCD-R (phthalocyanine dye, gold metal layer)| >100 years  \nCD-R (phthalocyanine dye, silver alloy metal layer)| 50 to 100 years  \nDVD-R (gold metal layer)| 50 to 100 years  \nCD (read-only, such as an audio CD)| 50 to 100 years  \nCD-RW (erasable CD)| 20 to 50 years  \nBD-RE (erasable Blu-ray)| 20 to 50 years  \nDVD+R (silver alloy metal layer)| 20 to 50 years  \nCD-R (cyanine or azo dye, silver alloy metal layer)| 20 to 50 years  \nDVD+RW (erasable DVD)| 20 to 50 years  \nBD-R (non-dye, gold metal layer)| 10 to 20 years  \nDVD-R (silver alloy metal layer)| 10 to 20 years  \nDVD and BD (read-only, such as a DVD or Blu-ray movie)| 10 to 20 years  \nBD-R (dye or non-dye, single layer or dual layer)| 5 to 10 years  \nDVD-RW (erasable DVD)| 5 to 10 years  \nDVD+R DL (dual layer)| 5 to 10 years  \n  \n## Important note\n\nOne key to preserving information on optical discs, magnetic tapes and\nmagnetic disks is to make copies. Ideally, three copies of the information\nshould be created on at least two different types of storage media and one of\nthe copies should be stored off-site. If the same type of storage media is\nused for one of the copies, then different brands should be used.\n\n## Suppliers\n\nNote: The following information is provided only to assist the reader.\nInclusion of a company in this list does not in any way imply endorsement by\nCCI.

The \u2212R\nformat was released into the marketplace five years prior to the +R format\nand, therefore, is more commonly found and used. There are some technical\ndifferences between the two formats. For example, the +R format uses a\ndifferent system of tracking and speed control than the \u2212R format; this system\nis supposed to allow for better high-speed recording quality. In addition, the\n+R version has a more robust error management system, which could translate\ninto better-quality recordings, regardless of the disc brand or type being\nused. For the most part, these differences have not been a huge benefit for\nthe average user.
