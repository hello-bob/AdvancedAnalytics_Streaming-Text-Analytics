Over that year,\nand across its myriad revenue streams, the company generated \u00a51.67 trillion\n($10.8 billion) in net sales.\n\nOver this past year, Nintendo\u2019s many successes include The Super Mario Bros.\nMovie and Switch title The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, but as for\nmobile, any recent victories are much less apparent.\n\nIn fact, in its financial results Nintendo has conglomerated mobile earnings\nand \"IP related business\" into one figure totalling \u00a592.7 billion ($600.2\nmillion). This represents a mighty year-on-year increase of 81.6%, but\nNintendo has stated this comes \"mainly\" from the Mario blockbuster.\n\nThe ambiguous nature of its mobile earnings may raise eyebrows, therefore,\nespecially as Nintendo\u2019s mobile library has dwindled over the past few years\n(unlicenced Delta emulator aside).\n\nPlatforming ahead\n\nNintendo\u2019s total net sales rose 4.4% from \u00a51.6 trillion ($10.4 billion) in\nfinancial year 2023 to \u00a51.67 trillion ($10.8 billion) in financial year 2024,\nwhile net profit rose 13.4% from \u00a5432.7 billion ($2.8 billion) to \u00a5490.6\nbillion ($3.2 billion).\n\n78.3% of this fiscal year\u2019s net sales came from outside of Japan, and though\nhardware sales fell 12.6% year-on-year, digital sales were up 9.4%. The year\u2019s\noverall rise was therefore predominantly due to Switch software, mobile\nrevenue, and the Mario movie.\n\nThough, again, the latter two are muddied together into one result totalling\n\u00a592.7 billion ($600.2 million) in \"visual content, smart-device content and\nroyalties\". In the 2023 fiscal year - before the Mario movie\u2019s release - this\ncategory generated \u00a551 billion ($330.6 million).\n\nThe timing of this 81.6% rise in the year of the blockbuster film, then,\nwhilst no new mobile games launched and Mario Kart Tour officially stopped\nreceiving new content, makes it clear that Nintendo\u2019s mobile ambitions are a\nwaning priority as the company explores other paths.\n\n2017\u2019s Fire Emblem Heroes remains Nintendo\u2019s most lucrative mobile game,\ncurrently in its eighth year with over $1 billion behind it - Nintendo\u2019s only\nmobile game without the Pok\u00e9mon brand attached to do so. But the latest\nfinancial report gives no mention to Fire Emblem Heroes or any other\nindividual mobile title, making Nintendo\u2019s current stance clear.\n\nTags:\n\n  * Japan\n  * Financials\n  * Revenue\n  * Mario movie\n  * Earnings\n\nAaron Astle\n\nNews Editor\n\nAaron is the News Editor at PG.biz and has an honours degree in Creative\nWriting.
