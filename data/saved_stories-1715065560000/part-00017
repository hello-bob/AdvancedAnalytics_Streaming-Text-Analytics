Sophie, on the\nother hand, had a light-hearted post matching her hair color with her IDE end\nup on 4chan because the code snippet wasn\u2019t accessible \u2014 not an issue in that\nparticular context.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a new issue. Back in 2020, Twitter rolled out filters to curb the\nantics of reply guys. Come November 2023, Mastodon followed suit, introducing\nalerts on Android for those attempting to respond to posts from non-mutual\nfollowers or ancient posts.\n\nThese measures make sense. Sophie acknowledged Mastodon\u2019s blocking and muting\nfunctionalities in her post, though she found the implementation in her\nfavorite app, Ice Cubes, lacking.\n\nMaybe the biggest harm inflicted by 2010s social media platforms on public\ndiscourse was the notion that we\u2019re obligated to opine on everything, that we\ncan\u2019t resist hitting \u201cReply\u201d online\u2014especially if the other party isn\u2019t male,\nor if the matter doesn\u2019t concern us, or if the error is inconsequential.\n\nBelieve it or not, it\u2019s entirely possible to scroll past a trivial opinion or\ncomment and move on.\n\nOne unintended consequence of these regrettable incidents is the stark\nreminder that there\u2019s no utopia on the internet. While Mastodon is often seen\nas the antithesis of post-Elon Musk Twitter, it\u2019s not without its flaws. Don\u2019t\nget me wrong: I still believe Mastodon beats out Twitter/X and other\nalternatives \u2014 but only because those options were/are pretty dire.\n\n\u00ab I mostly use Signal to talk to people and I...\n\nSubscribe to my newsletter:\n\nRodrigo Ghedin is a Brazilian journalist covering consumer tech for a small,\nindependent publication called Manual do Usu\u00e1rio.
