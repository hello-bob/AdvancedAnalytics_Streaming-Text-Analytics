The paper uses administrative and survey data\nto investigate this growing wage disparity.\n\n##\n\nWhy it matters\n\nThis trend has significant implications for younger workers, who are facing\nincreasing difficulties in reaching higher-paying positions and experiencing\nslower career progression. The study suggests that this could have long-term\nconsequences, such as deterring younger workers from making important life\ndecisions like purchasing homes or starting families. As older workers enjoy\nmore successful careers, it explains why younger workers are falling toward\nthe bottom of the wage distribution and becoming less likely to hold better-\npaying jobs.\n\n###\n\nBy the numbers\n\n  * In the United States, the same pay gap grew by 61% between 1979 and 2018.\n\n  * Similar trends were observed in 14 other high-income countries, including the United Kingdom (41% increase from 1979-2018), Canada (46% increase from 1973-2018), and Germany (36% increase from 1996-2017).\n\n  * In Italy, the pay gap between workers over 55 and under 35 increased by 96% from 1985 to 2019.\n\n  * The likelihood of Italian workers under 35 belonging to the top quartile of weekly wages declined by 34% from 1985 to 2019, while the probability for those over 55 increased by 32%.\n\n  * In Italy, the share of managerial roles held by under-35 workers fell from 8% to 3% between 1996 and 2019, while the share held by over-55 workers rose from 12% to 28%.\n\n  * The age pay gap increased more in slower-growing, older, and larger Italian firms, with a difference of 38% between firms with below-median and above-median employment growth.\n\n  * In Italy, 78% of the total growth in the age pay gap was attributed to the deterioration in the pay rank of younger workers and the improvement in that of older workers.\n\n##\n\nDetails about the paper\n\nThe paper proposes a conceptual framework of negative career spillovers to\nexplain how an increased stock of older workers affects the age pay gap. In\nthis model, firms cannot easily change the contracts of older employees or add\nhigher-ranked positions to their organizations. As a result, a massive supply\nof older workers and declining economic growth restrict younger workers'\naccess to higher-paying roles, while widening the age-pay gap in favor of\nolder workers. The characteristics of these negative spillovers on younger\nworkers' careers align with the model's predictions.\n\n###\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nThe widening age-pay gap is not solely driven by higher returns to experience\nor skills possessed by older workers. Instead, the paper finds that the\nprimary cause is the difference in the positions of older and younger workers\nwithin the wage distribution, with younger workers facing increasing\ndifficulties in getting a better position, let alone the top. The paper also\nexamines alternative explanations, such as wage inequality, sectoral and\noccupational shifts, domestic outsourcing, and changes in workforce\ncomposition, but finds little support for these being the main drivers of the\nexpanding age pay gap.\n\n##\n\nGoing forward\n\nThe long-term effects of this trend on younger workers' career trajectories\nand life decisions remain to be seen. Policymakers and employers may need to\naddress the widening age pay gap to ensure a more balanced labor market and\nsupport the aspirations of younger generations. Future research should\ninvestigate the potential long-term implications of negative career spillovers\nbeyond slowed career progression for younger workers, such as the impact on\ntheir ability to purchase durables, invest in real estate, or start families.\nAdditionally, the study suggests that negative career spillovers may have\ndifferent repercussions on the careers of younger men compared to younger\nwomen, potentially affecting the gender pay gap as well.\n\nThanks for reading population.news!
