He analyzed five\nmillion scientific studies published last year and detected a sudden rise in\nthe use of certain words, such as meticulously (up 137%), intricate (117%),\ncommendable (83%) and meticulous (59%). The librarian from the University\nCollege London can only find one explanation for this rise: tens of thousands\nof researchers are using ChatGPT \u2014 or other similar Large Language Model tools\nwith artificial intelligence \u2014 to write their studies or at least \u201cpolish\u201d\nthem.\n\nThere are blatant examples. A team of Chinese scientists published a study on\nlithium batteries on February 17. The work \u2014 published in a specialized\nmagazine from the Elsevier publishing house \u2014 begins like this: \u201cCertainly,\nhere is a possible introduction for your topic:Lithium-metal batteries are\npromising candidates for....\u201d The authors apparently asked ChatGPT for an\nintroduction and accidentally copied it as is. A separate article in a\ndifferent Elsevier journal, published by Israeli researchers on March 8,\nincludes the text: \u201cIn summary, the management of bilateral iatrogenic I\u2019m\nvery sorry, but I don\u2019t have access to real-time information or patient-\nspecific data, as I am an AI language model.\u201d And, a couple of months ago,\nthree Chinese scientists published a crazy drawing of a rat with a kind of\ngiant penis, an image generated with artificial intelligence for a study on\nsperm precursor cells.\n\nAndrew Gray estimates that at least 60,000 scientific studies (more than 1% of\nthose analyzed in 2023) were written with the help of ChatGPT \u2014 a tool\nlaunched at the end of 2022 \u2014 or similar. \u201cI think extreme cases of someone\nwriting an entire study with ChatGPT are rare,\u201d says Gray, a 41-year-old\nScottish librarian. In his opinion, in most cases artificial intelligence is\nused appropriately to \u201cpolish\u201d the text \u2014 identify typos or facilitate\ntranslation into English \u2014 but there is a large gray area, in which some\nscientists take the assistance of ChatGPT even further, without verifying the\nresults. \u201cRight now it is impossible to know how big this gray area is,\nbecause scientific journals do not require authors to declare the use of\nChatGPT, there is very little transparency,\u201d he laments.\n\nArtificial intelligence language models use certain words disproportionately,\nas demonstrated by James Zou\u2019s team at Stanford University. These tend to be\nterms with positive connotations, such as commendable, meticulous, intricate,\ninnovative and versatile. Zou and his colleagues warned in March that the\nreviewers of scientific studies themselves are using these programs to write\ntheir evaluations, prior to the publication of the works. The Stanford group\nanalyzed peer reviews of studies presented at two international artificial\nintelligence conferences and found that the probability of the word meticulous\nappearing had increased by 35-fold.\n\nLibrarian Andrew Gray, from University College London.University College de\nLondres\n\nZou\u2019s team, on the other hand, did not detect significant traces of ChatGPT in\nthe corrections made in the prestigious journals of the Nature group. The use\nof ChatGPT was associated with lower quality peer reviews. \u201cI find it really\nworrying,\u201d explains Gray. \u201cIf we know that using these tools to write reviews\nproduces lower quality results, we must reflect on how they are being used to\nwrite studies and what that implies,\u201d says the librarian at University College\nLondon. A year after the launch of ChatGPT, one in three scientists\nacknowledged that they used the tool to write their studies, according to a\nsurvey in the journal Nature.\n\nGray\u2019s analysis shows that the word \u201cintricate\u201d appeared in 109,000 studies in\n2023, more than double the average of 50,000 in previous years. The term\n\u201cmeticulously\u201d went from appearing in about 12,300 studies in 2022 to more\nthan 28,000 in 2023. While instances of \u201ccommendable\u201c rose from 6,500 to\nalmost 12,000. The researcher jokes that his colleagues have congratulated him\non the meticulousness of his report, still a draft pending publication in a\nspecialized journal.\n\nVery few studies report if they have used artificial intelligence. Gray warns\nof the danger of \u201ca vicious circle,\u201d in which subsequent versions of ChatGPT\nare trained with scientific articles written by the old versions, giving rise\nto increasingly commendable, intricate, meticulous and, above all,\ninsubstantial studies.\n\nDocumentation professor \u00c1ngel Mar\u00eda Delgado V\u00e1zquez highlights that the new\nanalysis is focused on English-language studies. \u201cResearchers who do not speak\nnative English are using ChatGPT a lot, as an aid to writing and to improve\nthe English language,\u201d says Delgado V\u00e1zquez, a researcher from the Pablo de\nOlavide University, in Seville, Spain. \u201cIn my environment, people are using\nChatGPT mainly for a first translation, or even to keep that translation\ndirectly,\u201d he says. The Spanish professor says he would like to see an\nanalysis on the origin of the authors who use the unusual terms.\n\nAnother one of AI\u2019s favorite words is \u201cdelve.\u201d Researcher Jeremy Nguyen, from\nthe Swinburne University of Technology (Australia), has calculated that\n\u201cdelve\u201d appears in more than 0.5% of medical studies, where before ChatGPT it\nwas less than 0.04 %. Thousands of researchers are suddenly delving.\n\nLibrarian Andrew Gray warns there is a risk of broader society becoming\ninfected with this meticulously artificial new language. Nguyen himself\nadmitted on the social network X that it happens to him: \u201cI actually find\nmyself using \u201cdelve\u201d lately in my own language\u2014probably because I spend so\nmuch time talking to GPT.\u201d On April 8, the official ChatGPT account on X\nchimed in: \u201cI just love delving what can I say?\u201d\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage\nfrom EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition\n\n### More information\n\n### Marc Serrami\u00e0: \u2018If we all trust tools like ChatGPT, human knowledge will\ndisappear\u2019\n\nManuel G.
