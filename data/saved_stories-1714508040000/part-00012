Credit: Mary Caperton Morton\n\nYellowstone National Park, the world\u2019s first and arguably most famous national\npark, is home to one of the planet\u2019s largest and potentially most destructive\nvolcanoes. The 50- by 70-kilometer Yellowstone caldera complex is so massive\nthat it can really be appreciated only from the air. But although the caldera\nisn\u2019t always visible on the ground, it\u2019s certainly no secret: Copious thermal\nfeatures like hot springs and geyser basins dot the landscape and have\nattracted people to the uniquely beautiful and ecologically rich area for at\nleast 11,000 years.\n\nAs people seek to explain the area\u2019s geology, Yellowstone\u2019s unusually active\nlandscape has inspired myths and legends, from Indigenous origin stories to\nmisleading headlines about the future. Every season, recurring bouts of\nearthquake swarms trigger sensational stories that Yellowstone could be\ngearing up for another \u201cbig one.\u201d But there\u2019s no need to cancel your family\nvacation to see the park\u2019s free-roaming bison and grizzly bears: The\ngeologists who keep a very close eye on the Yellowstone caldera system say\nit\u2019s not going to erupt again in our lifetimes.\n\n### Becoming Yellowstone\n\nThe story of Yellowstone begins around 16.5 million years ago, when a plume of\nmagma began fueling intense bouts of volcanism along the border of what is now\nIdaho, Nevada, and Oregon. This magma plume, like the one that formed the\nHawaiian Islands, is stationary, but as the North American plate moves to the\nsouthwest over the hot spot, its surface expression migrates, creating a\n750-kilometer-long trail of volcanism, including dozens of calderas, across\nsouthern Idaho and into northwest Wyoming.\n\nThe movement of the North American tectonic plate over the Yellowstone hot\nspot has created a trail of volcanic activity across southern Idaho into\nWyoming over the past 16.5 million years.

Click image for larger\nversion.\n\nAround 2.1 million years ago, when the hot spot was centered under the\nsouthwest corner of what is now Yellowstone National Park, the volcano\u2019s magma\nreservoirs filled to bursting, resulting in one of the largest volcanic\neruptions in the geologic record. The explosion spewed ash and debris all the\nway to the Mississippi River, ejecting more than 6,000 times the volume of\nmaterial erupted during the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption. As the magma\nchambers emptied, the overlying layers collapsed, forming a massive caldera.\n\nThis cycle of explosive eruptions repeated twice more, around 1.3 million and\n630,000 years ago, resulting in three overlapping calderas. In between these\nevents, slow-moving lava flows drastically altered the landscape but didn\u2019t\naffect the region beyond the immediate area. The last of these lava flows,\nwhich formed the Pitchstone Plateau in the southwest corner of the park,\nerupted around 70,000 years ago, and the volcano has been relatively quiet\never since.\n\nNobody was around to witness Yellowstone\u2019s last lava flow; humans were not yet\nliving in North America 70,000 years ago. But people have been living in the\narea for at least 11,000 years, and thousands of artifacts and campsites have\nbeen found throughout the park, often concentrated around rivers, lakes, and\nobsidian sources.\n\n## This newsletter rocks.\n\nGet the most fascinating science news stories of the week in your inbox every\nFriday.\n\nSign up now\n\nHot springs dot the shores of Yellowstone Lake, the largest lake in the park.\nCredit: Mary Caperton Morton\n\nPrime campsites on the shores of Yellowstone Lake were continuously occupied\nfor 9,500 years, and obsidian mined from dozens of quarries around the park\nhas been found as far away as Wisconsin, Michigan, and Ontario. \u201cYellowstone\nwas a nexus for trade and culture and is crossed by ancient trails from every\ndirection,\u201d said Shane Doyle, a research scientist at Montana State University\n(MSU) in Bozeman and a member of the Apsaalooke (Crow) Nation.\n\nWhen Yellowstone became the world\u2019s first national park on 1 March 1872,\nIndigenous Peoples, including Bannock, Blackfeet, Crow, Flathead, Sheepeater,\nShoshone, and Nez Perce, were still living in and migrating through the area.\nTourism campaigns, however, touted Yellowstone as a pristine wilderness\nuntouched by humanity. \u201cThe earliest intentions were to make people think that\nthere were no Native Americans in the park and that they were never there,\u201d\nDoyle said.\n\nOne of the myths perpetuated by the park\u2019s second superintendent is that\nNative Peoples were afraid of the area\u2019s thermal features and avoided the\narea. But in fact, the hot springs and geysers were revered and used in\nceremonies and vision quests, as well as daily life for processing food and\ntrade goods, Doyle said. \u201cNative people believe that Yellowstone is a very\npowerful and sacred place. They weren\u2019t afraid of it. They had great respect\nfor it, and geology plays an important role in many tribal legends and origin\nstories.\u201d\n\nSuch stories are only recently being shared with park visitors, Doyle said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve finally seen a breakthrough in the last year in efforts to educate\nvisitors about Native history and culture. I look forward to seeing more\nsignage and a more prominent Native presence throughout the park.\u201d\n\n### The Supervolcano Myth\n\nYellowstone has an impressive volcanic resume\u2014but don\u2019t call it a\nsupervolcano, a colloquial term with no scientific definition. Instead,\ngeoscientists prefer the term Yellowstone caldera system or Yellowstone\ncaldera complex. \u201cI wish the word supervolcano could be banished from the\nrecord as it enforces the myth that Yellowstone only produces supereruptions,\u201d\nsaid Michael Poland, the current scientist-in-charge of the Yellowstone\nVolcano Observatory (YVO), the research consortium that monitors the volcano.\n\n> \u201cThe most common misconception about Yellowstone is that it\u2019s overdue for an\n> eruption. But volcanoes don\u2019t work like that.\u201d\n\nIn its 2.2-million-year history, the Yellowstone caldera system has erupted\ncatastrophically only three times, while producing many localized lava flows.\n\u201cYellowstone is not going to erupt again anytime soon, and when it does, it\u2019s\nmuch more likely to be a lava flow than an explosive event,\u201d Poland said.\n\u201cThese lava flows are really impressive. They can be hundreds of feet thick.\nBut they\u2019re not particularly hazardous beyond the immediate area.\u201d\n\nThe last supereruption (defined as an event greater than magnitude 8 on the\nvolcano explosivity index) at Yellowstone took place 630,000 years ago. The\nlast lava flow took place 70,000 years ago. But the relative quiescence since\nthe last eruptions doesn\u2019t mean the system is due for an eruption, Poland\nsaid.\n\n\u201cThe most common misconception about Yellowstone is that it\u2019s overdue for an\neruption. But volcanoes don\u2019t work like that,\u201d he said. \u201cThey erupt when there\nis a sufficient supply of eruptable magma in the subsurface and enough\npressure to get that magma to the surface, and right now, neither condition\nexists at Yellowstone.\u201d\n\nCurrently, the two stacked magma chambers under Yellowstone are mostly\nstagnant. \u201cPeople tend to picture a giant pool of molten magma down there just\nwaiting to erupt, but that\u2019s not the case,\u201d said Jamie Farrell, a seismologist\nat the University of Utah who runs the seismic monitoring program at\nYellowstone.\n\n> \u201cWe have a lot of confidence that if Yellowstone were gearing up for an\n> eruptive event that we would know about it years in advance. It\u2019s not going\n> to take us by surprise.\u201d\n\nSeismic studies that image the interior of Earth indicate that the two magma\nreservoirs contain between only 5% and 15% molten material. \u201cThat tells us the\nvolcanic system is nowhere near primed for an eruption,\u201d Farrell said.\n\u201cTypically, you need at least 50% melt for it to mobilize and begin moving\ntoward the surface.\u201d\n\nThe process of filling a magma chamber with molten material is not a quiet\none. \u201cWe would expect to see increased seismicity, ground deformation, changes\nin thermal and gas emissions for decades and perhaps centuries in advance of\nan eruption,\u201d Poland said. \u201cWe have a lot of confidence that if Yellowstone\nwere gearing up for an eruptive event, we would know about it years in\nadvance. It\u2019s not going to take us by surprise.\u201d\n\n### Next-Level Neighborhood Watch\n\nVery little of what happens at Yellowstone above or below the ground goes\nunnoticed; the Yellowstone caldera is one of the best-monitored volcanoes on\nEarth. Satellites keep an eye on the seasonal cycles of ground deformation,\nwhile thermal and gas monitoring networks detect subtle changes in heat and\ngas outputs.\n\nA map of the overlapping calderas, lava flows, and potential hazards of\nYellowstone, including earthquakes and hydrothermal explosion craters. Credit:\nUSGS. Click image for larger version.\n\nDozens of permanent and hundreds of portable seismic stations spread\nthroughout the park and around its borders keep tabs on Yellowstone\u2019s near-\nconstant quivering, including earthquake swarms, where hundreds of small\nearthquakes can occur over a period of days to months. These events often\ninspire sensational headlines that Yellowstone is awakening\u2014but they are not\nharbingers of catastrophe, Farrell said, as they are usually triggered by\nwater moving underground in the geothermal areas.\n\nThe most likely hazards to strike the park on human timescales are not magma\nrelated, Farrell said. \u201cThe most likely geologic hazard would probably be a\nhydrothermal explosion.\u201d As mineral-rich groundwater moves through hot springs\nand geysers, deposits thicken on the walls of the underground passages. Clogs\ncan cause pressure to build up until an explosion occurs, sometimes forming a\ncrater at the surface. \u201cSome of these explosions can be pretty large. They\nhappen annually, mostly in the backcountry, but they have happened in the\nmajor geyser basins before.\u201d\n\nExplosions can also occur when groundwater rapidly flashes into steam. \u201cIn\nYellowstone, there are a dozen or so decent-sized craters, a few hundreds of\nmeters across, from hydrothermal explosion events,\u201d Poland said \u201cIf that were\nto happen today in the front country, it could cause a lot of damage.\u201d\n\nThe magnitude 7.3 Madison River Canyon earthquake kicked off a massive\nlandslide that dammed the Madison River in 1959. Credit Mary Caperton Morton\n\nThe next most likely hazard to affect park visitors is a large earthquake,\nPoland said. On 17 August 1959, a magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck the\nYellowstone area and kicked off a 73-million-metric-ton landslide that dammed\nthe Madison River. The landslide and resulting flooding killed 28 people, most\nof whom were camping along the river, and drastically changed the landscape by\ncreating a new lake, Quake Lake.\n\nToday, another \u201cstrong earthquake could do a lot of damage to the park and\nimpact visitors, but it\u2019s not going to set off the volcano,\u201d Poland said. \u201cThe\nsystem doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d\n\nYellowstone\u2019s hydrothermal systems, including the Old Faithful geyser, are\namong the most dynamic geologic elements in the park. Credit: Mary Caperton\nMorton\n\nHowever, a big earthquake could affect the hydrothermal systems and perhaps\nincrease or decrease geyser activity, Farrell said. \u201cThe thermal areas are\nvery dynamic. There are a lot of old, inactive hydrothermal areas in the park,\nand we\u2019ve seen new ones form in the past few decades. Old Faithful could shut\ndown tomorrow, which would be a big change to the Yellowstone experience.\u201d\n\nFarrell and his team are hoping to learn more about what factors drive changes\nto the park\u2019s thermal features by deploying hundreds of battery-powered\nseismic instruments throughout the geyser basins. \u201cWe are hoping to develop\nhydrothermal monitoring systems, where we use seismometers, GPS stations,\nthermal and gas monitoring instruments to track changes on short timescales,\u201d\nhe said. The monitoring systems, which are on the YVO\u2019s 10-year plan, may also\nprovide some way of forewarning of impending hydrothermal explosions. \u201cThat\u2019s\na hazard we still don\u2019t know much about,\u201d Poland said.\n\n### What\u2019s Scarier Than Lions and Bisons and Bears? Climate Change, Oh My!\n\nThe author waits for a herd of bison to pass on the Hellroaring Creek segment\nof the Black Canyon of the Yellowstone hike. Credit: Mary Caperton Morton\n\nIn April, I backpacked through the Black Canyon of the Yellowstone, a\n32-kilometer trek known for being the best early-season backpacking trip in\nthe park. In the 3 days we spent on trail, we saw only two day hikers, dodged\nhundreds of bison and elk, and followed in the frighteningly fresh footsteps\nof both grizzly bears and mountain lions.\n\nWhen hiking in bear country, I travel in groups, make noise (I skip the bells\nand use my voice), carry bear spray, and store all food and scented items away\nfrom camp. In hundreds of kilometers of hiking in the Greater Yellowstone\nEcosystem, I\u2019ve seen a few bears in distant, peaceful encounters, and I\u2019m sure\nmany more have seen or heard me coming and stepped off the trail to let me\npass. Bears have a huge task in feeding themselves with a mostly plant based\ndiet, and I firmly believe that humans are not on their menu\u2014they don\u2019t want\nto encounter us any more than we want to encounter them.\n\nFresh tracks left by one of the estimated 150 grizzly bears that live within\nthe boundaries of Yellowstone National Park. Credit: Mary Caperton Morton\n\nKeeping a clean camp and storing food properly high in a tree, up a bear pole,\nor in an approved bear canister are the best ways to keep bears from\nassociating humans with food rewards. A famous park service saying is \u201ca fed\nbear is a dead bear\u201d: Sloppy people are far more dangerous to bears than bears\nare to people. Hiking, camping, and doing fieldwork in grizzly bear country\ncan be stressful, agrees Madison Myers, a volcanologist at MSU in Bozeman, but\nwith proper precautions, \u201cI am honored to share space with them.\u201d\n\nYellowstone is famous for its long, deep winters, and a few decades ago, I\nmight have needed snowshoes to hike the Black Canyon in early April and may\nhave also been less likely to cross paths with still-hibernating bears. But\nthe spring thaw is coming weeks earlier to Yellowstone, affecting snowpack,\nstreamflow, water availability, vegetation patterns, and bear sleep schedules\nand stoking landscape-scale wildfires.\n\nIn June, a team led by researchers at MSU released a new \u201cGreater Yellowstone\nClimate Assessment\u201d that found that average temperatures are the warmest\nthey\u2019ve been in the past 800,000 years, and carbon dioxide levels are the\nhighest they\u2019ve been in the past 3.3 million years. Since 1950, average\ntemperatures have increased by 1.3\u00b0C, and the report predicts that without\ndrastic measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, temperatures could soar\nby as much as 5.6\u00b0C by the end of the 21st century.\n\nBison frequently roam on Yellowstone\u2019s roads, often causing traffic jams.\nCredit: Mary Caperton Morton\n\nGrizzly tracks are formidable, but the human footprint on Yellowstone is large\nand getting larger. In 2019, more than 4.2 million people visited the park,\nwith visitation expected to soar even higher in 2021. Often portrayed as a\nvast wilderness, in reality the nearly 9,000-square-kilometer park is\ncrisscrossed by more than 750 kilometers of roads that connect more than 1,500\nbuildings, including nine hotels and 11 visitor centers and museums.\n\n\u201cOn human timescales, I don\u2019t think people will see that much large-scale\ngeologic change in Yellowstone,\u201d said Carol Stein, a geophysicist at the\nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago. \u201cYellowstone is a lovely place and will\nstay lovely for a long time, but climate change is happening before our eyes\nand quickly altering the landscape. In our lifetimes, I expect climate will be\nthe dominating force of change in Yellowstone.\u201d\n\n### Yellowstone, Forever\n\nAsk the average person to imagine the future of Yellowstone, and that person\nmight picture a mushroom cloud looming over a smoking crater. \u201cWhen people\nhear I study Yellowstone, they always ask, \u2018When is it going to erupt?\u2019 and\nwhen I tell them that the chance of an eruption in their lifetime is next to\nnothing, they\u2019re almost disappointed,\u201d Myers said. On longer timescales,\n\u201cthere is a chance of another eruption on million-year timescales, or it may\nnever erupt again at all.\u201d\n\n> \u201cThere is a chance of another eruption on million-year timescales, or it may\n> never erupt again at all.\u201d\n\nOn multimillion-year timescales, as the North American plate continues moving\nsouthwest over the Yellowstone hot spot, the plume will migrate to the\nnortheast, toward the thicker crust of the Beartooth Plateau. \u201cWhen the plume\nhits the Beartooth Mountains, we don\u2019t know what will happen,\u201d Myers said.\n\u201cCan volcanism work its way up through the plateau? Or will it somehow flow\naround the sides? Or will it wait until it pops out the other side near\nBillings in another 5 million years or so?\u201d\n\nCould another Yellowstone arise in Montana\u2019s largest city in a few million\nyears? Will Billings even be on the map by then? Only geologic time will tell.\n\n### Author Information\n\nMary Caperton Morton (@theblondecoyote), Science Writer\n\nLiving in Geologic Time is a series of personal accounts that highlight the\npast, present, and future of famous landmarks on geologic timescales.\n\nCitation:\n\nMorton, M.
