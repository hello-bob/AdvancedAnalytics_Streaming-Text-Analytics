According to the theory, four rules \u2014 an enemy of an enemy is\na friend, a friend of a friend is a friend, a friend of an enemy is an enemy\nand, finally, an enemy of a friend is an enemy \u2014 lead to balanced\nrelationships.\n\nAlthough countless studies have tried to confirm this theory using network\nscience and mathematics, their efforts have fallen short, as networks deviate\nfrom perfectly balanced relationships. Hence, the real question is whether\nsocial networks are more balanced than expected according to an adequate\nnetwork model. Most network models were too simplified to fully capture the\ncomplexities within human relationships that affect social balance, yielding\ninconsistent results on whether deviations observed from the network model\nexpectations are in line with the theory of social balance.\n\nThe Northwestern team, however, successfully integrated the two key pieces\nthat make Heider\u2019s social framework work. In real life, not everyone knows\neach other, and some people are more positive than others. Researchers have\nlong known that each factor influences social ties, but existing models could\nonly account for one factor at a time. By simultaneously incorporating both\nconstraints, the researchers\u2019 resulting network model finally confirmed the\nfamous theory some 80 years after Heider first proposed it.\n\nThe useful new framework could help researchers better understand social\ndynamics, including political polarization and international relations, as\nwell as any system that comprises a mixture of positive and negative\ninteractions, such as neural networks or drug combinations.\n\n\u201cWe have always thought this social intuition works, but we didn\u2019t know why it\nworked,\u201d said Northwestern\u2019s Istv\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs, the study\u2019s senior author. \u201cAll we\nneeded was to figure out the math. If you look through the literature, there\nare many studies on the theory, but there\u2019s no agreement among them. For\ndecades, we kept getting it wrong. The reason is because real life is\ncomplicated. We realized that we needed to take into account both constraints\nsimultaneously: who knows whom and that some people are just friendlier than\nothers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can finally conclude that social networks align with expectations that\nwere formed 80 years ago,\u201d added Bingjie Hao, the study\u2019s first author. \u201cOur\nfindings also have broad applications for future use. Our mathematics allows\nus to incorporate constraints on the connections and the preference of\ndifferent entities in the system. That will be useful for modeling other\nsystems beyond social networks.\u201d\n\nKov\u00e1cs is an assistant professor of Physics and Astronomy at Northwestern\u2019s\nWeinberg College of Arts and Sciences. Hao is a postdoctoral researcher in his\nlaboratory.\n\n## What is social balance theory?\n\nUsing groups of three people, Heider\u2019s social balance theory maintains the\nassumption that humans strive for comfortable, harmonious relationships. In\nbalanced relationships, all people like each other. Or, if one person dislikes\ntwo people, those two are friends. Imbalanced relationships exist when all\nthree people dislike each other, or one person likes two people who dislike\neach other, leading to anxiety and tension. Studying such frustrated systems\nled to the 2021 Nobel Prize in physics to Italian theoretical physicist\nGiorgio Parisi, who shared the prize with climate modelers Syukuro Manabe and\nKlaus Hasselmann.\n\n\u201cIt seems very aligned with social intuition,\u201d Kov\u00e1cs said. \u201cYou can see how\nthis would lead to extreme polarization, which we do see today in terms of\npolitical polarization. If everyone you like also dislikes all the people you\ndon\u2019t like, then that results in two parties that hate each other.\u201d\n\nWe have always thought this social intuition works, but we didn\u2019t know why it\nworked. All we needed was to figure out the math.\u201d\n\nIstvan Kovacs physicist\n\nHowever, it has been challenging to collect large-scale data where not only\nfriends but also enemies are listed. With the onset of Big Data in the early\n2000s, researchers tried to see if such signed data from social networks could\nconfirm Heider\u2019s theory. When generating networks to test Heider\u2019s rules,\nindividual people serve as nodes. The edges connecting nodes represent the\nrelationships among individuals.\n\nIf the nodes are not friends, then the edge between them is assigned a\nnegative (or hostile) value. If the nodes are friends, then the edge is marked\nwith a positive (or friendly) value. In previous models, edges were assigned\npositive or negative values at random, without respecting both constraints.\nNone of those studies accurately captured the realities of social networks.\n\n## Finding success in constraints\n\nTo explore the problem, Kov\u00e1cs and Hao turned to four large-scale, publicly\navailable signed network datasets previously curated by social scientists,\nincluding data from (1) user-rated comments on social news site Slashdot; (2)\nexchanges among Congressional members on the House floor; (3) interactions\namong Bitcoin traders; and (4) product reviews from consumer review site\nEpinions.\n\nIn their network model, Kov\u00e1cs and Hao did not assign truly random negative or\npositive values to the edges. For every interaction to be random, every node\nwould need to have an equal chance of encountering one another. In real life,\nhowever, not everyone actually knows everyone else within a social network.\nFor example, a person might not ever encounter their friend\u2019s friend, who\nlives on the other side of the world.\n\nTo make their model more realistic, Kov\u00e1cs and Hao distributed positive or\nnegative values based on a statistical model that describes the probability of\nassigning positive or negative signs to the interactions that exist. That kept\nthe values random \u2014 but random within limits given by constraints of the\nnetwork topology. In addition to who knows whom, the team took into account\nthat some people in life are just friendlier than others. Friendly people are\nmore likely to have more positive \u2014 and fewer hostile \u2014 interactions.\n\nBy introducing these two constraints, the resulting model showed that large-\nscale social networks consistently align with Heider\u2019s social balance theory.\nThe model also highlighted patterns beyond three nodes. It shows that social\nbalance theory applies to larger graphlets, which involve four and possibly\neven more nodes.\n\n\u201cWe know now that you need to take into account these two constraints,\u201d Kov\u00e1cs\nsaid. \u201cWithout those, you cannot come up with the right mechanisms. It looks\ncomplicated, but it\u2019s actually fairly simple mathematics.\u201d\n\n## Insights into polarization and beyond\n\nKov\u00e1cs and Hao currently are exploring several future directions for this\nwork. In one potential direction, the new model could be used to explore\ninterventions aimed at reducing political polarization. But the researchers\nsay the model could help better understand systems beyond social groups and\nconnections among friends.\n\n\u201cWe could look at excitatory and inhibitory connections between neurons in the\nbrain or interactions representing different combinations of drugs to treat\ndisease,\u201d Kov\u00e1cs said. \u201cThe social network study was an ideal playground to\nexplore, but our main interest is to go beyond investigating interactions\namong friends and look at other complex networks.\u201d\n\nThe code and data behind the paper, \u201cProper network randomization is key to\nassessing social balance,\u201d are available on Github:\nhttps://github.com/hbj153/signed_null.\n\nFor Journalists: view the news release for media contacts and assets\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks\n\n### Redevelopment of Norris University Center\u2019s East Lawn to begin this summer\n\nApril 5, 2024\n\n### \u2018The Night Watchman\u2019 named next One Book selection\n\nApril 8, 2024\n\n### Six Northwestern faculty named 2024 Guggenheim Fellows\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\n## Related Stories\n\n### Transfer learning paves the way for new disease treatments\n\nMarch 4, 2024\n\n### First supernova detected, confirmed, classified and shared by AI\n\nOctober 13, 2023\n\n### Bursts of star formation explain mysterious brightness at cosmic dawn\n\nOctober 3, 2023\n\nNever miss a story:\n\nGet the latest stories from Northwestern Now sent directly to your inbox.\n\nSubscribe\n\nBack to Top\n\nNorthwestern University\n\n## Media Relations\n\nAddress\n\n1603 Orrington Avenue 2nd Floor Evanston, IL 60201\n\nPhone number\n\n(847) 491-5001\n\nEmail address\n\nnews@northwestern.edu\n\n### Subscribe\n\nGet the latest news delivered to your inbox.\n\nSign Up Now\n\n## Northwestern Resources\n\n  * Building Access\n  * Campus Emergency Information\n  * Careers\n  * Contact Northwestern University\n  * Privacy Statement\n  * Report an Accessibility Issue\n  * University Policies\n\n\u00a9 2024 Northwestern University\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Instagram\n  * YouTube\n  * TikTok\n  * LinkedIn\n  * RSS\n\nDisclaimer\n\n", "frontpage": false}
