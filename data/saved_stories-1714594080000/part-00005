The\nAmerican short hair with calico and Siamese coloring has been a constant\ncompanion and source of emotional support.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been through a bunch of health things and she and I have gone through\nall of that together. And she\u2019s she just has this extra great part about her\npersonality that\u2019s very loving. And she can tell when you don\u2019t feel well,\u201d\nClark said. \u201cAnd she\u2019s just really, really special to me.\u201d\n\nSo when Galena disappeared on April 10, Clark was beside herself.\n\nThey searched the neighborhood, put up flyers and posted notices on Facebook\nlost pet pages in Lehi, Utah.\n\n\u201cNot knowing what had happened to her was pretty excruciating,\u201d Clark said, \u201cI\ncried my eyes out for seven days trying to figure out what had happened.\u201d\nClark also ran through all the worst-case scenarios, wondering if the cat\ncould have gotten out of the house and been nabbed by a predator or run over\nby a vehicle.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nA new declaration in Mexico gives 19 cats roaming the presidential palace food\nand care fur-ever\n\nActivists sue US National Park Service over plan to remove Puerto Rico\u2019s\nfamous stray cats\n\nJill Biden wrote children\u2019s book about her White House cat, Willow, that will\nbe published in June\n\nClark said she received a \u201ctext that changed my life\u201d on April 17, saying that\nGalena\u2019s microchip had been scanned, so Clark knew she had been found\nsomewhere. Soon after, she got a call saying her cat was near Riverside,\nCalifornia, after being found in a box along with steel-toed boots that had\nbeen returned to an Amazon warehouse.\n\nClark\u2019s husband had ordered several pairs of boots, kept one and returned the\nrest in a large box on April 10.\n\n\u201cWe realized that that our sweet kitty must have jumped into that box without\nus knowing,\u201d she said.\n\nAmazon employees knew just who to call when they found the feline \u2014 co-worker\nBrandy Hunter, who rescues cats, Clark said.\n\nHunter took the cat home and to the vet the next day, where the microchip was\nscanned.\n\nClark spoke with Hunter who \u201ccalmed me down and told me that my kitty was OK,\u201d\ndespite having spent six days in a cardboard box without food or water.\n\n\u201cI wanted desperately to be with her,\u201d Clark said. She and her husband flew to\nCalifornia the next day, reunited with Galena at the veterinarian\u2019s office and\nrented a car to drive home.\n\n\u201cWe did what we needed to do because I just adore her,\u201d Clark said.\n\nIt was an intensely emotional week.\n\n\u201cI went from hysterically laughing that she was stuck like that \u2014 we mailed\nour cat \u2014 you know ... just the humor part of that, to hysterically crying all\nwithin like five seconds,\u201d Clark said.\n\nThe family was lucky to get Galena back, Clark said, in part because the\nweather was not harsh during the time the cat was missing, the box was torn at\na seam, allowing her to get more air, and because Hunter who took her to a vet\nand had her scanned for a microchip.\n\nSince word got out, Clark has been sharing her cat\u2019s story, with advice to\nmicrochip your pets and to double-check your Amazon boxes before returning\nthem.\n\nGalena is a quiet cat, Clark said.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t meow,\u201d Clark said. \u201cWe would have loved for her to meow so we knew\nthat she was,\u201d in the box.\n\nby Taboola by Taboola\n\nSuggested For You\n\nJury finds Wisconsin man guilty in killing, sexual assault of 20-month-old\ngirl\n\nUndo\n\nTreppenlift-VergleichAd Content\n\nAdvertisement Rentner in Riesa: So kosten Treppenlifte fast nichtsTreppenlift-\nVergleich:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nUndo\n\nFocus turns to demeanor of girlfriend charged in Boston officer's death on\nsecond day of trial\n\nUndo\n\nA Colorado woman was reported missing on Mother's Day 2020.
