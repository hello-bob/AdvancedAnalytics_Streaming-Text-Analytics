For senior executives, existing noncompetes can remain in force. Existing noncompetes with workers other than senior executives are not enforceable after the effective date.\n\n    * Fewer than 1% of workers are estimated to be senior executives under the final rule.\n    * Specifically, the final rule defines the term \u201csenior executive\u201d to refer to workers earning more than $151,164 who are in a \u201cpolicy-making position.\u201d\n  * The FTC estimates that banning noncompetes will result in:\n\n    * Reduced health care costs: $74-194 billion in reduced spending on physician services over the next decade.\n    * New business formation: 2.7% increase in the rate of new firm formation, resulting in an additional 8,500 new businesses created each year.\n    * Rise in innovation: an average of 17,000-29,000 more patents each year.\n\n      * This reflects an estimated increase of about 3,000 to 5,000 new patents in the first year noncompetes are banned, rising to about 30,000-53,000 in the tenth year.\n      * This represents an estimated increase of 11-19% annually over a ten-year period.\n    * Higher worker earnings: $400-$488 billion in increased wages for workers over the next decade.\n\n      * The average worker\u2019s earnings will rise an estimated extra $524 per year.\n  * Next Steps\n\n    * The final rule will become effective 120 days after publication in the Federal Register.\n    * Once the rule is effective, market participants can report information on a suspected violation of the rule to the Bureau of Competition by emailing noncompete@ftc.gov.\n\nThe regulation's effective date is 120 days after Federal Register publication\n- not after the FTC's public announcement.\n\n## Resources\n\n  * Business and Small Entity Compliance Guide\n  * Estimated Increases in Total Annual and Average Worker Earnings by State\n  * Fact Sheet\n  * Infographic\n\n## Model Notices\n\n  * Arabic\n  * English\n  * Korean\n  * Simplified Chinese\n  * Spanish\n  * Tagalong\n  * Vietnamese\n\n## Final Rule\n\nAs used in this part:\n\nBusiness entity means a partnership, corporation, association, limited\nliability company, or other legal entity, or a division or subsidiary thereof.\n\nEmployment means work for a person.\n\nNon-compete clause means:\n\n(1) A term or condition of employment that prohibits a worker from, penalizes\na worker for, or functions to prevent a worker from:\n\n(i) seeking or accepting work in the United States with a different person\nwhere such work would begin after the conclusion of the employment that\nincludes the term or condition; or\n\n(ii) operating a business in the United States after the conclusion of the\nemployment that includes the term or condition.\n\n(2) For the purposes of this part 910, term or condition of employment\nincludes, but is not limited to, a contractual term or workplace policy,\nwhether written or oral.\n\nOfficer means a president, vice president, secretary, treasurer or principal\nfinancial officer, comptroller or principal accounting officer, and any\nnatural person routinely performing corresponding functions with respect to\nany business entity whether incorporated or unincorporated.\n\nPerson means any natural person, partnership, corporation, association, or\nother legal entity within the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction, including any person\nacting under color or authority of State law.\n\nPolicy-making authority means final authority to make policy decisions that\ncontrol significant aspects of a business entity or common enterprise and does\nnot include authority limited to advising or exerting influence over such\npolicy decisions or having final authority to make policy decisions for only a\nsubsidiary of or affiliate of a common enterprise.\n\nPolicy-making position means a business entity\u2019s president, chief executive\nofficer or the equivalent, any other officer of a business entity who has\npolicy-making authority, or any other natural person who has policy-making\nauthority for the business entity similar to an officer with policy-making\nauthority.
