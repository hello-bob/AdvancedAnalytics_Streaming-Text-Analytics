In that time, I\u2019ve trained a lot\n> of generative models. [...] It\u2019s becoming awfully clear to me that these\n> models are truly approximating their datasets to an incredible degree. [...]\n> What this manifests as is \u2013 trained on the same dataset for long enough,\n> pretty much every model with enough weights and training time converges to\n> the same point. [...] This is a surprising observation! It implies that\n> model behavior is not determined by architecture, hyperparameters, or\n> optimizer choices. It\u2019s determined by your dataset, nothing else.
