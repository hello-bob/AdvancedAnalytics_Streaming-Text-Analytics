Source: Anzu Robotics\n\nWhile drones from SZ DKI Technology Co. arguably dominate the U.S. market for\nenterprise drone applications, Anzu Robotics LLC is preparing to serve\noperators that might be affected by a ban on the Chinese-made systems.\n\nThe DJI Matrice and DJI Mavic products both offer a wide range of sensor and\npayload options suitable for use in applications such as inspection, mapping,\nsurveying, and search and rescue operations. In the past year, DJI has\nincreasingly come under criticism because it is a Chinese state-owned\nbusiness, and many DJI drones are used to inspect and map critical U.S.\ninfrastructure.\n\nNew legislation approved by the House Energy and Commerce Committee on March\n20 is part of ongoing efforts by federal and state governments to limit the\nusage of DJI drones in the U.S. There was unanimous agreement among the\ncommittee members, as both Republicans and Democrats supported the proposed\nrestrictions, citing national security concerns.\n\nThe bills, the Countering CCP Drones Act and the Foreign Adversary\nCommunications Transparency Act (download PDFs), are now under consideration\nin the full U.S. House.\n\n\u201cCongress must use every tool at our disposal to stop communist China\u2019s\nmonopolistic control over the [U.S.] drone market,\u201d stated Rep. Elise Stefanik\n(R-New York), the primary sponsor of the bills cleared by the committee.\n\nHowever, many industry insiders are skeptical of the proposed DJI drone ban,\ndue in part to the heavy lobbying of U.S.-based uncrewed aerial systems (UAS)\nmanufacturers such as Skydio that would like to displace DJI.\n\nSuch companies hope to gain more market share within the U.S. market, as\nautonomous commercial drone applications grow in popularity. In August, 2023,\nSkydio ended all sales of its drones to consumers to focus 100% on the\nenterprise market.\n\nLearn from Agility Robotics, Amazon, Disney, Teradyne and many more.\n\n## What\u2019s the possible impact of a U.S. ban on DJI drones?\n\nA lot of commercial drone operators, including fire departments and other\npublic-safety groups, have said that the Countering CCP Drones bill would make\nit illegal for DJI drones to use U.S. communications infrastructure. This\nisn\u2019t a complete ban, but it would make DJI drones useless in the U.S.,\nespecially for any business, state, or local government that might use a DJI\ndrone, they said.\n\nThe potential approval of the legislation has sent the commercial drone\nindustry into a panic, especially search-and-rescue teams that have heavily\ninvested in DJI drones for their operations.\n\nEnter Austin, Texas-based Anzu Robotics.\n\nThe company recently announced its entrance into the U.S. drone market and the\nlaunch of its new Raptor and Raptor T enterprise drones. CEO Randall Warnas is\na veteran in the drone industry, having worked at Autel and FLiR Systems\nearlier in his career.\n\nWarnas said he recognized the potential impact of a DJI ban in the U.S. and\nsaw an opportunity to fill a real need in the industry.\n\nUsing his network, Warnas reached a licensing deal with DJI to manufacture the\nRaptor drones in Malaysia, using the core design and internal chipset of the\nDJI Mavic 3 platform. He could then import and sell the drones in the U.S.\nunder the Anzu Robotics brand.\n\nThe Mavic 3 Enterprise series drones are not the latest generation of drones\nfrom DJI \u2014 that would be the Mavic 3 Pro \u2014 but the platform is proven and\nliked by many industry professionals today. It is one of the most successful\ngenerations of DJI drones to date, according to Warnas.\n\nThe Raptor drone and remote controller in their signature green color. | Credit: Anzu Robotics\n\n## Aloft software meets country of origin mandate\n\nOn the software side, Warnas signed a deal with U.S.-based Aloft AI (formerly\nKittyhawk) to provide the flight control software on the controller. The Aloft\nsoftware source effectively meets the requirements for U.S.-based ownership\nand control of flight data as defined in the Countering CCP Drones bill. By\nmanufacturing drones in Malaysia, Anzu Robotics meets the requirements for\ncountry of origin.\n\n\u201cAt Aloft, we recognize that our customers have diverse operational needs\nwhich demand that everything they fly must be securely and compliantly\nintegrated into the airspace,\u201d said Jon Hegranes, founder and CEO of Aloft.\n\u201cOur collaboration with Anzu Robotics on the Raptor series extends our\ncommitment to providing versatile, cutting-edge drone solutions that ensure\ntop-tier security and compliance for all stakeholders.\u201d\n\nThe Raptor does not have geofencing or other unofficial flight restrictions.\nAll airspace information is authoritative and authentic, as Aloft is an UAS\nService Supplier (USS) approved by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration\n(FAA).\n\nThis comparison of the Anzu Robotics (left) and DJI Mavic 3 Enterprise (right) drones shows their similarities. | Credit: The Robot Report\n\n## Introducing the Anzu Robotics Raptor\n\nBecause Anzu\u2019s drones are based on the DJI Mavic 3 Enterprise platform, they\nare equipped with a 4/3 CMOS sensor 20 MP wide-angle camera with a 56x hybrid\nzoom camera for 12MP images. Raptor T (for thermal) combines 1/2-inch 48MP and\n12MP cameras with a 640\u00d7512 high-resolution LWIR thermal imaging payload, also\nwith 56x hybrid zoom capabilities.\n\nSimilar to the Mavic 3, the Raptor boasts 45 minutes of flight time, a 9-mile\nrange, and an optional RTK module accessory. Raptor will be backward-\ncompatible with the DJI Intelligent Flight Battery from the DJI Mavic 3 drone.\n\nRaptor is priced at $5,100, while Raptor T will sell for $7,600 in the U.S.\nThis is more expensive than its DJI-badged Mavic cousin, but more competitive\nthan U.S.-made counterparts such as Skydio and BRINC.\n\nAnzu Robotics is targeting enterprise applications with the Raptor, as this is\nnot a consumer platform. The company plans to focus in the coming year on\nbuilding its its sales and partner distribution channels.\n\nIf the proposed legislation is passed and DJI is banned in the U.S., Anzu\nRobotics said it expects that existing DJI distribution partners would\nimmediately move to it.\n\nThe Pilot Institute interviewed Randall Warnas about the company\u2019s strategy\nand plans for the coming year.\n\n#### About The Author\n\n##### Mike Oitzman\n\nMike Oitzman is Senior Editor of WTWH's Robotics Group and founder of the\nMobile Robot Guide.
