Musk acquired\nthe social media company in 2022.\n\nThe SEC cracked down on Musk after he posted tweets in 2018 saying he had\nsecured funding to take Tesla private, which came as a shock to the market and\ninitially sent the company's shares surging. The agency said the tweets were\n\"materially false and misleading\" in violation of securities law.\n\nMusk agreed to settle a civil securities action brought by the SEC. As part of\nthat agreement, he signed off on the social media provision.\n\nIn a separate civil case, a jury last year found that Musk was not liable for\nmisleading investors.\n\n### Recommended\n\nIsrael-Hamas war\n\n### Israel-Hamas warU.S. pushes for Gaza cease-fire, seeing narrow window for\na deal before Israel launches Rafah assault\n\n2024 Election\n\n### 2024 ElectionBiden and Trump supporters sharply divided by the media they\nconsume\n\nNow, Musk is saying that the limits on his speech are unconstitutional and\nsays he was effectively coerced into agreeing to it. His lawyers say in court\npapers that the SEC has waged an \"ongoing campaign\" against Musk.\n\nThe provision \"restricts Mr. Musk\u2019s speech even when truthful and accurate. It\nextends to speech not covered by the securities laws and with no relation to\nthe conduct underlying the SEC\u2019s civil action against Mr. Musk,\" the lawyers\nadded.\n\nThe SEC responded in court papers that Musk had waived his right to bringing\nhis argument when he signed off on the settlement.\n\nLower courts agreed in rejecting Musk's claim.\n\nLawrence Hurley\n\nLawrence Hurley covers the Supreme Court for NBC News.\n\nLora Kolodny, CNBC contributed.\n\n\u00a9 2024 NBC UNIVERSAL\n\nWe and our partners use cookies on this site to improve our service, perform\nanalytics, personalize advertising, measure advertising performance, and\nremember website preferences.
