It\u2019s no secret\nthat the traditional funding model of donations and sponsorships is more than\na little shaky. Coder Radio listeners have heard Chris and I bemoan the plight\nof some of our favorite projects and their founders and contributors who often\nfind it hard to make ends meet while services like Amazon Web Services make a\nmint by leveraging their work; for a concrete example of this, take a look at\nDocker and AWS.\n\nDirect Employment: Increasingly,companies are realizing how valuable open-\nsource contributions are. So, why not hire developers to work on these\nprojects full-time? This would give developers financial stability and help\ncompanies innovate faster. Win-win! Unfortunately, this has seen mixed results\nwith many firms cutting the man-hours they allocate to the actual open-source\nprojects in favor of proprietary ones overtime.\n\nConsulting: Open-source developers have a ton of specialized knowledge that\nbusinesses need. By offering consulting services, developers can make money\nand help companies implement, customize, and troubleshoot open-source\nsoftware. It\u2019s a great way to create a win-win situation for everyone involved\nand it has worked in the past! It\u2019s also failed miserably many many times. We\ncan look at such fallen stars as Cygnus for cautionary examples. Hell, even\nthe venerable Red Hat ended up being acquired by IBM.\n\nBug Bounties: Security is a big deal in the digital age, and open-source\nsoftware is no exception. Bug bounty programs pay people to find and report\nvulnerabilities in software. This is a great way for developers to make some\nextra cash and help improve the security of open-source software. This\nstrategy has the added benefit of playing to most business types\u2019 (love you\nall \ud83d\ude42) deep-seated fear of hackers and the like; to be fair in the shadow of\nthe XZ Utils exploit these fears seem pretty legitimate.\n\nThe open-source movement is at a crossroads, facing the challenge of\nsustainability head-on. By adopting models like direct employment, consulting,\nand bug bounties, we can open up new avenues for funding that ensure\ndevelopers are compensated for their invaluable contributions, but it\u2019s not\ngoing to be enough. The industry is evolving and so must our funding models.\nYes, these three methods make sense if used in tandem, but we\u2019re going to need\nsomething more community based to make sure that all project contributors are\nfairly and equitably compensated for their efforts instead of just letting the\nfew large tech firms treat the community as a pool of free labor; perhaps\nsomething akin to podcast boosts would make sense to distribute rewards within\nindividual teams.
