For other\nuses, see Operation Rubicon (disambiguation).\n\nThe CX-52\n\nOperation Rubicon (German: Operation Rubikon), until the late 1980s called\nOperation Thesaurus, was a secret operation by the West German Federal\nIntelligence Service (BND) and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA),\nlasting from 1970 to 1993 and 2018, respectively, to gather communication\nintelligence of encrypted government communications of other\ncountries.^[1]^[2] This was accomplished through the sale of manipulated\nencryption technology (CX-52) from Swiss-based Crypto AG, which was secretly\nowned and influenced by the two services from 1970 onwards.^[1] In a\ncomprehensive CIA historical account of the operation leaked in early 2020, it\nwas referred to as the \"intelligence coup of the century\" in a Washington Post\narticle.^[1]\n\n## History[edit]\n\nInvolved countries\n\nSpying countries\n\nKnowing countries\n\nCountries spied upon\n\nThe origins of Crypto AG go back to the Swedish engineer Arvid Damm; the\ncompany was founded in Switzerland in 1948 by the Swede Boris Hagelin. Crypto\nAG was considered one of the leading manufacturers of encryption technology.\nThe company supplied to about 130 states; Operation Rubicon is said to have\naffected about 100 states.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, the nuclear powers India and Pakistan as\nwell as the Vatican and several other countries, mostly from the global south,\nused devices from Crypto AG.^[2]^[3] However, the manipulated devices from\nCrypto AG also allowed the United States' National Security Agency (NSA) and\nGerman Federal Intelligence Agency (Bundesnachrichtendienst, BND) to read the\nmilitary and diplomatic communications of allied EU or NATO countries such as\nIreland, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Turkey across the board. According to\nGerman public service media company ZDF, there were repeated disputes between\nthe CIA and BND about this: German intelligence did not want allies to be\nspied on, while the CIA wanted to spy on basically every government.^[2]\n\nAccording to ZDF, the contract for the operation was signed on the German side\nby the then head of the Federal Chancellery and Federal Minister for Special\nTasks, Horst Ehmke.^[4] In this respect, it can be assumed that the Federal\nChancellery, as the superior authority, was informed about the operation. When\nthe BND and CIA began operations in 1970, the two intelligence agencies each\nbecame half owners of Crypto AG. Within Operation Rubikon, Crypto AG was given\nthe code name Minerva. The ownership structure was concealed.^[5] They bought\nCrypto AG because Boris Hagelin retired and they had no confidence in\nHagelin's son Boris Jr. The latter was sales manager for North and South\nAmerica. He died in a car accident the same year. His father had the cause of\nthe accident investigated and did not believe it was an accident. Crypto AG\nprofited externally from Swiss neutrality and the image of the country's\nintegrity.^[2] Through encryption technology sold as secure, but in reality\nmanipulated, messages transmitted could be read by the CIA, NSA and BND\nintelligence agencies involved.\n\nThe Munich-based Siemens AG worked closely with Crypto AG and, among other\nthings, manufactured the teleprinters for them. Siemens provided the\nmanagement of Crypto AG for 20 years and had a five percent share of the\nprofits. Siemens engineers helped develop the application equipment.\n\nAccording to reports by Deutsche Welle (DW), the two owners, BND and CIA,\nshared Crypto AG's profits, which in 1975 amounted to CHF 51 million (about DM\n48.6 million; in 2018, taking inflation into account, the equivalent of \u20ac42.6\nmillion). According to DW, BND employees handed over their share to the CIA in\ncash at secret meetings in underground garages.^[5]\n\nIn 1992, Hans B\u00fchler, a Swiss employee of Crypto AG, was detained in Iran.\nAfter nine and a half months in custody, he was released on January 4, 1994,\non payment of 1.4 billion rial bail (about \u20ac925,000 or CHF 1.5 million), after\noriginally being asked for $1 million.^[6] The amount was paid by the BND, but\nB\u00fchler was fired by his employer shortly after his release. It later emerged\nthat B\u00fchler had not known about the tampered devices and had begun to make\ncritical comments about the operation to the media.^[7] According to CIA\naccounts, the HYDRA affair, the internal code name for what happened to\nB\u00fchler, was \"the most serious security breach in the history of the program\".\n\nIn 1993, the BND sold its shares in Crypto AG for $17 million.^[8] According\nto Bernd Schmidbauer, a former Chancellery Minister under Helmut Kohl, the\nChancellery decided to pull out of the operation because the political risks\nwere now rated much higher after B\u00fchler's arrest. For example, the threat\nsituation for Germany was apparently assessed differently after the end of the\nCold War than in previous years, and relations between the states of Europe\nimproved.^[4] After the U.S. withdrew from the company, Crypto AG was split\ninto two companies in 2018. The new management claimed when asked that it had\nno knowledge of activities prior to 2018.^[9]\n\nOn the part of the BND, the Zentralstelle f\u00fcr das Chiffrierwesen (ZfCh)\napparently played an important role in the execution of Operation Rubicon.\nApparently, it provided the weakened encryption algorithms.^[4] The ZfCh gave\nrise to the Central Office for Information Security (ZSI), which later became\nthe Federal Office for Information Security (BSI). The head of the ZfCh until\n1972, after the start of the operation, was Erich H\u00fcttenhain, later Otto\nLeiberich, who also became the founding president of the BSI.\n\n### Decryption and geopolitical significance[edit]\n\nOn behalf of the German government, the BND received diplomatic and military\nradio traffic from many states that encrypted with Crypto AG equipment. The\nBND was able to read these communications across the board thanks to\nmanipulated encryption procedures.^[10]\n\nAccording to the leaked documents, at times over 40 percent of the NSA's total\nmachine decryption could be traced back to Operation Rubicon, which was\nconsidered an \"irreplaceable resource\". For the BND, the operation was even\nmore important as the centerpiece of cooperation with the Americans, as it\naccounted for 90 percent of reports on diplomatic operations, according to CIA\nfigures.^[1] At the same time, the weakness of the algorithms of the exported\nCrypto AG devices continued to be exploited by the BND well after the\noperation was terminated in 1992, according to media reports. For example,\nItalian traffic was reportedly still being deciphered around 2001.^[4]\n\nThe German and U.S. governments were much better informed about domestic and\ngeopolitical events in many countries than was known until the operation was\nuncovered. This subsequently raised questions about the actions or inaction of\nthe actors involved.\n\n#### Coup in Chile[edit]\n\nIn the United States intervention in Chile, the United States relied on\ndecrypted communications from the government of Salvador Allende.^[11]\n\n#### Negotiations on the Middle East conflict[edit]\n\nIn the course of the 1978 Camp David Accords negotiations, the NSA was able to\nread communications from the Egyptian side and therefore knew their\nnegotiating position. The agreement, negotiated under then U.S. President\nJimmy Carter, resulted in the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty in 1979.\n\n#### Falklands War[edit]\n\nDuring the 1982 Falklands War between Argentina and the United Kingdom, it was\napparently possible to decipher a large part of Argentina's encrypted\ncommunications by the NSA and BND, as weakened Crypto AG devices were also\nused there. The resulting intelligence was made available to the British.^[4]\n\n#### US conflict with Libya[edit]\n\nAfter the attack on the Berlin discotheque La Belle in April 1986, the BND and\nNSA intercepted communications between the Libyan embassy in East Berlin and\nTripoli.^[10] Then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan stated that he had clear\nevidence that dictator Muammar Gaddafi was behind the operation, and his\ncountry could track all Libyan communications. The disclosure of his own\ncapabilities was linked to the need to justify U.S. attacks on the country\n(Operation El Dorado Canyon).\n\n#### U.S. invasion of Panama[edit]\n\nIn 1989, the United States invaded Panama (Operation Just Cause). Through\nOperation Rubicon, U.S. intelligence agencies knew that wanted President\nManuel Noriega was in the Vatican embassy in Panama City.\n\n## Detection[edit]\n\nIn 1995, hot on the heels of the Hans B\u00fchler affair (HYDRA), The Baltimore Sun\nreported for the first time that Crypto AG had been selling manipulated cipher\ndevices until the late 1980s, and made the connections to the NSA and CIA. In\na series of articles, Scott Shane and Tom Bowman questioned the relationship\nbetween Crypto AG and Motorola, showing the minutes of a meeting held at\nMotorola in August 1975. At this meeting, two members of the American\nintelligence community \u2014 Nora Mackabee (NSA) and Herb Frank (CIA) \u2014 had been\npresent.^[12]\n\nIn 1996, Der Spiegel followed suit with a similar story in which they made the\nconnections to the NSA and ZfCh. In its print issue No. 36 (1996), under the\ntitle \"'Wer ist der befugte Vierte?'\" (\"'Who is the Authorized Fourth?'\"), Der\nSpiegel devoted an article to the business practices of Crypto AG.^[13]\n\nThe actual exposure of Operation Rubicon happened in February 2020 through the\njoint research of SRF, ZDF, and the Washington Post. They evaluated a 280-page\nintelligence dossier that proved that the BND and CIA were comprehensively\nbehind Crypto AG. The dossier proves that Crypto AG sold manipulated\nencryption devices to about 130 countries as part of Operation Rubicon. The\ncommunication encrypted with the devices could be read by the services without\nany problems.^[2]^[1] According to Austrian intelligence expert Siegfried\nBeer, such devices were also in use in Austria.\n\nBernd Schmidbauer, Minister of State to the Federal Chancellor under Helmut\nKohl, confirmed the Rubikon operation to ZDF in 2020, claiming that it helped\nmake the world a little \"safer and more peaceful\".^[2]\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\nThrough Operation Rubicon, which lasted for decades, various German and U.S.\ngovernments had extensive detailed knowledge of human rights violations\nworldwide. Argentina's armed forces used Crypto AG technology during\nArgentina's military dictatorship from 1976 to 1983. The junta had thousands\nof regime critics thrown alive into the sea from military planes over the\nAtlantic; around 30,000 people in total fell victim to the dictatorship.\nAlthough the German government under Helmut Schmidt was aware of this through\nthe interception technology of Crypto AG, the Germany national football team\nparticipated in the 1978 World Cup held in Argentina.^[2] It must be noted,\nhowever, that an obvious use of the information obtained would most likely\nhave resulted in the unmasking of the politically highly sensitive operation,\nwhich was extremely important for the intelligence services involved.\n\nResearch by ZDF shows that the weaknesses of the algorithms in the manipulated\ndevices could also have been exploited by opposing intelligence services. In\nthe 1980s, the GDR's Ministry of State Security and the KGB had succeeded in\ndeciphering the encryption of Turkish diplomatic reports throughout, thereby\nreading them. Turkey was also one of the states that purchased encryption\ndevices with weakened keys from, among others, Crypto AG.^[4] Thus, the\nweakened crypto products supplied to Allies ultimately jeopardized the\nsecurity of the Alliance as a whole due to the increased risk of third parties\nskimming the information.\n\n## Investigations[edit]\n\nOn January 15, 2020, the Swiss Federal Council decided to entrust former\nfederal judge Niklaus Oberholzer with an investigation.^[14] On February 13,\n2020, an investigation was also launched by the Parliament's Business Audit\nDelegation (GPDel) under GPDel President Alfred Heer.^[15] The GPDel decided\nto merge Niklaus Oberholzer's Federal Council investigations with theirs, and\nOberholzer continues to work under the auspices of the GPDel. Some\nparliamentarians called for a Parliamentary Investigation Commission (PUK),\nwhich would have more powers. The office of the National Council spoke out\nagainst a PUK for the time being, first the report of the GPDel should be\nwaited for.^[16] The report was published on November 10, 2020. Not published,\nhowever, is the report, which was prepared by Niklaus Oberholzer on behalf of\nthe GPDel. The report reveals, among other things, that the Strategic\nIntelligence Service (SND) knew from 1993 that foreign intelligence services\nwere behind Crypto AG; however, both the Federal Council and the leadership of\nthe intelligence service denied having knowledge of this fact. The GPDel\nsubsequently raised the question of why the Federal Council was not informed \u2013\nor did not want to be informed \u2013 in a matter that endangered Swiss neutrality\nin a massive way.^[17] The Swiss Federal Council was asked to comment on the\nGPDel's remarks and recommendations by June 1, 2021.^[18] During the GPDel's\ninvestigation, it became known that other companies besides Crypto AG were\nselling manipulated cipher devices.^[19]\n\nIn May 2021, it became known that Jean-Philippe Gaudin would end his post as\nhead of the Swiss intelligence service NDB at the end of August 2021, as he\nhad informed the Federal Council too late about the affair and the\nrelationship of trust had been shattered. The GPDel was also responsible for\nthe investigation.^[20]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d ^e \"The CIA secretly bought a company that sold encryption devices across the world.
