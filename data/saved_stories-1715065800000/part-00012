Just days ago, Homeland\nSecurity debuted a new AI Safety and Security Board to set a course towards\nthe \u201csafe and secure development and deployment of AI technology in our\nnation\u2019s critical infrastructure.\u201d While boards and committees are common,\nthis effort is no joke. Here we see the full force of the administration\u2019s\nrolodex. Membership includes OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman, Nvidias\u2019 Jensen Huang,\nAnthropic\u2019s Dario Amodei, Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella; an AI industry who\u2019s who.\n\nThe administration isn\u2019t playing around.\n\nThanks for reading Digital Spirits!

This week, CISA followed up with more,\nissuing its official safety guidelines for critical infrastructure operators.\nLegislation is also in progress. In November, a bipartisan collection of six\nsenators released a bill to regulate certain uses of AI in critical\ninfrastructure. Meanwhile in California, SB 1047 would mandate AI developers\nensure certain AI systems cannot enable infrastructure attacks. Picking up on\nthe energy, OpenAI has even begun messaging AI as the \u201cnext critical\ninfrastructure.\u201d This narrative has force, and industry is leaning in.\n\nThis flurry of action is no surprise. Our most critical systems, including the\ngrid, water, pipelines, etc. often have little room for error, and when\ndisaster strikes the impacts can be profound. Certain systems have to work.\nPerhaps CI represents a well-targeted, lowest common regulatory denominator.\n\nAt least until you look under the hood.\n\nRecently, I published a policy brief exploring the often-unrecognized critical\ninfrastructure reality. This legal category is deeply misunderstood and CI\u2019s\nscope unrecognized. While our most critical systems may be a logical\nregulatory starting point, what\u2019s included defies practicality.\n\nCritical infrastructure doesn\u2019t mean what most think it means. Before\nregulating AI\u2019s use or impact on CI, we should ask: what exactly are we\nregulating?\n\n##\n\nA Critical Look at Critical Infrastructure\n\nTo dig into the CI reality, I\u2019ve pulled a few excerpts from my recent report.\n\nFirst, what does \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d even mean? Under the Patriot Act CI\nis defined as:\n\n> \u201csystems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United\n> States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would\n> have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national\n> public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.\u201d\n\nNote the unboundedness. In the law, there are no examples, formulas or\ncriteria to limit what might count. Complete discretion is in the hands of the\nexecutive. The result? Policy bloat. Today, CI is subdivided into 16\nindustrial sectors \u201cranging from the clearly essential, including energy and\nwater, to the decidedly optional, such as commercial facilities.\u201d\n\nThe spread of these sectors is unwieldy:\n\n> \u201cIn its profile of the chemicals sector...[CISA includes] cosmetics,\n> perfumes, bookbindings, and vehicle paint.\u201d\n\nThe risk of a scratched car, it seems, is a matter of national security.\n\n> \u201cUnder transportation, there are critical systems such as our trains, but\n> also vanpool and rideshare services.\u201d\n\nUber and Lyft are likewise critical.\n\n> \u201cUnder commercial facilities, we find perhaps the biggest sprawl of\n> \u2018optionals,\u2019 including the nation\u2019s 2.1 million office buildings and retail\n> shopping centers as well as the entire hotel, film, broadcast, and casino\n> industries.\u201d\n\nApparently, we can\u2019t risk a day without gambling.\n\nBeyond these examples, there is so, so much more. To distill the overall,\nsprawling picture:\n\n> \u201c[T]he combined GDP of just 3 of these 16 sectors\u2014the chemicals sector (25\n> percent), commercial facilities sector (20 percent), and healthcare sector\n> (17.4 percent)\u2014represent over 50 percent of the total US economy.\u201d\n\nTo emphasize: this is just three sectors. While the government doesn\u2019t record\nGDP figures for each, the total economic spread is likely far higher. The best\nanswer to \u201cWhat is critical infrastructure?\u201d is, it seems, another question:\n\u201cWhat isn\u2019t critical infrastructure?\n\n##\n\nWhy Care?\n\nUnfortunately, this unwieldy scope jeopardizes policy success. Let\u2019s look at a\nfew examples:\n\n####\n\n1\\. CISA\u2019s Safety and Security Guidelines\n\nSprawl stresses prioritization.\n\nGovernment resources will always be limited and when scoping is this broad,\nresults are bound to be watered down. CISA\u2019s new critical infrastructure\nsafety and security guidelines illustrate the challenge. In the AI executive\norder, CISA was tasked to \u201ctranslate the National Institute of Standards and\nTechnology\u2019s AI Risk Management Framework into \u201crelevant safety and security\nguidelines for use by critical infrastructure owners and operators.\u201d A worthy\ntask, yet given scope, an impossible mandate.\n\nThe resulting document is a casualty of breadth. Attempting to appease\ndisparate CI parties, the report reads at the highest of high levels, offering\nneither novelty nor context specificity. The document is generic to a fault.\n\nIn CISA\u2019s own word\u2019s \u201cthe guidelines...are written broadly so they are\napplicable across critical infrastructure sectors, DHS encourages owners and\noperators of critical infrastructure to consider sector-specific and context\nspecific AI risks and mitigations.\u201d Their central guideline: figure it out\nyourself.\n\nThe fault here isn\u2019t on CISA. The organization does essential work, is grossly\nunderfunded, and the mandate\u2019s 180-day time frame made targeted risk\nmanagement and analysis across these sectors impossible. If CI were better\nprioritized, perhaps the agency could have marshalled itself to produce lean,\nmean, and effective guidelines.\n\n####\n\n2\\. California\u2019s AI regulation\n\nAnother potential challenge is overregulation. If any bill either directly\nregulates or implicates CI, overreach is the result.\n\nRight now, California is considering SB1047, 1an expansive bill to regulate AI\nrisk and a perfect illustration of CI\u2019s policy strain. Under the bill, AI\ndevelopers would be required to make a \u201cpositive safety determination,\u201d that\nan AI system doesn\u2019t have a \u201chazardous capability.\u201d This is in part defined as\nthe potential to yield \u201cAt least five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000)\nof damage through cyberattacks on critical infrastructure via a single\nincident or multiple related incidents\u201d2 if used \u201cin a way that would be\nsignificantly more difficult to cause without access to a covered model.\u201d\n\nGiven CI\u2019s scope, this bill risks an unwieldy, unworkable information burden\nfor AI developers. The litany of potential targets under the CI umbrella is so\nvast and so varied that no developer can be expected to reasonably imagine\nevery possible risk. What\u2019s more, the probability of a qualifying incident is\nnot low. In 2017 the hack of Equifax, part of our financial service\u2019s critical\ninfrastructure, yielded $1.4 billion in damages. This triples the bill\u2019s\nthreshold. As for AI\u2019s cyber utility, this tech is quickly augmenting the\ncyberattack chain. Already, OpenAI and Microsoft report threat actors are\nusing AI to generate spear-phishing emails and assist actors with translation.\nOn the cutting edge, voice cloning is enabling multi-million dollar thefts.\nSoon, we may even see AI generate malware as code generation aids malicious\nsoftware.\n\nThe one-two-three punch of these varied AI uses, the likelihood, and the\nunwieldy array of critical infrastructure creates the very real risk that\ndevelopers might be at fault. The possible result: A chilling effect will\ndescend, binding legally-cautious developers.\n\nThe wide net of critical infrastructure puts AI innovation at risk.\n\n##\n\nDoing better\n\nThese examples should hopefully demonstrate that CI represents a poorly tuned\npolicy and regulatory foundation. For those seeking targeted AI safety, it\nundermines state capacity. For those seeking innovation, it risks\noverregulation. No matter the perspective, the current state doesn\u2019t work.\n\nThankfully, we can do better. Here are two potential legislative fixes:\n\n1\\. Get specific: If targeted policy is the goal, directly list those targets.\nIf you want grid regulation, say so. If you want safe pipelines, spell it out.\nThe benefit here is clarity and simplicity. The challenge, however, is future\nproofing and flexibility.\n\n2\\. Build criteria: Another option is to set out a list of criteria to\nflexibly determine what counts. Unlike hard-coding targets, criteria can be\ntechnology agnostic and evolutionary. When a new piece of infrastructure\narises, the list of critical systems can expand and contract in tandem.\n\nBoth options are an improvement and (theoretically) neither should be\ndifficult to legislate. Critical infrastructure isn\u2019t controversial and\nrelated bills regularly receive bipartisan support. Fixing this problem could\nbe easy and will set us up for success. At the very least, policy makers\nshould be clear eyed. This is a big package of industries, and that scope\nshould be respected. This carries real risk, and that risk must be accounted\nin policy.\n\nFor more on this issue please read my recent policy brief: Critical Risks:\nRethinking Critical Infrastructure Policy for Targeted AI Regulation\n\nThanks for reading Digital Spirits!

Among the states inheritance of the federal approach is common if not\nuniversal.\n\n1 Like\n\n1\n\nShare this post\n\n#### A Critical Look at Critical Infrastructure\n\ndigitalspirits.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nIs Synthetic Data the Key to AGI?\n\nThe data wars are just beginning.
