A defence mechanism becomes pathological only when\nits persistent use leads to maladaptive behaviour such that the physical or\nmental health of the individual is adversely affected. Among the purposes of\nego defence mechanisms is to protect the mind/self/ego from anxiety or social\nsanctions or to provide a refuge from a situation with which one cannot\ncurrently cope.^[8]\n\n## Theories and classifications[edit]\n\nIn the first definitive book on defence mechanisms, The Ego and the Mechanisms\nof Defence (1936),^[9] Anna Freud enumerated the ten defence mechanisms that\nappear in the works of her father, Sigmund Freud: repression, regression,\nreaction formation, isolation, undoing, projection, introjection, turning\nagainst one's own person, reversal into the opposite, and sublimation or\ndisplacement.^[10]\n\nSigmund Freud posited that defence mechanisms work by distorting id impulses\ninto acceptable forms, or by unconscious or conscious blockage of these\nimpulses.^[9] Anna Freud considered defense mechanisms as intellectual and\nmotor automatisms of various degrees of complexity, that arose in the process\nof involuntary and voluntary learning.^[11]\n\nAnna Freud introduced the concept of signal anxiety; she stated that it was\n\"not directly a conflicted instinctual tension but a signal occurring in the\nego of an anticipated instinctual tension\".^[9] The signalling function of\nanxiety was thus seen as crucial, and biologically adapted to warn the\norganism of danger or a threat to its equilibrium. The anxiety is felt as an\nincrease in bodily or mental tension, and the signal that the organism\nreceives in this way allows for the possibility of taking defensive action\nregarding the perceived danger.\n\nBoth Freuds studied defence mechanisms, but Anna spent more of her time and\nresearch on five main mechanisms: repression, regression, projection, reaction\nformation, and sublimation. All defence mechanisms are responses to anxiety\nand how the consciousness and unconscious manage the stress of a social\nsituation.^[12]\n\n  * Repression: when a feeling is hidden and forced from the consciousness to the unconscious because it is seen as socially unacceptable\n  * Regression: falling back into an early state of mental/physical development seen as \"less demanding and safer\"^[12]\n  * Projection: possessing a feeling that is deemed as socially unacceptable and instead of facing it, that feeling or \"unconscious urge\" is seen in the actions of other people^[12]\n  * Reaction formation: acting the opposite way that the unconscious instructs a person to behave, \"often exaggerated and obsessive\". For example, if a wife is infatuated with a man who is not her husband, reaction formation may cause her to \u2013 rather than cheat \u2013 become obsessed with showing her husband signs of love and affection.^[12]\n  * Sublimation: seen as the most acceptable of the mechanisms, an expression of anxiety in socially acceptable ways^[12]\n\nOtto F. Kernberg (1967) developed a theory of borderline personality\norganization of which one consequence may be borderline personality disorder.\nHis theory is based on ego psychological object relations theory. Borderline\npersonality organization develops when the child cannot integrate helpful and\nharmful mental objects together. Kernberg views the use of primitive defence\nmechanisms as central to this personality organization. Primitive\npsychological defences are projection, denial, dissociation or splitting and\nthey are called borderline defence mechanisms. Also, devaluation and\nprojective identification are seen as borderline defences.^[13]\n\nIn George Eman Vaillant's (1977) categorization, defences form a continuum\nrelated to their psychoanalytical developmental level.^[14]^[non-primary\nsource needed] They are classified into pathological, immature, neurotic and\n\"mature\" defences.\n\nRobert Plutchik's (1979) theory views defences as derivatives of basic\nemotions, which in turn relate to particular diagnostic structures. According\nto his theory, reaction formation relates to joy (and manic features), denial\nrelates to acceptance (and histrionic features), repression to fear (and\npassivity), regression to surprise (and borderline traits), compensation to\nsadness (and depression), projection to disgust (and paranoia), displacement\nto anger (and hostility) and intellectualization to anticipation (and\nobsessionality).^[15]\n\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) published\nby the American Psychiatric Association (1994) includes a tentative diagnostic\naxis for defence mechanisms.^[16] This classification is largely based on\nVaillant's hierarchical view of defences, but has some modifications. Examples\ninclude: denial, fantasy, rationalization, regression, isolation, projection,\nand displacement.\n\nDifferent theorists have different categorizations and conceptualizations of\ndefence mechanisms. Large reviews of theories of defence mechanisms are\navailable from Paulhus, Fridhandler and Hayes (1997)^[17] and Cramer\n(1991).^[18] The Journal of Personality published a special issue on defence\nmechanisms (1998).^[19]\n\n## Vaillant's categorization[edit]\n\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

(June 2013) (Learn how and\nwhen to remove this template message)  \n---  \n  \nPsychiatrist George Eman Vaillant introduced a four-level classification of\ndefence mechanisms:^[20]^[21] Much of this is derived from his observations\nwhile overseeing the Grant study that began in 1937 and is on-going. In\nmonitoring a group of men from their freshman year at Harvard until their\ndeaths, the purpose of the study was to see longitudinally what psychological\nmechanisms proved to have impact over the course of a lifetime. The hierarchy\nwas seen to correlate well with the capacity to adapt to life. His most\ncomprehensive summary of the on-going study was published in 1977.^[22] The\nfocus of the study is to define mental health rather than disorder.\n\n  * Level I \u2013 pathological defences (psychotic denial, delusional projection)\n  * Level II \u2013 immature defences (fantasy, projection, passive aggression, acting out)\n  * Level III \u2013 neurotic defences (intellectualization, reaction formation, dissociation, displacement, repression)\n  * Level IV \u2013 mature defences (humour, sublimation, suppression, altruism, anticipation)\n\n### Level 1: pathological[edit]\n\nWhen predominant, the mechanisms on this level are almost always severely\npathological. These defences, in conjunction, permit one effectively to\nrearrange external experiences to eliminate the need to cope with reality.\nPathological users of these mechanisms frequently appear irrational or insane\nto others. These are the \"pathological\" defences, common in overt psychosis.\nHowever, they are normally found in dreams and throughout childhood as\nwell.^[23] They include:\n\n  * Delusional projection: Delusions about external reality, usually of a persecutory nature\n  * Denial: Refusal to accept external reality because it is too threatening; arguing against an anxiety-provoking stimulus by stating it does not exist; resolution of emotional conflict and reduction of anxiety by refusing to perceive or consciously acknowledge the more unpleasant aspects of external reality\n  * Distortion: A gross reshaping of external reality to meet internal needs\n\n### Level 2: immature[edit]\n\nThese mechanisms are often present in adults. These mechanisms lessen distress\nand anxiety produced by threatening people or by an uncomfortable reality.\nExcessive use of such defences is seen as socially undesirable, in that they\nare immature, difficult to deal with and seriously out of touch with reality.\nThese are the so-called \"immature\" defences and overuse almost always leads to\nserious problems in a person's ability to cope effectively. These defences are\noften seen in major depression and personality disorders.^[23] They include:\n\n  * Acting out: Direct expression of an unconscious wish or impulse in action, without conscious awareness of the emotion that drives the expressive behavior\n  * Hypochondriasis: An excessive preoccupation or worry about having a serious illness\n  * Passive-aggressive behavior: Indirect expression of hostility\n  * Projection: A primitive form of paranoia. Projection reduces anxiety by allowing the expression of the undesirable impulses or desires without becoming consciously aware of them; attributing one's own unacknowledged, unacceptable, or unwanted thoughts and emotions to another; includes severe prejudice and jealousy, hypervigilance to external danger, and \"injustice collecting\", all with the aim of shifting one's unacceptable thoughts, feelings and impulses onto someone else, such that those same thoughts, feelings, beliefs and motivations are perceived as being possessed by the other.\n  * Schizoid fantasy: Tendency to retreat into fantasy in order to resolve inner and outer conflicts\n  * Splitting: A primitive defence. Both harmful and helpful impulses are split off and segregated, frequently projected onto someone else. The defended individual segregates experiences into all-good and all-bad categories, with no room for ambiguity and ambivalence. When \"splitting\" is combined with \"projecting\", the undesirable qualities that one unconsciously perceives oneself as possessing, one consciously attributes to another.^[24]\n\n### Level 3: neurotic[edit]\n\nThese mechanisms are considered neurotic, but fairly common in adults. Such\ndefences have short-term advantages in coping, but can often cause long-term\nproblems in relationships, work and in enjoying life when used as one's\nprimary style of coping with the world.^[23] They include:\n\n  * Displacement: Defence mechanism that shifts sexual or aggressive impulses to a more acceptable or less threatening target; redirecting emotion to a safer outlet; separation of emotion from its real object and redirection of the intense emotion toward someone or something that is less offensive or threatening in order to avoid dealing directly with what is frightening or threatening.\n  * Dissociation: Temporary drastic modification of one's personal identity or character to avoid emotional distress; separation or postponement of a feeling that normally would accompany a situation or thought.\n  * Intellectualization: Excessively analytical or abstract thought patterns, potentially leading to increased distance from one's emotions. Used to block out conflicting or disturbing feelings or thoughts.^[25]\n  * Isolation of affect: The detachment of emotion from an idea, making it \"flat.\" Frequently observed in obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder, and in non-disordered people following traumatic events.^[26]\n  * Reaction formation: Converting unconscious wishes or impulses that are perceived to be dangerous or unacceptable into their opposites; behaviour that is completely the opposite of what one really wants or feels; taking the opposite belief because the true belief causes anxiety\n  * Repression: The process of attempting to repel desires towards pleasurable instincts, caused by a threat of suffering if the desire is satisfied; the desire is moved to the unconscious in the attempt to prevent it from entering consciousness;^[27] seemingly unexplainable naivety, memory lapse or lack of awareness of one's own situation and condition; the emotion is conscious, but the idea behind it is absent^[28]\n\n### Level 4: mature[edit]\n\nThese are commonly found among emotionally healthy adults and are considered\nmature, even though many have their origins in an immature stage of\ndevelopment. They are conscious processes, adapted through the years in order\nto optimise success in human society and relationships. The use of these\ndefences enhances pleasure and feelings of control. These defences help to\nintegrate conflicting emotions and thoughts, whilst still remaining effective.\nThose who use these mechanisms are usually considered virtuous.^[23] Mature\ndefences include:\n\n  * Altruism: Constructive service to others that brings pleasure and personal satisfaction\n  * Anticipation: Realistic planning for future discomfort\n  * Humour: Overt expression of ideas and feelings (especially those that are unpleasant to focus on or too terrible to talk about directly) that gives pleasure to others. The thoughts retain a portion of their innate distress, but they are \"skirted around\" by witticism, for example, self-deprecation.\n  * Sublimation: Transformation of unhelpful emotions or instincts into healthy actions, behaviours, or emotions; for example, playing a heavy contact sport such as football or rugby can transform aggression into a game^[29]\n  * Suppression: The conscious decision to delay paying attention to a thought, emotion, or need in order to cope with the present reality; making it possible later to access uncomfortable or distressing emotions whilst accepting them\n\n## Other defence mechanisms[edit]\n\nDiagram of selected ego defence mechanisms\n\n### Pathological[edit]\n\n  * Conversion: The expression of an intrapsychic conflict as a physical symptom; examples include blindness, deafness, paralysis, or numbness. This phenomenon is sometimes called hysteria.^[30]\n\n### Immature[edit]\n\n  * Idealization: Tending to perceive another individual as having more desirable qualities than they may actually have.^[31]\n  * Introjection: Identifying with some idea or object so deeply that it becomes a part of that person. For example, introjection occurs when we take on attributes of other people who seem better able to cope with the situation than we do.\n  * Projective identification: The object of projection invokes in that person a version of the thoughts, feelings or behaviours projected.\n  * Somatization: The transformation of uncomfortable feelings towards others into uncomfortable feelings toward oneself: pain, illness, and anxiety.\n  * Wishful thinking: Making decisions according to what might be pleasing to imagine instead of by appealing to evidence, rationality, or reality.\n\n### Neurotic[edit]\n\n  * Isolation: Separation of feelings from ideas and events, for example, describing a murder with graphic details with no emotional response.\n  * Rationalization (making excuses): Convincing oneself that no wrong has been done and that all is or was all right through faulty and false reasoning. An indicator of this defence mechanism can be seen socially as the formulation of convenient excuses.\n  * Regression: Temporary reversion of the ego to an earlier stage of development rather than handling unacceptable impulses in a more adult way, for example, using whining as a method of communicating despite already having acquired the ability to speak with an appropriate level of maturity.^[29]\n  * Undoing: A person tries to 'undo' an unhealthy, destructive or otherwise threatening thought by acting out the reverse of the unacceptable. Involves symbolically nullifying an unacceptable or guilt provoking thought, idea, or feeling by confession or atonement.\n  * Upward and downward social comparisons: A defensive tendency that is used as a means of self-evaluation. Individuals will look to another individual or comparison group who are considered to be worse off in order to dissociate themselves from perceived similarities and to make themselves feel better about themselves or their personal situation.\n  * Withdrawal: Avoidance is a form of defence. It entails removing oneself from events, stimuli, and interactions under the threat of being reminded of painful thoughts and feelings.\n\n## Relation with coping[edit]\n\nSee also: Coping (psychology)\n\nThis section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (August 2016)  \n---  \n  \nThere are many different perspectives on how the construct of defence relates\nto the construct of coping; some writers differentiate the constructs in\nvarious ways, but \"an important literature exists that does not make any\ndifference between the two concepts\".^[32] In at least one of his books,\nGeorge Eman Vaillant stated that he \"will use the terms adaptation,\nresilience, coping, and defense interchangeably\".^[33]\n\nCoping and defense mechanisms have been extensively studied in relation to\nvarious mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, and personality\ndisorders.^[34] Research indicates that these mechanisms often follow specific\npatterns within different disorders, with some, like avoidant coping,\npotentially exacerbating future symptoms.^[35] This aligns with the\nvulnerability-stress psychopathology model, which involves two core\ncomponents: vulnerability (non-adaptive mechanisms and processes) and stress\n(life events).^[36] These factors interact to create a threshold for the\ndevelopment of mental disorders. The types of coping and defense mechanisms\nused can either contribute to vulnerability or act as protective factors.^[37]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Coherence therapy \u00a7 Symptom coherence\n  * Personality disorder \u2013 Maladaptive patterns of behavior\n  * Cognitive dissonance \u2013 Stress from contradictory beliefs\n  * Experiential avoidance \u2013 Attempts to avoid internal experiences\n  * List of cognitive biases \u2013 Systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment\n  * List of maladaptive schemas \u2013 List on psychotherapy topic\n  * Motivated forgetting \u2013 theorized behavior in which people forget unwanted memoriesPages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\n  * Motivated reasoning \u2013 Using emotionally-biased reasoning to produce justifications or make decisions\n  * Narcissistic defences \u2013 Mental processes which preserve the self\n  * Psychological resistance \u2013 Phenomenon in clinical psychology\n  * Self-enhancement \u2013 Type of motivation\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Mariagrazia DG, John CP, Ciro C, Omar CG, Alessandro G (December 2020). \"Defense Mechanisms, Gender, and Adaptiveness in Emerging Personality Disorders in Adolescent Outpatients\".
