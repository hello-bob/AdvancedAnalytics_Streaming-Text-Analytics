The auditorium was one of several\nlandmarks damaged by fires set in the late 1990s. ALL PHOTOS: MATTHEW\nCHRISTOPHER, ABANDONED AMERICA\n\nColumns\n\nSee More\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine how a building as grand as the City Methodist Church in\nGary, Indiana, could ever become abandoned. Completed in 1926, the spectacular\nnine-story complex also included, at one time, a 1,000-seat theater, offices,\na dining hall, and a gymnasium. Built at a cost of over $800,000\u2014equivalent to\nover $14 million today\u2014City Methodist served more than 3,000 congregants at\nits peak before dwindling attendance and lack of funds led to its closure in\n1975. Today, ivy cascades like a waterfall through its broken stained glass\nwindows, the sagging remains of the choir loft clinging desperately to the\nwall.\n\nYou can imagine it as the ruins of an abbey, painted by a famed Romantic\nartist, hanging on the wall of an art museum. But unlike the forlorn chapels\nand cathedrals of the English countryside, popularized in picturesque art from\nthe late 1700s, City Methodist was built less than a century ago. The city\nsurrounding it, also in shambles, isn\u2019t much older. The heavens visible\nthrough City Methodist\u2019s collapsed roof evoke a sense of the timeless and\neternal, in stark contrast to the graffiti adorning the walls and the sounds\nof traffic outside. Gary is a city of modern American ruins created by\ndistinctly contemporary problems, with City Methodist as perhaps the most\niconic and enduring symbol of its loss and, some might argue, its betrayal.\n\nATLAS OBSCURA COURSES\n\nLearn with Us!\n\nCheck out our lineup of courses taught by world-class experts from around the\nworld.

According to an article in USA Today, in 2019\nnearly 20 percent, or roughly 5,700, of the single-family homes in Gary were\nunoccupied. The Chicago Tribune estimated the total number of abandoned\nbuildings in 2015 at nearly 7,000, and that 37 percent of the buildings in the\ncity\u2014more than 12,000\u2014were \u201c\u2018blighted\u2019 and in need of visible repair.\u201d\nCrumbling restaurants, gas stations, apartment buildings\u2014What on Earth\nhappened here? It can feel postapocalyptic, but this is no movie. The economic\ndeprivation that has resulted in nearly a third of Gary\u2019s residents living\nbelow the poverty line, according to the U.S. Census, is a very real horror\nstory.\n\nTo understand the root of Gary\u2019s problems, we have to understand why it was\nbuilt in the first place. Gary was founded in 1906 by United States Steel on\napproximately 10,000 acres of swampland it had covertly purchased. Unlike\nother American cities that had a more organic evolution, Gary\u2019s sole purpose\nwas to manufacture steel at Gary Works. At the time, U.S. Steel was a new\ncompany, birthed in a merger between Andrew Carnegie\u2019s Carnegie Steel Company\nand its rival, Federal Steel, owned by Judge Elbert H. Gary, after whom the\nfreshly minted corporate city was named. Gary was a metropolis born of the\nruthless pragmatism of railway lines and shipping routes\u2014not quality of life.\n\nAn abandoned home in Gary, Indiana.\n\nNew residents flocked to Gary for jobs and architects drew up plans for the\nbuildings where they\u2019d live, work, and worship, but deep and ugly cracks were\nalready forming in the foundation of its fundamental social fabric. The\nIndiana branch of the Ku Klux Klan organized in 1915, bolstered by a deep\nhatred of the immigrants and non-white laborers pursuing work in the state\u2019s\ngrowing industries. In the early 1920s, it was the largest chapter in the\nnation, with 2,000 new members joining weekly. William Seaman, whose tireless\nefforts led to the construction of City Methodist Church, was ousted as its\npastor only two years after its completion due to his opposition to the\nsegregation of church services. The shadow of racism loomed over the city and\nwould haunt it for decades to come.\n\nGary\u2019s population peaked at 178,000 in the 1960s, after which it steadily\ndeclined as white residents and businesses moved to the more affluent\nneighboring town of Merrillville. Though some try to pin blame for the city\u2019s\ndecline on the 1967 election of Gary\u2019s first Black mayor, civil rights\nadvocate Richard Hatcher, it\u2019s clear that he had been handed a city already in\neconomic freefall. The steel industry struggled to keep up with newer mills\noverseas, and by 1959, the United States had become a net importer of steel.\n\nIn 1973, a recession in the global steel market led to drastic decreases in\nsteel prices and mill closures across the country. The effects were severe and\nlong-lasting, and steel towns were among the hardest hit. Cities dependent on\nsteel production\u2014Youngstown, Toledo, Cleveland, what we know today as the Rust\nBelt\u2014were also economically devastated in the 1970s. The loss of residents,\njobs, and tax revenue resulted in crime, poverty, and the dismantling of civic\ninfrastructure. Gary, once famously idealized as the model American town in\nThe Music Man and the birthplace of the Jackson Five, would never recover.\n\nThe exterior of the Palace Theater, once one of Gary\u2019s grandest entertainment\nvenues.The ruined interior of the Palace Theater in Gary, Indiana.\n\nAs U.S. Steel laid off thousands, efforts were made to diversify Gary\u2019s\neconomy. It was too late. Convention centers, hotels, and casinos failed to\ndraw visitors to a city that by 1994 had won the ignominious title of \u201cMurder\nCapital of the United States,\u201d with 91 murders per 100,000 residents,\naccording to the Chicago Tribune. Gary\u2019s descent into gangs, drugs, and\nviolence led to drastic measures, such as a funeral director holding a service\ncalled \u201cThis Could Be You\u201d in a public school, which invited students to look\ninto a coffin with a mirror inside. Gary\u2019s population lost more than 100,000\nresidents. Its schools and libraries, once the pride of the city, shuttered.\nWeeds overtook vacant houses, and in 1997 a series of devastating fires set in\nthe downtown business district destroyed numerous landmarks, including the\nMemorial Auditorium. In a CLTV interview following the fire, Gary resident\nJeri Elliott lamented, \u201cIt\u2019s really a shame to see everything that you grew up\nwith gone.\u201d\n\nThough present-day Gary is sometimes portrayed as little more than a\nplayground for urban explorers, it still has approximately 69,000 residents.\nLike many American cities deeply affected by deindustrialization, it is\nstruggling to rehabilitate its reputation and identity. Ideas such as creating\na theme park celebrating the Jackson Five fell through, and a Los\nAngeles\u2013based tech company reneged on contracts to use the city\u2019s convention\ncenter as a new plant, which would have created thousands of jobs. U.S. Steel,\nwhich had lured tens of thousands of workers to the area, currently only\nemploys around 3,700 at Gary Works, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe ubiquitous derelict buildings are slowly being razed, but without jobs or\nattractions to draw visitors, it is difficult to establish ancillary\nbusinesses such as restaurants and stores. It is hoped that improvements to\nroad and rail lines connecting Gary to nearby cities such as Chicago might\ndraw commuters escaping high rents, and that the Gary/Chicago International\nAirport might serve as a logistics hub for United Parcel Service. But only\ntime will tell.\n\nThe Parry Shaw Building, with overgrowth outside the building.\n\nLong before it was known as a city of ruins or the \u201cMurder Capital of the\nUnited States,\u201d Gary had another nickname: The City of the Century. Depending\non your perspective, this can encapsulate either the optimism or the cynicism\nof early 1900s industrial growth. I\u2019d argue it is emblematic of the shattering\neffects of deindustrialization, as tentpole companies deserted the very people\nwho had created their wealth. Much as we\u2019d like to pretend otherwise, Gary\nisn\u2019t an anomaly\u2014it\u2019s one of the more striking examples of a phenomenon\nobserved across the Rust Belt and beyond. It isn\u2019t a city that is abandoned,\nit\u2019s a city that was abandoned. Cities aren\u2019t just buildings or the companies\nthey were created to support, they\u2019re the people that breathe life into them\nwith their passions and pleasures, their art and music, their dreams. Many of\nthose residents may have left Gary, but we owe the ones who remain our\nsupport, not our derision. Those who have continued to live and create\ncommunity there despite decades of heartache certainly deserve a change in\nfortune. They deserve hope.\n\nOne of the ideas proposed for the former City Methodist Church is to turn it\ninto a \u201cruin garden park,\u201d similar to London\u2019s St. Dunstan-in-the-East church,\nwhich was destroyed during German bombing raids in World War II and later\nconverted into a memorial. As it stands, the Gothic Revival church has been\nused as a filming location for a Transformers movie, A Nightmare on Elm\nStreet, and the series Sense 8, and has drawn tourists and even served as a\nwedding venue.\n\nIn 2022, the Gary Ruins Garden proposal was a finalist in the Knight Cities\nChallenge, an annual competition that supports urban revitalization projects.\nThough it didn\u2019t win the award, it\u2019s an inspired idea that I\u2019d love to see\nrealized. Stabilizing the building so that future generations can appreciate\nthe sublime beauty of its towering columns and breathtaking masonry, in some\nsemblance of its current form, is a tantalizing prospect that I wish was\nexplored for many other endangered landmarks. But that\u2019s not the only reason I\nhope it succeeds. City Methodist isn\u2019t only a relic of Gary\u2019s golden\nyears\u2014it\u2019s a reflection of what the city has endured. It\u2019s a warning, a\nmonument to loss. Maybe one day, opened to a public that appreciates it for\nwhat it is now, overflowing with flowers and life, it can be a symbol of\nrebirth.\n\nSunlight filters in through the collapsed roof of City Methodist Church.A\nproposal to transform the abandoned City Methodist Church into a garden and\nevent space has gained some traction.\n\nIf you want to see more photos or read about the history of Gary, Indiana, you\ncan visit the gallery on Abandoned America or listen to the Abandoned America\npodcast episode about the City of the Century.\n\nMatthew Christopher is a writer and photographer who has explored abandoned\nlocations across the globe for two decades, chronicling the lost landmarks in\nour midst.
