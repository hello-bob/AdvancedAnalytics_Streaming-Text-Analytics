Newly expanded context windows allow us to\n> investigate ICL with hundreds or thousands of examples -- the many-shot\n> regime. Going from few-shot to many-shot, we observe significant performance\n> gains across a wide variety of generative and discriminative tasks. While\n> promising, many-shot ICL can be bottlenecked by the available amount of\n> human-generated examples. To mitigate this limitation, we explore two new\n> settings: Reinforced and Unsupervised ICL. Reinforced ICL uses model-\n> generated chain-of-thought rationales in place of human examples.\n> Unsupervised ICL removes rationales from the prompt altogether, and prompts\n> the model only with domain-specific questions. We find that both Reinforced\n> and Unsupervised ICL can be quite effective in the many-shot regime,\n> particularly on complex reasoning tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that,\n> unlike few-shot learning, many-shot learning is effective at overriding\n> pretraining biases and can learn high-dimensional functions with numerical\n> inputs. Our analysis also reveals the limitations of next-token prediction\n> loss as an indicator of downstream ICL performance.\n\nSubjects:| Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI);\nComputation and Language (cs.CL)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.11018 [cs.LG]  \n(or arXiv:2404.11018v1 [cs.LG] for this version)  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Rishabh Agarwal [view email] [v1] Wed, 17 Apr 2024 02:49:26 UTC (327 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Many-Shot In-Context Learning, by Rishabh\nAgarwal and 11 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.LG\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2024-04\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI cs.CL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\nIArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
