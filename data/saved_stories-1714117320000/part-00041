Now it\u2019s a bureaucracy.\n\nClare Coffey\n\nSubscriber Only\n\nSign in or Subscribe Now for audio version\n\nOn the windowsill above the gas fire sits a surprisingly heavy square box. Its\nback is dirty, thick plastic; its battered and much-dented front is metallic,\nwith rows of tiny ridges and microscopic holes creating a nubby texture if you\nrun your hand across it. A leather strap is buckled into the top for ease of\ncarry, in front of a retractable metal antenna. When the antenna is fully\noutstretched above the squat rectangle, it looks comical. In the top third of\nthe box\u2019s face, a vertical orange needle moves across the rows of numbers\ndenoting frequency scales. You move the needle with a metal knob. There are\nfour knobs in total, and a switch, and a few helpful legends: am/fm, volume,\nand, in neat, raised letters, general electric.\n\nThis is the family radio. It is at least fifty years old. My mother remembers\nher family listening to it after dinner; I remember sitting on the porch,\nhearing the Phillies playing in the background, summer after summer. The other\nnight we turned it on again to catch the first game of the National League\nChampionship Series. A few of the technologically savvy younger generation\nwere home, and at first we tried to get the game on the big-screen Internet-\nenabled TV. Something was wrong with the pirating site, which is a tough\nsituation for appropriately-directed complaint filing. You could get the game\non the MLB app, but the app wants to know your cable provider, which precise\nlack was the reason we were on the app. Hulu was streaming it, apparently. We\ntried to sign up for a free trial that we could cancel before they\u2019d get\naround to billing us. (This is not taking advantage of the free option,\nbecause we would have forgotten to cancel; if anything, Hulu is taking\nadvantage of our rosy-eyed good intentions.) Of course it turned out that\neveryone had already at some point or other created a now-lapsed account; we\nwould have to pay. No problem. We\u2019re big like that. One of us tried to log in.\nNone of us remembered our passwords. The message on the screen directed us to\nvisit some variant of hulu.com/forgotpassword/idiot. We weren\u2019t messing around\nwith that. By now we were fifteen minutes past the start of the game.\n\nRadio it would have to be. But at least we had our Internet-enabled big-screen\nTV speakers. We would listen to Internet radio and pipe the game through the\nwhole downstairs. What was the name of the Philly station? How did the search\nfunction work? How long could painstakingly scrolling to and clicking on each\nrequisite alphanumeric character with the touch-sensitive Apple remote\npossibly take? The answer to none of these questions mattered because, as it\nturned out, three increasingly incredulous searches later, Internet radio had\nnever heard of our local broadcast station.\n\nWe pulled the long spindly antenna all the way up. We flicked the switch to\nFM. We twisted the volume knob as far as it would go. The warm familiar\ncrackle \u2014 then Kyle Schwarber was in our living room, hitting a home run.\n\nThings used to work in this country.\n\nThe General Electric P2940A Clare Coffey\n\nWhen we think of heirlooms, we usually think of objects cast in friendly and\ngraceful materials: wood, wool, crystal, silver. We do not think of\nutilitarian confections of alien plastic. But our GE radio, our unstoppable GE\nradio, is one of our family heirlooms. It\u2019s true that there is something\npleasing about its design. Its amiable proportions and cleanly delineated\nsquares and circles are coupled with a kind of serious banality in color and\ntexture. It has the mystique of telephone wires, of walkie talkies, of legal\npads, of Dana Scully\u2019s suits, of playing \u201cgrownups\u201d as a child: carrying\nbriefcases, writing endless loops that were supposed to be cursive, in a world\nwhere it was and would always be the 1980s. As an object of nostalgia, its\nlook will probably never match the jaunty brightness of the 1950s. But its\nalready substantial following will doubtless continue to grow.\n\n#### Delivered to your inbox:\n\nClear thinking on science and tech\n\nThe GE radio is not a family heirloom for its design features, however. It is\nan heirloom because it has accompanied us through three generations of\nbaseball games and school closure announcements and Saturday morning public\nradio folk hours. And it has accompanied us not because it had any particular\nemotional significance to begin with, but because it just works, and has\nworked, and continues to work. You can take it anywhere, plug it in anywhere.\nIt does one thing perfectly. Well, not perfectly \u2014 it\u2019s probably a little more\nprone to static than it was fifty years ago. The other day, when I turned it\non, it made a noise like a gunshot and started shooting sparks out the back.\nBut here\u2019s the important thing: when the sparks died down, it worked.\n\n#### Humane dissent from technocracy\n\nExhausted by science and tech debates that go nowhere?\n\nWe offer a richer science journalism\n\nI cannot think of a single piece of personal technology that I expect to be\nable to give to my grandchildren in working order. Some cars fit this bill,\nbecause there is an expectation and infrastructure of ongoing repairs. But in\nterms of smaller items? Apple, to give the devil his due, is probably the\nclosest. I ran my iPhone over with a car last year; a quick trip to the\nelectronic repair store and it may last me ten years, if Apple does not\nsabotage me with operating systems updates or charger modifications. But\nthere\u2019s nothing like the GE radio, nothing that I can expect to use, day in\nand day out, for fifty years, without touching it.\n\nThings used to work in this country. This is the stock complaint of the Baby\nBoomers, and if you are lucky enough to inherit a piece of their technology,\nyou may find yourself agreeing. But when I say \u201cthings used to work,\u201d the\nobject of inherited nostalgia is not only manufacturing standards before\nplanned obsolescence and offshoring. Things used to, literally, work. You\nturned a knob, and sound came on, because the knob controlled the mechanism\nthat tuned the radio to the broadcast that the big metal radio towers dotting\nthe landscape beamed at you. I am not a gearhead of any description and don\u2019t\ncare much about how the insides of electrical devices work, but I know exactly\nwhat I, personally, have to do to operate my end of the GE radio. There are no\ndownloads, no platforms, no passwords, no little pull-down menus, no\nverifications or account recovery protocols. There is no streaming. Personal\ntechnology used to be a machine. Now it\u2019s a bureaucracy.\n\nI like simple machines. I do not take \u201csimple enough for a woman to use\u201d to be\na put-down. I take it as a vote of confidence that I will never be enough of a\nnerd (sorry, sorry: high-IQ techno-optimist) to think that syncing the smart\nrefrigerator to the smart TV to the Alexa is a good use of any human being\u2019s\nlimited time on this earth. I like the way simple, sturdy machines unite\ngenerations rather than dividing them \u2014 because they are capable of being\npassed down, because their interfaces are built off broad intuitions about a\nlimited range of actions (turn knob, push button), and because they can be\nmastered via direct experimentation that will not immediately take you down a\nhopeless rabbit hole of arcana and administration.\n\nI like simple machines. But most of all I like the General Electric radio that\nconnects us to the beneficence of public broadcasting, beaming out of the\nsilent towers that stand like guardians of civilization. Trends come and go;\ncutting edges dull; shows get canceled; startups collapse. But our General\nElectric radio remains.\n\n#### Topics\n\n  * The Technological Condition\n  * Manual Competence\n\nLink copied to clipboard!\n\nSubscriber Only\n\nSign in or Subscribe Now for access to PDF downloads\n\nClare Coffey is a writer in Pennsylvania.\n\nClare Coffey, \u201cThings Used to Work in This Country,\u201d The New Atlantis, Number\n75, Winter 2024, pp. 86\u201389.\n\nHeader Image: iStock\n\nEssay\n\nWinter 2024\n\n#### Topics\n\n  * The Technological Condition\n  * Manual Competence\n\nLink copied to clipboard!\n\nSubscriber Only\n\nSign in or Subscribe Now for access to PDF downloads\n\n##### Related\n\nWinter 2023\n\n##### The Joy of Losing Your Phone\n\nApp life has freed us from the kindness of strangers.
