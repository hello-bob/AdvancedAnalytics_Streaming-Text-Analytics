Registration is now open!\nPlease refer to the 2024 page for all the details.\n\nThank you all for the success of the 2023 conference! More than twenty-three\nhundred passionate rendering enthusiasts registered for our two-day event.\n\n# Mission Statement:\n\nWe aim to provide an open and inclusive venue to discuss the \u201cbehind the\nscenes\u201d aspects of rendering that are often key to the success of a product\n(game, platform, movie...) and organisation.\n\nWe use the term \u201carchitecture\u201d to encompass all of the reasoning that leads to\nthe design of a Rendering Engine, from the motivation behind choices made to\nthe code that draws the final image on screen.\n\nFor example:\n\n  * How are the choices behind the technology linked to the product or organisational goals?\n  * Do you share code between projects or build bespoke solutions?\n  * Are custom tools and workflows prioritized, or those following industry standards?\n  * Do you prioritize workflows in favor of creativity, iteration time or run-time performance?\n  * How do art and code collaborate together?\n  * Which battles do you choose to fight, given the resources available?\n  * Practitioners in the field know that these and other similar questions are often more important, and more influential on the end product, than strict reasoning around image quality or performance.\n\nMastery of these aspects is typically relegated to hard won experience of\npeople who had the (mis)fortune of living through many projects.\n\nOur mission is to provide space for this knowledge to be shared in public.\n\n# Program Committee:\n\n  * Steve McAuley, Technical Director, Sony Santa Monica Studio\n  * Angelo Pesce, Sr.Technical Director, Digital Matter @ Roblox\n  * Natalya Tatarchuk, CTO, Activision Publishing\n  * Michael Vance, Fellow Software Engineer, Activision Publishing\n\n", "frontpage": false}
