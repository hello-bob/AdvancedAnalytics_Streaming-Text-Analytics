The Mozilla Foundation's\nlatest research scoped out popular dating apps, and slapped Privacy Not\nIncluded warning labels on 22 of the 25 reviewed.\n\nThe Register sat down with Zo\u00eb MacDonald, Privacy Not Included researcher and\nwriter, to discuss the findings, and you can watch our conversation below.\n\nIn addition to harvesting things like photos and details about your race,\nreligion, political views, sexual preferences, HIV status, and weight \u2013 one-\nquarter of the apps surveyed also collected metadata from users' content. And\nat least one may store video chats, we're told.\n\n\"To be clear, none of the apps are particularly good at privacy,\" MacDonald\nsaid, noting that the team only doled out one \"thumbs up,\" and that went to a\nqueer dating app called Lex.\n\n\"If I had to name one that I thought was the worst, I would have to say Grindr\nbecause they have such an awful history of protecting their users'\ninformation,\" MacDonald said. \"And, of course, it's also an app that is\ntargeting a vulnerable population, which is gay men.\"\n\nGrindr, along with other dating apps used by gay men including Scruff, Growlr,\nand Jack'd, plus OkCupid, were among those sharing users' data with a digital\nadvertising network that then sold this info to a Catholic group. The group\nthen reportedly used this intelligence to out a priest.\n\nIn fact, 80 percent of the dating apps say they may share or sell users'\npersonal information for advertising.\n\nAlso of concern to the folks at Mozilla \u2014 or anyone worried about the\nintersection of privacy and artificial intelligence \u2014 is that half of the\nreviewed dating apps are already using AI, and most of them plan to integrate\nthis tech in the future. Some of these may be used for good or at least be\nuseful, such as Bumble's Deception Detector or an AI-based feature on Tinder\nto help select a profile picture.\n\n\"But privacy wise, AI is a bit of a can of worms,\" MacDonald said. \"Two of the\nmajor players, and two of the groups that we're most concerned about, Grindr\nand Match Group, have both stated their intention to invest in AI in the\nfuture.\"\n\n  * Lawsuit accuses Grindr of illegally sharing users' HIV status\n  * Quarter of polled Americans say they use AI to make them hotter in online dating\n  * Stalkerware usage surging, despite data privacy concerns\n\nMatch, the biggest dating app in the world that owns a ton of other sites\nincluding Tinder, OkCupid, Hinge, and Plenty of Fish, sparked up a\nrelationship with OpenAI shortly after Valentine's Day.\n\nBut considering Match Group's track record, Moz's privacy team says OpenAI\nshould have swiped left.\n\nIn 2022, the US Federal Trade Commission began investigating an alleged data-\nsharing deal between Match Group-owned OkCupid and AI firm Clarifai AI, after\nOkCupid images were reportedly used to train facial recognition software.\n\n\"We don't necessarily trust them to tackle that integration with the kind of\ncare that they would need to, to really ensure that their users' agency is\nrespected and that their privacy is protected,\" MacDonald said. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Mozilla Foundation\n  * Privacy\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Mozilla Foundation\n  * Privacy\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * cookies\n  * Firefox\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * Large Language Model\n  * Machine Learning\n  * MCubed\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NLP\n  * Privacy Sandbox\n  * Star Wars\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Self-driving Car\n\n#### More about\n\n4 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Mozilla Foundation\n  * Privacy\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * Mozilla Foundation\n  * Privacy\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * cookies\n  * Firefox\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * Large Language Model\n  * Machine Learning\n  * MCubed\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NLP\n  * Privacy Sandbox\n  * Star Wars\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Self-driving Car\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### With Run:ai acquisition, Nvidia aims to manage your AI kubes\n\nNow Jensen has a control plane to play with his army of NIMs\n\nAI + ML10 days |\n\n#### Google Search results polluted by buggy AI-written code frustrate coders\n\nAnalysis Pulumi claims it has culled bad infrastructure-as-code samples\n\nAI + ML4 days | 39\n\n#### Forget the AI doom and hype, let's make computers useful\n\nSystems Approach Machine learning has its place, just not in ways that suits\ntoday's hypesters\n\nSoftware10 days | 59\n\n#### Boosting throughput for cloud databases\n\nAiven's bold move to scale up services for Redis users\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Law prof predicts generative AI will die at the hands of watchdogs\n\nVideo Big tech backlash and animus against the machines will invite stifling\nred tape\n\nAI + ML10 days | 21\n\n#### Don't rent out that container ship yet: CIOs and biz buyers view AI PCs\nwith some caution\n\nRisky bet?
