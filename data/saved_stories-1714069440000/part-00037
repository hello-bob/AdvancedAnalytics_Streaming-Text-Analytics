Brodsky, Alexandre Deur & Craig D. Roberts\n\nDeena So'oteh\n\nThe strongest force in the universe is called, aptly, the strong force. We\nnever get to witness its fearsome power because it works only across subatomic\ndistances, where it binds quarks together inside protons and neutrons and\njoins those nucleons into atomic nuclei. Of the four basic forces of nature,\nthe strong force is by far the most potent\u2014it\u2019s 100 trillion trillion trillion\ntimes stronger than the force of gravity. It\u2019s also the most mysterious.\n\nDespite knowing roughly how it compares with the other forces, scientists\ndon\u2019t know precisely how strong the strong force is. The other three\nforces\u2014gravity, the electromagnetic force and the weak nuclear force\n(responsible for some radioactivity)\u2014are much better measured. The strength of\nelectromagnetism, for example, denoted by its \u201ccoupling constant,\u201d has been\nmeasured with the same precision as the distance between New York and Los\nAngeles, to within a few hair breadths. Yet the strong force\u2019s coupling\nconstant, called \u03b1_s (\u201calpha s\u201d), is by far the least understood of these\nquantities. The precision of the best measurements of \u03b1_s is 100 million times\nworse than that of the electromagnetic measurement.\n\nEven this level of (un)certainty is known only in the simplest domain of the\nstrong force theory, at very high energies involved only in some of the rarest\nand most extreme events in nature. At the lower energies relevant to the world\naround us, the strong force earns its name by becoming truly intense, and\nconcrete information on \u03b1_s in this range is scarce. Until recently, no one\nhad made any experimental measurements of \u03b1_s at this scale. Theoretical\npredictions for its value were unhelpful, covering the entire span from zero\nto infinity.\n\nJen Christiansen\n\nThe strong force\u2019s might makes it difficult to study in lots of ways. The\ntheory describing how it works, called quantum chromodynamics, is so\ncomplicated we can\u2019t use it to make direct calculations or precise\npredictions. One of the reasons for this complexity is that the carrier of the\nstrong force\u2014a particle called the gluon\u2014interacts with itself.\nElectromagnetism, in comparison, is simple because its carrier, the photon, is\nchargeless. But the gluon carries the strong force\u2019s version of charge, called\ncolor, and its self-interactions quickly get out of hand. So despite its\nimportance to nuclear physics and building the material world, the strong\nforce is not unconditionally loved by researchers. Instead many look at the\ndomain where the strong force is truly strong as a \u201cTerra Damnata,\u201d a realm to\navoid at all costs.\n\nYet understanding the strong force is essential for explaining the complexity\nof the matter around us. In fact, the strong force accounts for the origin of\naround 99 percent of the mass in the visible universe. (The remaining 1\npercent comes from the Higgs boson.) And now, after half a century of effort,\nscientists have finally begun revealing some of the strong force\u2019s secrets.\nOne of us (Deur) recently made the first measurements of how \u03b1_s changes\nwithin Terra Damnata, and two of us (Brodsky and Roberts) independently\ndeveloped new theoretical predictions that explained the data. Terra Damnata\nis looking more welcoming than ever before. And now that we can explore this\nterrain, we stand to learn much more. We at last have the ability to\nanalytically calculate aspects of quantum chromodynamics from first\nprinciples. Furthermore, exploring this range of the strong force could help\nus understand proposed unifying theories of the universe, as well as the\nquestion of how many dimensions exist in space and time.\n\nMagnets direct particles through the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator\nFacility (CEBAF) at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility.\n\nCourtesy of Jefferson Lab\n\nIf \u03b1_s is a constant, how can it change? The answer has to do with the concept\nof quantum loops, also known as vacuum polarization. Quantum theory revealed\nthat the \u201cvacuum\u201d of space is actually full of tiny particles that are\nconstantly appearing and disappearing in fluctuating clouds. Interactions with\nthese virtual particles can cause a force to depart from its classical\nbehavior because of what\u2019s called a quantum loop. When the notion was first\nintroduced, quantum loops were an unpleasant surprise because they predict\ninfinite quantities\u2014a clear sign that something is wrong. But eventually\nphysicists figured out how to tame these infinities and absorb all the\ncorrections from quantum loops into the equation describing the carrier of the\nforce. Thus, in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), quantum loop corrections affect\nthe gluon\u2019s behavior and determine how much \u03b1_s changes with the distance\nbetween quarks. With this new distance dependence from quantum loops lodged\nwithin the coupling constant, these quantities lost their constancy. So we\u2019ll\njust call them \u201ccouplings\u201d from now on.\n\n## Related Stories\n\n  * ### Peter Higgs, a Giant of Particle Physics, Dies at 94\n\nDavide Castelvecchi & Nature magazine\n\n  * ### How Heavy Is a Neutrino?

For\ninstance, from the tiniest scales ever probed by humans to everyday scales,\n\u03b1_em, the electromagnetic coupling, decreases only by about 10 percent of its\nvalue. For the strong coupling, \u03b1_s, however, the change is huge: even within\nthe domain where physicists are comfortable calculating \u03b1_s (that is, far from\nTerra Damnata), its value changes by several orders of magnitude. Another\ndifference, far more important, is that the electromagnetic coupling decreases\nas the distance grows. For the strong force, however, \u03b1_s increases with\ndistance. If you try to pull two quarks within a proton apart from each other,\nthe attraction between them becomes stronger. In fact, it grows so powerfully\nthat it\u2019s essentially impossible to pry quarks away from each other\u2014the strong\nforce keeps them \u201cconfined,\u201d and you can never find a single quark by itself.\nThe same rule applies to interactions between quarks and gluons and between\ngluons and gluons. The flip side is that these interactions are weak at short\ndistances: the closer you zoom in on a quark, the more loosely it\u2019s bound. The\nsmallness of \u03b1_s at small distances is called asymptotic freedom, and its\ndiscovery in the 1970s eventually won its pioneers the 2004 Nobel Prize in\nPhysics.\n\nJen Christiansen\n\nAt short distances, where \u03b1_s is small, physicists can perform calculations\nusing the same methods that we use for the electromagnetic and weak forces.\nBut these methods don\u2019t work for QCD at longer distances\u2014say, the size of a\nproton. This length is, by everyday standards, still very small (the proton,\nbeing one-50,000th the size of an atom, has a radius of roughly a millionth of\na billionth of a meter). Yet it represents an expanse in particle physics. The\nproblem is that \u03b1_s grows too quickly. Before we can reach a fermi, \u03b1_s\nbecomes too big for the standard calculation method to be applicable. This is\nwhy the (not even very) long-distance domain became Terra Damnata.\n\nJen Christiansen\n\nWith the usual calculation method unavailable, physicists tried other\nstrategies, but they were either less well tested or imprecise and predicted a\nlong-distance limit for \u03b1_s that could lie anywhere between zero and infinity.\nThe usual short-distance calculation method predicts an infinite value of \u03b1_s\nat long range. But this infinity, referred to as the Landau pole after\nphysicist Lev Landau, reveals only that the computational method has failed\nrather than telling us about the strong force. It was crucial to determine\nwhat \u03b1_s does at a distance.\n\nA breakthrough has finally emerged from a wide-ranging effort by many\nphysicists. The tale unfolds in three stages, and one of us played a part in\neach.\n\nThe first step was fortuitous. In the late 1990s Deur was a Ph.D. student\ntaking data at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson\nLab) in Virginia, which houses a particle accelerator. His measurements\nspanned the transition between short distances and Terra Damnata. At the time,\nhe knew of the Landau pole but not that it was bogus. He was puzzled to see\nthat nothing seemed to happen at the distance where \u03b1_s should noticeably\nchange (or so he thought). The data were completely smooth, with no sign of\nthe blowup he had been led to expect. The measurements didn\u2019t seem to bother\nmore experienced scientists, who were accustomed to collecting data in this\nregion, and there are only so many naive questions that students can ask\nbefore exhausting their welcome. So he added this issue to the long list of\nthings that he didn\u2019t understand about the world, to be answered (maybe)\nlater, and moved on.\n\nJen Christiansen\n\nA few years later he used his data and other measurements from Jefferson Lab\nto measure a quantity called the Bjorken integral, named after James Bjorken,\none of the pioneers of strong force studies. The Bjorken integral has to do\nwith the direction of quark spin inside protons and neutrons, and as a bonus,\nit also provides a relatively easy way to calculate \u03b1_s, as long as you stay\naway from Terra Damnata. So Deur was able to measure \u03b1_s on the sure-footed\ndomain of short distances. Being curious and inclined to experiment, he also\nchecked what the formula would predict for long distances. This experiment was\njust for fun, and he knew very well that he wasn\u2019t supposed to take the answer\nseriously. But his analysis showed that, far from drastically changing as the\ndistance grew, \u03b1_s stopped growing and became constant.\n\nDeur shared this alarming finding with his Ph.D. mentor, Jian-Ping Chen, a\nJefferson Lab staff scientist, who remarked that this \u03b1_s looked like\npredictions he\u2019d seen before. Digging into past studies, Deur found other\ninstances of coupling calculations becoming constant at long distances, much\nlike what he saw in his data. Perhaps his playful \u03b1_s calculation revealed the\nstrong force\u2019s genuine behavior after all? It was a stroke of luck because,\nalthough no one had realized it yet, the Bjorken integral is uniquely suited\nfor calculations of \u03b1_s at long distances. Whereas most measurements probe\ninteractions among many quarks (because quarks are never found alone), the\nBjorken integral manages to filter out most of the multiquark processes and\nseparate out effects on individual quarks. It turns out, this calculation of\n\u03b1_s would not have worked with almost any other type of nucleon data.\n\nBecause Deur\u2019s \u03b1_s possibly made sense, he wondered whether he could show it\nat physics conferences without too much risk of ridicule. He worried, though,\nbecause his measurements seemed to contradict the prevailing wisdom that the\nintensity of the strong force would keep growing. But he decided to risk it.\nAs it happened, Brodsky attended one of these conferences and helped Deur put\nthe work on firmer theoretical footing. This meeting was the beginning of a\nfruitful collaboration that continues to this day.\n\nWhile Deur was exploring \u03b1_s experimentally, Brodsky was working with Guy de\nT\u00e9ramond Peralta and Hans G\u00fcnter Dosch to develop a new method to compute QCD\nproperties at long distances. Their strategy uses a mathematical device known\nas holography (often used to study black holes and gravity) to infer how the\nstrong force behaves with large values of \u03b1_s in our four-dimensional\nspacetime (three space dimensions plus one time dimension) using results from\ncalculations for gravity done in five dimensions. (Whether the extra dimension\nthat underlies this method represents actual physics or is simply a\nmathematical tool to simplify the problem, much like the use of imaginary\nnumbers in classical physics, no one knows.) This novel approach to the\nphysics of the strong force, so-called light-front holography, can determine\n\u03b1_s at long distances and predict the interactions that confine quarks and\ngluons within nucleons.\n\nThank you for signing up!\n\nCheck out our other newsletters\n\nBrodsky had long been acquainted with \u03b1_s and knew that attempts to find a\nunified theory of the electromagnetic, weak and strong forces seemed to\nrequire that \u03b1_s become finite at long range. In fact, he expected such an\noutcome because quarks are confined within nucleons, which means quark and\ngluon quantum loops cannot grow larger than the size of the proton. No more\nloops means no more evolution of the coupling. So although Deur\u2019s measurements\nof \u03b1_s did not surprise him, he was delighted to see that it was, in fact,\npossible to measure \u03b1_s at long distances and that the result showed\nconstancy.\n\nBrodsky and de T\u00e9ramond Peralta contacted Deur to discuss how to compute \u03b1_s\nusing their light-front holography method and went on to calculate it. The\nresult, published in 2010, was gratifying: their \u03b1_s matched Deur\u2019s\nexperimental data exquisitely. It was all the more remarkable because the\ncalculation had no adjustable parameter. They neither fiddled with settings\nnor messed with \u201cfudge\u201d factors.\n\nJen Christiansen\n\nOf course, holography is an exciting, novel approach to quantum chromodynamics\n(and quantum gravity), but it\u2019s not the same as using QCD itself. But we know\nthat it at least models QCD very well, suggesting future physicists might be\nable to prove some kind of equivalence between the behavior of gravity and the\nstrong force. Still, to feel comfortable saying we\u2019d truly calculated \u03b1_s at\nlong distances, we needed a QCD-based computation. A natural approach is to\nsolve the theory\u2019s equations of motion, which in QCD describe how all strong\nforce quantities evolve as spacetime changes.\n\nDeur published his first results on \u03b1_s in 2005, almost 20 years ago. At the\ntime, Roberts puzzled over them, asking himself what relevance this coupling\nmeasurement, seemingly associated exclusively with a single QCD process, could\nhave to the theory\u2019s equations of motion. Such equations need a universal\ncoupling that\u2019s the same for all processes. He put this question aside and\nmoved on.\n\nNine years later, during a 2014 meeting that he and colleagues organized at\nthe European Center for Theoretical Studies in Nuclear Physics and Related\nAreas in Trento, Italy, he returned to Deur\u2019s \u03b1_s. Until this point, theorists\nhad employed two parallel strategies to use QCD\u2019s equations of motion to\nunderstand the theory of the strong force. The \u201ctop-down\u201d approach tried to\npredict \u03b1_s through the properties of gluons. The \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach aimed\nto use directly measurable quantities to infer \u03b1_s by comparing predictions\nwith experimental data.\n\nAt that 2014 meeting, a prominent colleague pointed out that the two\napproaches were delivering vastly different results that couldn\u2019t be\nreconciled. That colleague, however, was unaware of recent progress with the\nbottom-up approach that Roberts had made with his collaborator Lei Chang.\nWithin 24 hours, spurred by the challenge, the two had results in hand for the\nbottom-up coupling estimate. They shared them with two leading players in the\ntop-down area who were also at the meeting, Daniele Binosi and Joannis\nPapavassiliou, and together the group established that the top-down and\nbottom-up results for \u03b1_s were mutually compatible. The parallel streams were\nmerged.\n\nNow we were left with a key question: How do we connect Deur\u2019s coupling\nmeasurements and the value we compute using QCD\u2019s equations of motion? If we\ncan do that, then we will have bridged the final gap.\n\nRoberts\u2019s next step was to speak with physicist Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez-Quintero, who\nhad long been working on the top-down approach and had access to results from\ncomputer simulations of QCD. After some back-and-forth brainstorming along\nwith Binosi, Papavassiliou and a new team member, C\u00e9dric Mezrag, the group\narrived at a universal QCD coupling. Amazingly, this result was virtually\nindistinguishable from both Deur\u2019s data and the holography calculation by\nBrodsky and his colleagues. Moreover, like the holography result, the new\nprediction was parameter-free: no nudging or tinkering. That fact meant that\nthe agreement was deeply significant.\n\nJen Christiansen\n\nSince that time, capitalizing on improved information from the top-down,\nbottom-up and simulation approaches, the group has updated its theoretical\nanalysis. The scientists found that, outside Terra Damnata, their coupling and\nDeur\u2019s data agree to better than 1 percent. Furthermore, moving into Terra\nDamnata, they discovered that complex interactions between quarks, which could\nhave upset the connection between these couplings, largely cancel out among\nthemselves because of the physical features of the processes underlying the\nBjorken integral. This was Deur\u2019s stroke of luck: he had serendipitously\nchosen the one process whose coupling is most closely related to the universal\nresult derived from QCD\u2019s equations of motion.\n\nNow, for the first time, we have both compelling data and calculations of \u03b1_s\nthat cover the entire length-scale range, including Terra Damnata, the\npreviously unreachable territory. The key finding is that as the distance\ngrows greater, the coupling stops growing, and the inconstant constant becomes\nconstant once more. This discovery has profound implications.\n\nThe CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer took some of the measurements that\nhelped to define the strong force at a scale never possible before.\n\nCourtesy of Jefferson Lab\n\nFirst, knowing \u03b1_s at all distances is practically important: physicists can\nnow analytically predict numerous quantities that were previously out of\nreach. Most phenomena relating to the strong force in nature, from the deepest\nstructure of the atoms within us to the inner workings of neutron stars, are\ndetermined by the strength of \u03b1_s. Because this coupling is dominated by its\nlong-range behavior, which we now know to be finite rather than infinite, we\nhave opened up a new world of possible calculations.\n\nAt a deeper level, the solutions of QCD\u2019s equations of motion help to reveal\nthe origin of 99 percent of the visible mass in our universe. This mass comes\nfrom atoms, and most of the mass of atoms is in their protons and neutrons\n(electrons are relatively light). But where does proton and neutron mass come\nfrom? The quarks that constitute them also have very little mass of their own.\nBut at the scale of a proton, our revelations about \u03b1_s suggest that quarks\ngather clouds of gluons around them that generate much of the mass of the\nproton. In essence, the powerful binding energy that the strong force exerts\nto bind quarks together contributes almost all of the mass (remember, Albert\nEinstein revealed that energy and mass are two sides of the same coin).\nTherefore, if you weigh 160 pounds, then more than 158 of them come from\nquantum chromodynamics, specifically because of the mechanism that freezes \u03b1_s\ninto a constant. The Higgs boson contributes only the small remainder\u2014the tiny\nmass the quarks and electrons possess on their own.\n\nEven more significantly, the static nature of \u03b1_s at long distances means that\nQCD is the first full quantum field theory that predicts only finite\nquantities. All the other known quantum field theories, including quantum\nelectrodynamics (which describes the electromagnetic force), run into infinite\nLandau poles at very high energies. As such, QCD may lead the way to\nexplaining many phenomena that lie outside our current understanding.\n\nPursuing this line of reasoning, we may learn, for example, whether string\ntheories with 10, 11 or 26 dimensions of spacetime are necessary to make sense\nof our universe or whether, instead, a clear understanding of our solidly\nestablished four spacetime dimensions will turn out to be sufficient. The\nexcitement right now among nuclear and particle physicists is tangible.\n\n### From Our Archives\n\nThe Glue That Binds Us. Rolf Ent, Thomas Ullrich and Raju Venugopalan; May\n2015.
