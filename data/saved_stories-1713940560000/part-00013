Despite the\nfault, Voyager 1 had operated normally throughout, it added.\n\nLaunched in 1977, Voyager 1 was designed with the primary goal of conducting\nclose-up studies of Jupiter and Saturn in a five-year mission. However, its\njourney continued and the spacecraft is now approaching a half-century in\noperation.\n\nVoyager 1 crossed into interstellar space in August 2012, making it the first\nhuman-made object to venture out of the solar system. It is currently\ntravelling at 37,800mph (60,821km/h).\n\n> Hi, it's me. - V1 https://t.co/jgGFBfxIOe\n>\n> \u2014 NASA Voyager (@NASAVoyager) April 22, 2024\n\nThe recent problem was related to one of the spacecraft\u2019s three onboard\ncomputers, which are responsible for packaging the science and engineering\ndata before it is sent to Earth. Unable to repair a broken chip, the JPL team\ndecided to move the corrupted code elsewhere, a tricky job considering the old\ntechnology.\n\nThe computers on Voyager 1 and its sister probe, Voyager 2, have less than 70\nkilobytes of memory in total \u2013 the equivalent of a low-resolution computer\nimage. They use old-fashioned digital tape to record data.\n\nThe fix was transmitted from Earth on 18 April but it took two days to assess\nif it had been successful as a radio signal takes about 22 and a half hours to\nreach Voyager 1 and another 22 and a half hours for a response to come back to\nEarth. \u201cWhen the mission flight team heard back from the spacecraft on 20\nApril, they saw that the modification worked,\u201d JPL said.\n\nAlongside its announcement, JPL posted a photo of members of the Voyager\nflight team cheering and clapping in a conference room after receiving usable\ndata again, with laptops, notebooks and doughnuts on the table in front of\nthem.\n\nThe Retired Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield, who flew two space shuttle\nmissions and acted as commander of the International Space Station, compared\nthe JPL mission to long-distance maintenance on a vintage car.\n\n\u201cImagine a computer chip fails in your 1977 vehicle. Now imagine it\u2019s in\ninterstellar space, 15bn miles away,\u201d Hadfield wrote on X. \u201cNasa\u2019s Voyager\nprobe just got fixed by this team of brilliant software mechanics.\n\nVoyager 1 and 2 have made numerous scientific discoveries, including taking\ndetailed recordings of Saturn and revealing that Jupiter also has rings, as\nwell as active volcanism on one of its moons, Io. The probes later discovered\n23 new moons around the outer planets.\n\n40 years and counting: the team behind Voyager\u2019s space odyssey\n\nRead more\n\nAs their trajectory takes them so far from the sun, the Voyager probes are\nunable to use solar panels, instead converting the heat produced from the\nnatural radioactive decay of plutonium into electricity to power the\nspacecraft\u2019s systems.\n\nNasa hopes to continue to collect data from the two Voyager spacecraft for\nseveral more years but engineers expect the probes will be too far out of\nrange to communicate in about a decade, depending on how much power they can\ngenerate. Voyager 2 is slightly behind its twin and is moving slightly slower.\n\nIn roughly 40,000 years, the probes will pass relatively close, in\nastronomical terms, to two stars. Voyager 1 will come within 1.7 light years\nof a star in the constellation Ursa Minor, while Voyager 2 will come within a\nsimilar distance of a star called Ross 248 in the constellation of Andromeda.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Space\n  * Astronomy\n  * Nasa\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Cosmic cleaners: the scientists scouring English cathedral roofs for space dust\n\n17 Mar 2024\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncomments\n\n  * ### Russia acknowledges continuing air leak from its segment of space station\n\n28 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Uncontrolled European satellite falls to Earth after 30 years in orbit\n\n21 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko sets world record for most time spent in space\n\n4 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### \u2018Old smokers\u2019: astronomers discover giant ancient stars in Milky Way\n\n26 Jan 2024\n\n  * ### Nasa postpones plans to send humans to moon\n\n10 Jan 2024\n\n  * ### What happened to the Peregrine lander and what does it mean for moon missions?\n\n9 Jan 2024\n\n  * ### Peregrine 1 has \u2018no chance\u2019 of landing on moon due to fuel leak\n\n9 Jan 2024\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
