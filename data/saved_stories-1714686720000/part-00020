Many similar processes exist within a BEAM\napplication. At times it makes sense to name them, allowing sending messages\nwithout requiring the knowledge of their process identifier (aka PID). There\nare several benefits to naming processes, these include:\n\n  1. Organised processes: using a descriptive and meaningful name organises the processes in the system. It clarifies the purpose and responsibilities of the process.\n  2. Fault tolerance: when a process is restarted due to a fault it has to share its new PID to all callees. A registered name is a workaround to this. Once the restarted process is re-registered there is no additional action required and messages to the registered process resume uninterrupted.\n  3. Pattern implementation: a Singleton, Coordinator, Mediator or Facade design pattern commonly has one registered process acting as the entry point for the pattern.\n\n## Naming your processes\n\nNaturally, both Elixir and Erlang support this behaviour by registering the\nprocess. One downside with registering is requiring an atom. As a result,\nthere is an unnecessary mapping between atoms and other data structures,\ntypically between strings and atoms.\n\nTo get around this is it a common pattern to perform the registration as a\ntwo-step procedure and manage the associations manually, as shown in below:\n\n    \n    \n    #+begin_src Elixir {:ok, pid} = GenServer.start_link(Worker, [], []) register_name(pid, \"router-thuringia-weimar\") pid = whereis_name(\"router-thuringia-weimar\") GenServer.call(pid, msg) unregister_name(\"router-thuringia-weimar\") #+end_src\n\nFigure 1\n\nNotice the example uses a composite name: built up from equipment type, e.g.\nrouter, state, e.g. Thuringia, and city, e.g. Weimar. Indeed, this pattern is\ntypically used to address composite names and in particular dynamic composite\nnames. This avoids the issue of the lack of atoms garbage collection in the\nBEAM.\n\nAs a frequently observed pattern, both Elixir and Erlang offer a convenient\nmethod to accomplish this while ensuring a consistent process usage pattern.\nIn typical Elixir and Erlang style, this is subtly suggested in the\ndocumentation through a concise, single-paragraph explanation.\n\nIn this write- up, we will demonstrate using built-in generic server options\nto achieve similar behaviour.\n\n## Alternative process registry\n\nAccording to the documentation, we can register a GenServer into an\nalternative process registry using the via directive.\n\nThe registry must provide the following callbacks:\n\nregister_name/2, unregister_name/1, whereis_name/1, and send/2.\n\nAs it happens there are two commonly available applications which satisfy\nthese requirements: gproc and Registry. gproc is an external Erlang library\nwritten by Ulf Wiger, while Registry is a built-in Elixir library.\n\ngproc is an application in its own right, simplifying using it. It only needs\nto be started as part of your system, whereas Registry requires adding the\nRegistry GenServer to your supervision tree.\n\nWe will be using gproc in the examples below to address the needs of both\nErlang and Elixir applications.\n\nTo use gproc we have to add it to the project dependency.\n\nInto Elixir\u2019s mix.exs:\n\n    \n    \n    #+begin_src Elixir defp deps do [ {:gproc, git: \"https://github.com/uwiger/gproc\", tag: \"0.9.1\"} ] end #+end_src\n\nFigure 2\n\nNext, we change the arguments to start_link, call and cast to use the gproc\nalternative registry, as listed below:\n\n    \n    \n    #+begin_src Elixir :noweb yes :tangle worker.ex defmodule Edproc.Worker do use GenServer def start_link(name) do GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, [], name: {:via, :gproc, {:n, :l, name}}) end def call(name, msg) do GenServer.call({:via, :gproc, {:n, :l, name}}, msg) end def cast(name, msg) do GenServer.cast({:via, :gproc, {:n, :l, name}}, msg) end <<worker-gen-server-callbacks>> end #+end_src\n\nFigure 3\n\nAs you can see the only change is using {:via, :gproc, {:n, :l, name}} as part\nof the GenServer name. No additional changes are necessary. Naturally, the\nheavy lifting is performed inside gproc.\n\nThe tuple {:n, :l, name} is specific for gproc and refers to setting up a\n\u201cl:local n:name\u201d registry. See the gproc for additional options.\n\nFinally, let us take a look at some examples.\n\n### Example\n\nIn an Elixir shell:\n\n    \n    \n    #+begin_src Elixir iex(1)> Edproc.Worker.start_link(\"router-thuringia-weimar\") {:ok, #PID<0.155.0>} iex(2)> Edproc.Worker.call(\"router-thuringia-weimar\", \"hello world\") handle_call #PID<0.155.0> hello world :ok iex(4)> Edproc.Worker.start_link({:router, \"thuringia\", \"weimar\"}) {:ok, #PID<0.156.0>} iex(5)> Edproc.Worker.call({:router, \"thuringia\", \"weimar\"}, \"reset-counter\") handle_call #PID<0.156.0> reset-counter :ok #+end_src\n\nFigure 4\n\nAs shown above, it is also possible to use a tuple as a name. Indeed, it is a\ncommon pattern to categorise processes with a tuple reference instead of\nconstructing a delimited string.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe GenServer behaviour offers a convenient way to register a process with an\nalternative registry such as gproc. This registry permits the use of any BEAM\nterm instead of the usual non-garbage collected atom name enhancing the\nability to manage process identifiers dynamically. For Elixir applications,\nusing the built-in Registry module might be a more straightforward and native\nchoice, providing a simple yet powerful means of process registration directly\nintegrated into the Elixir ecosystem.\n\n## Appendix\n\n    \n    \n    #+NAME: worker-gen-server-callbacks #+BEGIN_SRC Elixir @impl true def init(_) do {:ok, []} end @impl true def handle_call(msg, _from, state) do IO.puts(\"handle_call #{inspect(self())} #{msg}\") {:reply, :ok, state} end @impl true def handle_cast(msg, state) do IO.puts(\"handle_cast #{inspect(self())} #{msg}\") {:noreply, state} end #+END_SRC\n\nFigure 5\n\nTee Teoh\n\nTee is a consultant at Erlang Solutions, with experience working on high\nperformance systems written in Erlang and Elixir.
