However, the oddity of AWS service names is low-hanging\nfruit. The true enigma lies in their labyrinthine pricing dimensions.\n\nGone are the days when \u201cinstance hours\u201d and \u201cgigabyte months\u201d were the only\nunits of cloud measurement we had to worry about. Now, we grapple with\nconstructs like \u201cI/O Operations\u201d and \u201cLCUs,\u201d which depend on multiple\ndimensions tied to your choice of Load Balancer. The downside of these obscure\nmetrics is not their complexity per se, but their disconnect from any\nintuitive understanding of application resource consumption. More often than\nnot, the only way to gauge what a workload will cost on AWS is to deploy it,\nlet it run, and then consult your bill. This is hardly sustainable.\n\nAmazon isn\u2019t completely oblivious to this struggle. Earlier this year, they\nlaunched Amazon Aurora I/O Optimized, a variation that eliminates the fee-per-\nmillion-I/O-requests for a modest 30% increase in instance cost. The\nsimplicity in pricing was enough to attract customers like Open Raven, who not\nonly achieved better cost predictability but also enjoyed a 60% reduction in\ntheir expenses.\n\nIn anticipation of the next wave of pricing complexity, I aim to outdo AWS by\ninventing an even more absurd pricing metric: the Terabyte-Pound-Month.\n\nAWS\u2019s lineup includes physical devices like Snowcones, which fit on your desk;\nSnowballs, which fit in your office; Snowmobiles, which fit in your loading\ndock; and Outposts, which fit in your data centers. These offerings come with\na fixed monthly charge, storage capacity, and\u2013since they\u2019re physically\nshipped\u2013a weight. Disregarding the anomaly of the first month\u2019s charges, let\u2019s\nexamine cost through the lens of weight, yielding our new metric: the\nTerabyte-Pound-Month.\n\nOffering| Cost per Terabyte-Pound-Month  \n---|---  \nSnowcone| $4.17  \nSnowball| $0.23  \nSnowmobile| $0.0000735294  \nOutpost Rack (OR-HUZEI16)| $0.90  \n  \nBefore you take these numbers as absolute gospel, please note that they are\nrepresentative configurations; for numbers specific to your exact\nrequirements, please reach out to your AWS Account Team with what is\nguaranteed to be the most surreal request they get all year. Also be sure to\nnote your operating altitude, as these values are normalized for the product\nweights at sea-level.\n\nBy standardizing costs in terms of weight, AWS customers can now more easily\ncalculate their monthly storage cost-to-weight ratio. This new metric will\nundoubtedly make it simpler for customers to plan their infrastructure\u2013even\ndown to ensuring their floors can withstand the hardware they\u2019re deploying.\n\nI\u2019ll see you at re:Invent, where I can\u2019t wait to learn more.\n\nby Corey Quinn\n\nCorey is the Chief Cloud Economist at The Duckbill Group, where he specializes\nin helping companies improve their AWS bills by making them smaller and less\nhorrifying.

Unfortunately, rather\nthan setting those perceptions to rest, AWS\u2019s GenAI extravaganza at re:Invent\n2023 seemed to prove them true. Of the 22 GenAI-related announcements, half of\nthem are still in preview. Many were [...]\n\nRead More about AWS\u2019s (de)Generative AI Blunder\n\n### Generative AI Builds a re:Invent Scavenger Hunt\n\nBy Corey Quinn\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the tl;dr: At this year\u2019s re:Invent, I\u2019m hosting a photo\nscavenger hunt with significant prizes for \u201cmost items found\u201d and \u201cmost\ncreative entry.\u201d Sign up through my webapp at findme.lastweekinaws.com.
