Following is the story of how his company, Digital Research Inc.,\nestablished CP/M as an industry standard and its subsequent loss to a version\nfrom Microsoft that copied the look and feel of the DRI software.\n\n## Early Days\n\nGary Arlen Kildall was born to a family of Scandinavian descent in Seattle,\nWashington, in 1942. His inventive skills flourished in repairing automobiles\nand having fun but suffered in scholastic pursuits. He qualified for admission\nto the University of Washington based on his teaching experience at the\nfamily-owned Kildall Nautical School rather than his high school grades.\n\nDorothy and Gary, circa 1978. Photo: Courtesy Kildall Family\n\nGary entered college and married his high school sweetheart Dorothy McEwen in\n1963. He was one of 20 students accepted into the university's first master's\nprogram in computer science. Here, his mathematical talents were applied to a\nsubject that fascinated him: all-night sessions programming a new Burroughs\ncomputer. To avoid the uncertainty of the draft at the height of the Vietnam\nWar, on graduating with a PhD, he entered a US Navy officer training school\nand was posted to serve as an instructor in computer science at the Naval\nPostgraduate School (NPS) in Monterey, California.\n\nHerrmann Hall, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey. Creative Commons CC0 1.0\nUniversal Public Domain Dedication.\n\nGary remained at NPS as an associate professor after his tour of duty ended in\n1972. He became fascinated with Intel Corporation's first microprocessor chip\nand simulated its operation on the school's IBM mainframe computer. This work\nearned him a consulting relationship with the company to develop PL/M, a high-\nlevel programming language that played a significant role in establishing\nIntel as the dominant supplier of chips for personal computers.\n\nTo design software tools for Intel's second-generation processor, he needed to\nconnect to a new 8\" floppy disk-drive storage unit from Memorex. He wrote code\nfor the necessary interface software that he called CP/M (Control Program for\nMicrocomputers) in a few weeks, but his efforts to build the electronic\nhardware required to transfer the data failed. The project languished for a\nyear. Frustrated, he called electronic engineer John Torode, a college friend\nthen teaching at UC Berkeley, who crafted a \"beautiful rat's nest of\nwirewraps, boards and cables\" for the task.\n\n## This is going to be a \"big thing\"\n\nLate one afternoon in the fall of 1974, together with John Torode, in the\nbackyard workshop of his home at 781 Bayview Avenue, Pacific Grove, Gary\n\"loaded my CP/M program from paper tape to the diskette and 'booted' CP/M from\nthe diskette, and up came the prompt: *.\"\n\n\"This may have been one of the most exciting days of my life, except, of\ncourse, when I visited Niagara Falls,\" he exclaimed. We now have the power of\nan IBM S/370 [mainframe computer] at our fingertips.\" This is going to be a\n\"big thing,\" they told each other and \"retired for the evening to take on the\nsimpler task of emptying a jug of not-so-good red wine ... and speculating on\nthe future of our new software tool.\"\n\nBy successfully booting a computer from a floppy disk drive, they had given\nbirth to an operating system that, together with the microprocessor and the\ndisk drive, would provide one of the key building blocks of the personal\ncomputer revolution. While they knew it was important, neither realized the\nextraordinary impact it would have on their lives and times.\n\n781 Bayview Avenue, Pacific Grove, circa 1974. Photo: Courtesy Kildall Family\n\nAs Intel expressed no interest in CP/M, Gary was free to exploit the program\non his own and sold the first license in 1975. He continued teaching part-time\nat NPS, and in 1976, with his wife Dorothy as cofounder, they established\nIntergalactic Digital Research to pursue commercial opportunities. They\nshortened the company name to Digital Research Inc. (DRI) when it became\navailable.\n\nGlenn Ewing, a former NPS student, approached DRI with the opportunity to\nlicense CP/M for a new family of disk subsystems for fast-growing\nmicrocomputer maker IMSAI Inc. Reluctant to adapt the code for another\ncontroller, Gary worked with Glen Ewing to split out the hardware dependent-\nportions so they could be incorporated into a separate piece of code called\nthe BIOS (Basic Input Output System).\n\nBefore CP/M, computer manufacturers designed their operating systems to work\nonly with their own hardware and peripheral equipment. An IBM OS would only\nwork with IBM computers; a Burroughs OS would only work with Burroughs\ncomputers, etc. Applications had to be written for each computer's specific\nOS. Such \"closed systems\" made it difficult or impossible to mix and match the\nbest pieces of equipment and software applications programs from different\nmanufacturers.\n\nThe BIOS code allowed all Intel and compatible microprocessor-based computers\nfrom other manufacturers to run CP/M on any new hardware. This capability\nstimulated the rise of an independent software industry by expanding the\nmarket's potential size for each product. A single program could run without\nmodification on computers supplied by multiple manufacturers, laying an\nessential foundation for the personal computer revolution.\n\nDRI advertisement from 1978\n\nDorothy and Gary opened their first office at 716 Lighthouse Avenue, Pacific\nGrove, on the upper floor, with a view of Monterey Bay. They sold CP/M disks\nvia mail order and walked to the post office every workday to pick up checks\nresulting from ads placed in industry magazines such as Byte and Dr. Dobbs'\nJournal of Computer Calisthenics and Orthodontia.\n\nA licensing deal with computer manufacturer IMSAI bestowed credibility across\nthe industry. CP/M became accepted as a standard and was offered by most early\npersonal computer vendors, including pioneers Altair, Amstrad, Kaypro, and\nOsborne.\n\nOutside the DRI office at 801 Lighthouse Avenue in November 1980.

By 1980, DRI employed\nmore than 20 people, and Fortune magazine reported that the company generated\nrevenue of $3.5 million, five times the revenue of Microsoft at that time.\nGary also acquired a Piper aircraft that allowed him to fly from Monterey to\nmeet regularly with his customers in Silicon Valley and beyond.\n\nTo accommodate the expanding engineering staff hired to service the hundreds\nof different computer models used by more than a million people worldwide, DRI\npurchased a 1909 American Foursquare-style residence at 734 Lighthouse. Today,\nit houses the offices of the Carmel Pine Cone newspaper.\n\nGary in 734 Lighthouse Avenue. Photo: John Pierce\n\nOne Friday afternoon, Gary called the engineering staff together and announced\nthat he would give them all a raise over the weekend. On Monday, when they\nreturned to work, contractors began raising the building to make room in the\nbasement for a new Digital Equipment Corporation VAX 11/750 computer system.\nAfter several weeks, supported by heavy wooden beams and house jacks, the\nengineers' desks were five feet higher.\n\nBy 1983, DRI's annual sales reached $45 million. The company employed over 500\npeople, including more than 100 engineers, and had expanded into another\nbuilding at 160 Central Avenue, which today houses the Monterey Bay Aquarium's\noffices.\n\n## The IBM PC Effect\n\nIn 1980, IBM established a new business division in Boca Raton, Florida, to\ndevelop a desktop computer for the mass market. To get the IBM PC, as it\nbecame known, to market as quickly as possible, they used commercially\navailable components, including an Intel microprocessor chip. Bill Gates knew\nGary from early discussions about merging their companies and setting up shop\nin Pacific Grove, so when an IBM procurement team visited Microsoft to license\nthe BASIC interpreter program, he referred them to DRI for an operating\nsystem.\n\nGary at Monterey Airport with his Piper Aerostar. Photo: Tom Rolander\n\nWhen the IBM team arrived in Pacific Grove, they met in the morning with\nDorothy and DRI attorney Gerry Davis to agree on the terms of a non-disclosure\nagreement. Gary, who had flown his aircraft to Oakland to meet an important\ncustomer, returned in the afternoon, as scheduled, to discuss technical\nmatters. IBM wished to purchase CP/M outright, whereas DRI sought a per-copy\nroyalty payment in order to protect its existing base of business. The meeting\nended in an impasse over financial terms, but Gary believed they had\nessentially agreed to do business.\n\nKildall tried to renew the negotiations a couple of weeks later. IBM did not\nrespond because, in the meantime, Bill Gates purchased an OS from Seattle\nComputer Products that was written to emulate the look and feel of CP/M. He\nthen sold a one-time, non-exclusive license to IBM, which used the designation\nPC DOS. With great foresight, he retained the right to license the product to\nothers as MS-DOS.\n\nWhen Gary learned of this transaction, he threatened IBM with a lawsuit over\nwhat he believed was an illegal copy of CP/M. IBM responded by agreeing to\nfund DRI to adapt CP/M for the PC and to make both brands of OS available to\ncustomers. With CP/M's reputation and enhanced features, DRI believed\ncustomers would opt for the better product.\n\nIBM announced the PC on August 12, 1981, but with the PC-DOS list price set at\n$40 versus $240 for CP/M, most customers simply chose the former as the lower-\ncost option. Attorney Gerry Davis recalled that \"IBM clearly betrayed the\nimpression they gave Gary and me.\"\n\n## Aftermath\n\nDRI continued to thrive for several years with a multi-tasking operating\nsystem for the IBM PC-XT and a host of new products. The company also\nintroduced operating systems with windowing capability and menu-driven user\ninterfaces years before Apple and Microsoft.\n\nAt its peak, DRI employed over 500 people and opened operations in Asia and\nEurope. However, by the mid-1980s, in the struggle with the juggernaut created\nby the combined efforts of IBM and Microsoft, DRI had lost the basis of its\noperating systems business.\n\nDispirited, Gary, who never relished the responsibility of managing a large\ncompany or displayed the cut-throat business acumen of a Gates, sold the\ncompany to Novell Inc. of Provo, Utah, in 1991. Ultimately, Novell closed the\nCalifornia operation and, in 1996, disposed of the assets to Caldera, Inc.,\nwhich used DRI intellectual property assets to prevail in a lawsuit against\nMicrosoft.\n\nIn other pursuits, Gary founded KnowledgeSet with his friend and DRI VP of\nengineering, Tom Rolander, where they created the first CD-ROM encyclopedia\nfor Grolier.\n\nIn an oral history for the Computer History Museum, Brian Halla, Intel's\ntechnical liaison to DRI, recalls that Gary \"showed me this VAX 11/780 that he\nhad running in his basement, and he was so proud of it, and he said, 'I\nfigured out a way to have a computer generate animation,' and he said, 'Watch\nthis. And he runs a demo of a Coke bottle that starts real slowly and starts\nspinning, and so as maybe several months went by, he lost interest in this,\nand he sold his setup to a little company called Pixar.'\"\n\nKildall continued to innovate after selling DRI. He moved to Austin, Texas,\nwhere he founded Prometheus Light and Sound to explore wireless home\nnetworking technology and participated in charitable work for pediatric AIDS.\n\nGary Kildall died in 1996 at age 52 following an accident in Monterey. His\nashes are buried in Seattle, the hometown he shared with Bill Gates. Dorothy\nMcEwan Kildall purchased the Holman Ranch in Carmel Valley and served on many\ncommunity boards, including the Heritage Society of Pacific Grove. She died in\n2005.\n\n## The Legacy of Gary Kildall\n\nIn 1995, the Software and Information Industry Association presented Gary\nKildall with a posthumous Lifetime Achievement Award, citing eight significant\nareas in which he contributed to the microcomputer industry.\n\nIn an obituary published in the Microprocessor Report in 1994, his friend, the\nlate John Wharton, commented, \"I don't think Gary ever really begrudged Bill\nGates his business success or his personal fortune. ... what I think Gary\nwanted most was to share his excitement and enthusiasm for computers and\ntechnology with others.\"\n\nGary Kildall in 1988 Photo: Copyright Tom O'Neal, Carmel Valley, CA\n\nOn April 25, 2014, the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineering,\n\"The world's largest professional association for the advancement of\ntechnology,\" installed a bronze IEEE Milestone in Electrical Engineering and\nComputing plaque outside the former DRI headquarters at 801 Lighthouse Avenue.\nThe Milestone program honors important events in electrical engineering and\ncomputing. Achievements such as Thomas Edison's electric light bulb, Marconi's\nwireless communications, and Bell Labs' first transistor are recognized with\nplaques in appropriate locations.\n\nThe citation reads: \"Dr. Gary A. Kildall demonstrated the first working\nprototype of CP/M (Control Program for Microcomputers) in Pacific Grove in\n1974. Together with his invention of the BIOS (Basic Input Output System),\nKildall's operating system allowed a microprocessor-based computer to\ncommunicate with a disk drive storage unit and provided an important\nfoundation for the personal computer revolution.\"\n\nIn 2017, US Navy dignitaries, friends, family, and peers gathered to celebrate\nthe dedication of the Gary A. Kildall Conference Room on the Naval\nPostgraduate School campus in Monterey. The ceremony included the installation\nof a duplicate of the IEEE plaque in the conference room.\n\nDespite this wide recognition of his technical accomplishments, Gary's legacy\nremains mired in a tangle of myths and conspiracy theories. The most\npersistent being driven by a 1982 comment attributed to Bill Gates and\npublished in the London Times newspaper that \"Gary was out flying when IBM\ncame to visit, and that's why they did not get the contract.\"\n\nThe former editor of the Times, Harold Evans, atoned for that story in a PBS\ndocumentary and his book They Made America: Two Centuries of Innovators from\nthe Steam Engine to the Search Engine. The subtitle of the chapter on Gary,\n\"He saw the future and made it work. He was the true founder of the personal\ncomputer revolution and the father of PC software,\" offers a sympathetic\ntelling of the life and times of the entrepreneurial genius who helped give\nbirth to the PC operating system 50 years ago this year.\n\n### Additional information at the Computer History Museum\n\nComments in quotes in this article without source attribution are from Gary's\nunpublished draft of Computer Connections: People, Places, and Events in the\nEvolution of the Personal Computer Industry, written in 1993.
