Yes, the\nglobe is heating up. But effects vary depending on where you live for various\nreasons.\n\nFirst, a report from India calls out problems with the criteria used by the\nIndia Meteorological Department (IMD) to issue a heatwave warning: The\ncriteria do NOT consider humidity, only temperature. Anyone who lives in a hot\nclimate or any climate that includes hot summer days knows that humidity can\nmake a huge difference in whether one can stay cool in hot weather. It turns\nout that the IMD criteria fail to recognize that temperatures below what is\nconsidered a heatwave may be just as dangerous to human health when humidity\nis high and even be downright life-threatening. In short, India is already\nexperiencing conditions that at times are at or near the limits of human\nsuvivability.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe vast majority of humans\u2014even with an unlimited supply of water\u2014would\nlikely die after a few hours in conditions that exceed 95 degrees in very high\nhumidity, what is called wet-bulb temperatures because they represent a wet\ntowel around the bulb of a thermometer. This web-bulb temperature is supposed\nto mimic the way that humans cool themselves through perspiration. At very\nhigh humidity, it becomes hard to get perspiration on the skin to evaporate\nwhich is what allows for cooling of the body. It's why a handheld or electric\nfan helps cool the body because it speeds up evaporation.\n\nScientists have previously believed such extreme conditions currently occur\nvery infrequently anywhere on Earth. Recent studies suggest that 40 years ago\nsuch extremes occurred once or twice a year somewhere on the planet. Now\nmodels suggest they are occurring 25 to 30 times per year. Without dramatic\nreductions in greenhouse gases, these extremes will become increasingly\ncommon. \"Such conditions are unbearable without technology like air\nconditioning and make outdoor labor near impossible,\" according to the\nScienceNews article linked above.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA second story this week warns temperatures might go in the opposite direction\nin one area of the globe as a direct result of the warming of the Greenland\nice sheet, increased rainfall attributed to climate change, and dropping\nsalinity in the tropical waters where the Gulf Stream arises.\n\nThe Gulf Stream, also known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation\n(AMOC), moves heat from the tropics, along the U.S. coast, then across the\nAtlantic to the British Isles and turns back and north to Iceland and\nGreenland. There, having lost much of its heat, it turns downward into the\nAtlantic depths to between 6,000 to 9,000 feet and begins a journey back to\nthe equator and along South America.\n\nJust how much heat does the Gulf Stream move? Some 50 times the energy used by\nall of human civilization. This explains why Northern Europe\u2014a branch of the\nAMOC flows toward Scandanavia as well\u2014and Iceland are much warmer than their\nhigh latitudes would suggest. If the energy transfer were to slow dramatically\nor stop, it would almost certainly plunge these areas into a much colder\nclimate regime, one for which they are not currently prepared.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe basic idea was illustrated in an exaggerated way in the film \"The Day\nAfter Tomorrow\". The speed of the transformation from moderate climate into\nfrozen wasteland takes one week in the film. It should be concerning, however,\nthat past collapses of the AMOC have taken place in a decade.\n\nScientists have been tracking the AMOC since 2004 and believe it is slowing.\nWhen researchers discovered in their calculations and modeling that the AMOC\nmight start its next collapse as early as 2025, they couldn't believe it. They\nrechecked the results, and the conclusion was confirmed. Their model suggests\nthat the current could begin collapsing anywhere from 2025 to 2095. (Some\nscientists pointed out the considerable uncertainties in the model, a\nlegitimate criticism. My response: Shall those in the path of potential\ndestruction simply wait and do nothing until the model can be better\nconfirmed? If so, how long should they wait?)\n\nThe range cited above is not that wide even from a human perspective. And, it\nsuggests once again that the catastrophic effects of climate change aren't\nmerely going to be someone else's problem in the distant future. In the coming\ndecades humans could be migrating away from catastrophes which either make\nlife too hot to be bearable...or too cold\u2014both due to climate change.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBy Kurt Cobb by Resource Insight\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\n  * Iran's Attack on Israel Sparks Global Concerns of Escalation\n  * Tesla to Lay Off Over 10% of Global Workforce\n  * Growing Coal Dependency Puts Central Asian Economies at Risk\n\n##### Download The Free Oilprice App Today\n\nBack to homepage\n\nFACEBOOK Twitter GOOGLE+ LINKEDIN REDDIT PRINT\n\nPrevious Post\n\nCentral Asia's Air Quality Among Worst in the World\n\nNext Post\n\nTransit Trade Growth Complicates Pollution Problem in Caucasus\n\n### Kurt Cobb\n\nKurt Cobb is a freelance writer and communications consultant who writes\nfrequently about energy and environment.
