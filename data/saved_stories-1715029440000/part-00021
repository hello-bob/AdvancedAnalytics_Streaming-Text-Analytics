The new system roles introduced\nenable the creation and management of logical volume manager (LVM) snapshots\nfor improved data backup and recovery processes. Additionaly, updates in the\n9.4 release continues to improve performance, scalability, and reliability for\ndevelopers in building and managing applications.\n\nYou can read the full release notes for this version on the wiki: AlmaLinux OS\n9.4 Release Notes.\n\n## Renewing support for upstream deprecated hardware\n\nWith AlmaLinux 9.4 we have also differentiated ourselves by meeting another\nrequest from our community for support with older hardware to help them stay\non updated operating systems.\n\nThe following device drivers were modified to re-add PCI IDs for hardware\ndisabled in upstream:\n\n  * aacraid - Dell PERC2, 2/Si, 3/Si, 3/Di, Adaptec Advanced Raid Products, HP NetRAID-4M, IBM ServeRAID & ICP SCSI\n  * be2iscsi - Emulex OneConnectOpen-iSCSI for BladeEngine 2 and 3 adapters\n  * hpsa - HP Smart Array Controller\n  * lpfc - Emulex LightPulse Fibre Channel SCSI\n  * megaraid_sas - Broadcom MegaRAID SAS\n  * mlx4_core - Mellanox Gen2 and ConnectX-2 adapters\n  * mpt3sas - LSI MPT Fusion SAS 3.0\n  * mptsas - Fusion MPT SAS Host\n  * qla2xxx - QLogic Fibre Channel HBA\n  * qla4xxx - QLogic iSCSI HBA\n\nFor a complete list of hardware support for which was added in this release,\nsee the Extended hardware support section in the 9.4 release notes.\n\nWhile this list is quite comprehensive, we also welcome feedback from all of\nour users! If you use older hardware, does this list cover everything you need\nit to? If not, please share more here on the AlmaLinux Forums: Re-adding\nsupport for older hardware.\n\n## Pitch In\n\nJoin us in the AlmaLinux Community Chat to get any assistance you need and\nhelp others.
