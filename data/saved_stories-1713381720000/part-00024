She then jumped on the mission to return the books to the grade 1 boy in\nChina.\n\nThe video quickly went viral in China and sparked the search for the boy, with\nhashtags such as \"Grade 1 Class 8 Qin Lang\" getting millions of views on\nWeibo, a microblogging site, and Douyin, the name for TikTok in China.\n\nA week after posting the first video, Ms Xu posted another clip claiming that\nshe had got in touch with the boy\u2019s family and returned the books.\n\nAn investigation was launched after the authenticity of the videos was called\ninto question.\n\nThe influencer, who is from the southern city of Hangzhou, has since\napologised and acknowledged posting a fabricated story.\n\nMs Xu said she made up the story due to her \"light legal consciousness\" and\nacknowledged that her actions \"disrupted the internet order and resulted in\nmassive negative influence\".\n\n\"I should clearly know my social responsibilities and should not create some\ncontent just to grab attention,\" she said.\n\n\"I call on my colleagues to learn from my lesson and never fabricate or spread\nfalse content. Let\u2019s work together to maintain a clean and healthy online\nenvironment.\u201d\n\nHangzhou police said they launched an investigation following complaints about\nMs Xu\u2019s viral video. They discovered that Ms Xu and an accomplice had\npurchased the books with the intention of creating the viral video. They have\nboth been slapped with administrative penalties.\n\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Public Security cited Ms Xu\u2019s case as an example of its\ncrackdown on online rumours. It said over 1,500 people have been arrested\nsince December for spreading online rumours and about 10,700 people have been\nhanded administrative punishment.\n\n## Join our commenting forum\n\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see\ntheir replies\n\nComments\n\n### 1/1China bans influencer from social media for fabricating homework story\n\n### China bans influencer from social media for fabricating homework story\n\nThurman Maoyibe\n\nWeibo\n\n### Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference\nlater?
