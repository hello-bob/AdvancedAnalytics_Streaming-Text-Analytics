Back then, stock prices could only be multiples of 1/8.\nTheir small denomination meant that any fluctuation was a large (as a\npercentage) fluctuation in value. Some days I had the worst portfolio, other\ndays I had the best. The competition happened to end on an up-day.\n\nThis was an example of \u201chigh risk, high reward.\u201d Like startups, but more\nrandom. (But are startups less random?)\n\nStartups need luck too, in finding advertisement channels that work, in the\nright mix of features and usability that triggers product/market fit, in\ncultivating a useful social media presence, on employee number one working out\nwell, on a competitor not making a fatal move, on there being enough money in\nthe market, on appropriate pricing, on market forces not shifting the rules of\nthe game, and the list goes on. And that\u2019s after the luck of where and when\nyou were born, the color of your skin, your gender, and that list goes on too.\n\nWhen you put it that way, it\u2019s obvious why startups fail so frequently! They\nneed a lot of success in a lot of areas, which is a lot of \u201cgood luck\u201d to\nstring together.\n\nHow can you reduce this effect, and maybe even turn luck to work in your\nfavor?\n\nsource\n\nThe list above is a bunch of \u201cand\u2019s.\u201d That is, you need a good marketing\nchannel and you need a few killer features and you need great initial\nemployees and you need a healthy market, etc.. \u201cAnd\u201d is bad! It\u2019s bad because\neach one has a probability of success, and you compute the total probability\nof success by multiplying them.\n\nNo matter how optimistic you are about those probabilities, the end product is\na small number. 70% multiplied by itself six times is only 12%; most of these\nthings we\u2019re listing have a probability less than 70%, and there are more than\nsix things that have to go right.\n\nYou can increase the chance that some of those things go right by making\nexplicit choices. For example, you can pick a large, growing, and healthy\nmarket so that the risk that \u201cno one wants to solve this problem\u201d goes to\nzero. You can compete in a niche where incumbents don\u2019t care or cannot move\nquickly. You can hire someone you\u2019ve worked with before, or build something\nsustainable without hiring. You can you generate Love rather than only Utility\nor Coercion to overcome your deficiencies.\n\nHere\u2019s a long list of those things and how to mitigate them.\n\nEven so, there will be plenty of challenges, so we need a second technique for\nboosting probability: Leverage \u201cor\u201d instead of \u201cand.\u201d\n\nConsider marketing channels. You could get your first few hundred customers\nthrough GoogleAds, or Facebook ads, or affiliate sales, or targeted outbound\nsales, or SEO, or guesting on podcasts and newsletters, or partnering with a\nhigh-profile reseller, or great press about your unique brand and message.\nOnly one of these needs to work! So although the probability of success for\neach one of these is low, the probability that something will work is higher.\n\nThis is true of everything from product features to website copy for\nconversions to avenues to exiting the company years from now. The general rule\nis optionality is strength. When there are lots of ways for things to go\nright, that is a strong position even if you haven\u2019t actualized one of those\nways.\n\nThe converse of this is a business that has extra \u201cand\u201d clauses\u2014even more than\nusual. Marketplaces, for example, almost never succeed. When they do succeed,\nthey are often durable and profitable, which makes them a smart bet for a\nVenture Capitalist that can maintain a diversified portfolio of attempts, but\nfor the individual business it\u2019s a tough road. A marketplace has to thrive\nboth with the sellers and the buyers, and it can\u2019t be too expensive to build\nup both sides, and both sides need to realize value, and it must not be\neasier/cheaper/preferable to transact outside the marketplace, ... otherwise\nthe marketplace fails. Also, many marketplaces often only deliver value once\nthey are at scale; so another \u201cand\u201d is that they have to also \u201cscale down\u201d so\nthe first 100 buyers and sellers also see value.\n\nBy accumulating \u201cand\u201d requirements, you are lowering the probability of\nsuccess. By stringing together possible solutions with \u201cor,\u201d you are\nincreasing the number of ways that luck could smile upon you.\n\nSet yourself up for luck!\n\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear https://longform.asmartbear.com/capturing-luck/ \u00a9\n2007-2024 Jason Cohen @asmartbear\n\n\u261e If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! \u261c\n\n##### Subscribe for more, and Thank you for sharing!\n\nCapturing luck with \u201cor\u201d instead of \u201cand\u201d\n\n1 of 1\n\n### Thank you for sharing this article:\n\nNo ads.
