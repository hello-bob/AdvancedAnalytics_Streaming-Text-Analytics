In this post, I'll share my\nexperiences and insights on how this cognitive adaptation has been unfolding.\n\nThe OVERCLOCKING ANALOGY\n\nIn the world of computers, \"overclocking\" refers to pushing a CPU beyond its\ndefault specifications to achieve higher performance. I've found a striking\nparallel between this concept and what I've been experiencing during my\nBimodal Blitz sessions. As I gradually increase the speed of the audiobook, my\nbrain is able to process the information at a faster rate, much like an\noverclocked CPU.\n\nCOGNITIVE ADAPTATION\n\nWhen I start a blitz (reading a book in my target language while listening to\nthe audiobook version at the same time), I begin the audiobook at normal\nspeed. If the narrator's voice seems slow or my mind starts wandering, I speed\nup the audiobook a bit, maybe by 20 percent. At this point, adjusting my\nreading speed to the audio is easy. It feels comfortable. However, after\nincreasing the audiobook speed a few more times, up to 80-100 percent faster\nthan normal, the narrator's voice sounds like hyper-speed babble, and my\nreading has a hard time keeping up.\n\nWith consistent exposure, my cognitive functions have been able to adapt to\nthis increased demand. I notice that as my reading locks back into\nsynchronicity with the audio, the audio seems to slow down. This is likely\nwhen my brain enters a \"flow state,\" where my cognitive processes align snugly\nwith the task at hand, allowing me to comprehend the spoken language more\neffectively at higher speeds.\n\nIn other words, it's when my reading speed synchronizes with the accelerated\nnarration that flow happens. This synchronization leading to flow state\ncontributes to the enhanced clarity and comprehension I experience as I\nprogress through the material.\n\nENHANCED PERCEPTUAL PROCESSING\n\nAnother intriguing aspect of this cognitive \"overclocking\" is the improvement\nin perceptual processing. As my brain becomes attuned to the increased pace,\nit seems to become more adept at parsing speech signals, leading to better\ndiscrimination of phonetic and linguistic elements. The initially garbled\nvoice becomes clearer, and I can discern more enunciation and distinct words.\n\nAlternately, I've also experienced reduced linguistic processing. When I'm\nlistening at a faster pace, my brain processes less linguistic information.\nI'm no longer focusing on individual words or phonemes but rather on the\noverall meaning and structure of the sentence. This reduced linguistic\nprocessing can make the narrator's voice seem slower and more natural, as the\nbrain is no longer working as hard to parse the individual words.\n\nOPTIMIZING LANGUAGE LEARNING\n\nBorrowing again from the overclocking analogy, I believe that this cognitive\nadaptation and synchronization optimizes my language learning process by\nprocessing information more efficiently. Just as overclocking maximizes a\nCPU's efficiency, my brain is dynamically adapting to efficiently process and\ncomprehend the accelerated audiobook, resulting in improved language\nacquisition.\n\nFLUENCY, the FINAL FRONTIER\n\nAs I continue my Bimodal Blitzathon, with 63 Polish books blitzed in 63 days,\nI'm excited to see the other ways I can push my brain's \"overclocking\"\ncapabilities. I'm curious to discover the upper limits of audio and reading\nspeeds that my cognitive processes can handle while still maintaining optimal\ncomprehension and clarity.\n\nSo onwards and upwards, as I continue to blitz my way into Polish reading and\nlistening comprehension. One day at a time, one book at a time.\n\nP.S. A book on how to Bimodal Blitz (tentatively titled \u201cBlitz This Book\u201d)\nwill eventually be released explaining the method in detail.
