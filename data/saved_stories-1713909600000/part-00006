According to\none thought experiment, if I were a smart enough doctor or computer scientist,\nI could put your brain in a vat, hook it up to a bunch of electrodes that\nenable some kind of simulation of the world, and you\u2019d never know the\ndifference. Fed the proper electrical stimulus, your brain would conjure up\nthe exact same experiences as if you were wandering around in the world in\nyour body.\n\nBut is this \u201cbrain a vat\u201d thought experiment right? Is direct experience \u2014\nthat most intimate and immediate sense of life and the world \u2014 really\nreducible to the wiring of neurons? The answer, I believe, is not at all. More\nimportantly, the mistake at the heart of this idea is a primary example of the\ninability of certain philosophical perspectives on science to confront the\ncentrality of human experience in doing science.\n\n## Reducing conscious experience\n\nThe thought experiment is prevalent in modern culture, inspiring numerous\nscience-fiction films and TV shows, like The Matrix (so awesome) to Altered\nCarbon (very cool, but less awesome). It\u2019s also the underpinning of much-\ntalked-about ideas like the simulation hypothesis or Boltzmann Brains. Taken\nas a whole, brains in vats (let\u2019s abbreviate them as BIVs) exemplify a\nparticular metaphysics of science called reductionism, in which everything we\nexperience can be reduced to the activity of lower levels in the hierarchies\nof structure in the physical world. Reductionism plays a big role in The Blind\nSpot: Why Science Cannot Ignore Human Experience, a new book Marcelo Glieser,\nEvan Thompson, and I have just published. In it, reductionism is seen as one\nof a constellation of views through which direct experience gets forgotten as\nthat which makes scientific activity possible. The most dramatic feature of\nBlind Spot\u2019s philosophy is when useful abstractions \u2014 extracted from\nscientific practice \u2014 are substituted as being more real than the rich,\nseamless life-world that is experienced. That\u2019s exactly what happens with\nBIVs.\n\nThere are a number of ways to see how the BIV idea gets things wrong, but\ntoday I am going to draw from a lovely paper that my Blind Spot co-author Evan\nThompson wrote with Diego Cosmelli. It\u2019s called \u201cBrain in a Vat or Body in a\nWorld? Brainbound versus Enactive Views of Experience.\u201d Thompson and Cosmelli\nwant us to take the BIV thought experiment seriously. What would it take to\nactually \u201cenvat\u201d a brain? Any answer to this question \u2014 even one that assumes\nwe had the best technology imaginable \u2014 must wrestle with a thorny problem:\nthe fact that the brain and body are extremely interconnected, perhaps\ninextricably so.\n\n## Designing a BIV\n\nGiven that brains are just one organ in the collection of systems we call an\norganism, we would need to provide our brain with an apparatus that keeps it\nalive and functioning. Your brain would need to be constantly fed various\nsubstances at their exact concentrations \u2014 at the same frequency and in the\nsame brain locations \u2014 to maintain healthy function. So, we would need a\nhighly specific, highly resolved circulator system to deliver the required\nsubstances. Note, however, that these substances are not passively delivered:\nIt is brain activity itself that determines where, when, and how the\ncirculation system should carry out its task. This means our artificial\ncirculatory system must be coupled at the highest resolution to the brain and\nits own activity in self-regulatory loops. As Thompson and Cosmelli put it:\n\u201cOur life-sustaining system must support this intrinsic activity and respond\nto it locally and systemically at any given instant, independent of any\noutside evaluation of the brain\u2019s needs.\u201d\n\nThere is more, however. The brain as a living organ is not just maintained\nfrom the outside, or exogenously. The brain controls motor functions: how our\nbody parts actually move, including our sense organs. So, instead of one-way\ncontrol, there\u2019s a continuous sensorimotor loop: endogenously controlled\nmovement changes how the senses are stimulated, which gives rise to new\nmovement. The brain has to deal not just with what is happening in the outside\nworld but with what is happening as a result of its own intrinsic activity.\nThis activity is highly nonlinear: It\u2019s not a straightforward result of\nwhatever the sensory inputs are, and it all has to be kept within viable\nlimits so it doesn\u2019t disrupt the homeostasis of the healthy, functioning\nbrain.\n\nTaking these and other requirements together, Thompson and Cosmelli conclude\nthat to really envat a brain, you must embody it. Your vat would necessarily\nend up being a substitute body. Note that they aren\u2019t claiming the substitute\nbody has to be flesh and blood. Instead, they demonstrate how the BIV thought\nexperiment undermines itself. Its fundamental idea is that neural circuitry is\nsomehow the minimal condition/structure needed for experience. Instead,\nThompson and Cosmelli demonstrate that being in a body that is itself active\nin the world is the minimal condition/structure necessary for experience. By\nbeginning with the science of brains as living organs in living organisms,\nthey demonstrate one way that the BIV idea undercuts its own logic. In other\nwords, brains may be necessary for experience but they aren\u2019t sufficient. They\nare one part of the holism that is embodiment in a world \u2014 the true \u201cseat\u201d of\nexperience.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve given reasons to think that the body and brain are so dynamically\nentangled in the causation and realization of consciousness as to be\nexplanatorily inseparable,\u201d write Thompson and Cosmelli.\n\nTo close, I want to note that these kinds of arguments are not just an\nacademic philosophical game. There\u2019s a steady drumbeat these days of people\nmaking powerful claims for AI. Some of these claims draw directly from\nphilosophies animating the BIV argument. Understanding exactly where the flaws\nin that argument appear is one step to making sure we don\u2019t end up building a\ndeeply flawed society that rests exactly on those flaws.\n\nTags\n\nhuman bodyneurosciencephilosophy\n\nIn this article\n\nhuman bodyneurosciencephilosophy\n\nRelated\n\nPersonal Growth\n\n7 thought experiments that will make you question everything\n\nFrom \"Thompson's violinist\" to the \"Experience Machine,\" these thought\nexperiments will throw your mind for a loop.\n\nThinking\n\nA revolting thought experiment tests the limits of philosophical exploration\n\nA controversial new philosophy paper tries to bring our moral prejudices to\nheel.
