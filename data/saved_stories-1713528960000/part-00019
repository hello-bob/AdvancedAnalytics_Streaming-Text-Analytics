A drug has solved\nthat problem.\n\nBy Sarah Zhang\n\nIllustration by The Atlantic.

In\ncases like his, the ideal treatment is a transplant. Arias\u2019s cancer-prone\nblood cells needed to be destroyed and replaced with healthy ones taken from\nthe bone marrow or blood of a donor who matched him biologically. Fortunately,\ndoctors found him a match in the volunteer-donor registries\u2014a man in Poland.\nUnfortunately, Arias\u2019s single match in the entire world was no longer\navailable to donate.\n\nIn the past, the road to transplant might have ended here, but a medical\nadvance had dramatically expanded the pool of donors for patients such as\nArias. With the right drug, Arias could now get a transplant from his brother,\na partial match, or, as he ultimately chose, he could join a clinical trial in\nwhich his donor would be a stranger who shared just eight of 10 markers used\nin bone-marrow transplants. Under this looser standard, Arias\u2019s registry\nmatches multiplied from one to more than 200. \u201cIt really is a game changer,\u201d\nsays Steve Devine, the chief medical officer of the nonprofit NMDP, which runs\nthe U.S. donor registry and has led research into the use of mismatched\ndonors. Today, agonizing searches for a matched donor are largely a thing of\nthe past.\n\nThe drug powering this breakthrough is actually very old. Cyclophosphamide was\nfirst developed in the 1950s for chemotherapy. Fifty years later, researchers\nat Johns Hopkins began studying whether it could be repurposed to prevent a\ncommon and sometimes deadly complication of bone-marrow transplants called\ngraft-versus-host disease, where the donor\u2019s white blood cells\u2014which form the\nrecipient\u2019s new immune system\u2014attack the rest of the body as foreign. The\nbigger the mismatch between donor and recipient, the more likely this was to\nhappen. Cyclophosphamide worked stunningly well against graft-versus-host\ndisease: The drug cut rates of acute and severe complications by upwards of 80\npercent.\n\nCyclophosphamide has now enabled more patients than ever to get bone-marrow\ntransplants \u2014more than 7,000 last year, according to NMDP. (Bone-marrow\ntransplant is still used as an umbrella term, though many of these procedures\nnow use cells collected from the blood rather than bone marrow, which can be\ndone without surgery. Both versions are also known, more accurately, as\nhematopoietic or blood stem-cell transplants.) The field has essentially\nsurmounted the problem of matching donors, a major barrier to transplants,\nEphraim Fuchs, an oncologist at Johns Hopkins University, told me. Fuchs\ncouldn\u2019t remember the last time a patient failed to get a blood stem-cell\ntransplant because they couldn\u2019t find a donor.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t obvious that cyclophosphamide would work so well. \u201cI\u2019m just going to\ncome clean,\u201d Devine told me. \u201cBack in 2003 and 2005, I thought it was crazy.\u201d\nDerived from a relative of mustard gas, the drug is known to be highly toxic\nto a variety of blood cells; in fact, doctors had long used it to kill the\ndiseased bone marrow in patients before transplant. Why would you want to give\nsuch a drug after transplant, when the new donor cells are still precious and\nfew? It defied a certain logic.\n\nBut as far back as the 1960s, researchers also noticed that high doses of\npost-transplant cyclophosphamide could prevent graft-versus-host disease in\nmice, even if they did not know why. Over the next few decades, scientists\nworking away in labs learned that cyclophosphamide isn\u2019t quite carpet-bombing\nthe blood. It actually spares the stem cells most important to successful\ntransplant. (Blood stem cells differentiate into all the types of red and\nwhite blood cells that a patient will need.) Why cyclophosphamide works so\nwell against graft-versus-host disease is still unclear, but the drug also\nseems to selectively kill white blood cells active in the disease while\nsparing those that quell the immune system.\n\nBy the late \u201990s, doctors saw a clear need to expand the search for donors.\nBone-marrow transplants are most successful when donor and recipient share the\nsame markers, known as HLA, which are protein tags our cells use to\ndistinguish self from nonself. We inherit HLA markers from our parents, so\nsiblings have about a one-in-four chance of being perfectly matched. As\nfamilies got smaller in the 20th century, though, the likelihood of a sibling\nmatch fell. Donor registries such as NMDP were created to fill the gap,\nhowever imperfectly.\n\nDoctors soon began coalescing around the idea of using family members who were\nonly haploidentical, or half matched, meaning they shared at least five out of\n10 HLA markers. Every child is a half match to their parents, and every parent\nto their child; siblings also have a 50 percent chance of being half matches.\nBut when doctors first tried these transplants, the \u201coutcomes were horrible,\u201d\nLeo Luznik, an oncologist at Johns Hopkins, told me. Patients had\nfrighteningly high rates of graft-versus-host disease, and more than half died\nwithin three years.\n\nBased on the lab findings, Luznik, Fuchs, and other colleagues at Johns\nHopkins wondered if post-transplant cyclophosphamide could help. The\npharmaceutical companies that made it were uninterested in funding any\nresearch, Luznik said, because \u201cit was an old, very cheap drug.\" With\ngovernment grants, however, the team was able to prove that cyclophosphamide\ngot the rate of graft-versus-disease as low as in matched sibling transplants.\nBy the late 2000s, transplants with half-matched family members were becoming\nroutine.\n\nStill, not every patient will have a sibling or parent or child who can\ndonate. Doctors began wondering if cyclophosphamide could work for unrelated\ndonors too. If only eight of the 10 markers have to be matched, then almost\neveryone would find a donor, even multiple donors. This was especially\nimportant for patients of mixed or non-European ancestry, who have a harder\ntime finding unrelated donors, because people of those backgrounds make up a\nsmaller proportion of registry donors and because they can carry a more\ndiverse set of HLA markers. Two-thirds of white people can find a fully\nmatched registry donor, but that number drops to 23 percent for Black\nAmericans and 41 percent for Asians or Pacific Islanders.\n\nAmelia Johnson, who is half Indian and half Black, was one of the first\nchildren to get a transplant from a mismatched unrelated donor in a clinical\ntrial in 2022. Her mom, Salome Sookdieopersad, remembers being told, \u201cYou guys\nneed to start recruiting bone-marrow donors to help increase your chances.\u201d\nWhen that still didn\u2019t turn up an ideal match, Sookdieopersad prepared to\ndonate to her daughter as a half match. But then Amelia was offered a spot in\nthe clinical trial, and they decided to take it. Transplants with mismatched\nunrelated donors had already been tried in adults\u2014that was Arias\u2019s trial\u2014and\nthey offered other potential benefits. A younger donor, for example, has\nyounger cells, which fare noticeably better than older ones. Amelia did end up\nwith a bout of graft-versus-host disease; cyclophosphamide lowers the risk but\nnot to zero. Still, the transplant was necessary to save her life, and her mom\npointed out that some risk was unavoidable, no matter the type of donor: A\nfriend of Amelia\u2019s got graft-versus-host even with a perfectly matched one.\nDoctors were able to treat Amelia\u2019s complications, and she returned to school\nlast August. The pediatric trial she was part of is ongoing.\n\nIn adults, where more data are available, doctors are already moving ahead\nwith mismatched, unrelated donors. Between this and half-matched family\nmembers, patients who once might have had zero donors are now finding\nthemselves with multiple possibilities. Doctors can be choosier too: They can\nselect the youngest donor, for example, or match on characteristics such as\nblood type. The larger pool of donors also prevents situations like Arias\u2019s,\nin which a single matched donor who signed up years ago is no longer\navailable, which happens with some regularity. Cyclophosphamide is now\nroutinely used in matched transplants too, because it lowers the risk of\ngraft-versus-host disease even further.\n\nArias\u2019s mismatched unrelated donor in the trial was an anonymous 22-year-old\nman who lives somewhere in the United States. When Arias and I spoke last\nmonth, it had been almost exactly two years since his transplant. He\u2019s cancer\nfree. He and his wife just welcomed a baby girl. None of this would have\nlikely been possible without the transplant, without the donor, without a\n70-year-old drug that had been smartly repurposed.\n\nSarah Zhang is a staff writer at The Atlantic.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
