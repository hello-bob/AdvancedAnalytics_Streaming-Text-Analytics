Witton's Blog: Why we think giant pterosaurs could fly\n\n## Thursday 31 May 2018\n\n### Why we think giant pterosaurs could fly\n\nGiant azhdarchid pterosaur in flight. Images like this virtually always\ntrigger discussions about the validity of giant pterosaur flight hypotheses.  \n---  \n  \nEvery so often the idea of flightless giant pterosaurs circulates in the press\nor on social media. It doesn't take much to ignite these discussions: a new\ngiant pterosaur fossil, a PR event from a museum, or simply artwork\nemphasising the size of giant flying reptiles will see someone, somewhere,\nquestioning their flightworthiness. These suggestions are often made with\nstrong conviction, to the extent of dismissing or even arguing with scientists\nwho study pterosaur anatomy and biomechanics. After all, how can any sensible\nindividual think that animals with 10 m wingspans and body masses hovering\naround 250 kg were capable of flight? At most they were gliders, or flighted\nas juveniles and flightless as adults, right?\n\nConfession time: as someone actively involved in research and outreach on\nthese animals, I often find these discussions frustrating, for two reasons.\nThe first is that, among those who actually study pterosaur functional\nmorphology \u2013 that is, those who make detailed observations and measurements of\npterosaur fossils, compile biomechanical data and use computer modelling to\nobjectively test their flight capacity \u2013 there is no controversy about the\nvolant nature of these animals, even at their maximum size. Peer-reviewed\nclaims that pterosaurs were flightless are genuinely rare (perhaps limited to\nSato et al. 2009; Henderson 2010 and Prentice et al. 2011 in the last decade)\nand have a consistent record of being flawed on some critical anatomical or\nfunctional detail (Witton and Habib 2010). There is no debate about giant\npterosaur flight among those of us who study their fossils: the press and\nsocial media fuss about the topic is a genuine palaeontological nontroversy.\n\nThe second source of frustration is that, away from technical literature,\ndiscussions of giant pterosaur flight frequently suffer from major cases of\nDunning-Kruger effect, especially when parties have knowledge of planes. I've\nexperienced this a lot in my career, and not just in the wilds of social\nmedia: many of my TV and film consultancy jobs have required defending basic\ntenets of pterosaur anatomy - even their basic, there-for-all-to-see\nproportions preserved in articulated fossils - to folks who just can't or\nwon't believe what the fossils show. Having a casual understanding of engine-\ndriven man-made flying machines does not equate to knowing all there is about\neverything that has ever flown, but you would not know this from some\nconversations.\n\nOur controversial giant azhdarchid friends Arambourgiania philadelphiae\n(middle) and Hatzegopteryx thambema (right), compared to a record-breaking\ngiraffe and the Disacknowledgement.  \n---  \n  \nWhether through naivety of palaeontological theory or unwillingness to accept\ngood data, the lack of accessible overviews of current thinking on giant\npterosaur flight probably fuels this ongoing nontroversy. What's needed, it\nseems, is a synthesis of modern ideas on giant pterosaur flight and\njustification for why pterosaur experts don't challenge this idea. I've\nattempted this below, including sufficient methodological detail and\nreferences so that anyone wanting to understand these ideas will have a useful\njumping-off point, and to establish what needs to be overturned to challenge\nthe null hypothesis of giant pterosaur locomotion. Our focus will be on the\nlargest of all pterosaurs, giant members of the clade Azhdarchidae, as they\nare the main subject of most flightless claims (above). They are also among\nthe most familiar giant pterosaurs, their number including species such as\nQuetzalcoatlus and Hatzegopteryx. The general points made below pertain to all\nlarge pterosaurs, however.\n\n### Evidence from comparative anatomy\n\nGiant azhdarchids are invariably known from scant remains, sometimes a handful\nof fragments representing bones from across the skeleton or, in the case of\nQuetzalcoatlus northropi, an incomplete left wing (e.g. Lawson 1975; Frey and\nMartill 1996; Buffetaut et al. 2002; Vremir 2010; Martill and Moser 2018).\nOrdinarily, fragmentary remains are a barrier to interpreting the locomotory\nstrategies of extinct organisms but flighted lifestyles adapt animal bodies to\nsuch an extreme degree that just a few bones can betray volant habits. It\u2019s\nevident that even the largest pterosaurs bore wing anatomy comparable to their\nsmaller, incontrovertibly flightworthy relatives. Although no complete giant\nwings are known, our fragments indicate similar linear forelimb bone\nproportions to smaller azhdarchids. Their wing joints \u2013 including details of\ntheir elbows, wrists and wing finger knuckle \u2013 are well understood, and\nindicate typical properties of pterosaur wing motion and function. We can make\na number of predictions concerning muscle extent for giant taxa, the most\nimportant being related to the presence of a huge deltopectoral crest on their\nhumeri. This broad flange of bone, situated at the proximal end of the\nhumerus, anchored many muscles running from the shoulder to the wing and\npowered flapping motions in flight (Bennett 2003), so is a clear correlate for\npowered flight in giant species. The seemingly-small deltopectoral crest on\nthe Hatzegopteryx humerus is sometimes raised as evidence of reduced flight\nability: it\u2019s actually just badly preserved with lots of bone missing on all\nmargins (Buffetaut et al. 2002).\n\nA collection of giant azhdarchid bones: A, cervical vertebra of Arambourgiania\nphiladelphiae; B, humerus of Quetzalcoatlus northropi, C-D, the rather broken\nproximal humerus of Hatzegopteryx thambema. Other than their huge size (scale\nbars represent 100 mm) and some details of robustness, these bones are\nidentical to those of smaller, incontrovertibly flying pterosaurs.  \n---  \n  \nThe only significant difference between the wings of giant and smaller\nazhdarchids concerns bone robustness, especially that of their joints. We\nwould predict expanded wing bone diameters in large fliers as they enhance\nresistance to bending, and as giant animals they are going to experience\nproportionally greater bending stresses. If they flew, giant pterosaurs should\nhave very large wing bones indeed, and - as is evident from the adjacent\nimages - this is exactly what we find. Witton and Habib (2010) noted that the\nhumeral shafts of giant azhdarchids are comparable in diameter to those of\ngiant mammals, like hippos, despite the pterosaurs being a fraction of their\nweight (Witton 2008; Henderson 2010). Giant azhdarchid wing bones perform\nexceptionally well in bending strength tests, being able to resist multiple\nbody weights before failing (Witton and Habib 2010), and their expanded\ndiameters maintaining relative failure levels comparable to those of small or\nmid-sized pterosaurs, despite their size (Witton et al., in prep).\n\nPterosaur humeral scaling: as pterosaurs got bigger, their wing bones and\njoints expanded disproportionately to accommodate greater stresses incurred in\nflight and launch. Image from Witton (2013).  \n---  \n  \nBut for all their expansion, giant azhdarchid wings retain exceptionally thin\nbone walls. Even in Hatzegopteryx, the most robust of the group, they\u2019re only\n4-7 mm thick. This is a high value for a pterosaur, but still (in relation to\nbone diameter) at the low end of the cortical thickness spectrum. Other giant\nspecies have cortices of just 2 mm or so, values only just slightly larger\nthan those of mid-sized pterosaurs. Expanded but bone-lite wings are another\nfeature of flying creatures, being common to most flying birds and all large\npterosaurs, and offering their owners a lightweight but bending-resistant\nflight skeleton. However, what optimises these skeletons for flight\ncompromises resistance to buckling forces, which is why most non-volant\nanimals tend to have much thicker cortices. The correlation between thin bone\nwalls and flight is not watertight (Hutchinson 2001) but it's a feature we\nwould predict for any seriously large flying animal, and is thus consistent\nwith volant habits in giant pterosaur species.\n\n### Flight models\n\nIt\u2019s often asked how animals as large as the biggest azhdarchids could attain\nand sustain flight. It\u2019s important to stress that no-one imagines giant\nazhdarchids as breezy fliers flitting around Cretaceous plains like busy\nsongbirds. As animals operating close to the size limits of flight for the\nazhdarchoid bauplan (Marden 1994; Habib and Cunningham pers. comm. in Witton\n2010; Habib 2013) we should assume a flight frequency comparable to our\nlargest modern fliers \u2013 creatures like bustards, geese, swans, albatrosses and\nso forth. Though different in flight mechanics these birds are united in their\nrelatively low launch frequencies, taking to the air when they must (such as\nto evade danger) or when they have long distances to travel. Launch is very\nenergy-demanding because of their great body masses, and in some cases\nspecific environmental conditions are needed (such as space for taxiing in\nalbatross), limiting their options for frequent takeoff. We should assume the\nsame was true for large azhdarchids: their functional morphology and trackways\nshow strong terrestrial abilities (Hwang et al. 2002; Witton and Naish 2008,\n2013) and they probably spent a lot of time grounded, only flying when\nharassed, or wanting to move far and fast.\n\nWhen imagining giant pterosaurs flying, we need to have birds like the kori\nbustard in mind: large, powerful animals which are strong fliers, but unable\nto flit about the sky like small songbirds or bats. When these guys take off,\nthey mean it.

Even so, models of muscle\nenergy availability show that giant pterosaurs could not launch aerobically\n(that is, using muscle contractions supplied with oxygen) and they had to rely\non stronger, but less endurable, anaerobic muscle contractions. Anaerobic\nmuscle power is essential to launch in the largest birds and almost certainly\nplayed a role in extinct giant insect flight, too (Marden 1994, see graph\nbelow), so its inferred use in giant pterosaurs is quite plausible. This\nreliance on anaerobic muscle power would necessitate resting periods between\nlaunches (hence the inability to launch continuously like a small flyer) as\nwell as after vigorous bouts of flapping. Witton and Habib (2010) predicted\nthat the hard flapping window for a giant azhdarchid was about 90 seconds,\nafter which a rest was needed. So, does that limit our giants to turkey-like\nburst flights?\n\nLaunch for giant azhdarchids - like Quetzalcoatlus northropi - would be no\nmore challenging than it is for large birds. The dotted line on this graph\nrepresents the minimum muscle energy output needed for flight. Using the same\nmechanism of anaerobic muscle power as large living fliers, giant azhdarchids\nare on the right side of that line. From Marden (1994).  \n---  \n  \nProbably not. One of the world's leading experts on animal flight, Mike Habib,\nfound that Colin Pennycuick\u2019s freeware Flight programme \u2013 software designed to\nmodel bird flight - can be easily modified to predict pterosaur gliding and\nsoaring capabilities, even accounting for the differences between feathered\nand membranous wings (see Witton and Habib 2010 for this methodology). Using\nthis software, Mike and I predicted that giant azhdarchids were supreme\nsoarers, easily able to sustain long-distance gliding even at body masses of\n180-250 kg (Witton and Habib 2010). Predicted giant flight velocities exceeded\n90 kph and, in that 90 second flapping burst, giant azhdarchids would cover\nseveral kilometres - plenty of distance to seek areas of uplift such as\ndeflected winds or thermals. Having located these, azhdarchids could easily\nadopt energy-saving soaring to recover their flight muscles, their glide\nratios being consistent with those of large soaring birds such as storks,\nProcellariiformes and raptors. Mike has presented calculations that these\ngiants would have sufficient on-board energy resources to travel the planet,\ntheir speed and flight range being sufficient to ignore most geographical\nbarriers. Note that these models assume modern day parameters of atmospheric\ndensity and gravity: we do not need to modify these to keep giant azhdarchids\nairborne. Sure, if you did change these parameters you might make the job\neasier, but the giants already have very strong flight performance without it.\nIf you don't buy this, remember that you can play around with Flight yourself:\ndownload the program, get the method and pterosaur parameters from our open\naccess paper and go at it. None of the science behind these animals is\nmystical - the methods are entirely conventional and repeatable.\n\n### Too heavy to fly?\n\nFor all this talk of modelling pterosaur flight at quarter-tonne masses, two\nsets of authors have proposed that giant pterosaurs were simply too heavy to\nattain flight. Sato et al. (2009) based this on their understanding of\nprocellariiform takeoff, modelling a maximum possible volant mass of 40 kg for\nthese birds and assuming the same limit must apply to pterosaurs. The next\nyear, Don Henderson (2010) compiled a series of volumetric estimates of\npterosaur mass including a 450 kg Quetzalcoatlus. Don \u2013 probably correctly \u2013\nassumed that such an animal would be too heavy to fly.\n\nMike and I addressed both these proposals in a 2010 publication about giant\npterosaur flight. On Sato et al. (2009), we found numerous problems with the\novert biomechanical links drawn between bird and pterosaur flight. Avian and\npterosaur anatomy is comparable enough to assume some broad analogies in wing\nshape and flight styles (e.g. Hazlehurst and Rayner 1992), but the detailed\nkinematics of flight \u2013 including launch \u2013 are too distinct to assume that the\nsize limits of one group apply to the other. There are reasons to think\npterosaurs launched in a very different way to birds (see below) and were\nsubject to a different set of scaling regimes and size limits (Habib 2008,\n2013; Witton and Habib 2010). Sato et al. (2009) may have predicted a flight\nmass limit for long-winged, dynamically soaring birds, but the application of\nthis limit to flying reptiles is not supported by our understanding of\npterosaur and avian biomechanics.\n\nDon Henderson's (2010) Quetzalcoatlus model compared to the articulated\nskeleton of the small, completely known azhdarchid Zhejiangopterus\nlinhaiensis. Note the clear distinction in torso size, and the actual torso\nlength of the fossil pterosaur compared to the humerus. Images from Henderson\n(2010) and Cai and Wei (1994).  \n---  \n  \nWe found a much simpler issue with Don Henderson\u2019s half-tonne Quetzalcoatlus\nmodel: its body was simply too large. Don based his work on a silhouette in\nWellnhofer\u2019s (1991) pterosaur encyclopaedia, a reasonable decision given the\npaucity of reconstructions of this animal at the time, but ultimately a\nproblematic one for making accurate mass estimations. Azhdarchoids were\nrelatively poorly known in the early 1990s and Wellnhofer\u2019s silhouette\nreflects this, being a mostly imaginary pterosaur only accurate in wingspan.\nCrucially, its body is monstrously oversized at 1.5 m long. Complete\nazhdarchoids discovered since this time, including that of the azhdarchid\nZhejiangopterus, have shoulder-hip lengths only 30-50 % longer than their\nhumeri (above) and - in lieu of giant pterosaur torso fossils - we have to\nassume this was true for the giants, too. The 544 mm long humerus of Q.\nnorthropi translates to a predicted torso length of just c. 750 mm \u2013 a\nfraction of the size used in Don\u2019s estimate. Mike and I adjusted Don's\ncalculations to a more reasonable body proportion and, presto, the predicted\nmass was in the more familiar quarter-tonne range, a value flight models are\nhappy to see launching and soaring without difficulty (Witton and Habib 2010).\n\n### The key to everything: quad launch\n\nA critical hypothesis for giant pterosaur flight concerns recent\ninterpretations of their launch strategy. This idea is that pterosaurs \u2013\nprobably all of them \u2013 took off from a quadrupedal start, not a bird-like\nbipedal one. The quad-launch hypothesis has origins in technical literature\ndating back to 2008 (Habib 2008, 2013, Witton and Habib 2010) but has a longer\nhistory through Mike H\u2019s and Jim Cunningham\u2019s contributions to the Dinosaur\nMailing List. In retrospect, quad launch can be seen as a unifying hypothesis\nin studies of giant pterosaur flight, the piece of the jigsaw that allowed us\nto see how data from comparative anatomy, body masses and relative bone\nstrength fit together. Before quad-launch, pterosaur flight models struggled\nto transfer giant azhdarchids from the ground to the air and were forced to\ncap their body masses at unrealistically low values (e.g. 75 kg in Chatterjee\nand Templin 2004) in order to launch them like big birds. Other than the fact\nthat masses of 75 kg are untenable for creatures the size of giraffes (they\u2019d\nneed to be something like 70-80% air; Witton 2008), bipedal launch models\nsuffer from several biomechanical issues involving bone strength, limb bone\nscaling and muscle size, as well as inconsistencies concerning pterosaur\ngaits. It's these issues which Mike and Jim investigated in their studies,\nmaking them the first researchers to approach pterosaur launch with\nobjectivity, rather than a priori assuming an avian launch model, and bending\npterosaur palaeobiology until it fit.\n\nRatios of limb bone strength in birds and pterosaurs. Positive values trend\ntowards strength in humeri vs. femora, while negative values skew towards\nstronger femora vs. humeri. I've left the caption on for greater explanation.\nFrom Habib (2008).  \n---  \n  \nLet's unpack these points in a little more detail. Firstly, the main launch\nlimbs of flying animals are - above body masses of 500 g - stronger than their\nnon-launching counterparts, and scale with more pronounced positive allometry\n(Habib 2008). This reflects launch being the most demanding part of flight.\nLook closely at a launching animal (high speed video helps) and you'll see\nthat flight does not begin with a flap, but a leap: something like 80-90 % of\nlaunch effort stems from a powerful jump initiated by the main launch limbs.\nThis explains why birds have proportionally robust and strong hindlimb\nskeletons but relatively slender wing bones: as they increase in size, their\nlegs must become proportionally stronger to initiate flight at greater masses\n(Habib 2008). Pterosaurs, in contrast, show the opposite condition: their\nforelimbs are larger and stronger than their legs, with this relationship\nincreasingly pronounced in larger species. Mike's 2008 study quantified this\ndistinction, showing that the section modulus - a value proportionate to the\nstrength of a given cross section - is consistently larger in pterosaur humeri\nthan femora, and vice versa in birds, and that these ratios are more extreme\nat larger body sizes (see diagram, above). We presented similar data\nhighlighting distinction in limb bone scaling in our 2010 paper, as well as\nquantifying the relative weakness of azhdarchid femora - their neck vertebrae\nare actually stronger than this major limb bone. Their humeri, in contrast,\nwere very strong even in giant taxa modelled at the upper limits of pterosaur\nmass estimates (below). This is already a strong sign of a forelimb-dominated\nlaunch strategy in giants, and there's more to consider yet.\n\nRaw data on azhdarchid limb bone strength from Witton and Habib (2010). Note\nthe 'avian expectation' column - pterosaur bones do not scale in the same\nmanner as bird bones, indicating a different regime of biomechanical selection\npressures, and thus different limits on parameters like size.  \n---  \n  \nSecondly, the avian skeleton has two large girdles for limb muscles: an\nenlarged shoulder and chest region for flight muscles, and an enhanced pelvic\nregion to anchor those powerful hindlimb launch muscles. Pterosaurs, in\ncontrast, have only one large limb girdle - their shoulders, making this the\nde facto likely candidate for powering their launch cycles. Using volumetric\nmodelling, Paul (2002) predicted that a giant azhdarchid would have space for\n50 kg of muscle in their pectoral region, a value appropriate for initiating\nflight in 200-250 kg animals (Marden 1994). This strategy is a far more\neconomical use of muscle mass because the same muscles that power flight can\nalso initiate launch, thus allowing quad launchers to have smaller torsos -\nand thus lower masses - than bipedal launchers. For all their power, the\nmoment birds have launched their legs are effectively useless - they're just\ndead weight to be hauled around until it's time to land.\n\nReconstructed skeletons of large and giant azhdarchids in quad-launch poses,\nfrom Naish and Witton (2017). Note how the nearly completely known\nQuetzalcoatlus sp. - D - E - lacks a large site for hindlimb muscles - that's\ntypical of all pterosaurs, and an important argument in favour of quad launch.  \n---  \n  \nThis is an critical point for giant pterosaur flight as it allows us to make\nhypotheses about body size maximums related to launch strategy. Because quad\nlaunch is a mass-efficient route to flight we can hypothesise that quad\nlaunchers could attain much larger overall sizes and masses than bipedal\nlaunchers (Witton and Habib 2010; Habib 2013). As everyone knows, this is\nborne out in our fossil record of volant birds, which max out at 5-6 m\nwingspans and masses of 22-40 kg (Ksepka 2014), while giant azhdarchids\nattained wingspans of 10 m and 200-250 kg body masses. Mass-efficient launch\nmechanics is almost certainly a major factor in how azhdarchids became so big,\nespecially combined with the exceptional azhdarchoid ability for skeletal\npneumaticity (Claessens et al. 2009).\n\nFossil birds like Pelagornis sandersi are pretty big (extant bird with the\ngreatest wingspan, the wandering albatross, shown top right), but they\nwouldn't be able to poke giraffes in the face when standing next to them. 5-6\nm wingspans are the known size limit for bird flight, and their inefficient\nlaunch mechanism is probably the cause. From Ksepka (2014).  \n---  \n  \nA further line of evidence for quad launch concerns pterosaur trackways. Habib\n(2008) also notes that launch in living tetrapod fliers correlates to\nterrestrial gait: the number of limbs used to locomote on the ground is the\nsame as the number used to take-off. Birds walk and launch with two legs,\nwhile bats walk and launch using all four. An extensive record of pterosaur\ntrackways shows that pterosaurs were quadrupedal animals like bats, and it\nstands to reason that they also launched from four limbs: they would contrast\nwith our living fliers if they had to shift gaits to take off. Our pterosaur\nfootprint record includes trackways of quadrupedal giant pterosaurs (Hwang et\nal. 2002), so we can comfortably extend this observation to them, too.\nIncidentally, the fact that several bats take off quadrupedally is often\noverlooked in discussions of pterosaur launch: bird-like bipedal launches\ndominate our consciousness only because we see them taking off every day, but\nthey do not represent the only way tetrapods can become airborne.\n\nQuad launch cycle in vampire bats Desmodus rotundus, traced from video\nfootage: this is a real, proven launch mechanic folks, not something dreamt up\nby pterosaur workers desperate to prove giant azhdarchids could fly. Several\nother bats launch in this way, too. From Schutt et al. (1997).  \n---  \n  \nThese points - bone strength, concentrations of muscle bulk, limb bone scaling\nand trackway data - are the cornerstones of the pterosaur quad launch\nhypothesis, an idea which explains many independently observed features of\npterosaur biomechanics, bone proportions and absolute size. Crucially, all of\nthese points can be investigated for giant azhdarchids, and there are no red\nflags suggesting quad launch did not apply to these pterosaurs. We can thus\nassume that giant azhdarchids used the most efficient launch mechanism\nconceivable for a tetrapod, negating any need for unreasonably low mass\nestimates or cliff jumping to become airborne. They were simply 'extreme'\nversions of the pterosaur bauplaun, not evolutionary weirdos that take us back\nto the biomechanical drawing board.\n\nDespite the sound scientific basis to quad-launch, it is sometimes dismissed\nout of hand, perhaps because many folks just can't imagine it working: this\nexcellent video by Mike and Julia Molnar does a good job of showing the\nkinematics. My experience is that counter-arguments are made without knowledge\nof its supporting data as they focus on less knowable components of the launch\ncycle, such as the speed of wing action or intuitive ideas about how high\npterosaurs could leap. These are poor arguments because they a) are largely\nspeculative, and not based on measurable/observable phenomena like bone\nstrength or trackways; and b) ignore the fact that any launch mechanic\nrequires rapid deployment of wings or an ability to obtain good ground\nclearance. We have to assume giant pterosaurs could achieve these feats no\nmatter what our preferred launch strategy is. Moreover, somewhat ironically,\nthe elevated flight speeds necessitated by giant pterosaur mass actually\nminimises some of these concerns. Flapping amplitude scales negatively with\nanimal size and flight speed, making ground clearance less of an issue for\nlarge fliers than smaller ones (Habib 2008).\n\n### Flying the gauntlet\n\nLet's put all this together - congratulations if you've waded through this\nlong, often technical post. Giant azhdarchids...\n\n  * are poorly known, but have anatomy consistent with volant habits in every known aspect.\n  * do not seem to have struggled with take-off energetics more than any other large flyer.\n  * are often anatomically mischaracterised, being overly compared to extant birds or modelled in ways which distort their likely flight parameters.\n  * evolved from animals with a fundamentally more efficient launch strategy than that of birds, which lifts their body mass ceiling well above that predicted for avians. Every tested aspect of giant azhdarchid anatomy points to retention of this launch strategy even at their huge sizes.\n  * have flight parameters which, when modelled using conventional animal flight software in modern-grade atmosphere and gravity, equate to excellent flight performance, analogous to that of large soaring birds.\n\nThe take-home message is that interpretations of giant azhdarchids as flying\nanimals are based on numerous lines of investigation and hypotheses which\nsupport and predict one another. Moreover, the methods used in these studies\nare entirely conventional techniques of palaeontological inquiry, and to\ndisregard or ignore them requires dismissal of entire scientific fields of\nstudy. Don't buy the limb bone strength studies? Fine, then you also don't buy\nbeam theory or structural engineering. Don't believe the flight analyses? OK,\nbut you're also challenging software written by noted experts in animal\nflight, using data measured from real flying animals and a deep understanding\nof aerodynamics.\n\nThis is not to say that we know all there is to know about giant pterosaur\nflight - far from it. They remain poorly known animals and we can only guess\nat their variation in flight performance. Who knows, maybe a flightless\nspecies will turn up one day - this is not a ridiculous concept, we just don't\nhave any evidence for it yet. But, for now, anyone seriously wanting to\nchallenge this interpretation needs to discredit a robust theoretical\nfoundation of pterosaur flight mechanics and provide a superior interpretation\nof the many strands of evidence we've discussed. This seems like a tall order\nto me, but it's the gauntlet that anyone who says giant pterosaurs were 'too\nbig to fly' or 'they needed different gravity' has to run. Such comments\nreflect an ignorance or unwillingness to engage with a growing body of sound\ntechnical research on these animals, and - unlike giant pterosaurs - these\narguments just don't fly.\n\n### Enjoy monthly insights into palaeoart, fossil animal biology and\noccasional reviews of palaeo media?

If big azhdarchids were flightless, we would expect\nselection to rapidly favour a reduction of things like the wing distal to the\nhand, the notarium, DP crest etc. or drift to simply kill them off. We might\nalso expect an increase in leg musculature and pelvis size etc. for a fully\nterrestrial animal. None of these show up in very large pterosaurs. A possible\ncounter to this would be that juvniles could fly and adults could not, but you\nmight still then expect the largest animals to have proportionally smaller\ndistal wings.\n\nReplyDelete\n\nReplies\n\n    1.

The Ksepka study cited above downsized A.\nmagnificens somewhat, predicting wingspans of 5-6 m, with most methods\npredicting a size at the lower end of that range. Masses surpassing 60kg need\nwingspans exceeding 6.5 m or so, but this also requires unrealistically large\nprimary feather lengths for the A. magnificens material. Ksepka did not\nprovide a mass estimate for his downsized A. magnificens (which is fair, the\npaper wasn't about teratorn flight), but a crude wingspan/mass regression\nbased on my own datasets gives a mass of c. 40 kg for a 5.5 m span teratorn.\n\nDelete\n\nReplies\n\nReply\n\n    2.

I am Brazilian and I use the translator to help\nme a little.\n\nSo... recently released some news about a supposed species of giant pterosaur\ndubbed \"Dracula\". And in some channels it was reported that the animal may\nhave had 11-20 meters of wingspan and a body mass of up to 500 kg.\n\nThe first thing I think was: Wow, too big for fly. Lets see what Mr. Witton\nwill say about that....\n\nThe news itself later commented the possibility of being an animal incapable\nof flying.\n\nAnd when I started reading your text with \"Every so often the idea of\nflightless giant pterosaurs circulates in the press or on social media...\", I\nthought it would be just about Dracula that you would write.\n\nI mean, I believe it was this news that brought up the question about\npterosaurs who lost their ability to fly.\n\nSo, what do you think about this? This size and mass were overestimated?\n\nthe news I mentioned: http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/giant-\npterosaur-1.4589450\n\nReplyDelete\n\nReplies\n\n    1. Mark Witton1 June 2018 at 01:20\n\nIt's difficult to know that to say about the 'Dracula' pterosaur. So far as I\nknow, and I think this echoes the assumptions of others, it's a reconstruction\nbased on numerous scraps of material, and therefore sensitive to the\nassumptions made by the researchers putting it back together. They have not\npublished their calculations behind either the wingspan or mass (which is why\nit is not discussed above) but, having some experience with the material in\nquestion, I'm very sceptical of their >11 m wingspan estimates and 500 kg\nmasses. The Romanian giant wing bone material I'm familiar with is no larger\nthan the bones we have for Q. northropi so, unless there's new material\navailable, they have almost certainly over-estimated the size of the animal.\nTheir skeletal mount is proportionally odd (the long torso issue discussed\nabove is a problem again), maybe this factors into their reconstruction. Of\ncourse, until they publish their findings and reconstruction method properly\nwe're just guessing about its validity, but - based on what I know of the\nmaterial, and my experience with pterosaurs generally - I am sceptical of\ntheir proposals.\n\nDelete\n\nReplies\n\nReply\n\n    2.

Mark Witton1 June 2018 at 00:59\n\nI've been thinking about the Manafzadeh and Padian paper a lot this week, so\nI'll try to keep this brief. The methods applied to the quail pelvis are\ninteresting and potentially very useful, but whether this study tells us\nanything about pterosaurs is questionable - maybe even doubtful, at this stage\nat least. Pterosaur pelves and femora are radically different to those of\nbirds: they converge in a few aspects, but the list of distinctions is much,\nmuch longer than their similarities. Provisional investigations of pterosaur\nhindlimb soft-tissues show this applies to muscle distributions too, which\nopens the possibility that the ligament system - though probably sharing the\nsame ventrally thickened components as all reptiles (including birds) - might\nhave differed also. We know that reptile hindlimb ligaments can permit some\ndegree of sprawling because, obviously, lizards and crocs can abduct their\nhindlimbs without problem. This implicates that simply having those thick\nventral ligaments is not a barrier to sprawling limbs, and that specifics of\nskeletal and soft-tissue anatomy are the actual controls on hindlimb ROM.\nErgo, we need to understand both these elements in detail to ascertain\npterosaur hindlimb motion and their likely flight pose. The study does not do\nthis however, bringing pterosaurs into the discussion very late in the paper\nand without necessary consideration of their osteological or soft-tissue\ncharacteristics. The resultant discussion is too brief to justify its sweeping\nclaim and, for me, it instead raises numerous, critical questions about its\nmultitude of assumptions and neglected data. A lot of work is needed to\nvalidate the quail-pterosaur analogy, including deepening our understanding of\nsauropsid - and especially pterosaur - soft-tissues and functional morphology.\nUntil this is done, I suggest treating the conclusions of this study with\ncaution.\n\nDelete\n\nReplies\n\nReply\n\nReply\n\n  8.

Any flying animal, regardless of size, needs to have the center of\nlift aligned with the center of mass. But giant azhdarchids' extremely long\nnecks and huge heads, no matter how lightly constructed, would move that cM\nway forward. Others, notably Colin Palmer, have postulated forward-swept wings\nto allay that difficulty, claiming other aerodynamic advantages for them as\nwell. This sounds very reasonable (though it's not reflected in the picture\nthat opens this blog post) And sure enough, those extremely elongate\nmetacarpals that you say would prove so advantageous for a ground stalking\nlifestyle would fill the bill here as well (evolution is very economical!) But\nmy wonder is, is it enough? I've read one writer (can't remember his name,\nunfortunately) who estimated that perhaps a third of Arambourgiana's total\nmass was in its head and neck. Is it possible to reconstruct an azhdarchid\n(scale is irrelevant here) such that cM and cP line up? Subsidiary question:\nif I understood Palmer's paper on headcrests correctly (and I'm not at all\nsure I did) the head itself, especially held at the downward angle that many\nresearchers think they were, would generate some lift. Act, in effect, as a\nsort of canard.

His books include a travelogue\nset in post-apartheid South Africa and the award-winning \u201cCongo: The Epic\nHistory of a People\u201d about the former Belgian colony.\n\nIn his latest work, however, he has turned his attention to a group of\n\u201cvoiceless\u201d people much closer to home: voters in Europe and the United\nStates.\n\nA feeling of disenfranchisement, Van Reybrouck argues, lies behind the anger\non display among electorates across the West. The rise of populists like\nDonald Trump in the United States, Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, Marine Le\nPen in France and Frauke Petry in Germany, and the fury on display during the\nBrexit debate all share a common cause: an attempt by establishment\npoliticians to shut down the debate. It\u2019s because citizens are feeling\nexcluded that the shouting is getting louder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe anger of citizens we see today is not a danger for democracy,\u201d says Van\nReybrouck. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift. It shows that people are committed and are willing to\nengage with their society. It\u2019s a gift, but it\u2019s wrapped in barbed wire.\u201d The\ntrick, with this gift, he says, is to figure out how to unwrap it.\n\n* * *\n\nVan Reybrouck\u2019s insights came out of the 2010-2011 Belgian political crisis,\nin which the country\u2019s elected officials failed to form a government for 541\ndays. What most political commentators wrote off as a quirk of an unwieldy\npolitical process became, for Van Reybrouck, the symptom of a larger problem.\n\nThe idea that citizens were given the right to speak only every four or five\nyears, and only by ticking a box on a piece of a paper, struck him as absurd \u2014\nand counterproductive. \u201cDemocracy is quintessentially people talking to each\nother,\u201d he says. \u201cBut our democracies have become very, very silent. We vote\nin silence, and then we shout ... on Facebook and Twitter. But a sort of\nmeaningful discussion with people who might have different ideas is not taking\nplace anymore.\u201d\n\n> \u201cThe easiest job for a politician today is to be a populist leader.\u201d\n\nIt is not just that people feel voiceless, it\u2019s that they are voiceless.\nGovernments across Europe have met anger with anger. Attacks on populism have\nbeen just as vitriolic as their targets. As those expressions of anger are\ndismissed as ignorant, uninformed or retrograde, the gulf between the elite\nand the broader public has grown. \u201cMany of the politicians today remind me of\nthe aristocracy in 1788,\u201d says Van Reybrouck. \u201cThe masses are shouting and\nyeah that\u2019s annoying, but the crisis won\u2019t come. One year later, the Bastille\nwas stormed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe mounting sense of frustration, he says, feeds into the populist narrative.\n\u201cThe easiest job for a politician today is to be a populist leader,\u201d he says.\nIf someone with \u201ca little more self-control than Donald Trump\u201d had taken up\nthe banner of populism in the United States, he or she would easily have swept\nup the votes of an increasingly frustrated electorate.\n\nReferendums may have become the tool of choice for politicians trying to\nreassure voters that they are being heard. But these offer only the illusion\nof control, says Van Reybrouck. In the Brexit debate, for instance, voters\nwere made to believe their vote mattered, but once the polls had closed and\nthe votes to leave had been counted, they quickly lost any say in how their\ndecision would be implemented. \u201cThe referendum has become the toy of populist\nleaders,\u201d says Van Reybrouck. \u201cI am deeply convinced that if we refuse to\nupdate democracy, we\u2019ll see the end of democracy, and quite soon.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nIn the midst of the Belgian crisis of 2011, Van Reybrouck launched G1000, an\nexperiment in participatory democracy that brought together 704 people chosen\nat random to discuss ideas for solving Belgium\u2019s political gridlock.\n\nParticipants were asked to express their feelings on various aspects of the\npolitical situation by rating the government\u2019s response to an issue on a scale\nof one to 10. They proposed steps that would incrementally improve that rating\nby a notch or two, and then discussed the ideas with their neighbors over\nseveral rounds of debate led by academics and political experts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the answers were gathered by the organizers, the result was a collection\nof tangible policy proposals that were handed over to the country\u2019s seven\npresidents of parliament. The format has since been adopted by political\nparties across Belgium, and the Netherlands has hosted more than 10 of its own\nG1000 events. The Dutch government has created a parliamentary commission to\nlook at democratic renewal. And in the city of Utrecht, the mayor\u2019s cabinet\nregularly confers with citizens for solutions to pressing policy issues, such\nas migration, that weren\u2019t on the table during electoral campaigns.\n\n> \u201cNot doing anything about our democracy is opening the gates to anarchy.\u201d\n\nSmall European countries, especially those that have gone through a crisis\nsuch as Belgium and Iceland are more willing to innovate and should become\nlaboratories for mechanisms of participatory democracy, he says. At the\nmoment, Ireland leads the pack. In 2012, 66 citizens were chosen by lot to\njoin 34 government officials in a debate on constitutional reforms. In\nOctober, the country repeated the process, randomly selecting 99 citizens to\ntackle some of the country\u2019s most politically sensitive questions, including\nlegalizing abortion and climate change.\n\nVan Reybrouck, who has laid out his ideas in his book, \u201cAgainst Elections: A\nCase for Democracy,\u201d has been invited by the leader of the Belgian senate to\nhold an experiment in which a chamber of citizens chosen by lot would join\nsenators in discussing issues that fall under the senate\u2019s purview, such as\nconstitutional reform and laws governing the organization of the federal\nsystem.\n\nThe idea, he is careful to say, is not to replace elections with a lottery.\nIt\u2019s to experiment with methods to bring the voices of citizens into the\ndemocratic process.\n\nAt the risk of sounding like a Cassandra prophesying the end of days, Van\nReybrouck cautions that our democracies have become ticking time bombs. \u201cI see\nwhy people fear anarchy when they hear me talk,\u201d he says. \u201cBut not doing\nanything about our democracy is opening the gates to anarchy.\u201d\n\n## Also On POLITICO\n\nPolitical science\n\n## How to beat populism\n\nBy Cas Mudde\n\n## German president: populists won\u2019t win\n\nBy Hortense Goulard\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Tags\n\nElections Euroskeptics National Politics\n\nRelated Countries\n\nBelgium The Netherlands United States\n\n## Our readers read next\n\nCommentary\n\n## Here\u2019s what a Le Pen presidency would really mean for France \u2014 and the EU\n\nApr 5 5 mins read\n\n## More from Esther King\n\n## Tokidoki\n\nAn inventive, down-to-earth restaurant with a small menu and big heart.\n\nFeb 8 2 mins read\n\n## Gazzetta\n\nA trendy, intimate neighborhood favorite serving up quality Italian food.\n\nNov 9 3 mins read\n\n## Le P\u2019tit Chouia En +\n\nCozy, unpretentious home-style Moroccan cuisine.\n\nSep 28 2 mins read\n\n## L\u2019Altitude\n\nA self-described neighborhood bar for music lovers, this spot is a local gem\nfar from the Brussels bubble crowd.\n\nOct 13 2 mins read\n\n", "frontpage": true}
