Perhaps, like many of us, you assumed these were the\nhandiwork of industrious birds, crafting nests for their young. However, these\nbundles, known as dreys, hold a different kind of life.\n\nGetty Images/iStockphoto\n\n### Understanding the Structure and Purpose of a Drey\n\nA drey is a marvel of natural engineering, constructed by squirrels to serve\nas a sturdy, safe home among the treetops. This leafy shelter is crafted from\nan assortment of materials gathered from the forest floor, including twigs,\nleaves, and occasionally bits of bark, all woven together into a cohesive\nstructure.\n\nThe exterior of a drey might appear haphazard at first glance, but it's\ndesigned to withstand the elements, from the scorching heat of summer to the\nbiting chill of winter. Inside, the nest is thoughtfully lined with soft,\ninsulating materials such as moss, feathers, or fur. This lining ensures that\nthe interior remains a warm and comfortable refuge for the squirrels residing\nwithin.\n\nGetty Images/iStockphoto\n\nGetty Images/iStockphoto\n\nThe purpose of a drey extends beyond mere shelter; it is a vital component of\nthe squirrel's lifecycle. These nests provide a secure location for squirrels\nto sleep, evade predators, and nurture their offspring. The strategic\nplacement of dreys high in the trees further safeguards the inhabitants from\nground-based threats and offers a vantage point to survey their surroundings\nfor danger and food sources.\n\n### Why It's Important to Leave Dreys Alone\n\nUpon discovering a drey nestled within the branches of a Virginia tree, it\nmight be tempting to get a closer look or even consider moving it. However,\nit's crucial to understand that touching or moving these structures can be\nhazardous and it's best to leave them alone.\n\nInterfering with a drey can have serious repercussions. Not only does it risk\ninjuring the resident squirrels, but it could also leave vulnerable young\nsquirrels without protection. Such actions could expose these creatures to\nharsh elements or predators, drastically affecting their chances of survival.\n\nTree squirrel nest high up in a leafy tree in soft focus\n\nGetty Images/iStockphoto\n\nSquirrels, being territorial by nature, might exhibit stress or defensive\nbehavior if they sense their home is under threat. This could lead to\nunnecessary conflict between humans and wildlife. Maintaining a respectful\ndistance ensures that we do not inadvertently cause distress or harm to these\nanimals.\n\nGet our free mobile app\n\n### How to Coexist with Squirrels and Their Dreys\n\nIf you discover a drey within the branches of a tree in your vicinity, embrace\nit as a chance to connect with nature from a distance. To avoid unnecessary\nconflicts, make your residence less attractive to these curious creatures by\nsealing off possible entrances and keeping attractants, such as bird feeders,\nat a distance from your home.\n\nUnderstanding and respecting the boundaries between our spaces and theirs is\nkey. By taking these steps, we can enjoy the dynamic presence of squirrels and\ntheir intriguing treetop homes without infringing on each other's domain,\nenriching our experience of Virginia diverse wildlife.\n\n## Plant Some Of These In Your Garden to Keep Mosquitoes Away\n\nAs we previously told you, mosquitoes are the most dangerous creatures on\nearth. If you want to keep them away from you're yard, these plants can help!\n\nGallery Credit: Michelle Heart\n\nLemon Grass\n\nGetty Images/iStockphoto\n\n## Lemon Grass\n\nIf you\u2019ve hosted a backyard barbeque or swim party, you\u2019ve likely lit some\ncitronella candles or tiki torches to try to keep mosquitoes away from\npestering your guests. Lemon Grass contains a good amount of that essential\noil, so HGTV says that when the plant leaves heat up in the sun or are burned\nin a fire they can reduce the number of mosquitoes by 49-79%.\n\nMarigolds\n\nPhoto by J K on Unsplash\n\n## Marigolds\n\nWho knew that Marigolds were good for something other than attracting bunnies?\n(Seriously, we have vivid childhood memories of the marigolds we proudly\nplanted in the front yard being destroyed by rabbits in a matter of days.)\nThey\u2019re easy to grow and ProFlowers explains that they have a chemical called\npyrethrum in them. It\u2019s an ingredient used in many repellants. Just find a way\nto protect them from those darn bunnies. They\u2019re cute, but they\u2019re relentless!\n\nGarlic\n\nPhoto by team voyas on Unsplash\n\n## Garlic\n\nIt turns out that vampires and mosquitoes have more than their love of sucking\nblood in common. It\u2019s not quite as effective as some of the other plants on\nthis list, but mosquitoes, aphids and ants don\u2019t like the odor coming from\ngarlic. If you\u2019re in a pinch, you can rub garlic juice on your skin and it\nwill help keep the mosquitoes away but it may also have unintended social\nconsequences too...\n\nLavender\n\nPhoto by Baraa Jalahej on Unsplash\n\n## Lavender\n\nYou know that lavender can make you feel more zen and even help you sleep\nbetter. HGTV says that the more camphor a lavender contains, the more\nmosquitoes hate it. Those essentials are naturally released when the plant\ngets warmed up on a sunny day, but you can also take advantage of them by\nsmushing up lavender leaves and flowers and rubbing them on your skin. That\u2019s\ngreat in a pinch and unlike rubbing garlic juice on yourself, people will\nprobably still talk to you after you coat yourself in lavender oil.\n\nRosemary\n\nPhoto by Z\u00e9 Maria on Unsplash\n\n## Rosemary\n\nWe love that so many plants on this list have a dual purpose. Keeping you from\nbecoming a mosquito buffet and a tasty way to season up your dinner. You can\nadd rosemary to everything from grilled chicken to potato salad to lemonades.\nMosquitoes, vegetable bugs and flies are big fans of the fresh, pine-like\nscent that it gives off, so Proflowers recommends tossing some into your\nbackyard fire to help repel the creepy crawlies.\n\nBasil\n\nPhoto by Alissa De Leva on Unsplash\n\n## Basil\n\nLess mosquitoes AND the essential ingredient for homemade pesto, how could you\ngo wrong here?! You may LOVE the smell of basil, but mosquitoes and flies\ndon\u2019t. The plant is also toxic to mosquito larvae so if you have unavoidable\nstanding water on your property, ProFlowers explains that putting basil near\nit can help keep mosquitoes from laying their eggs there.\n\nMint\n\nPhoto by Abby Boggier on Unsplash\n\n## Mint\n\nIf you plant mint, just be careful. It will grow quickly, take over your\ngarden and squish your other plants. Plant experts say it\u2019s best that if you\ngrow mint, to grow it in containers to keep it from becoming so invasive. That\nsaid, not only is the oil produced by mint plants great at repelling\nmosquitoes, but it can also provide you with a little relief if you put it on\nbites if one of those little blood suckers does get you.\n\nSage\n\nPhoto by Phillip Larking on Unsplash\n\n## Sage\n\nWhen your life is turned upside and nothing seems to be going right, you burn\nsage to cleanse the bad energy from your life. We\u2019re not sure if it actually\nworks, but some cultures believe it does. According to Proflowers, it will\nkeep the mosquitoes away even if it doesn\u2019t keep away the bad vibes. If you\u2019re\nusing it as a mosquito repellent, it\u2019s most effective when you throw some\nleaves into your fire. Some more pros of sage? It smells good and attracts\nhummingbirds. Hummingbirds are far more beautiful than mosquitoes.\n\nCatnip\n\nGetty Images/iStockphoto\n\n## Catnip\n\nAccording to ProFlowers, Catnip plants contain something called\n\u201cnepetalactone.\u201d It\u2019s the chemical that attracts cats but is a huge turn-off\nto mosquitoes, termites and cockroaches. In 2001, the American Chemical\nSociety published a study revealing that because of that chemical, Catnip is\nactually 10 times better at repelling mosquitoes than the DEET you find in\nmany bug sprays. It does attract cats, so if you\u2019re in an area with a stray\npopulation you may end up making a few new furry friends if you plant Catnip.\n\nBee Balm\n\nPhoto by Melissa Burovac on Unsplash\n\n## Bee Balm\n\nIf you\u2019re not allergic to bees, you may want to consider planting this one.\nThis one will attract lots of pollinators like bees, but the essential oils\nand aroma are a huge turn-off for blood-sucking mosquitoes.\n\nScented Geranium\n\nGetty Images/iStockphoto\n\n## Scented Geranium\n\nWe don\u2019t want to speak for everyone, but we certainly have vivid memories of\nour mom purchasing geraniums almost during almost every single outing to the\ngreenhouse. As an adult, you\u2019ve already realized your mom is pretty smart but\nit turns out she\u2019s even smarter than you realized! Scented geraniums are a big\nturnoff for both mosquitoes and flies. Neither insect cares for the light\ncitrus smell and a trace of citronella oil that these contain. Proflowers also\nclaims that geranium oil can help reduce scars, so smashing them up could\nbenefit you too.\n\nFiled Under: Alexandria, Arlington, Bird Nest Virginia, Bundles of Leaves in\nTrees Virginia, Centreville, Chesapeake, Dale City, Fun facts about Virginia\nNature, Hampton, Harrisonburg, Lynchburg, Mclean, Nature Warning for Virginia,\nNewport News, Norfolk, Portsmouth, Reston, Richmond, Roanoke, Squirrel Nests\nin Virginia, Suffolk, Virginia Beach\n\nCategories: Articles\n\n## More From 97X\n\nVirginia, This Is What The Paw Print Sticker On Your Mailbox Means\n\nVirginia, This Is What The Paw Print Sticker On Your Mailbox Means\n\nVirginia Goodwill Stores Will Not Take These 10 Items\n\nVirginia Goodwill Stores Will Not Take These 10 Items\n\nVirginia, If You Hear \u2018Code Brown\u2019 At Walmart, Leave Immediately\n\nVirginia, If You Hear \u2018Code Brown\u2019 At Walmart, Leave Immediately\n\nNebraska Woman Exploits Pump Glitch To Get Over $27,000 Of Free Gas\n\nNebraska Woman Exploits Pump Glitch To Get Over $27,000 Of Free Gas\n\nKentucky Man Asked Flight Attendants To Join \u2018Mile High Club\u2019 On Spirit Flight\n\nKentucky Man Asked Flight Attendants To Join \u2018Mile High Club\u2019 On Spirit Flight\n\nVirginia, Your Mail Carrier Cannot Accept These Gifts\n\nVirginia, Your Mail Carrier Cannot Accept These Gifts\n\nDid You Know This Rankin-Bass Car Is A Real Life Vehicle?\n\nDid You Know This Rankin-Bass Car Is A Real Life Vehicle?\n\nVirginia House Explodes During a Police Standoff, Suspect Inside\n\nVirginia House Explodes During a Police Standoff, Suspect Inside\n\nNebraska Thieves Steal $20K Worth of Left Shoes From Store\n\nNebraska Thieves Steal $20K Worth of Left Shoes From Store\n\n## Dwyer & MichaelsSee All Posts\n\nIllinois Arena Football Offering $1 Beers on Union Trades Night\n\nIllinois Arena Football Offering $1 Beers on Union Trades Night\n\nMichigan Men \u2018Sword Fight\u2019 With Machete, Shovel, Throw Poo Over Bad Sushi\n\nMichigan Men \u2018Sword Fight\u2019 With Machete, Shovel, Throw Poo Over Bad Sushi\n\nMoline Police Introduce New Tech Reporting System For Non-Emergency Crimes\n\nMoline Police Introduce New Tech Reporting System For Non-Emergency Crimes\n\nDwyer & Michaels Morning Show: Show Notes 04/19/24\n\nDwyer & Michaels Morning Show: Show Notes 04/19/24\n\n## Meet the DJsSee All DJs\n\nDwyer And Michaels\n\nDwyer And MichaelsRead Articles\n\nGoose\n\nGooseRead Articles\n\nBill Stage\n\nBill StageRead Articles\n\nMatt Wardlaw\n\nMatt WardlawRead Articles\n\nHairball\n\nHairballRead Articles\n\nMegan Johnson\n\nMegan JohnsonRead Articles\n\n## 97X on Facebook\n\n## Sign up for our newsletter\n\n## Recent Stories\n\nListen to Slash Shred on Composer Bear McCreary\u2019s Epic New Song\n\nListen to Slash Shred on Composer Bear McCreary\u2019s Epic New Song\n\nFrank Zappa and the Mothers\u2019 \u2018Whisky a Go Go, 1968\u2032 Announced\n\nFrank Zappa and the Mothers\u2019 \u2018Whisky a Go Go, 1968\u2032 Announced\n\nDid Earl Slick Have to Blow Up a Car for David Bowie Reunion?\n\nDid Earl Slick Have to Blow Up a Car for David Bowie Reunion?\n\nHow Ross Valory\u2019s Debut Connects With Journey\u2019s Earliest Triumphs\n\nHow Ross Valory\u2019s Debut Connects With Journey\u2019s Earliest Triumphs\n\nVinny Appice Details \u2018Amazing\u2019 Last Session With Ronnie James Dio\n\nVinny Appice Details \u2018Amazing\u2019 Last Session With Ronnie James Dio\n\n## Information\n\n  * EEO\n  * Marketing and Advertising Solutions\n  * Public File\n  * Need Assistance\n  * FCC Applications\n  * Report an Inaccuracy\n  * Terms\n  * Contest Rules\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Accessibility Statement\n  * Exercise My Data Rights\n  * Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\n  * Contact\n\n## Follow Us\n\n  * Visit us on Youtube\n  * Visit us on Facebook\n  * Visit us on Twitter\n  * Visit us on Instagram\n\n2024 97X, Townsquare Media, Inc.
