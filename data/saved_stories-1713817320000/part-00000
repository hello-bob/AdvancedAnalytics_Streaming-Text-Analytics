This year\u2019s report covers the rise of multimodal foundation models,\nmajor cash investments into generative AI, new performance benchmarks,\nshifting global opinions, and new major regulations.\n\nDon\u2019t have an afternoon to pore through the findings? Check out the high level\nhere.\n\n## A Move Toward Open-Sourced\n\nThis past year, organizations released 149 foundation models, more than double\nthe number released in 2022. Of these newly released models, 65.7% were open-\nsource (meaning they can be freely used and modified by anyone), compared with\nonly 44.4% in 2022 and 33.3% in 2021.\n\n## But At a Cost of Performance?\n\nClosed-source models still outperform their open-sourced counterparts. On 10\nselected benchmarks, closed models achieved a median performance advantage of\n24.2%, with differences ranging from as little as 4.0% on mathematical tasks\nlike GSM8K to as much as 317.7% on agentic tasks like AgentBench.\n\n## Biggest Players\n\nIndustry dominates AI, especially in building and releasing foundation models.\nThis past year Google edged out other industry players in releasing the most\nmodels, including Gemini and RT-2. In fact, since 2019, Google has led in\nreleasing the most foundation models, with a total of 40, followed by OpenAI\nwith 20. Academia trails industry: This past year, UC Berkeley released three\nmodels and Stanford two.\n\n## Industry Dwarfs All\n\nIf you needed more striking evidence that corporate AI is the only player in\nthe room right now, this should do it. In 2023, industry accounted for 72% of\nall new foundation models.\n\n## Prices Skyrocket\n\nOne of the reasons academia and government have been edged out of the AI race:\nthe exponential increase in cost of training these giant models. Google\u2019s\nGemini Ultra cost an estimated $191 million worth of compute to train, while\nOpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 cost an estimated $78 million. In comparison, in 2017, the\noriginal Transformer model, which introduced the architecture that underpins\nvirtually every modern LLM, cost around $900.\n\n## What AI Race?\n\nAt least in terms of notable machine learning models, the United States vastly\noutpaced other countries in 2023, developing a total of 61 models in 2023.\nSince 2019, the U.S. has consistently led in originating the majority of\nnotable models, followed by China and the UK.\n\n## Move Over, Human\n\nAs of 2023, AI has hit human-level performance on many significant AI\nbenchmarks, from those testing reading comprehension to visual reasoning.\nStill, it falls just short on some benchmarks like competition-level math.\nBecause AI has been blasting past so many standard benchmarks, AI scholars\nhave had to create new and more difficult challenges. This year\u2019s index also\ntracked several of these new benchmarks, including those for tasks in coding,\nadvanced reasoning, and agentic behavior.\n\n## Private Investment Drops (But We See You, GenAI)\n\nWhile AI private investment has steadily dropped since 2021, generative AI is\ngaining steam. In 2023, the sector attracted $25.2 billion, nearly ninefold\nthe investment of 2022 and about 30 times the amount from 2019 (call it the\nChatGPT effect). Generative AI accounted for over a quarter of all AI-related\nprivate investments in 2023.\n\n## U.S. Wins $$ Race\n\nAnd again, in 2023 the United States dominates in AI private investment. In\n2023, the $67.2 billion invested in the U.S. was roughly 8.7 times greater\nthan the amount invested in the next highest country, China, and 17.8 times\nthe amount invested in the United Kingdom. That lineup looks the same when\nzooming out: Cumulatively since 2013, the United States leads investments at\n$335.2 billion, followed by China with $103.7 billion, and the United Kingdom\nat $22.3 billion.\n\n## Where is Corporate Adoption?\n\nMore companies are implementing AI in some part of their business: In surveys,\n55% of organizations said they were using AI in 2023, up from 50% in 2022 and\n20% in 2017. Businesses report using AI to automate contact centers,\npersonalize content, and acquire new customers.\n\n## Younger and Wealthier People Worry About Jobs\n\nGlobally, most people expect AI to change their jobs, and more than a third\nexpect AI to replace them. Younger generations \u2014 Gen Z and millennials \u2014\nanticipate more substantial effects from AI compared with older generations\nlike Gen X and baby boomers. Specifically, 66% of Gen Z compared with 46% of\nboomer respondents believe AI will significantly affect their current jobs.\nMeanwhile, individuals with higher incomes, more education, and decision-\nmaking roles foresee AI having a great impact on their employment.\n\n## While the Commonwealth Worries About AI Products\n\nWhen asked in a survey about whether AI products and services make you\nnervous, 69% of Aussies and 65% of Brits said yes. Japan is the least worried\nabout their AI products at 23%.\n\n## Regulation Rallies\n\nMore American regulatory agencies are passing regulations to protect citizens\nand govern the use of AI tools and data. For example, the Copyright Office and\nthe Library of Congress passed copyright registration guidance concerning\nworks that contained material generated by AI, while the Securities and\nExchange Commission developed a cybersecurity risk management strategy,\ngovernance, and incident disclosure plan. The agencies to pass the most\nregulation were the Executive Office of the President and the Commerce\nDepartment.\n\nThe AI Index was first created to track AI development. The index collaborates\nwith such organizations as LinkedIn, Quid, McKinsey, Studyportals, the\nSchwartz Reisman Institute, and the International Federation of Robotics to\ngather the most current research and feature important insights on the AI\necosystem.\n\n## More News Topics\n\nEconomy and Markets, Language Processing, Law, Regulation, and Policy, Machine\nLearning\n\n## Follow us\n\nhttps://twitter.com/StanfordHAI https://www.facebook.com/StanfordHAI\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UChugFTK0KyrES9terTid8vA\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/stanfordhai\nhttps://www.instagram.com/stanfordhai\n\n### Newsletter Sign Up\n\nDon\u2019t miss out.
