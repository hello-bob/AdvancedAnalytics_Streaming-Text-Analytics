Now it\u2019s hitting the brakes.\n\nBy Amanda Coletta\n\nApril 23, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. EDT\n\nFifty-three people representing 22 nations take the Oath of Citizenship on\nOct. 12 in Edmonton, Alberta.

In\n2023, the population here grew by more than 1.2 million people, up 3.2 percent\nfrom the year before \u2014 the highest annual increase since 1957. About 98\npercent came from immigration.\n\nBut now, amid a housing affordability crisis and strain on social services,\nTrudeau\u2019s government is rolling up the welcome mat for some immigrants.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIt has capped the number of permanent residents it will welcome, announced a\ntemporary limit on international student visas and pledged to shrink the\nproportion of the population made up of temporary immigrants such as foreign\nworkers.\n\nA \u201cmassive spike\u201d in temporary immigrants has exceeded \u201cwhat Canada has been\nable to absorb,\u201d Trudeau told reporters this month. \u201cThat\u2019s something we need\nto get back under control.\u201d\n\nImmigration has long drawn high levels of support here, a consensus that cuts\nacross much of the political spectrum. Canada has been largely immune from the\nanti-immigrant backlash that\u2019s been a driving force in the politics of the\nUnited States and Europe. But there are signs that\u2019s shifting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn September, an Environics Institute poll found that 44 percent of people\nhere agreed \u201cthere is too much immigration to Canada\u201d \u2014 up 17 points from\n2022, the largest year-over-year change since it first asked the question in\n1977. Many expressed concern that immigration was driving up housing costs.\n\n\u201cThe shift has been in the public\u2019s confidence about how immigration is being\nmanaged,\u201d said Keith Neuman, a senior associate at the institute. \u201cIt\u2019s not a\nshift in how people feel about immigrants. ... It\u2019s not about the type of\npeople coming or their impact on the culture.\u201d\n\nFailure to restore that confidence, analysts say, could jeopardize the\nimmigration consensus.\n\n\u201cI think we need to address these issues,\u201d said Mike Moffatt, an associate\nprofessor at Western University\u2019s Ivey Business School in London, Ontario,\n\u201cbecause if we don\u2019t, we are absolutely putting that consensus at risk \u2014 and\nthat consensus has served Canada really well.\u201d\n\n###\n\n\u2018All good things have their limits\u2019\n\nThe plan was bold: By 2025, Canadian officials announced, the country would\ntake in nearly 1.5 million new permanent residents. For the most part, they\nwould be economic immigrants, selected through a points system that values\nskilled work, education and youth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBut behind the scenes of that 2022 announcement, the Canadian Press reported,\nfederal public servants had warned that rapid population growth could strain\nthe health-care system and housing affordability. Housing stock, they said,\nhad not kept pace with the population.\n\nHousing prices here are the highest in the G-7, according to data from the\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. For many millennials, once a key\ndemographic for Trudeau, homeownership feels increasingly out of reach.\n\nMuch of Canada\u2019s population growth is tied not to the number of permanent\nresidents, but to the skyrocketing number of temporary immigrants such as\ninternational students, adding to the pressures.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThere were more than 1 million international students here in 2023, up 245\npercent from a decade earlier and 60 percent since 2019. Canada, a country of\n40 million, had roughly the same number of international students last year as\nthe United States, a country more than eight times its size.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGovernments of all kinds have encouraged their arrival, said Lisa Brunner, a\npostdoctoral research fellow at the University of British Columbia, which \u201chad\na ripple effect because higher education and immigration got so intertwined.\u201d\n\nEveryone gets something from the arrangement. International students pay\nseveral times more in tuition than domestic students, a critical revenue\nsource for colleges and universities whose funding has been slashed by\nprovincial governments.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nInternational students, meanwhile, may apply for post-graduation work permits\nand eventually permanent resident status, a process called two-step\nimmigration.\n\nAnalysts say that while population growth has played a role, the roots of\nCanada\u2019s housing affordability crisis are complex and fall under the\njurisdiction of all levels of government, encompassing issues such as zoning\nrestrictions and shortages of skilled construction workers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn recent months, critics have called on the government to align immigration\nnumbers with the country\u2019s infrastructure. Immigration has benefits,\neconomists at the National Bank of Canada wrote in January, \u201cbut all good\nthings have their limits.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nImmigration Minister Marc Miller said last month that Canada would for the\nfirst time set targets for the number of temporary immigrants. He had already\nannounced a temporary cap on undergraduate study permits and increased the\namount of money that international students must have to study here.\n\nThe ministry also barred students in programs run by public-private college\npartnerships from applying for postgraduate work permits. Some, Miller said,\nrun \u201cthe diploma equivalent of puppy mills,\u201d offering poor curriculums in\nexchange for the prospect of permanent status.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the federal budget plan introduced this month, the government said the\nnumber of temporary residents is expected to fall by about 600,000, \u201cwhich\nwill result in a significant easing in demand across the housing market.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe proposal also includes measures to boost housing construction, some of\nwhich will require support from the provinces.\n\nLimiting temporary immigration \u201cwill help to alleviate some of the upward\npressure on rent,\u201d said Avery Shenfeld, a chief economist at the Canadian\nImperial Bank of Commerce. \u201cThe steps to accelerate home building will help in\nthe long run, but they\u2019ll take some time to kick in.\u201d\n\nMoffatt, who has advised the Trudeau government on housing, said it was caught\n\u201cflat-footed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think they should have put these changes in place about five years ago,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImmigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada said in a statement that it will\n\u201ccontinue to align immigration with housing capacity and labor market needs.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we must ensure robust pathways to permanent residence for\nthose who wish to make Canada their home in the long term, and avoid the\npitfalls of an economy built solely on temporary workers,\u201d said Jessica\nKingsbury, a department spokeswoman. \u201cImmigration is critical to Canada\u2019s\nlong-term success.\u201d\n\n###\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t see my future here anymore\u2019\n\nStudents at Conestoga College sipped on Tim Hortons and hung out in common\nareas at a campus in Kitchener, a city of 257,000 people an hour west of\nToronto. The halls were filled with the sounds of chit chat in Hindi, Punjabi\nand Mandarin.\n\nIn 2017, international students represented 20 percent of the public college\u2019s\n11,860 full-time students. \u201cIncreased international student tuition revenue\npositively impacted net financial results,\u201d the school said in an annual\nreport.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFull-time enrollment has since quadrupled to 45,000 students, most of them\nfrom abroad. In 2023, Conestoga had more than 30,000 international study\npermits approved \u2014 more than any other college or university in Canada.\n\nUnder the new changes to international study permits, this number will be cut\nby more than half.\n\nSimren Preetkaur started a two-year business diploma program here in\nSeptember. The Indian student said she has been following Ottawa\u2019s recent\nmoves.\n\n\u201cTo some extent, we agree with them,\u201d said Preetkaur, 20, \u201cbecause the\ncitizens, those who were living here earlier, are not getting the benefits.\u201d\n\nBrunner, who works with international students, said the situation is\ndifficult for many.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s really a lot of uncertainty about your future,\u201d she said. \u201cThis two-\nstep migration really positions people to compete in the labor market with no\nguarantees of permanent residency at the end, and I think that\u2019s been very\nstressful for individual students.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHardik Lathiya arrived in Canada from India\u2019s Gujarat state in January 2023 to\nstudy web development. It was \u201ctotally white\u201d with snow when he arrived, he\nsaid, and the wind was harsh.\n\nLathiya, 23, learned about Conestoga online. It had positive reviews, he said,\nand he was eager to gain some independence abroad.\n\nHis experience has been mixed. He has learned much but misses friends and\nfamily. He works part time at a restaurant but struggles to manage expenses.\nFinding affordable housing has also been a headache.\n\nAt first, Lathiya lived with five roommates, who shared three bedrooms. Now,\nhe lives with three roommates but still shares a bedroom. His monthly rent is\nroughly $430.\n\nHe plans to stay in Canada for a few years to work before returning to India.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see my future here anymore,\u201d Lathiya said. \u201cRight now, [life] is full\nof struggle.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nWorld news\n\nEssential reporting from around the world\n\nNestl\u00e9 adds more sugar to baby food in poorer countries, report finds\n\nAnalysis|Ukraine will get its U.S. funding.
