Our free web browser for\niOS, Android, Mac, and Windows lets you search and browse the web, but \u2014\nunlike Google Search and Chrome \u2014 we don\u2019t track your searches or browsing\nhistory, and we block other companies from trying to track you, all by\ndefault. Learn more.\n\nDuckDuckGo is an independent Google alternative that also lets you search and\nbrowse the web, but we don\u2019t track your searches or browsing history, and our\nbrowsers and extensions help block other companies from trying to track you as\nwell, all by default. Our browser comes with seamless privacy protection\nbuilt-in, including tracker blocking, increased encryption, Email Protection,\nand more. Learn more.\n\nDuckDuckGo never tracks you. And when you leave our search engine and use our\nbrowsers or extensions to visit other sites, we aim to protect your privacy as\nmuch as possible. No service can eliminate all hidden tracking or all\nprofiling online because trackers are always trying to evade specific\nprotections. To be effective, our protections continually evolve to mitigate\nthis while avoiding website breakage. That\u2019s also why we offer multiple types\nof web tracking protections.\n\nOther browsers offer some of these by default, like cookie and fingerprinting\nprotections, but we also provide many other protections that most browsers do\nnot offer by default, like 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection, Global\nPrivacy Control, Link Tracking Protection, CNAME Cloaking Protection, Google\nAMP Protection, and more, which all help cover different tracking angles. Our\nlist of trackers is open source, along with the list of exceptions we make to\npreserve usability. Learn more.\n\nWe don\u2019t track our users, so it\u2019s impossible for us to know how many people in\ntotal actually use our product. However, we can make an estimate based on the\nnumber of searches we get each month. Our best guess \u2014 over 100 million\npeople! Thanks to all these users, DuckDuckGo holds the #2 position in mobile\nsearch market share in the US, and 18 other markets including Australia,\nAustria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Malta, New\nZealand, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n\nWe make money from private ads on our search engine. On other search engines,\nads are based on profiles compiled from your personal information, such as\nsearch, browsing, and purchase history. Since we don\u2019t have that information\nper our Privacy Policy, search ads on DuckDuckGo are based on the search\nresults page you\u2019re viewing instead of being based on who other companies and\ntheir tracking algorithms assume you are as a person. For example, if you\nsearch for cars, we\u2019ll show you ads about cars. We also make money from the\nsubscription fee that users pay to access Privacy Pro, our three-in-one\nsubscription service. Learn more.\n\nUse DuckDuckGo to get more privacy online. Ever see ads so creepy it feels\nlike your phone is listening to you? Or notice ads following you around for\nsomething you searched for once? If you\u2019re wondering who to blame, it\u2019s\nprobably Google. For decades, Google has been tracking your searches,\nembedding trackers in the Chrome browser, and hiding even more trackers on the\nmost-popular websites.\n\nIn contrast, our browser lets you search and browse like you\u2019re used to, but\n(unlike Google) we never track you and our browser helps block Google\u2019s\ntrackers and those from other companies that operate other online tracking\nnetworks like TikTok and Meta (Facebook).\n\nUse DuckDuckGo to get a better online experience. Have you noticed Google\nsearch results getting worse? You\u2019re not alone. For many Google searches, most\nof the results on the first page are either ads or Google pushing their own\nservices. It can be even worse on mobile.\n\nOn DuckDuckGo, we keep ads to a minimum and our search ads are private, only\nbased on the search results page you\u2019re viewing, and not on you as a person.\nThe tracker blocking that\u2019s built-in to our browser also blocks a large number\nof tracker-dependent ads from loading by default. Coupled with other browser\nfeatures like automatically blocking cookie pop-ups, our default web tracking\nprotections give you a cleaner online experience overall with DuckDuckGo.\n\nUse DuckDuckGo to send a message to Big Tech companies like Google who are\ntaking away user choice online and profiting by stealing your personal\ninformation. Google is the epitome of Big Tech, with their tentacles in\neverything, compiling detailed profiles about everyone, and making billions of\ndollars auctioning off access to your attention, for what? Creepy ads that\nfollow you around? By comparison, DuckDuckGo is a small, independent company,\nbased in Paoli, Pennsylvania, with a vision to offer a choice to be more\nprivate online without sacrifice to anyone who wants it.\n\nUse DuckDuckGo because it\u2019s fast and secure, because it\u2019s a free Google\nalternative that lets you search and browse the way you want, and because it\nputs you back in control of your personal data.\n\nNo. It is a myth that you can't be tracked while using so-called \u201cIncognito\u201d\nmode. In fact, all Incognito mode really does is delete information on your\ncomputer. Incognito mode does nothing to stop Google from saving your\nsearches, nor does it stop companies, Internet service providers, or\ngovernments from being able to track you online. By contrast, DuckDuckGo\nSearch never keeps your or anyone else's search history and the DuckDuckGo\nbrowser helps keep you private on websites too. Learn more.\n\nDuckDuckGo Search gives you truly private search results without tradeoffs in\nresult quality. We have everything you\u2019ve come to expect in an online search\nexperience (images, maps, answers, etc.), and because there\u2019s no search\nhistory on DuckDuckGo, you escape the filter bubble of manipulated results.\nYou\u2019ll also find bonus features that make our private search engine more\nconvenient and a little more fun. We\u2019re always improving, so you can expect\neven more search improvements in the coming year! Learn more.\n\nNo, we are not and have never been owned by Google or any other entity. We\nhave been an independent company since our founding in 2008. We also do not\nsource any of our search results from Google. You may notice that we offer a\nGoogle Chrome extension and a Google Android app, but these are also not in\npartnership with Google and actually aim to protect you from Google\u2019s online\ntrackers. Learn more.\n\n## About DuckDuckGo\n\nDuckDuckGo is the independent Internet privacy company for anyone who\u2019s tired\nof being tracked online and wants an easy solution. Unlike Chrome and other\nbrowsers, our free, go-to browser comes with over a dozen powerful privacy\nprotections built-in, including our search engine that replaces Google and\ndoesn't track your search history.
