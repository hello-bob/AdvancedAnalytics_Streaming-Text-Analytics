But activists put the pressure on to ensure that Disney goes\nall-EV with the ride, and fast.\n\nLate Thursday, those activists got their wish, and Disney announced that it\nwould go all-electric with the ride within the next 30 months.\n\nAt first, Disney\u2019s statement sounded a little noncommittal and open \u2013 they\ndidn\u2019t state a specific timeline, nor specify that the ride would be all-\nelectric. So activists wanted to ensure that both of these things happened.\n\nAnd late Thursday, Disney spokesperson Jessica Good told the LA Times that\nelectrification \u201cmeans fully electric \u2014 it does not mean hybrid or any other\nversion of a gasoline combustion engine,\u201d and that the park \u201cwill no longer be\nusing the current engines within the next 30 months.\u201d\n\nAutopia is a classic ride in Disneyland\u2019s \u201cTomorrowland\u201d area, but given the\nEV world we\u2019re living in, its current stinky gas-powered cars certainly don\u2019t\nseem too futuristic.\n\nThe emissions from these engines cause smog and harm the health of those who\nbreathe them \u2013 so putting them directly in front of small children isn\u2019t the\nbest idea. But the ride was sponsored by Chevron from 1998-2012, and that\ncompany is pretty dedicated to poisoning small children anyway, so it was apt.\n\nThankfully, in 2012, Disney attracted a new sponsor, Honda, and in 2016, Honda\nupgraded the engines for greater efficiency. However, the cars still create\nplenty of exhaust noise and smell, which is still poisonous to the children\nriding behind these polluting engines. It\u2019s also poisonous to employees, to\nthe point where Disney pays hazard pay to employees who are assigned to staff\nthe ride.\n\n2016 was also notably after EVs had proven themselves in the automotive realm.\nSo upgrading to an old technology seems a little inappropriate for\n\u201cTomorrowland.\u201d But Honda themselves have been behind the ball on the EV\ntransition as well.\n\nTomorrowland is the section within Disneyland which was meant to show visions\nof the future. It first opened in 1955, and offers a time capsule of what a\n1950s vision of the future might have looked like.\n\nNeedless to say, in the seven decades hence, things have changed somewhat. To\nthe point where the original designer of the Autopia cars, Bob Gurr, who is\nnow 92 and was interviewed by the LA Times, said \u201cget rid of those God-awful\ngasoline fumes.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s certainly ironic that in California, where EVs keep setting sales records\nand where you can\u2019t even buy gas-powered \u201csmall off-road engines\u201d anymore, a\nDisneyland parkgoer might drive to the park in a clean EV, only to show their\nchildren a vision of the past with a poisonous, low-performing gas engine on\none of the admittedly more-fun rides in the park. Just imagine how much more\nfun the ride will be when it goes electric.\n\n## Top comment by JoshB\n\nLiked by 13 people\n\nDisney still hasn't converted parking lot trams to electric or the buses that\ntake people between resorts/hotels & parks... both of those operating from\nearly morning to late at night every day so a much bigger opportunity that\nnoone seems to address..\n\nThey could fast charge buses for 5+ mins while (un)loading at each park.\nElectric trams could likely run all day & charge overnight given the short\ndistance.\n\nView all comments\n\nAnd Disney could do a lot more to update Tomorrowland with actual visions of\nthe future, rather than an old-timey time capsule. The original Tomorrowland\nfeatured a \u201cCarousel of Progress\u201d show of futuristic efficient home\nappliances, and the Monorail and PeopleMover which both still exist. Disney\ncould showcase more public transport or other post-car mobility options, ideas\nfor futuristic city planning, induction cooktops and more.\n\nBut for now, making Autopia electric seems like a great first step.\n\nTo this end, local EV advocates and Plug In America are hosting a rally to\ncelebrate Disney\u2019s decision this Sunday, April 21 at 10am at Walt Disney\nStudios in Burbank. Not a bad way to spend Earth Day weekend, perhaps after\nattending one of the LA-area Drive Electric Earth Month events the day before\n(and one of the founders of Drive Electric Week, Zan Dubin-Scott, is\norganizing the Burbank rally). The rally was originally planned to put\npressure on Disney to go all-EV, but in light of yesterday\u2019s announcement, it\nhas now turned into a celebration.\n\nThis article is updated from a previous version of the article which described\nthe pressure being put on Disney to go all-electric. Not long after that\narticle was posted, Disney clarified that it\u2019s planning to go all-EV.\n\nAdd Electrek to your Google News feed.\n\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
