In short,\nexperts believe the thesis to invest in Tesla has shifted in recent months.\nWhile it initially appealed to an investor attracted to Tesla\u2019s central\nelectric vehicle business, it is now more attractive to someone who believes\nin the company\u2019s long-term bid on artificial intelligence, or the carmaker\u2019s\nability to make a major breakthrough in its ambitious robotaxi program, which\nwould set a ride-hailing fleet of self-driving Tesla cars onto the road. It\u2019s\nreasonable to think Tesla can pull this off, considering it grew its EV\ndeliveries from 50,000 cars in 2015 to 1.8 million last year while maintaining\nincredible capital discipline. But the timeline to stick the landing is far\nlonger than the timeline many investors are comfortable with. To illustrate,\nDeutsche Bank analysts projected this week that robotaxis could bring in $15\nbillion in gross profits for Tesla by the end of the decade, but addressing\nthat opportunity will require solving \u201csignificant technological, regulatory\nand operational challenges.\u201d\n\n## Surprising Fact\n\nExxonMobil overtook Tesla in market cap Friday, a symbolic passing of the\ntorch from the most valuable renewable energy car company to the U.S.\u2019 largest\noil company. At its 2021 peak, Tesla was valued about $955 billion higher than\nExxonMobil.\n\n## Key Background\n\nTesla has underperformed the S&P on basically any timeframe dating back to the\nbeginning of 2021, but its returns are significantly better than the broader\nmarket for those who got in before the company\u2019s meteoric rise close to the\nonset of the Covid-19 pandemic. As Tesla\u2019s stock market troubles escalated, so\ndid drama involving Musk, who notoriously bought the social media platform\nthen known as Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, selling off billions of dollars\nof Tesla shares to do so, undertaking various controversial changes at the\nsite and increasingly wading into political issues rarely discussed by\nexecutives of his standing. Musk\u2019s $181 billion net worth is nearly $140\nbillion lower Friday than it was at its 2021 apex of $320 billion, though he\nremains the third-richest person in the world, according to Forbes\u2019\ncalculations. Musk is by far Tesla\u2019s largest individual shareholder at 13%,\nthough a compensation package up for shareholder vote would enable him to up\nhis stake to 22%.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.
