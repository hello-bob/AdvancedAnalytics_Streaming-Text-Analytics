A new method pinpoints\nhow\n\nby Mariana Noto Guillen, The Conversation\n\nCredit: Unsplash/CC0 Public Domain\n\nHuman history was forever changed with the discovery of antibiotics in 1928.\nInfectious diseases such as pneumonia, tuberculosis and sepsis were widespread\nand lethal until penicillin made them treatable. Surgical procedures that once\ncame with a high risk of infection became safer and more routine. Antibiotics\nmarked a triumphant moment in science that transformed medical practice and\nsaved countless lives.\n\nBut antibiotics have an inherent caveat: When overused, bacteria can evolve\nresistance to these drugs. The World Health Organization estimated that these\nsuperbugs caused 1.27 million deaths around the world in 2019 and will likely\nbecome an increasing threat to global public health in the coming years.\n\nNew discoveries are helping scientists face this challenge in innovative ways.\nStudies have found that nearly a quarter of drugs that aren't normally\nprescribed as antibiotics, such as medications used to treat cancer, diabetes\nand depression, can kill bacteria at doses typically prescribed for people.\n\nUnderstanding the mechanisms underlying how certain drugs are toxic to\nbacteria may have far-reaching implications for medicine. If nonantibiotic\ndrugs target bacteria in different ways from standard antibiotics, they could\nserve as leads in developing new antibiotics. But if nonantibiotics kill\nbacteria in similar ways to known antibiotics, their prolonged use, such as in\nthe treatment of chronic disease, might inadvertently promote antibiotic\nresistance.\n\nIn our recently published research, my colleagues and I developed a new\nmachine learning method that not only identified how nonantibiotics kill\nbacteria but can also help find new bacterial targets for antibiotics.\n\n## New ways of killing bacteria\n\nNumerous scientists and physicians around the world are tackling the problem\nof drug resistance, including me and my colleagues in the Mitchell Lab at\nUMass Chan Medical School. We use the genetics of bacteria to study which\nmutations make bacteria more resistant or more sensitive to drugs.\n\nWhen my team and I learned about the widespread antibacterial activity of\nnonantibiotics, we were consumed by the challenge it posed: figuring out how\nthese drugs kill bacteria.\n\nTo answer this question, I used a genetic screening technique my colleagues\nrecently developed to study how anticancer drugs target bacteria. This method\nidentifies which specific genes and cellular processes change when bacteria\nmutate. Monitoring how these changes influence the survival of bacteria allows\nresearchers to infer the mechanisms these drugs use to kill bacteria.\n\nI collected and analyzed almost 2 million instances of toxicity between 200\ndrugs and thousands of mutant bacteria. Using a machine learning algorithm I\ndeveloped to deduce similarities between different drugs, I grouped the drugs\ntogether in a network based on how they affected the mutant bacteria.\n\nMy maps clearly showed that known antibiotics were tightly grouped together by\ntheir known classes of killing mechanisms. For example, all antibiotics that\ntarget the cell wall\u2014the thick protective layer surrounding bacterial\ncells\u2014were grouped together and well separated from antibiotics that interfere\nwith bacteria's DNA replication.\n\nIntriguingly, when I added nonantibiotic drugs to my analysis, they formed\nseparate hubs from antibiotics. This indicates that nonantibiotic and\nantibiotic drugs have different ways of killing bacterial cells. While these\ngroupings don't reveal how each drug specifically kills antibiotics, they show\nthat those clustered together likely work in similar ways.\n\nThe last piece of the puzzle\u2014whether we could find new drug targets in\nbacteria to kill them\u2014came from the research of my colleague Carmen Li. She\ngrew hundreds of generations of bacteria that were exposed to different\nnonantibiotic drugs normally prescribed to treat anxiety, parasite infections\nand cancer. Sequencing the genomes of bacteria that evolved and adapted to the\npresence of these drugs allowed us to pinpoint the specific bacterial protein\nthat triclabendazole\u2014a drug used to treat parasite infections\u2014targets to kill\nthe bacteria. Importantly, current antibiotics don't typically target this\nprotein.\n\nAdditionally, we found that two other nonantibiotics that used a similar\nmechanism as triclabendazole also target the same protein. This demonstrated\nthe power of my drug similarity maps to identify drugs with similar killing\nmechanisms, even when that mechanism was yet unknown.\n\n## Helping antibiotic discovery\n\nOur findings open multiple opportunities for researchers to study how\nnonantibiotic drugs work differently from standard antibiotics. Our method of\nmapping and testing drugs also has the potential to address a critical\nbottleneck in developing antibiotics.\n\nSearching for new antibiotics typically involves sinking considerable\nresources into screening thousands of chemicals that kill bacteria and\nfiguring out how they work. Most of these chemicals are found to work\nsimilarly to existing antibiotics and are discarded.\n\nOur work shows that combining genetic screening with machine learning can help\nuncover the chemical needle in the haystack that can kill bacteria in ways\nresearchers haven't used before. There are different ways to kill bacteria we\nhaven't exploited yet, and there are still roads we can take to fight the\nthreat of bacterial infections and antibiotic resistance.\n\nProvided by The Conversation\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons\nlicense.
