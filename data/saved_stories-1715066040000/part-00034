For the essay about flogging a dead\nhorse, see WP:STICK. For the animal, see WP:EQUINE.\n\nThis is an explanatory essay about the Wikipedia:Verifiability page.This page\nprovides additional information about concepts in the page(s) it supplements.\nThis page is not one of Wikipedia's policies or guidelines as it has not been\nthoroughly vetted by the community.| Shortcut\n\n  * WP:LEGS\n\n  \n---|---  \n  \nExplanatory essay about the Wikipedia:Verifiability page\n\nThis page contains material that is kept because it is considered humorous.\nSuch material is not meant to be taken seriously.  \n---  \nThis page in a nutshell: Simply saying that a horse has five legs doesn't make\nit true \u2013 calling a horse's tail a leg does not make it one.  \n---  \nIt still has four legs.\n\nJack and the Five Legged Horse\n\nMy uncle once said, \"Boy, do you see that horse?\"\n\n    Yessir.\n\n\"How many legs does that horse have?\"\n\n    Four.\n\n\"Now what if I say that a horse's tail is a leg, too?\"\n\n    Uh...\n\n\"If I call a horse's tail a leg, how many legs does that horse have?\"\n\n    Five?\n\n\"Boy, will you never learn? It doesn't matter what you call something. That\nhorse still has four legs.\"^[1]\n\nSometimes when confronted with a difficult challenge we reply, That's not\ntrue! We say, That's not a (vanity COI page)/(rant)/(personal attack)/(tail);\nthat's a (noteworthy article)/(discussion)/(polite comment)/(leg). But this\nchanges nothing.\n\nIt's never enough to reply to a comment by saying You're wrong! That's not\ntrue! If it really is a leg, then show us how.\n\nWhen arguing, make sure you add really new legs to your stand.\n\n## My uncle was right ...[edit]\n\nTHERE! Now the horse has no legs!!!\n\n### Very well, you say it does not have five legs: I say it has nine![edit]\n\n  1. No horse has five legs.\n  2. Any horse has four legs more than no horse does.\n  3. Therefore, a horse has nine legs.\n\n### A horse has, in fact, an infinite number of legs[edit]\n\n  1. We first must establish that horses have an even number of legs \u2013 yes?\n  2. A horse has forelegs and hind legs.\n  3. It has two hind legs.\n  4. Fore plus two hind is six, thus it has six legs\n  5. Six is an odd number of legs for a horse to have\n  6. But the number must also be even!\n  7. The only number which is both even and odd is infinity (note: strictly speaking, infinity is not a number but...)\n  8. Therefore, a horse has an infinite number of legs\n\n### The longer you count, the more legs a horse has[edit]\n\n  1. A horse has four legs\n  2. Also, it has two forelegs at the front and two hind legs in the back. This makes it 8.\n  3. It has two legs on the left side and two legs on the right side. This totals 12.\n  4. It also has four perfectly visible legs from below. Now we have 16 of them.\n  5. And we haven't even started counting legs on each corner!\n\n## Beating a dead horse[edit]\n\nA picture can be worth a thousand words...\n\nSome editors are so convinced that the horse has five legs that they will\ncontinue to return to the issue long after everybody else has accepted the\nconsensus view that horses have four legs. Many of the most dedicated\nproponents of the five-leg school will assert that fivelegism is as valid a\nview as fourlegism, and that fourlegism is only a point of view. Often they\nwill continue this to the point where they are, in truth, beating the bloody\nmark where the dead horse once lay.\n\n## On the other hoof...[edit]\n\nIf someone is writing about a horse that has five legs then, as tedious and\nboring as it may be, it is a good idea to check the references and reasons\nthey have written about it. It may just be there was a genetic manipulation,\nor surgical graft, or something else altogether. Just because the only horses\nyou have encountered have had four legs, doesn't mean that a five legged horse\nmight not exist.^[2] Some deer have five legs.^[3]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Logical fallacy\n  * Wikipedia:You are probably not a lexicologist or a lexicographer\n  * Wikipedia:Call a spade a spade\n  * Wikipedia:Drop the stick and back slowly away from the horse carcass\n  * Wikipedia:Insignificant\n  * User:Jnc/Astronomer vs Amateur\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Hardcastle, Joseph (1883). \"Criticisms on \"A Criticism on Averaging Accounts.\"\".
