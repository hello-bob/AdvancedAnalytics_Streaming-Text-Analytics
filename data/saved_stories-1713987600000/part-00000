This open-source\nplatform is geared towards robotics and navigation applications, equipped with\na 5MP camera and Lidar support for an array of programmable functionalities.\n\nSimilar to the Waveshare RaspRover covered in March, this platform uses a\ndual-controller design with the Raspberry Pi 4B/5 as its primary host\ncontroller for AI and vision tasks, while the ESP32 sub-controller manages\nsensor data processing and real-time operations.\n\n\u2014 ADVERTISEMENT \u2014\n\nThe kits vary primarily by the inclusion of a pan-tilt module and the presence\nof the host controller. The pan-tilt module equipped kits come with additional\nhigh-torque servos.\n\nUGV Rover host controller & sub-controller (click image to enlarge)\n\nFeaturing a robust 2mm aluminum body and 80mm shock-absorbing rubber tires,\nthe UGV Rover is designed for stability and durability. Its 6-wheel drive\nsystem enhances maneuverability, and a versatile mounting plate supports add-\nons like LIDAR.\n\nThe sub-controller\u2019s high-frequency PID closed-loop speed control enables\nswift and precise movement, achieving speeds of up to 0.5m/s. The pan-tilt\nversion, slightly larger and heavier, incorporates additional high-torque\nservos for expanded functionality.\n\nUGV Rover host other features (click image to enlarge)\n\nA 5MP wide-angle camera is central to the UGV Rover\u2019s vision capabilities,\nsupporting OpenCV and MediaPipe integrations for complex vision processing\ntasks such as object and gesture recognition.\n\nDesigned to operate with 18650 lithium batteries, the UGV Rover includes a UPS\nModule for continuous power supply. Its energy management system ensures that\nthe platform can sustain extended operational periods.\n\nThe platform is equipped with an audio driver board and dual-track speakers\nfor interactive audio feedback. It supports text-to-speech and audio playback,\nessential for user interaction and alerts.\n\nUGV Rover Motor & Audio Driver board (click image to enlarge)\n\nRemote operation is facilitated through a web application, compatible with\nstandard browsers, which provides for high-frame-rate video transmission and\nAI-enhanced computer vision functionalities.\n\nWaveshare mentions they will provide tutorials of Ngrok only, but they won\u2019t\nprovide any Ngrok accounts or Servers.\n\nFor inter-robot communication, the ESP-NOW protocol enables low-latency\ninteractions without the need for IP or MAC addresses, while the design also\nallows for 4G/5G module expansions.\n\nWaveShare UGB Rover kit (click image to enlarge)\n\nThe product specifications state that the rover is compatible with Debian\nBookworm and ROS2-HUMBLE-LTS, and it also supports JupyterLab. Although\nWaveshare promises to offer multiple examples to assist with getting started,\nthe Wiki page for these resources is not available as of the publication date.\n\nFurther information:\n\nThe UGV Rover PI4B AI Kit and the UGV Rover PI5 AI Kit are priced at $294.99\neach; this price does not include the Raspberry Pi 4 and features a pan-tilt\nmodule with a US power plug. Similar configurations that exclude the pan-tilt\nmodule, the cost is reduced to $244.99.
