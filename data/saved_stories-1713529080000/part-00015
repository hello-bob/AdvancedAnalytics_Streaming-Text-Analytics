It builds on a point I made at the end of\nmy last presentation. ISOJ is an awesome conference, drawing a great mix of\njournalists and academics from South and North America and chaired by the\ninimitable Rosental Alves. My talk was part of a broader discussion of AI for\njournalism with an inspiring set of panelists. What follows are the slides and\nscript from my portion of the panel. You can find the video here.\n\nOnce upon a time there was ChatGPT, and people had a lot of fun with it. You\ncould use it to write poems, formal emails, or a pitch for a Bravo reality\nshow about the bats that live underneath Congress Avenue Bridge.\n\nWhat couldn\u2019t generative AI do? Write this whole presentation for me at the\nlast minute with a Poe bot. (Kidding.) Create an inspiring pop rock ballad\nabout Rosental with Suno. (Find me later, and I'll play it for you.) It can be\na blast.\n\n  1. A fundamental misunderstanding\n  2. The common element\n  3. Structuring the city council\n  4. Structuring the mayor\n  5. AI hews toward structure\n  6. Structuring your receipts\n\n## A fundamental misunderstanding\n\nBut a year later, it seems clear that introducing the world to generative AI\nthrough parlor tricks created some distorted impressions of what the\ntechnology is good for\u2014or, at least, what it's best at. How many of you have\nstared at a powerful LLM tool like this one, the cursor in an empty text box\nblinking menacingly as you wonder, good question, how can you help me today?\n\nYou\u2019re not alone. AI apps, though popular, suffer from lots of users who try a\nparlor trick\u2014write the first page of my novel, sure\u2014and then never return.\n\nJust 14% of monthly users of AI apps are daily users, according to one\nanalysis, compared to 51% for popular apps like games and social-media\nplatforms.\n\nI\u2019d like to think that\u2019s due, in part, to a fundamental misunderstanding. I\nmean, generation, it\u2019s right there in the name, so I get the confusion. But\ngenerative AI\u2019s most powerful use is not in creating entirely new text or\nimages, it\u2019s creating structure out of messy data that already exist.\n\n## The common element\n\nThis is building on a point I made briefly at the end of my last public talk,\nhere in Austin at SXSW last month, where I shared some examples of journalists\nusing generative AI to create structure out of unstructured prose:\n\n  * The Marshall Project\u2019s banned-books database that Andrew Rodriguez Calder\u00f3n will talk about in more detail shortly;\n  * a custom GPT by Jaemark Tordecilla that parses complex government audit reports to help expose corruption in the Philippines;\n  * and a product recommendation site generated by intelligently mining links in the archives of the newsletter \u201cWhy is this interesting?\u201d\n\nThe common element in each of those generative-AI projects is that they aren't\nreally generating something new. They're creating summaries, extracting\ninformation, and structuring data in a more usable form.\n\nToday I\u2019d like to build on that argument with a few other examples.\n\n## Structuring the city council\n\nOn March 11, New York City\u2019s committee on general welfare held a nearly six-\nhour meeting at which several important issues we\u2019re discussed: funding cuts\nfor homeless shelters and rental-assistance programs, backlogs in applications\nfor food stamps, the city's response to migrants seeking asylum, etc.\n\nBut if you went to the city council's website to find a record of the meeting,\nyou wouldn\u2019t know any of that. You\u2019d be starting at a page like this one,\nwondering if this really how the nation\u2019s largest city operates in 2024.\n\nVikram Oberoi, an engineer in New York with an interest in local government,\nthought there had to be a better way.\n\nThe city council does publish transcripts and video recordings of its\nmeetings, if you can find them. Oberoi wrote detailed prompts for GPT-4 to\nbreak up the transcript into timestamped question-and-answer pairs he called\nchapters, give each chapter a helpful title, and summarize the salient points\nof the discussion.\n\nAnd so Oberoi had all the structured data he needed to create a far more\naccessible version of the same meeting: navigable by chapter, with helpful\nsummaries, and the video synced to the transcript.\n\nNot just for that meeting of the committee on general welfare, but every city\ncouncil meeting since he started this project a few months ago. What a\nwonderful contribution to civic engagement and local journalism.\n\n## Structuring the mayor\n\nGive it some thought, and you will find plenty of ways to use this approach to\nyour advantage as a journalist.\n\nA colleague of mine at The Times covering immigration was frustrated by New\nYork\u2019s habit of releasing important statistics ad hoc in the middle of City\nHall press conferences. So he gave the transcripts to an LLM and asked it to\nspit out all the statistics. It gave him a kind of Harper\u2019s Index of each\npress conference.\n\nThat\u2019s a really simple prompt anyone here could employ without a lick of code.\nAnd, yes, you should fact-check these data if you plan to publish them, but in\nmy experience, LLMs are very good at this kind of task and far less likely to\ninvent information than when generating text out of whole cloth. Another\nreason creating structure is the best LLM use case.\n\n## AI hews toward structure\n\nReal life is messy. Journalism, at its best, helps people make sense of that\nmess. Using AI to give structure to messy data is a pure form of journalism.\n\nThe neural networks underlying large language models can seem like enigmas.\n\nWhat you\u2019re looking at on screen is not just what you might see after wild a\nnight on Sixth Street, it\u2019s a visualization of training a neural network,\nwhich even amid mysterious calculations over vast arrays of data, produces\ngorgeous fractals. AI hews toward structure, it loves structure. It\u2019s not\nrandom.\n\n## Structuring your receipts\n\nOne last example. I\u2019ve been talking mostly about creating structure out of\ntext, but there\u2019s just as much potential in creating structure from images.\n\nA lot of you are traveling here from out of town at your employer\u2019s expense,\nwhich means lots of receipts like this one and a painful data-entry process\nwhen you get home. Well, next time, try feeding your receipts to your favorite\nmultimodal LLM and asking for the data you need.\n\nThe most beautiful kind of structure out of chaos.
