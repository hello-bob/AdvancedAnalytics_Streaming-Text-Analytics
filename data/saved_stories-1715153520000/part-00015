Kearns turned the wipers on low.\nIn those days, even the most advanced wipers had just two settings, one for\nsteady rain and one for heavy rain; in a mizzling rain, they screeched back\nand forth across the glass, mesmerizing the driver, and occasionally causing\naccidents. Kearns\u2019 vision was already impaired as a result of an accident nine\nyears earlier, when, on his wedding night, he was hit in the left eye by a\nflying champagne cork. Now, straining to see through the windshield, half\nthinking about his lousy wipers and half thinking about his bad eye, Kearns\nhad what the Wall Street Journal later called \u201cthe kind of inspiration that\nseparates inventors from ordinary people.\u201d He thought, Why can\u2019t a wiper work\nmore like an eyelid? Why can\u2019t it blink? The idea for the intermittent\nwindshield wiper entered his mind.\n\nSometime this year, a little more than three decades after his good idea came\nto him, Kearns will go to trial in a suit he has brought against General\nMotors. Kearns, who is sixty-five years old, has already defeated Ford and\nChrysler in court, and he stands to collect more than twenty million dollars\nfrom them for infringing his patents on the intermittent windshield wiper.\nAfter the G.M. trial, Kearns will start on foreign automakers, beginning with\nFerrari, and working his way through virtually the entire automobile industry\nworldwide. His remarkable success has made him one of the most famous\ninventors in the country, a hero to thousands of inventors with their own\npatent-infringement horror stories to tell. To others, he is a barnacle that\nhas fastened itself to the underside of our patent system so tenaciously that\nthe most powerful corporations in the world cannot pry it off.\n\nKearns is a small man, a few inches taller than elfin. His voice is high,\nnasal, and toneless, and his shoulders are stooped, perhaps from years of\npeering down at patent texts. His skin is pinkish, and his hair is startlingly\nwhite. According to Dennis, his oldest son, it turned white all at once, in\n1976, when Kearns took apart an intermittent-windshield-wiper apparatus made\nby Mercedes and discovered that the great German carmaker had apparently\ninfringed his wiper patents, too.\n\nKearns represented himself against Chrysler, and will do so again against G.M.\nHis offices, Kearns Associates, are directly across the street from the\nDetroit federal courthouse, where his cases are tried. He can usually be found\nat his desk, half hidden behind heaps of motions and countermotions and books\non trial procedure. The Associates are mainly Kearns\u2019 family. He has six\nchildren, and the lawsuit has become the dominant event in their lives\u2014and now\ntheir children are growing up with the case. The family is close, and the\nlawsuit has brought them closer. Four of his children have worked or are\nworking full time for their father. The case is what they do. None of them\nhave any legal training. They have learned on the job to write briefs, service\ndocuments, and deal with maneuvers pulled on them by the hundreds of lawyers\nworking for the Big Three. \u201cFor the kids, the lawsuit is all we\u2019ve ever\nknown,\u201d says Kearns\u2019 daughter Kathy, who is thirty-one. \u201cI mean, for us this\nis normal.\u201d\n\nThere is widespread feeling in patent departments of corporations around the\ncountry that Kearns\u2019 case represents a frightening precedent. A California\ninventor named Gilbert Hyatt, who was recently granted a basic patent on the\nmicroprocessor, is the latest example of the trend. In theory, Hyatt has\nbillions coming to him from the dozens of corporations that use\nmicroprocessors. \u201cThis kind of stuff makes people who work for corporations\nvery nervous,\u201d Marty Adelman, a law professor and patent expert at Wayne State\nUniversity, says. \u201cThe story today is not the big company screwing the little\nguy but the little guy screwing the big company. It\u2019s getting easier and\neasier for the little guy to do it.\u201d\n\nThe United States patent system is designed for the independent inventor\u2014for\nthe person whom Nikola Tesla described as \u201cthe lone worker who follows the\nfleeting inspiration of a moment and finally does something that has not been\ndone before.\u201d Two hundred years ago, when Thomas Jefferson created our patent\nsystem, all inventors were independent. Now most inventors work in huge\ncorporate research centers. Individuals surrender their ideas to the\ncorporation, and for doing so they receive regular salaries. But the patent\nsystem, together with the law that has accrued around it, still rests on the\neighteenth-century idea of the inventor, and in court a lone inventor with a\npatent is a formidable opponent for any corporation to face. \u201cI read all the\npatent cases, and rarely has there been a case in the last five years where\nthe corporation has beaten an independent inventor,\u201d Adelman says. \u201cI tell all\nthe corporate people who call me to testify against individuals, \u2018Jesus, guys,\nyou\u2019re up against it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe most frightening thing about Kearns, from the automobile companies\u2019 point\nof view, is that he is not particularly interested in money. He wants justice.\n\u201cThey think they can pay me thirty million dollars and put me on a park\nbench,\u201d he says. \u201cWell, Bob Kearns is not somebody\u2019s lackey.\u201d When I first met\nhim, a few months after he received ten million dollars from Ford, he was\nliving by himself in a small, dark unfurnished apartment in Houston. A\nsleeping bag was on the floor, and boxes of legal documents were everywhere\u2014on\nthe floor, on the kitchen counters, stacked on the toilet. He has since bought\na Colonial house and some property on the eastern shore of Maryland (it\u2019s\nright next to a house owned by Mario Boyardee, the canned-spaghetti heir), but\nhe hardly ever goes there. He sleeps on friends\u2019 couches around Detroit, or on\nthe floor of his office. He says he simply wants to make windshield wipers.\nThat is all he has ever wanted. He will go on suing until automobile companies\naround the world are stopped from manufacturing his wiper, and he can make it\nhimself.\n\nThe United States Patent and Trademark Office is in Crystal City, a government\ndevelopment in Arlington, Virginia. The buildings are glass and steel, and\nsleek, in the modern federal style, and the place has a sort of splendid\nisolation about it which goes nicely with being the city of invention. On the\nground floor of the Patent Office is the Search Room, a vast space filled with\npatents. The Patent Office has the largest collection of patents in the world.\nHere or upstairs, in the library, are Balinese patents and Manchurian patents,\nand English patents dating back to 1623. There are German dyestuff patents\nthat were confiscated by the United States during the First World War and\nbecame part of the foundation of the American chemical industry. More than\nfive million United States patents have been issued since 1790, when the first\none went to Samuel Hopkins, of Pittsford, Vermont, for a new way of making\npotash, and they are all stored here, in paper form, stacked face up in an\nimmense lattice of metal cubbyholes\u2014about a hundred bright ideas to each\ncubby, and thousands of inspirations to each long, dark row. Feathery dust\nlies on some of the older patents. Patent searchers can be found in the\naisles, scouring their fingertips lightly together to remove the dust, and\nplucking flakes of rotting patents from their jackets and sweaters.\n\nA graph of the fall and rise in the popularity of patents over the last\nhundred years would look like this: U. Having weathered a long siege of anti-\nmonopoly sentiment in the middle of this century, patents are now almost as\npopular as they were in the eighteen-nineties. Last year, the Patent Office\nreceived 185,446 patent applications, more than in any previous year, and\n109,728 patents were granted, almost twice as many as a decade ago. The Patent\nOffice cites these numbers as evidence that the spirit of Edison and Bell is\nalive, that America is as innovative as ever. This may be true. It is\ncertainly true that patents are more valuable than they used to be.\n\nOne reason is the influence of a new patent court, the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Federal Circuit, which was created in 1982 in part to hear all\npatent appeals. Before that, patent appeals went to circuit courts of appeal.\nMost judges despise patent cases. A patent case can tie up a judge\u2019s calendar\nfor months, sometimes for years, and often involves technical issues that the\njudge doesn\u2019t understand. Also, patent law is maddeningly subjective and\nimprecise, and apt to plunge all but the stoutest minds into dizzying swirls\nof logic. In a patent case a judge is asked to dissect the indivisible stream\nthat is technical progress, to say where one man\u2019s inspiration ends and\nanother\u2019s begins. For these reasons, circuit judges tended to dismiss patents\nas invalid simply to get rid of the cases. Between 1950 and 1975, three out of\nevery four patents in the circuit courts were ruled invalid or not infringed.\nCertain circuits were notorious for their hostility toward patents: in the\nEighth Circuit, almost no patents were held valid. The federal circuit court\nwas created to bring fairness and logic to the system, and most people agree\nthat it has. It has also dramatically increased the value of patents. The\ncourt has found three out of every four patents valid or infringed. Of eleven\njudges who sit on the court, five are former patent attorneys, so they are\ninclined to be more sympathetic to patents than most people are. In the\nfederal circuit, patents are held to be valid until proved otherwise, and not\nthe other way around.\n\nVideo From The New Yorker\n\nIn the last decade or so, the boundaries of what is patentable have expanded.\nIn 1972, a molecular engineer named Ananda Chakrabarty applied for a patent on\na microbe he had engineered that would help break down crude oil. The Patent\nOffice rejected his application, citing a clause in the patent code which says\nthat life forms are not patentable. Chakrabarty appealed, and in 1980 the\nSupreme Court ruled in his favor, 5\u20134, creating a brand-new sector of\nintellectual property: life. Last February, the National Institutes of Health\napplied for thousands of patents on human genes. The prospect that the United\nStates government may soon own the gene that causes, say, green eyes has\nnaturally created a certain amount of controversy, with some people predicting\na kind of land grab at the cellular level\u2014the Japanese patenting brown eyes,\nSwedes patenting blond hair, Italians patenting Roman noses.\n\nIndependent inventors are pleased by the renewed popularity of patents,\nbecause stronger patents give them greater leverage with the manufacturers and\nlicensing companies they sell their inventions to. Patents granted to\nindependent inventors rose thirty-seven per cent in the last half of the\neighties. Automobile and computer manufacturers\u2014businesses that assemble many\npieces of technology into a product, as opposed to businesses whose product is\na single technology\u2014are not so pleased. They now have to pay royalties for\nparts that used to be free; or, if they decide to infringe a patent, they can\nno longer be reasonably confident of getting away with it. The number of\npatent-infringement cases in litigation in 1990 was fifty per cent greater\nthan the number in 1980, and the average damage award has tripled.\n\nThe boom in intellectual property has been good for the Patent Office; patents\nare its principal source of income. Last year, the Patent Office took in two\nhundred and forty-five million dollars from patent and trademark fees, its\nbest year ever. It has raised the number of its patent examiners to fourteen\nhundred and forty-six. (In 1980, there were nine hundred and forty-nine.) They\nwork on six floors above the Search Room, their desks and floors awash in\npatent applications. The Commissioner of Patents has a spacious office on the\ntop floor of the building.\n\nSign Up for The Sunday Archive Newsletter\n\nRead classic New Yorker stories, curated by our archivists and editors.\n\nHarry F. Manbeck, a trim, forceful, no-nonsense sort of fellow, who was until\nrecently the commissioner, is naturally pleased with the robust good health\nthat the patent system currently enjoys. \u201cI think there is an increasing\nawareness of the importance of technology in America, and of the need to\nprotect our technology from incursions by others,\u201d he said not long ago.\n\u201cHaving said that, I think it is remarkable, isn\u2019t it, that the system that\nwas used for granting the first patent\u201d\u2014he waved toward a framed copy of that\ndocument, hanging on a wall behind a secretary\u2014\u201cis essentially the same as the\nsystem used in granting Patent No. 5,000,000, for . . .\u201d He shot a glance,\nover his spectacles, toward an aide.\n\n\u201cEthanol Production by Escherichia Coli Strains Co-Expressing Zymomonas PDC\nand ADH Genes,\u201d said the aide, reading from a clipboard.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Manbeck said. He leaned back, laced his hands behind his head, and\ndirected his gaze out the window. Across an expanse of the Potomac floodplain,\nairplanes were landing at National Airport.\n\nBob Kearns grew up in River Rouge, a working-class neighborhood on the west\nside of Detroit. Two things about the place captured Kearns\u2019 imagination. One\nwas Our Lady of Lourdes Cathedral, a big red brick Catholic church, which, he\nremembers, imported water from the real Lourdes. The other thing was the Ford\nMotor Company\u2019s Rouge plant, the largest industrial complex in the world.\nKearns\u2019 father, who was a roll turner for the Great Lakes Steel Corporation,\nhad once taken his son to visit the Rouge, and Kearns recalls that he had been\n\u201cjust so impressed by the magnitude of what Ford\u2019s was doing.\u201d Lumber from\nFord forests; ore and coal and coke from Ford mines; silica sand from Ford\nquarries, for making windshields; rubber from Ford plantations in Fordlandia,\nin Brazil, for making tires\u2014all flowed into the Rouge aboard Ford trains and\nFord ships, to be refined and machined and assembled into Fords. At the Rouge,\na car could be made from raw materials in four days.\n\nAs a teen-ager, Kearns worked in some of the job shops that used to fill the\nstreets and alleys of Detroit. One place made the molding around the opera\nwindows on Cadillacs. That was its entire business. Another place made the\ndies for the tools that were used to install one part of the landing gear of\nC-5 transport planes. The father of one of Kearns\u2019 friends had designed a\nbetter car-door handle\u2014the familiar bar of curved steel with the push button\nunder it\u2014which helped prevent the door from opening if the car rolled. The man\nmade a fortune supplying G.M. \u201cThe automotives, the automotives,\u201d Kearns once\nsaid to me. \u201cThat\u2019s all there was. If you were an inventor, and you really\nwanted to reach people, you invented for the automotives. I remember when\nCharley Wilson\u201d\u2014the president of G.M. in the forties and fifties\u2014\u201csaid, What\u2019s\ngood for G.M. is good for America. I really believed that was true.\u201d\n\nKearns\u2019 first invention was a comb that dispensed its own hair tonic. It did\nnot get beyond the model stage. He experimented with an amplifier for people\nwho had undergone laryngectomies and with a new kind of weather balloon. In\n1957, he invented a navigational system that he hoped the military would use\nin its Sidewinder missiles. His ex-wife, Phyllis, remembers him dancing her\naround the kitchen and saying he was going to buy her two Cadillacs, one for\neach foot. \u201cIt was so exciting,\u201d Phyllis recalls. \u201cIt was always so exciting,\nliving with Robert\u2014such an adrenaline high.\u201d The navigational system didn\u2019t\npan out, either. Kearns tried again.\n\nWhen the idea for the intermittent wiper came to him, Kearns and his wife and\ntheir four young children were living in a brick house on Rutherford Street,\non the north side of Detroit. Kearns, who had a master\u2019s in mechanical\nengineering from Wayne State University, was commuting to Case Western\nReserve, in Cleveland, where he was working toward his Ph.D. He believes that\nhis great idea grew in some mysterious way out of the eye injury he had\nreceived on his wedding night, in a country inn in Ontario. \u201cPhyllis was in\nthe bathroom, you know, changing, and I was sitting on the bed opening the\nchampagne. And I\u2019d never opened champagne before. And\u2014pow! The cork goes off,\nhits me directly in the left eye, I fall back on the bed bleeding all over the\nsheets, Phyllis comes out of the bathroom screaming. I mean, it was a mess.\u201d\n\nKearns worked on the wiper on weekends during the first half of 1963. He\nconstructed a glassed-in office for himself on one side of the basement, where\nhe could work without interference from the kids. The other half was Phyllis\u2019s\nlaundry room. \u201cI\u2019d be over here, doing laundry, up to my ears in kids, and\nhe\u2019d be over there behind the glass with his feet up,\u201d Phyllis recalls. \u201cWell,\nhe said he did his best work with his feet up.\u201d\n\nBy the summer, Kearns had built a working model of his invention. He could\nvary the time the wipers dwelled at the base of the windshield; he could vary\nthe speed with which they swept it; he had even figured out a way of making\nthe wipers automatically adjust their interval to the amount of water on the\nglass. He put his wiper control in a red metal box that on the outside had the\nwords \u201cFor Engineering Tests Only. Do Not Open. Proprietary Design Property of\nKearns Engineers,\u201d and two friends installed the box in the Galaxie.\n\nPhyllis: \u201cIf it rained, we would stop whatever we were doing, run out to the\ncar, turn the wipers on, and drive around. Doing life tests, Robert called\nit.\u201d\n\nBob: \u201cI had figured out that the elasticity of rainwater was different from\nthe elasticity of hose water, and I wanted to set the thing just right.\u201d\n\nPhyllis: \u201cOh, I felt so proud, driving that car in the rain. I\u2019d get both my\nhands right up at the top of the steering wheel, where people passing could\nsee them, so they knew I wasn\u2019t just switching the wipers on and off.\u201d\n\nIn October, Kearns decided that the time had come to demonstrate his invention\nto a car manufacturer. He chose Ford, because it had supplied him with some\nwiper motors to experiment on and because \u201cto me Ford was always the\ngreatest.\u201d Through his brother Marty, who worked in body engineering at Ford,\nhe made contact with a man named John Ciupak, who he believed \u201chad a\nsubstantial position in windshield wipers,\u201d and Ciupak said he should come\nover to the engineering complex in Dearborn, Ford\u2019s headquarters. Kearns drove\nthe Galaxie over. He met Ciupak inside, and brought him out to the parking\nlot. He demonstrated variable speed, variable dwell, and moisture\nresponsiveness. He let Ciupak try. They spent about forty-five minutes at it\naltogether, and Ciupak seemed impressed. However, he explained to Kearns that\nhis field was wiper linkages and blades\u2014that Joe Neill, the executive\nengineer, was the man Kearns needed to speak to.\n\nThree days later, Kearns, once again driving the Galaxie, reappeared for his\nappointment with Neill. He was surprised to find about ten Ford engineers\nwaiting for him in the parking lot. They took turns running the wipers; they\npoked around under the hood; they crawled under the dash. One at a time,\nseveral engineers took Kearns aside and asked him how his wiper worked. \u201cI\ndidn\u2019t want to tell them how I\u2019d done it, but I didn\u2019t want to be impolite,\neither,\u201d Kearns recalls. Eventually, Neill appeared. He had a Mercury brought\nout of the lab, and, keeping Kearns at a distance, demonstrated to him that,\nas chance would have it, Ford was working on an intermittent wiper, too.\nNonetheless, Neill said, Ford would like to look at Kearns\u2019 invention, if\nKearns would like to show it to Ford.\n\nNeill then said he would like to know how much Kearns\u2019 wipers cost to build.\nHe also arranged for Kearns to get instructions on Ford\u2019s specification tests:\nthe wipers had to run three million cycles, and they had to be able to operate\nat two hundred and seventy degrees, the maximum temperature under the hood.\nKearns left in a state of euphoria. Many years later, recalling that day in a\ncourt document, he wrote, \u201cI was in heaven!\u201d\n\nTed Daykin was one of the Ford engineers who came out into the parking lot to\ninspect Kearns\u2019 Galaxie in 1963. Daykin spent thirty-eight years, his entire\ncareer, working as an engineer at Ford, and took early retirement two years\nago. He is almost exactly the same age as Kearns, received a similar\neducation, and also devoted many years to windshield-wiper experiments, but\nthe two men are nothing alike. Daykin looks about ten years younger than\nKearns, and he appears to be one of the steadiest of men. He and his wife,\nPrill, live in a spacious ranch-style house in Dearborn, within a mile of the\nFord engineering laboratories where Ted did his life\u2019s work. Around the living\nroom are framed photographs of the Daykin family: their daughter, Elizabeth,\nwho is also an engineer at Ford; Elizabeth\u2019s husband, Gregory, who works in\nproduct planning for General Motors; and the Daykins\u2019 son, Robert, who works\non the Pontiac account for a local advertising agency.\n\nDaykin began experimenting with windshield wipers in 1957, when his supervisor\nasked him to design an electric wiper motor. Electricity was the new auto\ntechnology then. Electric windows, electric locks, electric trunk catches were\nthe latest gadgets. But wipers were one of the quiet backwaters of automotive\ntechnology. The standard wiper was driven by intake from the engine manifold,\nwhich was connected by a series of hoses to the wiper motor. The wipers wiped\nfrom the center of the windshield out, leaving a big unwiped V in the middle.\n\nFord had asked Daykin and his colleagues to invent a wiper system in which the\nblades moved parallel to each other. \u201cSee, Chrysler had come out with parallel\nblades in 1955, and people liked them,\u201d Daykin says. \u201cSo Ford wanted parallel\nblades. But the problem with parallel blades is that your surface area is too\nlarge for the mechanism to drive the wipers effectively.\u201d Daykin\u2019s electric\nmotor, linked to parallel blades, appeared as a standard feature on 1959\nMercurys and as an option on 1959 Lincolns, and it was immediately popular. At\nthat time, the beauty of the option business was just beginning to dawn on the\nauto industry. By keeping the base price of the car low\u2014even selling the car\nat a loss\u2014Ford could bring customers into the dealerships, then sell them a\nbunch of options that were extremely profitable for Ford.\n\nWindshield wipers were a potentially rich source of options. \u201cThe success of\nthose parallel blades got management thinking, Well, what other wiper options\ncan we come up with?\u201d Daykin says. \u201cSo I was told to organize a windshield-\nwiper group, and to play around and see what else we could invent. You know, a\nlot of people don\u2019t really spend a lot of time thinking about their wipers.\nThey turn them on, they turn them off, and that\u2019s about it. But the fact is\nthat there are dozens of inventions that go into the way your wipers work.\nWhat causes wipers to complete their wipe cycle when they\u2019re turned off mid-\nwipe? How, when they have returned to the base of the windshield, do they park\nthemselves out of the driver\u2019s sight? In the industry, we call that feature\n\u2018depressed park.\u2019 How are wipers synchronized with the wash mechanism\u2014what\nmakes the wiper go on automatically when you push the washer, and give you two\nor three wipes? How about the rear-window wiper? Well, when you talk about\nthat stuff you\u2019re talking about the inventions of windshield-wiper engineers.\u201d\nIn the early sixties, Daykin and his colleagues busied themselves with\ninventing features like those. \u201cOf course, one of the things we worked on was\nthe intermittent wiper. How do you design a circuit where the wiper comes to a\nstop at the base of the windshield and then goes into its cycle again? The\nintermittent wiper was\u2014 Well, I won\u2019t say it was the Holy Grail for wiper\nengineers. But it was the obvious next step for wipers to take.\u201d\n\nThe basic problem to solve in inventing an intermittent windshield wiper was\nthe timing device\u2014the thing that sends current to the wiper motor at regular\nintervals. What should the timing device be? One of the engineers working with\nDaykin had designed a circuit that relied on a bimetallic timer. The timer\nworked like a thermostat, on the principle that two different kinds of metal\nwill expand and contract at different rates when their temperature changes.\nThe problem with this invention was that it took some time to heat up. On very\ncold days, it might not work at all. Also, getting the wiper to dwell for\nshort periods was difficult, because of the time it took for the switch to\nheat and cool.\n\nIn late 1961, Ford\u2019s principal supplier of windshield-wiper components, a\nBuffalo-based company called Trico Products, brought a new intermittent device\nto Ford. It was a small vacuum chamber, about the size and shape of a bathtub\nstopper, that contained a plunger and spring, and had two small air hoses\nattached to it. The outlet hose ran to the engine manifold, and the inlet hose\nran to the dashboard, where it was attached to a small dial. The engine, as it\ncooled itself, sucked in air through the outlet hose, producing suction in the\nvacuum chamber, and so drawing the plunger down and compressing the spring.\nThe driver used the dial mounted on the dash to control the flow of air into\nthe vacuum chamber. The spring moved a switch in the wiper circuit to the\n\u201coff\u201d position, and the wipers dwelled. The spring eventually caused the\nplunger to rise, and moved the switch to the \u201con\u201d position. The wipers wiped.\n\nAs a piece of engineering, the Trico system was not especially distinguished.\nIt was something of a Rube Goldberg contraption. It had twenty-nine moving\nparts, which meant a lot of potential for breaking down. When the driver\naccelerated, the vacuum was insufficient to run the intermittent mode, and the\nwipers would default to high speed. Trico, in trying to sell the wiper to\nFord, advertised this as a specially designed passing feature\u2014useful, say, in\novertaking a truck on a rainy day. \u201cThe engineers saw it for what it was,\nwhich was a design flaw,\u201d Daykin says. \u201cBut the planners thought that the\npassing feature was really neat.\u201d Management decided to offer Trico\u2019s\nintermittent wiper as an option on 1965 Mercurys, and the wiper division went\nto work developing it. This was the intermittent wiper that Kearns saw when he\npaid his first visit to the engineering building.\n\nKearns\u2019 intermittent wiper was an elegant piece of engineering. It had four\nparts, and only one of them moved. It was a leap forward, beyond electricity\nand into electronics. Though Kearns did not realize it, he was on the\nthreshold of the next revolution in automotive technology. He had worked for\nthe Bendix Corporation in the mid-fifties, and had some experience with\nelectronic control systems, which were then used only in high technology, like\ncomputers. A transistor, a capacitor, and a variable resistor were the three\nbasic components of Kearns\u2019 circuit. The resistor and the capacitor together\nwere the timer, and the transistor worked as the switch. The resistor, which\nthe driver could adjust with a knob, controlled the rate of current flowing\ninto the capacitor. When the voltage in the capacitor reached a certain level,\nit triggered the transistor; the transistor turned on, and the wipers wiped\nonce. The running of the wiper motor drained voltage out of the capacitor; it\nsank below the threshold level of the transistor, and the transistor turned\noff. The wipers dwelled until the capacitor recharged.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that Dr. Kearns\u2019 wiper circuit was interesting,\u201d Daykin\nsays. \u201cHe had a three-brush motor, with dynamic brake and intermittent on one\nspeed only\u2014his system was a concatenation of a lot of different ideas. But we\nfigured there was just no way in the world it was patentable. An electronic\ntiming device was an obvious thing to try next. How can you patent something\nthat is in the natural evolution of technology?\u201d Daykin shook his head. He\nsaid he had spent much of his last year at Ford helping to prepare for the\nKearns case, and the experience had caused him to think a lot about the patent\nsystem. \u201cI think about all those Ford engineers I worked with developing wiper\nsystems. Dozens of inventors\u2014maybe a hundred\u2014contributed to your intermittent\nwindshield wiper. There were men from Trico, Magnetti Marelli, Rover,\nPrestolite, Delco, General Motors, Chrysler, and Ford. I don\u2019t know who some\nof them were\u2014nobody does. They were the real inventors of the intermittent\nwindshield wiper, not Kearns.\u201d\n\nPrill could be heard in the dining room, setting the table for a family lunch.\n\u201cPatents were meant to encourage innovation, after all, not static ownership,\u201d\nDaykin says. \u201cCan you imagine where we would be if each one of those engineers\nhad gone after a patent? We\u2019d all still be driving around with two-speed\nwipers.\u201d\n\nHaving received the go-ahead from Ford, Kearns began testing his intermittent\nwiper. He figured that putting it through three million cycles would take six\nmonths. He bought an aquarium, installed the wipers in it, filled the tank\nwith a mixture of oil and sawdust to simulate a load on the wiper, and set it\nover on Phyllis\u2019s side of the basement. It was Phyllis\u2019s job, when her husband\nwas away, to keep an eye on the tank; occasionally, she would stir its\ncontents with a cooking spoon. When Kearns came home from Case Western Reserve\non weekends, he devoted himself to wiper experiments. On Friday night,\nsometimes all night, Phyllis would watch the oscilloscope, an EKG-like monitor\nfor measuring electrical impulses, while Bob tried components in different\nconfigurations. On Saturday, he would be out in the driveway all day, bent\nover the Galaxie, making adjustments. He would fill the neighbors in on his\nprogress. A salesman from Motorola or Delco might stop by, with a quote on\nresistors. On Saturday evening, the whole family gathered in the living room\nand inked in circuit diagrams, for making printed circuit boards. On Sunday,\nafter church, Bob drove Phyllis and the kids around Detroit, scouting out\nsites for the Kearns wiper factory. \u201cDad had picked out jobs for each of us,\u201d\nhis son Tim recalls. \u201cMy brother Dennis was going to be the company lawyer, I\nwas going to be the chief engineer, and my brother Robert would be the head\nmechanic.\u201d By the late fall of 1963, Phyllis was pregnant again. \u201cHow about a\ngirl?\u201d she remembers Bob saying. \u201cWe need a computer programmer.\u201d\n\nThe wipers completed their three-million-four-hundred-thousandth wipe on\nNovember 16, 1964. (Kearns had let the wipers run another four hundred\nthousand cycles for good measure.) He called Ford with the good news, but Ford\ndidn\u2019t seem overexcited. His financial situation was becoming dire. His family\nwas large; his income as a doctoral fellow was not, and he was spending a\nconsiderable portion of it on wiper components. Also, he needed money to get\nhis patents. Phyllis was supportive\u2014\u201cI thought the sun was never going to set\non Robert,\u201d she says\u2014but Phyllis\u2019s mother had begun to wonder why her son-in-\nlaw didn\u2019t get a regular job in the auto industry, like so many of his\nclassmates. \u201cOh, but giving up the rights to his patents would have killed\nRobert,\u201d Phyllis says. \u201cHe would have died.\u201d\n\nKearns finally took action: \u201cI waited for a rainy day, then I drove over to\nsee Dave Tann.\u201d Tann was one of six brothers who had expanded the business\nstarted by their father, a small tool-and-die shop, into the Tann Corporation,\na midsize manufacturing company that supplied carmakers with various parts and\ntools\u2014fenders, dashboards, hood ornaments, dies for stamping out hoods. He was\nthe sort of man Kearns imagined himself becoming. Kearns brought Tann out to\nthe car and showed him the intermittent wiper. \u201cDave got in the car, drove\naround awhile, and came back all excited,\u201d Kearns recalls. \u201c \u2018This is great!\nThis is great!\u2019 he kept saying. He wouldn\u2019t give me my car back. He said,\n\u2018Here, we\u2019ll swap. Take my Cadillac.\u2019 So I drove that home, and he took mine.\u201d\nThey agreed that Kearns would assign his rights to the intermittent wiper to\nTann, and Tann would take over the cost of getting the patents. In addition,\nTann would pay Kearns a thousand dollars a month to continue his wiper R. &\nD., plus royalties when the wiper went into production. Kearns went home that\nafternoon with his first year\u2019s payment, twelve thousand dollars in cash.\n\u201cRobert came home, got me and the kids into the kitchen, and covered the whole\nkitchen counter with money,\u201d Phyllis says. \u201cThat was a great day.\u201d\n\nDick Aitken, Tann\u2019s patent attorney, filed the first patent application for\nKearns\u2019 intermittent wiper in December of 1964. When it comes to writing\npatent applications, patent attorneys talk about \u201cstaking out the four corners\nof the invention,\u201d and Aitken did an excellent job of staking them as far\napart as he could. The first patent was granted in November, 1967. Meanwhile,\nTann had made contact with Ford, and he and Kearns had given a formal\npresentation to a group of Ford engineers and executives. \u201cDave bought a new\ncar to make the demonstration with,\u201d Kearns says. \u201cAnd that car was Henry\nFord\u2019s favorite color\u2014black. It had black everything. Black tires, black\nwheels, and black leather seats. Dave said, \u2018Black is what Ford likes? Well,\nwe\u2019ll give \u2019em what they like.\u2019 That was how Dave Tann did things.\u201d The\ndemonstration was a hit, and it led to a series of demonstrations to other\nparts of the Ford organization.\n\nFinally, Roger Shipman, a Ford supervisor, announced to Kearns that he had\n\u201cwon the wiper competition.\u201d He told Kearns that his wiper would be used on\nthe 1969 Mercury line. Kearns was given the prototype of a windshield-wiper\nmotor to commemorate the occasion. The other engineers welcomed him aboard\nFord\u2019s wiper team. Then, according to Kearns, Shipman asked him to show his\nwiper control to the rest of the team. Wipers were a safety item, Shipman\nexplained, and the law required disclosure of all the engineering before Ford\ncould give Kearns a contract. This sounded reasonable to Kearns, so he\nexplained to the Ford engineers exactly how his intermittent wiper worked.\n\nAbout five months later, Kearns was dismissed. He was told that Ford did not\nwant his wiper system after all\u2014that the other engineers had designed their\nown. Kearns remembers that one of the engineers taunted him as he was leaving.\nThen, about six months after the dismissal, Shipman called Kearns, told him\nhis wiper still had a chance for the 1969 model year, and asked him to come in\nagain. \u201cAnd, just like a lover, I went back again,\u201d Kearns says. \u201cBecause what\nelse could I do? Ford was my market. Plus I did not really believe at that\ntime that Ford would infringe my patent. I mean, I believed in Ford. I\u2019m a\nbeliever.\u201d\n\nThomas Jefferson was the first su perintendent of our patent system, and our\nfirst patent examiner. Among the public men of the late eighteenth century, he\nwas by far the best qualified for the job. He was an inventor himself: he\ninvented a moldboard for plows, a swivel chair, a pedometer, a camp stool, and\na copying device, among other things. He was interested in inventors, and\nseems to have understood them.\n\nAnother quality that made Jefferson the right person to run the patent system\nwas that he distrusted patents. Patents, being monopolies, were dangerous in a\nrepublic conceived in part as an anti-monopoly haven. Starting a patent system\nwas like providing the young economy with enough rope to hang itself.\nJefferson was familiar with the havoc that patents had caused in the British\neconomy. In England, in the late sixteenth century, Elizabeth I had discovered\nthat when Parliament refused to give her money she could raise it herself by\nselling monopoly rights to noblemen. In 1623, to put a stop to that practice,\nParliament passed the Statute of Monopolies, which declared monopolies\nillegal. However, the statute contained an exception for patents: to encourage\ninnovation, Parliament allowed genuine inventors the right to hold limited\nmonopolies on their inventions.\n\nThe trouble was that Parliament did not figure out how to determine who was a\ngenuine inventor and what a genuine invention was. It was easy for Elizabeth\u2019s\nsuccessor, James I, and for his son, Charles I, to go on selling monopolies to\nbogus inventors who could afford to buy them. This was one reason that, in\n1649, Parliament chopped off Charles\u2019s head.\n\nJefferson thought he could fix the basic flaw in the British system. His\nsolution was the principle of examination. The principle is that certain\ninnovations have a quality that elevates them to the status of inventions, and\nthus makes them eligible to be held as private property, while innovations\nthat lack this quality are the common property of humanity. Learned people\ncan, by study and power of reason, determine which inventions deserve a patent\nand which do not. Examination is the greatest American contribution to the\ninstitution of patents, and it has been copied by virtually every industrial\nnation in the world. Like a lot of ideas associated with the Enlightenment, it\nsounds a lot better than it works.\n\nJefferson and his fellow-examiners struggled to come up with a definition for\n\u201cinvention.\u201d Jefferson declared that in order to be patentable an invention\nhad to be new and useful, but he found that some new and useful inventions\nwere too frivolous to be worth \u201cthe embarrassment of an exclusive patent,\u201d as\nhe put it. He did make sure the law stated that a patent could go only to \u201cthe\ntrue and sole inventor.\u201d Of course, when Jefferson used the word \u201cinventor\u201d he\nhad in mind a farmer or a small manufacturer who in the course of harvesting a\ncrop or making a doorknob would discover a shortcut or devise a new tool that\nwould make the job easier or the product better. The idea of an industrial-\nresearch laboratory, a place staffed by thousands of inventors working for a\nsingle organization, could hardly have occurred to Jefferson.\n\nIn 1906, a patent lawyer named Edwin Prindle published a series of articles in\nthe magazine Engineering in which he explained to businesses how they could\nuse patents to restrain trade. \u201cPatents are the best and most effective means\nof controlling competition,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey occasionally give absolute\ncommand of the market, enabling their owner to name the price without regard\nto cost of production. . . . Patents are the only legal form of absolute\nmonopoly.\u201d Patent lawyers recommended the use of what are called improvement\npatents, by which the life of a patent\u2014in the United States, its life is\nseventeen years\u2014could be extended almost indefinitely. First, one had to get\ncontrol of a basic patent on a new technology, and the best way of doing that\nwas to organize a trust and buy the patent from the inventor. If no basic\npatent existed, the trust could simply buy up all the minor patents in the\nfield. Then, every year or two, inventors working for the company could come\nup with a slightly improved version of the technology and patent it, and the\nseventeen-year clock would start over. The lawyers suggested hiring large\nnumbers of inventors, to build a fortress of improvement patents around the\nbasic patent and keep competitors far from the company\u2019s technology. These\ninventors would, of course, have to sign contracts surrendering the right to\ntheir ideas. While this was not in the spirit of the patent system designed by\nJefferson, it was technically legal: the law could not prevent the inventor\nfrom assigning his idea, once it had become his private property, to someone\nelse.\n\nThe first corporations were essentially large blocks of patents. Western Union\ngrew from Samuel Morse\u2019s patents on the telegraph, International Harvester\nfrom Cyrus McCormick\u2019s patents on the reaper, General Electric from Edison\u2019s\npatents on the light bulb, and A.T. & T. from Bell\u2019s patents on the telephone.\nIndependent inventors began to find it difficult to compete with inventors\nhired by the corporations. A lot of them took jobs in corporate research\nlaboratories\u2014they were willing to exchange the chance of getting rich for the\ncertainty of a regular salary. The ones that remained independent turned to\ninventing gadgets and toys to survive. Opining on whether or not this is a\ngood thing is one of the set pieces of technology histories. Some people see\nthe rise of hired inventors as a natural part of the evolution of technology;\nothers see it as a wrong turn.\n\nJames B. Conant: \u201cAs theory developed in physics and chemistry and penetrated\ninto practice, as the degree of empiricism was reduced in one area after\nanother, the inventor was bound to disappear.\u201d\n\nJohn Kenneth Galbraith: \u201cTechnical development has long since become the\npreserve of the scientist and the engineer. Most of the cheap and simple\ninventions have, to put it bluntly, been made.\u201d\n\nPhilo Farnsworth: \u201cWe must not lose track of the fact that inventions as such,\nimportant inventions, are made by individuals and almost invariably by\nindividuals with very limited means.\u201d\n\nNikola Tesla: \u201cInvention is predominantly individualistic. Everything of prime\nmoment comes from some individual unconnected with any commercial\norganization.\u201d\n\nIn 1969, Ford came out with a new, electronic intermittent windshield wiper,\nthe first in the industry. It used a transistor, a resistor, and a capacitor\nin the same configuration that Kearns had designed. It cost Ford about ten\ndollars to make, and it sold for thirty-seven dollars. At first, Ford offered\nthe intermittent wiper as a stand-alone option, and it sold slowly. Then Ford\npackaged it with another gadget\u2014the remote-control side mirror, which was one\nof Ford\u2019s most popular options\u2014and wiper sales took off. In 1974, General\nMotors began putting the intermittent wiper on its cars, and in 1977 it\nappeared on Chryslers. Saab, Honda, Volvo, Rolls-Royce, and Mercedes, among\nothers, soon followed. By 1989, Ford alone had sold 20.6 million cars with the\nintermittent wiper, and made a profit that has been calculated at five hundred\nand fifty-seven million dollars. Altogether, about thirty million intermittent\nwipers are sold around the world each year.\n\nKearns tried to get an explanation from Ford, but he soon discovered that\n\u201cthere\u2019s a diode in the line when you talk to Ford\u2014the information only goes\none way.\u201d His lawyers wrote letters to Ford\u2019s legal department, informing it\nthat Ford was infringing Kearns\u2019 patents. Eventually, they received a letter\nback saying that Ford was not infringing Kearns\u2019 patents and that, in any\ncase, Kearns\u2019 patents were invalid. \u201cI just felt very diminished,\u201d Kearns\nsays. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re a nothing, you\u2019re a gnat. You don\u2019t count. You just\ndon\u2019t count.\u201d\n\nKearns wanted Tann to sue Ford. \u201cAs a practical matter, we couldn\u2019t sue Ford\nfor patent infringement, because they were one of the family\u2019s main sources of\nbusiness,\u201d Tann said later, of his company. \u201cWe needed Ford\u2019s good will to\nkeep our business alive.\u201d\n\nSeveral years passed. Kearns got his patent rights back from Tann. He moved\nhis family to Gaithersburg, Maryland, to take a job with the Bureau of\nStandards, testing the skid resistance of various kinds of road surfaces.\nKearns was in his mid-forties now. On July 8, 1976, Dennis Kearns stopped in\nat a Mercedes service center, bought a wiper control, and brought it home to\nhis father. Kearns went down to the basement and took it apart. \u201cAnd I saw\ncapacitor, resistor, transistor\u2014it was all there,\u201d he recalls. \u201cEven the great\nMercedes had infringed my patents.\u201d He wandered distractedly out of his home,\nhitchhiked to Washington, and got on a Greyhound headed South. Somehow, he had\nbecome convinced that Richard Nixon wanted him to go to Australia, to build an\nelectric car. \u201cThen I realized I\u2019d never spent any time with my kids. I\u2019d been\nso consumed with my work on the wiper that I\u2019d never even shown them how to\nfly a kite. So I went and bought these two kites. When the police picked me up\na few days later, I was in Tennessee, in a park, holding these two kites.\u201d\n\nIn 1978, Kearns filed suit against Ford for patent infringement. Eventually,\nhe added other car companies to the suit, but Ford was the principal focus of\nhis hatred. \u201cI just had an overwhelming feeling that what Ford had done was\nwrong,\u201d Kearns says. \u201cIt was unjust, and it was illegal.\u201d In his suit he asked\nfor three hundred and fifty million dollars in lost profits, multiplied by\nthree\u2014the maximum penalty for willful infringement\u2014plus interest and costs,\nfor a total of $1.6 billion.\n\nHenry Ford loathed patents. One of Ford\u2019s lawyers once boasted, \u201cThere is no\npower on earth, outside of the Supreme Court, which can make Henry Ford sign a\nlicense agreement or pay a royalty.\u201d Ford thought that the patent system\nshould be abolished, because, he said, it \u201cproduces parasites, men who are\nwilling to lay back on their oars and do nothing,\u201d and because patents afford\n\u201copportunities for little minds, directed by others more cunning, to usurp the\ngains of genuine inventors\u2014for pettifoggers to gain a strategic advantage over\nhonest men, and, under a smug protest of righteousness, work up a hold-up game\nin the most approved fashion.\u201d\n\nFord\u2019s opinion of the patent system was galvanized by the Selden Patent. In\n1879, George B. Selden, a resident of Rochester, had filed a patent\napplication in which he claimed to have invented the automobile. In his\napplication Selden described a machine with a gasoline-driven, combustion-type\nengine that sat in front of the driver; a clutch; a foot brake; a drive shaft;\nand front-wheel drive. Selden had never built such an automobile. He wasn\u2019t an\nespecially skilled mechanic. He was a patent lawyer, in fact. Selden believed\nthat in the not too distant future people were going to be riding around in\nmotorized cars of the type he envisioned, and he wanted to have a monopoly on\nthem.\n\nFor the next sixteen years, Selden kept his application pending in the Patent\nOffice, using his professional skills to draw the process out, amending the\napplication now and then, waiting for the men who were actually building\nautomobiles to produce one that was marketable. In 1895, he decided that the\nmoment had come, and he caused himself to receive Patent No. 549,160. An East\nCoast auto manufacturer named Albert Pope, who was backed by a syndicate of\ninvestors, made a royalty agreement with Selden and acquired the rights to his\npatent. In keeping with business practices of the day, Pope and his backers\nformed a trust, and called it the Association of Licensed Automobile\nManufacturers. The A.L.A.M. declared that any car manufacturer that did not\nget a license from the trust and pay a royalty of one and a quarter per cent\nof the sales price of each car it sold would be infringing the Selden Patent\nand would be sued. By 1905, eighty-five per cent of the auto industry was\nunder license to the A.L.A.M. Selden was promoted as the inventor of the\nautomobile.\n\nIn 1903, Henry Ford, then an unknown engineer from Detroit, had formed the\nFord Motor Company. He applied for a license from the A.L.A.M. but was judged\nto be merely a fly-by-night assembler of parts, not a bona-fide automobile\nmanufacturer, and was turned down. Ford decided to make and sell his cars\nanyway. He announced that he had no intention of paying his tithe to the\nSelden Patent, that the patent was unjust, and that the machine Selden\ndescribed could never have worked in the first place. The A.L.A.M. wasted no\ntime in suing Ford for patent infringement. The drama of Ford, a barely\neducated, plainspoken Midwesterner, defying the entire automobile industry, as\nwell as some of the most powerful interests on Wall Street, was irresistible\nto the public, and it made Ford famous.\n\nFord did not shrink from the attention. He expanded his position into a\ngeneral attack on the patent system. \u201cI believe absolutely in free\ncompetition, and in abolishing patents, which kill competition,\u201d he said. In\n\u201cMonopoly on Wheels,\u201d a 1961 book about the Selden case, William Greenleaf\nwrites, \u201cBy endowing his own struggle for a place in the sun with a luminous\nappeal to fundamental principles, [Ford] translated a wearisome patent suit\ninto one man\u2019s struggle for the right to enjoy unhampered opportunity. This\nwas a potent theme in a day when the politics of Progressivism was sweeping\nthe land and the movement for social democracy was still nourished by the\nhopes and ambitions of the small businessman.\u201d In 1911, Ford won the Selden\ncase on appeal, breaking the patent, destroying the A.L.A.M., propelling\nhimself into the dominant position in the auto industry, and insuring that\nfuture generations of Americans would regard Henry Ford, not George Selden, as\nthe inventor of the automobile.\n\nFor the rest of his life, Ford virtually ignored the patent system. \u201cAs a rule\nFord adamantly refused to adopt parts and components patented by others,\u201d\nGreenleaf writes. \u201cInstead, he ordered his engineers to evolve their own\ndesigns.\u201d Other carmakers designed their own parts, too. This gave the young\nautomobile industry the unique advantage of having free access to technology\nas soon as it was invented. Ford was a kind of Promethean figure, taking a\nrevolutionary new technology out of the hands of the \u00e9lite and giving it\ndirectly to the people. This was not necessarily the best thing for those who\ninvented the technology\u2014the designers of carburetors, sparkplugs, radiators,\nrubber tires, power steering, overdrive, the convertible top, rack-and-pinion\nsteering, the rear-window defroster, cruise control, air bags, and\nintermittent windshield wipers. However, Ford, in defense of his position on\npatents, often pointed out that his own invention\u2014a light, cheap, durable car\nthat could be mass-produced, like matches or pins, at a time when the industry\nwas committed to the automobile as a luxury product\u2014would have been impossible\nif he had been forced to pay for the inventions of other men. \u201cI invented\nnothing new,\u201d he once declared. \u201cI simply assembled into a car the discoveries\nof other men behind whom were centuries of work, and the discoveries of still\nother men who preceded them. Had I worked fifty or even ten or even five years\nbefore I would have failed. So it is with every new thing. Progress happens\nwhen all the factors that make for it are ready, and then it is inevitable. To\nteach that a comparatively few men are responsible for the great forward steps\nof mankind is the worst sort of nonsense.\u201d\n\nWhen Kearns filed suit against the Ford Motor Company, in 1978, Ford did what\ncorporations usually do in patent cases: it began stalling, in the hope that\nKearns would lose heart or run out of money. Patent cases are richly endowed\nwith opportunities for stalling. The heart of Ford\u2019s defense was that Kearns\u2019\npatents were invalid, because according to the Doctrine of Nonobviousness his\nintermittent wiper was not an invention at all.\n\nThe Doctrine of Nonobviousness is the current solution to the problem that\nconfounded Jefferson: how to define invention. Over the last two centuries,\nmany people have tried to define it. Learned Hand, whom patent lawyers revere\nas one of the great patent judges of all time, wrote that the definition of\ninvention was \u201cas fugitive, impalpable, wayward, and vague a phantom as exists\nin the whole paraphernalia of legal concepts.\u201d The 1929 edition of \u201cWalker on\nPatents,\u201d the standard patent textbook, stated, \u201cWhat constitutes invention is\na very perplexing question.\u201d In 1937, this was revised to read \u201cAn invention\nis the result of an inventive act.\u201d An inventive act was generally considered\nto be a flash of insight that comes when the inventor is not striving for it,\nas in the case of Nikola Tesla, who was strolling through a park in Budapest\nand reciting some lines from Goethe when the concept of alternating current\nsuddenly came into his mind and he diagrammed it in the dust with a stick; or\nof Edwin Land, who was taking photographs of his three-year-old daughter one\nmorning in Sante Fe and, when she asked him why the pictures couldn\u2019t be seen\nimmediately, conceived the Polaroid process. The invention story was an\nimportant part of the invention itself.\n\nMost judges are not scientists. The average judge\u2019s view of invention tends to\nhave more to do with Coleridge\u2019s theories about the imagination than with the\njudge\u2019s experience inside an engineering lab. As the twentieth century got\nolder, and the gap between the liberal arts and the applied sciences got\nlarger, the problem got worse. The last straw came in 1941, when the Supreme\nCourt issued its \u201cflash of creative genius\u201d decision, in Cuno Engineering\nCorporation v. Automatic Devices Corporation. The invention in question was\nthe first cordless automobile cigarette lighter. The Court decided that it was\nnot patentable, because it lacked the characteristics of an invention. Justice\nWilliam O. Douglas, writing for the majority, stated that \u201cthe new device,\nhowever useful it may be, must reveal the flash of creative genius, not merely\nthe skill of the calling.\u201d\n\nPatent professionals began to feel that the legal view of invention was\ninconsistent with the way things actually got made, and that a more\nscientific, less romantic definition of invention was needed. A panel of\npatent experts produced the Doctrine of Nonobviousness, which became law in\nthe Patent Act of 1952. The doctrine states that a patentable invention must\nbe nonobvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time the\ninvention is made. While this definition is generally believed to be an\nimprovement over the flash of genius, it isn\u2019t perfect: there is a how-many-\nangels-can-dance-on-the-head-of-a-pin aspect to nonobviousness which makes it\npossible to argue cases almost indefinitely, and often the side with more\nlegal resources wins.\n\nThe lawsuit against Ford became Kearns\u2019 life. He put every penny he had into\nit. He was driven by an uncynical, almost spiritual belief in justice and an\nequally pure hatred of the automobile industry. At a hearing in 1980, Kearns\nsaid, \u201cI want you to understand that I am wearing a little badge here, and\nthat badge says that I am an inventor, andit says I am a net contributor to\nsociety. And it is like maybe you can\u2019t see the badge, and these other\ngentlemen can\u2019t see the badge, and I don\u2019t think anybody is going to be able\nto see the badge until my trial is finished in this courtroom and I will find\nout whether I am wearing the badge or not.\u201d After his breakdown over the\nMercedes wiper, he was unable to work. He collected disability from his\nemployer, the Bureau of Standards, and he and his son Tim assembled and sold\ndigital-difference-to-analog converters out of the basement of their home in\nGaithersburg. Tim says, \u201cI guess you could say the lawsuit has ruined my\nfather\u2019s life, but I don\u2019t choose to look at it that way. It is his life. If\nthere\u2019s a tragic aspect to it, it is that my father has never invented\nanything else. It would be interesting to know how many people\u2019s lives have\nbeen saved by the intermittent wiper, and how many more lives could have been\nsaved by his next invention. We\u2019ll never know, because he couldn\u2019t let this\none thing go. But he just couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nPhyllis Kearns stuck it out as long as she could. \u201cWe\u2019d gear ourselves up for\na hearing in ninety days,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd then, on the eighty-ninth day, the\nphone would ring, and I would hear Bob screaming and yelling, and it would\nturn out that Ford had dumped a bunch of new documents on us, and the hearing\nwould be postponed. Now, I had never heard shouting in the house before. My\nparents had never shouted. It got to the point where I just couldn\u2019t take it.\u201d\nPhyllis left her husband in 1980. \u201cRobert expected me to have the same focus\nhe did, and I just didn\u2019t have it.\u201d\n\nFrom time to time, when I felt the concept of what a patent was slipping away,\nI would get in touch with Jerry Lemelson. Lemelson has received over five\nhundred patents\u2014more than any other independent inventor alive. He inherited\nthe title two years ago, upon the death of Edwin Land, who had five hundred\nand thirty-three. If Lemelson contines to average twenty patents a year\u2014a pace\nhe has sustained for three decades\u2014he will catch Edison, who is the Hank Aaron\nof patents, with a thousand and ninety-three, by the time he is ninety-seven.\nLemelson is sixty-nine now. He is a compact fellow, with a bald head and a\ncomical New York squawk. He talks quickly. Behind each of his inventions is a\nstory about how it came to him, and Lemelson tells it in the manner of a\nstandup comedian, except that instead of a punch line at the end there is an\ninvention.\n\nSome people see life in terms of a photograph or a song or a short story;\nLemelson sees it in terms of a patent. He thinks in patents, and sometimes he\ndreams in patents. Lemelson holds patents on machine-vision systems, an\nindustrial robot, a fax machine, a copy machine, a tape-recorder drive, and a\ncamcorder. It\u2019s hard to think of a technology he has not patented. Once, when\nI was talking to him on a cordless telephone, we had one of those electronic\ndrifts which such phones are subject to. \u201cDarn,\u201d Lemelson said. \u201cI invented\nthis thing, too.\u201d\n\nWhen Lemelson invents, he first selects a particular field\u2014say, microsurgery,\nwhich he is currently looking into. (He has a patent on an electronically\ncontrolled tourniquet.) He may hire a patent searcher to obtain copies of all\nthe patents in that art or he may go down to the Patent Office and read the\npatents himself. He tries to imagine the path along which the art will\ndevelop, and to construct a patent application that sits squarely in the\nmiddle of it, so that even if the invention is never manufactured\u2014and only one\nin every seven of Lemelson\u2019s inventions is actually made\u2014his patent will be\nlike a tollgate on a highway, at which all travellers must stop. Lemelson\u2019s\ngreat advantage over other inventors is that he writes all his patent\napplications himself. Though in theory a patent application is merely a\nrendering of the invention in language, in reality it is a kind of invention\nitself. \u201cIt takes great skill to craft a patent application,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\nhave to stake the four corners of your invention broadly enough so that they\ngive you maximum protection. You tend to avoid adjectives. You don\u2019t say\n\u2018transistor\u2019 when you can use \u2018controllable electronic valve\u2019\u2014that sort of\nthing. Of course, if you write too broadly you may invalidate your claim,\nbecause it will read on the prior art. But if you write too narrowly you may\nmiss the thing about the technology that turns out to be truly valuable.\u201d\n\nLast year, thanks to deals with Sony, Sanyo, Siemens, and others, Lemelson\nreportedly earned two hundred million dollars. He has filed suit against\nMotorola, Kodak, and Apple. Several years ago, he moved his residence from New\nJersey to Nevada. \u201cI don\u2019t mind saying that the reason for it is that it\u2019s a\nlot easier to litigate from out there,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I litigate in New\nJersey or New York, it takes five to ten years to get to trial. Out in Nevada,\nit only takes a year.\u201d\n\nLemelson is a corporation\u2019s worst nightmare. To his critics he is merely an\ninventor of paper patents, who is exploiting the power that the patent system\ngives the independent inventor. As Lemelson sees it, though, litigation is the\nonly way an independent inventor can protect his rights. \u201cOccasionally, it is\npossible to earn money selling licenses\u2014it\u2019s a lot easier these days than it\nused to be,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the simple fact is that most manufacturers would\nrather infringe a patent than pay a license. Have you heard of N.I.H.\u2014the Not\nInvented Here syndrome? Well, it\u2019s a disease that American industry in general\nsuffers from. The attitude is \u2018If we didn\u2019t invent it, we\u2019re not interested.\u2019\nOr \u2018If it\u2019s such a good invention, how come we didn\u2019t think of it?\u2019 Or \u2018Hey,\nwe have all these thousands of engineers on our payroll\u2014why should we have to\npay someone else for an idea?\u2019 It is virtually impossible for an independent\ninventor to invent for an American U.S. corporation. They\u2019re just not\ninterested in inventions that they don\u2019t make.\u201d\n\nClifford Sadler is an executive in the patent department of Ford. Sadler,\nknown to his colleagues as Kip, is a lean, likable fellow with silver hair and\na droll sense of humor. He listens to questions with his head to one side, his\nfingers making a lawyerly tent in his lap. \u201cElectronics was simply the way the\nworld was going,\u201d he told me recently. \u201cI would say it\u2019s to Dr. Kearns\u2019 credit\nthat he perceived this. But for Dr. Kearns to say he invented the electronic\nintermittent windshield wiper is, we feel, sadly unrealistic. Even in 1963,\nthe resistor-capacitor timing device was a standard piece of engineering\u2014it\nwas sophomore-in-college stuff.\u201d\n\nSadler stretched his long legs out in front of him, rocked back in his chair,\nand sighed. \u201cI think Dr. Kearns honestly believed he was part of the Ford\ndesign team,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Ford never saw it that way. As far as the\nengineers were concerned, Kearns was a sort of pest. He was always stopping by\nthe lab and saying, \u2018Hey, what\u2019s going on? Need any help?\u2019\u2014that sort of\nthing.\u201d Sadler said that under no circumstances had Ford copied Kearns\u2019\ndesign. \u201cAs for infringement, we had our lawyers examine Kearns\u2019 patents, and\nin their view the patents were invalid.\u201d He added that Kearns\u2019 great\nambition\u2014to be a supplier of windshield wipers to Ford\u2014was misguided. \u201cFord\nhas more than two thousand suppliers,\u201d he said. \u201cIn no case that I can think\nof has an independent inventor who has no manufacturing track record ever\nbecome a supplier to the auto industry. It just doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nThe Ford case came to trial in January, 1990\u2014twelve years after it was filed.\nMost of Kearns\u2019 patents had expired by then. The waters of progress had closed\nover his head. Judge Avern Cohn divided the trial into two parts: one to\ndetermine whether Kearns\u2019 patents were valid and infringed, and, if they were,\none to determine how much Ford should pay for infringing them.\n\nMarty Adelman, the Wayne State law professor, was an expert witness in the\nFord case. He told me that once Kearns got into the courtroom the odds of his\nwinning shifted dramatically in his favor. \u201cThe inventor has a piece of paper\nwith a big blue ribbon on it that issues from the Patent Office, and that he\ncan wave around in front of the jury, and the jury tends to say, \u2018Oh, he has a\npatent, he must be right,\u2019 \u201d Adelman said. \u201cThe corporation is placed in the\nvery formidable position of trying to convince the jury that the Patent Office\nis wrong.\n\n\u201cThe inventor has a story to tell. The cardinal rule for any patent attorney\nrepresenting an independent inventor is to tell the invention story. You\nknow\u2014how he got the idea. It comes to him in a dream, or when he\u2019s in the\nshower or mowing the lawn. In Kearns\u2019 case, the guy gets hit in the eye with a\nchampagne cork on his wedding night, he starts thinking about how the eye\nworks, and ends up inventing a wiper that works like an eyelid. A classic\ninvention story. That\u2019s not how things get invented in the lab. It\u2019s the\nheroic theory of invention versus the social theory of invention, and in front\nof a jury the former is going to win every time. The judge can lecture the\njury till he\u2019s blue in the face about the Doctrine of Nonobviousness, but the\nflash of genius is what people want to hear.\u201d\n\nAdelman thought for a moment and added, \u201cOf course, in the Kearns case the\nreally scary thing is that Kearns is probably crazy. I mean, any rational\nholdup artist would have taken the money.\u201d\n\nThe first trial lasted three weeks, and the jury deliberated for another week.\nIt found that Kearns\u2019 patents were valid and that Ford had infringed them.\nFord, concerned about the size of the award that a jury in Wayne County might\ngive Kearns, offered to settle the case for thirty million dollars. Kearns,\nagainst everyone\u2019s advice, turned the money down. \u201cTo accept money from Ford\nwould have been like admitting it was O.K. for them to do what they did,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nSo there was a second trial, and the second trial awarded Kearns $5.2 million,\nor about thirty cents a wiper plus interest. Kearns wasn\u2019t there for the\nverdict, having left the proceedings in protest two weeks earlier. Without\neven telling his family, Kearns had returned to Gaithersburg (\u201cINVENTOR IN\nWIPER LAWSUIT DISAPPEARS\u201d was the headline in the Detroit Free Press) got his\ncamping equipment, pitched a tent in Little Bennett Regional Park, in West\nVirginia, and was living off pork and beans. Meanwhile, Judge Cohn, his\npatience wearing thin, suggested that if Kearns did not reappear and accept\nthe money he might begin proceedings to determine whether or not Kearns was\nmentally competent. Finally, Kearns and Ford settled for $10.2 million.\n\nOn June 10, 1992, the night before the Chrysler verdict was announced, Kearns\nwent out on the town with his family: Dennis; Tim; Tim\u2019s girlfriend, Francine;\nMaureen; Maureen\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Paul; and Kathy. Wherever they went in downtown\nDetroit, bartenders and waiters came up and wished them good luck. Kearns\u2019\nspirits were high. He was confident that he had persuaded the jury to award\nhim a sum of money large enough to hurt Chrysler seriously\u2014he believed that\nthe sum would be around forty million\u2014and to send a message to corporations\neverywhere that patent infringement does not pay. \u201cI believe I laid it on \u2019em\npretty straight,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Kearnses ate dinner at the Pontchartrain Hotel. The possibility that the\nfamily might become extraordinarily wealthy the following morning wasn\u2019t\ndiscussed. The money was like a guest at the table to whom no one had been\nintroduced. People talked about it obliquely. Everyone chose a number and put\ntwenty dollars in a pool. After dinner was over and Kearns had left, Kathy\nsaid, \u201cThe main thing is that Dad seems happy.\u201d She said no one was under the\nillusion that the next day would be the end of anything. \u201cI remember during\nthe Ford case my father\u2019s girlfriend Jean used to say, \u2018Well, soon it will all\nbe over, and he\u2019ll be mine.\u2019 Finally, I had to say, \u2018Jean, are you crazy?\nDon\u2019t you get it? This is never going to end.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe next morning, the courtroom began filling up at eight-thirty. Lou Mihaly,\nKearns\u2019 college roommate, came, with his wife, Pinkie. The attendant from the\nFort Washington Garage, where Kearns parked his car, came. Phyllis was there.\nShe had driven up from Maryland the night before, with her son Robert. That\nnight, Kathy had said to me, \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that Mom still cares for Dad. I\nmean, you can see it in the way she is just thrilled when he comes up behind\nher and puts his hands on her shoulders. But she just can\u2019t live with the\nlawsuit. It\u2019s too crazy.\u201d Now Phyllis said she was trying not to be nervous,\nby focussing on the fact that the jury had already made its decision, and\nnothing she felt or did could change it. She clenched her hands into fists and\nsaid, \u201cOh, I want willful infringement so badly.\u201d\n\nShortly after nine, the jury came in. Judge Cohn asked his clerk, Judy\nCassady, if she would read the verdict. Ms. Cassady read, \u201cDid you find that\nDr. Kearns proved by clear and convincing evidence that Chrysler acted\nwillfully when it infringed any of Dr. Kearns\u2019 patents? Answer: no.\u201d Phyllis\ngasped softly. Ms. Cassady went on, \u201cWhat amount do you find is a reasonable\nroyalty on a per-unit basis for the total of twelve million five hundred and\nsixty-four thousand one hundred and seven units? Answer: ninety cents per\nunit.\u201d\n\nIn the silence that followed, one could almost hear people multiplying 12.5\nmillion by .9. It comes to about eleven and a half million dollars. With the\nyears of interest, the total will probably be around twenty million.\n\nJudge Cohn thanked the jurors for their efforts and dismissed them. Then he\nsaid goodbye to the lawyers. \u201cI\u2019m sure I will see you here again,\u201d he said in\nthe direction of Kearns.\n\nThe Kearns family moved out into the corridor. The garage attendant reached\nfor Kearns\u2019 hand, and Kearns accepted his congratulations somewhat awkwardly.\nReporters encircled him. Kearns looked grim. \u201cI would have to say I\u2019m\ndisappointed,\u201d he said. The family, standing around, seemed unsure of what to\ndo. It wasn\u2019t clear whether anyone felt like whooping it up over eleven and a\nhalf million dollars; it was perfectly clear that it would be considered bad\nform if anyone did. They talked about who had won the pool. Eventually, Kearns\nsaid he had to get over to the office, and he moved toward the elevators, with\na crowd of family and reporters trailing him. Down in the lobby, a woman\npointed at the entourage and said, \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d\n\nOne of the guards said, \u201cThat\u2019s the man who invented the intermittent\nwindshield wiper.\u201d\n\nThe family walked down West Lafayette Street. In the elevator, on the way up\nto Kearns\u2019 office, on the fourteenth floor, no one spoke. Kearns stared at the\nceiling. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand it,\u201d he said finally, to no one in\nparticular. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why they didn\u2019t hold for willfulness.\u201d\n\nThe family spilled out onto the fourteenth floor. The former tenants had\nrecently left, taking even the wall-to-wall carpeting with them, so we walked\nover slabs of epoxy-encrusted concrete. The view from the windows was of\ndowntown Detroit\u2014empty hotels and department stores, abandoned machine shops.\nIn an unused room sat a disembodied windshield-and-dashboard assembly from a\n1965 Dodge Dart, with a windshield-wiper system rigged up to it, which Kearns\nhad used in the trial.\n\nThe family went into the Kearns offices. It was only ten-thirty\u2014too early to\ngo out to lunch. Phyllis suggested that she make some coffee. Her ex-husband\nseemed to be slipping away into one of his hopeless moods. \u201cThe moral is that\nunlawful conduct does pay,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see how any of us could go home\nto our children and say it does not.\u201d He sat at his desk. He looked like a man\noutdoors in very cold weather who was concentrating hard on staying warm. ?\n\nPublished in the print edition of the January 11, 1993, issue.\n\nJohn Seabrook has been a contributor to The New Yorker since 1989 and became a\nstaff writer in 1993.
