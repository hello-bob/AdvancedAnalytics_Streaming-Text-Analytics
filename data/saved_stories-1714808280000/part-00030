Competitive production methods. U.S. Navy\noperations. These aren\u2019t just major milestones in history \u2014 surprisingly,\nthey\u2019re also key moments in the evolution of project management.\n\nThough many of us may hear the phrase \u201chistory of project management\u201d and\ninstinctively shy away, it\u2019s actually a journey grounded in innovation and\ntwists. Some of the biggest breakthroughs in construction, manufacturing, and\ntechnology all led to (or evolved from) huge shifts in the project management\nspace.\n\nSee where the roots of project management lie to understand how they tie in to\nthe future.\n\nThe roots of project management begin with planning coordinated efforts in\nlarge groups\n\nTo truly see the beginning of project management, look all the way back toward\nancient history. The origins of project management (and the tools most of us\nuse on a daily basis) started with the massive construction undertakings in\nearly civilizations.\n\nThe Great Pyramids of Giza in Egypt are widely considered the first major\ninstance of organizing and managing projects in a formal way. This was a huge\nfeat (even seen as impossible) requiring planning, coordinated efforts, and\nproject timelines to successfully complete.\n\nLook beyond the pyramids: the Roman Colosseum, the Great Wall of China \u2014 each\nof these projects required huge groups of people with different specialties to\nwork together to accomplish a substantial goal.\n\nAnd in order to complete these projects, people naturally started to split the\nend goal into numerous parts and milestones. To stay on schedule, they had to\nplan ahead and divide into teams working on different tasks, which had never\nbeen done on such a massive scale before. These early projects signaled that\nwith teamwork and project planning, huge things become possible.\n\nIn 2013, a joint team of French and Egyptian archaeologists discovered\nhundreds of inscribed papyrus fragments, including a logbook written more than\n4,500 years ago. It detailed the construction operations for the Great Pyramid\nand the work at the limestone quarries at Tura on the opposite bank of the\nNile River.\n\nMerer\u2019s logbook, written in a two-column daily timetable, reported on the\ndaily lives of the construction workers and how they transported the limestone\nblocks used to cover the pyramid\u2019s exterior by boat along the Nile River and a\nsystem of canals to the construction site.\n\nSource\n\nMore structured project planning emerges for intricate, repeatable endeavors\n\nThe next noteworthy milestone in project management history took place during\nthe Industrial Revolution. As an era of intricate construction projects, a\nhigher level of planning became critical, setting the stage for project\nmanagement to further evolve.\n\nIn earlier years, project management was primarily about organizing large\ngroups of people to collaborate on major initiatives. But with the rise of\nfactories and mass production, the goal changed slightly \u2014 to do things like\nconstruct a network of railways or build a factory with assembly lines\nproducing the same quality product again and again, an entire symphony of\nmoving parts had to be conducted through planning and strategy.\n\nFactories and assembly line production were, of course, breakthroughs for\nmanufacturing. But they also fundamentally shaped project management.\nSpecifically, the assembly line introduced the concept of breaking down\ncomplex tasks into smaller, manageable steps, a hallmark of modern project\nmanagement. And today, breaking down tasks is still a signature piece of\npopular methodologies, like Waterfall and Agile.\n\nThis diagram illustrates how Ford Motor Company's massive River Rouge Plant\nturned coal, iron ore, limestone, rubber, and sand into iron, steel, tires,\nglass, and finished automobiles. Ford Rouge Plant Pictorial Flow Chart,\n\"Complete Car Can Be Built in 28 Hours,\" 1940.\n\nSource\n\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, huge building accomplishments were\ncompleted, from the First Transcontinental Railroad in the United States\n(completed in 1869) to the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge in 1883. Like\nsome of those earlier construction projects, these required planning,\ncoordination, and teamwork, but on a more advanced scale.\n\nThough modern project management techniques weren\u2019t at play yet, these events\nplayed a crucial role in shaping the evolution of project management concepts.\nThey highlighted the need for structured planning, resource allocation,\ncoordination, and communication to manage increasingly complex and large-scale\nendeavors during the Industrial Revolution.\n\nBefore we discuss those familiar methodologies like Agile and Waterfall, the\nfirst formal management strategies blossomed in the late 19th to early 20th\ncentury, especially as Frederick Winslow Taylor (known as the \u201cfather of\nscientific management\u201d) introduced his principles of efficiency and time\nmanagement in the workplace. Taylor\u2019s main focus was on the manufacturing\nprocess, but his principles were a precursor for modern project management\nconcepts, too.\n\nFor Taylor, the goal of all management is maximum prosperity for the employer\nand each employee. In other words, project management should benefit everyone,\nnot just one side or the other \u2014 thus, collaboration and communication are\nessential.\n\nTaylor\u2019s various principles come together into Taylorism, the science of\ndelegating and dividing tasks between employees to increase efficiency.\nTaylorism, though efficient, has its flaws, particularly the way it treats\nemployees as nothing more than cogs in a great machine. But on a basic level,\nTaylorism explains why teams have specific procedures and processes for tasks,\ndelegate responsibilities and share work, break large projects into subtasks,\nand monitor performance. And in time, Taylorism would be the basis of\nmethodologies that allowed for changes and flexibility, like Gantt charts and\nKanban boards.\n\nThe \u201cFather of Scientific Management\u201d develops initial strategies for\nincreased efficiency and time management\n\nA way to spot dependencies \u2014 \u201cwhat if\u201d model planning emerges through Gantt\ncharts\n\nTaylorism didn\u2019t recognize one key piece of the project management puzzle:\nwhat happened when the tasks on each person\u2019s plate started to impact the\nothers \u2014 if one was held up, how would the team move forward with the others?\nIf one part of the project needed to shift, would it have a domino effect on\nother areas?\n\nBetween 1910 and 1915, Henry Gantt set out to create a solution for these\n\u201cwhat-if\u201d questions. He created the Gantt chart, effectively a horizontal bar\nchart with project schedules and timelines. These were visual representations\nof a project\u2019s schedule, tasks, and progress, which allowed managers to better\nplan and allocate resources. Unlike Taylor, who focused on efficiency above\nall else, Gantt prioritized people in addition to efficiency \u2014 by showcasing\noverlap and dependencies, managers could better delegate and support team\nmembers in completing projects.\n\nGantt increases visibility into bottlenecks and dependencies, giving project\nowners the opportunity to predict issues in advance. In turn, this has a\ndownstream effect of preventing delays and missed deadlines. That\u2019s why the\nGantt chart is especially useful for large-scale projects, and was even used\nto plan the process of building the iconic Empire State Building.\n\nA model of an original simple Gantt chart. According to Gantt himself, \u201cIf a\npromise of a delivery is to be kept, all the work in a plant must be planned\nso accurately that when a new order is received, it is possible to tell almost\nto a day when the work will be completed. The Gantt progress chart enables the\nmanager to keep before him all the promises he has made, to concentrate his\nattention on overcoming obstacles and avoiding delays, and, when it is\nimpossible to live up to a promise, it enables him to give the customer\nadvance notice of the fact.\u201d\n\nSource: 1. Clark, W., 1922. The Gantt Chart. The Ronald Press Co., New York.\n\nThe Gantt chart was especially helpful for large-scale projects, and was even\nused to plan the process of building the Empire State Building.\n\nSource\n\nThe first Gantt charts were hand-drawn, which was challenging because one\nchange would require you to remake the entire chart. When the computer and\nprograms like Excel came about, technology elevated the Gantt chart to be easy\nto update, and today, Gantt charts are a core digital feature of almost all\nproject management softwares.\n\nGantt was the first real formal visualization strategy for planning projects.\nAnd though Gantt was successfully being used across multiple industries\n(including by the American army during World War I) for timeline planning and\nresource allocation, for some companies, thinking through a workflow in stages\nmade more sense. Project management evolved over time because people had more\nspecific needs for planning, and created new solutions (often built onto those\nthat came before). So while many people continue to use Gantt charts, others\nwanted to create a visual workflow planning system where you could move tasks\nfrom one \u2018status\u2019 to the next in real time.\n\nKanban provides clear visuals of tasks and their status to smooth bottlenecks\nand delays\n\nEnter kanban (Japanese: \u770b\u677f, meaning signboard or billboard). Taiichii Ohno\noriginally developed the kanban for Toyota automotive in Japan in the early\n1940s. Ohno created kanban as a direct competitive strategy responding to\nHenry Ford\u2019s mass production model. Kanban was a simple planning system to\noptimize work and manage inventory through each stage of production. With\nkanban, teams were able to visualize the flow of work from start to finish and\nlimit the tasks currently in progress, ensuring a smoother transition of work\nfrom one stage to the next.\n\n\u770b\u677f\n\n\u304b\u3093\u3070\u3093\n\nkanban\n\nYears later, people started to think the kanban methodology could work for\nmore than just factory production. In 2004, David J. Anderson was the first to\napply the concept of kanban to IT, software development, and knowledge work.\nHe built on numerous project and production methods to identify the kanban\nmethod for knowledge work, with concepts like pull systems, querying theory,\nand flow.\n\nThough today, most kanban boards are inside project management tools or other\ndigital software programs, the original kanban Ohno created was a more\nphysical representation of all the work to-be-done, in progress, and\ncompleted. This photo shows the storage area for each kanban in the Toyota\nfactory\u2019s Motomachi Plant. Different sections of the kanban described which\nand how many parts are used where and when. By producing parts in accordance\nwith the instructions on the kanban, they could deliver parts among the\ndifferent plants only in the volumes needed. They could also eliminate\ninventories within each process. As kanban came into widespread use, problems\nsuch as standardization of work and transport management were resolved one\nafter another and production lines operated smoothly. The new kanban\nmanagement system was adopted at all Toyota plants in 1963.\n\nSource\n\nPeople need a way to identify key steps and the shortest route to a successful\nproject with CPM and PERT\n\nThe 1900s exemplify the snowball effect: one methodology after another\ndeveloped in quick succession, first Gantt, then Kanban \u2014 and in the 1950s,\ntwo more project management methodologies emerged, each identifying key steps\nin a project and the shortest path to success. But surprisingly, these two\nsimilar methodologies emerged almost simultaneously in very different\nenvironments: in the corporate world and in the military.\n\nFirst was the Critical Path Method (CPM), a mathematical technique for\nidentifying the most critical tasks in a project, and determining the shortest\npossible time needed to complete the project successfully. The DuPont and\nRemington Rand corporations independently developed the CPM in the late 1950s.\nCPM was actually used to plan plutonium production during the Manhattan\nproject. Later, in 1966, CPM was finalized as a formal methodology and used in\nbuilding the World Trade Center\u2019s Twin Towers in New York.\n\nTo apply CPM to a project, it had to have a well-defined set of tasks that\ncould be started and completed independently, but in a specific order. Most\npeople overestimate how important tasks are, especially considering on\naverage, only about 10% of the jobs in large projects are actually critical.\nThis method allows managers to identify those truly essential pieces. In\nmodern times, Gantt charts are a common way to visualize the information\nidentified with CPM.\n\nAround the same time, the Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) was\ndesigned to manage complex projects in the defense and aerospace industries.\nSimilar to the CPM, this method focused on estimating time and resource\nrequirements for each task in a project, but often for military operations.\nPERT was developed in the late 1950s by the United States Navy to manage\nweapons and defense projects.\n\nFor each project, the PERT calculates three time estimates: the shortest\npossible amount of time each task takes, the most probable amount of time, and\nthe longest amount possible. Instead of identifying critical steps and\nplanning accordingly (like with CPM), with PERT, a project manager would work\nbackwards from a set end date and analyze project tasks to set a budget,\nallocate resources, and ensure a project is doable in a set amount of time.\n\nThe cover of the original published work outlining the PERT \u2014 this one is\nparticularly interesting because it highlights the name change from \u201cProgram\nEvaluation Research Task\u201d to \u201cProgram Evaluation Review Technique.\u201d\n\nSource\n\nProject management is now recognized as its own field with its own body of\nknowledge\n\nThough we\u2019d already seen both informal applications and some more formal\nmethodologies emerge, up until this point, project management itself wasn\u2019t\nreally recognized as a field or profession. In 1969, after months of ongoing\nconversations, five individuals decided to form the first real organization\nfor project managers to share information and discuss problems: the Project\nManagement Institute, or PMI.\n\nEventually, in 1996, this organization published the Project Management Body\nof Knowledge, which became a fundamental reference for best practices in the\nfield. Today, the PMBOK is on its sixth edition and counting, frequently being\nupdated with best practices and technological advancements. Because project\nmanagement is constantly evolving and changing, especially as new methods\ndevelop and become commonplace, the PMBOK helps keep project managers in the\nloop on what\u2019s new. That way, teams can work in the most efficient ways\npossible, making use of what\u2019s current and evolving in the space.\n\nA photo of four out of five founders of the PMI. The five founders, James\nSnyder, Eric Jenett, Gordon Davis, E.A. \"Ned\" Engman and Susan C. Gallagher,\ncame together for the first formal meeting at Georgia Institute of Technology\nin Atlanta, Georgia, USA, on 9 October 1969, before filing the PMI Articles of\nIncoporation a while later in Pennsylvania.\n\nSource\n\nMore specific methodologies focus on collaboration, customer feedback, and\ncontinuous improvement\n\nNow that there was a formal professional organization and book of knowledge in\nplace, people focused on identifying the best ways to finish projects and\ncollaborate. New and more collaborative project management methodologies\nstarted to develop, and three major methodologies came out of this time\nperiod: Lean, Waterfall, and Agile. Each is used for a specific purpose, and\nwas born out of the shortcomings of a previous methodology. The more important\na specific need became, the easier it was to create a new collaboration method\nto address it.\n\nLean\n\nThe Lean methodology, which arose out of the Toyota manufacturing developments\nof the mid-1900s (yes, like kanban!) was another example of lasting project\nmanagement methods stemming from the manufacturing process. With lean\ndevelopment, the focus is on maximizing value and reducing waste, especially\nfor projects with clearly defined scope and repeatable, standardized\nprocesses.\n\nSource\n\nWaterfall\n\nWinston W. Royce first created the Waterfall method in 1970, in a paper titled\n\"Managing the Development of Large Software Systems.\u201d With the waterfall style\nof project management, managers break projects down into linear, sequential\nstages, with each step dependent on all the ones completed before. This method\nonly works for projects with specific phases \u2014 every stage of the project must\nbe completed before the next begins, which means you can\u2019t go back or work on\nmultiple elements simultaneously.\n\nSource\n\nAgile\n\nAlthough many people embraced (and still use) the waterfall methodology, some\npeople craved a more adaptable, flexible method with the same principles in\nmind. Thus, the Agile methodology was born: a better fit for continuous\nreleases and development, this approach to managing software development\nprojects focuses on incorporating customer feedback and constantly iterating.\n\nSource\n\nWhile the waterfall method requires you to complete each step before moving to\nthe next, the Agile method allows you to work on components simultaneously and\nincrementally, allowing teams to adjust processes and stay flexible,\nespecially with changing priorities. Surprisingly, the Agile methodology\nwasn\u2019t officially documented until 2001, so it\u2019s a more recent development\nmany teams use today. And as a descendant of those previous methodologies,\nAgile incorporates their best components very successfully: over 70% of U.S.\ncompanies are now using Agile.\n\nAs the 20th century progressed, the way people used technology began to\nevolve. By the 1980s, computers at work and at home were much more common, and\ndevelopers were creating localized software programs to be installed and\nstored on individual computers.\n\nThough most of us think of early computer programs as things like Microsoft\nPaint or even games like Pac-Man, this was also the time when project\nmanagement became computerized.\n\nAs people embraced a more digital era, tools were created for project managers\nto organize teams and projects on the computer. It started with spreadsheets \u2014\nat the time, Lotus 1-2-3 was the standard for spreadsheet software. These were\na simple solution for many project managers.\n\nBut soon, specific project management tools emerged, starting with Microsoft\nProjects. Other tools included Plantrac, PMS-II, Pertmaster, Hornet,\nMicroGantt, IntePert, Time Line, MacProject, PacMicro, Trakker, AMS Time\nMachine, Harvard Project Manager, Primavera, Scitor, Qwiknet, SuperProject,\nPromis, OpenPlan, MicroPlanner. Microsoft Projects and other softwares made\nproject management methodologies digital and easier to update, including\ncritical path method and Gantt charts.\n\nThese programs laid a path to the modern tools seen and used most today \u2014 as\nthese early tools emerged, they empowered project managers to identify project\nintricacies and critical milestones, better allocate resource, and accurately\nestimate costs. Today, more advanced project management tools layer onto those\nfoundational benefits, with more collaborative elements and real-time updates\nbuilt in.\n\nAn original screengrab from the 1984 version of Microsoft Projects.\n\nSource\n\nLotus 1-2-3, at one time the golden program for creating spreadsheets.\n\nSource\n\nTechnological advancements lead to the development of project management\nsoftware and tools\n\nCloud- and internet-based project management makes collaboration possible from\nanywhere\n\nAfter so many new project management methodologies emerged in the 1900s and\nlocal project management tools started to be commonplace in the early 2000s,\nthe next natural evolution was bringing teams together to collaborate in real\ntime online. From their earliest explorations to being fully developed and\nused around the world, the internet and the cloud transformed project\nmanagement.\n\nThe Internet allows people to connect from afar\n\nIn the 1960s, computer scientists started working on the \u201cAdvanced Research\nProjects Agency Network\u201d or ARPANET, a very primitive version of the internet.\n\nThough the internet\u2019s roots started in the \u201860s, its official birthday is\nJanuary 1, 1983. In the 1980s, home computer use started to blossom, and by\nthe \u201890s, people were using Web 1.0, the first publicly accessible version of\nthe World Wide Web. It was a static, read-only version of the web, where users\nmainly could view and read content \u2014 a much less interactive and collaborative\nversion of today\u2019s internet.\n\nIn the early 2000s, broadband internet access through DSL and cable allowed\npeople to access the internet at faster speeds, and it grew like wildfire. In\n1996, approximately 45 million people used the Internet; by 2004, the number\nrose to between 600 and 800 million users. And as the internet took off,\nproject management went online.\n\nWith online project management tools, information was always accessible. They\nalso solved some of the core challenges that had, historically, always\naccompanied managing projects. Instead of manually having to recreate paper\nproject timelines for one shift in scheduling, additional ask, or delay,\nupdates became instant and effortless online. Project management became more\naccessible with digital storage, and even became more secure with the cloud\nreplacing traditional on-premise systems.\n\nLawrence Roberts, the first person to connect two computers, worked with\nscientist Leonard Kleinrock to develop computer networks at ARPA. In 1969, the\ntwo developed the first packet-switching network and successfully used it to\nsend messages to another site, and the ARPANET, forefather to the internet,\nwas born. Originally, it was only seen as a tool for academic engineers and\ncomputer scientists, and linked departments at several American universities.\n\nSource\n\nProject MAC IBM 7094, 545 Tech Square, 9th Floor\n\nSource\n\nThe cloud paves the way for real-time collaboration\n\nThe cloud started, in its initial form, when the Defense Advanced Research\nProjects Agency (DARPA) gave researchers at MIT funding for Project MAC. This\nfunding came with multiple requirements, the most important of which was an\nemphasis on collaboration.\n\nResearchers needed to come up with a way for multiple people to use a computer\nsimultaneously. Eventually, the researchers came up with a large (now, likely\nseen as archaic) computer with reels of magnetic tape for memory \u2014 and it\nbecame the precursor for cloud computing, functioning as a primitive cloud\nwith two to three people accessing it.\n\nThis precursor for cloud computing paved the way for future project management\ntools being fully cloud-based, with multiple people collaborating from afar in\nreal time \u2014 it showed that even in the cloud\u2019s earliest stages, the need for\ncollaboration was seen as highly critical.\n\nOn an implementation level, cloud-based project management tools had huge\nbenefits: cost savings, less hardware and installs, faster software updates,\nmore user-friendly and easy to start with than other programs, connectivity\nwith other tools, and the ability to work from on-the-go instead of just at\nthe office. Tools like Jira and Pivotal Tracker built on the agile methodology\nand brought it to the cloud-based, digital age, revolutionizing the way people\nwere able to manage projects as a team.\n\nAnd later, software tools like Asana, ClickUp, and Notion emerged between 2008\nand 2018 to bring more of the team into the fold (instead of only the project\nmanager using the software) and make real-time collaboration more accessible.\nThese tools offered options built onto the roots of project management, like\ninstantly updatable kanban boards and Gantt charts, or templates for methods\nlike waterfall and agile.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nAutonomous project management\n\nProject management has evolved over time, and will continue to change in the\nyears to come. In the present day, there are hundreds of project tools, all\nbuilt on that rich project management history. From the early paper-based tool\nstack (papyrus scrolls, ink, and hand-drawn Gantt charts), to digital software\nused today, project management always set out to solve specific workflow\nproblems. And now, a new era of project management is beginning \u2014 and with it,\nnew challenges to solve.\n\nOne of the biggest of these challenges has been time wasted and manual effort.\nAs project data migrated to online digital tools, teams started to spend more\ntime chasing information and keeping those tools up-to-date than actually\nbuilding or creating. Knowledge workers waste one hour a day digging through\ncloud storage systems, scouring message systems, and cycling through tabs \u2014\nthat\u2019s 250 hours in a year, or over a full month of work.\n\nArtificial intelligence is going to change that. Research from Gartner\npredicts that 80% of today\u2019s project management tasks will be eliminated\n(translation: automated) by 2030 by AI. And with the rise of powerful language\nlearning models (LLMs) like GPT-4, those innovations are quickly drawing\ncloser. Beyond the text generation solutions currently on the market, AI paves\nthe way for building decision engines that handle all the manual work of\nproject management autonomously. Someday soon, project management will become\nan automatic process happening in the background, so teams are always up-to-\ndate with current information and accurate project planning without the hours\nof work.\n\nAccording to the Harvard Business Review, key areas of project management will\nchange with AI: better project selection and prioritization; support for\nproject managers; improved and faster project definitions, planning, and\nreporting; virtual project assistants, and more. For example, a product team\nwill no longer need to worry about triaging bugs or refining backlogs. In\nshort, teams won\u2019t have to spend their time on the manual project management\nwork that drains a significant amount of bandwidth today.\n\nEssentially, project tools will move beyond just a place where teams log and\nmaintain project data themselves. Instead, autonomous project tools will\nempower teams to make strategic decisions and build incredible things, without\nbeing bogged down manually managing projects.\n\nFrom Gantt and Kanban to AI and autonomous collaboration, at Height, we\ncontinually draw inspiration from the rich history of project management, and\nthe evolution of collaborative work that\u2019s inspired numerous software tools.\nWe\u2019re building a fully autonomous project collaboration tool for builders,\nthat will handle the legwork of managing projects invisibly and automatically.\nThis new tool builds on years of essential history while propelling us into a\nnew future, where you\u2019ll never again have to manage a project yourself.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
