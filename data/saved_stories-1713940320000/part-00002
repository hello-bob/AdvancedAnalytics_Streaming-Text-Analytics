employees to prepare for a different market reality, because \u201cthings are not like they were 15-20 years ago.\u201d\n  * At a recent all-hands meeting, Raghavan said user behavior is changing, competition is heating up and regulation is becoming a bigger challenge.\n  * Raghavan said he\u2019s shortening the amount of time that his reports have to work on certain projects.\n\nIn this article\n\n  * GOOGL-0.01 (-0.01%)\n\nPrabhakar Raghavan, senior vice president at Google, speaks during the US\nConference of Mayors Winter Meeting in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Jan.\n17, 2024.\n\nJulia Nikhinson | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nWearing a hoodie with the words \u201cWe use Math\u201d on the front, Google search boss\nPrabhakar Raghavan had an important message for employees at an all-hands\nmeeting last month. But he first wanted them to settle in and get comfortable.\n\n\u201cGrab your boba teas,\u201d Raghavan told the crowd, gathered in a theater at the\ncompany\u2019s headquarters in Mountain View, California.\n\nRaghavan, who reports directly to CEO Sundar Pichai and leads key groups\nincluding search, ads, maps and commerce, was addressing Google\u2019s knowledge\nand information organization, which consists of more than 25,000 full-time\nemployees.\n\n\u201cI think we can agree that things are not like they were 15-20 years ago,\nthings have changed,\u201d Raghavan said, according to audio of the event obtained\nby CNBC. He was referring to the search industry, which Google has dominated\nfor two decades, emerging as one of the most profitable and valuable companies\non the planet along the way.\n\nRaghavan said Google\u2019s digital ad business had become \u201cthe envy of the world.\u201d\nHe noted that over the last three years, annual revenue has grown by more than\n$100 billion, exceeding Starbucks, Mazda and TikTok combined.\n\nAt a company long known across Silicon Valley for its free, gourmet lunches\nand endless on-campus perks, Raghavan\u2019s comments serve as the latest warning\nto employees that growth for Google is getting harder.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like life is going to be hunky-dory, forever,\u201d he said.\n\nOver roughly 35 minutes, Raghavan peppered his reality check address with\nsports metaphors and rallying cries.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a clear and present market reality, we need to twitch faster, like\nthe athletes twitch faster,\u201d he said.\n\nHe referenced heightened competition and a more challenging regulatory\nenvironment. Though he didn\u2019t name specific rivals, Google is facing pressure\nfrom the likes of Microsoft and OpenAI in generative artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cPeople come to us because we are trusted,\u201d Raghavan said. \u201cThey may have a\nnew gizmo out there that people like to play with but they still come to\nGoogle to verify what they see there because it is the trusted source and it\nbecomes more critical in this era of generative AI.\u201d\n\nRaghavan had some tangible changes to announce. He said the company plans to\nbuild teams closer to users in key markets, including India and Brazil, and\nrevealed that he\u2019s shortening the amount of time that his reports have to\ncomplete certain projects in an effort to move faster.\n\n\u201cThere is something to be learned from that faster-twitch, shorter wavelength\nexecution,\u201d he said.\n\nGoogle\u2019s cloud business has also instructed employees to move within shorter\ntimelines despite having fewer resources after cost cuts, sources with\nknowledge of the matter told CNBC.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO2:1702:17\n\nGoogle unveils custom Arm-based chips\n\nTechCheck\n\n\u201cWith a huge opportunity ahead, we\u2019re moving with velocity and focus,\u201d a\nGoogle spokesperson told CNBC, when asked to comment on Raghavan\u2019s address.\nThe spokesperson highlighted the addition of generative AI to search and\nimprovements in search quality, adding, \u201cThere\u2019s lots more to come.\u201d\n\nIn March, Google named company veteran Elizabeth Reid to the role of vice\npresident, leading search and reporting to Raghavan.\n\n## \u2018High highs and low lows\u2019\n\nIn many respects, Raghavan\u2019s tone was nothing new. Google has been in cost-\ncutting mode since early 2023, when parent Alphabet announced plans to\neliminate about 12,000 jobs, or 6% of the company\u2019s workforce. Job cuts have\ncontinued this year, with more layoffs in early 2024, and CFO Ruth Porat said\nin a memo last week that the company is restructuring its finance\norganization, a move that will involve additional downsizing.\n\nBut Raghavan is making clear that what\u2019s happening now isn\u2019t just a\ncontinuation of 2023. He noted that his group\u2019s last all-hands meeting was\nthree months ago, though for some it felt like three years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot go on in these last three months,\u201d consisting of \u201creally high\nhighs and low lows,\u201d he said.\n\nIn that time, Google introduced its AI image generator. After users discovered\ninaccuracies that went viral online, the company pulled the feature in\nFebruary. Google has been reorganizing to try and stay ahead in the AI arms\nrace as more users move away from traditional internet search to find\ninformation online.\n\nIn Alphabet\u2019s upcoming earnings report on Thursday, Wall Street is expecting a\nsecond straight quarter of year-over-year revenue growth in the low teens.\nWhile that marks an acceleration from the few quarters prior, the numbers are\nalso in comparison to some of Google\u2019s weakest reports on record.\n\nEven though Alphabet reported better-than-expected revenue and profit for the\nfourth quarter, ad revenue trailed analysts\u2019 projections, causing the\ncompany\u2019s shares to drop more than 6%. Meanwhile, the AI boom is forcing a\nrenewed focus on investments.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a new cost reality,\u201d Raghavan said. With generative AI, the company\nis \u201cspending a ton more on machines,\u201d he said.\n\nOrganic growth is slowing and the number of new devices coming into the world\n\u201cis not what it used to be,\u201d Raghavan said.\n\n\u201cWhat that means is our growth in this new operating reality has to be hard\nearned,\u201d he added.\n\nA smart phone displaying Google with Google Gemini in the background is being\nfeatured in this photo illustration in Brussels, Belgium, on February 8, 2024.\n\nJonathan Raa | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nRaghavan said that additional challenges are emerging as the company is\n\u201cnavigating a regulatory environment unlike anything we\u2019ve seen before.\u201d\n\nHe cited the European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act and said the company is\nstill learning what its obligations will be from the European Commission. The\nDMA, which officially became enforceable last month, aims to clamp down on\nanti-competitive practices among tech companies.\n\n\u201cThat does have its impact on us,\u201d Raghavan said.\n\nRaghavan urged employees to \u201cmeet this moment\u201d and \u201cact with urgency based on\nmarket conditions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be easy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut these are the moments and the history of\nindustries that will define us.\u201d\n\n## 120 hours a week\n\nRaghavan said Google has to address its \u201csystemic\u201d challenges and build \u201cnew\nmuscles that maybe we have let fall off for a bit.\u201d\n\nHe praised the teams working on Gemini, the company\u2019s main group of AI models.\nHe said they\u2019ve stepped up from working 100 hours a week to 120 hours to\ncorrect Google\u2019s image recognition tool in a timely manner. That helped the\nteam fix roughly 80% of the issues in just 10 days, he said.\n\nHowever, Google still hasn\u2019t brought back the ability to generate images of\npeople. Demis Hassabis, Google\u2019s AI leader, said in February after the tool\nwas taken down that it would be re-released in weeks.\n\nRaghavan clarified that the failure in image generation wasn\u2019t due to a lack\nof effort.\n\n\u201cI want to be clear, this wasn\u2019t some case of somebody slacking off and\ndropping the ball,\u201d he said.\n\nRaghavan said the company has shown the ability to move quickly on important\nmatters. As an example, he highlighted an effort in 2023, when the Bard team\n(now Gemini) and Magi team, which focuses on AI-powered search, launched\nproducts within a matter of months.\n\nIt was something the company couldn\u2019t have accomplished, he suggested, with\nbigger numbers.\n\n\u201cThe realization was \u2018gosh, if we had thrown 2,000 engineers at these\nprojects, we wouldn\u2019t have got it done,\u2019\u201d he said, indicating that the company\nwould be paying close attention to the size and scope of teams.\n\nRaghavan also spoke to critics of the company\u2019s bureaucracy.\n\nEmployees have complained for years that Google\u2019s growing bureaucracy has\ncrippled their ability to launch products quickly. That worsened as the\ncompany rapidly expanded its workforce during the pandemic.\n\nIn 2022, in addition to Google\u2019s annual survey called Googlegeist, Pichai\nlaunched a \u201cSimplicity Sprint\u201d to gather employee feedback on efficiency.\n\n\u201cThe number of agreements and approvals it takes to bring a good idea to\nmarket \u2014 that\u2019s not the Google way,\u201d Raghavan said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way we\nshould be functioning.\u201d\n\nRaghavan said leaders are actively working on removing unnecessary layers in\nthe hierarchy, echoing prior comments from Pichai.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned a lot the last few quarters,\u201d Raghavan said. \u201cI cannot tell you\nthat all the stumbles are behind us. What matters is how we respond and what\nwe learn.\u201d\n\n## Don\u2019t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO\n\n  * Here are Tuesday\u2019s biggest analyst calls: Nvidia, Tesla, Apple, Roblox, Tesla, Qualcomm, Disney & more\n  * Analysts love this gold explorer\u2019s stock \u2014 and even the most cautious expect it to soar 114%\n  * The stock market \u2018correction\u2019 is not over yet, JPMorgan\u2019s Kolanovic says\n  * \u2018Bargain\u2019 energy stocks: Morningstar strategist picks 5 to buy as oil prices slide\n  * When Tesla shares fall \u2014 these 6 stocks tend to rise, according to recent history\n  * Steer clear of Apple ahead of earnings, tech investor Dan Niles says\n\nWATCH: Google shifts culture\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO2:5602:56\n\nGoogle shifts culture, CEO notes \u2018this is a business\u2019\n\nTechCheck\n\nTV\n\nClosing Bell: OvertimeWATCH LIVEWATCH IN THE APP\n\nUP NEXT | Fast Money 05:00 pm ETListen\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
