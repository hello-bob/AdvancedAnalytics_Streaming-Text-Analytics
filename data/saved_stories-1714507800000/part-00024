When heated, vitrimer\nmolecules can break bonds and form new ones, which is an unusual\ncharacteristic for polymers. Vitrimer, or vitreous polymer, was first\nsynthesized in 2011, though practical uses for the material didn't emerge\nuntil later.\n\n\"We realized the vitrimer materials they've been developing are a perfect\nsolution for creating recyclable circuit boards, and that we had the potential\nto create a material with properties similar to industry standards to\naccelerate adoption,\" Iyer explained.\n\nThe process for making a vitrimer PCB (or vPCB as the researchers call it) is\nmostly the same as it is for a regular PCB \u2013 the only substantial difference\nis that vPCBs are completely cured while traditional designs are only semi-\ncured.\n\nWhen dipped into an organic solvent, the team found the solution transformed\nthe vitrimer in the vPCB into a \"jelly-like substance,\" making it swell in\nsize and separate from the glass and other components. The process doesn't\neven use a chemical reaction, making even the solvent recyclable.\n\nThe researchers say they could recover all of the glass for reuse, 98 percent\nof the vitrimer, and 91 percent of the solvent \u2013 which is a very respectable\nrate for recyclability.\n\nvPCBs also showed great promise for repairability, making it possible to fix\ndamage like cracked PCBs since the base materials can be separated. Vitrimer\nis fortunately resistant enough to heat for things like heat guns, which are\nused to melt solder on PCBs, to work properly on repairs.\n\n\"There's certainly room to make them more robust though,\" Iyer conceded. \"We\ncan tune the properties to make them [vitrimers] tolerate even higher\ntemperatures. Members of the team are currently developing AI tools to predict\nthe properties of new vitrimers with the hope of customizing them for target\napplications.\"\n\n### vPCBs might not even raise costs much, if at all\n\nThe biggest obstacle to using vitrimer right now (assuming it proves to be a\nworthy successor to plastic) is cost. Since the production method for vPCBs is\napparently mostly the same as typical PCBs, there won't be a price difference\nin that aspect \u2013 but using vitrimer instead of plastic could still be a\nfinancial obstacle.\n\n\"Our vitrimer PCBs are compatible with all of the standard processing used to\npattern and make circuits, so these costs should be similar,\" Iyer told us.\n\nThe researchers haven't yet analyzed the potential cost difference between\nthermosets and vitrimers, but Iyer is hopeful. \"We did however use off the\nshelf chemicals, and the processing steps here are largely the same as\nindustrially produced materials like epoxy (heating, stirring, etc) suggesting\nit has potential to be cost competitive at scale.\"\n\nOf course, those chemicals (an epoxide, acid, and a catalyst) will need to be\navailable in quantities sufficient to feed the PCB industry, which makes tens\nof millions of boards every year. That's where the additional cost comes in.\n\nOn the other hand, as vPCBs could be very recyclable, there could be savings\non reuse of materials, offsetting the initial cost.\n\nAs with all breakthroughs in studies though, it's uncertain whether the\nfindings will translate into real-world products. Given that Microsoft,\nGoogle, and Amazon funded the study (Microsoft even supplied a researcher), it\ndefinitely has potential to make it out of the lab and into actual\nelectronics. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Hardware\n  * Research\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Hardware\n  * Research\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Cisco ACE\n  * Digital advertising displays\n  * GPU\n  * Integrated Circuit\n  * Keyboard\n  * Legacy Technology\n  * Monitor\n  * PCIe\n  * Printer\n  * Trusted Platform Module\n  * USB\n\n#### More about\n\n3 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Hardware\n  * Research\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Hardware\n  * Research\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Cisco ACE\n  * Digital advertising displays\n  * GPU\n  * Integrated Circuit\n  * Keyboard\n  * Legacy Technology\n  * Monitor\n  * PCIe\n  * Printer\n  * Trusted Platform Module\n  * USB\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Microsoft really does not want Windows 11 running on ancient PCs\n\nEven tighter requirements, so it's time to put old hardware out to pasture...\nor find an alternative OS\n\nOSes7 days | 252\n\n#### Intel's neuromorphic 'owl brain' swoops into Sandia labs\n\nHala Point system crams more than a thousand neurochips into a 6U chassis to\ntackle real-time AI\n\nAI + ML13 days | 1\n\n#### Tough luck, bosses, AI is coming for your job, too\n\nAlgorithms as PHBs \u2013 who wouldn't want that?\n\nAI + ML25 days | 38\n\n#### Industrial systems integrating digitalisation\n\nHuawei solutions designed to speed up digital and intelligent transformation\nacross key vertical industries\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Boffins deem Google DeepMind's material discoveries rather shallow\n\nWeb titan rejects criticisms, insists AI-found compounds are legit\n\nAI + ML19 days | 21\n\n#### MIT breakthrough means there's no material too weird for 3D printing\n\nThanks to sensors and math, machines can 'learn' to adapt to new mediums\n\nOSes15 days | 18\n\n#### It's 2024 and Intel silicon is still haunted by data-spilling Spectre\n\nGo, go InSpectre Gadget\n\nResearch20 days | 23\n\n#### 96% of US hospital websites share visitor info with Meta, Google, data\nbrokers\n\nCould have been worse \u2013 last time researchers checked it was 98.6%\n\nResearch19 days | 13\n\n#### CHIPS Act hangover sees most US science agency budgets cut for 2024\n\n2025 unlikely to see more money flow as Congress turns off the tap\n\nPublic Sector20 days | 16\n\n#### ZenHammer comes down on AMD Zen 2 and 3 systems\n\nUpdated Boffins demonstrate Rowhammer memory meddling on AMD DDR4 hardware\n\nSoftware1 month | 9\n\n#### Intel Meteor Lake makes unexpected leap to socketed motherboards\n\nBut not, we repeat, not on the desktop\n\nPersonal Tech1 month |\n\n#### Truck-to-truck worm could infect \u2013 and disrupt \u2013 entire US commercial\nfleet\n\nThe device that makes it possible is required in all American big rigs, and\nhas poor security\n\nSecurity1 month | 74\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
