(Chris Carlson / AP Photo, File)\n\nAngela Dewan\n\nCNN\n\nDigital\n\nContact\n\nUpdated April 29, 2024 6:57 p.m. GMT\n\nPublished April 29, 2024 4:58 p.m. GMT\n\nShare\n\nMinisters from the Group of Seven nations have agreed to shut down all their\ncoal plants by 2035 at the latest, a U.K. minister said on Monday, in a\nclimate policy breakthrough that could influence other countries to do the\nsame.\n\nPutting an end date on coal \u2014 the most climate-polluting fossil fuel \u2014 has\nbeen highly controversial at international climate talks. Japan, which derived\n32% of its electricity from coal in 2023, according to the climate think tank\nEmber, has blocked progress on the issue at past G7 meetings, CNN has\npreviously reported.\n\n  * Top climate and environment headlines, all in one place\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe do have an agreement to phase out coal in the first half of the 2030s,\u201d\nAndrew Bowie, a U.K. minister at the Department for Energy Security and Net\nZero, told Class CNBC in Turing, Italy. \u201cThis is, by the way a historic\nagreement, something that we weren\u2019t able to achieve at COP28 in Dubai last\nyear.\u201d\n\n## RELATED STORIES\n\n  * Southeast Asian countries consider ways to boost 'green financing' as region chokes on smog\n\n  * Residents concerned about effects of climate change on Margaree River, N.S.\n\n  * As the climate changes, so too do Canadians' farm fields and dinner tables\n\n\u201cSo, to have the G7 nations come around the table to send that signal to the\nworld \u2014 that we, the advanced economies of the world are committed to phasing\nout coal by the early 2030s \u2014 is quite incredible.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to confirm the development, the U.K. Ministry for Energy and Net\nZero pointed CNN to the interview.\n\nThe U.S. State Department declined to comment on the G7 agreement. Last week,\nthe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced new rules that will require\ncoal-fired power plants to either capture nearly all of their climate\npollution or shut down by 2039.\n\n\u201cComing just days after the EPA released proposed new rules that will\nessentially lead to an accelerated phaseout schedule for most coal plants,\nthis G7 commitment is a further confirmation from the US that coal is on its\nway out sooner rather than later,\u201d said Katrine Petersen, a senior policy\nadvisor at climate think tank E3G.\n\nThe commitment is \u201ca major step forward in particular for Japan, as the only\nG7 country left without a commitment to move away from coal,\u201d Petersen said.\n\nMany of the other G7 nations already have national plans in place to phase out\nthe fossil fuel. Around 16% of the G7s electricity comes from coal, Ember\nreports.\n\n\u201cThis is another nail in the coffin for coal,\u201d said Dave Jones, Ember\u2019s Global\nInsights program director. \u201cThe journey to phase out coal power has been long:\nit\u2019s been over seven years since the U.K., France, Italy and Canada committed\nto phase out coal power, so it\u2019s good to see the United States and especially\nJapan at last be more explicit on their intentions.\u201d\n\n  * Download the CTV News App for breaking news alerts and video on all the top stories\n\nHe warned, however, that while coal power has been falling, gas consumption\ncontinues. \u201cCoal might be the dirtiest, but all fossil fuels need to be\nultimately phased out,\u201d he said.\n\nFossil fuels are the main cause of the climate crisis. Almost every country in\nthe world agreed last year to transition away from fossil fuels at the COP28\nclimate talks in Dubai, but failing to put an end date on coal was seen as a\nshortcoming of those negotiations.\n\nEnergy, environment and climate ministers are meeting in Turin for talks that\nare expected to end on Tuesday.\n\nThe G7 \u2014 made up of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom\nand the United States, with the European Union as a member with special status\n\u2014 typically leads on global climate policy. The group\u2019s decisions often\ntrickle down or influence the wider G20, which includes other big emitters,\nlike China and India, as well as major fossil fuel producers, such as Saudi\nArabia and Russia.\n\nCNN\u2019s Ella Nilsen contributed to this report.\n\nReport an error\n\nEditorial standards & policies\n\nWhy you can trust CTV News\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## RELATED STORIES\n\n  * Southeast
