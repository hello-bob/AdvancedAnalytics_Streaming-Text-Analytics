Photo F. Schneider/picture-alliance/dp\n\nAncient Egyptian pyramids and the Great Sphinx in Giza were briefly shuttered\nto the public this week for a tech billionaire\u2019s wedding.\n\nThat billionaire, Ankur Jain, and fitness trainer Erika Hammond reportedly\npaid to have those sites closed down for their wedding, a weeklong celebration\nthat is estimated to have cost upward of $3 million. The event, which has\nsince gone viral on TikTok, offered guests a private tour of the pyramids and\nthe sphinx without interruption, as well as a close look at a statue of Ramses\nII.\n\nThe couple also hosted a party at the Grand Egyptian Museum, which is thought\nto be the largest constructed museum in the world devoted to a single\ncivilization. That institution, which cost $1 billion to build, is still not\nopen to the public, though it is expected to begin welcoming visitors later\nthis year.\n\n## Related Articles\n\n### Well-Preserved Frescoes Uncovered in a 'Black Room' Banquet Hall at\nPompeii\n\n### Late Medieval Helmet Discovered off the Coast of Abandoned Italian Island\n\nJain and Hammond wed at sunset between two of the pyramids before celebrating\nwith a star-studded reception with performances by Robin Thicke, Lance Bass,\nand Lindsey Stirling.\n\nAccounts of the wedding events have generated hearty debate across multiple\nsocial media platforms, with many claiming that the event was needlessly\nextravagant.\n\n> taxes need to be higher pic.twitter.com/ty3gwqP8LT\n>\n> \u2014 Armand Domalewski (@ArmandDoma) May 2, 2024\n\nJain is the founder and CEO of Bilt Rewards loyalty program.
