Now It Threatens Everything\n\nAncient prophecies of worlds destroyed by fire are becoming realities. How\nwill we respond?\n\nBy Stephen Pyne\n\nIn this image and those below, photographer Kevin Cooley captures the power\nand allure of fire.\n\nKevin Cooley\n\nWhen I was 18, a few days after graduating from high school, I found myself on\na forest fire crew at Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona. I returned for 15\nseasons, 12 as crew boss, and I became a pyromantic. For those years I lived\none life at a university and another on the canyon\u2019s North Rim. On a fire\ncrew, you quickly learn how fires can shape a season and how seasons can shape\na life. I found a way to reconcile my two lives and became a scholar on fire.\n\nMy first fire, in June 1967, was a lightning-blasted snag on Powell Plateau,\nan isolated mesa in the Grand Canyon. Fifty-six years later I\u2019ve written works\nabout fire on every continent, among them primary histories for the U.S.,\nCanada, Mexico, Australia and Europe, including Russia. My focus has been to\nchronicle the relationship between fire and humans, an alliance that has\nremade, and unhinged, the planet. Here\u2019s how that happened\u2014and how I think we\ncan restore balance.\n\nEarth is a fire planet, the only one we know of. Earth has fire because it has\nlife. Life created the oxygen fire needs; life created and arranges the fuel\nit requires. Even the chemistry of fire is a biochemistry: fire takes apart\nwhat photosynthesis puts together. As long as terrestrial life has existed, so\nhas fire.\n\nFire takes on some properties of the living world it depends on. In ways, it\nresembles a virus\u2014something not truly alive but that requires the living world\nto propagate. And like a virus, fire propagates by contagion.\n\nThe one requirement of fire that life did not furnish was ignition. That\nchanged with the appearance of a genus, now a single species, that could start\nfire at will: ours. Humans became unique fire creatures. We used fire to\nremake ourselves, and then we and fire remade Earth.\n\nWe developed more compact guts and big heads because we learned to cook food.\nWe went to the top of the food web because we learned to cook landscapes for\nhunting, foraging, farming and herding. And we have become a geological force\nbecause we\u2019ve begun to cook the planet. Becoming the keystone species for fire\nmade us the keystone species for Earth. Not only can we start (and, within\nlimits, stop) fire, but fire serves as a fulcrum for our desires, good and\nbad. The fire stick became an Archimedean lever with which we move the world.\n\nOur relationship with fire grew as we domesticated it. Fire had to be birthed,\nfed, trained, sheltered, tended\u2014we even have to clean up after it. For many\nintellectuals, from Roman architect Vitruvius to 20th-century French\nanthropologist Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, fire control separates the civilized from\nthe barbaric. Fire is also a core technology and a foundation for chemistry.\nWith fire we turn mud into brick and pottery, limestone into cement, sand into\nglass, ore into metal; fire always seems to exist somewhere in the life cycle\nof made things and in built environments. And working fires have illuminated,\nwarmed and powered almost all human activities from religious sacrifices to\nthe forging of weapons.\n\nIn a sense, early humans and fire made a pact for mutual assistance: each\nwould expand the realm of the other. People would carry fire to places and\ntimes in which it could not have existed otherwise. In return, fire empowered\nhumans to go everywhere and do far more than their primate ancestors could\never have imagined. If humans colonize other planets, they will leave Earth on\nplumes of flame.\n\nKevin Cooley\n\nYet limits existed. People and the flames they sparked were constrained by\nterrain, vegetative fuels and climate. Anthropogenic fire could alter some of\nthose conditions but not at a planetary scale. That began to change about\n12,000 years ago, at the end of the last glacial period. A fire-wielding\ncreature met an increasingly fire-receptive world. With tugs and yanks and\npositive feedback, a planetary makeover began that is rampant today. The\nHolocene epoch that followed the last glaciation is an Anthropocene or, given\nthe catalytic role of fire, a Pyrocene.\n\n## Related Stories\n\n  * ### China\u2019s Population Could Shrink to Half by 2100\n\nLex Rieffel & Xueqing Wang\n\n  * ### Early Humans Sheltered in This Lava Tube 10,000 Years Ago\u2014And It\u2019s Still in Use Today\n\nGillian Dohrn & Nature magazine\n\n  * ### To Ancient Maya, Solar Eclipses Signified Clashing Gods\n\nKimberly H. Breuer & The Conversation US\n\n  * ### Ancient Egyptian Mummies Reveal What Diseases Plagued the Civilization\n\nSara Novak\n\nThe Pyrocene, a concept and term I created several years ago, is an\ninterpretation of Earth\u2019s fire history as an amalgam of three fires. I\u2019ll use\nthe U.S. to illustrate this idea.\n\n\u201cFirst fire\u201d is nature\u2019s fire. Geologists have found fossil charcoal that is\nmore than 420 million years old. Lightning was overwhelmingly the ignition\nsource. Yet by the time the 1880 U.S. census mapped forest fires across the\ncountry, there was little overlap between lightning-kindled fires and the many\nburns on the ground. Humans were responsible for the vast majority of the\nburning. Indigenous peoples used fire for hunting, foraging, fishing and\ngeneral land maintenance; fire could render landscapes more habitable.\nNewcomers, too, had a fire heritage that they hauled across the Atlantic, one\nembedded in agriculture and pastoralism. With contact between peoples, the\nfires of the two groups met and merged. Native practices better adapted to\nlocal sites were often adopted or modified to accommodate livestock and new\ncrops. But even though people working the land never doubted the value of fire\nin sustaining their livelihoods, elites in the New World often echoed those of\nthe Old World who distrusted and feared fire as messy, dangerous and wasteful,\na stigma of primitivism.\n\nThese human-handled fires constitute a \u201csecond fire,\u201d which is first fire\ndomesticated, or at least tamed, and used to create a landscape more amenable\nto human habitation. Compare the 1880 geography of fires to that of human\nsettlement, and you\u2019ll find they overlay almost perfectly.\n\nThe new settlers came amid a first wave of European expansion. Usually this\nsprawl is considered in terms of political and economic imperialism. But there\nwas a parallel expansion of plants, animals, diseases and peoples that rewrote\nfire regimes. The demographic collapse of Indigenous people in the Americas\nwas particularly catastrophic. Spanish conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s noted in a\n1520 letter to Spain\u2019s Holy Roman Emperor Charles V that \u201cnot a palm\u201d of land\n(in central Mexico) was untended. Yet as much as 90 percent of those tenders\ndisappeared during the 16th century. A partly domesticated, often feral land\nreplaced the one they had cared for. This upheaval followed plagues and wars\nthat swept Eurasia. Millions of people died, and millions of trees grew.\nResearchers are exploring how this global swap might have influenced the\nLittle Ice Age that ended in the 19th century.\n\nA second wave of fire expansion began in the late 18th century. This time, in\naddition to transporting plants and animals, ships carried ideas about fire\nthat proved mighty in refashioning Earth. A scientific revolution\u2014the\ndiscovery of oxygen in 1774\u2014deconstructed fire into a chemical reaction called\ncombustion. \u201cFire\u201d lost its siting in landscapes and its mythical status as a\nfundamental element and became a subdiscipline of physics, chemistry and\nmechanical engineering. Combustion was rational and modern, landscape fire\nprimitive and backward.\n\nThis scientific redefinition aligned with a technological revolution aimed at\nfashioning new engines of fire, which gave people unparalleled power.\nRevealingly, the earliest steam engines\u2014such as those created by pioneering\ninventors Thomas Newcomen and James Watt in the 1700s\u2014were used to pump water\nout of coal mines, clearing the way to more fuel for the machines. Steam\nengines and their voracious progeny helped to disseminate Europe\u2019s\nunderstanding of fire and the machines that exploited it. Wherever possible,\nthe new firepower replaced the old, much as gas lighting and, later, electric\nbulbs did candles, and traditional knowledge and practices were condemned,\nreplaced or suppressed. What happened in industrial Europe also happened in\nits colonies. Thousands of years of empirical fire experience, coded in lore,\nstory, song lines and oral wisdom, were dismissed, in effect dissolving\nhumanity\u2019s hard-won understanding of how fire works in thousands of\nlandscapes.\n\nThank you for signing up!\n\nCheck out our other newsletters\n\nThis conversion to combustion chambers, especially when used to burn fossil\nfuels, created the \u201cthird fire\u201d that dominates the planet today.\n\nThe transition from burning living landscapes to burning lithic (fossil)\nlandscapes constituted something new under the sun. Humanity\u2019s quest for fire\nhad always been about finding new stuff to burn and new ways to burn it. Now\nthe issue was not sources; new reserves of fossil fuels kept being discovered\n(and still are today). The problem concerned sinks: there was no place to put\nall the effluent. Fire in living landscapes had evolved with checks and\nbalances that could, within limits, be stretched. Third fire had no such\necological fetters. It could burn day and night, winter and summer, through\nwet and dry spells. Humanity had suddenly unshackled Prometheus. Its firepower\nwas all but unbounded.\n\nThe transition toward fossil fuels as a source of primary energy is regarded\nas a fundamental driver of global change and has birthed an exponentially\nincreasing body of fire scholarship. Yet as dramatic as its consequences seem,\nthird fire is the latest phase change in an unbroken narrative of humanity and\nfire. This connectedness is part of the value in viewing the Anthropocene\nthrough a pyric prism. It is my particular contribution to the thinking about\nfire.\n\nKevin Cooley\n\nThe competition between first and second fire expanded to include third fire.\nI call this shift the pyric transition because the demographics of fire seem\nto have emulated those of people as they underwent industrialization. Humanity\nhas used its firepower to remake all its habitats, one after another. That\nthird fire abolishes open fire has been taken by Western elites as a measure\nof modernity. To them, flame is slovenly, backward, even atavistic, tolerable\nonly when used for ceremonial purposes. Working fires are those that are\nhoused in machines.\n\nSo fire has disappeared in many domestic settings, sublimated into\nelectricity. It has disappeared in urban environments. Historically, cities\nburned as often as their surrounding countryside; after all, they were made of\nthe same materials and responded equally to drought and wind. Perhaps the\nbest-known example is the swarm of fires that, on October 8, 1871, burned both\nthe city of Chicago and the town of Peshtigo, Wis., amid a million acres of\ncharred forest around Lake Michigan. But modern cities are designed not to\nburn, made of materials that have already passed through flames to become\ncement, glass and metal and then been arranged in ways that retard fire\u2019s\nspread.\n\nA similar process has occurred in agriculture. The green revolution is about\nnot just clever breeding but the \u201cinputs\u201d that amplify plant growth. Whereas\nopen fire converted dead biomass into nutrients and purged sites of pests and\ncompeting plants, modern agriculture relies on petrochemicals that get cooked\ninto fertilizer and biocides and delivered by pumps, planes and tractors\npowered by fossil fuels. Fallow\u2014potentially arable land left \u201cidle\u201d during the\ngrowing season\u2014fell out of favor. European agronomists and officials had\nalways hated fallow, which they regarded as a waste of good land, and burning\nof these fields added insult. Yet fallowing contributed to agriculture\u2019s\nbiodiversity.\n\nMost spectacularly, the pyric transition extended into remote lands\u2014forest\nreserves, nature preserves, the distant bush, the outback. Officials applied\nthe new counterforce made possible by third fire and sought to abolish flame\nin wildlands as they had in other habitats.\n\nThere are good reasons to eliminate flames (and their inevitable smoke) in\nhouses and cities. Few residents would want them back except as an occasional\namenity. But pushing that change into the countryside and backcountry is\ndifferent. The provocation was a wave of megafires during the late 1800s and\nearly 1900s that were larger and more lethal than those of previous decades.\nLocomotives opened land to logging and clearing, which covered landscapes with\ncombustible slash, over which trains scattered sparks from their smokestacks\nand brakes with abandon. The wreckage unleashed by fire and axe inspired\nstate-sponsored conservation\u2014a global project to protect landscapes,\nespecially forests, from destruction. Between 1891 and 1905 the U.S. began\nreserving forests, granted them a charter and established an institution, the\nU.S. Forest Service, to administer it all.\n\nThe consensus wisdom was that such fires were intolerable. Bernhard Fernow, an\n\u00e9migr\u00e9 forester from Prussia who headed the Division of Forestry (predecessor\nto the Forest Service), dismissed the spectacle as one of \u201cbad habits and\nloose morals,\u201d unworthy of an aspiring great power. Gifford Pinchot, first\nchief of the Forest Service, likened the challenge of fire protection to the\nabolition of slavery. Their views were typical of forestry that had emerged\nfrom central Europe, which saw fire as a metric of social behavior. They\nregarded fires as they might malaria or banditry: the world would be better\noff without them.\n\nAs emissaries of modernity, foresters dismissed traditional fire knowledge and\npractice. Fire control became foundational to conservation, a global project\nthat ranged from the Rocky Mountains of North America to the Central Provinces\nof India. Foresters in the U.S. made \u201csystematic fire control\u201d their special\ncontribution to world forestry.\n\nKevin Cooley\n\nThey went at it with extraordinary verve and resolve. Burned area decreased\nsharply, especially after World War II, aided by immense stocks of war-surplus\nhardware converted for firefighting. Industrial-scale fire protection thus\nbecame another marker in the Great Acceleration in global change. In the U.S.,\nthe burning of living landscapes plunged as the burning of lithic landscapes\nbolted upward. The period between the mid-1940s and the mid-1980s was a sweet\nspot in which technology and active suppression shrank free-burning fires to a\npittance. Third fire overwhelmed first and second fire.\n\nBy the 1960s the ecological blowback was apparent. Wildlands are not cities;\nfuels build up, threatening to stoke uncontrollable conflagrations. Ecosystems\nrot, choked by the absence of fire\u2019s renewing spark. Between 1968 and 1978,\nfederal agencies reformed their policy from suppression-only to a mixed\nprogram centered on restoring good fire.\n\nNote that all this happened before any wide concern about climate change.\nSince then, global warming, like a performance enhancer, has added energy to\nfire\u2019s expression, and it has globalized the consequences. Even places that\nhave not attempted the pyric transition feel its effects.\n\nLike the pyric transition, the shift in fire-management approach happened\nquickly. After the Great Fires of 1910\u2014which burned three and a quarter\nmillion acres in northern Idaho and western Montana, part of five million\nacross the West\u2014the U.S. spent 50 years trying to take all fire out of its\nlandscapes and then another 50 trying to put good fire back in. The\naftershocks promise to continue for a long while.\n\nLet\u2019s widen our aperture and consider fire\u2019s big history. As long as Earth has\nhad terrestrial vegetation, it has had first fire. Second fire appeared in the\nPleistocene epoch, competing with first fire. During the Holocene epoch, which\nbegan approximately 11,700 years ago, people used fire to recode the patches\nand pulses of fire across the planet. Third fire arrived over the past two\ncenturies. Its geography is different because it includes an axis of deep\ntime. We are taking stuff out of the geological past, burning it in the\npresent and loosing its effluent into the future. Initially third fire\ncompeted with first and second fire; more recently, as a result of humans\u2019\noverloading the atmosphere with greenhouse gases and promoting changes in land\nuse, third fire has amplified any kind of fire on the land.\n\nEarth is dividing into two realms of combustion. One burns living landscapes;\nthe other burns lithic landscapes. Satellite views of Earth at night show the\ntwo realms clearly: countrysides aflame, cities aglow. Consider the two\nKoreas, a cameo of Earth\u2019s pyrogeography. South Korea has made the pyric\ntransition and is ablaze with electric lights at night, whereas North Korea is\ndark but shows abundant landscape fires during the day. South Korea is also\nnow experiencing the wildfires typical of industrial nations, which it is\nfighting with third-fire-powered machines.\n\nPlenty of disasters can occur when the two realms of combustion meet; think of\npower lines that start blazes. My favorite contrast is Biosphere 2, a glassed-\nin, self-contained habitat in Arizona that could be plunked down on Mars. The\ngeodesic structure has a zero-tolerance policy for fire, yet it sits at the\nbase of the Santa Catalina Mountains, which experience fires that are both\nessential and inevitable (85 percent of the mountains burned in 2003 and\n2004). What may be most striking in this scene, and many others like it, is\nthe absence of any middle\u2014a middle ground or a middle narrative that shows\nhumans exercising their historic role as a fire agent and mediating between\nthese two otherwise exclusionary visions.\n\nWiden the aperture further. The Pleistocene\u2019s serial ice ages remade entire\nlandscapes, created continental shifts in biogeography, dramatically changed\nsea level and spawned serial extinctions. Boosted by the pyric transition,\nfire is assuming the position previously held by ice. Climate change fomented\nby third fire is driving off ice and remaking landscapes; it\u2019s causing\ncontinental shifts in biogeography, changes in sea level and a wave of\nextinctions. Instead of outwash plains, we have heat domes, and instead of\npermafrost, permathaw. The ice of the Pleistocene has yielded to the fires of\na Pyrocene.\n\nAnd the humans? Consider the inhabitants of Fort McMurray in Alberta, Canada.\nThey live in a modern city established to mine tar sands but sited in a boreal\nforest. In 2016 a fire, most likely ramped up by global warming, bolted out of\nthe bush, burned through the town, shut down Suncor\u2019s mining operations and\nthen continued untrammeled by any efforts to contain it. The residents fled in\ntheir petrol-powered vehicles. Fort McMurray\u2014a creation of our fire age. Fort\nMcMurray\u2014a place that burned both ends of its combustion candle. Fort\nMcMurray\u2014 a portal to the Pyrocene.\n\nToday we live in a fire age in which ancient prophecies of worlds destroyed\nand renewed by fire have become contemporary realities, even for people living\nin modern cities. In the summer of 2023 millions of residents of New York City\nand other metropolises saw dark-orange daytime skies thick with smoke palls\nfrom Canadian wildfires\u2014and breathed in the effluent. Mythology has morphed\ninto ecology. We\u2019re witnessing a slow-motion Ragnarok\u2014a story from Norse\nmythology in which a great battle burns the world. Climate history is becoming\na subnarrative of fire history.\n\nKevin Cooley\n\nIn the 21st century experts in lots of disciplines have proposed ways to cope\nwith fire challenges. Let me close by proposing three responses\u2014a fire\ntriangle for the Pyrocene.\n\nThe first side of the triangle: We have too much bad fire. We have too many\nfires that kill people, destroy communities and trash valued landscapes. In\ntrying to abolish fire, we killed off many of the good fires that make bad\nones easier to fight.\n\nBut modernity has shaped communities that are particularly vulnerable to fire.\nThe problem of urban fire was solved a century ago. Watching towns burn today\nis like watching the return of polio or smallpox. Partly, the issue is a\nmatter of definition. We defined the wildland-urban fire from the wildland\nside, viewing it as wildland fire complicated by houses. We should have\ndefined the problem as urban fire complicated by peculiar landscaping. Define\nthe problem as wildland fire, and it\u2019s nearly unsolvable. Define it as urban,\nand we know exactly what protective measures need to be taken.\n\nThe second side: We have too little good fire. Restoring fire is tricky. As is\ntrue of reintroducing any lost species, it\u2019s much easier to take fire out than\nto put it back in. We need to recover a lot of traditional knowledge while\nadapting it for current conditions. We can send people with drip torches along\nold trails, burn cropland set-asides as fallow, and create hybrid management\nschemes that alloy suppression and prescribed burning of single fires,\nespecially those in nature preserves and in the backcountry.\n\nNote, however, that replacing fossil fuels with renewables as a primary energy\nsource will not be enough. If we use renewables to sustain the same landscapes\nwe have now, we will have the same fire problems, though perhaps tamped down\nby lessened global warming. The U.S. still has a major fire deficit. As we\nratchet down our burning of lithic landscapes, we\u2019ll have to ratchet up our\nburning of living landscapes. We have a lot of fire in our future.\n\nThe third side: We have way too much combustion overall. We must shut down the\nburning of fossil fuels. We can mitigate its effects only so much.\n\nHere let me leave the U.S. for Victoria, Australia, and the saga of the\nHazelwood power station. Hazelwood was erected to burn brown coal from an\nadjacent open-pit mine. In 2009 power lines in the area kindled fires in the\nBlack Saturday bushfire outbreak. A few years later bushfires ignited the\nopen-pit mine. The two realms of fire were turning on each other. It\u2019s common\nfor open-pit mines to consume the communities around them; in this case, the\nbush consumed the mine. What parable will we extract from this saga?\n\nAs we approach our fire-informed future, I\u2019m reminded of the Old Testament\nprophet Ezekiel, who declaimed, \u201cThey shall go out from one fire, and another\nfire shall devour them.\u201d We hold a species monopoly over fire. It\u2019s what we do\nthat no other creature does; it\u2019s our role in the great chain of being. For\nus, fire is not just an ecological process or a tool; it\u2019s a relationship.\nThrough greed and a lust for power, we have turned our ancient companion from\nour best friend into our worst enemy.\n\nGood fire made us. Bad fire may break us. The choice is ours.\n\n### From Our Archives\n\nSpontaneous Combustion and Fires. The Editors; March 20, 1858. The Ecology of\nFire. Charles F. Cooper; April 1961.
