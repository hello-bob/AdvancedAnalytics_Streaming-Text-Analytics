But quickly\nthe documentary became a source of controversy, as fans started noticing\nglaring flaws in images used in the movie, from weirdly mismatched earrings to\nher nose appearing to lack nostrils, the Daily Mail reported, in a post\nshowing a plethora of examples of images from the film.\n\nFuturism was among the first to point out that these flawed images (around the\n28-minute mark of the documentary) \"have all the hallmarks of an AI-generated\nphoto, down to mangled hands and fingers, misshapen facial features, morphed\nobjects in the background, and a far-too-long front tooth.\" The image with the\nlong front tooth was even used in Netflix's poster for the movie.\n\nBecause the movie's credits do not mention any uses of AI, critics called out\nthe documentary filmmakers for potentially embellishing a movie that's\nsupposed to be based on real-life events.\n\nBut Jeremy Grimaldi\u2014who is also the crime reporter who wrote a book on the\ncase and provided the documentary with research and police footage\u2014told the\nToronto Star that the images were not AI-generated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrimaldi confirmed that all images of Pan used in the movie were real photos.\nHe said that some of the images were edited, though, not to blur the lines\nbetween truth and fiction, but to protect the identity of the source of the\nimages.\n\n\u201cAny filmmaker will use different tools, like Photoshop, in films,\u201d Grimaldi\ntold The Star. \u201cThe photos of Jennifer are real photos of her. The foreground\nis exactly her. The background has been anonymized to protect the source.\u201d\n\nWhile Grimaldi's comments provide some assurance that the photos are edited\nversions of real photos of Pan, they are also vague enough to obscure whether\nAI was among the \"different tools\" used to edit the photos.\n\nOne photographer, Joe Foley, wrote in a post for Creative Bloq that he thought\n\"documentary makers may have attempted to enhance old low-resolution images\nusing AI-powered upscaling or photo restoration software to try to make them\nlook clearer on a TV screen.\"\n\n\"The problem is that even the best AI software can only take a poor-quality\nimage so far, and such programs tend to over sharpen certain lines, resulting\nin strange artifacts,\" Foley said.\n\nFoley suggested that Netflix should have \"at the very least\" clarified that\nimages had been altered \"to avoid this kind of backlash,\" noting that \"any\nkind of manipulation of photos in a documentary is controversial because the\nwhole point is to present things as they were.\"\n\nHollywood's increasing use of AI has indeed been controversial, with\nscreenwriters' unions opposing AI tools as \"plagiarism machines\" and artists\nstirring recent backlash over the \"experimental\" use of AI art in a horror\nfilm. Even using AI for a movie poster, as Civil War did, is enough to\ngenerate controversy, the Hollywood Reporter reported.\n\nNeither Raw TV, the production company behind What Jennifer Did, nor Netflix\nresponded to Ars' request for comment.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Scientists Respond to Science Deniers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n60\n\nAshley Belanger Ashley is a senior policy reporter for Ars Technica, dedicated\nto tracking social impacts of emerging policies and new technologies.
