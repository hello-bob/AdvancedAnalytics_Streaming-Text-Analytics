Graph as\n> representation for knowledge has several drawbacks like data sparsity,\n> computational complexity and manual feature engineering. Knowledge Graph\n> embedding tackles the drawback by representing entities and relation in low\n> dimensional vector space by capturing the semantic relation between them.\n> There are different KG embedding models. Here, we discuss translation based\n> and neural network based embedding models which differ based on semantic\n> property, scoring function and architecture they use. Further, we discuss\n> application of KG in some domains that use deep learning models and leverage\n> social media data.\n\nSubjects:| Social and Information Networks (cs.SI); Artificial Intelligence\n(cs.AI)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.09167 [cs.SI]  \n(or arXiv:2404.09167v1 [cs.SI] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.09167arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Manita Pote [view email] [v1] Sun, 14 Apr 2024 07:15:59 UTC (435 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Survey on Embedding Models for Knowledge Graph\nand its Applications, by Manita Pote\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.SI\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
