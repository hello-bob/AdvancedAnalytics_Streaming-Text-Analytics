This\ntransfer requires quantum resources, such as entanglement between an\nadditional pair of qubits. In an ideal case, the transfer and teleportation of\nthe qubit state can be done perfectly. However, real-world systems are\nvulnerable to noise and disturbances \u2014 and this reduces and limits the quality\nof the teleportation.\n\nResearchers from the University of Turku, Finland, and the University of\nScience and Technology of China, Hefei, have now proposed a theoretical idea\nand made corresponding experiments to overcome this problem. In other words,\nthe new approach enables reaching high-quality teleportation despite the\npresence of noise.\n\n\u201cThe work is based on an idea of distributing entanglement \u2014 prior to running\nthe teleportation protocol \u2014 beyond the used qubits, i.e., exploiting the\nhybrid entanglement between different physical degrees of freedom\u201d, says\nProfessor Jyrki Piilo from the University of Turku.\n\nConventionally, the polarisation of photons has been used for the entanglement\nof qubits in teleportation, while the current approach exploits the hybrid\nentanglement between the photons\u2019 polarisation and frequency.\n\n\u201cThis allows for a significant change in how the noise influences the\nprotocol, and as a matter of fact our discovery reverses the role of the noise\nfrom being harmful to being beneficial to teleportation\u201d, Piilo describes.\n\nWith conventional qubit entanglement in the presence of noise, the\nteleportation protocol does not work. In a case where there is initially\nhybrid entanglement and no noise, the teleportation does not work either.\n\n\u201cHowever, when we have hybrid entanglement and add noise, the teleportation\nand quantum state transfer occur in almost perfect manner\u201d, says Dr Olli\nSiltanen whose doctoral dissertation presented the theoretical part of the\ncurrent research.\n\nIn general, the discovery enables almost ideal teleportation despite the\npresence of certain type of noise when using photons for teleportation.\n\n\u201cWhile we have done numerous experiments on different facets of quantum\nphysics with photons in our laboratory, it was very thrilling and rewarding to\nsee this very challenging teleportation experiment successfully completed\u201d,\nsays Dr Zhao-Di Liu from the University of Science and Technology of China,\nHefei.\n\n\u201cThis is a significant proof-of-principle experiment in the context of one of\nthe most important quantum protocols\u201d, says Professor Chuan-Feng Li from the\nUniversity of Science and Technology of China, Hefei.\n\nTeleportation has important applications, e.g., in transmitting quantum\ninformation, and it is of utmost importance to have approaches that protect\nthis transmission from noise and can be used for other quantum applications.\nThe results of the current study can be considered as basic research that\ncarries significant fundamental importance and opens intriguing pathways for\nfuture work to extend the approach to general types of noise sources and other\nquantum protocols.\n\nThe results have been published in the journal Science Advances.\n\nLink to the article\n\n### More information:\n\nJyrki Piilo, +358 50 350 3996, jyrki.piilo@utu.fi\n\nImage: Mikael Nyberg, University of Turku\n\n####\n\n## Science newsletter\n\nSubscribe to our science newsletter\n\n####\n\n## Support science and research\n\nMake a donation to the University of Turku\n\nCreated 02.05.2024 | Updated 03.05.2024\n\n##### Keywords\n\nteleportation\n\nQuantum physics\n\nquantum technology\n\nentanglement\n\nPhysics\n\nFuture technologies and digital society\n\nLaboratory of Quantum Optics\n\n### You might also be interested in\n\n06.06.2023\n\n### First Detection of Secondary Supermassive Black Hole in a Well-Known\nBinary System\n\nPress release\n\n17.05.2023\n\n### Radio signal reveals supernova origin\n\nPress release\n\n16.02.2023\n\n### Astrophysicists discover a puzzlingly perfect spherical explosion in space\n\nPress release\n\n21.07.2022\n\n### Astronomers from the University of Turku to scan the sky in search of\noptical signals from gravitational waves\n\nPress release\n\n  * All news\n  * All events\n\nUniversity of Turku\n\nFI-20014 Turun yliopisto, Finland\n\nPhone number: +358 29 450 5000\n\n> People Search\n\n> Contact Information & Invoicing Address\n\n> Campus Map\n\n> HR Excellence in Research\n\n> Privacy Notice\n\n> Description of Document Publicity & Information Requests\n\n> Whistleblowing\n\n> Accessibility Statement\n\n> Feedback\n\n> Intranet & Online Tools\n\n> Cookie Settings\n\nUniversity of Turku on Facebook\n\nUniversity of Turku on Instagram\n\nUniversity of Turku on Twitter\n\nUniversity of Turku on Youtube\n\nUniversity of Turku on Linkedin\n\nUniversity of Turku on Tiktok\n\nScroll to topTop\n\n\u2713\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\nAddToAny\n\nMore...\n\n", "frontpage": false}
