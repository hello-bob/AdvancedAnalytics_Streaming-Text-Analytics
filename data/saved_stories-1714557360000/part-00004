The\nluminosity is reported to be visible for several seconds, but has also been\nreported to last for tens of minutes. Accounts of viewable distance from the\nepicenter varies: in the 1930 Idu earthquake, lights were reported up to 110\nkm (70 mi) from the epicenter.^[7] Earthquake lights were reportedly spotted\nin Tianshui, Gansu, approximately 400 km (250 mi) north-northeast of the 2008\nSichuan earthquake's epicenter.^[8]\n\nDuring the 2003 Colima earthquake in Mexico, colorful lights were seen in the\nskies for the duration of the earthquake.^[citation needed] During the 2007\nPeru earthquake lights were seen in the skies above the sea and filmed by many\npeople.^[9] The phenomenon was also observed and caught on film during the\n2009 L'Aquila^[10]^[11] and the 2010 Chile earthquakes.^[12] The phenomenon\nwas also reported around the North Canterbury earthquake in New Zealand, that\noccurred 1 September 1888. The lights were visible in the morning of 1\nSeptember in Reefton, and again on 8 September.^[13]\n\nMore recent appearances of the phenomenon, along with video footage of the\nincidents, happened in Sonoma County, California on August 24, 2014,^[14] and\nin Wellington, New Zealand on November 14, 2016, where blue flashes like\nlightning were seen in the night sky, and recorded on several videos.^[15] On\nSeptember 8, 2017, many people reported such sightings in Mexico City after a\n8.2 magnitude earthquake with epicenter 740 km (460 mi) away, near Pijijiapan\nin the state of Chiapas.^[16]\n\nAppearances of the earthquake light seem to occur when the quakes have a high\nmagnitude, generally 5 or higher on the Richter scale.^[14] There have also\nbeen incidents of yellow, ball-shaped lights appearing before\nearthquakes.^[17]\n\nInstances of this phenomenon appear in videos^[18] taken seconds after a 7.1\nmagnitude earthquake in the city of Acapulco, Mexico, around 20:47 on 7\nSeptember 2021. The New York Times reported that \"Videos from both Acapulco\nand Mexico City also showed the night sky lit up with electrical flashes as\npower lines swayed and buckled.\"^[19]\n\nA recent one was seen in Qinghai Province, China at 01:45 on 8 January 2022.\nSurveillance video of a local resident captured the moment. During the 2022\nFukushima earthquake the phenomena was captured on video from multiple\nangles.^[20] A 2023 study found the earthquake light coincided with a magnetic\ndisturbance detected by a geomagnetic observatory, and ruled out \"the\npossibility of the flashes being caused by explosions in transformers or power\nsupply facilities\" by checking the maintenance reports of regional power\nstations, none of which had malfunctioned near the location of the observed\nlight.^[21]\n\nThis phenomenon was observed around 1:18 on 22 September 2022 when a magnitude\n6.8 aftershock of the 2022 Michoac\u00e1n earthquake struck. Social media users\nincluding Webcams de M\u00e9xico posted videos of blue lights which seemed to be\nradiating upward. This was reported in Mexico News Daily and included one of\nthe videos.^[22]\n\nDuring the 2023 Turkey\u2013Syria earthquake, multiple lights appeared continuously\nin Kahramanmara\u015f and Hatay provinces.^[23] Later that year, blue light flashes\nwere also seen in Agadir during the Marrakesh-Safi earthquake.^[24]\n\n## Types[edit]\n\nSimplified model of phole propagation within an interplate, orogenic tectonic\nsetting in a subduction zone environment (i.e., Andean\u2010type). The vertical\nscale (topographic relief) is exaggerated for clarity. +, positive holes; e\u2032,\nelectrons.^[25]\n\nEarthquake lights may be classified into two different groups based on their\ntime of appearance: (1) preseismic earthquake light, which generally occur a\nfew seconds to up to a few weeks prior to an earthquake, and are generally\nobserved closer to the epicenter and (2) coseismic earthquake light, which can\noccur either near the epicenter (\"earthquake\u2010induced stress\"), or at\nsignificant distances away from the epicenter during the passage of the\nseismic wavetrain, in particular during the passage of S waves (\"wave\u2010induced\nstress\").^[25]\n\nEarthquake light during the lower magnitude aftershock series seem to be\nrare.^[25]\n\n## Possible explanations[edit]\n\nResearch into earthquake lights is ongoing; as such, several mechanisms have\nbeen proposed.\n\nSome models suggest the generation of earthquake lights involve the ionization\nof oxygen to oxygen anions by breaking of peroxy bonds in some types of rocks\n(dolomite, rhyolite, etc.) by the high stress before and during an\nearthquake.^[25] After the ionisation, the ions travel up through the cracks\nin the rocks. Once they reach the atmosphere these ions can ionise pockets of\nair, forming plasma that emits light.^[26] Lab experiments have validated that\nsome rocks do ionise the oxygen in them when subjected to high stress levels.\nResearch suggests that the angle of the fault is related to the likelihood of\nearthquake light generation, with subvertical (nearly vertical) faults in\nrifting environments having the most incidences of earthquake lights.^[27]\n\nOne hypothesis involves intense electric fields created piezoelectrically by\ntectonic movements of quartz-containing rocks such as granite.^[28]\n\nAnother possible explanation is local disruption of the Earth's magnetic field\nand/or ionosphere in the region of tectonic stress, resulting in the observed\nglow effects either from ionospheric radiative recombination at lower\naltitudes and greater atmospheric pressure or as aurora. However, the effect\nis clearly not pronounced or notably observed at all earthquake events and is\nyet to be directly experimentally verified.^[29]\n\nDuring the American Physical Society's 2014 March meeting, research was\nprovided that gave a possible explanation for the reason why bright lights\nsometimes appear during an earthquake. The research stated that when two\nlayers of the same material rub against each other, voltage is generated. The\nresearcher, Troy Shinbrot of Rutgers University, conducted experiments with\ndifferent types of grains to mimic the crust of the Earth and emulated the\noccurrence of earthquakes. He reported that \"when the grains split open, they\nmeasured a positive voltage spike, and when the split closed, a negative\nspike.\" The crack allows the voltage to discharge into the air which then\nelectrifies the air and creates a bright electrical light when it does so.\nAccording to Shinbrot, they have produced these voltage spikes every single\ntime with every material tested. While the reason for such an occurrence was\nnot provided, Shinbrot referenced the phenomenon of triboluminescence.\nResearchers hope that by getting to the bottom of this phenomenon, it will\nprovide more information that will allow seismologists to better predict\nearthquakes.^[30]^[31]^[32]\n\n## Skepticism[edit]\n\nIn 2016, podcaster Brian Dunning said he was skeptical that the phenomenon\neven existed, citing a lack of direct evidence. There is also a \"staggering\nvolume of literature... hardly any of these papers agree on anything... I'm\nforced to wonder how many of these eager researchers are familiar with Hyman's\nCategorical Imperative 'Do not try to explain something until you are sure\nthere is something to be explained'.\"^[33]\n\nIn 2016, freelance writer Robert Sheaffer wrote that skeptics and science\nbloggers should be more skeptical of the phenomenon. Sheaffer on his Bad UFO\nblog shows examples of what people claim are earthquake lights, then he shows\nphotos of iridescent clouds which appear to be the same. He states that \"It's\ntruly remarkable how mutable \"earthquake lights\" are. Sometimes they look like\nsmall globes, climbing up a mountain. Sometimes they look like flashes of\nlightning. Other times they look exactly like iridescent clouds. Earthquake\nlights can look like anything at all, when you are avidly seeking evidence for\nthem.\"^[34]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Ball lightning\n  * Earthquake cloud\n  * Earthquake prediction\n  * Earthquake weather\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Whitehead, Neil Evan; Ulusoy, \u00dc.
