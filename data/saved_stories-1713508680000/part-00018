This paper reviews the advancements and\n> applications of these models in weather prediction, emphasizing their role\n> in transforming traditional forecasting methods. Models like FourCastNet,\n> Pangu-Weather, GraphCast, ClimaX, and FengWu have made notable contributions\n> by providing accurate, high-resolution forecasts, surpassing the\n> capabilities of traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models. These\n> models utilize advanced neural network architectures, such as Convolutional\n> Neural Networks (CNNs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Transformers, to\n> process diverse meteorological data, enhancing predictive accuracy across\n> various time scales and spatial resolutions. The paper addresses challenges\n> in this domain, including data acquisition and computational demands, and\n> explores future opportunities for model optimization and hardware\n> advancements. It underscores the integration of artificial intelligence with\n> conventional meteorological techniques, promising improved weather\n> prediction accuracy and a significant contribution to addressing climate-\n> related challenges. This synergy positions large models as pivotal in the\n> evolving landscape of meteorological forecasting.\n\nComments:| 5 pages  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI);\nAtmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.06668 [cs.LG]  \n(or arXiv:2404.06668v1 [cs.LG] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.06668arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Hailong Shu [view email] [v1] Wed, 10 Apr 2024 00:52:54 UTC (342 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Forecasting the Future with Future\nTechnologies: Advancements in Large Meteorological Models, by Hailong Shu and\n4 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.LG\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2024-04\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI physics physics.ao-ph\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\nIArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
