(AP Photo/Darko Vojinovic)\n\nMay 2, 2024\n\nBy\n\nKatherine Kelaidis\n\n(RNS) \u2014 Before culture war issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage,\nvaccines or pronouns, there was the battle over calendar reform, a battle that\nshows signs of ending.\n\nThere is once again renewed hope that ongoing ecumenical dialogue between the\nGreek Orthodox Patriarchate of Constantinople and the Roman Catholic Church\nwill resolve an ancient rift between the two halves of Christianity over when\nEaster is celebrated. Depending on a decision by the Ecumenical Patriarchate\nof Constantinople, Bartholomew I, (with, one must imagine, the support of the\nPatriarchate of Alexandria and the Church of Greece) to adopt the Western\nGregorian calendar, Sunday (May 5) might be the last time that some Eastern\nChristians celebrate Easter on a different date than Westerners.\n\nIf such a decision is made, it will be one of the most significant moves in\nhealing the nearly 1,000-year-old rift between the two ancient churches, and\nit will move the \u201cGreek churches\u201d further away from their Slavic Orthodox\nChristian brothers and closer to Rome. It will also most likely further the\ndeep, growing divide between the Patriarchate of Constantinople and the\nPatriarchate of Moscow.\n\nSkip\n\nAds by\n\nEither way, it will be yet another turning point in the centuries-old battle\nover \u201cthe calendar,\u201d and the decision will not be merely practical or\ntheological but will be the next chapter in the longest-running culture war in\nthe West.\n\nRELATED: Asteroid named after pope behind Gregorian calendar reform\n\nThat war began in the early Middle Ages, by which time scholars were aware\nthat the Julian calendar, the calendar that Christendom had inherited from the\nRoman Empire, had some problems. Adding a day every 128 years, the Julian\ncalendar didn\u2019t keep Easter, the important Christian feast that is calculated\naccording to the spring equinox, from slipping down the calendar year, out of\nsync with the seasons.\n\nThe ordering of time became a fight about the ecclesiastical implications of\nscientific discovery and societal change, the role of geopolitics in shaping\nreligious identity and the shifting borders of tradition and innovation. It\u2019s\nwhy, over the centuries, figures no less famous than the Venerable Bede and\nDante weighed in: Time is a theological problem as much as a scientific one.\n\nIn 1326, the Byzantine astronomer and theologian Nicephorus Gregoras proposed\na reform that would remedy the problem, but Andronikos II Palaiologos, the\nembattled Byzantine emperor, rejected the proposal. The Schism of 1054, \u201cthe\nGreat Schism,\u201d had already split Roman Christianity from Byzantine\nChristianity. Then, less than 100 years before Nicephorus put his reforms\nforward, Western crusaders had sacked Constantinople. If one part of the\ndivided Christendom accepted changes to the calendar and another part did not,\nAndronikos feared, repair would be impossible.\n\nOver the next two centuries, repair eluded the churches anyway. Constantinople\nfell to the Ottomans, an attempted reunion of the two churches at the Council\nof Florence had failed, and a pesky German friar name Martin Luther had\nlaunched the Protestant Reformation, dividing Christianity into many more\nparts than two.\n\nBy the time Pope Gregory XIII decreed changes to the calendar in 1582, in a\npapal bull titled \u201cAmong the Most Serious Matters,\u201d plenty of people had long\nsince stopped taking orders from the bishop of Rome. While Catholic countries\nadopted the Gregorian calendar, and even Elizabeth I\u2019s privy council initially\nlooked favorably on its changes, her Anglican bishops, like many Protestant\nleaders, saw the reform as an attempt to restore papal authority over them.\nOnly in the 18th century, as Europe\u2019s religious wars began to subside, did\nProtestant countries make the change.\n\nSkip\n\nAds by\n\nIn the Orthodox world, the situation was even more complicated. As the\ncenturies wore on, a stubborn adherence to tradition and a belief in an\n\u201cunchanging church\u201d became hallmarks of an identity that was increasingly\ndominated by a sense of siege by Western Christians and Islam. The Julian\ncalendar was not just the calendar, but part of the unbroken legacy of the\nancient world from which Orthodoxy claimed its legitimacy.\n\nBut in the early 20th century, as the Ottoman Empire collapsed and Imperial\nRussia gave way to communist revolution, many civil governments in emerging\nmajority-Orthodox states adopted the Gregorian calendar, while the\necclesiastical authorities refused to yield.\n\nThe first crack in the church\u2019s united front came in May 1923, when the\nCouncil of Constantinople, convened by Greek Orthodox Patriarch Meletius\nMetaxakis, adopted the Revised Julian calendar, a compromise devised by a\nSerbian scientist who said it was more accurate than either the original\nJulian or the Gregorian calendars. Its primary benefit, however, was that it\nlined up with the Gregorian calendar until February of 2800, all without any\nof the complications of seeming to obey the pope.\n\nMany Orthodox churches, including the Russian Orthodox Church, rejected the\nmove. Worse, in churches that made the change to the revised calendar,\nconservative or anti-Western factions broke away from the Mother Church of\nConstantinople over what they saw as a grave heresy. A compromise was\neventually struck, stipulating that the date of Easter would continue to be\nset according to the \u201cOld Calendar\u201d for all Orthodox Christians, regardless of\nwhich calendar they used for other purposes.\n\nRELATED: Ukrainian Orthodox churches purge vestiges of Russian influence\n\nThis remains the status of Easter today everywhere in the Orthodox world,\nexcept for the Orthodox Church of Finland, which has adopted the Gregorian\nEaster. Any shift away from this uneasy settlement will likely be seen a move\ntoward Western modernity.\n\nVirtually absent from the conversation are the practical concerns of having a\ncalendar that accurately describes observable astronomical facts. Of course,\nthis is true of most culture war issues, which by definition require us to\nabandon reason in favor of taking a a position on who we are and who we are\nnot. If a battle over calendars strikes us absurd, we might have something to\nlearn from this unfinished business.\n\n(Katherine Kelaidis, a research associate at the Institute of Orthodox\nChristian Studies in Cambridge, England, is the author of \u201cHoly Russia?
