I really enjoy a mix of working on various\nprojects, writing about aspects of those projects that might be of interest to\nothers, and exploring many aspects of Python itself in depth.\n\nAs much as I\u2019ve enjoyed writing about Python and other technical topics, I\u2019ve\ngrown quite dissatisfied with Substack as a hosting platform. Starting next\nweek, I\u2019ll be using Ghost as a hosting service. The content of this newsletter\nwon\u2019t be changing, but the look and feel will be a little different.\n\nIn this post I\u2019ll share some of the reasoning behind this change. I\u2019ll also\nshare some thoughts about how this relates to the choices programmers have to\nmake about the platforms and services we rely on for many real-world projects.\n\n### What\u2019s wrong with Substack?\n\nI started using Substack because I was looking for a simple newsletter\nplatform that would let me focus on writing. That\u2019s what Substack was in its\noriginal form, but now they seem to be focusing on growth for growth\u2019s sake.\nThey also seem to be evolving into a social media platform that thrives on the\nkind of conflicts and divisiveness that has driven people away from other\nplatforms.1\n\nI just want to write a good technical newsletter, and Substack is no longer\nthe most appropriate platform on which to do that.\n\n### Why Ghost?\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of it, Ghost is a platform similar to what Substack was\nwhen it started. Just like with Substack, you can write a newsletter that\nbecomes an online archive. You can write posts that go out over email, and\nothers that are only available online. Ghost has been around for over ten\nyears, and hasn\u2019t tried to implement the kinds of social features that\nSubstack has.\n\nOne of the strongest reasons to move to Ghost is that it\u2019s built on top of\nopen source software. The names are a bit confusing; there are several things\npeople mean when they say \u201cGhost\u201d:\n\n  * The open source project Ghost, which is a framework for \u201cmodern publishing\u201d. It supports blogging, newsletters, and managing free and paid content. Because the core framework is open source, you can either self-host your publication or use a managed service.\n  * The managed hosting service Ghost Pro.\n  * The non-profit organization Ghost, which operates the Ghost Pro managed service. Revenue from operating the managed service supports ongoing development of the open source framework.\n\nI\u2019m going to use the managed version, because I want to focus on writing\nwithout having to do a bunch of sysadmin work. Because of its basis in open\nsource, I feel much more confident that Ghost will be a long-term home for\nMostly Python than I ever felt with Substack.\n\nGhost is an actively maintained open source project. I\u2019m going to use a\nmanaged hosting service for now, but it\u2019s nice to know that self-hosting is an\noption if I ever need to got that route.\n\nAt this point it\u2019s hard to choose a closed platform if an equivalent platform\nis available that\u2019s built on open source. I\u2019ve watched so many closed\nplatforms and services take one or more of the following paths:\n\n  * Introduce ads in an effort to monetize user-generated content;\n  * Adopt dark patterns that pull users into higher usage levels than they originally intended;\n  * Add features that aren\u2019t aligned with the original purpose of the platform or service, and slowly push people into using those features;\n  * Close off features and services that were central to the original platform\u2019s appeal.\n\nIf Ghost Pro happens to fall into any of these patterns, there are two\npossibilities other than just moving to an entirely different platform. Since\nGhost itself is open source, anyone can build a competing hosting service that\nleaves out the problematic features. Migrating between platforms that use the\nsame underlying framework is much easier than migrating between different\nproprietary platforms. If a reasonable managed service doesn\u2019t appear, I can\nalways choose to self-host the service. I don\u2019t particularly want to do that,\nbut I may choose that option over migrating yet again Again, I don\u2019t think\nI\u2019ll need to move off of Ghost because it\u2019s not susceptible to the same kinds\nof pressures that Substack is.2\n\n### The bigger picture\n\nMost people reading this post probably aren\u2019t planning to start a newsletter\nanytime soon. But many people are making decisions on a regular basis about\nwhich services to pay for, and which service providers to trust. When you\u2019re\nworking through these kinds of decisions, consider each of the following\nquestions:\n\n#### Can you export your critical data?\n\nI knew Substack might not be a long term fit, but I was willing to give it a\ntry because they allow you to export all your critical data. Writers \u201cown\u201d\ntheir content and subscriber list, and can export those at any time. Platforms\nthat support exporting, and allow you to retain full ownership of your data,\nmake it easy to implement effective backup routines and give you a way out of\nvendor lock-in.\n\nMake sure you run an export early on, and look at exactly what\u2019s in that\nexport. While \u201cyou own your data and you can leave at any time\u201d sounds nice,\nit\u2019s probably a lot of work to process that data in a way that it can be used\non another platform. Also, platforms don\u2019t always keep their export services\nfully up to date. You might rely on a platform\u2019s export function, and then\nwhen it comes time to use that data (for backup or migration purposes), find\nthat some critical elements were never included in the export.\n\n#### What\u2019s the platform\u2019s business model?\n\nEvery platform and service costs money to run. If the platform is charging\nenough for its core services, it\u2019s more likely that they\u2019ll be able to\ncontinue offering those services without trying to push unwanted \u201cfeatures\u201d on\nthe user base.3\n\n#### How have they funded operations so far?\n\nUnderstanding a platform\u2019s funding history can give you a sense of how\nreliable their service is likely to be. For example, Substack has raised on\nthe order of $100 million in venture capital. Now they need to generate enough\nrevenue to pay that original investment back, while covering current operating\nexpenses, and making a profit on top of that. If they can\u2019t do that, they\u2019ll\nneed to seek even more funding, get acquired by a larger company, or fold.\nSometimes a company will drift from its original mission in pursuit of a\nbusiness model that\u2019s profitable enough to pay off their earlier investment\nrounds.\n\nThe fact that a company has sought venture funding is not a bad thing in and\nof itself. It\u2019s one way that promising companies can grow quickly, while\nthey\u2019re still establishing sustainable revenue streams. If funding levels\nalign with a valid business model, the company may become sustainable. If a\ncompany has grown rapidly without a clearly sustainable business model\nhowever, that company\u2019s platform can be much less reliable in the long term.\n\nIf you\u2019ll only need a company\u2019s services for a short time, none of this\nmatters too much. But if you\u2019re planning to rely on a service over a period of\nyears, considering these kinds of details can help you make an informed\ndecision about which platforms to trust.\n\n#### What\u2019s the public perception of the company?\n\nIn some areas, public perception doesn\u2019t mean a whole lot. Nobody really likes\nOracle, but that company is probably going to be around for a long time.\nPeople have serious frustrations with Adobe\u2019s subscription plans, but their\nservices are pretty reliable if you choose to use them.\n\nA platform that requires a large user base, who could leave at any time, is a\nmuch different story. Platforms collapse and get acquired on a regular basis.\nSometimes that plays out as a company closing suddenly, and sometimes the\ncompany does things over time that drive more and more users away. If the\nplatform you\u2019re choosing is susceptible to these dynamics, look at some of the\npublic statements its leaders are making. Try to get a sense of whether they\nmight be creating problems for themselves in the near to mid term future, or\nif they inspire confidence in their leadership and decision-making abilities.\n\nEvery time Substack has experienced conflict around their policies, they\u2019ve\ndoubled down on the policies that led to those conflicts in the first place.\nI\u2019ve spent a good part of my life dealing with conflict, and I\u2019m happy to\naddress it when necessary. But when a company or platform fosters conflict\nbecause it increases engagement, I want no part of that.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nI\u2019ve really enjoyed writing Mostly Python over the past year, and look forward\nto many years of continuing to do so. Next Thursday\u2019s post will have the same\nkind of content you\u2019re used to seeing here; it will just look a little\ndifferent.\n\nI\u2019ll send one last email out from Substack after publishing from Ghost for the\nfirst time. That email will include a way to reach out if something goes wrong\nin the transition. If you\u2019re a paid subscriber, Substack and Ghost both use\nStripe for billing, so your subscription should carry over smoothly.\n\nThank you for joining me here on Substack, and I hope you\u2019ll stay with me\nthrough this transition as well.\n\n  1. What started as a simple newsletter delivery platform is turning into a haphazardly built social media site. Last year Substack introduced Notes, its Twitter clone. They said they were building Notes without moderation, because they trust users to moderate themselves. Last fall Substack was called out quite publicly for allowing literal Nazi content on their platform. When they finally responded to an open letter from Substack writers, they basically said they don\u2019t like Nazis but believe that any level of moderation equates to censorship. This free-speech absolutism is disingenuous; every public communication platform has to deal with moderation. If you\u2019re interested in more specific thoughts on all of this, I wrote a more detailed overview of Substack\u2019s issues previously.\n\nSubstack continues to build \u201cfeatures\u201d that are aimed at simply inflating\neveryone\u2019s subscriber numbers and connectedness on the platform. They\u2019re\nstarting to adopt dark patterns that lead people to subscribe to more\nnewsletters than they intend to, and follow more people on Notes than they\nintended to as well. If you\u2019ve been around the internet for a while, you\u2019ve\nseen this play out before. What starts as a clean platform develops into one\nwith more and more calls to \u201cengage\u201d and less of a focus on actual content. \u21a9\n\n  2. If you happen to be considering self-hosting Ghost for one of your projects, Molly White wrote a fantastically detailed post about her initial setup. \u21a9\n\n  3. Substack\u2019s main revenue source is that it keeps 10% of all revenue from paid subscriptions. That means they\u2019re under constant pressure to increase the number of paid subscriptions, and the amount that people are paying for those subscriptions. Ghost, and most other newsletter platforms, charge volume-based usage fees. That means those platforms can let individual writers choose how and when to prompt readers to consider a paid subscription.\n\nIt\u2019s much easier to avoid the temptation to implement dark patterns if you\nhave a sustainable business model in the first place. \u21a9\n\n## Read more\n\n### Django from first principles, part 3\n\nMP 92: A better home page, using templates.
