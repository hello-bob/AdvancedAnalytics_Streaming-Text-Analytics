It refers to employees who are no longer willing to go the extra\nmile for an employer and it was widely considered a knock-on effect of the\npandemic.\n\nIn fact, quiet quitting is not new. Employees have always had the option to\nreduce their effort if they felt undervalued or overworked. What the pandemic\ndid was bring this resistance right out in the open as many resented the\nextent to which work had seeped into their personal lives during lockdown.\nOnce a semblance of normality returned, they started kicking back.\n\nWhat employers have found since is that quiet quitting is worse than the\ninconvenience of having an employee leave. Quiet quitters are hard to handle,\nboth on the job and in performance reviews, because they continue to complete\ntheir assigned workload to the same (often high) standard, giving their\nmanagers an uneasy feeling but nothing specific to complain about.\n\nQuiet quitting is subtle, unspoken and slippery to tie down, but a straw poll\nof managers suggests it is a lot more prevalent post-pandemic. \u201cYou always had\nthose who did their 9-5 but not a minute more and never chipped in if there\nwas a crisis. But it\u2019s become like a creeping malaise with a sort of passive-\naggressive undercurrent that\u2019s really exhausting,\u201d says one manager in charge\nof a large finance team in a busy multinational business.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n## Do you have work-related queries? From tricky bosses to hybrid working, ask\nthe experts\n\n## \u2018This is a land that is all about giving people a go\u2019\n\n## Staff at sanctions-hit Russian lessor awarded \u20ac31,738 by WRC\n\n\u201cTheir attitude also has an impact on colleagues who are affected by the\ndownbeat vibe and having to pick up the slack. Post-Covid, people are\ndefinitely less prepared to start early or work late and less willing to put\ntheir hand up if there\u2019s something extra to be done.\u201d\n\nAt one level it\u2019s reasonable to ask why should they? They are apparently\nfulfilling their employment obligations to the letter if not the spirit and if\nan organisation is constantly relying on employees to put in extra hours to\nmake the business model work, it is going to be in big trouble when that\ngoodwill runs out and it can hardly be surprised that it does.\n\nJob creep, where people end up doing tasks outside the original scope of their\nrole, is a fact of life. However, part of the problem now is that many\nemployers failed to \u201crecalibrate for more normal times\u201d when the pandemic was\nover, say organisational behaviour expert Prof Anthony C Klotz, from UCL\nSchool of Management in London and Mark C Bolino, professor of international\nbusiness at the University of Oklahoma\u2019s Price College of Business.\n\nWriting in the Harvard Business Review, the duo say that, \u201cafter more than two\nyears of pandemic-fuelled firefighting, during which more and more activities\nthat might once have been considered \u2018above and beyond\u2019 have become expected\nparts of workers\u2019 jobs, the benefits of citizenship behaviour may increasingly\nfeel outweighed by the costs\u201d.\n\n\u201cGoing above and beyond can come at a cost for employees,\u201d they add. \u201cIn a\nhealthy organisation, these costs are typically counterbalanced by benefits\nsuch as increased social capital, wellbeing and career success. The quiet\nquitting trend suggests that employees are increasingly feeling that this\nexchange has become unbalanced: employers are demanding additional effort from\nworkers without investing in them enough in return.\u201d\n\nKlotz and Bolino say that employers need to review employees\u2019 responsibilities\nand decide what is core and what is extra. They also suggest that the\nwithdrawal of effort may be linked to fatigue because employees don\u2019t feel\nsupported \u2013 something that could be tackled relatively easily by asking them\n(individually) what supports would help. Being flexible is important here as\npeople have different needs depending on age, responsibilities outside work\nand life stage.\n\n\u201cAs a manager in my 50s, I\u2019ve been around the block a few times and I have a\ncertain sympathy for the quiet quitters,\u201d the finance manager says. \u201cBut it\u2019s\nhard to deal with while keeping everyone else engaged. In particular it\u2019s a\nchallenge to ensure that the first job employees on the team don\u2019t assume this\nbehaviour is the norm.\n\n[ Big disconnect between employers and staff on hybrid work, report finds ]\n\n\u201cThe other thing that\u2019s becoming apparent is a level of thinly veiled anger\namong those in the 35 to 45+ age bracket. This is not about the job per se,\nalthough they go off like firecrackers if there\u2019s any suggestion that\nsomething like the hybrid working arrangements might change. It\u2019s more related\nto the pressures they\u2019re under outside work but it spills over and people are\ndefinitely more tetchy.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic tested everyone\u2019s resilience. People became really ill, they had\nto mourn family members in very difficult circumstances and some of my team\nare suffering from long Covid so the fallout is still being felt in the\nworkplace.\n\n[ Long Covid services are \u2018pot luck\u2019 for sufferers, TDs told ]\n\n\u201cBut whatever\u2019s going on for my crew, I still have my KPIs to meet so I can\nonly be understanding up to a point. I actively encourage my team to avail of\nour employee assistance programmes and I try to lead by example by doing a\nrelaxation class at lunchtime (provided on-site) or going outside to get some\nair if it\u2019s not lashing down.\n\n\u201cI also keep back some of my budget to spend on small rewards like sweet\ntreats when everyone is in the office, buying eggs at Easter or standing them\nthe occasional lunch. I\u2019m not naive enough to assume these gestures will sway\nthe quiet quitters, but for some of my team they make a difference and in the\nwords of the ad: every little helps.\u201d\n\n  * Sign up for Business push alerts and have the best news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone\n  * Find The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date\n  * Our Inside Business podcast is published weekly \u2013 Find the latest episode here\n\nWorkCovid-19Remote WorkingFor You\n\n##### IN THIS SECTION\n\n## Delays in work permits causing problems in Cork, say Indian nurses\n\n## \u2018This is a land that is all about giving people a go\u2019\n\n## Staff at sanctions-hit Russian lessor awarded \u20ac31,738 by WRC\n\n## Tara Mines: Voting begins on deal following meeting with \u2018a lot of anger\u2019\n\n## Quiet quitting: You always had workers who did 9-5 but it\u2019s a creeping\nmalaise, employers say\n\n##### MOST READ\n\n## Surrendered passport and \u20ac50,000 bail seem no hindrance to flight as top\ncocaine suspect vanishes\n\n## \u2018I could rent an apartment, but why?\u2019 The teenager who lives on Germany\u2019s\nhigh-speed trains\n\n## \u2018You averted your gaze walking past it\u2019: Belfast bar that was once a feared\nloyalist hangout is now the pride of the community\n\n## David McWilliams: A small town in Co Kerry and a formula for rejuvenating\nrural Ireland\n\n## \u2018I\u2019m alone pretty much all the time.
