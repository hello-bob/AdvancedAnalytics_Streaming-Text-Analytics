Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nA large and ancient volcano may be hiding in heavily fractured and eroded\nterrain on Mars, between the planet\u2019s largest canyons and its biggest\nvolcanoes, according to recent research. Tentatively named Noctis Mons, it\ncould have roared to life early in Martian history and continued to erupt as\nrecently as tens of millions of years ago.\n\nPascal Lee, a planetary scientist at the SETI Institute and the Mars Institute\nat NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center, and Sourabh Shubham, a graduate student at the\nUniversity of Maryland, discovered the possible volcano while studying a\nrelict glacier in Noctis Labyrinthus (Labyrinth of Night), a region just north\nof the equator.\n\nA digital elevation map of the region of Mars that includes Noctis Labyrinthus\nilluminates the hidden volcano.

The location\u2014between the giant\nTharsis volcanoes to the west and Valles Marineris, a canyon complex that\nwould stretch from San Francisco to Washington, D.C., to the east\u2014was also a\nclue.\n\n\u201cI think the evidence that this structure is a volcano is quite clear: The\ncentral caldera-like depression and gradual slopes leading up to it are pretty\ndefinitive,\u201d said Jeff Andrews-Hanna, a planetary scientist at the University\nof Arizona who was not involved in the research. \u201cIn retrospect, it\u2019s quite\namazing that this feature has been hiding in plain view for so long.\u201d\n\n### Blistered Terrain Suggests Volcanic Origin\n\nLee began studying Noctis Labyrinthus in detail when he proposed a mesa in the\nregion as a possible landing site for a human mission to Mars. \u201cFrom this\nlocation you could go east into the canyons, which might hold evidence of past\nlife, or west into the Tharsis plateau, which has caves and lava tubes where\nyou could look for modern life,\u201d Lee said. He and colleagues had previously\ndiscovered a relict (and possibly still existing) glacier at Noctis\nLabyrinthus, visible through collapsed areas in the overlying crust.\n\nAs Lee and Shubham studied images from several Mars-orbiting spacecraft, they\nfound that the glacial feature lies within a 5,000-square-kilometer field of\nvolcanic terrain, much of which is covered with \u201cblisters.\u201d The blisters look\nlike the \u201crootless cones\u201d found on Earth that form when volcanic material is\ndeposited atop water or ice, creating steam that blasts through the overlying\nmaterial.\n\nResearchers spotted what they believe is a deeply eroded volcano hidden among\nfractures. Credit: NASA/Annotation by Pascal Lee and Sourabh Shubham\n\nShubham studied surface deposits in the region, which include hydrated\nminerals, especially jarosite, a sulfur-rich mineral that can form when acidic\nvolcanic materials interact with water. He also found evidence of pyroxene,\nwhich can form when pyroclastic materials\u2014ash, pumice, and other explosive\ndebris\u2014react with glacial ice. The combination suggests recent volcanic\nactivity in the region. And the layer of volcanic debris could function as an\ninsulating blanket, potentially preserving glacial ice on geological\ntimescales, Lee said.\n\nThe researchers also used laser altimeter data to map surface elevations and\nfound a cone-shaped structure topping out at greater than 9,000 meters. The\nsurrounding terrain gently slopes away in every direction, with an outer\nperimeter up to 225 kilometers from the summit. Two circular features at the\ncenter of the structure could be remnant calderas.\n\n> \u201cWe don\u2019t see any alternative explanation.\u201d\n\nThe region has been heavily eroded, forming a jumble of canyons and mesas that\nmake it difficult to see the mountain\u2019s shape.\n\n\u201cAt this point, we\u2019re convinced that all the morphological features are\nconsistent with a volcano, and so is all the mineralogy evidence,\u201d Shubham\nsaid. \u201cWe don\u2019t see any alternative explanation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere could be some volcanic features there, but I\u2019m not sure if the whole\nthing is volcanic\u2014I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the right conclusion,\u201d said Patrick\nWhelley, a planetary geologist at the University of Maryland and Goddard Space\nFlight Center who was not involved in the study. \u201cBut in big-picture Martian\ngeology it would make sense to have a volcano there. It wouldn\u2019t be a huge\nparadigm shift.\u201d\n\n### Last Eruptions Could Have Been Recent\n\nNoctis Mons could have formed as a shield volcano during the Noachian period,\nperhaps 3.8 billion years ago, Lee said. Over the eons, the mountain would\nhave grown as it accumulated layers of lava, pyroclastic materials, and ice.\nUpwelling magma may have then elevated the region, creating fractures and\nfaults in the surface. Erupting lava might have destroyed large amounts of\nice, causing parts of Noctis Mons to collapse. Later glaciation would have\ncarved the present-day canyons.\n\nThe volcano could have been active in the relatively recent past, Lee\nsaid\u2014\u201cmaybe just tens of millions of years ago\u201d\u2014and it\u2019s possible that it\ncould be dormant today but not extinct. Impact crater counts should help\nrefine that estimate: Fewer craters would indicate a younger surface.\n\nNoctis Mons should make the proposed landing site even more appealing, Lee\nsaid. \u201cIt\u2019s a place with water and sustained heat, which are really important\nfor astrobiology \u2014 it\u2019s a place where we might want to look for signs of life,\npast or present,\u201d he said.\n\nThe discovery also raises the possibility that other major features remain\nhidden in plain sight on the Red Planet, Andrews-Hanna said. \u201cThis just goes\nto show that even after more than half a century of exploration, Mars still\nhas some surprises to offer us.\u201d\n\n\u2014Damond Benningfield, Science Writer\n\n##### Citation: Benningfield, D.
