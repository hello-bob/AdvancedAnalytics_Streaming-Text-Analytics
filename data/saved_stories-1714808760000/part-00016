She was awaiting a visa that\nwould bring her to the United States for a new job. With little else to do,\nshe visited her favorite hangouts in the town of Oxford, soaking up the sights\nand smells of the place she was about to leave. One day, she stopped in at the\nOED\u2019s archives in the basement of the Oxford University Press for a final look\naround.\n\nAlthough the dictionary was not founded at the university, the OED might be\ndescribed as the Oxford of dictionaries, so revered is it among reference\nworks and books in general. It is the gold standard of academic English-\nlanguage lexicography and a key tool behind many research projects into the\nhistory of English, including many other dictionaries. \u201cIt is as unthinkable\nthat any contemporary lexicographer be without the OED,\u201d wrote Sidney Landau\nin Dictionaries: The Art and Craft of Lexicography, first published in 1984,\n\u201cas it is that a professional photographer fail to own a tripod to support his\ncamera when needed.\u201d\n\nA New English Dictionary on Historical Principles, as it was originally\ncalled, expounded a new model for dictionaries\u2014the historical\ndictionary\u2014teaching readers, many for the first time, to think of linguistic\nform and meaning as historically mutable. Words change\u2014this is the OED\u2019s great\nlesson, taught one dictionary entry at a time. Such change is documented and\nilluminated by quotations from historical and contemporary sources. The\ndictionary organizes the meanings of words into meticulously delineated\nsenses, including obsolete ones. Together these methods help deliver a\nrichness of context and background that is hard to find elsewhere.\n\nBut it is not a dictionary built for convenience. Many entries are exceedingly\nlong. The entries for \u201cgo\u201d and \u201crun\u201d\u2014with more than 600 sense discriminations\neach\u2014are currently the longest, according to Ogilvie. Hoping to translate that\nlength into print terms, I checked the twenty-volume second edition of the\ndictionary, published in 1989; \u201cgo\u201d goes on for fifteen pages and \u201crun\u201d runs\nfor twenty.\n\nThough the OED is published by Oxford University Press, it is, in many\nrespects, the spiritual and intellectual opposite of an elite university. For\none thing, its admissions policy is quite forgiving. The dictionary is not\nreserved for an elite fraction of the English language. With some\nexceptions\u2014dirty words, for example, were suppressed for many years\u2014all words\nare welcome because the OED was conceived \u201cwith an impartial hospitality,\u201d as\nRichard Chenevix Trench, future Anglican archbishop of Dublin, said in his\n1857 lectures to the Philological Society, which led directly to the founding\nof the OED.\n\nA little over a hundred years after Samuel Johnson\u2019s mold-breaking dictionary\nhad introduced illustrative quotations to English-language lexicography and\ncast a powerful light on the great importance of sense discrimination, Trench\nwas trying to envision what an ideal dictionary would look like. He struck a\nvery different note than one found in Johnson, who was quite ambivalent about\nchange though finally confessed himself helpless to arrest the ravages of\ntime. With Trench, we see the beginning of a great about-face that led to a\nmore detached approach among lexicographers and a greater respect for words as\nthey exist.\n\nA dictionary, said Trench, \u201cis an inventory of the language.\u201d As for the\nlexicographer: \u201cIt is no task of the maker of [a dictionary] to select the\ngood words of a language.... The business which he has undertaken is to\ncollect and arrange all the words, whether good or bad.\u201d Or, as the OED\u2019s\nexuberant founding editor, philologist Frederick Furnivall, said, \u201cFling our\ndoors wide! All, all, not one, but all must enter.\u201d\n\nFurnivall was talking about words, of course, but he might have been talking\nabout people as well. For the OED was created with the help of many hands,\nmale and female, English and foreigner, living inside Britain and all over the\nworld. These readers\u2014incredibly helpful, unpaid volunteers who read what they\nwanted, but in some cases accepted rather exacting assignments\u2014helped make the\nOED what it is: a singular treasure trove of English-language history.\n\nThough the OED is published by Oxford University Press, it is, in many\nrespects, the spiritual and intellectual opposite of an elite university.\n\nA crowdsourced effort, the dictionary was led by a small professional staff\nwho understood their success was utterly dependent on the selfless amateurs\nworking for them. It had been done before (German dictionaries had\ncrowdsourced lexicography work), but it was still extraordinary, for it marked\nthe end of the era of the one-man dictionary, when individuals (Johnson,\nWebster, and many others), by themselves or with a little help, could make a\ndictionary from scratch. With the OED lexicography adopted the managerial\nmethods of modern industry and contracted help from a large work force\nmotivated by national and linguistic pride.\n\nThat day when Ogilvie visited the OED archives she happened upon a box. \u201cIt\nwas lighter than the others. I placed it on the floor and lifted the lid.\nThere, right on top, was a black book I had never seen before, bound with a\ncream ribbon.\u201d\n\nThe book belonged to James Murray, who took over as editor of the OED from the\nlively but disorganized Furnivall, leader of the project for its first decade,\nwhich was not a very productive one. A schoolmaster turned lexicographer,\nMurray put everything into the dictionary. Unstintingly thorough, he involved\nhis wife and children in the work and brought it with him on family vacations.\nFor good and ill, Murray made the extreme personal sacrifice necessary for the\ndictionary to thrive. Even so, it grew so slowly that its own editors, one\nafter the other, wondered if they would live long enough to see it completed.\n\nThe cream-ribbon-bound book of Murray\u2019s that Ogilvie discovered was the\nlinchpin of the whole enterprise. It contained the names and addresses of the\nmany volunteers who sent in quotations for the dictionary from their readings.\nThe pages were annotated with a code and included shorthand for work delivered\nand promised as well as updates on whether the reader had moved, married,\ngiven up, died, or otherwise gone silent. Who were these people? Ogilvie\nwondered. The Dictionary People is her answer.\n\nOrganized into twenty-six alphabetical chapters, each one presented under the\nheading of a salient characteristic (\u201cH for Hopeless Contributors,\u201d \u201cI for\nInventors,\u201d \u201cJ for Junkie\u201d), Ogilvie has written a dictionary of human beings\nwho helped create the OED. The Dictionary People even mimics a reference work\nin its use of cross references. Rest assured, though, the book is a\nstraightforward and compelling series of stories, not any kind of synoptic\ntreatment of lexicography.\n\nIf there is a \u201cseamy underbelly\u201d of lexicography\u2014as David Foster Wallace once\ninsisted in an essay on the so-called \u201cgrammar wars\u201d between prescriptivists\nand descriptivists\u2014this might be it. Take Chapter 3, titled \u201cC for Cannibal.\u201d\nJohn Richardson and his daughter Beatrice were among the first 147 volunteers\nworking under Furnivall, sending in slips with quotations. Richardson covered\nthe poetry of Robert Burns and earlier works of Scottish literature, while\nBeatrice read novels by Jane Austen and Walter Scott. But, quickly, this\nsketch of domestic bliss turns dark. A surgeon by training John had, many\nyears earlier, been a part of John Franklin\u2019s 1819 expedition to find a\nNorthwest Passage, in which eleven men died of starvation and three were\nkilled. Richardson himself killed one man who had fed Richardson and others\nmeat they later suspected was that of their murdered peers.\n\nA crowdsourced effort, the dictionary was led by a small professional staff\nwho understood their success was utterly dependent on the selfless amateurs\nworking for them.\n\n\u201cQ for Queers\u201d is the seventeenth chapter. But \u201cqueer\u201d (with its various and\nbarbed meanings) only begins to describe Katharine Bradley and Edith Cooper,\nwho bonded over their shared enthusiasm for dictionary work. They were indeed\nlovers and housemates, but also related by blood as aunt and niece.\nAdditionally, they were cowriters who published together under a single pen\nname, Michael Field. Field\u2019s poetry was compared to that of Swinburne and\nShakespeare and praised in the Spectator. Bradley and Cooper even kept a joint\ndiary.\n\n\u201cQueer\u201d is an example of a word that might have been admitted to the\ndictionary much sooner, as Ogilvie shows. Kept out of the OED until 1982,\n\u201cqueer\u201d was later found in the notorious missive that the Marquess of\nQueensberry wrote almost a century earlier to Oscar Wilde, which expressed\ndisgust at Wilde\u2019s relationship with the Marquess\u2019s son and led to a pair of\ntrials and Wilde\u2019s imprisonment for gross indecency. (The imprisonment, in\nturn, led to the \u201cBallad of Reading Gaol.\u201d) In that same decade, the 1890s,\nOgilvie mentions, Havelock Ellis explored the idea of the \u201cinvert\u201d in his book\nSexual Inversion, which understood homosexuality as a gender reversal. Ellis\ncollaborated with John Addington Symonds, whom the OED credits with the first\nuse of \u201chomosexual\u201d in 1891.\n\nOgilvie\u2019s investigation of Murray\u2019s notebook turned up an amazing amount of\nmaterial. Dictionary People is especially thick with tweedy eccentrics. There\nis Frederick Elworthy, a sheep farmer in Somerset who, according to Ogilvie,\n\u201chad one of the world\u2019s largest private collections of folklore charms and\namulets.\u201d Henry Spencer Ashbee, a family man and the manager of a London\ntrading firm, also \u201cowned the world\u2019s largest collection of pornography and\nerotica.\u201d A middle-class housewife in Kent, Mary Vernon also volunteered for\nthe British Rainfall Organisation, measuring rainfall and tracking other\nweather phenomena for that rather different crowdsourced effort. Leslie\nStephen, Virginia Woolf\u2019s father and one of the more skilled readers called in\nto help with special problems, led the Sunday Tramps, a group of intellectuals\nwho walked and hiked together on Sundays\u2014as agnostics, they emphatically did\nnot reserve the day for churchgoing.\n\nAmong the most prolific readers for the dictionary the subject of mental\nillness comes up a lot. Those already familiar with Simon Winchester\u2019s\nabsorbing take on the OED, The Professor and the Madman, will be surprised at\nhow much more there is to tell on this score. \u201cAll of Murray\u2019s top four\ncontributors had connections to mental asylums,\u201d writes Ogilvie, \u201cone as an\nadministrator and three as inmates.\u201d This comes in \u201cL for Lunatics\u201d (Ogilvie\u2019s\nheadings occasionally indulge in pre\u2013politically correct language), which\nhappens to be the longest chapter in the book.\n\nJohn Dormer was not only a reader but a subeditor who could be assigned\nespecially consuming jobs. For example, he was asked to create \u201cLists of\nSpecial Wants,\u201d which required him to \u201cexamine over 200,000 slips; sort them\ninto senses; order them chronologically; and identify any gaps in the\nquotation paragraphs that needed filling.\u201d One does not need great familiarity\nwith the inner workings of a dictionary to tremble at the thought of such a\ntask. Surely, at some point, a kind of snow blindness sets in, making the\ndirection of forward progress nearly impossible to make out. At the age of\nthirty-five Dormer began hearing voices and became convinced his next-door\nneighbors were drilling holes into the wall of his house to shoot at him and\nkill him.\n\nThe French call the members of their dictionary academy \u201cimmortals.\u201d Ogilvie\u2019s\nword nerds are all too human for such a moniker. They are outsiders and\nautodidacts. They struggle with vices. They lose their minds. They adopt\nquixotic causes such as spelling reform. Murray himself was one of several\npeople involved with the dictionary who were advocates for Glossotype, a\nsimplified spelling system that, if adopted, would have made his dictionary an\ninstant artifact. Yet the cause of the dictionary added prestige and even gave\nshape to the lives of its contributors. A. Caland, a Dutch schoolmaster whom\nMurray called one of the dictionary\u2019s \u201cmost devoted and helpful voluntary\nworkers,\u201d wrote, not long before his death, that \u201cthis interest was the one\nthing that kept me alive.\u201d\n\nThere is a curiously nostalgic cast to the many popularizing books published\nin recent years about reference works and the fading culture of print.\nOgilvie\u2019s valuable contribution, however, brings with it a refreshing\ndirectness that at once illuminates the history of the OED while connecting us\nto our predecessors, people like us, people of the book and of books, stalkers\nof information, obsessives one and all, for whom words mean even more than\nperhaps they should.\n\nThe Dictionary People The Unsung Heroes Who Created the Oxford English Dictionary Sarah Ogilvie Knopf $30 | 371 pp.\n\nDavid Skinner is an editor and writer who writes about language, usage, and\ndictionaries.
