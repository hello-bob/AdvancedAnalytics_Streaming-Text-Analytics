What practices can\nmitigate these instances?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nImagine you\u2019ve been in your new Staff+ role for six months. You feel you\u2019ve\ngained your peers\u2019 trust and you\u2019re now capable of handling the demands of\nyour role. However, despite your best efforts to focus on the \u201cright\u201d things,\nyour calendar is just a solid block of meetings you\u2019ve been asked to join.\nSlowly, it becomes apparent that others\u2019 expectations of you are not in line\nwith how you saw the role back when you started. You feel like you\u2019ve lost\nownership of your time, focus, and attention.\n\nBut shouldn\u2019t a Staff+ role inherently be autonomous? And if so, why doesn\u2019t\nit feel like it?\n\n## Business as usual\n\nIt\u2019s easy to be led. When we first start out as developers we have little to\nno autonomy over our day-to-day: our manager hands us tasks, provides us with\ncontext, and adds us to meetings. We\u2019re in the warm embrace of certainty. Once\nyou become a high-level individual contributor (IC), being directed quickly\nnets you a calendar stuffed with recurring meetings, \u201cjust a quick question\u201d,\none-on-ones, and more, leaving little breathing room or time for proactivity.\n\n## Breaking the cycle\n\nHow do you break that cycle? Being aware of it is a great first step. It\u2019s\nimportant that you take your time before starting this journey. You need to\nunderstand the current state of your job, projects, peers, and stakeholders,\nalongside building mutual trust and vulnerability with those in your team or\narea of impact.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve decided you want to be more self-directing in your role, the first\nstep\u2019s the easiest: talk to your manager and share your concern. Let them know\nyou intend to put what your responsibilities should entail in writing so that\nyou, and everyone around you, is aligned. Remember, your manager cares about\nyour time and focus so make sure to explicitly timebox this exercise. Know\nthat if they\u2019re not on board, you\u2019re not going to be set up to succeed.\n\n### A continuous effort\n\nThis process is iterative. Your role and its responsibilities will change over\ntime. There is no finished product, only its current iteration. Once you feel\nlike you, and those around you, are at least 80% aligned on your current area\nof responsibility then you\u2019re on the right track.\n\n## Introspection\n\nCreate a new \u201croles and responsibilities\u201d doc and start by listing out your\ncircles of influence. These might include a big project, your own team, a\nwider cohort you\u2019re a part of, or perhaps even the entire engineering\norganization. When adding the items you\u2019ll be focusing on, add them to one of\nthese circles.\n\nAdditionally, create an \u201cout of scope\u201d list, into which all of the items you\ndecide to remove should be soft-deleted.\n\nA useful model to employ when listing out items is the RACI Model, where each\nitem on the list is something you\u2019re responsible or accountable for, consulted\nabout, or informed of.\n\nNow, let\u2019s start filling out the document:\n\n  1. Others\u2019 expectations of you: list out everything you\u2019re already involved in \u2013 your business-as-usual. Add more things you believe are currently expected of you in your role. Open your company\u2019s career ladder, if it exists, and include responsibilities from there. Think about your manager, your peers, and your stakeholders \u2013 what pain points do they have that they are expecting you to solve?\n  2. Your expectations of yourself: take a moment to think about the things you\u2019d like to initiate \u2013 an infrastructure project? A change in culture? Is it time to dive into a new technology or methodology that might prove useful? Add those ideas, even if you don\u2019t believe you\u2019d have the time or focus to work on them.\n  3. Making it yours: what do you enjoy? What do you do best? What would help you grow? All of these questions are difficult to answer but are required so that your role isn\u2019t simply a slog through expectations, but rather both enjoyable and a chance to grow. Consider the Staff+ archetypes and your own abilities and wishes. At this point, you should also expect to use these guiding questions to discern which items need removing.\n  4. Drop the details: part of your role as a Staff+ engineer is the ability to create good abstractions and articulate tight narratives. Use this skill to find items on your list that should be merged and consider whether the merged item still tells the right story. \u201cPromoting good testing culture\u201d and \u201creducing bug count\u201d are examples of items probably best merged, while \u201cadvising the team on product X\u201d and \u201ccoding product Y\u201d probably can\u2019t be merged to \u201cworking on products\u201d because this generalization might be too broad and include products outside your remit.\n\nHowever, try keeping track of how involved you should be in each item (hands-\non, design only, mentoring someone else, etc.)\n\n  5. Scale back responsibility: you have so many things on your list it\u2019s impossible to accomplish them all yourself. What are your lower-impact items? What are the things that will make you miserable? Which of them do not bring you joy? What will be too much of a context switch from the other items on the list? Put these in your \u201cout of scope\u201d list.\n  6. Add weights: take the big items and add what percentage of your time you should be spending on each \u2013 per quarter. No need to do it for items that are too small. For instance, if you are expected to interview four times a week and each interview takes an hour, with half an hour dedicated to preparing and writing a summary, that would total 15% of your 40-hour week; interviews, therefore, become big items that need to be explicitly written out as such.\n\nAdd overall percentages for each circle of influence and decide whether that\u2019s\nthe right balance for your role, remembering that the total should be, at\nmost, 100%.\n\nDon't forget, these are not commitments or estimates, but weights that will\nhelp you communicate how much of your time should be spent on one area vs.\nanother.\n\nTake a while to go over these steps again and again. Your goal is to minimize\nthe number of items between which you will be splitting your attention while\nmaximizing your overall impact and how fulfilling the role will be for you.\nKeep at it until you feel like what you have in your hand is a good enough\ndescription of what you think your role should entail for at least the coming\nyear.\n\n## Collaboration\n\nThoroughly understanding your own perception of the role is great, but how\ndoes this inform and affect those around you? Foundationally, your role is a\ncollaborative one, so your subjective view of your position may not fall in\nline with others\u2019 perceptions of it. This requires you to work with those\naround you, so that you may all be aligned on your scope.\n\nNow is your chance to put your document to the test. You\u2019ll be discussing it\nwith your manager, your peers, and your stakeholders. But first, let\u2019s talk\nabout some preconditions.\n\n### Preconditions\n\nYour goal is not to tick the \u201cI talked to them\u201d box, but to get good, honest,\nand actionable feedback. To do that, you should be at a point where you\u2019ve\nbuilt relationships in which you can be open and vulnerable. You should have\nalready proved to those in your circles of influence that you proactively seek\ntheir feedback, take it well, and act on it.\n\n### The meetings\n\nNow it\u2019s time to start your meetings with this list of people. Be frugal with\nthe number of people you\u2019re meeting, so the process doesn\u2019t drag out too long.\nNot everyone\u2019s voices can be heard and some people\u2019s point of view has far\nmore weight than others.\n\nWhen reaching out to set your 1:1s with each of them, share why you\u2019ve decided\nto do this and what you\u2019d like to get from them. Set expectations about\nwanting to set expectations.\n\nIn each meeting go over the document together and discuss it, mostly\nuncovering false positives (\u201cI don\u2019t think you should be responsible for X\u201d)\nand false negatives (\u201cWait, I thought you were responsible for Y\u201d). Expect to\nget some different perspectives from each:\n\n  1. Your manager will help you understand what you should and shouldn\u2019t be focusing on from the organization\u2019s perspective. This is a great opportunity for them to think about what work they should delegate to you and consider what your career trajectory at the company should look like. This is a collaborative process. Challenge your manager if you feel you disagree on some points \u2013 it may take a few back and forths.\n  2. Your peers will help you understand where they see your role end and theirs begin. Should this line move? Should they collaborate with you on any of your projects or responsibilities? Do they think any of the things you listed are counterproductive?\n  3. Your stakeholders will help you understand how you\u2019re perceived outside your immediate organization and will highlight what they need from a good partner. The discussion will give them a glimpse of your overall responsibilities, which could create wonderful conversations.\n  4. Others you work closely with, for instance, senior engineers and engineering managers from other cohorts might be another source of outside perspective. Sharing your list with them might alert them to projects and priorities they hadn\u2019t considered \u2013 perhaps ones they will want to take ownership of. They may also be interested in your help as a consultant or mentor.\n\nBe ready to accept additions to your list that you either already removed or\ndid not expect altogether. That said, you should also be comfortable adding\nitems directly to your \u201cout of scope\u201d list. It\u2019s imperative, however, that\neveryone you talk to genuinely feels heard and involved.\n\nSome of these conversations will need to happen more than once as your\ndocument matures.\n\n### Outcome\n\nThis process concerns peoples\u2019 opinions, making consensus impossible. As\nmentioned before, if you\u2019ve gotten to a point where every person is around 80%\nin agreeance with your list \u2013 that\u2019s good enough.\n\nYou now have your own and other\u2019s expectations of you in writing. Now\u2019s the\ntime to share this document with colleagues and stakeholders, focusing on\nthose who weren\u2019t involved in the discussion stage; explain why it exists and\nshare a little bit about the journey taken to make it. Stress that this is an\niterative process and that the document you\u2019re sharing with them is the first\nversion of a document that will change as your role and circumstances evolve.\nSolicit their feedback.\n\nNow take a little time to refocus your inbox and calendar to match your\nnewfound responsibilities \u2013 withdraw from recurring meetings where you\u2019ve\ndecided to delegate and shift your 1:1 cadence toward those in more focused\nareas. You might want to also plan checkpoints every 2\u20134 weeks to avoid\nfalling into the trap of complacency.\n\nA nice side-effect of this process is that your \u201cout of scope\u201d list is\neffectively a list of gaps in ownership and is an invaluable tool for your\nmanager. Discuss it with them \u2013 maybe the responsibility should fall to one of\nyour peers, a new hire, or be shelved as a task for your future self.\n\n## The effort continues\n\nIt\u2019s been another 6\u201312 months. Taking a look at your document, you find that\nthings have changed quite dramatically:\n\n  1. Your work has changed: some of your initiatives matured, others have been dropped, perhaps your involvement in certain efforts has increased or decreased. Some projects are stealing the limelight, while others are put on the back burner.\n  2. The organization has changed: people get promoted, leave, are hired, and let go. There may have been a reorganization and you might even have a new manager.\n  3. You\u2019ve changed: your interests and abilities may have shifted and you\u2019ve gained more understanding of the organization and company. Your personal life may have dictated a change in priorities.\n\nYou\u2019re at a point where you and the world around you have outgrown your\nprevious perception of your role. It\u2019s time for you to take the next step in\nyour journey. You can now take the document you built previously and start the\nprocess of building its next version!\n\nGo to the next featured series slide Go to the previous featured series slide\n\n## Related content\n\nHow to embrace the never-ending leadership journey\n\n17 Apr 2024 Article\n\n## How to embrace the never-ending leadership journey\n\nPat Kua\n\n7 mins\n\nHow to communicate with an executive audience\n\n08 Apr 2024 Article\n\n## How to communicate with an executive audience\n\nDavid Kiger\n\n5 mins\n\nHow to develop your skill set for the AI era\n\n04 Apr 2024 Article\n\n## How to develop your skill set for the AI era\n\nJesal Gadhia\n\n6 mins\n\nUnderstanding stock options and RSUs as an engineer\n\n02 Apr 2024 Article\n\n## Understanding stock options and RSUs as an engineer\n\nDaniel Lee\n\n10 mins\n\nCan we cure imposter syndrome in tech?\n\n28 Mar 2024 Article\n\n## Can we cure imposter syndrome in tech?\n\nKelli Korducki\n\n5 mins\n\nThe reality of being a director of engineering\n\n27 Mar 2024 Article\n\n## The reality of being a director of engineering\n\nNathan Durant\n\n7 mins\n\nAsk Maria: How do I balance all my work without hiring?\n\n20 Mar 2024 Article\n\n## Ask Maria: How do I balance all my work without hiring?\n\nMaria Ntalla\n\n8 mins\n\nWhat is an engineering manager?
