I started with drag-\nand-drop programming, trying to figure out how to make a game in a tool called\nMicrosoft TouchDevelop. I recall making one or two things, but I mostly\ntinkered with what was made by the community; there was a vast gallery of open\nprograms with which you could play. I was curious about how I could make\nsomething new. At my computer, I could define a game.\n\nI never ended up being particularly good at game development. Still today,\nafter having played many video games in my teens, I struggle to come up with\nany ideas for gaming. With that said, my experience with TouchDevelop left a\nsignificant imprint on me that would manifest over the coming years: through\ncoding, I could make something. The process of doing so was intellectually\nstimulating. It may take hours to figure out how to do something, but in the\nend I had a script that I could run to make something happen.\n\nI have fond memories of programming the Raspberry Pi edition of Minecraft,\ncreating a command system modeled on the one available on the PC edition of\nMinecraft I had seen on YouTube. I enjoyed building the system to control the\nflow of commands. I loved figuring out how I could build a house in code, with\nhelp from magazines and a plethora of education resources.\n\nIn my early teens, I spent a significant amount of time playing video games.\nThat time was slowly replaced with time spent on writing and coding; two\nblooming passions. I was intrigued by the prospects of what I could make. I\nlearned basic web development through tinkering with web pages; changing\nattributes here and there to see how the page would look. (Although I wish I\nhad the wisdom to learn the fundamentals before hopping into frameworks and\ntrying to decipher advanced web pages with little merit!)\n\nToday, my joy of computing is stronger than ever I spent much of this\nafternoon watching videos about computing, touching on topics from consensus\nalgorithms (figuring out how to know the state of a system) to the role of\nprobabilities in compression. I love peeling back the layers of problems and\nlearning about how others have solved them. Compression is a topic to which I\nhave devoted many days of thought, in the process learning a lot and writing\nmany programs. Consensus algorithms came up in a project I am developing for\nidentifying the potential trustworthiness of a domain given classifications of\nthe Wikipedia page corresponding to the domain.\n\nI love learning about algorithms and how they work. I may not implement every\nalgorithm I learn, but knowing about them gives me a tool I can use later. I\nlove learning about how protocols, especially the web, came to be (and the\nperspective I get on why the systems of today are the way they are).\n\nI love the excitement of having an idea and starting to bring it to fruition.\nIn my childhood, this was a yearning: I had an intuition that with code I\nwould be able to make something fun. In adolescence, I explored the web, a\nmedium that ended up introducing me to much of what I know about computing\ntoday. In early adulthood, I have started to discover an appreciation for\ncomputer science, graduating from the nascent skills I had to being a bit more\ncapable with code.\n\nI find joy in studying how computers work, and writing programs that solve\nproblems using the tools I learn. Indeed, I could talk with you for an hour\nabout text compression or sentence classification or graph analysis or\nefficient retrieval of web pages.\n\nI love that code I write may inspire someone else to take an idea further than\nI can, or that my code may run to solve a problem I or someone else has.\n\nI love the feeling of encountering a problem in my code then, after research\nand reasoning, figuring out a solution. (Inversely, I am learning to accept\nwhen a problem is unsolvable given my current knowledge, and that I am best to\nmove on.)\n\nI love when I can chat with someone else about computing.\n\nI love that I can see how things work.\n\nI love that I can make something new with code.\n\n## Responses\n\n## Comment on this post\n\nRespond to this post by sending a Webmention.\n\nHave a comment?
