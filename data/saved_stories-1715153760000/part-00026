According to Gronda, replacing them costs nearly six figures each.\nThat\u2019s partly because they are swapped out along with the wheels they\u2019re\nmounted on. The Navy actually buys replacement Super Hornet tires as\nassemblies, receiving tires/wheel rims already mated to each other. Each\ntire/wheel assembly costs approximately $100,000.\n\nSINGAPORE STRAIT (July 6, 2017) U.S. Navy Aviation Electrician's Mate 2nd\nClass Lucas Mclean, left, from Arvada, Colo., U.S. Navy Aviation Electronics\nTechnician 1st Class Mathew Webber, middle, from Riverside, Calif., and U.S.\nNavy Aviation Machinist's Mate 2nd Class Ivan Avila, from Corona, Calif.,\nreplace the tires on an F/A-18F Super Hornet from, the \u201cBlack Knights\u201d of\nStrike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 154, aboard the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz (CVN\n68), July 6, 2017, in the Singapore Strait.

Mohr\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that wheels and tires on a carrier aircraft like the Super\nHornet lead hard, relatively short lives. Since 2019, the Navy\u2019s E/F fleet has\nprogressively undergone a multi-phase service life modification program which\nstretches the fighter\u2019s service life from 6,000 to 10,000 hours. Over that\nservice life Super Hornets make literally thousands of landings and takeoffs,\nboth arrested landings and catapult takeoffs from aircraft carriers and\ntakeoffs and landings from fixed bases. In the process they consume many\nwheels and tires, using them up particularly quickly during carrier\noperations.\n\nAn F/A-18E Super Hornet, attached to the \u201cGolden Warriors\u201d of Strike Fighter\nSquadron (VFA) 87, approaches the flight deck of USS Gerald R. Ford, August 6,\n2023. U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Tajh Payne\n\nGronda explained that F/A-18E/F pilots often land hard on carrier decks,\ncausing the fighter\u2019s main landing gear wheel rims to oblong and the tire\nmounted on the rim to shake. If the tire wobbles, he said, the wheel and tire\nassembly is taken off and discarded.\n\nThat gets expensive very quickly. \u201cWe go through 166 of these tires a year and\nthey cost six figures apiece,\u201d Gronda affirmed to the Sea Air Space audience.\nAccording to Boeing, Goodyear and Michelin supply rubber for the Rhino. The\nWar Zone reached out to each company asking for their tire price for the\nF/A-18/E/F. Both declined to share it. The main landing gear wheels are\nsupplied by Honeywell Aerospace, Aircraft Landing Systems which likewise\ndeclined to provide price information.\n\nAssuming a nominal $100,000 per-assembly price, simple math shows that the\nNavy\u2019s Super Hornet wheel assembly replacement bill for aircraft with out-of-\nround rims amounts to somewhere around $16.6 million per year.\n\nSailors pump air into the tires of an F/A-18F Super Hornet on the flight deck\nof USS Ronald Reagan, Philippine Sea, November 11, 2023.

Gronda explained that NAVAIR\u2019s AM team recognized\na possible opportunity to repair Super Hornet rims using solid-state cold\nspray 3D printing technology.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t an effective way to repair [them]... We realized that eighty\npercent of those rims are repairable with cold spray technology.\u201d\n\nCold spray is an additive manufacturing process that tweaks standard 3D\nprinting. In simple terms, tiny metal particles are mixed with a carrier gas\n(typically nitrogen or helium) and accelerated to Mach 2-3 speeds through a\nnozzle. For cold spray repairs, the particles are sprayed directly onto a\npart, adding material to build it back up and strengthen it.\n\nStaff Sgt. Chynna Patterson, a 28th Maintenance Group additive manufacturing\nspray technician, and David Darling, the 28th MXG additive manufacturing site\nmanager, wait for the VRC Raptor Cold Spray machine to heat up at Ellsworth\nAir Force Base, South Dakota, May 12, 2021. U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st\nClass Quentin K. Marx\n\n\u201cCold spray\u201d is a bit of a misnomer. The additive particles used are heated\nbut only to less than 80% of their melting point, rendering them fungible. The\nparticles coalesce into a solid state, creating a high-strength, structurally\nsound bond. Once applied, the new material is modified to match the original\nshape or tolerances of the part being repaired. In that way, solid-state cold\nspray is both an additive and subtractive process.\n\nThe Air Force has been using the cold spray process with additive\nmanufacturing machines since 2020, repairing rather than replacing everything\nfrom aircraft hinges to structural supports, shafts, and landing gear\ncomponents. The service used solid-state cold spray to repair an over-wing\nfairing slip joint for a B-1B in 2021. It\u2019s possible that the process may be\nused to aid in regenerating a decommissioned Lancer recently pulled from\nstorage as The War Zone reported.\n\nNAVAIR began adopting additive manufacturing technology over a decade ago and\nemployed it to build its first flight critical aircraft component \u2014 a 3D\nprinted link and fitting assembly for a V-22 Osprey engine nacelle \u2014 in 2016.\nSupply chain issues driven by the COVID-19 pandemic forced the Navy to\naccelerate its investment in, and use of, additive manufacturing beginning in\n2020. Today, NAVAIR has furnished 96 additive manufacturing devices to 33\nsites, including deployed aircraft carriers.\n\nAn MV-22B Osprey equipped with a 3D printed titanium link and fitting inside\nan engine nacelle maintains a hover as part of a demonstration at Patuxent\nRiver Naval Air Station, Maryland, July 29, 2016. NAVAIR\n\nThe Command uses a variety of 3D printers to make repairs to flight critical\ncomponents. In 2021 NAVAIR awarded a five-year IDIQ contract worth up to $5\nmillion to deliver fully-deployable 3D printing systems including Ultimaker S5\n3D printers.\n\nThat investment looks set to pay off across different platforms and equipment\ntypes including Super Hornet tire/wheel assemblies. In an email response to\nquestions from The War Zone, Gronda reaffirmed that the AM team\u2019s \u201cinitial\nassessment is that over 80% of the 166 [wheel rims/tires] sent to\n[scrapping/recycling] each year are repairable with this cold spray\ntechnique.\u201d\n\nHe added that the cold spray repairs to each take two hours and cost $300 per\nwheel. That works out to a total cost of about $40,000 to repair the rims and\nre-mount the tires annually. Set against a $16.6 million bill to simply\nreplace the assemblies as customary, AM repair looks like a no-brainer. Its\npotential to be employed in the field and/or in forward operating locations,\nlike an aircraft carrier, adds further value.\n\nFor example, the AM team recently facilitated the speedy provision of new\ncoupler fittings for a deployed aircraft carrier\u2019s optical landing system.\nThanks to fatigued couplers, the system had failed, preventing some of the\naircraft aboard from flying. Once contacted, the team redesigned the small\nfitting for 3D printing, tested it, received approval, and sent the coupler\ndata electronically to the ship where it was then printed.\n\nThat said, Navy fighter squadrons will not be making Super Hornet rim repairs\nat sea. According to Gronda, the environmental requirements that come with the\nmetal powders used during the cold spray process mean that such repairs can\nonly be done at shore-based installations and maintenance facilities at the\npresent.\n\nAn F/A-18E/F Super Hornet from Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 103 takes off\nfrom Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS George Washington, December 8, 2023.\nU.S. Navy Photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class August Clawson\n\nBut the broader repair-rather-than-replace idea that goes hand in hand with\nadditive manufacturing is inspiring NAVAIR and the Navy as a whole to\nreconsider its supply chain design and deployment, Gronda explained.\n\n\u201cCold spray is causing us to reevaluate items already in the supply system.\nThese items were previously deemed not repairable/consumable, so reevaluating\nthis process could help us reduce overall sustainment costs, harvest those\nsavings and reinvest in more critical DoD capabilities.\u201d\n\nIn February, NAVAIR and Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) opened the Naval\nAviation Schoolhouse for Additive Manufacturing in Danville, Virginia. With a\nteam of instructors on hand, six-week courses held at the schoolhouse will\nproduce a pipeline of AM artisans to meet growing supply and re-supply needs\nat lower cost and on shorter timelines.\n\nThe supply chain pressures that the Pentagon is under, from munitions to parts\nto equipment, combined with budget pressures and inefficiencies (right down to\npaying $90,000 for a simple bag of washers) will hopefully drive more\ninnovative approaches to fixing or locally manufacturing hardware instead of\nsimply firing the parts cannon at problems. A $16-plus million annual\nwheel/tire bill for a single fighter type, which could be reduced to less than\n$50,000, is the kind of opportunity that the services can\u2019t afford to\nsquander.\n\nContact the editor: tyler@twz.com\n\nF/A-18F/A-18E/FFightersNaval AviationNaviesU.S. NavySea Air Space 2024\n\nSign Up For Our Newsletters\n\nSign Up\n\n  * About TWZ\n  * The Team\n  * Contact Us\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Sitemap\n\n\u00a9 2024 Recurrent Ventures.
