A small number of humans are still required to push the buttons on\nthe machines and assemble the burgers and toppings, but the companies involved\ntout that using their technology could cut labor costs, perhaps dramatically.\n\u201cEat the future,\u201d they offer.\n\nI visited CaliExpress last week to find out what an all-American lunch served\nwith a side of existential dread tastes like. When I entered the restaurant,\nlocated near Caltech university in Pasadena, I was greeted with giant posters\nadvertising the \u201cfrying AI robot marvel\u201d, but few actual customers. Most of\nthe people inside were other journalists. A television crew hovered over the\ngrill machine.\n\nThe space was decorated with early prototypes of robot arms, as well as a riff\non Michelangelo\u2019s Sistine Chapel, with a human hand reaching out not to the\nhand of God, but to a robot claw holding french fries.\n\n> One of the first things I see l is this sign offering me $10 off if I sign\n> up with this facial recognition system to \u201cpay with just a smile.\u201d\n> pic.twitter.com/ZxLtLeHWCU\n>\n> \u2014 Lois Beckett (@loisbeckett) April 12, 2024\n\nI placed my order at a self-serve screen, where my robot-made cheeseburger and\nfries cost $15 plus tax. A sign urged me to \u201cpay with my face\u201d, offering me\n$10 to enroll with a company called PopID to link my face to my credit or\ndebit card. \u201cPay with just a smile!\u201d it urged. I did not.\n\nThe burger joint is a collaboration between multiple companies using it as a\n\u201ctest kitchen\u201d for the future of fast-food technology. The machine for making\nthe burgers is produced by Cucina, a company focused on automating food\nproduction, which described its \u201cBurgerChef\u201d as a solution to a \u201c65% increase\nin food service wages in the past 15 years\u201d. The french fry-making robot,\nFlippy, was created by Miso Robotics, a local startup founded by a group of\nCaltech grads.\n\nI was offered a tour of the kitchen by Denise Koons, who works with PopID, the\n\u201cbiometric ordering\u201d facial recognition company. She demonstrated the various\nstages of my order. She pushed a button on a nearby screen. The BurgerChef\nground a single burger\u2019s worth of wagyu steak to order and then squeezed it\nout from a tube and tucked it between two metal plates to brown. One hundred\nand ninety-five seconds later, a plastic arm rotated to receive the browned\nburger, ultimately dropping the meat into a waiting container.\n\n> I got to go behind the counter in the kitchen to film the steps closer up.\n> This is the grill bot, \u201cBurgerChef\u201d by Cucina, starting the process of\n> cooking a single burger pic.twitter.com/xIzoCo6Yks\n>\n> \u2014 Lois Beckett (@loisbeckett) April 12, 2024\n\nThe BurgerChef was a large, boxy piece of equipment that felt no more\nthreatening than a toaster oven, and was not particularly exciting to watch.\nFlippy, however, was the real star of the place, and absolutely terrifying.\n\nIt was just humanoid enough to be disturbing, with one big, snake-like arm\nextending down from the ceiling, poised over a frying station protected behind\na transparent window. Another press of a button, and the arm jerked up a\nwaiting metal fry basket and maneuvered it to one side, where a predetermined\namount of frozen potato slices tumbled down into the basket. Then Flippy\ndunked the basket into the sizzling oil, and we waited.\n\n> The real star of the show is Flippy, the robotic arm with \u201ccomputer vision\u201d\n> that fries the fries pic.twitter.com/1dh7oDW8hv\n>\n> \u2014 Lois Beckett (@loisbeckett) April 12, 2024\n\nFlippy was originally conceived as a grill-master robot that could flip\nburgers, hence the name, Rob Anderson, one of the co-founders of Miso\nRobotics, told me later. But manning a grill \u2013 keeping track of burgers and\ncheese and buns and onions, and being able to flip the different objects at\nthe proper time \u2013 turned out to be a tremendously sophisticated robotics\nproblem, one too tricky for the startup to tackle, he said. So they decided to\npivot to a simpler challenge: making a robot that could manage a frying\nstation, what Anderson argued was \u201cprobably the most stressful and dangerous\ntasks in the kitchen\u201d for human workers, and thus a good task for a robot,\nwhich would not be burned by hot oil or bothered by the heat.\n\nAs I watched a giant metal arm encased in rubber pick up the fry basket again\nand shake it roughly, I had only one thought: the future of sex robots is\ngoing to be very unpleasant.\n\n## What does AI actually do?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear to me how the restaurant differed from other robot-assisted\noperations, of which there are now many across California and the US. So I\nfollowed up with Anderson to find out how exactly AI was being put to use.\n\nHe explained that Flippy\u2019s AI components were designed for subtle and\ndifficult tasks, such as adjusting to differently sized kitchens and ranges.\nIt also had computer vision, a type of artificial intelligence that uses\nmachine learning and neural networks to allow computers to act on visual\ninputs, like photos or videos, in the way that humans respond to sight.\nFlippy\u2019s computer vision was continuously monitoring where the fry baskets\nwere placed, so if a human worker replaced one in a slightly different spot,\nthe machine would simply adjust.\n\nThe robot wasn\u2019t limited to french fries: it could also fry chicken wings and\nonion rings, and could detect when onions had been place inside the fryer,\nrather than potatoes, and adjust its fry times automatically, he said.\nArtificial intelligence also informed the robot\u2019s \u201cscheduling and forecasting\u201d\nabilities, like deciding \u201cwhat is the right order to cook all this food so\nit\u2019s still cooked perfectly\u201d during the lunch hour rush or slower times in the\nafternoon.\n\nFlippy, a robot with the ability to cook burgers and fries. Photograph:\nCourtesy of Miso Robotics\n\nFlippy was not designed to replace human workers completely, but to be a\n\u201ctool\u201d to make their work easier and safer, Anderson said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very much this collaborative setup,\u201d he said, adding that working\nalongside robots would teach people \u201cnew skills\u201d that are \u201cmore career growth\noriented, rather than just learning how to cook french fries\u201d.\n\nI asked Anderson what those skills would be, other than knowing how to push\nbuttons.\n\nWhile Flippy\u2019s interface was designed to be very simple, Anderson said,\nemployees would have to master \u201chow it works, how to clean it, how to keep it\noperating\u201d, and how to get in touch with the robotics support line when it\nmight need service or repairs. Flippy could not clean itself: it needed wipe-\ndowns every night, and more intensive cleanings monthly and quarterly. Human\nemployees could also do \u201cmore customer engagement work\u201d, he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t\njust have to sit there and monitor a fryer.\u201d\n\nFlippy-style fryers were already at work in multiple locations of fast-food\noutlets including White Castle and Jack in the Box, Anderson told me: \u201cWe\u2019ve\ngot a fleet of robots out there.\u201d\n\n## Tasting the results\n\nSo, after all the hype, how good were the robot-made burgers and fries?\n\nThe robot burger, despite its higher-quality In-N-Out burger-style house sauce\nand fresh lettuce and tomato, was thoroughly mediocre. The beef was a little\nrubbery. Flippy\u2019s fries, I admit, were crispy and nicely browned, not the limp\npotato offerings that often emerge from fast-food restaurants. I ate them\nhappily, but did not crave more.\n\nA still image from CaliExpress\u2019s YouTube video. Photograph: YouTube\n\nBeef burgers and fries are the only options currently on the menu. One of the\nlone ordinary customers who came in during my visit asked some questions, but\nleft without ordering. (He told me he wanted a veggie burger.) Another man\nwalked in while talking on his cellphone, took a look around, and walked out\nagain.\n\nAfter I left CaliExpress, I found myself driving to the closest McDonald\u2019s,\nwhere I ordered another cheeseburger prepared by other humans. It was smaller,\nand the ingredients were clearly cheaper, but I found myself savoring the\nwell-honed flavors of this drive-through classic.\n\nAnd I had set a timer: the humans had taken only one minute and 26 seconds to\ndeliver a fresh burger into my hands. I felt my shoulders relaxing as I took a\nbite: so far, the humans were still faster than the machines.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Artificial intelligence (AI)\n  * Fast food\n  * Robots\n  * Food\n  * Computing\n  * California\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
