We are scholars of cyberwarfare who have cataloged and analyzed the\nvarious cyber operations conducted during the war by Hamas, Israel and other\nnations and hacking groups supporting one side or the other. The data paints a\npicture of an unseen facet of the conflict, and it offers insights about the\nnature of cyber conflict more broadly.\n\nThe main conclusion we\u2019ve drawn is that the consequences of cyber conflict are\nprimarily felt by civilians, not the soldiers or militants actively engaged in\nthe fighting. We find that the damage cyberattacks inflict on digital systems\nis far less significant than the resulting harm to humans, and the resulting\nupward spiral of violence.\n\n## Hamas\u2019 cyberwarfare activities\n\nThe cyberattacks hitting Israeli government and civilian systems have had\nmixed effects. Some technically simple attacks succeeded in obtaining crucial\nintelligence that assisted Hamas fighters\u2019 incursion into Israel. Other\nattacks employed a scattershot approach, targeting anything within digital\nreach \u2013 hospitals, universities, banks and newspapers. These attacks didn\u2019t\nserve any military purpose, but simply aimed to disrupt Israeli life and\nterrorize the public.\n\nThe quantity and sophistication of the attacks have made clear that hackers\nworking for the government of Iran, a key Hamas funder and supplier, are\nsupporting Hamas\u2019 online warfare. Other \u201chacktivists\u201d and private hacking\ngroups based in countries as varied as Sudan, Pakistan and Russia have also\njoined the fray.\n\nBefore the deadly Oct. 7, 2023 terror attack on Israel that sparked the\ncurrent war, Hamas cyber operatives were working to support the attack\nplanning. A Hamas hacking unit called Gaza Cybergang spied on Israel in search\nof sensitive information about Israeli military installations. The information\nthey gleaned was instrumental during the attack.\n\nHamas hackers also conducted phishing attacks, relatively simple attacks in\nwhich fake email or text messages resemble legitimate ones and encourage a\nuser to either reply with sensitive information or click on a link that\ndownloads malicious software to their computer or mobile phone.\n\nAs the Oct. 7 attack unfolded, the pro-Palestinian hacktivist group AnonGhost\nreleased a mobile app with the same name as a prominent reputable app that\ngives Israeli citizens warnings about impending attacks from Hamas into\nIsrael. AnonGhost issued false alerts \u2013 including, reportedly, one about a\nnuclear attack \u2013 and collected users\u2019 data, including their contacts, call\nlogs and text messages.\n\nHowever, since full-fledged hostilities erupted, Hamas has been largely unable\nto carry out effective cyberattacks that aid its war efforts. As a result, the\ngroup turned to information warfare, seeking to evoke panic and shift public\nopinion.\n\nThe most common type of attack that Hamas\u2019 cyberwarriors and their allies use\nnow is a distributed denial-of-service, when a barrage of nonsense internet\ntraffic is aimed at one or more websites, email servers or other internet-\nconnected systems. They get overwhelmed by the nonsense traffic and either\nshut down or cease to function properly.\n\nDenial-of-service attacks have hit websites for news media outlets, banks,\nfinancial institutions and government agencies. One attack took the Jerusalem\nPost website offline for two days. The group that claimed responsibility for\nthat attack was a religious hacktivist group called Anonymous Sudan, with\nknown connections to Russian hacking groups.\n\nHamas and its online allies are also using wiper malware, which infects a\ncomputer and destroys its data. This kind of attack does not serve a purpose\nsuch as extortion or surveillance \u2013 it just aims to destroy everything in its\nwake.\n\nWe also recorded several attacks that infiltrated databases and released their\ncontents, such as one where the private data of students at Ono Academic\nCollege was published online.\n\nAnother series of attacks took control of digital billboards to display the\nPalestinian flag in sites around Israel, along with false news about military\ndefeats. These attacks are part of a broader misinformation effort designed to\nshape domestic debate and terrorize Israeli civilians.\n\nElectronic billboards have been hacked to display pro-Palestinian messages\naround the world, including this one in Spain.

Without any targets to strike on a\ndigital battlefield, Israel\u2019s primary strategy has been to turn on or off\ninternet connectivity in Gaza. It can do this because Israel controls the\nelectricity and internet cables that serve Gaza.\n\nOn Oct. 27, 2023, Israel imposed a near-total telecommunications blackout that\nlasted for approximately 34 hours. The telecommunications blackout was\ncondemned by international organizations, including the World Health\nOrganization, whose director general posted that the blackout made it\n\u201cimpossible for ambulances to reach the injured.\u201d Without internet or\ntelephone connections, injured Palestinians in Gaza can\u2019t call an ambulance,\nnor can medical staff stay connected with their dispatch centers.\n\nSimilar internet shutdowns have occurred frequently since then. Due to damage,\ndisplacement and power and internet disruptions, internet connectivity in Gaza\nhas been reduced to 15% of the typical rate.\n\nDuring periods when there was internet service in Gaza, pro-Israeli\nhacktivists got involved. For example, the group WeRedEvils crashed the Gaza\nNow news site. As hostilities intensified, up to 60% of all traffic to\nPalestinian websites was made up of denial-of-service attack traffic,\naccording to Cloudflare, a U.S.-based data-transfer and tracking company. The\nbulk of the attacks were aimed at banks and technology companies.\n\nThe U.S. is involved, too. The federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure\nSecurity Agency is working with the Israelis to help thwart some cyberattacks.\n\n## A few observations about online conflict\n\nIn contrast to Hollywood depictions of cyber warfare, where unstoppable\nhackers can cripple entire armies and countries with the push of a button, the\nreality of cyber power is more constrained. Digital battles cannot win wars.\nMost of the online operations in the Israel-Hamas war have little effect on\nthe actual battlefield. They involve spying or propaganda, not wholesale\ndestruction.\n\nOur data shows that cyber warfare doesn\u2019t necessarily give terror groups the\nability to face major powers on more equal terms. Hamas\u2019 online operations\nhave not been able to offset Israel\u2019s military superiority. But Israel\u2019s\nonline capabilities are not a significant advantage against a largely offline\nopponent.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, though, is our recurring finding that civilians are\nthe foremost victims of cyberattacks during war. In our experiments, conducted\namong more than 10,000 people over 10 years, we have seen that cyberattacks\narouse severe psychological distress \u2013 akin even to the harm generated by\nphysical terrorism. When confronted with cyberattacks, people feel trapped and\nanxious, and their sense of safety plummets. As a result, victims lash out and\ndemand strong retaliation in a way that fuels cycles of violence.\n\nAs Israel and Hamas volley cyberattacks back and forth, innocent people are\ncaught in the crossfire. This human dimension of cyber warfare is the threat\nthat worries us.\n\n  * Israel\n  * Spying\n  * Malware\n  * Gaza\n  * Hamas\n  * Internet spying\n  * Phishing\n  * Misinformation\n  * Cyberwar\n  * cyberactivism\n  * Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack\n  * Palestinians\n  * Cyberattacks\n  * internet blackout\n  * cyberwarfare\n  * Israeli military\n  * Israel-Hamas conflict 2023\n  * Gaza residents\n  * Israel-Hamas war\n  * Israel-Hamas\n  * War in Gaza\n\n### Events\n\nMore events\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * ##### Scheduling Analyst\n\n  * ##### Assistant Editor - 1 year cadetship\n\n  * ##### Executive Dean, Faculty of Health\n\n  * ##### Lecturer/Senior Lecturer, Earth System Science (School of Science)\n\n  * ##### Sydney Horizon Educators (Identified)\n\nMore jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n\n", "frontpage": false}
