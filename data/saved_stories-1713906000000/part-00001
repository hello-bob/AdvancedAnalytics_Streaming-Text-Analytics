Without our collective action, AI\u2019s expansion will\naccelerate the hospital industry\u2019s race to the bottom and drastically limit\nnurses\u2019 ability to provide quality care.\n\n### What is AI?\n\nThere are many types of AI. Simply put: AI is technology that attempts to\nmimic human intelligence, often based on software algorithms, which are rules\nfor calculating or processing massive amounts of data. In the health care\ncontext, AI and algorithms are often produced based on patients\u2019 Electronic\nHealth Records (EHRs) and other sources of data collected from patients and\ntheir environment.\n\nNurses are not against scientific or technological advancement, but we will\nnot accept algorithms replacing the expertise, experience, holistic, and\nhands-on approach we bring to patient care.\n\nNurses know that AI technology and algorithms are owned by corporations that\nare driven by profit \u2014 not a desire to improve patient care conditions or\nadvance the nursing profession. The hospital industry, in cooperation with\nSilicon Valley and Wall Street, will use AI to further its dangerous effort to\ndisplace RNs from the physical care of their patients prioritizing low-cost or\nfree labor over patient needs.\n\n### Key examples of AI in nursing\n\nStaffing and scheduling:\n\n  * Quantifying nursing workload and patient acuity levels, which influences shift staffing decisions and RN-to-patient assignments.\n  * Why it\u2019s problematic: Patient acuity measurements \u2013 dependent on RNs charting in real-time, which we know is rarely possible, and patient data, which is often incomplete \u2013 result in inappropriate nurse-to-patient ratios and unpredictable scheduling (for example, RNs being called in for overtime or sent home early, often on short-notice). Instead, patient acuity measurements should be based on an RN\u2019s holistic/hands-on assessment.\n\nClinical prediction:\n\n  * Flagging potential changes to medical conditions of patients through measurements from biometric and monitoring devices like microphones, video cameras, and sensors.\n  * Why it\u2019s problematic: This technology forces RNs to respond to excessive, if not faulty, alerts \u2013 which sometimes mistakenly flag that a patient\u2019s safety is in jeopardy \u2013 rather than using their knowledge and skills of observation to assess how to meet the needs of all patients. Conversely, patients who are at risk for deterioration are often missed by AI technology, which would have otherwise been caught by a thorough hands-on assessment from highly-trained medical professionals.\n\nRemote patient monitoring:\n\n  * Facilitating models of care that remove RNs from direct patient care. Sensors track patient movements and biometric information, through which patient data is collected and only flagged to an off-site technician or nurse if the algorithm assesses any of the information to be concerning.\n  * Why it\u2019s problematic: This contributes to an ongoing effort by the hospital industry to maximize revenue by pushing care onto less-skilled medical workers, or even non-medical workers in remote settings (for example, the patient\u2019s home). Over time, this will dramatically limit opportunities for nurses to care for patients in a hospital setting.\n\nAutomated charting and nursing care plans:\n\n  * Producing step-by-step treatment and care plans outlining interventions and procedures to be performed, including handoff reports to RNs on the next shift.\n  * Why it\u2019s problematic: Previously, RNs \u2013 not algorithmic models \u2013 would determine care plans for their patients using their professional judgment and clinical experience. AI technology also automatically completes note-taking that can miss important details and nuances about the patient.\n\n### Why should union nurses fight back against the deployment of AI in our\nworkplaces?\n\n  1. Patient care requires \u2014 and will always require \u2014 nurses. Life-and-death decisions relating to patient acuity, treatment decisions, and staffing levels cannot be made without the assessment skills and critical thinking of registered nurses. For example, tell-tale signs of a patient\u2019s condition, such as the smell of a patient\u2019s breath and their skin tone, affect, or demeanor, are often not detected by AI and algorithms.\n  2. Patient care cannot be ceded to AI technology, which has been demonstrably prone to serious inaccuracies and biases. In addition to a lack of well-designed research, clinical trials, and post-implementation evaluation, the makers of algorithmic and AI software are not required to disclose how their algorithms work or why they produce a given result. AI systems as currently deployed are \u201cblack boxes\u201d without any transparency and without any input from RNs.\n  3. AI creates opportunities for exploitation and scapegoating of nurses. AI technologies enable mass surveillance of nurses and other health care workers at facilities, with disturbing opportunities for employers to violate individual privacy and union organizing rights. It also increases the risk of liability for RNs, whose licenses may be on the line for erroneous decisions made by the models, which hospital management and software companies might refuse to accept liability for.\n  4. Profit-driven AI threatens to deskill nursing care and put patients at risk. Overreliance on AI \u2014 and the subsequent fragmentation of RNs\u2019 complex, holistic knowledge into discrete tasks \u2014 will undermine RNs\u2019 professional judgment. Assessing patients and developing nursing plans for therapeutic interventions is both an art and science, grounded in education and judgment honed through years of professional experience.\n\n## Press releases\n\n### California Nurses Association demand patient safeguards against artificial\nintelligence technology\n\nHundreds of registered nurses and members of California Nurses Association\nwill hold a protest at Kaiser Permanente's San Francisco Medical Center to\nhighlight their patient safety concerns about artificial intelligence\ntechnology and the hospital industry\u2019s rush to implement untested and\nunregulated AI.\n\nCalifornia Nurses Association\n\nApril 18, 2024\n\n### Nurses in Wichita and Austin demand Ascension address dual crises of\nworkplace violence and short staffing\n\nNurses at Ascension hospitals in Wichita, Kansas and Austin, Texas are\ndemanding that Ascension make contractual commitments to address the dual\ncrises of workplace violence and short staffing, which are threatening patient\ncare at the chain\u2019s hospitals.\n\nNational Nurses Organizing Committee/National Nurses United\n\nAugust 30, 2023\n\n### Nurses stand with striking writers, actors in fight against AI\n\nRegistered nurses will hold a solidarity march and rally in Los Angeles,\nCalif. on August 29 in support of striking actors and writers.
