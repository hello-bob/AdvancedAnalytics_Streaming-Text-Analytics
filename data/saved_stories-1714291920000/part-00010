One thing that I\nhave seen people get tripped up on is how they describe teams.\n\nAmbiguity about what a team is can create tensions, rework, and confusion and\nultimately get in the way of the work.\n\nTo help, I\u2019ve been developing a team taxonomy so that some of my clients and\ntheir teams can have better conversations about differences and similarities\nand hint at the expectations of interactions. This post shares these\ntaxonomies in case they are useful to others, too.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that people find team categorisation valuable when thinking about\ntheir organisations. The popularity of Team Topologies, which focuses on\nsoftware organisations, shows just that. You\u2019ll see some crossover with those\ntopologies here.\n\nI hadn\u2019t yet seen a taxonomy specific to some of my clients\u2019 situations\u2014ones\nthat reflect the reality of their worlds and also help elevate enabling teams,\nlike business operations, to equal importance as the digital delivery teams\u2014so\nI created this one, which has proved helpful to my clients.\n\n## Team Taxonomies\n\nFour classifications define the team types, and they are as follows.\n\nTeams fall into one of these types...\n\nTeam Type\n\nEnabling and empowering\n\n(Mostly) works to enable or empower other teams and people through internal\noperations, support, platforms, products or services.\n\nOR\n\nUser outcome aligned\n\n(Mostly) works towards delivering end-to-end outcomes that create value for\nend users.\n\n... with one of these makeups ...\n\nTeam Makeup\n\nMultidisciplinary\n\nA mix of capabilities and disciplines, collaborating daily towards common\ngoals or outcomes.\n\nOR\n\nSpecialist\n\nMostly made of the same skill set or profession, collaborating daily towards\ncommon goals or outcomes.\n\n... operating in this mode ...\n\nTeam Mode\n\nLong-lived\n\nA team that stays together on an ongoing basis, even through team member\nchanges.\n\nOR\n\nTemporary\n\nA team that is set up for a defined period or specific outcome and then\ndisbanded.\n\nAND they could also be\n\nRoving\n\nA team that collaborates with other teams on a specific task or outcome and\nthen moves on to work with another team.\n\n... spanning one of these areas.\n\nTeam Span\n\nWhere the team works, specific to the makeup of a particular organisation,\nsome examples are.\n\n  * Within a programme/area\n  * Across one or more programmes/areas\n  * Across an organisation\n\n## Putting it together\n\n## Examples\n\nA finance team could be\n\nAn enabling and empowering, specialist, long-lived team working across the\norg.\n\nAn agile delivery team could be\n\nA user outcome aligned, multidisciplinary, long-lived team working within an\narea.\n\nA coaching team could be\n\nAn enabling and empowering, specialist, long-lived team and roving team,\nworking across areas.\n\n## What to think about next\n\nHaving these taxonomies is the first step towards understanding the teams; the\nother things to consider are how they operate and how others engage with them.\n\nEach team will likely have different ways of managing their work and backlog,\nsuch as ticketing systems or monthly planning and prioritisation.\n\nTeams may also have other specific operating methods. For more on that and\nsome approaches to team dependencies, take a look at Team APIs from Team\nTopologies.\n\nTeams will need to collaborate and communicate with others, often across\ndifferent taxonomies. See my model, The Team Onion, for approaches to\nidentifying who they are and creating shared responsibility across team\nboundaries.\n\nIf this resonates with you and you found this post useful, please let me know\nin the comments.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\n\n### Related\n\n#### Understanding needs for building digital / agile capability\n\nI do a fair bit of training with organisations that want to become more agile.\nThe conversation often starts with \"can you give agile training to our\nstaff?\". This is a starting point for a conversation but needs a bit more\ndigging before I can understand what the real need is...\n\n10 April 2017\n\nIn \"Agile and Lean\"\n\n#### Why can\u2019t we all just get along?\n\nI initially gave this talk at Lead Agile Brighton in October 2022, then\nupdated and refined the slide deck for Agile Manchester in May 2023, so I\u2019ve\nupdated this post too. I've noticed an increasingly worrying trend in the\nindustry of focus on specialisms at the expense of collaboration, shared...\n\n3 November 2022\n\nIn \"Collaboration\"\n\n#### The Team Onion. How many pizzas does it really take to feed your team?\n\nThe Team Onion now has a new home at teamonion.works **UPDATE** The Agile Team\nOnion is now the Team Onion, same model slightly new name. Because you don't\nneed to be an agile team to use it. I've recently been playing with ways of\nexplaining the extended team for large...\n\n14 May 2016\n\nIn \"Collaboration\"\n\nCategories: Agile and Lean\n\n## Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
