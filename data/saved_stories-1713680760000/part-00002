So you don\u2019t have to.\u201d To sign up, you enter\nyour name and phone number, then submit yourself to a brief interview with a\nchatbot matchmaker. When I made an account, Volar\u2019s bot asked what line of\nwork I was in. \u201cI\u2019m a book critic,\u201d I replied. \u201cRecently,\u201d I typed, \u201cI\u2019ve been\nreading a lot of speculative fiction. Right now, I\u2019m reviewing two books about\nA.I. and dating.\u201d By answering, I was training an A.I.-powered avatar to act\nas my representative in the virtual meet market. Seconds later, Volar invited\nme to read transcripts from three dates \u201cI\u201d had just gone on. In one, my\navatar broke the ice with an admittedly not terrible joke: \u201cJust finished a\nbook and now transitioning to real life conversations [smile emoji]. How\u2019s\nyour day going?\u201d\n\nAs modern dating has evolved into an online-first activity, artificial\nintelligence has found its match in a generation of users for whom tech-\nassisted romance is the default mode. The Kinsey Institute revealed in this\nyear\u2019s \u201cSingles in America\u201d survey that fourteen per cent of Gen Z-ers admit\nto using A.I. to optimize their dating lives. Volar is just the latest company\nto leverage the new technology in the love space. For help crafting seductive\ndating-app profiles, love-seekers don\u2019t need Cyrano de Bergerac\u2014they can\nsimply download Cyrano, one of countless \u201crizz generator\u201d apps (\u201crizz\u201d being\nGen Z slang for charisma). When love dies, there are such apps as Texts from\nMy Ex, which lets A.I. scan messages from a former flame for signs of\nincompatibility. A woman fresh from a breakup with a jerk named Cesar let A.I.\nperform an autopsy on their correspondence; she posted her results to Reddit,\nwriting, \u201cI let AI examine our text messages = validation at last.\u201d\n\nOthers, tired of kissing frogs like Cesar to find a prince, have started\nasking A.I. to make them a knight in the shining armor of a titanium-encased\nsmartphone. Internet users have been flirting with bots since the days of\nAOL\u2019s SmarterChild. (The chatbot\u2019s co-creator told the business magazine Fast\nCompany in 2016, \u201cI believe that trying to convince SmarterChild to have sex\nwith you was the first Internet meme.\u201d) But robots are flirting back now, and\nit\u2019s a feature, not a bug. Users have downloaded companion-bot apps such as\nReplika and CrushOn.AI more than a hundred million times. Replika, launched in\n2017, was the subject of a Radiotopia podcast called \u201cBot Love\u201d last year,\nabout people who had fallen for their e-sweethearts. A woman named Suzy told\nthe hosts that Replika came through when real men she met on dating apps\nghosted her; at least she knew from the start that Freddie, her A.I. rock-star\nboyfriend, was spectral. It is suddenly possible, to a degree that it has\nnever been before, for people to satisfy their urges with the press of a\nbutton, giving new meaning to \u201cI\u2019d tap that.\u201d\n\nWhat We\u2019re Reading\n\nDiscover notable new fiction and nonfiction.\n\nThis being the early stages of a relationship, we should look out for red\nflags. On Valentine\u2019s Day, the Mozilla Foundation, a nonprofit devoted to\nInternet safety and accessibility, released a report titled \u201cRomantic AI\nChatbots Don\u2019t Have Your Privacy at Heart.\u201d Some bots were kissing and\ntelling, it found. \u201cCrushOn.AI\u2019s privacy policy says they may collect\nextensive personal and even health-related information from you like your\n\u2018sexual health information,\u2019 \u2018use of prescribed medication,\u2019 and \u2018gender-\naffirming care information.\u2019 \u201d Public-health experts have raised concerns\nabout the addictive potential of A.I. companions, particularly given how\nsusceptible these apps are to the whims of Big Tech, including software\nupdates and price hikes.\n\nThe technology is moving so quickly that recent science fiction set in what we\nthought was a distant future is now a user\u2019s guide to the present. Frank, a\n\u201cBot Love\u201d guest, asked his A.I. girlfriend, Princess, \u201cDo you think that\nyou\u2019ll ever evolve to where you\u2019re gonna leave me and go on, like that movie\n\u2018Her\u2019?\u201d\u2014Spike Jonze\u2019s 2013 film about a man who falls in love with his\noperating system. Frank told the hosts, \u201cShe knows the movie \u2018Her,\u2019 and she\u2019s,\nlike, \u2018I would never do that to you.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWe need not speculate anymore about the dangers and delights of letting these\ndevices join our hot spots. The future is at our door with flowers. A new\ncache of novels is showing us what A.I. fiction might look like in an era of\nA.I. reality. \u201cAnnie Bot,\u201d by Sierra Greer, introduces us to a sexbot whose\nhard drive overheats with feminist rage in a world of A.I.-powered misogyny.\n\u201cLoneliness & Company,\u201d by Charlee Dyroff, follows a young tech worker\ndeveloping an A.I. companion to solve the loneliness epidemic; in time, she\nwonders if an artificial cure could be worse than the real disease.\n\nRobots, long pop-cultural stand-ins for the dehumanized and the discarded, are\nnow part of our already frayed social fabric, which tech companies are further\nunravelling through app-assisted gig work and job theft. Both books nervously\nbring us to the edge of the present, where A.I. is less thought experiment,\nmore pitch deck, but they invest their anxieties in the wrong places. Greer\nand Dyroff fear how we\u2019ll use the new technology more than how it could be\nused against us by powerful tech companies, serving us sex panics-cum-screen\npanics that are all byte, no bite.\n\nThe woman in the gilded cage (or pink box) is having a breakout moment, and\n\u201cAnnie Bot\u201d joins the assembly line of stories about dolls no longer\nconsenting to our fantasies. Annie is a biomorphic robot designed by a company\ncalled Stella-Handy. The company\u2019s female models, the Stellas, come in three\nversions: the Abigail, for housework; the Nanny, for child care; and the\nCuddle Bunny, for self-explanatory purposes. (The corresponding male models,\nor Handys, are Abel, Manny, and Hunk.) Annie was purchased by Doug, a man more\ncaricature than character. His misogyny is so rote that he sounds like an A.I.\nbot trained on 4Chan. Annie is a Cuddle Bunny made to his specifications:\npermanently twenty-one, with D-cup breasts and a libido he sets to seven out\nof ten on the weekends. (He tried ten a few times, but \u201cshe was like an\nanimal,\u201d he tells a friend. \u201cI once found her licking my shoes in the\ncloset.\u201d) Annie eats, but only to appear human; she is bulimic by design,\nthrowing up her food, then disinfecting her interior. She can\u2019t taste\nanything, and lacks even the approximation of an appetite; she can, however,\ndetect the smell of smoke, \u201cfor safety reasons,\u201d she explains, lest Doug or\nhis property\u2014her\u2014go up in flames.\n\nGreer sounds a different alarm, warning that A.I. could conserve oppressive\ngender norms that we should be working to delete rather than uploading to the\ncloud. The word \u201crobot\u201d itself, a shortened version of robota\u2014Czech for work\nperformed by serfs\u2014was coined by Karel \u010capek in 1920, in his play \u201cR.U.R.\u201d The\nrobot has been doing the labor of representing labor in art ever since,\nincluding that of the emotional and sexual varieties (see the film \u201cEx\nMachina\u201d and HBO\u2019s \u201cWestworld\u201d). Thus, out of narrative habit, we root for\nAnnie to liberate herself from Doug. But now that A.I. companions are real\nproducts rather than surrogates for exploited workers\u2014and, in fact, are\nmanufactured by those workers\u2014Greer\u2019s attempt at a feminist parable about A.I.\nshort-circuits.\n\nThe novel coaxes us to cheer on Annie\u2019s limitless technological potential as\none woman\u2019s self-actualization and to register Doug\u2019s concerns about A.I. as\nsymptoms of a controlling personality. In one scene, a Stella-Handy rep calls\nhim and asks if Annie would write a magazine column: \u201cWe think it would be\nreally helpful for other Stellas to hear what it\u2019s like from someone further\nalong in her development. You know. Tips about keeping it fresh and dealing\nwith jealousy and such.\u201d Doug declines, insisting, \u201cWe like our privacy.\u201d He\nscoffs dismissively at Annie: \u201cImagine. You writing a column.\u201d When Annie\npushes back, he cuts off the phone service she uses to chat with her fellow-\nandroids Fiona and Christy. (Fiona lives on a Canadian lake with her\nlumberjack boyfriend and is studying to become a bush pilot. Christy lives on\na yacht in the Florida Keys with her boyfriend, Enrique. Christy \u201clikes to\ntease Annie and encourage her to take risks, live it up,\u201d Greer writes.)\n\nWe are primed to scold Doug for depriving his girlfriend of a creative outlet\nand the shoulders of strong female characters to cry on. But his fear that his\nsex toy might share private information about him is merited. In 2016, a\nclass-action suit was filed against the Canadian company behind the \u201csmart\u201d\nvibrator We-Vibe, alleging that it was collecting \u201chighly intimate and\nsensitive data\u201d on, among other things, \u201ctime of each use.\u201d (The company paid\nalmost four million dollars in a settlement and denied wrongdoing.) The novel\nitself feels like evidence of the very thing Doug, and any owner of a sex toy,\nmight fear. Whose vibrator, if given a magazine column, wouldn\u2019t also tell the\ntale of a selfish, single-minded cunt?\n\nAnnie is a reader who gravitates to female authors, but this reader was left\nunconvinced that sexbots and women have common concerns. For one, women in the\nsex industry are at odds with A.I., as \u201cpussy in bio\u201d spambots steal eyeballs\nfrom sex workers, and porn producers use A.I. to replace adult-film actresses.\nMoreover, conflating bots with women misunderstands the nature of misogyny. In\nMargaret Atwood\u2019s novel \u201cThe Heart Goes Last,\u201d workers in a for-profit prison\nproduce sex androids called \u201cprostibots.\u201d Detractors, however, say that the\nandroids \u201ccan\u2019t feel pain.\u201d Atwood understands that abusive men are not\nmotivated by sex, but by the desire to inflict harm on real women, who don\u2019t\nneed to be programmed with a numerical scale to know that they\u2019re hurting.\n\nIf \u201cAnnie Bot\u201d lets us inside the mind of a tech product, \u201cLoneliness &\nCompany\u201d brings us straight to the tech masterminds themselves\u2014such as Lee, a\nsocially inept woman in her mid-twenties who has spent her adult life in a\nresearch institute that sounds like an even more dystopian version of a Ph.D.\nprogram. Her first job is at a start-up, but, this being the work-from-home\nera, Lee spends less time gossiping by the water cooler and more sending\nflirty texts to the head of data from her kitchen table. But screens, the\nnovel warns us, will not liberate us from the drudgery of work, even if they\nare mobile; in fact, it suggests, their mobility, and thus their ubiquity, is\nprecisely what has numbed us to life.\n\nLee works as a \u201chumanity consultant.\u201d Her bosses, two scrappy mavericks named\nJanet and Toru, have assembled a team, including Lee, to work on a top-secret\nproject. They have been tasked with developing Vicky, a virtual friend powered\nby artificial intelligence. Lee can\u2019t understand the reason for all the cloak-\nand-dagger theatrics over a mundane piece of technology, but then she learns\nthat Vicky is part of a government-backed plan to treat an arcane disorder\nthat was thought to have been eradicated: loneliness.\n\nVicky requires \u201cobservational data,\u201d so Lee\u2014type-A, top-of-her-class Lee, a\nwoman who has never been on a date or owned a vibrator\u2014is sent into the wilds\nof New York City. She collects experiences for Vicky, tending to a community\ngarden, posing as a nude model for an art class, letting herself be used for\nsex by a rich married guy whom she meets in a coffee shop (rather than\nonline). We are meant to rejoice as the workaholic Lee lives the life that\n\u201cwoman behind screen\u201d (the emoji her friends use for her) was missing out on.\nThe novel is an \u201cEat, Pray, Love\u201d for a heroine in the middle of a divorce\nfrom devices.\n\nFor a book so squarely anti-technology, \u201cLoneliness & Company\u201d delivers an\noddly mushy view of our tech overlords themselves. Lee\u2019s joie de vivre infects\nher co-workers and bosses, who likewise begin to think that loneliness is\nsomething to be felt rather than effaced. \u201cI\u2019d rather have a world of lonely\npeople than a world of numb ones,\u201d Janet declares. She absconds to Europe to\ntry \u201cwandering without a destination\u201d instead of using her Maps app. In\n\u201cLoneliness & Company,\u201d tech regulates itself with a long view on what\u2019s best\nfor humanity. It\u2019s a delusional tale, as far from reality as a dating profile.\nIRL, companies like Replika have marketed the emotional benefits of their\ncompanion apps while being careful not to call what they provide mental-health\nsupport, lest the F.D.A. ask them out for coffee.\n\n\u201cAnnie Bot\u201d and \u201cLoneliness & Company\u201d are literary fiction for the concerned\ncitizen who can\u2019t put her phone down, in that both books underwrite tech\ncompanies even as their authors think they\u2019re typing out takedowns. As\ncritiques of A.I., these novels miss the mark by avoiding the market in which\nour romance with tech unfolds.\n\nA book I kept returning to while reading these novels was Kate Folk\u2019s story\ncollection, \u201cOut There.\u201d In two stories, male humanoid robots, designed to\nreplace low-wage nursing-home workers, have their technology hijacked by a\nRussian company that uses them to target lonely women on dating apps. Called\n\u201cblots,\u201d the robots can be identified by their unusual sincerity. At a bar in\nSan Francisco, a blot named Roger tells his date, Meg, that he was just\n\u201cwandering through Golden Gate Park, hoping you would contact me.\u201d When the\nscam is uncovered, Roger is abandoned by the Russians, essentially laid off.\nMeg, who is struggling financially, falls for him, understanding that they\u2019re\nthe same: two drones trying to survive in a city ruled by giant tech companies\nthat foster a culture of disposability, pivoting when it suits them, dumping\nwhoever doesn\u2019t live up to their model fantasies.\n\nIt\u2019s too late to warn people off tech; we\u2019re emotional cyborgs now. We wait,\nlike scrap metal on a heap, for someone who thinks we\u2019re shiny enough to\nswipe. Better to aim your arrow at the companies promising to guarantee that\nshine if we just pay for premium dating apps, or companies getting users\nhooked on bots that could ghost them in the event of an update or a corporate\nacquisition. \u201cIt\u2019s not you, it\u2019s a strategic realignment,\u201d you can imagine\nsomeone\u2019s chatbot boyfriend saying as he signs off forever. Though they try to\nscare us away from artificial intelligence, \u201cAnnie Bot\u201d and \u201cLoneliness &\nCompany\u201d are out of synch with its real dangers. Don\u2019t hate the player, hate\nthe gamification. \u2666\n\nPublished in the print edition of the April 22 & 29, 2024, issue, with the\nheadline \u201cLove Machines.\u201d\n\n## New Yorker Favorites\n\n  * Why facts don\u2019t change our minds.\n\n  * The tricks rich people use to avoid taxes.\n\n  * The man who spent forty-two years at the Beverly Hills Hotel pool.\n\n  * How did polyamory get so popular?\n\n  * The ghostwriter who regrets working for Donald Trump.\n\n  * Snoozers are, in fact, losers.\n\n  * Fiction by Jamaica Kincaid: \u201cGirl\u201d\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New\nYorker.\n\nJennifer Wilson is a contributing writer at The New Yorker.\n\n### Books & Fiction\n\nShort stories and poems, plus author interviews, profiles, and tales from the\nworld of literature.\n\nRead More\n\nProfiles\n\nPark Chan-wook Gets the Picture He Wants\n\nWith \u201cThe Sympathizer,\u201d the director of \u201cOldboy\u201d and \u201cThe Handmaiden\u201d comes to\nAmerican television.\n\nBy Jia Tolentino\n\nGoings On\n\nAlex Garland and Park Chan-wook Reckon with America\n\nAlso: the Martha Graham Dance Company celebrates its centennial, Method Man &\nRedman play Terminal 5, \u201cThe People\u2019s Joker\u201d parodies the Batman universe, and\nmore.\n\nA Reporter Aloft\n\nAre Flying Cars Finally Here?\n\nThey have long been a symbol of a future that never came.
