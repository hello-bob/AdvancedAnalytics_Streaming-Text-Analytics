A far smaller share (16%) say it\u2019s\ngoing in the right direction, and about a third (32%) are not sure, according\nto a Pew Research Center survey conducted in November 2023.\n\nHow we did this\n\nPew Research Center conducted this analysis to understand how Americans view\nthe K-12 public education system. We surveyed 5,029 U.S. adults from Nov. 9 to\nNov. 16, 2023.\n\nThe survey was conducted by Ipsos for Pew Research Center on the Ipsos\nKnowledgePanel Omnibus. The KnowledgePanel is a probability-based web panel\nrecruited primarily through national, random sampling of residential\naddresses. The survey is weighted by gender, age, race, ethnicity, education,\nincome and other categories.\n\nHere are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and the\nsurvey methodology.\n\nA majority of those who say it\u2019s headed in the wrong direction say a major\nreason is that schools are not spending enough time on core academic subjects.\n\nThese findings come amid debates about what is taught in schools, as well as\nconcerns about school budget cuts and students falling behind academically.\n\nRelated: Race and LGBTQ Issues in K-12 Schools\n\nRepublicans are more likely than Democrats to say the public K-12 education\nsystem is going in the wrong direction. About two-thirds of Republicans and\nRepublican-leaning independents (65%) say this, compared with 40% of Democrats\nand Democratic leaners. In turn, 23% of Democrats and 10% of Republicans say\nit\u2019s headed in the right direction.\n\nAmong Republicans, conservatives are the most likely to say public education\nis headed in the wrong direction: 75% say this, compared with 52% of moderate\nor liberal Republicans. There are no significant differences among Democrats\nby ideology.\n\nSimilar shares of K-12 parents and adults who don\u2019t have a child in K-12\nschools say the system is going in the wrong direction.\n\nA separate Center survey of public K-12 teachers found that 82% think the\noverall state of public K-12 education has gotten worse in the past five\nyears. And many teachers are pessimistic about the future.\n\nRelated: What\u2019s It Like To Be A Teacher in America Today?\n\n#### Why do Americans think public K-12 education is going in the wrong\ndirection?\n\nWe asked adults who say the public education system is going in the wrong\ndirection why that might be. About half or more say the following are major\nreasons:\n\n  * Schools not spending enough time on core academic subjects, like reading, math, science and social studies (69%)\n  * Teachers bringing their personal political and social views into the classroom (54%)\n  * Schools not having the funding and resources they need (52%)\n\nAbout a quarter (26%) say a major reason is that parents have too much\ninfluence in decisions about what schools are teaching.\n\n#### How views vary by party\n\nAmericans in each party point to different reasons why public education is\nheaded in the wrong direction.\n\nRepublicans are more likely than Democrats to say major reasons are:\n\n  * A lack of focus on core academic subjects (79% vs. 55%)\n  * Teachers bringing their personal views into the classroom (76% vs. 23%)\n\nIn turn, Democrats are more likely than Republicans to point to:\n\n  * Insufficient school funding and resources (78% vs. 33%)\n  * Parents having too much say in what schools are teaching (46% vs. 13%)\n\nViews also vary within each party by ideology.\n\nAmong Republicans, conservatives are particularly likely to cite a lack of\nfocus on core academic subjects and teachers bringing their personal views\ninto the classroom.\n\nAmong Democrats, liberals are especially likely to cite schools lacking\nresources and parents having too much say in the curriculum.\n\nNote: Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and\nthe survey methodology.\n\nTopics\n\n  * Education\n  * K-12\n  * Partisanship & Issues\n  * Political Issues\n\nShare This Link:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Mail\n\nRachel Minkin is a research associate focusing on social and demographic\ntrends research at Pew Research Center\n\nbiobio\n\nPostsPosts\n\nEmail\n\n### Related\n\nshort readApr 11, 2024\n\n## About 1 in 4 U.S. teachers say their school went into a gun-related\nlockdown in the last school year\n\nreportApr 4, 2024\n\n## What Public K-12 Teachers Want Americans To Know About Teaching\n\nreportApr 4, 2024\n\n## What\u2019s It Like To Be a Teacher in America Today?\n\nreportFeb 22, 2024\n\n## Race and LGBTQ Issues in K-12 Schools\n\nreportFeb 1, 2024\n\n## From Businesses and Banks to Colleges and Churches: Americans\u2019 Views of\nU.S. Institutions\n\n### TOPICS\n\n  * Education\n  * K-12\n  * Partisanship & Issues\n  * Political Issues\n\n### Most Popular\n\n1\n\nWhat\u2019s It Like To Be a Teacher in America Today?\n\n2\n\nThe Hardships and Dreams of Asian Americans Living in Poverty\n\n3\n\n81% of U.S. adults \u2013 versus 46% of teens \u2013 favor parental consent for minors\nto use social media\n\n4\n\nChanging Partisan Coalitions in a Politically Divided Nation\n\n5\n\nAmericans\u2019 use of ChatGPT is ticking up, but few trust its election\ninformation\n\n1615 L St. NW, Suite 800 Washington, DC 20036 USA (+1) 202-419-4300 | Main (+1) 202-857-8562 | Fax (+1) 202-419-4372 | Media Inquiries\n\n#### Research Topics\n\n  * Age & Generations\n  * Coronavirus (COVID-19)\n  * Economy & Work\n  * Family & Relationships\n  * Gender & LGBTQ\n  * Immigration & Migration\n  * International Affairs\n  * Internet & Technology\n  * Methodological Research\n  * News Habits & Media\n  * Non-U.S. Governments\n  * Other Topics\n  * Politics & Policy\n  * Race & Ethnicity\n  * Religion\n  * Science\n\n#### Follow Us\n\n  * Email Newsletters\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Tumblr\n  * YouTube\n  * RSS Feed\n\nABOUT PEW RESEARCH CENTER Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan fact tank that\ninforms the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world.\nIt conducts public opinion polling, demographic research, media content\nanalysis and other empirical social science research.
