The advertising is\npresented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change\nactions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that\nthey are in an urban zone.\n\nA large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online\nadvertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its\naudience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and\navoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles\nabout how to paint your house).

Your profile can be used (also later) to present\nadvertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by\nthis and other entities.\n\nIf you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this\ninformation could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike\naccessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a\ndifferent website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike\naccessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury\ncar manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your\ninterest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are\ninterested in luxury cycling gear.\n\nAn apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It\ngets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income\ncustomers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create\nprofiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to\nhave a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising\nwithin partner apps based on those profiles.\n\nVendors129 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * A.Mob\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdElement Media Solutions\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * AdSpirit AdServer\n  * AdTheorent\n  * AdTiming\n\n1-10 / 129\n\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\n\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising\nprofiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or\napps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and\npersonal aspects.\n\nAn online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes.

Because of seasonal differences, levels are higher in\nMay than in August.\n\n# Carbon Dioxide Levels Have Passed a New Milestone\n\nBy Aatish Bhatia\n\nApril 20, 2024\n\nCarbon dioxide acts like Earth\u2019s thermostat: The more of it in the air, the\nmore the planet warms.\n\nIn 2023, global levels of the greenhouse gas rose to 419 parts per million,\naround 50 percent more than before the Industrial Revolution. That means there\nare roughly 50 percent more carbon dioxide molecules in the air than there\nwere in 1750.\n\nAs carbon dioxide builds up in the atmosphere, it traps heat and warms the\nplanet.\n\n### More carbon dioxide, warmer temperatures\n\nSource: NOAA (carbon dioxide); NASA (temperature)\n\nThe chart shows the change in global surface temperature relative to\n1951\u20131980, versus global carbon dioxide levels. The dotted line shows the\ntrend line.\n\nEvery additional amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere contributes to\nmore warming, which is why climate scientists stress the need to get to zero\nemissions.\n\nCurrently, carbon dioxide levels are rising at near-record rates.\n\nAccording to data released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration\u2019s Global Monitoring Laboratory earlier this month, last year\nhad the fourth-highest annual rise in global carbon dioxide levels.\n\n### Annual change in carbon dioxide levels\n\nSource: NOAA\u2019s Global Monitoring Laboratory\n\nThe chart shows the increase in global carbon dioxide levels over the course\nof each year. In 2023, they grew by around 2.8 parts per million.\n\nThe long-term rise in carbon dioxide levels is caused by burning fossil fuels,\nas well as other human activities such as deforestation and concrete\nproduction.\n\nBut there is also a lot of variation from year to year, which you can see in\nthe chart above.\n\nHow much carbon dioxide levels rise in a given year depends on two factors:\nthe amount of fossil fuels burned globally, and the share of these emissions\nthat are absorbed by the land and the ocean.\n\nConsider the first factor: While it\u2019s true that clean energy production is\nrising globally, so is the demand for energy.\n\nFossil fuels have made up the difference. This is why global fossil fuel\nemissions are still at record-high values (with a brief dip during the\npandemic). And they stayed high in 2023, according to a projection by the\nGlobal Carbon Budget.\n\nNot all of these emissions end up in the air. The ocean and land absorb\nroughly half of the carbon dioxide that humans emit, while the rest stays in\nthe air, said Glen Peters, a senior researcher at the CICERO Center for\nInternational Climate Research.\n\n### Where do carbon dioxide emissions go?\n\nSource: Global Carbon Budget\n\nThe chart shows the net amounts of carbon dioxide emissions absorbed by the\natmosphere, land and ocean. The emissions are produced by burning fossil\nfuels, deforestation and other human activities. Data does not include 2023.\n\nThat one-half figure is an approximation. It varies from year to year\ndepending on weather conditions and other environmental factors, resulting in\nthe jagged lines you see in the chart above. For example, in a warm and dry\nyear with many wildfires, the land may absorb less carbon dioxide than usual.\n\nAs the Earth warms further, climate scientists expect the land and the ocean\nto absorb a smaller share of carbon dioxide emissions, causing a larger share\nto end up in the air, said Doug McNeall, who studies these effects at\nBritain\u2019s Met Office.\n\nXin Lan, the lead scientist responsible for NOAA\u2019s global carbon dioxide\nmeasurements, referred to the natural absorption as a \u201ccarbon discount.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe pay attention to it because we don't know at which point that this\ndiscount is gone,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition to carbon dioxide, the levels of other potent greenhouse gases\nlike methane and nitrous oxide are also on the rise, which further contribute\nto warming.\n\n## An exceptional year\n\n2023 was unusually hot, both on land and in the ocean. (The oceans absorb over\n90 percent of the excess heat caused by global warming.) It was the hottest\nyear in over 170 years of record keeping, even exceeding scientists\u2019\npredictions.\n\nOne contributing factor to 2023\u2019s extreme heat was El Ni\u00f1o, a climate pattern\nthat tends to raise global temperatures. During El Ni\u00f1o, warm ocean currents\nin the Pacific Ocean cause warmer and drier weather in the tropics. This can\nlead to droughts that slow the growth of trees and increase the risk of\nwildfires.\n\nWhen this happens, the land tends to absorb less carbon dioxide, and more of\nit ends up in the air. Several climate scientists said this may be why last\nyear\u2019s rise in carbon dioxide levels was substantially higher than in the\nyears preceding it.\n\n## Getting to zero\n\nThe current high emissions levels make the climate goal of limiting global\nwarming to 1.5 degrees Celsius increasingly difficult to reach.\n\nTo limit warming to this threshold, experts say countries need to slam the\nbrakes on global emissions and bring them down to near-zero in about a decade.\nAnd some are even considering more extreme technological solutions to help\nbridge the gap.\n\nEven if global emissions were brought down to half of their current value, we\nwould still continue to add carbon dioxide to the air, causing further\nwarming.\n\n\u201cYou need to bring them essentially down to zero in order to stop warming,\u201d\nMr. McNeall said.\n\nHow much more warming will occur depends on how long it takes for this to\nhappen.\n\nOn one hand, clean energy investments are booming, and renewable energy\nproduction is rising globally. But energy demand is also projected to rise,\ncoal power plants are still being built, and some sectors of the economy \u2014\nlike construction and manufacturing \u2014 are harder to decarbonize, making the\ntask ahead a steep challenge.\n\nEven if the world exceeds the 1.5-degree threshold, \u201cevery fraction of a\ndegree matters,\u201d Mr. McNeall said.\n\n\u201cThe closer that you can get to that threshold, the better.\u201d\n\nAbout the data\n\nNOAA\u2019s annual global carbon dioxide measurements are an average of thousands\nof measurements made near sea level at about 30 locations around the world. To\naccount for local differences in humidity, measurements are made using dry\nair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nEnjoy unlimited access to all of The Times.\n\nSee subscription options\n\n", "frontpage": true}
