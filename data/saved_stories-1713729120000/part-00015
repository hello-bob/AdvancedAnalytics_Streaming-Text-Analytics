If it\nworks for you, please leave a comment below so others may know!\n\nDisclaimer: Changing voltages or editing BIOS settings not surfaced by your\nlaptop manufacturer is risky and thus I give no guarantees or warranties that\nany of this will work well for you. This is merely a recap of my own\nexperiences with making my Vostro 7500 run faster!\n\nIn July 2020 there was a deal-stacking slick deal on Dell\u2019s new Vostro 7500\nlaptop with the Intel 10750H processor, so I went for it. But as hot as the\ndeal was, it turned out the laptop runs even hotter. HWiNFO showed that the\nthat the CPU package and cores quickly hit 100C, and the CPU thermal throttled\nupon opening pretty much any application. And unlike Intel laptops of the\npast, many in 2020, including the XPS, Vostro, and Inspiron, have undervolting\ndisabled by default due to the Plundervolt vulnerability.\n\nBut I discovered there are a few ways to keep the laptop cooler, including the\nability to unlock undervolting for the Comet Lake 10750H processor (skip to\nthis section for this) without needing to flash a modded BIOS. The following\nsteps allowed me to double my battery life, drop my idle temps by 20\u00b0C, and\nimprove my FPS, in reversible ways that shouldn\u2019t void the warranty, and most\napply to other 2020 Dell models like the XPS and Inspiron as well:\n\n  1. Easy BIOS Changes\n  2. Enable Advanced Windows Power Plan Options\n  3. Initial Throttlestop Tweaks\n  4. Disable Unneeded Startup Processes with Autoruns\n  5. Undervolt your NVIDIA GPU with Afterburner\n  6. Enable CPU Undervolting by Toggling Hidden BIOS Options\n  7. Manually Set Fan Speed with HWiNFO\n  8. Miscellaneous Vostro 7500 Learnings\n\n## Easy BIOS Changes\n\nThe fans rarely kicked on in my laptop even with temps above 70C, and I found\nout that the BIOS defaulted to an option where fans were a bit quieter/less\naggressive. If you enter the laptop BIOS and navigate/search for Thermal\nManagement, you\u2019ll see a \u201cUltra Performance\u201d setting which allows the fans to\nbe a bit louder / run more often. I switched my Thermal Management plan to\nUltra Performance and it seemed to help a bit.\n\nAnd while you have the BIOS open you might consider changing a few other\noptions:\n\n  * EcoPower Mode (Disabling this stops your screen brightness from changing on its own and allows your own brightness setting to stick.)\n  * Lid Switch (disabling it prevents the computer from turning on/off automatically when opening/closing the lid, which is annoying)\n\n## Enable Advanced Windows Power Plan Options\n\n  * Type \u201cregedit\u201d in the taskbar Search field & open Registry Editor\n  * Go to the folder HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Power\n  * Set the CsEnabled value to 0 (change it from 1 to 0)\n\nAfter a system restart, you will have extra options to choose from when you go\nto the Power Options area in the Control Panel:\n\nBefore the registry edit, there were only two plans to choose from!\n\nI have had a good experience with the Ultra Performance plan, with some\nsettings customized. If you click \u201cChange plan settings\u201d you can further tweak\nyour power profile. If you want to have even more tweak-able options, you can\nuse more Registry edits to unlock additional power savings settings within the\n\u201cChange plan settings\u201d menu as well.\n\n## Initial Throttlestop Tweaks\n\nThrottlestop is a free program that allows adjustments to processor-level\nsettings not visible in the BIOS and Windows options. You can make multiple\nprofiles which is great: I have a battery-optimized profile and a performance-\noptimized profile which are automatically applied based on if my charger is\nplugged in or not. Here are some Throttlestop suggestions for maximum battery\nlife:\n\n  * Speedstep/C1E/Power Saver: turn these on\n  * Speedshift \u2013 EPP: set to a high number like 255 for maximum battery life, pick a lower number for maximum performance.\n  * Disable Turbo: turn on for maximum battery life; won\u2019t let your computer achieve higher clockspeeds but 6 cores at 2.6ghz tends to be more than enough for the things I do on-the-go.\n  * BD PROCHOT \u2013 always keep this on so your computer won\u2019t reach too hot a temperature!\n  * PROCHOT OFFSET (Under Options) \u2013 My Dell Vostro thermal throttles when it hits 100C, but at this point my laptop is hot to the touch. Setting this offset to 10 for me had my computer instead throttle at 90C. The CPU won\u2019t hit as fast speeds but it keeps my laptop more comfortable to use and keeps the laptop speed down.\n  * Turbo Boost Power Limits (Under TPL) \u2013 the maximum wattage your CPU can hit. I set my Long Power Max and Short Power Max values to a much more conservative 35w/40w. (Clamp forces the processor to abide by these limits even if it has to throttle itself.)\n  * Speedshift Max Ratio \u2013 Changing this from 50 to 40 should keep your CPU from trying to hit too high clock speeds. If you set conservative power limits, you probably don\u2019t need to worry about this since your power limit will also prevent higher ratios from being reached.\n  * Enable Speed Shift when ThrottleStop starts \u2013 turned this on because I always want the above option to be utilized.\n\nThe most fun/useful Throttlestop options are under the FIVR menu, but are\nlocked by default on most new Dell laptops. I\u2019ll discuss later on how to\nunlock this menu so you can undervolt your CPU, but be warned it takes a lot\nof effort to do (but definitely worth it if you have the willpower!)\n\nHere is what my battery-optimized Throttlestop profile looks like (note some\noptions are redundant, certain SpeedShift levels won\u2019t be reached if Turbo is\noff anyway, Clock Modulation doesn\u2019t do anything for new CPUs, but this works\nfor me!)\n\nHere\u2019s what my performance-optimized profile looks like (note that the TPL\noptions are profile agnostic. For more performance, my power limits and\nSpeedshift max profile could probably be higher, but I\u2019d rather keep my CPU\ncooler):\n\nAnother thing to look at in Throttlestop is your processor\u2019s C-states.\nClicking the C10 button opens a window to show you how often your processor is\nentering certain processor states. Ideally when you are idling, you should\nhave your CPU package enter the C10 state at least some of the time so your\nCPU wattage is as low as possible / your battery life will be longer. Certain\nprograms, drivers, or processes can sometimes prevent this from happening, and\nif your CPU never enters a C10 state, updating drivers or removing startup\nprocesses can sometimes help fix this.\n\nIf your package C-States C7-C10 are never reached (e.g., they remain 0.0 in\nthe view above) when absolutely nothing is open on your computer (including\nbackground processes like updates or virus scans) you might want to experiment\nwith turning off processes and updating drivers.\n\n## Disable Unneeded Startup Processes with Autoruns\n\nThe less processes running on your computer, the longer your battery life.\nEspecially if any of those processes are preventing your CPU from entering a\nmore power-efficient C-State, as mentioned above. Autoruns is a great\nMicrosoft tool to quickly disable processes you don\u2019t have a need for.\n\nDownload and extract the tool, right-click Autoruns64.exe, and run as\nAdministrator. Uncheck any/all processes you know you don\u2019t need, which for me\nincluded a whole lot of pre-loaded Dell tools. You can be more aggressive and\ndisable all of the things, but you\u2019ll probably end up needing to re-enable\nsome of them for things like your sound or brightness hotkeys to work\nproperly.\n\nI disabled every Dell service and nothing bad happened, A++ would recommend!\n\n## Undervolt Your NVIDIA GPU with Afterburner\n\nThe Dell Vostro 7500 has a dedicated GeForce GTX 1650 Ti card, which allows\nfor gaming at moderate settings. However, it also generates a lot of heat\nwhich quickly affects the CPU temperature as well. While there\u2019s no way to\nreduce the power limit or set a voltage offset for a dedicated GPU on many\nDell Laptops, you can still undervolt the GPU by setting a custom\nvoltage/frequency curve.\n\nMSI Afterburner is probably the most popular tool to tweak graphics card\nsettings including frequency/voltage curves. When you open the app and select\nyour dedicated graphics card, you can hit Ctrl+F to open the frequency/voltage\ncurve, which for me, looks like this by default:\n\nThe default frequency-voltage curve for the Vostro 7500 GTX 1650 Ti\n\nYou can look at the frequency (Y axis) and voltage (X axis) to see that this\ndefault curve has the GPU hitting a max frequency of 1875mhz at 1.04v. But for\nme, this generates lots of heat that ends up generating heat that makes my CPU\nthrottle sooner. So I edited my GPU voltage curve to look like this:\n\nEditing the curve can be unintuitive and clumsy at times, but this video\nshould help you learn how to change the settings and get started.\n\nWith this flat voltage curve, my GPU won\u2019t ever hit a clock speed above\n1455mhz, but it will also stay at a steady voltage around 0.7v. This keeps my\nGPU and CPU much cooler when gaming. It\u2019s kind of counter-intuitive, but\nlimiting my GPU to a lower max frequency can give me higher FPS in CPU-bound\ngames as decreased heat from the GPU means my CPU doesn\u2019t thermal throttle\nuntil much higher clock speeds.\n\nThere\u2019s one big caveat about undervolting your GPU this way though: in my\nexperience MSI Afterburner is among the processes that can prevent your CPU\nfrom entering lower C-States. Which means if you are not gaming, this can end\nup hurting your battery life. I thus don\u2019t have MSI Afterburner open at\nstartup and simply open it up/apply undervolting before I open a game. This\nmight not be the case for everyone, but Afterburner potentially affecting CPU\nC-States and battery life detrimentally is something to be aware of, as it\u2019s\nbeen reported by others as well.\n\n## Edit EFI Variables to Enable CPU Undervolting\n\nThe most effective way to reduce the heat and improve battery life is to\nundervolt the CPU. These options are disabled by default in Throttlestop and\nIntel Extreme Tuning Utility (XTU) in most Comet Lake laptops because of\nPlundervolt. It takes a number of steps and tools, and is not for the faint of\nheart, but there is a way to unlock undervolting in 2020 Dell laptops. The\nfollowing steps in 2020 work for, at the very least, my Dell Vostro 7500,\nsomeone else\u2019s G7 7700 (h/t to this poster who helped me find the right\nsetup_var tool to use), and likely many other Dell models. This is the most\ntechnically complicated part, and I\u2019m not responsible for any inadvertent\ndamage done by trying the following steps. What follows is a step-by-step\nbreakdown of what worked for me, and it may not work for you.\n\n### Step 1: Dump a copy of your BIOS.\n\nDownload HWiNFO to see which version of Intel Manageability Engine your\ncomputer is using (it is listed under Motherboard > Intel ME)\n\nMy Dell Vostro 7500 has Intel ME Version 14.0\n\nBased on the version of Intel ME you are using, download the proper version of\nIntel ME System Tools listed here under header C2.\n\nUnzip the Intel (CS)ME System Tools folder, and open up a command line or\nPowershell shell terminal window as an Administrator and navigate to the\nlocation of the \u201cFlash Programming Tool\u201d folder in the directory you unzipped,\nby changing directory with a command like the below:\n\n    \n    \n    cd \"C:\\Users\\<username>\\Downloads\\Intel CSME System Tools v14.0.11- r1\\Flash Programming Tool\\WIN64\"\n\nOnce in the FPT folder, run the below command (different depending on your\nterminal of choice) to dump your current computer\u2019s BIOS to your PC (don\u2019t\nforget the -bios part, and definitely don\u2019t type something other than -d by\naccident, this tool can be dangerous if used improperly!):\n\n    \n    \n    # if using cmd.exe (Command Prompt) FPTW64.exe -d \"bios_dump.rom\" -bios # if using Powershell .\\FPTW64.exe -d \"bios_dump.rom\" -bios\n\n### Step 2. Extract Your System\u2019s Setup Settings with UEFITool\n\nWith the above BIOS dump in hand, it is now time to use UEFITool to search for\nthe settings we care about, specifically the Overclocking. Download, extract,\nand open the Windows app, and use the tool to open the BIOS dump we generated\nabove (File...Open Image File)\n\nOnce the BIOS image is opened, do a search (Ctrl+F) on the Text (not Hex\nPattern or GUID) for \u201cOverclocking Lock\u201d. You should find one match, within\nthe BIOS section of interest (\u201cSetup\u201d)\n\nThe Search match will be a child Section of the File we want to extract.\n\nRight click on the parent File that matched your search (e.g., Click the row\nthat has the Text \u201cSetup\u201d) and click \u201cExtract as is.\u201d Save this .ffs file\nsomewhere, we\u2019ll need it for the next step!\n\n### Step 3. Get a Human Readable Version of Your BIOS Setup Settings with IFR\nExtractor\n\nThe file we just extracted contains all of the toggle-able options your\ncomputer BIOS has, many of which Dell hides by default. We will need one more\ntool to get a human-readable version of these options, which is LongSoft\u2019s\nversion of IFR Extractor. (Older versions of IFR Extractor do not provide the\nlocation of the EFI variables you need to edit, but this one does.) Windows\nwarned me the file might be unsafe, but I had no problems with it; for those\nwho want to do due diligence, the repo/source code is here.)\n\nSimply open IFR Extractor, point it to the .ffs you extracted in Step 2, and\nclick extract. It will prompt you to save a .txt version of the file\nsomewhere. You now a nice, human-readable text file that includes all the\npossible options you can change. Time to open it!\n\n### Step 4. Find BIOS Setup Options of Interest\n\nWhen you open the IFR extracted text file, you\u2019ll see pages and pages of BIOS\nsettings as well as the location of these settings variables (variables are\naccessed at a given VarOffset within a given VarStore) in your NVRAM. In\nsimpler times, most BIOS options you wanted to edit were conveniently stored\nin a single Setup VarStore, but now they are spread across multiple VarStores,\nwhich makes things trickier.\n\nThe beginning of pages and pages of BIOS settings.\n\nBefore we go further, it\u2019s important to note that lots of these settings, if\nenabled or edited, can cause problems. I learned this when trying to force my\nVostro 7500 to run a 32GB stick at its rated XMP timings which soft bricked my\nlaptop. It refused to boot until I removed both the laptop battery and CMOS\nbattery, which reset the NVRAM. So while there are lots of seems-cool features\nlisted in the BIOS, it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re all going to work properly for\nyou. Just because you can set a insanely high or low voltage offset for your\nCPU, doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t fry your CPU or cause it to be too unstable to\nboot.\n\nThat said, there are many settings which, for most Dell laptops, may not cause\nany issues, and can allow you to do things like undervolt. For my Dell Vostro\n7500, I scrolled through the text file output by IFR Extractor and found two\nBIOS settings of interest (pictured below). Disabling each of them allowed me\nto undervolt my CPU with either Throttlestop or Intel Extreme Tuning Utility\n(XTU), with no ill-effects.\n\nOverclocking Lock \u2013 This option is stored at VarOffset 0xDA within VarStore\n0x3. If this variable is set to 0x0, the lock is disabled. If it is set to the\ndefault 0x1, it is enabled. A overclocking lock doesn\u2019t just prevent you from\nmaking your CPU run faster, it also prevents you from changing your voltages,\nincluding undervolting.\n\nCFG Lock \u2013 This option is stored at VarOffset 0x3E within VarStore 0x3. If\nthis variable is set to 0x0, the lock is disabled. If it is set to the default\n0x1, it is enabled. I\u2019m unsure if you need to disable this for undervolting,\nbut I did disable it in case I wanted to try the Hackintosh route in the\nfuture.\n\nThe VarStore that contains the Overclocking and CFG locks on my Vostro 7500\nhas VarStoreId 0x3. But we need the VarStore name. A Control+F reveals this:\nVarStoreId 0x3 has the name CpuSetup.\n\nWe now know everything we need to move on to the next step:\n\n  * Both the Overclocking Lock and CFG Lock options are stored in the CpuSetup VarStore.\n  * To disable the Overclocking Lock, we need to set VarOffset 0xDA to 0x0 (replace 0xDA with the VarOffset you see for Overclocking Lock on your own machine, as it may not be the same as mine!)\n  * To disable the CFG Lock, we need to set VarOffset 0x3E to 0x0 (replace 0x3E with the VarOffset for CFG Lock you see on your own machine, as it may not be the same as mine!)\n\n### Step 5. Prepare a EFI USB Boot Drive\n\nWe now will prepare a special USB flash drive that will allow us to set the\nabove \u201clock\u201d variables to 0x0. For readers who have used setup_var to modify\nEFI variables before, note that I am using a newer, special version of\nsetup_var someone made that allows users to modify variables at a specific\nVarStore name. Using the older, more popular setup_var command that\u2019s\nhardcoded to look at the VarStore named Setup won\u2019t work here!\n\n  1. Download the grubx64.efi file from v1.0 alpha release available here.\n  2. Get (or format) a blank FAT32 flash drive.\n  3. Create a folder called EFI. Within this EFI folder, create a folder called Boot.\n  4. Place the grubx64.efi folder above into the EFI/Boot folder path.\n  5. Rename grubx64.efi to bootx64.efi.\n\nYou should now have a flash drive with one file, bootx64.efi, located in the\npath X:/EFI/Boot (where X is your flash drive\u2019s drive letter.) Time to boot\nit!\n\n### Step 6. Disable Secure Boot in BIOS and Boot Prepared EFI USB Drive\n\nBefore your computer can boot the EFI flash drive, you will have to disable\nthe Secure Boot option in your BIOS. Then you can access the Boot Menu and\nselect your flash drive to boot into a modified GRUB terminal. You should now\nhave the ability to execute the command \u201csetup_var\u201d to read and edit settings\nof interest, which are stored as EFI variables.\n\nBefore you attempt to modify the values of our EFI variables, you should check\nthat the variables identified above (Overclocking Lock and CFG Lock) are able\nto be read and are set to 0x1 as we expect them to be. It is always good to\nfirst test reading the variables before writing them!\n\nYou can use the setup_var command along with the VarStore and VarOffset values\nassociated with your BIOS CFG Lock and Overclocking Locks to read their\ncurrent values:\n\n    \n    \n    setup_var [VarStore] [VarOffset]\n\nFor my Dell Vostro 7500, this returned my Overclocking Lock value:\n\n    \n    \n    setup_var CpuSetup 0xDA\n\n### Step 7. Edit EFI Variables of Interest\n\nAfter you confirm you can read the CFG Lock and Overclocking Lock EFI\nvariables, you can attempt to change them to a value of 0x0 to disable them\nwith this usage of setup_var:\n\n    \n    \n    setup_var [VarStore] [VarOffset] [Value]\n\nFor my Dell Vostro 7500, the following commands disabled my Overclocking Lock\nand CFG Lock:\n\n    \n    \n    setup_var CpuSetup 0xDA 0x0\n    \n    \n    setup_var CpuSetup 0x3E 0x0\n\nOnce you change the variables, you can simply unplug your flash drive, reboot,\nre-enable SecureBoot, and boot back into Windows. Everything should seem the\nsame as it was before, except now you can change CPU voltages in Throttlestop\nor XTU!\n\n### Step 8. Use the Newly Enabled Throttlestop FIVR Control to Undervolt Your\nCPU\n\nNow that the Overclocking Lock is disabled, voltage changes in Throttlestop\nwill actually work. Install and open Throttlestop and look for the \u201cFIVR\u201d\nbutton towards the bottom middle of the Throttlestop window. Clicking it\nshould open the below screen:\n\nFIVR Control, unlocked at last! Pictured are my actual Vostro 7500 day-to-day\nsettings.\n\nYou can now change the voltage offsets of your CPU. As always, undervolting\nyour CPU can cause instability and crashes, and undervolting is rarely a good\nidea in a laptop. For my Dell Vostro 7500, I was able to have a stable system\nwith a CPU/Cache undervolt of -0.100V and a GPU/System Agent Undervolt of\n-.0500V. The ideal values for you will probably differ, and if you are new to\nundervolting I extremely recommend reading through this great Throttlestop\nguide before touching any voltage controls.\n\nOnce you find the optimal undervoltage settings for your processor, you might\nfind it handy to have Throttlestop open/apply the settings at startup so you\ncan always have better battery life and lower temperatures. Here\u2019s a guide on\nhow to get that set up.\n\n### Step 9. (Optional) Prevent Dell from taking your undervolt away!\n\nCongratulations, you made it so far (look at that scroll bar!) All that work,\nand you hopefully have a undervolt. But watch out: Dell has a history of\nrolling out automatic BIOS updates with Windows 10 that can undo the above\nsteps, forcing you to repeat this process each time your BIOS gets updated.\nWorse, Dell could potentially roll out a BIOS that prevents you from\nundervolting at all!\n\nLuckily, most Dells have an option in the BIOS to prevent Windows from\nautomatically updating your firmware, keeping your undervolt safe (but\npotentially exposing you to security flaws that go unpatched). If you\u2019d rather\nhave undervolting than security fixes, look for the \u201cUEFI Capsule Firmware\nUpdates\u201d setting in your BIOS and turn it OFF. Nice try Dell, but this\nundervolt is here to stay!\n\nDisabling UEFI Capsule Firmware Updates in the BIOS will reduce the risk of\nyou losing your undervolt, but also prevent Dell from automatically providing\nfixes and security patches.\n\n## Manually Set Fan Speed with HWiNFO\n\nIf you find your fan isn\u2019t running as aggressively as you\u2019d like and you\u2019re\ntrying to run benchmarks or otherwise want the fan kicking into full gear for\nan extended period of time, you can manually set the fan speed with HWiNFO.\n\nLaunch HWiNFO and click the \u201cSensors\u201d button towards the top of the window.\nYou may first be met with a warning screen, but afterwards you should see this\nwindow:\n\nIf you click the fan Icon next to the arrows in the bottom left, you should\nget access to fan control for your laptop fans:\n\nNote the scary warning at top, this is also a step that can end poorly if you\nrun your fans harder than they\u2019re meant to run. But for me, I was able to set\nFan 1 and Fan 2 speed manually, and/or adjust the respin period to a more\naggressive 100ms so the fans kicked on much more quickly.\n\n## Miscellaneous Vostro 7500 Learnings\n\nHere are some other things I wish I knew about the Vostro 7500 before getting\nit:\n\n40GB RAM Possible\n\nThe official Dell documentation suggests that the maximum supported RAM\ncapacity is 24GB. This is not the case, as I put a 32GB HyperX Impact 2933\nSODIMM into the RAM slot and my system sees the full 40GB of RAM. One caveat\nis that the RAM runs at a lower speed: 2666 instead of 2933.\n\nThis blog post that looked at a similar 10750H laptop suggests a negligible\ndifference in performance differences between 2666 and 2933 RAM speeds, even\nwhen RAM timings were the same. My RAM running at 2666 has much tighter\ntimings than my 2933 RAM, so the overall RAM increase to 40GB is definitely\ngoing to help my performance even if my RAM runs a little slower.\n\nDP1.2 Limits Potential of USB-C Hubs\n\nThunderbolt 3 gives the Vostro 7500 an edge: it enables the use of eGPUs and\nsuper fast external drives. But one downside is the DisplayPort spec on the\nVostro 7500 is 1.2, not 1.4. This limits your ability to drive 4K video at\n60Hz to multiple displays, and will prevent you from taking full advantage of\nUSB-C hubs that rely on DP1.4 for pushing multiple displays at higher\nresolutions and refresh rates. Still better than a normal USB-C port though!\n\nAnyway, I hope this was helpful to those in the same boat as me who wanted\nmore battery and less heat out of their new Dell laptops. Please post any\nquestions, ideas, or other findings/comments on the Vostro 7500 in the\ncomments below.

Michael\n\nSeptember 9, 2020 at 3:14 pm\n\nHi, thank you for posting your experience with this system. i just got mine\n(the i5-10300H version) about a week ago, and am looking to upgrade the memory\nto 16GB (or more depending on RAM prices). i am noticing that 2666MHz or\n3200MHz seem to be more available, and sometimes cheaper, than 2933MHz. if the\nprice is better, should i buy the 3200MHz, or the 2666MHz?\n\nfor reference, here\u2019s what i see on amazon.ca for HyperX Impact: 32GB 2666MHz,\nCL16 = $154.99 CAD 2933MHz, CL17 = $210.39 CAD 3200MHz, CL20 = $234.99 CAD\n\n16GB 2666MHz, CL15 = $79.99 CAD 2933MHz, CL17 = $134.74 CAD 3200MHz, CL20 =\n$119.99 CAD\n\n8GB 2666MHz, CL16 = $36.99 CAD 2933MHz, CL17 = $76.81 CAD 3200MHz, CL20 =\n$64.99 CAD\n\nReply\n\n     * Brendan\n\nSeptember 9, 2020 at 5:01 pm\n\nHi,\n\nI actually put the HyperX Impact 32GB 2933MHz stick in my Vostro 7500, but it\nonly ran at 2666MHz. I am unsure if the 2666MHz will work at 2666MHz, run at a\nslower speed, or not at all. Likewise the 3200MHz stick might run at 2933MHz,\n2666MHz, or might not run at all. (The system won\u2019t run above 2933MHz so\n3200MHz will be overkill regardless.) The challenge with me using RAM above\nthe specified supported amounts is there isn\u2019t any support or guarantee of\ncompatibility, so I don\u2019t know if the downclocking of my HyperX Impact was\nbecause of the RAM volume or RAM itself. I\u2019d probably look for a seller with a\ngenerous return policy over anything else so you don\u2019t end up footing a bill\nfor RAM that doesn\u2019t work. I\u2019d look for reviews for RAM where people say it\nworked well in a Dell XPS or Dell Inspiron, as chances are those sticks will\nwork well in a Vostro too.\n\nReply\n\n  2. 0xD6\n\nOctober 29, 2020 at 9:30 am\n\nWill this work on an XPS 99570 with latest BIOS (1.17.1, after plundervolt\n\u201cfixes\u201d) and with CPU microcode 0xD6? Are the strings to look for (CFG and\nOverclocking lock) or are they different? Thanks in advance. Sadly i couldn\u2019t\ndo like other people that just reset their BIOS settings or downgraded and got\nto undervolt. Mine is still locked.\n\nReply\n\n  3.

Followed exaclty all your\nsteps, everything seemed to be working fine. booted the USB and changed the\nvalues to 0x0, read the values and indeed it showed me the offset was changed\nsuccesfully. However, when booting windows back up again, after going back to\nfactory BIOS values, still no offset change possible in XTU and in\nThrottlestop. Any ideas what i could do to fix it?\n\nKind regards\n\nReply\n\n     * Vincent\n\nAugust 12, 2021 at 3:31 am\n\nYea it\u2019s not working on mine either. I have the same spec, XPS 9500 i7-10750H.\n\nI am certain the flags value are changed accordingly, but when adjusting the\nvoltage offset in ThrottleStop FIVR, the offset value remain at constant\n0.000. I am suspecting a later XPS 9500 model may have some sort of hardware\nlock? I am not sure.\n\nReply\n\n  5.

What worked great for me with gaming is setting the Turbo\nboost at 36 for all cores, and undervolting by -0.75.

Very detailed guide but I\u2019m not already trying it out cus I\u2019m kind of a\nnoob of this stuff and I wanted to know first if I need to downgrade my bios\nand at which version (current 1.19.1). I have an XPS 9570 (i7 8750h) and\nrecently I cannot run games smoothly anymore like I was used before so I tried\nsome workaround and the best solution without undervolt is to set the power to\n\u201ccool\u201d(inside dell power manager) so the CPU runs slower and the games run...\nI guessed is a thermal throttling issue, so when I tried undervolt with\nthrottlestop or XTU I noticed the voltage lock and here I am to understand how\nto fix this out.\n\nIn TS I tried different comibinations of settings and with the TPL very low\n(max 10 min 10) my cpu runs between 0.8 and 1.4 GHz (...very low) but i can\nplay AC Odyssey at 35 FPS average...

At first sight it worked well, I was able to change the\nvariables for overclocking and CFG. However, the overclocking value only stays\nfor one boot after changing. So basically I boot into EFI -> change value ->\nreboot -> undervolting is working -> reboot -> undervolting is locked again,\nthe value is set to 0x1 again. CFG seems to stay at 0x0.

Easy to follow and excellent info.\nUnfortunately, I\u2019m having the same issue as Angelos and Winfred. On my Dell\nXPS 9560, BIOS rev 1.22.1, I\u2019m able to get the modifier unlocked and change\nvoltages as described. However, after a second reboot, the EFI change to the\nOverclock variable is reset and the Unlock option is again grayed out. The CFG\nis still at 0x0. Just guessing here, but this EFI edit might not actually be\naffecting the ROM at all. I have no idea how to make this change persist, but\nif I find something I\u2019ll post it here.\n\nReply\n\n     * Brendan\n\nJuly 15, 2021 at 11:53 pm\n\nHey, I actually had my ability to undervolt revert this week too! It turns out\nWindows Update automatically upgraded my Dell Firmware (including my BIOS) to\n1.8.0 which seemed to undo the changes I made via the EFI tool. Seems like a\nlot of Dell models had BIOS updates rolled out in the last week or two this\nway, which might explain why some people lost their ability to undervolt after\na recent power cycle. Repeating the steps in the post may bring the\nundervolting back for some BIOSes, but I wonder if Dell updated some systems\nin a way that prevents this kind of tweak from persisting. I reapplied the\nedit to my own BIOS and it has survived two power cycles so far, but I\u2019ll keep\nan eye on it to see if it goes away again.\n\nShould be able to prevent automatic BIOS updates from undoing your undervolt\nability via steps outlined here:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Dell/comments/8543gj/psa_set_bios_to_disable_uefi_firmware_updates_to/\n\nI added a new step in the blog post for users who prefer undervolting to Dell\nBIOS upgrades, hope it helps\n\nReply\n\n     * Stephen Harper\n\nJune 23, 2022 at 3:51 am\n\nThanks for the write up, Brendan.\n\nI find myself in the same situation as Owen here.

Thank you so much for taking the time to write this\nup. I have a Dell XPS 9560, BIOS is v 1.23.1 (latest release). Thanks to your\nexcellent guide, I have my undervolt back! My variables were a little\ndifferent than yours and some of the others, so I thought I\u2019d post the\ncommands I use here.\n\nsetup_var Setup 0x4ED 0x00 (this one actually seems to persist through\nreboots, could actually omit it) setup_var Setup 0x59C 0x00\n\nNote that on yours, the VarStore name is CpuSetup, but on mine it is just\nSetup. Also, my system expects a longer hex value, so there are two zeroes.\n0x0 works, but it complains about it.\n\nReply\n\n     * Stephen\n\nJune 23, 2022 at 3:56 am\n\nSame values here for XPS 15 9560 with BIOS 1.24.0.\n\nOverclocking variable 0x59C is reset between reboots. Would be great if\nsomeone can share if they have the same model of laptop and got it to stick,\nand what BIOS version they have.\n\nThanks!\n\nReply\n\n  39.

I just really wonder once you were able to unlock TS on your Dell\nG7 with i7 8750H. Since I even broken my mind with almost few last weeks\nresearching any working solution for me. I have Dell Alienware 17R5 and BIOS\n1.11.0 from 2020/08/26 and I even tried Overclocking lock with my var Store\n0x5BE and CGF Lock 0x65A, sorry if re-arrange them, but the values are totally\nprecise according IFR extract from my BIOS Dump. So actually the GNU GRUB\n2.06, final one ver I have changed the Varstore from default 0x1 to 0x0 and\ndisabled both CGF lock and Overclocking lock. Yes, in BIOS Intel VT-d is OFF,\nSecure Boot is diasbled (Off), TPM Secure Capsule is disabled in Windows Core\nIsolation is disabled and Intel Virtualization too in Registry, double check.\nI have Win 10 22H2. So I really sad about the unability to change the game for\ndisabling CGF lock and Overclocking lock for My Alienware 17R5 .\n\nAs I wonder I have Dell 7210, my second family one laptop and it has i5 10310\nCPU and the instruction from Brendan is pretty flawless working for in with\n10th GEN.\n\nBut with the 8th GEN it is hell!!! Crazy stuff.\n\nTried to Downgrade my BIOS from 1.11.0 to 1.8.1 or to 1.7.0 but Dell has\nremover Recovery Image from official Website, ba****ds!!! I guess just to\navoid any unexpected warranty issues from this trick, as they think, I guess..\nAnd no way to find them especially for certain BIOS versions.\n\nClemente, can you just assist me with you recipe for retriving Undervolting\nfor your Dell G7 with similar i7 8750H as I have. I guess the method should be\npretty similar.\n\nWill be so appreciate any assistance from you!!!\n\nKind regards, Anton.\n\nReply\n\n  40.

I bought the Vostro 7500 a couple of months ago when I\nenrolled in a GIS training class and found out that in all practicality, the\napplication needed a PC with a discrete graphics card. Dell was running a\nspecial on the 7500 so I got it ... before I read about all the thermal issues\nwith this model. I thought that my seven-year old HP Elitebook ran hot, but\neven under full load that machine never went above 80C.\n\nRight out of the box, I saw from HWMonitor that the 7500 would regularly hit\n100C, even if the nominal temps were more in the 45C to 55C range. I started\nparing down the startup services and that helped a little bit. That\u2019s when I\nfound this page.\n\nI tried the registry hack to get the expanded power settings, but that didn\u2019t\nwork. For one thing, I did not find a CSEnabled setting in that folder\nlocation.\n\nThe settings on Throttlestop though worked great. Disabling the Turbo boost,\nchanging the SpeedStep setting, and setting the temp offset to 10C made all\nthe difference. Now, the 7500 rarely goes over 60C during normal usage. The\nnominal temps are about the same, but I no longer see the temps going into\nthose high peaks or feeling the keyboard getting as hot when some background\nprocesses get going.\n\nAnd it still works fine with demanding GIS applications.\n\nI don\u2019t use my laptop for gaming, but I do work with the lid closed and the\nlaptop connected to a USB dock. So, those seeing the temps regularly peaking\nat 100C was worrisome. This guide helped a lot. Maybe one day I\u2019ll get around\nthe tackling the undervolting hacks, but the tips I\u2019ve used so far have worked\ngreat. Thanks!\n\nReply\n\n  43.

Uncheck UEFI firmware capsule updates\nin your current bios under the security section 3. Download and run this as an\nadministrator ( https://github.com/Brad331/NoDPTF ) 4. Download your system\nbios that were released before December 2019 5. Downgrade bios to the old\nversion 6. Reboot the system before windows boot Repeat steps (1 & 2) 7.

Alberto\n\nDecember 5, 2023 at 11:26 am\n\nHi Brendan, first of all thanks for the guide! I\u2019ve noticed the link to win-\nraid being broken, but with some googling I found a current version:\nhttps://winraid.level1techs.com/t/intel-converged-security-management-engine-\ndrivers-firmware-and-tools-2-15/30719\n\nIt seems to be for nothing though. It seems Intel/Dell has now completely\nremoved the option to undervolt, at least for my XPS 9500. I have followed\nyour guide, which led to FVIR being unlocked in Throttlestop, but changing the\noffset has absolutely no effect on the system anymore. I could bring it down\nto -1000, and nothing changed. Some googling showed that Dell/Intel patched\nsomething on a very low level the past months, which completely disregards any\nundervolting.\n\nWhich means my XPS is completely useless. Honestly worst piece of technology\nI\u2019ve ever owned. My advice to all others: Don\u2019t bother, save yourself the\nheadaches and sell it.\n\nReply\n\n  75.

Don\u2019t know\nwhich revision, but it\u2019s got an i7-9750H in it and uses the older case with a\nsilver/black look. Also has RAM that\u2019s not soldered to the mobo and is\ntherefore upgrade-able more easily.\n\nAnyway, I can\u2019t seem to load the site linked for getting the Intel ME System\nTools (the link goes to win-raid.com). Just keeps timing out for me. Does\nanyone know of another reputable source?\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
