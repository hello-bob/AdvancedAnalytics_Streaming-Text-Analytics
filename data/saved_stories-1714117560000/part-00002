The idea\nhere is to be realistic while telling people what you need from them.\n\nIt does not mean that you should not strive for excellence or set high\nstandards and expectations.\n\n##### It merely means that you should consider the reality of things and the\ncontext in which you are.\n\nMany people fail this process by setting blurred and unrealistic goals, which\nend in disappointment.\n\nWhen the objective is unclear, it is much easier to have unrealistic\nexpectations because you end up telling yourself what you wish to happen\nwithout actually clarifying what it is.\n\n### Know When to Say What\n\nThe key is to set expectations at the beginning and not wait till the end of\nthe process.\n\nIn a corporate setting, let your co-workers know what results you are looking\nfor and how long it should take. Then make sure they understand precisely what\nyou're expecting from them.\n\nIf there is more than one issue or concern, break the situation down into an\nactionable plan that covers everything that needs to be addressed. Be\narticulate and communicate as much as possible to avoid surprises and the\nunrealistic expectations trap.\n\n### Set Clear Objectives And Priorities\n\nGoal setting is key here. Even though it is a good idea to set high\nexpectations, it goes without saying that expectation management also includes\nsetting priorities in order to get a certain outcome.\n\nWe should avoid double duties and ensure that tasks are clear, concise, and\nadd up to be mutually supported.\n\n##### The focus here is to set outcomes, boundaries, and key deliverables.\n\nWhen working in a team, for instance, each team member should have a sense of\nwhat success looks like and how the whole team fits into that future goal.\n\nHaving high expectations for your organization does not have to lead to a\nculture of stress or anxiety. By embracing realistic goals and improving\ntransparency about the true capabilities of the team, you can set your\nemployees up for success.\n\n### Provide Measurable Goals\n\nTo Manage expectations doesn't mean sugarcoating reality \u2014 it means being\ntruthful while also providing context that allows others to prepare for the\ntime ahead.\n\nThe key to managing expectations, whether on a personal or professional level,\nis to set goals that are challenging but not out of reach.\n\nStart with small goals and make steady progress toward them. This will keep\nyou or others motivated and build confidence over time.\n\nIf there are any details or decisions that need to be made upfront, get it all\nagreed upon before moving forward.\n\nThis makes sure both of you are speaking the same language as far as\nexpectations go and will keep both parties happy when the work is completed\nand delivered.\n\n### Manage What Is In Your Control\n\nWhen it comes to managing expectations, a great leader also has to keep in\nmind that not everyone is like them. Everyone may want success, but they do\nnot all define success in the same way or have the same expectations. Given\nthese differences, only effective communication will get you what you desire\nand need from others.\n\nIn reality, you do not have power over what the outcome will actually be; the\nbest thing you can do in the present is to align their expectations with your\noutcomes.\n\n##### Ask them to say what you want in their own words.\n\nBe honest when setting expectations. Avoiding the truth will only make people\nfeel like they can't trust you and may result in them not doing business with\nyou again in the future.\n\nBe sure to explain everything that is going on in detail so that there are no\nquestions left unanswered about what is happening or what needs to happen\nnext.\n\nWith regards to a client, address any concerns they may have once they\nunderstand what is going on. If they have a concern or question, address it\nimmediately so that any misunderstandings can be cleared up before moving\nforward with the project. Remember to follow up after the project has been\ncompleted to ensure that everything went according to plan and that they are\nhappy with the outcome.\n\n### Check Progress Regularly\n\nExpectation management is not just setting the right expectation and leaving\neverything until the end and hoping everything would go as expected. You need\nto constantly monitor by following up with the relevant stakeholders.\n\nWhen you find yourself disappointed in the performance, the person\nunderperforming may have one of four things wrong.\n\n1) They have the wrong expectations about the task.\n\n2) They do not know what success looks like for the task.\n\n3) The leader has not managed their limitations and provided them with an\nopportunity to succeed.\n\n4) You have assigned either too much or too little for that individual and now\nthey are lost.\n\n### Confidence in Self-Efficacy\n\nit is hard to manage expectations if you don't know what to expect yourself.\n\nYou have to convince others of your vision, setting the tone for a successful\nrelationship that can be built around expectations management.\n\nLet's take the example of setting up an effective training program for a team.\nYour employees need to trust that you know what you are doing and that you\ncare about their development.\n\nThe best way to do so is by building up confidence in self-efficacy. Getting\npeople involved in achieving results creates high levels of self-efficacy.\n\n## The Consequences of Expectations Misalignment\n\nOne of the biggest problems with not managing expectations is that it causes\nperformance decline.\n\nThe core issue with not managing expectations lies in the fact that you set\nyour employees up for failure.\n\nDrastically underestimating the amount of time it takes to complete tasks or\nprojects makes employees feel like they need to put in an extra effort merely\nto get by.\n\nWhen there is a significant mismatch in expectation and perceived performance,\nthe result may be a negative feeling. This can lead to employee\ndissatisfaction and high turnover.\n\nThey often go on overworking themselves and deliver a poor outcomes.\n\nExpectations can also cause people to complete tasks faster and more\naccurately if those expectations match their perceived level of skill.\n\nWhen you set expectations, and the other party is confident about their\nability to meet the requirement, they are more likely to hold up to your\nexplications.\n\nManaging expectations is a two-way street. Both the leader and the employee\nneed to create an environment that enables the individual to fulfill his/her\nrole. And it needs to be a positive experience for all concerned.\n\nLeaders who are not forthcoming about their expectations or set arbitrary or\nunrealistic ones are likely to find themselves constantly dealing with\nemployee complaints about feeling unappreciated, misunderstood, or\nundervalued.\n\n> It does mean you should feel guilty setting your own expectations, whatever\n> high they might be, but they should not be unrealistic.\n\nEmployees who are not forthcoming with their needs and concerns will soon find\nthemselves out of sync with the business, their productivity suffers, and\ntheir relationships with their managers will deteriorate.\n\nIt's important to be clear upfront about what both parties expect from each\nother. For example, is the employee expected to...\n\n...work a set number of hours? ...be available on an \"on-call\" basis? ...have\na minimum of relevant experience? ...meet certain performance objectives?\n...accommodate flexible start times? ...be willing to travel at short notice?\n\n> Good to Know: Writing is shown to improve exam is performance when students\n> write their expectations before the exam.\n\nA person's expectations have a significant effect on what they actually\nexperience. Expectations are important because they influence the extent to\nwhich people approach an activity with a positive or negative attitude, which\naffects their performance.\n\nOver a decade, the Pygmalion effect, well-known in social psychology, has been\ndocumented in many studies, including Rosenthal's study of a nursery school\nwhere teachers were told that some of the children were intellectual\n\"prodigies\" and would bloom intellectually much earlier than average.\n\nAs a result, Rosenthal found that the children designated as \"prodigies\" did\nindeed perform better.\n\nSimilarly, elementary school teachers who expect their students to be\ndifficult or to misbehave tend to elicit negative behavior from those\nstudents.\n\nBut when teachers expect good behavior from their students, those students\ntend to behave better. Another study showed how important expectations are\nwhen it comes to evaluating job performance.\n\nEvaluators who were told that an employee had performed poorly judged that\nemployee more harshly than evaluators who were told the same employee had\nperformed well.\n\nExpectations also play an important role in the initial phase of romantic\nrelationships. Research has shown that early in relationships, couples tend to\nbe overly optimistic about one another and are more likely to idealize their\npartners' qualities.\n\n## Key Take-Aways To Effectively Manage Expectations\n\nTakeaway 1: Managing expectations is an ongoing process that involves you\nconsistently monitoring and communicating what is expected in a situation.\n\nTakeaway 2: Measurable goals are important, but they only work with regular\ncommunication. You should also set up systems to measure qualitative\nbenchmarks, deadlines, etc.\n\nTakeaway 3: Consider four modes for managing expectations. 1. Align behaviours\nand strategies to their expectations 2. Encourage internalized accountability\n\u2013 help employees to align their behaviours and strategies with their\ncollective expectations 3. Eliminate destructive external control \u2013 eliminate\nunnecessary or unfair scapegoating and remove others' excessive control over\nemployees' actions and decisions 4. Seek high levels of transparency through\ncontinuous feedback and dissemination of information \u2013 to achieve an optimal\nlevel of expectation management\n\nAll in all, the most important aspect of managing expectations is being\ntransparent with people from the very beginning. Don't over-promise and under-\ndeliver, and they won't do the same because this can cause major damage to\nyour credibility and ultimately make your job much harder as a leader.\n\nFollow on LinkedIn\n\nTagged in:\n\nsociety\n\nSubscribe to our email newsletter and unlock access to members-only content\nand exclusive updates.\n\n### About the Author\n\n#### Adamou Boubacar Amadou\n\nCloud\n\nI write content at the intersection of Marketing, Growth and Technology to\nhelp you learn while I do the same.\n\nView All Articles\n\n#### Check latest articles from this author:\n\n1\n\n#### What You Need to Know about Horizontal Marketing Systems\n\nApr 28, 2023\n\n2\n\n#### The Power of Writing and Reading: Conversations with the Dead, Time\nCompression, and AI\n\nFeb 28, 2023\n\n3\n\n#### Knowing the Difference between Strategy and Tactics\n\nFeb 17, 2023\n\n### Comments\n\n### Related Articles\n\n1\n\n#### The Future of Education: How Technology is Transforming the Classroom\n\nMar 17, 2023\n\n2 min read\n\n2\n\n#### The Power of Writing and Reading: Conversations with the Dead, Time\nCompression, and AI\n\nFeb 28, 2023\n\n7 min read\n\n3\n\n#### How to Respond to a Compliment: Tips and Strategies for Accepting\nCompliments Graciously and Positively\n\nDec 4, 2022\n\n3 min read\n\n4\n\n#### Beware of WhatsApp Scams: How to Protect Yourself from Fraud and Scams on\nWhatsApp\n\nDec 4, 2022\n\n3 min read\n\n#### About Me\n\n#### Adamou Boubacar Amadou\n\nCloud\n\nI write content at the intersection of Marketing, Growth and Technology to\nhelp you learn while I do the same.\n\n#### Featured Articles\n\n1\n\n#### How Does a Lean Startup Improve its Marketing Strategy?\n\nAug 25, 2023\n\n2\n\n#### The Power of Writing and Reading: Conversations with the Dead, Time\nCompression, and AI\n\nFeb 28, 2023\n\n3\n\n#### ChatGPT, Character.ai, and Adept.ai: Leading the Way in AI Innovation\n\nDec 13, 2022\n\n#### Follow Me!\n\nFacebook Twitter RSS\n\n#### Tag Cloud\n\nBusiness marketing society technology\n\n#### Previous Article\n\nsociety\n\n#### Digital Transformation Initiatives: Unlocking the Potential of Public-\nPrivate Partnerships in the Fourth Industrial Revolution\n\nJan 1, 2022\n\n4 min read\n\n#### Next Article\n\nBusiness\n\n#### Should You Always Focus On Quality Over Quantity?\n\nJan 21, 2022\n\n5 min read\n\nInsighteurs is an online magazine centered on the confluence of business,\ntechnology and society.
