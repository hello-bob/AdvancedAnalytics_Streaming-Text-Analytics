He dives into some interesting examples of malicious code from\nrecent software supply chain attacks.\n\n## What is the Supply Chain?#\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon to see applications where 90% of the code comes from open\nsource dependencies, most of which are not written in house. The average open\nsource dependency has 79 transitive dependencies attached to it.\n\n\u201cIn this world where your application is built on thousands of dependencies,\nsoftware security is not just about your code \u2014 it's about every piece of code\nthat you depend on,\u201d Feross said.\n\n\"Fundamentally, the problem here is that we're using so many packages but we\njust don't have the time to read every line of code in our dependencies.\"\n\nSoftware supply chains include all of this third-party code, APIs, cloud\nservices, and even dependencies like your operating system.\n\n## Open Source Supply Chains Are Under Attack#\n\n\"As developers, we\u2019re always trusting other people,\u201d Feross said. \u201cOpen source\nis built on trust, and for the most part, this trust is well-placed.\" There\nare a few bad actors who abuse public registries by releasing malicious\npackages or hijacking legitimate ones.\n\nAccording to a research paper published in 2021, it was previously taking over\n200 days for the security community to detect a malicious package. Socket now\nhas the ability to catch these attempts often minutes after they are published\nto the public registries. We\u2019re detecting and blocking over 100 of these types\nof attacks every week.\n\nFeross explained that even after these malicious packages are reported and\ntaken down, they\u2019re often not cataloged or saved in any way. They don\u2019t go\ninto the typical vulnerability tracking systems like the NVD - they just get\ntaken down and then developers don\u2019t know whether or not they may have\ninstalled that package in the past. This is something we\u2019re trying to change\nat Socket.\n\nIn this talk, Feross breaks down a few examples of malicious code in supply\nchain attacks we have seen recently.
