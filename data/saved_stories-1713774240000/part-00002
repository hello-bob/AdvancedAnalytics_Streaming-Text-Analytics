Ramsey and Federal Bureau of Investigation\n(FBI) Special Agent in Charge Robert K. Tripp. The sentence was handed down by\nthe Hon. Charles R. Breyer, Senior United States District Judge.\n\nLachwani, 47, of Los Altos, California, pleaded guilty on April 23, 2023, to\ntwo counts of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, and one count of\nsecurities fraud, in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78j(b) and 78ff and 17 C.F.R. \u00a7\n240.10b-5. He had been charged in a superseding indictment in August 2022 with\nwire fraud, securities fraud, and money laundering.\n\nAccording to his plea agreement, Lachwani founded HeadSpin, Inc. in 2015 and\nserved as its Chief Executive Officer until May 2020. Among other things,\nHeadSpin provided clients with software tools and access to remote devices to\ntest mobile applications. Between April 2017 and April 2020, HeadSpin raised\nmore than $100 million from investors. But Lachwani admitted that, to obtain\nthat financing, he provided potential investors with information about the\ncompany\u2019s business, customers, revenue, and finances that he knew was\ninaccurate.\n\nFor example, Lachwani admitted he sent potential investors financial\ninformation that he knew overstated HeadSpin\u2019s revenue and annual recurring\nrevenue (ARR), which is a measure of a company\u2019s subscription revenue rate at\na particular point in time, annualized to show revenue the company would\nexpect to make, at that rate, over the course of a full year. Specifically, he\nadmitted he knew the revenue and ARR figures he provided to investors were\noverstated because they included amounts from potential customers that had not\nagreed to pay subscription fees to HeadSpin, amounts that were more than real\ncustomers had agreed to pay, and amounts from customers that had stopped using\nand paying for HeadSpin\u2019s services.\n\nLachwani also admitted that he knowingly sent HeadSpin\u2019s accountant false\ninformation about customer contracts that was incorporated into HeadSpin\u2019s\nfinancial statements, as well as invoices that he knew had been altered to\nshow amounts that had not actually been invoiced to clients.\n\n\u201cThis defendant admitted he lied about his company\u2019s revenue and customers to\nattract funding from investors, including many in Silicon Valley,\u201d said United\nStates Attorney Ismail J. Ramsey. \u201cToday\u2019s sentencing should send a message to\nother entrepreneurs who may be tempted to cross the line into fraud and to\n\u2018fake it until they make it.\u2019 This Office is committed to protecting\ninvestors\u2014including those whose capital powers the engines of innovation in\nSilicon Valley\u2014from start-ups that misrepresent their finances and try to cut\ncorners.\u201d\n\nIn addition to sentencing Lachwani to prison, Judge Breyer ordered the\ndefendant to serve three years of supervised release to begin after his prison\nterm is completed. Judge Breyer also ordered Lachwani to pay a $1 million fine\nand scheduled a hearing for July 31, 2024, to address the issue of\nrestitution.\n\nThe case is being prosecuted by the Corporate and Securities Fraud Section of\nthe United States Attorney\u2019s Office. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Lloyd Farnham\nand Noah Stern are prosecuting the case with assistance from Aarian Beiti. The\nprosecution is the result of an investigation by the FBI. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s\nOffice and the FBI thank the San Francisco Regional Office of the Securities\nand Exchange Commission (SEC). An SEC civil enforcement action is currently\npending against Lachwani in the Northern District of California.\n\nUpdated April 19, 2024\n\nComponent\n\nUSAO - California, Northern\n\n## Related Content\n\nPress Release\n\nVallejo Resident Sentenced To 10 Years In Prison For Possession Of Child\nPornography\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2013 Jose Navarro Mendoza has been sentenced to 120 months in\nprison following his conviction for possession of child pornography, announced\nUnited States Attorney Ismail J.
