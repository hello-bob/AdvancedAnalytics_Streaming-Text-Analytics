Armon Dadgar, co-founder and\nCTO of HashiCorp, said that by joining IBM, it will be able to offer its\nproducts to a much wider audience.\n\n\u201cWhile we are more than a decade into HashiCorp, we believe we are still in\nthe early stages of cloud adoption. With IBM, we have the opportunity to help\nmore customers get there faster, to accelerate our product innovation, and to\ncontinue to grow our practitioner community,\u201d Dadgar wrote.\n\nDave McJannet, CEO of HashiCorp, added: \u201cIBM\u2019s leadership in hybrid cloud\nalong with its rich history of innovation, make it the ideal home for\nHashiCorp as we enter the next phase of our growth journey. I\u2019m proud of the\nwork we\u2019ve done as a standalone company, I am excited to be able to help our\ncustomers further, and I look forward to the future of HashiCorp as part of\nIBM.\u201d\n\nKris Beevers, co-founder and CEO of NetBox Labs, believes that with this\nacquisition IBM is trying to consolidate ownership of two of the most popular\nopen source IT automation tools: Red Hat Ansible (acquired in 2019) and now\nHashiCorp Terraform.\n\n\u201cIn network management and automation specifically, Ansible and Terraform\ndominate the ecosystem and are widely deployed by practitioners,\u201d said\nBeevers. \u201cThis move will make IBM an open source IT automation powerhouse. I\nexpect the consolidation of these tools under the IBM umbrella might result in\nmore whitespace for new open source automation tools over time, but in the\nnear term it will simplify the ecosystem and accelerate vendor and open source\nintegrations with Ansible and Terraform, which will simplify and accelerate\nenterprise IT and network automation initiatives.\u201d\n\nThough widely used, Terraform hasn\u2019t had a perfect year, after last August\nwhen HashiCorp announced that Terraform would switch from the Mozilla Public\nLicense 2.0 to the Business Source Licenses for its future releases. In\nresponse, the Terraform community created an open fork of Terraform, called\nOpenTofu.\n\nWhen the change was first announced, the OpenTofu community wrote the OpenTofu\nManifesto, stating \u201dIn our opinion, this change threatens the entire community\nand ecosystem that\u2019s built up around Terraform over the last 9 years.\u201d\n\nThen earlier this month OpenTofu received a cease and desist from HashiCorp\nbecause of copyright claims, and OpenTofu has denied those claims. The cease\nand desist claimed that OpenTofu copied code that was under the BSL, however\nOpenTofu denied this, offering the explanation that both HashiCorp and\nOpenTofu copied the code from the MPL v2.0 version.\n\n\u201cHashiCorp has made claims of copyright infringement in a cease & desist\nletter. These claims are completely unsubstantiated. The code in question can\nbe clearly shown to have been copied from older code under the MPL-2.0\nlicense. HashiCorp seems to have copied the same code itself when they\nimplemented their version of this feature,\u201d OpenTofu wrote in a response.\n\ndtSearch\u00ae - INSTANTLY SEARCH TERABYTES\n\nin files, emails, databases, web data.
