The\nresults have been, at best, mixed. Of course, the EU government claims it\u2019s\nnot actually interested in breaking encryption. Instead, it hides its\nintentions behind phrases like \u201cclient-side scanning\u201d and \u201cchat control.\u201d But\nit all just means the same thing: purposefully weakening or breaking\nencryption to allow the government to monitor communications.\n\nClient-side scanning would necessitate the removal of one end of end-to-end\nencryption. Monitoring communications for \u201cchat control\u201d would mean the same\nthing. Fortunately, plenty of EU members disagreed with these proposals,\nfinally forcing the EU Commission to drop its anti-encryption demands... for\nnow.\n\nAs the EU government moves on from its failed proposal, it\u2019s undergoing the\nusual stages of grief. First and foremost is denial \u2014 something often\nexpressed in op-eds and formal statements that are short on facts or logic,\nbut long on strawmen and cognitive dissonance.\n\nBut there\u2019s still a desire to undermine encryption \u2014 one that simply won\u2019t go\naway just because several EU members nations are against it. And here\u2019s where\nthe cops have decided to insert themselves, even though most EU citizens\ncouldn\u2019t care less about law enforcement\u2019s thoughts on policy issues. I mean,\nthey\u2019re always the same sort of thing: less accountability, more power, fewer\nrights for citizens, etc.\n\nUnfortunately, the ruling class tends to listen to cops because cops are part\nof the conjoined triangles (or whatever) that ensures people in power retain\ntheir power while being protected from the people being ruled. What works for\ncops works for the rest of the government, and that\u2019s why this statement\ncarries some weight, even if it\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you\u2019d expect to\nroll out of a cop\u2019s mouth.\n\nThis statement [PDF], released by the European Police Chiefs, has been\nprompted by Meta\u2019s rollout of end-to-end encryption for its Facebook Messenger\nservice.\n\n> European Police Chiefs are calling for industry and governments to take\n> urgent action to ensure public safety across social media platforms.\n>\n> Privacy measures currently being rolled out, such as end-to-end encryption,\n> will stop tech companies from seeing any offending that occurs on their\n> platforms. It will also stop law enforcement\u2019s ability to obtain and use\n> this evidence in investigations to prevent and prosecute the most serious\n> crimes such as child sexual abuse, human trafficking, drug smuggling,\n> homicides, economic crime and terrorism offences.\n>\n> The declaration, published today and supported by Europol and the European\n> Police Chiefs, comes as end-to-end encryption has started to be rolled out\n> across Meta\u2019s messenger platform.\n\nWell, ensuring public safety often takes the form of securing people\u2019s private\ncommunications, i.e., the end-to-end encryption this formal statement rails\nagainst. I\u2019m sure the EU police chiefs and the people who work for them\nappreciate the security enabled by encryption, whether its protecting their\ndevices from the curiosity of interlopers or shielding their communications\nfrom public view.\n\nBut what works best for cops can\u2019t be extended to the general public because,\nunlike cops shops, the public is known to be riddled with criminals. (Yes, I\nknow. But I\u2019m trying my best to explain this from the perspective of law\nenforcement officials, who would never admit they\u2019re not doing much to keep\ntheir own backyards clean, so to speak.)\n\nThe letter opens with an admission by the collective of police chiefs that\nthey\u2019re unable to do their jobs unless tech companies do half the work for\nthem.\n\n> We, the European Police Chiefs, recognise that law enforcement and the\n> technology industry have a shared duty to keep the public safe, especially\n> children. We have a proud partnership of complementary actions towards that\n> end. That partnership is at risk.\n>\n> Two key capabilities are crucial to supporting online safety.\n>\n> First, the ability of technology companies to reactively provide to law\n> enforcement investigations \u2013 on the basis of a lawful authority with strong\n> safeguards and oversight \u2013 the data of suspected criminals on their service.\n> This is known as \u2018lawful access\u2019.\n\nWe\u2019ll pause here for a moment because Europol has already given us plenty to\nwork with. First, there\u2019s the invocation of the \u201cchildren,\u201d which is always a\nleading indicator of disingenuous arguments. If you\u2019re say you\u2019re doing it for\nthe kids, you can get all kinds of irrational because who in their right mind\nwould argue against someone who claims to be deeply interested in protecting\nchildren from criminals?\n\nThen there\u2019s the phrase \u201clawful access,\u201d which means nothing more than cops\nbelieve they should have access to any potential evidence just because they\nhave a warrant. This supposed hole in law enforcement efficiency is blamed on\nthe advent of encryption, even though criminals have been destroying or hiding\nevidence for years but no law enforcement official ever sent out a statement\ndemanding the manufacturers of fire pits, paper shredders, or bridges over\nbodies of water stop making it so easy for criminals to hide evidence from\ninvestigators.\n\nMoving on, there\u2019s more of the same stuff for a couple of paragraphs. It\u2019s the\npolice chiefs griping that evidence is now suddenly out of reach and that\u2019s\nbecause tech companies won\u2019t create encryption backdoors or just refuse to\ndeploy encryption in the first place. More is said about crimes against\nchildren, terrorism, human trafficking, drug smuggling, and (LOL) \u201ceconomic\ncrime,\u201d the last of which is something no government body is truly serious\nabout because it would require prosecuting people who give them massive\namounts of money in exchange for government goods and services. If you\u2019ve\nheard these arguments once, you\u2019ve heard them a thousand times. We won\u2019t\nrehash them here.\n\nBut we will quote the statement again because it goes back to the \u201cwe\u2019ve never\nhad trouble obtaining evidence before this exact point in time\u201d well, even\nthough that\u2019s clearly false.\n\n> Our societies have not previously tolerated spaces that are beyond the reach\n> of law enforcement, where criminals can communicate safely and child abuse\n> can flourish. They should not now. We cannot let ourselves be blinded to\n> crime. We know from the protections afforded by the darkweb how rapidly and\n> extensively criminals exploit such anonymity.\n\nOK, chief. I don\u2019t remember any mobs (flash or pitchfork-wielding) wandering\ninto neighborhoods to destroy fireplaces, paper shredders, or toilets because\nthose areas might be \u201cbeyond the reach of law enforcement\u201d when it comes to\nensuring evidence is always accessible to investigators. And they\u2019ve never\ntaken down phone lines or slashed postal vehicles\u2019 tires just because\ncriminals might use those methods to \u201ccommunicate safely.\u201d\n\nOur societies have always understood criminals will have options, some of\nwhich are beyond the reach of law enforcement. They don\u2019t want to see those\noptions destroyed or undermined just because criminals also happen to use the\nsame options non-criminals use.\n\nThen there\u2019s the unneeded swipe at \u201canonymity,\u201d which suggests Europol\u2019s top\ncops think online anonymity is problematic in and of itself \u2014 even the stuff\nthat exists out in the open away from the depths of the \u201cdark web.\u201d\n\nFinally, the cops of Europe reach the \u201cnerd harder\u201d point of their message \u2014\none that claims to be conciliatory but is anything but:\n\n> We are committed to supporting the development of critical innovations, such\n> as encryption, as a means of strengthening the cyber security and privacy of\n> citizens. However, we do not accept that there need be a binary choice\n> between cyber security or privacy on the one hand and public safety on the\n> other. Absolutism on either side is not helpful. Our view is that technical\n> solutions do exist; they simply require flexibility from industry as well as\n> from governments.\n\nWhenever government entities pushing new forms of intrusion start talking\nabout \u201cflexibility,\u201d that trait should only apply to those on the receiving\nend of the imposition. Governments will never back down. It\u2019s always the other\nside that\u2019s expected to compromise their standards and ethics.\n\nThis statement isn\u2019t going to budge the needle for Meta or others offering the\nsame level of security for their users. But it may light a small fire under\nthe asses of enemies of encryption in the European government. And that\u2019s the\nreal danger of this collection of clich\u00e9s presenting itself as a principled\nstance on the issue.\n\nFiled Under: backdoors, encryption, eu, european police chiefs, police, public\nsafety\n\n5 CommentsLeave a Comment\n\nIf you liked this post, you may also be interested in...\n\n  * 'Lol, No' Is The Perfect Response To LAPD's Nonsense 'IP' Threat Letter Over 'Fuck The LAPD' Shirt\n  * The Story Behind The XZ Backdoor Is Way More Fascinating Than It Should Be\n  * Ctrl-Alt-Speech: Are Platforms Ready For Elections?\n  * New Jersey Sued Again For Giving Cops Access To Newborn Babies' DNA\n  * California HOAs Are Buying Up Flock License Plate Readers; Giving Cops Open Access To Them\n\nClick to toggle\n\nRate this comment as insightful\n\nRate this comment as funny\n\nYou have rated this comment as insightful\n\nYou have rated this comment as funny\n\nFlag this comment as abusive/trolling/spam\n\nYou have flagged this comment\n\nThe first word has already been claimed\n\nThe last word has already been claimed\n\n## Comments on \u201cEuropean Law Enforcement Officials Declare Encryption Must Be\nBroken To Ensure Public Safety\u201d\n\nSubscribe: RSS Leave a comment\n\n5 Comments\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nAnonymous Coward says:\n\nApril 29, 2024 at 1:14 pm\n\nFor public safety we need the names, full history and psych evals of every\nofficer.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nAnonymous Coward says:\n\nApril 29, 2024 at 1:56 pm\n\nWhenever a cop spokesman says \u201cencryption must be broken\u201d, I always ask \u201cdoes\nthat include police and government encryption?\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve yet to get anything more than a dirty look.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nStrawb (profile) says:\n\nApril 29, 2024 at 1:58 pm\n\nThe decryption will continue until public safety improves!\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nAnonymous Coward says:\n\nApril 29, 2024 at 2:06 pm\n\n> However, we do not accept that there need be a binary choice between cyber\n> security or privacy on the one hand and public safety on the other.\n> Absolutism on either side is not helpful.\n\nSimilarly, they do not accept that there need be a binary choice between\ncredit cards and apples being available in your local market.\n\nCan anyone in the class tell me what classical fallacy they are demonstrating\nhere?\n\nAnyone?
