In our brains, neurons propagate signals\nelectrochemically, by moving ions \u2014 charged atoms or molecules \u2014 not\nelectrons.\u201d\n\nImplantable devices from pacemakers to glucose monitors rely on components\nthat can speak both languages and bridge that gap. Among those components are\nOECTs \u2014 or organic electrochemical transistors \u2014 which allow current to flow\nin devices like implantable biosensors. But scientists long knew about a quirk\nof OECTs that no one could explain: When an OECT is switched on, there is a\nlag before current reaches the desired operational level. When switched off,\nthere is no lag. Current drops almost immediately.\n\nA UW-led study has solved this lagging mystery, and in the process paved the\nway to custom-tailored OECTs for a growing list of applications in biosensing,\nbrain-inspired computation and beyond.\n\n\u201cHow fast you can switch a transistor is important for almost any\napplication,\u201d said project leader David Ginger, a UW professor of chemistry,\nchief scientist at the UW Clean Energy Institute and faculty member in the UW\nMolecular Engineering and Sciences Institute. \u201cScientists have recognized the\nunusual switching behavior of OECTs, but we never knew its cause \u2013 until now.\u201d\n\nThe six images shown here are microscope camera screen shots, showing the two-\nstep turn-on process for an OECT. Figures on the left indicate time. When the\nOECT is first switched on, a dark front of ions propagates across the\ntransistor from the side labeled \u201cS\u201d to the side labeled \u201cD.\u201d Afterward, the\ntransistor continues to darken as additional charge-bearing particles move\nin.Nature Materials\n\nIn a paper published April 17 in Nature Materials, Ginger\u2019s team at the UW \u2014\nalong with Professor Christine Luscombe at the Okinawa Institute of Science\nand Technology in Japan and Professor Chang-Zhi Li at Zhejiang University in\nChina \u2014 report that OECTs turn on via a two-step process, which causes the\nlag. But they appear to turn off through a simpler one-step process.\n\nIn principle, OECTs operate like transistors in electronics: When switched on,\nthey allow the flow of electrical current. When switched off, they block it.\nBut OECTs operate by coupling the flow of ions with the flow of electrons,\nwhich makes them interesting routes for interfacing with chemistry and\nbiology.\n\nThe new study illuminates the two steps OECTs go through when switched on.\nFirst, a wavefront of ions races across the transistor. Then, more charge-\nbearing particles invade the transistor\u2019s flexible structure, causing it to\nswell slightly and bringing current up to operational levels. In contrast, the\nteam discovered that deactivation is a one-step process: Levels of charged\nchemicals simply drop uniformly across the transistor, quickly interrupting\nthe flow of current.\n\nKnowing the lag\u2019s cause should help scientists design new generations of OECTs\nfor a wider set of applications.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always been this drive in technology development to make components\nfaster, more reliable and more efficient,\u201d Ginger said. \u201cYet, the \u2018rules\u2019 for\nhow OECTs behave haven\u2019t been well understood. A driving force in this work is\nto learn them and apply them to future research and development efforts.\u201d\n\nWhether they reside within devices to measure blood glucose or brain activity,\nOECTs are largely made up of flexible, organic semiconducting polymers \u2014\nrepeating units of complex, carbon-rich compounds \u2014 and operate immersed in\nliquids containing salts and other chemicals. For this project, the team\nstudied OECTs that change color in response to electrical charge. The polymer\nmaterials were synthesized by Luscombe\u2019s team at the Okinawa Institute of\nScience and Technology and Li\u2019s at Zhejiang University, and then fabricated\ninto transistors by UW doctoral students Jiajie Guo and Shinya \u201cEmerson\u201d Chen,\nwho are co-lead authors on the paper.\n\n\u201cA challenge in the materials design for OECTs lies in creating a substance\nthat facilitates effective ion transport and retains electronic conductivity,\u201d\nsaid Luscombe, who is also a UW affiliate professor of chemistry and of\nmaterials science and engineering. \u201cThe ion transport requires a flexible\nmaterial, whereas ensuring high electronic conductivity typically necessitates\na more rigid structure, posing a dilemma in the development of such\nmaterials.\u201d\n\nThe three images shown here are microscope camera screen shots, showing the\none-step turn-off process for an OECT. Figures on the left indicate time. The\nOECT appears dark at the moment of switch-off because it is loaded with\ncharge-bearing particles \u2014 also known as being fully \u201cdoped.\u201d When the OECT is\nswitched off, the number of charge-bearing particles drops rapidly across the\ntransistor, lightening its color.Nature Materials\n\nGuo and Chen observed under a microscope \u2014 and recorded with a smartphone\ncamera \u2014 precisely what happens when the custom-built OECTs are switched on\nand off. It showed clearly that a two-step chemical process lies at the heart\nof the OECT activation lag.\n\nPast research, including by Ginger\u2019s group at the UW, demonstrated that\npolymer structure, especially its flexibility, is important to how OECTs\nfunction. These devices operate in fluid-filled environments containing\nchemical salts and other biological compounds, which are more bulky compared\nto the electronic underpinnings of our digital devices.\n\nThe new study goes further by more directly linking OECT structure and\nperformance. The team found that the degree of activation lag should vary\nbased on what material the OECT is made of, such as whether its polymers are\nmore ordered or more randomly arranged, according to Giridharagopal. Future\nresearch could explore how to reduce or lengthen the lag times, which for\nOECTs in the current study were fractions of a second.\n\n\u201cDepending on the type of device you\u2019re trying to build, you could tailor\ncomposition, fluid, salts, charge carriers and other parameters to suit your\nneeds,\u201d said Giridharagopal.\n\nOECTs aren\u2019t just used in biosensing. They are also used to study nerve\nimpulses in muscles, as well as forms of computing to create artificial neural\nnetworks and understand how our brains store and retrieve information. These\nwidely divergent applications necessitate building new generations of OECTs\nwith specialized features, including ramp-up and ramp-down times, according to\nGinger.\n\n\u201cNow that we\u2019re learning the steps needed to realize those applications,\ndevelopment can really accelerate,\u201d said Ginger.\n\nGuo is now a postdoctoral researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National\nLaboratory and Chen is now a scientist at Analog Devices.
