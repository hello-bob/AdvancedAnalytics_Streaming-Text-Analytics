For several years, I have been teaching 18.30, differential\nequation, the largest mathematics course at MIT, with more than 300 students.\nThe lectures have been good training in dealing with mass behavior. Every\nsentence must be perfectly enunciated, preferably twice. Examples on the board\nmust be relevant, if not downright fascinating. Every 15 minutes or so, the\nlecturer is expected to come up with an interesting aside, joke, historical\nanecdote, or unusual application of the concept at hand. When a lecturer fails\nto conform to these inexorable requirements, the students will signify their\ndispleasure by picking by their books and leaving the classroom.  \n---  \nDespite the lecturer's best efforts, however, it becomes more difficult to\nhold the attention of the students as the term wears on, and they start\nfalling asleep in class under those circumstances should be a source of\nsatisfaction for a teacher, since it confirms that they have been doing their\njobs. There students have been up half the night-maybe all night-finishing\nproblem sets and preparing for their midterm exams.Four courses in science and\nengineering each term is a heavy workload for anyone; very few students fail\nto learn, first and foremost, the discipline of intensive and constant\nwork.Lesson Two: You learn what you don't know you are learning. The second\nlesson is demonstrated, among other places, in 18.313, a course I teach in\nadvanced probability theory. It is a difficult course, one that compresses the\nmaterial typically taught in a year into one term, and it includes weekly\nproblem sets that are hard, even by the standards of professional\nmathematicians. (How hard is that? Well, every few years a student taking the\ncourse discovers a new solution to a probability problem that merits\npublication as a research paper in a refereed journal.)Students join forces on\nthe problem sets, and some students benefit more than others from these weekly\ncollective efforts. The most brilliant students will invariably work out all\nthe problems and let other students copy, and I pretend to be annoyed when I\nlearn that this has happened. But I know that by making the effort to\nunderstand the solution of a truly difficult problem discovered by one of\ntheir peers, students learn more than they would by working out some less\ndemanding exercise.Lesson Three: By and large, \"knowing how\" matters more than\n\"knowing what.\" Half a century ago, the philosopher Gilbert Ryle discussed the\ndifference between \"knowing how\" courses are those in mathematics, the exact\nsciences, engineering, playing a musical instrument, even sports. \"Knowing\nwhat\" courses are those in the social sciences, the creative arts, the\nhumanities, and those aspects of a discipline that are described as having\nsocial value.At the beginning of each term, students meet with their advisors\nto decide on the courses each will study, and much of the discussion is likely\nto resolve around whether a student should lighten a heavy load by\nsubstituting one or two \"knowing what\" courses in place of some stiff \"knowing\nhow\" courses.To be sure, the content of \"knowing what\" courses if often the\nmost memorable. A serious study of the history of United States Constitution\nor King Lear may well leave a stronger imprint on a student's character than a\ncourse in thermodynamics. Nevertheless, at MIT, \"knowing how\" is held in\nhigher esteem than \"knowing what\" by faculty and students alike. Why?It is my\ntheory that \"knowing how\" is revered because it can be tested. One can test\nwhether a student can apply quantum mechanics, communicate in French, or clone\na gene. It is much more difficult to asses an interpretation of a poem, the\nnegotiation of a complex technical compromise, or grasp of the social dynamics\nof a small, diverse working group. Where you can test, you can set a high\nstandard of proficiency on which everyone is agreed; where you cannot test\nprecisely, proficiency becomes something of a judgment call.At certain liberal\narts colleges, sports appear to be more important than classroom subjects, and\nwith good reason. A sport may be the only training in \"knowing how\"-in\ndemonstrating certifiable proficiency-that a student undertakes at those\ncolleges. At MIT, sports are a hobby (however passionately pursued) rather\nthan a central focus because we offer a wide range of absorbing \"knowing how\"\nactivities.Lesson Four: In science and engineering, you can fool very little\nof the time. Most of the sweeping generalizations one hears about MIT\nundergraduates are too outrageous to be taken seriously. The claim that MIT\nstudents are naive, however, has struck me as being true, at least in a\nstatistical sense.Last year, for example, one of our mathematics majors, who\nhad accepted a lucrative offer of employment from a Wall Street firm,\ntelephoned to complain that the politics in his office was \"like a soap\nopera.\" More than a few MIT graduates are shocked by their first contact with\nthe professional world after graduation. There is a wide gap between the\nrealities of business, medicine, law, or applied enginering, for example, and\nthe universe of scientific objectivity and theoretical constructs that is\nMIT.An education in engineering and science is an education in intellectual\nhonesty. Students cannot avoid learning to acknowledge whether or not they\nhave really learned. Once they have taken their first quiz, all MIT\nundergraduates know dearly they will pay if they fool themselves into\nbelieving they know more than is the case.On campus, they have been accustomed\nto people being blunt to a fault about their own limitations-or skills-and\nthose of others. Unfortunately, this intellectual honesty is sometimes\ninterpreted as naivete.Lesson Five: You don't have to be a genius to do\ncreative work. The idea of genius elaborated during the Romantic Age (late\n18th and 19th centuries) has done harm to education. It is demoralizing to\ngive a young person role models of Beethoven, Einstein, and Feynman, presented\nas saintly figures who moved from insight to insight without a misstep.\nScientific biographies often fail to give a realistic description of\npersonality, and thereby create a false idea of scientific work.Young people\nwill correct any fantasies they have about genius, however, after they come to\nMIT. As they start doing research with their professors, as many MIT\nundergraduates do, they learn another healthy lesson, namely, a professor may\nwell behave like a fumbling idiot.The drive for excellence and achievement\nthat one finds everywhere at MIT has the democratic effect of placing teachers\nand students on the same level, where competence is appreciated irrespective\nof its provenance, Students learn that some of the best ideas arise in groups\nof scientists and engineers working together, and the source of these ideas\ncan seldom be pinned on specific individuals. The MIT model of scientific work\nis closer to the communion of artists that was found in the large shops of the\nRenaissance than to the image of the lonely Romantic genius.Lesson Six: You\nmust measure up to a very high level of performance. I can imagine a\npropective student or parent asking, \"Why should I (or my child) take calculus\nat MIT rather than at Oshkosh College? Isn't the material practically\nidentical, no matter where it is taught, while the cost varies a great\ndeal?\"One answer to this question would be following: One learns a lot more\nwhen taking calculus from someone who is doing research in mathematical\nanalysis than from someone who has never published a word on the subject. But\nthis is not the answer; some teachers who is doing research in mathematical\nanalysis than from someone who has never published a word on the subject. But\nthis is not the answer; some teachers who have never done any research are\nmuch better at conveying the ideas of calculus than the most brilliant\nmathematicians.What matters most is the ambiance in which the course is\ntaught; a gifted student will thrive in the company of other gifted students.\nAn MIT undergraduate will be challenged by the level of proficiency that is\nexpected of everyone at MIT, students and faculty. The expectation of high\nstandards is unconsciously absorbed and adopted by the students, and they\ncarry it with them for life.Lesson seven: The world and your career are\nunpredictable, so you are better off learning subjects of permanent value.\nSome students arrive at MIT with a career plan, many don't, but it actually\ndoesn't matter very much either way. Some of the foremost computer scientists\nof our day received their doctorates in mathematical logic, a branch of\nmathematics that was once considered farthest removed from applications but\nthat turned out instead to be the key to the development of present-day\nsoftware. A number of the leading figures in experimental molecular biology\nreceived their doctorates in physics. Dramatic career shifts that only a few\nyears ago were the exception are becoming common.Our students will have a\nharder time finding rewarding jobs than I had when I graduated in the fifties.\nThe skills the market demands, both in research and industry, are subject to\ncapricious shifts. New professions will be created, and old professions will\nbecome obsolete with the span of a few years. Today's college students have\ngood cause to be apprehensive about future.The curriculum that most\nundergraduates at MIT choose to follow focuses less on current occupational\nskills than on those fundamental areas of science and engineering that at\nleast likely to be affected by technological changes.Lesson Eight: You are\nnever going to catch up, and neither is anyone else. MIT students often\ncomplain of being overworked, and they are right. When I look at the schedules\nof courses my advisees propose at the beginning of each term, I wonder how\nthey can contemplate that much work. My workload was nothing like that when I\nwas an undergraduate.The platitudes about the disappearance of leisure are,\nunfortunately, true, and faculty members at MIT are as heavily burdened as\nstudents. There is some satisfaction, however, for a faculty member in\nencountering a recent graduate who marvels at the light work load they carry\nin medical school or law school relative to the grueling schedule they had to\nmaintain during their four years at MIT.Lesson Nine: The future belongs to the\ncomputer-literate-squared. Much has been said about computer literacy, and I\nsuspect you would prefer not to hear more on the subject. Instead, I would\nlike to propose the concept computer-literacy-squared, in other words computer\nliteracy to second degree.A large fraction of MIT undergraduates major in\ncomputer science or at least acquire extensive computer skills that are\napplicable in other fields. In their second year, they catch on to the fact\nthat their required courses in computer science do not provide the whole\nstory. Not because of deficiencies in the syllabus; quite the opposite. The\nundergraduate curriculum in computer science at MIT is probably the most\nprogressive and advanced such curriculum anywhere. Rather, the students learn\nthat side by side with required courses there is another, hidden curriculum\nconsisting of new ideas just coming into use, new techniques and that spread\nlike wildfire, opening up unsuspected applications that will eventually be\nadopted into the official curriculum.Keeping up with this hidden curriculum is\nwhat will enable a computer scientist to stay ahead in the field. Those who do\nnot become computer scientists to the second degree risk turning into\nprogrammers who will only implement the ideas of others.Lesson Ten:\nMathematics is still the queen of the sciences. Having tried in lessons one\nthrough nine to take an unbiased look at the big MIT picture, I'd like to\nconclude with a plug for my own field, mathematics.When an undergraduate asks\nme whether he or she should major in mathematics rather than in another field\nthat I will simply call X, my answer is the following: \"If you major in\nmathematics, you can switch to X anytime you want to, but not the other way\naround.\"Alumni who return to visit invariably complain of not having taken\nenough math courses while they were undergraduates. It is a fact, confirmed by\nthe history of science since Galileo and Newton, that the more theoretical and\nremoved from immediate applications a scientific topic appears to be, the more\nlikely it is to eventually find the most striking practical applications.\nConsider number theory, which only 20 years ago was believed to be the most\nuseless chapter of mathematics and is today the core of computer security. The\nefficient factorization of integers into prime numbers, a topic of seemingly\nbreathtaking obscurity, is now cultivated with equal passion by software\ndesigers and code breakers.I am often asked why there are so few applied\nmathematicians in the department at MIT. The reason is that all of MIT is one\nhuge applied mathematics department; you can find applied mathematicians in\npracticially every department at MIT except mathematics.  \nFrom the Association of Alumni and Alumnae of MIT April 1997\n\n", "frontpage": false}
