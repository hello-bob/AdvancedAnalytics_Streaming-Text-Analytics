The\ncommunity is nestled in a valley packed with pine trees. Signs warning of \u201clog\ntrucks entering\u201d are sprinkled along the highway toward town. Log buildings\nare everywhere.\n\nBut, Seeley Lake may not be able to call itself a timber town for much longer.\nThe community \u2014 and the state\u2019s once-booming lumber industry \u2014 suffered a blow\nin March when Pyramid Mountain Lumber announced plans to shut down. The Seeley\nLake business\u2019 owners said a changing economy and a housing crunch made it\nimpossible to stay in business.\n\nNow, mill workers and Seeley Lake residents are grasping for a future that may\nnot include timber.\n\nPyramid Mountain Lumber operates on a sprawling patch of brown earth covered\nby piles of massive logs and mountains of wood chips. Inside the mill,\n58-year-old plant manager Todd Johnson surveyed a stream of two-by-fours\nrattling by on a conveyor belt.\n\nAustin Amestoy\n\n/\n\nMTPR\n\nPyramid Mountain Lumber plant manager Todd Johnson poses for a photo in an\noffice lined with memories. His grandfather founded the mill in the late 40s,\nand its been in his family ever since.\n\n\u201cThis is just the finish end,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThis is what\u2019s coming out the\nend of the whole process.\u201d\n\nHis grandfather founded the mill in the late 40s, and it\u2019s the only work\nJohnson has ever known. This fall, he and the plant\u2019s 100 employees will\nlikely be out of a job. But, Johnson said it\u2019s not for a lack of logs to mill.\n\n\u201cOur housing costs have increased so much after COVID, you know, the blue-\ncollar workforce is having a hard time living in rural communities,\u201d he said\nin an interview with MTPR.\n\nIn Missoula County, where the mill is located, themedian home price shot up\n55% since the start of the pandemic to more than half a million dollars. And,\nSeeley Lake has struggled to build new housing for decades, lacking a sewer\nsystem to make construction cheaper.\n\nJohnson said Pyramid spent the last 10 years short on labor thanks to the\nhousing crunch. Then inflation spiked and lumber prices fell sharply from\npandemic highs.\n\nNow, Johnson is struggling with what comes next.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to find something,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll cross that bridge when it\ncomes.\u201d\n\nIn the days before trucks and trains, lumberjacks in Montana would float logs\ndownstream by the thousands to sawmills hungry for wood. When Pyramid Mountain\nLumber shuts down, though, Missoula county will be without a mill for the\nfirst time since the frontier days. So, what happened?\n\nAccording to one regional economist \u2014 the economics of lumber milling have\nchanged.\n\nBryce Ward said the same mountains and lakes that made Montana prime timber\ncountry are now attracting people for different reasons.\n\n\u201cNot just tourism based,\u201d Ward said. \u201cYou know, a tech company that can really\nlocate anywhere \u2014 \u2018My workers really like those mountains and trees, so we\u2019ll\nlocate there.\u2019 And, that\u2019s what drives, then, the housing price growth.\u201d\n\nAt least three Montana sawmills shuttered in the last decade and laid off more\nthan 300 people, according to state data. Less than a week after Pyramid\nMountain Lumber announced its closure, Roseburg Forest Products in Missoula\ndid the same, laying off its 170 workers.\n\nNow, Seeley Lake residents are grappling with the potential fallout of losing\ntheir largest employer.\n\nAustin Amestoy\n\n/\n\nMTPR\n\nSeeley Lake Elementary School principal Josh Gibbs says about 10% of his\nstudents have parents who work at the mill. He\u2019s concerned what might happen\nto the school if those families leave to find jobs elsewhere.\n\nA couple of blocks from the mill, Seeley Lake Elementary School echoes with\nthe sound of dribbling basketballs. Just down the hall in a sparse office,\nprincipal Josh Gibbs crunched the numbers: 165 enrolled students, 18 of whom\nhave parents who work at the mill.\n\n\u201cIf you were to look at a possible worst-case scenario of all those people\nleaving town for new job opportunities or career opportunities, that is 10 to\n11% of our enrollment,\u201d Gibbs said.\n\nSince school funding in Montana is tied to enrollment, those possible\ndepartures could mean layoffs at the elementary school. Gibbs wonders what\nwill happen to the electricians and plumbers who work with the mill, or the\nrestaurants that serve mill employees, or the town\u2019s sole grocery store.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s that transition of, \u2018What\u2019s the new identity of our town going to\nbe?\u2019\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cWhat\u2019s it going to grow to be, and how are we \u2014 or are we \u2014\ngoing to survive?\u201d\n\nEconomist Bryce Ward envisioned two possible futures for Seeley Lake:\n\n\u201cIt will either be smaller, or it will be Big Sky,\u201d he said.\n\nBig Sky: a ski-resort town where themedian household income is nearly a\nhundred thousand dollars and the luxury real estate marketis booming.\n\nSeeley Lake doesn\u2019t have a ski resort, but it does draw snowmobilers,\nbackcountry and nordic skiers, hikers and remote workers looking for a\nlakeside view.\n\nLocal business and government leaders have said they\u2019re talking about ways to\npotentially keep the mill running, too. But without a major investment, that\nwill be an uphill battle.\n\nTodd Johnson, the timber mill manager who\u2019s worked there since he was 12, said\nhe\u2019ll miss it, and his co-workers. There are many unknowns ahead, but he\u2019s\ncertain about one thing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not leaving,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI\u2019m born-and-raised Seeley Lake. I\u2019m not\ngoing anywhere.\u201d\n\nWhat may fade away is a backdrop of familiar sounds, like the rumble of a\ntruck turning onto the highway out of town after delivering one of the mill\u2019s\nfinal loads of timber.\n\nAustin Amestoy\n\n/\n\nMTPR\n\nPyramid Mountain Lumber has withstood several near-closures through the years,\nbut its owners say a storm of falling lumber prices and rising expenses have\nforced their hand.\n\n  * Montana News\n\nBusiness, government leaders seek new buyer to save one of western Montana's\nsawmills\n\nAustin Amestoy\n\n, April 6, 2024\n\nMore than 30 business leaders and government officials met in Missoula Friday\nto discuss ways to keep western Montana\u2019s wood products industry afloat after\ntwo sawmills announced closures.\n\n  * Montana News\n\nPyramid Mountain Lumber in Seeley Lake is closing\n\nAustin Amestoy\n\n, March 21, 2024\n\nMissoula County\u2019s last traditional lumber mill is shutting down after 75 years\nin business.
