For other uses, see ICD (disambiguation).\n\nThe International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is a globally used medical\nclassification used in epidemiology, health management and for clinical\npurposes. The ICD is maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO), which\nis the directing and coordinating authority for health within the United\nNations System.^[1] The ICD is originally designed as a health care\nclassification system, providing a system of diagnostic codes for classifying\ndiseases, including nuanced classifications of a wide variety of signs,\nsymptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external\ncauses of injury or disease. This system is designed to map health conditions\nto corresponding generic categories together with specific variations,\nassigning for these a designated code, up to six characters long. Thus, major\ncategories are designed to include a set of similar diseases.\n\nThe ICD is published by the WHO and used worldwide for morbidity and mortality\nstatistics, reimbursement systems, and automated decision support in health\ncare. This system is designed to promote international comparability in the\ncollection, processing, classification, and presentation of these statistics.\nThe ICD is a major project to statistically classify all health disorders, and\nprovide diagnostic assistance. The ICD is a core statistically based\nclassificatory diagnostic system for health care related issues of the WHO\nFamily of International Classifications (WHO-FIC).^[2]\n\nThe ICD is revised periodically and is currently in its 11th revision. The\nICD-11, as it is therefore known, was accepted by WHO's World Health Assembly\n(WHA) on 25 May 2019 and officially came into effect on 1 January 2022.^[3] On\n11 February 2022, the WHO stated that 35 countries were using the ICD-11.^[4]\n\nThe ICD is part of a \"family\" of international classifications (WHOFIC) that\ncomplement each other, also including the International Classification of\nFunctioning, Disability and Health (ICF) which focuses on the domains of\nfunctioning (disability) associated with health conditions, from both medical\nand social perspectives, and the International Classification of Health\nInterventions (ICHI) that classifies the whole range of medical, nursing,\nfunctioning and public health interventions.\n\nThe title of the ICD is formally the International Statistical Classification\nof Diseases and Related Health Problems, although the original title,\nInternational Classification of Diseases, is still informally the name by\nwhich it is usually known.\n\nIn the United States and some other countries, the Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is preferred for the classification of mental\ndisorders for some purposes.\n\n## Historical synopsis[edit]\n\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

(July 2017) (Learn how and\nwhen to remove this template message)  \n---  \n  \nIn 1860, during the international statistical congress held in London,\nFlorence Nightingale made a proposal that was to result in the development of\nthe first model of systematic collection of hospital data. In 1893, a French\nphysician, Jacques Bertillon, introduced the Bertillon Classification of\nCauses of Death at a congress of the International Statistical Institute in\nChicago.^[5]^[6]\n\nA number of countries adopted Bertillon's system, which was based on the\nprinciple of distinguishing between general diseases and those localized to a\nparticular organ or anatomical site, as used by the City of Paris for\nclassifying deaths. Subsequent revisions represented a synthesis of English,\nGerman, and Swiss classifications, expanding from the original 44 titles to\n161 titles. In 1898, the American Public Health Association (APHA) recommended\nthat the registrars of Canada, Mexico, and the United States also adopt it.\nThe APHA also recommended revising the system every 10 years to ensure the\nsystem remained current with medical practice advances. As a result, the first\ninternational conference to revise the International Classification of Causes\nof Death took place in 1900, with revisions occurring every ten years\nthereafter. At that time, the classification system was contained in one book,\nwhich included an Alphabetic Index as well as a Tabular List. The book was\nsmall compared with current coding texts.\n\nThe revisions that followed contained minor changes, until the sixth revision\nof the classification system. With the sixth revision, the classification\nsystem expanded to two volumes. The sixth revision included morbidity and\nmortality conditions, and its title was modified to reflect the changes:\nInternational Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of\nDeath (ICD). Prior to the sixth revision, responsibility for ICD revisions\nfell to the Mixed Commission, a group composed of representatives from the\nInternational Statistical Institute and the Health Organization of the League\nof Nations. In 1948, the WHO assumed responsibility for preparing and\npublishing the revisions to the ICD every ten years.^[7] WHO sponsored the\nseventh and eighth revisions in 1957 and 1968, respectively. It later became\nclear that the established ten year interval between revisions was too short.\n\nThe ICD is currently the most widely used statistical classification system\nfor diseases in the world.^[8] In addition, some countries\u2014including\nAustralia, Canada, and the United States\u2014have developed their own adaptations\nof ICD, with more procedure codes for classification of operative or\ndiagnostic procedures.\n\n## Versions of ICD[edit]\n\n### ICD-6[edit]\n\nThe ICD-6, published in 1949, was the first to be shaped to become suitable\nfor morbidity reporting. Accordingly, the name changed from International List\nof Causes of Death to International Statistical Classification of Diseases.\nThe combined code section for injuries and their associated accidents was\nsplit into two, a chapter for injuries, and a chapter for their external\ncauses. With use for morbidity there was a need for coding mental conditions,\nand for the first time a section on mental disorders was added .^[9]^[10]\n\n### ICD-7[edit]\n\nThe International Conference for the Seventh Revision of the International\nClassification of Diseases was held in Paris under the auspices of WHO in\nFebruary 1955. In accordance with a recommendation of the WHO Expert Committee\non Health Statistics, this revision was limited to essential changes and\namendments of errors and inconsistencies.^[10]\n\n### ICD-8[edit]\n\nThe 8th Revision Conference convened by WHO met in Geneva, from 6 to 12 July\n1965. This revision was more radical than the Seventh but left unchanged the\nbasic structure of the Classification and the general philosophy of\nclassifying diseases, whenever possible, according to their etiology rather\nthan a particular manifestation. During the years that the Seventh and Eighth\nRevisions of the ICD were in force, the use of the ICD for indexing hospital\nmedical records increased rapidly and some countries prepared national\nadaptations which provided the additional detail needed for this application\nof the ICD.\n\n#### ICDA-8 (United States)[edit]\n\nIn the US, a group of consultants was asked to study the ICD-8 for its\napplicability to various users in the United States. This group recommended\nthat further detail be provided for coding hospital and morbidity data. The\nAmerican Hospital Association's \"Advisory Committee to the Central Office on\nICDA\" developed the needed adaptation proposals, resulting in the publication\nof the International Classification of Diseases, Adapted (ICDA). In 1968, the\nUnited States Public Health Service published the International Classification\nof Diseases, Adapted, 8th Revision for use in the United States (ICDA-8).\nBeginning in 1968, ICDA-8 served as the basis for coding diagnostic data for\nboth official morbidity and mortality statistics in the United\nStates.^[10]^[11]\n\n### ICD-9[edit]\n\nSee also: List of ICD-9 codes\n\nThe International Conference for the Ninth Revision of the International\nStatistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries, and Causes of Death,\nconvened by WHO, met in Geneva from 30 September to 6 October 1975. In the\ndiscussions leading up to the conference, it had originally been intended that\nthere should be little change other than updating of the classification. This\nwas mainly because of the expense of adapting data processing systems each\ntime the classification was revised.\n\nThere had been an enormous growth of interest in the ICD and ways had to be\nfound of responding to this, partly by modifying the classification itself and\npartly by introducing special coding provisions. A number of representations\nwere made by specialist bodies which had become interested in using the ICD\nfor their own statistics. Some subject areas in the classification were\nregarded as inappropriately arranged and there was considerable pressure for\nmore detail and for adaptation of the classification to make it more relevant\nfor the evaluation of medical care, by classifying conditions to the chapters\nconcerned with the part of the body affected rather than to those dealing with\nthe underlying generalized disease.^[6]\n\nAt the other end of the scale, there were representations from countries and\nareas where a detailed and sophisticated classification was irrelevant, but\nwhich nevertheless needed a classification based on the ICD in order to assess\ntheir progress in health care and in the control of disease. A field test with\na bi-axial classification approach\u2014one axis (criterion) for anatomy, with\nanother for etiology\u2014showed the impracticability of such approach for routine\nuse.^[citation needed]\n\nThe final proposals presented to and accepted by the Conference in 1978^[12]\nretained the basic structure of the ICD, although with much additional detail\nat the level of the four digit subcategories, and some optional five digit\nsubdivisions. For the benefit of users not requiring such detail, care was\ntaken to ensure that the categories at the three digit level were appropriate.\n\nAs the World Health Organization explains: \"For the benefit of users wishing\nto produce statistics and indexes oriented towards medical care, the 9th\nRevision included an optional alternative method of classifying diagnostic\nstatements, including information about both an underlying general disease and\na manifestation in a particular organ or site. This system became known as the\n'dagger and asterisk system' and is retained in the Tenth Revision. A number\nof other technical innovations were included in the Ninth Revision, aimed at\nincreasing its flexibility for use in a variety of situations.\"^[13]\n\nIt was eventually replaced by ICD-10, the version currently in use by the WHO\nand most countries. Given the widespread expansion in the tenth revision, it\nis not possible to convert ICD-9 data sets directly into ICD-10 data sets,\nalthough some tools are available to help guide users.^[14] Publication of\nICD-9 without IP restrictions in a world with evolving electronic data systems\nled to a range of products based on ICD-9, such as MeDRA or the Read\ndirectory.^[10]^[11]\n\n#### International Classification of Procedures in Medicine (ICPM)[edit]\n\nWhen ICD-9 was published by the World Health Organization (WHO), the\nInternational Classification of Procedures in Medicine (ICPM) was also\ndeveloped (1975) and published (1978). The ICPM surgical procedures fascicle\nwas originally created by the United States, based on its adaptations of ICD\n(called ICDA), which had contained a procedure classification since 1962. ICPM\nis published separately from the ICD disease classification as a series of\nsupplementary documents called fascicles (bundles or groups of items). Each\nfascicle contains a classification of modes of laboratory, radiology, surgery,\ntherapy, and other diagnostic procedures. Many countries have adapted and\ntranslated the ICPM in parts or as a whole and are using it with amendments\nsince then.^[10]^[11]\n\n#### ICD-9-CM (United States)[edit]\n\nThe International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)\nwas an adaptation created by the US National Center for Health Statistics\n(NCHS) and used in assigning diagnostic and procedure codes associated with\ninpatient, outpatient, and physician office utilization in the United States.\nThe ICD-9-CM is based on the ICD-9 but provides for additional morbidity\ndetail. It was updated annually on October 1.^[15]^[16]\n\nIt consists three volumes:\n\n  * Volumes 1 and 2 contain diagnosis codes. (Volume 1 is a tabular listing, and volume 2 is an index.) Extended for ICD-9-CM\n  * Volume 3 contains procedure codes for surgical, diagnostic, and therapeutic procedures.^[17] ICD-9-CM only\n\nThe NCHS and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are the US\ngovernmental agencies responsible for overseeing all changes and modifications\nto the ICD-9-CM.\n\n### ICD-10[edit]\n\nMain article: ICD-10\n\nWork on ICD-10 began in 1983, and the new revision was endorsed by the Forty-\nthird World Health Assembly in May 1990. The latest version came into use in\nWHO Member States starting in 1994.^[18] The classification system allows more\nthan 55,000 different codes and permits tracking of many new diagnoses and\nprocedures, a significant expansion on the 17,000 codes available in\nICD-9.^[19] Adoption was relatively swift in most of the world. Several\nmaterials are made available online by WHO to facilitate its use, including a\nmanual, training guidelines, a browser, and files for download.^[2] Some\ncountries have adapted the international standard, such as the \"ICD-10-AM\"\npublished in Australia in 1998 (also used in New Zealand),^[20] and the\n\"ICD-10-CA\" introduced in Canada in 2000.^[21]\n\n#### ICD-10-CM (United States)[edit]\n\nMain article: ICD-10-CM\n\nAdoption of ICD-10-CM was slow in the United States. Since 1979, the US had\nrequired ICD-9-CM codes^[11] for Medicare and Medicaid claims, and most of the\nrest of the American medical industry followed suit. On 1 January 1999 the\nICD-10 (without clinical extensions) was adopted for reporting mortality, but\nICD-9-CM was still used for morbidity. Meanwhile, NCHS received permission\nfrom the WHO to create a clinical modification of the ICD-10, and has\nproduction of all these systems:\n\n  * ICD-10-CM, for diagnosis codes, replaces volumes 1 and 2. Annual updates are provided.\n  * ICD-10-PCS, for procedure codes, replaces volume 3. Annual updates are provided.\n\nOn 21 August 2008, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\nproposed new code sets to be used for reporting diagnoses and procedures on\nhealth care transactions. Under the proposal, the ICD-9-CM code sets would be\nreplaced with the ICD-10-CM code sets, effective 1 October 2013. On 17 April\n2012 the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a proposed\nrule that would delay, from 1 October 2013 to 1 October 2014, the compliance\ndate for the ICD-10-CM and PCS.^[22] Once again, Congress delayed\nimplementation date to 1 October 2015, after it was inserted into \"Doc Fix\"\nBill without debate over objections of many.\n\nRevisions to ICD-10-CM Include:\n\n  * Relevant information for ambulatory and managed care encounter.\n  * Expanded injury codes.\n  * New combination codes for diagnosis/symptoms to reduce the number of codes needed to describe a problem fully.\n  * Addition of sixth and seventh digit classification.\n  * Classification specific to laterality.\n  * Classification refinement for increased data granularity.\n\n#### ICD-10-CA (Canada)[edit]\n\nICD-10-CA is a clinical modification of ICD-10 developed by the Canadian\nInstitute for Health Information for morbidity classification in Canada.\nICD-10-CA applies beyond acute hospital care, and includes conditions and\nsituations that are not diseases but represent risk factors to health, such as\noccupational and environmental factors, lifestyle and psycho-social\ncircumstances.^[21]\n\n### ICD-11[edit]\n\nMain article: ICD-11\n\nThe eleventh revision of the International Classification of Diseases, or the\nICD-11, is almost five times as big as the ICD-10.^[23] It was created\nfollowing a decade of development involving over 300 specialists from 55\ncountries.^[24]^[25]^[26] Following an alpha version in May 2011 and a beta\ndraft in May 2012, a stable version of the ICD-11 was released on 18 June\n2018,^[27] and officially endorsed by all WHO members during the 72nd World\nHealth Assembly on 25 May 2019.^[28]\n\nFor the ICD-11, the WHO decided to differentiate between the core of the\nsystem and its derived specialty versions, such as the ICD-O for oncology. As\nsuch, the collection of all ICD entities is called the Foundation Component.\nFrom this common core, subsets can be derived. The primary derivative of the\nFoundation is called the ICD-11 MMS, and it is this system that is commonly\nreferred to and recognized as \"the ICD-11\".^[29] MMS stands for Mortality and\nMorbidity Statistics.\n\nICD-11 comes with an implementation package that includes transition tables\nfrom and to ICD-10, a translation tool, a coding tool, web-services, a manual,\ntraining material, and more.^[30] All tools are accessible after self-\nregistration from the Maintenance Platform.\n\nThe ICD-11 officially came into effect on 1 January 2022, although the WHO\nadmitted that \"not many countries are likely to adapt that quickly\".^[31] In\nthe United States, the advisory body of the Secretary of Health and Human\nServices has given an expected release year of 2025, but if a clinical\nmodification is determined to be needed (similar to the ICD-10-CM), this could\nbecome 2027.^[32]\n\n## Usage in the United States[edit]\n\nIn the United States, the US Public Health Service published The International\nClassification of Diseases, Adapted for Indexing of Hospital Records and\nOperation Classification (ICDA), completed in 1962 and expanding the ICD-7 in\na number of areas to more completely meet the indexing needs of hospitals. The\nUS Public Health Service later published the Eighth Revision, International\nClassification of Diseases, Adapted for Use in the United States, commonly\nreferred to as ICDA-8, for official national morbidity and mortality\nstatistics. This was followed by the ICD, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification,\nknown as ICD-9-CM, published by the US Department of Health and Human Services\nand used by hospitals and other healthcare facilities to better describe the\nclinical picture of the patient. The diagnosis component of ICD-9-CM is\ncompletely consistent with ICD-9 codes, and remains the data standard for\nreporting morbidity. National adaptations of the ICD-10 progressed to\nincorporate both clinical code (ICD-10-CM) and procedure code (ICD-10-PCS)\nwith the revisions completed in 2003. In 2009, the US Centers for Medicare and\nMedicaid Services announced that it would begin using ICD-10 on April 1, 2010,\nwith full compliance by all involved parties by 2013.^[19] However, the US\nextended the deadline twice and did not formally require transitioning to\nICD-10-CM (for most clinical encounters) until October 1, 2015.\n\nThe years for which causes of death in the United States have been classified\nby each revision as follows:\n\n  * ICD-1: 1900\n  * ICD-2: 1910\n  * ICD-3: 1921\n  * ICD-4: 1930\n  * ICD-5: 1939\n  * ICD-6: 1949\n  * ICD-7: 1958\n  * ICDA-8: 1968\n  * ICD-9-CM: 1979\n  * ICD-10-CM: 1999\n\nCause of death on United States death certificates, statistically compiled by\nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are coded in the ICD,\nwhich does not include codes for human and system factors commonly called\nmedical errors.^[33]^[34]\n\n## Mental health conditions[edit]\n\nThe various ICD editions include sections that classify mental and behavioural\ndisorders. The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders:\nClinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Guidelines \u2013 also known as the \"blue\nbook\" \u2013 is derived from Chapter V of ICD-10 and gives the diagnostic criteria\nfor the conditions listed at each category therein. The blue book was\ndeveloped separately to, but coexists with, the Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual of Mental Disorders (DSM) of the American Psychiatric\nAssociation\u2014though both seek to use the same diagnostic classifications. A\nsurvey of psychiatrists in 66 countries comparing use of the ICD-10 and DSM-IV\nfound that the former was more often used for clinical diagnosis while the\nlatter was more valued for research.^[35]\n\nAs part of the development of the ICD-11, WHO established an \"International\nAdvisory Group\" to guide what would become the chapter on \"Mental, behavioural\nor neurodevelopmental disorders\".^[36]^[37] The working group proposed that\nICD-11 should declassify the categories within ICD-10 at \"F66 Psychological\nand behavioural disorders that are associated with sexual development and\norientation\".^[36]^[38] The group reported to WHO that there was \"no evidence\"\nthese classifications were clinically useful, as they do not \"contribute to\nhealth service delivery or treatment selection nor provide essential\ninformation for public health surveillance.\"^[36] Adding that; despite ICD-10\nexplicitly stating \"sexual orientation by itself is not to be considered a\ndisorder\", the inclusion of such categories \"suggest that mental disorders\nexist that are uniquely linked to sexual orientation and gender expression.\" A\nposition already recognised by the DSM, as well as other classification\nsystems.\n\nThe ICD is actually the official system for the US,^[citation needed] although\nmany mental health professionals do not realize this due to the dominance of\nthe DSM.\n\nA psychologist has stated: \"Serious problems with the clinical utility of both\nthe ICD and the DSM are widely acknowledged.\"^[39]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Medicine portal\n\n  * Clinical coder\n  * Medical classifications\n\n    * Classification of mental disorders\n    * Classification of Pharmaco-Therapeutic Referrals\n    * International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC)\n    * Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), a framework being developed by the National Institute of Mental Health\n  * Medical diagnosis\n\n    * Diagnosis-related group (DRG)\n  * Medical terminology\n\n    * Current Procedural Terminology\n    * MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities)\n    * SNOMED CT\n  * WHO Family of International Classifications\n\n    * International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health\n    * International Classification of Health Interventions\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"About WHO\".
