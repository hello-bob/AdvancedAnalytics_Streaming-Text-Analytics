Fylladitakis on April 22, 2024 9:00 AM EST\n\n  * Posted in\n  * Cases/Cooling/PSUs\n  * Eurocom\n\n8 Comments | Add A Comment\n\n8 Comments + Add A Comment\n\nWhile desktop PC power supplies receive the bulk of enthusiasts\u2019 attention for\ngood reasons \u2013 not the least of which being the vast selection of options that\ncomes from being a standardized part \u2013 power supplies as a whole aren\u2019t just a\nconcern for big PCs. With the majority of PC sales having flipped to notebook\nsales some years ago, notebook power supplies already lead the market in\nvolume. And while most laptops don\u2019t need the kind of massively powered PSUs\nthat dominate the desktop space, even that is slowly changing as desktop\nreplacement-class laptops increasingly grow in performance and power\nconsumption.\n\nPerhaps the poster-child for the high-performance, high-powered laptop is\nEurocom, who has a long history of developing heavy-duty DTR laptops that are\nall but portable desktop systems. Following recent trends in GPU power\nconsumption and in GPU popularity for both gaming and AI workloads, the\ncompany has been selling a range of \u201cmobile supercomputers\u201d, which are\npractically large, tailor-made laptops that rival even the best of desktop\ncomputers \u2013 and have the power requirements to match.\n\nIn order to power their own high-end laptops, Eurocom has developed a rather\nunusual 780W AC adapter for high-performance laptops. Intended to power the\nmost powerful of powerful laptops, their latest power adapter can supply over\nthree-quarters of a kilowatt of DC power; a desktop-like wattage for a\ndesktop-like device. It\u2019s a laptop power adapter that\u2019s unique in its scale,\nand with some room to scale up even further.\n\nEurocom 780W AC Adapter Power specifications  \n---  \nRAIL| +20V  \nMAX OUTPUT| 39A  \n780W  \nDIMENSIONS| 325 x 110 x 40mm, 1.38kg  \nAC INPUT| 90 - 264 VAC, 50 - 60 Hz  \nMSRP| PSU: $299, Cable: $129+  \n  \nEurocom has offered this adapter for a few years now. But it\u2019s taken on a new\nlife as more laptops have been released that use such a large adapter (or two\nsmaller 300W-ish power adapters). And, critically, Eurocom has made additional\nDC cable/connector sets for other manufactuers\u2019 laptops, significantly\nincreasing the number of systems it\u2019s compatible with. Currently, Eurocom\noffers DC cables for the following laptops:\n\n  * Alienware M17x M18x; 1x DC Cable ; w/ barrel AW connector; 193cm/6.4ft\n  * Alienware AREA 51m; 1x DC Cable + Splitter Box w/ 2x barrel AW connectors; 152cm/5ft\n  * ASUS ROG G18 Strix; GX501V; GM501; GM501GM; GX531GM; 1x DC Cable; w/ barrel ROG connector\n  * ASUS G703GX, GZ700GX; 1x DC Cable w/ 2x ROG barrel connectors; 152cm/5ft\n  * CLEVO, OriginPC, Sager, XMG, EUROCOM laptops; 1x DC Cable; w/ 4-pin round connector; 182cm / 6ft\n  * CLEVO X370SNx; 1x DC Cable; w/ square connector; 120cm / 3.8ft\n  * CLEVO X170SM/X170KM; 1x DC Cable; w/ dual square connectors; 152cm / 5ft\n  * Dell Precision 7720/7710; 1x DC Cable; w/ barrel Dell connector; 120cm / 3.8ft\n  * MSI GE76, GT76, GT77, GE78HX Raider, Titan 18HX 1x DC Cable; w/ single square connector; 120cm / 3.8ft\n  * MSI laptops & MSI Trident AS Gaming Desktops; 1x DC Cable; w/ 4-pin round connector; 182cm / 6ft\n\n## The Eurocom 780W AC Adapter\n\nExternally, the Eurocom 780W AC adapter looks like a hybrid between a PC PSU\nand a laptop adapter. It is shaped like an oversized laptop AC adapter but has\na metallic body and cooling vents/fans. Eurocom advertises that it weighs\n\u201conly 1.34kg\u201d, which is the weight of an entire 14-inch laptop by comparison,\nbut is relatively lightweight for a PSU with that kind of power output. The\ncompany logo is debossed across the top side of the adapter, with four round\nanti-slip pads found at its bottom. Care needs to be taken while moving it\naround because the metallic edges and weight can spell trouble for wooden\nsurfaces.\n\nEurocom installed a small information display on the AC adapter, which shows\nthe current, voltage, and power output, as well as the temperature of the\nadapter. It is not perfectly accurate \u2013 we can see it was reading a 12W load\nwithout a DC cable attached to the adapter \u2013 but it works as a basic\nreference. Next to it, there is a heavy-duty metallic connector for the DC\ncable. On the other side we can find a typical three-prong C14 AC cable\nreceptacle, as well as an on/off switch, which is not something commonly found\non laptop AC adapters.\n\nOpening up the chassis, we can see that the Eurocom 780W AC adapter is not\nunlike common PC PSUs \u2013 just less complex due to the need to only generate a\nsingle 20V rail. The basic layout is identical, with an AC filter at the input\nconsisting of four Y capacitors, two X capacitors, and two substantial\nfiltering inductors, that leads to a rectifying bridge. The GBJ1508 bridge is\nmade by HY Electronic Cayman Ltd, a Taiwanese company we're encountering for\nthe first time.\n\nThen we have an APFC circuitry with a massive Aishi 450V/560\u03bcF capacitor and a\nlarge filtering coil being its passive components, with a Toshiba K31N60W\nregulator on the same heatsink as the two MOSFETs that form a typical half-\nbridge configuration. Following that we have a small transformer and two\nInfineon 045N10N MOSFETs to generate the 20V power output. Cooling is provided\nby two Protechnic Electric MGT3812XB-W20 38 mm fans, which are small but high\nquality products with a double-ball bearing engine.\n\n## Test Results (~25\u00b0C Ambient)\n\nFor the testing of PSUs, we are using high precision electronic loads with a\nmaximum power draw of 2700 Watts, a Rigol DS5042M 40 MHz oscilloscope, an\nExtech 380803 power analyzer, two high precision UNI-T UT-325 digital\nthermometers, an Extech HD600 SPL meter, and various other bits and parts.\n\nThe average efficiency of the Eurocom 780W AC adapter is very high, at 91.6%\nwhen the PSU is powered from an 230V AC source and drops down to 90.9% when\npowered from an 115V AC source. There is no 80Plus or similar efficiency\ncertification covering this PSU, but there is legislation such as the\nEcodesign 2019/1782 directive, and, even though the manufacturer does not\nfully publish its performance specs as the directive requires, the Eurocom\n780W adapter seems to easily meet them. We must mention that this kind of PSU\nhas an advantage over classic PC PSUs because it only generates a single\nvoltage line, and conversion losses are lower, so it should not be directly\ncompared to any multi-voltage output PSU.\n\nThe two small fans of the Eurocom 780W AC adapter seem hardwired to the power\noutput of the unit, largely ignoring the temperature of the adapter and\nadjusting their speed only according to the load. Up to 40% load, which should\ncover the power needs of most gaming laptops anyway, the adapter is\npractically entirely silent. The speed of the fan gradually increases when the\nload is greater than 330 Watts, reaching terrifying noise figures at maximum\nload. Given the nature of the adapter, it is highly unlikely that it will\noperate at such high a load for prolonged periods of time, as even the laptops\nthat require 2x330 Watt adapters will not continuously sustain such a high\nload.\n\n## Power Supply Quality\n\nThe electrical performance of the Eurocom 780W AC adapter is surprisingly good\ncompared to its datasheet specifications. Eurocom claims a maximum voltage\nripple of 200 mV but we recorded a maximum of 116 mV, which is alright for a\n20 V rail and better than we expected due to the mediocre secondary side\nfiltering. Voltage regulation is very good, at just 1.2% across the nominal\nload range.\n\nMain Output  \n---  \nLoad (Watts)| 158.03| 394.68| 586.46| 780.78  \nLoad (Percent)| 20% Load| 50% Load| 75% Load| 100% Load  \nAmperes| Volts| Amperes| Volts| Amperes| Volts| Amperes| Volts  \n20 V| 7.8| 20.26| 19.5| 20.24| 29.25| 20.05| 39| 20.02  \nLine| Regulation (20% to 100% load)| Voltage Ripple (mV)  \n---|---|---  \n20% Load| 50% Load| 75% Load| 100% Load  \n20V| 1.2%| 44| 66| 82| 116  \n  \nDuring our routine evaluation, we examine the fundamental protection features\nof all power supply units we review, including Over Current Protection (OCP),\nOver Voltage Protection (OVP), Over Power Protection (OPP), and Short Circuit\nProtection (SCP). The Eurocom 780W AC adapter behaves quite oddly here, as it\nhas a rated output of 39 A and a maximum output of 45 A for 25 ms. However, we\nwere able to draw 50 A from the unit, which is nearly 1000 Watts, for several\nminutes without triggering the OCP/OPP protection. The PSU did not show any\nserious signs of stress or overheating over that time, nor poor electrical\nperformance. The OPP protection triggers immediately once the load is greater\nthan 50.3 A \u2013 and also immediately resets and restarts the PSU when the load\ndrops below 50.2A. It would seem that this platform was initially designed to\nbe significantly more powerful and the OEM \u201cforgot\u201d to adjust the OCP/OPP\ntrigger points.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Eurocom 780W AC adapter melds raw power with innovation, presenting a\npiece that's as formidable as it is intriguing. With its substantial weight\nand metallic edges, it demands respect and caution, especially on delicate\nsurfaces. However, its weight is justified by the impressive power output it\ndelivers, making it a powerhouse that somewhat overshadows its bulky, heavy-\nset design. The inclusion of a display for monitoring performance is a smart\ntouch, though its accuracy leaves room for improvement.\n\nOn the inside, Eurocom doesn't skimp on quality. The adapter's internals are a\ntestament to careful selection and engineering, closely mirroring the\ncomplexity and efficiency of high-end PC PSUs. Its cooling system, though\ncompact, functions well and provides good performance without compromising on\nnoise levels \u2014 at least under most loads. That said, the adapter's noise\nprofile at maximum load might not be everyone's cup of tea, hinting at a\nbalance yet to be perfected between power and tranquility.\n\nOverall, Eurocom's 780W AC adapter boasts commendable efficiency and\nelectrical performance. But as a premium-priced product \u2013 a complete unit and\ncable will set you back at least $429 \u2013 it could benefit from a touch more\nfinesse, particularly in terms of user safety and operational noise at high\nloads. Otherwise, I'm personally a bit surprised that Eurocom isn't offering a\nopen-ended cable for DIY enthusiasts, which could broaden its appeal and\nutility. Such an addition would not only cater to a wider audience but also\nunderscore Eurocom's commitment to versatility and innovation.\n\nIn sum, while the adapter stands out for its power and performance, there's\nalso a clear avenue for Eurocom to enhance its appeal through minor, yet\nimpactful, improvements.\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n  * ### Post Your Comment\n\nPlease log in or sign up to comment.\n\nPOST A COMMENT\n\n## 8 Comments\n\n### View All Comments\n\n  * #### meacupla - Monday, April 22, 2024 - link\n\nI'm surprised they still use MOSFET, when GaN has been around for a while now.\nReply\n\n  * #### GC2:CS - Monday, April 22, 2024 - link\n\nYea. I did notice that GaN is all over the cheap compact adapters for 20 bucks\nfeaturing way smaller overall size than older ones.\n\nBut the big, premium and powerfull stuff ? Good old silicon.\n\nPretty a shame considering how much investment went into GaN.\n\nDoes anybody have an explanation for that ? What is the other side of GaN ?\nReply\n\n  * #### shing3232 - Monday, April 22, 2024 - link\n\nif size is non-issue, then there is not much reason to use GaN Reply\n\n  * #### Silver5urfer - Monday, April 22, 2024 - link\n\nUnfortunately with the death of LGA / MXM based DTRs from Clevo corp. This is\npretty much only useful for their last P870DM line and the other one with the\n10th gen X170SM. X170KM has no unlocked BIOS so it's pretty much useless and\n11th gen is a dud.\n\nAll the other OEMs make BGA computers which barely last 2-3 years. I use an\nAlienware from Haswell era (2014 - 2024, that's 10 years of lifespan and still\nrunning) with an rPGA socket and an MXM slot with Delta 330W Dell PSU and I\nhave faced 3 GPU failures and got a replacement off market and ebay. Now I\nhave a choice to get the P5000 MXM GPU or P5200 all standard 3.0b MXM\nstandard, PnP. Which is identical to a 1080 GPU with 16GB of VRAM.\n\nUltimately nice review but a bit late. As enthusiasts who would buy this moved\non from the Clevo and now use a Desktop as LGA DTR is dead. MXM was alive\nuntil Maxwell, but later on Clevo, MSI slowly started making mutated MXM3.0\ncards which are unusual design and finally with RTX series Turing they all\ndied off. Alienware Area 51 R1 and R2 which used 9th gen were massive failures\ndue to GPU fires and what not, I think they had to use 2x 330W PSUs and this\nEurocom 780W won't work. Reply\n\n  * #### Silver5urfer - Monday, April 22, 2024 - link\n\nFor those who are curious on these DTRs and forum aspects and want to increase\ntheir life and service, they should have known NBR but it was shutdown, a\nreplacement by community was created called notebooktalk, go over there and\nsee how the older non BGA machines still thrive despite their EOL status.\nReply\n\n  * #### drajitshnew - Monday, April 22, 2024 - link\n\nI had a similar experience with a Lenovo with a 45W Haswell. The QC is just\nnot there Reply\n\n  * #### GeoffreyA - Monday, April 22, 2024 - link\n\nInformative, well-written review. Thank you. Reply\n\n  * #### cerberusss - Monday, April 22, 2024 - link\n\nI'd expect some way to connect USB-C.
