I\nwas in my early 30s and he was in his late 50s. He\u2019d been around, worked at\nlots of companies, and had become wise in the ways of corporations and\ntechnology.\n\nWe were working on a doomed project at the time. Everyone on our team knew it.\nThe tech didn\u2019t work, sales couldn\u2019t sell what did work, and office politics\nwere tearing the team apart. The constant topic of conversation in hushed 1:1\nmeetings was how long the business would keep funding what seemed to obviously\nbe a losing bet.\n\nThanks for reading Silicon Ladders.

From a very young age, if something went wrong, I\nassumed it was because of something I had done. When things went right, I\nassumed it was due to someone else or something else. Neurotic? Yes. Difficult\nto rewire my brain? Also yes.\n\nThis tendency to internalize failure had inevitably spilled over into my\ncareer. Here I was, almost a decade into my career, and it felt like none of\nmy products had been super successful. I had begun to wonder if perhaps I was\nthe weak link.\n\n##\n\nThe Revelation\n\nBut over lunch one day, I decided to ask my boss about success in his own\ncareer. \u201cHow many times have you worked on a team that functioned well, with\ntechnology that worked, in a market that actually wanted what you were\nbuilding?\u201d\n\nHe paused, introspected, and then in a nonchalant way said \u201ctwice.\u201d He then\ntook another bite of his lunch as if this answer was to be expected and didn\u2019t\nwarrant further discussion.\n\nI was shocked. This guy\u2019s LinkedIn page looked like a who\u2019s who list of the\nbest-known tech companies of all time. And he hadn\u2019t just been a random\nemployee at these places: he had worked on some really important products and\ntechnologies. And here he was admitting that in 35+ years across dozens of\ncompanies, product launches, teams, managers, and tech stacks, the stars had\nonly ever really aligned for him twice.\n\nThat lunch was a sobering reality check. Up to that point, I had assumed my\nundignified tenure in the tech industry was abnormal. I was sure that everyone\nelse was working with cutting-edge tech, supportive and highly-skilled\ncoworkers, in a fast-growing vertical.\n\n##\n\nA Reality Check\n\nBut if you step back, that definitionally can\u2019t be the case. Companies don\u2019t\npay people to work on solved problems where things are already going well.\nThey pay people to solve new problems, and solving new problems is highly\nprone to failure. If there was no risk, you wouldn\u2019t be paid.\n\nSo, if your project is failing and your team is dysfunctional and the market\ndoesn\u2019t want what you\u2019re building, just remember: what you\u2019re experiencing is\nthe norm. And it\u2019s almost certainly not your fault. Hopefully, this\nrealization will even make you more effective. Whereas previously every little\ndysfunction and failure might have been painful to behold, you can now simply\nexpect them. And, when something goes right, a launch is marginally\nsuccessful, or a coworker acts like an adult, you can think \u201cwow, that exceeds\nmy expectations!\u201d\n\nThanks for reading Silicon Ladders.
