Figures released\nthis week shows the number of vacant houses in Japan has topped 9m.\nPhotograph: Carl Court/Getty Images\n\nJapan\n\n# Akiya houses: why Japan has nine million empty homes\n\nNew figures show nearly 14% of all houses in Japan are empty \u2013 but this real\nestate glut is attracting growing interest from foreigners\n\nGavin Blair in Tokyo\n\nShare\n\nAs the declining population continues to impact Japan\u2019s society and economy,\nthe number of vacant houses has topped nine million \u2013 enough to accommodate\nthe entire population of Australia at three people per dwelling.\n\nGovernment figures released on Tuesday show the number of empty houses, known\nas akiya, as of October 2023 was up by more than half a million since the\nprevious survey in 2018.\n\nAt the root of the issue is rural depopulation combined with many of those who\ninherit such properties being unable or unwilling to live in them, refurbish\nor even demolish them. Cities are not immune though, and there are hundreds of\nthousands of long-term empty houses in urban areas.\n\nThat total figure of vacant homes represents nearly 14% of all houses in\nJapan, though the real number could be higher. The Nomura Research Institute\nestimates there are nearly 11m akiya and that they could account for more than\n30% of houses within a decade.\n\nAn abandoned house on a beach, Uchinada, Ishikawa, Japan. Photograph: Toby\nHoward/Alamy\n\nMore than 4.4m of the properties surveyed are available to rent \u2013 but have\nbeen empty long-term and are mostly away from the main population centres. The\nstatus of more than 3.8 million is unknown and only 330,000 of the 9m were up\nfor sale.\n\nVacant land attracts higher taxes in Japan than land with buildings, adding to\nthe financial burden of knocking down old houses and leading some people to\navoid inheriting properties.\n\nHowever, there is growing interest among foreigners in this glut of empty\nproperties, particularly kominka (traditional) houses as an option for cheap\nand unusual accommodation, holiday homes or to rent out to tourists.\n\nHana Sakata and her husband have been renovating and renting out houses for\nalmost a decade through their New Heritage venture, beginning with a holiday\nhome on the Izu peninsula that had lain vacant and fallen into utter\ndisrepair. They acquired a traditional kominka house in a village in\nmountainous Nagano after part of it collapsed under the weight of uncleared\nsnow while its elderly owner was in a care facility.\n\nAn empty house in Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan. Photograph: Toby Howard/Alamy\n\nHowever, the cost of restoring such properties to their former glory is\nenormous, warns Sakata, who is still grappling with the kominka project.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of hype now, particularly among foreigners, about these\ngigantic farmhouses in Japan being available very cheaply or free. But it\u2019s a\nhuge commitment and there aren\u2019t many contractors that can fix them up \u2013 the\ntraditional carpentry skills are dying out,\u201d she says. \u201cIn 10 years we could\nsee a lot of foreign-owned akiya.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, interest among foreign tourists in experiencing a stay in\ntraditional Japanese accommodation is high, with demand currently outstripping\nsupply, notes Sakata.\n\nThe yen being at multi-decade lows against major currencies has helped drive a\ntourism boom, with a record 3 million overseas visitors in March.\n\nJapan is far from the only nation grappling with demographic fallout. In\nneighbouring South Korea the birthrate per woman fell to a record low of 0.72\nlast year, well below even the 1.26 figure Japan logged in 2022. Both\nSingapore and Taiwan have also dropped below one child per woman, while\nfertility rates in the US are also at their lowest in a century.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Japan\n  * Asia Pacific\n  * Housing\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
