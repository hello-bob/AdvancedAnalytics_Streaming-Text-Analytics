I myself was originally with Bell Labs before moving to corporate AT&T\nat Basking Ridge, NJ, in 1980.\n\nThe project management teams were working on exciting new areas of product\ndevelopment... telemedicine, video conference meetings, Audix voicemail\nsystems for businesses, advanced fax technology, video compression, human\nfactors research. Several PhDs at the labs were growing RGB crystals for flat\nscreen TVs. It was all revolutionary stuff.\n\nA young team of six people, including me, were charged with developing\nleading-edge new business services (as opposed to consumer services). I was\nProduct Manager for the Picturephone Meeting Service, one of the key areas\nwhere we saw AT&T having a dominant future.\n\nWe at Corporate did all the research in specific markets of video\nconferencing, voicemail, messaging, security, and even RFID tracking.\nFinancial business cases were developed, and the labs were funded to build the\nproducts and services.\n\nIt was akin to being at Xerox PARC or at Palo Alto Research Park. I visited\nall of them. We were well on our way to making these applications commercial\nusing the latest Bell Labs research and technology.\n\nIn the mid-Eighties, AT&T was offered the chance to sponsor Spaceship Earth at\nDisney\u2019s EPCOT Center, showcasing some of our applications. When it launched,\nEPCOT demonstrated the appeal of AT&T\u2019s technology vision. Millions of\nvisitors saw it and were excited by its near-term realization.\n\nBy 1993, the products we had in mind were not quite ready for prime time\u2014the\nquality they needed to be at for widespread market adoption was not there yet,\nand affordability would also have been a factor. But in reality, the concepts\nwere good, the core technology was real, and we just needed to wait for\nMoore\u2019s law and Internet adoption to catch up for us to properly commercialize\nthem.\n\nSo, you might ask, why go to air with these commercials about still-in-\ndevelopment applications?\n\nWe were slipping in a critical area. Consumer technology was rapidly being\noverwhelmed by companies like Sony and Panasonic in areas of video and music\nand computing. That led to subsequent consumer research showing AT&T was\nlosing the public perception battle across a number of tech attributes,\nincluding \u201cmost likely to bring new technology to the lives of 18\u201334 year-\nolds\u201d.\n\nAT&T brand marketing felt like it had to rebuild its image. Using the feedback\nfrom EPCOT and the applications that received such positive consumer response,\nwe launched an advertising plan to promote a new image of AT&T, even\nintroducing a new globe logo. A meeting was called with N.W. Ayer & Son, our\nlong-standing lead agency of record.\n\nThe new \u201cYou Will\u201d campaign began to take shape, using our vision of the\nfuture.\n\nThe aim of this advertising initiative was clear: To project a more relevant\nAT&T to the youth demographic, and build enthusiasm for what we had in the\npipeline.\n\nWe picked all of the applications and technology that we thought were both\nrealistic and would create interest for consumers. Apart from the \u201cYou Will\u201d\nsignoff that most people remember from the commercials today, there was a\nsecond tagline we used in some of our advertising: \u201cMore than you imagine, and\nsooner than you think.\u201d I loved that line.\n\nIt was a massive campaign, and the team at Ayer was appropriately huge. They\nhad different project leaders for content, creative and video production, and\neven market research testing.\n\nDavid Fincher, whose Hollywood directorial debut Alien 3 had recently earned\nan Oscar nomination for visual effects, was picked to direct the commercials.\n\nThe initial cut of the ad had actor Robin Williams providing the voice. In\ntests, it did okay, but not great. The agency then switched to Tom Selleck,\nwhich proved to be a dramatic improvement.\n\nWhile I\u2019m not aware of the specifics of the video development and the\nscripting\u2014Ayer was based in New York while I was back at headquarters in\nBasking Ridge, working to get Picturephone deployed\u2014I did have daily\nconference calls with the agency, going over technical insights, applications,\netc.\n\nApart from the commercials, we also had radio and print in the mix, and would\nalong the way have the very first banner ad on the internet (or at least one\nof six, on Hotwired.com). Here are some of the commercials, one of the print\nads and the internet\u2019s first banner ad (it was believed to have had a 44%\nclickthrough ratio, with visitors taken to a You Will microsite).\n\nEven before it launched, it was clear from focus group tests that this\ncampaign was going to be a memorable one. But through all these years, there\nwas one remark made that has stayed with me. A young friend of mine, a\ncomputer science student, mentioned that he had seen the commercials and was\nreally intrigued.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d he asked me, \u201chow can we trust that AT&T will really do all of this?\u201d\n\nI have thought about that question many times. It is one thing to make a great\ncommercial but it is quite another to make a great promise and keep it.\n\nUnfortunately, two things conspired to work against us:\n\nOne, the emergence and widespread adoption of the internet arrived just a\nlittle too late for us to push our products out at prices that the market\nwould bear.\n\nAnd two, a second breakup (after the big one that created seven Baby Bells in\n1984) resulted in AT&T spinning off Bell Labs and its equipment manufacturing\nbusiness in 1995.\n\nWe had technology and applications that were before their time, and now were\nleft without the ability to commercialize them.\n\nEventually it was left to Intel, Cisco, Microsoft, Apple, and many other\ncompanies who stepped up and brought these technologies to consumers; leaving\nAT&T behind.\n\nPost-script: After the breakup, AT&T entered the ISP business which was\nevolving quickly with the spread of the internet. I was one of the original\nproduct managers of AT&T\u2019s WorldNet internet service. We rose from being a\nnon-player to the No. 2 ISP within the space of a year.\n\nThose who were around in 1994\u201395 will recall that AOL charged $20/month for 12\nhours of dial-up service at the time. We came up with the concept of unlimited\nservice for the exact same price. It was a huge hit. The internet was never\nthe same since then.\n\nIt\u2019s good to win some battles!\n\nThis question originally appeared on Quora - the place to gain and share\nknowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the\nworld.
