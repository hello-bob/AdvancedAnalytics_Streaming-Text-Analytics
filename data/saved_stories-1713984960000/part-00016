We applaud the rules on reasonable prices for\noriginal parts as well as the ban of software practices which prevent\nindependent repair and the use of compatible and reused spare parts. This is a\nstep in the right direction for affordable repair.\n\nHowever, we must note that with the adoption of the law, a major chance is\nbeing missed to create a truly fair repair market in Europe and to ensure\naffordable repair solutions for the majority of products on the European\nmarket. We regret that the scope of products covered remains very narrow and\nthat many loopholes were introduced. We call for a swift implementation of\nthese rules, including Commission guidelines on the definition of \u201creasonable\u201d\nprices for spare parts, a solid execution of the ban on anti-repair practices\nand the introduction of national financial incentives for repair by EU Member\nStates.\n\nEU countries will have two years to incorporate this directive into their\nnational legislation.\n\nWe urge the next EU Commission (post-EU elections in June 2024) to continue\nworking on legal acts setting repairability requirements^(2) for additional\nproduct categories to swiftly expand the scope of these new repair rules.\n\n1\\. Better access to repair for a selection of products The new rules will be\nset to improve European consumers\u2019 access to repair for a selection of\nproducts. The scope is limited to goods purchased by consumers (neither\nbusiness-to-business nor industrial goods are covered) and to products already\ncovered by repairability requirements under EU law. Presently, this means\nwashing machines, tumble dryers, dishwashers, fridges, TVs, welders, vacuum\ncleaners, servers, phones, tablets and the batteries of light means of\ntransport (such as e-bikes and e-scooters). The scope will automatically be\nexpanded by the European Commission within 12 months after the adoption of any\nnew legal acts setting repairability requirements (i.e. not limited to\nEcodesign).\n\n1.a. Obligation for manufacturers to repair beyond the legal guarantee period\nWe welcome that producers will for the first time be required to offer repair\noptions beyond the legal guarantee period of two years, for a duration of up\nto 10 years depending on the product. These repairs will need to be carried\nout by the producers (or via their sub-contracted operators) for free or\nagainst a \u201creasonable price\u201d. Consumers may be offered a replacement product\nduring the repair period.\n\n1.b. Fairer access to spare parts for independent repairers We applaud that\nparts and tools (insofar as available per other legislative requirements) need\nto be sold to independent repairers \u201cat a reasonable price that does not deter\nrepair\u201d. Despite our demands, the rules do not provide any indication of what\na \u201creasonable\u201d part price actually means. The European Commission should draw\nup guidelines on the precise meaning of appropriate spare parts prices in\norder to facilitate the implementation of this requirement for all\nstakeholders involved. Otherwise, we will need to wait for national courts to\nestablish its definition through legal cases. It will be crucial for the\nrepair movement, including consumer organisations and the independent repair\nsector, to seize this legal tool and take manufacturers that sell spare parts\nat unreasonably high prices to court. You can consult our work on spare part\nprices here. In short: most people will only consider a repair if the total\ncost of the repair is less than 30\u201340% of the product value.^(3) Given that\nthe cost of any given repair is usually composed of labour cost and spare\nparts cost (assuming there is no transportation cost for the repairer), in\norder for the repair to stay below the critical threshold, it is reasonable to\nestimate that the price of spare parts should stay below 15-20% of the product\nprice.^(4) Regrettably, the current law also fails to offer broader access to\nmore repair information and more spare parts. We furthermore celebrate the ban\non \u201ccontractual clauses, hardware or software techniques that impede the\nrepair\u201d for the products in scope. Our campaign worked persistently to bring\nthese unfair practices to the policymakers\u2019 attention. However, it remains to\nbe seen to what extent loopholes will persist, as the text adds the following\nvague exemption to the ban: \u201cunless justified by legitimate and objective\nfactors including the protection of intellectual property rights under Union\nand national legal acts\u201d. This exemption is very blurry and it leaves the door\nopen for manufacturers to continue enacting unfair anti-repair practices, just\nstating it is \u201clegitimate\u201d.\n\n2\\. Improved attractivity of repair under the legal guarantee To improve the\nattractivity of repair (vis-\u00e0-vis replacement) under the legal guarantee, we\nwelcome that the guarantee will be extended by 12 months if consumers opt for\nrepair. This will result in a total of 3-year legal guarantee coverage in most\nEU countries, while there is no extension if consumers opt for replacement.\nSellers will be required to inform consumers of the choice between repair and\nreplacement and of the guarantee extension in case of repair. Refurbished\ngoods may be provided as replacements upon explicit request from the consumer.\n\n3\\. One step closer to national financial incentives for repair \u2013 but we still\nneed to make it happen EU lawmakers also require Member States to implement at\nleast one national measure promoting repair. They propose a non-binding\nlist^(5) of financial and non-financial options such as support to community-\nled repair initiatives or information campaigns. Among financial measures, EU\nlawmakers propose the financing of training programs to acquire special skills\nin repair or national repair vouchers/funds. The latter schemes have already\nproven successful as a viable strategy to improve repair affordability and to\ncreate local jobs in Austria, Germany and France.\n\nEU lawmakers also remind^(6) national authorities that the EU framework\nalready allows Member States to apply a reduced value-added tax (VAT) on\nrepair services of household appliances, shoes and leather goods, clothing and\nhousehold linen. Despite this, to date only 7 member states have been\nexperimenting with reduced VAT for repair services.\n\nNeedless to say that during the two years of transposition of this directive\ninto national legislation, it will be crucial for the right to repair movement\nto keep up the momentum via national campaigns and knowledge sharing on\nsuccessful national initiatives. Based on data we collected so far, it is\nessential that financial incentives for repair are introduced in all\ncountries.\n\n4\\. Online matchmaking platform and European repair form The EU Commission\nwill introduce a European online platform listing repair and buyback solutions\nin Member States and harmonised cost estimations, with the aim to increase the\nvisibility of repair options and transparency for their costs.\n\nUpon consumers\u2019 request, repairers may choose to submit a harmonised repair\nquote/estimation called the \u201cEuropean Repair Information Form\u201d, including\nbinding information such as the type or repair suggested and its price or, if\nthe precise cost cannot be calculated, the applicable calculation method and\nmaximum price of repair.\n\nWhile it is generally a good idea to increase the visibility of repair\nservices and make it easier for consumers to find suitable service providers,\nthis will only be effective as long as there is an adequate repair\ninfrastructure that is also visible on the platform. Widespread coverage of\nrepair service providers across Europe will only be realised by improving the\nconditions for independent repairers, i.e. by implementing the above mentioned\naspects of the directive relating to reasonable spare parts prices and the ban\non software blocking and creating a fair repair market.\n\n5\\. Missed opportunities\n\nConsidering the limited scope and ambition, we feel that the opportunity was\nmissed to make this initiative into something that would actually merit the\ntitle \u2018Right to repair directive\u2019. As things stand, this piece of regulation\ncould be more aptly described as an \u2018annex to the existing ecodesign\nregulations.\u2019 In essence, its main effect will be to somewhat increase the\nchances that the small number of products that already had to be repairable by\nlaw anyway, will actually end up being repaired.\n\nGiven that it does not, nor will in the foreseeable future, apply to the vast\nmajority of short-lived products flooding the EU market,^(7) it would be very\noptimistic indeed to expect that these measures will make a dent in the use of\nresources and the production of e-waste.\n\nThe list of missed opportunities is long. For example, in order for the\nguarantee to actually prolong the life of products, we had suggested a\nmandatory priority for repair over replacement under the guarantee along with\nstrengthening the independent repair sector by allowing them to perform\nrepairs under the guarantee. While giving priority to repair rather than\nreplacement within the legal guarantee was included in the original proposal\nby the Commission, it didn\u2019t make it through negotiations, and our proposal\nfor in-guarantee repairs to be performed by independent repairers didn\u2019t make\nit either.\n\nThere are also many ambitious provisions which the Parliament had agreed upon\nafter extensive internal negotiations, only for them to be thrown out in\nfavour of the Council\u2019s drastically less ambitious stance during the\ntrialogues:\n\n\u2013 The right for the consumer to make a guarantee claim directly to the\nproducer;\n\n\u2013 The right for the consumer to choose for the producer to repair a good that\nis not in conformity, with any terms of a commercial guarantee that discourage\nthe consumer from making use of this right being void;\n\n\u2013 The right for the consumer to have a product repaired unless this is\nfactually or legally impossible (with the producer not allowed to refuse the\nconsumer\u2019s request purely due to economic considerations such as the costs);\n\n\u2013 The right for independent repairers, remanufacturers, refurbishers and end-\nusers to have access to all spare parts and all repair-related information and\ntools, including diagnosis tools for a period corresponding to at least the\nexpected lifespan of the product;\n\n\u2013 The obligation for producers to publish all information related to repair\n(such as repair prices and prices of spare parts) on their websites;\n\n\u2013 The possibility for legislators to add products to the list even if not\ncovered by Ecodesign or other requirements.\n\nWe find it quite regrettable that in the end, the voice of our democratically\nelected representatives did not prevail. Our coalition will continue to push\nfor ambitious repairability requirements for as many additional product\ncategories as possible, as well as working with members focused on the\nimplementation of the directive in each member state, to ensure that this and\nother pieces of legislation actually make a difference for European consumers\nand for the prevention of e-waste.\n\nContact Cristina Ganapini Coordinator of Right to Repair Europe Email:\ninfo@repair.eu\n\nNotes\n\n(1) legal text of the directive (2) EU lawmakers also agreed on a new EU\nEcodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR). This framework\nregulation will enable the EU Commission to set minimum repairability\nrequirements for further product categories. Our coalition managed to put\nenergy-related products, ICT products and other electronics as part of their\nnext priorities. (3) Deloitte quoted 30% for French consumers and 30-40% for\nSwedish consumers (presentation from Expert workshop towards increased repair\nof household EEE (Brussels, 2017), p. 48-49). This may be a high estimate:\naccording to Sahra Svensson-Hoglund ea., Barriers, enablers and market\ngovernance: A review of the policy landscape for repair of consumer\nelectronics in the EU and the U.S. (2021), \u201cgenerally, the willingness to pay\nfor repairs of small electronics has been estimated to be 20% of the\nreplacement cost\u201d (p. 6, citing McCollough (2007)). See also the European\nCommission\u2019s Behavioural Study on Consumers\u2019 Engagement in the Circular\nEconomy (October 2018). (4) This threshold is proposed in Florent Curel e.a.,\nGuide pratique: Rendre la r\u00e9paration accessible (Club de la durabilit\u00e9, 2023),\np. 4. (5) Member States\u2019 measures promoting repair can include information\ncampaigns, support to community-led repair initiatives, repair vouchers,\nrepair funds, supporting or creating local or regional repair platforms,\norganising or financing training programs to acquire special skills in repair\nand taxation measures. These measures can be taken at a national, regional or\nlocal level. (6) The French Minister Christophe B\u00e9chu already advocates\nlowering VAT rates and argues that the measure could bring several billion\neuros back into the state coffers. (7) To name just a few categories of\nelectric and electronic products not covered: appliances such as heaters,\nwater heaters, air conditioners and fans; domestic systems such as lighting,\nsolar energy systems, home automation, routers, and security systems; small\nhousehold and kitchen appliances such as such a clothes irons, coffee\nmachines, kettles, toasters, fryers, grills, juicers, blenders, and mixers;\nentertainment products such as set top boxes, game consoles, e-readers, toys,\nand drones; music products such as digital media players, headphones, earbuds,\nspeakers, and amplifiers; personal hygiene products such as hair dryers,\nelectric toothbrushes, shavers, trimmers, and epilators; DIY products such as\ndrills, saws, and sanders; garden tools such as lawnmowers, hedge trimmers,\nchainsaws, and shredders. And unfortunately the list goes on and on.\n\n##### Join the movement!\n\nSign up for updates from the campaign.\n\n##### Help us bring the Right to Repair to Europe!\n\nSupport the campaign.\n\n## More news\n\n9 April 2024\n\n### We are looking for a Right to Repair Trainee!
