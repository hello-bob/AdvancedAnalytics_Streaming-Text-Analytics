Azerbaijan,\nPakistan and Belarus joined the project in October 2023. Credit:\nCNSA/Roscosmos\n\nHELSINKI \u2014 China is on target to reach its goal of putting its astronauts on\nthe moon before the end of the decade, according to the country\u2019s human\nspaceflight agency.\n\nOfficials with the China Manned Space Engineering Office (CMSEO) provided a\nrare update on the crewed lunar program during a press conference at Jiuquan\nspaceport April 24.\n\n\u201cThe program development for major flight products, including the Long March\n10 rocket, the Mengzhou crew spacecraft, the lunar lander Lanyue and the lunar\nlanding suits, are all complete,\u201d said Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of CMSEO.\n\u201cTheir prototype production and tests are in full swing.\u201d\n\nChinese officials previously announced a plan to put a pair of astronauts on\nthe moon before 2030. Two Long March 10 lunar variant rockets will separately\nlaunch Mengzhou and three astronauts and the Lanyue lander. The pair will then\nperform a lunar orbit rendezvous and docking ahead of descent to the lunar\nsurface. Two astronauts will spend six hours on the lunar surface before\nrejoining their colleague in lunar orbit and returning to Earth.\n\n\u201cThe development of mechanical and thermal test products for the crew\nspacecraft and lander have been basically completed. Various rocket engines\nare undergoing hotfire tests, and the Wenchang crewed lunar exploration launch\nsite is under construction,\u201d Lin said.\n\nNew launch infrastructure is required to facilitate the missions. This is\nbeing built near China\u2019s existing coastal spaceport at Wenchang, Hainan\nisland.\n\n> CMSE: China's crewed lunar missions are underway, and everything is in plan.\n> Two Chinese astronauts will land on the Moon in 2029 #CNSA\n> pic.twitter.com/PcMs69LBP3\n>\n> \u2014 Yuqi Qian (@YuqiiQian) February 26, 2023\n\nFurthermore, proposals for a \u201ccrew lunar rover and lunar surface payloads\nsolicited from the public are under selection,\u201d Lin stated. CMSA announced a\ncall for proposals for a lunar crew rover, potentially using a commercial\ndevelopment model, in May 2023.\n\nLin added that astronaut training for the mission includes mastering operation\nof the Mengzhou and Lanyue spacecraft, including in normal and emergency\nflight conditions. Rendezvous and docking and manually avoiding obstacles\nduring the lander\u2019s descent were noted as part of the training. Other\nactivities include entering and exiting the lander, working in one-sixth of\nEarth\u2019s gravity, long-range lunar roving, drilling, sampling and other\nscientific work on the lunar surface.\n\nThe crewed lunar landing mission is part of China\u2019s wider plans to establish a\nrobotic and eventually inhabited moon base. The initiative is known as the\nInternational Lunar Research Station (ILRS).\n\n> China's lunar exploration blueprint: \u2013 Queqiao-2 (March) \u2013 CE-6 (May) \u2013 CE-7\n> (~2026) \u2013 CE-8 (~2028) \u2013 Crewed lunar landing before 2030 \u2013 ILRS moon base\n> in 2030s \u2013 Queqiao constellation (Tiandu test satellites launching soon)\n> pic.twitter.com/4IdwjLcFvt\n>\n> \u2014 Andrew Jones (@AJ_FI) February 21, 2024\n\nLin stated that a human lunar landing is a challenging and innovative\nscientific and technological project. He said efforts will be made to progress\nwith the development and manufacturing in a coordinated way to fulfill the\nmission as scheduled.\n\nThe U.S. meanwhile is working towards returning humans to the moon with its\nArtemis 3 mission. That mission, earlier scheduled for late 2025 was\nofficially delayed to no earlier than September 2026 in January this year. A\nreport by the Government Accountability Office in December 2023 concluded that\nthe mission was unlikely to happen before 2027.\n\nThe CMSEO press event\u2014held on China\u2019s national space day\u2014was primarily to\nunveil the crew for the Shenzhou-18 mission. That mission is due to launch at\n8:59 a.m. (1259 UTC) April 25, reaching Tiangong space station around 6.5\nhours later.\n\nThe crew will be commanded by Ye Guangfu, veteran of the 2021 Shenzhou-13\nmission. Completing the crew will be former PLA Air Force pilots Li Guangsu\nand Li Cong. The latter pair will be embarking on their first spaceflight\nmissions.\n\n### Related\n\n#### China\u2019s Shenzhou-18 crew arrive at Tiangong space station\n\nChina\u2019s three Shenzhou-18 mission astronauts arrived at the Tiangong space\nstation Thursday following launch from Jiuquan spaceport.\n\n#### China rolls out rocket for Shenzhou-17 mission to Tiangong\n\nA crew of three astronauts is set to launch to China\u2019s Tiangong space station\nnext week for a six-month-long mission.\n\n#### China\u2019s commercial launch firms get space station cargo boost\n\nChina\u2019s human spaceflight agency says the country\u2019s commercial rocket\ncompanies could launch low-cost cargo missions in the future.\n\nTagged: China, ILRS, Long March 10, Moon\n\n## Andrew Jones\n\nAndrew Jones covers China's space industry for SpaceNews.
