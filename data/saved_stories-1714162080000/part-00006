Infocom\ncompiled game code to files containing Z-machine instructions (called story\nfiles or Z-code files) and could therefore port its text adventures to a new\nplatform simply by writing a Z-machine implementation for that platform. With\nthe large number of incompatible home computer systems in use at the time,\nthis was an important advantage over using native code or developing a\ncompiler for each system.\n\n## History[edit]\n\nThe \"Z\" of Z-machine stands for Zork, Infocom's first adventure game. Z-code\nfiles usually have names ending in .z1, .z2, .z3, .z4, .z5, .z6, .z7, or .z8,\nwhere the number is the version number of the Z-machine on which the file is\nintended to be run, as given by the first byte of the story file.^[1]\n\nThis is a modern convention, however. Infocom itself used extensions of .dat\n(Data) and .zip (ZIP = Z-machine Interpreter Program), but the latter clashed\nwith the widespread use of .zip for PKZIP-compatible archive files starting in\nthe 1990s, after Activision closed Infocom. Infocom produced six versions of\nthe Z-machine. Files using versions 1 and 2 are very rare. Only two version 1\nfiles are known to have been released by Infocom and only two of version 2.\nVersion 3 covers the majority of Infocom's released games. Later versions had\nmore capabilities, culminating in some graphic support in version 6.\n\nThe compiler (called Zilch) that Infocom used to produce its story files has\nnever been released, although documentation of the language used called ZIL, a\nLisp-family language similar to MDL, still exists, and an open-source\nreplacement \"ZILF\"^[2] has been written. After Mediagenic moved Infocom to\nCalifornia in 1989, Computer Gaming World stated that \"ZIL ... is functionally\ndead\", and reported rumors of a \"completely new parser that may never be\nused\".^[3] In May 1993, Graham Nelson released the first version of his Inform\ncompiler, which also generates Z-machine story files as its output, even\nthough the Inform source language is quite different from ZIL.\n\nInform has become popular in the interactive fiction community. A large\nproportion of interactive fiction is in the form of Z-machine story files.\nDemand for the ability to create larger game files led Nelson to specify\nversions 7 and 8 of the Z-machine, though version 7 is rarely used. Because of\nthe way addresses are handled, a version 3 story file can be up to 128K in\nlength, a version 5 story can be up to 256K in length, and a version 8 story\ncan be up to 512k in length. Though these sizes may seem small by today's\ncomputing standards, for text-only adventures, these are large enough for\nelaborate games.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Graham Nelson drew up a Z-Machine Standard based on detailed\nstudies of the existing Infocom files. The standard also includes extensions\nused by his newer versions, as well as links to the \"Blorb\" resource format\nused by Infocom, and a \"Quetzal\" savefile format.^[4] In 2006, Nelson expanded\nZ-machine to the 32-bit Glulx format for Inform 7. The Interactive Fiction\nTechnology Foundation, founded 2016, manages all these standards.^[5]\n\n## ZIL (Zork Implementation Language)[edit]\n\nThe ZIL is based on MDL from MIT. Here is the definition of Zork I's brass\nlantern:\n\n    \n    \n    <OBJECT LANTERN (LOC LIVING-ROOM) (SYNONYM LAMP LANTERN LIGHT) (ADJECTIVE BRASS) (DESC \"brass lantern\") (FLAGS TAKEBIT LIGHTBIT) (ACTION LANTERN-F) (FDESC \"A battery-powered lantern is on the trophy case.\") (LDESC \"There is a brass lantern (battery-powered) here.\") (SIZE 15)>\n\nA more complex example involving combat, along with its MDL Zork equivalent,\nis presented in an 2019 blog post by Andrew Plotkin. Notably, the Z-machine\nhas no support for garbage collection and ZIL has no concept of Lisp's list\nsystem.^[6]\n\n## Interpreters[edit]\n\nAn implementation of Frotz running on an iPhone, playing the MIT version of\nZork.\n\nInterpreters for Z-code files are available on a wide variety of platforms.\nThe Inform website lists links to freely available interpreters for 15 desktop\noperating systems (including 8-bit microcomputers from the 1980s such as the\nApple II, TRS-80, and ZX Spectrum, and grouping \"Unix\" and \"Windows\" as one\neach), 10 mobile operating systems (including Palm OS and the Game Boy), and\nfour interpreter platforms (Emacs, Java, JavaScript, and Scratch). According\nto Nelson, it is \"possibly the most portable virtual machine ever\ncreated\".^[7]\n\nPopular interpreters include Nitfol and Frotz. Nitfol makes use of the Glk\nAPI, and supports versions 1 through 8 of the Z-machine, including the version\n6 graphical Z-machine. Save files are stored in the standard Quetzal save\nformat. Binary files are available for several different operating systems,\nincluding the classic Mac OS, Unix-like systems, DOS, and Windows.^[8]\n\nFrotz was written in C by Stefan Jokisch in 1995 for DOS. Over time it was\nported to other platforms, such as Unix-like systems,^[9] RISC OS,^[10] and\niOS.^[11] Sound effects and graphics were supported to varying degrees. By\n2002, development stalled and the program was picked up by David Griffith. The\ncode base was split between virtual machine and user interface portions in\nsuch a way that the virtual machine became independent from any user\ninterface. This allowed more variety in porting Frotz. One of the stranger\nports is also one of the simplest: an instant messaging bot is wrapped around\na version of Frotz with the minimum I/O functionality creating a bot with\nwhich one can play most Z-machine games using an instant messaging\nclient.^[12]\n\nAnother popular client for macOS and other Unix-like systems is Zoom.^[13] It\nsupports the same Quetzal save-format, but the packaging of the file-structure\nis different.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Glulx \u2013 Similar to the Z-machine, but relieves several legacy limitations\n  * Inform \u2013 A computer language that can produce Z-machine programs\n  * SCUMM \u2013 Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion by LucasArts, a graphical system similar to Z-machine\n  * TADS \u2013 Like Glulx, made to address some of its limitations\n  * Motorola 68000 series \u2013 The base architecture used for virtual machines in Magnetic Scrolls' adventure games\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"The Z-Machine Standards Document\". inform-fiction.org.
