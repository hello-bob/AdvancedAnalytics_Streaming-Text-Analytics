Why?\n\nWriting Software is not a manufacturing process. It is not about \u201cproducing\u201d\nanything. The written code is a byproduct. Software Engineering is a design\nprocess, the essential design process of solving problems and building a\nproduct.\n\nSoftware engineers discover their real tasks only by starting to do real work.\nSometimes, they even discover something that prohibits or boosts the value\nprovided to the user.\n\nSo, empowered engineers in a product team must be part of the discovery and\nshaping phases. They are front and central to problem-solving. They are\nclosest to the tech and, therefore, to the tech solution.\n\nWhen coding becomes a task divorced from the broader vision, it\u2019s no more\ninnovative than painting by numbers. You don\u2019t need an artist for that. Even\nworse, engineers who work too long in a \u201cjust give me my tickets with\nacceptance criteria\u201d mindset eventually stop thinking. For them, it becomes\nmore important to have hourlong refinement sessions to discuss and complain\nthan to solve a customer\u2019s problem.\n\nInsourced engineers pay for themself, manifold.\n\nIf the engineers\u2019 proximity to the problem space is removed, their lever is\nremoved. Even worse, any chance of building a successful product team is\nremoved.\n\nNot even \u201cagile\u201d can help then.\n\n  * Published On: 2024-04-26\n  * Want to leave a public comment?
