(Courtesy US GPO)\n\nThe following query appeared on this site recently:\n\nPlease, I would like to know the term used for the \u201cthumb indents\u201d found in\nolder hardbound dictionaries, one at the start of each new letter. Also, was\nmaking these indents considered part of the binding process, and how was it\naccomplished?\n\nThe proper term is \u201cthumb indexes\u201d and there were, and are, machines that cut\nthe indentations. A tab or label with the appropriate letter or title is then\naffixed. It is a bindery operation.\n\nThe U.S. Government Publishing Office (formerly the Government Printing\nOffice), operated a mind-boggling array of equipment in the early twentieth-\ncentury. By 1942, GPO\u2019s catalog of machinery listed eight indexing machines by\nthree manufacturers. In the 1980 catalog, seven machines were listed, although\nsome of those are for cutting strip indexes rather than thumb indexes. The\nphoto above shows workers in the Bindery operating indexing machines, about\n1905.\n\nGPO\u2019s apprentice school published its own textbooks throughout most of the\ntwentieth-century. The chapter \u201cMiscellaneous: Rounding Corners, Indexing,\nNumbering \u201d in the textbook Theory and Practice of Bookbinding (1950) gives\nthe following summary of fore edge indexing:\n\nThree kinds of index are in general use. One is the cut-in or strip index, in\nwhich a strip is removed from the margin of the page leaving a portion of the\nmargin upon which the index number or letter is printed. Another is the thumb\nindex which is a semicircular indention cut in the page margins. Another is\nthe tab index which consists of numbered or lettered tabs pasted to the page\nmargins. Indexes for reference books usually are of the thumb or the tab\nvariety, while account books generally have cut-in indexes or occasionally tab\nindexes.\n\nTo machine cut a cut-in index, the guide on the machine is set for the depth\nof the cut and the ratchet is set to space the divisions. The book is fastened\nin the clamp and the operator lets the pages fall on the cutting blade. As\neach division is cut, the machine shifts the book along for the next cut.\n\nThe cut-in index can be cut by hand also. The divisions are marked off on the\npages and index shears are used to cut in at each division mark. Index shears\nare equipped with an adjustable gage to cut to the desired depth. A cutting\nzinc is inserted between the first and the second divisions. A straightedge\nand knife are used to cut parallel to the fore edge through the first division\nfrom the shear cut to the tail of the page. The other divisions are cut in the\nsame manner. The letters are then marked on the divisions by hand with ink.An\nindexing roll with the alphabet on its edge should be used if much work of one\nsize is to be indexed. The spacing between letters corresponds to the spacing\nbetween divisions of the index so that the entire index can be imprinted by\nrunning the roll along the index divisions. The cut-in index can be reinforced\nby means of a piece of heavy paper, cloth, or leather folded around that\nportion of the margin that carries the index letter. This should be done\nbefore the index Is cut so that the blade will cut the reinforcing material\nwith the page.\n\nThe thumb index is cut with a semicircular cutter. One kind of cutter\nresembles a pair of pliers and is operated by hand, and another is operated by\ncompressed air. The Index divisions are marked and the cutting plate is\nslipped between the pages on top of the first division page. The book is\nforced back so that the fore edge is at an angle and the thumb notch is cut.\nThe division letters or numbers are stamped on semicircular pieces of\nreinforcing material such as cloth or leather, slightly larger than the thumb\nnotch. They are pasted on the division pages directly under the notch, which\nmay be colored by the use of edge colors applied with a small brush. If the\nbook edges are to be marbled, the marbling should be applied before the index\nis cut.\n\nThumb indexes can be cut by hand by the use of a half-round chisel of the\nproper size. A piece of binder\u2019s board for the chisel to cut against should be\nplaced in the book at the division page. This is a slow process and is\nsuitable only for occasional use.\n\nSome of GPO\u2019s fine work for Congress still requires thumb indexes. A hand-held\ndevice has replaced the large models in the photo. We produced a video about\nthe binding of Jefferson\u2019s Manual a few years ago, which walks through the\nprocess of binding an edition of the manual in leather, including the cutting\nof the thumb indexes. The link is to a short clip of that process.\n\n### Comments\n\n  1. Barbre Brunson 23 February, 2018 at 6:51 am\n\nI found this fascinating. As the Historian of Bills for many years I have seen\na lot of changes. We indexed on carbon index cards and sent those to GPO\ntypesetters. Thumb Index methods, like our use of computers today, is\ndefinitely different. I enjoy looking at the old pictures of GPO workers and\nthe equipment they used.\n\nReply\n\n  2.

Steven Edward Grissom 24 September, 2019 at 11:29 am\n\nI have been looking for a type of bible thumb indexing that indexed all the\nway down to chapter if not verse. I had a bible cut this way at one time and\nwas told there were only a couple of machines left that do it and only one\nworked. That bible became my sons bible as a hand me down 15 yrs ago. Now it\nhas black mold on it and we will have to get another but he wants it exactly\nthe same as it has emotional value to him. Please help, I don\u2019t even know\nwhere to begin this search for someone that can do it or has the machine but I\nthought you may have a better idea than me.\n\nReply\n\n  4. George Barnum 25 September, 2019 at 9:50 am\n\nMr. Grissom: I don\u2019t think I have any direct suggestion, although someone else\nmay respond here. You might consider posting a query to Briar Press\n(www.briarpress.org), an active discussion forum made up of many working\nprinters, some of whom might have an idea. Alternatively, a bookbinder with\nexperience in restoration might also have suggestions about the mold problem.\nThe organization for hand bookbinders is called the Guild of Bookworkers\n(https://guildofbookworkers.org). Best of luck.\n\nReply\n\n  5. jeffrey s carlson 4 September, 2021 at 4:13 pm\n\nI have a Rhema study bible.. that is thumb indexed but some of the tabs have\nbeen lost.. the only problem I have in finding replacement half moon tabs.. is\nthat.. it appears this bible was NOT indexed in the usual way.. in that the NT\ntabs follow the usual way of indexing.. but the old Testament tabs.. are not\nfacing the same direction..the O.T tabs are facing as if face to face to the\nN.T. tabs.. it appears when this bible was indexed that the indexers turned\nthe bible over with its front side facing down to do all the tabs for the Old\ntestament.. so the tabs for the O.T. begin with the lettering on the arch side\nNot the flat side of the half moon..the O.T. tabs are used with the left thumb\nand the N.T. tabs are used with the right thumb...any answers as to how I can\nfind O.T. replacement tabs for this with the wording facing properly.. in\naccordance to the tab location?...\n\nReply\n\n  6.

Darwin Tims 13 February, 2024 at 12:15 pm\n\nCan you give me information on where can I send an existing bible to have it\nthumb indexed?\n\nReply\n\n  8.
