The median price for homes\nsold in Cupertino is $2 million, according to a recent report by Rocket Homes.\nAnd the tiny house on Carmen Road shows that size doesn\u2019t always matter.\n\nCalifornia\n\nFor Subscribers\n\n### California housing crisis so bad once-modest towns have become \u2018million-\ndollar cities\u2019\n\nAfter adding 12 this year, California accounts for 210 of the country\u2019s 550\ncities where the typical home value is more than $1 million, according to an\nanalysis by Zillow.\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\nPerez, the co-listing agent for the home, said the team knew the bulk of the\nvalue of the property was in the land.\n\nThe property has potential for expansion or building on, but the \u201cshock\nfactor\u201d for everyone was the size of the home and its accompanying price tag,\nshe said.\n\nThe Zillow listing says the home is nestled at the end of a cul-de-sac, near\nhiking trails and Silicon Valley\u2019s tech hubs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore importantly, Perez said, the home is close to the Los Altos Hills border,\nan area where home values start at an estimated $5 million, according to\nZillow.\n\nLos Altos Hills home values influence those in adjacent communities, an added\nbonus for someone who wants to build. Perez said the city of Cupertino\u2019s\nplanning department will allow the property owner to build a home that\u2019s more\nthan 3,600 square feet in size.\n\n\u201cIt definitely is location, location, location, as cliche as that may sound,\u201d\nshe said.\n\nHousing & Homelessness\n\n### All-cash offers, wealthy buyers push Southern California home prices to a\nrecord\n\nSouthern California home prices have hit a record despite high interest rates,\na reflection of a shortage of inventory and the region\u2019s wealth disparity.\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\nThe broker could not disclose the total price tag until the sale is final but\nsaid it\u2019s selling for \u201cconsiderably over asking.\u201d\n\nNeighbors told Perez that the home was initially used as a hunting cabin.\n\n\u201cThe home was actually built brick by brick in the 1940s by the family that is\ncurrently selling it,\u201d she said.\n\nIt was later used by the family as a rental but became vacant for some time.\n\n### More to Read\n\n  * For Subscribers\n\n### These are the California cities where $150,000 still buys you a home.\nCould you live here?\n\nApril 25, 2024\n\n  * ### Record deals and tax-avoidance maneuvers: Southern California\u2019s priciest sales of 2023\n\nDec. 28, 2023\n\n  * ### Can\u2019t afford California housing?
