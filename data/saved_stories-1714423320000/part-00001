Discovery, got a 27% increase in\n> total compensation for 2023.\n>\n> According to the company\u2019s proxy statement, Zaslav was paid $49.7 million,\n> including $3 million in salary, $23.1 million in stock awards and $22\n> million in non-equity incentive plans compensation. He received $39.3\n> million in 2022.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s still lower that previous years\u2019 compensation. Zaslav made a whopping\n$246 million in 2021 thanks to a hefty $203 million in stock options tacked on\nto his pay. It\u2019s highly representative of the modern U.S. media sector, where\nthe least competent brunchlords fail upward into positions of power, struggle\nrepeatedly at any sort of competency, then get rewarded for it.\n\nYou\u2019ll recall this entire mess started with AT&T\u2019s disastrous $200 billion\nacquisitions of DirecTV and Time Warner, which resulted in upwards of 50,000\nlayoffs despite the company nabbing a $42 billion tax cut from the Trump\nadministration. After incompetent AT&T executives failed at their bundled\npivot to video advertising, they spun Time Warner off into its own entity.\n\nShortly thereafter Discovery acquired the remaining assets creating yet\nanother company, and things just kept getting worse. The resulting giant\u2019s\noften been too cheap to pay residuals, resulting in a lot of popular content\ngetting pulled from its streaming services. More recently executives took heat\nfor backing away from the HBO brand, about the only consistently popular part\nof the company\u2019s assets.\n\nMost of these decisions may gain short-term tax breaks, stock boosts, or \u201cI\u2019m\na savvy dealmaker\u201d participation trophies on executive resumes, but they\u2019ve\ngenerally been terrible for debt loads, customer satisfaction, employee\nhappiness, and the longer-term health of the brands.\n\nKind of amusingly, trade magazines like Broadcasting and Cable don\u2019t think\nit\u2019s worth noting any of the chaos, product quality issues, or layoffs in\ntheir announcement of the news. Neither does The Hollywood Reporter. And\nDeadline found time to mention that Zaslav is the \u201cposter child of high\nexecutive compensation,\u201d but didn\u2019t think any of the Zaslav\u2019s failings were\nrelevant to their story.\n\nIt\u2019s nice work if you can get it.\n\nFiled Under: brunchlords, david zalsav, excessive executive compensation,\njournalism, layoffs, media, mergers Companies: warner bros. discovery\n\n5 CommentsLeave a Comment\n\nIf you liked this post, you may also be interested in...\n\n  * UK Prosecutors Apologize For Pursuing BS Charges Against A Photographer\n  * Fake 'Pink Slime' Propaganda Newspapers Surge Ahead Of Fall Election\n  * An Only Slightly Modest Proposal: If AI Companies Want More Content, They Should Fund Reporters, And Lots Of Them\n  * Company At Center Of Sports Illustrated, Gannett 'AI' Content Scandals Continues To Fail Upward\n  * Meta\u2019s Dumb Deletion Of Links To Journalism Shows Why Attempts To Tax Platforms That Link To Journalism Is Even Dumber\n\nClick to toggle\n\nRate this comment as insightful\n\nRate this comment as funny\n\nYou have rated this comment as insightful\n\nYou have rated this comment as funny\n\nFlag this comment as abusive/trolling/spam\n\nYou have flagged this comment\n\nThe first word has already been claimed\n\nThe last word has already been claimed\n\n## Comments on \u201cDiscovery CEO Zaslav Gets A Big Fat Raise Despite Being\nTerrible At His Job\u201d\n\nSubscribe: RSS Leave a comment\n\n5 Comments\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nThis comment has been deemed insightful by the community.\n\nAnonymous Coward says:\n\nApril 29, 2024 at 5:40 am\n\nIt\u2019s times like this that I recall a few choice quotes from Nick Hanauer\u2019s\narticle, The Pitchforks Are Coming... For Us Plutocrats:\n\n> The standard response in the minimum-wage debate, made by Republicans and\n> their business backers and plenty of Democrats as well, is that raising the\n> minimum wage costs jobs. Businesses will have to lay off workers. This\n> argument reflects the orthodox economics that most people had in college. If\n> you took Econ 101, then you literally were taught that if wages go up,\n> employment must go down. The law of supply and demand and all that. That\u2019s\n> why you\u2019ve got John Boehner and other Republicans in Congress insisting that\n> if you price employment higher, you get less of it. Really? Because here\u2019s\n> an odd thing. During the past three decades, compensation for CEOs grew 127\n> times faster than it did for workers. Since 1950, the CEO-to-worker pay\n> ratio has increased 1,000 percent, and that is not a typo. CEOs used to earn\n> 30 times the median wage; now they rake in 500 times. Yet no company I know\n> of has eliminated its senior managers, or outsourced them to China or\n> automated their jobs. Instead, we now have more CEOs and senior executives\n> than ever before. So, too, for financial services workers and technology\n> workers. These folks earn multiples of the median wage, yet we somehow have\n> more and more of them.\n>\n> We rich people have been falsely persuaded by our schooling and the\n> affirmation of society, and have convinced ourselves, that we are the main\n> job creators. It\u2019s simply not true. There can never be enough super-rich\n> Americans to power a great economy. I earn about 1,000 times the median\n> American annually, but I don\u2019t buy thousands of times more stuff. My family\n> purchased three cars over the past few years, not 3,000.

What nonsense this is. Am I really such\na superior person? Do I belong at the center of the moral as well as economic\nuniverse?\u201d\n\nThey really do believe this, even the ones who don\u2019t. Because the alternative\nwould be to accept reality, that not everyone can live the dream. For there to\nbe a rich class, there has to be a poorer worker class doing all the crappy\nmaintenance and logistics jobs that the wealthy wouldn\u2019t be seen doing. The\ntruth is that there isn\u2019t a space for everybody to be at the rich person\u2019s\ntable.\n\nSo the narrative has to be turned into an issue of morality. There has to be a\nnarrative of pulling yourself up by your bootstraps, that there exists for\neveryone a threshold of work and effort that you can put in, after which the\nworld will surely be yours if you just keep working, working, working. Never\nmind that vacancies are limited and competition is fierce, this is the only\nsystem that works! Because to believe otherwise would be to realize that you,\nin fact, don\u2019t control most of the outcome. It would be to realize that\nsuccess heavily depends on luck. But you can\u2019t tell people that, because then\npeople stop trying. Investing becomes speculating. So you have to keep selling\nthis idea that failure is immoral. CEOs get their golden umbrellas because\nthey deserve it, and you\u2019ll have to work a lifetime before you even come close\nto being in their shadow.\n\nThe trouble with that is that kids nowadays have actually done the one thing\nthat the CEOs are terrified of: they\u2019ve given up.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nThat One Guy (profile) says:\n\nApril 29, 2024 at 5:54 am\n\n# When tomorrow is always someone else's problem...\n\nIn a system that places value solely on how much money you\u2019re making today\ndoing whatever it takes to ensure that you\u2019ll always be making more today than\nyou made yesterday, with tomorrow brushed aside as not worth considering sadly\nit makes perfect sense to reward those at the top for burning a companies\u2019\nfuture to the ground so long as it makes things better for the execs in the\nshort term.\n\nAfter all, once one company crashes and has been looted until there\u2019s nothing\nleft for those running it there\u2019s always more to jump to for an \u2018executive\nexperienced in the field of business and/or management\u2019...\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nNimrod (profile) says:\n\nApril 29, 2024 at 7:29 am\n\nThere\u2019s no valid excuse for that level of compensation. There is literally\nNOTHING anyone could possibly achieve that would justify it. If this clown had\nany level of empathy, we\u2019d be reading about his MASSIVE charitable donations.\nI suspect there are NONE. At least pro athletes work hard to maintain their\nelite physicality. CEOs are PARASITES. Their only actual work is in deceiving\nthose foolish enough to employ them.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\n## Add Your Comment Cancel reply\n\nFunniest/Most Insightful Comments Of The Week At Techdirt\n\nDiscovery CEO Zaslav Gets A Big Fat Raise Despite Being Terrible At His Job\n\nFollow Techdirt\n\n### Techdirt Daily Newsletter\n\nA weekly news podcast from Mike Masnick & Ben Whitelaw\n\nSubscribe now to Ctrl-Alt-Speech \u00bb\n\nEssential Reading\n\n#### The Techdirt Greenhouse\n\nRead the latest posts:\n\n  * Winding Down Our Latest Greenhouse Panel: The Lessons Learned From SOPA/PIPA\n  * From The Revolt Against SOPA To The EU's Upload Filters\n  * Did We Miss Our Best Chance At Regulating The Internet?\n\nRead All \u00bb\n\n#### Trending Posts\n\n  * Microsoft Forgets To Renew Domain...
