They're also gradually refining driver assistance\ntechnology and figuring out how to make vehicles an extension of their\ndrivers.\n\nSony Honda Mobility's (SHM) main aim with its AFEELA luxury-tier sedan concept\nis to put the emphasis on the latter. The dynamic duo's website is filled with\nmarketing buzzwords, but what is the concept actually like in person?\n\nRecently, I was invited by SHM to check out AFEELA firsthand. It's still very\nmuch a prototype, so certain key information like price, range, and charging\ntimes weren't disclosed. But it was still worthwhile to see how these two\nJapanese institutions put their know-how into this spacious sedan.\n\nEnlarge / If you see a resemblance to another EV in the AFEELA, it might just\nbe the aerodynamics.\n\nPeter Nelson\n\n## Long-live big sedans\n\nRegardless of manufacturer, I'm a sucker for big sedans, and it's cool to see\nAFEELA continuing down this road, torch in hand. The car is a handsome, sleek\nbrute. One might call it a Lucid knock-off, but I'd say it's more a case of\nmodern design language meeting optimized aerodynamics in spacious sedan\npackaging.\n\nWhen AFEELA personnel pressed a somewhat hidden button near the car's window\nframe, the large front driver door swung wide open, revealing a very welcoming\nenvironment. Integrated into the B pillar is a facial recognition camera that\nallows for even more seamless opening and closing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe interior is minimalistic and airy, with a single knob in the center\nconsole\u2014presumably for park, forward, and reverse\u2014and instead of a usual\nsteering wheel, there's a yoke for what AFEELA personnel described as an\nuninhibited view of the instrument cluster screen. Stage right of that is a\nmassive screen displaying an expansive infotainment system, with a Sony gaming\ncontroller mounted below in its own dedicated holder\u2014more on that in a bit.\n\nEnlarge / Hopefully, the production version will come with a steering wheel\ninstead of this yoke.\n\nPeter Nelson\n\nBoth the front and rear seat areas are roomy, with pleasant overall materials\nquality and supple white leather. Visibility is generally good; the car's\nhigher beltline means you sit down in it like a cocoon of luxury. Rear-seat\npassengers each get a panoramic screen, though I didn't spend much time back\nthere, and the units present were non-functioning.\n\n## An expansive user interface\n\nAFEELA's three core pillars are augmentation, autonomy, and affinity.\nAugmentation means that the vehicle can change and adapt to the owner, and it\nhas a variety of available themes to suit any personality. Sony's Gran Turismo\nproperty is available as a theme, changing AFEELA's interface colorways and\nvarious sounds to give them more enthusiasm. [You can also drive the AFEELA\nnow in GT7 thanks to the latest update. Stock, it understeers too much.\u2014Ed.]\n\nEnlarge / No, there's still no word on pricing.\n\nPeter Nelson\n\nThat's fun and all, but what really struck me was how seamless the interface\nwas. To move different screens around\u2014within the massive center screen or to\nothers throughout the vehicle\u2014just press, hold, move, and release. Haptic\nfeedback is quite good, the graphics are incredibly crisp and colorful, and\nthere is no lag in moving elements between screens. As personnel pointed out,\nSony has extensive experience here due to its smartphone and gaming system\ndevelopment, and it certainly shows.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Scientists Respond to Science Deniers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n45\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Channel Ars Technica\n\n#### How Forza's Racing AI Uses Neural Networks To Evolve\n\nToday on War Stories, Ars Technica is joined by Dan Greenawalt, Creative\nDirector of the Forza franchise, who takes us through the colossal potential\n(and many challenges) of utilizing deep neural networks to build sophisticated\nracing AI. Beginning with the original Drivatar AI in Forza Motorsport for\nXBOX in 2005, Greenawalt and his colleagues experimented with computer\nlearning, refining their methods from iteration to iteration. It was once the\nAI system was unshackled from local hard drives and placed online in Forza\nMotorsport 5, however, that the floodgates truly opened. As the AI rapidly\nevolved, producing unexpected new behaviors, the Forza team quickly learned\nhow challenging it would be to wield this two-edged sword in creating\nrealistic opponents.\n\n  * ##### How Forza's Racing AI Uses Neural Networks To Evolve\n\n  * ##### The supercharged Ferrari 488 GTB | Ars Technica\n\n  * ##### Aston Martin's DB11 V12\n\n  * ##### Fast, fun, and freaky: A review of the Alfa Romeo Stelvio\n\n  * ##### The best features of the best cars at the L.A.
