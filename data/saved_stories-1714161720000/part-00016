That represented a 16 percent\nincrease on the previous year.\n\nDaina Petronis is a full-time curriculum designer and former high school\nEnglish teacher who runs the online teaching resources community\nmondaysmadeeasy.com. She believes that while there may come a day when the\nlikes of ChapGPT have a place in the classroom, right now the biggest\nchallenge facing teachers when it comes to language learning models (LLMs) is\ntheir potential misuse.\n\n\"In theory, LLMs can benefit learning, but there needs to be plenty of support\nin place to ensure that they are not being misused,\" Petronis told Newsweek.\n\nNewsletter\n\nThe Bulletin\n\nYour Morning Starts Here\n\nBegin your day with a curated outlook of top news around the world and why it\nmatters.\n\nBy clicking on SIGN ME UP, you agree to Newsweek's Terms of Use & Privacy\nPolicy.

Daina Petronis has found a way to\ncatch out those using ChatGPT on their essays. All it takes is one small edit.\nTikTok/mondaysmadeeasy\n\nMuch of Petronis's work involves researching trends in education, not least\nwhen it comes to the use of ChatGPT, the methods available to help teachers\ncatch those using LLMs illicitly, and the limitations around them.\n\nExclusively Available to Subscribers Try it now for $1\n\n\"I am often approached by companies developing AI-detection tools who are\nlooking to promote their software to my audience,\" she said. \"Before sharing\nthese tools with my community, I always ask their representatives about their\naccuracy. The consistent response from these companies is that there is no\nsurefire method to detect AI.\"\n\nAnother method endorsed by some involves asking the LLM if it produced the\nwork in question. \"I've actually tested this with several samples of original\nwriting alongside text generated by an LLM,\" Petronis said. \"I used my own\nwriting that was published years ago and it falsely claimed to have generated\nit. I also used the writing that it had generated, and it didn't recognize\nit.\"\n\nThankfully, Petronis has hit upon a much simpler approach at weeding out the\ncheats using what she calls a \"trojan horse\" hack. In a video posted to her\nTikTok account mondaysmadeeasy, she explained \"this hack is pretty clever and\ncan show you exactly what to look out for without the use of any software of\nspecial programs.\"\n\nMap shows states where teachers can carry guns\n\nRead more\n\nMap shows states where teachers can carry guns\n\nShe begins by splitting her essay prompt\u2014the title of the essay given to her\nstudents\u2014into two paragraphs before adding a sentence in-between in white\nusing the smallest size possible. The idea is that if the essay prompt is\ncopied and pasted into ChatGPT, the teacher can then search for the sentence\nhidden in the small white font when the assignment is submitted.\n\nThough the video has been watched over one million times, garnering plenty of\npraise in the process, Petronis acknowledges there are \"limitations\" to the\nmethod.\n\n\"If a student happens to notice that there is hidden text in their assignment\nprompt, then there are some possible outcomes: they can either remove the text\nor mistake it as a part of the instructions,\" she said.\n\nHowever, she feels the positives far outweigh the negatives. \"What makes the\ntrojan horse arguably more effective than other methods is that it offers a\npoint of reference that is easy to identify and discuss with a student,\" she\nsaid. \"I would not feel comfortable talking to a student about their writing\nprocess just because an AI detection tool or an LLM indicates that it's been\nplagiarized. But if I saw that their work had my trojan horse terms in it, I\ncould simply ask them about it in an open-ended way.\"\n\nThough the clip has been praised for highlighting a simple way to tackle\nplagiarism, Petronis said some watching the clip \"misunderstood\" the message\nof the video as being \"anti-AI.\" Petronis refutes this suggestion.\n\n\"Even though this video sparked a lot of controversy, I think many of us have\nthe same goal\u2014we want what is best for students,\" she said. \"While some people\nbelieve this involves training children on AI so that they can use it in the\nworkforce, educators also understand literacy to be a more valuable skill and\na prerequisite for using AI appropriately.\"\n\n## Uncommon Knowledge\n\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding\nconnections in the search for common ground.\n\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding\nconnections in the search for common ground.\n\nRequest Reprint & Licensing Submit Correction View Editorial Guidelines\n\n### About the writer\n\nJack Beresford\n\nJack Beresford is a Newsweek Senior Internet Culture & Trends Reporter, based\nin London, UK.
