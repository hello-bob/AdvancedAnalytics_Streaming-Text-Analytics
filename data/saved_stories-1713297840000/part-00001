The intention was to design and make a\nmuch large more complex roller coaster some time in the future, using what\nI've learnt from building the prototype to develop a good design and\nconstruction technique. I've used several different designs of track and most\nof them are present on this prototype in one place or another, albeit a small\nsection which I didn't get around to replacing. In order for the truck to make\nit all the way around the circuit, I have had to weight it down with blu-tack\nand coins. This has resulted in a non-functioning lift mechanism, which will\nneed to be fixed before I can really call this coaster a success.\n\n## The Failed Prototype\n\nThe idea was to make a framework using lolly sticks and somehow fix model\nrailway 'flexitrack' to the frame. I was using OO/HO gauge flexitrack which,\nalthough fantastic for bending into complex corners and bends for home made\nrailways, wasn't design to bend up and down and it completely warped the lolly\nstick frame out of shape. Also, the amount of glue needed to hold it in place\ncompletely clogged up the rails.\n\n## The Future Coaster\n\nworks but it results in a weak and flexible frame, making it easy to break and\nhard to be accurate. My current idea is to use strips of thin plywood to\nreplace the framework, but possibly keep lolly sticks for the track. We shall\nsee. Hopefully I'll have some time free sometime to knock up a few plans, and\nif I ever do get around to building this 'proper' coaster I might even write\nup a proper page to go with it.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
