But they may be leaving out an important variable:\nAnimals, from earthworms to elephants, can have a significant, though\nheretofore little-studied, influence on how carbon is captured and stored in\necosystems.\n\nA new theoretical framework, published in the Journal of Geophysical Research:\nBiogeosciences by Matteo Rizzuto and colleagues, offers a road map for\nincluding animals in carbon cycle models. Their work shows that adding both\nherbivores and predators to such models significantly alters both the amount\nand the dynamics of carbon cycling.\n\nFuture modeling of carbon dynamics, important for understanding climate change\nand designing nature-based carbon sequestration projects, should take animals\ninto consideration as well, researchers argue.\n\nAnimals affect carbon cycling directly by eating plants or by eating other\nanimals that eat plants. By producing waste, respiring, and even trampling\nleaves on the forest floor, they also indirectly speed up the rate at which\nnutrients\u2014including carbon\u2014are recycled. Overall, the authors found, on\naverage, a twofold increase in ecosystem carbon sequestration when animals\nwere included in their carbon cycle model.\n\nBy pairing an ecosystem compartment model (which considers plant, animal, and\nsoil microbial trophic compartments) with a traditional carbon modeling\napproach, the authors found noteworthy increases in both primary productivity\n(i.e., plant growth) and carbon sequestration, as well as changes to carbon\ncycle dynamics, when animals are included in carbon models.\n\nImportantly, these effects can be complex and are mediated by feedback loops\nthat are still not completely understood. For example, a scenario that\nincludes herbivores but not predators showed the highest levels of carbon\nsequestration. Adding in predators decreased overall carbon sequestration,\nthough it remained higher than a scenario with no animals.\n\nAdding animals to carbon cycle models leads to a significant \"rewiring\" of the\ncarbon cycle that will require further study to better understand, the authors\nconclude. Distinguishing between herbivore and predator types, as well as\nadding ecosystem-specific animal behavior dynamics to models, could help\nrefine models in the future.\n\nThis kind of work could inform future nature-based carbon sequestration\nproposals and highlights the importance of animals of all kinds for combating\nclimate change.\n\nMore information: Matteo Rizzuto et al, Rewiring the Carbon Cycle: A\nTheoretical Framework for Animal\u2010Driven Ecosystem Carbon Sequestration,\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences (2024).
