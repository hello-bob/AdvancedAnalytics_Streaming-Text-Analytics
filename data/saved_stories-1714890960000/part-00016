It\u2019s time to rethink\nclimate adaptation, with retreat as the first step.\n\nSian Roper for Noema Magazine\n\nEssayClimate Crisis\n\nBy Brian Stone Jr April 25, 2024\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nCredits\n\nBrian Stone Jr. is a professor in the School of City and Regional Planning and\ndirector of the Urban Climate Lab at the Georgia Institute of Technology. This\nessay is adapted from his recent book, \u201cRadical Adaptation: Transforming\nCities for a Climate Changed World\u201d (Cambridge University Press, 2024).\n\nIn the months after Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans proposed a flood control\nprogram unlike any other in U.S. history. Developed by the Bring New Orleans\nBack Commission, a diverse group of stakeholders appointed by the mayor, the\nresulting plan called for large parts of the city to be converted from\nlongstanding residential zones to floodable parks. Released to the public in\nthe form of a map, large green circles were positioned over neighborhoods\nwhere owners would be forced into buyouts. These were some of the most\nhistoric districts in a very historic city \u2014 the Lower Ninth Ward, St. Claude,\nGentilly \u2014 and almost exclusively in majority Black and marginalized\nneighborhoods.\n\nChristened in the press as the \u201cGreen Dot\u201d map, the proposal ranks among the\nmost profoundly unsuccessful plans ever issued by a municipal body and would\nnever be put to a vote in the city council. But it would give life to an idea\nthat has only grown more compelling in the subsequent decades: We cannot\nengineer our way out of climate change; retreat is inevitable \u2014 and not just\nin coastal cities.\n\nThe Green Dot map\u2019s remarkably brief tenure can be attributed in part to its\nproponents\u2019 failure to adhere to the most basic rule of community planning:\nNever designate the where before building support for the what. It is possible\nthat a proposal pairing the creation of floodable space somewhere in New\nOrleans, alongside the offer of generous and non-compulsory property buyouts,\ncould have engendered community support \u2014 indeed, more than a decade after the\ncity\u2019s almost complete inundation, space for a large floodable park was\nassembled from publicly acquired land in Gentilly.\n\nBut because the commission launched into climate adaptation with a list of\nneighborhoods to be condemned, an opposing army immediately assembled. Today,\nthe Green Dot map endures only as a precisely-how-not-to-do-it example in\nurban planning textbooks and, until recently, as a small but popular French\nbrasserie situated in one of the neighborhoods targeted for abandonment: the\nGreen Dot Cafe (4.6 stars).\n\n\u201cRetreat is inevitable \u2014 and not just in coastal cities.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\nAlmost 20 years after the devastation of Katrina, neither New Orleans nor the\nUnited States national government has developed a policy framework for planned\nretreat. Much of New Orleans recovered and even thrived in that time, but some\nneighborhoods today are characterized more by land vacancy than occupation and\noften lack the most basic of community amenities: schools for neighborhood\nchildren, markets and restaurants within walking distance, churches and other\ncommunity institutions.\n\nMost importantly, enshrining a \u201cright to return\u201d everywhere in post-Katrina\nNew Orleans resulted in a greater resilience to flood risk almost nowhere. The\nmost serious risk confronting residents today is not a levee-topping storm\nsurge but a bowl-filling deluge. New Orleans now floods annually from heavy\nstorm events that overwhelm the drainage network of a city that sits at a\nlower elevation than the water that surrounds it. A more extensive network of\nfloodable parks is arguably the most effective strategy to prevent regular\nflooding of streets, homes and businesses, but there is no plan yet in place\nto bring this outcome about, even in low-lying areas that remain largely\ndepopulated.\n\nNew Orleans is not unique in the extreme risk of climate change it confronts.\nAll major cities are now at an elevated risk of three climate impacts for\nwhich they are largely unprepared: extreme flooding, extreme drought and\nextreme heat. This is not a future risk but one that is daily unfolding across\nthe U.S.\n\nIn the Southwest, rising temperatures are fueling elevated rates of\nevaporation and years of drought, forcing a growing number of communities to\nrely on the regular delivery of drinking water; in the Midwest, the intensity\nof heat and humidity may soon render basic municipal services, such as garbage\ncollection, too hazardous to operate during heat waves; along the east coast,\nhigh tides pull oceanside homes into the sea in calm weather. To watch a video\nof barrier island homes breaking up and falling into the Atlantic is \u2014 for me,\nat least \u2014 to experience initially a sense of awe at the destructive potential\nof a gradual but incessantly rising ocean. The emotion that lingers, however,\nis not one of wonder but of shame.\n\nOnly the most scientifically and institutionally incapable of societies would\nexperience such impacts from annual weather events that can be forecast years\nin advance. Perhaps more than the most violent of storms, it is the slowest-\nmoving climate impacts that are most clarifying: The era of retreat is\nunderway. It is an era for which we find ourselves remarkably unprepared.\n\nOur governmental programs for managing a rising risk of flooding assume three\nprincipal forms:\n\n  1. Engineered infrastructure to divert large quantities of rainfall and contain rising bodies of water;\n  2. Emergency response protocols for evacuation and post-event recovery when those systems are overwhelmed; and\n  3. Federally subsidized insurance and loan programs for assisting homeowners in rebuilding.\n\nNone of these is designed to relocate residents and property outside of high-\nhazard zones in advance of extreme weather events. Indeed, they make retreat\nless likely.\n\nHomeowners residing outside of federally designated high-risk flood zones\nassume urban drainage systems and levees will prevent flooding, despite the\nfact that an estimated 40% of all claims made under the National Flood\nInsurance Program involved homes situated outside of these zones. The\navailability of federal assistance to rebuild, even for property owners in\nfloodplains who elect to not carry flood insurance, enables residents to\nremain within increasingly hazardous zones for which no private insurance\ncompany would issue a policy.\n\nThe combined result is a steadily rising level of risk that is rooted as much\nin institutional negligence as in rapidly changing environmental conditions.\nWere it the stated aim of the U.S. government to maximize the human and\neconomic toll of climate change on its citizens, its policy framework may not\nlook much different from our current array of disaster response programs.\n\nAs I write, tens of thousands of property owners are rebuilding and repairing\nhomes, frequently with public dollars, across an expansive area of Florida\nthat was inundated by Hurricane Ian in 2022. A large percentage of these homes\nwere previously rebuilt following one or more of the 10 hurricanes that have\nblown through southwest Florida since their initial construction \u2014 again,\nfrequently with public dollars. It is a statistical certainty that many will\nagain require governmental assistance for rebuilding in the coming years.\n\nWere each of these homes required to carry a commercially available flood\ninsurance policy, it is likely not one would be rebuilt \u2014 the risk of future\nflood or wind damage during the standard period of a mortgage is rated at\n100%. But with few prohibitions on where homes can be constructed along the\nFlorida coast and the policy commitment of the federal government to provide\ndisaster recovery funds independent of projected climate risk, the debris\nfields of Florida\u2019s next hurricane are at this moment being populated.\n\nAs high-risk climate zones expand, other national governments are\nrestructuring programs for disaster recovery. Commencing in the 1990s, the\nNetherlands \u2014 a country perhaps more at risk to sea level rise than any non-\nisland nation \u2014 undertook a program at sharp odds with the U.S. approach to\nmanaging climate risk. Rather than raise and reinforce levee systems along\nrising water bodies, as has been the strategy in post-Katrina New Orleans, the\nDutch have pulled their levees back along several urban rivers, requiring\nhomes and businesses in the restored natural floodways to be relocated to\nhigher ground.\n\n\u201cThe debris fields of Florida\u2019s next hurricane are at this moment being\npopulated.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\nThe compensation offered is generous and, in some instances, complete\nneighborhoods have been relocated. But the property buyouts are mandatory;\nresidents must move. Known as the \u201cRoom for the River\u201d program, the Dutch\napproach is a process of planned retreat in advance of the next flooding\nevent; it enhances the long-term welfare of both the relocated property owners\nand the (far more numerous) people living adjacent to the expanded floodway.\nThe Dutch do not enshrine for their citizens a right of return. What they do\nenshrine is a right of resilience.\n\nRead Noema in print.\n\nFor anyone uncomfortable with the compulsory relocation of residents and\nbusiness owners from high-risk climate zones, consider what the Canadian\nprovince of Quebec did in the aftermath of destructive flooding events in 2017\nand 2019 along the Ottawa River. During these floods, a large number of\nproperties in Gatineau flooded twice; after the second inundation, the\nprovincial government predicated disaster relief funds on a requirement that\nhomeowners either use the money to relocate out of the expanding flood zone\nor, for those choosing to rebuild, consent to a permanent prohibition on any\nfuture public relief funds for both present and future property owners.\n\nThis \u201cone-and-done\u201d approach to disaster funds in the most hazardous areas\nalters the usual calculus of property owners considering a buyout option.\nThose choosing to remain in a high-risk climate zone must contemplate a\ndiminished future resale value should they elect to rebuild. In contrast to\npost-Ian Florida, a decision to rebuild in the expanded floodplain of the\nOttawa River is a decision perhaps to never sell a property that can neither\nbe insured nor receive public disaster funds for future rebuilding.\n\nWhatever the mechanism of retreat \u2014 mandatory (Dutch) or quasi-compulsory\n(Canadian) \u2014 success should be gauged in whether vulnerable residents are\nrelocated outside of zones certain to flood again and whether contiguous land\nis amassed to enhance the resilience of the larger urban population. To\njustify the substantial public investment needed to acquire property in zones\nall but certain to flood again, to burn again, to fall into the ocean, the\nacquired land must be actively managed to mitigate climate threats.\n\nA key distinction between these and the U.S. approach to disaster response is\nthat retreat is understood to be fundamentally a process of land assembly\nrather than one of land abandonment. The Dutch and the Canadians are not\nfleeing \u2014 they are staying. Retreat is the mode of remaining.\n\nRetreat as a process of land abandonment has its roots in the earliest policy\ndocuments on climate adaptation. In the first assessment report of the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1990, retreat was\nidentified as one of three options for climate adaptation and defined as the\n\u201cabandonment of land structures in vulnerable areas and resettlement of\ninhabitants.\u201d No mention is made in the report of repurposing abandoned land\nfor enhanced climate resilience, and this omission persists into contemporary\nU.S. programs focused on climate adaptation.\n\n\u201cWere it the stated aim of the U.S. government to maximize the human and\neconomic toll of climate change on its citizens, its policy framework may not\nlook much different from our current array of disaster response programs.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\nIn contrast to the IPCC formulation, which addresses retreat as the first of\nthree options, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency positions retreat as\nthe last of three possible actions, following the installation of flood\ndefenses without relocation (protection) and retrofitting development to allow\nfor periodic flooding (accommodation). If the most basic aims of climate\nadaptation are to protect vulnerable populations in advance of the next\ndestructive event and to minimize the number of households ultimately\ndisplaced, our retreat-last approach in New Orleans, the Florida coast and, to\nvarying degrees, all over the U.S., is failing on both fronts.\n\nThe mindset that positions retreat as abandonment is sustained by an idea that\nremains central to our national identity. Fueled by a vast expanse of\nappropriated land and a limitless cache of cheap energy, the American project\nof the last two centuries has largely centered on a process of continuous land\ndevelopment. Initially in the form of a westward migration and more recently\nin the form of sprawling urbanization, the most essential engine of American\ngrowth remains rooted in an ongoing process of spatial expansion.\n\nNow imperiled by too much water along its coasts and too little within its\ninterior, the American frontier is for the first time contracting. Neither our\nnational identity nor our governing institutions have yet reconciled with the\ninevitability of a spatial retrenchment. But it is in retrenchment that we may\nfind a new unifying project \u2014 particularly in our cities.\n\nThe great urban challenge of our time is not simply climate change \u2014 it is how\nto tackle the multi-generational problems of social justice, affordable\nhousing, meaningful employment and other dimensions of community well-being\nwithin the context of a rapidly changing climate. Rebuilding our cities,\nrendered imperative by a delayed response to climate change, will require a\nradically altered approach to managing flooding, to lessening heat exposure\nand to coping with drought \u2014 and it will require, for all of these purposes, a\nphysical restructuring of our urban landscapes.\n\nMoving forward, every building and land parcel will need to absorb a large\nfraction of the rainwater it receives, expand green cover for climate\nregulation and be integrated into a far more decentralized system of power\ngeneration and use. This adaptive rebuilding project cannot be separated from\nother longstanding urban challenges of equal import; it is a central mechanism\nthrough which expansive affordable housing, long-delayed environmental justice\nand a broader community revitalization can be realized. In this sense, the\npath forward is not to be found in climate adaptation but rather in an\nadaptive urbanism.\n\nRetreat is the essential catalyst of adaptive urbanism; it is a process\nthrough which threatened or underutilized urban land is repurposed for\nenhanced climate, social and economic resilience. Such a movement is beginning\nto take shape in large cities worldwide. In Denmark, shipping containers are\nconverted into affordable, amphibious housing. There and elsewhere, new\nfloating communities expanding into the underutilized slips of\ndeindustrializing dockyards offer a way to decouple life from land ownership \u2014\nand they are perfectly positioned to harness cheap solar energy.\n\n\u201cThe Dutch do not enshrine for their citizens a right of return. What they do\nenshrine is a right of resilience.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\nOther forms of amphibious housing constructed in expanding floodplains can\nrise and fall with periodic flooding, reimagining otherwise hazardous flood\nzones for low-cost housing. More than 10,000 floating homes are now in place\nin the Netherlands alone; the oldest have now successfully weathered more than\n20 years of climate-intensified storm events.\n\nIn New York, as much as 50 miles of parking lanes have been converted to\n\u201cparklets\u201d and \u201cstreeteries\u201d \u2014 gathering and dining spaces that have expanded\nfrom sidewalks into the street itself, reclaiming a small fraction of the vast\namount of Manhattan\u2019s land area that is set aside for vehicles. Better still\nwould be if the parking lanes were removed entirely and replaced with an\nintegrated network of bioswales (green areas along roadways for rainwater\ncollection), bike lanes and outdoor dining spaces.\n\nA larger-scale vision of adaptive urbanism includes repurposing surface\nparking lots and one-story buildings for multistory affordable housing\nintegrated with rooftop renewable energy and stormwater collection. A recent\nanalysis found that redeveloping underutilized land across New York could\nprovide affordable housing to more than a million residents. Virtually all of\nthese building sites are presently occupied by surface paving or low-rise\nbuildings, so a rebuilding process aimed at addressing the city\u2019s\naffordability crisis could be equally productive in lessening flood, heat and\ndrought risk if designed for these purposes.\n\nIn New York and other cities, the where of climate adaptation is again equal\nin importance to the what. Through its highly ambitious campaign to add a\nmillion trees to the city\u2019s canopy that began in 2007 \u2014 a campaign undertaken,\nin large part, to lessen heat exposure and flood risk \u2014 New York directed more\nthan 80% of the new trees to neighborhoods already well endowed with public\ngreenspace at the expense of lower-income and more racially diverse areas in\nwhich parks development has been underfunded. Moving forward, the opposite\nimperative should guide public investment in adaptive urbanism, with the most\nclimate-vulnerable zones prioritized in time and proportion of funding \u2014 a\nprinciple I refer to as \u201cleast-first.\u201d\n\nThe essential lesson from experiments in Copenhagen, Amsterdam, New York and a\ngrowing number of cities is that retreat is more than a process of\nretrenchment. One of an array of terms unhelpfully framing climate change as a\nmode of warfare, retreat can also be understood as a mode of transformation.\nDerived from the Latin infinitive retrahere, to retreat is to \u201cpull back\u201d; the\nold French word treat, derived from the same Latin root, translates as \u201cdeal\nwith.\u201d\n\nClimate change is not a battle to win or lose but a dynamic set of\nenvironmental conditions that we now must deal with. Planned retreat can be\nboth a process for relocating the most vulnerable out of harm\u2019s way and of\nleveraging publicly acquired land for a greater urban resilience \u2014 one\ndirected toward adaptive infrastructure and societal need. It is not overly\nambitious to suggest that we can make our cities more resilient by making them\nmore equitable, more beautiful and more tethered to their underlying ecology;\nthe earliest experiments make this obvious.\n\nRetreat, when framed as transformation, is not the end of the American\nfrontier but its much-needed reimagining. The initial step is to make room for\na broader resilience. To remain, we must first retreat.\n\nEnjoy the read?
