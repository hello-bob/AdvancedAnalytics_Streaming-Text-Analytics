Some of these\nmodels have names like Turing, and MAI.\u201d\n\nThe team working on MAI-1 is led by Mustafa Suleyman, who joined Microsoft in\nMarch after founding DeepMind \u2014 which was acquired by Google \u2014 and serving as\nCEO of Inflection AI, the Seeking Alpha report said.\n\nMicrosoft hired most of Inflection AI\u2019s staff and paid $650 million for rights\nto its intellectual property in March, per the report.\n\nThe tech giant could reveal a preview of MAI-1 at its May 21-23 Microsoft\nBuild developer conference, according to the report.\n\nIt was reported in March that Microsoft\u2019s hiring of Suleyman and most of the\nstaff of Inflection AI, and the naming of Suleyman to head the company\u2019s\nconsumer AI unit, marked the first time all of Microsoft\u2019s consumer AI\nbusiness was under a single leader.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that this next wave is one that for the consumer\nMicrosoft can really, really create incredible products,\u201d Suleyman told\nBloomberg at the time.\n\n#### Recommended\n\nReport: Microsoft Working on \u2018Far Larger\u2019 In-House AI Model\n\nECB Official: Central Banks Must \u2018Speed Up\u2019 CBDC Adoption\n\nOnly

intelligence (AI) solution designed\nto help issuers combat enumeration attacks.\n\nThe new VAAI Score tool is being added to the Visa Account Attack Intelligence\n(VAAI) offering, beginning with U.S. issuers, the company said in a Tuesday\n(May 7) press release emailed to PYMNTS.\n\n\u201cWith the VAAI Score, our clients now have access to real-time risk scoring\nthat can help detect the likelihood of an enumeration attack so issuers can\nmake more informed decisions on when to block a transaction,\u201d Paul Fabara,\nchief risk and client services officer at Visa, said in the release.\n\nEnumeration attacks, in which threat actors increasingly use automated\nscripts, botnets and other technologies to amplify these card testing attacks,\naccount for $1.1 billion in fraud losses, according to the release.\n\nThe VAAI Score will help reduce these losses by using generative AI to assign\neach transaction with a risk score and prevent these attacks in card not\npresent (CNP) transactions, the release said.\n\nThe tool can learn normal and abnormal transaction patterns, identify the\nlikelihood of complex enumeration attacks in real-time and help clients use\nthe risk score in their authorization decisioning when used with a rule\nengine, per the release.\n\n\u201cWith access to advanced technology, fraudsters are monetizing stolen\ncredentials faster than ever before,\u201d Michael Jabbara, senior vice president\nand global head of fraud services at Visa, said in the release. \u201cEnumerated\ntransactions impact the entire ecosystem, and with the VAAI Score, we\u2019re\ngiving our clients a sophisticated tool that can help prevent cardholder\naccounts from being compromised and stop fraudulent transactions before they\nhappen.\u201d\n\nPYMNTS Intelligence has found that many businesses and financial institutions\nare struggling to find ways to address the increasing sophistication of\nfinancial crime.\n\nFifty-eight percent of financial institutions said the sophistication of fraud\nschemes is a challenge in combating fraud, and about one-quarter of the\nlargest financial institutions by asset size consider this the most important\nchallenge they face, according to \u201cThe State of Fraud and Financial Crime in\nthe U.S.,\u201d a PYMNTS Intelligence and Featurespace collaboration.\n\nThe report also found that nearly two-thirds of financial institutions\nreported an increase in fraud using credit cards.\n\n#### Recommended\n\nVisa Adds Generative AI-Powered Tool to Combat Enumeration Attacks\n\nIs Apple at Risk of
