As an infra guy myself, I immediately thought about OpenTofu, now that\nwe're more than half a year after the fork from Terraform, they recently had a\nmassive release, and also had some interesting shenanigans with Hashicorp's\nlawyers accusing them of stealing their precious IP.\n\n## The Countless Pledges\n\nBack when they forked the code, the OpenTofu website showed some 18 FTEs\npledged by 4 companies to work full time on OpenTofu for at least 5 years, as\nyou can see below.\n\nOpenTofu pledges shown at https://opentofu.org/supporters/\n\nThe list also included some 800 individuals and over 160 companies in total,\nmost of them vaguely pledging Development; open-source community efforts,\nwhatever that means.\n\nWhen I first saw that last year I was sure they will crush Hashicorp when it\ncomes to development velocity.\n\nNow that 6 months have passed after the fork, I was curious how many of those\npledges materialized in actual involvement in the project, or were they just\ntrying to get backlinks to help their SEO.\n\n## The reality\n\nThanks to Github, we can clearly compare the OpenTofu community effort with\nthe pledges, and also with Hashicorp's development pace.\n\nLooking at the project's contributors graph on Github sadly only shows some 5\npeople actively contributing to OpenTofu at the moment, far from the 18 FTEs\npledged not so long ago.\n\nWe can see that at the beginning a few more people used to contribute, but\nunfortunately they soon either lost interest or were assigned to something\nelse by their employers.\n\nNow compare that with the same graph for Hashicorp's Terraform repo:\n\nI know that commits may not be the best way to compare projects like\nthis(please suggest a different metric) but to me it seems like Hashicorp\nstill invests more resources than the entire OpenTofu community combined.\n\nNow, there are also a few other projects under the OpenTofu Github\nOrganization. The vast majority are provider repos, largely maintained by the\ncloud providers, and kept largely in sync with their Hashicorp fork origins.\n\nThe main exception under active development is the Registry repo, for which\nyou can see the similar graph below:\n\nThe same pattern can be seen there as well, a bunch of people contributed at\nthe beginning, only to stop their involvement after a few months. Looking over\nthe last month and a half we can see these 4 people, most of them with just a\nhandful of commits:\n\nAnd now let's see a similar graph of the last few weeks for the main OpenTofu\nrepo:\n\nI'm not trying to judge anyone's productivity, but the way I see it, a FTE\ndeveloper should be able to churn out a bit more than a couple of commits in a\nmonth and a half, and anyone below that seems to me more like a drive-by\ncontributor than a pledged FTE.\n\n## Pulse graphs\n\nThen I got the idea to look at the Pulse graph over the last month, which\nshows this for the main OpenTofu repo, again seems like 6 people standing out\nfrom the pack of many drive-by contributors:\n\nand here the same Pulse view for Terraform, which has some pretty active\ndevelopers, at least when it comes to the number of commits, and about 9 in\ntotal standing out from the pack of drive-by contributors:\n\nAnd the same graph for the OpenTofu registry repo that shows a single\ncontributor but apparently for whatever reason the entire core team is\nconsolidated under a single name:\n\nOut of all these I'm honestly a bit disappointed, but not surprised.\n\nI've seen a very similar pattern for my own AutoSpotting Community Github\nrepo, which sadly hasn't seen any community contributions after I stopped\ncontributing code changes about 2 years ago and decided to keep proprietary\nthe many further enhancements I made since.\n\nMy only hope from this post is that it will keep these companies accountable\nto contributing how much they pledged at the beginning and inspire more of\nthose vague pledgers to take some action.\n\n\u2014\n\nDiscuss this on HackerNews.\n\nLeanerCloud News\n\nHome\n\nPosts\n\nAuthors\n\n\u00a9 2024 Cristian Magherusan-Stanciu.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTerms of Use\n\nPowered by beehiiv\n\n", "frontpage": false}
