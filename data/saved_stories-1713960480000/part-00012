The new train, which is considered the first \u201chigh-\nspeed\u201d rail in the United States, could cut down commute time for travelers\nand reduce greenhouse gas emissions that would otherwise be emitted from cars\nand planes. Brightline, the firm responsible for the project, received $3\nbillion in support from the federal government as part of the 2021 bipartisan\nInfrastructure law.\n\nDepartment of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who was one of several\nBiden Administration officials on site for a groundbreaking ceremony Monday,\ndescribed the moment as a \u201cmajor milestone in building the future of American\nrail.\u201d The ceremony symbolically took place on Earth Day.\n\n\u201cPartnering with state leaders and Brightline West, we\u2019re writing a new\nchapter in our country\u2019s transportation story that includes thousands of union\njobs, new connections to better economic opportunity, less congestion on the\nroads, and less pollution in the air,\u201d Buttigieg said in a statement.\n\nBrightline expects its trains will depart every 40 minutes from a station\noutside of the Vegas strip and another one in the LA suburb of Rancho\nCucamonga. When it\u2019s completed, the train will travel at 186 miles per hour,\nmaking it the fastest train in the US and comparable to Japan\u2019s famous bullet\ntrains. For context, Brightline\u2019s most recently completed train connecting\nparts of Florida is estimated to top out around 130 miles per hour. Both of\nthose still fall far short of the speed achieved by the world fastest commuter\ntrain in Shanghai, which can reportedly reach a speed of 286 miles per hour.\nStill, the new train could complete the 218 mile trip between Sin City and a\nsuburb of the City of Angels in just 2 hours and 10 minutes. That same trip\nwould take about four hours by car, and that\u2019s without substantial traffic.\n\nOnce built, the trains will reportedly include onboard Wi-Fi, restrooms, and\nfood and drinks available for purchase. Brightline hasn\u2019t provided an exact\nprice for how much an individual train ticket will cost but has instead said\nthey expect it to be roughly equivalent to the price of an airline flight.\nBrightline reportedly believes the train could attract 11 million one-way\npassengers annually once it\u2019s up and running.\n\n\u201cToday is long overdue, but the blueprint we\u2019ve created with Brightline will\nallow us to repeat this model in other city pairs around the country,\u201d\nBrightline founder Wes Edens said in a statement.\n\nThe US Department of Transportation estimates the new train could cut back\n400,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year and create 35,000 new jobs. It could\nalso help foster new, much-needed competition. Amtrak, the nation\u2019s primary\nlong distance rail provider, has long held a monopoly over long distance rail\nin the US, but many areas still remain unserved. Prior to this project, Las\nVegas, for example, did not have Amtrak service. Brightline is looking to\nbuild out more trains in the coming decade, with a focus on connecting areas\nthat commuters find too close to fly and too far to comfortably drive.\n\n## American high-speed rail is having a moment (finally)\n\nUS infrastructure policy has long favored automobiles over long-distance rail\nand mass transit, much to the consternation of climate activists who argue an\nover reliance on gas burning cars is contributing to worsening climate change.\nBut there are signs the country\u2019s attitude toward rails is beginning to\nchange. Brightline, the same company attempting to link Las Vegas and LA,\nrecently completed a first-of-its-kind train linking Miami, Aventura, Fort\nLauderdale, Boca Raton, and West Palm Beach in Florida. Brightline reportedly\nclaims its Florida train had 258,307 passengers in March.\n\nElsewhere, other new high-speed train routes are being considered in Texas,\nthe Pacific Northwest and other parts of California. Those efforts, if they\nmaterialize, will be made possible in part by billions of dollars worth of\ngrants set aside for rail as part of the infrastructure law. Still, receiving\nfunds and beginning projects are only the beginning of the battle. Rising\ncosts and routing disputes can delay and complicate and delay actual\ndevelopment. One proposed rail line running roughly 300 miles between San\nFrancisco and LA was first approved by voters in 2008 and has still yet to\nmaterialize. As of today, nearly two decades later, less than a quarter of\nthat rail line has been completed. Brightline is hoping it can avoid those\ncomplications with its new high-speed rail. If it does, commuters could expect\nto make the trip between Sin City and Hollywood by 2028.\n\nLike science, tech, and DIY projects?\n\nSign up to receive Popular Science's emails and get the highlights.\n\nLET'S GO\n\nLinks\n\nFollow us\n\nDISCLAIMER(S)\n\nArticles may contain affiliate links which enable us to share in the revenue\nof any purchases made.\n\nRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of\nService.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Recurrent.
