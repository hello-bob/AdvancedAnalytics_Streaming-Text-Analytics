If so, I'll publish zip-next\nunder the name zip within 24 hours, then make zip-next a wrapper and PR the\nRustSec advisory about zip-next within 24 hours of that. I believe the command\nto add me will be cargo owner --add Pr0methean, based on the following:\n\n    \n    \n    hennickc@f8ffc25e7f6e zip-next % cargo owner --list zip Updating crates.io index mvdnes (Mathijs van de Nes) Plecra hennickc@f8ffc25e7f6e zip-next % cargo owner --list zip-next Updating crates.io index Pr0methean (Chris Hennick)  \n  \n---  \n  \nMember\n\n###\n\nPlecra commented Apr 20, 2024\n\nThat should be done now :)  \n---  \n  \nMember Author\n\n###\n\nPr0methean commented Apr 20, 2024\n\nPublished as zip, made zip_next a wrapper, and opened rustsec/advisory-db#1949\nto advise of the name change.  \n---  \n  \nPr0methean closed this as completed Apr 20, 2024\n\nMember Author\n\n###\n\nPr0methean commented Apr 20, 2024 \u2022\n\n@Plecra May I please be an admin on this repo, so I can close issues and PRs\nthat are addressed in mine, and archive it once none remain?  \n---  \n  \ncakebaker mentioned this issue Apr 21, 2024\n\nchore(deps): update rust crate zip to v1 uutils/coreutils#6255\n\nMerged\n\n1 task\n\nPr0methean reopened this Apr 22, 2024\n\n###\n\ndjc commented Apr 23, 2024\n\nI definitely got confused by having two seemingly active repos -- would be\nnice to get this archived.

But I'll rename this repo to zip-old once @Plecra\nmakes me an admin.I also agree that this repo should be archived eventually,\nbut I'd like to at least triage the open issues and PRs first, copy over the\nones that are still valid, and close them (another reason I'll need to be a\nrepo admin). If the repo is archived with open issues and PRs, they'll become\nstuck open.  \n---  \n  \n###\n\nRouHim commented Apr 23, 2024\n\nSmells like xz, just kidding ;)  \n---  \n  \n###\n\nTheBlueMatt commented Apr 24, 2024\n\nNew maintainer pushing their way in on a strictly algorithm crate that doesn't\nreally need almost any maintenance to keep going, and then pushing code\ndirectly to master with no review, nice.  \n---  \n  \n###\n\ndjc commented Apr 24, 2024\n\n> Smells like xz, just kidding ;)\n\nYou joke, but IMO this is a scenario where it might make sense to ask\n@Pr0methean (with no ill intent) to declare/demonstrate somehow why they're\ntrustworthy to take over this pretty popular crate name, and/or to explore\nother options. This moved pretty quickly.  \n---  \n  \n###\n\ntnull commented Apr 24, 2024\n\n> Smells like xz, just kidding ;)\n\nTo be honest, this isn't super funny. If the xz case should have taught us one\nthing, it's that you shouldn't handle transfer of crate ownership like this,\nespecially if many crates in the ecosystem depend on it.  \n---  \n  \nMember Author\n\n###\n\nPr0methean commented Apr 24, 2024 \u2022\n\n@djc I think my work on the fuzz tests speaks for itself.And I have an\nincentive to keep going: I'm likely to be looking for a new job soon (should\nknow for sure by the end of May), so I need an open-source project in my\nportfolio that people have actually heard of and submitted issues and PRs\nagainst. From that perspective, zip was the right crate at the right time.  \n---  \n  \nContributor\n\n###\n\nNobodyXu commented Apr 24, 2024\n\nYeah, but maintainers are all busy and nobody volunteer to step up as new\nmaintainers until now \ud83d\ude02You would expect crates like this to get more\nattention, or even move into rust-lang.  \n---  \n  \nMember Author\n\n###\n\nPr0methean commented Apr 24, 2024\n\nAlso keep in mind that I'll be glad to work with another maintainer if and\nwhen one shows up.  \n---  \n  \nMember Author\n\n###\n\nPr0methean commented Apr 24, 2024 \u2022\n\n@Plecra Today I found out about GitHub's merge-queue feature\n(https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-\nyour-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-a-merge-queue). It\nseems like it would make it much easier to contribute a pull request when\nthere are already PRs open. It'd also let us limit the backlog of CI\nworkflows, which may be necessary to handle a surge in PRs given that I'm\nrunning fuzz in CI.)But a merge queue requires the repository to belong to an\norganization. What would you say to the idea of my becoming an org admin and\ntransfering my repo to zip-rs/zip2, while this one becomes zip-rs/zip1? (If\nwe're using a merge queue, we probably shouldn't allow ourselves to push to\nmaster without a PR, and instead just use Auto-Merge on our own PRs. We should\nbe able to enforce GPG signing if we use the \"squash and merge\" or \"merge\ncommit\" method.)  \n---  \n  \n###\n\njayvdb commented Apr 24, 2024\n\nAccording to https://github.com/zip-rs/zip/graphs/contributors , @Pr0methean\nhas had zero contributions to this original project. Is that right?One of the\nmajor reasons for the \"xz\" hack was the new owner was actually anonymous,\nusing the name Jia Tan (@JiaT75). I've done a bit of googling, and @Pr0methean\nhas a more normal digital footprint than @JiaT75 did. Still, two hours ago I\nsent an email to the unverified email address in this commit to check that the\nidentities line up. No response yet. Apologies Chris, but we need to check who\nis taking over projects/orgs that have a lot of dependencies, and very high\nnumber of downloads per day.  \n---  \n  \nMember Author\n\n###\n\nPr0methean commented Apr 24, 2024\n\nI responded from that email address once I saw your latest comment; I wasn't\nwatching it because it's a work email and I'm on leave.  \n---  \n  \n###\n\nRouHim commented Apr 24, 2024 \u2022\n\n> > Smells like xz, just kidding ;)\n>\n> You joke, but IMO this is a scenario where it might make sense to ask\n> @Pr0methean (with no ill intent) to declare/demonstrate somehow why they're\n> trustworthy to take over this pretty popular crate name, and/or to explore\n> other options. This moved pretty quickly.\n\nIn fact, it was a joking comment intended to make people aware of the\nsituation.I'm going to freeze my zip dependencies until this situation is\nclear.Also this passive aggressive first post that deliberately builds up\npressure on the maintainer. Exactly the same approach as xz. I don't want to\njump to conclusions, but it all seems a bit strange.  \n---  \n  \n###\n\njayvdb commented Apr 24, 2024\n\nResponse received.
