It's fast. And it's fun!\n\nWhat\u2019s Slowing You Down?\n\nWhat is your biggest inhibitor to shipping software faster?\n\nComplicated codebase and technical debt.\n\nQA, writing tests, and debugging.\n\nWaiting for PR review or stakeholder approval.\n\nI'm always waiting due to long build times.\n\nRework due to unclear or incomplete specifications.\n\nInadequate tooling or infrastructure.\n\nOther.\n\nWe'd love to hear what you think.\n\nCopilots, like all GenAI, are non-deterministic; meaning they vary in outcome.\nBut while using AI code assistants, developers can use prompt engineering to\nrefine and guide the AI for better outcomes, according to Rizel Scarlett \u2014 who\nis a developer advocate, including recently for GitHub Copilot.\n\nScarlett is now a staff developer advocate at TBD, a business unit operating\nwithin Block that\u2019s building open source platforms and protocols for\nexchanging money internationally. She shared five strategies for improving a\ncopilot\u2019s results at this week\u2019s InfoBip Shift conference in Miami.\n\nFirst, she set up a scenario: Imagine, she asked the audience, a developer\nnamed Dawson who suffers a bit from imposter syndrome. Fortunately for Dawson,\nshe has a friend who can help \u2014 a developer and time traveler named Phil, from\nDisney\u2019s Phil of The Future, except he\u2019s all grown up.\n\nDawson has a problem: She has to create an identity verification program, but\nshe doesn\u2019t know how and she\u2019s unsure how to really leverage Copilot to help\nher, Scarlett said. Phil is from the 22nd century when AI assistants are the\nnorm. He helps her jumpstart her efforts with five strategies for prompting\nCopilot.\n\n## Strategy 1: Provide High-Level Concepts\n\nThe first step is to provide the GPT with high-level context. In her scenario,\nPhil demonstrates by building a Markdown editor. Since Copilot has no idea of\nthe context, he has to provide it and he does this with a large prompt comment\nwith step-by-step instructions. For instance, he tells the copilot, \u201cMake sure\nwe have support for bold, italics and bullet points\u201d and \u201cCan you use\nreactions in the React markdown package.\u201d The prompt enables Copilot to create\na functional but unsettled markdown editor.\n\n## Strategy 2: Provide Details\n\nFollow up by providing the Copilot with specific details, Scarlett advised.\n\n\u201cIf he writes a column that says get data from [an] API, then GitHub Copilot\nmay or may not know what he\u2019s really trying to do, and it may not get the best\nresult. It doesn\u2019t know which API he wants to get the data from or what it\nshould return,\u201d Scarlett said. \u201cInstead, you can write a more specific comment\nthat says use the JSON placeholder API, pass in user IDs, and return the users\nas a JSON object. That way we can get more optimal results.\u201d\n\nTRENDING STORIES\n\n  1. The Future of SQL: Conversational Hands-on Problem Solving\n  2.

A Developer's Guide to Getting Started with LlamaIndex\n  4. 3 Reasons Tech Execs Are Slowing Down GenAI Projects\n  5. More than an OpenAI Wrapper: Perplexity Pivots to Open Source\n\n## Strategy 3: Provide Examples\n\nThere are three terms to understand when it comes to giving AI examples,\nScarlett said:\n\n  * Zero-shot learning, in which the model is expected to correctly make predictions for tasks on which they have never been explicitly trained. A human example would be trying to defeat a video game without playing it, but using strategies the gamer learned from previous video games.\n  * One-shot learning, which provides a single example to the AI. The corollary is being expected to competently play any character and defeat any opponent after playing one match in the game.\n  * Few-shot learning, where the model is provided with a small set of examples. This would be like doing two to five missions in the new game and then being expected to fully navigate the game.\n\n## Strategy 4: Keep A Few Tabs Open\n\nThis one may seem a bit surprising, but keeping open a tab or two open in the\neditor allows GitHub Copilot to gain context from the tabs. Too many open tabs\ncan lower the quality of the Copilot suggestions, she cautioned.\n\n## Strategy 5: Use Copilot Chat\n\nOur heroine Dawson loves the advice and results, but she actually would like\nto get code feedback. Copilots come with a chat function, which can be used\nfor tasks such as fixing bugs, formatting dates, refactoring code, testing\ncode and generating tests, Scarlett said. It can be asked to identify any bugs\nand then asked to provide a solution with a brief explanation, she said. She\nthen demoed asking GitHub Copilot to generate a test using the open source\nJavaScript testing framework, Jest. (Microsoft\u2019s Copilot also offers a chat\ninterface.)\n\nBy using Copilots, developers can do more than increase productivity, Scarlett\nadded. Copilots can also improve psychological safety, especially in new\ndevelopers or others who might have imposter syndrome, she said.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the reality is psychological safety is not always common at\nwork, especially in second history, and especially for minorities,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBeginner devs can gain reassurance from a Copilot because it can act as a\npeer, providing us with ideas when using a new tool for the first time.\u201d\n\nLoraine Lawson is a veteran technology reporter who has covered technology\nissues from data integration to security for 25 years.
