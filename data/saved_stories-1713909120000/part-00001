At\nthe same time, a lot of the executives and bad ideas that plagued the\ntraditional cable TV sector are coming along for the ride, resulting in a\nstreaming sector that looks more and more like the kludgy cable sector.\n\nThanks to industry consolidation and saturated market growth, the streaming\nindustry has started behaving much like the traditional cable giants they once\ndisrupted. As with most industries suffering from \u201censhittification,\u201d that\ngenerally means steadily worse service at higher prices as it tries to appease\nWall Street\u2019s demand for improved quarterly returns at any cost (even long\nterm company health).\n\nNetflix has started acting like password sharing, something it advocated for\nfor years, is a dire cardinal sin. Amazon decided it would be fun to increase\nthe number of ads it runs, charging Amazon Prime users even more money to\navoid them. Consumers are paying more for streaming than ever as layoffs\nabound, streaming catalogs shrink, and the underlying products steadily get\nworse.\n\nIn response, customers are starting to be a little smarter about their\nshopping habits, increasingly cancelling streaming services when they\u2019re not\nwatching them. According to the New York Times, more than 29 million U.S.\nconsumers \u2014 about a quarter of all domestic paying streaming subscribers \u2014\ncancelled three or more streaming services sometime in the last two years:\n\n> \u201cAmong these nomadic subscribers, some are taking advantage of how easy it\n> is, with a monthly contract and simple click of a button, to hopscotch from\n> one service to the next. Indeed, these users can be fickle \u2014 a third of them\n> resubscribe to the canceled service within six months, according to\n> Antenna\u2019s research.\u201d\n\nThe reduced revenues from people cancelling for months at a time will create\nnew pressure on streaming giants to deliver Wall Street those sweet quarterly\nreturns. Streaming profitability was already a challenge (NBCUniversal\u2019s\nPeacock lost $2.8 billion last year). In other words: improving service\nquality and expanding catalogs won\u2019t be at the top of the executive menu.\n\nSo now the race will be on to thrill Wall Street and goose revenues in other\nways. That means more price hikes, more pointless mergers (see: the whole AT&T\nTime Warner Discovery mess), and more bizarre restrictions. I\u2019d also suspect\nthey\u2019ll soon take another terrible cue from traditional cable: cutting corners\non customer service, and making it increasingly difficult to cancel service\nwithout headaches.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that streaming still hasn\u2019t been a dramatic improvement over\ntraditional cable television. But if the industry isn\u2019t careful, and there\u2019s\nno indication it wants to be, it\u2019s going to be repeating the same exact\ntrajectory and create openings for disruption of its own business models.\n\nFiled Under: cable, consumers, cord cutting, customer service, streaming, tv,\nvideo\n\n14 CommentsLeave a Comment\n\nIf you liked this post, you may also be interested in...\n\n  * Roku Eyes Patent That Would Inject Ads Into...

Netflix is 75% foreign\nsubscriptions now. The streaming business is obviously global and most\ncustomers are not Americans. That\u2019s true for Netflix and all the other\nstreamers that survive will get there too.\n\nSo what\u2019s up? Do Americans just love to churn but foreigners are a lot more\nloyal? How does the NY Times explain Netflix\u2019s continued growth to 270M\nsubscribers if everyone is churning up a storm? Obviously there are still big\nnumbers of new people flooding into streaming.\n\nI suspect that churners are a minority of the audience for Netflix and all the\nothers. Maybe foreigners churn less because streaming is more likely to be new\nto them, or because all the competitors (like Max) haven\u2019t expanded to the\nwhole world so there is less to churn to.\n\nAnd what\u2019s going to happen is, the streamers will look at the content the non-\nchurners watch and make more of that, too keep them loyal. As for churners,\nthey will roam at will and be ignored.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nAnonymous Coward says:\n\nApril 23, 2024 at 9:41 am\n\n# Re: Re: Re:\n\nTrue.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nswimming upstream says:\n\nApril 23, 2024 at 6:32 am\n\n# I'm happy\n\nI pay for one GREAT streaming service but I won\u2019t say what it is, lest it be\nruined.\n\nI might hint at some of the Criteria used to choose a streaming service,\nthough.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nSven Ceeez says:\n\nApril 23, 2024 at 6:57 am\n\n# Freedom from corporate greed, ineptitude, and malfeasance\n\nFreedom.

They go for a big service like Netflix or\nAmazon, maybe Disney. The others, not so much. A lot of people just want a big\nlibrary to choose from and don\u2019t care if they miss Show A or Movie B. Maybe\nthey\u2019ve never heard of them.\n\nThis means there\u2019s a high cutoff bar for success. Amazon, Netflix,\nDisney/Hulu, Max, Apple \u2013 all above. Paramount+ and Peacock, below. Peacock+\nmight be saved if Sony buys it and funnels its content to Paramount+ rather\nthan Netflix.\n\nAs for making it harder to cancel, not allowing monthly subscription, not\nallowing ad-free tiers: all red flags that signals it\u2019s time for me to switch\nto piracy, which I\u2019ve never done to date (honest!)\n\nBut I think the more likely option is that streamers focus on the type of\nsubscribers who never churn (and do other things they like, such as\nsubscribing to ad tiers and bundles) by making content for them and ignoring\nthe churners. They have enough data on everyone to tell the difference.\n\nNetflix has 270M subscribers now and they\u2019ve always made it easy to cancel. So\nclearly ease of cancellation is not the \u201cproblem.\u201d The problem, like it or\nnot, is that some of the platforms need to merge or die because there are too\nmany of them in a field that mainly rewards sheer bigness.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nAnonymous Coward says:\n\nApril 23, 2024 at 9:36 am\n\n# Re:\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nAnonymous Coward says:\n\nApril 23, 2024 at 9:48 am\n\n# Sorry for being pessimistic but:\n\nBut if the industry isn\u2019t careful, and there\u2019s no indication it wants to be,\nit\u2019s going to be repeating the same exact trajectory and create openings for\ndisruption of its own business models.\n\nYoutube has already been having problems. And I doubt tiktok would be the\ndisruptor for long, sold it not.\n\nAlso, do you realize the companies could also follow the disruption and do the\nsame thing they did to streaming and cable?\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\n## Add Your Comment Cancel reply\n\nMore Open Access Training For Academics Would Lead To More Open Access\n\nAny Privacy Law Is Going To Require Some Compromise: Is APRA The Right Set Of\nTradeoffs?\n\nFollow Techdirt\n\n### Techdirt Daily Newsletter\n\nA weekly news podcast from Mike Masnick & Ben Whitelaw\n\nSubscribe now to Ctrl-Alt-Speech \u00bb\n\nEssential Reading\n\n#### The Techdirt Greenhouse\n\nRead the latest posts:\n\n  * Winding Down Our Latest Greenhouse Panel: The Lessons Learned From SOPA/PIPA\n  * From The Revolt Against SOPA To The EU's Upload Filters\n  * Did We Miss Our Best Chance At Regulating The Internet?\n\nRead All \u00bb\n\n#### Trending Posts\n\n  * 'Lol, No' Is The Perfect Response To LAPD's Nonsense 'IP' Threat Letter Over 'Fuck The LAPD' Shirt\n  * The Future Of Streaming TV: More Pointless Mergers And Making It Harder To Cancel\n  * Jonathan Haidt\u2019s Book \u2018The Anxious Generation\u2019 Is Coddling The American Parent; Giving Them Clear, Simple & Wrong Explanations For What\u2019s Ailing Teens\n\nTechdirt Deals\n\nBuy Now\n\n$318.00\n\nThe Complete Certified Cisco Training Bundle\n\nTechdirt Insider Discord\n\nThe latest chatter on the Techdirt Insider Discord channel...\n\n  * mildconcern: And yes they were three solar flares going, one of which was big enough to be seen by the naked eye\n  * only two small sun spots though\n  * John Roddy: No, that's one *gigantic* sun spot.\n  * Mike Masnick: the weirdest thing, though, was we had no traffic at all. we found a small town in texas that was a bit off the beaten path, but looked like the weather would cooperate, and we drove 75 miles from our hotel to it, saw no traffic. was able to park easily, even grabbed a nice picnic table in a gazebo. soon after we got there, the park started to fill up, but it never got *crowded*. and then afterwards, we drove back and hit no traffic on the way back either. the only \"line\" we ran into was when stopped at a pie shop on our way back to get some pie to celebrate\n  * mildconcern: I think a lot of the real fanatics ditched going to Texas all together\n  * a fair few folks in the park I was at had plans to be there and then switched up at the last minute with the forecasts to come to New England instead\n  * The town I was in moved their location from the smaller park downtown to this bigger one just two days before the event because of the same factors\n  * Mike Masnick: like absolutely nothing has been crowded (other than the pie stand). pickup line for rental car was non existent. no traffic to the hotel. hotel did not seem crowded at all. everything has been smooth sailing.\n  * mildconcern: The second biggest cheer of the day (after totality) happened when a truck arrived with six more porta potties to help alleviate the hour long line\n  * But it was fun having a crowd. I brought my telescope which made me popular, and it was great letting other people look through it\n  * John Roddy: It was so overcast for me that I legit couldn't even see clouds.\n  * mildconcern: I wasn't really aiming to take pictures primarily but I did get a few\n  * John Roddy: Just a perfectly homogenous gray.\n  * mildconcern: https://www.instagram.com/p/C5jo...\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/C5jo_1bvI0S/?igsh=cW85dnc5czF4Zzg4\n\n  * Mike Masnick: Heh. Yeah, the park we were in had fixed bathrooms (and even cleaned them right after the eclipse so we had clean bathrooms to use before heading out) and a big row of porta potties, but neither ever got crowded. there was a *good* sized crowd but never got crowded\n  * The one thing we didn't really have where we were was a good view of the 360 degree sunset. I remember that from the last one we saw. but didn't really see it this time due to trees around the park.\n  * You should have driven over to where we were! No traffic, very few clouds.\n  * mildconcern: yeah I did not have as good a view of the 360 as I did in Casper Wyoming. It was pretty good and you got a sense of it because we were on a lakeshore but the other angles were mountains\n  * John Roddy: Unfortunately, I had a dentist appointment at just barely after the right time. :/\n  * Which is the only reason I'm able to eat anything again.\n  * Mike Masnick: we really lucked out in 2017, because we found this random hill in the middle of absolute nowhere, eastern oregon, that gave us a 360 degrees view of NOTHING but fields from the top. It was a perfect spot to watch\n  * John Roddy: They had to try like 20 different times to get the right set of x-rays.\n  * Mike Masnick: Yikes.\n  * John Roddy: So I'm expecting to grow a second tongue within the next few days or something.\n  * Interestingly, x-ray tech has finally been miniaturized enough that the camera is entirely handheld now.\n  * The tube just has a really thick glass shield lining the end of it, presumably lined with lead.\n  * deadspatula: Fascinatingly, the big advancement has been in better dosing, not simply the size of components. The big machines needed a big burst and leaked a lot of x-rays. That's why the dentist had to hide behind the lead wall and we covered the reproductive organs - the dose wasn't bad once every six months, but multiple times a day would be serious. And the units therefore needed to be mounted. The handheld units better direct a much lower dose, and manufacturers claim technicians do not get dangerous doses of stray x-rays. That said, the notable property of x-rays is penetration. Many of the units I've seen have a guard as you describe, but nothing opaque, and if its not opaque its not lined with enough lead to matter.\n  * John Roddy: Lead lined glass is almost certainly more than enough to at least scatter any stray x-rays that find their way back.\n  * But yeah, x-ray tech in general got a pretty significant overhaul in the past decade or so.\n  * When Chandra launched in '99, it was the heaviest payload the shuttle ever carried.\n  * Fast forward to '21, and we've got IXPE.\n  * Chandra is close to 6,000kg.\n  * IXPE is just over 300.\n  * mildconcern: I wonder how much the general advancement of detectors driven by the cell phone camera revolution has spilled over. That certainly has helped the field of astronomical detection quite a bit.\n  * Digital sensors that had laughable resolution used to cost a fortune in the 1990s when they started to come out. And now you can get miracle devices for far less.\n  * John Roddy: Cell phone stuff is all in the microwave range.\n  * That's most useful for detecting the cosmic microwave background, which is probably the closest thing to a natural encyclopedia we're ever going to get.\n  * mildconcern: phone cameras also do sense visual light\n  * John Roddy: I feel like everyone I tell this to is hearing it for the first time, but...\n  * I *thought* it was common knowledge that your phone camera is pretty good at seeing infrared too.\n  * It's a really quick and easy way to check if a remote control is working.\n  * Infrared LEDs *will* be visible through the sensor.\n  * mildconcern: Oh yeah I knew that, I was just being a wiseass\n  * it's not hugely far in the infrared spectrum\n  * can't use it as a heat detector or something. Just a smidge.\n  * but I'm mostly saying in terms of astronomy applications. The overall success in designing sensors and detectors in smaller scales has hugely helped anyway\n  * no matter the wavelengths\n  * John Roddy: Yeah, the interesting stuff requires some pretty intense tech.\n  * Almost everything glows in the infrared spectrum, after all.\n  * mildconcern: It's a big part of why they stuck the JWT in space\n  * since it's mostly working in that range\n  * John Roddy: That's only half the story\n  * Spritzer needed some pretty extreme shielding too.\n  * Except the tech wasn't *quite* ready to make the active cooling reliable enough.\n  * A lot of people think of \"cold\" in terms of what chilly weather feels like on earth.\n  * The cold air sucks the heat right out of you.\n  * But space doesn't have that air.\n  * So despite space being extremely cold, it's actually really hard to cool things down out there.\n  * The reason the space shuttle always had the bay doors open in orbit is because that's where the radiators were.\n  * mildconcern: yeah. but the IR wavelengfths that JWT are detecting can't even get through at all even in Earth orbit\n  * so that's why it's out at the Lagrange Point\n  * Despite the \"can't fuck this one up and fix it later\" nature of that as opposed to Hubble\n  * John Roddy: It's not even *at* the Lagrange point\n  * It's in an orbit around it\n  * Samuel Abram: I took a screencap of a thread on facebook, to illustrate the necessity of checkmarks as verification and not a marker of a paid status.\n  * Unfortunately, I can't upload it here\n  * [link]\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/17P1ICo5rwQcW4dnkY8KSX8XzdIXoSQZN/view?usp=drive_link\n\n  * John Roddy: Wow.
