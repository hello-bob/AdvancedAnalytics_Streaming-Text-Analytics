Given small wooden balls, the bees pushed them around and\nrotated them. The behavior had no obvious connection to mating or survival,\nnor was it rewarded by the scientists. It was, apparently, just for fun.\n\nThe study on playful bees is part of a body of research that a group of\nprominent scholars of animal minds cited today, buttressing a new declaration\nthat extends scientific support for consciousness to a wider suite of animals\nthan has been formally acknowledged before. For decades, there\u2019s been a broad\nagreement among scientists that animals similar to us \u2014 the great apes, for\nexample \u2014 have conscious experience, even if their consciousness differs from\nour own. In recent years, however, researchers have begun to acknowledge that\nconsciousness may also be widespread among animals that are very different\nfrom us, including invertebrates with completely different and far simpler\nnervous systems.\n\nThe new declaration, signed by biologists and philosophers, formally embraces\nthat view. It reads, in part: \u201cThe empirical evidence indicates at least a\nrealistic possibility of conscious experience in all vertebrates (including\nall reptiles, amphibians and fishes) and many invertebrates (including, at\nminimum, cephalopod mollusks, decapod crustaceans and insects).\u201d Inspired by\nrecent research findings that describe complex cognitive behaviors in these\nand other animals, the document represents a new consensus and suggests that\nresearchers may have overestimated the degree of neural complexity required\nfor consciousness.\n\nThe four-paragraph New York Declaration on Animal Consciousness was unveiled\ntoday, April 19, at a one-day conference called \u201cThe Emerging Science of\nAnimal Consciousness\u201d being held at New York University. Spearheaded by the\nphilosopher and cognitive scientist Kristin Andrews of York University in\nOntario, the philosopher and environmental scientist Jeff Sebo of New York\nUniversity, and the philosopher Jonathan Birch of the London School of\nEconomics and Political Science, the declaration has so far been signed by 39\nresearchers, including the psychologists Nicola Clayton and Irene Pepperberg,\nthe neuroscientists Anil Seth and Christof Koch, the zoologist Lars Chittka,\nand the philosophers David Chalmers and Peter Godfrey-Smith.\n\nWe have much more in common with other animals than we do with things like\nChatGPT.\n\nAnil Seth, University of Sussex\n\nThe declaration focuses on the most basic kind of consciousness, known as\nphenomenal consciousness. Roughly put, if a creature has phenomenal\nconsciousness, then it is \u201clike something\u201d to be that creature \u2014 an idea\nenunciated by the philosopher Thomas Nagel in his influential 1974 essay,\n\u201cWhat is it like to be a bat?\u201d Even if a creature is very different from us,\nNagel wrote, \u201cfundamentally an organism has conscious mental states if and\nonly if there is something that it is like to be that organism. ... We may\ncall this the subjective character of experience.\u201d If a creature is\nphenomenally conscious, it has the capacity to experience feelings such as\npain or pleasure or hunger, but not necessarily more complex mental states\nsuch as self-awareness.\n\n\u201cI hope the declaration [draws] greater attention to the issues of nonhuman\nconsciousness, and to the ethical challenges that accompany the possibility of\nconscious experiences far beyond the human,\u201d wrote Seth, a neuroscientist at\nthe University of Sussex, in an email. \u201cI hope it sparks discussion, informs\npolicy and practice in animal welfare, and galvanizes an understanding and\nappreciation that we have much more in common with other animals than we do\nwith things like ChatGPT.\u201d\n\n## A Growing Awareness\n\nThe declaration began to take shape last fall, following conversations between\nSebo, Andrews and Birch. \u201cThe three of us were talking about how much has\nhappened over the past 10 years, the past 15 years, in the science of animal\nconsciousness,\u201d Sebo recalled. We now know, for example, that octopuses feel\npain and cuttlefish remember details of specific past events. Studies in fish\nhave found that cleaner wrasse appear to pass a version of the \u201cmirror test,\u201d\nwhich indicates a degree of self-recognition, and that zebra fish show signs\nof curiosity. In the insect world, bees show apparent play behavior, while\nDrosophila fruit flies have distinct sleep patterns influenced by their social\nenvironment. Meanwhile, crayfish display anxiety-like states \u2014 and those\nstates can be altered by anti-anxiety drugs.\n\nShare this article\n\nCopied!\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\nAfter reflecting on recent research into diverse animal minds, Jeff Sebo,\nKristin Andrews and Jonathan Birch (from left) decided to organize scientists\nand philosophers to sign a declaration that extends consciousness to more\nanimals.\n\nFrom left: Kate Reeder; Ben Wulf; Maria Moore/LSE\n\n## Introduction\n\nThese and other signs of conscious states in animals that had long been\nconsidered less than conscious excited and challenged biologists, cognitive\nscientists and philosophers of mind. \u201cA lot of people have now accepted for a\nwhile that, for example, mammals and birds are either conscious or very likely\nto be conscious, but less attention has been paid to other vertebrate and\nespecially invertebrate taxa,\u201d Sebo said. In conversations and at meetings,\nexperts largely agreed that these animals must have consciousness. However,\nthis newly formed consensus wasn\u2019t being communicated to the wider public,\nincluding other scientists and policymakers. So the three researchers decided\nto draft a clear, concise statement and circulate it among their colleagues\nfor endorsement. The declaration is not meant to be comprehensive but rather\n\u201cto point to where we think the field is now and where the field is headed,\u201d\nSebo said.\n\nThe new declaration updates the most recent effort to establish scientific\nconsensus on animal consciousness. In 2012, researchers published the\nCambridge Declaration on Consciousness, which said that an array of nonhuman\nanimals, including but not limited to mammals and birds, have \u201cthe capacity to\nexhibit intentional behaviors\u201d and that \u201chumans are not unique in possessing\nthe neurological substrates that generate consciousness.\u201d\n\n[Octopuses have] got this attentive engagement with things, with us and with\nnovel objects that makes it very hard not to think that there\u2019s quite a lot\ngoing on inside them.\n\nPeter Godfrey-Smith, University of Sydney\n\nThe new declaration expands the scope of its predecessor and is also worded\nmore carefully, Seth wrote. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t try to do science by diktat, but\nrather emphasizes what we should take seriously regarding animal consciousness\nand the relevant ethics given the evidence and theories that we have.\u201d He\nwrote that he is \u201cnot in favor of avalanches of open letters and the like,\u201d\nbut that he ultimately \u201ccame to the conclusion that this declaration was very\nmuch worth supporting.\u201d\n\nGodfrey-Smith, a philosopher of science at the University of Sydney who has\nworked extensively with octopuses, believes that the complex behaviors those\ncreatures exhibit \u2014 including problem-solving, tool use and play behavior \u2014\ncan only be interpreted as indicators of consciousness. \u201cThey\u2019ve got this\nattentive engagement with things, with us and with novel objects that makes it\nvery hard not to think that there\u2019s quite a lot going on inside them,\u201d he\nsaid. He noted that recent papers looking at pain and dreamlike states in\noctopuses and cuttlefish \u201cpoint in the same direction ... toward experience as\nbeing a real part of their lives.\u201d\n\nWhile many of the animals mentioned in the declaration have brains and nervous\nsystems that are very different from those of humans, the researchers say that\nthis needn\u2019t be a barrier to consciousness. For example, a bee\u2019s brain\ncontains only about a million neurons, compared to some 86 billion in the case\nof humans. But each of those bee neurons may be as structurally complex as an\noak tree. The network of connections they form is also incredibly dense, with\neach neuron contacting perhaps 10,000 or 100,000 others. The nervous system of\nan octopus, by contrast, is complex in other ways. Its organization is highly\ndistributed rather than centralized; a severed arm can exhibit many of the\nbehaviors of the intact animal.\n\nRecent research on animal minds \u2014 including those of crayfish, octopuses,\nsnakes and fish \u2014 suggests that consciousness \u201ccan exist in a [neural]\narchitecture that looks completely alien\u201d to ours, Peter Godfrey-Smith said.\n\nClockwise from top left: Svetlana123/iStock; Colin Marshal/Biosphoto/Science\nSource; MATTHIASRABBIONE/iStock; Jim Maley/iStock\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe upshot, Andrews said, is that \u201cwe might not need nearly as much equipment\nas we thought we did\u201d to achieve consciousness. She noted, for example, that\neven a cerebral cortex \u2014 the outer layer of the mammalian brain, which is\nbelieved to play a role in attention, perception, memory and other key aspects\nof consciousness \u2014 may not be necessary for the simpler phenomenal\nconsciousness targeted in the declaration.\n\n\u201cThere was a big debate about whether fish are conscious, and a lot of that\nhad to do with them lacking the brain structures that we see in mammals,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cBut when you look at birds and reptiles and amphibians, they have very\ndifferent brain structures and different evolutionary pressures \u2014 and yet some\nof those brain structures, we\u2019re finding, are doing the same kind of work that\na cerebral cortex does in humans.\u201d\n\nGodfrey-Smith agreed, noting that behaviors indicative of consciousness \u201ccan\nexist in an architecture that looks completely alien to vertebrate or human\narchitecture.\u201d\n\n## Mindful Relations\n\nWhile the declaration has implications for the treatment of animals, and\nespecially for the prevention of animal suffering, Sebo noted that the focus\nshould go beyond pain. It\u2019s not enough for people to prevent animals in\ncaptivity from experiencing bodily pain and discomfort, he said. \u201cWe also have\nto provide them with the kinds of enrichment and opportunities that allow them\nto express their instincts and explore their environments and engage in social\nsystems and otherwise be the kinds of complex agents they are.\u201d\n\nBut the consequences of bestowing the label of \u201cconscious\u201d onto a wider array\nof animals \u2014 particularly animals whose interests we are not used to\nconsidering \u2014 are not straightforward. For example, our relationship with\ninsects may be \u201cinevitably a somewhat antagonistic one,\u201d Godfrey-Smith said.\nSome pests eat crops, and mosquitoes can carry diseases. \u201cThe idea that we\ncould just sort of make peace with the mosquitoes \u2014 it\u2019s a very different\nthought than the idea that we could make peace with fish and octopuses,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nSimilarly, little attention is given to the well-being of insects such as\nDrosophila, which are widely used in biology research. \u201cWe think about the\nwelfare of livestock and of mice in research, but we never think about the\nwelfare of the insects,\u201d said Matilda Gibbons, who researches the neural basis\nof consciousness at the University of Pennsylvania and has signed the\ndeclaration.\n\n## Related:\n\n  1. ### What Is the Nature of Consciousness?\n\n  2. ### Anil Seth Finds Consciousness in Life\u2019s Push Against Entropy\n\n  3. ### A \u2018Self-Aware\u2019 Fish Raises Doubts About a Cognitive Test\n\n  4. ### The Thoughts of a Spiderweb\n\nWhile scientific bodies have created some standards for the treatment of lab\nmice, it\u2019s not clear if today\u2019s declaration will lead to new standards for the\ntreatment of insects. But new scientific findings do sometimes spark new\npolicies. Britain, for example, enacted legislation to increase protection for\noctopuses, crabs and lobsters after a London School of Economics report\nindicated that those animals can experience pain, distress or harm.\n\nWhile the declaration makes no mention of artificial intelligence, the issue\nof possible AI consciousness has been on the minds of animal-consciousness\nresearchers. \u201cCurrent AI systems are very unlikely to be conscious,\u201d Sebo\nsaid. However, what he\u2019s learned about animal minds \u201cdoes give me pause and\nmakes me want to approach the topic with caution and humility.\u201d\n\nAndrews hopes that the declaration will spark more research into animals that\nhave often been overlooked, a move that has the potential to further expand\nour awareness of the scope of consciousness in the animal world. \u201cAll these\nnematode worms and fruit flies that are in almost every university \u2014 study\nconsciousness in them,\u201d she said. \u201cYou already have them. Somebody in your lab\nis going to need a project. Make that project a consciousness project.
