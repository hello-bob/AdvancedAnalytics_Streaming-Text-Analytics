PERM is a certification process run by the\nDepartment of Labor. It aims to ensure that admitting foreign workers into the\ncountry doesn't impact US workers' job opportunities, wages, or working\nconditions. It's often the first step toward a green card.\n\nEarlier this year, Googlers were told the company wouldn't restart the PERM\nprocess until at least Q1 2025, according to a current employee with direct\nknowledge of the matter. A Google spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Tech companies have been following Google's lead and taking their foot off\nthe pedal in terms of green card applications,\" said Ava Benach, founding\npartner of Benach Collopy, a leading immigration law firm in Washington DC.\n\n\"Google has an outsized influence here,\" she added. \"It has a reputation for\ntreating workers well and leading on these things, so if Google stepped back,\nthen this gives other tech companies cover to step back, too.\"\n\n## Amazon and Meta moves\n\nEarlier this year, Amazon told employees it would continue to pause all new\nPERM filings through 2024, according to an internal announcement seen by\nBusiness Insider.\n\nAmazon said in the memo it had initially paused PERM applications in 2023 and\ndecided to keep these suspended until the end of this year after reviewing\n\"labor market conditions and immigrant requirements.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Meta continues to undertake green card sponsorships for international\nhires, the process has become painfully slow. Getting a green card through\nMeta is now taking \"a year or more,\" a current employee with knowledge of\nMeta's hiring processes said.\n\n## PERM is a lot harder now\n\nA wave of job cuts by Google, Amazon, Meta, and other tech companies has made\nthe PERM process more complicated.\n\nCompanies now have to demonstrate that laid-off employees are not qualified\nfor the jobs intended for foreign workers. They also have to notify people who\nwere laid off in the past six months about job openings before filing PERM\napplications for foreign workers.\n\n\"With more US workers available for open positions, the labor market test\nfails and so the process becomes a waste of time and money for these tech\ncompanies,\" Benach explained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If tech companies have done layoffs relatively recently, they also have to\nnotify laid off workers of new positions that may be going to foreign\nworkers,\" she added. \"If some of these people say 'yes, I'm interested,' then\nyou're out of luck with the green card application.\"\n\nMeta's multiple rounds of mass layoffs reduced the company's headcount by over\n20%. The company is now hiring again, but it is having to work harder to\nexplain to US Citizenship and Immigration Services why international workers\nare needed.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"It's hard to justify PERM after laying off people,\" the Meta employee told\nBI.\n\n## Supply and demand\n\nBig tech companies may also be less willing to pursue green cards because of\nchanges in supply and demand across the tech labor market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe industry went on a record hiring spree in the previous decade, and this\nonly intensified during the pandemic boom. When big tech companies were\nfighting over a limited supply of tech talent, the PERM process was a useful\nweapon to wield.\n\n\"This is a cumbersome, arduous process that no one likes. It often happens\nwhen companies are competing intensely for talent,\" Benach explained. \"Saying\n'we'll do your green card for you,' is a great perk to attract the best tech\nemployees.\"\n\n\"So when, like now, there are more tech workers on the market, these companies\ndon't have to do this as much,\" she added. \"They are not all scrambling for\ntalent anymore, or at least not as much.\"\n\n## Alternatives for foreign tech workers\n\nWhat should foreign tech workers do if their current employer is taking too\nlong with PERM applications, or has stopped the process entirely?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBenach advises candidates to look outside of the Bay Area and New York City\nfor tech jobs in the US. Many other employers across the country need people\nwith science, technology, engineering, and math qualifications, she noted.\n\n\"It's not just Google and the other big Silicon Valley companies,\" Benach\nsaid. \"Other companies in other parts of the country are in desperate need of\ntech workers.\"\n\nLabor market tests for the PERM process are by their nature local. And there\nare fewer tech workers in other parts of the country, with some people\nunwilling to move far for jobs. So this makes the green card process\npotentially easier outside of places like the Bay Area and NYC, she explained.\n\n## Big Tech is trying alternatives, too\n\nIn an email to BI, an Amazon spokesperson said the company is working with\naffected employees to find \"alternative immigration pathways\" to extend their\nstay in the US.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo get around PERM hurdles, some companies are opting to classify\ninternational hires as applicants for a National Interest Waiver, the Meta\nemployee noted.\n\nAn NIW application can be done without corporate sponsorship, so an employee\ncan \"self-petition\" without a specific job offer in hand. This process\nclassifies foreign candidates as people with specific skills and experience\nthat would benefit the US if they became permanent residents.\n\nNIW applications jumped in 2023, according to data from the US Citizenship and\nImmigration Services.\n\n## Google wants to change the roles\n\nGoogle is trying to fix PERM bottlenecks. On Wednesday, it filed a letter with\nthe Department of Labor arguing for changes that broaden the list of roles\nthat can be fast-tracked to a green card.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis \"Schedule A\" list focuses on jobs the Labor Department considers to be\npoorly supplied with talent. It hasn't been updated in 20 years, and Google\nargues the list hasn't evolved to meet the needs of the modern labor market.\n\nGoogle is in particular need of AI experts and the company says it will be\nhard to hire them all.\n\n\"We project that our need for AI Engineer roles, including Software Engineer,\nResearch Engineer, and Research Scientist roles, will increase significantly\nin the coming years,\" Google wrote in the letter. \"AI advancements offer\nincredible promise, but the lack of skilled professionals threatens to hinder\ntheir full potential.\"\n\nAre you a foreign tech worker struggling with a green card application?
