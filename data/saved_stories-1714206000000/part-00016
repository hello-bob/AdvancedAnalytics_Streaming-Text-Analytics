The notebook folder contains Jupyer notebooks with examples\ndemonstrating how to access token dataset and prompting a trained Searchformer\nmodel. This folder also contains notebooks that read data from MongoDB to\ngenerate all figures included in the main paper.\n\nThe searchformer module contains all code used in the presented experiments.\nPlease refer to the documentation in the folder doc for using this module to\ntrain models, evaluate them, and generate training datasets.\n\n## Setup and installation\n\nThis code base uses python=3.10. To run python code and the included Jupyer\nnotebooks, a virtual environment can be created using the included\nrequirements.txt file. For example, this virtual environment can be created\nwith\n\n    \n    \n    $ python3.10 -m venv venv $ source venv/bin/activate (venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nFor the code to run correctly, a MongoDB instance needs to be setup. This code\nbase is designed to work with MongoDB Community Edition and connects by\ndefault directly to mongodb://localhost:27017/mongo without any user\nauthentication setup. For example, to explore the included token datasets and\ncheckpoints, a MonogDB instance could be installed locally in a laptop and\nthis code base can be used to access a MongoDB instance running on localhost.\nTo direct the searchformer module to connect to a different MongoDB instance,\nthe default MongoDB URI can be overwritten by setting the environment variable\n\n    \n    \n    export MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mongo\n\nbefore running any python code. The code segment used for connecting to\nMongoDB can be found in searchformer.utils in function mongodb_client.\n\nTo import the released datasets the command line tool mongorestore is used.\nInstructions for downloading and installing MongoDB Database Tools can be\nfound here.\n\nAs a convention, all commands are run from this repository's root directory\nand not from any sub-directory. The root directory is the directory that\ncontains this README file.\n\nFor example, a correct setup of the python environment can be tested by\nrunning the following from the repositories root directory:\n\n    \n    \n    $ python -m searchformer.train --help Usage: python -m searchformer.train [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]... Options: --help Show this message and exit. Commands: bulk-drop-run Drop multiple training runs. bulk-export-checkpoint Bulk export of all checkpoints into current... bulk-import-checkpoint Bulk import checkpoints from directory. drop-run Drop individual training run. export-checkpoint Export a checkpoint stored in MongoDB to a file. import-checkpoint Import a checkpoint into MongoDB from file. list-all List all training runs. list-all-checkpoints List all stored checkpoints. single Start single DDP training run. sweep Start single DDP training run with provided...\n\n## Getting started\n\nWe have included Jupyter notebooks in the notebook folder. These notebooks\ncontain instructions how to download and populate the MongoDB instance with\nour datasets and how to access the data. The following notebooks are included:\n\n  * notebook/ExampleLoadCheckpoint.ipynb: Loading and prompting a search-augmented model with a 10x10 maze navigation task.\n  * notebook/ExampleRolloutDatasets.ipynb: Loading rollout datasets with the generated response sequences.\n  * notebook/ExampleTokenDatasets.ipynb: Loading token datasets used for training.\n  * notebook/Maze.ipynb: Generating all figures contained in the paper regarding any of the maze experiments.\n  * notebook/PerfTable.ipynb: Generating the table with the presented performance numbers.\n  * notebook/Searchformer.ipynb: Generating figures related to the Searchformer experiments.\n  * notebook/SearchformerScatter.ipynb: Generating scatter plot figure related to the Searchformer experiments.\n  * notebook/TraceComparison.ipynb: Generating box plots showing token sequence lengths for different datasets.\n\nThe doc folder contains documentation about the rest of the code base:\n\n  * doc/train.md: Outlines how to run the training loop for each model.\n  * doc/rollout.md: Outlines how to generate response sequence datasets using the trained checkpoints.\n  * doc/trace_generation.md: Outlines how to generate the used training data.\n  * doc/sokoban.md: We include a small example to play a Sokoban level from the training data interactively.\n  * doc/mongodb.md: Provides an overview of the included datasets with download links.\n  * doc/checkpoint_index.csv: Lists all included checkpoints with download links.\n\n## License\n\nSee the LICENSE file for details about the license under which this code is\nmade available.\n\n## Citation\n\nIf you find this repository useful in your research, please consider giving a\nstar \u2b50 and a citation\n\n    \n    \n    @misc{lehnert2024beyondastar, title={Beyond A*: Better Planning with Transformers via Search Dynamics Bootstrapping}, author={Lucas Lehnert and Sainbayar Sukhbaatar and DiJia Su and Qinqing Zheng and Paul Mcvay and Michael Rabbat and Yuandong Tian}, year={2024}, eprint={2402.14083}, archivePrefix={arXiv}, primaryClass={cs.AI} }\n\n## About\n\nOfficial codebase for the paper \"Beyond A* Better Planning with Transformers\nvia Search Dynamics Bootstrapping\".\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nView license\n\n### Code of conduct\n\nCode of conduct\n\n### Security policy\n\nSecurity policy\n\nActivity\n\nCustom properties\n\n### Stars\n\n3 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n2 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n0 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n  * Jupyter Notebook 98.7%\n  * Python 1.3%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
