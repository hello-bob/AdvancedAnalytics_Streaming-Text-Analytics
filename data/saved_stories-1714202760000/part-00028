Wishlist now to be\nnotified on release.\n\nWhat would happen if we could throw entire stacks of people around? Ridiculous\nsports are what would happen. In Grab n' Throw, take on the role of an athlete\nwith Totally Natural upper body strength and play the full-contact games of\nthe near-future against human and AI players.\n\n  * Fluid movement - Jump from teammate to teammate, grab, throw, all in first-person.\n  * Bulk Interactivity - Interact with the environment. If it exists, you can probably do something with it. Everything in videogames should be interactive!\n  * Variety - Rotate through a bunch of fun gamemodes with your friends.\n  * Sustainable multiplayer - Buying a primarily-multiplayer indie game is a risk. What if there aren't any players? Grab n' Throw is designed with this in mind!\n\n    * If a new session has to be started you get immediately thrown into a match against crafty AI while waiting.\n    * Match-making fills empty waiting sessions first to ensure everyone has someone to play with.\n    * Each game is designed to be fun with just two players, and scale up from there.\n  * Utility and GOAP AI - Play against cunning, responsive AI that makes choices based on the state of the game and the expected value of each action, then dynamically plans how to achieve them!\n\n  * Hole in One - Throw force is cranked up massively! Fly through the air, kilometres at a time, and try to land in a golf hole that moves further and further away. Make your way across a 256 km^2 map, bounce off randomly placed surfaces, and score extra points for holes-in-one and making the longest throw!\n  * Bombarda - Dodgeball crossed with soccer, except instead of balls you throw stacks of your own team-mates, and every goal tilts the whole field against you! Take the offensive and try to win on goals, or hang back and smash into the other team to beat them with outs!\n  * Volley Bash - Throw your team-mates across the net to score goals by slamming into the ground!\n  * Lawyer Launch - Run through a high-rise office building and hurl more lawyers out of windows than your opponents!\n  * More to come!\n\nWishlist and join the Discord to be the first to get invited to upcoming\nbetas.\n\nCover art by Zefanya Maega.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n## System Requirements\n\nMinimum:\n\n    * OS *: Windows 10 (maybe down to 7?)\n    * Processor: Core i3\n    * Memory: 8 GB RAM\n    * Graphics: GTX 950M (and probably lower too)\n    * DirectX: Version 11\n    * Network: Broadband Internet connection\n    * Storage: 5 GB available space\n\n* Starting January 1st, 2024, the Steam Client will only support Windows 10 and later versions.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nCopyright 2022 Golden Syrup Games\n\nREAD MORE\n\nSee all\n\n## More like this\n\n#### Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six\u00ae Siege\n\n19,99\u20ac\n\n#### EA SPORTS FCTM 24\n\n69,99\u20ac\n\n#### BattlefieldTM 2042\n\n59,99\u20ac\n\n#### F1\u00ae 23\n\n69,99\u20ac\n\n#### NBA 2K24\n\n59,99\u20ac\n\n#### Garry's Mod\n\n9,99\u20ac\n\n#### Undisputed\n\n39,99\u20ac\n\n#### Gorilla Tag\n\n19,50\u20ac\n\n#### Party Animals\n\n17,99\u20ac\n\n#### RaceRoom Racing Experience\n\n#### Midnight Ghost Hunt\n\n19,99\u20ac\n\n#### Forza Horizon 4\n\n-67%\n\n69,99\u20ac\n\n23,09\u20ac\n\nView all\n\n## What Curators Say\n\n1 Curator has reviewed this product.
