Curry III Distinguished Fellow in Strategy and Statesmanship\n\nWalter Russell Mead\n\nCaption\n\n(Wikimedia Commons)\n\nReferring to polling data indicating that Sweden was the least religious\ncountry in the world and India the most, sociologist Peter Berger used to say\nthat the United States was a nation of Indians ruled by Swedes. It remains the\ncase today that many members of the American intellectual, administrative,\nfinancial, and even creative elites are unengaged with organized religion on a\npersonal basis and, more consequentially, are only dimly aware of the profound\nand pervasive impact that religion has on domestic and international politics.\n\nThat blind spot is exceptionally dangerous in the 21st century. As American\nsociety faced major economic and social changes in the past, religious\nrevivals transformed old religious communities as new religions and\ndenominations sprang up. Today we are facing another such upheaval as the\nshadow of the singularity and the transformational forces of the Information\nRevolution shake the foundations of American life.\n\nThe decline of old denominations, the rise of new ones, religious\npolarization, and violence are not new in American history. The early republic\nsaw the rise of Baptist, Wesleyan, African Methodist Episcopal, and Unitarian\ncongregations as Anglicans, Congregationalists, Quakers, and Presbyterians\nlost ground. Waves of immigrants made the Roman Catholic Church the largest\nreligious body in what, historically, had been the most vehemently anti-papal\nsociety on earth. The Pentecostal movement that originated among mixed-race\ncongregations in early-20th-century Los Angeles is today the fastest-growing\nreligious movement in the history of the world. The civil rights movement and\nthe Great Awokening both echoed earlier fights in religious communities over\nsecession and slavery, while the trans movement challenges deeply rooted and\nwidely shared moral beliefs in much the same way Joseph Smith and his\nestimated 40 wives challenged the consensus of their day, when early Latter-\nday Saints believers were persecuted, driven from their homes, and sometimes\nmurdered.\n\nBut even by these volatile standards, something more consequential seems to be\nhappening in the 21st century. It is not just that mainline Protestantism,\nEvangelical Protestantism, and American Catholicism are simultaneously\nundergoing crises. It is not just that feminism and the LGBTQ+ movements in\ntheir dizzying proliferation challenge historic Christian beliefs. It is not\nonly that the hedonistic, consumer-oriented focus of blue model society places\nthe satisfaction of individual desire at the moral center of American life.\nOur singularity-haunted century is a time of exhilarating dreams as well as\nhorrifying nightmares, as possibilities ranging from nuclear annihilation and\ncatastrophic climate change to the abolition of inequality and the indefinite\nextension of the human life span appear to depend, increasingly, on the\noutcome of mere political battles.\n\nIt is no wonder that Americans from every camp, and some with a foot in more\nthan one, are struggling to come to terms with the kind of eruption of\nfanaticism and extremism into our political life that we would normally\nassociate with religious upheavals. On one side there are people who insist\nthat to say men can\u2019t give birth is to commit an unspeakable hate crime; on\nanother there are those who are ready to organize for a civil war against the\nforces of wokeness. Growing numbers of liberal Democrats fear that Republican\nvictory in the next election will bring American democracy to an end even as\nunchecked climate change threatens to make the planet uninhabitable; many\nRepublicans fear that a prolongation of Democratic rule will mean that trans\nactivists, unchecked illegal immigration, the collapse of law enforcement, and\nthe relentless lust for power by the Deep State will crush what is left of\nAmerican freedom.\n\nMost of us, thankfully, want nothing to do with the fringe on either side, but\nit is hard to resist the feeling that Yeats\u2019 poem \"The Second Coming\" is more\nrelevant than ever: The center doesn\u2019t hold; the best have lost all conviction\nwhile the worst are full of passionate intensity. We stand, it increasingly\nappears, on the edge of history, and the political stakes are approaching the\ninfinite.\n\nThis is not a temporary aberration. The specifics may change; radical trans\nactivists and Donald Trump will not occupy center stage from decade to decade.\nBut as America and the world ride the Adams Curve up an evermore dizzying\nslope, new hopes, new fears, and new conflicts will replace the old ones, and\nhumanity will remain balanced on a knife edge between triumph and despair. Who\nknows whether our society will become less or more formally religious as time\ngoes by; but I am reasonably certain that the sense that infinite values\ndepend on the outcome of political struggles will continue to whip us into\npolitical frenzies as our political disagreements take on, more and more, the\nintensity that in the past was reserved for wars of religion.\n\nThis is a bad time to be Swedish. Under contemporary conditions, the\npsychological and political significance of religious sentiment and perception\nis too important to ignore, but many American intellectuals will struggle to\nwrap their heads around such an unfamiliar and alien subject\u2014even as the\nAmerican educational system increasingly fails to provide students with a\nsolid introduction to the social power of religious ways of thought.\n\nIt may be helpful for more secular readers to think of \u201creligion\u201d not as\nsomeone\u2019s adherence to a specific creed or cult, but as a universal\ncharacteristic of human consciousness from which our beliefs about good and\nevil and justice and injustice emerge. We are not often aware of the deep\nroots of our sense of identity and connectedness to the world, but our\nintuitions, ideas, and emotions about our relationship to existence are\nconstantly shaping our perceptions of and judgments about our own conduct,\nthat of other people, our political loyalties and opinions, the legitimacy of\nsocial and political institutions, and our duties and our rights. As a result,\nour senses of justice and legitimacy are deeply connected to our religious\nsense, and religion is both an intimate, highly personal phenomenon and a\nmassively powerful social and political force.\n\nReligion in this broad sense is something that virtually everyone shares, but\nAmerican culture and politics have been shaped by a more specific form of the\nreligious sense grounded in the traditions that reflect the legacy of\nAbrahamic religion. No cultural development since the advent of writing rivals\nthe importance or impact of the Abrahamic tradition. The political,\nscientific, moral, and philosophical consequences of the emergence of Judaism,\nChristianity, and Islam (and their close cousins, Liberalism and Marxism) are\nalmost incomprehensibly large. By the beginning of the 21st century, more than\nhalf of the living human race (2.2 billion Christians, 1.6 billion Muslims,\nand 14 million Jews) belonged to one of the Abrahamic religions. Despite the\ndefections from Christianity in parts of the West, globally the numbers\ncontinue to grow.\n\nIt is difficult if not impossible to grasp the direction and the dimensions of\nworld history, to say nothing of American history and contemporary\ndevelopments, without coming to terms with the peculiar form of monotheistic\nreligion associated with the wandering herdsman widely considered by Jewish,\nChristian, and Muslim believers to be the father of their respective faiths.\nIt is out of the Abrahamic world that America\u2019s religious, civic, and\npolitical culture have emerged, and if we want to grasp the nature of the\nforces that both unite and divide us today, we will need to come to grips with\nthe reality that we are, whether we like it or not, the heirs of Abraham.\n\n\u201cHear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One,\u201d is the classic\nstatement of Jewish faith. \u201cI believe in One God,\u201d is the opening of the\nclassic formulation of Christian doctrine known as the Nicene Creed, repeated\nevery Sunday by congregations all over the world. \u201cThere is no god but Allah,\u201d\nis how the Islamic statement of faith opens.\n\nThe belief that there is one all-powerful, all-knowing God, the Lord of Time\nand the Ruler of the Universe\u2014who, acting alone and without aid, made\neverything that exists\u2014is, whether one personally agrees with it or not, the\nmost consequential idea ever to thrust its way into human consciousness.\n\nI don\u2019t mean by this statement to disparage Hindu, Buddhist, or other non-\nAbrahamic belief systems. Ancient Greek philosophers found their own way to\nthe concept of a unitary divine being without, so far as is known, direct\nexposure to Abrahamic religion. Similarly, philosophers and mystics in the\ngreat Asian traditions arrived at their own ways of understanding that unity\nof power, benevolence, and wisdom the family of Abraham worships as God. But\nAbrahamic religion puts the unity of God at the center of popular piety,\ngreatly intensifying the power of this world-altering concept to reshape the\nsocial and intellectual landscape of a given culture.\n\nAs a grand hypothesis that claims to provide a single explanation for\neverything that happens in the heavens and on earth, the monotheistic idea is,\nfor one thing, a daring leap that opens the door to a world of speculation and\nresearch\u2014a path from tinkering to science. Postulating a single creator for\nthe entire universe leads to the belief that the universe is predictable and\nrule driven. Events in the natural world are not just one darn thing after\nanother; they do not reflect the caprices of minor deities. There are laws of\nnature, and because human beings are created by God\u2014and in the Abrahamic\nreligious accounts we were created in God\u2019s image\u2014most if not all of those\nrules should be discoverable by the human mind. The mathematical reasoning\nthat we do in our heads corresponds with the mathematical structure that\nexists in the external world, and the experimental results we obtain in our\nlabs here on earth can help us understand the nature of quasars at the far\nends of the universe.\n\nSimilarly, in philosophy the idea that there is one all-powerful and self-\nsufficient God who created humanity in his image serves to stimulate the quest\nfor truth. Our minds may not be able to plumb the full depths of divine\ntranscendence, but the correspondence between creature and creator, a\ncorrespondence that includes the faculty of reason, means that as far as our\nminds can reach, they can discern the truth. Reconciling the scriptures of the\ngreat Abrahamic religions with the conclusions of Greek philosophers was the\nbusiness of Jewish, Islamic, and Christian thinkers well past the classical\nperiod. The works of Maimonides, Averro\u00ebs, and Aquinas, each representing the\nculmination of centuries of reflection, still stand as massive monuments in\nthe history of human thought and continue to shape and inspire philosophers\nand political thinkers to this day.\n\nAbrahamic thought and religion are as foundational and constitutive in the\nworlds of politics and history as they are for science and philosophy.\nAbrahamic religion holds that every human being matters, is a direct object of\nconcern and care by the Creator of the universe, and is an immortal soul whose\nfate has eternal significance\u2014and that the history of the human race is a\nmoral and ethical story with a purpose and a meaning. Those are genuinely\nworld-shaking convictions, and people who have never read a word of the\nAbrahamic scriptures or darkened the doorways of an Abrahamic house of worship\nlive in a world shaped by Abrahamic values and ideas.\n\nWomen matter. Peasants matter. Slaves matter. Social divisions like race,\ncaste, and wealth are evanescent. God judges impartially between rich and\npoor, and every human being lives under the same moral law. Every human being\nhas rights by divine decree that do not depend on or proceed from the will of\nthe state. Rulers are accountable before God not only for their personal\nconduct but also for the consequences of their policies on the poor and the\nweak. These are radical ideas, and they have touched off more than one\nrevolution in the long course of history. They continue to subvert tyrannies\nand challenge hierarchies of privilege in our time. In my opinion, the\nAbrahamic political revolution will continue as long as imperfect human social\norders fail to live up to the requirements of Abrahamic justice.\n\nBut Abrahamic politics is not just about the rights of individuals and the\npoor. Abrahamic thought gives meaning to the entire span of human existence:\nCreated without sin in perfect harmony with nature and God, humanity\ntragically lost that original connection early on and was plunged into the\nworld of greed, confusion, evil, and chaos that we know. God, however, has\ndetermined not to leave us in this wretched state and has reached out to the\nworld through prophets and lawgivers to set us on the right track. At some\npoint, God will intervene decisively to restore order and justice to the\nworld.\n\nHumanity\u2019s life on earth is therefore divided into three eras. There is the\nprehistorical era in which our earliest ancestors lived in harmony with God\nand inhabited Paradise. The Fall precipitated the era of history in which we\nnow live. In this time, humanity, thanks to God\u2019s mercy and grace, struggles\ntoward a purpose. During this time, the actions of citizens and governments\ncan either advance or retard that purpose. We all have a moral duty to\ncooperate with the divine plan and, so far as we are able, advance the work of\nrecovery and repair. The end of history will come when God intervenes to bring\nhistory to its glorious conclusion.\n\nJews, Muslims, and Christians of course disagree vehemently over the specifics\nof the divine plan, but the Abrahamic approach to history is something they\nbasically share. The human story is not just a set of random events, nor is it\na cyclical process. A moral imperative is encoded into history; individuals\nand states are either acting in accordance with divine mandates or in\nviolation of them.\n\nThese beliefs lead the followers of these traditions to bring ethical ideals\ninto public policy and diplomacy. They also lead to wars of religion as\nAbrahamic believers seek to impose their moral and religious visions around\nthe world. The Abrahamic vision of history is so powerful and corresponds so\ndeeply to the intuitions that many people have about the world, moreover, that\neven those who reject these religious doctrines embrace the historical and\npolitical visions that Abrahmists propose.\n\nWhen Francis Fukuyama greeted the end of the Cold War by suggesting that the\nend of history was upon us, he was consciously referring to the Abrahamic\nschema of history. German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel built his\nphilosophical system on the foundation of the Abrahamic historical vision. His\nidea of the end of history\u2014the point where human society had developed to its\nintended perfection under the guidance of the Spirit that expressed itself\nthrough the historical process\u2014is nothing more than the old Abrahamic idea of\nthe arrival of a divinely perfected earthly order in philosophical robes.\n\nHegel was neither the first nor the last European thinker to recast Abrahamic\nhistory into political terms in the wake of the Enlightenment. Liberals in the\nUnited States and beyond saw in the integrated scientific, technological, and\nsocial progress of their times the signs of a progressive and permanent change\nin the human condition. Scientific knowledge would create a more prosperous\nworld. That prosperity would enable the spread of education and enlightenment\nto the masses. With time, the combination of free markets and free\ninstitutions would bring an end to poverty, tyranny, and war even as\nscientists learned to cure sickness and extend the human life span.\n\nLiberals were not the only children of the Enlightenment to build an\nessentially secular worldview on Abrahamic foundations. Karl Marx, who saw his\nlife\u2019s work as integrating the German philosophical tradition with the British\npolitical economy, was if anything more explicit than Hegel in recapitulating\nthe Abrahamic outline of history. Marx and his colleague Friedrich Engels\npictured humanity as moving from stage to stage toward the final classless\nutopia of universal peace and abundance. Early humans were hunters and\ngatherers, living in a classless and Edenic \u201cprimitive communism\u201d of relative\nequality and peace. The Neolithic Revolution and the rise of the ancient\nempires forced humanity out of the Garden of Eden and into the misery of class\noppression and war. But that was not the end of the story. While neither an\nAbrahamic God nor a Hegelian Spirit was guiding us, the material progress of\nthe human race was gradually but inexorably laying the foundation for the\nreturn by a fully developed, scientifically managed future human society to a\nsophisticated version of primitive communism.\n\nSt. Augustine saw human history as a long march from the Garden of Eden at the\nbeginning of time to the City of God at the culmination of history. Marx saw a\nsimilar progression from the rural but primitive paradise of the hunter-\ngatherers to the glittering communist metropolis of the future.\n\nLiberals and Marxists also carry the ethical imperatives of the Abrahamic\nworldview into their political visions. From their viewpoint, human beings\nhave a duty to assist the arrival of utopia. Rulers who fight to save their\nbackward autocracies are not just wasting their time fighting the inevitable\ntide. They are doing something evil, and it is the duty of good and honorable\npeople to resist them.\n\nThis is why in my view Liberalism and Marxism deserve a place in the\nquarrelsome, divided family of Abraham. They resemble the religions descended\nfrom Abraham in their claims of universal and exclusive truth, in their\nunshakeable belief in their right to dictate morals and politics to the world,\nand in their confidence that at the end of the day their visions will triumph\nover their rivals\u2019.\n\nAs the five Abrahamic faiths have spread around the world, the influence of\nthese ideas has grown. If we add Communist China and proponents of liberal\ndemocracy to the Abrahamic West, Middle East, and Africa, where Christianity\nand Islam have largely replaced indigenous religions, it should be clear just\nhow pervasive the legacy of Abraham has become.\n\n\u201cLook up to the heavens,\u201d the Voice had said to Abraham (as translated by\nRobert Alter), \u201cand count the stars, if you can count them.\u201d That, the Voice\nsaid, will be the number of your descendants. And on another occasion: \u201cI will\nmake you most abundantly fruitful and turn you into nations, and kings shall\ncome forth from you.\u201d Scholars differ on whether and how much the story\nreflects an actual series of historical events, but whether the Voice was a\ndivine call, a herdsman\u2019s imagination, or an episode in a legendary cycle with\nno discernible historical foundation, the past 4,000 years have seen this\nprediction fulfilled.\n\nNot every consequence of this astonishing development has been benign. The\nfamily of Abraham is uniquely large and uniquely influential. It is also\nuniquely truculent. Abraham\u2019s putative descendants warred across the deserts\nof the Middle East for thousands of years, and Christians and Muslims have\nbeen calling holy wars against one another since the first Islamic armies\nswept out of the Arabian Peninsula nearly 1,400 years ago.\n\nHuman beings fought wars long before Abraham followed his flocks into Canaan,\nbut the belief in a single Creator introduced a new source of conflict into\nthe world. If there is one God who is entirely good and who is actively\nintervening in human history, then we really ought to follow his commandments.\nThere is one truth that ought to be known and believed by all people, and\nthere is a right way to live to which all people ought to conform.\n\nThe pagan priests of Jupiter did not believe that all people should worship\nthe same god. Nor did they care if the rites by which Jupiter was worshipped\nin Rome differed from those used in his temples in Naples. The Romans and\ntheir neighbors fought over honor, territory, security, and wealth; they did\nnot fight over religion. Shinto priests today have no desire to convert the\nworld to their belief system. It is the heirs of Abraham\u2014including Liberals\nand Marxists\u2014who believe that the world\u2019s welfare requires the global\ndissemination of their faith and who have often felt compelled to spread that\nfaith by fire and the sword.\n\nWhile Abrahamic thought and religion remain central to American identity, we\nmust remember that the United States is only one of many countries around the\nworld whose political ideologies and self-image are grounded in Abrahamic\nimagery and thought. The ancient Hebrews, the Islamic caliphates down to the\nOttoman era, the Byzantine and Russian emperors, and the Habsburgs all\nbelieved that their states represented the culmination of a divine purpose. In\nthe American case, the primary sources of American social and political\nthought\u2014the Protestant version of Western Christianity, Enlightenment\nLiberalism, and various forms of progressive ideology ranging from middle-\nclass reformers like John Dewey to the Marxist and quasi-Marxist hard left\u2014all\nsaw the nation\u2019s history as part of a cosmic story taking place within the\nAbrahamic framework.\n\nFor our predecessors, the arc of history seemed clear. The great civilizations\nof the Greco-Roman world had reached an apex of cultural and political\naccomplishment, just as the pure religion of the early Christian church marked\na spiritual high point in humanity\u2019s long, divinely assisted recovery from the\nFall. But the promise of the classical era had been cut short. Corruption and\ndecadence brought an end to the liberties of the ancient peoples, while the\ngradual corruption of the early church under the influence of tyrannical\nemperors and scheming clerics led to what American Protestants saw as the\nevils and errors of the medieval church.\n\nThe barbarian invasions marked the fall of the ancient Greco-Roman\ncivilization even as the consolidation of papal power marked the degradation\nof Christianity and left Western civilization in the shadow of the Dark Ages.\nBut the early Americans believed that this was not the end of the story. The\nscholars and humanists of the Renaissance began to recover the ideas of the\nancients from obscurity. The Protestant Reformation inaugurated the process of\nrecovering the early purity and power of the Christian faith.\n\nThe intellectual and spiritual recovery led to the rebirth of the ancient\nspirit of republican liberty and, Americans believed, the virtue that made\nliberty possible. American and British observers both saw the Glorious\nRevolution of 1688\u2014when James II was overthrown after the defeat of his plans\nto establish absolute monarchy and break the power of Protestantism, and\nParliament emerged as the most important center of power in British\npolitics\u2014as a decisive victory over the forces of superstition and tyranny,\nopening the way to accomplishments even greater than the greatest achievements\nof the ancient world.\n\nBetween the Glorious Revolution and the American Revolution almost 90 years\nlater, the fruits of the new order seemed to explode across the historical\nstage as the scientific and intellectual accomplishments of the Enlightenment\nastounded contemporaries. From Sir Isaac Newton\u2019s discoveries in mathematics\nand physics to Adam Smith\u2019s groundbreaking work in political economy, from\nJames Watt\u2019s development of a more efficient steam engine to John Harrison\u2019s\ncreation of chronometers accurate enough to permit ship captains to determine\ntheir longitude on extended voyages, one astonishing innovation after another\nelectrified the European world and pointed toward even greater accomplishments\nstill to come.\n\nThe American colonists could not help but see these phenomena through the\nprism of Abrahamic thought. History was not a random series of unrelated\nevents. The hand of God (or the finger of an equally powerful and mysterious\nfate) was guiding this process of recovery, renewal, and accelerating\nadvancement. As they looked forward, the colonists and the early Americans\nbelieved that they were fated to play a decisive role in the future and\nfurther unfolding of the most remarkable era of progress in the history of the\nworld. The realities of geography and demography indicated that the American\nrepublic would become one of the largest and most populous countries on earth.\nTheir unique hold on the world-transforming principles of the spirit of the\nReformation and Enlightenment meant that their society would long continue as\na font of innovation and a beacon of liberty to the rest of the world.\n\nThe United States of America, many of its citizens believed, was not fated to\nbecome just one powerful country among many empires that rose and strutted\ntheir brief hour on the stage before fading into historical memory. The United\nStates had come onto the world stage with unprecedented potential at the\nmoment when Abrahamic history was moving toward its final, climactic\nfulfillment.\n\nThis vision of America\u2019s role in the world resonated with the major religious\nand philosophical currents of the early years of the republic. Orthodox\nProtestants coming out of Calvinist, Lutheran, Anglican, Wesleyan, and\nAnabaptist traditions found nothing strange or unsettling in a political\nvision that placed the Reformation at the center of modern history. Less\nconventionally religious children of the enlightenment like Benjamin Franklin\nand Thomas Jefferson were equally at home with the vision. Providential\nliberal nationalism, this belief that God or fate was leading the United\nStates to play a transformative role in the consummation of world history,\nbecame an essential element of our national culture.\n\nThese beliefs would only tighten their grip on the national imagination in the\ngenerations following the revolution. The United States kept growing richer\nand more powerful as world history seemed to move ever closer to a dramatic\nclimax. The titanic scale of the wars of the 20th century, the horrors of\ntotalitarian Nazism and Communism, and the apocalyptic peril represented by\nthe development of nuclear weapons all dramatically underscored the movement\ntoward some kind of historical culmination. The approach of a grand climax to\nworld history\u2014whether one anticipates the establishment of a peaceful and\nprosperous democratic utopia or fears global destruction in the fires of\nnuclear war or climate change\u2014makes the Abrahamic schema of history look more\nprobable and adds both credibility and urgency to Abrahamic ideology in all\nits forms. The growing importance of the United States in world politics\nprecisely as the climax of history seemed to inexorably approach reinforced\nAmericans\u2019 sense that their country was destined to play a critical role at\nthis climactic time.\n\nThe 21st century, so far, has seen more of the same. As humanity rides the\nAdams Curve\u2019s accelerating trajectory toward a radically uncertain future, the\nUnited States continues to occupy a unique position in world affairs. Whether\nthe danger is climate change, the rise of uncontrolled artificial\nintelligence, nuclear proliferation, challenges to the \u201crules-based world\norder,\u201d or an increasingly totalitarian China bent on hegemony, the chances of\na benign outcome rest heavily on the position and the performance of the\nUnited States.\n\nTime will tell whether the American sense of mission will prove more accurate\nthan the dreams of the great powers of the past. What matters for contemporary\nAmerican politics is the reality that this vision of the country\u2019s purpose is\nlosing its ability to integrate Americans of many different backgrounds and\nbeliefs into a common national consensus. Tradition-minded Christians,\nEnlightenment liberals, and secular progressives are united today by a feeling\nthat world history is rushing toward a climax and that America has an\nimportant part to play in the drama to come. But there the consensus ends.\nAmerica in the 21st century is as Abrahamic as ever, but that heritage\nincreasingly divides rather than unites us.\n\nThe presence of deep political divides in the United States is something I\u2019ve\nnever been able to ignore. I was born into the staunchly segregationist and\nwhite supremacist culture of the Jim Crow South in 1952, and my earliest\nimpressions of the political and social world were informed by the rapid\ndissolution of an entire world of custom, sentiment, and law. My extended\nfamily was deeply divided by the upheavals of that time as my parents embraced\nthe civil rights movement while my mother\u2019s parents and their relatives were\nslow to accept and, in some cases, fought the change.\n\nFor my parents and many of their friends and contemporaries, such as my\nfather\u2019s seminary classmate Jack Spong, their rejection of the segregationist\nculture of the white supremacist South led to an embrace of theological\nliberalism. For some of my mother\u2019s family, and for many other conservative\nSouthern whites, their continuing loyalty to the Jim Crow system went hand in\nglove with continued adherence to traditional views of biblical inerrancy and\northodox Protestant dogma. As a child I struggled to understand the rifts in\nmy family and the upheavals in the wider world. In the years since, I\u2019ve tried\nto reconcile my growing conviction that the liberal Protestant theology of my\nparents\u2019 generation is too weak to work with my equally robust belief that the\nanti-racist liberals were right about the need to extirpate Jim Crow\nsegregation and the white supremacy that enabled it.\n\nThe turmoil I saw in the white South in the 1950s and 1960s as the civil\nrights revolution overturned the Jim Crow system of racial segregation and\nforced millions of Southern whites to reconsider the morality of once-revered\ncustoms and values was the harbinger of a revolution in values that continues\nto challenge Americans today. For those like my parents who seriously tried to\nunderstand the demands for racial justice, it was not just a problem of\nreckoning with the consequences of segregation and racism against Black\npeople, important as that was. There was also the wrenching question of\nreckoning with the implications of the civil rights movement for the culture\nin which they had grown up.\n\nIf, as was clearly the case, the Jim Crow racial system was a moral\nabomination, what did that say about the values of their parents and\ngrandparents who had accepted and helped in some cases to perpetuate it for so\nmany decades? What was there to say about the preachers who remained silent\nabout this great public evil Sunday after Sunday? And what about those who\ntortured the Scriptures to justify racial discrimination? For Protestants like\nmy parents, taught to rely on the Bible, which was understood in their\ncommunities as the authoritative source of spiritual truth, what did it mean\nthat generations of ministers and theologians had studied the Scriptures\nearnestly and devotedly their whole lives long, yet never noticed that the\nsocial order they upheld was flagrantly evil and unspeakably unjust?\n\nWhite Southerners were not the only people who had to rethink their ideas\nabout the American past in those turbulent years. The version of American\nhistory taught in public schools and promoted in the national media back then\nwas simplistic and boastful. There was little reflection on the shadows in the\nAmerican historical story. The atrocities of slavery, the destruction of\nindigenous peoples, the economic exploitation of poor people and immigrants,\nthe failure to offer equal opportunities to women ... Were these really the\nhallmarks of a providential nation destined to bring light and freedom to the\nworld? As racial violence descended on American cities in the 1960s, as the\nassassinations of President Kennedy, Martin Luther King, and Robert Kennedy\nshocked the country, and as the American engagement in the Vietnam War grew\nbloodier and more controversial, more and more Americans began to question the\nmoral foundations of American society.\n\nThe growing current of skepticism about whether a country with America\u2019s\ncheckered history could claim a leading place in humanity\u2019s struggle for a\nbetter future led to a searching examination of those values themselves. Our\ndemocratic ideology had coexisted with racial discrimination for centuries.\nAmerica\u2019s anticommunist convictions had led the country into the Vietnam War.\nCould the fault lie not just in America\u2019s failure to live up to its values but\nin the values themselves? Was liberal providential nationalism itself a\nsymptom of the sickness and moral failure of American society, a poisonous\nform of national egotism that justified centuries of crimes against Native\nAmericans, Black Americans, and others?\n\nThese questions about the moral foundations of American life led many members\nof the Baby Boom generation to reject the traditional American narratives.\nWhile Soviet Communism had appealed to similarly radicalized Americans in the\n1930s, the sterile Soviet system of the Brezhnev era had few attractions for\nthe Boomers. The New Left, as Boomer radicals became known, was as critical of\nAmerica\u2019s capitalist consumer society as the Old Left had been, and many of\nits members flirted with Cuban and Chinese communism but ultimately looked\nmore to create a new kind of egalitarian, progressive society in the United\nStates rather than imitating existing socialist societies.\n\nBut while a relative handful of radicals joined groups like Students for a\nDemocratic Society, the Black Panther Party, or the Weather Underground, a\nmuch larger number of Americans lost confidence in the cultural and\nideological framework of the past. They also lost faith in the American\ngovernment. The generation that lived through the New Deal and World War II\nbelieved that Washington, D.C., was a force for good in the world. The\ngeneration that lived through the Vietnam War had its doubts.\n\nMeanwhile, another profound change was working its way through American\nsociety. Traditional moral standards had always been honored as much in the\nbreach as in the observance, and it was easier in the past to control the\npublic discussion of sexual behavior than to suppress the behavior itself. But\nwhether or not human nature really changes so much from one generation to the\nnext, American attitudes about sex certainly began to change dramatically in\nthe 1960s. \u201cShacking up\u201d was socially unacceptable in the 1950s, and sexual\npromiscuity and divorce were strongly frowned upon. A generation later they\nhad become commonplace among middle-class youth. Homosexuality began its long\njourney toward acceptance and, ultimately, celebration.\n\nThe reasons for these monumental shifts in public opinion are diverse. The\ndevelopment of antibiotics and oral contraceptives substantially reduced the\nrisks of premarital sex. The lengthening period between the onset of puberty\nand the achievement of full adulthood made the ban on premarital sex much\nharder to sustain, especially in a culture saturated with sexually charged\nadvertising and entertainment. The dignity and courage of so many gay\nAmericans in the face of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and a rejection of the\nprejudice that confronted many of its victims led many Americans to reconsider\nthe deep social prejudice against sexual minorities\u2014and the traditional\nreligious teaching that condemned homosexual activity. The emphasis on\nconsumption and the satisfaction of desire inherent in the mass production,\nmass consumption economic model of the late-20th-century United States also\nmade the advocates of traditional morality seem out of step with the times.\n\nWestern societies had gone through cycles of tight-lipped restraint and ribald\nRabelaisianism in the past. \u201cDost thou think because thou art virtuous there\nshall be no more cakes and ale?\u201d Sir Toby Belch demands of the Puritan steward\nMalvolio in Shakespeare\u2019s Twelfth Night. Ben Jonson\u2019s plays mocked the dour\nself-righteousness and inevitable hypocrisy of Puritans like Tribulation\nWholesome. The puritanism of Oliver Cromwell and John Milton overcame the joie\nde vivre of the Elizabethan age but yielded in its turn to the louche climate\nof the Restoration under Charles II. Regency England was licentious while the\nVictorians were prudish. But what happened in the late-20th-century West was\ndifferent. The proponents of the new morality of the 1960s and beyond did not\nsee themselves as immoralists flouting accepted moral standards. They saw\nthemselves as the true moralists, upholding a higher, better standard of\nconduct than the blinkered and prejudiced proponents of traditional Judeo-\nChristian morality.\n\nThe old morality was, the new moralists suggested, deeply immoral. It\nrepressed women, subjected sexual minorities to cruel persecution, and\nblighted human freedom and creativity by confining the expression of human\nsexuality to a rigid and primitive code.\n\nThe combination of political and moral dissatisfaction with traditional\nAmerican society laid the groundwork for a new synthesis, one that found its\nvoice among the so-called woke. America\u2019s traditional political code was a\nthinly disguised cover for a society based on white supremacy and economic\nexploitation. Traditional American morality was simply the organized\noppression of women and minorities in the service of a hierarchical\npatriarchy. What America needed was a deep reckoning with its problematic\npast, followed by a radical turn toward an entirely different future.\n\nThe Great Awokening of 21st-century America fell on its adherents like the\nreligious revivals of the American past. A sudden awakening to the racial and\neconomic inequalities embedded in American culture led to a dramatic change of\nheart and a new perspective on both morals and politics in much the same way\nthat the audiences of D. L. Moody and Billy Graham had awakened to a new sense\nof sin, of God\u2019s grace, and of a new way to live.\n\nAs had happened in the religious revivals of the past, a sense of an\napocalyptic turning point in world history played a role in the Awokening. For\nmany, this was about climate change. American capitalism with, allegedly, its\nrelentless emphasis on growth, its grounding in systemic racism, and its\nfetishization of consumption was a global force on course to wreck the climate\nand plunge the human race into an apocalyptic catastrophe.\n\nMeanwhile, those who still retained their faith in more traditional forms of\nAmerican ideology and religion increasingly saw the rise of the \u201csuccessor\nideology\u201d of woke anti-capitalism in apocalyptic terms. Believing as they did\nthat the traditional American way of life was a beacon of hope globally and\nthe foundation of American freedom and prosperity at home, upholders of the\nolder American ideology saw the partisans of the Great Awokening as an\nexistential threat to everything they held dear.\n\nBut this does not mean that the United States is doomed to descend into some\nkind of civil war. Our history and our institutions, whatever their flaws,\nprepare us to live with political and cultural dissonance better than most.\nAmerican culture was born out of the firestorm of the British Reformation,\nwhen Protestants and Catholics struggled for supremacy before Britain\u2019s\nProtestants turned on one another in the civil wars of the 17th century. The\nlong struggle for religious and political freedom extending from the reign of\nHenry VIII through the Glorious Revolution left both Britain and America with\nthe ability to manage religious diversity. Ideas like federalism and the\nseparation of church and state can help us manage the conflicts of our time,\njust as they helped our predecessors deal with similar issues in the past.\n\nIf we look back at American history, and at the British history that lies\nbehind it, we see that the pendulum doesn\u2019t continually swing in an ever-\nwidening arc. The kinds of extremism and fanaticism we see today are periodic\nfeatures of our political life, but moderation tends to gradually reappear.\nThe worst excesses of the Puritans and the most tyrannical instincts of the\nruling establishment gradually and almost imperceptibly faded away. American\nhistory is full of examples of bitter foes learning to cooperate on common\nprojects. The conservative evangelicals and Roman Catholics united today in\nthe pro-life movement were once the bitterest of enemies. Common economic\ninterests bring atheists and evangelicals into friendly associations like\nlocal chambers of commerce. Americans of all religions and no religion\ncontinually join together to work on common problems and to pursue common\npolitical and social goals. Those who cling to purist ideologies and cannot or\nwill not enter coalitions end up being marginalized in a political process\nthat requires broad agreement. Even fanatics tire of impotence, and the gentle\nbut unremitting pressure to compromise ultimately makes itself felt.\n\nIt does not pay to be smug about America\u2019s future. The problems before us are\ngrave. But we should remember that no society in the history of the world has\nas much experience as we do in managing the bitter disputes that break out\namong Abraham\u2019s quarrelsome heirs. And if America can manage the raging storms\nof the Information Revolution, renewing our prosperity and rebuilding our\nunity, we can point the way for others. Providential liberal nationalism, like\nAmerica itself, is badly in need of reform, but the United States still has a\nmajor role to play as the human story unfolds. The God of Abraham isn\u2019t\nfinished with us yet.\n\nRead in Tablet.\n\nDomestic Policy\n\nSubscribe\n\nSecurity. Freedom.
