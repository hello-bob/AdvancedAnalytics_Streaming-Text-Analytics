Despite recent worldwide elephant ivory trade bans, mammoth ivory\ntrade remains unregulated. This complicates law enforcement efforts, as\ndistinguishing between ivory from extant and extinct species requires costly,\ndestructive and time consuming methods. Elephant and mammoth ivory mainly\nconsists of dentine, a mineralized connective tissue that contains an organic\ncollagenous component and an inorganic component of calcium phosphate\nminerals, similar in structure to hydroxyapatite crystals. Raman spectroscopy\nis a non-invasive laser-based technique that has previously been used for the\nstudy of bone and mineral chemistry. Ivory and bone have similar biochemical\nproperties, making Raman spectroscopy a promising method for species\nidentification based on ivory. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that it\nis possible to identify differences in the chemistry of mammoth and elephant\nivory using Raman spectroscopy. Mammoth and elephant tusks were obtained from\nthe Natural History Museum in London, UK. Included in this study were eight\nsamples of ivory from Mammuthus primigenius, two samples of carved ivory\nbangles from Africa (Loxodonta species), and one cross section of a tusk from\nElephas maximus. The ivory was scanned using an inVia Raman micro spectrometer\nequipped with a x50 objective lens and a 785nm laser. Spectra were acquired\nusing line maps and individual spectral points were acquired randomly or at\npoints of interest on all samples. The data was then analysed using principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) with use of an in-house MATLAB script. Univariate\nanalysis of peak intensity ratios of phosphate to amide I and III peaks, and\ncarbonate to phosphate peaks showed statistical differences (p<0.0001) in the\naverage peak intensity ratios between Mammuthus primigenius, Loxodonta spp.\nand Elephas maximus. Full width at half maximum hight (FWHM)analysis of the\nphosphate peak demonstrated higher crystal maturity of Mammuthus primigenius\ncompared to living elephant species. The results of the study have established\nthat spectra acquired by Raman spectroscopy can be separated into distinct\nclasses through PCA. In conclusion, this study has shown that well-preserved\nmammoth and elephant ivory has the potential to be characterized using Raman\nspectroscopy, providing a promising method for species identification. The\nresults of this study will be valuable in developing quick and non-destructive\nmethods for the identification of ivory, which will have direct applications\nin archaeology and the regulation of international trade.\n\n## Figures\n\nCitation: Shepherd RF, Lister AM, Roberts AM, Taylor AM, Kerns JG (2024)\nDiscrimination of ivory from extant and extinct elephant species using Raman\nspectroscopy: A potential non-destructive technique for combating illegal\nwildlife trade.

While many countries have in recent years\nrestricted their laws on ivory trade, and most have banned all trade, there\nare often exceptions for antique items or items of cultural significance [1].\nHowever, these ivory trade rules do not apply to extinct species such as\nmammoth ivory [1]. The trade of mammoth ivory is on the increase with the rise\nof \u2018mammoth hunters\u2019 undertaking expeditions through the Siberian arctic to\nharvest mammoth tusks for financial gain [2]. This activity has been made\neasier during recent years, as an increase in global temperatures has resulted\nin thawing of the permafrost [3], revealing almost perfectly preserved mammoth\nspecimens during the summer months. This legal source of ivory poses an\nenforcement problem for border protection and customs teams across the globe,\nas ivory products of these two different types of tusk can be difficult to\ndistinguish from one another visually [4].\n\nTusks are a mineralised connective tissue [5] formed from layers of cementum,\nenamel and dentine, with a medullary pulp cavity occupying the proximal tusk\n[6]. Dentine comprises the bulk of tissue in the tusk. Its microarchitecture\ninvolves dentinal tubules radiating from the pulp cavity to the cementum [7,\n8]. Dentine is formed by odontoblasts, which move centrally as they lay down\nmatrix, and line the medullary cavity; these cells produce collagens type I\nand IV [9] which are subsequently mineralised by calcium phosphate based\ndentinal apatite crystals [10]. In a section of tusk, a checkerboard pattern\nof dark and light lines may be seen radiating from the centre to the\nperiphery. This \u2018Schreger pattern\u2019 is thought to relate to minute shifts in\nthe path of odontoblasts as they deposit dentine during tusk formation.\nCementum is present as a layer surrounding the proximal tusk and its main\nfunction is to attach the tusk root to the maxillary bone. Cementum is formed\nby cementoblasts, and is a softer material than dentine, with a higher\nwater/collagen to mineral ratio (50:50, compared to dentine 5:95). Enamel,\nformed by ameloblasts, is the hardest tissue found in the mammalian body, and\nis almost entirely composed of mineral carbonated phosphate. The dentinal pulp\nis a mass of connective tissue containing nerves and blood vessels, as well as\nthe ondontoblasts.\n\nIvory derives from the tusks (upper incisors) of animals from the Order\nProboscidea. Tusk structures of elephants and mammoth are broadly similar.\nHowever, at a microscopic level, there are differences in the density of\ndentinal tubules [6, 8, 11, 12]. The dentinal tubules in mammoth ivory are\nmore closely packed together than those in modern elephants [11], perhaps\nrelating to behavioural differences which subjected the mammoth tusks to\nhigher loading, such as more fighting or lifting. The Schreger pattern is also\ndifferent in elephant and mammoth ivory.\n\nThe taxonomic Order Proboscidea encompasses mammals with trunks and tusks,\nsuch as the extant African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), African forest\nelephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), as\nwell as many extinct species including the woolly mammoth (Mammuthus\nprimigenius) [13]. Elephants and mammoths initially grow deciduous tusks that\nreach just 5 cm in length. These tusks fall out after one year and the\npermanent tusks continue to grow throughout the elephant\u2019s lifetime.\nInitially, the dentine of a permanent tusk is covered with a thin peripheral\nlayer of cementum and enamel; over time these layers of cementum and enamel\nwear off through use [14]. Both male and female African elephants and mammoths\nhave tusks, while female Asian elephants lack tusks (or have small \u2018tushes\u2019).\nThere are sex differences in the tusks of African elephants; male tusks are\nlarger and increase in circumference and length throughout life, whereas\nfemale tusks are smaller and do not increase in circumference after maturity.\nIn addition, after puberty, the pulp cavity of females begins to fill in with\ncementum, whereas in males it increases in size with age [15]. Similar\ndifferences have been noted in mammoths [16]. Tusks in both sexes are used in\nfeeding and competitively for dominance. Elephants are known to have a\ndominant tusk side; the tusk on the dominant side is often shorter than the\nnon-dominant tusks as it is worn down through greater use [17].\n\nIvory products have historically been popular worldwide. Research conducted by\nthe Worldwide Wildlife Fund has studied consumer behaviour to identify\nreasons, culturally and practically, why the ivory trade still exists [18\u201320].\nThe study showed that buyers are most likely to be women with medium to high\nincomes that live in smaller Chinese cities [20]. These individuals purchase\nivory for a number of reasons, mostly stemming from the historical precedent\nof ivory as a status symbol in the far East, due to its rarity and value, and\nthat it is seen as a safe investment, similar to that of purchasing artwork.\nIvory is also commonly used in traditional medicines, in jewellery, ornaments,\nsmall carvings and figurines, and was historically used in the production of\nobjects such as piano keys and billiard balls. While the use of elephant ivory\nhas decreased due to increased protection and conservation, exploitation of\nthe Siberian permafrost and the organised efforts of the \u2018mammoth hunters\u2019\nhave allowed the mammoth ivory market to flourish.\n\nIn 2017, Palkopolou et al. [13] mapped the genomes data of extinct and living\nelephants. Although it has been estimated that there have been at least 200\ndifferent species of Proboscidea, of which about 40 were elephants, the only\nliving members of this family now are two species of African elephant,\nLoxodonta cyclotis and Loxodonta africana, and one species of Asian elephant,\nElephas maximus (Table 1) [13, 21]. The 2016 African Elephant Database survey\nestimated a total of 410,000 elephants remaining in Africa, a decrease of\napproximately 90,000 elephants from the previous 2013 report [22]. Although\nthe percentage decline in Asian elephants as a result of illegal poaching is\nlower, as females do not have tusks, there has been a 50% decline over the\nlast three generations of Asian elephants.\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT\n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG\n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF\n\noriginal image\n\nTable 1. A partial list of extinct and extant elephant species.\n\nThe list of mammoths details the estimated date of extinction, and the list of\nmodern day elephants gives details of remaining population size and\nInternational Union for Conservation (IUCN) of Nature Red List Assessment.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0299689.t001\n\nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime recommends a variety of\nlaboratory techniques to be used in assessing the legality of ivory in trade\n[23]. These include Schreger line analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)\nspectroscopy, DNA and mtDNA analysis, isotope analysis and Raman spectroscopy,\nthough the recommendations heavily focus on the use of DNA/mtDNA and isotope\nanalysis [23].\n\nThe primary non-destructive method for differentiating between elephant and\nmammoth ivory is based on the difference in the Schreger pattern [23].\nSchreger lines can be divided into outer and inner, depending on whether they\nare found towards the surface or the medulla of the tusk. Outer Schreger lines\ncan be used to distinguish between elephant and mammoth ivory due to a\ndifference in their angles. In elephant ivory, the Schreger lines have an\naverage angle of intersection of 115\u00b0 and form a characteristic \"V\" shape. In\nmammoth ivory, the Schreger lines are more angled and form a \"U\" shape with\nintersections of less than 90\u00b0. However, the inner Schreger lines are not\nuseful in the identification of ivory species. A database of the convex and\nconcave Schreger lines was published identifying the differences between\nelephant and mammoth ivory [4]. However, this method of identification\nrequires a perfect transverse section of tusk, perpendicular to the axis of\nthe tusk [24]. In addition, ivory from another extinct proboscidean, the\nmastodon (Mammut spp.), presents obtuse Schreger angles similar to that of\nelephant [23]. This creates the possibility that well-preserved mastodon ivory\ncould be mistaken as elephant ivory. Ultimately, Schreger line analysis can\nonly differentiate between elephant and mammoth ivory, and other methods are\nrequired for finer-level identification of elephant species and subspecies. In\ncases where orientation of a tusk sample is difficult, DNA identification or\nradiocarbon dating may be sought\u2013but these studies are costly, time consuming\nand destructive.\n\nFTIR and Raman spectroscopy both work through the detection of vibration in\nmolecules, based on either the infra-red absorption or Raman scattering [25].\nUp until ten years ago, Raman spectroscopy was less widely used than FTIR due\nto issues with sample degradation and fluorescence, although modern technology\nhas resolved many of these issues [26]. Modern Raman spectrometers are\nrelatively simple to use and are non-destructive to biological specimens [27].\nThe use of this technique is well documented in the analysis of bone health\n[28\u201330], and spatially offset Raman spectroscopy has been used to give\ndetailed information as to the biochemistry of a specimen below the surface\narea of a tissue [31]. This technique is non-destructive, and can be used in-\nvitro, in-vivo or ex-vivo [31].\n\nRaman spectroscopy is a method of measuring and quantifying changes in energy\nof a light (using a laser) as it is scattered from a material [31, 32]. As the\nlight (photons) interact with molecular bonds, providing energy for them to\nvibrate, energy is lost or gained, which results in a shift in wavelength. The\noutput data, containing information about the different changes in light, is\nreferred to as a Raman \u2018fingerprint\u2019 or \u2018a spectrum\u2019 [31]. Biochemical\ncomponents, such as the organic and mineral components of calcified tissue\nsamples can be identified by interpretation and analysis of the peaks present\n[28, 30, 32]; further multivariate analysis, such as Principle Component\nAnalysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) can be used to elucidate\nchanges across the spectral range [32\u201335].\n\nFor example, a higher collagen to phosphate ratio allows more elasticity of\nthe sample. L. cyclotis ivory has a complex internal structure with a\npronounced \"criss-cross\" pattern of collagen fibres, which gives the tusk\ngreater strength and durability [36], and this \u2018hardness\u2019 is preferred in the\nJapanese ivory market [37]. There is little preference in China, where the\n\u2018softer\u2019 ivory of both L. africana and E. maximus is used. Ivory from these\nspecies is more brittle and liable to crumble, possibly due to a lower\ncollagen to phosphate ivory ratio compared with L. cyclotis [37]. There are\nalso observable differences in the colour of ivory from Loxodonta species. The\nsavannah elephant has cream-coloured ivory, whereas the tusks from the forest\nelephant are described as having a pink tinge [38]. Such \u2018pink ivory\u2019 is\nhighly valued in Japan [39], where it is often used for name seals, known\nlocally as \u2018hanko\u2019 or \u2018inkan\u2019. Raman spectroscopy has previously been used to\nanalyse ivory specimens, in order to assess the biodeterioration of samples\n[40], the age of elephants [41], and to distinguish between real and fake\nivories [42]. Spatially offset Raman spectroscopy has been utilised to\nidentify ivory concealed below a coating intended to avoid detection [42]. As\nthe technique is non-destructive and does not require any sample preparation\nthere is potential for it to be applied in the identification of mammoth and\nelephant ivory at customs worldwide to aid in the enforcement of ivory trade\nbans [37, 43\u201345].\n\nIn this paper, it is hypothesised that mammoth and elephant ivory can be\ndistinguished using Raman spectroscopy because of the differences in their\nbiochemical composition. This hypothesis will be tested by measuring the\ndifferences in mineralisation and collagen composition of tusks.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Specimens\n\nSamples of mammoth and elephant tusks were kindly loaned by the Natural\nHistory Museum, London, UK (Table 2).\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT\n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG\n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF\n\noriginal image\n\nTable 2.

In total, three modern elephant samples\nand eight mammoth samples were analysed.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0299689.t002\n\nAll of the mammoth tusks (Fig 1B) were from the species Mammuthus primigenius,\nwith samples originating from either the Lyakhov Islands and near the Yenisei\nriver, Krasnoyarsk (Siberia, Russia), and are of Late Pleistocene age. The\nelephant ivory samples (Fig 1A) consisted of a cross section of an Elephas\nmaximus tusk and eight carved ivory bangles from Loxodonta spp. The samples\nhad been identified by staff at the Natural History Museum based on\ngeographical origin and gross appearance. To the best of our knowledge none of\nthe samples had been treated or coated.\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT\n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG\n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF\n\noriginal image\n\nFig 1.

A\nfull description of each sample is given in Table 1.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0299689.g001\n\n### Raman spectroscopy\n\nSpectra were acquired from each ivory sample with an inVia Raman micro\nspectrometer (Renishaw Ltd, Gloucestershire, UK) equipped with an Olympus\n50\u00d7/0.5 long working distance objective lens and a 785nm laser, 200mW at\nsource with 1200 l/mm grating. The laser power at the sample was ~10 mW. Each\nspectrum was collected for 60s (6 \u00d7 10 s accumulations) in the spectral range\n~600\u20131700 cm^-1. Independent spectra were collected at a minimum of ten\ndifferent locations, more than 10 \u03bcm apart, for each sample to provide\nreplicates and to account for any heterogeneity. Further spectra were acquired\nusing line maps from the medulla to the cortex of a tusk on one mammoth\nsample. The spectra were not collected from areas of tusks that had visible\ndebris or damage. In total, 272 spectra were obtained from 8 Mammuthus\nprimigenius samples, 203 spectra from Loxodonta spp. and 17 spectra were\nobtained from Elephas maximus.\n\n### Data analysis\n\nData was analysed with Matlab (v2021a, The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA).\nAll spectra were baseline corrected using a sixth order polynomial subtraction\nand vector normalised using a previously published script [33, 46]. Principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) was performed on this data, and up to 10 principal\ncomponents were generated for each analysis. Data were classed by species\nand/or genus for the purposes of the analysis.\n\nUnivariate analysis of the phosphate (960 cm^-1) to amide I (1660 cm^-1) peak,\nand the phosphate (960 cm^-1) to amide III (1240\u20131260 cm^-1) peak intensity\nratios were performed using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation) to compare\nthe mineral to collagen ratio of samples from elephant and mammoth tusks.\nThese peaks were chosen as significant peaks consistently present in spectra\nfrom every sample. In addition, peak intensity ratios of carbonate (1060\ncm^-1) to phosphate (960 cm^-1) were used to look at the carbonate\nsubstitution. A one-way ANOVA for each peak intensity ratio was performed\nusing GraphPad Prism (v10.0.0 for Windows, GraphPad Software, Boston,\nMassachusetts USA). The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the phosphate\npeak (960 cm^-1) was calculated using SpectraGryph (v1.2.16.1, 2023) to\ncompare crystal maturity.\n\nWhen analysing the data from the line map, the spectra were grouped in 14\nclasses (each class representing approximately 0.5 cm of travel) and PCA-\nLinear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA) was performed.\n\n## Results\n\nThe average spectra of each sample show that the biochemical composition of\nthe samples is broadly similar (Fig 2A). The quality of the spectra from the\nmammoth ivory, demonstrate that the mammoth ivory is well preserved, as there\nare prominent organic collagen peaks.\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT\n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG\n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF\n\noriginal image\n\nFig 2.

PCA scores plots (Fig 2B) reveal\ndistinct groupings of different species with some inter-sample variation.\n\nFig 2A presents the average spectra from each of the 11 samples analysed in\nthis study, categorised by species. All samples demonstrate a well-preserved\norganic component with prominent amide peaks. The PCA scores plot (Fig 2B)\ndemonstrated some separation between the species, and some within-species\nvariation; the largest distinction is between the chemistry of ivory from\nLoxodonta and Mammuthus primigenius. Fig 2C, a PCA loadings plot, suggests the\nlargest contribution to the differences are at the phosphate (960 cm^-1),\namide III (1240\u20131260 cm^-1) and amide I (1650 cm^-1) peaks.\n\nThe data demonstrates some distinction between the mammoth and elephant ivory,\nwith the corresponding PCA loadings plot showing differences in PC1 at the\nphosphate (961 cm^-1), lipid (1300 cm^-1) and left hand side of amide I (1590\ncm^-1) regions, and PC2 contains notable contributions from the phosphate (960\ncm-1), middle of the amide I peak (1665 cm^-1), amide III (1250 and 1270\ncm^-1), carbonate (1070 cm^-1) and CH2 (1250 cm^-1) peaks (Fig 3C). This means\nthat the strongest variation between all three species, identified from\ndifferences along PC1, is due to specific organic contributions and the\nwavenumber immediately to the right of the centre of the hydroxyapatite peak.\nMammuthus primigenus is further separated along PC2 due to contributions from\nthe centre of the phosphate peak, carbonate peak and several collagen peaks\n(Fig 3C).\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT\n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG\n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF\n\noriginal image\n\nFig 3.\n\n[A] PCA scores plot of the ivory samples Mammuthus primigenius [magenta] and\nliving elephants [blue] and [B] PCA plot of from each tusk sample Loxodonta\nspp. (cyan and blue) and Elephas maximus (yellow); [C] PCA Loadings plot\ncorresponding to [B].\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0299689.g003\n\nAn analysis of the ratio between the phosphate and amide1 (Fig 4A) or amide\nIII (Fig 4B) peaks provides the potential to differentiate between ivory\nbetween the species (Fig 4A\u20134C).

This study\nhas shown that differences in the average spectra between species can be\nidentified using PCA, and that univariate analysis of the phosphate to amide I\nand amide III peaks can potentially be used to distinguish between species of\nthe Elephantadiae genus, as can comparison of the carbonate to phosphate\npeaks. The higher mineral-to-collagen ratio of Elephas maximus could reflect\nthe closer evolutionary divergence to Mammuthus species than of Loxodonta\nspecies. This study has also shown that Raman spectroscopy could also be used\nto identify whether an ivory sample is from the medulla or the cortex of a\ntusk. Furthermore, the analysis has highlighted the main spectral features\nthat differ between and within species, largely related to the mineralisation\nprofile. This could be further explored with larger sample sizes, particularly\nbecause differences in mineralisation of bone between species is well\nreported, and it is hypothesised that teeth could exhibit variation based on\nstructure, function within a species, and the environment.\n\nThe inter-sample variation that was seen in the Mammuthus species could be due\nto age of the sample, age of the mammoth at time of death, differences in diet\nor climate conditions, or that it may have been subject to slightly different\ngeological conditions which can have an impact on the tusk microstructure and\ntherefore subsequent material properties, such that permafrost preserved ivory\nhas a lower hardness than fresh material [47]. There is also evidence of post-\nmortem changes in bone samples after burial, whereby trace elements are\nexchanged between the bone and the surrounding material [49]. It is likely\nthan this phenomenon also occurs in buried tusk samples.\n\nIn addition, in this study the Loxodonta spp. samples had been previously\nground and polished; this means that there was an increased number of photons\nreflected and an improved signal-to-noise ratio. Many of the mammoth samples,\nhowever, had a rough surface and had not been polished, meaning they had a\nlower signal-to-noise ratio, which could partially explain the wider variation\nin the spectra obtained from the Mammuthus primigenius samples.\n\nPreliminary work has suggested it is possible to tell the biological age of an\nindividual elephant from which a tusk has been taken by comparing the collagen\nto bioapatite peak ratios of the samples [41]. Data taken from human research\nalso suggests that Raman spectroscopy can be used in understanding the dating\nof mammalian calcified tissues [48\u201351]. However, to date, there has been\nlimited research into the dating of tusks using Raman spectroscopy [52]. The\nauthors hypothese that this could be possible to observe differences based on\ndate via Raman spectra in one of two ways: either by the collagen to mineral\ndegradation rate over time, or through the identification of proxy substances\n(a method used in dating historical art [53]) found either coating the ivory\nsuperficially, or that have been incorporated within the tusk matrix. The\ndevelopment of a non-destructive technique for dating ivory samples could aid\nin the differentiation of antique and newly created ivory artefacts and\nprovide another powerful tool for the detection of illegal ivory across the\nglobe.\n\nA significant limitation of this study is that only a small number of ivory\nsamples were analysed. This means there is a limited amount of information\nthat is captured by the analysis. The work has yet to explore differences in\nthe biochemistry between Loxodonta africana and Loxodonta cyclotis. L.\ncyclotis tusks are known to be straighter than those of L. africana, and their\nivory is described as harder and pinkish in colour [54]. During the formation\nof dentine, there are many ions that can be substituted within the crystal\nstructure, this can include anionic, such as F^\u2212, Cl^\u2212, SiO_4^4\u2212, and CO_3^2\u2212,\nor cationic substitutions such as Na^+, Mg^2+, Fe^2+, K^+, Sr^2+, Zn^2+,\nBa^2+, Al^3+ [10]. It is possible that such substitutions could be responsible\nfor the \u2018pinkish\u2019 tinge to the tusks of L. cyclotis, and that this different\nin biochemical composition could be used to separate L. africana and L.\ncyclotis spectroscopically. Future work should aim to further understand the\ndifferences in chemical structure of tusks between these extant elephants, and\ncould also benefit from genetic analysis of tusks alongside spectroscopic\nanalysis, to ensure accurate species identification.\n\nIt is possible that some of the \u2018interspecific\u2019 differences identified here,\nparticularly between the eight mammoth samples, could be partly or even\nlargely due to differences in the sex or age, or taphonomic changes to\ncollagen over time. Further research with larger sample sizes is needed to\nassess levels of variation, both within and between species, and the use of\nphotochemical bleaching prior to spectral acquisition could be used to reduce\nbackground fluorescence. However, despite the limitations imposed by sample\nsize, the major pattern in the analysis of our data appears to reflect\ninterspecific differences.\n\nThis study used PCA and PCA-LDA as multivariate analytical techniques [33],\nthough other methods, such as multiple linear regression, cluster analysis and\npartial least squares regression, are used in the analysis of Raman\nspectroscopic data sets [55]. A future comparison of these methods may prove\nuseful in ensuring correct species classification.\n\nIn conclusion, Raman spectroscopy is a promising tool for the identification\nof ivory. While this study utilised a large, laboratory-based inVia Raman\nspectrometer, a recent study has demonstrated that smaller, more portable,\nmobile Raman spectrometers could offer a similar quality of data [44].\nHandheld Raman spectrometers have been used for several years in the study of\nbone tissue [31, 56] and are regularly used in industry for the purposes of\nraw material verification and unknown substance identification [57].\n\nFurther work is needed to assess intra- and interspecific variation and to\ncompile a functional database of reference spectra that could be used for\nidentifying unknown ivory samples. An average spectral signature of each\nspecies could be added to the CITES trade database [58] or the UNDOC\nguidelines for ivory identification [59] for rapid consultation at customs\npoints around the globe. This could form a quick and easy method of\ndetermining ivory species to help combat illegal trade. Increased surveillance\nand monitoring of samples passing through customs worldwide using Raman\nspectroscopy could act as a deterrent to those poaching endangered and\ncritically endangered species of elephant.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe authors would like to thank the curators Pip Brewer, Nadine Gabriel,\nRoberto Portela-Miguez and Roula Pappa from the Natural History Museum, London\nfor the loan of the samples included in this project.\n\n## References\n\n  1. 1\\.
