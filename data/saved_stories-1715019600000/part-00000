The Swiss company\nNeustark hopes that its technology will play a part in a future carbon removal\nindustry.\n\nApr 30 2024\n\nIn the metal casings on the left, demolished concrete reacts with CO2.

(Image:\nHanno B\u00f6ck)\n\nIt is not an area of the German capital Berlin that many of its visitors will\never see: in an industrial area in Berlin's outer district Marzahn, the\nrecycling company HEIM operates a construction waste landfill.\n\nHEIM collects debris from teardowns and sells it as new building material.\nThomas Drechsler, the site's operations manager, says the company's goal is to\nre-use the material as much as possible, preferably in high-value\napplications. However, he complains that German regulation often makes a\nhigher-value use difficult.\n\nSince late 2023, the recycling facility has been using its waste in a novel\nand unexpected way: it serves as a storage material for carbon emissions. Heim\ncollaborates with the Swiss company Neustark, which has developed a technology\nthat lets carbon dioxide react with demolished concrete. It permanently\nneutralizes the greenhouse gas and prevents its release into the atmosphere.\n\n## CO2 from Biomethane plants is stored in demolished Concrete\n\nWhile Neustark collaborates with recycling companies like HEIM to store CO2,\nthey also need a source of the greenhouse gas. Currently, Neustark's preferred\nsources of CO2 are biomethane facilities.\n\nBiomethane is made from biogas, which is produced by the fermentation of\ninputs like agricultural waste or \u2014 more controversial and less climate-\nfriendly \u2014 crops like corn. It is a mixture of primarily methane and carbon\ndioxide. To produce pure biomethane from biogas, both gases need to be\nseparated. Therefore, biomethane facilities have almost pure carbon dioxide as\na by-product. Today, biomethane facilities often simply release it into the\natmosphere.\n\nNeustark's plant in Berlin-Marzahn uses CO2 from a biomethane facility near\nDresden. By using biogenic emission sources, Neustark can claim that its\ntechnology removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and generates negative\nemissions.\n\nNeustark already operates several facilities in Switzerland. The plant in\nBerlin-Marzahn is the first abroad. They want to build more, but Neustark's\nrepresentatives have a complaint that many cleantech companies in Germany will\nshare: slow approval processes.\n\n\"Compared to Switzerland, the approval took three to four times as long here\",\nsaid Neustark spokesperson Elmar Vatter when I visited their facility in\nBerlin. Neustark is currently waiting for an approval according to the German\nemission control law (BImschG) for another facility in the western part of\nGermany since almost a year.\n\nThe most visible part of Neustark's plant is a large CO2 storage tank. One to\ntwo times per week, around 20 tons of liquid CO2 are shipped via truck from\nthe biogas facility in Dresden to Neustark's plant in Berlin and pumped into\nthat storage tank. The CO2 liquefaction is one of the most energy-intensive\nsteps in the chain, but it is necessary to make CO2 transport practical.\n\nIn the plant, carbon dioxide is turned back into a gaseous state and then fed\ninto metal casings where crushed concrete is essentially bathed in the\ngreenhouse gas. This process takes between two and four hours.\n\n## What makes Cement so damaging makes Neustark's technology possible\n\nNeustark's technology lets carbon dioxide react with calcium hydroxide. In\nessence, the technology does the opposite of what makes cement production so\ndamaging to the climate. A key ingredient of cement and concrete is clinker,\nwhich is made by converting calcium carbonate (CaCO3) to calcium oxide (CaO),\na reaction that produces plenty of carbon dioxide as an unwanted by-product.\nBefore its use, cement is mixed with water. That water reacts with the calcium\noxide in the clinker, producing calcium hydroxide.\n\nThat calcium hydroxide is what makes Neustark's technology possible: By\nletting it react with CO2 and turning it back into calcium carbonate, carbon\nis permanently stored. This reaction also happens naturally in concrete with\nCO2 from the air, but only at the surface and much slower.\n\n\"The strength of this approach is that it is permanent,\" says Valentin\nGutknecht, one of Neustark's founders. \"Carbon dioxide is mineralized, most\nlikely for millions of years.\"\n\nLiquefying CO2, transporting it by truck, and other steps in the process chain\nobviously need energy, which in substantial parts still comes from fossil\nfuels today. However, according to Gutknecht, the emissions in the process\nchain are minor compared to the CO2 they remove. They achieve an efficiency of\n93 percent for their operations in Switzerland, meaning that per ton of CO2\nstored, around 70 kilograms of CO2 are emitted. In Germany, it is slightly\nworse due to higher emissions of electricity and longer transport distances,\nbut the company says they still achieve an efficiency in the range of 85 to 90\npercent.\n\nThe carbon-enriched material is used in similar ways to how it would have been\nif it hadn't been processed by Neustark's process. In Germany, most of it is\nused as filling material in road construction. Not exactly a high-value use\ncase and also not necessarily the best partner for the climate \u2014 Germany's\ntraffic sector regularly fails to achieve any emission reduction targets.\n\nA better use would be to use the material as aggregate in recycled concrete.\nIt could reduce the amount of gravel needed. In this scenario, Neustark's\ntechnology has an additional advantage: The chemical composition of the\ncarbon-enriched concrete allows reducing the amount of clinker in the\nconcrete. Thereby, it reduces the need for the material that produces so much\ncarbon dioxide in its production process.\n\nRecycled concrete is already used regularly in Switzerland, which is often\nnamed as a positive example in this area. However, in Germany, hardly any\nconcrete waste finds its way into recycled concrete due to regulatory barriers\nand a lack of supporting policies.\n\n## One of the larger players in the Carbon Removal Market\n\nNeustark's facility in Marzahn can store around 1,000 tons of carbon dioxide\nper year. All of Neustark's current plants combined have a capacity of around\n7,000 tons per year.\n\nIs that significant? Certainly not if compared to existing emission sources.\nThe city of Berlin emits around 16 million tons of carbon dioxide per year, so\nNeustark's plant hardly makes any difference. But as Valentin Gutknecht says,\nNeustark is already one of the larger players in the carbon removal market\nwith that capacity.\n\nNeustark's business model is to sell carbon removal certificates to entities\nthat want to make up for their emissions. According to the carbon removal\ninformation website CDR.fyi, the bank UBS and the software company Microsoft\nare among Neustark's largest buyers.\n\nCarbon compensation schemes and climate neutrality claims by companies based\non certificates have come under increasing criticism in recent years. It is\noften highly questionable if certificates are related to any emission\navoidance that would not have happened otherwise.\n\nCarbon removal companies like Neustark position themselves as providers of\nmore trustworthy certificates. Additionality is easier to validate, as it is\nrelatively obvious that no one would actively remove CO2 from the atmosphere\nwithout a business model. It is also highly unlikely that mineralized carbon\nwill later escape into the atmosphere \u2014 a common concern about natural carbon\nsinks.\n\nNeustark does not publicly communicate what its certificates cost and\ncurrently only targets businesses as its customers. According to CDR.fyi,\ncarbon removal credits for mineralization technologies cost around 320 US\ndollars. This is a lot more than what less trustworthy certificate providers\ncharge. Those are traded at prices between 4 and 8 US dollars. But it is still\na lot less than what the company Climeworks \u2014 also from Switzerland \u2014 charges\nto remove CO2 directly from the air via direct air capture.\n\nYet, ultimately, the voluntary carbon removal certificate market is only a\nmeans to develop technologies now that the world might need at much larger\nscales in the future.\n\nGutknecht says that by 2050, the world will need to remove around 10 billion\ntons of carbon dioxide annually. \"This will need a completely new industry of\nthe size of the current oil and gas sector,\" says Gutknecht. He estimates that\ncarbon storage in construction waste and other mineral wastes like slags and\nashes could provide around half a billion tons of this capacity.\n\nNeustark's near-term goal is more modest: the company wants to develop the\ncapacity for 100,000 tons of CO2 removal per year by 2026 \u2013 and one million\ntons by 2030.\n\nAuthor: Hanno B\u00f6ck\n\nWant to read more stories like this?
