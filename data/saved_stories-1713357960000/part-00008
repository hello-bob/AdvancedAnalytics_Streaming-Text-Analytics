They will be replaced\nwith an enterprise sales staff to target potential new clients, as well as\ndevelopers focused on business-to-business software products, Tome Co-founder\nand CEO Keith Peiris told Semafor in an exclusive interview.\n\n\u201cI think the real business is identifying those couple thousand sales and\nmarketing leaders using the product and then selling them something really\nsophisticated for their whole company,\u201d Peiris said.\n\nAD\n\nThe change highlights how the business models of the AI boom differ from the\nWeb 2.0 era, when eyeballs and advertising were the two most important metrics\nof success. Tome, whose founders come from Meta, originally envisioned the\nproduct as a tool that attracted professionals and consumers. Its 20 million\nusers, most of whom don\u2019t pay, have created \u201cTomes\u201d for a wide variety of\npurposes, from dinner party invitations, to post-surgery medical instructions,\nto startup pitch decks.\n\nBut the company noticed recently that sales organizations were willing to pay\nfor added features. With its latest focus, Tome has been rolling out new\ncapabilities specific to the sales industry, going beyond just the visual and\ninto the content of sales pitches with tasks like research and customer\npersonalization.\n\nFor instance, Tome is working on an AI tool that can scrape U.S. Securities\nand Exchange Commission filings for valuable information that could be useful\nin sales pitches to public companies. It also connects to Salesforce data and\ncan mine internal sales call transcripts with past customers.\n\nAD\n\nPeiris consulted on the change with one of the company\u2019s early backers, former\nPayPal executive and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, who advised Tome that a\nmore narrow focus, at least in the short term, could help the company generate\nrevenue while also leaving intact the possibility of broader ambitions. \u201cIt\ncould very well be that you go back to \u2018it\u2019s the decision making persuasion\ntool for everybody\u2019 at some X time down the road,\u201d Hoffman told Semafor. \u201cBut\nthis is the way you get there by being amazing for these people.\u201d\n\nHoffman said he went through something similar at LinkedIn, when the company\noriginally focused on individuals but the real customers turned out to be\ncompanies. \u201cIt increases my view of the likelihood and odds of success,\nbecause you start with something that is focused and intense, do really well\nat it, and then depending on how well you succeeded, you can broaden out from\nthat,\u201d he said.\n\nPeiris said these new features and the more bespoke nature of the business\nrequired different skill sets than those belonging to the more consumer-\nfocused product developers Tome initially hired.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI grew up with the Facebooks and Instagrams of the world, and the way that we\nbuild products there is a little bit different,\u201d Peiris said. The new focus\nwill require software that\u2019s \u201cgoing to be a lot more information-processing\noriented versus aesthetic oriented,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to be sadly\nparting ways with a talented product management team and rebuilding that from\nscratch.\u201d\n\nIn this article:\n\n### The Scoop\n\n### Know More\n\n### Reed\u2019s view\n\n### Room for Disagreement\n\n### Notable\n\n### Know More\n\nTome has been testing out its new product road map with a handful of pilot\ncustomers, including the authentication startup Stytch. Pete Prowitt, Stytch\u2019s\nhead of revenue, said he first came across Tome when a prospective employee\nused it in a mock sales exercise. \u201cAt the time, I didn\u2019t get it,\u201d Prowitt said\nin an interview.\n\nA few months into his job at Stytch, the same employee kept using Tome to make\nsales decks, which were more effective and took a fraction of the time to make\nthan the ones Prowitt spent months designing.\n\nTome recently did a presentation on the new features for Stytch\u2019s sales team.\nIt showed how from a single prompt, Tome could generate a sales deck tailored\nto specific customers, including which competitors that customer is currently\nusing. \u201cIt was like a pin drop kind of demo because it shows so well. It\u2019s so\ncool,\u201d Prowitt said.\n\n### Reed\u2019s view\n\nTome is an interesting startup to watch if you want to see a microcosm of the\nAI boom right now, or perhaps foreshadowing of what\u2019s to come.\n\nThe social media era was defined by startups that scaled to tens of millions\nof users before they even started thinking about revenue. The business models\nof companies founded around a generative AI-enabled tool are still hazy. The\nbest AI models, like Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3 Opus or OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4, are still\nrelatively expensive to run.\n\nAt least for now, most AI startups will need to find some revenue source or\nrisk cutting their runways dangerously short. My guess is that many will need\nto find some lucrative but somewhat narrow customer base that is willing to\nspend money. (In time, the infrastructure will catch up and we\u2019ll go back to\nthe days of relatively inexpensive cloud costs for hyper growth startups).\n\nThe other reason Tome is interesting is because of who\u2019s invested in it. It\nwas conceived with the help of Hoffman, who\u2019s become one of the great thinkers\non startup strategy.\n\nI asked him whether he thought people might look at Tome laying off some\nemployees as a sign that the AI boom might be about to go bust. It was only a\ncouple of weeks ago that Inflection AI, a company Hoffman helped found, was\nessentially subsumed by Microsoft. \u201cPeople want either the \u2018conquers the\nworld\u2019 or the \u2018going down in flames\u2019 story,\u201d he said. Tome is a good example\nof what is going to happen over the next year, as companies look for product-\nmarket fits.\n\n### Room for Disagreement\n\nThe Information, citing anonymous sources, reported in an article last week\nthat it was Peiris and co-founder Henri Liriani who wanted to target startup\nfounders and freelancers as customers, which faced pushback from some staff\nwho thought enterprise users were the best focus.\n\n\u201cTome, like a number of other AI startups, has struggled with internal\ndivisions over the best target market for its product, said current and former\nemployees,\u201d The Information reported. \u201cWhile some staffers believed that a\npresentation tool would be best-suited for enterprise users like salespeople\nand marketers who made presentations on a daily basis, Tome\u2019s founders\ninitially wanted to emphasize selling to individuals like startup founders and\nfreelancers.\u201d\n\n### Notable\n\n  * The tech industry was known for many years as the place of constant growth. But lately, tech companies have gotten comfortable with laying people off when it makes financial sense. Reuters reported that the tech industry is leading other sectors in layoff announcements, with 42,442 this year.\n\nAD\n\n", "frontpage": false}
