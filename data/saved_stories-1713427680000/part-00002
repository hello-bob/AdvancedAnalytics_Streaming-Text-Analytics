Previous attempts to get it to tell me about the ethical\nissues, such as PTSD in its moderators, or whether using source code was not\nOpen Source was unethical failed due to heavy moderation of such topics. In\nother words ChatGPT would not tell me anything bad about its inception or the\ncorporate practices of its creator. Here are the results of a different\nattempt, the references came to me via Mastodon.\n\nIn our digital age, if we look beneath the shiny veneer of our digital lives,\nwe find ourselves navigating a complex online landscape that shape how we\ncommunicate, work, and interact with the world. Among these, there exists\nplatforms that stand out for unparalleled utility, effectiveness, and\ntransformative impact. Unfortunately, behind the seductive facade of\ninnovation and convenience lie the normative troubling patterns of ethical\npractices that are hard to ignore. Corporate social media(CSM) reflects a\npattern that privileges capitalistic paradigms that empower authority and\nreduce choice through agglomeration and reducing privacy. Today, CSM is\nubiquitous and choosing not to engage with it is almost impossible.\n\nNow the new digital shiny is 'AI' and even the term 'AI' is both wrong and\nanthropocentric. As usual profit is found in externalising the costs of human\nand environmental suffering and 'AI' is amplifying this pattern.\n\nCorporate 'AI'(CAI), while a beacon of productivity and connectivity, is\nmarred by its involvement in exploitative employment practices, intellectual\ntheft, reliance on proprietary software and data harvesting, and has a\nshockingly large carbon cost. The CAI practices of paying low wages to\nmoderators, particularly in African countries, not only perpetuate economic\ninequality but also contribute to trauma of those most vulnerable. This is a\npattern which many view as a modern iteration of the pattern of western\ncolonialism and slavery. Additionally, its engagement in intellectual theft\nundermines the principles of fairness, innovation, and ethical competition, in\nother words something of an abuse of the sharing and gift economy that is\nembodied by the internet. Furthermore, its reliance on proprietary software\nand data harvesting raises concerns about privacy, autonomy, and consent,\nwhile its substantial carbon footprint exacerbates environmental degradation\nand climate change.\n\nYet, despite these ethical transgressions, the undeniable truth remains: 'AI'\nis one of the most useful, supportive, and effective tools ever built by\nhumans. It has revolutionized how we collaborate, communicate, and access\ninformation, empowering individuals and communities to achieve unprecedented\nlevels of learning, productivity and connectivity. Its extensive features and\nfunctionalities have streamlined workflows, facilitated global cooperation,\nand democratized access to knowledge and resources. Similarly to CSM, it has\nbecome an indispensable part of our digital lives, driving innovation,\neconomic growth, and social progress despite its deeply troubling foundations\nand implications for our future.\n\nWhen considering whether to continue using this online service, we are faced\nwith a profound tension between its undeniable benefits and its troubling\nethical implications. On one hand, using CAI risks justifying the human\nsuffering, environmental harm, and ethical compromises that underlie its\noperation. On the other hand, we cannot deny the tangible benefits it offers\nto millions of users worldwide, nor the inevitable uptake, evolutionary\nquickening and societal change that it embodies.\n\nAs humans, lets approach this dilemma with compassion, curiosity, and\ncreativity. Acknowledging the complex interplay of competing interests and\nvalues at stake, while also recognizing our capacity to effect change and\nshape the future of the digital landscape through our choices and actions.\nRather than succumbing to despair, resignation or denial, lets harness our\ncollective ingenuity and imagination to envision and create alternatives that\nprioritize ethical integrity, environmental sustainability, and social\njustice. Lets build towards a digital future worthy of our children.\n\nWe invite curiosity and creativity in both recognizing the opportunity of CAI\nand striving to create something less awful \u2013 something that better embody the\nprinciples of fairness, transparency, and respect for human dignity. Whether\nthrough advocating for ethical business practices, supporting alternative\nplatforms that prioritize ethical values, or actively participating in efforts\nto reduce our digital carbon footprint, we have the capacity to shape a future\nthat is both innovative and ethical.\n\nThe choice to continue using this online service is not simple, but rather a\nnuanced exploration of competing values and interests. By approaching this\ndilemma with compassion, curiosity, and creativity, perhaps we can better\nnavigate the complexities of the digital age whilst at the same time striving\nto create a more just, equitable, and sustainable future for all.\n\nChatGPT(3.5) prompt: \u201cplease write a deliberation about using an online\nservice that has disgusting employment practises (Paying extremely low wages\nto africans and contributing to their ill health and trauma), and has other\nethical problems with intellectual theft and is also based on proprietary\nsoftware and data harvesting and also has a very large carbon cost BUT on the\nother side is one of the most useful, supportive and effective tools ever\nbuilt by humans. invite curiousity and creativity in both having compassion\nfor using the tool whilst also prioritising creating something less awful \u201c\n\nHeavily edited the resulting response, using an NVC lens.\n\nReferences:\n\nOpenAI used outsourced Kenyan workers earning less than $2 per hour to make\nChatGPT less toxic, my investigation found:\n\nhttps://mastodon.social/@perrigo/109710236957591876\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/podcasts/the-journal/the-hidden-workforce-that-helped-\nfilter-violence-and-abuse-out-of-chatgpt/ffc2427f-bdd8-47b7-9a4b-27e7267cf413\n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-computer-scientist-breaks-down-\ngenerative-ais-hefty-carbon-footprint/\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-copyright-law/\n\nMastodon\n\n", "frontpage": false}
