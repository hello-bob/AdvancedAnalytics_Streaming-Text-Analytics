Unfortunately the wealth of meaning in the lyrics\nmay not be readily apparent to most non-desis, or for that matter, to many\ndesis either.At the risk of diminishing the enjoyment of those who do\nunderstand the somewhat esoteric message, this essay attempts to make it clear\nenough for anybody to appreciate. In the process we\u2019ll be touching on Indian\nculture in general and specifically on that great opiate of the Indian masses,\nthe movie industry.Cornershop is an East-West fusion pop-rock group. The East\npart comes from Tjinder Singh, who grew up in England but is of Punjabi\norigin. Tjinder strongly identifies with his Indian heritage; the group\u2019s name\nitself derives from a play on the stereotype of the Indian/Pakistani street-\ncorner grocery store clerk.\u201cBrimful of Asha\u201d came out in 1997. With its catchy\nrefrain it became a hit on US radio, as well as in Cornershop\u2019s native UK.To\nunderstand the song, one must understand the Indian movie industry. Ever since\ncinema was introduced to India, most commercial movies have been heavy, sweet,\nmusical productions. The song-and-dance interludes are not incidentals, but\nstaples, and often are what make or break a movie. An American friend of mine\nwas under the impression that singing was a necessary skill for Indian actors\nand actresses! Actually, the singing is almost always done by background\nsingers. The background singers, of course, are not required to possess\ncharisma or looks, and in fact in early times, care was taken to not expose\nthem in the media, to preserve the romantic association with their voices in\nthe minds of the moviegoing public.Why is all this so important? Right from\nthe beginning, movies took over the hearts and lives of common Indians in a\nmanner that nothing has done before or since. The happiness, the tragedy, the\npassionate and tender love, and the conflict are all designed to speak to the\nmelodrama-loving Indian heart. As Hindi grew more popular, Hindi movies took\nover the whole country. The heart of the Hindi film industry in Bombay,\nwhimsically nicknamed Bollywood, eventually became a force larger than the one\nit was named after. The songs are no exception, and over the last sixty years\nor so filmi music, as it is called, has become by far the most popular kind in\nIndia.Two female background singers perhaps distinguish themselves from the\nrest in sheer prolificness and popularity: Asha Bhonsle and Lata Mangeshkar.\nThe two, as it happens, are sisters, and recently there has been much focus on\ntheir professional and sibling rivalry. At any rate, their singing formed the\nemotional soundtrack of India, as it were, for many years.That, in essence, is\nwhat \u201cBrimful of Asha\u201d is all about.Here are the lyrics, with notes:There\u2019s\ndancing behind movie scenes, Behind those movie screens \u2013 saddi rani.Saddi\nrani \u2013 \u201cour queen\u201d, in Punjabi.She\u2019s the one that keeps the dream alive, From\nthe morning, past the evening, till the end of the light.Brimful of Asha on\nthe forty-five. Well, it\u2019s a brimful of Asha on the forty-five. (x2)\u2018Asha\u2019 is\na pun. It refers to Asha Bhosle, but the word also means \u201chope\u201d. What does\n\u201chope\u201d signify in this context? The movies and songs are in many ways a\nfantasy of something better than people\u2019s own lives. For instance, Indian\nyouth whose overbearing parents would never permit them to marry those they\nfall in love with may yet indulge themselves in the romances they see onscreen\nand hear about in these ballads. The \u201c45\u201d, for you of the CD player\ngeneration, is the 45 revolutions-per-minute record player.Incidentally, the\nword \u2018Asha\u2019 is normally pronounced with both \u2018a\u2019s long, as in \u2018father\u2019.\nTjinder, with his British accent, pronounces it like \u201cAsher\u201d, touchingly\nmaking the song both more and less genuine at the same time. As a result the\nrefrain often gets misheard, sometimes in quite hilarious ways.And singing\nIlluminate the main streets and the cinema aisles. We don\u2019t care about no\ngovernment warning, About the promotion of the simple life and the dams they\nare building.What is he talking about? The movies and songs are an escape:\nthey are what allow people to forget important concerns, at least for a while.\nThe reference to dams might need a bit of explanation. In India, these often\nare unnecessarily huge and costly projects that are designed that way with the\naim of being points of prestige, and besides, for lining the pockets of\npoliticians and contractors. They displace thousands of people and impact the\nenvironment in massive ways. The project currently approved on the Narmada is\none present-day example. So these are issues that people should be worried\nabout.But this escapism is not presented as being bad. The spirit of the song\nis that movie fantasy is a lovely and comfortable thing.Everybody needs a\nbosom for a pillow, everybody needs a bosom, (x3)Isn\u2019t that a beautiful line?\nBut the last one\u2019s even better:Everybody needs a bosom for a pillow, mine\u2019s on\nthe forty-five.To me, at least, that\u2019s poetry.Mohammed Rafi \u2013 forty-five. Lata\nMangeshkar \u2013 forty-five. Solid state radio \u2013 forty-five. Ferguson Mono \u2013\nforty-five. Non public \u2013 forty-five. Jacques Dutronc and the Bolan Boogies ...\nThe Heavy Hitters and the chi-chi music ... All Indian radio \u2013 forty-five. Two\nin ones \u2013 forty-five. Ovvo records \u2013 forty-five. Trojan records \u2013 forty-\nfive.These are historic icons of filmi and pop music. Rafi and Mangeshkar are\nother background singers. Solid state radio is self-explanatory. All-India\nRadio is the one, public radio station that existed all the decades before\nprivatized radio stations and FM came to India. Two-in-ones are radio-cum-\ncasette players. I confess the other references are strange to me.7-7,000\npiece orchestra set,Huge orchestras are intrinsic to filmi music. Of course\n7000 is a little hyperbolic.Everybody needs a bosom for a pillow; mine\u2019s on\nthe RPM... (fadeout)Why do I find this song so remarkable? Most people, when\ntalking of Indian culture, tend to make statements which fall in two\ncategories. The first consists of glorifications of classical Indian culture,\nphilosophy, tradition, and so forth. The second consists of lamentations about\nthe corruption, poverty, dirt, and how the whole country is going to the\ndogs.It is relatively unusual for someone to touch on the spirit of the ornery\nhard-bitten yet cheerful street-corner Indian, the one who always has to worry\nabout the expenses for next month but yet decides on an impulse to splurge on\nhot samosas. Cornershop manages to celebrate and showcase this joie de vivre,\nand to do so with skill and sensitivity, and for this, they deserve to be\ncongratulated.  \n---  \n  \nShare Facebook Twitter\n\nNext Post\n\nCornershop Biography by Professor Kenneth FitzGerald\n\n## Welcome to Cornershop\u2019s Official Website\n\nFollow Us\n\n## Buy directly from us\n\nAmple Play Records\n\nTweets by @CornershopHQ\n\n## Cornershop on Spotify\n\n## Slideshow\n\n\u00a9 Cornershop 2024 | All Rights Reserved | Privacy policy | Facebook Twitter\n\n\u2713\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\nAddToAny\n\nMore...\n\nLoading...\n\n", "frontpage": false}
