Yet vinyl records and film photography endure. Why do\npeople continue to use it?\n\nI finally locate the legendary Schneiders Buero, a shop selling analogue\nsynthesizers in Berlin's Kotti neighbourhood. Up two flights of stairs, the\nmusic machinery on offer includes brands such as Moog and Buchla, as well as\nmodern euro-racks. Each set-up contains headphones and boxes of patch cables.\nThere are no instructions and the machines, while alluring, are also somewhat\nimposing. (From Michael's fieldnotes)\n\nAs academics who rarely go a day without playing or making music, we have\nspent the past decade examining the extraordinary revival of analogue\ntechnology. From vinyl records to film cameras, all manner of apparently\nwritten-off technologies have been making a comeback, including modular\nsynthesizers \u2013 one of the earliest types of this now-ubiquitous electronic\ninstrument.\n\nIn the UK, some six million vinyl LPs were bought in 2023, an 11.7% rise on\nthe previous year's sales and the 16th straight year of increase. The vinyl\nrevival is also fuelling a resurgence of independent record shops, with UK\nhigh streets now having a third more (around 461 stores) than a decade ago.\n\nCertainly, the stereotype of vinyl listeners being older men no longer holds\nwater. Taylor Swift now accounts for one in every 15 vinyl albums sold in the\nUS \u2013 and was a reason for some of the Record Store Day queues in the UK in\n2023. Contemporary musicians such as Lana Del Ray, Tyler, The Creator, Olivia\nRodrigo and Kendrick Lamar also out-vinyl the likes of Metallica, who\nthemselves sell so much of their music on vinyl that they bought their own\nvinyl pressing plant to ensure supply.\n\nSuch has been the revival in analogue synthesizers that venerable brands\nincluding Korg and Moog have relaunched lower-priced modules aimed at novices,\nwhile also reviving older classics for the pros. This means there are now more\nanalogue options available than at any time since the 1970s, the heyday of the\nmodular format.\n\nSynthesizer-based music events by new brands such as Teenage Engineering are\npacked with young and middle-aged enthusiasts eager to play with Kraftwerk-\ninspired pocket calculator synths that can produce a surprising array of\nsounds.\n\nGetty Images\n\nSome musicians still want the warmer sound of analogue electronic instruments\nrather than sounds created by a computer (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nMy [Michael's Berlin] visit was one of many experiences that sought to explain\nwhy so many consumers choose these so-called \"difficult\" technologies, when\nfar simpler and more convenient options exist. Is the difficulty of learning\nto use these old devices actually the point?\n\nI tentatively connect two modules. Nothing. I suddenly realise I've been at\nthis for two hours. Feeling somewhat dazed, I look around the shop. Many of\nthose who began using the machines at the same time as me are still locked in\nthought, their machines covered in patch cords. I keep going, and eventually\nsounds start to emerge. (From Michael's fieldnotes)\n\n## The appeal of the slow\n\nWhen Phil Oakey, frontman of 80s synth-pop pioneers The Human League,\nmentioned in a 2011 interview that a new \"analogue moment\" was happening, we\nwondered whether this increased interest in obsolete formats would be a\npassing fad, or something more enduring.\n\nRegardless, we dived in anyway. Michael bought a USSR-produced Lomo LC-A\ncamera (introduced in 1984 and still manufactured today in China), a vinyl\nrecord player with plastic needles that destroyed a few records, and some\nsmall synth modules by Korg that are targeted at interested amateurs rather\nthan professional musicians.\n\nEventually, these forays became our formal research project, which has\nincluded visiting record fairs and conventions around the world, going on\nphotowalks and attending listening evenings, and meeting an array of diehard\nanalogue communities both on and off line.\n\nRather than nostalgia, they are turning to film because of its aesthetic\nvalues and a greater sense of creative control over their photos\n\nIn 2018, Giana co-wrote an article for the Harvard Business Review titled The\nGrowing Business of Helping Customers Slow Down, highlighting the growing\nappetite for \"consumer deceleration\" \u2013 and associated concepts such as \"slow\nshopping\" and the provision of \"quiet rooms\" in some high-street stores.\n\nWe see the facilitation of deceleration as beneficial for individual\nwellbeing, the environment, and businesses alike. And we expect interest in\nsuch experiences to rise exponentially in coming years. Recognising our\nexistential need to occasionally slow down can be the basis for winning\nconsumer strategies. (Gianna)\n\nGianna's article predicted a future that more of us are now acknowledging. In\nDecember 2023, the Observer newspaper called vinyl albums \u2013 together with a\nslowly brewed, \"drip\" filter coffee \u2013 the \"antidote to a frenetic digital\nworld\". This point was echoed by many of the people we have interviewed about\n\"the appeal of the slow\", including Naomi*, who had recently begun\nexperimenting with a 19th-Century-style camera.\n\n\"I like the pace of it, it really slows you down. Your options to take\npictures are really limited \u2013 you've only got two-to-six shots, and the film\nand processing are expensive. It's also very labour-intensive getting that\nshot from inside the camera to print, so you're really conscious of getting it\nright. If you make a mistake at the beginning, you can invest a few days and\nit's still going to be a rubbish shot. You're not going to fire off 1,000\npictures like digital, and that really appeals to me.\"\n\n## Saved from demolition\n\nAccording to a 2018 global photography survey, by film producer Ilford Photo,\njust under a quarter of people shooting on film \u2013 including many under the age\nof 40 \u2013 had never used this medium before. Rather than nostalgia, they are\nturning to film because of its aesthetic values and a greater sense of\ncreative control over their photos. Globally, while the film camera market is\nstill very niche, it's growing fast.\n\nGetty Images\n\nRecord Store Day features special limited-edition releases that can only be\nbought physically in record stores (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nIn response, brands including Kodak, Polaroid and Leica have re-emerged \u2013 in\nsome cases, almost from the dead. Legendary instant camera maker Polaroid was\nrescued by the Austrian entrepreneur Florian Kaps, whose Impossible Project\norganisation purchased the company's last factory in the Netherlands days\nbefore it was due to close. Kaps explained to us:\n\n\"We had just built and discovered an exponentially growing customer group of\nnew-generation instant photographers, so we had to fight for this very last\nchance to keep this medium alive! We literally saved it from demolition at the\nvery last second in 2008.\"\n\nFrom its base in downtown Vienna, the Impossible Project now offers consumers\nand commercial clients everything from large-scale Polaroid portraits to local\nhandcrafted wines, and even lessons in sourdough breadmaking and block-based\nprintmaking. Elsewhere, interest in analogue has been sustained across a range\nof categories, from the growth of board games to letter writing and the\nresilience of physical books.\n\nMembers of the US Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Scientists are also\nanalogue fans, judging by the best cinematography nominees in the 2024 Oscars.\nWhile movies shot on film remain a small proportion of film releases overall,\nfour out of the five cinematography nominees were shot on Kodak movie film\nstock (Oppenheimer, Killers of the Flower Moon, Poor Things, and Maestro).\n\nWork, effort, meaning \u2013 these ideas are all interconnected for users and\nconsumers of analogue technology\n\nAlthough digital filmmaking has some clear advantages over analogue,\nespecially when it comes to post-production and distribution, the most common\nmistake is to suggest it's more cost-effective. In 2018, Kodak's then-global\nmarketing director, Steven Overman, discussed this with us in relation to\nOppenheimer's director, Christopher Nolan, who is a well-known champion of\nshooting on film.\n\n\"One of the big myths of film is that it's more expensive than digital \u2013 but\nthat's not really true if you're a disciplined filmmaker. When a filmmaker's\nshooting ratios are off the charts, a lot of post-production needs to be done.\nBut a film like Dunkirk actually did not shoot that high a volume of film,\nbecause Chris Nolan is such a disciplined filmmaker \u2013 he knows exactly what he\nwants to capture in the shot. Shooting film by definition requires more\ndiscipline.\"\n\nOverman also noted that in sectors such as fashion, commercial photographers\nusing film are earning more than those who use digital, largely because they\nare able to stand out in a market saturated with technically great work. He\nsaid luxury brands such as Gucci are particularly keen on using film\nphotography as this gives their promotional material a different look.\n\n## Work, effort, meaning\n\nMany of the photowalks Michael has been on end in a pub with arguments over\nthe relative merits of digital and film. After one such walk, James, a former\nteacher of photography, commented on a film photograph of a fox visiting a\nbackyard late at night to feed on nuts. When it was conceded that digital\nprobably was better for wildlife photography, James cut in:\n\n\"That's to miss the point! Quality-wise, there's no doubt \u2013 but you'd miss all\nthe preparation. It's like going to watch a band versus listening to a CD at\nhome. The sound might be better but you miss seeing the work that went into\nthe performance, the effort of the players and their crew.\"\n\nWork, effort, meaning \u2013 these ideas are all interconnected for users and\nconsumers of analogue technology. Whereas work is often seen as a means to an\nend, from earning a living to exercising, \"analoguers\" get a buzz out of the\nprocesses of setting things up, getting things right, trial and error, and\nbuilding up skills.\n\nAlamy\n\nThe Soviet-era LOMO LC-A camera helped create an entire movement of\nexperimental photography in the 1990s \u2013 Lomography \u2013 which endures today\n(Credit: Alamy)\n\nThis \"love of the process\" was backed up by another photographer, Dan, during\na Zoom discussion held amid one of the Covid lockdowns:\n\n\"When I'm serious, I don't want to get distracted by what [image] I'm going to\nend up with. Even with instant photography, I know I'm going to see the shot\nsoon \u2013 just not now. I love everything up until pressing the shutter. I love\nsearching for the frame, I like the output, but the whole process is\nimportant.\"\n\nYet none of the people we've interviewed are analogue purists. These vinyl\nlovers mostly also have Spotify lists; film photographers will sometimes take\nout their phone to capture material quickly; and modular synth fans often have\ntablets full of apps to replicate sounds on the go.\n\nHowever, when asked to compare the two, they talk about the greater weight and\nmeaning they give to their analogue experiences. Vinyl listeners often tell us\nthey feel more engaged with the music and have developed a deeper experience\nwith the artist. Paul, for instance, described his relationship with one\nbeloved vinyl record:\n\n\"The one [vinyl track] that will always make me cry is Aretha Franklin's A\nNatural Woman. It's scratched to hell but there's something about the warmth\nthat comes from it, which enables something that's not present \u2013 something\nadded. I think it is the quality of the human voice; it does feel more like\nsomeone's speaking to me.\"\n\nFor Paul, the particular audio quality of a vinyl recording \u2013 and even the\ndamage from having played this record so many times \u2013 is all part of his\nrelationship with this song. And part of what makes this possible is the\nprocess of analogue recording, in which all the sounds being made, including\nthe unscripted noise of the recording process itself, are captured in the\nfinal track.\n\nTo facilitate this sound, some musicians have even started setting up their\nown pressing plants, such as Jack White's Third Man Pressing in Detroit. For\nthere is another side to the analogue revival that is anything but planned.\n\n## The joy of happy accidents\n\nWhether making music, film or visual arts, \"happy accidents\" facilitated by\nrestrictive analogue technology can lead to creative inspirations. The term is\nwidely used in electronic pop music to refer to unexpected or unplanned\noutcomes that arise from the imperfections in analogue equipment, as John, a\nMelbourne-based musician and 80s music aficionado, explains:\n\n\"Half of what you do trying to make music is like a happy accident that ends\nup sounding better than what you intended. If the machine doesn't do exactly\nwhat you thought it was going to do, or goes a bit out of tune, it is all part\nof the process. Your mistakes or accidents become part of what you are trying\nto do, rather than you thinking: \u2018Oh, I will erase that and do it again\nproperly.' You get a little bit of randomness in it, and that randomness can\nadd to what you are trying to achieve.\"\n\nOr as Rusty Egan, former member of early synth-pop band Visage and co-founder\nof the ground-breaking New Romantic club Blitz in London's Covent Garden, puts\nit: \"Don't give up the possibility of accidents!\" Egan, always renowned for\nhis forthright opinions, once made that memorable plea when he took to the\nstage for a DJ set in 2011. Later that evening, he explained what he meant:\n\n\"The DJs that just finished, they're great \u2013 but they use Ableton [computer\nsoftware] to smooth out the transitions between songs. This makes it all\nperfect \u2013 too perfect. There's no possibility of mistakes. When we started, we\ndidn't have that technology, so we made mistakes and some of them were happy\naccidents, resulting in iconic tracks. Remember the slightly out of tune 'duh\nduh' on Tainted Love? Dave Ball was just learning to play and loved the sound.\nHe put Marc Almond's great voice over it, and you have perfection.\"\n\nThe revival of film-based photography is partly driven by the same\nsensibility. The Vienna-based Lomography organisation \u2013 established in 1992 by\na group of students as an arts movement to promote the taking of spontaneous\nand experimental photos \u2013 espouses such things as the \"joy of light leaks\"\ntypical of cheap Chinese and Soviet-made plastic cameras, generating all sorts\nof interesting creative outcomes.\n\nAlamy\n\nFilm cameras can be slower and morefrustrating to use for those raised on\ndigital tech, but devotees argue the results are more rewarding (Credit:\nAlamy)\n\nIndeed, rule number nine of Lomography's 10 golden rules highlights the\naccidental nature of shooting on film rather than a digital camera \u2013 and even\nthe lovely surprise of getting your developed film delivered back from the\nprocessing laboratory:\n\nSo you get a roll of film back from the lab. Who is that person? What's that\nswirl of light flickering across the image? How did the colours turn out like\nthat? Or what about that accidental double exposure \u2013 how the hell did that\nhappen? What was I even trying to shoot there? It's these happy accidents that\nwe love. (Michael)\n\nThe grainy nature of film, the crackling sound of vinyl, and the propensity\nfor analogue synths to go out of tune or suffer from power surges can all be\nkey elements in the cultural resonance of art and music. So too human\nimperfections, which seem to be more common among analogue recordings.\n\nIs digital technology de-skilling consumers, leading to a sense of alienation?\n\nFor example, the opening bass part of Cannonball, the 1993 song by US Indie\nband The Breeders, accidentally starts in a different key. Bass player\nJosephine Wiggs began playing the riff one step down, then fixed it when the\ndrums came in. And in Roxanne, the Police's 1978 single, the song begins with\nan accidental piano chord followed by lead singer Sting's laughter, prompted\nby him having accidentally sat on the piano keys.\n\nSimilarly, many of Mick Rock's legendary music photographs, such as the cover\nof Lou Reed's album Transformer, are technically very grainy because he was\nshooting in low light and \"pushing\" the film to its limits, but as a result,\nthey have a painterly feel that has enhanced their appeal and power.\n\n## Digital technology is de-skilling us\n\nOver the decade or so of our research, explanations for the analogue revival\nhave shifted from nostalgia to the desire for something physical in a digital\nage, to the sense that analogue technology is creatively preferable. The idea\nthat working within limits, and needing to overcome them, is beneficial to art\ncreation is now accepted by many within the creative sectors.\n\nIs digital technology de-skilling consumers, leading to a sense of alienation?\nAnd is this overcome by using more difficult analogue devices? This is the\nconclusion we have come to. Certain types of \"serious leisure\", including\nsports and creative activities, provide us with intrinsic joy even if they are\nfrustrating to engage in until skills are developed. Using analogue technology\nis another way consumers can feed this desire to re-skill.\n\nGetty Images\n\nVinyl records now sell more copies in the US than CDs \u2013the medium which was\nsupposed to replace it in the 1980s (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nIn a sense, while analogue users feel they have greater control over their\ncreativity, this occurs through surrendering to the demands of one's device \u2013\nalong the lines of German electronic legends Kraftwerk's menschmaschine (Man-\nMachine) philosophy. This runs contrary to the promise of most consumer-driven\ninnovation: functional superiority and increased ease of use.\n\nIn Malcolm Gladwell's best-selling debut book The Tipping Point, consumers who\nembrace new technology are seen as the innovators while the slowest to adopt\nare the laggards, often because of a lack of means to afford the latest\ninnovation. But the analogue, \"anti-tech\" revival can also be seen as a new\nform of status consumption, given the costs associated with use, repair,\nchance of failure, time to learn, and the physical space necessary for\nstorage.\n\nThe analogue revival is driven by people wanting to be active rather than\npassive consumers. The more they engage in the work required by analogue\ntechnologies, the more control they gain in shaping their desired experiences\n\u2013 first by learning the rules, then in their skilled application, and then,\nultimately, in breaking the rules, generating happy accidents to be shared\nwith like-minded others.\n\nConnecting digital and analogue technology is also common \u2013 combining two\ncompletely different systems to generate even more possibilities\n\nRob is the founder of a website originally devoted to The Human League, which\neventually became a platform for electronic music and, for a brief time, a\nrecord label. Having been dormant for a long period, suddenly the website\nbegan celebrating vinyl in a big way. Rob told us how his love of music had\nturned sour with the \"sheer ease\" of digital, starting with CDs and the MP3\nplayer \u2013 and how vinyl had reinvigorated him.\n\n\"I would never listen to the album all the way through on an MP3, so it all\nbecame a bit disjointed. It was too easy \u2013 I was getting bored. I wasn't\ngetting pulled into music as much as what I remembered ... With vinyl, it's\nmade me look at bands I never would have considered on CD at all.\"\n\nFor Rob, the problem came when listening on digital devices which didn't have\nthe \"sides\" of vinyl albums, and then listening on music streaming platforms\nwhich have digital algorithms to preference popular tracks. Much of the joy of\nlistening to music lay in discovering unsung album track gems and single\nB-sides.\n\n## 'This song sucks'\n\nIn our research, we distinguish between analogue \"craftspeople\", who have\nspent hours mastering the rules of their technology, and \"designers\" who go\nfurther. These are the people who want to stretch and break the rules and\ntrigger the happy accidents that create something altogether new. For example,\nphotographers who seek more creative expressions by pre-soaking or \"souping\"\ntheir camera film in lemon juice, coffee, beer, or even burning it.\n\nAnd among this group, connecting digital and analogue technology is also\ncommon \u2013 combining two completely different systems to generate even more\npossibilities.\n\nNiko Tavernise/Warner Bros\n\nDune2's director Denis Villeneuve used film and digital to shoot the movie to\ncreate an individualistic look (Credit: Niko Tavernise/Warner Bros)\n\nFilm director Denis Villeneuve's first instalment of Dune (2021) was initially\nshot on digital, then transferred to film, before being re-digitised. Why?\n\nVilleneuve says he felt that digital-only would have been \"too harsh\" for a\nmovie in which texture and nature play an important role. But at the same\ntime, for a story set in the year 10191, relying solely on film would have\ngiven too much of a nostalgic feel. By combining the two, Villeneuve got a\nfilm that, in his words, has a \"more timeless, painterly feel\". He pushed this\nidea even further for Dune: Part Two (2024), with many of the scenes being\nshot using vintage Soviet-era Helios-44 lenses to create the dreamlike \"bokeh\"\neffect.\n\nIn I Dream of Wires, a 2014 documentary about the return of analogue\nsynthesizers, Chris Carter, a former member of the industrial music pioneers\nThrobbing Gristle, explains the attraction of mashing up analogue and digital\ntechnology:\n\n\"I'm happy to combine analogue and digital [synth] modules. You can have\nmodules that sample and manipulate those sounds, filters that do crazy things,\nand combining all those things together you get sounds you couldn't imagine\nbefore. You can use all these mixtures of manufacturers and designs and the\nslightest thing that you do on one can have the greatest effect on something\nelse further along in that chain.\"\n\nIn 2022, legendary producer T Bone Burnett and Bob Dylan revealed they had\nbeen recording songs using a new kind of analogue, aluminium disc that,\naccording to their announcement, \"possesses a depth, resonance and sonic\nfidelity that exceeds that of vinyl, CD, streaming or any other means of\nexperiencing recorded music\". While this project was very much geared towards\nrich collectors, with the re-recording of Dylan's hit single Blowin' in the\nWind subsequently selling for $1.85m (\u00a31.48m) at auction, it suggests analogue\nmusic technology may yet have more innovations in store for us.\n\nThere is, however, another reason for the growing popularity of this old and\ndifficult technology. Recently, there has been much hand-wringing about the\nrole of humans in the creation and consumption of art forms, especially with\nthe widespread availability of AI-generated art and music.\n\nNick Cave, when sent the lyrics of a song generated by Open AI's chatbot\nChatGPT \"in the style of Nick Cave\", wrote back in January 2023: \"This song\nsucks.\" And he said a lot more besides, including that songs arise out of\nsuffering and \"data can't suffer\":\n\n\"ChatGPT has no inner being, it has been nowhere, it has endured nothing, it\nhas not had the audacity to reach beyond its limitations, and hence it doesn't\nhave the capacity for a shared transcendent experience, as it has no\nlimitations from which to transcend.\"\n\nCave, like many of our interviewees, highlights the importance of having\nlimits to overcome as part of any human creative process. Because analogue\nprivileges real people in the making of art, it may become ever more\nculturally important as an antidote to the burgeoning use of AI. Or as Cave\nputs it:\n\n\"This is what we humble humans can offer that AI can only mimic \u2013 the\ntranscendent journey of the artist who forever grapples with his or her own\nshortcomings.\"\n\n\\--\n\n*Some names in this article have been changed to protect the anonymity of the interviewees.\n\n*Michael Beverland is professor of brand management at the University of Susses Business School\n\n*Giana M Eckhardt is professor of marketing at King's College London\n\nThis article originally appearedon The Conversation, and is republished under\na Creative Commons licence.\n\n\\--\n\nFor timely, trusted tech news from global correspondents to your inbox, sign\nup to the Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a\nhandpicked selection of features and insights.\n\nTechnology\n\nPsychology\n\nDesign\n\nFeatures\n\nRelated\n\n## Are India's TikTok ghosts the app's US future?\n\n1 day ago\n\nFuture\n\n## Daniel Dennett: 'Civilisation is fragile'\n\n6 days ago\n\nFuture\n\n## Why Musk's Neuralink 'extends the mind's borders'\n\n17 Apr 2024\n\nFuture\n\nMore\n\n2 hrs ago\n\n## An insider's guide to the best sushi in Tokyo\n\nSushi book author, reviewer and guide Yukari Sakamoto shares her picks of the\nfive best sushi restaurants in the Japanese capital.\n\n2 hrs ago\n\nTravel\n\n1 day ago\n\n## A three-day paddle on the UK's newest canoe trail\n\nThe first official canoe trail in the south of Scotland just launched,\ncovering a 30-mile stretch of the majestic River Tweed.\n\n1 day ago\n\nTravel\n\n1 day ago\n\n## 12 of the most inspiring off-grid hideaways\n\nA new book features unique sanctuaries in some of North America\u2019s most\nbeautiful natural landscapes, including mountain-top cabins, treehouse forest\nhomes and desert retreats.\n\n1 day ago\n\nCulture\n\n2 days ago\n\n## How I tempted a frog to live in our garden\n\nWhen the BBC's Katherine Latham made a pond with just a plant pot, some rocks\nand a few native pond plants, she was amazed at the speed wildlife moved in.\n\n2 days ago\n\nFuture\n\n2 days ago\n\n## The new brews from Roman Britain and beyond\n\nBeer archaeologists are peering back millennia to recreate brews from ancient\nEgypt, Greece and Rome using ancient methods and ingredients.\n\n2 days ago\n\nTravel\n\n## Let us know you agree to cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best online experience.\n\nPlease let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.\n\n  * No, take me to settings\n\n", "frontpage": false}
