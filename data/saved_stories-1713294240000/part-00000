Credit:\nNature Energy (2024). DOI: 10.1038/s41560-024-01484-z\n\nBipolar membranes are a class of ion-conductive polymers comprised of two\noppositely charged layers, known as the cation-exchange and anion-exchange\nlayer. These membranes are central to the functioning of various technologies,\nincluding electrolyzers and hydrogen fuel cells.\n\nWhile many companies and start-ups are using bipolar membranes to develop new\nenergy technologies, their underlying working principles and ion solvation\nkinetics have not yet been fully elucidated. Better understanding these\nprinciples could inform the future fabrication of these materials and\nfacilitate their successful integration in various devices.\n\nResearchers at Fritz-Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society recently\ncarried out a study to examine the water dissociation and ion solvaton\nkinetics at the interface between the two layers in bipolar membranes. Their\npaper, published in Nature Energy, gathered valuable new insight that could\nguide the future design of these membranes and of promising electrocatalysts\nfor fuel cells.\n\n\"We wanted to understand the fundamental working principles of bipolar\nmembranes and how they connect to electrochemistry more broadly,\" Sebastian\nOener, corresponding author of the study, told Tech Xplore. \"Bipolar membranes\nexist for over 65 years, but previous explanations about their working\nprinciples were rather unsatisfactory. We wanted to change that, connecting\ntwo fields that were previously thought to be separate.\"\n\nBipolar membranes consist of a polymeric anion exchange layer (blue) and\ncation exchange layer (orange) sandwiched together. Build-up of space charge\ncapacitance inside polymer layers can lead to non-equilibrium electric fields\nacross a metal oxide nanoparticle catalyst bed that is placed in the junction\nbetween the membranes. These fields, together with the specific acid-base\nchemistry, determine the water dissociation and ion solvation kinetics of the\nsystem. When used inside an electrolyzer, e.g., the oxygen evolution reaction\n(OER) can be operated at locally alkaline pH and the hydrogen evolution\nreaction (HER) at a locally acidic pH. Tuning the local pH on the\nelectrocatalyst surface can be used to employ earth-abundant materials,\nimprove catalyst kinetics and stability, and even selectivity in CO2RR\nelectrolyzers and other systems. Credit: Rodellar et al.\n\nTo conduct their study, Carlos Gomez Rodellar, first author and Ph.D. student\nin the Interface Science Department, had to tackle various research challenges\nin an experimental setting. Firstly, he had to setup and benchmark a system\nthat would allow him to study the kinetics of bipolar membranes without\nundesirable interferences from the cross-over of electrolyte ions.\n\n\"This system had to apply continuously physical pressure on the membrane\nelectrode assembly with the metal oxide catalysts inside the bipolar\njunction,\" Oener explained. \"Finally, Carlos had to design the whole system in\nsuch a way that we could controllably change the temperature of the cell and\nthe humidified gases to do Arrhenius analysis and extract the bias dependent\nactivation entropy and enthalpy. All of this can be provided with a modified\nfuel cell test station.\"\n\nThe measurements collected by the researchers paint a comprehensive picture of\nthe fundamental principles underpinning the functioning of bipolar membranes.\nSpecifically, they unveiled bias-dependent relationships between the\nactivation entropy and enthalpy inside the bipolar junction, which appears to\nbe related to a bias dependent dispersion of interfacial capacitance.\n\nThe team also observed that solvation kinetics in bipolar membranes exhibit\ncharacteristics that are unrelated to the chemical composition of the\ncatalysts employed, but are likely originating from entropic changes in the\ninterfacial electrolyte. Collectively, these insights could help to develop\nbetter performing bipolar membranes for electrodialysis, CO_2 electrolyzers\nand H_2 fuel cells.\n\nWater dissociation and ion solvation for varying degrees of capacitive\ncoupling.

DOI: 10.1038/s41560-024-01484-z\n\n\"There are many different applications of bipolar membranes that are being\nexplored around the world, including at promising start-ups,\" Oener said.\n\"There is really a lot of potential. Beyond bipolar membranes, we were also\nable to show that the same physics are at play when water is dissociated and\nhydroxide ions solvated at electrocatalyst interfaces.\"\n\nThe results gathered by the research group at the Interface Science Department\nof the Fritz Haber Institute demonstrate the importance of entropic changes on\nthe solvent side at liquid-solid interfaces. Their work could thus also guide\nthe design of new promising electrocatalysts to initiate specific chemical\nreactions, such as those required to generate green hydrogen from alkaline\nelectrolytes.\n\n\"Regarding bipolar membranes, there are still open fundamental questions that\nwe want to address,\" Oener added.\n\n\"For example, the water formation reaction is important when bipolar membranes\nare run in forward direction. We also explore several applications in\ncollaboration with others. These include different types of fuel cells and\nelectrodialysis type systems. When it comes to ion solvation in\nelectrocatalysis, we have multiple projects that are either already in review\nor are getting close to be submitted. Stay tuned for more.\"\n\nMore information: Carlos G. Rodellar et al, Ion solvation kinetics in bipolar\nmembranes and at electrolyte\u2013metal interfaces, Nature Energy (2024).
