He\nis the mascot^[3]^[4]^[5] and colonel-in-chief of the Norwegian King's Guard.\nThe name 'Nils Olav' and associated ranks have been passed down through three\nking penguins since 1972, the current holder being Nils Olav III.^[2]^[6]\n\n## History[edit]\n\nThe family of Norwegian shipping magnate Christian Salvesen gave a king\npenguin to Edinburgh Zoo when the zoo opened in 1913.^[3]\n\nWhen the Norwegian King's Guard visited the Edinburgh Military Tattoo of 1961\nfor a drill display,^[7] a lieutenant named Nils Egelien became interested in\nthe zoo's penguin colony. When the King's Guard returned to Edinburgh in 1972,\nEgelien arranged for the regiment to adopt a penguin. This penguin was named\nNils Olav in honour of Nils Egelien, commander of the drill platoon, and Olav\nSiggerud, contingent commander of HMKG in 1972.^[8]\n\nSir Nils inspects troops of the King's Guard, of which he is colonel-in-chief,\nfollowing his knighthood ceremony in 2008. Military insignia is attached to\nhis right flipper.The bronze statue of Nils Olav\n\nNils Olav was initially given the rank of visekorporal (lance corporal) in the\nregiment. He has been promoted each time the King's Guard has returned to the\nzoo. He was made a corporal in 1982, then promoted to sergeant in 1987.^[3]\nNils Olav I died shortly after his promotion to sergeant in 1987, and his\nplace was taken by Nils Olav II, a two-year-old near-double. He was promoted\nin 1993 to the rank of regimental sergeant major and in 2001 promoted to\n'honourable regimental sergeant major'.^[3] On 18 August 2005, he was\nappointed as colonel-in-chief of the same regiment.^[3]^[9] During the 2005\nvisit, a 4-foot-high (1.2 m) bronze statue of Nils Olav was presented to\nEdinburgh Zoo.^[3] The statue's inscription includes references to both the\nKing's Guard and to the Military Tattoo. A statue also stands at the King's\nGuard compound at Huseby, Oslo.\n\nThe next honour was a knighthood, awarded during a visit by soldiers from the\nNorwegian King's Guard on 15 August 2008.^[10] The knighthood was approved by\nKing Harald V and Nils was the first penguin to receive such an honour in the\nNorwegian Army.^[11] During the ceremony a crowd of several hundred people\nwatched the 130 guardsmen on parade at the zoo, and a citation from the King\nwas read out, which described Nils as a penguin \"in every way qualified to\nreceive the honour and dignity of knighthood\".^[12]\n\nA third penguin, Nils Olav III, took over at some point between 2008 and\n2016.^[2] On 22 August 2016 he was promoted to brigadier in a ceremony\nattended by over 50 members of the King's Guard.^[2]^[3]^[13]^[14] On 21\nAugust 2023 he was promoted to major general.^[15] Nils Olav is recognised by\nGuinness World Records as the highest-ranking penguin.^[16]\n\nNils Olav outranked the human Nils Egelien from 2005 onwards;^[3] Egelien died\non 11 December 2020, aged 87.^[17]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * William Windsor (goat)\n  * Wojtek (bear)\n  * Foo Foo (dog)\n  * List of individual birds\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Eikli, Erling. \"Generalmajor Nils Olav III: Ikke oppkalt etter kong Olav\" (in Norwegian).
