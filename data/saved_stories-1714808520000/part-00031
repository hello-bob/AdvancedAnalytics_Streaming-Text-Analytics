All the major US markets rose\non the news.\n\nLast month, the labor department reported the US added a revised 315,000 jobs\nin March, far higher than the 192,000 jobs economists had forecast. April\u2019s\nfigure was lower than forecast and the unemployment rate ticked up from 3.8%\nto 3.9% over the month but the figures underlined the continuing strength of\nthe jobs market.\n\nIt was the 40th straight month of job gains in the US and the 27th consecutive\nmonth with the unemployment rate below 4% \u2013 the longest such streak since\n1953.\n\nGains were broad-based, with healthcare, social assistance, transportation and\nwarehousing, manufacturing and construction all adding jobs.\n\nThe growth in the jobs market has continued even as the Fed has maintained its\nrates policy. The Fed said this week that inflation remained high and that it\ndid not plan to cut interest rates until it has \u201cgreater confidence\u201d that\nprice increases are slowing to the goal of 2%. Jerome Powell, the Fed chair,\nsaid the slowdown in price increases was taking longer than expected, but that\nhe expected inflation to \u201cmove back down\u201d this year.\n\nWage gains in April \u2013 which are also closely watched by the Fed \u2013 were also\nlower than forecast, increasing 3.9% from a year earlier after rising 4.1% in\nMarch.\n\n\u201cDespite missing expectations, signaling an economic cooldown, the labor\nmarket has still maintained a pattern of growth and consumers can be\ncautiously optimistic that the Fed will be able to successfully lower\ninflation while also avoiding a recession,\u201d said Steve Rick, chief economist\nat TruStage.\n\nADP, the US\u2019s largest payroll supplier, reported this week that private sector\nemployment was up 192,000 jobs in the month of April and that annual pay was\nup 5% year-over-year.\n\n\u201cHiring was broad-based in April,\u201d said Nela Richardson, chief economist at\nADP. \u201cOnly the information sector \u2013 telecommunications, media, and information\ntechnology \u2013 showed weakness, posting job losses and the smallest pace of pay\ngains since August 2021.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * US economy\n  * US unemployment and employment statistics\n  * Unemployment and employment statistics\n  * Economics\n  * Federal Reserve\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Business\n  * Economics\n  * Banking\n  * Money\n  * Markets\n  * Project Syndicate\n  * B2B\n  * Retail\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
