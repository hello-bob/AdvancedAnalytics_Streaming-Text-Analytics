They\nfind purpose in having clear goals, towards a mission they\u2019re aligned with,\nand trusted to deliver. They thrive when they\u2019re empowered, have autonomy, and\nare fairly recognized for their impact.\n\nTo harness these qualities, we need an organizational operating system built\non a solid foundation - which brings us to the Pillars of Ownership.\n\n## \u2699\ufe0f Pillars of Ownership\n\n  * Mutual Trust: is essential for leaders to delegate, and employees to express ideas and take risks\n\n    * Aligned Values: agreeing on an ethical framework for things to get done can improve cooperation and build trust\n    * Clear Rules of the Game (fair, consistent, transparent):\n\n      * Once values are aligned, consistent and transparent rules create predictability and fairness\n      * How decisions are made, disputes resolved, rewards shared, accountability doled out, all need to be clearly laid out.\n  * Alignment with the Mission: keeps everyone focused on the overarching purpose of the org and supports local decision-making\n  * Clear Goals: give teams autonomy, bring accountability, and enhance mutual trust by making sure everyone agrees on what constitutes a win\n  * Empowered Staff: empowering people to make decisions and take action on their own not only boosts engagement and satisfaction but also drives better management. When forced to delegate to their teams and take on the risk of their failure, managers have to learn to trust not only their teams, but also their own systems and guardrails to make local decisions that are globally aligned and minimize risk.\n\nSpoiler: The most important pillar is mutual trust, and that\u2019s where managers\nusually drop the ball.\n\n## \ud83e\udd1d Trust Fuels Ownership\n\n  * Trust fuels ownership.\n  * Ownership brings pride, craftsmanship, mastery, and long term thinking.\n  * Ownership drives resourcefulness, creativity, collaboration, and ultimately execution!\n  * Execution brings wins!\n  * Wins boost morale, branding, recruiting, runway, ...\n  * Trust is the ultimate accelerator.\n  * Having a high-trust org is a tremendous competitive advantage.\n\n### \ud83e\udd76 How do managers undermine trust?\n\nUnfortunately, when it comes to optimizing performance, some autocratic\nmanagers see their job solely as imposing changes and expectations on their\nteams, while never reflecting on their own contribution to the problems.\n\nBy holding themselves outside the scope of examination, let alone\naccountability, they end up creating two systems, two classes, two teams. It\u2019s\nno surprise when some managers talk about ownership, they frame it as people\ntaking ownership, rather than coming to the table motivated and somehow\nleaving disillusioned.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Fostering an ownership culture starts with building mutual trust, and as a\nleader, you can\u2019t build mutual trust unless you see yourself as one with your\nteam.\n\n### \ud83e\udd76 How do managers undermine ownership?\n\nIneffective and insecure leaders find solace in micromanaging.\n\nFor a weak leader, dictating the details is a great lifeline.\n\nIt can bring a sense of security as you are seen doing things.\n\nIf projects are stuck because you haven\u2019t built a framework that governs how\ndecisions are made and disputes are resolved, you can parachute in, steamroll\ndecisions, claim some immediate wins, all the while diverting attention from\nyour own shortcomings. If your recommendations don\u2019t work out, your proximity\nto the solutions can help you identify things to nitpick and shift blame.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f One way managers try to outrun these issues is by building a pipeline of\nnew blood to replace their burned out teams - building a sputtering engine of\nsmall short term wins vs. a continuous one that builds momentum over time.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Since short term wins can hide incompetence, execs and boards need to be\nextra vigilant and consider not only the numbers but at what long term cost\nthey\u2019re being obtained.\n\n\ud83c\udf31Overall, to drive performance, before debugging org processes, workflows,\ncarrots and sticks, it\u2019s important to make sure that the management team has\nbuilt a solid org operating system that empowers people and pushes decision\nmaking down as much as possible.\n\n(With the ownership foundation laid out, in a future post, we will cover\nimplementation details of such an org operating system to drive high\nperformance.
