For the first time in history, increased\nperformance requires increasing costs and this coincides with an explosion of\ndemand for more compute power driven by AI.\n\nOur current mechanisms for training AI systems utilise a narrow set of\nalgorithms and hardware building blocks, which require significant capital to\ndevelop and manufacture. The combination of this significance and scarcity has\nfar-reaching economic, geopolitical and societal implications.\n\nWhat we\u2019re shooting for:\n\nWe see an opportunity to draw inspiration from natural processing systems,\nwhich innately process complex information more efficiently (on several orders\nor magnitude) than today\u2019s largest AI systems.\n\nOur goal: to increase + open up new vectors of progress in the field of\ncomputing by reducing the cost of AI hardware.\n\nIn doing so, we\u2019ll open up new opportunities to reap the economic + social\nbenefits of AI, from accelerating scientific research to improving the\nefficiency of our public services.\n\n#### Document library\n\nSome key resources to understand the context for this programme:\n\n  * Opportunity space: Nature Computes Better\n  * Programme thesis: Unlocking AI compute hardware at 1/1000th the cost\n  * Programme presentation\n\nEverything you need to know to apply:\n\n  * Call for proposals\n  * How we select projects\n  * Concept paper guidelines\n  * Full proposal guidelines\n  * Template funding agreements\n  * Applicant walkthrough for the portal\n  * Funding FAQs\n  * Clarification questions\n\nIf you require an accessible version of any of these documents, please contact\nclarifications@aria.org.uk\n\n## Apply for funding\n\nWe are now looking for R&D Creators, individuals and teams that ARIA will fund\nand support, to pursue this goal. At this point, this programme consists of\nfour technical areas (TAs) across two different solicitations.\n\nThe first solicitation consists of TA1 Bold Solutions, TA2 Bold Ideas and TA3\nSystem-level Software Simulation \u2013 submit your full proposal by 07 May 2024.\n\nThe second solicitation will launch 03 June 2024 and will consist of TA4\nTesting and Evaluation.\n\nDownload the full funding call\n\n## Application timeline\n\nSolicitation| Concept paper - open for submission| Concept paper - submission\ndeadline*| Concept paper - review and feedback| Full proposal - open for\nsubmission| Full proposal - deadline| Submit your application  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nTA1-3| 13.03.24| 27.03.24 (12pm GMT)| 28.03.24 - 11.04.24| 15.04.24| 07.05.24\n(12pm BST)| Apply here  \n  \nSolicitation\n\nTA1-3\n\nConcept paper - open for submission\n\n13.03.24\n\nConcept paper - submission deadline*\n\n27.03.24 (12pm GMT)\n\nConcept paper - review and feedback\n\n28.03.24 - 11.04.24\n\nFull proposal - open for submission\n\n15.04.24\n\nFull proposal - deadline\n\n07.05.24 (12pm BST)\n\nSubmit your application\n\nApply here\n\n*Concept papers are designed to make the solicitation process as efficient as possible for applicants. By soliciting short concept papers, ARIA reviewers are able to gauge the feasibility and relevance of the proposed project and give an initial indication of whether we think a full proposal would be competitive. Applicants can submit a full proposal even if they miss the concept paper deadline.\n\n## Meet Suraj Bramhavar\n\nSuraj aims to redefine the way computers process information. He\u2019ll direct\nfunding into how we can build more efficient computers using principles\nubiquitously found in nature.\n\nPrior to ARIA, Suraj was co-founder and CTO of Sync Computing, a VC-backed\nstartup optimising the use of modern cloud computing resources. The company\nwas spun-out from his research at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. Prior to that, Suraj\nworked at Intel Corp, helping transition silicon photonics technology from an\nR&D effort into a now >$1BN business.\n\nSee more about Suraj's opportunity space\n\nMeet our other Programme Directors\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Advanced Research and Invention Agency 2024\n\n", "frontpage": false}
