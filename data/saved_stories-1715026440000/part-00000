and\nabroad as Yom HaShoah (Hebrew: \u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u05e9\u05d5\u05d0\u05d4, Yiddish: \u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u05e9\u05d5\u05d0\u05d4) and in English\nas Holocaust Remembrance Day, or Holocaust Day, is observed as Israel's day of\ncommemoration for the approximately six million Jews murdered in the Holocaust\nby Nazi Germany and its collaborators, and for the Jewish resistance in that\nperiod.^[2] In Israel, it is a national memorial day. The first official\ncommemorations took place in 1951, and the observance of the day was anchored\nin a law passed by the Knesset in 1959. It is held on the 27th of Nisan (which\nfalls in April or May), unless the 27th would be adjacent to the Jewish\nSabbath, in which case the date is shifted by a day.^[3]\n\n## Origins[edit]\n\n### Rabbinate-instituted day (1949\u20131950)[edit]\n\nThe first Holocaust Remembrance Day in Israel took place on December 28, 1949,\nfollowing a decision of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel that an annual memorial\nshould take place on the Tenth of Tevet, a traditional day of mourning and\nfasting in the Hebrew calendar. The day was marked by the burial in a\nJerusalem cemetery of ashes and bones of thousands of Jews brought from the\nFlossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp and religious ceremonies held in honor of the\nvictims. A radio program on the Holocaust was broadcast that evening. The\nfollowing year, in December 1950, the Rabbinate, organizations of former\nEuropean Jewish communities and the Israel Defense Forces held memorial\nceremonies around the country; they mostly involved funerals, in which objects\nsuch as desecrated Torah scrolls and the bones and ashes of the dead brought\nfrom Europe were interred.^[4]\n\n### Knesset-instituted day (1951\u20131958)[edit]\n\nIn 1951, the Knesset began deliberations to choose a date for Holocaust\nRemembrance Day. On April 12, 1951, after also considering as possibilities\nthe Tenth of Tevet, the 14th of Nisan, which is the day before Passover and\nthe day on which the Warsaw Ghetto uprising (April 19, 1943) began, and\nSeptember 1, the date on which the Second World War began, the Knesset passed\na resolution establishing the 27 Nisan in the Hebrew calendar, a week after\nPassover, and eight days before Israel Independence Day as the annual\nHolocaust and Ghetto Uprising Remembrance Day.^[4]^[5]^[6]\n\nOn May 3, 1951, the first officially organized Holocaust Remembrance Day event\nwas held at the Chamber of the Holocaust on Mount Zion; the Israel Postal\nService issued a special commemorative envelope; and a bronze statue of\nMordechai Anielewicz, the leader of the Warsaw Ghetto revolt, was unveiled at\nYad Mordechai, a kibbutz named for him. From the following year, the lighting\nof six beacons in memory of the six million Jews murdered by the Nazis became\na standard feature of the official commemoration of Holocaust Memorial\nDay.^[4]\n\n### Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Day Law (1959)[edit]\n\nOn April 8, 1959, the Knesset officially established the day when it passed\nthe Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Day Law with the purpose of instituting\nan annual \"commemoration of the disaster which the Nazis and their\ncollaborators brought upon the Jewish people and the acts of heroism and\nrevolt performed.\" The law was signed by the Prime Minister of Israel, David\nBen-Gurion, and the President of Israel, Yitzhak Ben-Zvi. It established that\nthe day would be observed by a two-minute silence when all work would come to\na halt throughout the country, memorial gatherings and commemorative events in\npublic and educational institutions would be held, flags would be flown at\nhalf mast, and programs relevant to the day would be presented on the radio\nand in places of entertainment. An amendment to the law in 1961 mandated that\ncafes, restaurants and clubs be closed on the day.^[4]^[7]\n\n## Commemoration[edit]\n\n### Israel[edit]\n\n#### Date[edit]\n\nThe date is set in accordance with the Hebrew calendar, on 27 Nisan, so that\nit varies in regard to the Gregorian calendar. Observance of the day is moved\nback to the Thursday before, if 27 Nisan falls on a Friday (as in 2021), or\nforward a day, if 27 Nisan falls on a Sunday (to avoid adjacency with the\nJewish Sabbath, as in 2024). The fixed Jewish calendar ensures 27 Nisan does\nnot fall on Saturday.^[3]^[2]\n\n#### Evening[edit]\n\nYom HaShoah opens in Israel at sundown^[8] in a state ceremony held in Warsaw\nGhetto Square at Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes Authority, in\nJerusalem. During the ceremony the national flag is lowered to half mast, the\nPresident and the Prime Minister both deliver speeches, Holocaust survivors\nlight six torches symbolizing the approximately six million Jews murdered in\nthe Holocaust and the Chief Rabbis recite prayers.^[9]\n\n#### Daytime[edit]\n\nOn Yom HaShoah, ceremonies and services are held at schools, military bases\nand by other public and community organizations.^[10]\n\nOn the eve of Yom HaShoah and the day itself, places of public entertainment\nare closed by law. Israeli television airs Holocaust documentaries and\nHolocaust-related talk shows, and low-key songs are played on the radio. Flags\non public buildings are flown at half mast. At 10:00 a.m., an air raid siren\nsounds throughout the country and Israelis are expected to observe two\nminutes^[11] of solemn reflection. It is customary to pause what is being done\nand to reflect, including motorists who stop their cars in the middle of the\nroad, standing beside their vehicles in silence as the siren is sounded.^[12]\n\n  * Flags at half mast at sundown on Yom HaShoah\n\n  * Sirens blare at 10:00 a.m. as motorists exit their cars and stand in silence in front of the Prime Minister's House in Jerusalem and throughout Israel on Yom HaShoah.\n\n  * Duration: 39 seconds.0:39\n\nVideo: Two minutes in silence in Tel Aviv\n\n### Abroad[edit]\n\nThe March of the Living from Auschwitz to Birkenau is held annually on Yom\nHaShoah.\n\nJewish communities and individuals throughout the world commemorate Yom\nHaShoah in synagogues as well as in the broader Jewish community. Many hold\ntheir commemorative ceremonies on the closest Sunday to Yom HaShoah as a more\npractical day for people to attend, while some mark the day on April 19, the\nanniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. Jewish schools also hold Holocaust-\nrelated educational programs on or near Yom HaShoah.^[13]^[14]\n\nCommemorations typically include memorial services and communal vigils and\neducational programs. These programs often include talks by Holocaust\nsurvivors (although this is becoming less common as time passes and there are\nfewer survivors who remain alive), candle-lighting ceremonies, the recitation\nof memorial prayers, the Mourner's Kaddish and appropriate songs and readings.\nSome communities read the names of Holocaust victims or show Holocaust-themed\nfilms.^[14]\n\nSince 1988 in Poland, a memorial service has been held after a three-kilometer\nwalk by thousands of participants from Auschwitz to Birkenau in what has\nbecome known as \"The March of the Living\".^[15]^[16]\n\nYom HaShoah is also commemorated by Australian Jews. In 2022, Treasurer Josh\nFrydenberg, who is Jewish, commemorated Yom HaShoah at the Melbourne Hebrew\nCongregation on the synagogue's 180th anniversary.^[17]\n\nWhile in Europe Holocaust Remembrance Day is celebrated on the anniversary of\nthe liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp by the Soviet military in\n1945, the Israeli government chose to commemorate a day that honored Jewish\nresistance and heroism in the face of the Nazi genocide.\n\n## Religious observances and liturgy[edit]\n\nIn the last few decades all the prayerbooks of Conservative^[18] and Reform\nJudaism^[19] have developed similar liturgies to be used on Yom HaShoah. The\nsiddurim of these groups add passages that are meant to be added to standard\nweekday service, as well as stand-alone sections. These liturgies generally\ninclude:\n\n  * Lighting of a candle (often each member of the congregation lights one)\n  * Modern poems, including \"I believe in the sun even when it is not shining...\"\n  * El Malei Rahamim (God, full of mercy, dwelling on high)\n  * Mourner's Kaddish\n\nIn response to the lack of liturgy dedicated to Yom HaShoah, Daniel Gross\ncomposed, in 2009, I Believe: A Shoah Requiem, a complete musical liturgy\ndedicated to the observance of Yom HaShoah. An a cappella oratorio scored for\ncantor, soprano solo, adult chorus and children's chorus, I Believe features\nseveral traditional prayer texts such as the Mourner's Kaddish (Kaddish Yatom)\nand the El Malei memorial prayer, and also includes the poetry of Paul Celan\nand Primo Levi. On April 7, 2013, I Believe had its world premiere^[20]\npresentation at Orchestra Hall at the Max M. Fisher Music Center in Detroit,\nMichigan.\n\n### Orthodox Judaism[edit]\n\nWhile there are Orthodox Jews who commemorate the Holocaust on Yom HaShoah,\nothers in the Orthodox community, especially Haredim, including Hasidim,\nremember the victims of the Holocaust in their daily prayers and on\ntraditional days of mourning that were already in place before the Holocaust,\nsuch as Tisha B'Av in the summer, and the Tenth of Tevet in the winter,\nbecause in the Jewish tradition the month of Nisan is considered a joyous\nmonth associated with Passover and messianic redemption. The moment of silence\nis by some purposely ignored because of the non-Jewish origins of this sort of\nmemorial.^[21] Some Haredi rabbis recommend adding piyyutim (religious poems)\nabout the Holocaust to the liturgy of Tisha B\u2019Av; some adherents follow this\nadvice.^[22]^[23]\n\n### Conservative Judaism[edit]\n\nA lit Yom HaShoah Yellow Candle\n\nIn 1981, members of the Federation of Jewish Men's Clubs FJMC, a branch of the\nmainstream Conservative/Masorti movement, created a special memorial project\nspecifically for Yom HaShoah. A dedicated yahrzeit candle was conceived, with\nyellow wax and a barbed-wire Star of David logo reminiscent of the armbands\nJews were forced to wear during the Holocaust. This object has come to be\nknown as the Yellow Candle. Approximately 200,000 candles are distributed\naround the world each year, along with relevant prayers and meditations.^[24]\n\nIn 1984, Conservative Rabbi David Golinkin wrote an article in Conservative\nJudaism journal suggesting a program of observance for the holiday, including\nfasting. In his article he noted that while private fasts are indeed\nprohibited during the month of Nisan (a major Orthodox objection to the\nplacement of the day), communal fasts for tragedies befalling Jewish\ncommunities had indeed been declared throughout the pre-Modern period.^[25]\n\nAnother prominent Conservative Jewish figure shared the Orthodox sentiment\nabout not adopting Yom HaShoah. Ismar Schorsch, former Chancellor of\nConservative Judaism's Jewish Theological Seminary of America held that\nHolocaust commemoration should take place on Tisha b'Av.^[26]\n\nThe Masorti (Conservative) movement in Israel has created Megillat HaShoah, a\nscroll and liturgical reading for Yom HaShoah. This publication was a joint\nproject of Jewish leaders in Israel, the United States and Canada.^[27]\n\nIn 2011, the FJMC introduced a related Yellow Candle concept for use on\nKristallnacht (The Night of Shattered Glass), November 9\u201310, commemorating the\nfirst organised Nazi pogrom of Jews in 1938, and other important Shoah\ncommemoration dates. Called the Ner Katan, FJMC's new version consists of six\nYellow Candles provided for communal observances and ceremonies.^[citation\nneeded]\n\nMore recently Conservative rabbis and lay leaders in the US, Israel and Canada\ncollaborated to write Megillat Hashoah (The Holocaust Scroll). It contains\npersonal recollections of Holocaust survivors. A responsum was written by\nRabbi Golinkin expressing the view that not only is it legitimate for the\nmodern Jewish community to write a new scroll of mourning, it was also\nincumbent to do so.^[28]\n\n### Reform Judaism[edit]\n\nReform Jewish congregations have tended to commemorate the memory of the\nHolocaust either on International Holocaust Remembrance Day or on Yom HaShoah.\nThese commemorations of the Holocaust have used a ceremony that is loosely\nmodeled after a Passover Seder. The focus of the seder has changed with time.\nThe earlier Holocaust seders commemorated the losses of the Holocaust through\na reenactment events from the Holocaust^[29] and through the lighting of six\nyahrzeit candles to reflect the approximately 6 million Jews murdered.^[30]\nMore modern Haggadot for Yom HaShoah, such as Gathering from the\nWhirlwind,^[31]^[32] have concentrated on renewal,^[33] remembrance, and the\ncontinuity of Jewish life.\n\nIn 1988 the American Reform movement published Six Days of Destruction (Elie\nWiesel and Rabbi Albert Friedlander). Narratives from Holocaust survivors are\njuxtaposed with the six days of creation found in Genesis.^[34]\n\n## Gregorian dates[edit]\n\nUpcoming dates of observance:^[35]\n\n  * 2023: Tuesday, April 18\n  * 2024: Monday, May 6\n  * 2025: Wednesday, April 23\n  * 2026: Monday, April 13\n  * 2027: Monday, May 3\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Days of Remembrance of the Victims of the Holocaust\n  * Holocaust Memorial Day\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ If the 27th day of Nisan falls on a Friday, the day is commemorated on Thursday, the 26th day of Nisan.

Por considera\u00e7\u00e3o, pois, para com todos \u00eastes aspectos daquele vulto not\u00e1vel, proponho que a sess\u00e3o seja interrompida durante 10 minutos, conservando-se os Srs. Senadores sentados nos seus lugares e silenciosos durante \u00easse espa\u00e7o de tempo. (Apoiados gerais). \u00c0s 14 horas e 45 minutos foi, portanto, suspensa a sess\u00e3o, reabrindo-se \u00e0s 14 e 55 minutos. The President: I must fulfill the painful duty of communicating to the Senate the death in Rio de Janeiro of the baron of Rio Branco, who made his name illustrious with the manner in which he conducted the diplomatic business of Brazil as well as with the erudition manifested in his work, and who honored his Portuguese origins with grandeur. Furthermore, we must remember that the baron of Rio Branco was a Minister of the government that first recognized the Portuguese Republic. Thus, in consideration of all these aspects related to this notable figure, I propose that the session be interrupted for 10 minutes, with the Senators remaining on their seats in silence for that period of time. At 14 hours and 45 minutes the session was therefore suspended, reopening at 14 hours and 55 minutes.\"\n  22. ^ \"Yom Hashoah: Holocaust Memorial Day\". My Jewish Learning.
