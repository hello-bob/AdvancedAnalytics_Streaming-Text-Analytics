Hardware aside, this means\nworking on training material too. Several self- paced courses have been\nreleased and for free too!Nvidia once a company that exclusively catered for\ngamers by releasing state of the art GPUs, has now become an AI company. This\nhappened as a side effect of the research they've been doing in their quest to\nproduce ever evolving graphic cards. That lead them to the discovery of the\ntensor cores that are now used to train Large Language Models.Demand for chips\nsky rocketed, stock prices went up and innovation reached new highs with the\nlatest offering of the Blackwell AI chip, the next gen ancestor of the $40,000\nH100 chips.This AI hardware endeavor however has rubbed off onto Software too.\nNot long ago NVIDIA released ChatRTX, \"Your Personalized AI Chatbot\" that lets\nyou personalize a GPT large language model (LLM) that connects to your own\ncontent - docs, notes, or other data. Leveraging retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG), TensorRT-LLM, and RTX acceleration, you could query a custom\nchatbot to quickly get contextually relevant answers. And all of that running\nlocally on your Windows RTX PC or workstation.This was followed by the\ncompany's Chief's statement that everyone can now be a programmer thanks to\nthe advent of generative AI. Ultimately you will be speaking at your computer\nwhich will blindly obey your commands without emitting compiler errors...That\nmight not happen in the near future but nevertheless, Nvidia has set out to\neducate and inform the public on what gen AI is and what it can do. Therefore\nas part of the Deep Learning Institute they offer a collection of courses, of\nwhich eight are self-paced as well as free. They are:1\\. Generative AI\nExplained In this no-coding course, you'll learn Generative AI concepts and\napplications, as well as the challenges and opportunities in this exciting\nfield. Learning Objectives:\n\n  * Define Generative AI and explain how Generative AI works\n  * Describe various Generative AI applications\n  * Explain the challenges and opportunities in Generative AI\n\n2\\. Getting Started with AI on Jetson Nano Build and train a classification\ndata set and model with the NVIDIA Jetson Nano. Learning Objectives:\n\n  * Set up your Jetson Nano and camera\n  * Collect image data for classification models\n  * Annotate image data for regression models\n  * Train a neural network on your data to create your models\n\n3\\. Building A Brain in 10 Minutes This notebook explores the biological\ninspiration for early neural networks. Learning Objectives:\n\n  * Explore how neural networks use data to learn\n  * Understand the math behind a neuron\n\n4\\. Building Video AI Applications at the Edge on Jetson Nano In this course,\nyou'll use JupyterLab notebooks and Python application samples on your Jetson\nNano to build new projects that extract meaningful insights from video streams\nthrough deep learning video analytics. The techniques you learn from this\ncourse can then be applied to your own projects in the future on the Nano or\nother Jetson platforms at the Edge.5\\. Augment your LLM Using Retrieval\nAugmented Generation In this introductory course, you\u2019ll be provided with a\nhigh-level overview of Retrieval Augmented Generation and how it improves\nGenerative AI (GenAI).6\\. Building RAG Agents with LLMs Agents powered by\nlarge language models (LLMs) have shown great retrieval capability for using\ntools, looking at documents, and plan their approaches. This course will show\nyou how to deploy an agent system in practice with the flexibility to scale up\nyour system to meet the demands of users and customers.7\\. Accelerate Data\nScience Workflows with Zero Code Changes In this course, you\u2019ll learn to use\nRAPIDS to speed up your CPU-based data science workflows. Learning Objectives:\n\n  * Understand the benefits of a unified workflow across CPUs and GPUs for data science tasks.\n  * Learn how to GPU-accelerate various data processing and machine learning workflows with zero code changes.\n  * Experience the significant reduction in processing time when workflows are GPU-accelerated.\n\n8\\. Introduction to AI in the Data Center In this course on Coursera, you'll\nlearn about AI, machine learning, deep learning, GPU architecture, deep\nlearning frameworks, and deploying AI workloads on Data Centers.The courses\nspan from 1 to 8 hours in duration and are addressed to technical beginners\nand intermediates.From this list of courses which for instance teach how to\nbuild RAG agents, it is inferred that the \"everyone can be a programmer\"\nstatement might be a bit overrated. In any case this is a first class\nopportunity to get into the world of GenAI.\n\n#### More Information\n\n1.Generative AI Explained2.Getting Started with AI on Jetson Nano3.Building A\nBrain in 10 Minutes4.Building Video AI Applications at the Edge on Jetson\nNano5.Augment your LLM Using Retrieval Augmented Generation6.Building RAG\nAgents with LLMs7.Accelerate Data Science Workflows with Zero Code\nChanges8.Introduction to AI in the Data Center\n\n#### Related Articles\n\nNvidia Releases Updated AI FrameworkProgram Deep Learning on the GPU with\nTritonNVIDIA's Turing - A Big Leap Forward For GPUsNVIDIA's Neural Network\nDrives A CarNVIDA Updates Free Deep Learning SoftwareTo be informed about new\narticles on I Programmer, sign up for our weekly newsletter, subscribe to the\nRSS feed and follow us on Twitter, Facebook or Linkedin.| Excel Spreadsheet -\nA Joke? 01/04/2024No this isn't an April Fool's although in places it seems\nlike one.
