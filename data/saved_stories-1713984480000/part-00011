Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n# Steve Jobs was wrong about the post-PC era and the next batch of iPads\nshould embrace this\n\nNews\n\nBy Lance Ulanoff\n\npublished 13 hours ago\n\nWhat is an iPad, really?\n\n(Image credit: Lance Ulanoff)\n\nThe original iPad was important enough to get its own live on-stage\nintroduction by the late Steve Jobs. It was such a revolutionary idea that it\npredates the iPhone and we might've been using Apple's first tablet in 2007 if\nSteve Jobs hadn't steered the technology to a pocketable format.\n\nAfter the January 27, 2010 launch, the world, for a time, seemed to revolve\naround Apple's iPad, a silicon, glass, and metal gadget so ground-breaking it\nrated its own storyline on the then wildly popular Modern Family TV series (it\nwas really like a 22-minute ad with a lot of jokes).\n\nIt's a different story for the iPads we're expecting on May 7. Instead of a\nbig, breathless live event, Apple will launch the tablets (and probably a new\nApple Pencil) virtually. That means a pre-taped, Apple CEO Tim Cook-hosted\naffair that will breeze through four or more new gadgets with deep dives into\nthe new screen technology (OLED?), new designs (thinner than ever!), wireless\ncharging (oh, please make this so), and a completely reimagined Apple Pencil.\n\nIt'll be exciting, in a way, but also anti-climactic.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM techradar\n\n## The first and best true tablet\n\n(Image credit: Lance Ulanoff)\n\n14 years ago, I sat in the audience as Steve Jobs explained his vision for a\npost-PC world and the need for a device that sat between the then-popular\nNetbook laptops and its own wildly successful iPhone. Jobs didn't just explain\nthis: behind him, the word \"iPad\" dramatically materialized between a netbook\nand an iPhone.\n\nJobs, a tiny figure before the screen, held up the iPad to wild applause.\n\nFrom that point forward, Jobs dove into the demo, showing us photos, maps,\nnewspapers, and apps on the 9.7-inch iOS screen (there was no iPadOS back\nthen). As radical as the iPad introduction appeared, Jobs knew that we already\nunderstood the product. Since there are 75 million iPhones and iPods sold,\nthere are, said Jobs, \"over 75 million people who already know how to use the\niPad.\"\n\n## Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\n\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion,\nanalysis and more from the TechRadar team.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nLike the showman he was, Jobs didn't hold back on hyperbole, declaring, \"Our\nmost advanced technology in a magical and revolutionary product at an\nunbelievable price.\" Much like the iPhone before it, the iPad started at a\nrelatively affordable $499 and has only gotten more expensive since then.\n\n## A new era\n\nImage 1 of 3\n\n(Image credit: Lance Ulanoff)\n\n(Image credit: Lance Ulanoff)\n\n(Image credit: Lance Ulanoff)\n\nMonths later at the AllThingsD conference, Jobs said, \"PCs are going to be\nlike trucks. They are still going to be around [but] one out of x people will\nneed them.\" Later he added, \"We like to talk about the post-PC era, but when\nit really starts to happen, it's uncomfortable.\"\n\nI praised Jobs as an \"oracle,\" and the numbers backed him up. By 2011, Apple\nwas reporting 15 million iPads sold and owned 90% of the tablet market share.\n\nJob, though, was wrong and, in the intervening years, the iPad seen\ndiminishing sales and has twisted itself through iPadOS updates and keyboard\naccessories into another ultra-computer option. It's a tablet but also a\npersonal computer or \"PC\". There is no post-PC world, just a world of laptops\nand tablets that are racing toward the middle.\n\nWhile the iPad has, with the Magic Keyboard and mouse support, become more\nlaptop-like, traditional Windows laptops have adopted tablet features like\ntouchscreens and stylus support.\n\nThe question for this next generation of iPads is whether they will further\nblur the line between PCs and tablets or reestablish the distinction. It was a\nself-contained slab that could do it all, without accessories\n\nAside from describing access to a full-size virtual keyboard (and, yes, a\nhardware keyboard that was almost unusable because it positioned the iPad just\nmillimeters away from the top row of keys), Steve Jobs in 2010 illustrated how\nyou could accomplish myriad entertainment, content, and productivity task\nthrough a touch screen. He positioned the original iPad as the best book and\nnewspaper reader (The New York Times was a launch-day partner) but also a\nfantastic gaming platform. It could be your word processor and your\nspreadsheet manager. It was lighter than a Netbook but far prettier and a lot\nmore fun to use.\n\n## Is it a PC?\n\n(Image credit: Lance Ulanoff)\n\nToday's iPad, iPad Mini, and especially iPad Pro are laptops in tablet's\nclothing. With Apple Silicon (up to the M2 in the iPad Pro), they match the\nperformance of last-generation MacBook Airs. The new models will surely\nfeature M3 chips.\n\nI'm not sorry the post-PC idea is dead. When Jobs floated it, I worked at a\npublication with \"PC\" in the name. I also knew consumers might not care so\nmuch about such technology labels. They loved the original iPad because it did\nso many things that a device of that form factor had never done (at least\nwell) before. It satisfied their cravings for content and entertainment and,\nto their surprise, was built to last.\n\nApple iPads sold 8 or 9 years ago are still working, which is of course part\nof the problem. You can't be Post-anything if the products last forever.\n\nFor the iPad line, the potential to alter the trajectory of computing is gone\nbut the opportunity to reestablish its place in the mobile technology market\nremains. Let's see if Apple chooses a new path.\n\n### You might also like\n\n  * A 14-inch iPad is a terrible idea, and I have proof\n  * I review laptops for a living, but after using an iPad for a week I might ...\n  * Can the iPad Mini survive?\n  * The best iPad: top Apple tablets to consider\n  * Apple may launch a foldable iPad in, but doubts remain ...\n\nLance Ulanoff\n\nEditor At Large\n\nA 38-year industry veteran and award-winning journalist, Lance has covered\ntechnology since PCs were the size of suitcases and \u201con line\u201d meant \u201cwaiting.\u201d\nHe\u2019s a former Lifewire Editor-in-Chief, Mashable Editor-in-Chief, and, before\nthat, Editor in Chief of PCMag.com and Senior Vice President of Content for\nZiff Davis, Inc.
