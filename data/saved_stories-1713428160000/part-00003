My contract with A included\na confidentiality agreement (with a survivorship clause that explicitly\nspecifies that it survives termination of employment and has no expiration).\nCompany A had layoffs and let me go.\n\nCompany B has a product Y that competes with X. B offered me a job working on\nY. If I accept the offer, sharing the proprietary information I possess about\nX with B would be both a contract violation and an ethical violation.\n\nHow do I avoid accidentally sharing that information? Everything I do is\ninformed by my accumulated knowledge, so inevitably some part of my decisions\nmade as an employee of B would be at least influenced by my knowledge of X. Is\nit possible to avoid the appearance of sharing that information (even if\nactual sharing doesn't happen)?\n\n  * ethics\n  * confidentiality\n  * conflict-of-interest\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this question\n\nFollow this question to receive notifications\n\nasked 20 hours ago\n\nNotSharingProprietaryInfoNotSharingProprietaryInfo\n\n20111 silver badge44 bronze badges\n\nNew contributor\n\nNotSharingProprietaryInfo is a new contributor to this site.

One of those conditions often is that the\nconfidentiality requirement is time-limited to some \"reasonable\" time frame.\nCompanies will still often try to push over-reaching NDAs that try to pretend\nthey are valid indefinitely, but that's just scare tactics with no legal basis\nand zero enforceability. So first of all make sure you know exactly which\nparts of what you signed are valid (if any) and which parts are just\nhandwaving and wishful thinking.\n\n\u2013 TooTea\n\n15 hours ago\n\n  * 2\n\nIs it reasonable to believe that one of the reasons you were hired was your\nknowledge of the product.

It will tell you some of this. I can't quote from\nany of the ones I signed because they all include clauses that say I can't do\nthat, but read your own in detail. Also keep in mind that overly broad NDAs\nare often set aside by courts, so if you act reasonably you will not be\nattracting legal or ethical jeopardy.]\n\nLet's say as part of working on X you learned a true fact like \"A is faster\nthan B\" or \"these screws don't rust in the environment X is deployed in\" or\n\"you should sharpen your chisel every day when carving this stuff\". If you,\nwhile working on Y, say \"for X we used A because it is faster\" you are\nrevealing information about X and possibly breaking your NDA. But if you say\n\"A is faster here\" or \"these screws don't rust in [seawater or whatever]\" or\n\"did you sharpen your chisel today?\" you are not.\n\nMost NDAs are much less enforceable than people think. They are often much\nless relevant also. Before something has been released, the information that\nit will have a particular feature is important and proprietary and should be\nprotected. Once it's released, that is in the press release! Yes, other things\nstay secret indefinitely, but not every scrap of information you know\nqualifies.\n\nYou should protect with the highest determination things like your old\nemployer's future plans for X, the names and contact details of former fellow\nemployees, the pricing and payment structures that were offered for X, what\nyour fellow employees were paid, and other \"inside details\" of the business.\nYou should also hold secret any super cool proprietary tricks that made X\nstand out from the rest - a different file format, a compression trick,\nsomething no one else has that made it somehow better in a way people didn't\nknow the mechanics of. You can be pretty calm about having learned which\nsorting algorithm is faster, or the command line options for a commonly used\nproduct in your industry, or other things which are not so much \"information\nabout X\" as they skills you have developed while working on X. To be\n\"influenced by your knowledge of X\" is not at all the same as \"to tell people\nhow X works internally.\"\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nanswered 13 hours ago\n\nKate GregoryKate Gregory\n\n150k6464 gold badges341341 silver badges454454 bronze badges\n\n3\n\n  * 2\n\n\"if you act reasonably you will not be attracting legal or ethical jeopardy\" \u2014\nbut they might drag you to waste time in court anyway.

No: Specifics on product's inner workings, formal requirements and specifications, parts, vendors, trade secrets.\n  2. No: business plans, financial data, costing, pricing, product road map.\n  3. No : organizational structure, compensation details, key employee names.\n  4. Yes: general best practices, industry and application/product domain knowledge (even if gained at the employer), frameworks/processes/tools (unless they are highly proprietary and home grown).\n  5. Be upfront and transparent. Tell your new employer upfront that you won't share any confidential details about your previous gig. A good employer will not only accept this, they will encourage you to do so (since it limits their own legal exposure risk). You can also tell your old employer that you fully intend to keep confidentiality as agreed: this can help make them less jumpy.\n  6. There will always be a gray area. If in doubt, get some input from a trusted (preferably neutral) entity.\n  7. Document your decisions to what to disclose or not and also document potential overlaps where you were NOT involved (protection against future legal action).\n\nTwo anecdotes:\n\nIn one meeting we were discussing a major product decision. There was a great\nsolution but I couldn't mention it since I'd had seen it recently at a\nprevious gig. I was biting my tongue until fortunately a very smart product\nmanager came independently up with the same solution. However, I CAREFULL\ndocumented the meeting and who said what when, so I could proof my non-\ninvolvement if needed.\n\nIn one case, I specifically reached out to my previous employer for advice on\nwhat to do in a specific \"gray area\" situation light of our agreement. It was\nhysterical: they had no idea how to handle a request like this and it took\nthem three month to come up with an extremely carefully worded reply that\nreally didn't say much :-)\n\n> it survives termination of employment and has no expiration)\n\nThat seems excessive and my be in violation of local labor laws or practices.\nI would suggest doing a bit of research on that one.\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nanswered 11 hours ago\n\nHilmarHilmar\n\n120k3636 gold badges236236 silver badges377377 bronze badges\n\n1\n\n  * This answer gives very good actionable advice.
