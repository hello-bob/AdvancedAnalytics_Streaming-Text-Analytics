It also offers a range of interface options to suit all user\nhabits, from traditional to modern, and makes the most of different screen\nform factors by optimising the space available on the desktop to put the\nmaximum number of features just a click or two away.\n\nThe most significant advantage of LibreOffice over other office suites is the\nLibreOffice Technology engine, a single software platform for all\nenvironments: desktop, cloud and mobile. This allows LibreOffice to provide a\nbetter user experience and produce identical, and interoperable, documents\nbased on both ISO standards: Open Document Format (ODT, ODS and ODP) for users\nconcerned about compatibility, resilience and digital sovereignty, and the\nproprietary Microsoft format(DOCX, XLSX and PPTX).\n\nA full description of all the new features of the LibreOffice 24.2 major\nrelease line can be found in the release notes [2].\n\nLibreOffice for Enterprises\n\nFor enterprise-class deployments, TDF strongly recommends the LibreOffice\nEnterprise family of applications from ecosystem partners \u2013 for desktop,\nmobile and cloud \u2013 with a wide range of dedicated value-added features and\nother benefits such as SLAs: https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-\nin-business/\n\nEvery line of code developed by ecosystem companies for enterprise customers\nis shared with the community on the master code repository and contributes to\nthe improvement of the LibreOffice Technology platform.\n\nAvailability of LibreOffice 24.2.3 Community\n\nLibreOffice 24.2.3 Community is available at\nhttps://www.libreoffice.org/download/.
