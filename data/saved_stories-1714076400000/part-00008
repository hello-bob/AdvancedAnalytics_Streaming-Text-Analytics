I will leave commentary on the substance of the rule to\nothers, because I like to keep the posts here politically neutral1. But I did\nwant to talk briefly about the procedure of agency rulemaking, since I don\u2019t\nthink most programmers (even in the United States) are familiar with the\nlifecycle of a federal agency rule.\n\nWhen an impactful rule like this one is announced, and gets an effective date,\nit\u2019s actually in the middle of its road to adoption, not the end. It has gone\nthrough a notice and comment process, where the public is able to provide\nfeedback on the rule to which the agency must respond. But at this point, the\nrule has not gone through judicial review, which means its future is still\nhighly uncertain.\n\nI have seen many people dismissing concerns that the rule will be overturned\nwhen challenged in court. They typically say something like, \u201cCongress gave\nthe FTC the authority to pass this rule,\u201d and leave it at that. But such a\nblanket statement fails to capture the reality of the process that will\nactually occur.\n\nIn practice, Congressional grants of authority are almost always vague. If\nthere was a statute passed by Congress that said, \u201cThe FTC shall have the\nauthority to decide whether noncompete clauses in employment contracts can be\nenforced,\u201d then perhaps this would be more straightforward. But even then, you\nwould probably see lawsuits concerning what precisely constitutes a\n\u201cnoncompete clause\u201d, and which \u201cemployment contracts\u201d are covered.\n\nIn this case, there is nothing so specific. The FTC declared this rule\npursuant to a general grant of authority to regulate anti-competitive\nbehavior. So, when the lawsuits begin, the Executive branch will have to\ndefend the rule by showing that Congress\u2019s wording intended to grant it the\nauthority to regulate specific clauses in contracts between employers and\nemployees, even though such clauses are not explicitly enumerated in the grant\nof authority.\n\nBecause this rule is so far-reaching, the \u201cmajor questions doctrine\u201d is likely\nto be invoked by the parties challenging the rule. The major questions\ndoctrine is a doctrine of judicial review holding that if Congress wants an\nagency to be able to promulgate a particularly impactful type of rule, the\nstatute has to say so explicitly.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, it is very premature to assume that this rule is the new\nlaw of the land. It is always difficult to guess how the judicial process will\nunfold, but if past cases are any indication, defending this rule will not be\ntrivial. The Executive branch may prevail \u2014 but they very well might not.\n\nThat said, as with everything here on Computer, Enhance, I don\u2019t want you to\ntake my word for any of this. I much prefer people to experience things\nthemselves, so they can learn how things work and draw their own conclusions.\n\nTo that end, if this is a topic that interests you, I would recommend taking\nan hour to listen to the Supreme Court oral arguments in West Virginia v EPA.\nThis is the best recent case \u2014 it\u2019s from 2021 \u2014 that covers the major\nquestions doctrine, and I suspect the eventual \u201cFTC noncompete rule case\u201d\narguments will unfold in a similar fashion.\n\nFinally, to my original point that you cannot assume the FTC rule will survive\nbased purely on a general grant of authority: despite having arguably a more\nspecific grant of authority than is at issue in this FTC rule, the government\nlost West Virginia v EPA, specifically because of the major questions\ndoctrine.\n\n1\n\nA say \u201cpolitically\u201d, because as I\u2019m sure most people have already noticed,\nthey are far from neutral on programming issues!\n\n### Subscribe to Computer, Enhance!\n\nBy Casey Muratori \u00b7 Thousands of paid subscribers\n\nProgramming courses, interviews, commentary.\n\n7 Likes\n\n7\n\nShare this post\n\n#### A Brief Note on the FTC Noncompete Rule\n\nwww.computerenhance.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nWelcome to the Performance-Aware Programming Series!\n\nA brief introduction explaining what \"performance-aware programming\" is, and\nwhat the course will be about.\n\nFeb 1, 2023 \u2022\n\nCasey Muratori\n\n683\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Welcome to the Performance-Aware Programming Series!\n\nwww.computerenhance.com\n\n93\n\n22:05\n\nWaste\n\nWatch now (33 min) | How many CPU instructions does Python take to do one CPU instruction?\n\nFeb 2, 2023 \u2022\n\nCasey Muratori\n\n595\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Waste\n\nwww.computerenhance.com\n\n172\n\n32:56\n\n\"Clean\" Code, Horrible Performance\n\nMany programming \"best practices\" taught today are performance disasters\nwaiting to happen.\n\nFeb 28, 2023 \u2022\n\nCasey Muratori\n\n464\n\nShare this post\n\n#### \"Clean\" Code, Horrible Performance\n\nwww.computerenhance.com\n\n129\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Casey Muratori\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
