Every set up I\u2019ve seen with a floor\nof wood chips is better than those I\u2019ve seen without, with very few\nexceptions.\n\nConsider keeping your chickens on a deep layer of wood chips or a similar bed\nof plant materials. Here is how and why.\n\n(What are wood chips?)\n\nThese are wood chips: chopped up trees.\n\nHealth\n\nThe first reason is to soak up the manure. Chickens pee and poop at the same\ntime, they do so throughout the day, and they do so throughout the night while\nthey\u2019re sleeping. It adds up fast.\n\nIf it\u2019s not cleaned up fast, it stinks to high heaven. That\u2019s no fun for us\nwhen we visit the birds, but think about them. They breathe that toxic air\n24/7. The harsh ammonia gas injures their respiratory pathway tissues, reduces\ntheir growth, makes them susceptible to diseases, makes them less productive\nat laying eggs, damages their eyes, and all sorts of other nasty things. (See\nthis paper and this paper for more on the effects of ammonia on chickens.)\n\nSo primarily it is for the health of the chickens that I keep a thick layer of\nwood chips on the floor of my coop and run. My rule is that I should be able\nto stand right inside and close my eyes and not even know there are chickens\naround because I can\u2019t smell anything unpleasant. The wood chips, if kept\nthick enough, accomplish that.\n\nI apply the chips at about a foot in depth at first and then later add some as\nthey decompose in order to keep the layer at least six inches deep.\n\nPile of wood chips next to my chicken pen and yard for additions when\nnecessary\n\nFood\n\nThis aspect of the floor of wood chips is mysterious to me, yet it is\nundeniable that when chickens live on such a floor it begins to create food\nfor them.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed that after a certain amount of time on the wood chips, I need to\nfeed the birds less. For example, today my chickens have been living on a deep\nbed of wood chips in a new yard area that I created about a year ago (May\n2023). At first, I needed to feed them a normal amount of \u201ccomplete ration\u201d of\nlayer crumble, just as if they lived in a sterile chicken house. Around four\nmonths later, I noticed that they weren\u2019t eating as much of the layer crumble\nas before. Around eight months later, I stopped buying bags of feed at all.\nHere, a year later, I give them zero such feed.\n\nFor months, I have been giving them only the usual kitchen and garden scraps,\nplus some sunflower seeds and wheat berries, and they look as healthy and act\nas happy as ever, and they are laying as many quality eggs as ever.\n\nMy daughter sprinkles wheat berries across the chicken yard.\n\nBut how? I see them pecking and finding things to eat within the wood chips. I\ncan\u2019t always see what it is they\u2019re finding, but the evidence says it\nsatisfies them.\n\nI came upon some studies from the 1940s and 1950s on chickens raised over\nsimilar \u201cdeep, old litter\u201d that found similar results. One from 1949 by\nKennard and Chamberlin done in Ohio found that chickens raised on a deep, old\n(at least six months old) litter bed could be fed less and still grow as well\nor better compared to chickens raised on a new bed and given a complete\nration. (See Table 8 on page 14 in \u201cThe Use of Compost (Built-up) Litter in\nChicken Houses.\u201d)\n\nA fork of the wood-chip bedding in the chicken yard. What do the chickens see\nthat we don\u2019t?\n\nCompost\n\nThe bed of wood chips decomposes with the help of the chickens\u2019 manure and\nscratching until it can eventually be considered compost. This might take a\nfew months, maybe a year, depending on the wood chips you begin with and the\nnumber of chickens and size of the area.\n\nThis resulting compost can be harvested and used in your vegetable garden,\naround fruit trees, as potting mix. I do all three with my chicken compost.\n\nCompost from my chicken coop and run, derived from mostly wood chips as the\noriginal ingredient.\n\nThis chicken compost has a couple advantages over pure chicken manure. First,\nit\u2019s a more versatile product. You can\u2019t grow vegetable seeds in pure chicken\nmanure, but you sure can in chicken compost.\n\nMy vegetable seedlings grown in compost from the chicken run on March 1, 2024.\n\nSecond, harvesting the compost takes less labor. Without wood chips, the\nmanure must be cleaned out almost daily in order to prevent an unhealthy\nenvironment for the birds. With wood chips, you might have a chore once a week\nat most. From time to time you add more wood chips and you fork an area that\nis capped, and then you might harvest compost a few times each year.\n\nRoof removed from coop. This is where the chickens roost at night.\nOccasionally, I twist a fork in the wood chips there if I see capping.\n\nChicken health, reduction of feed costs, and gaining compost are the three\nmain reasons that I have kept my chickens on a deep bed of wood chips for the\npast eight years, and many others have found the same benefits, and you might\ntoo. Unless you have one of these exceptional situations.\n\nExceptions\n\nMobile pen: I have kept chickens in a mobile pen and moved them daily so their\nfloor is ever-new pasture. In Southern California, this is most practical\nduring the winter and spring.\n\nNew ground every day means the chickens have new food to eat and don\u2019t leave\ntoo much poop in any one spot.\n\nMassive run/yard: I have friends with a large flock but also with a very large\npasture area for the flock to forage in. If the number of birds is small\nenough compared to the run area, then the chickens will not denude it and all\nwill be well.\n\nFriends in Oregon with a very large pasture area for their flock.\n\nBut the run area must be massive (bigger than most people think is big enough)\nor else it soon turns into bare ground because the chickens eat almost every\nplant, and then the ground becomes toxic with their manure.\n\nIn all other cases that I have seen, a deep floor of wood chips is the way to\ngo.\n\nResources\n\nI was first clued in to using a deep bed of wood chips for my chickens by Joel\nSalatin in his classic book, Pastured Poultry Profits. (See page 260 if you\nhave a copy. And if you raise chickens, you must have a copy.)\n\nHarvey Ussery also has a good chapter (7) on his experience using \u201cdeep\nlitter\u201d in his excellent book, The Small-Scale Poultry Flock.\n\nWhere to get wood chips?\n\nThanks for your support so I can keep these Yard Posts coming and ad-free.\n\nAll of my Yard Posts are listed HERE.\n\n  * Facebook\n\n  * Pinterest\n\n  * Share\n\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)\n\n# 7 Comments\n\n  1. Joe on April 20, 2024 at 7:58 am\n\nHi Greg, I\u2019ve been doing this for years and you are 100% correct. I first\nlearned this technique from Joel Salatin\u2018s books. I think he calls it deep\npack or something similar. I start with a thick layer of woodchips. When\nthings get messy I just add more woodchips. They also get all our kitchen\nscraps and yard waste. Basically my chicken coop is my compost pile, except I\ndon\u2019t have to turn my compost pile because the chickens do it for me. I clean\nit out twice a year and use it to mulch the garden. The areas of my yard that\nhave received this mulch show a rapid and long lasting improvement in the\nhealth and productivity of those plants. Eggs, healthier chickens, a self\nturning compost pile, and healthier plants \u2013 it\u2019s a win all the way around.\n\nReply\n\n     * Greg Alder on April 20, 2024 at 8:52 am\n\nThanks for this, Joe! I also first learned of this technique from Joel Salatin\nalong with Harvey Ussery. I\u2019ll add that to the post above.\n\nReply\n\n  2. Bruce Campbell on April 20, 2024 at 10:24 am\n\nThanks Greg! Insect larvae, other \u201cshredder\u201d organisms and worms, etc.,\nfeeding in the wood chip, decomposing manure and food scraps, become a\nconcentrated source of animal protein (a part of the natural wild food) for\nthe chickens. Germinating weed or grain seed shoots also come up through the\nwood chips (depending on the time of year). In effect, wood chip mulch becomes\nthe foundation of a natural food web linking mineral soil, microorganisms,\narthropods, worms, etc., right up to quadrupeds (and bipeds).\n\nReply\n\n     * Greg Alder on April 20, 2024 at 3:24 pm\n\nWell stated, Bruce. Thank you!\n\nReply\n\n  3. Judd on April 20, 2024 at 11:04 am\n\nI love this idea. I\u2019m wondering how this will affect our hen\u2019s ability to\naccess grit in the absence of dirt on the surface? Do you need to regularly\nadd grit to the surface of the wood chips? If feeding layer crumble, are you\nalso sprinkling it on top of the wood chips, or using a feeding tray?\n\nThanks!\n\nReply\n\n     * Greg Alder on April 20, 2024 at 3:36 pm\n\nHi Judd, I don\u2019t add grit. The chickens might get enough when they dig deeply\ninto the wood chips and reach dirt below (which I see them do sometimes), and\nthey might get enough when I let them out for a little roam before sunset\nevery couple days. I\u2019m not sure.\n\nWhen I fed layer crumble I did it both ways. It worked both ways. But what\nI\u2019ve come to appreciate about feeding only seeds is that there\u2019s less waste.\nIf a seed gets buried in the wood chips for a few days, it just germinates and\nthe chickens find it and eat it in a new form.\n\nReply\n\n  4. Randy B on April 20, 2024 at 4:14 pm\n\nI use a natural wood cat litter called \u00d6KOCAT. It has a nice pine smell and\nit\u2019s very absorbent, no litter box smell. Every day I remove the clumps and\nsolid waste into a separate container. When that container is full, I put it\non permanent piles of yard waste that I don\u2019t stir and from which I don\u2019t\nremove compost. The Internet will tell you that cat manure may contain\nToxoplasma gondii parasites, which come from eating birds and rodents and are\ndangerous, so poop should be safely thrown away where it only affects garbage\nmen. Not sure why cat poop is any more dangerous in a pile outside than a cat\nbox or in traces on a cat roaming around or sleeping in one\u2019s bed. Anyway, my\ncat doesn\u2019t eat birds she has caught; she gives them to me for release.\n\nReply\n\n### Submit a Comment Cancel reply\n\n## Welcome . . .\n\nI'm Greg.
