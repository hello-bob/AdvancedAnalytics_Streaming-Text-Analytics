The answer\nto such questions might not be known until the first creditor\u2019s meeting that\nmust be held by April 26.\n\nIt\u2019s an incredibly sad outcome for Tritium, which was a world pioneer in the\nrollout of EV fast charging infrastructure, despite the slow uptake of EVs in\nits home country.\n\nIt seized a more than 20 per cent share of the global market, a majority share\nof non-Tesla charging infrastructure in Australia and had an enormously\nsuccessful listing on the Nasdaq in early 2022 which valued the company at up\nto $2 billion.\n\nThat listing delivered massive windfall returns in the \u201chundreds of millions\u201d\nto its major backers, former coal barons Trevor St Baker and Brian Flannery.\n\nBut in the past year the company\u2019s share price has collapsed, and it was\nfacing a new threat of de-listing from the Nasdaq even after a 200-1 share\nconsolidation that left it with too little stock to meet listing guidelines.\n\nIts last listed share price valued the company at less than $US4 million. St\nBaker is believed to have retained a stake of around 24 per cent and had\nseveral significant loans with the company, while Flannery reportedly sold his\nremaining five per cent stake earlier this year.\n\nAmong the company\u2019s problems were reliability issues, particularly with its\nfirst generation equipment, and last year it announced it would close its\nBrisbane factory and move production to its US base in Tennessee, where it\nemploys 500 people. But it has failed to make a profit in recent years.\n\nThe company was founded by more than a decade ago by three university students\nwho took on some of the world\u2019s biggest car makers in the World Solar\nChallenge and went on to set up their own engineering firm. In 2012, they were\nasked to develop an EV fast-charger, which led to the RT50 DC fast charger.\n\nThe company says it has sold more than 13,000 DC fast chargers in more than 40\ncountries. At its peak it claimed to be the biggest maker of fast chargers in\nthe US with a 30 per cent market share (unclear if this included the Tesla\nnetwork), and a 75 per cent share in Australia, and one of the top three in\nEurope.\n\nIn Australia, it has been challenged by a number of players, including the\nrapidly expanding Tesla network that is now half open to other EV models, and\ncompetitors such as Kempower and ABB.\n\nTim Washington, the founder and head of Jet Charge, another Australian EV\ncharging company, said it was sad news for the industry.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of comments on this, but I have to tell you, as\nsomeone who has worked with them since they were in a shed in Queensland, it\u2019s\nan incredibly sad day for our industry,\u201d Washington wrote in response to some\ncomments to this story (see below).\n\n\u201cYou can argue all the reasons you want, but there\u2019s no doubt that for the\nhundreds of people who worked extremely hard and were passionate about EVs,\nthis is such a sad day.\u201d\n\nFor more on this story, please go to our sister site RenewEconomy: Not enough\ncapital: EV fast charger company Tritium collapses, receivers to seek buyers.\n\nGiles Parkinson\n\nGiles Parkinson is founder and editor of The Driven, and also edits and\nfounded the Renew Economy and One Step Off The Grid web sites.
