KG / Alamy\n\nIn This Story\n\nDestination Guide\n\n### Rapa Nui, Chile\n\n6 Articles\n\n7 Places\n\nA clutch of rafts floats on the ocean horizon, just visible from the shore of\nRapa Nui. It\u2019s hard to determine from this distance, but they vaguely define\nthe starting point of one of the island\u2019s most anticipated events: an annual\ntriathlon. But this is no ordinary triathlon.\n\nSpectators on shore point with outstretched fingers to the nearing athletes as\nthey furiously raft towards land. Paddling past the numerous sea turtles that\nglide around the bay, Tumaheke Dur\u00e1n Veri Veri arrives first. He heaves his\nhand-woven raft onto the sand and runs barefoot up to the island\u2019s main road.\nHe then hoists a 44-pound bundle of bananas over his shoulders and begins to\nrun.\n\nThis is the Tau\u2019a Rapa Nui; a demanding sporting event that honors the Rapa\nNui\u2019s ancestral tradition. It begins with the rafting, called Vaka Ama;\nfollowed by the banana-weighted run, the Aka Venga; and ends with a bodyboard-\ntype paddle race: Nataci\u00f3n con Pora. Dur\u00e1n Veri Veri returns to the bay on\nfoot, grabbing a second, smaller raft and launching once more into the ocean.\nHe maintains his lead for the last lap, passing the finishing line comfortably\nin first place.\n\nATLAS OBSCURA COURSES\n\nLearn with Us!\n\nCheck out our lineup of courses taught by world-class experts from around the\nworld. See Courses\n\nToday\u2019s event may seem simple enough, if challenging. But the inspiration for\nthe triathlon traces back to a dangerous competition involving bird eggs and,\nat one point, a volcanic crater.\n\nTumaheke Dur\u00e1n Veri Veri built his own raft out of reeds. Charis McGowan\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for the culture, also to show visitors the strength we have on\nthe island,\u201d says Dur\u00e1n Veri Veri, who is a local legend that has won the\nevent \u201c15, 16, 17\u201d times\u2014he\u2019s lost count of his exact number of titles. Now\n48, his first participation in the event was in the \u201890s. \u201cYou have to be\nconstant: Plan well, eat well, sleep well, and train year-round,\u201d he says.\n\nFollowing tradition, Dur\u00e1n Veri Veri handmade his two boats; the larger raft\nis made of 3,000 reeds, while the smaller Pora is around 700 reeds. The sheer\nchallenge of making the rafts is part of the tradition: \u201cIt takes a lot (of\neffort) just to collect the reeds. We go as a community; my family and friends\nare all behind me working together,\u201d he explains.\n\n> Rapa Nui clans used tournaments and challenges to determine pre-colonial\n> governance.\n\nThe Tau\u2019a Rapa Nui triathlon takes place during the annual celebration of\nTapati. Created to preserve the ancestral traditions of the island\u2019s\nPolynesian people, Tapati dates back to the 1970s. Famous for its enigmatic\nmonolith Moai statues, Rapa Nui (also known as Easter Island) was annexed by\nChile in 1888. It sits about 2,300 miles away from the country that governs it\nand retains a strong, independent identity. To this day, it is one of the most\nremote inhabited places in the world.\n\nThe Birdman cult used eggs from a sooty tern bird to determine governance of\nRapa Nui. SAWASSAKORN MUTTAPRAPRUT/Alamy\n\nIt\u2019s a culture that has endured hardships and struggles: the island\u2019s\nancestral practices and traditions were prohibited under Catholic rule, and\nthe Rapa Nui language was banned from being spoken in public. Slave raids and\ndiseases brought by European colonizers led to a drastic population decline\u2014in\n1877, the local population dwindled to 111 people.\n\nThe island\u2019s surviving clans clandestinely discussed their rights, pushing for\ngreater autonomy and recognition. It was not until the 1990s that Chile\nimplemented the Indigenous Law, making it the state\u2019s duty to respect,\nprotect, and promote Indigenous rights and their lands.\n\nThe Rapa Nui Indigenous culture is inherently tied to sport and competition.\nWhile European colonizers opted for oppression, war, and slaughter to enforce\npower, the Rapa Nui clans used tournaments and challenges to determine pre-\ncolonial governance. The Tangata Manu, the \u201cBirdman\u201d cult, was an annual event\nthat determined the governance of the island, which historians estimate date\nfrom the early 18th century up to colonization in the 19th century.\n\nLocal organizers swapped out imported sports like volleyball for more\ntraditional ones involving bananas. Rapa Nui Municipality\n\n\u201cI wanted to revive the Tangata Manu competition,\u201d says Rodrigo Paoa Atamu,\nthe man behind the conception of the first triathlon in the 1990s. \u201cI wanted\nto simulate what (our ancestors) did.\u201d Paoa Atuma is an author and expert on\nRapa Nui\u2019s ancestral sports and traditions. His work was crucial in bringing\nthe Tau\u2019a Rapa Nui, alongside other activities like fishing and banana-tree-\ntrunk throwing, as a central activity in the Tapati festivals.\n\n\u201cTapati was made to reconstruct our ancestral culture, from food to dance,\u201d\nsays Paoa Atuma. He explains that Tapati was initially characterized by\nimported elements from continental Chile, \u201cthat had nothing to do with our own\nculture,\u201d including sports like basketball and volleyball. \u201cI had to change\nall these sports for ancestral ones, to create an appropriate Tapati program,\u201d\nhe says.\n\n> It was a perilous competition, with competitors succumbing to shark attacks,\n> treacherous falls, and sheer exhaustion.\n\nPaoa devised a program directly derived from Rapa Nui tradition \u201cfrom sports\nand games that were really from here on the island.\u201d His main inspiration was\nthe famed Tangata Manu, an ancestral competition where elected candidates from\ndifferent clans would race to retrieve a Sooty Tern egg from a small inlet.\nAccording to historian Cristain Moreno Pakarati, these marine birds were\nconsidered the \u201clink between the world of the living and the world of\nspirits,\u201d and were bestowed with a sacred significance by islanders.\n\nTill the mid-1800s, the Tangata Manu competitors scaled down the island\u2019s\nsteep clifftop at the Orongo starting point to reach the shore and swim in the\nopen sea to the inlet. There they\u2019d have to climb the jagged rock face to\nretrieve the egg and return to Orongo with the egg intact. The winner was\ngranted governance of the island.\n\nCompetitors in the 18th century would have to swim across the sea to the\ninlet. Francisco de Casa/Alamy\n\nIt was a perilous competition, with competitors succumbing to shark attacks,\ntreacherous falls, and sheer exhaustion.\n\nPaoa initially considered the sacred Orongo site for his revived Tau\u2019a Rapa\nNui, \u201cbut it was dangerous, with loose rocks on the cliff edge.\u201d Instead, he\nset up the triathlon on the Rano Raraku volcano crater, where competitors\nwould paddle the 1,150 feet of the lake, then run one mile with the bananas,\nbefore swimming back across the lake.\n\nYet in 2018, the Tau\u2019a Rapa Nui faced an unexpected, unbeatable contender:\nclimate change. The lake dried up, forcing the event to move to the open sea;\na move welcomed by competitors like Pomare Tepano Dreisger. A nine-time\nchampion of the women\u2019s Tau\u2019a Rapa Nui category, Tepano Dreisger is a former\nprofessional surfer who excels in the open water. \u201cMy strength is the sea, but\nmy weak point is the running,\u201d she admits.\n\nFor years, the triathlon occurred on the lake of a volacno crater, but now\ntakes place on the ocean. Universal Images Group North America\nLLC/DeAgostini/Alamy\n\nTepano Dreisger says that sporting and physical fitness is a way of life for\nthose on the island. \u201cWe Polynesians invented surf, which comes from Hawaii.\nWe traveled the world in boats,\u201d she explains. \u201c(The Tau\u2019a Rapa Nui) is a way\nto maintain these symbols, so the next generation can see the power we have by\nmoving around the world in these small vessels.\u201d\n\nWhile competitors like Tepano Dreisger and Dur\u00e1n Veri Veri are committed to\ntraining and continuing the tradition, the number of participants has\ndwindled\u2014especially since moving from the crater to the arduous open sea.\nWhile dozens used to join the race, this year, only three women and four men\nparticipated.\n\n\u201cWe need to teach the young to build boats and the authorities to start\nhosting workshops. I\u2019m here to motivate the next generation,\u201d says Dur\u00e1n Veri\nVeri, who believes the next generation needs more resources to participate.\n\u201cThey need to rent a truck to get the reeds, find time to make the boat,\nphysically prepare. It\u2019s time and money.\u201d\n\nHe proudly wears his wildflower crown, but says his victory has been\nbittersweet. \u201cI want to keep this alive,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want this to\ndisappear.\u201d\n\nCan new generations keep the traditions alive?
