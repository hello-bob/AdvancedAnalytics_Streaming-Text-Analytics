Page 1 of\n4. Add A Comment.\n\nBack when looking at the AMD Ryzen 7000 series budget server performance last\nyear, DDR5-4800 ECC UDIMMs were used with the ASRock Rack 1U4LW-B650/2L2T\nRyzen server given that's what was broadly available at the time. Since then\nthere's been more ECC UDIMMs coming to market above DDR5-4800 speeds. Recently\nI bought a pair of Kingston Server Premier 32GB 5600MT/s DDR5 ECC CL46 UDIMMs\n(KSM56E46BD8KM-32HA) and that's the focus of today's tests. For those curious\nif the faster ECC UDIMMs are worthwhile compared to the commonality of\nDDR5-4800 ECC UDIMMs, these benchmarks are for you.\n\nThe Kingston Server Premier 32GB 5600MT/s KSM56E46BD8KM-32HA ECC Unbuffered\nDIMMs have a CAS latency of 46 and rated for DDR5-5600 speeds. However, the\nAMD Ryzen 7000 series processors are only able to run the ECC UDIMMs up to\nDDR5-5200 speeds. I ended up buying the KSM56E46BD8KM-32HA for later\nupgradeability and for not being able to find any DDR5-5200 ECC UDIMMs in\nstock at the time... Micron listings for their DDR5-5200 ECC UDIMMs ended up\nbeing all out-of-stock. Kingston offers these DDR5 ECC UDIMMs also in 16GB and\n48GB varieties for those interested.\n\nFor this testing it's quite a straight-forward comparison looking at the\nDDR5-4800 vs. DDR5-5200 performance with an AMD Ryzen 9 7900 processor running\nwith the ASRock Rack 1U4LW-B650/2L2T 1U server platform. The ASRock Rack\n1U4LW-B650/2L2T with B650D4U-2L2T motherboard continues working quite well as\nan AMD Ryzen 7000 series server motherboard and hasn't had any issues with\nthese 2 x 32GB KSM56E46BD8KM-32HA UDIMMs or the dual Micron\nMTC20C2085S1EC48BA1 32GB DDR5-4800 memory originally bought for this platform.\nMemory timings were at their default programmed values.\n\nThese benchmarks were carried out on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with the Linux 6.8\nkernel. Again these performance benchmarks are primarily intended for\ninformation purposes for those deciding whether to go for DDR5-4800 ECC UDIMMs\ngiven their commonality and more robust availability versus DDR5-5200 (or\nDDR5-5600) ECC UDIMs for better performance and at a slight performance\nbenefit but as of writing seem to still have limited availability from various\nInternet retailers.\n\nAdd A Comment - Next Page\n\nPage: 1 2 3 4 Next Page\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 7900X Performance With ECC DDR5 Memory\n\nCorsair 2 x 24GB DDR5-7000 Memory Linux Performance\n\nCrucial 2 x 16GB DDR5-5200 / DDR5-5600\n\nDDR5 Memory Channel Scaling Performance With AMD EPYC 9004 Series\n\nAMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 5965WX Memory Scaling Benchmarks On Linux\n\nPNY XLR8 Gaming REV 2x8GB DDR4-3600 Memory\n\nLatest Linux News\n\nAlmaLinux 9.4 Released With Support For Hardware Deprecated By RHEL\n\nPowerPC 40x Processor Support To Be Dropped From The Linux Kernel\n\nFedora Cleared To Build Python Package With \"-O3\" Optimizations\n\nFramework Laptop EC Driver Being Prepared For Linux\n\nGIMP 2.10.38 Released As What Might Be The Last Of GIMP 2\n\nLinux 6.9-rc7 Released: The Kernel Is Looking Good\n\nNew Intel P-State Linux Driver Patches To Better Handle Hybrid Core CPUs\n\nSynaptics Releases DisplayLink 6.0 USB Graphics Driver Package For Linux\n\nGNOME Shell's Layout Being Improved For Smaller Displays\n\nValve Working On Explicit Sync Support For \"NVK\" NVIDIA Vulkan Driver\n\nShow Your Support, Go Premium\n\nPhoronix Premium allows ad-free access to the site, multi-page articles on a\nsingle page, and other features while supporting this site's continued\noperations.\n\nLatest Featured Articles\n\nECC DDR5-4800 vs. DDR5-5200 Memory Performance For AMD Ryzen Zen 4\n\nPop!_OS With Linux 6.8 Is Benefiting Older System76 Threadripper Systems Too\n\nIntel Baseline Profile Yields Odd Power/Performance On Linux\n\nNoctua NH-L12Sx77 Makes For A Great Low-Profile CPU Cooler\n\nIntel Core Ultra \"Meteor Lake\" Performance Improves With Linux 6.9\n\nSupport Phoronix\n\nThe mission at Phoronix since 2004 has centered around enriching the Linux\nhardware experience.
