The term refers to the process of making very quick\ninferences about the state, characteristics or details of an individual or\nsituation with minimal amounts of information. Research has found that brief\njudgments based on thin-slicing are similar to those judgments based on much\nmore information. Judgments based on thin-slicing can be as accurate, or even\nmore so, than judgments based on much more information.\n\nThe first recorded use of the term was in 1992 by Nalini Ambady and Robert\nRosenthal in a meta-analysis in the Psychological Bulletin.^[1] Since then,\nthin-slicing has been applied to many domains, and has been used to make\nvarious types of judgments. A non-exhaustive list of domains includes\ninterpersonal relationship, clinical studies, education, etc.\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\nThin slices of the behavioral stream contain important diagnostic and\npredictive social psychological information. Because thin-slice perception and\njudgment is sufficiently effective, people's interpersonal perceptions can\noccur immediately, automatically, and to some extent validly before much can\nbe communicated verbally or through actions and events. Given the limited\nconditions under which social inference and correction occur, these initial\njudgments may determine people's ultimate perceptions, evaluations, and\ntheories about those with whom they interact face-to-face.^[2]\n\nMany studies have shown that brief observations can be used to assess outcomes\nat levels higher than expected by chance. Once comparing these observations of\nless than five minutes to those greater than five minutes, the data show no\nsignificant change, thus implying that observations made within the first few\nminutes are unchanging. An example of this can be seen in an Ambady and\nRosenthal experiment in 1993,^[3] in which they assessed the effect of thin\nslicing with 2-, 5-, and 10-second clips of non-verbal behaviors of teachers\nand the viewers' ratings of those teachers afterwards. Impressions formed\nafter viewing thin slices of behavior are considered accurate if they match\nimpressions formed after a more detailed observation of the subject and if\nthey match the impressions formed by other raters.^[4] While people are often\nnot able to report the factors that influence their judgments, researchers\nidentify types of information in brief slices of behavior that are responsible\nfor accurate judgments. Types of information include visual and verbal\ninformation. More specifically, researchers look at how people make judgments\nbased on their observations of others' minor traits such as eye contact,\nfidgeting, open-handed gestures, stiff posture, smiling, etc. Behaviors such\nas frowning, fidgeting, and gazing down had poor ratings for traits describing\nthe teacher's confidence, warmth and optimism while teachers with positive\nratings for these traits smiled more, were more likely to walk around and\ntouch their upper torsos.^[3]\n\nAmbady and Rosenthal ultimately found that those who rated the teachers after\nbeing subjected to thin slicing produced ratings that were very similar to\nthose who rated the teachers after having substantial interactions with\nthem.^[3] Additionally, the accuracy of these ratings was not significantly\ndifferent among those who saw the 2-, 5- and 10-second clips. This\ndemonstrates the impressive amount of information that is conveyed in thin\nslices of everyday behavior and the insight that it can provide about an\nindividual's personality, no matter how briefly the behavior is observed.\n\n## Domains[edit]\n\nPeople would expect that thin slices of themselves only reveal socially valued\ncharacteristics. Otherwise, they would be more willing to reveal minor\nimperfections about themselves before others make inferences based on their\nobservations. Nonetheless, both desirable and undesirable characteristics are\nusually visible through the peephole of thin slices. Thin slices of\nindividuals' behaviors could expose characteristics of their personality,\ninternal states, sexuality, relationship, biases, etc. Even individuals'\nfuture behaviors could be predicted with reasonable accuracy through thin\nslicing.^[5]\n\n### Interpersonal relationship[edit]\n\n#### First impression[edit]\n\nIn the research paper published in 2007^[6] by Dana R. Carney et al., it was\ndiscovered that increased exposure time, i.e. length of the slice, helped\npeople to obtain more information, so that they could better judge social\napproach and positive affect. The same increased length of the slice was less\nrelated to judging threats and negative affect. The accuracy of the judgement\nbased on a five-second long slice is significantly lower than the accuracy of\njudgments based on longer exposures. Also, slices extracted from the later\nstage of the interaction potentially allowed people to make more accurate\njudgments. Dana R. Carney et al. also drew the conclusion that women tended to\nmake more accurate judgments using thin slicing than did men.\n\n#### Speed dating[edit]\n\nMarian L. Houser et al. built on Deyo & Deyo's earlier work^[7] and studied\nthin slicing in speed dating.^[8] They found out that a few moments of\ncommunication evaluation in Speed dating indeed helped the participants to\npredict outcomes and make speculated assessments of their relationship with\nthe potential mate. Female speed daters noted male negative characteristics\nrather quickly, and were generally more critical. This could mean that males\nwere more open-minded or at least slower to identify the negative\ncharacteristics, meaning that they were less reactive in comparison to females\nwhen doing thin slicing. While both sexes were equally good in making positive\nevaluations about their partners, females made more specific descriptions than\nmales, and males might engage in observing the superficial if they only\nnoticed negative characteristics in the beginning of the date. Still, the\noverall result showed that speed dating did make the participants look more\nfavorable in each other's eyes.\n\n#### Social media profiles[edit]\n\nThin-slicing is a phenomenon that can occur virtually as well through contact\nwith an individual's online profile. Online profiles are essentially made up\nof several different condensed sections that reveal different aspects of a\nperson's life and interests. Microsoft researchers Kristin Stecher and Scott\nCounts investigated this domain of thin-slicing to determine exactly how much\ninformation was needed on the online profiles for viewers to form an accurate\nimpression of the individual and which profile fields contribute most to the\nability to form that impression. They focused on two forms of social media\ndomains: general social networking sites such as Facebook and Friendster, and\nblogging sites. The predictiveness of an attribute was defined as its ability\nto contribute to a viewer's ability to form a predictive impression of the\nsubject. For social media sites, information such as the individual's photo,\nname, status, high school and gender allowed raters to form predictive\nimpressions while for blogging sites, this predictive information included the\nindividual's photo, religious views, current town, employer and number of\ngroups. Thus, while users can use thin slices of information gathered from\nthese online profiles to form an impression of the subject, the impression is\nseverely impacted by the type of attributes that are presented on the profile\nas well as the different ways they are processed based on user goals.^[4]\n\n#### Sexual orientation[edit]\n\nIn 1999, Nalini Ambady et al. studied the accuracy of judgments of sexual\norientation from thin slices of behavior.^[9] After taking variables such as\nthe gender and sexual orientation of the judges and the gender of the targets\ninto consideration, Ambady reached the conclusion that people could accurately\nperceive sexual orientation through thin slicing. Approximately 55% of the\njudgments based on still photo slices were accurate, and approximately 70% of\nthe judgments based on 10 second silent video slices were accurate. Such\nperception and judgment would be more accurate if the materials provided were\nof dynamic nonverbal nature (e.g.: silent videos containing much gestural\ninformation) rather than of static information nature (e.g.: still\nphotographs). Also in her studies, gay men and lesbians were generally more\naccurate than heterosexuals in making judgments.\n\n### Clinical[edit]\n\n#### Cognitive ability[edit]\n\nAn individual's mood has been known to distort cognitive abilities. Emotions\ncloud rational quick thoughts. The three most influential studies were\nconducted in 2002 by Nalini Ambady and Heather M. Gray.^[10] In the first\nstudy, induced sadness led to reduced accuracy in judgments of teacher\neffectiveness from brief samples of nonverbal behavior. In the second study,\nsad participants showed reduced accuracy in judging relationship type from\nthin-slices as well as diminished judgmental efficiency. The third study\nshowed the possibility that sadness impairs accuracy by promoting a more\ndeliberative information-processing style. All of these studies have the basic\nprinciple that emotions do in fact affect judgement as seen through effects on\nthin-slicing.^[10] They disprove conclusions from some previous studies that\nsadness would lead to more cautious processing strategy or would not have a\nstrong effect in social perception,^[11] and argue that short-term induced\nsadness would hinder individual's social interpretation skills.\n\n#### Personality disorder[edit]\n\nJacqueline N.W. Friedman et al. (2007) examined people's ability to detect\npersonality disorder using a thin-slicing approach.^[12] They found that\npeople were capable of detecting pathological personality traits in 30 seconds\nof videotaped behavior. By looking at the \"thin slices\" of videos, research\nparticipants were able to accurately identify targets with personality\npathology from the video. Also, when participants were exposed to an increased\nnumber of personality traits, i.e.: increasing spectrum instead of \"thickness\"\nof the slices, they performed better at identifying targets' negative traits.\nThis correlation between \"thin slices\" with richer content and participants'\nbetter performance in detecting personality disorder is found to be stronger\nthan correlations found in other studies using thin slice methodology.\n\n#### Deception detection[edit]\n\nAlbrechsten, Meissner and Susa (2009) of the University of Texas at El Paso\nconducted two separate studies of processing style (intuitive vs. deliberative\nprocessing) in a deception detection task. In the first experiment, a thin-\nslicing manipulation was used to show that intuitive processing can lead to\nmore accurate judgments of deception when compared with traditional forms of\nprocessing, i.e.: forms that take in much more information input. In the\nsecond experiment, participants who engaged in a second task performed more\naccurately in a deception task than participants who were asked to provide a\nverbal rationale for each decision. The results converged to suggest that\nintuitive processing can significantly improve deception detection\nperformances.^[13]\n\n### Educational[edit]\n\n#### Parenting[edit]\n\nOne of the first series conducted by James Bugental and his colleagues showed\nthat parents' expectancies, identified from brief clips of their tone, are\nrelated to their children's behavior process. The tone of a mother with a\nnormal child and one whose child has behavioral problems differed\nsignificantly. A quick observation of parents of normal children and parents\nof children with behavioral problem can easily help the observer to\ndistinguish the two types. The conceptions above provide an underlying basis\nthat there actually is an ability to judge from brief observations. Research\nin classrooms has shown that judges can distinguish biased teachers and their\nexpectations for students from unbiased teachers and their expectations simply\nfrom brief clips of teachers' behaviors. Likewise, research in the courtroom\nhas shown that in brief excerpts of judges' instructions to jurors in trials,\nraters could predict the judge's expectations for the trial.^[14]\n\n### Examples in everyday life[edit]\n\nSome people believe that the effects of the phenomenon known as d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu happen\nwithin the same time frame of thin-slicing and might also have a direct\ncorrelation. A narrow window of experience is enough for an individual to feel\nsure that they have already witnessed or experienced a current situation, even\nthough the exact circumstances of the prior encounter are uncertain and were\nperhaps imagined.\n\nMany other uses of thin-slicing are implied by media reports such as firemen\nmaking split-second decisions, or cops knowing something is wrong by simply a\ngut feeling. All these suggest anecdotally that thin-slicing occurs\nregularly.^[15]\n\n## Explanations regarding thin-slicing accuracy[edit]\n\nThere are several proposed explanations regarding the accuracy of judgments\nmade from thin slices of behavior.\n\nThe first explanation draws from psychologists Zebrowitz-McArthur and Baron's\necological approach to Social perception,^[16] which states that attributes\ncorresponding to an unpleasant or threatening presence can be easily and\nquickly recognized because the ability to sense danger is essential for\nsurvival and adaptive action. Thus, traits such as anger and dominance are\ngenerally more easily identifiable compared to humor or responsibility.\n\nThe second explanation involves the role that stereotypes play in the initial\nstages of forming a judgment about someone. Preliminary opinions generated via\nthin-slicing are often influenced by the stereotypes a person holds, and these\nstereotypes often hold a certain, small amount of truth. For example, Berry\nand McArthur found that adults with baby faces are generally perceived to be\nmore honest, naive and kind.^[17] There is also evidence that physical and\nbiological differences are linked with differences in temperament. Shyer and\nmore reserved adult men tend to have more lightly colored eyes and a leaner,\nmore delicate build compared to men who are more social and dominant.\n^[citation needed] However, stereotypes may not always be as accurate as they\nseem because they can be propagated by a cycle of self-fulfilling prophecies\nin which our behavior is dictated by the expectations we hold of someone based\non the stereotypes they fit to. This in turn causes the target individual to\nmodify their own behavior to confirm those expectations and gives the illusion\nthat the person's traits accurately fits the stereotype from the beginning.\nFor example, physically attractive individuals may become more socially-\nskilled and confident simply because they internalize the beliefs held by\nothers that they are more socially desirable and outgoing.^[1]\n\nThe third explanation proposes that thin-slicing provides accurate judgments\nsimply because they are snap judgments.^[1] Being exposed to only a thin-slice\nof behavior eliminates the presence of distracting stimuli such as verbal\ninteraction and doesn't allow the rater time to introspectively reason out why\nthey judge an individual a certain way, which may cause them to overthink and\nchange the judgments formed by their initial instincts. Thin-slicing allows\nraters to focus on expressive behavior and weeds out extraneous information\nthat can cause judgments to stray away from the truth.\n\nNone of these explanations are believed to universally encompass the true\nreason of why thin-slicing is successful. Instead, it is likely that they are\nnot mutually exclusive and each influence thin-slicing accuracy to a certain\ndegree.^[1]\n\n## Variation in thin-slicing factors[edit]\n\n### Exposure time[edit]\n\nAmbady and Rosenthal's 1992 meta-analysis revealed that a longer exposure time\nof a thin-slice does not significantly improve accuracy of judgment.^[1]\n\n### Channels of communication[edit]\n\nThin-slices of behavior include two main channels of communication: non-verbal\nand verbal. Non-verbal behavior is defined as facial and body expressions or\ntone of voice. Verbal behavior involves actual speech. When dealing with\nverbal and nonverbal cues that provide inconsistent conclusions, assessing the\nnonverbal behaviors generally provides the more accurate judgment. This is\nbecause humans can easily control what they say to present themselves in a\nparticular light or provide a certain impression of a situation but have a\nmore difficult time trying to control their facial and body expression and\ntone of voice.^[1] For example, judges were found to reveal their true\nexpectations of whether or not a defendant was guilty through their nonverbal\nbehavior but not their verbal behavior.^[18] However, Ambady and Rosenthal's\nmeta-analysis revealed that while judgments were more accurate when observing\nonly facial and body expressions as opposed to facial and body expressions in\naddition to speech, the difference in accuracy is not significant enough to\nactually declare that using different channels of communication will affect\nthe accuracy of a result.^[1]\n\n### Physical attractiveness[edit]\n\nIn Ambady and Rosenthal's 1993 experiment, they use 2, 5 and 10 second video\nclips of non-verbal behavior of teachers to test the accuracy of the judgments\nmade by raters who watched those videos. While physical attractiveness of the\nvideo subject may seem like an obvious bias that may lead people to form\ninaccurate judgments, they demonstrated that it actually did not have a strong\neffect on their experimental outcome. One reason may be due to differences in\nthe \"type\" of thin slice that is being made available to the raters. For\nexample, when simply given a photo of an individual, a rater tends to judge\npersonality traits simply based on attractiveness. However, when expressive\nbehavior is available such as through the video clips used in the experiment,\nphysical attractiveness becomes less important and less utilized when forming\nan impression of someone.^[3]\n\n## Practical implications[edit]\n\nWhile thin-slicing has been proven to be a powerful experimental tool, it is\nimportant that experiments are being designed such that thin-slicing can\nactually be used to accurately judge the behavior of interest because it is\nnot appropriate to use thin-slicing to universally evaluate different\nsituations. First, the behaviors or traits in question should be easily\nobservable so that ratings based on thin-slicing can be used reliably. Second,\nthese traits should generally have an affective or interpersonally, rather\nthan personally-oriented component because the latter is much more difficult\nto judge and less observable. Interpersonal dimensions include dominance and\nshyness while personal dimensions include conscientiousness and\nintelligence.^[1]\n\nThe proven accuracy and effects of thin-slicing has several practical\nimplications. First, experimenters can reliably use thin-slicing to evaluate\ndifferent affect variables and can thus save time and money on gathering\nextraneous information. Additionally, since thin-slicing can be used to\naccurately predict interpersonally-oriented qualities, they can be used in the\nselection, training and evaluation of individuals who require strong\ninterpersonal skills, such as teachers, managers and therapists. Finally,\nsince channels of communication do not significantly influence accuracy,\nratings can be gathered from any of the channels that are conveniently\navailable.^[1]\n\n## Popular culture[edit]\n\n### Blink[edit]\n\nOne of the most popular books on thin-slicing is Blink: The Power of Thinking\nWithout Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell. In this book, the author describes\ninteresting examples and research which exploit the idea of thin-slicing.\n\nFor example, Gladwell describes how a museum acquired an ancient sculpture,\nbrought to the J. Paul Getty Museum in California, under the name Getty\nkouros. Some art experts observed the sculpture and decided there was\nsomething wrong with it, a gut feeling due to the artwork exhibiting all the\nwrong signs. However, under thorough investigation the sculpture was deemed\nreal because of a lack of solid evidence to the contrary. The statue's\nauthenticity was later thrown into question due to erroneous assumptions made\nby one of the researchers who had previously vouched for it.\n\nAnother example in this book explored the work of John Gottman, a well-known\nmarital expert. Gladwell describes how within an hour of observing a couple,\nGottman can gather with 95% accuracy if the couple will be together within 15\nyears. Gottman's accuracy goes down to 90% if he observes the couples for 15\nminutes, supporting the phenomenon of thin-slicing. However, the strength of\nthe evidence supporting these claims has been criticized. ^[19]\n\n### 12 Angry Men[edit]\n\nThe drama has a few adaptations, including the earliest 1954 teleplay, a 1957\nmovie and a 1997 remake movie. The movies themselves did not explicitly\ndiscuss thin-slicing, but depicted various types of group behaviors and group\ninteractions. Those depictions made the movie a popular choice for teaching\nand illustrating group processes.^[16]\n\nThere are now numerous websites^[17] containing essays and articles that\nanalyze aspects of group dynamics shown in the movie, using methods analogous\nto thin-slicing. Also, students learning group dynamics, social psychology and\nrelated topics are usually required to analyze the movie using the thin-\nslicing method. All these analyses strongly correlate the movie to the method\nof thin-slicing.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Psychology portal\n\n  * First impression\n  * Illusory correlation\n  * Intertrial priming\n  * Priming\n  * Stereotype threat\n  * Zero-acquaintance personality judgments\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d ^e ^f ^g ^h ^i Ambady, Nalini; Rosenthal, Robert (March 1992). \"Thin slices of expressive behavior as predictors of interpersonal consequences: A meta-analysis\".
