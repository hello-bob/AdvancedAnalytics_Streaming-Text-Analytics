It\nincludes fixes for the resizable widget when a global box-sizing: border-box\nCSS declaration is present (a common complaint was about resizable dialogs),\nsupport for the hidden attribute in selectmenu options, fixes for the\ndeprecated -ms-filter syntax, and correcting the format of the deprecated\nui/core.js AMD module.\n\njQuery UI has a new test runner ported from jQuery that allows local &\nBrowserStack test runs without reliance on Karma. As an added bonus, we\u2019re now\nrunning tests against Chrome, Firefox, Safari & Edge against latest jQuery\n1.x, 2.x, 3.x & the development version in GitHub CI, allowing to detect more\nissues at the pull request level. This will also be a basis for a future\njQuery UI 1.14 \u2013 but that\u2019s a topic for a separate blog post.\n\nPlease remember jQuery UI is in a maintenance state: we\u2019ll make sure the\nlibrary is compatible with new jQuery releases and that security issues are\nfixed but no new significant feature work is planned. We\u2019ll also try to fix\nimportant regressions from jQuery UI 1.12.1; older long-standing bugs may not\nget fixed. Note that this does not affect jQuery Core which is still actively\nmaintained.\n\n### Download\n\n#### File Downloads\n\n  * Development Bundle: https://jqueryui.com/resources/download/jquery-ui-1.13.3.zip\n  * Themes Package: https://jqueryui.com/resources/download/jquery-ui-themes-1.13.3.zip\n\n#### Git (contains source files, with @VERSION replaced with 1.13.3, base\ntheme only)\n\n  * Tag: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/1.13.3\n\n#### Install via npm\n\n  * npm install jquery-ui@1.13.3\n\n#### Install via bower\n\n  * bower install jquery/jquery-ui#1.13.3\n\njQuery CDN\n\n  * Uncompressed: https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.13.3/jquery-ui.js\n  * Compressed: https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.13.3/jquery-ui.min.js\n  * Themes: black-tie, blitzer, cupertino, dark-hive, dot-luv, eggplant, excite-bike, flick, hot-sneaks, humanity, le-frog, mint-choc, overcast, pepper-grinder, redmond, smoothness, south-street, start, sunny, swanky-purse, trontastic, ui-darkness, ui-lightness, and vader.\n\n#### Google Ajax Libraries API (CDN)\n\n  * Uncompressed: https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.13.3/jquery-ui.js\n  * Compressed: https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.13.3/jquery-ui.min.js\n  * Themes: black-tie, blitzer, cupertino, dark-hive, dot-luv, eggplant, excite-bike, flick, hot-sneaks, humanity, le-frog, mint-choc, overcast, pepper-grinder, redmond, smoothness, south-street, start, sunny, swanky-purse, trontastic, ui-darkness, ui-lightness, and vader.\n\n#### Microsoft Ajax CDN (CDN)\n\n  * Uncompressed: https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.ui/1.13.3/jquery-ui.js\n  * Compressed: https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.ui/1.13.3/jquery-ui.min.js\n  * Themes: black-tie, blitzer, cupertino, dark-hive, dot-luv, eggplant, excite-bike, flick, hot-sneaks, humanity, le-frog, mint-choc, overcast, pepper-grinder, redmond, smoothness, south-street, start, sunny, swanky-purse, trontastic, ui-darkness, ui-lightness, and vader.\n\n#### Custom Download Builder\n\n### Changelog\n\nSee the 1.13 Upgrade Guide for a list of changes that may affect you when\nupgrading from 1.12.x.
