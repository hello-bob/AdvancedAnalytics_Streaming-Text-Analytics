Lots of Wasm, Pydantic on fire, and Guido in a\ncrossword...\n\nwww.bitecode.dev\n\n1\n\nShare\n\n##\n\nSummary\n\n  * Cloudflare workers now support Python through pyodide\n\n  * Wasmer releases a Python to Wasm compiler, 3 times faster than alternatives\n\n  * Pydantic's author reveals his new observability service with deep Python integration\n\n  * The Python community not affected by XZ so far\n\n  * Guido is 5 letters, 41 accross\n\n##\n\nCloudflare Python workers\n\nAfter two decades spent in the Python world, I kinda usually see where things\nare heading. But boy, didn't I see this one coming.\n\nCloudflare, the giant service that caches and offers DDOS protection for half\nthe web, released a version of its workers service for Python.\n\nCloudflare workers are a so-called serverless edge cloud computing platform.\nAnd if this soup of buzz words triggered your BS bingo frenzy, you are not\nalone.\n\nTranslation: they host your code and manage transparently the server, while\nreplicating and load balancing the service automatically. This means\ntheoretically that your code executes closer to the user because Cloudflare is\neverywhere, with potentially lower latency, while you pay only for what you\nuse.\n\nThis also means you are locked in a proprietary platform and rely on their\nother external services for data persistence, as \"server less\" implies your\nendpoints are stateless.\n\nStill, this is good news. The JS workers were quite popular because the free\nplan comes with 100 000 requests per day, provided each one runs in less than\n10 ms.\n\nIt's not bad if you want to play with an idea or deploy a PoC but don't want\nto go full hosting yet. It's especially nice since it can make requests to the\ninternet, and run Cron jobs. Maybe you have a little static web site that need\njust a nudge of logic from time to time. Maybe you have a bookmarklet that\ncould benefit from a proxy to make requests.\n\nThe Python versions runs using pyodide, so expect it to be 5 times slower than\nregular Python and to not have access to all the C extensions.\n\nI haven't given a try to the service yet, but it's on my todo-list.\n\n##\n\npy2wasm: A Python to Wasm compiler\n\nwasmer.io, a Saas company that aims at providing a universal app platform\nthrough web assembly, released pywasm, a Python to Wasm compiler.\n\nWhile it was already possible to do so using the aforementioned pyodide,\nwasmer takes an innovative approach by compiling first the code with the\nwonderful nuitka, which gives a performance boosts by itself, then turn the\nresult into web assembly.\n\nThe result is claimed to be three time faster than pyodide, which means it's\nonly twice slower than CPython. Not bad.\n\n##\n\nPydantic on a roll\n\nSamuel Colvin is a busy bee.\n\nThis april, he dropped the v2.7.0 of the excellent validation library\npydantic, apparently squeezing even more perfs, thanks notably to jiter, a\nfast rust based JSON parser.\n\nBut above all, he released his new observability service dedicated to Python:\npydantic logfire.\n\nBased on the OpenTelemetry standard, it features logs, traces and metrics\ncapture, either manually with logging and spanning calls, or automatically\nwith instrumentation built in for django, fast api, flask and many other\npopular modules.\n\nBe warned that using telemetry, and particularly the heavy hitter OT, is a\ntrade off: you will gain good insight to your running system, in exchange for\na performance penalty.\n\nGiven the track record of the author, that the service is free while in beta,\nand based on standard and open source components to avoid lock in, I'm going\nto give a try to this one.\n\n##\n\nThe Python community not affected by XZ so far\n\nThe FOSS world was a bit on edge last month, dealing with the fallout of the\nXZ backdoor.\n\nAs we covered previously, the PSF hired Seth Michael Larson to help with all\nthings security. Good timing. And so he did a report on the matter for our\necosystem.\n\nBottom line, despite the fact CPython bundles xz to power the lzma module, no\nversion is known to contain the malicious 5.6.0 or 5.6.1.\n\nPypi itself, running on Debian Bookworm, is not affected, and neither are the\nofficial Python Docker images.\n\nFinally, a scan was made on the service and no module distributed seems to be\ncause for alarm, although the method is not bullet proof.\n\n##\n\nGuido in the NY times crossword\n\nSure, it's useless news. But it's fun news.\n\nWarning! If you put your email in there, I will send the next articles to it.\nUse at your own risk.\n\n7 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n1 Restack\n\n7\n\nShare this post\n\n#### What's up Python?

Sentry with his APM features? Posthog?\nPrometheus to have nice charts on how many times X requests were successfully\ncalled or failed? and now Logfire. I'm a bit lost with all that options. Any\nidea on a simple stack to start with? ^^Expand full commentLikeReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nXML is the future\n\nOkay, campers, rise and shine...\n\nJun 24, 2023\n\n116\n\nShare this post\n\n#### XML is the future\n\nwww.bitecode.dev\n\n22\n\nWhat's up, Python?
