First off, some mathpalette trickery to have four\narguments:\n\n  1. the current math style, as usual\n  2. the letter to be typeset, so either \\imath and \\jmath\n  3. the (math) kern in front of the heart\n  4. the math kern after the combination, to compense for the protrusion of the heart which is not taken into account because of \\hidewidth\n\nI make a \\vbox with \\ialign inside it that oversets the heart to the letter.\n\nFinally, the heart is a bold \\heartsuit in the suitable math style subject to\nan affine transformation that applies reduction and shearing.\n\nMaybe some more experiments are needed for the various parameters.\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nedited Apr 22 at 20:07\n\nanswered Apr 22 at 9:08\n\negregegreg\n\n1.1m137137 gold badges2.6k2.6k silver badges4.3k4.3k bronze badges\n\n1\n\n  * 5\n\nThanks!
