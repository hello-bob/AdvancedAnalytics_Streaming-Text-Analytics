There resides the strength of our fight or flight instinct. We are\nconstantly challening ourselves and our skills in order to not only grow as\nindividuals, but also to transform our surroundings, for the better or the\nworse.\n\nEnvironmentally-wise, the worst has already happened. In order to fix this,\nmillions across the UK, billions across the world, are looking to change their\nlives for the greater good of mankind, as shown in the latest research from\nIndeed.\n\n## National survey and Global issue\n\nNew survey from Indeed comprising more than 1,000 workers, job seekers and 500\nemployers in the UK, highlights the ongoing green skills challenge. Despite\nthe clear appetite for sustainability-related jobs among working people, 42%\nbelieve there are still too many barriers to entry. More than a quarter have\nbeen trying to transition to the sector but have been unsuccessful so far.\n\n26% would also take a pay cut and 44% would consider retraining to enter the\nenvironmental sustainability sector.\n\n## Facing Obstacles\n\nLocation is a key barrier to applying for sustainability jobs, with 42% saying\nwhere they live significantly holds them back. Those in the West Midlands are\nmore likely to feel this, while those in the South East of England feel best\nplaced to secure a sustainability-related role with only a third saying their\nlocation is a barrier.\n\nPay is another factor deterring job seekers. 1 in 5 respondents feel that\nthere aren\u2019t enough paid positions to apply for, while 52% believe that ESG or\nsustainability roles are predominantly volunteer-based or fundraiser roles.\nEven when there are paid positions, 33% say that inadequate pay puts them off\napplying.\n\nDespite challenges with pay, just over a quarter of respondents say they would\ntake a salary cut for a job that contributes to sustainability initiatives.\nYet there are generational differences with willingness, with 42% of 18-24\nyear-olds prepared to take a pay cut, compared to only 23% of 35-44 year-olds,\nand 18% for 45-54 year-olds.\n\nEmployers and jobseekers alike are wary of greenwashing. 1 in 5 jobseekers are\nput off applying for sustainability jobs due to an employer\u2019s sustainability\ncredentials not matching claims. Equally, 1 in 5 of employers say the fear of\nbeing perceived to be greenwashing is a barrier to recruitment in this sector.\n\n## Employers vs Jobseekers\n\nThe data shows a disconnect between employers\u2019 and job seekers\u2019 perceptions\nregarding the prevalence of sustainability skills. 29% of employers say there\nis a lack of candidates with the right skills, and while 25% of workers and\njob seekers say they don\u2019t have the right qualifications (such as a scientific\ndegree) for many of the roles, 44% feel employers are not open enough to\ntransferable skills.\n\nOver a fifth of employers believe that having better support systems for\nonboarding skilled workers from other industries could effectively address the\nrecruitment challenges in sustainability-related positions. While employees\nthink sustainability education should start early: with 63% agreeing more\nshould be done to encourage young people into environmental or sustainability\njobs.\n\nRegardless of this misalignment, of the respondents currently trying to\ntransition to a sustainability role, more have been successful (32%) than\nunsuccessful (27%). However, younger applicants are finding it more difficult\nwith 35% 18-24 and 25-34 year-olds reporting their attempt to transition has\nbeen so far unsuccessful compared to only 19% of 45+ year-olds.\n\n## Promising Future\n\nThere\u2019s a promising future for ESG-related jobs as, according to ONS data,\nemployment for these roles rose 8.4% higher in 2022 than originally estimated\nin 2021. Indeed\u2019s survey was equally optimistic, with almost half (48%) of\nworking people feeling more roles will become available in environmental\nsustainability following new EU legislation dictating business metrics around\nsustainability.\n\nAlthough there are an estimated 639,400 green jobs in the UK, reflecting the\nthree-quarters (76%) of British businesses surveyed that said they have a\nsustainability department or point of contact in their organisation, almost\nhalf of the businesses that don\u2019t have a sustainability function say they\ndon\u2019t plan to set one up; more needs to be done to truly make a positive\nimpact on climate change.\n\nArticle by Paul Ferretti\n\nSHARE\n\nREPORT AN ERROR DOWNLOAD PDF / EXPORT\n\nNewsletter\n\nSign up\n\nRelated articles\n\nNews By Maddyness UK\n\n3 May 2024\n\neCommerce, accreditation and green energy in this week\u2019s MaddyMoney\n\nNews By Paul Ferretti\n\n2 May 2024\n\nFrom A to Zilch: Zilch selects Amazon Web Services to accelerate AI innovation\n\nNews By Paul Ferretti\n\n30 April 2024\n\nCreating the future: World\u2019s Top 50 Innovators 2024 Codex will take place in\nMay\n\nThank you,\n\nNewsletter\n\nno spam, pinky promise\n\nThank you,\n\nyou're all set, keep an eye on your inbox for all the latest news\n\nThank you,\n\nGet in touch\n\nMaddyness \u00a92021\n\nLegal\n\nMedia\n\n  * Articles\n  * Verticals\n  * Calendar\n\nMaddyTalent\n\n  * MaddyJobs\n  * MaddyTalent\n\nAbout\n\n  * About\n  * Contact us\n  * Submit an article\n  * Legal\n\nFR Edition MaddyPlay MaddyStudio MaddyEvent MaddyShop MaddyJobs\n\nMaddyness\n\n", "frontpage": false}
