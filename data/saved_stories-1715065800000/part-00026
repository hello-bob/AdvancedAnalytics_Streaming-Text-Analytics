The blog, based on\nthe past posts, tends to be the general public, including various\nstakeholders. It's a marketing tool. Meta SE should be focused on the\ncommunity. It may take some more work, but I'd strongly recommend drafting two\nversions of these announcements and making sure the Meta SE version doesn't\nhave business/marketing speak, but targets our concerns as active participants\nin the communities.\n\n\u2013 Thomas Owens\n\n8 hours ago\n\n  * 2\n\n@Ad\u00e1m They're probably feeding the companies data from the entire network\n\n\u2013 Zoe\n\n8 hours ago\n\n  * 3\n\nDid this partnership get delayed because of the recent (humongous) LLM abuse\ncase over on SO?

Also an explicit\nstatement that someone or some people are watching and will be addressing\nquestions (and then, of course, following through by updating the post with\nanswers to questions).

Attribution is\npretty much impossible. Attribution only really works if you use language\nmodels as \"search engine\". The moment you start generating output, the source\nis lost.\n\n\u2013 Cerbrus\n\n8 hours ago\n\n  * 4\n\n@Cerbrus Enterprise Copilot would like a word with you.

Even if it did, there's\nno guarantee that the source either has anything to do with the topic in\nquestion, nor that it states the same as the generated content. Citing stuff\nis trivial if you don't have to care if the citation is relevant to the\ncontent, or if it says the same as you.

That's\ndifferent from actually training a model to cite (e.g. use supervised\nfinetuning on citations with human raters checking whether sources match,\nwhich would also allow you to verify how accurately a model cites). This is\nsomething OpenAI could do, it just doesn't.\n\n\u2013 Erik A\n\n7 hours ago\n\n  * 5\n\n@ErikA I've seen people use models that generate citations, and they still\nmanage to incorrectly cite sources. Those models are certainly better than\nChatGPT, but they still screw up correctness of the content they cite\nregularly. Overflow AI had this very same problem while it was still running.\n\n\u2013 Zoe\n\n7 hours ago\n\n  * 24\n\nGuys, you seem to misunderstand how LLMs generate text. They don't copy text\nverbatim. They generate it word by word. When generating, LLMs don't even have\nany knowledge about their original training data. They just have the model\nthat was built from the training data. It is literally impossible for them to\nknow where the words came from, unless you actually built a separate system\njust for attribution.\n\n\u2013 Cerbrus\n\n7 hours ago\n\n  * 2\n\nIt is more likely they will use some kind of RAG i.e. search engine +\nsummarization (rather than directly training on new data). In that case,\nattribution is possible (with limited to their retrieved contents, not\nattribution of original training data).\n\n\u2013 pcpthm\n\n4 hours ago\n\n  * \"Will the users who actually spent time writing and contributing their content be attributed in any way when their content is fed into OpenAI's products?\" I don't attribute where i got my code from when i conjure it out of my brain. Maybe it was 31 years of documentation, or open-source projects, or online respositories, or textbooks from university. If a carbon-brain can't supply attribution, we will not require a silicon brain to supply any. Nor do i require attribution of any of my code contributions.\n\n\u2013 Ian Boyd\n\n3 hours ago\n\n  * I know stuff like Copilot will link back to things that it used in a web search, but yeah, I haven't heard how attribution works practically right now for stuff that goes into the training of the model (and not just its web searches after training is over). I've heard of some research stuff, but not something that has gone into the big models today.\n\n\u2013 super-starball-ultra\n\n54 mins ago\n\nAdd a comment |\n\nThis answer is useful\n\n38\n\nSave this answer.\n\nShow activity on this post.\n\nI know - viscerally - that y'all are shorthanded. I also know that things\nsometimes get dropped in your laps unexpectedly with little time to prepare,\nso I'm hoping that this was merely an oversight... but I'd have to echo\nMithical's point, particularly as link-only answers are a core concern on the\nplatform.\n\nY'all have, unfortunately, posted a link-only question, which relies on\nexternal links for all of the important content. This means you're expecting\npeople to visit two different links and read long-ish posts that aren't\nwritten for this audience to get all of the information they need to\nunderstand and respond to this post.\n\nI think we're all well aware that AI is an extremely contentious subject on\nthe network and the core community have very strong concerns about it. I\nappreciate that you link to the February blog post about socially responsible\nAI but, again, summarizing the core ideas from that post in this context\nrather than linking to it alone would have given people much more community-\ncentric context about the content in those two sources. Particularly since the\nMSE announcement of that post was similarly poorly received and few questions\nhave been answered.\n\nRight now I'm seeing a lot of concern about whether this means that y'all are\nmore likely to override the rules about posting AI-generated content on sites\nor changing your thoughts about attribution. While these points are addressed\nin the Commitment blog post, I'm going to be honest - that post is written in\na very indirect and unclear way, so I'd really appreciate a synopsis in\nsimpler words. For example:\n\n> In addition, community answers should be derived from quality, accurate,\n> sourced data.\n\nOn the surface, this is a very nice sentiment - one that we can all get\nbehind. Unfortunately, it doesn't actually say that AI-generated answers can't\nbe posted by community members, reviewed or not - if people assume AI\ngenerated content is \"quality, accurate, sourced data\" (it's not), then they\nwill think it's fine. It's also unclear what \"community answers\" means - two\nvery different interpretations are:\n\n  * Answers written by community members\n  * Answers on a Stack Exchange community site\n\nThe former leaves huge openings for AI-generated answers, since they're not\ncreated by community members and the prior (much clearer) statement about\nquestions uses \"community\" to mean \"community member\" as opposed to \"assisted\nand curated by AI\", further leading to the former interpretation.\n\nThe full statement about questions is:\n\n> questions on Stack Overflow (whether by a community member or assisted and\n> curated by AI) are posted only after human review.\n\nIs possible to say something similarly definite about answers to indicate that\nthe company commits to ensure all answers must at minimum have human review to\nensure accuracy while ensuring that sites' communities have oversight to\nfurther restrict using these tools to answer questions?\n\nIt'd be really great if, now that the post is out and you are getting feedback\nof confusion and questions from community, if you could edit a community-\nfocused explanation/overview of the two posts into the question so that a\nreader doesn't have to view the full press releases to understand what's\nhappening.\n\nTo be clear, this isn't about specifics - it's about the most general big-\npicture things. You're building on a foundation that's not clear to the users,\neven if it's obvious to you. Perhaps you find what's been written in these\nposts to be crystal clear. You know what the company intends and that the\ninterest in the community connection is genuine. The community doesn't know\nthat.\n\nYou can dismiss my statements as me looking for the negative interpretation in\neverything. I've been there. I've struggled with people trying too hard to\nread into and over-analyze every word I've written and finding cracks when I'm\ntrying to be open and honest. I know it's difficult. But that's why I spent\ntime clarifying things rather than just brushing those concerns aside.\n\nIf you can't clearly and succinctly say things like, \"We will not create or\nincorporate tools to automatically post answers using AI to the sites.\" and\n\"We will discourage users from manually posting or converting AI-generated\nanswers without human verification and review to the sites.\" - over and over\nuntil people actually start believing it, people will continue to look for\nindications that you're stating things in ways that allow you to point at your\nprior statements and say that you're not \"technically\" violating them.\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nanswered 6 hours ago\n\nCatijaCatija\n\n106k4545 gold badges291291 silver badges410410 bronze badges\n\n0\n\nAdd a comment |\n\nThis answer is useful\n\n32\n\nSave this answer.\n\nShow activity on this post.\n\nHow does this impact the previously-announced partnership with Google? It\nseems like OpenAI and Google are both getting similar things out of their\nrespective relationships, and that is access to the use of Network data for\ntraining. OpenAI also recently announced an entry into search. Can we expect\nboth OpenAI's services as well as Google Cloud AI technologies to be\nintegrated into the platform, since both announcements appear to indicate\nthis?\n\nThere was a past blog post on \"socially responsible AI\". One of the key\nelements was \"attribution is non-negotiable\". OpenAI, historically, has done a\npoor job of attributing parts of a response to the content that the response\nwas based on. Google's Gemini has some built-in capabilities for citing\ncontent with related web content, but there are still no guarantees that it\nrelates the statement to the correct source material or that attribution meets\nthe CC BY-SA requirements for attribution. Given the company's stance on the\nneed for attribution and OpenAI's past problems in that space, why this\npartnership? When can we expect to see more details about how OpenAI is\nsolving the attribution problem?\n\nAre we going to continue to see AI services blocked if they do not sign a\npartnership, especially with no public announcement?

This makes a unique selling point for ChatGPT, where basically another company is profiting off of the contributors works. Apart from that, there needs to be a consideration of why the knowledge was given. SE thrives from people providing knowledge for free.
