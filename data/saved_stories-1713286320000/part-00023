When the motor is started, the\ntransmission device drives the chain to run, and the chain plates are\ncyclically transported along the track of the equipment. Materials such as\nwaste paper bundles or pulp boards are placed on the chain plate. With the\nmovement of the chain, the materials are smoothly transported to the\ndestination.\n\n### Advantages of Chain Converyor\n\n1\\. The Chain Converyor uses a chain as a transmission device, which has high\ntransmission efficiency and stable operation, and can reduce energy\nconsumption while ensuring the transportation of materials. 2. The Chain\nConveryor can be installed horizontally or tilted according to the actual\nsituation of the factory. It has a wide range of applications and can meet the\ntransportation needs of different scenarios.\n\nAre you interested in waste paper recycling or paper making projects?
