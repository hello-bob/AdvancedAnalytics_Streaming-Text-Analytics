It offers concrete reasons,\nin the very sense of the aforementioned Memorandum, to demonstrate the\nnecessity of adopting such a document. It is important to note, however, that\nthis document is not exhaustive and is limited mostly to the recent past.\n\nReflecting on events over the last few months, including Srid's ban in\nNovember 2023, this RFC must also be viewed in light of very recent and\nongoing controversies. During the second Anduril sponsorship controversy in\nearly 2024, it became clear to us that a certain subsection of the community\nis heavily leaning into what might be termed the myth of marginalization as a\nstrategic device to gain special powers over others.\n\nSimultaneously, this group, still upset about the failure of RFC 98, is using\nthe myth of fascism combined with an abusive extension of the paradox of\ntolerance (originally formulated by Karl Popper with a very different intent)\nto portray their opponents as bad-faith actors, or even as outright evil. They\nthemselves, of course, do everything they can to appear justified in\nexercising power with absolutely no accountability, and with a clear sense of\ntheir own privileged entitlement to do so.^1\n\nIn the most recent twist of events, a group of people has rallied behind an\nanonymously redacted document and has started to target Eelco Dolstra, the\nfounder of the entire Nix project. Note that Irene Knapp, the main author of\nthe failed RFC 98, is among the signatories of this document:\n\nhttps://save-nix-together.org/\n\nThe current moderation team heavily supports this latest move. As we can\nclearly see here, contributor Hexa, himself a member of the Nix community\nmoderation team at the time of this writing, is promoting the message to the\npublic by posting it on lobste.rs:\n\nhttps://lobste.rs/s/0qvtim/open_letter_nixos_foundation mirror\n\nPlease note again that Irene Knapp, the main author of the failed RFC 98, is\npart of the moderation team on lobste.rs at the time of this writing:\nhttps://lobste.rs/~Irene\n\nEelco Dolstra is being depicted as an irresponsible project leader who must be\nousted for \"the community\" to take over the project. But who exactly is \"the\ncommunity,\" and who speaks for them? In a recent discussion regarding the\nfinding on GitHub, a user addressed what he perceived as \"a de-facto power\ngrab\" by the moderation team concerning deciding sponsorship policy for Nix-\nrelated events:\n\nNixOS/foundation#128 (comment) screen\n\nWe are now witnessing a much larger de facto power grab, all out in the open,\nand again related to moderation. We are deeply concerned by this unabashed\nattempt to transform the existing open community into an ideological\nplayground for an extremely intolerant far-left identitarian ideology. The\nmoderation team is central to all of this, as it seems to enact and protect\ntheir intolerance. This is endangering all moderate and decent people who want\nto share in the benefits that the Nix ecosystem has to offer.\n\nThe authors of the anonymous document are clearly aware of the nature of their\nown attempt. At the end of a section of their document, shrouded in the\nlanguage of \"empathy,\" they ask for preemptive censorship of any criticisms:\n\n> Finally, we acknowledge that any changes in Eelco\u2019s role, even if prompted\n> by clear misconduct, are going to be interpreted as a bunch of left-wing\n> people taking over the project. Although the authors\u2019 politics are left-\n> leaning, this is not about Eelco\u2019s political views, it is about his actions,\n> how they have shaped the Nix project culturally, and how his actions do not\n> serve the project\u2019s interests. We realize how this interpretation will lead\n> to significant moderation load due to the out-of-community brigading\n> activities of certain banned community members, as well as internal\n> community debate. We would ask the Foundation to make a clear statement that\n> this is unacceptable behavior when they take action.**\n\nNevermind the hypocrisy of accusing others of brigading while practicing the\nsame tactic for years on end, and to great effect; as any far-leftist\nidentitarian would acknowledge: tech is political, and so is culture.\nTherefore, to them, this is necessarily all and primarily about politics, and\nin that sense, all their (rather extreme) actions are justified in their own\neyes, and on their own authority. Everybody knows, by now, that an\nidentitarian left-leaning person does not believe in political neutrality! In\nfact, they have made that clear themselves on a number of occasions.\nTherefore, The denial of this must be taken to be a strategic diversion. And\nwe can clearly see here, while internal debate is unacceptable because it\nraises the moderation load, the moderation team member Hexa himself is posting\nthe controversial letter publicly, raising the stakes, creating more incentive\nfor such divisive debate. A debate they are subsequently willing to use to\nlegitimize more power being assigned to them for the sake of keeping the\ncommunity \"safe\". The very agents of division are complaining about the\ndivision they themselves create.\n\nPlease take a moment to appreciate the surrealist absurdity of all this:\n\n  1. In the recent discussion on sponsorship policies, someone calls out an ongoing power grab on GitHub NixOS/foundation#128 (comment) screen\n  2. NixOS foundation board observer RaitoBezarius denying on GitHub that there is a power grab, speaking of \"power grab fantasies.\" NixOS/foundation#128 (comment) screen\n  3. Days later, the same RaitoBezarius boosting a post on Mastodon where someone else says: all the fascists will get kicked out https://hachyderm.io/@leftpaddotpy/112248186696362113 screen\n  4. The author of this post leaning into the myth of fascism for exclusionary purposes counts on moderation team member piegames to enact such left-leaning identitarian policies inside the Nix community: \"please talk to piegames, they're very involved in making this happen and it will help our future advocacy for better board composition\" (Targeting the foundation board members, the most important of which is Eelco Dolstra) https://hachyderm.io/@leftpaddotpy/112248495631909404\n  5. The appearance of an open letter calling for the ousting and expropriation of the project founder from his life's work, saying that \"Eelco should resign from all of his formal roles in the project and take at least a 6 months break from involvement at all, to allow the community ownership of the project to get on its feet in practice.\" https://save-nix-together.org/\n  6. The moderation team member Hexa posts the letter publicly, while the authors of the letter want to repress criticism of their power grab preemptively because it might increase \"moderation load.\" https://lobste.rs/s/0qvtim/open_letter_nixos_foundation mirror\n  7. Most likely we are going to see complaints about concern trolls and similar things in the future, when people start to make critical remarks, with people on certain Mastodon instances complaining about fascists and what not. All the while telling others how tired they are and how they want their time to be respected.\n\nThis cycle of the theater of the absurd needs to end. The friends of the\ninfernal identitarian game need to be tamed. Actual moderation - the virtue of\nmoderation - needs to replace identitarian division.\n\nIn all this, the moderation team plays a crucial role, as we can already see.\nIts reform is therefore the most important step. Without its power being so\nblatantly abused for political gain at this point, none of this would have\nbeen possible. They will deny it, of course, or deflect as they have done on\nnumerous occasions, which is why we are left, reluctantly, with no choice but\nto compile this document of proof.\n\nIn any case, the moderation team being the only institution that has the power\nto decide who does and does not belong to \"the community\", it appears\nimperative to us that it should be prevented from leaning into identitarian\nexclusionary ideologies - as it has sadly been doing increasingly in recent\nmonths.\n\nWhile the failed RFC 98 already tried to use the myth of fascism as an\nexclusionary device against moderate voices all out in the open, we can see\nthe same machinations now operating in a more piecemeal fashion, and in a more\nsecretive way, trying to harm the project at its core.\n\nWhat this means to contributors not aligned with this identitarian closure's\nstrict political evaluation scheme (it is sadly very eager and not lazy at\nall) can be seen from the examples collected below: to us, it looks very much\nlike personal defamation, intimidation, and exclusion.\n\nWe are fully aware that because this account of the recent past relies on our\nunique experiences, each of the reasons we present here can be disputed on\nvarious grounds. However, we believe this presentation of how things have\nappeared to us to be worthwhile to be seen by the eyes of others.\n\nMay all discern for themselves.\n\nThe freedom of discernment shall never be sacrificed.\n\n### 1) Current moderation culture is not equitable in that it does not abide\nby reasons accessible or explicable to all\n\n#### 1.1 There are no discernible general reasons guiding moderation\ndecisions. tldr: it's a giant mess\n\nIt appears to us that there is no transparent standard for what distinguishes\na right from a wrong moderation decision at the moment. Nobody can really know\nwhat it is that the moderation team bases its decisions on. Nobody therefore\nis able to form clear expectations as to what is and isn't allowed and when\nand where and why. All of this can be decided on the spot without any reliable\nstandard.\n\nHence, it is unknown by which goal the moderation team is actually governed in\nits decision-making. We might have arrived at a suspicion by now, but to\nnewcomers, this is all necessarily opaque.\n\nAnd this in spite of the fact that the moderation team is taken to uphold the\nNixOS foundation mission statement by RFC 102 and that the moderation team\nadopted a Code of Conduct as late as November 2023. One wonders how the team\nrelates to these documents?\n\nIn a recent debate initiated by contributor Infinisil, moderator rhendric\nclarified the relationship of the moderation team to the Code of Conduct they\nthemselves adopted. Instead of seeing the Code of Conduct as a document \"that\nthe moderation team uses to guide their decisions\" as Infinisil thought, the\nfollowing explanation was given:\n\n> [...] there is a CoC that reasonably describes what we're aiming for in our\n> moderation processes. [...] if one of the bits of transparency you want is\n> citing which part of the CoC got violated when we take action\u2014we don't\n> operate like that. We take the least potent moderation action needed to\n> uphold the NixOS Foundation statement that RFC 102 tasks us with\n> implementing, and we are guided by each other when we do that.\n>\n> (Mon, Mar 11, 2024, 1:24 CET, Source:\n> https://matrix.to/#/!uzGGsQXWXsuwIqJImY:nixos.org/$syzY0wQ9wM7c1usw-\n> XxrmZpB5xjzNQlp7hy6rFCaAKM?via=nixos.org&via=matrix.org&via=nixos.dev\n> screen)\n\nSurprisingly then, the Code of Conduct appears to stand in no discernible\nrelation to the actual decisions being made. The decisions aren't based on the\nprescriptions of the Code in any way. Which raises the question: Why does the\nCode exist in the first place? And how can it \"reasonably describe\" anything\nat this point?\n\nThe authors of this document, being the liberal people that they are, stand\nfirm in the belief that what is not forbidden is allowed. Anything else would\nundermine the necessary spontaneity of contributors in an open environment. It\nwould burden them with fear of unjust punishment at a moment's notice. We need\nan understanding in advance of what is forbidden. Such an understanding is\nnotably absent.\n\nHow this plays out in the concrete could be seen from the circumstances of\nSrid's ban in November 2023. When asked to remove the link to\nhttps://srid.ca/unwoke from his Discourse page, he asked for the moderation\nteam to establish a general rule banning all such similar statements from\nbeing linked on community platforms publicly. This perfectly reasonable demand\nwas not adhered to in the slightest, or apparently even considered.\n\nWhat is the conclusion that we would draw from this explanation?\n\nThe moderation team refuses to abide by general reasons to guide their\nmoderation decisions which in our view violates a basic principle of equity.\nAll people have a right to know in advance what the rules of interaction are.\nAnd these rules need to be applied equally to all.\n\n#### 1.2 Concrete reasons are never provided but only ever demanded from\nothers. tldr: it's double standards once you start looking\n\nIn addition to the absence of general principles, one might be inclined to say\nthat general principles are replaced by case-by-case decisions, but cases are\nexplained only in abstract terms, never in relation to concrete evidence.\n\nThis we shall see now, leads to an ironic double standard making moderation\ndecisions effectively unaccountable all while being incomprehensible to those\naffected by them.\n\nIn the aftermath of Srid's ban in November 2023, a certain number of people\npublicly raised concerns that this ban was entirely unjustified. There was the\nopen suspicion that Srid's ban was motivated by political ideology while the\nmoderation team claimed this was due to his being \"confrontational.\"\n\nIn this context, long-standing contributor Shea Levy asked contributor and\nmoderation team lead Ryan Mullgian on GitHub whether Srid's ban was due to\ncertain political views he had linked in his Discourse profile:\n\n> @NixOS/moderation: @srid claims that this ban was due to a link to\n> https://srid.ca/unwoke in his Discourse profile. Is that correct?\n> https://github.com/NixOS/moderation/commit/e9d67b7efa03e6e9bc0bf2d03c6344d60c103395#commitcomment-132517786\n> screen\n\nTo which Ryan Mulligan provided the following answer:\n\n> On multiple occasions, Srid derailed discussions into a general\n> political/philosophical debate. Several posts have been hidden/deleted\n> because they also contained inflammatory speech. Several community members\n> have reported their discomfort with Srid. In that context, his Discourse\n> profile was seen as yet another provocation. In response to this, Srid was\n> given a warning. We asked him to stop being so confrontational, to remove\n> the link to that page on his profile, and to not link to it again in the\n> future, among other things. He partially complied but refused to change or\n> remove that link, then later continued to escalate by posting a public poll\n> on Discourse about this moderation question. This poll is exactly the\n> behavior we are trying to stop. We will not let our community be turned into\n> a general debate club or a circus. The suspension was precipitated from him\n> posting the poll and is the result of considering all this.\n>\n>\n> https://github.com/NixOS/moderation/commit/e9d67b7efa03e6e9bc0bf2d03c6344d60c103395#commitcomment-132624102\n> screen\n\nNotice how this answer provides no concrete reasons for Srid's ban. It deals\nonly in generalities that are unverifiable. Nobody can look up the multiple\noccasions of Srid derailing discussions, no one can see the hidden or deleted\nposts to judge whether they were inflammatory or harmless, and nobody knows\nwhether the discomfort that community members might have had was due to Srid's\nactual behavior or rather due to their own adherence to aggressive\nidentitarian ideologies that construed Srid as an ideological enemy.\n\nWhat everyone can verify, however, is that Srid is deeply committed to being\nas harmless as possible, and has since formulated his own Code of Conduct\nbased on this principle. A strange contrast.\n\nThis evidently insufficient response led contributor David Arnold (blaggacao)\n- who to our dismay has also since been banned by the moderation team, a team\nhe helped create in RFC 102 - to open a thread on moderation accountability.^2\nThis thread, because of the controversial nature of the decision, got somewhat\nmore emotional with several apparent adherents of left-leaning identitarian\nideologies becoming aggressive. The moderation team decided to lock it down,\ndelist it from Discourse and later even heavily censor it, removing 13 of the\noriginal posts even after it was unlisted and hence hidden from public search\nresults. However, the original version has been preserved in this particular\ncase.^3\n\nAt the very end of that thread, in a message that still stands at the time of\nthis writing, the same moderation team member Ryan Mulligan demanded from\ntheir critics:\n\n> If you find that your private concerns aren\u2019t handled, then you could\n> consider making some polite public post with a concretely argued position\n> rater than some vague concern.\n>\n> Moderator Ryan Mulligan https://discourse.nixos.org/t/moderation-team-\n> accountability-issues/35482/71 mirror\n\nAbstract declamations unto thee! But only concrete reasons unto me!\n\nWhat shall we conclude from this? Not providing concrete explanations to\nothers, but demanding the most concrete explanation if others intend to hold\nyou accountable.\n\nIt is fairly evident to us, that this makes for a good basis for all sorts of\ndouble standards! It also makes accountability next to impossible. Because\nunless you know what a decision was based upon, how could you investigate if\nit was done correctly?\n\nWe believe that this practice cannot continue. The lack of transparency and\nthe arbitrary nature of moderation decisions not only undermine trust but also\nfail to respect the community's right to understand the rationale behind\nsignificant actions that affect its members.\n\n### 2) The moderation team appears to kindle enmity between community members.\ntldr: some are more equal than others\n\n#### 2.1) The moderation team kindles attitudes which are potentially harmful\nto others. tldr: this is not nice!\n\nIn light of the power grab that doesn't want to be called one, mentioned at\nthe beginning, we shall now explore how the moderation team is enabling a\ncertain type of aggressive activism that sows enmity between contributors.\n\nThat this is indeed so has become apparent to us once we gained the impression\nthat there exists an effort to suppress only certain kinds of political speech\n(see the ban of Srid where no general rule was admitted) while enabling\nothers, even if these others are highly disconcerting.\n\nSince a few people have raised the issue over the last few months of banning\npolitical speech altogether from the Nix community, a situation that might\nseem preferable to the present one, the moderation team at one point had to\nclarify their stance on the matter.\n\nThis clarification is important. One of the more serious attempts in the\ndirection of restricting political speech was made by contributor Jon Ringer\ncreating a PR for a ban on unacceptable political activism:\n\n> To help avoid controversy in the future, I would still like to see\n> NixOS/.github#16 or something like that added to the CoC. Just make the\n> expectations clear that those things are better tackled outside Nix\n> Platforms.\n>\n> Contributor Jon Ringer, Tue, Mar 12, 2024, NixOS Governance Room on Matrix\n> https://matrix.to/#/!VyoUhyWvlhSpFWWxHL:matrix.org/$W6QrMhOJbtwjxL3-yquzfuxchLJHUWqFzfjeCh9fc0U?via=nixos.org&via=matrix.org&via=nixos.dev\n> screen\n\nThe moderation team did not follow up on this proposal to restrict political\nspeech more generally in any positive way but was rather dismissive of it. In\nthe context of this PR, the following explanation was given by the moderation\nteam:\n\n> [...] we are probably not going to impose a ban on political activism. The\n> tone of the activism isn't necessarily the discriminating factor either. We\n> won't allow activism that is counter to our mission of \u2018providing an\n> intentionally welcoming and safe environment where all feel valued and cared\n> for\u2019.\n>\n> Moderator rhendric, Tue, Mar 12, 2024, NixOS Governance Room on Matrix\n> https://matrix.to/#/!VyoUhyWvlhSpFWWxHL:matrix.org/$FC6KAUDoSdZXyBiMX39ShZlxkGgkh1u1tDLEvDQqkDs?via=nixos.org&via=matrix.org&via=nixos.dev\n> screen\n\nNotice that the tone of the activism is not a discriminating factor for the\nmoderation team. This might already be an indication that certain types of\nactivism are allowed to become uncivil in the community, and in our\nestimation, they are allowed to become uncivil to such an extent as to become\nverbally abusive of other community members and put significant emotional\nstrain on them.\n\nThis becomes particularly evident in a sequence of events all relating to one\nsuch politically activist-minded community member, we shall call him J for the\nsake of some minimal anonymization. To us, J appears to be entertaining a\nspecial relationship to the moderation team that some might say constitutes a\nform of favoritism.\n\nOver the course of the recent months, since the ban of Srid and the adoption\nof the Code of Conduct in Nov 2023, we have observed the following incidents:\n\n  * Defenders of the first Anduril sponsorship at the Europeans NixCon 2023 who participated in the discussion on Discourse have been termed \"murder machine apologists\" by J in the NixOS foundation Matrix room, likening them linguistically to people who defend actual murder. We believe that such rhetoric is inappropriate in a professional setting.\n\nAs we shall see, however, this is not an isolated incident. It is also worth\nnoting that these defamed people were deemed \"not, in fact, people who create\na safe environment for marginalized folk\", hence the attack was made in the\ncontext for an argument using the myth of marginalization against an imaginary\nenemy - normal community members mind you! - to be vilified.\nhttps://matrix.to/#/!CJXQiUGqNPcFonEdME:nixos.org/$GNOHzZx-\nf_7Fkkgg4f4auQpTNa9tB4aa33oHQxzArwg?via=nixos.org&via=matrix.org&via=nixos.dev\nscreen\n\n  * In the already mentioned hidden thread on Discourse, opened by David Arnold (blaggacao), J claimed an unidentified post of Srid was a \"bigoted screed that is exactly the sort of thing written by people who - quite literally - intend to murder us marginalized folks, or wish for others to do so.\" Thereby likening Srid to people with - quite literal - homicidal intent against minorities. This claim does establish a pattern: Creating a rhetorical resemblance between an actual behavior with a really hideous behavior, apt to do harm against the public image of a contributor to the Nix community. https://srid.ca/nixos-mod/accountability-thread\n\n  * In late 2023 a long-standing contributor to nixpkgs was attacked verbally by J for his attempt to raise a critical question with respect to J's behavior. J claimed that this critical attempt was tantamount to \"clear-cut abuser behavior\" and running \"experiments on people's emotional state without their consent\", in this case on J's emotional state. We should note that there is no evidence in our mind that these depictions given by J even come close to an accurate account of the situation.\n\nRather what is striking to us is that, just like in the cases above, J yet\nagain likens other community members' behavior rhetorically to a particularly\nhorrid kind of behavior, in this case to a scientist running unethical\nexperiments on people against their will. Obviously no such thing ever\nhappened. However, this creates yet another instance of the aforementioned\nrhetorical pattern. Needless to say there were no public statements against\nthis behavior from the moderation team.\nhttps://matrix.to/#/!VyoUhyWvlhSpFWWxHL:matrix.org/$Y-ndXmAfGUXPPfOD_YvOE59pj8gQzp1kI4tBdXQR13w?via=nixos.org&via=matrix.org&via=nixos.dev\nscreen\n\n  * To the moderation team J has claimed that there has been a streak of harassment going on for years, presumably against him and some people like him. We have found no indication of this being true. The claim appears to us to be overly dramatic and somewhat construed.\n\n  * When first contributor Jon Ringer and later contributor David Arnold (blaggacao) tried to intervene on the aforementioned situation in late 2023, Jon Ringer was first verbally assaulted by J, and David Arnold's attempt at mediation led to his unprovoked ban by the moderation team. We note that the kind of behavior David Arnold showed was something one might expect from anyone in a community with a healthy and open culture of communication. As some of the relevant messages in this context have later been redacted, they are no longer to be easily found on Matrix.\n\nA while later J decided that it might be a good idea if he gave private\npolitical lessons to people.\n\nIn the context of the awareness of J's past behavior, one of the two authors\nof this RFC decided to raise a few clarification questions with respect to J's\noffer. This was done in order to prevent other people from being harmed given\nthat there appeared to be an established pattern of such things being\npossible.\n\nOnce these questions were posted, the moderation team felt obliged to make an\nofficial statement on Discourse. The name has obviously been redacted, as this\nis primarily about the moderation team:\n\n> As a community, we\u2019ve recently struggled to have conversations related to\n> this idea without overheating. I\u2019m encouraged by J\u2019s attitude and approach\n> here, and I would like to see this experiment succeed. Given the volatility\n> of the subject, I\u2019d like to ask everyone who might be interested in having J\n> as a tutor to remember periodically to reflect on your emotional\n> temperature, and to bias yourself toward taking some time to cool off if you\n> need it. [...] Respectful speech remains a basic expectation of NixOS\n> spaces.\n>\n> Moderator rhendric's official statement https://discourse.nixos.org/t/open-\n> offer-politics-in-tech-sessions/40097/3 mirror\n\nWe find this statement to be highly disconcerting. Given the lack of\nrespectfulness and civility we experienced coming from J, and the moderation\nteam's evident awareness of this, who is the addressee of these demands? Is\nthe respectfulness only an expectation raised against some, but not against\nothers? Is civility a demand only held against a certain subsection of the\ncommunity?\n\nIf the moderation team does not wish to engage in \"tone-policing,\" as some\nmight say, we note that such tone-policing was no problem when moderator Hexa\nintervened against contributor amjospeh on GitHub, leading to amjoseph\nquitting the project over concerns with this approach to governance. His\nstatement reads like this: \"@amjoseph-nixpkgs You need to tone done your\ncommit messages and start communicating with others, continued collaboration\nreally isn't going to work any other way.\" NixOS/nixpkgs#282220 (comment)\nscreen\n\nIs tone-policing acceptable against highly productive contributors, but not\nagainst people giving political lessons to others with what appears to us to\nbe a history of verbal aggressiveness?\n\nBut most importantly perhaps, how shall we take it that the moderation team\nwas encouraged by J\u2019s attitude? At that time J had already established quite\nan attitudinal pattern of verbally attacking other community members.\nCommunity members which the moderation team chose not to protect in public\nfrom such attacks.\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough already, there is much more disconcerting\ninformation to be found on J's personal website indicating that such an\nattitudinal pattern is much older than the events of the last few months might\nindicate on their own. As this website is publicly accessible, and the\nmoderation might well be aware of it, we think it is well within their\nresponsibilities to check on whom they confer their trust in improving the\ncommunity.\n\nAt the time of this writing (2024/19/04) J's personal website contains the\nfollowing statements about himself:\n\n> In case it hasn't become obvious to you yet, I am a social engineer. Full-\n> time. 24/7. I use manipulation and other psychological tactics in nearly\n> every conversation I have. I will try to change the way you think, and try\n> to solve problems you might not even realize you had.\n\nAnd somewhat further down:\n\n> The only case where I will escalate a situation to more severe things (think\n> doxing), is when I have already talked to you, and you actively refuse to\n> listen while harming others in the process. Very few people have ever\n> reached this stage.\n\nWe do not link this website here, as it might be somewhat disturbing to read\nit all, however it is easy to find these statements.\n\nThe real question we wish to raise however is this: Why does the moderation\nteam officially find the attitudes towards political discourse of someone with\nthis pattern on the public record encouraging? Bear in mind that none of this\ncontains secret or private information. It is all things that are easy to come\nby within minutes to anyone responsible enough to go and look them up.\n\nTo us this only makes sense in light of an attempt of abusing the moderation\nteam's authority for strengthening the foothold of identitarian ideologies\ninside the Nix community. Recent events appear to us to confirm this.\n\nDo you, dear reader, wish to become the object of full-time social\nengineering, and then, in case you resist said social engineering to an extent\nthat the social engineer judges to be harmful, be potentially subjected to\ndoxing?\n\nAnd this all the while the moderation team is telling the community that the\npolitical attitudes of the one doing, by his own admission, social engineering\n24/7, are encouraging?\n\nWe do not.\n\n#### 2.2) How identitarian activists view other community members. tldr: you\nare beneath them!\n\nAs a last piece, we wish to share what political attitude might be behind all\nthis. In a more recent controversy, which also got closed down and then hidden\nfrom the public eye by the moderation team, said user J made clear how he\nviews communication with other members of our technical community:\n\n> There is no discussion \u201cwith peers\u201d to be had here.\n\nThis denial of others being his peers, which is a denial of their baseline\nequality as community members, with him ascribing himself a special competence\nwhen it comes to political questions, a competence that is unaccountable to\nothers, appears to us to be at the core of the problem.\n\n> If you\u2019re not qualified, then you should be leaving these considerations to\n> the people who are, instead of trying to inject yourself or your opinions\n> into them.\n\nOther people's opinions are no longer solicited. When it comes to political\ndisagreements, only one side is to be heard; the other is to be silent. The\ninjunction to obey in silence and not share one's opinions could hardly be\nexpressed more clearly.\n\nTo us, these statements are the hallmark of aggressive left-wing\nidentitarianism, getting verbally abusive against others in order to establish\na hierarchy of dominance.\n\nLet us ask you directly one more time, dear reader: would you find\nencouragement in these attitudes when your goal was to lead this community, a\ncommunity you are a part of, into less turbulent waters? Would choosing this\nperson to give political lessons to others be seen as encouraging in the eyes\nof anyone else knowing about this sequence of events?\n\nAnd would you have trust in the competence of those authorities who did choose\nto support such messengers? We leave this judgement to you.\n\nTo us, there was nothing encouraging to be found here.\n\nTo us, this is no \"intentionally welcoming and safe environment where all feel\nvalued and cared for.\"\n\n#### 3) Revisiting Srid's ban and its aftermath. tldr: there is no\njustification, it's all personal for the \"moderation\" team.\n\nLet us finally come to a particularly interesting topic: Srid's ban. Or rather\nthe unknown aftermath of it. As the best documentation of the ban itself and\nthe circumstances leading to it is ironically provided by Srid himself, in\nwhat we find is an extremely objective and calm statement, given that he was\non the receiving end of a massive abuse of power.^4\n\nWe already mentioned how the moderation team was not willing or able to\npublicly state which concrete reasons actually motivated the ban. This led to\none of the two authors to begin an attempt to figure out what the reasons for\nSrid's ban actually were and how they could be addressed constructively.\n\nThis attempt at constructive improvement ended with what appears to be a\nvindictive lashing out by the moderation team, in particular moderator Hexa,\nagainst banned contributor Srid and a blatant breach of the trust that was\nplaced in private communication.\n\nPrivate communication with the moderation team was initiated in December after\nSrid's ban, because moderator Ryan Mulligan had given the following promise to\nthe community as a whole:\n\n> We'll continue communicating with Srid and there is opportunity for\n> redemption if he's willing to participate constructively.\n>\n>\n> https://github.com/NixOS/moderation/commit/e9d67b7efa03e6e9bc0bf2d03c6344d60c103395#commitcomment-132624102\n> screen\n\nSo the moderation team was taken up on their promise, the communication\nbetween them and Srid was supposed to be in private, and accompanied by one of\nthe two authors of this RFC. This was done to prevent any mutual escalation\nfrom happening yet again. As Ryan had claimed that Srid \"derailed discussions\"\non \"multiple occasions\", it seemed important that no such escalation was to\nhappen yet again.\n\nAs the moderation team insisted on Srid making the first attempt to establish\ncommunication, Srid was encouraged to do so, and in fact did with a short\nemail asking for possible terms of his return into the Nix community. That was\non Dec 12, 2023. And then nothing happened. No response, just silence. So we\nwaited. Every two weeks, Srid was writing a new message to the moderation\nteam, following up on his request.\n\nOn Sun, Jan 21, 2024, we finally got a response from the moderation team,\nbarely 6 weeks after the initial short email was written. The nature of the\nresponse left us bitterly disappointed. Srid's return into the Nix community\nwas rejected on very spurious grounds by moderator Hexa.\n\nHowever, only a few hours before writing this email, Hexa himself had\nintervened on a harmless post that Srid had made on lobste.rs, where Srid was\npresenting a Nix tutorial he had been working on.\n\nWithout any provocation and in complete abuse of the authority given to him as\na NixOS moderation team member, which is limited to Nix community platforms,\nand clearly not intended to harm people outside such platforms, the following\nstatement was made in an official sounding voice:\n\n> I\u2019m a member of NixOS moderation team, see\n> https://nixos.org/community/teams/moderation. Srid was banned\n> (https://github.com/NixOS/moderation/commit/e9d67b7efa03e6e9bc0bf2d03c6344d60c103395)\n> from our community, and is now trying to drive traffic to their third party\n> communication platform.\n>\n> Moderator Hexa intervening publicly outside the Nix community without\n> provocation against Srid while private communication was ongoing\n> https://archive.is/Z2BU3 & https://archive.is/75A7j\n\nAs a result of this intervention, a moderator on lobste.rs decided to ban Srid\non very dubious grounds. It stands to reason that personal connections between\nthe two teams are behind this ban of Srid on lobste.rs. We noted initially\nthat Irene Knapp, the main author of the failed RFC 98, is part of the\nmoderation team on lobste.rs. However, such things remain in the realm of\nspeculation and cannot be proven at this time.\n\nWhat is certain though is that community moderation ends at the boundaries of\nthat very community. This boundary was evidently crossed, creating more harm\nfor Srid in the process, all while private communication was still ongoing.\n\nThe attempt to privately communicate with the moderation team appears to us to\nhave been abused for engaging in what we can only see as an act of personal\nvindictiveness. At least we do not see any possibility for a good-faith\ninterpretation of these events. Evidently no explanation of this move was ever\ngiven to anyone involved.\n\nFor all we can say, the earlier statement by Ryan Mulligan on behalf of the\nentire team, appears to have been a lie to the entire community, designed to\ndistract rather than to actually work constructively on a path forward for\nSrid. We received no signs of constructive communication ever being intended.\n\nWe can only warn anyone else in the future: As long as the present hierarchy\nis in place, do not put any trust in the claim that solutions can be found in\nprivate communication. Our experience has shown us that the most likely\nexplanation for why private communication is preferred is the attempt by the\ncurrent moderation hierarchy to protect itself against public scrutiny and\naccountability.\n\nThe moderation team in its present institutional and personal setup cannot be\ntrusted to communicate faithfully in private.\n\nIn order to ensure that this situation sees a swift and substantial\nimprovement we have created the two proposals joint together in our RFC.\n\n#### 5) Ending on a positive note: What we would wish for\n\nEnding on a positive note after so many negative experiences might be a good\nidea, we thought.\n\nOthers should understand what we would wish for instead of what we\nexperienced. Our proposal is not designed to enact any kind of personal\nvendetta like the ones we apparently had to witness ourselves. Instead, it is\nmeant to ensure that such behavior is no longer possible in the future.\n\nIn particular, we wish for:\n\n  * Civility in interaction as a demand to all and anyone. We have seen examples of uncivil language above. We wish this to be replaced with civility.\n\n  * One normative standard applied to all. This does not mean inflexibility in recognizing individual hardship. But it means no differences in normative status based on political affiliation or presumed identity.\n\n  * An end to the divisive agitation of identitarian activism inside this technical project. The behavior and language this entails has done enough damage on an overall societal level already.\n\n  * And finally, and maybe most importantly: We wish that the present situation be overcome, a more equitable scheme of moderation be implemented. But that no resentment be felt against any of the present or past members of the moderation team.\n\nWe view this as an institutional problem not an individual problem. It is the\nway this institution has been set up and has grown organically which led to\nthis situation, not the inherent character of people. The institution being\nill-founded combined with the influence of the identitarian snare gave rise to\nthe possibility of such a streak of bad behavior. Let us not condemn this bad\nbehavior more than is inevitable to see the necessity of change.\n\nLet us reform the institution of the moderation team instead and ensure that\nsuch events have no future.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n  1. By a myth, we understand an ultimately irrational fiction devoid of a factual base, used to create group cohesion and legitimize harmful behavior against those designated as out-group or threats to the in-group. In this sense, the myth of marginalization creates the in-group, while the myth of fascism creates an external enemy. Or in our case: it is used to attack other contributors and users, potentially harming them in the process, under the false pretense of them being an actual threat. \u21a9\n\n  2.
