Voyez \"L\u2019effet nocebo dans la pratique\ncourante\".\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nIn 2013, the European Journal of Neurology published a meta-analysis examining\npatient dropout rates owing to medication side effects in clinical trials for\nParkinson disease treatments.^^1 A review of more than a decade of various\ntrials showed that nearly two-thirds of patients reported an adverse event\nafter drug therapy. Worse still, nearly one-tenth (8.8%) of the patients in a\nspecific arm of the studies experienced such horrific side effects that they\nwere forced to stop treatment altogether. Strangely, this subset of patients\nhad not been given any active medication at all\u2014they had been given a placebo.\n\nThe placebo arm of a research study is crucial to the modern scientific method\nand is used to better understand the medication and confirm that it gives a\ntrue result beyond subjective experience. Much has been written about the\nplacebo effect in recent years, but lesser known and understood is placebo\u2019s\nevil twin, the nocebo.\n\nGo to:\n\n## What is the nocebo effect?\n\nNocebo has been defined as\n\n> a harmless substance or treatment that when taken by or administered to a\n> patient is associated with harmful side effects or worsening of symptoms due\n> to negative expectations or the psychological condition of the patient.^^2\n\nTo put it simply, bad expectations and \u201cnegative vibes\u201d in a clinical\nencounter involving a prescribed medication lead to the patient experiencing\nreal harm as an outcome.\n\nThe idea of \u201cbad vibes\u201d causing harm goes back centuries. Dr Walter Cannon\n(the Harvard physician who introduced us to the fight or flight response)\ndiscussed this in his well-known article on \u201cvoodoo death.\u201d^^3 Dr Cannon wrote\nabout this phenomenon in various cultures. He observed that the idea that\ndeath would result from a medicine man pointing a bone at his victim was a\npowerful cultural and spiritual belief. The victim often became hopelessly ill\nand fatigued over the course of days without any clear cause. It was the\nnocebo effect at its most extreme\u2014a psychologically induced death:\n\n> When Dr. Lambert arrived ... he learned that Rob was in distress .... Dr.\n> Lambert made the examination, and found no fever, no complaint of pain, no\n> symptoms or signs of disease. He was impressed, however, by the obvious\n> indications that Rob was seriously ill and extremely weak. From the\n> missionary he learned that Rob had had a bone pointed at him by Nebo and was\n> convinced that in consequence he must die. Thereupon Dr. Lambert and the\n> missionary went for Nebo, threatened him sharply that his supply of food\n> would be shut off if anything happened to Rob .... At once Nebo agreed to go\n> with them to see Rob. He leaned over Rob\u2019s bed and told the sick man that it\n> was all a mistake, a mere joke\u2014indeed, that he had not pointed a bone at him\n> at all. The relief, Dr. Lambert testifies, was almost instantaneous; that\n> evening Rob was back at work, quite happy again, and in full possession of\n> his physical strength.^^3\n\nA similar example in 20th-century medicine involved Mr Wright and his\ncancerous tumours.^^4 Mr Wright suffered from advanced lymphosarcoma, but he\nhad faith in a final resort\u2014a horse-serum\u2013derived substance called Krebiozen.\nHe requested Krebiozen injections from his physician, and sure enough, his\ntumours shrank dramatically on x-ray scans. He spent several months in good\nhealth before reports came out stating that Krebiozen had no cancer-fighting\nproperties. Then Mr Wright\u2019s tumours returned\u2014visible and larger than ever.\n\nHis physicians chose to lie to him. They told him that Krebiozen did indeed\ncure cancer, but that he needed a much stronger dose for the full effect. Sham\ntreatments with saline injections caused his cancer to presumably disappear\ncompletely. Mr Wright lived in good health for several months until a final\nreview by the American Medical Association conclusively stated that Krebiozen\nwas a useless drug. When Mr Wright learned this, his tumours reappeared. He\nwas dead within days of admission to the hospital.\n\nIn an established patient-physician relationship, patients are often in a\nhighly suggestible state. During such an encounter, a clinician\u2019s words might\nbe as potent as a drug injection. Yet how much thought in medical education\nhas been given to this idea?\n\nGo to:\n\n## Evidence for the nocebo effect\n\nMore than anecdotes support the nocebo effect. An article was published in\n2011 titled \u201cThe nocebo effect and its relevance for clinical practice,\u201d in\nwhich researchers examined treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia and\ntheir side effects, among other therapies for other conditions.^^5 One group\nwas informed about possible sexual side effects and the other was not. At\n6-month and 12-month follow-up, \u201cthose patients who were informed about the\npossibility of sexual dysfunction reported significantly greater sexual side\neffects (43.6%), as compared to those who were not informed (15.3%).\u201d^^5\nInvestigators concluded that the discussion of potential side effects during\ninformed consent can induce the nocebo effect.\n\nVarious studies have confirmed physiologic mechanisms for the nocebo effect\nand its ability to produce a range of symptoms. An anesthesiology study\nexamined physiologic processes during pain perception to explain increased\npain in patients with negative expectations of pain and anticipatory\nanxiety.^^6 Another study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to show\nthat positive expectations toward the opioid remifentanil doubled its\nanalgesic effect owing to associations with observable activity in endogenous\npain modulation in the brain.^^7 It has also been proposed that\n\n> verbal suggestions of a positive outcome (pain decrease) activate endogenous\n> \u03bc-opioid neurotransmission, while suggestions of a negative outcome (pain\n> increase) activate CCK-A [cholecystokinin A] and/or CCK-B receptors.^^8\n\nGastrointestinal effects can also be induced via nocebo. Myers et al found\nthat simply mentioning possible gastrointestinal side effects \u201cresulted in a\nsixfold increase (P < 0.001) in the number of subjects in these centers\nwithdrawing from the study because of subjective, minor gastrointestinal\nsymptoms.\u201d^^9 A similar nocebo response has been observed for muscle\nrelaxants.^^10 Researchers were able to cause (and measure) a decrease in the\nbronchodilator effect of isoproterenol simply by telling patients that it was\na bronchoconstrictor, rather than a bronchodilator.^^11\n\nA 2009 systematic review of antimigraine medication clinical trials also\nshowed the power of nocebo:\n\n> In addition, and most interestingly, the adverse events in the placebo arms\n> corresponded to those of the anti-migraine medication against which the\n> placebo was compared. For example, anorexia and memory difficulties, which\n> are typical adverse events of anticonvulsants, were present only in the\n> placebo arm of these trials. These results suggest that the adverse events\n> in placebo arms of clinical trials of antimigraine medications depend on the\n> adverse events of the active medication against which the placebo is\n> compared. These findings are in accordance with the expectation theory of\n> placebo and nocebo effects.^^12\n\nIf we see such measurable outcomes in controlled trials, how much more\ninfluence is carried by the words of a physician whom the patient has known\nand trusted for years? Thus, we face a balancing act with each clinical\nencounter.\n\nGo to:\n\n## Walking the fine line\n\nOur profession obligates us to discuss the common and potentially serious side\neffects of medications with patients. No physician should mislead a patient.\nPotentially serious side effects should never be concealed and need to be\noutlined clearly. However, physicians should also be aware of the fine line\nbetween informing a patient of a medication\u2019s side effects and of inducing\nthose side effects in a suggestible patient.\n\nAdditionally, some patients might \u201ctalk themselves out of\u201d taking their\nmedication. In my medical practice, an unnecessary and overly detailed review\nof a dozen possible side effects, often at the request of anxious patients,\nhas occasionally kept them from starting medications that would have been\nbeneficial for their overall health.\n\nFurther, some of the various listed side effects of medications often have\nlittle or no demonstrated causality and are generally taken from participant\ncomments in drug trial reports without much further scrutiny.\n\nThe nocebo effect is, by its nature, challenging to study in a rigorous\nscientific setting. There are obvious ethical concerns with deliberately\nplacing suggestions of negative outcomes in patients\u2019 heads. Nonetheless,\nthere might be utility in studying which patient characteristics make them\nmore susceptible to nocebo.\n\nA study published in JAMA listed the following clinical risk factors for\nsusceptibility to the nocebo effect^^13:\n\n  * the patient\u2019s expectations of adverse effects at the outset of treatment;\n\n  * a process of conditioning in which patients learn from previous experiences to associate taking medication with somatic symptoms;\n\n  * certain psychological characteristics such as anxiety, depression, and the tendency to somatize; and\n\n  * situational and contextual factors.\n\nResearch into further such clinical models might allow physicians to better\nnavigate encounters with nocebo effect\u2013prone patients. It is the\nresponsibility of all clinicians to be aware of this effect and to diminish it\nas much as possible in their medical practices.\n\nWe must grow to appreciate the tangible power that our words hold over our\npatients. The challenge we face is how to create a more positive-minded\nenvironment for patients, while also remaining honest about their prognoses\nand the risks of the medical therapies we offer them.\n\nGo to:\n\n## Notes\n\nFirst Five Years is a quarterly series in Canadian Family Physician,\ncoordinated by the First Five Years in Family Practice Committee of the\nCollege of Family Physicians of Canada.
