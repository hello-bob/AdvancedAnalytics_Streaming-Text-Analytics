M. Hansteen on 2024-04-23 from the are these all trees\ndept.\n\nThe version control system gameoftrees 0.98 has been released and should soon\nshow up in OpenBSD -current packages. An update for the -portable version will\nfollow as well.\n\nThe main improvements in the new release are listed in the release notes as\n\n>\n>     - speed up got tag -l by caching timestamps in got_ref_cmp_tags() -\n> provide a macro for vi(1) path for use by -portable at compile time - avoid\n> a rename/stat race when gotd installs a new pack and then uses it - make\n> 'got ref -l' output consistent when packed references exist - make 'got ref\n> -l' work consistently when a reference argument is given - add initial\n> support for notifications to gotd(8), via email and http/json\n\n>\n>     - display process title in syslog when a gotd child process exits - hide\n> a pointless end-of-file error on imsg pipe in libexec helpers - plug a\n> memory leak in 'got blame' - add support for topological sorting to the\n> commit graph - add log -t option which enables topological sorting of\n> commits - make 'got rebase' find a merge base with topological sorting if\n> needed - call unveil(2) earlier during import, commit, histedit, and tag\n> commands - make 'got status' display interrupted rebase, histedit, and merge\n> operations - got.1: escape Eq since it's a GNU roff macro, to fix rendering\n> in -portable - regress: use seq instead of jot, for portability reasons -\n> get rid of unnecessary \"dns inet\" pledge promises while fetching via git://\n> - add http clone/fetch support using a new got-fetch-http helper - drop\n> git+ssh protocol name from documentation; Git has done the same - require -R\n> option for staging or unstaging directory contents - got patch: fix applying\n> on empty files\n\nSee the release notes for details.
