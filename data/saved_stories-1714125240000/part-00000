The declines come as Juniper Networks, FireEye,\nand other companies have rolled out products and services that take a\ndecidedly different approach to securing computers and networks. Rather than\nscan for files that are categorized as malicious, these newer techniques aim\nto detect, minimize, and contain the damage that attackers can do in the event\nthat they penetrate a customer's defenses. Citing Symantec Senior President\nBrian Dye, the WSJ said:\n\n> Mr. Dye, who has spent more than a decade with Symantec, says it was galling\n> to watch other security companies surge ahead. \"It's one thing to sit there\n> and get frustrated,\" he says. \"It's another thing to act on it, go get your\n> act together and go play the game you should have been playing in the first\n> place.\"\n>\n> Symantec pioneered computer security with its antivirus software in the late\n> 1980s. The technology keeps hackers out by checking against a list of\n> malicious code spotted on computers. Think of it as an immune system for\n> machines.\n>\n> But hackers increasingly use novel bugs. Mr. Dye estimates antivirus now\n> catches just 45% of cyberattacks.\n>\n> That puts Symantec in a pickle. Antivirus and other products that run on\n> individual devices still account for more than 40% of the company's revenue.\n> Specialized cybersecurity services for businesses account for less than one-\n> fifth of revenue and generate smaller profit margins. It would be\n> impractical, if not impossible, to sell such services to individual\n> consumers.\n\nTo be fair, Symantec began to move beyond malware long ago. Its Norton\nsecurity suite has long included a password manager and code that detects\nmalicious e-mails and Web links. Heuristic algorithms also attempt to detect\nmalicious files even when they have never been seen before. But increasingly,\nSymantec is competing against its newer rivals by matching the suite of non-AV\nservices they provide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Mountain View, California-based company is creating its own response team\nto help companies that have been hacked. Within six months, Symantec also\nplans to sell intelligence briefings on specific threats so clients can gain a\nbetter understanding of the root causes behind costly network compromises.\n\"Symantec also is developing technology to look for more-advanced malicious\nsoftware inside a network that mimics offerings from its rivals,\" the Journal\nsaid.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n155\n\nDan Goodin Dan Goodin is Senior Security Editor at Ars Technica, where he\noversees coverage of malware, computer espionage, botnets, hardware hacking,\nencryption, and passwords.
