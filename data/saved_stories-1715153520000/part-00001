Or at least what we don't.\n\nPeople who tell others to learn to code pile implicit assumptions into the\nstatement.\n\nLearn to code...\n\n...to fix your tools.\n\n...to make your own tools.\n\n...for fun.\n\n...for freedom!\n\n...for money!\n\n...to understand your computer!\n\nStruggling with the awful UI in most open source tools never felt particularly\nfree. Engaging with the kind of people who comment on issues and pull requests\non Github has never been fun. I'm never going to out-do the people who make my\ntools: stuff like Ableton Live and the Affinity Suite are lightyears ahead of\nevery open source alternative, and I just do not have the interest in coding\nto get capable enough to make my own.\n\nSure, sometimes I make a little script in WSL for some useful thing, but it\ntakes an hour of research to remember all I forgot from the last time I\nthought about code. I spent 2 years getting a networking degree (AAS) with a\nfocus on Linux. We had a whole book on Bash! I still have to look up the\noperator for sending output to a file.\n\nI am not a coder in any natural or intuitive sense, not in the way the most\nvociferous \"learn to code!\" champions often are.\n\nAnd as a job, most people who make more than they could doing just about\nanything else came out of elite colleges with job offers in hand. You and I\nare not destined for high-paying careers in software development without an\namount of effort that would get meaningful results doing what we actually want\nto do.\n\nOne thing worth knowing is how your computer works, and learning the basics of\njust about any programming language will cover that. I hear stories from\nteachers of having to teach kids what a file system is so they can save files\nfor what they work on in class. Kids aren't learning about files and memory\nthe way my generation did, and we only learned it by necessity.\n\nIf I wanted to play Wing Commander, I had to know how to edit batch files to\nset up extended memory. The basics of computing are still worth learning even\nif all the natural pathways have gone away.\n\nSo sure, learn to code, but focus it with purpose. Go into it knowing what you\nwant to get out of it so you can ask the right questions, pick the right\ntools, and set the right goal.\n\n## Sign up for Kye Fox\n\nKye Fox blogs about fandom, answers your questions, and makes music\n\nNo spam.
