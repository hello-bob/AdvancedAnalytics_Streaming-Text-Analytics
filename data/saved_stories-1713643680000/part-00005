As co-founder & CEO of\nZapier, he\u2019s built and scaled one of the most innovative platforms for no-code\nworkflow automations. Famously, Zapier has only raised $1.3 million total \u2014\nand has managed to springboard that into an astronomical $5 billion valuation.\n\nAnd while the company\u2019s unconventional fundraising strategy is what\u2019s\ntypically snagged the headlines, there are plenty of other unorthodox moves\nwhen you look under Zapier\u2019s hood. In fact, the company\u2019s independent streak\ncan be traced all the way back to its roots. Bucking the usual startup trend,\nZapier\u2019s was started in 2011 in Columbia, Missouri \u2013 far from the hotbed of\nhigh-growth startups. Early-stage companies have all sorts of challenges, from\nhiring the early team, finding product-market fit, and finely tuning the go-\nto-market strategy. Starting one in the Midwest might come with even more of a\nsteep elevation to climb.\n\nBut what seemed like a disadvantage Foster actually credits with paving the\nway for Zapier\u2019s outsized success. This physical distance from tech\u2019s\nepicenter is what enabled Foster and his co-founders Bryan Helmig and Mike\nKnoop to sidestep the cookie-cutter advice for scaling a business (like \u2018Raise\nas much as you can!\u2019 or \u2018Hire fast to pick up momentum!\u2019).\n\n> I had skeptical ears when I would hear the Silicon Valley advice around,\n> \u201cWell, you can't build a company that way,\u201d or \u201cYou'll never be an important\n> company doing it that way.\u201d\n\nFoster likens his approach with Zapier to playing poker. Sure, there\u2019s a\ngeneral set of guidelines and best practices to follow, but there\u2019s no golden\nrule that applies to every single hand. \u201cWe tried to deeply understand the\ncards that we were dealt and if the advice applies in the particular situation\nthat we've got,\u201d he says.\n\nOne example here? Zapier was remote-first way back in 2012, long before it was\nen vogue. \u201cIt certainly made it a lot easier for us as a young company with\nvery little hiring experience to compete for talent. We realized that we're\nnot going to try and go toe-to-toe with Google or Facebook or Netflix to hire\nBay Area engineers. We're going to go compete for all of the great talent that\ndoesn't live in the Bay Area \u2014 that gave us a really incredible advantage.\u201d\n\nIn our conversation with Foster, he takes us through his approach to building\nand continuing to scale Zapier, emphasizing the need for questioning\nconventional wisdom and taking the path that makes the most sense for your\ncompany, even if it\u2019s the road less traveled. We pluck out eight key lessons\nfrom Foster\u2019s atypical approach, covering everything from his famed\nfundraising strategy, to building Zapier\u2019s distribution engine before building\nthe product, and what he got right (and wrong) about hiring.\n\n## CHALLENGING CONVENTIONAL WISDOM: LESSONS FROM THE ROAD LESS TRAVELED\n\nIf Foster were to boil down his philosophy on building startups, it would be\nsimply: be a plus-one. \u201cIt stands for this idea of every day you show up, just\nmake things one bit better. And that sentiment can easily get lost in the\nmidst of grand strategies or visions,\u201d he says. \u201cBut so much of company\nbuilding is literally just showing up day after day and doing that for a\nreally long period of time and just putting in the work.\u201d\n\n> Building startups is not a particularly glamorous thing in spite of how the\n> media makes it look. A lot of it is just doing sales or doing customer\n> support hundreds of thousands of times over and over again and being really\n> committed to becoming exceptional at it.\n\nWith that framing in mind, he shares his plus-one approaches to some of the\nmost common questions founders face \u2014 from raising money, hiring the early\nteam, and building the product\u2019s MVP.\n\nWade Foster, co-founder and CEO of Zapier\n\n### Lesson 1: You don\u2019t need to raise a boatload of money\n\nAfter founding Zapier in Missouri, Foster had to look for ways to grow the\ncompany outside of drumming up truckloads of funding. \u201cIt's not like we had a\nton of people in the Midwest knocking on our door to give us millions of\ndollars to start a software company,\u201d he says.\n\nOne of his key reference points for getting off the ground was his former\nemployer, Veterans United. Another Missouri-based company, Veterans United has\ncompletely innovated the VA home loan process \u2013 all without raising a dime.\n\u201cThey\u2019re the entrepreneurial poster child in Columbia, Missouri,\u201d says Foster.\n\u201cI remember I joined there in early 2011 and was the 500th employee, and by\nthe time I left 10 months later, there were 1,000.\u201d\n\nTraditional startup founders may be hesitant to plan on starting (and growing)\na company without much backing. \u201cBut our reference point is an incredibly\nfast-growing company, one that is doing exceptionally well, has an actual\nbusiness, making profits,\u201d says Foster. \u201cIt forced us to ask: \u2018Does that\nadvice really apply to us?\u2019 It didn\u2019t, so we just said, \u2018Well, that\u2019s good\nadvice, but for a different company.\u2019\u201d\n\nEventually, Zapier would go on to raise a single, $1.3 million dollar round \u2014\nwhich would be the last set of checks the company would cash from investors\n(for more details here, check out the full Review article on Zapier's one-and-\ndone fundraising approach).\n\n### Lesson 2: Think about distribution from day one\n\nIf you\u2019re going to build a product, you want people to use it. But far too\noften, founders get drawn to the building and tinkering side of the business,\nforgoing the go-to-market piece until they\u2019re actually ready to get out and\nsell.\n\nThat\u2019s a mistake, says Foster. \u201cI think one of the biggest things that\nfounders \u2013 especially product-minded founders \u2013 overlook is they say, \u2018Oh, I\nhave some great ideas for product X, Y, Z in this category. The incumbent\nstinks for these reasons, and I think I can make a better version of it than,\nsay, Salesforce.\u2019 What they don\u2019t realize is that the thing that actually\nhelps Salesforce win is not necessarily that the product is amazing, it\u2019s that\nthey have an incredible distribution engine that is really difficult to\ncompete against.\u201d\n\nWhen it came to architecting Zapier\u2019s distribution strategy, Foster turned to\nan unlikely source of inspiration: Patrick\u2019s McKenzie\u2019s Bingo Card Creator.\n\u201cHe would spin up these landing pages for every type of bingo card he could\nthink of: Physics bingo card, U.S. history bingo card, world history bingo\ncard, etc. These landing pages would rank really well on Google. We saw that\nand thought that\u2019s quite interesting,\u201d he says.\n\nBingo cards and integrations don\u2019t seem to have all that much in common, but\nZapier\u2019s founders drew the parallels. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for integrations,\nthere are all these different keyword results that you could conceivably rank\nfor, but no one is trying to rank for this stuff. If we had a landing page\nthat says you could connect Salesforce and Zendesk, or you could connect\nQuickBooks and PayPal, that would stand out,\u201d says Foster. (A caveat here \u2014 he\nnotes that this approach, while novel in 2011, wouldn\u2019t work nearly as well\ntoday because there\u2019s much more search competition.)\n\nThe team took the lean startup approach and spun up an app directory of all\nsorts of different integrations Zapier might eventually serve \u2014 without even\nhaving a single customer. \u201cWe just thought, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ll build this little app\ndirectory, build some landing pages, see if we can get people coming in\nthrough search and then go talk to them to see if we can build the integration\nfor them. That was the style of product development we were doing at the\ntime,\u201d says Foster.\n\n### Lesson 3: When the product solves a true problem, it can withstand some\njankiness\n\nThe Zapier founders always envisioned that they were building a self-serve\nproduct (Foster notes that they were fans of Basecamp and Mailchimp, which\nboth drove traffic to a landing page where it was easy to sign up and get\nstarted). But upon signing their very first customer, they quickly realized\nthat this was far from the current reality. \u201cWe gave the customer access to\nZapier and said, \u2018Here, you can sign up and go try it out.\u2019 And he couldn\u2019t\nfigure it out, so he emails me and says, \u2018Wade, can we jump on Skype and you\ncan show me how to do this?\u2019\u201d\n\nFoster quickly fired up the video call, and watched the customer try to set up\nZapier. \u201cAnd he just clearly can\u2019t get it done. It\u2019s not even a beta at this\npoint \u2014 it\u2019s like an alpha of an alpha. There\u2019s so much jankiness in the\nproduct that I was embarrassed.\u201d\n\nThe customer was trying to get a contact form on his website (powered by\nWoofoo) and connect the folks who signed up to an AWeber email list. After an\nadmittedly painful Skype setup process, the integration worked. \u201cAnd the\ncustomer says, \u2018Wade, this has kind of changed my life.\u2019 And I remember\nthinking, this is what it actually feels like when you make something somebody\ncares about.\u201d\n\nIt was a marked difference from one of his very first experiences trying to\nsell software, as a marketing intern for a small edtech company. \u201cI was\nbrought in because the product wasn\u2019t selling, and they wanted me to figure\nout how to get more people to use it. I was learning SEO and email marketing\nand business development \u2014 just trying everything to get this product to\nsell,\u201d says Foster.\n\nAlthough he was just an intern at the time, it was a very formative experience\nfor the future founder. \u201cIt was literally how most people describe starting a\ncompany, like pushing a boulder up a hill. Why won\u2019t this thing work? The\ndesign was good, it was well-engineered and the product was slick. But it was\nultimately the classic solution in search of a problem,\u201d recalls Foster.\n\nYears later, fumbling through that painful first customer setup process, he\nwas struck by how different the feeling was with Zapier. \u201cThis product is bad,\nthe design is not great, and the guy needs hand-holding through Skype every\nstep of the way. But when we actually get to the finish line and it solves a\nproblem for him, he\u2019s asking if he can give me money. We didn\u2019t even have a\nway to take payments at that point in time,\u201d he says.\n\n> Instead of an invention problem, it became an iteration problem. And it\u2019s\n> much easier to iterate than it is to invent.\n\nThere was still a mountain of work ahead, but the seed was planted \u2014 and it\nwas a fruitful one. \u201cHow can we take this really crappy first draft and create\nsomething that someone could sign up for and get going in a self-serve way? So\nwe repeated the process over and over again. A customer would come to the\nsite, I\u2019d jump on Skype and watch them try to use it. I\u2019d take a bunch of\nnotes on where the person would fall down, and then we\u2019d do it again. And we\njust kept lather, rinse, repeating until more and more folks could get through\nthe setup process with less help,\u201d says Foster.\n\nCustomers were willing to wade through some choppy set-up waters because they\nweren\u2019t getting the problem solved anywhere else. \u201cWe knew there was demand\nfor the product because we would go on all these community forums for products\nlike Zendesk or QuickBooks and customers would be asking for integrations with\nother products. And a product manager would show up on those threads and say,\n\u2018Hey, great idea, we love what you\u2019re suggesting \u2014 we\u2019ll go consider it.\u2019\nWhich is PM speak for \u2018probably never going to happen\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s going to go on a\nbacklog somewhere that nobody\u2019s going to pay attention to,\u201d says Foster. \u201cSo\nwe knew there was clear demand for solving this integration problem.\u201d\n\n### Lesson 4: Don\u2019t hire until it hurts\n\nFoster\u2019s experience building Zapier\u2019s internal team taught him to rely on yet\nanother piece of atypical wisdom: don\u2019t rush headcount.\n\n\u201cLots of folks have said to us, \u2018You\u2019re growing, you could grow faster if you\nhired more people.\u2019 I think a lot of companies and investors overpitch growth\nat all costs, but sometimes that causes a \u2018more people more problems\u2019 issue.\u201d\n\nIt should come as no surprise by now that Foster politely said, \u201cThanks, but\nno thanks,\u201d to these well-meaning folks encouraging him to grow the team\nfaster. And he credits this slow-and-steady approach to the founders leveling\nup.\n\n\u201cIt meant we did every single job ourselves at the beginning, so we understood\nevery piece of our business. When we did eventually hire somebody in a key\nrole, that meant we knew exactly how they were going to be effective and what\nwas going to help them win. We knew what good looked like and we knew what bad\nlooked like because we had done it ourselves,\u201d he says.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that Zapier didn\u2019t grow at all, but it was a much more\nmoderate curve than is typical. \u201cWe went from three founders in the first\nyear, to seven employees in year two, then 16, then 35, and then 75. We were\nmore or less doubling every year,\u201d says Foster.\n\nHe notes that hiring with intention doesn't mean being a slow-paced\norganization. \u201cI rely on this quote from John Wooden: Be quick but don\u2019t\nhurry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou hear these stories of companies that go from 10 to 100 in a single year.\nThey hired so many folks and their whole org grinds to a halt because they\ndon't know what they're doing with these people. They're supposed to magically\ncome in and make the business grow. But that's not really how companies work.\u201d\n\n> As a first-time founder, if we had tried to grow from 10 to 100 in our first\n> year, we would have ruined a lot of stuff inside the business.\n\nHis advice for other founders is to wait to make large hiring decisions until\nthey find themselves stretched thin \u2014 and when it becomes clear where the\nbottlenecks are. Here\u2019s an example from Zapier: \u201cOne of the first issues that\nemerged was customer support. We were waking up and spending until late in the\nafternoon on calls and emails talking to customers trying to get their apps\nworking,\u201d says Foster. \u201cAt a certain point, it was like, look, we can keep\nhandholding these people along, or we can actually fix some of the underlying\nissues that are causing them to have to reach out to support in the first\nplace. And so that felt like the right time to go hire someone to help us with\ncustomer support.\u201d\n\n### Lesson 5: But bring in experienced managers earlier\n\nAs an extension of this \u201cdon\u2019t hire until it hurts\u201d philosophy, Foster notes\nthat Zapier was very hesitant in the early days to bring on anyone with\nmanagement experience (even though the founding trio themselves didn\u2019t have\nany). \u201cOur first people managers were just me, my co-founders, and early\nemployees that we promoted into those roles. We were all first-timers \u2014 some\nof us were better than others, but I would say most of us were not great.\u201d\n\nHe estimates that Zapier was probably a team of 30-40 before they hired a\nsingle person who had been a manager before at a previous company. \u201cWhich, in\nhindsight, was far too long. We would have benefited from getting one or two\nwell-rounded managers into a few functions,\u201d says Foster.\n\n> There\u2019s never been a situation where I\u2019ve regretted hiring somebody more\n> senior.\n\nWhile hiring fresh young talent and promoting from within tends to be the more\nglamorous way of doing things, don\u2019t overlook the veterans. \u201cWe probably had\nsome baggage from old gigs where we had managers who weren\u2019t great. And we\ndrew the wrong conclusions from that, which is that managers aren\u2019t all that\nuseful,\u201d he says.\n\nThis is a very common early startup trap \u2014 bringing in a management layer is\noften associated with adding layers of process (and thus, sluggishness) when\nthe goal is to move fast. This does come with a big asterisk. Founders\nshouldn\u2019t shy away from hiring senior leaders early on, but they need to make\nsure that that person is still willing to roll up their sleeves.\n\nZapier\u2019s founders flipped the script on their no-manager mentality after\nhiring their first CFO. \u201cThere was no job that was too big for her, but most\nimportantly, there was no job that was too little for her. At an early-stage\ncompany that is so killer, because you have so many jobs that are tiny,\u201d says\nFoster. \u201cI remember being a little embarrassed the first week she joined to\nask the new CFO to help book a bunch of plane flights for an upcoming retreat.\nBut she just said \u2018I got it. No biggie.\u2019 At the same time, she could think\nthrough all of our finances and present to the board \u2014 all the typical stuff\nthat you need out of a CFO. That\u2019s the magic. If you can find someone like\nthat, run towards them as fast as you can.\u201d\n\n### Lesson 6: You don\u2019t need to go enterprise to build a massive business\n\nMuch like the typical calls to raise as much as possible at the outset,\ncertain strains of startup wisdom tend to push founders down the path\ntargeting large organizations as their ICP. Makes sense, right? Longer\ncontracts, bigger checks, more opportunity...\n\nIn Foster\u2019s eyes, this one-size-fits-all thinking is outdated.\n\n\u201cAt Zapier, SMB is our bread and butter,\u201d he says. While some might call this\na missed opportunity, targeting small and medium-sized businesses is what\nFoster says makes the most sense for their product. \u201cThat\u2019s who we solve for.\nWe can see those types of customers using these products the most,\u201d he says.\n\nFoster\u2019s biggest piece of advice for finding the right target? Follow your\nnose. In other words, look at what kind of customers the product is serving,\nand focus in on what they\u2019re asking for next instead of trying to dream up a\ngrand new strategy. Maybe enterprise is where your product resonates most, but\nthe bottom line is: it doesn\u2019t have to be.\n\n\u201cWe already had customers showing up on our doorstep. And what were our\ncustomers asking us for \u2014 were they asking for enterprise software\nintegrations? Or were they asking for us to connect into yet another one of\ntheir B2B stack?\u201d he says.\n\n> If something\u2019s working, really get it working. Don\u2019t lose the momentum\n> you\u2019ve got humming just to chase the enterprise audience you think you\n> should be targeting if that isn\u2019t necessary.\n\n\u201cWe knew how to work with SMBs, versus trying to dream up some different grand\nstrategy for enterprise. Maybe we could have brought someone in who could have\nhelped us figure that piece out, but we felt like the engine we had was the\none that was working and that we wanted to scale at least for the foreseeable\nfuture,\u201d says Foster.\n\n### Lesson 7: Avoid getting caught in the roadmap rat race\n\nWhen you\u2019re in the early stages of trying to acquire customers, there can be a\nnagging feeling that you need to keep an extra close eye on the competition.\nWhere might you need to catch up?\n\nBut Foster cautions other founders and product folks from getting yanked too\nhard off their own path. \u201cIf alternatives were showing up and customers were\ntelling us about them, that\u2019s when we\u2019d start to pay attention. \u2018Tell us more\nabout that? Why do you like that? What\u2019s solving the problem for you?\u2019\u201d he\nsays. \u201cBut we rarely would go out and say, \u2018This product over here looks like\nus, but we've never heard a customer tell us that it\u2019s useful. Let\u2019s go start\nchasing and following the stuff they're doing.\u2019 That\u2019s a waste of time,\u201d says\nFoster.\n\nAs he tells it, there\u2019s a big difference between being inspired by a novel UX\nfeature and going tit-for-tat against someone else\u2019s roadmap. \u201cYou get into\nthis tricky thing where you feel like you\u2019ve got to keep up and match the\nroadmap 1-for-1. Because oftentimes you don\u2019t actually know why it is that\nthey\u2019re building that feature. What\u2019s going on behind the scenes? If they have\na different set of customers that doesn\u2019t match your own in some way, it\u2019s\ngoing to lead you astray.\u201d\n\nInstead, keep your north star tuned to what Foster calls the marginal\ncustomer. \u201cThis is the customer that could have picked you, but maybe didn\u2019t\nfor whatever reason. We really want to pay attention to that top of the funnel\n\u2014 that got 95% of our attention.\u201d\n\n### Lesson 8: Resist getting too high off your winning streak\n\nFoster is a big fan of Annie Duke, who quite literally wrote the book on\ndecision-making (we\u2019re also admirers of Duke \u2014 see our article on her\nframework here).\n\nWhat he finds most compelling from her work is the idea that good decisions\ncan breed both good and bad outcomes. Similarly, because of the unpredictable\nnature of running a business, you can make a bad decision and have it lead to\nsomething either great or terrible.\n\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t think of it that way,\u201d says Foster. \u201cThey think because\nthey make a good decision, they\u2019ll definitely get a good outcome. But that\u2019s\nnot the case, and I would take it even further than Duke by saying that a good\ndecision could yield a good outcome, a bad one or a variety of outcomes.\u201d\n\nGiven the mixed-bag nature of decision aftermath, Foster emphasizes the\nimportance of keeping yourself honest about the wins. Startup leaders should\nask themselves: Are we winning because we\u2019re making good calls? Or are we\ndoing well in spite of ourselves?\n\nThe same goes for losing: Are the losses a result of bad choices? Or is it\njust going to take a little more time?\n\n\u201cAs you go along, if your opinions get so hardened on the wrong conclusions,\nthat's going to weaken the ultimate outcome of what your company can become,\u201d\nhe says.\n\n> If you remain flexible \u2013 even in the places where you really do think you\n> got it right \u2013 and give yourself the chance to be proven incorrect, you\u2019re\n> setting yourself and your company up for success.\n\n## The Review\n\n  * Articles\n  * Collections\n  * Series\n  * Newsletter\n  * Podcast\n\n## RSS Feeds\n\n## Around the Web\n\n", "frontpage": false}
