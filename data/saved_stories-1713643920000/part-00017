Concrete balconies and bedrooms\nare discernible. But there are no windows, doors or lights. And the only\npainting is of the scatological variety from the sole residents: crows. How\nlong has it been like that? \u201cFive or six years,\u201d says the guard. Property in\nSenegal has been booming, but concrete is frequently poured into buildings\nonly for construction suddenly to stop, often for many years.\n\nHalf-made buildings are everywhere in African cities. In Abuja, Nigeria\u2019s\ncapital, the government last year said it would take over 600 of them because\nthey had been unfinished for so long.
