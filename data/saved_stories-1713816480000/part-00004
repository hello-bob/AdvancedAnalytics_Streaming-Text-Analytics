The flowers really gave it an\nextra level of charm I think.\n\nThis quote is from a comment by an upset user on my blog, replying to one of\nmy previous articles about curl.\n\nFact check: while curl is my hobby, I also work on curl as a full-time job. It\nis a business and I serve and communicate with many customers on a daily\nbasis. curl provides service to way more than a billion people. I claim that\nevery human being on the planet that is Internet-connected uses devices or\nservices every day that run curl.\n\n## The pattern\n\n## curl in San Francisco\n\nMeanwhile, another \u201ccurl craft\u201d seen in the wild recently is this ad in San\nFrancisco (photo by diego).\n\nThe full command line looks like:\n\n    \n    \n    curl --request PUT \\ --url https://api.stytch.com/v1/b2b/organizations/{ID} \\ -d '{ \"mfa_policy\": \"REQUIRED_FOR_ALL\", \"mfa_methods\": \"RESTRICTED\", \"allowed_mfa_methods\": [\"totp\", \"sms_otp\"] }'\n\nI would personally perhaps protest against the use of PUT for POSTing JSON,\nbut nobody asked me.\n\ncURL and libcurlsarcasm\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
