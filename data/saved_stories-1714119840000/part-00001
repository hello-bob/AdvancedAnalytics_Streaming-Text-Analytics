Credit: Robin Moore,\nRe:wild\n\nA study published April 25, in the journal Science provides the strongest\nevidence to date that not only is nature conservation successful, but that\nscaling conservation interventions up would be transformational for halting\nand reversing biodiversity loss\u2014a crisis that can lead to ecosystem collapses\nand a planet less able to support life\u2014and reducing the effects of climate\nchange.\n\nThe findings of this first-ever comprehensive meta-analysis of the impact of\nconservation action are crucial as more than 44,000 species are documented as\nbeing at risk of extinction, with tremendous consequences for the ecosystems\nthat stabilize the climate and that provide billions of people around the\nworld with clean water, livelihoods, homes, and cultural preservation, among\nother ecosystem services.\n\nGovernments recently adopted new global targets to halt and reverse\nbiodiversity loss, making it even more critical to understand whether\nconservation interventions are working.\n\n\"If you look only at the trend of species declines, it would be easy to think\nthat we're failing to protect biodiversity, but you would not be looking at\nthe full picture,\" said Penny Langhammer, lead author of the study and\nexecutive vice president of Re:wild.\n\n\"What we show with this paper is that conservation is, in fact, working to\nhalt and reverse biodiversity loss. It is clear that conservation must be\nprioritized and receive significant additional resources and political support\nglobally, while we simultaneously address the systemic drivers of biodiversity\nloss, such as unsustainable consumption and production.\"\n\nAlthough many studies look at individual conservation projects and\ninterventions and their impact compared with no action taken, these papers\nhave never been pulled into a single analysis to see how and whether\nconservation action is working overall.\n\nThe co-authors conducted the first-ever meta-analysis of 186 studies,\nincluding 665 trials, that looked at the impact of a wide range of\nconservation interventions globally, and over time, compared to what would\nhave happened without those interventions. The studies covered over a century\nof conservation action and evaluated actions targeting different levels of\nbiodiversity\u2014species, ecosystems and genetic diversity.\n\nThe meta-analysis found that conservation actions\u2014including the establishment\nand management of protected areas, the eradication and control of invasive\nspecies, the sustainable management of ecosystems, habitat loss reduction and\nrestoration\u2014improved the state of biodiversity or slowed its decline in the\nmajority of cases (66%) compared with no action taken at all. And when\nconservation interventions work, the paper's co-authors found that they are\nhighly effective.\n\nFor example:\n\n  * Management of invasive and problematic native predators on two of Florida's barrier islands, Cayo Costa and North Captiva, resulted in an immediate and substantial improvement in nesting success by loggerhead turtles and least terns, especially compared with other barrier islands where no predator management was applied.\n  * In the Congo Basin, deforestation was 74% lower in logging concessions under a Forest Management Plan (FMP) compared with concessions without an FMP.\n  * Protected areas and Indigenous lands were shown to significantly reduce both deforestation rate and fire density in the Brazilian Amazon. Deforestation was 1.7 to 20 times higher and human-caused fires occurred four to nine times more frequently outside the reserve perimeters compared with inside.\n  * Captive breeding and release boosted the natural population of Chinook salmon in the Salmon River basin of central Idaho with minimal negative impacts on the wild population. On average, fish taken into the hatchery produced 4.7 times more adult offspring and 1.3 times more adult second generation offspring than naturally reproducing fish.\n\nMasked Booby on Redonda Island. This species has benefited tremendously from\nthe removal of invasive predators from the island, one of the key conservation\nactions included in the meta-analysis. Credit: Robin Moore, Re:wild\n\n\"Our study shows that when conservation actions work, they really work. In\nother words, they often lead to outcomes for biodiversity that are not just a\nlittle bit better than doing nothing at all, but many times greater,\" said\nJake Bicknell, co-author of the paper and a conservation scientist at DICE,\nUniversity of Kent.\n\n\"For instance, putting measures in place to boost the population size of an\nendangered species has often seen their numbers increase substantially. This\neffect has been mirrored across a large proportion of the case studies we\nlooked at.\"\n\nEven in the minority of cases where conservation actions did not succeed in\nrecovering or slowing the decline of the species or ecosystems that they were\ntargeting compared with taking no action, conservationists benefited from the\nknowledge gained and were able to refine their methods. For example, in India\nthe physical removal of invasive algae caused the spread of the algae\nelsewhere because the process broke the algae into many pieces, enabling their\ndispersal. Conservationists could now implement a different strategy to remove\nthe algae that is more likely to be successful.\n\nThis might also explain why the co-authors found a correlation between more\nrecent conservation interventions and positive outcomes for\nbiodiversity\u2014conservation is likely getting more effective over time. Other\npotential reasons for this correlation include an increase in funding and more\ntargeted interventions.\n\nIn some other cases where the conservation action did not succeed in\nbenefiting the target biodiversity compared with no action at all, other\nnative species benefited unintentionally instead. For example, seahorse\nabundance was lower in protected sites because marine protected areas increase\nthe abundance of seahorse predators, including octopus.\n\n\"It would be too easy to lose any sense of optimism in the face of ongoing\nbiodiversity declines,\" said study co-author and Associate Professor Joseph\nBull, from the University of Oxford's department of biology. \"However, our\nresults clearly show that there is room for hope. Conservation interventions\nseemed to be an improvement on inaction most of the time; and when they were\nnot, the losses were comparatively limited.\"\n\nOne of the studies in the meta-analysis looked at a nationwide REDD+ program\nIn Guyana that reduced tree cover loss by 35%, which is equivalent to 12.8\nmillion tons of avoided carbon emissions. Credit: Andrew Snyder, Re:wild\n\nMore than half of the world's GDP, almost $44 trillion, is moderately or\nhighly dependent on nature.\n\nAccording to previous studies, a comprehensive global conservation program\nwould require an investment of between US$178 billion and US$524 billion,\nfocused primarily in countries with particularly high levels of biodiversity.\nTo put this in perspective, in 2022, global fossil fuel handouts\u2014which are\ndestructive to nature\u2014were US$7 trillion.\n\nThis is 13 times the highest amount needed annually to protect and restore the\nplanet. Today more than US$121 billion is invested annually into conservation\nworldwide, and previous studies have found the cost-benefit ratio of an\neffective global program for the conservation of the wild is at least 1:100.\n\n\"Conservation action works\u2014this is what the science clearly shows us,\" said\nClaude Gascon, co-author and director of strategy and operations at the Global\nEnvironment Facility.\n\n\"It is also evident that to ensure that positive effects last, we need to\ninvest more in nature and continue doing so in a sustained way. This study\ncomes at a critical time where the world has agreed on ambitious and needed\nglobal biodiversity targets that will require conservation action at an\nentirely new scale. Achieving this is not only possible, it is well within our\ngrasp as long as it is appropriately prioritized.\"\n\nThe paper also argues that there must be more investment specifically in the\neffective management of protected areas, which remain the cornerstone for many\nconservation actions. Consistent with other studies, this study finds that\nprotected areas work very well on the whole. And what other studies have shown\nis that when protected areas are not working, it is typically the result of a\nlack of effective management and adequate resourcing. Protected areas will be\neven more effective at reducing biodiversity loss if they are well-resourced\nand well-managed.\n\nMoving forward, the study's co-authors call for more and rigorous studies that\nlook at the impact of conservation action versus inaction for a wider range of\nconservation interventions, such as those that look at the effectiveness of\npollution control, climate change adaptation, and the sustainable use of\nspecies, and in more countries.\n\n\"For more than 75 years, IUCN has advanced the importance of sharing\nconservation practice globally,\" said Grethel Aguilar, IUCN director general.\n\n\"This paper has analyzed conservation outcomes at a level as rigorous as in\napplied disciplines like medicine and engineering\u2014showing genuine impact and\nthus guiding the transformative change needed to safeguard nature at scale\naround the world. It shows that nature conservation truly works, from the\nspecies to the ecosystem levels across all continents. This analysis, led by\nRe:wild in collaboration with many IUCN Members, Commission experts, and\nstaff, stands to usher in a new era in conservation practice.\"\n\nMore information: Penny F.
