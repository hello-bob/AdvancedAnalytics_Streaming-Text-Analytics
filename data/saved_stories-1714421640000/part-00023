This happened with multiple searches and\nwill probably get even worse as the time goes on.\n\n### Example\n\nFor example search AWS Lightsail xray, brings up this AI Answer from Pulumi as\nthe top result:Link to the AI Answer:\nhttps://www.pulumi.com/ai/answers/bLHAi4DutXJvbJyNngGRvS/optimizing-aws-\nlightsail-and-x-ray-deployment.While this might seem like a good thing for\nsomeone, spamming high ranked results that are at best misleading and at worst\ndestructive does not seem like something I would want to associate Pulumi as a\nbrand. There's already tons of generated, false content available on the\ninternet and adding even more noise to the search results is not a good idea.I\nwould highly recommend Disallow:ing robots from scraping\nhttps://www.pulumi.com/ai/answers via Robots.txt or similar functionality.\n\n### Additional context\n\nAdding -inurl:[pulumi.com/ai] to your query will remove Pulumi AI answers from\nthe search results, but it's cumbersome.\n\n### Contributing\n\nVote on this issue by adding a \ud83d\udc4d reaction.  \n---  \nThe text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered:  \n  \npetetnt added kind/bug Some behavior is incorrect or out of spec needs-triage\nNeeds attention from the triage team labels Mar 21, 2024\n\nMember\n\n###\n\nAaronFriel commented Mar 22, 2024 \u2022\n\nHey @petetnt, we've taken this feedback from you and others and we've taken\nsteps to remove more than half (almost two thirds) of AI Answers, and we plan\nto continue to ensure that these AI answers are complementary to our existing\ndocumentation.We are also taking steps to:\n\n  * Ensure our pages are grounded in the real APIs and upstream documentation\n  * Validating the results, e.g.: via type checking and testing the generated code\n\n  \n---  \n  \nAaronFriel removed the needs-triage Needs attention from the triage team label\nMar 22, 2024\n\nAaronFriel assigned AaronFriel and interurban Mar 22, 2024\n\nMember\n\n###\n\ncnunciato commented Mar 22, 2024\n\n> we've taken steps to remove more than half of AI Answers\n\nWorth mentioning this list was submitted to Google this morning, so it could\nbe a bit before they're removed from search results. We expect this to happen\nfairly soon, though.  \n---  \n  \nAuthor\n\n###\n\npetetnt commented Mar 22, 2024\n\nThank you @AaronFriel and @cnunciato for the prompt (sic) and solid response \ud83e\udee1  \n---  \n  \npetetnt closed this as completed Mar 22, 2024\n\npetetnt reopened this Apr 29, 2024\n\nAuthor\n\n###\n\npetetnt commented Apr 29, 2024\n\nThis was trending on my Twitter feed today, so it's pretty safe to assume that\nthe situation is dire still\nhttps://twitter.com/ProgrammerDude/status/1784833971731223033  \n---  \n  \nSign up for free to join this conversation on GitHub.
