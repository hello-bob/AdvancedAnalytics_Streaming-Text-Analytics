But put them on ice and they don\u2019t forget \u2014 until\nthey are returned to room temperature, a study finds^1.\n\nThe worms, the laboratory workhorse Caenorhabditis elegans, only retain their\nmemories if they\u2019re cooled quickly. If they are allowed to acclimatize to the\ncold by spending the night in cool conditions before they are trained and\nplaced on ice, they forget the information as fast as usual. If they are given\nthe drug lithium, they also hang onto their memories for longer than normal,\neven at room temperature.\n\nThe work speaks to the mysteries of how memories are made and discarded. It\nalso raises questions about why the keenness of a worm\u2019s memories changes\nunder different environmental conditions.\n\nThe research is \u201cterrific\u201d, says molecular biologist Ilya Ruvinsky at\nNorthwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, who was not involved in the\nresearch. \u201cForming memories is an intrinsically interesting problem. But it\ndoesn\u2019t happen in isolation.\u201d\n\nThe research was led by geneticist Oded Rechavi at Tel Aviv University in\nIsrael and posted on the preprint server bioRxiv on 3 April. It has not yet\nbeen peer reviewed.\n\n## Worms on ice\n\nYou can\u2019t just ask a worm if it remembers something. To get around this,\nscientists train a worm to dislike a smell it would normally like by exposing\nthe worm to that smell as it endures a short period of starvation. Two hours\nafter learning to dislike the odour, the worm has forgotten the negative\nassociation and is once again attracted to the smell.\n\nUnpicking the link between smell and memories\n\nTo study memory formation, Rechavi\u2019s then-graduate student Dana Landschaft\nBerliner put worms on ice. She found that the animals retained their smell-\nrelated memories while chilled for at least 16 hours. As soon as the creatures\nwere taken off the ice, however, their memory \u2018clock\u2019 seemed to restart; after\nthree hours, they had forgotten their aversion to the smell.\n\nBerliner identified several ways to affect worm memory. When the worms were\ncooled overnight before the memory training, they quickly forgot the odour, as\nusual. Worms given lithium and then put on ice held onto their memories just\nlike counterparts that hadn\u2019t received lithium. But worms given lithium also\nretained their memories at room temperature, whereas unmedicated animals did\nnot.\n\n## \u2018Forgetting switch\u2019\n\nThe key to these responses might be a signalling molecule called\ndiacylglycerol. In C. elegans, it is known to regulate cellular processes\nrelated to memory and learning, and to be essential for smell-related\nlearning.\n\nIn both the ice and lithium treatments, memory preservation was linked to\nreduced levels of diacylglycerol, the authors found. The team dubbed the\ndiacylglycerol circuit the \u201cforgetting switch\u201d because of its involvement in\ndelaying memory loss.\n\nThe connection between low diacylglycerol levels and lithium makes sense:\nlithium is known to inhibit an enzyme that makes a precursor to\ndiacylglycerol. This is considered to underlie lithium\u2019s effect in people with\nbipolar disorder, Rechavi says.\n\nThe scientists also found that memory retention is related to cell-membrane\nrigidity, which increases in the cold. Two strains of mutant worm that have\nunusually rigid membranes were slower than normal worms to forget, even at\nroom temperature. Physical hardening of the membrane seems to delay\nforgetting, the experiments showed.\n\n## Why forget?\n\nAs for the future, this research raises interesting questions on many levels:\nmolecular, biochemical, genetic and evolutionary, says Rechavi. \u201cWhy do they\nforget, when the worms are perfectly capable of maintaining the memories\nlonger?\u201d He asks. \u201cIs it because they\u2019re optimizing for something? Perhaps\nthere\u2019s a reason for holding memories for the particular duration that they\ndo.\u201d And do these trade-offs occur in other animals?\n\nRechavi\u2019s lab is currently investigating whether similar memory phenomena\nhappen in other organisms that can survive cold temperatures, such as tiny\nanimals called tardigrades and certain turtle species. \u201cIt will keep us busy\nfor a long time,\u201d he says.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01130-4\n\n## References\n\n  1.
