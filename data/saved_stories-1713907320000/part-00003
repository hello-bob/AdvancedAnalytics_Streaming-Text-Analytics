Santiago/Getty Images)\n\nIncreasing shares of U.S. adults are turning to the short-form video sharing\nplatform TikTok in general and for news.\n\nHow we did this\n\nPew Research Center conducted this analysis to better understand Americans\u2019\nuse and perceptions of TikTok. The data for this analysis comes from several\nCenter surveys conducted in 2023.\n\nMore information about the surveys and their methodologies, including the\nsample sizes and field dates, can be found at the links in the text.\n\nPew Research Center is a subsidiary of The Pew Charitable Trusts, its primary\nfunder. This is the latest analysis in Pew Research Center\u2019s ongoing\ninvestigation of the state of news, information and journalism in the digital\nage, a research program funded by The Pew Charitable Trusts, with generous\nsupport from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.\n\nExplore Americans\u2019 social media habits and attitudes\n\nThis analysis draws from several Pew Research Center reports on Americans\u2019 use\nof and attitudes about social media, based on surveys conducted in 2023. For\nmore information, read:\n\n  * Americans\u2019 Social Media Use\n  * How U.S. Adults Use TikTok\n  * Social Media and News Fact Sheet\n  * Teens, Social Media and Technology 2023\n\nAt the same time, some Americans have concerns about the Chinese-owned\nplatform\u2019s approach to data privacy and its potential impact on national\nsecurity. Lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives recently passed a\nbill that, if passed in the Senate and signed into law, would restrict\nTikTok\u2019s ability to operate in the United States.\n\nHere are six key facts about Americans and TikTok, drawn from Pew Research\nCenter surveys.\n\nA third of U.S. adults \u2013 including a majority of adults under 30 \u2013 use TikTok.\nAround six-in-ten U.S. adults under 30 (62%) say they use TikTok, compared\nwith 39% of those ages 30 to 49, 24% of those 50 to 64, and 10% of those 65\nand older.\n\nIn a 2023 Center survey, TikTok stood out from other platforms we asked about\nfor the rapid growth of its user base. Just two years earlier, 21% of U.S.\nadults used the platform.\n\nA majority of U.S. teens use TikTok. About six-in-ten teens ages 13 to 17\n(63%) say they use the platform. More than half of teens (58%) use it daily,\nincluding 17% who say they\u2019re on it \u201calmost constantly.\u201d\n\nA higher share of teen girls than teen boys say they use TikTok almost\nconstantly (22% vs. 12%). Hispanic teens also stand out: Around a third (32%)\nsay they\u2019re on TikTok almost constantly, compared with 20% of Black teens and\n10% of White teens.\n\nIn fall 2023, support for a U.S. TikTok ban had declined. Around four-in-ten\nAmericans (38%) said that they would support the U.S. government banning\nTikTok, down from 50% in March 2023. A slightly smaller share (27%) said they\nwould oppose a ban, while 35% were not sure. This question was asked before\nthe House of Representatives passed the bill that could ban the app.\n\nRepublicans and Republican-leaning independents were far more likely than\nDemocrats and Democratic leaners to support a TikTok ban (50% vs. 29%), but\nsupport had declined across both parties since earlier in the year.\n\nAdults under 30 were less likely to support a ban than their older\ncounterparts. About three-in-ten adults under 30 (29%) supported a ban,\ncompared with 36% of those ages 30 to 49, 39% of those ages 50 to 64, and 49%\nof those ages 65 and older.\n\nIn a separate fall 2023 survey, only 18% of U.S. teens said they supported a\nban.\n\nA relatively small share of users produce most of TikTok\u2019s content. About half\nof U.S. adult TikTok users (52%) have ever posted a video on the platform. In\nfact, of all the TikTok content posted by American adults, 98% of publicly\naccessible videos come from the most active 25% of users.\n\nThose who have posted TikTok content are more active on the site overall.\nThese users follow more accounts, have more followers and are more likely to\nhave filled out an account bio.\n\nAlthough younger U.S. adults are more likely to use TikTok, their posting\nbehaviors don\u2019t look much different from those of older age groups.\n\nAbout four-in-ten U.S. TikTok users (43%) say they regularly get news there.\nWhile news consumption on other social media sites has declined or remained\nstagnant in recent years, the share of U.S. TikTok users who get news on the\nsite has doubled since 2020, when 22% got news there.\n\nRelated: Social Media and News Fact Sheet\n\nTikTok news consumers are especially likely to be:\n\n  * Young. The vast majority of U.S. adults who regularly get news on TikTok are under 50: 44% are ages 18 to 29 and 38% are 30 to 49. Just 4% of TikTok news consumers are ages 65 and older.\n  * Women. A majority of regular TikTok news consumers in the U.S. are women (58%), while 39% are men. These gender differences are similar to those among news consumers on Instagram and Facebook.\n  * Democrats. Six-in-ten regular news consumers on TikTok are Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents, while a third are Republicans or GOP leaners.\n  * Hispanic or Black. Three-in-ten regular TikTok news users in the U.S. are Hispanic, while 19% are Black. Both shares are higher than these groups\u2019 share of the adult population. Around four-in-ten (39%) TikTok news consumers are White, although this group makes up 59% of U.S. adults overall.\n\nA majority of Americans (59%) see TikTok as a major or minor threat to U.S.\nnational security, including 29% who see the app as a major threat. Our May\n2023 survey also found that opinions vary across several groups:\n\n  * About four-in-ten Republicans (41%) see TikTok as a major threat to national security, compared with 19% of Democrats.\n  * Older adults are more likely to see TikTok as a major threat: 46% of Americans ages 65 and older say this, compared with 13% of those ages 18 to 29.\n  * U.S. adults who do not use TikTok are far more likely than TikTok users to believe TikTok is a major threat (36% vs. 9%).\n\nTopics\n\n  * TikTok\n\nShare This Link:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Mail\n\nKirsten Eddy is a senior researcher focusing on news and information at Pew\nResearch Center\n\nbiobio\n\nPostsPosts\n\nEmail\n\n### Related\n\nshort readMar 22, 2024\n\n## WhatsApp and Facebook dominate the social media landscape in middle-income\nnations\n\nreportFeb 22, 2024\n\n## How U.S. Adults Use TikTok\n\nreportJan 31, 2024\n\n## Americans\u2019 Social Media Use\n\nreportJan 5, 2024\n\n## Teens and Social Media Fact Sheet\n\nshort readDec 11, 2023\n\n## A declining share of adults, and few teens, support a U.S. TikTok ban\n\n### TOPICS\n\n  * TikTok\n\n### Most Popular\n\n1\n\nWhat\u2019s It Like To Be a Teacher in America Today?\n\n2\n\nThe Hardships and Dreams of Asian Americans Living in Poverty\n\n3\n\n81% of U.S. adults \u2013 versus 46% of teens \u2013 favor parental consent for minors\nto use social media\n\n4\n\nChanging Partisan Coalitions in a Politically Divided Nation\n\n5\n\nAmericans\u2019 use of ChatGPT is ticking up, but few trust its election\ninformation\n\n1615 L St. NW, Suite 800 Washington, DC 20036 USA (+1) 202-419-4300 | Main (+1) 202-857-8562 | Fax (+1) 202-419-4372 | Media Inquiries\n\n#### Research Topics\n\n  * Age & Generations\n  * Coronavirus (COVID-19)\n  * Economy & Work\n  * Family & Relationships\n  * Gender & LGBTQ\n  * Immigration & Migration\n  * International Affairs\n  * Internet & Technology\n  * Methodological Research\n  * News Habits & Media\n  * Non-U.S. Governments\n  * Other Topics\n  * Politics & Policy\n  * Race & Ethnicity\n  * Religion\n  * Science\n\n#### Follow Us\n\n  * Email Newsletters\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Tumblr\n  * YouTube\n  * RSS Feed\n\nABOUT PEW RESEARCH CENTER Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan fact tank that\ninforms the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world.\nIt conducts public opinion polling, demographic research, media content\nanalysis and other empirical social science research.
