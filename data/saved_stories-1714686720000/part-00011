The design shows on both sides (front and\nreverse). The embroidery artists skillfully hide all the loose threads and\nknots. Such a piece is normally mounted on a wooden frame as a screen. One\nreally can't tell which side is the front or the back.\n\nThe embroidery artists always works on the same side of the background, even\nthough the picture on the other side may be entirely different. She must keep\nboth images in her mind, which requires intense concentration. When\nembroidering areas that are the same color on both sides, the artist uses one\nthreaded needle to do both sides at once. When embroidering areas that are\ndifferently colored on each side, the artist uses two needles threaded with\ndifferent colors. She holds down satin stitches on the upper side with\ncouching stitches from the underside. The couching stitches are not visible on\nthe upper side because the thread is so fine. On the underside, the thread\nmakes satin stitches as it travels from couching stitch to couching stitch.\nThe result: parallel satin stitches on top and bottom in two different colors.\n\nGenerally double sided embroidery works can be divided into two groups based\non the size of the embroidery work.\n\n1, Small size double sided embroideries. Small size double sided embroideries\nare used for desk decoration. The embroidery size is around 16 x 25 cm, or 6 x\n10 inches. The embroideries are often seen in three shapes, circle, rectangle\nand traditional Chinese fan. The round embroidery and rectangle embroidery are\nrotatable. By rotating the embroidery, you can see the embroidery work on both\nsides.\n\nWe noticed that there are many round double-sided embroidery fan without glass\nfor sale on some platforms at an incredibly low pricing.

Large size double sided embroideries\nare used for both dividing a room and decorating the house. They are put on\nthe floor. Some people call them silk embroidery floor screens. Different\nlarge size embroideries can be made according to the space of the owner's\nroom. From their shapes, they can be grouped into two types, one panel\nembroidery floor screen and multi-panel embroidery floor screen.\n\nIn terms of embroidery techniques and skills, the double sided embroidery can\nbe classified as three types, double sided embroidery with exactly the same\npattern on both sides, double sided embroidery with the same pattern but\ndifferent colors and double sided embroidery with two different patterns.
