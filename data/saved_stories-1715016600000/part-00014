His expertise lies in identifying\nthe latest technological trends, dissecting complex topics, and weaving\ncompelling narratives around the most cutting-edge developments. His articles\nand interviews with leading industry figures have gained him recognition as a\nkey influencer by organisations such as Onalytica. Publications under his\nstewardship have since gained recognition from leading analyst houses like\nForrester for their performance. Find him on X (@gadget_ry) or Mastodon\n(@gadgetry@techhub.social)\n\nAs the world embraces the transformative potential of AI, SoftServe is at the\nforefront of developing cutting-edge AI solutions while prioritising\nresponsible deployment.\n\nAhead of AI & Big Data Expo North America \u2013 where the company will showcase\nits expertise \u2013 Chuck Ros, Industry Success Director at SoftServe, provided\nvaluable insights into the company\u2019s AI initiatives, the challenges faced, and\nits future strategy for leveraging this powerful technology.\n\nHighlighting a recent AI project that exemplifies SoftServe\u2019s innovative\napproach, Ros discussed the company\u2019s unique solution for a software company\nin the field service management industry. The vision was to create an easy-to-\nuse, language model-enabled interface that would allow field technicians to\naccess service histories, equipment documentation, and maintenance schedules\nseamlessly, enhancing productivity and operational efficiency.\n\n\u201cOur AI engineers built a prompt evaluation pipeline that seamlessly considers\ncost, processing time, semantic similarity, and the likelihood of\nhallucinations,\u201d Ros explained. \u201cIt proved to be an extremely effective\narchitecture that led to improved operational efficiencies for the customer,\nincreased productivity for users in the field, competitive edge for the\nsoftware company and for their clients, and\u2014perhaps most importantly\u2014a spark\nfor additional innovation.\u201d\n\nWhile the potential of AI is undeniable, Ros acknowledged the key mistakes\nbusinesses often make when deploying AI solutions, emphasising the importance\nof having a robust data strategy, building adequate data pipelines, and\nthoroughly testing the models. He also cautioned against rushing to deploy\ngenerative AI solutions without properly assessing feasibility and business\nviability, stating, \u201cWe need to pay at least as much attention to whether it\nshould be built as we do to whether it can be built.\u201d\n\nRecognising the critical concern of ethical AI development, Ros stressed the\nsignificance of human oversight throughout the entire process. \u201cManaging\ndynamic data quality, testing and detecting for bias and inaccuracies,\nensuring high standards of data privacy, and ethical use of AI systems all\nrequire human oversight,\u201d he said. SoftServe\u2019s approach to AI development\ninvolves structured engagements that evaluate data and algorithms for\nsuitability, assess potential risks, and implement governance measures to\nensure accountability and data traceability.\n\nLooking ahead, Ros envisions AI playing an increasingly vital role in\nSoftServe\u2019s business strategy, with ongoing refinements to AI-assisted\nsoftware development lifecycles and the introduction of new tools and\nprocesses to boost productivity further. Softserve\u2019s findings suggest that\nGenAI can accelerate programming productivity by as much as 40 percent.\n\n\u201cI see more models assisting us on a daily basis, helping us write emails and\ndocumentation and helping us more and more with the simple, time-consuming\nmundane tasks we still do,\u201d Ros said. \u201cIn the next five years I see ongoing\nrefinement of that view to AI in SDLCs and the regular introduction of new\ntools, new models, new processes that push that 40 percent productivity hike\nto 50 percent and 60 percent.\u201d\n\nWhen asked how SoftServe is leveraging AI for social good, Ros explained the\ncompany is delivering solutions ranging from machine learning models to help\nstudents discover their passions and aptitudes, enabling personalised learning\nexperiences, to assisting teachers in their daily tasks and making their jobs\neasier.\n\n\u201cI love this question because one of SoftServe\u2019s key strategic tenets is to\npower our social purpose and make the world a better place. It\u2019s obviously an\nambitious goal, but it\u2019s important to our employees and it\u2019s important to our\nclients,\u201d explained Ros.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s why we created the Open Eyes Foundation and have collected more than $15\nmillion with the support of the public, our clients, our partners, and of\ncourse our employees. We naturally support the Open Eyes Foundation with all\nmanner of technology needs, including AI.\u201d\n\nAt the AI & Big Data Expo North America, SoftServe plans to host a keynote\npresentation titled \u201cRevolutionizing Learning: Unleashing the Power of\nGenerative AI in Education and Beyond,\u201d which will explore the transformative\nimpact of generative AI and large language models in the education sector.\n\n\u201cAs we explore the mechanisms through which generative AI leverages data \u2013\nincluding training methodologies like fine-tuning and Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) \u2013 we will pinpoint high-value, low-risk applications that\npromise to redefine the educational landscape,\u201d said Ros.\n\n\u201cThe journey from a nascent idea to a fully operational AI solution is fraught\nwith challenges, including ethical considerations and risks inherent in\ndeploying AI solutions. Through the lens of a success story at Mesquite ISD,\nwhere generative AI was leveraged to help students uncover their passions and\naptitudes enabling the delivery of personalised learning experiences, this\npresentation will illustrate the practical benefits and transformative\npotential of generative AI in education.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the company will participate in panel discussions on topics such\nas \u201cGetting to Production-Ready \u2013 Challenges and Best Practices for Deploying\nAI\u201d and \u201cNavigating the Data & AI Landscape \u2013 Ensuring Safety, Security, and\nResponsibility in Big Data and AI Systems.\u201d These sessions will provide\nattendees with valuable insights from SoftServe\u2019s experts on overcoming\ndeployment challenges, ensuring data quality and user acceptance, and\nmitigating risks associated with AI implementation.\n\nAs a key sponsor of the event, SoftServe aims to contribute to the discourse\nsurrounding the responsible and ethical development of AI solutions, while\nsharing its expertise and vision for leveraging this powerful technology to\ndrive innovation, enhance productivity, and address global challenges.\n\n\u201cWe are, of course, always interested in both sharing and hearing about the\ndiversity of business cases for applications in AI and big data: the concept\nof the rising tide lifting all boats is definitely relevant in AI and GenAI in\nparticular, and we\u2019re proud to be a part of the AI technology community,\u201d Ros\nconcludes.\n\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?
