They apply principles used in organizing\ncommunities developing open-source software for organizing group efforts\ninnovating with human culture. New open-source religions may develop their\nrituals, praxes, or systems of beliefs through a continuous process of\nrefinement and dialogue among participating practitioners. Organizers and\nparticipants often see themselves as part of a more generalized open-source\nand free-culture movement.^[2]\n\n## Origin[edit]\n\nIn 1994, with his essay, \"The Holy War: Mac vs. DOS,\" the scholar and novelist\nUmberto Eco popularized the use of religious metaphors in comparing operating\nsystem design and user experience.^[3] By the late 1990s, the term \"open-\nsource religion\" began appearing in technology magazines as a reference to the\nopen-source Linux operating system's organizing principle and as an analogy\nfor highlighting the philosophical differences between advocates of open-\nsource vs. proprietary software.^[4]^[5] In 2001, Daniel Kriegman began\ndescribing a religion he invented called Ozacua (later Yoism) as \"the world's\nfirst opensource religion.\"^[6]^[7] The concept of an \"open source religion\"\nwas further expanded upon by the media theorist, Douglas Rushkoff in his book,\nNothing's Sacred: The Truth about Judaism (2003), where he offered the\nfollowing description as an introduction to Open Source Judaism:\n\n    An open source religion would work the same way as open source software development: it is not kept secret or mysterious at all. Everyone contributes to the codes we use to comprehend our place in the universe. We allow our religion to evolve based on the active participation of its people....An open source relationship to religion would likewise take advantage of the individual points of view of its many active participants to develop its more resolved picture of the world and our place within it.^[8]\n\n### Discordianism, Copyleft, and open-source software[edit]\n\nPage of the Principia Discordia that includes the following Copyright\ndisclaimer, \"K ALL RIGHTS REVERSED \u2013 Reprint what you like,\" the earliest\nexample of what would become a declaration of copyleft.Discordian reference to\nthe mythological Kallisti, or Apple of Discord, as an all rights reversed\nsymbol.\n\nBefore the coinage of the term open-source in 1998 or even the birth of the\nFree Software movement, the Principia Discordia, a Discordian religious text\nwritten by Greg Hill with Kerry Wendell Thornley, included the following\nCopyright disclaimer in its 4th edition (1970), \"K ALL RIGHTS REVERSED \u2013\nReprint what you like.\" By the summer of 1970, the implications of the\ndisclaimer were being discussed in other underground publications.^[9]\n\n    Commercial publishers are not likely to be interested in the Principia due, at least, to the counter copyright on it\u2013for, if they had a good seller, then other publishers could print it out from under them. Consequently publication and distribution will have to occur spontaneously, thru the \u201cunderground\u201d, as alternative cultures learn to meet their own needs and provide their own services. This non-commercial limitation of the Principia is to provide less limitations in other respects, and it is not an accident. The Principia is not simply a handbook, it is a demonstration.^[10]\n\nVia the counterculture, by the mid-1970s, the concept had influenced a\ngeneration of Discordians including the nascent hacker culture.^[11] The\nproject to create Tiny BASIC was proposed in Bob Albrecht and Dennis Allison's\nDr. Dobb's Journal of Tiny BASIC Calisthenics & Orthodontia, a journal of the\nHomebrew Computer Club, a small group of computer hobbyists who began meeting\nin 1975 around Silicon Valley. The first lines of the source code for Tiny\nBasic as released in 1976 by Li-Chen Wang stated \u2018(\u2184) COPYLEFT ALL WRONGS\nRESERVED\u2019. In 1984\u20135 programmer Don Hopkins sent Richard Stallman a letter\nlabeled \"Copyleft\u2014all rights reversed\". Stallman chose the phrase to identify\nhis free software method of distribution.^[12] The relationship between\nDiscordianism and \"Kopyleft\" remain part of the culture of Discordianism, as\nexplained by the Discordian Rev. Dr. Jon Swabey in his Apocrypha Discordia.\n\n    Discordianism and the concept of KopyLeft go hand in hand. Although just a small part of the counter-culture gestalt, I believe that the Principia Discordia was probably one of the earliest expressions and strongest champions of this idea, which has since seen such concepts as the Open Source Software initiative, with endeavours such as the Linux Operating System.\u201d^[13]\n\n## Open-source in established religious traditions[edit]\n\nFor established traditions whose canonical works, records of discourse, and\ninspired artworks reside in the public domain, keeping these works open and\navailable in the face of proprietary interests has inspired several open-\nsource initiatives. Open access to resources and adaptive reuse of shared\nmaterials under open content licensing provide a structure by which\ncommunities can innovate new religious systems collaboratively under the aegis\nof copyright law. For some religious movements, however, public access and\nliteracy, and the potential of adaptive reuse also provide an opportunity for\ninnovation and reform within established traditions. In an interview by Alan\nJacobs in The Atlantic magazine on open-source religion, Aharon Varady\n(founding director of the Open Siddur Project) explained that \"cultures\nbreathe creativity like we breathe oxygen\" arguing that open-source provides\none possible strategy for keeping a tradition vibrant while also preserving\nhistorical works as non-proprietary during a period of transition from analog\nto digital media.^[14]\n\n### Open-source Judaism[edit]\n\nAlthough a work of radical 1960s Jewish counterculture rather than an\nexplicitly religious work, the satirical songbook Listen to the mocking bird\n(Times Change Press, 1971) by the Fugs' Naphtali \"Tuli\" Kupferberg contains\nthe earliest explicit mention of \"copyleft\" in a copyright disclaimer.^[15]\nLater open-source efforts in Judaism begin to appear in 1988 with the free\nsoftware code written for calculating the Hebrew calendar included in Emacs.\nAfter the popularization of the term \"open-source\" in 1998, essays and\nmanifestos linking open-source and Judaism began appearing in 2002 among\nJewish thinkers familiar with trends in new media and open-source software. In\nAugust 2002, Aharon Varady proposed the formation of an \"Open Siddur,\" an\nopen-source licensed user-generated content project for digitizing liturgical\nmaterials and writing the code needed for the web-to-print publishing of\nSiddurim (Jewish prayer books).^[16] Meanwhile, media theorist Douglas\nRushkoff began articulating his understanding of open-source in Judaism. \"The\nobject of the game, for me,\" Rushkoff explained, \"was to recontextualize\nJudaism as an entirely Open Source proposition.\"^[17]\n\nOpen-Source Judaism logo\n\nThe term \"Open Source Judaism\" first appeared in Douglas Rushkoff's book\nNothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism (2003). Rushkoff employed the term\n\"Open Source\" to describe a democratic organizational model for collaborating\nin a commonly held source: the Hebrew Bible and other essential works of\nRabbinic Judaism. Rushkoff conceived of Judaism as essentially an open-source\nreligion which he conceived as, \"the contention that religion is not a pre-\nexisting truth but an ongoing project. It may be divinely inspired, but it is\na creation of human beings working together. A collaboration.\"^[18] For\nRushkoff, open-source offered the promise of enacting change through a new\nculture of collaboration and improved access to sources. \"Anyone who wants to\ndo Judaism should have access to Judaism. Judaism is not just something that\nyou do, it's something you enact. You've got to learn the code in order to\nalter it.\"^[19] The 2003 publication of Rushkoff's book Nothing Sacred: The\nTruth about Judaism^[20] and an online forum dedicated to \"Open Source\nJudaism\" inspired several online projects in creating web applications for\ngenerating custom made haggadot for Passover, however neither content nor code\nfor these were shared under free-culture compatible open content terms.\n\nBeginning with the Open Siddur Project in 2009, open-source projects in\nJudaism began to publicly share their software code with open-source licenses\nand their content with free-culture compatible open content licenses. The\nexplicit objectives of these projects also began to differ from Rushkoff's\n\"Open Source Judaism.\" Rather than seek reforms in religious practices or\ndoctrines, these projects used Open Content licenses to empower users to\naccess and create their own resources from a common store of canonical texts\nand associated translations and metadata. By 2012, open-source projects in\nJudaism were mainly active in facilitating collaboration in sharing resources\nfor transcribing and translating existing works in the Public Domain, and for\nadaptation and dissemination of works being shared by copyright owners under\nOpen Content licenses.^[14]\n\n### Open-source Yoga[edit]\n\nFollowing proprietary claims on Yoga movements by some Yoga instructors, Open\nSource Yoga Unity was formed in 2003 to assert that Yoga movements reside in\nthe public domain. The organization provides a common voice, and the pooling\nof resources, to legally resist the application of a proprietary Copyright to\nany Yoga style thereby \"ensuring its continued natural unfettered practice for\nall to enjoy and develop.\" The organization explains, that \"while we\nappreciate the teachings of yoga teachers, we do not believe that they have\nthe legal right to impose control over another's Yoga teaching or\npractice.\"^[21] In Open Source Yoga Unity v. Bikram Choudhury (2005), the\norganization settled out of court, avoiding a federal court hearing to\ndetermine whether Bikram Choudhury's copyrighted sequence of 26 poses and two\nbreathing exercises could be legally protected.^[22]\n\n### Open-source Wicca[edit]\n\nConcerned with the lack of a source text containing documentation on Wicca in\nthe tradition of Gerald Gardner, Dr. Leo Ruickbie self-published Open Source\nWicca: The Gardnerian Tradition (2007) for \"putting you back in control of\nspirituality.\" The work, a collection of \"the original foundation documents of\nWicca\" authored between 1949 and 1961, was published digitally and in print\nunder a Creative Commons Attribution license.^[23]\n\n## Open-source in establishing new religions[edit]\n\nSeveral projects aiding individuals and communities in formulating their own\nbelief systems cite inspiration from ideas common to the open-source movement\nand self-identify as open-source religions or religious initiatives. The\nestablishment of new religions through open-source methods is closely related\nto chaos magic, which emphasizes the pragmatic use of belief systems and the\ncreation of new and unorthodox methods,^[24] the difference being that any\nknowledge gained through such innovation is shared openly.^[25]\n\n### Yoism[edit]\n\nYoism\n\nAccording to one founder, Daniel Kriegman, Yoism (founded 1994) combines\nrational inquiry, empiricism, and science with Spinozan or Einsteinian\npantheism.^[26]^[27]^[28] Inspired by the Linux operating system, Kriegman\ndescribes his religion as \"open-source\" and explains that, similar to open-\nsource software projects, participants in Yoism do not owe their allegiance to\nany leader and that their sense of authority emerges via group consensus\ndecision-making.^[1]^[29]^[30] Yoism adopted the Creative Commons Attribution-\nShareAlike copyleft license for sharing original works in May 2015.^[31]\n\n### Human Worship[edit]\n\nHuman Worship, or Open Religion, is an \"eternal tradition of considering Human\nabsolute, highest value\", \"considering God as Human continuation to infinity\nthrough Soul\", described in its sacred book, shared in public domain by the\nformula \"All rights reserved for God. Open Soul Holy Scripture of Human\nWorship is word of God, common heritage of Humankind, published anonymously,\nfree for copying\".^[32] The blessing gesture and sacred sign of Open Religion\nis the circle or zero, with the human in the center of coordinates. Human\nWorshippers bow to every human soul, laying the hand on heart and saying\n\"Believe in yourself!\". They organize \"soul societies\" for missionary work,\nfriendship, love and common joy. Also they believe in every human having the\ncapacity to be a prophet, every human action to be prayer and all consequences\nas revelation from God, claiming that practical experience inspires true faith\nand skeptics are the same holy persons as prophets.\n\n### Dudeism[edit]\n\nDudeism is a religion based mainly on Taoism and Epicureanism, but which uses\nthe film The Big Lebowski as its primary liturgical vehicle. It has no strict\ndoctrine and instead invites its ministers and followers to help decide its\ntenets. Its founder has frequently referred to Dudeism as an \"open-source\nreligion\".^[33]^[34]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Missionary Church of Kopimism\n  * Arts & Crafts Movement and DIY ethic\n  * Chaos magic\n  * The Commons\n  * Copyright\n  * Crowdsourcing and User generated content\n  * Cybersectarianism\n  * Free content and Open content\n  * Free Culture Movement\n  * Gratis vs. Libre (free without payment vs. freedom for reuse)\n  * License compatibility\n  * Open Source Licensing and Open Source History\n  * Public Domain\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Charles Piller (2006-07-23). \"Divine Inspiration From the Masses\".
