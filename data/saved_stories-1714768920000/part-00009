This means you can run virtual\nmachines within other VMs, opening up new possibilities for testing and\ndevelopment environments. With nested virtualization, you can now run even\nmore complex configurations, including HP Sure Click, enabling heightened\nsecurity within virtualized environments.\n\n## Why Nested Virtualization\n\nIncreasingly, virtualization is an expected feature for a wide variety of\nscenarios. This creates the situation that a system is both likely to run in a\nvirtual environment and that it needs virtualization for its core functions.\n\nAn example is HP Sure Click, a solution that isolates security-critical\nsoftware, such as web browsers and e-mail clients, from the user\u2019s normal\nenvironment. HP Sure Click uses virtualization to create so called micro-VMs\nto safely contain potentially malicious software.\n\nA virtualization solution needs to support nested virtualization to allow\nsoftware, such as HP Sure Click, to run in a virtual machine as well. With the\npopularity of virtual desktops, nested virtualization is crucial to offer the\nsame security features to virtual desktop users as are offered for users of\nnormal unvirtualized systems.\n\nTogether with fast graphics, nested virtualization is another puzzle piece to\noffer a modern desktop experience to users.\n\n## Available Now\n\nNested virtualization support for Intel systems is available today in our KVM\nBackend for VirtualBox. Follow the build instructions in the Github\nrepository. Don\u2019t forget to enable nested virtualization as described in the\nREADME to try it out.\n\n## What\u2019s next?\n\nBesides HP Sure Click in Windows, we have successfully tested Qemu/KVM running\nUbuntu Linux inside of Ubuntu Linux and are continuously testing more\ncombinations.\n\nWhile implementing this feature, we encountered and resolved a complex issue\nthat was causing Windows guests to blue-screen during bootup. The story behind\nit will be explained in another blog article.
