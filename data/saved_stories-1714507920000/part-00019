Therefore, it is natural to attract lots of interest\n> from academic and industry researchers. Up to the present, a great variety\n> of Transformer variants (a.k.a. X-formers) have been proposed, however, a\n> systematic and comprehensive literature review on these Transformer variants\n> is still missing. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of\n> various X-formers. We first briefly introduce the vanilla Transformer and\n> then propose a new taxonomy of X-formers. Next, we introduce the various\n> X-formers from three perspectives: architectural modification, pre-training,\n> and applications. Finally, we outline some potential directions for future\n> research.\n\nSubjects:| Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI);\nComputation and Language (cs.CL)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2106.04554 [cs.LG]  \n(or arXiv:2106.04554v2 [cs.LG] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2106.04554arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Tianyang Lin [view email] [v1] Tue, 8 Jun 2021 17:43:08 UTC (2,326 KB)\n[v2] Tue, 15 Jun 2021 07:56:19 UTC (2,325 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled A Survey of Transformers, by Tianyang Lin and 3\nother authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.LG\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2106\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI cs.CL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\n### 3 blog links\n\n(what is this?)\n\n### DBLP - CS Bibliography\n\nlisting | bibtex\n\nYuxin Wang Xiangyang Liu Xipeng Qiu\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\nIArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
