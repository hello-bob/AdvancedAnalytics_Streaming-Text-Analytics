(Taking a break from Mastodon)\n\nApril 4, 2024March 17, 2024\n\nI\u2019m closing up shop on my Mastodon for the foreseeable future.\n\nI have for the most part very much enjoyed my experience on the Fediverse, and\nexperts say that Mastodon is one of the components of the Fediverse.\n\nMastodon is fine if you want to spend time on there. But increasingly, I\ndon\u2019t.\n\n## Nothing personal...\n\nI started my social media journey with BBSes and forums and guestbooks, the\nlatter of which I made a video about:\n\n  * via PeerTube (no ads/tracking): https://tinkerbetter.tube/w/fae4mmdJm5LN1ja5N3RjtF\n  * via YouTube (ads/tracking): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSBYO1BYrDM\n\nI entered young adulthood during the rise of MySpace and eventually Facebook.\nI enjoyed my experience on both of those platforms... until I didn\u2019t. At the\ntime I quit both, they felt like stale husks of the fun, weird places they\u2019d\nonce been for me.\n\nTwitter became my jam around 2014 or so, mostly as a lurker (and eventually\nwith a few thousand followers), but as a queer lady in a local community with\na vibrant Twitter presence, it was fun... until it wasn\u2019t.\n\nIn 2022 I discovered Mastodon and the Fediverse, largely through a fantastic\nlocal community server. Because a good chunk of familiar folks were there on\nmy local server, it felt like home. And for the most part, still does- that\nlocal Mastodon community is incredible, and I\u2019m beyond sad to be walking away\nfrom it.\n\nI\u2019ve been here for two years, and in that time, have learned quite a bit of\nhow the Fediverse works, how Mastodon works, and most importantly, how I work\nwith social media. And I\u2019m becoming increasingly convinced of one thing- me\nand \u201cmicroblogging\u201d don\u2019t actually work well together, and it\u2019s no longer fun.\n\nMaybe it never was.\n\n## Nuance: a dirty word on Mastodon\n\nI am someone who believes strongly in nuance, and this world is increasingly\ndevaluing nuance.\n\nLately whenever I toot (that\u2019s Mastodon for \u201cpost\u201d or \u201ctweet\u201d for those of you\nin a Twitter mindset about it) about something that gets more than a couple of\nboosts, I\u2019m overwhelmed with comments- mostly positive, but some of the nasty\nones are really troubling.\n\nA few months back, I posted about needing to buy something from Menards \u2013 a\nlarge regional chain of home improvement stores. I had folks berating me for\nshopping there (due to understandable disagreements about labor rights), folks\nberating those folks, and a whole lot of nastiness, some of which escalated to\nthreatening posts and emails. You might call it \u201creply-guy syndrome\u201d which is\nalive and well on the Fediverse. And what those reply-guys failed to consider\n\u2013 and what I was afraid to mention \u2013 is that where I live, sometimes the only\nchoice for certain household items is between Menards and Amazon- nuance!\n\nAs I\u2019ve been slowly changing careers from \u201csysadmin mom with occasional\nYouTube videos\u201d to \u201cfull time maker\u201d, it feels like the more I post, the more\nreply-guy syndrome rears its ugly head. I toot about search engines, and I\u2019ve\ngot reply-guys telling me my search engine preferences are bad. I toot about\nMatrix, and I\u2019ve got reply-guys berating me for not using XMPP instead. I toot\nabout Wayland, and people are starting arguments in the comments about\nHyprland. It\u2019s not fun anymore.\n\nAnd it isn\u2019t just me experiencing this: a well known YouTuber recently tooted\nabout how YouTube Premium was actually a pretty good deal if you watch a lot\nof YouTube. I agree! But seeing the comments under that post really gave me\npause. I was terrified to tell folks that I agree, or that I use YouTube\nPremium too [gasp].\n\nAdding to this problem is that Mastodon can be hard to navigate, because if\nyou\u2019ve blocked or muted a server, you may have a broken chain of replies. My\nserver (correctly) muted some of the larger unrestricted servers, and that\nmeans when reply-folk over there reply at me, I don\u2019t see those responses\nunless I\u2019m following the sender. But I do see folks replying to them- this\ngets weirder and more complex the larger a base of replies are. Positive or\nnegative, it\u2019s a tough thing to work around.\n\nAll that aside, the problem isn\u2019t just \u201cbad comments\u201d, because I\u2019m a grown\nwoman and can take critique. The biggest problem is that a portion of those\nfolks take screenshots and share them with unsavory folks. Not a week goes by\nthat I don\u2019t get some nasty email from someone I blocked on Mastodon. Some of\nthese have been threatening, and it\u2019s gotten to the point where before I toot,\nI think \u201cwill someone threaten to kill me over this?\u201d That\u2019s not fun.\n\nI\u2019m just a mom making videos about tech. But to me at least, not even Mastodon\nis free from the worst tendencies of a world where nuance is set aside for\ngamified social capital. I shouldn\u2019t have a fight-or-flight response when I\npost about shopping for tools.\n\n## Microblogging vs longer form information\n\nIn longer form online content, such as blog posts and videos, nuance gets to\nshine. I know we live in a world where short form \u201cTikTok-style\u201d content is\nbecoming more popular, but it\u2019s not what I make, and I\u2019ll probably never make\nit, because I don\u2019t really enjoy consuming it.\n\nI like longer form content, with explanation, nuance, snark, and fun.\nMicroblogging \u2013 the short form Twitter-style \u201cposts\u201d that Mastodon, Bluesky,\nand Threads replicates, is increasingly feeling like the written version of\nTikTok- it\u2019s just a chance to dunk on someone else to get a higher digital\nscore.\n\nIt didn\u2019t feel that way in the past, but maybe I\u2019m wrong. Maybe that\u2019s what it\nalways was. If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ve wasted a lot of time, and I\u2019m going to\nstop wasting it.\n\n## What comes next for me?\n\nI might delete my Mastodon. I might keep it but eventually just use it to post\nlinks to my work elsewhere. I might decide I\u2019ve judged Mastodon harshly and\nreturn in the future. There are no promises here.\n\nAs far as social media is concerned, I am going to be focusing more of my\nsocial energy on my Patrons and Ko-Fi supporters who make Veronica Explains\npossible. I will still be posting my videos on PeerTube (via\nTinkerBetter.tube), as well as my YouTube channel, and writing longer form\nposts on this blog. I might even try and make this blog ActivityPub friendly-\nwho knows?\n\nWhat I know right now is that Mastodon has increasingly felt like a place that\ntakes my energy and gives me little in return, and I\u2019m excited to set\nmicroblogging aside. Maybe you should, too.\n\nIf there\u2019s a social media site in your life that isn\u2019t benefiting you,\nconsider dropping it. Seriously- life is short and we only get so much time.\nDon\u2019t waste it making fart jokes and dunking on companies you don\u2019t like.\n\nOr whatever, you do you. \ud83d\ude42\n\n## Brief update 2024-04-04\n\nI\u2019ve decided to attempt to bridge this blog to the Fediverse via the\nActivityPub plugin. This should hopefully allow some of my followers and\nsupporters over on Mastodon, and other services, to be able to engage and\ncomment on the blog, directly from the Fediverse.\n\nI don\u2019t know for sure how well this will go, so stay tuned, I guess.\n\nCategories personal updates, tech and culture Tags fediverse, human\ninteraction, mastodon, social media\n\n## Thanks for reading!\n\nThe written version of Veronica Explains is made possible by my Patrons and\nKo-Fi members.
