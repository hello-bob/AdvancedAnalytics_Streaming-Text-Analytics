It perniciously pulls at threads, ekes away\nseconds, and scrapes at precious things. It takes it's toll \u2014 slowly with the\ndrip drip of pennies. Then suddenly, with a sharp jab under your thumbnail \u2014\nyou pay with blood.\n\nBefore Amazon Prime, before Netflix, there was staples \u2014 the sharp steel teeth\nwe use to bind documents together. We accept staples are the cost of keeping\norder, but are they worth the chaos they bring?\n\n## Reasons staples are bad\n\n  * Staples tear at precious clothing.\n  * Staples cause injuries. Staples scratch at your skin and give you sharp pokes under your fingernails.\n  * Staples damage gadgets. They scratch at phone screens, stick themselves into the seams of gadgets, get magnetically stuck to things they oughtn't \u2014 like the MagSafe charging port on the laptop I am typing these very words on.\n  * Staples cost money. One staple costs around $0.000436.\n  * Staples use up your precious time \u2014 buying staples and refilling staplers.\n  * Staples require a different tool entirely to undo the staples.\n  * Staples get swallowed by pets, babies, or even adult diners in your otherwise perfectly safe dining establishment.\n  * Staples do not spark joy \u2014 they take up space in drawers.\n  * Staples require removing before recycling.\n  * Staples jam up the gears of your trusty paper shredder.\n  * Perhaps worst of all, staples have mass you have to lug around with you whenever you are carrying documents. One staple weighs 0.02936g.\n\nThere is now a viable alternative that allows you to unbind yourself from\nstaples. The staple-less stapler.\n\nThis article effectively serves as an advert for staple-less staplers for I\nlove them, and they embody everything Practical Betterments stands for.\n\n## Reasons to bind paper and the limits of staple-less staplers\n\nStaple-less staplers are limited by the number of pieces they can bind\ntogether. Typically between 5 and 10. So long as you don't need to create\nlarge booklets of printed paper, a staple-less stapler will do the job.\n\n### Reasons to use a staple-less stapler\n\n  * Binding related papers together. For instance, a store receipt and a card receipt for the same transaction \u2014 this keeps them tidy and easy to locate.\n  * Strengthening papers. Bound travel documents will be less likely to get crumpled, giving the impression you're a well put together person. Helpful when being inspected by border agents.\n  * Reducing the chance of losing a loose sheet. For instance, the final amendment to your will that negates all of your previous statements and gives the remainder of your estate to your cat.\n\n### Reasons to use something else\n\n  * Keeping papers in the right order. Your screen play should be kept in the correct order or it may be mistaken as derivative of Christopher Nolan. I am not in the position to recommend a staple-free solution to this issue \u2014 but I'm sure they exist.\n\n## The two types of staple-less staplers\n\nThere are two types of staple-less staplers \u2014 both kinds perform the binding\nwith a single squeeze of the hand.\n\nBoth versions I own are made by the Japanese company Kokuyo \u2014 and they both\nresemble whales.\n\nJust a side note. Kokuyo has an interesting approach labelling environmentally\nfriendly products. They don't do it. Instead they label their products that\nare bad for the environment. A sort of reverse green washing.\n\n### Staple-less staplers that make a hole\n\nThese staple-less staplers punch a hole in the paper, then fold and feed the\npaper through the hole.\n\nThese staple-less staplers can bind up to 10 sheets of paper.\n\n#### Affiliate link for the original staple-less stapler\n\nThis is the original staple-less stapler made by kokuyo. I've had mine for\nmaybe a decade, I do prefer the crimping version described below.\n\nKokuyo Harinacs Stapleless Stapler \u2014 Amazon*\n\n*If you buy anything using this link I will get some money at no extra cost to you. You'll also be financing the interplanetary dreams of the world's richest person.\n\n### Staple-less staplers that crimp the paper\n\nThese staple-less staplers bind papers by crimping them together. They can\nonly bind up to 5 sheets at a time. Instead of making a hole, this one forms a\nsatisfying set of ridges. This method has the advantage of being easily\nundoable \u2014 simple pressing the ridges flat allows you to easily unbind the\npaper.\n\n#### Affiliate link for the crimping staple-less stapler\n\nThis is probably my favourite bit of stationery. It can't do as many sheets,\nbut looks way neater.\n\nKokuyo Harinacs Stapleless Stapler \u2014 Amazon*\n\n*If you buy anything using this link I will get some money at no extra cost to you.

I took them out of their box, they got\neverywhere \u2014 I hate staples \u2014 and put them on the scales. They weighed 146.8g.\n\nSo 146.8 / 5000 = 0.02936g.\n\nOne staple weighs around 0.029g.\n\n## How much does a staple cost?\n\nAfter a quick google the cheapest staples I found was a pack of 5000 staples\nthat costs $2.18.\n\nDivide $2.18 by 5000 and you get $0.000436.\n\n## How many staples would you need to use for a staple-less stapler to pay for\nitself?\n\nWell, given that each staple costs $0.000436 and the recommended and original\nstaple-less stapler costs $12 that gets you to about 27523 staples or about 5\npacks of 5000.\n\nNot bad, but also beside the point. The real cost of staples comes in the form\nof bandages, vet bills, and device repairs.\n\nThis simple cost benefit analysis also fails to take into account the value of\nthe staples you currently own.\n\n## How much money can you get by taking a pack of staples to a scrap yard\n\nHaving found a pack of staples \u2014 taken it home, and weighed it, I obviously\nwanted to get rid of them.\n\nBut it occurred to me, if I was going to recommend people replace their\nstaples with a staple-less stapler, I couldn't expect them just to throw away\nall their already purchased staples. To many that would be an unacceptable\nsunken cost.\n\nSo, I took my pack of staples to a local scrap metal yard and asked what they\nwould be worth as scrap.\n\nThey we're very polite and accommodating, if a little puzzled.\n\nUnfortunately the staples didn't weigh enough to register on their scales \u2014\nwhich are usually used to weigh entire truck loads of any-old-iron.\n\nA disappointing turnout \u2014 to get any payout on a pack of staples you need to\ninclude it as part of a larger load.\n\nScrap metal prices fluctuate a lot and differ from scrap yard to scrap yard.\nThe scrap yard I visited was taking mixed metal scrap for \u00a3155 ($194) per\n1000kg. That means a pack of 5000 staples would pay out \u00a30.02.\n\nSo \u2014 keep that in mind before you buy.\n\nTags\n\n    \n\n  * load lightening\n  * sub-gram optimization\n  * favourite\n  * saving money\n  * saving time\n  * stationery\n\nPublished\n\n    29 Apr 2024\nUpdated\n\n    29 Apr 2024\n\nFound this useful?
