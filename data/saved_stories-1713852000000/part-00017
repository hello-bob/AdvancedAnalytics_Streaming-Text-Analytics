Black 3 minute read\n\nscience; publishing; academic papers; impact\n\nMichael J. Black\n\nBuild what you need and use what you build. This is a core philosophy of my\nresearch. It shifts the focus away from writing and publishing \u201cpapers\u201d to\nwhat really matters \u2014 impact.\n\nAt the start of any research project, my students know that I will ask them\n\u201cWho\u2019s your customer?\u201d By customer, I don\u2019t mean \u201cpaying customer\u201d. I mean\n\u201cwho needs what you\u2019re proposing?\u201d Who will use it? Why do they need it? If\nyou can\u2019t answer this, then your work is likely to be irrelevant.\n\nA good answer to \u201cwho\u2019s your customer?\u201d can be \u201cme\u201d. If you need it, then you\nneed it. And if you need it, there are probably other people out there in the\nworld like you who will need it too. Corollary: if you aren\u2019t going to use it,\nwhy do you think others will?\n\nImportantly, if you're your own customer, then it doesn\u2019t matter what Reviewer\n2 thinks. It doesn\u2019t matter if it gets published. You need it and will build\nit regardless of what the world thinks. It takes you out of the publishing rat\nrace and focuses you on what you think is important.\n\nAn example is BEDLAM - our synthetic dataset for training 3D human pose and\nshape regressors. When we were working on BEDLAM, I said to the team \u201cit\ndoesn\u2019t matter if this gets published because we need it.\u201d We were going to\nbuild it no matter what. It didn\u2019t exist and we needed it. We were our own\ncustomers. (It got published at CVPR 2023, precisely because it is useful and\nwe demonstrated this.)\n\nThe second part of my maxim is to \u201cuse what you build.\u201d This is critical. If\nyou write a paper and never build on it, then why do you think others will?\nPapers that you don\u2019t build on are dead ends. Cute ideas with no impact. These\npapers don\u2019t change the field.\n\nIf the idea is good, one paper isn\u2019t enough. People don\u2019t pick up on new ideas\nright away. They don\u2019t see the future you see... yet. You need to teach the\nfuture. If you have a new idea, you will have to show people why it\u2019s also a\ngood idea. You teach the future by demonstration.\n\nAn example: we introduced the idea of using parametric 3D human shape models\nfor human pose estimation and tracking at CVPR 2007. At the time everyone was\nestimating 3D stick figures and they kept on doing so for many years. The\nimpact was modest initially. I knew it was a good idea for many reasons but\nthe world was busy with its own ideas.\n\nSo we built and built and built on top of this idea. We showed how you could\nleverage 3D humans to do more, do better, and solve new problems. It took many\npapers for us to teach what we already saw. It took making software and data\navailable to enable others to follow. You teach by example.\n\nIn my department, we build what we need and we use what we build. This focuses\nus on impact not papers. It helps us build a community of \u201ccustomers\u201d. Impact\ncomes from a community that expands on your ideas. Teach your ideas. Provide\nthe tools for others to follow. And then be happy when others surpass you.\nThat's impact.\n\nscience; publishing; academic papers; impact\n\nThe Perceiving Systems Department is a leading Computer Vision group in\nGermany.\n\nWe are part of the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in T\u00fcbingen \u2014\nthe heart of Cyber Valley.\n\nWe use Machine Learning to train computers to recover human behavior in fine\ndetail, including face and hand movement. We also recover the 3D structure of\nthe world, its motion, and the objects in it to understand how humans interact\nwith 3D scenes.\n\nBy capturing human motion, and modeling behavior, we contibute realistic\navatars to Computer Graphics.\n\nTo have an impact beyond academia we develop applications in medicine and\npsychology, spin off companies, and license technology. We make most of our\ncode and data available to the research community.\n\n  * Find us on Facebook\n\n  * Follow us on Twitter\n\n  * Visit our YouTube Channel\n\n  * Perceiving Systems Department\n\n  * MPI for Intelligent Systems\n\n  * Cyber Valley\n\n\u00a9 2024 Max-Planck-Gesellschaft - Imprint | Privacy Policy\n\nSign In\n\n\u00a9 2024 Max-Planck-Gesellschaft\n\n", "frontpage": false}
