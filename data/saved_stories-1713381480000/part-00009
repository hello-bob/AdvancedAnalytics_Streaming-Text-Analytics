After reading the docs, watching a few talks\nfrom Jussi Pakkanen, and experimenting on a few existing projects, I found\nmyself pleasently suprised by Meson.\n\nA lot of what has made Meson work well has been the highly principled approach\nJussi has taken:\n\n  * Learn from previous systems: CMake, Scons, etc\n  * Minimize complexity by adding only the minimal feature set required\n  * Design a DSL for build specification, but discourage any feature creep towards becoming a general-purpose langauge\n\nHowever, in many of the talks, there are claims that \"Meson is not Turing-\nComplete and will never be Turing-Complete\".\n\nAfter reading through documentation and seeing if-stmts, foreach-loops,\narrays, strings, etc the claim seemed very implausible. Further, user-defined\nfunctions were rejected in the past because apparently they'd suddenly make\nMeson turing-complete. Huh?\n\nSo, this is a proof that shows Meson actually already is turing-complete.\n\n## Turing Complete\n\nMathematically speaking, no modern lanaguage is turning-complete because\nmemory size on any machine has a fixed upper-bound. So, when programmers say\n\"turing-complete\" they usually mean \"it would be turing-complete if it also\nhad infinite memory\". This is a dubious definition, but most programmers seem\nto agree that any language that can implement a brainfuck interpretor is\nturing-complete.\n\n## Brainfuck\n\nAn esoteric language that seems to be nearly every programmer's favorite\nesolang toy, with countless implementations\n(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck)\n\n## Discussion\n\nI don't think this proof invalidates any of the excellent work that has been\nput into Meson. If anything, this shows that build configuration is a hard\nenough problem that requires a turing-complete language. Most features have\ngone into Meson because somebody actually needed them. And for this reason,\nMeson serves as an estimate of the required complexity.\n\nThe distinction of turing-completeness is actually not very interesting (e.g.\nsee https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_tarpit)\n\nI would argue that Meson's goal is not to avoid turing-complete-ness. It's\ngoal is to be an excellent build-description langaugae and go no further. It's\ngoal is to be a terrible general-purpose langauge.\n\n## About\n\nA proof that Meson is actually Turing-Complete\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n10 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n2 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n0 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n  * Meson 100.0%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
