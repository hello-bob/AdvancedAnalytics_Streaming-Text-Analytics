Among the gems I wanted to revisit was Netscape\nCommunicator, a software suite from 1997 centered around Netscape Navigator,\nwhich was the first web browser I ever used. One of the other applications\nincluded in that suite was a WYSIWYG web page editor named Netscape Composer.\n\nNetscape Composer was my first introduction to web development. As a kid, I\ncreated my first web pages using it. Those pages never made it online, but I\nproudly carried them around on a floppy disk to show them off on family\nmembers' and friends' computers. This is likely how I got the understanding\nthat websites are just made of files. Using Netscape Composer also taught me\nbasic web vocabulary, such as \"page\" and \"hyperlink\".\n\nOf course, the web landscape has evolved immensely since then. I was curious\nto try out that dated software again and see what its limitations were, and\nwhat the code it produces looks like from a 2024 perspective. The first thing\nI needed was a goal. I decided to try and reproduce the home page of my\npersonal website as closely as the application allowed it. That seemed like a\nsensible aim as my website has a rather minimalistic design, with very little\nthat should be completely out of reach for an antiquated tool.\n\nThe version of Netscape Composer I used is the one included in Netscape\nCommunicator 4.8, released in 2002. I set the following rules for my\nexperiment:\n\n  * The aim was to create a web page looking as much as possible like my actual website's home page;\n  * By using Netscape Composer only;\n  * Without writing a single line of HTML or CSS;\n  * I was allowed to use images for the social media icons in the page footer.\n\n## The Aim\n\nThis is what my actual home page looks like:\n\n## The Visual Result\n\nThis is the end result, as seen in Netscape Composer itself:\n\nAnd now, the same result, as seen in Netscape Navigator with a 1024x768\nresolution:\n\nFinally, what it looks like on a modern browser:\n\nHere are some ways in which the look of the result differs from the aim:\n\n  * The result pretty much occupies the whole viewport, with no margin. I did not find a way to add margins or padding to the page's body in Netscape Composer.\n  * My picture is not circle-shaped.\n  * I had to settle for :-) in lieu of the smiling emoji. As Netscape Composer has an \"Insert Special Character\" feature, I was hoping it would at least offer me a \u263a, but it did not. I could of course have copied that symbol from somewhere, but I felt like that would have moved me away from my goal of using only Netscape Composer.\n  * The links in the result are underlined. I was not able to change their styling other than the color.\n  * The margins between elements are wrong. I was not able to customize them except for the images.\n  * The result uses default fonts available in web browsers. I did not find a way to add custom fonts.\n\n## The Resulting HTML\n\nThis is the HTML that was produced by Netscape Composer:\n\n    \n    \n    <!doctype html public \"-//w3c//dtd html 4.0 transitional//en\"> <html> <head> <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\"> <meta name=\"Author\" content=\"Pier-Luc Brault\"> <meta name=\"GENERATOR\" content=\"Mozilla/4.8 [en] (Win98; U) [Netscape]\"> <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Partying like it's 1998!\"> <title>Pier-Luc Brault - Personal Website</title> </head> <body text=\"#FFFFFF\" bgcolor=\"#000000\" link=\"#ADD8E6\" vlink=\"#ADD8E6\" alink=\"#ADD8E6\"> <center> <h1> <img SRC=\"photo.jpg\" HSPACE=30 height=128 width=100 align=CENTER>Hi, I'm Pier-Luc Brault. :-)</h1></center> I am a computer science teacher at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cegep_de_Sherbrooke\">C&eacute;gep de Sherbrooke</a>, and a former software developer.

Sure, it lacks a bit of\nindentation, and it contains a few things that would make any modern web\ndeveloper cringe, such as font and center tags, and styling attributes\n(Netscape Composer did not know CSS). But it is not worse than some of the\nold-fashioned HTML I have seen from university professors. Hey, at least the\ntags are not written in all caps!\n\nOn a more technical point of view now: did I get valid HTML? Let's throw that\ncode at the W3C Validator!\n\nOops, it turns out the code contains quite a few errors according to the W3C,\nmostly about using invalid attributes and values, as well as missing\nalternative texts for images (the latter could have been fixed directly in\nNetscape Composer). Nevertheless, it would have rendered as intended in 2002,\nand it is rendering as intended today. What I saw in Netscape Composer was\nwhat I got!\n\n## The Journey\n\nSo, how was it to use a WYSIWYG web page editor from over 20 years ago? Quite\npleasant, actually. That application has more than decent UX, and has not made\nme swear nearly as much as Microsoft Word does in a typical usage session.\nHere is an overview of the steps I followed to create my page:\n\nI started with setting some general properties for the page, such as its\ntitle, background color, and text colors for paragraphs and links.\n\nThen I proceeded to type the text content of my page, discovering the \"Insert\nSpecial Character\" feature along the way (that I hoped would contain \u263a).\nDropdown menus on the top toolbar made it easy to style all the text as\nneeded. It was also quite easy to add the horizontal line and the table, and\nto customize them as needed.\n\nThe following step was to add the image at the top of the page and make sure\nit floated as intended on the left of the title. That went surprisingly well!\nIt is one of the ways in which Netscape Composer failed to make me swear as\nmuch as Microsoft Word.\n\nAt some point along the way, I realized that Netscape Composer did not like\nthe relative addresses I had used for my links (maybe because the targetted\nfiles did not actually exist on my file system?), and had weirdly added ../../\nat the beginning of all of them. I therefore changed them to absolute URLs.\n\nFun fact: to transfer the images I needed for my web page to my Windows 98\nmachine, I used an unsecured FTP server on Debian, hosted on my local network,\nthat I accessed using an old version of FileZilla. It just worked! I used the\nsame method to transfer all the screenshots I took for this blog post back to\nmy contemporary computer.\n\n## The Bottomline\n\nI think the main thing I will remember about this experiment is: I had fun! It\nwas a pleasant stroll down memory lane and a nice reminder of what HTML used\nto look like. It also made the demonstration that the Web was built as such a\nrobust platform that outdated HTML generated by an app from more than two\ndecades ago can still render as originally intended on a modern web browser. I\nwill also remember that good UX can be found in old-timey applications too!\n\n\u00a9 2024 Pier-Luc Brault\n\nThe opinions expressed on this website are solely those of the author.\n\nDisclaimer | Privacy Policy\n\n", "frontpage": true}
