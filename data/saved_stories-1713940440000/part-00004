Here are some things I like about\nit:\n\n  * it is conceptually very simple\n  * it is weirdly difficult\n  * it is played in real time, so it is always everyone\u2019s turn\n  * it plays well online, e.g. via Set with Friends\n\nThe rules of Set are simple, but hard to explain in words. In fact, most of\nthe game is about one rule, which I\u2019ll refer to as the rule. Set is about\nfinding sets of 3 cards which satisfy the rule. Instead of telling you what\nthe rule is, I will let you experiment and discover it.\n\nLet\u2019s with a simplified version of the game.\n\nFrom the following 4 cards, only 1 valid set can be formed. Select the 3 cards\nthat obey the rule. This page is slightly interactive and you can click on\ncards to select them.\n\nIn the following 4 cards, 1 valid set can be made. What is it?\n\nThat summarizes the two types of sets that can be formed.\n\nThe rule has a nice property: if I pick out any two cards, then there exists\nonly one card that can round out a valid set of 3.\n\nLet\u2019s practice:\n\nIf we start with these 2 cards, what third card would make a set?\n\nAs a reminder, here are all types of cards we\u2019ve seen so far:\n\nIf we start with these 2 cards, what third card would make a set?\n\nThe possible choices:\n\nNow let\u2019s make the game more complex. Previously, cards had only one property:\nsuit (shape). From now on, cards will have two properties: suit and\ncardinality (number).\n\nGiven the two starting cards, find the third card that satisfies the rule:\n\nAs a reference, here is every combination of suit and cardinality.\n\nThe third card of the set is in here somewhere:\n\nAs above, find the third card that satisfies the rule:\n\nChoices:\n\nYou are almost ready to play. Cards in Set actually have 4 properties: suit,\ncardinality, colour and texture.\n\nThere are 4 suits, but the same principles apply as before.\n\nLet\u2019s work out one last example.\n\nGiven the following two cards, what third would form a set?\n\nWith 4 different properties, there are slightly too many cards to show you\nevery possibility. I\u2019ll draw a few from the deck, and hopefully the matching\ncard is in there somewhere.\n\nThat is the core of how to play Set! The challenge of the game is figuring out\nhow to do that quickly, while competing with others.\n\nThe rest of the rules are straightforward. There is a deck with one copy of\neach possible card (that makes 3^4 = 81 cards). 12 cards are turned face up.\nPlayers compete in real time to point out sets. If you pick a valid set, you\nkeep the cards as points, remove them from the table, and turn over new cards\nfrom the deck to replenish the cards on the table back up to a total of 12. In\nthe rare case that no sets can be made, an additional 3 cards can be turned\nface up (bringing the total up to 15). The game ends when the deck is empty\nand no more sets can be made.\n\nFor online multiplayer I recommend the free and excellent Set with Friends.\nTheir code is also on Github and I adapted it to render the cards.\n\nGo forth and enjoy!\n\n\u00ab Things You're Allowed to Do: At the Dentist\n\n## the weightless state\n\n  * the weightless state\n\n  * metavee\n\nRobin Neufeld's projects and thoughts.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
