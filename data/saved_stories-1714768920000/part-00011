The\ncompany was established in 2013, has been bootstrapped from the start, and\ncurrently generates $3M annually.\n\n## Before Interact\n\nBefore launching Interact, Josh and his co-founder were designing and\ndeveloping custom websites for clients.\n\nAround 2009/2010, platforms like SquareSpace or Wix hadn\u2019t yet gained their\ncurrent popularity or feature-rich development.\n\nThrough conversations with various clients, Josh realized that once websites\nwere online, the primary concern for most was how effectively they could\ncapture leads.\n\nEssentially, unless you make money from ads, having tons of traffic is just a\nvanity metric and is useless if it isn\u2019t captured in the right way.\n\n## The idea for Interact\n\nThe initial idea for Interact was born when a client requested that Josh\ncreate a custom online quiz for his own website.\n\nThe client, a sales coach, aimed to offer his website visitors a tool to\nassess their \u201csales personality,\u201d which would serve dual purposes: generating\nleads for the website owner and providing valuable feedback to the visitors.\n\nThis approach was very different from traditional outbound marketing and\nproved successful immediately. Before implementing the \u201cquiz experiment,\u201d the\nclient\u2019s website conversion rate hovered around 3-4%; after the quiz went\nlive, the conversion rate skyrocketed to 40%!\n\nThis win shows just why online quizzes works so well than the usual marketing\nstuff and other ways to get leads.\n\nThink about how many times you\u2019ve grabbed a free eBook and left it unread on\nyour desktop, or signed up for an email drip campagin and then totally ignored\nyour inbox a few days later.\n\nA key reason online quizzes are so effective is that they actively engage\nparticipants by involving them in answering questions and then presenting them\nwith personalized results.\n\nKeep in mind: this was happening in 2013, a time when online quiz makers were\nscarce. We will come back to this later.\n\nOnce the custom quiz was complete, Josh recognized the potential for a\nproduct.\n\nHe decided to explore this idea further by offering quiz-building as a service\non Freelance.com (now Upwork), charging about $200 for a custom quiz.\nUnfortunately, this turned out to be a miscalculation as the development of a\ncustom quiz was highly time-consuming.\n\nPersonal Note: despite the setback, I believe this approach is an effective\nway to pretotype ideas.\n\nInstead of investing months in designing and coding an entire product from\nscratch, testing market demand through a service offering can provide\nimmediate insights into whether people are willing to pay, while still\ndelivering the same result\u2014a quiz embedded on their website.\n\nAfter continuing to develop Interact alongside their agency work for five\nyears, they amassed only a few hundred users. The path to significant product\ngrowth was lengthy.\n\n## Getting traction\n\nBy 2013, the company catered to a diverse clientele, spanning various\nindustries and sizes. As Josh remarked, \u201cUnless you have a lot of resources,\nyou can\u2019t serve everyone.\n\nThis realization led them to refine their focus on a specific ideal customer\nprofile; \u201cWe probably did around 3000-4000 calls to really understand our\ncustomers and make the perfect product for them\u201d.\n\nThey discovered that their most successful customers shared two common\ncharacteristics:\n\n  1. They knew how to attract traffic.\n  2. They had a clear understanding of their target audience.\n\nIn other words: Interact\u2019s best customers knew with their audience and simply\nneeded an effective method to convert them.\n\nJosh tried a bunch of ways to get more customers, from handing out flyers to\nsending cold emails, but none of it really paid off.\n\nThen, Josh wrote a blog post called \u201cHow to Create an Online Quiz.\u201d Since\nthere weren\u2019t many other quiz makers online at the time, his post quickly\nclimbed to the top of search engine rankings.\n\nJosh\u2019s article quickly ascended to the number one spot on Google. \u201cWithin two\ndays, we were the top result; the traffic was minimal, averaging about 10\nvisitors a day, but it was highly targeted. Of those 10 visitors, 2 became\ncustomers.\u201d\n\nThere are a few lessons here.\n\nFirst: do not dismiss SEO because you think there\u2019s not enough traffic for\nyour keywords. Second: I think this is a perfect example of focusing on\nsomething that\u2019s small now but will grow in the future. Don\u2019t be discouraged\nif you don\u2019t see a market today for your product. After all, there was no\nAirbnb before Airbnb.\n\nOnce they\u2019ve nailed their ICP and understood how to get customers, they double\ndown on producing useful content and pre-built quizzes (personally...I feel\nlike I have to check the \u201cParent Burnout\u201d quiz!)\n\nTo this day, Josh\u2019s content strategy remains effective; Interact has\nreplicated a similar approach on YouTube, where one of their most successful\nvideos is a tutorial on how to transform a PDF into a quiz using ChatGPT.\n\n## Leveraging AI\n\nOne factor that has significantly contributed to Interact\u2019s growth in recent\nyears is their ability to assist customers in creating quizzes using AI.\n\nWhile most people are familiar with the concept of a quiz, they often struggle\nwith specifics, such as the right questions to ask, choosing an appropriate\ntopic, or even deciding on a suitable title for the quiz.\n\nLeveraging their extensive experience and insights gained from numerous\ncustomer interactions over the years, Interact has been providing guidance and\nsupport in these areas.\n\n## Revenue\n\nHere\u2019s the evolution of Interact\u2019s revenue (MRR):\n\n2014: $10.7k 2015: $22k 2016: $28k 2017: $42k 2018: $63k 2019: $103K 2020:\n$181k 2021: $214k 2022: $227k 2023: $254K\n\nToday, Interact boasts over 6,000 customers and facilitates the completion of\nover 9 million quizzes each month, generating an equivalent number of leads\nfor its customers.\n\nIf you enjoyed this story, scroll down and sign up for our newsletter to\nreceive the next story directly in your inbox, free of charge.\n\nPrevious\n\nShare the Post:\n\n## Join Our Newsletter\n\nPowered by EmailOctopus\n\n\u00a9 2024 All Rights Reserved.\n\nPrivacy Policy Cookie Policy\n\n", "frontpage": false}
