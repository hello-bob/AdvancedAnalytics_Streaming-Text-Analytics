Actually, forget \"the right thing\" - it's whenever I try to do pretty much anything.\n  * Yesterday's \"strategic\" thing I toiled over just got tossed into the dumpster. And they expect me to be all excited about the new \"strategy\" they coughed up?\n  * My \"colleagues\" attack me overtly and covertly all the time, all the while maintaining a \"professional\" and even cheerful demeanor - in effect, a gaslighting tactic. And in this sewage lagoon, I'm supposed to get work done?\n  * The deadline is impossible, and everybody knows it. Why are we all pretending that we're trying to meet it, when we're actually busy rehearsing our speeches blaming the inevitable failure on each other?\n\nI'm sure you can add a few similar observations of your own, which at various\ntimes & places were fairly accurate. My point in this writeup is that a\nmanager doesn't get to whine about any of this, any more than a boxer gets to\nwhine about a broken nose. A normal person very much does get to whine about a\nbroken nose, and it isn't whining - it's grounds for a lawsuit in any\nreasonable jurisdiction. But when a boxer steps into the boxing ring, he\nobviously forfeits the basic human right of not getting punched in the face.\n\nSimilarly, a normal person - the so-called \"individual contributor\", which I\nguess is what we call workers in the age where mice and keyboards replaced\nhammers and sickles - a normal person can reasonably expect some basics from\nthe workplace:\n\n  * The place should help me get work done, and provide various physical, informational and social infrastructure for this purpose.\n  * The place should articulate a strategy which my work meaningfully fits into, and manage changes to this strategy carefully and thoughtfully.\n  * I am entitled to healthy human relationships in the workplace, and to management fostering an environment conducive of healthy relationships forming, rather than abusive and adversarial ones.\n  * The schedule should not demand the impossible, and certainly when I work hard to meet whatever deadline was set, I should not worry about being blamed for the team missing the deadline in the end.\n\nThe condition meeting the full set of these lofty requirements is sometimes\ncalled \"psychological safety.\" So in short, the individual contributor is\nentitled to psychological safety - in hammer & sickle terms, workers should be\nable to focus on work.\n\nAnd by \"should,\" I don't mean it always actually happens. I just mean that\nwhen it doesn't, you can reasonably expect to resolve the situation by\nquitting the team you're on, without having to find a different line of work.\nThat, as opposed to a manager, who can only resolve this situation by finding\na different line of work.\n\nWhy isn't the manager entitled to the same human rights as everyone else?\nWell, first of all, he just isn't, meaning, if you see a manager who complains\nabout said human rights of his being violated a lot, you can be certain that\nhe's not going to stay in management for long; he'll either have the common\nsense to quit or he'll be \"demoted\" from this position (whether it's actually\na demotion, and which way in a hierarchy is up is a question in itself; some\ntheoreticians postulate that there's no up, only out - but in any case, the\nmanager will stop being one.)\n\nNow, if I do try to explain this fact, which managers usually get at the gut\nlevel without needing an explanation, the analogies that come to mind are the\nminister of foreign affairs and the plumber. You cannot, as a minister of\nforeign affairs, be sad and shocked over countries plotting against you, and\nmaybe even preparing to attack you - nobody wants a perpetually shocked\nminister of foreign affairs. And similarly, you cannot be a plumber if you're\nappalled by the sight, smell and tactile properties of shit.\n\n\"Individual contributors\" can be fairly non-competitive, certainly in an\nindustry like computing where demand for workers outstrips supply, there's\nenough work for everyone, and where you know a ton of trivia about your area\nthat anyone else would need lots of time to learn if they had to step into\nyour shoes. It's not only desirable but very possible to find a place where no\ncolleague is going to fight you in order to add your area of responsibility to\ntheirs, and thus get promoted.\n\nManagers, on the other hand, are always basically low-grade^1 fighting each\nother, in the same way as countries always have conflicting interests, even if\nthey maintain what looks like cordial relationships. I mean it not as a\nstatement about the character of managers, but as a description of their\ncondition. This condition follows, not from their character, but from various\nunfortunate facts of life - for example, the fact that managers are assumed to\nbe fungible and are hopelessly underinformed, and it gets worse with rank.\n\nThe fungibility assumption means that a manager is always under a threat of\nlosing \"territory\" to another manager, a reorg making him a report of someone\nundesirable, or a straightforward replacement, much more than an IC, which\ncreates a very competitive environment. And the theoretical impossibility of\nmanagers being truly informed on the subjects falling under their\nresponsibility guarantees that their never-ending competition involves a lot\nof so-called \"misinformation, disinformation and malinformation.\" Of course,\nthe manager's condition of eternal competition fought on such wonderful terms\ndoes filter for character - and not in a way making a manager's day spent with\ncolleagues particularly pleasant.\n\nIn fact, all the unfortunate circumstances above - like the difficulty getting\nthings done across the proverbial (organizational) boundaries, deranged\nconvulsions around \"strategy,\" schedule chicken, and of course the scheming &\nthe gaslighting - all this shit flows first and foremost from the competition\nbetween managers as well as the organization competing in the external world.\n\nICs are entitled to managers shielding them from this shit - rarely fully, but\nquite often very considerably. Managers are not entitled to this, because even\nif a 2nd, 3rd or Nth level manager would like to shield lower-ranking managers\nfrom this (a rare, if laudable, desire), it's not possible, because there's\njust too much of it going on at the same time. Of course it gets worse at\nhigher ranks, but even a 1st level manager expecting a positive atmosphere,\nthe kind that ICs take for granted - \"wow, cool stuff you've made there!\" -\nwill be sorely disappointed to learn that \"please,\" \"thank you,\" and \"sorry\"\nare gone from his day, replaced by \"our requirement,\" \"your commitment\" and\n\"customer escalation.\"\n\n\"If you want to make people happy, don't be a leader, sell ice cream,\" said a\nfirst-rate CEO and first-rate asshole Steve Jobs. To this we might add, \"If\nyou want people to make you happy, consider selling ice cream, too.\" Or it\ncould be any sort of work which isn't management. A manager needs to be\nseriously driven by something other than having a nice day, because that's\njust not gonna happen - the perfect drive for you and your higher management\nis \"getting promoted,\" and the perfect drive for you to have from the\nshareholders' POV is \"getting shit done.\" But motivation is a story for\nanother time.\n\n## Infrequently Raised Objections\n\n### I am a manager, and my days are nice.\n\nCongratulations! You're either a great liar, including to yourself (all great\nliars start with themselves), or you're completely indifferent to constant\nstruggle and maybe you even enjoy it, or you're leading a very capable\norganization which overdelivers often and underdelivers never (how big is it?\nA double digit number, tops?..), so you're enjoying what's known as \"peace\nthrough strength.\"\n\nRest assured that this condition is not fundamentally permanent (all strength\nis finite and always only goes so far), but do enjoy it while it lasts, which\ncan be for quite a while. Watch out for large reorgs, changes in the market /\ntechnology and wider strategy (as I'm sure you do; only a competent manager\ngets to enjoy any duration of peace through strength.)\n\nOr you're lucky.\n\n### I am a manager, and my manager shields me from this.\n\nYou're either effectively an IC, like \"the leader of a team of 2 people under\nsomeone who makes every 3 people into a team,\" or you're working on something\nself-contained nobody needs and it will be soon canceled, or you have some\ninfernal bond sealed in goat's blood with your manager (or your manager has it\nwith his), and when this thing explodes under external pressure, it will be\nreally ugly.\n\nOr you're lucky.\n\n### There exist organizations free from the dysfunction you describe.\n\nLike I said, \"...or you're lucky.\" Sure, they exist. They're just rare, and\nusually don't remain that way as they grow (ever heard \"we're only hiring the\nbest people?\" Well, when you're hiring a lot of people, you're hiring typical\npeople, because there aren't this many \"best\" people readily available.\nTherefore, growth tends to bring about a regression to the mean in all areas,\nincluding this one.) And most places are dysfunctional this way from day one,\nwhich by itself doesn't prevent them from succeeding and growing; nor does a\nlack of this dysfunction guarantee success.\n\nSpeaking of which, I never quite understood the meaning of \"dysfunctional\" in\n\"dysfunctional organizations.\" These organizations definitely function; they\ngenerate trillions worth of world GDP. That they aren't fun to work at in a\nmanagerial role might be true, but it is not their function to make it fun to\nwork there in a managerial role. It is the function of you to choose roles you\ncan enjoy, and I hope the above can help some people with this.\n\n### But we foster a non-hierarchical culture of openness and curiosity.\n\nIf you're looking to decorate your office space, I have a suitcase full of\nhammers and sickles I brought from Soviet Russia. I kept them to remind me of\nthe old country, but your company sounds so awesome that I'll gladly send them\nto you.\n\nMost deliberate attempts to improve upon the baseline outcome of people being\npeople make things worse. You'll do everyone a favor by going straight to the\nstandard thing without going through a tedious cult phase first.\n\n### Calmly accepting dysfunction does not a good manager make.\n\nI didn't mean to imply that accepting and having a strategy for handling\n\"dysfunction,\" or should I say the inevitable consequences of the job\ndescription, is sufficient for being a good manager, whatever that means. I'm\nonly saying that it's necessary for being a manager at all, for any reasonable\nperiod of time and with a reasonable level of job satisfaction.\n\n### This \"acceptance\" is not a binary thing. It depends on how bad it gets.\n\nIt's binary in some and not binary in others. There are 3 types of people:\npeople who binarily can't accept it; people who binarily can, regardless of\nthe depths of depravity reached; and people on whom it starts taking a toll at\na certain level. Your type can be predicted pretty well based on what\nmotivates you, and we'll discuss it in an upcoming, very motivational piece on\nmotivation.\n\nThanks to Dan Luu and Tim Pote for reviewing a draft of this post.\n\nP.S. There exists a breed of \"individual contributor\" with a fancy title, such\nas a Principal Engineer, a Fellow and other such. The desirability of the\nexistence of these titles is a subject in its own right; in our context, their\nrelevance is that they largely strip you of human rights as much as management\ntitles do. One hint of why this is so is their visibility as a status marker\nand the consequences of this visibility - their scarcity and the resulting\ncompetition, in many places fiercer than the fight for management titles. An\nexception to the rule is if you're The Guy Who Did X for some serious-ass\nvalue of X, and you got your fancy title thanks to that value of X, regardless\nof the \"technical track\" promotion politics.\n\n  1.
