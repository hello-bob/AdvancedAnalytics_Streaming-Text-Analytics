Each episode takes a deep dive into the motivation behind\nbuilding the system, its origin story, lessons learned throughout the process,\nand provides an opportunity to get to know the brilliant minds working behind\nthe scenes!\n\nJoining me for this second episode is Andrew Moore. Andrew is a Staff Software\nEngineer leading the Platform Authentication team at Uber and sits on the\nSPIFFE Steering Committee. Prior to Uber, Andrew was a Software Engineer for\nvarious US and foreign Defense and Civil contracts with Lockheed Martin,\nLeidos, and Earth Resources Technology. Outside of work, Andrew homebrews\nbeer, mead, kombucha, and Dungeons and Dragons campaigns.\n\nIn this episode, we\u2019ll be talking about Uber\u2019s use of SPIFFE/SPIRE and Charter\nfor Workload Identity and Authorization. Learn about the design choices,\nmotivations, and lessons learned that led to this setup. Plus, we\u2019ll chat\nabout Kubernetes, how to keep an abstract design mindset over a particular\ntech choice, and fads and fashion in software fads, and sprinkle in some hot\ntakes and anime references for fun! ;)\n\nListen or watch below.
