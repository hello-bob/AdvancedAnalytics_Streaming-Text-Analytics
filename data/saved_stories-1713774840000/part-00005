The name of one of the participants -\nRavi - has been changed to protect his identity.\n\nRavi travelled to Thailand dreaming of a better life for him and his new wife.\n\nInstead, the 24-year-old Sri Lankan found himself trapped in the Myanmar\njungle, being tortured for refusing to help trick lonely, rich men out of\nthousands in so-called romance scams.\n\n\"They stripped off my clothes, made me sit on a chair and gave my leg electric\nshocks. I thought it was the end of my life.\n\n\"I spent 16 days in a cell for not obeying them,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey only\ngave me water mixed with cigarette butts and ash to drink.\u201d\n\nBut that was not the worst of it, he says. Five or six days in, two girls were\nbrought in and gang raped in front of him.\n\n\u201cWhen I witnessed it, I feared, 'What will these people do to me?' It was then\nthat I doubted they would let me live,\u201d Ravi said.\n\nRavi said he was left so badly injured it felt as if one side of his body was\nparalysed\n\nIn August 2023, the UN estimated that more than 120,000 people, most of them\nmen from Asia, had been forced to work in scam centres in Myanmar like the one\nRavi found himself in.\n\nThe centres are fed by a steady stream of aspiring migrant workers from all\nover the world. The Sri Lankan authorities say they know of at least 56 of its\ncitizens alone who are trapped in four different locations in Myanmar,\nalthough the Sri Lankan ambassador to Myanmar, Janaka Bandara, told the BBC\nthat eight of them had recently been rescued with the help of the Myanmar\nauthorities.\n\nRavi was one of those aspiring migrants, tempted by the promise of a job in\ndata entry with a basic salary of 370,000 rupees ($1,200).\n\nThe computer specialist jumped at the chance - it was money he couldn\u2019t dream\nof in Sri Lanka, which has been hit by an economic crisis.\n\nAnd so, he took out a loan of 250,000 rupees ($815) to pay the recruiter.\n\nRavi arrived in Bangkok in early 2023, but was immediately sent to Mae Sot, a\ncity in western Thailand.\n\n\"We were taken to a hotel, but soon handed over to two gunmen. They took us to\nMyanmar crossing a river,\" Ravi explained.\n\nThe group ended up in Myawaddy - a town at the centre of recent fighting\nbetween the military regime which seized power three years ago, and allied\nanti-coup forces.\n\nFrom there, they found themselves in a camp run by Chinese-speaking\ngangmasters, surrounded by tall walls and barbed wires, with armed guards\nprotecting the entrance around the clock.\n\n\"We were terrified. About 40 young men and women, including Sri Lankans,\nindividuals from Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, and African countries, were\nforcibly detained in the camp,\" he said.\n\nWhile scam centres have popped up across South East Asia, they have been\nparticularly prevalent in Myanmar, where they have generated billions of\ndollars for both Chinese underworld crime syndicates, and the various armed\ngroups operating in border towns.\n\nIn this particular scam centre, the focus was so-called romance scams. The\ncost of such scams to victims is hard to establish, but the FBI found in its\n2023 Internet Crime Report that there had been more than 17,000 complaints of\nconfidence or romance scams in the US, with losses totalling $652m.\n\nAccording to Ravi, he and the others were forced to work up to 22 hours a day\n- getting only one day off each month - and told to target wealthy men,\nparticularly in Western countries, by building romantic relationships using\nstolen phone numbers, social media and messaging platforms.\n\nThey contacted the victims directly, typically making them believe the first\nmessage - often just a simple \"hi\" - was sent by mistake.\n\nSome people ignored the messages, Ravi says, but lonely people or those\nlooking for sex often took the bait.\n\nWhen they did, a group of young women at the camp were forced to take explicit\npictures to further entice the target.\n\nAfter exchanging hundreds of messages in just a few days, the scammers would\ngain the trust of these men and persuade them to invest large sums of money in\nfake online trading platforms.\n\nFake apps then display false investment and profit information.\n\n\"If a person transfers $100,000, we return $50,000 to them, saying it is their\nprofit. This gives the impression that they now have $150,000, but in reality,\nthey only get back half of their initial $100,000, leaving the other half to\nus,\" Ravi explained.\n\nWhen the scammers have taken as much as they can from the victims, the\nmessaging accounts and social media profiles disappear.\n\nDisobey, and you faced - as Ravi had - beatings and torture.\n\nBut there are ways out: you can pay.\n\nOne man who did exactly that was Neel Vijay, a 21-year-old from Maharashtra in\nwestern India, who was trafficked to Myanmar along with five other Indian men\nand two Filipino women in August 2022.\n\nHe told the BBC that a childhood friend of his mother had promised him a call\ncentre job in Bangkok, and had charged them an agent's fee of 150,000 Indian\nrupees ($1,800).\n\n\"There were several companies run by Chinese-speaking people. All of them were\nscammers. We were sold to those companies,\" Neel said.\n\n\"When we reached that place, I lost hope. If my mother hadn't given them the\nransom money, I would have been tortured like others.\"\n\nNOPPORN WICHACHAT\n\nNeel made it back to India in less than two weeks with the help of Thai\nauthorities\n\nNeel's family paid the gang 600,000 Indian rupees ($7,190) to release him\nafter he refused to be involved in the scam, but not before he had witnessed\nthe brutal punishment meted out to people who either didn't meet the targets\nor couldn't afford to pay the ransom.\n\nAfter his release, the Thai authorities helped him get back to India, where\nhis family has taken legal action against the local recruiters.\n\nRavi was also passed between gangs during the six months he was trapped in\nMyanmar.\n\nHe ended up in the cell after a confrontation with the team leader led to a\nfight.\n\n\u201cI told them that I couldn't scam these people. Even though I had no money, I\ndidn't feel like stealing someone else's hard-earned money. The thought alone\ncaused me great mental anguish,\u201d Ravi said.\n\nFinally, the \"Chinese boss\" came to see Ravi and offered him \"one last chance\"\nto work again - a new opportunity due to his expertise in computer software.\n\n\"I had no choice; half my body was paralysed by then,\" he added.\n\nNOPPORN WICHACHAT\n\nNeel, an Indian victim, was rescued by Thai authorities and crossed the river\nto safety\n\nFor a further four months, Ravi managed Facebook accounts set up using a VPN,\nartificial intelligence apps, and 3D video cameras.\n\nMeanwhile, Ravi begged to be allowed to go to Sri Lanka to visit his ill\nmother.\n\nThe gang leader agreed to let him go if Ravi paid a ransom of 600,000 rupees\n($2,000) and an additional 200,000 rupees ($650) for crossing the river and\nentering Thailand.\n\nHis parents borrowed money - putting their house up as collateral - and\ntransferred it to him, and Ravi was taken back to Mae Sot.\n\nWhen he was fined 20,000 Thai baht ($550) at the airport for not having a\nvisa, Ravi's parents had to take out a further loan.\n\n\"When I arrived in Sri Lanka, I had a debt of 1,850,000 rupees ($6,100),\" he\nsaid.\n\nHe may be back home now, yet Ravi barely sees his new bride.\n\n\"I work day and night in a garage to pay off this debt. We have pawned both of\nour wedding rings to pay the interest,\" he said bitterly.\n\nMyanmar\n\nSri Lanka\n\nRelated\n\n## Inside Thailand's Casablanca: A town of exiles, revolutionaries and fear\n\n5 days ago\n\nAsia\n\n## Myanmar's army massacred Rohingyas.
