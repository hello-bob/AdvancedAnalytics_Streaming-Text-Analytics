I am sharing below a beautiful tribute that\nDoug Hofstadter just wrote with friends and relatives, with Doug\u2019s kind\npermisson. (As he notes,\u201d please explain ... that I wrote it with just friends\nand family as the intended audience, and that I hadn\u2019t thought of it as a\npublic document, but that when you suggested distributing it, I appreciated\nthe idea.\u201d)\n\nDear friends and relatives,\n\nI just received the very sad news about the passing of Dan Dennett, a lodestar\nin my life and in many thoughtful people\u2019s lives.\n\nDan was a deep thinker about what it is to be human. Quite early on, he\narrived at what many would see as shocking conclusions about consciousness\n(essentially that it is just an emergent effect of physical interactions of\ntiny inanimate components), and from then on, he was a dead-set opponent of\ndualism (the idea that there is an ethereal nonphysical elixir called\n\u201cconsciousness\u201d, over and above the physical events taking place in the\nenormously complex substrate of a human or animal brain, and perhaps that of a\nsilicon network as well). Dan thus totally rejected the notion of \u201cqualia\u201d\n(pure sensations of such things as colors, tastes, and so forth), and his\narguments against the mystique of qualia were subtle but very cogent.\n\nDan had many adversaries in the world of philosophers, but also quite a few\nwho shared his views, and as for myself, I was almost always aligned with him.\nOur only notable divergence was on the question of free will, which Dan\nmaintained exists, in some sense of \u201cfree\u201d, whereas I just agreed that \u201cwill\u201d\nexists, but maintained that there is no freedom in it. (Scott Kim joked that I\nbelieved in \u201cfree won\u2019t\u201d, which was very clever, but really the negation\nshould apply to \u201cfree\u201d rather than to \u201cwill\u201d.)\n\nDan was also a diligent and lifelong \u201cstudent\u201d (in the sense of \u201cstudier\u201d) of\nevolution, religion, artificial intelligence, computers in general, and even\nscience in general. He wrote extremely important and influential books on all\nthese topics, and his insights will endure as long as we humans endure. I\u2019m\nthinking of his booksBrainstorms; The Intentional Stance; Elbow Room;\nConsciousness Explained; Darwin\u2019s Dangerous Idea; Kinds of Minds; Inside\nJokes; Breaking the Spell; From Bacteria to Bach and Back; and of course his\nlast book, I\u2019ve Been Thinking, which was (and is) a very colorful self-\nportrait, a lovely autobiography vividly telling so many stories of his\nintercontinental life. I\u2019m so happy that Dan not only completed it but was\nable to savor its warm reception all around the world.\n\nAmong other things, that book tells about Dan\u2019s extremely rich life not just\nas a thinker but also as a doer. Dan was a true bon vivant, and he developed\nmany amazing skills, such as that of house-builder, folk-dancer and folk-dance\ncaller, jazz pianist, cider-maker, sailor and racer of yachts (not the big\nones owned by Russian oligarchs, but beautifully crafted sailboats), joke-\nteller par excellence, enthusiast for and expert in word games, savorer of\nmany cuisines and wines, wood-carver and sculptor, speaker of French and some\nGerman and Italian as well, and ardent and eloquent supporter of thinkers whom\nhe admired and felt were not treated with sufficient respect by the academic\nworld.\n\nDan was also a most devoted husband to his wife Susan \u2014 they were married for\nnigh-on sixty years \u2014 and a great dad to their two children, Peter and Andrea.\nHe entertained the kids by building all sorts of things for them, and he\nsupported them through thick and thin. I saw that from up close, and really\nadmired his ardent family spirit.\n\nBoth Dan and Susan had near misses with death over the past decade or two, and\non one of those occasions \u2014 his own close call when his aorta ruptured \u2014 he\nwrote a memorable essay called (if I recall correctly) \u201cThank Goodness\u201d, which\nwas all about how the human inventors and practitioners of modern medicine had\nsaved his life (and the lives of countless others), and that it was deeply\nwrong to \u201cthank God\u201d for saving anyone\u2019s life, and that what should be thanked\nwas human goodness incarnated in the form of all those people who so deeply\ncared about helping their fellow humans (nurses, doctors, medical researchers,\netc.). Although Dan understood why his religious friends prayed for him, he\nthought that such actions were profoundly misguided and that belief in divine\nintervention was not a healthy approach to life.\n\nLike his friends Christopher Hitchens, Sam Harris, and Richard Dawkins (the\nquartet was nicknamed \u201cthe four horsemen of the apocalypse\u201d), Dan was a\ncommitted atheist \u2014 and unlike me, he didn\u2019t shy away from applying that word\nto himself, with all its flavors of an aggressive anti-religion stance \u2014 and\nhe tried to explain, with great patience and subtlety, what is so compelling\nabout religion to the human mind, but what is at the same time, so wrong about\nit.\n\nProbably Dan\u2019s two greatest heroes were Charles Darwin and the philosopher\nGilbert Ryle (who was his doctoral advisor at Oxford), although he had quite a\nfew others (including, for example, Cole Porter and J. S. Bach). Dan had many\nfriends of many sorts in many lands all around the world, and I was proud to\nbe one of them. He and Susan loved hosting their friends at their farm in\nMaine, which they owned and operated for about 40 years, and Dan himself did\nmuch of (probably most of) the physical maintenance of the home and the fields\nand trees, learning a great deal from his Maine neighbors. Dan loved Maine and\nhe loved calling it \u201cDown East\u201d (as the Maine folks do), and he loved the\njargon he picked up from farming and from sailing, and he employed it often in\nhis writings (and I was often a bit thrown by some of the terms he dropped\nwith such ease and naturalness, as if everybody were as familiar with farm\nlife and the sailing life as he was). I once offhandedly called Dan a\n\u201ctillosopher\u201d, and he loved the epithet and even embraced it with delight in\nhis recent autobiography.\n\nDan was a bon vivant, a very zesty fellow, who loved travel and hobnobbing\nwith brilliance wherever he could find it. In his later years, as he grew a\nlittle teetery, he proudly carried a wooden cane with him all around the\nworld, and into it he chiseled words and images that represented the many\nplaces he visited and gave lectures at.\n\nDan was a truly faithful friend to me over the four-plus decades that we knew\neach other. He always supported my ideas, and I am proud that he often sought\nfeeback from me on drafts of manuscripts that he was writing, and I often\nprovided detailed suggestions. Seldom did I disagree with the thrust of his\nideas; I usually just provided suggestions for how to phrase a sentence a tad\nbit more clearly, or perhaps some examples that would support his point. I\u2019m\nproud that over the years, I moved him close to my position on the importance\nof using nonsexist language in one\u2019s speech and writing.\n\nSome of Dan\u2019s insightful essays, such as \u201cReal Patterns\u201d, which talked about\nwhat \u201cexists\u201d in the abstract two-dimensional world of John Conway\u2019s amazing\nGame of Life (and by analogy, about what \u201cexists\u201d in our 3-D physical world),\nwere deep mind-openers, as was of course his brilliant short story \u201cWhere Am\nI?\u201d (one chapter inBrainstorms), which led to our friendship and our intimate\ncollaboration on the anthologyThe Mind\u2019s I, way back in 1980 and 1981.\n\nDan appreciated me in ways that I will never forget, and he counseled me\nwisely and empathetically concerning romantic dilemmas during the year I was\non sabbatical in the Boston area. He was deeply considerate and compassionate,\nand as I say, filled to the brim with zest and enthusiasm. He was a great dad\nand a great husband and a great friend, as well as a great intellectual and a\ngreat writer. He was \u201cbigger than life\u201d, as my friend David Policansky\ndescribed him, one time when we together were guests at Susan and Dan\u2019s farm\nin the early 1980s.\n\nI personally will deeply miss Dan, and so will so many other thoughtful people\n\u2014 even people with whom Dan seriously disagreed, such as my old doctoral\nstudent Dave Chalmers, whose ideas on consciousness are diametrically opposed\nto Dan\u2019s, but their friendship was warm because they both valued honest human\ncontact and respect, and clear communication, far above such goals as fame or\npower or status.\n\nDan Dennett was a mensch, and his ideas on so many subjects will leave a\nlasting impact on the world, and his human presence has had a profound impact\non those of us who were lucky enough to know him well and to count him as a\nfriend.\n\nRequiescat in pace, Dan.\n\nYours,\n\nDoug.\n\n### Subscribe to Marcus on AI\n\nBy Gary Marcus \u00b7 Hundreds of paid subscribers\n\n\u201cAmongst the myriad of opinions, one voice stands out as a rational and\nimpartial advocate: Gary Marcus.\u201d \u2014Candice Clark\n\n156 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n17 Restacks\n\n156\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Daniel Dennett, 1942-2024\n\ngarymarcus.substack.com\n\n10\n\nShare\n\n10 Comments\n\nRoumen PopovRoumen\u2019s SubstackApr 20That sounds almost like a prophecy come\ntrue with regards to today's state of affairs (from Wikipedia):\"While\napproving of the increase in efficiency that humans reap by using resources\nsuch as expert systems in medicine or GPS in navigation, Dennett saw a danger\nin machines performing an ever-increasing proportion of basic tasks in\nperception, memory, and algorithmic computation because people may tend to\nanthropomorphize such systems and attribute intellectual powers to them that\nthey do not possess.
