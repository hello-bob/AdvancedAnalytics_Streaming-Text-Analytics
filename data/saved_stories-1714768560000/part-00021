But advocates say over the past year, a backlash fueled by a\nconservative think tank has gained steam.\n\nIowa is the latest Republican-led state to prohibit the use of public money\nfor so-called guaranteed income. The final vote last month wasn't close, but\nthe debate was heated. Senators who support such programs said it was\nundemocratic to undermine local governments. One suggested colleagues were\nbeing hypocritical, since their own families have received federal farm\nsubsidies for generations.\n\n### National\n\n### Places across the U.S. are testing no-strings cash as part of the social\nsafety net\n\nBut state Sen. Brad Zaun, who represents an area that's currently testing a\nbasic income pilot, said he was shocked when the program was approved. He\nslammed the notion of giving people free money without requiring them to work.\n\n\"Where before, neighbors and churches and nonprofits really stepped up, and\nhelped out people,\" he said, \"now it's becoming more dependent on government,\nand government tax dollars.\"\n\nIn Texas a similar bill to ban these programs didn't get far, so state Sen.\nPaul Bettencourt took a different tack. He persuaded the state attorney\ngeneral to file suit against a basic income program in Harris County, which\nincludes Houston.\n\n\"You just can't give out money on the street like popcorn, you have to have a\ngovernmental reason,\" he says, citing a gift clause in the state's\nconstitution.\n\nHarris County attorney Christian Menefee disputes that, arguing the program\nserves a public purpose of reducing poverty and increasing economic\nopportunity.\n\nThe Harris County pilot targets people who live in certain high-poverty ZIP\ncodes, a population that's disproportionally Black and Hispanic. More than\n82,000 people applied, then 1,900 were randomly selected to receive monthly\npayments.\n\nBeyond the constitutional question, Bettencourt says this method of picking a\nlucky few winners by lottery is bad policy. He also concedes it wouldn't be\npossible to pay everyone who met the requirement, saying, \"Even if you\nbelieved in the public policy, you just simply run out of money.\"\n\n### The backlash is a sign of how popular basic income programs have become\n\nBasic income pilots have exploded since the pandemic. In part, that's because\ncities are using federal pandemic relief money to fund them, along with\nphilanthropy, other private donors and tax dollars. They usually pay low-\nincome people $500 or $1,000 a month, for a year or so.\n\nThese pilots are \"helpful and effective for the families who need them\" says\nAditi Shrivastava, deputy director for Income Security at the Center on Budget\nand Policy Priorities. Research finds participants are more financially secure\nand less stressed out and that the monthly payments have no impact on\nemployment.\n\n### National\n\n### Every new mom in this U.S. city is now getting cash aid for a year\n\nThe lack of a work requirement is a selling point for supporters, who say the\nextra cash can create the time and space to find a better job or perhaps a new\ndirection. Most people are employed, though, often holding two jobs.\nShrivastava says those who don't work generally have good reason.\n\n\"They may be taking care of family members. They may be dealing with\ndisabilities,\" she says. \"What we do know is the people who can work are\nalready working.\"\n\n### A conservative think tank has ramped up lobbying for bans on cash aid\n\nIn addition to Iowa, three other states \u2014 Arkansas, Idaho and South Dakota \u2014\nhave banned no-strings cash aid. Lawmakers in Wisconsin and Arizona did too,\nbut Democratic governors vetoed those bills.\n\nSome states that banned basic income don't actually have such programs.\n\nAll of this is part of a coordinated push, says Harish Patel, a vice president\nwith the Economic Security Project, which advocates for guaranteed income. He\nsays the backlash is spearheaded by the lobbying arm of a conservative think\ntank, the Foundation for Government Accountability.\n\n\"They helicopter in, hire lobbyists in a bunch of states, and then they\nprovide these copycat bills to undo this very popular program,\" Patel says.\n\nThe FGA did not make someone available for an interview, but \u2014 among other\nissues \u2013 it promotes work requirements for federal safety net programs and\nopposes expanding Medicaid. During last year's congressional debt-ceiling\nnegotiations, its CEO suggested that new work requirements would ease worker\nshortages and decrease federal spending.\n\nThe FGA is also among the many conservative groups that have contributed to\nProject 2025, which aims to set the agenda for a second Trump presidential\nterm.\n\n### National\n\n### Rents are high and housing vouchers are hard to get. So Philly is giving\nrenters cash\n\nOver the past year, a total of 10 states have introduced bills to ban basic\nincome. \"We think that in the next year they're probably going to go to 25 to\n30 states, because they tested it out,\" Patel says. \"People are going to stand\nup and fight back.\"\n\nPatel says his group's not-yet-published polling finds majority support for\nbasic income among not just Democrats, but also independents and younger\nRepublicans. Democratic pollster Celinda Lake has found broad support for the\nidea of a federal guaranteed income program, something many advocates say is\ntheir ultimate goal.\n\n### The Texas legal challenge has had immediate consequences\n\nIowa's cash aid pilot has said it should be able to continue through its final\npayment in April 2025, since much of its funding is from private groups. But\nthe lawsuit in Harris County, Texas, has had immediate consequences.\n\nLast month, the Texas Supreme Court temporarily blocked the program a day\nbefore the first $500 payments were supposed to go out. That's left 56-year-\nold Carmela Valdez Nunez anxious and desperate.\n\n\"I just got to pay my rent and my bills,\" she says. \"That's the thing I need,\nbecause I don't want to be under the freeway.\"\n\n### Law\n\n### Supreme Court appears to side with an Oregon city's crackdown on\nhomelessness\n\nShe thanks God she's never been homeless, but is behind on bills and worries\nabout it a lot. Valdez Nunez used to clean offices and care for seniors. But\nshe's disabled now and says she barely gets by on Social Security, a housing\nvoucher and $23 a month in food aid.\n\n\"I just buy eggs, like tomato, onions, bread, bologna and cheese. That's all I\nhave enough to buy,\" she says, and it only lasts a week.\n\nValdez Nunez says she's gotten used to enduring hunger for long stretches. If\nthe basic income program is allowed to go through, the first thing she'll buy\nis food.\n\n###### Read & Listen\n\n  * Home\n  * News\n  * Culture\n  * Music\n  * Podcasts & Shows\n\n###### Connect\n\n  * Newsletters\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * Press\n  * Public Editor\n  * Corrections\n  * Contact & Help\n\n###### About NPR\n\n  * Overview\n  * Diversity\n  * NPR Network\n  * Accessibility\n  * Ethics\n  * Finances\n\n###### Get Involved\n\n  * Support Public Radio\n  * Sponsor NPR\n  * NPR Careers\n  * NPR Shop\n  * NPR Events\n  * NPR Extra\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy\n  * Your Privacy Choices\n  * Text Only\n  * \u00a9 2024 npr\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor\n\n## Cookie Consent & Sponsorship Choices\n\nWe and our 165 partners store and/or access information on a device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies to process personal data.
