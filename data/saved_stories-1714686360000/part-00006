We removed from this analysis 4,279 boot drives, consisting of 3,307\nSSDs and 972 hard drives. This leaves us with 279,572 hard drives under\nmanagement to examine for this report. We\u2019ll review their annualized failure\nrates (AFRs) as of Q1 2024, and we\u2019ll dig into the average age of drive\nfailure by model, drive size, and more. Along the way, we\u2019ll share our\nobservations and insights on the data presented and, as always, we look\nforward to you doing the same in the comments section at the end of the post.\n\n## Hard Drive Failure Rates for Q1 2024\n\nWe analyzed the drive stats data of 279,572 hard drives. In this group we\nidentified 275 individual drives which exceeded their manufacturer\u2019s\ntemperature specification at some point in their operational life. As such,\nthese drives were removed from our AFR calculations.\n\nThe remaining 279,297 drives were divided into two groups. The primary group\nconsists of the drive models which had at least 100 drives in operation as of\nthe end of the quarter and accumulated over 10,000 drive days during the same\nquarter. This group consists of 278,656 drives grouped into 29 drive models.\nThe secondary group contains the remaining 641 drives which did not meet the\ncriteria noted. We will review the secondary group later in this post, but for\nthe moment let\u2019s focus on the primary group.\n\nFor Q1 2024, we analyzed 278,656 hard drives grouped into 29 drive models. The\ntable below lists the AFRs of these drive models. The table is sorted by drive\nsize then AFR, and grouped by drive size.\n\n### Notes and Observations on the Q1 2024 Drive Stats\n\n  * Downward AFR: The AFR for Q1 2024 was 1.41%. That\u2019s down from Q4 2023 at 1.53%, and also down from one year ago (Q1 2023) at 1.54%. The continuing process of replacing older 4TB drives is a primary driver of this decrease as the Q1 2024 AFR (1.36%) for the 4TB drive cohort is down from a high of 2.33% in Q2 2023.\n  * A Few Good Zeroes: In Q1 2024, three drive models had zero failures:\n\n    * 16TB Seagate (model: ST16000NM002J)\n\n      * Q1 2024 drive days: 42,133\n      * Lifetime drive days: 216,019\n      * Lifetime AFR: 0.68%\n      * Lifetime confidence interval: 1.4%\n    * 8TB Seagate (model: ST8000NM000A)\n\n      * Q1 2024 drive days: 19,684\n      * Lifetime drive days: 106,759\n      * Lifetime AFR: 0.00%\n      * Lifetime confidence interval: 1.9%\n    * 6TB Seagate (model: ST6000DX000)\n\n      * Q1 2024 drive days: 80,262\n      * Lifetime drive days: 4,268,373\n      * Lifetime AFR: 0.86%\n      * Lifetime confidence interval: 0.3%\n\nAll three drives have a lifetime AFR of less than 1%, but in the case of the\n8TB and 16TB drive models the confidence interval (95%) is still too high.\nWhile it is possible the two drives models will continue to perform well, we\u2019d\nlike to see the confidence interval below 1%, and preferably below 0.5%,\nbefore we can trust the lifetime AFR.\n\nWith a confidence interval of 0.3% the 6TB Seagate drives delivered another\nquarter of zero failures. At an average age of nine years, these drives\ncontinue to defy their age. They were purchased and installed at the same time\nback in 2015, and are members of the only 6TB Backblaze Vault still in\noperation.\n\n  * The End of the Line: The 4TB Toshiba (model: MD04ABA400V) are not in the Q1 2024 Drive Stats tables. This was not an oversight. The last of these drives became a migration target early in Q1 and their data was securely transferred to pristine 16TB Toshiba drives. They rivaled the 6TB Seagate drives in age and AFR, but their number was up and it was time to go.\n\n### The Secondary Group\n\nAs noted previously, we divided the drive models into two groups, primary and\nsecondary, with drive count (>100) and drive days (>10,000) being the metrics\nused to divide the groups. The secondary group has a total of 641 drives\nspread across 27 drive models. Below is a table of those drive models.\n\nThe secondary group is mostly made up of drive models which are replacement\ndrives or migration candidates. Regardless, the lack of observations (drive\ndays) over the observation period is too low to have any certainty about the\ncalculated AFR.\n\nFrom time to time, a secondary drive model will move into the primary group.\nFor example, the 14TB Seagate (model: ST14000NM000J) will most likely have\nover 100 drives and 10,000 drive days in Q2. The reverse is also possible,\nespecially as we continue to migrate our 4TB drive models.\n\n### Why Have a Secondary Group?\n\nIn practice we\u2019ve always had two groups; we just didn\u2019t name them. Previously,\nwe would eliminate from the quarterly, annual, and lifetime AFR charts drive\nmodels which did not have at least 45 drives, then we upped that to 60 drives.\nThis was okay, but we realized that we needed to also set a minimum number of\ndrive days over the analysis period to improve our confidence in the AFRs we\ncalculated. To that end, we have set the following thresholds for drive models\nto be in the primary group.\n\nReview Period| Drive Count per Model| Drive Days per Model  \n---|---|---  \nQuarterly| >100 drives| >10,000 drive days  \nAnnual| >250 drives| >50,000 drives days  \nLifetime| >500 drives| >100,000 drive days  \n  \nWe will evaluate these metrics as we go along and change them if needed. The\ngoal is to continue to provide AFRs that we are confident are an accurate\nreflection of the drives in our environment.\n\n## The Average Age of Drive Failure Redux\n\nIn Q1 2023 Drive Stats report, we took a look at the average age in which a\ndrive fails. This review was inspired by the folks at Secure Data Recovery who\ncalculated that based on their analysis of 2,007 failed drives, the average\nage at which they failed was 1,051 days or roughly 2 years and 10 months.\n\nWe applied the same approach to our 17,155 failed drives and were surprised\nwhen our average age of failure was only 2 years and 6 months. Then we\nrealized that many of the drive models that were still in use were older (much\nolder) than the average, and surely when some number of them failed, it would\naffect the average age of failure for a given drive model.\n\nTo account for this realization, we considered only those drive models that\nare no longer active in our production environment. We call this collection\nretired drive models as these are drives that can no longer age or fail. When\nwe reviewed the average age of this retired group of drives, the average age\nof failure was 2 years and 7 months. Unexpected, yes, but we decided we needed\nmore data before reaching any conclusions.\n\nSo, here we are a year later to see if the average age of drive failure we\ncomputed in Q1 2023 has changed. Let\u2019s dig in.\n\nAs before we recorded the date, serial_number, model, drive_capacity, failure,\nand SMART 9 raw value for all of the failed drives we have in the Drive Stats\ndataset back to April 2013. The SMART 9 raw value gives us the number of hours\nthe drive was in operation. Then we removed boot drives and drives with\nincomplete data, that is some of the values were missing or wildly inaccurate.\nThis left us with 17,155 failed drives as of Q1 2023.\n\nOver this past year, Q2 2023 through Q1 2024, we recorded an additional 4,406\nfailed drives. There were 173 drives which were either boot drives or had\nincomplete data, leaving us with 4,233 drives to add to the 17,155 failed\ndrives previous, totalling 21,388 failed drives to evaluate.\n\nWhen we compare Q1 2023 to Q1 2024 we get the table below.\n\nThe average age of failure for all of the Backblaze drive models (2 years and\n10 months) matches the Secure Data Recovery baseline. The question is, does\nthat validate their number? We say, not yet. Why? Two primary reasons.\n\nFirst, we only have two data points, so we don\u2019t have much of a trend, that is\nwe don\u2019t know if the alignment is real or just temporary. Second, the average\nage of failure of the active drive models (that is, those in production) is\nnow already higher (2 years and 11 months) than the Secure Data baseline. If\nthat trend were to continue, then when the active drive models retire, they\nwill likely increase the average age of failure of the drive models that are\nnot in production.\n\nThat said, we can compare the numbers by drive size and drive model from Q1\n2023 to Q1 2024 to see if we can gain any additional insights. Let\u2019s start\nwith the average age by drive size in the table below.\n\nThe most salient observation is that for every drive size that had active\ndrive models (green), the average age of failure increased from Q1 2023 to Q1\n2024. Given that the overall average age of failure increased over the last\nyear, it is reasonable to expect that some of the active drive size cohorts\nwould increase. With that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at the changes by drive\nmodel over the same period.\n\nStarting with the retired drive models, there were three drive models\ntotalling 196 drives which moved from active to retired from Q1 2023 to Q1\n2024. Still, the average age of failure for the retired drive cohort remained\nat 2 years 7 months, so we\u2019ll spare you from looking at a chart with 39 drive\nmodels where over 90% of the data didn\u2019t change Q1 2023 to Q1 2024.\n\nOn the other hand, the active drive models are a little more interesting, as\nwe can see below.\n\nIn all but the two drive models (highlighted), the average age of failure for\neach drive model went up. In other words, active drive models are, on average,\nolder when they fail, than one year ago. Remember, we are testing the average\nage of the drive failures, not the average age of the drive.\n\nAt this point, let\u2019s review. The Secure Data Recovery folks checked 2,007\nfailed drives and determined their average age of failure was 2 years and 10\nmonths. We are testing that assertion. At the moment, the average age of\nfailure for the retired drive models (those no longer in operation in our\nenvironment) is 2 years and 7 months. This is still less than the Secure Data\nnumber. But, the drive models still in operation are now hitting an average of\n2 years and 10 months, suggesting that once these drive models are removed\nfrom service, the average age of failure for the retired drive models will\nincrease.\n\nBased on all of this, we think the average age of failure for our retired\ndrive models will eventually exceed 2 years and 10 months. Further, we predict\nthat the average age of failure will reach closer to 4 years for the retired\ndrive models once our 4TB drive models are removed from service.\n\n## Annualized Failures Rates for Manufacturers\n\nAs we noted at the beginning of this report, the quarterly AFR for Q1 2024 was\n1.41%. Each of the four manufacturers we track contributed to the overall AFR\nas shown in the chart below.\n\nAs you can see, the overall AFR for all drives peaked in Q3 2023 and is\ndropping. This is mostly due to the retirement of older 4TB drives that are\nfurther along the bathtub curve of drive failure. Interestingly, all of the\nremaining 4TB drives in use today are either Seagate or HGST models.\nTherefore, we expect the quarterly AFR will most likely continue to decrease\nfor those two manufacturers as over the next year their 4TB drive models will\nbe replaced.\n\n## Lifetime Hard Drive Failure Rates\n\nAs of the end of Q1 2024, we were tracking 279,572 operational hard drives. As\nnoted earlier, we defined the minimum eligibility criteria of a drive model to\nbe included in our analysis for quarterly, annual and lifetime reviews. To be\nconsidered for the lifetime review, a drive model was required to have 500 or\nmore drives as of the end of Q1 2024 and have over 100,000 accumulated drive\ndays during their lifetime. When we removed those drive models which did not\nmeet the lifetime criteria, we had 277,910 drives grouped into 26 models\nremaining for analysis as shown in the tale below.\n\nWith three exceptions, the conference interval for each drive model is 0.5% or\nless at 95% certainty. For the three exceptions: the 10TB Seagate, the 14TB\nSeagate, and 14TB Toshiba models, the occurrence of drive failure from quarter\nto quarter was too variable over their lifetime. This volatility has a\nnegative effect on the confidence interval.\n\nThe combination of a low lifetime AFR and a small confidence interval is\nhelpful in identifying the drive models which work well in our environment.\nThese days we are interested mostly in the larger drives as replacements,\nmigration targets, or new installations. Using the table above, let\u2019s see if\nwe can identify our best 12, 14, and 16TB performers. We\u2019ll skip reviewing the\n22TB drives as we only have one model.\n\nThe drive models are grouped by drive size, then sorted by their Lifetime AFR.\nLet\u2019s take a look at each of those groups.\n\n  * 12TB drive models: The three 12TB HGST models are great performers, but are hard to find new. Also, Western Digital, who purchased the HGST drive business a while back, has started using their own model numbers of these drives, so it can be confusing. If you do find an original HGST make sure it is new as from our perspective buying a refurbished drive is not the same as buying a new.\n  * 14TB drive models: The first three models look to be solid\u2014the WDC (WUH721414ALE6L4), Toshiba (MG07ACA14TA), and Seagate (ST14000NM001G). The remaining two drive models have mediocre lifetime AFRs and undesirable confidence intervals.\n  * 16TB drive models: Lots of choice here, with all six drive models performing well to this point, although the WDC models are the best of the best to date.\n\n## The Hard Drive Stats Data\n\nIt has now been eleven years since we began recording, storing and reporting\nthe operational statistics of the hard drives and SSDs we use to store data in\nthe Backblaze data storage cloud. We look at the telemetry data of the drives,\nincluding their SMART stats and other health related attributes. We do not\nread or otherwise examine the actual customer data stored.\n\nOver the years, we have analyzed the data we have gathered and published our\nfindings and insights from our analyses. For transparency, we also publish the\ndata itself, known as the Drive Stats dataset. This dataset is open source and\ncan be downloaded from our Drive Stats webpage.\n\nYou can download and use the Drive Stats dataset for free for your own\npurpose. All we ask are three things: 1) you cite Backblaze as the source if\nyou use the data, 2) you accept that you are solely responsible for how you\nuse the data, and 3) you do not sell this data to anyone; it is free.\n\nGood luck and let us know if you find anything interesting.\n\nprint\n\nPublished May 2, 2024\n\nCategorized as Cloud Storage, Featured, Featured-Cloud Storage, Hard Drive\nStats Tagged B2Cloud\n\n## About Andy Klein\n\nAndy Klein is the Principal Cloud Storage Storyteller at Backblaze.
