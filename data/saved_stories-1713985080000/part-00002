So what else was hidden in\nthere?\n\nMar 31st, 2024 10:00am by Joab Jackson\n\nJiaT75\u2019s GitHub account.\n\nVOXPOP\n\nTry our new 5 second poll. It's fast. And it's fun!\n\nTech Conferences: Does Your Employer Pay?\n\nDoes your employer pay for you to attend tech conferences?\n\nYes, registration and travel are comped.\n\nYes, just registration but not travel expenses.\n\nYes, travel expenses but not registration.\n\nOnly virtual conferences.\n\nNo reimbursement.\n\nWe'd love to hear what you think.\n\nWhen your home has been broken into, you may not initially comprehend all that\nhas been taken, or the damage that has been done. This is the state of\napprehension the Linux community now feels with the recently-unearthed xz\nbackdoor security vulnerability.\n\n\u201cThis upstream supply chain security attack is the kind of nightmare scenario\nthat has gotten people describing it called hysterical for years,\u201d Kubernetes\nSecurity Chairperson Ian Coldwater had written on X. \u201cIt\u2019s real.\u201d\n\nA Microsoft engineer first detected the back door, which he traced back to a\nrecent update to the xz compression library. The library update was a recent\none, but it already found homes in the rolling and advanced \u201crapid\u201d releases\nof some Linux distributions.\n\nThe back door takes a certain combination of conditions and dependencies to\ntrigger. Once triggered, however, an attacker could enter your system without\nany authentication at all.\n\nThe errant code has been quickly expunged, but now questions linger as to the\npotential damage this backdoor has already caused \u2014 as well as who planted\nthis subterfuge, and what their intentions were.\n\nEven more concerning is the possibility of other heretofore undiscovered\nbackdoors that have been planted in this library, or have taken root in\nearlier versions of the library that many more servers are still using.\n\n## If It Weren\u2019t for One Nosey Engineer...\n\nThank God for engineers geeky enough to debug a slow log-in time on their SSH\nsession.\n\nTRENDING STORIES\n\n  1. 5 Steps Toward Military-Grade API Security\n  2. Best Practices for Storing Access Tokens in the Browser\n  3. Linux xz Backdoor Damage Could Be Greater Than Feared\n  4. Bjarne Stroustrup's Plan for Bringing Safety to C++\n  5. Lessons Learned about Secrets Protection after the Sisense Breach\n\nAndres Freund, a principal software engineer at Microsoft, had noticed his\nremote ssh log-in took 500ms longer than it should have. He traced the latency\nto a system call that SSH made, for some reason, to the liblzma compression\nlibrary, which is included with the xz utility embedded in Freund\u2019s Debian sid\ninstallation.\n\nHe tracked down the backdoor code in the xz utility tarball for that Debian\nused in the installation process \u2014 though they were not in the original GitHub\nsource code for the library.\n\nThe extra baggage was an obsfucated script that would get executed at the end\nof the configuration setup for the tarballs.\n\nFreund reported the foul tarball to Debian Security and then to the\ndistributer\u2019s channel. Red Hat submitted this issue as CVE-2024-3094, ranking\nit with a severity of 10.\n\nThat this injection of seemingly malicious code happened so far upstream in\nthe Linux release cycle for concerned Freund.\n\n\u201cGiven the activity over several weeks, the committer is either directly\ninvolved or there was some quite severe compromise of their system.\nUnfortunately the latter looks like the less likely explanation, given they\ncommunicated on various lists about the \u2018fixes\u2019 mentioned above,\u201d he wrote.\n\n## Who Is Jia Tan?\n\nRichard WM Jones, a Red Hat engineer, had been in contact with the apparent\nauthor of the backdoor, he relayed on Hacker News.\n\nThe contributor, who went by the name of Jia Tan, had been \u201ctrying to get xz\n5.6.x added to Fedora 40 & 41\u201d because of its \u201c\u2018great new features.'\u201d\n\nZoom\n\nFrom Jia Tan\u2019s GitHub account.\n\n\u201cHe has been part of the xz project for 2 years, adding all sorts of binary\ntest files, and to be honest with this level of sophistication I would be\nsuspicious of even older versions of xz until proven otherwise,\u201d Jones wrote.\n\nIt was found that the XZ Utils 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 release tarballs that contain\nthe backdoor. Both were created and signed by Jia Tan (JiaT75).\n\nJia Tan is likely a pseudonym, noted security expert Michal Zalewski,\nexplaining that the persona appeared apparently out of nowhere in 2021.\n\nWith no previous activity under this handle, JiaT75 signed up for GitHub in\n2021 and went to work immediately on the projects on the xz utilities. The\naccount has no identifying information beyond a Gmail address.\n\nThe xz chief maintainer has Lasse Collin (Larhzu), who has been with the\nproject since its inception. He has typically signed the xz tarballs (a bundle\nof multiple files) for distribution. He let Tan handle these last few\nreleases, however.\n\nHow much Collin knows about Tan is not clear. Just prior to this mess, Collin\nlogged off the internet, in an online sabbatical, hopping on only once to post\na short response on the project site.\n\nZaleski\u2019s sleuthing had found that Collin in the past few years had been\nbeleaguered by trolls hounding him to step down from his post as xz\nadministrator.\n\nZoom\n\nTrolling the xz maintainer to step down.\n\nIn one message, Collin admitted that he had little time of late to keep up\nwith the growing backlog of issues. \u201cSomething has to change in the long\nterm,\u201d he wrote, adding that he looked to Tan taking on more duties as time\npassed.\n\nZaleski suspects that JiaT75\u2019s work, given its general high quality, is not\none of a hobbyist.\n\n\u201cAll signs point to this being a professional, for-pay operation,\u201d perhaps\neven one by a foreign government, Zaleski surmised.\n\nOther security experts seem to concur on the overall sophistication of the\ninjected code:\n\n\u201cThis might be the best-executed supply chain attack we\u2019ve seen described in\nthe open, and it\u2019s a nightmare scenario: malicious, competent, authorized\nupstream in a widely used library,\u201d wrote Filippo Valsorda, an open source\nmaintainer, on BlueSky.\n\nJia Tan only had access to the xz files hosted on GitHub; Collin retains\ncontrol of the website. For safety, GitHub has since disabled all the xz\nutility repositories, and suspended the accounts of both Tan and Collin.\n\n## Is the xz Backdoor Planted on your Linux Server?\n\nIf you run Linux or the macOS systems you most likely have some version of the\nxz and the liblzma dependencies, which are needed to uncompress software\npackages for installation and updates.\n\nThus far, it is mostly rolling release and rapid update distributions that\nhave ingested XZ Utils 5.6.0 and 5.6.1, such as Fedora Linux 40 and Fedora\nRawhide and the Debian advanced distributions.\n\nUbuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat) also contained the infected files, which have\nsince been removed. Advisories were also issued by Arch and openSUSE.\n\nRed Hat has reported no versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux have been\ncompromised.\n\nThe backdoor appears to be triggered only through a select set of conditions:\nthrough a \u201cremote unprivileged systems connecting to public SSH ports,\u201d\naccording to a za-utils backdoor FAQ posted by Gentoo Linux developer Sam\nJames.\n\nIn addition to having either the 5.6.0 or 5.6.1 tarball installed, the exploit\nalso has to be a Linux distribution running on AMD64 hardware, and uses the\nglibc library (such as all those Debian and Red Hat-derived versions).\n\nA combination of systemd and a patched openssh also seems to be a requirement\nfor the backdoor.\n\nThe payload gets triggered by a running version of the sshd daemon in\n/usr/sbin/. The malicious code actually gets embedded into sshd itself, thanks\nto a recent sshd patch to support systemd-notify allowing other services\n\u2014including liblzma \u2014 to be alerted when sshd is running.\n\nOnce inside ssdh, the payload then redirects sshd\u2019s decryption function to\nbypass user authentication.\n\n\u201cOther systems may be vulnerable at this time, but we don\u2019t know,\u201d James\nwrote.\n\nRed Hat warned its users of the severity of the compromise:\n\n\u201cUnder the right circumstances, this interference could potentially enable a\nmalicious actor to break sshd authentication and gain unauthorized access to\nthe entire system remotely.\u201d\n\n## How Many xz Backdoors Could There Be?\n\nGiven these conditions listed above, if you are running a server instance of a\npublicly accessible SSH, James advised that you should \u201cUpdate RIGHT NOW NOW\nNOW.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that the knowledge about the backdoor triggers and versions they\ninfect are extremely limited at this point.\n\n\u201cWhile not scaremongering, it is important to be clear that at this stage, we\ngot lucky, and there may well be other effects of the infected liblzma,\u201d James\nwrote.\n\nFor one, JiaT75 could have planted other, better-hidden, backdoors into\nearlier versions of xz during his tenure, which goes back to at least to\nv5.3.1?\n\nThis would mean, of course, that a much larger pool of Linux distros could be\naffected.\n\nThe U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is currently\ninvestigating the backdoor further, according to Red Hat.\n\nThe good news is that it could have been worse: Vanilla upstream OpenSSH isn\u2019t\naffected \u2014 unless liblzma is added as a dependency.\n\nNonetheless, OpenSUSE recommends its Tumbleweed users reinstall SSH for\npublic-facing servers, as there can be no telling if those servers have\nalready been compromised.\n\nAt any rate, how the backdoor got so close to so many production systems may\nbe a cautionary tale over the state of the internet infrastructure.\n\n\u201cI do however think that this should mean an end to the practice of preferring\nmanually built upstream tarballs over pulling in git sources directly that\ndistributions such as Debian have espoused,\u201d one commenter noted on LXN.net.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the one weak link where few eyes exist in an otherwise pretty\nreproducible pipeline and it was really only a question of time until someone\ntook advantage of it.\u201d\n\nJoab Jackson is a senior editor for The New Stack, covering cloud native\ncomputing and system operations.
