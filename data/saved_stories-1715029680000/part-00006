It was originally contained in what was called\n\"The Hexagon System\" in which S73-7, the smaller satellite, was deployed from\nthe larger KH-9 Hexagon once in space. S73-7 measured 26 inches wide (66\ncentimeters) and began its life heading into a 500 mile (800 kilometers)\ncircular orbit.\n\nWhile in orbit, the original plan was for S73-7 to inflate and take on the\nrole as a calibration target for remote sensing equipment. After this failed\nto be achieved during deployment, the satellite faded away into the abyss and\njoined the graveyard of unwanted space junk until it was rediscovered in\nApril.\n\nIn an interview with Gizmodo, Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist from the\nHarvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, shared he had studied the data\narchives and discovered that before the recent finding, it had gone off the\ngrid from radar not once but twice \u2014 once in the 1970s and then again in the\n1990s.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM space\n\nRelated: Wow!

By using ground-\nbased radar as well as optical sensors, space junk can be tracked and when\nappropriate put into a satellite catalogue, but determining exactly what each\nitem is has challenges. The sensors can pick up on an object in orbit but then\nit has to be matched with a satellite that's also on the same path.\n\n## Get the Space.com Newsletter\n\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events\nand more!\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\"If you've got a recent orbital data set, and there's not too many things that\nare similar orbit, it's probably an easy match,\" McDowell said. \"But if it's a\nvery crowded bit of parameter space, and you haven't seen it for a while, then\nit's not so easy to match up.\"\n\nA National Reconnaissance Office illustration of a KH-9 Hexagon satellite and\nits basic systems.

With this information in the log,\nthey can take a look back at the progression and compare it to where the\nsatellite was last reported. However, to throw a wrench into that, if there's\nare any alteration to the original maneuvering plans or if a satellite drifts\nin orbit, engineers have more work to do to find it again.\n\n\"If you don't know exactly where the maneuver was, you may have trouble\nlocating it,\" McDowell said. \"If I rewind the orbit of an object and fast\nforward for the missing object, do they meet and is the point where they meet\nwhere the maneuver happened?\"\n\nThat's why a discovery like this is a win for the men and women trying to keep\ntrack of the tens of thousands of lost satellites and other debris orbiting\nour planet. But as more and more satellites head into space, the task will\nbecome even greater to know what exactly is out there and what threats that\ncould pose.\n\n\"If you're missing one or two objects, that's not a huge risk,\" McDowell told\nGizmodo. \"But you want to do as good a job as you can.\"\n\nJoin our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky\nand more!
