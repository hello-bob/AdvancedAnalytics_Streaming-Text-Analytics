Running\nsmoothly at 50 Hz, effortlessly rotating in full overscan and in 1\u00d71\nresolution, moving around the screen, arbitrarily zooming \u2013 awesome!\n\nThis calls for some poking around in the debugger to see how the sausage is\nmade! Here, the dynamic copperlists are overwritten with a static one,\ndisabling double buffering and Copper updates:\n\nAha! So, it\u2019s not a full three-way skew, but a combination of vertical skew,\nhorizontal skew, and vertical squeezing. Also, the zoom effect is an artefact\nof this approach \u2013 that didn\u2019t occur to me when I watched the demo live, in\nawe, so kudos for the presentation!\n\nOriginal\n\nVertical\n\nHorizontal\n\nSqueeze\n\nOf course, that is still scratching the surface, with a lot of clever\nimplementation details to be unearthed: Is the vertical skewing all done by\nthe Blitter? How can it rotate so fast at times, going back and forth? How\nmany buffers are used, and how? Is the dynamic viewport adaption when moving\nthe whole screen a show-off or necessary to keep running at full frame-rate?\n\nThankfully, Jobbo/Cosmic Orbs provides an excellent technical write-up,\nanswering most of these questions:\n\n  * Backslide \u2013 Technical Details How the 1\u00d71 rotator sausage is made, and other tasty sausages demo parts\n\nHuff in an Elevator\n\n### Blog\n\n  * Apr 2024 \u2013 6\n\n    * Skew this!\n    * Huff in an Elevator\n    * I\u2019m planning a room, what does it look like?\n    * Sunday reading: web design tech lore\n    * Retro-Fonts auf TikTok\n    * WarGames, the JIF\n  * Mar 2024 \u2013 4\n  * Feb 2024 \u2013 9\n  * Jan 2024 \u2013 10\n  * Dec 2023 \u2013 8\n  * Nov 2023 \u2013 1\n  * Oct 2023 \u2013 5\n  * Sep 2023 \u2013 5\n  * Aug 2023 \u2013 8\n  * Jul 2023 \u2013 1\n  * Apr 2023 \u2013 1\n\n### Recently updated pages\n\n  * Shall we play a game?\n  * Worms VBI\n  * strss\n  * Modding the Amiga boot hand\n  * rotz\n  * Familiar Feces\n  * Amiga BBS ANSI animations\n  * wchrmas pattern\n  * Super Santa Brothers\n  * Bitte hier das mit den...\n\n### Categories\n\n  * Amiga Style\n  * Berichte\n  * Computer Stuff\n  * Demo Scene\n  * Fernseh\n  * Fotos\n  * Informatik\n  * Komische Bilders\n  * Teletext\n  * Website Stuff\n  * DE\n\n### What the heckmeck?\n\n  * Home\n  * Blog\n  * Sitemap\n  * Teasers\n  * Impressum\n  * Random\n\n\u00a9 2024 Alexander Grupe \u00b7 Twitter \u00b7 GitHub \u00b7 Impressum \u00b7 Sitemap\n\neie\n\n", "frontpage": false}
