I am all enraged.\n\nDisappoint is a sober word here. I am actually pissed at the casual arrogance\nof Ubuntu and its parent company Canonical.\n\nPlease excuse the language, but I just cannot express my disgust any other\nway.\n\nWhat's the issue? Well, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS is here and it will stay for more\nthan the usual 5 years of long-term support period.\n\nFor years, Ubuntu has been promoting its 'universal packaging format' Snaps\nover 'Universal Operating System' Debian's deb packages.\n\nBut it has gone to the next level in the recent release of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.\n\n## Ubuntu's official app store won't install deb files\n\nActually, it started with the previous version Ubuntu 23.10.\n\nIf you download a .deb package of a software, you cannot install it using the\nofficial graphical software center on Ubuntu anymore.\n\nWhen you double-click on the downloaded deb package, you'll see this error,\n'there is no app installed for Debian package files'.\n\nCanonical's Ubuntu 24.04 pretends to not know what to do with deb files\n\nIf you right-click and choose to open it with Software Center, you are in for\nanother annoyance.\n\nThe software center will go into eternal loading. It may look as if it is\ndoing something, but it will go on forever. I could even livestream the\nloading app store on YouTube, and it would continue for the 12 years of its\nlong-term support period \ud83d\ude15\n\nUbuntu app store keeps on loading without even showing any error message\n\nAnd this is not just a simple bug they forgot to fix. They deliberately\nignored it.\n\n## Canonical has no intention of fixing it\n\nAn issue was opened on GitHub in Sep'23 when Ubuntu 23.10 was in beta.\nCanonical did not fix it for Ubuntu 23.10 release.\n\nAnd six months later, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS is released and Canonical has still not\nfixed this bug.\n\nThat's because the so-called bug for us, the public, is most likely a feature\ncrafted by them, Canonical folks.\n\nOtherwise, Ubuntu developer won't say that they \"didn't have capacity to work\non it\".\n\n> Unfortunately we didn't have the capacity to work on this for 24.04, but it\n> will be a priority for the next cycle!\n\nThis is a lame excuse. Who would believe that? Not me, for sure.\n\nIt's a stalling tactic. The bug was noticed by users for months and yet, it\nwas not fixed.\n\nThe entire point of these intermediate releases in-between the LTS ones is to\ntest things out. Clearly, there was no intent to fix it while the end users,\nspecially the new users, kept on struggling with this error.\n\n## Please don't say\" it's not a big deal, Abhi, you could always use Gdebi,\nEddy or the terminal\"\n\nYes, I know all this. I rarely even use the graphical app store. But it's not\nabout me who has been using Linux, primarily Ubuntu, for the last 15 years.\nIt's about people who are new to Ubuntu, people who are escaping Microsoft\nWindows. People who are not technically advanced but want to use this 'free'\noperating system.\n\nImagine that you are absolutely new to Linux but want to use it on your\npersonal computer instead of Windows. You read websites like It's FOSS where\nUbuntu is recommended to beginners.\n\nYou ask me if it is possible to use popular tools like Chrome on Ubuntu. I say\nyes. Just download it from the official website and install it by double-\nclicking like you do it with exe files in Windows.\n\nOnly this time, you encounter this error, you search the web and learn that\nyou have to install another tool or use the command line to install a simple\nbrowser.\n\nThis is not an ideal first experience for a beginner.\n\n## Ubuntu is cleverly booting out deb in favor of Snap, one baby step at a\ntime\n\nBy the way, before Ubuntu 20.04, you could just double-click on the deb files,\nand it would be opened in the software center for installation. Starting with\nUbuntu 20.04, this behavior was cunningly changed.\n\nDouble-clicking the deb file would open it with Archive manager.\n\nStarting with Ubuntu 20.04, double clicking behavior on deb file got changed\n\nYou could still double-click on it and choose to open deb file with Software\nCenter for the current file and the future ones.\n\nYou could still open deb file with Software Center which is not possible\nanymore\n\nI didn't pay enough attention to why this behavior wasn't changed back, but\nnow it seems like this too was a deliberate move.\n\nAnd then, there is also the issue of replacing deb packages with Snap, even\nwith the apt command line tool. You use 'sudo apt install chromium', you get a\nSnap package of Chromium instead of Debian. And that's just one of several\nsuch snappily replaced applications in this way.\n\n## Bottom line\n\nI understand that Canonical has every right to make the decision about their\nproduct. You want to promote Snap over Deb, fine. But don't do it in a\ndeceiving manner.\n\nIf you would like to keep your 'Snap store' deb-free, fine! At least have the\ndecency to provide Gdebi by default for local deb file installation.\n\nOtherwise, it is extremely disappointing to see this sheer disregard for the\nuser experience. And this is coming from a devoted Ubuntu user for the past 15\nyears.\n\nUbuntu rose to popularity because it made Linux simpler for the end user.\n'Linux for human beings' was its motto. I don't see this motto mentioned\nanywhere now. I wonder if that too is deliberate.\n\n## More from It's FOSS...\n\n  * Support us by opting for It's FOSS Plus membership.\n  * Join our community forum.\n  * \ud83d\udce9 Stay updated with the latest on Linux and Open Source.
