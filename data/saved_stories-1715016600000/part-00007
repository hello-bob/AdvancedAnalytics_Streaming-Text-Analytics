I aim to\nwrite my newsletter issues in a way one can follow them while traveling on a\nbus, having a coffee, waiting for your food, etc. Let's jump in!\n\n## How are Google Maps generated?\n\nCollecting Satellite imagery\n\nFigure 1: Satellite image of a geographic location\n\nGeographical data and high-resolution images from satellite imagery, aerial\nphotography, and public data sets from governmental agencies and commercial\nproviders are collected. These images are taken at different angles and times\nto create a composite view of the Earth's surface.\n\nImages from Street View Cars\n\nFigure 2: A live google street view car taking images from the streets using\nthe camera and sensors mounted on the top\n\nStreet View cars are equipped with cameras, LIDAR sensors, and GPS receivers\nto capture street-level imagery. They have a 360-degree camera on the top and\nliterally go around the streets taking images. This is what you see on your\nphone after you click the street view of a place.\n\nStitching the Images from These Sources\n\nTo create a seamless map, multiple images and data from all these sources are\nstitched together. Advanced algorithms are used to blend the images and data,\nconsidering their geographic coordinates and orientation.\n\nHow are features like rivers and parks identified?\n\nGoogle uses computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify and\nextract various map features from the imagery and data. This includes roads,\nbuildings, rivers, parks, and other geographic elements.\n\nHow does Google Maps generate a route?\n\nFigure 3: Converting the map into nodes and edges in an area to solve the\nshortest path problem and find a route\n\n  1. Google collects data from GPS devices and smartphones to create real-time traffic information and routing algorithms. This helps users find the best routes to their destinations, taking into account current traffic conditions. The more the number of devices detected on the same road using the GPS information, the map marks the portion of the road in red to denote traffic. This data is used by the machine learning model to predict the time it\u2019d take to reach the destination taking traffic into account.\n\n  2. This also helps google to suggest an alternate route as the algorithm penalizes routes that take more time for you to reach the destination. The algorithms used by Google Maps to generate a route from the start to the destination are a variation of Dijkstra and A* search. These are graph search algorithms that find the shortest path between two points. I programmed these algorithms for a robotics course in my grad school and here is a video that discusses one of the algorithms in detail, if you\u2019re interested.\n\nRendering all the information on your phone\n\nWhen a user accesses Google Maps, the system determines the portion of the map\nto display based on the user\u2019s view and zoom level. The corresponding map\ntiles are retrieved from the database and rendered on the user\u2019s screen.\n\nFeedback and manual correction\n\nGoogle continually updates its maps using new data and imagery from various\nsources. They also incorporate user feedback and corrections to improve the\naccuracy and completeness of the maps.\n\n## Question of the week\n\nHow do you think buildings and terrains are represented in 3D on your Google\nMaps? Reply to this email with your thoughts, and let\u2019s have a discussion.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\nHave a nice rest of the week, and take care! Until next Wednesday, Chendur\n\nSecond 30\n\nChendur Singaram\n\nPrevious\n\nPrevious\n\n## 2 gadgets explained in 2 mins!\n\nNext\n\nNext\n\n## How does Keycard Entry work?\n\n", "frontpage": false}
