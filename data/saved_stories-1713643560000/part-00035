It is completely inaccurate.\n\n\u201cIt started the day before the report came out when an influencer put up a\npicture of a list of papers that were apparently rejected for not being\nrandomised control trials.\n\nDawn Butler claimed in parliament that the review had failed to include 100\npapers, an assertion that Cass calls \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d\n\nJANE BARLOW/PA\n\n\u201cThat list has absolutely nothing to do with either our report or any of the\npapers.\n\n\u201cIf you deliberately try to undermine a report that has looked at the evidence\nof children\u2019s healthcare, then that\u2019s unforgivable. You are putting children\nat risk by doing that.\u201d\n\n## Advertisement\n\nIn the days after the Cass review was published, activists claimed on social\nmedia that only two out of 100 studies were included in the report.\n\nButler told the House of Commons: \u201cThere are around 100 studies that have not\nbeen included in this Cass report and we need to know why.\u201d\n\nCass explained that researchers had appraised every single paper, but pulled\nthe results from the ones that were high quality and medium quality, which was\n60 out of 103.\n\nOf Butler, she added: \u201cYou don\u2019t get up in parliament with an intent to spread\nmisinformation ... [but] what I was dismayed about, was the understanding she\ngot [from the report].\u201d\n\nCass\u2019s NHS review found that an entire field of medicine aimed at enabling\nchildren to change gender had been \u201cbuilt on shaky foundations\u201d. She found\nthere was no good evidence to support the global clinical practice of\nprescribing hormones to under-18s to pause puberty or transition to the\nopposite sex.\n\n## Advertisement\n\nThe Gender Identity Development Service (Gids) at the Tavistock and Portman\nNHS Foundation Trust was ordered to close after her interim report found it\n\u201cwas not a safe or viable long-term option\u201d.\n\nThe Gids clinic at the Tavistock Centre was ordered to close after Cass\u2019s\ninterim report was published\n\nHENRY NICHOLLS/THE AFP\n\nHer final report \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest review into the contested field of\ntransgender healthcare \u2014 involved trans patients, families, academics and\ndoctors.\n\nCass said she was pleased that, for the most part, both sides in the debate\nover the treatment of children with gender dysphoria had not \u201cweaponised\u201d her\nreport. But she has still had to deal with a \u201cpretty aggressive\u201d response from\nsome, particularly those in activist groups. She is also staying away from\nTwitter/X.\n\nCass said: \u201cThere are some pretty vile emails coming in at the moment. Most of\nwhich my team is protecting me from, so I\u2019m not getting to see them.\u201d Some of\nthem contained \u201cwords I wouldn\u2019t put in a newspaper\u201d, she said.\n\nShe added: \u201cWhat dismays me is just how childish the debate can become. If I\ndon\u2019t agree with somebody then I\u2019m called transphobic or a Terf [trans-\nexclusionary radical feminist].\u201d\n\n## Advertisement\n\nCass said the abuse spiked every time the review said something \u201cpeople don\u2019t\nlike\u201d.\n\nOnline discussion hardened following her interim report, in 2022, and the\nselection of Liz Truss as Tory Party leader and prime minister, she said.\n\u201cThat was when the debate got more aggressive and people got into bunkers,\nthen the online furore heats up.\u201d\n\nBut Cass, the former president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child\nHealth, is remaining resolute, despite being thrown into the middle of the\nculture wars.\n\nAsked if the abuse had taken a toll on her, she said: \u201cNo ... it\u2019s personal,\nbut these people don\u2019t know me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m much, much more upset and frustrated about all this disinformation than I\nam about the abuse. The thing that makes me seethe is the misinformation.\u201d\n\n## Advertisement\n\nShe added: \u201cI\u2019m not going on public transport at the moment, following\nsecurity advice, which is inconvenient.\u201d\n\nLast week it emerged that NHS adult gender clinics had finally agreed to share\nmissing data on the outcomes of 9,000 patients who were treated as children at\nthe Tavistock clinic.\n\n\u2022 \u2018Secretive\u2019 gender clinics back down over puberty blocker data\n\nCass revealed that six clinics had thwarted her review by refusing to co-\noperate with research into the long-term impact of prescribing puberty\nblockers and sex hormones. She described their failure to share data as \u201cco-\nordinated\u201d and \u201cideologically driven\u201d.\n\nShe told The Times that during her review she had held a \u201creally difficult\u201d\nmeeting with the clinics. They accused the review team of taking up their\n\u201cvaluable time\u201d, she claimed.\n\n\u201cThey were not particularly friendly to us when we approached\u201d, she added.\n\nCass also revealed that the Tavistock clinic had refused to co-operate with\nthe review by not handing over data on detransitioners who had been examined\nby a psychiatrist.\n\nThe review team wanted to assess what risk factors in a patient\u2019s history\ncould possibly be linked to detransition. A consultant who had carried out an\naudit of information from Gids patients had agreed to give it to the Cass\nteam.\n\nBut Cass said: \u201cWe asked the Tavistock to have it and they wouldn\u2019t give it to\nus. It was very disappointing.\u201d\n\nFollowing her report, Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister, told The Sunday\nTimes that there had been ideological capture of institutions, including the\nNHS, which needed to be corrected if Cass\u2019s recommendations were to be fully\ndelivered.\n\nCass responded yesterday by saying that there could plainly be ideological\ncapture about \u201calmost anything and certainly about this\u201d.\n\nIn regards to Tavistock, she told The Times she had concluded \u201cthere were\ncertainly one or two individuals ... who I would describe as activists among\nthe staff.\u201d\n\nHowever, she added: \u201cI think the majority of staff believed what they were\ndoing was right.\u201d\n\nWith long waiting lists for the treatment of children with gender dysphoria,\nseveral private clinics have recently emerged to fill the void. Cass said she\nwas concerned about that and claimed young people would not get the level of\nholistic care NHS clinics provided.\n\nDr Helen Webberley\u2019s firm GenderGP continues to offer puberty blocking\ninjections\n\nADRIAN SHERRATT FOR THE TIMES\n\nShe singled out GenderGP, a Singapore-based firm founded by Dr Helen\nWebberley, a British medic, which continues to advertise puberty blocking\ninjections.\n\n\u2022 Private doctors who give children puberty blockers may be struck off\n\nCass claimed the care offered by Webberley \u201ccertainly doesn\u2019t come anywhere\nnear anything one would recognise as adequate in terms of a proper assessment\nand exploration\u201d.\n\nShe is keeping a low profile following the publication of her report, but is\nadamant that she wants to help with the implementation of her review\u2019s 32\nrecommendations.\n\nMeanwhile, NHS England has announced a Cass-style review of adult gender\nclinics.\n\n\u201cYou heard it right here: I am not going to do the adult gender clinic\nreview,\u201d Cass said.\n\n### Related articles\n\nFIRST PERSON\n\nGrowing up I wanted to be a boy \u2014 I\u2019m glad puberty blockers were not an option\n\nApril 15 2024, 11.00pm BST\n\nAnonymous\n\nHEALTH\n\nAre autism and gender dysphoria linked?
