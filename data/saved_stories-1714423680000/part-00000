Ola was last on the\nshow in 2022, and he promised me he\u2019d come back when Mercedes was ready to\nlaunch an EV version of the G-Wagen \u2014 the company\u2019s legendary off-road\nvehicle.\n\nAnd it\u2019s here \u2014 the G580 with EQ technology is official, and it will start at\nover $150,000. Ola and I talked all about it, what it means for Mercedes\u2019\noverall electrification efforts, and whether the EQ branding is long for this\nworld.\n\nWe also talked about the EV market in general \u2014 a lot has changed since Ola\nwas on the show in 2022. Back then, he said Mercedes would have an all-EV\nlineup by 2030, which was a very trendy thing to say then. Like so many other\nautomakers, Mercedes has been walking that back a little lately, and I asked\nOla why \u2014 and what a more realistic timeline might look like. You\u2019ll hear Ola\ntalk about why he doesn\u2019t see the softening as a setback and why he and the\ncompany are still absolutely committed to phasing out gas in the long run.\n\nListen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge\u2019s Nilay Patel about big ideas \u2014\nand other problems. Subscribe here!\n\nOla and I also spent some time talking about what\u2019s happening inside cars\nlately, as more and more automakers try to build unique interfaces and\nexperiences instead of handing everything over to smartphone projection\nsystems like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Mercedes, in particular, has\nsomething called the Hyperscreen, a stunning display that stretches across the\nentire dashboard. It runs MBUX, which is Mercedes\u2019 custom operating system,\nand offers apps and games \u2014 even productivity software like Zoom. I asked Ola\nif he\u2019d ever use something like Apple\u2019s next-gen version of CarPlay, which\nwould take all of that over, and he flatly said no and explained why in some\ndetail.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more in this conversation, including unionization efforts in\nAlabama, how Ola sees AI playing out in cars, and the reveal of an upcoming\nelectric C-Class that Ola promised me I would love. Oh, and Nick Saban came up\na few times. It\u2019s a lot.\n\nYou\u2019re going to like this one. Okay, Ola K\u00e4llenius, CEO of Mercedes. Here we\ngo.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nOla K\u00e4llenius, you are the CEO of Mercedes-Benz! Welcome back to Decoder.\n\nGreat to be back on the show.\n\nI\u2019m very excited to talk to you again. You were last on the show in 2022. That\nwas a different time, I would say. Emotionally, economically in the car\nmarket, it felt very different, so we have a lot to talk about. A lot of\nthings have changed. Mercedes\u2019 approach to EVs has changed. There\u2019s quite a\nlot there, but I want to call out two things. You made two comments on the\nshow that I want to explicitly follow up on. First, you promised you would be\nback when the electric G-Wagen was ready, and it\u2019s here, and you are back.\nSecond, you told me at the end of that episode to reward myself and go buy a\nMercedes, and I did that. I bought one, but now I think it\u2019s time for me to\nbuy something new, and I want to talk about that as well.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the EV market in general. The last time you were here,\nMercedes \u2014 and every car company \u2014 was announcing plans to go all-electric.\nThe Mercedes target was \u201c2030, all-electric, no ICE vehicles in the lineup.\u201d\nBut in February of this year, you said 2030 is no longer a realistic milestone\nand that customers and market conditions will set the pace of the\ntransformation from ICE to all EVs. What happened there? What made you see\nthat \u201cokay, 2030 isn\u2019t going to hit \u2014 we are going to have to move this a\ncouple of years\u201d?\n\nLet\u2019s start to talk about the destination. Has the destination changed?\nAbsolutely not. We\u2019re on our way to a future, which is going to be zero\nemission. So, that quest is the same. And if I go one step back, when we, five\nyears ago, launched what we call Ambition 2039, we set an overriding goal for\nthe company. We want to future-proof our business, and we want to turn our\nbusiness into a CO2-neutral business by the end of the next decade. And that\nis in all dimensions \u2014 it\u2019s not just about the product lineup. It\u2019s, of\ncourse, about the supply chain. It\u2019s about our own operations. The product, of\ncourse, that\u2019s the obvious thing, but also the product in use. We are looking\nat this from A to Z \u2014 the whole value chain. So, if you\u2019re on this 20-year\nquest by the end of the next decade, get there. Then, you need to move in all\ndimensions.\n\nAnd now let me jump to the product, your specific question. And I said back\nthen, for the careful listener, we will be ready in 2030 to go all-electric\nwhere market conditions allow. That was the sentence I used back in 2022 \u2014\nactually, back in 2020. But when we talked in 2022, I know people exercise an\nelement of selective listening when you talk to people in all sorts of venues.\nSo, what stuck with people was, okay, in 2030, the product lineup is going to\nbe all-electric. But I put in, back then, \u201cwhere market conditions allow\u201d for\na reason \u2014 or for two reasons, really. It\u2019s a systemic shift. It\u2019s not just\nabout the product \u2014 we can control that. It is the charging infrastructure. It\nis the general switch over to non-fossil-based energy sources, et cetera. So,\nit\u2019s a much bigger systemic shift that we\u2019re talking about.\n\nIt is influenced by policy and incentivization in different markets around the\nworld, and the world is a heterogeneous place. So, I said that for a reason.\nNow, was that so I could say, \u201cOh, I changed my mind. We\u2019re not going to do\nit\u201d? No. And this is the next thing that is very, very important. We are\npreparing the whole Mercedes lineup from top to bottom \u2014 from the S-Class down\nto the entry levels like the CLA, the GLA, and those vehicles \u2014 in this\ndecade. By the end of this decade, before 2030, we will have a full lineup. If\nthere are markets that are ready to go for it \u2014 maybe it\u2019s Norway that will be\nthe first one to go all-electric \u2014 we shall see. But that investment \u2014 that\nputting our money where our mouth is and investing tens of billions into the\narchitectures, the underlying technology that I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll talk about \u2014 all\nof that is happening.\n\nBut we also have to recognize now that in terms of the market acceptance, the\nearly EV adoption phase is over. Now, we need mass adoption. Regarding the\nbuildup of charging infrastructure and all those enabling factors, if you had\nasked me three years ago, I would\u2019ve thought the gradient would be steeper at\nthis stage in the transformation. Although I\u2019m very much still convinced about\nthe destination as I mentioned, now you can see that the gradient is not as\nsteep. It\u2019s wholly possible that, in many major markets, they will not be\nthere by 2030. In such a situation, if you are an established manufacturer\nlike Mercedes-Benz with a loyal customer and fan base \u2014 and, again, thank you\nfor joining that, by the way \u2014 you cannot, in 2030, tell the customer that\nmaybe wants a high-tech electrified combustion product from us that \u201cthe shop\nis closed. We\u2019re not going to sell to you anymore.\u201d That would not be\neconomically sensible, and I\u2019m sure the customer wouldn\u2019t want that.\n\nWe have what I call tactical flexibility. And as I see it here today, in 2024,\nbased upon the data that I see, I think this is going to go into the \u201930s. How\nlong? Hard to say. A mini caveat there: humans have a tendency, when they look\nout the window and it\u2019s sunny, to think that tomorrow is going to be sunny and\nit\u2019s going to be sunny for the rest of the month or whatever. And if it\u2019s\nraining, you have that. Maybe the pendulum, in terms of the mood, swings to\nthe left and then to the right. We should not discard scenarios by which the\ntrajectory and the gradient of that EV adoption picks up pace during the\nsecond half of this decade.\n\nWe are preparing ourselves for an all-out launch of EV products, but if you go\ninto the Mercedes showroom, you will see that it is technologically on par,\nwith the new operating system and everything that\u2019s going on on the\ntechnological side, digital experience, autonomous driving, what have you.\nThat will be available in our combustion products as well. The customer\nexpects coherence from us. They walk into the showroom, and they get that.\n\nAnd last anecdote there: today, we have 350 American dealers here in Stuttgart\nlooking at the products of the future \u2014 a whole lineup. That\u2019s my next\nappointment. I\u2019m going to have dinner with them. I\u2019m a dinner speaker. So, we\nare now showing our dealer partners around the world what the product pipeline\nlooks like for the next couple or three years. Before going into this podcast\nhere, I called the guy and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the atmosphere in the room?\u201d And\nthey were like, \u201cThey are very excited. There were even standing ovations when\nsome of the products were rolled in.\u201d So, let\u2019s be \u2014 in terms of product and\ntechnology \u2014 positive about the transformation. The big winner of the\ntransformation is the customer. It\u2019s just getting better every day.\n\nThe Riesling is flowing at the dealer conference in Stuttgart. That\u2019s what I\u2019m\nhearing.\n\nOr maybe a beer. We\u2019re in Germany.\n\nYou mentioned early adopters. I want to key on that for one second. This is\nthe conventional wisdom, right? We were in the pandemic. There was a massive\nflood in the car market. Lots and lots of people bought cars. The prices of\nthe cars skyrocketed. It seemed like Tesla, in particular, had perfectly\nelastic demand. They just sold every single car they were going to make. That\nlooked like EV demand to a lot of people. It might\u2019ve confused a lot of\npeople. It might\u2019ve confused a lot of governments into accelerating their\ntransition plans. Is that your view of it: that was just overheated early\nadopter action, and now we\u2019re back to a regular car market?\n\nMaybe it\u2019s some of it, but I\u2019ve been in the auto industry for 31 years now,\nand I\u2019ve seen peaks and troughs and ups and downs and different economic\ncycles, but I\u2019ve never seen any business, including the auto business, be able\nto abolish gravity. There is a certain inertia and a certain speed to\neverything. Once you go from early adoption to mass adoption, one thing that\nthe consumer will never not want to have is complete freedom and individual\nmobility. If we look at this now as a system, there is a significant effort\nahead of us in building up charging infrastructure. In fact, since you and I\ntalked last, you probably have seen announcements for Mercedes both through\nconsortiums with other manufacturers but also standalone that we are now, over\nthe next five, six, or seven years, putting billions into charging\ninfrastructure.\n\nMercedes doesn\u2019t build gas stations today, nor do we have to. It\u2019s not our\nbusiness. We\u2019re a car company. But to avoid this chicken or egg situation that\nyou can get into when you want to take the step to mass adoption \u2014 but, even\nmore importantly, send a signal to Mercedes customers to say, \u201cWe got your\nback. We\u2019re investing for you. We want you to have convenience\u201d \u2014 we\u2019re\nactually trying to accelerate and enable. We are part of the systemic shift as\nwell, but early adoption is always chapter one in the book. Now, we\u2019re in\nchapter two. Chapter two is just a much longer chapter.\n\nLet me ask you a question about the charging infrastructure piece. The\ntransition to EVs is a lot of change, especially for a company like Mercedes,\nright? Historic strength in building internal combustion engines and all the\nthings you have to do. The last time you were here, we talked about moving\nthat strength into building EVs and all the different things you might have to\ndo. That\u2019s en route. Now you\u2019ve got to go build gas stations, right? You\u2019ve\ngot to build charging infrastructure. You have to sign deals with electric\ncompanies \u2014 all this other stuff that is a new set of capabilities. One, how\ndo you make sure that you\u2019re going to be good at that? And two, where does the\nmargin to fund all that build-out come from?\n\nThe auto industry was always about being a [decathlete]. It\u2019s not just a\n100-meter dash or the long jump or whatever. If you want to be successful in\nthe auto industry, you\u2019re a [decathlete], and the sum of all your skills needs\nto lead to the Olympic gold medal or whatever you\u2019re fighting to win. With the\ntransformation, we\u2019re adding two or three disciplines: the EV drivetrain,\neverything that\u2019s happening on the digital side, but also now some things that\nwere maybe not on the cards, where you go vertically into the energy\ndistribution as well. We have a competent team that works with enabling\nfactors for customers for a long, long time. It\u2019s the Mercedes-Benz mobility\nteam that has done everything from mobility services that does, of course, the\nfinancial insurance and all those services \u2014 so this whole know-how of how to\ncreate services around the vehicle to make the ownership experience better.\n\nWe have some foundation know-how there, but maybe we have not yet, in our\nprevious life, understood the complete landscape of the US electricity market.\nYou\u2019ve got to partner with people, and we have selected what we consider the\nbest partners in the business, and we\u2019re doing this in joint-owned new\nentities that we have built up. Then, we have a lot of especially young people\nin the company that just pick up on a task like that, and it seems like four\nweeks later, they\u2019ve read everything that you can possibly read on the topic,\nand they use their intelligence, their energy, and everything to step into it.\nSo, there, we\u2019re becoming a startup again. It\u2019s not 10 sports anymore; it\u2019s\n12, 13, 14 sports that you have to master.\n\nAs CEO, how are you keeping track of your mastery level?\n\nI think this goes for any position, but it also goes for the CEO: don\u2019t\nbelieve that you know everything. Life-long learning. Stay curious, read a\nlot, speak to people. Of course, use your experience, but you have to open\nyour mind. This technological shift is too big to rest on your old know-how.\nIt\u2019s not going to be enough.\n\nLet me ask in a more specific way: building charging infrastructure is very\nhard, very capital-intensive, and physically intensive. You have to put\nchargers in the right place at the right time for people who are making long\njourneys. You\u2019ve partnered with Tesla, right? You\u2019re going to use the NACS\n[North American Charging Standard] connector. You\u2019re going to be part of the\nsupercharger network. You\u2019re building your own network next to it. How do you\nknow if you\u2019re winning in this game?\n\nIn consortium or piggybacking off of what others already have built up \u2014 a\ntactical decision to improve the customer experience \u2014 it\u2019s all about the\ncustomer here. But if we go deeper into charging, what do you need to know?\nLocation, of course. Location, location, location. You need to know the\ndriving patterns of where your customers drive and what is relevant to them.\nThrough our connected data fleet, we have all of that \u2014 anonymized, of course\n\u2014 so we know the routes where we need to be. You then need to team up with\npartners that know people in real estate or other companies that have real\nestate in the right locations. You\u2019ve got to look at how many actual charging\npoints per charging location make sense. What\u2019s the density in terms of\ncharging speed? And all the Mercedes are going to be high-power charging and\nthe next-gen EV vehicles with 800-volt systems and everything are going to be\neven more high-power charging. Of course, go for high-power charging so that\nyou can charge the vehicle very quickly.\n\nYou look at utilization. What is the minimum utilization? You mentioned\ncapital. What\u2019s the minimal utilization you need to make money? It needs to be\na business in its own right. For sure, you have an investing phase, and you\nplant your vines, and maybe your first good wine from the vines is five or six\nyears later, and then the asset starts paying off. Of course, the spreadsheet\nis involved as well. What does this look like financially? In our view, it\u2019s\nnot \u201cwinner-takes-all, there can only be one charging company, and it\u2019s the\nonly one that can make money.\u201d No. But you need to have a minimal critical\nmass for it to make money and also carry the fixed cost. So, we have done some\ncareful calculations on that, and now we\u2019re on our way.\n\nThe first stations are now up in the US, up in Europe, up in China. We\u2019re\nlooking at Korea. We\u2019re looking at Japan. We\u2019re looking at other places. We\npartnered with our dealers in India and very quickly put up a range of\ncharging options in India along the main driving routes, so things are moving\nhere.\n\nDo you think we\u2019re going to get to a place where there\u2019s a Tesla charging\nstation, a Mercedes charging station, and a Rivian charging station all on the\ncorner of an intersection like we have gas stations today, and they\u2019ll just\nadvertise their rates, and it will be that kind of business?\n\nNot impossible. There\u2019s still a lot of free land out there for this. We have\nnot claimed every little piece of land where you can dig for gold here. A lot\nof it is open.\n\nI asked that question because if that\u2019s the end state, that market operates on\nrelatively razor-thin margins. It\u2019s the gas market, and the prices fluctuate,\nand everyone\u2019s always aware of it. You literally see gas stations next to each\nother trying to beat each other by 10 cents. If you end up in that situation,\nwill all of this forward investment have been worth it?\n\nIf we get into a place, 10 years from now, where the market starts\nconsolidating, well, maybe the market consolidates. We shall see. I don\u2019t\nknow. Our primary goal would be number one: customer experience. Take care of\nthe customer. Make sure that our customer has what they expect from Mercedes.\nNumber two: to make money. And we will then weigh our options and see what the\nbest route forward is.\n\nI think it\u2019s a good place to ask some pretty classic Decoder questions. The\nlast time you were on the show, we talked about the structure of Mercedes,\nwhich, at the time, was going through being streamlined into Mercedes-Benz\nGroup after the spinoff of Daimler Truck. It\u2019s been a few years. How has that\ngone? Are you more focused? Is that structure still the same, or are there\nmore changes?\n\nI think we\u2019re more focused. We had a hypothesis, even though Daimler had been\ntogether for more than a hundred years with cars and vans on the one side and\ntrucks and buses on the other side. If you now look back at the spinoff from a\nfinancial point of view, where you unlock the conglomerate discount and create\nvalue for your shareholders, the spinoff was just that \u2014 we gave shareholders\nshares in two companies instead of one company. Now, a couple or three years\nlater, did that happen? Absolutely, it did. So, the financial hypothesis so\nfar \u2014 and I know you\u2019ve got to win every football game one at a time, I\nrealized that \u2014 that worked out really, really well for shareholders, and the\nfeedback that we have received from our shareholders was \u201cthat was absolutely\nthe right strategic move.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to the focus, when you\u2019re not in big management meetings and\ntalking about everything and then half of the audience is listening or half of\nthe other half is listening to the other, do you get more focused? Absolutely,\nyou do. I\u2019m sure that goes for the truck guys. You have to ask them, but\nthey\u2019re in the spotlight of the financial market. They\u2019re publicly listed on\nthe Frankfurt Stock Exchange, but it\u2019s all about trucks and buses for them.\nIt\u2019s all about luxury cars and premium vans for us. We have streamlined the\norganization and really tried to do a very, very simple thing: build the\nworld\u2019s most desirable cars, make our customers happy, and also make a little\nbit of money out of that.\n\nIt\u2019s funny that you run Mercedes, and I run a team of 70, and I think I have\nmeetings where only half of the people are listening. The problems are the\nsame no matter how big you are. Have you changed anything about how [Mercedes-\nBenz] Group is structured after the spinoff? Since you\u2019ve been able to focus,\nthere have to be some benefits you\u2019ve seen that have led you to structural\nchanges on your own.\n\nYes. Whether the spinoff in its own right was the only catalyst for that or\nthe transformation in general, I think maybe it\u2019s a mix of everything there.\nAn organization is not a static thing that just sits there and nothing ever\nhappens. I think we are constantly evolving, but much of our structure is\ncentered in and around the product, and I guess that\u2019s how a car company is\nrun. You have the functions, R&D, production, marketing and sales and so on,\nand the other functions around that, but it\u2019s so much centered around the\nproduct. And there, from time to time, we also make organizational changes,\nbut only if they make sense. Does it make us faster? Do we get to the right\nanswer in a better way? Those types of things. Where it\u2019s constant change at\nthe moment is on the process side, especially through digitalization. And now,\nwith GenAI entering the stage \u2014 yet another tool in the toolbox \u2014 we\u2019re in the\nsandbox, and they throw us another thing that we can play with.\n\nOn the process side, I would say there is even more change to make things\nfaster, more productive, higher quality. The simulation tools just get better\nand better and better. Based upon 75 years of research in safety, one of the\nhallmarks of Mercedes, where the trailblazers in the auto industry have\nsafety, we have so much data now that our simulation models for simulated\ncrashes are so good in terms of the correlation to what happens in the real\nworld. We still crash a lot of vehicles, but the simulation data is so good\nthat we literally can simulate hundreds of variants of those crashes without\neven building a car. But you\u2019ve got to get it right. There is a revolution\ngoing on in how we do the business, not just on the product side.\n\nWhat do you think the biggest change you\u2019ve made has been in the past two\nyears?\n\nThe biggest change has been around digitalization \u2014 rearranging our processes\nin and around the digital tools that steadily become available.\n\nGive me an example.\n\nIn production, we have been working on the virtual factory for, I don\u2019t know,\n25 years, but the latest extension is our Hungarian plant where we will build\nthe next-gen EV like the CLA, for instance, that we showed at the Munich Auto\nShow in September. The digital tools that are available now [allow us] to make\na complete digital replica of the plant before you even pour one bucket of\nconcrete and move that into a 3D [model], down to the last station in\nassembly, and look, from all angles, at the assembly moves and everything.\nIt\u2019s like you can build the whole factory and go through a whole series of\niterations of that, and that would\u2019ve led to physical changes. It\u2019s scary\ngood. Your ability to then, once you go into the hardware, have a first-time-\nright ratio there is much higher. Saves cost, saves time.\n\nWe had Matthew Ball on the show a while back. He wrote a book called The\nMetaverse. This was a big part of his pitch about the Metaverse: You would\nhave digital twins of real-world factories and other facilities. You\u2019d be able\nto put people in virtual environments that would lead to a result where you\nare right the first time when you actually build the physical environment, and\nyou can obviously iterate virtually before you iterate physically and bring\ndown the factory production time and all that stuff. That\u2019s a big bet, right?\nThat\u2019s the pitch, but you have to go get it right and do it, and it has to\nwork. Between that pitch and investment in those kinds of technologies, the\ninvestments in charging, these are huge decisions that fall on you \u2014 to invest\nin these things and bet the company on them. How do you make decisions? Has\nthat changed as more and more digital technologies enter the fray and more and\nmore capital investments seem like the numbers are going up?\n\nOf course, on any one business decision, you make assumptions. You put the\nfinances on a piece of paper. You calculate it, but not everything can have\n100 percent predictability. It\u2019s just not how it works, especially on the\ndigital side. In some cases, you just have to have belief. You see a digital\nproduct coming, and you go, \u201cWow, this is a great idea.\u201d I 100 percent agree\nwith what you just said. The digital twin is not just a factory. We have a\ndigital twin of the product as well, and we use that term \u2014 digital twin. You\njust look at that and go, \u201cThat is intuitively right.\u201d No matter what the\nspreadsheet says. Don\u2019t spend too much money on calculating how many hours you\nsave and what\u2019s the cost in dollars per hour and so on. Maybe you can do that\nto comfort yourself that you\u2019re making the right investment decision, but you\nhave to marry that to \u201cthis looks right \u2014 let\u2019s go, let\u2019s do this now, and\ngive it to the engineers and let them play with the toy and just unlock the\npotential of it.\u201d\n\nYou do a mix of those two things, but you\u2019re right; the level of investment is\nhigh. In the auto industry and our company, we have never invested on a higher\nlevel than we\u2019re doing now \u2014 mostly in product, of course, but also into\nenabling technologies like the ones that we just talked about.\n\nI want to ask about one big decision, and I really just want to talk about the\nG-Wagen. Let\u2019s be honest: this is all me eating the vegetables before I get to\ntalk with the G-Wagen.\n\nThe auto industry is in a time of massive investment, changes to\nmanufacturing, and bringing down costs by using digital technologies,\npotentially with AI. Your workers in Germany and across Europe are widely\nunionized. There\u2019s a union campaign in Alabama right now at your factory\nthere. There\u2019s controversy around it. Are you going to let that go through?\nThe issue that unions have in America and that the UAW has is that the\ntransition to EV manufacturing will reduce jobs or reduce pay in some way.\n\nAlabama is dear to my heart. I worked in that plant twice in my career. In\nfact, I kind of started my career in the trainee program there. I founded my\nfamily in Alabama. Two of my kids were born there. I feel like an Alabamian.\nI\u2019m a Crimson Tide fan, for the football fans out there. Maybe some of you\nknow that Nick Saban \u2014 the GOAT as far as college football coaches is\nconcerned \u2014 is a Mercedes dealer. He\u2019s here this week. I\u2019m having dinner with\nhim tomorrow because he\u2019s part of that \u2014 looking at the products that I\nmentioned.\n\nI just want to be clear: you\u2019ve now revealed that Nick Saban gets his own\ndinner.\n\nI consider him a friend, and I was there when he won his first championship\nwith Alabama. Obviously, I\u2019d won a championship with LSU. I\u2019m emotionally\ncommitted to the United States. I\u2019m emotionally committed to Alabama and to\nthat plant. We have a fantastic team there. It\u2019s second to none. The passion\nthat they have to build the greatest cars, the atmosphere, people going the\nextra mile, that \u201cone team\u201d culture \u2014 all of that is unique. Ultimately, it\nwill be the team members who decide what they want to do going forward. And\nthere you have it.\n\nIt\u2019s great that you love Alabama. It\u2019s great that you love Nick Saban. The\nunion there is saying Mercedes is union-busting. They want to decide. They\u2019ve\nasked for an election. Do you want this process to be as contentious as it\nseems like it might be?\n\nWhen unionization campaigns happen around the world, of course there will\nalways be some emotions around that. I think that is inevitable, but it comes\nback to one simple fact: the team members have their future in their hands,\nand they make that choice. So, that\u2019s it.\n\nOkay, got it. We\u2019ll see what happens there. We\u2019re definitely tracking it\nbecause it\u2019s very interesting. The Big Three \u2014 [General Motors, Stellantis,\nand Ford] \u2014 have sort of embraced their unions, but outside of that, not so\nmuch. And that movement is starting to grow with EVs. It seems like the auto\nunion movement is going to happen in parallel with the EV transition, at least\nin the United States. And I think it seems like that is yet another thing to\nmanage as part of the transition \u2014 if you want to be all-EVs by the mid-2030s,\nthe labor issue is one you\u2019re going to have to solve.\n\nWell, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the dynamic behind this particular situation. We\noperate in about 150 countries around the world. We don\u2019t have production\noperations in that many countries, but we have production operations in many\ncountries. We\u2019re, of course, in Germany, our home, and in several other\ncountries in Europe. We\u2019re in the United States. We are in China. We are in\nMexico. We\u2019re in South Africa. We are in Thailand. We\u2019re in India. We\u2019re\nalmost everywhere. Each country has its own systems in terms of labor\nrepresentation. As you know, we have labor representation here in Germany.\nIt\u2019s part of the tradition, and we work well with them. And we have some\ncountries where there is no labor participation in an organized way. As you go\naround the world, you have different [systems], but one thing that is never\ndifferent if you go around the world: there\u2019s always one Mercedes culture.\nThere\u2019s one Mercedes standard.\n\nIf you go into that plant in Alabama, if you go into a plant here outside\nStuttgart, if you go into one in... I was in Beijing this week, and if you go\ninto that plant or in India or anywhere, you see the same thing. You see the\nsame standard. You see the same technology. You see the same precision. You\nsee the same passion and dedication to quality. You see the same way we work.\nYou see how we have a people culture. That\u2019s the one Mercedes team. That never\nchanges.\n\nAlright, where\u2019s the G-Wagen being built? You mentioned all those places.\n\nIn Graz, Austria. Graz, Austria was the place that was selected in a joint\nventure, which was called [Steyr-Daimler-Puch] at the time and, today, is\nMagna, part of the very large Canadian automotive supplier industrial group.\nSince 1979, the home of the G has been Graz, Austria, in Styria, a beautiful\npart of the country. We have an additional benefit of being exactly there.\n\nThey have a mountain next to the plant. This mountain is called the Sch\u00f6ckl.\nIt\u2019s [been] privately owned [for] decades, [maybe] centuries. That is one of\nthe roughest off-road tracks in the world, and we have, from the owner, a\nspecial permit to test our vehicles on the Sch\u00f6ckl. If you look carefully in\nthe door seal of a G, you\u2019ll see a little plaque which says \u201cSch\u00f6ckl tested.\u201d\nYou\u2019re only a real G if you\u2019ve done that. Since I work at the company, I have\nbecome a member of the exclusive club, and I have my own plaque.\n\nI have earned the plaque of \u201cSch\u00f6ckl proofed,\u201d and I\u2019ve got to tell you this\nstory. Many years ago, I got this. They put you in a G, and you are supposed\nto negotiate the whole mountain and get to the top. Okay, fair enough. I\u2019ve\ndone a reasonable amount of off-road driving in my days. And when I was up for\n\u201cthe test,\u201d I started going. I hit, in the middle of the mountain, a very\nsharp rock back then, so a tire blew, and those are sturdy tires. So my\nparticular experience included a switch of tire. The engineers helped me \u2014 I\nhave to give them credit for that. And I came up to the top with slightly\nsweaty palms, proud of myself. I\u2019m sure that the professional drivers were\ngiggling behind my back, but anyway, I made it to the top.\n\nAt the top, there is a hut. There, you drink a typical Austrian Schnapp, which\nis called Zirbenschnaps. If you try it, it doesn\u2019t taste that good, but you\ndon\u2019t think about that when you\u2019re at the top. You think you\u2019ve earned the\nplaque \u2014 you haven\u2019t. Now comes the most exciting part: you need to go down\nwith a professional driver, and you take one of those guys that have done that\nfor, I don\u2019t know, 20, 25 years. The only difference is he takes you down that\nmountain sometimes at 40, 50 miles an hour. You need to have a lot of belief.\n\nOr a lot of Schnapps.\n\nThose are narrow roads. There are a lot of rocks. There are a lot of trees.\nIt\u2019s steep. You get to the bottom. Needless to say, I survived; otherwise, we\nwouldn\u2019t have this conversation. I\u2019ve earned my plaque. So, not only has Steyr\nor Graz, the city, been a good place for us to do this \u2014 we have the perfect\nconditions for that unique, adventurous product.\n\nSo, it\u2019s an electric G-Wagen. It\u2019s a G-580. You\u2019ve been showing it off in\ncamouflage forever. At CES, I saw three or four of them do the circle turn all\nin a row together. It was very entertaining. I want to call something out\nhere. It is not the EQG, which is how you\u2019ve named all the other EV models you\nhave. It is the G-580 with EQ technology, and it seems like, at some point, EQ\nas a brand has to fade away. Is this the first step of that fading away?\n\nIn a certain phase of going toward electric, you over index on \u201cthis is\nelectric.\u201d But in the end, every Mercedes is a Mercedes. The EQS is a\nMercedes. The S-Class is a Mercedes. I drive the EQS SUV. That\u2019s my company\ncar; I love it to death \u2014 best car I\u2019ve ever driven. But we will, over time,\nin terms of nomenclature, make sure that we then, at the end, don\u2019t confuse\nthe customer, that zipper comes together. So, it\u2019s the G-Class, and it is\nelectric, hence why, on the fender, it says \u201cEQ technology.\u201d In the fall, I\ngot to drive a prototype of that electric G up and down the Sch\u00f6ckl mountain.\nNo less than five times, we had a press event. There\u2019s one thing that can\nnever be a surprise and that you have to stick to: a G needs to look like a G.\nNever mess with the styling. The G remains the G.\n\nIt needs to have phenomenal class-leading off-road capabilities, and of\ncourse, I\u2019ve driven the mountain with the incredible combustion-based products\nand with all the differentials and everything you have. The electric G is so\nprecise. The software feels the surface and can, with millimeter precision,\nadjust every single tire and put the exact right torque and everything to it.\nIt was unbelievably easy to get up the mountain, and I need to probably send\nyou some pictures of some of the situations that I was in. I was joking [with]\nthe engineers as I came up, [saying,] \u201cMy mother could do this.\u201d With that\nstatement, I\u2019m not saying that my mother is not a good driver. In fact, she\u2019s\na better driver than I am and probably has a 60-year record of no accidents\nand stuff like that. But maybe her daily drive is not a hardcore off-roading,\nbut it is so easy. Anybody can more or less negotiate that vehicle with the\nelectric G. So, I think the tailor-made electric drivetrain that we have made\nfor that car kind of opens up a new dimension of off-roading.\n\nFirst of all, I feel like some hardcore off-road fans are going to have a lot\nof feelings about EVs making it so easy that anybody can do it, especially on\ntrails that hard. That\u2019s one thing \u2014 we should set that aside. That could be a\nwhole hour of just people feeling that way.\n\nBut there\u2019s something else here that I think is interesting that you said: \u201cIt\nhas to look like a G.\u201d This is an iconic car design, and you\u2019ve added an\nelectric drivetrain to it. You can go buy essentially the same design with a\ngas drivetrain in it and have a different experience. That has not been a\nMercedes approach. The S-Class and EQS look radically different from each\nother. Inside, they are very similar, but outside, they look very different.\nThey have different brand names.\n\nI have a C-450 AMG. I would love to get a C-Class EV. You don\u2019t make one yet \u2014\nyou might \u2014 but I would like it to look like the current C-Class, not whatever\ndesign language is happening on the EQ side. Is this something that you\u2019re\nthinking about changing as well? Because the G-Wagen is the first one where\nyou see that it\u2019s the same essential design with different drivetrains.\n\nTake the EQS sedan, for instance \u2014 the most slippery car in the world. Here,\nyou have this huge luxury limousine \u2014 five, 20 meters long or whatever \u2014 with\nall the Mercedes bells and whistles, including the insane Hyperscreen and all\nthat stuff. And yes, for that car, the sibling car to the traditional S-Class,\nform follows function. We built a machine that we just now updated coming in\nthis summer with a drag coefficient of O.2. And now in WLTP certification\nvalues up to 828 kilometers [514 miles] of range. It\u2019s phenomenal for a\nvehicle like that. We have the highest customer satisfaction ratings of any\ncar on that one. You can\u2019t do that to the G. The G is the G, and the shape is\nwhat it is, and that is one of the main buying criteria.\n\nAre the EVs going to stay more different design-wise?\n\nI\u2019m not going to reveal everything, but if you\u2019re in that C-Class segment \u2014\none of the cars that we are showing the people here today, by the way, so in a\nnot-too-distant future \u2014 I guarantee that you will love the styling. If that\u2019s\nnot the case, money back for you. I\u2019m putting that bet out there. Once you see\nthat car, we\u2019re going to do another Verge podcast in 2026 when it\u2019s out, and\nthen we\u2019ll see if I over-promised.\n\nAlright, I\u2019ve got to see if Nick Saban is going to leak me this car, first of\nall. Second of all, that\u2019s really interesting \u2014 the idea that you\u2019re going to\nconverge the standard design and the EV design or that you will guarantee that\npeople love it. The classic Mercedes design, people just love it. The EQ\ndesign has been more polarizing, so that guarantee feels like you\u2019re going to\nhead in more of a direction that, let\u2019s say, BMW is in, where the i4 is\nbasically a 4 Series with an EV drivetrain and the i7 is basically a 7 Series\nwith an EV drivetrain. Is that what the market is telling you? That,\nstrategically, we should make more of the same car with different drivetrains?\n\nWe\u2019re heading in a direction that will be 100 percent Mercedes and 100 percent\nrecognizable as a Mercedes. Pick up on styling cues that are uniquely Mercedes\nand can only be Mercedes and will be beautiful. So, I stand by my promise.\n\nAlright, we\u2019ll have you back. Every time you have a new car out, we\u2019ll have\nyou back, and we\u2019ll just pick up the conversation.\n\nCan I say one thing [about] the G? Because I think this is important. So, the\nstyling is the same \u2014 don\u2019t mess with the styling [is] rule number one with\nthe G \u2014 but you mentioned the Mercedes engineers. They have ants in their\npants. They never stand still. They always push forward. They always look for\nwhat\u2019s next on technology. We have made a whole host of subtle changes that\nonly the trained eye will see but that makes a world of difference. I\u2019m going\nto take one example and as we\u2019re now launching this electric G, we are also\nupdating the complete combustion offering of the G as well. So the whole G\nlineup is being freshened here alongside the electric G. If you take the\nA-pillar, the way you put two pieces of metal together back in 1979, the\nflange was kind of on the outside of the body, not on the inside, and you\ncover that with a nice-looking cover \u2014 this black strip that every G driver\nimmediately recognizes \u2014 but that creates drag.\n\nOn a combustion-based product, that may not be that big of a deal, but on an\nelectric car, you are chasing every single arrow point. It\u2019s like you\u2019re in\nFormula One: they\u2019re looking for downforce, and here, the guys in the wind\ntunnel are looking for drag reduction while keeping it beautiful. So, we turn\nthat inside. We still put a nice-looking cover on top of it. You don\u2019t really\nsee it, but it significantly reduced the drag \u2014 just that simple change to the\nbody construction. While we were at it, we did that for the ICE-based cars as\nwell. You get them better range \u2014 that\u2019s the thing. Of course, you chase\nrange. You want to keep the battery. Every kilowatt-hour, every watt, is\nprecious in an electric car. So, every user of wattage you optimize and\npushing an object through air eats up energy, obviously. Remember your physics\nclass in school.\n\nBut what\u2019s the benefit on the combustion side? Of course, that reduces the\nconsumption on that one as well, but it\u2019s not as crucial, but it reduces the\nwind noise. Now, you don\u2019t live in Germany, but if you [did], we still have\nfree speeds on the Autobahn. Maybe an AMG GT is the right car to open it up\nand see what it can do, and the G is a little bit less so. But if you [were]\ndriving a G, let\u2019s say, at 160 or 170 kilometers an hour [99\u2013105 miles per\nhour], the wind noise, in spite of the boxy shape, is so much less now for one\nof those subtle changes that you can easily have a conversation on the phone\nhands-free or with the person sitting next to you, what have you.\n\nWe have made dozens and dozens of dozens of small changes to the G that make\nthe product overall better, and we have completely updated the infotainment to\nthe latest and greatest \u2014 maybe not the number one buying criteria for the G,\nbut a lot of people buy the car. It\u2019s a lifestyle choice. You live in downtown\nLA, you go back and forth to work with it, and you just love it because you\nlove it. And you want to have the latest navigation. You want to have the best\nentertainment. You want to have all of those things and all the convenience.\nAll of that comes with the electric G, but also with the combustion-based Gs.\n\nI feel like in downtown LA, most G-wagons are off-roading by going over the\ncurb at Starbucks, and that might be it. Let me ask about the infotainment.\nThis is a big deal in the industry. It feels like a central tension of the\nentire industry.\n\nYou have the Hyperscreen. For people who don\u2019t know what the Hyperscreen is:\npause the podcast and go look at a picture of the Mercedes Hyperscreen. It is\nvery compelling. It\u2019s a huge screen across the front dash of the car. Even for\nyour models that don\u2019t have a Hyperscreen, you still have big screens\neverywhere. You have MBUX, which is your infotainment platform. You just added\nChatGPT to it, which is fascinating. You are all in on AI \u2014 you\u2019ve mentioned\nthat several times now. There\u2019s another view of the world, which says, \u201cJust\ngive all of this to Apple,\u201d right? Apple CarPlay is what people want to buy.\n\nGM drops CarPlay \u2014 there\u2019s a huge outcry. We\u2019ll see how that plays out for\nthem. Apple is very confident that people are going to buy cars with Apple\nCarPlay. You still have CarPlay in there. In 2022, Apple announced a version\nof CarPlay that can take over something like the Hyperscreen and take over the\ninstrument cluster in front of the driver. I asked you then, \u201cWould you ever\ndo that?\u201d You said, \u201cI\u2019ve got to talk to them.\u201d It\u2019s been a couple of years.\nHave you talked to them? Would you ever let them take over all of the\ninfotainment of the car in that way?\n\nThe short answer is no, but you need to look at it from a bigger perspective.\nEverything that\u2019s going on in this digital window into your car and to the\nworld is not just infotainment. It\u2019s not just the music that you listen to or\nthe phone call that you make. Where there is another revolution going on is\nassisted and automated driving. Our so-called Mercedes-Benz operating system\nis really the central nervous system in the brain of the whole car, of which\nthe infotainment is one of four domains. The whole operating system \u2014\ninfotainment, automated driving, every single function of the body, exterior\nand interior of the car, the whole drive system, the battery management, the\ntelecommunications module speaking to the cloud where we have the personal\ndelay file for you with your settings and everything \u2014 is all one holistic\nsoftware architecture.\n\nIf you want to create a superior customer experience, you need to think about\nthat as a whole, and only the manufacturer can tie all of it together. Nobody\nout there \u2014 none of the tech companies \u2014 is even aspiring to do that whole\nthing. If you want that to be perfect, integrated, and seamless, you don\u2019t\nwant to jump between different worlds \u2014 \u201cOh, I\u2019m now in the infotainment.\nWell, let\u2019s jump back to Mercedes,\u201d and so on and so forth. So, our quest is a\ndifferent one. We want to create the best digital experience in the world for\nyou. That includes fantastic and intuitive UI. And you will also see when we\nlaunch MBOS 1.0 next year in the CLA. But the precursor to that is MBOS 0.5,\nwhich we actually already launched in the new E-Class, where we have\nprogrammed the complete infotainment domain ourselves. It\u2019s probably the\nbiggest digital in-house product that we have ever made.\n\nWe work with the best. Yes, we\u2019re integrating Google Maps. In fact, we are\ndeveloping with Google the next generation of what a map in a car married to\nthe driving-assistant system should look like. [It\u2019s a] fascinating product\nwhere the best of the Google engineers and the best of the Mercedes engineers\ncan throw their expertise together and take that to the next level. I\nfundamentally believe that holistic customer experience is best done by us,\nand we will serve you. Then, there are, of course, other aspects to that. If\nyou get a Mercedes product, I assume you have a Mercedes me ID, you have the\napp, you have everything. You can take that ID with you to several cars.\n\nMy wife and I actually have our profiles in both our cars. When I step into my\nwife\u2019s car, the car recognizes me, and it puts the seat in the right position.\nIt turns down the air conditioning a little bit. She likes it a little bit\nwarmer. I like it a little bit colder. It puts on my favorite music station,\nwhatever it is. My tailor-made suit \u2014 my digital tailor-made suit and physical\nsuit \u2014 adapts to me. All of it is integrated. Your personal profile with your\nprivacy (you choose your privacy \u2014 it\u2019s another very important thing for\nMercedes) is in the cloud and is available. You don\u2019t want to rip one limb of\nthat body out and give it to somebody else. I fundamentally don\u2019t think that\u2019s\nthe right thing to do.\n\nAnd, of course, we want to keep the customer interface with you. There are so\nmany reasons why we\u2019re doing what we\u2019re doing, but we\u2019re not fundamentalists\nto say, for some reason, we\u2019re not going to allow a customer to use Apple\nCarPlay if that\u2019s what they choose to do. We have Apple CarPlay. We have\nAndroid Auto. If, for some of the functions, you feel more comfortable with\nthat and will switch back and forth, be my guest. You can get that, too. But\nto give up the whole cockpit head unit \u2014 in our case, a passenger screen and\neverything to somebody else \u2014 the answer is no. You\u2019re stepping into your\nMercedes cocoon, your Mercedes rolling living room, and the furniture and the\ndigital stuff are from Mercedes. Welcome to Mercedes. That\u2019s it.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of concepts in there. This should have been the first question\nbecause I\u2019ve got a whole hour of questions just to follow up on all that.\nLet\u2019s start with mapping, which, to me, feels like once mapping plus autonomy\ncome together, a lot of the car market will change around it. So, you get in\nthe car, you tell Google Maps, \u201cI want to go here,\u201d and the car drives itself\nthere on whatever timeline. That could be five years from now. I don\u2019t think\nit\u2019s tomorrow, but on some timeline, this is where the industry is headed. At\nthat point, the user interface in front of you \u2014 the screens, the infotainment\n\u2014 becomes what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re in competition with the phone because\npeople will just pull out their phones and play on their phones or the car\ngoes wherever it goes.\n\nTo make this happen \u2014 to even get to the place where you\u2019re in competition\nwith a phone like that \u2014 you need a mapping system. You need people to use the\ninbuilt mapping system of the car. And right now, people use CarPlay for\nmessages, podcasting, music, and mapping, so you\u2019ve got to compete with the\nmapping. Is that why you\u2019re working with Google? To get people out of using\nCarPlay for mapping?\n\nI think, in terms of customer experience and use cases, obviously, if you\u2019re\nin a car, you\u2019re probably going somewhere, right?\n\nOh, by the way, I\u2019ll add for EVs, you need to map your charging and pre-\ncondition the car for charging.\n\nThat\u2019s a given. We have that today. Most of the things that I\u2019m talking about,\nwe have today, but we\u2019re taking it to the next level. So, if you\u2019re in a car,\nyou\u2019re probably going somewhere, even though that\u2019s maybe another chapter of\nthe podcast. A lot of customers in China and in Asia actually spend time in\nthe car just to spend time in the car, and I\u2019m going to get back to that in a\nsecond. \u201cMe time\u201d in the car is kind of the new thing. So, we are going to\ncreate downright the best \u201cfrom A to B\u201d digital experience that you can think\nof. And it\u2019s obvious \u2014 you said it yourself. If you integrate that with other\nfunctions in the car, driving assistant \u2014 can\u2019t reveal too much here. It\u2019s\nalmost like I\u2019m having my presentation on the next-generation vehicle here.\nIt\u2019ll be too soon, but we do speak about this.\n\nSo, yeah, stay tuned. It\u2019s great. Now, it\u2019s about to get even better. But\nhere\u2019s another thing: I love my smartphone. You mentioned Apple. I have Apple.\nI have a MacBook and everything. I think Tim Cook and Steve Jobs before him\nhave done a fantastic job over the last many decades. So, I\u2019m an Apple fan\nthrough and through. I watch movies on my iPhone on a train or when I\u2019m\nwaiting at an airport or whatever I\u2019m doing. But when I get home and I want to\nwatch a movie, I watch it on my fantastic TV \u2014 a much bigger screen \u2014 laying\non my sofa. Now, look at your car, especially when you\u2019re in autonomous mode.\nWe have the first level three baby steps in the market already, and the next\nstep is to raise the speed of level three.\n\nI test-drove a prototype here in Germany to raise the speed from 60 kilometers\nan hour to 95 kilometers an hour. Wow, then it starts getting interesting,\nright? It\u2019s like you can put yourself in the right lane and be in a train. If\nI then want to watch a movie, what do I pick? My fantastic, blow-your-mind,\nvery big Hyperscreen in the car like in my living room at home, or do you pick\nup my phone and watch that small screen? For me, that decision is an absolute\nno-brainer. If I want to have a video conference, maybe I don\u2019t want to watch\na movie \u2014 I want to have a video conference. I want to be able to see the\nPowerPoint presentation and see the person that I\u2019m talking to. I could go on\nand on and on and on and on.\n\nThere are so many reasons why you would do this. If you look carefully at the\nconcept car of that CLA that we showed in Munich, look at what the passenger\nis going to get. We were the first ones with the new E-Class that I mentioned\nbefore that now got certification in Europe that the passenger can watch a\nmovie while you\u2019re driving. You\u2019re not allowed to have driver distraction and\nall that, but if the driver directs its view to the screen and starts watching\nthe movie, it turns black. So, you have eye tracking for stuff like that.\nThere is an explosion of use cases going on here, and the real estate in the\ncar is that your 55-inch TV \u2014 it\u2019s not quite that \u2014 but it\u2019s going to be, in\nMercedes, a very attractive offering to take care of a lot of those use cases.\n\nSo, the bet here \u2014 and I\u2019ve heard this from a lot of car manufacturers, I\nheard this from you the last time we spoke \u2014 is that people will be drawn to\nthe biggest screen they can get and that the computing environment of the big\nscreen in the car will be so good that it\u2019s competitive with the phone. And\nyou\u2019ve already begun some of that stuff. There\u2019s Zoom in a Mercedes right now,\nI believe. You have these applications. You have these abilities.\n\nBut it\u2019s not only that. If I go back to that, you talked about marrying the\nmap to the assistant system \u2014 well, you have to have the car domain to be able\nto do that.\n\nThat\u2019s true.\n\nThat\u2019s not a trivial thing, by the way.\n\nI believe you. I have no reason not to. But I look at your specific example of\nwatching television, and I look around, and I see most people have stopped\nwatching [television]. They were watching their phones, even in their own\nhomes. They turn on Netflix, and they look at their phones at the same time.\nYou see that behavior is incredibly hard to crack. And then, on top of it,\npart of the bet in all that investment is that you\u2019ll be able to monetize the\nexperiences in the car the way that the phone platforms have been able to\nmonetize, the way that Apple and Google have been able to monetize. Is that\nplaying out? Do you see people using your app store, using your e-commerce\nabilities, using the platform in a way that suggests you can get to the mobile\nmarket style monetization? Because I listened to Mary Barra at GM, and that\u2019s\nthe bet that they\u2019re making. Then I talked to Jim Rowan at Volvo, and he says,\n\u201cThat\u2019s crazy. We\u2019re never going to have the scale to do that. Just CarPlay\nit.\u201d And so there\u2019s a pretty big extreme in this industry.\n\nSome things you can monetize \u2014 some things you can\u2019t. We had a tech day on\nMercedes-Benz operating system, MBOS, in California at our Sunnyvale tech hub\ntwo years ago where \u2014 and you can watch that presentation, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s out\nthere somewhere \u2014 we talked about that monetization. What can you monetize,\nand what can\u2019t you monetize? We take, I would say, a sober view on how much\nrevenue and profit pool you can drive with that. I don\u2019t think it would be\nrealistic to say, \u201cOh, this is going to be tens of billions of revenue,\u201d and\nso on and so forth. And that\u2019s not what we said. But everything that gets more\nand more close to the original know-how and IP of the carmaker, where you can\nmonetize, will be things like different types of assisted driving, autonomous\ndriving \u2014 not go crazy, but in the project that we\u2019re working with Nvidia [on]\nto develop the next generation autonomous drive for our cars, you\u2019ll have a\nlot of different functions. And yes, of course, you can monetize that.\n\nWe have been monetizing driver-assistance systems. We are the inventors of\ndriver-assistance systems. We have been monetizing it now for almost 30 years.\nSo, in the ADAS [advanced driver-assistance system] domain, there is more. In\nthe infotainment domain, much of it will be just part of the car. It\u2019s just\npart of the car. But there are things that you can throw in there as well. You\ncan turn your car into monitoring your driveway and be almost like a burglar\nalarm and stuff like that once you have all the sensing and so on. So, there\nare pockets here and there.\n\nBut also, we talked about the insane Hyperscreen \u2014 it\u2019s a digital sculpture.\nIt\u2019s not a screen \u2014 it\u2019s a beautiful object. It\u2019s a piece of art. We also sell\nthe hardware in the car as well. So, it\u2019s a combo of that. All in all, we are\nmonetizing, but I think also you need to be realistic. We\u2019re not turning\nourselves into a mobile phone company; that\u2019s not who we are. We\u2019re not in\nprimary competition with Apple or Google or whoever around the world in that.\nIn fact, we have great partnerships with these companies and work very well\nwith them.\n\nLook at what we did with Apple Music and Dolby Atmos on the music experience:\nif you\u2019re into music, that is concert hall quality. I\u2019ve never heard music in\na car at better quality. If you close your eyes, you\u2019ll think you are at the\nElbphilharmonie in Hamburg, which is supposed to be the best acoustic building\nin the world or something like that. It is great. So, it\u2019s not the issue, and\nwe don\u2019t think in those terms. Take care of the customer. Create the best\ndigital customer experience. Partner with companies like Google and Apple\nwhere it makes sense for them and for us. But be the architecture of your\ndigital environment in the car. And as I said before, it\u2019s no less than the\nbrain and the central nervous system of your vehicle. You can\u2019t outsource\nthat.\n\nLet\u2019s wrap up and talk about AI. We\u2019ve been talking about monetization and\ncosts and what you can monetize and what you can\u2019t. There is ChatGPT in the\nMercedes car, in the Mercedes operating system right now, in MBUX. It feels\nlike it\u2019s just there to be cool. It\u2019s a cool thing to add to an operating\nsystem like that. There\u2019s no business model that really works for ChatGPT,\nright? Or for any of the big LLM-style AIs. Next to that, you have autonomy,\nwhich, at some level, people are going to start charging subscription services\nfor. That seems to make sense because of the ongoing mapping and improvements\nyou need. Do you see a path forward for the ChatGPT-style AI in the car?\nBecause the whole industry is confused about that.\n\nDefinitely. The next level is this \u2014 and we actually showed it at the CES in\nVegas in January. You\u2019ve got to now start training that AI to be more specific\nto your environment. You take the world, the knowledge of the world. Of\ncourse, you don\u2019t say no to that. The knowledge of the world is \u2014 I think I\nused the analogy last time we talked about this: This is your Jarvis, your\nIron Man. And Jarvis knows everything. It is like your digital brain that is\nhelping you negotiate any situation, but you need to now train your Jarvis for\nthe Mercedes world to make it more relevant for everything that is going on in\nthe car. And we are working on what we call the Mercedes virtual assistant,\nwhich means common knowledge plus specific knowledge to give you ultimately a\nJarvis in the car. That\u2019s where it\u2019s going.\n\nThat\u2019s a great vision. But right now, ChatGPT hallucinates. It is frequently\nwrong. I don\u2019t trust it to do a lot of things. In the general case, LLMs have,\nI think, hit a ceiling, and we\u2019ll see if that ceiling gets higher over time.\nIn very specific cases, you can see how they\u2019re useful. You can see how people\nare tailoring them and focusing them. Jarvis is a very general case. How do\nyou go from \u201cWe have it in the car today; we need to tailor it to the car\u201d all\nthe way to Jarvis and, by the way, pay the fees necessary? I don\u2019t want to pay\nanother $20 to use the Mercedes assistant in my car. Which is how much ChatGPT\ncosts today.\n\nStep by step. It\u2019s back to the customer experience. Maybe you want to have\nvery specific answers on the destination you\u2019re going to or the type of\nrestaurant and what they have on the menu. You navigate automatically to that.\nAll of those things \u2014 specific questions that don\u2019t yet work today but which\nwould add a layer of convenience \u2014 that\u2019s the direction. That is absolutely\nthe direction. Of course, our ChatGPT integration in the cars right now is a\nbeta. But if you don\u2019t start learning, you\u2019ve got to jump and start. And we\ntell our customers that right now, that is beta. I use ChatGPT also for a lot\nof search cases, but I\u2019m also careful if I feel that the answer is a little\nbit of gobbledygook. You need to be a semi-intelligent interpreter of the\nanswer as well, of course. So, we are going to start training a Mercedes-Benz\nvirtual assistant and gradually add use cases for you.\n\nDo you think this is something where you\u2019re going to look at different model\nproviders over time? You\u2019re going to build your own model? You\u2019re going to\nstick with OpenAI? What does that look like for you? Because that\u2019s a pretty\nkey dependency here for the product.\n\nI know that, but competition is rising in that space now. There\u2019s always a\ncompany that\u2019s going to be the first one out. I don\u2019t know how many billions\nand billions and billions are going into this by many, many players, so I can\nsee how competition is starting to rise here now. And we do what we always do:\nwe assess the options and pick the partner that we think is the best partner.\n\nThat\u2019s great. Well, Ola, you\u2019ve announced at least two cars here today, one a\nreal car and one that you promised to come back [to share] when it\u2019s real. You\nrevealed some of your roadmap, and you\u2019ve told us that you\u2019re building Jarvis.\nI think this is a pretty good episode of Decoder.
