For years it\u2019s been a mainstay in the mechanic\u2019s repertoire for\nunsticking stuck things. From rusted nuts and bolts to pieces that once\nslipped smoothly together, there isn\u2019t much a torch can\u2019t fix. There are,\nunfortunately, a lot of things a torch can burn to a crisp. Trying to protect\nthose things while directing a blazing torch can be a challenge\u2014I\u2019d be lying\nif I said I never set anything alight using a torch.\n\nNot long ago, I was trying to replace rubber body mounts on my truck and\nencountered multiple frozen body mount bolts. Using a torch to heat up those\nbolts enough to get them free was near impossible without setting the rubber\nbushings on fire. Referring to YouTube, to see if there were any tricks to\ncompleting this job, I found someone using an induction heater to get the\nbolts free. I had seen these devices before, but not in a handheld version.\n\nTrevor Raab\n\nSome quick research revealed that they were available on Amazon, weren\u2019t all\nthat expensive, and could arrive as soon as the next day. There were a bunch\nof options to chose from and they all looked basically the same, although at\nvarying prices. I settled on the 1000-watt Solary Magnetic Induction Heater\nKit for $180. It was also available with a case and a selection of different\nsized coils for $216.\n\nI also found a more expensive version of the same type of tool, the 1800-watt\nBolt Buster. By the specs, the Bolt Buster has a lot more power than the model\nI got, and If I was still working as a mechanic, I would have chosen it\ninstead. But, judging by the reviews it seemed like the Solary Induction\nHeater would work for what I was doing\u2014and, because it would arrive the next\nday, I could finish the job and use my truck.\n\n## How Induction Heaters Work\n\nA high frequency, alternating current (AC) is passed through a coil to create\nan electromagnetic field. Eddy currents occur in an item placed within the\nfield, or coil, provided they are comprised of electrically conductive\nmaterials. The friction generated by these eddy currents provides focused,\nnon-contact heating.\n\nTrevor Raab\n\nHeating up a rusty nut on an old John Deere planter.\n\nTrevor Raab\n\nAfter being heated up, the rusty nut came off without much effort.\n\nFor my project, the Solary Magnetic Induction Heater kit I ordered, worked as\ndescribed. I was able to heat and remove the stubborn body mount bolts on my\ntruck relatively easily. It did take a little longer than the 30 seconds\nadvertised, but they were large bolts, and they heated up enough to break\nloose. Since then I\u2019ve used it a couple times, testing it on various sized\nrusty nuts and bolts\u2014and it\u2019s really kind of surprising how well it actually\nworks. The best thing is that I don\u2019t need to use a torch around things that\nit could cause problems, like wiring harnesses, fuel tanks, or brake lines.\nWhile it\u2019s not a tool you\u2019ll likely use every day, it is one that can get you\nout of a bind with seized hardware.\n\nBradley Ford\n\nTest Editor\n\nBrad Ford has spent most of his life using tools to fix, build, or make\nthings.
