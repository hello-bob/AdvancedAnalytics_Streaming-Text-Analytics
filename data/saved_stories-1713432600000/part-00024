That's because time\nticks by faster on the moon relative to Earth.\n\nThe difference is very small, but space flight needs extreme precision. And\nwhen lunar spacecraft and satellites operate on an Earth-based time standard,\nthat difference could create problems, according to a memo issued by the White\nHouse Office of Science and Technology Policy this month.\n\n### Space\n\n### If daylight saving time seems tricky, try figuring out the time on the\nmoon\n\nThe new lunar time zone, Coordinated Lunar Time (LTC), is all about ensuring\nthe success of future, multinational missions to the moon, said Michelle\nHanlon, the executive director of the Center for Air and Space Law at the\nUniversity of Mississippi.\n\n\"It's not just the U.S. going back to the moon by itself. We are going as the\nArtemis partners \u2014 right now, 36 nations \u2014 and they are spread out across the\nglobe. So we've got to figure out one way where we can talk to everybody in\nthe same time,\" she said.\n\nThe LTC would not be like a regular time zone on Earth. On Earth, those zones\nare set using Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which reflects a weighted\naverage measurement of hundreds of extremely precise atomic clocks placed\naround the globe.\n\nEnlarge this image\n\nThe creation of a lunar time zone would require international agreements. NASA\nJohnson hide caption\n\ntoggle caption\n\nNASA Johnson\n\nThe creation of a lunar time zone would require international agreements.\n\nNASA Johnson\n\nDue to the moon's lower gravity and its motion relative to Earth, moon time\npasses 56 microseconds faster each earth day. As a result, an atomic clock on\nEarth would run at a different rate than an atomic clock on the moon.\n\nSimilar to how UTC is determined, the memo suggests \"an ensemble of clocks\"\ndeployed to the moon might be used to set the new time standard.\n\nThe memo also notes the creation of the LTC would require international\nagreements.\n\nHanlon said taking this step towards a unified approach to space travel is\nimportant for establishing international collaboration on the moon.\n\n\"I hope that this is the beginning of a collaboration. When we think about the\ngeopolitical circumstances down here on Earth, it doesn't look particularly\nhopeful,\" she said.\n\n### Finding Time\n\n### Researchers say time is an illusion. So why are we all obsessed with it?\n\nHanlon said that because several players in today's space race are looking to\nland near the moon's south pole, figuring out an international standard will\nbe crucial.\n\n\"We all agree that space should be exclusively for peaceful purposes. We all\nagree that we have free access and freedom of exploration and use,\" she said.\n\n\"Let's all agree on how we're going to tell time on the moon.\"\n\n  * time zone\n  * space exploration\n  * moon\n  * science\n  * White House\n  * space\n  * NASA\n  * Time\n  * Joe Biden\n  * technology\n\n###### Read & Listen\n\n  * Home\n  * News\n  * Culture\n  * Music\n  * Podcasts & Shows\n\n###### Connect\n\n  * Newsletters\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * Press\n  * Public Editor\n  * Corrections\n  * Contact & Help\n\n###### About NPR\n\n  * Overview\n  * Diversity\n  * NPR Network\n  * Accessibility\n  * Ethics\n  * Finances\n\n###### Get Involved\n\n  * Support Public Radio\n  * Sponsor NPR\n  * NPR Careers\n  * NPR Shop\n  * NPR Events\n  * NPR Extra\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy\n  * Your Privacy Choices\n  * Text Only\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor\n\n## Cookie Consent & Sponsorship Choices\n\nWe and our 156 partners store and/or access information on a device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies to process personal data.
