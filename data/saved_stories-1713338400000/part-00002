What if you quit? Left for a better job? Retired? Got a\ntransfer? A promotion?\n\nIf your job ends, does that mean you failed? And if a business \u201cfails\u201d to\nendure, does that mean the entrepreneur failed? Isn\u2019t every business going to\nfail eventually? Even Microsoft?\n\nIf a business fails to endure, does that mean it could be considered a\nfailure? Does \u201cfail\u201d mean that the business produced nothing of value or\nprovided no revenue to the owner(s)? What if an employee is hired and then\n\u201cfails\u201d after a number of years? Does that mean s/he did nothing the whole\ntime and shouldn\u2019t have been hired in the first place? Of course not...\n\nDon\u2019t let goofy statistics discourage you from going the entrepreneurial route\nif you find it attractive. While a business or a job may cease to endure after\na certain number of years, that doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t worth doing. You\u2019re\nstill going to learn and grow and create value along the way, regardless of\nthe outcome. Just as a job can be a stepping stone, so can a business, and\nthere\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t start a new business with the expectation that\nit\u2019s only temporary. Jobs and businesses come and go. Your own personal growth\nis what endures.\n\nMy first and only stint as an employee lasted six months. My first business\nlasted 11 years and is still going. Go figure.\n\nReceive Steve's new articles by email.\n\n### Read related articles:\n\nAre You A Failure Germaphobe?\n\nYou Have the Right to Be Wrong\n\nWhat Will Other People Think of You?\n\nSelf-Discipline\n\nMy Wife Won\u2019t Let Me Start My Own Business\n\nYour Relationship with Failure\n\nShare Your Shame\n\n\u2190 The Light at the End of the TunnelYou Need People \u2192\n\n## Unlock Your Full Potential with Steve's Transformative Courses\n\nExplore our range of immersive courses designed to help you grow, align with\nyour values, and create the life you truly desire.
