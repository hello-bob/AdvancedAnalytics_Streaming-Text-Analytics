Credit: S. Dutta et al.\n\nEgg cells are the largest single cells on the planet. Their size\u2014often several\nto hundreds of times the size of a typical cell\u2014allows them to grow into\nentire organisms, but it also makes it difficult to transport nutrients and\nother molecules around the cell. Scientists have long known that maturing egg\ncells, called oocytes, generate internal, twister-like fluid flows to\ntransport nutrients, but how those flows arise in the first place has been a\nmystery.\n\nNow, research led by computational scientists at the Flatiron Institute, along\nwith collaborators at Princeton and Northwestern universities, has revealed\nthat these flows\u2014which look like microscopic tornados\u2014arise organically from\nthe interactions of a few cellular components.\n\nTheir work, published in Nature Physics, used theory, advanced computer\nmodeling, and experiments with fruit fly egg cells to uncover the twisters'\nmechanics. The results are helping scientists better understand foundational\nquestions about egg cell development and cellular transport.\n\n\"Our findings represent a big leap in this field,\" says co-author Michael\nShelley, director of the Flatiron Institute's Center for Computational Biology\n(CCB). \"We were able to apply advanced numerical techniques from other\nresearch that we've been developing for years, which allow us a much better\nlook at this issue than has ever been possible before.\"\n\nIn a typical human cell, it takes only 10 to 15 seconds for a typical protein\nmolecule to meander from one side of the cell to the other via diffusion; in a\nsmall bacterial cell, this trip can happen in just a single second. But in the\nfruit fly egg cells studied here, diffusion alone would take an entire\nday\u2014much too long for the cell to function properly. Instead, these egg cells\nhave developed 'twister flows' that circle around the interior of the oocyte\nto distribute proteins and nutrients quickly, just as a tornado can pick up\nand move material much farther and quicker than wind alone.\n\n00:00\n\n00:09\n\nThis looping simulation shows how the movement of microtubules creates\nswirling flows in a cell. Credit: S. Dutta et al.\n\n\"After it's fertilized, the oocyte will become the future animal,\" says study\nco-author Sayantan Dutta, a researcher at Princeton and the CCB. \"If you\ndestroy the flow in the oocyte, the resulting embryo doesn't develop.\"\n\nThe researchers used an advanced open-source biophysics software package\ncalled SkellySim developed by Flatiron Institute researchers.\n\nWith SkellySim, they modeled the cellular components involved in creating the\ntwisters. These include microtubules\u2014flexible filaments that line the inside\nof a cell\u2014and molecular motors, which are specialized proteins that serve as\ncellular workhorses, carrying special groups of molecules known as payloads.\nScientists aren't exactly sure what these payloads are made of, but they play\na key role in generating the flows.\n\nThe researchers simulated the motion of thousands of microtubules as they\nresponded to the forces exerted by payload-carrying molecular motors. By going\nback and forth between experiments and their simulations, the researchers were\nable to understand the structure of the twister flows and how they arose from\nthe interaction between the cellular fluid and microtubules.\n\n\"Our theoretical work allows us to zoom in and actually measure and visualize\nthese twisters in 3D,\" says study co-author and CCB research scientist Reza\nFarhadifar. \"We saw how these microtubules can generate large-scale flows just\nthrough self-organization, without any external cues.\"\n\n00:00\n\n00:00\n\nIn this looping video of an oocyte cell, material can be seen circulating and\nhelping distribute nutrients throughout the growing cell. Credit: S. Dutta et\nal.\n\nThe models revealed that inside the oocyte, microtubules buckle under the\nforce of the molecular motors. When a microtubule buckles or bends under this\nload, it causes the surrounding fluid to move, which can reorient other\nmicrotubules.\n\nIn a large enough group of bending microtubules, all the microtubules bend in\nthe same direction, and the fluid flows become 'cooperative.' With the\nmicrotubules collectively bent, the moving payloads create a whirlpool or\ntwister-like flow across the whole egg, helping molecules disperse around the\ncell. With the twisters, molecules can travel across the cell in 20 minutes\ninstead of 20 hours.\n\n\"The model showed the system has an incredible capacity for organizing itself\nto create this functional flow,\" Shelley says. \"And you just need a few\ningredients\u2014only microtubules, the geometry of the cell, and molecular motors\ncarrying payloads.\"\n\nThe new findings lay the foundation for a better understanding of egg cell\ndevelopment. The results could also help demystify material transport in other\ncell types.\n\n\"Now that we know how these twisters form, we can ask deeper questions, like\nhow do they mix the molecules inside the cell?\" Farhadifar says. \"This opens a\nnew dialogue between theory and experiment.\"\n\nThe new work provides a fresh look at microtubules, Dutta says. Microtubules\nplay a central role in various cell types and cell functions\u2014such as cell\ndivision\u2014across almost all eukaryotic organisms, such as plants and animals.\nThat makes them \"a very important part of a cell's toolbox,\" Dutta says.\n\n\"In better understanding their mechanisms, I think our model will help drive\nthe development in a lot of other really interesting problems in cellular\nbiophysics.\"\n\nMore information: Sayantan Dutta et al, Self-organized intracellular twisters,\nNature Physics (2024).
