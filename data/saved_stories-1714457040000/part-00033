This includes:\n\n  * 5 lists of 3,500+ investors.\n\n  * 7 tools for tracking and talking with investors.\n\n  * 18 templates for different emails to investors.\n\n  * 3 learning resources.\n\nAnd as a thank you for being a Failory subscriber, I\u2019m giving you a 67%\ndiscount.\n\n# The Strategy\n\n## The Calculator\n\nSome years ago, the Wise marketing team realized that many people looking to\nsend money internationally were also searching Google for the exchange rate\nbetween two currencies.\n\nThis gave them an idea: they created an exchange rate calculator and added a\nlist at the bottom comparing the prices for sending money abroad with\ndifferent providers.\n\nBecause Wise charges lower fees than most of its competitors, it usually\nappears at the top of the list, prompting users to use its services.\n\nThis is an example of Side Project Marketing, which involves creating useful\ntools like calculators, quizzes, aggregators, or converters to promote your\ncompany to potential customers.\n\nThis side project should address what your potential customers are seeking,\nbut it shouldn't be a core feature of your product or aim to generate revenue\nindependently.\n\nThis calculator, for example, ranks very well on keywords like \u201cexchange rate\ncalculator,\u201d which gets over 50K searches per month. Anyone seeking this tool\ncould potentially become a Wise client.\n\nThus, it's worth investing in crafting a side project to rank high for this\nkeyword and draw in new customers.\n\n### An Even Better Idea\n\nThis calculator alone could have performed adequately and likely attracted\nthousands of new clients to Wise each month.\n\nHowever, the marketing team had an even better idea.\n\nThey noticed that many individuals seeking exchange rate calculators weren't\nnecessarily using that exact keyword in Google. Instead, they searched for the\nexchange rate between two particular currencies, such as \"USD to EUR rate.\"\n\nSo, they decided to create thousands of pages for all possible currency\ncombinations. On each of these pages, users would discover the calculator pre-\nloaded with their desired currencies.\n\nThis is why, if you search for the keyword \u201cUSD to EUR rate,\u201d one of the top\nresults is a page on Wise\u2019s website titled \u201cUS dollars to Euros Exchange\nRate.\u201d This page has the same calculator but stands as its own distinct page,\ncomplete with its unique heading and keywords.\n\nThis is clever because it is much easier for this specific page to rank for\nthe \u201cUSD to EUR rate\u201d keyword than for the default exchange calculator page.\n\nSome quick math will tell us that there are thousands of possible combinations\nbetween all currencies. Wise has made a specific page for each of these\ncombinations, and they all rank among the top results.\n\nWhile each of these niche keywords, like \u201cGBP to EUR\u201d has a small number of\nsearches, when combined, they bring a massive pool of visitors to Wise\u2019s\nwebsite.\n\nBut how did Wise manage to create thousands of pages? Did they have interns\ntoiling away full-time to build a new website for each possible combination?\n\nNot quite. They harnessed the power of automation.\n\nAnd here lies the key to what this strategy, known as Programmatic SEO, is all\nabout.\n\nIt involves utilizing programming and automation to generate thousands of\nunique pages targeting less competitive, long-tail keywords with relatively\nfew searches. However, when aggregated, these keywords attract a significant\ninflux of new visitors.\n\nIt is an extremely powerful strategy that requires little time or resources to\npull off. Wise probably created these thousand pages in a couple of hours.\n\n### Programmatic SEO to the Max\n\nNot content with having all these pages, the Wise marketing team decided to\npush the strategy even further.\n\nThey realized that some people were searching for the specific quantities they\nwanted to exchange, such as \u201c100 USD to EUR\u201d. So, they created pages for\nsignificant amounts of currencies in all languages.\n\nAnd when I say \"significant amounts,\" I mean they created pages for nearly\nevery typical number. They didn't just stop at a page for \"100 USD to EUR,\"\nbut also crafted pages for exchanges like \"196 Dollars to Euros\" or \"287\nDollars to Euros.\"\n\nThe result of this combination of the Side Project Marketing strategy and an\nextreme version of Programmatic SEO is that Wise was able to create 258,065\npages, which brings them 40.7M organic users per month.\n\n### Converting Visitors into Customers\n\nAll of this effort makes no sense if you cannot convert visitors into\ncustomers.\n\nWise achieves this in multiple ways:\n\n  * Firstly, the calculator itself has a \u201cSend Money\u201d button, which drives the visitor to a signup page:\n\n  * Additionally, they strategically place this banner directly below the calculator:\n\n  * Moreover, they added a section trying to convince users that using Wise is a better alternative than using their banks:\n\n  * Finally, they offer users the option to set alerts for specific exchange rates. This allows them to collect their email address and then send promotional emails to convert them into customers:\n\nAll of this allows Wise to convert a significant portion of the calculator's\nvisitors into customers.\n\n# Should I?\n\n## Why This Works\n\n  * The Side Project Marketing works because the calculator directly addresses the user\u2019s search intent. When users search for \u201c100 USD to EUR\u201d they want to get the answer quickly and easily. The calculator satisfies this need, and the fact that it comes preloaded with the desired currencies and amounts makes it even better.\n\n  * The keyword \u201cexchange rate calculator\u201d has a high search volume and is quite competitive. On the other hand, long-tail keywords such as \"150 USD to EUR\" are less competitive yet yield lower search volumes individually. However, targeting these long-tail keywords is an excellent strategy as they are easier to rank for and, collectively, amass a substantially higher search volume.\n\n  * The pages are created following a template, so the marginal cost of creating a new one is almost zero. This means that even if a page only brings ten users to your website, you can make it because it has no cost. When doing content marketing, each article you write has a cost, which means there are plenty of keywords that are not worth targeting.\n\n## How to Apply It\n\n  1. Find the Side Project: Think about a tool that people in your industry might find helpful. In the case of Wise, this was the exchange rate calculator. Another example is Hatchful, a free logo maker made by Shopify. The idea here is that a founder looking for a logo might also be interested in an e-commerce platform.\n\n  2. Find all possible keywords: Think of all the potential keywords for which you could re-purpose your tool. Wise re-purposed the calculator to every possible currency combination and many specific conversion amounts. You can try adapting your tool to other languages if that makes sense.\n\n  3. Create a Template: Design the structure of each page. While all pages will share common elements (such as the calculator in Wise's case), they will also feature unique components (like the title or selected currencies). The crucial aspect is ensuring each page is distinctive and tailored to the specific user search intent. Let's see how Wise adapts each page:\n\n     * Each page is written in the corresponding language.\n\n     * Each page has a title that includes the currencies and the conversion amount.\n\n     * The calculator has the currencies and the amount already selected.\n\n     * There\u2019s a chart showing the exchange rate history for the two currencies.\n\n     * A table compares the exchange rates of the selected currencies and the specific amount for different international money exchange services.\n\n     * There\u2019s a 3-step guide on how to convert one currency to the other.\n\nIn addition to these steps, there are several other things to keep in mind:\n\n  * Make sure to have a hub where you link to all the programmatically-created pages so that Google finds out about them and crawls them.\n\n  * Enrich these pages using AI. This will allow you to add unique content to each page and avoid having all pages look identical.\n\n  * Implement multiple strategies to convert visitors into customers. For instance, Wise employs various calls-to-action (CTAs). Additionally, they have a way to collect visitors\u2019 email addresses through the conversion rate alerts newsletter, in case they can\u2019t turn them into customers right away.\n\n## Yes, But\n\n  * It can be hard to start: While it's simple to whip up new pages once you've got your template sorted, finding the ideal side project and figuring out the design and conversion tactics for these pages isn't a walk in the park. It calls for a mix of design, engineering, and marketing know-how.\n\n  * Hard to maintain: Recurring updates are required to make sure you keep ranking high in the SERPs. Since you need to update hundreds or thousands of pages, you must find a way to do it automatically.\n\n  * It could be a bit dangerous: If you create thousands of pages for spamming purposes, Google will not like it. There are a series of bad practices you should definitely avoid when doing Programmatic SEO. That being said, as long as you satisfy a user search intent through your pages, you should be fine.\n\n# Keep Learning\n\n## Others Playing It\n\nPayroll startup Gusto has created two tools for people to calculate their\nhourly or salary paycheck and payroll.\n\nBecause paychecks vary between US states as each one has different taxes, they\ncreated 105 of these calculators, targeting every US state.\n\nThese pages are different in that the calculator takes into account the taxes\nof each specific state. See the California Hourly Payroll Calculator.\n\nThe hourly and salary calculators collectively get 17K users per month. The\nstate-focused calculators collectively get 88K users per month. This is the\npower of pSEO.\n\n## Go Deeper\n\n  * Here\u2019s how Failory gets 100K users/mo with pSEO.\n\n  * Here\u2019s a talk I gave at MicroConf on how I do pSEO with no-code tools.\n\n  * This is the story behind Zapier\u2019s programmatically-created Integration pages.\n\n  * Here\u2019s my guide to Side-Project Marketing (aka.
