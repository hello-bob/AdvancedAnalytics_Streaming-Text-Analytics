There are some software stocks with\ndirect exposure, but perhaps the best place to look is where the benefits of\nAI aren't as easily recognized.\n\nThere's one overlooked AI powerhouse in particular that should use the\ntechnology to create large value for investors, even if the market hasn't\ncaught on just yet.\n\n## NYSE: SHOP\n\nShopify\n\nToday's Change\n\n(3.91%) $2.91\n\nCurrent Price\n\n$77.37\n\nSHOP\n\n### Key Data Points\n\nMarket Cap\n\n$96B\n\nDay's Range\n\n$74.42 - $77.80\n\n52wk Range\n\n$45.50 - $91.57\n\nVolume\n\n11,029,969\n\nAvg Vol\n\n8,979,020\n\nGross Margin\n\n50.18%\n\nDividend Yield\n\nN/A\n\n## Shopify: A wonderful business even without AI\n\nShopify (SHOP 3.91%) is a wonderful stock even before diving into its AI\nupside. The company launched in 2006 after a pair of entrepreneurs attempted\nto start an online storefront for their snowboarding business. Disappointed\nwith the lack of technology options for creating digital storefronts, one of\nthe entrepreneurs with experience in coding decided to build his own. The\nresult was the Shopify e-commerce platform: a one-stop shop for individuals\nand businesses looking to start selling online.\n\nIt turns out that Shopify's founders weren't the only ones dissatisfied with\nthe market's options for building an online store. More than 1 million stores\nnow run on the company's platform. Last quarter, Shopify-powered stores\nprocessed more than $75 billion in purchases.\n\nAccording to data compiled by Statista, Shopify currently has a 28% market\nshare for e-commerce platforms in the U.S. That is, there's nearly a one-third\nchance that a person looking to set up an online storefront will choose\nShopify. The next closest platform is WooCommerce, commanding a market share\nof just 17%.\n\nSHOP Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nThe e-commerce market is a great industry to be exposed to in your investment\nportfolio. E-commerce sales worldwide are expected to grow at nearly 10% per\nyear through at least 2029. Companies that ride this rising tide will win.\n\nWith a leading market share, Shopify is particularly primed to benefit from\nthis trend. That's because its technology is a platform, meaning outside\ndevelopers can build on top of it. If there's a feature you'd like to see on\nthe platform, for instance, you can build it yourself and charge others a fee\nwhen they use this feature.\n\nHundreds of millions of dollars are paid to outside developers per year for\ntheir contributions. As it is the biggest e-commerce platform, developers\nflock to Shopify because it offers the best opportunity to make money selling\nto as many users as possible. Shopify, meanwhile, essentially has a\ndistributed workforce thousands strong that it only needs to pay whenever a\nnew feature is built and adopted.\n\nThis scale gives Shopify an enviable economic moat. Developers want to\ncontribute to the largest platform possible to maximize profits. Users,\nmeanwhile, want to use the most robust platform possible. With Shopify's\nsizable lead over the competition, these competitive advantages will only\nstrengthen as time goes on. AI, it turns out, could put this advantage on\nsteroids.\n\n## AI will put Shopify's competitive advantage on steroids\n\nBecause Shopify has attracted so many developers to its e-commerce platform,\nit should be a prime beneficiary of AI -- but don't just take my word for it.\nMorgan Stanley analysts recently listed Shopify as one of its biggest AI\nwinners over the long term. Why?\n\nMost importantly, Shopify will be able to integrate more AI features into its\nplatform at a faster speed than any competitor. That's because its platform is\nmost attractive for AI developers looking to launch e-commerce tools and\nfeatures.\n\nThe company also has the funds and scale to launch its own internally\ndeveloped AI features. Last year, for example, it launched Shopify Magic,\nwhich automates many time-consuming aspects of online retailing, like writing\nproduct descriptions, optimizing product photos, and chatting with customers.\n\n\"Our strategy involves integrating AI at the heart of our platform,\" Shopify\nPresident Harley Finkelstein stressed on the company's latest conference call,\n\"simplifying the process for merchants to expand their businesses and adapt to\nthe ever-evolving commerce landscape.\"\n\nWith Shopify's ability to out-invest the competition when it comes to both\ninternally and externally developed AI solutions, this vision is very\nachievable. While quarterly revenue growth rates have fallen recently, the\ncontinued integration of AI into its platform should help keep growth rates at\nShopify elevated for longer than the market anticipates.\n\nRyan Vanzo has positions in Shopify.
