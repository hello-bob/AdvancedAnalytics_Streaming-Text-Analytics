I started at the company in\nSeptember 2022 with very little security experience.\n\nOne of the people who interviewed me even called me out saying \"You don't seem\ntoo passionate about security.\"\n\nWas honestly a little offended... But he was right! My only work experience\nwas two years of digital transformation work at Deloitte. And even though\nsecurity was a critical part of my work, I wasn't particularly passionate\nabout it \u2014 which seemed to be evident.\n\n\"You need to be passionate about the work we do and what we sell. Otherwise,\nour customers are going to notice.\"\n\nHe had a point.\n\nNonetheless, I got the job. And after a handful of sales calls with CISOs and\nCTOs, I quickly realized what he meant. The people we sell to know their stuff\nand can easily sniff out bullshit.\n\nI developed a horrible case of imposter syndrome and knew I needed to do\nsomething about it.\n\nSo I made it a goal to develop a passion for security by immersing myself in\nit \u2014 subscribing to security newsletters, listening to security podcasts, and\nsubscribing to YesWeHack.\n\nBut no matter how much security content I consumed, I couldn't shake that\nimposter syndrome \u2014 which isn't good because SEs are supposed to be the\nconfident, technical voices in the room.\n\n##\n\nWhy I decided to take the CISSP as a sales engineer\n\nI was selling well, but I knew my lack of security knowledge was holding me\nback. So after a year at the company, I approached my boss for help. He\nrecommended I get a certification, listing a few I should consider \u2014\nSecurity+, CISSP, and AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner.\n\nI took his recommendations and hit the forums for advice.\n\nAfter scanning r/cybersecurity, r/salesengineers, and r/cissp, I decided I\nwanted to pursue a CISSP \u2014 mile wide and inch deep was exactly what I was\nlooking for. My thought process was I just needed enough to be able to speak\nthe same language as the CISOs and security leaders I was selling to.\n\n##\n\nMy 10-week study plan to pass the CISSP with minimal security experience\n\nSo I developed a 10-week study plan, registered for the exam, and purchased my\nstudy materials.\n\nAt a high level, my study plan was as follows \u2014 cover one domain every week,\nand then spend the last two weeks doing as many practice exams as possible.\n\nFull disclosure: the materials I used to \"cover one domain every week\" changed\nthroughout my studies, but I did stick with the overall plan.\n\nI started my study plan on January 1st, 2024 with the following materials:\n\n  1. The Official Study Guide\n\n  2. Pete Zerger's Exam Cram Videos\n\n  3. Destination CISSP Mind Map Videos\n\n###\n\nWeeks 1 - 2\n\nIn weeks one and two, I tackled the first domains with the following study\nplan:\n\n  1. Reading the domain-specific chapters in the OSG and taking notes\n\n  2. Doing the Review Questions and Written Labs at the end of every chapter\n\n  3. Watching Pete Zerger's Exam Cram video for the domain I was studying at the time\n\n  4. And then watching the Destination CISSP Mind Map videos for the domain I was studying\n\n###\n\nWeeks 3 - 8\n\nThen, during week three, my boss gifted me the Destination CISSP textbook \u2014\nwhich was 100x easier to read than the OSG \u2014 the Destination CISSP Workbook \u2014\nwhich gave my notes some structure \u2014 and I subscribed to the Learnzapp\nquestions \u2014 after hearing a lot of good stuff about them on r/cissp.\n\nSo for weeks three through eight \u2014 after adding some materials to my arsenal \u2014\nI changed my plan to:\n\n  1. Reading the Destination CISSP textbook\n\n  2. Filling out the Desintatino CISSP Workbook\n\n  3. Doing a handful of Learnzapp questions at the end of each Domain\n\n  4. Watching Pete Zerger's Exam Cram video for the domain I was studying at the time\n\n  5. And then watching the Destination CISSP Mind Map videos for the domain I was studying\n\nI followed this plan religiously until I covered all eight domains. Eight\nweeks down. Two to go!\n\nNow, onto the practice exams.\n\n###\n\nWeeks 9 - 10\n\nI followed Pete Zerger\u2019s 5-Step Strategy for reviewing and reinforcing what I\nhad learned in my first eight weeks of studying.\n\nThe strategy went something like this:\n\n  1. Take a practice exam (or set of study questions)\n\n  2. Review what you got wrong and do targeted reading\n\n  3. Review (and update) your notes to address gaps in your knowledge\n\n  4. Complete targeted practice problems in the domains you lack knowledge\n\n  5. Retake the same practice exam and then repeat with a new exam after that\n\nHere is my score progression during my last week of testing.\n\nI wish I had this insight when I was studying, so figured someone might also\nwant to see this stuff as well.\n\n  * Learnzapp Practice Test 1: 65%\n\n  * Four days before the exam \u2014 Learnzapp Practice Test 2: 73%\n\n  * Three days before the exam \u2014 Learnzapp Practice Test 3: 75%\n\n  * Two days before the exam \u2014 Learnzapp Practice Test 4: 76%\n\nI read somewhere that you know you are ready when you are consistently scoring\nabove 80% on practice exams.\n\nWell, I never got there and still passed. Not sure where I read that, but if\nthat\u2019s some sort of target for your studies, it\u2019s a good goal to have, but\ndon\u2019t beat yourself up or whig yourself out if you don\u2019t get there.\n\n###\n\nThe day before the exam\n\nThe day before the exam, I read through my notes in the Destination CISSP\nWorkbook and hung out for the rest of the day. Nothing crazy.\n\nLike I said, I was a little nervous that I never got to 80% proficiency in my\nstudies, HOWEVER, I had a plan and executed it perfectly.\n\nPlus, what could I really do the day before the exam that was going to make a\nbig difference?\n\n##\n\nExam day routine, coming damn near to failing, and then passing at the buzzer\n\nMy exam started at 8 AM and the exam center was 45 minutes away from my house.\n\nI woke up at 5 AM, ate a bagel, crushed a protein shake, and hit the road. I\ngot to the exam center an hour early \u2014 just in case \u2014 and began the test at 8\nAM sharp.\n\nThe first 50 questions were easy. I was pretty confident I\u2019d pass at 125\nquestions.\n\n> If you\u2019re not familiar with the CISSP exam, it\u2019s a CAT (computerized\n> adaptive examination) that delivers different questions based on how you are\n> performing in different learning domains. Candidates are asked a minimum of\n> 125 questions and a maximum of 175.\n>\n> If at question 125, the exam is 95% confident you\u2019ll pass given the\n> remaining 50 questions, then the exam ends and you pass!\n>\n> If at question 125, the exam is 5% confident you\u2019ll fail given the remaining\n> 50 questions, then the exam ends and you fail.\n>\n> And if at question 125, the exam is between 5% and 95% confident you\u2019ll pass\n> given the remaining questions, then you unlock another 50 questions to\n> demonstrate your proficiency (and hopefully pass).\n\nSo I was feeling good during the first part of the exam and thought I\u2019d be in\nthat 95%.\n\nWrong.\n\nTwo hours and fifteen minutes into the exam, I got whacked with question 126\nwith 45 minutes to spare...\n\nAt this point, I was certain I was going to fail.\n\nI started doing math in my head to figure out how much time I had for each of\nthe remaining 50 questions. I even started planning out when I was going to\nsit for the next exam.\n\nBut, I moved through the rest of the questions, my hand shaking on the mouse.\nAll I could think about was how much it would suck to have to tell my boss,\nfamily, and friends that I not only failed, but I failed because I ran out of\ntime \u2014 so dumb.\n\nI finished the exam with 45 seconds to spare.\n\nThe TA escorted me out of the testing room.\n\nAnd I was handed the notorious sheet of paper.\n\n\u201cCongratulations!\u201d\n\nThat was the only word I was looking for on that sheet.\n\nI shoved the paper in my pocket, thanked the person at the test center, walked\nto my car, and called all my family and friends to tell them the good news.\n\nPhew.\n\nI told myself I will pay my CISSP dues until the day I die. I will never sit\nfor that damn exam ever again.\n\nAs stressful as the last 45 minutes of the exam was, the whole thing was a\ngreat experience \u2014 choosing a certification, creating a plan, and getting it\ndone. I learned a lot along the way. And there\u2019s a slew of things I\u2019d tell\nmyself if I had to take the CISSP again\u2014 which I never will.\n\n##\n\n9 things I\u2019d tell myself if I had to take the CISSP again (which I absolutely\nnever will)\n\n  1. Prioritize practice problems: I spent a lot of time reading and taking notes, but doing more questions helped me learn faster and build my confidence. To be honest, part of my reluctance to really invest in practice problems earlier on in my studies was because I didn\u2019t want to fail. I didn\u2019t want to get questions wrong. Sounds stupid, but that\u2019s the truth. So don\u2019t be like me. Don't be scared to get things wrong at first. Because that\u2019s how you learn.\n\n  2. Practice your pacing: I didn\u2019t do this at all, and it almost cost me failing because I wasn\u2019t able to answer all the questions in time! The practice exams I completed were 125 questions, but if I was to do it again, I\u2019d practice with full-length exams of 175 questions instead. I\u2019d also stick with a set cadence of spending X seconds per question \u2014 I neither practiced that nor did it on the exam.\n\n  3. Buy the Destination Certification Crash Course: The Destination CISSP materials were awesome. I\u2019m really grateful my boss gave me the textbook and workbook. If I were to do it again, I\u2019d purchase the whole crash course. It was the most helpful material for me out of everything I studied.\n\n  4. Prioritize memorization techniques: Prioritize creating memory tricks to help remember things. I only did this in my last week of studying. It definitely would have made studying easier... There's a lot of material to learn, so don\u2019t feel bad if you need some tricks to memorize stuff. I know a lot of people will tell you \u201cWell you should really understand this stuff! You owe it to yourself and your employer\u201d And they\u2019re right. But also, there's a lot of stuff to know. Anyways, I highly recommend checking out Pete Zerger\u2019s video on memorization tips and techniques. Oh, and check out this post on r/cissp \u2014 wish I had found this prior to two days before my exam.\n\n  5. Review your notes early and often: I should have read my notes more often while studying. My notes were in my own words, so they helped me understand things more easily than reading the textbook \u2014 highly recommend the Destination CISSP Workbook.\n\n  6. Do more math problems: For math problems \u2014 or anything that needs a formula \u2014 , just practice them. At first, I had trouble with some math parts, but if I practiced more, I would have been fine. This video from Pete Zerger is great.\n\n  7. Have a study buddy: I wish I had a study buddy during my studies \u2014 someone who was following the same study plan as me who was along for the ride.\n\n  8. Avoid reading too many success / failure stories on r/cissp**:** There's a lot of good information in reading success / failure stories, but if you read too many of them, you\u2019ll drive yourself insane. Everyone\u2019s background, situation, and journeys are different. So use those stories as a way to build your plan, but once you have your plan, just stick to it and get to work.\n\n  9. As stressful as the last 45 minutes of the exam were, the whole thing was a great experience \u2014 choosing a certification, creating a plan, and getting it done. I learned a lot along the way. And there\u2019s a slew of things I\u2019d tell myself if I had to take the CISSP again\u2014 which I never will. stick with a set cadence of spending X seconds per question \u2014 I neither practiced that nor did it on the exam.nd I did the work! So I had nothing to worry about.\n\n##\n\nAdvice for those considering getting their CISSP or currently in the trenches\nstudying\n\nSo there you have it \u2014 my journey, study plan, exam woes, and lessons learned.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about taking the CISSP, do it. I thought it was an awesome\nexperience and I learned a ton \u2014 especially as a dude with little security\nexperience. It gave me the confidence I needed to do my job better.\n\nIf you\u2019re currently in the trenches, keep at it. Review your notes often, do\nlots of practice problems, and invest some time in creating some memory tricks\nto make your life easier. And last but not least, make sure to pace yourself\nso you\u2019re not trying to do 50 questions in 45 minutes like I had to. I do not\nwish that upon my worst enemy...\n\nThanks for reading Austin's Analects!
