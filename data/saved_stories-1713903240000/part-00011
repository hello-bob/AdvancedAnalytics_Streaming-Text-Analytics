The attack crippled the authority's services seven\nweeks ago and led to confidential documents being published online by the\nhackers, including rent statements and applications to buy council houses.\n\nA ransomware group of online criminals was behind the attack, which happened\non Thursday, March 7, and completely closed down the city council's IT\nsystems. And now a new problem has been revealed.\n\nBeaumont Leys resident Roger Ewens, 65, noticed the street lights in his road\nwere on constantly and asked the city council why. He was surprised when he\nreceived a reply blaming the cyber attack for affecting the \"central\nmanagement system\" and leading to the streetlights \"misbehaving\".\n\nREAD MORE: Leicester City Council says confidential documents including\npassport info shared online in cyber attack\n\nHe was told in the email he received today (Monday) that the problem should be\nsorted out by the end of next week. He told LeicestershireLive: \"The lights in\nmy area have been burning away all day and all night, so it's got to be\ncosting a lot.\n\nSIMILAR ARTICLES TO THIS\n\nPowered by\n\nCity centre offices being eyed up for flats\n\n14 Comments\n\nLeader of Leicester\u2019s Conservative Party returns to Labour fold 18 months\nafter quitting\n\n33 Comments\n\nTruth behind Leicester City\u2019s psychological title stumble as Enzo Maresca\n\u2018process\u2019 analysed\n\n9 Comments\n\nLeicester City have 'new solution' up their sleeve \u2013 but Enzo Maresca doesn't\nneed it yet\n\n14 Comments\n\nHinckley Road travel live updates as collision closes off main route\n\nComments\n\nDog attacks man trying to save his pet from mauling\n\n6 Comments\n\nTime running out to apply for voter ID in the upcoming police and crime\ncommissioner elections\n\n2 Comments\n\nThird boy arrested after Leicester stabbing\n\nComments\n\nMan charged after incident on roof of Leicester flat\n\nComments\n\nSearch for men after woman hospitalised by spiked drink\n\n13 Comments\n\nNew Leicestershire 'healthcare hub' will deal with 'thousands' of patients a\nyear\n\n2 Comments\n\nLeicester street lights stuck on all day due to cyber attack\n\n14 Comments\n\nCrash shuts A50 near Glenfield - live updates\n\nComments\n\nVideo shows armed trio robbing elderly shopkeeper in terrifying 3-minute raid\n\n20 Comments\n\nDeserted Leicester council offices being eyed up for 58 flats\n\n18 Comments\n\nLeicester to get new skatepark near Abbey Park\n\n11 Comments\n\n'Public nuisance' worries over bid for new 24-hour convenience store on\nNarborough Road\n\n7 Comments\n\nMore stolen data released by Leicester City Council cyber hackers in even\nbigger leak\n\n11 Comments\n\nCouncil proposes to borrow another \u00a31m to buy eight more homes for refugees\n\n101 Comments\n\nLeicester adventure playgrounds appeal to city mayor over withdrawal of\nfunding\n\n7 Comments\n\nCity centre offices being eyed up for flats\n\n14 Comments\n\nLeader of Leicester\u2019s Conservative Party returns to Labour fold 18 months\nafter quitting\n\n33 Comments\n\nTruth behind Leicester City\u2019s psychological title stumble as Enzo Maresca\n\u2018process\u2019 analysed\n\n9 Comments\n\nLeicester City have 'new solution' up their sleeve \u2013 but Enzo Maresca doesn't\nneed it yet\n\n14 Comments\n\nHinckley Road travel live updates as collision closes off main route\n\nComments\n\nDog attacks man trying to save his pet from mauling\n\n6 Comments\n\nTime running out to apply for voter ID in the upcoming police and crime\ncommissioner elections\n\n2 Comments\n\nThird boy arrested after Leicester stabbing\n\nComments\n\nMan charged after incident on roof of Leicester flat\n\nComments\n\nSearch for men after woman hospitalised by spiked drink\n\n13 Comments\n\nNew Leicestershire 'healthcare hub' will deal with 'thousands' of patients a\nyear\n\n2 Comments\n\nLeicester street lights stuck on all day due to cyber attack\n\n14 Comments\n\nCrash shuts A50 near Glenfield - live updates\n\nComments\n\nVideo shows armed trio robbing elderly shopkeeper in terrifying 3-minute raid\n\n20 Comments\n\nDeserted Leicester council offices being eyed up for 58 flats\n\n18 Comments\n\nLeicester to get new skatepark near Abbey Park\n\n11 Comments\n\n'Public nuisance' worries over bid for new 24-hour convenience store on\nNarborough Road\n\n7 Comments\n\nMore stolen data released by Leicester City Council cyber hackers in even\nbigger leak\n\n11 Comments\n\nCouncil proposes to borrow another \u00a31m to buy eight more homes for refugees\n\n101 Comments\n\nLeicester adventure playgrounds appeal to city mayor over withdrawal of\nfunding\n\n7 Comments\n\nCity centre offices being eyed up for flats\n\n14 Comments\n\nLeader of Leicester\u2019s Conservative Party returns to Labour fold 18 months\nafter quitting\n\n33 Comments\n\nTruth behind Leicester City\u2019s psychological title stumble as Enzo Maresca\n\u2018process\u2019 analysed\n\n9 Comments\n\nLeicester City have 'new solution' up their sleeve \u2013 but Enzo Maresca doesn't\nneed it yet\n\n14 Comments\n\nHinckley Road travel live updates as collision closes off main route\n\nComments\n\nDog attacks man trying to save his pet from mauling\n\n6 Comments\n\nTime running out to apply for voter ID in the upcoming police and crime\ncommissioner elections\n\n2 Comments\n\n\"It's been going on for quite a while now but the council are unable to switch\nthem off. A lot of people around here have mentioned it. I noticed that down\nAnstey Lane they're all on along one side but off on the other side. It looks\nlike they're going to take a while to sort it out, too.\"\n\nA city council spokesperson said: \u201cWe are aware of a number of streetlights\nthat are staying on during the day. This is due to a technical issue connected\nto the recent cyber attack, when we were forced to shut down our IT systems.\nIt means we are currently not able to remotely identify faults in the street\nlighting system.\n\n\"The default mode for faults is that the lights stay on to ensure that roads\nare not left completely unlit and become a safety concern. \u201cThere are a number\nof steps required to resolve the problem, and we are working through these as\nquickly as we can.\u201d\n\nShare this on\n\nStory Saved\n\nYou can find this story in My Bookmarks.Or by navigating to the user
