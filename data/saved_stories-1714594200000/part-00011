Novet@jordannovet\n\nWATCH LIVE\n\nKey Points\n\n  * Newspaper publishers in California, Colorado, Illinois, Florida, Minnesota and New York said that Microsoft and OpenAI used millions of their articles without payment or permission to develop artificial intelligence models for ChatGPT and other products.\n  * The publishers provided examples of ChatGPT and Microsoft\u2019s Copilot chatbot allegedly regurgitating information from their articles without directing people to newspaper websites.\n\nIn this article\n\n  * MSFT+3.19 (+0.82%)\n\nSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, during a panel session at the World Economic Forum\nin Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 18, 2024.\n\nStefan Wermuth | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nEight U.S. newspaper publishers filed suit against Microsoft and OpenAI in a\nNew York federal court on Tuesday, claiming the technology companies reuse\ntheir articles without permission in generative artificial intelligence\nproducts and incorrectly attribute inaccurate information to them.\n\nThe group of eight newspaper publishers takes issue with ChatGPT and\nMicrosoft\u2019s Copilot assistant \u2014 available in the Windows operating system, the\nBing search engine, and other products the software maker produces. ChatGPT\nand Copilot have been \u201cpurloining millions of the publishers\u2019 copyrighted\narticles without permission and without payment,\u201d according to the complaint,\nwhich had been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of\nNew York.\n\nThe newspaper publishers in the lawsuit operate the New York Daily News, the\nChicago Tribune, the Orlando Sentinel, the Sun Sentinel in Florida, The\nMercury News in California, The Denver Post, The Orange County Register in\nCalifornia and the Pioneer Press of Minnesota. All fall under the ownership of\nhedge fund Alden Global Capital.\n\n\u201cWe take great care in our products and design process to support news\norganizations,\u201d an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWhile we were not\npreviously aware of Alden Global Capital\u2019s concerns, we are actively engaged\nin constructive partnerships and conversations with many news organizations\naround the world to explore opportunities, discuss any concerns, and provide\nsolutions. Along with our news partners, we see immense potential for AI tools\nlike ChatGPT to deepen publishers\u2019 relationships with readers and enhance the\nnews experience.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft declined to comment.\n\nThe newspaper publishers said in the lawsuit that OpenAI has drawn on data\nsets containing text from their newspapers to train its GPT-2 and GPT-3 large\nlanguage models, which can spit out text in response to a few words of human\ninput.\n\n\u201cThe current GPT-4 LLM will output near-verbatim copies of significant\nportions of the publishers\u2019 works when prompted to do so,\u201d the complaint said,\nshowing several examples of ChatGPT and the Copilot allegedly doing so.\n\nThe publishers said Microsoft copies information from their newspapers for the\nBing search index, which helps inform answers in the Copilot. But such output\ndoesn\u2019t always provide links to newspaper websites, where they can view ads\nalongside articles or pay for subscriptions.\n\nThe legal challenge comes four months after The New York Times sued OpenAI\nover copyright infringement in the ChatGPT chatbot that the startup released\nin late 2022. OpenAI said in a January blog post that the case is without\nmerit, adding it wants to support \u201ca healthy news ecosystem.\u201d That same month,\nSam Altman, OpenAI\u2019s CEO, said the startup wanted to pay The New York Times\nand was surprised to learn about the lawsuit.\n\nIn recent months, OpenAI has signed deals with a handful of media companies,\nincluding Axel Springer and the Financial Times, enabling the Microsoft-backed\nstartup to draw on the publishers\u2019 content to improve AI models.\n\nGoogle, which has its own general-purpose chatbot for responding to user\nqueries, said in February that it had reached an agreement with Reddit that\nincludes the right to train AI models on the platform\u2019s content.\n\nThe New York Times case also touched on the matter of OpenAI models\nregurgitating information from its articles. In its blog post, OpenAI\ncharacterized such behavior as \u201ca rare failure of the learning process that we\nare continually making progress on.\u201d\n\nCorrection: This article has been updated to reflect the correct day the\nlawsuit against Microsoft and OpenAI was filed.\n\nWATCH: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman: The U.S. needs an AI policy\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO3:1003:10\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman: the U.S. needs an AI policy\n\nHalftime Report\n\n## More In AI Impact\n\nMicrosoft says cloud AI demand is exceeding supply even after 79% surge in\ncapital spending\n\nJordan Novet\n\nSoftBank will reportedly invest nearly $1 billion in AI push, tapping Nvidia\u2019s\nchips\n\nDylan Butts\n\nLos Angeles is using AI in a pilot program to try to predict homelessness and\nallocate aid\n\nKate Rogers\n\nRead More\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
