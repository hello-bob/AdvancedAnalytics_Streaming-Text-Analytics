Specifically, these are its Advanced Computing, Mission-\nCritical Systems, and Cybersecurity Products.\n\nThe Paris Stock Exchange-listed biz said in an update today that an indicative\nvaluation of the assets pegged them somewhere between \u20ac700 million ($750\nmillion) and \u20ac1 billion ($1.07 billion). A due diligence phase will begin\nshortly in anticipation of a confirmatory non-binding offer by early June.\n\nFrance's Minister of Economics and Finance, Bruno Le Maire, said in an\ninterview with news channel LCI that Atos is involved in IT projects for the\nmilitary and other parts of the state, so the government was keen to ensure\nthese did not fall under the control of foreign-owned entities.\n\n\"I submitted this weekend a letter of intent with a view to acquiring all the\nsovereign activities of Atos,\" Le Maire said, in order to prevent strategic\nactivities from \"passing into the hands of foreign players.\"\n\nIn particular, Atos is the integrator behind supercomputers used for France's\nnuclear deterrent, as well as a key participant in AI and quantum computing\nprojects, and a provider of cybersecurity services.\n\nAtos welcomed the letter of intent, and reiterated that this would protect the\nsovereign strategic imperatives of the French state.\n\nOne French politician called last year for the nationalization of the\n\"sovereign activities\" of the Atos group, but the French finance ministry\ndenied at the time that the government was considering any such move.\n\nLe Maire told LCI he hoped \"the state would not be alone\" and that the\ngovernment's move would rally other \"French sovereign players\" to take a stake\nin the troubled IT giant, saying this could mean companies operating in the\nfields of defense or aeronautics.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, Dassault Aviation, which builds France's\nRafale fighter jets, has previously expressed interest in some Atos assets,\nwhile defence electronics group Thales could be another potential participant.\n\nAirbus confirmed in January that it was in discussions with Atos over the\npurchase of BDS but pulled out in March.\n\nThe French government's letter of intent provides for an exchange of\ninformation and global offers in the context of the group's financial\nrestructuring plan until July 31 or the conclusion of a global restructuring\nagreement.\n\nLast week, Atos said its refinancing proposals had been postponed to May 3 to\nallow stakeholders time to incorporate new information, with July still the\nfinal target date to reach an agreement.\n\nBut in its market update issued today, Atos said it now believes it will need\n\u20ac1.1 billion ($1.2 billion) to fund the business over the 2024-25 period,\ncompared with the \u20ac600 million ($643 million) previously estimated. This is to\nbe met in the form of debt and/or equity from existing stakeholders or third-\nparty investors.\n\nToday's update also revised down its estimated revenue for Atos Group for this\nyear from the \u20ac9.9 billion ($10.6 billion) previously communicated to \u20ac9.8\nbillion ($10.5 billion), representing a decline of about 3.3 percent compared\nwith 2023, the company said.\n\nThe key parameters of its financial restructuring framework are not affected\nby the letter of intent, Atos claimed. If an agreement is reached with the\nFrench state, it does not expect to see the proceeds from the transaction\nbefore the second half of 2025. However, such proceeds would be available for\nearly repayment of potential new money instruments as part of the financial\nrestructuring package, it added.\n\n  * Atos hopes for lifeline as refinancing saga set to drag on into May\n  * Butler Investments joins Atos rescue party\n  * Atos says Airbus flew off, no longer interested in infosec and big data biz\n  * Bank's struggle to replace Atos threw system back to dark ages\n\nIDC's European senior research director for the Enterprise Infrastructure\nunit, Andrew Buss, said it is understandable that the French government, which\nrelies heavily on some key Atos technologies, wants to ensure it can keep it\nunder French control.\n\n\"I would think of this as an early and pre-emptive shot across the bows to\nwarn investors that certain critical Atos technology will not be freely\navailable. It is also worth bearing in mind that the technologies under offer\nhere are a quite minor part of the company's overall business and revenues,\"\nhe said.\n\nOmdia chief analyst Roy Illsley described it as a smart move by the French\ngovernment in light of the adoption of AI and the concept of AI sovereignty.\n\n\"France is 80-90 percent nuclear powered, which means while other nations are\ntrying to identify how they are going to meet the energy demand while shutting\ncarbon-intensive power generation, the French have the power,\" he told The\nRegister. \"So securing the capability to develop the technology and become\nmore self-reliant would not be a bad thing in these uncertain times.\"\n\nHowever this offer from the French state is by no means certain to happen.\n\n\"The expectation is that Atos will successfully manage to refinance to the\nagreement of creditors and stakeholders once the current uncertainties under\nthe management changes work their way out, so this looks like a fallback plan\nto activate as necessary,\" Buss said. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Atos\n  * France\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Atos\n  * France\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * ESA\n  * Paris\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * EMEA\n  * Europe\n  * European Union\n\n#### More about\n\n4 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Atos\n  * France\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Atos\n  * France\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * ESA\n  * Paris\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * EMEA\n  * Europe\n  * European Union\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Atos hopes for lifeline as refinancing saga set to drag on into May\n\nStruggling French tech giant posts disappointing Q1 results\n\nOn-Prem4 days | 5\n\n#### Butler Investments joins Atos rescue party\n\nShares up 25% on the news\n\nSystems21 days | 2\n\n#### French issue alerte rouge after local governments knocked offline by\ncyber attack\n\nEmbarrassing, as its officials are in the US to discuss Olympics cyber threats\n\nSecurity17 days | 9\n\n#### Java thriving after 30 years\n\nWhy OpenJDK is as important as ever in the big picture of IT\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### French lawmakers take a swing at cloud monopolies\n\nAction gathers steam in the EU, US and UK as anti-trust teams collate market\nfeedback\n\nPaaS + IaaS27 days | 6\n\n#### Atos says Airbus flew off, no longer interested in infosec and big data\nbiz\n\nAiling tech integrator takes a hard hit... share price down by up to 20% this\nmorning\n\nSecurity1 month | 13\n\n#### Why France this week fined Google \u20ac250M over web news\n\nGoogle pulls a few coins from the sofa and says whatever, just clarify who\nneeds to be paid for what\n\nPersonal Tech1 month | 11\n\n#### Record breach of French government exposes up to 43 million people's data\n\nZut alors!
