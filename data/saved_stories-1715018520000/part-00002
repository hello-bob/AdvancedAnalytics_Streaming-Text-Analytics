Abrams asked\nJuul officials for talking points, allowed company executives to review an\nacademic article prior to publishing, and attended Juul scientific advisory\nboard meetings, all without disclosing those connections to journal publishers\nor the public.\n\nSTAT+ Exclusive Story\n\nAlready have an account?
