In\naddition, you can find a complete list of available options in the Configuring\nDocs. The config can also be edited and saved directly through the UI.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Back to Top\n\n## Theming \ud83c\udfa8\n\n> For full theming documentation, see: Theming\n\nDashy comes pre-bundled with several built-in themes, which you can preview,\napply and edit through the UI. With the theme configurator and support for\ncustom CSS, everything is in place to quickly develop your own unique-looking\ndashboard.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Back to Top\n\n## Icons \ud83e\uddf8\n\n> For full iconography documentation, see: Icons\n\nBoth sections and items can have an icon associated with them, defined under\nthe icon attribute. With several different icon packs supported, you'll be\nable to find the perfect thumbnail for any app or service.\n\nThe following icon types are supported:\n\n  * Favicon - Automatically fetch an apps icon from its Favicon or logo image\n  * Icon Packs - Use any icon from font-awesome, simple-icons or material icons\n  * Emoji - Any valid emoji can be used as an icon\n  * Generative - Unique, auto-generated images for easily identifying services\n  * URL - Pass the URL of any valid image in to have it fetched and rendered\n  * Local - Store custom images locally and reference by filename\n  * Homelab Icons - Using dashboard-icons for logos of commonly self-hosted services\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Back to Top\n\n## Status Indicators \ud83d\udea6\n\n> For full monitoring documentation, see: Status Indicators\n\nDashy has an optional feature to check if each app/ service is up and\nresponding, then display a small status indicator icon. Hovering over it will\nshow additional stats like response time and status code.\n\nStatus indicators can be globally enabled by setting appConfig.statusCheck:\ntrue or enabled/ disabled on a per-item basis. Status is checked on page load,\nbut you can allow continuous polling by specifying a time interval between\nchecks, in seconds under appConfig.statusCheckInterval. You can also use a\ndifferent endpoint for status checking, with statusCheckUrl, and if needed,\npass in custom headers under statusCheckHeaders.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Back to Top\n\n## Widgets \ud83d\udcca\n\n> For full widget documentation, see: Widgets\n\nYou can display dynamic content from services in the form of widgets. There\nare several pre-built widgets availible for showing useful info, and\nintegrations with commonly self-hosted services, but you can also easily\ncreate your own for almost any app.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Back to Top\n\n## Authentication \ud83d\udd10\n\n> For full authentication documentation, see: Authentication\n\nDashy has full support for secure single-sign-on using Keycloak for secure,\neasy authentication, see setup docs for a full usage guide.\n\nThere is also a basic auth feature, which doesn't require additional setup. To\nenable this, add an auth attribute under appConfig, containing an array of\nusers, each with a username, SHA-256 hashed password and optional user type.\nBasic auth also supports several access control features, including read-only\nguest access and granular controls.\n\n    \n    \n    appConfig: auth: users: - user: alicia hash: 4D1E58C90B3B94BCAD9848ECCACD6D2A8C9FBC5CA913304BBA5CDEAB36FEEFA3 type: admin\n\nOther access control systems are also supported, see the Alternative Auth\nMethods docs.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Back to Top\n\n## Alternate Views \ud83d\udc53\n\nAs well as the default homepage, there is also:\n\n  * A minimal view, valid for use as a browser start page\n  * A workspace view, useful for visiting many apps simultaneously\n\nYou can change the view from the UI, using the switch icon in the top-right\ncorner, or select a default view in the config under appConfig.startingView\nattribute.\n\nExample of Workspace View\n\nExample of Minimal View\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Back to Top\n\n## Opening Methods \ud83d\uddb1\ufe0f\n\n> For full documentation on views and opening methods, see: Alternate Views\n\nThere are several different ways you can launch apps. You can specify the\ndefault opening method for any given item under the target attribute or set a\nsite-wide default under appConfig.defaultOpeningMethod. Right-click on an item\nto item for all options. The following options are supported:\n\n  * sametab - The app will be launched in the current tab\n  * newtab - The app will be launched in a new tab (or use Ctrl + Click)\n  * modal - Launch app in a resizable/ movable popup modal on the current page (or use Alt + Click)\n  * workspace - Changes to Workspace view and launches app\n  * clipboard - Copy the app's URL to your system clipboard\n  * top - Opens in the top-most browsing context, useful if you're accessing Dashy through an iframe\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Back to Top\n\n## Searching and Shortcuts \ud83d\udd0e\n\n> For full documentation on searching, see: Searching & Shortcuts\n\nQuickly finding and launching applications is the primary aim of Dashy. To\nthat end, instant search and customizable keyboard shortcuts are built-in.\n\nTo start filtering, start typing\u2014no need to select the search bar or use any\nspecial key. Then use either the tab key or arrow keys to select and move\nbetween results, and hit enter to launch the currently selected application.\n\nFor apps that you use regularly, you can set a custom keybinding. Use the\nhotkey parameter on a certain item to specify a numeric key between 0 - 9. You\ncan then launch that app by just pressing that key.\n\nYou can also add custom tags to a given item to make finding them based on\nkeywords easier. For example, in the following example, searching for 'Movies'\nwill show 'Plex'\n\n    \n    \n    items: - title: Plex hotkey: 8 icon: favicon description: Media library url: https://plex.lab.local tags: [ movies, videos, music ]\n\nTo search the web directly through Dashy, just press enter after typing your\nquery. Options for web search are set under appConfig.webSearch. There is\nbuilt-in support for 10+ search engines, or use your own custom provider or\nself-hosted instance. With the web search, you can also define your bangs to\nredirect results to any given app, website, or search engine, when the query\nis preceded with a certain character sequence (usually beginning in /, ! or\n:).\n\n    \n    \n    webSearch: searchEngine: duckduckgo openingMethod: newtab searchBangs: /r: reddit /w: wikipedia /s: https://whoogle.local/search?q= ':wolf': wolframalpha ':so': stackoverflow ':git': github\n\nHit Esc at any time to close any open apps, clear the search field, or hide\nany modals.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Back to Top\n\n## Config Editor \u2699\ufe0f\n\n> For full config documentation, see: Configuring\n\nAs well as passing in a YAML config file, you can also configure the app\ndirectly through the UI and preview changes live.\n\nTo edit any section or item, right-click on it, and select \"Edit\", or enter\nthe Edit Mode (using the Pen icon in the top-right), then click any part of\nthe page to edit. Changes will be visible immediately but will not be saved\nuntil clicking \"Save to Disk\" or \"Save Locally\".\n\nUnder the config menu, you can export, view, backup, or reset app config and\nedit the raw config file in a text editor with built-in schema validation.\nIt's recommended to keep a backup of your config.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Back to Top\n\n## Cloud Backup & Sync \u2601\n\n> For full backup documentation, see: Cloud Backup & Sync\n\nDashy has an optional built-in feature for securely backing up your config to\na hosted cloud service and then restoring it on another instance. This is\nuseful not only for backing up your configuration off-site but also enables\nDashy to be used without having to write a YAML config file.\n\nAll data is fully E2E encrypted before being sent to the backend (done in\nCloudBackup.js using crypto.js 's AES method). The data is then sent to a\nCloudflare worker and stored in a KV data store.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Back to Top\n\n## Language Switching \ud83c\udf0e\n\n> For full internationalization documentation, see: Multi-Language Support\n\nDashy supports multiple languages and locales. When available, your language\nshould be automatically detected and applied on load. But you can also select\na language through the UI (under config --> Switch Language) or set\nappConfig.language to your language (specified as a 2-digit ISO 639-1 code),\nas seen below, e.g. language: de.\n\n#### Supported Languages\n\n  * \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 English: en - Default\n  * \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddea Arabic: ar - Auto-generated\n  * \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\udde9 Bengali: bn - Contributed by @soaibsafi\n  * \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddec Bulgarian: bg - Contributed by @asenov\n  * \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3 Chinese: cn - Contributed by @FormatToday\n  * \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddff Czech: cs - Contributed by @Tuzi555\n  * \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddf0 Danish: da - Contributed by @lordpansar\n  * \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddf1 Dutch: nl - Contributed by @evroon\n  * \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7 French: fr - Contributed by @EVOTk\n  * \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea German: de - Contributed by @Niklashere\n  * \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\uddf7 Greek: el - Contributed by @aviolaris\n  * \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3 Hindi: hi - Auto-generated\n  * \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9 Italian: it - Contributed by @alexdelprete\n  * \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5 Japanese: ja - Auto-generated\n  * \ud83c\uddf0\ud83c\uddf7 Korean: ko - Contributed by @boggy-cs\n  * \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddf4 Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l: nb - Contributed by @rubjo\n  * \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf1 Polish: pl - Contributed by @skaarj1989\n  * \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf9 Portuguese: pt - Contributed by @LeoColman\n  * \ud83d\udef0\ufe0f Galician: gl - Contributed by @pvillaverde\n  * \ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa Russian: ru - Auto-generated\n  * \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddf0 Slovak: sk - Contributed by @Smexhy\n  * \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddee Slovenian: sl - Contributed by @UrekD\n  * \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 Spanish: es - Contributed by @lu4t\n  * \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddea Swedish: sv - Contributed by @BOZG\n  * \ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddfc Traditional Chinese: zh-TW - Contributed by @stanly0726\n  * \ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddf7 Turkish: tr - Contributed by @imsakg\n  * \ud83c\udff4\u2620\ufe0f Pirate: pirate - Contributed by @Lissy93\n\n#### Add your Language\n\nI would love Dashy to be available to everyone without language being a\nbarrier to entry. If you've got a few minutes to spare, consider adding\ntranslations for your language. It's a quick task, and all text is in a single\nJSON file. Since any missing text will fall back to English, you don't need to\ntranslate it all.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Back to Top\n\n## Multi-Page Support \ud83d\udcc3\n\n> For full multi-page documentation, see: Pages & Sections\n\nWithin your dashboard, you can have as many sub-pages as you require. To load\nadditional pages, specify a name, and path to a config file under pages. The\nconfig file can be either local (stored in /public), or remote (located\nanywhere accessible).\n\n    \n    \n    pages: - name: Networking Services path: 'networking.yml' - name: Work Stuff path: 'work.yml'\n\nOr\n\n    \n    \n    pages: - name: Getting Started path: 'https://snippet.host/tvcw/raw' - name: Homelab path: 'https://snippet.host/tetp/raw' - name: Browser Startpage path: 'https://snippet.host/zcom/raw'\n\n## System Requirements \ud83d\udcca\n\nIf running on bare metal, Dashy requires Node V 16.0.0 or later, LTS (16.13.2)\nis recommended.\n\nIf running in Docker container, the recommended base image is Alpine (3.15)\n\nThe hardware requirements vary depending on where and how you are running\nDashy. Generally speaking, on a bare-metal system or Docker container, 1GB of\nmemory should be more than enough, and depending on whether you are using your\nown assets, then 1GB of disk space should be sufficient.\n\nIf you are using one of the 1-click cloud deployment methods, serving the app\nthrough a CDN or using a static hosting provider, then there are no specific\nrequirements, as the built app is just a series of static JS files, and so is\nvery light-weight.\n\nDashy also wells run on low-powered ARM-based single board computers, such as\na Raspberry Pi (tested on Pi 3)\n\nBrowser Support\n\nLatest \u2714| Latest \u2714| 10+ \u2714| Latest \u2714| 6.1+ \u274c  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n  \n\u2b06\ufe0f Back to Top\n\n## Support \ud83d\ude4b\u2640\ufe0f\n\nIf you're having trouble getting Dashy up and running, or have a question\nabout usage or configuration, feel free to ask. The best place to do this is\nvia the Discussions.\n\nIf you've found something which isn't working as it should, please raise a bug\nby opening a ticket.\n\nIt's best to check the docs, previous issues and troubleshooting guide first.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Back to Top\n\n## Supporting Dashy \ud83d\udc96\n\n> For full details and other ways you can help out, see: Contributing\n\nIf you're using Dashy and would like to help support its development, then\nthat would be awesome!
