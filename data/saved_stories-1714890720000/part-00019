However, arrays in these, and almost all prominent systems, can\n> only handle dense rectilinear integer grids. Real world arrays often contain\n> underlying structure, such as sparsity, runs of repeated values, or\n> symmetry. Support for structured data is fragmented and incomplete. Existing\n> frameworks limit the array structures and program control flow they support\n> to better simplify the problem. In this work, we propose a new programming\n> language, Finch, which supports both flexible control flow and diverse data\n> structures. Finch facilitates a programming model which resolves the\n> challenges of computing over structured arrays by combining control flow and\n> data structures into a common representation where they can be co-optimized.\n> Finch automatically specializes control flow to data so that performance\n> engineers can focus on experimenting with many algorithms. Finch supports a\n> familiar programming language of loops, statements, ifs, breaks, etc., over\n> a wide variety of array structures, such as sparsity, run-length-encoding,\n> symmetry, triangles, padding, or blocks. Finch reliably utilizes the key\n> properties of structure, such as structural zeros, repeated values, or\n> clustered non-zeros. We show that this leads to dramatic speedups in\n> operations such as SpMV and SpGEMM, image processing, graph analytics, and a\n> high-level tensor operator fusion interface.\n\nSubjects:| Mathematical Software (cs.MS)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.16730 [cs.MS]  \n(or arXiv:2404.16730v1 [cs.MS] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.16730arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Willow Ahrens [view email] [v1] Thu, 25 Apr 2024 16:41:12 UTC (3,824 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Finch: Sparse and Structured Array Programming\nwith Control Flow, by Willow Ahrens and 5 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.MS\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
