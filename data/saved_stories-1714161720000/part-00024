In fact, in The Brain Abstracted, an avowedly \u201copinionated\u201d\nhistory of neuroscience, M. Chirimuuta argues that, due to the brain's\ncomplexity, neuroscientific theories have only captured partial truths\u2014and\n\u201cneurophilosophy\u201d is unlikely to be achieved. Looking at the theory and\npractice of neuroscience, both past and present, Chirimuuta shows how the\nscience has been shaped by the problem of brain complexity and the need, in\nscience, to make things as simple as possible. From this history, Chirimuuta\ndraws lessons for debates in philosophy of science over the limits and\ndefinition of science and in philosophy of mind over explanations of\nconsciousness and the mind-body problem.\n\nThe Brain Abstracted is the product of a historical rupture that has become\nvisible in the twenty-first century, between the \u201cclassical\u201d scientific\napproach, which seeks simple, intelligible principles underlying the manifest\ncomplexity of nature, and a data-driven engineering approach, which dispenses\nwith the search for elegant, explanatory laws and models. In the space created\nby this rupture, Chirimuuta finds grounds for theoretical and practical\nhumility. Her aim in The Brain Abstracted is not to reform neuroscience, or\noffer advice to neuroscientists, but rather to interpret their work\u2014and to\nsuggest a new framework for interpreting the philosophical significance of\nneuroscience.\n\n## Author(s)\n\nOriginally trained in visual neuroscience, M. Chirimuuta writes on the central\nideas of the mind/brain sciences. She is Senior Lecturer in Philosophy at the\nUniversity of Edinburgh and the author of Outside Color (MIT Press).\n\n## Praise\n\n> \u201cChirimuuta's thoughtful treatment is a salutary reminder that substantive\n> philosophical conclusions can rarely be read off from scientific theories.\n> More challengingly, The Brain Abstracted mounts an unusually scientifically\n> well-informed argument for the autonomy of philosophical inquiries about the\n> mind from the findings of neuroscience.\u201d\n>\n> Nicholas Shea, Professor, Institute of Philosophy, University of London\n\n> \u201cChirimuuta provides a fiercely intelligent and indeed thrilling take down\n> of many of the sins of simplification that dominate current neuroscience.\n> This book is an effortlessly original standout, and it could not be\n> timelier.\u201d\n>\n> John W. Krakauer, John C. Malone Professor, Professor of Neurology and\n> Neuroscience, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine; External\n> Professor, The Santa Fe Institute\n\n## Open Access\n\n##### General info\n\nThe open access edition of this book was made possible by generous funding and\nsupport from MIT Press Direct to Open\n\nDonate to support open access publishing at the MIT Press\n\n##### License Info\n\nCreative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International\nPublic License\n\n##### OA links and downloads\n\nMIT Press Direct open access edition\n\n## Related Books\n\nConnect\n\n\u00a9 2024 MIT Press.
