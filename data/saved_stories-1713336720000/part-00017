I've\nbeen involved in both web and software development for over 4 years now and\nworked with many front-end and back-end frameworks.\n\nNew Twitter UI  \n---  \n  \nBefore all of the UI designers that read this go out and riot and champion\nagainst me for saying UI redesigns are a waste of time, let me say that I do\nvalue design. I think at the bare minimum, a product or website needs to be\nusable, and if you possess a good eye and steady hand, you should feel\ncompelled to create something that looks pleasing.\n\nDavid  \n---  \n  \nJust stop redesigning the UI all the time.\n\nUI redesigns, in my opinion, are a waste of time 95% of the time. Let me\nexplain further.\n\n## No one cares\n\nCome see our fresh new look! What about our new material design, come see! I'm\nsorry, but besides fixing the UI where it impacts the usability of your\napplication, no one is raving about how a redesign makes the application any\nbetter.\n\nPeople use applications because of their purpose, not because it is pleasing\nto the eye.\n\nYou don't use Google maps because it looks nice, you use it because it tells\nyou where to go to get good tacos. You don't use Facebook because the UI is\nnice, you use it to talk to your friends and share photos. You don't shop on\ngamestop.com because you like navigating the mess of drop downs and\nadvertisements, you shop because you want to pick up Anthem.\n\nA little much, eh?  \n---  \n  \nThe only time a UI should be updated is if it impacts the ability of a user to\nactually use your application.\n\nIf you find users aren't able to navigate to page x because it's hidden in the\nmenu, by all means move the link. Call out the page. Reposition the logout\nbutton so it makes sense to everyone. Be clear how your forms are laid out.\nThis is not a redesign, but good design (and should reflect the needs of the\nbusiness and your users).\n\n## It hurts retention\n\nI loathe every time I need to re-learn a new UI. This is especially when the\nUI redesign gets too ambitious. The fact of the matter folks, is when you\nredesign your UI, it takes extra effort to learn where the updates have been\nmade.\n\nThe people who use your application, don't like change. They like to go on\nautopilot after they've learned something, it's just plain easier for them.\nThe more you change things up, the more effort it requires to use.\n\nThe new redesign of BMO Harris's online portal  \n---  \n  \nNo - that is not my real balance. I'm not rich.\n\nPlease stop changing everything, stop making it more work for us to relearn\nthe applications we like to use.\n\n## It's smoke and mirrors\n\nUpper management loves to hear that you are making \"big changes\" with \"fresh\nnew looks\", it's like being Charlie Bucket and knowing you'll win that big\nprize because now you have that golden ticket.\n\nMy winning ticket  \n---  \n  \nEspecially if your company is public, you have investors throwing money at you\nto turn a profit, which in turn returns the money to them. There is pressure\nto advance, and an easy way to do that is with the word \"redesign\". Everyone\nlikes to hear of that big new design you are rolling out, better marketing,\nsleek logo, easier interface... All of these phrases bring great praise and\npotential dollar signs.\n\nDoes it really add up, or are you just giving designers busywork that doesn't\namount to anything in the end?\n\nDo we have concrete evidence that what we are doing will provide benefit to\nthe company or users, or just feel that it would be better if the UI was\nredesigned? Take a minute, think about that one.\n\n## It contributes to our worse nature\n\nWe are already addicted to that burst of dopamine, something new. Do we really\nneed another redesign or is it something that gives us our temporary fix until\nwe move on to something new?\n\nSometimes, if we are able to do it does not mean we should.\n\nI feel we need to dial-back on our UI redesigns and consider where we actually\nshould be spending our time. Let's tackle something important like tech debt\ninstead.\n\n## Comments\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this issue? I'd be curious to know and hear opinions\nfrom both sides.\n\n  * Get link\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Pinterest\n  * Email\n  * Other Apps\n\n### Labels\n\ndesign ui\n\nLabels: design ui\n\n  * Get link\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Pinterest\n  * Email\n  * Other Apps\n\n### Comments\n\n  1.

However, in a lot of\nsituations the UI redesign accompanies ux improvements as well. In the case of\nmaterial design, all their apps are being standardized with the same visual\nlanguage making it easier to use them all. Definitely always should ask the\nquestion why. UX and improving the user's experience at doing the job they\nneed to do should drive the visual changes.\n\nReplyDelete\n\nReplies\n\n    1.

It needs to have nice transitions between pages and features, it must be\nlogically structured, it must look modern (so the user thinks the developer is\none of the leading devs) and especially UI rewriting often comes with a code\nrevamp, so that's really necessary too for good development. I wrote so much\nmore than this, but, because my page was refreshed for the most silly reason\non Earth (I accidentally pressed the \"home\" button) my writing was deleted.\nAll of it... I had it well structured. Anyways, I rewrote the key reasons for\nyou and, because it's 6am in the morning and I haven't slept I really need to\nfinish my writing now.\n\nKey essence:\n\nUX is more important than UI.\n\nBut without UI revamps UXs cannot increase user retention.\n\nIt's as easy as that :)\n\nDelete\n\nReplies\n\nReply\n\nReply\n\n  3. JonathanMarch 2, 2019 at 3:11 AM\n\nYou're talking mainly about \"site redesigns\" here, not incremental change, so\nI'll address that. Props for stating up front that you're not a UI designer,\nbut it's apparent there are aspects to this that you may not be aware of.\n\nAs a UX designer on a large commercial site, you work with the business via\nthe product management team to determine what's called a \"design strategy\" (or\nare given the task of implementing that, if you're not yourself responsible\nfor creating it). The design strategy is aligned to the business strategy, and\nit determines the information architecture and interaction design of all the\n\"products\" that the customers will be exposed to. Sometimes it includes the\nvisual design, but that's not a really necessary.\n\nIf you get it right, the design strategy then forms a capable platform for the\nforeseeable future (note the word \"foreseeable\"): new features, products and\ntarget markets that are being thought about - many of which may not actually\nhit the UI for months, and often even years. It's like a combination of\nsteering the Titanic and solving a Rubik's Cube where the icebergs slowly move\nand the colours of the cube change over time.\n\nThis work is necessarily difficult, time consuming and never quite finished.\nIt involves having to pick battles, make compromises and do things you don't\nwant to do in order to strike a balance between what the business wants and\nwhat its customers need. Redesigns do have (usually minor) elements of\nbusiness or marketing vanity, and UX designers are very aware of that. If you\ntalk to most designers they will agree with a lot of your points about feature\nfatigue and usability, for example. But their work is a product of navigating\nthe often complex and contradictory aspects of the business: marketing\npriorities, technical and engineering resource and capability constraints,\npolitics and third parties, and other behind-the-scenes stuff. Only then can\nUX apply the craft that they are ostensibly paid to do.\n\nBe that as it may, in quite a few cases there is no design strategy because\nnobody is capable of creating or maintaining one. In which case you will\nobserve the Titanic slowly hitting the iceberg. But that is rare in my\nexperience. At any one time, most sites are simply in a state of sub-optimised\nUX, even with the most capable design team in place. Because the process of\ndesign is hard.\n\nI do not in any way mean this as a criticism of you in writing this post. Your\npoints are, on their face, good ones well made. But the detailed and usually\nvery business-specific reasons behind redesigns are something that, if I'm\nhonest, I don't have time to explain to everyone in the business all the time.\nThis will be true of most large businesses similar to the ones you cite. And\nit is an unfortunate fact that the engineering department is not a good\nvantage point from which to understand these things.\n\nSo I'm not surprised you have written this post. I can only apologise on\nbehalf of my discipline for what is of course a failure of communication.\nPerhaps on the basis of my comment here, more engineers should be asking UX\ndesigners why things are as they are. I'm sure they will be happy to explain.\nBut if they can't, you may be aboard the Titanic.\n\nReplyDelete\n\nReplies\n\n    1. ZacharyMarch 2, 2019 at 10:42 PM\n\nThank you for taking your time and explaining, in-detail, more of what a UX\ndesigner's role is.\n\nI admire your work, and completely understand the complexities of managing the\never-changing business requirements, resources, dependencies and the like.\n\nPerhaps I am not exposed as much as others to the field of UX, but in my\nexperience, the UI redesigns I have been aware of have been more on the basis\nof \"feeling\" without any substantial goal or fact to back them up, and that\nhas made this article bias to that point. I completely agree in favor of\nmaking changes to the UX, however my stance against redesigns are one based on\npure emotion alone.\n\nDelete\n\nReplies\n\nReply\n\nReply\n\n  4.

Now they are removing useful features, slowing down apps\nby reducing distinguishing elements like color, shading, and good use of\nspace. And becoming bland, slow and painful to use quickly. There are plenty\nof studies that show flat design is 25% slower to use, yet everyone continues\nto push for it.

Quite why that is the case is hard to say, but there are still a\nlot of people who call themselves UX designers yet do not know about HCI and\ninteraction design as researched and codified by the likes of Raskin, Cooper,\nNorman, Tog, and others. I have almost given up asking candidates in job\ninterviews questions like \"What is usability?\" or \"What is Fitt's Law\"?\nbecause I never get correct replies, and when I explain them, they seem too\ntheoretical.

As someone said up there, I was also waiting for the data. Every\nredesign comes with improvements, at least in the sense of perceived value by\nthe customer (nicer looks give a sense of seriousness and reliability). Other\ntimes it comes with a big chunk of tech debt being removed from the codebase.\nOthers, a few building blocks will be introduced ie. a pattern library (which\nmakes future development easier, less prone to error).\n\nHaving worked on many UI redesigns over the last years, I feel the things you\nstate in this article are very detached from reality.\n\nReplyDelete\n\nReplies\n\n    1.

Kham It is no longer news\nthat the Acquired immune deficiency syndrome Herpes Virus is increasing by the\nday, The fear is that many people living with the sickness are scared of\nsaying it because of the stigma that comes along with it.I am bold enough\namong many others to state that there is now a potent cure to this sickness\nbut many are unaware of it.I discovered that I was infected with the virus 3\nmonths ago, after a medical check-up. My doctor told me and I was shocked,\nconfused and felt like my world has crumbled. I was dying slowly due to the\nannouncement of my medical practitioner but he assured me that I could leave a\nnormal life if I took my medications, In a bid to look for a lasting solution\nto my predicament, I sought for solutions from the voodoo world. I went online\nand searched for every powerful trado-medical practitioner that I could\nsevere, because I heard that the African Voodoo Priests had a cure to the\nHerpes syndrome. It was after a little time searching the web that I came\nacross one Dr. Kham website who offered to help me, He gave me some steps to\nfollow and I meticulously carried out all his instructions. Two days ago to be\nprecise, I went back to the hospital to conduct another test and to my\namazement, the results showed that \" I am NEGATIVE\" You can free yourself of\nthis Herpes virus by consulting this great African Voodoo Priest via this\nEMAIL [dr.khamcaregiver@gmail.com or dr.khamcaregiver@outlook.com] WHATASPP\nNUMBER +2348159922297 HE CONFIDENTLY TOLD ME HE CAN ALSO SOLVE THE FOLLOWING\nPROBLEMS WITH ANY DELAY IN TIME PREGNANCY spell EPILEPSY cure spell GENPILENCI\nHIV AIDS.

I\nwas hurt and depressed so I was too curious and wanted to try DR. Aza then i\ncontacted him through his email, he assured me 100% that he will heal me, i\npleaded with him to help me out. My experience with him was great, he healed\nme just as he promised. he sent me his medication and ask me to go for a\nmedical check up after two weeks of usage. i agreed with him i took this\nmedication and went for a check up, to my greatest surprise my result was\nnegative, i am really happy that i am cured and healthy again. I have waited\nfor 3weeks to be very sure i was completely healed before writing this\ntestimony.

Herpes is a\nviral infection cause by the Herpes simplex virus, marked by painful, watery\nblister in the skin or mucous membrane or on the genitals. This was what I\nsuffered for good four years. I have visited CVS Pharmacy in Fresno for\ntreatment but no improvement. I meet Dr. JOE online while I was searching for\nherpes cure I read a testimony about his work. I give a try that now becomes a\ntestimony in my life. I contacted Dr. JOE via his E-mail drjoehome@gmail.com\nand he did not responds to me in time and I went back to the same testimony\nfor his mobile number and I called him immediately +2348155730398 and he\nrespond to my call. He welcome me as a daughter and I explain my four years\nsituation to him and he said is done just as I have contacted him and I\nbelieved in him. Dr. JOE sends me some herbal medication for herpes cure and\nhe gave me instruction on what to do and I obeyed his instruction. Changes\nstarted after three days of applying the herbal medication. I went to the same\nCVS Pharmacy in Fresno for test and i was herpes negative. I do not know how\nto thanks Dr. JOE for saving my life. To God be the Glory, I am living healthy\nwith my family today.\n\nIndeed, Dr. JOE is a great man\n\nand the only thing he requested from me is to share my Testimony for the world\nto see for a safe living from herpes viral disease and just as I did. or\ndrjoehome@gmail.com\n\nGod bless Dr. JOE for his good work...\n\nReplyDelete\n\nReplies\n\nReply\n\n  132.

I\nwas hurt and depressed so I was too curious and wanted to try DR. Aza then i\ncontacted him through his email, he assured me 100% that he will heal me, i\npleaded with him to help me out. My experience with him was great, he healed\nme just as he promised. he sent me his medication and ask me to go for a\nmedical check up after two weeks of usage. i agreed with him i took this\nmedication and went for a check up, to my greatest surprise my result was\nnegative, i am really happy that i am cured and healthy again. I have waited\nfor 3weeks to be very sure i was completely healed before writing this\ntestimony. I did another blood test one week ago and it was still Herpes\nnegative. so i guess its time i recommend anyone going through the same way.\nreach him through his email address: drazaherbalcenter@gmail.com OR call, add\nhim on Whatsapp +1(315) 795 1518\n\nReplyDelete\n\nReplies\n\nReply\n\n  167. xevensolutionsDecember 27, 2019 at 1:47 AM\n\ndon't worry about your health your all health problem's solutions is here find\nexpert doctor online in lahore\n\nReplyDelete\n\nReplies\n\nReply\n\n  168. sherry raysDecember 27, 2019 at 2:10 PM\n\nHOW I GOT MY EX LOVER BACK WITH THE HELP OF A REAL AND GENUINE LOVE SPELL\nCASTER DR OJOKA.

Sorry command prompt I really don't do a lot of work in the shell,\nbut I do like to play with low-level interfaces from time to time. The article\nis about Linux shells, but goes into good explanation about what a shell is if\nyou don't know. Log into a website Today, I wanted to do something that I have\nnever really tried before and that is logging into a website using Powershell\n. The concepts behind this are quite simple really, as Powershell has support\nto send HTTP requests and that's usually all we need, unless the server has\nCSRF protections in place (which it should). We are going to attempt to log in\nto my favorite website for buying socks, Absolute Socks : Is that a turkey?!\nIn order to do that, we need to have a login.
