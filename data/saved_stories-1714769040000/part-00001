By paying billions for default\nplacements that the government has argued allowed Google to hoard traffic and\nprofits, Google allegedly made it nearly impossible for rivals to secure\nenough traffic to compete, ultimately decreasing competition and innovation in\nsearch by limiting the number of viable search engines in the market.\n\nThe DOJ's lead litigator, Kenneth Dintzer, told Mehta that what Google should\nhave done was acknowledge that the search giant had an enormous market share\nand consider its duties more carefully under antitrust law. Instead, Dintzer\nalleged, Google chose the route of \"hiding\" and \"destroying documents\" because\nit was aware of conflicts with antitrust law.\n\n\"What should Google have done?\" Dintzer told Mehta. \"They should have\nrecognized that by demanding locking down every default that they were opening\nthemselves up to a challenge on the conduct.\"\n\nThe most controversial default agreement that Google has made is a 21-year\ndeal with Apple that Mehta has described as the \"heart\" of the government's\ncase against Google. During the trial, a witness accidentally blurted out\nGoogle's carefully guarded secret of just how highly it values the Apple deal,\nrevealing that Google pays 36 percent of its search advertising revenue from\nSafari just to remain the default search tool in Apple's browser. In 2022\nalone, trial documents revealed that Google paid Apple $20 billion for the\ndeal, Bloomberg reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat's in stark contrast to the 12 percent of revenue that Android\nmanufacturers get from their default deals with Google. The government wants\nthe court to consider all these default deals to be anti-competitive, with\nDintzer suggesting during closing arguments that they are the \"centerpiece\" of\n\"a lot\" of Google's exclusionary behavior that ultimately allowed Google to\nbecome the best search engine today\u2014by \"capturing the default and preventing\nrivals from getting access to those defaults.\"\n\nGoogle's lawyers have argued that Google succeeds on its merits. Today, lead\nlitigator John Schmidtlein repeatedly pointed out that antitrust law is\ndesigned to protect the competitive process, not specific competitors who fail\nto invest and innovate\u2014as Microsoft did by failing to recognize how crucial\nmobile search would become.\n\n\"Merely getting advantages by winning on quality, they may have an effect on a\nrival, but the question is, does it have an anti-competitive effect?\"\nSchmidtlein argued, noting that the DOJ hadn't \"shown that absent the\nagreements, Microsoft would have toppled Google.\"\n\nBut Dintzer argued that \"a mistake by one rival doesn't mean that Google gets\nto monopolize this market forever.\" When asked to explain why\neveryone\u2014including some of Google's rivals\u2014testified that Google won contracts\npurely because it was the best search engine, Dintzer warned Mehta that the\nfact that Google's rivals \"may be happy cashing Google's checks doesn't tell\nus anything.\"\n\nAccording to Schmidtlein, Google could have crossed the line with the Apple\ndeal, but it didn't.\n\n\"Google didn't go on to say to Apple, if you don't make us the default, no\nGoogle search on Apple devices at all,\" Schmidtlein argued. \"That would be\nsuicide for Google.\"\n\nIt's still unclear how Mehta may be leaning in this case, interrogating both\nsides with care and making it clear that he expects all his biggest questions\nto be answered after closing arguments conclude Friday evening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Mehta did suggest at one point today that it seemed potentially\n\"impossible\" for anyone to compete with Google for default placements.\n\n\"How would anybody be able to spend billions and billions of dollars to\npossibly dislodge Google?\" Mehta asked. \"Is there any real competition for the\ndefault spot?\"\n\nAccording to Schmidtlein, that is precisely what \"competition on the merits\"\nlooks like.\n\n\"Google is winning because it's better, and Apple is deciding Google is better\nfor users,\" Schmidtlein argued. \"The antitrust laws are not designed to ensure\na competitive market. They're designed to ensure a competitive process.\"\n\nProving the potential anti-competitive effects of Google's default agreements,\nparticularly the Apple deal, has long been regarded as the most critical point\nin order to win the government's case. So it's no surprise that the attorney\nrepresenting state attorneys general, Bill Cavanaugh, praised Mehta for\nasking, \"What should Google have done?\" According to Cavanaugh, that was the\n\"right question\" to pose in this trial.\n\n\"What should they have done 10 years ago when there was a recognition\" that\n\"we're monopolists\" and \"we have substantial control in markets\" is ask, \"How\nshould we proceed with our contracts?\" Cavanaugh argued. \"That's the question\nthat they answered, but they answered it in the wrong way.\"\n\nSeemingly if Google's default contracts posed fewer exclusionary concerns, the\ngovernment seems to be arguing, there would be more competition and therefore\nmore investment and innovation in search. But as long as Google controls the\ngeneral search market, the government alleged that users won't be able to\nsearch the web the way that they want.\n\nGoogle is hoping that Mehta will reject the government's theories and instead\nrule that Google has done nothing to stop rivals from improving the search\nlandscape. Early in the day, Mehta told the DOJ that he was \"struggling to\nsee\" how Google has either stopped innovating or degraded its search engine as\na result of lack of competition.\n\nClosing arguments continue on Friday. Mehta is not expected to rule until late\nsummer or early fall.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### What Happens to the Developers When AI Can Code? | Ars Frontiers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n95\n\nAshley Belanger Ashley is a senior policy reporter for Ars Technica, dedicated\nto tracking social impacts of emerging policies and new technologies.
