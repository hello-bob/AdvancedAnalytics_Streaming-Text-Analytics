This foundation\nwill deliver unmatched combat capability per dollar by lowering the barriers\nto entry for industry and allowing continuous hardware and software innovation\nin acquisition, fielding and sustainment of critical mission systems. To fast\ntrack this game-changing capability, the Department of the Air Force\ndesignated Skyborg as one of three initial Vanguard programs in 2019. These\npriority initiatives integrate several technology components across multiple\ndomains to create complex, multidisciplinary solutions. Marked by an\nenterprise-wide commitment, Vanguards deliver advanced capabilities that\ntransform future operations with cutting-edge technologies. As autonomy\ntechnology matures, Skyborg will bring cutting-edge capabilities to the fight\nat a faster pace and lower cost.\n\nHOW DOES THE TECHNOLOGY WORK?\n\nMilitary pilots receive key information about their surroundings when teamed\naircraft with integrated autonomy detect potential air and ground threats,\ndetermine threat proximity, analyze imminent danger, and identify suitable\noptions for striking or evading enemy aircraft. Embedded within the teamed\naircraft, complex algorithms and cutting-edge sensors enable the autonomy to\nmake decisions based on established rules of engagement set by manned\nteammates. Field tests will ensure the algorithms\u2019 accuracy and verify that\nthe system continuously operates within the constraints established during\nmission planning. Skyborg will not replace human pilots. Instead, it will\nprovide them with key data to support rapid, informed decisions. In this\nmanner, Skyborg will provide manned teammates with greater situational\nawareness and survivability during combat missions.\n\nA Skyborg conceptual design for a low cost Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle\n(UCAV). (Artwork courtesy of AFRL)\n\nHOW IS THE AIR FORCE USING THIS TECHNOLOGY?\n\nSkyborg has established an open approach to autonomy architecture, building a\nsystem that is portable across aircraft platforms, modular in its design to\nenable composition of multiple software applications, and adaptable to new\ncapabilities and mission types. The Skyborg approach builds on a foundation of\nresearch and development across the DoD to build a scalable autonomy core\narchitecture. Through a rapid experimentation campaign, the Skyborg system has\nbeen adapted for flight on mission-relevant aircraft and demonstrated initial\ncapability to build warfighter trust and discover capability gaps in\nautonomous systems. The Skyborg Vanguard is a fully integrated team of AFRL\nand Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) personnel to bridge the\ngap between development and acquisition.\n\nForming these working relationships early will foster a seamless transition of\nproducts and knowledge as the Vanguard progress into an acquisition program.\n\nWHY IS SKYBORG IMPORTANT TO THE AIR FORCE?\n\nAutonomous systems can significantly increase capability and be a force\nmultiplier for the U.S. Air Force. By emphasizing future scalability through a\nportable, modular, and adaptable autonomy system, Skyborg represents a\ntransformational way for the U.S. to prepare for potential engagements with\nnear peer adversaries.\n\nFACT SHEET\n\nRead Related Article\n\nTHE AIR FORCE RESEARCH LABORATORY\n\n  * Home\n  * Technology\n  * Partner\n  * Careers\n  * About\n  * News\n  * Events\n  * Terms\n  * Sitemap\n\n  * Air Force Research Lab Facebook Page\n\n  * Air Force Research Lab Twitter page\n\n  * Air Force Research Lab LinkedIn Page\n\n  * Air Force Research Lab Instagram Page\n\n  * Air Force Research Lab Youtube Page\n\n  * Air Force Research Lab Spotify Podcast Page\n\nMedia Inquiries afrl.pa.inquiry@us.af.mil\n\nBusiness Inquiries afrl.sb.questions@us.af.mil\n\nHigher Education Inquiries collaborate@us.af.mil\n\n\u00a9 2024 Air Force Research Laboratory - All Rights Reserved.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
