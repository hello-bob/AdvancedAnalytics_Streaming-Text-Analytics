The extraction of sugar cane juice from the sugarcane plant, and the subsequent domestication of the plant in tropical India and Southeast Asia sometime around 4,000 BC.\n  2. The invention of manufacture of cane sugar granules from sugarcane juice in India a little over two thousand years ago, followed by improvements in refining the crystal granules in India in the early centuries AD.\n  3. The spread of cultivation and manufacture of cane sugar to the medieval Islamic world together with some improvements in production methods.\n  4. The spread of cultivation and manufacture of cane sugar to the West Indies and tropical parts of the Americas beginning in the 16th century, followed by more intensive improvements in production in the 17th through 19th centuries in that part of the world.\n  5. The development of beet sugar, high-fructose corn syrup and other sweeteners in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nSugar was first produced from sugarcane plants in India sometime after the\nfirst century AD.^[1] The derivation of the word \"sugar\" is thought to be from\nSanskrit \u0936\u0930\u094d\u0915\u0930\u093e (\u015barkar\u0101), meaning \"ground or candied sugar,\" originally\n\"grit, gravel\". Sanskrit literature from ancient India, written between 1500\nand 500 BC provides the first documentation of the cultivation of sugar cane\nand of the manufacture of sugar in the Bengal region of the Indian\nsubcontinent.^[2]^[3]\n\nKnown worldwide by the end of the medieval period, sugar was very\nexpensive^[4] and was considered a \"fine spice\",^[5] but from about the year\n1500, technological improvements and New World sources began turning it into a\nmuch cheaper bulk commodity.^[6]\n\n## The spread of sugarcane cultivation[edit]\n\nMap showing centers of origin of Saccharum officinarum in New Guinea, S.\nsinensis in southern China and Taiwan, and S. barberi in India; dotted arrows\nrepresent Austronesian introductions^[7]\n\nThere are two centers of domestication for sugarcane: one for Saccharum\nofficinarum by Papuans in New Guinea and another for Saccharum sinense by\nAustronesians in Taiwan and southern China. Papuans and Austronesians\noriginally primarily used sugarcane as food for domesticated pigs. The spread\nof both S. officinarum and S. sinense is closely linked to the migrations of\nthe Austronesian peoples. Saccharum barberi was only cultivated in India after\nthe introduction of S. officinarum.^[8]^[9]\n\nSaccharum officinarum was first domesticated in New Guinea and the islands\neast of the Wallace Line by Papuans, where it is the modern center of\ndiversity. Beginning at around 6,000 BP they were selectively bred from the\nnative Saccharum robustum. From New Guinea it spread westwards to Island\nSoutheast Asia after contact with Austronesians, where it hybridized with\nSaccharum spontaneum.^[9]\n\nSaccharum officinarum - sugar cane\n\nThe second domestication center is mainland southern China and Taiwan where S.\nsinense was a primary cultigen of the Austronesian peoples. Words for\nsugarcane exist in the Proto-Austronesian languages in Taiwan, reconstructed\nas *t\u0259buS or **CebuS, which became *tebuh in Proto-Malayo-Polynesian. It was\none of the original major crops of the Austronesian peoples from at least\n5,500 BP. Introduction of the sweeter S. officinarum may have gradually\nreplaced it throughout its cultivated range in Island Southeast\nAsia.^[10]^[11]^[7]^[12]^[13]\n\nFrom Island Southeast Asia, S. officinarum was spread eastward into Polynesia\nand Micronesia by Austronesian voyagers as a canoe plant by around 3,500 BP.\nIt was also spread westward and northward by around 3,000 BP to China and\nIndia by Austronesian traders, where it further hybridized with Saccharum\nsinense and Saccharum barberi. From there it spread further into western\nEurasia and the Mediterranean.^[9]^[7]\n\nIndia, where the process of refining cane juice into granulated crystals was\ndeveloped, was often visited by imperial convoys (such as those from China) to\nlearn about cultivation and sugar refining.^[14] By the sixth century AD,\nsugar cultivation and processing had reached Persia . In the Mediterranean,\nsugarcane was possibly brought through the Arab medieval expansion.^[15]\n\"Wherever they went, the medieval Arabs brought with them sugar, the product\nand the technology of its production.\"^[16]\n\nSpanish and Portuguese exploration and conquest in the fifteenth century\ncarried sugar south-west of Iberia. Henry the Navigator introduced cane to\nMadeira in 1425, while the Spanish, having eventually subdued the Canary\nIslands, introduced sugar cane to them.^[15] In 1493, on his second voyage,\nChristopher Columbus carried sugarcane seedlings to the New World, in\nparticular Hispaniola.^[15]\n\n## Early use of sugarcane in India[edit]\n\nSugarcane originated in tropical Indian subcontinent and Southeast\nAsia.^[17]^[18] Different species likely originated in different locations\nwith S. barberi originating in India and S. edule and S. officinarum coming\nfrom New Guinea.^[18] Originally, people chewed sugarcane raw to extract its\nsweetness. Indians discovered how to crystallize sugar during the Gupta\ndynasty, c. 350 AD^[19] although literary evidence from Indian treatises such\nas Arthashastra in the 2nd century AD indicates that refined sugar was already\nbeing produced in India.^[20]\n\nIndian sailors, consumers of clarified butter and sugar, carried sugar by\nvarious trade routes.^[21] Travelling Buddhist monks brought sugar\ncrystallization methods to China.^[22] During the reign of Harsha (r. 606\u2013647)\nin North India, Indian envoys in Tang China taught sugarcane cultivation\nmethods after Emperor Taizong of Tang (r. 626\u2013649) made his interest in sugar\nknown, and China soon established its first sugarcane cultivation in the\nseventh century.^[23] Chinese documents confirm at least two missions to\nIndia, initiated in 647 AD, for obtaining technology for sugar-refining.^[24]\nIn India,^[17] the Iran^[25] ^[26]^[27]and China, sugar became a staple of\ncooking and desserts.\n\nEarly refining methods involved grinding or pounding the cane in order to\nextract the juice, and then boiling down the juice or drying it in the sun to\nyield sugary solids that looked like gravel. The Sanskrit word for \"sugar\"\n(sharkara) also means \"gravel\" or \"sand\".^[28] In Persian: shakar (Traditional\nPersian: \u0634\u06a9\u0631 ) (the root of the world word sugar from Persian shakar,^[29]\nwhich is from Sanskrit \u015barkar\u0101) means sweetening seeds in Farsi.^[30]^[31]\nSimilarly, the Chinese use the term \"gravel sugar\" (Traditional Chinese: \u7802\u7cd6)\nfor what is known in the west as \"table sugar\".\n\nIn 1792, sugar prices soared in Great Britain. On 15 March 1792, his Majesty's\nMinisters to the British parliament presented a report related to the\nproduction of refined sugar in British India. Lieutenant J. Paterson, of the\nBengal Presidency, reported that refined sugar could be produced in India with\nmany superior advantages, and a lot more cheaply than in the West Indies.^[32]\n\n## Cane sugar in the medieval era in the Muslim World and Europe[edit]\n\nThe westward diffusion of sugarcane in pre-Islamic times (shown in red), in\nthe medieval Muslim world (green), and in the 15th century by the Portuguese\non the Madeira archipelago, and by the Spanish on the Canary Islands\narchipelago (islands west of Africa, circled by violet lines)^[33]\n\nThere are records of knowledge of sugar among the ancient Greeks and Romans,\nbut only as an imported medicine, and not as a food. For example, the Greek\nphysician Dioscorides in the 1st century (AD) wrote: \"There is a kind of\ncoalesced honey called sakcharon [i.e. sugar] found in reeds in India and\nEudaimon Arabia [i.e. Yemen^[34]] similar in consistency to salt and brittle\nenough to be broken between the teeth like salt. It is good dissolved in water\nfor the intestines and stomach, and [can be] taken as a drink to help\n[relieve] a painful bladder and kidneys.\"^[35] Pliny the Elder, a 1st-century\n(AD) Roman, also described sugar as medicinal: \"Sugar is made in Arabia as\nwell, but Indian sugar is better. It is a kind of honey found in cane, white\nas gum, and it crunches between the teeth. It comes in lumps the size of a\nhazelnut. Sugar is used only for medical purposes.\"^[36]\n\nDuring the medieval era, Arab entrepreneurs adopted sugar production\ntechniques from India and expanded the industry. Medieval Arabs in some cases\nset up large plantations equipped with on-site sugar mills or refineries. The\ncane sugar plant, which is native to a tropical climate, requires both a lot\nof water and a lot of heat to thrive. The cultivation of the plant spread\nthroughout the medieval Arab world using artificial irrigation. Sugar cane was\nfirst grown extensively in medieval Southern Europe during the period of Arab\nrule in Sicily beginning around the 9th century.^[37]^[38] In addition to\nSicily, Al-Andalus (in what is currently southern Spain) was an important\ncenter of sugar production, beginning by the tenth century.^[39]^[40]\n\nFrom the Arab world, sugar was exported throughout Europe. The volume of\nimports increased in the later medieval centuries as indicated by the\nincreasing references to sugar consumption in late medieval Western writings.\nBut cane sugar remained an expensive import. Its price per pound in 14th and\n15th century England was about equally as high as imported spices from\ntropical Asia such as mace (nutmeg), ginger, cloves, and pepper, which had to\nbe transported across the Indian Ocean in that era.^[4]\n\nClive Ponting traces the spread of the cultivation of sugarcane from its\nintroduction into Mesopotamia, then the Levant and the islands of the eastern\nMediterranean, especially Cyprus, by the 10th century.^[41] He also notes that\nit spread along the coast of East Africa to reach Zanzibar.^[41]\n\nCrusaders brought sugar home with them to Europe after their campaigns in the\nHoly Land, where they encountered caravans carrying what they called \"sweet\nsalt\".^[42] Early in the 12th century, Venice acquired some villages near Tyre\nand set up estates to produce sugar for export to Europe, where it\nsupplemented honey as the only other available sweetener.^[43] Crusade\nchronicler William of Tyre, writing in the late 12th century, described sugar\nas \"a most precious product, very necessary for the use and health of\nmankind\".^[44] The first record of sugar in English is in the late 13th\ncentury.^[45]\n\nPonting recounts the reliance on slavery of the early European sugar\nentrepreneurs:\n\n> The crucial problem with sugar production was that it was highly labour-\n> intensive in both growing and processing. Because of the huge weight and\n> bulk of the raw cane it was very costly to transport, especially by land,\n> and therefore each estate had to have its own factory. There the cane had to\n> be crushed to extract the juices, which were boiled to concentrate them, in\n> a series of backbreaking and intensive operations lasting many hours.\n> However, once it had been processed and concentrated, the sugar had a very\n> high value for its bulk and could be traded over long distances by ship at a\n> considerable profit. The [European sugar] industry only began on a major\n> scale after the loss of the Levant to a resurgent Islam and the shift of\n> production to Cyprus under a mixture of Crusader aristocrats and Venetian\n> merchants. The local population on Cyprus spent most of their time growing\n> their own food and few would work on the sugar estates. The owners therefore\n> brought in slaves from the Black Sea area (and a few from Africa) to do most\n> of the work. The level of demand and production was low and therefore so was\n> the trade in slaves \u2014 no more than about a thousand people a year. It was\n> not much larger when sugar production began in Sicily.\n>\n> In the Atlantic ocean [the Canaries, Madeira, and the Cape Verde Islands],\n> once the initial exploitation of the timber and raw materials was over, it\n> rapidly became clear that sugar production would be the most profitable way\n> of getting money from the new territories. The problem was the heavy labour\n> involved because the Europeans refused to work except as supervisors. The\n> solution was to bring in slaves from Africa. The crucial developments in\n> this trade began in the 1440's...^[43]\n\nDuring the 1390s, a better press was developed, which doubled the amount of\njuice that was obtained from the sugarcane and helped to cause the economic\nexpansion of sugar plantations to Andalusia and to the Algarve. It started in\nMadeira in 1455, using advisers from Sicily and (largely) Genoese capital for\nthe mills. The accessibility of Madeira attracted Genoese and Flemish traders\nkeen to bypass Venetian monopolies. \"By 1480 Antwerp had some seventy ships\nengaged in the Madeira sugar trade, with the refining and distribution\nconcentrated in Antwerp. The 1480's saw sugar production extended to the\nCanary Islands. By the 1490's Madeira had overtaken Cyprus as a producer of\nsugar.\"^[46] African slaves also worked in the sugar plantations of the\nKingdom of Castile around Valencia.^[46]\n\n## Sugar cultivation in the New World[edit]\n\nThe Triangular trade - enslaved people were imported into the Caribbean\nIslands to plant and harvest sugar cane.\n\nSee also: Slavery in the British and French Caribbean and Slavery in the\ncolonial United States\n\nThe Portuguese took sugar to Brazil. By 1540, there were 800 cane sugar mills\nin Santa Catarina Island and there were another 2,000 on the north coast of\nBrazil, Demarara, and Surinam. The first sugar harvest happened in Hispaniola\nin 1501; and many sugar mills had been constructed in Cuba and Jamaica by the\n1520s.^[47]\n\nThe approximately 3,000 small sugar mills that were built before 1550 in the\nNew World created an unprecedented demand for cast iron gears, levers, axles\nand other implements. Specialist trades in mold-making and iron casting\ndeveloped in Europe due to the expansion of sugar production. Sugar mill\nconstruction sparked development of the technological skills needed for a\nnascent industrial revolution in the early 17th century.^[47]\n\nAfter 1625, the Dutch transported sugarcane from South America to the\nCaribbean islands, where it was grown from Barbados to the Virgin\nIslands.^[citation needed]\n\nContemporaries often compared the worth of sugar with valuable commodities\nincluding musk, pearls, and spices. Sugar prices declined slowly as its\nproduction became multi-sourced throughout the European colonies. Once an\nindulgence only of the rich, the consumption of sugar also became increasingly\ncommon among the poor as well. Sugar production increased in the mainland\nNorth American colonies, in Cuba, and in Brazil. The labour force at first\nincluded European indentured servants and local Native American enslaved\npeople. However, European diseases such as smallpox and African ones such as\nmalaria and yellow fever soon reduced the numbers of local Native\nAmericans.^[47] Europeans were also very susceptible to malaria and yellow\nfever, and the supply of indentured servants was limited. African slaves\nbecame the dominant source of plantation workers, because they were more\nresistant to malaria and yellow fever, and because the supply of enslaved\npeople was abundant on the African coast.^[48]^[49]\n\n> \"When we work at the sugar-canes, and the mill snatches hold of a finger,\n> they cut off the hand; and when we attempt to run away, they cut off the\n> leg; both cases have happened to me. This is the price at which you eat\n> sugar in Europe.\"\n\n\u2014Voltaire, Candide, Chap. 19\n\nIn the process of whitening sugar, the charred bones of dead enslaved people\noften supplemented the traditionally used animal bones.^[50]\n\nDuring the 18th century, sugar became enormously popular. Great Britain, for\nexample, consumed five times as much sugar in 1770 as in 1710.^[51] By 1750,\nsugar surpassed grain as \"the most valuable commodity in European trade \u2014 it\nmade up a fifth of all European imports and in the last decades of the century\nfour-fifths of the sugar came from the British and French colonies in the West\nIndies.\"^[51] From the 1740s until the 1820s, sugar was Britain's most\nvaluable import.^[52]\n\nThe sugar market went through a series of booms. The heightened demand and\nproduction of sugar came about to a large extent due to a great change in the\neating habits of many Europeans. For example, they began consuming jams,\ncandy, tea, coffee, cocoa, processed foods, and other sweet victuals in much\ngreater amounts. Reacting to this increasing trend, the Caribbean islands took\nadvantage of the situation and set about producing still more sugar. In fact,\nthey produced up to ninety percent of the sugar that the western Europeans\nconsumed. Some islands proved more successful than others when it came to\nproducing the product. In Barbados and the British Leeward Islands, sugar\nprovided 93% and 97% respectively of exports.\n\nPlanters later began developing ways to boost production even more. For\nexample, they began using more farming methods when growing their crops. They\nalso developed more advanced mills and began using better types of sugarcane.\nIn the eighteenth century \"the French colonies were the most successful,\nespecially Saint-Domingue, where better irrigation, water-power and machinery,\ntogether with concentration on newer types of sugar, increased profits.\"^[51]\nDespite these and other improvements, the price of sugar reached soaring\nheights, especially during events such as the revolt against the Dutch^[53]\nand the Napoleonic Wars. Sugar remained in high demand, and the islands'\nplanters knew exactly how to take advantage of the situation.\n\nA 19th-century lithograph by Theodore Bray showing a sugarcane plantation. On\nright is \"white officer\", the European overseer. Enslaved workers toil during\nthe harvest. To the left is a flat-bottomed vessel for cane transportation.\n\nAs Europeans established sugar plantations on the larger Caribbean islands,\nprices fell in Europe. By the 18th century all levels of society had become\ncommon consumers of the former luxury product. At first most sugar in Britain\nwent into tea, but later confectionery and chocolates became extremely\npopular. Many Britons (especially children) also ate jams.^[54] Suppliers\ncommonly sold sugar in the form of a sugarloaf and consumers required sugar\nnips, a pliers-like tool, to break off pieces.\n\nSugarcane quickly exhausts the soil in which it grows, and planters pressed\nlarger islands with fresher soil into production in the nineteenth century as\ndemand for sugar in Europe continued to increase: \"average consumption in\nBritain rose from four pounds per head in 1700 to eighteen pounds in 1800,\nthirty-six pounds by 1850 and over one hundred pounds by the twentieth\ncentury.\"^[55] In the 19th century Cuba rose to become the richest land in the\nCaribbean (with sugar as its dominant crop) because it formed the only major\nisland landmass free of mountainous terrain. Instead, nearly three-quarters of\nits land formed a rolling plain \u2014 ideal for planting crops. Cuba also\nprospered above other islands because Cubans used better methods when\nharvesting the sugar crops: they adopted modern milling methods such as\nwatermills, enclosed furnaces, steam engines, and vacuum pans. All these\ntechnologies increased productivity. Cuba also retained slavery longer than\nthe most of the rest of the Caribbean islands.^[56]\n\nHacienda La Fortuna. A sugar mill complex in Puerto Rico, painted by Francisco\nOller in 1885. Brooklyn Museum\n\nAfter the Haitian Revolution established the independent state of Haiti, sugar\nproduction in that country declined and Cuba replaced Saint-Domingue as the\nworld's largest producer.^[citation needed]\n\nLong established in Brazil, sugar production spread to other parts of South\nAmerica, as well as to newer European colonies in Africa and in the Pacific,\nwhere it became especially important in Fiji. Mauritius, Natal and Queensland\nin Australia started growing sugar. The older and newer sugar production areas\nnow tended to use indentured labour rather than enslaved people, with workers\n\"shipped across the world ... [and] ... held in conditions of near slavery for\nup to ten years... In the second half of the nineteenth century over 450,000\nindentured labourers went from India to the British West Indies, others went\nto Natal, Mauritius and Fiji (where they became a majority of the population).\nIn Queensland workers from the Pacific islands were moved in. On Hawaii, they\ncame from China and Japan. The Dutch transferred large numbers of people from\nJava to Surinam.\"^[57] It is said that the sugar plantations would not have\nthrived without the aid of the African enslaved people. In Colombia, the\nplanting of sugar started very early on, and entrepreneurs imported many\nAfrican enslaved people to cultivate the fields. The industrialization of the\nColombian industry started in 1901 with the establishment of Manuelita, the\nfirst steam-powered sugar mill in South America, by Latvian Jewish immigrant\nJames Martin Eder.\n\n## The rise of beet sugar[edit]\n\nFurther information: Sugar beet \u00a7 History\n\nGerman chemists Andreas Sigismund Marggraf and Franz Karl Achard (pictured)\nboth laid the foundation of the modern sugar industry\n\nSugar was a luxury in Europe until the early 19th century, when it became more\nwidely available, due to the rise of beet sugar in Prussia, and later in\nFrance under Napoleon.^[58] Beet sugar was a German invention, since, in 1747,\nAndreas Sigismund Marggraf announced the discovery of sugar in beets and\ndevised a method using alcohol to extract it.^[59] Marggraf's student, Franz\nKarl Achard, devised an economical industrial method to extract the sugar in\nits pure form in the late 18th century.^[60]^[61] Achard first produced beet\nsugar in 1783 in Kaulsdorf. In 1801, under the patronage of King Frederick\nWilliam III of Prussia (reigned 1797\u20131840), the world's first beet sugar\nproduction facility was established in Cunern, Silesia (then part of\nPrussia).^[62] While never profitable, this plant operated from 1801 until its\ndestruction during the Napoleonic Wars (ca. 1802\u20131815).^[citation needed]\n\nSugar refinery in \u0160urany (Slovakia), founded in 1854 (picture from 1900).\n\nThe works of Marggraf and Achard were the starting point for the sugar\nindustry in Europe,^[63] and for the modern sugar industry in general, since\nsugar was no longer a luxury product and a product almost only produced in\nwarmer climates.^[64]\n\nIn France, Napoleon cut off from Caribbean imports by a British blockade, and\nat any rate not wanting to fund British merchants, banned imports of sugar in\n1813 and ordered the planting of 32,000 hectares with beetroot.^[65] A beet\nsugar industry emerged, especially after Jean-Baptiste Qu\u00e9ruel industrialized\nthe operation of Benjamin Delessert.\n\nThe United Kingdom Beetroot Sugar Association was established in 1832 but\nefforts to establish sugar beet in the UK were not very successful. Sugar\nbeets provided approximately 2/3 of world sugar production in 1899. 46% of\nBritish sugar came from Germany and Austria. Sugar prices in Britain collapsed\ntowards the end of the 19th century. The British Sugar Beet Society was set up\nin 1915 and by 1930 there were 17 factories in England and one in Scotland,\nsupported under the provisions of the British Sugar (Subsidy) Act 1925. By\n1935 homegrown sugar was 27.6% of British consumption. By 1929 109,201 people\nwere employed in the British sugar beet industry, with about 25,000 more\ncasual labourers.^[66]\n\n## Mechanization[edit]\n\nBeginning in the late 18th century, the production of sugar became\nincreasingly mechanized. The steam engine first powered a sugar mill in\nJamaica in 1768, and soon after, steam replaced direct firing as the source of\nprocess heat.\n\nIn 1813 the British chemist Edward Charles Howard invented a method of\nrefining sugar that involved boiling the cane juice not in an open kettle, but\nin a closed vessel heated by steam and held under partial vacuum. At reduced\npressure, water boils at a lower temperature, and this development both saved\nfuel and reduced the amount of sugar lost through caramelization. Further\ngains in fuel-efficiency came from the multiple-effect evaporator, designed by\nthe United States engineer Norbert Rillieux (perhaps as early as the 1820s,\nalthough the first working model dates from 1845). This system consisted of a\nseries of vacuum pans, each held at a lower pressure than the previous one.\nThe vapors from each pan served to heat the next, with minimal heat wasted.\nModern industries use multiple-effect evaporators for evaporating water.\n\nThe process of separating sugar from molasses also received mechanical\nattention: David Weston first applied the centrifuge to this task in Hawaii in\n1852.\n\n## Other sweeteners[edit]\n\nSee also: Sugar substitute\n\nCyclamate-based sugar substitute sold in Canada.\n\nIn the United States and Japan, high-fructose corn syrup has replaced sugar in\nsome uses, particularly in soft drinks and processed foods.\n\nThe process by which high-fructose corn syrup is produced was first developed\nby Richard O. Marshall and Earl R. Kooi in 1957.^[67] The industrial\nproduction process was refined by Dr. Y. Takasaki at Agency of Industrial\nScience and Technology of Ministry of International Trade and Industry of\nJapan in 1965\u20131970. High-fructose corn syrup was rapidly introduced to many\nprocessed foods and soft drinks in the United States from around 1975 to 1985.\n\nA system of sugar tariffs and sugar quotas imposed in 1977 in the United\nStates significantly increased the cost of imported sugar and U.S. producers\nsought cheaper sources. High-fructose corn syrup, derived from corn, is more\neconomical because the domestic U.S. price of sugar is twice the global\nprice^[68] and the price of corn is kept low through government subsidies paid\nto growers.^[69]^[70] High-fructose corn syrup became an attractive\nsubstitute, and is preferred over cane sugar among the vast majority of\nAmerican food and beverage manufacturers. Soft drink makers such as Coca-Cola\nand Pepsi use sugar in other nations, but switched to high-fructose corn syrup\nin the United States in 1984.^[71]\n\nThe average American consumed approximately 37.8 lb (17.1 kg) of high-fructose\ncorn syrup in 2008, versus 46.7 lb (21.2 kg) of sucrose.^[72]\n\nIn recent years it has been hypothesized that the increase of high-fructose\ncorn syrup usage in processed foods may be linked to various health\nconditions, including metabolic syndrome, hypertension, dyslipidemia, hepatic\nsteatosis, insulin resistance, and obesity. However, there is to date little\nevidence that high-fructose corn syrup is any unhealthier, calorie for\ncalorie, than sucrose or other simple sugars. The fructose content and\nfructose:glucose ratio of high-fructose corn syrup do not differ markedly from\nclarified apple juice.^[73] Some researchers hypothesize that fructose may\ntrigger the process by which fats are formed, to a greater extent than other\nsimple sugars.^[74] However, most commonly used blends of high-fructose corn\nsyrup contain a nearly one-to-one ratio of fructose and glucose, just like\ncommon sucrose, and should therefore be metabolically identical after the\nfirst steps of sucrose metabolism, in which the sucrose is split into fructose\nand glucose components. At the very least, the increasing prevalence of high-\nfructose corn syrup has certainly led to an increase in added sugar calories\nin food, which may reasonably increase the incidence of these and other\ndiseases.^[75]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Food portal\n  * History portal\n\n  * Sugar Cane and Rum Museum\n  * Castillo Serrall\u00e9s\n  * Hacienda Mercedita\n  * Food history\n  * Sugar industry\n  * Sugar Museum (Berlin)\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Sato 2014, p. 1.\n  2. ^ Galloway, J.

There is plentiful evidence that Yemen imported goods from India in the pre-Islamic era (see e.g. Periplus of the Erythrean Sea). Hence historians today tend to believe that when Dioscorides was writing in the 1st century AD, Yemen imported sugar from India; and, that it did not produce it locally, and that the sugar that Dioscorides obtained in Greece was an import from Yemen but ultimately became an import from India.
