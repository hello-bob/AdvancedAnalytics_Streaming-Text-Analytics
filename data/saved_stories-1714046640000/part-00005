He had been busy acting, editing the hospital magazine,\narguing with his mother by letter about whether Christianity and the war were\ncompatible (he thought not, and he had hard words to say about the Archbishop\nof Canterbury, who did). So he may not have noticed at first the presence of\nSiegfried Sassoon.\n\nWilfred had been reading, apparently by chance, some of Sassoon\u2019s poems and\nwas deeply moved by them, so it must have appeared to him providential that\nits author so unexpectedly appeared. Wilfred observed to his mother that he\nwould rather meet Sassoon than Tennyson, but the opportunity didn\u2019t come until\na week later, when he screwed up his courage to call on Sassoon.\n\nAt their first meeting, Sassoon treated Wilfred with a certain lordly\ncondescension. Wilfred persisted, however, and their next meeting was warmer.\nThey talked about poetry, and Sassoon asked Wilfred to help him decipher a\nhandwritten fan letter from H.G. Wells, written in pale pink ink.\n\nWilfred was smitten, so much so that he sat down at once afterward to write a\npoem in Sassoon\u2019s style:\n\nThe Dead-Beat (True\u2014in the incidental)\n\nHe dropped, more sullenly, then wearily,\n\nBecame a lump of stench, a clot of meat, And none of us could kick him to his\nfeet. He blinked at my revolver, blearily...\n\nWe sent him down at last, he seemed so bad,\n\nAlthough a strongish chap and quite unhurt. Next day I heard the Doc\u2019s fat\nlaugh: \u2018That dirt\n\nYou sent me down last night\u2019s just died. So glad!\u2019\n\nThis is nasty stuff, and one could have guessed it was based on personal\nexperience even without Wilfred\u2019s note that it was. Threatening a soldier with\na pistol who was reluctant to move forward was common enough in both armies,\nindeed it is one of the reasons officers carry a pistol in the first place.\nBut the tone of the poem\u2014and the sting of the last line\u2014sounds more like\nSassoon than Wilfred. There is no note of pity or sympathy, only a sharp,\npervading cruelty.\n\nOwen\u2019s life experiences were undramatic as inspirations for poetry, and yet\ngradually Sassoon became convinced that he was in the presence of genius.\n\nSassoon was genially critical of the younger poet\u2019s work, dismissing many of\nthe earlier sonnets as too lyrical, but he admired some of his more recent\nwork. Wilfred described the meeting to both his mother and, unusually, in a\nseparate letter to his father, urging Tom to read Sassoon\u2019s \u201cThe Death-Bed\u201d as\n\u201ca piece of perfect art,\u201d and telling him \u201cthere is nothing better this\ncentury can offer you.\u201d\n\nHe drowsed and was aware of silence heaped Round him, unshaken as the\nsteadfast walls... Light many lamps and gather round his bed. Lend him your\neyes, warm blood, and will to live. Speak to him; rouse him; you may save him\nyet. He\u2019s young, he hated war; how should he die When cruel old campaigners\nwin safe through? But death replied: \u201cI choose him.\u201d So he went, And there was\nsilence in the summer night... Then, far away, the thudding of the guns.\n\nWithin a week, he was writing to his mother, \u201cSiegfried called me in to him,\nand having condemned some of my poems, amended others, and rejoiced over a\nfew, he read me his last works, which are superb beyond anything in his Book.\nLast night he wrote a piece which is the most exquisitely painful war poem of\nany language or time. I don\u2019t tell him so, or that I am not worthy to light\nhis pipe.\u201d\n\nWilfred was in the full throes of hero worship, while Sassoon, although he may\nhave been better at concealing his emotions, was beginning to feel a powerful\nattraction for his handsome young admirer, critiquing and rewriting Wilfred\u2019s\npoems, who had sent home to his mother and sister for every scrap he had\nwritten.\n\nSassoon was all too often imperious. He kept Wilfred waiting for hours for\nlunch at his golf club while he finished his game (\u201ca severe fleshly trial,\u201d\nWilfred described it, since he had skipped breakfast). Then he made up for it\nby taking Wilfred for tea with the astronomer royal. (Sassoon seems to have\nknown everybody.) He offered to get Wilfred a staff job in England, but\nalthough Wilfred, like Sassoon himself, dreaded going back to the trenches, he\ndid not want special treatment.\n\nHe positively gushed about his new friend to his mother, inevitably arousing\nher suspicion or perhaps her jealousy. \u201cSassoon I like equally in all the ways\nyou mention,\u201d he replied to her. \u201cThe man is tall and noble-looking....The\nFriend is intensely sympathetic....He keeps all effusiveness strictly within\nhis pages. In this he is eminently English. It is so restful after the French\nabsurdities.\u201d (This is presumably a reference to Laurent Tailhade, the\nprevious poet with whom Wilfred had been smitten.)\n\nAt first Wilfred appeared to Sassoon merely as a promising minor poet, with a\nsheaf of lyrical poems that seemed now, in the fourth year of the war, to be\nout of tune with reality and mired in the past. Nor did Wilfred show evidence\nof the facile genius of Rupert Brooke, whose poems flowed like music,\napparently written without effort, and yet had the solid power of being based\non his own experiences.\n\nWilfred had neither the tempestuous love affairs nor the voyage to the South\nPacific as material to fall back on. His life experiences were undramatic as\ninspirations for poetry, and yet gradually Sassoon became convinced that he\nwas in the presence of genius. The suspicion was confirmed when he read an\nearly draft of \u201cAnthem for Doomed Youth,\u201d the most famous poem that would come\nout of the war, by far and away the most anthologized.\n\nSassoon\u2019s changes to the poem are relatively minor, but significant, and it is\neasy to see how much Wilfred owed his new friend. Originally called \u201cAnthem\nfor Dead Youth,\u201d the poem\u2019s early draft is powerful but lacks the concentrated\npunch of the final version.\n\nWhat passing-bells for you who die in herds?\n\nOnly the long monotonous [anger] of the guns!\n\nAnd only the stuttering rifles\u2019 rattled words\n\nCan patter out your hasty orisons.\n\nNo wreaths for you, nor balms, nor stately choirs;\n\nNor any voice of mourning, save our shells,\n\nAnd bugles calling for you from your shires,\n\nSaddening the twilight. These are our farewells.\n\nWhat candles may we hold to speed you all?\n\nNot in the hands of boys, but in their eyes\n\nShall shine the lights of your goodbyes.\n\nThe pallor of girls\u2019 brows must be your pall;\n\nYour flowers: the tenderness of comrades\u2019 minds;\n\nAnd each slow dusk, a drawing down of blinds.\n\nThe last line remains moving, but the focus of the draft is outward (\u201cyou who\ndie in herds\u201d). Although the form is there, the poem seems disjointed. Its\nfamiliar final form, with major changes Sassoon made underlined, is\nincomparably stronger.\n\nAnthem for Doomed Youth\n\nWhat passing bells for those who die as cattle?\n\nOnly the monstrous anger of the guns\n\nOnly the stuttering rifles\u2019 rapid rattle\n\nCan patter out their hasty orisons.\n\nNo mockeries for them, nor prayers, nor bells,\n\nNor any voice of mourning save the choirs\n\nThe shrill demented choirs of wailing shells;\n\nAnd bugles calling for them from sad shires.\n\nWhat candles may be held to speed them all?\n\nNot in the hands of boys, but in their eyes\n\nShall shine the holy glimmers of goodbyes.\n\nThe pallor of girls\u2019 brows shall be their pall,\n\nTheir flowers the tenderness of patient minds,\n\nAnd each slow dusk a drawing down of blinds.\n\nThe last line is indeed the valedictory that epitomizes the sadness that\nfollowed the war, as the British mourned the loss of more than 750,000 men.\nWilfred\u2019s war poems lack the ferocious anger and sarcasm of Sassoon\u2019s; he was\nperceptive enough to realize that and wrote of himself, \u201cMy subject is War and\nthe pity of War. The poetry is in the pity.\u201d It is appropriate then that his\nwords are incised on the black slate slab memorializing the war poets of the\nFirst World War in the Poet\u2019s Corner of Westminster Abbey.\n\nIt should not be imagined that the relationship between the two men was all\none way. Sassoon recognized in Wilfred a greater poet than himself, but his\nown poetry also improved as the two men worked together. Still, it was Sassoon\nwho remained in Wilfred\u2019s eyes \u201cthe great man,\u201d an impression no doubt\ninfluenced by class.\n\nWilfred managed to persuade Sassoon to let him publish one of his poems in The\nHydra, alongside an unsigned one of his own. It was surely the growing\nfriendship between the two men that gave Wilfred the confidence to go out in\ncompany in Edinburgh and even to sit for his portrait, both in a charcoal\ndrawing and a watercolor. Although Sassoon warned Wilfred not to publish his\npoems too soon, he nevertheless went out of his way to bring the younger man\u2019s\nname to the attention of his set, both those involved in poetry and the\nsmaller world of gay friends, many of whom were influential in the arts.\n\nIn mid-October, Sassoon\u2019s friend and fellow Royal Welch Fusiliers officer,\nRobert Graves, arrived for a brief visit. Graves bridged both worlds; he was a\npublished poet and an active homosexual. (Although he would soon shock Sassoon\nby falling in love with a young woman, whom he would eventually marry, and go\non to marry twice and father eight children.) Graves was one of those men who\nfill up a lot of space, both physically and psychically.\n\nMore than that, he had reached the rank of captain, unusually for a young\nofficer who was not a regular soldier, with three pips on his sleeve to\nWilfred\u2019s one. He was fiercely opinionated, even argumentative on almost every\nsubject under the sun. He both impressed and frightened Wilfred, whose\nambivalent reaction to Graves and his sense of class envy are evident in his\nletter to his mother about the meeting.\n\nHe [Graves] is a big, rather plain fellow, the last man on earth apparently\ncapable of the extraordinary, delicate fancies in his books....No doubt he\nthought me a slacker sort of sub. S.S. [substitute Siegfried Sassoon] when\nthey were together showed him my longish war-piece \u2018Disabled\u2019 (you haven\u2019t\nseen it) & it seems Graves was mightily impressed, and considers me a kind of\nFind! ! No thanks, Captain Graves! I\u2019ll find myself in due time.\n\nThere is a slight tone of resentment in the letter. Wilfred may have been\nunhappy at having to share Sassoon with a poet whose work had already been\npublished, or he may have felt that Graves was patronizing him. In fact,\nWilfred was at the height of his powers. The poem that had impressed Graves is\none of Wilfred\u2019s sharpest, and he had just completed his \u201cgas poem,\u201d \u201cDulce et\nDecorum Est,\u201d which many consider the final statement on the sacrifice of a\nwhole generation in the mud and blood of Flanders.\n\nBent double, like old beggars under sacks, Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we\ncursed through sludge, Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs, And\ntowards our distant rest began to trudge, Men marched asleep. Many had lost\ntheir boots, But limped on, blood-shod. All were lame, all blind; Drunk with\nfatigue; deaf even to the hoots Of gas-shells dropping softly behind. Gas!\nGAS! Quick, boys!\u2014an ecstasy of fumbling Fitting the clumsy helmets just in\ntime, But someone still was yelling out and stumbling And flound\u2019ing like a\nman in fire or lime\u2014 Dim through the misty panes and thick green light, As\nunder a green sea, I saw him drowning. In all my dreams before my helpless\nsight, He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning. If in some smothering\ndream, you too could pace Behind the wagon that we flung him in, And watch the\nwhite eyes writhing in his face, His hanging face, like a devil\u2019s sick of sin;\nIf you could hear, at every jolt, the blood Come gargling from the froth-\ncorrupted lungs, Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud Of vile, incurable sores\non innocent tongues,\u2014 My friend, you would not tell with such high zest To\nchildren ardent for some desperate glory, The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est.\nPro patria mori.\n\nThis turned out to be an enormously productive period for Wilfred, given the\ndaily presence of a friend and fellow poet who urged him on. He was simply\nhappy to have a sounding board for his poems other than his mother, although\nin the end it was still she that he sought most to please. He wrote six poems\nin one burst, including one of his strongest, about death, which begins: \u201cOut\nthere, we\u2019ve walked quite friendly up to Death,\u2014 / Sat down and eaten with\nhim, cool and bland.\u201d\n\nWilfred Owen would soon outshine all other English First World War poets, the\nspokesman for a martyred generation.\n\nTo his mother, Owen described his new life at Craiglockhart, where he read his\npoems aloud \u201cover a private tea\u201d in Sassoon\u2019s room. Sassoon had at last\nmanaged to get a room to himself, thanks to Rivers. Owens also passed on the\nnews that Sassoon had changed his mind and now thought Owen should get his\nmanuscripts typed up for submission to a publisher.\n\nIt is hard not to see this as the happiest time of Owen\u2019s life. He was\nrelieved of responsibilities and was immensely productive. His work was being\nappreciated and taken seriously, if only by one person, and he was in love.\nHis brother Harold scoured his letters so thoroughly after his death that it\nis impossible to tell whether Owen had a physical relationship with Sassoon,\nbut in every other respect it was the closest he would ever come to a love\naffair. \u201cSpent all day [with Sassoon] yesterday,\u201d he wrote his mother\necstatically. \u201cBreakfast, Lunch, Tea & Dinner.\u201d\n\nIt could not last. Wilfred was examined at the end of October and had no doubt\nthat the medical board would find him fit for duty. His symptoms were under\ncontrol, and his nightmares were less frequent, perhaps because he had\nchanneled them into his poems. The need for young officers was greater than\never. In France, Haig\u2019s autumn campaign was eating up lives at a furious rate,\nand the outlook for the Allies had never seemed darker.\n\nThe Russian collapse was now beyond repair or doubt, and the Battle of\nCaporetto cost the Italians over 300,000 casualties plus almost as many\ncaptured, a rout masterfully portrayed by Ernest Hemingway in A Farewell to\nArms. The arrival of the Americans in force was delayed\u2014it takes time to train\nand equip a whole army from scratch\u2014while everywhere Germany and Austro-\nHungary seemed stronger. Only in the Middle East was there a ray of hope as\nGeneral Allenby\u2019s army captured Jerusalem, the first sign of the Ottoman\ncollapse. Everybody was needed at the front, no matter how frail or damaged.\n\nWilfred and Sassoon spent their last evening together at the Scottish\nConservative Club in Edinburgh, eating a good dinner, drinking \u201ca noble bottle\nof Burgundy\u201d and laughing uproariously over a volume of especially bad poetry.\nSassoon had given Wilfred, as a parting gift, a thick envelope, which he\nopened in the club while waiting to take the midnight train. It contained a\nten-pound note and a letter of introduction to Robert Ross in London, the\nfriend, editor, and devoted defender of Oscar Wilde and a literary luminary\nalmost as well connected and admired as Edward Marsh. Ross was a friend of\nH.G. Wells, Arnold Bennett, and Osbert Sitwell, as well as a central figure in\nthe homosexual literary and social world.\n\nSassoon must have hesitated before including the ten-pound note for fear it\nmight be taken as an insult, but Wilfred responded with genuine gratitude.\n\nKnow that since mid-September, when you still regarded me as a tiresome little\nknocker on your door I held you as Keats + Christ + Elijah + my Colonel + my\nfather-confessor + Amenophis IV in profile.... I love you, dispassionately, so\nmuch, so very much, dear Fellow, that the blasting little smile you wear on\nreading this can\u2019t hurt me in the least....And you have fixed my life\u2014however\nshort. I was always a mad comet; but you have fixed me. I spun around you a\nsatellite for a month, but I shall swing out soon, a dark star in the orbit\nwhere you will blaze.\n\nThis passage was prophetic, Wilfred Owen would soon outshine all other English\nFirst World War poets, the spokesman for a martyred generation. He ended his\nletter with a phrase he had used earlier to his mother to describe his\nrelationship with Sassoon: \u201c[We] knew we loved each other as no men love for\nlong.\u201d\n\n__________________________________\n\nExcerpted from Muse of Fire: World War I as Seen Through the Lives of the\nSoldier Poets by Michael Korda.
