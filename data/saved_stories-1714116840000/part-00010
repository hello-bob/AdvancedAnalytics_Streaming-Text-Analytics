The posthumous daughter of privateer Theodore\nPaleologus, the only surviving source on Godscall is her baptismal records.\nNothing is known of her life.\n\nThe meaning of her name is unknown. It might be an English equivalent of the\nGreek name Theocletiane (\u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae), a reference to the child possibly being\nsickly, a surname derived from one of her mother's ancestors, or might derive\nfrom one or both of her parents being Puritans (though there is no evidence\nthat they were), who in the 17th century commonly gave Godly names to their\nchildren.\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\nSt Dunstan's, Stepney, where Godscall was baptised on 24 January 1694\n\nGodscall Paleologue was born on 12 January 1694, the daughter of the privateer\nTheodore Paleologus, who had died the year before, and his wife Martha\nBradbury. She was baptised twelve days later, on 24 January, with the\nregisters of St Dunstan's Church in the East London district of Stepney\nreading \"January 24 Godscall daughter of Theodore Paleologus of upp. Wapping\nGent: and of Martha uxor. 12 days old\".^[1]\n\nShe was the last recorded member of the Paleologus family, which claimed to be\na branch of the ancient Palaiologos dynasty, rulers of the Byzantine Empire\nfrom 1259 to the fall of Constantinople in 1453.^[1] The Paleologus family\nclaimed descent from Thomas Palaiologos, a brother of Constantine XI\nPalaiologos (the last emperor), through a son called John, whose existence can\nnot be confirmed through contemporary sources. All other purported ancestors\n(descendants of this John) of the later Paleologus family can be verified\nthrough contemporary records, making their descent from the emperors\nplausible, but somewhat uncertain.^[2]\n\nIn The Traveller's Tree: A Journey Through the Caribbean Islands (1950),\nEnglish historian Patrick Leigh Fermor wrote (on Godscall) that \"this oddly-\nnamed little girl remains the last authentic descendant of the Paleologi\"^[3]\nand in Byzantium: The Decline and Fall (1995), English popular historian John\nJulius Norwich identified Godscall as \"the last known descendant of the\nEmperors of Byzantium\".^[4] If her lineage is true, she could be considered\nthe last true heir to the Roman imperial office.^[5]\n\nNothing is known of Godscall's life after her baptism, the last contemporary\naccounts being of her as a little girl in East London in 1694.^[3]^[6]^[7] It\nis not known whether she survived infancy, as no other records of her have\nbeen discovered.^[3]^[6] John Hall, author of a 2015 biography on Godscall's\ngreat-grandfather Theodore Paleologus, believes Godscall died soon after her\nbaptism, perhaps within hours or days, but does not offer any evidence to\nsupport this theory beyond the fact that there are no known sources on her\nlife beyond her baptism.^[1] Other authors, such as Fermor and Norwich, simply\nmaintained that details on Godscall's further life were unknown.^[3]^[4]\n\n## Name[edit]\n\nGodscall's unusual name has been the subject of much speculation,^[1] with it\ntypically being identified as \"strange\" or \"eccentric\".^[3]^[4] One\npossibility is that \"Godscall\" was a surname, perhaps derived from one of her\nmother's ancestors. Another explanation is that one or both of her parents\nwere Puritans (though there is no evidence that they were), who in the 17th\ncentury often gave eccentric godly names to their children, such as Sorry for\nSin or Fear the Lord. Hall suggests that the girl may have been sickly and\nthat her mother feared for her imminent death, accepting that \"God was calling\nher\" and thus giving the child the name \"Godscall\".^[1]\n\nWriting in 1977, the Greek historian Georgios Zoras believed that the name\nGodscall was an English equivalent of the Greek name Theocletiane\n(\u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae), which essentially means \"God's call\". More common female\nvariants of this Greek name are Theoclete (\u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03ba\u03bb\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7) and Theocleto (\u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03ce)\n(the male variant is Theocletos [\u0398\u03b5\u03cc\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2]).^[8]\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\nWith the only known surviving record of Godscall being her entry in the\nbaptismal registers, her existence remained unknown for centuries. The record,\nand by extension Godscall herself, was not discovered until 1946 when\nresearcher Cregoe Nicholson examined St Dunstan's registers in Stepney.^[9]\n\nTradition has it that during the Greek War of Independence (1821\u20131829), over a\ncentury after the Paleologus family disappeared from history, a delegation was\nsent by the Greek provisional government in Athens to find living descendants\nof the old imperial family. The delegation reportedly searched in vain for a\ndescendants in Cornwall and Barbados (where ancestors of Godscall were known\nto have lived).^[10]^[11] The delegation would have been unaware of any\nPaleologi in London due to Godscall's entry in the baptismal registers not yet\nhaving been discovered.^[9]\n\nThe Paleologus family have sometimes been featured in popular culture. Most of\nthese appearances have to do with Theodore Paleologus of Cornwall (Godscall's\ngreat-grandfather by the same name as her father), and fictional descendants\nof him, though some tackle the family as a whole. Notably, the novel The\nCourse of the Heart (1992) by science fiction and fantasy author M. John\nHarrison accords magic to the Paleologus family as imperial descendants. In\nthe novel, Godscall is born in 1666 to a Constantine Paleologus of Barbados\n(not in 1694 to Theodore) and Harrison writes that this Godscall \"carried in\nher bones the cup, the map, the mirror \u2013 the real heritage of the Empress and\nthe real Clue to the Heart\". In the novel, Godscall becomes an almost\notherworldly \"deathless empress\" and a modern epileptic woman with visions is\nrevealed to be either her descendant or her reincarnation.^[12]\n\nIn Jane Stevenson's novel Empress of the Last Days (2003), the hero of the\nbook falls in love with a young black-skinned Barbadian girl by the name\nMelita Paleologue and they trace her lineage to the marriage between a\ndaughter of King James VI & I, Elizabeth Stuart (called \"the Winter Queen\"),\nand a dark-skinned physician (Elizabeth Stuart was actually married to\nFrederick V of the Palatinate). In the book, Godscall's father dies a hero in\nbattle at A Coru\u00f1a, rather than as a privateer (as he did in real life), and\nhis daughter Godscall marries a son of the Winter Queen. The historical\ndelegation sent to Cornwall during the Greek War of Independence in search for\ndescendants of the old imperial dynasty also appears in the novel, but is\nportrayed as discounting the proof presented by Godscall's descendants on\naccount of their skin color.^[13] In reference to her depictions in popular\nculture, Hall referred to Godscall as rising \"phoenix-like from the grave\" and\nto her being \"a deathless empress in another dimension\".^[1]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d ^e ^f Hall 2015, p. 209.\n  2. ^ Hall 2015, p. 38.\n  3. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d ^e Fermor 2010.\n  4. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c Norwich 1995.\n  5. ^ Foster 2015, p. 67.\n  6. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Brandow 1983, p. 436.\n  7. ^ Carr 2015, p. 259.\n  8. ^ Zoras 1977, p. 308.\n  9. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Hall 2015, p. 208.\n  10. ^ Hall 2015, p. 14.\n  11. ^ Schomburg 2012, p. 230.\n  12. ^ Hall 2015, p. 215.\n  13. ^ Hall 2015, p. 216.\n\n### Cited bibliography[edit]\n\n  * Brandow, James C.
