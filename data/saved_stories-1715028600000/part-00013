Intellectual, scientific, and artistic activities belong to\nthe province of Extremistan, where there is a severe concentration of success,\nwith a very small number of winners claiming a large share of the pot. This\nseems to apply to all professional activities I find nondull and \u201cinteresting\u201d\n(I am still looking for a single counterexample, a nondull activity that\nbelongs to Mediocristan).\n\nAcknowledging the role of this concentration of success, and acting\naccordingly, causes us to be punished twice: we live in a society where the\nreward mechanism is based on the illusion of the regular; our hormonal reward\nsystem also needs tangible and steady results. It too thinks that the world is\nsteady and well behaved\u2014it falls for the confirmation error. The world has\nchanged too fast for our genetic makeup. We are alienated from our\nenvironment. PEER CRUELTY\n\nEvery morning you leave your cramped apartment in Manhattan\u2019s East Village to\ngo to your laboratory at the Rockefeller University in the East Sixties. You\nreturn in the late evening, and people in your social network ask you if you\nhad a good day, just to be polite. At the laboratory, people are more tactful.\nOf course you did not have a good day; you found nothing. You are not a watch\nrepairman. Your finding nothing is very valuable, since it is part of the\nprocess of discovery\u2014hey, you know where not to look. Other researchers,\nknowing your results, would avoid trying your special experiment, provided a\njournal is thoughtful enough to consider your \u201cfound nothing\u201d as information\nand publish it.\n\nMeanwhile your brother-in-law is a salesman for a Wall Street firm, and keeps\ngetting large commissions\u2014large and steady commissions. \u201cHe is doing very\nwell,\u201d you hear, particularly from your father-in-law, with a small pensive\nnanosecond of silence after the utterance\u2014which makes you realize that he just\nmade a comparison. It was involuntary, but he made one.\n\nHolidays can be terrible. You run into your brother-in-law at family reunions\nand, invariably, detect unmistakable signs of frustration on the part of your\nwife, who, briefly, fears that she married a loser, before remembering the\nlogic of your profession. But she has to fight her first impulse. Her sister\nwill not stop talking about their renovations, their new wallpaper. Your wife\nwill be a little more silent than usual on the drive home. This sulking will\nbe made slightly worse because the car you are driving is rented, since you\ncannot afford to garage a car in Manhattan. What should you do? Move to\nAustralia and thereby make family reunions less frequent, or switch brothers-\nin-laws by marrying someone with a less \u201csuccessful\u201d brother?\n\nOr should you dress like a hippie and become defiant? That may work for an\nartist, but not so easily for a scientist or a businessman. You are trapped.\n\nYou work on a project that does not deliver immediate or steady results; all\nthe while, people around you work on projects that do. You are in trouble.\nSuch is the lot of scientists, artists, and researchers lost in society rather\nthan living in an insulated community or an artist colony.\n\nPositive lumpy outcomes, for which we either collect big or get nothing,\nprevail in numerous occupations, those invested with a sense of mission, such\nas doggedly pursuing (in a smelly laboratory) the elusive cure for cancer,\nwriting a book that will change the way people view the world (while living\nhand to mouth), making music, or painting miniature icons on subway trains and\nconsidering it a higher form of art despite the diatribes of the antiquated\n\u201cscholar\u201d Harold Bloom.\n\nIf you are a researcher, you will have to publish inconsequential articles in\n\u201cprestigious\u201d publications so that others say hello to you once in a while\nwhen you run into them at conferences.\n\nIf you run a public corporation, things were great for you before you had\nshareholders, when you and your partners were the sole owners, along with\nsavvy venture capitalists who understood uneven results and the lumpy nature\nof economic life. But now you have a slow-thinking thirty-year-old security\nanalyst at a downtown Manhattan firm who \u201cjudges\u201d your results and reads too\nmuch into them. He likes routine rewards, and the last thing you can deliver\nare routine rewards.\n\nMany people labor in life under the impression that they are doing something\nright, yet they may not show solid results for a long time. They need a\ncapacity for continuously adjourned gratification to survive a steady diet of\npeer cruelty without becoming demoralized. They look like idiots to their\ncousins, they look like idiots to their peers, they need courage to continue.\nNo confirmation comes to them, no validation, no fawning students, no Nobel,\nno Shnobel. \u201cHow was your year?\u201d brings them a small but containable spasm of\npain deep inside, since almost all of their years will seem wasted to someone\nlooking at their life from the outside. Then bang, the lumpy event comes that\nbrings the grand vindication. Or it may never come.\n\nBelieve me, it is tough to deal with the social consequences of the appearance\nof continuous failure. We are social animals; hell is other people.\n\nPart B\u2019: http://www.lecturesbureau.gr/1/living-in-the-antechamber-of-hope-\npart-b-969b/?lang=en\n\nThe Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable Nassim Nicholas Taleb\n\nThe ETERNITY candle is our symbol!\n\nIt has an Oriental scent and flame of bliss...\n\nIt also gives breath of eternity to our scenery because words have a magic\npower that is released when we believe in them!\n\nLB STORE\n\n### \u03a3\u03c7\u03b5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u039a\u03b5\u03af\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1\n\n  * I thank all those PAULO COELHO\n\nI thank all those who laughed at my dreams; You have inspired my imagination.\nI thank all who wanted to squeeze me into their scheme; They have taught me\nthe value of freedom.
