Previous\nstudies have shown that an increase in the pH of respiratory aerosols\nfollowing generation due to changes in the gas-particle partitioning of pH\nbuffering bicarbonate ions and carbon dioxide is a significant factor in\nreducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. We show here that a significant increase in\nSARS-CoV-2 aerostability results from a moderate increase in the atmospheric\ncarbon dioxide concentration (e.g. 800 ppm), an effect that is more marked\nthan that observed for changes in relative humidity. We model the likelihood\nof COVID-19 transmission on the ambient concentration of CO_2, concluding that\neven this moderate increase in CO_2 concentration results in a significant\nincrease in overall risk. These observations confirm the critical importance\nof ventilation and maintaining low CO_2 concentrations in indoor environments\nfor mitigating disease transmission. Moreover, the correlation of increased\nCO_2 concentration with viral aerostability need to be better understood when\nconsidering the consequences of increases in ambient CO_2 levels in our\natmosphere.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Modeling the impact of indoor relative humidity on the infection risk of\nfive respiratory airborne viruses\n\nArticle Open access 07 July 2022\n\n### Aerodynamic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in two Wuhan hospitals\n\nArticle 27 April 2020\n\n### Size distribution and relationship of airborne SARS-CoV-2 RNA to indoor\naerosol in hospital ward environments\n\nArticle Open access 02 March 2023\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe inhalation of respiratory aerosol containing the severe acute respiratory\nsyndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as an important route\nof transmission in the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)^1. As for\nall respiratory viral infections, a sufficient viral dose must be delivered to\nthe respiratory system of an uninfected individual for disease transmission to\noccur. For COVID-19, this equates to inhalation of a sufficient quantity of\naerosolized/inhalable and infectious SARS-CoV-2 viral particles. The minimal\ninfectious dose is a function of many parameters, such as mucosal immunity^2,\nprior infection^3, and immunization status^4. Regardless of the infectious\ndose required, the cumulative viral load of the air inhaled will necessarily\ncorrelate with the overall risk. Thus, understanding how environmental factors\naffect the aerosolized viral load over time will contribute to the assessment\nof the risk of transmission.\n\nAt their core, many of the non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented to\nmitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmission are centered on the removal of\ninfectious aerosolized virus from a given space. The aerosolized viral load\nmay be altered physically by lowering the number of virus-containing\nparticles. For example, changing aerosol production rates (e.g., via lowering\nthe volume of singing or talking)^5,6, crowding/social distancing policies^7,\nmask wearing^8, and improved ventilation^9 all reduce the total number of\nvirus-containing aerosol droplets. The viral load within aerosol droplets may\nalso be altered, so that the infectivity of the viral particles themselves is\nchanged through processes such as UV germicidal irradiation^10 or by\nadjustments to environmental conditions such as relative humidity (RH)^11 or\ntemperature^12. In addition to these intentional methods of disinfection,\naerosolized viruses are known to lose their infectivity over time, although\nthe precise mechanisms driving this loss remain the subject of much debate^13.\nA comprehensive understanding of all these processes/conditions, as well as\nthe interconnections between them, is necessary to facilitate the development\nof more effective mitigation strategies.\n\nWhile many of the unique properties of aerosol have been hypothesized to play\na role in the loss of viral infectivity, we have reported recently that a high\npH (alkaline, pH > 10) in respiratory aerosol surrogates is a significant\ncontributor driving its loss^14,15. The high pH reached by respiratory aerosol\nis a consequence of the mucosal liquids from which it originates (e.g.,\nsaliva, lung fluid) which contain elevated levels of bicarbonate^16. Following\ndroplet generation, the pH of the neutral droplet begins to rise as the\nbicarbonate evaporates from the droplet in the form of gaseous carbon dioxide\n(CO_2) (Eq. 1):\n\n$${H}_{\\left({aq}\\right)}^{+}+{{HCO}}_{3\\left({aq}\\right)}^{-}\\leftrightarrow\n{H}_{2}{{CO}}_{3\\left({aq}\\right)}\\leftrightarrow\n{{CO}}_{2\\left(g\\right)}+{H}_{2}O$$\n\n(1)\n\nThe maximum pH the aerosol achieves, as well as the time taken to reach it,\nare unclear and debated^17. Both are a function of numerous parameters\nincluding the RH, initial aerosol droplet size, aerosol equilibrium size,\ninitial bicarbonate concentration, and ambient CO_2 concentration ([CO_2(g)]).\nWhat is clear is that measurements of human exhaled aerosol^18,19,20 and\nsaliva^21 have both shown consistently that exhaled respiratory fluids are\nsignificantly more alkaline than the fluids within the respiratory tract from\nwhich they originate. Over longer time periods, the high pH of the aerosol may\nbe neutralized through exposure to trace acidic gases, another poorly defined\nprocess that requires more investigation^17. When compared to the vast\nmajority of environmental aerosol, this pH dynamic is a peculiarity of\nrespiratory aerosol and is critical for understanding the aerostability of\nrespiratory viruses.\n\nIf, as reported, the pH (alkalinity) of respiratory aerosol is a major driver\nin the loss of viral infectivity in the aerosol phase, it can be inferred that\n[CO_2(g)] has an effect on the aerostability of SARS-CoV-2 via the equilibrium\ndescribed in Eq. 1. This raises three questions: over what ambient\nconcentration range does CO_2(g) impact infectivity, to what degree is the\nviral infectivity decay profile affected by CO_2(g), and how does this change\nin infectivity affect overall risk of disease transmission?\n\nSince 2020, CO_2 monitors have become commonly used as an indicator of\npotential risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission as the [CO_2(g)] serves as a proxy\nfor overall ventilation efficiency and, thus, a predictor of total aerosol\nviral load. The source of both the aerosolized virus and CO_2 are the same\n(exhalation) and both are reduced through standard mitigation techniques such\nas ventilation^22, justifying the use of [CO_2(g)] as a proxy indicator of\ntransmission risk. We investigate here if elevated ambient levels of [CO_2(g)]\nadd a further factor to an increased transmission risk by altering the\naerostability of SARS-CoV-2. This is accomplished using the Controlled\nElectrodynamic Levitation and Extraction of Bioaerosol onto a Substrate\n(CELEBS)^14,15,23,24,25,26 to systematically explore the effects of\nenvironmental factors such as ambient [CO_2(g)] and RH on the aerostability of\nthe SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron variants of concern (VOC). The CELEBS is a\nnext-generation aerobiology technique that allows studies of changes in the\nviral infectivity within a small population of levitated droplets of a near\nidentical size and composition as a function of time, temperature, relative\nhumidity, and complete gas-phase composition. Additionally, viral decay from\n<5 s to hours can be readily measured with this technique. Finally, we\nestimate the effect of changes in the ambient [CO_2(g)] on the risk of\ntransmission using the established Wells-Riley model.\n\n## Results\n\n### The BA.2 omicron VOC is more aerostable than the delta VOC\n\nPreviously, we reported that the aerostability of the VOCs of SARS-CoV-2 (wild\ntype, Alpha, Beta, and Delta) correlated with the variant\u2019s stability in an\nalkaline growth medium over short-time periods (under five minutes)^15.\nSpecifically, it was reported that as the virus has evolved from wild type\nthrough to Delta VOC, it has become both more sensitive to high pH and less\naerostable. The relationship between pH and the aerostability of the (Omicron)\nBA.2 VOC is compared to the Delta VOC to further explore this comparison (Fig.\n1). Firstly, the aerostabilities of the Delta and BA.2 VOCs within aerosol\ndroplets are reported at moderate/low (40%) and high RH (90%) values in Fig.\n1a. At 40% RH, the Delta and BA.2 VOCs exhibit similar decay profiles. This is\nconsistent with our previous studies where all VOCs exhibited a similar decay\nprofile when the RH is below the droplet efflorescence threshold, highlighted\nby the near-instantaneous loss of ~50% of viral infectivity associated with\nthe efflorescence event. At 90% RH, the overall rate of decay of the BA.2 VOC\nis much slower than the Delta VOC. At 5 min, relative to the Delta VOC, the\ntotal viable aerosolized viral load of the BA.2 VOC is 1.7 times higher.\nExcluding data points in the transient decay (<1 min) to focus on the more\ngradual decay from 2 min onwards, our analysis reveals significant differences\nin infectivity between the Delta and BA.2 VOCs. At the 2 min time point, we\nobserve a statistically significant difference in the infectivity of the Delta\nand Omicron VOCs of 26 \u00b1 6 % (p = 3 \u00d7 10^\u22124, with 19.8 effective degrees of\nfreedom via Satterthwaite approximation) at 90% RH. This effect persists at\nthe 5 min mark, with a difference of 19 \u00b1 8 % (p = 0.03, with 18.9 degrees of\nfreedom). At 90% RH, the general structures of the decay profiles for both\nVOCs are consistent with previous VOCs, with an initial lag period of ~15 s,\nfollowed by a rapid loss to ~2 min, and a more gradual subsequent decay.\n\nFig. 1: Infectivity over time of the Delta and Omicron (BA.2) VOCs in aerosol\nand bulk solutions of high pH.\n\na Infectivity of the Delta and Omicron BA.2 VOCs that have been levitated at\nRHs of 40% and 90%. Data for 90% at times over 100 s are offset by 5 s to\nfacilitate reader interpretation. b, c Infectivity of BA.2 and Delta VOCs,\nrespectively, in DMEM 2% FBS bulk solution with pH maintained at 11 and\nmeasured by b cytopathy and c immunostaining. Values are means \u00b1 SE. Both b\nand c fit a first-order decay; from a t-test to compare slopes of regression\nlines (two-sided), the linear fits of ln(infectivity) vs. time for the Omicron\nand Delta VOCs are consistent with decay rates that are significant in their\ndifference p = 0.0002 (n = 24 (independent samples)) for (b), p = 0.027 (n =\n30 (independent samples)) for (c). Source data are provided as a Source Data\nfile.\n\nFull size image\n\nUnder high alkaline conditions in the bulk phase, the BA.2 VOC is found to be\nmore resistant to high pH conditions than the Delta VOC assessed via two\ndifferent measurements of infectivity (Fig. 1b, c). This is consistent with\nthe hypothesis that the differences between aerostability of the Delta and\nBA.2 VOCs are likely a consequence of their relative stability in a highly\nalkaline solution. BA.2 is the first VOC of SARS-CoV-2 that we have\ndemonstrated to have an increase in stability at high pH when compared to a\nprior VOC. The microbiological mechanisms underlying these differences in pH\nsensitivity remain unclear and are in need of further research.\n\nCollectively, the data shown in Fig. 1 support the hypothesis that high pH\nachieved in aerosol, with an initial composition that has high abundance of\nbicarbonate (such as saliva^27 and growth medium), is a major factor in\ndriving loss of viral infectivity in the aerosol phase^15. The implication of\nthis proposed mechanism is that any gaseous species (e.g., CO_2) that can\naffect aerosol pH is likely to impact viral infectivity.\n\n### SARS-CoV-2 aerostability correlates with the ambient concentration of gas-\nphase carbon dioxide\n\nIn poorly ventilated, occupied, indoor spaces, ambient [CO_2(g)] commonly\nreaches concentrations exceeding 2000 ppm^28 and can reach levels upwards of\n>5000 ppm in more crowded environments^29. The impact of elevated CO_2(g)\nlevels on the aerostability of SARS-CoV-2 is explored (Fig. 2). Both the\nsensitivity and the throughput of the CELEBS technique are dependent on the\ninitial viral load of the individual droplets. The maximum titer of the BA.2\nVOC that can be grown in the cell culture is approximately an order of\nmagnitude less than that of the Delta VOC. Thus, in order to explore the\neffect that [CO_2(g)] has on viral aerostability across a broad range of\nconditions and over long-time periods, the majority of the testing was\nconducted with the Delta VOC as it afforded a much higher measurement\nthroughput.\n\nFig. 2: Exploring the effect that [CO_2(g)] has on the aerostability of the\nDelta VOC as measured with the CELEBS.\n\na Infectivity of the Delta, Beta, and Omicron BA.2 VOCs as a function of\nambient concentrations of CO_2(g) at 90% RH, 120 s. Statistical significance\nwas assessed using a one-sided, two-sample equal variance, t-test (*p \u2264 0.05,\n**p \u2264 0.005, n = 146 (independent samples)). Specifically, the significance\n(p-value) between 500 ppm and 800 ppm, 1800 ppm, 3000 ppm, and 6500 ppm was\n0.003, 0.025, 0.032, and 0.001, respectively. b The effect that an elevated\nconcentration of CO2 has on the decay profile of the Delta VOC and original\nstrain of SARS-CoV-2 at 90% RH. Inset is simply a zoom-in of the first 5 min\nof the x-axis. Elevating the [CO_2(g)] results in a significant difference in\noverall decay assessed using a one-sided, two-sample equal variance, t-test (n\n= 188 (independent samples)) of the Delta VOC from 2 min onward, where the\nsignificance (p-value) was 0.007, 0.027, 0.020 and 0.005 for 2, 5, 10 and 40\nmin, respectively. c Relative infectivity of aerosolized Delta VOC exposed to\nincreased [CO_2(g)] as a function of time. The ratios were estimated using the\nraw data in Fig. 2b at time points where the infectivity was measured for both\n[CO2(g)]. Note that the error bars increase with time results from the\ninfectivity of the \u201cDelta, 500 ppm\u201d data set approaching zero which causes the\nrelative standard deviation to increase. d Infectivity of the Delta VOC\n(ln([A]/[Ao])) as a function of time in aerosol and in MEM at pH = 11 (bulk\ndata offset by \u22120.5). Least square fit through the Bulk data (R^2 = 0.995).\nValues are means \u00b1 SE. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\n\nFull size image\n\nWhen compared to a typical atmospheric [CO_2(g)] (~500 ppm), increasing the\n[CO_2(g)] to just 800 ppm results in a significant increase in viral\naerostability after 2 min (Delta VOC, Fig. 2a). No significant difference in\ninfectivity is observed between 800 ppm and 6500 ppm. It is notable that,\naccording to the UK Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), 800 ppm\n[CO_2(g)] has been identified as the level below which a room is determined to\nbe well-ventilated. When ambient airflow into the CELEBS is substituted with\nsynthetic air (0 ppm [CO_2(g)]), no change in virus aerostability is observed.\n\nIncreasing the [CO_2(g)] results in a significant increase in the\naerostability of both the Beta and Omicron BA.2 VOCs at 120 s. This suggests\nthat the viral aerostability is dependent on CO_2(g) concentration for all\nSARS-CoV-2 variants. The increase in infectivity of the Omicron variant due to\nthe elevated [CO_2] whilst similar, is slightly lower (+11.7%) than the Beta\n(+23.4%) and Delta (+36.8%) VOCs. This is likely a product of the differing pH\nsensitivities for different variants, with the more pH-sensitive variants more\nsensitive to changes in [CO_2]. It is unlikely a similar increase across\nvariants will occur at all time periods for all variants.\n\nThe rate of viral infectivity loss correlates with aerosol alkalinity.\nElevated [CO_2(g)] limits the amount of bicarbonate leaving the droplet (Eq.\n1) and, thus, limits the maximum pH that the droplet will reach. A significant\nimprovement in aerostability of SARS-CoV-2 resulting from elevated [CO_2(g)]\nwould be expected to increase over time as the droplet will spend less time at\nthe elevated pH^30. The effect of droplet exposure to elevated [CO_2(g)] over\nprolonged time periods on the infectious viral load is reported in Fig. 2b and\nit can be seen that elevated [CO_2(g)] had a considerable effect on the\noverall decay profile. Consider first the characteristics of the decay profile\nof the wild type SARS-CoV-2 in the aerosol phase above the efflorescence\npoint^14. From droplet generation until ~2 min, no loss of infectivity is\nobserved. After 2 min there is a rapid loss of infectivity over a moderate\ntime period (minutes), followed by a slower decay (tens of minutes). The\nprofile for the Delta VOC is similar but with the initial lag period shortened\nto ~15 s. In this case, when the [CO_2(g)] is elevated, the period of rapid\ndecay is absent or greatly abbreviated and the decay profile transitions\ndirectly from lag to a slow decay. As a result, the Delta VOC in elevated\n[CO_2(g)] is as aerostable as the wild type at 500 ppm CO_2 after 5 min,\nresulting in a larger fraction remaining infectious after 20 min (p = 0.04).\nIndeed, elevated [CO_2(g)] has a dramatic effect on the remaining relative\ninfectivity of SARS-CoV-2 over time (Fig. 2c). A hypothesis test regression of\nslope for the data in Fig. 2c found a p = 0.00038, consistent with a lower\nrate of viral decay at elevated [CO_2(g)]. After 40 min, approximately an\norder of magnitude more viral infectious particles remain viable in the\naerosol phase at elevated [CO_2(g)] when compared to the loss expected under\nambient (well-ventilated) conditions. This increase in the relative abundance\nof infectious particles is likely to result in increased risk of transmission\nof the infection.\n\nViral aerostability is often reported as having a half-life^31 with the decay\nassumed to follow first-order (exponential) reaction kinetics. This assumption\npresupposes that the mechanisms involved in infectivity loss do not change\nover time, even though the chemical composition and physical conditions inside\nan aerosol droplet vary over time. The appropriateness of making such\nassumptions is explored in Fig. 2d. In the bulk phase, the pH-driven decay\nfollows first-order kinetics. This is consistent with high [OH^\u2212] driving the\nloss of viral infectivity, with this concentration remaining constant over\ntime. However, the decay dynamics are markedly different in the aerosol phase\nwith the rate of loss slowing over time, and slowing more so at higher\n[CO_2(g)]. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the aerosol achieves\nhigh pH before being buffered towards a neutral pH by trace acidic vapor over\nlonger time periods (condensable carbonic acid in this case), regardless of\nRH. However, the decay rate is never found to increase over the entire time\nperiod studied, suggesting that the pH of the aerosol does not pass through\nneutral to become acidic during the time period when more than 95% of the\nviral infectivity is lost. Again, this is consistent with the condensation of\na weak acid, carbonic acid in this case. However, a half-life of ~80 min could\nbe estimated from the data falling between 20 and 40 min at [CO_2(g)] of 3000\nppm if one were to assume a first-order decay. This aligns with the half-lives\nreported using other measurement approaches in which the [CO_2(g)] is neither\nmeasured nor controlled^31.\n\nCollectively, the data shown in Fig. 2 show that the interplay between aerosol\nalkalinity and CO_2 has a profound effect on the overall aerostability of\nSARS-CoV-2. Any increase in [CO_2(g)] results in an increase in aerostability.\n\n### Depending on variant pH sensitivity, ambient [CO2] and solute composition\ncan affect viral aerostability more than relative humidity\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, many infections were traced to super-spreader\nevents^32, suggesting that transmission of the virus over longer distances was\npossible under some (as yet uncertain) conditions^1,33. Conversely, the\napparent effectiveness of mitigation strategies such as social distancing\nregulations^7, use of face shields/masks^34, and installation of plexiglass\nshields^35 suggests that SARS-CoV-2 was also commonly transmitted over short\ndistances. Thus, it is important to understand how environmental factors\naffect the aerostability of SARS-CoV-2 over time periods as short as 15 s.\n\nFixing the time in the aerosol phase at 15 s, the BA.2 VOC is found to be more\naerostable than the Delta VOC across a broad range of RH (Fig. 3a).\nEffectively, during the first 15 s post-aerosol generation there is no loss of\ninfectivity of the BA.2 VOC when the RH is above the efflorescence point of\nthe particle (RH~50%). Below that, the characteristic rapid loss of\napproximately half of the viral infectivity is observed, a consequence of the\nefflorescence event. This is consistent with the loss observed for the other\nSARS-CoV-2 VOCs we have studied^14,15,36 as well as for mouse hepatitis virus\n(MHV), another coronavirus^37. At an RH between ~50% and 80%, the Delta VOC is\nless aerostable than the other VOCs studied, rapidly losing over half of its\ninfectivity within 15 s of aerosolization. Collectively, the data in Fig. 3a\nshow that the initial decay of the Delta VOC is largely RH independent, while\nthe initial decay of the BA.2 VOC is highly RH-dependent.\n\nFig. 3: Infectivity of the Delta and Omicron VOCs across a range of RH and\nCO_2(g) concentrations.\n\na Infectivity of the Delta and Omicron BA.2 variants at 15 s in ambient air as\na function of relative humidity. b Infectivity of the Delta variant at 15 s as\na function of relative humidity and [CO_2(g)]. Values are means \u00b1 SE. A two-\nway ANOVA of the data in (b) indicated that both CO_2(g) and RH are\nsignificant factors in predicting infectivity, but do not interact, meaning\nthe effect of CO_2(g) is similar at different RHs (all 80% and below).\nP-values: RH 0.016, CO_2(g) < 0.0001, n = 169 (independent samples). Source\ndata are provided as a Source Data file.\n\nFull size image\n\nGiven that the BA.2 VOC is more robust than the Delta VOC over the 15 s time\nperiod, the impact of [CO_2(g)] and [NaCl] on the aerostability of the Delta\nVOC have been explored further. The effect that a moderate increase in\n[CO_2(g)] has on the aerostability of this SARS-CoV-2 VOC is reported in Fig.\n3b. Regardless of RH, increasing the [CO_2(g)] will drive the pH of an\nalkaline respiratory droplet towards neutral to some degree. As a result, at\nan RH of 80% and below, moderate increases in the [CO_2(g)] are shown to\nincrease viral aerostability. This increase in [CO_2(g)] results in a doubling\nof the remaining aerosolized viral load after 15 s for all RH < 80%. Pooling\nthe three datasets for RH < 80%, we verified these differences were\nstatistically significant by performing a two-sample t-test (p = 5 \u00d7 10^\u2212^4,\nwith 27.5 effective degrees of freedom). At 90% RH, no viral decay was\nmeasured (Fig. 3a, b); droplets injected into an RH of 90% are still\nevaporating at 15 s and, thus, the conditions in the droplet are not\nsufficiently different to affect viral infectivity.\n\n### Risk of transmission is highly affected by ambient concentrations of CO2\n\nThe dependence of the overall risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission on the explicit\ndecay dynamics inferred from measurements with the CELEBS technique has been\ninvestigated using a Wells-Riley model^38. Specifically, the impact of\nenvironmental factors such as [CO_2(g)] and humidity on the likelihood of\ndisease transmission have been explored. The Wells-Riley model is based on\ntransmitted quanta that inherently assume a uniformity in a mixed room, only\nstrictly true for small particles in the bronchiolar and laryngeal modes, both\n<5 \u03bcm diameter. The decay data measured in this study are for droplet sizes in\nthe oral mode (initially >50 \u03bcm diameter). We use the infectivity decay data\nfrom these large droplet measurements to inform estimates of transmission risk\nfor the small aerosol fraction and estimate the relative changes in risk that\nresult from changes in [CO_2(g)]. It should be noted that the rate of pH\nreduction will be dependent on both droplet size and total acid content in the\nair, where smaller droplets will be neutralized at a faster rate. The effect\nof size was explored in this study to a limited degree and was found to have a\nminimal effect within the size range explored (Supplementary Fig. 6). The\nprecise degree to which the droplet size affects the rate of neutralization\n(and subsequent increased viral aerostability) should be measured in the\nfuture.\n\nTypically, models assume that the aerosolized viral decay has a half-life of\n1.1 h^39 when estimating the risk of COVID-19 transmission, a rate of decay\nwhich is negligible when compared to the effects of even the poorest\nventilation. As shown in Fig. 1, viral decay dynamics are more complex than\nthe assumed single exponential decay. To be clear, the rapid early decay in\ninfectivity of aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 we report here, as well as\npreviously^14, does not contradict the consensus opinion that airborne\ntransmission prevails as the dominant mode of transmission. Our objective here\nis to demonstrate that the decay dynamics reported in Fig. 1a, b are actually\nconsistent with this consensus, especially in indoor environments. We\ntherefore focus on the limit of a well-mixed indoor environment using the\nWells-Riley framework and using our refined characterization of the\ninfectivity decay rate.\n\nCentral to the Wells-Riley approach is the number of infectious units\n(\u201cquanta\u201d) that remain active in a room. In a ventilated environment, the\nprobability that an aerosolized unit remains in the room after some time is\ndescribed by Equation 2.\n\n$${p}_{{active}}=1-\\exp \\left(\\frac{-t}{{\\tau }_{{vent}}}\\right)$$\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \\\\({\\tau }_{{vent}}\\\\) is the characteristic time to cycle air in the\nroom. We consider typical ventilation rates for \\\\({\\tau }_{{vent}}^{-1}\\\\) in\nthe range 0.5\u20138 h^\u2212^1 with smaller numbers indicating a poorly ventilated\nspace^40. Any effect of droplet removal by deposition which may occur for\ncoarser droplets is ignored. The fraction of droplets remaining viable to\ninitiate infection is \\\\({p}_{{active}}I\\\\), where I is their infectivity.\nInitially, we consider a fully recirculating ventilation system where the\n[CO_2(g)] remains constant so that we can assume the decay in infectivity\ndirectly follows that reported from the CELEBS data; this set-up models a\nclosed Heating, Ventilation and Air-Condition (HVAC) system. We assume the\nHVAC system perfectly filters the air of aerosol droplets, although this is a\ncrude oversimplification^41. Later we will allow for varying [CO_2(g)] in\norder to model ventilation and mixing with an outdoor air source (from e.g.,\nopening a window). For convenience, we fit the CELEBS data (Fig. 1a,b) with\ntwo exponentially decaying functions (details in Supplementary). In poorly\nventilated environments, the viability of aerosolized virus is dominated by\nthe intrinsic decay in infectivity (Fig. 4a). Air recirculation dominates in\nbetter-conditioned environments leading to convergence of the long-time decay\n(Fig. 4b). We compare these model predictions with a simple exponentially\ndecaying infectivity with the widely assumed aerosolized half-life of 1.1 h^31\nfrom drum data.\n\nFig. 4: Numerical modeling of risk of indoor transmission in a 300 m^3\nclassroom that combines fits of infectivity data from Figs. 1\u20133 with the\nWells-Riley model for airborne transmission of the Delta VOC in a well-mixed\nenvironment.\n\nFraction of infectious aerosol particles remaining in the a poorly ventilated\n(0.5 air changes per hour) and b well-ventilated (8 air changes per hour)\nclassroom where \u201cTime\u201d is the time following exhalation of the infectious\naerosol. Probability of onward transmission to a susceptible individual\nassuming a well-mixed c poorly ventilated (0.5 air changes per hour) and d\nwell-ventilated (8 air changes per hour) environment, where \u201cTime\u201d is the time\nfollowing occupation of the room. An infectious quanta production rate of\n0.1s-1 is assumed (38). Decay profile in (a, b) is used to model the\ntransmission risk in (c, d).\n\nFull size image\n\nIn the Wells-Riley model, the infection probability \\\\({p}_{I}\\\\) is assumed\nto depend exponentially on the number of infectious units (\u201cquanta\u201d) received\n\\\\(n\\\\), i.e. \\\\({p}_{I}\\left(t\\right)=1-\\exp\n\\left(-n\\left(t\\right)\\right)\\\\). This exponential dose-response relationship\nis essentially a consequence of the independent action hypothesis^42. The\nnumber of quanta n describes the number of infectious viral doses received,\nincorporating the effects of viral viability and ventilation. The typical\nnumber of quanta received increases linearly in time \\\\(t\\\\) as\n\\\\(n\\left(t\\right)=c\\dot{V}t\\\\) where c is the concentration of quanta in the\nwell-mixed air and \\\\(\\dot{V}\\\\) is the minute volume of exhaled air (from\nbreathing) which we take to be 7.5 L/min. The steady-state quanta\nconcentration is found where \\\\({p}_{{active}}I\\\\) balances the rate that\ninfectious quanta are produced and released into the environment (details in\nSupplementary). For illustration purposes, we consider a 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 3 = 300 m^3\nclassroom with up to 40 occupants where there is a single infected individual.\nThe quanta production rate by an infected individual is considered to be in\nthe range 0.01\u20130.1 s^\u2212^1 for SARS-CoV-2^39. We assume a value of 0.1 s^\u2212^1 for\nillustrative purposes, with the understanding that this factor remains a major\nsource of uncertainty in transmission models. The probability of onward\ntransmission in a poorly ventilated classroom is similar for all datasets at\nlow [CO_2(g)] (Fig. 4c, blue and black lines) because only the long-time\nbehavior matters in this well-mixed limit. By contrast, the probability of\nonward transmission rises much more rapidly for the high [CO_2(g)] (Fig 4, red\nlines). The amplifying effect of [CO_2(g)] is visible but less pronounced in a\nspace with good ventilation using, e.g., an open window (Fig. 4d). The\nprobability of transmission is sensitive to parameters with large\nuncertainties like the quanta production rate, so the absolute values of\ntransmission probability in Fig. 4c, d should not be taken literally. Rather,\nthe important point is that the relative difference in probability between low\n[CO_2(g)] and high [CO_2(g)] can be striking; even with good ventilation (Fig.\n4d), the probability of onward transmission approximately doubles for\n[CO_2(g)] = 3000 ppm over the [CO_2(g)] = 500 ppm after ~15 min of exposure.\n\nFor risk management, we must consider the risk that any susceptible individual\nbecomes infected, rather than just a single individual. The probability that\nat least one individual becomes infected is:\n\n$$1-{\\left(1-{p}_{I}\\left(t\\right)\\right)}^{N-1}$$\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \\\\(N\\\\) is the room occupancy. As a measure of risk, we invert this\nrelationship to determine the length of time the classroom space can be shared\nuntil there is a 50% chance that secondary transmission has occurred. The\nprobability of a successful transmission (assuming a well-mixed environment)\nas a function of viral aerostability and ventilation is explored in Fig. 5.\nEstimates for the Delta variant at high [CO_2(g)] are comparable in magnitude\nto predictions with a decay time assumed from the drum studies. By contrast,\nthe effect of increased [CO_2(g)] has a profound effect on the overall risk of\ntransmission. Even in well-ventilated classrooms with 10 air changes per hour\n(in a recirculating system), we see that the time before an expected\ntransmission occurs is approximately halved by raising the [CO_2(g)].\n\nFig. 5: Time until there is a 50% chance that at least one susceptible person\nwill have become infected in an occupied classroom containing a single\ninfected individual, where the viral decay rate is dictated by the RH and\n[CO_2(g)] in the replacement air.\n\nWe combine estimates of the [CO_2(g)] in the room with interpolations of the\ndatasets for Delta variant\u2019s infectivity at 90% RH to estimate the risk when\nexchanging with outdoor air (black, 40% RH, 450 ppm [CO_2(g)]). This\ninterpolation is purely intended to illustrate the nonlinear role of\nventilation qualitatively, and so these numbers should not be taken literally.\nFor comparison we also show the expectation at fixed low (purple) and high\n(orange) [CO_2(g)] without any interpolation; this models recirculation flow\nwithin a HVAC system. The number of occupants is varied a 20, b 30, and c 40.\nAn infectious quanta production rate of 0.1s-1 is assumed.\n\nFull size image\n\nSustained [CO_2(g)] at a higher concentration at a fixed ventilation rate\n(e.g., more recirculation of room air and less mixing of fresh air) implies\nlower aerosol pH, greater survival, and shorter time until 50% transmission.\nAssuming a slower decay rate consistent with the drum data does not\nincorporate the rapid initial loss of infectivity which means, at the same\nquanta emission rate, there is more infectious virus and shorter time to reach\n50% infectivity. Outdoor air lowers the CO_2 concentration, ensuring the pH\nremains higher, leading to lower infectivity and longer time to reach same\ninfectivity as ACH goes up.\n\nDespite the rapid initial decay (Fig. 1a, b), the Wells-Riley model prediction\nestimates that long-distance transmission is possible. However, the Wells-\nRiley model neglects the short-time decay indicating that short-range airborne\ntransmission route (from e.g., direct conversation) may be underestimated in\nthese conventional approaches. Collectively, the risk estimations from the\nWells-Riley model demonstrate the importance of ventilation in mitigating risk\nas it addresses aerosolized viral load on two fronts: firstly, the rate of\nloss of viral infectivity in the aerosol phase (e.g., lower [CO_2(g)]\nincreases decay rate) and, secondly, the physical reduction of the number of\nviral containing particles (e.g., displaced from the room). The Wells-Riley\nmodel demonstrates the importance of [CO_2(g)] and RH on long-distance\ntransmission risk. In the future, the effect the rapid loss of infectivity in\nthe aerosol phase at low RH has on short-distance transmission risk should be\nexplored using a CFD model.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn the absence of infectious virus sampling, ambient [CO_2(g)] has been shown\nto indicate increased COVID-19 infection risk through a reduction in effective\nventilation and an increase in infectious particle concentrations^43. The data\npresented here suggests that [CO_2(g)] concentration may be more than just an\nindicator of poor ventilation or air filtration efficiency. Ultimately the\naerosolized virus and CO_2 have the same origin, and their mutual interaction\nincreases the overall risk (Fig. 5). This means that the utility of [CO_2(g)]\nas a proxy for transmission is of increased value as increased [CO_2(g)]\nitself may increase the likelihood of successful transmission by increasing\nviral viability.\n\n### Broader implications\n\nThe ability of [CO_2(g)] to affect virus aerostability may have broader\nimplications beyond disease transmission and prompts many new avenues of\nresearch. For example, the aerostability of a virus being affected by the\n[CO_2(g)] raises many questions regarding the potential effect that increases\nin the [CO_2(g)] in the atmosphere has on both the transmissibility of extant\nviruses, as well as on the emergence of novel viruses. [CO_2(g)] has increased\nfrom the preindustrial revolution (275 ppm), through to now (~400 ppm), and\nmay reach upwards of >1000 ppm by the turn of the century^44. This increase\nmay be enough to improve viral transmission through both increasing the\naerostability of the virus outdoors (Fig. 2a), but also increasing the\nbaseline [CO_2(g)] indoors as well. The degree to which [CO_2(g)] plays a role\nin disease transmission via changes in aerostability specifically needs to be\nexplored further across a range of conditions and particle types.\n\nRespiratory viral infections, such as influenza and rotavirus, are notable as\nthey have a seasonality^45. There are numerous hypotheses as to what drives\nthis process including, for example, that the dry indoor air over winter may\nhave an effect^46,47. The effect of RH may also be important with regards to\nprocesses such as mucosal immunity^2,48 and plume dynamics^49, and less so for\nviral infectivity. Seasonal variation in indoor [CO_2(g)] occurs globally,\nacross a broad range of geographies^50,51,52. From the experimental and model\ndata reported here, we hypothesize that the seasonality of respiratory viral\ninfections at the population level may be affected by indoor [CO_2(g)] as well\nas changes in RH. Further study is needed to explore this relationship across\na broad range of respiratory viruses within respiratory particles of various\nsizes and compositions.\n\nModerate increases in [CO_2(g)] (from 500 to 800 ppm) affecting the\naerostability of SARS-CoV-2 have very broad implications with regard to how\nall previously published aerovirology experiments should be interpreted.\nStandard experiments involve the nebulization of a virus-containing starting\nformulation into a confined volume where the aerosol is suspended. The\nstarting formulation will contain some level of bicarbonate, either from the\ngrowth medium in which the virus is made, or because the starting formulation\nis some form of respiratory fluid. If the starting formulation does not have\nbicarbonate, the utility of the data is questionable as the starting\nformulation is missing a critical component that is both driving the loss of\nviral infectivity in respiratory aerosol and necessarily a part of the\nrespiratory system of mammals. The presence of bicarbonate in the starting\nformulation necessitates that CO_2 must be produced during the nebulization\nprocess, and there is no physical means to separate the aerosol condensed\nphase from the gas phase. The amount of CO_2 produced will depend on the\namount of sample nebulized and has been reported to be greater than the 800\nppm to improve viral aerostability^14. It is notable that of the five\npublications that have reported the decay rate of the original variant of\nSARS-CoV-2^11,31,53,54,55, only two provided enough information to estimate\nthe total mass of the sample nebulized, while none reported the [CO_2(g)].\nAccordingly, in the study of aerosolized viruses, a major parameter that\naffects viral aerostability (CO_2) is simultaneously intrinsic in the\nexperiment, and not considered.\n\nThe decay rate of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosol as measured with a rotating drum, or\nsimilar closed system in which the sample is nebulized and the subsequent\nplume captured, is reported as a half-life of ~1.1 h^10,11,31. This matches\nwith the half-life reported in this study when the [CO_2(g)] was elevated\n(Fig. 2d, after 20 min). Direct confirmation of this is not possible as the\n[CO_2(g)] in rotating drum studies has never been reported. In the absence of\nelevated [CO_2(g)], the half-life as measured with the CELEBS for any of the\nSARS-CoV-2 VOCs is <20 min. The ability for moderate increases in [CO_2(g)] to\ndramatically increase the aerostability of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2a) largely\nexplains the discrepancy between the aerostability reported using the CELEBS-\nsystem with those reported previously using nebulized-based instruments.\n\n### SARS-CoV-2 has a triphasic decay profile\n\nThe high time resolution of the CELEBS technology has afforded unique insights\ninto the decay dynamics of aerosolized viruses that have been previously\nimpossible. Historically, the decay of an aerosolized virus has been described\nas having a half-life. As shown here and in previous studies^14,15,26, this is\nclearly not the case (Fig. 2d). Rather, the decay profile is a complex process\nthat is highly dependent on both microbiology and aerosol dynamics. From our\nstudies using this next-generation technology, we have found that there are 3\ndistinct phases of aerosolized viral decay: the Lag Phase, the Dynamic Phase,\nand the Slow Decay Phase as shown schematically in Fig. 6.\n\nFirst is the \u201cLag Phase\u201d. During this phase, the conditions in the droplet are\nin flux (i.e., CO_2 evaporation, water evaporation, solute concentration), but\nthe conditions are such that they are not yet toxic to the viral particle. The\nlength of the Lag Phase is highly RH (Fig. 3a), temperature, [CO_2(g)] (Fig.\n3b), and variant dependent (Fig. 2b). At low RH, the Lag Phase is very short\n(<5 s) since droplet efflorescence will initiate rapid loss of viral\ninfectivity (Fig. 6a). At high RH, the pH of the droplet increases during the\nLag Phase, thus the time before the virus begins to decay is dependent on how\nsensitive the virus is to pH (Figs. 1a and 3a), and the speed at which the\naerosol pH rises (Fig. 3b), a process that may take on the order of minutes.\nThe wild type SARS-CoV-2 had a 2 min Lag Period. The virus was readily able to\nsurvive the rapid increase in salt concentration that took place over the\nfirst 20\u201330 s of aerosolization. Viral decay did not begin until the pH level\nhad considerably increased when it began to drive the loss of infectivity\n(Fig. 6d). It is likely that the increase in salt concentration plays a role\nin further increasing the rate of viral inactivation, but we suggest that the\nchange in salt concentration alone is not the primary driving force based on\nthe length of the Lag Period relative to the evaporation rate. The interplay\nbetween these two processes on viral stability needs to be explored further.\n\nFig. 6: Summary of the Triphasic Viral Aerosol Decay (TVAD) profile of\nrespiratory aerosol.\n\nThe general regions of the viral decay are indicated in (a) and (b), and are\ngoverned by the conditions in the droplet (c). The three phases are the \u201cLag\nPhase\u201d, the \u201cDynamic Phase\u201d and the \u201cSlow Decay Phase\u201d. Conditions in the\ndroplet (c) are estimates for a respiratory droplet injected into 90% RH at\n500 ppm [CO_2(g)] based upon previously published reports (14). The dynamics\nof the TVAD are governed by the virus\u2019s sensitivity to pH of the aerosol (d);\ndata from previous study 14; values are means \u00b1 SE (n = 24 (independent\nsamples)).\n\nFull size image\n\nAfter the Lag Phase, the conditions in the droplet are still in flux, while\nthe pH increase is still occurring. The second phase of decay is the \u201cDynamic\nPhase\u201d phase. In this phase, the pH in the droplet has changed to the point\nwhere it has become toxic to the virus and the rate of loss is dictated by the\nchanging conditions in the droplet. For example, the rapid loss of infectivity\nduring efflorescence may occur in the Dynamic Phase. In the dynamic phase, the\nmore susceptible fraction of the viral population will be inactivated.\n\nThe final phase is the \u201cSlow Decay Phase\u201d phase where the loss of viral\ninfectivity is much slower than the Dynamic Phase. The Slow Decay Phase\ncontinues until all viral infectivity is lost, which may take tens of minutes\nto hours, depending on the virus and environmental conditions. The mechanism\nof the slower decay rate in this phase remains unclear and may be biological\n(e.g., fraction of strain being more resilient to the conditions) or\nphysical/chemical (e.g., the remaining virus protected by its immediate\nlocation such as in a liposome or associated with a protein^26). The length of\nthe Lag Period and the rate of loss in the Dynamic Phase are both highly\ndependent on the pH sensitivity of the virus as well as [CO_2(g)] and RH. At a\nhigh [CO_2(g)], the Dynamic Phase can be dramatically truncated or even\neliminated entirely (Fig. 2b). The decay rate in the Slow Decay Phase is\nlargely RH independent, but highly dependent on the [CO_2] (Figs. 2a, b, d and\n3b). The data collected using closed systems, such as a Goldberg drum, largely\nmiss the Lag and Dynamic phases (perhaps catching the tail end of the Dynamic\nPhase) and measure primarily in the Slow Decay Phase. Moreover, the rate of\nloss in the Slow Decay Phase is highly [CO_2(g)] dependent (Figs. 2a, b, d, 3b\nand Supplementary Fig. 7).\n\nThe Triphasic Viral Aerosol Decay (TVAD) profile accurately describes the\ngeneral relationship between viral infectivity and aerosolization time. The\napplicability of the TVAD to all other respiratory viruses is unconfirmed,\nthough it is notable that we have observed similar behavior for the MHV virus\nand all VOC for SARS-CoV-2^14,26,37. TVAD provides a framework to understand\nand explore which properties of the viral particle or the aerosol droplet will\naffect the likelihood of both short and long-distance transmission. The\nparameters that affect the Lag and Dynamic phases may affect short-distance\ntransmission while the parameters that effect the Slow Decay Phase may affect\nlong-distance transmission.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Cell culture and virus growth\n\nVero E6 cells modified to stably express TMPRSS2 (Vero E6/TMPRSS2 cell,\nobtained from NIBSC, UK) and Vero E6 cells modified to stably express human\nACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Vero E6/ACE2/TMPRSS2 (VAT) cells (25)) are cultured in\nDulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, high glucose; Sigma, UK) supplemented\nwith 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma) at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO_2(g), 100 units/ml\npenicillin (Gibco, UK), 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin (Gibco, UK), and L-glutamine\n(Gibco, UK).\n\nViral stocks of the B.1.617.2 (Delta) (GISAID ID: EPI_ISL_1731019) and Omicron\n(BA.2) VOCs are prepared using VAT cells grown to confluence in T75 flasks.\nThe cells are infected at different multiplicities of infection (MOI) of 0.01\nand 0.1 and the infected cells grown in Eagle\u2019s Minimal Essential Medium (MEM)\nsupplemented with 2% FBS for either 24-h (for Delta) or 72-h (for BA.2) post-\ninfection for virus production. After the incubation (37 \u00b0C, 5% CO_2) period,\nthe culture supernatant is collected, centrifuged (250 g, 10 min), filtered\n(0.22 \u03bcm), aliquoted and frozen (\u221280 \u00b0C). The Delta VOC (TCID_50/mL of 3.4 \u00d7\n10^7) grows to a higher titer than the BA.2 VOC (TCID_50/mL of 3.1 \u00d7 10^6).\n\n### CELEBS \u2013 airborne longevity measurements\n\nThe airborne stability of SARS-CoV-2 variants is measured using the CELEBS\ntechnique. This has been described in detail previously for the study of both\nbacterial^23,24 and viral species^14,26,37. Briefly, a starting formulation\ncontaining the virus is loaded into a droplet-on-demand dispenser. Depending\non the magnitude and pulse width used to activate the dispenser, the starting\nradius of the droplet is ~25 microns. The number of infectious viral units per\ndroplet is measured and found to be ~2.8 for the Delta VOC, ~0.3 for the\nOmicron BA.2, and ~0.5 for the Beta VOC. The final radius of the droplets will\ndepend on RH, droplet composition, and initial size; with regards to the\ndroplet compositions and sizes used in this study, our previous published work\nhas shown the final radius between 5 and 10 \u03bcm in our previous work^14. The\ndispenser is positioned near an induction electrode such that, during droplet\ngeneration, ion migration (e.g., Na^+) in the jet results in the production of\nan individual droplet with a slight net charge (<5fC from ion imbalance) when\nthe jet collapses. The individual droplets are then levitated by the\nelectrodynamic fields produced by the ring electrodes within the core of the\nCELEBS.\n\nA laminar airflow is passed over the region in which the droplets are\nlevitated such that the chemical composition, relative humidity, and\ntemperature of the air can be controlled and monitored. The sources of\ncompressed air used in the study were either CO_2-free compressed air (for\nexperiments where the concentration of CO_2 was set to 0 ppm) or compressed\nlaboratory air (Bambi Oil Free Compressor, Model VTS75D). The temperature and\nhumidity of the airflow passing over the levitated droplets was measured using\na Honeywell (HIH-4602-C Series) humidity sensor. The concentration of CO_2 in\nthe airflow was measured using a GSS ExplorIR-M Low Power CO_2 Sensor (range 0\nto 20,000 ppm, accurate within 70 ppm). After a set time period, ranging from\n<5 s through to 40 min, the electric fields are manipulated such that the\ndroplets are deposited into a Petri dish filled with 6 mL of DMEM containing\n2% FBS. Within 15 min post deposition (typically under 5 min), the 6 mL of\nvirus-containing medium is added in 100 \u03bcL aliquots to the central 60 wells\n(containing confluent Vero E6/TMPRSS2 cells) of a 96-well plate. After 3\u20135\ndays incubation (in 37 \u00b0C, >99% RH, 5% CO_2), the number of wells showing the\ncharacteristic cytopathic effect (CPE) of SARS-CoV-2 are tabulated, and the\nnumber of viral particles that maintained their infectivity throughout the\nlevitation process is calculated as previously described^37. Each day, the\ninfectivity (Eq. 4) is normalized to the infectious units per droplet of those\nlevitated at 90% RH and <5 s (conditions under which no loss of viral\ninfectivity is seen), termed the time (T) = 0 point.\n\n$${{{{{\\rm{Infectivity}}}}}}=\\frac{{{{{{\\rm{Virus}}}}}}\\,{{{{{\\rm{per}}}}}}\\,{{{{{\\rm{Droplet}}}}}}({{{{{\\rm{Time}}}}}},{{{{{\\rm{RH}}}}}},[{{{{{\\rm{CO}}}}}}2])}{{{{{{\\rm{Virus}}}}}}\\,{{{{{\\rm{per}}}}}}\\,{{{{{\\rm{Droplet}}}}}}(\n< 5{{{{{\\rm{s}}}}}},90\\%,500{{{{{\\rm{ppm}}}}}})}$$\n\n(4)\n\nThe aerostability of different variants of SARS-CoV-2 are systematically\nmeasured across a broad range of environmental conditions (RH from 20% to 90%,\nCO_2 concentrations from 0 ppm to 6500 ppm) and time (from seconds to upwards\nof 40 min).\n\n### Droplet solute selection\n\nWe previously reported that the physicochemical properties of aerosol\nparticles composed of MEM and artificial saliva are similar (14, 15). As well\nas broad similarities in composition, these properties include the aerosol pH,\nwhich changes from neutral to >10 following generation (resulting from a\nsimilar initial bicarbonate concentration), as well as a variability in\nparticle phase and morphology when the RH is between the deliquescence (~75%)\nand efflorescence (~50%) RHs of the aerosol. For MEM, all aerosol particles\nare homogeneous liquids containing no precipitate above an RH of 85%, while\nall particles contain a large proportion of crystalline salt below 45% RH.\nIndeed, initially formed droplets of MEM and saliva have similar\nconcentrations of salts (to ensure a stable osmotic pressure for cell growth)\nand NaHCO_3 (because both are at equilibrium with ~5% CO_2). Thus, MEM can be\nconsidered a good proxy for saliva as they share the underlying\nphysicochemical properties that govern viral aerostability. Indeed, we have\nshown that the infectivity recorded at high and low RH and over the first 120\ns of levitation (enough time for the majority of the viral infectivity to be\nlost) there are not significant in their differences. As a consequence, MEM is\nused as the droplet medium in this study, and infectivity measurements were\nundertaken in conditions where the structure of the particles is known to be\nhomogeneous, specifically at RHs of 40% and 90%.\n\n### Bulk stability measurements\n\nThe stability of the Delta and BA.2 variants in bulk solutions is assessed\neither by TCID_50 assay detection of infectious virus or by immunostaining. In\nthe TCID_50 assay, the virus stock is first diluted 1 in 10,000 in DMEM with\n2% FBS which is adjusted to a pH of 11 with NaOH. After a set incubation\nperiod at 20 \u00b0C in the open air, the sample is then serially diluted into\nneutral DMEM containing 2% FBS, and the TCID_50/ml of each sample is then\nmeasured. For all samples, the TCID_50/ml is normalized to a sample that is\nnot exposed to a change in the growth medium pH.\n\nIn the immunostaining approach, the virus stock is diluted 1:40 in DMEM with\n2% FBS (pH 11). After a set incubation period, the sample is then diluted 1:15\nin DMEM with 2% FBS (pH 7.0). 100 \u03bcL of the diluted virus is then added to the\nwell of a 96-well plate seeded with Vero E6/TMPRSS2 cells the day prior. After\nan 18 h incubation (37 \u00b0C, 5% CO_2), the cells are fixed in 4% (v/v)\nparaformaldehyde for 60 min. Fixed cells are then permeabilized (0.1%\nTriton-X100 in PBS) and blocked (1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) prior to being\nstained with a monoclonal antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein\n(N) (1:2000 dilution; 200-401-A50, Rockland) followed by an appropriate Alexa\nFluor-conjugated secondary antibody (ThermoFisher) and DAPI (Sigma Aldrich).\nImages of the wells are collected (ImageExpress Pico automated imaging\nplatform^15), and the number of infected cells tabulated.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nError bars provided in the figures are reporting standard error. Significance\nwas measured using a two-sample t-test with equal variance, where the p-values\nare reported as being less than 0.5, 0.05, or 0.005. When multiple variables\nwere explored, a two-way ANOVA was used to assess the interaction between them\n(e.g., effect of [CO_2(g)] and RH on aerostability).\n\n### Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio\nReporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\n\nThe data generated in this study are provided in the Supplementary Information\nand the Source Data file.
