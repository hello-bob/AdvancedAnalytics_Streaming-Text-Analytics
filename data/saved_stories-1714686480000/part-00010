While\nGottlieb\u2019s thinking about marriage feels especially dated in this spring of\npolyamory and modern love, I have been thinking about applying Gottlieb\u2019s\ngeneral thesis \u2014 don\u2019t shoot for perfection; go for good enough \u2014 when it\ncomes to public schools.\n\nI was recently at a small, retreat-ish conference where another attendee came\nfrom the Philadelphia area. I asked her where she lived, and she replied,\n\u201cBryn Mawr. For the schools.\u201d She might not have even said \u201cFor the\u201d part; she\nmight have just said \u201cthe schools,\u201d or \u201cYou know, the schools.\u201d The point was:\nThat people live in certain towns for the schools is unquestioned, passed down\nfrom generation to the next like received wisdom. But why?\n\nLater, in a car ride back from a hike with other conference attendees, public\nschools came up again. I explained how \u201cthe schools\u201d comment bothered me and\nsaid something like I wished that people would worry less about the quality of\npublic schools and just send their kids to their neighborhood school.\n\nOne attendee then told me about a public school right near him in Washington,\nD.C. where he\u2019d witnessed high school students doing bad stuff \u2014 throwing\nbricks, breaking into cars, and causing other kinds of trouble, as I recall.\nWas this the kind of school I suggested children attend? Another person\ninterjected that many kids need more attention than 30-person classes at\npublic school can provide, and it\u2019s all about finding the right fit for your\nkid. I agreed with that and shut my mouth.\n\nSaved By The Bell\u2018s fantasy high school\n\nBut I\u2019m a writer, not much of a speaker, and so here\u2019s what I should have\nsaid: There\u2019s a big range between schools where kids openly commit crimes on a\nfrequent basis and the kind of schools where people rearrange their lives to\nlive near them. That range includes what I\u2019d call \u201cgood enough\u201d schools \u2014\nwhich are completely absent from the big conversations we\u2019re having ad nauseam\nabout parenting, about childhood anxiety, about inequality and segregation in\nour cities. These schools don\u2019t have to be for everyone; they don\u2019t have to be\nthe right school for the entirety of K-12, but I think they could work for\nmore families if parents would just question the general premise that mediocre\nschools aren\u2019t good enough.\n\n\u201cGood enough\u201d schools are the ones that get somewhere between a 3 and 5 on\nGreatSchools.org. These are schools that do nothing for the local housing\nmarket, and therefore you can buy a relatively affordable house nearby and\nwalk your kid to school. Your child will not need an Apple watch or a Stanley\nwater mug to attend these schools, nor will your child develop an anxiety\ndisorder from a need to succeed in these schools. The test scores are\ngenerally a bit (or a lot) below average in these schools. These are schools\nwhere the teachers are well aware of people on the bottom rung, and so you\nwill be frustrated that they teach to the bottom of the class, but you will be\ngrateful that you pay almost nothing for aftercare until 6pm each day.\n\nJust a picture of a teenage water influencer\n\nAs we know, we live in hyper-competitive times. So now there\u2019s pushback on\nhelicopter parents who are slavishly attentive and protective of their kids in\na bid to help them succeed. But why isn\u2019t there any pushback on this extremely\ncommon pattern of parents slavishly rearranging their lives to live close to\ntheir region\u2019s best public schools? Why don\u2019t we see that the over-\nprotectionist tendencies that prevent parents from letting their kids play\noutside are driven by the same kind of fear of letting their kids go to\nschools where there are a lot of kids from poor families who did not spend\ntheir preschool years practicing handwriting and learning to read?\n\nGetting back to Gottlieb: Her ideas about Mr. Good Enough could be thought of\nanother way. Everything is subject to the laws of diminishing returns. So much\nof life these days among the professional class is about optimizing and\nmaximizing and trying for the best, ignoring the fact that shooting for \u201cgood\nenough\u201d is actually the most efficient and effective way to live. Yes, the\nschools in Bryn Mawr are better \u2014 but to what degree? And is better actually\nbetter?\n\nEver since the 1950s when Dr. Donald Winnicott coined the idea of being a\n\u201cgood enough parent,\u201d we\u2019ve known that being perfect as a parent is actually\ncounterproductive. Here\u2019s a bit about Winnicott\u2019s theory of parenting from a\nWikipedia page on the parenting style:\n\nA key function of good enough parenting is to provide the essential background\nto allow for the growing child\u2019s disillusionment with the parents and the\nworld, without destroying their appetite for life and ability to accept\n(external and internal) reality.\n\nThought of this way, a good enough school might do a better job of preparing\nyour child for their eventual disillusionment with \u2014 and necessary coping with\n\u2014 American life these days.\n\nYou might wonder why I care about what another family chooses to do for their\nkid\u2019s schooling. Unfortunately, other families consistently choosing to move\nout of cities to the suburbs \u201cfor the schools\u201d depletes city schools from\nhaving high-income and highly educated families in the system (except those\nthat move to the best city public schools!). The result is that we have\nextremely segregated schools, partly in terms of race but even more so in\nterms of income, which is a problem given that economic diversity has been\nproven to benefit everyone, particularly the lowest income learners.\n\nTo solve this, many cities have sought to help public schools compete with\nhigh-quality suburban ones. But because there\u2019s often just a few of these\nsought-after, high-performing urban public schools, they\u2019re putting gas on the\nflames of our countrywide affordable housing crisis, segregation crisis and\nopportunity hoarding crisis.\n\nIn Philadelphia, housing prices in one of the \u201cbest\u201d school catchments, Penn\nAlexander, have seen extraordinary price appreciation ever since the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania gave funding and other supports to the school. And\nthe student body\u2019s demographics have changed from 57 percent Black when it\nopened in 2002 to just 12 percent Black in 2023, leading the daughter of the\nschool\u2019s namesake to tell The Philadelphia Inquirer:\n\nMy mother was a civil rights advocate, sat on the first civil rights committee\nthat President Truman put together, and fought for the lives and the ability\nof people who were marginalized to have access to the larger frills of\nsociety,\u201d said Alexander-Minter. Her mother would not approve of the relative\nlack of access to Penn Alexander for Black students and other marginalized\ngroups, she said.\n\nMaybe we could have integrated schools, where kids of all backgrounds mix, if\nwe just thought our neighborhood schools were good enough and didn\u2019t move to\nthe best catchments!\n\nI hear the parent who acknowledges how public school doesn\u2019t work for everyone\nand that you need to do what is best for your kid. As my younger child heads\ninto kindergarten next year, maybe we\u2019ll find this \u201cgood enough\u201d school isn\u2019t\nright for him. Maybe my older son won\u2019t love his school forever or seek out\nthe challenge of a magnet school when it comes time. The point isn\u2019t to make\nthis a solution for everyone, always and forever. The point here is to\nconsider the \u201cgood enough\u201d school as an option, to question why moving to \u201cthe\nschools\u201d is so often part and parcel of the American way, like off-street\nparking and single-use plastic.\n\nI\u2019ve kept an open mind to the idea of the \u201cgood enough\u201d school and I\u2019ll be\ngrateful to send my kids there for however many years it works out.\n\nDiana Lind is a writer and urban policy specialist.
