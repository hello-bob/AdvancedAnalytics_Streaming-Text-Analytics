A wide expanse\nof blue sky stretches above. Beneath, undulating green hills, sprawling\nhedgerows, a horizon broken only by the jagged tips of Wales\u2019 Cambrian\nmountain range. Sun-soaked goodness.\n\n\u201cCan you see that bumblebee working the clover?\u201d he asks, voice breathy with\nexertion. \u201cThe bird life, insects, butterflies, small mammals, and bats ...\nthe biodiversity of this place is unbelievable.\u201d This is all here, he says,\nbecause he\u2019s farming in harmony with nature.\n\nThe secret to this small oasis, Holden says, is the way he works his land. He\nis one of a growing number of farmers shaking off conventional methods and\nharnessing practices to rebuild soil health and fertility\u2014cover crops, minimal\ntilling, managed grazing, diverse crop rotations. It is a reverse revolution\nin some ways, taking farming back to what it once was, when yield was not\nking, industrialization not the norm, and small farms dabbled in many things\nrather than specializing in one.\n\nFeatured Video\n\nHolden\u2019s main crops are oats and peas, sown in rotation with grassland to\nbuild soil fertility. These are then turned into a \u201cmuesli\u201d used as additional\nfeed for his grass-fed cattle and his pigs. The pigs\u2019 manure fertilizes the\nland. The glossy Ayrshire cows are milked and the milk curdled into the farm\u2019s\naward-winning cheddar cheese. Woven through everything is the intention to\nwork with and mimic nature.\n\nThe purported benefits are profound: Healthy soil retains water and nutrients,\nsupports biodiversity, reduces erosion, and produces nutritious food. But\nthere\u2019s one other, critical gain in our rapidly warming world: these farming\nmethods suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and store it back in the\nsoil. As well as making cheese, Holden, with his regenerative practices, farms\ncarbon.\n\nSoil is second only to the ocean in its carbon-absorbing capacity\u2014it holds\nmore than the atmosphere and all the planet\u2019s plants and forests combined. But\ncenturies of damaging, industrialized agriculture have left the earth depleted\nand spewed ton of CO_2 into the ether.\n\nAccording to the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization, many cultivated soils\nhave lost 50 to 70 percent of their original carbon. By some counts, a third\nof the excess CO_2 in the atmosphere started life in the soil, having been\nreleased not by burning fossil fuels but by changing how the planet\u2019s land is\nused.\n\n\u201cPeople ask, \u2018Where is the excess carbon coming from?\u2019 It\u2019s where we\u2019ve\ndestroyed the soil,\u201d says Elaine Ingham, an American soil microbiologist and\nthe founder of Soil Food Web, an organization that teaches growers how to\nregenerate their soil. \u201cEvery time you till, you lose 50 percent of soil\norganic matter,\u201d she says, referring to the compounds that lock carbon into\nthe earth.\n\nExactly how much carbon soils can hold isn\u2019t agreed on, and estimates vary\nwidely on the potential impact of regenerative farming. For instance, the\nRodale Institute, a regenerative agriculture nonprofit, has looked at peer-\nreviewed research and agronomists\u2019 observations and concluded that\nregenerative agriculture, if adopted globally, could sequester 100 percent of\nannual carbon emissions.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 17 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nMatt Kamen\n\n  * Gear\n\nThinking About Buying a Hybrid Car?

What kind of incentives would be required to enable\nfarmers to farm in this way? There are a whole bunch of uncertainties.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Crawford thinks regenerative agriculture could have a big impact\nif widely applied. \u201cIt\u2019s been estimated that around 20 percent of current\nglobal emissions would be very hard to abate,\u201d he says, referring to things\nlike heavy industry and aviation where decarbonization with renewable energy\nisn\u2019t a straightforward option. He reckons better strategies for working the\nworld\u2019s soil could mitigate about half of these hard-to-eradicate emissions.\n\nEven modest improvements in farming would amount to big gains. Jacqueline\nGlade, the former chief scientist at the UN Environment Program, has\ncalculated that using better farming to store 1 percent more carbon in half of\nthe world\u2019s agricultural soils would be enough to absorb about 31 gigatons of\nCO_2 a year\u2014which would pretty much plug the gap between current planned\nemissions reductions and what actually needs to be slashed by 2030 to stay\nwithin 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming.\n\nEven if the exact amount of carbon that can be stored in soil isn\u2019t clear,\nthere would be other benefits\u2014of that, Crawford is confident. He set out a\ndecade ago to understand how soils function\u2014what enables them to maintain a\nmixture of air and water across a wide range of climatic conditions and thus\nsupport microbial and plant life.\n\nHe discovered that soil\u2019s secret sauce is carbon. The more in the soil, the\ngreater its resilience to erosion, flooding, and drought, and the greater the\nyields for farmers. And numerous studies (from the likes of the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to the United Nations) illustrate\nthat the best way to achieve this is through regenerative methods. \u201cPeople\nhave been farming that way for millennia,\u201d Crawford says. \u201cYou could say it\u2019s\njust good practice. If you follow those principles, you will improve soil\nhealth. I see the evidence.\u201d So does Holden, in the flourishing wildlife that\ncalls his land home.\n\nBut a wide-scale shift to carbon-absorbing practices would be dramatic\u2014the\nmajority of farmers would need to change how they work. And with most farmers\noperating on wafer-thin margins, embattled by climate change and demands for\ncheap food, and the victims of price shocks passed down the supply chain, the\ntransition remains unpalatable, or simply unfeasible, for many.\n\nHolden, though, has a strategy for getting farmers to transition. \u201cPay them to\nbe carbon stewards. Why do you think the farming system that I represent\nhasn\u2019t gone to scale? Money.\u201d Currently, he argues, industrialized, intensive\nsystems pay better\u2014what\u2019s needed are redirected subsidies to ensure farming\nand nature can coexist in a field and homogenized annual sustainability audits\nthat reward farmers for generating \u201cpublic goods\u201d like improvements in food\nquality, biodiversity, and carbon stores.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 17 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nMatt Kamen\n\n  * Gear\n\nThinking About Buying a Hybrid Car?

But if\nI was paid to be a carbon steward, I\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d\n\nBut this presents another hurdle: It\u2019s tricky to accurately measure a soil\u2019s\ncarbon content\u2014which is integral to doling out carbon credits. Various\ntechnologies exist, to varying degrees of accuracy and expense. Some companies\nuse computer models; others, farmers\u2019 self-reported practices.\n\nThen there\u2019s the concern over the potential hit to yields. \u201cMost of the\nresearch shows that as you move to regenerative practices, there is about a\nthree-year period where yields will drop,\u201d says Crawford. One organization\nthat measures this is Carbon Underground, a company created in 2014 to\nmitigate climate change by restoring soil blighted by industrial agriculture\nand rekindle its ability to absorb carbon.\n\nCofounder Larry Kopald says the group has found yields rarely drop by more\nthan 5 percent and usually rebound quite quickly. Sometimes this means there\nis a shortfall for farmers; other times, there\u2019s no financial loss due to the\nreduction of input costs, thanks to needing less fertilizer or fewer expensive\nbits of machinery. \u201cThe net-net to the farmer is often a better situation than\nthey\u2019re at now. And add to that the ability to monetize carbon drawdown,\u201d says\nKopald, referring to the potential to sell carbon offsets against sequestered\ncarbon.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important now is not finding the solution, but scaling,\u201d says Kopald.\nAnd this, he believes, is all about empowering the small farmer. \u201cWe think\nthat industrial farms grow all of our food; 70 percent is grown by small\nfarmers.\u201d\n\nCrawford, though, thinks what\u2019s needed is bigger: \u201cwhole value-chain\ntransformation\u201d\u2014big farmers, small farmers, and everyone that works with them.\nHe has already set up a coalition of companies, which cumulatively had the\n\u201cpotential, the reach, the governance, and the resource to restore the health\nof 60 percent of the world\u2019s agricultural soils,\u201d he says, only for this to\nfail because of a lack of will. So in his opinion, a carrot-and-stick approach\nis needed\u2014give farmers cash, but use legislation to force the rest of the\nsupply chain to fall in line.\n\nCarbon farming, ultimately, buys us time, Crawford believes. The world wants\nto get to net zero\u2014by removing historic emissions from the atmosphere and\nneutralizing current ones\u2014by 2050. None of the existing solutions for removing\natmospheric carbon will scale fast enough to have an impact in the coming\ndecades, Crawford says. This is why nature-based solutions are crucial.\n\n\u201cBut they will run out,\u201d he continues. Soil has a finite capacity; global\nsoils cannot perpetually soak up carbon. \u201cAt some point, carbon stocks will be\nas high as they can get\u2014anything more you add will just go back into the\natmosphere. But this is the important point\u2014we have no alternative for at\nleast the next two decades. All I\u2019m looking for is to buy about 20 years. We\ncan do that with soil.\u201d\n\nThe world needs protecting, now more than ever. But preserving the natural\nworld and advancing human knowledge requires innovative and pioneering\nsolutions.
