Some are using it to measure employee\nsatisfaction as well.\n\nThe P stands for \u2018promoter\u2019, but of course, it doesn\u2019t actually measure\npromotion.\n\nIf that many of your customers are actually promoting and recommending your\nbusiness to others, you would be so busy you wouldn\u2019t have time for a survey.\n\u201cWould you recommend\u201d is not the same question as, \u201chow many people have you\ntold?\u201d\n\nWhat the respondent is actually saying is whether or not they like you.\n\nBeing liked is important. Trust, comfort and delight are useful things to\nstrive for.\n\nLiked doesn\u2019t get you promoted, though. People promote a brand or activity\nwhen it increases their status or the affiliation they have with others, not\nbecause they owe you something.\n\nSmart marketers understand that peer-to-peer recommendations are scarce and\nprecious, and we shouldn\u2019t be distracted by an NPS that doesn\u2019t actually\nmeasure that.\n\nApril 29, 2024\n\nShare This\n\nFacebook\n\n### Share on Mastodon\n\nPrivacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.
