U.S. lawmakers\nhave expressed deep concern about TikTok\u2019s Chinese ownership, suggesting that\nthe Chinese communist regime could use the app to spy on Americans or use it\nto promulgate pro-China propaganda.\n\n## Related Stories\n\nVIP+\n\n### \u2018Civil War\u2019 Record Opening Leaves A24 With More to Prove\n\n### Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Announces 2024 Inductees: Cher, Jimmy Buffett,\nMary J. Blige, Dave Matthews, Peter Frampton, Foreigner and More\n\nThe Senate approval of the TikTok ban bill was tied to a $95 billion package\nof foreign aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. The Senate, by a 79-18 vote,\nOK\u2019d the bundled legislation after the House passed the resolutions Saturday\nand sent them on an expedited basis to the Senate for approval on an up-or-\ndown vote.\n\nTikTok will file a legal challenge once the bill is signed into law, Michael\nBeckerman, TikTok\u2019s head of public policy for the Americas, wrote in a memo to\ncompany staff over the weekend. The legislation is a \u201cclear violation\u201d of the\nFirst Amendment, the exec wrote: \u201cThis is the beginning, not the end of this\nlong process.\u201d Beckerman also criticized the TikTok divest-or-ban measure as\n\u201can unprecedented deal worked out between the Republican Speaker [Mike\nJohnson] and President Biden.\u201d\n\n### Popular on Variety\n\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\nAhead of the vote, Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), chair of the Senate Intelligence\nCommittee, delivered comments on the Senate floor Tuesday afternoon about the\nnational security threats posed by ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok. Passage of\nthe bill \u201cgoes a long way towards safeguarding our democratic systems from\ncovert foreign influence,\u201d he said, saying that Chinese companies like\nByteDance \u201cdon\u2019t owe their obligation to their customers, or their\nshareholders, but they owe it to the PRC [People\u2019s Republic of China]\ngovernment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not an effort to take your voice away... I would emphasize this is\nnot a ban of the service you appreciate,\u201d Warner said, addressing TikTok\nusers. Regular Americans aren\u2019t privy to classified briefings members of\nCongress have received about TikTok from intelligence services and the risks\nit poses as an entity \u201coperating at the direction of a foreign adversary,\u201d\nWarner said. \u201cWe hope that TikTok will continue under new ownership \u2014 American\nor otherwise. It could be bought by a group from Britain, Canada, Brazil,\nFrance. It just needs to no longer be controlled by an adversary that is\ndefined as an adversary in U.S. law.\u201d\n\nSen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), chair of the Senate\u2019s Commerce, Science and\nTransportation Committee, suggested TikTok and ByteDance are \u201cweaponizing\u201d\ndata and AI to spy on American citizens, the military and government\npersonnel, including journalists covering the company. (In 2022, ByteDance\nsaid it fired four employees for \u201cmisconduct\u201d after the company found they\naccessed TikTok data on several users, including two reporters.)\n\nSen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) spoke out against the TikTok ban bill before the\nfinal vote, saying the more pressing \u201cclear and present danger\u201d is the harm\nkids face from social media apps more broadly, including from U.S.-based\ncompanies.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t deny that TikTok poses some national security risks,\u201d Markey said.\n\u201cTikTok has its problems. No. 1, TikTok poses a serious risk to the privacy\nand mental health of our young people.\u201d But he said the bill likely would\nresult in \u201cwidespread censorship,\u201d and he suggested that the bill\u2019s supporters\nobject to liberal political viewpoints popular on TikTok. \u201cInstead of\nsuppressing speech on a single application, we could be addressing the root of\nthe mental health crisis by targeting Big Tech\u2019s pernicious, privacy-invasion\nbusiness model of teenagers and children in our country,\u201d Markey said.\n\nTikTok has said the bill, if it becomes law, would infringe the free-speech\nrights of its 170 million U.S. users and \u201cdevastate\u201d the estimated 7 million\nAmerican businesses on the platform. It claims TikTok contributes $24 billion\nto the U.S. economy annually.\n\nThe TikTok divest-or-ban legislation has been opposed by the ACLU and other\nadvocacy groups.\n\n\u201cThis is still nothing more than an unconstitutional ban in disguise,\u201d Jenna\nLeventoff, senior policy counsel at the ACLU, said in a statement Tuesday\nprior to the Senate vote. \u201cBanning a social media platform that hundreds of\nmillions of Americans use to express themselves would have devastating\nconsequences for all of our First Amendment rights, and will almost certainly\nbe struck down in court.\u201d\n\nBecause of its Chinese ties, TikTok has been a political football in the\nUnited States for years, as well as in other countries (including India, where\nit\u2019s been banned since June 2020). TikTok has prevailed in challenging other\nlaws in the U.S. seeking to ban the app. Last December, a federal judge\nblocked Montana\u2019s first-of-its-kind statewide ban of TikTok, ruling that the\nlaw likely violated the First Amendment. An attempt by the Trump\nadministration to force ByteDance to sell TikTok or face a ban also was found\nunconstitutional by federal courts on First Amendment grounds.\n\nUnder the \u201cProtecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications\nAct\u201d bill, Apple and Google\u2019s app stores and web hosting services in the U.S.\nwould be barred from hosting any \u201cforeign adversary controlled application.\u201d\nSpecifically, it would prohibit distribution of TikTok unless ByteDance\ndivests its ownership in the app within nine months of becoming law, with an\nadditional 90-day extension possible at the president\u2019s discretion if \u201ca path\nto executing a qualified divestiture has been identified.\u201d Johnson, the House\nspeaker, incorporated the TikTok ban (revised with the extended divestiture\ntimeline) into the emergency supplemental appropriations bill in a bid to win\nRepublican support for the package of foreign aid.\n\nBackers of the TikTok bill argue that it doesn\u2019t restrict free speech, saying\nit only requires apps to be owned by a company that isn\u2019t subject to the\ncontrol of an adversarial foreign government. As a precedent, the\nlegislation\u2019s proponents point to the 2020 sale of dating app Grindr by\nChinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech Co. to a group of U.S.-based\ninvestors, a transaction forced by the U.S. government over concerns about the\nprivacy of the app\u2019s users.\n\nPer the text of the bill, legal challenges to the \u201cProtecting Americans From\nForeign Adversary Controlled Applications Act\u201d may be filed only in the U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\nIf TikTok is unsuccessful in getting the divest-or-ban law overturned, it is\nunlikely that ByteDance would sell its ownership stake \u2014 and that the app\nwould effectively become outlawed in the U.S. Chinese officials have said the\ngovernment would \u201cfirmly oppose\u201d any forced sale of TikTok, which would\nrepresent a technology export and be subject to the government\u2019s approval.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to be able to force ByteDance to divest,\u201d James Lewis, SVP\nat the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the New York Times\nlast month.\n\nComments\n\nWant to read more articles like this one?\n\nSubscribe Today\n\n## More From Variety\n\n### Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Announces 2024 Inductees: Cher, Jimmy Buffett,\nMary J.
