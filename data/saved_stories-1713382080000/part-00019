Home\n  2. articles\n  3. story 2 acid test clause\n\n# Story #2 - The Acid Test Clause\n\n\u201cA contract is only as good as the people who sign it,\u201d was a saying often\nquoted by an elderly attorney I worked with for the first fifteen years of my\npractice and I always nodded in his general direction when he said that and\nsmiled as if agreeing. I liked and respected him, he had won more cases than\nthere were months in my life at the time and he had lived in a legal and\nbusiness world in which the entire community knew one another and knew who to\ntrust.\n\nThat world is long gone, with our population quadrupled in terms of business\npeople and multiplied by ten in terms of attorneys practicing. The odds are\ngood you now deal with strangers, know little about them, and simply cannot\ntrust that the influence of the community will direct their actions.\n\nBut even in his smaller, kinder, world, I wondered how accurate his quotation\nwas. Why bother with a contract, then, I always thought. Simply rely on people\nto do \u201cthe right thing.\u201d Since that lawyer had written thousands of contracts,\nhis actions belied his words.\n\nWhen people are angels perhaps contracts will not be needed. That time is not\nnow and any business which does not have its battery of contracts is not long\nfor this world.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the contract that is useful for business-the very process of\ngetting a contract can teach you a great deal about the person who you are\nthinking about joining in a business venture. Indeed, if done correctly,\nbefore you sign on the dotted line, the negotiation itself will tell you what\nis likely to happen.\n\nAs I saw with a doctor who now lives in Tuscany, in part because he and I\nlearned all we needed to know about a man waving a million dollars in his face\nand begging him to take it.\n\nThe doctor turned him down cold and it was \u201cthe best deal he never made,\u201d as\nhe told me a year later.\n\nDoctors are notoriously difficult for lawyers to work with...at least\naccording to lawyers...who find that the doctor\u2019s scientific background gives\nthem little patience for the maneuvers and subtleties that mark the usual\nbusiness negotiation. To many doctors, the answer to a legal or business\nquestion should be as straight forward as a simple diagnosis.\n\nAnd as more and more doctors are forced to become business people, they\nconfront more and more \u201cgrey\u201d areas of business and employment law which are\nimposed upon their consciousness whether they like it or not. That doctor\ncalled it being forced to slide into the \u201c...mire of complex chemical bonding\nof inarticulate and unintelligible legal jargon.\u201d I didn\u2019t argue when he said\nthat because he was a genius and I had learned not to argue with a genius.\n\nHe was a research scientist who had invented a device that measured some\nmicroscopic part of one\u2019s intestine that somehow was going to make him and his\npartners rich. At least that\u2019s what he thought and since one of his partners\nknew a big time venture capitalist (\u201cVC\u201d) with a lot of successes to his name,\nthat might just happen since he would have the capital to bring it to market.\n\nBut the problem was we had to negotiate how to get that VC into the company\nwithout giving the company away and the VC had a reputation for coming in with\nlots of money...then suing everyone in sight long enough that, broke and\ndistraught, they threw the asset in his direction and gave up control of the\nproduct. One of my law partners called him the \u201c\u2019poison pill\u201d of VCs since\nonce you took him in, it was only a matter of time until your control of your\ncompany died. We needed his money and my task was to find a way to have the\nmoney but not the turmoil.\n\n\u201cYou think he is trying to trap us like he did the others?\u201d asked my doctor\nclient.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know. VCs get a bad rap no matter what they do. Inventors like you\nalways blame them for coming in and trying to protect their investment by\nputting controls into the company. VCs always blame the inventors for thinking\nthat because they can invent something, they can run a business. It\u2019s hard to\nknow what the guy is really all about.\u201d\n\nHe was annoyed that I had hinted he was bad at business. He paused, then\nsnapped, \u201cSo...test him.\u201d\n\nHe had that exasperated look on his face he got whenever he was forced to say\nsomething that he considered self evident to us mere mortals. That always\nannoyed me and since we were old friends I let him see that.\n\n\u201cRight. Good idea. Written or oral?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything can be tested. That\u2019s the nature of reality. There must be a\nrelatively objective method available.\u201d\n\nOf course he had a point but I was curious to see what he thought would work.\n\u201cLie detector test? Perhaps we can torture him to get him to admit his\nmotivations? I\u2019m sure...\u201d\n\n\u201cNot scientific,\u201d broke in the doctor, not smiling. \u201cPolygraphs seldom are\nreliable and torture is useless to find the truth. The subject merely tells\nyou whatever you want to hear to stop the torture. No, use a scientific test\nfor good faith. After. what, a thousand, five thousand contracts, you must\nhave one. Use it.\u201d\n\nI stared at him and he stared right back. A long moment of silence. \u201cYou still\ndon\u2019t get that law is not medical research. There are no sure fire tests...No\npatented devices for honesty and integrity. Perhaps that could be your next\ninvention...\u201d\n\nHe pressed. \u201cI do not believe that you have not developed a series of\nquestions or methods by which to accurately gauge the good faith of a\nprospective investor and I suspect you are teasing me because you are annoyed\nwith me.\u201d He would talk like that, you see. Then he grinned. \u201cI am told you\nare brilliant at this. This should give you an excellent opportunity to\ndemonstrate it.\u201d\n\nAnyone calling me brilliant can mollify me so I explained, \u201cThere are some\nmethods, some pretty good ones. But they are not objective, I suppose. We\ndon\u2019t put it into a test matrix, doctor. Besides, we have little bargaining\nposition you tell me. We need his money. You only have one source now\navailable. What do you do if he fails my test?\u201d\n\nHe stood up, all five feet six of him, one finger in the air. \u201cYou find out if\nhe is interested in working in good faith as a team or not. If the latter, the\nmoney I lose in rejecting him is trivial compared to the trouble I would have\nin accepting him. There are other sources of money out there...\u201d He paused for\neffect \u201c...but only one product that can do what this does.\u201d\n\nOf course he was wrong in that, several other competing products came out a\nfew years later....but he was dead right in that there are some pretty good\ntests that anyone can use to determine if a potential business partner is more\ninterested in seizing power than sharing profits, as can be seen by what\nhappened in this negotiation.\n\nThe VC never used a lawyer for the initial negotiations, only when it was time\nto close the deal and after ten minutes in the room, I could see why. This was\nduring the High Tech boom times when wearing a suit and tie was considered an\nantique fashion and most of the young brilliants wore \u201cBanana Republican\u201d\nKhakis and pastel shirts, no tie, loafers. That is what I expected but he\nappeared in a conservative three piece business suit, horn rimmed glasses and\nreminded me of Clark Kent on a mission. Soft spoken, almost shy but clearly\nwith an agenda.\n\nAnd he knew his stuff. He had a scientific background, a sharp mind, and had\ndone his homework. He had signed all the confidentiality agreements I had\ninsisted upon without demur, without change, even agreeing to clauses\nprohibiting him from entering the particular medical field we were servicing\nif our deal did not go through. That surprised me. VCs don\u2019t like to be\nrestricted in such a broad fashion. But as I watched him work the doctor, I\nrealized why. He had no intention of not buying the product and was convinced\nwe would sell it to him since he was the only game in town.\n\nThe doctor liked him. They were both tech nerds, both loved the elegant\nsimplicity of the device, both were happy it was going to make a huge\ndifference in medicine, and neither was only in it for the money. I might as\nwell have been in another building as they poured over the specs and discussed\nthe European market. I let it go on for an hour then threw my monkey wrench\ninto the love fest with my first question.\n\n\u201cHow much will you put in for how much interest, Mr. Oswald (not his real\nname)?\u201d\n\nThey both looked at me as if I had uttered a profanity. I smiled. \u201cSorry, but\nthat\u2019s what my job is, you know. Money and power. Unpleasant things but\nnecessary to consider.\u201d\n\nOswald paused a moment, then opened another file. \u201cOur firm has standard\ncriteria for determining how much to invest and when.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd those criteria indicate that you will put in a little money now, and only\nbe obligated to invest more if certain milestones are met in a timely manner\nand if they are not met, you gain control of the company?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me a moment, then smiled. \u201cOf course. We do not write blank\nchecks. But we are reasonable in those criteria. I can see your client owns a\nvery valuable product and has done a great deal by taking it this far on the\nbusiness plan. I am very impressed.\u201d He looked at the doctor to show him he\nwas impressed. The doctor looked back to show him he liked that.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted you agree that we are well along in our plan,\u201d I said,\nfiddling with my own papers, \u201cand, of course, we need to know specific amounts\nand specific criteria in some detail. We are not interested in losing control\nbecause we are a few weeks late in the implementation of the business plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not. You will find we are reasonable and I am talking about a\nmillion dollars upfront money right now...within two days of our execution of\nthe documents...with an additional two million upon prototype being finished\nwithin six months and a final three million upon approval by governmental\nauthorities. For twenty percent. That is quite reasonable, I believe. One seat\non the board unless criteria are not met. Three seats on the board if criteria\nis not met after ninety additional days. And you will find our timelines are\nmore conservative than yours. And the doctor remains CEO.\u201d\n\nI nodded but thought, \u201cUntil we blow a deadline. Which we will, business being\nwhat it is...and you get the control of the company ninety one days after that\nhappens.\u201d But what I said was, \u201cThat seems something we can use to start our\ndiscussions, certainly.\u201d He nodded, realizing that the Dance of Negotiations\nhad begun and waited for our counter. Instead, I used my first test.\n\n\u201cIt is unusual to begin at the enforcement of contracts end of our\ndiscussions, I realize, but it is important for us to know if the document we\neventually create is practical from our point of view.\u201d He was a bit surprised\nand raised his eyebrows. I went on. \u201cThe best contract in the world is of no\nuse to us if the expense to enforce it is beyond our capacity. And dangerous\nto us if our adversary has funds to enforce it and we do not. We like\nefficient and inexpensive methods for enforcement.\u201d\n\nHe leaned back in his chair, considering. \u201cYou are speaking of arbitration,\nperhaps? Avoiding formal court and discovery and all that for a private\njudge?\u201d\n\n\u201cSmart boy, \u201c I thought, and wondered how he would turn it down. I nodded.\n\nHe shook his head sadly. \u201cWe once thought that would be an excellent\nalternative to the law courts. It certainly had its advantages. Without\ndepositions, without the need for long court law and motion matters, we did\nsave tens of thousands.\u201d He looked at the doctor, very sincere. \u201cBut we\ndiscovered why discovery and those formal court procedures exist. They exist\nfor a reason, you know. That\u2019s how you discover the truth.\u201d\n\nThe doctor had immediately understood that he was witnessing the \u201ctest\u201d he had\nasked for and, like any good scientist, did not interfere with the test in\nprogress. He merely looked back, interested but noncommittal. Oswald saw that\nand turned back to me.\n\n\u201cWe like to know what the other side is going to present and not be surprised\nat the hearing.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps I could agree with you...but that is a moot point. We can always\nagree in our arbitration agreement to allow depositions or other forms of\ndiscovery. Limit them to save expense, but allow critical discovery. So that\u2019s\nno real problem, is it?\u201d\n\nHe tried another approach. \u201cNo appeal. And the arbitrator is not even bound to\nfollow the law. Is that not true?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomewhat true. The Courts are lenient in overturning their decisions. Give\nthe arbitrators great latitude.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Such laxity that in our case, despite the appellate court knowing that\nthe arbitrator was wrong on the law, he still upheld the award. We were\noutraged.\u201d\n\nI bet you were, I thought. \u201cThat seems most unfortunate. But I have been in\nhundreds of arbitrations and that has never happened. Most arbitrators do\ntheir best to follow the law and apply it. I know of no exceptions. You must\nhave been very unlucky.\u201d\n\nHe said nothing, just watched me do my stuff.\n\nI went on. \u201cIt\u2019s simple, really, A small contract case will take two to three\nyears and cost at least a hundred thousand dollars to try and there can be two\nmore years of appeal. That same matter in arbitration would cost half as much\nand take six months. The odds of a bad arbitrator are really not much worse\nthan the odds of a bad judge or jury, are they?\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps not, but we get full appeal rights in court. Almost none in\narbitration. We just won\u2019t go along with taking that chance again. That is a\ndeal killer.\u201d He watched me to see what I would do.\n\nI paused and did nothing waiting to see if he was firm. He said nothing, I\nstill said nothing and the doctor looked at me to see if this test was enough\nto kill the deal.\n\nIt was not. Oswald had a good point and I knew plenty of very good attorneys\nand business people who hated arbitration, figuring that arbitrators, largely\nunafraid of the appellate courts, could be tyrants and dangerous and who\nwanted unlimited discovery so they would not be surprised by evidence at the\narbitration.\n\nBut one could always put discovery into the arbitration clause if that was\nimportant and most arbitrators, including myself, were pretty good at\nfollowing the law. Arbitration is not perfect. Neither are the courts. But we\ncould afford arbitration and it was a real question if we could afford a real\nfight against such a well funded opponent if push came to shove. A contract\nwithout power to enforce it...is not worth the paper it is written on. I\nsmiled as I thought that and the VC wondered what was going through my head.\n\nWhat was going through my head was the real test I was planning to use now.\nAnd this test was the important one, the \u201cacid test\u201d and I went to it\nimmediately. \u201cWell, if we cannot use relatively inexpensive methods of\nenforcement, we can still avoid some of the problem by simply providing that\nthe winning party in any dispute gets attorney fees from the losing party.\nSimple as that. It stops fights before they begin since both sides only go to\ncourt if they are convinced they will win. No insincere fights since if you\nlose you pay for your opponent\u2019s attorney fees as well.\u201d\n\nAnd was the great equalizer as well. To win a fight and get a million dollars\nbut spend two million to get it means you lost even if you won. A big budget\nopponent knows that and can destroy your case by simply forcing you to spend\nmoney. But if the winning side can get attorney fees from the other\nside...well, the cost benefit ratio then allows even the party with less money\nto take on a giant...if they are convinced they will win.\n\nHe tapped his fingers, face blank. I went on. \u201cThat\u2019s the law in Germany and\nin quite a few European nations, you know. That\u2019s one reason they have so\nlittle litigation. No nuisance suits. Here, as I am sure you know, in most\ncases you don\u2019t get awarded attorneys fees if you win unless you put it in the\ncontract. We almost always do that in our contracts.\u201d\n\nHe sighed, glanced at the doctor, then answered, eyes on his file. \u201cWell, that\nhas not been our experience at all. Indeed, not. Indeed, attorney\u2019s fees being\nawarded to the winning party encourages litigation in our experience.\u201d\n\nI leaned back in the chair. \u201cReally? We seem to have a very different history.\nWhat would be the rationale for people starting nuisance actions if they knew\nthey would not only pay their attorney but yours as well? One would expect\nthat to be...a disincentive, no?\u201d I wondered what nonsense he would develop.\n\n\u201cOne would think so, but people are irrational. They think it will give them\nmore when they win.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs it would. And if both sides think they will win, that is a fight that\nshould go forward and the one that is right will be made whole. That seems\nonly right to us.\u201d\n\nAnother silence. In reality, we both knew what the real issue was. If he had a\nlot of money and our client did not, an attorneys fees clause such as we\nproposed would allow us to fight him if he started a suit just to force us to\ncapitulate because the fees were so high. Any party really intending to work\nin good faith should have no hesitation in such an obviously useful clause-a\nclause that truly makes the wronged party whole if there is litigation.\n\n\u201cAnything that makes it easier to go to court hurts business relationships, \u201c\nhe said to the doctor, \u201cand this clause encourages people to take their chance\nin court rather than work out their differences.\u201d\n\nThe doctor looked at me, saw my expression, and turned back to the VC. \u201cUtter\nnonsense, Mr. Oswald, and I am upset that you think such weak arguments would\nsway me. Of course we must have an attorney fee shifting clause or I could\nnever approach your litigation budget and you could use your in house staff of\nattack dogs to force me to accept any position you take.\u201d\n\n\u201cAttack dogs? \u201c I asked, a little upset.\n\n\u201cAttack dogs?\u201d Oswald said, equally upset.\n\n\u201cPresent company excepted, of course,\u201d went on the doctor, not even looking at\nme. \u201cMr. Oswald, I am not a nincompoop. I am aware that if you have a hand gun\nwith bullets and I have a hand gun without bullets, that all your expressions\nof good will and interest in my project mean little for if we have a falling\nout, you will win. I see this clause as loading my gun...which neither will\nhopefully ever use. Please do not insult me by pretending otherwise.\u201d\n\nThe doctor was outwardly calm but I could see he was inwardly furious. He felt\nhe was being played for a fool, had been set up by the interest in his project\nshown by Oswald who was simply pulling a con job on him. I was not\nupset...this is all part of the game and any VC who did not bargain in this\nmanner was not much of a VC. The doctor was new to this and still emotionally\ninvolved.\n\nOswald also saw the dynamics and tried to save the day. \u201cDoctor we have a\ndifference of opinion. This is not an insult, merely what allows fruitful\nnegotiations.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgain, nonsense. If you treat me as a man of above average intelligence, you\nwould have honestly stated that you, with more funds, wish to be able to\nbludgeon me into submission if we have a legal fight, knowing that I will\nnever get back the fees I spend for my own legal counsel and that my only hope\nis to meet all criteria religiously. That is your actual position, is it not?\u201d\n\nOswald was getting angry and I was seeing this negotiation collapse and was\nlooking for a way to break into their argument. Oswald leaned forward.\n\u201cDoctor, you invented a fine device. You know I like it. It is not proof of\nbusiness acumen or negotiation skill.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is certainly true, \u201cI interjected, and gave the doctor a look telling\nhim to shut up before Oswald walked.\n\nThe doctor leaned back in his chair, seeing that I wanted him to calm down,\nbut before I could say something, looked at me and simply asked, \u201cThat is your\ntest, correct?\u201d\n\nSilence in the room. Oswald, looking confused, was staring at me.\n\n\u201cWell...yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen this is a waste of time since he has failed it. Let us end this now.\u201d\n\nOswald could not believe it. He held up his file. \u201cI have a million dollars in\nan account ready to be deposited into your company the moment we agree. Our\nterms are certainly within the range of your thinking are they not?\n\nThe doctor was already packing his briefcase. \u201cYes, they are. Not where we\nwant them, but close enough.\u201d Then he looked hard at Oswald. \u201cBut you are not,\nMr. Oswald. In two ways. Counsel had one test to see if you wished power\nrather than cooperation and you failed that. But I had my own test. Would you\nequivocate why? I perhaps could work with a man of power interested in power\nif he was honest with me and we set the rules up clearly. But a man of power\nwho does not tell me his true motivations? That is too much.\u201d\n\nAnd he left the room.\n\nOswald shook his head at me, slowly. \u201cYour client is being very foolish, you\nknow. I see it all the time. These scientists...\u201d\n\nWas he? Well, Oswald crushed the next two inventors he worked with...tossing\nthem some money after he had pushed them out the door of their own companies.\nThe doctor...well, he\u2019s in Tuscany, though it took him an extra two years to\nraise the money. Two years in which his competitors almost beat him out.\n\nAnd during that time I often asked him if he had second thoughts. He did not.\n\u201cI may fail, but I will fail because my product or my business thinking is not\ngood enough. I will not fail because my own backer stabs me in the back. I\nhave no regrets.\u201d\n\nWell, he\u2019s in Tuscany. I\u2019m still here.\n\nDoing my acid tests...\n\nArticle Categories\n\nLessons from the Combat Zone - Lawyer's Stories with a Moral\n\nWar Stories\n\n## Share this article!\n\nEmailGmailYahoo MailCopy LinkShare\n\n### Related Articles\n\n##### Attorney Fee Provisions in Consumer Contract Arbitration Clauses\n\n##### Binding Contracts and Legal Actions Predicated on Breach of Contract\n\n##### Contract Documents That Consistently Produce Change Orders\n\n#### Find Articles in our Online Library\n\nFind helpful legal articles & summaries on key areas of the law!\n\n## Start resolving your legal matters - contact us today!\n\nFounded in 1939, our law firm combines the ability to represent clients in\ndomestic or international matters with the personal interaction with clients\nthat is traditional to a long established law firm.\n\nRead more about our firm\n\n\u00a9 2024, Stimmel, Stimmel & Roeser, All rights reserved | Terms of Use | Site by Bay Design\n\n\u2713\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\nAddToAny\n\nMore...\n\n", "frontpage": true}
