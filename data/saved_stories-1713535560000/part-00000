Digital drum kit made in toddle\n\nDrum machines revolutionized music production in recording studios. They mimic\nthe sound of a drum kit and make it easy to create repeatable beats. Try it\nout.\n\nVakis Rigas\n\nApril 17, 2024\n\nWhy on earth are we talking about drum kits? Yes, you are correct. Drum kits\nare irrelevant to web development, and it makes no sense to write about them\nother than that they are an incredibly fun toy to play with.\n\nBut we wanted a good excuse to play around with one of the latest packages in\ntoddle: Web Media. This package allows you to control media playback in\ntoddle.\n\nA drum machine is one of the best use cases for that package, so we thought\nwe\u2019d build one\u2014not just any drum machine, but one that looks like something\nteenage engineering would build.\n\nIf anyone from @jugendingenieur wants to build one, you\u2019ve got a customer.\n\nThe app lets you adjust the volume, insert new beats, adjust the output of\neach beat and share your beat to X.\n\nThe app is 100% built in toddle. There\u2019s no custom JavaScript code or other\nfancy tricks involved.\n\nThe app consists of a set of variables that control things like beats, beats\nper minute, etc. We also added a series of formulas for the various kits and\nconfigurations.\n\nTo bring it all together, we added some workflows to control things like the\nURL(updates every time you configure your drum machine), the beats, and more.\n\nThe drum machine is easy to use; click any button to add a beat. Each row\ncontrols the frequency of the beats, and each column represents various parts\nof a drum kit, such as crash, snare, kick, etc.\n\nThe dial controls your beats per minute. You can drag the mouse up to increase\nthe speed to 280 or down to 0. The numbers 1, 2, and 3 represent different\nvariations of the beats, and you control your session with the play and pause\nbuttons.\n\nYou can share your beats to X or click the copy button to copy the URL and\nshare it elsewhere.\n\nAndreas made a short video of how it\u2019s built and works.\n\nYou can build anything in toddle, and this is an example of how you can let\nyour creativity flow freely and create something other than a basic web app\nwith landing pages. If you'd like to take it a step further and create a whole\nband, you could technically do that.\n\nIf you're curious and love to reverse engineer apps, you can see how we built\nthe app here. Feel free to clone the app, make it your own.\n\nThis was my best attempt at a funky beat. Can you make a better one?\n\n## Bring your idea to life!\n\ntoddle is a visual web app builder that rivals custom code and is accessible\nto everyone.\n\nTry toddle \u2014 it's free!\n\n### Product\n\nRead the docsStatus\n\n### Templates\n\n\ud83e\udd16 ChatGPT App\u2600\ufe0f Weather App\ud83d\udc0d Snake App\ud83c\udfe0 Home Rental App\ud83e\uddee Calculator App\n\n### Legal\n\nTerms & ConditionsPrivacy Policy\n\n### Company\n\nBlogPress kitContactPartner program\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2023 toddle.
