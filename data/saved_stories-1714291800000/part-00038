He is the\nauthor of We Built Reality: How Social Science Infiltrated Culture, Politics,\nand Power, and coauthor, with Mark Bevir, of Interpretive Social Science: An\nAnti-Naturalist Approach.\n\n#### Related Topics\n\n  * Technology\n  * Politics\n  * Medicine\n  * Science\n\n### Share\n\nIn the second book of his enduring study of the early republic, Democracy in\nAmerica, Alexis de Tocqueville began his discussion of what he called \u201cthe\ninfluence of democracy on the action of intellect in the United States\u201d by\nnoting the distinctive tendency of the individual to appeal to the \u201cexercise\nof his own understanding alone.\u201d Practical and pragmatic, trusting in the\nauthority of their senses, thinking like good Cartesians without having read\nDescartes, Americans, Tocqueville continued, \u201creadily conclude that everything\nin the world may be explained, and that nothing in it transcends the limits of\nthe understanding.\u201d Such self-reliance, he believed, was laudable in many\nrespects, but it had an obvious, and potentially dangerous, corollary:\nAmericans \u201cfall to denying what they cannot comprehend.\u201d^11xAlexis de\nTocqueville, Democracy in America, trans. Henry Reeve (New York, NY: Vintage\nClassics, 1990), vol. II, ch. 1. Originally published 1840.\n\nMostly what Jacksonian-era Americans denied, according to Tocqueville, was\n\u201cwhatever is extraordinary\u201d and \u201cwhatever is supernatural.\u201d^22xIbid. He noted\nas well that Americans were as respectful of learning, the fine arts, and\nscience as one might expect of a pragmatic, commercially oriented people, even\nif the practical and applied sciences counted for more to them than the\ntheoretical ones. Following Tocqueville\u2019s lead, one might argue that Americans\nfor the most part have long maintained a tempered respect for the authority of\nscience, an attitude that has generally contributed to the country\u2019s material\nprogress and well-being.\n\nThat attitude has recently been tested. On a range of issues\u2014from climate\nchange and vaccination to evolution and nutrition\u2014America now teems with\npopular movements whose central aim is the rejection of one or another\nscientific finding or position. COVID-19 has further dramatized these\ntensions, driving antipathies between scientific experts and the sundry\nmovements commonly referred to as \u201cpopulist\u201d out onto the streets.\n\nMany of last spring\u2019s protests brought together a strange mix of citizens\nunited by their rejection of measures recommended by medical scientists to\ncurb the spread of the disease. This assortment of the discontented included\nconservative operatives, suburban entrepreneurs, paramilitarized nationalists,\nunemployed wage workers, and antivaxxers. One of the enduring images from\nthose early days of the pandemic was a photograph taken in Denver of a\nlockdown protestor, in a star-spangled shirt, hanging out the window of a\nDodge truck (a \u201cLand of the Free\u201d sign draped over the passenger-side door),\nstaring down a medical worker in full scrubs and surgical mask standing in\nsilent counterprotest in the middle of the road. The image struck a chord,\ncirculating widely as a symbol of the confrontation between populist anger and\nscientific authority.\n\nThe same confrontation was also evident in conservative media. In a highly\ncontroversial series of posts, First Things magazine editor Rusty Reno\nexceeded his own usual hyperbole to denounce public health recommendations on\ncurtailing business and all kinds of assembly, including religious services.\n\u201cWe live in a technocratic social order,\u201d Reno fumed, condemning an \u201cexpert\nclass...[that] impose[s] draconian measures of restriction and control.\u201d Reno\nwent on to quote the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben, who has argued that\nthe pandemic exposes the tendency of modern societies to value nothing more\nthan \u201cbare life\u201d and \u201csurvival.\u201d^33xR.R. Reno, \u201cCoronavirus Diary: New York,\nMay 12,\u201d First Things, May 13, 2020, https://www.firstthings.com/web-\nexclusives/2020/05/coronavirus-diary-new-york-may-12.\n\nBut in subsequent weeks, the tension between surviving the coronavirus and\nother rival goods triggered an equally powerful reaction from the American\nleft. This came dramatically to the fore after the murder of George Floyd and\nthe mass mobilization of huge numbers of Black Lives Matter protestors across\nthe country. In a stark contrast with their earlier rebuke of right-wing\npopulists for flouting public health guidelines, many health professionals now\nseemed to countenance a less restrictive approach to social distancing and\npublic assembly. In early June, more than 1,200 health and medical experts\nsigned a letter maintaining their opposition to a \u201cpermissive stance on all\ngatherings, particularly protests against stay-home orders,\u201d but cited the\n\u201cpervasive and lethal force of white supremacy\u201d as an overriding threat to the\n\u201chealth specifically of black people\u201d\u2014and thus as justification for public\nprotests.^44xAaron Greiner et al., University of Washington consortium of\ninfectious disease specialists, public health professionals, infectious\ndiseases professionals, and community stakeholders, \u201cOpen Letter Advocating\nfor an Anti-Racist Public Health Response to Demonstrations against Systemic\nInjustice Occurring during the COVID-19 Pandemic,\u201d June 5, 2020,\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jyfn4Wd2i6bRi12ePghMHtX3ys1b7K1A/view.\n\nIn a widely cited follow-up piece in The Atlantic, Julia Marcus of Harvard\nMedical School and Gregg Gonsalves of the Yale School of Public Health\nreasoned that epidemiologists must \u201cmaximize the health of a population across\nall aspects of life,\u201d arguing that \u201cthe health implications of maintaining the\nstatus quo of white supremacy\u201d were \u201ctoo grave to ignore, even with the\npotential for an increase in coronavirus transmission.\u201d^55xJulia Marcus and\nGregg Gonsalves, \u201cPublic-Health Experts Are Not Hypocrites,\u201d The Atlantic,\nJune 11, 2020, https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/public-\nhealth-experts-are-not-hypocrites/612853/.\n\nTo observers on the right, such responses only intensified the sense that\nscientific authority was being politicized in favor of some causes and not\nothers. A representative response was voiced by Hillbilly Elegy author J.D.\nVance, who remarked on how the \u201cmoral scolding ceased as soon as elite-favored\nprotests began taking place.\u201d The result, according to Vance, would be a\nfurther erosion of \u201ctrust in our country\u2019s experts.\u201d^66xJ.D. Vance\n(@JDVance1), \u201cI am still amazed...,\u201d Twitter, June 3, 2020,\nhttps://twitter.com/jdvance1/status/1268163828476448774?lang=en.\n\nMore recently, some public health specialists have also expressed discomfort\nat what appear to be conflicting standards. As Nicholas Christakis, a Yale\nprofessor specializing in biosocial science, told the New York Times this\nsummer, \u201cWe allowed thousands of people to die alone. We buried people by\nZoom. Now all of a sudden we are saying, never mind?\u201d^77xMichael Powell, \u201cAre\nProtests Dangerous? What Experts Say May Depend on Who\u2019s Protesting What,\u201d New\nYork Times, July 6, 2020,\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/us/Epidemiologists-coronavirus-protests-\nquarantine.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage.\n\nHow did we arrive at this crisis of scientific authority? And is there a way\nto repair the damaged relationship between democratic deliberation and\nscience?\n\n## The Problem of Popular Revolt\n\nGrappling with the problem of popular revolt against scientific authority in\nthe United States requires first distinguishing among different sources of the\nconflict. As historians have long known, much of the country\u2019s exceptionally\nfierce antiscientific sentiment is attributable to certain peculiar cultural\ntraditions. Works like Richard Hofstadter\u2019s Anti-Intellectualism in American\nLife and Susan Jacoby\u2019s The Age of American Unreason have established major\nsources of resistance to scientific expertise, including the practical-minded\ndistaste for theoretical reflection that Tocqueville noted in the nineteenth\ncentury, as well as forms of religious fundamentalism that acknowledge no\nauthority beyond the truths revealed in sacred texts.\n\nThese traditional currents of resistance to scientific authority are likely to\npersist. Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution remains generally secure in American\npublic schools, but creationist and intelligent design alternatives continue\nto be on offer in fundamentalist religious schools and colleges. While these\ncurrents sometimes support and coalesce with the more recent and broader\nrevolt against scientific and intellectual authority, they do not explain the\nmore complex and partially justifiable reasons for the current populist\nbacklash.\n\nAs I argue in my recent book, We Built Reality, much of the confusion\nsurrounding scientific authority in modern society stems from either the\nexercise of fraudulent scientific expertise or the extension of scientific\nauthority into areas where it does not belong.^88xJason Blakely, We Built\nReality: How Social Science Infiltrated Culture, Politics, and Power (Oxford,\nEngland: Oxford University Press, 2020). In particular, specialist claims of\nscientific authority in matters of governance and social organization have\ncome to be seen by more and more Americans as a bid for power by elite cliques\ncontemptuous of the broader public. Furthermore, there is a connection between\nthis dubious use of scientific authority (which is often based on research\nthat violates the best practices of science or social science) to much that\nhas gone wrong in contemporary America, from excessive regulations and\nfinancial crashes to militarized and racialized policing to overly biological\nand medicalized understandings of happiness and love, and even to scientific\npolling and surveys that misread the real needs and inclinations of American\ncitizens.\n\nConsider the 2008 financial crisis. Although most economists did not foresee\nit, many of them played a decisive role in encouraging the behavior and\npractices that ultimately brought on the recession, even to the point of\ndenying the existence of a housing bubble and advising Americans to continue\ninvesting in real estate. That such advice was proffered in terms of a\nsupposedly neutral and predictive economic science (drawing on the allegedly\nrigorous approach of the dominant neoclassical paradigm) only deepened popular\nsuspicions of number-crunching, model-building elites who were supposed to\nknow better.\n\nIndeed, one of the chief findings of the Dahlem Report, written by a group of\neconomists uneasy with the neoclassical paradigm, was that their profession\nplayed a central role in generating the 2008 crisis by making exaggerated\nclaims about the precision and scientific rigor of economic models and\ntheories.^99xDavid Colander et al., \u201cThe Financial Crisis and the Systematic\nFailure of Academic Economics,\u201d University of Copenhagen Department of\nEconomics Discussion Paper No. 09-03, March 9, 2009,\nhttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1355882. Economists and\nfinancial gurus had bolstered unwarranted confidence in housing markets and\ncomplex financial products (including the infamous toxic assets), thereby\ninspiring forms of economic exuberance that accelerated the collapse.\n\nThe political ramifications of that disaster are well known. While ordinary\nAmericans experienced life-altering losses of wealth, unpopular policies\u2014often\nchampioned by the same experts who had contributed to the mess\u2014were enacted to\nbail out banks and financial institutions that economists deemed \u201ctoo big to\nfail\u201d (minimizing the losses of those in the upper economic strata, including\nmost bankers). Not surprisingly, this targeted bailout helped energize both\nthe Occupy Wall Street and Tea Party movements. As the journalist Chris\nHedges, a prominent voice in the Occupy Wall Street movement, later observed,\nthe regnant economic theorists prescribed policy \u201con the basis of myth\u201d and\nideology, not science.^1010xChris Hedges, \u201cReign of Idiots,\u201d Truthdig, May 1,\n2017, https://www.truthdig.com/articles/reign-of-idiots/.\n\nThe problem here is the abuse of scientific authority in what are clearly\nself-interested ways\u2014a problem that is closely related to an even more\nfundamental misuse or misunderstanding of science known as scientism. A\nrecurrent tendency in modern cultures, from the positivism of Auguste Comte to\nthe reductionist zeal of many contemporary neo-Darwinians, scientism is the\npromotion of an excessive faith in the power of science to provide\nauthoritative answers to, ultimately, everything, including all questions\nbearing on truth, meaning, right, and wrong. While repeatedly batted down by\ncritics, including many thoughtful scientists and philosophers, the specter of\nscientism has returned time and again in modernity, making overstated claims\nthat bedazzle the credulous while heightening the suspicions of those who\nthink the experts are going far beyond sound science and weaving just-so\nstories to advance personal, professional, or political agendas.\n\nScientism is clearly a political problem today\u2014and the popular suspicions\naroused by it are not merely the product of intellectual error, ignorance, or\nreligious principle, though the present populist backlash has contributed to\nan alarmingly widespread attraction to outlandish conspiracy theories. More\nroutinely, though, the dubious uses of scientific authority in public policy\ndebates make more and more citizens feel excluded from the democratic\nprocess\u2014rejected on the grounds of ignorance, stupidity, or general\ndeplorability.\n\nAmericans today desperately need a way to discern the rightful role of\nscientific authority within the practices of democratic policy and\ndeliberation\u2014both for the sake of democratic legitimacy and of science itself.\nWhat are the proper limits of scientific expertise? And how do we decide when\nto follow the scientists and when instead to allow for the messy free play of\ndemocratic deliberation and contest?\n\n## Deliberating over Science\n\nSeveral factors have exacerbated the present clash between democracy and\nscience. One is the declining quality of science education and the failure to\ninstill in citizens a basic understanding of what science can and cannot do.\nSuch failures are evident in the skirmishes and legal battles over the\napproach to evolutionary science in public school classrooms\u2014as in Kitzmiller\nv. Dover, a high-profile 2005 case determining whether or not a Pennsylvania\nschool district could require the teaching of intelligent design.\n\nThere is also the long-standing problem of communicating science\u2019s provisional\ncharacter to a broader public. Specifically, scientists often have difficulty\nexplaining that their discoveries are authoritative without being absolute.\nWhile science may provide a reasonable working picture of what is the case in\nthe physical and biological worlds this picture nonetheless remains contingent\nand open to revision. Unfortunately, this lack of absolute certainty can in\nturn be exploited by skeptics, amateurs, hacks, and ideologues who have their\nown special interests in mind.\n\nBut scientists, in turn, must also learn to better recognize the authority of\ndemocracy. A widespread failure to respect both the rightful domain of science\nand its clear limitations has been an important factor in the intensity of the\nclashes between populists and scientists over the pandemic. In particular,\ngenuine expertise in an area like epidemiology is too often expanded into\nauthority over laws and public policy more generally. But the facts of how a\ndisease spreads, for example, remain philosophically distinct from the\nquestion of how we ought to respond as a people\u2014what goods ought to be valued,\nwhat sacrifices made, and what policies enacted.\n\nEpidemiologists and other health officials should obviously be heeded on such\nmatters as the origins and transmission of the coronavirus, risk factors, and\nthe treatments and possible cures for COVID-19. The public should also respect\nwhat health officials have to say about practices that are likely (even if not\nalways certain) to prevent the spread of the disease, including the wearing of\nmasks and social distancing.\n\nFor laypeople to challenge epidemiologists on the science of such matters is\ndangerous and ultimately self-destructive (as is evident in the rising\ninfection and fatality rates in the United States). Unfortunately, the\nirresponsible promotion of science denialism, alternative views, and\nconspiracy theories by opportunistic politicians and media figures, mostly on\nthe American right, has only encouraged the spread of a deeply irrational and\nindefensible strain of anti-intellectualism. We are in deep trouble when\npeople buy into unfounded and simply erroneous notions, whether it\u2019s that\nCOVID-19 is milder than the flu, or that it will suddenly and magically\ndisappear, or that it has some kind of secret, esoteric origins unknown to\nworking epidemiologists.^1111xPolitiFact and Bill McCarthy, \u201cFox News Host\nTucker Carlson Said the Coronavirus Isn\u2019t as Deadly as We Thought. Experts\nDisagree,\u201d Poynter.com, May 5, 2020, https://www.poynter.org/fact-\nchecking/2020/fox-news-host-tucker-carlson-said-the-coronavirus-isnt-as-\ndeadly-as-we-thought-experts-disagree/; \u201c24 Times Trump Said the Coronavirus\nWould Go Away,\u201d Washington Post, August 5, 2020,\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/24-times-trump-said-the-\ncoronavirus-would-go-\naway/2020/04/30/d2593312-9593-4ec2-aff7-72c1438fca0e_video.html; Caleb Ecarma,\n\u201cHow the Right-Wing Disinformation Loop Helped Kill Virus Research Funding,\u201d\nVanity Fair, May 11, 2020, https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/05/right-wing-\nmedia-trump-kill-coronavirus-research-funding.\n\nNonetheless, for all the dangers this populism poses, it should make us\nconsider why there has been such a loss of trust in science and scientific\nauthority. Populists are not wrong in thinking that too much political\ndecision-making today is dominated by cliques of ruling experts and lifted out\nof the sphere of public deliberation and concern. Too often law and public\npolicy are treated as the special domain of a small group of managers and\nwonks, speaking their specialist jargons and invoking their infallible\nmetrics. But public policy is never the exclusive domain of scientific or\ntechnocratic knowledge. Maybe even more importantly, policymaking involves\ntelling stories about what is politically and ethically significant. In\nfashioning the governing narratives of a democracy, the voice of science can\nbe only one of many voices.\n\nThat point holds true from the simplest to the most technical public policies.\nPublic plans and projects are always shaped and guided by a narrative complete\nwith heroes and villains, backstories and subplots. Wars, infrastructure,\nregulatory laws, policing strategies\u2014these are born only within a narrative\nfield, animated by some overarching notion of what is worthy. Deliberating\nover public policy therefore requires identifying the moral weight and\nmeaning\u2014and indeed the broadest possible consequences\u2014of certain\nactions.^1212xMark Bevir and Jason Blakely, Interpretive Social Science: An\nAnti-Naturalist Approach (Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, 2018),\n179\u201383. In the case of the COVID-19 crisis, this involves interpreting the\nsignificance of preventing the spread of the virus in balance with\nconsideration of other public goods\u2014including those of racial equality,\neducation, livelihood, mental health, familial ties, and religious\ncommitments, among many others.\n\nPublic health experts often helpfully inform citizens as to the technicalities\nof various findings and options, but the content or significance of the\noverall story that determines action should be the product of democratic\ndialogue and contestation. Although policy analysts and health experts are\nessential in informing the public about the various options, ordinary citizens\nretain a say in what story to tell about a given challenge or problem. Indeed,\nwhen it comes to the stories informing public policy in a democracy,\nscientists and nonscientists, experts and laypeople, must be on equal footing.\nAny claim to absolute authority over public policy by any group of experts is\nan illegitimate power grab.\n\nThis more interpretive and democratic approach requires that public health\nexperts and analysts avoid the temptation to present themselves as having\nspecial insight or a greater say over what is ultimately the right policy.\nDuring the current pandemic, public health experts such as Marcus and\nGonsalves unfortunately succumbed to that temptation, invoking their ability\nto \u201cmaximize the health of the population across all aspects of life\u201d in order\nto determine which causes justified risking infection and death and which did\nnot.^1313xMarcus and Gonsalves, \u201cPublic-Health Experts Are Not Hypocrites.\u201d\nOne may agree with Marcus and Gonsalves\u2019s support for Black Lives Matter (as I\ndo), but there is a real political danger in justifying actions in support of\nthe cause on speciously scientific grounds. No specialist scientific knowledge\ncan determine what goals are ultimately worthy or unworthy of sacrifice.\n\nThe ironic effect of technocratic overreach is to discredit the real\nscientific expertise that public health specialists have to offer. Without\nalways being able to articulate why, ordinary citizens feel that experts are\nunfairly excluding them from the political process. No longer willing to learn\nfrom the experts, they fall prey to various forms of pseudoscience and\nquackery\u2014abandoning that fundamental wariness of \u201cwhatever is extraordinary\u201d\nthat Tocqueville lauded in early-nineteenth-century Americans.\n\nDemocracy and science can be mutually reinforcing only if there is a\nrecognition of the limited authority of each. Just as science is not the\ndeterminer of questions of self-governance and ethical sources shaping our\nculture, so democratic acclaim should not be the basis for the validity of the\nfindings of science. In the face of a daunting global pandemic (and other\nimmediately pressing threats such as climate change), citizens\u2019 concerns about\nracial justice, livelihoods, education, religious observance, mental health,\nor other goods cannot be dismissed as having less standing or being less\nurgent simply because they cannot be validated through scientific testing and\nformulation. In the narrative that is constantly shaping a democratic society,\nand being shaped by it, the various voices advancing various goods must be\ngiven a fair hearing even if as a people we determine, provisionally, that\nsome goods take precedence over others. The future of democracy rests on\nwhether we learn to tell\u2014and to live\u2014the right stories together.\n\nReprinted from The Hedgehog Review 22.3 (Fall 2020).
