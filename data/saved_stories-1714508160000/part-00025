And here, summer means a lot of manual work. Which\nmakes me think of that common psychological response to having too much to do:\nStress.\n\nI do a lot of stupid work (not stupid as in unnecessary but stupid in the\nsense that I do not need my brain to do it). Which gives me a lot of time to\nthink about work and the mental states related to it. Like the feeling of\nstress. Why do we get it? What is it good for? How can it be avoided? Should\nit be avoided?\n\nAfter a number of years, I think I have cracked the code: Stress is the\nfeeling one gets when there is so much to do that it can't be done without\ncheating. For most people, cheating is unpleasant. In order to get the courage\nto cheat, we need another unpleasant feeling to whip us into it. And that\nfeeling is called stress.\n\nStress is what we experience when we have too many deadlines to meet too soon.\nWe know that something must go. But we don't know what. So the feeling of\nstress becomes a perpetual spur to cheat with small things. Maybe work can't\nbe sacrificed. But cooking can. So stressed people eat sandwiches and drink\nCoke although they know they will feel bad from it in the long term. They\navoid double-checking details they know they should be double-checking and\nhope to get away with it. They know they should be friendly to people around\nthem, but they cheat with that too, because they know they will get away with\nit, for a while at least.\n\nStressed people are constantly asking themselves a certain question: Am I\ndoing the right thing right now? Am I doing something that I should actually\nbe cheating with? That way, whatever stressed people are doing, they always\nquestion whether they should be doing something else instead.\n\n###\n\nHow to abolish stress\n\nAfter having realized that stress is essentially about cheating, I had the key\nto stop feeling stressed in everyday life: Only set ridiculously realistic and\nflexible goals for myself. Decide exactly what I want to do with the time and\nenergy I have and do that and nothing else.\n\nHumans in general want to do more than they are able to do. That is only\nnatural. The opposite, wanting to do less than one is technically capable of\ndoing is called depression. That is not a nice feeling. So the first step\ntowards not being stressed is accepting that if ambitions are higher than\nability, that is just a sign of mental health.\n\nStep 2 is to choose consciously among those ambitions. This is hard, because\nit requires giving up on parts of one's identity. I want to be a person who\nworks hard, keeps physically in shape, spends time with my children, reads\nbooks, writes about what I read, maintains a home with a certain standard of\nmaintenance and cleanliness, has many children, wears clothes that are not\nvisibly worn out... I want all that. And I can't achieve all that. I have to\nchoose.\n\nThe choice can be made two ways:\n\n  1. Consciously and calmly making priorities: What is important and what is less important? What needs to be done right now and what can be saved for later? What should I simply skip?\n\n  2. Unconsciously and chaotically. Try to do everything that would be nice to do, and cheat constantly in the process.\n\nThe cost of avoiding stress is to admit to oneself: Actually, I'm no better\nthan that. I can't achieve more. The benefit, except the obvious emotional\nbenefits, is the opportunity to do things as thoroughly as one prefers.\n\n###\n\nWhen to apply stress\n\nWhat is the good thing with stress then? It is to get the power to cheat when\nit is unavoidable.\n\nSometimes, hopefully most times, it is possible to admit to oneself that one\nthing or another isn't doable and needs to be down-prioritized, come what may.\nSometimes, one or another thing just can't be consciously down-prioritized: An\nimminent threat to life and property. A person in danger for physical or\npsychological reasons. Higher powers that threaten to ruin one's life and\nrequire immediate action.\n\nWhen really fast decisions are required, spontaneous cheating is the only\nappropriate mechanism. When calm, conscious cheating isn't possible, panicked,\nspontaneous cheating is a necessity. It has saved innumerable lives.\n\nIn a state of battle, stress is the appropriate attitude. In a state of\neveryday work, it is not. Or at least shouldn't be.\n\n###\n\nLife is a battle\n\nMaking a priority list is easy. People should have figured that out a long\ntime ago. Why do so many people, maybe a majority of people in certain age\nbrackets, still feel significantly stressed? And why do so many employers\nprefer to keep their workforces under constant, low-intensity stress?\n\nSome jobs are a bit like war. People need to keep vigilant in order to\nsurvive. Some jobs are plain impossible and workers need to cheat in order to\nuphold a semblance of doing them. But people who are doing entirely normal,\ntechnical things at work are often stressed too. Employers are establishing\nroutines and then load so much work on people that those routines can't be\nupheld. Then they leave it to the employee to decide how to cheat with those\nroutines.\n\nIs that wise? If everybody involved is actually very bad at making priorities,\nit could be. There might be many people who are just incapable of prioritizing\nconsciously, but who are capable of prioritizing subconsciously. That is,\npeople who only work effectively when put under stress.\n\nBut I suspect the foremost reason why people feel stressed is that life really\nis a battle. In a battle, it is very unwise not to feel stressed, because you\nnever know what the battle will throw at you and you better be ready for\neverything, everywhere all at once. Many people also live their civilian lives\nthat way. They are constantly sparring against other people. And other people\nare unpredictable.\n\nWhen working with genuinely technical stuff, it is possible to make a list of\npriorities. In the social realm, it is not. There the big sport is to keep up\nappearances. Which appearance to keep up depends on who is looking. People who\nare acting on the social arena will always need to be alert in order to parry\nthe strikes of other people. They can't afford the meditative state of\ntechnical work.\n\nIn conclusion, the most important thing that can be done to decrease stress is\nto apply a technical mindset whenever a technical mindset is applicable. There\nare enough real wars as there are.\n\nGenre image of man trying to relieve his feeling of stress.

The stress of choice, even good\nchoices, can be very unpleasant but spur a person to action. I remember one of\nmy most stressed periods was after the birth of our first child. When I was\nworking, I felt like I was a bad parent for not being with our baby. When I\nwas with the baby, I felt stress from not working hard to provide. It was a\nno-win situation. I eventually realized what was happening and just told\nmyself if I was doing something meaningful for my work, mind, health or family\nthat I shouldn\u2019t feel any regret or stress. That helped.Expand full\ncommentLikeReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nViolent enough to stand still\n\nWhy human societies developed so little during 300 000 years\n\nJan 19, 2023 \u2022\n\nTove K\n\n54\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Violent enough to stand still\n\nwoodfromeden.substack.com\n\n47\n\nBecky is depressed\n\nJonathan Haidt and his team say teenage girls are depressed because they use\nsocial media too much.
