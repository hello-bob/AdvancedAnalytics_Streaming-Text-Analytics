Both charts were\nrecently resurfaced by the Accidental Tech Podcast.\n\nThe graphs show that Apple tended to increase the base memory every two years\nor so, but that this trend ended when Cook took over the company from Steve\nJobs. Memory increased quickly until the Mac Plus was launched in 1986, notes\nSchaub. \"1986 to 1990 were all about decreasing the entry Mac price,\" he says.\n\"Then we get a pretty straight logarithmic line until Tim Cook became CEO and\nthere has only been a single increase since.\"\n\nThe correlation is interesting, but other variables such as market trends and\nchanges in technology can help to account for the plateau in Cook's era. For\nexample, Stuart McHattie notes that early all-in-one Macs saw a tenfold\nincrease every six years. If that trend had continued from 2006 onwards when\nthe base was 500MB, modern base model Macs would have reached 500GB. Yet\ntoday's consumer PC demand for RAM remains around 8GB to 64GB, and very rarely\nexceeds double digits.\n\nComputers have also changed a lot over the last several years. RAM has gotten\nfaster. Hard disk drives have been superseded by solid-state storage. Chips\nand components are more tightly integrated. Apple no longer relies on Intel\nprocessors to power its machines, and instead uses high performance system-on-\na-chip (SOC) architecture, which fuses CPUs, GPUs, and unified memory into a\nsingle package. This is why the company feels confident in arguing that 8GB on\na Mac is comparable to 16GB on rival systems.\n\nBut that does not change the fact that Apple has offered iMac and MacBook Pro\nmodels with 8GB of RAM since 2012. Likewise, the MacBook Air has had the same\nbase memory configuration since 2017. In addition, Apple's adoption of unified\nmemory means that Macs cannot have their RAM upgraded after purchase, while\nApple continues to pursue a strategy of vastly overcharging customers for\nhigher memory configurations. Users often pay out $200 or more at checkout\njust to future proof their machines.\n\n  * Is 8GB of RAM Enough for a Mac in 2024?\n\nApple's Mac memory configuration strategy is likely to become even more\ncontentious if all upcoming iPhone 16 models turn out to include 8GB of RAM.\n(In the iPhone 15 series, only the Pro models have 8GB, whereas standard\nmodels have 6GB.) Why Apple is prepared to increase RAM in a smartphone but\nnot in a multitasking Mac without users paying excessively for the privilege\nwill be the overriding question on many consumers' lips.\n\n[ 146 comments ]\n\n## Top Rated Comments\n\nRies\n\n2 hours ago at 06:39 am\n\n> or...you know... a more sensible reason: plenty of consumers became fine\n> with the base ram\n\nThey also would be fine with a intel Celeron, doesn't mean it is ok to charge\nover $1000 for it.\n\nScore: 31 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nOrange Bat\n\n2 hours ago at 06:41 am\n\nApple keeping to 8GB in low-end computers is a joke at this point. The only\nargument Apple has at this point for not going with 16GB is that people are\nwilling to put up with it.
