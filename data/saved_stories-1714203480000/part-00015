Santiago/Getty Images\n\nThe IRS said Friday that more than 140,000 taxpayers filed their taxes through\nits new direct file pilot program and participants saved roughly $5.6 million\nin fees they would have otherwise spent with commercial tax preparation\ncompanies.\n\nThe government pilot program, rolled out this tax season in 12 states, allows\npeople with very simple W-2s to calculate and submit their returns directly to\nthe IRS for free. Those using the program claimed more than $90 million in\nrefunds, the IRS said.\n\nBut despite what IRS and Treasury Department officials said was a successful\nrollout, they aren\u2019t saying yet whether the program will be available next\nyear for more taxpayers. They say they need to evaluate the data on whether\nbuilding out the program is feasible.\n\n\u201cWe will take time to analyze the data and collect feedback from a wide\nvariety of stakeholders before making a decision about direct file\u2019s future,\u201d\nIRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel said on a call with reporters.\n\nThe program, which became available to the public on March 8, cost roughly\n$10.5 million for technology and product development and another $2.4 million\nfor customer service, cloud computing and user authentication.\n\nWhile the Treasury set a goal of reaching 100,000 users for the pilot, 140,803\ncompleted their taxes using the program. More than 3 million people used the\nIRS\u2019 eligibility tracker to see if they could use the program, and 423,450\npeople logged into the program.\n\n\u201cRegardless of where it goes from here, I am proud of the success of the\ndirect file pilot,\u201d Werfel said.\n\nThe tax season began on Jan. 29, and the filing deadline for most people was\nApril 15.\n\nThe program was available to certain taxpayers in Florida, New Hampshire,\nNevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming. Four other\nstates that have a state income tax also were part of the pilot program \u2014\nArizona, Massachusetts, California and New York. In those four, state tax\nagencies helped people directly file their state taxes as well.\n\nAccording to the latest IRS data, this tax season the agency has received\n119.5 million returns, compared with 117.3 million received in the same\ntimeframe last year. Refunds this tax season add up to $220 billion, compared\nwith $215 billion last year.\n\nLearn how to take control of your personal finances with Get Your Due, our\nsix-week email bootcamp.
