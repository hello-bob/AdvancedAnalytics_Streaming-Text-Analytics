In hindsight I can\u2019t even remember if it ever\nmattered for any auctions I observed, but the theme I took away was that one\nday maybe the PBOC wouldn\u2019t buy in an auction and the Treasury would be in\ntrouble.\n\nDidn\u2019t think about this again until I saw this chart recently:\n\nSource here\n\nYou don\u2019t have to squint that hard to see where this is headed. The crypto\nworld has (probably) unintentionally designed a system that will likely\nstrengthen USD as a reserve currency. Here\u2019s why.\n\nA frequent talking point of bitcoin maximalists is\n\n  1. US government (and most governments) borrow too much and print a lot of money\n\n  2. This is stealing wealth from the future\n\n  3. Eventually this behavior will drive hyper inflation and debase the dollar.\n\n  4. When this happens the dollar will go into freefall\n\n  5. So owning bitcoin is a hedge against #1 - #4\n\nI personally think dollars behave weird relative to other currencies because\nof reserve status and a bunch of other things (eg there are just not that many\nthings that are as liquid as dollar markets so if you operate at a certain\nscale, dollars are hard to avoid), but I\u2019m genuinely not particularly\ninformed, thoughtful or up to date about the dynamics. In addition, a second\nmacro take (just what I absorb from the business press) is:\n\n  1. The world gets more multipolar/less integrated every day\n\n  2. For this reason (and others bunch of other reasons) China (and probably a bunch of other governments) are less interested in owning US Treasurys (and are thus buying more gold), which partially explains why Gold spot prices are at all time highs while ETF holdings of Gold are cratering. Story for another day [3]\n\nI don\u2019t have a good argument for why this macro theme is happening, but lots\nof data points to it being true. However I think cryptocurrency enables\nanother interesting thing to happen, that really is a counterweight. Under the\nhood, there\u2019s insane demand for dollars relative to supply, from non-US\nindividuals and businesses. For non-US individuals, USD is often a more stable\nway to save than their home currency, and local banks make it hard to get[4].\nFor non-US businesses, lots of crossborder trade (about 40%) still settles in\ndollars. Wealthy individuals in most developing countries will often move\ntheir excess savings to the US/UK/Europe. Cities like London, Vancouver and\nNew York all have real estate markets that reflect this demand for dollar\ndenominated assets. Non-wealthy individuals in developing countries really\nstruggle to access USD, and have for decades, and as a result there\u2019s pent up\ndemand for it. I\u2019ve talked about this a bit before.\n\n##\n\nStablecoins for Emerging Markets\n\nThe \u201cdigital gold\u201d pitch for cryptocurrency (ie, that it is a hedge for\ninflation and its permissionless [2] nature enables consumers to protect\nthemselves from a wealth seizure by their local government) is far more true\nfor stablecoins (a cryptocurrency pegged to a reserve currency like the US\nDollar), than it is for bitcoin. In addition, given the largest proportion of\nfiat backed stablecoins are backed by USD, stablecoins are not really THAT\nuseful as an inflation hedge for US citizens.\n\nA person in a country with a mismanaged currency might theoretically want to\nown bitcoin at some stage for speculative purposes. However, the volatility so\nfar makes it atrocious as a store of value, because you have no confidence\nabout how much value will be available to you when you actually need to use\nit. Said another way, in emerging markets, the average citizen does not have\nsufficient excess savings necessary to stomach bitcoin volatility for savings\nthey might need on a rainy day. It makes bitcoin a very expensive and\ninefficient store of value in the short term. In contrast, prior to the\nexistence of cryptocurrency, it was (and still is) fairly common for wealthy\nindividuals in poor countries to hold foreign currency (typically USD, GBP or\nEUR) as a mechanism for savings. As a market maker, I used to think (and I\nstill think) that a good heuristic for a country\u2019s economic trajectory is\n\u201cwhere do the country\u2019s rich put their wealth?\u201d. Wherever wealth is exported\n(eg if the move in your country when you get rich is to immediately buy New\nYork or London real estate) is a signal that citizens are afraid of wealth\nseizure, either explicitly by taking it away, or implicitly by printing it\naway.\n\nGovernments hate this because it creates natural selling pressure for their\nhome currency and puts assets somewhat beyond their reach. However, a fiat-\nbacked stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar or Euro (with real assets under\nmanagement) that is permissionless and effectively beyond the ability of the\nlocal government government to stop you from buying, is simply a digital asset\nsubstitute for a real use case that already exists. Before stablecoins, you\nhad to buy dollars from a bank and keep it in a bank account (which has its\nmerits) but the bank could also a) just refuse to sell them to you, b) charge\nyou a ton of fees to buy or hold it or c) be forced by the government to\ntransact at a fake exchange rate or limit how much you could buy or own. Even\nin today\u2019s environment, if you\u2019re in the US you should try going to your local\nBank of America or logging into your Chase mobile app and try to buy some\neuros, and it will become blindingly obvious how unsupported this is.\n\nBasically, everyone around the world wants access to a relatively stable\ncurrency to denominate their savings in, one that has a predictable exchange\nrate vs. the goods and services they purchase every day. For most humans today\n(in 2024), dollars and euros are more stable than their home currency. A\nstablecoin backed by the dollar (or GBP, EUR, take your pick), is a\npermissionless way to do that. The loudest voices in crypto aren\u2019t incented to\ntell you this because USDC doesn\u2019t make them rich. Ironically, stablecoins\nactually help solve the runaway hyperinflation use case, while bitcoin merely\nenables a user to swap hyperinflation in their home currency for volatility in\ncrypto. That doesn't mean it has no utility; just that it\u2019s a crappy way to\nsave if you might actually need to access your savings at a time you couldn't\nanticipate.\n\n##\n\nThe weirdest unintended consequence\n\nStablecoins are turning retail investors/citizens/savers around the world into\nimplicit buyers of US Treasurys. Here\u2019s why:\n\n  1. Stable coins make it possible for people outside of the US to hold dollars and (in certain cases) earn interest in USD in a permissionless way that their governments can\u2019t control and that their banks would never make easy. The poorer you are, the harder it is to access USD. And this is only just starting - stablecoins have only started being utilized for non-crypto use cases, eg replacing SWIFT transactions and other crossborder SMB payments (this is what Bridge [1] does). I can only imagine that as the offline utilization of stablecoins expands, demand will continue to rise.\n\n  2. Well managed stables basically have to hold the stablest + most liquid securities, which are basically US Treasurys. For example as of February 2024, most of USDC was held in US Treasurys + repo + cash:\n\n  3. So stablecoin driven demand for Treasurys will grow pretty linearly with underlying demand for stablecoins themselves.\n\n  4. This basically means something like 90% of stablecoin demand will result in demand for Treasurys in some way.\n\nIn a weird way it\u2019s almost easier to buy stables which are a layer on\ntreasurys, than the underlying treasury itself. 3x growth in stablecoins will\nmake them a top 5 holder of USTs. So it isn\u2019t crazy that growth in crypto will\nhelp support dollars as a reserve currency for another generation.\n\nSource\n\n##\n\nImplications if these trends hold or accelerate\n\nA few potential effects come to mind if these trends hold. First, given\nstablecoins are largely backed by Treasurys - there are a few interesting\ncontagion scenarios we haven\u2019t experienced before. For example, the very\nhyperinflation event that crypto evangelists fear, could destabilize\nstablecoins and infect the broader crypto markets, if retail holders attempt\nto redeem en masse. Similarly, we could encounter a \u201cbreak the buck\u201d event\nwhere the redemptions accelerate over a weekend or outside of market hours as\nstablecoins are tradeable 24/7, but the stablecoin manager cannot produce the\nreal USD quickly enough because the underlying Treasurys do not trade 24/7\n(this could manifest as a de-peg where the stablecoin trades at a discount in\na panic such as when USDC was trading at 85c during the SVB crisis). This type\nof event could not only infect cryptocurrency markets, it could also infect\nmoney market funds as a class. It\u2019s hard to tell how this plays out - as\nstablecoin adoption grows generally, and institutional adoption of crypto\ngrows specifically, the transmission mechanisms between assets also change. In\ncrisis, assets tend to be far more correlated than we believe them to be in\npeacetime, and at their current scale, by the time we find out how it plays\nout, it will be playing out . ..\n\nSecond, treasurys held in stablecoins that are broadly distributed to retail,\nwith some sliver of margin monetized by the \u201cmanagers\u201d of the stables, are far\nless usable in a weaponized way, versus their foreign central bank held\ncounterparts. As stablecoins grow and hold more USTs, they\u2019re less likely to\nbe sold en masse in times of conflict and negatively impact the US\nGovernment\u2019s ability to fund itself, both because retail investors/savers\neverywhere are less likely to express their preferences (even if they\u2019re anti-\nUSD) by selling stables because their currencies are just as likely to be\nvolatile, and also because for the managers of stablecoins, earning yield is\nhow they make money (for example Tether earned $1b on Treasury yields in\n2023), so they\u2019re not inherently incented to sell unless there are\nredemptions.\n\nSaid slightly differently, the decoupling of U.S.-China and associated\nrestructuring of capital flows, is often thought to be bad for USD dominance.\nHowever, the emergence of stablecoins bucks this trend and can end up\nreinforcing USD and treasurys dominance. Purely for liquidity and network\neffect reasons - as fiat-backed stablecoins grow they\u2019re more liquid (and\ndollars are more liquid by extension) and as more unique individuals hold\ndollars (or dollar biosimilars) dollars become harder to destabilize.\n\nThird, \u201cflight to quality\u201d trades in times of conflict tend to favor the\nreserve currency (and in recent decades this is mostly USD), but historically\nthat shift is most pronounced by institutional investors (partly because most\nmarket activity is institutions, and partly because retail has terrible access\nto bonds). In a world where retail investors around the world have easy access\nto USD (via USDC/USDT) it\u2019s not crazy to expect a retail \u201cflight to quality\u201d\ntrade to emerge with retail investors round the world shifting out of a)\ncrypto and b) their own currencies into USDC, because for the first time ever,\nthey can.\n\nLast, there\u2019s some risk that emerging economies cede monetary policy/destiny\nto individual savers in their countries. Capital controls are a tool often\nused by governments to combat currency devaluation - this is much harder to do\nwhen your citizens can just buy USDC/USDT. Which implies that eventually, if\nfiat-backed stablecoins continue to grow in adoption, governments will begin\nto build tools in their toolkit to at least track their citizens\u2019 adoption and\nusage of stablecoins, in order for their capital controls to remain as\neffective.\n\nThanks to Brandon Carl, Amias Gerety, Justin Overdorff, Zach Abrams, Ranjan\nRoy, Saira Rahman & Temi Omojola for reading this in draft form.\n\n[1] In full disclosure I\u2019m an investor in Bridge.\n\n[2] I\u2019ve seen \u201cpermissionless\u201d used a few different ways, including to mean\nnot requiring KYC or AML on transactions. By using permissionless here, all I\nmean is; if you live in a country that\u2019s experiencing hyperinflation, that\ncountry\u2019s government cannot stop you from buying USDC, in the same way they\nbasically can stop you from opening a bank account that can access USD. Or at\na minimum, even if the government doesn\u2019t care, your local bank no longer\nstands in the way.\n\n[3] The most plausible synopsis I\u2019ve seen so far for the UST < > Gold effect\nover the past couple of years goes like this (h/t Brandon Carl) ;\n\n  * The West largely reappropriated Russia\u2019s money following the Ukraine war\n\n  * China and other countries obviously took notice - lots of data shows that they are now investing in gold instead of Treasuries.\n\n  * They are largely purchasing gold from people in the United States (ie ETFs selling gold)\n\n  * That provides cash to US investors.\n\n[4] To be very clear, I\u2019m referring to savings in the sense of a rainy day\npool of money you might need at some unpredictable time in the future in\nnormal course of business. This is in contrast to censorship resistance which\nyou need if your government is coming after you.\n\n### Subscribe to Kunle.app\n\nLaunched 3 years ago\n\nJoyfully being wrong on the internet\n\n11 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n1 Restack\n\n11\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Stablecoins are helping create a buyer of second-to-last resort for US\nTreasurys\n\nwriting.kunle.app\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nSeptember 2023: How to build sustainably differentiated tech enabled\nhealthcare services businesses\n\nFor digital health startups delivering care, clinical innovation is neither\nnecessary nor sufficient\n\nSep 18, 2023 \u2022\n\nKunle\n\n29\n\nShare this post\n\n#### September 2023: How to build sustainably differentiated tech enabled\nhealthcare services businesses\n\nwriting.kunle.app\n\n6\n\nJune 2023: Subtle Differentiation (or why there are no 10x products in\nfintech)\n\nSome times when you can't be 10x better at one thing, you can be 2x better at\n10 things.\n\nJun 11, 2023 \u2022\n\nKunle\n\n19\n\nShare this post\n\n#### June 2023: Subtle Differentiation (or why there are no 10x products in\nfintech)\n\nwriting.kunle.app\n\n7\n\nJanuary 2024: What if ACH had attachments?\n\nThe value of a high bandwidth payment network\n\nJan 17 \u2022\n\nKunle\n\n16\n\nShare this post\n\n#### January 2024: What if ACH had attachments?\n\nwriting.kunle.app\n\n5\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Kunle\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
