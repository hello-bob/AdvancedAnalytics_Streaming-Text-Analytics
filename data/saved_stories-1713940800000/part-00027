And just like the first\ntwo Firefly image models, Firefly Image 3 was designed to generate content\nthat\u2019s safe to use in your commercial work.\n\nLet us know what you think by clicking the \"Rate this result\" button available\non every generated image. You can also share feedback on Discord, Adobe\nCommunity or help compare outputs in the Rate Firefly images section of the\nwebsite. We couldn't build Firefly without our community and your feedback\nhelps us grow and improve.\n\nHere are just a few examples of how the innovations in Firefly Image 3 model\nbenefits you in your day-to-day work:\n\n  * Enjoy new levels of creative expression: The new model produces higher quality images, better interpretation of prompts, automatic application of styles that match your prompt, and more accurate text in images, allowing creatives of all skill levels to ideate easily.\n  * Gain enhanced creative control in the ideation process: Image 3 Model also works with our recently released Structure Reference and Style Reference capabilities to deliver exceptional user control and state-of-the-art visual quality. In addition, the new model has an improved ability to take reference images into account with a prompt. Eliminate the trial and error of having to write the perfect prompt by using reference images.\n  * Achieve a creative vision faster: Image 3 Model has a better understanding of text prompts and scenes, enabling image generations that better reflect long, complex prompts and include richer details, including text.\n\nAlso, we are introducing the Generative Expand feature in the Generative Fill\nmodule on the Firefly web app. This opens up creative options by enabling you\nto change the aspect ratio or size of an original image. Now, you can extend\nimages to fit any content needs like making space for text or fitting an image\nto a size specification.\n\nhttps://blog.adobe.com/en/promotions/firefly\n\n## Adobe\u2019s commitment to responsible AI\n\nFirefly has been used to generate over 7 billion images worldwide since its\ninitial beta release in March 2023. We built it for direct integration into\nworkflows Adobe customers use every day, including Adobe Photoshop, Adobe\nExpress, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Substance 3D. In just one year, Firefly\nhas transformed image editing, template creation, vector design, and 3D\ntexturing and staging for the better.\n\nA technology as powerful and transformative as AI requires a thoughtful\napproach, though. That\u2019s why we remain committed to developing generative AI\nresponsibly with creators at the center. We co-founded a global coalition\ncalled the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), which now has more than\n2,500 members from across industries working together to promote transparency\nin digital content with Content Credentials.\n\nIn particular, we\u2019ll attach Content Credentials to assets produced using\nFirefly so that people who work with or view the content can see how it was\nmade and whether AI was involved. This ensures we establish a transparent\nchain of trust from creation to dissemination online.\n\nTry the new Adobe Firefly Image 3 Model in the Firefly web app, Adobe\nPhotoshop, and Adobe InDesign today. And explore all the current Firefly\nfeatures by updating your apps to the latest version or experiment with them\nvia the Firefly web app.\n\nhttps://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2024/03/26/reimagining-customer-experience-\nage-ai\n\nhttps://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2024/04/16/growing-responsibly-age-of-ai-\nadobe-firefly-stock\n\nhttps://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2024/03/26/new-structure-reference-\ncapabilities-adobe-firefly-bring-new-level-creative-control-ideation\n\n", "frontpage": true}
