As discussed,\nmore than 100 individuals are currently occupying the South Lawn of Columbia\nUniversity\u2019s Morningside Heights campus. This group has been informed numerous\ntimes and in writing that they are not permitted to occupy this space, are in\nviolation of the University\u2019s rules and policies and must disperse. All\nUniversity students participating in the encampment have been informed they\nare suspended. At this time, the participants in the encampment are not\nauthorized to be on University property and are trespassing.\n\nThe actions of these individuals are in violation of University rules and\npolicies, including that they have interfered with the operation of the\nUniversity, refused to identify themselves, refused to disperse, set up tents\non campus space, failed to comply with policies, and damaged campus property.\nThe continued encampment raises safety concerns for the individuals involved\nand the entire community. The University provided multiple notices and\nwarnings and informed the encampment participants that they must disperse or\nface immediate discipline. We have also engaged on the issues they have raised\nand offered to have further discussions if they disperse.\n\nI have determined that the encampment and related disruptions pose a clear and\npresent danger to the substantial functioning of the University.\n\nWith great regret, we request the NYPD\u2019s help to remove these individuals. We\nunderstand that the first step in this process will be for NYPD to use its\nLRAD technology to inform the participants in the encampment that they must\ndisperse and give them time to leave prior to taking any additional action. We\ntrust that you will take care and caution when removing any individual from\nour campus. The safety and security of our community is our highest priority.\nWe appreciate your commitment to assist us in a peaceful and respectful manner\nat this difficult time.\n\nColumbia is committed to allowing members of our community to engage in\npolitical expression \u2013 within established rules and with respect for the\nsafety of all. The policies we have in place around demonstrations are in\nplace to support both the right to expression and the safety and functioning\nof our University.\n\nThank you for your assistance with this very challenging situation.\n\nSincerely, Minouche Shafik\n\nShare to Facebook Share to X Share to LinkedIn Share to Print\n\n##\n\nMorningside Campus:\n\nEmergency Line: 212-854-5555 Main Line: 212-854-2797\n\n##\n\nManhattanville Campus:\n\nEmergency Line: 212-853-3333 Main Line: 212-853-3301\n\n##\n\nMedical Center Campus:\n\nEmergency Line: 212-305-7979 Main Line: 212-305-8100\n\n##\n\nLamont-Doherty Campus:\n\nEmergency Line: 845-359-5555 Main Line: 845-359-2900\n\n##\n\nEmergency Announcements\n\nColumbia University Preparedness\n\nMorningside Campus: 212-854-2797535 West 116th Street, 101 Low Library, MC\n4301, New York, NY\n\nManhattanville Campus: 212-853-33013270 Broadway, New York, 10027\n\nMedical Center Campus: 212-305-8100 650 West 168th Street, 109 Black Building,\nNew York, NY, 10032\n\n## Contact Us\n\npublicsafety@columbia.edu\n\n## Follow Us\n\nFacebook Instagram\n\n  * A department of Columbia University Facilities and Operations\n\nColumbia University\n\n\u00a92024 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using\nColumbia Sites\n\nThis website uses cookies as well as similar tools and technologies to\nunderstand visitors' experiences.
