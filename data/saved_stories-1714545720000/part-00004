Walking several hours every day is an amazing\nroutine, and visiting every street is really the only way to experience a city\nto its fullest. So over the past decade I\u2019ve GPS-tracked over 35,000 miles of\nwalking in dozens of countries and cities.\n\nAt first I considered literally going the \u2018every street\u2019 route, in which I\ncross off every street of a given city. I haven\u2019t fully abandoned this goal,\nbut the thought of endless residential neighborhoods, freeways and frequent\ndead ends makes the idea unappealing. The goal of this project is to enjoy the\nexperience, and doubling-back on a cul-de-sac is not fun. So at the moment,\nthis project\u2019s goal is to walk \u2018every interesting street\u2019 of my favorite\ncities, with \u2018every street\u2019 TBD.\n\nI\u2019m still deciding what approach I want to take to sharing this data. The\ndrawback here is privacy, so I\u2019ve abandoned plans to make an interactive map.\nFor now I\u2019ll just manually update this page with a few of my favorite maps,\nlike some sort of art project.\n\nTo log the data, I have my iPhone passively track me in the background 24/7,\nwhich is easier than manually tracking my walking and also serves as evidence\nthat I walked all these streets.\n\nPeople frequently message me asking how to do this. It takes a surprising\namount of work to have your phone passively track you, so for most people I\u2019d\nrecommend just using a fitness tracker like Strava each time you go out.\nHowever, if you\u2019re committed, here are the steps.\n\n  * Install Arc (and maybe Arc Mini for backup) on your iPhone. The app will track you passively and use an AI model to clean up and classify the data.\n  * On a ~weekly basis, manually clean up the remaining data the model couldn\u2019t sort out.\n  * When you\u2019re ready, export the weekly or monthly JSON files to your computer and run this code to strip out everything but the walking.\n  * You now have a JSON file with just your walking data. You can visualize it on this site.\n\n### New York City\n\nNYC is one of the best cities in the world for walking. The city has so much\ngoing on that no matter where you walk there\u2019s always something happening to\nkeep it interesting. So far, I\u2019ve walked about 8,000 miles in NYC, of which\nmaybe 1,000 miles are unique streets \u2013 about 15% complete.\n\n### San Francisco\n\nSF is somehow both one of the best and one of the worst cities for walking.\nDepending on the day and neighborhood, it could be one of the most beautiful\nwalks you\u2019ve ever been on or one of the worst... Over the past decade I\u2019ve\nwalked around 7,000 miles in SF, of which maybe 700 miles are unique streets,\nputting me at around 70% completion. If I were to walk full time, I could\nfinish every street in this city in about a month. Realistically, I likely\nwon\u2019t finish it for a few more years.\n\n### Mexico City\n\nCDMX is one of the most enjoyable cities in the world to live in. Different\nneighborhoods visually look different and have completely different vibes,\nwhich is something very few other cities can say. I frequently compare this\ncity to NYC.\n\nI don\u2019t want to say I\u2019ll never be able to walk every street in CDMX, but\nconsidering how much larger it is than NYC I\u2019m keeping my expectations\nrealistic. The 2,000 miles I\u2019ve walked here is just a single digit percent.\nThat said, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I hold the walking record for this city.\n\n### Los Angeles\n\nI\u2019ve never lived in LA, but dozens of weekend trips have resulted in me\nwalking more of the city than most people who live here. It\u2019s really not a\nwalkable city.\n\nThough I don\u2019t see myself walking every street of LA, I would like to walk\nevery street of all the interesting neighborhoods and then connect them\ntogether!\n\n### Austin\n\nAustin is a terrible city for walking, like the rest of Texas, but everyone\nknows that. Sidewalks will just give up before leading anywhere. The only\nexception is the running trail loop alongside the Colorado river, which makes\nit easy to forget you\u2019re in Texas.\n\n### Oaxaca\n\nThough I\u2019ve only been to Oaxaca once, and only for six weeks, the resulting\nmap ended up looking great due to me walking the two main neighborhoods to\nnear completion. The city itself is a lot bigger, but is entirely residential\noutside of the central area so it\u2019s hard to find reasons to explore. Because\nof the thin, cobbled streets, walking is the best way to get around and is\noften faster than a taxi.\n\nThanks for checking this out! I plan to expand on this walking thing\neventually, already have 10,000 words worth of walking thoughts jotted down in\nmy notes over the years I\u2019d like to condense and add... Let me know if you\nliked this page/project and if there\u2019s enough interest I\u2019ll prioritize it!\n\n", "frontpage": false}
