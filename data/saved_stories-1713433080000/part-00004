Appimage (which I'm\ndownloading now), flatpak (which I was using), PPA. I also saw that 1.1 was\navailable as a Snap.Currently I was searching around for alternate\ninstallation ways for another game (starts with a W too) and while I was doing\nthat I noticed that Widelands has more ways. Nice.I'm on Debian btw which\nexplains why native packages are rarely a good choice. It's fine that Debian\nis ultra stable and lags but for current games it is a major pain. : ) I'm\nsure WL 1.2 will be natively available for Debian in a few centuries from now\n;- )I LOVE appimages btw. As an old 8-bit and DOS user there's nothing more\ngorgeous than having a real single executable file to run. (in case any other\noldies remember those days, yes yes some DOS programs needed all sorts of\nextra files but at least they usually were all lumped in one directory)Ahhh DL\nalmost done. I can stop now.  \n---|---  \n  \nmxb2001| You guys forgot to mention the bestest new feature: Road placement\npreviews when holding down CTRL!  \n---|---  \n  \nSirVer| Congratulations to everybody who contributed to this! Amazing, that\nWIdelands is still going strong after sooooo many years of development.  \n---|---  \n  \n### Reply to Original:\n\nLog in to post comments!\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2009 - 2024 By the Widelands Development Team Legal notice\n(contact) \u25cf Privacy Policy\n\n", "frontpage": false}
