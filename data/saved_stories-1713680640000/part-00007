Plants that fix\nnitrogen, such as legumes, do so by harboring symbiotic bacteria in root\nnodules. But a recent discovery upends that rule.\n\nIn two recent papers, an international team of scientists describe the first\nknown nitrogen-fixing organelle within a eukaryotic cell. The organelle is the\nfourth example in history of primary endosymbiosis \u2013 the process by which a\nprokaryotic cell is engulfed by a eukaryotic cell and evolves beyond symbiosis\ninto an organelle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very rare that organelles arise from these types of things,\u201d said Tyler\nCoale, a postdoctoral scholar at UC Santa Cruz and first author on one of two\nrecent papers. \u201cThe first time we think it happened, it gave rise to all\ncomplex life. Everything more complicated than a bacterial cell owes its\nexistence to that event,\u201d he said, referring to the origins of the\nmitochondria. \u201cA billion years ago or so, it happened again with the\nchloroplast, and that gave us plants,\u201d Coale said.\n\nThe third known instance involves a microbe similar to a chloroplast. The\norganelle in this discovery has been named a nitroplast.\n\n## A decades-long mystery\n\nThe discovery of the organelle involved a bit of luck and decades of work. In\n1998, Jonathan Zehr, a UC Santa Cruz distinguished professor of marine\nsciences, found a short DNA sequence of what appeared to be from an unknown\nnitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium in Pacific Ocean seawater. Zehr and colleagues\nspent years studying the mystery organism, which they called UCYN-A.\n\nAt the same time, Kyoko Hagino, a paleontologist at Kochi University in Japan,\nwas painstakingly trying to culture a marine alga. It turned out to be the\nhost organism for UCYN-A. It took her over 300 sampling expeditions and more\nthan a decade, but Hagino eventually successfully grew the alga in culture,\nallowing other researchers to begin studying UCYN-A and its marine alga host\ntogether in the lab.\n\nFor years, the scientists considered UCYN-A an endosymbiont that was closely\nassociated with an alga. But the two recent papers suggest that UCYN-A has co-\nevolved with its host past symbiosis and now fits criteria for an organelle.\n\n## Organelle origins\n\nIn a paper published in Cell in March, Zehr and colleagues from the\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, Institut de Ci\u00e8ncies del Mar in\nBarcelona and the University of Rhode Island show that the size ratio between\nUCYN-A and their algal hosts is similar across different species of the marine\nhaptophyte algae Braarudosphaera bigelowii.\n\nThe researchers use a model to demonstrate that the growth of the host cell\nand UCYN-A are controlled by the exchange of nutrients. Their metabolisms are\nlinked. This synchronization in growth rates led the researchers to call\nUCYN-A \u201corganelle-like.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what happens with organelles,\u201d said Zehr. \u201cIf you look at the\nmitochondria and the chloroplast, it\u2019s the same thing: they scale with the\ncell.\u201d\n\nBut the scientists did not confidently call UCYN-A an organelle until\nconfirming other lines of evidence. In the cover article of the journal\nScience, published last week, the UC Santa Cruz team and collaborators from\nLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), UC San Francisco,\nNational Taiwan Ocean University, and Kochi University in Japan show that\nUCYN-A relies on proteins from its host cells and that the organelle\u2019s process\nof replication and division is tightly paired with the algal cell\u2019s process.\n\n\u201cUntil this paper, there was still a question of is this still an\n\u2018endosymbiont\u2019, or has it become a true organelle?\u201d said co-author Carolyn\nLarabell, a senior faculty scientist in Berkeley Lab\u2019s Biosciences Area and\nDirector of the National Center for X-Ray Tomography. \u201cWe showed with X-ray\nimaging that the process of replication and division of the algal host and\nendosymbiont is synchronized, which provided the first strong evidence.\u201d\n\nLarabell has been collaborating with Zehr for several years to study the\nrelationship between UCYN-A and the alga using the advanced soft X-ray\ntomography approach she co-developed at Berkeley Lab\u2019s Advanced Light Source,\na particle accelerator that produces X-rays. Her technique allows scientists\nto rapidly visualize internal components of cells in real-time, under real-\nlife conditions.\n\nValentina Loconte, a research scientist in Larabell\u2019s group, performed the\ntomography on a large number of B. bigelowii cells, then analyzed the data to\ngenerate detailed images showing the organelle\u2019s movements within the alga at\nall stages of replication.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of our technology. We can get numbers to make quantitative\nstatements. We have numbers at each stage of the cell cycle to show that this\nisn\u2019t a quirk,\u201d said Larabell.\n\nMeanwhile, Coale compared proteins found within isolated UCYN-A with those\nfound in the entire algal host cell. He found that around half of the proteins\nin UCYN-A are made by the algal host cell, then labeled with a specific amino\nacid sequence, which tells the cell to send them to the nitroplast. The\nnitroplast then imports the proteins and uses them.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the hallmarks of something moving from an endosymbiont to an\norganelle,\u201d said Zehr. \u201cThey start throwing away pieces of DNA, and their\ngenomes get smaller and smaller, and they start depending on the mother cell\nfor those gene products \u2013 or the protein itself \u2013 to be transported into the\ncell.\u201d\n\nThis dependent relationship, taken together with the images of synchronized\ndivision, shows that UCYN-A deserves organelle status.\n\n## Changing perspectives\n\nWhile mitochondria and chloroplasts evolved billions of years ago, the\nnitroplast appears to have evolved about 100 million years ago, providing\nscientists with a new, more recent perspective on organellogenesis.\n\nThe organelle also provides insight into ocean ecosystems. All organisms need\nnitrogen in a biologically usable form, and rely on nitrogen fixers to break\napart tightly bound nitrogen gas (N_2) in the atmosphere, and convert it into\nammonia (NH_3) molecules that can then be made into countless other compounds.\nResearchers have found UCYN-A everywhere from the tropics to the Arctic Ocean,\nand it fixes a significant amount of nitrogen.\n\nThe discovery also has the potential to change agriculture. The ability to\nsynthesize ammonia fertilizers from atmospheric nitrogen allowed agriculture \u2013\nand the world population \u2013 to take off in the early 20th century. Known as the\nHaber-Bosch process, it makes possible about 50% of the world\u2019s food\nproduction. It also creates enormous amounts of carbon dioxide: about 1.4% of\nglobal emissions come from the process. For decades, researchers have tried to\nfigure out a way to incorporate natural nitrogen fixation into agriculture.\n\n\u201cThis system is a new perspective on nitrogen fixation, and it might provide\nclues into how such an organelle could be engineered into crop plants,\u201d said\nCoale.\n\nBut plenty of questions about UCYN-A and its algal host remain unanswered. The\nresearchers plan to delve deeper into how UCYN-A and the alga operate and\nstudy different strains.\n\nKendra Turk-Kubo, an assistant professor at UC Santa Cruz, will continue the\nresearch in her new lab. Zehr expects scientists will find other organisms\nwith evolutionary stories similar to UCYN-A, but as the first of its kind,\nthis discovery is one for the textbooks.\n\nThis research was funded by the Simons Foundation, National Institute of\nGeneral Medical Sciences, and the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science\nOffice of Biological and Environmental Research.
