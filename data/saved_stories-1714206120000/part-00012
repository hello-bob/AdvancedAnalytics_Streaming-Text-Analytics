(Answering the question of when Labor Day would be above)\n\n  * The only calibration to the actual system of time is that 00:00 is equal to 00:00 on January 1st. That covers us for time zones, daylight savings times, and such.\n\nSo this all raises some questions.\n\n##\n\nFacts\n\n  * One day is about 4 minutes.\n\n    * 3 minutes and 56.87671232876712 seconds to be more precise.\n\n  * The middle of the day is June 2nd.\n\n  * The 9-5 workday is mid-May to mid-September (May 17 - Sept 15).\n\n  * One hour is equal to about 15 days so a month takes about 2 hours.\n\n  * The shortest month is 2 hours and 1 minute long (February).\n\n  * The longest month is about 2 hours and 6 minutes (January, March, May, July, August, and October).\n\nTo further amuse myself, I built a clock that works exactly that way.
