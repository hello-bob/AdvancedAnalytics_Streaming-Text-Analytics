That\u2019s 'Scary' For The Rest Of The\nAuto Industry\n\n## Many EV buyers would buy a Chinese car if it was cheap enough, according to\na recent survey.\n\nApr 29, 2024 at 5:28pm ET\n\n24 Comments / 24 New\n\nTim Levin\n\nBy: Tim Levin\n\nLately, there\u2019s been a lot of talk about the impending wave of cheap Chinese\nelectric cars that may upend the U.S. auto market as we know it. Even Donald\nTrump waded into the topic recently when he predicted a \u201cbloodbath\u201d for\nAmerican manufacturing due to an influx of Chinese vehicles. If elected, he\nsaid, he\u2019d slap a 100% tariff on Chinese cars.\n\nAs bombastic and controversial as that statement was, Trump isn\u2019t totally off-\nbase. The rapid rise of China as a global exporter of high-quality, affordable\nelectric cars poses a real threat to established Western automakers, many of\nwhom are just starting to get their footing in the EV game.\n\nChinese electric cars are known for being affordable and also high-tech.\nWhat\u2019s more, it turns out that lots of Americans are open to buying them.\n\n### Get Fully Charged\n\nChinese EVs are likely coming to the U.S. soon\n\nChina has emerged as a powerhouse in the electric vehicle industry. Its\nhomegrown automakers are selling lots of cars that are both cheap and high-\nquality. Industry watchers say it's only a matter of time before those\ncompanies take aim at the U.S.\n\nIn a recent survey, the consulting firm AlixPartners asked Americans whether\nthey\u2019d buy a Chinese-brand EV if it was 20% cheaper than a comparable non-\nChinese car. Of those who said they were very or moderately likely to buy an\nelectric car for their next purchase, 73% answered yes.\n\nAnd yes, a discount that big is entirely possible. While EVs are still\nrelatively expensive in the U.S., years of government subsidies and\nmanufacturing experience have allowed Chinese companies to start producing EVs\non the cheap. The BYD Seagull hatchback, for example, starts at the equivalent\nof less than $10,000.\n\nFifty-eight percent of those same Americans who were likely to go electric\nsaid they had heard of at least one Chinese brand. BYD, the top seller of EVs\nin China (and sometimes the world, depending on the quarter), had the greatest\nawareness.\n\nThe BYD Seagull made waves when it was announced with a sub-$10,000 starting\nprice.\n\nChinese brands\u2019 solid awareness among Western buyers, technological advantages\nand competitive costs all add up to a looming problem for the Fords and\nVolkswagens of the world, said Arun Kumar, global co-leader of the Advanced\nMobility Practice at AlixPartners. China also dominates battery manufacturing.\n\"That just makes them more formidable competitors in the future, across all\nmarkets,\" he said. Moreover, younger buyers also have an even greater deal of\nChinese auto brand awareness, the study showed.\n\nGerman, Japanese and then Korean automakers entered the U.S. market decades\nago with cheap, basic vehicles and improved quality slowly over time. Chinese\nEV manufacturers, on the other hand, are already five to 10 years ahead of\ntheir American and European rivals, Kumar said. A lot of that is thanks to\naggressive investments in the EV industry from the Chinese government.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what makes it scary\" for car manufacturers, he said. \u201cThe game is\nbeing played differently.\u201d\n\nHe said he thinks the Xiaomi SU7, for example, would sell well in Europe or\nAmerica. The tech giant\u2019s first car starts at under $30,000 in China and\nadvertises a smartphone-like operating system. Nio, a startup, demonstrated a\nnext-generation EV battery chemistry that can propel a car for a whopping 650\nmiles, he noted.\n\nThe SU7 is Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi's first vehicle.\n\nSeveral Chinese brands have begun selling cars across Europe. But they aren't\nin the U.S. yet. We do get some Chinese-made vehicles, like the Polestar 2 and\nthe upcoming Volvo EX30, but those aren't from homegrown brands. There\u2019s\nreason to believe that China\u2019s lead over the rest of the world will persist.\nAnd that comes down to piping hot EV demand in the country, Kumar said.\n\nThirty-five percent of Americans surveyed by AlixPartners said they were very\nor moderately likely to buy an EV as their next vehicle. Forty-eight percent\nsaid they were likely to buy one by 2035. Those are rookie numbers compared to\nwhat's going on in China.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your\ninbox.\n\nThere, an astonishing 97% of respondents said their next car would likely be\nan EV. That voracious appetite drives greater manufacturing volumes, which in\nturn justify aggressive investments in keeping EV technology fresh, Kumar\nsaid. By 2035, Chinese firms could be two or three vehicle generations ahead\nof rivals when it comes to EV technology, he said. Western companies risk\nfalling behind if they can\u2019t scale up quickly.\n\nThere are hurdles standing in the Chinese automakers\u2019 way. Concerns about\nreliability, quality and the prevalence of service centers could keep U.S.\nbuyers at bay, AlixPartners found. Geopolitical tensions are also at play.\nChina is an adversarial nation, unlike South Korea or Japan. Hence the fiery\nrhetoric around huge tariffs from Trump and others.\n\nTwo big remaining questions are how Chinese brands will enter the U.S. and how\npolitical viewpoints around them will shift over time, Kumar said.\n\nBut at the end of the day, he told InsideEVs, \u201cif you have a compelling\nproduct and it\u2019s cheaper, it\u2019s tough from an economic sense to keep those\nvehicles out.\u201d\n\nContact the author: tim.levin@insideevs.com\n\nMore Chinese EV Stuff\n\n2024 BYD Seal Review: If You Could Buy One, You'd Probably Want To\n\nBYD Shark Is China\u2019s New Plug-In Hybrid Pickup Truck\n\nCATL\u2019s Latest LFP Battery Can Gain 370 Miles Of Range In 10 Minutes Of\nCharging\n\nElon Musk Goes To China, Brings Home A Win For Tesla's Full Self-Driving\n\n++\n\n  * Share on Facebook\n  * Share on Twitter\n  * Share on LinkedIn\n  * Share on Flipboard\n  * Share on Reddit\n  * Share on WhatsApp\n  * Send to email\n\n### Top comments\n\nTom99 30 avr. 2024, 03:53\n\nCan we quit acting like those Chinese cars will be anywhere near as cheap\noutside China? Based on the Chinese EVs being sold in Europe, South America,\nand Australia, the prices will be quite a bit higher. So that Xiaomi SU7 that\nsells for $30k in China is going to come in above $40k -- and at that price,\nit's no longer undercutting Tesla, Hyundai, Ford, VW, etc.\n\nAMortalDefiant 30 avr. 2024, 13:50\n\nWhile we're at it, can we stop pretending the Chinese won't do what they do\nevery time they are slapped with tariffs: build in Mexico, and circumvent\nthem? Sure, directly imported cars would cost a lot more, but ones built in\nMexico? Not so much. The Chinese will pull the same fast one on their US\ncompetition that has worked for them 100% of the time so far. Tariffs are not\na solution. They are like putting a Band-Aid on a femoral artery bleed; they\nwill buy us a few milliseconds of time, at best.\n\ntimlevin 30 avr. 2024, 13:25\n\nFor sure. You're right about that. For what it's worth, Arun Kumar did specify\nthat he thought the SU7 would do well outside of China at a price of $40-$50k.\n\nSo I think regardless of the exact price, there's a good chance these cars\nwill be very competitive on price and appeal.\n\nAMortalDefiant 30 avr. 2024, 13:54\n\nSure they will. Like every other product, they will just just flood the US\nmarket via Mexico, and completely bypass all tariffs that people like Trump\nput up to act tough (but not actually accomplish anything). Capitalism does\nnot cease to function simply because a country some do not like is the one\nselling the goods. People will go for perceived to value. The solution is not\ntariffs, but for local brands to actually make a serious attempt to make\ncompetitive EVs at competitive prices. Using the law (tariffs, bans, etc.) in\nlieu of making a better product never works out in the end.\n\nWe all pretend to love capitalism until someone *else* makes a better product\nfor less; then we use anti-competition legislation to prevent a free market,\nand crown our corporate kings. The solution is to just be stronger\ncompetitors; not continue to keep asking the referees to rig the game in your\nfavor.\n\nYTD, Geely-Volvo already has ~10% of the BEV market in Europe, *despite*\nhaving no local production.\n\nModernMarvelFan 1 mai 2024, 06:28\n\nDon't think for a second that Congress won't come up with some \"security\"\nexcuse to ban all Chinese car companies if that happens. If one thinks the so\ncalled \"data security\" in some tik tok app, just imagine what they will spin\non so called data with EV, especially when it has network access and cameras.\n\nAJ Minhas 30 avr. 2024, 12:57\n\nThe Chinese are already planning an EV invasion of the US via Mexico. They\nwill establish a beachhead in Mexico, where they can use NAFTA to manufacture\nEVs in factories in Mexico and then bypass the tariffs and restrictions into\nthe US. This is their long-game. They have already taken over the computer\nindustry and now it's time for EVs. EVs are basically smartphones on wheels.\nThe American car makers haven't figured that out yet. The Chinese dominate the\nsmartphone market, too. It's a matter of when and not if the Chinese start\nselling their EVs here in the US. Cheers.\n\nRichard Slay 30 avr. 2024, 19:30\n\nFunny how we didn't go to trade war to save our computer companies or our TV\nset companies or their union workers, but now that it's automobiles (running\non gasoline), everything China does is an existential threat of Communist\nenslavement.\n\nWhy, it's almost as if politicians and their parties are especially beholden\nto certain free-donating capitalist industries and we really never had Free\nEnterprise.\n\nJoin the conversation 24 Comments / 24 New\n\nGot a tip for us?
