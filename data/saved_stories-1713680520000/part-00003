Reverse-DNS strings are based on registered domain names,\nwith the order of the components reversed for grouping purposes. For example,\nif a company making the product \"MyProduct\" has the domain name example.com,\nthey could use the reverse-DNS string com.example.MyProduct as an identifier\nfor that product. Reverse-DNS names are a simple way of eliminating namespace\ncollisions, since any domain name is globally unique to its registered owner.\n\n## History[edit]\n\nThe first appearance of reversed DNS strings predated the Internet domain name\nstandards. The UK Joint Academic Networking Team (JANET) used this order in\nits Name Registration Scheme, before the Internet domain name standard was\nestablished. For example, the name uk.ac.bris.pys.as was interpreted as a host\nnamed as within the UK (top level domain .uk), while the Internet standard\nwould have interpreted it as a host named uk within the American Samoa top\nlevel domain (.as). During the period while both JANET-style and Internet-\nstyle addresses were in use, mailers and gateway sites had ad-hoc workarounds\nto handle the differences, but could still be confused.\n\nReverse-DNS for identifier strings first became widely used with the Java\nplatform.^[citation needed]\n\n## Examples[edit]\n\nExamples of systems that use reverse-DNS notation are:\n\n  * Sun Microsystems' Java platform for namespaces\n  * Apple's Uniform Type Identifier (UTI)^[1]\n  * The Android operating system, for classifying applications (because the Dalvik virtual machine was based on Java)\n  * dconf, the configuration backend used by GNOME\n  * The freedesktop.org Desktop Entry Specification^[2]\n  * iSCSI Qualified Naming\n\nSome examples of reverse-DNS strings are:\n\n  * com.adobe.postscript-font, UTI string for Adobe Systems's PostScript fonts\n  * com.apple.ostype, UTI string for Apple's OSType\n  * org.omg.CORBA, Java library for CORBA\n  * org.w3c.dom, Java library for W3C's DOM\n  * org.kde.dolphin.desktop, a desktop file name\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Non-Internet email address\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"Apple Developer Connection: Introduction to Uniform Type Identifiers Overview\". 2005-11-09.
