Named after\nThomas J. Beale, who purportedly buried the trove, the Beale Treasure of gold\nand silver and jewels has languished in the ground for two centuries. The only\nclue to its whereabouts is a three page coded message known as the Beale\nCiphers.\n\nThe Beale Treasure pertains to millions of dollars of gold, silver, and jewels\nallegedly buried in the mountains of Bedford County, VA.\n\nThe story has fascinated people and treasure hunters since 1885 when James B.\nWard published a pamphlet called \u201cThe Beale Papers,\u201d written by an anonymous\nperson who acquired the Beale Cipher from a hotel proprietor named Robert\nMorriss.\n\n### Thomas J. Beale and Robert Morriss\n\nThe story begins in January 1820, when Thomas J. Beale checked into the\nWashington Hotel in Lynchburg, Virginia. Beale told the proprietor, Robert\nMorriss, that he was from Virginia. He was with two other men, all of whom\nappeared to be gentlemen of substance. The two other men left a few days later\nbound for Richmond, but Beale remained through the winter.\n\nRelated: Oak Island: Legends of Pirate and Treasure\n\nAccording to Morriss, Beale was a pleasant guest. Other hotel tenants found\nhim to be popular, especially the women. A good listener, he revealed little\nabout himself. Beale mention being familiar with southwestern Virginia, north\nof Roanoke. That fact became significant later.\n\nIn March 1820, Beale\u2019s two friends returned, and after a few days, the three\nof them departed. Nearly two years later, during the winter of 1822, Thomas\nBeale returned to the Washington Hotel, where Robert Moriss welcomed him. The\nwinter passed quietly.\n\n### Iron Box\n\nIn March of 1822, Beale called the innkeeper to his room. He pulled out a\nlocked iron box and gave it to Morriss. Beale emphasized the box\u2019s importance\nand requested the proprietor keep it safe until Beale returned. Moriss stored\nit away and forgot about it until he received a letter from Beale, dated May\n9, 1822. Beale was in St. Louis at the time he sent the letter.\n\n### Letter and the Ciphers\n\nIn this letter, Beale told Morriss the box contained papers upon which the\nfortunes of many men depended. Three of the documents were written in cipher,\nrequiring a key to interpret. Beale promised he would leave the information\nneeded to analyze the ciphers with a friend in St. Louis and, should he never\nreturn, the friend would mail that envelope to Lynchburg in 1832. He asked\nMorriss to open the box on that year if he never heard from Beale again.\n\nThe Beale Ciphers consisted of these three cryptograms.\n\nBeale disappeared. Morriss occasionally thought about the box, but he waited\nuntil 1845 to break open the lock since the key to the ciphers never arrived.\nThe box contained three sets of papers, totally unintelligible with numbers\ncarefully printed on them. It also included another letter from Beale, written\nin January of 1822, shortly after returning to Lynchburg.\n\n### The Story\n\nBeale\u2019s letter provides some background to this alleged treasure. In 1817, a\ngroup of thirty young, affluent, and well-educated men set out from Virginia\nto find adventure in the West. They traveled to St. Louis, where they geared\nup for buffalo and bear hunting. They employed guides, who advised to organize\nthemselves as if they were a military unit. They elected Beale as the leader.\n\nThe group proceeded on to Santa Fe, where they stayed the winter. On a\nbuffalo-hunting expedition a couple of hundred miles north of Santa Fe, some\nof the young men discovered a vein of gold. They spent the next two years\nexcavating the gold as well as some silver they found.\n\nBecause they were in a dangerous land, they decided to send the treasure back\nwith Beale to Virginia to hide in a cave near Buford\u2019s Tavern in Buford, not\nfar from Roanoke. The first time Beale arrived in Lynchburg, he buried half\nthe treasure. But not in the cave, because farmers utilized the cave for\nstorage. When he appeared at the Washington Hotel in January of 1822, he\nburied the remaining treasure in the same place.\n\n### Deciphering the Secrets of the Beale Ciphers\n\nRobert Morriss spent many hours of his life trying to decipher the cryptograms\nwithout success. In 1862, he passed the burden on to a young man whose\nidentity remains anonymous. Morriss died the next year. This unidentified man\nspent the next twenty-three years trying to unlock the secrets of the Beale\nCiphers. Ultimately, he unlocked the key to one of the three. The key was the\nDeclaration of Independence.\n\nRelated: Top Ten Lost Treasure of the World\n\nFinding the key stemmed from the letter J in Beale\u2019s middle name. Some say it\nis Jefferson. The anonymous person decided to use the Declaration of\nIndependence as the key because the primary author was Thomas Jefferson, whom\nThomas Jefferson Beale was most likely named after. It worked for the second\ncipher. It read:\n\n[blockquote align=\u201dnone\u201d author=\u201d\u201d]I have deposited in the county of Bedford,\nabout four miles from Buford\u2019s, in an excavation or vault, six feet below the\nsurface of the ground, the following articles, belonging jointly to the\nparties whose names are given in number three, herewith:[/blockquote]\n\nIt described the treasure as 2921 pounds of gold, 5100 pounds of silver, and\n$1,500,000 in precious gems packed in iron pots and covered in stone.\n\nIn today\u2019s economy, its value totals over $60,000,000.\n\nThe other two ciphers, allegedly detailing the adventurers\u2019 names, their\nimmediate heirs, and, more importantly, the location of the treasure.\n\nThey both remain undeciphered. At least, no one has ever admitted to breaking\nthe code.\n\n### Searching for Buried Treasure\n\nThe unknown friend, who Robert Moriss gave the papers, finally admitted defeat\nand handed the documents to James B. Ward. Mr. Ward decided to go public with\nthe Beale treasure.\n\nJames Ward wrote his pamphlet on the Beale Papers in 1885. While most of it\nburned in a warehouse fire, enough copies circulated to excite quite a few\npeople. Since 1885, hundreds of treasure hunters have descended to the\nMontvale, Virginia area, which used to be Buford. They used shovels, picks,\nmetal detectors, backhoes, even dynamite in their search. Prospectors even\nconsulted mediums and astrologers. Some of the best cryptoanalysts in the\nworld have devoted their time to trying to break the code. The Beale Ciphers\nare still unbroken.\n\nJames B. Ward\u2019s pamphlet on Amazon: The Beale Papers: Containing Authentic\nStatements Regarding The Treasure Buried 1819 and 1821, Bufords, in Bedford\nCounty, Virginia, Which has Never Been Recovered.\n\n### Real or Hoax?\n\nThe Beale treasure remains unaccounted for, at least as far as we know. Some\ntheorists suggest someone dug up the treasure long ago. Others believe the\nwhole thing is a hoax. They point to similarities in the writing of Beale and\nJames B. Ward, the pamphleteer. Beale\u2019s letters contain words that were not in\nthe English lexicon in 1820.\n\nAn attempt to identify Mr. Beale by looking at the 1820 census proved\nunsuccessful. The census listed two males with the last name Beale.\nUnfortunately, missing data from three other states made this search\nfruitless.\n\nUntil officially debunked, people will continue to believe that over\n$60,000,000 in gold, silver, and jewels lies buried in the Blue Ridge\nMountains. It drives them to repeated attempts to break the code and find the\ntreasure.\n\n##### Joshua\n\nA full time college student with a passion for history.
