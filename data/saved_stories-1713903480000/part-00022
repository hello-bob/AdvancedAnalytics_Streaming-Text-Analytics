Without treatment, these\nconditions can become chronic, harming lake ecosystems and those who depend on\nthem. More than 12% of the world\u2019s human population, for instance, lives\nwithin 3 kilometers of a lake.\n\n## This newsletter rocks.\n\nGet the most fascinating science news stories of the week in your inbox every\nFriday.\n\nSign up now\n\nIn a new study, Weyhenmeyer et al. suggest using human health terminology and\napproaches to assess and treat the world\u2019s lake system issues. For example,\nlakes with multiple health problems could be characterized as having\n\u201cmultimorbidity,\u201d and regular screenings similar to human checkups could help\ndetect issues in lakes early. These anthropomorphic analogies, the researchers\nreport, may help people better connect with and protect nature.\n\nSome high-income countries have methods to assess lake health, but the team\nintroduced a global classification system modeled after the World Health\nOrganization\u2019s human health classification system. They used data from\nLakeATLAS for nearly 1.5 million lakes worldwide to examine lake maladies of\nthe circulatory (such as flooding and drying out), metabolic (such as\nacidification and salinization), nutritional, and respiratory varieties\u2014along\nwith other types of disturbances. Researchers categorized lake health from\nexcellent to critical. Around 115,000 lakes evaporate twice as much water as\nthey receive, putting more than 153 million people who live near these lakes\nat risk.\n\nSome lake health symptoms, such as algal blooms, fish kills, and floating\npollution, are readily visible via processes like satellite observation. But\nother concerns can be revealed only with diagnostic tests, which, like\ndiagnostic tests for humans, can be expensive.\n\nThe team recommended additional screening, including testing water samples or\ninstalling inexpensive sensors, to get a fuller picture of health. They also\nnoted that many lake health issues are widely recognized but not yet treated,\nespecially in lower-income countries. They stressed that there is an urgent\nneed to start coordinated, multidisciplinary treatments for unhealthy lakes so\nconditions do not become chronic or critical. In particular, treating sewage\nwater, mitigating climate change, and counteracting damage done by humans and\nnonnative species should be prioritized.
