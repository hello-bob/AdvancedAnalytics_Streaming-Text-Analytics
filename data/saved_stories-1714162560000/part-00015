But of course\nthey aren\u2019t; they\u2019re burying \u201cconsent\u201d deep in the mire of some hundred-page\nend user agreement nobody reads, usually not related to the car purchase \u2014 but\nthe apps consumers use to manage roadside assistance and other features.\n\nSince Kashmir\u2019s story was published, she says she\u2019s been inundated with\ncomplaints by consumers about similar behavior. She\u2019s even discovered that\nshe\u2019s one of the folks GM spied on and tattled to insurers about. In a follow\nup story, she recounts how she and her husband bought a Chevy Bolt, were auto-\nenrolled in a driver assistance program, then had their data (which they\ncouldn\u2019t access) sold to insurers.\n\nGM\u2019s now facing 10 different federal lawsuits from customers pissed off that\nthey were surreptitiously tracked and then forced to pay significantly more\nfor insurance:\n\n> \u201cIn 10 federal lawsuits filed in the last month, drivers from across the\n> country say they did not knowingly sign up for Smart Driver but recently\n> learned that G.M. had provided their driving data to LexisNexis. According\n> to one of the complaints, a Florida owner of a 2019 Cadillac CTS-V who drove\n> it around a racetrack for events saw his insurance premium nearly double, an\n> increase of more than $5,000 per year.\u201d\n\nGM (and some apologists) will of course proclaim that this is only fair that\nreckless drivers pay more, but that\u2019s generally not how it works. Pressured\nfor unlimited quarterly returns, insurance companies will use absolutely\nanything they find in the data to justify rising rates.\n\nAnd as the sector is getting automated by sloppy AI, those determinations\naren\u2019t going to go in your favor (see: AI\u2019s rushed implementation in\nhealthcare). That\u2019s before the fact that consumers aren\u2019t being told about the\nsurveillance, and aren\u2019t given a clear option to stop it. Or that the data is\nalso being sold to a litany of dodgy data brokers who, in turn, see minimal\noversight.\n\nIf this follows historical precedent, GM will pay out a relative pittance in\nlegal fees and fines, claim they\u2019ve changed their behavior, then simply rename\nthese programs into something else after heavy consultation with their legal\ndepartment. Something more carefully crafted, with bare-bones consumer alerts,\nto exploit the fact that the U.S. remains too corrupt to pass even a baseline\nmodern privacy law.\n\nAutomakers \u2014 which have long had some of the worst privacy reputations in all\nof tech \u2014 are one of countless industries that lobbied relentlessly for\ndecades to ensure Congress never passed a federal privacy law or regulated\ndodgy data brokers. And that the FTC \u2014 the over-burdened regulator tasked with\nprivacy oversight \u2014 lacks the staff, resources, or legal authority to police\nthe problem at any real scale.\n\nThe end result is just a parade of scandals. And if Hill were so inclined, she\ncould write a similar story about every tech sector in America, given\neverything from your smart TV and electricity meter to refrigerator and kids\u2019\ntoys now monitor your behavior and sell access to those insights to a wide\nrange of dodgy data broker middlemen, all with nothing remotely close to\nethics or competent oversight.\n\nAnd despite the fact that this free for all environment is resulting in no\nlimit of dangerous real-world harms, our Congress has been lobbied into\ngridlock by a cross-industry coalition of companies with near-unlimited\nbudgets, all desperately hoping that their performative concerns about TikTok\nwill distract everyone from the fact we live in a country too corrupt to pass\na real privacy law.\n\nFiled Under: auto, auto insurance, auto insurance rates, car, data brokers,\nprivacy, surveillance Companies: gm\n\n16 CommentsLeave a Comment\n\nIf you liked this post, you may also be interested in...\n\n  * Grindr Hit By UK Lawsuit For Reckless Sale Of Sensitive User Data\n  * Any Privacy Law Is Going To Require Some Compromise: Is APRA The Right Set Of Tradeoffs?\n  * Senate Approves Section 702 Reauthorization, Keeps Only The Bad Stuff\n  * 96% Of Hospitals Share Sensitive Visitor Data With Meta, Google, and Data Brokers\n  * Senate Must Follow House's Lead In Passing Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act\n\nClick to toggle\n\nRate this comment as insightful\n\nRate this comment as funny\n\nYou have rated this comment as insightful\n\nYou have rated this comment as funny\n\nFlag this comment as abusive/trolling/spam\n\nYou have flagged this comment\n\nThe first word has already been claimed\n\nThe last word has already been claimed\n\n## Comments on \u201cPeople Are Slowly Realizing Their Auto Insurance Rates Are\nSkyrocketing Because Their Car Is Covertly Spying On Them\u201d\n\nSubscribe: RSS Leave a comment\n\n16 Comments\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nHOT USA FREEBIES (profile) says:\n\nApril 26, 2024 at 5:30 am\n\nAgree 100%\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nAnonymous Coward says:\n\nApril 26, 2024 at 5:36 am\n\n> GM (and some apologists) will of course proclaim that this is only fair that\n> reckless drivers pay more...\n\nIt is fair they pay more.

Naaah.\n\nI drive very little compared to most, and if the assertion that an individual\ncan be priced on behavior holds, I\u2019d pay a fraction of the usual rate. What\nwould that do to the base rate? I expect you\u2019d pay more under such a system.\nHowever, all the efforts to reward insurance companies to charge by miles\ndriven have failed. The base price is all the discount anyone gets. Further,\nthe industry already has a mechanism to charge more for high risk: ask any\nteenager or someone who has cost their insurance company money. The notion\nthat high risk drivers pay more is already baked into the policy rates.\nInsurance pools run on a statistic, and until we are all tracked, charging\nindividuals (vs statistical classes) is just gouging I think.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nKoby (profile) says:\n\nApril 26, 2024 at 7:07 am\n\n# Popular Demand\n\nNo wonder automakers fear right to repair laws.

The big machines needed a big burst and leaked a lot of x-rays. That's why the dentist had to hide behind the lead wall and we covered the reproductive organs - the dose wasn't bad once every six months, but multiple times a day would be serious. And the units therefore needed to be mounted. The handheld units better direct a much lower dose, and manufacturers claim technicians do not get dangerous doses of stray x-rays. That said, the notable property of x-rays is penetration. Many of the units I've seen have a guard as you describe, but nothing opaque, and if its not opaque its not lined with enough lead to matter.\n  * John Roddy: Lead lined glass is almost certainly more than enough to at least scatter any stray x-rays that find their way back.\n  * But yeah, x-ray tech in general got a pretty significant overhaul in the past decade or so.\n  * When Chandra launched in '99, it was the heaviest payload the shuttle ever carried.\n  * Fast forward to '21, and we've got IXPE.\n  * Chandra is close to 6,000kg.\n  * IXPE is just over 300.\n  * mildconcern: I wonder how much the general advancement of detectors driven by the cell phone camera revolution has spilled over. That certainly has helped the field of astronomical detection quite a bit.\n  * Digital sensors that had laughable resolution used to cost a fortune in the 1990s when they started to come out. And now you can get miracle devices for far less.\n  * John Roddy: Cell phone stuff is all in the microwave range.\n  * That's most useful for detecting the cosmic microwave background, which is probably the closest thing to a natural encyclopedia we're ever going to get.\n  * mildconcern: phone cameras also do sense visual light\n  * John Roddy: I feel like everyone I tell this to is hearing it for the first time, but...\n  * I *thought* it was common knowledge that your phone camera is pretty good at seeing infrared too.\n  * It's a really quick and easy way to check if a remote control is working.\n  * Infrared LEDs *will* be visible through the sensor.\n  * mildconcern: Oh yeah I knew that, I was just being a wiseass\n  * it's not hugely far in the infrared spectrum\n  * can't use it as a heat detector or something.
