Budding\nengineers serve on the RAS board of directors, have voting privileges, and\nwork within technical committees.\n\n\u201cThey have been given a voice in how the society runs because, in the end,\nstudents are among the main beneficiaries,\u201d says Enrica Tricomi, chair of the\nRAS\u2019s student activities committee. The SAC is responsible for student\nprograms and benefits. It also makes recommendations to the society\u2019s board\nabout new offerings.\n\n### A Guide for Inspiring the Next Generation Roboticists\n\nIEEE\n\nThe IEEE Robotics and Automation Society isn\u2019t focused only on boosting its\nstudent membership. It also wants to get more young people interested in\npursuing a robotics career. One way the society\u2019s volunteers try to inspire\nthe next generation of roboticists is through IEEE Spectrum\u2019s award-winning\nRobots website. The interactive guide features more than 250 real-world\nrobots, with thousands of photos, videos, and exclusive interactives, plus\nnews and detailed technical specifications.\n\nThe site is designed for anyone interested in robotics, including expert and\nbeginner enthusiasts, researchers, entrepreneurs, students, STEM educators,\nand other teachers.\n\nSchools and students across the globe use the site. Volunteers on the RAS\nsteering committee suggest robots to add, and they help support new content\ncreation on the site.\n\n\u201cYou feel listened to and valued whenever there are official decisions to be\nmade, because the board also wants to know the perspective of students on how\nto offer benefits to the RAS members, especially for young researchers, since\nhopefully they will be the society\u2019s future leaders,\u201d says Tricomi, a\nbioengineer who is pursuing a Ph.D. in robotics at Heidelberg University, in\nGermany.\n\nThe society\u2019s approach has paid off. Since 2018, student membership has grown\nby more than 50 percent to 5,436. The number of society chapters at student\nbranches has increased from 312 in 2021 to 450.\n\nThe ability to express opinions isn\u2019t the only reason students are joining,\nTricomi says. The society recently launched several programs to engage them,\nincluding career fairs, travel grants, and networking opportunities with\nresearchers.\n\n## Giving students leadership opportunities\n\nAs SAC chair, Tricomi is a voting member of RAS\u2019s administrative committee,\nwhich oversees the society\u2019s operations. She says having voting privileges\nshows \u201chow important it is to the society to have student representation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe receive a lot of support from the highest levels of the society,\nspecifically the society president, Aude Billard, and past president Frank\nChongwoo Park,\u201d Tricomi says. \u201cRAS boards have been rejuvenated to engage\nstudents even more and represent their voices. The chairs of these\nboards\u2014including technical activities, conference activities, and publication\nactivities\u2014want to know the SAC chair and cochairs\u2019 opinion on whether the new\nactivities are benefiting students.\u201d\n\nStudent members now can serve on IEEE technical committees that involve\nrobotics in the role of student representatives.\n\nThat was an initiative from Kyujin Cho, IEEE Technical Activities vice\npresident. Tricomi says the designation benefits young engineers because they\nlearn about ongoing research in their field and because they have direct\naccess to researchers.\n\nStudent representatives also help organize conference workshops.\n\nThe students had a hand in creating a welcome kit for conference attendees.\nThe initiative, led by Amy Kyungwon Han, Technical Activities associate vice\npresident, lists each day\u2019s activities and their location.\n\n\u201cI think that all of us, especially those who are younger, can actively\ncontribute and make a difference not only for the society and for ourselves\nbut also for our peers.\u201d\n\nBeing engaged with the technical topic in which the students work provides\nthem with career growth, visibility in their field, and an opportunity to\nshare their point of view with peers, Tricomi says.\n\n\u201cBeing young, the first time that you express your opinion in public, you\nalways feel uncomfortable because you don\u2019t have much experience,\u201d she says.\n\u201cThis is the opposite of the message the society wants to send. We want to\nlisten to students\u2019 voices because they are an important part of the society.\u201d\n\nTricomi herself recently became a member of the Technical Activities board.\n\nShe joined, she says, because \u201cthis is kind of a technical family by choice.\nAnd you want to be active and contribute to your family, right? I think that\nall of us, especially those who are younger, can actively contribute and make\na difference not only for the society and for ourselves but also for our\npeers.\u201d\n\n## Job fairs and travel grants\n\nSeveral new initiatives have been rolled out at the society\u2019s flagship\nconferences. The meetings have always included onsite events for students to\nnetwork with each other and to mingle with researchers over lunch. The events\ngive the budding engineers an opportunity to talk with leaders they normally\nwouldn\u2019t meet, Tricomi says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much appreciated, especially by very young or shy students,\u201d she says.\n\nSome luncheons have included sessions on career advice from leaders in\nacademia and industry, or from startup founders\u2014giving the students a sense of\nwhat it\u2019s like to work for such organizations.\n\nConferences now include career fairs, where students can meet with hiring\ncompanies.\n\nThe society also developed a software platform that allows candidates to\nupload their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 onsite. If they are a match for an open position,\ninterviews can be held on the spot.\n\nA variety of travel grants have been made available to students with limited\nresources so they can present their research papers at the society\u2019s major\nconferences. More than 200 travel grants were awarded to the 2023 IEEE\nInternational Conference on Robotics and Automation, Tricomi says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important for them to be there, presenting their work, gaining\nvisibility, sharing their research, and also networking,\u201d she says.\n\nThe new IDEA (inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility)travel grant for\nunderrepresented groups was established by the society\u2019sIEEE Women in\nEngineering committee and its chair, Karinne Ramirez Amaro. The grant can help\nstudents who are not presenters to attend conferences. It also helps increase\ndiversity within the robotics field, Tricomi says.\n\nThe Member Support Program is a newinitiative from the RAS member activities\nboard\u2019s vice president, Katja Mombaur, and past vice president Stefano\nStramigioli. Financial support to attend the annual International Conference\non Intelligent Robots and Systems is available to members and students who\nhave contributed to the society\u2019s mission-related activities. The projects\ninclude organizing workshops, discussions, lectures, or networking events at\nconferences or sponsored events; serving on boards or committees; or writing\npapers that were accepted for publication by conferences or journals.\n\nThe society also gets budding engineers involved in publication activities\nthrough its Young Reviewers Program, which introduces them to best practices\nfor peer review. Senior reviewers assign the students papers to check and\noversee their work.\n\n## Personal and professional growth opportunities\n\nTricomi joined the society in 2021 shortly after starting her Ph.D. program at\nHeidelberg. Her research is in wearable assistive robotics for human\naugmentation or rehabilitation purposes. She holds a master\u2019s degree in\nbiomedical engineering fromPolitecnico di Torino, in Italy.\n\nShe was new to the field of robotics, so her Ph.D. advisor, IEEE Senior Member\nLorenzo Masia, encouraged her to volunteer for the society. She is now\ntransitioning to the role of SAC senior chair, and she says she is eager to\ncollaborate with the new team to promote student and early career engagement\nwithin the robotics field.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve realized I\u2019ve grown up a lot in the two years since I started as chair,\u201d\nshe says. \u201cAt the beginning, I was much shier. I really want my colleagues to\nexperience the same personal and professional growth as I have. You learn not\nonly technical skills but also soft skills, which are very important in your\ncareer.\u201d\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * Free Travel Is the Main Perk for IEEE Programming Contest\u2019s Winners \u203a\n  * Ham Radio Inspired This Scranton University Student to Pursue Engineering \u203a\n  * Summit Shares Best Practices for Attracting Students to STEM \u203a\n\nieee member newsieee robotics and automation societyroboticsrobotsrobots\nguidestudentstype:ti\n\nKathy Pretz\n\nis editor in chief for The Institute, which covers all aspects of IEEE, its\nmembers, and the technology they're involved in.
