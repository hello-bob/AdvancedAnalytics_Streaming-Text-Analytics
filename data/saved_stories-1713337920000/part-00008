An ominous post on\nthe official YouTube Community Help forum titled \"Enforcement on Third Party\nApps\" says the company is \"strengthening our enforcement on third-party apps\nthat violate YouTube\u2019s Terms of Service, specifically ad-blocking apps.\"\nGoogle would really like it if you all paid for YouTube Premium.\n\nYouTube has been coming down on third-party apps, which often enable YouTube\nad blocking. The company shut down one of the most popular third-party apps,\n\"YouTube Vanced,\" in 2022. Vanced was open source, though, so new alternatives\nsprung up almost immediately. Vanced takes the official YouTube Android client\nand installs a duplicate, alternative version with a bunch of patches. It\nturns on all the YouTube Premium features like ad-blocking, background\nplayback, and downloading without paying for the Premium sub. It also adds\nfeatures the official app doesn't have, like additional themes and\naccessibility features, \"repeat\" and \"dislike\" buttons, and the ability to\nturn off addictive \"suggestions\" that appear all over the app.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Further Reading\n\nGoogle shuts down YouTube Vanced, a popular ad-blocking Android app\n\nAnother popular option is \"NewPipe,\" a from-scratch YouTube player that\nfollows the open source ethos and is available on the FOSS-only store F-Droid.\nNewPipe wants a lightweight client without the proprietary code and million\npermissions that YouTube needs, but it also blocks ads.\n\nRather than going after the projects, Google says it's going to start\ndisrupting users who are using these apps. The post writes, \"Viewers who are\nusing these third-party apps may experience buffering issues or see the error\n'The following content is not available on this app' when trying to watch a\nvideo.\" The company continues: \"We want to emphasize that our terms don\u2019t\nallow third-party apps to turn off ads because that prevents the creator from\nbeing rewarded for viewership, and Ads on YouTube help support creators and\nlet billions of people around the world use the streaming service.\"\n\nIf you remember back to when Google aggressively fought to keep third-party\nYouTube apps off of Windows Phone, the company seemed to take a similar stance\nagainst all third-party YouTube clients, even if they wanted to integrate ads.\nToday Google says that's no longer the case, and it would allow third-party\nYouTube clients provided \"they follow our API Services Terms of Service.\" We\ndon't know of any apps that are actually taking Google up on that offer,\nthough.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### What Happens to the Developers When AI Can Code? | Ars Frontiers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n166\n\nRon Amadeo Ron is the Reviews Editor at Ars Technica, where he specializes in\nAndroid OS and Google products.
