The big email services,\n> gmail, yahoo, outlook and apple, are going to start tightening the\n> thumbscrews (strict SPF, DMARK and DKIM, but also other stuff) on April 1\n> (bad timing, that).\n>\n> I\u2019d vaguely seen that gmail was planning to block much more bulk mail to\n> individuals, but hadn\u2019t really thought about the consequences to normal\n> email forwarding.\n>\n> [...]\n>\n> It\u2019s a good time to audit your email situation, especially if you currently\n> forward mail to large provider controlled domains, or if you have any chains\n> of forwards set up that you\u2019ve forgotten about.\n\nThis has been breaking for a long time. I get lots of bounces because people\nhave set iCloud Mail to forward to an address that rejects the message based\non the headers (which iCloud didn\u2019t rewrite).\n\nPreviously:\n\n  * Today in E-mail Hegemony\n  * Sending E-mail for Sign in With Apple\n\nE-mail Gmail iCloud Sender Policy Framework (SPF) Spam Yahoo Mail\n\n## 1 Comment RSS \u00b7 Twitter \u00b7 Mastodon\n\nJerry\n\nApril 15, 2024 6:06 PM\n\nThis is about ARC signing that few but the big mail operators will be able to\nhandle well (almost impossible these days to run your own mail server for more\nthan special purposes \u2013 I use one to archive mail). What I find more\ntroublesome is that it will get very difficult to *redirect* mail successfully\nand that is sometimes not even supported any longer by some mail operators (at\nleast I know one). One.com that I use for my private mail handles ARC\nforwarding very well. After implementing DMARC myself I reach practically\neveryone one my mailing list if ca 1000 people. Helped a company sending out\nlike 50000 mails to Gmail users and they have around 1% that doesn\u2019t deliver\n(most regular bounces).\n\nHowever, I want myself and others to be able to send out mailing lists from a\nclient like Mail, but Yahoo (a company that long ago should have been closed\ndown), they won\u2019t let you send mass mailings without having a hard-coded\nunsubscribe link in the header and as we no longer use Eudora on Mac this\nmight be the end for sending mass mails from mail clients (I think I will just\nditch people stupid enough to use Yahoo though).\n\n### Leave a Comment\n\n\u2190\n\nBlog Archives Tag Cloud Top Posts\n\nRecently Updated RSS Feed \u00b7 Comments Mastodon \u00b7 Twitter Apple News\n\nSupport this site via Patreon.\n\nTry my Mac apps:\n\nDropDMG EagleFiler SpamSieve ToothFairy\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2000\u20132024 Michael Tsai.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
