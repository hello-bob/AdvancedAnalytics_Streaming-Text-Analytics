The decision\nsent out shockwaves: for the first time, a musician had received the most\nprestigious literary award on the planet. It sparked debate, with many\nquestioning the decision and even sarcastic suggestions that novelists could\naspire to winning a Grammy.\n\nThe controversy fed into much-needed debates on the boundary between poetry\nand song, but the question of what constitutes literature is much broader.\nDoes it mean the same as it did in 1901 when the first Nobel Prize for\nLiterature was awarded?\n\n### High and low culture\n\nThese questions date back far beyond 2016. In the late 1950s, a group of\nprofessors from the University of Birmingham founded a new interdisciplinary\narea of study, called cultural studies, in order to ask new questions: What\nwas the role of TV and other mass media in cultural development? Is there a\njustification for distinguishing high and low culture? What is the\nrelationship between culture and power?\n\nThese questions are all still relevant to current debates around literature.\nOften, the word \u201cliterary\u201d is a status symbol, a seal of approval to\ndistinguish \u201chigh\u201d culture from more vulgar or less valuable \u201clow\u201d forms of\nculture. Comics, for example, were not invited to join the club until\nrecently, thanks in part to a rebranding under the more respectable guise of\n\u201cgraphic novels\u201d.\n\nAccording to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, literature displays \u201cexcellence\nof form or expression and expressing ideas of permanent or universal\ninterest\u201d. It seems that an artist like Bob Dylan can take home the Nobel\nprize thanks to literature\u2019s defining feature of \u201cexcellence of form or\nexpression\u201d, which is not strictly limited to the written word.\n\nBut how do we account for other language-based forms of expression? If\nperformed works such as theatre or songwriting can be considered literature,\nwhere is the limit?\n\n### Word play: text-based video games\n\nAccording to data from video game data consultancy Newzoo, more than 3 billion\npeople play video games worldwide \u2013 almost half of the world\u2019s population. In\nSpain alone, 77% of young people play videogames, making them a massively\nrelevant form of culture. But what does this have to do with \u201cexcellence of\nform or expression\u201d? To answer this question we have to look back several\ndecades.\n\nWhen the first video games were developed in the 1950s, two distinct genres\nemerged: one was action oriented (such as the pioneering 1958 game Tennis for\nTwo), and the other more text based. The original written games, known as\n\u201cinteractive fiction\u201d, were made up exclusively of text, and the player\u2019s job\nwas to read and make decisions that would determine the game\u2019s outcome using a\nkeyboard.\n\nScreenshot of the game Mystery House on Apple II. The colour white was created\nby combining green and purple, producing white in the centre, but bleeding\ninto the other two colours at the edges. Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe inclusion of images in adventure games would not arrive until 1980, when\nMystery House became the first \u201cgraphic adventure\u201d game. These would reach\ntheir heyday in the 1990s: famous examples include the first two Monkey Island\ngames (1990, 1991), Day of the Tentacle (1993), Full Throttle (1995), and Grim\nFandango (1998), though there were many others. Despite technological\nadvances, these games inherited several features from interactive fiction,\nincluding the predominant role of text.\n\nThe experience of playing one of these titles is not so different from that of\na book: reading, pauses, the possibility of backtracking, and so on. The\nplayer spends most of their time in dialogue with various characters in search\nof information, stories, or even banter and jokes that are irrelevant to the\ngame\u2019s progress, much like footnotes or subplots.\n\nSeveral classic adventure games even have direct links to literature: The\nAbbey of Crime (1987) is a Spanish adaptation of Umberto Eco\u2019s The Name of the\nRose, while the legendary insult sword fighting of The Secret of Monkey Island\nwas written by science fiction author Orson Scott Card. In Myst (1993), the\ngameplay itself revolves around two books.\n\n### Literature on the screen: \u201cstory-rich\u201d games\n\nIn more recent years, a new sub-genre of adventure games \u2013 known as \u201cstory-\nrich\u201d games \u2013 has become popular thanks to independent creators and producers.\nIn Papers, Please (2013), a border policeman in a fictional dictatorial regime\ndeals with terrible moral dilemmas on a daily basis. In Firewatch (2016),\nplayers take the role of a forest ranger who investigates a conspiracy by\nwalkie-talkie. In Return of the Obra Dinn (2018), the player must reconstruct\na tragedy on the high seas with the help of an incomplete book and a peculiar\ncompass. In all these cases, gameplay and visuals take a back seat to strong\nnarratives.\n\nScreenshot from the video game Papers, Please. Papers, Please\n\nA quintessential example is The Stanley Parable (2011), where the player takes\nthe role of a worker in a strangely deserted office. They have to explore\nseveral corridors while trying unsuccessfully to interact with their\nsurroundings, accompanied by the voice of an enigmatic narrator. Upon reaching\na room with two open doors, the voiceover states that Stanley \u201centered the\ndoor on his left\u201d.\n\nThe player can choose to follow the instructions or disobey, provoking the\nwrath of the narrator much like in the denouement of Miguel de Unamuno\u2019s 1914\nnovel Fog, where the main character speaks directly to the author.\n\n#### Read More: PlayStation unveils Community Game Help, crowdsources user\ngameplay\n\nEach decision then opens up new paths leading to dozens of possible endings,\nsimilar to a \u201cchoose your own adventure\u201d book. Its fragmentary and disordered\nstory \u2013 as well as its playful spirit \u2013 is reminiscent of Julio Cort\u00e1zar\u2019s\n1963 novel Hopscotch. The experience of playing the game is marked by\npostmodern literary features \u2013 as described by critics like Mikhail Bakhtin or\nLinda Hutcheon \u2013 including metafiction, intertextuality and parody.\n\nOne of its creators \u2013 Davey Wreden, a critical studies graduate \u2013 also created\nThe Beginner\u2019s Guide (2015), a game in which the player moves through levels\nof failed video games to learn more about their mysterious creator. In one,\nthe player\u2019s task consists solely of wandering through a virtual cave reading\nthe countless comments left there by other frustrated players.\n\nScreenshot from the videogame The Beginner\u2019s Guide. Steam/The Beginner\u2019s Guide\n\nIn recent years, the genre of digital or electronic literature has emerged,\nincluding books with QR codes, works that can only be read with virtual\nreality headsets, poetry collections published as apps, and so on. These works\nare fundamentally based on language, begging the question of why video games\ncannot also fit into this category.\n\nThis debate takes on added relevance today, as digital formats are having an\nundeniable impact on our reading habits. Just as today we accept oral cultures\nor popular music as literature, perhaps one day we will do the same with\ninteractive stories like The Stanley Parable. Writing has always tried to\nbreak away from established ideas, and we know that literature is not limited\nto words on paper. Sometimes it pays to disobey the voice in our heads and\nwalk through the door on the right, the one that leads to new, unexplored\npossibilities.\n\n  * Andr\u00e9s Porras Chaves is a Professor of Humanities, IE University\n  * This article first appeared in The Conversation\n\nliterature Nobel Prize The Conversation The Stanley Parable\n\nShare.
