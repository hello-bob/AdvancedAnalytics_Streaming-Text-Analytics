But now, an exciting new upstart is\nchallenging graphene\u2019s title. Meet goldene, a two-dimensional sheet of gold\nthat has its own strange properties.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long ago that graphene was constantly hogging the headlines, thanks\nto it being incredibly strong, thin, flexible, lightweight, and an excellent\nconductor of heat and electricity. And all this from some very humble\nbeginnings \u2013 this 'wonder material' was first created by using some sticky\ntape to peel one-atom-thick layers off a chunk of graphite.\n\nMore Stories\n\nEnvironment\n\n45% of China's urban land is rapidly sinking due to manmade development\n\nMedical\n\nLight-activated propulsion spins bacteria-shredding micromotors\n\nFurther experiments were soon giving the stuff even more amazing properties,\nand it began turning up in electronics, solar panels, displays, clothing,\nhelmets, bullet-proof armor, aircraft, even shoes. But eventually, this\noverachieving material hit the point of oversaturation in the news and the\nmarket \u2013 we\u2019re sick of writing about it, you\u2019re sick of reading about it. Even\nright now, it\u2019s taking up too much space in this story!\n\nThankfully, there might be a new wonder material ready to steal graphene\u2019s\nthunder. Researchers at Link\u00f6ping University in Sweden have successfully\ncreated goldene, a sheet of gold that\u2019s only one atom thick. Like graphene,\nthis changes the material\u2019s properties from its 3D bulk form \u2013 in this case,\ngoldene becomes a semiconductor, switching from regular gold being one of the\nbest conductors around.\n\nThe researchers say that goldene gets its new properties because in its 2D\nform, the atoms get two \u201cfree bonds.\u201d This means it could eventually find use\nas a catalyst for converting carbon dioxide, producing hydrogen or valuable\nchemicals, or purifying water. And of course, electronics could benefit, even\nif it just means less gold is needed to make them.\n\nGoldene didn\u2019t come as easily as graphene, though. Gold atoms have a tendency\nto clump together, so it\u2019s hard to flatten them out into 2D sheets. The\nLink\u00f6ping scientists started by sandwiching thin layers of silicon between\nlayers of titanium and carbide, then coating it in gold. When heated to high\ntemperatures, the thin silicon layer was replaced by gold.\n\nThe tricky step then is to get the goldene out of the sandwich. To do so, the\nresearchers tested a chemical called Murakami\u2019s reagent, used as part of an\nold Japanese blacksmithing technique, which etches away carbon residues. When\nused in low concentrations for up to two months, the goldene is exposed.\nFinally, it\u2019s stabilized with a surfactant.\n\nOf course this is just the beginning for goldene, and the researchers say they\nplan to continue investigating its properties, potential applications, and\nwhether other precious metals could be flattened into two dimensions in\nsimilar ways.\n\nThe research was published in the journal Nature Synthesis.\n\nSource: Link\u00f6ping University\n\n## Tags\n\nMaterialsGoldGraphenenew materialLinkoping UniversitySemiconductors\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * LinkedIn\n\n4 comments\n\nMichael Irving\n\nMichael has always been fascinated by space, technology, dinosaurs, and the\nweirder mysteries of the universe.

People have long\nbeen promising that it (along with carbon nanotubes) would change the world\nand give us all sorts of miracles from space elevator cables to room\ntemperature superconductors yet the world seems decidedly untransformed. I\nsuspect goldene will have its uses but nothing mind blowing. If I could see a\nlist of things it will be used for I\u2019m not sure that \u201cnumber 4 will shock\u201d me.\n\nrabid_doughnuts April 17, 2024 07:28 AM\n\nGold isn't one of the best conductors, it's only useful as a conductor because\nit doesn't corrode\n\nKarmudjun April 17, 2024 10:04 AM\n\nIt is true that Gold is ONE OF the best metallic electrical conductors that it\nis resistant to corrosion. Silver is absolutely the best metallic electrical\nconductor but it tarnishes quickly. Copper is the cheapest & most utilized\nmetallic electrical conductor. But where does carbon or graphene come into the\nequation? Per Leo Rizzi on a nano-scale graphene has a 70% edge over copper\nfor electrical conductivity. Unfortunately the article doesn't discuss the\nanything more than goldene's semiconductor \"potential\". We all know gold\nplated RAM connections are the best for current (mainstream) computer\ntechnology. Not silver, not copper, and so far, not graphene.\n\nAdrian Akau April 17, 2024 08:49 PM\n\nA follow up article would be good.\n\n## GET OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nOver 220,000 people receive our email newsletter.
