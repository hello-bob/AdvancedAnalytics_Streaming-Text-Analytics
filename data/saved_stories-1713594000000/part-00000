Pragmatic drag and drop can be used with any view layer (react,\nsvelte, vue, angular and so on). Pragmatic drag and drop is powering some of\nthe biggest products on the web, including Trello, Jira and Confluence.\n\n## What is this repository?\n\nThis repository is currently one way mirror from our internal monorepo that\ncontains all the code for Pragmatic drag and drop.\n\nThe intention of this repository is to make public our code, but not to accept\ncode contributions (at this stage). In the future we could explore setting up\na two way mirror so that contributions to this repo can also make their way\nback to our monorepo. You are still welcome to raise issues or suggestions on\nthis repository!\n\nAll documentation and npm packages are public and available for use by\neveryone\n\n## Can I use this with my own Design System?\n\nYep! Pragmatic drag and drop as a small core package, and then a range of\noptional packages. Some of the optional packages have dependencies on styling\nsolutions (eg emotion), view libraries (eg react) or on some additional\nAtlassian outputs (eg @atlaskit/tokens). We have separated out optional\npackages that have other dependencies so they can be easily swapped with your\nown pieces that use your own tech stack and visual outputs.\n\n## Can I use my own design language?\n\nYep! We have created some design guidelines which embody how we want to\nachieve drag and drop in our products, and some of those decisions are\nembodied in some optional packages. However, you are free to use whatever\ndesign language you like, including ours!\n\n## What is @atlaskit?\n\nThe Pragmatic drag and drop packages are published under the @atlaskit\nnamespace on npm\n\n    \n    \n    import { draggable } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/element/adapter';\n\n@atlaskit is the npm namespace that we publish all of our public packages on\nfrom inside our internal monorepo. We could look at creating a separate\nnamespace in the future just for Pragmatic drag and drop. If we do that, we'll\nrelease some tooling to help folks automatically switch over.\n\n## Credits\n\nMade with love by:\n\n  * Alex Reardon\n  * Declan Warn\n  * Lewis Healey\n  * Eleni Misthos\n  * Jesse Bauer\n  * Mitch Gavan\n  * Michael Abrahamian\n  * Tim Keir\n  * Greta Ritchard\n  * Many other folks at Atlassian\n  * Logo created by Michelle Holik and Vojta Holik\n\nPragmatic drag and drop stands on the shoulders of giants, including the folks\nwho created the drag and drop specifications, implemented drag and drop in\nbrowsers, and the many drag and drop libraries that came before this.\n\n## About\n\nFast drag and drop for any experience on any tech stack\n\natlassian.design/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop\n\n### Topics\n\ndnd drag-and-drop sortable dropzone\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nView license\n\n### Code of conduct\n\nCode of conduct\n\nActivity\n\nCustom properties\n\n### Stars\n\n4.5k stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n67 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n67 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Languages\n\n  * TypeScript 89.6%\n  * MDX 10.4%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
