For example, a vendor or publisher might need to store a cookie on your device during your first visit on a website, to be able to recognise your device during your next visits (by accessing this cookie each time).\n\nVendors 665\n\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data,\nsuch as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your\ndevice type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for\nexample, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).\n\nExamples:\n\n  * A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.\n  * A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.\n\nVendors 604\n\nInformation about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit,\ncontent you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about\nyou (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and\nother websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or\nimprove a profile about you (that might include possible interests and\npersonal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present\nadvertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by\nthis and other entities.\n\nExamples:\n\n  * If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.\n  * An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.\n\nVendors 491\n\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising\nprofiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or\napps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and\npersonal aspects.\n\nExamples:\n\n  * An online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It wants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on its mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have previously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present you with the corresponding advertisement on the app.\n  * A profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having searched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant advertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.\n\nVendors 486\n\nInformation about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you\nsubmit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with\nother information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or\nother websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or\nimprove a profile about you (which might for example include possible\ninterests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to\npresent content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests,\nsuch as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is\neven easier for you to find content that matches your interests.\n\nExamples:\n\n  * You read several articles on how to build a treehouse on a social media platform. This information might be added to a profile to mark your interest in content related to outdoors as well as do-it-yourself guides (with the objective of allowing the personalisation of content, so that for example you are presented with more blog posts and articles on treehouses and wood cabins in the future).\n  * You have viewed three videos on space exploration across different TV apps. An unrelated news platform with which you have had no contact builds a profile based on that viewing behaviour, marking space exploration as a topic of possible interest for other videos.\n\nVendors 218\n\nContent presented to you on this service can be based on your content\npersonalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other\nservices (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible\ninterests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the\norder in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to\nfind (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.\n\nExamples:\n\n  * You read articles on vegetarian food on a social media platform and then use the cooking app of an unrelated company. The profile built about you on the social media platform will be used to present you vegetarian recipes on the welcome screen of the cooking app.\n  * You have viewed three videos about rowing across different websites. An unrelated video sharing platform will recommend five other videos on rowing that may be of interest to you when you use your TV app, based on a profile built about you when you visited those different websites to watch online videos.\n\nVendors 191\n\nInformation regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you\ninteract with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for\nyou or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For\ninstance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you\nto buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand\nthe relevance of advertising campaigns.\n\nExamples:\n\n  * You have clicked on an advertisement about a \u201cblack Friday\u201d discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.\n  * You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an \u201cinternational appreciation day\u201d discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the \u201cinternational appreciation day\u201d ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.\n\nVendors 703\n\nInformation regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact\nwith it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g.\nreached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance,\nwhether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a\nproduct description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you\nvisit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-\nadvertising) content that is shown to you.\n\nExamples:\n\n  * You have read a blog post about hiking on a mobile app of a publisher and followed a link to a recommended and related post. Your interactions will be recorded as showing that the initial hiking post was useful to you and that it was successful in interesting you in the related post. This will be measured to know whether to produce more posts on hiking in the future and where to place them on the home screen of the mobile app.\n  * You were presented a video on fashion trends, but you and several other users stopped watching after 30 seconds. This information is then used to evaluate the right length of future videos on fashion trends.\n\nVendors 354\n\nReports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user\nprofiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your\ninteractions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising)\ncontent to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which\ntarget audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).\n\nExamples:\n\n  * The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.\n  * An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.\n\nVendors 443\n\nInformation about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with\nads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to\nbuild new products and services based on user interactions, the type of\naudience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or\nimprovement of user profiles and identifiers.\n\nExamples:\n\n  * A technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in mobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are connecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads that are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve their performance.\n  * An advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer device. It collects information regarding the way users interact with this new kind of device to determine whether it can build a new mechanism for displaying advertising on this type of device.\n\nVendors 528\n\nContent presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as\nthe website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type,\nor which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to\nlimit the number of times a video or an article is presented to you).\n\nExamples:\n\n  * A travel magazine has published an article on its website about the new online courses proposed by a language school, to improve travelling experiences abroad. The school\u2019s blog posts are inserted directly at the bottom of the page, and selected on the basis of your non-precise location (for instance, blog posts explaining the course curriculum for different languages than the language of the country you are situated in).\n  * A sports news mobile app has started a new section of articles covering the most recent football games. Each article includes videos hosted by a separate streaming platform showcasing the highlights of each match. If you fast-forward a video, this information may be used to select a shorter video to play next.\n\nVendors 117\n\nSpecial Purposes\n\nYour data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly\nfraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots),\nand ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be\nused to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may\nencounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with\nthem.\n\nExamples:\n\n  * An advertising intermediary delivers ads from various advertisers to its network of partnering websites. It notices a large increase in clicks on ads relating to one advertiser, and uses data regarding the source of the clicks to determine that 80% of the clicks come from bots rather than humans.\n\nCertain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to\nensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to\nfacilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device.\n\nExamples:\n\n  * Clicking on a link in an article might normally send you to another page or part of the article. To achieve this, 1\u00b0) your browser sends a request to a server linked to the website, 2\u00b0) the server answers back (\u201chere is the article you asked for\u201d), using technical information automatically included in the request sent by your device, to properly display the information / images that are part of the article you asked for. Technically, such exchange of information is necessary to deliver the content that appears on your screen.\n\nFeatures\n\nInformation about your activity on this service may be matched and combined\nwith other information relating to you and originating from various sources\n(for instance your activity on a separate online service, your use of a\nloyalty card in-store, or your answers to a survey), in support of the\npurposes explained in this notice.\n\nIn support of the purposes explained in this notice, your device might be\nconsidered as likely linked to other devices that belong to you or your\nhousehold (for instance because you are logged in to the same service on both\nyour phone and your computer, or because you may use the same Internet\nconnection on both devices).\n\nYour device might be distinguished from other devices based on information it\nautomatically sends when accessing the Internet (for instance, the IP address\nof your Internet connection or the type of browser you are using) in support\nof the purposes exposed in this notice.\n\nSpecial FeaturesAccept all | Reject all\n\nWith your acceptance, your precise location (within a radius of less than 500\nmetres) may be used in support of the purposes explained in this notice.\n\nWith your acceptance, certain characteristics specific to your device might be\nrequested and used to distinguish it from other devices (such as the installed\nfonts or plugins, the resolution of your screen) in support of the purposes\nexplained in this notice.\n\nSee the partners we work with below.

You could divide the calls into two\ngroups. Group A was concerned about how quickly AI was going to disrupt a\ncurrent business model. Group B wanted to know if there was an opportunity to\nget a piece of the disruptive action.\n\nCounterintuitively, the venture capitalists and showbiz people were equally\nsplit across the groups. Hollywood producers who were publicly decrying the\nthreat of AI were quietly looking for ways to capitalize on it. Tech startups\nthat thought they had an inside track to disrupting Hollywood were suddenly\nconcerned that they were about to be disrupted by a technical advance they\ndidn't see coming.\n\nThis is the new normal: Even the disruptors are afraid they're about to be\ndisrupted. We're headed for continuous disruption, both for old industries and\nnew ones. But we're also headed for the longest period of economic growth and\nlowest unemployment in history\u2014provided we don't screw it up.\n\nAs AI and robotics accelerate in capabilities and find their way into\nvirtually every corner of our economy, the prospects for human labor have\nnever been better. Because of AI-driven economic growth, demand for human\nworkers will increase; virtually anyone wanting to enter the work force will\nhave opportunities to find meaningful, well-compensated careers. How we look\nat work will change, and the continuous disruption will cause a lot of\nanxiety. But the upside will be social improvements to levels we cannot\ncurrently comprehend. Roles and jobs may shift more frequently, but it will be\neasier to switch and more lucrative to do so.\n\nWhile some of my peers in artificial intelligence have suggested AI could\neliminate the need for work altogether and that we should explore alternative\neconomic models like a universal basic income, I think proposals like that\ndon't take into account the historic effect of automation on the economy and\nhow economic growth increases the demand for labor.\n\nHistory and basic economics both suggest that AI will not make human beings\neconomically irrelevant. AI and robotics will keep growing the economy,\nbecause they continuously increase productivity and efficiency. As the economy\ngrows, there's always going to be a widening gap between demand and capacity.\nDemand for human labor will increase even when AI and robotics are superior\nand more efficient, precisely because there won't be enough AI and robots to\nmeet the growing needs.\n\n## Economic Growth Is Accelerated by Technology\n\nThe goal of commercial AI and robotics is to create efficiencies\u2014that is, to\ndo something more inexpensively than prior methods, whether by people or\nmachines. You use an industrial robot to weld a car because a human welder\nwould take too long and wouldn't have near the precision. You use ChatGPT to\nhelp write a grant proposal because it saves you time and means you don't have\nto pay someone else to help write it.\n\nWith an increase in efficiency, you can either lower prices or not lower\nprices and buy a private island. If you don't lower prices, you run the risk\nof competition from someone who sees their own path to a private island\nthrough your profits. As Amazon's Jeff Bezos once said, \"Your margin is my\nopportunity.\" In a free market, you usually don't get to reap high margins\nforever. Eventually, someone else uses price to compete.\n\nAlong with this competition comes growth, which also drives innovation. The\ncomputer add-on boards used for the Halo and Call of Duty games turned out to\nbe really useful for the kind of computations it takes to produce an AI like\nChatGPT. Thanks to that quirk of mathematics, Nvidia was able to add $2\ntrillion to its market cap over the last five years, and we were saved from\nthe drudgery of writing lengthy emails and other repetitive text tasks. Along\nwith that market cap came huge profits. Nvidia is now using those profits to\nfund research into everything from faster microchips to robotics. Other large\ncompanies, such as Microsoft and Google, are also pouring profits into new\nstartups focusing on AI, health, and robotics. All of this causes economic\ngrowth and cheaper and/or better goods.\n\nEven with continuous technological disruption displacing and destroying other\nindustries, the United States gross domestic product has more than doubled\nover the last 20 years, from $11 trillion to $27 trillion. If you compare the\nU.S. to the slightly more technophobic European Union, you can make the case\nthat Europe's limits to technologic growth\u2014through legislation and through\nrisk-averse investment strategies\u2014is one of the factors causing slower\neconomic growth (Europe's growth rate was 45.61 percent compared with 108.2\npercent in the U.S.).\n\nThis was the problem India created for itself after achieving independence in\n1948. The government enacted so many laws to protect jobs (the \"License Raj\")\nthat it stalled the country's economic development for decades, nearly lost\nmillions to famine, and got eclipsed by the Chinese.\n\nIf technology is a driving force for economic growth, mixing in\nsuperintelligent AI means accelerated growth. Even if there are periods of\ntechnological stagnation\u2014which is doubtful\u2014applying current AI automation\nmethods will improve efficiencies across industries. If H&R Block could\nreplace 90 percent of its seasonal employees with AI, it would see its profits\nskyrocket, given that labor is its biggest expense. Those profits would be\nreallocated elsewhere, that would increase the potential for even more\neconomic growth, and that would in turn create better opportunities for the\naccountants.\n\nWhat about physical labor? Outsourcing jobs overseas is just the final step\nbefore they're outsourced out of existence by robotics. If you don't have to\nbuild your product on the other side of the planet, you have efficiency in\nboth cost and time to market. The less time goods spend in shipping containers\ncrossing the Pacific, the more available capital you have. More capital means\nmore growth.\n\nIf the last several hundred years of economic history are any indication, AI\nand robotics are going to increase the total surface area of the economy\nfaster than we can comprehend. The more intense the disruption\u2014like the\nassembly line, electrical power, or the internet\u2014the greater the gains.\nThere's not much evidence to expect anything other than huge economic growth\nif we continue to improve efficiency and see an acceleration as AI systems and\nrobotics keep improving.\n\nBut what about the workers? A fast-growing economy alone doesn't guarantee\nthat every labor sector will benefit\u2014but other factors come into play that\nmight.\n\nAn image generated using the prompt, \"Illustration of AI as a doctor, teacher,\npoet, scientist, warlord, actor, journalist, artist, and coder.\"\n(Illustration: Joanna Andreasson/DALL-E4)\n\n## New Jobs at a Scale We Can't Predict\n\nWhile innovation may eliminate the need for certain kinds of labor in one\nsector of the economy (farm equipment reduced the demand for farmworkers) it\nusually comes with an increase in competition for labor in other areas\n(increased agricultural productivity helped drive the growth of\nindustrialization and the demand for factory workers). This allows us to\nswitch from lower-paying jobs to higher-paying ones. Higher-paying jobs\ngenerally mean ones where innovation either leverages your physical capability\n(moving from the shovel to a bulldozer) or amplifies your cognitive output\n(going from paper ledgers to electronic spreadsheets).\n\nPredicting how this will happen is hard, because we are really bad at\nimagining the future. To understand where we are headed, we have to get out of\nthe mindset that the future is just the present with robots and weird clothes.\n\nThe first photograph of a person is believed to have been taken in 1838.\nImagine trying to explain to a portrait artist at that time that photography\nnot only did not mean the death of his occupation, but that this invention\nwould lead to an entirely new medium, motion pictures, where an artist like\nJames Cameron would work with a crew of thousands to shoot Avatar (2009), a\nfilm that would cost (in unadjusted dollars) more to produce than the entire\n1838 U.S. military budget and would gross more than the entire gross national\nproduct of that period. The number of people who worked directly on Avengers:\nEndgame (4,308) was more than half the size of the United States Army in 1838\n(7,958).\n\nThe future is bigger than we can imagine.\n\nChange is equally hard to comprehend. Two centuries ago, 80 percent of the\nU.S. population worked on farms. If you told one of those farmers that in 2024\nbarely 1 percent of the population would work on farms, he'd have a difficult\ntime imagining what the other 79 percent of the population would do with their\ntime. If you then tried to explain what an average income could purchase in\nthe way of a Netflix subscription, airplane transportation, and a car, he'd\nthink you were insane. The same principle applies to imagining life 50 years\nfrom now.\n\nAmazon was already a public company in 1998, when the economist and future\nNobel Prize winner Paul Krugman predicted: \"By 2005 or so, it will become\nclear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the\nfax machine.\" Amazon is now the second-largest employer in the United States,\nand its cloud service powers just about everything we now do online. Although\nwe might be able to predict the possibility of disruption, accurately gauging\nthe transformation it brings is still impossible.\n\nWhile technology causes disruption across industries and shrinks many of them,\nit also expands the labor force in unexpected ways. A quarter-century ago, it\nmay have seemed inconceivable that more people would work for a startup like\nGoogle than General Motors. Alphabet, Google's parent company, now has 182,502\nemployees; GM has 163,000. More people work for Apple (161,000) than\nMcDonald's (150,000). Meta\u2014Facebook's parent company\u2014has more employees than\nABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox combined (67,000 vs. 66,000).\n\nAnd they aren't all programmers. At Microsoft, fewer than half the employees\nare software engineers. For a conglomerate like Amazon, the percentage is even\nless. Amazon has tens of thousands of people delivering packages, and Apple\nhas human staff working in physical stores\u2014despite the fact the company also\nsells online. While Amazon might try to shrink its human labor force via\nrobotics, Apple is increasing it. When Apple launched retail stores, experts\ntold them this was ill-advised, that shopping was all moving online. But Apple\nunderstood that some decisions required a physical presence and a human touch.\nIf you want to talk to a Google or Meta employee, good luck. If you want to\ntalk to someone from Apple, just go to your nearest shopping mall. Apple bet\non technological innovations and human beings, and it now has greater net\nprofit last year than Meta and Google combined ($100 billion).\n\nThe demand is so large for technically skilled people that companies are\nconstantly pushing for an increase in the number of H-1B visas awarded each\nyear. At any given time, the tech industry has approximately 100,000 unfilled\njobs. Outside of bubbles and recessions, people laid off from tech companies\ngenerally find new jobs very quickly.\n\nEconomic growth also spurs new demand for traditional industries, such as\nconstruction. A million robots would barely make a dent upgrading the United\nStates infrastructure, let alone globally. We're going to need more human\nforemen and site supervisors than we're capable of producing.\n\nIf we accept that the future economy is going to be much bigger than today's\nand that entirely new categories of jobs will be created\u2014even in companies\nworking hard to replace us with robots\u2014we still have to accept the argument\nthat many current occupations will go away. The skills you and I currently\npossess may become obsolete. Yet there are reasons to believe people at all\nstages of their career paths will have an easier and more rewarding experience\nswitching jobs than ever before.\n\n## The Retraining Myth\n\nWhen President Joe Biden said that \"Anybody who can throw coal into a furnace\ncan learn how to program,\" he might have been making a big assumption about\nwhat kind of labor the future will need and the types of jobs we will want.\nWhen we talk about job retraining, we should think about it in the context of\nan assembly-line worker learning how to do HVAC repair or a cashier learning\nhow to do customer service for a car company.\n\nResearch on job retraining looks pretty bleak at first glance. The U.S.\ngovernment spends about $20 billion a year on job programs and has very little\ndata to support how effective that is. When you dig deeper into the data, you\nfind that there's very little correlation between dollars spent on these\nprograms and wage increases among the people who use them. Because of this,\nmost labor economists argue that job retraining doesn't work.\n\nYet people learn new skills and switch careers all the time. Switching roles\nwithin a company requires retraining, and similar roles at different companies\nmay be very different in practice. Retraining in practice works extremely\nwell. What people really mean when they say \"job retraining doesn't work\" is\nthat it's not that effective when the town factory closes and a government\nprogram materializes to help the unemployed workers find new jobs.\n\nWhen you look into job retraining data, it becomes apparent that there's not a\nsingle catchall solution that works in every situation for every person. The\nmost effective efforts are ones that find close matches for skills by\nproviding consultation and resources, offer hands-on apprenticeship training\nso people can adapt on the job, and ease people into new skills while they're\nstill employed. Artificial intelligence might end up playing a role here too:\nA study I commissioned while at Open-AI suggested that AI-assisted education\ncan reduce the fear of embarrassment in learning new skills. ChatGPT will\nnever judge you, no matter how dumb the question.\n\nThose people who want well-paying careers and are willing to learn the skills\nwill find jobs. By and large, even a 59-year-old won't have trouble finding\nmeaningful work.\n\nIf that still sounds like a stretch, consider this: We have solid data that in\na high-growth economy, job retraining can pull differently skilled and\npreviously unemployable people into the work force in record numbers. The\nlowest unemployment rate in U.S. history was 0.8 percent in October 1944. That\nbasically meant everyone who wanted a job and wasn't living in a shack\nsurrounded by 100 miles of desert had a job. This included millions of women\nwho didn't previously have opportunities to work outside the home. They were\nput into factories and assembly lines to fill the gap left by soldiers sent\noverseas and helped expand our production to new levels that didn't exist\nbefore.\n\nWas World War II an outlier? Yes: It was a situation where there was so much\ndemand for labor that we were pulling every adult we could into the work\nforce. The demand in an AI-driven economy will be just as great, if not\ngreater.\n\nBut won't we just use AI and robots to fill all those gaps? The short answer:\nno. The demand for labor and knowledge work will always be greater than the\nsupply.\n\n## Never Enough Computers and Robots\n\nDavid Ricardo, the classical economist, explained more than 200 years ago why\nwe shouldn't fear robots taking over.\n\nNo, those weren't his precise words. But his theory of comparative advantage\nexplained that even when you're able to produce something at extreme\nefficiency, it can make mathematical sense to trade with less-efficient\nproducers. He used the example of why England should buy port wine from\nPortugal even though they could make it more cheaply domestically. If England\nmade more profit on producing textiles, it made the most economic sense to\ndedicate its resources to textiles and use the surpluses to slightly overpay\nfor wine from another country. It's basic math, yet government economists will\nhuddle around a conference room table arguing that you need to keep all\nproduction domestic while ordering out for a pizza instead of making it\nthemselves\u2014even if one of them happens to be a fantastic cook.\n\nWhen OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November 2022, we had no idea what to expect.\nI remember sitting in on a meeting debating the impact this \"low-key research\npreview\" would have. We came to the conclusion that it would be minor. We were\nwrong: ChatGPT became an instant hit, and it soon had more than 100,000,000\nusers. It was the fastest adoption of an application by a startup in history.\nThis was great, except for one problem: We couldn't meet the demand.\n\nThere weren't enough computers on the planet to handle all of the users\nwanting access to ChatGPT. OpenAI had to use its supercomputer clusters\nintended to train newer AI systems to help support the need for compute. As\nGoogle and other companies realized the market potential for AI assistants\nlike ChatGPT, they began to ramp up their efforts and increased the demand for\ncompute even more. This is why Nvidia added $2 trillion to its market cap.\nPeople quickly realized this demand wasn't going to slow down. It was going to\naccelerate.\n\nThe goal of commercial AI is to efficiently replace cognitive tasks done in\nthe workplace, from handling a customer service complaint to designing your\nfall product line. This means replacing neurons with transistors. The paradox\nis that once you maximize the efficiency of something like producing farming\nequipment, you end up creating new economic opportunities, because of the\nsurpluses. Overall demand increases, not decreases. Even with robots building\nrobots and AI creating new business opportunities, we'll always be short of\nhands and minds. Even lesser-skilled human talent will be in demand. Just like\nwe needed everyone to participate in the wartime economy, we didn't reach\nnear\u2013zero unemployment because it was a nice thing to do; because of\ncomparative advantage, it made the most economic sense.\n\nWhen the Manhattan Project ran out of mathematicians, the government recruited\nfrom the clerical staff to do computations. The same happened at Bletchley\nPark with code breaking, and again two decades later at NASA. While today's\ncomputers handle advanced computations so fast that they can solve a problem\nbefore you can explain it to a person, we now cram mathematicians into rooms\nwith whiteboards and have them think up new things for the computers to do\nguided by our needs. AI won't change that. Companies are actively building\nsystems to function as AI researchers. They'll eventually be smarter than the\npeople who made them\u2014yet that will lead to demand for even more human AI\nresearchers.\n\nEven people in AI have trouble understanding this argument. They can make\npersuasive cases why AI and robotics will supersede human capabilities in just\nabout every way, but they give blank looks to arguments about why the demand\nfor intelligence and labor will always be greater than the supply. They can\nimagine AI replacing our way of doing things, but they have trouble\nunderstanding how it will grow demand at such a rate we'll still need dumb,\nclumsy people. The publicity around high-end computer shortages and the\nrealization that we can't meet present demand, let alone future demand, should\nhopefully make people consider this in practical economic considerations.\n\nConversations about how to shape a future economy with concepts like the\nuniversal basic income are worth having\u2014but they're trying to solve a problem\nthat probably won't exist in the way that some people foresee. Human beings\nwill be a vital part of economic development well into the future.\n\nNobody in 1838 saw motion pictures or the likes of James Cameron coming, let\nalone the concept of a \"video game.\" Our near future is just as difficult to\npredict. But one thing seems certain: You might not need a job in 2074, but\nthere will be one if you want it.\n\n### Latest\n\n#### Coddled Kids Become Depressed, Anti-Social College Students\n\nLenore Skenazy | 4.29.2024 5:01 PM\n\n#### FDA Once Again Stands Athwart Biomedical Innovation, Yelling 'Stop!'\n\nRonald Bailey | 4.29.2024 4:15 PM\n\n#### Don't Fall For RFK Jr.'s Home Loan Scheme\n\nEzra Wyrick | 4.29.2024 4:00 PM\n\n#### China Is Doubling Down on Electric Vehicle Subsidies\n\nJoe Lancaster | 4.29.2024 3:40 PM\n\n#### Bipartisan Legislation Would Let the Government Create Speech-Chilling\n'Antisemitism Monitors'\n\nEmma Camp | 4.29.2024 2:26 PM\n\n  * About\n  * Browse Topics\n  * Events\n  * Staff\n  * Jobs\n  * Donate\n  * Advertise\n  * Subscribe\n  * Contact\n  * Media\n  * Shop\n  * Amazon\n\nReason Facebook@reason on XReason InstagramReason TikTokReason YoutubeApple\nPodcastsReason on FlipboardReason RSS\n\n\u00a9 2024 Reason Foundation | Accessibility | Privacy Policy | Terms Of Use\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of\nService apply.\n\nNotifications\n\n", "frontpage": true}
