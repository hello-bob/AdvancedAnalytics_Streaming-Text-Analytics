If you're struggling to decide the foods worth buying organic,\nbest-selling author Michael Pollan has some suggestions for the ones worth\nsplurging on to avoid harmful chemicals.\n\nIn today's big story, we're looking at a critical tech review that caused a\nbit of a stir on social media.\n\nWhat's on deck:\n\n  * Markets: Goldman Sachs quiets the haters with a monster earnings report.\n\n  * Tech: Leaked docs show one of Prime Video's biggest issues, forcing customers to abandon shows.\n\n  * Business: The best bet in business these days?

For Now\"\n\nMarques Brownlee, the YouTuber better known as MKBHD, didn't mince words with\nthe title of his review of Humane's AI Pin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a 25-minute video, Brownlee details all the issues he encountered using the\nAI device. (Spoiler alert: There were a lot.)\n\nBrownlee's review aligns with other criticisms of the device. But not all of\nthose came from someone with as much sway. His YouTube channel has more than\n18 million subscribers.\n\nOne user on X pointed that out, calling the review \"almost unethical\" for\n\"potentially killing someone else's nascent project\" in a post reposted over\n2,000 times.\n\nMost of the internet disagreed, and a Humane exec even thanked Brownlee on X\nfor the \"fair and valid critiques.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it highlights the power of Brownlee's reviews. Earlier this year, a\nnegative video of Fisker's Ocean SUV by Brownlee also made waves on social\nmedia.\n\nMario Tama/Getty Images; Chelsea Jia Feng/BI\n\nCritical reviews in the age of innovation raise some interesting questions.\n\nTo be clear, there was nothing wrong with Brownlee's review. Humane's AI Pin\ncosts $700. Watering down his review to ease the blow would be a disservice to\nthe millions of fans relying on his perspective before making such a\nsignificant purchase.\n\nToo often, companies view potential customers as an extension of their\nresearch and development. They are happy to sell a product that is still a\nwork in progress on the promise they'll fix it on the fly. (\"Updates are\ncoming!\")\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in a world of instant gratification, it can be hard to appreciate that\ninnovation takes time.\n\nEven Apple can run into this conundrum. Take the Apple Vision Pro. Reviewers\nare impressed with the technology behind the much-anticipated gadget \u2014 but are\nstill struggling to figure out what they can do with it. Maybe, over time,\nthat will get sorted out.\n\nIt's also worth remembering how cool tech can be, as Business Insider's Peter\nKafka wrote following a bunch of trips in Waymo's software-powered taxis in\nSan Francisco. Sure, robotaxis have their issues, Peter said, but they also\nelicit that \"golly-gee-can-you-believe-it\" sense.\n\nAs for Humane, America loves a comeback story. Just look at \"Cyberpunk 2077.\"\nThe highly anticipated video game had a disastrous launch in 2020, but\nredeemed itself three years later, ultimately winning a major award.\n\nStill, Humane shouldn't get a pass for releasing a product that didn't seem\nready for primetime, according to the reviews.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd its issue could be bigger than glitchy tech. Humane's broader thesis about\nreducing screen time might not be as applicable. As BI's Katie Notopolous put\nit: \"I love staring at my iPhone.\"\n\n## 3 things in markets\n\nREUTERS/Danny Moloshok\n\n1\\. Goldman finally strikes gold. After a rough stretch, the vaunted\ninvestment bank crushed earnings expectations, sending its stock soaring. A\nbig tailwind, according to CEO David Solomon, is AI spawning \"enormous\nopportunities\" for the bank.\n\n2\\. Buy the dip, Wedbush says. Last week's drop among tech stocks shouldn't\nscare away investors, according to Wedbush. A strong earnings report, buoyed\nby the ongoing AI craze, should keep them soaring, strategists said. But\nJPMorgan doesn't see it that way, saying prices are already stretched.\n\n3\\. China's economy beat analysts' expectations. The country's GDP grew 5.3%\nin the first quarter of 2024, according to data published by the National\nBureau of Statistics on Tuesday. It's a welcome return to form for the world's\nsecond-largest economy, although below-par new home and retail sales remain a\ncause for concern.\n\n## 3 things in tech\n\nKevin Winter/Getty\n\n1\\. Amazon Prime Video viewers are giving up on its shows. Leaked documents\nshow viewers are fed up with the streamer's error-ridden catalog system, which\noften has incomplete titles and missing episodes. In 2021, 60% of all content-\nrelated complaints were about Prime Video's catalog.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2\\. Eric Newcomer is bringing his Cerebral Valley AI Summit to New York. The\nconference, originally held in San Francisco, is famous for producing one of\nthe largest generative AI acquisitions ever. Now, it's coming to New York in\nJune.\n\n3\\. OpenAI is plotting an expansion to NYC. Two people familiar with the plans\ntold BI that the ChatGPT developer is looking to open a New York office next\nyear. That would be the company's fifth office, alongside its current\nheadquarters in San Francisco, a just-opened site in Tokyo, and spots in\nLondon and Dublin.\n\n## 3 things in business\n\niStock; Rebecca Zisser/BI\n\n1\\. America's young men are spending their money like never before. From\nsports betting to meme coins, young men are more willing than ever to blow\nmoney in the hopes of making a fortune.\n\n2\\. Investors are getting into women's sports. With women like Caitlin Clark\ndominating March Madness headlines, investors see a big opportunity. BI\ncompiled a list of 13 investors and fund managers pouring money into the next\nbig thing in sports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3\\. Bad news for Live Nation.
