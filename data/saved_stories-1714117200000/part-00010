Now, scientists in Australia have\nmade a device that goes the other way: it consumes carbon dioxide to generate\nelectricity.\n\nThe carbon-negative power generator, reported in the journal Nature\nCommunications, is only a small proof-of-concept laboratory-scale device right\nnow. But it could pave the way towards a new industrial-scale carbon capture\nmethod, its developers say.\n\nAs the world hurtles towards a future where climate change could cause\nunlivable conditions for millions, carbon capture will play a key role in\ndecarbonizing the energy sector, alongside renewable energy development. But\ncurrent carbon capture technologies, which rely on special chemicals to draw\ncarbon dioxide out of smokestack emissions and the air, remain costly and\nenergy-intensive.\n\nProfessor of chemical engineering Xiwang Zhang and colleagues at the\nUniversity of Queensland developed a device that produce electricity from the\nflow of charges. They start with microscopic flakes of an atoms-thick material\ncalled boron nitride, and coat them with a polymer called polyethyleneimine.\n\nRecommended Reading:\n\nChemists use bacteria to convert CO2 in the air into bioplastic\n\nThe team embedded these flakes in a hydrogel that is made of 90 percent water.\nThen they cut the gel into 4-centimetre discs tested it in a sealed box pumped\nfull of carbon dioxide. The coated flakes soak carbon dioxide, and produce\npositively and negatively charged particles. The positive ions are big and\nstay confined in the gel, while the much small negative ions move through the\nhydrogel channels, producing electricity.\n\n\u201cAt present we can harvest around one per cent of the total energy carried\nintrinsically by carbon dioxide but like other technologies, we will now work\non improving efficiency and reducing cost,\u201d said Zhuyuan Wang, a postdoctoral\nresearcher and lead author of the paper in a press release.\n\nThe researchers say there could be two uses for the device with scale up. It\ncould be used as a portable electricity generator to power small electronics.\nA much larger-scale application would be to integrate the technology at an\nindustrial carbon capture plant to produce electricity.\n\nSource: Zhuyuan Wang et al.
