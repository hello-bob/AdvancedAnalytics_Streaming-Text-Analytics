But what are the responsibilities\nand liabilities of the Free Software developers? A potential threat to Free\nSoftware developers looms in the form of an ongoing lawsuit in the UK\ninvolving Bitcoin and its core developers.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is a cryptocurrency created in 2009 that operates under the MIT\nFree Software licence. After its creator disappeared, a group of software\ndevelopers continued to develop Bitcoin independently. Currently, Dr. Craig\nWright, who claimed to be the creator of Bitcoin, is suing the Bitcoin\ndevelopers in the UK courts through his company, Tulip Trading Limited\n(Tulip). This company claims to have lost \u00a33 billion worth of bitcoin due to a\nhack that compromised the private keys, resulting in the loss of access to the\nfunds. In this lawsuit Tulip is demanding that the Bitcoin developers provide\naccess to the lost Bitcoin, arguing that the developers have a legal\nobligation to provide access or offer equitable compensation or damages.\n\nAs such, this legal case is currently drawing attention to the issue of Free\nSoftware developers' liability, in particular the extent to which they are\nresponsible to their users.\n\n### UK High Court\u2019s opinion: Developers have no legal duties or a duty of care\nin this case, but they do have certain duties in some specific situations.\n\nThe High Court considered whether software developers and controllers of\ndigital asset networks bear legal obligations to cryptocurrency holders who\nrely on their software. The court ruled in favour of the developers, stating\nthat as a \"fluctuating body of individuals\", the developers could not\nrealistically maintain ongoing obligations. The court rejected the notion that\ndevelopers should be compelled to provide software updates upon the request of\ndigital asset owners, emphasising the absence of any explicit commitment or\nassurance by the developers. Regarding the alleged tortious duties, the Court\ndetermined that the developers did not owe Tulip a duty of care, highlighting\nthat Tulip's loss was solely economic.\n\n> A duty of care is a legal responsibility imposed on an individual that\n> requires them to follow a level of reasonable care when conducting any acts\n> that could endanger others.\n\nHowever, the court recognized that, in certain cases, software developers have\nspecific duties. For instance, developers must exercise caution to avoid\nharming users' interests and may have an obligation to remedy bugs or faults\nin the system.\n\nThe court also acknowledged that the disclaimer in the MIT license, broadly\ndisclaims liability for software issues. However, the court did not confirm\nwhether this disclaimer absolved BTC Network developers of responsibility for\nits operation. This is because:\n\n  * the MIT disclaimer has never been litigated, and the court is free to decide and set precedent.\n  * such disclaimers are not easily found when using software.\n\n### UK Court of Appeal\u2019s opinion: Arguable that developers owe some fiduciary\nlegal duties\n\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeal (the second highest court in the UK) overturned\nthe High Court's decision, concluding that it was at least arguable that the\ndevelopers owe fiduciary legal duties to cryptocurrency owners. The court\nnoted the exclusive control of the Bitcoin software code by a small group of\ndevelopers and their decision-making role on behalf of all Bitcoin owners,\nresembling fiduciary responsibilities. The court also noted that only a\nhandful of developers have exclusive access to the Bitcoin software code on\nGitHub. For example, if a Bitcoin owner notices a bug, he or she is unable to\nfix it because only the developers with access can do so, and they have to\nagree to do so. In the eyes of the court, this is a clear exercise of the de\nfacto power of the developers. The court completely missed the point that no\none can prevent others from applying a fix to the code - that is part of the\nfundamental freedom that comes with Free Software: if the developers of a\nparticular repository refuse to apply needed fixes, the community can fork the\nproject and bypass those developers.\n\nFurthermore, code is speech. Freedom of expression includes expression in the\nlanguage of computer code as well. Imposing disproportionate duties on Free\nSoftware developers forces them to change their code, and therefore infringes\non their freedom of expression. The court also observed that the developers\nhave a positive duty to fix bugs and code errors and a negative duty to\nrefrain from acting in their own self-interest.\n\nIn summary, Tulip's case raises significant legal questions, and according to\nthe latest developments, Tulip must prove ownership of the alleged stolen\nbitcoins in a preliminary trial.\n\n### Chilling effect on Free Software development?\n\nCommon law in the UK (and other countries) is developed through court\ndecisions and precedents. When a court makes a decision in a case, it\nestablishes a legal precedent that serves as a guide for future cases with\nsimilar circumstances. Lower courts generally have to follow the precedents\nset by the higher courts. Courts in common law countries tend to also borrow\nconcepts and precedents from other countries if there is no local precedent\navailable. The law and legal scholarship around Free Software developers\u2019\nduties is underdeveloped and almost non-existent. If Tulip succeeds in their\ncase, it may set an international legal precedent, opening the floodgates to\nlitigation. This means that any user of Free Software could potentially sue\ndevelopers for alleged breaches of duty.\n\n> A fiduciary duty, as claimed by Tulip, refers to the legal duty of a person\n> or entity to act in the best interests of another party, typically referred\n> to as the beneficiary or principal. This duty is characterized by trust,\n> confidence, and reliance on the fiduciary to act ethically and responsibly\n> on behalf of the beneficiary. Fiduciary duties exist in only very specific\n> relationships, like those of trustees, solicitors, agents, partners, and\n> company directors. Attaching these duties to Free Software developers is\n> unprecedented and disproportionate.\n\nFree Software production, a catalyst for technological innovation, relies on\nvoluntary contributions. Imposing fiduciary duties (or any disproportionate\nduties) on developers could deter them from participating in Free Software\nprojects, fearing legal repercussions. This could lead to a chilling effect,\nwhere developers opt for more restrictive licensing, or refrain from sharing\ntheir code altogether, or release the software only in jurisdictions where\nthere are no duties out of fear of litigation. The results of such an effect\nwould be disastrous; stifling innovation and potentially halting the progress\nof specific Free Software endeavours.\n\nIn essence, if the court rules in favour of Tulip, it can have far-reaching\nconsequences that can be detrimental to the Free Software developers in the\nfollowing ways:\n\n  1. Courts may impose an active duty on Free Software developers to fix what the courts deem to be problematic issues.\n  2. In future courts may impose an active duty on Free Software developers to not cause any bugs that impact users. This can potentially expose the developers to litigation for just letting through a bug or failing to spot a bug.\n  3. Courts may also impose obligations on Free Software developers that require them to compromise the cryptographic integrity guarantees of the software. This could involve mandates to weaken encryption algorithms or provide backdoor access, directly undermining the security measures designed to protect user privacy and data confidentiality. Such orders would not only compromise the effectiveness of encryption software but also the tools such as secure file deletion or data recovery.\n\nFree Software development thrives on the collaborative efforts of developers\nworldwide, continually evolving. The developers\u2019 autonomy inherent in Free\nSoftware must not be jeopardized by the fear of unjust litigation. FSFE\nremains vigilant in safeguarding against threats to developer autonomy that\ncould stifle innovation. In the light of these concerns, we call upon the\ndevelopers to persist in their invaluable work without fear.\n\nDiscuss this\n\n## Tags\n\n  * Legal\n  * United Kingdom\n  * Licensing\n\n### Press\n\n  * Press Room\n  * Latest News\n  * Free Software Basics\n\nBecome a supporter\n\n### About the FSFE\n\nFree Software Foundation Europe is a charity that empowers users to control\ntechnology.\n\nSoftware is deeply involved in all aspects of our lives.
