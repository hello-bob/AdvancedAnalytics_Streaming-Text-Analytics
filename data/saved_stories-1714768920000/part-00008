Defense lawyers\nhave said he lied under oath about his expertise and made false claims about\nwhen and where the technology has been used.\n\nSummit County Common Pleas Court in Akron, Ohio.Google Maps\n\nMay 3, 2024, 1:00 PM UTC\n\nBy Tim Stelloh\n\nLaw enforcement agencies and prosecutors from Colorado to New York have turned\nto a little-known artificial intelligence tool in recent years to help\ninvestigate, charge and convict suspects accused of murder and other serious\ncrimes.\n\nBut as the software, called Cybercheck, has spread, defense lawyers have\nquestioned its accuracy and reliability. Its methodology is opaque, they\u2019ve\nsaid, and it hasn\u2019t been independently vetted.\n\nThe company behind the software has said the technology relies on machine\nlearning to scour vast swaths of the web and gather \u201copen source intelligence\u201d\n\u2014 social media profiles, email addresses and other publicly available\ninformation \u2014 to help identify potential suspects\u2019 physical locations and\nother details in homicides and human trafficking crimes, cold cases and\nmanhunts.\n\nThe tool\u2019s creator, Adam Mosher, has said that Cybercheck\u2019s accuracy tops 90%\nand that it performs automated research that would take humans hundreds of\nhours to complete. By last year, the software had been used in nearly 8,000\ncases spanning 40 states and nearly 300 agencies, according to a court\ndecision that cited prosecutors in a New York case that relied on the tool.\n\nIn the New York case, a judge barred authorities from introducing Cybercheck\nevidence last year after having found that prosecutors hadn\u2019t shown that it\nwas reliable or well-accepted, the decision shows. In another ruling last\nyear, an Ohio judge blocked a Cybercheck analysis when Mosher refused to\ndisclose the software\u2019s methodology.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re being asked to trust a company to present evidence that could\neventually put people in prison,\u201d said William Budington, a senior staff\ntechnologist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil liberties group.\n\u201cThat goes against the right to due process.\u201d\n\nIn a motion filed last month in a fatal robbery in Akron, Ohio, defense\nlawyers representing two defendants charged with murder demanded that Mosher\nprovide the software\u2019s proprietary code and algorithm.\n\nIn the April 10 filing, the lawyers also made an alarming series of\nallegations: Mosher lied under oath about his expertise and made false claims\nabout when and where the technology has been used.\n\nDonald Malarcik, one of the defense lawyers who filed the motion, said in an\nemail that it was \u201cshocking\u201d that prosecutors continued to rely on Mosher as\nan expert.\n\nMosher didn\u2019t respond to a detailed list of questions about Malarcik\u2019s\ncomments or the filing. An executive for the Canadian company that makes\nCybercheck, Global Intelligence Inc., cited ongoing court matters and said it\nwouldn\u2019t comment.\n\nMosher has said he wouldn\u2019t provide Cybercheck\u2019s software to defense experts\nbecause it is proprietary, according to an appeals filing in the Ohio homicide\ncase that was ruled on last year.\n\nA spokesman for the Akron Police Department, which investigated the fatal\nrobbery, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for the Summit\nCounty Prosecutor\u2019s Office, which is handling the case, wouldn\u2019t comment,\nciting pending litigation.\n\nAt a hearing last year, the prosecutor addressed some of the allegations in\nthe filing and said Mosher was \u201cgreat at software, great at open source\nintelligence, a work in progress on the law,\u201d according to a transcript of the\nSeptember hearing.\n\nThe prosecutor, Brian Stano, said his office had no intention of opening an\ninvestigation into Mosher, the transcript shows.\n\n\u201cI believe this is more of a lost-in-translation issue as opposed to some sort\nof impropriety,\u201d he said.\n\n## \u2018Circumstantial\u2019 evidence\n\nWhen law enforcement agencies request assistance from Cybercheck, the software\nsearches parts of the web that aren\u2019t indexed by search engines, as well as\nthe surface web. Those findings are compiled in a report and provided to law\nenforcement agencies.\n\nSeveral contracts and proposals reviewed by NBC News show officials from\nWashington state to Pennsylvania considering or agreeing to pay Global\nIntelligence $11,000 to $35,000 for Cybercheck. The company secured a $25,000\nagreement with Akron beginning in April 2022 that included 50 cases and 40\nhours of \u201creal time intelligence,\u201d according to a copy of the contract\nMalarcik obtained through a public records request and shared with NBC News.\n\nThe Akron police spokesman didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment about the\nagreement.\n\nIn the fatal robbery, two men were arrested in July 2021 in connection with\nthe alleged crime nine months earlier, authorities said in a news release. The\nmen, Deshawn Coleman and Eric Farrey Jr., were later indicted on charges of\naggravated murder, aggravated robbery and other crimes.\n\nA ballistics analysis on a gun found at Coleman\u2019s home linked him to shell\ncasings at the scene of the homicide, Malarcik said. A car registered to\nFarrey was captured on camera near the scene, he said. Both men have pleaded\nnot guilty, and Malarcik described that evidence as \u201centirely circumstantial.\u201d\n\nIn December 2022, Malarcik said in an interview, Cybercheck produced a report\nplacing both men at the scene. The report was created after the software\nsearched the web for 21 days in an automated process that sifted through 1.1\npetabytes of information \u2014 or more than 1 million gigabytes \u2014 and created\n\u201ccyber profiles\u201d for Coleman and Farrey, according to the filing.\n\nThose profiles were assembled from email addresses and social media accounts,\naccording to the filing. Cybercheck connected the profiles to the scene of the\nkilling within minutes of the homicide using a network address \u2014 a unique\nnumber that identifies devices connected to the internet \u2014 from a Wi-Fi-\nenabled security camera, according to the filing.\n\nAt least one device \u2014 possibly a phone \u2014 with a suspect\u2019s cyber profile had\ntried to communicate with the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection, according to the\nreport, Malarcik said.\n\nThe report didn\u2019t cite any video recording of the killing, and it wasn\u2019t clear\nwhere Cybercheck found the camera\u2019s network address or how it verified that\nthe device was at the scene. The defense\u2019s forensic experts were unable to\nlocate the social media accounts cited in the report, the filing says, and it\nwasn\u2019t clear how the software verified an email address that it said belonged\nto both defendants.\n\nAt a hearing last summer, Mosher testified that the software\u2019s conclusions in\nthe case were 98.2% accurate, according to the filing, which doesn\u2019t provide\nadditional details about how that accuracy rate was calculated.\n\nAt the hearing, Mosher said his software has never been peer-reviewed, the\nfiling says, noting that he provided the same testimony in an earlier case in\nAkron.\n\n### Recommended\n\nCulture & Trends\n\n### Culture & TrendsTiffany Haddish started tracking down her online trolls\nand calling them on the phone\n\nWeather\n\n### WeatherMandatory evacuations ordered in Texas after heavy rain and floods\n\nBut at a hearing in a third homicide case in Akron in October, Mosher said\nCybercheck was peer-reviewed by the University of Saskatchewan, according to a\nruling this year. The judge in that case ordered Mosher to provide the study\nto prosecutors and Malarcik, a copy of the ruling shows.\n\nThe 47-page document, which Malarcik said Mosher emailed him in February, is\nfrom 2019. It appears to be an instructional document for the software and\ndoesn\u2019t say who performed the review or include their findings.\n\nA University of Saskatchewan spokesman said the school had a research contract\nwith Global Intelligence that was connected to an agreement with Canada\u2019s\nNational Research Council, a science and technology agency focused on research\nand development.\n\nThe university \u201cwas not involved in the creation of the document, nor did we\ncreate any content for the document, nor can we say conclusively what\ninformation the company used to create it,\u201d the spokesman said in a statement.\n\nThe research done under the contract was never submitted anywhere, the\nspokesman said, \u201cand therefore was not peer-reviewed.\u201d\n\nGlobal Intelligence and the spokesman for the Summit County Prosecutor\u2019s\nOffice wouldn\u2019t comment on the document.\n\n## Data not preserved\n\nAccording to the defendant\u2019s April 10 filing in the Akron homicide\nprosecution, Cybercheck doesn\u2019t preserve the data it uses to create or locate\ncyber profiles.\n\nMosher didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on the apparent practice. In a\ntranscript of July proceedings in the case provided by Malarcik, Stano, the\nprosecutor, questioned Mosher about what data Cybercheck stores.\n\nMosher said the software doesn\u2019t index or collect data because it\u2019s a data\nprocessor, not a data collector. He cited the large sizes of the files, as\nwell as \u201cother considerations around governance and compliance,\u201d according to\nthe transcript.\n\nThe April 10 filing asks the judge to order Mosher to share Cybercheck\u2019s\nsoftware and points to other decisions in which judges have ruled that\ndefendants are entitled to review it. Mosher didn\u2019t respond to a question\nasking whether he planned to share Cybercheck\u2019s methodology, and Malarcik said\nhe wasn\u2019t aware whether Mosher had shared the software in any of the cases in\nwhich he has been ordered to.\n\nIn one such case \u2014 another Akron homicide, in which the defendant, Javion\nRankin, was charged with aggravated murder and other crimes in 2021 \u2014 Mosher\nrefused to provide the software\u2019s methodology because it is proprietary, a\nMarch 28 appeals filing shows. After that refusal, the judge barred\nprosecutors from introducing Cybercheck evidence in the case, the filing\nshows.\n\nProsecutors appealed the ruling, saying it \u201cdestroyed\u201d the possibility of an\neffective prosecution, a notice of appeal shows. Rankin was released on his\nown recognizance last year while the appeal moves forward, said Malarcik, who\nalso represents Rankin.\n\n## Expert testimony under scrutiny\n\nLawyers for Farrey and Coleman also point to claims Mosher made under oath in\nthe Rankin case in June about his experience as an expert witness.\n\nMosher said he has testified 13 times, the filing says, but he failed to\nprovide a list of cases after the judge requested one. At an April 2023\nhearing in Colorado for a case alleging child sex abuse image crimes, Mosher\ntold a judge he\u2019d testified just twice, the filing says.\n\nThe two cases Mosher cited in the Colorado hearing were linked to child sexual\nabuse image crimes in Canada, according to the filing. Mosher provided case\nnames and numbers, according to the filing, and during a hearing he said he\u2019d\nprovide trial transcripts.\n\nBut when an investigator for the lawyer in Colorado reached out, prosecutors\nin Canada said Mosher hadn\u2019t testified, the filing says, citing emails from\nthe officials.\n\nIn one case, Mosher provided material to authorities in Calgary, Alberta, that\nhe said he found on the dark web, the filing says.\n\n\u201cBut it was not usable disclosure,\u201d the prosecutor in that case said,\naccording to the filing. \u201cOur Internet Child Exploitation Unit technicians\nwere unable to read or analyze it or locate anything in the \u2018data dump.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe prosecutor added that the trial ended on the first day, when the accused\npleaded guilty, the filing says.\n\nIn the second case, in New Brunswick, the person Mosher identified as a\ndefendant hadn\u2019t even been charged, the filing says, citing a corporal with\nthe Royal Canadian Mounted Police\u2019s child exploitation unit.\n\nWhen prosecutors in Canada learned about Mosher\u2019s \u201cfalse testimony,\u201d the\nfiling says, they reached out to authorities handling the Colorado case.\n\nOn Aug. 4, prosecutors moved to dismiss the charges, a court filing shows. The\nfiling doesn\u2019t say why the Boulder County prosecutor sought the dismissal. A\nspokesperson for the DA\u2019s office declined to comment, citing a state law that\nbars her office from discussing cases that have been dismissed and sealed.\n\nMosher didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn the alleged robbery in Akron, Malarcik said he expects a decision in the\ncoming months about whether the judge in that case will order Mosher to turn\nover his software.\n\nTim Stelloh\n\nTim Stelloh is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital.\n\n\u00a9 2024 NBC UNIVERSAL\n\nWe and our partners use cookies on this site to improve our service, perform\nanalytics, personalize advertising, measure advertising performance, and\nremember website preferences.
