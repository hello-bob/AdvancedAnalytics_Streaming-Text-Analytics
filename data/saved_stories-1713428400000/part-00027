Yet on Election Night, residents had shocked the country by\nturning out for Donald Trump in record numbers.\n\nIn Zapata County, where Trump became the first Republican to win the\npresidential vote since Warren Harding in 1920, I asked Cynthia Villarreal, a\nlongtime Democratic organizer, what explained Trump\u2019s success after four years\nof immigration raids and family separation. Villarreal told me that, in South\nTexas, many Mexican Americans don\u2019t identify as immigrants; her own ancestors\nlived on the Rio Grande before Texas even existed. In Starr County, where\nTrump had almost quadrupled Republican turnout, the then\u2013county chair of the\nGOP, a retired colonel named Ross Barrera, said that he and many other Latinos\nin Texas wanted a border wall. He felt pity, but no solidarity, for those\ncrossing the border; he explained that some South Texans call them\nmojaditos\u2014Spanish for the slur \u201cwetback.\u201d\n\nSince 2020, Texas politicians have seemed to absorb the lesson that many\nLatinos will tolerate border crackdowns. In early 2021, Republican Governor\nGreg Abbott sent thousands of state police and National Guardsmen into Texas\u2019s\nsouthernmost counties as part of his \u201cOperation Lone Star.\u201d Residents appeared\nto reward him: Even if the police SUVs and razor wire were an eyesore, in the\n2022 governor\u2019s election Abbott improved on his 2018 results in almost every\nborder county.\n\nAdam Serwer: The Supreme Court has itself to blame for Texas defying its\norders\n\nBut soon, Texas Republicans could test just how harsh an immigration policy\nLatinos really want. In a raucous legislative session last year, the state\u2019s\nRepublican supermajority sent Abbott a monumental bill, S.B. 4. The law,\ncurrently on hold in the courts, would essentially give Texas its own\nimmigration system, making \u201cillegal entry\u201d\u2014traditionally enforced by the\nfederal government\u2014into a state crime. If the law goes into effect, a police\nofficer anywhere in the state will be able to stop, question, and arrest\nanyone they suspect might have crossed the Rio Grande illegally. Judges will\nbe able to coerce defendants to auto-deport to Mexico by threatening them with\nserious prison time.\n\nS.B. 4 would go far beyond Operation Lone Star, potentially moving immigration\nenforcement into the state\u2019s interior. Razor wire along the river is meant to\ncontrol who gets into the state; policing cities such as Dallas and Houston is\nabout getting people out. Will the Latinos in Texas who have welcomed\nRepublicans\u2019 border crackdown feel the same way if state police start\narresting their neighbors?\n\nThe history here looks grim for the GOP. When Republicans in California and\nArizona tried to create the same sort of \u201cshow me your papers\u201d\nsystem\u2014California\u2019s Proposition 187 and Arizona\u2019s S.B. 1070\u2014the measures\nbackfired. Both laws reeked of racial profiling. People who were around in\neach state, including my father in California, have told me stories from those\nyears. In Latino neighborhoods, many people came to see the laws not as\nimmigration policy, but as a population control: an attempt to make their\nstate less Latino. They responded by organizing into coalitions that\neventually eroded Republican power in both states\u2014and perhaps gave birth to\nthe popular assumption that Latinos vote mostly on immigration.\n\nIn California, my father was one of the people for whom Prop. 187\nfundamentally changed the way they saw themselves and their place in this\ncountry. Growing up in a Mexican American family in San Antonio, he didn\u2019t\nthink of himself as an immigrant. Like Villareal\u2019s family, our roots in Texas\nrun deeper than the state, back to when it was called Coahuila y Tejas. And,\nlike Barrera, my dad heard other Mexican kids at his school smear more recent\nimmigrants as mojaditos. When he moved to California in the 1980s, my father\nthought of himself as a political moderate. He was an entrepreneur and a\nfamily man, besides being Mexican by heritage. He voted for Ronald Reagan in\nthe 1984 presidential race (\u201cJust like everyone else in America,\u201d he joked to\nme recently).\n\nThings changed when the Republican governor of California, Pete Wilson,\nchampioned Prop. 187. California was in the midst of a historic immigration\nsurge, and as many as 1.3 million undocumented immigrants were living in the\nstate; Wilson was flagging in his 1994 reelection bid. The measure passed, and\nhe held on to his office. When the law went into effect, it instructed public\nemployees\u2014not just cops, but teachers, nurses, and anyone else who worked for\nthe state\u2014to report anyone they suspected might be undocumented.\n\n\u201cI had to start thinking: Was the name \u2018Herrera\u2019 probable cause?\u201d my dad said.\nProp. 187 erased the conceptual difference he might have felt between himself\nand noncitizens. He came to believe that, no matter how he thought of himself,\nsome people in this country would only ever see him as Mexican, as an\noutsider. He never voted Republican again.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t alone. In 1984, 45 percent of Latinos in California had, like my\nfather, voted for Reagan. By 1996, that support had cratered: More than 71\npercent of Latinos voted for Bill Clinton (a 16 percent increase over his own\n1992 result). Turnout among Latinos in California also increased dramatically\neach election year after Prop. 187. New Latino voters were far more likely to\nregister as Democrats; in Los Angeles County, for instance, six times as many\nLatinos registered with the Democratic Party than the GOP.\n\nProp. 187 \u201ccreated a multigenerational, anti-Republican coalition\u201d among\nLatinos in California, Mike Madrid, the political director of the California\nRepublican Party from 1996 to 1998, told me. Madrid, who grew up in a Mexican\nAmerican family in Sacramento, spent years trying to get Republican campaigns\nto understand Latinos\u2019 complexity. He thought then, and still thinks today,\nthat the party\u2019s best chance of courting Latino voters was with a message\ngeared toward the working class, an \u201caspirational conservatism.\u201d But Prop. 187\nessentially turned hundreds of thousands of Latinos into single-issue voters.\nToday some of the more prominent Latino officials in the country, including\nthe former San Antonio mayor and Housing and Urban Development secretary\nJuli\u00e1n Castro and Senator Alex Padilla of California, trace their political\nroots to their opposition to Prop. 187.\n\n\u201cYou can build a multigenerational coalition when a community is perceived to\nbe personally, individually, and as a community under attack,\u201d Madrid said.\n\u201cIf I was naturalized, or my kids were born here, or my grandchildren\u2014everyone\ncame home\u201d to Democrats after Prop. 187. (Madrid clashed with the Republican\nParty in a very public way when Donald Trump was nominated in 2016.)\n\nFrom the March 2022 issue: There\u2019s no such thing as \u2018the Latino vote\u2019\n\nProp. 187 died in the courts; judges ruled that it violated the supremacy\nclause in the Constitution and infringed on the federal government\u2019s exclusive\njurisdiction over immigration. Almost 15 years would pass before Republicans\ntried again, this time in Arizona, where Republican Governor Jan Brewer signed\nS.B. 1070 in 2010. Seeking to stop undocumented immigrants from accessing\npublic services, the law mandated that all immigrants over age 18 carry their\n\u201cpapers\u201d with them at all times, and it empowered cops to arrest anyone caught\nwithout proper ID.\n\nAcademics are still studying how S.B. 1070 changed Arizona. When the bill\npassed, the state had not only a Republican governor but two Republican\nsenators. Now a Democrat is in the governor\u2019s mansion, along with one and a\nhalf Democrats in the senate (Kyrsten Sinema became an independent in 2022).\nSince S.B. 1070, turnout has exploded in Latino communities, far outstripping\npopulation growth. In 2008, just 291,000 Latinos voted in Arizona. By 2012,\nturnout had increased to 400,000; by 2016, it was more than 550,000. Voter\nregistration has heavily favored Democrats. According to analysis by Televisa\nUnivision, as of 2022, just 17 percent of Latinos in Arizona are registered as\nRepublican, compared with 44 percent as Democrats and 39 percent as\nindependents.\n\nIn 2020, more than 813,000 Latinos showed up to vote in Arizona. While some\nLatino communities in Arizona saw a rightward shift, it was much more muted\nthan it was in Texas; some areas even shifted left. In all, Latino Arizonans\nvoted overwhelmingly for President Joe Biden, sealing his victory in the\nstate.\n\nUnderneath Biden\u2019s win was a large network of activists and a get-out-the-vote\ninfrastructure that had first gotten organized in response to S.B. 1070. Bel\u00e9n\nSisa, who immigrated with her parents from Buenos Aires at the age of 6, was\nin high school when the law passed. \u201cI was homecoming queen, varsity\ncheerleader\u2014like, the last person you would think would be the undocumented\ngirl,\u201d she told me. On the school bus each morning in Florence, Arizona, she\nlooked out at an ICE detention center that employed some of her classmates\u2019\nparents, and imagined getting locked up there.\n\nIn the years after the law passed, Sisa and her family saw cities like nearby\nMesa become relative \u201cghost towns\u201d as immigrants left the state in large\nnumbers. Sometimes, her family watched protests, but they were too frightened\nto join in. When Sisa went to college at Arizona State University, she began\nmeeting other undocumented young people, many of whom had started openly\nidentifying as \u201cDreamers.\u201d She became part of a group of activists that grew\nthroughout the state, often supporting Democrats\u2019 electoral efforts. By 2020,\nSisa herself was working as the national Latino press secretary for Senator\nBernie Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nIn 2012, the Supreme Court struck down the sections of S.B. 1070 that made\nimmigration violations state crimes\u2014though it allowed Arizona police to\ncontinue to question the immigration status of the people they stopped or\ndetained. At the time, some wondered whether the Supreme Court had handed a\nvictory to Democrats by keeping part of the law in place, because of how\nstrong Latino opposition to it was.\n\nSisa recalled having conversations with other Latinos, some of whom had\ncitizenship.\u201cI could say: \u2018You\u2019re a lot closer to my situation than you will\never be to people that are white and born here,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nAs any Texan will tell you, things are different down here. Latinos in the\nstate are more socially conservative than their counterparts farther west. Not\nonly do many of them not see themselves as immigrants\u2014many identify as\nracially white. Across the country, immigrants are also becoming a smaller\npercentage of the Latino population. It\u2019s tough to predict how S.B. 4 will\nplay out if it goes into effect.\n\n\u201cUnlike, say, people in New York, I think Hispanics in Texas are more open to\nthe idea that we need to close that border and do the right thing,\u201d Jason\nVillalba, who served as a Republican in the Texas house from 2013 to 2019,\ntold me.\n\nJerusalem Demsas: Texas pulls an ugly stunt on the border\n\nAs controversy around S.B. 4 has grown, and connections to laws like Prop. 187\nhave been drawn, some Republican architects of the bill have begun signaling\nthat they intend for the law to target recent border crossers, not immigrants\nalready living in the state. Texas Solicitor General Aaron Nielson told judges\nat a hearing last week, \u201cThere wouldn\u2019t be probable cause in almost all cases,\nunless a Texas officer sees somebody crossing the border.\u201d Abbott has been\nambiguous: After the law was blocked, he said, \u201cTexas has the legal authority\nto arrest people coming across the razor-wire barriers on our border.\u201d\n\nBut legislators have frequently referred to statewide enforcement. When the\nFort Worth chief of police released a video in March arguing that immigration\nenforcement should be left to the feds, Dade Phelan, the speaker of the Texas\nhouse, wrote on X: \u201cAny local law enforcement agency that refuses to enforce\nSenate Bill 4 is abandoning their sworn duty to uphold the rule of law.\u201d State\nSenator Charles Perry, the author of the bill, has said in interviews that\nTexas essentially was forced to pass S.B. 4, because of what lawmakers see as\ninaction by the Biden administration. The Constitution makes exceptions to\nfederal supremacy during times of \u201cinvasion,\u201d and Perry and other Republicans\nargue that migration constitutes an invasion, one that the feds have failed to\nprevent. \u201cWe\u2019re not challenging federal supremacy. We\u2019re saying you got\nsupremacy. You just chose not to do anything with it. We\u2019re going to take that\nrole for you,\u201d Perry told conservative news site The Texan. (Perry did not\nrespond to an interview request.)\n\nVillalba, the former Republican lawmaker, told me he is a believer in border\nsecurity; for him, and for many other Latinos in Texas, the fact that the\nstate wants more of a say in what happens on its own border makes sense. \u201cBut\nthis is different,\u201d he said about S.B. 4. \u201cOn a Saturday afternoon, when I\ntake my son to go play hockey, and I\u2019m wearing a baseball cap, and, you know,\nand a T-shirt that might not be as clean and crisp as I normally wear, and I\nhave brown hair and brown eyes and brown skin, are they going to do that to\nme\u201d\u2014ask for his papers\u2014\u201cin front of my son?\u201d\n\nDeep south in the Rio Grande Valley, Tania Chavez is the executive director of\nLUPE, a direct-aid organization founded by the labor-rights icon Cesar Chavez\n(no relation). She and her team have spent months running \u201cknow your rights\u201d\nclinics for community members to help them prepare for S.B. 4. She said she\nhas talked with parents about what will happen if they get arrested. \u201cWho\u2019s\ngoing to take legal guardianship of their kids? ... Who else is listed on your\nbank account? ... What is going to happen to your property? Those are all the\nthings that we\u2019re planning and thinking,\u201d she told me. At one recent meeting,\nChavez said she saw something she hadn\u2019t seen before: Two groups of young\npeople had driven all the way from Houston and Corpus Christi to join.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting to see a lot of new faces,\u201d she said.\n\nOn March 19, the Supreme Court briefly allowed S.B. 4 to go into effect,\nsending the law back to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, where judges\nissued a new injunction less than 24 hours later. Oral arguments are ongoing,\nand Texas\u2019s defense has gotten less vociferous. Last week, Nielson, Texas\u2019s\nlawyer, told judges: \u201cNow, to be fair, maybe Texas went too far. And that\u2019s\nthe question this court is going to have to decide.\u201d\n\nBut, during those few hours the law was in effect, I felt an alien thought\ncross my mind as I sat in my home in Austin: Should I start carrying my\npassport? I won\u2019t exaggerate how worried I felt; I\u2019m insulated by citizenship\nand light-beige skin. Just having that thought, however, made me dissociate:\nIt was like someone else had forced the worry into my brain.\n\nIt\u2019s a species of fear many people live with daily. In the Rio Grande Valley,\nChavez spent two decades of her life undocumented; she knows what it\u2019s like\ndriving to work each day wondering if a broken taillight will bring her time\nin this country to an end. She said that feeling is what gets many young\ncitizens engaged in organizing in the Valley.\n\nBut when asked if she thinks S.B. 4 might change the minds of Latinos who\naren\u2019t immigrants, who have so far supported Texas\u2019s border crackdown, Chavez\nwas dubious.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen until those people start\ngetting arrested,\u201d she said.\n\nJack Herrera is a Texas-based writer.
