The commission, with a majority\nof Democratic members, sought reclassification as a way to give the FCC the\nregulatory authority to establish significant net neutrality rules.\n\n### Related Stories\n\nNews\n\n### TikTok Faces Potential U.S. Ban As Joe Biden Signs National Security Bill;\nCEO Vows Court Fight And Says \u201cFacts And The Constitution Are On Our Side\u201d\n\nNews\n\n### Meta Eyeing \u201cEvents Related To TikTok Closely\u201d But Too Early To Talk\nImpact Of Possible Ban, CFO Says\n\nBut less than three years later, after Donald Trump became president, a\nRepublican-controlled FCC reversed net neutrality, to protest online and\noutside the FCC offices.\n\nOpponents of net neutrality argue that even without such regulation, the great\nfears that the internet would devolve into a tiered system of fast lanes has\nnot materialized.\n\nSupporters, though, note that a bevy of new state regulations has tempered the\nconduct of major internet providers.\n\nCongress has been unable to pass legislation that would codify net neutrality,\neven though there have been numerous attempts over the past 15 years to reach\na legislative compromise.\n\n\u201cFour years ago the pandemic changed life as we know it. We were told to stay\nhome, hunker down, and live online, said FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel, who\nheaded the push to reinstate the rules. \u201cSo much of work, school, and\nhealthcare migrated to the internet. If we wanted to engage with the world, we\nneeded to do it all through a broadband connection,\u201d she said at the hearing.\n\n\u201cIt became clear that no matter who you are or where you live, you need\nbroadband to have a fair shot at digital age success. It went from nice-to-\nhave to need-to-have for everyone, everywhere. Broadband is now an essential\nservice. Essential services\u2014the ones we count on in every aspect of modern\nlife\u2014have some basic oversight.\u201d\n\n## Must Read Stories\n\n  * ### Poppy Harlow To Depart CNN After 16 Years With WBD News Network\n\n  * ### Skydance Still In Pole Position For Paramount; Sony & Apollo Waiting In Wings\n\n  * ### Adam Scott To Direct K.
