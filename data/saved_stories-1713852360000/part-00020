Go to any local government meeting on new housing, and\nparking tends to come up even faster.\n\nSo it may be surprising to hear that in car-centric Los Angeles, thousands of\nnew apartments are now being developed with little to no on-site parking.\n\nSome neighbors worry any influx of renters without dedicated spots of their\nown will turn the hunt for street parking into a bloodsport. But housing\nadvocates say there are good reasons to build without parking. Eliminating\nparking requirements brings construction costs down and makes rents more\naffordable. They say lack of easy parking also encourages residents to use\nclimate-friendly public transportation options.\n\n\u201cWe all want to park free \u2014 including me,\u201d said Donald Shoup, a UCLA urban\nplanning professor. \u201cThe problem with parking requirements is that in some\ncases the required parking is so expensive that the developer never even\nthinks about proposing a development.\u201d\n\nSupport for LAist comes from\n\nBecome a sponsor\n\nShoup literally wrote the book on this subject. His seminal 2005 text The High\nCost of Free Parking explores how parking requirements have raised\nconstruction costs and reduced the types of housing that make financial sense\nto develop on expensive urban land.\n\nThat\u2019s because, Shoup said, \u201ca lot of buildings aren't built\u201d due to parking\nrequirements, \u201cespecially small apartment buildings.\u201d\n\nRenting In LA\n\n  * LA County Approves New Program To Fight Slum Housing With Regular Inspections\n\nApr 16, 2024\n\n  * LA County Leaders To Decide On Major Overhaul Of Apartment Inspections And Code Enforcement\n\nApr 15, 2024\n\n  * Saga To Defeat West LA Affordable Housing Project Continues As Opponents File Lawsuit\n\nApr 5, 2024\n\n## Why parking is no longer a given in new L.A. apartments\n\nRecent changes in state law have allowed developers to ditch on-site parking\nin many parts of L.A. County \u2014 an idea that would have been unthinkable in\nprevious decades.\n\nLaura Friedman, a Burbank state assembly member, authored a 2022 law that bans\ncities from requiring parking in apartment buildings within half a mile of a\nmajor public transit stop.\n\nThe state\u2019s density bonus law also lets 100% affordable projects reduce or\neliminate on-site parking.\n\n## Most of L.A.\u2019s new low-income projects have zero parking\n\nDevelopers in the city of L.A. are now seizing these opportunities, rolling\nout plans for thousands of new parking-free apartments.\n\nA recent analysis from real estate data firm ATC Research found that 73% of\nprojects being proposed through L.A. Mayor Karen Bass\u2019s affordable housing\nfast-tracking program ED1 feature no on-site parking.\n\nSupport for LAist comes from\n\nBecome a sponsor\n\nSome of those projects have drawn the ire of neighborhood groups.\n\n\u201cWe have neighbors who have lived in our neighborhoods for years and they are\naccustomed to using a car,\u201d said Conrad Starr, president of the Greater\nWilshire Neighborhood Council, which has expressed opposition to two ED1\nprojects in Larchmont and Windsor Village with no parking.\n\nExisting residents may end up needing to park many blocks away from where they\nlive, Starr said, which can pose real challenges for senior citizens or\nfamilies with young children.\n\n\u201cI'm primarily a bike rider, and I wish more people would ride bikes,\u201d Starr\nsaid. \u201cWhile we are creating new solutions as a city, and new opportunities\nfor lifestyles that don\u2019t require owning a personal car, that's just not going\nto solve it for everybody who's already here.\u201d\n\nStarr said one recent neighborhood council meeting regarding an ED1 project in\nLarchmont drew record attendance. Opponents flooded the council with letters\nexpressing concern about the 52-unit affordable housing project\u2019s lack of\nparking.\n\n> Parking is almost impossible both on weekends and weekdays, completely\n> inconveniencing residents who live on streets adjacent to Larchmont\n> Boulevard. This is the wrong place for more development.\n\n\u2014 Karen Fischer, neighborhood resident\n\n\u201cThose of us who live nearby and shop in Larchmont know how crowded the\nstreets are,\u201d wrote resident Karen Fischer. \u201cParking is almost impossible both\non weekends and weekdays, completely inconveniencing residents who live on\nstreets adjacent to Larchmont Boulevard. This is the wrong place for more\ndevelopment.\u201d\n\nA Metro Rail train carries passengers toward Los Angeles along the 210\nFreeway.\n\n(\n\nDavid McNew\n\n/\n\nGetty Images\n\n)\n\n## On-site parking boosts construction costs, increases rents\n\nHousing advocates say eliminating parking requirements has enabled developers\nto build lots of new housing that\u2019s affordable to L.A. renters with lower\nincomes.\n\nMost ED1 units will be reserved for households earning up to 80% of the area\u2019s\nmedian income \u2014 $70,650 for a one-person household \u2014 with studio apartments\nrenting for no more than $1,766 per month under current limits. If parking\nwere required in these buildings, ED1 proponents say, rents would be much\nhigher.\n\nStudies have shown that providing on-site parking in California raises\napartment construction costs by around $36,000 per unit and increases rents by\nabout $200 per month.\n\nScott Epstein, policy director for Abundant Housing L.A.. said scrapping\nparking is a no-brainer when L.A. needs to plan for 185,000 units of low-\nincome housing by 2029 under state law.\n\n> What's more important \u2014 more housing units or more space for cars? It's not\n> a hard choice in my book.\n\n\u2014 Scott Epstein, policy director for Abundant Housing L.A.\n\n\u201cWhen you're in an emergency of this proportion and you're trying to build\nhousing for folks, what's more important \u2014 more housing units or more space\nfor cars?\u201d Epstein said. \u201cIt's not a hard choice in my book.\u201d\n\n## Parking requirements continue in many areas\n\nParking mandates remain in place for L.A. County projects that are further\naway from major public transit options. But local lawmakers are slowly\nchipping away at those requirements.\n\nLast week, the L.A. County Board of Supervisors voted in favor of rules for\nunincorporated parts of the county requiring one parking spot per apartment \u2014\nregardless of the number of bedrooms \u2014 in buildings with 10 units or less.\nPrevious rules often required two spots per unit.\n\nThe new rules also allow larger projects to cut the amount of required parking\nby up to 50% if developers provide perks such as car-share spots, electric\nbike charging or space for small grocery stores.\n\nThe five-member Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to pass these parking\nreductions, but not without some trepidation. Before the vote, Supervisor\nJanice Hahn said, \u201cI think we're going to have some unintended consequences\nfrom this \u2014 some problems.\u201d\n\n## What L.A. housing looked like before parking mandates\n\nGartz Court in Pasadena is an example of a bungalow court, which were popular\nin Southern California before cars became the dominant form of transportation.\n\n(\n\nAaricka Washington\n\n/\n\nLAist\n\n)\n\nEpstein said Abundant Housing L.A. had hoped to see the county stick with an\nearly draft of the rules, which removed parking mandates entirely for projects\nwith 10 units or less.\n\nHe points out there\u2019s precedent in L.A. history.\n\n\u201cI used to live in a bungalow court,\u201d Epstein said, referring to the small,\ndetached rental home complexes developers once built here at large scale.\nWhile most of these bungalow courts predate the widespread adoption of\nautomobiles, Epstein said, \u201cThe building form, I think, is still very relevant\nfor Los Angeles.\u201d\n\nShoup, the UCLA professor, said the dawn of parking requirements in the early\nto mid-20th century all but killed the bungalow court and other low-rise forms\nof rental housing that didn\u2019t allow for the required two parking spots per\nunit.\n\n\u201cThe dingbats disappeared, but so did almost all small apartment buildings,\u201d\nShoup said. \u201cThe kind of housing that people loved in L.A. was just swept away\nby the first parking requirements.\u201d\n\n## Some developers still choose to provide parking\n\nGetting rid of parking requirements hasn\u2019t meant that L.A. developers are\nalways choosing to eliminate parking. Many still plan to provide it.\n\nTracey Burns is vice president of Century Housing, a lender for affordable\nhousing projects in L.A. She said nixing parking makes the most sense in areas\nwith plentiful bus lines or train stations. Car-free tenants in those\nneighborhoods appreciate not having to pay more for a parking spot they\u2019ll\nnever use. In less transit-rich areas, discounted rent might not be enough to\nlure tenants who still rely on cars \u2014 and a place to park them.\n\n\u201cIn areas such as the San Fernando Valley, where Metro transportation is\nlimited, we as a lender will put on our risk hat and assess whether this\ndevelopment would be able to fully lease up,\u201d Burns said.\n\nThere\u2019s also a state bill that, if passed, could make it difficult for tenants\nto own a car in one of these buildings. Senate Bill 834, authored by Sen.\nAnthony Portantino of Glendale, aims to ban cities from issuing overnight\nstreet parking permits to residents in new parking-free apartments.\n\n> We know that the elimination of parking does not reduce vehicle ownership.\n> Angelenos still depend on their cars.\n\n\u2014 Tracey Burns, Century Housing vice president\n\n\u201cWe know that the elimination of parking does not reduce vehicle ownership,\u201d\nBurns said. \u201cAngelenos still depend on their cars. But we also know that\npeople need a place to live before parking so it's kind of like a double-edged\nsword.\u201d\n\nCars drive down Fairfax Avenue, where developer Jason Grant plans to build\nlow-income apartments with no parking.\n\n(\n\nEvan Jacoby\n\n/\n\nLAist\n\n)\n\n## Reality check: Will future Angelenos still need a place to park?\n\nAccording to U.S Census Bureau data, less than 9% of L.A. County households\nare completely car-free. Some developers hope investments in public transit \u2014\nand Silicon Valley efforts to make private car ownership obsolete \u2014 could one\nday reduce L.A.\u2019s need for abundant parking.\n\nJason Grant, founder of Local Development LLC, recently attended an L.A. City\nCouncil committee meeting to speak against a challenge to a 100% affordable\nproject he\u2019s developing on Fairfax Avenue. Opponents with the group North\nOrange Grove Residents have seized on the 26-unit project\u2019s lack of parking.\n\nOn his way to the meeting, Grant saw something that put the whole fight in\nperspective.\n\n\u201cI'm on Beverly and La Brea, and I'm looking left at this Waymo car,\u201d Grant\nsaid. \u201cThere was nobody in the vehicle. It was driving itself.\u201d\n\nGrant estimated that excavating land and pouring concrete to create an\nunderground parking structure for the Fairfax project would cost upwards of $1\nmillion.\n\n\u201cYeah, I'm going to remove a million-dollar parking lot,\u201d Grant said. \u201cBecause\nthe parking will probably become obsolete in the next five to 10 years.\u201d\n\nThe city council\u2019s planning and land use committee unanimously voted down the\nchallenge to the Fairfax project.\n\n## How to watchdog your local government\n\nFor people who live in L.A., the Board of Supervisors and City Council have\nthe most direct impact on housing in your neighborhood.\n\n  * Learn more about who influences local housing policy\n\nThe best way to keep tabs on your own local government is by attending public\nmeetings for your city council or local boards.
