The site authors have been called out for\nbeing anti-trans. Kathleen Stock is acknowledged as a \u2018prominent gender-\ncritical\u2019 feminist.\u201d\n\nThis was part of an email sent to UnHerd at the start of January from an\norganisation called the Global Disinformation Index. It was their\njustification, handed down after a series of requests, for placing UnHerd on a\nso-called \u201cdynamic exclusion list\u201d of publications that supposedly promote\n\u201cdisinformation\u201d and should therefore be boycotted by all advertisers.\n\nThey provided examples of the offending content: Kathleen Stock, whose columns\nare up for a National Press Award this week, Julie Bindel, a lifelong\ncampaigner against violence against women, and Debbie Hayton, who is\ntransgender. Apparently the GDI equates \u201cgender-critical\u201d beliefs, or\nmaintaining that biological sex differences exist, with \u201cdisinformation\u201d \u2014\ndespite the fact that those beliefs are specifically protected in British law\nand held by the majority of the population.\n\nThe verdicts of \u201cratings agencies\u201d such as the GDI, within the complex\nmachinery that serves online ads, are a little-understood mechanism for\ncontrolling the media conversation. In UnHerd\u2019s case, the GDI verdict means\nthat we only received between 2% and 6% of the ad revenue normally expected\nfor an audience of our size. Meanwhile, neatly demonstrating the arbitrariness\nand subjectivity of these judgements, Newsguard, a rival ratings agency, gives\nUnHerd a 92.5% trust rating, just ahead of the New York Times at 87.5%.\n\nSo, what are these \u201cratings agencies\u201d that could be the difference between\nlife and death for a media company? How does their influence work? And who\nfunds them? The answers are concerning and raise serious questions about the\nfreedom of the press and the viability of a functioning democracy in the\ninternet age.\n\n***\n\nDisinformation only really became a discussion point in response to the Trump\nvictory in 2016, and was then supercharged during the Covid era: Google Trends\ndata shows that worldwide searches for the term quadrupled between June and\nDecember 2016, and had increased by more than 30 times by 2022. In response to\nthe supposed crisis, corporations, technology companies and governments all\nhad to show they were taking some form of action. This created a marketplace\nfor enterprising start-ups and not-for-profits to claim a specialism in\ndetecting disinformation. Today, there are hundreds of organisations who make\nthis claim, providing all sorts of \u201cfact-checking\u201d services, including\npowerful ratings agencies such as GDI and Newsguard. These companies act as\ninvisible gatekeepers within the vast machinery of online advertising.\n\nHow this works is relatively straightforward: in UnHerd\u2019s case, we contract\nwith an advertising agency, which relies on a popular tech platform called\n\u201cGrapeshot\u201d, founded in the UK and since acquired by Larry Ellison\u2019s Oracle,\nto automatically select appropriate websites for particular campaigns.\nGrapeshot in turn automatically uses the \u201cGlobal Disinformation Index\u201d to\nprovide a feed of data about \u201cbrand safety\u201d \u2014 and if GDI gives a website a\npoor score, very few ads will be served.\n\n\u201cThese companies act as invisible gatekeepers within the vast machinery of\nonline advertising.\u201d\n\nThe Global Disinformation Index was founded in the UK in 2018, with the stated\nobjective of disrupting the business model of online disinformation by\nstarving offending publications of funding. Alongside George Soros\u2019s Open\nSociety Foundation, the GDI receives money from the UK government (via the\nFCDO), the European Union, the German Foreign Office and a body called Disinfo\nCloud, which was created and funded by the US State Department.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, its two founders emerged from the upper echelons of\n\u201crespectable\u201d society. First, there is Clare Melford, whose biography\npublished by the World Economic Forum states that she had previously \u201cled the\ntransition of the European Council on Foreign Relations from being part of\nGeorge Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundation to independent status\u201d. She set up the\nGDI with Daniel Rogers, who worked \u201cin the US intelligence community\u201d, before\nfounding a company called \u201cTerbium Labs\u201d that used AI and machine learning to\nscour the internet for illicit use of sensitive data and then sold it\nhandsomely to Deloitte.\n\nTogether, they have spearheaded a carefully intellectualised definitional\ncreep as to what counts as \u201cdisinformation\u201d. Back when it was first set up in\n2018, they defined the term on their website as \u201cdeliberately false content,\ndesigned to deceive\u201d. Within these strict parameters, you can see how it might\nhave appeared useful to have dedicated fact-checkers identifying the most\negregious offenders and calling them out. But they have since broadened the\ndefinition to encompass anything that deploys an \u201cadversarial narrative\u201d \u2014\nstories that may be factually true, but pit people against each other by\nattacking an individual, an institution or \u201cthe science\u201d.\n\nGDI founder Clare Melford explained in an interview at the LSE in 2021 how\nthis expanded definition was more \u201cuseful\u201d, as it allowed them to go beyond\nfact-checking to targeting anything on the internet that they deem \u201charmful\u201d\nor \u201cdivisive\u201d:\n\n\u201cA lot of disinformation is not just whether something is true or false \u2014 it\nescapes from the limits of fact-checking. Something can be factually accurate\nbut still extremely harmful... [GDI] leads you to a more useful definition of\ndisinformation... It\u2019s not saying something is or is not disinformation, but\nit is saying that content on this site or this particular article is content\nthat is anti-immigrant, content that is anti-women, content that is\nantisemitic...\u201d\n\nLarger traffic websites are rated using humans, she explains, but most are\nrated using automated AI. \u201cWe actually instantiate our definition of\ndisinformation \u2014 the adversarial narrative topics \u2014 within the technology,\u201d\nexplains Melford. \u201cEach adversarial narrative is given its own machine-\nlearning classifier, which then allows us to search for content that matches\nthat narrative at scale... misogyny, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, anti-black\ncontent, climate change denial, etc.\u201d\n\nMelford\u2019s team and algorithm are essentially trained to identify and defund\nany content she finds offensive, not disinformation. Her personal bugbears are\nsomewhat predictable: content supporting the January 6 \u201cinsurrections\u201d, the\npernicious influence of \u201cwhite men in Silicon Valley\u201d, and anything that might\nundermine the global response to the \u201cexistential challenge of climate\nchange\u201d.\n\nThe difficulty, however, is that most of these issues are highly contentious\nand require robust, uncensored discussion to find solutions. Challenges to\nscientific orthodoxy are particularly important, as the multiple failures of\nthe official response to Covid-19 amply demonstrated. Indeed, one of the\nexamples of GDI\u2019s work that Melford highlighted in her LSE talk was an article\nabout the Delta variant of Covid-19. \u201cThis is a Spanish language site talking\nabout how a third of deaths in the United Kingdom from the Delta variant are\namongst those people who are vaccinated, which is clearly untrue,\u201d says\nMelford. \u201cIt is Chipotle that has been caught next to this ad unwittingly, and\nunfortunately for them have funded this highly dangerous disinformation about\nvaccines.\u201d\n\nThe statistic being reported comes from a June 2021 Public Health England\nreport into Covid variants that sets out the 42 known deaths from the Delta\nvariant from January to June: 23 were unvaccinated, 7 vaccinated with one shot\nand 12 fully vaccinated. In other words, 29% were fully vaccinated \u2014 around a\nthird \u2014 and 17% partially vaccinated, making a total of 45% vaccinated. To\nfurther complicate the question, Melford misread the Spanish headline, and it\nactually referenced two thirds, or 66%, which is wrong again.\n\nExamples like this are far from rare. The GDI still hosts an uncorrected 2020\nblog about the \u201cevolution of the Wuhan lab conspiracy theory\u201d surrounding\nCovid-19\u2019s origins, which concludes that \u201ccutting off ads to these fringe\nsites and their outer networks is the first action needed\u201d. This is despite\nthe fact that Facebook and other tech companies long ago corrected similar\npolicies and conceded that it was a legitimate hypothesis that should never\nhave been censored.\n\n***\n\nIn the US, a number of media organisations have started to take action against\nGDI\u2019s partisan activism, prompted by a GDI report in 2022 that listed the 10\nmost dangerous sites in America. To many, it looked simply like a list of the\ncountry\u2019s most-read conservative websites. It even included RealClearPolitics,\na well-respected news aggregator whose polling numbers are among the most\nquoted in the country. The \u201cleast risk of disinformation\u201d list was,\npredictably enough, populated by sites with a liberal inclination.\n\nIn recent months, a number of American websites have launched legal challenges\nagainst GDI\u2019s labelling system, which they claim infringes upon their First\nAmendment rights. In December, The Daily Wire and The Federalist teamed up\nwith the attorney general of Texas to sue the state department for funding GDI\nand Newsguard. A separate initiative to prevent the Defense Department from\nusing any advertiser that uses Newsguard, GDI or similar entities has been\nsuccessful, and is now part of federal law.\n\nBut GDI is a British company and, on this side of the Atlantic, the\nConservative Government continues to fund it. A written question from MP\nPhilip Davies last year revealed that \u00a32.6 million was given in the period up\nto last year, and that there is still \u201cfrequent contact\u201d between the GDI and\nthe FCDO \u201cCounter Disinformation and Media Development\u201d unit.\n\n***\n\nYesterday, I was invited to give evidence to the House of Lords Communication\nand Digital Committee during which I outlined the extent of the threat to the\nfree media of self-appointed ratings agencies such as the Global\nDisinformation Index. The reality, as I told Parliament, is that GDI is merely\nthe tip of the iceberg. At a time when the news media is so distrusted and\nfaces a near-broken business model, the role of government should be to\nprevent, not encourage, and most certainly not fund, consolidations of\nmonopoly power around certain ideological viewpoints.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t simply a matter for the media. Both companies and those in the\nadvertising sector also need to act: it cannot be good marketing for brands to\ntarget only half the population. Last year, Oracle announced it was cutting\nties with GDI on free speech grounds, but as we discovered, it seems they are\nstill collaborating via the Grapeshot plaform: is Larry Ellison aware of this?\n\nAt its heart, the disinformation panic is becoming a textbook example of how a\n\u201csolution\u201d can do more harm than the problem it is designed to address.\nEducated campaigners such as Clare Melford may think they are doing the world\na service, but in fact they are acting as intensifying agents, lending\nlegitimacy to a conspiratorial world view in which governments and\ncorporations are in cahoots to censor political expression. Unless something\nis done to stop them, they will continue to sow paranoia and distrust \u2014 and\nhasten us towards an increasingly radicalised and divided society.\n\n***\n\nThis article has been updated to reference the fact that Clare Melford misread\nthe headline about deaths from the Delta variant, and it actually claimed 2/3\nnot 1/3.\n\nFreddie Sayers is the Editor-in-Chief & CEO of UnHerd.

Already there are assaults on the notion of the jury\ntrial, where the individual citizen is trusted to sieve fact from opinion and\nwhich functions as the most fundamental way in which the citizen participates\nin government. Now the totalitarians wish to extend their control to the arena\nof public debate. I\u2019m reading Richard Pipes\u2019s excellent history of the Russian\nRevolution, and while the passage is too long to quote in full, the relevant\nsection is as follows:\n\n> A brilliant if little-known French historian, Augustin Cochin, first showed\n> the peculiarly destructive intellectual atmosphere that had prevailed in\n> France in the decades immediately preceding the Revolution. He began his\n> inquiries with a study of Jacobinism. Seeking its antecedents, he was led to\n> the social and cultural circles formed in France in the 1760s and 1770s to\n> promote \u201cadvanced\u201d ideas. These circles, which he called societes de pensee,\n> were made up of literary associations, Masonic lodges, academies, as well as\n> various \u201cpatriotic\u201d and cultural clubs. According to Cochin, the societes de\n> pensee insinuated themselves into a society in which the traditional estates\n> were in the process of disintegration. To join them required severing\n> connections with one\u2019s social group and dissolving one\u2019s class (estate)\n> identity in a community bound exclusively by a commitment to common ideas.\n> Jacobinism was a natural product of this phenomenon: in France, unlike\n> England, the movement for change emanated not from parliamentary\n> institutions but from literary and philosophical clubs.\n>\n> These circles, in which the historian of Russia recognizes many of the\n> features of the Russian intelligentsia of a century later, had as their main\n> mission the forging of a consensus: they achieved cohesion not through\n> shared interests but through shared ideas, ruthlessly imposed on their\n> members and accompanied by vicious attacks on all who thought differently:\n>\n> Prior to the bloody terror of \u201993, there existed, between 1765 and 1780, a\n> dry terror in the republic of letters, of which the Encyclopedia was the\n> Committee of Public Safety and d\u2019Alembert was Robespierre. It mowed down\n> reputations as the other did heads: its guillotine was defamation...\n>\n> For intellectuals of this kind, the criterion of truth was not life: they\n> created their own reality, or rather, sur-reality, subject to verification\n> only with reference to opinions of which they approved.

I\nhave had comments that are inline with consensus (below line) and ones that\nare not disappear. I have, on numerous occasions, speculated that the comment\nsystem is automated and likely triggered by downvotes (among other things),\nwhich explain why certain commentators (such as CS, who is generally just\ntrolling anyway) almost always disappear after a certain threshold but will\nreappear sometime later. I think Unherd is using WordPress for the comments\n(at the very least) \u2013 a few years back the website had crashed and it\ncontained a WordPress error message. WordPress is rather draconian, and I\nsuspect that Unherd have limited capacity to configure the behaviour of the\nsystem \u2013 particularly since most of the comments that disappear do come back\nagain, which suggests someone\u2019s time is being wasted. Comments that should be\nremoved (e.g. offensive, and not just in Scotland) are rare. However, this is\nstill my biggest gripe about Unherd, paying for a subscription grants the\nright to comment. Removal of comments is not just a waste of money but also\ntime. As such, I support all comments to remain (egregious breaches of\netiquette aside). Finally, if Unherd\u2019s mission statement is to provide a\ndiversity of opinion, surely the whole point is to have those opinions\nchallenged? An idea that has been challenged and passes is a robust one.\n\n5\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nD Glover\n\n4 days ago\n\nReply to Andrew Dalton\n\nI would draw the line at threats or incitement to violence.

The former are more\ndangerous as they will go to great lengths and cause significant suffering to\naccomplish their ideological goals. They will steer the ship true to their\nguiding principles even as it burns and falls to pieces around them. The\nlatter group, the opportunists, can be relied upon to bail out and abandon the\ncause well before that point. I remain skeptical of their ability to actually\nretain control for any significant period of time or accomplish much. I\u2019m\nfairly sure the Jacobins never intended the Napoleonic Empire, nor did the\nBolsheviks imagine the horrors of Stalin. That is, however, what they\nultimately got. In the end, their basic nature fails them. The same commitment\nto ideals that drives them to enforce conformity and establish a consensus\namong themselves and enforce it from the top down also limits their\nintellectual breadth and their ability to adapt to rapidly changing\ncircumstances.

And that, of course, can change\naccording to political fashion. This is a very poor protection indeed compared\nwith the certainty that you can defend your right to say something because you\nhave the facts to hand. It is in fact a gift to totalitarianism that it is now\nthe business of the State to determine that facts are now beliefs which either\nfit into a political definition of acceptability or otherwise.

(It is of\ncourse) The point of free speech is the pursuit of truth. But truth itself\ncannot be the thing that justifies any specific instance of unwelcome speech.\nIf we can only say unwelcome things on the basis that they are true then\nultimately, we are prevented from saying things that might be true. And if you\ndon\u2019t have the right to be wrong without consequence then you don\u2019t have a\nfield of free inquiry in order to work out how to be right (or at least less\nwrong). The very mechanism of truth-finding (hypothesis -> antithesis ->\nsynthesis) relies upon the existence of error. It is not established truth\nthat we need to protect but error.

The NGO lobby works the systems and committees but often\ndon\u2019t represent anything except their own interests, or the interests of their\nfunders. An activist group funds or creates an NGO. The NGO lobbies in the\nback rooms, hidden from public scrutiny, on something that at first looks\nmarginal or technical, they then receive government funding for their work,\nand their mandate and influence grow like a virus, with the public purse\ncoming in to pay for their work, which then leads to more lobbying via the\nmoney-go-round. This allows activists to play behind the scenes for objectives\nthat have little public support, yet when the public find out and object or\npush back, somehow this then becomes \u2018populist\u2019 and \u2018anti-democratic\u2019. One key\nis to disallow anyone who lobbies from getting public funds or contracts and\nto do some detailed studies of the funding networks, not just the funding of\nthe NGOs themselves.

One that needs to be ended.\n\nI have in the past called for Freddie to publish an article on the malign\neffects of the algorithms that Unherd subscribes to monitor our comments here.\nI have always been puzzled by Unherd\u2019s reluctance to do so as the crude\nalgorithms undoubtedly have a woke bias that is contrary to what Unherd stands\nfor. But perhaps discussing such a subject would merely have exacerbated the\nhidden pressure on Unherd to censor opinions and articles that go against the\nviews of the the hidden censors that have been revealed in this article.\nPerhaps it it only because the malignancy of the censors discussed in this\narticle is so clear that Unherd have been prepared to draw the curtain back\nand are emboldened by the fight back by conservatives in the US against this\nform of ideological censorship.\n\n0\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nHugh Bryant\n\n4 days ago\n\nReply to Jim Veenbaas\n\n... and very few people realise how deeply entrenched they are in our\ngovernment and media.

Probably the same is true of this GDI racket.\n\n1\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nAlex Carnegie\n\n4 days ago\n\nReply to Jim Veenbaas\n\nI agree and thought Freddie\u2019s expose was another excellent piece of\njournalism. Four points:\n\n1/ We have been here before. Each technological shift in mass communication \u2013\nprinting, newspapers, radio, TV, cable news, etc \u2013 has been disruptive and\ndestabilising but eventually a new regime with some checks and balances\nemerges e.g. free speech + libel laws for printing (though only after the\nimmediate effect in Europe of printing being a 100 years of religious wars).\n\n2/ If we set out to design a new system of checks and balances for this brave\nnew online world then it will not be sufficient to chant \u201cfree speech\u201d and\nother traditional slogans. As this case illustrates there are entirely new\nchallenges such as defunding and amplification. It matters little if everyone\nis free to speak if the debate is being manipulated to produce an specific\nconsensus / orthodoxy. This is complicated and needs new thinking.\n\n3/ If one takes GDI it appears to have started as an attempt to counteract the\npolarising effects of FB etc algorithms which steered traffic to and amplified\nextreme content to the point where it supposedly threatens civil war. This was\nnot a silly objective. FB\u2019s pursuit of profitability by maximising\n\u201cengagement\u201d i.e. anger was irresponsible. It is only later that GDI has\nmutated into a coercive tool for discouraging gender critical and other\nunprogressive views.\n\n4/ If any future regime tames the debate online \u2013 and renders it constructive\nand free \u2013 then it will probably, as with printing, involve checks and\nbalances not just prescription. It is like creating a new balanced ecosystem:\nyou need predators, herbivores and vegetables. In this context I would not be\nsurprised if GDI style tools end up playing a useful role \u2013 so long as they\nare only mild correctives to a basically free and honest debate and are\ntransparent in their methodology.\n\n0\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nJeremy Bray\n\n4 days ago\n\nReply to Alex Carnegie\n\nI agree that online discussion and comment can descend into outright lies,\nflame wars and mere propaganda that no one wishes to wade through to find the\nuseful comments and articles.\n\nThe manner in which discussions are conducted, the terms of engagement as it\nwere, are important issues that need to be discussed openly not smuggled in\ncovertly by parties with their own biases.\n\n0\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nLancashire Lad\n\n4 days ago\n\nReply to Alex Carnegie\n\nDetailed and incisive analysis; precisely why i subscribe to Unherd.

BUT it is a matter of balance. GDI appears to overreaching. Likewise,\na few wolves introduced into a national park weed out the weaker deer and\nprevent overgrazing thus leading to a stronger overall ecosystem with more\ntrees, water, etc. Either no wolves or too many has unfortunate side effects.\nIn the West we tend to think in binaries i.e. good vs bad but often good =\nbalance between different forces.\n\n0\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nLancashire Lad\n\n4 days ago\n\nReply to Alex Carnegie\n\nMore excellent analogies.

People become more vulnerable to absurd\nideas not only because they are ignorant about an issue, and thus easy to fool\n\u2013 but also when too many in authority deny an issue even exists.

But a broader paradigm does hold, which is the the\nshifting baseline theory. The shifting baseline theory was first proposed by a\nfisheries biologist, who found that people in their anecdotal sense of the\nsize and abundance of fish tend to consider that the normal range is whatever\nthey experienced while growing up. Thus, older fishermen would complain that\nthe fish are smaller and less abundant, while young and middle-aged fishermen\nwould say that not much has changed; that the fish ecosystem is steady. Data-\ndriven analysis confirms that the fish we catch commercially are indeed\nsmaller \u2014 you can see it easily in historical photographs. The driving force\nis that our sensory perceptions are not evolved to record absolute measures\nbut rather to discern differences. In that view it is natural that we ignore\ngradual changes, whether in our environment or in our ideas; it is only when\nsomebody takes the trouble to collect the long perspective that gradual trends\n(or degraded thought processes) become apparent.

I should be\ngrateful if you would watch this video, which is very reasoned and makes an\nexcellent case against organisations such as the GDI.\nhttps://unherd.com/2024/04/inside-the-disinformation-industry/ As you will\nhave seen in the Unherd film referenced above, Philip Davies MP has submitted\na parliamentary question on the matter. The answer should cause you the same\nconsternation as it does me. It would seem that the UK government is\ninfringing on the freedom of expression of conservative voices by funding and\nsupporting organisations such as the GDI, who base their activities on\nopinion, partial information and outright falsehood. I do not consider it\nappropriate for the UK government to be acting in this manner. It would seem\nthat the UK government is funding an organisation that (a)dishonestly makes\n(a) false representation(s), and. (b)intends, by making the representation\u2014\n(i)to make a gain for himself or another, or. (ii)to cause loss to another or\nto expose another to a risk of loss \u2013 contrary to the Fraud Act 2006. I should\nbe grateful to hear what you will do to support freedom of expression in the\nUK against initiatives such as the GDI and the BBC\u2019s Disinformation Unit, run\nby Marianna Spring, who aptly describes herself as a \u2018disinformation\nspecialist\u2019, and whether it is appropriate for the UK government to support\norganisations that use fraud as part of their business model.

And\nthat\u2019s only the start. People will be nervous about subscribing or\ncontributing to particular websites when there is a risk that they could be\ndebanked, which these days means being left to starve. If they are\nphotographed at a political event like yesterday\u2019s NatCon conference, or even\na local protest about traffic restrictions, they could appear via facial\nrecognition software on a police database as \u201cfar right\u201d. They can be\ndenounced by someone for in work or even in their own home under Hate Speech\nlegislation or Corporate policies, thus rendered unemployable. And when\noppositional media outlets have been rendered sufficiently financially\nvulnerable they can be shut down via lawfare, safe in the knowledge they can\u2019t\nafford to fight back, and even if they could, they would lose, because judges\nand regulators are drawn from the same dominant class.

Try to avoid things\nwhich sound like GB News talking points and use examples from the recent past\nto jolt people. For example what if the government has done this in the 1980s\nwhen campaign groups like Stonewall and Greenpeace had just been getting\ngoing? How about the courageous Hillsborough families? Or the victims of Jimmy\nSavile? They all had adversarial narratives which challenged the mainstream or\nestablishment version of \u201cthe truth\u201d How would they have got the truth out?\n\nBetter still, go along to hustings events and ask the question.

Their basic\ninformation is manipulated by the AI to create a document that is a deception.\nIn the first instance it gives an impression of communication skills that are\nnot real, then progresses to massage facts into something between subtly\ndifferent to downright mendacious. Expand this through all areas of online\ncommunication and the depth and breadth of potential deception is endless.
