The film was a box office bomb in the United States, failing to\ncross the $100 million mark despite a production and marketing budget that was\nreportedly over $300 million. \u201c2049\u201d is said to have cost Alcon Entertainment\nat least $80 million. As Villeneuve said: \u201cThe miracle for me about \u2018Blade\nRunner 2049\u2019 is the following: I\u2019m still making movies and you\u2019re still\ntalking to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew that when I did this movie I flirted with disaster,\u201d the filmmaker\ncontinued. \u201cI put myself into massive artistic danger. That was walking, as\nChristopher Nolan said to me once...walking on sacred territory. It\u2019s true. It\nwas sacrilegious what I did. I was told, \u2018You don\u2019t do that.\u2019 Just the fact\nthat I\u2019m still here making movies, for me...at least I wasn\u2019t banned from the\nfilmmaker community. It was a dangerous game.\u201d\n\nRelated Stories\n\nSteven Spielberg Calls \u2018Dune: Part Two\u2019 Sandworm Scene \u2018One of the Greatest\nThings I\u2019ve Ever Seen\u2019\n\nLittle Time Passed Between \u2018Dune\u2019 and \u2018Dune: Part Two,\u2019 but Worlds Changed\n\nVilleneuve is still very much making movies, and huge ones at that. The\ndirector\u2019s \u201cDune\u201d adaptation arrives in U.S. theaters and HBO Max on October\n22 and has already begun rolling out overseas to impressive box office\nnumbers. Should \u201cDune\u201d perform well enough, Warner Bros. and Legendary\nEntertainment will greenlight the next film in his intended two-part \u201cDune\u201d\nadaptation. In an interview last year, Villeneuve discussed how different it\nwas to tackle \u201cBlade Runner 2049\u201d and \u201cDune.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith \u2018Blade Runner\u2019 and \u2018Dune,\u2019 it\u2019s two different pressures,\u201d Villeneuve\nsaid. \u201cWith \u2018Blade Runner\u2019 I had to be respectful of Ridley Scott\u2019s\nmasterpiece. It was more an act of love. Here\u2019s it\u2019s totally different. I\u2019m\ndealing with the pressure of the dreams I had as a teenager. I was a big\ndreamer. I dreamed big when I was younger. That teenager in me is totalitarian\nand I had to please those dreams. That was the biggest challenge.\u201d\n\nVilleneuve has been vocal from the start about his \u201cDune\u201d adaptation being\ndriven by \u201cthe images\u201d and dreams that he envisioned while first reading Frank\nHerbert\u2019s novel as a teenager. For this reason, Villeneuve has told fans that\nhis \u201cDune\u201d will have no stylistic similarities to David Lynch\u2019s 1984 \u201cDune\u201d\nfilm adaptation.\n\nDaily Headlines\n\nDaily Headlines covering Film, TV and more.\n\nSubscribe\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\nThe Force Was Strong\n\n10 Years Ago the \u2018Force Awakens\u2019 Cast Photo Was Revealed, and the Future for\n\u2018Star Wars\u2019 Seemed Limitless\n\nFilmmaker Interview\n\nJane Schoenbrun on How the Dread and Deterioration of \u2018Twin Peaks: The Return\u2019\nInfluenced \u2018I Saw the TV Glow\u2019\n\nstakeout\n\nHow \u2018The Sympathizer\u2019 Turned Robert Downey Jr. Into the Specter of the West\n\nFeatures\n\n\u2018Challengers\u2019 Is a \u2018Pure Fantasy for Me,\u2019 Says Screenwriter Justin Kuritzkes\n\nLike This?
