It's fast. And it's fun!\n\nWhat\u2019s Slowing You Down?\n\nWhat is your biggest inhibitor to shipping software faster?\n\nComplicated codebase and technical debt.\n\nQA, writing tests, and debugging.\n\nWaiting for PR review or stakeholder approval.\n\nI'm always waiting due to long build times.\n\nRework due to unclear or incomplete specifications.\n\nInadequate tooling or infrastructure.\n\nOther.\n\nWe'd love to hear what you think.\n\nDebugging software that is running 150 million miles away is something most of\nus will never have to do, thankfully. But one former NASA programmer, software\nengineer Ron Garret, shared his experience of diagnosing faulty LISP software\non a Deep Space spacecraft mission, in one recent episode of Adam Gordon\nBell\u2019s Corecursive podcast.\n\nGarret shared a remarkable story about debugging in deep space \u2014 along with\nsome memories from the early days of programming. Along the way, Garret\noffered a refreshing perspective on what\u2019s changed \u2014 and what hasn\u2019t \u2014 in the\nworld of programming. Garret also explored the unique challenges of writing\ncode for a spacecraft.\n\nAnd he remembered his starring role in one truly glorious moment from the\nhistory of Lisp.\n\n## Superpowered User\n\nGarret had worked as a research scientist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory\nfrom 1988 until 2000 \u2014 and again from 2001 through 2004. Garret\u2019s specialty:\nautonomous mobile robots. He helped to pioneer what is today the de-facto\nstandard autonomous mobile robot control architecture.\n\nGarret\u2019s team worked on prototypes for the robotic Mars rover Sojourner.\n\nOn the podcast Garret described the very limited programming options in 1988 \u2014\na world before Java, Python, JavaScript, and even C++. \u201cThere is Pascal and C\nand Basic and machine code. And that\u2019s pretty much it in terms of popular\nlanguages. To get anything done in any of those languages is just really,\nreally hard.\u201d The code for most spacecraft ended up being written in assembly\nlanguage.\n\nBut then there was Lisp \u2014 a language based on abstracting problems cleanly\ninto lists and functions. And while C programmers worry about things like\ndangling pointers, Lisp also has automatic memory management. \u201cIt\u2019s just so\nmuch faster and easier to get things done when the language you\u2019re using\nprovides you with some of these high level abstractions,\u201d Garret remembered on\nthe podcast. \u201cAnd in a world where the only language that has that is Lisp,\nknowing Lisp really is like a superpower.\n\nTRENDING STORIES\n\n  1.

The Thorny Ethics of Computer Programming\n  5. The Ultimate Logistics Problem: Building the Great Pyramid of Giza\n\n> With Lisp, \u201cevery problem becomes a compiler problem\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just blew everything else out of the water back in those days.\u201d\n\nBack in the day, Lisp really wasn\u2019t used that much around NASA though.\n\n\u201cThere was quite a bit of prejudice against Lisp because it was weird and\nunfamiliar, and it had this strange garbage collection technology that you\njust never knew when it would just stop your process dead in its tracks,\u201d\nGarrett recalled.\n\nGarret\u2019s group found it useful for memory-constrained hardware. Lisp could be\nused to fashion a custom language specifically for the problem at hand, and\nthen compiling it for the robot\u2019s hardware. Or, as Bell puts it, \u201cevery\nproblem becomes a compiler problem.\u201d Garret\u2019s team painstakingly wrote and\ntested their code on a robot simulator (on a Macintosh computer) before\ninstalling it in the actual rover and performing a time-consuming test drive\nout into the Arroyo.\n\nDespite the code base the group developed, when the Sojourner rover reached\nMars, it was powered with C code.\n\nYet in 1998 a new NASA director launched NASA\u2019s New Millennium project \u2014 a\npilot program for demonstrating different (and cheaper) technologies, through\na number of deep space exploratory missions.\n\nThis meant their Lisp code got a second life, Garret remembered on the\npodcast. The autonomy technology that the team had started developing for\nrovers was repurposed. Its new mission? Flight controller.\n\nGarret\u2019s team worked on an innovative decision-making software \u2014 using a\ncustom language written in Lisp specifically designed to avoid the possibility\nof a dreaded \u201crace condition\u201d (where two concurrently running threads fight\nfor the same memory space). \u201cIt was tested for days and days and days\u201d \u2014 on\nthe exact same hardware was going into space. \u201cSo we were very confident that\nit was going to work.\n\n\u201cAnd it didn\u2019t work...\u201d\n\n## Deep Space Failure\n\nGarret explains that during their three days of flight-controlling, \u201cThere was\na time at which it was supposed to do something and that time came and went\nand it didn\u2019t do the thing it was supposed to do. And alarm bells rang...\n\n\u201cNow this code that\u2019s been proven deadlock-free seems to be frozen 150 million\nmiles from home.\u201d\n\nIt was a tense situation. \u201cWe had no idea what was going on.... And everything\nthat we did when we decided to do something, we would do it and then we\u2019d sit\naround and wait an hour for the result.\u201d After a team in a conference room\nreached their consensus, their commands \u201cwent through a review process that\nconsisted of a number of layers of management, all of whom had to sign off on\nit.\u201d\n\nAfter approvals were obtained, the commands went out through a dedicated\nhardwired network to one of the Deep Space network 70 meter-wide antennas,\nwhich sent the commands flying through space at the speed of light...\u201d\n\nFirst they requested a backtrace \u2014 a common programming operation that\ngenerates a list of all the currently-active processes (and, as Garret\ndescribed it, \u201cwhat they\u2019re waiting for.\u201d)\n\n\u201cIt was actually almost immediately obvious what was going wrong because there\nwas this one process that was waiting for something that should have already\nhappened...\n\n> Ron dug up these photos that are very cool pic.twitter.com/9PbnYXw5PU\n>\n> \u2014 Adam Gordon Bell \ud83e\udd13 (@adamgordonbell) May 2, 2022\n\n\u201cThe problem was that there was, in fact, a race condition. Which was supposed\nto have been impossible.\u201d Unfortunately, one of Garret\u2019s coders had called a\nlower-level Lisp function \u2014 which had inadvertently created \u201can end-run around\nthe safety guarantees\u201d of their carefully-customized language. (Garret blames\nhimself for not explaining this more clearly to the coder.)\n\nThe team decided to \u201cmanually\u201d trigger the event \u2014 which got the software\nrunning again.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t lose the spacecraft and we did accomplish all of the mission\nobjectives \u2014 so technically it was a success,\u201d Garret said on the podcast.\n\u201cBut the development process was so painful and fraught with difficulty \u2014 and\nagain, there were politics. So despite the fact that we actually did manage to\nget it to work, the autonomy project was canceled after that and it never flew\nagain.\u201d\n\nA 2002 essay on Garret\u2019s personal web site argues that \u201cThe demise of Lisp at\nJPL is a tragedy. The language is particularly well suited for the kind of\nsoftware development that is often done here: one-of-a-kind, highly dynamic\napplications that must be developed on extremely tight budgets and schedules.\u201d\n\nBut Lisp was passed over for C++, and then Java, with the rationale given as\nan attempt to follow \u201cbest practices.\u201d Garret\u2019s response? \u201cWe\u2019re confusing\nbest practice with standard practice. The two are not the same.\u201d And even\nbeyond that, what\u2019s ultimately best isn\u2019t an unvarying standard, but should\ndepend on the particulars of the current project at hand.\n\nBut in a discussion on Hacker News, one commenter identified themself as a\nNASA engineer who\u2019d been the payload software engineer for a 2009 mission\nexploring the moon\u2019s south pole \u2014 and said they\u2019d used Lisp to write their own\ncustom language for instrument command sequences (and for simulating the\ncomputer). \u201cLisp\u2019s simple, flexible syntax and macros made it easy to express\npatterns of commanding and timing for this.\u201d\n\nSo they left Garret with a reassuring thought: \u201cI think Lisp is still used in\nvarious nooks and crannies of NASA.\u201d\n\n# WebReduce\n\n  * 25 years ago IBM\u2019s \u201cDeep Blue\u201d become the world\u2019s chess champion.\n  * Creativity at work: Harvard Business Review gets advice from a Cirque du Soleil executive.\n  * Researchers powered a computer for one year with algae.\n  * Twitter creates a retro videogame out of their new privacy policy.\n  * How ABBA finally reunited for 196 concerts \u2014 using virtual avatars.\n\nDavid Cassel is a proud resident of the San Francisco Bay Area, where he's\nbeen covering technology news for more than two decades.
