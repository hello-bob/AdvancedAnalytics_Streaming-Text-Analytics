This means that you have accepted full\nresponsibility for the operation of your own mind, so that if you're offended,\nit's your own fault. The underlying assumption is that rudeness is sometimes\nnecessary for effective conveyance of information, if only to signal a lack of\npatience or tolerance: after all, knowing whether the speaker is becoming\nangry or despondent is useful rational evidence. Two people using Crocker's\nRules should be able to communicate all relevant information in the minimum\namount of time, without paraphrasing or social formatting.\n\nThus, one who has committed to these rules largely gives up the right to\ncomplain about emotional provocation, \"flaming\", \"trolling\", \"abuse\"\n(hopelessly subjective terms) and other alleged violations of etiquette. They\ngive these rights up in the interest of effective debate.\n\nNote that Crocker's Rules does not mean one is authorized to insult people; it\nmeans that other people don't have to worry about whether they are insulting\nyou. Crocker's Rules are a discipline, not a privilege. Furthermore, taking\nadvantage of Crocker's Rules does not imply reciprocity. How could it?\nCrocker's Rules are something you do for yourself, to maximize information\nreceived - not something you grit your teeth over and do as a favor.\n\n## Similar protocols (contrasted)\n\nIn contrast to radical honesty, Crocker's rules encourage being tactful with\nanyone who hasn't specifically accepted them. This follows the general\nprinciple of being \"liberal in what you accept and conservative in what you\nsend\".\n\nCrocker emphasized, repeatedly, in Wikipedia discourse and elsewhere, that one\ncould only adopt Crocker's rules to apply to oneself, and could not impose\nthem on a debate or forum with participants who had not opted-in explicitly to\nthese rules, nor use them to exclude any participant.\n\nA lack of freedom to make emotionally uncomfortable observations is often\nthought to lead to groupthink. The assertion that unanimity is not consensus\narises from common anecdotal evidence that disagreement is often not expressed\nnot because it is not relevant, but not pleasant, and that poor decisions are\noften unchallenged as a result. This principle is ancient, and dates back at\nleast to the ancient Hebrew Sanhedrin wherein unanimous decisions were\nconsidered unfair by nature and represented only the lack of adequate defense\nof the accused. A voluntary adoption of Crocker's rules would presumably\neliminate at least some cases of disagreeable silence and make more objections\nexplicit, as in the practice of appeals and supreme courts, where the minority\nopinion is codified with the same care as is taken with the majority's.\n\n## Blog posts\n\n  * Radical Honesty\n\n## External links\n\n  * Crocker's Rules \u2014 A note that originally introduced the concept.\n\n## See also\n\n  * Radical honesty\n  * Rational evidence\n  * Group rationality\n  * Offense\n  * Signaling\n\n", "frontpage": false}
