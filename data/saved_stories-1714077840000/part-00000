Police have charged the\nformer athletic director who they say faked the recording.\n\nBaltimore County Police arrested Pikesville High School\u2019s former athletic\ndirector Thursday morning and charged him with using artificial intelligence\nto impersonate Principal Eric Eiswert, leading the public to believe Eiswert\nmade racist and antisemitic comments behind closed doors.\n\nDazhon Darien, 31, was charged with disrupting school activities, after\ninvestigators determined Darien faked Eiswert\u2019s voice and circulated the audio\non social media in January, according to the Baltimore County State\u2019s\nAttorney\u2019s Office. Darien\u2019s nickname, DJ, was among the names mentioned in the\naudio clips he allegedly faked.\n\n\u201cThe audio clip ... had profound repercussions,\u201d police wrote in charging\ndocuments. \u201cIt not only led to Eiswert\u2019s temporary removal from the school but\nalso triggered a wave of hate-filled messages on social media and numerous\ncalls to the school. The recording also caused significant disruptions for the\nPHS staff and students.\u201d\n\nHe is also charged with theft and retaliating against a witness, related to\nalleged illicit payments he made to a school athletics coach, as well as\nstalking, prosecutors said.\n\nThe Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nBaltimore County Police Chief Robert McCullough, County Executive Johnny\nOlszewski, and School Superintendent Myriam Rogers announced a 1:30 pm press\nconference to discuss the case.\n\nEiswert\u2019s voice, which police and AI experts believe was simulated, made\ndisparaging comments toward Black students and the surrounding Jewish\ncommunity, was widely circulated on social media.\n\n### Read More\n\n### Baltimore County principal\u2019s racist comments faked by AI, experts say\n\nMar 26, 2024\n\n### Opinions vary over Pikesville principal as public debates recording\u2019s\nauthenticity\n\nJan 24, 2024\n\n### Baltimore County Public Schools investigates offensive recording alleged\nto be principal\n\nJan 22, 2024\n\nQuestions about the audio\u2019s authenticity quickly followed. Police wrote in\ncharging documents that Darien had accessed the school\u2019s network on multiple\noccasions in December and January searching for OpenAI tools, and used \u201cLarge\nLanguage Models\u201d that practice \u201cdeep learning, which involves pulling in vast\namounts of data from various sources on the internet, can recognize text\ninputted by the user, and produce conversational results.\u201d They also connected\nDarien to an email account that had distributed the recording.\n\nMany current and former students believed Eiswert was responsible for the\noffensive remarks, while former colleagues denounced the audio and defended\nEiswert\u2019s character. Eiswert himself has denied making those comments and said\nthe comments do not align with his views.\n\nThe audio, posted to the popular Instagram account murder_ink_bmore, prompted\na Baltimore County Public Schools and Baltimore County Police investigation.\nEiswert has not been working in the school since the investigation began.\n\nThe Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nThe voice refers to \u201cungrateful Black kids who can\u2019t test their way out of a\npaper bag\u201d and questions how hard it is to get those students to meet grade-\nlevel expectations. The speaker uses names of people who appear to be staff\nmembers and says they should not have been hired, and that he should get rid\nof another person \u201cone way or another.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if I have to get one more complaint from one more Jew in this community,\nI\u2019m going to join the other side,\u201d the voice said.\n\nDarien was being investigated as of December in a theft investigation that had\nbeen initiated by Eiswert. Police say Darien had authorized a $1,916 payment\nto the school\u2019s junior varsity basketball coach, who was also his roommate,\nunder the pretense that he was an assistant girls soccer coach. He was not,\nschool officials said. Eiswert determined that Darien had submitted the\npayment to the school payroll system, bypassing proper procedures. Darien had\nbeen notified of the investigation, police said.\n\nPolice say the clip was received by three teachers the night before it went\nviral. The first was Darien; a third said she received the email and then got\na call from Darien and teacher Shaena Ravenell telling her to check her email.\nRavenell told police that she had forwarded the email to a student\u2019s cell\nphone, \u201cwho she knew would rapidly spread the message around various social\nmedia outlets and throughout the school,\u201d and also sent it to the media and\nthe NAACP, police said.\n\nShe did not mention receiving it from Darien until confronted about his\ninvolvement. Ravenell has not been charged with a crime and could not\nimmediately be reached for comment.\n\nThe Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nBoth Darien and Ravenell have submitted their resignations to the school\nsystem, according to an April 16 school board document. The resignations are\ndated June 30.\n\nRogers, the superintendent, in January called the comments \u201cdisturbing\u201d and\n\u201chighly offensive and inappropriate statements about African American\nstudents, Pikesville High School staff, and Pikesville\u2019s Jewish community.\u201d\n\nBilly Burke, head of the Council of Administrative & Supervisory Employee, the\nunion that represents Eiswert, was the only official to suggest the audio was\nAI-generated.\n\nBurke said he was disappointed in the public\u2019s assumption of Eiswert\u2019s guilt.\nAt a January school board meeting, he said the principal needed police\npresence at his home because he and his family have been harassed and\nthreatened. Burke had also received harassing emails, he said at the time.\n\nPolice said the school\u2019s front desk staff was \u201cinundated with phone calls from\nparents and students expressing concern and disparaging remarks toward school\nstaff and administrators.\u201d The flood of calls made it difficult to field phone\ncalls from parents trying to make arrangements for their children and other\nschool functions, officials told police.\n\nThe Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\n\u201cThe school leadership expressed that staff did not feel safe, which required\nan increase in police presence at the school to address safety concerns and\nfears,\u201d police said.\n\nTeachers, under the impression the recording was authentic, \u201cexpressed fears\nthat recording devices could have been planted in various places in the\nschool,\u201d police said.\n\n\u201cThe recording\u2019s release deeply affected the trust between teachers and the\nadministration,\u201d police said. \u201cOne individual shared that they fielded\nsensitive phone calls in their vehicle in the parking lot instead of speaking\nin school.\u201d\n\nExperts in detecting audio and video fakes told The Banner in March that there\nwas overwhelming evidence the voice is AI-generated. They noted its flat tone,\nunusually clean background sounds and lack of consistent breathing sounds or\npauses as hallmarks of AI. They also ran the audio through several different\nAI-detection techniques, which consistently concluded it was a fake, though\nthey could not be 100% sure.\n\nAI voice-generation tools are now widely available online, and a single\nminute\u2019s recording of someone\u2019s voice can be enough to simulate it with a\n$5-a-month AI tool, the Nieman Journalism Lab reported in February.\n\nThere are few regulations to prevent AI imitations, called deepfakes, and few\nperpetrators are prosecuted.\n\n### RECOMMENDED FOR YOU\n\n### Maryland schools have a new superintendent.
