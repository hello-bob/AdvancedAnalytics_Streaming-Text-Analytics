But \u201cwokeness\u201d isn\u2019t the issue.\n\nBy Alicia Montgomery\n\nApril 16, 20241:23 PM\n\nAnimation by Slate\n\nTweet Share Share Comment\n\nTweet Share Share Comment\n\nNPR, the great bastion of old-school audio journalism, is a mess. But as\nsomeone who loves NPR, built my career there, and once aspired to stay\nforever, I say with sadness that it has been for a long time.\n\nThis might be news to those who tune out the circular firing squad of\ninstitutional media whiners. But my former NPR colleague Uri Berliner, one of\nthe organization\u2019s (as of now) senior editors, set off a firestorm by\npublishing a commentary that essentially blamed \u201cwokeness\u201d and Democratic\npartisanship for the apparent loss of confidence in the once-unimpeachable\ninstitution. (This morning, news broke that Uri has been suspended by NPR for\nviolating a policy about \u201coutside work,\u201d and informed that he\u2019d be fired for\nany more infractions.) The essay, published by Bari Weiss\u2019 the Free Press,\nblew up certain corners of X and various Facebook feeds, and was gleefully\nlapped up by conservatives who\u2019ve been fighting to defund NPR and public\nbroadcasting for a generation.\n\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\nIt was a longtime fear at NPR that some scandal or mess that the network had\nhoped to contain within its headquarters, lovingly referred to as the \u201cmother\nship\u201d by nippers and ex-nippers everywhere, would find its way to the outside\nworld, where the organization\u2019s very real, powerful enemies could exploit it.\nIn fact, this is happening right now; Christopher Rufo, a conservative writer\nand fellow at the Manhattan Institute, has launched a campaign against NPR\u2019s\nnew CEO Katherine Maher, accusing her of liberal bias based on old tweets.\nThose kinds of threats reinforce an in-the-trenches camaraderie at NPR. It has\nalso been used to quash internal criticism. I guess Uri\u2019s piece proves that\nthat strategy doesn\u2019t work anymore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUri started at NPR in 1999. I started in 1997 in the audience research\ndepartment as an administrative assistant. Because I was what we called \u201ca\nback-seat baby,\u201d someone who\u2019d grown up being force-fed a steady diet of NPR\nfrom car radios and in the home by crunchy granola parents, I had spent the\npast several months before my college graduation searching the organization\u2019s\nrudimentary website, desperate to find anything that I was qualified to do. A\nyear later, I maneuvered into the news division as the editorial assistant to\nsenior correspondent Daniel Schorr and one of the \u201cMurrow Boys,\u201d prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of\nCBS Radio legend and Good Night, and Good Luck hero Edward R. Murrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a stint at Salon from 1999 to 2001, I landed back at NPR. Everyone did.\nIt was an institutional joke that people who left for other jobs would find\ntheir way back, because the place was irresistible. And it kind of was. So\nmany people there were/are brilliant, kind, funny, interesting, and dedicated\nto public service. Aside from my family, I found most of the people I like,\nlove, and care about while I was working at NPR.\n\nSo when Uri\u2019s piece started popping up on my timeline last week, it felt like\nhearing a loud, ugly family argument break out in the room next door: I wanted\nto pretend as if it weren\u2019t happening; I wanted people to shut up. But if they\nwere going to shout, I at least wanted them to tell the whole story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that story is that NPR has been both a beacon of thoughtful, engaging, and\nfair journalism for decades, and a rickety organizational shit show for almost\nas long. If former CEO John Lansing\u2014the big bad of Uri\u2019s piece\u2014failed to fix\nit, or somehow made it worse, that\u2019s a failure he shared with almost every NPR\nleader before him. But if, as Uri charges (albeit in a negative way), Lansing\ngenuinely managed to break the network loose from the grasp of self-righteous\nwhite liberal identity politics, even in an imperfect way, that would surprise\nthe hell out of me. Especially given the well-reported exodus of top\njournalists of color, and the loss of a diverse group of journalists during\nlast year\u2019s podcast layoffs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt did take a kind of courage for Uri to publicly criticize the organization.\nBut it also took a lot of the wrong type of nerve. His argument is a\ndemonstration of contemporary journalism at its worst, in which inconvenient\nfacts and obvious questions were ignored, and the facts that could be shaped\nto serve the preferred argument were inflated in importance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTake a step into the way-back machine to 2011, Uri\u2019s so-called golden age.\nThat\u2019s the year when senior members of the development team fell for a scam\nset up by professional provocateur James O\u2019Keefe. The aftermath took them out\nand toppled then\u2013CEO and President Vivian Schiller. It came months after the\nill-timed, clumsy firing of Juan Williams, which led to senior vice president\nof news Ellen Weiss resigning under pressure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUri also leapfrogs over a long list of contemporary fuckups and questionable\ncalls that could explain the growing public distrust that concerns him. There\nwere questions about NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg\u2019s personal\nrelationship with Ruth Bader Ginsburg compromising her reporting; the\ndeparture of news chief Mike Oreskes, and other prominent men in the newsroom\u201a\nafter a wave of sexual harassment charges; the exposure of systematic\nexploitation of NPR\u2019s temporary workforce. And those are just the public\nproblems.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBehind the scenes and stretching back into the \u201cgolden age,\u201d there were major\nstrategic errors that seriously damaged the network\u2019s prospects. The founding\nproducer of The Daily at the New York Times was Theo Balcomb, a senior\nproducer at All Things Considered who couldn\u2019t get enough support to launch a\nmorning news podcast inside NPR. There was the \u201cFlat is the new growth\u201d mantra\nthat reigned for a few years after the network decided that a multimedia\nfuture meant shrugging off softness in listener numbers for core shows. Then\nthere was the time in the late aughts when leadership decided that podcasting\nwasn\u2019t going to amount to much, and so pumped the brakes on early efforts.\nThough the failure of imagination started earlier; the first big blunder I saw\nwas in the late 1990s, when the network failed to lock in a deal with a little\nshow called This American Life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUri\u2019s account of the deliberate effort to undermine Trump up to and after his\nelection is also bewilderingly incomplete, inaccurate, and skewed. For most of\n2016, many NPR journalists warned newsroom leadership that we weren\u2019t taking\nTrump and the possibility of his winning seriously enough. But top editors\ndismissed the chance of a Trump win repeatedly, declaring that Americans would\nbe revolted by this or that outrageous thing he\u2019d said or done. I remember one\neditorial meeting where a white newsroom leader said that Trump\u2019s strong poll\nnumbers wouldn\u2019t survive his being exposed as a racist. When a journalist of\ncolor asked whether his numbers could be rising because of his racism, the\ncomment was met with silence. In another meeting, I and a couple of other\neditorial leaders were encouraged to make sure that any coverage of a Trump\nlie was matched with a story about a lie from Hillary Clinton. Another\ncolleague asked what to do if one candidate just lied more than the other.\nAnother silent response.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI left NPR in the early fall of 2016, but when I came back to work on Morning\nEdition about a year later, I saw NO trace of the anti-Trump editorial machine\nthat Uri references. On the contrary, people were at pains to find a way to\ncover Trump\u2019s voters and his administration fairly. We went full-bore on\n\u201cdiner guy in a trucker hat\u201d coverage and adopted the \u201calt-right\u201d label to\ndescribe people who could accurately be called racists. The network had a\nreflexive need to stay on good terms with people in power, and journalists who\nhad contacts within the administration were encouraged to pursue those\nbookings.\n\nWe regularly set up live interviews with Republican officials and Trump\nsurrogates. But it was tough because NPR always loved guests who would be\ninsightful, honest, and\u2014perhaps above all\u2014polite. There were plenty of people\nwho\u2019d for years fit that description across the partisan divide in official\nWashington, but they were scarce in the Trump administration. We changed the\nformat of live political interviews, adding what we called a \u201clevel-set.\u201d That\nwould be three-ish minutes after a conversation with a political operative or\nelected official when a host and NPR reporter would try to fact-check what had\njust been said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe the biggest head-scratcher for me in Uri\u2019s argument is how it frames the\nlack of pursuit of the Hunter Biden laptop story as driven exclusively by\npolitics. Uri said there was no follow-through because \u201cthe timeless\njournalistic instinct of following a hot story lead was being squelched.\u201d In\nfairness, I left NPR for good in the spring of 2020, so I wasn\u2019t there for\nthis story arc. And the inappropriate statement, from a loose-lipped editor,\nthat \u201cit was good we weren\u2019t following the laptop story because it could help\nTrump\u201d sounds on-brand. But that killer instinct was regularly beat out of NPR\njournalists, regardless of the political mood or the president.\n\nPeople pitched good stories in our meetings all the time that were dismissed\nas insubstantial, or not interesting, or not important enough, only for them\nto appear days or weeks later in the New York Times or the Washington Post.\nAnd only then, NPR leaders would want reporters to jump on it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were several reasons why good pitches died. The pitcher wasn\u2019t high\nenough in the editorial landscape to be taken seriously. The resources were\nscarce because we were top-heavy and spread thin, trying to cover the country\nand the world, far beyond electoral politics. We didn\u2019t have enough reporters\nor the right reporters on whatever beat to cover the story properly.\nCorrespondents, reporters, and desks could be very territorial, and if this\none specific reporter wasn\u2019t able to do a story\u2014because they were covering\nsomething else, or on leave, or didn\u2019t feel like it\u2014the piece frequently died.\nIf reporting on an issue or story had already been done by an NPR reporter, a\npitch could get smothered. That\u2019s even if the original story had been years\nago and the facts had changed, because pursuing an update of an old story was\nfrequently framed as some kind of insult to the reporter who\u2019d done it before.\nMany sharp ideas just hit a wall of silence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd to be fair, some of that did seem politically motivated, before and after\nTrump was elected. I remember resistance to covering the violent MS-13 gang\nafter it became a major talking point in Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric\u2014even\nthough the gang was active and murdering people in communities around the D.C.\nmetropolitan area, close to NPR\u2019s headquarters, and just miles from where many\nstaffers lived. I think a lot of critics would consider that \u201cwokeness\u201d:\npussyfooting around an issue because it might offend people of color. I saw it\nas low-key racial bias, because MS-13\u2019s victims were mostly poor Central\nAmerican immigrants, the kind of people we didn\u2019t think our affluent white\nlistenership would pay attention to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRace has long been one of those third-rail issues in NPR\u2019s coverage. I was\npart of the Code Switch team, beginning in August 2014, around the time that\nMichael Brown was killed in Ferguson. The Code Switch unit had been birthed in\none of those fits of diversity enthusiasm that have dotted the organization\u2019s\ntimeline from my first years there. The unit started in 2013, in the age of\nObama, and focused mainly on blogging about race and the intersection with\nculture. But that changed when the network shut down Tell Me More with Michel\nMartin, a show that made covering race a priority, and one that I worked on\nfrom its first weeks until the bitter end. Code Switch stepped into the gap,\nwith strong but soul-crushing coverage of police brutality, racist violence,\nprotests, and civil unrest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNPR did excellent work in covering those stories, including Michel\u2014who is a\nmentor and dear friend to me\u2014leading a community forum from Missouri, and\ngreat investigative reporting on a culture of corruption in Ferguson that led\nto overpolicing of Black residents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome listeners rightly pointed out that police killed white people too, and\noften under shady circumstances. When I suggested that we pursue it as a\nstory, I got crickets. When video emerged of a cop shooting white teenager\nZachary Hammond during a drug sting operation, I couldn\u2019t get our leadership\nto green-light reporting on it. Code Switch was the only unit that went to air\nwith something on Hammond\u2019s death. I think that\u2019s because it would have\ncomplicated\u2014or acknowledged the complication\u2014of a story where we could smugly\nposition ourselves as on the \u201cright\u201d side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that\u2019s what the core editorial problem at NPR is and, frankly, has long\nbeen: an abundance of caution that often crossed the border to cowardice. NPR\nculture encouraged an editorial fixation on finding the exact middle point of\nthe elite political and social thought, planting a flag there, and calling it\nobjectivity. That would more than explain the lack of follow-up on Hunter\nBiden\u2019s laptop and the lab-leak theory, going full white guilt after George\nFloyd\u2019s murder, and shifting to indignant white impatience with racial justice\nnow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLayers of complex relationships made genuine editorial criticism hazardous at\nNPR. Even in an industry in which office romances happen a lot, NPR has been\nexceptional, boasting dozens of \u201cmet and married\u201d couples. And that doesn\u2019t\ncover all the quiet couples, besties, and other personal entanglements. All\nthis means that if you criticized someone\u2019s editorial decisions in a meeting,\ntheir best friend, sweetheart, or ex might be glowering at you from across the\ntable. Even a mild critique could be met with: You know John\u2019s been having a\nhard time because his dad just died/wife just left him/kid is having problems.\nGive him a break. Lots of people who were in relationships with colleagues\nkept it out of their work, but enough did not that it contributed to a culture\nwhere whisper networks replaced open discussion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven all that, I have to acknowledge that I understand how Uri could\u2019ve been\nhonestly mistaken in reaching some of his conclusions. Another chronic\norganizational struggle at NPR is stove-piping. Your experience could be\ncompletely different from that of someone working right across the hall from\nyou, depending on the team you worked with and the meetings you went to. I was\nlucky, and (mostly) played my cards right during my years there. I landed with\ngreat groups of journalists who nurtured my talents and helped me address my\nflaws. I loved the place and for years defended it from charges of bias, even\nwhen my friends were victims of it. I completely bought the \u201cbad apples\u201d\nversion of NPR\u2019s long-standing issues with racism and sexism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI leaned on the positive, and the belief that NPR was great and could be\nbetter. So I was a part of a lot of the \u201cLet\u2019s make this diversity thing work\u201d\nefforts that rankled Uri. I remember leading one session he attended, when he\nspoke out to insist that NPR\u2019s diversity problem had a lot to do with issues\nbeyond race, like class, region, education, and political perspective. He was\nright, and I told him so.\n\nBut maybe the stove-piping meant that Uri didn\u2019t see the pattern in those\nefforts that started wearing my spirit down. Some big news in the world or an\ninternal failure would spark a wave of carefully stage-managed soul-searching\nfrom leadership, and ad hoc committees of well-intentioned volunteers would be\nassembled to write lists of recommendations. Then those recommendations would\nbe politely received, filed away, and forgotten. And two or three years later,\nsome new crisis would start the cycle all over again. In my experience, those\nmultihyphenate identity groups or task forces were disproportionately full of\njunior staffers. Because many veterans\u2014except for true-believing tryhards like\nme\u2014understood that they were a waste of time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Related From Slate\n\n#### Joel Anderson\n\n### The Key Detail Missing From the Narrative About O.J. and Race\n\nRead More\n\nOne of the moments that sealed my decision to leave NPR was a conversation\nwith my colleague and friend Keith Woods, NPR\u2019s chief diversity officer. I was\nstruck by a profound sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, not just about the stubborn challenge\nof diversifying NPR\u2019s coverage. I felt that he and I were repeating\u2014word for\nword, beat for beat\u2014a discussion about source diversity that we\u2019d had in the\nexact same room years before.\n\nBy that time, my rose-colored glasses and NPR-fueled sense of my own superior\npowers of understanding had already taken a severe beating. I had thought\nhighly of all the men who were later felled by the sexual harassment scandal\nand had unwittingly recommended some of them as mentors to young journalists.\nI discovered that Mike Oreskes\u2014someone whom I trusted and who was critical in\nhelping me get back into NPR in 2017\u2014had even harassed one of the women I\nencouraged to seek him out for career advice. I was stunned in the management-\nlevel meetings and conversations where harassment victims were disparaged as\ntroublemakers, and harassers who were still with the company were protected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI so loved the version of NPR that I had experienced and had amplified in my\nimagination that I was slow to see the cruelty being done to people I worked\nwith and cared about. Because of my reputation in the system, I had become a\nmagnet for young public radio journalists across the country who wanted to\nshare their stories of being sexually or racially harassed, underpaid, or\nbullied, and ask for my advice. I lost track of how many of these calls I got,\nor how many discreet coffeehouse chats revealed a new story of abuse. I\nremember at least three people who told me some version of \u201cIt\u2019s OK. I don\u2019t\nthink about killing myself anymore.\u201d For what it\u2019s worth, two of those were\nyoung white journalists. When I reached out to talk with a wise NPR connected\nelder about it, her advice was to stop taking those calls. Pretend that I\ndidn\u2019t know the facts, because they challenged the narrative about who we\nwere, and how my hubris had contributed to it.\n\nI guess that\u2019s why I think Uri is most wrong about NPR\u2019s relationship with the\nrest of the country. It\u2019s a very accurate reflection of America right now, a\nplace where people won\u2019t admit that good intentions don\u2019t always yield good\nresults, and would rather hide behind the myth of its excellence than do the\nhard work of making it a reality. I sincerely hope there\u2019s still time to turn\nit around.\n\nTweet Share Share Comment\n\n  * Journalism\n  * Media\n  * Race\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### About\n\n  * About Us\n  * Work With Us\n  * Contact\n  * Pitch Guidelines\n  * Send Us Tips\n  * Corrections\n  * Commenting\n  * Reprints\n\n#### Subscriptions\n\n  * Subscribe\n  * Sign In\n  * Account\n  * Subscription FAQs\n  * Podcast FAQs\n  * Newsletters\n  * Customer Support\n\n#### Advertising\n\n  * AdChoices\n  * Cookie Preferences\n\nSlate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\n#### Follow Us\n\nFacebook Twitter Instagram YouTube RSS Feed\n\n  * User Agreement\n  * Privacy Policy\n\nAll contents \u00a9 2024 The Slate Group LLC.
