Its ethical,\neconomic, and social implications continue to be debated, and its potential\napplications within companies have become a subject of much discussion. As\nbusinesses explore AI\u2019s capabilities, they must also consider the challenges\nand opportunities it presents, including its impact on society.\n\nIT professionals are eagerly embracing the opportunity to lead AI adoption in\ntheir business operations. The potential benefits, whether real or perceived,\nare a welcome addition to the institutional narrative, further fueling their\nenthusiasm. Though not statistically significant, a quick look at LinkedIn can\nprovide an idea of this trend.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to underscore that AI is not just another technology to add to\nan organization\u2019s arsenal. Its adoption necessitates a pragmatic approach,\nwith clear goals, detailed strategic planning, and a comprehensive\nunderstanding of its potential and limitations.\n\nFurthermore, assessing the long-term commitment required to develop AI-based\nsolutions and the real economic sustainability of related investments over\ntime is necessary. Lastly, the most relevant issue is that the integration of\nAI into companies, like any technology, should be driven by goals aimed at\nsolving concrete problems. Many IT managers overlook this trivial premise, and\nthe implications that derive from the obsessive desire for innovation at any\ncost turn sustained investments into sunk costs.\n\n## Beyond the Hype\n\nAI is not just a passing trend, but a transformative force that will\ninevitably impact us all. Unlike other technologies that may have faded,\nartificial intelligence is here to stay, reshaping the world as we know it. In\nrecent years, only blockchain has generated enthusiasm comparable to AI.\nHowever, the most optimistic forecasts have often proven exaggerated, and many\nblockchain startups are still striving to scale and maintain their market\nimpact.\n\nAlthough there are significant use cases in this area (such as the De Beers\nGroup), the costs and complexities involved have led to widespread, if not\ndisappointing, results on a large scale. On this topic, I invite you to read\nthe article The Truth about Blockchain, published in the Harvard Business\nReview in January 2017, for further insights. There has indeed been recent\ndiscussion about the potential of blockchain in ensuring the security and\naccuracy of AI algorithms. However, its actual applicability and convenience\nstill need to be demonstrated.\n\nIn the context of AI, especially in service companies, some IT managers\nconsider it only as a tool to increase business productivity, neglecting its\ncritical applications such as data management, trend forecasting, process\noptimization, and creating new business models. AI-based virtual assistants\nhave become the obvious first solution proposed by everyone. However, limiting\nthe discussion on AI to this level is reductive, primarily because such tools\nrepresent only some of the answers to the problems they promise to solve.\n\nTake ChatGPT, for example, an advanced virtual assistant that demonstrates the\npotential of AI in programming and natural language processing. Despite its\nremarkable progress, ChatGPT is still subject to significant errors. It is\nessential to understand that these systems could be better and that the user\nmust still have knowledge of the topics they seek assistance with.\n\nSure! Here\u2019s a more concise explanation of the solution:\n\nTo solve :\n\n  * Isolate one of the square roots: .\n  * Square both sides: .\n  * Move all terms with square roots to one side: .\n  * Simplify by dividing both sides by 2: .\n  * Square both sides again: .\n  * Solve for : .\n  * Substituting into the original equation confirms its validity.\n\nTherefore, the only real solution is:\n\nThis solution is wrong. I won\u2019t go into the calculations\u2019 details, but the\nequation\u2019s correct result is .\n\nWhen I pointed this out, the ChatGPT responded as follows:\n\n> My apologies for the oversight. Let\u2019s correct the solution. The only real\n> solution is .\n\nWolframAlpha\u2019s solver, on the other hand, was more accurate, correctly\nanswering the initial query.\n\nDespite the uncertainties, generative text tools like ChatGPT are formidable\nfor many tasks, such as coding in various languages. The returned code is\nalmost always functional, if not optimal. However, it provides a starting\npoint, drastically reducing development time and the frustration of developers\nfacing doubts or new problems to solve. However, these are palliative\nsolutions and do not represent a disruptive AI-based technology capable of\nprofoundly altering the organizational fabric of companies.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nIt is more than a certainty that AI is here to stay and will profoundly impact\nall industrial sectors. However, it is equally plausible to believe that many\nof its applications in companies, especially in these initial hype stages,\nwill quickly be forgotten.\n\n  * I recommend reading The Age of AI by Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher, September 2021. It offers a clear and forward-thinking vision of AI\u2019s future scenarios.\n  * The Age of AI has begun, by Bill Gates, March 2023.\n\nA weekly dose of insights, analysis, and curated content for STEM students and\nexperts.\n\nMONDAY @ 10:00 AM\n\nAntonio Lupetti\n\nMath, code, NLP and data\n\nWhat's new?\n\nLife is an unknown\n\nTheory\n\nPractice\n\nGlossary\n\nImprove this site\n\nRSS Feeds\n\nA weekly dose of insights, analysis, and curated content for STEM students and\nexperts.\n\nMONDAY @ 10:00 AM\n\nRead Now\n\nExternal Resources\n\nAmerican Mathematical SocietyMIT Math OpenCourseWareMathWorldNew\nScientistPhys.orgQuanta MagazineScienceDailyStack Exchange MathWolfram\nMathWorld\n\nAlgebrica.org offers easy-to-follow guides on algebra, geometry, and calculus.\nOur aim is to make math accessible and understandable for all students, from\nbeginners to advanced learners.\n\nBrowse\n\nWhat's New?
