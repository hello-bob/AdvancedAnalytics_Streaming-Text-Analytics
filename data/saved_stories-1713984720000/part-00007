The project she\ndesigned asked students to read Dickinson\u2019s correspondence and compare them to\nher art, finding examples of how one led to the other. Dickinson\u2019s letters are\navailable for free through The Internet Archive, a nonprofit, digital library\nthat has, among other content, 44 million digitized books and texts at\narchive.org.\n\nDigital Book Banning\n\n### Schools Were Just Supposed To Block Porn. Instead They Sabotaged Homework\nand Censored Suicide Prevention Sites\n\nThe Trevor Project? Blocked. Planned Parenthood? Blocked. NASA? BLOCKED\n\nApril 13, 2024 06:00 ET\n\nBut Tyree and her students couldn\u2019t get to them. Archive.org is blocked by\ntheir school district. The federal government effectively mandated web filters\nfor schools in 2000 through the Children\u2019s Internet Protection Act. At the\ntime, filters were seen as an important way to keep kids from accessing online\nporn. A Markup investigation published earlier this month, however, showed\nthese filters have morphed into tools of digital censorship, keeping students\nin some districts from abortion information, sex ed, and LGBTQ+ resources,\nincluding suicide prevention.\n\nAfter our investigation published, teachers\u2014including Tyree\u2014took to social\nmedia to point out how the web filters frustrate them, too.\n\nTyree has been in classrooms for 16 years, teaching students of all ages a mix\nof English, writing, science, and music. Because the federal government only\nrequires districts to keep students from obscene and harmful content and\notherwise leaves them to block whatever else they want, Tyree has had\ndifferent problems from one district to another. Sometimes tech support will\nunblock websites she asks to be unblocked, but her request to get her students\naccess to Archive.org was recently denied over a concern that the website also\nhosts adult content.\n\n\u201cIt was the only place online that we could get access to Emily Dickinson\u2019s\ncorrespondence for free,\u201d Tyree said. \u201cWe had to change the entire project.\u201d\n\n> We had to change the entire project.\n>\n> Elizabeth Tyree, a teacher in West Texas\n\nKaitlyn D\u2019Annibale, an athletic trainer in Washington, D.C. who works with\nhigh school athletes, has run into similar hurdles. She needs access to the\nhealthcare website MedBridge both for continuing education and to create home\nexercise programs for the students she works with, but the site is blocked by\nher school.\n\n\u201cThey pay for the membership, but I can\u2019t access the site,\u201d D\u2019Annibale said.\n\nWhen she needs to review hospital MRIs to assess students\u2019 playing capacity,\nshe can\u2019t go through the hospital portal to open them because such portals are\nblocked. Her workaround? Wait until she gets home to look on her own computer.\n\nShe recently wanted to look up suicide prevention resources for a student.\n\u201cAnything I put into Google that was \u2018suicidal\u2019 anything got blocked,\u201d\nD\u2019Annibale said. Eventually she made it to a useful PDF by getting creative\nwith the wording of her search terms.\n\n## Report Deeply and Fix Things\n\nBecause it turns out moving fast and breaking things broke some super\nimportant things.\n\nGive Now\n\nD\u2019Annibale said she has asked for sites to be unblocked in the past but the\nprocess is tedious and resolution is short-lived. Sites that the IT department\nhas unblocked for her have reverted to being blocked. She hasn\u2019t been able to\nfigure out why.\n\nOne commenter on TikTok said that the process for requesting sites be\nunblocked in her district requires her to do research about the blocked site\n(at home, where she can access it), make a case to an administrator, answer\nfollow-up questions, wait for that person to take the request to a board for\napproval, and then answer more follow-up questions before a decision can be\nmade.\n\nAnother described a similar situation: \u201cMy district has sites blocked that are\nactually in the curriculum. We\u2019re supposed to contact our district\n[department] heads to ask them to get it unblocked. Like they don\u2019t have\nenough to do. It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\n\nOther teachers told The Markup about how hard it can be to make lesson plans\nfor substitute teachers, because they aren\u2019t sure which of the sites that are\navailable to them are actually blocked to subs and students. They described\nindiscriminate blocks to YouTube, Pinterest, and Wikipedia\u2014sites that have\nuseful educational resources mixed in with other content.\n\n> My district has sites blocked that are actually in the curriculum.\n>\n> Teacher commenting on TikTok\n\nNancy Willard saw this all coming.\n\nBack in 2000, Willard worked at the Center for Advanced Technology in\nEducation at the University of Oregon and submitted testimony to the\nChildren\u2019s Internet Safety Committee, urging Congress not to require filters\nin the Children\u2019s Internet Protection Act. Reached by phone this week, Willard\ncalled the filters a \u201ctechnical, quick-fix solution\u201d that either don\u2019t\nwork\u2014because students find ways around them\u2014or leave kids unprepared for the\nreal world.\n\n\u201cTheir world doesn\u2019t have filtering software on their computers at home and\ntheir world as adults isn\u2019t going to have filtering software,\u201d Willard said.\n\u201cSo if they haven\u2019t developed the self-control, the ability to assess\ncredibility of information, the ability to focus on the task at hand and not\ngo play [online games], if they haven\u2019t developed that ability, how effective\nare they going to be as adults?\u201d\n\nWillard\u2019s insistence that schools teach students about safe internet use made\nit into the law. Of course, much to her dismay and the continued frustration\nof teachers all over the country, the filtering requirement did, too.\n\nYour donations power our award-winning reporting and our tools.
