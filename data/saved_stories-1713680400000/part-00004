But generally speaking these are\noutdated pieces of advice from a different era. I\u2019ve written before about how\ntechnology changes and those idioms are prime examples: back before the\nnearly-ubiquitous adoption of TLS, public WiFi presented considerably more\nrisks. But the times have changed and that advice is no longer applicable. So\non that note: let\u2019s talk about antivirus.\n\nIf you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ve had more than your fair share of Windows computers\nthat come bloated with all kinds of crap you didn\u2019t ask for and will\nabsolutely never use \u2013 I\u2019m looking at you, OneDrive and Candy Crush. Antivirus\nis a frequent offender. Sometimes it\u2019s AVG, sometimes it\u2019s McAfee, sometimes\nit's someone else, but there\u2019s always a universal constant: nobody really uses\nit. Even if you do believe in antivirus, there\u2019s almost always a different\nservice you\u2019d rather use so the defaults end up just sitting there, cluttering\nup your device and swindling the less tech savvy out of their money for an \u2013\nat best \u2013 inferior product.\n\nThe more I think about those dark days, the more I realize how much antivirus\nseems to be one of those outdated zombies. I never see YouTubers shilling\nantivirus, and the only time I see it pop up online is when people are making\nmemes about it. In fact, I\u2019m fairly sure we did use some of those inferior\nproducts back when I was in high school on the family computer and I\u2019m pretty\nsure that still never stopped me from putting viruses on there like crazy\nbecause I was a stupid teenager who didn\u2019t know how to be safe online. I also\nnever read any stories about ransomware or hacks that could\u2019ve been prevented\nif only the company in question had updated their Norton subscription. So that\nbegs the question: is antivirus even relevant anymore?\n\nVeteran readers already know my stance on this. My answer is \u201cno, I don\u2019t\nthink you really need antivirus anymore.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of reasons I feel this\nway. For starters, modern security measures taken by manufacturers have come a\nvery long way. Macs, for example, are notoriously secure, so much so that\nthere\u2019s a misconception that you can\u2019t get malware on a Mac. That\u2019s not true,\nbut it is quite rare because of the immense number and quality of security\nmeasures that are baked into modern Mac devices. Windows has long trailed\nbehind on security but has been making strides in recent years. The built-in\nWindows defense tool \u2013 appropriately called Windows Defender \u2013 has gone from\nbeing virtually useless to pretty robust and experts agree that it\u2019s adequate\nfor most users. Additionally, Windows 11 has made huge improvements in the\nsecurity department and has learned from many of the mistakes that made past\nWindows editions the butt of many security jokes. That\u2019s to say nothing of\nmobile devices, which have especially avoided many of the shortcomings of\ncomputers. Most mobile devices are incredibly hard to infect, instead having\nto resort to tricking users into downloading a malicious app. Even if\ninfected, the vast majority of such malware can be easily removed by simply\nremoving said app and rebooting the phone.\n\nI also pointed to the news and the existing landscape as further evidence. As\nI said before, I have never once read a story that said that a company was\ncompromised because they didn\u2019t renew their antivirus subscription. The\nclosest I\u2019ve seen is companies who fail to update their software, but that can\nhappen regardless of what the software is or how current the license is.\nInstead, the vast majority of compromises occur through phishing, social\nengineering, and other methods that convince the targeted user to hand over\ntheir own credentials or download malicious software or otherwise convince the\ntarget to somehow give the attacker access. If I convinced you to unlock your\ndoor and then I forced my way inside the house, that\u2019s hardly the same as\narguing that the door (or walls or windows) failed or that you should\u2019ve\nrenewed your ADT subscription. That\u2019s basically what happens most of the time.\n\nNow, in the interest of fairness, cybersecurity is a complex topic and this is\nno exception. I stated earlier that sometimes outdated \u201cbest practices\u201d like\nthe dangers of public WiFi and commonly rotating passwords do have some\nexceptions, and antivirus is no different. For starters, if you\u2019re already\ninfected, antivirus may be the best (or only) way to find and remove the\ninfection. Additionally, if you\u2019re in a high risk situation \u2013 being a public\nfigure who gets targeted often or your work requires you to frequently\ndownload files \u2013 then I could see the value there. But for the average user\nwho sticks to the same handful of trusted sites and programs, I don\u2019t think\nthey have much to gain from antivirus. Readers considering antivirus software\nshould also be aware that such software \u2013 ironically \u2013 presents a risk just by\nits very nature. Antivirus software has to have full access to every part of\nyour system so it can scan and remove things. Should the software become\ncompromised, it can become the entry point to allow full access into every\nsensitive part of your device \u2013 and we\u2019ve already seen at least one instance\nof antivirus companies abusing this kind of access by selling user data to\nadvertisers. There are some niche cases where I could see the value of\nantivirus, but I would caution users to remember that these are powerful\nprograms with a lot of privileged access. Don\u2019t make that decision lightly.\n\nSo for the average user who (according to me) doesn\u2019t need antivirus, what do\nI recommend instead?\n\n  1. Keep everything updated. Make sure you enable automatic updates wherever possible, and keep everything updated \u2013 not just the device itself but the apps, too.\n\n  2. Remove things you don\u2019t need. If there are programs you don\u2019t use on your device \u2013 whether bloatware that came with it or stuff you simply stopped using \u2013 be sure to remove them. Every app and program could have a vulnerability in it, and as soon as cybercriminals find that vulnerability you\u2019re now at risk. Keeping things updated helps, but if it\u2019s a program you don\u2019t use then the better solution is to simply remove it. They can\u2019t exploit something that was never on your device to begin with.\n\n  3. Use wisely. As I said earlier, the top two ways I see people get malware is by not updating (which I addressed first) or by getting phished in some way. Even as an individual, this remains true. Unless you\u2019re in some sort of high-value role (like being a CEO or working on an important government project) most of these efforts will usually be relatively easy to spot and avoid. This means implementing practices in your life like only using trusted, official websites for online purchases or downloading software and not downloading attachments or clicking links in email unless you were expecting it and verified that it is indeed legitimate. Of course, even official, reputable sites can sometimes be compromised, so for maximum protection I of course recommend checking out some of the pages on my website, but doing some basic due diligence will, in most situations, protect you from the lowest of low-hanging fruit.\n\n  4. If you must... If you\u2019ve read all this and still decided that antivirus software is right for you, be sure to pick one wisely. Objective-See is a non-profit who specializes in open source security software for Mac devices, and iVerify is my recommendation for iPhones. For Android, the Divested Computing Group (the makers of DivestOS) have released Hypatia, a malware scanner which has since been added by default to CalyxOS. For Windows there\u2019s no clear winner I\u2019ve been made aware of from a highly trusted organization, however Malwarebytes offers a free tool that will scan and remove malware for you on demand (but not 24/7 in realtime).. If you\u2019re a Linux user, really the only option is Clam AV, which is unfortunately extremely limited compared to some of the more robust offerings on other devices, but there are a number of other actions Linux users can take to help defend their system on top of this.\n\nAgain, to be clear, I\u2019m only listing recommendations for people who would\nprefer to have antivirus, but remember that there are a number of other\nfactors \u2013 both things you control (like your habits and actions) and things\nbehind-the-scenes (like your device\u2019s built-in security measures) \u2013 that are\nalready helping to protect you (in my opinion) more effectively. For the vast\nmajority of users, I believe that antivirus is no longer a \u201cmust have\u201d tool.\nAntivirus software is a lot like VPNs: there\u2019s a lot of shady companies out\nthere exaggerating the risks and benefits to line their pockets. While they do\noffer additional protection, for most users you can save the money and protect\nyourself just as well with a few basic best practices. Whatever you decide is\nright for you, I hope this post has been helpful in making that decision.\n\nYou can find more recommended services and programs at TheNewOil.org, and you\ncan find our other content across the web here or support our work in a\nvariety of ways here.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
