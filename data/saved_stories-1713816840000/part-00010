Credit: J\u00e9r\u00e9my Fonvielle/University of\nCambridge\n\nFor decades, scientists have studied freshwater ecosystems using indicators\nsuch as pH, temperature, salinity, and nutrient content.\n\n> \u201cThis untapped measure in nature can give us a lot of really useful\n> information.\u201d\n\nBut a new paper published in Science argues that chemical diversity\n(chemodiversity) could be a way to better gauge and analyze freshwater\necosystem health. The paper encourages ecologists to use high-resolution mass\nspectrometry to uncover the characteristics of dissolved organic matter, or\nDOM.\n\n\u201cThis untapped measure in nature can give us a lot of really useful\ninformation,\u201d said Andrew Tanentzap, an ecologist at Trent University in\nPeterborough, Ont., Canada, and a coauthor on the new paper.\n\n### DOMinating Ecosystem Functions\n\nMeasuring chemodiversity hinges on understanding DOM, a group of carbon-\ncontaining compounds ubiquitous in nature.\n\n## This newsletter rocks.\n\nGet the most fascinating science news stories of the week in your inbox every\nFriday.\n\nSign up now\n\nDifferent types of DOM play important roles in freshwater systems. Some block\nlight from passing through water, which affects how plants and algae grow as\nwell as water temperature. Others bind to toxic compounds, making them either\nmore or less available for other freshwater organisms to consume or absorb.\nWhen bound to DOM, nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus are more\nbioavailable and can promote the growth of harmful algae that impair water\nquality.\n\n\u201cUntil now, we\u2019ve really treated dissolved organic matter like it\u2019s kind of a\nblack box,\u201d Tanentzap said. Scientists typically measure the concentration of\nDOM in water samples and can get some idea of its bulk makeup. But identifying\nthe specific characteristics of DOM requires high-resolution mass\nspectrometry, which shows scientists the molecular composition of individual\ncompounds.\n\nThe method has gone underused in biology and ecology, said Krista Longnecker,\na marine chemist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who was not\ninvolved in the research. It wasn\u2019t until recent decades that mass\nspectrometers evolved enough to allow scientists to identify different types\nof molecules within an ecosystem, she said.\n\n\u201cPeople for years have said, \u2018Okay, let\u2019s look at the biodiversity, let\u2019s look\nat the biology,\u2019\u201d Longnecker said. \u201cBut that\u2019s only half the story. The other\nhalf is what the chemicals and molecules are doing.\u201d\n\n### Pinning Down Pollution\n\nThe paper hypothesizes that greater chemodiversity leads to greater\nbiodiversity and a healthier ecosystem. That makes sense, said Juliana\nD\u2019Andrilli, an environmental chemist at the University of North Texas who\npeer-reviewed the paper: Like humans, she said, microbes are happier when\nthere\u2019s a wide array of chemicals available to them to metabolize. And in\ngeneral, healthier microbe populations lead to healthier ecosystems.\n\n> \u201cBy using the molecular characteristics of the organic matter, you can work\n> out its origins.\u201d\n\nHigh-resolution mass spectrometry can also help ecologists identify the\nsources of freshwater pollution from DOM because DOM from one source may have\na slightly different makeup than DOM from another source. \u201cMass spectrometry\nis almost like a fingerprinting technique,\u201d Tanentzap said. \u201cBy using the\nmolecular characteristics of the organic matter, you can work out its\norigins.\u201d\n\nFor example, a previous study by Longnecker and other researchers used high-\nresolution mass spectrometry to determine that phosphorus pollution in Lake\nErie originated from agricultural fields and wastewater treatment plants.\n\nApplying high-resolution mass spectrometry to questions of ecosystem health is\nespecially important as aquatic ecosystems undergo rapid changes brought on by\nhuman influence and climate change, Longnecker said.\n\nA lack of cross-disciplinary understanding has delayed this type of research,\nTanentzap said. Chemists aren\u2019t generally interested in the ecological\nfunctions of DOM, and biologists often aren\u2019t familiar with the techniques\nused to identify them, he added. Getting biologists and chemists on the same\npage could accelerate the kind of research he hopes will come out of the new\npaper.\n\nHolding workshops to unify language across disciplines, training researchers\nto improve their science communication skills, and cultivating enthusiasm for\ncross-disciplinary work are all ways to encourage the conversations necessary\nfor the new paper\u2019s ideas to become reality, according to D\u2019Andrilli.\n\n\u2014Grace van Deelen (@GVD__), Staff Writer\n\n##### Citation: van Deelen, G.
