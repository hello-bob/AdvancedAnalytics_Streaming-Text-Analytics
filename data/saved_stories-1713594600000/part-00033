However, possible\necosystem impacts from the strategic design of hypothetical intervention\nscenarios are poorly understood. Two recent Earth system model simulations\ndepict policy-relevant stratospheric aerosol injection scenarios with similar\nglobal temperature targets, but a 10-year delay in intervention deployment.\nHere we show this delay leads to distinct ecological risk profiles through\nclimate speeds, which describe the rate of movement of thermal conditions. On\na planetary scale, climate speeds in the simulation where the intervention\nmaintains temperature are not statistically distinguishable from preindustrial\nconditions. In contrast, rapid temperature reduction following delayed\ndeployment produces climate speeds over land beyond either a preindustrial\nbaseline or no-intervention climate change with present policy. The area\nexposed to threshold climate speeds places different scenarios in context to\ntheir relative ecological risks. Our results support discussion of tradeoffs\nand timescales in future scenario design and decision-making.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Climate intervention on a high-emissions pathway could delay but not\nprevent West Antarctic Ice Sheet demise\n\nArticle Open access 10 August 2023\n\nJ.

Smith\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe imprint of anthropogenic climate change is clear in ecosystems worldwide,\nwith worsening impacts expected under all future emissions\npathways^1,2,3,4,5,6,7. High-impact risks such as these motivate the study of\npotential climate intervention methods to reduce climate impacts as efforts to\ndecarbonize continue^8,9. Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) is a\nhypothetical method to limit warming or cool the planet by adding reflective\nparticles to the stratosphere^8. Many different potential SAI deployment\nscenarios could complement emissions reductions. For example, SAI could be\nused to maintain global temperatures at or below some critical threshold or to\nrapidly reduce temperatures^8,9,10,11,12. In contrast to carbon dioxide\nremoval interventions, which operate on slower timescales^13, solar radiation\nmanagement methods such as SAI currently represent the only known method to\nquickly alter global mean temperatures with near-future technology^8,9.\n\nSpecies habituated to environmental niches must shift their range, adapt, or\nbe extirpated as ambient conditions shift geographically in a changing\nclimate^14,15. The climate velocity of 2-meter temperature expresses the\nmovement of thermal conditions and can be used to address the question: How\nfast, and in what direction, must an organism move over a period to stay in\nthe same temperature conditions in which it started?^15,16. Species have\nvarying ability to shift their range in response to climate change; on\naverage, marine organisms can move more quickly than terrestrial species, and\ntrees have among the slowest responses of all forms of life^7,17,18. Climate\nimpacts to ecology emerge from many sources beyond temperature, including\nchanges in precipitation^14, biogeochemistry^2,15, or interactions among\nspecies^19,20. Species with very short life histories (e.g., bacteria) can\nadapt to a changing climate through evolution, while more complex organisms\nmay be able to employ behavioral adjustments^1,14,21,22. Populations unable to\nadapt or shift their range at sufficient rates may be at risk of\nextirpation\u2013which often takes place abruptly following subsequent extreme\nevents rather than as a slow, linear process accompanying the climatic\nchange^1,23. The climate velocity provides a general metric for perturbations\nto large-scale ecology by the movement of thermal niches, rather than a tool\nto describe all types of impacts^15,16,19.\n\nFuture values of the scalar magnitude of climate velocity (which we refer to\nas the climate speed) under scenarios consistent with present policy exceed\nmean dispersal rates of known terrestrial (\u2a852 km/yr^7,16) and marine species\n(\u22487 km/yr^7) and are expected to redistribute and endanger ecosystems\nglobally^4,6,15. The use of SAI has the potential to contribute an additional\ndimension of particularly rapid temperature change at the start or end of an\nintervention. Abrupt warming and cataclysmic climate speeds (\"termination\nshock\") are possible if an SAI intervention were to be terminated from masking\na higher radiative equilibrium, or potentially dangerous cooling may occur at\nthe start of an intervention intended to rapidly reduce global\ntemperatures^18,24. While the specific choices involved in generating a\ntermination shock are clear^18,24,25, the strategic design decisions that\ncould result in dangerous cooling rates are currently unknown.\n\nWe analyze climate speeds in the 20-year period following SAI deployment in\nsimulations performed in the Community Earth System Model Version 2 with Whole\nAtmosphere Community Climate Model (CESM2[WACCM6]) under the Assessing\nResponses and Impacts of Solar climate intervention on the Earth system with\nstratospheric aerosol injection (ARISE) protocol^11,26,27. ARISE simulations\nwere constructed to allow outcomes to be directly connected to specific\nstrategic design choices in each scenario. The ARISE-1.5 scenario portrays the\ndeployment of SAI in 2035 to maintain the Paris Agreement global temperature\ntarget of 1.5 \u00b0C above preindustrial against moderate-mitigation climate\nchange (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway [SSP] 2-4.5)^11. ARISE-DelayedStart has a\nsimilar target of \u22481.37 \u00b0C but SAI deployment in 2045, yielding a rapid\ntemperature reduction due to warming over the intervening decade^28. A 10-year\nperiod represents a plausible delay that could come about from global\ngovernance and decision-making processes^12,29. We compare these scenarios\nagainst baselines of preindustrial climate variability over the millennium\nprior to 1850 (Last Millennium, 850\u20131849) and no-SAI climate change consistent\nwith present policy (SSP2-4.5)^26,30,31,32,33.\n\n## Results\n\n### Distinct responses linked to strategic choices\n\nGlobal maps of climate speeds (Fig. 1) reveal highly distinct outcomes in the\npattern of ecosystem risk in each of the four scenarios, reflecting their\nindividual temperature trends over time (Fig. 2).\n\nFig. 1: 20-year climate speeds of 2-meter temperature on land and ocean.\n\n20-year climate speeds of 2-meter (2m) temperature on land (left column) and\nocean (right column) in the ensemble mean for Shared Socioeconomic Pathway\n2-4.5 (SSP2-4.5) (a, b), the mean of ten 20-year periods (to match ensemble\nsize in Assessing Responses and Impacts of Solar climate intervention on the\nEarth system (ARISE) simulations, see \u201cMethods\u201d section) in the Last\nMillennium (c, d), and ensemble mean for ARISE-1.5 (e, f), and ARISE-\nDelayedStart (g, h). The sign indicates whether the change in temperature\nassociated with the climate speed is positive or negative.

Thick lines portray the ensemble mean; shading shows variability\nspanning the maximum to minimum ensemble member at each year. Vertical dashed\nlines denote the deployment of SAI in 2035 (ARISE-1.5) and 2045 (ARISE-\nDelayedStart), while the horizontal dotted line displays an approximate\ntemperature threshold of 1.5 \u00b0C above preindustrial. Colors used to\ndistinguish different simulations.\n\nFull size image\n\nSubstantial climate speeds forced by warming occur nearly globally under no-\nSAI SSP2-4.5 (Fig. 1a, b). The majority of land area (61%) is exposed to\npotentially dangerous climate speeds beyond 2 km/yr (Supplementary Fig. 1a).\nVery large climate speeds are projected to cause extreme ecosystem stress in\ntropical regions where spatial gradients are weak (Fig. 1a, b)^6,34. For\nexample, ensemble mean climate speeds averaged over the Amazon region (as\ndefined by the IPCC Working Group 1 Fifth Assessment Report^35) are 12 km/yr,\nsuggesting that tropical terrestrial species would need to move poleward or up\ntopography by 240 km in order to remain in their starting conditions over this\n20-year period. Sharp topographic gradients buffer climate speeds and allow\nrelict populations to shelter in microclimates, but these communities often\nhave low connectivity^5,36 and persistent warming may render these niches\ninaccessible^5,16,36,37. Poor connectivity can occur elsewhere due to causes\nincluding fragmentation by human land use such as urbanization^38,39, or\nnatural barriers as in semi-enclosed marine basins like the Mediterranean\nSea^40. This fragmentation impedes the ability of many ecological communities\nto shift in response to climate changes and may increase population\nvulnerability^36,38,41.\n\nIn the ocean, while depth gradients in temperature allow some species to\nescape climate change, non-thermal constraints prevent many from shifting\nvertically^15,34,42. Climate speeds are large in the Arctic, where the warming\nrate is high due to Arctic amplification^43. Transport barriers imposed by the\nedge of continents and the North Pole mark poleward limits on terrestrial and\nmarine species^4,44. Negative climate speeds occur in the North Atlantic\nwarming hole (Fig. 1b) where a decreasing temperature trend is driven by the\nweakening Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation in these\nsimulations^45,46. Analogous to historical ecosystem responses to persistent\ninternally-driven temperature anomalies^1,47, it is possible the North\nAtlantic may experience competing ecosystem responses between negative climate\nspeeds associated with the warming hole and positive climate speeds elsewhere\nin the basin.\n\nClimate speeds averaged over ten 20-year periods from the Last Millennium\n(Fig. 1c, d) are small, reflecting the relatively smaller magnitudes and\nslower evolution of climate forcings over this epoch. Volcanoes exert the\nlargest external forcing on surface temperatures over the Last Millennium, but\ntheir influence is highly nonlinear and only persists for a few years^48,49.\nAs the climate velocity does not provide meaningful insight on these\ntimescales^15, we omit periods within 5 years of a large volcanic eruption\n(defined as 10 teragrams of stratospheric sulfate injection^31). Internally-\ndriven climate variability^50,51, natural phenomena such as solar cycles^52,\nsmall volcanic eruptions^53, or anthropogenic land-use changes^54 can still\ncause nonzero regional-scale climate speeds (e.g., in Eastern Europe on Fig.\n1c). Climate speeds are larger over the ocean (Fig. 1d) than land (Fig. 1c),\nreflecting the smaller spatial temperature gradients in marine\nenvironments^34. Where temperature gradients are shallowest over the tropical\noceans, even small perturbations to temperature can drive nonzero climate\nspeeds^34. The small magnitude of these climate speeds indicate internal\nvariability and natural forcings over this period could lead to distributional\nshifts among species, but would not likely exceed their dispersal\ncapabilities. A purely unforced simulation with boundary conditions fixed at\n1850 (Supplementary Fig. 2) produces qualitatively similar results.\n\nThe 20-year climate speeds following deployment of ARISE-1.5 in the year 2035\n(Fig. 1e, f) to maintain global mean temperature at 1.5 \u00b0C above preindustrial\nare relatively small compared to no-SAI SSP2-4.5 (Fig. 1a, b). These climate\nspeeds reflect the nearly flat temperature trends implied by the use of SAI to\nmaintain temperature (Fig. 2). Over land, climate speeds in ARISE-1.5 (Fig.\n1e) are similar in magnitude to those in the Last Millennium simulation (Fig.\n1c). Climate speeds over the ocean (Fig. 1f) are largely negative in sign.\nSince global temperatures are slightly above the 1.5 \u00b0C target when the\nintervention is deployed in 2035, ARISE-1.5 forces a small negative trend in\ntemperature (Fig. 2). On regional scales, internal climate variability can\noverwhelm the forced response to the SAI intervention (e.g., Fig. 1f in the\neastern Pacific)^55,56. Negative climate speeds occur in the North Atlantic\nwarming hole similar to no-SAI SSP2-4.5, as the weakening of the Atlantic\nMeridional Overturning Circulation is partially offset\u2013but not halted\u2013by the\nSAI intervention in ARISE-1.5^11,46,57. Much more ocean area is exposed to\nclimate speeds of 2 km/yr (48%) and 5 km/yr (17%) in ARISE-1.5 than the Last\nMillennium (23% and 8%, respectively). These values are within the observed\nmean dispersal rates of marine species (\u22487 km/yr^3,7), and little area is\nexposed to climate speeds that exceed these values in ARISE-1.5 (Supplementary\nFig. 1b).\n\nThe SAI strategy in ARISE-DelayedStart produces large 20-year climate speeds\n(Fig. 1g, h) due to the negative temperature trend necessary to quickly reach\nthe temperature target following deployment in 2045 (Fig. 2). A greater amount\nof land and ocean area is exposed to dangerous climate speeds in ARISE-\nDelayedStart (Fig. 1g, h) as opposed to no-SAI SSP2-4.5 (Fig. 1a, b;\nSupplementary Fig. 1). Two-thirds of land area (66%) is exposed to climate\nspeeds beyond 2 km/yr; 13% of total land area (comparable to the size of South\nAmerica) and more than a third of the world ocean (35%) are exposed to climate\nspeeds greater than 10 km/yr in ARISE-DelayedStart (Supplementary Fig. 1).\nFive percent of the ocean is exposed to climate speeds beyond 50 km/yr (Fig.\n1h, Supplementary Fig. 1b), which surpasses even the capability for extreme\nrange shifts observed in many invasive species^58. During the 20-year period\nfollowing deployment, ARISE-DelayedStart depicts a forcing from climate speeds\nto global and regional ecosystems (Fig. 1g, h) that exceeds the corresponding\ntime period in no-SAI SSP2-4.5 (Fig. 1a, b), and draws a striking contrast to\nthe small values under ARISE-1.5 (Supplementary Fig. 3). This phenomenon of\nlarge climate speeds forced by rapid global temperature reduction could be\nviewed as a \u201cdeployment shock,\" similar to the termination shock previously\nidentified if an intervention ceases at a high radiative equilibrium^18,24.\n\n### Internal climate variability modulates conditions\n\nLand and ocean median climate speeds in the Last Millennium simulation (Fig.\n3a) illustrate the range of values experienced in 20-year periods in the\npreindustrial climate. The small magnitude of these climate speeds are within\nthe range of dispersal rates for terrestrial and marine species^7,16. When\nconsidering the full distribution of 20-year periods during the Last\nMillennium, climate speeds infrequently exceed mean dispersal rates of\nterrestrial species (\u22482 km/yr) and never exceed those of marine species (\u22487\nkm/yr) (Supplementary Fig. 9a). Median climate speeds over both the land and\nocean from the ARISE-1.5 scenario where SAI is used to maintain global mean\ntemperature fall within the distribution of Last Millennium variability (Fig.\n3a). The global land and ocean median climate speeds in ARISE-1.5 are\nstatistically indistinguishable from the Last Millennium simulation under a\nrobustness test^56. Climate speeds under no-SAI SSP2-4.5 robustly exceed both\nthe Last Millennium and ARISE-1.5 over the land and ocean. In ARISE-\nDelayedStart, climate speeds surpass all other scenarios: the distribution is\nentirely separated from ARISE-1.5 or the Last Millennium, and robustly larger\nin magnitude than no-SAI SSP2-4.5 over land.\n\nFig. 3: Magnitude of global median climate speed and different realizations\nunder internal variability.\n\nMagnitude of global median climate speed of 2-meter temperature over land and\nocean (a) in Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5 (SSP2-4.5), Last Millennium,\nand Assessing Responses and Impacts of Solar climate intervention on the Earth\nsystem (ARISE) 1.5 and DelayedStart simulations. Maps of ensemble member with\nminimum (b), near-ensemble mean (c), and maximum (d) median climate speed over\nland in ARISE-DelayedStart. In [a], open circles denote climate speeds within\nthe mean dispersal speed of terrestrial or ocean species, closed circles\nsignify climate speeds exceeding mean dispersal speeds, and vertical bars show\nthe ensemble mean. Arrows in (a) denote ensemble members (b\u2013d). Climate speeds\nare calculated over 2035\u20132054 (ARISE-1.5), 2045\u20132064 (ARISE-DelayedStart and\nSSP2-4.5), and ten 20-year periods (Last Millennium). Colors in (a)\ndistinguish different simulations. See Supplementary Figs. 4\u20137 for individual\nmembers in all simulations. Masked ocean area is shown in gray (b\u2013d).\n\nFull size image\n\nContributions from internal variability are large on decadal to interdecadal\ntimescales, such as the 20-year periods examined here, even in the presence of\nan external climate forcing such as an SAI intervention^50,55,56. While\nanalyzing the ensemble mean (Fig. 1) allows for investigation of the response\nto a climate forcing, each individual ensemble member (Fig. 3b, c, d)\nillustrates a plausible representation of the conditions that could be\nexperienced under a single realization of internal variability. We describe\nthe evolution of members across the ensemble of ARISE-DelayedStart to provide\nan example of the role of internal variability in the presence of a forced\nresponse to an SAI scenario of rapid temperature reduction. Climate speeds are\nlarge across the ensemble of ARISE-DelayedStart, exceeding dispersal rates in\nmarine (\u22487 km/yr) and terrestrial species (\u2a852 km/yr) in every ensemble member\nover land and six members over the ocean (Fig. 3a). Still, on regional scales\nin individual members, internal variability from sources such as the El Ni\u00f1o-\nSouthern Oscillation or Pacific Decadal Variability can moderate trends or\neven flip their sign (Fig. 3b)^50. Other members display a spatial pattern\nmore similar to the ensemble mean (Fig. 3c). When average global trends from\ninternal variability are in phase with the forced response, individual\nrealizations can experience negative climate speeds of greater magnitude\neverywhere around the globe (Fig. 3d). In one realization of ARISE-\nDelayedStart, this amplification from internal variability produces extreme\nmedian climate speeds over the global ocean exceeding 10 km/yr.\n\nPrevious analysis shows that the noise introduced by internal variability may\nimpede detection of the surface climate response and lead to the perceived\nfailure of an intervention^8,55,59. The planetary-scale cooling in ARISE-\nDelayedStart is strong enough to entirely separate its distribution from no-\nSAI SSP2-4.5 when the sign of the trend is considered (Supplementary Fig. 9b);\neven in the member with the smallest global median climate speed, few regions\nsee a sign opposite to the forced response (Fig. 3b). These results suggest\nthat perceived failure at a regional or planetary scale would be much less\nlikely under scenarios with rapid temperature reduction.\n\n### Relative ecological risk from climate speeds\n\nClimate speeds of 10 km/yr provide a threshold of extreme risk by exceeding\nthe dispersal rates of both adaptable families (such as mammals) and\nterrestrial and marine species on average^7,16,18. We plot the global area\nexposed to these climate speeds against the annual rate of global temperature\nchange for a wide range of datasets to efficiently summarize ecological risk\n(Fig. 4; see Table 1 for detailed data descriptions) and subsequently describe\nthe implications for each product in the context of this figure.\n\nFig. 4: Relative ecological risk given by rate of temperature change and\nglobal area exposed to climate speed beyond 10 km/yr.\n\n20-year rate of temperature change per year vs. percent of area exposed to a\nclimate speed of 2-meter temperature with magnitude greater than 10 km/yr for\nvarious scenarios of climate change, climate intervention, and historical\nproducts. Dots denote the ensemble mean, and lines display the width of the\nensemble variability. The colors of each dot help visually distinguish\ndatasets from each other. Vertical dashed line shows 20-year change in\ntemperature of 0 \u00b0C/yr. Horizontal dashed line represents the maximum 20-year\narea exposed to threshold climate speed in the Last Millennium variability\n(10%). See Table 1 for detailed descriptions of each dataset in figure, which\nare listed here from left to right: the United Kingdom Earth System Model 1\n(UKESM1)-Assessing Responses and Impacts of Solar climate intervention on the\nEarth system (ARISE)-1.5, Community Earth System Model 2 (CESM2)-ARISE-1.0,\nCESM2-ARISE-DelayedStart, Community Earth System Model 1\n(CESM1)-Geoengineering Large ENSemble (GLENS)-Stratospheric Aerosol Injection\n(SAI), CESM2-ARISE-1.5, Last Millennium, CESM2-Shared Socioeconomic Pathway\n1-2.6 (SSP1-2.6), European Reanalysis 5 (ERA5), CESM2-SSP2-4.5,\nCESM2-Historical, UKESM1-SSP2-4.5, and CESM1-Representative Concentration\nPathway 8.5 (RCP8.5).\n\nFull size image\n\nTable 1 Table of all datasets used to calculate climate speeds\n\nFull size table\n\nThe mean of all non-overlapping 20-year Last Millennium time periods is\nlocated at the origin, reflecting conditions that ecosystems experienced over\nthe millennium before the Industrial Revolution began. The maximum area\nexposed (10% of global area) to the threshold climate speed over Last\nMillennium variability is denoted by the horizontal dotted line (Fig. 4).\nGreater distance from the origin beyond this dotted line denotes a relatively\nhigher profile of ecological risk.\n\nThe European Reanalysis Version 5 (ERA5)^60 provides an observationally\nconstrained global estimate of climate speeds during the recent past\n(1996\u20132015)^60,61. Over this same period, a historical simulation\n(CESM2-Historical^27) displays a larger area exposed to the threshold climate\nspeed and a higher rate of temperature change than in ERA5. The physical\nreasons underlying the overly rapid warming rate in CESM2-Historical during\nthis period are an ongoing area of research, and likely include errors in\nprescribed biomass burning emissions^62. More generally, discrepancies between\nERA5 and historical simulations may partly be due to structural differences\nbetween the single realization of real-world climate variability and the\nensemble mean forced response^63. Overall, both ERA5 and CESM2-Historical\ndisplay climate speeds beyond Last Millennium conditions and within the range\nof mid-century SSP2-4.5, consistent with known historical and expected future\necosystem stress from warming^1,3,6,7,37,42.\n\nNo-SAI future scenarios expose substantial global area to large climate speeds\nfrom warming and cluster on the right half of Fig. 4. Scenarios with higher\nmitigation (SSP1-2.6), moderate mitigation (SSP2-4.5), and no mitigation\n(RCP8.5) all exceed the Last Millennium baseline, with increased emissions\ncausing greater ecological risk. The relatively higher risk portrayed in the\nSSP2-4.5 simulation in the United Kingdom Earth System Model version 1\n(UKESM1-SSP2-4.5) (see \u201cMethods\u201d section for full description) as opposed to\nCESM2-SSP2-4.5 primarily stems from the more rapid warming rates due to the\nhigher climate sensitivity in UKESM1^64. The above results are in keeping with\nprevious findings of widespread ecosystem stress under all future emissions\npathways^1,2,3,4,5,6,7,37,42, with the most extreme risks from climate change\nunder scenarios with no mitigation^34,65.\n\nScenarios where SAI is used for rapid temperature reduction cluster on the\nleft side of the figure above the Last Millennium baseline and expose large\namounts of global area to high climate speeds from rapid cooling. The\nindividual scenarios (see Table 1 for details) each depict a unique potential\ndesign choice that could produce a deployment shock. One pathway would be\nthrough a delayed start with deployment after a temperature target has been\nsurpassed, either through the choice to deliberately postpone deployment\n(ARISE-DelayedStart) or if the temperature threshold is breached early due to\nhigh climate sensitivity (UKESM1-ARISE-1.5^57). Alternatively, the\nintervention could be deployed with the explicit goal of obtaining a low-\ntemperature target below the starting global mean value\n(CESM2-ARISE-1.0^11,12, or the simulations of ref. ^66 [not shown]).\nRegardless of the underlying strategic logic, the salient point is that every\nSAI scenario with rapid temperature reduction exposes more global area to the\nthreshold climate speed than its corresponding no-SAI climate change reference\nscenario: CESM2-ARISE-1.0 and CESM2-ARISE-DelayedStart compared to\nCESM2-SSP2-4.5, and UKESM1-ARISE-1.5 compared to UKESM1-SSP2-4.5.\n\nSAI scenarios where the intervention is used to maintain global mean\ntemperature (CESM2-ARISE-1.5, CESM1-GLENS-SAI) remain near the origin, with\nensemble means within the bounds of Last Millennium conditions. These SAI\nscenarios essentially eliminate the most extreme risks to ecosystems from\nclimate speeds occurring in the no-SAI climate change scenarios. However, a\n10-year delay in deployment is the predominant difference between ARISE-1.5\nand ARISE-DelayedStart. This short delay is sufficient to produce a highly\ndistinct profile of extreme ecological risk.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis work demonstrates a key difference between scenarios where SAI is used to\nmaintain global temperature, and those where SAI causes rapid temperature\nreduction. Scenarios that maintain global temperature greatly reduce risks\nfrom climate speeds, with global-scale parameters statistically\nindistinguishable from Last Millennium conditions. In contrast, rapid\ntemperature reduction scenarios increase ecological risk (\"deployment shock\")\nrelative to their corresponding no-SAI scenarios. The design of the ARISE\nscenarios allow these conclusions to be connected to specific potential\ndecisions: a policy-relevant delay in deployment can turn a scenario that\nwould otherwise greatly reduce ecological risk from climate speeds by\nmaintaining temperature (ARISE-1.5) into one with a deployment shock that\nworsens this risk relative to no-SAI climate change (ARISE-DelayedStart).\n\nOur results arise in policy-relevant scenarios designed for\nplausibility^11,12, as opposed to termination scenarios created to illustrate\nrisks of SAI^24. Deployment shock demonstrates a risk that intrinsically\naccompanies the ability to rapidly change temperature. This may restrict the\nability to safely return to a temperature target after it has been surpassed.\nIt is theoretically possible to design a strategy with sufficiently slow ramp-\nup of SAI to allow ecosystems to respond to the forcing. However, SAI\nscenarios where global temperature is reduced are usually framed as an\naggressive response option to relieve some severe impact of climate\nchange^9,67, prevent tipping points^68, or to facilitate rapid detection by\nproviding a large signal-to-noise ratio^12,59. The strategic choice to slowly\nimplement a low-temperature target may be in tension with these same goals.\n\nClimate speeds are typically used for measuring ecosystem responses and risks\nin a warming climate^15,16,34, which raises the question of whether they are\nas meaningful for a cooling climate. Observed range shifts track temperature\ntrends from internal climate variability regardless of their sign, strongly\nindicating both cooling and warming are ecologically relevant^1,47. While\nrelicts that temporarily survive warming through persistence or by sheltering\nin microclimates^36,37 would likely benefit from rapid cooling, numerous\necosystems that have transitioned to a new state under warming may be suddenly\njeopardized. Paleoclimatic data indicates periods with rapid (interannual to\nmultidecadal) large-scale cooling following a long-term warming trend coincide\nwith planetary-scale changes to ecosystems^69,70. These findings support the\npossibility that abrupt global cooling embedded in an antecedent warming trend\ncould cause a large disturbance to ecosystems.\n\nInsight from climate speeds can help inform future scenario design and\ndecision-making. Designing scenarios to avoid deployment shock constrains both\nglobal temperature target and deployment year, which helps prevent a\ncombinatorial explosion in scenario design^12. We note two scenarios within\nthese constraints that have not yet been simulated: delayed start maintenance\nwith deployment dates past 2035 and higher temperature targets to avoid rapid\ntemperature reduction, and slow starts where the intervention is implemented\nover sufficient time to moderate climate speeds. Decisions about global\nenvironmental policy involve complex tradeoffs of risk from many processes and\nphenomena^67. As research concretely identifies sources of these tradeoffs in\nSAI scenarios, the relative prioritization of risks should be transparently\ndocumented during the design of a given scenario to help aid in analysis and\neffective decision-making.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Primary simulations\n\nOur work draws on data from three simulations (SSP2-4.5, ARISE-1.5, and ARISE-\nDelayedStart) using the Community Earth System Model Version 2 with Whole\nAtmosphere Community Climate Model version 6 (CESM2[WACCM6])^26,27.\nCESM2(WACCM6) is a fully interactive Earth system model with a high-fidelity\ndepiction of the climate, including the stratospheric processes thought to be\nmost relevant to SAI^26,27,71. For all simulations here, CESM2(WACCM6) was run\nwith 70 vertical levels (model top \u2248140 km) and 1.25\u00b0 longitude \u00d7 0.9\u00b0\nlatitude horizontal resolution^11. This spatial scale (Table 1) is considered\nadequate to analyze global ecosystem risk in the broader ecology\nliterature^4,15,18.\n\nThe CESM2(WACCM6ma) Last Millennium dataset is a simulation of the 1000-year\ninterval 850 through 1849, immediately preceding the Industrial Revolution\nwhich is defined to begin in 1850 by convention in the climate modeling\ncommunity^26,30 Relatively abundant paleoclimate data allows for a well-\nconstrained long-record depiction of this period including natural\nvariability, realistic natural forcings including volcanoes and solar cycles,\nand anthropogenic land-use changes^31. We use the Last Millennium to provide\nan ecologically relevant baseline of climate variability and change before\nanthropogenic climate change through greenhouse gas emissions and\nindustrialization became large. CESM2(WACCM6ma) is a middle-atmosphere\nconfiguration of CESM2(WACCM6) and includes a simplified chemistry scheme to\nreduce computational complexity. The climate of CESM2(WACCM6ma) is very\nsimilar to CESM2(WACCM6) apart from the tropospheric chemistry^72.\n\nThe SSP2-4.5 simulations depict a no-SAI future with moderate mitigation of\nclimate change and the slow deployment of negative emissions technologies^32.\nFive ensemble members were created for the Coupled Model Intercomparison\nProject Phase 6^51. An additional five ensemble members were created to\naugment the sample size for the ARISE project^11. All 10 realizations are\navailable from 2015\u20132069. SSP2-4.5 is consistent with present-day policy\npledges by the global community, though it still results in warming beyond\nParis Agreement targets in CESM2 and other climate models^33,73.\n\nWe use the ARISE-1.5 and ARISE-DelayedStart datasets to explore two policy-\nrelevant SAI scenarios^11,28. These simulations are often referred to as\nARISE-SAI-1.5 and ARISE-SAI-1.37-DelayedStart. We use the names ARISE-1.5 and\nARISE-DelayedStart for brevity, or CESM2-ARISE-1.5 and CESM2-ARISE-\nDelayedStart when necessary to distinguish from scenarios run in other models.\nSAI in ARISE-1.5 is deployed in 2035 to maintain global mean temperature at\nthe 2020\u20132039 average in CESM2(WACCM6) (\u22481.5 ^\u2218C above the IPCC AR6\npreindustrial value)^11,74. In ARISE-DelayedStart, SAI is deployed 10 years\nlater in 2045 with a similar global mean temperature target of the 2020\u20132039\naverage from CESM1(WACCM5) (\u22481.37 \u00b0C above the IPCC AR6 preindustrial value)\nto depict the impacts of a policy-relevant delay in deployment^12. ARISE-\nDelayedStart requires a larger stratospheric sulfate burden than ARISE-1.5 due\nboth to the delayed start and the slightly lower temperature target^12,28.\n\nOther design choices are constant between ARISE-1.5 and ARISE-DelayedStart:\nsulfur dioxide is injected at the same height (\u224821 km), SSP2-4.5 greenhouse\nforcing is used in both, and each ensemble has ten members. Injections occur\ncontinuously from four locations (30^\u2218 and 15\u00b0 N/S, all at 180\u00b0 E) with a\nproportional-integral feedback-control algorithm to maintain the pole-to-pole\nand pole-to-equator temperature gradients alongside the global temperature\ntarget^11,75. Controlling for these goals with off-equatorial injections is\nintended to reduce side effects by compensating for the planetary-scale\nspatial patterns of greenhouse warming: the increase in global mean\ntemperature, hemispheric asymmetry, and polar amplification^76.\n\nARISE-1.5 and ARISE-DelayedStart are identical to SSP2-4.5 in every way except\nfor the SAI intervention. Therefore, consistent differences between the\nsimulations are likely due to the SAI strategies. The effect sizes of the SAI\ninterventions in ARISE-1.5 and ARISE-DelayedStart relative to SSP2-4.5 are\nlarge enough that the global-scale results are clearly due to the SAI\nintervention (i.e., ensemble mean global temperature trend changing sign\nworldwide). Where useful, we additionally use the robustness test as a non-\nparametric method to identify where the forced response to the SAI\nintervention is large^56. We refer to results as robust when they pass this\ntest (corresponding to p < 0.1 under a binomial test).\n\nThe CESM2(WACCM6) Preindustrial control (Unforced) provides a single 500-year\nintegration of the Earth system with perpetual 1850 greenhouse gas forcing^26.\nThis simulation illustrates the range of internal climate variability over an\nextended period of time without external forcings^51. The small climate speeds\nin the Unforced simulation (Supplementary Fig. 2) raise confidence that the\nmodel is adequate for our analysis: while internal climate variability can\nproduce pronounced ecosystem impacts in individual regions, planetary-scale\nrisk to ecosystems would be implausible under unforced variability alone^1,47.\nWe use Unforced as a reference to perfectly-unforced conditions under internal\nvariability alone, although land-use changes during and before 1850 imply it\ndoes not perfectly represent true equilibrium conditions^54.\n\n### Climate velocity\n\nThe climate velocity of a geophysical quantity describes the movement of the\nisopleths of that variable in a changing climate^16. Formally, the climate\nvelocity is defined as the ratio of the temporal gradient of a variable A\n(\\\\(\\frac{dA}{dt}\\\\), units time^\u22121) to the spatial gradient of that same\nvariable (\\\\(\\overrightarrow{\\nabla }A\\\\), units space^\u22121)^16. The resultant\nvariable (\\\\(\\overrightarrow{{C}_{A}}\\\\)) has units of space per time\u2013that is,\na velocity (Equation (1))^16.\n\n$$\\frac{\\frac{dA}{dt}}{\\overrightarrow{\\nabla }A}=\\overrightarrow{{C}_{A}}$$\n\n(1)\n\nClimate velocity can be calculated for any variable but is most frequently\napplied to temperature^15. Temperature exhibits a clear large-scale response\nto both climate change and SAI and has relatively well-understood\nspatiotemporal behavior in both observations and model output^15. We use 2 m\ntemperature rather than sea surface temperature over the ocean due to data\navailability limitations in ARISE-DelayedStart at the time of writing. On\nclimatological spatiotemporal scales, 2 m temperature is similar to sea\nsurface temperature and is often used for aquatic ecosystem analysis^77,78.\n\nThe climate velocity is a vector quantity, with both a magnitude and a\ndirection. The scalar magnitude alone (climate speed) can be used separately\nfrom the vector quantity to quantify the high-level degree of disturbance to\necosystems^18,34,79,80. This degree of disturbance is the quantity of interest\nfor our research questions, and we use the climate speed exclusively in our\nanalysis. We provide climate velocity vector maps for additional context\n(Supplementary Fig. 11), however, we caution readers that local analysis of\nthese vectors would require a much finer-resolution dataset to better capture\nspatial gradients^15,16,40,80.\n\nFollowing standard methods, we calculate the temporal gradient of temperature\nusing linear regression and the spatial gradient of temperature using the 3 \u00d7\n3 neighborhood slope algorithm^15,16,18,34. In the accompanying Python code\n(fun_calc_var.py), we implement the Sobel operator (mathematically equivalent\nto the 3 \u00d7 3 neighborhood slope algorithm) to obtain the spatial gradient of\ntemperature. We calculate both our temporal gradient and spatial gradient\ndirectly from each dataset. At each point for each ensemble member, we divide\nthe local 20-year temporal gradient (10-year for UKESM1 only, see below) by\nthe spatial gradient and take the vector magnitude to obtain the climate\nspeed. We impose a sign on the climate speed to denote whether it is\nassociated with a warming or cooling trend. For all figures, we take the\nensemble mean after the calculation of the climate speed. Climate speeds may\nbe overestimated around complex topography in datasets with coarse spatial\nresolution^15. Our results are robust to the choice of spatial resolution at\nthe scale of all datasets used in this work (demonstrated for ERA5 in\nSupplementary Fig. 10).\n\nBy convention, climate velocities and climate speeds are assessed over time\nperiods of 10 years or longer^15,16,18. We calculate the climate speed over\ntime periods chosen to be relevant to each scenario. For the scenarios with\nSAI in CESM2, this is the 20-year period immediately following deployment:\n2035\u20132054 in ARISE-1.5, and 2045\u20132064 in ARISE-DelayedStart. 20-year timespans\nencompass the entire period when global mean temperature is decreasing in\nARISE-DelayedStart. For no-SAI SSP2-4.5, we use the period 2045\u20132064 to\ncompare to results from ARISE-DelayedStart. The time period 2035\u20132054\n(corresponding to ARISE-1.5) is very similar in CESM2 simulations of SSP2-4.5,\nas the rate of change in global mean temperature does not alter substantially\nbetween 2035 and 2064. The time period spanning the interval when global mean\ntemperature is decreasing in an SAI scenario is model-dependent and needs to\nbe adjusted to correspond to the model that generated a given dataset. In\nUKESM1, a 10-year period fully encompasses the cooling after deployment due to\nits high aerosol sensitivity^57,81. Thus, we calculate climate speeds over\n10-year periods for output from UKESM1 as opposed to 20-year periods for all\nother products on Fig. 4. Using 20-year periods for UKESM1 would artificially\nreduce the climate speeds during its deployment shock by spreading the cooling\nout past the time horizon when global mean temperature has stabilized. In\ncontrast, using the shorter 10-year periods for CESM2 would overlook the\nsubstantial cooling that continues past this horizon (Fig. 2).\n\nThe 10-member ensemble size of ARISE-1.5, ARISE-DelayedStart, and SSP2-4.5\nenlarges the number of years available for analysis over each 20-year period\nto an effective size of 200 years^50. Since the Last Millennium has only one\nensemble member but a 1000-year simulation period, we choose ten 20-year time\nperiods to avoid large volcanic eruptions (10 teragrams of stratospheric\nsulfate injection^31): years 851\u2013870, 871\u2013890, 891\u2013910, 911\u2013930, 945\u2013964,\n971\u2013990, 991\u20131010, 1011\u20131030, 1031\u20131050, 1051\u20131070. Avoiding such eruptions is\nnecessary due to their large, but brief, impacts on global climate, which\nviolate the linear trend assumptions underlying the definition of the climate\nvelocity^15. We additionally calculate the full distribution of non-\noverlapping 20-year climate speeds (again omitting large volcanic eruptions)\nin the Last Millennium for use in Fig. 4. Similarly, we choose ten 20-year\ntime periods (years 5\u201324, 43\u201362, 95\u2013114, 124\u2013143, 164\u2013183, 259\u2013278, 280\u2013299,\n336\u2013355, 379\u2013398, 465\u2013484) from the Unforced simulation to obtain a comparable\nsample size of 200 years, where relevant.\n\nThere is a wealth of ecological literature pertaining to the question of which\nclimate speed values and periods of time correspond to ecosystem impacts on\nland and in the ocean. We cite only the most critical literature in the main\nbody of the paper to remain within citation count restrictions, and provide\nreferences here for a fuller selection of this body of work for terrestrial\necosystems^7,16,34,82,83,84,85, marine ecosystems^3,7,34,82,84, and\ninterannual to multidecadal range shifts^1,47,86,87,88,89,90,91.\n\n### Additional data\n\nWe use a broad selection of data in Fig. 4 to discuss the relative risk\nbetween a variety of future scenarios of climate change and climate\nintervention and various depictions of the historical period.
