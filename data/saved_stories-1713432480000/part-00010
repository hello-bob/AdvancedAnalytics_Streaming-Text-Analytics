Please let me know if there is a set of politicians / an\nelection that you like me to add!\n\n## Overview\n\nI threw together Candidly over the course of a couple days, after discovering\nthe \"Build with Claude\" contest. It's a web app which uses Claude to help keep\nvoters informed about politicians they vote for. Currently, it tracks\ncandidates from California's Senate 11th District election.\n\n  * Politicians Basic profiles of politicians.\n  * Search and Filter: Learn about the polticians you're voting for through their specific remarks or policy decisions.\n  * Simple Interface: Spent some time trying to make the UX intuitive!\n\n# The idea\n\nIdeally, the platform would include a comprehensive repository of politicians'\nrecent speeches, bills, actions, and tweets, offering an up-to-date reflection\nof their work and opinions. (For now, only had time to index their tweets, a\ncouple recent talks, and some policy decisions.\n\n## About\n\nvotecandidly.com/\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n2 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n1 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n0 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n  * TypeScript 46.5%\n  * Jupyter Notebook 45.1%\n  * CSS 7.1%\n  * JavaScript 1.3%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
