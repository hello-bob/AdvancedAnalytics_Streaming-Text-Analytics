Addressing\nemployees at the location of the company's Starship factory, Musk spoke about\nthe \"high urgency\" needed to extend the \"light of consciousness\" beyond Earth.\nThat is not because humanity's home planet is a lost cause or should not be\npreserved. Rather, Musk said, he does not want humanity to remain a one-planet\ncivilization that will, inevitably, face some calamity that will end the\nspecies.\n\nAll of this is fairly familiar territory for spaceflight enthusiasts\u2014and\nobservers of Musk. But during the last eight years he has become an\nincreasingly controversial and polarizing figure. Based on his behavior, many\npeople will dismiss Musk's Mars comments as those of a megalomaniac. At least\nin regard to spaceflight, however, that would be wrong. Musk's multiplanetary\nambitions today are more credible because SpaceX has taken steps toward doing\nwhat he said the company would do.\n\nSpaceX has real hardware today and has completed three test flights. A fourth\nis possible next month.\n\n\"It\u2019s surreal, but it\u2019s real,\" Musk said this weekend, describing the\naudacious Mars vision.\n\n## The booster and ship\n\nAs part of his 45-minute speech, Musk spoke about the booster for Starship,\nthe upper stage, and the company's plans to ultimately deliver millions of\ntons of cargo to Mars for a self-sustaining civilization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf thousands of launches seem impossible, Musk noted that SpaceX has now\ncompleted 327 successful Falcon launches and that 80 percent of those have\ninvolved used boosters. This year, he said, SpaceX will launch about 90\npercent of the mass sent into orbit from the planet. China will launch about 6\npercent, he added, with the remainder of the world accounting for the other 4\npercent.\n\nThis kind of performance has given Musk confidence that reusability can be\nachieved with the Super Heavy booster that powers Starship. On the vehicle's\nnext test flight, possibly in May, the company will attempt to land the\nbooster on a virtual tower in the Gulf of Mexico. If that landing is precise\nenough, SpaceX will try to catch the booster on the fifth test flight with the\nchopstick-like mechanisms on Starship's massive launch tower.\n\nEnlarge / The Raptor rocket engine will see performance upgrades.\n\nSpaceX\n\n\"That\u2019s very much a success-oriented schedule, but it is within the realm of\npossibility,\" Musk said. With multiple test flights occurring this year, Musk\nsaid the odds of catching the booster with the launch tower this year are 80\nto 90 percent.\n\nIt will take longer to land and begin reusing Starship's upper stage, which\nmust survive the fiery reentry through Earth's atmosphere. This vehicle broke\napart and burned up during its attempt to return through the atmosphere during\na flight test in March. On the next flight, Musk said, the goal for Starship's\nupper stage is to survive this heating and make a controlled landing in the\nocean. At some point this year, he expects SpaceX to achieve this milestone\nand then begin landing Starships back in Texas next year.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n838\n\nEric Berger Eric Berger is the senior space editor at Ars Technica, covering\neverything from astronomy to private space to wonky NASA policy, and author of\nthe book Liftoff, about the rise of SpaceX.
