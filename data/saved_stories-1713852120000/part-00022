Harmonia was a \u2018Krautrock\u2019\nsupergroup, bringing together Dieter Moebius and Hans-Joachim Roedelius of\nCluster, and Michael Rother of NEU!. Though Harmonia was not very well known\nduring their lifetime in their native Germany, their music soon captured the\nattention of Brian Eno, David Bowie, and other highprofile admirers overseas.\nEno was so captivated by Harmonia \u2014 he once famously called them the \u201cworld\u2019s\nmost important rock group\u201d \u2014that he briefly joined the band, recording music\nwith them in 1976. \u201cI liked Harmonia because they represented to me all that I\nhad been enjoying about German music in general: a spareness, a rigor, a sense\nof experiment,\u201d says Eno. \u201cThey were a long way from the world of\n\u2018entertainment.\u2019 I didn\u2019t want entertaining at the time. They came \u2014 at least\nspiritually \u2014 from the world of German experimental music: Stockhausen,\nDarmstadt, etc.\u201d\n\nThe story begins in 1971, when Dieter Moebius and Hans-Joachim Roedelius of\nCluster moved from Berlin to the wilds of Forst, deep in the countryside of\nLower Saxony, next to the Weser River. In Forst, they made their homes within\nthree grand, crumbling houses built several centuries ago.\n\nMichael Rother visited Forst in in early 1973. Rother recalls. \u201cWhen Klaus\nDinger and I tried to put NEU! on stage in \u201972 in D\u00fcsseldorf after releasing\nthe first album, it was impossible to find the right musicians for touring\nbecause nobody understood our ideas.\n\nI remembered Cluster and their track \u201eIm S\u00fcden\u201c, and because I saw\nsimilarities in the harmonic approach I decided to pay them a visit in Forst.\u201d\nRother brought his guitar along, and jammed with Roedelius.\n\n\u201cThis sounds romantic \u2014 it was like love at first sight,\u201d says Rother. \u201cThe\ntwo instruments we played together immediately clicked, and so I decided to\nput NEU! on hold. Roedelius and Moebius were equally excited about the idea of\nthe three of us working together and so six weeks later, I left D\u00fcsseldorf and\nNEU! behind and moved to Forst. That\u2019s how Harmonia started.\u201d\n\nThe differences in musical temperament between Roedelius, Moebius and Rother\nwere clear from the outset. \u201cWe are three people and we each have our own kind\nof music,\u201d says Moebius. Of the three, Rother was the only who had something\nresembling musical training; \u201cAs a teenager in the \u201860s I started by copying\nmy musical heroes on the guitar and, by doing that, learning the basics of pop\nmusic,\u201d Rother says. Moebius, meanwhile, had noisier, more anarchic\ninclinations. \u201cI\u2019m more of the punk guy,\u201d he says with a laugh. Roedelius was\nmore overtly romantic and melodic, but his approach to making music had more\nin common with Moebius than with Rother. \u201cMoebius and I didn\u2018t know about\nmusic very much when we started,\u201d Roedelius says. \u201cI was a physiotherapist and\nM\u00f6bi was a graphic designer. We liked to do music and had to find what fit to\nus, to find our own sound language... When Michael came into the game it\nchanged our approach to what we did. We learned a lot about how to compose.\u201d\n\nFew people know that the name \u2018Harmonia\u2019 was initially a joke. \u201cIn Germany\nit\u2019s popular to call a choir a \u2018Harmonia\u2019 something, like \u2018Harmonia\nD\u00fcsseldorf\u2019...we found this signpost in the cellar saying \u2018Harmonia\nOttenstein\u2019, a place near Forst, we chose that name. That was a joke from the\nbeginning. Hardly anyone gets that joke.\u201d\n\nLife in the rambling, rural environs of Forst was as much about surviving with\nlittle money as it was about making music. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important part of the\ngame that we were able to live at that place, in that beautiful island of\nsilence and beauty, surrounded by cows and horses and geese and pigs,\u201d says\nRoedelius. \u201cGoing to the forest and cutting wood and doing the gardens, that\nwas part of it. I think if we wouldn\u2018t have been living there it wouldn\u2018t have\nbeen the same thing at all.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the music of Harmonia is part and parcel of the lush landscape of\nForst, and its communal spirit. \u201cI cannot see a house or a road when I look\nout of the window and over the river \u2014 it\u2019s just fields and mountains and\ngreen,\u201d says Rother.\u201d Roedelius calls Forst an \u201cisland in the midst of\nreality.\u201d\n\nHarmonia released their debut album, Musik von Harmonia, in 1974. The striking\nPop Art cover of a detergent bottle, designed by Moebius, gave the band an\ninstantly iconic and modern look. Each track sounded completely different,\nfrom the rhythmic \u201cWatussi\u201c to the shimmering ambience of \u201cSehr Kosmisch.\u201d\nHarmonia recorded and mixed the album themselves, in Forst. \u201cWe had three\n[tape] machines, Revox type, and a very primitive mixer,\u201d says Rother. \u201cThe\nadvantage was we could work whenever we wanted and didn\u2018t have a studio clock\nticking away. The record sales, however, were very disappointing, our love for\nthe music was not echoed by the public\u201d says Rother.\n\nHarmonia\u2019s second album, Deluxe (1975), was co-produced by the brilliant\nproducer and engineer Conny Plank, who had worked with NEU!, Cluster,\nKraftwerk, and many other bands. At that time, Plank had started his own\nstudio near Cologne. He brought a 16-track mobile MCI recording machine and a\nsmall mixing desk to Forst. Plank stayed in Forst for about two weeks, and\nMani Neumeier, the energetic drummer of Guru Guru, also joined in on a few of\nthe tracks. Deluxe was recorded on Plank\u2019s equipment in Forst in the summer of\n1975, and mixed at his studio soon afterwards.\n\n\u201cWe were very fortunate to have a figure like Conny Plank around, because he\nwas equally crazy,\u201d says Rother. \u201cWe didn\u2018t have to push him to experiment; we\nwere all on the same level. Everybody was looking for new expressions, a new\nway of creating the sound. It was a very creative process, working with Conny.\nI remember some really wonderful moments, because he was so talented in\npicking up your ideas. We never theorized about music, we were intuitive\nplayers, musicians. The same with Conny \u2014 we didn\u2018t explain, or try to put\ninto words what we were doing.\u201d\n\nDeluxe is a breathtaking album, a clear departure in style. It was the most\n\u2018pop\u2019 that Harmonia ever became, with tighter song structures than the more\nsprawling landscapes of Musik von Harmonia.\n\nHowever, the difference in ideas about their music became apparent and hard to\nhandle for Roedelius, Rother and Moebius. After struggling for months about\nthe direction the music of Harmonia should take, Harmonia split up in 1976,\nbut the group briefly reunited later that year to record in Forst with Eno,\nwho was en route to Montreux to work on Low with David Bowie. Brian Eno had\nmet Harmonia in 1974, during a Harmonia concert at Fabrik in Hamburg; Eno\njumped on stage to jam with the band for the second half of their set.\n\nThe band had already decided to part ways when Eno came to Forst. \u201cBrian came\nwhen Harmonia was already dead,\u201d says Roedelius. \u201cWe stopped working together,\neach of us had already recorded albums individually in the summer of \u201976 but\none day Brian called that he would like to come.\u201c\n\n\u201cWhen we worked together we didn\u2019t have a hierarchy at all...it was a small\nanarchic state we lived in,\u201d says Eno. \u201cThe surprise came when I started\nmaking the music into songs, which was not an area that Harmonia had explored\nmuch before. For me, always teetering on the edge of disenchantment with\nsongwriting, this new way into it was thrilling. We made music, and sometimes\nthe music turned into songs. There was no pressure for them to do this.\u201d\n\nThere was no plan to record an album, only to enjoy the exchange of ideas and\nto record them. In later years, the tapes were not available for many years\nand thought to be lost. \u201cTape was so unbelievably expensive \u2014 that was the\nbiggest limit with all our recording,\u201d says Rother. \u201cWe had to re-record over\nour original recordings because we couldn\u2018t afford to buy blank tape. It was\nsuch a problem that when Brian Eno came to visit us in \u201976, he brought two or\nthree blank tapes along. I had a four-track recording machine, and he took\nthose tapes with him, meaning to return to Forst and continue the\ncollaboration. But that didn\u2019t happen so the tapes were lost for a long time,\nuntil Joachim found two of the tapes in the archives in London.\u201d\n\nAfter the Harmonia sessions in 1976 with Eno, the group went their separate\nways. Roedelius, Moebius and Rother continued to record albums, either solo or\nin collaborations with other musicians. All three are still active these days,\neven more so than ever before. Their music has inspired generations of\nmusicians and these days it appeals to audiences, young and old, in a way\nRoedelius, Moebius und Rother couldn\u2019t have imagined in the 1970s.\n\nDespite the differences, there was a shared vision with Harmonia, too. \u201cWe\nwere all different individuals \u2014 that was clear from the beginning,\u201d says\nRother. \u201cBut we were similar in our wish for freedom: freedom in the way we\nchose to live, and in our wish to be independent from record companies and to\nlive a free life. That was something we had in common.\u201d\n\nHarmonia lives on as a document of that magical time in Forst. \u201cIt was a good\ncombination,\u201d says Roedelius. \u201cDoing art, having a good life, doing really\nworking on Earth, standing with our feet on Earth.\u201d\n\nby Geeta Dayal\n\n2017 \u00a9 Groenland Records\n\n  * Impressum\n  * Contact\n\n", "frontpage": false}
