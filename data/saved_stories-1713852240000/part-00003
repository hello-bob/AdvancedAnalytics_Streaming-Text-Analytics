Voisin / The\nWashington Post / Getty Images\n\nThe island of Cuba is going through its worst economic crisis since the\ncollapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. A few weeks ago, the government in\nHavana officially requested powdered milk for children under the age of 7 from\nthe United Nations\u2019 World Food Programme (WFP). By mid-March, as noted by CBS\nNews, \u201csmall groups of protesters took to the streets in the eastern city of\nSantiago\u201d criticizing the \u201cpower outages lasting up to eight hours,\u201d as well\nas the food shortages across the country. In late March, an emergency 715,000\nbarrels of crude arrived at the port of Matanzas from Russia \u2014 the country\u2019s\nfirst oil shipment to Cuba in a year \u2014 while China has recently agreed to\ndeliver 70 tonnes of rice, the first of six shipments totaling 400 tonnes.\n\nIn New York, in an act of solidarity, The People\u2019s Forum (a local NGO) has\nstarted a campaign called \u201cLet Cuba Live: Bread for Our Neighbors\u201d with the\naim of sending \u201c800 tons of wheat flour to Cuba as legal humanitarian aid.\u201d\n\nZuldaimis Biart, a 35-year-old accountant who lives in Havana, told Truthout\nthat the current crisis \u201cis directly affecting low-income people, workers,\nmothers with children and the elderly.\u201d In her personal case, her salary did\n\u201cnot support the minimum needs such as food, medicine, personal hygiene,\nclothing and basic footwear.\u201d\n\nBiart noted that not everyone has access to the digital convertible currency\nknown as \u201cMLC\u201d (free convertible currency) that was introduced three years\nago, as not everyone is receiving remittances from relatives abroad. Arguing\nthat the conditions in education and the public health care system are\ndeteriorating, Biart thinks this is because \u201call state institutions are\nsuffering from mass emigration and lack of resources.\u201d\n\nAsiel \u00c1lvarez, a 34-year-old construction worker from Havana, told Truthout\nthat he is also under stress due to the recent changes in Cuba\u2019s monetary\nsystem, explaining that his \u201csalary has no value to buy any products.\u201d\nAccording to \u00c1lvarez, the power shortages are now constant.\n\n### Related Story\n\nNews\n\n|\n\nPolitics & Elections\n\n## Republican Kicks Barbara Lee Out of Hearing on Cuba Over Pro-Diplomacy\nViews\n\n\u201cYou are doing exactly what you say the Cuban government is,\u201d Lee said.\n\nBy\n\n    Sharon Zhang ,\n    Truthout\n\nJanuary 19, 2024\n\nTruthout\n\nCommenting in the Boston Globe on her recent trip to Cuba, Micho Spring \u2014 a\ncommunications strategist for the marketing firm Weber Shandwick \u2014 noted that\nmuch rubbish can be seen around Havana while public transport has\nsignificantly diminished its operations. \u201cOutside Havana,\u201d wrote Spring, \u201cI\nwas struck by how thin people appear.\u201d\n\nThree years ago, when protests broke out in cities throughout Cuba against the\ncountry\u2019s ongoing power outages and over all declining economic situation,\nPresident Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel quickly took to the streets of Havana where the\ndemonstrations originated. In some heated conversations with local residents,\nwhich were filmed by Cuban state television, D\u00edaz-Canel presented the\ngovernment\u2019s perspective of the crisis. \u201cMy dear, we\u2019ve had to cut the power\nout because we don\u2019t have enough fuel!\u201d he told a visibly distressed senior\ncitizen. In a region where presidents rarely show their faces during a crisis,\nlet alone meet with protestors, D\u00edaz\u2019s move displayed political courage. Today\nthough, the crisis continues.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s oil production is at its lowest rate in decades due to harsh U.S.\neconomic sanctions and Washington\u2019s seizure of the country\u2019s oil company\nCITGO. Cuba, which relies heavily on Venezuelan oil imports, has been impacted\nby this development for several years, sending it into an energy crisis.\nAdding to its woes, the island has yet to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic\nthat forced it to shut down its tourism industry (the largest sector of its\neconomy) as it quarantined itself off from the outside world.\n\nBy January 2021, in an attempt to stabilize the economy, the government ended\nmore than 25 years of a dual currency circulation and reverted to using the\nCuban peso (CUP), which at the time had an exchange rate of 24 for a U.S.\ndollar. Making matters more complicated, with the Cuban convertible peso (CUC)\nabolished, the government introduced a new digital currency known as the MLC.\nWith inflation increasing 70 percent by the end of 2021 alone, the\ngovernment\u2019s move proved widely unpopular among average Cubans and by early\nFebruary 2024, Economy Minister Alejandro Gil was sacked. Now, according to a\nstatement by the Cuban government, the minister is being investigated as the\n\u201cleadership of our Party and government has never allowed, nor will it ever\nallow, the proliferation of corruption, simulation and insensitivity.\u201d\n\nThe greatest culprit of Cuba\u2019s economic hardships, however, is the United\nStates government, which has imposed a harsh economic blockade on the island\nfor over 62 years. In April 1960, in a memorandum by the Deputy Assistant\nSecretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Lester D. Mallory, the U.S.\nofficial noted that the majority of Cubans supported the young revolutionary\nleader Fidel Castro, whose 26 of July Movement had overthrown the brutal\nWashington-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista in January 1959. Based on his\nanalysis, Mallory wrote:\n\n> Every possible means should be undertaken promptly to weaken the economic\n> life of Cuba. If such a policy is adopted, it should be the result of a\n> positive decision which would call forth a line of action which, while as\n> adroit and inconspicuous as possible, makes the greatest inroads in denying\n> money and supplies to Cuba, to decrease monetary and real wages, to bring\n> about hunger, desperation and overthrow of government.\n\nDuring the Cold War, Cuba managed to lessen the full impact of the U.S.\neconomic blockade by trading with Socialist bloc countries. With the Soviet\nUnion buying Cuban sugar, nickel ores, rum and tobacco at preferential prices,\nfrom 1960 to 1985, according to one expert, \u201cthe total amount of Soviet sugar\nsubsidies exceeded 22 billion dollars.\u201d In 1992, one year after the collapse\nof the Soviet Union plunged Cuba\u2019s economy into a major crisis known as the\n\u201cspecial period,\u201d U.S. filmmaker Jon Alpert asked Fidel Castro for a comment\non the economy. Castro\u2019s reply was simple: \u201cOur problem is the blockade and\nthe end of the Socialist Bloc,\u201d he said, \u201c85 percent of our commerce was with\nthe socialist countries.\u201d\n\nBy 1996, with the introduction of the Cuban Democracy Act and the Helms-Burton\nAct, the economic noose around Cuba tightened. Passed by Congress and enacted\nby President Bill Clinton, those acts established that any non-U.S. business\nthat deals with Cuba can be subjected to legal actions. In a report for the\nParliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, commenting on the Helms-\nBurton Act, Spanish politician Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez Laxe noted that the\n\u201cextraterritorial dimension of the legislation manifests itself in the fact\nthat third country companies can be sued in US courts, and their executives,\nalong with their families, barred from entering the United States.\u201d For\nGonz\u00e1lez Laxe, \u201cCanadian, European and Latin American companies and citizens\nwould be the most concerned.\u201d\n\nWhen President Barack Obama visited Cuba in 2016 and eased the blockade, one\ncommentator noted that: \u201cHistory\u2019s longest standing sanctions regime was not\ncompletely dismantled, but the progress was immense, with benefits seen almost\nimmediately by Cuban workers.\u201d The respite for Cubans, though, would be short\nlived.\n\nSalim Lamrani, author of numerous books on Cuba and a lecturer at the\nUniversity of La R\u00e9union, told Truthout that under Donald Trump, \u201cWashington\nreturned to the policy of confrontation and imposed 243 new sanctions in four\nyears, more than one sanction per week, targeting vital sectors of the Cuban\neconomy, such as the export of medical services, tourism and remittances.\u201d\nAmong those sanctions, Lamrani noted, \u201cFifty were imposed in the midst of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, depriving the island of vital equipment such as ventilators\nand severely affecting the health system.\u201d\n\nWorse, in 2021 the Trump administration put Cuba back on the list of states\nthat the U.S. accuses of sponsoring terrorism. Antoni Kapcia, professor\nemeritus at the University of Nottingham, told Truthout that while this move\nis \u201cnot supported by the European Union, Canada or the United Kingdom,\u201d it has\n\u201caffected European operations in Cuba, with European banks and insurance\ncompanies refusing to process payments to Cuban entities or to give insurance\ncover for stays in Cuba.\u201d According to Kapcia, placing Cuba on the list of\nstate sponsors of terrorism \u201cmade it even more difficult than it already was\nbefore 2017 for Cuba to buy and pay for imports (notably oil, medicines and\nfood products), contributing substantially to the deep worsening of the\neconomic situation.\u201d\n\nAsked to comment on why the Biden administration did not revert to Obama\u2019s\nprevious policies toward Cuba, Helen Yaffe, author of We Are Cuba! How a\nRevolutionary People Have Survived in a Post-Soviet World, told Truthout that,\nwhile \u201cinitially Biden did not make significant changes to the country\u2019s Cuba\npolicy\u201d after the protests of July 11, 2021, \u201cBiden was clearly advised that\nthe revolutionary state was vulnerable and close to collapse, and he wouldn\u2019t\nhave to do much to take the credit as the U.S. president who finally oversaw\nthe collapse of Cuban socialism.\u201d While, according to Yaffe, the idea that the\nstate was close to collapse is inaccurate, the Biden administration has\ndoubled down by adding some sanctions of its own.\n\nNow, with over 400,000 Cubans leaving the island between 2022 and late 2023,\nand the United States in an election year, Yaffe notes that Biden has taken\nsome measures to \u201creduce Cuban immigration to the U.S.,\u201d however, he has not\nremoved the \u201ccauses that drive that migration; that is the shortages and\nhardships largely caused by the U.S. blockade.\u201d According to the United\nNations, the six-decade U.S. financial and trade embargo on Cuba had cost the\nisland\u2019s economy $130 billion by 2018.\n\nThe despair and anger of Cubans citizens that Truthout spoke to is palpable.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a future for the population,\u201d said Asiel \u00c1lvarez, the\nconstruction worker from Havana. \u201cAnd in my case, I don\u2019t see a future.\u201d\n\nA 61-year-old former school teacher, Yolanda S\u00e1nchez preferred to speak to\nTruthout under a pseudonym, since she relies on the Cuban government to renew\nher licence to run a small bed and breakfast establishment in old Havana.\n\nS\u00e1nchez conceded that, \u201cDuring the presidency of Barack Obama, there was a\nflourishing in the Cuban economy and there were more opportunities to start\nbusinesses in the private sector, as well as the acquisition of basic\nnecessities for the people.\u201d In S\u00e1nchez\u2019s view, the COVID-19 pandemic was\ndisastrous, as was the government\u2019s timing shortly afterwards in making the\nmonetary changes it made.\n\nShe states that the \u201cwhole system collapsed\u201d while the cost of everything\nincreased: \u201cfood, medicine, housing, environmental hygiene.\u201d From S\u00e1nchez\u2019s\nperspective, inflation has not stopped while the \u201cstate itself has increased\nthe price of basic necessities.\u201d\n\nCarlos Rivera is 40-year-old health care worker at a public hospital in\nHavana, who also requested to use a pseudonym. For Rivera:\n\n> Today there is no end to the crisis, we don\u2019t know where all this is going\n> to end. We see that hospitals are being silenced, when health services are\n> an important source of foreign currency for the country and are not even\n> capable of at least improving the working conditions of those who work in\n> that sector. The oil crisis, on the other hand, is hitting us hard. The\n> issue of transport is very serious.\n\nAccording to Rivera, people in Havana can spend up to three hours waiting for\npublic transport \u2014 time they wish they could use for other purposes.\n\nCommunicating with Truthout, Iram\u00eds Rosique C\u00e1rdenas \u2014 a Cuban journalist from\nthe Cuba-based media collective La Tizza \u2014 said \u201cright now, there is also a\nstrong problem of supply of the regulated basic basket (a subsidized food\nbag), for example, the April rice, a staple food, has not arrived.\u201d In his\nview, \u201cthe future of our world is uncertain\u201d as \u201cany opportunity for the\nfuture for us depends on Cuba being able to complete its insertion in the\nworld market (with all that this will imply for better and for worse),\nsomething that the economic war to which we are subjected prevents.\u201d\n\nFor Fulton Armstrong, a senior fellow of the Latin American program at\nAmerican University in Washington and a former member of the National\nIntelligence Council (NIC) which reported to the CIA, despite factors like the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, Venezuela\u2019s economic crisis and the Cuban government\u2019s own\neconomic errors and lack of reforms, the number one factor in the island\u2019s\ncurrent woes remains the U.S. economic blockade. Speaking recently to the\nGerman public broadcaster DW, Armstrong noted that while some protests against\nthe Cuban government have been spontaneous expressions of people\u2019s\nfrustrations, others have been carefully planned and supported by external\nactors thorough the use of social media and bot accounts. The National\nEndowment for Democracy, according to Armstrong, is one such actor interested\nin seeing the overthrow of the Cuban government \u2014 having spent $600 million\nover the years on \u201cpromoting democracy\u201d (i.e. trying to overthrow the current\nCuban political system) on the island.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the United States promoted similar campaigns against the\nCuban revolution. After the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, Washington\nignored blatant acts of terrorism committed by elements of the Cuban hard\nright exile community in Miami, Florida, up through the 1997 Cuba hotel\nbombings (the last acts of terrorism against the island). In 1971, the CIA and\nan anti-Castro group were accused of having introduced African swine fever\nvirus into the island, which resulted in the forced slaughter of 500,000 pigs\nto prevent a full-scale animal epidemic.\n\nIn 2017, the Cuban government claimed \u201ca balance of 3,478 deaths and 2,099\ndisabled persons\u201d due to acts of terrorism against Cuba \u201cfor defending its\nindependence, sovereignty and dignity.\u201d\n\nAccording to Fabi\u00e1n Escalante Font, founder of the Cuban intelligence services\nand ex-head of the Cuban State Security Department, from the early 1960s to\n2000, Cuban authorities also registered 637 assassination plots against Fidel\nCastro.\n\nStill, throughout this campaign of violence toward the island, brutal economic\nsanctions have remained the core of U.S. policy towards Cuba. Now, 62 years\nafter the U.S. first imposed the blockade, it appears that some of the more\nwidespread societal breakdown that the U.S. has tried for decades to foment\nmay be at risk of taking hold.\n\nFor those familiar with the achievements of the Cuban revolution and the often\nwidespread abysmal economic conditions for most peoples of the Caribbean and\nLatin America, a collapse of Cuban society would be highly regrettable. For\naverage Cubans, it would be catastrophic.\n\nIn 2022, Newsweek noted that the average Cuban was still living three years\nlonger than the average citizen from the United States, whose life expectancy\nat birth was 76.1 years. In 2016, when Fidel Castro died at the age of 90,\nanother press article noted Cuba\u2019s achievements in the field of medicine,\nwhich included being the first country to eliminate HIV transmission from\nmother to child, lower infant mortality rates and developing a lung cancer\nvaccine.\n\nIn 2000, Cuban educator Leonela Relys D\u00edaz developed the Yo, s\u00ed puedo (Yes, I\ncan) literacy program which, by 2014, had helped 6 million people learn how to\nread and write in 28 different countries \u2014 including Aboriginal communities in\nAustralia.\n\nGlobal corporations and Cuban American hard right lobby groups in Miami,\nFlorida, are all eager to reassert their dominance on the island. Were the\nCuban Revolution to collapse, one would struggle to see such achievements\nsurvive.\n\n##### Join us in defending the truth before it\u2019s too late\n\nThe future of independent journalism is uncertain, and the consequences of\nlosing it are too grave to ignore.
