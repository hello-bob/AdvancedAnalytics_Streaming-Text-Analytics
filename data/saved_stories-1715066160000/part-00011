These findings could inform\ntargeted therapeutic approaches, potentially improving treatment outcomes for\nalcohol use disorder.\n\nKey Facts:\n\n  1. Gender Differences in Brain Response: Men and women show different brain responses to alcohol-related and stress cues, with women experiencing more uniform craving responses to both types of cues.\n  2. Future Drinking Predictors: Brain regions associated with anxiety in women and stress arousal in men were predictors of future heavy drinking, highlighting potential targets for intervention.\n  3. Implications for Treatment: The study supports the development of gender-specific treatments for alcohol use disorder, which could address the unique neural and psychological mechanisms at play in each sex.\n\nSource: Yale\n\nThe brain circuits that underlie alcohol craving and heavy drinking share some\nsimilarities between men and women, but also some key differences, a new Yale\nstudy reveals.\n\nUsing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), Yale researchers have\nobserved that after viewing stress- or alcohol-related images (as opposed to\n\u201cneutral\u201d images), the brains of men and women with alcohol use disorder\nresponded differently.\n\nThose differences, which were also related to alcohol craving intensity and\nfuture alcohol use, may signal the need for sex-specific therapeutic\napproaches to alcohol use disorder.\n\nThe findings were published May 6 in the American Journal of Psychiatry.\n\nPrevious research has shown that individuals with alcohol use disorder who\nexperience strong cravings for alcohol\u2014the overpowering desire to consume\nalcohol\u2014are more likely to relapse into heavy drinking. Researchers have also\nshown that craving can be triggered by stressful life events and alcohol-\nrelated cues, such as seeing other people drinking alcohol.\n\nWhat has been less clear is whether these patterns are the same in men and\nwomen. But there had been growing evidence to suggest they might not be, says\nRajita Sinha, the Foundations Fund Professor of Psychiatry at Yale School of\nMedicine and senior author of the study.\n\n\u201cIn the last two decades, there has been a very steep increase in binge\ndrinking among women in the United States, much more so than in men,\u201d said\nSinha.\n\n\u201cThat has led to a lot more concern for the comorbidities associated with\nalcohol use disorder, such as liver disease, cardiovascular issues, and cancer\nrisk. So we set out to see if stress- and cue-related craving is different in\nmen and women.\u201d\n\nFor the study, Sinha and her colleagues recruited 77 treatment-seeking adults\n(46 men and 31 women) with alcohol use disorder. While undergoing fMRI\nscanning, the participants viewed images that depicted either stressful\nscenes, such as someone with a gunshot wound; alcohol-related images, like\npeople at a bar; or \u201cneutral\u201d images, such as waterfalls or mountains. The\nparticipants rated their level of stress and alcohol craving after each image.\n\n\u201cWe found that women reported greater levels of stress after viewing the\nstress cues than did men,\u201d said Sinha, \u201cFurther, while alcohol cues led to\nstronger craving in men than the stress cues did, in women, stress and alcohol\ncues led to the same amount of craving in women.\u201d\n\nWhen the researchers looked at brain function while the participants viewed\nthe images, they found that brain circuits\u2014particularly those found to be\nconnected to emotion, reward, regulation of stress and emotion, and impulse\ncontrol\u2014responded differently in men and women.\n\n\u201cIn women, those circuits were clearly blunted, but in men they were\nhyperactive,\u201d said Sinha. \u201cSo the disruption is there in both but in different\nways.\u201d\n\nMost of the participants (72) went on to complete an eight-week behavioral\nalcohol use treatment program and reported daily if and how much alcohol they\nconsumed. While there were no differences between men and women in how often\nthey engaged in heavy drinking, the brain regions correlated with future heavy\ndrinking were different across sexes.\n\n\u201cIn women, disruptions in brain regions associated with anxiety were related\nto future heavy drinking,\u201d said Sinha. \u201cBut in men it was disruptions in areas\nlinked to high stress arousal.\u201d\n\nThese sex differences in craving and its underlying neural correlates suggest\nmen and women may benefit from targeted therapeutic approaches, said the\nresearchers. Those could include both pharmacological and behavioral\ntreatments.\n\nIn general, more consideration of the experiential, biological, and\ndemographic variability across individuals will lead to better treatments for\nalcohol use disorder and many other illnesses, said Sinha.\n\n\u201cWe want these types of studies in order to get clues on processes that drive\nheavy drinking and what type of interventions might work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can\nbe a very critical component of novel treatment development and better\noutcomes.\u201d\n\n## About this alcohol use disorder and neuroscience research news\n\nAuthor: Mallory Locklear Source: Yale Contact: Mallory Locklear \u2013 Yale Image:\nThe image is credited to Neuroscience News\n\nOriginal Research: Closed access. \u201cNeural Correlates of Stress and Alcohol\nCue-Induced Alcohol Craving and of Future Heavy Drinking: Evidence of Sex\nDifferences\u201d by Milena Radoman et al. American Journal of Psychiatry\n\nAbstract\n\nNeural Correlates of Stress and Alcohol Cue-Induced Alcohol Craving and of\nFuture Heavy Drinking: Evidence of Sex Differences\n\n### Objective:\n\nStress and alcohol cue reactivity are associated with poor treatment outcomes\nin alcohol use disorder (AUD), but sex-specific neural correlates of stress\nand alcohol cue\u2013induced craving compared with neutral cue\u2013induced craving and\nof heavy drinking outcomes in AUD have not been examined. Thus, this study\nprospectively examined these associations and assessed sex differences.\n\n### Methods:\n\nTreatment-seeking adults with AUD (N=77; 46 men and 31 women) completed a\nfunctional MRI task involving stress, alcohol, and neutral cue exposure with\nrepeated assessments of alcohol craving. Most of these participants (N=72; 43\nmen and 29 women) then participated in an 8-week standardized behavioral AUD\ntreatment program, during which the percentage of heavy drinking days was\nassessed.\n\n### Results:\n\nSignificant increases in both stress and alcohol cue\u2013induced craving relative\nto neutral cue\u2013induced craving were observed, with a greater alcohol-neutral\ncontrast in craving relative to the stress-neutral contrast among men and\nequivalent stress-neutral and alcohol-neutral contrasts in craving among\nwomen.\n\nWhole-brain voxel-based regression analyses showed craving-associated\nhyperactivation in the neutral condition, but hypoactive prefrontal\n(ventromedial and lateral prefrontal, supplementary motor, and anterior\ncingulate regions) and striatal responses during exposure to stressful images\n(stress-neutral contrast) and alcohol cues (alcohol-neutral contrast), with\nsignificant sex differences.\n\nAdditionally, a higher percentage of heavy drinking days was associated with\nhypoactivation of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and the bed nucleus\nof the stria terminalis in the stress-neutral contrast among women,\nhyperactivation of the hypothalamus in the stress-neutral contrast among men,\nand hyperactivation of the hippocampus in the alcohol-neutral contrast among\nmen.\n\n### Conclusions:\n\nSex differences in stress- and alcohol cue-induced responses in the cortico-\nstriatal-limbic network related to subjective alcohol craving and to heavy\ndrinking indicated that distinct brain circuits underlie alcohol use outcomes\nin women and men. These findings underscore the need for sex-specific\ntherapeutics to address this neural dysfunction effectively.\n\nTags\n\nalcoholalcohol use disorderAUDbrain researchneurobiologyNeuroscienceYale\n\nShareTweetShareShareSubmitEmail\n\nNeuroscience News\n\nNeuroscience News posts science research news from labs, universities,\nhospitals and news departments around the world.
