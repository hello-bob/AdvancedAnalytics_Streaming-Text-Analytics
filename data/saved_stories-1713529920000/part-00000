But even though I\u2019ve been focusing on scary happenings\noverseas, I\u2019m still very optimistic about the domestic situation here in the\nUnited States. So I thought I\u2019d make a little list of trends that we should be\nhappy about.\n\nFirst, the big picture. 2020 and 2021 were pretty dark years for the U.S. in\nmany ways \u2014 not in all ways, but in many. Covid killed a million Americans,\nthere was massive social unrest, violent crime skyrocketed across the nation,\nand in 2021 inflation soared and real income fell. There were some good things\ngoing on too \u2014 Covid relief spending allowed a lot of people to pay down their\ndebts, and the economy rebounded strongly in 2021 \u2014 but overall, if you said\nthat 2020-21 were bad years, reasonable people probably wouldn\u2019t contradict\nyou. I still expressed optimism during those years, but more of the \u201cWe can\nfix it\u201d variety rather than the \u201cThings are going great\u201d variety.\n\nThose years, and the years of unrest that preceded them in the late 2010s,\ncemented a negative mood in the minds of the American people that will take a\nwhile to heal. But the healing is underway, because there are a bunch of\npositive trends going on in the nation right now. Here are a few.\n\n####\n\nCrime is going down now\n\nViolent crime is a huge problem in America today \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s pretty much\nalways a huge problem in America, since this is generally a very violent\ncountry. But in the 1990s, 2000s, and early 2010s things were getting steadily\nless bad.\n\n(Just as a side note, I like to use murder rates as a proxy for overall\nviolent crime \u2014 assault, robbery, and rape are subject to underreporting. If\nthere\u2019s a lot of assaults happening, people might just stop calling the cops\nwhen they get punched, but everyone calls the cops for a dead body. So I use\nmurder to measure overall violent crime. Also, I often just say \u201ccrime\u201d when I\nmean \u201cviolent crime\u201d, because many other people use this shorthand.)\n\nViolent crime hit a low point in 2014. But in 2015, it started drifting up\nagain, and in 2020 it absolutely spiked. Many, including myself, feared that\nAmerica was entering a long-term period of elevated urban violence, like we\ndid in the 1970s.\n\nBut starting in 2022, something good started to happen \u2014 violence started to\nfall. It fell even more in 2023:\n\nSource: Axios\n\nAnd the trend looks like it\u2019s continuing, or even accelerating, in 2024. The\nWall Street Journal has a great table where you can look at changes in murder\nrates in various cities over the last year. In most cities, murders are\nfalling, and in some places they\u2019re absolutely plunging:\n\nSource: WSJ\n\nAmerica is becoming safer. Why? Unfortunately, as with the big crime decline\nthat started in the early 1990s, we\u2019ll probably never know. Changes in\npolicing and incarceration, the good economy, and falling social unrest are\nall possibilities.\n\nBut the good news here is that the country seems to be getting safer. If the\ntrend continues, we could get back to the relatively good years of the early\n2010s.\n\n####\n\nWe\u2019re making progress against climate change\n\nOne thing that gets many Americans depressed \u2014 especially many young\nprogressive Americans \u2014 is climate change. And that\u2019s understandable! Climate\nchange is a huge threat to our way of life, not to mention the natural world.\nThe last year was especially brutal.\n\nThere\u2019s an inherent difficulty in solving climate change, since it\u2019s an\nexternality \u2014 climate policy is made at the level of individual countries, so\neach country has an incentive to sit back and do nothing and insist that the\nother countries handle the global problem.\n\nBut there\u2019s another powerful force working against climate change: technology.\nSolar power, batteries, and other green technologies have gotten cheaper at\nastounding rates, to the point where decarbonization is the smart economic\noption as well as the good environmental choice. At the same time, economic\ngrowth is generally shifting from manufacturing to services, especially online\nservices, which are less carbon-intensive.\n\nAs a result, emissions have been falling in the developed world, and\ndecelerating across much of the developing world:\n\nSource: Nat Bullard\n\nAnd as a result, projections for how bad climate change will get have been\nfalling for the last six or seven years:\n\nSource: Cipher\n\nObviously much more needs to be done. 2.7 degrees of warming will be pretty\ncatastrophic for a lot of people and places, and even 2.1 degrees will be\ndifficult to live with. Electrification and decarbonization need to\naccelerate.\n\nBut still, this is big progress, on a huge, important, and potentially even\nexistential issue.\n\n####\n\nThe U.S. economy is growing pretty fast\n\nA lot of people these days like to downplay the importance of GDP, but\nactually it\u2019s a very important economic number. GDP is a measure of national\nincome \u2014 the amount that people spend on goods and services is, theoretically\nspeaking, the same as the amount that people earn (even if in practice there\nare small differences between these numbers when we measure them). We want\npeople\u2019s incomes to go up! That means GDP growth. Also, faster GDP growth\nmeans more people have jobs.\n\nU.S. growth has actually been pretty average since the pandemic; it\u2019s\nbasically staying on the trend line of previous decades.\n\nBut when you look at international comparisons, America is actually doing\nreally well. Most countries have struggled to grow at pre-pandemic rates in\nthe post-pandemic era \u2014 this is especially true of European countries that\nsuffered from the Russian gas cutoff, but it\u2019s also true of places like Japan\nand Canada (and even China). The U.S. has powered ahead, even when you take\nhigher immigration rates into account:\n\n(Note: This is not a per capita measure, but since most population growth in\nrich countries is now due to immigration, it\u2019s basically the same.)\n\nAnd forecasters expect the U.S. to continue to outpace other rich countries\nthis year as well.\n\nWhy is the U.S. growing so quickly? Two commonly cited reasons are 1) the\nU.S.\u2019 expansionary fiscal policy, including more generous Covid relief\npayments, and 2) Biden\u2019s industrial policy, which is causing a boom in factory\nconstruction.\n\nBut I would also like to point out allocative efficiency. The U.S. economy got\nvery shaken up by Covid; a lot of businesses were destroyed, and there was a\nhuge boom in new businesses. Americans also moved around the country a lot\nmore than they had been doing in previous years. That churn results in a\nbetter allocation of productive resources \u2014 crappy old businesses die and\nbetter ones replace them, while workers move to jobs and places where their\ntalents are put to better use.\n\nIn any case, American income is growing strongly. And there\u2019s even better\nnews: The higher income is flowing into the pockets of young Americans and the\nworking class.\n\n####\n\nYounger generations are doing better than their parents\n\nI\u2019ve written several posts about this over the past year, but the positive\ndata keeps coming in, and it\u2019s good to go over it again.\n\nIn the 2010s, there was a big worry that the Millennial generation, and\nperhaps also Generation Z, would be uniquely hurt by the financial crisis and\nby other negative economic trends. But in the years since the pandemic, it\u2019s\nbecome apparent that younger generations are \u2014 on average \u2014 doing very well\neconomically. The Economist has a good story showing generational income gains\nby age:\n\nSource: The Economist\n\nNote that this chart is adjusted for changes in the cost of living over time.\n\nAnd Jeremy Horpedahl has been tracking younger generations\u2019 wealth gains over\nat his blog:\n\nSource: Jeremy Horpedahl\n\nThere are two basic reasons for the jump in the wealth of younger generations:\n1) rising house prices, and 2) falling debt levels.\n\nNow, these are averages, not medians. It\u2019s reasonable to worry about\ninequality within the younger generation, especially regarding who gets to\ninherit an expensive house from their parents. But from 2019 to 2022, there\nwere big increases in Millennials\u2019 median wealth, not just average:\n\nSource: FRB\n\nThe changes were especially good for traditionally disadvantaged groups \u2014\nBlack and Hispanic Americans, Americans without a college degree, rural\nAmericans, renters, etc. So that suggests that the surge in the wealth of the\nyounger generation isn\u2019t flowing disproportionately to richer young people (as\nit might be in the UK).\n\nSo young Americans are doing well \u2014 they\u2019re making more than their parents did\nat similar ages, and their wealth is higher too, despite spending more years\nin school and getting a later start on their careers.\n\n####\n\nWage inequality is falling\n\nInequality in America increased a lot in the 1980s, then again in the 2000s\nand early 2010s. By far the biggest piece of this was increased wage\ninequality \u2014 some people earned a lot more, others saw their wages fall. There\nwere huge debates over what caused this \u2014 the decline of unions, competition\nwith China, automation, changes in the tax code, or the rise of new\ntechnologies that benefitted educated workers more than others.\n\nBut in the mid 2010s, wage inequality plateaued:\n\nSource: realtimeinequality.org\n\nAnd since the pandemic, this trend has accelerated. Autor, Dube, and McGrew\nhave a recent paper titled \u201cThe Unexpected Compression: Competition at Work in\nthe Low Wage Labor Market\u201d, in which they document how low-wage and medium-\nwage workers have seen big gains since 2019, while high-wage workers have lost\na bit of ground. They cite the reallocation of labor as the biggest factor \u2014\nnow that Americans are switching jobs a lot more, low-wage workers are able to\ndrive a harder bargain against their employers.\n\nIn fact, Jeremy Horpedahl has my favorite chart showing the real wage gains\n(i.e., adjusted for the cost of living) across the distribution:\n\nSource: Jeremy Horpedahl\n\nIt would be nice if the top fifth had gained as well, but the strong gains for\nthe people at the bottom are something to celebrate.\n\nSo those are five recent trends to be optimistic about in America today. We\nhave a healthy economy, which is finally delivering on its promise to low-wage\nworkers and young people, both in terms of greater income and greater wealth.\nCrime is falling, and the threat of global warming is a little less dire. If\nthat doesn\u2019t make you smile on a Thursday afternoon...well, I did my best.\n\nShare\n\n193 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n24 Restacks\n\n193\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Five things to be optimistic about in America today\n\nwww.noahpinion.blog\n\n105\n\nShare\n\n105 Comments\n\nNeeraj Krishnan11 hrs agoLiked by Noah SmithAnd a sixth, the Noahpinion blog.\nIt brings some measure of joy :)Expand full commentLike (9)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 reply by Noah Smith\n\nLuis Augusto Fretes Cuevas7 hrs agoLiked by Noah SmithMy sixth thing is that\nYIMBYs are gaining momentum and achieving victories.Expand full commentLike\n(8)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n103 more comments...\n\nYou're not going to like what comes after Pax Americana\n\nWelcome to the jungle.\n\nOct 7, 2023 \u2022\n\nNoah Smith\n\n956\n\nShare this post\n\n#### You're not going to like what comes after Pax Americana\n\nwww.noahpinion.blog\n\n335\n\nWestern leftists have lost the plot\n\nGleeful support for the massacre of innocents is simply inhumane.\n\nOct 10, 2023 \u2022\n\nNoah Smith\n\n1,161\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Western leftists have lost the plot\n\nwww.noahpinion.blog\n\n197\n\nBlue states don't build\n\nThe cost of stasis: population loss, homelessness, and reliance on fossil\nfuels.\n\nDec 28, 2023 \u2022\n\nNoah Smith\n\n423\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Blue states don't build\n\nwww.noahpinion.blog\n\n181\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Noah Smith\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
