David Robson explains how to avoid the\nmost common traps of sloppy thinking.\n\nIf you ever doubt the idea that the very clever can also be very silly, just\nremember the time the smartest man in America tried to electrocute a turkey.\nBenjamin Franklin had been attempting to capture \u201celectrical fire\u201d in glass\njars as a primitive battery. Having succeeded, he thought it\u2019d be impressive\nto use the discharge to kill and roast his dinner. Soon it became a regular\nparty trick, as he wowed guests with his magical ability to command this\nstrange force.\n\nDuring one of these demonstrations, however, Franklin became distracted, and\nmade an elementary mistake \u2013 he touched one of the live jars while holding a\nmetal chain in the other hand. \u201cThe company present... say that the flash was\nvery great and the crack as loud as a pistol,\u201d he later wrote. \u201cI then felt\nwhat I know not how well to describe; a universal blow thro'out my whole body\nfrom head to foot which seem'd within as well as without; after which the\nfirst thing I took notice of was a violent quick shaking of my body.\u201d\n\nClearly, intelligence doesn\u2019t mean that you are more rational or sensible \u2013 a\nfact that we\u2019ve explored before on BBC Future. Although it is easy to laugh at\nFranklin\u2019s eccentricity, the other examples are sobering. The American surgeon\nAtul Gawande has written powerfully about a great tragedy in modern medicine.\nDespite their astonishing skill, surgeons can cause the needless loss of life\nthrough sheer carelessness \u2013 something as simple as forgetting to wash their\nhands or apply a clean dressing. In business, short-sighted thinking might\ninvolve cutting corners that eventually lead to the downfall of a company.\n\nA new way to think\n\nThe problem, says Robert Sternberg at Cornell University, is that our\neducation system is not designed to teach us to think in a way that is useful\nfor the rest of life. \u201cThe tests we use \u2013 the SATs or A-levels in England \u2013\nare very modest predictors of anything besides school grades,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\nsee people who get very good grades, and then they suck at leadership. They\nare good technicians with no common sense, and no ethics. They get to be the\npresident or vice-president of corporations and societies and they are\nmassively incompetent.\u201d\n\nWhat can be done? Sternberg and others are now campaigning for a new kind of\neducation that teaches people how to think more effectively, alongside more\ntraditional academic tasks. Their insights could help all of us \u2013 whatever our\nintelligence \u2013 to be a little less stupid:\n\n1\\. Recognise your blind spots\n\nThinkstock\n\n(Credit: Thinkstock)\n\nLike Hanna-Barbera\u2019s Yogi, do you secretly think \u201cyou\u2019re smarter than the\naverage bear\u201d? Don\u2019t we all. It\u2019s something called \u201cillusory superiority\u201d,\nand, as Yogi shows, it\u2019s particularly inflated among the least able. In your\ndefence, you might claim that you know you\u2019re smart because of your report\ncards, or that impressive performance at a pub quiz. If so, you might be\nsuffering from \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d \u2013 the tendency to only pick evidence to\nsupport your viewpoint. Still unconvinced? Then psychologists would claim that\nyou are suffering from the \u201cbias blind-spot\u201d \u2013 a tendency to deny flaws in\nyour own thinking.\n\nThe fact is that we all suffer from some subconscious biases, clouding\neverything from the decision to buy a house to your views on the conflict in\nCrimea. Fortunately, psychologists are finding that people can be trained to\nspot them. There are about a 100 to consider, so start swotting up with this\ncomprehensive list.\n\nWe all suffer from subconscious biases\n\n2\\. Be ready to eat humble pie\n\nThinkstock\n\n(Credit: Thinkstock)\n\n\u201cA man should never be ashamed to own he has been in the wrong, which is but\nsaying, in other words, that he is wiser today than he was yesterday,\u201d wrote\nthe 18th Century poet Alexander Pope. To psychologists today, that kind of\nthinking is considered a core personality trait known as \u201copen-mindedness\u201d.\nAmong other things, it measures how easily you deal with uncertainty, and how\nquickly and willingly you will change your mind based on new evidence. It\u2019s a\ntrait that some people find surprisingly hard to cultivate, yet the moment of\nself-deflation pays off in the long term. For example, Philip Tetlock at the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania is currently asking ordinary people to predict the\ncourse of complex political events in a four-year contest. He has found that\nthe best forecasters depended just as much on open-mindedness as a high IQ.\n\nIntellectual humility comes in many other forms \u2013 but at its centre is the\nability to question the limits of your knowledge. On what assumptions are you\nbasing your decision? How verifiable are they? What additional information\nshould you hunt out to make a more balanced viewpoint? Have you looked at\nexamples of similar situations for comparison? Going through those steps may\nseem elementary, but consider this: with that simple training, many of\nTetlock\u2019s subjects managed to beat the forecasts of professional intelligence\nagents, who were perhaps less ready to own up to their ignorance.\n\n3\\. Argue with yourself \u2013 and don\u2019t pull the punches\n\nThinkstock\n\n(Credit: Thinkstock)\n\nThinkstock\n\n(Credit: Thinkstock)\n\nOne of Sternberg\u2019s biggest issues with the education system is that we are not\ntaught to use our smarts to be practical, or creative. Even if we aren\u2019t\nschooled through rote memorisation any more, many teachers still don\u2019t\nnecessarily train the kind of flexibility needed in most of real life. One way\nto develop those skills could be to re-imagine key events. History students\ncould write an essay exploring \u201cWhat would the world be like if Germany had\nwon World War Two?\u201d or \u201cWhat would have happened if Britain had permanently\nabolished the monarchy in the 17th Century?\u201d. If history isn\u2019t your thing,\nwriting a story imagining \u201cThe day the president quit\u201d or \u201cThe day my wife\ndisappeared\u201d could be a starting point.\n\nIt may sound fanciful, but the point is that it forces you to consider the\ndifferent eventualities and form hypotheses. Young children help hone that\nkind of \u201ccounterfactual thinking\u201d when they play pretend, which helps them to\nlearn everything from the laws of physics to social skills. We don\u2019t tend to\npractise it deliberately as an adult \u2013 but you might find that it helps\nbroaden your mindset when grappling with the unexpected.\n\n5\\. Don\u2019t underestimate the checklist\n\nThinkstock\n\n(Credit: Thinkstock)\n\nAs Benjamin Franklin\u2019s mishap demonstrates, distraction and absent-mindedness\ncan be the downfall of the best of us. When wrestling with complex situations,\nit is easy to forget the basics \u2013 which is why Gawande is a passionate\nadvocate of checklists as a gentle reminder. At the Johns Hopkins Hospital,\nfor instance, a list of five bullet points reminding doctors of basic hygiene\nreduced 10-day infection rates from 11% to 0%. A similar checklist for pilots,\nreminding them of the basic procedures for take-off and landing, seemed to\nhalve American pilot deaths during World War Two.\n\nAs Gawande points out, these were professionals with the greatest skill and\ncutting-edge technology \u2013 yet a simple piece of paper ended up saving so many\nlives. Whatever your profession, those facts are worth considering before you\nassume that you know it all already.\n\nPractice these steps, and you might just find that you start to find talents\nthat were previously unrecognised.\n\nIf you are looking for inspiration, consider Sternberg. As a child at\nelementary school, he flunked an IQ test and generally failed to impress\nacademically. \u201cAll my teachers thought I was stupid \u2013 and I thought I was\nstupid.\u201d He might have bombed out of school, had he not later found a mentor\nwho realised there was more to smart thinking than abstract problems, and\nencouraged him to train his mind more broadly. Thanks to that support, he is\nnow a professor at Cornell.\n\n\u201cIntelligence isn\u2019t a score on an IQ test \u2013 it\u2019s the ability to figure what\nyou want in life and finding ways to achieve that,\u201d he says \u2013 even if that\ninvolves some painful self-awareness of your own follies.\n\nShare this story on Facebook, Google+ or Twitter.\n\nPsychology\n\nBrain\n\nRelated\n\n## What was behind the garrotting panics of London?\n\n6 days ago\n\nLondon\n\n## Why it can be hard to accept compliments\n\n4 Apr 2024\n\nFuture\n\n## The transcendent effects of the eclipse\n\n4 Apr 2024\n\nFuture\n\nMore\n\n4 days ago\n\n## Daniel Dennett: 'Civilisation is fragile'\n\nBefore his recent death, the influential philosopher Daniel Dennett spoke to\nthe BBC about why he saw new dangers from AI.\n\n4 days ago\n\nFuture\n\n17 Apr 2024\n\n## Why Musk's Neuralink 'extends the mind's borders'\n\nWhen we merge mind and machine, the traditional borders of the self dissipate,\nsays philosopher Dvija Mehta.\n\n17 Apr 2024\n\nFuture\n\n17 Apr 2024\n\n## Girl, 8, has world-first brain surgery\n\nA girl from Cheshire is receiving pioneering treatment for dystonia, a\nlifelong neurological condition.\n\n17 Apr 2024\n\nLiverpool\n\n13 Apr 2024\n\n## Gallery project shows how art affects the brain\n\nHeadsets will allow visitors to Watts Gallery in Guildford to see how they\nenjoy art.\n\n13 Apr 2024\n\nSurrey\n\n10 Apr 2024\n\n## Long Covid work uses computer games to help memory\n\nThe University of Exeter study utilises earlier research into the mental\ndecline of older people.\n\n10 Apr 2024\n\nDevon\n\n## Let us know you agree to cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best online experience.\n\nPlease let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.\n\n  * No, take me to settings\n\n", "frontpage": false}
