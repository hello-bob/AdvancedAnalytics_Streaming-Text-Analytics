Directed by\nGary Hustwit, it was released in 2007 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of\nthe typeface's introduction in 1957 and is considered the first of the Design\nTrilogy by the director.\n\n## Synopsis[edit]\n\nHelvetica is a documentary that interviews many graphic designers involved in\nthe history or modern usage of the Helvetica typeface. The initial interviews\ndiscuss the original creator Eduard Hoffmann, and his goals for creating a\nclean, legible type relating to the ideals of the Modernist movement.\nDesigners also point out typographic \"bad habits\" from earlier works around\nthe 1950s which Helvetica tried to fix. For example, illegible hand-made\nlettering and cramped cursive.\n\nThroughout the film, various montages of Helvetica appearing in urban scenes\nand pop culture intersperse the interviews.\n\nLater, other interviewers point out criticisms of Helvetica. For example,\nStefan Sagmeister believes that the typeface is too boring and limiting. David\nCarson, author of The End of Print: The Grafik Design of David Carson, (1995)\nemphasizes the difference between legibility and good communication. He states\nthat a hand-drawn font may be intentionally harder to read, to communicate\nemphasis to the reader. Other designers dislike Helvetica on the grounds of\nideology. They instead prefer hand-illustrated typefaces centered around\nPostmodernism, and rejecting conformity.\n\nSeveral interviews, including one of Michael Place, reveal a third stance on\nHelvetica. These designers-interviewees embrace its ubiquity and the challenge\nof making it \"speak in a different way\". Another high profile interview\nfeatures Massimo Vignelli, who is responsible for the creation of directional\nsigns for the New York City subway system.^[1] He too offers a nuanced\nposition on the success and prominence of the typeface.\n\nThe film concludes with comments on the increasing prevalence of graphic\ndesign as self expression, citing the social media website Myspace, and its\nfeature allowing users to fully customize the styling of their page.\n\n## Interviewees[edit]\n\n  * Manfred Schulz\n  * Massimo Vignelli\n  * Rick Poynor\n  * Wim Crouwel\n  * Matthew Carter\n  * Alfred Hoffmann, Eduard Hoffmann's son\n  * Mike Parker Linotype's typographic development director.\n  * Otmar Hoefer\n  * Bruno Steinert\n  * Hermann Zapf\n  * Michael Bierut\n  * Leslie Savan\n  * Tobias Frere-Jones\n  * Jonathan Hoefler\n  * Erik Spiekermann\n  * Neville Brody\n  * Lars M\u00fcller Archived 2 May 2010 at the Wayback Machine\n  * Paula Scher\n  * Stefan Sagmeister\n  * David Carson\n  * Experimental Jetset\n  * Michael C.

What they do is more than just logos and\ncorporate branding - they design the type that we read every day in newspapers\nand magazines, onscreen and on television. Fonts don't just appear out of\nMicrosoft Word: there are human beings and huge stories behind them.\"^[2]\n\n## Release[edit]\n\nHelvetica premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival in March 2007. The\nfilm toured around the world for screenings in selected venues, such as the\nIFC Center in New York, the Institute of Contemporary Arts London, the Gene\nSiskel Film Center in Chicago, and the Roxie Cinema in San Francisco.\nHelvetica was nominated for the 2008 Independent Spirit's Truer than Fiction\nAward.\n\nBands and musicians that contributed to the documentary's soundtrack include\nFour Tet, The Album Leaf, Kim Hiorth\u00f8y, Caribou, Battles, Sam Prekop of The\nSea and Cake, and El Ten Eleven.\n\nAn edited version of the film was broadcast in the UK on BBC One in November\n2007, as part of Alan Yentob's Imagine series. It aired in January 2009 as\npart of the Independent Lens series on PBS in the United States.\n\n### Critical reception[edit]\n\nThe New York Sun editor Steve Dollar claimed the movie was \"more compelling\nthan might be imagined.\"^[3]\n\nTime Out editor David Jenkins calls the movie \"...artfully photographed,\nsharply edited and propelled by a gorgeous ambient rock soundtrack...\"\n\n### Awards and nominations[edit]\n\nIn 2008, the documentary was nominated for \"Truer Than Fiction Award\" during\nthe Independent Spirit Awards.\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\nThe film was released on DVD in November 2007 by Plexifilm.\n\nThe film was released on Blu-ray Disc in May 2008, produced by Matt Grady of\nPlexifilm.
