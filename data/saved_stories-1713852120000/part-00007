The\nacquisition, finalized on December 17 last year, was quietly conducted but\nnoted in a European Commission filing spotted by French publication Challenges\n(via iPhoneSoft). While the financial details of the transaction remain\nundisclosed, the move is almost certainly part of Apple's broader strategy to\nbring more sophisticated AI technology to its devices, such as those expected\nto be introduced in iOS 18.\n\nThe company was established in 2016 by Xavier and Lucas Fischer and made\nsignificant strides in AI technology focusing on low-power, high-efficiency\ndeep learning algorithms that function without relying on cloud-based systems.\nThis approach aligns with Apple's oft-touted commitment to user privacy, data\nsecurity, and reliable performance, as processing data locally minimizes the\nrisk of data breaches and ensures faster processing times. The startup's\nexpertise in compressing neural networks to work effectively on portable\ndevices like smartphones and tablets is likely a key factor in Apple's\ninterest.\n\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman recently reported that Apple's LLM will run entirely\non-device, rather than via the cloud like most existing AI services. Apple's\nAI tools may be less capable in certain instances than its direct cloud-based\nrivals, but Gurman suggested that the company could \"fill in the gaps\" by\nlicensing technology from Google and other AI service providers.\n\nBefore its acquisition, Datakalab engaged in various high-profile projects,\nincluding collaborations with the French government and Disney. The company\ndeveloped technology capable of analyzing human emotions by facial recognition\nand visual data, which were later used to monitor audience reactions in real-\ntime during cinema screenings. The first look at Apple's new AI strategy is\nwidely anticipated to arrive alongside previews of its next-generation\noperating systems at WWDC in early June.\n\nTags: Artificial Intelligence, France\n\n[ 58 comments ]\n\n## Top Rated Comments\n\nWWPD\n\n4 hours ago at 08:34 am\n\nOh great, the French.\n\nHey Siri, what is today's weather?\n\n\"Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries.\"\n\nScore: 14 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nbodhisattva\n\n4 hours ago at 08:07 am\n\nWWDC is certainly going to be interesting this year!\n\nScore: 12 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nboswald\n\n4 hours ago at 08:39 am\n\nI'm sure the inevitable \"doom 'n' gloom\" pain train will plow right through\nthis article (like everything else), but I, for one, am glad they're branching\nout and buying up important startups to expand their AI efforts.

It bought\nSiri, it bought Logic Pro, it bought facial recognition for iPhoto, it bought\nFinal Cut Pro, it bought a number of companies in order to bring in-house\nexpertise for iPod and iPhone development. Apple even needed to buy back Steve\nJobs via NeXT. Don't get me wrong, Apple has done a ton of innovation, but\nstrategic acquisitions played a big part in making that innovation happen. I\ndon't see this being any different.\n\nScore: 6 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nRead All Comments\n\n## Popular Stories\n\n### PlayStation, GameCube, Wii, and SEGA Emulator for iPhone and Apple TV\nComing to App Store\n\nFriday April 19, 2024 8:29 am PDT by Joe Rossignol\n\nThe lead developer of the multi-emulator app Provenance has told iMore that\nhis team is working towards releasing the app on the App Store, but he did not\nprovide a timeframe.
