The sources Fortune spoke to said some\nhires use their weekdays to learn how to scuba dive, while managers told off\nthe candidates for asking too many questions.\n\nAnd it seems some companies are also retaining their bloated headcount with\npeople who don\u2019t actually help drive the company forward. In fact in some\ncases, their presence actually holds back innovation.\n\nThat\u2019s according to David Ulevitch, general partner at venture capital firm\nAndreessen Horowitz, who said a \u201cbunch of people\u201d in large corporations are\nworking \u201cBS jobs.\u201d\n\nGoogle is an \u201camazing example\u201d of such a company, he told Emily Sundberg\u2019s\n\u201cFeed Me\u201d Substack newsletter.\n\n\u201cAnyone who works in a 10,000+ person or larger white-collar job company knows\nthat a bunch of the people can probably be let go tomorrow and the company\nwouldn\u2019t really feel the difference, maybe it\u2019d even improve with less people\ninserting themselves into things,\u201d began the partner at the VC giant also\nknown as a16z, which has backed the likes of Airbnb, Facebook, Instagram, and\nRoblox.\n\nAnother issue with \u201cBS jobs\u201d is that it detracts from shareholder returns, he\nexplained: \u201cThose people aren\u2019t just being useless (and being coddled to think\nuseless jobs actually matter\u2014they don\u2019t), but they are also taking money away\nfrom the rest of the workforce\u2019s retirement programs.\n\n\u201cGoogle is an amazing example of this. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s crazy to believe\nthat half the white-collar staff at Google probably does no real work,\u201d he\ncontinued. \u201cThe company has spent billions and billions of dollars per year on\nprojects that go nowhere for over a decade, and all that money could have been\nreturned to shareholders who have retirement accounts. So real people actually\nlose out when BS jobs exist.\u201d\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\n\n## Goggle\u2019s projects\n\nGoogle may certainly beg to differ. In December the Alphabet-owned company\nintegrated its quickly released Bard chatbot into a new service named Gemini,\nan AI model trained to behave in humanlike ways. The rollout will unfold in\nphases, with less sophisticated versions of Gemini called Nano and Pro being\nimmediately incorporated into Google\u2019s AI-powered chatbot Bard and its Pixel 8\nPro smartphone.\n\nFurther launches of Gemini haven\u2019t come off without a hitch: Its AI image tool\nattracted controversy and ridicule after it created misleading images of the\nrace of historical figures.\n\nBut the team at Google have also had some wins. In January a DeepMind product\nwas able to solve difficult geometry proofs used to test high school students\nin the International Mathematical Olympiad, while utilization of Gemini within\nGoogle\u2019s all-important search engine is ongoing.\n\nAnd while Ulevitch, who leads Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s American Dynamism\npractice, is unimpressed with some of Google\u2019s projects\u2014or his perceived lack\nthereof, given the funding allocated\u2014Wall Street certainly doesn\u2019t seem to\nmind. Shares in Google parent Alphabet are up almost 22% for the year to date,\nand up 57% over the past 12 months at the time of writing.\n\nAndreessen Horowitz did not immediately respond to Fortune\u2019s request for\ncomment, though Ulevitch told Business Insider: \u201cMy only comment is that I\nthink it ranks as one of the least controversial things I\u2019ve ever said.\u201d\n\n## Return to making\n\nOne of the fallouts of Ulevitch\u2019s \u201cBS jobs\u201d concern is that America is\nincreasingly losing the skills needed to build products and parts for its own\nindustrial future.\n\nInstead, he adds, \u201cwe have outsourced much of their work overseas,\nincreasingly to countries we are getting less and less friendly with (China)\nbut also because we\u2019ve just made those jobs seem less desirable.\u201d\n\nBut where this reliance on economic rivals could go sour\u2014an issue that also\nhas JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon worried\u2014there are also opportunities for\nstartups to fill that gap, Ulevitch added.\n\nIt may be welcome news, then, that enrollment in vocational-focused community\ncolleges rose 16% last year to its highest level since the National Student\nClearinghouse began tracking this data in 2018, as students increasingly look\nto tools and the trades for a fulfilling career.\n\nIn fact the data revealed a 23% surge in students studying construction trades\nin 2023 compared to 2022, as well as a 7% increase in HVAC and vehicle\nmaintenance and repair programs.\n\nSubscribe to Data Sheet, our daily newsletter about the business of tech.
