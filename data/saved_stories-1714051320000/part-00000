Courtesy of Jeanne Pepper\n\nBy Louis Keene April 16, 2024\n\nSANTA ANA, CALIF. \u2013 Any notion that Judaism would take a backseat in Samuel\nWoodward\u2019s trial for the murder of Blaze Bernstein dissolved in five words,\ndelivered with barely concealed contempt at the end of the trial\u2019s third day.\n\n\u201cHis last name was Bernstein.\u201d\n\nThe words, from the victim\u2019s father, won\u2019t appear in the courtroom transcript.\nThe judge struck them from the record. He said they didn\u2019t answer to the\nquestion the defense attorney put to Gideon Bernstein \u2014 whether his son wore a\nyarmulke. But with Bernstein\u2019s remark, a second front in the courtroom\nshowdown opened: Was his son, whom the prosecution claims was stabbed to death\nbecause he was gay, also a victim of antisemitism?\n\n### Antisemitism Notebook\n\nYour weekly guide through the news and the noise of how rising antisemitism\nand disputes over how to address it are shaping American Jewish life.\n\nThe answer could have legal ramifications. Woodward, 26, has pleaded not\nguilty to charges of first-degree murder and committing a hate crime. A guilty\nverdict on the latter would mean a sentence of life without the possibility of\nparole. And the prosecution only needs to prove one category of hate was a\nfactor.\n\nBut according to Brian Levin, an expert on hate crime who founded the Center\nfor the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University San\nBernardino, it is not as easy as establishing \u2014 as is the case in this trial \u2014\nthat the victim was Jewish and his killer was active in a neo-Nazi group.\n\n\u201cBias doesn\u2019t have to be the sole motivating factor\u201d for a hate crime\nconviction, Levin said. \u201cBut it has to be one of them. And that has to be\nproven beyond reasonable doubt.\u201d\n\nSix years after Blaze Bernstein\u2019s death at 19, and five days into the trial,\nmuch of the case appears settled. Woodward\u2019s attorney conceded in his opening\nargument that his client \u2014 who had attended high school with Bernstein; the\ntwo matched on Tinder in June 2017 and again the night Blaze disappeared \u2014 had\ncommitted homicide. What is left to debate is the motive.\n\nPainted rocks decorate a memorial for Blaze Bernstein at Borrego Park in\nFoothill Ranch, California.

What do they like?\u201d\n\nSince then, however, Bernstein\u2019s Jewish identity has gradually come to the\nfore as Walker bookended each Bernstein parent\u2019s testimony with questions\nabout their Jewish identity. The first thing she asked Jeanne Pepper, Blaze\u2019s\nmother, was the family\u2019s religion and race (\u201cWe are a Jewish family,\u201d Pepper\nanswered). And among the final questions she asked Gideon Bernstein were about\nBlaze\u2019s involvement in Jewish community.\n\nBefore perhaps a dozen of their friends from Irvine\u2019s University Synagogue in\ncourt to support them, their testimony painted a picture of a boy raised in a\ndeeply Jewish household. The jury learned the family regularly attended\nsynagogue on Shabbat and celebrated Jewish holidays; when Blaze was in high\nschool, he served as a madrich, or counselor, for first graders in the\nsynagogue\u2019s religious school, which he had attended as a child.\n\nWith much of Walker\u2019s opening statement oriented around Woodward\u2019s alleged gay\nhatred, defense attorney Ken Morrison had attempted to refute the charge by\nfocusing on Woodward\u2019s internal conflict about his own sexuality and the\nrepressive environment in which he grew up. Morrison shared that his client\nhad sent nude images of himself in high school to a male classmate; meanwhile,\nWoodward\u2019s father believed homosexuality was a sin and his older brother\nteased him relentlessly.\n\n### Related\n\n  * Defense admits Blaze Bernstein\u2019s \u2018unlawful killing\u2019 but denies premeditation on first day of long-awaited trial\n\nIt seemed Morrison would let Bernstein\u2019s religiosity go unchallenged in the\nparents\u2019 cross-examination. But on April 11, in one of his last questions to\nBernstein\u2019s father, Morrison asked whether the family would attend Jewish\nevents at the temple. Gideon Bernstein said yes.\n\nWould Blaze wear a yarmulke to those events? Yes.\n\nAnd at any other events in which Judaism would play a role, would he wear a\nyarmulke? Again the answer was yes, but by now Bernstein sensed where Morrison\nwas headed.\n\n\u201cBut beyond those types of activities or events, Blaze didn\u2019t wear a yarmulke\non a daily basis, did he?\u201d Morrison asked.\n\n\u201cHis last name was Bernstein,\u201d Bernstein said. Judge Kim Menninger sustained\nMorrison\u2019s objection, and Bernstein tried again: \u201cHe didn\u2019t wear a yarmulke,\nbut I think all his friends knew he was Jewish.\u201d Again Morrison objected, and\nthe words after \u201cyarmulke\u201d were struck from the record.\n\nThat concluded the cross-examination.\n\nPainted rocks decorate a memorial for Blaze Bernstein at Borrego Park in Lake\nForest, California. Photo by Louis Keene\n\n## Intersectionality\n\nLevin, the hate crime law expert, said that Woodward potentially being gay did\nnot insulate him from charges of anti-gay hate. He pointed to internecine hate\ncrime convictions in the Amish community as an example, and a Nazi skinhead in\nFlorida who was Jewish.\n\nA defense attorney could try to use their client\u2019s inner turmoil to challenge\nthe notion of bias, he said. But if there\u2019s inner turmoil, there\u2019s probably a\ndegree of hatred fueling it.\n\n\u201cIf someone\u2019s supposedly conflicted, there\u2019s obviously some kind of bias with\nregard to how they feel about possibly being gay,\u201d Levin said.\n\nLevin has been following the Bernstein case and characterized the evidence \u2014\nWoodward\u2019s membership in Atomwaffen Division, his virulently anti-gay writings\nand the neo-Nazi skull mask found with Bernstein\u2019s DNA on it \u2014 as clear basis\nfor hate crime charges.\n\nGiven the abundance of evidence that Bernstein was killed because he was gay,\nI asked Levin why the prosecution would try to assert that Bernstein\u2019s\nJewishness also made him a target. He noted that victims are often the members\nof more than one marginalized group \u2014 for example, transgender women of color.\nAnd if the jury buys Morrison\u2019s defense on the anti-gay matter, the\nprosecution still has the victim\u2019s Jewish identity as something of a backup\nmotive.\n\nThough Blaze Bernstein did not wear a yarmulke to class at Orange County\nSchool of the Arts, and the court reporter excised Gideon Bernstein\u2019s pointed\nresponse, the jury might conclude that the assailant\u2019s loyalty to Atomwaffen\nand his victim\u2019s Jewish last name offer enough of a nexus.\n\n\u201cThese kinds of hatreds also have intersectionality,\u201d Levin said. \u201cSomeone can\nhave dual motives or even motives where one amplifies the other. In that\nsubculture, harming a gay person or harming a Jew is considered a badge of\nhonor.\u201d\n\n### Related\n\n  * \u2018I want to find Blaze as much as you do\u2019: Call from Blaze Bernstein\u2019s alleged murderer to distraught parents played at trial\n  * Blaze Bernstein\u2019s cryptic final texts revealed in court as Woodward murder trial continues\n\nLouis Keene is a staff reporter at the Forward covering religion, sports and\nthe West Coast.
