These chips function as the temporary storage for an operating\nsystem, and speed is of great importance, as they\u2019re constantly needing to\naccess bits of memory to keep everything running smoothly. For more than two\ndecades, the most advanced version of this technology\u2014magnetoresistive RAM, or\nMRAM\u2014has been the go-to tech for the kind of intense computing necessary in\nindustrial, military, and space applications.\n\nNow, a new breakthrough discovered by scientists at the Hebrew University of\nJerusalem, has illustrated how a mechanism in a laser beam can control the\nmagnetic state in solids, which the scientists describe as a \u201cparadigm shift\u201d\nin our understanding of the behavior between light and magnetic materials. The\nresults of the study were published earlier this year in the journal Physical\nReview Research.\n\n###### Related Story\n\n  * Scientists Found a Fancy New Way to Create Qubits\n\n\u201cThis discovery has far-reaching implications, particularly in the domain of\ndata recording using light and nano-magnets,\u201d Amir Capua, head of the\nuniversity\u2019s Spintronics lab and study co-author, said in a press statement.\n\u201cIt hints at the potential realization of ultra-fast and energy-efficient\noptically controlled MRAM and a seismic shift in information storage and\nprocessing across diverse sectors.\u201d\n\nRAM works by using incredibly tiny electromagnets that, once magnetized with\nvoltage, can encode as \u201con\u201d or \u201coff\u201d\u20141s and 0s in binary speak.\n\nThis breakthrough analyzes the often overlooked magnetic properties of light,\nwhich led the research team to discover that rapidly oscillating light waves\ncan control magnets\u2014a huge boon in the field of memory and data storage. With\ntheir new mathematical equation, Capua and his team were able to describe the\nstrength of this interaction, along with the \u201camplitude of the magnetic field\nof light, its frequency, and the energy absorption of the magnetic material,\u201d\naccording to the press release.\n\nOf course, the intersection of magnetism and light is old hat for the quantum\nrealm, but the idea is rarely applied in the realm of spintronics\u2014a\nportmanteau of \u201cspin\u201d and \u201celectronics\u201d that explores the relationship between\nan electron\u2019s spin and magnetism. This concept is what lies at the heart of\nMRAM, which uses an electron\u2019s spin to store information.\n\n###### Related Story\n\n  * A New Process Could Make Computers 2x Faster\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve arrived at a very elementary equation describing this interaction,\u201d\nCapua told Live Science. \u201cIt lets us completely reconsider optical magnetic\nrecording and navigate our way to a dense, energy-efficient, cost-efficient\noptical magnetic storage device that doesn't even exist yet.\u201d\n\nBut thinking of storage devices that don\u2019t exist yet as the era of quantum\ncomputers approaches will need to come with quantum-capable RAM as well. Live\nScience reports that such a technology could use a beam of light to fix a\nmagnetic bit in a superposition of both 1 and 0, similar to how qubits work in\nquantum computers.\n\nFor now, that future is still a ways off. Today, MRAM is only beginning its\nascendency in the computing world, but this new discovery gives it a big boost\nas the memory chip of the future.\n\nDarren Orf\n\nDarren lives in Portland, has a cat, and writes/edits about sci-fi and how our\nworld works.
