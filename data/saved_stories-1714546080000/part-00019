One of my favorite Dutch blogs was Mijn\nKop Thee. That blog was the blog of Bob den Otter.\n\nBob also developed Pivot (and later PivotX), blogging software that a big part\nof the Dutch blogging community (including myself for quite some time) used.\nAnd perhaps also internationally, I have no idea. What I did know is that even\nin Pivot, while it was fully file-based and no databases were harmed yet, the\nmost important thing was that it was so well-developed. Usable. Intuitive. I\nloved it.\n\nThe first time I can remember meeting Bob was at a meetup I helped organize\nout of the Dutch PHP usergroup. It was in The Hague, Bob's hometown, and it\nwas on frontend technologies. I have a habit of putting people that I look up\nto on pedestals and being \"afraid\" of meeting them, but Bob was so\napproachable, open and friendly. It felt like there was an immediate\nconnection.\n\nSince then we have been in contact on a regular basis. I worked for his\ncompany Two Kings on a project once and learned a lot from him. About software\ndevelopment, but also about running a business. Bob hated \"payment terms\". So\nwhen you sent him an invoice, he would just pay it immediately. It's something\nI started doing since then as well. Because it makes absolutely no sense to\nwait for 30 days to make a payment.\n\nAnother fond memory of Bob is the time when we sat down on Vlieland to work on\nthe website of Into The Great Wide Open. Two Kings builds the website of this\nfestival and I volunteered to help with the site. Sitting there with the Two\nKings crew working on building the new site was a fantastic experience. Bob\nbuilt an amazing team, and with that team also built amazing websites.\n\nI mentioned Pivot(X) before, but more recently Bob built and open sourced Bolt\nCMS. As before, I love it because it's so intuitive and easy to easy. Defining\nnew data types simply in a configuration file and the system will\nautomatically just use that, that's amazing. With it being based on Symfony,\nit's also quite easy to extend or alter it's behaviour. I'm really going to\nmiss Bob's vision on software development. He made things easier for everyone,\ndisliked unneeded complexity and just wanted to get the job done well.\n\nWhat I'm going to miss most though is Bob's passion. It didn't matter what\nsubject. Festivals, music, artisinal web development, climate change, you name\nit. Every year we would find each other on Vlieland for the Into The Great\nWide Open festival. We'd compare our planning (as you can see in the picture\nabove), talk to each other about great new bands, or share a beer in the\nspecial beer bar on the festival site.\n\nBob passed away on January 18, and I still can't believe it. I've re-read the\nmessage notifying me of his passing multiple times just to get that\nconfirmation that indeed, it is true. I don't want to believe it. Without\nexaggerating, Bob was one of my favourite people on this planet. My heart goes\nout to his partner and family, to the team at Two Kings, and to all who knew\nhim.\n\nBob, wherever you are, thank you for all you did. You inspired me, and I will\ncarry your lessons with me forever.\n\n#### About\n\nPosted on: 22-01-2024 Posted by: Stefan Koopmanschap Image by Marjolein van\nElteren\n\nCategories php bobdenotter boltcms pivot festivals music\n\n", "frontpage": false}
