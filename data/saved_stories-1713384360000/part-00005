It\nturns out this longtime open-source Nouveau driver developer is now employed\nby NVIDIA Corp and continuing to work on the open-source Linux graphics\ndriver.\n\nBen Skeggs is at NVIDIA. I'm not sure what is more surprising that he is at\nthe green giant or that he's able to continue working on the Nouveau driver in\nan official capacity. Ben Skeggs has been involved with the Nouveau project\nfor more than a decade.\n\nAfter months of being absent in Nouveau driver development happenings, last\nnight he posted a set of 156 patches. This massive patch series is a follow-up\nto the Nouveau GSP firmware enablement work and cleans up the code. The focus\non the series is replacing the ioctl-like interface between the NVKM and the\nNouveau DRM driver to now leverage more direct calls for reducing the driver\noverhead and call chain complexity. In the process there's also a fair amount\nof code cleaning. The 156 patches affect around ten thousand lines of code.\n\nAnd this big patch series is submitted from his new NVIDIA work email address:\n\nWhile NVIDIA has their open (out of tree) kernel drivers these days, it wasn't\non my bingo card to see Ben Skeggs at NVIDIA and to continue contributing\ndirectly to Nouveau. Interesting times ahead...\n\n18 Comments\n\nRelated News\n\nNouveau/NVK Driver Lands NIL Library Rewrite In Rust For Mesa 24.1\n\nNouveau GSP Fix On The Way For Regression That Broke Ampere GPU Support\n\nRed Hat's Long, Rust'ed Road Ahead For Nova As Nouveau Driver Successor\n\nNVK Lands Sparse Memory Support - Enabling More Games To Run On This Open-\nSource Driver\n\nNouveau Supporting HDMI 2.1 Won't Hopefully Be Too Challenging Thanks To\nNVIDIA Firmware\n\nMesa NVK Vulkan Driver Now Declared Vulkan 1.3 Conformant, Mesa 24.1 To Build\nBy Default\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
