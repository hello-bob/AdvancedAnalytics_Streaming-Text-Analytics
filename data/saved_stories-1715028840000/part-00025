But scientists are only beginning to\nunderstand why.\n\nCredit...Casey Zhang for The New York Times\n\nSupported by\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nBy Alice Callahan\n\n  * May 6, 2024\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Carlos Monteiro, a nutritional epidemiologist in Brazil,\nnoticed something alarming: Obesity rates among children in his country were\nrising rapidly.\n\nTo understand why, he and his colleagues at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo\nscrutinized data on the food buying patterns of Brazilian households to see if\nthey had changed in recent years. The researchers found that people were\npurchasing less sugar, salt, cooking oils and staples like rice and beans, and\nmore processed foods like sodas, sausages, instant noodles, packaged breads\nand cookies.\n\nTo describe that second category of food, the team came up with a new term:\nultraprocessed foods, or UPFs, which they would later link to weight gain in\nchildren and adults in Brazil.\n\nSince then, scientists have found associations between UPFs and a range of\nhealth conditions, including heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, obesity,\ngastrointestinal diseases and depression, as well as earlier death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThat\u2019s concerning, experts say, since ultraprocessed foods have become a major\npart of people\u2019s diets worldwide. They account for 67 percent of the calories\nconsumed by children and teenagers in the United States, for example.\n\nBut many questions remain. What are ultraprocessed foods, exactly? And how\nstrong is the evidence that they\u2019re harmful? We asked experts to answer these\nand other questions.\n\n## What are ultraprocessed foods?\n\nIn order to study foods based on how they were processed, Dr. Monteiro and his\ncolleagues developed a food classification system called Nova, named after the\nPortuguese and Latin words for \u201cnew.\u201d It has since been adopted by researchers\nacross the world.\n\nThe Nova system sorts foods into four categories:\n\n  * Unprocessed or minimally processed foods, like fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables, beans, lentils, meat, poultry, fish, eggs, milk, plain yogurt, rice, pasta, corn meal, flour, coffee, tea and herbs and spices.\n\n  * Processed culinary ingredients, such as cooking oils, butter, sugar, honey, vinegar and salt.\n\n  * Processed foods made by combining foods from Category 1 with the ingredients of Category 2 and preserving or modifying them with relatively simple methods like canning, bottling, fermentation and baking. This group includes freshly baked bread, most cheeses and canned vegetables, beans and fish. These foods may contain preservatives that extend shelf life.\n\n  * Ultraprocessed foods made using industrial methods and ingredients you wouldn\u2019t typically find in grocery stores \u2014 like high-fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils and concentrated proteins like soy isolate. They often contain additives like flavorings, colorings or emulsifiers to make them appear more attractive and palatable. Think sodas and energy drinks, chips, candies, flavored yogurts, margarine, chicken nuggets, hot dogs, sausages, lunch meats, boxed macaroni and cheese, infant formulas and most packaged breads, plant milks, meat substitutes and breakfast cereals.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the ingredient list and you see things that you wouldn\u2019t use\nin home cooking, then that\u2019s probably an ultraprocessed food,\u201d said Brenda\nDavy, a nutrition professor at Virginia Tech.\n\nImage\n\nCredit...Casey Zhang for The New York Times\n\nThe Nova system notably doesn\u2019t classify foods based on nutrients like fat,\nfiber, vitamins or minerals. It\u2019s \u201cagnostic to nutrition,\u201d said Maya\nVadiveloo, an associate professor of nutrition at the University of Rhode\nIsland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThat has led to debate among nutrition experts about whether it\u2019s useful for\ndescribing the healthfulness of a food, partly since many UPFs \u2014 like whole\ngrain breads, flavored yogurts and infant formulas \u2014 can provide valuable\nnutrients, Dr. Vadiveloo said.\n\n## Are ultraprocessed foods harmful?\n\nMost research linking UPFs to poor health is based on observational studies,\nin which researchers ask people about their diets and then track their health\nover many years. In a large review of studies that was published in 2024,\nscientists reported that consuming UPFs was associated with 32 health\nproblems, with the most convincing evidence for heart disease-related deaths,\nType 2 diabetes and common mental health issues like anxiety and depression.\n\nSuch studies are valuable, because they can look at large groups of people \u2014\nthe 2024 review included results from nearly 10 million \u2014 over the many years\nit can take for chronic health conditions to develop, said Josiemer Mattei, an\nassociate professor of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public\nHealth. She added that the consistency of the link between UPFs and health\nissues increased her confidence that there was a real problem with the foods.\n\nBut the observational studies also have limitations, said Lauren O\u2019Connor, a\nnutrition scientist and epidemiologist who formerly worked at the Department\nof Agriculture and the National Institutes of Health. It\u2019s true that there is\na correlation between these foods and chronic diseases, she said, but that\ndoesn\u2019t mean that UPFs directly cause poor health.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nDr. O\u2019Connor questioned whether it\u2019s helpful to group such \u201cstarkly different\u201d\nfoods \u2014 like Twinkies and breakfast cereals \u2014 into one category. Certain types\nof ultraprocessed foods, like sodas and processed meats, are more clearly\nharmful than others. UPFs like flavored yogurts and whole grain breads, on the\nother hand, have been associated with a reduced risk of developing Type 2\ndiabetes.\n\nClinical trials are needed to test if UPFs directly cause health problems, Dr.\nO\u2019Connor said. Only one such study, which was small and had some limitations,\nhas been done, she said.\n\nIn that study, published in 2019, 20 adults with a range of body sizes lived\nin a research hospital at the National Institutes of Health for four weeks.\nFor two weeks, they ate mainly unprocessed or minimally processed foods, and\nfor another two weeks, they ate mainly UPFs. The diets had similar amounts of\ncalories and nutrients, and the participants could eat as much as they wanted\nat each meal.\n\nDuring their two weeks on the ultraprocessed diet, participants gained an\naverage of two pounds and consumed about 500 calories more per day than they\ndid on the unprocessed diet. During their time on the unprocessed diet, they\nlost about two pounds.\n\nThat finding might help explain the link between UPFs, obesity and other\nmetabolic conditions, said Kevin Hall, a nutrition and metabolism researcher\nat the National Institutes of Health, who led the trial. But the study needs\nto be replicated, which Dr. Hall is in the process of doing now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\n## Why might UPFs be harmful?\n\nThere are many \u201cstrong opinions\u201d about why ultraprocessed foods are unhealthy,\nDr. Hall said. \u201cBut there\u2019s actually not a lot of rigorous science\u201d on what\nthose mechanisms are, he added.\n\nBecause UPFs are often cheap, convenient and accessible, they\u2019re probably\ndisplacing healthier foods from our diets, Dr. Hall said.\n\nImage\n\nCredit...Casey Zhang for The New York Times\n\nBut he and other scientists think that the foods could be having more direct\neffects on health. They can be easy to overeat \u2014 maybe because they contain\nhard-to-resist combinations of carbohydrates, sugars, fats and salt, are high-\ncalorie and easy to chew. It\u2019s also possible that resulting blood sugar spikes\nmay damage arteries or ramp up inflammation, or that certain food additives or\nchemicals may interfere with hormones, cause a \u201cleaky\u201d intestine or disrupt\nthe gut microbiome.\n\nResearchers, including Dr. Hall and Dr. Davy, are beginning to conduct small\nclinical trials that will test some of these theories. Such studies may help\nidentify the most harmful UPFs and even suggest how they may be made\nhealthier, Dr. Hall said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut most researchers think there are various ways the foods are causing harm.\n\u201cRarely in nutrition is there a single factor that fully explains the\nrelationship between foods and some health outcome,\u201d Dr. Vadiveloo said.\n\n## What should we do about ultraprocessed foods?\n\nIn 2014, Dr. Monteiro helped write new dietary guidelines for Brazil that\nadvised people to avoid ultraprocessed foods.\n\nOther countries like Mexico, Israel and Canada have also explicitly\nrecommended avoiding or limiting UPFs or \u201chighly processed foods.\u201d The U.S.\ndietary guidelines contain no such advice, but an advisory committee is\ncurrently looking into the evidence on how UPFs may affect weight gain, which\ncould influence the 2025 guidelines.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to know what to do about UPFs in the United States, where so\nmuch food is already ultraprocessed and people with lower incomes can be\nespecially dependent on them, Dr. Hall said.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, they are an important source of food, and food is\nfood,\u201d Dr. Mattei added. \u201cWe really cannot vilify them,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile research continues, expert opinions differ on how people should approach\nUPFs. Dr. Monteiro said that the safest course is to avoid them altogether \u2014\nto swap flavored yogurt for plain yogurt with fruit, for example, or to buy a\nfresh loaf from a local bakery instead of packaged bread, if you can afford to\ndo so.\n\nDr. Vadiveloo suggested a more moderate strategy, focusing on limiting UPFs\nthat don\u2019t provide valuable nutrients, like soda and cookies. She also\nrecommended eating more fruits, vegetables, whole grains (ultraprocessed or\nnot), legumes, nuts and seeds.\n\nCook at home as much as you can, using minimally processed foods, Dr. Davy\nsaid. \u201cWe can\u2019t really say a whole lot beyond that at this point.\u201d\n\nAlice Callahan is a Times reporter covering nutrition and health.
