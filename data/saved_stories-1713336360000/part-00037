He makes the point at the end of his blog post, \"There is in\nfact relatively little significance to learning to complete on time.\" I agree\nwith this statement and I\u2019m going to expand upon it.\n\nWho set the deadline for the assignment? Why was that particular deadline set?\nIn most cases I am sure the answer to the first question is the teacher, and\nthe answer to the second question was that because that particular deadline\nwas convenient for the teacher. Some schools have got better answers to the\n2nd question in the form of homework and assignment calendars, and if your\nschool isn\u2019t already doing some sort of load-balancing of assignments on\nstudents, I recommend it as a good starting place.\n\nWhen the teacher assigns the deadline for the students, they are sending a\nmessage. \"I am your boss, you will do as I say,\" which reinforces the teacher\nstudent hierarchy. If the teacher explains the reasons for a particular\ndeadline, the hierarchy still exists, but now the teacher has become the\n\"supportive\" boss. If a teacher is willing to extend a deadline for a student,\nthey are now the \"empathetic\" boss. However, they are still the boss. Do we\nwant to tell students that what is important in your classroom is who is in\ncharge?\n\nDeadlines teachers assign are largely arbirtrary. In some cases they are meant\nto be logically placed around holidays, end of semesters, or between other\nteacher\u2019s assignments, but these are arbitrary placements. If a deadline is\narbitrary, why are we so stuck as teachers on making sure students meet it?\nWhat outcome are we hoping for from students when we are in charge of the\ndeadlines?\n\nIf you listen to some educators, they\u2019ll tell you that meeting deadlines\nteaches responsibility, and that meeting deadlines gives you a sense of\npurpose. So we might assign deadlines for these two reasons, if either of them\nwas true. As far as I know, there is no research to support either of these\nclaims.\n\nTell me the last time you met a deadline for a major project, say a curriculum\nreview. Did you feel like had a sense of purpose? Did you feel like it taught\nyou responsibility? It\u2019s not the meeting of the deadline that gave you your\nsense of accomplishment, it was the completing of the project. Completing\nthings makes us feel good. We feel proud of ourselves when we produce\nsomething awesome. It doesn\u2019t matter in most cases if it took us 2 days or 20\nweeks (unless you are trying for a speed record), we feel good because we\nfinished.\n\nFurthermore, who can really say that a project is really done? Even a\npublished book has errors, and ends up being republished with revisions.\nNothing is really ever done, we just decide we are done working on it when we\nfeel like it is a \"finished\" project. I\u2019ll probably come back and read this\nblog post in a year and find things I want to change.\n\nSo here\u2019s my challenge to you. If you really feel you must have deadlines for\nassignments, find reasons why the deadline matters. Make the deadline less\narbitrary. For example, \"we need to finish these projects by Friday because\nthe Mayor of the city is going to come and see them then\" or \"We have to have\nthe letters done soon because our friends in Kenya are expecting them.\"\n\nAlternatively, take the time to discuss the deadlines with the students. Ask\nthem what they think and what would work for them. Remember, to you the\ndeadline is mostly arbitrary, letting the students decide on the deadline\nwon\u2019t make it any less arbitrary, but it will give them some choice.\n\nOur schools are currently intended to produce worker bees, and drones, but not\nthinkers. Our insistence on enforcing arbitrary deadlines just reinforces the\npower relationship between students and teachers and prevents students from\nbeing able to make their own deadlines and become more self-directed in their\nlearning.\n\n  * Comments\n\n  * Post info\n\n  * Author info\n\n## 6 Comments\n\n#### Add yours \u2192\n\n  1. #### Alyssa Becker says:\n\nI completely agree! In my classes, we discuss deadlines for projects and\nassignments and set due dates \u2013 these are mostly recommended guidelines or\nsuggestions. Usually it is to finish up a project at the same time we\u2019re\nending a unit and moving on to a new topic \u2013 but for students who require more\ntime, they are allowed. I find my students are usually shocked about this \u2013\nthey are constantly asking me for extensions and look at me in disbelief when\nI tell them to take all the time they need.\n\nIt seems to me that deadlines are more often set for the convenience of the\nteacher \u2013 that way we can mark everything at once, or don\u2019t have to seek out\nunfinished assignments. And while it is true (marking all assignments at once\nis easier), i don\u2019t think my convenience comes close to trumping student\nlearning. However, in my school, the vast majority still feel differently. In\none class, students are forced to wear a large dunce cap if they come to class\nwithout completed homework. I can only hope that other teachers will begin to\nsee that those choices do more harm than good.\n\nJanuary 16, 2011 \u2014 2:57 pm\n\nReply\n\n     * #### David Wees says:\n\nAre you serious about the dunce cap? That\u2019s crazy! I thought the days of\npublicly shaming students were over. How can the principal of the school\nsupport that kind of policy?\n\nJanuary 16, 2011 \u2014 3:01 pm\n\n  2. #### @zgporter says:\n\nI do not have a final deadline for assignments in my class. There is, however,\na time that it is due. At least in Middle School, part of our job is teaching\nlife skills. Te management is huge in pre-teens because there is little to\nspeak of. A due in my class is more of a remInder that there will be no more\nclass time devoted to a lesson or project.\n\nJanuary 17, 2011 \u2014 8:55 am\n\nReply\n\n  3. #### Education4Real says:\n\nIt really comes down to what you believe a \u201cgrade\u201d is \u2013 does a grade tell a\nstudent and his/her parents how well he/she plays the game of school, or how\nwell he/she has mastered the information? If it is the former, then the grade\nshouldn\u2019t count anyway... if it is the latter, then why take points off/not\naccept a late assignment? I would hope teachers would assess the learning that\nis going on, not the \u201clearning to color within the lines.\u201d The world needs\nmore rebellious thinkers!\n\nhttp://www.Education4Real.com\n\nJanuary 17, 2011 \u2014 12:07 pm\n\nReply\n\n  4. #### Anonymous says:\n\nWhen I was at college \u201cdeadlines\u201d were very vague and most tutors were okay\nabout missing a deadline as long as a student could show the work was being\ndone. In fact, quite often, work would be set and a vague deadline would be\ngiven and then the work was not called in at all.\n\nHowever, in the \u201creal\u201d world. Deadlines are a vital pulse to the work cycle \u2013\nno matter how arbitrary they actually are. Today I had to hand in some work to\nmy boss and, although she was adamant it was needed today, I find that she\u2019s\nnot actually back from holiday until tomorrow and the other boss who also\nneeds to see the work won\u2019t be back from holiday for another week. I\u2019ve also\nbeen plagued over the past three months by a job that has had a great torrent\nof arbitrary deadlines and, although I\u2019m told that each deadline is the\npublishing date, it turns out that it\u2019s still only a draft for approval and\nbounces back to me with a whole swathe of new, counter or reverse amendments.\nAt the back of my mind I don\u2019t think it will ever be published. Great fun!\n\nHowever, most of the dates I\u2019m given for final publication are genuine and are\nworth working towards.\n\nStudents who intend to leave the education system for a job will have to get\nused to the pedantic enforcement of arbitrary deadlines in order to be able to\ndiscern the difference between that kind of \u201cdeadline\u201d and the kind that is\nreally significant \u2013 like in matters of life and death. On balance, no matter\nhow tedious and irritating, I think I prefer the arbitrary kind at least they\ndon\u2019t end in death.\n\nAugust 22, 2011 \u2014 3:50 am\n\nReply\n\n  5. #### carol Mazur says:\n\nHow about the responsibility the teacher has to grade reports, projects and\npapers within a timely manner and part of that reponsibility comes from\nstudents meeting deadlines? I\u2019m all for discussion and sometimes deadlines are\nhard and fast for the reason that students will drag out even the smallest\nproject, lose interest, lose their work, make excuses, etc... Arbitrary never\nworked for me when I was an office manager in commercial real estate, I find\nit hard to believe since many educators believe in feelings first they should\ntrump the reality of a deadline.\n\nApril 8, 2016 \u2014 5:35 pm\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
