In death, the 39-year-old has become a tragic symbol of how\noverstretched and overburdened the NHS has become.\n\nRublite died after being found unconscious under her coat in an A&E waiting\nroom more than eight hours after arriving.\n\nLearning what happened to Rublite in the hours before her death has been gut-\nwrenching for her friends and family.\n\nShe sat through the night at Queen\u2019s Medical Centre (QMC) in Nottingham after\narriving at 10.30pm on 19 January with severe headache, dizziness, high blood\npressure and vomiting.\n\nWhen her name was called seven hours later, at about 5.30am, she did not\nrespond and staff discharged her believing she had tired of waiting and gone\nhome.\n\nBut over an hour later she was discovered having a seizure after falling\nasleep, and then unconscious, under her coat.\n\nShe was rushed to intensive care but had suffered a brain haemorrhage, and the\nbleeding was so severe it was inoperable. She was declared dead two days later\non 22 January, when her life support was switched off.\n\n\u201cThat is the official date of death, but I think she basically died in that\nwaiting room,\u201d said Rublite\u2019s twin sister, Inese Briede. \u201cNo one was doing\nanything for her. And by the time they found her, it was too late.\u201d\n\nInga Rublite suffered a brain haemorrhage after a long wait in A&E.\nPhotograph: Family handout\n\nShe was very close to her identical twin, despite the fact Briede lives in\ntheir home country of Latvia. \u201cWe would talk on the phone every day, three\ntimes, sometimes more,\u201d she said.\n\nThe pair had moved to the UK together in 2004 after finishing school. When\nBriede moved back home in 2008, her twin sister stayed on, gaining GCSEs,\nsteady work in Nottingham and becoming the mother of two sons, now aged 13 and\n11.\n\nThe boys are now being cared for by their father.\n\n\u201cShe lived there for 20 years, she paid all the taxes, she worked hard and\npaid everything on time. She did everything right. Even that day when the\nheadache came on, she stayed in work,\u201d Briede said.\n\n\u201cIn all those years, the one time she went to the hospital to ask for help, no\none was looking at her. I can\u2019t describe how that feels. That you can\u2019t get\nhelp in the place where you\u2019re supposed to go for help.\u201d\n\nRublite was chatting to her sister on FaceTime during her lunch break on 19\nJanuary when she suddenly started complaining of a headache. She took\npainkillers and finished her shift at a warehouse distributing uniforms,\nbefore going home and sleeping for five hours.\n\nShe was awoken by her sister\u2019s call in the evening. Her headache was worse,\nshe couldn\u2019t sit still and she couldn\u2019t eat.\n\n\u201cShe measured her blood pressure and it was 156. I remember that. That big\nnumber. I told her you have to call the hospital, you have to go to hospital,\u201d\nBriede said.\n\nRublite called for an ambulance but was told none were available, and as she\nwas too ill to drive, she asked her work colleague and nextdoor neighbour,\nRasa Balzonyt, to take her.\n\nBalzonyt described her friend as \u201cvery fit and healthy\u201d, active and always\nsmiling. At the warehouse where the pair worked, Rublite \u201cdid the job of two\npeople, she worked so fast\u201d.\n\n\u201cShe was full of energy, she couldn\u2019t sit still at home, she was always\nplanning trips for us and the kids,\u201d Balzonyt said.\n\nOn that evening, she said Rublite felt dizzy and threw up during the drive to\nhospital, and when they arrived at about 10.30pm she was checked over by a\nnurse who took her temperature and blood pressure.\n\nShe waited with her friend at A&E for two hours, until after midnight, but\nwhen nursing staff told them it would be a nine-hour wait to see a doctor,\nBalzonyt returned home to look after her son.\n\n\u201cNo one saw her when I was there, her name was never called. I was getting so\nfrustrated and angry,\u201d she said. \u201cI told her I would keep my phone on loud and\nshe could call me whenever she was done, whatever the time, and I\u2019d pick her\nup.\n\n\u201cI left her in a safe space, I thought she would be fine. I thought the\ndoctors would help her. It should have been the safest place. We didn\u2019t\nrealise how serious it was.\u201d\n\nInga Rublite: \u2018she was so full of energy\u2019. Photograph: Family photo\n\nIn Latvia, Briede repeatedly called her sister in the morning, and at around\n7am the FaceTime call was picked up by a nurse who told her someone needed to\ncome to the hospital immediately. She could see her sister\u2019s legs on a\nhospital bed in the background.\n\n\u201cThey said they had just found Inga having a seizure. I was in shock \u2013 \u2018where\ndid you find her? Where?\u2019 No one answered me,\u201d she said.\n\nBriede said that she was told by doctors on two occasions that if her sister\nhad been treated more quickly, she might have survived.\n\n\u201cI was told that this whole situation could have been avoided if someone had\nseen her, or if someone was just checking up on her. It\u2019s so hard to know that\nthere could really still be a person here if someone was doing their job,\u201d she\nsaid.\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe that they had taken her off the waiting list when she\ndidn\u2019t answer. Did anyone look for her? Did anyone check the CCTV cameras to\nsee if she had left?\u201d\n\nBriede said she had asked for the CCTV footage showing her sister\u2019s last\nmoments in the waiting room but her request was denied.\n\n\u201cWhen they gave me back Inga\u2019s stuff, there was vomit on her phone, on her\nwallet. Her clothes were soaked in urine,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe she was\nalready unconscious when they found her, but at what time exactly did she\nbecome unconscious?\u201d\n\nAs more and more people face long wait times in A&E, research points towards a\ncorresponding increase in deaths. Calculations by the Royal College of\nEmergency Medicine (RCEM) found that almost 14,000 people died needlessly last\nyear in England while waiting in A&E for up to 12 hours.\n\nBriede said she had sympathy for the staff at QMC after visiting the hospital\nwhen she came to the UK the following day. She saw the overcrowded waiting\nroom, beds in the corridor, irate patients shouting at staff for having to\nwait so long.\n\n\u201cI know that it\u2019s hard for us, and it\u2019s hard for them as well. When I came in,\nI told them how angry I was, that no one was looking after Inga and you didn\u2019t\ndo your job right. And they\u2019re just quietly taking all this. I feel guilty for\nthat,\u201d she said.\n\nHer sister\u2019s death will be examined by a coroner at an inquest in July, and\nthe family hope that will provide some answers about exactly what happened,\nand whether her death could have been prevented.\n\n\u201cThis is not something you can just accept,\u201d said Briede. \u201cHow long is the\nhospital going to work like this? Because it has been like this for years.\nPeople are dying and everyone is just being quiet about it.\u201d\n\nDr Keith Girling, medical director at Nottingham university hospitals NHS\ntrust, which includes the QMC, said: \u201cI offer my sincere condolences to the\nfamily at this difficult time. An investigation is now taking place and, until\nthis has been concluded, we are unable to comment further.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * NHS\n  * Nottingham\n  * Health\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Number waiting over 18 weeks for NHS heart treatment in England rises fivefold\n\n11 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Tenfold rise in A&E patients waiting more than 24 hours for a bed\n\n7 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Almost 10 million people in England could be on NHS waiting list\n\n3 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### NHS faces \u2018avalanche\u2019 of demand for autism and ADHD services, thinktank warns\n\n4 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### \u2018Huge human and economic toll\u2019: one in seven people in England waiting for NHS treatment\n\n8 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Sunak admits failure over promise to cut NHS waiting lists\n\n5 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Record 420,000 patients in England had \u2018more than 12 hour wait\u2019 in A&E last year\n\n14 Jan 2024\n\n  * ### NHS must treat 10% more non-urgent cases a month to reduce backlog \u2013 study\n\n11 Jan 2024\n\n  * ### \u2018Ramp up\u2019 weekend hospital appointments to clear backlog, Labour tells PM\n\n17 Dec 2023\n\n  * ### \u2018Misleading\u2019 A&E figures in England hiding poor performance\n\n28 Oct 2023\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * UK\n  * UK politics\n  * Education\n  * Media\n  * Society\n  * Law\n  * Scotland\n  * Wales\n  * Northern Ireland\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
