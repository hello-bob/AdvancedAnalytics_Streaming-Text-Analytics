On May 1st, 2024, we'll update our website to\nreflect these changes. This page details the changes and addresses common\nquestions. If you have any queries, please contact sales@octopus.com.\n\n## What's changing?\n\n### Pricing model\n\nWe're moving from per-target to per-project pricing, with tenants and machines\nas add-ons.\n\n  * Projects are a resource in Octopus Deploy that stores the deployment configuration for an application.\n  * Tenants are a resource in Octopus Deploy that represents a customer, a physical location, a customer\u2019s physical location, or something else that runs a unique copy of the application with a slightly different configuration.\n  * Machines are Windows, Linux, or MacOS application hosts registered with Octopus Deploy.\n\nWe'll no longer charge for Kubernetes clusters, Azure Web Apps, Azure Service\nFabric clusters, or ECS clusters.\n\n### Octopus Cloud\n\nWe're eliminating month-to-month cloud. All existing Octopus Cloud customers\nwill transition to annual deals later this year. We're estimating for that\ntransition to start in October 2024.\n\nOctopus Cloud customers will get charged a flat platform fee based on the\ninstance\u2019s task cap. This replaces the $3 per month customers previously paid\non our per-target pricing model.\n\nThe Community license tier is being replaced with the Starter license tier,\nwhich has changes to entitlements. See below for more details.\n\n## New pricing model\n\n### Price  \n  \n---  \nStarterSee below for more details.| $360 / year (USD)  \nProfessional| $96 / project / year (USD)  \nEnterprise| $144 / project / year (USD)  \n  \n### Add-on price  \n  \n---  \nTenantsA resource within Octopus Deploy that represents a customer, a physical\nlocation, a customer\u2019s physical location, or something else that runs a unique\ncopy of the application with a slightly different configuration.| $72 / tenant\n/ year (USD)  \nMachinesWindows, Linux, or MacOS application hosts registered with Octopus\nDeploy.| $72 / machine / year (USD)  \n  \nPlease note: If you're an Octopus Cloud customer, you'll be charged platform\nfees as per below.\n\nVolume pricing is available. We support a variety of use cases and want to\nwork with all our existing customers. Please contact sales@octopus.com to\ndiscuss options.\n\n## Octopus Cloud platform fees\n\n### Fee\n\n|\n\n### Professional\n\n|\n\n### Enterprise  \n  \n---|---|---  \nTask cap = 5| $2,250 / year (USD)  \nTask cap = 10| $4,500 / year (USD)  \nTask cap = 20| $9,000 / year (USD)  \nTask cap = 40| $18,000 / year (USD)  \nTask cap = 80| $36,000 / year (USD)  \nTask cap = 160| $72,000 / year (USD)  \n  \nThe default task caps for our license tiers are:\n\n  * Professional: 5\n  * Enterprise: 20\n\nFile storage: 1TB (The amount of packages, artifacts, and task logs you can\nstore for deployments).\n\nDatabase storage: 100GB (The amount of configuration data you can store for\ndeployments).\n\n## Starter tier\n\nThe Community license tier is being replaced with the Starter license tier.\nThe changes between the starter tier and the community tier are as follows:\n\n### Community\n\n|\n\n### Starter  \n  \n---|---  \nPrice| $120 / year USD for Cloud. Free for self-hosted.| $360 / year USD (for\nCloud and self-hosted)  \nProject limit| 5| 10  \nTenant limit| No practical limit| 10  \nMachine limit| 5 (targets)| 10  \nUser limit| 5| No practical limit  \nRBAC controls  \nSSO  \n  \n## Frequently asked questions\n\n### General\n\n#### Why are you changing your pricing model?\n\nWe have been pricing per target for many years now, but it doesn\u2019t work in a\ncloud-native world. Virtual machines, Kubernetes clusters, and PaaS\napplication hosts do not equal one another. One Windows or Linux server could\nhost dozens of applications, while a Kubernetes cluster can host hundreds or\nthousands. Conversely, one PaaS application can host a single application. Yet\nour per-target pricing model was attempting to equate disparate application\nhosts.\n\nWe tried one last attempt to make it work with the recent changes a while ago\nand tried alternatives, like charging 1\u20445 of a target for each PaaS\napplication or charging per Kubernetes node. Ultimately, the alternatives\ndidn\u2019t work, leaving everyone more confused. We determined the best approach\nwas to move on from the per-target pricing model.\n\nWe want Octopus Deploy\u2019s pricing to be a fair exchange of value. At the same\ntime we don\u2019t want airline pricing where every customer pays a different\namount, nor something where you need a PhD to understand the price. Octopus\nDeploy's primary value is automating your applications' (projects')\ndeployments. An Octopus Deploy project provides additional value. You define\nand reuse a single process for multiple environments. Variable management\nmakes it easy to change environmental variables. That single process gets\nsnapshotted when you create a release, guaranteeing no surprises when\ndeploying to production because the process has already been tested multiple\ntimes.\n\nTenants and machines offer additional value. Tenanted deployments let a single\ndeployment process scale to hundreds or thousands of your customers or\nphysical locations. Deploying to Windows and Linux servers requires custom\nsoftware to handle secure communication, transfer the build artifacts, and run\ninstallation steps. However, not everyone needs tenants and machines, so we\nmade them add-ons.\n\n#### Why are you removing month-to-month Cloud subscriptions?\n\nMonth-to-month makes sense for our Cloud customers with our per-target pricing\nmodel. The number of targets can increase and decrease from month to month.\nMonthly subscriptions make less sense when charging for the number of\napplications deployed (projects), with tenants and machines as add-ons.\n\nIf you're a month-to-month customer, please review the starter tier below, as\nwe've increased limits and added back in specific functionality. To discuss\nthis further, please email sales@octopus.com.\n\n### License transition\n\n#### When do I have to transition to this new pricing model?\n\nAll new licenses and renewals will use the new pricing model.\n\nPlease contact sales@octopus.com to get a quote and discuss your options.\n\n#### What if I am facing a significant increase in license fees?\n\nPlease reach out to sales@octopus.com to discuss more. We support a variety of\nvolume pricing scenarios and want to work with you on options.\n\n#### What if I have a quote for per-target pricing?\n\nYour quote is valid. We honor all quotes for 30 days from the date it was\ncreated.\n\n#### What if I'm already in contact with sales about my renewal?\n\nDiscuss options with your sales representative.\n\n#### What will happen to my existing license?\n\nAll existing per-target licenses will continue to work until their term date.\nIf you have a Professional or Enterprise license purchased after September\n2022, you can continue to add targets until your term date. This is regardless\nof whether the license expires in 6 months or 3 years.\n\nIf you have a legacy license, which includes Standard, Data Center, Server,\nTeam, High Availability, Pre-2022 Professional, and Pre-2022 Enterprise,\nyou'll need to migrate to this new pricing model when you renew or change your\nlicense.\n\n#### How do I know how many projects, tenants, and machines my Octopus Deploy\ninstance has?\n\nPlease contact sales@octopus.com for steps on how to get an accurate count.\n\n#### Will you count deactivated projects and machines?\n\nWe have no plans to count deactivated projects and machines at this time.\nHowever, if we notice egregious abuses of that functionality, we reserve the\nright to address it on a case-by-case basis.\n\nPlease note: While projects and machines can be deactivated, tenants have no\nsuch functionality.\n\n#### Do you offer volume pricing?\n\nYes! We have volume pricing options to help support a variety of use cases.\nPlease email sales@octopus.com to discuss volume pricing.\n\n### Pricing model changes\n\n#### What is a project?\n\nA project is an Octopus resource you configure that primarily represents the\ndeployment configuration for an application. An application is a piece of\nsoftware that is independently deployable.\n\nSome examples of an application include:\n\n  * A monolithic application with dozens of components.\n  * A back-end REST API with a database as the data store.\n  * A serverless function that monitors a queue.\n  * A back-end service that runs in a container on a Kubernetes or ECS cluster.\n  * A scheduling service that uses CRON jobs to schedule tasks for other applications.\n\nA project is primarily a deployment configuration for an application. However,\nthere are other use cases for projects.\n\nSome examples of projects that are not deployment configurations for an\napplication include:\n\n  * Runbook-only projects that store a shared set of runbooks for common day-2 maintenance tasks.\n  * Orchestrator/traffic cop projects used to orchestrate the deployments of other Octopus Deploy projects.\n\nOctopus Deploy will count all active projects, regardless of whether they\ndeploy an application, are used for runbook only, or are used to orchestrate\nthe deployments of other Octopus Deploy projects.\n\n#### What is a tenant?\n\nA tenant is a resource you configure in Octopus Deploy that is meant to\nrepresent the following:\n\n  * One of your SaaS customers.\n  * A physical location includes a retail store, branch office, hospital, restaurant, factory, city, state, country, data center, or car wash.\n  * One of your customers' physical locations (for example. you deploy software to your customers' restaurants).\n\nEach tenant runs a dedicated copy of your application(s) with slightly\ndifferent configurations. Octopus Deploy will count all tenants, regardless of\nwhat they represent (customer, physical location, etc.) and the environments\nthey deploy to.\n\n#### What is a machine?\n\nA machine is a Windows, Linux, or MacOS application host \u2013 or deployment\ntarget \u2013 registered with Octopus Deploy.\n\n### Machine count  \n  \n---  \nWindows Server registered as a deployment target running a Tentacle| 1 machine\nper tentacle  \nLinux server registered as a deployment target running a Tentacle| 1 machine\nper tentacle  \nSSH connection to Linux Server / MacOS registered as a deployment target| 1\nmachine per SSH connection  \nKubernetes cluster| Not counted as a machine  \nECS clusters| Not counted as a machine  \nAzure Service Fabric cluster| Not counted as a machine  \nAzure web app| Not counted as a machine  \nAzure function| Not counted as a machine  \nOffline package drop| Not counted as a machine  \nCloud region| Not counted as a machine  \n  \n#### Will you count the underlying Windows and Linux hosts in my Kubernetes,\nECS, ACS, or PaaS technology?\n\nNo.\n\nMachines are any Windows, Linux, or MacOS host that Octopus Deploy connects to\nvia a Tentacle or SSH. Kubernetes, ECS, and other platforms abstract away the\nunderlying hosts. Octopus Deploy does not directly connect to them. Often, the\ncloud provider manages them, and you cannot even access them. We luse the\npublic tooling provided by the platforms (APIs, CLIs, etc.) for deployments.\n\n#### Are Octopus Deploy workers counted as machines?\n\nNo. Workers and application hosts serve separate use cases.\n\nApplication hosts are responsible for hosting and running your web\napplication, website, or back-end service. An application host can be a\nWindows or Linux server, a Kubernetes cluster, an ECS cluster, an Azure Web\nApp, an Azure Function, AWS Lambda, and more.\n\nWorkers are delegates who execute tasks on behalf of application hosts.\nThey're the machines that run the scripts, AWS CloudFormation, KubeCTL apply,\nAzure ARM Templates, TerraForm templates, SQL change scripts, and others to\ndeploy to application hosts. They are only used by Octopus Deploy for the\nduration of the deployment.\n\n#### Why are you charging for Windows and Linux application hosts but not\nKubernetes, PaaS, or other hosts?\n\nMany modern application hosts rely on vendor-supplied command-line interfaces\n(CLIs), APIs, and/or desired state. For example, you provide Kubernetes with a\nmanifest file representing your desired state, and Kubernetes figures out the\nrest for you. The value Octopus provides is orchestrating that manifest file,\ncommunicating with multiple clusters, deploying all the components for the\napplication, and ensuring you follow the same process for every deployment.\n\nTraditional Windows and Linux application hosts require custom tooling from\nOctopus Deploy. You need that tooling to communicate with the application\nhosts securely, transfer the build artifacts to those hosts, run all the\nconfiguration and deployment scripts, capture the logs for debugging and\nauditing, and more.\n\n#### Are there any additional changes to Professional or Enterprise?\n\nNo. The only changes to Professional and Enterprise are the units we charge\nfor. All other entitlements and features remain the same.\n\n#### What is the maximum number of units for the Professional tier?\n\nWe recommend no more than 100 projects / 100 tenants / 100 machines on a\nProfessional license.\n\nIf you have more than that, please email sales@octopus.com to discuss your\noptions.\n\n#### What is the minimum number of units for the Enterprise tier?\n\nThe Enterprise tier starts at 100 projects / 0 tenants / 0 machines. However,\nwe know there are use cases where you have a handful of projects with hundreds\nof tenants and machines. Please email sales@octopus.com to discuss your\noptions.\n\n### Octopus Cloud Changes\n\n#### Why are you charging me platform fees?\n\nWe\u2019ve been charging platform fees for quite some time. Month-to-month\ncustomers have been charged an additional $36 per target per year. We rolled\nout platform fees to our Enterprise Cloud customers late last year. The change\nis now a flat platform fee will be applied to all customers on an Octopus\nCloud Professional license.\n\nOctopus Cloud customers are getting value from our cloud platform. We want our\npricing to be a fair exchange of value. That value includes more than just\nhosting. We provide numerous additional services, including automatic\nupgrades, regular backend maintenance, dynamic workers, storage, and\nbandwidth.\n\nHowever, tying the platform fee to the number of targets wasn\u2019t fair to all\ncustomers.\n\nImagine two Octopus Cloud instances with a similar number of projects and\ntenants and a similar number of deployments per day. The hosting\nresources\u2014compute (CPU/RAM/DTUs), backend maintenance, dynamic workers, and\nsupport hours\u2014are the same. However, one instance deploys to hundreds of\nvirtual machines while the other deploys to Kubernetes, ECS, or other\nclustering technologies. The instance deploying to virtual machines would pay\nsubstantially more in platform fees than the other instance deploying to\nKubernetes or ECS.\n\nEven worse, if someone wanted to increase the task cap before the platform\nfees, it would be a substandard customer experience. We would look at their\ninstance\u2019s usage and perform calculations to ensure that the additional month-\nto-month premium covered the increase in cost.\n\nWe wanted a pricing model for the Octopus Cloud platform that was easy to\nunderstand and fair for the majority of use cases.\n\nOne of the most computationally expensive tasks an Octopus Deploy instance can\nperform is deployments and runbook runs. Therefore, we decided to anchor the\nplatform fees to the number of concurrent deployments and runbook runs or the\ntask cap. The higher the task cap, the higher our costs, which in turn\nincreases the platform fees.\n\n#### What if I am on a month-to-month cloud license?\n\nWe'll transition you to an annual license later this year. We're planning for\nthe transition to occur in October 2024. We'll notify you 60 days before the\ntransition date.\n\nIf you want to transition to an annual license today, please contact\nsales@octopus.com.\n\n#### What is the platform fee for Octopus Cloud?\n\nThe platform fee is separate from your license fees.\n\nThe platform fees pay for the following functionality:\n\n  * Hosting the instance with the appropriate resources\n  * 24x7 monitoring and alerting\n  * Automatic upgrades to the latest version of Octopus\n  * Regular maintenance performed on the instance\n  * Automatic instance recovery with support staff to step in to manually restore\n  * Network security and DNS configuration for the Octopus Cloud instance\n  * Windows and Linux dynamic workers.\n  * Bandwidth and storage\n  * File and database backups\n  * Additional backend support and maintenance\n\n#### Why does increasing the task cap, or concurrent tasks, incur an\nadditional fee?\n\nDeployments and runbook runs are among Octopus Deploy's most computationally\nexpensive tasks. More concurrent deployments and runbooks mean more resources\nthe Octopus instance needs from the Octopus Cloud platform.\n\nThat resource increase could come from some or all of these items:\n\n  * CPU / RAM on the Octopus instance\n  * Database resources\n  * File storage\n  * Larger dynamic workers\n  * More frequent dynamic worker usage\n  * More bandwidth\n  * Additional back-end support and maintenance\n\n### Starter tier\n\n#### What are the differences between the Starter and Community tiers?\n\nThe Starter tier is replacing the Community tier. It's designed to provide you\nwith everything you need to get started. Highlighted differences are:\n\n### Community\n\n|\n\n### Starter  \n  \n---|---  \nPrice| $120 / year USD for Cloud. Free for self-hosted.| $360 / year USD (for\nCloud and self-hosted)  \nProject limit| 5| 10  \nTenant limit| No practical limit| 10  \nMachine limit| 5 (targets)| 10  \nUser limit| 5| No practical limit  \nRBAC controls  \nSSO  \nTask cap| 5| 5  \nHigh availability nodesSelf-hosted only| 1| 1  \nInsights| Project only| Project only  \nITSM integration  \nAudit log streaming  \nSupport| Slack Community| Slack Community  \n  \n#### Will you offer a month-to-month Starter tier for Octopus Cloud?\n\nNo. We have no plans to offer a month-to-month Starter tier for Octopus Cloud.\n\n#### Do I have to pay for the Starter tier if I self-host Octopus Deploy?\n\nYes.\n\n#### What if I need an instance of Octopus Deploy for educational purposes,\nlike learning how to use Octopus Deploy for my company?\n\nPlease contact sales@octopus.com to discuss options.\n\n#### What if I have an existing Server Community license?\n\nThat license will be grandfathered. You can continue to renew that license.\nHowever, we will no longer offer new Server Community licenses. There might be\na period of time when you cannot renew via the control center. If that\nhappens, contact support@octopus.com and we will extend the license for you.\n\n#### What if I have an existing Cloud Community license?\n\nYou will be migrated to the Starter license starting October 2024. You will be\nsent an email 60 days before the migration detailing any steps you need to\ntake.\n\n#### What if I need more than 10 projects, 10 tenants, and 10 machines?\n\nYou will be required to move to the Professional tier.\n\n### De-duplicating units\n\n#### Will you de-duplicate projects across spaces?\n\nNo. The name is the only way to identify a project across spaces uniquely. The\nname is a string and is user-configurable. As such, we cannot reliably de-\nduplicate projects across spaces. If the same project exists in multiple\nspaces, we consider it an anti-pattern.\n\n#### Will you de-duplicate tenants across spaces?\n\nNo. This is for the same reason as projects. The name is the only way to\nidentify a tenant across spaces uniquely.\n\n#### Will you de-duplicate machines across spaces?\n\nWhen using Tentacles, yes. We'll use the Tentacle thumbprint, port, and\nhostname to de-duplicate the Tentacle across spaces.\n\n#### Will you de-duplicate projects, tenants, or machines across unique\ninstances?\n\nNo.\n\nAn instance is unique based on the database to which the Octopus Deploy\napplication is connected. Each Octopus Deploy instance has a unique thumbprint\nand installation identifier stored in the database. Those items get created on\ninstallation. Restoring a database backup is not considered an installation;\nthose items get reused from the backup.\n\nThis scenario occurs when two or more unique installs of Octopus Deploy have\nsimilar projects, tenants, and machines.\n\nIf we can't accurately de-duplicate across spaces for projects and tenants,\nit's impossible to do it across instances.\n\nFor Tentacles, that would require the Octopus Deploy instance to \u201cphone home\u201d\na list of all the Tentacles. Our customers have told us that is undesirable.\nHaving multiple unique instances use the same Tentacle is an edge case. The\nTentacles would have to be configured in listening mode, and both instances\nwould have to use the same thumbprint and port.\n\nProduct Features Tenanted deployments Kubernetes deployments Container\ndeployments What's New Octopus and GitHub Octopus and Azure DevOps Octopus and\nJenkins\n\nLearn Getting Started Guides DevOps Handbook Webinars Deployments Runbooks\nTraining Videos\n\nHelp & Support Contact Help & Support Roadmap Community Upgrade & Renew\n\nAbout Us Company Partners Careers Trust center Security Events Stickers & Swag\n\nPrivacy policy GDPR Terms System Status\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Octopus Deploy\n\n", "frontpage": false}
