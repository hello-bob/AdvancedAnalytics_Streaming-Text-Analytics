In particular,\nwe're looking for technical & pragmatic founders who want to build great\nproducts. If you get a thrill from making something that other people love to\nuse, and you understand that building a new product is 1% idea and 99%\niteration, we want to support you.\n\nWait, is this a grant or an investment?\n\nIt is an investment. When we started AI Grant in 2017, we handed out much\nsmaller grants for fundamental research. We awarded grants to 36 individuals,\nwho went on to do important research, and to found companies like Cohere,\nHelia, and Cresta.\n\nFive years later, it seems much has changed: AI research is abundant, but UX\nand product innovation is just getting started, and so we're relaunching the\nprogram with a focus on AI products & investments versus AI papers & grants.\n\nAre larger investments available?\n\nNat and Daniel separately invest in startups, generally leading rounds,\ninvesting between $1M and $100M. Companies that receive larger investments\nwill also have access to the Andromeda Cluster.\n\nWill you fund multiple projects working on the same thing?\n\nYes. We plan to fund many companies; some form of overlap is bound to happen.\nUltimately, we don't think this will be an issue because we strongly believe\nthe AI product market is enormous -- large enough to support both Lyft and\nUber or Bing and Google.\n\nHow will you select the winners?\n\nWe're looking for smart and energetic people with actionable ideas that are\nclearly useful. Demos are a big plus; not just because they're fun to look at,\nbut because they hint at the type of person that cares about the end-user\nexperience, which is ultimately all that matters.\n\nDo I need a company to apply?\n\nNo, but you will need one if you're accepted into the program. We only invest\nin Delaware corporations, but you can create one from almost anywhere in the\nworld with Stripe Atlas (or other programs) in only a few days.\n\nCan I apply if I've raised money already?\n\nYes.\n\nI'm a single founder. Can I apply?\n\nYes.\n\nWho is funding this?\n\nNat and Daniel have invested $10M in AI Grant. The company investments\nthemselves are made by AI Grant LLC. AI Grant is run by Hersh Desai and Asara\nNear.\n\nI love this idea and I want to help! Can I provide additional funding,\nhardware, GPU time, datasets, mentorship, or help reviewing applications?\n\nYes! Thank you for being awesome! If you want to contribute in any way, please\nemail us at sponsorship@aigrant.org.\n\nCan I work at a company you fund?\n\nYes, please fill out the form here and we'll help match you.\n\nI have further questions! How can I reach you?\n\nsupport@aigrant.org\n\n", "frontpage": false}
