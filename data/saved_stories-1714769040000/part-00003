Instead, they\u2019re\ndiverging.\n\n\"Values emphasizing tolerance and self-expression have diverged most sharply,\nespecially between high-income Western countries and the rest of the world.\"\n\nCredit: greenbutterfly / Adobe Stock\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n  * According to a new analysis, societies' values are not converging around notions of personal rights and freedoms. Instead, they're growing further apart. The rift is most pronounced between rich and poor countries.\n  * The world's peoples were particularly less likely to agree on the ethics of homosexuality, euthanasia, divorce, prostitution, and abortion. Residents of wealthy countries grew more comfortable with all those topics, while residents of poorer countries were less so.\n  * Why did the trend towards tolerance and self-expression stall in poorer nations? It's possible that, even though these societies grew richer, their wealth gains remain insecure. Political instability, conflict, and the threat of environmental disasters might cause people to remain more conservative, nationalistic, and distrustful of others.\n\nRoss Pomeroy\n\nShare Globalization was supposed to align the world\u2019s values.

Instead, they\u2019re\ndiverging. on LinkedIn\n\nAt the end of the Cold War, many thinkers optimistically predicted that\nglobalization would cause global societies\u2019 social values to converge around\nliberal notions of personal rights and freedoms. Since then, technology has\nmade the Earth \u201csmaller\u201d than ever. Global trade delivers goods from one\ncorner of the globe to the other. Airlines allow us to travel across oceans in\nhours rather than days or weeks. The internet lets us keep tabs on events\nthousands of miles away, engross ourselves in different cultures, and connect\nwith others almost instantaneously.\n\nAnd yet, according to a new analysis conducted by researchers at the\nUniversity of Chicago, societies\u2019 values are not converging. Instead, they\u2019re\ngrowing further apart. The rift is most pronounced between rich and poor\ncountries.\n\n## Diverging values\n\nJoshua Conrad Jackson, an assistant professor of behavioral science at the\nBooth School of Business, and Dan Medvedev, a final-year PhD student in\nbehavioral science at the Booth School of Business, teamed up for the study,\npublished on April 9 in the journal Nature Communications. Together, they\nscoured through data in the World Values Survey.\n\nEvery five years since 1981, social scientists around the world interview tens\nof thousands of people spread across at least 76 countries. Using a common\nquestionnaire, they ask respondents about their beliefs, values, and\nmotivations. The responses provide a glimpse into the minds of people from all\nsorts of diverse cultures.\n\nJackson and Medvedev found that of the 40 values measured in the survey, 27\nhad diverged between 1981 and 2021. The world\u2019s peoples were particularly less\nlikely to agree on the ethics of homosexuality, euthanasia, divorce,\nprostitution, and abortion. Residents of wealthy countries grew more\ncomfortable with all those topics, while residents of poorer countries were\nless so. This rich-poor value divide also widened on parenting over the past\nfour decades. People from poorer countries valued obedience and religious\nfaith in their kids, while people from wealthier countries placed much less\nimportance on those two qualities.\n\nTo showcase the diverging values between rich and poor countries, Jackson and\nMedvedev cited Pakistan and Australia. In 1981, 39% of Australians said\nchildhood obedience was important and 45% said divorce was justifiable. That\nsame year, 32% and 10% of Pakistanis respectively agreed with those\nstatements. In 2021, only 18% of Australians compared to 49% of Pakistanis\nsaid childhood obedience was important, while 74% of Australians and 15% of\nPakistanis viewed divorce as justifiable.\n\nIn an additional analysis, the authors found that GDP per capita was the\ngreatest predictor of aligning social values. Frequent trade, geographic\nproximity, and religious similarity also contributed, albeit to a much lesser\nextent.\n\nOver the study period, pretty much every country grew wealthier. In 1981 over\n40% of the world\u2019s population lived in extreme poverty. That proportion is\nless than 8% today. Over that time, most countries\u2019 social values tended to\ngrow more tolerant, secular, and individualistic \u2014 in short, more Westernized.\nSo in that sense, the globalist predictions from decades ago were correct.\nIt\u2019s just that citizens of wealthier countries tended to follow that trend to\na far greater extent than citizens of the poorest nations.\n\n## Accounting for the divide\n\nWhy did the trend stall in less-well-off countries? It\u2019s possible that, even\nthough these societies grew richer, their wealth gains remain insecure.\nPolitical instability, conflict, and the threat of environmental disasters\nmight cause people to remain more conservative, nationalistic, and distrustful\nof others.\n\nAuthoritarian governments also may be putting up roadblocks. These regimes,\nparticularly in Iran, Russia, and China, speak out forcefully against Western\nvalues.\n\n\u201cRussia has framed the recent war in Ukraine as a war against Western values,\u201d\nthe authors noted. \u201cChinese politicians have spoken against countries that\n\u2018forcibly promote the concept and system of Western democracy and human\nrights.'\u201d\n\nThe researchers cautioned that their study might actually be too short to\ninform us of any grand changes in human values. After all, human civilization\nhas been around for roughly 10,000 years. This study only covered 0.4% of it.\n\n\u201cIt may be that our findings are specific to a particular period of time\nfollowing decolonization and the end of the Cold War and that we would have\nfound different results at different periods of time,\u201d Jackson and Medvedev\nwrote. \u201cOnly time will tell if our findings represent a general cultural trend\nor a historically isolated phenomenon.\u201d\n\nTags\n\ncultureEthicsgeopoliticssociology\n\nIn this article\n\ncultureEthicsgeopoliticssociology\n\nRelated\n\nThinking\n\nWhy do we value human life?\n\nWe value human life in a way that assumes we possess a sacred something not\nfound in beings like lambs, turkeys, or mosquitoes.\n\nCritical Thinking\n\nHow should human values shape the future of AI?\n\nThere\u2019s a fortune to be made in data and silicon, and everyone is out for\ntheir share.
