Work in Progress !!\n\nHello! I'm Ben, a software engineer who's fond of the Gleam programming\nlanguage interested in learning OTP.\n\nIf you haven't heard:\n\n  * Gleam is a programming language that is statically typed, has great tooling, and an even better community.\n  * Gleam can compile to Erlang or JavaScript, depending on your needs. Because the concurrency models of these languages are fundamentally different, concurrency is handled at the library level.\n  * Erlang is sorta famous for its concurrency model, as well as it's standard framework for building concurrent applications: OTP. (Note: This isn't research stuff, Erlang is extremely battle tested. It runs a lot of places, and it was estimated in 2019 that \"... 90% of all internet traffic going through routers and switches controlled by Erlang.\" source)\n  * Gleam has a package for using the OTP framework, called gleam_otp. It also has a package for more fundamental Erlang specific concepts, gleam_erlang.\n\nI want to use these to build bad ass fault tolerant concurrent software!! But\nfirst, I need to learn OTP, which means I'll be learning with resources\nwritten in Erlang (one could also choose Elixir, but I'm #notlikeotherdevs).\n\nWhile I go on this journey, I'm going to do my damndest to translate the\nthings I learn to Gleam, and record them here, so that in the future this repo\nmight serve as the base for learning OTP with Gleam.\n\n### Using this resource\n\nThis resource presumes ALOT of prerequisite knowledge in it's users.\n\n  1. You kinda know what Erlang concurrency and OTP is about/why it's good. If you've yet to drink the Kool-aid, allow me to provide some: The Soul of Erlang and Elixir talk\n  2. You are familiar w/Gleam syntax. Gleam has a very small set of language features that all work well together. It takes the idea of having only one way to do something pretty seriously, and as such is really quick to learn. If you have never seen Gleam, try out the interactive tour, or follow the Syllabus on Exercism.\n\nEach section is broken into it's own module, some sections with submodules.\nYou can read them in the order you like, but I recommend 1.\nconcurrency_primitives 2. tasks 3. actors 4. supervisors\n\nAll the code in this project is runnable, just run gleam run -m <module_name>.\nFeel free to clone the repo and tinker with the code!\n\n## About\n\nA resource for learning the OTP framework with the Gleam programming language\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n65 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n7 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n0 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n  * Gleam 100.0%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
