It does so by ranking all ships\nglobally on an A to E rating (A being the best, E being the worst). Ship\nemission intensity calculations consider a mixture of weight, distance\ntravelled in the calendar year, and the fuel used in their main engines (for a\ncomprehensive explanation, see the methodology section).\n\nGrades are re-calculated annually. The boundaries of what is considered \"good\"\nis a moving target, described in table 4. This moving target is intended to\nencourage shipping firms to constantly improve the carbon intensity of their\nships to 2030. The graph below demonstrates the gradual tightening of the\nIMO's Carbon Intensity requirements over time. The nearer to 2030, the lower a\nship's Attained CII must be to achieve an A grade.\n\nThe specification for this software can be found in IMO's resolution\nMEPC.354(78), adopted in June 2022. Additional references, summaries, &\nresolutions can be found in the References & datasets section.\n\nNote\n\nThe repository code & software is provided as-is. While best-efforts are made\nto ensure its results are acurate inline with the IMO's CII specifications,\nthe results it produces are estimates and guidance. Results should not be\nconsidered proof of regulatory compliance.\n\n# Table of Contents\n\n  * Open IMO Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) Calculator \ud83d\udea2\n\n    * What is this?\n  * Table of Contents\n  * Software\n\n    * Software Roadmap\n    * Getting Started\n\n      * Calculator Result Format\n  * Methodology\n\n    * Ship Grade Ratio Methodology\n\n      * Ship Grade Worked example\n    * Ship Attained Carbon Intensity Methodology\n    * Ship transport work methodology\n    * Ship CO2 Emissions Methodology\n    * Ship Capacity Methodology\n  * Reference Tables\n\n    * Table 1: MEPC.353(78) - Shipping Capacity Tables\n    * Table 2: MEPC.364(79) Mass Conversion between fuel consumption and CO2 emissions\n    * Table 3: MEPC.339(76) - Ship Grading Boundaries\n    * Table 4: Annual Carbon Reduction Factors (Z%)\n    * Table 5: Common shipping measurement conversions\n  * Shipping Terminology & Glossary\n  * References & datasets\n\n    * Further Reading\n    * Useful datasets (mixed public and private)\n\n# Software\n\n## Software Roadmap\n\nThe following features are on the roadmap for the application:\n\n  * Support for Dependency Injection (DI). Currently the application does not\n  * Support for IMO Resolution MEPC.355(78). Currently the application considers fuel consumption only. Support for MEPC355(78) will bring additional CII properties, for example the lighting in crew quarters.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThe library can be installed via Nuget. There is a C# dotnet console app at\nEtiveMor.OpenImoCiiCalculator.DemoConsoleApp, which demonstrates how to create\na new instance of the calculator, submit data, and receive results in the\nformat EtiveMor.OpenImoCiiCalculator.Core.ModelsCalculationResult.\n\nWhen submitting data to the CalculateAttainedCiiRating method, the following\nparameters are required:\n\n    \n    \n    ShipType shipType, double grossTonnage, double deadweightTonnage, double distanceTravelled, TypeOfFuel fuelType, double fuelConsumption, int targetYear\n\n  * The ship's type must be one of EtiveMor.OpenImoCiiCalculator.Core.Models.Enums.ShipType.\n  * Gross Tonnage is measured in long-tons (1.016047 metric tonnes, or 1,016.047 kilograms)\n  * Deadweight Tonnage is measured in long-tons (1.016047 metric tonnes, or 1,016.047 kilograms)\n  * Distance travelled is measured in nautical miles (1,852 metres)\n  * Fuel type must be one of EtiveMor.OpenImoCiiCalculator.Core.Models.Enums.TypeOfFuel\n  * Fuel consumption is measured in grams, and accepts scientific notation like 1.9e+10\n  * Year must refer to the measured year. For example, if a ship's fuel consumption is known in 2022, all other results will be based from that point\n\nMultiple Fuel Type calculations\n\nThere are two CalculateAttainedCiiRating methods. One for a ship which\nconsumes a single fuel type, and another which consumes multiple fuel types.\nBoth methods are available at CalculateAttainedCiiRating.\n\n### Calculator Result Format\n\n    \n    \n    { \"results\": [ { \"isMeasuredYear\": true, \"isEstimatedYear\": false, \"year\": 2019, \"rating\": 2, \"requiredCii\": 19.184190519387734, \"attainedCii\": 16.243733333333335, \"attainedRequiredRatio\": 0.8467249799733408, \"calculatedCo2eEmissions\": 60914000000.0, \"calculatedShipCapacity\": 25000.0, \"calculatedTransportWork\": 3750000000.0, \"vectorBoundariesForYear\": { \"year\": 2019, \"shipType\": 110, \"weightClassification\": { \"upperLimit\": 0, \"lowerLimit\": 2147483647 }, \"capacityUnit\": 3, \"boundaryDdVectors\": { \"Superior\": 14.579984794734678, \"Lower\": 17.649455277836715, \"Upper\": 21.869977192102013, \"Inferior\": 24.939447675204054 } } }, ... ] }\n\nProperty| Description  \n---|---  \nisMeasuredYear| describes if the result array was generated based on this year  \nisEstimatedYear| describes if the result array was NOT generated based on this\nyear (is always equal to !isMeasuredYear)  \nyear| describes the year in question  \nrating| describes the rating for the ship in the given year.

The ship's Attained CII is the product of\nits and the in one calendar year.\n\nShips are split into 12 categories, for example \"Bulk Carrier\", \"Tanker\",\n\"Cruise Passenger Ship\" among others (see Table 1 for a comprehensive list). A\nship is compared internally among its category peers but never across\ncategories, for example, a Bulk Carrier is not directly comparable to a LNG\nCarrier in this system.\n\nInputs\n\n  * The type of ship\n  * The type of fuel used by the ship's main engine\n  * The capacity of the ship, measured in either Deadweight Tonnage (DWT) or Gross Tonnage (GT)\n  * The distance travelled by the ship in one calendar year, measured in nautical miles\n\nThe ship's Attained CII is then compared to its Required CII to produce an\neasy to understand grade for the ship. The grading scheme is in the range A to\nE, where A is the most efficient bracket, C represents a ship at-or-near its\nCII, and E is the least efficient.\n\nGrade| Description  \n---|---  \nA| CII below the Superior Boundary  \nB| CII above the Superior Boundary and below the Lower Boundary  \nC| CII between the Lower Boundary and the Upper Boundary  \nD| CII above the Upper Boundary and below the Inferior Boundary  \nE| CII above the Inferior Boundary  \n  \nFig1. IMO Boundaries, after IMO MEPC.354(78)\n\n## Ship Grade Ratio Methodology\n\nA ship's grade is calculated by comparing its Attained CII to its Required CII\nto give its performance ratio. If the ship's ratio falls below the boundary\nfor its class of Ship Type, it attains a higher (better) grade. Boundaries are\ncalculated as:\n\n> .\n\n### Ship Grade Worked example\n\nThe worked example below considers a Bulk Carrier, with a Deadweight Tonnage\nbelow 279,000. Assuming the Bulk Carrier's is:\n\nImportant\n\nFor some ship types, should be used instead of , see Table 1 and transport\nwork done methodology for a comprehensive guide.\n\nThen the boundaries are calculated with:\n\n  * .\n\nThe rating boundaries for each ship type can be found in Table 3. The\nresultant boundaries for the Bulk Carrier in question are:\n\nBoundary Type| Required CII| Boundary's Lower Threshold  \n---|---|---  \nSuperior  \nLower  \nUpper  \nInferior  \n  \nGrades are then derived from these boundaries, by comparing the ship's\nAttained CII to the thresholds across a given calendar year:\n\nGrade| Higher than| Lower than| Description  \n---|---|---|---  \nA| 8.6| Below Superior Boundary  \nB| 8.6| 9.4| Above Superior Boundary, Below Lower Boundary  \nC| 9.4| 10.6| Above Lower Boundary, Below Upper Boundary  \nD| 10.6| 11.8| Above Upper Boundary, Below Inferior Boundary  \nE| 11.8| Above Inferior Boundary  \n  \nExample Results:\n\n  * If the ship's Attained CII was , the ship receives a grade B, as its Attained CII was above the threshold for Superior Boundary, but below the threshold for Lower Boundary.\n  * If the ship's Attained CII was , the ship receives a grade D, as its Attained CII was above the threshold for Upper Boundary, but below the threshold for Inferior Boundary.\n\n## Ship Attained Carbon Intensity Methodology\n\nA ship's Attained carbon intensity is calculated by taking the mass of its\naggregate CO_2 emissions in a calendar year, and multiplying it by its\ntransport work done in the calendar year.\n\nMethod accepts:\n\n  * massOfCo2Emissions, the mass of emissions in the calendar year\n\n    * See co2 emissions methodology to calculate\n  * transportWork, the work carried out by the ship in the calendar year\n\n    * See transport work methodology to calculate\n\nMethod Returns:\n\n  * A double representing the ship's Attained Carbon Intensity\n\nImplementation:\n\nReturns the product of a ship's mass of emissions and its .\n\n## Ship transport work methodology\n\nA ship's transport work is calculated by taking its capacity and multiplying\nit by the distance sailed in nautical miles in the calendar year.\n\nMethod accepts:\n\n  * capacity the ship's capacity for cargo or passengers\n\n    * See ship capacity methodology to calculate\n  * distanceSailed the distance sailed in Nautical Miles in the calendar year\n\nImplementation:\n\nReturns the product of a ship's capacity and its distance sailed\n\n## Ship CO_2 Emissions Methodology\n\nThe sum of a ship's emissions over a given year are calculated by multiplying\nthe mass of consumed fuel by the fuel's emissions factor. If the ship consumes\nmultiple fuel types, the calculation is repeated for each fuel type &\nconsumption mass, then those results are summed together.\n\nMethod Accepts:\n\n  * fuelType, an enum derrived from Table 2's Fuel Type column\n  * fuelConsumptionMass, a double representing the mass of fuel consumed in grams (g) over the given year\n\nMethod Returns:\n\n  * A double representing the mass of emitted by the ship across one calendar year\n\nImplementation:\n\nThe sum of emissions from fuel consumption in a given calendar year is\n\nWhere:\n\n  * is the fuel type\n  * is the mass in grams of the consumed fuel type j in one calendar year\n  * is the fuel oil mass to CO2 mass conversion factor, given in Table 2's column\n\n## Ship Capacity Methodology\n\nA ship's capacity is measured by either its Deadweight Tonnage (DWT) or Gross\nTonnage (GT). The only exception is Bulk Carriers, which have a capacity\ncapped at 279,000.\n\nTo calculate a ship's Capacity in accordance with the IMO's MEPC353(78)\nguidelines:\n\nMethod accepts:\n\n  * shipType, an enum, derrived from Table 1's Ship Type column\n  * deadweightTonnage, the deadweight tonnage of the ship, provided in long tons\n  * grossTonnage, the gross tonnage of the ship, provided in long tons\n\nMethod returns:\n\n  * a double representing the ship's capacity in imperial long tons\n\nImplementation:\n\nof a given ship is calculated using the following rules:\n\n  * If the ship is a Bulk Carrier, and its DWT is 279,000 or above, its capacity is capped at 279,000\n  * If the ship is a Bulk Carrier, and its DWT is below 279,000, its capacity is equal to its DWT\n  * If the ship is a Ro-ro cargo ship (vehicle carrier), a Ro-ro passenger ship or a Cruise passenger ship, its capacity is equal to its Gross Tonnage\n  * Otherwise, the ships capacity is equal to its DWT\n\nThe full implementation detail can be found in Table 1's Ship Type, Ship\nweight, and Capacity columns.\n\nExceptions:\n\n  * ArgumentOutOfRangeException is thrown if the DWT is set to 0, when ship type is set to anything other than Ro-ro cargo ship (vehicle carrier), Ro-ro passenger ship or Cruise passenger ship\n  * ArgumentOutOfRangeException is thrown if the GT is set to 0, when ship type is set to Ro-ro cargo ship (vehicle carrier), Ro-ro passenger ship or Cruise passenger ship\n\n# Reference Tables\n\n## Table 1: MEPC.353(78) - Shipping Capacity Tables\n\nThe following table describes how to determine a given ship type's Capacity.\n\nTable Source: IMO: MEPC.353(78)\n\nShip Type| Conditional Specification| Capacity  \n---|---|---  \nBulk carrier| 279,000 DWT and above| 279,000| 4,745| 0.622  \nBulk carrier| Less than 279,000 DWT| DWT| 4,745| 0.622  \nGas carrier| 65,000 and above| DWT| 14405E7| 2.071  \nGas carrier| Less than 65,000 DWT| DWT| 8,104| 0.639  \nTanker| DWT| 5,247| 0.610  \nContainer Ship| DWT| 1,984| 0.489  \nGeneral cargo ship| 20,000 DWT and above| DWT| 31,948| 0.792  \nGeneral cargo ship| Less than 20,000 DWT| DWT| 588| 0.3885  \nRefrigerated cargo carrier| DWT| 4,600| 0.557  \nCombination carrier| DWT| 5,119| 0.622  \nLNG Carrier| 100,000 DWT and above| DWT| 9.827| 0.000  \nLNG Carrier| 65,000 and above, less than 100,000| DWT| 14479E10| 2.673  \nLNG Carrier| less than 65,000 DWT| DWT| 14779E10| 2.673  \nRo-ro cargo ship (vehicle carrier)| 57,700 and above| 57,000| 3,627| 0.590  \nRo-ro cargo ship (vehicle carrier)| 30,000 and above, less than 57,700| 3627|\n5,739| 0.590  \nRo-ro cargo ship (vehicle carrier)| less than 30,000| GT| 330| 0.329  \nRo-ro cargo ship| GT| 1,967| 0.485  \nRo-ro passenger ship| Ro-ro passenger ship| GT| 2,023| 0.460  \nRo-ro passenger ship| High-speed craft designed to SOLAS chapter X| GT| 4,196|\n0.460  \nCruise passenger ship| GT| 930| 0.383  \n  \n## Table 2: MEPC.364(79) Mass Conversion between fuel consumption and CO_2\nemissions\n\nThe following table describes how to convert from the fuel used by a ship's\nmain engine to the amount of produced.
