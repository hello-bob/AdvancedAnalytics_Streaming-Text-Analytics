I'm still learning! I'm sorry :( I\nreally liked the riff I wrote for the intro since it has a time signature of\n7/4 but I got carried away a bit... Let's spin up a server a simpler way.I'm\nexperimenting with some background music, let me know what you think.In this\nvideo I will be showing how to use fundamentals to spin up a server, replacing\ncloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud Provider and Microsoft Azure with\nLinux, Docker and Git. For many applications, the tools we use are grossly\nover-engineered. I'm trying to force myself to rethink my approach and use\nsimpler tools. Hosting this server is part of that.\n\nShow less Show more\n\nTranscript\n\nFollow along using the transcript.\n\n### Tom Delalande\n\n8.29K subscribers\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\nTwitter\n\n## Comments 373\n\nTop comments\n\nNewest first\n\n## Transcript\n\nNaN / NaN\n\n# The cloud is over-engineered and overpriced (no music)\n\nTom Delalande\n\nTom Delalande\n\n8.29K subscribers\n\n<__slot-el>\n\n<__slot-el>\n\nDownload\n\n81K views 5 days ago\n\n81,256 views \u2022 Apr 25, 2024\n\n#### License\n\nCreative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed)\n\nShow less\n\nI tried the music and the feedback is clear enough that I think it's worth\nuploading a version of this with no music.
