What a milestone achievement for such a\nculturally relevant anime. I want to do something special to celebrate\u2014a deep\ndive into the sequels that never came to fruition. This article will replace\nmy outdated What do we know about Turn A Space? article, but I\u2019ll leave the\nlink active and redirect readers to this page. Bear in mind that this is a\nwork-in-progress. New details will continue to surface as time goes on, but I\nfigured I had accumulated enough to write an updated article.\n\nOn August 10, 1999, while Turn A Gundam was in-between episodes #18 and #19,\nDirector Yoshiyuki Tomino was informed by Sunrise producer Masuo Ueda that\nTurn A Gundam would NOT be greenlit for a second year of broadcast. A sequel\nstory had never officially been in the cards, but Tomino had hoped that one\nwould be made. He had already been planning scenario ideas, after all, and\nthis news didn\u2019t necessarily stop him from continuing to expand on them. In\nfact, planning documents and memos for a sequel concept were on display at The\nWorld of Yoshiyuki Tomino exhibition (2019-2021). Sadly, due to photography\nlimitations, photos haven\u2019t surfaced on the internet.\n\nContinue reading \u201cThe Legacies of the Turn A Gundam Sequel(s) That Never Came\nto Fruition\u201d \u2192\n\nanimation\n\n# An Overview of Turn A Gundam\u2019s Animation Directors\n\nApril 6, 2024 FeezLeave a comment\n\nAn Animation Director (\u4f5c\u753b\u76e3\u7763, sakuga kantoku) or AD, colloquially known as\nsakkan (\u4f5c\u76e3) in Japanese, is responsible for maintaining the quality and\nconsistency of the animation of an episode. They may manually revise key\nframes and layouts to match a certain level of quality, and/or give\ninstructions to key animators to correct their drawings. Animation directors\ncan be broken down into subcategories like Character Animation Director or\nMecha Animation Director. In Turn A Gundam, this level of distinction is only\nmade in a handful of episodes.\n\nThere\u2019s a trend in the sakuga community to make what\u2019s called an \u201cAD Chart\u201d,\nbasically showcasing characters drawn in each AD\u2019s style in an easily-\ndigestible chart. This highlights the differences in how the characters are\ndrawn throughout the show. It\u2019s a fun little activity, so I\u2019ve created one for\nTurn A Gundam. I\u2019ve also included a brief introduction of each animation\ndirector, along with the episodes that they worked on. Do note that this chart\ndoesn\u2019t include every AD on the show\u2014for instance, Masami Goto was mecha\nanimation director on a few episodes, and Atsushi Shigeta\u2019s overarching\ninvolvement is largely uncredited.\n\nContinue reading \u201cAn Overview of Turn A Gundam\u2019s Animation Directors\u201d \u2192\n\nAnalysis\n\n# An Analysis of the Dark History and Correct Century Timeline\n\nMarch 2, 2024March 3, 2024 Feez1 Comment\n\nMy goal with this article is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the Dark\nHistory and Correct Century timeline as thematic concepts, and to examine\ntheir legacies. The Dark History tends to find itself in never-ending fandom\ndiscourse, so I hope this article serves as a useful reference.\n\nThe Dark History is a term used to denote the history of wars that were\nrepeatedly fought during the Space Age. These eras had names like the\nUniversal Century, Future Colony, After Colony, and After War, and after\ncountless years of war and destruction they would become memories sealed from\nhuman consciousness. Turn A Gundam is set in the \u201cCorrect Century\u201d, thousands\nof years after the last catastrophe of the Dark History, in which nanomachine-\npowered Gundams devastated the Earth\u2019s surface and annihilated most of the\npopulation. During this catastrophe, a nation of people escaped from Earth to\nsettle on the Moon. The remaining humans on Earth have since recovered to the\nlevel before the Industrial Revolution, and traces of Dark History technology\nremain buried underground. This is the basic premise of Turn A Gundam\u2018s\ntimeline.\n\nDianna Soreil unveils and examines the Dark History archives.

As part of the GUNDAM FAN e-FESTIVAL 2023, both Turn A Gundam (TV)\nand G-Reco (movies) are available to stream via Gundam Info\u2019s YouTube channel.\nThis is only for a limited time (November 23 \u2013 December 10), so take advantage\nof it while you can. Please note that it is region-locked to U.S. audiences\nonly. Gundam Info held an online poll to decide which two Gundam titles would\nbe streamed as part of the event, and Turn A and G-Reco won, for TV series and\nmovies respectively! While this technically isn\u2019t the first time Turn A has\nbeen on streaming services (it had a brief stint on Daisuki), it hasn\u2019t been\nreadily accessible for ages. Similarly, G-Reco (TV) was only ever streamed on\nAustralian-service AnimeLab, and some of the movies have appeared on Gundam\nInfo\u2014but this is the first time all five are available to stream for U.S.\naudiences. Hopefully the demand and positivity from the community will be\nnoticed by Bandai and these two shows will become permanent fixtures on\nstreaming services in the future, in all major regions.\n\nTurn A Gundam (TV) full playlist\n\nG-Reco (movies) full playlist\n\nContinue reading \u201cTurn A Gundam & G-Reco now available to stream as part of\nthe GUNDAM FAN e-FESTIVAL 2023 (limited time)\u201d \u2192\n\nakiman \u00b7 Interviews\n\n# Newtype Magazine (09/1999) \u2013 Interview with Akira Yasuda\n\nNovember 21, 2023 FeezLeave a comment\n\nThe following is a translation from the September 1999 issue of Newtype\nMagazine.
