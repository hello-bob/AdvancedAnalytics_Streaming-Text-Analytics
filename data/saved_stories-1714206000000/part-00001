Join our Discord to meet the\nauthor and connect with other developers passionate about Code Search and AI!\n\nSIMD, Single Instruction Multiple Data, is a way of speeding up\ncomputationally intensive tasks by applying the same operation to multiple\ndata items in one go. For this to be applicable, some requirements need to be\nmet, such as data layout or access patterns.\n\nIn OpenRCT2 (free and open source remake of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2) we care a\nlot about performance and there\u2019s long been a piece of code I suspected could\nbe improved by applying the SIMD approach. I\u2019ve been putting it off due to\nhaving to write a lot of code that probably wouldn\u2019t make it to the\nrepository, but I found Cody doesn\u2019t complain about any of that and it\ndutifully came to help.\n\nThe code in question is used for arranging paint order and implements checking\nof bounding box intersections. With a single click of Explain Code, Cody\nexplains in detail the responsibilities of this function:\n\nBefore we start changing anything, let's generate some tests. With the\nfunction still highlighted, that's just one more click on Generate Unit Tests.\n\nCody explained it didn\u2019t know what testing framework I used and assumed\n(correctly, as many C++ projects do) that I use GoogleTest. It then proceeded\nto generate test cases for all available scenarios. After a minor cleanup from\nthe comments left in the code, I had my tests ready. The template was\ncorrectly recognized and had tests generated. The inclusion of a .cpp file\ninstead of .h surprised me, but it was the correct approach for testing a\nstatic function without having to remove the modifier.\n\nHelpful instructions on how to set up the tests with my project are easily\nprovided\n\nPrompt: How do I compile tests in TestPaint.cpp\n\nThe first rule of performance tuning is you need to have data to verify your\nassumptions and measure any gains or losses. Using the prompt Please write\nGoogle Benchmark for highlighted code opened a new file filled with a simple\nbenchmark I could use as a starting point.\n\nPrompt: Please write Google Benchmark for highlighted code\n\nWith all the tests and benchmarks at the ready, let\u2019s actually apply some\nSIMD. Rewrite selected function with x86 SIMD intrinsics implemented what I\nlong had in mind.\n\nCody delivers:\n\nWith tests passing, let\u2019s see what kind of performance improvements this\ndelivers:\n\nThat doesn\u2019t look quite right. 3x slower than original code. Let\u2019s have Cody\nexplain what\u2019s wrong with this approach: Can you explain why the highlighted\nSIMD code is slower than its scalar equivalent in function\nCheckBoundingBoxScalar?\n\nOK, that\u2019s a lot of useful information. It seems the code isn\u2019t bottlenecked\non the ALU (arithmetic logic unit), but on memory instead. But then again,\nCody mentioned the prefetch effectiveness depends on various factors and I\u2019ve\ndecided to test if moving the prefetch to a place earlier in the paint\nordering loop would improve performance.\n\nUsing another benchmark implemented earlier and a known performance-sensitive\nmap, the code with no prefetch results are:\n\nAnd with prefetch implemented:\n\nA ~5% win, for something that initially had been 3x slower! I\u2019m happy with\nthat result. Cody helped me finally find the bottleneck and implement a decent\nimprovement. You can check the merged PR here.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSIMD optimizations can be a powerful tool for improving performance, but it's\ncrucial to understand the underlying bottlenecks and test assumptions\nthoroughly. With the assistance of AI tools like Cody, developers can\nstreamline the process of writing tests, benchmarks, and optimized code,\nultimately leading to better performance gains.
