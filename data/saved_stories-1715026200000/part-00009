An unusually warm and sunny spring day with a temperature reaching\ntwenty degrees centigrade.\n\nThe curl up 2024 weekend started excellently and the following morning we all\nsqueezed ourselves into a conference room in downtown Stockholm. I had rented\na room in a hotel in the city center for two days.\n\ncurl up is never a big meeting/conference but we have in the past sometimes\nbeen around twenty-five attendees. This year\u2019s amount of fifteen was the\nsmallest so far, but in this small set of people we have a set of long-term\nwell-known curl contributors. It is not a big list of attendees that creates a\ngood curl up.\n\n## Swag\n\nWe started by making sure every attendee got their needs of curl t-shirts,\ncurl mugs, curl stickers and curl coasters satisfied. The t-shirts of the year\nare \u201cforest green\u201d with the curl logo in white on the front and the curl\nsymbol slightly larger on the back.\n\nI have spare t-shirts that I intend to distribute to people I meet over the\ncoming year. Before you ask: no, there is no way to buy these.\n\n## Recordings\n\nI had tested my external microphone setup at home but it just refused to work\nwhen at the venue. We struggled for a while until we had to surrender and fall\nback to using the built-in microphone in the webcam that we used for recording\nthe video. This is why the sound is low in all recordings we did. A little\ndisappointing. Sorry for this.\n\nI live-streamed the entire event over twitch. We had in total over 460 unique\nviewers over the days and at times at least we had over 30 concurrent\nsustained viewers. This made us at least sometimes have twice the size\naudience online as in the room. In spite of the sound issue.\n\nI also noticed that my trusty old laptop was maybe a little weak for this\npurpose as it struggled to stream and save the recordings at high frame rates.\n\nI brought: two laptops, webcam on stand, mike, mike-stand, power for laptops,\ncable kit, repair kit, 12 curl mugs, eight packs with different curl stickers,\ncarton coasters, pcb coasters, t-shirts, name tags + pens, two UCB-C to HDMI\nadapters.\n\n## Day one\n\n## The state of curl 2024\n\nWhere are we, what did we do last year or so? Who did the work? How often? How\nmuch?\n\n## Evolutions\n\nApparently this is not a real word, but Stefan Eissing pushes for language\ndevelopment in this presentation where he talks about changes and improvements\nhe worked on in curl over the last few years.\n\n## Fuzzing curl\n\nJames Fuller talks about his work on generating \u201cfun\u201d curl command lines in\norder to find those that might not be handled correctly.\n\n## Implementing parallel testing\n\nDan Fandrich talks about the journey from serial to fully parallel tests in\ncurl.\n\n## curl containers\n\nJames is back and talks about where the curl containers are right now.\n\n## Security\n\nI talk about the security situation in curl as of right now and the last year.\n\n## End of day 1\n\nWe topped off this packed day with a twenty minute walk through a sunny\nStockholm down to the water where we could sit outside and have a few drinks\nbefore we moved over to the restaurant where we ended the evening with a joint\ndinner. A great first day!\n\n## Day two\n\nThe nice weather was gone. The temperature dropped ten degrees and the rain\npoured down most of this day.\n\n## HTTP/1/2/3 Performance\n\nStefan Eissing warms up the day. About his work on HTTP refactors and related\nperformance improvements.\n\n## trurl\n\nThis is the newcomer in the curl family and I talked a little about what it is\nand why it exists.\n\n## Apple Specialties\n\nChristian has improved curl on Apple devices, which he talks about.\n\n## rust in curl\n\nYou can build curl to use third party components written in rust. This is\nwhere we are now and what might happen next. Or not.\n\n## Test clutch\n\nDan talks about his work on improving curl tests and their reliability.\n\n## Future\n\nWe don\u2019t know much about the future but there are some plans and there are at\nleast some ideas...\n\n## End of curl up 2024\n\nThe rest of day two was mostly spent hanging out and talking about life, the\nuniverse and various things curl. People started leaving and by five o\u2019clock\nwe shut the door for the last time this time around. We had survived curl up\n2024.\n\nAfter all these talks, discussions, dinners, beers, coffees, challenging\nquestions, brainstorms over 48 hours, I was exhausted and drained of energy.\nApart from the recording problem, I think almost everything else in the event\norganization went as smoothly as we could have wished for. The venue, the\nfood, the coffee etc worked perfectly for us.\n\n## Planning ahead for 2025\n\nWe will most certainly run another curl up event in 2025 in roughly the same\nframe of the year as we did now. The idea is then to visit another capital\ncity in Europe. Stay tuned for coming announcements of date and location for\nthat.\n\ncURL and libcurlcurlup\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
