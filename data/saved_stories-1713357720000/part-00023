The world needs GenAI and vectors as part of a general purpose RDBMS,\n> and we have already demonstrated our ability to deliver this through MariaDB\n> Server. We see huge opportunities for core MariaDB users - and users of the\n> related MySQL Server \u2013 to build RAG solutions. It's logical to keep the\n> source data, the AI vector data, and the output data in one and the same\n> RDBMS.

Advocating\n> for a foundation of open source and standards - from datasets to formats to\n> APIs and models, enables organizations and enterprises to build\n> transparently. The AI data infrastructure must also be built on these open\n> principles. Only by having open source and open standard solutions, from\n> models to infrastructure and down to the data are we able to create trust,\n> ensure transparency and promote accountability.\n>\n> AB PeriasamyCEO and co-Founder, MinIO\n\n> \u201c\n>\n> As the leading open-source vector database technology provider, Qdrant is\n> excited to support the launch of the OPEA, underscoring the importance of\n> open standards in AI for innovation and data sovereignty.
