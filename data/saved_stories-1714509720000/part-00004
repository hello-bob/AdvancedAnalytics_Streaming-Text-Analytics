(Danny Owen/Nicola Baresi)\n\nWhen a spacecraft arrives at its destination, it settles into an orbit for\nscience operations. But after the primary mission is complete, there might be\nother interesting orbits where scientists would like to explore. Maneuvering\nto a different orbit requires fuel, limiting a spacecraft's number of\nmaneuvers.\n\nResearchers have discovered that some orbital paths allow for no-fuel orbital\nchanges. But the figuring out these paths also are computationally expensive.\n\nKnot theory has been shown to find these pathways more easily, allowing the\nmost fuel-efficient routes to be plotted. This is similar to how our GPS\nmapping software plots the most efficient routes for us here on Earth.\n\nIn mathematics, knot theory is the study of closed curves in three dimensions.\nThink of it as looking at a knotted necklace or a tangle of fishing line, and\nfiguring out how to untangle them in the most efficient manner.\n\nIn the same way, a spacecraft's path could be computed in a crowded planetary\nsystem \u2013 around Jupiter and all its moons, for example \u2013 where the best,\nsimplest and least tangled route could be computed mathematically.\n\nAccording to a new paper in the journal Astrodynamics, \"Applications of knot\ntheory to the detection of heteroclinic connections between quasi-periodic\norbits,\" using knot theory to untangle complicated spacecraft routes would\ndecrease the amount of computer power or just plain guesswork in plotting out\nchanges in spacecraft orbits.\n\n\"Previously, when the likes of NASA wanted to plot a route, their calculations\nrelied on either brute force or guesswork,\" said Danny Owen, a postgraduate\nresearch student in astrodynamics, in a press release from the University of\nSurrey. \"Our new technique neatly reveals all possible routes a spacecraft\ncould take from A to B, as long as both orbits share a common energy level.\"\n\nOwen added that this new process makes the task of planning missions much\nsimpler. \"We think of it as a tube [subway] map for space,\" he said.\n\nSpacecraft navigation is complicated by the fact that nothing in space is a\nfixed position. Navigators must meet the challenges of calculating the exact\nspeeds and orientations of a rotating Earth, a rotating target destination, as\nwell as a moving spacecraft, while all are simultaneously traveling in their\nown orbits around the Sun.\n\nSince fuel is a limited resource for most missions, it would be beneficial to\nrequire the least amount of fuel possible in making any changes to the course\nof a spacecraft in orbit.\n\nSpacecraft navigators use something called heteroclinic orbits \u2013 often called\nheteroclinic connections \u2013 which are paths that allow a spacecraft to travel\nfrom one orbit to another using the most efficient amount of fuel, or\nsometimes no fuel at all. But this usually takes a large amount of computer\npower or a lot of time to figure out.\n\nBut Owen and co-author Nicola Baresi, a lecturer in Orbital Mechanics at the\nUniversity of Surrey, wrote that by using knot theory, they have developed \"a\nmethod of robustly detecting heteroclinic connections,\" they wrote in their\npaper, to quickly generate rough trajectories \u2013 which can then be refined.\nThis gives spacecraft navigators a full list of all possible routes from a\ndesignated orbit, and the one that best fits the mission can be chosen. They\ncan then choose the one that best suits their mission.\n\nThe researchers tested their technique on various planetary systems, including\nthe Moon, and the Galilean moons of Jupiter.\n\n\"Spurred on by NASA's Artemis program, the new Moon race is inspiring mission\ndesigners around the world to research fuel-efficient routes that can better\nand more efficiently explore the vicinity of the Moon,\" said Baresi.\n\n\"Not only does our technique make that cumbersome task more straightforward,\nbut it can also be applied to other planetary systems, such as the icy moons\nof Saturn and Jupiter.\"\n\nThis article was originally published by Universe Today.
