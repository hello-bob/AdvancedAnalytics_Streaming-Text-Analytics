It\u2019s not the\nmost desirable setup for families, but Massachusetts has seen its shelter\nsystem overwhelmed amid a flood of thousands of migrants from Haiti and other\ncountries, and has begun using converted motel sites across the state to\naddress the crisis.\n\nStarting this month, however, the kids in Foxborough found something new to\nplay with in the parking lot (and some of them did): a dozen shiny, white and\nred, rectangular consoles, each about the size of a refrigerator, installed by\nautomaker Tesla as a new station for charging electric cars, which can cost\nanywhere from $40,000 to more than $100,000.\n\nGet Innovation Beat\n\nBoston Globe tech reporters tell the story of the region's technology and\ninnovation industry, highlighting key players, trends, and why they matter.\n\nThe strange scene reflects the state\u2019s efforts to address two of its biggest\nchallenges: finding beds for an influx of migrants that have overwhelmed the\nstate\u2019s shelter system and meeting its climate goals, which requires\ninstalling enough EV charging stations to convince drivers to switch to\nelectric cars.\n\nMore broadly, the scene underscores the difficult debate around how to support\nmigrants and the homeless in a state that is one of the wealthiest in the\nnation, with high incomes, expensive homes, and plenty of Tesla owners. The\nstate will spend over $900 million on emergency shelters for homeless families\nthis fiscal year.\n\n#### Related\n\nTesla opens first two charging stations in Mass. that work for all\nEVsMassachusetts unveils plan to improve EV charging. Critics say it\u2019s not\nmoving fast enough.Everything you need to know about the influx of migrants to\nMass.\n\nOn a bright spring afternoon, a few kids were kicking a soccer ball in the\ndriveway leading to the charging station when a Globe reporter visited. Two\nyoung girls, about kindergarten age, sat at the picnic tables and walked over\nto one of the Tesla consoles. They yanked on the thick black charging cable,\nand even used the crook of the console as a seat. After a few seconds, an\nadult called out and the girls ran off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a place where children play,\u201d one mother who lives at the site said.\nCars heading to the charging station must enter through the driveway where\nkids often kick or dribble a ball around. She pointed out a lack of any\nsignage warning drivers to slow down or be careful of children playing: \u201cYou\u2019d\nthink that would be one of the first things they\u2019d put up.\u201d\n\nOn a separate visit, about 20 elementary-school kids living at the shelter\nhung out in the parking lot on a weekday morning waiting for a Foxborough\npublic school bus pickup and would return in the afternoon after school got\nout.\n\nMeanwhile, a trickle of electric cars, some quite expensive, came through the\nlot. A Tesla Model S, seen charging one day, can cost as much as $90,000. The\nchargers have adapters for non-Teslas as well, and a Ford F-150 Lightning,\nwhich can cost more than $80,000, was juicing up on another occasion.\n\nTwo people who live at the shelter said children playing with the Tesla\nchargers is a common occurrence and they feared someone might get\nelectrocuted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid of what could happen to one of these kids,\u201d said a man who\ndeclined to give his name because he said he was ashamed of being homeless and\nliving at the shelter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of Tesla's newest EV charging stations is in the parking lot of a former\nComfort Inn in Foxborough currently being used to house migrants and people\nwho are homeless.Aaron Pressman/Globe Staff\n\nOn another visit, shelter residents had placed orange traffic cones in front\nof the two parking spaces for charging nearest the picnic tables, to keep cars\naway from the kids\u2019 play area. At the beginning of the construction process\nover the past six months, the charging site was fenced off, but that fencing\nwas removed once all the equipment was installed, people living at the shelter\nsaid. Many have been there since September, when the shelter opened.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment about the placement of the\nstation.\n\nElectrical safety experts said the situation was not ideal but not unsafe.\nTesla\u2019s charging stations separate the electrical transformers connected\ndirectly to the power grid from the charging consoles, they said. The\ntransformers connect to control and switching equipment inside locked cabinets\nat the back of the site. Electricity only flows from the cabinets through a\nconsole\u2019s charging cable when a driver connects their EV and activates a\ncharging session.\n\n\u201cThe good thing with these new technologies coming online, like EV chargers,\nis that there has been a long set of standards ... and lots of safety\nmechanisms built in,\u201d said Brett Brenner, president of the nonprofit\nElectrical Safety Foundation International, based in Virginia. \u201cAs long as\nit\u2019s designed safely, installed correctly, and maintained and operated\ncorrectly, there should be no risk to the public.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs part of the transition to electric vehicles, companies are building new\ncharging stations at a rapid clip. Tesla, the largest EV charger operator in\nthe state, opened new stations in Lynnfield and Provincetown at the same time\nas the station in Foxborough and has another site opening soon in Dedham. The\nsites use Tesla\u2019s new technology that can charge almost all kinds of EVs, not\njust Tesla vehicles.\n\nBut the company never intended to install a charging station next to a\nshelter, according to the Foxborough town manager and the site\u2019s owner.\n\nThe process of selecting sites for EV charging stations and applying for\nbuilding permits and utility connections takes months even before construction\nbegins. Tesla\u2019s contractor was awarded a building permit for the Foxborough\nsite on July 2, 2023, according to a copy of the permit. The town did not\nlearn about the state\u2019s plan to use the Comfort Inn as a shelter until August,\ntown manager Paige Duncan said.\n\n\u201cThe hotel initiated the installation of chargers on the corporate level well\nbefore any migrants or homeless individuals were accommodated,\u201d Duncan wrote\nin an email to the Globe. \u201cRegarding the proximity of chargers to areas\nfrequented by children, this decision was made at the corporate level by\nexternal parties (the State for placement at the hotel \u2014 the town was not\nconsulted) and the hotel\u2019s corporate management for charger placement.\u201d\n\nThe station was installed in accordance with all electrical code regulations,\nDuncan added. \u201cIt\u2019s understood that parents should supervise their children\u2019s\nactivities outdoors,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement, Giri Hotels, which owns the site, said the chargers were\nlocated \u201cacross the parking lot and at a safe distance 65 feet away from the\nbuilding.\u201d Giri approved the installation \u201cbefore the housing of migrant\nresidents, in an effort to accommodate electric vehicles.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities, responsible\nfor housing the migrants, said it had not received complaints from residents\nabout the chargers in Foxborough. \u201cThe safety of residents in Emergency\nAssistance shelter is a priority and staff work to address concerns when they\nare brought to our attention,\u201d the agency said in an emailed statement.\n\nSo far, the charging station has not been very busy. Since opening this month,\nit has only been lightly used by EV drivers needing a charge, according to a\nusage graph in Tesla\u2019s mobile app. The new station in Lynnfield, located in a\nstrip mall \u2014 a more typical charging site \u2014 has been busier.\n\nAn electric vehicle charged up at a Foxborough Tesla charging station located\nin the parking lot of a hotel that has been converted for use as housing for\nmigrants and homeless people.Jonathan Wiggs/Globe Staff\n\nThe Foxborough setting didn\u2019t bother one Tesla Model 3 driver using the\nstation last week. \u201cI like it, I think [the location is] fine,\u201d said Von, the\ndriver who gave only his first name to protect his privacy. \u201cWe need more\nchargers.\u201d (He said he gets free charging from Tesla and goes to the station\nregularly.)\n\nAnd while there doesn\u2019t appear to be any immediate danger to children,\nBrenner, from the safety foundation, said the site could pose a potential\nthreat in the future.\n\n\u201cHumans are very ingenious about finding ways to get themselves hurt,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cLet\u2019s say five years from now, if those chargers are not maintained and\npeople get into things they\u2019re not supposed to, that\u2019s Pandora\u2019s box.\u201d\n\nAaron Pressman can be reached at aaron.pressman@globe.com.
