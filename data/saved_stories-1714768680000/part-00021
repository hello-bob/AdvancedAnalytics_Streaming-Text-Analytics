The\nexplosive proliferation of botshit has supercharged the sleazy \"search engine\noptimization\" business, such that results to common queries are 50% Google ads\nto spam sites, and 50% links to spam sites that tricked Google into a high\nrank (without paying for an ad):\n\nhttps://developers.google.com/search/blog/2024/03/core-update-spam-\npolicies#site-reputation\n\nIt's nice that Google has finally stopped gaslighting the rest of us with\nclaims that its search was still the same bedrock utility that so many of us\nrelied upon as a key piece of internet infrastructure. This not only feels\nwildly wrong, it is empirically, provably false:\n\nhttps://downloads.webis.de/publications/papers/bevendorff_2024a.pdf\n\nNot only that, but we know why Google search sucks. Memos released as part of\nthe DOJ's antitrust case against Google reveal that the company deliberately\nchose to worsen search quality to increase the number of queries you'd have to\nmake (and the number of ads you'd have to see) to find a decent result:\n\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2024/04/24/naming-names/#prabhakar-raghavan\n\nGoogle's antitrust case turns on the idea that the company bought its way to\ndominance, spending the some of the billions it extracted from advertisers and\npublishers to buy the default position on every platform, so that no one ever\ntried another search engine, which meant that no one would invest in another\nsearch engine, either.\n\nGoogle's tacit defense is that its monopoly billions only incidentally fund\nthese kind of anticompetitive deals. Mostly, Google says, it uses its billions\nto build the greatest search engine, ad platform, mobile OS, etc that the\npublic could dream of. Only a company as big as Google (says Google) can\nafford to fund the R&D and security to keep its platform useful for the rest\nof us.\n\nThat's the \"monopolistic bargain\" \u2013 let the monopolist become a dictator, and\nthey will be a benevolent dictator. Shriven of \"wasteful competition,\" the\nmonopolist can split their profits with the public by funding public goods and\nthe public interest.\n\nGoogle has clearly reneged on that bargain. A company experiencing the\ndramatic security failures and declining quality should be pouring everything\nit has to righting the ship. Instead, Google repeatedly blew tens of billions\nof dollars on stock buybacks while doing mass layoffs:\n\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2024/02/21/im-feeling-unlucky/#not-up-to-the-task\n\nThose layoffs have now reached the company's \"core\" teams, even as its core\nservices continue to decay:\n\nhttps://qz.com/google-is-laying-off-hundreds-as-it-moves-core-jobs-\nabr-1851449528\n\n(Google's antitrust trial was shrouded in secrecy, thanks to the judge's\ndeference to the company's insistence on confidentiality. The case is moving\nalong though, and warrants your continued attention:)\n\nhttps://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/the-2-trillion-secret-trial-against\n\nGoogle wormed its way into so many corners of our lives that its\nenshittification keeps erupting in odd places, like ordering takeout food:\n\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2023/02/24/passive-income/#swiss-cheese-security\n\nBack in February, Housefresh \u2013 a rigorous review site for home air purifiers \u2013\npublished a viral, damning account of how Google had allowed itself to be\noverrun by spammers who purport to provide reviews of air purifiers, but who\ndo little to no testing and often employ AI chatbots to write automated\ngarbage:\n\nhttps://housefresh.com/david-vs-digital-goliaths/\n\nIn the months since, Housefresh's Gisele Navarro has continued to fight for\nthe survival of her high-quality air purifier review site, and has received\nmany tips from insiders at the spam-farms and Google, all of which she\nrecounts in a followup essay:\n\nhttps://housefresh.com/how-google-decimated-housefresh/\n\nOne of the worst offenders in spam wars is Dotdash Meredith, a content-farm\nthat \"publishes\" multiple websites that recycle parts of each others' content\nin order to climb to the top search slots for lucrative product review spots,\nwhich can be monetized via affiliate links.\n\nA Dotdash Meredith insider told Navarro that the company uses a tactic called\n\"keyword swarming\" to push high-quality independent sites off the top of\nGoogle and replace them with its own garbage reviews. When Dotdash Meredith\nfinds an independent site that occupies the top results for a lucrative Google\nresult, they \"swarm a smaller site\u2019s foothold on one or two articles by\nessentially publishing 10 articles [on the topic] and beefing up [Dotdash\nMeredith sites\u2019] authority.\"\n\nDotdash Meredith has keyword swarmed a large number of topics. from air\npurifiers to slow cookers to posture correctors for back-pain:\n\nhttps://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/keyword-swarming-dotdash.jpg\n\nThe company isn't shy about this. Its own shareholder communications boast\nabout it. What's more, it has competition.\n\nTake Forbes, an actual news-site, which has a whole shadow-empire of web-pages\nreviewing products for puppies, dogs, kittens and cats, all of which link to\nhigh affiliate-fee-generating pet insurance products. These reviews are not\ngood, but they are treasured by Google's algorithm, which views them as a part\nof Forbes's legitimate news-publishing operation and lets them draft on\nForbes's authority.\n\nThis side-hustle for Forbes comes at a cost for the rest of us, though. The\nreviewers who actually put in the hard work to figure out which pet products\nare worth your money (and which ones are bad, defective or dangerous) are\ncrowded off the front page of Google and eventually disappear, leaving behind\nnothing but semi-automated SEO garbage from Forbes:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ichbinGisele/status/1642481590524583936\n\nThere's a name for this: \"site reputation abuse.\" That's when a site perverts\nits current \u2013 or past \u2013 practice of publishing high-quality materials to trick\nGoogle into giving the site a high ranking. Think of how Deadspin's private\nequity grifter owners turned it into a site full of casino affiliate spam:\n\nhttps://www.404media.co/who-owns-deadspin-now-lineup-publishing/\n\nThe same thing happened to the venerable Money magazine:\n\nhttps://moneygroup.pr/\n\nMoney is one of the many sites whose air purifier reviews Google gives\npreference to, despite the fact that they do no testing. According to Google,\nMoney is also a reliable source of information on reprogramming your garage-\ndoor opener, buying a paint-sprayer, etc:\n\nhttps://money.com/best-paint-sprayer/\n\nAll of this is made ten million times worse by AI, which can spray out\nsuperficially plausible botshit in superhuman quantities, letting spammers\nproduce thousands of variations on their shitty reviews, flooding the zone\nwith bullshit in classic Steve Bannon style:\n\nhttps://escapecollective.com/commerce-content-is-breaking-product-reviews/\n\nAs Gizmodo, Sports Illustrated and USA Today have learned the hard way, AI\ncan't write factual news pieces. But it can pump out bullshit written for the\nexpress purpose of drafting on the good work human journalists have done and\ntricking Google \u2013 the search engine 90% of us rely on \u2013 into upranking\nbullshit at the expense of high-quality information.\n\nA variety of AI service bureaux have popped up to provide AI botshit as a\nservice to news brands. While Navarro doesn't say so, I'm willing to bet that\nfor news bosses, outsourcing your botshit scams to a third party is considered\nan excellent way of avoiding your journalists' wrath. The biggest botshit-as-\na-service company is ASR Group (which also uses the alias Advon Commerce).\n\nAdvon claims that its botshit is, in fact, written by humans. But Advon's\nemployees' Linkedin profiles tell a different story, boasting of their mastery\nof AI tools in the industrial-scale production of botshit:\n\nhttps://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Advon-AI-LinkedIn.jpg\n\nNow, none of this is particularly sophisticated. It doesn't take much\ndiscernment to spot when a site is engaged in \"site reputation abuse.\"\nPresumably, the 12,000 googlers the company fired last year could have been\nemployed to check the top review keyword results manually every couple of days\nand permaban any site caught cheating this way.\n\nInstead, Google is has announced a change in policy: starting May 5, the\ncompany will downrank any site caught engaged in site reputation abuse.\nHowever, the company takes a very narrow view of site reputation abuse,\nlimiting punishments to sites that employ third parties to generate or uprank\ntheir botshit. Companies that produce their botshit in-house are seemingly not\ncovered by this policy.\n\nAs Navarro writes, some sites \u2013 like Forbes \u2013 have prepared for May 5 by\nblocking their botshit sections from Google's crawler. This can't be their\npermanent strategy, though \u2013 either they'll have to kill the section or bring\nit in-house to comply with Google's rules. Bringing things in house isn't that\nhard: US News and World Report is advertising for an SEO editor who will\npublish 70-80 posts per month, doubtless each one a masterpiece of high-\nquality, carefully researched material of great value to Google's users:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/dannyashton/status/1777408051357585425\n\nAs Navarro points out, Google is palpably reluctant to target the largest,\nbest-funded spammers. Its March 2024 update kicked many garbage AI sites out\nof the index \u2013 but only small bottom-feeders, not large, once-respected\npublications that have been colonized by private equity spam-farmers.\n\nAll of this comes at a price, and it's only incidentally paid by legitimate\nsites like Housefresh. The real price is borne by all of us, who are funneled\nby the 90%-market-share search engine into \"review\" sites that push low\nquality, high-price products. Housefresh's top budget air purifier costs $79.\nThat's hundreds of dollars cheaper than the \"budget\" pick at other sites, who\nlargely perform no original research.\n\nGoogle search has a problem. AI botshit is dominating Google's search results,\nand it's not just in product reviews. Searches for infrastructure code samples\nare dominated by botshit code generated by Pulumi AI, whose chatbot\nhallucinates nonexistence AWS features:\n\nhttps://www.theregister.com/2024/05/01/pulumi_ai_pollution_of_search/\n\nThis is hugely consequential: when these \"hallucinations\" slip through into\nproduction code, they create huge vulnerabilities for widespread malicious\nexploitation:\n\nhttps://www.theregister.com/2024/03/28/ai_bots_hallucinate_software_packages/\n\nWe've put all our eggs in Google's basket, and Google's dropped the basket \u2013\nbut it doesn't matter because they can spend $20b/year bribing Apple to make\nsure no one ever tries a rival search engine on Ios or Safari:\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-payments-apple-reached-20-220947331.html\n\nGoogle's response \u2013 laying off core developers, outsourcing to low-waged\nterritories with weak labor protections and spending billions on stock\nbuybacks \u2013 presents a picture of a company that is too big to care:\n\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2024/04/04/teach-me-how-to-shruggie/#kagi\n\nGoogle promised us a quid-pro-quo: let them be the single, authoritative\nportal (\"organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible\nand useful\"), and they will earn that spot by being the best search there is:\n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/b9eb3180-2a6e-41eb-91fe-2ab5942d4150\n\nBut \u2013 like the spammers at the top of its search result pages \u2013 Google didn't\nearn its spot at the center of our digital lives.\n\nIt cheated.\n\n(Image: freezelight, CC BY-SA 2.0, modified)\n\n# Hey look at this (permalink)\n\n  * Reject Definitions of Antisemitism that Encompass Protected Speech https://www.aclu.org/documents/reject-definitions-of-anti-semitism-that-encompass-protected-speech (h/t Naked Capitalism)\n\n  * Message to Congress on Curbing Monopolies https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/message-congress-curbing-monopolies (h/t Naked Capitalism)\n\n  * The Age of Cloud Capital https://www.persuasion.community/p/the-age-of-cloud-capital\n\n# This day in history (permalink)\n\n#20yrsago Senator Franken?
