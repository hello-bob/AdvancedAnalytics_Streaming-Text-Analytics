In particular, this means if you're using unary, you cannot store a unary representation of the current number in memory.\n  * Unlike our usual rules, feel free to use a language (or language version) even if it's newer than this challenge. Languages specifically written to submit a 0-byte answer to this challenge are fair game but not particularly interesting.\n\nNote that there must be an interpreter so the submission can be tested. It is\nallowed (and even encouraged) to write this interpreter yourself for a\npreviously unimplemented language.\n\n  * This is not about finding the language with the shortest solution for this (there are some where the empty program does the trick) - this is about finding the shortest solution in every language. Therefore, no answer will be marked as accepted.\n\n### Catalogue\n\nThe Stack Snippet at the bottom of this post generates the catalogue from the\nanswers a) as a list of shortest solution per language and b) as an overall\nleaderboard.\n\nTo make sure that your answer shows up, please start your answer with a\nheadline, using the following Markdown template:\n\n    \n    \n    ## Language Name, N bytes\n\nwhere N is the size of your submission. If you improve your score, you can\nkeep old scores in the headline, by striking them through. For instance:\n\n    \n    \n    ## Ruby, <s>104</s> <s>101</s> 96 bytes\n\nIf there you want to include multiple numbers in your header (e.g. because\nyour score is the sum of two files or you want to list interpreter flag\npenalties separately), make sure that the actual score is the last number in\nthe header:\n\n    \n    \n    ## Perl, 43 + 2 (-p flag) = 45 bytes\n\nYou can also make the language name a link which will then show up in the\nsnippet:\n\n    \n    \n    ## [><>](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Fish), 121 bytes\n\nShow code snippet\n\n    \n    \n    <style>body { text-align: left !important} #answer-list { padding: 10px;
