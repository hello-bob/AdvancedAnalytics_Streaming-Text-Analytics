For supporting styling and LXQt File Dialog with Qt5-based apps, libqtxdg-3.12.0, lxqt-qtplugin-1.4.1 and libfm-qt-1.4.0 can be installed alongside their Qt6-based versions in LXQt 2.0.0.\n  * PCManFM-Qt\u2019s desktop module, LXQt Runner and LXQt Desktop Notifications are completely ready to be used under Wayland compositors which support the \u201clayer shell protocol\u201d, like LabWC, Wayfire, kwin_wayland, Hyprland, Sway,...\n  * Wayland will be the main target for LXQt 2.1.0, as Qt6 was for LXQt 2.0.0. The components which are not ready for Wayland yet include ScreenGrab, LXQt Global Shortcuts, LXQt Panel\u2019s task-bar and keyboard indicator (but LXQt Panel can be used under Wayland without those plugins), some input settings, and settings of monitor, power button, and screen locker. However, most Wayland compositors have tools that can be used instead of them, such that an LXQt-Wayland session is already possible for advanced users.\n  * LXQt Panel has a new default application menu called Fancy Menu, featuring \u201cFavorites\u201d, \u201cAll Applications\u201d, and an improved search.\n  * QTerminal is the only app whose Qt6 port will be released separately \u2013 complications were encountered due to the removal of legacy encodings from Qt6. Until then, its Qt5 version 1.4.0 could be used.\n\nNOTE for Distros: For having Qt5 styling and Qt5 file dialog with LXQt 2.0.0,\nthe installable packages of Qt5-based lxqt-build-tools, libqtxdg, lxqt-\nqtplugin and libfm-qt may need to be renamed, such that they can be installed\nin parallel with their Qt6 versions. Also, the point release of the Qt5-based\nlxqt-qtplugin-1.4.1 is needed for a correct Qt5 font setting (see its release\nnote).\n\n### LibFM-Qt / PCManFM-Qt\n\n  * The desktop module is completely ready for Wayland, thanks to layer-shell-qt6. Now, PCManFM-Qt can give you a real desktop not only with desktop-agnostic X11 windows managers, but also with Wayland compositors which implement \u201clayer shell protocol\u201d, like those based on wlroots or KWin. Also, see Using Desktop under Wayland in Wiki.\n  * The MIME types of LXQt Archiver and Arqiver are updated in LibFM-Qt.\n  * Some menu icons are added.\n\n### LXQt Panel\n\n  * Fancy Menu is added as the new default application menu. (The old menu is kept, but it is not the default menu anymore.)\n  * Wayland support is added for positioning the panel by using layer shell.\n  * Miscellaneous fixes.\n\n### LXQt Runner\n\n  * Full Wayland support is added.\n\n### LXQt Desktop Notifications\n\n  * Full Wayland support is added.\n\n## Release Notes\n\nPlease see the release page of each LXQt component for its release note.\n\n# Links\n\nDiscussions\n\n    \n\ngithub.com/lxqt/lxqt/discussions\n\nBug Tracker\n\n    \n\ngithub.com/lxqt/lxqt/issues\n\nWiki\n\n    \n\ngithub.com/lxqt/lxqt\n\nInstant messaging\n\n    \n\n  * Matrix: #lxqt:matrix.org\n  * Telegram: LXQt Project\n  * IRC: #lxqt on OFTC (bridged among them)\n\n  * #lxqt-dev on OFTC\n\nMastodon\n\n    \n\n@LXQt@mastodon.social\n\nTwitter\n\n    \n\nTwitter/lxqt-project\n\nFeed RSS\n\n    \n\nlxqt-project.org/feed.xml\n\n# Downloads\n\n  * GitHub\n\n  * ALT Linux\n\n  * Arch Linux\n\n  * Artix\n\n  * Debian\n\n  * Devuan\n\n  * Endeavouros\n\n  * Fedora\n\n  * FreeBSD\n\n  * Garuda\n\n  * Gentoo\n\n  * NetBSD\n\n  * Mageia\n\n  * Manjaro\n\n  * OpenMandriva\n\n  * ROSA Linux\n\n  * openSUSE\n\n  * Ubuntu\n\n  * Void\n\n# Legal\n\nLXQt is licensed under GNU GPL 2.0+ and GNU LGPL 2.1+. lxqt-project.org is\nlicensed under CC BY-SA 3.0.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
