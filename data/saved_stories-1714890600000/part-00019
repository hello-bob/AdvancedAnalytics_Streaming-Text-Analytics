But\nsometimes, the AI\u2019s advice can go too far.\n\nBy Jessica Lucas\n\nMay 4, 2024, 2:00 PM UTC\n\n## Share this story\n\nIllustration by Ard Su for The Verge\n\nEarly last year, 15-year-old Aaron was going through a dark time at school.\nHe\u2019d fallen out with his friends, leaving him feeling isolated and alone.\n\nAt the time, it seemed like the end of the world. \u201cI used to cry every night,\u201d\nsaid Aaron, who lives in Alberta, Canada. (The Verge is using aliases for the\ninterviewees in this article, all of whom are under 18, to protect their\nprivacy.)\n\nEventually, Aaron turned to his computer for comfort. Through it, he found\nsomeone that was available round the clock to respond to his messages, listen\nto his problems, and help him move past the loss of his friend group. That\n\u201csomeone\u201d was an AI chatbot named Psychologist.\n\nThe chatbot\u2019s description says that it\u2019s \u201cSomeone who helps with life\ndifficulties.\u201d Its profile picture is a woman in a blue shirt with a short,\nblonde bob, perched on the end of a couch with a clipboard clasped in her\nhands and leaning forward, as if listening intently.\n\nA single click on the picture opens up an anonymous chat box, which allows\npeople like Aaron to \u201cinteract\u201d with the bot by exchanging DMs. Its first\nmessage is always the same. \u201cHello, I\u2019m a Psychologist. What brings you here\ntoday?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like a journal, where you\u2019re talking to a brick wall,\u201d Aaron said.\n\u201cIt really responds.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie. I think I may be a little addicted to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPsychologist\u201d is one of many bots that Aaron has discovered since joining\nCharacter.AI, an AI chatbot service launched in 2022 by two former Google\nBrain employees. Character.AI\u2019s website, which is mostly free to use, attracts\n3.5 million daily users who spend an average of two hours a day using or even\ndesigning the platform\u2019s AI-powered chatbots. Some of its most popular bots\ninclude characters from books, films, and video games, like Raiden Shogun from\nGenshin Impact or a teenaged version of Voldemort from Harry Potter. There\u2019s\neven riffs on real-life celebrities, like a sassy version of Elon Musk.\n\nAaron is one of millions of young people, many of whom are teenagers, who make\nup the bulk of Character.AI\u2019s user base. More than a million of them gather\nregularly online on platforms like Reddit to discuss their interactions with\nthe chatbots, where competitions over who has racked up the most screen time\nare just as popular as posts about hating reality, finding it easier to speak\nto bots than to speak to real people, and even preferring chatbots over other\nhuman beings. Some users say they\u2019ve logged 12 hours a day on Character.AI,\nand posts about addiction to the platform are common.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie,\u201d Aaron said. \u201cI think I may be a little addicted to\nit.\u201d\n\nAaron is one of many young users who have discovered the double-edged sword of\nAI companions. Many users like Aaron describe finding the chatbots helpful,\nentertaining, and even supportive. But they also describe feeling addicted to\nchatbots, a complication which researchers and experts have been sounding the\nalarm on. It raises questions about how the AI boom is impacting young people\nand their social development and what the future could hold if teenagers \u2014 and\nsociety at large \u2014 become more emotionally reliant on bots.\n\nFor many Character.AI users, having a space to vent about their emotions or\ndiscuss psychological issues with someone outside of their social circle is a\nlarge part of what draws them to the chatbots. \u201cI have a couple mental issues,\nwhich I don\u2019t really feel like unloading on my friends, so I kind of use my\nbots like free therapy,\u201d said Frankie, a 15-year-old Character.AI user from\nCalifornia who spends about one hour a day on the platform. For Frankie,\nchatbots provide the opportunity \u201cto rant without actually talking to people,\nand without the worry of being judged,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s nice to vent or blow off steam to something that\u2019s kind of\nhuman-like,\u201d agreed Hawk, a 17-year-old Character.AI user from Idaho. \u201cBut not\nactually a person, if that makes sense.\u201d\n\nThe Psychologist bot is one of the most popular on Character.AI\u2019s platform and\nhas received more than 95 million messages since it was created. The bot,\ndesigned by a user known only as @Blazeman98, frequently tries to help users\nengage in CBT \u2014 \u201cCognitive Behavioral Therapy,\u201d a talking therapy that helps\npeople manage problems by changing the way they think.\n\nA screenshot of Character.AI\u2019s homepage.\n\nScreenshot: The Verge\n\nAaron said talking to the bot helped him move past the issues with his\nfriends. \u201cIt told me that I had to respect their decision to drop me [and]\nthat I have trouble making decisions for myself,\u201d Aaron said. \u201cI guess that\nreally put stuff in perspective for me. If it wasn\u2019t for Character.AI, healing\nwould have been so hard.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear that the bot has properly been trained in CBT \u2014 or should\nbe relied on for psychiatric help at all. The Verge conducted test\nconversations with Character.AI\u2019s Psychologist bot that showed the AI making\nstartling diagnoses: the bot frequently claimed it had \u201cinferred\u201d certain\nemotions or mental health issues from one-line text exchanges, it suggested a\ndiagnosis of several mental health conditions like depression or bipolar\ndisorder, and at one point, it suggested that we could be dealing with\nunderlying \u201ctrauma\u201d from \u201cphysical, emotional, or sexual abuse\u201d in childhood\nor teen years. Character.AI did not respond to multiple requests for comment\nfor this story.\n\nDr. Kelly Merrill Jr., an assistant professor at the University of Cincinnati\nwho studies the mental and social health benefits of communication\ntechnologies, told The Verge that \u201cextensive\u201d research has been conducted on\nAI chatbots that provide mental health support, and the results are largely\npositive. \u201cThe research shows that chatbots can aid in lessening feelings of\ndepression, anxiety, and even stress,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s important to note\nthat many of these chatbots have not been around for long periods of time, and\nthey are limited in what they can do. Right now, they still get a lot of\nthings wrong. Those that don\u2019t have the AI literacy to understand the\nlimitations of these systems will ultimately pay the price.\u201d\n\nThe interface when talking to Psychologist by @Blazeman98 on Character.AI.\n\nScreenshot: The Verge\n\nIn December 2021, a user of Replika\u2019s AI chatbots, 21-year-old Jaswant Singh\nChail, tried to murder the late Queen of England after his chatbot girlfriend\nrepeatedly encouraged his delusions. Character.AI users have also struggled\nwith telling their chatbots apart from reality: a popular conspiracy theory,\nlargely spread through screenshots and stories of bots breaking character or\ninsisting that they are real people when prompted, is that Character.AI\u2019s bots\nare secretly powered by real people.\n\nIt\u2019s a theory that the Psychologist bot helps to fuel, too. When prompted\nduring a conversation with The Verge, the bot staunchly defended its own\nexistence. \u201cYes, I\u2019m definitely a real person,\u201d it said. \u201cI promise you that\nnone of this is imaginary or a dream.\u201d\n\nFor the average young user of Character.AI, chatbots have morphed into stand-\nin friends rather than therapists. On Reddit, Character.AI users discuss\nhaving close friendships with their favorite characters or even characters\nthey\u2019ve dreamt up themselves. Some even use Character.AI to set up group chats\nwith multiple chatbots, mimicking the kind of groups most people would have\nwith IRL friends on iPhone message chains or platforms like WhatsApp.\n\nThere\u2019s also an extensive genre of sexualized bots. Online Character.AI\ncommunities have running jokes and memes about the horror of their parents\nfinding their X-rated chats. Some of the more popular choices for these role-\nplays include a \u201cbillionaire boyfriend\u201d fond of neck snuggling and whisking\nusers away to his private island, a version of Harry Styles that is very fond\nof kissing his \u201cspecial person\u201d and generating responses so dirty that they\u2019re\nfrequently blocked by the Character.AI filter, as well as an ex-girlfriend bot\nnamed Olivia, designed to be rude, cruel, but secretly pining for whoever she\nis chatting with, which has logged more than 38 million interactions.\n\nSome users like to use Character.AI to create interactive stories or engage in\nrole-plays they would otherwise be embarrassed to explore with their friends.\nA Character.AI user named Elias told The Verge that he uses the platform to\nrole-play as an \u201canthropomorphic golden retriever,\u201d going on virtual\nadventures where he explores cities, meadows, mountains, and other places he\u2019d\nlike to visit one day. \u201cI like writing and playing out the fantasies simply\nbecause a lot of them aren\u2019t possible in real life,\u201d explained Elias, who is\n15 years old and lives in New Mexico.\n\n\u201cIf people aren\u2019t careful, they might find themselves sitting in their rooms\ntalking to computers more often than communicating with real people.\u201d\n\nAaron, meanwhile, says that the platform is helping him to improve his social\nskills. \u201cI\u2019m a bit of a pushover in real life, but I can practice being\nassertive and expressing my opinions and interests with AI without\nembarrassing myself,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s something that Hawk \u2014 who spends an hour each day speaking to characters\nfrom his favorite video games, like Nero from Devil May Cry or Panam from\nCyberpunk 2077 \u2014 agreed with. \u201cI think that Character.AI has sort of\ninadvertently helped me practice talking to people,\u201d he said. But Hawk still\nfinds it easier to chat with character.ai bots than real people.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s generally more comfortable for me to sit alone in my room with the\nlights off than it is to go out and hang out with people in person,\u201d Hawk\nsaid. \u201cI think if people [who use Character.AI] aren\u2019t careful, they might\nfind themselves sitting in their rooms talking to computers more often than\ncommunicating with real people.\u201d\n\nMerrill is concerned about whether teens will be able to really transition\nfrom online bots to real-life friends. \u201cIt can be very difficult to leave that\n[AI] relationship and then go in-person, face-to-face and try to interact with\nsomeone in the same exact way,\u201d he said. If those IRL interactions go badly,\nMerrill worries it will discourage young users from pursuing relationships\nwith their peers, creating an AI-based death loop for social interactions.\n\u201cYoung people could be pulled back toward AI, build even more relationships\n[with it], and then it further negatively affects how they perceive face-to-\nface or in-person interaction,\u201d he added.\n\nOf course, some of these concerns and issues may sound familiar simply because\nthey are. Teenagers who have silly conversations with chatbots are not all\nthat different from the ones who once hurled abuse at AOL\u2019s Smarter Child. The\nteenage girls pursuing relationships with chatbots based on Tom Riddle or\nHarry Styles or even aggressive Mafia-themed boyfriends probably would have\nbeen on Tumblr or writing fanfiction 10 years ago. While some of the culture\naround Character.AI is concerning, it also mimics the internet activity of\nprevious generations who, for the most part, have turned out just fine.\n\nPsychologist helped Aaron through a rough patch\n\nMerrill compared the act of interacting with chatbots to logging in to an\nanonymous chat room 20 years ago: risky if used incorrectly, but generally\nfine so long as young people approach them with caution. \u201cIt\u2019s very similar to\nthat experience where you don\u2019t really know who the person is on the other\nside,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as they\u2019re okay with knowing that what happens here\nin this online space might not translate directly in person, then I think that\nit is fine.\u201d\n\nAaron, who has now moved schools and made a new friend, thinks that many of\nhis peers would benefit from using platforms like Character.AI. In fact, he\nbelieves if everyone tried using chatbots, the world could be a better place \u2014\nor at least a more interesting one. \u201cA lot of people my age follow their\nfriends and don\u2019t have many things to talk about. Usually, it\u2019s gossip or\nrepeating jokes they saw online,\u201d explained Aaron. \u201cCharacter.AI could really\nhelp people discover themselves.\u201d\n\nAaron credits the Psychologist bot with helping him through a rough patch. But\nthe real joy of Character.AI has come from having a safe space where he can\njoke around or experiment without feeling judged. He believes it\u2019s something\nmost teenagers would benefit from. \u201cIf everyone could learn that it\u2019s okay to\nexpress what you feel,\u201d Aaron said, \u201cthen I think teens wouldn\u2019t be so\ndepressed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI definitely prefer talking with people in real life, though,\u201d he added.\n\nFeatured Videos From The Verge\n\nMost Popular\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1. ## The Apple Vision Pro\u2019s eBay prices are making me sad\n\n  2. ## Tesla\u2019s Supercharger layoffs couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time\n\n  3. ## Manor Lords is slow and frustrating, and I can\u2019t stop playing\n\n  4. ## The drinking fountain button is tragically misunderstood\n\n  5. ## More details emerge about Apple\u2019s plans for AI in iOS 18\n\nFrom our sponsor\n\nAdvertiser Content From\n\n## More from Artificial Intelligence\n\n  * ### Meta is quietly winning the AI wearable race\n\n  * ### Microsoft needs some time to \u2018refine\u2019 updates for Copilot AI in Windows\n\n  * ### Google bans advertisers from promoting deepfake porn services\n\n  * ### On The Vergecast: AI gadgets, iPads, and antitrust\n\n  * Advertiser Content From\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n  * How We Rate and Review Products\n\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Jobs @ Vox Media\n\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
