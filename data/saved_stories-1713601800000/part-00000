Such a state can be induced by\ncontrolling the spin-splitting field in Josephson junction devices, allowing\naccess to a wide range of the phase diagram. Here we demonstrate that a\nFulde\u2013Ferrell\u2013Larkin\u2013Ovchinnikov state can be induced in Josephson junctions\nbased on the two-dimensional dilute magnetic topological insulator (Hg,Mn)Te.\nWe do this by observing the dependence of the critical current on the magnetic\nfield and temperature. The substitution of Mn dopants induces an enhanced\nZeeman effect, which can be controlled with high precision by using a small\nexternal magnetic field. We observe multiple re-entrant behaviours of the\ncritical current as a response to an in-plane magnetic field, which we assign\nto transitions between ground states with a phase shifted by \u03c0. This will\nenable the study of the Fulde\u2013Ferrell\u2013Larkin\u2013Ovchinnikov state in much more\naccessible experimental conditions.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Unconventional supercurrent phase in Ising superconductor Josephson\njunction with atomically thin magnetic insulator\n\nArticle Open access 09 September 2021\n\nH.

Yong P. Chen\n\n## Main\n\nIn their pioneering papers, Fulde and Ferrell, and Larkin and Ovchinnikov,\npredicted the existence of an inhomogeneous state now carrying their names\n(FFLO) when a superconductor is exposed to a spin-exchange field^1,2. The FFLO\nstate is a consequence of the interplay between this exchange splitting (or,\nmore generally, any spin-splitting field such as a Zeeman field) in the\nconduction band and the singlet-state Cooper pairs of the superconductor: the\npairing state acquires a finite momentum proportional to E_Z/v_F, where E_Z is\nthe Zeeman energy and v_F is the Fermi velocity. This, in turn, leads to a\nspatially oscillating order parameter. The initial observation of an FFLO\nstate^3 in the superconductor \u03ba-(BEDT-TTF)_2Cu(NCS)_2 (BEDT-TTF=bis(ethylene-\ndithio)tetrathiafulvalene) was restricted to a small temperature and magnetic\nfield range. A recent flurry of activities has shown the same behaviour in\nvarious other systems^4,5,6,7 that are intrinsic bulk superconductors. A state\nanalogous to the FFLO state can occur in hybrid superconductor systems, where\nsuperconducting correlations in a non-superconducting material are induced by\nproximity in a spin-splitting field. The latter can be caused by an external\nfield via Zeeman coupling or in ferromagnetic metals (F)^8,9,10 with an\nintrinsic exchange field at the Fermi level. As in bulk superconductors, the\nspin-splitting field leads to pairs of electrons with a finite momentum, which\nmanifest as a spatially oscillating effective order parameter induced in the\nnon-superconducting material defined as \u03a8(r) = \u3008\u03c8_\u2191(r)\u03c8_\u2193(r)\u3009. Notably,\nwhereas the FFLO state in bulk systems is restricted to a narrow range of the\nphase diagram, the proximity-induced FFLO (pFFLO) state occurs at any field\nvalue, allowing for tunability of the device and potentially opening a path\ntowards applicability. While our experiment does not involve scanning probe\ntechniques and thus cannot directly measure the spatial modulation of \u03a8(r), we\nview our observation of a 0\u2013\u03c0 transition and re-entrance superconductivity as\na function of both the in-plane magnetic field and the temperature in the same\ndilute magnetic topological insulator-based weak link device as clear evidence\nof a pFFLO state.\n\nThe pFFLO state is responsible for, among other effects, the transition from a\nzero phase to a \u03c0 phase in superconductor\u2013normal\u2013superconductor Josephson\njunctions (JJs). This is actually a change in the ground state of the\njunction. It is detected as a re-entrant behaviour of the supercurrent. As a\nfunction of continuously varying a parameter, the observed critical current\nfirst decreases to zero and then increases again.\n\nHowever, the measurement of such re-entrant behaviour or a \u03c0 transition as a\nfunction of a single parameter is not sufficient to show a pFFLO state. One\nalso needs to confirm the spatial modulation of \u03a8(r), which is as shown in\nFig. 1c. As such, previous experiments have only hinted at pFFLO, for example,\nby observing the re-entrant behaviour as a function of the temperature,\nthickness or magnetic configuration of multilayers, in ferromagnetic weak link\njunctions^11,12,13,14,15,16, where no statement about spatial modulation in a\nsingle device can be made, or re-entrance as a function of the in-plane\nmagnetic field in semiconducting weak links^17,18,19,20, where it might\noriginate from simple Fraunhofer-like interference as the field penetrates the\ncross-section of the only quasi-two-dimensional weak link.\n\nFig. 1: The device layout and a schematic of the spatial modulation of\nRe(\u03a8(r)).\n\na, A schematic of a side-contacted JJ with the quantum well indicated in red.\nThe magnetic field directions are indicated in the left corner. b, A Nomarski\nmicroscopy image of one such investigated JJ. c, A schematic of Re(\u03a8(r)) with\nan increase in the Zeeman energy, for zero field, a 0 junction and a \u03c0\njunction. Darker blue tones indicate more positive values, and darker red more\nnegative, and white marks the zero crossings. The slight curvature in the\nfunction in the zero-field case results from the finite decay length for the\nproximity effect.\n\nFull size image\n\nAs such, an unambiguous identification of pFFLO behaviour requires a highly\ntunable device where the re-entrant behaviour can be driven by multiple\nparameters. In ferromagnetic weak links^9,11,12,13,14, this is not possible as\nthere is no way to substantially tune the strength of the magnetic exchange\nfield within a given device. In non-magnetic semiconducting devices, the\nZeeman energy can be tuned by the application of a magnetic field, but the\neffect is sufficiently weak that the fields that would be needed to reveal\npFFLO are so large that they destroy the induced supercurrent. In this\nArticle, we use a dilute magnetic semiconductor weak link to explore the\ntemperature and magnetic field dependence of the pFFLO state.\n\n## Experimental design and characterization\n\nThe (Hg,Mn)Te topological insulator weak links used in this study have only a\nsuperficial similarity to previous semiconducting weak link JJs studied under\nan in-plane magnetic field^17. That study explored the effects of inversion\nasymmetry in a non-magnetic (and thus low Zeeman splitting) HgTe\nheterostructure designed to have strong spin\u2013orbit coupling. The spin\u2013orbit\ncoupling strength, which is the product of the Rashba coefficient and the\nelectric field across the quantum well, is strongly dependent on details of\nthe layer stack.\n\nTo explore the pFFLO state, our weak link is engineered in the opposite limit\nfrom that of ref. ^17: we use a highly doped symmetric quantum well in a\nheterostructure with an electrostatic layout chosen to minimize the electric\nfield across the quantum well and, thus, to produce a negligible Rashba\nspin\u2013orbit coupling. The strength of the spin\u2013orbit coupling in the sample is\ndetermined by Shubnikov\u2013de Haas analysis of the longitudinal resistance^21 of\na Hall bar made from the same layer (Supplementary Section 2B). The absence of\nany beating in the Shubnikov\u2013de Haas data indicates negligible spin\u2013orbit\ncoupling in the transport properties of the layer. Moreover, by substituting a\nfew per cent of the Hg with Mn to utilize the resulting giant effective g\nfactor^22,23,24,25, we greatly enhance the Zeeman effect. This strongly\nreduces the magnetic field needed to produce a Zeeman energy E_Z = \u03c0\u0127v_F/2L,\nat which the re-entrant behaviour can be observed. Here, L is the length of\nthe JJ and v_F is the Fermi velocity in the semiconductor.\n\nThis key difference in the junction material allows us to access a distinct\nexperimental regime. In ref. ^17, the large magnetic fields required to reach\nthe 0\u2013\u03c0 transition condition destroy the supercurrent and limit the\nobservations to measuring the differential resistance of the junction in the\nnon-superconducting state. This, in turn, makes temperature-dependent studies\nimpractical. The magnetic dopants incorporated in our weak link reduce the\nrequired critical fields by more than one order of magnitude, allowing us to\ndirectly measure the magnetic field dependence of the critical current, and\nthis over a substantial temperature range.\n\nThe material used for the superconducting leads is MoRe. It has a high upper\ncritical field H_c2 and is connected to the quantum well using a side-contact\ngeometry, as shown in the schematic of Fig. 1a. A picture of one of the\ndevices is shown in Fig. 1b. The critical temperature T_c of the MoRe is ~9.6\nK, which corresponds to a Bardeen\u2013Cooper\u2013Schrieffer (BCS) gap (\u0394) of 1.4 meV.\nThe investigated JJs have a width (W) of 5.5 \u03bcm, and their length (L) varies\nbetween 600 and 1,300 nm, all of which are below the mean free path (l = 1.7\n\u03bcm) in the semiconductor. The JJs are studied under both perpendicular-to-\nplane (H_z) and in-plane (H_x) magnetic fields orthogonal to the current, as\nindicated in the device schematic in Fig. 1a. A schematic of the electrical\ntransport measurement scheme is shown in Fig. 2a.\n\nFig. 2: The in-plane magnetic field dependence of the current\u2013voltage\ncharacteristic.\n\na, A schematic of the d.c. measurement scheme in the quasi-four-probe\nconfiguration. b, The I(V) characteristic at zero magnetic field, indicating\nthe critical current (I_C) and the re-trapping current (I_R). c, The\nFraunhofer pattern of I_C(H_z). d\u2013k, I(V) characteristics taken at the various\nin-plane magnetic fields, indicated in the top of each panel, that are\northogonal to the current direction and at zero perpendicular-to-plane field.\nThe measurements were done at the base temperature of the dilution fridge on\nsample J2.\n\nSource data\n\nFull size image\n\n## Results\n\nAt zero magnetic field and the base temperature of the dilution fridge, an I_C\nof 1.5 \u03bcA is observed, as shown in Fig. 2b for the JJ with L of 950 nm\n(labelled \u2018J2\u2019). Upon applying a perpendicular-to-plane magnetic field H_z,\nthis junction shows a standard Fraunhofer pattern (Fig. 2c). This confirms a\nuniform current distribution across the width W of the JJ^26. Flux focusing\ndue to the Meissner effect from the long stripe-shaped superconducting leads\n(4 \u03bcm wide) determines the flux^27.\n\nFigure 2d\u2013k shows the evolution of the I(V) characteristics as a function of\nthe magnetic field H_x applied in the plane of the sample and orthogonal to\nthe current direction. As H_x increases from 0 to 60 mT, we observe a\nreduction of I_C. Interestingly, as H_x is further increased, I_C begins to\ngrow again until a field of 95 mT is reached, at which it again starts to\ndecrease, reaching zero at 195 mT. These I(V) characteristics demonstrate re-\nentrant superconductivity in the JJ at a very low in-plane magnetic field of\n60 mT.\n\nThis re-entrant behaviour can be seen in more detail by looking directly at\nI_C(H_x), as shown in Fig. 3a. The plotted values of I_C are extracted from\neach I(V) measurement by selecting the current at which a finite voltage\ncriterion of 2 \u03bcV is crossed. Given the 60 \u03a9 resistive state resistance of the\njunction, this criterion sets a threshold of 30 nA on the I_C sensitivity of\nthe measurement. The red shaded region just above the x axis in Fig. 3a\nindicates that the measurements in this 0\u201330 nA range are below the proper\nexperimental resolution.\n\nFig. 3: The magnetic field dependence of the critical current.\n\na, I_C versus applied H_x at zero perpendicular-to-plane field. b, A colour\nplot of I_C as a function of H_z and H_x. The measurements were done at the\nbase temperature of the dilution fridge on junction J2.\n\nSource data\n\nFull size image\n\nRepeating this same process in the presence of an additional magnetic field\nH_z allows us to map out the full magnetic field response of the sample, as\nshown in the colour plot of Fig. 3b. In these wide and long (L > \u03bb_F) JJs, the\nsupercurrent per unit width j_s is given by\n\\\\({j}_{{\\mathrm{s}}}={j}_{{\\mathrm{c}}}({H}_{x})\\sin (\\Delta \\phi (x))\\\\),\nwhere j_c is the Josephson critical-current density (ref. ^26). Applying a\nperpendicular field H_z results in the usual Fraunhofer response due to the\nposition dependence of \u0394\u03c6(x) along W. The Zeeman effect due to H_x directly\naffects the amplitude of j_c. For a sufficiently strong H_x, it can even\nreverse the sign of j_c, inducing a \u03c0 phase shift. In this picture, the\nclearly visible first and second re-entrance nodes at H_x \u2248 60 and 200 mT,\nwhich are roughly independent of H_z, suggest exactly such an amplitude\nmodulation of j_c(H_x) due to a spatial modulation of the pFFLO order\nparameter^8,9,10. It should be noted that, to acquire these data, great care\nhas to be taken to precisely identify the plane of the sample with respect to\nthe magnetic field directions (see Supplementary Section 2D for further\ndetail). This is essential given that, to reveal the interesting structure in\nboth directions, the field range of H_x needs to be about 1,000 times that of\nH_z, such that a mis-alignment of even 1\u00b0 would lead to a noticeable\ndistortion of the data.\n\nAs discussed above, to unambiguously determine the existence of the pFFLO\ncharacter of the state in the presence of H_x, one must examine the\ntemperature dependence of I_C. When no in-plane field H_x is applied, as shown\nin Fig. 4a, the critical current decreases monotonically with increasing\ntemperature. However, when H_x is increased, I_C at the base temperature\nstarts to reduce, effectively vanishing at 60 mT, as shown by the thicker\ncurve in Fig. 4a (and consistent with Fig. 3b). With a further increase in H_x\nup to 100 mT, the critical current at the base temperature I_C (T = 25 mK)\nincreases and the temperature at which the zero critical current feature is\nobserved also increases. This non-monotonic temperature dependence at finite\nH_x can be clearly seen in the colour plot of Fig. 4b, which shows the\ndifferential resistance (dV/dI) extracted from I(V) curves taken for the case\nof H_x = 85 mT plotted as a function of the current through the junction and\ntemperature. The dark-blue area is the zero resistance region, while the paler\ncolours show the resistive state. Clearly, also this temperature dependence\nshows a 0\u2013\u03c0 transition, at a temperature of about 400 mK. Since the non-\nmonotonic behaviour in I_C occurs only in the presence of finite in-plane\nmagnetic field, the re-entrant behaviour in the weak link must be driven by a\nZeeman-energy-like term. This is in contrast to the situation in ref. ^17,\nwhere related in-plane re-entrance effects in HgTe not doped with Mn could be\nattributed to Rashba spin\u2013orbit coupling effects.\n\nFig. 4: The magnetic field and temperature dependence of critical current.\n\na, The temperature dependence of I_C at different H_x. b, A colour plot of\ndV/dI versus current and temperature for H_x = 85 mT.\n\nSource data\n\nFull size image\n\nTo better understand the role of the Zeeman energy, we convert the data from\nFig. 4a to a two-dimensional diagram of I_C(H_x, T) with respect to field and\ntemperature. This plot is shown in Fig. 5a for the L = 950 nm junction J2,\nwhereas Fig. 5b shows a similar plot for J1 (L = 730 nm). In these figures,\nthe supercurrent is normalized to its value at zero field and base\ntemperature, and the zero critical current nodes are identified by the dark-\ngreen colour. Both junctions show qualitatively the same behaviour: at the\nlowest temperature, the first node moves towards lower magnetic field. This\nobservation can be explained by the temperature and field dependence of the\neffective average magnetization of the Mn atoms in the weak link. The\nalignment of the moments of the magnetic doping atoms in response to a\nmagnetic field in dilute magnetic semiconductors is known to lead to a giant\neffective Zeeman effect, mediated through the exchange interaction between the\nd orbitals of Mn and the s\u2013p orbitals of the current carrier electrons. The\neffective Zeeman energy (\\\\({E}_{{\\mathrm{Z}}}^{* }\\\\)) in this case follows\nthe modified Brillouin function (B_5/2) for spin 5/2 (refs. ^28,29,30), given\nby\n\n$${E}_{{\\mathrm{Z}}}^{* }={g}_{0}{\\mu }_{{\\mathrm{B}}}{\\mu }_{0}H-\\Delta\n{E}_{{\\mathrm{max}}}{B}_{5/2}\\left[\\frac{5{g}_{{\\mathrm{Mn}}}{\\mu\n}_{{\\mathrm{B}}}{\\mu }_{0}H}{2{k}_{{\\mathrm{B}}}(T+{T}_{0})}\\right],$$\n\n(1)\n\nwhere g_0 = \u221220 is the g factor for a HgTe quantum well without Mn atoms^31,\n\u03bc_B is the Bohr magneton, \u03bc_0 is the vacuum magnetic permeability, g_Mn = 2 is\nthe g factor for the Mn^2+ ion, T is the temperature of the Mn spin system and\nk_B is the Boltzmann constant. For (Hg, Mn)Te with a Mn concentration of 2.3%,\n\u0394E_max = 4.3 meV is the saturated spin-splitting energy due to the sp\u2013d\nexchange interaction^29,30 and T_0 = 730 mK (refs. ^22,23,24,25) is an\nempirical fitting parameter that phenomenologically accounts for the\nantiferromagnetic coupling between neighbouring Mn spins or to Mn clusters\nwith non-zero spin^32 (for a detailed discussion of this choice of parameters,\nsee Supplementary Section 2F). Because of the argument of the Brillouin\nfunction, as the temperature is reduced, maintaining a constant\n\\\\({E}_{{\\mathrm{Z}}}^{* }\\\\) requires also reducing the magnetic field. This\nexplains the reduction in the magnetic field required to observe the re-\nentrance behaviour at the lowest temperatures of Fig. 5a,b.\n\nFig. 5: Comparing experiment and theory.\n\na,b, A colour plot of the normalized (Norm.)

The y-axis error\nbar estimates the reading uncertainty on the position of the re-entrance\nnodes.\n\nSource data\n\nFull size image\n\nTo analyse the impact of the large Zeeman splitting on the transport, we adapt\nthe model of ref. ^33 for the case of magnetic dopants (see Supplementary\nSection 1 for details). In the clean limit, the critical current is given by\nequation (20) of ref. ^33. This is modified to our case by equating the\nexchange field in the ferromagnet to the effects of giant Zeeman splitting and\ncan thus be rewritten as\n\n$${I}_{{\\mathrm{C}}}\\propto T\\left\\vert \\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{\\omega >\n0}^{\\infty }{f}_{{\\mathrm{s}}}^{\\,2}{\\gamma }^{2}\\frac{\\sin\n(2{E}_{{\\mathrm{Z}}}^{* }L/\\hslash {v}_{{\\mathrm{F}}})}{2{E}_{{\\mathrm{Z}}}^{*\n}L/\\hslash {v}_{{\\mathrm{F}}}}{e}^{\\frac{-L}{l}(1+2\\omega \\tau )}\\right\\vert\n.$$\n\n(2)\n\nThis equation then describes the dependence of the critical current on\ntemperature and \\\\({E}_{{\\mathrm{Z}}}^{* }\\\\). The summation is over the\nMatsubara frequency (where \u0127\u03c9_n = \u03c0k_BT(2n + 1) with n = 0, 1, 2...). v_F =\n6.3 \u00d7 10^5 m s^\u22121 is taken from the established band structure for a HgTe\nquantum well of this thickness and Mn concentration^34 and \u03c4 (= l/v_F) is the\nmomentum relaxation time. \u03b3 is an effective parameter describing the transport\nthrough the hybrid interface. \\\\({f}_{{\\mathrm{s}}}=\\Delta /\\sqrt{{\\Delta\n}^{2}+{(\\hslash {\\omega }_{n})}^{2}}\\\\) is the anomalous Green\u2019s function\ndescribing the superconducting state in the leads.\n\nThe \u03b3 parameter in equation (2), which can be assumed to be temperature and\nmagnetic field independent within the experimental range, is treated as an\noverall normalization. By using equation (2) with the material parameters\ntaken from the above cited literature, we can compute the I_C(H_x, T)/I_C(0,\nT_min) diagram without additional parameters. Colour plots of such simulations\nare shown in Fig. 5c,d for each of the two junctions and show reasonable\nagreement with the data in Fig. 5a,b. Furthermore, the simulation can be\ncompared with the experimental data by looking at the normalized I_C at the\nbase temperature with respect to H_x (Fig. 5e,f). The simulation reasonably\nwell reproduces the position of nodes in magnetic field for both lengths L of\njunctions. The length of the junctions is determined from optical microscope\nimages of the finished samples and has an uncertainty of less than 50 nm\n(limited by pixel size), whereas the y-axis error bar estimates the reading\nuncertainty on the position of the re-entrance nodes. The simulation captures\nnot only the position of the nodes but also the amplitude of the re-entrant\nsupercurrent at higher fields. As an additional comparison, in Fig. 5g,h, we\nlook at the field position of the first and second node for the six studied\ndevices, as a function of device length, again showing that the simulation\ncorrectly captures the experimental observations. Taken as a whole, the\nagreement between the experiment and equation (2) highlighted in Fig. 5\nindicates the Zeeman-driven pFFLO nature of the state responsible for the re-\nentrant superconductivity. To capture any influence of Rashba-type spin\u2013orbit\ncoupling in the low field re-entrant superconductivity would require more\ndetailed studies. Indeed, the agreement is surprisingly good given that\nequation (2) assumes \\\\({E}_{{\\mathrm{Z}}}^{* } > \\hslash /\\tau\\\\), which is\nsatisfied for fields much higher than 24 mT. Equation (1) is empirically well\nestablished for temperatures greater than T_0 and appears to work quite well\nhere despite the fact that applying the equation well below T = T_0 is pushing\nthe range of its tested validity.\n\nNote that a conceptually similar model developed by Pientka et al.^35 was\napplied by Hart et al.^17 to describe their data on a non-magnetic weak link.\nIn the Pientka model, the considered problem is fully one dimensional, with\nonly the current trajectory orthogonal to the JJ width taken into account.\nThis model is sufficient to explain the set of data accessible in Hart et al.\nand indeed also can explain some features of our data such as the magnetic\nfield at which minima in I_C occur. Our probe of higher magnetic fields\nreveals features such as the magnetic field and temperature dependence of I_C\nin the re-entrant lobes, which are not captured in this one-dimensional\npicture. In the same spirit, equation (2) takes the finite width of the JJ\ninto account by averaging over the distribution of possible injection angles\nand reveals the rich physics allowing us to identify FFLO behaviour.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhereas the FFLO state is determined by the properties of the bulk\nsuperconductor, the proximity-induced version of the effect depends on the\nproperties of the weak link, which, as shown here, can be a semiconductor.\nGiven the relative ease with which the transport properties of semiconductors\n(as opposed to those of metals) are affected by magnetic and electric fields\nas well as currents, this platform provides the flexibility to explore FFLO\nphysics in ways that were previously experimentally inaccessible.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Quantum well growth and properties\n\nThe weak link is composed of a 2.3% Mn-doped 11-nm-thick (Hg, Mn)Te quantum\nwell sandwiched between (Hg, Cd)Te layers, grown by molecular beam epitaxy.\nThese parameters place the quantum well in the topological regime^34. This,\nhowever, does not play a role in the results of this paper since these devices\nare all highly n doped. The carrier density and mobility are 8.8 \u00d7 10^11 cm^\u22122\nand 111,000 cm^2 Vs^\u22121, respectively, as determined from measurements on a 180\n\u00d7 540 \u03bcm Hall bar made from the same wafer. This density corresponds to a\nFermi wavelength \u03bb_F = 27 nm and a Fermi energy (E_F) of 97 meV above the\nbottom of the conduction band in our devices.\n\n### Lithography and measurement technique\n\nThe weak-link mesa is patterned using wet-etch techniques^36. The geometry and\ntechnology used to produce the JJs are the same as in ref. ^27.
