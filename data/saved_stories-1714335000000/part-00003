They will\nmove towards food when they sense it, and move around obstacles when they make\ncontact. After viewing a video of a connectome being used to simulate a worm\nbrain and control a GoPiGo robot, I wanted to see if something similar could\nbe done in the browser.\n\nIn this demo, hunger neurons are continuously stimulated. If the worm nears\nfood, food sensing neurons are stimulated. If the worm nears the edge of the\nwindow, nose touch sensory neurons are stimulated.\n\n## Usage\n\nHead on over to heyseth.github.io/worm-sim/ and watch the worm wriggle around.\nClick to place down food. The green dots at the top are a visual\nrepresentation of the connectome, with each dot representing a neuron\n(increased opacity = increased activity). There are buttons to hide the\nconnectome, reset the worm's position, and to clear placed down food.\n\nTo restate, the worm you see on your screen is being controlled entirely by a\nvirtual worm brain. Very cool if you ask me!\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the license.md file for\ndetails.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nHuge thanks to:\n\n  * Timothy Busbice, Gabriel Garrett, Geoffrey Churchill, and all other contributors to the GoPiGo Connectome.\n  * Zach Rispoli, for porting the connectome to JavaScript.\n  * ARTsinn, for their awesome canvas worm demo, which served as inspiration for this project.\n\n## About\n\nSimulate the C.
