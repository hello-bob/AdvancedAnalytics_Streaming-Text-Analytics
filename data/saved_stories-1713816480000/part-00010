Syncretism involves the merging or\nassimilation of several originally discrete traditions, especially in the\ntheology and mythology of religion, thus asserting an underlying unity and\nallowing for an inclusive approach to other faiths. While syncretism in art\nand culture is sometimes likened to eclecticism, in the realm of religion, it\nspecifically denotes a more integrated merging of beliefs into a unified\nsystem, distinct from eclecticism, which implies a selective adoption of\nelements from different traditions without necessarily blending them into a\nnew, cohesive belief system. Syncretism also manifests in politics, known as\nsyncretic politics.\n\n## Nomenclature[edit]\n\nThe English word is first attested in the early 17th century ^[2] It is from\nModern Latin syncretismus, drawing on the Ancient Greek: \u03c3\u03c5\u03b3\u03ba\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2,\nromanized: synkretismos, supposedly meaning \"Cretan federation\"; however, this\nis a spurious etymology from the naive idea in Plutarch's 1st-century AD essay\non \"Fraternal Love (Peri Philadelphias)\" in his collection Moralia. He cites\nthe example of the Cretans, who compromised and reconciled their differences\nand came together in alliance when faced with external dangers. \"And that is\ntheir so-called Syncretism [Union of Cretans]\". More likely as an etymology is\nsun- (\"with\") plus kerannumi (\"mix\") and its related noun, \"krasis\",\n\"mixture\".\n\n## Social and political roles[edit]\n\nThe use of elephant-shaped column brackets in buildings of the Lahore Fort\nreflects Hindu influences on Mughal Architecture during the reign of Akbar.\nIslam forbids representation of living figures.\n\nOvert syncretism in folk belief may show cultural acceptance of an alien or\nprevious tradition, but the \"other\" cult may survive or infiltrate without\nauthorized syncresis. For example, some conversos developed a sort of cult for\nmartyr-victims of the Spanish Inquisition, thus incorporating elements of\nCatholicism while resisting it.\n\nThe Kushite kings who ruled Upper Egypt for approximately a century and the\nwhole of Egypt for approximately 57 years, from 721 to 664 BCE, constituting\nthe Twenty-fifth Dynasty in Manetho's Aegyptiaca, developed a syncretic\nworship identifying their own god Dedun with the Egyptian Osiris. They\nmaintained that worship even after they had been driven out of Egypt. A temple\ndedicated to this syncretic god, built by the Kushite ruler Atlanersa, was\nunearthed at Jebel Barkal.^[3]^[4]\n\nSyncretism was common during the Hellenistic period, with rulers regularly\nidentifying local deities in various parts of their domains with the relevant\ngod or goddess of the Greek Pantheon as a means of increasing the cohesion of\ntheir kingdom. This practice was accepted in most locations but vehemently\nrejected by the Jews, who considered the identification of Yahweh with the\nGreek Zeus as the worst of blasphemy.\n\nThe Roman Empire continued the practice, first by the identification of\ntraditional Roman deities with Greek ones, producing a single Greco-Roman\npantheon, and then identifying members of that pantheon with the local deities\nof various Roman provinces.\n\nSome religious movements have embraced overt syncretism, such as the case of\nmelding Shint\u014d beliefs into Buddhism or the amalgamation of Germanic and\nCeltic pagan views into Christianity during its spread into Gaul, Ireland,\nBritain, Germany and Scandinavia. In later times, Christian missionaries in\nNorth America identified Manitou, the spiritual and fundamental life force in\nthe traditional beliefs of the Algonquian groups, with the God of\nChristianity. Similar identifications were made by missionaries at other\nlocations in the Americas and Africa who encountered a local belief in a\nSupreme God or Supreme Spirit of some kind.\n\nIndian influences are seen in the practice of Shi'i Islam in Trinidad. Others\nhave strongly rejected it as devaluing and compromising precious and genuine\ndistinctions; examples include post-Exile Second Temple Judaism, Islam, and\nmost of Protestant Christianity.^[further explanation needed]^[citation\nneeded]\n\nSyncretism tends to facilitate coexistence and unity between otherwise\ndifferent cultures and world views (intercultural competence), a factor that\nhas recommended it to rulers of multiethnic realms. Conversely, the rejection\nof syncretism, usually in the name of \"piety\" and \"orthodoxy\", may help to\ngenerate, bolster or authenticate a sense of uncompromised cultural unity in a\nwell-defined minority or majority.\n\nAll major religious conversions of populations have had elements from prior\nreligious traditions incorporated into legends or doctrine that endure with\nthe newly converted laity.^[5]\n\n## Religious syncretism[edit]\n\nMain article: Religious syncretism\n\nFurther information: Hellenistic religion, Hellenistic Judaism, Christian\ninfluences in Islam, and Iranian religions \u00a7 Medieval period\n\nSee also: New religious movements\n\nThe god Hermanubis, an example of Greco-Egyptian syncretismThe god Taranis-\nJupiter, an example of Romano-Celtic syncretism\n\nReligious syncretism is the blending of two or more religious belief systems\ninto a new system, or the incorporation into a religious tradition of beliefs\nfrom unrelated traditions. This can occur for many reasons, and the latter\nscenario happens quite commonly in areas where multiple religious traditions\nexist in proximity and function actively in a culture, or when a culture is\nconquered, and the conquerors bring their religious beliefs with them, but do\nnot succeed in entirely eradicating the old beliefs or (especially) practices.\n\nReligions may have syncretic elements to their beliefs or history, but\nadherents of so-labeled systems often frown on applying the label, especially\nadherents who belong to \"revealed\" religious systems, such as the Abrahamic\nreligions, or any system that exhibits an exclusivist approach. Such adherents\nsometimes see syncretism as a betrayal of their pure truth. By this reasoning,\nadding an incompatible belief corrupts the original religion, rendering it no\nlonger true. Indeed, critics of a syncretistic trend may use the word or its\nvariants as a disparaging epithet, as a charge implying that those who seek to\nincorporate a new view, belief, or practice into a religious system pervert\nthe original faith. Non-exclusivist systems of belief, on the other hand, may\nfeel quite free to incorporate other traditions into their own. Keith\nFerdinando notes that the term \"syncretism\" is an elusive one,^[6] and can\nrefer to substitution or modification of the central elements of a religion by\nbeliefs or practices introduced from elsewhere. The consequence under such a\ndefinition, according to Ferdinando, can lead to a fatal \"compromise\" of the\noriginal religion's \"integrity\".^[7]\n\nIn modern secular society, religious innovators sometimes construct new faiths\nor key tenets syncretically, with the added benefit or aim of reducing inter-\nreligious discord. Such chapters often have a side-effect of arousing jealousy\nand suspicion among authorities and ardent adherents of the pre-existing\nreligion. Such religions tend to inherently appeal to an inclusive, diverse\naudience. Sometimes the state itself sponsored such new movements, such as the\nLiving Church founded in Soviet Russia and the German Evangelical Church in\nNazi Germany, chiefly to stem all outside influences.\n\n## Cultures and societies[edit]\n\nMain article: Moral syncretism\n\nAccording to some authors, \"Syncretism is often used to describe the product\nof the large-scale imposition of one alien culture, religion, or body of\npractices over another that is already present.\"^[8] Others such as Jerry H.\nBentley, however, have argued that syncretism has also helped to create\ncultural compromise. It provides an opportunity to bring beliefs, values, and\ncustoms from one cultural tradition into contact with, and to engage different\ncultural traditions. Such a migration of ideas is generally successful only\nwhen there is a resonance between both traditions. While, as Bentley has\nargued, there are numerous cases where expansive traditions have won popular\nsupport in foreign lands, this is not always so.^[9]\n\n### Din-i Ilahi[edit]\n\nAkbar the Great holding a court discussing theology\n\nIn the 16th century, the Mughal emperor Akbar proposed a new religion called\nthe Din-i Ilahi (\"Divine Faith\"). Sources disagree with respect to whether it\nwas one of many Sufi orders or merged some of the elements of the various\nreligions of his empire.^[10]^[11] Din-i Ilahi drew elements primarily from\nIslam and Hinduism but also from Christianity, Jainism, and Zoroastrianism.\nMore resembling a personality cult than a religion, it had no sacred\nscriptures, no priestly hierarchy, and fewer than 20 disciples, all hand-\npicked by Akbar himself. It is also accepted that the policy of sulh-i-kul,\nwhich formed the essence of the D\u012bn-i Il\u0101h\u012b, was adopted by Akbar as a part of\ngeneral imperial administrative policy. Sulh-i-kul means \"universal\npeace\".^[12]^[13]\n\n### Enlightenment[edit]\n\nThe syncretic deism of Matthew Tindal undermined Christianity's claim to\nuniqueness.^[14] The modern, rational, non-pejorative connotations of\nsyncretism arguably date from Denis Diderot's Encyclop\u00e9die articles\nEclecticisme and Syncr\u00e9tistes, H\u00e9notiques, ou Conciliateurs. Diderot portrayed\nsyncretism as the concordance of eclectic sources. Scientific or legalistic\napproaches of subjecting all claims to critical thinking prompted at this time\nmuch literature in Europe and the Americas studying non-European religions\nsuch as Edward Moor's The Hindu Pantheon of 1810, much of which was almost\nevangelistically appreciative by embracing spirituality and creating the space\nand tolerance in particular disestablishment of religion (or its stronger\nform, official secularisation as in France) whereby believers of spiritualism,\nagnosticism, atheists and in many cases more innovative or pre-Abrahimic based\nreligions could promote and spread their belief system, whether in the family\nor beyond.^[citation needed]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Religion portal\n\n  * Confederacy\n  * Conflation\n  * Cultural appropriation\n  * Cultural assimilation\n  * Multiculturalism\n  * Multiple religious belonging\n  * Religious pluralism\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"syncretism\".

Nevertheless, there are points at which the worldview of any people will be found to be incompatible with central elements of the gospel; if conversion to Christianity is to be more than purely nominal, it will necessarily entail the substantial modification of the traditional worldview at such points. Where this does not occur it is the Christian faith which is modified and thus relativised by the worldview, and the consequence is syncretism.
