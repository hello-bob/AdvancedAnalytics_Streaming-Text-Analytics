The ad targeting tech has since been made available for Android\napplications.\n\nThe Topics API allows ads to be targeted at users of Chrome, Edge (soon), and\nAndroid devices based on interests conveyed through online interactions. The\nAPI uses an on-device classifier model to generate a list of interests\ninferred from browsing activity, based on a publicly accessible taxonomy that\npresently includes 469 topics like \"Arts & Entertainment.\"\n\nThe API each week determines \u2013 locally instead of over a network \u2013 a person's\ntop five topics, based on visited sites that implement the Topics API. The\nwebsite publishers and third-party ad providers on sites supporting the Topics\nAPI receive a random list of up to three of the visitor's top five topics over\nthe past three weeks, for a maximum total of five. These interests can be used\nto present ads that reflect what the visitors presumably want to see.\n\nBut the system is complicated and Google's assurances about the privacy\nadvantages of its approach haven't convinced everyone, perhaps as a result of\nthe company's persistent involvement in privacy scandals.\n\nThe CMA on Friday issued its latest update on Google's commitments to\nimplement its Privacy Sandbox ad technologies in a way that doesn't put rivals\nat a disadvantage.\n\n  * Cops cuff man for allegedly framing colleague with AI-generated hate speech clip\n  * Encrypted email service files DMA complaint claiming it vanished from Google Search\n  * UK's Investigatory Powers Bill to become law despite tech world opposition\n  * Google location tracking deal could be derailed by politics\n\nThe report incorporates input from the UK Information Commissioner's Office\n(ICO), which oversees privacy issues. A leaked draft of the ICO's Privacy\nSandbox assessment earlier this week revealed that the ICO still believes the\ntechnology isn't living up to its name. And now those concerns have been\npublicly articulated.\n\nThe CMA report lists almost 80 issues that have yet to be resolved to the\nsatisfaction of UK regulators.\n\n\"The regulators are showing real concern about some significant areas \u2013 from\nlatency and the role of cloud providers through to governance and privacy,\"\nsaid James Rosewell, co-founder of Movement for an Open Web, an advertising\ninterest group, in a statement. \"These are fundamental issues that are not\ngoing to be addressed overnight. The fact that the issues list is growing as\nthe technology gets closer is a sign that Google has tied itself up in knots\nthat it simply can\u2019t unwind.\"\n\nRosewell argues that Google has not put enough thought into the governance of\nthe new ad regime being proposed \u2013 most competitors don't want Google giving\nitself new gatekeeping powers \u2013 and that competing ad targeting schemes should\nbe able to compete fairly in an open market.\n\nAmong the CMA's lingering worries about Google's technology, there's concern\nthat the Topics interest-based ad mechanism doesn't explain itself well.\n\n\"We are concerned that the Topics consent user interface may not adequately\ninform users about how their personal data is used or how the topics generated\nmay be used for purposes wider than interest-based advertising (e.g. as\ndetermined by organizations that decide to use the API),\" the report says,\nadding that Google is planning to revise the Topics API consent interface.\n\nThere's also the possibility that Topics data about people's interests might\nbe used for purposes other than advertising.\n\n\"Based on the ICO's preliminary assessment, we are concerned that topics data\nmay be used for purposes outside that specified by the API, and in so doing\nmay harm the user and breach Applicable Data Protection Legislation,\" the\nreport says, while also observing that \"Google does acknowledge that entities\ncalling the API might use the data for other purposes.\"\n\nAnother worry is that if the taxonomy of interests in the Topics API expands\nsufficiently, there will be a larger number of data points that may prove\nsufficient to identify people. \"We agree with the ICO that future utility-\nbased changes to the taxonomy could introduce new privacy risks,\" the CMA\nreport says.\n\nWeb publishers have their own wish list of fixes, like a way to correct an\nerrant Topics classification of a website and associated interests. The report\nalso covers other APIs like the Protected Audience API and Fenced Frames. It's\nclear Google still has quite a bit of work left to do.\n\nGoogle said in a statement last week that it continues to expect the Privacy\nSandbox to improve upon the not-very-private status quo. \"We've been closely\nengaging with the ICO, and other privacy and competition regulators globally,\nand will continue to do that to reach an outcome that works for users and the\nentire ecosystem,\" the biz said.\n\nIt's not as if Google has a choice while under the regulatory microscope. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Advertising\n  * Google\n  * Privacy\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Advertising\n  * Google\n  * Privacy\n  * Software\n  * United Kingdom\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AdBlock Plus\n  * Android\n  * App\n  * Application Delivery Controller\n  * App stores\n  * Audacity\n  * BBC\n  * Brexit\n  * British Armed Forces\n  * Chrome\n  * Chromium\n  * Confluence\n  * cookies\n  * Database\n  * Digital advertising displays\n  * ESA\n  * Five Eyes\n  * FOSDEM\n  * FOSS\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * Google Cloud Platform\n  * Google I/O\n  * Google Nest\n  * Government of the United Kingdom\n  * Grab\n  * Graphics Interchange Format\n  * G Suite\n  * IDE\n  * Jenkins\n  * Kubernetes\n  * Legacy Technology\n  * LibreOffice\n  * London\n  * Map\n  * Microsoft 365\n  * Microsoft Office\n  * Microsoft Teams\n  * Mobile Device Management\n  * OpenOffice\n  * Parliament of the United Kingdom\n  * Pixel\n  * Privacy Sandbox\n  * Programming Language\n  * QR code\n  * Retro computing\n  * Scotland\n  * Software bug\n  * Software License\n  * Tavis Ormandy\n  * Text Editor\n  * User interface\n  * Visual Studio\n  * Visual Studio Code\n  * WebAssembly\n  * Web Browser\n  * WordPress\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Alphabet\n  * EMEA\n  * Europe\n  * Search Engine\n\n#### More about\n\n10 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Advertising\n  * Google\n  * Privacy\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Advertising\n  * Google\n  * Privacy\n  * Software\n  * United Kingdom\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AdBlock Plus\n  * Android\n  * App\n  * Application Delivery Controller\n  * App stores\n  * Audacity\n  * BBC\n  * Brexit\n  * British Armed Forces\n  * Chrome\n  * Chromium\n  * Confluence\n  * cookies\n  * Database\n  * Digital advertising displays\n  * ESA\n  * Five Eyes\n  * FOSDEM\n  * FOSS\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * Google Cloud Platform\n  * Google I/O\n  * Google Nest\n  * Government of the United Kingdom\n  * Grab\n  * Graphics Interchange Format\n  * G Suite\n  * IDE\n  * Jenkins\n  * Kubernetes\n  * Legacy Technology\n  * LibreOffice\n  * London\n  * Map\n  * Microsoft 365\n  * Microsoft Office\n  * Microsoft Teams\n  * Mobile Device Management\n  * OpenOffice\n  * Parliament of the United Kingdom\n  * Pixel\n  * Privacy Sandbox\n  * Programming Language\n  * QR code\n  * Retro computing\n  * Scotland\n  * Software bug\n  * Software License\n  * Tavis Ormandy\n  * Text Editor\n  * User interface\n  * Visual Studio\n  * Visual Studio Code\n  * WebAssembly\n  * Web Browser\n  * WordPress\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Alphabet\n  * EMEA\n  * Europe\n  * Search Engine\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### UK data watchdog questions how private Google's Privacy Sandbox is\n\nLeaked draft report says stated goals still come up short\n\nSecurity8 days | 3\n\n#### If Britain is so bothered by China, why do these .gov.uk sites use\nChinese ad brokers?\n\nExclusive One wonders why are there adverts on public-sector portals at all\n\nResearch6 days | 106\n\n#### Google cools on cookie phase-out while regulators chew on plans\n\nPrivacy Sandbox slips into 2025 after challenges from UK authorities\n\nSecurity6 days | 10\n\n#### Easing the cloud migration journey\n\nHuawei\u2019s Net5.5G converged IP network can improve cloud performance,\nreliability and security, says the company\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### YouTube now sabotages ad-blocking apps that stream its vids\n\nEFF lambastes latest 'lazy and deliberately malicious move'\n\nApplications14 days | 67\n\n#### Google fires 28 staff after sit-in protest against Israeli cloud deal\nends in arrests\n\nAlphabet Workers Union says bosses refuse to listen to concerns\n\nOff-Prem12 days | 95\n\n#### Apple's 'incredibly private' Safari is not so private in Europe\n\nInfosec eggheads find iGiant left EU iOS 17 users open to being tracked around\nthe web\n\nSecurity8 hrs | 9\n\n#### Encrypted email service files DMA complaint claiming it vanished from\nGoogle Search\n\nTuta cries foul, Chocolate Factory denies service unreachable\n\nApplications4 days | 62\n\n#### Tokyo wags finger at Google for blocking Yahoo Japan!
