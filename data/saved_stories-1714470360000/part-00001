Geese are a seasonal presence at the airport, R\u00daV reports, and as they\npose a risk to planes, people, and themselves, the task of shooing them away\nis an important one.\n\n## Honking back\n\nGeese flock to this area by the thousands each spring, and have likely done so\nfor centuries before this airport was ever here. However, flights need to\ndepart from the airport in the morning, and before they can, employees of the\nairport move up and down the runway, scaring geese away with the honking of\nhorns.\n\nTo the east of the runway is a field, where geese will often assemble to feed.\nWalking dogs in this area is banned, as they might scare the geese at an\ninopportune moment, i.e., the take-off or landing of a plane.\n\n## Many tools in the toolbox\n\nHonking horns is not the only weapon in the airport\u2019s arsenal against the\ngeese. Laser pointers also keep the geese at bay, effectively enough, as well\nas high-pitched whistles that geese find unpleasant and keep them at bay.\n\nBut there is also the concern about younglings, as geese are prone to build\ntheir nests near the runway. For this, fences are used, or sometimes the eggs\nthemselves are moved.\n\nNonetheless, geese and airplanes alike use very similar flight paths in this\npart of Iceland, and others. It is likely that keeping geese away from their\nlarger, mechanical cousins will be an ongoing job for as long as airplanes\nexist in Iceland.\n\nLike reading about Iceland?
