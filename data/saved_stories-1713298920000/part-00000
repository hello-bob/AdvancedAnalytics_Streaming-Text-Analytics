That\u2019s a bit counterintuitive if you think of\nanalog video as \u201cold\u201d and assume that generating an analog video signal would\nbe trivial with our powerful modern hardware. But there are many ways in which\nanalog signals are tricky and that\u2019s especially true if you want something\nlike VGA output, which requires very precise timing. That\u2019s why it is so\nimpressive that Slu4 was able to build this retro computer with just an\nArduino Nano and a shift register.\n\nThis was no simple feat and it really showcases Slu4\u2019s programming prowess.\nHis creation can output 320\u00d7200 resolution VGA video while reading PS/2\nkeyboard inputs, with enough processing power leftover to handle basic video\ngame logic and graphics. He demonstrates that with a Tetris-like games that\nruns very smoothly. And Slu4 says that it is even possible to add 16 colors\nper row, though he doesn\u2019t show that in action.\n\nSlu4 first achieved a similar result a few years ago, but that required\nseveral IC (Integrated Circuit) chips. This version only needs one: a standard\n74HC166 shift register. That helped him overcome some of the challenges\nrelated to VGA timing, which the Nano\u2019s ATmega328 microcontroller can just\nbarely keep up with. This did necessitate some low-level programming to\nmaximize efficiency, but Slu4 was able to pull it off. Even more impressive,\nhe was able to read PS/2 keyboard input at the same time so the player can\ncontrol the game.\n\nBoards:Nano\n\nCategories:Arduino\n\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.
