AI\n\n# Building The Power Grid Of Tomorrow\n\nApril 30, 2024 Lalit Lopez, Dheerendra Panwar AI Comments Off on Building The\nPower Grid Of Tomorrow\n\nThe energy sector is undergoing a monumental shift as the power grid struggles\nto accommodate growing demand and the complexity of modern energy systems.\n\nA major driver of this change is the increasing use of distributed renewable\nenergy sources such as wind, solar and geothermal. These have very different\nlocation considerations compared to traditional forms of electricity\ngeneration and require the construction of thousands of miles of new\ntransmission lines to connect solar and wind farms with power consumers. More\nimportantly, their power output varies significantly throughout the year. This\nmakes forecasting and managing generation a much more complex and data-\nintensive process.\n\nPatterns of consumption are further complicated due to rooftop solar,\nmicrogrids and other local systems that change traditional models of\nconsumption and generation. While these developments are critical for\ntransitioning toward a more sustainable energy future, they result in a much\nmore complex power grid for which traditional control models and Demand\nResponse Management (DRM) tools are inadequate.\n\nAt the same time, demand growth has \u201cshot up\u201d from 2.6 percent in 2022 to 4.7\npercent in 2023, meaning electricity demand is expected to more than double by\n2040, with electric vehicles and power-hungry devices adding a significant\nload to the grid. That doubling in volume will require a doubling of\ninfrastructure and resources to deliver the electricity.\n\nElectrical utilities are challenged to meet this surging demand for power\nwhile navigating rapid changes in the way electricity is produced and\nconsumed. Combined with new and emerging regulations, cyberthreats and\nconstant vigilance against natural disasters, these challenges are changing an\nalready complex system into one that cannot scale effectively under current\ncontrol and DRM architectures.\n\nTo meet these challenges, utilities are modernizing to transform the grid from\npassive to active, and from unidirectional to bidirectional. This\ntransformation is changing the fundamental operation from a rigid operational\ntechnology (OT)-centric, one-way energy flow model to a more dynamic, two-way,\ndata-driven model that supports intermittent renewable resources, battery\nstorage and demand response programs. Grid modernization will involve digital\nsolutions that could lead to potential cybersecurity issues that need to be\naddressed too. By harnessing the power of cutting-edge technologies and\nstrategic planning, electric utilities are paving the way for a future where\nreliable, affordable, clean, and cost-effective energy can be a reality.\n\n### Adopting New Toolsets And Strategies\n\nAs utilities navigate the transition to new ways of generating and consuming\npower, system administration needs to evolve along with it. Tools for more\nintelligent, modernized systems are available to help navigate this\ntransition, such as grid-scale energy storage to help smooth out\ndemand/generation shifts and software-driven automation that can balance\ndynamic producers and consumers while maintaining grid resiliency and\nstability. However, in many cases these haven\u2019t been deployed yet because of\nregulatory burdens, lack of institutional knowledge and the big up-front cost\nof the transition.\n\nThe evolution of automation and control systems focuses on the hundreds of\nthousands of electrical substations that interconnect and protect the\nelectrical grid. As a member of the vPAC (virtual protection, automation, and\ncontrol) alliance, Dell Technologies is working with partners such as ABB,\nSchneider Electric, GE Vernova, VMware, Phoenix Contact, Moxa, Microsystem,\nand Mienberg to create virtualized digital solutions for the grid. This\nvirtualization approach creates open systems where multiple ISVs can\nparticipate and create innovative solutions.\n\nThe solutions are designed to improve resiliency and flexibility while\nreducing complexity and cost for greenfield or for modernization of brownfield\nsubstations. By standardizing on a common hardware platform and introducing\nvirtualization at the edge, the vPAC solution can consolidate substation\ninfrastructure to reduce appliance sprawl, while also reducing ongoing\noperations and maintenance costs.\n\nHowever, to transform the grid in ways that enable it to keep up with future\nenergy demands also requires taking a long view toward incorporating cutting-\nedge technologies that takes DRM to the next level.\n\n### AI For DRM\n\nThe age of artificial intelligence (AI) is here, and AI has the ability to\ntransform grid management for the future. Trained AI models can be set to\ncollect and analyze data from across the grid \u2013 from power stations to\npipelines to weather forecasting systems \u2013 to vastly improve DRM results over\ntraditional automation systems. The benefits of this approach include:\n\n  * More accurate demand forecasting: The ability to analyze vast amounts of historical data, weather patterns and other relevant factors helps AI forecast energy demand with greater speed and accuracy than traditional automation.\n  * Real-time response: AI systems can evaluate multiple factors simultaneously and make dynamic adjustments to optimize demand response in real time.\n  * Flexibility and scalability: AI can handle a wide range of demand response strategies, from load shifting to dynamic pricing, and can scale nearly without limits to accommodate changes in grid size and complexity.\n  * Self-learning: AI models improve over time by analyzing feedback and performance data to refine their decisions and achieve better outcomes.\n\n### The Future Of Energy Requires A Trusted Partner\n\nElectric grid modernization is not a one-time project but a continuous process\nthat requires strategic planning and relentless innovation. By embracing this\nprocess, utilities can be ready to meet the evolving demands of customers,\ngovernments and society.\n\nModernizing infrastructure improves flexibility, reliability, efficiency,\nsustainability and cybersecurity. It enables large-scale adoption and\nintegration of renewable distributed energy resources for improved efficiency,\nmanagement and resiliency.\n\nAs we replace analog components with digital, the substations of today will\ntransform into mini data centers capable of managing electricity supply and\ndemand for future needs. Dell Technologies and our partners at vPAC will be an\nimportant part of that future. Currently, the Dell NativeEdge operations\nsoftware platform is already capable of streamlining edge operations at scale\nthrough centralized management, secure device onboarding, zero-touch\ndeployment and automated management of infrastructure and applications. As\nsuch, it lays the foundation for efficient and consistent utility operations\nfrom the edge to multicloud environments.\n\nBy modernizing to harness the power of cutting-edge technologies and\nstrategies, electric utilities can pave the way to reliable, affordable,\nclean, and cost-effective energy. Dell Technologies is working alongside\nelectric utilities to help empower the future, secure our energy\ninfrastructure and build a brighter and more sustainable world for generations\nto come.\n\nLearn more about energy solutions by viewing the Edge Resource Library as well\nas this recent energy webinar.\n\nThis article was commissioned by Dell Technologies.\n\n#### Sign up to our Newsletter\n\nFeaturing highlights, analysis, and stories from the week directly from us to\nyour inbox with nothing in between.
