They raised concerns that this will lead to a decline in quality and diversity within the creative industries.\n  * Even those respondents who were more optimistic that generative AI systems can be used ethically (for instance, as tools to improve efficiency and accessibility) reiterated that ethical concerns are a primary reason to avoid the use of generative AI systems at this stage.\n\n## The need for regulation and consent\n\nThere was an almost unanimous consensus among respondents about the need for\nregulation of generative AI: to ensure that consent is sought from copyright\nholders before their work is used to develop systems, that credit and\ncompensation are given, and that the outputs of generative AI systems are\nlabelled as such.\n\n  * Almost all of respondents (94%) want credit and compensation and to be asked for consent (95%) when their work is used to develop generative AI systems or to enable AI-generated output.\n  * Almost all respondents (95%) call for Government to introduce safeguards and regulation to ensure compliance with these measures of consent, compensation and transparency.\n  * In a clear message to publishers and other organisations about the importance of transparency in all uses of AI software, the overwhelming majority of respondents (over 9 in 10) believe that publishers and other organisations should state prominently when generative AI has been used to assist with audio, video, covers and illustrations, decision-making, editing and translation.\n  * Respondents also expressed ethical concerns about generative AI systems, with many highlighting biases and inaccuracies in AI-generated content, worries about copyright infringement, misuse of personal data, and the exploitation of fellow creators\u2019 works without consent or remuneration.\n  * Almost all respondents (97%) believe consumers deserve transparency and should be made aware when generative AI systems have generated all or a portion of what they are reading, viewing or hearing.\n\n## The SoA response\n\nThe survey findings highlight that while generative AI has the potential to be\nuseful to some creators, there is an urgent need for action, and commitment to\nconsent, remuneration and transparency measures, with an unambiguous message\nto developers, government and industry to respect the rights of human creators\nwhen developing, using and regulating for these tools.\n\n  * The developers of generative AI systems must commit to transparency and ethical development, and engage with rightsholders\u2019 \u2013 collectively and individually \u2013 about consent, credit and remuneration.\n  * There is an urgent need for Government regulation of generative AI systems to ensure these systems are developed and used ethically and lawfully \u2013 with requirements for transparency, consent, credit, labelling and remuneration.\n  * The Government needs to uphold copyright laws in the UK and strengthen enforcement mechanisms.\n  * We reiterate our call for AI developers to engage with the creative industries to develop models for remunerating authors for past infringement and future use, including by way of collective licensing models.\n  * Publishing and the creative industries must commit to protecting human creativity and authorship.\n  * We urge all SoA members to vote in our upcoming EGM (2 May 2024) to assert that they do not consent to the use of their works to develop AI systems.\n\nCommenting on the survey findings, chair of the Creators\u2019 Rights Alliance and\noutgoing SoA chief executive Nicola Solomon said:\n\n> The generative AI landscape has evolved fast. Two years ago, these were\n> niche systems but they have quickly become global, mass-market products. We\n> raised concerns then about the possible future impact on creative careers.\n> Today, that impact is already felt acutely by more and more creators \u2013 from\n> translators and illustrators to journalists and educational writers. No one\n> expects generative AI to be un-invented, and we all know its potential to be\n> a powerful and useful tool. But it is not too late to ensure that it is\n> developed and used ethically, and within existing copyright frameworks. Once\n> the world moves beyond the wow factor of each new system release, generative\n> AI must remain a tool to support and enhance human-made creative work, not a\n> cheap alternative to replace it.\n\n## About the survey\n\nThroughout January 2024, the SoA ran a survey of its 12,500 members and other\nauthors, and received 787 responses.\n\nThe respondents included writers of fiction and non-fiction, scriptwriters,\npoets and journalists, as well as illustrators and translators \u2013 many well-\nestablished, others early in their careers, and both traditionally and self-\npublished.\n\nRegardless of type of author and career stage, almost all respondents called\nfor transparency from developers, safeguards introduced by Government, credit\nand compensation when work is used, and ethical approaches both to the\ndevelopment of generative AI systems and in practice when they are used by\nindustry.\n\nMany thanks to everyone who shared their views and experience in the survey.\nThe information will be invaluable as we continue to lobby Government and\nindustry.\n\n## What can authors do?\n\n  * Register now to vote and take part in our upcoming EGM on 2 May 2024\n  * Read the SoA\u2019s Practical steps for authors\n  * Read the SoA position statement: Where we stand on artificial intelligence\n  * Don\u2019t hesitate to get in touch with any contract queries or to share your experience and feedback: info@societyofauthors.org.\n\nPrevPreviousExtraordinary General Meeting\n\nNextSoA welcomes cross-party parliamentary report on creator remunerationNext\n\n### SoA welcomes cross-party parliamentary report on creator remuneration\n\n12 April 2024\n\nThe report echoes and endorses SoA calls for better contract terms, consent\nand remuneration mechanisms from AI developers and the appointment of a\nFreelance Commissioner\n\n### Publishers demand that tech companies seek consent before using copyright-\nprotected works to develop AI systems\n\n11 March 2024\n\nThe letter from the Publishers Association, which represents over 180\npublishers, calls on developers of generative artificial intelligence systems\nto no longer use rights-protected works without express licence\n\n### \u2018Victory for workers\u2019 rights\u2019 \u2013 Abrams and Jolly vs Oxford University\n\n23 February 2024\n\nJudge rules in favour of authors following six-year dispute\n\nSubscribe\n\nLogin\n\n4 Comments\n\nNewest\n\nOldest Most Voted\n\nInline Feedbacks\n\nView all comments\n\nAli Saad\n\n23 April 2024 07:53\n\nCould I know if the respondents, especially translators, included Arabic\nspeakers?
