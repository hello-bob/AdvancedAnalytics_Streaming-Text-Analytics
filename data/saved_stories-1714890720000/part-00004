As it turns out,\na video the billionaire posted of Optimus, the company\u2019s much-hyped humanoid\nrobot, was actually being controlled by a human slightly off-screen. And it\u2019s\ninteresting to see robot manufacturers now include assurances in their videos\nthat they\u2019re not doing the same deceptive magic trick as Musk.\n\n#### Related Content\n\nThis New Robot Is So Far Ahead of Elon Musk's Optimus That It's Almost\nEmbarrassing\n\nApple Vision Pro Sales Slump, Robot Weapons Get Scarier, TikTok Ban Is Here\nand More\n\nThe Elon Musk Twitter Saga, Part 1 of Who Knows?\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nview video\n\nThe Elon Musk Twitter Saga, Part 1 of Who Knows?\n\nFirst, a quick lesson in recent history if you\u2019re not familiar with the story.\nMusk has been hyping up Optimus recently, pledging that Tesla would eventually\ndeliver an amazing new robot that people would buy in stores. He first\nannounced his robot in the summer of 2021, but it was just someone literally\ndressed in a robot costume.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nThis New Robot Is So Far Ahead of Elon Musk's Optimus That It's Almost\nEmbarrassing\n\nApple Vision Pro Sales Slump, Robot Weapons Get Scarier, TikTok Ban Is Here\nand More\n\nThe Elon Musk Twitter Saga, Part 1 of Who Knows?\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nThe Elon Musk Twitter Saga, Part 1 of Who Knows?\n\nMusk often posts videos of Optimus, but they\u2019ve been underwhelming, to say the\nleast. Finally, when Musk posted a video back in January of Optimus folding a\nshirt, eagle-eyed viewers noticed a hand that kept slipping into frame,\nclearly showing someone was actually operating the robot.\n\nA video released by Elon Musk in January, with a red arrow annotation showing\nthe teleoperator of the robotGif: Tesla / Gizmodo\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe technique here is called \u201cteleoperation,\u201d and has been used in robotics\nsince the 1940s. Essentially someone moves their own hand and the robot mimics\nthe movement. It\u2019s cool for mid-20th-century tech, but it\u2019s not the kind of\nautonomous robot movements that people here in the 21st century expect for\ncutting-edge and futuristic products.\n\nAnd all of that brings us to an interesting phenomenon we\u2019re starting to see\nin the wake of Musk getting embarrassed by his robot fakery. Robot companies\nare now including notices when they post new demo videos that make it clear\nthe machine is operating autonomously.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne example is a new video from Chinese robot maker Astribot. The company\nposted a new video this week, available on YouTube, showing the Astribot S1\ndoing a number of tasks, including everything from pouring a glass of wine to\nironing a shirt. The robot can even pull a tablecloth from underneath a stack\nof wine glasses, a trick we all half-expect to fail spectacularly.\n\nAstribot S1: Hello World!\n\nThe Astribot S1 even folds a shirt in the new video, just like Optimus, but\nyou\u2019ll notice something really interesting in the lower left-hand corner.\nThose words, \u201cno teleoperation,\u201d probably wouldn\u2019t have been necessary before\nMusk tried to pull a fast one back in January. But now, as you can see below,\nit\u2019s a way for robot companies to reassure viewers their robot is actually\ndoing something autonomously without an invisible human hand guiding the\nprocess.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScreenshot: Astribot /YouTube\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just Astribot. The robot company Figure, which uses OpenAI\nsoftware for its vision software, recently made clear it wasn\u2019t using\nteleoperation, or teleop, in a very impressive demo released in March.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFigure co-founder Brett Adcock explained the video on X, \u201cThe video is showing\nend-to-end neural networks. There is no teleop. Also, this was filmed at 1.0x\nspeed and shot continuously.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCanadian robotics company Sanctuary AI released a new video in April that also\nincluded a slate explaining that its robot was \u201cautonomous,\u201d reassuring\nviewers there wasn\u2019t any weird teleoperating puppetry at work.\n\nSanctuary AI - Phoenix at Human-Equivalent Speed\n\nMusk has a long way to go to catch up to the most innovative robot companies\nlike Boston Dynamics, which just recently retired the hydraulic version of its\nrobot Atlas to devote time to an electric version. But at least he helped\nprovide a public service by increasing transparency in the robotics space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNobody wants to get caught fudging a demo. That\u2019s the kind of thing that makes\npeople incredibly reluctant to trust you in the future. At least when Musk\nbrought out a human dancing in a robot suit everybody knew it was fake.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
