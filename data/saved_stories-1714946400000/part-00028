Hazel was able to bring the tabs\nback to life via a Firefox profile cache, however, and tells PCMag that\nreloading the full session took \"no more than a minute.\"\n\n\"I feel like a part of me is restored,\" Hazel wrote on X once the Firefox tabs\nhad returned.\n\nThe Firefox fan tells PCMag in a message that she keeps so many tabs open for\nnostalgia reasons. \"I like to scroll back and see clusters of tabs from months\nago\u2014it's like a trip down memory lane on whatever I was doing/learning\nabout/thinking about,\" she says.\n\nSurprisingly, all those tabs haven't impacted the computer's performance.\n\"Firefox is quite memory efficient and isn't actually loading the websites\nunless I click on the tab\u2014so it's not very resource intensive,\" Hazel says.\n\nA Mozilla rep confirms to PCMag that having tons of Firefox tabs open consumes\n\"practically no memory whatsoever.\"\n\n\"We\u2019ve been working hard on the performance of Firefox over the last several\nyears, and we\u2019re glad to see the results of those efforts paying off,\" Mozilla\nadds.\n\nBy comparison, rival browser Google Chrome has historically used up more than\nits fair share of computer memory, though Google has taken some steps to\ncombat that. A quick PCMag test shows that 10 Chrome tabs on a Windows 11 PC\nwith 32GB of RAM and 2TB of NVMe SSD storage take up over 2,000MB, or 12.5% of\nPC memory, so there's still room for improvement (Hazel's massive Firefox\nsession file is just 70MB).\n\nMozilla also shared that new features are on the horizon to help tab-saving\nenthusiasts. \"We\u2019re working hard to provide people with even better tools for\nmanaging dozens to thousands of tabs. While we think it\u2019s amazing that anyone\nhas 7,000 active tabs, it also shows the degree to which tab management is a\ncommon problem,\" the Mozilla rep said.\n\nWhile Firefox users can already create different user profiles, Mozilla says\nit plans to roll out a new profiles feature and a new tab organization feature\nlater this year; Google is also testing the latter on Chrome. In the meantime,\nthere are some third-party Firefox add-ons that can help manage tons of tabs.\n\n##### More Inside PCMag.com\n\n  * How to Master Google Password Manager\n  * Shut Down Web Tracking: How to Switch From Google Chrome to the Brave Browser\n  * Google to Fight Cookie Hijacking With Encryption Keys for Chrome Browser\n  * Google Will Delete Tons of Data on Chrome's Incognito Mode Users\n  * Microsoft Is Injecting Bing Ads Into Google Chrome...Again\n\n### About Kate Irwin\n\nI\u2019m a reporter covering early morning news.
