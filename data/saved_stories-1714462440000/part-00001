Each\nincludes X-ray data collected by Chandra over about two decades. They show\ndramatic changes in the debris and radiation remaining after the explosion of\ntwo massive stars in our galaxy.\n\nThe Crab Nebula, the result of a bright supernova explosion seen by Chinese\nand other astronomers in the year 1054, is 6,500 light-years from Earth. At\nits center is a neutron star, a super-dense star produced by the supernova. As\nit rotates at about 30 times per second, its beam of radiation passes over the\nEarth every orbit, like a cosmic lighthouse.\n\nAs the young pulsar slows down, large amounts of energy are injected into its\nsurroundings. In particular, a high-speed wind of matter and anti-matter\nparticles plows into the surrounding nebula, creating a shock wave that forms\nthe expanding ring seen in the movie. Jets from the poles of the pulsar spew\nX-ray-emitting matter and antimatter particles in a direction perpendicular to\nthe ring.\n\nOver 22 years, Chandra has made many observations of the Crab Nebula. With\nthis long runtime, astronomers see clear changes in both the ring and the jets\nin the new movie. Previous Chandra movies showed images taken from much\nshorter time periods\u2014a 5-month period between 2000 and 2001 and over 7 months\nbetween 2010 and 2011 for another.\n\nThe longer timeframe highlights mesmerizing fluctuations, including whip-like\nvariations in the X-ray jet that are only seen in this much longer movie. A\nnew set of Chandra observations will be conducted later this year to follow\nchanges in the jet since the last Chandra data was obtained in early 2022.\n\nCrab Nebula timelapse:\n\n00:00\n\n-00:21\n\nCredit: Chandra X-ray Center\n\nThe second billing in this doubleheader is just as spectacular. Cassiopeia A\n(Cas A for short) is the remains of a supernova that is estimated to have\nexploded about 340 years ago in Earth's sky. While other Chandra movies of Cas\nA have previously been released, including one with data extending from 2000\nto 2013, this new movie is substantially longer, featuring data from 2000\nthrough to 2019.\n\nThe outer region of Cas A shows the expanding blast wave of the explosion. The\nblast wave is composed of shock waves, similar to the sonic booms generated by\na supersonic aircraft. These expanding shock waves are sites where particles\nare being accelerated to energies that are higher than the most powerful\naccelerator on Earth, the Large Hadron Collider.\n\nAs the blast wave travels outwards, it encounters surrounding material and\nslows down, generating a second shock wave that travels backward relative to\nthe blast wave, analogous to a traffic jam traveling backward from the scene\nof an accident on a highway.\n\nCas A has been one of the most highly observed targets and publicly released\nimages from the Chandra mission. It was Chandra's official first light image\nin 1999 after the Space Shuttle Columbia launched into orbit and quickly\ndiscovered a point source of X-rays in Cas A's center for the first time,\nlater confirmed to be a neutron star.\n\nOver the years, astronomers have used Chandra to discover evidence for\n\"superfluid\" inside Cas A's neutron star, to reveal that the original massive\nstar may have turned inside out as it exploded, and to take an important step\nin pinpointing how giant stars explode.\n\nChandra has also mapped the elements forged inside the star, which are now\nmoving into space to help seed the next generation of stars and planets. More\nrecently, Chandra data was combined with data from NASA's James Webb Space\nTelescope to help determine the origin of mysterious structures within the\nremnant.\n\nCassiopeia A timelapse:\n\n00:00\n\n-00:21\n\nCredit: Chandra X-ray Center\n\nThe images used in the latest Cas A movie have been processed using a state-\nof-the-art processing technique led by Yusuke from Rikkyo University in Japan\nto capitalize on Chandra's sharp X-ray vision fully. The paper describing\ntheir work was published in The Astrophysical Journal and is available online.\n\nThese two movies show Chandra's capabilities of documenting changes in\nastronomical objects over human timeframes. Such movies would not be possible\nwithout Chandra's archives, which serve as public repositories for the data\ncollected over Chandra's nearly 25 years of operations.\n\nCredit: Chandra X-ray Center\n\nMore information: Yusuke Sakai et al, Richardson\u2013Lucy Deconvolution with a\nSpatially Variant Point-spread Function of Chandra: Supernova Remnant\nCassiopeia A as an Example, The Astrophysical Journal (2023).
