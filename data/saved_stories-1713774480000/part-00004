Can\nthey coexist?\n\nApr 12, 2024\n\n6 min read\n\nspace rockets ssto skylon starship\n\nAs a space nerd, I love learning about the craziest rocket concepts that have\ncome up over the years (and there certainly have been quite a lot). One\ncategory of concept intrigues me in particular: single-stage-to-orbit, or\nSSTO. This type of spacecraft can reach orbit without the need for detachable\nboosters or other staged hardware. This is quite easy to achieve on a body\nlike the Moon, given its low gravity and lack of atmosphere. SSTOs are also\nfeasible on Mars, as Mars has lower gravity and a very thin atmosphere.\nHowever, Earth\u2019s higher gravity and thicker atmosphere make SSTOs fairly\ntricky to pull off; nevertheless, it\u2019s doable, and so there have been numerous\ndesigns proposed.\n\nMany SSTO designs have a traditional rocket form factor, with the exception\nthat the fuel tank is conical rather than cylindrical (the DC-X is a good\nexample of this). However, the spaceplane form factor is also common and\narguably sports some benefits: at takeoff, you can use the atmosphere to your\nadvantage as it generates lift, and you can just land on a runway instead of\nhaving to fool around with parachutes or retropropulsive landings (a la Falcon\n9). In fact, as far as I can tell, the spaceplane-style SSTO is the more\npopular SSTO style among Kerbal Space Program players; browsing the KSP\nsubreddit shows both spaceplanes and rockets, but spaceplanes are far more\ncommon.\n\n> Of course, what goes in KSP doesn\u2019t necessarily go in real life. While\n> Kerbin\u2019s gravity and atmospheric pressure are similar to Earth\u2019s, it is only\n> about a tenth of the size of Earth, making it far easier to get to orbit.\n> This makes it very easy to take a large fuel tank, slap a Vector on the\n> bottom, and get 4 km/s of delta-V, which is enough to get to orbit and back\n> with a single stage.\n\n## Skylon\n\nSkylon stands out among spaceplane SSTO designs for various reasons. For\nstarters, its SABRE engines can run in an airbreathing mode, which reduces the\namount of liquid oxygen that Skylon has to carry (which in turn allows it to\ncarry more hydrogen fuel), but also function just fine when burning hydrolox.\nFurthermore, it\u2019s the only SSTO spaceplane that is in active development;\nwhile not much news is forthcoming from its developer Reaction Engines, it\nappears that they are still working on SABRE and Skylon.\n\nHowever, Skylon has been in development since the 1980s. It has its roots in\nthe HOTOL spaceplane; while the HOTOL project was ultimately cancelled by the\nBritish government, the people behind it didn\u2019t give up the idea of a\nspaceplane with a dual-mode engine, eventually starting Reaction Engines to\ndevelop Skylon as a sort of second iteration on the concept. Since then, we\u2019ve\nseen the end of the space shuttle and the rise of Falcon 9, with Starship\nlooming on the horizon. We\u2019re no longer in an era where rocket launches are\nprohibitively expensive; in fact, if you just want to send a CubeSat into\norbit, you can do so quite cheaply. SpaceX currently estimates a launch cost\nof $300,000 for a 1U CubeSat weighing up to fifty kilograms on one of their\nrideshare missons. In other words, if you have three hundred grand burning a\nhole in your pocket, you can get sweet bragging rights by launching your own\nsatellite! And it will only get cheaper: when SpaceX starts offering rideshare\nlaunches on Starship, costs will likely drop significantly due to Starship\u2019s\nimproved efficiency (not to mention its reusable second stage, which\nrepresents an enormous savings on its own).\n\nAt this point, then, should we be throwing in the towel on Skylon? Does it\neven have a place in today\u2019s landscape, or does Starship completely obsolete\nSkylon?\n\n## By the numbers\n\nI\u2019m not going to use mass-to-orbit as a deciding factor, because Starship\nwould beat every other rocket out there, and besides, just because we need\nsuper-heavy-lift rockets for some payloads doesn\u2019t mean we should use them for\nevery single satellite that is ever launched. Instead, I\u2019ll try to make a more\nfair comparison based on the payload fraction and launch costs of each\nvehicle. Please keep in mind that while I\u2019ve tried to get accurate numbers\nhere, you should treat everything said here as a rough calculation, as Skylon\nis still operation in the theoretical realm and the numbers given for Starship\nare likely not extremely precise. Additionally, SpaceX is continually\niterating Starship for more performance, so we could easily see the numbers\nchange in another year or so. I\u2019ve also converted every number to freedom\nunits, so there could be slight precision losses from that as well.\n\nAccording to its manual, Skylon has a payload capacity of 16.5 tons, while\nSpaceX says that Starship can launch up to 150 tons. Given Skylon\u2019s 345 ton\nmass and Starship\u2019s 5000 ton mass (Wikipedia), we can calculate a payload\nfraction of 4.8% for Skylon and 3% for Starship. While this seems to point to\nSkylon, the cost per launch tells a different story: Skylon\u2019s estimated cost\nper launch is $10 millon. While we don\u2019t know the exact numbers for Starship,\nElon Musk has claimed that costs could fall as low as a few million dollars\nper launch. Even if Starship cost the same to launch as Skylon, it still has a\nclear win in cost per pound to orbit: in this scenario, Skylon would cost\n$302.39 per pound to orbit, while Starship would cost just $33.33 per pound to\norbit.\n\nSince numbers don\u2019t lie, you\u2019d be forgiven if you immediately wrote off Skylon\nat this point. However, I think there\u2019s one more thing we need to consider.\n\n## Apples to oranges\n\nSkylon and Starship are both orbital launch vehicles that aim to decrease the\ncost to launch while promoting reusability, but that\u2019s about where the\nsimilarities end, as Skylon leans into the SSTO spaceplane design while\nStarship embraces traditional rocket designs alongside retropropulsive\nlanding. Clearly, we can\u2019t properly compare these vehicles without weighing\nthese differences, and I think this is where Skylon gets an opportunity to\nshine.\n\nTraditional reentry capsules (think Apollo) tend to pull many Gs on reentry,\nwhich causes a certain level of discomfort to the crew. I couldn\u2019t find\nnumbers on the projected G-forces on either Starship or Skylon, but Skylon has\na big advantage in this department: its wings. As a craft that is capable of\ngliding, Skylon is capable of taking a much shallower reentry path that\nreduces the overall stress on the vehicle. In an age where spacecraft are\nbeing proposed for use as long-range passenger transport vehicles and various\ncompanies are developing space stations for commercial or tourist use, Skylon\ncould become the perfect crew transport vehicle to reduce stress on\npassengers, both at launch and reentry. Given that Reaction Engines claimed an\nintended crew capacity of 30 or 40, Skylon could become the luxury space\ntravel option, while a trip on Starship would be a bit more like flying\neconomy: less expensive and less comfortable. And it\u2019s not necessarily just\npeople; Skylon could potientially enable us to launch equipment that is much\nmore delicate to further scientific research.\n\n## It\u2019s up to Reaction Engines now\n\nWith all this in mind, I\u2019m optimistic that there is still a place for Skylon\nin Starship\u2019s world. At this point, we just need Reaction Engines to pull\nthrough and actually build the thing. Until then, we\u2019ll just have to keep\nflying the traditional rockets.\n\n# Comments\n\npowered by Cactus Comments\n\n", "frontpage": false}
