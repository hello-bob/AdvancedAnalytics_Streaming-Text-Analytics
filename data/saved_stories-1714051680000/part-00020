However, if you know\nthe exact material density and elasticity, you can enter those parameters. >\nRead about cautions here\n\nCaution-> these values allow you to get close to the desired note (typically\nwithin 1%) but if you desire an exact note, cut slightly long and grind to the\nfinal length, but not usually required for wind chimes. Manufacturing\ndimensional tolerances may cause slight inaccuracies in the actual results,\nnot to mention the effects of poor material handling along with slight\nvariations in material properties and impurities. If in doubt, cut slightly\nlong and grind to final values. You can measure some of the frequencies (not\nall) for note verification using software programs listed here.\n\nMust Read Caution-> Do not use these calculations for an orchestra or a\nmusical setting unless you are certain they use A=440 Hz. An orchestra or\nsymphony may brighten slightly and will typically tune for A=442, 43 or 44 The\nabove chart uses A = 440 Hz. Most symphony grade instruments are shipped with\nA=442 Hz. While orchestra grade chimes typically do not go below the C5\noctave, they are not tuned for the fundamental frequency, which is the basis\nfor all the calculators on this website. Instead, they tune for the overtones\nand depend on the brain's fuzzy logic to perceive the correct note. An\norchestra chime that is tuned for C5 will typically be cut for a length around\nC2 and then hand tuned to become a perceived note of C5.\n\nChime calculator cell phone app by site visitor Andrew Hughes, Android Version\n\nOnline chime calculator by site visitor Larry Snyder - Suggests a 'cut list'\nand cost estimate for the number of raw tubes to be purchased. - Offers a\nSupport Disk pattern based on the number of chimes desired. - Allows for\nselecting various frequencies of \"A4.\" - Presents the Solfeggio \"Healing\"\nFrequencies. - Has macros for auto-selection of Major and Natural Minor\nscales. - Shows only the 'interesting stuff' when printed.\n\nTubes, Pipes or Rods\n\nWhat's the difference between a pipe and a tube; the way it\u2019s measured and the\nway is is applied for use. Pipes are passageways while tubes are for\nstructural builds like hand railing, bicycles and lawn chairs. For the purpose\nof tubular bell chimes we consider them the same. The important parameters are\nthe outside diameter, the inside diameter and the type of metal.\n\nOn the other hand, a rod is a solid metal cylinder that can produce a very\ndifferent sound compared to a tube. The DIY calculators on this website can\npredict the resonant frequency for a tube or a circular rod and their hang\npoint location. If you want to design and build a chime set using rods rather\nthan tubes all you have to do is set the inside diameter to zero and enter the\noutside diameter and type of metal into the DIY calculator.\n\nIf you are trying to decide between using a tube or a rod as the chime\nelement, one important difference is the sustain time of the musical note.\nTypically a rod will have a much longer sustain time and in some environments\nthis maybe desirable but annoying in others.\n\nAnother difference between tubes and rods is their length for a given note. A\nrod is shorter than a tube to strike the same note for the same metal. For\nexample, a 1 inch steel rod for middle C, (C4) is 26 1/4 inch while it is 32\n7/8 inch for a 1 inch steel EMT tube. In addition to smooth surface metal\nrods, I have tested steel rebar and the sound was awesome. Because of the\nhardness, rebar exhibited a wonderful sustain time which helped to hold on to\nthe overtones. I did not test the accuracy of the DIY calculator but I suspect\nit will be close. I would suggest selecting your notes based on steel, and\nwhile the notes probably will not be completely accurate, the ratio among the\nnotes should remain the same.\n\nTwo additional issues to consider are the weight and loudness difference. Rods\ntypically have a relative small diameter offering a smaller radiating surface\nproducing a quieter chime, but on occasion the longer sustain time can offset\nthe reduced loudness and sound quite acceptable.\n\nThe Build Plan\n\n1\\. Select the number of chimes (typically 3 to 10) for your set and the\nmusical notes. It is helpful to understand the limitations for effective note\nselection as discussed in the section on the bell-like chime. Keep in mind the\nphysical size for the set. Whether you use pre-calculated dimensions or a DIY\ncalculator, observe the length for the longest chime as a guide for overall\nsize. Remember to include extra length for the wind sail that hangs below the\nchimes. Read this caution.\n\n2\\. Select the metal for the chime tube. See the metals comparison in the\nvideo for How to Make Tubular Bell Wind Chime\n\n3\\. Cut each chime to the length provided by the pre-calculated table or the\nDIY calculator. Best to cut slightly long (about 1/8\u201d) to allow for smoothing\nand de-burring the ends to final dimensions.\n\nIf you're new to cutting metal and looking for an easy method, I use an\nabrasive metal cutting saw blade in a radial arm saw and it works equally well\nwith a cut-off saw aka chop-saw. The blade pictured right is under $5.00 at\nHome Depot. Make certain to use a cutting disk designed for the type of metal\nyou plan to use. Using the wrong type of abrasive disk can cause a dangerous\nexplosion The traditional tubing cutter or hacksaw also works well.\n\n4\\. Smooth the ends to remove sharp edges and to provide a professional\nappearance. Place an old towel or cloth on a table to protect the chime from\nscratches. Roll the chime back and forth as you file or sand the ends smooth.\nSlightly chamfer or round the outer edge.\n\n5\\. Drill the support holes at the hang-point location provided by the pre-\ncalculated table or the DIY calculator.\n\nUsing a V-block, center the block before drilling by lowering the drill bit to\nthe bottom of the vee and then clamp the block to the drill table.\n\nHow to drill the support holes without a drill press or V-block: Using card\nstock or a manila folder cut a strip about 1\u20442\u201d by 8\u201d or so, wrap it around\nthe tube and tape it so that you now have what looks like a \u201cCigar Band.\u201d\nRemove the band and lay it on a table. Flatten the band so a crease forms at\nboth ends. Example: say that the instructions ask for a hole 10 1\u20442 inches\nfrom the end of the tube. Slide the \u201cCreased Cigar Band\u201d down the tube to the\n10 1\u20442\u201d inch mark. Position one crease at your mark and then rotate the tube\nover to the second crease and mark that location. Now you have drilling marks\nexactly opposite each other.\n\n6\\. Deburr the support holes in preparation for your support line. Using a\ndrill bit larger than the hole, place the bit on the outside of the hole and\nrotate by hand. This is generally enough to chamfer the outside hole.\n\nOutside Before| Deburr| Outside After  \n---|---|---  \n  \nDeburr the inside support hole. First, using a round or half-round file,\nremove the burr from inside the tube. Finish the task by using a section of\ncoat hanger wire with a small bend approximately 105 degrees at the far end,\nas shown right. Place the wire in a drill and insert the bent end thru the\nhole. As you rotate the wire, lightly pull back on the drill and the bent wire\nwill bend over any inside burr.\n\nInside Before| Inside After  \n---|---  \n  \nThanks to Dennis Offner for a tip about deburring. An alternate approach for\ndeburring could be the deburring tools available from the Cogsdill Tool\nCompany. They manufactures several types of deburring tools that deburr the\noutside then collapse to pass through the hole and then expand to deburr the\nback side of the hole. Using an electric drill, a set of chime tubes can be\ndeburred in just a few minutes.\n\n7\\. Select the method or style for the top support disk or ring and the\nmaterial to be used.\n\nFor a long time, my favorite material has been treated lumber used for\ndecking, although it did need a weatherproofing sealer. Also, white, or red\ncedar works well coated with a weatherproof sealer. The engineered wood for\ndecks makes an excellent support plate and striker. If you know of someone\ninstalling a new deck using engineered wood, perhaps you can get a few scraps.\nOne board is expensive and may not be worth the cost, but scraps are useful.\nAlso, a half-inch thick nylon cutting board (old or new) works well. Some\npeople will shop flea markets for that special circular disk made of most\nanything from metal to plastic plates, etc. In addition, wandering the aisles\nof Home Depot, Lowe's, Target, Mendelssohn's and your local drugstore have\nproduced some surprising circular disk that can be drilled and are long\nlasting in the weather.\n\n8\\. Select the top support disk cutout pattern for your specific tubing size\nand number of chimes in the set. Download the support disk and striker\npatterns from the website and just print the page specific to your tubing size\nand number of chimes in the set. You may need to print two copies, one for the\nsupport pattern and hole locations, and one for the striker pattern. To assist\nthe wind striking all chimes use a fishing spinner for support. This allows\nthe wind to slightly rotate the chime set. (Thanks to Terry for the\nsuggestion.)\n\n9\\. Select either a circular striker, a radial star striker, or a striker-\nkeeper, all are included in the Wind Chime Support Disk and Striker Patterns\n\n10\\. Select and print a pattern for the wind sail from selections in Patterns\nfor Wind Sails/Catchers available on the website, or design your own design.\n\n11\\. Weather protect the top support disk or ring, the striker and the sail\nwith a UV protective finish. Decorate the chime tube as desired. A few\nsuggestions here.\n\n12\\. Select the line, cord or chain for supporting both the chime tube and the\ntop support disk.\n\n13\\. Select the style for hanging the chime tubes, i.e. top aligned, center\naligned or bottom aligned. Bottom aligned is best because it allows the\nstriker to easily contact the bottom edge of all chimes, the ideal strike\nlocation. Top aligned may have a more aesthetic appeal and on occasion some\nlike center alignment.\n\nAlso, you want to keep the distance between the chimes and the support desk\nquite short, no matter how they are aligned. This is to assist alignment\nduring high winds. If they dangle too far below to the support plate, they can\nbump into each other and occasionally get mixed up with each other. A few\ninches would be best.\n\n14\\. Select the sequence for locating the chimes on the support disk or ring.\n\n15\\. Attach the support line or chain to the chime using a simple jig you can\nmake. You can use an appropriately sized darning needle for threading line\nthrough the top support holes and tubes during assembly.\n\n16\\. In your workshop, temporally hang the support disk or ring just above eye\nlevel. Depending on your alignment selection (top, bottom or center) hang each\nchime according to both the alignment requirement and the chime sequence\ndiagram. Or you can use an alignment jig as described here.\n\n17\\. Hang the striker according to the alignment diagram and avoid striking\nexact dead center for any chime. All three locations work well when you keep\nthe striker away from the center dead zone for the first overtone. Don't worry\nabout killing the first overtone with center placement. The first overtone\ndead zone is very narrow and easily overcome with a slightly off-center\nstrike.\n\nResources\n\nMetal TubingMetal Tanks| Always try your local building supply store. In\naddition to visiting the hardware section in these stores investigate tubing\nused for closet hanging poles, shower curtain poles, chain link fence rails\nand post. Yard or garage sales can yield surprising results, look for a\ndiscarded metal swing set, tubular shelving, etc. With permission look for\ndiscarded materials on constructions sites. Try your local metal recycler;\nthey can yield very economical rod and tubing.Online sources:Amazon, eBay and\nthe like can surprise you at times, offering small orders at good\nprices.Speedy Metals accepts orders for small quantities of tubes or rods.\n(Aluminum, Brass, Cast Iron, Copper, Steel and Stainless)Online Metals: 1 inch\nOD x 0.125 inch wall x 0.75 inch ID Aluminum Round Tube 6063-T52-Extruded, 60\ninches long about $20/eachAmazon, set of five (5 pcs) aluminum tubes, 1 inch\ndiameter x 60 inches long with a wall thickness of 0.024 inch for $24.Amazon,\n11\u20444 inch diameter x 72 inch long x .057 inch wall thickness (1 pcs) bright\ndipped aluminum, about $31/eachTitanium Joe (Tubing) Titanium is a silver\ncolor, low density and high strength metal that is highly resistant to\ncorrosion in sea water, aqua regia and chlorine. You can use either grade 2\nbeing pure titanium, which is softer and less popular, or grade 9 (3AL-2.5V),\nwhich is the more popular high strength. The grade 9 numbers represent the\npercentage of Aluminum and Vanadium. The DIY Calculators work equally well for\nboth grades.Widener Metals is a small metals distributor supplying pipe,\ntubing and other misc. materials. Stocking stainless, aluminum and carbon\nsteel from 1/8 inch diameter up thru 12 inch diameter with various wall\nthickness' from very light to very heavy. No minimum orders, offering material\ncustom cut to length at no additional charge. 267-583-3772 or\ninfo@widenermetals.comTanks bells can be crafted from out-of-service\ncompressed gas/air tanks, scuba diving tanks or fire extinguishers. A most\nlikely source can be your local testing facility for each type of tank. Ask\nyour local fire department, welding shop and scuba diving shop for their\nrecommendation for a testing company. You may be required to provide a letter\nto the testing company stating that you will cut the tank in pieces and render\nit unable to hold compressed air or gas.  \n---|---  \nHoops & Rings| Try hobby stores for rings or hoops often used for dream\ncatchers, mandelas or macram\u00e9. Some are chrome plated steel and others may\nrequire paint. Support rings can be cut from an out of service aluminum fire\nextinguisher using an abrasive metal cutting saw blade in a radial arm saw, a\nchop saw or a table saw as described in step 3 above.  \nEyelets-Grommets| Small eyelets can often be located at your local hobby store\nin the sewing department, Joann Fabrics or a shoe repair store. You can also\nuse the outer shell of a 1/8 inch or 3/16 inch aluminum pop rivet. Remove the\nnail-like center and use the rivet. Heat shrink tubing can be found online at\nAmazon.  \nMetallic Support Line| Thin braided wire or 1/32 to 1/16 inch stainless steel\ncable, or decorative chain that is zinc plated, brass plated, or painted can\nbe located in hardware and home improvement stores. Try a hobby store for\nsmall aircraft control line cable.  \nNon Metallic Support Line| Make sure the line is UV resistant. Choices include\nfishing line (both 80 pound (35 Kg) braided or 30-50 pound (12-22 Kg)\nmonofilament), braided nylon line, braided plumb line, braided Dacron kite\nline, light weight string trimmer weed eater line (.065 inch), and braided\nelectrical conduit pull line.  \nStriker Material| A hockey puck, redwood, red cedar, red oak, treated lumber\nor a 1/4 inch nylon cutting board work well for large diameter chimes. Smaller\ndiameter, higher frequency chimes benefit from a harder wood such as white\noak, teak or Osage-orange (aka hedge-apple). Be sure to coat the striker with\na UV resistant coating.  \n  \nMusical Note Selection:\n\nA safe choice by many wind chime suppliers has been the pentatonic scale (C D\nE G A). An enhancement to that scale can be the C9 Chord (C E G B^b and D)\nwhich has a wider note separation for a good sound both close in and at a\ndistance from the chime. You can also select a chord to you liking to maximize\nthe useable tubing in standard hardware store lengths. See this website to\nview all the piano chords www.pianochord.org, Thanks to site visitor Lewis for\nthis suggestion.\n\nWith that in mind, we have DIY calculators for all musical notes or for\nspecific scales such as the pentatonic or the C9 Chord. You select the metal\nand the tubing size (ID and OD) and the calculator will provide the correct\nlength and hang point for each note. The longer the chime the lower the notes\nwill sound. So if a specific tuning like Westminster traditionally begins in\nthe C3 octave, like B3-E4-F#4-G#4, feel free to begin an octave lower, like\nC2, which would look like this, B2-E3-F#3-G#3.\n\nNote Selection Table  \n---  \nName| Notes| Number of Chimes  \nWestminster| B3 - E4 - F^#4 - G^#4| 4  \nPentatonic Scale| C - D - E - G - A| 5  \nC9 Chord| C - E - G - B^b - D| 5  \nHava Negila| C - D^b - E - F - G (opt A^b)| 5  \nCorinthian Bells Key of A| A - B - C^# - E - F^# - A| 6  \nCorinthian Bells Key of B| B - C^# - D^# - F - G^# - A^#| 6  \nCorinthian Bells Key of C| C - D - E - G - A - C| 6  \nCorinthian Bells Key of Eb| E^b - F - G - B^b - C - E^b| 6  \nCorinthian Bells Key of G| G - A - B - D - E - G| 6  \nCanterbury| D4 - E4 - F^#4 - G4 - A4 - B4| 6  \nTrinity| D4 - G4 - A4 - B4 - C5 - D5| 6  \nWinchester (or Wynchestre)| C4 - D4 - E4 - F4 - G4 - A4| 6  \nSt. Michael\u2019s| F4 - G4 - A4 - B^b4 - C5 - D5 - E5 - F5| 8  \nHappy Birthday| C5 - D - E - F - G - A - A^# - B^b - B - C6| 9  \n  \nWALKING or TRAVELING CHIMES Walking Chimes are chimes mounted on a stationary\nsupport, typically in a straight line, allowing the walker to strike each\nchime in sequence thus playing a song. Here is an example by Carol Raedy\n\nSpace the chimes so when the player walks at a steady pace it plays the song.\nEach word and dash represents a beat. You can use any length for the beat but\nit must be consistent. You could begin with one beat = 12 inches and modify\nfrom there.\n\nFor instance: \u201cJoy\u201d counts as one beat, so you will measure six lengths from\nwhere you hang the \u201cjoy\u201d bell (Joy plus five beats) and then hang the \u201cto\u201d\nbell. Measure one length from \u201cto\u201d to \u201cthe\u201d and from \u201cthe\u201d to \u201cworld\u201d since\nthere are no beat between these words. Measure eight lengths from \u201cworld\u201d to\n\u201call\u201d (world plus 7 more beats) and so. The beats at the end are only if you\nwant to make it in the round.\n\nSite visitor Carol Raedy graciously provided the following note patterns for\neach song.

An octave is from C to the key just prior\nto the next C, which would be B. Below is a graphical diagram that may help\nclarify this.\n\nAnother Must Read Caution-> Ending your project with a successful and pleasing\nsound is important and setting the right expectations will allow that to\nhappen. Selecting musical notes for a chime is NOT like selecting notes on a\npiano or other string instrument, or reed instrument. When you strike C2 on a\npiano that is indeed what you hear but Not true for a chime cut for C2.\n\nTuning implies exactness and exact tuning cannot happen when you do not hear\nthe fundamental note for the chime. When a piano key for C2 (65.4 Hz) is\nstruck, you will indeed hear that note, 65.4 Hz. When a C2 chime is struck you\nwill NOT hear 65.2 Hz. In fact. you will not hear the first overtone at 180 Hz\nand can barely hear the second overtone at 352 Hz. Most prominent will be the\nthird overtone at 582 Hz which, on a piano, sounds like D5, but is not D5\nbecause the mixing for all the overtones produces a completely new sound. The\nnew sound is melodious, it sounds wonderful, but what note is it?\n\nTuning charts on this site list dimensions for notes ranging from C1 to C9,\nthat imply exactness, which you now understand can not happen with a chime\nwhen you can't hear the fundamental note. Read more about the missing\nfundamental here. Why this happens is discussed in the section \"The Science of\nChiming\".\n\nFor example, an orchestra grade chime that is physically cut for C2 will\nactually sound about like C5. To see a visual representation for what a chime\nis apt to sound like, see this chart. On the other hand, will the strike note\nfor a chime sound pleasing and bell-like? Yes, absolutely, because of the\nlarge complement of overtones, even though the fundamental is missing.\n\nSelections from about C2 to C4 sound the most bell-like but will not\nadequately radiate the fundamental tone. Unfortunately this effect complicates\nnote selection if you are trying to strike exact notes lower than about C5.\nAbove C5 the strike note will actually be the fundamental and you can expect\nto hear the selected note, but less bell-like than the C2 to C4 range. In\nfact, for that reason, orchestra grade chimes typically only cover 1 1\u20442\noctaves beginning at C5 and extend to about G6.\n\nWind Chime Emulation Software Zip, 105 Kb Original Syntrillium program from\n1996 {Excellent} Help instructions are HERE\n\nThanks to a site visitor for providing this excellent emulation program from\n1996 by Syntrillium. They are now defunct and we believe the software is\nconsidered \"freeware\". The zip file contains the main program, the\nregistration codes and a help file. Unzip the download and run the\nwind_chimes_1.01_syntrillium.exe file. The program is quite intuitive, full\nfeatured and should be easy to operate. To begin I would suggest you set-up\nthe program as follows: Number of Chimes \"5\", Transpose to \"0\", Scale to \"New\nPentatonic\", Base Note \"C-4\", \"Center Pendulum\".\n\nRemember, the loudspeaker connected to your computer has the ability to play\nthe low notes from C2 to C4 but a chime may not radiate those sounds. The\nprogram was originally designed to run on DOS 6 using Windows 95, and runs\nwith Windows NT, W2000, W XP and W7 thru W10.\n\nChime Emulation Software by Greg Phillips. A well designed freeware called\nWind Chime Designer V2.0, 1997-2006-2020, will emulate a chime for notes\nbetween A2 (110 Hz) thru B8 (7,902 Hz) in 82 different scales. It will help\nyou determine what notes sound pleasant on a chime and what scale to use. If\nyour browser blocks his website try downloading if directly from HERE. (Zip\nfile)\n\nStrike a note or strike a chord? Over the years much effort by many well-\nintentioned people has been placed on exactly what is the best chord for a set\nof wind chimes? While a musical chord can be pleasing to the ear, the effort\nto simultaneously strike all the notes in a chord using the traditional\ncircular shaped striker/clapper has been a waste of time. The striker only\ncontacts one, maybe two chimes simultaneously.\n\nThis concept of sequencing and giving chime sets a name like Corinthian Bells,\nWinchester or Pentatonic is a marketing exercise to sell more chime sets. They\ndo not play in sequence and the listener will likely never identify what the\nrandom sounds from a chime set really represent. They're just notes. Selling\nchimes with an advertised famous sequence is marketing and advertising on\nsteroids, in my opinion.\n\nThe good news is that with some of our innovative striker designs we can now\nalmost strike a chord. More on this in the striker section.\n\nAlso, if you dedicate a striker to each chime tube (internal or external to\nthe chime) that configuration can ring several chimes at nearly the same time\nand approximate a chord. When using the traditional round striker it is much\nbetter to select notes that have a fair amount of separation allowing the ear\nto easily discern a variety of notes.\n\nOften a traditional choice has been the pentatonic scale (C D E G and A.) This\nchoice can sound pleasant close to the chime set but not so good at a\ndistance.\n\nThe C9 chord (C E G B^b and D) can be used to widen the note separations for a\nfive-chime set. The problem at a distance is the ear has difficulty discerning\nthe closely spaced notes of the pentatonic scale.\n\nCaution at a distance I often hear the comment, \"I have a set of chimes on my\ndeck and they sound great. However, I was over to my neighbor\u2019s the other day\nand the chimes did not sound so good. In fact, they sounded out of tune.\n\nWhy is this?\" The answer lies in the conditions that make up the notes for the\nchime. As mentioned in the science section, a chime note is a combination of\nthe fundamental strike frequency and the many overtones. Some of the overtones\nattenuate more rapidly than others at a distance. The original combination of\nstrike frequency and overtones are not the same at a distance.\n\nRemember, not always does the fundamental frequency contribute to the note and\nnot always are there many overtones for a given note. The actual note depends\non exactly where in the musical scale the chime is operating. When you have a\nchime that contains a larger number of overtones that are located in the\nhigher frequencies, and mostly missing the fundamental, you can get this\ndistance effect.\n\nHigh frequency sounds attenuate more quickly in the atmosphere than do the\nlower frequencies. At a distance you are not hearing the same sound you hear\nclose in. Some of the high frequency sounds can be greatly attenuated or\nmissing. The chime can sound completely different under these conditions.\n\nTypically this occurs when you select notes in the lower part of the scale. If\nyour interest is making the chimes sound good at a distance of say 80-100 feet\nor more, consider increasing the diameter of the tubing from the traditional\nsizes ranging from half inch thru two inches, up to at least 3 inch or more; 4\nto 6 inches are better.\n\nA set of chimes designed for the C2 to the C3 octave have good acoustic\nradiation properties close to the set but not so good far away because of this\ndistance effect. Additional information later on this page HERE.\n\nQuieting the chime set: Chimes can easily become annoying so maintaining a\nsubtle sound is important, particularly in high winds. Softening the striker\noften helps in addition the use of the keeper-striker. Typical striker\nmaterials are a rubber hockey puck or other soft rubber coverings found in the\nplumbing section of the local hardware store. Here are a couple examples.\n\nThe first example uses plastic aquarium tubing to cover the inside diameter of\nthe keeper striker.\n\nThe second uses a 3 inch and a 4 inch section cut from of a PVC plug. for 3 or\n4 inch PVC pipe.\n\nAnother solution from site visitor Troy, is to drill holes at the top and\nbottom nodes. Hang tubes so the bottom nodes line-up. Thread string through\nthe nodes with spacer between tubes. He used 4 mm poly garden water tubes he\nhad on hand. Other spacers and line would also work.\n\nAlso, you can thread a 50# monofilament fishing line or weed trimmer line\naround the outside tips of the star to keep the tubes from escaping and mixed\nup. Drill a small horizontal hole at the tips for the monofilament line.\n\nBuilding Big!\n\nWhether you want a set of large chimes used in the sound healing and therapy\narts, or you because of the anticipated lower frequency sounds, similar to a\nlarge diameter gong, or because you have a commission for an artistic display\nin a public location, building big may not accomplish all your goals.\n\nCertainly, a set of long, large diameter chimes as shown to the right (built\nby Chris from Wisconsin) will sound awesome, but a few words of caution before\nyou head in that direction. Since you read the caution statement above about\nthe missing fundamental and the issues with the small radiation surface area\nfor a chime tube, you can better understand how the insensitivity of the human\near at low frequencies contributes to our inability to adequately hear the low\nnotes, mostly below about C4.\n\nI am often contacted from the website when someone wants to Build Big. After\ncompletion of their large chime set they write to say, \"My new chime set\nsounds wonderful, but not as low as I expected.\"\n\nBeginning with the right expectations will help you move successfully along\nthe design path. Large diameter long chime sets are definitely worth the\neffort. Be mindful of annoying nearby neighbors since this sound travels far.\nBelow is an attempt to demonstrate loudness and note selection at a distance.\n\nChoice of Metal\n\nMost often the chime designer considers cost, weight and aesthetics. Your\nbudget may not approve the cost of copper and aluminum may be more favorable\nthan steel because of weight. Chimes from EMT (electrical conduit) are\ngalvanized and resist rust but not the support hole or the ends. Rust could be\nan issue long term for EMT. For the purposes of chime design use the steel\nselection in the calculator if you're EMT (thin wall conduit)..\n\nGood source for tubing: Speedy Metals by the inch and no minimums for\nAluminum, Brass, Copper, Cast Iron, Steel, and Stainless Steel, or Titanium\nJoe for titanium by the foot.\n\nWhat metal sounds best? After the issues above are considered we can move to\nthe question of what metal sounds best for a tubular chime? The short answer\nis the thicker the wall and the larger the diameter, the better they sound,\nnot necessarily the type of metal.\n\nHowever, what sounds best is a personal choice and I have not found a good\nanswer for everyone. Some like a deep rich sound and other like the tinkle\ntinkle sound.\n\nCopper chimes have a different timbre than steel chimes. The best I can advise\nis to visit a chime shop and test-drive a few chimes of different metals and\ndifferent sizes.\n\nWhen selecting tubing size and you're undecided between two sizes, select the\ntubing with more mass. More mass will produce a better sustain time. This\nselection may be the chime with a thicker wall or a larger diameter.\n\nOn small diameter chimes (about 1/2 to 1 1/4 inch) do not use tubing with an\nunusually thick wall. When the wall thickness is large compared to the\ndiameter, the extra stiffness can actually inhibit sustain time.\n\nAlways test the sound of tubing before deciding, particularly if you are\nevaluating several sizes. Support the tube at the 22.4% location using a\nstring, and strike with something like a heel of a hard rubber shoe or a wood\nmallet.\n\nYou may hear someone say they like aluminum best or copper best. To better\nunderstand the difference in metals let\u2019s build two 5-tube sets of chimes\nusing the C9 chord beginning with the C2 octave. One set from aluminum, 2\u201d OD\nwith a 1/8\u201d wall thickness, and the other set from steel, 2\u201d OD with a 1/8\u201d\nwall thickness. While each set will have different calculated lengths, they\nwill both strike the same fundamental note, but sound completely differently.\nWhy is that?\n\nContrary to intuition there are only two variables that control the sound of a\nchime, i.e. the density and elasticity of the metal. Those two variables\ncontrol the specific length dimensions to achieve a desired note for a given\ntubing size and wall thickness.\n\nFrom the chart below you can see that aluminum has the lowest density and the\nlowest modulus of elasticity (deforms easier than the others) , while copper\nhas the highest density but is only midrange for elasticity.\n\nWhat does all this have to do with what metal sounds best? The differences\namong metals cause a difference in timbre for the same note.\n\n| Modulus of Elasticity p.s.i.| Density Lbm / in^3  \n---|---  \nAluminum| 10,000,000| 0.0980  \nBrass| 17,000,000| 0.3080  \nCast Iron| 13,400,000| 0.2600  \nCopper| 16,000,000| 0.3226  \nSteel| 30,000,000| 0.2835  \nStainless Steel| 28,300,000| 0.2830  \nTitanium| 14,900,000| 0.1630  \n  \nOn occasion you may hear someone say they like aluminum chimes best. That\nlikely occurs because the lower modulus of elasticity for aluminum requires\nless strike energy for resonant activation and for a given input of strike\nenergy. The aluminum chime can be louder and have an increased sustain time.\nHowever, the difference among metals does not make one metal good and another\nbad. There are no bad sounding chimes when the notes are properly selected,\nteh tubes are properly tuned and properly mounted. It's impossible to have a\nset of chimes for the same note range made from aluminum sound the same as a\nset made from steel or any other metal, because of their difference in density\nand elasticity.\n\nIf you want the smallest possible chime set for a given note range use brass.\nOpposite to brass, EMT will provide the largest physical set for a given note\nrange. For example, see the table below organized smallest to largest for\nmiddle C (C4).\n\nLength for a one inch diameter chime at middle C (C4) , smallest to largest.  \n---  \nBrass .065 wall| Copper M| Cast Iron| Titanium .065 wall| Aluminum .065 wall|\nAluminum .035 wall| EMT  \n26 1/8 inch| 27 inch| 28 7/16 inch| 29 1/8 inch| 29 5/16 inch| 30 7/16 inch|\n32 7/8 inch  \n  \nQuality Caution: Not all tubing is created equal:\n\nBe aware that some tubing may produce a beating effect when struck (the wah-\nwah effect). Two closely spaced frequencies will interact to produce a third\nfrequency. This is often due to variations in the cross section of the tubing\ncaused by inconsistencies in the manufacturing process.\n\nThe elasticity and the density of the tubing will be different, depending on\nwhere the tube is struck. The tube can produce two closely spaced frequencies\nand these two frequencies will produce the beating effect.\n\nSome people enjoy this effect and others may find it annoying. If you want to\navoid this wah-wah effect, make sure you acquire high quality tubing \u2013 or test\na small piece before buying in bulk.\n\nWhile some tubing may be considered poor quality for musical requirements, it\ncan be excellent for structural needs. The problem with tubing that exhibits\nthis effect is that it makes precise tuning more difficult.. Listen HERE (mp3)\nto the beating sound for the tube shown to the right.\n\nIf you know the exact material density and modulus of elasticity, enter those\nparameters into the DIY Calculator on the data page, when using the DIY\ncalculator.\n\nI want to emphasize that good tuning will certainly help to accurately produce\nthe appropriate overtones for the selected note, particularly for the higher\nnote ranges.\n\nAbout Tubing Dimensions: Aluminum and brass tubing tend to exactly follow\ntheir stated ID and OD dimensions while copper tubing does not. Wall thickness\nfor copper pipe varies with the pipe schedule. The four common schedules are\nnamed K (thick-walled), L (medium-walled), M (thin-wall), and DWV\n(drain/waste/vent - non-pressurized). The printing on the pipe is color coded\nfor identification; K is Green, L is Blue, M is Red, and DWV is Yellow. Both\ntype M and type L copper can be found in the plumbing section of home\nimprovement stores like Menards^\u00ae, Home Depot^\u00ae, Lowe's^\u00ae and Ace Hardware^\u00ae.\n\nPre-calculated tube lengths for some common metals used in chimes are in the\ntable below.

The shorter the chime the more the tuning will change. For example,\nhere are the changes for a 5-chime set made from 2 inch OD aluminum with a\nwall of .115 inch. The set was originally cut for the pentatonic scale (CDEGA)\nbeginning at C6 using 90\u00b0 cut tubing. After a 45\u00b0 cut at the bottom end of\neach tube, the tuning increased from about 5% to 9% depending on length.\nUnfortunately, the rate of change was not linear, but a value specific to each\nlength of tubing. Tuning increase was C6 =+5.5%, D =+6.6%, E =+7.5%, G =+7.6%\nand A=+8.8%. Your notes may change more or less than these.\n\nAdditional testing was performed for a number of different diameters and\ndifferent lengths using aluminum, copper and steel tubing. The results were\nvery consistent. Short thin-walled tubing of any diameter changed the most and\nlong thick-walled tubing of any diameter changed the least. Short tubing\n(around 20 inches) could increase the tuning by as much as 9 to 10%. Long\ntubing (35 to 40 inches or more) could change as little as 2%. It was\nimpossible to predict the change other than the trend stated above for short\nvs. long. This was not surprising because shorting a tube will naturally\nincrease the note frequency.\n\nIf you want to maintain exact tuning using a 45\u00b0 cut, cut the tube longer than\nthe value suggested by the DIY calculator or the pre-calculated tables, and\ntrim to final value using your favorite tuning method. If exact tuning is not\nrequired or important, cut the tubing to the suggested length by the\ncalculator to pre-calculated chart, and trim the end at 45\u00b0.\n\nTuning the Chime\n\nIf you are attempting to create exact notes for an orchestra setting, exact\ntuning is required and the use of an electronic tuning device or a good tuning\near is necessary. On the other hand, if you desire a good sounding set of\nchimes but do not need orchestra accuracy, then carefully cut and finish to\nthe length suggested by the pre-calculated table or the DIY calculators listed\nabove.\n\nFrequency measurement: Measuring the exact frequency and musical note of the\nchime is challenging at best.\n\nRead the caution about chromatic tuners below!\n\nThere are a host of apps for Chromatic Tuners available for an iPhone, iPad or\nAndroid. Site visitor Mathew George uses \u201cgStrings\u201d on his Android, pictured\nright.\n\nI use the $.99 app \u201cinsTuner\u201d on an iPad that includes an FFT spectrum\nanalyzer in addition to freeware Audacity\u00ae on a Laptop described below.. A few\nscrap pieces of wood to make two U-brackets, rubber bands and you're in\nbusiness. Mark the support nodes 22.4% from each end for locating the rubber\nbands.\n\nIf you have just a few measurements to make, a quick and easy support\nsuggestion is a string with slipknot positioned at the 22.4% node, pictured\nabove with the iPad.\n\nCaution-> It can be challenging and often impossible for a chromatic tuner to\nmeasure a chime note correctly. Non linearity of the human ear and a chime's\nnon-harmonic overtones are two reasons.\n\nChromatic tuners listen and display sound as it is being produced on a linear\nbasis for both amplitude and frequency, but our brain process the same\ninformation using fuzzy logic. Why is this a problem?\n\nUnfortunately, the human ear is no doubt the most non-linear and narrowband\nsound listening device we know of. Similar to other percussion instruments,\nchimes do not produce fundamental frequencies and pure harmonic frequencies\nlike string instruments, wind tubes and reed instruments, for which chromatic\ntuners are intended.\n\nInstead, there are numerous non-harmonic overtones present which (depending on\ntheir individual frequency and amplitude) can be predominant to a tuner or\nanalyzer, but make little or no difference to the human ear. A chromatic tuner\nmay display the predominant amplitude and frequency, but that may not be what\nthe ear actually perceives. Because of the brain's \"fuzzy logic\"\ncharacteristic, the many overtones associated with a particular chime\nfundamental frequency, combine to produce a musical note the brain recognizes,\nbut may not be recognized by a chromatic tuner.\n\nIt is difficult to provide an exact recommendation when to use the tuner to\nmeasure a chime's note, but in general, I find most any note below C4\ndifficult to measure and on occasion below C5. Long, low frequencies tubes,\nmostly measure incorrectly because of the \"missing fundamental effect\" and the\npreponderance of high amplitude overtones. Thick-walled tank chimes/bells can\nmeasure with surprising accuracy because of a single pure tone above C4 that\nis not cluttered with unimportant sidebands. However, thin-walled tank\nchimes/bells seem not to do as well and they may be impossible to measure\naccurately.\n\nIn addition, poor quality tubing exhibiting dual fundamentals, will cause the\nchromatic tuner to constantly switch between the two fundamentals, both of\nwhich are incorrect. If you are not displaying the note you expected, try\nmoving the chime further away from the tuner to help minimize unimportant\nfrequencies.\n\nIf you get a good steady reading that is not what you expected, the tuner is\nlistening to a predominant overtone, so just ignore that measurement. Using\nthe values for length provided by the tables and DIY calculators on this page\nwill get you very close to the exact note. If the tuner cannot make a\nbelievable measurement, use the calculated length for the chime.\n\nA good software solution for FFT spectrum analysis measurement is the freeware\nprogram Audacity\u00ae used on a Laptop pictured to the left-hand side.\n\nA few additional software sources are listed below. Most any computer\nmicrophone will work. In fact, I have used the microphone on a headset.\n\nTo eliminate the annoying background noise when using a microphone, use an\naccelerometer. I have good success supporting the chime horizontally at one\nnode by a rubber band and at the other node by a thin wire looped around the\nchime and attached to an accelerometer.\n\nAudacity\u00ae Laptop freeware, open source, cross-platform software for recording\nand editing sounds.

At a cost, available for the iPhone, iPad and iPod\nTouch, Windows laptops, Windows Mobile Pocket PCs, Smartphones, and the\nAndroid.\n\nMechanical Support :\n\nThe ideal chime support location to allow for a lengthy sustain time is\npositioned at either of two locations; at the fundamental frequency node\nlocated 22.42% from either end, or at the very end using a string or cable\nthreaded through an end cap.\n\nIf sustain time is not a requirement (which makes a tubular chime, a bell\nsounding chime) such as for orchestra chimes pictured to the right, then\nsupport can be through horizontal holes near the end of the tube. A chime\nsupported in this manner reduces most of the sustain time. I do NOT recommend\nthis method of support to achieve a great sounding set of chimes.\n\nYou may see commercial wind chimes supported in this manner, but they cannot\nsupport the tradition bell-like sound that you may be expecting. Incorrect\nsupport ranks as the number one mistake made by some commercial chimes sets on\nthe internet and in stores. They will produce a strike note but lack the rich\nresonant bell-like sound that results from proper support.\n\nThe first support method for a bell-like sustain time uses the traditional\nfundamental frequency node which is 22.42% from either end. See the Transverse\nvibration mode diagram at the right. An important objective for a bell-like\nchime is to preserve the resonance of the chime as long as possible.\n\nAccurate placement for the support holes helps to assure the high quality (Q)\nor hang-time or sustain time for the chime. A hole size of 1/16 inch can be\ndrilled directly on the location mark but for larger holes, try to place the\ntop of the hole so it aligns with the location mark. If you're curious about\nother support locations, it is possible to support the chime at the first,\nsecond or third overtone node, but not recommended.\n\nAll charts and calculations on this page are for the support line to be\nlocated at the fundamental frequency node which is 22.42 % from either end and\nis the optimum location. If you happen to have a background in both mechanical\nvibration and acoustic vibration, it is easy to confuse overtones and\nharmonics. Overtones = Harmonics -1, or Harmonics = Overtones + 1.\n\nThis acoustic harmonic relationship has no connection to the radio frequency\ndefinition of harmonics.\n\nWhile making this nice steel 10-chime set, site visitor David, made a good\nvideo demonstrating how to locate the hang-point node using the chime's\nnatural vibration nodes and a small pile of sand. See his video here\nwww.youtu.be/e7o7hf1AOl4\n\n1^st Fundamental Frequency| 1^st Overtone, 2^nd Harmonic| 2^nd Overtone, 3^rd\nHarmonic  \n---|---|---  \nAnimations courtesy of Dr. Daniel A.

Remove the wire arms from the clip, stretch them out a little,\nand position in place using needle nose pliers, wiggle the arm until the tips\npop out of the holes. Be sure to attach your hanger line first. The arms tend\nto be self centering. The binder clips are available in different sizes so you\ncan match the clip to the diameter of the pipe. The wire diameter increases\nwith the size of the clip so make sure to check before you drill the pipes.\n(Submitted by site visitor Tom, Thanks)\n\nAnother option is the stainless-steel butterfly V-clip used in pool poles and\ntent poles as shown here. There are plastic versions and stainless-steel\nversions, both are on Amazon. Search for keywords ( Kayak Paddle Spring Clips\nTent Pole Clips Push Button Spring Snap Clip Locking Tube Pin). The stainless-\nsteel clip can be made to work on tubing sizes up to a 2-inch diameter. Not\nsure how small a diameter tubing will work but I suspect 3\u20444 inch might be the\nsmallest. Submitted by site visitor Ed. Thanks Ed!\n\nAnother alternate support was submitted by Bud (Thanks): I place a copper wire\ninto a copper pipe and threaded it thru one of the hanging holes, then solder\nit to the pipe (then cut and grind the excess flat with the tube), and the\nsame for the other hanging hole. Now I have 2 copper wires coming out the\ninside top of the pipe. I chuck them up to a drill motor and twist, being\ncareful not to kink the wire. Twisting will center the wires in the tube and\nleave a good looking single wire coming out the center of the pipe. This also\nwould work with steel tubing. This seems to work okay and it looks cool with\nthe twisted wire.\n\nEnd Cap, the second support location is when the chime tube is supported by a\ncable or cord through a hole in an end cap.\n\nIt is important to understand that the end cap lowers the fundamental\nfrequency and some associated overtones from values calculated by the DIY\ncalculator or Pre-calculated charts. For 1/2 inch copper tubing type L, the\nfundamental is lowered by about 3% to 6% from calculated values on this page.\nFor 3/4 inch type L copper tubing the fundamental is lowered by about 11% to\n12%.\n\nThe good news is that the end cap noticeably increases the duration for the\nfirst overtone and the chime has a much more bell-like sound. Look at these\ntwo spectral waterfall displays and specifically compare the hang time of the\n1st overtone for each. You will notice a considerable increase in sustain time\nfor the end cap supported tube.\n\nCaution-> be certain to solder the end caps in place. An unsoldered or loose\nfitting end cap will completely kill the resonance. An end cap must contact\nthe entire circumference at the end of the chime to function properly.\n\nWaterfall display for a chime tube supported by a hole in the end cap. Similar\nto the traditional orchestra chime| Waterfall display for a chime tube\nsupported at the traditional fundamental frequency node.| End Cap Support 1/2\ninch Type M Copper Tubing  \n---|---|---  \n  \nEnd support for Rods: It is possible to support a rod at the end. You might be\ntempted to inset a screw eye at the end, but I can assure you that will\ncompletely kill the resonance. Resonance for a tube or rod can easily be\nkilled by touching the end. The end cap is a special case that allows\nresonance to exist without seriously reducing the sustain time. But adding a\nscrew eye or any amount of mass to the end can kill the sustain time for a\nrod. The easy solution that works very well is to drill a small hole in the\nend of the rod and epoxy a 50 pound (22 Kg) woven fishing line into the hole.\nFirst tie a knot at the end prior to inserting the line into the hole. This\nlow mass and flexible connection do not impact the resonance and provides an\neasy method for connection.\n\nPlayground Chimes Support: Pictured right is a set of playground chimes for a\nfull octave (CDEFGABC) from anodized aluminum that was displayed on the\nwebsite External Works.\n\nThis fun and easy DIY project has a couple of important requirements.\n\nFirst, mounting follows the same requirement as above, i.e. locate the support\nholes 22.4% from both ends. Rubber grommets help to minimize the reduction of\nsustain time caused by a firm mounting, but are not absolutely necessary for\nthis application.\n\nRubber has a tendency to deteriorate over time and the use of a nylon or\nplastic sleeve would be a good alternate.\n\nFirm and strong mounting is definitely a requirement for the playground\nenvironment, but we need to prevent squeezing the tube at the mounting\nlocation. Careful adjustment, when tightening bolts, can prevent this squeeze.\n\nKeep the mounting somewhat firm to prevent the undesirable BUZZ caused by\nloose mounting. Flexible grommets allow a firm mounting that will prevent the\nbuzz.\n\nA better arrangement is to insert the the bolt into one side of the chime, no\nall the way through. This prevents squeezing the chime while maintaining a\nfirm mount to withstand playground play.\n\nSupport Line:\n\nKeep the distance between the chimes and the support disk short no matter how\nthey are aligned. This is to assist alignment during high winds. If they\ndangle too far below to the support disk, they can bump into each other and\noccasionally get mixed up. A few inches would be best.\n\nLongevity for a chime is important and careful attention to the support lines\nand thru holes should be considered. Rapid wind changes and UV light can\nquickly deteriorate support lines, not to mention the many freeze/thaw cycles.\n\nNon metallic support line: Make sure the line is UV resistant. Choices include\nfishing line (either 80 pound braided or 30-50 pound monofilament), braided\nnylon line, braided plumb line, braided Dacron kite line, string trimmer/weed\neater line (.065 inch), awning cord, and braided electrical conduit pull line.\n\nMetallic support line: thin wire, decorative chain (zinc plated, brass plated,\nor painted), 1/32 or /16 inch stainless steel cable (rust resistant), small\naircraft control line cable.\n\nDe-burring: depending on where the support line exits the chime, from the\ninside or outside, one or the other sharp edges of the thru hole require de-\nburring. An easy method to de-burr the outside edges of the thru hole is to\nuse a larger drill bit to slightly chamfer the outer edges. If the inside edge\nof the thru hole is of concern, first remove the burr using a long round file\nor sandpaper on a stick.\n\nBy hand, insert the smooth shaft end of the drill bit or other hardened steel\nrod into the hole and rotate in a circular motion, careful not to break the\ndrill bit. This motion will tend to further chamfer the outside edge and help\nto burnish the inner edge of the hole.\n\nGrommets/Eyelets: are mostly for protecting the outside edge of the thru hole.\nRubber, plastic or metal (grommets or eyelets) are encouraged, but small sizes\ncan be a challenge to locate. Small eyelets can often be located at your local\nhobby store in the sewing department or at shoe repair store. You can also use\nthe outer shell of an 1/8 inch or 3/16 inch aluminum pop rivet. Remove the\nnail-like center and just use the rivet.\n\nSources: include Home Depot or Lowes for heat shrink tubing, eyelets from the\nhobby store in the sewing department or a shoe repair store. Grommets can be\nfrom a hardware store, the model airplane store or the hobby store.\n\nThe knot in the support line or wire can be mostly hidden by use of a\ncountersink hole when using thru holes to anchor the line to the support disk.\nPictured below are a few examples for anchoring the line.\n\nJigs to position the chime for attaching support line or chain: After you have\nselected the alignment configuration, top, center or bottom, a simple jig can\nassist the installation of the support line. To the right are three possible\njigs, a square-grove jig and a v-grove jig, both with red adjustable stops for\nalignment. A third jig made from a section of cardboard or wood strip can work\nwell. Scribe a mark for the bottom, center, or top alignment on the jig. Begin\nwith the longest chime and select an appropriate length for the attachment\nline from the chime to the support point on the support disk or ring and\nlocate a nail, a pencil mark, or the adjustable post at that location on the\njig. Place the longest chime on the template and secure with tape, a clamp or\nmaybe lay a book on it. Stretch the line up to the reference post and tie a\nloop or a knot or mark with a felt tip pen. Repeat with the remainder of the\nchime set using the scribed reference mark. For center aligned chimes attach a\nsmall section of masking tape to the center of the chime and scribe the chime\ncenter location on the tape.\n\n| Support Line Suggestions  \n---  \nDeburr inside hole using stick and sandpaper.| Chamfer outside hole using an\noversized drill bit.| 1/8 inch and 3/16 inch aluminum eyelets and a pop\nrivet.| Outside hole with aluminum eyelet.| Eyelets do not protect the line\nfrom the inside edge.  \n1/8 inch and 3/16 inch eyelets using the top hat from a pop rivet.

Generic layout\npatterns are also included\n\nSupport disk calculator with points on a circle Calculator included (Zip) 220\nKb\n\nYou may wish to calculate you own dimensions for the top support disk using\nthe support disk calculator. You decide the chime diameter (CD), the striker\nradius (SR) and the clearance between the striker and the chime tube (D). The\ncalculator provides the correct location for placing the chimes on radius (R)\nand the spacing between the chimes (C2C), and the diameter of the support disk\n(TSDR). Locations (S) are the points for the support line. Instructions for\nuse are included with the calculator.\n\nAlso included is a location calculator for points on a circle. Uses include\nautomatic calculations for locating chimes on a radius, and points used to\ndraw a multisided polygon such as a star striker or support disk arranged as a\nstar, a pentagon, a hexagon or an octagon etc. An easy lookup table is\nprovided for locating 3 to 8 points.\n\nRather than using a protractor to layout the angles for the shape of your\npolygon, select the number of points and the radius (R) for those points, and\nthe calculator provides you with the distance between points. Adjust a compass\nto the distance (L) and walk the compass around the circle to locate the\npoints.\n\nIf you want to avoid using the above calculator, an easy work-around is to\nselect an appropriate generic pattern from the Support disk and striker\npatterns document and scribe the accurate location for support holes using the\npattern.\n\nChime Location Sequence\n\nSuggested locations for a circular chime configurationA circular striker will\ntypically strike one chime at a time but can simultaneously strike two chimes.\nWhen this happens you can enhance the overall sound by placing widely\nseparated notes next to each other For example, below are location suggestions\nwith chime number 1 as the shortest and moving upwards in length as the\nlocation numbers increase.  \n---  \nInline configuration  \n1 - 3 - 5 - 2 - 4| 1 - 4 - 2 - 5 - 3 - 6| 1 - 5 - 2 - 6 -3 - 7 - 4| 1 - 5 - 2\n- 6 -3 - 7 - 4 - 8  \n| Chime-Set Support Suggestions To assist the wind striking all chimes use a\nfishing spinner for support.

A rawhide-\ncovered baseball or softball can work well for wind chimes, but only in an\nextremely high wind environment where there is ample strike energy from the\nsail. An orchestra chime is struck with gusto, but a wind chime often has\nlittle strike energy. Typically there is little strike energy from normal\nwinds so preserving and applying that energy is the challenge. Design\nconsiderations below include single or multiple strikers, the shape, weight,\nmaterial, suspension, motion, and strike location.\n\nAn important consideration for a bell-like chime is the location for the\nStrike Zone. The optimum location is at the very end of the tubular chime\nbecause this location will assure that all possible overtones are energized to\nthe maximum. This should not be surprising since orchestra chimes are struck\nat the end.\n\nAn easy solution to assuring the strike occurs at the very end of the chime is\nto use bottom alignment and a tapered striker as shown in striker suggestions.\n\nOften you will see the center selected as the strike location for a tubular\nbell wind chime, perhaps for aesthetic reasons. When the exact center of the\nchime is struck the odd numbered overtones can fail to energize, and the\nresulting sound can be very clunky even though the even numbered overtones\nwere well energized.\n\nWhile I recommend striking the end of the chime, there are good aesthetic\nreasons to align the chimes for a center alignment or a top alignment. The\nideal strike zone is about 1 inch from the end, or about an inch below the\ncenter, line as pictured below. All three locations work okay when you keep\nthe striker away from dead center, which is a dead zone for the first\novertone.\n\nDon't worry much about killing the first overtone with center placement. The\nfirst overtone dead zone is very narrow and easily overcome with a slightly\noff-center strike.\n\nStrike zone for top, bottom or center alignment.  \n---  \nTop Aligned Find the center line for the longest chime and position the\nstriker at least an inch or more below that center line. Anywhere in the green\nsection above.| Bottom Aligned Find the center line for the shortest chime and\nposition the striker at least an inch or more below that center line. Anywhere\nin the green section above.| Center Aligned Find the center line for all\nchimes and position the striker at least an inch or more below the center\nline. Anywhere in the green section above.  \n  \nThe Striker Shape is most often circular because the chimes are located in\ncircle. An alternate shape is the circular traveling radial striker which can\nbe effective for striking a musical chord.\n\nThe radial striker most often takes the shape of an open star or a closed\nstar, like the keeper-striker pictured here. The striker has a tendency to\nrotate CW and CCW as it bounces to and from each chime.\n\nA circular striker will typically contact one or maybe two chimes\nsimultaneously. However, the star shaped striker can synchronously contact\nmost all the chimes. The loudness of the chimes struck with a star striker is\nsomewhat reduced compared to the circular striker because the strike energy\nhas been distributed among the various chimes.\n\nTransparent Closed Star Keeper-Striker: Site visitor and chime set builder,\nDennis Wagner, devised a nifty method to gain the advantage of a keeper-\nstriker, yet maintain a clean and transparent look.\n\nDennis drilled 3/64 inch holes at the star tips and threaded 50# test\nmonofilament fishing line (1/32 inch) thru each hole to form a firm but\ntransparent circular keeper.\n\nStriker Weight: A heavy striker for large chimes and a lighter weight striker\nfor smaller chimes, is mostly true. Depending on your typical wind there may\nbe occasions when you need a light weight striker for large chimes.\n\nNear the seashore, winds can be rather strong and you may need to soften the\nstrike with a light weight striker or switch to a rawhide-covered baseball or\nsoftball. Considerable strike energy can be achieved by using an oak disk\nmachined to a knife-edge and loaded with a 1oz weight. See striker suggestions\nbelow.\n\nStriker Distance from Chimes: It is difficult to predict the optimum distance\nfrom the edge of the striker to the chime for a new design and often requires\nexperimentation. Additional factors effecting overall performance are striker\nweight, wind sail size, sail weight and average wind conditions in the area.\n\nI generally begin with a 1-inch separation and begin testing. Then maybe\nchange the separation and/or the sail size.\n\nDon't hesitate to abandon your original striker or sail and try a different\nseparation or a different wind sail.\n\nYour effort will be rewarded when you hit that magic combination. Often, I\nwill try about three strikers and two or three sails before finding the\nperfect combination.\n\nStriker Material: The choice of material depends somewhat on the note\nselection. If there is good movement from the wind sail, then a circular disk\nstriker (soft sided but heavy) can be used for the larger diameter chimes (say\nabove 2 inches), particularly for lower frequency chimes. Some choices are a\nhockey puck, redwood, red cedar, treated lumber or a 1/4 inch nylon cutting\nboard.\n\nBullet Nose Edge: If you want a rounded over edge for the circular wood\nstriker and don't have access to a router then you can easily accomplish that\ntask with a drill press or hand drill. Mount the striker in a drill press via\na center bolt and then spin it at a high speed to sand it round and round over\nthe edge. You could use a hand drill but it's a little more awkward.\n\nNote: when drilling a center hole in the hockey puck, the drill bit wants to\ngrab and force its way through the rubber and may drill off-center. My\nexperience is to slow down the drill and secure the puck to a surface so it\ncan\u2019t move, then drill very slowly. A drill press woks best but again, secure\nthe puck.\n\nIf the wind is quite strong and gusty, you may need to soften the striker even\nfurther by using a rawhide-covered baseball/softball. The rawhide helps to\nproduce a very mellow strike in a strong wind. Smaller diameter higher\nfrequency chimes benefit from a harder wood like white oak, teak or Osage-\norange aka hedge-apple. Be sure to coat the striker with a UV resistant\ncoating.\n\nOn the other hand, a well performing star-striker should be from a relatively\nhard material, yet light weight, allowing for a quick response to circular\nmovements.\n\nThe loudness of chimes struck with a star striker is reduced, compared to the\ncircular striker, because the strike energy has been distributed among the\nvarious chimes, and a harder material is required for a strong strike. 1/8\ninch soft aluminum, sheet plastic or a 1/4 inch nylon cutting board works well\nto accomplish both goals.\n\nKeep it Clean: A dirty strike can energize a host of unwanted spurious\nsideband frequencies as demonstrated by the steel striker in the blue spectrum\ndisplay below. A most melodious bell sound is achieved with a softer strike\nthat energizes overtones without spurious sidebands, as shown in the purple\nspectrum display below.\n\nBoth strikers produced equal loudness for the fundamental while the steel\nstriker did a better job of energizing overtones (louder) but at the expense\nof unwanted dirty sidebands. The wood striker (hard maple) produced a most\nmelodious bell sound while the metal strike was harsh and annoying.\n\nThe Conceal and Carry Chime hides a lead or steel striker on the inside the\nchime for large diameters chimes, mostly above two inches as pictured left and\nright.\n\nThis technique is seldom used unless the chime set is large or becomes\nannoying, caused by the traditional disk striker in high winds. Because the\ndistance is insufficient for the striker to gain momentum and strike with\ngusto, the inside striker could be a good solution to quieting chimes in high\nwinds.\n\nIf you're looking for a muted sound from a large set, maybe 4 inches and\nabove, this technique is useful. The striker can be a steel ball or a lead\nweight, normally used as a sinker for fishing, and can be any of the\nfollowing: a cannon ball sinker, a bell sinker, a bank sinker or an egg\nsinker.\n\nWrap the sinker with about two layers of black electrical tape to prevent the\nharsh sound from a metal strike yet still provide a strong but muted strike.\nSupport for the striker string or line from can be from the same point you use\nto support the chime tube.\n\nStriker Motion: I happen to live in a wooded area with little wind and have\nstruggled to achieve good strike energy from low winds. With that in mind, I\nset out to improve the low wind performance of the striker.\n\nThe objective is to maximize striker movement with little input energy from\nthe sail. The easy solution was to resonant the support line that supports\nboth the striker and the sail using the second mode bending principle.\n\nThis resonance will help to amplify and sustain the motion of the striker with\nlittle input energy from the sail. Even though the sail moves in the wind, it\nwill act as an anchor for the resonant movement of the striker.\n\nYou can easily recognize this movement by using both hands to hold a string\nvertically and have a second person pluck the center of the string. The\nnatural resonance of the string will cause the center to vibrate. If you\nposition the striker at the exact center between the top and the sail you can\nachieve this resonance.\n\nIt is difficult to provide an exact ratio between the weight of the striker\nand the weight of the sail. Depending on the actual weight for both the ratios\ncan be quite different. In general, when you attempt to resonant the striker\nline, I suggest the striker not exceed the weight of the sail and ideally the\nstriker should be about 1/2 the weight of the sail.\n\nI realize that if you use a CD as the sail, a lighter weight striker can be\ndifficult to achieve. A heavy striker is difficult to resonant regardless of\nthe weight for the sail.\n\nOnce you have a striker you like then a little experimenting with the sail\nmaybe required to achieve good resonance. On the other hand, for medium to\nhigh winds and for a non-resonant mounting, the wind catcher/sail should have\na weight less than 25% of the striker. When resonance is working well you will\nnotice as the sail comes to rest, the striker will continue to bounce off the\nchimes for a few more strikes, an indication the striker is dissipating the\nstored energy from resonance.\n\nSee this Resonant Striker VIDEO WMV, for a demo. Notice the large movement of\nthe striker compared with little movement from the sail.\n\nWind Chime Striker/Clapper Suggestions (Best to always include an axle.)\n\nStriker Suspension: A small 1/16-inch brass tube about 5 inches long thru the\ncenter of the striker allows for the suspension line to be threaded and used\nas an axle for the disk. This helps keep the disk horizontal during rapid and\nsudden movements from high winds. A stiff wire, like coat hanger wire, can be\nused as an axle as shown below in striker suggestions. Site visitor Rickey\nAbsher purchased small aluminum tubing from Amazon. There was sufficient\ntubing to make four axels. See picture for details.\n\nStriker Suggestion: a turnbuckle is often used to support the top support disk\nand as an axle for the striker. Over time the turnbuckle can become unscrewed\nfrom wind movement. Place a locking substance on the threads to prevent\ntwisting, such as Loctite or equivalent.\n\nThanks to a site visitor who used lamp repair pipe nipples into a 3/8\" hole\nwith lamp hoops to hold the hanger support and the clapper/striker.

Traditional wind sails work well and can be\nconfigured with a variety of materials, sizes and shapes as shown in the\ndocument on the right.\n\nPatterns for Wind Sails/Catchers 1.5 Meg, PDF\n\nDissatisfaction with the traditional wind sails is a single-direction wind has\na tendency to cause the sail to swing like a pendulum. That arrangement will\nswing the sail both to and from the direction of the wind, not allowing the\nstriker to contact adjacent chimes. That affect sounds much like a dingdo as\nthe striker hits only two chimes.\n\nAs you may know, wind close to the ground can behave differently than winds\naloft, and often does not blow horizontally as intuition would suggest.\nInstead, it is a multidirectional force with an ample amount of wind shear.\n\nTo better understand wind turbulence mixed with single-direction winds watch\nthis 60 second video,\n\nBi-Directional Wind Vane VIDEO (WMV, 3.2Meg) showing a bi-directional wind\nvane mounted on my deck. You probably noticed the swirling motion mixed with\nsingle-direction winds and the random uphill and downhill movement (pitch and\nyaw). Perhaps we can exploit this force to make a better wind sail. Let's take\nadvantage of this turbulence to create a striker movement that is somewhat\nrotational in nature and does a better job of striking all the chimes.\n\nIf you want to build a bi-directional wind vane here is a concept drawing\ndisplayed in 3D-PDF.\n\nThe metal components are soldered together and the vertical support post is\nrounded at the top. I used thin sheet aluminum for the tail and 1/4 inch\ncopper tubing for the vertical support sleeve and the horizontal pivoting\nsleeve. The horizontal rod is 1/4 inch and Gorilla Glue is used to bond the\nparts not held with solder.\n\nSee video here 1.5 Meg WMV\n\nSolving the Dingdong\n\nThe first of several solutions to better capture wind turbulence can be quite\nsimple. Mount the sail at 45\u00b0 to the horizontal so as to catch the pitch and\nyaw forces, as pictured on the right. Thread the support line through two\nsmall holes next to the center of an old CD disk and tie the knot slightly\noff-center to create the 45\u00b0 slope. You may need to glue the line in place for\nthe long term.\n\nA second solution is to hang the sail perfectly horizontal. Counter intuitive,\nI agree, but depending on your particular type of wind it can work surprising\nwell, particularly if the chime set is hung from a high deck or beyond the\nfirst story of the building and the wind is particularly turbulent.\n\nSite visitor (David) writes to offer an alternate method for tilting the sail.\nPlace the support line in the hole of the CD and tie to the line an object\nlarger than the hole such as a shot piece of dowel rod or colorful section of\ncloth. Now you have a tilted sail and a sun sail, all-in-one. See picture at\nleft. Thanks David.\n\nA third solution is to make sure the top support disk can easily rotate in a\ncircular direction. Hang the top support disk not from a fixed ring or hook\nbut from a single support line as pictured to the right. The very nature of\nthe wind will catch enough of the chimes to rotate the entire set allowing the\npendulum motion of the sail to strike more of the chimes.\n\nA fourth solution can be the radial traveling star striker described above.\nThe very nature of the star striker is to quickly rotate CW and CCW from any\ninput motion of the sail, even from straight line winds, and this motion will\neasily avoid the dingdong sound.\n\nNeed More Dingdong? At this point you are most likely saying \u201cWHAT\u201d more\ndingdong? We just got done solving the dingdong and now you want more!\n\nYes, there is a condition when excessive pendulum movement of the sail is\nuseful and not sufficiently supplied by the tradition wind sail. With the\ndevelopment of the keeper-striker or the radial-striker, both of which are\nvery effective in striking a musical chord, there is a need for a robust\nmovement of the striker.\n\nThe radial striker produces a more muted sound because the strike energy is\nsimultaneously distributed among all the chimes by moving in a circular\nmotion. Thus the need for a more robust strike.\n\nJerk, Jolt, Surge and Lurch: We often describe the motion of an object in\nterms of displacement, velocity, or acceleration. However, an additional\nmotion description is the rate of change of acceleration, although seldom\nused. The unit of measurement is often termed jerk but is also known as jolt,\nsurge, or lurch . Jerk supplies the sudden and rapid motion from the wind sail\nto the rotary keeper-striker.\n\nIntroducing Orthogonal Sailing: We have developed a special wind sail to solve\nthe need for more jerk. As mention above, a normal wind sail will mostly swing\nto and from the direction of the wind; however, the orthogonal sail has the\nunique ability to fly aggressively at right angles to the wind direction. If\nthe wind is from the North the sail will fly East and West.\n\nConstruction details are in the Handbook and available here. See the video\nbelow for the Orthogonal Wind Sail in action.\n\nCAUTION-> The orthogonal sail can be dangerous.We do not recommend hanging the\nchime set where the sail can contact children, adults, or animals. The sail\nmakes no noise and can swing a full 180 degrees in a half circle motion.This\nquiet operation and wide swing can cause people to be unaware of the danger.\nThe sail is flat thin metal and can possibly cut the skin or damage an eye as\nit swings. BE CAREFUL !  \n---  \n  \nNo Sailing Today: Long and large diameter chimes present a considerable\nsurface area to the wind and can move sufficiently to cause a good strike\nwithout the need for a wind sail. In addition, the large diameter striker,\noften associated with a large chime set, can capture adequate wind for a good\nstrike.\n\nDepending on the distance between the striker and the chime tube, not all\nchime sets require a sail. Pictured right are closely spaced chimes that\neasily contact the striker with low to moderate winds. Because of the short\ndistance between the striker and the chime tube, the strike is not robust but\nadequate.\n\nThe best solution for you will depend on your type of wind. You may need to\ntry a few different sails for success.\n\nWindless Chimes On occasion there may be times when you want a set of chimes\nin a windless environment, or even outdoors in a low wind environment like a\nheavily wood area. Using an electromagnet to repel a high intensity magnet at\nthe end of the striker rod can provide you with endless possibilities.\n\nTypically named a chaos engine, this arrangement can produce a random movement\nfor the striker. Powered by either 120 VAC or a 12 VDC solar charged battery,\nthe electromagnet is controlled by a circuit board with an adjustable strike\nrate.\n\nYou can design your individual set of windless chimes using components\npurchased from Roger Sonntag at Sonntag Creations formerly Newton's Flying\nMagnets. Some of Roger's work is HERE\n\nBelow is a short video demonstrating some of the possibilities. Contact:\nsonntagcreations@gmail.com Ph: 585-615-4236\n\nTank Bells and Chimes\n\nOut of service compressed gas/air cylinders, scuba diving tanks or fire\nextinguishers are often cut and used as a chime or bell. Based on physical\nmeasurements can we pre-determine a musical note for these tanks? To the best\nof my research I do not find a mathematical method for calculating a musical\nnote for these tanks. Both the neck-end and the base-end seriously alter the\nvibration performance of the cylinder rendering existing formulas useless.\n\nHowever, once the tank has been cut to your desired length it is easy work to\ndetermine the fundamental frequency using an analysis program like Audacity\u00ae,\na free, open source, cross-platform software for recording and editing sounds.\n\nDo not use any formula, table or chart on this website to predict tanks\nmusical performance.\n\nThe frequency spectrum does not always follow the traditional overtone pattern\nfor a chime tube and can include a host of additional overtones normally\nassociated with the bell-like sound. See the spectrum diagram to the right.\n\nEnergizing all the overtones and avoiding the harsh sound when using a metal\nstriker can be a challenge. A golf ball or baseball can work well but requires\na robust strike to properly energize the overtones. I have not had good\nsuccess using a wood striker unless it's a really robust strike not typically\npossible with a normal wind sail.\n\nTank Length Matters or Maybe Not? A most perplexing situation can exist for\nsome tank lengths. We tested five sets of tank chimes, sets A, B, C, D, and E\npictured to the right. All chimes for sets D and E sounded distinctly\ndifferent and each had a different height, and a different fundamental\nfrequency and overtone structure; however, not true for sets A, B, and C.\n\nIn comparison, each chime in set A sounded exactly the same and had nearly\nidentical fundamental frequencies and nearly identical overtones, but\nrepresented three different lengths. The same was true for sets B and C. There\nwas a slight difference in timbre among the bells, but a considerable\ndifference in length for each set.\n\nSet B has both a neck-end and a base-end chime from a compressed-gas cylinder.\nWhile both chimes strike almost exactly the same fundamental frequency (295 Hz\nvs. 290 Hz), they are of different lengths and have a slightly different\ntimbre but sound mostly the same. Tank B was more melodious than tank A but\nnot a lot The difference in overtone structure is pictured to the right.\n\nI investigated circular mode resonance which is a function of just material\ntype, OD and wall thickness, and not length, as a possible explanation for\nthis effect. Unfortunately the circular mode resonance was considerably lower\nthan the observed resonance and offered no correlation to the actual\nmeasurements. The calculated vs. observed resonances were as follows:\nCalculated circular mode resonance were Set A = 35.4 Hz vs. 133 Hz; Set B=\n29.7 Hz vs. 290 Hz; Set C= 71.7 Hz vs. 354 Hz. The formula was provided by\nChuck from Chuck's Chimes and is: F = (T/(2*D^2))*SQRT(E/Density) where F =\nfrequency, E = modulus of elasticity, D = mean diameter, and T = wall\nthickness.\n\nI remain a bit perplexed on exactly why length appears to have little effect\non the fundamental frequency and the overtones structure above some critical\nlength point. Clearly this was not a rigorous scientific test, but enough to\ncause concern and points to need for further investigation.\n\nPictured below are a couple of tank chime examples from site visitor Grey Yahn\nfrom Pennsylvania.\n\nIf you're new to cutting metal and looking for an easy method, I use an\nabrasive metal cutting saw blade in a radial arm saw and it works equally well\nwith a cut-off saw, aka chop-saw.\n\nThe blade pictured left is under $5.00 at Home Depot. Make certain to use a\ncutting disk designed for the type of metal you plan to use. Using the wrong\ntype of abrasive disk can cause a dangerous explosion The traditional tubing\ncutter or hacksaw works well also. Definitely use safety glasses.\n\nSafety Caution: All these tanks are highly regulated by the US Department of\nTransportation (DOT), the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), by\nTransport Canada (TC) and others. Make certain the tank is safe for handling,\nis completely empty (fill with water and empty to assure all gases are\nexhausted), and is safe for cutting. Wear all recommended safety equipment\nincluding eye protection, hearing protection and respiratory protection. The\ntanks are heavy and can be dangerous when handling, use extreme caution.\n\nDecorating the Chime\n\nThe chime tube can be stained, dyed, anodized or painted. A light weight\ncoating of spray lacquer, spray polyurethane, spray paint, a powder coat or a\ncrackle/hammered/textured finish (pictured right) can be used without a\nnoticeable reduction in the sustain time. However, avoid thick heavy coats of\nlatex as they seriously reduce the sustain time and can kill the resonance.\n\nPatina finish on steel: Site visitor and artist, Roger Deweese, has\nsuccessfully applied a metal dye to produce some amazing patina finishes for\nhis tank bell chimes. Read here about the procedure Roger employed.\n\nThe Aged Copper Patina Look : a site visitor sent me a procedure to\nartificially age copper to provide the patina appearance. The procedure works\nwell and pictured to the left are the satisfactory results. I have included\nthe procedure here for your reference. Be patient with this procedure , it can\ntake several days to complete but the results are terrific.\n\nYou will need two commonly available chemicals to complete this process. The\nfirst is a rust remover that contains phosphoric acid. A couple of sources are\nNaval Jelly\u00ae or Rust KillerTM. Secondly, a toilet bowl cleaner that contains\neither hydrochloric or sulfuric acid. Some choices are Zep\u00ae Inc. Toilet Bowl\nCleaner, The Works\u00ae Toilet Bowl Cleaner, Misty\u00ae Bolex 23 Percent Hydrochloric\nAcid Bowl Cleaner and LIME-A-WAY\u00ae Toilet Bowl Cleaner. Read the content labels\ncarefully and look for any brand of rust remover that contains phosphoric acid\nand a toilet bowl cleaner that has either hydrochloric or sulfuric acid in\nyour local store.\n\nThese are dangerous chemicals. Wear safety glasses, old clothes, rubber gloves\nand follow all manufactures safety recommendations. If the chemical gets on\nyour skin wash immediately with a liberal amount of water. Use in a well\nventilated area.  \n---  \n  \nDownload the patina procedure HERE PDF\n\n  1. Begin by cutting your chime tubes to length and make any length adjustments necessary for tuning. De-burr and remove any sharp edges from both ends and the support hole.\n\n  2. Decide how you are going to support the chime, using either end caps or a support line at the 22.42% location. Attach a temporary line to support the chime vertically. This temporary line will get messy and can be discarded at the end of this procedure.\n\n  3. Clean the chime using a soapy solution of dish washing detergent like DawnTM or equivalent. I also used a fine grade steel wool to lightly scrub the surface. Dry completely.\n\n  4. Hang the chime vertically.\n\n  5. Soak a small soft paint brush or dry rag with the rust remover and completely coat the chime. Allow to drip-dry. This could take from a few hours to three days depending on your local humidity. This step slightly etches the surface of the copper in preparation for the next chemical step.\n\n  6. When the chime is completely dry remove the dried rust remover from the chime using a dry cloth. Do not use water.\n\n  7. Soak a small soft paint brush or dry rag with the toilet bowl cleaner and completely coat the chime. This could take from a few hours to a few days depending on your local humidity. A second coat will help to improve the patina look. This step causes the bluish green patina to develop in the etched surface and will darken the smooth surfaces.\n\n  8. Allow a few days to dry and the chime should ready for handling to install the final support lines.\n\n  9. The finished chime may not look like the picture above when newly completed. It can take a few weeks to completely darken and turn green in spots. Re-application of the toilet bowl cleaner may be necessary\n\n  10. I have had this patina set of chimes for several years and the patina look gets better every year and holds up well in all kinds of weather.\n\nArtificial aging copper for the patina appearance\n\n| Cleaned and ready for the process.

This will completely expose fresh copper and leave behind orbital\nscratches on the surface. Coat the sanded chime with a clear spray lacquer or\na spray polyurethane to preserve the new copper look. See picture to the\nright.The Science of ChimingWhat is a Tubular Bell Chime? Tubular chimes date\nto prehistoric times for a number of cultures, back nearly 5,000 years.\nTubular bells chimes were developed in the 1880's when using regular bells in\nan orchestra setting became impractical. Tubular bells closely imitate church\nbells and the practice of using a resonant tube as a bell soon flourished and\nbecame the traditional orchestra bell.Traditional church bells or tubular\nbells can be characterized by their strike note. That bell-like strike note\ncan be expanded to include the overtone structure, sustain time and loudness.\nThat sounds simple enough, but imbedded in that explanation are two\ndefinitions. The first definition is when a chime, properly designed and\nconstructed, can imitate a bell, and the second definition is that a chime may\nnot imitate a bell. Our objectives is to assist you to achieve the most bell-\nlike sound as possible.Compared to a string or brass musical instrument,\ndesigning a tubular bell chime presents a unique challenge not experienced\nelsewhere. Although unique, building a great set of tubular bells can be\neasily understood and implemented. Ending your project with a successful and\npleasing sound is important and setting the right expectations will allow that\nto happen. The information below may help you to better set realistic\nexpectations.| Loudness limits: One of the largest differences between a chime\nand other musical instruments is loudness. Loudness depends on the physical\nsize of the chime i.e. the radiating surface area. Compared to a string\ninstrument where a sounding board is used to amplify the vibration of the\nstring, or compared to a brass instrument that is fitted with a flared tube to\namplify the loudness, a chime has no amplifying assistance, other than the\ninherent surface area of the chime tube. Overall, this loudness limitation for\na typically sized chime-set will provide serious limitations for the available\nrange of effective note selection.On the other hand, if you move up from a\ntypical chime-set, into the really large mega chimes, then good loudness is\neasily achieved. For example, shown left is a large chime-set from Sandra\nBilotto.An exception is when the resonant frequency of the tube matches the\nair column resonance for the tube, as described by Chuck from Chuck's Chimes.\nAssistance from the energized air column adds a small amount of loudness.  \n---  \n  \nThe second limitation for loudness from a tubular chime depends on the\nlocation of the selected note compared to the natural sensitivity of the human\near. You can view the loudness sensitivity range vs. frequency of the ear by\nviewing the Fletcher/Munson Equal Loudness Curves. The ear has more\nsensitivity in the range from about 300 Hz to about 4 KHz, than at other\nfrequencies and helps to explain why we can not always hear all the overtones,\neven if they are present. This loudness limitation will have a direct affect\non what notes work best for a chime.\n\nProportional dimensions: Increasing the chime diameter increases the radiating\nsurface area and contributes to a louder chime but at a cost. The increased\ndiameter greatly increases the length requirement for a specific note, which\nis not necessarily bad; it just makes the chime set longer as the chime\ndiameter is increased. See the graph to the right for musical note C4\n\nOn the other hand, increasing the wall thickness has the opposite effect as an\nincrease in diameter. As the wall thickness increases there is a small\ndecrease in the length requirement for any specific note. In addition there\nwill be an increase in the sustain time from the increased mass. See the graph\nto the right.\n\nIncreasing the outside diameter while keeping the length and wall thickness\nconstant will cause a substantial increase in the resonant frequency.\n\nThe strike note vs. the sustaining note: The perceived musical note from a\nchime, when first struck, is not simply the fundamental chime tube frequency\nbut the addition from a host of overtone notes. Unfortunately, the strike note\n(which can have a very pleasing sound) has a short life or a short sustain\ntime caused by the rapid attenuation of the overtones.\n\nThe sustaining vibration (several seconds) will be the fundamental strike\nfrequency that may or may not be audible. Note selection will be decided by\nwhether you are interested in hearing just the strike note or perhaps more\ninterested in hearing the sustaining note.\n\nFor example, a chime used in an orchestra setting is typically a rapid\nsequence of notes with the strike note as the predominate sound, and little if\nany time is allowed for the sustaining note. On the other hand, a tubular bell\nwind chime is often characterized by the long sustain time of a note.\n\nThe overtone structure for a chime is not an integer harmonic as in string\ninstruments but instead, non-harmonic as in other percussion instruments. When\nthe chime is supported at the fundamental frequency node, see diagram at the\nleft, the higher partials are dampened but the fundamental strike frequency\nremains.\n\nOvertones exist and in a perfect metal where the density and the elasticity\nare constant, have theoretical multiples of the fundamental multiplied by X\n2.76, X 5.40, X 8.93, X 13.34, X 18.64 and X 31.87.\n\nHowever, in the real world of metal tubing, when metal does not have a\nconsistent density or elasticity, the multiples will drift from the\ntheoretical values either up or down by as much as +2% to -8% or more. If we\ncould hear the complete compliment of all overtones for each note of a chime\ntube, it would be a most wonderful bell-like sound.\n\nUnfortunately, not all the fundamental tones and/or all the overtones can be\nadequately radiated as an auditable sound by the chime tube for all possible\nlengths of a chime. This condition also limits the available range of notes\nthat have a bell-like sound.\n\nFor example, a chime cut for C2 (65.4 Hz), the fundamental frequency is\naudibly absent (aka the missing fundamental) along with little audible\ncontribution from the first overtone (180.5 Hz). The remaining overtones\ncombine to produce a perceived musical note. The perceived note does not\ncoincide with any specific overtone and is difficult to measure without a\nfrequency spectrum analyzer or perhaps a good musical ear.\n\nThe good news is that the brain processes the information present in the\novertones to calculate the fundamental frequency, using fuzzy logic. A\n\nYou can see from the waterfall display at the right (click to expand) that a\nchime cut for 272.5 Hz (near C_4^#), has two characteristics.\n\nThe first characteristic is the sound when the chime is first struck, the\nStrike Note. It comprises both the fundamental and the first four overtones,\nand has that traditional chime sound for a short period of time.\n\nThe 1st overtone contributes for about two seconds and rapidly deteriorates.\nThe remaining sound is solely the fundamental strike frequency. Note the long\nsustain time for the fundamental, pictured to the left of the photo.\n\nThe 2nd, 3rd and 4th overtones are present and contribute to the strike note\nbut attenuate quickly. They have little contribution to the lingering\nperceived sound, aka sustain time or hang-time\n\nIn contrast to the above example, the sound for a chime cut at fundamental C6\n(1046.5 Hz) and above is mostly the fundamental and the overtones are audibly\nabsent or mostly absent.\n\nIn addition to the many overtones that may be present for a chime, we have the\ndifficulty of knowing which overtones are prominent for each note, because of\nthe ear's sensitivity as represented by The equal loudness curves. As you\nmight suspect, the loudness of a particular overtone changes as we move up the\nscale.\n\nFor a typical ear sensitivity range of 300 Hz to 3 KHz, see the data audible\nfundamental and overtones for wind chime notes as a simple example for the\nrange of audible overtones. Obviously this is not the entire audible range of\nthe ear, but is presented as a simple example of the limited ability of the\near to hear all the frequencies generated by the overtone structure. In\nparticular, the range of C2 to C3 contain a large number of audible overtones\nwhile the range of C5 to C7 contains very few.\n\nThe note range from C2 thru C4 produce the most melodious sounds, most bell-\nlike, and are easy to build.\n\nPrecise tuning is not required unless the set is for an orchestra setting.\n\nThe missing fundamental is when the brain uses \"fuzzy logic\" to processes the\ninformation present in the overtones to calculate the missing fundamental\nfrequency. To gain a better understanding of the perceived note, I examined a\nset of orchestra grade chimes manufactured by a major UK manufacture.\n\nThe set was 1 1/2 inch chrome plated brass with a wall thickness of .0625\ninches and ranged 11\u20442 octaves from C5 (523.30 Hz) to G6 (1568.00 Hz). The\nlength of C5 was 62 5/8 inches. The fundamental frequency for this length is\naround 65 Hz, about C2^# , yet the perceived note is C5 at 523 Hz. The\nfundamental strike frequency of 65 Hz and the first overtone at 179.4 Hz (65 x\n2.76 = 179.4 Hz) are audibly absent, aka the missing fundamental.\n\nIn fact, even the second overtone at 351 Hz will not be strong in loudness.\nThe remaining overtones (mechanical vibration modes) combined to produce what\nthe ear hears acoustically, which is C5 at 523 Hz, yet there is not a specific\nfundamental or overtone at that exact frequency.\n\nI spoke with the people at a major USA chime manufacture (symphony grade) and\nconfirmed that indeed the process of tuning an orchestra grade chime is a\ncomplex process and understandably a closely held trade secret. The process\ninvolves accounting for all frequencies from the fundamental (whether present\nor missing) through the many overtones, by the use of math calculations,\nacoustic measurements, and the careful grinding of the chime to achieve the\ncorrect length for the desired note.\n\nAn orchestra chime is not supported by the classical wind chime method using a\nstring through the chime at the first frequency node 22.4%, but instead, is\nfitted with an end cap that contains a small top hole through which a steel\ncable supports the chime.\n\nFrom testing I find that the end cap not only enhances the bell-like sound, by\nincreasing the duration of the first overtone, but it also lowers the\nfundamental frequency by about 4% to 12 % from calculated values, depending on\ntube material and diameter.\n\nMore on this at Chime tube mechanical support. Many researchers have spent\ntime investigating the missing fundamental and the perceived note' from a\nchime. A few good sources are: Hyper Physics. Fuzzy logic and the subjective\npitch by Dr. John Askil (no longer available) and Wikipedia.\n\nThe Bell-Like Chime\n\nUsing the above characteristics for a chime, I found a limited set of notes\nthat will produce a bell-like sound from a tubular chime. Using the musical\nscale as a reference, they fall into three categories as follows:\n\nThe 1^st chime category (most bell-like) has a note range from about C2 to the\nC4 octave. The fundamental strike frequency is present but audibly absent, the\nmissing fundamental, and there are a host of well pronounced overtones.\n\nOften the first overtone can also be inaudible. The perceived sound is not the\nfundamental strike frequency and not the overtones, but an imaginary note\ncreated by the combination of the overtones. To the ear this is a very\nmelodious sound and clearly a bell-like sounding chime. The larger physical\nsize of this chime for this note range causes the loudness to be quite\nadequate, and easily supports radiation for the many overtones. Note in the\nspectrum displays below, as we move up the musical scale the overtone\ncontribution becomes less and less.\n\nThe 2^nd chime category (almost bell-like) has a note range from about C4\nthrough to about the C6 octave. The fundamental strike frequency is mostly\naudible and some overtones contribute to the perceived sound. The perceived\nnote is not the fundamental strike frequency and not the overtones, but a\ncombination of both that produce a perceived musical note. The sound can be\nacceptable but may not be the sound you are looking for. This has an almost\nbell-like sound and can sound fairly good, but not particularly melodious. The\nloudness is acceptable but not great.\n\nThe 3^rd chime category (non bell-like) has a note range from about C6 through\nthe C8 octave. Not unlike other percussion instruments this category is\ncharacterized by an audible fundamental strike frequency (a noticeable pure\ntone) with overtones mostly absent. Overtones have minimal contribution to the\nperceived musical note. This note range may not be particularly pleasing to\nthe ear but should not be ignored as a pure tone, and is definitely a non-bell\nsounding chime. In addition, the loudness is typically low caused by the short\nlength of the chime causing a low radiating surface for the higher notes. The\nrapid attenuation of high frequencies in the environment causes this note\nrange to quickly diminish at a distance.\n\nCalculations  \n---  \n  \nSkip the math? If your looking for DIY calculations or pre-calculated\ndimensions.\n\nI am not aware of calculations for a tube closed at one end. i.e. a chime with\nan end cap.\n\nThis math is for a tube open at both ends.\n\nThe bending natural frequency for a tube open at both ends is predicted by\nEuler's equation where:\n\nw = (B X L)^2 x \u221a (E X I/(rho X l4))\n\nw - frequency radian per second - for frequency in cycles per second (Hz), f =\nw/(2 x \u03c0) E - modulus of elasticity I - area moment of inertia = \u03c0 x d^3 x t/8\nfor a thin wall round tube d - mean diameter t - wall thickness rho = mass per\nunit length = Area x mass per unit volume = \u03c0 x d x t x density L - length of\ntube\n\nw= (B x L)^2 x (d/I^2) x \u221a (1/8) x \u221a (E/density)\n\n(B x L)^2 - Constants based on the boundary conditions for a wind chime (Free-\nFree Beam) (B x L)^2 = 22.373 for the first natural frequency. (B x l)^2 =\n61.7 for the second natural frequency. (B x L)^2 = 121 for the third natural\nfrequency. (B x L)^2 = 199.859 for the fourth natural frequency.\n\nTo get the units correct you must multiply the values inside the square root\nby gravity (g). g = 386.4 in/sec^2 for these units.\n\nFor a given material then the frequency of a thin wall tube reduces to: f =\nconstant x d / l^2\n\nThe reduced formula is: Area Moment of Inertia = \u03c0 x (OD^^4 - ID^^4)/64 Area =\n\u03c0 x (OD^^2 - ID^^2)/4 K = \u221a((Elasticity x Moment x Gravity)/(Area x Density))\n\nLength (inches) = \u221a(22.42 x K/(2 x \u03c0 x f))\n\nIf you want additional math on the subject here is a paper by Tom Irvine\n\nConclusions:  \n---  \n  \nClearly there is more to a chime than I had anticipated and I am sure I have\nnot learned all that there is to know about the physics of a chime. This was\noriginally a Christmas present for my daughters and not a focused research\nproject.\n\nI am convinced that it is not necessary to hand tune a set of bell-like chimes\ndesigned for musical notes from fundamental C2 through C4 because the formula\nachieves the desired frequency well within 1 Hz. Tuning to achieve an accuracy\ncloser than 1 Hz was a waste of time.\n\nHowever, for a fundamental note from C5 and up, good tuning is required. Good\nphysical measurements are important to achieve the calculated accuracy. My\nfavorite design has changed over the years and is currently an end cap\nsupported chime with the striker contacting the tube at the very bottom of the\nchime using either a tapered striker or a star striker, and having the wind\nrotate the chime set using a single line support for the support disk.\n\nUnfortunately, I know of no formula for calculating the length of a chime tube\nwith an end cap. I begin with a length from standard calculations on this page\nand then tune by trimming off the length. End caps lower the frequency by as\nmuch as 8% to 15%, which requires removal of material to raise the tuning back\nto the correct vale.\n\nYes, it's a lot of work if you want exact tuning for a tapered end! On\noccasion I have added an end cap to the calculated value for an open end tube\nin order to gain a more bell-like sound, but not adjusted the length to regain\naccurate tuning.\n\nFor the most part, it has been difficult to acoustically tell the difference\nbetween the un-tuned chime set with an end caps and a set of tuned chimes\nwithout end caps. Perhaps I have been lucky or maybe the natural shift caused\nby the end cap is consistent for all five tubes and they remain mostly in\ntune.\n\nYour particular type of wind (single-direction or turbulent) and wind speed\nwill determine the best choice for both the wind sail and for the chime\nstriker. Rotating the chime-set works well to solve the dingdong sound caused\nfrom low velocity single directions winds.\n\nAnother phenomena we observed, but did not have time to investigate, was the\nsimultaneous production of sound from the natural bending mode of the chime\ncoinciding with the resonance of the air column for the tube.\n\nThe good news is that another engineer, Chuck at Chuck's Chimes, has done an\nexcellent job detailing this effect. I suggest you give this a look-see. He\nhas excellent information and calculations to accomplish this special effect.\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/chuckchimes/home\n\nFAQs:  \n---  \n01\\.

This is the most\noften asked question. I saw somewhere on the site a casual comment about a\nchime not hitting C2. Did I misunderstand? I want to buy some 2 inch EMT and\ntune them in a Hirajoshi scale at C2 E F# G and B. But, that's $75 worth of\nEMT I'll be hacking up. Do you think it will work? I just want a really deep\nbass set of chimes and I am hoping 2 inch EMT of 66 to 9 inches (using your\nEMT table) will get me something deep and resonant. Any advice?\n\nAnswer: An excellent question and you read correctly. The chime will produce\nthe C2 note at 65.4 Hz, no problem, but the ear will not hear it? To hear 65.4\nHz we need to move a lot of air, thus the need for woofers used in sound\nsystems. If you place your ear about an inch from the long tube \"Surprise\" you\nhear the 65.4 Hz, it\u2019s actually there. But, back up two feet and you won\u2019t\nhear it.\n\nWhat you actually hear is a chime note missing both the fundamental (65.4 Hz)\nand the first overtone (180 Hz). You hear the remaining overtones.\n\nSo what to do? You can still make the long tubes cut for the C2 octave. The\nlarger size will enhance the overtones (second overtone, 353 Hz and up) and\nyou will hear lower notes than without using long tubes, but it will not be\nthe actual C2 note. If you happen to have a small public address amplifier and\nmicrophone, place the microphone about an inch from the tube. Again C2 is\nactually there, but it needs amplification to be audible. ^Back to FAQs^\n\n02\\. Question: We don't often have a lot of wind here so a design that doesn't\nneed a lot of wind is important. Somebody gave me a cheap little metal\ncommercial set and it basically never made any sound because there is rarely a\nstiff breeze. What are your thoughts about this? Answer: The force from the\nwind is cube law, meaning a doubling of wind speed produces nine times more\nforce acting on the chime. So little changes in the design can have a big\neffect on the sound. The best wind sail is one that works with your wind. If\nyou live inland in a sheltered area with low winds you want a light weight\nsail (probably thin aluminum sheet and large enough to adequately capture\nsmall winds, maybe 6-10 inches in diameter). If you live lakeside or by the\nsea shore with strong gusty winds then a heavier and smaller diameter sail is\nbest (use 1\u20444 to 1\u20442 inch treated lumber, engineered lumber or a plastic/nylon\ncutting board). ^Back to FAQs^ The best approach is experimentation. Every\nspecial design I\u2019ve done for myself or artist has never been a standard\ndesign. As such, I may need to build several prototypes where we change the\nspacing between the striker and the chime, the size and the weight of the wind\nsail. At first look, chimes seems incredibly simple, but the trick is\nimplementation. ^Back to FAQs^\n\n03\\. Question: Chimes for extremely high winds: When I say extreme, I mean\nregularly 150 km/hr (92 MPH) and occasionally up to 225 km/hr (140 MPH). My\nsolution is two fold; first, place the chime set on the opposite side building\nfrom where the high winds originate. However, on that side we still get 60 MPH\nwinds several times a year. Secondly, use very heavy pipe. I found some rusty\n2 inch pipe with 1/8 inch walls and cut a set for C4. Unfortunately, it wasn't\nlong enough for a C3, which I wanted. Problem: It's so heavy that it's tough\nto get much volume out of it, but it will resonates for ever. Do I want a hard\nstrike with a hockey puck? I also want to add in a 'star' type of thing to add\nsome light tones and to contain the striker inside the chimes.\n\nAnswer: Yes, with a heavy pipe you need a robust strike as you suggest. If a\nhockey puck is inadequate, try a scrap piece of treated lumber. If that is\ninadequate try hard maple or oak. Also, the size of the wind sail is important\nhere. Try different sizes until you achieve the sound you want.\n\nA star striker should work well in those high winds to assist in keeping\neverything aligned, but in extreme winds they will probably escape the star.\nYou may need to thread a 50# fishing line or weed trimmer line around the\noutside tips of the star to keep the tubes from escaping and getting mixed up.\nDrill a small horizontal hole at the tips for the monofilament line. See\npicture to the right. ^Back to FAQs^\n\n04\\. Question: I wanted to make a rod based wind chime twice as big as the\npre-calculated numbers, could I multiply the pre-calculated numbers by two (to\nget double the length) and still have the same tones as the pre-calculated\nnumbers describe, only a bit deeper?\n\nAnswer: No, but you're almost there. The relationship is not linear so\nmultiplication will not work, but there is an easy way to do this. Use the\nRatio Calculator. Say for example, you have a one inch steel rod and you want\nto go lower than the calculator will allow, i.e. below 32.7 Hz.\n\nUsing the calculator enter the type of metal and the rod outside diameter OD,\none inch steel. From there you will notice the lowest is 32.7 Hz with a length\nof 74 3/16 inches.\n\nUse the next tab at the bottom of the page named \"Tubing or Rod Length Ratio\nCalculator.\" See chart to the right.\n\nEnter what you know, i.e. 74 3/16 inches or 74.19 and the frequency 32.7 Hz.\nThen enter the desired frequency (half of the original) 16.35 Hz. The result\nwill be a length of 104 15/16 inches long with a hang point of 23 1\u20442 inches.\n\nRepeat this procedure for each note you wish to lower. The same goes for\nchimes. ^Back to FAQs^\n\n05\\. Question: What is the best line to re-string a chime set? I have about 20\nchimes that use a cheap support cord and the line breaks after a few years. I\nneed to re-string them and don\u2019t want to have to keep doing that. I need\nsomething more sturdy.\n\nAnswer: My all-time favorite to withstand the weather elements is light weight\nchain. You can use aluminum, brass, stainless steel, or zinc plated steel\nchain often found in hobby stores and occasional at the local home improvement\nstores. Depending on the weight of the chime tube (light weight only) my\nsecond choice is 80 pound braided fishing line. Make sure to de-burr the\nsupport holes smooth. A sources for chain is: FRANK R. FERRIS CO., INC. ^Back\nto FAQs^\n\n06\\. Question: Should I begin at C3 or C5? I was fortunate in coming across a\n20\u2019 section of 1.625OD x 1.375ID aluminum pipe. According to your spreadsheet\ncalculations I\u2019ve got just enough to make the C-9 chord starting with C3. In\nreading your info I see that some of the lower frequencies may not be heard\nmore than a few inches away. Given the size of this pipe do you think we\u2019ll be\nable to hear C3 or might we be better off making two shorter sets starting\nwith C5? The thought of the longer pipe set seems really neat!\n\nAnswer: As long as you have enough to begin at C3, by all means start there.\nYou won\u2019t hear much of C3 but the other notes will be much more melodious and\nbell like. I often start there or C2, depending on the physical limitations\nfor mounting and the intended application. ^Back to FAQs^\n\n07\\. Question: Chakra healing chimes: I am using 3 inch OD by 1/4 inch wall\naluminum tubing. I found a supply at the local scrap yard but don't know its\nalloy. Upon hanging an 8 ft. length from my workshop ceiling and striking it\nwith various beaters I was amazed at its tone and strength of vibration. Could\nyou help me determine the lengths required to build a set of Chakra healing /\nvibrational chimes consisting of 7 chimes? There are 7 notes / frequencies I\nwish to reproduce corresponding to the individual Chakra 's frequency; 396 Hz,\n417 Hz, 528 Hz, 639 Hz, 741 Hz, 852 Hz, 936 Hz and an eight option is 432 Hz.\nAnswer: Sure, just us the regular calculator for A=440 Hz, enter the OD, ID\nand type of metal then find the chakra frequencies in the frequency column. If\nthe calculator does not have your specific frequency, go to the bottom left\nhand side of the calculator and use the generic \"Calculate Length or\nFrequency\" calculator. Enter what you know in the blue font box Frequency or\nLength. Here you can enter a frequency and find the length and hang point, or\nenter a length and find its frequency and hang point. See picture below. ^Back\nto FAQs^\n\n08\\. Question: Can I use nickel-silver tubing? Is there a way to calculate the\nhang points based on your tables? ID on one tube is 0.5 inch, the other 2 are\n5/8 inch. My son, in the marching band, believes his trombone is a weapon of\nmass destruction. After 3 rebuilds, I have tubing from the leftover parts that\nI wish to turn into a wind chime. I asked the mechanic about the composition\nof the tubing (brass or ?) and he said it was nickel-silver. Sure enough, it\nhas a pleasant high-pitched ring despite the long (30 inch) length. However,\nthe hang points don't seem to correspond to the brass or aluminum columns in\nyour table.\n\nAnswer: Only two issues effect the sound from one metal to another, density\nand elasticity. The density of nickel-silver is 0.31 Lbm / in^3 and the\nelasticity is 18,500,000 psi. You can see from the chart at the right, nickel-\nsliver is very close to copper. I would suggest using the copper charts for\nthe pre-calculated measurements or use copper in the DIY calculator. The most\nimportant measurement is to hang the chime at the 22.4% point.\n\nOn the data page you can enter the actual density and elasticity to produce an\nexact calculation. ^Back to FAQs^\n\n09\\. Question: Can I mix sizes and metals? Answer: Yes you can mix sizes\nwithin a given metal and you can mix metals. Make sure you use the correct\nchart settings for each size, wall thickness and type of metal. Best to\nexperiment with different metals because some combinations sound wonderful and\nother not so good. ^Back to FAQs^\n\n10\\. Question: Wondering why these tubes sound better when the striker is\nplaced an inch below center on the shortest tube with the tops all the same\nheight? When the striker is placed an inch below the center of the longest the\nshort tube has little to no sound? Answer: We want to avoid exact dead center\nor near dead center for any chime and when they are center aligned that is an\neasy task. But when they are top or bottom aligned the striker can\ninadvertently come close to dead center for one of the chimes. Because chime\nlength is not a linear relationship as we move up and down the musical scale,\nexact placement of the striker for every chime set is slightly different. You\ndid the right thing by experimenting to find the best sound. On most every\nset, I often adjust the striker higher or lower to achieve the best sound from\nevery chime. ^Back to FAQs^\n\n11\\. Question: I am working on a Mark Tree chime set (bar chimes, used by\npercussionists and drummers, pictured right). I checked on the commercial ones\nand they all use the same hang point on the bars. It may be because it is\ncheaper and quicker to make them this way and they look good, but will not\nsound as good as the 22.4% hanging point method? I'd like to hear your opinion\nabout this topic! Answer: A bar or chime can be supported at any point along\nits length and will ring when struck, but not well. Good sustain time and rich\ncontribution from the overtones, that produce the bell-like sound, can only\noccur when supported at the 22.4% location. All bars in the set pictured here\nwill sound distinctly different from each other, but will not yield the bell-\nlike sound because of improper mounting.\n\nAs a footnote, my neighbor (a very practical engineer) built a xylophone and\ndid some experimenting with support points for the bars. He did not know bout\nthe 22.4% rule. His choice was 22% from each end because that location\nprovided the best sustain time and the best sound. I completely agree with his\nfindings (22.4%). ^Back to FAQs^\n\n12\\. Question: Is there a length where a tube of a given size will not\nresonant as intended? Specifically, I cut a tube of 1.5 inch thinwall steel\nconduit to 1002mm, and it sounds higher in pitch than an adjacent 730 mm tube,\nwhich should sound higher. I just can't wrap my head around this. Answer: You\ndiscovered part of the missing fundamental phenomena. The chime tube appears\nnot to resonant at the design frequency but it does resonate. The 1002mm\nlength has a fundamental resonance of about 193 Hz and that frequency is\ndifficult to hear because of the low sensitivity of the ear at the lower\nfrequencies (mostly below 300 Hz). Therefore, you will hear the second\novertone better which is 193 Hz x 2.76 = 523 Hz. The fundamental for the 730mm\nchime is about 384 Hz which is getting more into the sensitive range of the\near and you are much more likely to hear it's fundamental as compared to the\nfundamental for the 1002mm chime. Thus the longer tube will sound higher\npitched than the shorter tube which is definitely counter intuitive. ^Back to\nFAQs^\n\n13\\. Question: Does a coating (powder coat, anodize or paint) affect the tone\nquality, tuning, or note sustain of the pipe? Some chimes are anodized or\nappear to have a clear coat type finish for weather resistance for aesthetics\nI assume. Answer: In general, the answer is no bad effect occurs . However, if\nyou were to apply a thick latex paint type coating, the extra mass would have\na noticeable effect, perhaps to the point of killing resonance. However, a\nthin powder coat or anodizing will have no affect on the design frequency or\nsustain time. ^Back to FAQs^\n\n14\\. Question: Can I use anodized aluminum and is it expensive? I recently\ncame across your website as I researched the idea of building a set of wind\nchimes for my wife for our anniversary. I spent several hours reading your\nwebsite and have found more than enough step by step info on how to do what I\nwant to do. You absolutely answered every question I had and several more.\nAnswer: There is no difference in the sound created using either power coated\nor anodized metal. The only slight exception is if there is a heavy clear coat\nover the power coat. A light coat is okay. A heavy coat slightly reduces the\nsustain time, but not much.\n\nCost wise I don\u2019t have much experience here. I have seen very reasonably\npriced anodized aluminum on the internet, nearly the cost of un-anodized. If\nyou\u2019re buying tubing already power coated, as opposed to having it done in a\ncustom shop, I would not expect it to be expensive. ^Back to FAQs^\n\n15\\. Question: Do you have a Phone App to calculate chime lengths? Answer: I\ndo not but site visitor Andrew Hughes uses the formulas from this website has\nan Android Version in the Google Play store. ^Back to FAQs^\n\n16\\. Question: The hang point is usually close but far from exact on chimes I\nhave measured. Should you drill the hang point hole at the center of the\ncalculated measurement or is the hang point where the string actually contacts\nthe tube (upper edge of the hole)? Answer: The location for small holes, 1/8\ninch or less, can be exactly on the mark. However, holes larger than 1/8 inch\n(particularly 1\u20444 inch and larger) should be positioned, as you suggest, so\nthe upper edge of the hole is where the support line touches the chime. ^Back\nto FAQs^\n\n17\\. Question: Does the hole size that you drill for the hang point matter?\nAnswer: Yes, if the hole is large, relative to the diameter of the tube, it\ncan affect the design frequency, but a small hole has no effect. I personally\nuse 1/8 inch for many of the chimes .If you need a hole larger than 1/8 inch,\nposition it so upper edge of the hole is on the hang point mark. ^Back to\nFAQs^\n\n18\\. Question: Chimes not Chiming! I recently bought two, not cheap, wind\nchimes \u2013 and they do not chime in the absence of hurricane gale winds! Is\nthere anything we can do to get them to catch any breeze that happens by?\nWould the CD section in your article be all he needs? I have spent a long time\non the internet looking for some quick fix but can\u2019t find anything. The power\ncompany recently cut down all the shrubs we have been carefully tending for\nyears and now we have dreadful road noise. The chimes are an optimistic\ndetraction to that new situation.\n\nAnswer: Yes, there are several options. You describe a common condition where\nthe sail is either too small or too heavy to supply a good jerk to the\nstriker. Without seeing the set of chimes directly, I suggest you replace the\nwind sail with something larger and lighter weight. As a test, I use an old CD\nfor a temporary sail, just to make the point that it needs to be light weight\nand fairly large in size. Often an old CD is not large enough. You can use\nanything that pleases your eye that meets the size and light weight\nrequirements from your testing.\n\nAlso, don't overlook the diameter of the striker. When the distance between\nthe striker and the chime considerably exceeds one inch\n\nthe chimes may not respond to well to any wind. ^Back to FAQs^\n\n19\\. Question: Where do I get mounting pins, what size is recommended and how\nare they held in position?\n\nAnswer: I typically use 1/8 inch brass rod that can be found at my local hobby\nstore (where a person can buy model airplane parts, model trains, model cars\nand the like ) and occasionally at home improvement stores like Home Depot,\nLowe\u2019s, Menards, etc. If you insert an 1/8 inch rod or tube into a 1/8 inch\nhole, it can be loose. Use a ball-peen hammer to slightly flatten each end of\nthe pin for a force fit or use a spot of glue. With copper chimes, the pin can\nbe soldered. Then, file off the excess, leaving little to no evidence of the\npin. ^Back to FAQs^\n\n20\\. Question: How does the string stay in the middle of the pin so not to\nslide off to one side?\n\nAnswer: A spot of super glue, hot glue or epoxy will do the trick. A knot also\nworks well. ^Back to FAQs^\n\n21\\. Question: Is it possible to support a chime in a way that it is fixed,\nfor example with a nail, without losing its tune? Also is it possible to\nsupport it so I won't need to drill a hole? I would like to build a music box\nthat uses a chime tube.\n\nAnswer: Yes, the chime can be mounted for a fixed support using a number of\nmethods. Any method should locate the support at 22.4% from both ends.\n\nThe noninvasive method uses the traditional one wrap string method for\nsupporting an orchestra grade chime or bar, as shown right, courtesy of\nWoodstock Chimes. Locate the chime above or below the line, either method\nworks equally well.\n\nAn invasive and more rugged mount can be from a stud on one or both sides of\nthe mounting location as shown left. A locking nut on the outside of the chime\nwill secure the stud in place and allow attachment to the supporting\nstructure, as often found in playground chimes. I would avoid inserting a bolt\nthrough the chime tube, because tightening nuts on both sides can stress the\ntube causing it not to resonate or reduce the sustain time. ^Back to FAQs^\n\n22\\. Question: How do I attach the support line to the support pin when the\npin is down in the tube? I plan to make a chime set using 2 inch steel\nelectrical conduit. The largest chime would have a hang point of 9 5/8 inches\nfrom the top. How do I get the line around the pin when it is 9 5/8 inches\nfrom the top?\n\nAnswer: Hold the tube horizontal with the support pin also horizontal. Tilt\nthe tube to be mostly vertical, but not quite. Feed the line down the tube on\nthe bottom side, passing one side of the pin and out the other end. You may\nneed to attach a small weight to the end of the line, like a pinch-on fishing\nline sinker, to provide sufficient weight so the line will feed all the way\nthrough. You can also blow on the tube or use compressed air to force the line\nout the other end.\n\nNext, rotate the tube 180 degrees and starting from the other end, feed the\nline back down the tube, passing the opposite side of the pin. Pull both ends\nof the line up to the pin from the top end, and tie a slip knot. Pull the knot\ntaught around the pin as shown to the right. You may need to adjust the line\nto be in the center of the pin using a coat hanger wire or other handy\nutensil.\n\nIt may be difficult to see inside a dark tube. Place a white paper on the\nfloor and hold the tube above the paper as you peer into the tube. This\ngenerally allows enough light in to see the location for the line centered on\nthe pin. ^Back to FAQs^\n\n23\\. Question: I want to use a tapered striker for (6) 2 inch chimes, and the\ncalculated striker size is 3.25 inch radius, would that be the top or the\nbottom diameter?\n\nAnswer: That should be the largest diameter, i.e. bottom diameter if tapered\nor center diameter if bullet nose. ^Back to FAQs^\n\n24\\. Question: Best striker shape and weight for a chime set. My son gave me 3\nstainless tubes. They have a diameter of 6 inches and between 5-6 feet long.\nIn a way, my chimes will be similar to the ones on your site from Craig\nHewison, except he has 5 chimes where I have 3. This means the spacing for my\nchimes will be greater. My plan is to line up the bottoms of the chimes. My\nthought is to use a circular wooden disk of either the tapered edge or knife\nedge or straight edge design. I would say my home area has light to moderate\nwinds, for the most part. Do you have comments on these 3 designs?\n\nAnswer: My preference is a bullet nose edge for large tubes. Heavy chimes need\na robust strike and a rounded edge striker last longer, and can be simple to\nfabricate. Regarding the weight, I would start with a 1.5 inch thick section\nof treated lumber, not any thicker, 3\u20444 inch could work.\n\nThere is a close relationship between a striker\u2019s weight and the ability of\nthe sail to adequately jerk the striker. Because of that relationship, I\ncannot suggest an exact weight but I do suggest experimentation. I often find\nmyself making two or three strikers before I am satisfied with the overall\nperformance from both the striker and the sail. You could take a scrap of wood\nand approximate the size and weight of your wind sail and hang it where you\nintend to place the chimes. Then watch it for a few days to judge its\nmovement.\n\nUsing three tubes, I would not suggest the orthogonal sail. Once that sail get\nto swinging, it can depart a lot of energy and I am concerned that would cause\nthe striker to escape to the outside of the set, not all bad, but it can be a\nnuisance. I often need to experiment with two or three strikers and sails to\nachieve the desired sound. The good news is the sail can be larger than normal\nbecause a large sail doesn\u2019t look so big next to large chimes. ^Back to FAQs^\n\n25\\. Question: Does the diameter of the support pin affect the chime sound? I\nam using 2 inch tubing and the brass support rod I am considering is 1/4 inch\nin diameter, so quite substantial. Trying to use what I have during virus\nlockdown.\n\nAnswer: A 2 inch (55mm) tube with a 1/4 inch support rod should be fine. I\nwould not recommend it for a smaller tube like 1 inch OD. Normally I have not\nused that larger size and prefer 1/8 inch or slightly less. Just make sure\nit's snug and cannot rattle or work loose. ^Back to FAQs^\n\n26\\. Question: I saw chimes on a tropical island made from sticks of coral.\n(worn staghorn coral on the beach, which was there by the millions of tons due\nto hurricanes.) So I brought back a bunch of sticks of coral. But trying to\nget maximum wind chime effect is hard, especially on the first try. The coral\nis much heavier than metal, but it does have a sort of ceramic waterford ring\nto it. I cannot find any specific plans, but I was leaning towards orienting\nmany of the pieces horizontally for maximum instability and strikes. I also\nwanted to stay with natural materials and make the top support out of maybe\ntwo longer pieces of coral in an X configuration.\n\nAnswer: My first attempt would be to carefully measure down from each end\n22.4% (.224) and tie a monofilament fishing line or perhaps a braided fishing\nline at those points for support, then test their sound by carefully striking\nthe coral with the sole of a hard rubber shoe. I have no experience with coral\nchimes but they should follow the basic laws of physics. They will probably\nneed a robust striker because of their small size, depending on how easily\nthey break. Also try a striker with more rigidity, like a plastic plate. ^Back\nto FAQs^\n\n27\\. Question: I use your calculator for calculations but what I don\u2019t\nunderstand is when I use smaller diameter pipes the suggested length is also\nshorter. Shouldn\u2019t smaller pipes produce a higher pitch? Below is an example:\nthe first is with diameter 80mm. Here it suggested the lowest pipe is 974.7mm.\n\nWhen I change the diameter to 40mm, I only need a pipe of 684.2 mm for the C5\nnote.\n\nIn my opinion, the pitch should be going up when I use smaller pipes, but that\ndoesn\u2019t correspond to your chart. Can you help me to understand the suggested\nlengths? Answer: welcome to the complicated world of circular resonance. This\nis best explained with some info from the website under the section for\nproportional dimensions. Increasing the chime diameter increases the radiating\nsurface area and contributes to a louder chime but at a cost. The increased\ndiameter greatly increases the length requirement for a specific note, which\nis not necessarily bad; it just makes the chime set longer as the chime\ndiameter is increased. See the graph below for musical note C4.\n\nIn your case, decreasing the diameter considerably shortens the length for a\ngiven note. So, your observations are perfectly normal. ^Back to FAQs^\n\n28\\. Question: Is there a way to quiet the (waw -wau) effect that frequently\nfollows the intended sound? I\u2019ve made a wind chime using 1.250 metal conduit\nand that sound can be annoying. Answer: That sound is caused by imperfections\nin manufacturing causing a change of stiffness and density from one end to the\nother. Mostly caused by handling and processing of the tube. I don\u2019t know of\nany way to eliminate it. Yes, it can be annoying. ^Back to FAQs^\n\n29\\. Question: I am using the sanded copper look, and I\u2019m going to buy some\npolyurethane spray to coat them. Do I want water-based or oil-based? I\u2019m going\nto use the same spray on the wooden parts. amber. Other than that, I don't\nhave a preference. ^Back to FAQs^ Answer: The big difference is color. Oil\nbased is amber color and water based is clear and remains clear forever. Oil\nwill continue to turn\n\n30\\. Question: I\u2019m having a little trouble figuring out what kind of material\nI\u2019m going to use for my sail. Any info would be appreciated. Answer: I prefer\nthin aluminum sheet for sails in low winds. It's light weight and can depart a\nquick impact to the chime compared to heavier material like wood or plastic.\nIt more depends on wind conditions. Strong winds you want a heavier striker.\nAluminum works best in light winds. ^Back to FAQs^\n\n31\\. Question: I have a large 6-chime set with a round striker. as wondering\nif you have a recommendation to keep the striker in During high winds the\nstriker sometimes gets outside the chimes or wrapped around one of them. One\nof your FAQs suggested a star shaped striker with fish line connecting each\ntip to keep chimes in place. Do you think such a method could be used for a\nround striker? Answer: Yes, there are two answers.\n\nFirst, drill a small hole at the tips of the star striker and thread small\nmonofilament fishing line around the circle. That will contain each chime in\nthe star.\n\nSecondly drill a tiny hole through each chime at the same horizontal location\nfrom the bottom and thread a monofilament plastic line through each chime all\naround all the chimes. See attached picture. You may have to experiment with\nvarious lines to find one that works. Maybe a small weed trimmer line. As you\ndo this, tie a knot on the outside of each chime to prevent the chime from\nslipping along the line. This will keep the chimes evenly spaced and from\nseparating in high winds, preventing escapement of the striker. ^Back to FAQs^\n\n32\\. Question: I am building a large tube wind chime and noticed you mention\ntwo locations to support the tubes. The 22.4% location and the Top End Cap.\nWill it create any problems to weld a washer on the end of the tube, and\ninsert a cord through the center, as a make shift end cap? Answer: That should\nwork okay but I would first experiment. I would suggest you cut the first tube\nlittle long and weld on the washer. Then test it to make sure the sustained\ntime is adequate. The one thing that gets fussy is that the weld needs to be\nvery uniform around the circumference. If not, it will completely kill the\nchime. I have had good success with this technique using solder so welding\nshould be just fine. If your test is not successful, then you can trim off the\nworld and use the traditional approach. ^Back to FAQs^\n\n33\\. Question: I came into possession of a broken 20 foot long aluminum\ntapered flag pole. The O. D. is 3 inches at the bottom and 2 inches at the\ntop. I presume this would still work but I may have to sneak up on the final\nlengths of the pieces by sound. Do you foresee any specific problems with\nsetup? Answer: Sure, I would expect it to work fine. The calculator will\nprobably not be accurate but might be close. ^Back to FAQs^\n\n34\\.

Question: I noticed a high end set of chimes have slightly chamfered ends\nrevealing a nice circle of shiny metal. Have you ever seen how this is\naccomplished? It is so perfectly done that I don't think a hand file is used.\nI'm picturing some sort of a jig, holding the tube at an angle, with the end\nmaking light contact with a rotating sanding disk or file of some sort?\nAnswer: Yes, there are numerous ways to chamfer the ends. Many do it in a\nmetal lathe. As you suggest I have laid a clean towel on the worktable and by\nhand, roll the chime back and forth as you file or use an orbital sander to\nproduce the bevel. I typically begin with a sander to remove most of the\nmaterial and finish with a file to produce a perfect looking chamfer. ^Back to\nFAQs^\n\n36\\. Question: Square vs. Round Tubing. I have square tubing left over from a\ngreenhouse project. Can I use it to make chimes and will the calculator work\nfor square tubing? Answer: The calculator will NOT work for square tubing but\nthe overall ratios will probably be similar, For example, say you're using the\nC9 scale or the pentatonic scale, calculate the length as if it were round\ntubing and the ratio from one note to the other should closely track as if it\nwere round tubing. Caution, not all square tubing will resonate. Cut your\nfirst tube, drill the support holes at the 22.4% location and hang the tube.\nUsing the sole of a hard rubber shoe strike the chime and determine if you\nlike the sound. ^Back to FAQs^\n\n37\\. Question: Can we use bamboo with the calculator? Answer: No, the\ncalculator will not work for bamboo. It only works for round tubing open at\nboth ends. I have never located a formula for bamboo. You can experiment and\nprobably find notes that sound good and would work well in a set. ^Back to\nFAQs^\n\n38\\. Question: How many chimes in a chime set? My wife and I will be\ncelebrating our 7th wedding anniversary and I thought a copper wind chime\nwould be a great way to continue our tradition. Every year, we exchange\n\"traditional anniversary gifts\" and year seven is copper. I was hoping to\nincorporate the number 7 somewhere in the project, which led me to wonder if\nthere are any chime configurations that require 7 tubes. I didn't see one in\nthe musical note selection section of your website but I did see St.\nMichael's, which as you know requires 8. Could I simply subtract one from this\narray and if so, which one do I choose? Answer: You can add or subtract from\nany sequence. If you want more than the sequence count, just repeat the\nsequence by moving up or down an octave on the music scale until you achieve\nyour desired count. This concept of sequences and naming chime sets like\nCorinthian Bells, Winchester or Pentatonic is a marketing exercise to sell\nmore chime sets. They never play in sequence and the listener will likely\nnever identify what the random sounds really represent. They're just jumbled\nup notes. Selling chime sets with famous names is advertising on steroids. For\nexample, the happy birthday chime set will sound like happy birthday when\nplayed in sequence but otherwise it's a random collection of notes. ^Back to\nFAQs^\n\n39\\.

I do accept donations to help pay for the\nwebsite. Several people around the world have successfully created a small\nwind chime business from this information.^Back to FAQs^\n\n40\\. Question: Gas cylinder chimes: I recently acquired about a dozen gas\ncylinders - all steel, ranging from about 5 to 10 inches in diameter, and I\nwant to construct a set of bells using them. - Should the tapered top be left\nattached, with a threaded hole for fixing an eyebolt, or should the cylinder\nbe cut into a true cylinder with drilled holes and a cable suspension? I have\nseen many cylinder bells that ring pretty well, but I suspect the closed top\nis dampening the sound. I was thinking of a cross rod at the proper suspension\npoint. How do I calculate lengths and hanging points for a pleasing chord?\nAnswer: I recommend leaving the tapered top on the tank. I have tried it both\nways, with and without, and the tapered top does not reduce sustained time and\nmakes mounting much easier using an eye bolt, as you suggested. Tank chimes\nhave turned out to be one of my enigmas. I tried my best to find a\nmathematical solution to predicting resonance but failed. ^Back to FAQs^\n\nLinks and Sources\n\nSay It With Chimes is also used as a reference for The Physics Classroom\n\nWoodworking for Mere Mortals A fun site for many projects including an\nexcellent video about using the resources from this site.\n\nThe Sound of Bells This site has not only informative pages on bell sounds and\ntuning, but offers free software that lets you listen to the effects of\novertones and allows you to tune your bell or chime using a sound card and\nmicrophone.\n\nThe Strike Note of Bells\n\nChuck's Chimes Another engineer, Chuck, has an excellent website for chime\ncalculations and information. https://sites.google.com/site/chuckchimes/home\n\n* Equations from paper by Tom Irvine Website\n\nAn interesting physics class, student project, authored by Professor G.\nWilliam Baxter and Assistant Professor Keith M.
