Credit: Meatable\n\nRelated tags cultured meat\n\nDutch food technology firm Meatable has successfully hosted the first-ever\nlegally approved cultivated meat tasting in the EU.\n\nThe trial represents the first in a series of sessions set to take place in\nthe Netherlands, after the Dutch Government granted permission to cultivated\nmeat firms in January 2024.\n\nOn 17 April, Meatable welcomed a number of guests to its new headquarters in\nLeiden to sample its cultivated pork sausages, with those in attendance\nincluding Michelin starred chef Ron Blaauw, Prince of the Netherlands\nConstantijn van Oranje and entrepreneur Ira van Eelen, the daughter of\ncultivated meat pioneer Willem van Eelen.\n\nAn independent expert committee formed by the Dutch Government will evaluate\neach tasting session, which it is hoped will lead to the country legalising\nthe sale of cultured meat products.\n\nMeatable uses its proprietary Opti-OX technology to take one cell from a pig\nand turn it into a cultivated sausage in only four days, a process which it\nclaims is 60 times faster than the time it takes to rear a pig for pork on a\ntraditional farm.\n\nBy reducing cell differentiation time, the company can produce cultivated meat\nat a significantly reduced cost, with new process requiring half as many\nbioreactors at its former method.\n\nThis year, Meatable plans to launch its first products in Singapore, where it\nhas held multiple product tastings following approval to do so from the\nSingapore Food Agency (SFA).\n\nPending approval from the SFA, Meatable\u2019s products will be available in\nselected restaurants, while the company is also focused on entering the US in\n2025, pending regulatory approvals.\n\n### \u2018Incredibly proud to host first session\u2019\n\nCommenting on the success of its first tasting session, Meatable CEO Krijn de\nNood said: \u201cWe are incredibly proud to hold the first official cultivated meat\ntasting in the EU marking a landmark moment for Meatable and our industry.\n\n\u201cAt Meatable, we have been working tirelessly over the last five years to\ndevelop a delicious product that looks like, tastes like and has the same\ntexture and flavor profile as farm raised meat. We now have the opportunity to\nverify those findings and further optimize our product before mass market\nentry.\n\n\u201cI want to thank our guests for supporting the product and contributing to our\nmission to satisfy the world\u2019s appetite for real meat without harming people,\nanimals or the planet. We look forward to hosting many more tastings in the\nfuture as we work towards regulatory approval and global commercialisation.\u201d\n\nIn other news, leading food producer Samworth Brothers has acquired The Real\nWrap Co for an undisclosed fee.\n\nSet up a job alert\n\nCopyright - Unless otherwise stated all contents of this web site are \u00a9 2024 -\nWilliam Reed Ltd - All Rights Reserved - Full details for the use of materials\non this site can be found in the Terms & Conditions\n\nRelated topics Legal NPD Food Safety Emerging Science & Tech\n\n## Related news\n\nShow more\n\n  * Unilever recalls Magnums due to metal and plastic contamination concerns: Round up\n  * Molson Coors to invest \u00a3100m in UK operations\n  * Food and drink inflation rate continues to fall\n  * Mosa Meat raises \u20ac40m to scale cultivated meat capabilities\n\nShow more\n\n#### Follow us\n\n#### Featured Jobs\n\nView more\n\n  * Technical Officer (Interim) CAMPBELLS PRIME MEAT LTD Linlithgow, West Lothian\n  * Forklift Driver - Nights The People Co.
