Group 15 is also known as the nitrogen group or nitrogen\nfamily. Group 15 consists of the elements nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P),\narsenic (As), antimony (Sb), bismuth (Bi), and moscovium (Mc).\n\nSince 1988, IUPAC calls it Group 15. Before that, in America it was called\nGroup VA, owing to a text by H. C. Deming and the Sargent-Welch Scientific\nCompany, while in Europe it was called Group VB and IUPAC recommended that in\n1970.^[2] (Pronounced \"group five A\" and \"group five B\"; \"V\" is the Roman\nnumeral 5). In semiconductor physics, it is still usually called Group V.^[3]\nThe \"five\" (\"V\") in the historical names comes from the \"pentavalency\" of\nnitrogen, reflected by the stoichiometry of compounds such as N_2O_5. They\nhave also been called the pentels.\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n### Chemical[edit]\n\nLike other groups, the members of this family manifest similar patterns in\nelectron configuration, notably in their valence shells, resulting in trends\nin chemical behavior.\n\nZ| Element| Electrons per shell  \n---|---|---  \n7| nitrogen| 2, 5  \n15| phosphorus| 2, 8, 5  \n33| arsenic| 2, 8, 18, 5  \n51| antimony| 2, 8, 18, 18, 5  \n83| bismuth| 2, 8, 18, 32, 18, 5  \n115| moscovium| 2, 8, 18, 32, 32, 18, 5(predicted)  \n  \nThis group has the defining characteristic whereby each component element has\n5 electrons in their valence shell, that is, 2 electrons in the s sub-shell\nand 3 unpaired electrons in the p sub-shell. They are therefore 3 electrons\nshy of filling their valence shell in their non-ionized state. The Russell-\nSaunders term symbol of the ground state in all elements in the group is\n^4S_3\u20442.\n\nThe most important elements of this group to life on Earth are nitrogen (N),\nwhich in its diatomic form is the principal component of air, and phosphorus\n(P), which, like nitrogen, is essential to all known forms of life.\n\n#### Compounds[edit]\n\nBinary compounds of the group can be referred to collectively as pnictides.\nMagnetic properties of pnictide compounds span the cases of diamagnetic\nsystems (such as BN or GaN) and magnetically ordered systems (MnSb is\nparamagnetic at elevated temperatures and ferromagnetic at room temperature);\nthe former compounds are usually transparent and the latter metallic. Other\npnictides include the ternary rare-earth (RE) main-group variety of pnictides.\nThese are in the form of RE_aM_bPn_c, where M is a carbon group or boron group\nelement and Pn is any pnictogen except nitrogen. These compounds are between\nionic and covalent compounds and thus have unusual bonding properties.^[4]\n\nThese elements are also noted for their stability in compounds due to their\ntendency to form covalent double bonds and triple bonds. This property of\nthese elements leads to their potential toxicity, most evident in phosphorus,\narsenic, and antimony. When these substances react with various chemicals of\nthe body, they create strong free radicals that are not easily processed by\nthe liver, where they accumulate. Paradoxically, this same strong bonding\ncauses nitrogen's and bismuth's reduced toxicity (when in molecules), because\nthese strong bonds with other atoms are difficult to split, creating very\nunreactive molecules. For example, N_2, the diatomic form of nitrogen, is used\nas an inert gas in situations where using argon or another noble gas would be\ntoo expensive.\n\nFormation of multiple bonds is facilitated by their five valence electrons\nwhereas the octet rule permits a pnictogen for accepting three electrons on\ncovalent bonding. Because 5 > 3, it leaves unused two electrons in a lone pair\nunless there is a positive charge around (like in [NH_4]^+). When a pnictogen\nforms only three single bonds, effects of the lone pair typically result in\ntrigonal pyramidal molecular geometry.\n\n#### Oxidation states[edit]\n\nThe light pnictogens (nitrogen, phosphorus, and arsenic) tend to form \u22123\ncharges when reduced, completing their octet. When oxidized or ionized,\npnictogens typically take an oxidation state of +3 (by losing all three\np-shell electrons in the valence shell) or +5 (by losing all three p-shell and\nboth s-shell electrons in the valence shell). However heavier pnictogens are\nmore likely to form the +3 oxidation state than lighter ones due to the\ns-shell electrons becoming more stabilized.^[5]\n\n##### \u22123 oxidation state[edit]\n\nSee also: nitride, phosphide, arsenide, antimonide, and bismuthide\n\nPnictogens can react with hydrogen to form pnictogen hydrides such as ammonia.\nGoing down the group, to phosphane (phosphine), arsane (arsine), stibane\n(stibine), and finally bismuthane (bismuthine), each pnictogen hydride becomes\nprogressively less stable (more unstable), more toxic, and has a smaller\nhydrogen-hydrogen angle (from 107.8\u00b0 in ammonia^[6] to 90.48\u00b0 in\nbismuthane).^[7] (Also, technically, only ammonia and phosphane have the\npnictogen in the \u22123 oxidation state because, for the rest, the pnictogen is\nless electronegative than hydrogen.)\n\nCrystal solids featuring pnictogens fully reduced include yttrium nitride,\ncalcium phosphide, sodium arsenide, indium antimonide, and even double salts\nlike aluminum gallium indium phosphide. These include III-V semiconductors,\nincluding gallium arsenide, the second-most widely used semiconductor after\nsilicon.\n\n##### +3 oxidation state[edit]\n\nSee also: nitrite, phosphite, arsenite, antimonite, and bismuthite\n\nNitrogen forms a limited number of stable III compounds. Nitrogen(III) oxide\ncan only be isolated at low temperatures, and nitrous acid is unstable.\nNitrogen trifluoride is the only stable nitrogen trihalide, with nitrogen\ntrichloride, nitrogen tribromide, and nitrogen triiodide being\nexplosive\u2014nitrogen triiodide being so shock-sensitive that the touch of a\nfeather detonates it (the last three actually feature nitrogen in the -3\noxidation state). Phosphorus forms a +III oxide which is stable at room\ntemperature, phosphorous acid, and several trihalides, although the triiodide\nis unstable. Arsenic forms +III compounds with oxygen as arsenites, arsenous\nacid, and arsenic(III) oxide, and it forms all four trihalides. Antimony forms\nantimony(III) oxide and antimonite but not oxyacids. Its trihalides, antimony\ntrifluoride, antimony trichloride, antimony tribromide, and antimony\ntriiodide, like all pnictogen trihalides, each have trigonal pyramidal\nmolecular geometry.\n\nThe +3 oxidation state is bismuth's most common oxidation state because its\nability to form the +5 oxidation state is hindered by relativistic properties\non heavier elements, effects that are even more pronounced concerning\nmoscovium. Bismuth(III) forms an oxide, an oxychloride, an oxynitrate, and a\nsulfide. Moscovium(III) is predicted to behave similarly to bismuth(III).\nMoscovium is predicted to form all four trihalides, of which all but the\ntrifluoride are predicted to be soluble in water. It is also predicted to form\nan oxychloride and oxybromide in the +III oxidation state.\n\n##### +5 oxidation state[edit]\n\nSee also: nitrate, phosphate, arsenate, antimonate, and bismuthate\n\nFor nitrogen, the +5 state is typically serves as only a formal explanation of\nmolecules like N_2O_5, as the high electronegativity of nitrogen causes the\nelectrons to be shared almost evenly.^[clarification needed] Pnictogen\ncompounds with coordination number 5 are hypervalent. Nitrogen(V) fluoride is\nonly theoretical and has not been synthesized. The \"true\" +5 state is more\ncommon for the essentially non-relativistic typical pnictogens phosphorus,\narsenic, and antimony, as shown in their oxides, phosphorus(V) oxide,\narsenic(V) oxide, and antimony(V) oxide, and their fluorides, phosphorus(V)\nfluoride, arsenic(V) fluoride, antimony(V) fluoride. They also form related\nfluoride-anions, hexafluorophosphate, hexafluoroarsenate,\nhexafluoroantimonate, that function as non-coordinating anions. Phosphorus\neven forms mixed oxide-halides, known as oxyhalides, like phosphorus\noxychloride, and mixed pentahalides, like phosphorus trifluorodichloride.\nPentamethylpnictogen(V) compounds exist for arsenic, antimony, and bismuth.\nHowever, for bismuth, the +5 oxidation state becomes rare due to the\nrelativistic stabilization of the 6s orbitals known as the inert-pair effect,\nso that the 6s electrons are reluctant to bond chemically. This causes\nbismuth(V) oxide to be unstable^[8] and bismuth(V) fluoride to be more\nreactive than the other pnictogen pentafluorides, making it an extremely\npowerful fluorinating agent.^[9] This effect is even more pronounced for\nmoscovium, prohibiting it from attaining a +5 oxidation state.\n\n##### Other oxidation states[edit]\n\n  * Nitrogen forms a variety of compounds with oxygen in which the nitrogen can take on a variety of oxidation states, including +II, +IV, and even some mixed-valence compounds and very unstable +VI oxidation state.\n  * In hydrazine, diphosphane, and organic derivatives of the two, the nitrogen or phosphorus atoms have the \u22122 oxidation state. Likewise, diimide, which has two nitrogen atoms double-bonded to each other, and its organic derivatives have nitrogen in the oxidation state of \u22121.\n\n    * Similarly, realgar has arsenic\u2013arsenic bonds, so the arsenic's oxidation state is +II.\n    * A corresponding compound for antimony is Sb_2(C_6H_5)_4, where the antimony's oxidation state is +II.\n  * Phosphorus has the +1 oxidation state in hypophosphorous acid and the +4 oxidation state in hypophosphoric acid.\n  * Antimony tetroxide is a mixed-valence compound, where half of the antimony atoms are in the +3 oxidation state, and the other half are in the +5 oxidation state.\n  * It is expected that moscovium will have an inert-pair effect for both the 7s and the 7p_1/2 electrons, as the binding energy of the lone 7p_3/2 electron is noticeably lower than that of the 7p_1/2 electrons. This is predicted to cause +I to be a common oxidation state for moscovium, although it also occurs to a lesser extent for bismuth and nitrogen.^[10]\n\n### Physical[edit]\n\nThe pnictogens exemplify the transition from nonmetal to metal going down the\nperiodic table: a gaseous diatomic nonmetal (N), two elements displaying many\nallotropes of varying conductivities and structures (P and As), and then at\nleast two elements that only form metallic structures in bulk (Sb and Bi;\nprobably Mc as well). All the elements in the group are solids at room\ntemperature, except for nitrogen which is gaseous at room temperature.\nNitrogen and bismuth, despite both being pnictogens, are very different in\ntheir physical properties. For instance, at STP nitrogen is a transparent non-\nmetallic gas, while bismuth is a silvery-white metal.^[11]\n\nThe densities of the pnictogens increase towards the heavier pnictogens.\nNitrogen's density is 0.001251 g/cm^3 at STP.^[11] Phosphorus's density is\n1.82 g/cm^3 at STP, arsenic's is 5.72 g/cm^3, antimony's is 6.68 g/cm^3, and\nbismuth's is 9.79 g/cm^3.^[12]\n\nNitrogen's melting point is \u2212210 \u00b0C and its boiling point is \u2212196 \u00b0C.\nPhosphorus has a melting point of 44 \u00b0C and a boiling point of 280 \u00b0C. Arsenic\nis one of only two elements to sublimate at standard pressure; it does this at\n603 \u00b0C. Antimony's melting point is 631 \u00b0C and its boiling point is 1587 \u00b0C.\nBismuth's melting point is 271 \u00b0C and its boiling point is 1564 \u00b0C.^[12]\n\nNitrogen's crystal structure is hexagonal. Phosphorus's crystal structure is\ncubic. Arsenic, antimony, and bismuth all have rhombohedral crystal\nstructures.^[12]\n\n### Nuclear[edit]\n\nAll pnictogens up to antimony have at least one stable isotope; bismuth has no\nstable isotopes, but has a primordial radioisotope with a half-life much\nlonger than the age of the universe (^209Bi); and all known isotopes of\nmoscovium are synthetic and highly radioactive. In addition to these isotopes,\ntraces of ^13N, ^32P, and ^33P occur in nature, along with various bismuth\nisotopes (other than ^209Bi) in the decay chains of thorium and uranium.\n\n## History[edit]\n\nThe nitrogen compound sal ammoniac (ammonium chloride) has been known since\nthe time of the Ancient Egyptians. In the 1760s two scientists, Henry\nCavendish and Joseph Priestley, isolated nitrogen from air, but neither\nrealized the presence of an undiscovered element. It was not until several\nyears later, in 1772, that Daniel Rutherford realized that the gas was indeed\nnitrogen.^[13]\n\nThe alchemist Hennig Brandt first discovered phosphorus in Hamburg in 1669.\nBrandt produced the element by heating evaporated urine and condensing the\nresulting phosphorus vapor in water. Brandt initially thought that he had\ndiscovered the Philosopher's Stone, but eventually realized that this was not\nthe case.^[13]\n\nArsenic compounds have been known for at least 5000 years, and the ancient\nGreek Theophrastus recognized the arsenic minerals called realgar and\norpiment. Elemental arsenic was discovered in the 13th century by Albertus\nMagnus.^[13]\n\nAntimony was well known to the ancients. A 5000-year-old vase made of nearly\npure antimony exists in the Louvre. Antimony compounds were used in dyes in\nthe Babylonian times. The antimony mineral stibnite may have been a component\nof Greek fire.^[13]\n\nBismuth was first discovered by an alchemist in 1400. Within 80 years of\nbismuth's discovery, it had applications in printing and decorated caskets.\nThe Incas were also using bismuth in knives by 1500. Bismuth was originally\nthought to be the same as lead, but in 1753, Claude Fran\u00e7ois Geoffroy proved\nthat bismuth was different from lead.^[13]\n\nMoscovium was successfully produced in 2003 by bombarding americium-243 atoms\nwith calcium-48 atoms.^[13]\n\n### Names and etymology[edit]\n\nThe term \"pnictogen\" (or \"pnigogen\") is derived from the ancient Greek word\n\u03c0\u03bd\u03af\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (pn\u00edgein) meaning \"to choke\", referring to the choking or stifling\nproperty of nitrogen gas.^[14] It can also be used as a mnemonic for the two\nmost common members, P and N. The term \"pnictogen\" was suggested by the Dutch\nchemist Anton Eduard van Arkel in the early 1950s. It is also spelled\n\"pnicogen\" or \"pnigogen\". The term \"pnicogen\" is rarer than the term\n\"pnictogen\", and the ratio of academic research papers using \"pnictogen\" to\nthose using \"pnicogen\" is 2.5 to 1.^[4] It comes from the Greek root \u03c0\u03bd\u03b9\u03b3-\n(choke, strangle), and thus the word \"pnictogen\" is also a reference to the\nDutch and German names for nitrogen (stikstof and Stickstoff, respectively,\n\"suffocating substance\": i.e., substance in air, unsupportive of breathing).\nHence, \"pnictogen\" could be translated as \"suffocation maker\". The word\n\"pnictide\" also comes from the same root.^[14]\n\nThe name pentels (from Greek \u03c0\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5, p\u00e9nte, five) also at one time stood for\nthis group.^[15]\n\n## Occurrence[edit]\n\nA collection of pnictogen samples\n\nNitrogen makes up 25 parts per million of the Earth's crust, 5 parts per\nmillion of soil on average, 100 to 500 parts per trillion of seawater, and 78%\nof dry air. Most nitrogen on Earth is in nitrogen gas, but some nitrate\nminerals exist. Nitrogen makes up 2.5% of a typical human by weight.^[citation\nneeded]\n\nPhosphorus is 0.1% of the earth's crust, making it the 11th most abundant\nelement. Phosphorus comprises 0.65 parts per million of soil and 15 to 60\nparts per billion of seawater. There are 200 Mt of accessible phosphates on\nearth. Phosphorus makes up 1.1% of a typical human by weight.^[13] Phosphorus\noccurs in minerals of the apatite family, which are the main components of the\nphosphate rocks.\n\nArsenic constitutes 1.5 parts per million of the Earth's crust, making it the\n53rd most abundant element. The soils hold 1 to 10 parts per million of\narsenic, and seawater carries 1.6 parts per billion of arsenic. Arsenic\ncomprises 100 parts per billion of a typical human by weight. Some arsenic\nexists in elemental form, but most arsenic is found in the arsenic minerals\norpiment, realgar, arsenopyrite, and enargite.^[13]\n\nAntimony makes up 0.2 parts per million of the earth's crust, making it the\n63rd most abundant element. The soils contain 1 part per million of antimony\non average, and seawater contains 300 parts per trillion on average. A typical\nhuman has 28 parts per billion of antimony by weight. Some elemental antimony\noccurs in silver deposits.^[13]\n\nBismuth makes up 48 parts per billion of the earth's crust, making it the 70th\nmost abundant element. The soils contain approximately 0.25 parts per million\nof bismuth, and seawater contains 400 parts per trillion of bismuth. Bismuth\nmost commonly occurs as the mineral bismuthinite, but bismuth also occurs in\nelemental form or sulfide ores.^[13]\n\nMoscovium is produced several atoms at a time in particle accelerators.^[13]\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n### Nitrogen[edit]\n\nNitrogen can be produced by fractional distillation of air.^[16]\n\n### Phosphorus[edit]\n\nThe principal method for producing phosphorus is to reduce phosphates with\ncarbon in an electric arc furnace.^[17]\n\n### Arsenic[edit]\n\nMost arsenic is prepared by heating the mineral arsenopyrite in the presence\nof air. This forms As_4O_6, from which arsenic can be extracted via carbon\nreduction. However, it is also possible to make metallic arsenic by heating\narsenopyrite at 650 to 700 \u00b0C without oxygen.^[18]\n\n### Antimony[edit]\n\nWith sulfide ores, the method by which antimony is produced depends on the\namount of antimony in the raw ore. If the ore contains 25% to 45% antimony by\nweight, then crude antimony is produced by smelting the ore in a blast\nfurnace. If the ore contains 45% to 60% antimony by weight, antimony is\nobtained by heating the ore, also known as liquidation. Ores with more than\n60% antimony by weight are chemically displaced with iron shavings from the\nmolten ore, resulting in impure metal.\n\nIf an oxide ore of antimony contains less than 30% antimony by weight, the ore\nis reduced in a blast furnace. If the ore contains closer to 50% antimony by\nweight, the ore is instead reduced in a reverberatory furnace.\n\nAntimony ores with mixed sulfides and oxides are smelted in a blast\nfurnace.^[19]\n\n### Bismuth[edit]\n\nBismuth minerals do occur, in particular in the form of sulfides and oxides,\nbut it is more economic to produce bismuth as a by-product of the smelting of\nlead ores or, as in China, of tungsten and zinc ores.^[20]\n\n### Moscovium[edit]\n\nMoscovium is produced a few atoms at a time in particle accelerators by firing\na beam of calcium-48 ions at americium-243 until the nuclei fuse.^[21]\n\n## Applications[edit]\n\n  * Liquid nitrogen is a commonly used cryogenic liquid.^[11]\n  * Nitrogen in the form of ammonia is a nutrient critical to most plants' survival.^[11] Synthesis of ammonia accounts for about 1\u20132% of the world's energy consumption and the majority of reduced nitrogen in food.\n  * Phosphorus is used in matches and incendiary bombs.^[11]\n  * Phosphate fertilizer helps feed much of the world.^[11]\n  * Arsenic was historically used as a Paris green pigment, but is not used this way anymore due to its extreme toxicity.^[11]\n  * Arsenic in the form of organoarsenic compounds is sometimes used in chicken feed.^[11]\n  * Antimony is alloyed with lead to produce some bullets.^[11]\n  * Antimony currency was briefly used in the 1930s in parts of China, but this use was discontinued as antimony is both soft and toxic.^[22]\n  * Bismuth subsalicylate is the active ingredient in Pepto-Bismol.^[11]\n  * Bismuth chalcogenides are being studied in cancerous mice as a candidate for use in improving radiation therapy in human cancer patients.^[23]\n  * Moscovium is too unstable and scarce to have any known practical application.\n\n## Biological role[edit]\n\nNitrogen is a component of molecules critical to life on earth, such as DNA\nand amino acids. Nitrates occur in some plants, due to bacteria present in the\nnodes of the plant. This is seen in leguminous plants such as peas\n^[clarification needed] or spinach and lettuce.^[citation needed] A typical 70\nkg human contains 1.8 kg of nitrogen.^[13]\n\nPhosphorus in the form of phosphates occur in compounds important to life,\nsuch as DNA and ATP. Humans consume approximately 1 g of phosphorus per\nday.^[24] Phosphorus is found in foods such as fish, liver, turkey, chicken,\nand eggs. Phosphate deficiency is a problem known as hypophosphatemia. A\ntypical 70 kg human contains 480 g of phosphorus.^[13]\n\nArsenic promotes growth in chickens and rats, and may be essential for humans\nin small quantities. Arsenic has been shown to be helpful in metabolizing the\namino acid arginine. There are 7 mg of arsenic in a typical 70 kg human.^[13]\n\nAntimony is not known to have a biological role. Plants take up only trace\namounts of antimony. There are approximately 2 mg of antimony in a typical 70\nkg human.^[13]\n\nBismuth is not known to have a biological role. Humans ingest on average less\nthan 20 \u03bcg of bismuth per day. There is less than 500 \u03bcg of bismuth in a\ntypical 70 kg human.^[13]\n\nMoscovium is too unstable to occur in nature or have a known biological role.\nMoscovium does not typically occur in organisms in any meaningful amount.\n\n### Toxicity[edit]\n\nNitrogen gas is completely non-toxic, but breathing in pure nitrogen gas is\ndeadly, because it causes nitrogen asphyxiation.^[22] The build-up of nitrogen\nbubbles in the blood, such as those that may occur during scuba diving, can\ncause a condition known as the \"bends\" (decompression sickness). Many nitrogen\ncompounds such as hydrogen cyanide and nitrogen-based explosives are also\nhighly dangerous.^[13]\n\nWhite phosphorus, an allotrope of phosphorus, is toxic, with 1 mg per kg\nbodyweight being a lethal dose.^[11] White phosphorus usually kills humans\nwithin a week of ingestion by attacking the liver. Breathing in phosphorus in\nits gaseous form can cause an industrial disease called \"phossy jaw\", which\neats away at the jawbone. White phosphorus is also highly flammable. Some\norganophosphorus compounds can fatally block certain enzymes in the human\nbody.^[13]\n\nElemental arsenic is toxic, as are many of its inorganic compounds; however\nsome of its organic compounds can promote growth in chickens.^[11] The lethal\ndose of arsenic for a typical adult is 200 mg and can cause diarrhea,\nvomiting, colic, dehydration, and coma. Death from arsenic poisoning typically\noccurs within a day.^[13]\n\nAntimony is mildly toxic.^[22] Additionally, wine steeped in antimony\ncontainers can induce vomiting.^[11] When taken in large doses, antimony\ncauses vomiting in a victim, who then appears to recover before dying several\ndays later. Antimony attaches itself to certain enzymes and is difficult to\ndislodge. Stibine, or SbH_3, is far more toxic than pure antimony.^[13]\n\nBismuth itself is largely non-toxic, although consuming too much of it can\ndamage the liver. Only one person has ever been reported to have died from\nbismuth poisoning.^[13] However, consumption of soluble bismuth salts can turn\na person's gums black.^[11]\n\nMoscovium is too unstable to conduct any toxicity chemistry.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Oxypnictide, including superconductors discovered in 2008\n  * Iron-based superconductor, ferropnictide and oxypnictide superconductors\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (2005).
