The pilot project has proved\nsuccessful in delivering alternative, privacy-friendly and user-focused social\nmedia platforms. It is time to review the results.\n\nOn 28 April 2022, the European Data Protection Supervisor launched a pilot\nproject featuring two social media platforms: EU Voice and EU Video. The two\nplatforms are part of the free, open-source and decentralised social media\nnetworks, based on Mastodon and PeerTube. Over the past two years, EU\ninstitutions, bodies, offices and agencies (EUIs) had the opportunity to\ncreate accounts on the platforms and connect with users registered in the\nFediverse, an online network of platforms and services interconnected with\neach other, including social media platforms.\n\nInitially due to run for one year, the pilot project of EU Voice and EU Video\nwas extended for a second year, due to its success amongst EUIs and its users.\nBy the end of the pilot project, EU Voice hosted 40 institutional accounts,\nincluding EU Commissioners and Members of the European Parliament, and EU\nVideo hosted 6 accounts, making EUIs the largest group of public bodies\npresent on the Fediverse globally.\n\nWojciech Wiewi\u00f3rowski, EDPS, said: \u201cThe EDPS pilot project of EU Voice and EU\nVideo has proved that public bodies, like EUIs, can offer social media\nplatforms that respect individuals\u2019 fundamental rights as alternatives to\ncommon platforms owned by a handful of big players. I am proud of the success\nof this project, especially considering the limited resources at our disposal.\nUnfortunately, despite our efforts to find a new home for EU Voice and EU\nVideo in other EUIs, we have been unable to secure new ownership to maintain\nthe servers and sustain operations at the high standards that EUIs and our\nusers deserve\u201d.\n\nThe EDPS\u2019 pilot project of EU Voice and EU Video proves that community-driven\nand decentralised social media platforms may prioritise users\u2019 fundamental\nrights to privacy and personal data, and foster the EU\u2019s digital sovereignty.\nThus, these platforms are possible tangible and viable alternatives to\ncommonly-used social media platforms. While this two-year pilot project\npresented challenges to secure continued support and dedicated resources, its\nlegacy serves as a testament that collaborative efforts, and solutions to\nshape a safer digital future for the EU are possible.\n\nThe EDPS will facilitate the required migration of EUIs who wish to keep their\naccounts active in the Fediverse, by providing the necessary support to ensure\na smooth transition to other platforms. EU Voice and EU Video will be\nofficially closed on 18 May 2024.\n\nFollowing the success of this pilot project, the EDPS remains committed to\nexploring innovative solutions that empower both public bodies and citizens in\nthe digital sphere.\n\nBackground information\n\nThe European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) is the independent supervisory\nauthority for the protection of personal data and privacy and promoting good\npractice in the EU institutions and bodies.\n\nThe EDPS\u2019 tasks include:\n\n  * monitoring the EU administration\u2019s processing of personal data;\n  * monitoring and advising technological developments on policies and legislation that affect privacy and personal data protection;\n  * carrying out investigations, including in the form of data protection audits/inspections;\n  * cooperating with other supervisory authorities to ensure consistency in the protection of personal\n\nFile size: 153.24 KB File type: pdf\n\nDownload\n\nAvailable languages: English\n\nEDPS-2024-08-EUVoice-EUVideo-end-of-story_EN.pdf\n\nTopics\n\nSocial Networks\n\n\\+ View more news\n\n## News\n\n### EDPS decentralised social media pilot: the end of a successful story\n\n26 April 2024\n\nAn important update on the EDPS' decentralised social media platforms EU Voice\nand EU Video.
