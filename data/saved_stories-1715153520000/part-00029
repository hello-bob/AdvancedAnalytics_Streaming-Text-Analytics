Think of exercise like a natural\nmood enhancer.\n\nWhen you move your body, your brain releases these feeling-good chemicals.\n\nAdditionally, exercising increases your brain\u2019s cognitive abilities,\nprotecting it from aging issues like dementia or memory loss.\n\nSo, I can\u2019t emphasize this enough that getting moving isn\u2019t just about staying\nfit; it has a more important purpose which is to keep your mind in top-notch\ncondition.\n\n> There are many research projects out there that shows exercise and body\n> movement is an effective treatment for depression.\n>\n> If you want to improve your mood and sustain your high performance, you have\n> no option but to include regular exercise and body movement sessions in your\n> schedule.\n>\n> This is not about achieving an arbitrary body weight or body size; it\u2019s all\n> about moving and stretching your muscles and having an increased heart rate\n> for some time.\n>\n> This can be running, cycling, swimming, going to the gym, doing yoga,\n> dancing, etc.\n\n### Top 5 Ways to Integrate Body Movement & Exercise into a Busy Life\n\n#### 1\\. Setting Reasonable Goals\n\nSetting goals isn\u2019t about becoming a fitness guru overnight.\n\nSe relaxed and easy-to-achieve goals for yourself \u2013 it won\u2019t last if you don\u2019t\nenjoy the journey.\n\n#### 2\\. Benefiting from a Buddy System\n\nHaving a workout buddy makes it more enjoyable compared to flying solo.\n\n#### 3\\. Creating a Positive Exercise Space\n\nWhether it\u2019s your room or a nearby park, it has to give you good vibes.\n\n#### 4\\. Celebrating Little Wins\n\nTo sustain a habit, it\u2019s important to be nice to yourself when you miss\nhitting your target and celebrate every small victory like it\u2019s a big deal.\n\nMake sure you don\u2019t use unhealthy habits as a reward for sustaining healthy\nhabits.\n\nIt\u2019s a very confusing strategy to reward yourself with a lot of ice cream on\nthe weekend (aka. unhealthy habit) after running for 20 minutes every day for\na week (aka. healthy habit).\n\n#### 5\\. Sneaking Exercise in Everyday Chores\n\nWhen life is super busy, exercise doesn\u2019t have to be a separate activity; it\ncan be a part of your daily chores.\n\nStretching or doing squats or planking while waiting for the water to boil can\nbe a decent exercise when you do it 3-5 times a day.\n\nWant to get Your Personalized Wellness Score for FREE?

No Time\n\nWhen life is busy, don\u2019t aim for a dedicated 1-hr exercise session.\n\nFocus on quick exercises and let them be like a fast snack for your body.\n\nIt\u2019s about finding small pockets in your day to stretch and move around.\n\n#### 2\\. Not Feeling It\n\nOne option is to put your favorite 10 songs in a playlist and allow yourself\nto listen to them only when you\u2019re exercising.\n\nThen even when you are NOT looking forward to that exercise session, you are\nfeeling a bit motivated to hear your favorite songs.\n\n#### 3\\. No Workout Buddies\n\nThink of it as your personal adventure.\n\nYou\u2019re the hero of your story, and you can conquer it on your own.\n\nIf you go to a gym for your exercise, when you show up consistently in a\nspecific time frame, you start noticing the same people over and over again\n(and they will start noticing you too).\n\nAnd that\u2019s how you can find your workout buddies.\n\n#### 4\\. Not Perfect at It\n\nOf course, you don\u2019t want to hurt yourself in the gym by doing an exercise in\na poor body position, but obsession with doing everything perfectly from Day 1\ncan make you dislike exercising all together.\n\nYou\u2019ll get better and better every day.\n\n> It\u2019s easy to exercise on a good day; it\u2019s difficult to do it on a bad day.\n>\n> As a rule of thumb, our body doesn\u2019t like to exercise or move when it needs\n> it the most.\n>\n> Sad feelings and depression are parasites that make you crave things that\n> feed them.\n>\n> It tells you if you stay in your bed all day, you\u2019re going to feel better.\n>\n> But it is just going to make you feel 10 times worse.\n>\n> If an exercise session feels like \u201ca lot,\u201d commit to 5-minute stretching\n> exercises because they can make you feel a bit better.\n\nAs a wrap up, it is important to remember that it\u2019s all about feeling good,\nimproving your mood, and sustaining your healthy high performance over time.\n\nWant to know how other professionals sustain their Healthy High Performance?\nPeriodically, we bring a group of professionals together and offer an online\ncourse.
