Dolphin Progress Report Tenth Anniversary Special: February, March, and April 2024\n\n## Dolphin Progress Report Tenth Anniversary Special: February, March, and\nApril 2024\n\nWritten by MayImilae, JMC47, mitaclaw, JosJuice, OatmealDome on April 30, 2024\n\n/ Last update on April 30, 2024 / Short link\n\nIn late 2012, Dolphin moved to a brand new website - dolphin-emu.org. With\ncomplete control of our own home and infrastructure for the first time, we\nnoticed the accessibility to users that it gave us. Not only did we get a new\nhome, but we also got a platform, one that allowed us to communicate directly\nto our users! We used it to great effect, explaining big changes to the\nemulator such as tev_fixes_new, getting ahead of controversy when we removed\nthe popular D3D9 graphics backend, calling out broken drivers, and more! The\nDolphin Blog was born!\n\nHowever, we quickly realized that while single dedicated articles were great\nfor big changes, Dolphin was improving all the time and tons of important\nand/or interesting changes were being overlooked simply because they weren't\n\"big enough\" to warrant a feature article. We needed something that would let\nus cover the continuing development of the emulator. Something like, a\nperiodical article filled with a collection of notable changes, so we could\nreport on the progress of Dolphin within a set window of time. And after much\nexperimentation, we built a format to fulfill this role, and released the\nfirst of its kind to the world on the 30th of April, 2014.\n\nTen years ago today, the first Dolphin Progress Report was launched! Since\nthen, our blog has exploded in popularity, and tens of thousands of people\nread every Report! And in that time, we've made 79 Dolphin Progress Reports,\nwith 797 Notable Changes, 54 special sections, and 301,807 words! Thanks for\nreading!\n\nAs the writers of the Dolphin blog, we are proud of what we have accomplished\nhere. We've highlighted tons of cool changes, educated our users (and\nourselves!) on how Dolphin works, we've helped reel in fresh talent for the\nemulator, we've helped people get into universities and launch their careers,\nand even helped a few people meet their life partners! Progress Reports have\nbeen so impactful, that they have reached far beyond Dolphin. The once novel\nconcept of emulator Progress Reports has become a standard means of user\ncommunication throughout emulation!\n\nBut of course, ten years is a long time, and we've changed along the way and\nwill continue to change over time. The Reports may grow or shrink, become more\nor less frequent, structure and style may change, and writers may come and go.\nAnd truth be told, this is hard, and we nearly reached the breaking point a\nfew times along the way. But no matter what happens, as the writers of the\nDolphin Blog, it is our goal and our hope that for as long there are Notable\nChanges being made to Dolphin, there will be Progress Reports to feature them!\n\nSpeaking of which, anniversary or not, this is a Progress Report. We have\nNotable Changes to cover! So without further ado, please enjoy the Tenth\nAnniversary Dolphin Progress Report, and the last Dolphin Progress Report of\nthe 5.0 era.\n\n### Surprise!\u00b6\n\nOK, a little further ado. We have prepared a little something to celebrate\nthis Anniversary. Enjoy!\n\nNow back to our regularly scheduled Dolphin Progress Report.\n\n### Notable Changes\u00b6\n\n#### 5.0-21264 - Core: Fix IPL device m_cursor overflow by JosJuice\u00b6\n\nIn March 2024, ElectrifiedStrawberry found a crash in Dolphin and drilled it\ndown to its root cause. GameCube software runs on the metal - it has absolute\ncontrol of the hardware without any operating system whatsoever. In order to\nsave console-wide settings, such as mono versus stereo audio, the GameCube\nstores 64 bytes of data in a battery-backed SRAM chip. Whenever a game boots,\nit will read the battery-backed SRAM and collect these settings without asking\nthe user to set stereo sound over and over again. Normally, games don't try to\nread or write beyond the 64 byte mark, but if they for some reason were to do\nthat, ElectrifiedStrawberry found that Dolphin would access memory beyond the\nend of the memory buffer it allocates for SRAM data.\n\nSeeing the report of this issue, JosJuice quickly realized that the bug might\nbe exploitable by specifically crafted software to take control of Dolphin,\nand fixed the problem by adding a bounds check. As far as we know, nobody has\ntried to exploit this bug yet, but to be on the safe side, we decided to\nrelease an out-of-schedule Beta release just a few days later to get the fix\nout to users.\n\nHow come one missing bounds check can open up for exploits of this magnitude?\nIf you've read about differences between different programming languages, one\nterm you might have come across is memory safety. Even the White House talked\nabout it recently! In a memory safe language, trying to access memory beyond\nthe end of a buffer or trying to access memory using a pointer that doesn't\neven point to valid memory to begin with is either impossible or handled in an\norderly way. For instance, Java raises an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException or\nNullPointerException respectively for these situations, and the programmer can\neither write code to handle these exceptions in whatever way they prefer, or\nignore the exceptions and have the program crash. But Dolphin is written in\nC++, which isn't memory safe. While nowadays there are languages that target\nboth memory safety and good performance, like Rust, back when Dolphin was\nstarted in 2003, all the available memory safe languages came with notable\nperformance penalties. And when emulating a cutting-edge console like the\nGameCube, you need all the performance you can get!\n\nIn C and C++, going beyond the end of a buffer or using an invalid pointer is\nformally undefined behavior, meaning literally anything could happen. In\npractice, usually one of two things happens. If you try to access memory that\nthe operating system considers to be invalid, the program normally crashes.\nWhile that may be unpleasant for the user, it's safe in the sense that there's\nno way for an attacker to exploit the behavior. On the other hand, if you try\nto access memory that the operating system thinks your program should be\nallowed to access... then the program accesses that memory. This is exactly\nwhat happens in the bug ElectrifiedStrawberry reported. If you go beyond the\nbuffer allocated for SRAM data, you'll start accessing other parts of\nDolphin's memory, which are valid memory regions but were never intended to be\naccessed by the emulated software! As mentioned before, we're not aware of\nanyone having created an exploit for this, but because Dolphin stores lots of\nimportant data after the SRAM buffer and because the emulated software can\nfreely mix reads and writes and can skip over addresses it isn't interested\nin, it's likely that it would be possible to create an exploit that escapes\nout of the emulated console.\n\nWhile in theory a program written in C or C++ can be memory safe if carefully\nwritten to avoid bugs, writing a large program without bugs occasionally\nslipping in is really, really hard, bordering on impossible. So unfortunately,\nthere's a risk of bugs like this being found lurking when someone unearths a\npart of Dolphin's code that hasn't been touched in a long time. But when bugs\nlike this are found, we take them seriously and move to fix them.\n\n#### 5.0-21145 - Improve window presentation at native resolution by Filoppi\u00b6\n\nLast year, Cristian64 noticed that there were black lines always present to\nthe right and bottom of the image whenever Dolphin was in Windowed mode. They\nlooked into it, and found some errors in how Dolphin's aspect ratio correction\ninteracts with our presentation. They posted their findings in our discord,\nFiloppi whipped up a fix, and that was merged in 5.0-20048. With that, the\ncursed black errant pixels were removed from the edges of the screen!\n\nFast forward to today, and Filoppi noticed that some titles at 1x Native were\nsofter than they should be.\n\nFour Swords Adventures was nice and crisp at 1x Native.But at some point,\nsomething was making it softer than it should be on the vertical axis.\n\nBisecting the issue, he traced it back to 5.0-20048, his own change! It turns\nout that the previous presentation fixes brought our old friend floating point\nrounding errors into the party! There are many opportunities for small\nfloating point rounding inaccuracies throughout Dolphin's presentation and\naspect ratio correction code, and sometimes (depending on the game and its\nnative resolution) these could add up to incorrectly make Dolphin think that\nscaling the image by one pixel was necessary. This was the cause of our\nblurring! Apparently the errant pixel borders Dolphin had previously were\naccidentally shielding Dolphin against this kind of error.\n\nSince realistically* there should never* be a case where scaling by a single\npixel is correct*, Filoppi fixed this with a simple exception - if Dolphin\ndecides to scale by a single pixel, pass through the unscaled image instead.\nProblem solved! Now Four Swords Adventures and any other affected games are\nproperly crisp at 1x Native once again.\n\n_* Next time on the Dolphin Progress Report...\n\n#### 5.0-21162 - BranchWatchDialog: A Total Replacement for CodeDiffDialog by\nmitaclaw\u00b6\n\nWhile Dolphin's primary purposes of preservation and enhancement are focused\non play, as an emulator we can grant DEEP access to GameCube and Wii hardware\nand software. Dolphin can be a powerful utility for GameCube and Wii modding\nand reverse engineering! This change adds a new debugging feature called the\nBranch Watch, a powerful new tool that enables better code searching than ever\nbefore!\n\nSince this is a feature by developers for developers, we're not going to hold\nback. Let's get technical!\n\nBack in April of 2022, the Code Diff Tool was added to the Code View widget.\nCreated by TryTwo and dreamsyntax, the Code Diff Tool aimed to replicate a\nfeature of the popular program Cheat Engine called \"Ultimap.\"\n\nWhat if you could do cheat searches, but on program flow? Ultimap is the way\nfor Windows applications.\n\nThe way the former Code Diff Tool worked was by recycling a JIT profiling\nfeature that had been inaccessible since the removal of DolphinWX in June of\n2018. By differencing the number of times a block of recompiled code has run\nsince the last time you checked, it was possible to track down sections of the\noriginal code that execute only when an action is performed in the emulated\nsoftware.\n\nUnfortunately, the recycled JIT profiling feature was in no way built for what\nthe Code Diff Tool was trying to do, leading to some limitations. The Code\nDiff Tool was not compatible with the Interpreter due to the Interpreter not\nbeing a JIT (obviously), nor was it compatible with the pseudo-JIT we call the\nCached Interpreter due to that JIT lacking the profiling feature. It was also\nsusceptible to JIT cache clears happening out of its control, interfering with\nprogress in any ongoing diff. For semi-arbitrary design reasons, the Code Diff\nTool required debugging symbols to operate. A diff would only include\nrecompiled blocks of code associated with the starting address of a debugging\nsymbol, which was problematic when the start of a function may never be\nrecompiled as its own block due to branch following optimizations in the\nJIT(s). Additionally, the same segment of the original code could be\nrecompiled multiple times, potentially resulting in misleading run counts.\nFinally, any changes to debugging symbols over the course of a diff would\ncause some diff results to be unrecognized when checking what has been run\nsince the last check.\n\nNaturally, these limitations were frustrating to work with, but it was\nmitaclaw who finally grew frustrated enough to try to do something about it.\nHe first set off to improve the Code Diff tool, but eventually he came to the\nconclusion that JIT profiling data wouldn't cut it any more; Dolphin needed a\nnew component built for the purpose. Thus, the Branch Watch was born.\n\nThe job of the Branch Watch is to receive information from the emulated CPU\nabout every executed branch's origin, destination, and PowerPC instruction. It\nalso receives implicit information about the current address translation mode\nas well as if a conditional branch is taking its true path or false path.\nAfter an optimized associative lookup, an entry added to or found in one of\nthe BranchWatch's \"Collection\" containers will have its hit count incremented\nby one. From the user-facing Branch Watch Tool, it is then possible to direct\nthe Branch Watch to perform some differencing (not unlike the former Code Diff\nTool would) to collate references to the \"Collection\" containers' entries that\nmeet a given criteria into a separate list - the BranchWatch's \"Selection\"\ncontainer. This \"Selection\" container is what can be seen in the user-facing\nBranch Watch Tool. The whole process makes viewing the information\nsufficiently thread-safe, allowing for real-time updates (every 100 ms) to the\nBranch Watch Tool's interface.\n\nImplementing all of this was a breeze for the interpreter, and support\nnaturally came to the Cached Interpreter as it's barely a JIT. Support for the\nproper JITs was not so simple. A branch might not be recompiled at all due to\nthe aforementioned branch following optimization. The JITs also have idle loop\ndetection, which can cause specific branches to be recompiled differently. The\nx86_64 JIT also supports merging PowerPC comparison instructions and PowerPC\nconditional branch instructions into a single x86_64 instruction that does\nboth. The most involved JIT-ism to support was an optimization for a looping\npattern commonly seen when invalidating memory with the dcbx family of\ninstructions. After relentlessly hunting down every corner case, and with\nJosJuice's invaluable guidance on writing safe recompiler code, the JITs were\nfinally able to match the Interpreter perfectly.\n\nSo many buttons and boxes... where to begin?\n\nThe new Branch Watch Tool comes with a robust set of options and features to\nempower code searching. It is possible to filter candidate branches by address\nand debugging symbol (both at the origin and destination), by true path or\nfalse path (for conditional branches), and even by 12 different instruction\nkinds. When replacing a tool with existing users, it's imperative to leave no\nfeature behind. The authors of the former Code Diff Tool were given council to\nmake sure features from the former Code Diff Tool were not forgotten, such as\nsaving and loading in-progress searches (including an auto-save feature) and\n\"inspecting\" results by modifying instructions to stub functionality\n(previously done inspections are marked with a bold red font). All-in-all, the\nnew Branch Watch Tool should be able to satisfy everyone by providing a\nsuperset of features previously available.\n\nIf you would like to take the new Branch Watch Tool for a spin, look for the\n\"Branch Watch\" button in the Code View widget and check out the Branch Watch\nTool's help message tutorial found under Tool > Help. As an aside for non-\ndebugging users, we assure you that this new feature should have zero\nperformance implications for recompiled code when not in use.\n\n#### 5.0-21164 - Corrected Custom Aspect Ratio by Filoppi\u00b6\n\nThe previous Progress Report saw the introduction of the Custom Aspect Ratio\nsetting, allowing users to set any arbitrary aspect ratio they want! However,\nwe ended that section by warning that the new Custom aspect ratio option\nbypassed our aspect ratio corrections, and the image would be slightly\ndistorted basically all the time.\n\nFortunately, Filoppi wasn't through with this feature, and the custom aspect\nratio setting now has Dolphin's aspect ratio corrections! If you are using an\nultra-wide screen code, you can just set a Custom Aspect Ratio to match your\nscreen and/or code and it will just work, without need to worry about or\ncompensate for subtle aspect ratio issues!\n\nHowever, if you liked the old behavior, you can use the new \"Custom (Stretch)\"\noption, which still does not have any aspect ratio correction.\n\n#### 5.0-21194 - Implement IR passthrough for Emulated Wii Remotes by\nAdmiralCurtiss\u00b6\n\nEver since Dolphin added its own Wii Remote driver that allowed for using the\nWii Remote as a configurable controller in Dolphin, one of the biggest\nquestions has been \"When is Infrared Support coming?\" Dolphin's Wii Remote\ndriver could do just about anything with the Wii Remote, include using it to\nsimulate almost all Wii Remote functions and even passthrough the battery\nlevel to the emulated game. But, when it came to infrared, there was no way to\nproperly handle it on a standard Wii Remote, and you'd be forced to use the\n\"Real Wii Remote\" setting or Bluetooth Passthrough if you wanted to use a\nsensor bar for infrared data.\n\n\"Connect Wii Remotes for Emulated Controllers\" uses Dolphin's very own Wii\nRemote driver to give the machine a mappable controller.\n\n\"Point Passthrough\" is a new feature for Dolphin's Wii Remote driver that\nallows you to use a real sensor bar with the emulated Wii Remote option.\n\nSome of you may be scratching your head after reading that, as there is a way\nto get the Wii Remote pointer working with Dolphin's Wii Remote driver.\nHowever, that method of getting the pointer working doesn't use infrared at\nall, it simply simulates the Wii Remote's pointer direction using the\nMotionPlus gyro (and is compatible with non-Wii Remotes that have a gyro) and\nuses that to reasonably simulate the controller's position in 3D space, from\nwhich Dolphin can calculate where the Wii Remote is pointing. This is what\nlets players easily play games like Super Mario Galaxy on modern controllers\nwith gyro capabilities.\n\nThere are some limitations to this, and people with Wii Remote hardware have\nlong been asking for real infrared support with our Wii Remote driver. Unlike\nreal infrared, which has a physical reference in space, gyro infrared suffers\nfrom drifting and you have to manually recenter it (usually with a button\ncombo on the controller) once in a while. In most games this isn't too bad,\nbut if you're doing a lot of rapid movements, gyro aiming can fall apart fast!\nThere are also some cases where the gyro simulation didn't produce accurate\nenough results. Here are some of the best examples where infrared support\nmakes a big difference.\n\n##### Features\u00b6\n\n  * Netplay - In netplay, only emulated controllers can be used due to the strict requirement of absolute determinism. This means you cannot fall back to using the \"Real Wii Remote\" or the Bluetooth Passthrough settings. However, since 5.0-11684 physical Wii Remotes were still usable on netplay through connecting Wii Remotes for emulated controllers. A lack of infrared support meant that using a real Wii Remote on netplay had the hard requirement of having MotionPlus if you were using the pointer. This also meant any game that requires precise pointer controls would not work. We'll have some examples later.\n\n  * Savestates - Saving the state of the emulator is always a perilous task. Each of Dolphin's methods of handling Wii Remotes affects savestates differently.\n\n    * Bluetooth Passthrough makes things very difficult, because we use a real hardware Bluetooth Adapter directly - and we cannot save the state of that physical device. There is limited savestate support, but it requires the user to get the adapter to match the state it was in when the savestate was made. You could accomplish this by connecting the same Wii Remotes in the same order with the same attachments and hope that Wii Remotes are using the same reporting mode as when the savestate was made. Otherwise? It'll deadlock.\n\n    * Real Wii Remotes aren't as bad, but users aren't exactly thrilled by our softlock workarounds. As mentioned above, Wii Remotes have various reporting modes, and because we're dealing with a physical device outside of the emulator, we can't simply restore it to the state it was in when the savestate was made. In order to prevent potential softlocks with Wii Remotes, Dolphin will disconnect and reconnect Wii Remotes on loadstate. This resets the state of the Wii Remote to ensure they match, but results in a small delay on loadstate and the game potentially complaining that the controller was disconnected. It may sound annoying, but it is also greatly increases the stability of savestates for Wii games.\n\n    * Emulated Wii Remotes have none of these problems, as the thing the game is directly communicating with is within Dolphin's ecosystem. This means that Dolphin can just restore the state of the emulated Wii Remote, without the need for any workarounds or mitigations for softlocks. This is because the \"physical\" controller just communicating through our driver to our emulated controller. With the new Point (Passthrough) feature, you can get the full benefits of a real sensor bar and savestates all at once. Perfect for speedrun practice or getting past a difficult pointer puzzle.\n\n##### Game Specific\u00b6\n\n  * Super Paper Mario - This game in particular asks a lot of the Pointer, having you swap between pointing at the screen and pointing off screen. Gyro Point struggles with pointing far off screen, so oftentimes users would have to map the hotkey \"hide pointer\" in order to get the game to behave in a reasonable manner. With a real sensor bar, it just works.\n\n  * The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword - This is a rather funny case that really messes with our Gyro Pointer. Skyward Sword already uses the gyro for its pointer, using infrared only for a reference point and for active recalibration to combat drift during play. This means when Dolphin is using the gyro to generate the pointer position, Skyward Sword is using our emulated point in space to correct for gyro drift, yet our emulated point in space is from the same gyro that it is trying to recalibrate. Calibrating a gyro to itself results in a lot of wonky pointer behavior, but users have made it work with complex control schemes and copious recentering. Using a real sensor bar with emulated Wii Remotes gets the game behaving just as it does on the Real Wii Remote options.\n\n  * Trauma Center, Another Code R, WarioWare: Smooth Moves and other precision pointer games - Unlike the other situations, there wasn't an easy workaround for these games when using Gyro Point. These games have various levels where you're required to push the Wii Remote toward the screen or pull it away from the screen. While games can use the accelerometer for this, they also use the sensor bar's two clusters of lights as a reference point. When you push the Wii Remote closer, the two clusters separate more, and that's how the game can tell the Wii Remote is closer to the screen. Gyro Point has no way of handling this currently, and the only way to make this work without a real sensor bar is to map a bunch of emulated movements to the controller. While this is possible, you get a very different experience and using a real sensor bar keeps it simple and authentic.\n\n##### Limitations\u00b6\n\nWith this major update to the emulated Wii Remotes, the bridge between Real\nWii Remotes and Emulated Wii Remotes shrinks further. Considering that we\nstill have three different ways of connecting Wii Remotes, one may question\nwhen it'd be time to simplify things. Unfortunately, Emulated Wii Remotes\nstill have a few shortcomings that make Real Wii Remotes a necessary option.\n\nWhile things like battery life work, unfortunately physical Wii Remote\nSpeakers aren't supported on the Emulated Wii Remote. Many users (and\ndevelopers) may argue speaker data doesn't work properly even on Real Wii\nRemote, but one feature that is definitely missing on Emulated Wii Remotes is\nthe Wii Remote Eeprom. This Eeprom could store a small amount of data, usually\nfor Miis. Real Wii Remote does support this, but this might be very\ncomplicated to support within our driver.\n\nIf you want to try out infrared support, it's automatically mapped correctly\nwhen loading Dolphin's default Wii Remote profile. To try it out, go to the\nMotion Input tab and disable the standard \"Point\" setting that uses the Gyro,\nand enable Point (Passthrough). That will allow you to use your real sensor\nbar.\n\nThe settings may look complicated, but Dolphin will set everything up itself\nto work with your Wii Remote.\n\n#### HDR Enhancements: 5.0-19931 - Add AutoHDR post process shader by Filoppi\nand 5.0-21232 - Add HDR to Metal + Perceptual HDR by samb\u00b6\n\nHDR is currently very challenging to demonstrate in browsers. Frustrated, the\nblog authors resorted to old memes. We apologize in advance.\n\nSeveral months ago, Filoppi's 5.0-19716 - Support Accurate NTSC/PAL Color\nSpaces was merged, which gave Dolphin the ability to properly emulate the\ngamma and color space of the GameCube and Wii. The difference isn't\nsignificant, and since it results in slightly reduced brightness and\nsaturation it could be considered undesirable, hence it being off by default.\nBut more accuracy is more accuracy, and even subtle improvements are important\nfor a mature emulator such as Dolphin!\n\nHowever, to facilitate accurate gamma and color spaces, Dolphin needed more\ncontrol over the host display. Ironically, this required Dolphin to support\nHDR. High Dynamic Range is typically used to display a larger color space, yet\nthis feature was using it to limit the color space to accurate levels.\nRegardless of the reasoning, this change added the HDR Post-Processing feature\nto Dolphin.\n\nWhat happened next was easy to see coming.\n\nIn 5.0-19928, Filoppi added an HDR enhancement shader to Dolphin! A \"slimmed\ndown port\" of Filoppi's prior Reshade shader, our AutoHDR shader is designed\nto be additive - it expands highlights into HDR luminance while leaving the\nrest of the image unmodified. This gives games a bit more pop while still\nmostly maintaining their original SDR look.\n\nAutoHDR has several options to allow users to dial in the experience.\n\n  * Shoulder Pow - Modulates the Auto HDR highlights curve. Low values bleed a bit into midtones to give a gentle, soft edge around the HDRified highlights, while high values only brighten the hightlights for pin sharp edges.\n  * Shoulder Start Alpha - Determines how bright the source SDR color needs to be before it can be used to generate fake HDR highlights\n  * HDR Display Max Nits - Sets the maximum brightness of the HDR highlights\n\nIf you want to closely follow the original look of the game but add a little\nHDR pop, AutoHDR is for you! Do note however that GameCube and Wii games have\nvery primitive lighting models, more primitive than what AutoHDR was\noriginally designed for. More often than not, our AutoHDR shader will benefit\nfrom tweaking for each individual game's lighting quirks.\n\nFor a bit more pop, samb's 5.0-21232 brings PerceptualHDR, a much more HDRy\nenhancement option! PerceptualHDR uses a logarithmic approach to its inverse\ntonemapping curve. This results in brightness and saturation scaling that\nlooks more \"natural\" to the eye, though less accurate. It also has the side\neffect of making it very tolerant of the poor lighting models of GameCube and\nWii titles, and reducing the need for customization! It also has higher\nsaturation and brightness overall, with a more \"HDR look\". However,\nPerceptualHDR significantly changes the look of the game, and is definitely\nnot for those pursuing accuracy.\n\nThe two shaders have very different looks and goals, neither one is \"better\"\nthan the other. AutoHDR is very conservative, trying to enhance but respect\nthe original look. Plus it is very customizable, allowing it to adapt to any\ngame's lighting. Meanwhile, PerceptualHDR throws out the original look for all\nthe HDR pop it can offer! While it is generally more tolerant, it is also not\ncustomizable (outside of amplification), so if a game doesn't work well with\nit you're basically out of luck, but AutoHDR can be adjusted to match.\nWhichever shader you use is up to you and what you'd like out of an HDR\nenhancement!\n\nTo demonstrate these differences, we're going to need to go into the High\nDynamic Range!\n\n##### HDR Block\u00b6\n\nClick the image below to enter the HDR Block, an addendum article where we use\ncutting edge browser features to show you actual HDR comparisons rendered in\nyour very own browser!\n\nYou'll need an HDR display to see the differences, so if you are using an SDR\ndisplay, feel free to skip.\n\nCLICK THE IMAGE BELOW TO ENTER THE WORLD OF\n\nWelcome back to the land of SDR! Take a moment to readjust your eyes if you\nneed to. Maybe use some eyedrops.\n\nNow that we have established the differences and options, it's time for us to\ntemper your expectations.\n\nThe GameCube and Wii are entirely SDR consoles with very basic lighting models\nthat were designed for small and dim displays. They are absolutely not\ndesigned for HDR. By dragging them kicking and screaming into high dynamic\nrange, we are putting these games that have no idea what HDR is in charge of\nan absurdly powerful display technology.\n\nOur HDR enhancements are not magic. Expect quirks and problems.\n\nFor example, there is no concept of \"paper-white\" in these games. While our\nHDR enhancement shaders differ in their approach and the inverse tone mapping\nof middle values, the extremes are the same - complete black in SDR space will\nbe complete black in HDR space, and complete white in SDR space will be the\nmaximum HDR output of the shader or your display. If you crank your display\nbrightness to the max, turn on an enhancement shader and crank it to the max,\nand launch a game that has an entirely white screen, you could be bombarded\nwith thousands of nits of brightness. And guess what console starts every\nsingle game with a solid white screen - the Nintendo Wii!\n\nWhen MayImilae first tested PerceptualHDR, she maxed out her display\nbrightness and the amplification setting, then launched a Wii title. This was\nher experience.\n\nYou can easily flashbang yourself with these features, so use this power\nresponsibly.\n\nFurthermore, if you are using an HDR display without calibrating it, any time\nyou view SDR content you are already experiencing inverse tone mapping. Most\ncurrent generation displays, televisions and phones especially, don't care\nabout accurate SDR recreation and by default boost saturation and brightness\nway beyond SDR spec. They are already turning SDR content into HDR content by\ndefault!\n\nAs such, you may turn on AutoHDR or PerceptualHDR and see a dimmer and duller\nappearance than you had without any HDR enhancements. If this occurs, our HDR\nenhancements' inverse tone mapping is more conservative than what you are used\nto!\n\nThe world of HDR is a varied and wild place. With \"HDR\" spanning everything\nfrom 300 nits peak brightness to 10,000, and from 8-bit dithered 50% DCI-P3 to\n12-bit 100% Rec2020 reference monsters, HDR can be very different things\ndepending on your display. Our HDR enhancements add to your existing tools for\ncustomizing inverse tone mapping on your HDR display, and you will need to use\nall of the tools available to you for best results. HDR is like that.\n\nThat being said, if you are ok with experimenting, HDR has a lot to offer as\nan enhancement. When everything lines up, these HDR enhancements can improve\nthe game's visuals on a scale similar to raising internal resolution! Games\nlike Super Mario Galaxy and Sonic Colors look great with these enhancements!\nHDR is messy and complicated and a pain, but when everything lines up and it\nworks correctly, there is nothing quite like it.\n\nWhile our Post-Processing shaders will appear on all platforms, our HDR Post-\nProcessing feature is currently only available in our desktop Qt interface,\nand requires HDR to work. Functionally, that means that currently our HDR\nenhancements can only be used on Windows, macOS, and a tiny subset of Linux\n(that includes the Steam Deck OLED).\n\nTo use these shaders, have an HDR screen and enable HDR. Then turn on HDR\nPost-Processing...And select an HDR Post-Processing Shader!\n\nHDR Post-Processing is currently not available on Android.\n\n#### 5.0-21253 - Implement Modem Adapter by fuzziqersoftware\u00b6\n\nThe GameCube was released in the early days of the ubiquitous internet. In\n2001, dial-up was still a normal way to go online, but broadband was\nincreasingly spreading its tendrils throughout the globe, and our chronically-\nonline doom-scrolling future was already well on its way to consuming us all.\nTo facilitate experimenting with this terrifying new frontier, the GameCube\nhad an accessory port on the bottom that could fit the GameCube BroadBand\nAdapter (BBA), a 10/100mbps ethernet adapter that allowed the GameCube entry\nto the information superhighway!\n\nThe BroadBand Adapter Instruction Booklet walked users through the arduous\ninstallation process.\n\nSince it was an addon accessory for an experimental feature, it saw limited\nsupport in the GameCube lineup. Some games used the BBA for its LAN mode,\nallowing players to connect multiple GameCubes together locally for crazy high\nplayer numbers while avoiding that whole scary internet thing. But a select\nfew games dove right into the Online mode, requiring an internet adapter and\nan internet connection! The iconic Phantasy Star Online MMO franchise survived\nthe fall of the Dreamcast this way.\n\nHowever, while the BBA is reasonably well known amoungst GameCube enthusiasts,\nthere was another accessory that could go into that port - The GameCube Modem\nAdapter. This was a 56kbps dial-up modem alternative to the BBA. While it\nlacked the LAN mode, the Modem Adapter granted more or less the same online\nfeatures as the BroadBand Adapter, just... worse. All online-mode games that\nsupported the BroadBand Adapter also supported the Modem Adapter, so users\nwere expected to just pick the internet adapter that matched their connection\nand access the same online content. Though, with some mild variation in user\nexperience.\n\nExcept, for one game. There is one game that requires the GameCube Modem\nAdapter, and does not work with the BroadBand Adapter! This game is Phantasy\nStar Online Episode I & II Trial Edition. The final version of PSO I & II\nsupports the BBA, but its Trial does not. Dolphin only supported the BroadBand\nAdapter, so for the entirety of Dolphin's existence, PSO I & II Trial Edition\nrequired game modification to be playable in Dolphin!\n\nThis change resolves that. fuzziqersoftware, a developer behind PSO reverse\nengineering tools and PSO custom servers, has implemented tapserver-based\nModem Adapter emulation in Dolphin! By combining modem adapter emulation with\na compatible custom server, Phantasy Star Online Episode I & II Trial Edition\nis playable in Dolphin for the very first time without action replay codes or\ngame patches!\n\nNot only is this a win for preservation of this interesting era of GameCube\nhardware and PSO development, it's also a mark off the very short list of\nGameCube games that cannot be played in Dolphin without modification.\n\n#### 5.0-21345 - JitCache: Software Profiling Restoration by mitaclaw\u00b6\n\nAs was mentioned earlier in this Progress Report, software JIT profiling is\none of a small group of debug features left inaccessible by the transition\nfrom DolphinWX to DolphinQt. The underlying feature had a partial return as\nthe component powering the Code Diff Tool, before that tool was replaced with\nthe Branch Watch Tool shown previously. Following this, mitaclaw decided he\nmust restore software JIT profiling to its former glory - it's the least he\ncould do after leaving it abandoned once again. It's unlikely this feature\nwill have many users, even among Dolphin's developers, but it's good to see an\nold feature get rekindled rather than extinguished.\n\nHere it is resurrected in DolphinQt.And for the first time, Android!\n\n### Last Month's Contributors...\u00b6\n\nSpecial thanks to all of the contributors that incremented Dolphin from\n5.0-21090 through to 5.0-21460!\n\n### Social Media Update\u00b6\n\nWe are now maintaining three social media presences: Mastodon, Bluesky, and\nTwitter!\n\nThe content on these accounts will largely mirror each other. Our Mastodon is\nour flagship social media presence, it is strongly under our control\n(literally living on our servers) and truest to our open source philosophy.\nTwitter is our oldest account, with over a decade of history! Hopefully that\nwill continue. And finally, our Bluesky is brand new! Feel free to follow us\non whichever you'd like!\n\n### Why Dolphin Isn\u2019t Coming to the iOS App Store\u00b6\n\nIn early April, Apple shocked the emulation community by updating their App\nStore Guidelines to permit retro game console emulators on the App Store.\nWhile there was some initial debate over whether the new guidelines only\npermitted \"officially-developed\" emulators, community-made emulators soon\nbegan appearing on the App Store. The floodgates were open.\n\nEver since this happened, one question we've been frequently asked is \"when\nwill Dolphin come to the App Store?\"\n\nUnfortunately, due to other restrictions set by Apple, we are not able to\nrelease Dolphin on the App Store. This also applies to app marketplaces in\nEurope, like AltStore PAL.\n\nThe GameCube and Wii both use a PowerPC-based CPU, while most modern devices\nuse x86-64 (Intel & AMD) and AArch64 (ARM) based processors. To be able to run\nGameCube and Wii machine code, Dolphin uses a Just-in-Time (JIT) recompiler to\ntranslate it into code that our modern CPUs can understand. This works well on\nall of our supported platforms.\n\nThere's just one problem: Apple does not allow third-party apps to use JIT\nrecompilers on iOS and iPadOS.\n\nDolphin does have both the Interpreter and Cached Interpreter, which are JIT-\nless methods for emulating the CPU. However, they are many times slower than\nDolphin's JITs, making them unusable for actually playing games.\n\nClick to see our Cached Interpreter race our JIT on an iPhone 15 Pro Max! _For\nlonger versions of these videos with sound: Interpreter, JIT\n\nThere is one very narrow exception to the \"no JIT\" rule on iOS - alternative\nweb browsers in Europe. This is because many web browsing engines utilize JITs\nto speed up JavaScript execution. As allowing alternative browsers is required\nin Europe under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), Apple gave these apps a special\nexemption in iOS 17.4. However, Dolphin is not a web browser, and Apple has\nvery specific requirements that they use to check whether an app is really a\nweb browser or not. JITs in web browsers are also subject to additional\nsecurity requirements, such as separating the JIT into its own isolated and\nlocked down process. This is extremely problematic for Dolphin, which expects\neverything to be included in one process. While retooling Dolphin to work\nwithin these constraints is theoretically possible, it would require a large\narchitectural redesign and a significant amount of effort just for one\nplatform. Apple may also just choose to ban our app in the end anyways for\npretending to be a web browser.\n\nAfter reading about web browsers being able to use JIT recompilers, you may be\nwondering \"why not just make a version of Dolphin that runs in a web browser?\"\nWell, easier said than done! To make a usable web version of Dolphin, someone\nwould need to write a brand new JIT targeting WebAssembly and add WebGL\nsupport to our OpenGL video backend. While we don't want to say that a web\nversion of Dolphin is completely impossible, working on one just isn't in any\nof our plans at the moment.\n\nAnother suggestion we've received is that we should use ahead-of-time\ncompilation (AOT) on these platforms. This would involve re-compiling all of a\ngame's code to AArch64 in advance, which lets us avoid having to generate the\ncode on the actual device with a JIT. Unfortunately, having to rely solely on\nAOT compilation would likely cause several compatibility problems. These\nissues largely stem from the fact that games are freely able to self-modify\ntheir code. Some EA games, for example, store their code compressed on disc,\nand then decompress it at runtime. Other games are even able to generate\nentirely new code with a JIT of their own! The official Nintendo 64 emulator\nused in Virtual Console releases is one notable example of this, as it\nincludes a JIT for emulation of the Nintendo 64's MIPS-based CPU. Since we\naren't able to know with certainty what code will be executed before the game\nruns, it isn't feasible to use an AOT recompiler as the sole method for\nemulating the CPU.\n\nAs such, barring Apple having another sudden change of heart or some other\nmiracle, an iOS App Store release is off the table for Dolphin.\n\n#### Blog series\n\nThis article is number 80 within the blog series Dolphin Progress Report. \u2039\nPrevious article in series\n\n#### Tags\n\n  * BBA\n  * Graphics\n  * HDR\n  * Wiimote\n  * bugfix\n  * controller\n  * iPhone\n  * netplay\n  * new feature\n  * progress report\n  * technical\n  * video\n\n#### Categories\n\nNo categories\n\n### Previous entry\n\nDolphin Progress Report: November and December 2023, January 2024\n\n### Similar entries\n\n  * Dolphin Progress Report: July, August, and September 2020\n  * Dolphin Progress Report: December 2018 and January 2019\n  * Dolphin Progress Report: February and March 2020\n  * Dolphin Progress Report: February 2017\n  * Dolphin Progress Report: July 2015\n\n#### Blog tags\n\n  * 3d\n  * 4.0\n  * 5.0\n  * 60FPS\n  * Accessory\n  * adreno\n  * amd\n  * Analysis\n  * android\n  * announcement\n  * arm\n  * ARM\n  * audio\n  * ax-hle\n  * BBA\n  * bigfix\n  * bounding box\n  * bug\n  * bugfix\n  * cheats\n  * Cheats\n  * CI\n  * Commemoration\n  * community\n  * controller\n  * D3D\n  * D3D9\n  * Datel\n  * Devdiary\n  * DevDiary\n  * discord\n  * Disney Trio of Destruction\n  * driver\n  * DS\n  * dsp-hle\n  * dvd timings\n  * Factor5\n  * Feature Removal\n  * Foundation\n  * gamebug\n  * GameCube\n  * Gamehacks\n  * GBA\n  * gpu\n  * Graphics\n  * Hardware\n  * HD\n  * HDR\n  * hle\n  * homebrew\n  * intel\n  * iPhone\n  * JIT\n  * Legal\n  * Licensing\n  * linking\n  * mac\n  * macOS\n  * mali\n  * memory card\n  * mesa\n  * Metal\n  * miniupdate\n  * mod\n  * multiplayer\n  * netplay\n  * Netplay\n  * new feature\n  * nvidia\n  * OGL\n  * Online-play\n  * passthrough\n  * Patches\n  * performance\n  * progress report\n  * Qt\n  * qualcomm\n  * release\n  * releasecandidate\n  * rendering\n  * Review\n  * shieldtv\n  * Software Renderer\n  * sonic\n  * speedrun\n  * Steam\n  * Steam Deck\n  * stereo\n  * stereoscopy\n  * tas\n  * technical\n  * ubershaders\n  * Ubisoft\n  * ui\n  * Unlicensed\n  * updater\n  * video\n  * vulkan\n  * Wii\n  * WiiConnect24\n  * wiimote\n  * Wiimote\n  * Wind Waker\n  * wx\n  * XFB\n  * zelda\n\n#### Blog series\n\n  * Dolphin Progress Report\n  * HLE Audio\n\nSee all \u00bb\n\n\u00a9 Dolphin Emulator Project - Website Source Code - Privacy Policy Mastodon\nverification\n\n# dolphin-emu.org asks for your consent to use your personal data to:\n\n  * perm_identity\n\nPersonalised advertising and content, advertising and content measurement,\naudience research and services development\n\n  * devices\n\nStore and/or access information on a device\n\n  * How can I change my choice?\n\n  * What if I don't consent?\n\n  * How does legitimate interest work?\n\n  * Do I have to consent to everything?\n\nYour personal data will be processed and information from your device\n(cookies, unique identifiers, and other device data) may be stored by,\naccessed by and shared with 136 TCF vendor(s) and 62 ad partner(s), or used\nspecifically by this site or app.\n\nSome vendors may process your personal data on the basis of legitimate\ninterest, which you can object to by managing your options below.
