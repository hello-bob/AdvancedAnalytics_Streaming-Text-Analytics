Without such access, cops fear they won't be\nable to prevent \"the most heinous of crimes\" like terrorism, human\ntrafficking, child sexual abuse material (CSAM), murder, drug smuggling and\nother crimes.\n\n\"Our societies have not previously tolerated spaces that are beyond the reach\nof law enforcement, where criminals can communicate safely and child abuse can\nflourish,\" the declaration said. \"They should not now.\"\n\nThe joint statement, which was agreed to in cooperation with the UK's National\nCrime Agency, isn't exactly making a novel claim. It's nearly the same line of\nreasoning that the Virtual Global Taskforce, an international law enforcement\ngroup founded in 2003 to combat CSAM online, made last year when Meta first\nfirst started talking about implementing E2EE on Messenger and Instagram.\n\nWhile not named in this latest declaration itself [PDF], Europol said that its\nopposition to E2EE \"comes as end-to-end encryption has started to be rolled\nout across Meta's messenger platform.\" The UK NCA made a similar statement in\nits comments on the Europol missive released over the weekend.\n\nThe declaration urges the tech industry not to see user privacy as a binary\nchoice, but rather as something that can be assured without depriving law\nenforcement of access to private communications.\n\n  * Meta, Twitter, Apple, Google urged to up encryption game in post-Roe America\n  * Cooler heads needed in heated E2EE debate, says think tank\n  * Privacy and computer security are too important to be left to political meddling\n  * UK Online Safety Bill to become law \u2013 and encryption busting clause is still there\n\n\"We ... call on the technology industry to build in security by design, to\nensure they maintain the ability to both identify and report harmful and\nillegal activities ... and to lawfully and exceptionally act on a lawful\nauthority,\" Europol said.\n\nThus far, the pleading to Meta hasn't stopped it from beginning the global\nE2EE rollout that began last year.\n\nGail Kent, Meta's global policy director for Messenger, said in December the\nE2EE debate is far more complicated than the child safety issue that law\nenforcement makes it out to be, and leaving an encryption back door in\nproducts for police to take advantage of would only hamper trust in its\nmessaging products.\n\nKent said Meta's E2EE implementation prevents client-side scanning of content,\nwhich has been one of the biggest complaints from law enforcement. Kent said\neven that technology would violate user trust, as it serves as a workaround to\nintrude on user privacy without compromising encryption - an approach Meta is\nunwilling to take, according to Kent's blog post.\n\nAs was pointed out during previous attempts to undermine E2EE, not only would\nan encryption back door (client-side scanning or otherwise) provide an inroad\nfor criminals to access secured information, it wouldn't stop criminals from\nfinding some other way to send illicit content without the prying eyes of law\nenforcement able to take a look.\n\nMeta hasn't responded to requests for comment on this latest E2EE row, but did\ntell us in 2023 that it doesn't need to leave a crack in its own encryption to\ndetect illicit material.\n\n\"We don't think people want us reading their private messages, so have\ndeveloped safety measures that prevent, detect and allow us to take action\nagainst this heinous abuse, while maintaining online privacy and security,\" a\nMeta spokesperson told us last year. \"It's misleading and inaccurate to say\nthat encryption would have prevented us from identifying and reporting\naccounts ... to the authorities.\"\n\nIn other words, don't expect Meta to cave on this one when it can develop a\nfancy new detection algorithm instead. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Encryption\n  * European Union\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Encryption\n  * European Union\n  * Meta\n  * Privacy\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Austria\n  * Belgium\n  * Brexit\n  * Bulgaria\n  * cookies\n  * Croatia\n  * Cyprus\n  * Czech Republic\n  * Denmark\n  * Estonia\n  * European Commission\n  * Facebook\n  * Finland\n  * France\n  * GDPR\n  * Germany\n  * Greece\n  * Hungary\n  * Ireland\n  * Italy\n  * Latvia\n  * Let's Encrypt\n  * Lithuania\n  * Luxembourg\n  * Malta\n  * Netherlands\n  * Open Compute Project\n  * Poland\n  * Portugal\n  * Privacy Sandbox\n  * Romania\n  * RSA Conference\n  * Signal\n  * Slovakia\n  * Slovenia\n  * Spain\n  * Sweden\n  * TLS\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Andrew McCollum\n  * Chris Hughes\n  * Dustin Moskovitz\n  * Eduardo Saverin\n  * Mark Zuckerberg\n  * Security\n\n#### More about\n\n12 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Encryption\n  * European Union\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Encryption\n  * European Union\n  * Meta\n  * Privacy\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Austria\n  * Belgium\n  * Brexit\n  * Bulgaria\n  * cookies\n  * Croatia\n  * Cyprus\n  * Czech Republic\n  * Denmark\n  * Estonia\n  * European Commission\n  * Facebook\n  * Finland\n  * France\n  * GDPR\n  * Germany\n  * Greece\n  * Hungary\n  * Ireland\n  * Italy\n  * Latvia\n  * Let's Encrypt\n  * Lithuania\n  * Luxembourg\n  * Malta\n  * Netherlands\n  * Open Compute Project\n  * Poland\n  * Portugal\n  * Privacy Sandbox\n  * Romania\n  * RSA Conference\n  * Signal\n  * Slovakia\n  * Slovenia\n  * Spain\n  * Sweden\n  * TLS\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Andrew McCollum\n  * Chris Hughes\n  * Dustin Moskovitz\n  * Eduardo Saverin\n  * Mark Zuckerberg\n  * Security\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### EU tells Meta it can't paywall privacy\n\nPlatforms should not confront users with 'binary choice' over personal data\nuse\n\nSecurity4 days | 70\n\n#### Meta lets Llama 3 LLM out to graze, claims it can give Google and\nAnthropic a kicking\n\nPlans multilingual 400 billion parameter version, but starts with more modest\nfare\n\nAI + ML4 days | 8\n\n#### US legislators propose American Privacy Rights Act - and it looks quite\ngood\n\nAfter two decades of calls for national protections, something may actually\nhappen\n\nPublic Sector14 days | 39\n\n#### Reducing the cloud security overhead\n\nWhy creating a layered defensive strategy that includes security by design can\nhelp address cloud challenges\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Next-gen Meta AI chip serves up ads while sipping power\n\nFresh silicon won't curb Zuck's appetite for GPUs just yet\n\nOn-Prem12 days | 6\n\n#### US House approves FISA renewal \u2013 warrantless surveillance and all\n\nInfosec in brief PLUS: Chinese chipmaker Nexperia attacked;
