And only 21 percent of people have a\nretirement plan.\n\nSaleen Martin USA TODAY\n\nAn increasing number of people are worried that they won\u2019t have enough money\nto live comfortably in retirement, and men aren\u2019t as financially secure as\nthey once were, according to an annual survey from AARP.\n\nThe AARP Financial Security Trends Survey, conducted in January and released\nin April, included interviews with more than 8,300 Americans over 30 across\nevery state in the country. Conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago,\nthe survey aims to analyze the financial experiences and attitudes among\nAmericans.\n\nOne of the survey\u2019s biggest findings is that 61% of those 50 and up are\nworried they won\u2019t have enough money for retirement, Indira Venkat, senior\nvice president of research at AARP, told USA TODAY on Wednesday.\n\nAnd if you break those numbers down even more, one in five of people who have\nnot retired have no savings at all, Venkat said.\n\n\u201cAmong retirement savers who are 50 and over, there's a growing number\ncompared to last year that don't expect that they will save sufficiently if\nthey continue at the current rate that they save,\u201d she said.\n\nThose numbers \u201cshould be a wake-up call for all of us,\u201d she said.\n\n## Adults are worried about having enough for retirement. What does this mean?\n\nVenkat said the reason some people may be worried about saving for retirement\nis because they don\u2019t have access to retirement plans through their jobs.\n\n\u201cToday, almost half of those who are in the private sector workforce, and\nthat's 57 million workers, don't have the option to save for retirement\nthrough their work,\u201d she said.\n\nPeople who have access to retirement plans are more likely to save, she said.\n\nAnother reason for retirement woes is inflation. Calling it a \u201cbread and\nbutter\u201d and \u201ckitchen table\u201d issue, she said many people are struggling to\nafford basic necessities and gas.\n\nIn fact, over 70% of all respondents expressed concern about prices rising at\na faster rate than their income.\n\nMany people also have month-to-month balances on credit cards, she said.\nAccording to the researchers, the average amount of credit card debt carried\nfrom month to month increased from $7,538 in January 2023 to $8,169 in January\n2024.\n\n## Gender and financial planning\n\nAARP noted findings among men specifically.\n\nAmong men who are regularly saving for retirement, 28% are saving 10% or more\nof their income. In January 2022, more men \u2013 35% \u2013 were saving 10% or more.\n\nOther findings include:\n\n  * 40% of men are worried about basic expenses (up from 33% in January 2022)\n  * 42% of all men age 30 and up describe their financial situation as \u201conly fair\u201d or \u201cpoor\u201d (up from 34% in January 2022)\n  * 43% of men carry a credit card balance (up from 38% in January 2022)\n  * 62% of men have emergency savings today (down from 69% in January 2022)\n\n\u201cWe are seeing that men today are a little bit more worried than they were in\nprior years about their financial security and situation,\u201d Venkat said.\n\u201cForty-two percent of men, if they're asked to describe their financial\nsituation, say it's terrible.\u201d\n\nThe team also compared responses among men and women, finding that:\n\n  * 62% of men are more likely to have an emergency savings vs. 58% of women\n  * 42% of men are less likely to be worried about managing debt vs. 47% of women\n  * 61% of men with debt are more likely to view their debt as manageable vs. 52% of women\n\n## Limitations of the survey\n\nVenkat said the survey was \u201cvery robust\u201d and was done using probability\nsamples, but one limitation is that it was conducted in English and Spanish\nonly.\n\n\u201cTo the extent there are other dominant spoken languages in the home, those\nindividuals are not represented in this study,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then, of\ncourse, the standard margin of error with any survey applies to this.\u201d\n\n## Financial planning among survey respondents\n\nThere were some surprising findings surrounding financial planning, Venkat\nsaid.\n\nAmong older adults who are not yet retired, 94% said it is important for them\nto have a plan to manage their money during retirement. Among them, just 21%\nof them have a plan for how to manage their money in retirement, she said.\n\nShe said AARP has resources to help people plan, including tools like a Social\nSecurity calculator, an AARP retirement calculator, a required minimum\ndistribution calculator and a 401(k) calculator.\n\nThe concerns respondents expressed while completing the survey further prove\nthe importance of having a plan for retirement, AARP says.\n\n\u201cPlans need to address not only how to build savings during working years,\"\nthe company writes, \"but also how to spend money in retirement in a way that\nwill allow it to last.\"\n\nSaleen Martin is a reporter on USA TODAY's NOW team.
