The\nMarkup\u2019s proven methodology and expert journalists will improve coverage\nacross all CalMatters beats \u2013 including education, health, housing and more \u2013\nas it already has with localized reporting on how Los Angeles measures the\n\u201cvulnerability\u201d of unhoused people and how Angelenos were victims of digital\ndiscrimination.\n\nLaunched in 2020, The Markup is an industry-leading news organization rooted\nin a simple premise: technology is integrated across our daily lives, and\npeople deserve to better understand how it impacts them and what they can do\nabout it. The Markup\u2019s data-driven investigative reporting, accessible guides\nfor the public, and creation of actionable tools like Blacklight, a real-time\nprivacy inspector that readers have used to conduct over 13 million website\nscans, has helped everyone from consumers to policymakers to corporations take\ncontrol of their relationship with technology.\n\n\u201cPairing our proven methodology with CalMatters\u2019 deep expertise will deliver\nunparalleled investigative journalism in California, and serve as an example\nnationwide,\u201d said Nabiha Syed, CEO of The Markup. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned that\nlocalized reporting leads to speedy and widespread impact, and that, combined\nwith the resources we make available for local communities, has triggered\nnational and international change. We\u2019re really excited about what we\u2019ll do\ntogether.\u201d\n\nThe acquisition completes a repositioning of CalMatters to properly cover our\ntechnology influenced age. Khari Johnson, previously a senior reporter at\nWIRED, joined CalMatters at the start of the year. Last week CalMatters\nlaunched Digital Democracy, an innovative custom-built AI tool that reveals\nhow policy decisions are made in California.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re tremendously proud of what we\u2019ve built in nine short years, covering\nCalifornia for Californians,\u201d said CalMatters CEO Neil Chase. \u201cWe also have a\nnational and worldwide audience because of California\u2019s global impact.\nBringing The Markup\u2019s extraordinary talent and tools to all of our beats is a\nunique, exciting opportunity at the perfect time.\u201d\n\nLeadership for the newly combined organization will include Chase as CEO and\nKristen Go as editor-in-chief. Sisi Wei will transition from her role as\neditor-in-chief of The Markup to a groundbreaking new role in nonprofit\njournalism: Chief Impact Officer. As CIO, Wei will apply The Markup\u2019s\njournalistic approach to accelerate all of CalMatters\u2019 work and forge new ways\nfor journalism to serve communities. Syed will be a strategic advisor to the\norganization until she takes a new external role effective July 1.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thrilled to see these two strong national and local newsrooms coming\ntogether with capabilities that complement each other so well,\u201d said Kathy Im,\nDirector of the Journalism and Media program at the John D. and Catherine T.\nMacArthur Foundation, which supports The Markup. \u201cThis out-of-the-box thinking\nwill be what we need to build a strong news ecosystem serving communities\nnationwide.\u201d\n\n  1.

CalMatters has garnered dozens of prestigious regional and national\njournalism awards since its launch in 2015 and is especially well known for\nits innovative voter guides and daily WhatMatters newsletter. The Markup has\nbeen featured in Fast Company\u2019s Most Innovative Companies list as well as\nawarded a World Changing Idea, and has been the recipient of prestigious\nawards including the 2024 Philip Meyer Award, the highest honor in data\njournalism, two Murrow awards and a Gerald Loeb Award, both in 2022.\n\nTo learn more about The Markup, visit themarkup.org or follow on X, Instagram,\nLinkedIn or Facebook.\n\nWe want to hear from you\n\nWant to submit a guest commentary or reaction to an article we wrote?
