Patrons of the Stonewall,\nother Village lesbian and gay bars, trans activists and unhoused LGBT\nindividuals fought back when the police became violent. The riots are widely\nconsidered the watershed event that transformed the gay liberation movement\nand the twentieth-century fight for LGBT rights in the United\nStates.^[5]^[6]^[7]\n\nAs was common for American gay bars at the time, the Stonewall Inn was owned\nby the Italian-American Mafia.^[8]^[9]^[10] While police raids on gay bars\nwere routine in the 1960s, officers quickly lost control of the situation at\nthe Stonewall Inn on June 28, 1969. Tensions between New York City Police and\ngay residents of Greenwich Village erupted into more protests the next evening\nand again several nights later. Within weeks, Village residents organized into\nactivist groups demanding decriminalization of homosexuality. The new activist\norganizations concentrated on confrontational tactics, and within months three\nnewspapers were established to promote rights for gay men, lesbians and\nbisexual people.\n\nA year after the uprising, to mark the anniversary on June 28, 1970, the first\ngay pride marches took place in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, and San\nFrancisco.^[11] Within a few years, gay rights organizations were founded\nacross the US and the world. Today, LGBT Pride events are held annually\nworldwide in June in honor of the Stonewall riots, with International LGBT\nPride Day on June 28.\n\nThe Stonewall National Monument was established at the site in 2016.^[12] An\nestimated 5 million participants commemorated the 50th anniversary of the\nStonewall uprising,^[13] and on June 6, 2019, New York City Police\nCommissioner James P. O'Neill formally apologized for the actions of officers\nat Stonewall in 1969.^[14]^[15]\n\n## Background[edit]\n\nVery few establishments welcomed gay people in the 1950s and 1960s; those that\ndid were often run by organized crime groups, due to the illegal nature of gay\nbars at the time. The anti-homosexual legal system of the 1950s and\n1960s^[note 2]^[16] prompted early homosexual groups in the US to prove gay\npeople could be assimilated into society, and such early groups favored non-\nconfrontational education for homosexuals and heterosexuals alike. The last\nyears of the 1960s saw activity among many social/political movements,\nincluding the civil rights movement, the counterculture of the 1960s, and the\nanti-Vietnam War movement. Such influences served as catalysts for the\nStonewall riots.\n\n### Homosexuality in 20th-century United States[edit]\n\nFurther information: LGBT history in the United States and Lavender scare\n\nFollowing the social upheaval of World War II, many people in the United\nStates felt a fervent desire to \"restore the prewar social order and hold off\nthe forces of change\", according to historian Barry Adam.^[19] Spurred by the\nnational emphasis on anti-communism, Senator Joseph McCarthy conducted\nhearings searching for communists in the US government, the US Army, and other\ngovernment-funded agencies and institutions, leading to a national paranoia.\nAnarchists, communists, and other people deemed un-American and subversive\nwere considered security risks. Gay men and lesbians were included in this\nlist by the US State Department on the theory that they were susceptible to\nblackmail. In 1950, a Senate investigation chaired by Clyde R. Hoey noted in a\nreport, \"It is generally believed that those who engage in overt acts of\nperversion lack the emotional stability of normal persons\",^[20] and said all\nof the government's intelligence agencies \"are in complete agreement that sex\nperverts in Government constitute security risks\".^[21] Between 1947 and 1950,\n1,700 federal job applications were denied, 4,380 people were discharged from\nthe military, and 420 were fired from their government jobs for being\nsuspected homosexuals.^[22]\n\nThroughout the 1950s and 1960s, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\nand police departments kept lists of known homosexuals and their favored\nestablishments and friends; the US Post Office kept track of addresses where\nmaterial pertaining to homosexuality was mailed.^[23] State and local\ngovernments followed suit: bars catering to gay men and lesbians were shut\ndown and their customers were arrested and exposed in newspapers. Cities\nperformed \"sweeps\" to rid neighborhoods, parks, bars, and beaches of gay\npeople. They outlawed the wearing of opposite-gender clothes and universities\nexpelled instructors suspected of being homosexual.^[24]\n\nIn 1952, the American Psychiatric Association listed homosexuality in the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) as a mental disorder. A large-scale\nstudy of homosexuality in 1962 was used to justify the inclusion of the\n\"disorder\" as a supposed pathological hidden fear of the opposite sex caused\nby traumatic parent\u2013child relationships. This view was widely influential in\nthe medical profession.^[25] In 1956, the psychologist Evelyn Hooker performed\na study that compared the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-\nidentified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference.^[26]\nHer study stunned the medical community and made her a hero to many gay men\nand lesbians,^[27] but homosexuality remained in the DSM until 1974.^[28]\n\n### Homophile activism[edit]\n\nMain article: Homophile movement\n\nIn response to this trend, two organizations formed independently of each\nother to advance the cause of gay men and lesbians and provide opportunities\nwhere they could socialize without fear of being arrested. Los Angeles area\nhomosexuals created the Mattachine Society in 1950, in the home of communist\nactivist Harry Hay.^[29] Their objectives were to unify homosexuals, educate\nthem, provide leadership, and assist \"sexual deviants\" with legal\ntroubles.^[30] Facing enormous opposition to their radical approach, in 1953\nthe Mattachine shifted their focus to assimilation and respectability. They\nreasoned that they would change more minds about homosexuality by proving that\ngay men and lesbians were normal people, no different from\nheterosexuals.^[31]^[32] Soon after, several women in San Francisco met in\ntheir living rooms to form the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB) for lesbians.^[33]\nAlthough the eight women who created the DOB initially came together to be\nable to have a safe place to dance, as the DOB grew they developed similar\ngoals to the Mattachine and urged their members to assimilate into general\nsociety.^[34]\n\nOne of the first challenges to government repression came in 1953. An\norganization named ONE, Inc. published a magazine called ONE. The US Postal\nService refused to mail its August issue, which concerned homosexual people in\nheterosexual marriages, on the grounds that the material was obscene despite\nit being covered in brown paper wrapping. The case eventually went to the\nSupreme Court, which in 1958 ruled that ONE, Inc. could mail its materials\nthrough the Postal Service.^[35]\n\nHomophile organizations\u2014as homosexual groups self-identified in this era\u2014grew\nin number and spread to the East Coast. Gradually, members of these\norganizations grew bolder. Frank Kameny founded the Mattachine of Washington,\nD.C. He had been fired from the US Army Map Service for being a homosexual and\nsued unsuccessfully to be reinstated. Kameny wrote that homosexuals were no\ndifferent from heterosexuals, often aiming his efforts at mental health\nprofessionals, some of whom attended Mattachine and DOB meetings telling\nmembers they were abnormal.^[36]\n\nIn 1965, news on Cuban prison work camps for homosexuals inspired Mattachine\nNew York and D.C. to organize protests at the United Nations and the White\nHouse. Similar demonstrations were then held also at other government\nbuildings. The purpose was to protest the treatment of gay people in\nCuba^[37]^[38] and US employment discrimination. These pickets shocked many\ngay people and upset some of the leadership of Mattachine and the\nDOB.^[39]^[40] At the same time, demonstrations in the civil rights movement\nand opposition to the Vietnam War all grew in prominence, frequency, and\nseverity throughout the 1960s, as did their confrontations with police\nforces.^[41]\n\n### Earlier resistance and riots[edit]\n\nMain article: List of LGBT actions in the United States prior to the Stonewall\nriots\n\nSee also: Cooper Do-nuts Riot and Compton's Cafeteria riot\n\nOn the outer fringes of the few small gay communities were people who\nchallenged gender expectations. They were effeminate men and masculine women,\nor people who dressed and lived in contrast to their sex assigned at birth,\neither part or full-time. Contemporaneous nomenclature classified them as\ntransvestites and they were the most visible representatives of sexual\nminorities. They believed the carefully crafted image portrayed by the\nMattachine Society and DOB asserted homosexuals were respectable, normal\npeople.^[42] The Mattachine and DOB considered the trials of being arrested\nfor wearing clothing of the opposite gender as a parallel to the struggles of\nhomophile organizations: similar but distinctly separate.\n\nGay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people staged a small riot at the\nCooper Do-nuts cafe in Los Angeles in 1959 in response to police\nharassment.^[43] In a larger 1966 event in San Francisco, drag queens,\nhustlers, and trans women^[44] were sitting in Compton's Cafeteria when the\npolice arrived to arrest people appearing to be physically male who were\npresenting as women. A riot ensued, with the cafeteria patrons slinging cups,\nplates, and saucers and breaking the plexiglass windows in the front of the\nrestaurant and returning several days later to smash the windows again after\nthey were replaced.^[45] Professor Susan Stryker classifies the Compton's\nCafeteria riot as an \"act of anti-transgender discrimination, rather than an\nact of discrimination against sexual orientation\" and connects the uprising to\nthe issues of gender, race, and class that were being downplayed by homophile\norganizations.^[42] It marked the beginning of transgender activism in San\nFrancisco.^[45]\n\n### Greenwich Village[edit]\n\nWashington Square Park in Greenwich Village\n\nThe Manhattan neighborhoods of Greenwich Village and Harlem were home to\nsizable gay and lesbian populations after World War I, when people who had\nserved in the military took advantage of the opportunity to settle in larger\ncities. The enclaves of gay men and lesbians, described by a newspaper story\nas \"short-haired women and long-haired men\", developed a distinct subculture\nthrough the following two decades.^[46] Prohibition inadvertently benefited\ngay establishments, as drinking alcohol was pushed underground along with\nother behaviors considered immoral. New York City passed laws against\nhomosexuality in public and private businesses, but because alcohol was in\nhigh demand, speakeasies and impromptu drinking establishments were so\nnumerous and temporary that authorities were unable to police them all.^[47]\nHowever, police raids continued, resulting in the closure of iconic\nestablishments such as Eve's Hangout in 1926.^[48]\n\nThe social repression of the 1950s resulted in a cultural revolution in\nGreenwich Village. A cohort of poets, later named the Beat poets, wrote about\nthe evils of the social organization at the time, glorifying anarchy, drugs,\nand hedonistic pleasures over unquestioning social compliance, consumerism,\nand closed-mindedness. Of them, Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs\u2014both\nGreenwich Village residents\u2014also wrote bluntly and honestly about\nhomosexuality. Their writings attracted sympathetic liberal-minded people, as\nwell as homosexuals looking for a community.^[49]\n\nBy the early 1960s, a campaign to rid New York City of gay bars was in full\neffect by order of Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr., who was concerned about the\nimage of the city in preparation for the 1964 World's Fair. The city revoked\nthe liquor licenses of the bars and undercover police officers worked to\nentrap as many homosexual men as possible.^[50] Entrapment usually consisted\nof an undercover officer who found a man in a bar or public park, engaged him\nin conversation; if the conversation headed toward the possibility that they\nmight leave together\u2014or the officer bought the man a drink\u2014he was arrested for\nsolicitation. One story in the New York Post described an arrest in a gym\nlocker room, where the officer grabbed his crotch, moaning, and a man who\nasked him if he was all right was arrested.^[51] Few lawyers would defend\ncases as undesirable as these and some of those lawyers kicked back their fees\nto the arresting officer.^[52]\n\nThe Mattachine Society succeeded in getting newly elected mayor John Lindsay\nto end the campaign of police entrapment in New York City. They had a more\ndifficult time with the New York State Liquor Authority (SLA). While no laws\nprohibited serving homosexuals, courts allowed the SLA discretion in approving\nand revoking liquor licenses for businesses that might become\n\"disorderly\".^[10]^[53] Despite the high population of gay men and lesbians\nwho called Greenwich Village home, very few places existed, other than bars,\nwhere they were able to congregate openly without being harassed or arrested.\nIn 1966 the New York Mattachine held a \"sip-in\" at a Greenwich Village bar\nnamed Julius, which was frequented by gay men, to illustrate the\ndiscrimination homosexuals faced.^[54]\n\nNone of the bars frequented by gay men and lesbians were owned by gay people.\nAlmost all of them were owned and controlled by organized crime, who treated\nthe regulars poorly, watered down the liquor, and overcharged for drinks.\nHowever, they also paid off police to prevent frequent raids.^[10]^[55]\n\n### Stonewall Inn[edit]\n\nMain article: Stonewall Inn\n\nWikimedia | \u00a9 OpenStreetMap\n\n50m 55yds\n\n3\n\n2\n\nStonewall Inn\n\n1\n\nLocation of the Stonewall Inn in relation to Greenwich Village\n\n1\n\nStonewall Inn\n\n2\n\nChristopher Park\n\n3\n\nSheridan Square\n\nThe Stonewall Inn, located at 51 and 53 Christopher Street, along with several\nother establishments in the city, was owned by the Genovese crime\nfamily.^[8]^[10] In 1966, three members of the Mafia invested $3,500 to turn\nthe Stonewall Inn into a gay bar, after it had been a restaurant and a\nnightclub for heterosexuals. Once a week a police officer would collect\nenvelopes of cash as a payoff known as a gayola, as the Stonewall Inn had no\nliquor license.^[56]^[57] It had no running water behind the bar\u2014dirty glasses\nwere run through tubs of water and immediately reused.^[10]^[55] There were no\nfire exits, and the toilets overran consistently.^[58] Though the bar was not\nused for prostitution, drug sales and other black market activities took\nplace. It was the only bar for gay men in New York City where dancing was\nallowed;^[59] dancing was its main draw since its re-opening as a gay\nclub.^[60]\n\nVisitors to the Stonewall Inn in 1969 were greeted by a bouncer who inspected\nthem through a peephole in the door. The legal drinking age was 18 and to\navoid unwittingly letting in undercover police (who were called \"Lily Law\",\n\"Alice Blue Gown\", or \"Betty Badge\"^[61]), visitors would have to be known by\nthe doorman or 'look gay'. Patrons were required to sign their names in a book\nto prove that the bar was a private \"bottle club\", but they rarely signed\ntheir real names.^[10] There were two dance floors in the Stonewall. The\ninterior was painted black, making it very dark inside, with pulsing gel\nlights or black lights. If police were spotted, regular white lights were\nturned on, signaling that everyone should stop dancing or touching.^[61] In\nthe rear of the bar was a smaller room frequented by \"queens\"; it was one of\ntwo bars where effeminate men who wore makeup and teased their hair (though\ndressed in men's clothing) could go.^[62] Only a few people in full drag were\nallowed in by the bouncers. The customers were \"98 percent male\" but a few\nlesbians sometimes came to the bar. Younger homeless adolescent males, who\nslept in nearby Christopher Park, would often try to get in so customers would\nbuy them drinks.^[63] The age of the clientele ranged between the upper teens\nand early thirties and the racial mix was distributed among mainly white, with\nBlack, and Hispanic patrons.^[62]^[64] Because of its mix of people, its\nlocation, and the attraction of dancing, the Stonewall Inn was known by many\nas \"the gay bar in the city\".^[65]\n\nPolice raids on gay bars were frequent, occurring on average once a month for\neach bar. Many bars kept extra liquor in a secret panel behind the bar, or in\na car down the block, to facilitate resuming business as quickly as possible\nif alcohol was seized.^[8]^[10] Bar management usually knew about raids\nbeforehand due to police tip-offs, and raids occurred early enough in the\nevening that business could commence after the police had finished.^[66]\nDuring a typical raid, the lights were turned on and customers were lined up\nand their identification cards checked. Those without identification or\ndressed in full drag were arrested; others were allowed to leave. Some of the\nmen, including those in drag, used their draft cards as identification. Women\nwere required to wear three pieces of feminine clothing and would be arrested\nif found not wearing them. Typically, employees and management of the bars\nwere also arrested.^[66] The period immediately before June 28, 1969, was\nmarked by frequent raids of local bars\u2014including a raid at the Stonewall Inn\non the Tuesday before the riots^[67]\u2014and the closing of the Checkerboard, the\nTele-Star, and two other clubs in Greenwich Village.^[68]^[69]\n\nHistorian David Carter presents information^[70] indicating that the Mafia\nowners of the Stonewall and the manager were blackmailing wealthier customers,\nparticularly those who worked in the Financial District.^[10] They appeared to\nbe making more money from extortion than they were from liquor sales in the\nbar. Carter deduces that when the police were unable to receive kickbacks from\nblackmail and the theft of negotiable bonds (facilitated by pressuring gay\nWall Street customers), they decided to close the Stonewall Inn permanently.\n\n## Riots[edit]\n\n### Police raid[edit]\n\nLayout of the Stonewall Inn, 1969^[71]Owner Larry Boxx (here in 1972 at\nStonewall Miami Beach with one of the performers there)The sign left by police\nfollowing the raid is now on display just inside the entrance.\n\nTwo undercover policewomen and two undercover policemen entered the bar early\nthat evening to gather visual evidence, as the Public Morals Squad waited\noutside for the signal. Once ready, the undercover officers called for backup\nfrom the Sixth Precinct using the bar's pay telephone. Stonewall employees do\nnot recall being tipped off that a raid was to occur that night, as was the\ncustom. According to Duberman (p. 194), there was a rumor that one might\nhappen, but since it was much later than raids generally took place, Stonewall\nmanagement thought the tip was inaccurate. The owner was Larry Boxx.^[72]\n\nAt 1:20 a.m. on Saturday, June 28, 1969, four plainclothes policemen in dark\nsuits, two patrol officers in uniform, Detective Charles Smythe, and Deputy\nInspector Seymour Pine arrived at the Stonewall Inn's double doors and\nannounced \"Police! We're taking the place!\"^[73] The music was turned off and\nthe main lights were turned on. Approximately 205 people were in the bar that\nnight. Patrons who had never experienced a police raid were confused. A few\nwho realized what was happening began to run for doors and windows in the\nbathrooms, but police barred the doors. Michael Fader remembered,\n\n> Things happened so fast you kind of got caught not knowing. All of a sudden\n> there were police there and we were told to all get in lines and to have our\n> identification ready to be led out of the bar.\n\nThe raid did not go as planned. Standard procedure was to line up the patrons,\ncheck their identification and have female police officers take customers\ndressed as women to the bathroom to verify their sex, upon which any people\nappearing to be physically male and dressed as women would be arrested. Those\ndressed as women that night refused to go with the officers. Men in line began\nto refuse to produce their identification. The police decided to take everyone\npresent to the police station, after separating those suspected of cross-\ndressing in a room in the back of the bar. All parties involved recall that a\nsense of discomfort spread very quickly, started by police who assaulted some\nof the lesbians by \"feeling some of them up inappropriately\" while frisking\nthem.^[74]\n\n> When did you ever see a fag fight back? ... Now, times were a-changin'.\n> Tuesday night was the last night for bullshit ... Predominantly, the theme\n> [w]as, \"this shit has got to stop!\"\n\n\u2014anonymous Stonewall riots participant^[75]\n\nThe police were to transport the bar's alcohol in patrol wagons. Twenty-eight\ncases of beer and nineteen bottles of hard liquor were seized, but the patrol\nwagons had not yet arrived, so patrons were required to wait in line for about\n15 minutes.^[76] Those who were not arrested were released from the front\ndoor, but they did not leave quickly as usual. Instead, they stopped outside\nand a crowd began to grow and watch. Within minutes, between 100 and 150\npeople had congregated outside, some after they were released from inside the\nStonewall and some after noticing the police cars and the crowd. Although the\npolice forcefully pushed or kicked some patrons out of the bar, some customers\nreleased by the police performed for the crowd by posing and saluting the\npolice in an exaggerated fashion. The crowd's applause encouraged them\nfurther.^[77]\n\nWhen the first patrol wagon arrived, Inspector Pine recalled that the\ncrowd\u2014most of whom were homosexual\u2014had grown to at least ten times the number\nof people who were arrested and they all became very quiet.^[78] Confusion\nover radio communication delayed the arrival of a second wagon. The police\nbegan escorting Mafia members into the first wagon, to the cheers of the\nbystanders. Next, regular employees were loaded into the wagon. A bystander\nshouted, \"Gay power!\", someone began singing \"We Shall Overcome\" and the crowd\nreacted with amusement and general good humor mixed with \"growing and\nintensive hostility\".^[79] An officer shoved a person in drag, who responded\nby hitting him on the head with her purse. The cop clubbed her over the head,\nas the crowd began to boo. Author Edmund White, who had been passing by,\nrecalled, \"Everyone's restless, angry, and high-spirited. No one has a slogan,\nno one even has an attitude, but something's brewing.\"^[80] Pennies, then beer\nbottles, were thrown at the wagon as a rumor spread through the crowd that\npatrons still inside the bar were being beaten.\n\nA scuffle broke out when a woman in handcuffs was escorted from the door of\nthe bar to the waiting police wagon several times. She escaped repeatedly and\nfought with four of the police, swearing and shouting, for about ten minutes.\nDescribed as \"a typical New York butch\" and \"a dyke\u2013stone butch\", she had been\nhit on the head by an officer with a baton for, as one witness claimed,\ncomplaining that her handcuffs were too tight.^[81] Bystanders recalled that\nthe woman, whose identity remains unknown (Storm\u00e9 DeLarverie has been\nidentified by some, including herself, as the woman, but accounts\nvary^[82]^[note 3]), sparked the crowd to fight when she looked at bystanders\nand shouted, \"Why don't you guys do something?\" After an officer picked her up\nand heaved her into the back of the wagon,^[85] the crowd became a mob and\nbecame violent.^[86]^[87]\n\n### Violence breaks out[edit]\n\nThe police tried to restrain some of the crowd, knocking a few people down,\nwhich incited bystanders even more. Some of those handcuffed in the wagon\nescaped when police left them unattended (deliberately, according to some\nwitnesses).^[note 4]^[89] As the crowd tried to overturn the police wagon, two\npolice cars and the wagon\u2014with a few slashed tires\u2014left immediately, with\nInspector Pine urging them to return as soon as possible. The commotion\nattracted more people who learned what was happening. Someone in the crowd\ndeclared that the bar had been raided because \"they didn't pay off the cops\",\nto which someone else yelled, \"Let's pay them off!\"^[90] Coins sailed through\nthe air towards the police as the crowd shouted \"Pigs!\" and \"Faggot cops!\"\nBeer cans were thrown and the police lashed out, dispersing some of the crowd\nwho found a construction site nearby with stacks of bricks. The police,\noutnumbered by between 500 and 600 people, grabbed several people, including\nactivist folk singer (and mentor of Bob Dylan) Dave Van Ronk\u2014who had been\nattracted to the revolt from a bar two doors away from the Stonewall. Though\nVan Ronk was not gay, he had experienced police violence when he participated\nin antiwar demonstrations: \"As far as I was concerned, anybody who'd stand\nagainst the cops was all right with me and that's why I stayed in ... Every\ntime you turned around the cops were pulling some outrage or another.\"^[90]\nVan Ronk was the first of thirteen arrested that night.^[91] Ten police\nofficers\u2014including two policewomen\u2014barricaded themselves, Van Ronk, Howard\nSmith (a column writer for The Village Voice), and several handcuffed\ndetainees inside the Stonewall Inn for their own safety.\n\nMultiple accounts of the riot assert that there was no pre-existing\norganization or apparent cause for the demonstration; what ensued was\nspontaneous.^[note 5] Michael Fader explained:^[94]\n\n> We all had a collective feeling like we'd had enough of this kind of shit.\n> It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of\n> like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular\n> night in the one particular place and it was not an organized demonstration\n> ... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was\n> like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been\n> taken from us ... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it\n> was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just\n> kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the\n> destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we\n> felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we\n> demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and\n> letting them shove us around\u2014it's like standing your ground for the first\n> time and in a really strong way and that's what caught the police by\n> surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue and\n> we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line\n> was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.\n\nThis photograph \u2013 the only known photo of the riots \u2013 appeared on the front\npage of The New York Daily News on Sunday, June 29, 1969. Here the \"street\nkids\" who were the first to fight back against the police are seen.\n\nThe only known photograph from the first night of the riots, taken by\nfreelance photographer Joseph Ambrosini, shows the homeless gay youth who\nslept in nearby Christopher Park, scuffling with police. Jackie Hormona and\nTommy Lanigan-Schmidt are on the far left.^[1]^[95]\n\nThe Mattachine Society newsletter a month later offered its explanation of why\nthe riots occurred: \"It catered largely to a group of people who are not\nwelcome in, or cannot afford, other places of homosexual social gathering ...\nThe Stonewall became home to these kids. When it was raided, they fought for\nit. That and the fact that they had nothing to lose other than the most\ntolerant and broadminded gay place in town, explains why.\"^[96]\n\nGarbage cans, garbage, bottles, rocks, and bricks were hurled at the building,\nbreaking the windows. Witnesses attest that \"flame queens\", hustlers, and gay\n\"street kids\"\u2014the most outcast people in the gay community\u2014were responsible\nfor the first volley of projectiles, as well as the uprooting of a parking\nmeter used as a battering ram on the doors of the Stonewall Inn.^[97]\n\nThe mob lit garbage on fire and stuffed it through the broken windows as the\npolice grabbed a fire hose. Because it had no water pressure, the hose was\nineffective in dispersing the crowd and seemed only to encourage them.^[98]\nMarsha P. Johnson later said that it was the police that had started the fire\nin the bar.^[99]^[note 6] When demonstrators broke through the windows\u2014which\nhad been covered by plywood by the bar owners to deter the police from raiding\nthe bar\u2014the police inside unholstered their pistols. The doors flew open and\nofficers pointed their weapons at the angry crowd, threatening to shoot.\nHoward Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar and\nstuffed it in his pants, unsure if he might have to use it against the mob or\nthe police. He watched someone squirt lighter fluid into the bar; as it was\nlit and the police took aim, sirens were heard and fire trucks arrived. The\nonslaught had lasted 45 minutes.^[102]\n\nWhen the violence broke out, the women and transmasculine people being held\ndown the street at The Women's House of Detention joined in by chanting,\nsetting fire to their belongings and tossing them into the street below. The\nhistorian Hugh Ryan says, \"When I would talk to people about Stonewall, they\nwould tell me, that night on Stonewall, we looked to the prison because we saw\nthe women rioting and chanting, \"Gay rights, gay rights, gay rights.\"^[103]\n\n### Escalation[edit]\n\nThe Tactical Patrol Force (TPF) of the New York City Police Department arrived\nto free the police trapped inside the Stonewall. One officer's eye was cut and\na few others were bruised from being struck by flying debris. Bob Kohler, who\nwas walking his dog by the Stonewall that night, saw the TPF arrive:\n\n> I had been in enough riots to know the fun was over ... The cops were\n> totally humiliated. This never, ever happened. They were angrier than I\n> guess they had ever been because everybody else had rioted ... but the\n> fairies were not supposed to riot ... no group had ever forced cops to\n> retreat before, so the anger was just enormous. I mean, they wanted to\n> kill.^[104]\n\nWith larger numbers, police detained anyone they could and put them in patrol\nwagons to go to jail, though Inspector Pine recalled, \"Fights erupted with the\ntransvestites, who wouldn't go into the patrol wagon.\" His recollection was\ncorroborated by another witness across the street who said, \"All I could see\nabout who was fighting was that it was transvestites and they were fighting\nfuriously.\"^[105]\n\nThe TPF formed a phalanx and attempted to clear the streets by marching slowly\nand pushing the crowd back. The mob openly mocked the police. The crowd\ncheered, started impromptu kick lines and sang to the tune of \"Ta-ra-ra Boom-\nde-ay\": \"We are the Stonewall girls/ We wear our hair in curls/ We don't wear\nunderwear/ We show our pubic hair.\"^[106]^[107]^[note 7] Lucian Truscott\nreported in The Village Voice: \"A stagnant situation there brought on some gay\ntomfoolery in the form of a chorus line facing the line of helmeted and club-\ncarrying cops. Just as the line got into a full kick routine, the TPF advanced\nagain and cleared the crowd of screaming gay power[-]ites down Christopher to\nSeventh Avenue.\"^[108] One participant who had been in the Stonewall during\nthe raid recalled, \"The police rushed us and that's when I realized this is\nnot a good thing to do, because they got me in the back with a nightstick.\"\nAnother account stated, \"I just can't ever get that one sight out of my mind.\nThe cops with the [nightsticks] and the kick line on the other side. It was\nthe most amazing thing ... And all the sudden that kick line, which I guess\nwas a spoof on the machismo ... I think that's when I felt rage. Because\npeople were getting smashed with bats. And for what? A kick line.\"^[109]\n\nMarsha P. Johnson, an African-American street queen,^[110]^[111]^[112]\nrecalled arriving at the bar around \"2:00 [am]\", and that at that point the\nriots were well underway, with the building in flames.^[99] As the riots went\non into the early hours of the morning, Johnson, along with Zazu Nova and\nJackie Hormona, were noted as \"three individuals known to have been in the\nvanguard\" of the pushback against the police.^[113]\n\nCraig Rodwell, owner of the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop, reported watching\npolice chase participants through the crooked streets, only to see them appear\naround the next corner behind the police. Members of the mob stopped cars,\noverturning one of them to block Christopher Street. Jack Nichols and Lige\nClarke, in their column printed in Screw, declared that \"massive crowds of\nangry protesters chased [the police] for blocks screaming, 'Catch\nthem!'\"^[108]\n\nChristopher Park, where many of the demonstrators met after the first night of\nrioting to talk about what had happened. It is now the site of the Gay\nLiberation Monument, featuring a sculpture of four figures by George\nSegal.^[114]\n\nBy 4:00 a.m., the streets had nearly been cleared. Many people sat on stoops\nor gathered nearby in Christopher Park throughout the morning, dazed in\ndisbelief at what had transpired. Many witnesses remembered the surreal and\neerie quiet that descended upon Christopher Street, though there continued to\nbe \"electricity in the air\".^[115] One commented: \"There was a certain beauty\nin the aftermath of the riot ... It was obvious, at least to me, that a lot of\npeople really were gay and, you know, this was our street.\"^[116] Thirteen\npeople had been arrested. Some in the crowd were hospitalized,^[note 8] and\nfour police officers were injured. Almost everything in the Stonewall Inn was\nbroken. Inspector Pine had intended to close and dismantle the Stonewall Inn\nthat night. Pay phones, toilets, mirrors, jukeboxes, and cigarette machines\nwere all smashed, possibly in the riot and possibly by the police.^[102]^[118]\n\n### Second night of rioting[edit]\n\nDuring the siege of the Stonewall, Craig Rodwell called The New York Times,\nthe New York Post, and the Daily News to tell them what was happening. All\nthree papers covered the riots; the Daily News placed coverage on the front\npage. News of the riot spread quickly throughout Greenwich Village, fueled by\nrumors that it had been organized by the Students for a Democratic Society,\nthe Black Panthers, or triggered by \"a homosexual police officer whose\nroommate went dancing at the Stonewall against the officer's wishes\".^[68] All\nday Saturday, June 28, people came to stare at the burned and blackened\nStonewall Inn. Graffiti appeared on the walls of the bar, declaring \"Drag\npower\", \"They invaded our rights\", \"Support gay power\" and \"Legalize gay\nbars\", along with accusations of police looting and\u2014regarding the status of\nthe bar\u2014\"We are open.\"^[68]^[119]\n\nThe next night, rioting again surrounded Christopher Street; participants\nremember differently which night was more frantic or violent. Many of the same\npeople returned from the previous evening\u2014hustlers, street youths, and\n\"queens\"\u2014but they were joined by \"police provocateurs\", curious bystanders,\nand even tourists.^[120] Remarkable to many was the sudden exhibition of\nhomosexual affection in public, as described by one witness: \"From going to\nplaces where you had to knock on a door and speak to someone through a\npeephole in order to get in. We were just out. We were in the streets.\"^[121]\n\nThousands of people had gathered in front of the Stonewall, which had opened\nagain, choking Christopher Street until the crowd spilled into adjoining\nblocks. The throng surrounded buses and cars, harassing the occupants unless\nthey either admitted they were gay or indicated their support for the\ndemonstrators.^[122] Marsha P. Johnson was seen climbing a lamppost and\ndropping a heavy bag onto the hood of a police car, shattering the\nwindshield.^[123]\n\nAs on the previous evening, fires were started in garbage cans throughout the\nneighborhood. More than a hundred police were present from the Fourth, Fifth,\nSixth and Ninth Precincts, but after 2:00 a.m. the TPF arrived again. Kick\nlines and police chases waxed and waned; when police captured demonstrators,\nwhom the majority of witnesses described as \"sissies\" or \"swishes\", the crowd\nsurged to recapture them.^[124] Again, street battling ensued until 4:00\na.m.^[123]\n\nBeat poet and longtime Greenwich Village resident Allen Ginsberg lived on\nChristopher Street and happened upon the jubilant chaos. After he learned of\nthe riot that had occurred the previous evening, he stated, \"Gay power! Isn't\nthat great! ... It's about time we did something to assert ourselves\" and\nvisited the open Stonewall Inn for the first time. While walking home, he\ndeclared to Lucian Truscott, \"You know, the guys there were so\nbeautiful\u2014they've lost that wounded look that fags all had 10 years\nago.\"^[125]\n\n### Leaflets, press coverage, and more violence[edit]\n\nActivity in Greenwich Village was sporadic on Monday and Tuesday, partly due\nto rain. Police and Village residents had a few altercations, as both groups\nantagonized each other. Craig Rodwell and his partner Fred Sargeant took the\nopportunity the morning after the first riot to print and distribute 5,000\nleaflets, one of them reading: \"Get the Mafia and the Cops out of Gay Bars.\"\nThe leaflets called for gay people to own their own establishments, for a\nboycott of the Stonewall and other Mafia-owned bars, and for public pressure\non the mayor's office to investigate the \"intolerable situation\".^[126]^[127]\n\nNot everyone in the gay community considered the revolt a positive\ndevelopment. To many older homosexuals and many members of the Mattachine\nSociety who had worked throughout the 1960s to promote homosexuals as no\ndifferent from heterosexuals, the display of violence and effeminate behavior\nwas embarrassing. Randy Wicker, who had marched in the first gay picket lines\nbefore the White House in 1965, said the \"screaming queens forming chorus\nlines and kicking went against everything that I wanted people to think about\nhomosexuals ... that we were a bunch of drag queens in the Village acting\ndisorderly and tacky and cheap.\"^[128] Others found the closing of the\nStonewall Inn, termed a \"sleaze joint\", as advantageous to the Village.^[129]\n\nOn Wednesday, however, The Village Voice ran reports of the riots, written by\nHoward Smith and Lucian Truscott, that included unflattering descriptions of\nthe events and its participants: \"forces of faggotry\", \"limp wrists\" and\n\"Sunday fag follies\".^[130]^[note 9] A mob descended upon Christopher Street\nonce again and threatened to burn down the offices of The Village Voice, which\nat the time was headquartered several buildings west of the Stonewall Inn on\nChristopher Street; that proximity gave Truscott and other writers for the\nnewspaper first hand observations of the uprising. Also in the mob of between\n500 and 1,000 were other groups that had had unsuccessful confrontations with\nthe police and were curious how the police were defeated in this situation.\nAnother explosive street battle took place, with injuries to demonstrators and\npolice alike, local shops getting looted, and arrests of five\npeople.^[131]^[132] The incidents on Wednesday night lasted about an hour and\nwere summarized by one witness: \"The word is out. Christopher Street shall be\nliberated. The fags have had it with oppression.\"^[133]\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\nThe feeling of urgency spread throughout Greenwich Village, even to people who\nhad not witnessed the riots. Many who were moved by the rebellion attended\norganizational meetings, sensing an opportunity to take action. On July 4,\n1969, the Mattachine Society performed its annual picket in front of\nIndependence Hall in Philadelphia, called the Annual Reminder. Organizers\nCraig Rodwell, Frank Kameny, Randy Wicker, Barbara Gittings, and Kay Lahusen,\nwho had all participated for several years, took a bus along with other\npicketers from New York City to Philadelphia. Since 1965, the pickets had been\nvery controlled: women wore skirts and men wore suits and ties and all marched\nquietly in organized lines.^[134] This year Rodwell remembered feeling\nrestricted by the rules Kameny had set. When two women spontaneously held\nhands, Kameny broke them apart, saying, \"None of that! None of that!\" Rodwell,\nhowever, convinced about ten couples to hold hands. The hand-holding couples\nmade Kameny furious, but they earned more press attention than all of the\nprevious marches.^[135]^[136] Participant Lilli Vincenz remembered, \"It was\nclear that things were changing. People who had felt oppressed now felt\nempowered.\"^[135] Rodwell returned to New York City determined to change the\nestablished quiet, meek ways of trying to get attention. One of his first\npriorities was planning Christopher Street Liberation Day.^[137]\n\nGay rights demonstration in Trafalgar Square, London, including members of the\nGay Liberation Front (GLF). The GLF in the UK held its first meeting in a\nbasement classroom at the London School of Economics on October 13, 1970. The\norganization was very informal, instituting marches and other activities,\nleading to the first British Gay Pride March in 1972.\n\n### Gay Liberation Front[edit]\n\nAlthough the Mattachine Society had existed since the 1950s, many of their\nmethods now seemed too mild for people who had witnessed or been inspired by\nthe riots. Mattachine recognized the shift in attitudes in a story from their\nnewsletter entitled, \"The Hairpin Drop Heard Around the World.\"^[138]^[note\n10] When a Mattachine officer suggested an \"amicable and sweet\" candlelight\nvigil demonstration, a man in the audience fumed and shouted, \"Sweet!\nBullshit! That's the role society has been forcing these queens to\nplay.\"^[139] With a flyer announcing: \"Do You Think Homosexuals Are Revolting?\nYou Bet Your Sweet Ass We Are!\",^[139] the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) was soon\nformed, the first gay organization to use gay in its name. Previous\norganizations such as the Mattachine Society, the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB),\nand various homophile groups had masked their purpose by deliberately choosing\nobscure names.^[140]\n\nThe rise of militancy became apparent to Frank Kameny and Barbara Gittings\u2014who\nhad worked in homophile organizations for years and were both very public\nabout their roles\u2014when they attended a GLF meeting to see the new group. A\nyoung GLF member demanded to know who they were and what their credentials\nwere. Gittings, nonplussed, stammered, \"I'm gay. That's why I'm here.\"^[141]\nThe GLF borrowed tactics from and aligned themselves with black and antiwar\ndemonstrators with the ideal that they \"could work to restructure American\nsociety\".^[142] They took on causes of the Black Panthers, marching to the\nWomen's House of Detention in support of Afeni Shakur and other radical New\nLeft causes. Four months after the group formed, however, it disbanded when\nmembers were unable to agree on operating procedure.^[143]\n\n### Gay Activists Alliance[edit]\n\nWithin six months of the Stonewall riots, activists started a citywide\nnewspaper called Gay; they considered it necessary because the most liberal\npublication in the city\u2014The Village Voice\u2014refused to print the word gay in GLF\nadvertisements seeking new members and volunteers.^[144] Two other newspapers\nwere initiated within a six-week period: Come Out! and Gay Power; the\nreadership of these three periodicals quickly climbed to between 20,000 and\n25,000.^[145]^[146]\n\nGLF members organized several same-sex dances, but GLF meetings were chaotic.\nWhen Bob Kohler asked for clothes and money to help the homeless youth who had\nparticipated in the riots, many of whom slept in Christopher Park or Sheridan\nSquare, the response was a discussion on the downfall of capitalism.^[147] In\nlate December 1969, several people who had visited GLF meetings and left out\nof frustration formed the Gay Activists Alliance (GAA). The GAA was to be more\norderly and entirely focused on gay issues. Their constitution began, \"We as\nliberated homosexual activists demand the freedom for expression of our\ndignity and value as human beings.\"^[148] The GAA developed and perfected a\nconfrontational tactic called a zap: they would catch a politician off guard\nduring a public relations opportunity and force him or her to acknowledge gay\nand lesbian rights. City councilmen were zapped and mayor John Lindsay was\nzapped several times\u2014once on television when GAA members made up the majority\nof the audience.^[149]\n\nPolice raids on gay bars did not stop after the Stonewall riots. In March\n1970, deputy inspector Seymour Pine raided the Zodiac and 17 Barrow Street. An\nafter-hours gay club with no liquor or occupancy licenses called The Snake Pit\nwas soon raided and 167 people were arrested. One of them was Diego Vi\u00f1ales,\nan Argentinian national so frightened that he might be deported as a\nhomosexual that he tried to escape the police precinct by jumping out of a\ntwo-story window, impaling himself on a 14-inch (36 cm) spike fence.^[150] The\nNew York Daily News printed a graphic photo of the young man's impalement on\nthe front page. GAA members organized a march from Christopher Park to the\nSixth Precinct in which hundreds of gay men, lesbians, and liberal\nsympathizers peacefully confronted the TPF.^[145] They also sponsored a\nletter-writing campaign to Mayor Lindsay in which the Greenwich Village\nDemocratic Party and congressman Ed Koch sent pleas to end raids on gay bars\nin the city.^[151]\n\nThe Stonewall Inn lasted only a few weeks after the riot. By October 1969 it\nwas up for rent. Village residents surmised it was too notorious a location\nand Rodwell's boycott discouraged business.^[152]\n\n### Gay Pride[edit]\n\nMain article: NYC Pride March \u00a7 Origins\n\nChristopher Street Liberation Day, on June 28, 1970, marked the first\nanniversary of the Stonewall riots with an assembly on Christopher Street;\nwith simultaneous Gay Pride marches in Los Angeles and Chicago, these were the\nfirst Gay Pride marches in US history.^[153]^[154] The next year, Gay Pride\nmarches took place in Boston, Dallas, Milwaukee, London, Paris, West Berlin\nand Stockholm.^[155] The march in New York covered 51 blocks, from Christopher\nStreet to Central Park. The march took less than half the scheduled time due\nto excitement, but also due to wariness about walking through the city with\ngay banners and signs. Although the parade permit was delivered only two hours\nbefore the start of the march, the marchers encountered little resistance from\nonlookers.^[156] The New York Times reported (on the front page) that the\nmarchers took up the entire street for about 15 city blocks.^[157] Reporting\nby The Village Voice was positive, describing \"the out-front resistance that\ngrew out of the police raid on the Stonewall Inn one year ago\".^[155]\n\n> There was little open animosity and some bystanders applauded when a tall,\n> pretty girl carrying a sign \"I am a Lesbian\" walked by.\n\n\u2014The New York Times coverage of Gay Liberation Day, 1970^[157]\n\nBy 1972, the participating cities included Atlanta, Buffalo, Detroit,\nWashington, D.C., Miami, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia,^[158] as well as San\nFrancisco.\n\nFrank Kameny soon realized the pivotal change brought by the Stonewall riots.\nAn organizer of gay activism in the 1950s, he was used to persuasion, trying\nto convince heterosexuals that gay people were no different from them. When he\nand other people marched in front of the White House, the State Department,\nand Independence Hall only five years earlier, their objective was to look as\nif they could work for the US government.^[159] Ten people marched with Kameny\nthen and they alerted no press to their intentions. Although he was stunned by\nthe upheaval by participants in the Annual Reminder in 1969, he later\nobserved, \"By the time of Stonewall, we had fifty to sixty gay groups in the\ncountry. A year later there were at least fifteen hundred. By two years later,\nto the extent that a count could be made, it was twenty-five hundred.\"^[160]\n\nSimilar to Kameny's regret at his own reaction to the shift in attitudes after\nthe riots, Randy Wicker came to describe his embarrassment as \"one of the\ngreatest mistakes of his life\".^[161] The image of gay people retaliating\nagainst police, after so many years of allowing such treatment to go\nunchallenged, \"stirred an unexpected spirit among many homosexuals\".^[161] Kay\nLahusen, who photographed the marches in 1965, stated, \"Up to 1969, this\nmovement was generally called the homosexual or homophile movement ... Many\nnew activists consider the Stonewall uprising the birth of the gay liberation\nmovement. Certainly, it was the birth of gay pride on a massive scale.\"^[162]\nDavid Carter explained that even though there were several uprisings before\nStonewall, the reason Stonewall was so significant was that thousands of\npeople were involved, the riot lasted a long time (six days), it was the first\nto get major media coverage, and it sparked the formation of many gay rights\ngroups.^[163]\n\n### Trans organizations[edit]\n\nAccording to Susan Stryker's book, Transgender History, the Stonewall riots\nhad significant effects on trans rights activism. Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P.\nJohnson established the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR)\norganization, as they believed that trans people weren't being adequately\nrepresented in the Gay Activists Alliance and Gay Liberation Front. They\nestablished politicized versions of \"houses\", which came from Black and Latino\nqueer communities, and were places that marginalized trans youth could seek\nshelter.^[164]\n\nBesides STAR, organizations such as Transvestites and Transsexuals (TAT) and\nQueens' Liberation Front (QLF) were also established. QLF, which was\nestablished by drag queen Lee Brewster and heterosexual transvestite Bunny\nEisenhower, marched on Christopher Street Liberation Day and fought against\ndrag erasure and for trans visibility.^[164]\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\nThe Stonewall riots are often considered to be the origin or impetus of the\ngay liberation movement, and many studies of LGBT history in the U.S. are\ndivided into pre- and post-Stonewall analyses.^[158] This has been criticized\nby historians of sexuality. Calls for the rights of gender and sexual\nminorities predate the Stonewall riots,^[note 11] and there was already the\nemergence of a gay liberation movement in New York at the time of the riots.\nThe Stonewall riots were not the only time LGBT people organized politically\namid attacks on LGBT establishments. The event has been said to occupy a\nunique place in the collective memory of many LGBT people,^[158] including\nthose outside of the United States,^[165] as it \"is marked by an international\ncommemorative ritual \u2013 an annual gay pride parade\", according to sociologist\nElizabeth A. Armstrong.^[158]\n\n### Community[edit]\n\nBanner reading \"Stonewall was a riot\" pictured during Berlin Pride, 2009\n\nWithin two years of the Stonewall riots, there were gay rights groups in every\nmajor American city, as well as in Canada, Australia, and Western\nEurope.^[166] People who joined activist organizations after the riots had\nvery little in common other than their same-sex attraction. Many who arrived\nat GLF or GAA meetings were taken aback by the number of gay people in one\nplace.^[167] Race, class, ideology, and gender became frequent obstacles in\nthe years after the riots. This was illustrated during the 1973 Stonewall\nrally when, moments after Barbara Gittings exuberantly praised the diversity\nof the crowd, feminist activist Jean O'Leary protested what she perceived as\nthe mocking of women by cross-dressers and drag queens in attendance. During a\nspeech by O'Leary, in which she claimed that drag queens made fun of women for\nentertainment value and profit, Sylvia Rivera and Lee Brewster jumped on the\nstage and shouted \"You go to bars because of what drag queens did for you and\nthese bitches tell us to quit being ourselves!\"^[168] Both the drag queens and\nlesbian feminists in attendance left in disgust.^[169]\n\nQueer anarchists at Stockholm pride with banner reading \"Remember Stonewall\"\n\nO'Leary also worked in the early 1970s to exclude transgender people from gay\nrights issues because she felt that rights for transgender people would be too\ndifficult to attain.^[169] Sylvia Rivera left New York City in the mid-1970s,\nrelocating to upstate New York.^[170] She later returned to the city in the\nmid-1990s, after the 1992 death of friend Marsha P. Johnson. Rivera lived on\nthe \"gay pier\" at the end of Christopher street and advocated for homeless\nmembers of the gay community.^[170]^[171] The initial disagreements among\nparticipants in the movements often evolved after further reflection. O'Leary\nlater regretted her stance against the drag queens attending in 1973: \"Looking\nback, I find this so embarrassing because my views have changed so much since\nthen. I would never pick on a transvestite now.\"^[169] \"It was horrible. How\ncould I work to exclude transvestites and at the same time criticize the\nfeminists who were doing their best back in those days to exclude\nlesbians?\"^[172]\n\nO'Leary was referring to the Lavender Menace, an appellation by second-wave\nfeminist Betty Friedan based on attempts by members of the National\nOrganization for Women (NOW) to distance themselves from the perception of NOW\nas a haven for lesbians. As part of this process, Rita Mae Brown and other\nlesbians who had been active in NOW were forced out. They staged a protest in\n1970 at the Second Congress to Unite Women and earned the support of many NOW\nmembers, finally gaining full acceptance in 1971.^[173]\n\nThe growth of lesbian feminism in the 1970s at times so conflicted with the\ngay liberation movement that some lesbians refused to work with gay men. Many\nlesbians found men's attitudes patriarchal and chauvinistic and saw in gay men\nthe same misguided notions about women that they saw in heterosexual\nmen.^[174] The issues most important to gay men\u2014entrapment and public\nsolicitation\u2014were not shared by lesbians. In 1977, a Lesbian Pride Rally was\norganized as an alternative to sharing gay men's issues, especially what\nAdrienne Rich termed \"the violent, self-destructive world of the gay\nbars\".^[174] Veteran gay activist Barbara Gittings chose to work in the gay\nrights movement, explaining, \"It's a matter of where does it hurt the most?\nFor me it hurts the most not in the female arena, but the gay arena.\"^[174]\n\nThroughout the 1970s, gay activism had significant successes. One of the first\nand most important was the \"zap\" in May 1970 by the Los Angeles GLF at a\nconvention of the American Psychiatric Association (APA). At a conference on\nbehavior modification, during a film demonstrating the use of electroshock\ntherapy to decrease same-sex attraction, Morris Kight and GLF members in the\naudience interrupted the film with shouts of \"Torture!\" and \"Barbarism!\"^[175]\nThey took over the microphone to announce that medical professionals who\nprescribed such therapy for their homosexual patients were complicit in\ntorturing them. Although 20 psychiatrists in attendance left, the GLF spent\nthe hour following the zap with those remaining, trying to convince them that\nhomosexual people were not mentally ill.^[175] When the APA invited gay\nactivists to speak to the group in 1972, activists brought John E. Fryer, a\ngay psychiatrist who wore a mask, because he felt his practice was in danger.\nIn December 1973\u2014in large part due to the efforts of gay activists\u2014the APA\nvoted unanimously to remove homosexuality from the Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual.^[176]^[177]\n\nGay men and lesbians came together to work in grassroots political\norganizations responding to organized resistance in 1977. A coalition of\nconservatives named Save Our Children staged a campaign to repeal a civil\nrights ordinance in Miami-Dade County. Save Our Children was successful enough\nto influence similar repeals in several American cities in 1978. However, that\nsame year, a campaign in California called the Briggs Initiative, designed to\nforce the dismissal of homosexual public school employees, was defeated.^[178]\nReaction to the influence of Save Our Children and the Briggs Initiative in\nthe gay community was so significant that it has been called the second\nStonewall for many activists, marking their initiation into political\nparticipation.^[179] The subsequent 1979 National March on Washington for\nLesbian and Gay Rights was timed to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the\nStonewall riots.^[180]\n\n### Rejection of prior gay subculture[edit]\n\nThe Stonewall riots marked such a significant turning point that many aspects\nof prior gay and lesbian culture, such as bar culture formed from decades of\nshame and secrecy, were forcefully ignored and denied. Historian Martin\nDuberman writes, \"The decades preceding Stonewall ... continue to be regarded\nby most gay men and lesbians as some vast neolithic wasteland.\"^[181]\nSociologist Barry Adam notes, \"Every social movement must choose at some point\nwhat to retain and what to reject out of its past. What traits are the results\nof oppression and what are healthy and authentic?\"^[182] In conjunction with\nthe growing feminist movement of the early 1970s, roles of butch and femme\nthat developed in lesbian bars in the 1950s and 1960s were rejected, because\nas one writer put it: \"all role playing is sick.\"^[183] Lesbian feminists\nconsidered the butch roles as archaic imitations of masculine behavior.^[184]\nSome women, according to Lillian Faderman, were eager to shed the roles they\nfelt forced into playing. The roles returned for some women in the 1980s,\nalthough they allowed for more flexibility than before Stonewall.^[185]\n\nAuthor Michael Bronski highlights the \"attack on pre-Stonewall culture\",\nparticularly gay pulp fiction for men, where the themes often reflected self-\nhatred or ambivalence about being gay. Many books ended unsatisfactorily and\ndrastically, often with suicide, and writers portrayed their gay characters as\nalcoholics or deeply unhappy. These books, which he describes as \"an enormous\nand cohesive literature by and for gay men\",^[186] have not been reissued and\nare lost to later generations. Dismissing the notion that the rejection was\nmotivated by political correctness, Bronski writes, \"gay liberation was a\nyouth movement whose sense of history was defined to a large degree by\nrejection of the past.\"^[187]\n\n### Impact and recognition[edit]\n\nThe modern Stonewall Inn, occupying one of the original Stonewall Inn's two\nbuildings. The buildings and the surrounding streets have been declared a\nNational Historic Landmark.\n\nThe riots spawned from a bar raid became a literal example of gay men and\nlesbians fighting back and a symbolic call to arms for many people. Historian\nDavid Carter remarks in his book about the Stonewall riots that the bar itself\nwas a complex business that represented a community center, an opportunity for\nthe Mafia to blackmail its own customers, a home, and a place of \"exploitation\nand degradation\".^[188] The true legacy of the Stonewall riots, Carter\ninsists, is the \"ongoing struggle for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender\nequality\".^[189] Historian Nicholas Edsall writes:^[190]\n\n> Stonewall has been compared to any number of acts of radical protest and\n> defiance in American history from the Boston Tea Party on. But the best and\n> certainly a more nearly contemporary analogy is Rosa Parks' refusal to move\n> to the back of the bus in Montgomery, Alabama, in December 1955, which\n> sparked the modern civil rights movement. Within months after Stonewall,\n> radical gay liberation groups and newsletters sprang up in cities and on\n> college campuses across America and then across all of northern Europe as\n> well.\n\nBefore the rebellion at the Stonewall Inn, homosexuals were, as historians\nDudley Clendinen and Adam Nagourney write:^[191]\n\n> a secret legion of people, known of but discounted, ignored, laughed at or\n> despised. And like the holders of a secret, they had an advantage which was\n> a disadvantage too, and which was true of no other minority group in the\n> United States. They were invisible. Unlike African Americans, women, Native\n> Americans, Jews, the Irish, Italians, Asians, Hispanics, or any other\n> cultural group which struggled for respect and equal rights, homosexuals had\n> no physical or cultural markings, no language or dialect which could\n> identify them to each other, or to anyone else ... But that night, for the\n> first time, the usual acquiescence turned into violent resistance ... From\n> that night the lives of millions of gay men and lesbians and the attitude\n> toward them of the larger culture in which they lived, began to change\n> rapidly. People began to appear in public as homosexuals, demanding respect.\n\nHistorian Lillian Faderman calls the riots the \"shot heard round the world\",\nexplaining, \"The Stonewall Rebellion was crucial because it sounded the rally\nfor that movement. It became an emblem of gay and lesbian power. By calling on\nthe dramatic tactic of violent protest that was being used by other oppressed\ngroups, the events at the Stonewall implied that homosexuals had as much\nreason to be disaffected as they.\"^[192]\n\nJoan Nestle co-founded the Lesbian Herstory Archives in 1974 and credits \"its\ncreation to that night and the courage that found its voice in the\nstreets.\"^[138] Cautious, however, not to attribute the start of gay activism\nto the Stonewall riots, Nestle writes:\n\n> I certainly don't see gay and lesbian history starting with Stonewall ...\n> and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do see is a\n> historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human\n> beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure ...\n> Certainly, something special happened on that night in 1969 and we've made\n> it more special in our need to have what I call a point of origin ... it's\n> more complex than saying that it all started with Stonewall.^[193]\n\nThe events of the early morning of June 28, 1969, were not the first instances\nof gay men and lesbians fighting back against police in New York City and\nelsewhere. Not only had the Mattachine Society been active in major cities\nsuch as Los Angeles and Chicago, but similarly marginalized people started the\nriot at Compton's Cafeteria in 1966 and another riot responded to a raid on\nLos Angeles' Black Cat Tavern in 1967.^[194] However, several circumstances\nwere in play that made the Stonewall riots memorable. The location of the\nLower Manhattan raid was a factor: it was across the street from The Village\nVoice offices, and the narrow crooked streets gave the rioters an advantage\nover the police.^[158] Many of the participants and residents of Greenwich\nVillage were involved in political organizations that were effectively able to\nmobilize a large and cohesive gay community in the weeks and months after the\nrebellion. The most significant facet of the Stonewall riots, however, was the\ncommemoration of them in Christopher Street Liberation Day, which grew into\nthe annual Gay Pride events around the world.^[158]\n\nStonewall (officially Stonewall Equality Limited) is an LGBT rights charity in\nthe United Kingdom, founded in 1989 and named after the Stonewall Inn because\nof the Stonewall riots. The Stonewall Awards is an annual event the charity\nhas held since 2006 to recognize people who have affected the lives of British\nlesbian, gay, and bisexual people.\n\nThe middle of the 1990s was marked by the inclusion of bisexuals as a\nrepresented group within the gay community, when they successfully sought to\nbe included on the platform of the 1993 March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay\nand Bi Equal Rights and Liberation. Transgender people also asked to be\nincluded but were not, though trans-inclusive language was added to the\nmarch's list of demands.^[195] The transgender community continued to find\nitself simultaneously welcome and at odds with the gay community as attitudes\nabout non-binary gender discrimination and pansexual orientation developed and\ncame increasingly into conflict.^[42]^[196] In 1994, New York City celebrated\n\"Stonewall 25\" with a march that went past the United Nations Headquarters and\ninto Central Park. Estimates put the attendance at 1.1 million people.^[197]\nSylvia Rivera led an alternate march in New York City in 1994 to protest the\nexclusion of transgender people from the events.^[198]\n\nAttendance at LGBT Pride events has grown substantially over the decades. Most\nlarge cities around the world now have some kind of Pride demonstration; Pride\nevents in some cities mark the largest annual celebration of any kind.^[198]\nThe growing trend towards commercializing marches into parades\u2014with events\nreceiving corporate sponsorship\u2014has caused concern about taking away the\nautonomy of the original grassroots demonstrations.^[198]\n\nIn Paris (France), town square commemorating the Stonewall Riots\n\nPresident Barack Obama declared June 2009 Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and\nTransgender Pride Month, citing the riots as a reason to \"commit to achieving\nequal justice under law for LGBT Americans\".^[199] The year marked the 40th\nanniversary of the riots. An editorial in the Washington Blade compared the\nscruffy, violent activism during and following the Stonewall riots to the\nlackluster response to failed promises given by President Obama; for being\nignored, wealthy LGBT activists reacted by promising to give less money to\nDemocratic causes.^[200] Two years later, the Stonewall Inn served as a\nrallying point for celebrations after the New York State Senate voted to pass\nsame-sex marriage. The act was signed into law by Governor Andrew Cuomo on\nJune 24, 2011.^[201]\n\nObama also referenced the Stonewall riots in a call for full equality during\nhis second inaugural address on January 21, 2013:\n\n> We, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths\u2014that all of us\n> are created equal\u2014is the star that guides us still; just as it guided our\n> forebears through Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall ... Our journey is\n> not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else\n> under the law\u2014for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we\n> commit to one another must be equal as well.^[202]\n\nThis was a historic moment: the first time that a president mentioned gay\nrights or the word \"gay\" in an inaugural address.^[202]^[203]\n\nThroughout June 2019, Stonewall 50 \u2013 WorldPride NYC 2019, produced by Heritage\nof Pride in partnership with the I Love New York program's LGBT division, took\nplace in New York to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall\nuprising. The final official estimate included 5 million visitors attending in\nManhattan alone, making it the largest LGBTQ celebration in history.^[13] June\nis traditionally Pride month in New York City and worldwide, and the events\nwere held under the auspices of the annual NYC Pride March. On June 6, 2019,\ncoinciding with WorldPride being celebrated in New York City, Police\nCommissioner James P. O'Neill apologized on behalf of the NYPD for the actions\nof its officers at the Stonewall uprising.^[14]^[15]\n\nThe official 50th-anniversary commemoration of the Stonewall Uprising occurred\non June 28 on Christopher Street in front of Stonewall Inn. The official\ncommemoration was themed as a rally, in reference to the original rallies in\nfront of Stonewall Inn in 1969. Speakers at this event included mayor Bill De\nBlasio, senator Kirsten Gillibrand, congressman Jerry Nadler, American\nactivist X Gonz\u00e1lez, and global activist R\u00e9my Bonny.^[204]^[205]\n\nIn 2019, Paris, France, officially named a square in the Marais district as\nPlace des \u00c9meutes-de-Stonewall^[206] (Stonewall Riots Place).\n\n#### Stonewall Day[edit]\n\nStonewall Day logo by Pride Live\n\nIn 2018, 49 years after the uprising, Stonewall Day was announced as a\ncommemoration day by Pride Live, a social advocacy and community engagement\norganization.^[207]^[208] The second Stonewall Day was held on Friday, June\n28, 2019, outside the Stonewall Inn.^[209] During this event, Pride Live\nintroduced their Stonewall Ambassadors program, to raise awareness for the\n50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots.^[210]\n\n### Historic landmark and monument[edit]\n\nMain article: Stonewall National Monument\n\nA banner hanging from the top of the building the day after President Obama\nannounced creation of the Stonewall National MonumentPlaque commemorating the\nStonewall Riots\n\nIn June 1999, the US Department of the Interior included 51 and 53 Christopher\nStreet and the surrounding area in Greenwich Village into the National\nRegister of Historic Places, the first of significance to the LGBT\ncommunity.^[211]^[212] In a dedication ceremony, Assistant Secretary of the\nDepartment of the Interior John Berry stated, \"Let it forever be remembered\nthat here\u2014on this spot\u2014men and women stood proud, they stood fast, so that we\nmay be who we are, we may work where we will, live where we choose, and love\nwhom our hearts desire.\"^[213] The Stonewall Inn was also named a National\nHistoric Landmark in February 2000.^[214]\n\nOn June 23, 2015, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission\ndesignated Stonewall as a city landmark, the first to be designated based on\nits LGBT cultural significance alone.^[215] On June 24, 2016, President Barack\nObama announced the establishment of the Stonewall National Monument,\nadministered by the National Park Service.^[216] The designation protects\nChristopher Park and adjacent areas totaling more than seven acres; the\nStonewall Inn is within the boundaries of the monument but remains privately\nowned.^[217] The National Park Foundation formed a new nonprofit organization\nto raise funds for a ranger station and interpretive exhibits for the\nmonument,^[218] including a visitor center that is expected to be completed in\n2024.^[219]\n\n## Media representations[edit]\n\nNo newsreel or TV footage was taken of the riots and few home movies and\nphotographs exist, but those that do have been used in documentaries.^[220]\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n  * Before Stonewall: The Making of a Gay and Lesbian Community (1984), a documentary on the decades leading up to the Stonewall Rebellion\n  * Stonewall (1995), a dramatic presentation of the events leading up to the riots\n  * After Stonewall (1999), a documentary of the years from Stonewall to the century's end\n  * Stonewall Uprising (2010), a documentary using archival footage, photographs, documents, and witness statements\n  * Stonewall (2015), a drama about a fictional protagonist who interacts with fictionalized versions of some of the people in and around the riots\n  * Happy Birthday, Marsha!

Later ('70s/80s) this was expanded by many groups to lesbian and gay, then by the '90s and '00s to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT). Also by the late eighties and early nineties, queer began to be reclaimed as a one-word alternative to the ever-lengthening initialism, especially when used by radical political groups.^[3] \"GCN's Stonewall tenth anniversary issue, showing a plaque repeatedly posted by activists at the site of the riots and removed by the building's owner.

In 1971, twenty states had 'sex psychopath' laws that permitted the detaining of homosexuals for that reason alone. In Pennsylvania and California sex offenders could be committed to a psychiatric institution for life and [in] seven states they could be castrated.\"^[16] Through the 1950s and 1960s, castration, emetics, hypnosis, electroshock therapy and lobotomies were used by psychiatrists to try to \"cure\" homosexuals.^[17]^[18]\n  3. ^ Accounts of people who witnessed the scene, including letters and news reports of the woman who fought with police, conflicted. Where witnesses claim one woman who fought her treatment at the hands of the police caused the crowd to become angry, some also remembered several \"butch lesbians\" had begun to fight back while still in the bar. At least one was already bleeding when taken out of the bar.^[83] Craig Rodwell^[84] claims the arrest of the woman was not the primary event that triggered the violence, but one of several simultaneous occurrences: \"there was just ... a flash of group\u2014of mass\u2014anger.\"\n  4. ^ Witness Morty Manford stated, \"There's no doubt in my mind that those people were deliberately left unguarded. I assume there was some sort of relationship between the bar management and the local police, so they really didn't want to arrest those people. But they had to at least look like they were doing their jobs.\"^[88]\n  5. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b In the years since the riots occurred, the death of gay icon Judy Garland earlier in the week on June 22, 1969 has been attributed as a significant factor in the riots, but no participants in Saturday morning's demonstrations recall Garland's name being discussed. No print accounts of the riots by reliable sources cite Garland as a reason for the riot. Only one contemporary account suggested it, an account by a heterosexual person ridiculing the riots.^[92] Bob Kohler used to talk to the homeless youth in Sheridan Square and said, \"When people talk about Judy Garland's death having anything much to do with the riot, that makes me crazy. The street kids faced death every day. They had nothing to lose. And they couldn't have cared less about Judy. We're talking about kids who were fourteen, fifteen, sixteen. Judy Garland was the middle-aged darling of the middle-class gays. I get upset about this because it trivializes the whole thing.\"^[93]\n  6. ^ Sylvia Rivera reported being handed a Molotov cocktail and throwing it (there were no eyewitness accounts of Molotov cocktails the first night although many fires were set).^[98] In 2019, David Carter admitted that this account of Rivera's actions was fabricated and that multiple witnesses over the years, including Marsha P. Johnson, had all agreed that Rivera had not been present at the uprising.^[100]^[101] Bob Kohler told Carter that although Rivera had not been at the uprising, he hoped that Carter would still portray her as having been there. Another Stonewall veteran, Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt, claimed that he wanted Carter to include Rivera \"so that young Puerto Rican transgender people on the street would have a role model.\"^[100] When Kohler and Rivera had a discussion over whether Kohler would back Rivera's claims to Carter for the book, Rivera asked Kohler to say that Rivera threw a Molotov cocktail. Kohler responded, \"Sylvia, you didn't throw a Molotov cocktail!\" Rivera continued to bargain with him, asking if he'd say she threw the first brick. He replied, \"Sylvia, you didn't throw a brick.\" The first bottle? He still refused. Finally, Kohler agreed to lie and say Rivera had been there and had at some point thrown a bottle.^[100]\n  7. ^ Some references have the last line as \"... pubic hairs\" instead.\n  8. ^ One protester needed stitches to repair a knee broken by a nightstick; another lost two fingers in a car door.
