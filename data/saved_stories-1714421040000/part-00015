It is my\nmission, nay, my DUTY, to set the record straight.\n\nTristan Greaves\n\nApr 29, 2024\n\n2\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Commodore Amiga was the COOLEST\n\nwww.techinterrupt.com\n\n3\n\nShare\n\nDominik Diamond is the GamesMaster host of our hearts. He didn\u2019t have a lot of\ncompetition, to be fair, with Dexter Fletcher flirting with the role for\nSeason 3. And look how Dexter ended up! A mere celebrated actor and director\n(Including Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman). Whereas Dominik is outclassing\nhim as a DJ on Toronto radio. Suck it up, Dexter.\n\nGamesMaster was an innuendo-filled video games show that aired 1992 to 1998.\nIt was aimed at children, featuring challenges, reviews and tips. It means I\nwill forever associate Dominik Diamond with video games. And lines such as,\n\u201cRemember folks: Life is a bit like a mountain bike - tough going up hill, but\nfantastic going down.\u201d\n\nAs such, I was shocked (SHOCKED, I tell you) to read Dominik\u2019s latest column,\nwhere although he professes his love for the Commodore Amiga, he considered it\n\u2018painfully uncool\u2019. How could he do this to us?! After all these years?!\n\nIf any man could possibly understand cool, IT IS THIS ONE. Screen capture from\nGamesMaster itself, some time in the 1990s.\n\nAs such, I am contractually bound to spend some time giving the case for the\ndefence. Readers, I present to you: REASONS WHY THE COMMODORE AMIGA WAS\nEXTREMELY VERY COOL INDEED.\n\n#\n\nNot an Atari ST\n\nWe need to get this one out of the way. In the 16-bit computer era, the Amiga\nwas mostly competing against the Atari ST. Was it really a competition? The\nAtari ST wasn\u2019t great. It won over musicians a bit as it had a MIDI port as\nstandard, but everything else was just... painful. I\u2019m not mad or angry or\nupset about the Atari: Just disappointed.\n\nIn a world full of sadness, there just isn\u2019t anything sadder than the Atari\u2019s\nGEM Desktop. I mean, just look at it. It\u2019s practically weeping through the\nscreen.\n\nVERDICT: Cool by default.\n\nSad. So sad.\n\n#\n\nThe One That Wasn\u2019t The Amiga A500\n\nMost people familiar with the Amiga will be thinking of the Amiga 500. It was\nindeed grey and drab. It was the computer equivalent of what you get when you\nask a 5 year-old to draw a picture of a car.\n\nI was lucky enough to get upgraded to the Amiga 1200 one Christmas. Now THIS\nwas more like it. I mean, just look at it! Angular. Sleek. And the coolest\nthings lay under the hood: AGA chipset (better graphics), and the ability to\nslide in your very own hard disk. Which I did, and it changed my life: Going\nfrom swapping floppy disks every five seconds to having 540 megabytes of hard\ndisk space was the stuff of dreams.\n\nOh, and it was so cool that Calvin Harris whipped his out to perform at the\nBrit Awards this year.\n\nVERDICT: Reassuringly Cool.\n\nThis is an absolutely gorgeous slab of technology. Put it up on the wall.\n\n#\n\nA World of Friendship\n\nIf something is truly cool, you don\u2019t mind your mates knowing about it.\n\nSensible World of Soccer was the game that solidified that connection between\nthe Amiga and your friends. It was absurdly playable. Many a joystick was\nwaggled to its demise, or hurled against a wall, due to this game. Bedrooms\nbecame tournament battlegrounds.\n\nSuch is the ongoing coolness of this game, competitions are STILL held yearly\n(Take that, EA Sports!), and unofficial updates are made to the game to keep\nleague structures up to date.\n\nVERDICT: Sensibly Cool.\n\nSTICK THAT IN YOUR GOAL HOLE.\n\n#\n\nThe Sound of Success\n\nSay hello to Paula, the Amiga\u2019s custom sound chip.\n\nPaula allowed four-channel sound and up to 29k samples per second. This meant\none thing: The Amiga sounded SUPERB!\n\nMusic sounded like music, not the beeps and bops of 8-bit computers. Proper\ninstrumental samples could be used to great effect. And not just by Calvin\nHarris.\n\nIf you have three hours to kill, there\u2019s a great compilation of Amiga music\navailable to listen to via YouTube. Playlists and albums are abound on\nSpotify. The vertically scrolling \u2018tracker\u2019 approach to music production is\nstill in use today.\n\nVERDICT: Aurally Cool.\n\nAn example of a \u2018tracker\u2019, where music could be created for the Amiga.\n\n#\n\nThe Scene\n\nAs a teenager, one of the main things that got my heart racing was a stuffed\njiffy bag popping through my letterbox.\n\nThe Amiga was a hotbed of public domain (PD) software. Owners would write\nsoftware of all sorts, for fun, and then give it away. I was really lucky to\nlive a bike ride away from a shop that actually sold PD software (basically\ncharging for the disks and the service). My mind was blown by the sheer\nvariety of stuff on offer: Graphical demos, music disks, games... hundreds if\nnot thousands of disks were available.\n\nThere are too many demos to highlight here, but one of the classics was State\nof the Art by demo group Spaceballs. You can watch it on YouTube. In fact, you\nshould do that RIGHT NOW.\n\nThis was all pre-Internet. Trading of software was by post, hence jiffy bags\nwere the weapon of choice. Covering them with multiple layers of parcel tape\nfor longevity was a standard trick. I even got my very own rubber stamp made\nto save time when sending out packages.... and come on, what could be cooler\nthan THAT?\n\nI graduated from having my very own collection of hundreds of disks built up\nover time, to creating my own (admittedly very simple) scene productions,\nteaming up with total strangers met via the wonders of Royal Mail.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just about the floppy disks, either. In some cases, pen pals were\nmade, with pages of writing (and later dot matrix printing) accompanying each\ntrove of digital delight.\n\nVERDICT: Stuffed full of Cool.\n\nI MADE THIS.\n\n#\n\nThe X Factor\n\nThe image that accompanies this section, of X-Copy Professional, will stir the\nheart, or even loins, of anyone who owned an Amiga. Even if they are now a\ndead inside 40-something adult.\n\nX-Copy was THE disk copying tool for the Amiga. A sea of green zeros meant\nsuccess. Those games were now YOURS to take from your mate\u2019s house back home\nto enjoy at your leisure.\n\nOf course, this was only used for the aforementioned public domain titles. It\nwould never, EVER be used for any pirated and therefore illegal software. Not\neven once.\n\nVERDICT: Suspiciously Cool (Doubly cool if you owned an external disk drive to\nmake this process even quicker).\n\n#\n\nAmiga Power\n\nThe Amiga had a decent selection of paper magazines at is peak. Some were all\nvery grown up and professional. Some concentrated more squarely on the games.\nThe one that stood above them all, like a colossus, was Amiga Power. It was\nThe Fonz of computer magazines.\n\nAmiga Power existed for 65 issues. It oozed cool due to the irreverent,\npersonal style that ran through each copy of the magazine. Strange anecdotes,\ninterviews done in weird styles just for the fun of it, it was all going on. I\nread a LOT of computer magazines in my formative years (some surprise, right?)\nand I can point to them for how my own writing style came about. Or blame\nthem.\n\nSuch was the impact of this magazine is that every single issue has been\narchived on the Internet and can be downloaded. You should read all of them.\n\nVERDICT: Rebelliously Cool.\n\n#\n\nI heard it on the Grapevine\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all about the paper. Now, Grapevine was not the only disk magazine\nfor the Amiga. It was, however, the most ubiquitous. It spanned 21 releases in\nthe end, packed full of content on... to be honest, everything imaginable.\nScene news? Sure. Game reviews? Expected. How to hypnotise people and get free\nphone calls? Let\u2019s have some of that as well. I always eagerly anticipated\neach new release, and you could send in blank floppy disks to be one of the\nfirst to get a copy.\n\nI even have some of my own articles immortalised in there somewhere.\n\nVERDICT: Swaggeringly cool.\n\n#\n\nCopyright disputes are cool\n\nEveryone loves a good ol\u2019 corporate dispute nowadays.\n\nCommodore announced bankruptcy in 1994. Its assets were purchased by Escom,\nwho celebrated by themselves going bust in 1996. Gateway 2000 then snapped\neverything up, only to sell it all after three years. It\u2019s hard to pinpoint\nexactly who owns the Amiga in the present day. Books could be written on the\nsubject, and probably have been. It seems to be a fist fight (yes, actual\ncourt action) between Amiga Inc, Hyperion and Cloanto. There are now divergent\nreleases of the Amiga Operating System (is 3.9 a later release than 3.2? Good\nluck making a decision, as they are by different developers!).\n\nVERDICT: Legally Cool.\n\nIs this CD even legal?\n\n#\n\nCan\u2019t stop the re-issues\n\nFinally, if you missed out first time around, don\u2019t worry: Someone managed to\ncut through the legal challenges and snag the rights to create a cute re-issue\nof the Amiga hardware in recent times.\n\nTHEA500 Mini (Weird spacing intentional) is essentially an Amiga emulator in a\nbox. It\u2019s tiny, connects to your TV, and comes with 25 classic games off the\nbat. You can install additional games at your leisure. You even get a mouse\nand joypad thrown in.\n\nNostalgia is the coolest thing of all.\n\nVERDICT: Compressed Cool.\n\nProbably actual size.\n\nShare\n\n2\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Commodore Amiga was the COOLEST\n\nwww.techinterrupt.com\n\n3\n\nShare\n\n3 Comments\n\nLord protector3 hrs agoLiked by Tristan GreavesI had an amiga 600 /1200 and a\nfew months ago purchased an amiga 4000d and upgraded to 060 and mediator and\n3.2.2.1 roms I spend more time on it than my pc / linux machine, im hope to\nget into programming and update software for this great machine that will\nnever die.All hail the amiga \ud83d\ude4cExpand full commentLike (2)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 reply by Tristan Greaves\n\nLord protector2 hrs ago\u00b7edited 2 hrs agoLiked by Tristan GreavesIt's in\nstandard 4000d case but I upgraded to the bfg9060 rev 6 running at 100mhz\n128mb ram on board , I added 2x 256mb zorro 3 ram cards I have added a radeon\n9250 128mb card I use for the graphics via dvi on card to hdmi on my 42\" TV\nand if gives me 93 mb of that ram as system memory as well 2mb chip and 16mb\non board mediator 4000i with the pci slots radeon, networking, sb128 card and\nusb spider card 128gb ssd cardExpand full commentLike (1)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 more comment...\n\nIs your fitness data making you happy, citizen?\n\nOur personal devices are capturing, analysing and reporting on more fitness\nmetrics than ever before.
