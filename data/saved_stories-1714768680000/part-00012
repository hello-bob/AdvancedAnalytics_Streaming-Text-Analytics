To better\nunderstand how cells perform the essential functions of life, scientists have\nbegun developing synthetic cells \u2013 non-living bits of cellular biochemistry\nwrapped in a membrane that mimic specific biological processes.\n\nThe development of synthetic cells could one day hold the answers to\ndeveloping new ways to fight disease, supporting long-duration human\nspaceflight, and better understanding the origins of life on Earth.\n\nIn a paper published recently in ACS Synthetic Biology, researchers outline\nthe potential opportunities that synthetic cell development could unlock and\nwhat challenges lie ahead in this groundbreaking research. They also present a\nroadmap to inspire and guide innovation in this intriguing field.\n\n\u201cThe potential for this field is incredible,\u201d said Lynn Rothschild, the lead\nauthor of the paper and an astrobiologist at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center in\nCalifornia\u2019s Silicon Valley. \u201cIt\u2019s a privilege to have led this group in\nforming what we envision will be a founding document, a resource that will\nspur this field on.\u201d\n\nSynthetic cell development could have wide ranging benefits to humanity.\nAnalyzing the intricacies that go in to building a cell could guide\nresearchers to better understand how cells first evolved or open the door to\ncreating new forms of life more capable of withstanding harsh environments\nlike radiation or freezing temperatures.\n\nThese innovations could also lead to advancements in food and medical sciences\n\u2013 creating efficiencies in food production, detecting contaminants in\nmanufacturing, or developing novel cellular functions that act as new\ntherapies for chronic diseases and even synthetic organ transplantation.\n\nBuilding synthetic cells could also answer some of NASA\u2019s biggest questions\nabout the possibility of life beyond Earth.\n\n\u201cThe challenge of creating synthetic cells informs whether we\u2019re alone in the\nuniverse,\u201d said Rothschild. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to develop the skills to not just\ncreate synthetic analogs of life as it may have happened on Earth but to\nconsider pathways to life that could form on other planets.\u201d\n\nAs research continues on synthetic cell development, Rothschild sees\nopportunities where it could expand our understanding of the complexities of\nnatural life.\n\n\u201cLife is an amazing thing. We use the capabilities of cells all the time \u2013 we\nbuild houses with wood, we use leather in our shoes, we breathe oxygen. Life\nhas amazing precision, and if you can harness it, it\u2019s unbelievable what we\ncould accomplish.\u201d\n\nFor news media:\n\nMembers of the news media interested in covering this topic should reach out\nto the NASA Ames newsroom.\n\n## Share\n\n## Details\n\nLast Updated\n\nMay 02, 2024\n\n## Related Terms\n\n  * General\n  * Ames Research Center\n  * Cell and Molecular Biology\n  * Developmental, Reproductive and Evolutionary Biology\n  * Science & Research\n\n## Explore More\n\n2 min read\n\n### Hubble Hunts Visible Light Sources of X-Rays\n\nThis NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image features the dwarf galaxy IC 776.\nThis swirling collection...\n\nArticle 2 hours ago\n\n3 min read\n\n### NASA Research Park Public Documents\n\nArticle 16 hours ago\n\n5 min read\n\n### NASA Is Helping Protect Tigers, Jaguars, and Elephants.
