The \"teacher toad\" technique has proven so successful that researchers are looking to apply it to other species.\n\nResearchers have trained goannas not to eat cane toads in a bid to mitigate\nthe toxic pest's impact on native fauna.\n\nThe study, published in the Society for Conservation Biology's journal\nConservation Letters, found the technique had a significant impact on\nmaintaining population numbers.\n\nWorking alongside Bunuba Rangers and wildlife management agencies, researchers\nintroduced yellow-spotted monitors \u2013 a type of goanna \u2013 to small doses of the\ncane toad toxin, ahead of the \"cane toad frontline\" in Western Australia's\nKimberley region.\n\nA male yellow spotted monitor investigates the sardine tin bait in front of a\nremote camera in an area treated with 'teacher toads'.(Supplied: Georgia Ward-\nFear)\n\nLead researcher Georgia Ward-Fear said the goannas developed what was known as\n\"conditioned taste aversion\".\n\n\"We actually give goannas small doses of cane toad toxin that makes them sick\nbut doesn't kill them and then they can learn from that experience,\" she said.\n\nDr Ward-Fear said large, toxic adult cane toads tended to be at the forefront\nof the areas they were invading and that they killed any animal they\ninteracted with.\n\n\"What we do is we bring baby cane toads from behind the frontline to just\nahead of the frontline so that animals have a potential learning experience\nwith a small cane toad,\" she said.\n\n## Teacher toads\n\nThe idea of using \"teacher toads\" has already been tested on a smaller scale,\nbut this study demonstrated the method could be used at an ecosystem level.\n\nFor three years, researchers surveyed goanna populations at sites across the\nFitzroy Valley before and after the arrival of cane toads, which were first\nsighted in the area in March 2019.\n\nAs little as six per cent of the goanna population remained after the arrival\nof cane toads at control sites where the technique was not used.\n\nBut in areas where teacher toads were introduced at least 35 per cent of the\ngoanna population remained.\n\n\"The strategy has been so successful,\" Dr Ward-Fear said.\n\n\"We are applying it to other studies and other species with the hope of\nincreasing their survival and trying to decrease the impact of cane toads,\nbecause they're here to stay, unfortunately.\"\n\nDr Ward-Fear says cane toads cannot be eradicated, but they can be\ncontrolled.(ABC News)\n\n## Broad benefits\n\nTeacher toads have also proved successful with smaller marsupials and\nreptiles, but preserving apex predators such as goannas benefits the entire\necosystem.\n\nDr Ward-Fear said the absence of goannas would have a significant impact on\nother species.\n\n\"It is a very real possibility that the ecosystem will become unbalanced,\nbecause these animals sit at the top of the food web, keep the predators below\nthem in check to stop them breeding up in high numbers and eating the animals\nbelow them,\" she said.\n\n\"Ecosystems are such a delicate balance that once you take out a component, it\nhas really big impacts for the rest of the ecosystem.\n\n\"Not to mention that they're very important for Indigenous traditional owners\nall across northern Australia, because they're important totemic species and\nimportant bush tucker.\"\n\n## ABC Great Southern \u2014 local news in your inbox\n\nGet our local newsletter, delivered free each Thursday\n\nYour information is being handled in accordance with the ABC Privacy\nCollection Statement.\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of\nService apply.\n\nPosted 1h ago1 hours agoWed 17 Apr 2024 at 3:46am\n\nShare\n\n  * Copy\n  * Facebook\n  * X (formerly Twitter)\n\n## Related Stories\n\n  * ### 'Sneaky' cane toad spotted in Broome a year ahead of pest's forecast march across Western Australia\n\n  * ### What you can do in your own backyard to help minimise the spread of cane toads\n\n  * ### Air-dropped cane toad snags may not be the solution to extinctions Australia was hoping for\n\nMore on:\n\n  * Animals\n  * Broome\n  * Conservation\n  * Derby\n  * Fitzroy Crossing\n  * Pests\n\n## Top Stories\n\n  * ### Richard Marles unveils $50 billion defence spending increase over next decade\n\n  * ### Man wrongly identified as Bondi Junction stabber pursues defamation case against Network Seven\n\n  * ### At 17, Joel Cauchi was diagnosed with schizophrenia.
