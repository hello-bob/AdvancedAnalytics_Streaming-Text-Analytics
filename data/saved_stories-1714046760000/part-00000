The book is not intended to cover advanced\nmachine learning techniques because there are already plenty of books doing\nthis. Instead, we aim to provide the necessary mathematical skills to read\nthose other books.\n\nThe book is available at published by Cambridge University Press (published\nApril 2020).\n\nWe split the book into two parts:\n\n  * Mathematical foundations\n  * Example machine learning algorithms that use the mathematical foundations\n\nWe aimed to keep this book fairly short, so we don\u2019t cover everything.\n\nWe will keep PDFs of this book freely available.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\nPart I: Mathematical Foundations\n\n  1. Introduction and Motivation\n  2. Linear Algebra\n  3. Analytic Geometry\n  4. Matrix Decompositions\n  5. Vector Calculus\n  6. Probability and Distribution\n  7. Continuous Optimization\n\nPart II: Central Machine Learning Problems\n\n  8. When Models Meet Data\n  9. Linear Regression\n  10. Dimensionality Reduction with Principal Component Analysis\n  11. Density Estimation with Gaussian Mixture Models\n  12. Classification with Support Vector Machines\n\n### Report errata and feedback.\n\nAny issues you raise now may not make it into the printed version, but we will\nkeep an updated PDF around (and the errata).\n\n## Downloads\n\n### PDF of the book\n\nThis version is the most up-to-date version of the book, i.e., we continue\nfixing typos etc.\n\n### Instructor\u2019s manual containing solutions to the exercises (can be\nrequested from Cambridge University Press)\n\n### Errata on overleaf\n\n### PDF of the printed book\n\nThis version is equivalent (modulo formatting) with the printed version of the\nbook. GitHub issues starting from 433 are not included in this version.\n\n## Solutions to exercises\n\n  * Instructor\u2019s manual containing solutions to the exercises (can be requested from Cambridge University Press)\n  * Additional exercises (with solutions)\n\n## Tutorials\n\n  * Jupyter notebook tutorials (for learning)\n\n    1. Linear Regression\n    2. PCA\n    3. Gaussian Mixture Models\n    4. SVM (work in progress)\n  * Jupyter notebook tutorials (solutions)\n\n    1. Linear Regression\n    2. PCA\n    3. Gaussian Mixture Models\n    4. SVM (work in progress)\n  * NeurIPS-2020 tutorial on integration and differentiation\n\n## External resources\n\nOther people have created resources that support the material in this book.\n\n## Testimonies\n\n\u2018This book provides great coverage of all the basic mathematical concepts for\nmachine learning. I\u2019m looking forward to sharing it with students, colleagues,\nand anyone interested in building a solid understanding of the fundamentals.\u2019\nJoelle Pineau, McGill University and Facebook\n\n\u2018The field of machine learning has grown dramatically in recent years, with an\nincreasingly impressive spectrum of successful applications. This\ncomprehensive text covers the key mathematical concepts that underpin modern\nmachine learning, with a focus on linear algebra, calculus, and probability\ntheory. It will prove valuable both as a tutorial for newcomers to the field,\nand as a reference text for machine learning researchers and engineers.\u2019\nChristopher Bishop, Microsoft Research Cambridge\n\n\u2018This book provides a beautiful exposition of the mathematics underpinning\nmodern machine learning. Highly recommended for anyone wanting a one-stop shop\nto acquire a deep understanding of machine learning foundations.\u2019 Pieter\nAbbeel, University of California, Berkeley\n\n\u2018The book hits the right level of detail for me. Too many of the ML books have\na \u201cdon\u2019t worry your pretty head about this detail\u201d mentality, or go the other\nway and overwhelm me with detail. Your book is comprehensive and has a sense\nof ease and expanse, but it feels like I can get to the application part\nquickly enough.\u2019 Sriram Srinivasan\n\nHosted on GitHub Pages \u2014 Theme by orderedlist\n\n", "frontpage": false}
