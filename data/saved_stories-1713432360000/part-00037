This just\nconfirms their wariness of the DWP as the bit of government that is the least\nsympathetic, most faceless and most heartless.\u201d\n\nUnpaid carers are entitled to a carer\u2019s allowance of \u00a381.90 a week \u2013 the\nsmallest benefit of its kind \u2013 providing they care for someone for at least 35\nhours a week. They are allowed to work but must not make more than \u00a3151 a week\nafter tax and expenses.\n\nPeople who make more than the \u00a3151 weekly limit, even as little as 1p more,\nmust pay back the entire week\u2019s carer\u2019s allowance for the whole period in\nwhich they were in breach of the rules, in what has been described as a \u201ccliff\nedge\u201d approach.\n\nTens of thousands of carers have unwittingly fallen foul of this rule and have\nnot been alerted by the DWP until years later, even though the government has\nreal-time technology that means it can spot and stop these infractions much\nsooner.\n\nCarers have been plunged into debt, forced to sell their homes and given\ncriminal records over what they say were \u201chonest mistakes\u201d that should have\nbeen spotted much sooner by the DWP.\n\nThree former work and pensions secretaries, including Iain Duncan Smith, have\ncalled on the government to pause investigations into unpaid carers and launch\na review of its failings. Debbie Abrahams, a Labour MP on the Commons work and\npensions committee, has called the DWP\u2019s approach \u201csimply vindictive\u201d.\n\nJolyon Maugham, director of the Good Law Project, a campaign group supporting\nunpaid carers, said the DWP\u2019s attempt to dissuade people against appealing was\n\u201cquite troubling and quite unsavoury\u201d.\n\nMaugham said: \u201cParliament has set up an appellant system to enable appeals\nagainst demands that people repay carer\u2019s allowance. For the DWP to take steps\nto discourage people from using this very important safeguard is itself quite\ntroubling.\u201d\n\nEmily Holzhausen, director of policy at Carers UK, said unpaid carers feel\n\u201cstuck in a place where they feel unable to challenge decisions \u2013 even though\nthey have a legal right to do so\u201d.\n\nThe DWP said: \u201cCarers across the UK are unsung heroes who make a huge\ndifference to someone else\u2019s life and we have increased carer\u2019s allowance by\nalmost \u00a31,500 since 2010.\n\n\u201cWe have safeguards in place for managing repayments, that\u2019s why visiting\nofficers are available to provide support and assistance to customers when\nattending their homes, particularly for those deemed vulnerable.\n\n\u201cClaimants have a responsibility to inform DWP of any changes in their\ncircumstances that could impact their award, and it is right that we recover\ntaxpayers\u2019 money when this has not occurred.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Carers\n  * Social care\n  * Benefits\n  * Welfare\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Labour plans review of carer\u2019s allowance after thousands forced to repay\n\n1d ago\n\n  * ### Carers having to pay back thousands is very wrong, says Keir Starmer\n\n2d ago\n\n  * ### Fined \u00a36,000 for tiny mistake: carer penalised for extra shift at supermarket\n\n10 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Iain Duncan Smith urges ministers to pause carers\u2019 fines\n\n9 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Calls to end \u2018persecution\u2019 of carers over UK benefits rule breaches\n\n9 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### The Guardian view on carer\u2019s allowance: people who look after others should not be an afterthought\n\n8 Apr 2024\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncomments\n\n  * ### Carers in the UK: have you been threatened with prosecution for benefit fraud?\n\n8 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Why are so many carers being taken to court for benefit fraud?\n\n7 Apr 2024\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * UK\n  * UK politics\n  * Education\n  * Media\n  * Society\n  * Law\n  * Scotland\n  * Wales\n  * Northern Ireland\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
