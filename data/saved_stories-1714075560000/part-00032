The rules are a key part of President Joe\nBiden's pledge to eliminate carbon pollution from the electricity sector by\n2035 and economy-wide by 2050.\n\nThe rule was among four separate measures targeting coal and natural gas\nplants that the EPA said would provide \u201cregular certainty\u201d to the power\nindustry and encourage them to make investments to transition \u201cto a clean\nenergy economy.\u201d They also include requirements to reduce toxic wastewater\npollutants from coal-fired plants and to safely manage so-called coal ash in\nunlined storage ponds.\n\nThe new rules \u201creduce pollution from fossil fuel-fired power plants, protect\ncommunities from pollution and improve public health \u2014 all while supporting\nthe long-term, reliable supply of the electricity needed to power America\nforward,\u2032\u2032 EPA Administrator Michael Regan told reporters at a White House\nbriefing.\n\nThe plan is likely to be challenged by industry groups and Republican-leaning\nstates. They have repeatedly accused the Democratic administration of\noverreach on environmental regulations and have warned of a looming\nreliability crisis for the electric grid. The rules issued Thursday are among\nat least a half-dozen EPA rules limiting power plant emissions and wastewater\npollution.\n\nEnvironmental groups hailed EPA\u2019s latest action as urgently needed to protect\nagainst the devastating harms of climate change.\n\nThe power plant rule marks the first time the federal government has\nrestricted carbon dioxide emissions from existing coal-fired power plants. The\nrule also would force future electric plants fueled by coal or gas to control\nup to 90% of their carbon pollution. The new standards will avoid 1.38 billion\nmetric tons of carbon pollution through 2047, equivalent to the annual\nemissions of 328 million gas cars, the EPA said, and will provide hundreds of\nbillions of dollars in climate and health benefits, measured in fewer\npremature deaths, asthma cases and lost work or school days.\n\nCoal plants that plan to stay open beyond 2039 would have to cut or capture\n90% of their carbon dioxide emissions by 2032, the EPA said. Plants that\nexpect to retire by 2039 would face a less stringent standard but still would\nhave to capture some emissions. Coal plants that are set to retire by 2032\nwould not be subject to the new rules.\n\nRich Nolan, president and CEO of the National Mining Association, said that\nthrough the latest rules, \u201cthe EPA is systematically dismantling the\nreliability of the U.S. electric grid.''\n\nHe accused Biden, Regan and other officials of \u201cignoring our energy reality\nand forcing the closure of well-operating coal plants that repeatedly come to\nthe rescue during times of peak demand. The repercussions of this reckless\nplan will be felt across the country by all Americans.\u201d\n\nRegan denied that the rules were aimed at shutting down the coal sector, but\nacknowledged in proposing the power plant rule last year that, \u201cWe will see\nsome coal retirements.\u201d\n\nThe proposal relies on technologies to limit carbon pollution that the\nindustry itself has said are viable and available, Regan said. \u201cMultiple power\ncompanies have indicated that (carbon capture and storage) is a viable\ntechnology for the power sector today, and they are currently pursuing those\nCCS projects,'' he told reporters Wednesday.\n\nCoal provided about 16% of U.S. electricity last year, down from about 45% in\n2010. Natural gas provides about 43% of U.S. electricity, with the remainder\nfrom nuclear energy and renewables such as wind, solar and hydropower.\n\nThe power plant rule \u201ccompletes a historic grand slam\u201d of major actions by the\nBiden administration to reduce carbon pollution, said David Doniger, a climate\nand clean energy expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council. The first\nand most important action was passage of the 2022 climate law, officially\nknown as the Inflation Reduction Act, he said, followed by separate EPA rules\ntargeting tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks and methane emissions from\noil and gas drilling.\n\nTogether, the climate law and the suite of EPA rules \u201care the biggest\nreductions in carbon pollution we've ever made and will put the country on the\npathway to zero out carbon emissions,'' Doniger said in an interview.\n\nThe nation still faces challenges in eliminating carbon from transportation,\nheavy industry and more, said Abigail Dillen, president of the environmental\ngroup Earthjustice, \"but we can't make progress on any of it without cleaning\nup the power plants.''\n\nJim Matheson, CEO of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association,\ncalled the EPA rule \"unlawful, unrealistic and unachievable,\u201d adding that it\nfaced a certain court challenge. The rule disregards the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022\ndecision that limited the agency\u2019s ability to regulate carbon pollution under\nthe Clean Air Act, Matheson said. It also relies on technologies \u201cthat are\npromising, but not ready for prime time,\u2032\u2032 he said.\n\n\u201cThis barrage of new EPA rules ignores our nation\u2019s ongoing electric\nreliability challenges and is the wrong approach at a critical time for our\nnation\u2019s energy future,\u201d said Matheson, whose association represents 900 local\nelectric cooperatives across the country.\n\nThe EPA rule would not mandate use of equipment to capture and store carbon\nemissions \u2014 a technology that is expensive and still being developed. Instead,\nthe agency would set caps on carbon dioxide pollution that plant operators\nwould have to meet. Some natural gas plants could start blending gas with\nother fuel sources that do not emit carbon, although specific actions would be\nleft to industry.\n\nStill, the regulation is expected to lead to greater use of carbon capture\nequipment. Only a handful of projects are operating in the country despite\nyears of research.\n\nThe EPA also tightened rules aimed at reducing wastewater pollution from coal-\nfired power plants and preventing harm from toxic pits of coal ash, a waste\nbyproduct of burning coal.\n\nCoal ash contains cancer-causing substances like arsenic and mercury that can\nleach into the ground, drinking water and nearby rivers and streams, harming\npeople and killing fish. The waste is commonly stored in ponds near power\nplants. EPA issued rules in 2015 to regulate active and new ponds at operating\nfacilities, seven years after a disaster in Kingston, Tennessee that flooded\ntwo rivers with toxic waste and destroyed property.\n\nEnvironmental groups challenged that rule, arguing it left a large amount of\ncoal ash waste unregulated by the federal government. The rule issued Thursday\nforces owners to safely close inactive coal ash ponds and clean up\ncontamination.\n\nA separate rule will reduce toxic wastewater pollution by 660 million pounds\nannually, according to federal officials. It\u2019s a reversal of the Trump\nadministration\u2019s push to loosen coal plant wastewater standards.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, we have seen a comprehensive set of standards that\nprotects the surrounding waterways from the extremely nasty water pollution\nthat comes off these coal-fired sites,\u201d said Frank Holleman, attorney with the\nSouthern Environmental Law Center.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Michael Phillis in St. Louis contributed to this\nstory.\n\n## Top Stories\n\n### What witnesses said about Trump's handling of classified info while\npresident\n\n  * Apr 24, 8:58 PM\n\n### Plastic bags from Walmart US recycling tracked to facilities in Southeast\nAsia\n\n  * Apr 24, 1:48 AM\n\n### Airlines required to refund passengers for canceled, delayed flights\n\n  * Apr 24, 3:06 PM\n\n### Secret Service prepares for if Trump is jailed for contempt in hush money\ncase\n\n  * Apr 23, 8:16 PM\n\n### Comparing Donald Trump's hush money trial to John Edwards, Bill Clinton\ncases\n\n  * 3 hours ago\n\n### ABC News Live\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\n\nABC News Network\n\nAbout Nielsen Measurement\n\nChildren's Online Privacy Policy\n\nContact Us\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\n\nInterest-Based Ads\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTerms of Use\n\nYour US State Privacy Rights\n\n\u00a9 2024 ABC News\n\n", "frontpage": true}
