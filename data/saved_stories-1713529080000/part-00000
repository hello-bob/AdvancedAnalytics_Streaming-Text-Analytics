The strikes, confirmed by multiple U.S. officials, come as a\ndirect response to Iran's unprecedented assault on Israeli territory, marking\na new chapter in the covert conflict that has long simmered between the two\nregional adversaries.\n\nThe early morning offensive saw Israeli missiles raining down on the Iranian\ncities of Isfahan and Natanz, both known for their roles in Iran's nuclear\nprogram. The exact nature of the targets remains unconfirmed, but the\nsymbolism is unmistakable: Israel is willing to strike at the heart of Iran's\nnuclear ambitions.\n\nAs commercial flights rerouted in panic and the world held its breath, the\nstrategic underpinnings of the attack began to surface. Saudi Arabia, the\nquiet giant in the room, stands to gain significantly if Israel's strikes\nmanage to cripple Iran's nuclear capabilities. Riyadh's longstanding rivalry\nwith Tehran is no secret, and a weakened Iran would tilt the regional balance\nof power in favor of the Saudis.\n\nBut the plot thickens. Israeli and Saudi intelligence services, once covert\nenemies, now find themselves sharing information and coordinating operations\nagainst a common foe. This clandestine partnership, revealed through shared\nintelligence that helped thwart Iran's retaliatory drone and missile assault,\nunderscores a realpolitik alliance that would have been unthinkable a decade\nago.\n\nThe implications for the United States are profound. As the Biden\nadministration juggles its commitment to Israel's security with the desire to\navoid a full-scale regional war, the U.S. finds itself in a precarious\nposition. On one hand, American forces played a pivotal role in intercepting\nIran's barrage, showcasing the U.S.'s military prowess and its ironclad\nsupport for Israel. On the other, there's a delicate dance to maintain\nrelations with Arab states, who, while sharing intelligence, are wary of being\ndragged into the fray.\n\nThe Saudi gambit is a calculated one. By aiding Israel, albeit covertly,\nRiyadh sends a message of strength to Tehran while avoiding the international\nbacklash that would come with an overt strike. It's a win-win for the kingdom:\nthey bolster their defense against Iran and curry favor with the U.S., all\nwithout firing a shot in public.\n\nAs the dust settles on this latest confrontation, one thing is clear: the\nMiddle East's power dynamics are shifting. Israel's bold move, Saudi Arabia's\nshadowy support, and the U.S.'s strategic interests are converging in a high-\nstakes game that could reshape the region for years to come. The question now\nis not if there will be repercussions, but when and how Iran will choose to\nrespond and strike Israeli nuclear sites.\n\nsources\n\nReport: Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, provided intelligence on Iran attack | The Times of Israel\n\nhttps://www.timesofisrael.com/report-gulf-states-including-saudi-arabia-\nprovided-intelligence-on-iran-attack/\n\nIsrael Launches Attack On Iran; Explosions Heard In Areas With Nuclear Sites | The Daily Wire\n\nhttps://www.dailywire.com/news/israel-launches-attack-on-iran-explosions-\nheard-in-areas-with-nuclear-sites?topStoryPosition=1\n\nHow Israel could respond to Iran\u2019s drone and missile assault\n\nhttps://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20240418-how-israel-could-respond-to-\niran-s-drone-and-missile-assault\n\nIsrael\u2019s response to Iran and the factors that will shape it | News | Al Jazeera\n\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/4/18/israels-response-to-iran-and-the-\nfactors-shaping-it\n\nUAE, Saudi Arabia Privately Shared Intelligence With U.S. On Iranian Attack -\nReport - I24NEWS\n\nhttps://www.i24news.tv/en/news/middle-east/the-gulf/artc-uae-saudi-arabia-\nprivately-shared-intelligence-with-u-s-on-iranian-attack-report\n\nIsraeli attack on nuclear sites to prompt tit-for-tat, pursuing nukes: Iran | Israel War on Gaza News | Al Jazeera\n\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/4/18/iran-threatens-tit-for-tat-bomb-run-\nif-israel-attacks-nuclear-facilities\n\nMiscalculation Led to Escalation in Clash Between Israel and Iran - The New\nYork Times\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/17/world/middleeast/iran-israel-attack.html\n\nSaudi, UAE 'shared intel with US, Israel' before Iran attack\n\nhttps://www.newarab.com/news/saudi-uae-shared-intel-us-israel-iran-attack\n\nRiyadh confirms its role in the anti-Iran military coalition - The Jerusalem\nPost\n\nhttps://www.jpost.com/middle-east/saudi-arabia-acknowledges-helping-defend-\nisrael-against-iran-797201\n\nThe Latest | US vetoes UN resolution backing full Palestinian membership and puts sanctions on Iran | AP News\n\nhttps://apnews.com/article/israel-iran-hamas-\nlatest-04-18-2024-dc34b0c2986834549da9fabd64ef1f7c\n\nArab states helped to defend Israel from Iran.
