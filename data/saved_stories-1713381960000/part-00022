It's a base for scientists and\nastronauts from a number of different countries around the world.\n\nTogether they carry out experiments to learn more about living and working in\nspace.\n\nThe ISS was built in space, starting in 1998, with more and more modules -\ndifferent parts of the station - being added ever since.\n\nIt's been in orbit for over 20 years, and Nasa plans to retire (or 'deorbit')\nthe ISS after 2030.\n\n## What is the problem with space junk?\n\nMedia caption,\n\nWhy space junk is a problem for scientists? (from April 2021)\n\nWhile Nasa says the chance of falling space debris causing harm to humans on\nEarth is very small, there is a growing number of objects in Earth's low orbit\nwhich is presenting another problem for scientists.\n\nAccording to stats from Our World in Data, 2023 was the biggest year for\nlaunches, with a total of 2,664 objects sent into space.\n\nThe BBC's Sky at Night says that the ISS has had to reposition itself 30 times\nsince it began operation to avoid collisions with space junk - like old and\nbroken satellites - in the Earth's orbit.\n\nScientists are researching ways to tackle the problem., including big magnets\nor claws that can collect pieces of junk.\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * Space junk lights up California sky\n\n    * Published\n\n3 April\n\n  * Caught in 4k: Start-up wants to show Earth in ultra-HD\n\n    * Published\n\n21 March\n\n  * Astronauts recycle 98% of their pee... to drink it!\n\n    * Published\n\n27 June 2023\n\n## Watch Newsround\n\n  * Watch Newsround.
