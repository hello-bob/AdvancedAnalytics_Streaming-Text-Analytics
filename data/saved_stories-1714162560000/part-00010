In 2018 the US Congress passed SESTA / FOSTA\n18, which survived legal challenges 4 by free speech advocates like EFF. This\nmonth, the UK again published a draft of the Online Safety Bill 3 which\n\u201cproposes measures to end anonymous browsing by requiring some online service\nproviders to implement age-verification checks for users.\u201d The State of Utah\njust passed a bill with similar requirements 4, ostensibly forcing large\nonline social platforms to begin obtaining proof of age from all their users\nby 2024.\n\nmagarshak.com\n\n### Reporting people\u2019s activities to the government: crackdown on peer-to-\npeer... 23\n\nGreg Magarshak's blog\n\nMany of these regulators don\u2019t understand the implications of what\u2019s possible\n9 with technology. Their bills, though vague, can be interpreted so broadly as\nto end internet use as we know it. And while the initial concern may be for\nchildren, subsequent governments can use the snooping apparatus for all kinds\nof things, as we have already seen the NSA unlawfully do because it was easy\n13. This isn\u2019t restricted to authoritarian countries, but even liberal Western\ndemocracies 2 have engaged in covert and illegal surveillance for decades 2.\n\n## The War on End-To-End Encryption\n\nOften, regulators would like to subvert end-to-end encryption: the kind that\nencrypts conversations all the way between the end-users devices. In the US,\nthe EARN IT Act 4 sought to outright ban this kind of encryption, before an\neven worse LAED anti-encryption bill 9 was proposed. Trump\u2019s attorney general\nwas vocally in favor after Apple refused to unlock iPhones of a shooting\nsuspect 6. In Australia, an anti-encryption bill already passed in 2018 6, and\nits 2021 \u201cHacking Bill\u201d 7 can jeopardize privacy and security, with\nwarrantless surveillance. Dubai has banned 4 (ostensibly) end-to-end encrypted\nmessengers like WhatsApp and Skype, except the ones that their government\nsecretly has a backdoor to 41. Here is the situation around the world:\n\nimage1818\u00d71316 89.6 KB\n\nSource: https://www.gp-digital.org/world-map-of-encryption/ 89\n\n## Scanning at the Edge\n\nAdvocates of end-to-end encryption say it\u2019s essential and not subject to\ncompromises, but a lot of corporations providing the encrypted messengers have\nexperimented with scanning content on the users\u2019 client software, before it is\nencrypted and sent from the device. Apple experimented with scanning 3 for\nChild Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), but killed the project last year after an\noutcry. Corporations like Facebook want to read your end-to-end encrypted\nchats 13 to show you advertising.\n\nThese corporations are working together with governments, and advertisers,\nscanning your conversations whether you know it or not. Much of Big Tech is\nfueled by ads and have massive incentives to secretly vacuum up your data and\neven record you without your consent 13. There is even a name for it:\nSurveillance Capitalism 9.\n\nAs long as you rely on Big Tech to provide your software, you\u2019ll just have to\ntake their word for it that they don\u2019t have backdoor keys to your encrypted\nmessages, and that they\u2019re not scanning things on the client side. You can do\nbetter: with Qbix Platform 82, you don\u2019t have to trust! People can verify the\ncode does what you expect \u2013 or even run it yourself, hosting your own\ncommunities with open source software on your choice of computer.\n\n## Power to the People\n\nAs a company, we\u2019ve spent the last decade building decentralized open source\nplatforms by the people, for the people, which are are independent of Big\nGovernment and Big Tech. Empowering any community to choose where to host\ntheir social network, even without the internet, goes a long way. It allows\ncommunities to get stuff done locally, without permission or rent-seeking\nbehavior from the owners of the infrastructure:\n\nEmpowering People.
