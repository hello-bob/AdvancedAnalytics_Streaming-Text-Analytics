Telecommunications companies are either government\nowned or are heavily regulated, privately owned monopolies who comply with\nmost government requests for backdoors or user data. The idea that today, we\nstill need to give out our phone numbers as primary identifiers to be able to\nuse the leading messaging apps should be frowned upon and actively challenged.\nIt\u2019s necessary to advocate for private alternatives in messaging that do not\nrely on user IDs of any kind - and yes, it\u2019s possible.\n\nMessaging is still not where it needs to be. Privacy is confused with\nsecurity, when both are not synonymous, and there are major gaps in helping\nusers understand the fundamental differences.\n\nFor example, while WhatsApp messages are end-to-end encrypted, let\u2019s consider\nwhat you give up when you use it, per its own listings in app stores:\n\n  * App activity (app interactions, in-app search history, and other user-generated content)\n  * Location\n  * Financial information (user payment info and payment history)\n  * Contacts and their phone numbers\n  * Groups you\u2019re a member of\n  * When you use the app and how often you use it\n  * Device and other IDs\n  * Personal info (email address, user IDs, phone number)\n\nThis is called metadata. It reveals a wealth of information about you and your\nconnections, and in the hands of a centralized monopoly, this can and does get\nmisused in incredibly dangerous ways. Once such metadata is logged, it can\ncreate very detailed profiles about who you are, everywhere you\u2019ve been, and\neveryone you\u2019ve ever spoken to. In settling for apps that normalize this while\ngiving you the illusion of privacy in their marketing, we are doing ourselves\na disservice by accepting this as the default. Collectively, we aren\u2019t doing\nenough to protect ourselves and our social graph from this invasive overreach.\n\nWhen stored, aggregated and analyzed, this metadata provides ample information\nthat could potentially incriminate someone or be submitted to authorities.\nWhen WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger enabled end-to-end encryption for\nmessages, of course it was a welcome and widely celebrated change. But it\u2019s\nimportant to remember that not all end-to-end encryption utilizes the same\nstandards, some implementations are more secure than others, so it\u2019s something\nthat shouldn\u2019t necessarily be accepted at face value. More importantly:\ncollecting and storing an obscene amount of metadata should invite global\nscrutiny, considering this data is often combined with whatever other\ninformation companies like Meta harvest about your identity (which is a lot.)\n\nThis is one of the many reasons why we need to resist giving out our phone\nnumbers just to access an app, especially to do something as personal and\nintimate as private messaging. Even though users can sometimes mask their\nnumbers with a username, their identity on the app is still fundamentally tied\nto their phone number. App operators have access to this, as well as user\ncontacts. Additionally, with a simple modification to the app's source code,\nthe contacts may also gain access in some cases. This should raise more\nconcerns about privacy, and it makes the need for anonymity difficult to\nachieve.\n\nEveryone has a different threat model (and if you don\u2019t yet, now is a good\ntime to create one). For many users today, WhatsApp and other apps may be\nsufficient for their specific needs, especially in connecting with families\nand friends who are already on the app and unlikely to migrate elsewhere. If\nthat suits your life and needs, and if you\u2019re aware and consciously accept the\nrisks, great.\n\nBut we also need to acknowledge that the world is becoming increasingly\ndangerous in the way AI is being used to supercharge surveillance, and we need\nto be educated and aware of the risks this is already having on our lives and\nwhat it subjects others in your network to when you choose metadata-heavy apps\nas your primary form of communication. Having alternatives will always be\nimportant, even if it\u2019s not what you default to for everyday messaging.\nRecognize who in your social circles might require the extra privacy,\nanonymity and security, so that you can play a role in protecting vulnerable\nindividuals who need it most. The messaging app you choose implicates others\nas well, not just yourself, and while you personally may not require complete\nprivacy, others might have their lives depend on it.\n\nEnd-to-end encryption is a solid start, but it's just the beginning of our\npursuit for true privacy and security. True privacy means that even when legal\ndemands come knocking, there's no useful metadata to hand over. It's not\nenough to just protect the content of messages; we need consistent innovation\nin protecting metadata too.\n\nChanging ingrained habits is tough, but your privacy is always worth the\nfight. Although giants like WhatsApp and Telegram may dominate global\nmessaging for now, increasing concerns about data harvesting and AI-driven\nsurveillance are fueling demand for alternatives. SimpleX Chat aims to be one\nof those strong alternatives, hence its radical focus on a decentralized\nframework with no user identifiers (in other words, nothing that uniquely\nidentifies users on the protocol level to their contacts or to the relays) and\nextra optionality (self-hosting an SMP server or XFTP server, access via Tor,\nchat profiles with incognito mode, etc.)\n\nAs of today, most messaging alternatives, including SimpleX, will have some\nlimitations. But with the limited resources we have, we are committed to daily\nprogress towards creating a truly private messenger that anyone can use while\nmaintaining the features that users have come to know and love in messaging\ninterfaces. We want to be the prime example of a messenger that achieves\ngenuine privacy without compromising it for convenience. We need to be able to\nreliably move away from small and niche use cases to endorsing and enforcing\nglobal standards for privacy and making it accessible for all users regardless\nof their technical expertise.\n\nWe\u2019re grateful for the users and donors who have been following along on this\njourney thus far and helping with feedback, anything from bug reports to\nidentifying potential risks. Building in the open has always been a necessity\nfor transparency and ongoing auditability, because we don\u2019t want anyone to\njust take our word for it. See for yourself and engage in the discussions. We\nfully expect you to hold us accountable to our word.\n\nSimpleX Whitepaper SimpleX Chat protocol Terms & Privacy Policy Donate\n\nTerminal CLI TypeScript SDK\n\n\u00a9 2020-2023 SimpleX | Open-Source Project\n\n", "frontpage": false}
