Ti_3SiC_2 is a renown MAX phase,\nwhere M is a transition metal, A is a group A element, and X is C or N. Our\ndeveloped synthetic route is by a facile, scalable and hydrofluoric acid-free\nmethod. The two-dimensional layers are termed goldene. Goldene layers with\nroughly 9% lattice contraction compared to bulk gold are observed by electron\nmicroscopy. While ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that two-\ndimensional goldene is inherently stable, experiments show some curling and\nagglomeration, which can be mitigated by surfactants. X-ray photoelectron\nspectroscopy reveals an Au 4f binding energy increase of 0.88 eV. Prospects\nfor preparing goldene from other non-van der Waals Au-intercalated phases,\nincluding developing etching schemes, are presented.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Self-assembly of N-heterocyclic carbenes on Au(111)\n\nArticle Open access 29 June 2021\n\nAlex Inayeh, Ryan R.

Jun Li\n\n## Main\n\nThe discovery of graphene created great interest in two-dimensional (2D)\nmaterials^1, but it is tricky to synthesize 2D materials comprised solely of\nmetals. Gold nanoparticles are of interest due to their application in\nelectronics, catalysis, photonics, sensing and biomedicine^2. Recent advances\nhave demonstrated that gold nanoparticle catalysts can turn plastic waste and\nbiomass into value-added chemicals^3, and photocatalytically drive overall\nwater splitting and hydrogen peroxide production^4. Anisotropic gold\nstructures are a growing area of research with various low-symmetry allotrope\nstructures that show unique properties compared to their bulk counterparts^5.\nPlasmonic properties of gold nanoparticles vary depending on geometrical\nproperties. Cluster Au_5\u201313^\u2212 anions^6 form planar molecules due to strong\nrelativistic effects^7 that stabilize the outer 6s shell and destabilize the\n5d shell. The planarity is attributed to the unique hybridization of the half-\nfilled 6s orbital with the fully occupied \\\\(5{{d}}_{{{z}}^{2}}\\\\)\norbital^8,9. Atomically thin 2D Au sheets are therefore expected to offer\nunusual plasmonic and electronic properties and to be potentially beneficial\nto photonic and medical applications such as solar energy harvesting and\nplasmonic photothermal therapies for cancer treatment^10,11. Furthermore, the\nhigh surface-area-to-volume ratio and abundance of unsaturated atoms exposed\non the surface, originating from its atomically thin 2D nature, would also\ncontribute to enhanced catalytic properties and enrich design variation for\nvarious applications^12. Additionally, the overall use of Au resources would\nbe minimized due to the increase in surface-area-to-volume ratio for atomic\nsheets.\n\nInspired by the experimental realization of free-standing monolayer iron\nsuspended in graphene pores, theoretical studies based on density-functional\ntheory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) predicted stable 2D Au\nmembranes with or without confinement by graphene pores^13,14,15,16,17,\nspecifically, stable Au membranes suspended in graphene pores with diameters\nup to 20 nm. Notably, the DFT structural optimization indicated that the\nfavoured 2D crystal would be of densely packed hexagonal structure that\ncorresponds to the bulk monolayer of Au(111) face-centred cubic (fcc) lattice.\n\nEpitaxial growth of single-crystal metal films has been demonstrated by\nnumerous types of vapour deposition on lattice-matched substrates^18. However,\nduring deposition gold forms islands due to a strong thermodynamic tendency\nfor coalescence. At best, this results in nanometre-thick continuous Au\nlayers^19. Unique synthetic routes of atomically thin gold sheets have been\ndeveloped. For example, Wang et al. reported the synthesis of (001)-oriented\ngold nanosheets with a thickness of 0.2\u20130.4 nm, corresponding to 1\u20132-atom-\nthick layers diffused into a layered double-hydroxide template^20. An attempt\nwas made to isolate the gold sheets, but removal of the hydroxide matrix\ntransformed the 2D Au structures into nanoparticles. Wang et al. fabricated\nsingle-atom-thick Au framed in bulk Au\u2013Ag alloy by electron beam\nirradiation^21. Similarly, Zhao et al. observed single-atom-thick Au\nnanoribbons suspended in graphene^22. Bhandari et al. prepared single-atom-\nthick gold quantum dots stabilized on hexagonal boron nitride surfaces^23 that\nshowed tuneable bandgaps, from 2.8 to 0.95 eV, depending on their size and\nshape, consistent with the DFT prediction. Forti et al. synthesized single-\natom-thick Au layers, stabilized between SiC(0001) and a buffer zero-layer\ngraphene via intercalation at elevated temperature^24. Although both the large\n2D and 3D clusters are expected to show more metallic properties as their size\nincreases^25 and infinite free-standing Au is predicted to be metallic^15, the\nintercalated Au monolayer showed semiconducting properties with the valence\nband maximum 50 meV below the Fermi level. Recently, Sharma et al. claimed to\nhave realized goldene by thermal dewetting of thin Au films on sapphire\nsubstrates, albeit with likely multilayers from the appearance of high-\nresolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM) images and\nsignatures from Au islands^26. The state-of-the-art of the thinnest free-\nstanding \u20182D\u2019 gold, without physical confinements, is two-atom-thick gold\nnanosheets that are fabricated via a wet-chemical route using methyl orange,\nwhich suppresses the nanosheet thickness^12. Yet, free-standing single-atom-\nthick 2D Au structures at the large scale have remained unrealized.\n\nHere, we present a synthetic route to exfoliate goldene from Ti_3AuC_2, a\nnanolaminated MAX phase, where M is a transition metal, A is a group A\nelement, and X is C or N, initially formed by substituting Si in Ti_3SiC_2\nwith Au (ref. ^27), by wet-chemically etching away the carbide slabs using\nMurakami\u2019s reagent with cetrimonium bromide (CTAB) or cysteine. The developed\nmethod is facile, scalable and hydrofluoric acid-free. Goldene layers with\nroughly 9% lattice contraction compared to bulk gold are observed by electron\nmicroscopy. Despite an intrinsic 2D stability of goldene demonstrated by AIMD\nsimulations, experiments show some curling and agglomeration, which can be\nmitigated by surfactants to stabilize goldene exfoliated from Au-intercalated\nMAX phases. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveals Au 4f peak shifts\nto higher binding energy (E_b) by 0.88 eV.\n\n## Results and discussion\n\n### Preparation of goldene\n\nFigure 1a\u2013c shows cross-sectional HR-STEM images at 300 keV of exfoliated\nsingle-atom-thick 2D Au membranes, namely goldene, realized in this study\n(Supplementary Section 1). The 2D Au was achieved by etching away Ti_3C_2\nslabs from nanolaminated Ti_3AuC_2 MAX-phase films by using alkaline potassium\nferricyanide solution (Murakami\u2019s reagent) together with CTAB and cysteine as\nstabilizers (Fig. 1d). Etching without surfactants resulted in the formation\nof Au multilayers and clusters (Supplementary Section 2). M_n+1AX_n phases (n\n= 1, 2, 3 or 4) are a set of intrinsically laminated ternary materials^28. M\nis a transition metal, A is an element of groups 13\u201316 and X is carbon or\nnitrogen. MXene 2D ceramics are produced by etching away A layers from MAX\nphases, leaving M_n+1X_n layers: most A elements are weakly bonded to the\nneighbouring M elements, while the M\u2013X bonds are relatively strong^29,30.\nHydrofluoric acid is, for instance, used to selectively remove A elements from\nmost MAX phases. Here, we invert this concept by using Murakami\u2019s reagent to\netch away MX layers and leave free-standing single-atom-thick A layers. With\nlength scale normalization from well-defined Ti_3AuC_2 lattice parameter\nvalues, we obtain Au\u2013Au spacing of 2.62 \u00c5 in goldene (Supplementary Section\n1), close to a calculated Au\u2013Au bond length of 2.735 \u00c5 for an optimized\nclosely packed 2D Au (Supplementary Section 3), which is roughly 9% smaller\nthan the equilibrium interatomic distance in fcc gold (2.884 \u00c5). Au\u2013Au spacing\nvalues reported for subnanometre 2D Au are shorter than the typical\nequilibrium value found for high density and closely packed crystal structures\n(Supplementary Section 4) because the reduced 3D \u2192 2D dimensionality\nstrengthens in-plane bonding.\n\nFig. 1: Preparation of single-atom-thick gold: goldene.\n\na, Schematic atomic positions corresponding to a square in b, and HR-STEM\nimage of Ti_3AuC_2 along with [\\\\(11\\bar{2}0\\\\)] orientation marked in b.\nYellow, blue and black balls represent Au, Ti and C atoms, respectively.

Scale bar, 2 nm. d, Schematic illustration of\nthe preparation of goldene.\n\nFull size image\n\nTo elucidate the 2D morphology of goldene, we acquired plan-view HR-STEM\nimages at 60 keV of goldene sheets obtained by etching Ti_3AuC_2 using 0.2%\nMurakami\u2019s reagent with CTAB for 168 h (Fig. 2). The size of the goldene\nsheets varies from several nanometres to 100 nm. The goldene sheets are either\nfree-floating or stack on each other, and get entangled without causing the\ncoalescence that would result in the formation of gold nanoparticles (Fig.\n2a). This consolidates the efficacy of surfactants, which contribute to the\nstabilization of the goldene. Ordered patterns with 1.8\u20131.9 nm spans appear on\ngoldene that subsides onto unetched residual Ti_3AuC_2 or SiC substrate (Fig.\n2b,c). This is attributed to rippling of goldene, common to atomically thin\nmaterials^31 and comparable to ordered arrays of CTAB micelles on Au\nnanoparticles^32 in combination with rippling caused by the TEM sample\npreparation, as evaporating water causes the CTAB layer in between to shrink.\nThe possibility of the 1.8\u20131.9 nm spacing in Fig. 2b being moir\u00e9 effects\nbetween goldene sheets of different orientations or goldene on Ti_3AuC_2 or\nSiC could be refuted (Supplementary Section 5). Figure 2c shows STEM energy-\ndispersive X-ray spectroscopy mapping of goldene sheets, demonstrating that\nthe constituent element of the sheets is Au. Ti_3C_2 MXene and Ti oxide\nresiduals can also be seen due to the oxidizing etchant.\n\nFig. 2: Plan-view images of goldene.\n\na, HR-STEM image of goldene sheets that pile up on each other and get\nentangled.

Goldene sheets\nare produced using 0.2 and 0.5% Murakami\u2019s reagent for 168 h. Figure 3 shows\nthe corresponding Au 4f, Ti 2p and C 1s core-level XPS spectra. The Au 4f_7/2\npeak from the reference Au film is located at 83.96 eV, in agreement with the\nreference value^33. The full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the Au 4f_7/2\npeak is 0.62 eV. The Au 4f emission for pristine Ti_3AuC_2 (before etching)\nshows two Au 4f doublets. The dominant doublet peaks assigned to Au atoms in\nthe MAX phase are shifted towards a higher E_b by 0.92 eV with respect to the\nlower E_b pair that appears at the same E_b as the reference Au. The latter\ndoublet is due to the partially remaining capping Au layer on the top of\nTi_3AuC_2 after chemical\u2013mechanical polishing (CMP). The E_b shift of the Au\n4f peaks from Ti_3AuC_2 is attributed to the electronic charge transfer from\nAu to the Ti_3C_2 slabs. Such an E_b shift due to charge transfer has\npreviously been observed between Ti, Al and C atoms in Ti_3AlC_2 and Ti_2AlC\nMAX phases, for which the charge redistribution was of the same extent and\ndirection as between Ti atoms and Al atoms in TiAl alloy^34,35,36. The E_b of\nthe Au 4f_2/7 XPS peaks from a Ti\u2013Au alloy was reported to be 85 eV (ref.\n^35), similar to Ti_3AuC_2 in this work (Fig. 3), which further strengthens\nour interpretation that the high E_b doublet results from the negative charge\ntransfer from the Au atoms to the Ti_3C_2 slabs.\n\nFig. 3: X-ray photoelectron spectra for the reference Au, Ti_3AuC_2 and\ngoldene.\n\nComparison of the Ti 2p (left), C 1s (middle) and Au 4f (right) core-level\nspectra of the reference sputter-cleaned Au foil as well as on Ti_3AuC_2\nbefore and after etching by 0.2 and 0.5% Murakami\u2019s reagent with CTAB: the\nreference sputter-cleaned Au foil (yellow), pristine Ti_3AuC_2 (grey), goldene\nproduced by etching Ti_3AuC_2 with 0.5% Murakami\u2019s reagent for 168 h (blue)\nand goldene produced by etching Ti_3AuC_2 with 0.2% Murakami\u2019s reagent for 168\nh (red). For Ti_3AuC_2 before and after etching by 0.2 and 0.5% Murakami\u2019s\nreagent with CTAB in the Au 4f spectra (right), hollow dots and solid lines\nrepresent experimental data and the sum of fitted peaks: Ti\u2013Au in Ti_3AuC_2\n(grey), Au\u2013Au in the remaining Au capping or Au particles (yellow) and Au\u2013Au\nin goldene (green).\n\nSource data\n\nFull size image\n\nA possible contribution to the observed Au 4f shift is the final state effect:\nthe lower coordination number of Au atoms in the MAX phase than in the\nmetallic fcc Au has a negative effect on the screening of the core-hole state\nleft after the photoemission process^37,38. Therefore, the kinetic energy of\nthe electron escaping from the Au atoms in the MAX phase is reduced in\ncomparison to that excited from metallic Au due to a stronger Coulomb\ninteraction with the positively charged Au ion. The Au 4f peaks from Ti_3AuC_2\nare also broader (FWHM = 1.10 eV versus 0.62 eV for bulk Au) due to shorter\ncore-hole lifetimes.\n\nThe Au 4f spectrum from goldene produced from Ti_3AuC_2 after etching by 0.2\nand 0.5% Murakami\u2019s reagent shows two doublets. The more intense pair of peaks\nat the lower E_b originate from residuals of the capping Au layer. The less\nintense doublet peaks assigned to 2D gold bonding in goldene are shifted\ntowards a higher E_b by 0.88 eV with respect to the more intense lower E_b\npair corresponding to the bulk Au. It is pertinent that the higher E_b Au 4f\npeaks originate from goldene and not from Ti_3AuC_2, as the MAX phase totally\ndecomposes after etching. The latter is confirmed by the absence of carbidic\npeaks in the C 1s and Ti 2p spectra (Fig. 3). Despite the almost identical E_b\nposition of Au 4f for goldene and Ti_3AuC_2, the contributions to the shift\nare different for goldene and Ti_3AuC_2.\n\nUnlike the case of Ti_3AuC_2 with both the charge transfer between Au and Ti\nand final state effects, the shift for goldene mainly originates from the\nfinal state effects in agreement with our DFT-simulated core-level shifts\n(Supplementary Section 6). While the coordination number of bulk fcc Au is 12,\nAu in Ti_3AuC_2 forms six bonds with the surrounding Ti atoms and potentially\nsix weaker lateral bonds with the surrounding Au atoms. Meanwhile, Au in\ngoldene has only six or fewer lateral bonds with other Au with the shorter\nAu\u2013Au distance than in the case of the bulk Au and Ti_3AuC_2. Thus, the\nenhanced final state effect in goldene results in the Au 4f shift of the same\nmagnitude as that observed for Ti_3AuC_2. The 0.88 eV shift to higher E_b\nobserved for goldene is smaller than shifts reported for oxidized Au species.\nFor example, Au 4f shift with respect to Au^0 ranges between 1.0 and 2.69 eV\nfor Au^1\u20133+ (AuO, Au_2O and Au_2O_3); also, the shift reported for Au(OH)_3 is\n2.1 eV (refs. ^39,40,41,42). Therefore, it is unlikely that the observed Au 4f\npeak shifts in the spectrum from goldene are due to Au oxidation.\n\n### AIMD for goldene\n\nNext, we confirm the structural and dynamic stability of goldene, a monolayer\nof fcc Au(111), using AIMD (Supplementary Section 3). The dynamics of 2D\ndefect-free goldene is followed for 5 ps at 300 K. The AIMD simulations attest\nthe dynamic stability of the stoichiometric planar motif of goldene in the\nhexagonal triangular structure, consistent with previous ab initio\ncalculations and simulations (Fig. 4)^15. However, goldene layers produced by\netching show curling up and blob formation near its etched-free edges (Fig. 1\nand Supplementary Section 1). Thus, we further investigated the dynamic\nstability of goldene considering various structures and effects of point\ndefects: (1) infinite goldene with Au adatoms, (2) unstrained and initially\nstrained (tension and compression) goldene nanosheets with differently\noriented edges, (3) goldene nanosheets with Au vacancies and Si impurities and\n(4) goldene bilayers (with and without defects) with various interlayer\ndistances (Supplementary Sections 3.2\u20133.6). The simulations indicate stability\nand planarity of goldene nanosheets cut along and \u2039112\u203a edges, for which the\ncalculated out-of-plane vibrational amplitudes are similar to that of an\ninfinite defect-free goldene. On the other hand, the simulations suggest that\nSi impurities would distort the bond network to generate ripples in the layer\nif located near the edges of goldene. Conversely, Au vacancies have an\nindirect stabilization effect by acting as trapping sites for Si impurities.\nSmall rippling is observed in the AIMD simulations for an isolated goldene\nmonolayer, in agreement with the experimental observation here. However, the\namplitude of the ripples increases as the interlayer distance becomes smaller,\nwhich is a manifestation of mutual attraction between Au layers. Geim and\ncollaborators recently discovered that nano-rippling is typical in graphene\ndue to thermal fluctuations and local mechanical strain^31. Essentially, such\nrippling is inherent to atomically thin free-standing 2D materials and could\nbe beneficial to chemical reactions. Accordingly, the rippling nature of 2D Au\nlayers observed in our STEM analysis substantiates that they are free-\nstanding. Thus, goldene is intrinsically stable regardless of its lineaments,\nand the curling and blob formation observed in our experiments could be\nattributed to external factors related to initial Au interaction into\nTi_3SiC_2 to produce Ti_3AuC_2 and subsequent etching processes, such as\nelectron radiation damage during 300 kV STEM imaging.\n\nFig. 4: Plan and side orthographic views of a defect-free goldene monolayer.\n\nSupercell model used in AIMD simulations at 300 K. The crystallographic axes\nare relative to an Au(111) monolayer. The length of visible Au\u2013Au bonds is\n\u22643.6 \u00c5.\n\nFull size image\n\n### Mechanistic consideration on exfoliation of goldene\n\nWe experimentally realized various forms of 2D Au layers by using different\netching conditions (Supplementary Section 7). The alkaline solution of\npotassium ferricyanide consisting of 1 g of KOH, 1 g of K_3[Fe(CN)_6] and 10\nml of H_2O is conventionally called Murakami\u2019s reagent, and this concentration\nis referred to as 100%. Using this concentration resulted in complete\ndecomposition of Ti_3AuC_2 into amorphous TiC and spherical Au nanoparticles;\nhowever, a 2D Au monolayer at the interface of 4H\u2013SiC and Ti_3AuC_2 survived\nthe aggressive etching. Besides the etchant concentration, surfactants are\nessential to mitigate the coalescence of goldene layers and blob formation\nmediated by Au adatoms or Si impurities, as predicted by the AIMD simulation\n(Supplementary Section 3). Combining the lower concentration of 1\u20133%\nMurakami\u2019s reagent with the usage of CTAB and cysteamine as surfactants, free-\nstanding rippling membranes of two- and three-atom-thick 2D Au were fabricated\nfrom Ti_3Au_nC_2 (n = 2 and 3); here, blob formation at the edges of these\nexfoliated membranes was observed (Supplementary Section 7). The exfoliated 2D\nsingle-atom-thick Au, goldene (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Section 1), was\nachieved by using further lowered etchant concentrations of 0.2 and 1%\nMurakami\u2019s reagent together with CTAB and cysteine. CTAB is a long molecule\nwith a length of up to 20 \u00c5; meanwhile, the distance between Au layers within\nTi_3Au_nC_2 is 9.28 \u00c5. Thus, CTAB can infiltrate the Au layers exposed after\netching, only in parallel to Au layers, and would block the pathway for other\nCTAB to enter deeper. Cysteine and cysteamine have respective lengths below\n9.28 \u00c5, smaller than CTAB, and would more easily diffuse in between Au layers,\nalthough they would eventually block the pathways. Therefore, exfoliated 2D Au\nfirst appears at edges near the etching frontline.\n\nA mild etching is crucial for goldene derivatives from Ti_3Au_nC_2 compounds:\nthe lower the concentration is, the better the yield and quality of resulting\nAu layers are. This trend, however, ends with concentrations of around 0.2 and\n0.5% Murakami\u2019s reagent. The 0.1% concentration resulted in complete\ndecomposition of 2D Au layers into 3D spherical nanoparticles, due to the\nlower concentration needing a much longer etching duration. The etchants would\ngradually attack the freed Au layers initially stabilized by surfactants as\nthe radical nascent oxygen produced from the etchants eventually attacks the\nsurfactants. Therefore, considering the balance of mildness and duration of\netching, a concentration between 0.2 and 1% would be optimal for the Au layers\nto survive. The 0.2% Murakami\u2019s reagent with CTAB allowed exfoliated 2D Au to\npersist, but the blob formation at the edge of the 2D Au progresses\nsimultaneously. Further etching would advance the blob formation at the edges,\nand Au atoms of the blob diffuse laterally through the layer. Therefore, we\nobserved gold layers becoming thicker after etching for long duration\n(Supplementary Section 7). A previous report demonstrated the free-standing\ntwo-atom-thick Au membranes where the main structure is fcc, but hexagonal\nclose-packed reconstruction was observed at the edges^12. This non-fcc feature\nhas been found to stabilize planar Au structures^43. Appropriate selection of\netchant concentrations and smaller, more suitable surfactants would trigger\nsuch reconstruction of the exfoliated 2D Au edges and enable a higher yield of\ngoldene.\n\nBesides etchant concentrations and surfactants, a decisive factor for\npreparing goldene from a series of non-van der Waals Au-intercalated MAX\nphases is the interlayer distance between Au layers within the MAX lattice.\nOur AIMD simulations demonstrate that free-standing 2D Au layers coalesce in\nthe presence of Si impurities or if brought to within 7 \u00c5 distance of each\nother. However, if the separation distance increases to 10, 12 and 14 \u00c5, the\ngoldene\u2013goldene interlayer interaction decreases notably (Supplementary\nSection 3.1). The distance between Au layers within Ti_3AuC_2 is 9.28 \u00c5. Thus,\ninstant interlayer interaction is expected without surfactants as soon as\ngoldene layers are isolated from Ti_3AuC_2 during etching. Here, we produced\nthe Au-intercalated 413 MAX phases of Ti_4AuC_3 from Ti_4SiC_3 (Supplementary\nSection 8). The distance between Au layers within Ti_4AuC_3 is about 12 \u00c5.\nTherefore, a delay in goldene interactions after etching is expected, offering\na prolonged grace period for surfactants to stabilize the goldene sheets\nagainst coalescence and thus a greater likelihood of preservation.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nGoldene in the form of Au monolayer sheets is prepared by etching away Ti_3C_2\nslabs from Ti_3AuC_2. The precise dilution of Murakami\u2019s reagent as an etchant\nand the appropriate use of passivating surfactants such as CTAB and cysteine\nare essential. Our developed processing scheme has potential for expansion of\nthe goldene sheet area by means of etching and surfactant optimization. The\ntemplate SiC(0001) wafer size that sets the area limit of growing epitaxial\nTi_3SiC_2 for subsequent Au intercalation is currently 200 mm (refs. ^44,45),\nwhich would give an ample allowance for practical goldene application. The\nproduced goldene has a strongly contracted in-plane (111) lattice spacing by\nroughly 9% and Au 4f binding energy increase by around 0.88 eV, compared to\nbulk Au.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Ti_3AuC_2 films preparation\n\nTi_3SiC_2 films with a thickness of 60 nm were initially grown on 4H\u2013SiC\nsubstrate via a single-step synthesis process^44. The prepared Ti_3SiC_2 films\nwere transferred into another deposition chamber after being etched in\nbuffered hydrofluoric acid (NH_3F (25 g) + H_2O (50 ml) + 48% hydrofluoric\nacid (10 ml)) for 5 s to remove residual oxides on the surface that may hinder\nthe next step of Au interdiffusion. The films were covered with Au to a\nthickness of 200 nm using magnetron sputter deposition at room temperature.\nThe Au-covered films were transferred into a quartz tube inserted in a tube\nfurnace for annealing at 670 \u00b0C for 12 h. The furnace was heated up at a\nramping rate of 18 \u00b0C min^\u22121. To avoid oxidation of the samples, nitrogen gas\nwas flowed through the quartz tube during annealing. At the elevated\ntemperature, an exchange reaction of Au on top with Si within the Ti_3SiC_2\nfilms takes place, forming Ti_3AuC_2, without destroying the original layered\nstructure. The details of film preparation can be found elsewhere^27.\n\n### Exfoliation of goldene\n\nBefore etching off Ti_3C_2 slabs, the residual bulk Au with a thickness of up\nto 200 nm on the top of Ti_3Au_nC_2 was removed by CMP. CMP slurry was\nprepared by mixing fumed silica (2 g, Sigma-Aldrich), I_2 (1.2 g, Sigma-\nAldrich), KI (12 g, Sigma-Aldrich), citric acid (16 g, Sigma-Aldrich) and\ntrisodium citrate (3.7 g, Sigma-Aldrich) in 200 ml of deionized water; here,\nthe concentration of chemicals was optimized, substantially increased compared\nto the original recipe to effectively etch the thick Au reservoir^46. The\nmixture was subsequently sonicated for 1 h. The CMP was performed with a\npolishing system, Struers Tegramin-30, while the resulting CMP slurry was\ndripped onto a polishing cloth (Struers MD Chem; Supplementary Section 9 shows\nthe detailed CMP process). Goldene was produced by etching the exposed\nTi_3AuC_2 films with 0.2\u20131.0% Murakami\u2019s reagent with surfactants of CTAB or\nl-cysteine for 168 h (1 week), 1 month and 2 months (Supplementary Section\n10).\n\nThe etching effect produced by the Murakami\u2019s reagent originates from radical\nnascent oxygen [O] generated in the reaction occurring between potassium\nferricyanide and alkali in close conjunction with metal carbides surface that\nhas an attraction to oxygen^47. When the surface is attacked by potassium\nferricyanide K_3[Fe(CN)_6] and KOH, the Ti_3C_2 slabs withdraw the nascent\noxygen from KOH on the slab surface, and the potassium left combines with\npotassium ferricyanide K_3[Fe(CN)_6] to form potassium ferrocyanide\nK_4[Fe(CN)_6] (ref. ^47), according to the reaction:\n\n$$4{\\text{K}}_{3}[\\text{Fe}{(\\text{CN})}_{6}]+4\\text{KOH}\\to\n{4\\text{K}}_{4}[\\text{Fe}({\\text{CN})}_{6}]+2{{\\rm{H}}}_{2}\\text{O}+2[\\text{O}]$$\n\nSubsequently, the Ti_3C_2 slabs are subject to the oxidative nascent oxygen as\nfollows:\n\n$$2{\\text{Ti}}_{3}{\\text{C}}_{2}+11[\\text{O}]\\to\n{3\\text{Ti}}_{2}\\text{O}+4{\\text{CO}}_{2}$$\n\n$$2{\\text{Ti}}_{3}{\\text{C}}_{2}+7[\\text{O}]\\to\n{3\\text{Ti}}_{2}\\text{O}+4\\text{CO}$$\n\n$$2{\\text{Ti}}_{3}{\\text{C}}_{2}+3[\\text{O}]\\to\n{3\\text{Ti}}_{2}\\text{O}+4\\text{C}$$\n\nHere, ionization tendency and susceptibility to oxidation of Ti and C are\nconsiderably higher than those of Au. Thus, Ti and C are selectively oxidized\nby the nascent oxygen.\n\nAu is inert to both potassium ferricyanide and its by-product of potassium\nferrocyanide under the darkness; on the other hand, the light-triggered\ndissolution of Au by potassium ferrocyanide was observed^48. Even ambient\nlight could dissolve Au in the presence of potassium ferrocyanide. Haber first\nreported that light irradiation could release free cyanide from potassium\nferrocyanide^49 and, later, the evolution of cyanide on light exposure was\nalso demonstrated for potassium ferricyanide^50. The cyanide solution can\ndissolve gold, known as the Elsner equation, and was conventionally used in\ngold mining industries. In this work, preparation of the Murakami\u2019s reagent\nwas conducted under minimum ambient light, and the etching was performed in\ncomplete darkness to avoid the evolution of cyanide that attacks Au. In\nsummary, the susceptibility of Ti_3C_2 slabs to oxidation is greater than that\nof Au, which is negligible under the dark condition of the etching in this\nwork.\n\nTo hamper the coalescence of goldene layers and stabilize them, the Murakami\u2019s\nreagent was mixed with various surfactants: CTAB, cysteine and cysteamine.\nCTAB comprises 16-carbon tails and an ammonium head group with three methyl\ngroups and a common surfactant to tailor morphologies of Au nanoparticles.\nCTAB covers the Au surface as a bilayer that hinders the agglomeration of the\nAu nanoparticles. Cysteine and cysteamine are unique biosynthetic small\nmolecules containing both amine and thiol functional groups. The thiols are\nused in a wide range of applications to stabilize and functionalize the planar\ngold surfaces^51. Meanwhile, methyl and amine groups also have a strong\naffinity towards the Au surfaces^52.\n\nCysteine, of which the thiol group attaches to the Au surface, is more inert\nto oxidation than cysteine that is further away from the Au. This is because\nthe oxidation of cysteine takes place preferentially by taking away the\nhydrogen from the thiol group to form the disulfide cysteine. Thus, the\nnascent oxygen on the surface of carbides slabs would oxidize excess cysteine,\nwhich does not reach the Au surface, to form cystine. Similarly, excess\ncysteamine would also readily oxidize to form the disulfide cystamine by the\nnascent oxygen. These disulfide by-products are twice as large as cysteine and\ncysteamine, and there is less possibility of them diffusing in between the\ngoldene layers during the etching of the intercalated MAX-phase host, although\ntheir affinity towards the Au surfaces would endure as the amine functional\ngroups remain. Therefore, goldene layers were observed near the MAX edges\nwhere large surfactants can reach in between the Au layers.\n\n### Electron microscopy\n\nStructural analysis was carried out by plan-view and cross-sectional HR-STEM\nwith high angle annular dark field imaging using Link\u00f6ping\u2019s double CS-\ncorrected FEI Titan^3 60\u2013300 microscope operated at 60 and 300 keV. HR-\nSTEM\u2013high angle annular dark field imaging was performed using a 21.5 mrad\nprobe convergence angle. The corresponding cross-sectional and plan-view\nsamples were mechanically polished to a thickness of about 50 \u03bcm, followed by\nion-beam milling with Ar^+ in a Gatan precision ion polishing system at 5 keV\nwith a final polishing step at 0.8 keV of ion energy. To reduce excessive\nsample heating, the temperature of the sample holder was kept at about 100 K\nby liquid nitrogen during the ion-milling.\n\n### XPS\n\nXPS analyses were performed in Axis Ultra DLD instrument from Kratos\nAnalytical at a base pressure better than 1.1 \u00d7 10^\u22129 Torr (1.5 \u00d7 10^\u22127 Pa).\nMonochromatic Al K\u03b1 radiation (h\u03bd = 1,486.6 eV) was used with the anode power\nset to 150 W. All spectra were recorded at a normal emission angle. The\nanalyser pass energy was 20 eV, which yielded a FWHM of 0.47 eV for the Ag\n3d_5/2 peak. The area analysed by XPS was a circle with a diameter of 100 \u03bcm.\nSpectrometer calibration was confirmed by measuring positions of Au 4f_7/2, Ag\n3d_5/2 and Cu 2p_3/2 peaks from sputter-etched Au, Ag and Cu samples and\ncomparison to the recommended ISO standards for monochromatic Al K\u03b1\nsources^32. All spectra were charge-referenced to the Fermi edge.\n\n### Simulations\n\nAIMD simulations were carried out using the VASP code implemented with the\nprojector augmented wave method^53,54 and the generalized-gradient electronic\nexchange and correlation approximation^55. An average temperature of 300 K was\ncontrolled via the Nos\u00e9\u2013Hoover thermostat (NVT ensemble). The classical\nequations of motion were integrated in time steps of 1 fs. Spin-orbit coupling\nand relativistic effects were neglected. The van der Waals interactions were\nmodelled using Grimme\u2019s approximation^56. At each ionic step, the energy was\ncalculated with accuracy of 10^\u20135 eV per supercell, using a 300 eV cut-off for\nthe planewave basis set and \u0393-point sampling of the reciprocal space. Detailed\ninformation on the AIMD simulations can be found in Supplementary Section 3.\nElectronic structures were also calculated within the DFT framework and the\nprojector augmented wave method. Free-standing goldene and Ti_3AuC_2 were\ncalculated using 29 \u00d7 29 \u00d7 3 k-points, while bulk Au was calculated with 29 \u00d7\n29 \u00d7 29 k-points sampling of the Brillouin zone using a Monkhorst\u2013Pack\nscheme^57. The energy cut-off for plane waves included in the expansion of\nwave functions was 400 eV. The Au 4f core-level shifts of free-standing\ngoldene and Ti_3AuC_2 were calculated according to the initial state\napproximation^58,59,60 (Supplementary Section 6).\n\n## Data availability\n\nThe data supporting the findings of this work are available within the\narticle, the corresponding Supplementary Information and the public data\nrepository figshare: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.24584940 (ref. ^61).\n\n## References\n\n  1.
