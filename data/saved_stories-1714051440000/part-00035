Over the first\nthree months of 2024 the candidates were never more than three points apart in\nour average of national polls, with Mr Trump narrowly ahead for most of that\ntime. That is new for Mr Trump: in his two previous presidential campaigns he\nnever led a general-election polling average for a single day. More worrying\nstill for Mr Biden, Mr Trump is ahead in several of the swing states that he\nlost in 2020. The outcome in half a dozen states\u2014 Arizona, Georgia, Michigan,\nNevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin\u2014is likely to prove decisive. A small but\ncritical slice of voters who plumped for Mr Biden back then are now telling\npollsters that they plan to defect. Who are they?\n\nTo find out, we built a statistical model to assess how a hypothetical voter\nmight cast a ballot, based on their demographic traits. Our data come from\nYouGov, an online pollster, which every week surveys over a thousand people\nabout their demographic profile, voting history and voting intentions. We\ncombined all its survey results since January 2023 to get a detailed portrait\nof Americans\u2019 voting preferences. Use the drop-down menus below to plug in any\ncombination of attributes\u2014age, sex, religion and more\u2014to construct a\nhypothetical American and see our estimate of their vote. Or press shuffle to\nsee a voter at random. Our model will continuously update to incorporate each\nweek\u2019s YouGov survey.\n\n## Build an American voter\n\n### Chance of voting for president*, %\n\n## How this group compares to others\n\n#### Gay white men aged 55-64 from a city in California, who are atheist and\nhave a college degree\n\n*Excluding don't know, won't vote and other parties\n\nThe voters propelling Mr Trump\u2019s polling renaissance might come as a surprise.\nWhile white voters\u2019 preferences have changed little since 2020, racial\nminorities\u2014historically the bedrock of Democratic support\u2014have lurched away\nfrom Mr Biden. Mr Trump has also sharply cut into his successor\u2019s advantage\namong young voters, another core Democratic group. Mr Biden will hope these\nonce-loyal Democrats return to the fold once the campaign heats up.\n\n## Latina women aged 25-34\n\n#### Shifted towards Trump\n\n## Black people aged 35-54\n\n#### Became less committed to Biden\n\n## Atheists\n\n#### Remained loyal to Biden\n\n## White evangelicals\n\n#### Remained loyal to Trump\n\nRace is often cited as the central cleavage in American politics, yet the\nsingle most powerful predictor of voting intention is religion. A model that\nknows nothing save for respondents\u2019 religious affiliations can correctly\nidentify their preferred candidate 62% of the time, compared with 59% for\nrace. Of Mormons and evangelical voters, 73% say they support Mr Trump. This\ncompares with just 13% of avowed atheists.\n\n## Most likely to make you a Biden voter\n\n## Most likely to make you a Trump voter\n\nRather than the sharp realignment that took place in 2016 and 2020, when Mr\nTrump attracted working-class white voters while shedding college-educated\nones, the voters swinging in either direction this year are more alike: they\ntend to be young; black or Hispanic; and live in cities. This suggests they\nhave looser party alliances and pay less attention to politics.\n\nSo both sides will think they can win as the election approaches. And you can\nuse this tool to explore the type of voter\u2014a 40-year-old high-school-educated\nblack man from rural Georgia, say\u2014who might just swing it.\u25a0\n\nStay up to date on American politics with our new daily update, The US in\nbrief.

We gathered all results since the start of 2023, amounting to nearly\n100,000 individual responses. We have removed people who did not say they\nplanned to vote for either Joe Biden or Donald Trump in this year\u2019s\npresidential election.\n\nTo estimate voting intentions based on demographic profiles, we fit a logistic\nregression model using the LASSO method, a statistical technique that\neliminates or reduces the impact of certain variables in order to maximise\naccuracy on unseen data. Our model accounts not just for the eight demographic\nfeatures detailed above in isolation, but also for how they interact with each\nother. For example, switching the listed age group from 75+ to 18-24 sharply\nincreases the chances that a white voter will support Mr Biden, but actually\nreduces this probability for a black voter. Our model also incorporates the\nnational poll average for the two leading candidates in each week. As a\nresult, if one of them gains or loses ground in the polls overall, the model\nwill automatically shift vote-intention probabilities for each demographic\nprofile in the same direction. We update the model every week to account for\nadditional survey data and new national polling averages.\n\nSources: YouGov; The Economist\n\n## More coverage of the election\n\n### Truth Social is a mind-bending win for Donald Trump\n\nAnd disturbing evidence of how he destabilises reality for Americans\n\n### The White House unveils a pair of bad policies to woo voters\n\nTariffs for steelworkers and loan forgiveness for students are both regressive\n\n### Donald Trump\u2019s first criminal trial will be both momentous and tawdry\n\nBut will it even matter?\n\n### True swing voters are extraordinarily rare in America\n\nWe have found some\n\n  * Subscribe\n  * Group subscriptions\n  * Reuse our content\n  * Help and contact us\n\n## Keep updated\n\nPublished since September 1843 to take part in \u201ca severe contest between\nintelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance\nobstructing our progress.\u201d\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Manage Cookies\n  * Accessibility\n  * Modern Slavery Statement\n  * Sitemap\n  * Your Data Rights\n\nCopyright \u00a9 The Economist Newspaper Limited 2024.
