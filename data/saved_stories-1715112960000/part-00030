Jones\n\n25 Apr 2024\n\n5 min read\n\niStock\n\nEver since Return of the Jedi premiered in 1983, people have been imagining\nthe day when they, like the film\u2019s protagonist Luke Skywalker, would get to\nride speeder bikes that zip across the landscape while hovering just a few\nmeters above the ground. In the intervening years, there have been numerous\nclaims made by companies that they\u2019ve figured out how to make a real-world\nproduct that mimics movie magic. Their demos and PR campaigns have continued\nto whet the public\u2019s appetite for hoverbikes, but there are some solid reasons\nwhy the nascent hoverbike industry has yet to get airborne.\n\n\u201cit\u2019s gonna happen, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll happen in your lifetime and\nmine,\u201d says Ronald Barrett-Gonzalez, an aerospace-engineering professor at the\nUniversity of Kansas. \u201cWith the current approaches, I think it\u2019s just going to\nbe a while.\u201d\n\nBarrett-Gonzalez was the advisor for a group of University of Kansas\naerospace-engineering grad students who participated in the GoFly competition,\nsponsored by Boeing. The challenge\u2014in which 3,800 teams from 100 countries\nparticipated\u2014was to \u201cdesign and build a safe, quiet, ultra-compact, near-VTOL\npersonal flying device capable of flying 20 miles [32 kilometers] while\ncarrying a single person.\u201d\n\nThe eventual grand prize winner was to have been awarded US $1 million, and\n$250,000 prizes were supposed to have gone to the quietest and the smallest\ncompliant GoFly entries when the challenge concluded in September 2023. But\nthe scheduled final fly-off between the teams whose personal aircraft were\nselected as the best-built entries in the second of the competition\u2019s three\nphases was canceled because windy conditions made it unsafe for the machines\nto take to the skies.\n\n### Solving the Physics of Hoverbikes\n\n\u201cHelicopters, for a long time, have been built with relatively small engines\nfor their size,\u201d says Barrett-Gonzalez. \u201cThe way that such large vehicles can\nbe lifted by small engines is that they have large rotor diameters. The volume\nof the column of air that they stand on is great. If you look at hoverbikes,\nthe diameters of their rotors are much smaller. And physics says that you need\nmore power per unit weight to lift an aircraft like that.\u201d\n\nTo get the efficiency that comes along with a helicopter\u2019s extensive rotor\nsweep, hoverbike designers will likely have to give up the thought of these\nmachines touching down in parking spots meant for cars, or at least wait for\nnew generations of engines and electric motors with greater power density to\nappear along with batteries capable of delivering a lot more power and storing\na lot more energy than those available today.\n\n### Assessing Hoverbikes\u2019 Risks\n\nSafety concerns are just as big a hurdle to making hoverbikes available for\nsale. The University of Kansas team\u2019s GoFly entry, called Mamba, had been one\nof 10 Phase I winners for best design. The six-rotored hexcopter, which\nemphasized safety, certifiability, and performance, featured shrouded rotors\nand a tilting stabilizer surface.\n\nThe University of Kansas\u2019 GoFly entry is a red-and-black hexcopter with two\nlarge and two small horizontal rotors, and two vertically placed rotors in the\nback. University of Kansas\n\nBut Mamba didn\u2019t make it through Phase II, the build stage. Barrett-Gonzalez\nexplains that \u201cthe kinds of safety criteria that we hold to are enforced by\nrules and regulations, such as the U.S. government\u2019s FAR 23 airworthiness\nstandards that govern small airplanes and FAR 27 standards for smaller\nhelicopters.\u201d That standard of safety, he says, is meant to ensure that the\nprobability of a fatal event is no greater than one in 1 million flight hours.\n\u201cFor larger aircraft like the big Boeing commercial jets and larger\nhelicopters, the standard is even more stringent. It\u2019s one in 1 billion flight\nhours.\u201d\n\nThat focus on safety doesn\u2019t come without a cost, Barrett-Gonzalez adds. \u201cThe\ncurrent thing that is keeping an aircraft like the Mamba from going from the\ndrawing board to reality is that it\u2019s costly. We could do what a Star\nWarspodracer can do, but that\u2019s a $3.2 million machine. And then, only maybe\nElon Musk and half a dozen other people could afford it.\u201d\n\nSeveral would-be hoverbike manufacturers have enticed potential buyers with\nprice points more than an order of magnitude lower than Barrett-Gonzalez\u2019s\nestimate. But Barrett-Gonzalez points out that they don\u2019t include the\ncombination of safety features built into the Mamba design. The Mamba has a\nroll cage, and the motors are cross-shafted. \u201cSo if you lose one motor you\ndon\u2019t come spiraling out of the sky,\u201d he says. What\u2019s more, the Mamba\u2019s rotors\nare arranged according to a patented design that the team says makes it\nimpossible for a rider or bystander to come in contact with the machine\u2019s\nspinning blades.\n\nFor anyone who might argue that the Mamba project imploded because of\noverdesign, Barrett-Gonzalez recalls the Mamba team having extensive briefings\nwith the director of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s small\nairplanes directorate. \u201cAnd he put it plainly: \u2018The FAA will not certify a\nhuman eggbeater,\u2019\u201d says Barrett-Gonzalez.\n\n\u201cWe could do what a Star Wars podracer can do, but that\u2019s a $3.2 million\nmachine. And then, only maybe Elon Musk and half a dozen other people could\nafford it.\u201d \u2014Ronald Barrett-Gonzalez, University of Kansas\n\nHover (a hoverbike hopeful formerly known as Hoversurf) recently moved its\nheadquarters from California back to Russia, and Joby Aviation decided to\nstart its electric vertical-takeoff-and-landing (eVTOL) air taxi business in\nDubai. These moves might not necessarily indicate their need to generate\nrevenue before refinements to their designs will give them the ability to meet\nU.S. safety standards. But that explanation is as plausible as any. \u201cNeither\nRussia nor Dubai have mature airborne safety standards that cover vehicles of\nthis type,\u201d says Barrett-Gonzalez.\n\n### Where Are They Now?\n\nIn 2014, IEEE Spectrum reported on Aerofex\u2019s pledge to deliver a commercially\navailable hoverbike, the Aero-X, by 2017. Spoiler alert: It didn\u2019t happen.\nThough Aerofex is still in business, the company retired the Aero-X before the\naircraft\u2019s anticipated go-to-market date. The company proudly recalls the\nprogress it made during Aero-X\u2019s development, including kinesthetic control,\nwhich lets the pilot stabilize and control a personal aircraft by shifting\ntheir weight pretty much the same way one does when riding a bike. But 16\nyears after its 2008 maiden flight, the $85,000 Aero-X is still not available\nfor sale.\n\nSeven years after its initial go-to-market date, Aerofex\u2019s Aero-X is still not\navailable for sale.Aerofex\n\nMeanwhile, Hover\u2019s series of Scorpion hoverbike designs have gotten plenty of\npress attention. But as of this writing, the company\u2019s flying motorcycles are\nstill in the preorder stage, with no indication regarding when models like the\n$150,000 S-3 will be delivered to people who put down deposits.\n\nAnd Tetra Aviation, the Tokyo startup that won the $100,000 Pratt & Whitney\nDisruptor Award by the GoFly judges for its Mk-5 single-seat eVTOL vehicle, is\nalso stuck in the development phase. Tetra said it planned to offer the Mk-5,\nwith its 32 vertical lift rotors distributed across long, thin, aluminum-and-\ncarbon-fiber wings and a single pusher prop at the rear, for $320,000,\nbeginning in 2022. But the 8.5-meter wide, 6.1-meter-long machine, which is\nsupposed to travel 160 kilometers (at speeds up to 160 kilometers per hour) on\na single charge, is still in the preorder stage.\n\nAccording to the statements made by the companies seeking to market\nhoverbikes, the vehicles have been two or three years away for more than a\ndecade. The market predictions made by these companies are starting to sound a\nlot like an old saw about nuclear fusion, which claims fusion has been \u201cjust\n20 years away\u201d for nearly 50 years.\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * World's Highest Wind Turbine Will Hover Above Alaska \u203a\n  * Aero-X Hoverbike To Go on Sale in 2017 \u203a\n\nRelated Articles Around the Web\n\n  * Hoverbike - Wikipedia \u203a\n\nhoverbikeevtolgoflymamba\n\nWillie D.
