The god of\nelectronics has blessed me with the motivation to tinker during my flights.\nI\u2019m in a bit of a pickle, though... what laptop should I bring?\n\n  * I don\u2019t want to bring my work laptop. It\u2019s too big and I want to practice some \u201chealthy detachment\u201d from work.\n\n  * I don\u2019t have a lightweight personal laptop that\u2019s enjoyable to goof around on.\n\nThe solution for me, an irrational simpleton, was to spend perhaps too much\nmoney ($200) on a questionable Raspberry Pi \u201claptop\u201d.\n\nThe official name of this product is CrowPi-L but mine only answers to the\nmoniker of pcrowDoodle my beloved.\n\n(This is not an \u201caffiliate shill\u201d post; I have nothing to disclose.)\n\n## \u201claptop\u201d#\n\npcrowDoodle is best thought of as the computer-equivalent of Armadillo:\nOpossum Heavy Armor:\n\nYou just lift the magnetically (??) attached back cover...\n\n...and cram your RPi into the corner...\n\n...and you\u2019re basically ready to fire pcrowDoodle up and realize that there\u2019s\nsome boot firmware that\u2019s impossible to update at best and backdoor\u2019d at\nworst:\n\nI\u2019m using RPi 4. I have a hunch RPi5 won\u2019t work.\n\n## Form factor: wedgebot#\n\nCramming the RPi into the back results in a slope steep enough to downhill\nrace on:\n\nWheely Big Cheese is dead, long live Wheely Big Cheese!\n\n## \u201cDual boot\u201d: quite pleasant, actually#\n\npcrowDoodle came with a little SD expansion thingy that lets you switch\nbetween an \u201cA\u201d SD card and a \u201cB\u201d SD card fairly quickly:\n\nRPi OS booted up pretty much without a hitch:\n\nAnd I even got OpenBSD working on the other SD!\n\nPretty excited to finally try out BSD. Gonna leave it GUI-free.\n\n## Unusable trackpad: a blessing in disguise#\n\nThe trackpad is comically small and has already started to freeze up on me:\n\nGoing into the purchase I expected this. I was kinda hoping for it,\nactually... I\u2019ve been meaning to get really solid at keyboard-based\nnavigation. This is the main \u201cdesirable difficulty\u201d thing for me. A cool side-\neffect of forcing myself to get good at keyboard-based navigation is that I\u2019m\nalso learning the CLI-equivalent for common actions, such as dm-tool lock to\nlock the screen.\n\nLobsters on lynx somehow looks better than the actual website??\n\n## 40-pin GPIO header#\n\nYou need a connector (which was annoyingly not included with my purchase) but\nit\u2019s still possible to access all the pins:\n\n## Battery#\n\nI got 3-5 hours on the first full charge. I fully expect this to drop down to\n30 minutes after a month.\n\nAn interesting challenge (maybe project?) is that the RPi OS UI doesn\u2019t seem\nto expect to run off battery so there\u2019s no \u201clow battery\u201d indicator. So when\nthe battery\u2019s done pcrowDoodle abruptly shuts down on me. Maybe there\u2019s just\nsome bit in raspi-config I need to flip.\n\nMy coworker, Rob, had the interesting idea to supplement the battery reserves\nwith a cellphone power bank. The power bank would probably have some \u201clow\ncharge\u201d indicator, too.\n\n## Where have all the RPi laptops gone#\n\nI\u2019ve poked fun at Elecrow (the maker of the CrowPi-L) a few times but it seems\nlike they deserve my thanks and respect: \u201cRPi laptop\u201d is a cool idea and they\nseem to be one of only a handful of companies actually making it happen.\n\nRPi OS is a sweet spot for exploratory hacking IMO:\n\n  * It\u2019s trivial to set up on an SD card\n\n  * It comes pre-loaded with lots of interesting stuff (for name in $(ls /bin); do man -f $name; done)\n\n  * It\u2019s the same ecosystem of tools/programs/etc. as my work env (<3 Debian <3)\n\n  * The RPi hardware itself really invites you to learn about it on a deeper level. Have you seen those datasheets? Delightful\n\n## Worth it?#\n\nToo soon to tell. I\u2019ll report back after Japan. It will boil down to\nreliability; if this thing starts crashing or the keys start sticking then I\u2019m\nscrewed.\n\nAt first I thought $200 was too expensive but realistically, it would cost me\nmuch more than $200 in time/energy/parts/hairline to try to build something\nlike this myself.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Kayce Basques\n\nBio-digital jazz, man\n\n    \n    \n    \u2282_\u30fd \\\\ \u039b_\u039b \\( \u02c7\u03c9\u02c7) / \u2312 / \u3078 \\ / / \\\\ | \u30ce \u30fd_\u3064 / / per ( (\u30fd my | |\u3001 \\last | \u4e3f \\ \\ email | | ) / \u30ce_) L\u30ce\n\ntechnologycat src\n\nwebsite src\n\n", "frontpage": false}
