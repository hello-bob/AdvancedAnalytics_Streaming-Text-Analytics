The co-owner of the bookstore started by reading through the\nstore\u2019s upcoming events flier, pausing to extemporize on each event. This took\na full 10 minutes. Then she spent 5 minutes talking about the plight of\nindependent bookstores, and how they need money to do things like community\nbook nights, and hey she\u2019s got this newsletter sign-up sheet that she\u2019s going\nto pass around. And while we\u2019re at it, the store actually has two different\nemail newsletters that they send out, and she described them both in great\ndetail. Another sign-up sheet is passed around.\n\nHaving already wasted close to 20 minutes of our time, she launched into a\nsynopsis of the book, interspersed with her own impressions, leaving no\nsecondary character or minor scene unnamed. Worst of all, the book has a\nrather large twist in the second half, and she was explicitly hinting at what\nit is. Someone in the audience actually yelled out, \u201cDon\u2019t give it away!\u201d This\nwas advice she did not take.\n\nThis is an extreme example, by far the worst I\u2019ve ever seen, but author\nintroduction crimes are rampant. I was recently at a literary festival where\nat least 10 of the roughly 15 author introductions I saw were painful to sit\nthrough. I take this issue seriously because I was an author events\ncoordinator at Brookline Booksmith for two years, and we took pride in our\nauthor introductions. The willingness and ability to carefully craft a good\nauthor introduction, in fact, was part of my job interview.\n\nAuthor introductions, in my opinion, are about courtesy. Should a beloved,\nPulitzer Prize-winning author have to hear the president of Northwestern\u2019s\nJewish students\u2019 society call him Michael Sha-BONE eight times in two minutes?\nNo. Because he flew across the country to speak for 50 minutes in your\noverheated auditorium and you have the internet. A good author introduction\nshows the author that you\u2019re excited to be a partner in promoting their work\nand that you value the role their career plays on the literary stage, all\nwhile being informative and \u2013 lord have mercy \u2013 brief.\n\nHow To Introduce an Author\n\nStep 1. Find Out Who the Author Is\n\nGet your details straight. Look up the pronunciation of their name, even if\nyou think you know it. If a definitive answer is elusive, ask their publicist,\nagent, or whoever set up the event with you. Otherwise, ask the author when\nthey arrive, before you hit the microphone with some garbled version of\nEugenides.\n\nFind out what books they\u2019ve written. Don\u2019t say that Stay Awake is Dan Chaon\u2019s\nfifth novel. He\u2019s written two novels, but this is his third story collection.\nDo you think A History of Love is Nicole Krauss\u2019s first book? Wrong! Look it\nup. If you find yourself introducing someone like Michael Chabon, who\u2019s\nwritten novels, short stories, essays, comic books, and children\u2019s books, just\navoid taxonomy and say he\u2019s prolific.\n\nFind out what awards they\u2019ve won, where they teach (currently), and what\nperiodicals they write for. More on this later.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t had time to do your research, don\u2019t guess, and definitely don\u2019t\n\u2014 as I saw someone do last weekend \u2014 turn to Kevin Brockmeier in the middle of\nyour introduction and say \u201cIs The View From the Seventh Layer a novel?\u201d I\nshudder.\n\nStep 2. Weed Out Unnecessary/Unimpressive Details\n\nSo you\u2019ve printed out the author\u2019s Wikipedia entry. Don\u2019t include the fact\nthat they teach creative writing part-time at Eastern Nevada State. Don\u2019t\nmention that they won the Central North Carolina Writer\u2019s Prize. Don\u2019t say\nthat they were included on Entertainment Weekly\u2019s 100 Authors to Watch list.\n\nThese details do two things \u2014 they make the author look small-time, and they\ngive the impression that you\u2019re desperate for any scrap of information to fill\nout your introduction.\n\nWhich Brings Us to Step 3. Include Personal Impressions\n\nPersonal impressions of the author\u2019s work should be the bulk of your\nintroduction. Ideally, they will be your personal impressions. During my first\nyear as an events coordinator, I read each author\u2019s book before I hosted their\nevent, a debatably unnecessary gesture with enormous dividends.\n\nFirstly, it is yet another step you can take to avoid looking like an idiot.\nThe room is full of people who\u2019ve most likely come to hear the author because\nthey\u2019ve read their work. It\u2019s embarrassing when the person at the microphone\nis the only one who hasn\u2019t.\n\nSecondly, it will endear you greatly to the author. Consult any number of\nessays written by authors on the drudgery of the book tour, and you\u2019ll know\nthat being greeted by someone who\u2019s taken the time to prepare for their visit\nis a rare and lovely thing.\n\nThirdly, nothing is more compelling than sincerity. Speaking thoughtfully and\ngraciously about your reading experience will get the whole room, including\nthe author, excited about the event far more than a list of writing prizes\nthey\u2019ve won, or periodicals they\u2019ve contributed to. Listening to someone\nintroduce one of their favorite authors can be really beautiful.\n\nI spent two days writing an introduction for Jonathan Safran Foer. I read\nExtremely Loud & Incredibly Close and I reread Everything is Illuminated. I\nquoted both books. I talked about his critical reputation and my own love for\nhis work both as a reader and as a bookseller. After the event he asked me if\nI would sign my printed out copy of the introduction for him to keep. I\u2019m sure\nhe doesn\u2019t have it anymore, but it was absolutely the best moment of my nine-\nyear bookselling career.\n\nThat introduction, by the way, was 235 words long.\n\nSo Obviously Step 4 is Wrap It Up\n\n500 words maximum. Absolutely no more than 500 words. 200-300 words is ideal,\nbut 500 words is the limit. No exceptions, friends, 500 words.\n\nDo your homework. Communicate enthusiasm. Get out of the way.\n\nCaveats on Introducing a Famous Author\n\nIf you\u2019re in a theater with a few hundred people, you don\u2019t need to convince\nanybody that the author you\u2019re introducing is impressive. They know that,\nthat\u2019s why they\u2019re in a theatre. Stick to two or three of the most impressive\ndetails. \u201cMarilynne Robinson is a Pulitzer Prize-winning author who teaches at\nthe Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop\u201d does the trick as far as eminence goes. A long,\nlong list of accomplishments isn\u2019t impressive, it\u2019s tiresome. Jennifer Egan\nwas included in Best American Short Stories? No kidding. She\u2019s Jennifer Egan.\n\nUnless it\u2019s short, pithy, and you\u2019re working it into one of your sentences,\nyou don\u2019t need to quote a famous author\u2019s reviewers. The New York Times thinks\nRichard Ford is a great writer? No kidding. He\u2019s Richard Ford.\n\nCaveats on Introducing a New/Not Famous Author\n\nPlease read the book. To avoid filling the introduction with the only vaguely\nimpressive accolades we talked about earlier, read the book and say something\nnice about it.\n\nIn this case, it is great to quote reviewers. Not everyone gets to teach at\nIowa, but a lot more people get reviewed by a major newspaper. Quoting these\nreviews puts the author in the big leagues. If you find a great review of the\nbook, but it\u2019s not in a well-known publication, just attribute it to \u201cone\nreviewer,\u201d not \u201ca reviewer in the Tuscaloosa Daily Press.\u201d\n\nMiscellaneous Tips\n\nDon\u2019t list everything the author has ever written. Five titles maximum, or one\nor two from a few different genres.\n\nDon\u2019t synopsize anything but the book the author is currently promoting.\n\nAny synopsis you do give of the current book should be one sentence long.\n\nDon\u2019t pretend like you have plans to read the author. Comments like \u201cI can\u2019t\nwait to get my hands on this book\u201d or \u201cA Thousand Acres has been on my to-be-\nread pile for a long time\u201d are condescending and blatantly untrue. If you were\ngoing to read the book, you would have done it.\n\nDo quote the author in the introduction.\n\nDo get housekeeping details \u2014 where the signing line will be, where to buy the\nbooks \u2014 out of the way before you start your introduction.\n\nIf you\u2019re introducing a joint reading or a panel, don\u2019t make one author sound\nmore impressive than the others.\n\nPrint out your introduction (you\u2019ve worked so hard!), practice reading it out\nloud before the event, and don\u2019t go off script.\n\nImage via Wikimedia Commons\n\nTwitterShare\n\nThe Millions' future depends on your support.
