And second, as a sort of\nstaging area for takes. Sometimes those takes are intentionally trollish,\nwhile others contain the seed of something more serious. Here is one recent\nexample:\n\nWait, was I serious about this one? Yeah, more or less. If I were advising a\nfriend\u2019s son or daughter facing Decision Day, I\u2019d tell them to pass on the Ivy\nLeague and go to a high-quality state school instead under some conditions.\nLet me articulate some exceptions:\n\nSilver Bulletin is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and\nsupport my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\n  * If the student\u2019s identity were deeply tied up into being a Princeton Man or a Cornell Woman or whatever, then I\u2019d think that was a little weird \u2014 but by all means I\u2019d tell them to go, I\u2019m not here to kink-shame.\n\n  * I\u2019d also tell them to go with the elite private college if (i) they had a high degree of confidence in what they wanted to do with their degree and (ii) it was in a field like law that regards the credential as particularly valuable.\n\n  * And I\u2019d tell them to strongly consider going if they came from an economically disadvantaged background and had been offered a golden ticket to join the elite. I\u2019m not super familiar with the literature on the selective college wage premium, but it\u2019s among this group of disadvantaged students where the benefits seem to be concentrated.\n\nBut if this student was just going to school to \u201cfind herself\u201d \u2014 and she or\nher parents were footing most of the bill? Yeah, probably go with the top-\nflight state school \u2014 especially if she\u2019s in a state with a very good in-state\npublic school where the cost savings are much greater. Better that than to\nemerge with a mountain of debt and a degree from an institution that is likely\nto be viewed as highly polarizing. Public perceptions of higher education have\ndeclined rapidly, and I expect the problems to get worse.\n\nBefore we proceed further, one unavoidable question: am I being a hypocrite?\nAlthough I come from a Big Ten town \u2014 my dad was a professor at Michigan State\nUniversity \u2014 I went to the University of Chicago. Chicago is now considered an\nelite private school but was much less of one when I first attended in 1996\nwith an admit rate of around 40 percent. Still, this is a little bit\nmisleading \u2014 U of C\u2019s student body was famously \u201cself-selected\u201d to the school\n\u201cwhere fun comes to die\u201d1. And my tuition looks like a bargain as compared to\ntoday, it wasn\u2019t cheap by late-90\u2019s standards.\n\nBut Chicago has always been an outlier. In my era, at least, it tended to\nattract its share of weird nerds who were turned on precisely by the school\u2019s\nreputation for weird nerdiness. Chicago has also always been a politically\npluralistic school, with strong institutional commitments to free speech, an\nemphasis on the core curriculum, less grade inflation than comparable schools,\nand less of a boost for legacy admits. I\u2019m undoubtedly biased, but I think\nthat if other schools had been run like Chicago, elite higher ed would have\nfewer problems than it has today.\n\nEven if I had gone to Harvard though \u2014 applied, didn\u2019t get in2, by the way \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t think that would make me a hypocrite because my argument is that this\nchange has been relatively recent and that many of the downstream effects are\nstill to come.\n\n####\n\nPerceptions of higher ed are cratering\n\nEven in a period when nearly all American institutions are losing public\ntrust, the decline in confidence for higher education stands out. In 2015, 57\npercent of Americans had a \u201cgreat deal\u201d or \u201cquite a lot\u201d of confidence in\nhigher education, according to Gallup polling. By summer 2023, that number had\ndeclined to just 36 percent. The decline has been especially bad among\nRepublicans \u2014 although only 32 percent of independents have confidence in\nhigher education, and the numbers have also declined among Democrats:\n\nGranted, the Gallup poll didn\u2019t mention elite private colleges specifically,\nalthough I\u2019d expect them to trigger an even more polarized response. A 2022\npoll for New America found that fewer Americans think private colleges (72\npercent) than public colleges (78 percent) contribute positively to the\nworkforce. They also said private colleges are considerably less likely to be\nworth the cost:\n\nThese polls, furthermore, preceded the December 2023 congressional hearings\nthat eventually led to the ouster of Penn president Liz Magill and Harvard\npresident Claudine Gay (though in Gay\u2019s case, it was more because of credible\nallegations that she was a serial plagiarist). They also preceded the recent\nwave of protests on the campuses of Columbia and other elite schools,\nvariously described as pro-Palestine or anti-Israel depending on the news\noutlet.3\n\nThere is some initial evidence that the Congressional hearings did matter to\npublic opinion, at least when it came to Harvard \u2014 its net favorable ratings\ndeclined by 15 percent after the hearings according to Morning Consult\npolling, with the decrease concentrated among Republicans:\n\nIt\u2019s harder to find concrete data on what elites think about higher education.\nBy \u201celites\u201d I mean people broadly with a lot of power, wealth and influence;\nI\u2019m not just using the term as a synonym for \u201cintellectuals\u201d. In my\nforthcoming book, in fact, I explore the clash between two rival clans of\nelites \u2014 the analytical, risk-taking professions like finance and tech[4] that\nI call \u201cthe River\u201d on the one hand, and a triad of more intellectual\nprofessions (academia, the media and government) that I call \u201cthe Village\u201d on\nthe other hand. In the book, I argue that these groups are natural rivals \u2014\nand their clashes have become more explicit recently, like in Wall Street and\nSilicon Valley helping to lead the charge against the university presidents.\n\nSo to some extent, I\u2019m asking you to trust my reporting from a book that isn\u2019t\npublic yet \u2014 and my general exposure to the discourse, because surely I\nqualify as an \u201celite\u201d myself as I\u2019ve defined it \u2014 in my prediction that tech\nand finance are going to become much less tolerant of what they see as\nbullshit coming out of academia. This week, for instance, Google \u2014 despite\nprobably being the most progressive or Silicon Valley company, nevertheless\nfired dozens of employees involved in pro-Palestine/anti-Israel protests that\nresemble those on university campuses.\n\nImportantly, I expect the decline in perceptions of elite private colleges to\nextend to people tasked with making hiring decisions. I expect an increasing\nnumber of hiring managers to look at two resumes \u2014 say, one from a recent\ngraduate of Columbia, and one from a recent graduate of the University of the\nNorth Carolina \u2014 and potentially see advantages for the UNC student. They\u2019ll\nregard the Columbia grad as:\n\n  * More likely to be coddled;\n\n  * More likely to hold strong political opinions that will distract from their work;\n\n  * More likely to have benefited from grade inflation and perhaps dubious admissions policies.\n\nTech and finance aren\u2019t the only professions, obviously. And you could\ndecrease the premium associated with a Harvard or Yale or Columbia degree by\n30 percent and it would still be highly valuable. Modern universities serve a\nlot of different functions and many of them won\u2019t be affected. But I expect\nthe decline in prestige to be enough to have material effects on the value of\nthese degrees, enough they\u2019re no longer \u201cworth it\u201d for some students on the\nmargin.\n\n####\n\nElite higher ed will have a hard time turning perceptions around\n\nOnce perceptions of an institution become politically polarized, it is very\nhard to undo that. But I expect elite higher ed to have an especially big\nproblem.\n\nThat\u2019s because academia is a slow-moving institution. Academic faculty \u2014\nespecially if they receive tenure \u2014 often serve out their entire careers at\none or two institutions. Investments in new buildings or programs are expected\nto pay out over decades. There is an enormous amount of bureaucracy. Even a\nstudent, between the time they first apply to a college and when they\ngraduate, is making nearly a five-year commitment, and that\u2019s if they finish\non time, which many students don\u2019t.\n\nSo although there are some signs that schools recognize the scale of their\nproblems \u2014notably, in restoring standardized testing requirements \u2014 I think\nelite private colleges\u2019 problems are likely to worsen in the medium term.\nYounger faculty, some of whom were hired under regimes that required diversity\nstatements that are thinly-veiled political litmus tests, are much more more\ninto wokeness (or what I call Social Justice Leftism) than older faculty \u2014 and\nless supportive of traditional liberal values like free speech. And these\nproblems are likely to be self-reinforcing. If conservative students \u2014 or\napolitical students who just want to take their classes and goof off with\ntheir friends \u2014 are increasingly turned off by the political environment at\nelite private colleges, they won\u2019t attend, and that will in turn make these\ncolleges even more of a bubble with fewer relatively well-adjusted normies.\n\nAnd although so far I\u2019ve mostly cited lines of criticism from the right, elite\nprivate colleges are also vulnerable to critique from the left. As legacy\nadmissions make explicit, few institutions anywhere in society reinforce pre-\nexisting hierarchies more than places like Harvard, Stanford or Yale do. They\nare also incredibly wealthy institutions, with endowments that serve as de\nfacto hedge funds. And their admissions process is incredibly cynical,\nincluding sometimes recruiting students they know they don\u2019t want to lower\ntheir admissions rates and increase their rankings.\n\nThis might not be the analogy you\u2019re expecting, but in some ways the rapid\nshift in public perception against elite colleges reminds me of the rapid\nshift toward support for gay marriage in the 2010s. Gay marriage could be\njustified either on progressive grounds, since it created more rights for an\nhistorically marginalized group, or on conservative ones, since marriage is\nusually regarded as a stabilizing, conservative institution. Elite private\ncolleges are both hotbeds of left-wing radicalism and are places of incredible\nwealth and privilege and have abandoned many of the rigorous academic\nstandards and core principles like free speech that got them there in the\nfirst place. Leftists and liberals and conservatives all have reasons to\nregard them with suspicion, even as being a little cringe.\n\nSo fuck Harvard and fuck the rest of these schools4 \u2014 the correction in\nperceptions is long overdue. By all means go if it\u2019s in your best interest to\ndo so. But state colleges and institutions are much better institutions for\nsociety \u2014 one of the things that truly make America great \u2014 and often offer a\nmore well-rounded experience and a comparable education at a lower price.\n\nSilver Bulletin will launch presidential election forecasts in June. Take some\nof the money you save from not going to Harvard by signing up for the\nnewsletter instead.\n\n1\n\nI had a lot of fun, thank you very much.\n\n2\n\nI wasn\u2019t particularly interested in the Ivy League experience \u2014 instead, I\napplied to Chicago, plus some smaller colleges (Reed College and Williams\nCollege), plus the University of Michigan and Michigan State. But I figured\nHarvard was worth making an exception for, and I\u2019d probably have gone if I\u2019d\ngotten in.\n\n3\n\nI\u2019m going to refrain (for now) from commenting on these protests further, in\npart because I\u2019ve rarely felt so lost about a news story. There\u2019s clearly some\nanti-Semitism. There are clearly also some students exercising their First\nAmendment rights that university administrators have clumsily tried to\nabridge. There are clearly some students with deep, well-grounded concerns.\nThere are clearly also some students being dumb, spoiled college kids and\ntrying to look cool in front of their friends. And there are clearly some\ninterlopers from outside the universities intermingling with the students.\nI\u2019ve found it very hard to get a sense for what the ratios of these different\ncategories are or what the situation looks like on the ground.\n\n4\n\nExcept Chicago!\n\n### Subscribe to Silver Bulletin\n\nBy Nate Silver \u00b7 Thousands of paid subscribers\n\nEssays and analysis about elections, media, sports, poker, and all the other\nthings I care about.\n\n78 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n8 Restacks\n\n78\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Go to a state school\n\nwww.natesilver.net\n\n73\n\nShare\n\n73 Comments\n\nDH2 hrs agoIf your ultimate goal is a Ph.D. in a STEM field, you can do what I\ndid: Go to a big state university as an undergrad and then choose an elite,\npossibly private, school for graduate studies.
