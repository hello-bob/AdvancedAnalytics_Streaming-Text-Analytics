Will the CDC act\non it?\n\nA new report comes as the CDC is updating its guidance for infection control.\nA committee advising the agency seems poised to brush the latest science\naside.\n\nMedical staff members tend to a Covid patient at Mount Sinai South Nassau\nHospital in Oceanside, N.Y., in 2020. Jeffrey Basinger / Newsday via Getty\nImages file\n\nApril 30, 2024, 9:00 AM UTC\n\nBy Amy Maxmen | KFF Health News\n\nThe World Health Organization has issued a report that transforms how the\nworld understands respiratory infections like Covid, influenza and measles.\n\nMotivated by grave missteps in the pandemic, the WHO convened about 50 experts\nin virology, epidemiology, aerosol science, and bioengineering, among other\nspecialties, who spent two years poring through the evidence on how airborne\nviruses and bacteria spread.\n\nHowever, the WHO report stops short of prescribing actions that governments,\nhospitals, and the public should take in response. It remains to be seen how\nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will act on this information in\nits own guidance for infection control in health care settings.\n\nThe WHO concluded that airborne transmission occurs as sick people exhale\npathogens that remain suspended in the air, contained in tiny particles of\nsaliva and mucus that are inhaled by others.\n\nWhile it may seem obvious, and some researchers have pushed for this\nacknowledgment for more than a decade, an alternative dogma persisted \u2014 which\nkept health authorities from saying that Covid was airborne for many months\ninto the pandemic.\n\nSpecifically, they relied on a traditional notion that respiratory viruses\nspread mainly through droplets spewed out of an infected person\u2019s nose or\nmouth. These droplets infect others by landing directly in their mouth, nose,\nor eyes \u2014 or they get carried into these orifices on droplet-contaminated\nfingers. Although these routes of transmission still happen, particularly\namong young children, experts have concluded that many respiratory infections\nspread as people simply breathe in virus-laden air.\n\n\u201cThis is a complete U-turn,\u201d said Dr. Julian Tang, a clinical virologist at\nthe University of Leicester in the United Kingdom, who advised the WHO on the\nreport. He also helped the agency create an online tool to assess the risk of\nairborne transmission indoors.\n\nPeg Seminario, an occupational health and safety specialist in Bethesda,\nMaryland, welcomed the shift after years of resistance from health\nauthorities. \u201cThe dogma that droplets are a major mode of transmission is the\n\u2018flat Earth\u2019 position now,\u201d she said. \u201cHurray! We are finally recognizing that\nthe world is round.\u201d\n\nThe change puts fresh emphasis on the need to improve ventilation indoors and\nstockpile quality face masks before the next airborne disease explodes. Far\nfrom a remote possibility, measles is on the rise this year and the H5N1 bird\nflu is spreading among cattle in several states. Scientists worry that as the\nH5N1 virus spends more time in mammals, it could evolve to more easily infect\npeople and spread among them through the air.\n\nTraditional beliefs on droplet transmission help explain why the WHO and the\nCDC focused so acutely on hand-washing and surface-cleaning at the beginning\nof the pandemic. Such advice overwhelmed recommendations for N95 masks that\nfilter out most virus-laden particles suspended in the air. Employers denied\nmany health care workers access to N95s, insisting that only those routinely\nworking within feet of Covid patients needed them. More than 3,600 health care\nworkers died in the first year of the pandemic, many due to a lack of\nprotection.\n\nHowever, a committee advising the CDC appears poised to brush aside the\nupdated science when it comes to its pending guidance on health care\nfacilities.\n\nLisa Brosseau, an aerosol expert and a consultant at the Center for Infectious\nDisease Research and Policy in Minnesota, warns of a repeat of 2020 if that\nhappens.\n\n\u201cThe rubber hits the road when you make decisions on how to protect people,\u201d\nBrosseau said. \u201cAerosol scientists may see this report as a big win because\nthey think everything will now follow from the science. But that\u2019s not how\nthis works and there are still major barriers.\u201d\n\n### Recommended\n\nHealth news\n\n### Health newsUSDA to test ground beef in states with outbreaks of bird flu\nin dairy cows\n\nHealth news\n\n### Health newsFDA brings lab tests under federal oversight in bid to improve\naccuracy and safety\n\nMoney is one. If a respiratory disease spreads through inhalation, it means\nthat people can lower their risk of infection indoors through sometimes costly\nmethods to clean the air, such as mechanical ventilation and using air\npurifiers, and wearing an N95 mask. The CDC has so far been reluctant to press\nfor such measures, as it updates foundational guidelines on curbing airborne\ninfections in hospitals, nursing homes, prisons, and other facilities that\nprovide health care. This year, a committee advising the CDC released a draft\nguidance that differs significantly from the WHO report.\n\nWhereas the WHO report doesn\u2019t characterize airborne viruses and bacteria as\ntraveling short distances or long, the CDC draft maintains those traditional\ncategories. It prescribes looser-fitting surgical masks rather than N95s for\npathogens that \u201cspread predominantly over short distances.\u201d Surgical masks\nblock far fewer airborne virus particles than N95s, which cost roughly 10\ntimes as much.\n\nResearchers and health care workers have been outraged about the committee\u2019s\ndraft, filing letters and petitions to the CDC. They say it gets the science\nwrong and endangers health. \u201cA separation between short- and long-range\ndistance is totally artificial,\u201d Tang said.\n\nAirborne viruses travel much like cigarette smoke, he explained. The scent\nwill be strongest beside a smoker, but those farther away will inhale more and\nmore smoke if they remain in the room, especially when there\u2019s no ventilation.\n\nLikewise, people open windows when they burn toast so that smoke dissipates\nbefore filling the kitchen and setting off an alarm. \u201cYou think viruses stop\nafter 3 feet and drop to the ground?\u201d Tang said of the classical notion of\ndistance. \u201cThat is absurd.\u201d\n\nThe CDC\u2019s advisory committee is comprised primarily of infection control\nresearchers at large hospital systems, while the WHO consulted a diverse group\nof scientists looking at many different types of studies. For example, one\nanalysis examined the puff clouds expelled by singers, and musicians playing\nclarinets, French horns, saxophones, and trumpets. Another reviewed 16\ninvestigations into Covid outbreaks at restaurants, a gym, a food processing\nfactory, and other venues, finding that insufficient ventilation probably made\nthem worse than they would otherwise be.\n\nIn response to the outcry, the CDC returned the draft to its committee for\nreview, asking it to reconsider its advice. Meetings from an expanded working\ngroup have since been held privately. But the National Nurses United union\nobtained notes of the conversations through a public records request to the\nagency. The records suggest a push for more lax protection. \u201cIt may be\ndifficult as far as compliance is concerned to not have surgical masks as an\noption,\u201d said one unidentified member, according to notes from the committee\u2019s\nMarch 14 discussion. Another warned that \u201csupply and compliance would be\ndifficult.\u201d\n\nThe nurses\u2019 union, far from echoing such concerns, wrote on its website, \u201cThe\nWork Group has prioritized employer costs and profits (often under the\numbrella of \u2018feasibility\u2019 and \u2018flexibility\u2019) over robust protections.\u201d Jane\nThomason, the union\u2019s lead industrial hygienist, said the meeting records\nsuggest the CDC group is working backward, molding its definitions of airborne\ntransmission to fit the outcome it prefers.\n\nTang expects resistance to the WHO report. \u201cInfection control people who have\nbuilt their careers on this will object,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes a long time to\nchange people\u2019s way of thinking.\u201d\n\nThe CDC declined to comment on how the WHO\u2019s shift might influence its final\npolicies on infection control in health facilities, which might not be\ncompleted this year. Creating policies to protect people from inhaling\nairborne viruses is complicated by the number of factors that influence how\nthey spread indoors, such as ventilation, temperature, and the size of the\nspace.\n\nAdding to the complexity, policymakers must weigh the toll of various\nailments, ranging from Covid to colds to tuberculosis, against the burden of\nprotection. And tolls often depend on context, such as whether an outbreak\nhappens in a school or a cancer ward.\n\n\u201cWhat is the level of mortality that people will accept without precautions?\u201d\nTang said. \u201cThat\u2019s another question.\u201d\n\nAmy Maxmen | KFF Health News\n\nAmy Maxmen | KFF Health News\n\n\u00a9 2024 NBC UNIVERSAL\n\nWe and our partners use cookies on this site to improve our service, perform\nanalytics, personalize advertising, measure advertising performance, and\nremember website preferences.
