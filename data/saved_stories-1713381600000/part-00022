However, what we don\u2019t hear enough about is alcohol\nand how deadly it is. Alcohol is the most socially acceptable drug on the\nmarket and the most easily accessible. Even with this knowledge, the general\npublic still has a tendency to believe alcohol is ok, not dangerous, and an\nacceptable form of relaxation. Science tells us something different. Alcohol\nis the deadliest drug of all. Let\u2019s look at why this is true.\n\n## Alcohol Kills More People Than All Other Drugs Combined.\n\nAlcohol is the third leading preventable cause of death in the US The National\nInstitute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism has reported that alcohol causes\n88,000 deaths each year. Alcohol has shortened the lifespan of those 88,000\nhuman beings by 30 years. All other drugs combined only cause 30,000 deaths a\nyear. Alcohol is not only harmful to the individual, but it\u2019s also harmful to\nsociety as a whole. Its negative effects are wide-ranging and can result in\ninjuries, car accidents, violence, and sexual assault. Even with knowing this,\nalcohol is still more common than other drugs, and alcohol distributors and\nbartenders are not looked at like drug dealers who sell Heroin and Cocaine.\nAlcohol is different than other illicit substances that we know can cause\noverdose deaths because alcohol can also kill people slowly by deteriorating\nthe body.\n\nPaid Advertising.

In comparison, ecstasy was only one eighth as\nharmful as alcohol. This ranking encouraged the scientists to say that\naggressively targeting the harms of alcohol is a necessary public health\nstrategy. They also mentioned that the current drug classifications had little\nto do with the relation to the evidence of harm. Just because Cocaine and\nheroin are illegal doesn\u2019t make them more dangerous. The World Health\nOrganization estimates risks linked to alcohol cause 2.5 million deaths\nworldwide each year from heart and liver disease, road accidents, suicides,\nand cancer. On the scale given by the scientists, alcohol received a score of\n72 out of 100. Heroin received a 55, while crack received a 54.\n\n## Alcohol Is More Easily Accessible Than Most Other Drugs.\n\nEven though it is the deadliest drug, alcohol is legal in the US and Britain,\nas well as many other countries around the world. As we can see from this\nstudy and alcohol\u2019s far-reaching effects, legal substances cause just as much\ndamage, or more, than illegal substances. This might be in part because of how\neasy it is to access alcohol. Most people don\u2019t even call alcohol a drug\nbecause of its acceptance and accessibility in our society. Did you know that\nmore people enter treatment facilities for alcohol misuse than any other drug?\nAccording to Psychology Today, only 50% of Americans drink. Of that 50%, the\nmajority of alcohol is consumed by the top 10 percent. Those heavy drinkers\nconsume about 73 drinks per week. This means that Big Alcohol must sell to\nheavy, problematic drinkers. Their target market is a group of people are sick\nand suffering. This is no different from regular drug dealers who depend on\nconsumers to buy their products.\n\n## Alcohol Directly Causes A Variety Of Diseases.\n\nLast year, we learned that alcohol is the direct cause of 7 forms of cancer.\nEven light to moderate drinkers are at risk. The study, published in the\njournal Addiction, provided evidence that alcohol is the direct cause of\nbreast, liver, colon, esophagus, and other types of cancer. The researchers\nalso mentioned that there is growing evidence, though not conclusive yet, that\nalcohol also causes skin, prostate, and pancreatic cancer. Alcohol also causes\nfatty liver disease, cirrhosis of the liver, and alcohol hepatitis. These\nconditions can kill drinkers slowly and over many years. Heavy drinking can\nweaken the heart and affect how oxygen and nutrients are delivered to certain\norgans in your body. Prolonged and excessive alcohol use can also interfere\nwith brain function and structure. Not to mention the secondhand events that\noccur like car accidents, DUI\u2019s, drunken injuries, toxic relationships, and\ndestruction of property.\n\nThe truth is alcohol is the deadliest drug and the research and statistics\nprove this. In a country that is focusing solely on the current opioid\nepidemic, these facts are a good reminder that alcohol is deadlier and more\nsocially acceptable than other drugs. Next time someone tries to justify\ndrinking alcohol, remember it causes cancer and other diseases, it\u2019s three\ntimes as harmful as cocaine or tobacco, and it causes more deaths than all\nother drugs combined. We shouldn\u2019t just accept alcohol was a part of life; we\nshould talk about just how deadly it is.\n\nLast Updated: November 9, 2023\n\nAuthor\n\nKelly Fitzgerald\n\n  * Kelly Fitzgerald is a sober writer based in Southwest Florida.
