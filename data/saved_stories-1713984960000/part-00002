Gemini Code Assist is a new version of Duet AI with significant\nimprovements. It can process up to 1 million tokens, four times more data than\nAnthropic's Claude 3 model and eight times more than OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo.\nThis means that Code Assist can perform complex tasks such as analyzing code\nlibraries, understanding lengthy documents, and holding more extended\nconversations more easily.\n\nMichael Vakoc and Pramodh Ramesh, both product managers at Google, write:\n\n> Gemini Code Assist understands enterprise context, such as security schemas,\n> API patterns, integrations, etc., and uses it to provide tailored\n> recommendations for your use case. Furthermore, using Gemini Code Assist\n> lets you iterate on your existing API or integration in development instead\n> of prompting from scratch.\n\nWith Gemini Code Assist, API creation in Apigee, a managed API Broker service\nin the Google Cloud, can be easier for developers. If the available API\nspecifications on API Hub don't match developers' needs, Gemini allows them to\ndescribe their requirements in plain language to generate a tailored\nspecification. In addition, Gemini Code Assist provides clear guidance on\nadding new policy configurations during API proxy creation. It explains\nexisting configurations, easing the learning curve for updates and\nmaintenance.\n\nGemini Code Assist provides guidance and explanations during API proxy\ncreation (Source: Google Cloud blog post)\n\nRichard Seroter, chief evangelist at Google Cloud, tweeted:\n\n> Apigee also got the Gemini Code Assist fever. I like this new ability to\n> create and use specs to generate APIs. And it\u2019s cool that it factors in\n> existing API objects.\n\nGoogle\u2019s standalone Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) solution with\nGemini Code Assist allows developers to easily create automation flows by\ndescribing their needs. For instance, they can automate tasks like updating\nCRM cases from newly created issues in bug-tracking systems. Users can issue\nprompts to Gemini or utilize one-click suggestions within the interface.\nDrawing from enterprise contexts such as APIs and applications, Gemini\nproposes tailored flows for the use case. It automatically generates variables\nand pre-configures tasks, readying the integration for immediate use.\n\nExtending integration flows with proactive suggestions from Gemini Code Assist\n(Source: Google Cloud blog post)\n\nIn addition, Gemini responds to prompts, proactively suggests optimizations,\nand facilitates one-click extensions to existing flows, reducing maintenance\nefforts. The visual interface of Application Integration makes the flow self-\nexplanatory, aiding new user onboarding. Additionally, Gemini generates\nintelligent descriptions based on existing configurations.\n\nGemini Code Assist is a competitive offering compared to GitHub Copilot\nEnterprise, and Microsoft has services with embedded AI assistance with\nMicrosoft Copilot. This Copilot is in preview for Azure API Management, an API\nbroker similar to Apigee, and for Logic Apps, comparable to Application\nIntegration.\n\n## About the Author\n\n#### Steef-Jan Wiggers\n\nSteef-Jan Wiggers is one of InfoQ's senior cloud editors and works as an\nIntegration Architect at i8c in The Netherlands.
