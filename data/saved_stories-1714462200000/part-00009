There are various problems with sudo, which basically come down to\nthat it\u2019s a large SUID binary, meaning it consists of privileged code that\nunprivileged users can run from their own context. This makes sudo a fairly\nlarge attack surface, and why OpenBSD uses doas instead; while doas suffers\nfrom the same main problem, it\u2019s much smaller and reduces the attack surface\nconsiderably.\n\n> SUID processes are weird concepts: they are invoked by unprivileged code and\n> inherit the execution context intended and controlled by unprivileged code.\n> By execution context I mean the myriad of properties that a process has on\n> Linux these days, from environment variables, process scheduling properties,\n> cgroup assignments, security contexts, file descriptors passed, and so on\n> and so on. A few of these settings the kernel is nice enough to clean up\n> automatically when a SUID binary is invoked, but much of it has to be\n> cleaned up by the invoked suid binary.

Run0 asks\nthe services manager to create a shell or command under the target user\u2019s ID,\ncreating a new PTY, sending data back and forth from the originating TTY and\nthe new PTY.\n\n> Or in other words: the target command is invoked in an isolated exec\n> context, freshly forked off PID 1, without inheriting any context from the\n> client (well, admittedly, we *do* propagate $TERM, but that\u2019s an explicit\n> exception, i.e. allowlist rather than denylist).\n>\n> One could say, \u201crun0\u201d is closer to behaviour of \u201cssh\u201d than to \u201csudo\u201d, in\n> many ways.

For better or worse, this is what\u2019s happening.\n\nIronically Pottering\u2019s run0 works very similarly to the init system I wrote\nnearly two decades ago for my distro, which my distro called \u201crund\u201d for \u201crun\ndaemon\u201d. Instead of forking privileged processes from the current context,\nthere was a protocol to instruct pid 0 to launch a new process tree. My idea\nwas to be able to support adhoc job execution on a read only file system\nwithout requiring config files in order to create/launch jobs. Being able to\nlaunch adhoc jobs from scripts and/or command line and have them be\nmanipulated as normal jobs was useful in the readonly squashfs environments I\nwas dealing with.\n\nLog in to Reply\n\n     * 2024-04-29 4:46 pm\n\nchriscox\n\nTo \u201cswitch user\u201d require elevated privs. So, while I understand the \u201clogic\u201d\nand the \u201cneed\u201d (perhaps unlike Lennart \u201cthere is no use case\u201d Poettering), the\nfact is, elevation is required.

The combination of the GNU userland, Linux kernel, Wayland\ndisplay server, and systemd init/service supervisor/bootloader/dns\nresolver/syslogger/ntp replacement/device manager/login manager/mount\nmanager/system bus manager/home directory (mis)manager/networking manager/more\nstuff I can\u2019t remember...all of this makes Linux based OSes very much un-UNIX-\nlike.\n\nLinux distros that keep it simple and actually UNIX-like are a dying breed,\nsadly. Slackware, the oldest distro still in active development, is feeling\nmore anachronistic every day. Void is amazing and my first choice for a Linux\nbased OS, but its community is tiny; fiercely dedicated and friendly, but tiny\nnonetheless. Alpine is great but hyper-focused on use in containers and VMs.\nDevuan is, sadly, a parody of itself these days and continuously broken. Crux\nis phenomenal but nearly impossible for a newbie to pick up and run with, it\u2019s\nbarely easier than LFS. Ditto for KISS Linux, its philosophy is sound but you\nhave to be a seasoned Linux user to properly understand and maintain it\nyourself.\n\nLike it or not, Linux on the desktop will soon be a vaguely UNIX-like kernel\nrunning at the core of an incoherent mound of bleeding edge, test it in\nproduction, throw shit at the wall and see what sticks garbage.

There are risks executing\nbinaries under a potentially malicious environment. Obviously these can be\nmitigated by sanitizing the environment so that ideally nothing gets passed\nin. But the problem with suid fork/exec is that the environment gets inherited\nby default. Sanitizing it is left as an exercise for sysadmins & application\ndevelopers. Obviously starting a new clean environment would help mitigate\nhuman errors though.\n\nTo be honest, I think the best solution would be to enforce a new environment\nfor all SUID binaries such that every SUID binary could assume a clean\nenvironment by default. This would also have the advantage of maintaining true\nPPID relationships in the process list (breaking the process hierarchy is a\nshortcoming of the systemd/run0 proposal). As usual though the problem with\nchanging the way old APIs work is that there\u2019s tons of old code that relies on\ncurrent behavior. There is a lot of pressure keep the original behavior around\nno matter the risks.\n\nThis puts the onus on sysadmins/developers to consistently get it right.\nIdeally we always would, but shellshock might serve as a reminder of how even\negregious security oversights can make their way into production systems.\nhttps://metalkey.github.io/shellshock-explained\u2013exploitation-tutorial.html\n\nLog in to Reply\n\n  5. 2024-04-29 2:32 pm\n\ngaryd\n\nMost of the problems with sudo have already been solved by OpenBSD\u2019s\nimplementation of \u201cdoas.\u201d\n\nLog in to Reply\n\n  6. 2024-04-29 3:43 pm\n\nBill Shooter of Bul Platinum Prime\n\nI don\u2019t think he\u2019s wrong in his criticisms of sudo/doas. But I\u2019m not sure if\nhis solution is the right one. Polkit instead of /etc/sudoers? I get the point\nof that, but I\u2019m not a huge fan of Polkit\u2019s configuration. From my limited\nexperience with it, it seems much more complex than /etc/sudoers for simple\ncases. Would love to hear a comparison between them for someone who has more\nexperiences as a real sysadmin than I do. But maybe the solution is to make\npolkit the one true solution for unprivileged processes to speak with\nprivileged ones, to be better and easier to configure. I\u2019ve not had to do\nthat, so I\u2019m woefully ignorant of it for the most part.\n\nLog in to Reply\n\n  7. 2024-04-29 4:45 pm\n\nrainbowsocks\n\nMixed feelings about this. I generally approve of systemd and how it\u2019s unified\nand improved Linux init and services management, but Poettering has a record\nof bringing things under the systemd umbrella that he does not have the\nskillset to write or maintain \u2013 see for instance the history of bugs in\nsystemd-resolvd and systemd-timesyncd. That he\u2019s now bringing in a sudo\nreplacement, i.e. another security-critical piece with highly specific\nrequirements, does not fill me with confidence.\n\nLog in to Reply\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\n### Our Sponsor\n\n### Search OSNEWS\n\n### OSnews Accounts\n\n    * Create Account\n    * Login\n\n### Featured articles\n\n    * Microsoft adds driver to Windows that prevents changing the default browser using the registry\n    * Setting up a YubiKey on Linux is a mess, and it really shouldn\u2019t be\n    * Fedora change proposal suggests switching the main Fedora Workstation release to KDE Plasma\n\n### Topics\n\n### Related Posts\n\n    * An Introduction to Logical Volume Management\n\nMarch 10, 2009 \u2022 8 Comments\n\n    * Linux 2.6.0-test6 Development Kernel\n\nSeptember 28, 2003 \u2022 41 Comments\n\n    * VectorLinux-4.0-rc1 Available\n\nAugust 1, 2003 \u2022 9 Comments\n\n    * To Push Desktop Linux, Radical Shift may be Required\n\nNovember 14, 2003 \u2022 48 Comments\n\n    * Linux Trademark Rejected by Australia\n\nSeptember 16, 2005 \u2022 38 Comments\n\n### Popular Posts\n\n    * Some personal news\n\nMarch 23, 2024 \u2022 69 Comments\n\n    * Linus Torvalds really prefers tabs\n\nApril 17, 2024 \u2022 64 Comments\n\n    * VMS Software guts its community licensing program\n\nApril 13, 2024 \u2022 50 Comments\n\n    * Microsoft adds driver to Windows that prevents changing the default browser using the registry\n\nApril 8, 2024 \u2022 46 Comments\n\n    * Hackintosh is (almost) dead\n\nMarch 17, 2024 \u2022 28 Comments\n\n### Popular Posts (Last 3 Years)\n\n    * Apple\u2019s new M1 Pro and M1 Max processors take its in-house Arm-based chips to new heights\n\nOctober 18, 2021\n\n    * Microsoft is testing a desktop watermark for unsupported Windows 11 PCs\n\nFebruary 27, 2022\n\n    * Rant: year of Linux on the desktop\n\nDecember 29, 2022\n\n    * A few thoughts on Fuchsia security\n\nJune 14, 2021\n\n    * Apple intentionally kills web applications for EU users in iOS 17.4 onward to spite its EU users\n\nFebruary 15, 2024\n\n### About OSnews\n\nOSnews Privacy Statement \u00a9 OSnews Inc.

I was made aware\nby several people, including a mention in Slime Mold Time Mold\u2019s latest\nmonthly link post.\n\nFirst, let me say that I don\u2019t mean anything in this post to come across as\nmean. I\u2019m just kind of a dick sometimes, and if this post comes across\ndickish, that\u2019s why.\n\nAuthor, pictured reading Thoughts on seed oil\n\n##\n\nSmartest Guy in the Room Syndrome\n\nYou might recall my post Seed Oils explain the 8 Mysteries of Obesity. This\npost is of a similar nature as Slime Mold Time Mold\u2019s critique of seed oil\ntheory, A bad seed. My impression is that somebody sat down and read a bunch\nof seed oil stuff, but that there isn\u2019t a deeper level of understanding.\n\nSomebody who isn\u2019t knee deep into a complex topic like Modern PUFA Theory\n(MPT) will of course miss things. And not everybody is deep into MPT. Not\neverybody needs to, some people need to do plumbing and make chairs and stuff.\nWe can\u2019t all be professional seed oil disrespecters.\n\nThe issue with articles like this: they basically always default to the status\nquo of mainstream nutrition. There\u2019s a bunch of both-sides\u2019ing going on, and\nthen there\u2019s an Appeal to The Status Quo. The subtitle of Dynomight\u2019s post is\n\u201cDon\u2019t get distracted.\u201d\n\nSeed oils are apparently a distraction. Distraction from what?\n\n> My real worry about seed oil theory is that it\u2019s a distraction. If you want\n> to be healthier, we know ways you can change your diet that will help:\n> Increase your overall diet \u201cquality\u201d. Eat lots of fruits and vegetables.\n> Avoid processed food. Especially avoid processed meats. Eat food with low\n> caloric density. Avoid added sugar. Avoid alcohol. Avoid processed food.\n>\n> I know this is hard. You could even argue it\u2019s unrealistic. That wouldn\u2019t\n> make it wrong.\n\nSee? We already KNOW what causes obesity! Eat a \u201cquality\u201d diet (define\nquality). Eat fruits and vegetables. Avoid processed food & especially meats.\nEat low caloric density. Blah blah blah.\n\nIn short, seed oils are a distraction from the retarded1 status quo that has\nbeen failing for 50 years.\n\nThe \u201cappeal to it\u2019s hard\u201d is especially annoying. We KNOW how to lose weight,\nit\u2019s just that EVERYBODY IS A FUCKING LAZY SLOB AND DOESN\u2019T WANT TO EAT FRUITS\n& VEGETABLES.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest, that\u2019s what the takeaway is: fuck fat people.\n\nOf course we know that vegetables & low caloric density are horseshit when it\ncomes to reversing obesity.\n\nSee what I mean about being a dick?\n\n##\n\nThis article is a distraction from learning more\n\nWhat intrigued me most about Slime Mold Time Mold\u2019s excellent series A\nChemical Hunger was mostly the sense of curiosity. They were asking tough\nquestions.\n\nThey had some ideas. Hey, maybe it\u2019s lithium? Or magical potato juice? Or\nliving in the mountains?\n\nBut mostly, they just pointed out the uncomfortable truth:\n\nWe\u2019ve spent 50+ years studying nutrition and we\u2019re SIGNIFICANTLY worse off\nthan when we started.\n\nAny article that insists we know how to reverse obesity, and if fat people\ncould just EAT THEIR GODDAMN VEGETABLES ONCE IN A WHILE, and then reasons back\nfrom there - let\u2019s just say I\u2019m less than impressed.\n\nModern nutrition is not a court of law. Seed oils are not innocent until\nproven guilty.\n\nWe\u2019re not in 12 Angry Men, sitting calmly around a table and discussing the\nfine details of a young man being railroaded for a crime he probably didn\u2019t\ncommit.\n\nWe\u2019re in the middle of Scream: somebody\u2019s made 12% of Americans diabetic, 43%\nobese, 72% overweight. And the trend is continuing: we wake up every year to\nmore of the same. Scientists estimate 100% of Americans will look like those\npeople from Wall-E by next Thursday.\n\nWe can totally debate who did it and who was innocent and stuff once we\u2019ve\nstopped the killing.\n\nUntil then, everyone in the movie is a suspect unless they get stabbed. (And\neven that might just be a plot twist.)\n\nWhat does that mean in diet terms? Cut out as many obesogenic suspects as\npossible until we see a drastic reversal of obesity.\n\nAnd seed oils are clearly the #1 suspect.\n\n##\n\nMaybe it\u2019s not Seed Oils\n\nI am very open to the idea that it\u2019s not seed oils. At the very least, we\nalready know that it\u2019s not JUST seed oils, there are some factors that are at\nthe very least downstream from seed oils: excess protein (for some people).\nBCAA/glycine balance. Swamping your macros (mixing carbs & fat). Insulin.\nMaybe fructose (for some people).\n\nMaybe some of these factors are at play even in absence of seed oils. Maybe it\nwas lithium this whole time. Maybe it\u2019s another character who hasn\u2019t been\nintroduced yet. This isn\u2019t a movie - we\u2019re not guaranteed that the killer is\none of the highschool kids.\n\nBut let\u2019s at least look. I\u2019m very interested in alternative explanations for\nthe obesity epidemic, like Vitamin A Theory, Lithium, Magic Potato Theory, ..\n\nWhat I don\u2019t find particularly convincing is \u201cWe already know, everybody is\njust really too lazy to do the Hard Work of Eating Fruits &\nVegetarbles\u201d-theory.\n\nIssues with Modern PUFA Theory\n\nThe Dynomight post brings up several common critiques of MPT:\n\n  1. It\u2019s complex\n\n  2. It\u2019s difficult to disprove\n\n  3. There are many variations/aspects to it\n\n  4. Not all proponents agree\n\n  5. Public health authorities say saturated fat is bad \ud83e\udd23 (I\u2019m not kidding)\n\nTo quote Dynomight:\n\n> That wouldn\u2019t make it wrong.\n\nLet\u2019s address these one by one. Except that last one, that\u2019s just retarded2.\n\n##\n\nModern PUFA Theory is Complex\n\nYou know, not like the mainstream Energy Balance Model:\n\nThis is from a paper by Kevin Hall, the final boss & root cause of the\ndiabesity epidemic: The energy balance model of obesity: beyond calories in,\ncalories out.\n\nRemember to take your statins, Kevin. For science.\n\nThe main feature of the EBM is, of course, a level of complexity so deep that\nit is impossible to describe or falsify.\n\nThe obvious purpose: hide the fact that modern nutrition science has no effing\nclue as to what causes obesity, or how to reverse it.\n\nTo take a step back: we know that the cause & solution of the obesity epidemic\nwould be somewhat complex. Heck, we\u2019ve been working on it for 50+ years. If it\nwas really trivial, like \u201ceat fruits & vegetables,\u201d somebody would\u2019ve figured\nit out by now. We wouldn\u2019t need autistic jerks on the internet running diet\ntrials.\n\n##\n\nModern PUFA Theory is Difficult to Disprove\n\nComplex hypotheses are difficult to disprove.\n\nThe main reasons why MPT is difficult to disprove are as follows:\n\n  1. Linoleic acid gets incorporated into cells, with turn over from days to years\n\n  2. Linoleic acid gets stored in adipose tissue, with a half-life of 680 days\n\n  3. Linoleic acid doesn\u2019t necessarily have a linear obesogenic effect; there seems to be a threshold between 2-8%\n\n  4. Linoleic acid is omnipresent in the Western Diet\n\n  5. Seed oils are used in animal feeds, and make their way into most animal fats like chicken (#1 source of LA in America) & lard\n\nThe combination of these facts means that you can\u2019t simply run an RCT for 30\ndays, give one group a muffin with soybean oil, and the other a muffin with\nanother fat, and compare the results.\n\nEverybody in the west is constantly bathed in seed oils, and has been their\nentire lives. So you\u2019d need to de-PUFA them first. This would take years.\n\nIn addition, you can\u2019t just avoid literal \u201cseed oils\u201d since the monogastric\nanimals who were fed seed oils now also contain a high level of linoleic acid.\nSo to \u201cavoid seed oils\u201d you really also need to avoid almost all fatty pork\n(e.g. bacon), fatty chicken. Heck, nuts are very high in linoleic acid\nnaturally.\n\nYou see this comparison in \u201cstudies disproving seed oils\u201d a lot: they use lard\nas the saturated fat, contrasting it with a seed oil. But commercial U.S. lard\nhas been shown to be 20-30% linoleic acid, like a medium-bad seed oil. A\nsingle strip of thick-cut bacon is probably enough to put you over the safe\ndaily limit.\n\nShould you really want to demonstrate something about saturated fats, you\nwould have to use beef tallow, preferably from suet, butter, or cocoa fat.\n\nTo really, really disprove MPT, you would have to do the following:\n\n  1. Put a group of people on a <2% linoleic acid diet\n\n  2. Keep them there for a 4-8 year washout period, until their adipose LA drops to <2%\n\n  3. Now run the experiment\n\n  4. You probably have to run it for at least several months\n\nIs that difficult? Sure is. But:\n\n> That wouldn\u2019t make it wrong.\n\nWe know the correct explanation will be more complex than \u201ceat vegetables\u201d, or\nwe would\u2019ve solved it in 1950. Or whenever vegetables were invented.\n\n##\n\nThere are many Variations of PUFA Theory & not all Proponents Agree\n\nThis is true, but it is also true for all theories.\n\nNo serious nutrition scientist believes in naive CICO. - A serious nutrition\nscientist\n\nCICO is a law of thermodynamics. Are you saying physics isn\u2019t real?! - Every\nCICOpath bro on Twitter\n\nAs somebody who battles CICOpaths on Twitter daily, I get attacked from both\nsides. CICO is clearly a strawman, an idea so stupid & so simple that it\u2019s\nunbelievable I\u2019d ascribe it to anybody.\n\nOn the other hand, CICO is literally a law of physics, and even dreaming of\ncriticizing it shows that I\u2019m an idiot who doesn\u2019t believe in science.\n\nI\u2019d say that the seed oil camp isn\u2019t quite as split.\n\nFrom where I stand, I see the following factions:\n\n  1. LA oxidation products are bad\n\n  2. Oxidizing LA in the mitochondria is bad\n\n  3. An out-of-whack balance of omega-6 (LA) to omega-3 (fish oil) PUFAs is bad\n\n  4. All double bonds (and therefore PUFAs, incl. omega-3) are bad\n\nThere is some overlap with of these. For example, I personally believe all of\nthem are true to a degree, or on the margin, or in the right context.\n\nNumber 1 is hard to deny, but you could retreat to \u201cok, don\u2019t eat deep-fried\nfoods\u201d and downplay how much of this is actually happening, or what part of\nthe diabesity epidemic this is at the root of.\n\nNumber 2 is pretty unknown outside of Hyperlipid/Fire in a Bottle. If you\nexplain it do laymen, their eyes will glaze over because you need to give them\nan hour of biochem background they\u2019ve never heard of.\n\nNumber 3 is pretty mainstream. (And IMO the weakest one.)\n\nNumber 4 is maybe the biggest split among the seed oil camp, because it\ndirectly contradicts Number 3 (balance) and shits on everybody\u2019s favorite\nhealth food: \u201coily fish rich in polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids.\u201d\n\n##\n\nSeed Oils: The Mecha-Godzilla in the Room\n\nPictured: 4-HNE, an oxidation product of linoleic acid, wreaking havoc on you\n\nPeople like to shit on \u201cmechanistic speculation\u201d but if you don\u2019t have a\nmechanism, you don\u2019t understand it. If you\u2019re gonna convict somebody of\nmurder, you better have an idea of how he did it. It\u2019s certainly not enough to\nprove seed oils are guilty, but then it\u2019s not the only thing we have.\n\nImagine I invented a new drug, and I call it UPFA. UPFA is quite potent:\n\n  1. It seems to decrease metabolic rate\n\n  2. It triggers the endocannabinoid system, giving people uncontrollable cravings\n\n  3. It will get incorporated into your cells and mitochondria, causing dysfunction in whatever the cell is doing\n\n  4. It oxidizes at room temperature and even more so human body temperature\n\n  5. It\u2019s intended use is for cooking (aka heating)\n\n  6. It will get incorporated into your adipose tissue, therefore sticking around for years even after you stop using it\n\n  7. If we use it for deep frying, which we do, up to 25% of its total mass (!) oxidizes into toxic aldehydes and other carcinogens within days to weeks\n\n  8. It gets incorporated into LDL, which we think is suspiciously lurking around heart disease a lot. And we actually think that oxidized LDL is the culprit, and literally measure oxLDL as a CVD proxy.\n\n  9. It happily turns into trans-fat AT ROOM TEMPERATURE, which we DEFINITELY think are super dangerous and carcinogenic and are literally banned. In fact, over 90% of UPFA sold contains trans-fats at unsafe levels.\n\nShould the FDA approve UPFA for 25% of our total calories?\n\n##\n\nThere is no Upside to Seed Oils. Avoiding them is FREE!\n\nI would understand a position like this:\n\n> Hey, seed oils are in all the processed food, and they\u2019re used in deep\n> frying, which we know to be terribly unhealthy. We also know they have\n> terrible oxidation products, and they oxidize much more quickly than other\n> fats.\n>\n> In addition, nobody really uses seed oils for their great taste or culinary\n> excellence. They\u2019re just the cheapest fats we have.\n>\n> Nobody\u2019s ever said \u201cWow, I really love the flavor of that soybean oil, is\n> that imported from the Soy region of Italy?\u201d\n>\n> They\u2019re also known to easily turn into trans fats when heated, and 90%+ of\n> seed oils sold contain significant amounts of trans fats.\n>\n> And seed oils are also the most recent category of industrial, man-made\n> foods added to our food supply: we\u2019ve had refined wheat & sugar forever, but\n> seed oils were only invented in 1865.

But that\u2019s only in mice.\n>\n> Anecdotally, many people who remove seed oils from their diets aggressively\n> see unbelievable benefits.

Apparently we need a written confession from seed\noils that they deliberately planned the obesity epidemic, a detailed plan of\naction, and notarized receipts.\n\nUntil then, I guess we should just sit down and eat vegetables.\n\n##\n\nSome comments on the post directly\n\nMost of this has just been a more generic critique (=sparkling water-fueled\nrant) of the attitude or general category of thought.\n\nBut let me also comment on some of the specific things said. This is probably\none of the more \u201cconstructive\u201d parts of this missive.\n\nDefinitely maybe\n\nDynomight writes on mechanisms:\n\n> Our last argument is that we know how seed oils hurt you. People seem to\n> suggest five possible mechanisms:\n>\n>   1. Maybe linoleic acid (common in seed oils) is metabolized into\n> arachidonic acid, and thereby causes inflammation.\n>\n>   2. Maybe linoleic acid becomes oxidized LDL and thereby causes\n> inflammation.\n>\n>   3. Maybe it\u2019s the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats you eat that matters.\n>\n>   4. Maybe vegetable oil doesn\u2019t make you feel full like animal fats do,\n> meaning vegetable oils lead to overeating.\n>\n>   5. Maybe vegetable oils have an increased propensity to become trans fats.\n>\n>\n\nMaybe?\n\nPretty much all of these are just facts, not \u201cmaybes.\u201d You could argue that\nthe way the sentences are formulated lets you slip in a shadow of doubt.\n\nE.g. \u201cOJ Simpson was a football player & a movie star & killed his wife.\u201d\n\nYes, that compound statement is maybe not proven in a court of law, but\nthere\u2019s no doubt about the first 2 fragments.\n\nSimilarly, we KNOW LA metabolizes into AA. All the steps of linoleic acid\nmetabolism are well-documented.\n\nWe know PUFAs oxidize more readily, at lower temperatures, more rapidly, than\nMUFAs or SFAs. That\u2019s just chemistry.\n\nWe know that the omega-3:omega-6 ratio in cell phospholipids has a pretty huge\nimpact on the cell\u2019s functioning, that\u2019s quite a mainstream view.\n\nWe know PUFAs more readily oxidize into trans fats than any other fats, and\nthat seed oils (and animal fats from monogastric animals fed seed oils) are\nmuch higher in PUFAs than most traditional fats used for cooking.\n\nThe only quibble is about the definition of inflammation, and for 4. if you\nbelieve in Hyperlipid\u2019s ROS theory.\n\nA monster lives in your garage\n\n> All of these things are possible. Maybe an invisible dragon really does live\n> in your garage. But the more such features a theory has, the less I trust\n> it.\n\nThe thing is that the existence of a monster in your garage is not up for\ndebate. It\u2019s given 12% of Americans people who enter the garage diabetes, made\n43% obese, and 72% overweight.\n\nWe\u2019re just trying to find out if it\u2019s an invisible dragon, or an invisible\nlandshark, or an invisible madman with a machete.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that something fishy is going on in that garage. If your\nhypothesis is \u201cmaybe you don\u2019t have a diabesity epidemic in your garage,\u201d have\nI got news for you..\n\nTimelines\n\n> True, seed oil consumption has skyrocketed along with obesity. But hold on.\n> If seed oil consumption is causing obesity, then people should have started\n> getting fat after seed oils started increasing. Did they?\n>\n> How early would obesity have to have started increasing to falsify the idea\n> that it\u2019s caused by seed/vegetable oil? 1970? 1940? Earlier?\n\nYes, earlier. In the west, 1768. That\u2019s when seed oils were invented in their\nmodern, industrial incarnation. I\u2019m not sure why all seed oil defenders get\nthis so wrong.\n\nAmerican dairy producers urged Congress to intervene against adulteration of\nbutter with seed oils in 1880. Seed-oil based margarine had apparently taken\nover 1/5th of the entire butter market already.\n\nHalf of all American-made lard was estimated to contain seed oils by 1888.\nThat\u2019s on top of the linoleic acid from pig feed that would already be present\nin the lard. We\u2019re talking added seed oils.\n\nIn 1890, the Canadian government investigated this adulterated, unseemly &\nsoft American lard.\n\nNow people have managed to get diabetes or become obese before 1768, but it\nwas exceedingly rare. But, technically, we knew that the ancient egyptians\nproduced & consumed seed oils, although it was probably just the rich pharaos,\nwhich is why they got heart diseased mummies.\n\nThe timeline is best explained by Tucker Goodrich in this most excellent blog\npost.\n\nInter-country obesity\n\nIf you compare countries by obesity rates and seed oil consumption, it\u2019s not\nthe most obvious correlation.\n\nThis is where MPT is, unfortunately, a little bit complex. But we knew that it\nwould have to be complex to explain reality, and there\u2019s no less complex\nhypothesis out there that fits the data.\n\nIndependent of what you think causes obesity, it\u2019s obvious that genetics plays\nSOME role. I\u2019d say it predetermines how liable you are to get obese from\ncertain environmental/dietary factors.\n\nFor example it\u2019s no surprise that East Asians put on less fat on average. They\neven use a different BMI scale.\n\nOn the other hand, they\u2019re just as likely, maybe more, to get diabetic. I\nexplored this in my post Diabetes vs. Obesity.\n\nIn short, the Chinese are significantly leaner than Americans, but they are\njust as diabetic.\n\nThis is probably just a different phenotype. Some people even think that\nobesity is a protective mechanism against things like diabetes. I\u2019m not sure\nthat\u2019s true, but if we broaden our view from just obesity to \u201cmetabolic\nissues\u201d like obesity OR diabetes, we already get a much better picture.\n\nBut still, let\u2019s take a look at the data. The Dynomight post contains this\ngraphic:\n\nOk, not exactly strung up on the 45\u00b0 line, but it vaguely looks like an up-\nand-to-the-right trend to me. Unfortunately, no regression is shown.\n\nLuckily, the source is provided. (I reused my old obesity data from the\nObesity vs. Diabetes post, so my obesity levels might be slightly different.)\n\nOk, it does go up for sure, if only slightly. Weird how those super obese\ncountries at the bottom right seem to have near-zero omega-6 consumption. Kind\nof hard to believe, if I\u2019m honest. Not sure if that data was collected\ncorrectly.\n\nLet\u2019s exclude them just for fun. Begone, Micronesia and Polynesia!\n\nGoes up even more. Maybe this isn\u2019t \u201cbeyond the shadow of a doubt\u201d obvious,\nbut it sure looks like a positive relationship? It certainly doesn\u2019t seem like\na point against.\n\nAnd, just because the individual continents were actually interesting for\nDiabetes vs. Obesity, let\u2019s do those real quick.\n\nAfrica, check:\n\nAsia, check:\n\nEurope, kinda meh but not negative either:\n\nNorth America, slightly negative.\n\nHuh, Bahamas eats nearly no omega-6? Hard to believe, they are like 3 miles\noff the coast of Florida. Just the seed oil fumes would do it. Just for\nfunsies, let\u2019s exclude them:\n\nOceania w/ suspicious outliers Micronesia/Polynesia:\n\nAnd without. Yea buddy!\n\nSouth America, yup:\n\nSo while it\u2019s not a perfect 45\u00b0 line every time, it sure as heck doesn\u2019t seem\nlike a major point against.\n\nHave I excluded arbitrary and random things I didn\u2019t like on no basis\nwhatsoever? Sure, a few times. But just to show that these things jump around\nlike crazy, based on a few small adjustments to the data. I\u2019m sure you could\ngroup the data to show anything you wanted here.\n\nOverall I don\u2019t think this is a particular strong piece of epidemiology either\nway. The data\u2019s just way too unreliable. We know that the American USDA is\nwrong, after decades, about the linoleic acid content of lard. Most\nmanufacturer macros/numbers and estimates are based on the USDA data,\nincluding probably this data. For example, I\u2019ve heard numbers like 25% of U.S.\ncalories from seed oils, not 7%.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s use Dynomight\u2019s own graph from earlier:\n\nPeople (from 2000-2010) seem to have about 80lbs of vegetable-based oils\n\u201cavailable\u201d to them.\n\n> (80lbs * 454g/lb * 9kcal/g) / 365 days\n>\n> 895.56 kcal/day\n\nOk, maybe \u201cavailable\u201d doesn\u2019t mean consumed. But let\u2019s also remember these\npeople had, on average, 24% linoleic acid in their body fat. So it\u2019s not like\nthey poured all that \u201cavailable\u201d seed oil down the drain.\n\nHow many of the other 190 or so countries in the world, you think, have better\ndata?\n\n##\n\nWhat would convince me to jump ship?\n\nIf you showed me a better hypothesis than Modern PUFA theory, I\u2019d be happy to\nbuy into it. But that\u2019s a pretty high bar. The hypothesis would have to\nexplain:\n\n  1. A steady, growing trend in obesity, diabetes, and heart disease starting around 1850-1880, continuing today, with still massive increases in the last decade\n\n  2. How some people can\u2019t seem to ever get satiated, get morbidly obese, and then, with minor dietary hacks (potato diet, ex150 cream diet), effortlessly lose 50-100lbs without ever going hungry\n\n  3. Mechanisms more severe than carcinogenic & endocannabinoid-stimulating oxidative byproducts at room/body temperature\n\n  4. At least as good epidemiology or better than MPT\n\n  5. That this new factor X is present in nearly all ultra-processed foods\n\n  6. How this new factor X magically transforms the healthy, wholesome potato into the most evil of ultra-processed junk foods, fries & potato chips, with just 1 simple trick (hint: WHAT WAS IT FRIED IN?)\n\nThere\u2019s a saying that describes mainstream nutrition well:\n\nIt is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends\nupon his not understanding it.\n\nOn the other hand, I\u2019d describe my position like this:\n\nIt is difficult to get a man to disregard something when he has effortlessly\nlost 75lbs doing it, without going hungry for a single day.\n\nEspecially when the proposed alternative is literally as retarded3 as \u201ceat\nfruits & vegetables & low caloric density.\"\n\nC\u2019mon, man. Do better. At least use handwavey, unfalsifiable terms like\n\u201cbrain\u201d and \u201csatiety signaling\u201d and \u201cghrelin-leptin resistance.\u201d\n\nAlso, sorry, I don\u2019t mean no disrespect, it\u2019s just that I\u2019m a dick and I get\noffended when people talk nonsense about nutrition/obesity.\n\n1\n\nRetarded means slow\n\n2\n\nRetarded means slow.\n\n3\n\nRetarded means slow.\n\n16 Likes\n\n16\n\nShare this post\n\n#### A reply to Dynomight's \"Thoughts on seed oil\"\n\nwww.exfatloss.com\n\n30\n\nShare\n\n30 Comments\n\nshlomo alonshlomo\u2019s Substack9 hrs agoLiked by Experimental Fat LossYour diet\nisn\u2019t evidence for seed oil hypothesis.1\\.

Maybe one\nreason why some people get more fat than other is that they like eating more\nfor some reason/derive more pleasure from eating, and with modern food the\npleasure ceiling is higher?Maybe like carnivore it kind of works as an\nelimination diet and you get used to your main food and avoid lots of\nmicroinflammation and stuff like that?

[short]\n\nwww.thonking.ai\n\n1\n\nShare\n\nIt\u2019s 2022. I check out this cool new project, CUTLASS, with very fast matmuls.\nI take a large matmul, 8192 x 8192 x 8192, and benchmark it in PyTorch, which\ncalls CuBLAS.\n\n    \n    \n    python mm_bench.py > CuBLAS: 258 Teraflops\n\nNot bad, 83% flop utilization. Now let\u2019s check out Cutlass\u2019s performance using\ntheir profiler.\n\n    \n    \n    ./cutlass_profiler --operation=Gemm --m=8192 --n=8192 --k=8192 > CUTLASS: 288 Teraflops\n\n!!! 10% higher perf? That\u2019s incredible. CuBLAS is highly optimized for large\ncompute-bound matmuls, and somehow CUTLASS + autotuning is outperforming it by\n10%? We gotta start using these matmuls yesterday.\n\nThe next step is to bind the CUTLASS kernels into Python and compare against\nCuBLAS using my previous script.\n\n    \n    \n    python cutlass_mm_bench.py > CuBLAS: 258 Teraflops > CUTLASS: 257 Teraflops\n\nSomehow, in the light of Python, all of CUTLASS\u2019s performance gains disappear.\nThis in of itself is not shocking - it\u2019s notoriously difficult to ensure\nconsistent benchmarking across setups.\n\nI tediously ablate the two benchmark scripts, until finally, I find that\nCUTLASS\u2019s profiler, by default, actually initializes the values in a fairly\nstrange way - it only initializes the inputs with integers. Confused about\nwhether this matters, I try:\n\n    \n    \n    zero_inputs = torch.zeros(N, N) randn_inputs = torch.randn(N, N) benchmark(zero_inputs) # 295 Teraflops benchmark(randn_inputs) # 257 Teraflops\n\nWhat? How could the values of the matrix affect the runtime of the model? I\nknow Nvidia has some weird data compression thing on A100s, but I wouldn\u2019t\nhave expected that to be on in matmuls. Let\u2019s try some other data\ndistributions, like an uniform distribution [0,1].\n\nThis was ... confusing, to say the least. Somehow, the actual content of the\ntensors being multiplied is leading to different matmul performance.\n\nThere certainly are cases where the runtime depends on the content of the\ntensor \u2014 indirect indexing (e.g. A[b]), or things like sparsity.\n\nBut matrix multiplications have nothing like that at all! No matter what the\ncontents of the matrix contain, the matrix multiplication kernel will 1.\nperform the same number of computations, 2. perform the same computations in\nthe same order, 3. access the same memory addresses, and 4. access the same\nmemory addresses in the same order.\n\nNowhere did my mental model of matrix multiplications and GPU hardware allow\nfor the values in the matrix to influence matmul performance. And yet, here we\nare.\n\nAs it turns out, the culprit is ....... dynamic/switching power in\nsemiconductors!\n\nThonk From First Principles is a reader-supported publication. To receive new\nposts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\n#\n\nPower Usage in Semiconductors\n\nAn Nvidia A100 GPU has a power limit of 400W1. However, as the phrase \u201cpower\nlimit\u201d may hint, the GPU doesn\u2019t always use all 400W. For example, when the\nGPU is fully idle, nvidia-smi tells me that it\u2019s only pulling 88W of power.\n\nBut when the GPU is running under load, that power usage will spike\nconsiderably, typically to around the power limit.\n\nIn order to stay under the power limit, a piece on the chip called the Voltage\nRegular Module reduces the voltage supplied to the GPU, \u2014 throttling the clock\nfrequency and reducing its performance.\n\nIn other words, if our GPU ends up using enough power to hit the power limit,\nour performance will become capped.\n\nMost of us take it for granted that \u201cGPU does something, power consumption\ngoes up\u201d. But there are actually two distinct mechanisms through which power\ngets consumed.\n\nDynamic/switching power on the left, static/leakage power on the right. Taken\nfrom https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/low-power/low-power-\ndesign/power-consumption/\n\nThe first one is static/leakage power. You can think of this as the power that\ninevitably gets lost by just flowing power through your circuits. The amount\nof static power used is proportional the amount of silicon that is powered. As\nGPUs don\u2019t do much power gating, this is essentially the amount of power used\nat idle (88W in the above photo).\n\nHowever, the second one, dynamic (or switching) power, is the culprit.\nSpecifically, a small amount of power is consumed whenever a transistor\nswitches states. If the transistor never needs to switch states, it doesn\u2019t\nconsume any extra power. On the other hand, if it\u2019s rapidly flipping, then it\nconsumes a ton of dynamic/switching power. Multiply that by the billions of\ntransistors in your GPU, and you get the overall increase in power\nconsumption.\n\nIn other words, the reason why matrix multiplications are faster when passed\nzeros is that this reduces the \u201cflipping\u201d of enough transistors in the chip to\nstay under the power limit!\n\nSo, this (mostly) explains what we saw previously2. All zeros are probably the\nfastest since every single bit of each computation is a zero and the\naccumulator remains at zero. All ones is probably still quite fast since every\nsingle tensor-core instruction results in exactly the same values. The uniform\ndistribution probably is a little bit faster than the normal distribution\nsince the accumulator never needs to flip-flop between positive and negative.\nThe normal distribution probably has the worst performance since it leads to\npretty high randomness among all transistors involved in the computation(?).\n\nHere\u2019s the results on a number of fun distributions I tried:\n\n  1. Randn: Normally distributed\n\n  2. Checkerboard: Normal distribution, but we have zeros in a checkerboard shape.\n\n  3. Rand: Uniform distribution\n\n  4. Sparse: Normal distribution, but a (random) 75% of the elements are masked.\n\n  5. Ternary: Every value is 1, -1, or 0.\n\n  6. One Bit: Only one bit set in every single value (the 4th bit)\n\n  7. All Pies: Every single value is the mathematical constant PI.\n\n  8. Twos: Every value in the matrices are 2\n\n  9. Zeros: Every value in the matrices are 0\n\nWho says unstructured sparsity isn\u2019t efficient with tensor-cores? :)\n\n#\n\nHow power limit and clock speed affects this\n\nHere\u2019s another piece of evidence that dynamic/switching power is responsible.\n\nRoughly, the power we\u2019re using is proportional to the clock speed multiplied\nby amount of transistor flips we\u2019re doing.\n\npower ~= clock speed * \u201ctransistor flips per clock\u201d.\n\nWe run into throttling when the power we use surpasses the power limit we\u2019ve\nset. Thus:\n\n  1. If we reduce our power limit we exacerbate this effect.\n\n  2. If we reduce the clock speed we reduce this effect.\n\nLet\u2019s show that in action! To do so, I\u2019ll compare the relative performance of\na very predictable input (zeros) vs a very unpredictable input (randn).\n\nAs expected, we see that as the power limit decreases from 330W down to 100W\n(the minimum), the relevant performance improvement from using predictable\ninputs increases. Interestingly, at the lowest power limit (100W), the trend\nreverses. I\u2019m guessing that the GPU is so power constrained that even using\nall zeros still results in too much power usage. Remember that the switching\npower is coming from every transistor in the GPU, not just the ones holding\ndata! So that includes the transistors for say, keeping track of the current\nprogram counter, keeping track of how many loop iterations you need to\nperform, the ones signaling other transistors to perform operations, pretty\nmuch everything that a GPU can possibly be doing.\n\nNow, to test the effect of GPU clocks on using predictable vs. unpredictable\ninputs, I\u2019ll use a a power limit of 200 and vary the GPU clock limit.\n\nWe see that at the top range of the clock frequency, there is nearly no change\nin the ratio, as presumably even with predictable inputs, we\u2019re still getting\nthrottled. Then, as we decrease the clock speed, the relative gap shrinks as\npredictable inputs are affected by the clock speed limit, but not\nunpredictable inputs. Finally, at the very left of the chart, both using\npredictable and unpredictable inputs have identical performance, as both\nbecome completely limited by our manual clock speed limit and don\u2019t do any\npower throttling.\n\nAnother interesting thing we can test is, for a given input and power limit,\nwhat is the maximum clock speed the GPU can sustain for a matmul?\n\n#\n\nMarketing vs \u201cReal\u201d Performance\n\nThis observation that GPUs are unable to sustain their peak clock speed due to\npower throttling is one of the primary factors that separates \u201creal\u201d matmul\nperformance from Nvidia\u2019s marketed specs.\n\nThe figure that Nvidia provides for marketing is:\n\nFor example, on an H100, there are 528 tensor cores per GPU (4 per SM), the\nmax clock speed for these is 1.830 Ghz, and the FLOP per tensor-core\ninstruction is 1024. Thus, we have 1.830e9 * 528 * 1024 = 989 TFLOPS, exactly\nNvidia\u2019s listed number.\n\nHowever, you can only achieve this number by sustaining 1.83 Ghz clocks, and\nas we\u2019ve seen above, the GPU just doesn\u2019t have enough power to do that!\n\nDo note that in both of these cases, the GPUs have a higher power limit than I\ncan test (400W on A100 and 700W on H100 respectively), so it\u2019s able to sustain\na higher clock speed than what\u2019s charted here. But we can see that, especially\non the H100, the max sustainable clock speed is much lower than the\ntheoretical one! In other words, matmuls on the H100 are primarily not compute\nor bandwidth limited, they are power limited.\n\nAs many have noted, power is increasingly a crucial constraint. So, although\nthe H100 theoretically had 3x more FLOPS than the A100, its \u201creal\u201d performance\nhas usually been closer to 2x due to the power throttling we\u2019ve been\ndiscussing, and its \u201cflops per watt\u201d is even less than that.\n\n#\n\nConclusion\n\nAll of this should make you exceedingly curious to see the actual performance\nimprovement on the B100, which has a 1.75x theoretical increase in FLOPS with\nthe same power usage as the H100. I have a Manifold market about guessing the\nmax FLOPS utilization on a B100.\n\nI\u2019ll leave you with a slightly modified version of this tweet from roon.\n\nThanks to Sophia Wisdom, Vijay Thakkar, Philippe Tillet, Dylan Patel, and\nNatalia Gimelshein who have helped me understand this phenomenon.\n\nAlso, be aware that you need to set the `scale` parameter on the CUTLASS\nprofiler if you wanna compare its FLOPS numbers to other benchmarks!\n\nThonk From First Principles is a reader-supported publication.

They\u2019re usually disposable\nobjects many people use daily, but probably don\u2019t think too much about aside\nfrom when you accidentally steal one from the bank. Here\u2019s a pen that would\nprobably be the most fun you\u2019ve ever had writing. A YouTuber has milled a six-\nspeed manual pen out of copper and the coolest part is that the pen works,\nwith each gear deploying a different color pen or a pen eraser.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling a sense of Deja Vu, it could be because you may have seen\nsomething similar to this before. A couple of years ago, YouTuber W&M Levsha\nmade a different pen with a manual transmission. That pen is also a work of\nart, but the \u201ctransmission\u201d portion wasn\u2019t functional outside of being able to\nretract the pen.\n\nDavid Goes To The XPEL Expo\n\nYouTuber Maker B has taken this concept further. This pen not only has a\nmanual transmission where each gear is attached to its own pen color, but you\nhave to use the cutest clutch pedal in the world to change \u201cgears.\u201d Writing\nhas never been so engaging.\n\nMaker B is a channel run by a person who goes by Jony. The channel is\nrefreshing in that it doesn\u2019t serve up 20 minutes of people messing around and\n5 minutes of actual content. Jony gets right into the project at hand and you\nget to watch something new get made in awesome detail. There\u2019s no clickbait,\nno annoying music, and not even fancy graphics. There isn\u2019t even any\ncommentary to spoil the sounds of machinery and hands at work. It\u2019s also not\njust for show, either, as Jony has a website where technical drawings of the\nprojects are sold. That way, you can make your own version of whatever object\nyou saw get made. The pen isn\u2019t there yet, but hopefully, it will be there\nsoon.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe pen starts life as a tube of copper. Jony slices it in two with a saw\nbefore milling little pieces of copper into the pen\u2019s body. It\u2019s deeply\nsatisfying to watch how the threads on the pen\u2019s case get made and how you can\nturn a cylinder of copper into the cone at the bottom of the pen.\n\nThe real magic starts happening after when Jony turns a small piece of metal\ninto the most adorable gated shifter. The detail is incredible here from the\nengraved gear numbers to the use of a paint marker to make each gear in the\nshifter pop.\n\nThe clutch pedal is even more amazing. It started out as a coin-sized piece of\nmetal. A bunch of milling later and just look at the little guy!\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith the body, shift gates, and clutch pedal made, it\u2019s time to make the pen\u2019s\ninternals. As I said earlier, Jony does not explain anything in this video.\nJony next makes a slender shifter complete with an impossibly tiny shift knob.\n\nIt appears the shifter acts on one of six shift pushrods. There\u2019s also a\nlocking pin to keep the chosen ink color in place as well as a cap with six\nholes in it to align each ink refill. With all of that finished, plus other\nsmall bits, Jony puts the pen together.\n\nHere, you can see how things work. Jony arranges ink refills of five colors,\nplus an eraser. Each refill gets a pushrod, a spring, and what appears to be a\nsmall locking ring.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe ink refills are then sent into the internal structure of the pen, the\n\u201cclutch pedal\u201d is connected, and the shifter is sent through the gate. The\npen\u2019s function appears to be straightforward. Choose a gear and click in to\nset it. If you want to change gear, hit the clutch to release the locking pin\nand unlock the shifter. Then, choose your next gear (color) or reverse if you\nwant the eraser.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I had several funky pens that deployed several different\ncolors. This is exactly like one of those pens, but far more fun to play with\nand beautifully crafted out of metal.\n\nSadly, Jony won\u2019t be putting these into production, but the YouTuber provides\na list of tools used in each creation and hopefully, the plans will be made\navailable. Honestly, you could just ignore everything I\u2019ve written here. Watch\nthe video, it\u2019ll probably be the best moment of tranquility you have all day.\n\nHat tip to VanGuy on our Discord!

CNCs may be better in a lot of ways when it comes to\nproduction, but man are they bloody boring to run.\n\n0\n\nRayJay\n\n1 hour ago\n\nThe Pelikan M800/1000 machined brass piston actuator assembly is pretty\nawesome for a production pen, but the complexity and detail on this project\nare incredible.\n\n0\n\nA.

Do You Care?\n\nSteven Cole Smith\n\n29 April 2024\n\nShare\n\nNewspress\n\nYou may not be aware that history was made last weekend, but apparently quite\na few techno-geeks did: It was the inaugural event of the Abu Dhabi Autonomous\nRacing League at the Yas Marina road course, with eight driverless formula\ncars from around the world competing, or trying to, as the event revealed that\nautonomous racing isn\u2019t quite ready for prime time.\n\nThat said, the Autonomous Racing League claims that 10,000 spectators watched\nthe event in person, while over 600,000 watched it online. Since the broadcast\nwas more than three hours long, and the actual race was just eight laps among\nfour cars, with two that actually finished, it took some stamina to watch the\nwhole show.\n\nThat broadcast was decidedly of the rah-rah variety, including contributions\nfrom American broadcaster Amanda Busick, absent from her usual role as pit\nreporter for the NHRA drag racing. It was a \u201cstupendous weekend!\u201d for the\nAutonomous Racing League\u2019s inaugural event, Busick posted on her Instagram\naccount. \u201cHard to verbalize how professionally satisfying this experience\nwas.\u201d\n\nCompeting were modified versions of the Dallara Super Formula SF23 car, which\nis described in the press release as being \u201cthe fastest open-wheel race car in\nthe world after Formula 1,\u201d which is probably surprising to IndyCar given\nthese SF23s are powered by a 2.0-liter, four-cylinder engine.\n\nIn one time-filling segment, former Formula 1 driver Daniil Kvyat raced\nagainst one of the autonomous cars, provided by the Technology Innovation\nInstitute, and beat it by 10.38 seconds. That would normally be a substantial\nmargin, but the Autonomous Racing League described it as \u201ca narrow victory.\u201d\n\n##### Marketplace\n\nBuy and sell classics with confidence\n\nBrowse Marketplace\n\n1964 Chevrolet Impala Sports Sedan Mount Juliet, Tennessee\n\n$5,750\n\n\\-- : -- : --\n\n2004 Chevrolet SSR Mount Juliet, Tennessee\n\n$20,337\n\n\\-- : -- : --\n\n1919 Chevrolet \"Four-Ninety\" Touring Car Mount Juliet, Tennessee\n\n$5,250\n\n\\-- : -- : --\n\n1926 Chevrolet Superior Touring Mount Juliet, Tennessee\n\n$4,000\n\n\\-- : -- : --\n\n1933 Chevrolet Master Sport Roadster Mount Juliet, Tennessee\n\n$13,000\n\n\\-- : -- : --\n\n1950 Chevrolet Fleetline Deluxe Four-Door Sedan Mount Juliet , Tennessee\n\n$8,000\n\n\\-- : -- : --\n\n1993 Mercedes-Benz 300 D 2.5 Turbo Mount Juliet, Tennessee\n\n$2,300\n\n\\-- : -- : --\n\n1953 Chevrolet Series 210 2-Door Sedan Mount Juliet, Tennessee\n\n$6,950\n\n\\-- : -- : --\n\nBrowse Marketplace\n\nBrowse Marketplace\n\nThere were multiple qualifying sessions, in which one autonomous car simply\nturned right into a barrier along a straightaway, and another car locked up\nall four wheels and braked to a dead stop as it approached a left-hand corner.\n\u201cIt appears to be a coding error,\u201d we were told repeatedly when a car\nmisbehaved.\n\nThe Technical University of Munich celebrates the inaugural win in the\nA2RLNewspress\n\nBy the time the eight-lap race was ready to run, only four cars made it to the\nstarting line, and two of them seemed to disappear from the broadcast, as\ncameras concentrated on the race between TUM, the car entered by the Technical\nUniversity of Munich, and an Italian entry named UNIMORE. TUM passed it on the\nlast lap when UNIMORE simply stopped on the track, right in the racing line.\n\nStill, the organizers were jubilant. Said H.E. Faisal Al Bannai, Secretary\nGeneral of the Advanced Technical Research Council: \u201cThrough the Abu Dhabi\nAutonomous Racing League, we\u2019ve sparked a race revolution ... This event isn\u2019t\njust a race; it\u2019s a transformative moment where technology, imagination, and\nambition converge.\u201d\n\nMuch can be excused for an inaugural event of this sort: The technology,\nthough unreliable, was impressive, and it\u2019s easy to imagine it improving\ndramatically over the next few years. But the question remains: Can you get\nexcited by a race with cars driven by AI instead of a person?\n\nYou can watch the three-hour, 12-minute Autonomous Racing League broadcast\nhere.\n\n***\n\nCheck out the Hagerty Media homepage so you don\u2019t miss a single story, or\nbetter yet, bookmark it.

It\u2019s the interaction between\ndriver/car/team/track/and other racers that makes it all work. Take any one of\nthose elements out, and it\u2019s just playing with toys on the carpet.\n\nReply\n\n## Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nHagerty.
