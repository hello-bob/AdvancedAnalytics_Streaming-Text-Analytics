First and foremost, thank you to everyone who made a nomination,\nand to all the nominees for their interest in contributing to F-Droid\u2019s\ngovernance. Juliana Sims, Peter Serwylo and myself, Sebastian Crane, have been\nselected for two year terms on the Board. I feel honoured to have been chosen\nand look forward to serving the F-Droid community, a sentiment I share with my\nfellow new arrivals:\n\n> \u201cAs a passionate free software advocate and F-Droid user, I am delighted to\n> bring my experience with community organizing and moderation to the Board in\n> order to help the F-Droid project and community continue to grow equitably\n> and inclusively into the future.\u201d - Juliana Sims\n\n> \u201cF-Droid is an extremely important part of the free software ecosystem. With\n> so many people carrying powerful computers in their pockets, it is more\n> important than ever to have a strong free software alternative to the\n> proprietary app stores, walled gardens, and adware found elsewhere. I\u2019m\n> constantly amazed by what the F-Droid team and community have achieved, and\n> look forward to serving on the board, bringing my software development and\n> computer science background to help the project grow.\u201d - Peter Serwylo\n\nNot only will this bring new perspectives to the Board, but it will also\nenhance its geographic diversity. Peter lives in Australia, Juliana is on the\nUSA\u2019s Eastern Seaboard, and I hail from Britain. That means two countries\nhitherto unrepresented on the Board of Directors, and our first director from\nsouth of the Equator! This is especially welcome given how F-Droid is part of\nthe global movement of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).\n\nAs originally planned, Max Mehl, one the founding directors of the Board, is\nleaving. I am sure I speak for the whole F-Droid community in wanting to\nexpress gratitude for his service to the project. Max has a few words with\nwhich to bid the Board farewell:\n\n> \u201cI would like to thank the F-Droid community and my fellow Board members for\n> giving me the opportunity to serve on the founding Board. Having been an\n> avid user since the early days of F-Droid, this role has made the often\n> time-consuming and tedious background tasks much more transparent to me. So\n> my greatest appreciation goes to the volunteers who put so much long-term\n> work into F-Droid!\n>\n> My wish and hope is that the Board will continue to reduce the friction for\n> current and future F-Droid contributors, while at the same time\n> professionalising the handling of incidents and conflicts. I am confident\n> that the Board in its new composition has everything it takes to succeed.\u201d -\n> Max Mehl\n\nAndrew Lewman and Matthias Kirschner continue their two-year terms as\ndirectors, and Hans-Christoph Steiner continues his two-year term as Technical\nLead (a non-director role advisory to the Board). Showing their belief in\nF-Droid, Morgan Lemmer-Webber, John Sullivan and Michael Downey volunteered to\ncontinue after their initial one-year terms and have subsequently been re-\nelected. This will help to maintain continuity in what is the first change to\nthe Board\u2019s composition since its founding, and brings the total number of\ndirectors to eight, up from six directors during the Board\u2019s first year.\n\nSince its formation, the F-Droid Board of Directors has had four designated\nroles, namely that of Chair, Vice Chair, Clerk and Treasurer. Although none of\nthe directors holding these positions are leaving, the Board has chosen to\nintroduce one additional role and reassign an existing one: Peter will take\nthe newly-created position of Vice Clerk, and I will succeed Morgan as the\nChair. John, Andrew and Michael will continue in their capacities of Vice\nChair, Clerk and Treasurer respectively.\n\nThe Board is therefore now composed as follows:\n\n  * Sebastian Crane (Chair) - until 2026\n  * Michael Downey (Treasurer) - reappointed, until 2025\n  * Matthias Kirschner - until 2025\n  * Morgan Lemmer-Webber - reappointed, until 2025\n  * Andrew Lewman (Clerk) - until 2025\n  * Peter Serwylo (Vice Clerk) - until 2026\n  * Juliana Sims - until 2026\n  * Hans-Christoph Steiner - ex officio, until 2026\n  * John Sullivan (Vice Chair) - reappointed, until 2026\n\nDuring 2024, the Board of Directors intends to form new subcommittees to\nestablish additional points of liaison between the Board and those interested\nin specific aspects of F-Droid\u2019s activities (fundraising, for instance). If\nthe prospect of participating in such discussions interests you, please keep\nan eye out for further announcements! Board meetings continue to be open to\nthe entire community, and will be announced in advance on the F-Droid Forum.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSebastian Crane on behalf of the F-Droid Board of Directors\n\n### Donate\n\nF-Droid is powered by your donations!\n\n  * More Options\n\n### Connect\n\n@fdroidorg@floss.social\n\n### News\n\n  * F-Droid Board of Directors appointments 2024 Apr 29, 2024\n  * Safety in typing, no cloud needed Apr 25, 2024\n  * Maintaining ownership Apr 18, 2024\n  * Good weather for a new keyboard Apr 11, 2024\n  * Favor your repository Apr 04, 2024\n\n### Last Updated\n\n#### Valv\n\nAn encrypted gallery vault for Android devices\n\n#### My Expenses\n\nEasy to use personal finance manager: rich functionality and Open Source\n\n#### Safe Space\n\nA safe space for your digital valuables.\n\n### Latest Apps\n\n#### SpamBlocker (Call & SMS)\n\nSpam Call/SMS blocker\n\n#### Metadata Remover\n\nProtect your privacy by removing metadata from your photos!\n\n#### Fossify Notes\n\nTo do list widget with a notebook organizer, checklist, simple shopping list\n\n\u00a9 2010-2024 F-Droid Contributors Status | Edit on GitLab\n\n", "frontpage": false}
