People forgot what \u2018normal\u2019 looks like.\n\nBy the Editorial Board\n\n|\n\nDecember 2, 2023 at 7:00 a.m. EST\n\nBlack Friday shoppers wait in line at an UGG store at Woodbury Common Premium\nOutlets in Central Valley, N.Y., on Nov. 24. (Vincent Alban/Reuters)\n\nListen\n\n4 min\n\nShare\n\nComment993\n\nSave\n\nIt has been a miracle year for the U.S. economy. Inflation has plummeted\nwithout triggering a recession. Many experts said that could not happen\nwithout widespread layoffs and a downturn. The economy has gained 2.4 million\njobs so far this year, and growth has accelerated, with an annualized rate\ntopping 5 percent in the third quarter. The good news has also fueled a stock\nmarket rally. In polls, people are downbeat about this economy, but their\nactions don\u2019t match their words. There has been a consumption boom this year.\nAmericans continued to spend heavily on apparel, concerts and vacations. In\nmany ways, this is the year the economy finally returned to something close to\nnormal. But many people seem to have forgotten what normal looks like after a\ntraumatic few years.\n\nIt seems inevitable that growth will slow from here. Many American consumers\nhave been spending more than they earn lately, enabled by all the extra\nsavings people built up during the covid-19 pandemic (and an alarming rise in\ncredit card balances). At some point, consumers have to scale back. Americans\nhave also been buoyed by unprecedented growth in their wealth in recent years,\nlargely because of surging home and stock market prices. It wasn\u2019t just the\nrich getting richer. Net worth rose for Americans of all income levels, ages\nand races from 2019 to 2022, according to Federal Reserve data. Still, there\nare signs consumers are getting choosier. As retailer Nordstrom warned in its\nrecent earnings call, \u201cWe continue to see a cautious consumer.\u201d It\u2019s still\npossible the United States will see a \u201csoft landing\u201d that avoids a painful\nrecession, but growth is likely to be lackluster in 2024 as consumption cools.\n\nThe job market is the key indicator to watch. It has been easy to find a job\nin recent years. That, too, has helped boost consumption. But hiring is\nslowing down. Companies are getting more selective. Workers are no longer\nquitting en masse, and people are staying unemployed longer, a sign that it\u2019s\ngetting harder to find a new job after a layoff. The current unemployment rate\nof 3.9 percent is very low, but even a modest rise in that rate could spook\nAmericans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nFederal Reserve officials are almost certainly done hiking interest rates.\nThey need to recognize that the labor market is back in balance. Job openings\nstill appear high, but companies are being very picky. The hiring rate has\nfallen sharply this year. Meanwhile, inflation is getting close to the Fed\u2019s 2\npercent target. Data released Thursday shows the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation\nmetric has fallen to a 2.5 percent annualized rate in the past six months. The\nrecent years\u2019 inflation spike was driven a lot more by supply problems than\nmany realized \u2014 or admitted. It appears that spike was transitory. It just\ntook longer than many expected to work out the supply chain chaos and hire\nback enough workers. With gas prices back down and rent and food price\nincreases moderating, the Fed looks likely to meet its inflation goal in 2024.\n\nThe debate now is when the Fed will start cutting interest rates. Stocks have\nbeen rallying in recent weeks as investors are betting a cut will come by May.\nThat would certainly help the housing market, which has frozen with mortgage\nrates at the highest levels in about two decades. The Fed has to see how the\ndata comes in this winter, but it would make sense to bring rates back to a\nlower level now that many pandemic problems are over. That doesn\u2019t mean a\nreturn to near-zero. But, as New York Fed President John Williams said\nThursday, rates are \u201cthe most restrictive in 25 years.\u201d The Fed cannot declare\nthe inflation fight won prematurely, but current rates might soon seem\nexcessive.\n\nAs for President Biden and Congress, they can help by finally agreeing on a\nbudget for this fiscal year and, even better, launching a bipartisan debt\ncommission to begin tackling the nation\u2019s dire long-term fiscal challenges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nSo who gets credit for the economic miracle? It\u2019s clear the Fed restored trust\nin its judgment and, in turn, that inflation would come down. Mr. Biden\u2019s $1.9\ntrillion stimulus also played a role by beefing up people\u2019s savings. That is\nstill fueling stronger-than-expected consumption. Mr. Biden\u2019s aid also drove a\nlot of hiring this year in state and local governments.\n\nBut the biggest factor is a return to normal \u2014 companies untangling supply\nchains even as people returned to stores. The United States has a chance to\nstick its soft landing. It would be even better \u2014 for the country\u2019s economy\nand its politics \u2014 if Americans believed it could happen.\n\n### The Post\u2019s View | About the Editorial Board\n\nEditorials represent the views of The Post as an institution, as determined\nthrough discussion among members of the Editorial Board, based in the Opinions\nsection and separate from the newsroom.\n\nMembers of the Editorial Board: Opinion Editor David Shipley, Deputy Opinion\nEditor Charles Lane and Deputy Opinion Editor Stephen Stromberg, as well as\nwriters Mary Duenwald, Shadi Hamid, David E.
