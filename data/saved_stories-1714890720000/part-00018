The frunk chopped all of\nthe produce when it was placed in the frunk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It is destroying everything,\" the YouTuber said.\n\nThe YouTuber then tried the same test with the update installed and was\nimpressed with the improvement.\n\n\"With just a software update, the Tesla Cybertruck frunk is way safer,\" he\nsaid. \"We witnessed it destroy a ton of vegetables, and then post-update did\nnothing.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nBut when Judkins tried putting a thin tip of a carrot in the frunk, it did\nbreak off. He said that left people wondering if a fingertip would also come\noff if it got caught in the frunk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJudkins then closed the frunk on his arm, which he said put a little pressure\non it but wasn't too bad. Next, he tried out his hand, which left a line, but\nalso wasn't severe.\n\nFinally, Judkins placed his finger in the frunk. The frunk closed on his\nfinger and left it shaking, with a dent, and what looked like a small cut or\nskin tear.\n\n\"It kind of locked down on it and I was a little freaked out because I didn't\nknow how to open it up,\" Judkins said. \"I was kind of trapped.\"\n\nThe YouTuber said the frunk detected resistance for a little bit and opened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJudkins said that after the finger test, a lead cybertruck engineer at Tesla\nsaid he did the video wrong.\n\nThe engineer told him the frunk increases in pressure every single time it\ncloses and detects resistance, Judkins said. It's going to assume you want to\nclose the frunk and maybe something like a bag is getting in the way, which\nwould make it close harder.\n\n\"Using this information, that means it closed on my finger harder than my hand\nand way harder than my arm,\" the YouTuber wrote.\n\nJudkins said the algorithm should favor safety instead of a bag getting in the\nway. But even when Judkins put a bag in the way of closing the frunk, it still\nclosed, which meant it didn't quite respond to resistance the way it should\nhave.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe YouTuber attempted to try the test again with his finger without trying\nother objects or his arm first but backed away every time the frunk was about\nto close.\n\n\"You don't know how bad it hurt the first time,\" Judkins said. \"I don't want\nto do it again.\"\n\nJudkins said the update might make your banana safe, but fingers aren't quite\nin the clear.\n\nRead next\n\n### Watch: How did Tesla's bulletproof Cybertruck become so expensive and so\ndelayed?\n\nTesla YouTuber\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecommended video\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow us on:\n\n  * * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.
