Electrification and competition from China\nare booting thousands of highly skilled workers back onto the job market.\nLuckily, many are eyeing a sector that can\u2019t hire fast enough: defense.\n\nSince Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine two years ago, arms manufacturers have\nexperienced something of a reversal of fortune. Once associated with the likes\nof \"sin industries\u201d such as tobacco and gambling, these companies are now seen\nas attractive potential employers \u2014 and particularly if they\u2019re helping fight\nthe war in Ukraine.\n\nHensoldt, which makes air defense sensors crucial to intercepting Russian\nmissiles in Ukraine, has seen an influx of new employees, mainly engineers,\ncoming from carmakers. \"We benefit from the problems in other industries when\nbuilding up our workforce,\u201d said former CEO Thomas Mueller, who was succeeded\nby Oliver Doerre in April. The company is planning to hire 700 new employees\nacross divisions this year.\n\nPart of the push to bring in more workers has to do with the massive\nchallenges facing Ukraine. For every artillery shell the country has left in\nstock, Russia has 10, according to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\nWhile companies are scaling up fast, the European Union hasn\u2019t been able to\nproduce weapons or ammunition quickly enough to meet wartime demand.\n\nRheinmetall, Germany\u2019s biggest arms maker, expects sales to top \u20ac10 billion\nthis year, up from \u20ac7.2 billion in 2023. It plans to expand its annual\nproduction of artillery shells to 700,000 rounds by 2025, a tenfold increase\ncompared to before the Russian invasion, and has hired around 4,000 people\nglobally since the beginning of 2022. Applications have only continued to\nsoar.\n\nLast year, 108,000 people applied for jobs at the company in Germany alone,\nCEO Armin Papperger said in the company\u2019s full-year earnings call in March.\nHaving already received around 38,500 applications this year, the company is\non track to beat those numbers.\n\nGearbox-maker Renk has seen applications more than double since 2021, and\nthose numbers are set to rise even further in 2024, says Chief Human Resources\nOfficer Brigitte Schnakenbourg. The quality of applications has improved as\nwell, she added. \"We receive many more unsolicited applications from people\nwith excellent profiles,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile Schnakenbourg has yet to see large numbers of former autoworkers joining\nthe company, between downsizing at carmakers and the sector\u2019s renewed appeal\nto workers, she thinks this might happen with time. And a sense of mission\nisn\u2019t the only reason why skilled workers have been drawn to defense:\nAccording to the job platform Stepstone, salaries are higher than in other\nfields, with an average pay of around \u20ac68,000 before taxes. \"People find\nsecure jobs here because the industry is booming,\u201d Schnakenbourg said.\n\nRenk recently recruited Chief Operating Officer Emmerich Schiller, who spent\nover 25 years in management positions at Mercedes-Benz, including as managing\ndirector and head of operations for the Mercedes-AMG sports car division.\n\nIn his new role, Schiller will be tasked with scaling up output as order\nvolumes increase. \"After decades in a slumber, production in this industry\ndoes not currently correspond to modern industrial standards,\u201d he said. Having\nbeen trained to make high-quality products quickly while under pressure,\nformer autoworkers have the skills needed to shape the industry during a time\nof unprecedented expansion. \"It makes sense,\u201d Schiller said, \"to transfer this\nknow-how.\u201d\n\nWith the war in Ukraine in its third year and not expected to wind down soon,\nthe sector is likely to be increasingly seen as essential to the public\ninterest.\n\nWhile, according to a Hensoldt spokeman, \"for the last 30 years, employees in\ndefense would rather not say where they work in public,\u201d that\u2019s no longer the\ncase.\n\n\"Today, our sector is no longer in the dirty corner,\u201d said Mueller, the former\nHensoldt CEO.\n\n### KEYWORDS\n\nGermany(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/germany),\ndefense(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/defense),\nmanufacturing(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/manufacturing), Russia-Ukraine\nwar(https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/russia-ukraine-war)\n\nIn a time of both misinformation and too much information, quality journalism\nis more crucial than ever.
