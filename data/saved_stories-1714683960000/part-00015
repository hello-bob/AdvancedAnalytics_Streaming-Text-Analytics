PAUL (05/01/2024) \u2014 For the first time, chemists in the\nUniversity of Minnesota Twin Cities College of Science and Engineering have\ncreated a highly reactive chemical compound that has eluded scientists for\nmore than 120 years. The discovery could lead to new drug treatments, safer\nagricultural products, and better electronics.\n\nFor decades, researchers have been investigating molecules called\nN-heteroarenes, which are ring-shaped chemical compounds that contain one or\nmore nitrogen atoms. Bio-active molecules having a N-heteroarene core are\nwidely used for numerous medicinal applications, lifesaving pharmaceuticals,\npesticides and herbicides, and even electronics.\n\n\u201cWhile the average person does not think about heterocycles on a daily basis,\nthese unique nitrogen-containing molecules are widely applied across all\nfacets of human life,\u201d said Courtney Roberts, the senior author of the study\nand a University of Minnesota Department of Chemistry assistant professor who\nholds the 3M Alumni Professorship.\n\nThese molecules are highly sought out by many industries, but are extremely\nchallenging for chemists to make. Previous strategies have been able to target\nthese specific molecules, but scientists have not been able to create a series\nof these molecules. One reason for this is that these molecules are extremely\nreactive. They are so active that chemists have used computational modeling to\npredict that they should be impossible to make. This has created challenges\nfor more than a century and prevented a solution to create this chemical\nsubstance.\n\nThis graphic depicts the chemical compound that the team of chemists was able\nto discover. Credit: University of Minnesota\n\n\u201cWhat we were able to do was to run these chemical reactions with specialized\nequipment while getting rid of elements commonly found in our atmosphere,\u201d\nsaid Jenna Humke, a University of Minnesota chemistry graduate student and\nlead author on the paper. \u201cLuckily, we have the tools to do that at the\nUniversity of Minnesota. We ran experiments under nitrogen in a closed-chamber\nglovebox, which creates a chemically inactive environment to test and move\nsamples.\u201d\n\nThese experiments were accomplished by using organometallic catalysis\u2014the\ninteraction between metals and organic molecules. The research required\ncollaboration between both organic and inorganic chemists. This is something\nthat is common at the University of Minnesota.\n\n\u201cWe were able to solve this long-standing challenge because the University of\nMinnesota Department of Chemistry is unique in that we don\u2019t have formal\ndivisions,\u201d Roberts added. \u201cThis allows us to put together a team of experts\nin all fields of chemistry, which was a vital component in completing this\nproject\u201d\n\nAfter introducing the chemical compound in this paper, the next steps will be\nto make it widely available to chemists across multiple fields to streamline\nthe creation process. This could help solve important problems like preventing\nfood scarcity and treating illnesses to save lives.\n\nAlong with Roberts and Humke, the University of Minnesota research team\nincluded postdoctoral researcher Roman Belli, graduate students Erin Plasek,\nSallu S. Kargbo, and former postdoctoral researcher Annabel Ansel.\n\nThis work was primarily funded by the National Institutes of Health and the\nNational Science Foundation. Funding was also provided by four University of\nMinnesota-sponsored graduate research fellowships and start-up funding\nprovided by the Department of Chemistry.\n\nTo read the entire research paper titled, \u201cNickel binding enables isolation\nand reactivity of previously inaccessible 7-Aza-2,3-indolynes\u201d, visit the\nScience website.\n\n### Contacts:\n\nRhonda Zurn, College of Science and Engineering, rzurn@umn.edu\n\nUniversity Public Relations, unews@umn.edu\n\n### Read more stories:\n\nFind more news and feature stories on the CSE news page.\n\n## Related news releases\n\n  * Researchers advance detection of gravitational waves to study collisions of neutron stars and black holes\n\n  * Automated machine learning robot unlocks new potential for genetics research\n\n  * U of M researchers lead NASA\u2019s first solar flare observation campaign\n\n  * New study reveals breakthrough in understanding brain stimulation therapies\n\n  * Study provides new insights into deadly acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\n\n## Share\n\nShareFacebookX\n\n### CSE Dean's Office\n\n117 Pleasant St, Minneapolis MN 55455 (612) 624-2006 cseinfo@umn.edu\n\n#### CSE Student Services\n\n105 Lind Hall, 207 Church St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 (612) 624-2890\ncsestudent@umn.edu\n\n\u00a9 2024 Regents of the University of Minnesota.
