The sit-in will be accompanied by\noutdoor protests at Google offices in New York, Sunnyvale, San Francisco, and\nSeattle beginning at 2 pm ET and 11 am PT.\n\nTuesday\u2019s actions mark an escalation in a series of recent protests organized\nby tech workers who oppose their employer\u2019s relationship with the Israeli\ngovernment, especially in light of Israel\u2019s ongoing assault on Gaza. Since\nHamas killed about 1,100 Israelis on October 7, the IDF has killed more than\n34,000 Palestinians.\n\nFeatured Video\n\nJust over a dozen people gathered outside Google\u2019s offices in New York and\nSunnyvale on Tuesday. Among those in New York was Google cloud software\nengineer Eddie Hatfield, who was fired days after disrupting Google Israel\u2019s\nmanaging director at March\u2019s Mind The Tech, a company-sponsored conference\nfocused on the Israeli tech industry, in early March. Several hours into the\nsit-ins on Tuesday, Google security began to accuse the workers of\n\u201ctrespassing\u201d and disrupting work, prompting several people to leave while\nothers vowed to remain until they were forced out.\n\nThe 2021 contract, known as Project Nimbus, involves Google and Amazon jointly\nproviding cloud computing infrastructure and services across branches of the\nIsraeli government. Last week, Time reported that Google\u2019s work on Project\nNimbus involves providing direct services to the Israel Defense Forces. No\nTech for Apartheid is a coalition of tech workers and organizers with MPower\nChange and Jewish Voice for Peace, which are respectively Muslim- and Jewish-\nled peace-focused activist organizations. The coalition came together shortly\nafter Project Nimbus was signed and its details became public in 2021.\n\nNo Tech for Apartheid also published an open letter cosigned by 18 other\norganizations that demands Google and Amazon immediately cancel their work on\nProject Nimbus. At the time of writing, it has gathered more than 93,000\nsignatures from the general public. In addition to Project Nimbus, the letter\ncited recent reports that the IDF has used Google Photos to identify and\ndetain Palestinians en masse in the West Bank.\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to WIRED\u2019s request for comment.\n\nOn March 4, more than 600 other Googlers signed a petition opposing the\ncompany\u2019s sponsorship of the conference. After Hatfield was fired three days\nlater, Google trust-and-safety-policy employee Vidana Abdel Khalek resigned\nfrom her position in opposition to Project Nimbus.\n\nThen, in late March, more than 300 Apple workers signed an open letter that\nalleged retaliation against workers who have expressed support for\nPalestinians, and urged company leadership to show public support for\nPalestinians.\n\nHasan Ibraheem, a Google software engineer, is participating in the sit-in at\nhis local Google office in New York. \u201cThis has really been a culmination of\nour efforts,\u201d he tells WIRED.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Quest to Map the Inside of the Proton\n\nCharlie Wood\n\n  * Gear\n\nIkea\u2019s New Range Is Stealth Mode for Gamers\n\nEric Ravenscraft\n\n  * Science\n\nIt Takes Guts, Not College, to Fix Wind Turbines for a Living\n\nCaitlin Kelly\n\n  * Gear\n\nUse Apple Shortcuts to Build the Ultimate Daily Digital Journal\n\nJustin Pot\n\nSince joining No Tech for Apartheid in December, Ibraheem says, he has been\nparticipating in weekly \u201ctabling\u201d actions being held at Google office caf\u00e9s in\nNew York, Sunnyvale, San Francisco, and Mountain View, California. It involves\nholding a sign that says \u201cAsk me about Project Nimbus\u201d during lunch break,\npassing out flyers, and answering questions from coworkers.\n\n\u201cIt's actually shocking how many people at Google don't even know that this\ncontract exists,\u201d Ibraheem says. \u201cA lot of people who don't know about it, who\nthen learn about it through us, are reasonably upset that this contract\nexists. They just didn't know that it existed beforehand.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time Googlers have mobilized to oppose their company\u2019s\nmilitary work. In 2018, thousands of Google workers mobilized in protest of\nProject Maven, a proposed Pentagon contract that would include AI-powered\ntools to analyze drone footage and choose targets. In response, Google said it\nwouldn\u2019t renew its Project Maven contract. But in the years since, the company\nhas greatly increased its work with the Pentagon.\n\nZelda Montes, a YouTube software engineer also participating in the New York\nsit-in, claims that the action follows a few incidents in which speaking up in\n\u201cappropriate channels\u201d were shut down\u2014such as posting about Project Nimbus in\ninternal company forums, only to have their comments taken down.\n\nMontes says they hope the sit-in inspires tech workers \u201cto demand that their\nlabor not be used to to create the conditions in which a genocide is taking\nplace.\u201d\n\nThey add that they recognize the risk of the sit-in, but they see the work\nthey\u2019ve done for No Tech for Apartheid \u201cthe most important work I\u2019ve ever done\nin my life.\u201d\n\nJust after 4 pm ET on Tuesday, four Google workers, including Ibraheem and\nMontes, continued to protest outside Google's New York office. \u201cSecurity tried\nto lure us out with water and proceeded to try and grab me,\u201d Montes says. The\ngroup, however, has vowed to remain until they are forced to leave\u2014or their\ndemands are met.\n\n\u201cI know that it'll close some doors. It might close this door, it might close\na lot of other big tech doors, but I firmly believe that it will close the\ndoors that need to stay closed and open the ones that need to be opened,\u201d\nMontes says. \u201cI don't mind, and would actually prefer, that where I stand on\nPalestinian Liberation follows me for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * In your inbox: Will Knight's Fast Forward explores advances in AI\n\n  * Hackers found a way to open 3 million hotel keycard locks\n\n  * A couple decided to decarbonize their home.
