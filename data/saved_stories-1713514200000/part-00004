Therefore, using the JavaScript split() method on whitespace\nto split text into words, will return incorrect results.\n\nWhen creating a new Intl.Segmenter object with the Intl.segmenter()\nconstructor, pass in a locale and options including granularity, which can\nhave values of \"grapheme\", \"word\", or \"sentence\". The following example\ncreates a new Intl.Segmenter object for Japanese, splitting on words.\n\n    \n    \n    const segmenter = new Intl.Segmenter('ja-JP', { granularity: 'word' });\n\nCalling the segment() method on an Intl.Segmenter object with a string of text\nreturns an iterable:\n\n    \n    \n    const segments = segmenter.segment(str); console.table(Array.from(segments));\n\nRead Using the Intl.Segmenter API on the Polypane blog for an excellent\ntutorial on how to use this feature.\n\nInternational Text Segmentation with Intl.Segmenter in JavaScript has more\nexamples, including how to use Intl.Segmenter with emoji.\n\nExcept as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 License, and code samples are licensed under\nthe Apache 2.0 License.
