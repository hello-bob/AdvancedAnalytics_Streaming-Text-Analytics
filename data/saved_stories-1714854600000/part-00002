He\nfounded WinRumors, a site dedicated to Microsoft news, before joining The\nVerge in 2012.\n\nMay 3, 2024, 2:55 PM UTC\n\n## Share this story\n\nImage: The Verge\n\nMicrosoft is making security its number one priority for every employee,\nfollowing years of security issues and mounting criticisms. After a scathing\nreport from the US Cyber Safety Review Board recently concluded that\n\u201cMicrosoft\u2019s security culture was inadequate and requires an overhaul,\u201d it\u2019s\ndoing just that by outlining a set of security principles and goals that are\ntied to compensation packages for Microsoft\u2019s senior leadership team.\n\nLast November, Microsoft announced a Secure Future Initiative (SFI) in\nresponse to mounting pressure on the company to respond to attacks that\nallowed Chinese hackers to breach US government email accounts. Just days\nafter announcing this initiative, Russian hackers managed to breach\nMicrosoft\u2019s defenses and spy on the email accounts of some members of\nMicrosoft\u2019s senior leadership team. Microsoft only discovered the attack\nnearly two months later in January, and the same group even went on to steal\nsource code.\n\nThese recent attacks have been damaging, and the Cyber Safety Review Board\nreport added fuel to Microsoft\u2019s security fire recently by concluding that the\ncompany could have prevented the 2023 breach of US government email accounts\nand that a \u201ccascade of security failures\u201d led to that incident.\n\n\u201cWe are making security our top priority at Microsoft, above all else \u2013 over\nall other features,\u201d explains Charlie Bell, executive vice president for\nMicrosoft security, in a blog post today. \u201cWe will instill accountability by\nbasing part of the compensation of the company\u2019s Senior Leadership Team on our\nprogress in meeting our security plans and milestones.\u201d\n\n### Related\n\n  * Microsoft needs to win back trust\n  * Microsoft could have prevented Chinese cloud email hack, US cyber report says\n  * Microsoft \u2018senior leadership\u2019 emails accessed by Russian SolarWinds hackers\n  * Microsoft says Russian hackers stole source code after spying on its executives\n  * Microsoft is overhauling its software security after major Azure cloud attacks\n\nMicrosoft now has three security principles that form a big part of these\ngoals: secure by design; secure by default; secure operations. These\nprinciples are designed to put security first during the design phases of\nproducts and services, place a greater focus on protections that are enabled\nby default, and improve controls and monitoring for current and future\nthreats.\n\nThe broader goals are underlined by \u201csix prioritized security pillars,\u201d which\nis corporate speak for stuff Microsoft needs to greatly improve:\n\n  1. Protect identities and secrets. Microsoft is promising to implement \u201cbest-in-class standards\u201d across its identity and secrets infrastructure so that 100 percent of user accounts are protected using multifactor authentication and 100 percent of applications are protected by managed credentials like certificates.\n  2. Protect tenants and isolate production systems. Microsoft is taking an approach here to ensure only healthy, managed, and secure devices get access to the company\u2019s own set of services, alongside a least-privilege access model (the minimum levels of access or permissions) for 100 percent of applications.\n  3. Protect networks. Microsoft is promising to secure 100 percent of its production networks and systems that are connected to networks by applying isolation and microsegmentation to all production environments. This should help create additional layers of defense against attackers.\n  4. Protect engineering systems. Microsoft says it will secure access to its source code 100 percent of the time through Zero Trust and least-privilege access policies. Any source code that\u2019s deployed to production environments will also be protected by security best practices, and test environments will also have standardized security and infrastructure isolation.\n  5. Monitor and detect threats. Microsoft is promising to retain 100 percent of security logs for two years and make six months of \u201cappropriate logs\u201d available to customers. It will also automatically detect and respond \u201crapidly\u201d to suspicious access or configuration changes across 100 percent of Microsoft\u2019s production infrastructure and services.\n  6. Accelerate response and remediation. The goal here is to prevent unpatched vulnerabilities from being exploited with more \u201ctimely remediation.\u201d Microsoft is committing to reduce the time it takes to fix \u201chigh-severity\u201d cloud security vulnerabilities and increase the transparency around these issues by adopting Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) industry standards.\n\nAll of these goals are tied to some of Microsoft\u2019s leadership compensation and\nare a clear and direct response to the recent Russian hacker intrusions and\nthe Cyber Safety Review Board recommendations.\n\nMicrosoft is now coordinating its engineering teams to complete this work in\nwaves across the company. \u201cThese engineering waves involve teams across Azure\nCloud, Windows, Microsoft 365 and Security, with additional product teams\nintegrating into the process weekly,\u201d says Bell.\n\nMicrosoft is already making progress toward its ambitious security goals. The\ncompany has implemented multifactor by default across more than 1 million of\nits own tenants within Microsoft, including ones used for development,\ntesting, demos, and production. It has also removed 730,000 apps so far that\n\u201cwere out-of-lifecycle or not meeting current SFI standards.\u201d\n\nThe software maker is also trying to improve its security culture after it was\nbranded \u201cinadequate\u201d by the Cyber Safety Review Board. The engineering leads\nat Microsoft are now holding weekly and monthly operational meetings that\ninclude a variety of management and senior individuals, with a goal to improve\nMicrosoft\u2019s security thinking across the company.\n\nMicrosoft is also adding deputy chief information security officers (CISOs) to\neach product team and is moving its threat intelligence team to report\ndirectly to the CISO. That should mean there\u2019s a clear responsibility for\nsecurity in engineering teams.\n\nI reported last month that inside Microsoft there is concern that the recent\nsecurity attacks could seriously undermine trust in the company. \u201cUltimately,\nMicrosoft runs on trust and this trust must be earned and maintained,\u201d says\nBell. \u201cAs a global provider of software, infrastructure and cloud services, we\nfeel a deep responsibility to do our part to keep the world safe and secure.\nOur promise is to continually improve and adapt to the evolving needs of\ncybersecurity. This is job #1 for us.\u201d\n\nFeatured Videos From The Verge\n\n## Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2023 in 10 minutes\n\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\nSamsung\u2019s new S series lineup is here.
