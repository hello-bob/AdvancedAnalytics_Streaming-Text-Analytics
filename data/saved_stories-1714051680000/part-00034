New York is a city of long hours, tiny kitchens, cramped\napartments\u2014and dining out, a lot. There is, improbably, always an occasion:\ndate night, working late, friends in town, New Year\u2019s Eve, too tired to cook,\nin-laws, layoff, anniversary, breakup. But getting a decent dinner reservation\nhere is a challenge. Any well-reviewed Italian joint? You\u2019d better have one.\nGourmet burger place? Good luck. The new French-Korean fried-chicken spot?\nBooked solid for months.\n\nIn New York, the neighborhood restaurant doesn\u2019t have much room for neighbors\nanymore. At Sailor, April Bloomfield and Gabriel Stulman\u2019s new spot in Fort\nGreene, reservations are scooped up fourteen days in advance by residents of\nSoHo, Aspen, and East Hampton, who likely saw the place on some list, or while\ndoomscrolling TikTok or Eater. The majority of diners log on to a restaurant\u2019s\nWeb site at 10:59 A.M., two weeks before they want to eat out, then wait,\nclick, and pray. Pete Wells, who gave Sailor a three-star review in the Times,\nwrote that although the bar and two booths in front are set aside for walk-\nins, reservations \u201cdisappear within minutes of being offered.\u201d Locals are\npolitely quoted a three-hour wait. Of Roscioli, a downtown outpost of the\nfamous Roman restaurant, the Post wrote, \u201cNew Yorkers are risking their lives,\nbegging, bribing and pleading to get a table at the Italian eatery.\u201d\n\nSince the pandemic, tough reservations have gotten even tougher. (One poll\nindicated that, during lockdown, people missed restaurants more than they\nmissed their friends and family.) To sidestep the reservation scrum,\nparticularly at a hundred and fifty of the city\u2019s buzziest restaurants, a new\nsquad of businesses, tech impresarios, and digital legmen has sprung up,\noffering to help diners cut through the reservation red tape, for a price. In\nthe new world order, desirable reservations are like currency; booking\nconfirmations for 4 Charles Prime Rib, a clubby West Village steakhouse, have\nrecently been spotted on Hinge and Tinder profiles.\n\nThe Food Scene\n\nSign up to get Helen Rosner\u2019s weekly newsletter on what, where, and how to\neat.\n\nA certain kind of fat cat has always had someone else\u2014a secretary, a\nconcierge, the butler\u2014make reservations. For regular people, though, booking a\ntable at all but the most exclusive restaurants\u2014Le Pavillon in the fifties,\nthe Four Seasons in the sixties, Sign of the Dove in the seventies, Le Cirque\nin the eighties, Per Se in the two-thousands\u2014required only a telephone.\n\n\u201cMy whole career, that\u2019s what you did,\u201d Michael Cecchi-Azzolina, who worked as\na ma\u00eetre d\u2019 in the eighties and nineties, told me. Reservationists were\ntrained to pick up the phone within three rings; they\u2019d write the name in a\nlog, underlining V.I.P.s twice. \u201cAnd you damn well knew every customer,\u201d he\nsaid. If a regular or a celebrity showed up without a reservation, Cecchi-\nAzzolina usually squeezed them in. \u201cThere\u2019s some kind of alchemy in the\nrestaurant world,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody cancels, somebody\u2019s late, and you\u2019re out\nof the weeds.\u201d One night, when he worked at the River Caf\u00e9, in Brooklyn, a man\npalmed him six hundred dollars for a table. He said he could tell the\ndenomination of the bills by the feel of the paper in his hand: tens and\ntwenties were worn, hundreds were crisp.\n\nIn 2024, plenty of diners are willing to part with six hundred bucks for a\ntable, too, but they are likely paying it to a stranger, via an app.\n\nBen Leventhal, who co-founded the reservation site Resy, in 2014, agreed to\nmeet me for dinner to fill me in on the new restaurant-booking landscape. He\nleft Resy four years ago, after American Express bought the company, and he\nhas since created a customer-loyalty app called Blackbird, which doesn\u2019t make\nbookings but rewards customers with the restaurant equivalent of frequent-\nflyer points. Earlier, he\u2019d told me, \u201cThe average diner in New York City is\nmassively disadvantaged, and they don\u2019t even know it. It\u2019s as if they\u2019re\nbringing a knife to a gunfight.\u201d He\u2019d suggested we meet at Ralph Lauren\u2019s Polo\nBar, on East Fifty-fifth Street\u2014one of the most sought-after tables in town.\n(He booked it.) I found him, wearing a trim blue suit and sitting at a table\nby a fireplace in the equestrian-themed bar. (You also need a reservation to\nget a drink; I watched as a hostess in a camel-hair coat gently turned away a\nwell-dressed couple who looked unaccustomed to being disappointed.) Leventhal\nordered a tequila and jumped right in, \u201cmapping the reservations ecosystem,\u201d\nas he called it, on a cocktail napkin.\n\nHis list of possible approaches went like this: phone call, e-mail, Instagram\nD.M., in-person (\u201cBefore you leave a place, you could make another\nreservation. It\u2019s a great way to get one\u201d), texting someone you know (the\nma\u00eetre d\u2019, a chef, even servers and line cooks), hotel concierges (some\nresidential buildings\u2014432 Park Avenue, 15 Hudson Yards\u2014have their own), \u00e9lite\ncredit-card partners (\u201cChase has tables, Amex has tables\u201d), membership\nreservation clubs like Dorsia, new apps (TableOne claims to show every\navailable publicly listed reservation at the most in-demand restaurants, in\nreal time), secondary marketplaces (in the manner of ticket scalpers, Web\nsites like Cita Marketplace and Appointment Trader will sell you a\nreservation, often procured by a bot, usually made in someone else\u2019s name),\nthe restaurant\u2019s Web site, and online-reservation systems (OpenTable, Resy,\nTock, Yelp). Leventhal described this last category, by far the most common\nway to book a table, as \u201cthe land of democracy, the land of first come, first\nserved.\u201d Then he smirked and said, \u201cIn theory.\u201d\n\nNearby, a woman in red sipped champagne; across the room, a young woman wept.\nA manager strolling by recognized Leventhal and asked about the inked-up\ncocktail napkin. \u201cAre you doing math?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out how reservations work,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an art, and a game of Tetris,\u201d the manager, a blond woman in her\nthirties, said. \u201cSome people really get off on saying no. When we have to say\nno, it feels terrible. People say, \u2018What if I was with Leonardo DiCaprio?\u2019 And\nI\u2019m, like, \u2018Are you?\u2019 \u201d\n\nVideo From The New Yorker\n\nAn Iranian Woman Finds Her Might, in \u201cThe Smallest Power\u201d\n\nDownstairs in the dining room, the ma\u00eetre d\u2019, Nelly Moudime, greeted Leventhal\nwarmly and asked him where he wanted to sit. When Resy started, the app sold\nreservations for about ten per cent of a diner\u2019s average check. (The Times\ncalled it \u201cthe next step in the devolution of New York hospitality.\u201d) After\npublic outcry, Resy changed its model: restaurants pay a small monthly fee;\ndiners don\u2019t pay for reservations. \u201cBut we now have a customer who\nfundamentally believes there\u2019s a price for everything,\u201d Leventhal said,\nfrowning. \u201cNot everything should be purchasable\u2014which makes people\u2019s heads\nexplode. You can\u2019t call up Polo Bar and say, \u2018How much will it cost to get\nin?\u2019 \u201d\n\nYou can, however, call up Polo Bar, wait fifty minutes on hold, make a\nreservation, and then resell it online. (Before meeting me for dinner,\nLeventhal texted me a screenshot of a Cita page, where a five-o\u2019clock table at\nPolo Bar was listed for four hundred dollars.)\n\nMoudime, who wore shimmering silver-sequin pants, dropped by our table to\nchat. She said that a woman had recently called for a last-minute reservation,\nsaying that her mother had just recovered from cancer and wanted to celebrate\nat Polo Bar. At 5:30 P.M., three young people showed up for the table: no mom,\nno cancer. \u201cWe still took care of them,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the new world we live\nin. And, I think, maybe, we created that monster.\u201d\n\nOn a recent Thursday morning, I stopped by Roscioli. Like many hot\nrestaurants, Roscioli usually has tables for famous people, investors, other\nchefs, and regulars. But most are snapped up on Resy as soon as they become\navailable. Amelia Giordano, Roscioli\u2019s reservationist, invited me to sit with\nher in the empty restaurant, the walls lined with bottles of wine, and watch\nher iPad\u2019s screen as the tables filled up for fourteen days hence.\n\nAt 10 A.M. sharp, someone booked a four-top, for 5:45 P.M. By 10:01, there\nwere seven reservations, including two for birthdays. Names started madly\nflashing on the screen. 10:03: \u201cEverything but the later tables have booked,\u201d\nGiordano said. 10:06: fully committed.\n\nAt least a handful of those reservations were made by people who would never\ncross Roscioli\u2019s threshold.\n\nIn May, 2021, a thirty-three-year-old software engineer named Jonas Frey\ncouldn\u2019t get a reservation to renew his driver\u2019s license at the Nevada D.M.V.,\nso he built a Web site to solve the problem. \u201cI thought, \u2018How is it possible\nthat I can\u2019t pay for a spot in line?\u2019 \u201d he told me. That July, after scoring a\ntwenty-two-thousand-dollar break on rent from his landlord, maxing out his\ncredit cards, and staying up all night coding in his underwear for two months\n(\u201cMy wife was just bringing me Red Bull and pizza,\u201d he said), Frey launched\nAppointment Trader, an online marketplace for people to buy and sell\nreservations\u2014everything from private shopping experiences (the Herm\u00e8s store in\nParis), doctors\u2019 appointments (a hot commodity in Miami and Beverly Hills),\nand tables at restaurants all over the world.\n\nThe Web site resembles an artifact from the early days of the Internet: with\nits flashy banners and simple menus, it almost looks like eBay circa 1995. \u201cWe\nget a lot of smack for it being ugly,\u201d Frey said, adding that it hasn\u2019t hurt\nbusiness. Appointment Trader cleared almost six million dollars in reservation\nsales during the past twelve months, a more than twofold increase from last\nyear. New users create an account with their e-mail address to buy or sell\nreservations; sellers compete to earn \u201cTraderpoints\u201d and \u201cmedals,\u201d which allow\nthem to upload more reservations and thereby make more money. Frey takes a\ntwenty- to thirty-per-cent commission.\n\nProspective buyers browse a list of restaurants organized by locale. Frey\ndesigned an algorithm that determines the most popular places based on\nreservation requests; in New York, 4 Charles, Tatiana (an Afro-Caribbean place\nat Lincoln Center), and COQODAQ (Flatiron Korean fried chicken) currently top\nthe list. Users can click around a glitchy Google Maps plug-in, or type a\nrestaurant\u2019s name in the search bar. You can buy a limited selection of\n\u201cinstantly available reservations\u201d\u2014an indoor Friday-night four-top at Don\nAngie, a modern Village trattoria, for two hundred and twenty-five dollars\u2014or\nplace a bid, for a restaurant and a time of your choosing. Then individual\nresellers (for instance, FlirtatiousCanvas69, ExpeditiousFork45) can accept\nthe bid and fulfill it by any means necessary. The buyer is informed of what\nname to give when he or she shows up to claim the table. (This can lead to\nawkward moments at the host stand, particularly for couples on dates: men\nsometimes are obliged to give other women\u2019s names and fumble for phone\nnumbers\u2014the name and number on the purchased reservation.)\n\nThe afternoon before I met Leventhal at Polo Bar, I logged in to Appointment\nTrader, which recommended that I place a \u201cbid\u201d of at least three hundred and\nfifty-five dollars for a two-top there. I started by offering a couple\nhundred: \u201c\ud83e\udd71 Your bid price is below average,\u201d the site shot back. Then I upped\nthe bid to the recommended amount: \u201c\ud83e\udd16 Did we say warmed up? Now you got those\nmercenaries, bots and hustlers on \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25.\u201d\n\nSo who are the resellers, mercenaries, and hustlers who provide Appointment\nTrader with prime tables? Some are people who sit with OpenTable or Resy\npulled up on their laptops every morning, amassing reservations in various\nnames. Some are kids who borrow their parents\u2019 Amex black cards, telephone\nAmex\u2019s Centurion concierge, and book hard-to-get tables that are set aside for\ncard users. Others call in favors with friends in the industry, bribe ma\u00eetre\nd\u2019s, or e-mail reservationists with made-up stories\u2014a diehard foodie visiting\ntown (\u201cwe have always been desperate to come and try your delicious looking\nLasagna!\u201d), or pretending to be the Queen of Morocco or the sister of the King\nof Saudi Arabia. The chef Eric Ripert, of Le Bernardin, widely considered one\nof the best restaurants in the world, told me that it\u2019s not uncommon for\ncallers to scream at and even threaten his reservationists.\n\nAlex Eisler, a sophomore at Brown University who studies applied math and\ncomputer science, regularly uses fake phone numbers and e-mail addresses to\nmake reservations. When he calls Polo Bar, he told me, \u201cSometimes they\nrecognize my voice, so I have to do different accents. I have to act like a\ngirl sometimes.\u201d He switched into a bad falsetto: \u201cI\u2019m, like, \u2018Hiiii, is it\npossible to book a reservation?\u2019 I have a few Resy accounts that have female\nnames.\u201d His recent sales on Appointment Trader, where his screen name is\nGloriousSeed75, include a lunch table at Maison Close, which he sold for eight\nhundred and fifty-five dollars, and a reservation at Carbone, the Village red-\nsauce place frequented by the Rolex-and-Herm\u00e8s crowd, which fetched a thousand\nand fifty dollars. Last year, he made seventy thousand dollars reselling\nreservations.\n\nAnother reseller, PerceptiveWash44, told me that he makes reservations while\nwatching TV. He was standing outside the break room at the West Coast hotel\nwhere he works as a concierge. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, some people play Candy Crush on\ntheir phone. I play \u2018Dinner Reservations,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a way to pass\nthe time.\u201d Last year, he made eighty thousand dollars reselling reservations.\nHe\u2019s good at anticipating what spots will be most in demand, and his profile\non the site ranks him as having a \u201c99% Positive Sales History\u201d over his last\ntwo hundred transactions. It also notes that he made almost two thousand\nreservations that never sold\u2014a restaurateur\u2019s nightmare.\n\nSome resellers use bots\u2014basically, computers that are faster at hitting the\nrefresh button than you are. Several bots might be simultaneously checking the\napp, ten or even a hundred times per second, twenty-four hours a day, until\none finds the eight-o\u2019clock table at Bangkok Supper Club that it\u2019s been\nprogrammed to grab. Instead of using a keyboard or mouse, the bot\nprogrammatically executes the reservation app\u2019s underlying code. Some\nresellers subscribe to such sites as Resy Sniper (fifty bucks a month), which\nuses custom-built bots to snag tough reservations; some use open-source code\nposted on GitHub or write their own.\n\nIn addition to hotel concierges, restaurant employees (ma\u00eetre d\u2019s, hosts, line\ncooks) also sell tables on Appointment Trader, risking their jobs for quick\ncash. Frey explained, \u201cYou\u2019re essentially, virtually, greasing the\npalm\u2014without ever meeting the guy.\u201d\n\nThe origin of the restaurant reservation is murkier than the origin of the\nrestaurant. As Rebecca L. Spang writes in \u201cThe Invention of the Restaurant:\nParis and Modern Gastronomic Culture,\u201d in the eighteenth century, dining out\nin Paris or London meant going to a tavern where dinner was served at a common\ntable, until the food ran out\u2014first come, first served. In the U.S.,\nreservations began to be more common sometime after the turn of the century,\nwhen it became popular to dine out for special occasions: Christmas, New\nYear\u2019s Eve, Election Night. More commonly, wealthy men \u201creserved\u201d private\nrooms at restaurants to entertain guests. (In New York, people vied to host\nthe most elaborate private dinners: at one, the center of a huge table at\nDelmonico\u2019s was removed and replaced with a water tank, for a centerpiece of\nfour swans on loan from Prospect Park.)\n\nIn the twentieth century, the growth of the middle class, suburbanization, and\nthe advent of the newspaper restaurant review made telephone reservations the\nnorm\u2014until the Internet changed everything. In the late nineties, after\nmovies, rental cars, hotels, and airlines had moved advance booking online,\nWeb sites like Savvydiner.com started brokering restaurant reservations.\nDiners would click a button, prompting a Savvydiner employee to telephone a\nrestaurant\u2019s ma\u00eetre d\u2019, who scrawled the name in his book, next to all the\nother people who weren\u2019t yet precipitating the end of an era.\n\nBy 1999, a crop of new Web sites\u2014RSVIP.com, Reservemytable.com, Foodline.com,\nOpenTable.com\u2014were competing to automate the process. Tavern on the Green\u2019s\nowner, Warner LeRoy, started taking reservations on the restaurant\u2019s Web site.\nOther restaurateurs were skeptical. OpenTable charged restaurants a monthly\nfee, plus a dollar for every guest seated. Asked by a reporter what he thought\nabout online reservations, the director of operations at Danny Meyer\u2019s Union\nSquare Cafe scoffed, \u201cThere is no substitute for a kind, human voice on the\nphone.\u2019\u2019 But Meyer became an early investor in OpenTable, and, later, in Resy.\nLast year, he invested in an A.I.-powered reservation platform called\nSevenRooms, which most people haven\u2019t heard about because it\u2019s been designed\nfor diners not to know it exists.\n\nTo be clear: every night in New York, there are hundreds of perfectly good\nseven-thirty tables available at perfectly good restaurants. For a lot of\ndiners, though, the pleasure is in the scarcity; and the smaller, noisier, and\nmore crowded a restaurant is, the better. Some restaurateurs claim to hate the\nbuzz that comes with being popular. Ariel Arce, who operates Roscioli, told\nme, \u201cIf it\u2019s a room full of people who just flock there for a reservation, the\nvibe ain\u2019t gonna be very fun.\u201d Roni Mazumdar, who owns the Unapologetic Foods\ngroup (Semma, Dhamaka, Adda Indian Canteen), told me, \u201cWe only value one\nthing: those who care about us. How do we know you care about us? When you\nshow up and you are cordial to the staff.\u201d He showed me an e-mail with the\nsubject line \u201cUrgent VVIP Request,\u201d from a high-end concierge service that\nalso brokers yacht sales (mission statement: \u201cDedicated to understanding\neverything you want and giving you more than you imagined\u201d), demanding a five-\ntop for an extremely powerful person, who \u201crepresents Matthew McConaughey,\nScarlett Johansson, Chris Rock, Katherine Heigl and Tony Hawk.\u201d Mazumdar\u2019s\nteam sent a reply saying that the client could try to reserve through Resy.\n\nIn 2022, Justin and Hailey Bieber were politely turned away by Carbone when\nthey showed up without a reservation. In February, Hailey and her entourage\nhad dinner at 4 Charles, after a private reservationist named Nicky DiMaggio\nsecured them a table. DiMaggio, who charges between five hundred and a\nthousand dollars per reservation, owns a sanitation business with more than\nforty garbage trucks. He got into the reservation game when he was a teen-\nager, after his cousin got him a reservation at Rao\u2019s, the impregnable mob-\nflavored restaurant in East Harlem. He usually works with referrals. \u201cMy\nclient list is, like, the N.B.A., Megan Fox,\u201d he told me. (DiMaggio also\nclaims that he has worked with reps for Serena Williams, a son of Italy\u2019s\nVice-President, a manager at a Rolex store, and a lot of Goldman Sachs guys.)\nDiMaggio, who is thirty-three, books the tables in his own name (to protect\nhis clients\u2019 privacy, he says). Last year, he made more than a thousand\nreservations at the city\u2019s trendiest restaurants; he claims to have cozied up\nto the owners and managers, who set aside tables for him. In reality, he has\nused Appointment Trader, just like everyone else.\n\nIn Bret Easton Ellis\u2019s novel \u201cAmerican Psycho,\u201d the sociopathic Wall Street\nprotagonist is obsessed with a fictional restaurant called Dorsia\u2014a place so\nexclusive as to be almost mythical. A new, members-only app by the same name\npromises to deliver what the status-mad bros in the novel cannot secure for\nthemselves: a tough table. Aspiring users download the app and allow it to\nscan their contacts (\u201cThe fastest way to get in is with your network,\u201d the\nsite declares), and then answer a few questions: employer, job title,\nInstagram handle, LinkedIn URL. Dorsia is trying to figure out if you are the\nkind of person who will shell out.\n\nIf you pass muster (I only did, I think, because I had saved the numbers of a\nlot of chefs in my contacts while reporting this piece), you can log on to\nDorsia and search for the solidly booked restaurant of your choice. (You enter\nyour credit-card information immediately, of course.) The first reservation I\nspotted was an eight-o\u2019clock Saturday two-top at Carbone; there was also a\nslew of prime-time tables at Le Gratin, one of Daniel Boulud\u2019s offshoots. Then\nI read the fine print: the table at Carbone would cost me a thousand\ndollars\u2014not as a booking fee but as a prepayment for the meal. For two of us\nto get our money\u2019s worth, we\u2019d have to down three plates of Calamari Marco,\nthree orders of lobster ravioli, two veal Marsalas, a funghi trifolati, and\ntwo bottles of Barolo Gramolere.\n\nRestaurants that utilize Dorsia see it as a way to collect data about their\ncustomers, and also to increase revenue by guaranteeing that those customers\nare big spenders. Other minimum prepayments listed on the app: two hundred and\neighty-five dollars per person at Le Pavillon, Boulud\u2019s midtown seafood\npalace; two hundred and thirty-five at Marea, on Central Park South; and three\nhundred at Torrisi (on a Monday), a sister restaurant to Carbone. This summer,\nas Dorsia\u2019s members go on vacation, the app promises to be ready with tables\nat the chicest restaurants in Ibiza, in Mykonos, and along the French Riviera\nand the Amalfi Coast.\n\nIn promotional materials for restaurateurs considering listing their tables on\nthe app, Dorsia claims that it saves twenty minutes per party (no waiting for\nthe check) and so helps turn tables faster\u2014a key to restaurant solvency.\n(Gabriel Stulman, of Sailor, which is not on Dorsia, told me that he needs to\nturn his tables three times a night to make money.) Still, several\nrestaurateurs who have opted out told me that they find the colossal-prepay\nconcept unseemly, in part because it encourages binge eating. \u201cIt\u2019s\npsychotic,\u201d one owner said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to put people in that situation.\u201d\n\nDorsia understands that, like the N.S.A. and TikTok, successful restaurants\nknow more about us than we want to imagine. How many times have you eaten\nthere? Are you a friendly regular, an asshole neighbor, an expense-account\nout-of-towner? Do you prefer a cocktail or the house white? Do you linger\nafter coffee? In the old days, much of that information\u2014and your wife\u2019s\nbirthday, your secretary\u2019s name\u2014lived inside a ma\u00eetre d\u2019s head. Many\nrestaurants have always kept handwritten notes on their guests, relying on\nabbreviations: \u201cH.S.M.\u201d (heavyset man), \u201ceagle\u201d (bald guest), \u201co-o\u201d (wears\nglasses), \u201cl.o.l.\u201d (little old lady). These days, guest notes are \u201cdata,\u201d\nwhich tech platforms help restaurants keep track of. Oenophiles might be\nlabelled \u201cW.W.\u201d (wine whale), or, simply, \u201cdrops coin.\u201d If you got a surprise\nappetizer on the house, you might have been marked down with \u201cS.F.N.\u201d\n(something for nothing), or \u201cN.P.R.\u201d (nice people get rewards). Did you sit\nfor hours over a bowl of soup, tip poorly, get wasted, or shush the young\nfamily sitting at the next table? You might be demoted to \u201cP.N.G.\u201d (persona\nnon grata) or \u201cD.N.S.\u201d (do not serve) status.\n\nResy has a data-driven feature called Notify, which puts diners on a waiting\nlist for a restaurant. (OpenTable and SevenRooms added similar features to\ncompete.) Using it is a little like buying a fistful of lottery tickets.\nDiners add themselves to lots of restaurants\u2019 Notify lists for a certain night\nwith the hope of scoring just one. The moment a host decides that a table is a\nno-show, or if there\u2019s a cancellation, a push notification\u2014\u201cNew Table\nAlert\u201d\u2014is sent to everyone on the Notify list for that night. The table goes\nto whoever claims it first on the app. Curious, I added my name to the Notify\nlist at every fully booked restaurant in my neighborhood, over a six-week\nperiod. I didn\u2019t get a single e-mail or notification.\n\nI thought I just had bad luck, until a conversation with Resy\u2019s C.E.O., Pablo\nRivero, clarified things. Over dinner at Txikito, a buzzy Basque restaurant in\nChelsea, he explained that I would likely always be near the bottom of the\nNotify queue. After American Express acquired Resy, in 2019, anyone with a\nfancy Amex card\u2014Centurion, Platinum, Reserve, or Aspire\u2014has an advantage. If\nyou have one of these cards (Centurion: ten-thousand-dollar initiation fee,\nfive thousand dollars per year), Rivero said, \u201cYou will get a Resy\nnotification before other people do.\u201d (He also said, somewhat puzzlingly,\n\u201cWhat we are trying to do is, honestly, democratize dining a bit more.\u201d)\n\nSome restaurants sort their virtual waiting lists themselves, without help\nfrom Amex. These managers cherry-pick V.I.P.s and regulars from their Notify\nqueues. SevenRooms, Resy\u2019s newest competitor, has a tool that has largely\nautomated that process: an algorithm picks which diners get priority push\nnotifications about late openings. The criteria include how often a diner\nvisits, how big his or her tabs are, how much wine and dessert are ordered,\nand tip size.\n\nJoel Montaniel, SevenRooms\u2019 C.E.O., told me, \u201cIt\u2019s the system that\u2019s\nautomatically tagging and segmenting people, because we know the human mind is\ngenerally limited, and not every customer is going to get caught and tagged\nappropriately.\u201d (Restaurateurs can also input guest notes manually.)\nSevenRooms scans customers\u2019 bills, tracks referrals, and monitors guests\u2019\nonline reviews; people who frequently cancel or no-show can be required to\nprovide a credit-card deposit. In January, the percentage of restaurants on\nResy that charged cancellation fees had grown more than fourfold from pre-\npandemic levels.\n\nRestaurants also want to know about your guests. Debby Soo, the C.E.O. of\nOpenTable, told me, \u201cIt\u2019s not just the person who booked. If there are four\npeople, they want to know all four of those people.\u201d Diner profiles and guest\nnotes are useful for deciding who lands a table and also where to seat\npeople\u2014Siberia or a cozy booth? (A new startup, Tablz, offers diners the\nopportunity to pay between five and a hundred dollars to reserve their\nfavorite tables at select New York restaurants.)\n\nAt Polo Bar, Leventhal had talked a lot about the challenge that restaurants\nface in deciding who to let in the door: \u201cWe need restaurants to be\ndemocratic,\u201d he said (a sentiment I heard over and over). \u201cBut they can\u2019t\nbe\u2014in order for them to be sustainable. The margins are so thin, and there\u2019s\nnot enough room for everyone.\u201d That\u2019s why restaurants like to identify and\nreward V.I.P. and regular customers. If a restaurant deems you important\nenough\u2014and decides to label you as a \u201cV.I.P.,\u201d \u201cP.P.X.,\u201d (personne\nparticuli\u00e8rement extraordinaire), \u201creg,\u201d \u201c$$$$\u201d or \u201csoi\u201d (short for soign\u00e9) on\nits in-house system\u2014you might notice a little gold-and-black crown emoji and\nmore available tables next time you sign in to Resy.\n\n\u201cGood operators know the best practice is saying yes, but how do you say yes\nwhile maximizing revenue?\u201d Leventhal said. \u201cIt\u2019s about saying yes to the\nperson who\u2019s going to spend the most money over the long haul.\u201d\n\nMoudime, the Polo Bar ma\u00eetre d\u2019, agreed\u2014to a point. \u201cCheck average is good.\nBut it\u2019s not everything,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got your big wine spenders, but do\nthey come every night? No. Does a celebrity come every night? No! A restaurant\nworks by an everyday person coming regularly.\u201d\n\nYour Resy, OpenTable, and SevenRooms profiles follow you around town, like\nUber reviews, or chlamydia. If you ordered a bottle of 1968 Mastroberardino\nTaurasi at Carbone, the staff at Major Food Group\u2019s dozens of affiliated\nrestaurants\u2014Dirty French, ZZ\u2019s Club\u2014can find out and fuss over you\naccordingly.\n\nGuest data is not shared between restaurants with different owners, but\nplatforms like SevenRooms and Blackbird want to change that. SevenRooms\u2019\nMontaniel envisions partnerships between restaurant groups to \u201cmake the world\na private member club for everyone.\u201d Leventhal\u2019s solution, at Blackbird, is to\nreward diners with something like frequent-flier points, which can be redeemed\nfor cocktails and appetizers at any participating restaurant. (Blackbird\u2019s\nslogan: \u201cBe a regular, everywhere.\u201d) The company, which uses blockchain\ntechnology, charges a fee to participating restaurants and some member diners,\nand publishes an insiderish newsletter called \u201cThe Supersonic.\u201d\n\nThe desire to amass data on diners is one reason that restaurateurs hate the\nresale sites. When you buy a reservation from Cita or Appointment Trader, you\nhave to give the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 a fake name to claim your table. How does Polo Bar\nknow to give you a complimentary Martini, or what your water preference or\nfood allergies might be, when they don\u2019t even know your real name? (In\nJanuary, 4 Charles e-mailed one diner whom it suspected of dealing in bot-\nacquired reservations, \u201cWe will require photo I.D.\u201d)\n\nThis kind of protocol risks making diners feel like they\u2019re in a\nT.S.A.-screening line. Restaurants don\u2019t like it either. \u201cIt\u2019s bad for\nbusiness,\u201d Eric Ripert, at Le Bernardin, told me. \u201cEvery day, we spend hours\ntrying to track down the bots and the fake reservations. Last week, we caught\neight fake reservations.\u201d Unusual e-mail addresses and disconnected phone\nlines are a dead giveaway; reservationists always call or text to confirm. He\nwent on, \u201cIf you have tables that are no-shows, the profit of the night is\ndone. So, we cannot lose reservations!\u201d\n\nAccording to the market-research firm IBISWorld, over the last decade, profit\nmargins at American restaurants have languished at around four per cent.\nGitnux, another research firm, reported that high-end restaurants may only see\nmargins of two per cent. Ripert laughed and said, \u201cClients shouldn\u2019t know we\nhave slim margins. They should come here, have an experience, and leave very\nhappy.\u201d Other restaurateurs told me they wished their diners understood that\nevery minute a restaurant is open is money earned or money lost; four out of\nfive restaurants close within five years. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly bleeding money,\u201d\nJenn Saesue, of the perennially booked Bangkok Supper Club, told me. \u201cI\nbasically have a small army,\u201d she said, of her hundred and twenty-eight\nemployees. \u201cThese people are relying on us.\u201d\n\nWhen resellers offer reservations online, they\u2019re gambling that people will\nbuy them: three hundred and twenty dollars for a four-o\u2019clock Monday table at\nVia Carota (risky); four hundred and eighty bucks for a table at Semma on a\nFriday night (an almost sure bet). When the reservations go unsold, it\u2019s the\nrestaurant that loses.\n\nAppointment Trader\u2019s Jonas Frey told me that he penalizes resellers when they\nhave unsold listings by withholding access to the site. A nightmare reseller,\nhe said, could be a \u201cscript kiddie,\u201d who uses an army of bots to \u201cbook a\nthousand reservations with the hopes of selling fifty of them.\u201d\n\nA few hot New York restaurants have stuck with the old-school reservation\nprotocol. At Eulalie, in Tribeca, a woman answers the phone and writes your\nname in a reservation book\u2014no e-mail, no OpenTable. The best way into Frog\nClub is to write to a secret e-mail address. But it is rare these days to find\na happening restaurant that does not take reservations at all. Lucali, the\nthin-crust-pizza place in Brooklyn\u2019s Carroll Gardens, might be the most\nfamous: Jay-Z once called the pies the best in Brooklyn. Mark Iacono, who runs\nthe place, told me, \u201cIt\u2019s first come, first served. People start lining up at\ntwo o\u2019clock.\u201d By four o\u2019clock, there\u2019s a line around the block to book tables\nfor that evening; the first seating is at five. I stopped by on a chilly\nafternoon in March, at 2 P.M., and found a half-dozen people waiting. At the\nhead of the line, a cannabis-company executive named Ben Zachs said, \u201cI\u2019m\nfirst! I got here at 12:37 P.M. Today\u2019s my wife\u2019s birthday, and this is her\nfavorite restaurant.\u201d\n\nSecond in line was a woman named Alex, who had on pink sneakers and socks, and\nthird was Tim Kimura, who wore an eye patch and a black shemagh. Gigi\nPrincipe, an aspiring actress who likes to bake, was fifth. She said that she\nhoped to be first in line at Lucali\u2019s one day. \u201cIf it\u2019s a Saturday, that\u2019s\nballer\u2019s gold,\u201d she said. The line grew. A man named Baron Tremayne Caple, who\nhad on a dirty pink hoodie, had rushed over to Lucali after cleaning someone\u2019s\noffice that morning.\n\nAt 4:05 P.M., the restaurant\u2019s host, Alex Perez-Cuomo, stepped outside and\nstarted writing names and numbers in a notebook. \u201cCash only! B.Y.O.B.!\u201d she\nyelled. \u201cYou have the table for an hour. I need you all here to be seated.\u201d\nInside, Iacono sat by the window, in a white T-shirt, watching the line. \u201cIt\u2019s\njust easier,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the line\u2019s become a thing\u2014it\u2019s become part of the\nexperience.\u201d By four-forty, a hundred and fifty covers had been accounted for,\nand only a few ten-o\u2019clock tables were left.\n\nBy five o\u2019clock, the restaurant was jammed with its first wave of customers,\nwho were excitedly considering what toppings to order\u2014mushrooms, sweet\npeppers, pepperoni. The man with the eye patch, Kimura, wasn\u2019t among them.\nNeither was Alex or Gigi Principe. It turned out that they were all employees\nof the same line-sitting company, called Same Ole Line Dudes. \u201cI\u2019ve been\ncalled here to wait at least a hundred times,\u201d Kimura had told me. The going\nrate for an afternoon in line at Lucali is fifty-five dollars, a percentage of\nwhich goes to the company. Baron Tremayne Caple wasn\u2019t ordering pizza either.\nHis table had gone, for a hundred and twenty dollars, to a person named Robin,\nwho\u2019d hired him on TaskRabbit. \u2666\n\n## The 2024 Food Issue\n\nA digital-only issue about the culinary world.\n\n  * Padma Lakshmi walks into a bar.\n\n  * The most treasured jar in Ina Garten\u2019s pantry.\n\n  * The kitchen guides that New Yorker writers and editors can\u2019t do without.\n\n  * Photo Booth: When babies rule the dinner table.\n\n  * A crossword puzzle for foodies.\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New\nYorker.\n\nAdam Iscoe is a writer based in New York City.\n\nMore:RestaurantsReservationsAppsGig EconomyFine Dining\n\n### Daily\n\nOur flagship newsletter highlights the best of The New Yorker, including top\nstories, fiction, humor, and podcasts.\n\nRead More\n\nAnnals of Gastronomy\n\nA Martini Tour of New York City\n\nMy month of vermouth-rinsing and fat-washing.\n\nBy Gary Shteyngart\n\nOur Local Correspondents\n\nWaking Up to a New York City Earthquake\n\nAfter the most powerful quake in more than a century, the city was full of\nstories, arm-waving, and whispers of California.\n\nBy Sarah Larson\n\nShouts & Murmurs\n\nIdeas for the New York City Officials Implementing Rat Birth Control\n\nEncourage male rats to recount the plots of \u201cDune\u201d and \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d on\nfirst dates.\n\nBy Meg Richardson\n\nSketchbook\n\nOverheard in New York: Waiting for the Eclipse at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a flat-earther.\u201d\n\nBy Anjali Chandrashekar\n\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
