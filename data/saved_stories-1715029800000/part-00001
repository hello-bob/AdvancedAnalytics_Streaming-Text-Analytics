Typically sourced from ships (either as part of\nregular scrapping or shipwrecks) and other steel artifacts of this era, it is\noften used for modern particle detectors because more modern steel is\ncontaminated with traces of nuclear fallout.^[3]^[4]\n\n## Steel[edit]\n\nSince the end of atmospheric nuclear testing, background radiation has\ndecreased to very near natural levels,^[5] making special low-background steel\nno longer necessary for most radiation-sensitive uses, as brand-new steel now\nhas a low enough radioactive signature that it can generally be used.^[6] Some\ndemand remains for the most radiation-sensitive uses, such as Geiger counters\nand sensing equipment aboard spacecraft. For the most demanding items even\nlow-background steel can be too radioactive and other materials like high-\npurity copper may be used.^[4]\n\nIn cases where World War II-era shipwrecks in and near the relatively shallow\nJava Sea and western South China Sea have been illegally scavenged, it has\nbeen suggested that the target is low-background steel.^[7] Andrew Brockman, a\nmaritime crime researcher and archaeologist, argues that it is more likely to\nbe conventional salvage.^[8]\n\n## Radionuclide contamination[edit]\n\nFrom 1856 until the mid 20th century, steel was produced in the Bessemer\nprocess, where air was forced into Bessemer converters converting the pig iron\ninto steel. By the mid-20th century, many steelworks had switched to the BOS\nprocess, which uses pure oxygen instead of air. However, as both processes use\natmospheric gas, they are susceptible to contamination from airborne\nparticulates. Present-day air carries radionuclides, such as cobalt-60, which\nare deposited into the steel, giving it a weak radioactive signature.^[6]\nAnother source of radioactive contamination was the coating of steel cauldrons\nin cobalt-60 in order to monitor wear.^[8] Steel that would otherwise be\nexpected to be low-background can itself be contaminated due to thorium in\nwelding rods.^[4]\n\nWorld anthropogenic background radiation levels peaked at 0.11 mSv/yr above\nnatural levels in 1963, the year that the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was\nenacted. Since then, by about 2008, anthropogenic background radiation has\ndecreased to 0.005 mSv/yr above natural levels.^[5]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Manohari, M.; Mathiyarasu, R.; Rajagopal, V.; Meenakshisundaram, V.; Indira, R.
