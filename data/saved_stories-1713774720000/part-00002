(Courtesy: Cheeseworks for QuTech)\n\nResearchers at the Dutch quantum institute QuTech in Delft have announced\nplans to build Europe\u2019s first 100-quantum bit (qubit) quantum computer. When\ncomplete in 2026, the device will be made publicly available, providing\nscientists with a tool for quantum calculations and simulations.\n\nThe project is funded by the Dutch umbrella organization Quantum Delta NL via\nthe European OpenSuperQPlus initiative, which has 28 partners from 10\ncountries. Part of the 10-year, \u20ac1bn European Quantum Flagship programme,\nOpenSuperQPlus aims to build a 100-qubit superconducting quantum processor as\na stepping stone to an eventual 1000-qubit European quantum computer.\n\nQuTech was set up in 2015 by Delft University of Technology (TUD) and the\nNetherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO). It has spawned\nnumerous spin-off firms, with the chips being developed by QuantWare,\ncryogenic cabling from Delft Circuits, control software from Qblox, and\nsoftware from Orange Quantum Systems. TNO will work on the web interfaces and\nTUD will integrate the various systems.\n\nRead more\n\n####\n\nMEPs call for \u2018urgent action\u2019 to implement post-quantum encryption standards\n\nQuantum Delta NL says the 100-qubit quantum computer will be made publicly\navailable via a cloud platform as an extension of the existing platform\nQuantum Inspire that first came online in 2020. It currently includes a two-\nqubit processor of spin qubits in silicon, as well as a five-qubit processor\nbased on superconducting qubits.\n\nQuantum Inspire is currently focused on training and education but the upgrade\nto 100 qubits is expected to allow research into quantum computing. Lead\nresearcher from QuTech Leonardo DiCarlo believes the R&D cycle has \u201ccome full\ncircle\u201d, where academic research first enabled spin-off companies to grow and\nnow their products are being used to accelerate academic research.\n\nMartijn Boerkamp is a science writer based in the Netherlands\n\n### Quantum newsletter\n\nSign up today for our bimonthly newsletter\n\nRead previous\n\n  * Astronomy and space\n  * News\n\n#### US astronomers slam cuts to the Chandra X-ray observatory\n\nRead next\n\n  * Projects and facilities\n  * News\n\n#### US Electron-Ion Collider hits construction milestone\n\n## Discover more from Physics World\n\n    * Quantum computing\n    * Opinion and reviews\n\n### Why error correction is quantum computing\u2019s defining challenge\n\n    * Magnetism and spin\n    * Research update\n\n### Quantum Barkhausen noise detected for the first time\n\n    * Quantum\n    * Interview\n\n### Mauro Paternostro: a vision of the quantum landscape\n\n## Related jobs\n\n  * United Kingdom | QinetiQ\n\n#### Senior Quantum Scientist\n\n  * Germany | Karlsruhe Institute of Technology\n\n#### University Professorship (W3) \"Quantum Materials\"\n\n  * Broomfield | Quantinuum US\n\n#### Principle Physicist\n\n## Related events\n\n  * Quantum | Conference IQT The Hague 22\u201424 April 2024 | The Hague, Netherlands\n  * Quantum | Conference Quantum.Tech USA 24\u201426 April 2024 | Washington DC, US\n  * Quantum | Conference IQT Vancouver-Pacific Rim 4\u20146 June 2024 | Vancouver, Canada\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 by IOP Publishing Ltd and individual contributors\n\n#### Explore Physics World\n\n  * About us\n  * Our team\n  * Our portfolio\n  * Advertising\n  * Contact us\n  * Feedback\n  * Sign in\n  * Register\n\n#### MORE INFORMATION\n\n  * Institute of Physics\n  * Join the Institute\n  * Modern Slavery Act\n  * Privacy and Cookies\n  * IOP Publishing\n  * Copyright\n  * Terms and Conditions\n  * Disclaimer\n\n#### OUR MISSION\n\nPhysics World represents a key part of IOP Publishing's mission to communicate\nworld-class research and innovation to the widest possible audience.
