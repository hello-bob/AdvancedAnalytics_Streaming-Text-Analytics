It is a way to increase\nthe ratio of memory-safe code into a libcurl build.\n\nhyper support remains experimental to this day because we still have fifteen\ntest disabled for it. Meaning that we still lack the proper adjustments in\ncurl to make it on par with the native HTTP backend.\n\nWe even recently had to back-pedal and remove support for HTTP/2 when hyper is\nused because of how we (I) had misunderstood their API and how to properly\nintegrate HTTP/2 support into curl.\n\nFor the last six months, the only changes done in curl's hyper code have been\nfixes to make it keep up with refactors and other internal cleanups and\nimprovements. No one seems to (want to) work on improving curl's hyper backend\nand no one seems to use it or care about its lack of HTTP/2 support.\n\nSome 40 months after initial merge, we seem to be at a stand-still and yet\nthings like [1] happens that require attention and work. Is hyper support now\njust a dead weight that adds friction when we want to innovate and improve?\n\nI added \"drop Hyper support?\" as a conversion topic for curl up 2024.\n\nThoughts?\n\n[1] = https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/13380\n\n    \n    \n    -- / daniel.haxx.se | Commercial curl support up to 24x7 is available! | Private help, bug fixes, support, ports, new features | https://curl.se/support.html -- Unsubscribe: https://lists.haxx.se/mailman/listinfo/curl-library Etiquette: https://curl.se/mail/etiquette.html\n\nReceived on 2024-04-16\n\n", "frontpage": false}
