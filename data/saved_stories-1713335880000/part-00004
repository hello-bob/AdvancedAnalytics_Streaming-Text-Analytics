Free! Learn more\n\n## The \"classical problem\"\n\nOnline music is here to stay. But, like most platforms, Spotify was designed\nfor popular music, based on singers, albums and, specially, tracks. Classical\nmusic demands a very different approach: it is based on composers, works,\nperformers (a plenty of them) and movements. Concertmaster brings the complex\nstructure of classical music to Spotify. It combines composers and works info\nfrom the Open Opus library with automated analysis of the Spotify metadata.\nThe result? A free, open app that makes Spotify and classical music work\ntogether, at last.\n\n## Designed for classical music\n\nSay goodbye to tracks and welcome multi-movement works!\n\n### Search, finally working for classical\n\nSearch for recordings, not for albums or tracks: look for composers, works,\nperformers or any combination of those.\n\n### Composers, works and much more\n\nBrowse 200+ composers and tens of thousands of works, conveniently organised:\nA to Z, popular, essential, by genre, by period. Set favorite composers and\nworks and browse directly to them.\n\n### No-nonsense radio stations\n\nThe typical classical music online radio is pure chaos: the \"sacrificial\ndance\" from \"The Rite of Spring\", one prelude from \"The Well-Tempered\nClavier\", then a slow movement from some Mozart piano concerto... stop this\nerratic movement swapping and embrace a classical radio that makes sense: only\ncomplete works and fully programmable.\n\n### Credits go all to the artists\n\nNo more guessing games: each recording presents full credits of its\nperformers: orchestras, conductors, soloists, singers, chamber groups...\n\n### 1, 2, 3, easy as A-B-C\n\nAlbums and tracks are convenient for popular music but not suitable at all for\nclassical music and its large, fragmented works. Say hi to a classical music\nplayer designed for multi-movement sets, that presents both a detailed view of\neach movement and a global progress bar of the work as a whole.\n\n### Playlists galore!\n\nOrganize recordings by setting them favorites or by creating playlists, which\ncan be played randomically as a radio station.\n\n### Quality control\n\nConcertmaster has both automated and crowdsourced filters to eliminate bad and\nincomplete recordings from the library.\n\n## Easy, free and open\n\nConcertmaster runs on phones, tablets and computers and is completely free to\nuse. Enjoy!\n\nPlease note that Concertmaster itself is free but actual playback requires a\nSpotify subscription.\n\n## Available everywhere\n\niPhone, iPad? Download our app! Android, computers? Use our web version!\n\n## iPhone\n\niPhone 6S and beyond, iOS 13+ required\n\n## iPad\n\niPad Air 2 and beyond, iOS 13+ required\n\n## Computers and Android phones\n\nOur web app runs on any computer or Android phone\n\n## Keep us alive!\n\nConcertmaster is a completely free and open project based on our love for\nclassical music. You can help us in several ways: donating money for our\nserver costs, reviewing our content and, if you are a software developer,\ncontributing with code.\n\n### Help with our bills\n\nConcertmaster is free to use but it runs on web servers that cost us money.\nYou can help us by supporting us on Patreon - any amount is more than welcome\nand supporters get early access to new versions!\n\n### Help with our content\n\nConcertmaster tries to retrieve all the information it needs from the Spotify\ndatabase, but sometimes this isn't enough. You can help us by submitting\nperformers and recording data or even by simply validating them. It's done\ndirectly on the player and it's very easy!\n\n### Help with our code\n\nConcertmaster is open source software. This means that you can not only see\nhow it was made but contribute yourself with code! Bug fixes and new features\nimplementation are always needed. And, of course, you can fork Concertmaster's\ncode and create your own software - why not?\n\n### Help with our data\n\nConcertmaster composers and works information come from Open Opus, a free,\nwiki-style, open source database of classical music metadata. You can review\nexisting info or add new entries to the database - any help will be\nappreciated!\n\n## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\n### Is Concertmaster a standalone service? Do I have to subscribe?\n\nConcertmaster is just a Spotify front-end and it is completely free of charge.\nBut, since the music itself will be streamed directly from Spotify, you'll\nneed a Spotify Premium subscription.\n\n### I'm a subscriber to another music service. Does Concertmaster work for me?\n\nConcertmaster works only with Spotify! Please note that Concertmaster is open\nsource software, so anybody can create versions of it for other services!\n\n### Only 220 composers? Where are composers such as X, Y and Z?\n\nThe Concertmaster database comes from Open Opus, a recently released classical\nmusic metadata repository. It's beginning with a limited set of composers;\nit'll gradually grow and become more comprehensive. But you can search for any\ncomposer or work present on the Spotify catalogue, even if they aren't on\nConcertmaster listings.\n\n### How does Concertmaster work?\n\nConcertmaster relies on Open Opus, a free and open database of composers and\nworks, and on its own algorithm, which fetches and analyzes Spotify data. Yes,\nSpotify already has almost all data the classical listener needs; but its pop-\noriented player can't present them accordingly. Concertmaster can!\n\n### Why can't I install Concertmaster on my older iPhone/iPad?\n\nConcertmaster uses Apple libraries that require iOS 13 or superior, available\nonly for iPhone 6S, iPad Air 2 and beyond. (We're sorry for that restriction.\nBut, as a matter of fact, the iPhone 6S is a 2015 device and Concertmaster\nruns pretty well on it.)\n\n### Is it safe to give my Spotify credentials to Concertmaster?\n\nYes, completely safe. In fact, no credentials at all are passed to\nConcertmaster. The entire log in process happens directly on Spotify's\nservers. (Or even in the Spotify app itself.) Concertmaster is not a \"hack\".\nIt uses technology created and endorsed by Spotify themselves.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Open Opus 2021.
