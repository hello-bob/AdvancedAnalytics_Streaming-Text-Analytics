Curiously, just a week or so later, Google\nofficially announced it was shutting down the service on June 10, 2024.\n\nHowever, VPN (Virtual Private Network) problems are not isolated to third-\nparty causes. Multiple times in the past, Windows updates have broken VPN\nsettings, leading to connection failures and slow speeds, among other\nproblems. Thankfully, Microsoft has also managed to fix such problems, even\nfor preview builds for Insider channels.\n\nThe latest Patch Tuesday updates for Windows 11 (KB5036893), Windows 10\n(KB5036892) as well as Windows Server, have VPN issues, the company has\nconfirmed. The issue was posted on the Windows health dashboard.\n\nThis is outside of the several problems we have already reported about in a\ndedicated article, as well as the profile picture bug.\n\nOn the dashboard, Microsoft has explained the issue as well as how the Get\nHelp app may be able to help affected users on Client. It does not, however,\ngo too much into the details of what is causing the problems. Perhaps the\ncompany needs more time for that:\n\n> Windows devices might face VPN connection failures after installing the\n> April 2024 security update or the April 2024 non-security preview update.\n>\n> Next steps: We are working on a resolution and will provide an update in an\n> upcoming release.\n>\n> Windows support:\n>\n> Home PC: If you need support with your personal or family account, use the\n> Get help app in Windows.\n>\n> Enterprise devices: Request help for your organization through Support for\n> business.\n>\n> Affected platforms:\n>\n> Client: Windows 11, version 23H2; Windows 11, version 22H2, Windows 11,\n> version 21H2, Windows 10, version 22H2, Windows 10, version 21H2.\n>\n> Server: Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016,\n> Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows\n> Server 2008.\n\nYou may find more details about it on this page on the Windows health\ndashboard.\n\n#### Tags\n\n  * Microsoft\n  * Windows 11\n  * Windows 10\n  * Vpn issues\n  * Patch tuesday\n  * Windows bugs\n  * Windows bug\n  * Windows 11 bugs\n  * Windows 11 issues\n  * Windows 10 bugs\n  * Windows 10 bug\n\nLike\n\nPost\n\nShare\n\nReport a problem with article\n\nNext Article\n\n### \"65000\" BitLocker bug on Windows 11 and 10 was finally fixed, Microsoft\nconfirms\n\nPrevious Article\n\n### Samsung might be ditching the Galaxy Watch 7 Pro and bringing the Galaxy\nWatch Ultra\n\n### Related Stories\n\n### Microsoft: Windows Copilot app we quietly installed is harmless and\ndoesn't steal your data\n\nSayan Sen \u00b7 Apr 17, 2024 with 18 comment s\n\n### Windows 11 (KB5036893), Windows 10 (KB5036892) cause slow PCs, 0x8007000d,\n0x800705b9 errors\n\nSayan Sen \u00b7 Apr 13, 2024 with 8 comment s\n\n### Microsoft: We are working on KB5034441/KB5034440 \"0x80070643 -\nERROR_INSTALL_FAILURE\" fix\n\nSayan Sen \u00b7 Jan 15, 2024 with 19 comment s\n\n### Microsoft acknowledges it's not HP who's auto-installing printer Smart app\non your Windows\n\nSayan Sen \u00b7 Dec 8, 2023 with 12 comment s\n\nFrom the WebPowered by ZergNet\n\nThe Most Inbred People In History Are Hard To Look At\n\nIf Hitler Had Won WW2, These Were His Plans For The US\n\nThese Video Game Theories Are Unbelievable & We Love Them\n\nVideo Games You Really Shouldn't Be Caught Playing By Your Kids\n\n### Subscribe to our Newsletter\n\n### Community Activity\n\nRefresh\n\n  * 19,000 Posts in Member Milestones\n  * Acronyms.... in Jokes & Funny Stuff\n  * Wifi via cell phone really slow in Smart Home, Network & Security\n  * \"Dominion of Darkness\" - narrative driven RPG/strategy simulator of the Dark Lord/Lady in PC Gaming\n  * Tesla Cybertruck in The Neobahn\n  * Deadpool & Wolverine (2024) in The Media Room\n\n### Software Stories\n\n### FastCopy 5.7.7\n\n### Fan Control V188\n\n### Google Chrome 124.0.6367.119 (offline installer)\n\n### ExplorerPatcher 22621.3527.65.2\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n### Windows 10 reaches 70% market share as Windows 11 keeps declining\n\n### The Arc browser is now publicly available on Windows 11\n\n### We tested AceMagic, Beelink, and Geekom Mini PCs with several anti-malware\nprograms\n\n### Just a day after Voyager's resurrection NASA got into trouble with another\niconic spacecraft\n\n### Join the conversation!\n\nLogin or Sign Up to read and post a comment.\n\n## 0 Comments - Add comment\n\n### Report Comment\n\nClose\n\nPlease enter your reason for reporting this comment.\n\nreview\n\n### Acemagic F2A review: Intel Core Ultra AI Mini PC with Wi-Fi 7, a world\nfirst?\n\nacemagic f2a\n\nThis Week in Rocket Launches #162\n\n### China set to launch sample return mission to the Moon\n\ntwirl\n\nreview\n\n### EasySMX X10 Mechanic Master - An inexpensive yet high spec cross-platform\ngames controller\n\neasysmx\n\nreview\n\n### Review: Edifier QR65 active speakers with infinity mirrors - To infinity\nand beyond!\n\nedifier qr65\n\nBeta Channel\n\n### Windows 11 build 22635.3566 has the \"Show desktop\u201d button\n\nwindows 11 insider preview promo\n\nEditorial\n\n### Forget Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, what you really want to download this month is\nFedora Silverblue 40\n\nfedora silverblue\n\nCanary Channel\n\n### Windows 11 26200 adds Widgets improvements and more\n\nwindows 11 insider preview\n\nreview\n\n### TerraMaster D8 Hybrid DAS review: 8-bays of up to 128TB SSD + HDD storage\n\nterramaster hybrid d8\n\nguide\n\n### Reinstall Windows 11 without losing your data using Windows Update\n\nmicrosoft\n\nreview\n\n### Edifier NeoBuds Pro 2: Superb audio in a premium package, crap battery\nlife\n\nedifier\n\nreview\n\n### Dangbei Atom HDR10/HLG, an laser projector with Dolby sound, Google TV,\nChromecast, and more\n\ndangbei\n\nreview\n\n### Gulikit KK3 Max premium with refined performance almost all the time\n\ngulikit\n\n### Company\n\n  * Contact Us\n  * About Us\n  * Write for Neowin\n  * Advertising\n\n### Community\n\n  * Forums\n  * Subscribe\n  * Chat on IRC\n  * Neowin Deals\n\n### Social\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * YouTube\n  * Mastodon\n  * RSS\n\n### Partners\n\n  * Star Control\n  * Fences\n  * Brad Wardell\n  * Store\n\n  * DMCA Policy \u00b7\n  * Terms of Use \u00b7\n  * Privacy Statement\n\n\u00a9 Since 2000 Neowin\u00ae All trademarks mentioned are the property of their\nrespective owners.\n\nTop of Page\n\nLoading\n\n", "frontpage": false}
