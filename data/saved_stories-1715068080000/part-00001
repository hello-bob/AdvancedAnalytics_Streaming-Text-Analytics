Your profile can be used (also later) to present\nadvertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by\nthis and other entities.\n\nIf you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this\ninformation could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike\naccessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a\ndifferent website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike\naccessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury\ncar manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your\ninterest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are\ninterested in luxury cycling gear.\n\nAn apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes.

The planned launch for Monday night was called\noff at 8:34 p.m. Eastern because of a problem with a propellant valve in the\nsecond stage of the Atlas V rocket that was to lift the crew to orbit.\n\nIt is not yet known if the problem can be easily fixed at the launchpad. If it\ncan be, there is another launch opportunity on Tuesday night. A news\nconference is expected later this evening, but NASA has not yet announced when\nit will take place.\n\nThe space agency retired its space shuttles in 2011. For nine years,\nastronauts could get to the International Space Station only aboard Russia\u2019s\nSoyuz rockets. Then in May 2020, two NASA astronauts, Bob Behnken and Doug\nHurley, flew to the I.S.S. in SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon. That capsule has since\nbecome the only way to get to orbit from the United States.\n\nDuring this time, NASA has been waiting on a second vehicle to be ready. That\nwas Starliner, built by the aerospace giant Boeing, and it finally seemed set\nto launch on its first test flight with astronauts on board after years of\ntechnical setbacks and costly delays. Here\u2019s what you need to know about\nMonday evening\u2019s scrubbed launch attempt:\n\n  * The rocket and spacecraft had been scheduled to lift off at 10:34 p.m. Eastern time from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.\n\n  * Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, the two NASA astronauts on this test flight, had already entered Starliner and were in the process of being strapped in to their seats aboard the capsule when the launch attempt was called off. They then retraced their steps \u2014 getting out of the Starliner and taking a van ride back to crew quarters at NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center.\n\n  * Starliner had what is known as an instantaneous launch window \u2014 it must launch on time to allow it to catch up with the International Space Station passing above. If the problem with the rocket can be resolved quickly, the mission could launch on Tuesday night. There are additional opportunities on May 10 and May 11.\n\n  * Mr. Wilmore, the commander, and Ms. Williams, the pilot, are experienced NASA astronauts, with Mr. Wilmore having spent 167 days in space, and Ms. Williams 322 days there.\n\n  * Starliner is years behind schedule, a result of work by Boeing and NASA to confirm that the spacecraft was safe to fly that stretched far longer than either had expected. Technical pitfalls included inadequate software testing, corroded propellant valves, flammable tape and a key component in parachute system that turned out to be weaker than designed. Boeing fixed the problems, and it was finally ready to launch.\n\n  * There have been many problems with Starliner, but Monday\u2019s scrubbed flight resulted from an issue with the rocket, not Boeing\u2019s space capsule. The Atlas V is operated by United Launch Alliance, which earlier noted that this was to be the 100th flight of the rocket.\n\n  * Starliner\u2019s delays have left Boeing facing more than $1.4 billion in unexpected charges. The launch attempt comes during a tough 2024 for the aerospace giant. Just days into the year, a panel on the body of a Boeing 737 Max 9 blew off during an Alaska Airlines flight. The pilots were able to safely land the plane, and there were no major injuries, but the episode has had widespread repercussions for the company, particularly its aviation division.\n\nNiraj Chokshi contributed reporting.\n\nMay 6, 2024, 9:33 p.m. ET1 hour ago\n\n1 hour ago\n\nMichael Roston\n\nEditing spaceflight news.\n\nNASA has concluded their live broadcast for the evening.

In 2014, NASA awarded contracts to Boeing\nand SpaceX to transport astronauts to the International Space Station. SpaceX,\nwhich received far less funding, carried astronauts into orbit for the first\ntime in 2020. Boeing hopes to achieve that milestone on Monday.\n\nAlong the way, the aerospace giant has faced many setbacks, including years of\ndelays and more than $1.4 billion in unexpected charges. In securities\nfilings, Boeing has blamed engineering issues and supply chain problems,\nhigher-than-expected costs for development, certification and testing, and\neven a problem identified in testing by a parachute supplier.\n\n\u201cBuilding rockets and spacecraft is no trivial task,\u201d said Ron Epstein, a\nfinancial analyst at Bank of America. \u201cIt\u2019s just taken Boeing longer and cost\nthem more to do than they thought.\u201d\n\nThe setbacks underscore a broader frustration for Boeing\u2019s defense and space\nbusiness: Fixed-price contracts, under which contractors bear responsibility\nfor higher-than-expected costs. Under a cost-plus contract, on the other hand,\nthe government is responsible for covering unexpected expenses.\n\nFixed-price contracts are financially risky for companies if costs rise or\ndelays materialize \u2014 and Boeing has struggled under them in recent years. Such\ncontracts accounted for about 58 percent of the revenues coming into the\ndefense and space unit last year and the company has said that it is working\nto limit its reliance on them. (SpaceX, by contrast, has thrived on fixed-\nprice contracts.)\n\n\u201cWe have a couple of fixed-price development programs we have to just finish\nand never do them again,\u201d Dave Calhoun, Boeing\u2019s chief executive, said at an\ninvestor conference last summer. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work for us and it doesn\u2019t work\nfor our customers, in my not-so-humble opinion.\u201d\n\nAlthough the company has faced delays, a Boeing representative said in a\nstatement that the company remains, \u201ccommitted to providing NASA with a crew\naccess capability to low Earth orbit and that it \u201cwill continue to fulfill our\ncontractual obligations.\u201d\n\nMay 6, 2024, 8:36 p.m. ET2 hours ago\n\n2 hours ago\n\nKenneth Chang\n\nReporting from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nThe launch tonight has been scrubbed because of a problem with an oxygen\nvalve.

Rockets have traditionally been fueled before astronauts\nboard to avoid danger to the astronauts during that process. But SpaceX does\nthe opposite for its Crew Dragon missions; propellants flow into the Falcon 9\ntanks close to the launch time, after astronauts are already strapped in. That\nallows the propellants to be chilled colder, increasing the density and the\namount of propellant. SpaceX believes this is just as safe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nMay 6, 2024, 8:13 p.m. ET3 hours ago\n\n3 hours ago\n\nMichael Roston\n\nEditing spaceflight news.\n\nSuni Williams, the pilot of the Starliner flight to the space station, has\nboarded the capsule and is getting situated in her seat with the help of\nBoeing technicians.

The pilots were able to safely land the plane and\nthere were no major injuries, but the episode has had widespread repercussions\nfor the company.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration grounded all Max 9 jets within the United\nStates for about three weeks, a headache for Alaska and United Airlines, which\nrely on the plane. The agency also immediately increased its scrutiny of\nBoeing and limited the rate at which the company can build the Max at its\nSeattle-area factory.\n\nOn Monday, the F.A.A. said it had opened a new investigation into the company\nafter learning from Boeing that it may have skipped some required inspections\ninvolving the wings of 787 Dreamliner jets.\n\nSince the Alaska Airlines incident, Boeing has taken steps to assure\nregulators and the public of the quality of its planes by stepping up\ninspections, expanding training and taking other measures. The company has\nsince shaken up its leadership: The chairman of its board stepped down and its\nchief executive said he would leave by the end of the year.\n\nThe company is also in talks to buy Spirit AeroSystems, a troubled supplier\nthat makes the body of the Max, and which had been a part of Boeing until it\nwas spun off two decades ago.\n\nThe episode further damaged Boeing\u2019s reputation after two fatal crashes, in\n2018 and 2019, of Max 8 planes, a smaller variant of the 737 Max 9, in which\n346 people died. The Max had been banned globally for nearly two years after\nthose crashes. But from late 2020 when flight resumed up until this year, it\nhad enjoyed a relatively smooth run.\n\nMuch of the fallout has been limited to Boeing\u2019s commercial planes business,\nwhich is distinct from the company\u2019s other two divisions: One that makes\nmilitary aircraft, missiles, satellites, spacecraft and rockets, and another\nthat provides maintenance and services to the company\u2019s customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nMay 6, 2024, 7:46 p.m. ET3 hours ago\n\n3 hours ago\n\nKenneth Chang\n\nReporting from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nButch Wilmore and Suni Williams reached the launchpad, took the elevator up\nthe launch tower and are entering the Starliner capsule with the help of\ntechnicians after the two astronauts had a brief huddle with their assisting\ncrew.

Elon Musk says no.\n\nImage\n\nThe SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule approaching the International Space Station for\ndocking in 2021.Credit...NASA, via Associated Press\n\nFour years ago, SpaceX flew its equivalent of this week\u2019s Starliner mission \u2014\nthe first launch of the company\u2019s Crew Dragon spacecraft with two NASA\nastronauts aboard.\n\nThe agency celebrated loudly as the flight ended NASA\u2019s nearly decade-long\ndependence on Russia\u2019s Soyuz rocket to send astronauts to orbit. In part, that\nhas made the debut of Starliner on Monday night almost like an afterthought,\nwith Boeing seemingly light-years behind SpaceX.\n\nIndeed, on Monday, before Starliner\u2019s launch, Elon Musk, the founder of\nSpaceX, posted on his social media site, X, \u201cThe world doesn\u2019t need another\ncapsule.\u201d\n\nIn a separate posting, Mr. Musk sharply criticized Boeing. \u201cAlthough Boeing\ngot $4.2 billion to develop an astronaut capsule and SpaceX only got $2.6\nbillion, SpaceX finished 4 years sooner,\u201d he wrote. \u201cToo many non-technical\nmanagers at Boeing.\u201d\n\nA Boeing spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nWhile Mr. Musk might think Starliner is superfluous, NASA officials have often\nsaid it is important to have contingency options if something goes wrong.\n\n\u201cThis will give us that additional capability because we always look for a\nbackup,\u201d Bill Nelson, the NASA administrator, said during a news conference on\nFriday.\n\nDana Weigel, program manager of the space station for NASA, gave the example\nof when a Soyuz docked at the space station suffered a coolant leak in 2022.\n\nIf the Soyuz were the only means of transportation, that could have led to a\nsituation where the lives of the astronauts were genuinely at risk. But a\nSpaceX Crew Dragon was also docked there, providing a backup.\n\n\u201cIf we had to bring the whole crew home on a SpaceX Dragon, we could have done\nthat,\u201d Ms. Weigel said.\n\nFor NASA, the more options it has, the better. If Crew Dragon or Starliner\nsuffered a failure and were grounded, the other would still be available. That\nlessens the possibility that the United States might again have to rely on\nRussians and the whims of Vladimir Putin for launching people to space.\n\n\u201cThe more dissimilar capabilities you have, the more robust you are for\ndealing with issues,\u201d Ms. Weigel said.\n\nDuring the Starliner delays, SpaceX has successfully launched nine Crew Dragon\nmissions for NAS the test flight in May 2020 followed by eight operational\nmissions that carried crews to the space station for six-month stays.\n\nSpaceX has also launched four private astronaut missions using the same Crew\nDragons. The first one, Inspiration4, was financed by Jared Isaacman, a\nbillionaire entrepreneur. While that flight went only to orbit and not to the\nI.S.S., Axiom Space of Houston has since flown three private astronaut\nmissions to the space station, with a fourth that might launch as soon as\nAugust.\n\nMr. Isaacman is also planning to return to space later this year with another\nCrew Dragon mission, called Polaris Dawn, which is aiming to include the first\nspacewalk during a commercial spaceflight.\n\nMay 6, 2024, 7:15 p.m. ET4 hours ago\n\n4 hours ago\n\nKenneth Chang\n\nReporting from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nThe astronauts have exited the building and are bidding their families and\nother well-wishers farewell before boarding the \"astro van\" that will drive\nthem to the launchpad.

She was a test pilot in the\nU.S. Navy and has more than 3,000 hours flying 30 different aircraft. She was\nselected as a NASA astronaut in 1998. She has spent 322 days in space and for\na while held the record for total time on spacewalks by a woman.\n\nMr. Wilmore, a native of Tennessee, was also a Navy test pilot, and he flew\ncombat missions over Iraq and Bosnia in the 1990s. He was selected as an\nastronaut by NASA in 2000. During his two previous missions, he spent a total\nof 167 days in space.\n\nTheir last trips to orbit were years ago.\n\nMs. Williams had two long-duration stays on the International Space Station,\nthe second ending in November 2012. Mr. Wilmore served as the pilot of a space\nshuttle mission in 2009, then spent 5 and a half months on the space station\nfrom September 2014 to March 2015.\n\nAfter a glitch-filled test flight in December 2019 with no crew aboard, delays\nshuffled the astronaut assignments. Indeed, none of the astronauts that NASA\nnamed in 2018 to fly on the test flight are on the upcoming test flight.\n\nIn 2020, Mr. Wilmore was named commander of the test flight. In 2022, Ms.\nWilliams was shifted to the test flight, serving as the pilot. (She originally\nwas assigned to serve as the commander of the second flight, the first\noperational one that would take four astronauts to the space station for six\nmonths.)\n\nNow, finally, they are about to launch.\n\nDuring the question-and-answer session, Mr. Wilmore and Ms. Williams were\nasked which space food they were looking forward to eating again.\n\n\u201cChocolate pudding cake,\u201d Mr. Wilmore answered without hesitation. \u201cThere\u2019s\nnothing left to be said.

Kennedy Space Center in Florida on April\n16.Credit...Chandan Khanna/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\n\nAt first glance, Boeing\u2019s Starliner looks much like the command module used\nduring NASA\u2019s Apollo moon missions in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThat\u2019s not a random coincidence. The ability of that cone-shaped vehicle to\nkeep astronauts safe during re-entry into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere has been well\ndocumented.\n\nAt 15 feet in diameter, Starliner is slightly bigger than the Apollo\nspacecraft. The capsule and the service module \u2014 the part of the spacecraft\nthat provides power and propulsion during the flight before being discarded\njust before landing \u2014 are together 16.5 feet in height.\n\nThe spacecraft is large enough to carry up to seven astronauts, but NASA\nmissions will carry a crew of four. Boeing has the option of selling a fifth\nseat to a private customer looking to tag along.\n\nEach Starliner is designed to be used for up to 10 missions; by contrast, a\nservice module burns up in the atmosphere, and a new one is needed for each\ntrip.\n\nBoeing has built three Starliner capsules. The first was used only to\ndemonstrate the ability to quickly fly astronauts to safety in case of an\nemergency on the launchpad. That capsule will not be used for any missions to\norbit.\n\nThe Starliner used for this mission previously flew in space in 2020 during\nthe first uncrewed test flight, which was cut short because of technical\nproblems. Sunita Williams, the pilot for this mission, has named the\nspacecraft Calypso, a nod to the research ship used by Jacques Cousteau, a\nFrench undersea explorer.\n\nThe third Starliner, still unnamed, was used for the second uncrewed test in\n2022 and will fly four astronauts to the space station for the first\noperational mission, scheduled for next year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nEnjoy unlimited access to all of The Times.\n\nSee subscription options\n\n", "frontpage": true}
