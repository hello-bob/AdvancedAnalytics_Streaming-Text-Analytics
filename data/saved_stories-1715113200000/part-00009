NIAC (NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts) has announced\nsix concepts that will receive funding and proceed to the second phase of\ndevelopment. This is always an interesting look at the technologies and\nmissions that could come to fruition in the future.\n\nThe six chosen ones will each receive $600,000 in funding to pursue the ideas\nfor the next two years. NASA expects each team to use the two years to address\nboth technical and budgetary hurdles for their concepts. When this second\nphase comes to an end, some of the concepts could advance to the third stage.\n\n\u201cThese diverse, science fiction-like concepts represent a fantastic class of\nPhase II studies,\u201d said John Nelson, NIAC program executive at NASA\nHeadquarters in Washington. \u201cOur NIAC fellows never cease to amaze and\ninspire, and this class definitely gives NASA a lot to think about in terms of\nwhat\u2019s possible in the future.\u201d\n\nHere they are.\n\nFluidic Telescope (FLUTE): Enabling the Next Generation of Large Space\nObservatories\n\nTelescopes are built around mirrors and lenses, whether they\u2019re ground-based\nor space-based. The JWST\u2019s large mirror is 6.5 meters in diameter but had to\nbe folded up to fit inside the rocket that launched it and then unfolded in\nspace. That\u2019s a tricky engineering feat. Engineers are building larger and\nlarger ground-based telescopes, too, and they\u2019re equally tricky to design and\nbuild. Could FLUTE change this?\n\nFLUTE envisions lenses made of fluid, and the FLUTE team\u2019s concept describes a\nspace telescope with a primary mirror 50 meters (164 ft.) in diameter.\nCreating glass lenses for a telescope this large isn\u2019t realistic. \u201cUsing\ncurrent technologies, scaling up space telescopes to apertures larger than\napproximately 33 feet (10 meters) in diameter does not appear economically\nviable,\u201d the FLUTE website states.\n\nBut in the microgravity of space, fluids behave in an intriguing way. Surface\ntension holds liquids together at their surfaces. We can see this on Earth,\nwhere some insects use surface tension to glide along the surfaces of ponds\nand other bodies of water. Also, on Earth, surface tension holds small drops\nof water together. But in space, away from Earth\u2019s dominating gravity, surface\ntension is much more effective. There, water maintains the most energy\nefficient shape there is: a sphere.\n\nAnother force governs water: adhesion. Adhesion causes liquids to cling to\nsurfaces. In the microgravity of space, adhesion can bind liquid to a\ncircular, ring-like frame. Then, due to surface tension, the liquid will\nnaturally adopt a spherical shape. If the liquid can be made to bulge inward\nrather than outward, and if the liquid is reflective enough, it creates a\ntelescope mirror.\n\nThe FLUTE team would like to make optical components in space. The liquid\nwould stay in the liquid state and form an extremely smooth light-collecting\nsurface. As a bonus, FLUTE would also self-repair after any micrometeorite\nstrike.\n\nThe FLUTE study is led by Edward Balaban from NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center in\nCalifornia\u2019s Silicon Valley. The FLUTE team has already done some tests on the\nISS and on zero-g flights.\n\nFLUTE researchers experience microgravity aboard Zero Gravity Corporation\u2019s\nG-FORCE ONE aircraft while operating an experiment payload during a series of\nparabolic flights.

It\u2019s a six-month journey each way, plus time\nspent on the surface. All that time in microgravity, exposure to radiation,\nand other challenges make the trip very difficult for astronauts. PPR aims to\nfix that.\n\nPPR isn\u2019t a launch vehicle for escaping Earth\u2019s gravity well. It would be\nlaunched on a heavy lift vehicle like SLS and then sent on its way.\n\nPPR was originally derived from the Pulsed Fission Fusion concept. But it\u2019s\nmore affordable, and also smaller and simpler. PPR might generate 100,000 N of\nthrust with a specific impulse (Isp) of 5,000 seconds. Those are good numbers.\nPPR could reduce the travel time to Mars to two months.\n\nIt has other benefits as well. It could propel larger spacecraft to Mars on\ntrips longer than two months, carrying more cargo and also provide heavier\nshielding against cosmic rays. \u201cThe PPR enables a whole new era in space\nexploration,\u201d the team writes.\n\nPPR is basically a fusion system ignited by fission. It\u2019s similar to a\nthermonuclear weapon. But rather than a run-away explosion, the combined\nenergy is directed through a magnetic nozzle to produce thrust.\n\nIn phase two, the PPR team intends to optimize the engine design to produce\nmore specific impulse, perform proof-of-concept experiments for major\ncomponents, and design a shielded ship for human missions to Mars.\n\nThis study is led by Brianna Clements with Howe Industries in Scottsdale,\nArizona.\n\nThe Great Observatory for Long Wavelengths (GO-LoW)\n\nOne of modern astronomy\u2019s last frontiers is the low-frequency radio sky.\nEarth\u2019s ionosphere blocks our ground-based telescopes from seeing it. And\nspace-based telescopes can\u2019t see it either. It\u2019s because the wavelengths are\nso long, in the meter to the kilometre scale. Only extremely massive\ntelescopes could see these waves clearly.\n\nGO-LoW is a potential solution. It\u2019s a space-based array of thousands of\nidentical Small-Sats arranged as an interferometer. It would sit at an Earth-\nSun Lagrange point and observe exoplanet and stellar magnetic fields.\nExoplanet magnetic fields emit radio waves between 100 kHz and 15 MHz. The GO-\nLoW team says their interferometer could perform the first survey of\nexoplanetary magnetic fields within 5 parsecs (16 light years.) Magnetic\nfields tell scientists a lot about an exoplanet, its evolution, and its\nprocesses.\n\nGO-LoW is a Great Observatory concept to open the last unexplored window of\nthe electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. The Earth\u2019s ionosphere becomes opaque at\napproximately 10m wavelengths, so GO-LoW will join Great Observatories like\nHST and JWST in space to access this spectral window. Image Credits: NASA/GO-\nLoW\n\nWhile there\u2019s no doubt that large telescopes like the JWST are powerful and\neffective, they\u2019re extremely complex and expensive. And if something goes\nwrong with a critical component, the mission could end.\n\nGO-LoW takes a different approach. By using thousands of individual\nsatellites, the system is more resilient. GO-LoW would have a hybrid\nconstellation. Some of the satellites would be smaller and simpler satellites\ncalled \u201clistener nodes\u201d (LN,) while a smaller number of them would be\n\u201ccommunication and computation\u201d nodes (CCNs). They would collect data from the\nLNs, process it, and beam it back to Earth.\n\nThe GO-LoW says it would only take a few heavy launches to place an entire\n100,000 satellite constellation in space.\n\nThe technology for the SmallSats already exists. The challenge the GO-LoW team\nwill address with their phase two funding is developing a system that will\nharness everything together effectively. \u201cThe coordination of all these\nphysical elements, data products, and communications systems is novel and\nchallenging, especially at scale,\u201d they write.\n\nGO-LoW is led by Mary Knapp with MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nRadioisotope Thermoradiative Cell Power Generator\n\nIt\u2019s sort of like solar power in reverse.\n\nThe RTCPG is a power source for spacecraft visiting the outer planets. They\npromise smaller, more efficient power generation for smaller science and\nexploration missions that can\u2019t carry a solar power system or nuclear power\nsystem. Both those systems are bulky, and solar power is limited the further\naway from the sun a spacecraft goes.\n\nThe thermoradiative cell (TRC) uses radioisotopes to create heat as an MMRTG\ndoes. But the TRC uses the heat to generate infrared light which generates\nelectricity. In initial testing, the system generated 4.5 times more power\nfrom the same amount of PU-238.\n\nMuch of phase two\u2019s work will involve materials. \u201cMetal-semiconductor contacts\ncapable of surviving the required elevated temperatures will be investigated,\u201d\nthe team explains. The team developed a special cryostat testing apparatus in\nphase one.\n\n\u201cBuilding on our results from Phase I, we believe there is much more potential\nto unlock here,\u201d the team writes.\n\nThis power generation concept study is from Stephen Polly at the Rochester\nInstitute of Technology in New York.\n\nFLOAT: Flexible Levitation on a Track\n\nWhat if Artemis is enormously successful? How will astronauts move their\nequipment around the lunar surface efficiently?\n\nIf the team behind FLOAT has their way, they\u2019ll build the Moon\u2019s first\nrailway. Sort of. This artist\u2019s concept shows a possible future mission\ndepicting the lunar surface with planet Earth on the horizon. Image Credit:\nEthan Schaler\n\nFLOAT would provide autonomous transportation for payloads on the Moon. \u201cA\ndurable, long-life robotic transport system will be critical to the daily\noperations of a sustainable lunar base in the 2030\u2019s,\u201d the FLOAT team writes.\n\nThe heart of FLOAT is a three-layer flexible track that\u2019s unrolled into\nposition without major construction. It consists of three layers: a graphite\nlayer, a flex-circuit layer, and a solar panel layer.\n\nThe graphite layer allows robots to use diamagnetic levitation to float over\nthe track. The flex-circuit layer supplies the thrust that moves them, and the\nthin-film solar panel layer generates electricity for a lunar base when it\u2019s\nin sunlight.\n\nThe system can be used to move regolith around for in-situ resource\nutilization and to transport payloads around a lunar base, for example, from\nlanding zones to habitats.\n\n\u201cIndividual FLOAT robots will be able to transport payloads of varying\nshape/size (>30 kg/m^2) at useful speeds (>0.5m/s), and a large-scale FLOAT\nsystem will be capable of moving up to 100,000s kg of regolith/payload\nmultiple kilometres per day,\u201d the FLOAT team explains.\n\nWith their phase two funding, the FLOAT team intends to design, build, and\ntest scaled-down versions of FLOAT robots and track. Then, they\u2019ll test their\nsystem in a lunar analog testbed. They\u2019ll also test environmental effects on\nthe system and how they alter the system\u2019s performance and longevity.\n\nEthan Schaler leads FLOAT at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern\nCalifornia.\n\nSCOPE: ScienceCraft for Outer Planet Exploration\n\nSome of the most intriguing planets and moons in the Solar System are well\nbeyond Jupiter. But exploring them is challenging. Extremely long travel\ntimes, restrictive mission windows, and large expenses limit our exploration.\nBut SCOPE aims to address these limitations.\n\nTypically, a spacecraft carries a propulsion and power system along with its\ninstruments and communication systems. NASA\u2019s Juno mission to Jupiter, for\nexample, carries a chemical rocket engine for propulsion, 50 square meters of\nsolar panels, and 10 science instruments. The solar panels alone weigh 340 kg\n(750 lbs.) Juno is powerful, produces a wide variety of quality science data,\nand is expensive.\n\nScienceCraft takes a different approach. It combines a single science\ninstrument and spacecraft into one monolithic structure. It\u2019s basically a\nsolar sail with a built-in spectrometer. They\u2019re aiming their design at the\nNeptune-Triton system.\n\nThis artist\u2019s depiction shows ScienceCraft, which integrates the science\ninstrument with the spacecraft by printing a quantum dot spectrometer directly\non the solar sail to form a monolithic, lightweight structure. Image Credit:\nMahmooda Sultana\n\n\u201cBy printing an ultra-lightweight quantum dot-based spectrometer, developed by\nthe PI Sultana, directly on the solar sail, we create a breakthrough\nspacecraft architecture allowing an unprecedented parallelism and throughput\nof data collection and rapid travel across the solar system,\u201d the ScienceCraft\nteam writes.\n\nInstead of merely providing the propulsion, the sail doubles as the\nspacecraft\u2019s science instrument. The small mass means that ScienceCraft could\nbe carried into orbit as a secondary payload. The team says they\u2019ll use phase\ntwo to identify and develop key technologies for the spacecraft and to further\nmature the mission concept. They say that because of the low cost and\nsimplicity, they could be ready by 2045.\n\n\u201cBy leveraging these benefits, we propose a mission concept to Triton, a\nunique planetary body in our solar system, within the short window that closes\naround 2045 to answer compelling science questions about Triton\u2019s atmosphere,\nionosphere, plumes and internal structure,\u201d the ScienceCraft team explains.\n\nScienceCraft is led by NASA\u2019s Mahmooda Sultana at the agency\u2019s Goddard Space\nFlight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nCategoriesSpace Exploration Technologies, Spacecraft, TelescopesTagsFlexible\nLevitation on a Track, Fluidic Telescope, Great Observatory for Long\nWavelengths, NASA, NIAC, Pulsed Plasma Rocket, ScienceCraft, Thermoradiative\nCell\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
