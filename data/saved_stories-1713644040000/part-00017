It zoomed in\ntight on him as he smeared the contents of the container on his gloves, the\ncommentators laughing and questioning why he would be using the product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore the camera panned away, I grabbed my phone, took a photo of Onana\nholding the tub of Vaseline, and sent a text to Robin Streifert, goalkeeper\nfor my club Angelholms FF in the Swedish third division, with the caption,\n\u201cLooks like Onana is in on the secret.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I had a talk with him about it last week!\u201d he joked.\n\nI vividly remember when Robin started using Vaseline on his gloves like it was\nyesterday. It was our first training session after our summer break last year\nwhen he brought a jar of Vaseline out with him to the training pitch. I\ninitially thought he might smear some on his elbows and knees to help soften\nthe fall when he dived, but when he opened the jar and started smearing it on\nthe goalpost, then his gloves, I couldn\u2019t help but laugh.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing? You want to catch the ball, don\u2019t you?\u201d I asked\nhim as I smiled.\n\nHe looked at me with a little grin and replied, \u201cYou laugh, but trust me, it\nworks! My grip has never been better.\u201d\n\nHe told me how Bordeaux\u2019s Swedish goalkeeper Karl-Johan Johnsson (or \u201cKalle\u201d\nfor short) introduced him to it during a training session they had together\nover the holiday.\n\nRobin said he was initially skeptical like I was and \u201cexpected the ball to\nslip out of my hands like a bar of soap\u201d. But after getting some of the\nVaseline transferred onto his gloves via the ball during their session, he\nnoticed the effect it had on his grip and knew he needed to try it out for\nhimself. After smearing some of it on his gloves, he was hooked.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe how much better my grip was,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI\u2019m sure part\nof it was mental, especially when you try something new, but it really felt\nlike there was a benefit.\u201d\n\nWhen the ball started smacking into his gloves just a little bit tighter than\nI remember it doing before our summer break, I became intrigued and knew at\nthe end of training I would have to try it for myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the session finished, I ran into the dressing room, grabbed a pair of\ngloves I had sitting in my locker and went back out to the pitch. I took a dab\nof Vaseline, smeared it on my gloves, and hopped in goal. As Robin and our\nsecond goalkeeper, Lukas Bornandersson, started to pepper me with shots, I\nimmediately noticed the difference and the impact the Vaseline had on my grip.\n\nMy gloves had some age to them and it had been a while since they had been\nused, but the Vaseline suddenly gave them new life. The only downside I could\nfind was that I needed to occasionally reapply a new coating on my gloves when\nthe effect wore off. That\u2019s where the Vaseline on the posts came in handy. If\nI needed to reapply quickly, I just had to go over to the post, swipe off a\nchunk, and wipe it on my gloves.\n\nOnana rises high to claim a cross (Andrew Kearns \u2013 CameraSport via Getty\nImages)\n\nBut I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around why it worked. Vaseline was a lubricant,\nwhy didn\u2019t it make the ball slip through my fingers?\n\nIn the months since, I\u2019ve done some research and learned the intricacies of\nwhy it\u2019s effective. My understanding is that latex is a porous material, so\nover time, when the palm of the glove breaks down, it allows dirt and water to\nflood the latex and you end up losing grip. What Vaseline does is moisturise\nthe latex of the gloves while also acting as a repellent to water and grime\nfrom covering the glove, allowing the latex to do the job it\u2019s designed to do:\ngrip the ball.\n\nAfter seeing Onana use it and having time to reflect on my own experiences\nwith it, I knew I needed to go further up the chain and talk to Kalle\ndirectly. I sent him a message on Instagram to ask if he had some time to talk\nabout Vaseline. He replied almost immediately.\n\nWhen we hopped on a call a few hours later, there was an excited tone in his\nvoice, almost like that of a small child who had been privy to a secret and\ncouldn\u2019t wait to tell someone about it. Before I could even get my first\nquestion in, he enthusiastically asked me, \u201cSo have you tried it?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI began to laugh.\n\nThough Kalle and I have casually known each other for over a decade through\nour playing careers, we\u2019ve only ever talked a few times \u2014 but this time when\nwe talked, it felt like two old friends catching up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so good, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked. His excitement and curiosity about what I\nthought was genuine.\n\n\u201cI know that it might not be for everyone, but for me, it\u2019s made a huge\ndifference,\u201d he explained.\n\nWhen I asked him how he first came across Vaseline, he couldn\u2019t remember\nexactly who introduced it to him, but one thing he knew for certain is that it\nwas at a Sweden national team camp in the 2015-16 season.\n\n\u201cI was totally against it in the beginning and a bit naive,\u201d he said. \u201cI had\nheard of it being used before but never really believed in it. I thought it\nwas just another one of those fads that would be out of the game as quickly as\nit appeared \u2014 but after a few training sessions and seeing the other\ngoalkeepers use it, I thought, \u2018OK, why not? I\u2019ll give it a go\u2019.\u201d\n\nHe went on to tell me there were a few different brands of petroleum jelly\nbeing used during that camp and though he could see the benefits directly, it\nwasn\u2019t until he tried Vaseline with \u201cthe blue top\u201d that he was completely sold\non the idea.\n\n\u201cInitially, I tried one brand for a few training sessions, but once I got\nintroduced to the other one (the one with the blue top), I switched\nimmediately,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI still can\u2019t remember if it was Robin (Olsen) or Kristoffer (Nordfeldt) who\nintroduced me to that brand, but it\u2019s by far my favourite. I remember buying\nfour or five tubs of that stuff and taking it back with me to my club at the\ntime. I still use the same one today.\u201d\n\nAt the professional level, the pitch is watered before every training session\nand match, often making the ball that goalkeepers are trying to catch\nincredibly slippery. When it\u2019s pouring rain on top of that, sometimes it can\nfeel almost like an impossible task to catch the ball, even with the best\nlatex gloves on the market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery goalkeeper is familiar with the feeling of your gloves being drenched\nand struggling to catch the ball cleanly as your hands feel like they weigh a\nhundred pounds. The job of the Vaseline is to prevent this from happening.\n\nThe biggest difference for Kalle since he started using Vaseline is its mental\nimpact on him, especially when trying to catch the ball in rainy conditions.\nKalle admits that he often had problems in the rain because the ball was hard\nto grip, but after he started using Vaseline on his gloves, he\u2019s seen a huge\nchange in his confidence when catching the ball.\n\nKalle shows off his Vaseline-covered gloves (Romain Perrocheau/AFP via Getty\nImages)\n\n\u201cThe mental part is so important to have a good feeling when you\u2019re playing,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cAnd having the ability to catch the ball is huge and gives me, as a\ngoalkeeper, so much more confidence.\n\n\u201cDuring matches, it\u2019s more natural to be safer and push or punch the ball\naway, but now I catch the ball way more than I used to. Vaseline really has\nmade a huge difference for me.\u201d\n\nI was curious if anything had changed in his routine since he started using\nVaseline and he said without hesitation, \u201cI\u2019ve learned how to use it\nproperly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI used to use a lot more of it than I do now, but now I know how much I need\nto use and when I need to use it,\u201d he said.\n\nHe admitted it took a while to get the exact combination correct and learnt\nfrom trial and error, but said that today, he has his routine down to almost a\nscience.\n\nOn matchdays, he first puts water on his gloves, then wipes them off with a\ntowel, before smearing a small amount of Vaseline on the palm of his gloves.\nHe then puts a small amount of Vaseline on the tape of his shin pads, in\naddition to a larger amount on the goalposts. However, he stresses the\nVaseline on the posts is just his backup in case he runs out during the match,\nwhich he said doesn\u2019t happen so often anymore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKalle said that one of the funnier things that has happened is that at almost\nevery club he\u2019s played for, he\u2019s become known to team-mates and fans as the\nguy who leaves Vaseline on all the posts around the country.\n\n\u201cI still receive messages from former team-mates in Denmark all the time\njoking that I left something behind when I moved to France,\u201d he said with a\nlaugh. \u201cIt\u2019s quite funny actually.\u201d\n\nIt was clear throughout our conversation how strongly he believed in using\nVaseline, but I had to know if he thought there were any negatives to using\nit.\n\n\u201cThat it doesn\u2019t work when the pitch is dry,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I always have a\nwater bottle with me so I can add water on the gloves if needed. Plus when we\nplay or train there is always water on the pitch.\u201d\n\nAs fascinating as all of this was, I was still curious if he knew who\nintroduced Robin and Kristoffer to Vaseline.\n\n\u201cI think Robin was introduced to it while at Copenhagen by Danish goalkeeper\nStephan Andersen and then he was the one who first brought it to the Swedish\nnational team. That\u2019s, at least, what Stephan told me when I moved to\nCopenhagen in 2019,\u201d he said as he laughed. \u201cStephan takes a lot of pride in\nthat it was a Dane who introduced Vaseline to the Swedes.\u201d\n\nKalle concluded our conversation by saying that he\u2019s introduced Vaseline to\nthe goalkeepers at every club he\u2019s been to \u2014 each time, the same thing\nhappens.\n\n\u201cThey are always so sceptical, much like Robin was when we trained together,\nbut after they see the results that I have in training and how many balls I\ncatch, they always eventually end up taking some Vaseline off the post and\nputting it on their gloves,\u201d he said. \u201cThey always end up loving it in the\nend.\u201d\n\n(Top photo: Andre Onana; by Robin Jones \u2013 AFC Bournemouth via Getty Images)\n\nNational\n\nBoxing\n\nBundesliga\n\nChampions League\n\nChampionship\n\nCollege Football\n\nCollege Sports\n\nCopa America\n\nCopa del Rey\n\nCulture\n\nEuropa League\n\nEuropean Championship\n\nFA Cup\n\nFantasy Baseball\n\nFantasy Basketball\n\nFantasy Football\n\nFantasy Hockey\n\nFantasy Premier League\n\nFormula 1\n\nGaming\n\nGolf\n\nInternational Football\n\nLa Liga\n\nLeague Cup\n\nLeague One\n\nLeague Two\n\nLNH\n\nMen's College Basketball\n\nMen's World Cup\n\nMixed Martial Arts\n\nMLB\n\nMLS\n\nMotorsports\n\nNASCAR\n\nNBA\n\nNFL\n\nNHL\n\nNWSL\n\nOlympics\n\nOpinion\n\nPremier League\n\nScottish Premiership\n\nSerie A\n\nSoccer\n\nSports Betting\n\nSports Business\n\nTennis\n\nUK Women's Football\n\nWNBA\n\nWomen's College Basketball\n\nWomen's Euros\n\nWomen's Hockey\n\nWomen's World Cup\n\nThe Athletic Ink\n\nPodcasts\n\nHeadlines\n\nUS\n\nArizona\n\nAtlanta\n\nBaltimore\n\nBay Area\n\nBoston\n\nBuffalo\n\nCarolina\n\nChicago\n\nCincinnati\n\nCleveland\n\nColumbus\n\nDallas\n\nDenver\n\nDetroit\n\nHouston\n\nIndiana\n\nJacksonville\n\nKansas City\n\nLas Vegas\n\nLos Angeles\n\nMemphis\n\nMiami\n\nMinnesota\n\nNashville\n\nNew Orleans\n\nNew York\n\nOklahoma\n\nOregon\n\nOrlando\n\nPhiladelphia\n\nPittsburgh\n\nSacramento\n\nSan Antonio\n\nSan Diego\n\nSeattle\n\nSt. Louis\n\nTampa Bay\n\nUtah\n\nWashington DC\n\nWisconsin\n\nCanada\n\nCalgary\n\nEdmonton\n\nMontreal\n\nMontr\u00e9al (fran\u00e7ais)\n\nOttawa\n\nToronto\n\nVancouver\n\nWinnipeg\n\nPartners\n\nTickets by Viagogo\n\nSubscribe\n\nStart Subscription\n\nGroup Subscriptions\n\nHQ\n\nAbout Us\n\nCareers\n\nCode of Conduct\n\nEditorial Guidelines\n\nBusiness Inquiries\n\nPress Inquiries\n\nSupport\n\nFAQ\n\nForgot Password?\n\nRedeem Gift\n\nContact Us\n\nTerms of Service\n\nNewsletters\n\nThe Pulse\n\nThe Bounce\n\nThe Windup\n\nPrime Tire\n\nFull Time\n\nUntil Saturday\n\nScoop City\n\nThe Athletic FC\n\n\u00a92024 The Athletic Media Company, A New York Times Company\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nManage Privacy Preferences\n\nSupport\n\nSitemap\n\n", "frontpage": false}
