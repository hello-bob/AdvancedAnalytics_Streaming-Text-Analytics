Scharf\n\nCaleb Scharf\n\nSomething very old, very powerful and very special has been unleashed on\nEarth.\n\nHumans are strange. For a global species, we\u2019re not particularly genetically\ndiverse, thanks in part to how our ancient roaming explorations caused\n\u201cfounder effects\u201d and \u201cbottleneck events\u201d that restricted our ancestral gene\npool. We also have a truly outsize impact on the planetary environment without\nmuch in the way of natural attrition to trim our influence (at least not yet).\n\nBut the strangest thing of all is how we generate, exploit, and propagate\ninformation that is not encoded in our heritable genetic material, yet travels\nwith us through time and space. Not only is much of that information\nrepresented in purely symbolic forms\u2014alphabets, languages, binary codes\u2014it is\nalso represented in each brick, alloy, machine, and structure we build from\nthe materials around us. Even the symbolic stuff is instantiated in some\nmaterial form or the other, whether as ink on pages or electrical charges in\nnanoscale pieces of silicon.\n\nAltogether, this \u201cdataome\u201d has become an integral part of our existence. In\nfact, it may have always been an integral, and essential, part of our\nexistence since our species of hominins became more and more distinct some\n200,000 years ago. This idea, which I also pursue in my upcoming book, The\nAscent of Information, leads to a number of quite startling and provocative\nproposals.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s consider our planetary impact. Today we can look at our\nspecies\u2019 energy use and see that of the roughly six to seven terawatts of\naverage global electricity production, about 3 percent to 4 percent is gobbled\nup by our digital electronics, in computing, storing and moving information.\nThat might not sound too bad\u2014except the growth trend of our digitized\ninformational world is such that it requires approximately 40 percent more\npower every year. Even allowing for improvements in computational efficiency\nand power generation, this points to a world in some 20 years where all of the\nenergy we currently generate in electricity will be consumed by digital\nelectronics alone.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just one facet of the energy demands of the human dataome. We still\nprint onto paper, and the energy cost of a single page is the equivalent of\nburning five grams of high-quality coal. Digital devices, from microprocessors\nto hard drives, are also extraordinarily demanding in terms of their\nproduction, owing to the deep repurposing of matter that is required. We\nliterally fight against the second law of thermodynamics to forge these\nexquisitely ordered, restricted, low-entropy structures out of raw materials\nthat are decidedly high-entropy in their messy natural states. It is hard to\nsee where this informational tsunami slows or ends.\n\nAll of which raises the question: Why exactly are we doing this?\n\nAn unexpected answer is that it\u2019s not just us doing this. Our dataome looks\nlike a distinct, although entirely symbiotic (even endosymbiotic), phenomenon.\nHomo sapiens arguably only exists as a truly unique species because of our\ncoevolution with a wealth of externalized information; starting from languages\nheld only in neuronal structures through many generations, to our tools and\nabstractions on pottery and cave walls, all the way to today\u2019s online world.\n\n## Related Stories\n\n  * ### After Months of Gibberish, Voyager 1 Is Communicating Well Again\n\nMeghan Bartels\n\n  * ### Low-Earth Orbit Faces a Spiraling Debris Threat\n\nAneli Bongers & Jos\u00e9 L.

Seeing ourselves this way opens the door to asking whether we\u2019re calling\nall the shots. After all, in a gene-centered view of biology, all living\nthings are simply temporary vehicles for the propagation and survival of\ninformation. In that sense the dataome is no different, and exactly how\ninformation survives is less important than the fact that it can do so. Once\nthat information and its algorithmic underpinnings are in place in the world,\nit will keep going forever if it can.\n\nA very simple example can be seen in any of the great works of human\nliterature, from Lao Tzu to Shakespeare. These writings, these informational\npackages, have found a way to persist through time by attaching themselves to\nus. We eagerly read them, restructuring our brains to remember them, and we go\nto great lengths to copy and reproduce these works, again and again across the\ncenturies and in many languages and forms. But these texts aren\u2019t just memes;\nthey\u2019re more like parts of a budded-off extended human phenotype that has its\nown processes and its own capacity to pressure the world around it to try to\nensure its survival.\n\nIn the course of life\u2019s three-to-four-billion-year history on Earth, it\ndoesn\u2019t seem that anything exactly like this has actually happened before. On\na geologic timescale, the emergence of the human dataome is like a sudden\nalien invasion, or an asteroid impact that precipitates a mass\nextinction\u2014changing how energy flows and how the biosphere functions. It\u2019s not\njust flesh-and-blood life on this world anymore. By a quirk of evolution, our\nvery existence as clever talkative apes has gone hand-in-hand with the\nunleashing of something else, a new trick for the restructuring of matter in\nservice of a phenomenon with very deep roots in the statistical arrangement of\natoms and molecules, in their order and disorder or dispersal: in entropy and\nits cousin, information.\n\nLook around where you are right now, at the walls of your room, or the chair\nyou\u2019re sitting on. Or the light you\u2019re reading by, and the screen or paper\nyou\u2019re reading these words from. In the end, all of these things are here in\nsupport of data, of ideas and of the most potent quantity in the universe:\ninformation. Our very alien dataome may just be the harbinger of things to\ncome.\n\nThis is an opinion and analysis article.\n\nRights & Permissions\n\nCaleb A. Scharf is a researcher and writer.
