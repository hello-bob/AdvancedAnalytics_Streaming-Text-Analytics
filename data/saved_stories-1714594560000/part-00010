(72.4 x 58.4\ncm) The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, The Friedsam Collection, Bequest\nof Michael Friedsam, 1931 (32.100.132)\nhttp://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/436236\n\nThe myth that American founding father Benjamin Franklin (Jan. 17, 1706 to\nApril 17, 1790) was antisemitic first emerged 87 years ago\u2014144 years after his\ndeath\u2014with the publication of a fraudulent and since then repeatedly\ndiscredited text commonly known as the \u201cFranklin Prophecy.\u201d\n\nGet the Atlanta Jewish Connector Weekly Magazines\n\nand never miss the best stories and events!\n\nsubscribe now\n\nOn Feb. 3, 1934, William Dudley Pelley, the occultist head of the pro-Nazi\nSilver Legion of America and publisher and editor of the fascist Liberation,\nran an article headlined \u201cDid Benjamin Franklin Say this about the Hebrews?\u201d\nIt contained a supposed excerpt from the previously unknown diary of Charles\nCoatesworth Pinckney, South Carolina\u2019s delegate to the Constitutional\nConvention.\n\nAs presented by Pelley, the \u201cPrivate Diary of Charles Pinckney\u201d or \u201cCharles\nPinckney\u2019s Diary\u201d recorded a lengthy diatribe against Jews during the\nConvention, with Franklin describing them as \u201ca great danger for the United\nStates of America\u201d and as \u201cvampires,\u201d and with his calling for the\nConstitution to bar and expel them from the country, lest in the future they\nadversely change its form of government.\n\nBy August 1934, Pelley\u2019s \u201cFranklin Prophecy\u201d was already being republished in\nNazi Germany. Nazi leaders and sympathizers helped disseminate the fraud in\nGerman, French and English, and in Germany, Switzerland and the United States.\n\nIn September 1934, the \u201cFranklin Prophecy\u201d reached American historian Charles\nA. Beard, best known for his 1913 work An Economic Interpretation of the\nConstitution of the United States. Beard began searching for an original\nsource for the \u201cFranklin Prophecy,\u201d in the process consulting with other\nscholars such as John Franklin Jameson, who was chief of the Library of\nCongress Manuscript Division.\n\nSix months later, in March 1935, Beard\u2019s conclusions were published in The\nJewish Frontier, which then reprinted his essay as a pamphlet titled Charles\nBeard Exposes Anti-Semitic Forgery about Benjamin Franklin. Summing up the\nresults of his investigations, Beard wrote:\n\nAll these searches have produced negative results. I cannot find a single\noriginal source that gives the slightest justification for believing that the\n\u201cProphecy\u201d is anything more than a bare-faced forgery. Not a word have I\ndiscovered in Franklin\u2019s letters and papers expressing any such sentiments\nagainst the Jews as ascribed to him by the Nazis\u2014American and German. His\nwell-known liberality in matters of religious opinions would, in fact, have\nprecluded the kind of utterances put in his mouth by this palpable forgery.\n\nHenry Butler Allen, director of the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, also\nweighed in on the fanciful Pinckney diary, stating: \u201cHistorians and librarians\nhave not been able to find it or any record of it having existed.\u201d\n\nBeard, Allen, and several other scholars\u2019 responses were collected into the\npamphlet Benjamin Franklin Vindicated: An Exposure of the Franklin \u2018Prophecy\u2019\nby American Scholars, issued jointly in 1938 by the International Benjamin\nFranklin Society, the American Jewish Committee, the American Jewish Congress,\nand the Jewish Labor Committee.\n\nA more recent discussion of the emergence and debunking of the \u201cFranklin\nProphecy\u201d is found in Nian-Sheng Huang\u2019s Benjamin Franklin in American Thought\nand Culture, 1790-1990, published in 1994 by the American Philosophical\nSociety. Huang shows the \u201cFranklin Prophecy\u201d to be an extreme case of\nexploiting, vulgarizing, and distorting Franklin\u2019s legacy. The ease with which\nit has spread, and its staying power among antisemites and anti-Zionists,\ndemonstrate how successful bigots worldwide have been in misappropriating the\nAmerican founding father\u2019s good name and fame for their abhorrent purposes.\n\nThroughout his life, Franklin saw a positive societal role for faith and\npublic worship, and generally advocated religious tolerance and inclusivity.\nIn his posthumously-published autobiography, he professed a lifelong interest\nin projects \u201cserviceable to People in all Religions.\u201d\n\nDespite his famous liberality in matters of religious opinions, on a few\noccasions he did use offensive language about Jews in his private\ncorrespondence, though this language does not come close to the antisemitic\nvitriol he ostensibly publicly uttered in the \u201cProphecy.\u201d Franklin, who also\nowned slaves and featured slaves for sale in his newspaper prior to becoming\nan abolitionist, was not at all times free of prejudice.\n\nIn much of today\u2019s popular culture, there often seems to be room only for\nsaints or villains. Franklin was neither. He was a complex person whose ideas\nand actions evolved as he matured, as he confronted new situations, and as he\ngrew older. Later in life, Franklin became an anti-slavery activist, and he\naccepted the ceremonial presidency of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society in\n1787.\n\nIn 1788, after synagogue construction and difficult economic conditions\nplunged Philadelphia\u2019s Congregation Mikveh Israel into debt, its members\nturned to their neighbors, \u201cworthy fellow Citizens of every religious\nDenomination,\u201d for assistance. Franklin, who had never been hostile to Jews,\nled by example in the city and donated five pounds to help ensure the\ncontinued presence of Philadelphia\u2019s oldest formal Jewish congregation.\n\nAs was fitting for a man who tried hard to be \u201cserviceable to People in all\nReligions,\u201d when Franklin died two years later the press was able to report\nthat his funeral procession in Philadelphia was led by \u201call the Clergy of the\ncity, including the Ministers of the Hebrew congregation.\u201d\n\nRemarkably, Franklin eventually influenced Jewish thought and practice. This\noccurred primarily through his autobiography, which reached the prominent\nmaskil (proponent of the Jewish Enlightenment) Rabbi Menahem Mendel Lefin in\nEurope. In 1808, Lefin published Sefer Heshbon Ha-nefesh (Book of Spiritual\nAccounting), which introduced Franklin\u2019s method for character improvement to\nHebrew-reading Jewish audiences. This text, with its Franklin-based method,\nbecame accepted and valued among mussar (applied Jewish ethics, or practical\nJewish ethical instruction) practitioners, made its way into yeshivot and is\nstill studied today.\n\nThe \u201cFranklin Prophecy,\u201d however, shows no signs of going away. It is too\nuseful for those who want to hate.\n\nAn earlier version of this article appeared in JewThink on March 8, 2021.
