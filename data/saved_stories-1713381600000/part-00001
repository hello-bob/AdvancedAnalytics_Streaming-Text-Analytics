So were baby-boomers\n\nIllustration: Vincent Kilbride\n\nApr 16th 2024|Kalamata and New York\n\nGeneration Z is taking over. In the rich world there are at least 250m people\nborn between 1997 and 2012. About half are now in a job. In the average\nAmerican workplace, the number of Gen Zers (sometimes also known as \u201cZoomers\u201d)\nworking full-time is about to surpass the number of full-time baby-boomers,\nthose born from 1945 to 1964, whose careers are winding down (see chart 1).\nGen Z is also grabbing power: America now has more than 6,000 Zoomer chief\nexecutives and 1,000 Zoomer politicians. As the generation becomes more\ninfluential, companies, governments and investors need to understand it.\n\nPundits produce a lot of fluff about the cohort. Recent \u201cresearch\u201d from Frito-\nLay, a crisp-maker, finds that Gen Zers have a strong preference for \u201csnacks\nthat leave remnants on their fingers\u201d, such as cheese dust. Yet different\ngenerations also display deeper differences in their personalities, in part\ndue to the economic context in which they grow up. Germans who reached\nadulthood during the high-inflation 1920s came to detest rising prices.\nAmericans who lived through the Depression tended to avoid investing in the\nstockmarket.\n\n#### Already have an account?Log in\n\n## Get unlimited access to The Economist\n\n### Explore all our independent journalism with a one-month free trial.
