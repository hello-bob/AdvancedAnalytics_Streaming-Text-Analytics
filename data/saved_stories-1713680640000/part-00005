Last time this happened, Earth got plants.\n\nThe phenomenon is called primary endosymbiosis, and it occurs when one\nmicrobial organism engulfs another, and starts using it like an internal\norgan. In exchange, the host cell provides nutrients, energy, protection and\nother benefits to the symbiote, until eventually it can no longer survive on\nits own and essentially ends up becoming an organ for the host \u2013 or what\u2019s\nknown as an organelle in microbial cells.\n\nMore Stories\n\nScience\n\nOctopus-inspired grasper gets it right by mimicking mucus\n\nEnvironment\n\n45% of China's urban land is rapidly sinking due to manmade development\n\n### We recommend\n\nPowered by\n\n  * Targeting settings\n  * Do not sell my personal information\n  * Google Analytics settings\n\nImagine if kidneys were actually little animals running around, and humans had\nto manually filter their blood through a dialysis machine. Then one day some\nguy somehow gets one of these kidney critters stuck... Internally (who are we\nto judge how?) \u2013 and realizes he no longer needs his dialysis machine. Neither\ndo his kids, until eventually we're all born with these helpful little fellas\ninside us. That\u2019s kind of what\u2019s happening here.\n\nA diagram of the mitochondria in a cell\n\nNational Human Genome Research Institute\n\nIn the 4-billion-odd-year history of life on Earth, primary endosymbiosis is\nthought to have only happened twice that we know of, and each time was a\nmassive breakthrough for evolution. The first occurred about 2.2 billion years\nago, when an archaea swallowed a bacterium that became the mitochondria. This\nspecialized energy-producing organelle allowed for basically all complex forms\nof life to evolve. It remains the heralded \"powerhouse of the cell\" to this\nday.\n\nThe second time happened about 1.6 billion years ago, when some of these more\nadvanced cells absorbed cyanobacteria that could harvest energy from sunlight.\nThese became organelles called chloroplasts, which gave sunlight-harvesting\nabilities, as well as a fetching green color, to a group of lifeforms you\nmight have heard of \u2013 plants.\n\nLive moss cells under a microscope, showing their chloroplasts (green circles)\n\nDes_Callaghan/CC BY-SA 4.0\n\nAnd now, scientists have discovered that it\u2019s happening again. A species of\nalgae called Braarudosphaera bigelowii was found to have engulfed a\ncyanobacterium that lets them do something that algae, and plants in general,\ncan\u2019t normally do \u2013 \"fixing\" nitrogen straight from the air, and combining it\nwith other elements to create more useful compounds.\n\nNitrogen is a key nutrient, and normally plants and algae get theirs through\nsymbiotic relationships with bacteria that remain separate. At first it was\nthought that B. bigelowii had hooked up this kind of situation with a\nbacterium called UCYN-A, but on closer inspection, scientists discovered that\nthe two have gotten far more intimate.\n\nIn one recent study, a team found that the size ratio between the algae and\nUCYN-A stays similar across different related species of the algae. Their\ngrowth appears to be controlled by the exchange of nutrients, leading to\nlinked metabolisms.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what happens with organelles,\u201d said Jonathan Zehr, an author\nof the studies. \u201cIf you look at the mitochondria and the chloroplast, it\u2019s the\nsame thing: they scale with the cell.\u201d\n\nIn a follow-up study, the team and other collaborators used a powerful X-ray\nimaging technique to view the interior of the living algae cells. This\nrevealed that the replication and cell division was synchronized between the\nhost and symbiote \u2013 more evidence of primary endosymbiosis at work.\n\nX-ray images of Braarudosphaera bigelowii at different stages of cell\ndivision. The newly identified nitroplast is highlighted in cyan, the algae\nnucleus is blue, mitochondria are green and chloroplasts are purple\n\nValentina Loconte/Berkeley Lab\n\nAnd finally, the team compared the proteins of isolated UCYN-A to those inside\nthe algal cells. They found that the isolated bacterium can only produce about\nhalf of the proteins it needs, relying on the algal host to provide the rest.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the hallmarks of something moving from an endosymbiont to an\norganelle,\u201d said Zehr. \u201cThey start throwing away pieces of DNA, and their\ngenomes get smaller and smaller, and they start depending on the mother cell\nfor those gene products \u2013 or the protein itself \u2013 to be transported into the\ncell.\u201d\n\nAltogether, the team says this indicates UCYN-A is a full organelle, which is\ngiven the name of nitroplast. It appears that this began to evolve around 100\nmillion years ago, which sounds like an incredibly long time but is a blink of\nan eye compared to mitochondria and chloroplasts.\n\nThe researchers plan to continue studying nitroplasts, to find out if they\u2019re\npresent in other cells and what effects they may have. One possible benefit is\nthat it could give scientists a new avenue to incorporate nitrogen-fixing into\nplants to grow better crops.\n\nThe research was published in the journals Cell and Science.\n\nSource: Berkeley Lab\n\nView gallery - 4 images\n\n### We recommend\n\n  1.

Could this evolve (in xxx million years) into living \"animals\" (we may\nneed to find another term, such as \"nitromals\") that could \"eat\" (ingest and\nprocess nutrients) simply by breathing the air? (The air is made of 21%\noxygen, 78% NITROGEN (that \"we\" (animals) can't use) + other gasses such as\nargon, carbon dioxide + whatever you fart after a good dinner).\n\nveryken April 18, 2024 08:58 AM\n\nMore tricks from Nature that Man will copy soon into instant eugenics... ah,\nerr, ahem... I mean Corrective Medical Genome Editing.\n\nTechGazer April 18, 2024 09:02 AM\n\nQuite exciting really. While it's unlikely to have a major effect on the\necosystem via natural evolution, this ability might be easier to splice into\nexisting life forms than to develop from scratch. Imagine swapping this\norganelle into maize or rice or wheat? <insert conspiracy story involving\nfertilizer corporations kidnapping or assassinating researchers to maintain\ntheir profitable monopoly>\n\nEwlg April 18, 2024 03:19 PM\n\nTo explain the complexity of current animals, This event would have had to of\noccurred how many millions of times in the past. Assuming the neo darwinian\nsynthesis continues to meet the mathematical definition of \"absurd\"... Kidneys\njust walking around on their own in nature indeed.\n\nPaul L April 18, 2024 04:36 PM\n\nWhile new to us, the recent discovery of the algae Braarudosphaera bigelowii\nabsorbing a cyanobacteria is not entirely a new and likely started a long time\nago. It's just in the \"news\" because we're just observing this now for our\nfirst time.\n\nTanker_Man April 18, 2024 05:22 PM\n\nSounds like the movie Venom.\n\nTim Higgins April 19, 2024 01:43 AM\n\nIsn't this called symbiosis as the two organisms will still have their own\nseparate DNA.\n\nSteve Jones April 19, 2024 01:44 AM\n\nI'm told that it's also plausible that the first cell to gain a nucleus did so\nvia endosymbiosis. That would mean that it's happened at least four times on\nEarth and that has significant implications for the possibility of complex\nlifeforms existing on other planets, because complex life seems extremely rare\n(possibly unique to Earth) because a living cell is relatively likely to\noccur, but a complex cell which can evolve into multi-cellular life is almost\nimpossible... based on the observation that it only happened maybe once, as\nhad appeared to be the case.\n\nBozoTheBrown April 19, 2024 04:37 AM\n\nThey are still two completely different organisms. This is no different than\nsaying I am evolving if I get a tape worm.\n\nspectrum April 19, 2024 07:40 AM\n\nBozoTheBrown, nothing like you ingesting a tape worm. \"The phenomenon is\ncalled primary endosymbiosis, and it occurs when one microbial organism\nengulfs another, and starts using it like an internal organ.\"\n\nLoad More\n\n## GET OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nOver 220,000 people receive our email newsletter.
