The latest version 1.1 of the SCI\nSpecification is now available and can be accessed here.\n\n\"Reaching this milestone represents a collective effort from GSF member\norganizations,\" said Sanjay Podder, Responsible AI CTO and Lead for Tech\nSustainability Innovation at Accenture, and Chairperson of the GSF. \"This\nachievement unlocks the potential to achieve industry-wide adoption of the SCI\nSpecification, which is crucial in empowering organizations to achieve real-\nworld emissions reductions.\"\n\nApplying the SCI Specification enables users and developers to make informed\nchoices regarding tools, architectures, and services by incorporating carbon\nusage considerations, ultimately driving the adoption of more environmentally\nsustainable practices within the technology sector.\n\nUnlike some frameworks, the SCI Specification does not incorporate\nneutralizations or offsets into its calculations. Instead, it emphasizes\ngenuine efforts to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nBy adopting the SCI Specification, ICT and Technology companies gain access to\na standardized protocol to assess their software for emissions reduction\nopportunities. This landmark development enables organizations to demonstrate\ntheir commitment to quality, efficiency, and reliability in green software\ndevelopment.\n\n\"We believe that the opensource SCI Specification will catalyze a new era of\nsustainable innovation within the technology industry,\" added Henry\nRichardson, Senior Analyst at WattTime and Co-chair of the Standards Working\nGroup at the GSF. \"And, hopefully, is another indicator for how important\ncollective contributions from the opensource community are to scale green\nsoftware.\"\n\nTechnology sustainability is a shared responsibility, and having the right set\nof tools is crucial for realizing SCI specifications at scale. \"We are also\nmaking it easy to calculate SCI scores using tools such as the Impact\nFramework,\" added Navveen Balani, Co-chair of the Standards Working Group and\nImpact Framework at the GSF. \"We envision that SCI measurement will become a\nstandard part of every developer\u2019s toolbox and the norm in the future.\"\n\nGSF member organizations, including Accenture, AVEVA, CAST Software, Intesa,\nMicrosoft, NTT DATA, UBS, and others, made the SCI Specification actionable\nthrough various use cases. These examples are publicly available.\n\nThe GSF invites teams applying the SCI Specification to submit a use case for\nreview.\n\nIf you need more information on the Green Software Foundation or wish to\ncontact a spokesperson for an interview, contact Namrata Narayan at\nnamrata@greensoftware.foundation.\n\nThis article is licenced under Creative Commons (CC BY 4.0)\n\n## Stay updated with our articles updates\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Joint Development Foundation Projects, LLC, Green Software\nFoundation Series\n\n## Legal\n\n  * Trademark Policy\n  * Terms and Privacy Policy\n\n## More\n\n  * Membership enquires\n  * Join us\n  * Helpdesk\n\n## JOIN OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe Joint Development Foundation Projects, LLC is an affiliate of the Linux\nFoundation.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
