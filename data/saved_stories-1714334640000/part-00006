While serving as\ngovernor of Georgia, Carter was asked (on September 14, 1973) by the\nInternational UFO Bureau in Oklahoma City to file a report of the sighting,\nand he filed a statement on September 18, mailed September 20.^[1] Since its\nwriting, the report has been discussed several times by both ufologists and by\nmembers of the mainstream media.^[2]^[3]\n\n## Sighting[edit]\n\nOne evening in 1969, two years before he became Governor of Georgia, Carter\nwas preparing to give a speech at a Lions Club meeting. He reported that at\nabout 7:15 pm, one of the guests called his attention to a strange bright\nwhite object, about as bright as the moon, that was about 30 degrees above the\nhorizon to the west of where they were standing. It moved toward their\ndirection, but stopped beyond a stand of pine trees some distance from them.\nThe object then changed color, first to blue, then to red, then back to white,\nbefore appearing to recede into the distance.\n\nCarter felt that the object was self-illuminated, and not solid in nature.\nCarter's report indicates that it was witnessed by about 10 or 12 other\npeople, and was in view for 10 to 12 minutes before it passed out of\nsight.^[1]^[3]\n\nIn 1973, Carter reiterated:\n\n> There were about twenty of us standing outside of a little restaurant, I\n> believe, a high school lunch room, and a kind of green light appeared in the\n> western sky. This was right after sundown. It got brighter and brighter. And\n> then it eventually disappeared. It didn't have any solid substance to it, it\n> was just a very peculiar-looking light. None of us could understand what it\n> was.^[4]\n\nSpeaking in a 2005 interview, Carter said:\n\n> All of a sudden, one of the men looked up and said, 'Look, over in the\n> west!' And there was a bright light in the sky. We all saw it. And then the\n> light, it got closer and closer to us. And then it stopped, I don't know how\n> far away, but it stopped beyond the pine trees. And all of a sudden it\n> changed color to blue, and then it changed to red, then back to white. And\n> we were trying to figure out what in the world it could be, and then it\n> receded into the distance.^[3]\n\n### Date[edit]\n\nThe exact date on which the sighting occurred has been called into question by\ninvestigators. According to the report that he filed with the International\nUFO Bureau four years after the incident, Carter saw the UFO in October 1969.\nHowever, investigators have cited Lions Club records as evidence that it\noccurred nine months earlier.^[5]\n\nAccording to a meeting report that he filed with the Lions Club, Carter gave\nhis Leary speech on January 6, 1969, not in October. The setting of his\nJanuary meeting as described in his report to the Lions Club also matches the\nsetting that he would later describe to the media when speaking about his\nsighting. His report to the Lions Club made no mention of the sighting\nitself.^[5]\n\nOther evidence rules out the October 1969 date and is consistent with January\n1969. First, Carter visited the Leary Lions Club in his capacity as district\ngovernor of the Lions Club. His term ended in June 1969. Second, the Leary\nLions Club disbanded several months before October 1969.^[5]\n\n## Object and investigation[edit]\n\nAccording to an investigation^[by whom?] carried out in 1976, some seven years\nafter the event, most of those present at the meeting either did not recall\nthe event, or did not recall it as being anything important. According to Fred\nHart, the only guest contacted who remembered seeing the object: \"It seems\nlike there was a little\u2014like a blue light or something or other in the sky\nthat night\u2014like some kind of weather balloon they send out or something ... it\nhad been pretty far back in my mind.\"^[6]\n\nWhile puzzled by the object and its origins, Carter himself later said that,\nwhile he had considered the object to be a UFO\u2014on the grounds it was\nunexplained\u2014his knowledge of physics had meant he had not believed himself to\nbe witnessing an alien spacecraft.^[3]\n\nOn January 6, 1969, the sky was clear in Leary and the planet Venus was near\nits maximum brightness and in the direction described by Carter. Ufologist\nRobert Sheaffer concluded that the object that Carter witnessed was a\nmisidentification of Venus^[7]^[self-published source]^[8] Ufologist Allan\nHendry did calculations and agrees with the assessment of it being Venus.^[9]\nThis could also be the Venus \"Halo\",^[10] as was discussed on The Skeptics'\nGuide to the Universe podcast #105^[11] in a 2007 interview with Jimmy Carter.\nIn the interview Carter stated that he did not believe the object was Venus,\nexplaining that he was an amateur astronomer and knew what Venus looked like.\nHe also said that as a scientist he did not believe it was an alien craft and\nat the time assumed it was probably a military aircraft from a nearby base.\nHowever, he said that the object did not make any sound like a helicopter\nwould do. Carter also said that he did not believe that any extraterrestrials\nhave visited Earth. In the podcast interview, he also stated he knows of no\ngovernment cover-up of extraterrestrial visits and that the rumors that the\nCIA refused to give him information about UFOs are not true.\n\nIn 2016, the hosts of episode #561 of The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe\npodcast read a letter forwarded by a member of the Carter family from Carl G.\n\"Jere\" Justus, giving his explanation of Carter's UFO sighting:^[12]\n\n> After recently reading the book Georgia Myths & Legends, by Augusta\n> Chronicle columnist Don Rhodes, specifically Chapter 5, \"Jimmy Carter and\n> the UFO\", I am virtually certain that I have identified the source of what\n> it was that President Carter saw. In the 1960s and early 70s, I worked on an\n> Air Force sponsored project that studied the upper atmosphere using releases\n> of glowing chemical clouds, produced by rockets launched from Eglin AFB\n> rocket range in Florida. Some of these chemical clouds, notably sodium and\n> barium, were visible by the process of resonance scattering of sunlight.\n> Clouds of this type had to be launched not long after sunset or not long\n> before sunrise. This was due to the fact that the cloud had to be in\n> sunlight at high altitude, while it was still dark enough at ground level\n> for the cloud to be visible against the dark sky. In Carter's official 1973\n> UFO report, as given in the Rhodes book, he stated that he had seen the\n> phenomenon in October, 1969, at 7:15 pm EST. However, it has been determined\n> from Lions Club records that Carter must have seen the \"UFO\" when he spoke\n> to their Leary, GA Chapter on January 6, 1969. The report \"U.S. Space\n> Science Program Report to COSPAR, 1970\" (QB504.U54, Appendix I, page 154)\n> documents that there was a barium cloud launched from Eglin AFB (Rocket\n> Number AG7.626) and released on January 6, 1969 at 7:35 pm EST (January 7,\n> 1969, 0035 UTC) [COSPAR stands for Committee on Space Research]. The\n> reported altitude for this cloud was 152 km. With a distance between Leary,\n> GA and Eglin AFB, FL of about 234 km, this cloud would have appeared in the\n> sky at an elevation of 33 degrees (consistent with Carter's estimate of a 30\n> degree elevation). Carter's report notes that stars were visible, so the\n> night must have been clear. I can verify from personal experience that under\n> clear skies, a barium cloud such as this would easily have been visible from\n> the distance of Leary, GA. Carter reported the UFO \"appeared from West\". The\n> direction of Eglin AFB from Leary, GA is approximately WSW. Thus this barium\n> cloud at Eglin is consistent with Carter's reported \"UFO\" as to time,\n> elevation, and direction. Furthermore, the appearance reported by Carter is\n> totally consistent with a high-altitude barium cloud. His report stated that\n> it was \"bluish at first, then reddish, luminous, not solid\". A neutral\n> barium cloud would initially glow bluish or greenish, with parts of it\n> taking on a reddish glow as some of the barium becomes ionized in the high\n> altitude sunlight. The size and brightness, reported as being about that of\n> the moon, would also be consistent with a barium cloud at Eglin, as viewed\n> from Leary, GA. Carter has been reported as saying that he never believed\n> that he had seen an alien spacecraft, but that he had no idea exactly what\n> it was. I'm interested in exploring if this information could be relayed to\n> President Carter, so that if he wishes to, he can better understand what it\n> was that he saw back then.^[12]\n\nIn 2020, Justus completed an extensive study of the high-altitude barium\nrelease clouds, concluding that what Carter saw was \"totally consistent\" with\nwhat was launched that evening from Eglin AFB.^[13] Justus described several\nphysical aspects supporting consistency, and submitted a copy of the report\nfor archival at the Jimmy Carter Library.\n\n## Personal impact[edit]\n\nThe sighting is said to have had a personal impact on Carter and his\nperception of UFOs and UFO sightings. During his 1976 election campaign, he is\nsaid to have told reporters that, as a result of it, he would institute a\npolicy of openness if he were elected to office, saying:\n\n> One thing's for sure, I'll never make fun of people who say they've seen\n> unidentified objects in the sky. If I become President, I'll make every\n> piece of information this country has about UFO sightings available to the\n> public and the scientists.^[14]\n\nDespite his earlier pledge, once elected, Carter distanced himself from\ndisclosure, citing \"defense implications\" as being behind his decision.^[15]\n\n## 1970s media reports[edit]\n\n  * \"Carter Once Saw a UFO on 'Very Sober Occasion'\", by Howell Raines, Atlanta Constitution, Sept. 14, 1973, p. 1D\n  * Carter's story appeared in the June 8, 1976 issue of The National Enquirer. This account contained a number of errors, including incorrectly stating that the event occurred in Thomaston, Georgia in 1973, and that sighting was after the club meeting.^[16]\n  * Hayden Hughs of International UFO Bureau wrote an article that appeared in the November 1976 issue of Argosy UFO (a spin-off of Argosy).\n  * In February 1977, NICAP republished Carter's original report in UFO Investigator, but altered his handwritten report to make it appear that it had been submitted directly to NICAP as a typed document.^[17]^[18]\n  * The April 30, 1977 edition of The Washington Post ran the story on the front page, incorrectly giving the date as 1973. The identification of the UFO as Venus ran in a small item in the May 9, 1977 issue.^[19]\n  * \"President Carter's 'UFO' Is Identified as the Planet Venus\", by Robert Sheaffer, Humanist magazine, July\u2013August, 1977, p. 46\n  * \"Learyites leery of Carter's encounter: No one recalls 1970 UFO spotting\", by Tom Tiede, Mt.
