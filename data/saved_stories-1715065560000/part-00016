It is built using Gerby, created by Pieter Belmans and\nRaymond Cheng, which is a fork of plasTeX. The Clowder Project follows the\nmassively collaborative model started by the Stacks Project or the Automorphic\nProject.\n\nAs a completely static website hosted on GitHub pages, there is currently no\nsystem for on-site comments like those in the Stacks Project, Kerodon, or the\nAutomorphic Project.\n\nHowever, there's a dedicated Discord server, which you can join here. There\nyou'll find channels for discussion and comments, hopefully partly making up\nfor the lack of an in-site comment system.\n\nBesides comments and discussions, the Clowder Project Discord server also has\na dedicated channel for updates, collecting both major news regarding the\nproject as well as periodic updates on additions to it that are currently\nbeing worked on.\n\nIn general, any and all comments, no matter how small (even things like very\nsmall typos), are extremely welcome, as are contributions.\n\nHere are some further notes on the project:\n\nPlaceholder Symbols and Future Style. Currently, a number of macros have been\ndefined using placeholder symbols, and look very ugly as a result.\n\nThis is because I eventually plan to replace them with (the math font for)\nDarwin, a free and open-source typeface project I'm currently working on,\nwhich will eventually allow me more freedom in writing these notes:\n\nYou can find more details about Darwin at its GitHub repository or website.\n\nFootnotes. There are lots of footnotes, due to how the original PDFs were\ncreated. They automatically expand when you hover your mouse over them; here's\nan example^[1].\n\nLarge Diagrams and the Zoom In Feature. This work features many diagrams that\nare unfortunately too large to be comfortably legible in their native size. To\ncompensate for this, it is possible to click on them to expand their size by\n200%, or alternatively open them as separate images in new tabs by right-\nclicking and then selecting \u201cOpen image in new tab\u201d.\n\nA Note on Style. There are a few uncommon stylistic choices made and mantained\nthroughout these notes:\n\n  * Every proposition, theorem, lemma, etc. needs to come with a proof, even if the latter simply reads \u201cOmitted.\u201d. This is to ensure results without proof are clearly labeled as such.\n  * There's a considerably larger amount of repetition than is usual in a math text, as well as non-linearity. This is done with the intention of making the Clowder Project work also as a wiki, making individual sections and subsections more self-contained.\n\nPreferences. You can change the font of the site, the style of the PDFs, as\nwell as turn on dark mode by clicking the gear button at the top of the page.\n\nPDF Styles. The PDFs for each chapter as well as for the whole book are\ngenerated using four different styles, as summarised in the following table:\n\nStyle| Class| Font| Theorem Environments  \n---|---|---|---  \nStyle 1| book| Alegreya Sans| tcbthm  \nStyle 2| book| Alegreya Sans| amsthm  \nStyle 3| book| Arno*| amsthm  \nStyle 4| book| Computer Modern| amsthm  \n  \n*To be replaced with Linus Romer's Elemaints when it is released.\n\nSupport. If you like the work I'm doing and would like to support it\nfinancially, you can do so at Ko-Fi:\n\nSupport Me on Ko-fi\n\nI've been struggling financially for the past couple months, and my current\nsource of income is unfortunately very unstable and fragile, so any donations\nwould go a long way in helping ensure I'm able to continue working on this\nproject.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n[1] Most of the footnotes are quite unimportant and can be ignored, though.\n\n  * References\n  * Contents\n  * GitHub\n  * Changes\n  * Discord\n\n### Recent commits\n\n  * 16 Sep 2023: Initial commit\n\n### Statistics\n\nThe Clowder Project now consists of\n\n  * 478 pages\n  * 16373 lines of code\n  * 1600 tags\n  * 42 sections\n  * 10 chapters\n\nDownload the book as a PDF\n\n", "frontpage": true}
