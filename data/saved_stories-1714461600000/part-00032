It\u2019s a common belief that you can get out of recurring charges\nlike this by canceling your credit card. Netflix won\u2019t be able to find you,\nand your account will just go away, right? You wouldn\u2019t be crazy for believing\nit, but it\u2019s a myth that canceling a credit card will definitely stop your\nrecurring charges.\n\n#### Related Content\n\nAmazon Simmers Down, Says It Won\u2019t Block Visa Credit Cards in UK Store on Jan.\n19 After All\n\nAmazon to Stop Taking Visa Credit Cards in the UK Thanks to Brexit\n\nNetflix Passwords, ChatGPT Can\u2019t Detect AI, and No More CoTweets | Editor Picks\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nview video\n\nNetflix Passwords, ChatGPT Can\u2019t Detect AI, and No More CoTweets | Editor Picks\n\nNearly 46% of Americans opened a new credit card last year, according to\nForbes, which means millions of Americans also canceled old ones. When you\nswitch cards, Netflix doesn\u2019t just stop your service \u2014 they just start\ncharging your new card. Granted, it might be easier to just cancel your\nNetflix subscription directly. There\u2019s a largely hidden service that enables\nNetflix and most other subscription services to keep throwing charges at you\nindefinitely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nAmazon Simmers Down, Says It Won\u2019t Block Visa Credit Cards in UK Store on Jan.\n19 After All\n\nAmazon to Stop Taking Visa Credit Cards in the UK Thanks to Brexit\n\nNetflix Passwords, ChatGPT Can\u2019t Detect AI, and No More CoTweets | Editor Picks\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nNetflix Passwords, ChatGPT Can\u2019t Detect AI, and No More CoTweets | Editor Picks\n\n\u201cBanks may automatically update credit or debit card numbers when a new card\nis issued. This update allows your card to continue to be charged, even if\nit\u2019s expired,\u201d Netflix says in its help center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost major card providers offer a feature that enables this, including Visa.\nIn 2003, Visa U.S.A. started offering a new software product to merchants\ncalled Visa Account Updater (VAU), according to a 2003 American Banker\narticle. The service works with a network of banks to create a virtual\ntracking service of Americans\u2019 financial profiles. Whenever someone renews, or\nswitches a credit card within their bank, the institution automatically update\nthe VAU. This system lets Netflix and countless other corporations charge\nwhatever card you have on file. It\u2019s a seamless switch that allows the dollars\nto keep flowing toward corporate America, while you don\u2019t have to lift a\nfinger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cVisa understands the challenges faced by merchants when it comes to staying\non top of account information changes,\u201d Visa say in marketing materials to\ncorporations. \u201cVAU delivers updated cardholder account information in a\ntimely, efficient, and cost-effective manner, benefiting all parties involved\nin the electronic payment process.\u201d\n\nVAU was an instant success, quickly adopted by banks and corporations around\nthe world. Visa\u2019s service follows you whenever your issuer switches between\nany major credit card provider, whether it\u2019s Discover, Mastercard, or American\nExpress. However, if you close out an account entirely, or change to a\ndifferent credit card provider yourself, the VAU will simply list your account\nas being closed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome customers of Visa\u2019s tracking service include Netflix, Amazon, Facebook,\nGoogle, and Disney, according to a 256-page list of the software\u2019s adopters\nfrom 2022. VAU allows merchants to keep customers roped into their\nsubscription services, but Visa also argues it helps customers.\n\n\u201cVisa Account Updater (VAU) was built to help ease the burden on consumers of\ninputting a new account number and expiration date in recurring\nsubscriptions,\u201d said a Visa spokesperson in a statement to Gizmodo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVisa\u2019s not entirely wrong about this. If your electricity or internet bill is\ntied to your credit card, you could be in a real bind if you forget to update\nyour new card. However, practices like these can also keep people bound in\nendless cycles of payments that follow them everywhere.\n\n\u201cThe issuing bank determines whether to provide updated card information or to\nprovide a closed account or contact cardholder advice through VAU,\u201d said the\nspokesperson. \u201cVAU only provides information to merchants at the direction of\nthe issuing financial institution and only for merchants where the cardholder\nhas already stored their payment credentials.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOrigins of the Myth\n\nBefore services like VAU popped up, switching your credit card was a pretty\nsurefire way to get out of recurring charges, whether you wanted to or not.\nWhen Bank of America adopted VAU in 2003, it described the product as a\nsolution for billing changes that had once left merchants with \u201cunappealing\nchoices.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOne would be that the merchant would shut off the customer\u2019s service,\u201d said a\nBank of America executive in a 2003 press release. \u201cAnother would be that the\nmerchant would continue the service but send the customer a nasty letter.\u201d\n\nSo VAU really came about with the onset of the internet. Practices like this\nhave become increasingly popular in the Internet age. Subscription services\nhave become easier to start, but increasingly difficult to stop. Recurring\ncharges can truly follow you to the ends of the Earth unless you outright\ncontact the company to stop them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Why It\u2019s Pervasive\n\nVisa\u2019s Account Updater is only really marketed to businesses, so most\nconsumers have no idea it exists. I\u2019d bet most people have no idea there\u2019s a\nway to opt out of Visa\u2019s credit card tracking service, and even fewer know\nthey\u2019re default opted in. It\u2019s largely a hidden service to the average person,\nwith no clear indicator from your bank or subscription service that you\u2019re\nbeing tracked in this way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCredit cards are also widely regarded as a more anonymous way to move through\nthe financial world. While they typically are more secure than using a debit\ncard, make no mistake, banks are still tracking your every move. The VAU just\nallows them to coordinate with corporations to keep your financial information\nconstantly up to date.\n\nThe VAU undoubtedly offers some benefits to consumers. However, it\u2019s important\nto understand why. The system reduces \u201cchurn\u201d for corporations, and ensures\nyou can keep paying them your dollars no matter what\u2019s going on in your\nfinancial world. Banks make it effortless to keep paying these recurring\ncharges. However, stopping them can be much harder. If you really want to stop\na subscription, there\u2019s still no substitute for calling up the company and\ncanceling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "frontpage": false}
