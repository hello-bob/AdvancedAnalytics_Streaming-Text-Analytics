Why do some leading\ngeologists reject the term?\n\nBy Elizabeth Kolbert\n\nApril 20, 2024\n\nArt works by Aletheia Casey\n\nA few months into the third millennium, a group called the International\nGeosphere-Biosphere Programme (I.G.B.P.) held a meeting in Cuernavaca, Mexico.\nAmong the researchers in attendance was Paul Crutzen, an atmospheric chemist\nbest known for his research on ozone-depleting chemicals, such as\nchlorofluorocarbons. For this work, Crutzen, a Dutchman living in Germany, had\nreceived a Nobel Prize, in 1995. In his Nobel lecture, he noted that, given\nhumanity\u2019s heedlessness, it had got off lightly. Millions of pounds of CFCs\nhad been released into the air before anyone had considered the possible\nconsequences. As a result of the chemicals\u2019 behavior in the stratosphere, a\n\u201chole\u201d had opened up in the ozone layer over Antarctica. But, if CFCs had\nturned out to behave just slightly differently, the hole would have stretched\nfrom pole to pole before scientists had even had the tools to measure it.\n\n\u201cI can only conclude that mankind has been extremely lucky,\u201d Crutzen said.\n\nAt the I.G.B.P. meeting in Cuernavaca, Crutzen found himself growing agitated.\nHis colleagues kept referring to the Holocene, the geological epoch that began\nat the close of the last ice age, about twelve thousand years ago. At the dawn\nof the Holocene, the global population was maybe four million\u2014barely enough to\nfill a city like Sydney or St. Petersburg. By the time of the meeting in\nMexico, there were more than six billion people on the planet, and human\nactivity was fundamentally altering such basic Earth processes as the carbon\ncycle.\n\n### Daily\n\nOur flagship newsletter highlights the best of The New Yorker, including top\nstories, fiction, humor, and podcasts.\n\n\u201cStop using the word \u2018Holocene,\u2019 \u201d Crutzen blurted out. \u201cWe\u2019re not in the\nHolocene any more. We\u2019re in the . . . \u201d He paused, searching for the right\nword. \u201cWe\u2019re in the Anthropocene!\u201d During the next coffee break, Crutzen\u2019s\nneologism was the main topic of conversation. Someone suggested that he\ncopyright the term.\n\nAs it turned out, the Anthropocene wasn\u2019t Crutzen\u2019s to claim. Eugene Stoermer,\na biologist at the University of Michigan, had coined the word back in the\nnineteen-eighties, out of much the same frustration. Crutzen got in touch with\nStoermer, and the two wrote an essay for the I.G.B.P. newsletter, laying out\ntheir case for a new age. Human activities, the pair argued, were altering the\nplanet faster and more dramatically than the geological forces that had shaped\nit for most of its history.\n\n\u201cIt seems to us more than appropriate to emphasize the central role of\nmankind\u201d by using \u201cthe term \u2018anthropocene\u2019 for the current geological epoch,\u201d\nthe pair wrote. Not many people read the I.G.B.P. newsletter, so in 2002\nCrutzen refashioned the essay for the journal Nature. He listed some of the\nways that humans were altering the planet: chopping down rain forests, messing\nwith the climate, and manufacturing novel chemicals, such as CFCs. Once again,\nCrutzen stressed how fortunate humanity had been so far. Had the ozone layer\nsustained more damage, large parts of the world could have been rendered\nuninhabitable. \u201cMore by luck than by wisdom, this catastrophic situation did\nnot develop,\u201d he observed.\n\nMany researchers found Crutzen and Stoermer\u2019s term useful. Soon the word\n\u201cAnthropocene\u201d began popping up in scientific papers. This, in turn, piqued\nthe interest of stratigraphers\u2014the subset of geologists who maintain the\nplanet\u2019s official timetable, the International Chronostratigraphic Chart. Had\nthe Earth really entered a new epoch, in the stratigraphic sense of the term?\nAnd, if so, when? The International Commission on Stratigraphy (I.C.S.) set up\nthe Anthropocene Working Group (A.W.G.) to look into the matter. It was still\nworking away last month, when, in a vote that one group member described to me\nas \u201cPutinesque,\u201d a subcommittee of the I.C.S. decided against adding the\nAnthropocene to the timetable. The vote might have marked the end of the\nstory, were it not that it was probably just the beginning. As another\ngeologist put it to me, \u201cVoting down the Anthropocene is a bit like trying to\nvote down plate tectonics. It\u2019s real, it\u2019s there, and we are going to have to\ndeal with it.\u201d\n\nStratigraphers are used to thinking in vast stretches of time. The\nInternational Chronostratigraphic Chart starts with the Hadean eon, which\nbegan with the birth of the planet, 4.5 billion years ago. The Hadean lasted\nfive hundred million years and was succeeded by the Archean eon, which went on\n(and on and on) for 1.5 billion years. The Permian period spanned nearly fifty\nmillion years, the Cretaceous period eighty million. Within these periods\nthere were many sub-periods\u2014technically known as epochs\u2014which also lasted a\nlong time. The Cisuralian epoch of the Permian, for example, stretched over\ntwenty-six million years.\n\nBut, the closer the chart gets to the present, the narrower the divisions\nbecome. The second most recent geological period, the Neogene, lasted just\ntwenty million years. The current period, the Quaternary, began with the start\nof the ice ages, a mere 2.58 million years ago. The Quaternary is further\ndivided into two epochs\u2014the Pleistocene, which spanned 2.57 million years, and\nthe Holocene, which, for now, is still ongoing.\n\nTo mark the boundaries between the various epochs and periods, the I.C.S.\nrelies on what are formally called \u201cglobal boundary stratotype sections and\npoints\u201d and informally known as \u201cgolden spikes.\u201d For the most part, golden\nspikes are layers of rock that contain evidence of some notable shift in\nEarth\u2019s history\u2014a reversal of the planet\u2019s magnetic poles, say, or the\ndisappearance of a fossilized species. The golden spike for the start of the\nTriassic period, for example, is a layer of rock found in Meishan, China, and\nthe shift it records is a mass extinction that killed off something like\nninety per cent of all species on Earth. (The Chinese have set up a park in\nMeishan, where visitors can view the two-hundred-and-fifty-million-year-old\nrock layer in an exposed cliffside.) With golden spikes, again, the closer you\nget to the present, the more the present intrudes. In the case of the\nHolocene, the golden spike is a layer in an ice core from Greenland that\u2019s\nstored in a freezer in Copenhagen. The layer consists of the compressed\nremains of snow that fell eleven thousand seven hundred years ago, which\ncorresponds to the end of a cold snap known as the Younger Dryas.\n\nWith the exception of the Holocene, the start dates for geological ages have\nbeen determined millions of years after the fact. This means that whatever\nsignal is being used to set them has withstood the test of time. The rocks of\nthe Anthropocene, of course, do not yet exist. When the Anthropocene Working\nGroup was formed, in 2009, its first task was to decide whether human impacts\non the planet would still be discernible millions of years from now.\n\nVideo From The New Yorker\n\nRoger J. Carter: Rebel Revolutionary\n\nAfter several years of study, the group decided that the answer was yes. The\ncarbon emissions from burning fossil fuels will leave a permanent signature in\nthe rocks of the future, as will the fallout from nuclear testing. Novel\necosystems that people have created by moving plants and animals around the\nworld will produce novel fossil assemblages. Meanwhile, traces of some of the\ntrillions of tons of stuff humans have generated, from transistors to tanker\nships, will be preserved, meaning that a whole new class of fossils will\nappear in the record\u2014so-called technofossils. Before aluminum smelting was\ninvented, in the nineteenth century, aluminum existed on Earth only in\ncombination with other elements. Future geologists will thus be able to\ndistinguish the current epoch via the remains of beer cans\u2014the Bud Light\nlayer.\n\nThese and other \u201cdistinctive attributes of the recent geological record\nsupport the formalization of the Anthropocene as a stratigraphic entity,\u201d\nmembers of the A.W.G. noted in a paper that appeared in Science in 2016.\n\nWhen Crutzen and Stoermer initially proposed the Anthropocene, they suggested\nthat it had begun with the first stirrings of the Industrial Revolution, in\nthe late eighteenth century. The A.W.G. considered this possibility, but\nultimately rejected it. In the decades following the Second World War,\nresource consumption skyrocketed\u2014a development that\u2019s become known as the\nGreat Acceleration. The fantastic growth in the production of new materials\nsuch as aluminum and plastic, the group decided, made a date closer to 1950 a\nmore logical starting point for the new epoch.\n\nLast summer, under pressure from the International Commission on Stratigraphy\nto finish its work, the A.W.G. announced its proposal for a golden spike. It\nchose a marker similar to the one used for the base of the Holocene, although,\nin this case, the core came not from an ice sheet but from a lake bottom.\n\nCrawford Lake, which is about thirty miles southwest of Toronto, is what\u2019s\nknown as meromictic, which means that its top and bottom waters don\u2019t mix. As\na result of this and other unusual qualities, everything that falls into the\nlake, from pollen grains to radioactive particles, gets preserved in layers of\nsediment that can be very precisely dated. The idea was to designate the base\nof the Anthropocene as the layer of Crawford Lake sediment laid down in\n1952\u2014and, more specifically, as the 1952 layer preserved in one particular\ncore kept in a freezer in Quebec. (The United States conducted the first\nH-bomb tests in 1952, and the fallout from these clearly shows up in the lake\nbed as a spike in plutonium.) The working group announced its choice of the\nCrawford Lake core while stratigraphers from around the world were gathered\nfor a conference in Lille, France. But, in a sign of things to come, the group\nwas barred from making the announcement at the conference hall and had to rent\na room in a nearby hotel.\n\nIn the roughly two and a half centuries since the field of geology was\nfounded, debates over dividing time have often turned nasty. In the eighteen-\nthirties, for example, several of Britain\u2019s most prominent geologists traded\ninsults in a dispute over rocks from what\u2019s now known as the Devonian period,\nsome four hundred million years ago. One of the parties to the controversy,\nHenry De la Beche, was a talented artist, and he lampooned his critics in a\ncartoon that pictured them facing a man with a large nose.\n\n\u201cThis, gentlemen, is my nose,\u201d the man says.\n\n\u201cMy dear fellow!\u201d the critics respond. \u201cYour account of yourself generally may\nbe very well, but as we have classed you, before we saw you, among men without\nnoses, you cannot possibly have a nose.\u201d\n\nMore recently, a fight over whether the Quaternary period should be absorbed\ninto the Neogene caused a rift in the geological community that took many\nyears\u2014and almost as many votes\u2014to resolve. (At one point, the International\nUnion of Geological Sciences [I.U.G.S.], the parent organization of the\nInternational Commission on Stratigraphy, withheld funding from the I.C.S.\nover its handling of the dispute.) The Quaternary managed to survive, but many\ngeologists who work on the Neogene viewed the decision as wrongheaded, and,\nafter the final vote was taken, in 2009, petitioned to have it overturned.\n\n\u201cYou come to the Neogene-Quaternary boundary, and there is nothing there,\u201d one\nstratigrapher complained to Nature.\n\nEven given this history, the fight over the Anthropocene has been a bitter\none. On one side are those geologists who argue, \u00e0 la Stoermer and Crutzen,\nthat human activity has so altered the planet that it no longer makes sense to\nsay we live in the Holocene. The most outspoken members of this camp\ntend\u2014perhaps not surprisingly\u2014to be members of the Anthropocene Working Group.\n\n\u201cTo suddenly have these changes and still call it the Holocene, it becomes a\nlittle bit like the way some oceanographers talk about coral reefs,\u201d Jan\nZalasiewicz, a British geologist who led the Anthropocene Working Group for\nmany years, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s become a kind of zombie epoch. It\u2019s formally still\nhere, but the conditions that characterized it no longer exist.\u201d\n\nIn the other camp are those who argue that the Anthropocene, pretty much by\ndefinition, lies outside the purview of stratigraphy.\n\n\u201cThe stratigraphic record is the past,\u201d Stanley Finney, a geologist at\nCalifornia State University who\u2019s also the secretary-general of the\nInternational Union of Geological Sciences, wrote with Lucy Edwards, a\nstratigrapher with the U.S. Geological Survey. The Anthropocene, by contrast,\n\u201cis the present and future.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we would need to look back on to understand whether this\nboundary has a function,\u201d Philip Gibbard, a professor emeritus at the\nUniversity of Cambridge who\u2019s now the secretary-general of the I.C.S., told\nme. \u201cThose who propose the boundary would say, Well, the Anthropocene is going\nto continue on into the future. But I\u2019m afraid we don\u2019t deal with the future\nas geologists. We only deal with what's preserved in the rock record.\u201d\n\nThe simmering conflict came to a boil this past winter. As with many such\ndisputes, this one morphed from a substantive argument into a procedural one.\nThe members of the A.W.G. felt that they\u2019d been railroaded by the I.C.S. into\nsubmitting a formal proposal before they were ready to. They also complained\nthat, in the run-up to the vote, Anthropocene proponents, including\nZalasiewicz, had been sidelined. (At the time, Zalasiewicz was the chairman of\nthe voting subcommittee\u2014the I.C.S.\u2019s Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy\n[S.Q.S.]\u2014and the vote was held over his objections.)\n\n\u201cIt was like a palace coup, basically,\u201d Colin Waters, the chairman of the\nA.W.G. at the time, told me.\n\nThe final tally\u2014twelve against declaring a new epoch, four in favor, and two\nabstentions\u2014was released to the Times before most members of the A.W.G. had\nlearned of it. Zalasiewicz\u2014who, along with one of the other subcommittee\nmembers, had refused to cast a ballot\u2014questioned the legitimacy of the tally\non several grounds, including the fact that he, the chair, had not called it.\nHis objections were quickly brushed aside by the I.C.S.\u2019s governing board.\n\n\u201cQuest to declare Anthropocene an epoch descends into epic row,\u201d a headline in\nthe Guardian read.\n\n\u201cI can assure you that the claims that have been made by certain members of\nthe Anthropocene Working Group are rubbish,\u201d Gibbard, who, in addition to\nserving on the I.C.S. executive board, is a member of the Quaternary\nsubcommission, told me. \u201cThey\u2019re just sore losers. The trouble is that the\nAnthropocene Working Group had developed into nothing more than a\u2014what can I\nsay?\u2014kind of a cult.\u201d\n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, I should note that I am an Anthropocene\npartisan. This is not to say I have any particular knowledge of stratigraphy\n(though, with Zalasiewicz, I once visited the golden spike for the base of the\nSilurian period, a layer of rock in a cliffside in Scotland). It\u2019s that I find\nthe Anthropocene a helpful neologism\u2014indeed, a necessary one. It\u2019s a succinct\nway of communicating a messy and profoundly consequential reality. Human\nactivity has become the major driver of change on Earth. And many of the ways\nin which we\u2019re transforming the planet\u2014by driving once-widespread species\nextinct or spreading microplastics around the globe\u2014are irreversible across\ntimescales both human and geological.\n\nThe term\u2019s utility is, presumably, the reason that it was so widely adopted\nfollowing Crutzen\u2019s outburst. And its wide adoption, in turn, helps to explain\nwhy the recent I.C.S. debate became so charged.\n\nMost laypeople don\u2019t much care about, say, the start date of the Pleistocene.\n(It was recently moved back almost eight hundred thousand years.) Such\nabstruse questions seem far removed from present-day concerns. But the debate\nabout the Anthropocene is about the present. It\u2019s where stratigraphy meets the\nnews cycle. Long before the I.C.S. had a chance to rule on it, the\nAnthropocene had become the subject of movies, books, and art exhibitions. The\nwork of the A.W.G., meanwhile, was generously covered in the press. When the\nworking group announced its decision to plant a golden spike in Crawford Lake,\noutlets from the Hindustan Times to Deutsche Welle ran stories on the choice.\n\nMany geologists born before the proposed Anthropocene start date seem to have\nbegrudged the would-be time period all this attention. \u201cThe Anthropocene epoch\nwas pushed through the media from the beginning\u2014a publicity drive,\u201d Finney,\nthe I.U.G.S. secretary-general, observed to Science dismissively.\n\nThe future of the Anthropocene as an official stratigraphic unit is, at this\npoint, unclear. The A.W.G. dissolved after the vote, but, as several members\nof the group pointed out to me, the leadership of the I.C.S. is due to turn\nover this summer, after the quadrennial International Geological Congress, set\nto take place in South Korea. Kim Cohen, a Dutch geologist who, at fifty, is\none of the younger members of the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy and\nwho cast a \u201cyes\u201d vote for the new epoch, told me that he expects to see the\nAnthropocene added to the geological timescale within his life.\n\n\u201cI think many of my fellow S.Q.S. members will not see it,\u201d he added by way of\nclarification.\n\nBut the Anthropocene\u2019s future as an informal time period is assured. It\u2019s too\napt\u2014and too important\u2014a term to be abandoned. As Paul Crutzen pointed out in\n2002, barring a \u201cmeteorite impact, a world war or a pandemic,\u201d humans \u201cwill\nremain a major environmental force for many millennia.\u201d Science recently\nsummed up the situation this way: \u201cThe Anthropocene is dead. Long live the\nAnthropocene.\u201d\n\nCrutzen died in 2021, so it\u2019s impossible to know what he would have said about\nthe recent I.C.S. vote. I imagine, though, that he would have responded to it\nmuch as he did to a question I posed to him back in 2010. What was important\nabout the Anthropocene, he told me at that time, was not whether it was\nincluded in geology texts, but whether it prompted people to think more\ncarefully about the consequences of their collective actions.\n\n\u201cWhat I hope,\u201d he said, \u201cis that the term \u2018Anthropocene\u2019 will be a warning to\nthe world.\u201d \u2666\n\n## More Science and Technology\n\n  * Can we stop runaway A.I.?\n\n  * Saving the climate will depend on blue-collar workers.
