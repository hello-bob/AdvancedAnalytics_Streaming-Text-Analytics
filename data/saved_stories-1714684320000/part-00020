For an overview of getting\nstarted & features see this documentation. For a lengthier post and intro see\nour blog post.\n\n## One operational UI for all your dataflows\n\nThe Hamilton UI is a system that provides the following capabilities:\n\n  1. Execution tracking with associated metadata\n\n     * Provides a persistent database to store/manage these\n     * Provides a server that allows reading/writing/authentication\n  2. Data/artifact observability: provides telemetry/observability of Hamilton executions + specific function results/code through a web interface\n  3. Lineage & provenance: allows you to quickly inspect how code and data is connected.\n  4. Catalog: everything is observed and cataloged, so you can quickly search and find what exists and when it was run.\n\nThe UI is meant to monitor/debug Hamilton dataflows both in development and\nproduction. The aim is to enable dataflow authors to move faster during all\nphases of the software development lifecycle.\n\n### Execution Tracking\n\nSee what's slow (left), pinpoint errors (middle) compare execution performance\n(right)\n\n### Data/Aritfact Observability\n\nVisualize data for a run (left), track code the run used (middle) compare data\nacross executions (right)\n\n### Lineage & Provenance\n\nSee how things connect: what's upstream/downstream (left), walk through code\nvisually (right)\n\n### Catalog\n\nUnderstand artifacts produced (left), find features and when they were used\n(right)\n\n## Getting started\n\nMake sure you have docker running:\n\n    \n    \n    # clone the repository if you haven't git clone https://github.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton # change into the UI directory cd hamilton/ui # run docker ./deployment/run.sh\n\nOnce docker is running navigate to http://localhost:8242 and create an email\nand a project; then follow instructions on integrating with Hamilton.\n\nA fuller guide can be found here.\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe architecture is simple.\n\nThe tracking server stores data on postgres, as well as any blobs on s3. This\nis stored in a docker volume on local mode. The frontend is a simple React\napplication. There are a few authentication/ACL capabilities, but the default\nis to use local/unauthenticated (open). Please talk to us if you have a need\nfor more custom authentication.\n\n## License\n\nThere are a few directories that are not licensed under the BSD-3 Clear Clause\nlicense. These are:\n\n  * frontend/src/ee\n  * backend/server/trackingserver_auth\n\nSee the main repository LICENSE for details, else the LICENSE file in the\nrespective directories mentioned above.\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
