Here\u2019s How We Lost America\u2019s Trust.\u201d \u2014 the NPR veteran\nsounded off about the outlet\u2019s increasingly \u201cliberal bent.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true NPR has always had a liberal bent, but during most of my tenure\nhere, an open-minded, curious culture prevailed,\u201d Berliner wrote. \u201cWe were\nnerdy, but not knee-jerk, activist, or scolding. In recent years, however,\nthat has changed. ... An open-minded spirit no longer exists within NPR, and\nnow, predictably, we don\u2019t have an audience that reflects America. That\nwouldn\u2019t be a problem for an openly polemical news outlet serving a niche\naudience. But for NPR, which purports to consider all things, it\u2019s devastating\nboth for its journalism and its business model.\u201d\n\nIn an interview published Tuesday, Berliner told Folkenflik, \u201cI love NPR and\nfeel it\u2019s a national trust. We have great journalists here. If they shed their\nopinions and did the great journalism they\u2019re capable of, this would be a much\nmore interesting and fulfilling organization for our listeners.\u201d\n\nThe move comes amid heavy criticism from conservatives about NPR\u2019s new CEO,\nKatherine Maher. Right-leaning pundits on social media have uncovered posts\nfrom Maher in which she \u2014 among other things \u2014 appeared to downplay rioting\nduring social justice protests.\n\n\u201cIn America everyone is entitled to free speech as a private citizen,\u201d Maher\nsaid in a statement published by NPR. \u201cWhat matters is NPR\u2019s work and my\ncommitment as its CEO: public service, editorial independence, and the mission\nto serve all of the American public. NPR is independent, beholden to no party,\nand without commercial interests.\u201d\n\nThe newly-suspended Berliner told Folkenflik, \u201cWe\u2019re looking for a leader\nright now who\u2019s going to be unifying and bring more people into the tent and\nhave a broader perspective on, sort of, what America is all about. And this\nseems to be the opposite of that.\u201d\n\nHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com\n\nFiled Under:\n\nDavid FolkenflikNPRUri Berliner\n\nPrevious PostNext Post\n\nPrevious PostNext Post\n\nJoe DePaolo - Senior Editor\n\nJoe DePaolo is a Senior Editor at Mediaite.
