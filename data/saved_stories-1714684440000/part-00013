While DARPA has\nbeen happy to release some details about the sub, the agency has been a bit\ncoy about very basic information about specifications and performance.\n\nMore Stories\n\nTechnology\n\nAI voice analysis gives suicide hotline workers an emotional dashboard\n\nThe Manta Ray is set to play a lead role in a new class of UUVs that are long\nrange and long duration, as well as capable of handling a wide variety of\npayloads. It can also be shipped in sections in standard containers and\nassembled where needed, without taking up space at piers or naval facilities.\nIn this way, it can be quickly deployed without wasting time and wear in\ntransit.\n\nThe Manta Ray on the surface\n\nNorthrop Grumman\n\nFrom the presence of people and a small boat in the images, we can see that\nthe Manta Ray isn't small. It also has a stern that seems to have shrouded\npropulsors and perhaps thrusters for maneuvering. Along with this, there are\nprotuberances that are likely some sort of antenna, water inlets, and a\ngeneral shape that indicates that it's designed to glide through the water in\nthe most energy efficient way.\n\nIn other words, more is going into endurance than speed.\n\nAccording to primary contractor Northrop Grumman, the Manta Ray has a modular\nconstruction and energy-saving systems that include the ability to anchor\nitself on the sea floor and go into hibernation mode. There are low-power\nundersea propulsion systems, new sensors for underwater detection and\nclassification of threats and hazards, high-efficiency navigation and command\nand control systems, and cutting-edge anti-biofouling and material degradation\napproaches.\n\nDARPA program manager Dr. Kyle Woerner (right) talks with a member of the\nNorthrop Grumman team while standing atop the Manta Ray vehicle\n\nNorthrop Grumman\n\nThis first test period, which took place in February and March, focused on the\nManta Ray's hydrodynamic performance while submerged, and the operation of the\npropulsion, steering, buoyancy, propellers, and control surfaces. The tests\nalso included the portability of the sub as Manta Ray was disassembled and\npacked in five standard shipping containers before being sent from Northrop\nGrumman's Maryland facility to California.\n\n\"Our successful, full-scale Manta Ray testing validates the vehicle\u2019s\nreadiness to advance toward real-world operations after being rapidly\nassembled in the field from modular subsections,\" said Dr. Kyle Woerner, DARPA\nprogram manager for Manta Ray. \"The combination of cross-country modular\ntransportation, in-field assembly, and subsequent deployment demonstrates a\nfirst-of-kind capability for an extra-large UUV.\n\n\"Shipping the vehicle directly to its intended area of operation conserves\nenergy that the vehicle would otherwise expend during transit,\" he added.\n\"Once deployed, the vehicle uses efficient, buoyancy-driven gliding to move\nthrough the water.The craft is designed with several payload bays of multiple\nsizes and types to enable a wide variety of naval mission sets.\"\n\nSource: DARPA\n\nView gallery - 3 images\n\n## Tags\n\nMilitaryDARPANorthrop GrummanUnderwater dronesNaval\nWarfareSubmarineRoboticsWarfare\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * LinkedIn\n\nNo comments\n\nDavid Szondy\n\nDavid Szondy is a playwright, author and journalist based in Seattle,\nWashington.
