However, this suicide program\nincreasingly resembles a dystopian replacement for care services, exchanging\nsocial welfare for euthanasia.\n\nDoctors and family members gather around a patient's hospital bed who has\ndecided on euthanasia on February 1, 2024.

That\u2019s the story, in sum, of a\nquadriplegic man who chose to end his life in January through medically\nassisted death. Normand Meunier\u2019s story, as reported by the CBC, began with a\nvisit to a Quebec hospital due to a respiratory virus. Meunier subsequently\ndeveloped a painful bedsore after being left without access to a mattress to\naccommodate his needs. Thereafter, he applied to Canada\u2019s Medical Assistance\nin Dying (MAiD) program.\n\nAs Rachel Watts writes in her report, Meunier spent ninety-five hours on a\nstretcher in the emergency room \u2014 just hours short of four days. The bedsore\nhe developed \u201ceventually worsened to the point where bone and muscle were\nexposed and visible \u2014 making his recovery and prognosis bleak.\u201d The man who\n\u201cdidn\u2019t want to be a burden\u201d chose to die at home. An internal investigation\ninto the matter is underway.\n\nDisability and other advocates have been warning us for years that MAiD puts\npeople at risk. They warned that the risk of people choosing death \u2014 because\nit\u2019s easier than fighting to survive in a system that impoverishes people, and\ndisproportionately does so to those who are disabled \u2014 is real.\nUnderinvestment in medical care will push people up to and beyond the brink,\nwhich means some will choose to die instead of \u201cburden\u201d their loved ones or\nsociety at large. They were right.\n\n# MAiD as the Failed Social Welfare State\n\nCanada now has one of the highest assisted-death rates in the world. As the\nGuardian reported in February, 4.1 percent of deaths in the country were\nphysician-assisted \u2014 and the number is growing, up 30 percent between 2021 and\n2022. In a survey of just over 13,100 people who opted for MAiD, a significant\nmajority \u2014 96.5 percent \u2014 chose to end their lives in the face of terminal\nillness or imminent death, Leyland Cecco, author of the report, noted. But 463\nchose it in the face of \u201ca chronic condition.\u201d\n\nA libertarian ethos partially underwrote the fact that not many people blinked\nwhen MAiD was initially rolled out. Taking a more expansive view of rights,\nmany of those not swayed by rote libertarianism were convinced that concerns\nover bodily autonomy and compassion were reason enough to adopt MAiD. However,\nin the absence of a robust welfare state, and in the face of structural\npoverty and discrimination, particularly toward disabled people, there is no\nworld in which the MAiD program can be understood to be \u201cprogressive.\u201d\n\nIndeed, last year, Jeremy Appel argued that MAiD was \u201cbeginning to look like a\ndystopian end run around the cost of providing social welfare.\u201d Initially\nsupportive, he changed his mind on MAiD as he considered that the decisions\npeople make are not strictly speaking individual but are instead collectively\nshaped and sometimes \u201cthe product of social circumstances, which are outside\nof their control.\u201d When we don\u2019t care for one another, what do we end up with?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to realize,\u201d wrote Appel, \u201cthat euthanasia in Canada represents the\ncynical endgame of social provisioning with the brutal logic of late-stage\ncapitalism \u2014 we\u2019ll starve you of the funding you need to live a dignified life\n[. . .] and if you don\u2019t like it, why don\u2019t you just kill yourself?\u201d\n\nBracketing the question of whether the program should even exist at all,\npermitting those suffering from mental illness to access a suicide program \u2014\nwhich the government was prepared to allow before rescheduling the\ncontroversial expansion of the law until 2027 \u2014 is the stuff of nightmarish\nscience fiction. We can instead focus on the absurd and disturbing reality\nthat our underfunded and subpar administration of care in Canada has led some\nup to, and through, the door of assisted death. As things stand, more will\nfollow. It\u2019s grotesque.\n\nIn Canada\u2019s most populous province, Ontario, a recipient of disability support\nreceives about $1,300 a month \u2014 a pittance they\u2019re meant to stretch to cover\nfood, shelter, and other basic needs. Ontario Works \u2014 the province\u2019s welfare\nprogram \u2014 pays a current maximum of $733 a month. Meanwhile, rental costs for\na one bedroom apartment routinely push toward an average of $2,000 a month in\nmany cities. In April, in Toronto, a one bedroom apartment averaged almost\n$2,500 a month.\n\n# Euthanized by the State\n\nIn a 2023 paper in the Canadian Medical Association Journal entitled \u201cWhat\nDrives Requests for MAiD?\u201d James Downar and Susan MacDonald argue that\n\n> [d]espite fears that availability of MAiD for people with terminal illness\n> would lead to requests for MAiD driven by socioeconomic deprivation or poor\n> service availability (e.g., palliative care), available evidence\n> consistently indicates that MAiD is most commonly received by people of high\n> socioeconomic status and lower support needs, and those with high\n> involvement of palliative care.\n\nBy their own admission, the data on this matter is imperfect. But even if it\nwere, the fact that \u201cmost\u201d patients who choose MAiD are better off\nsocioeconomically is beside the point. Some are not \u2014 and those \u201csome\u201d are\nimportant. That includes a man living with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis who,\nin 2019, chose medically assisted death because he couldn\u2019t find adequate\nmedical care that would also allow him to be with his son. It also includes a\nman whose application listed only \u201chearing loss,\u201d and whose brother says he\nwas \u201cbasically put to death.\u201d This story came a year after experts raised the\nconcern that the country\u2019s MAiD regime was in violation of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights.\n\nIn 2022, Global News said the quiet part out loud: poverty is driving disabled\nCanadians to consider MAiD. Those \u201csome\u201d who are driven to assisted death\nbecause of poverty or an inability to access adequate care deserve to live\nwith dignity and with the resources they need to live as they wish. They\nshould never, ever feel the pressure to choose to die because our social\nwelfare institutions are starved and our health care system has been\nvandalized through years of austerity and poor management.\n\nGiven the way our institutions and economic and political elite create and\nperpetuate poverty in Canada, particularly among disabled people, we should be\nparticularly sensitive to the implications of the country\u2019s MaiD regime for\nthose who are often ignored when warning about the dangers of the law.\n\nThe fact that we collectively have the wealth, means, and resources to address\nendemic poverty and provide adequate care to all but choose not to while any\nnumber of poor and disabled people are euthanized by the state is profane.\n\n# For Whom the Bell Doesn\u2019t Toll\n\nIn a February piece for the Globe and Mail, University of Toronto law\nprofessor Trudo Lemmens wrote, \u201cThe results of our MAiD regime\u2019s promotion of\naccess to death as a benefit, and the trivialization of death as a harm to be\nprotected against, are increasingly clear.\u201d In critiquing MAiD\u2019s second track,\nwhich allows physician-assisted death for those who do not face \u201ca reasonably\nforeseeable death,\u201d Lemmens points out that within two years of its adoption,\n\u201c\u2018track two\u2019 MAiD providers had ended already the lives of close to seven\nhundred disabled people, most of whom likely had years of life left.\u201d\n\nIn raising concerns about expanding MAiD to cover mental illness, Lemmens\nadded that \u201cthere are growing concerns that inadequate social and mental\nhealth care, and a failure to provide housing supports, push people to request\nMAiD,\u201d noting that \u201c[a]dding mental illness as a basis for MAiD will only\nincrease the number of people exposed to higher risks of premature death.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, Gabrielle Peters warned in Maclean\u2019s that extending MAiD to cover\nthose who weren\u2019t facing an immediately foreseeable death was \u201cdangerous,\nunsettling and deeply flawed.\u201d She traced the various ways in which a broader\nMAiD law could lead to people choosing to die in the face of austerity, adding\nan intersectional lens that is often missing from our discussions and debates\nover the issue.\n\nShe warned that we were failing to consider \u201chow poverty and racism intersect\nwith disability to create greater risk of harm, more institutional bias and\nbarriers, additional layers of othering and dehumanization, and fewer\nresources for addressing any of these.\u201d And now here we are. We should have\nlistened more carefully.\n\nWhile MAiD may be defensible as a means for individuals to exercise personal\nchoice in how they live and how they die when facing illness and pain, it is\nplainly indefensible when state-induced austerity and mismanagement leads to\npeople choosing to end their lives that have been made unnecessarily\nmiserable. In short, we are killing people for being poor and disabled, which\nis horrifying.\n\nIt thus falls to proponents of MAiD to show how such deaths can be avoided,\njust as it falls to policymakers to build or rebuild institutions that ensure\nno one ever opts to end their life for lack of resources or support, which we\ncould provide in abundance if we choose to.\n\n#### Share this article\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\n#### Contributors\n\nDavid Moscrop is a writer and political commentator.
