After some time I also enjoyed slightly criticized (and\nnot without a reason) the Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel game.\n\nAfter (long ago) trying the Bethesda Fallout 3 I was more then disappointed. I\nwas devastated. Its such a crook of shit that I lack words on how to describe\nthis bullshit in words that are possible to post here.\n\nIts not about 3D view versus typical Fallout view. Its about the mechanics \u2013\nalso Action Points \u2013 the \u2018balance\u2019 between killing shit in real time versus\nthe Bethesda VATS bullshit, etc.\n\n# Fallout on Silver Screen\n\nRecently I tried the Fallout series made by Amazon. I really enjoyed it. Yes,\nof course its not perfect, it has its flaws, but who is flawless? Nobody.\n\nAfter chick-chat with my close friend \u2013 which recommended that I should again\ntry the \u2018new\u2019 Fallout: New Vegas and just try to follow the story \u2013 I felt\nencouraged and literally just tried it.\n\nFor most of the time \u2013 my Fallout characters tend to use Small Guns or Energy\nWeapons. Sometimes I do a Unarmed build \u2013 but that is not my kind of playing\nFallout \u2013 no matter how \u2018fun\u2019 or effective such build can be.\n\nThe same I did with Fallout: New Vegas game \u2013 pure Energy Weapons build \u2013\nalong with some Science and Lockpick for other skills.\n\n# Lockpick Bullshit\n\nI understand that each skill has its own value and difficulty to use in the\nreal world \u2013 and while I was not able to use Steal at all on the real\n\u2018objects\u2019 \u2013 the only thing that accounted for Steal was getting some stuff\nfrom random houses/building into Your inventory \u2013 I was not able to \u2018Steal\u2018\nstuff from a person standing next to me.\n\n... but the thing that raged me the most was the Lockpick skill. On a classic\n(or original) Fallout 1 and Fallout 2 games its just a skill. You have the\nskill value on the character side and you have the difficulty of the Lockpick\nchallenge on the door/safe that is next in front of You. A simple test and You\neither failed, broke the lock or succeeded opening it ... but not in Bethesda\n(and later Obsidian) world.\n\nYou need to do some dexterity bullshit (I mean in real life) on each lock ...\nbreaking pins ... and THIS is the shit that drove me into the \u2018fuck it\u2019\nattitude.\n\nI really love original Fallout 1/2 series but each time I try to play the\nBethesda (and later Obsidian) Fallout games \u2013 its just such bullshit.\n\nI like to vote with my money \u2013 so I will just stay the fuck away as far as\npossible from this Bethesda/Obsidian bullshit as possible.\n\nI would rather play original Fallout 1/2 for the 100th time instead of wasting\nmy sanity for the Bethesda/Obsidian pseudo ideas.\n\nYou have been warned.\n\n# Battle System\n\n... and do not even get me started on the broken as fuck battle system.\n\nEOF\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nValuable News \u2013 2018/08/11August 11, 2018In \"news\"\n\nValuable News \u2013 2022/05/16May 16, 2022In \"news\"\n\nValuable News \u2013 2022/07/18July 18, 2022In \"news\"\n\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized and tagged bethesda, bullshit, fallout,\ngames, gaming, obisdian, shit on April 18, 2024 by vermaden.\n\n### Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\n  * Comment\n  * Reblog\n  * Subscribe Subscribed\n\n    * vermaden\n    * Already have a WordPress.com account?
