At the\ntime of publication, it represented the best available science.\n\nJanuary 1, 1906JPEG\n\nDuring the first half of the twentieth century, coal burning at power plants,\nfactories, and homes filled the air over the Midwestern U.S. with pollution.\n\u201cSmoke\u201d\u2014as air pollution was usually called\u2014used to occasionally block so much\nsunlight that people were forced to carry lamps in the middle of the day. In\nsome eastern cities, particulate levels likely exceeded 1,000 micrograms per\ncubic meter\u2014about twice as high as they are on a bad air quality day in modern\nBeijing, now one of the most polluted cities in the world.\n\nThe problem was especially bad in Pittsburgh. The hills surrounding the city\nwere filled with bitumen, a type of soft coal that released large quantities\nof sulfate-producing gases, soot, and other pollutants when burned. In 1866,\nan Atlantic Monthly writer visited Pittsburgh and reported: \u201cThe town lies\nlow, as at the bottom of an excavation, just visible through the mingled smoke\nand mist, and every object in it is black. Smoke, smoke, smoke\u2014everywhere\nsmoke.\u201d It was, he wrote, \u201clike looking over into hell with the lid taken\noff.\u201d\n\nThe photograph above, taken in 1906, shows Pittsburgh\u2019s Strip District\nneighborhood looking northwest from the roof of Union Station. The Fort Wayne\nRailroad Bridge spanning the Allegheny River is partly visible on the left.\nThe photograph below is a smoky street-level view of the corner of Liberty and\nFifth Avenues in Pittsburgh in 1940.\n\nJanuary 1, 1940JPEG\n\nIn October 1948, a disastrous outbreak of air pollution occurred in nearby\nDonora, Pennsylvania. What meteorologists call a temperature inversion\u2014warmer\nair moving above cooler air\u2014triggered the crisis. The warm air functioned like\na lid, trapping fumes from steel and zinc smelters and exposing the town\u2019s\n13,000 residents to extremely high levels of sulfate pollution. The inversion\nlasted just four days, but the health consequences were swift: twenty people\ndied and 6,000 suffered serious respiratory problems. Something similar\nhappened in London in December 1952, leading to thousands of respiratory\nproblems and premature deaths.\n\nThe natural-color satellite image below offers both a modern and historical\ncontext. Captured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)\non NASA\u2019s Terra satellite, it shows heavy pollution heading toward Beijing,\nChina, on December 12, 2013. If satellites had been flying in the first half\nof the 20th century, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that skies over the eastern\nUnited States or Europe would have looked something like this on some days.\n\nRead A Clearer View of Hazy Skies to learn more about how air quality has\nchanged over time.\n\nDecember 23, 2013JPEG\n\nNASA image courtesy Jeff Schmaltz, LANCE/EOSDIS MODIS Rapid Response Team at\nNASA GSFC.
