Extracting crude oil from tar sands is a slow,\ndirty, and expensive task, requiring the separation of bitumen\u2014a thick oil\nsubstance\u2014from the sandy peatland of the Canadian forests. Seeking a more\nefficient method, Natland figured that setting off nuclear bombs might make\nthe process easier.\n\nHis idea, later named Project Oilsand, was in line with the nuclear fever\ndreams of the late 1950s and early 1960s, when scientists and politicians in\nCanada, Russia, and the United States were considering all variety of ways of\n\u201ctaming the H-bomb.\u201d (Another government initiative, Project Plowshare,\nchampioned by Edward Teller\u2014\u201cfather of the hydrogen bomb\u201d\u2014was exploring the\nuse of nukes to build canals, dam rivers, and dig for precious metals.)\nSpeaking before the Atomic Energy Research and Development Subcommittee on\nMarch 22, 1960, the president of Richfield Oil, W.J. Travers, proposed\nexploding a nine-kiloton atomic device\u2014just over half the strength of \u201cLittle\nBoy,\u201d the bomb US Air Force pilots dropped on Hiroshima\u20141,300 feet underground\nin the Canadian wilderness. \u201cThe explosion,\u201d said Travers, \u201cwould suddenly\nliberate 9 trillion calories of heat,\u201d as well as, he hoped, lots of oil.\n\nSetting off radioactive bombs under the earth dangerously contaminates the\nwater and surrounding dirt, but Travers told the committee members that \u201cbased\non available information, Canadian and United States scientists who have\ncarefully studied the safety problem are convinced that the proposed 9-kiloton\ntest would not result in harmful effects.\u201d The US government not only approved\nthe proposal but agreed to supply the bomb. The plans were eventually set\naside without being tried\u2014perhaps owing to fear of Russian espionage rather\nthan safety concerns. Yet given the zeal with which humans in the last three\nquarters of a century have found other ways to suck vast amounts of petroleum\nout of the earth, a handful of nukes detonated in the Canadian muskeg would\nhave been just a drop in the barrel of oil\u2019s \u201charmful effects.\u201d\n\nContinue reading for just $1 an issue!\n\nChoose a Digital subscription or our best deal\u2014All Access\u2014that includes print\nand digital issues, full archive access, and the NYR App!\n\nView Offers\n\nOr register for a free account to read just this article.
