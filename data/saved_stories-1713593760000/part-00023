This FAQ addresses common questions and concerns\nregarding these changes.\n\n## Why was I charged more than I was previously?\n\nWe are now collecting sales tax / VAT. If you are in an affected jurisdiction\nthe correct amount of sales tax/VAT is added to your renewal in order to\ncomply with tax laws.\n\n## Why are you collecting sales tax / VAT now?\n\nWe were not required to collect them initially, until hitting certain\nthreshold. Due to Kagi's growth, we are now required by law to collect sales\ntax / VAT in many jurisdictions.\n\n## When will this sales tax / VAT collection start?\n\n  * New users: April 11th, 2024.\n  * Existing users: On the first subscription renewal on/after April 21st, 2024.\n\n## How do you determine what tax percentage to charge me?\n\nWe rely on the billing address you provide at the time of your subscription\npurchase.\n\n## Why does my receipt say the seller is \u201cKagi by Reach US\u201d?\n\nTo efficiently handle the complexity of collecting sales tax globally, we have\npartnered with Reach as our Merchant of Record. They act as a reseller of\nKagi's services, allowing them to manage sales tax / VAT on our behalf.\n\n## I see a charge in my bank statement from \u201cRCH-KAGI.COM\u201d or \u201cRCH-KAGI\u201d, is\nthat a legitimate charge by Kagi?\n\nYes, this is how charges made by Reach on behalf of Kagi will show up in your\nbank statement. You may also see a temporary preauthorization charge of $1 USD\nor $0 USD. This is simply to confirm the validity of your credit card details\nand will disappear within a day or two.\n\n## What if where I live there is no tax for digital services?\n\nYour renewal cost will remain unchanged.\n\n## I\u2019m a tax-exempt entity, can I waive the tax charge?\n\nPlease enter your tax ID in the billing portal and depending on the\njurisdiction taxes may be automatically waived going forward.\n\n## Is there a way to view my upcoming invoice?\n\nYes, please visit the billing portal.\n\n## My billing address is outdated. How can I update it?\n\nPlease visit the billing portal.\n\nEdit this page on GitHub\n\n", "frontpage": false}
