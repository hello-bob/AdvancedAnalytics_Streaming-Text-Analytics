As a byproduct of Chen's result, it\nfollows that Chen's algorithm solves the Gap Shortest Vector Problem, for gap\n. In this short note we point to an error in the claims of Chen's paper.\n\n##### Metadata\n\nAvailable format(s)\n\n    PDF\nCategory\n\n    Attacks and cryptanalysis\nPublication info\n\n    Preprint.\nContact author(s)\n\n    omrishmueli @ mail tau ac il\nHistory\n\n    2024-04-16: approved\n    2024-04-16: received\n    See all versions\nShort URL\n\n    https://ia.cr/2024/583\nLicense\n\n    CC BY\n\nBibTeX\n\n    \n    \n    @misc{cryptoeprint:2024/583, author = {Omri Shmueli}, title = {A Note on Quantum Algorithms for Lattice Problems}, howpublished = {Cryptology ePrint Archive, Paper 2024/583}, year = {2024}, note = {\\url{https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/583}}, url = {https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/583} }\n\nNote: In order to protect the privacy of readers, eprint.iacr.org does not use\ncookies or embedded third party content.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
