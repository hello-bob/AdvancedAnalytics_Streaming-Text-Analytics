Tolkien\u2019s personal life,\nlegendarium, or academic work. This is a multidisciplinary area of study\nencompassing subjects such as literature, linguistics, and gender studies.\nThere are several peer-reviewed journals for Tolkien studies including Mallorn\nby the Tolkien Society, Tolkien Studies, and Journal of Tolkien Research\n(Brennan Croft, 2016).\n\nTolkien himself was an academic, working at the University of Leeds and\nPembroke College, Oxford. His research specialised in Anglo-Saxon Literature\nand Philology. Furthermore, one could argue that fantasy literature and\narchaeology have an intrinsic link, ruins of lost civilisations and magic\nitems \u2013 in fact, the author of the Malazan Books of the Fallen, Steven\nErikson, was an archaeologist before beginning his literary career (Fantasy\nBook Review, 2023).\n\nDespite the seemingly obvious connection to the ancient world, very little has\nbeen published in the way of archaeological research or interpretations of the\nworld of Middle-earth. Some may argue this to be impossible; however, Tolkien\nwrote a magical world and mythos which was full of references from human\nhistory and prehistory.\n\nThis article aims to examine occurrences of archaeology and archaeological\ntechniques in the world of Middle-earth and demonstrate how archaeological\nmethodology can be used in fantasy literature.\n\n# THE RUINS\n\nWhen one thinks of Archaeology as a discipline people often imagine ruins and\nstanding stones; this idea harkens back to the grand tour of the post-medieval\nperiod (Ceserani et al., 2017). In the Narrative, we encounter two main ruins,\nthose of Weathertop and Osgiliath (Tolkien, 2004: 163, 664). Sabo (2007) notes\nruins as part of Tolkien\u2019s rich cultural landscape and places of memory.\n\nFigure 1. Weathertop from the game Lord of the Rings Online (Daybreak Game\nCompany, 2007). Source: LOTR Fandom 2000 (screen capture from the game).\n\nIn the case of Weathertop, it is a memory of a fallen kingdom that only a\nsmall few (the D\u00fanedain) can remember. At one point Aragorn (a bearer of\ncultural burden) educates the hobbits on this fact. Though the idea of the\nLost Kingdom sounds fantastical during the tumultuous early medieval kingdom,\nit was a reality (Williams, 2023). Lost Kingdoms are a reality in Tolkien\u2019s\nlegendarium with the city of Gondolin bearing resemblance to Babylon and the\ntower of Babel (Garth, 2020: 150).\n\nOn the other hand, the ruins of Osgiliath are a city of the extant kingdom of\nGondor. Though still associated with what is lost, they are much more focused\non a kingdom in decline, like the Roman or Byzantine empires (Norwich, 1996).\nFurthermore, the statues of Gondor\u2019s founding father that the party encounters\nharken back to the statue of the classical and Egyptian civilisations such as\nthose described in Ozymandias by P.B. Shelley (Garth, 2020: 143).\n\n# OBJECT BIOGRAPHIES\n\nObject biographies are the study of an item\u2019s \u2018life\u2019 going from its \u2018birth\u2019 or\ncreation to its \u2018death\u2019 or destruction and in some cases it\u2019s \u2018rebirth\u2019 or\nremaking. The idea dates to Kopytoff (1986) and is a way of examining\nrelationships between people and materials as well as spatial relationships\nwith the landscape (Gosden & Marshall, 1999). In Middle-earth there are\nseveral object biographies that can be explored. Middle-earth is based on a\nfantastical prehistory of Earth (Tolkien et al., 2006); thus, all objects\nwould be considered artefacts by modern archaeologists and scholars \u2013 for the\npurpose of this paper we have selected only the objects with significance to\nthe plot.\n\n### The Ring\n\nThe most obvious biography is an item central to the plot, namely the One Ring\n(also called the Ruling Ring and Isildur\u2019s Bane). The plot of The Lord of the\nRings follows a journey, not just of the characters but also of the Ring\nitself. We are given the Ring\u2019s biography with its creation in Mount Doom, its\nacquisition, and then subsequent loss by Isildur, and then its discovery and\nloss by Smeagol (Gollum) in chapter three Of Shadows of the Past (Tolkien,\n2004 [original publication from 1954\u20131955]: 53\u201356). The biography of the ring\nis followed in detail during Tolkien\u2019s first publication, The Hobbit [1937].\nThe One Ring is unusual as an object as Tolkien describes it as having malice\nand even leaving Gollum (Tolkien, 2004: 53; Day, 2020), suggesting a level of\npersonhood in the object, which is unusual for an object biography.\n\nFigure 2. The One Ring from the Peter Jackson Trilogy. Source: LOTR Fandom\n2000 (screen capture from the movie The Fellowship of the Ring, 2001).\n\n### Anduril\n\nAnduril, the sword of Aragorn, is introduced in the chapter The Council of\nRivendell and is made up of the reforged fragments of Narsil. The sword was\nforged by a Dwarven smith before being taken by the N\u00famen\u00f3reans, when it fell\ninto the possession of Elendil. The sword was then shattered during the battle\nwith Sauron, but the shards were used to kill Sauron by Isildur.\n\nIn the Narrative, the sword plays a huge role in Aragorn\u2019s identity as King of\nGondor; he uses it to identify himself and his heritage to \u00c9omer and the other\nriders of Rohan. Swords are shown as identifiers of kingship and warriorhood\nand heritage in early medieval literature. Examples include Excalibur in the\ntales of Arthur and the sword of Wiglaf in Beowulf as opposed to the \u2018Foreign\u2019\nweapons such as the spear G\u00e1e Bulga of C\u00fachulainn (Sayer et al., 2019:\n544\u2013545). Sayer et al. (2019) attribute a person-like quality to swords, which\nin burials are not worn like knives (an indication of utilitarian purpose) but\nindicates them to be a symbol of masculinity and power.\n\n# FUNERARY ARCHAEOLOGY\n\nFunerary Archaeology or Archaeothanatology is the study of mortuary rites,\nburial practice, and death in an archaeological context (Cooney, 2023). This\ncan relate to anything from grave goods and the landscape of burial to\nosteological studies of the dead (Stutz & Tarlow, 2013). In The Lord of the\nRings, there are two instances where funerary archaeological comparisons can\nbe made: the appearance of the Barrow Wight in Fog in the Barrow-Downs and the\ndead men of Dunharrow in The Passing of the Grey Company (Tolkien, 2004: 135,\n773).\n\nFigure 3. The Dead Men of Dunharrow as they appeared in the Peter Jackson\nTrilogy. Source: Tolkien Gateway (screen capture from the movie The Return of\nthe King, 2003).\n\n### The Barrow Wight and Barrows\n\nFog in the Barrow-Downs describes an encounter Frodo, Samwise, Pippin and\nMerry have with an undead creature residing in a Barrow Grave (Tolkien, 2004:\n135\u2013148). Here we see Tolkien\u2019s early medieval literary origins with the\ncreature resembling that of a draugr from Scandinavian folklore (Chadwick,\n1946). Archaeological evidence for the undead in the real world often\ncomprises measures to stop the undead; potential examples of this include cut\nand burn marks on an assemblage of skeletons found at Wharram Percy, Yorkshire\n(Mays et al., 2017). Similarly, there are examples of \u2018Vampire\u2019 burials in\nPoland, though in Tolkien\u2019s legendarium a vampire is a distinctly separate\ncreature from a wight (Betsinger & Scott, 2014). The restless dead are also\nfound in the \u2018Dead Marshes\u2019 though this bears more resemblance to no man\u2019s\nland in the Somme, an unlikely type of funerary archaeology (Garth, 2020:\n165).\n\nBarrows are a common burial practice which dates independently from the Bronze\nAge, Iron Age, and Early Medieval period (Grinsell ,1984; Noort, 1993; Garrow\net al., 2014; Cooney, 2023; Stephens, 2023: 19\u201320). Barrows are shown again\noutside the city of Edoras in Rohan; it is a commonly held consensus that the\nRohirrim are modelled on the Anglo-Saxons (Bates, 2002; Sabo, 2007: 102). So,\nit is likely that the Barrows were built in the manner of those in early\nMedieval England (Noort, 1993). However, the context of burial outside of a\nsettlement resembles that of the Romans (Zachos & Karampa, 2015). In the text\nit says: \u201cAt the foot of the hill the way ran under the shadow of many mounds,\nhigh and green\u201d, \u201cSeven mounds upon the left, and nine upon the right said\nAragorn \u2018Many long lives of men it is since the golden hall was built\u201d\n(Tolkien, 2004: 507).\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon comparison is further emphasised by the burial of Th\u00e9oden\u2019s\nhorse, Snowmane, after his demise alongside his master during the Battle of\nthe Pelennor Fields (Sabo, 2007: 104). Horse burials have been found alongside\nnumerous Anglo-Saxon \u201cwarrior\u201d graves (Cross, 2011). Horse burials have been\nfound in other sites such as the Chariot Burials of Iron Age East Yorkshire\n(Stephens 2023).\n\nThis contrasts to the description of the Barrow-Downs, which are described\ndifferently and in a much more sinister light: \u201che turned his glance eastwards\nand saw that on that side the hills were higher and looked down upon them; and\nall those hills were crowned with green mounds, and on some were standing\nstones, pointing like jagged teeth out of green gums\u201d (Tolkien, 2004: 137).\nThe difference in description may be due to the Rohirrim mounds being that of\nhonoured dead who represent the culture\u2019s proud warrior heritage and identity.\nWhereas the inclusion of standing stones in the Barrow-Downs bears more\nresemblance to the prehistoric passage tombs from the Neolithic and Bronze Age\n(Grinsell, 1984: 17; Cooney, 2023: 200). Furthermore, the hobbits fear the\nbarrows, they are \u2018other\u2019 and outside of the hobbit\u2019s cultural memory, like\nthe attitude of later cultures to the Neolithic stones at Avebury (Gillings &\nPollard, 1999: 186).\n\nThe hobbits also awaken covered in jewels and swords, like those found at\nSutton Hoo \u2013 excavated around a similar time to the writing of The Lord of the\nRings; connections to Beowulf have also been made, which was a work Tolkien\nfamously translated and published (Lindqvist, 1948). The hobbits are gifted\nswords and find out the barrows belonged to the Men of Westernesse \u2013 who were\nbeaten by the kingdom of Angmar. These men were descended from the\nN\u00famen\u00f3reans, a thalassocracy bearing similarity to the Bronze Age Minoans\n(Williams, 2020). Here we also see the object biographies of these objects,\nwhich are brought back from \u201cdeath\u201d by the characters using them; one of those\nswords goes on to help kill the Witch-king of Angmar, fulfilling its purpose\nsymbolically.\n\n### The Dead Men of Dunharrow\n\nThe Dead Men of Dunharrow (also known simply as Oathbreakers) first appear in\nthe chapter The Passing of the Grey Company (Tolkien, 2004: 773). In Appendix\nF, Tolkien notes them as being kin to the wild men of Dr\u00faadan Forest who moved\nto the mountains and became the men of the mountains (Tolkien, 2004: 1025).\nThese men are described as Pre-N\u00famen\u00f3reans, or the indigenous men of Middle-\nearth, and included the Hill-men and Dunlendings. Comparisons can be found\nbetween these groups and Iron Age tribes who lived in Britain when the Romans\nfirst arrived; albeit in a rather dated and Roman depiction of them as\n\u201csavage\u201d.\n\nThe Dead Men are an unusual depiction of funerary archaeology as no bodies are\never shown. Instead, they appear as wraiths, the unrestful dead. This is due\nto their breaking of an oath and past worship of Sauron. Breaking of Oaths is\na common trope in ancient literature and appears many times in Tolkien\u2019s\nnarrative, such as Saruman betraying Gandalf and breaking the law of\nhospitality, a tradition dating back to Homer (Sinex, 2003; Pitt-Rivers,\n2012).\n\n# CONCLUSION\n\nIn conclusion, we have given a brief outline of archaeology in the worlds and\nimagination of Tolkien. Toilkien\u2019s engagement with the past and classical\ntexts, as well as with archaeological discoveries from his time (Sutton Hoo),\nis self-evident from his writing and imagery. However, this article aims to\nhighlight how more recent and specialised archaeological areas of study can be\napplied to Tolkien. Namely, this was done with object biographies and funerary\narchaeology. We found that Tolkien\u2019s rich descriptive prose allows for\ninterpretation of the physical, allowing for easy cultural comparisons to be\nfound.\n\n# REFERENCES\n\nBates, B.
