If the court buys it, this interpretation\ncould make the open web a lot more open, while chipping away at the\ncentralized control of the biggest tech companies. And, yes, that could mean\nthat the law (Section 230) that is wrongly called \u201ca gift to big tech\u201d might\nbe a tool that undermines the dominance of some of those companies. But the\nlawsuit could be tripped up for any number of reasons, including a potentially\nconsequential typo in the law that has been ignored for years.\n\nBuckle in, this is a bit of a wild ride.\n\nYou would think with how much attention has been paid to Section 230 over the\nlast few years (there\u2019s an entire excellent book about it!), and how short the\nlaw is, that there would be little happening with the existing law that would\ntake me by surprise. But the new Zuckerman v. Meta case filed on behalf of\nEthan Zuckerman by the Knight First Amendment Institute has got my attention.\n\nIt\u2019s presenting a fairly novel argument about a part of Section 230 that\nalmost never comes up in lawsuits, but could create an interesting opportunity\nto enable all kinds of adversarial interoperability and middleware to do\ninteresting (and hopefully useful) things that the big platforms have been\nusing legal threats to shut down.\n\nIf the argument works, it may reveal a surprising and fascinating trojan horse\nfor a more open internet, hidden in Section 230 for the past 28 years without\nanyone noticing.\n\nOf course, it could also have much wider ramifications that a bunch of folks\nneed to start thinking through. This is the kind of thing that happens when\nsomeone discovers something new in a law that no one really noticed before.\n\nBut there\u2019s also a very good chance this lawsuit flops for a variety of other\nreasons without ever really exploring the nature of this possible trojan\nhorse. There are a wide variety of possible outcomes here.\n\nBut first, some background.\n\nFor years, we\u2019ve talked about the importance of tools and systems that give\nend users more control over their own experiences online, rather than leaving\nit entirely up to the centralized website owners. This has come up in a\nvariety of different contexts in different ways, from \u201cProtocols, not\nPlatforms\u201d to \u201cadversarial interoperability,\u201d to \u201cmagic APIs\u201d to \u201cmiddleware.\u201d\nThese are not all exactly the same thing, but they\u2019re all directionally\nstrongly related, and conceivably could work well together in interesting\nways.\n\nBut there are always questions about how to get there, and what might stand in\nthe way. One of the biggest things standing in the way over the last decade or\nso has been interpretations of various laws that effectively allow social\nmedia companies to threaten and/or bring lawsuits against companies trying to\nprovide these kinds of additional services. This can take the form of a DMCA\n1201 claim for \u201ccircumventing\u201d a technological block. Or, more commonly, it\nhas taken the form of a civil (Computer Fraud & Abuse Act) CFAA claim.\n\nThe most representative example of where this goes wrong is when Facebook sued\nPower Ventures years ago. Power was trying to build a unified dashboard across\nmultiple social media properties. Users could provide Power with their own\nlogins to social media sites. This would allow Power to log in to retrieve and\npost data, so that someone could interact with their Facebook community\nwithout having to personally go into Facebook.\n\nThis was a potentially powerful tool in limiting Facebook\u2019s ability to become\na walled-off garden with too much power. And Facebook realized that too.\nThat\u2019s why it sued Power, claiming that it violated the CFAA\u2019s prohibition on\n\u201cunauthorized access.\u201d\n\nThe CFAA was designed (poorly and vaguely) as an \u201canti-hacking\u201d law. And you\ncan see where \u201cunauthorized access\u201d could happen as a result of hacking. But\nFacebook (and others) have claimed that \u201cunauthorized access\u201d can also be\n\u201cbecause we don\u2019t want you to do that with your own login.\u201d\n\nAnd the courts have agreed to Facebook\u2019s interpretation, with a few\nlimitations (that don\u2019t make that big of a difference).\n\nI still believe that this ability to block interoperability/middleware with\nlaw has been a major (perhaps the most major) reason \u201cbig tech\u201d is so big.\nThey\u2019re able to use these laws to block out the kinds of companies who would\nmake the market more competitive and pull down some the walls of walled\ngardens.\n\nThat brings us to this lawsuit.\n\nEthan Zuckerman has spent years trying to make the internet a better, more\nopen space (partially, I think, in penance for creating the world\u2019s first pop-\nup internet ad). He\u2019s been doing some amazing work on reimagining the digital\npublic infrastructure, which I keep meaning to write about, but never quite\nfind the time to get to.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, he wants to build a tool called \u201cUnfollow Everything\n2.0.\u201d The tool is based on a similar tool, also called Unfollow Everything,\nthat was built by Louis Barclay a few years ago and did what it says on the\ntin: let you automatically unfollow everything on Facebook. Facebook sent\nBarclay a legal threat letter and banned him for life from the site.\n\nZuckerman wants to recreate the tool with some added features enabling users\nto opt-in to provide some data to researchers about the impact of not\nfollowing anyone on social media. But he\u2019s concerned that he\u2019d face legal\nthreats from Meta, given what happened with Barclay.\n\n> Using Unfollow Everything 2.0, Professor Zuckerman plans to conduct an\n> academic research study of how turning off the newsfeed affects users\u2019\n> Facebook experience. The study is opt-in\u2014users may use the tool without\n> participating in the study. Those who choose to participate will donate\n> limited and anonymized data about their Facebook usage. The purpose of the\n> study is to generate insights into the impact of the newsfeed on user\n> behavior and well-being: for example, how does accessing Facebook without\n> the newsfeed change users\u2019 experience? Do users experience Facebook as less\n> \u201caddictive\u201d? Do they spend less time on the platform? Do they encounter a\n> greater variety of other users on the platform? Answering these questions\n> will help Professor Zuckerman, his team, and the public better understand\n> user behavior online and the influence that platform design has on that\n> behavior\n>\n> The tool and study are nearly ready to launch. But Professor Zuckerman has\n> not launched them because of the near certainty that Meta will pursue legal\n> action against him for doing so.\n\nSo he\u2019s suing for declaratory judgment that he\u2019s not violating any laws. If he\nwere just suing for declaratory judgment over the CFAA, that would (maybe?) be\nsomewhat understandable or conventional. But, while that argument is in the\nlawsuit, the main claim in the case is something very, very different. It\u2019s\nusing a part of Section 230, section (c)(2)(B), that almost never gets\nmentioned, let alone tested.\n\nMost Section 230 lawsuits involve (c)(1): the famed \u201c26 words\u201d that state \u201cNo\nprovider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the\npublisher or speaker of any information provided by another information\ncontent provider.\u201d\n\nSome Section 230 cases involve (c)(2)(A) which states that \u201cNo provider or\nuser of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of any\naction voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability\nof material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd,\nlascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise\nobjectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.\u201d\nMany people incorrectly think that Section 230 cases turn on this part of the\nlaw, when really, much of those cases are already cut off by (c)(1) because\nthey try to treat a service as a speaker or publisher.\n\nBut then there\u2019s (c)(2)(B), which says:\n\n> No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable\n> on account of any action taken to enable or make available to information\n> content providers or others the technical means to restrict access to\n> material described in paragraph (1)\n\nAs noted, this basically never comes up in cases. But the argument being made\nhere is that this creates some sort of proactive immunity from lawsuits for\nmiddleware creators who are building tools (\u201ctechnical means\u201d) to \u201crestrict\naccess.\u201d In short: does Section 230 protect \u201cUnfollow Everything\u201d from\nbasically any legal threats from Meta, because it\u2019s building a tool to\nrestrict access to content on Meta platforms?\n\nOr, according to the lawsuit:\n\n> This provision would immunize Professor Zuckerman from civil liability for\n> designing, releasing, and operating Unfollow Everything 2.0\n>\n> First, in operating Unfollow Everything 2.0, Professor Zuckerman would\n> qualify as a \u201cprovider . . . of an interactive computer service.\u201d The CDA\n> defines the term \u201cinteractive computer service\u201d to include, among other\n> things, an \u201caccess software provider that provides or enables computer\n> access by multiple users to a computer server,\u201d id. \u00a7 230(f)(2), and it\n> defines the term \u201caccess software provider\u201d to include providers of software\n> and tools used to \u201cfilter, screen, allow, or disallow content.\u201d Professor\n> Zuckerman would qualify as an \u201caccess software provider\u201d because Unfollow\n> Everything 2.0 enables the filtering of Facebook content\u2014namely, posts that\n> would otherwise appear in the feed on a user\u2019s homepage. And he would\n> \u201cprovide[] or enable[] computer access by multiple users to a computer\n> server\u201d by allowing users who download Unfollow Everything 2.0 to\n> automatically unfollow and re-follow friends, groups, and pages; by allowing\n> users who opt into the research study to voluntarily donate certain data for\n> research purposes; and by offering online updates to the tool.\n>\n> Second, Unfollow Everything 2.0 would enable Facebook users who download it\n> to restrict access to material they (and Zuckerman) find \u201cobjectionable.\u201d\n> Id. \u00a7 230(c)(2)(A). The purpose of the tool is to allow users who find the\n> newsfeed objectionable, or who find the specific sequencing of posts within\n> their newsfeed objectionable, to effectively turn off the feed.\n\nI\u2019ve been talking to a pretty long list of lawyers about this and I\u2019m somewhat\namazed at how this seems to have taken everyone by surprise. Normally, when\nnew lawsuits come out, I\u2019ll gut check my take on it with a few lawyers and\nthey\u2019ll all agree with each other whether I\u2019m heading in the right direction\nor the totally wrong direction. But here... the reactions were all over the\nmap, and not in any discernible pattern. More than one person I spoke to\nstarted by suggesting that this was a totally crazy legal theory, only to\nlater come back and say \u201cwell, maybe it actually makes some sense.\u201d\n\nIt could be a trojan horse that no one noticed in Section 230 that effectively\nbars websites from taking legal action against middleware providers who are\nproviding technical means for people to filter or screen content on their\nfeed. Now, it\u2019s important to note that it does not bar those companies from\nputting in place technical measures to block such tools, or just banning\naccounts or whatever. But that\u2019s very different from threatening or filing\ncivil suits.\n\nIf this theory works, it could do a lot to enable these kinds of middleware\nservices and make it significantly harder for big social media companies like\nMeta to stop them. If you believe in adversarial interoperability, that could\nbe a very big deal. Like, \u201cshift the future of the internet we all use\u201d kind\nof big.\n\nNow, there are many hurdles before we get to that point. And there are some\nconcerns that if this legal theory succeeds, it could also lead to other\nproblematic results (though I\u2019m less convinced by those).\n\nLet\u2019s start with the legal concerns.\n\nFirst, as noted, this is a very novel and untested legal theory. Upon reading\nthe case initially, my first reaction was that it felt like one of those\nslightly wacky academic law journal articles you see law professors write\nsometimes, with some far-out theory they have that no one\u2019s ever really\nthought about. This one is in the form of a lawsuit, so at some point we\u2019ll\nfind out how the theory works.\n\nBut that alone might make a judge unwilling to go down this path.\n\nThen there are some more practical concerns. Is there even standing here?\n\u0304\\\\_(\u30c4)_/ \u0304 Zuckerman hasn\u2019t released his tool. Meta hasn\u2019t threatened him. He\nmakes a credible claim that given Meta\u2019s past actions, they\u2019re likely to react\nunfavorably, but is that enough to get standing?\n\nThen there\u2019s the question of whether or not you can even make use of 230 in an\naffirmative way like this. 230 is used as a defense to get cases thrown out,\nnot proactively for declaratory judgment.\n\nAlso, this is not my area of expertise by any stretch of the imagination, but\nI remember hearing in the past that outside of IP law, courts (and especially\ncourts in the 9th Circuit) absolutely disfavor lawsuits for declaratory\njudgment (i.e., a lawsuit before there\u2019s any controversy, where you ask the\ncourt \u201chey, can you just check and make sure I\u2019m on the right side of the law\nhere...\u201d). So I could totally see the judge saying \u201csorry, this is not a\nproper use of our time\u201d and tossing it. In fact, that might be the most likely\nresult.\n\nThen there\u2019s this kinda funny but possibly consequential issue: there\u2019s a typo\nin Section 230 that almost everyone has ignored for years. Because it\u2019s never\nreally mattered. Except it matters in this case. Jeff Kosseff, the author of\nthe book on Section 230, always likes to highlight that in (c)(2)(B), it says\nthat the immunity is for using \u201cthe technical means to restrict access to\nmaterial described in paragraph (1).\u201d\n\nBut they don\u2019t mean \u201cparagraph (1).\u201d They mean \u201cparagraph (A).\u201d Paragraph (1)\nis the \u201c26 words\u201d and does not describe any material, so it would make no\nsense to say \u201cmaterial described in paragraph (1).\u201d It almost certainly means\n\u201cparagraph (A),\u201d which is the \u201cgood faith to restrict access to or\navailability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene,\nlewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise\nobjectionable\u201d section. That\u2019s the one that describes material.\n\nI know that, at times, Jeff has joked when people ask him how 230 should be\nreformed he suggests they fix the typo. But Congress has never listened.\n\nAnd now it might matter?\n\nThe lawsuit basically pretends that the typo isn\u2019t there. Its language inserts\nthe language from \u201cparagraph (A)\u201d where the law says \u201cparagraph (1).\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know how that gets handled. Perhaps it gets ignored like every time\nJeff points out the typo? Perhaps it becomes consequential? Who knows!\n\nThere are a few other oddities here, but this article is getting long enough\nand has mostly covered the important points. However, I will conclude on one\nother point that one of the people I spoke to raised. As discussed above, Meta\nhas spent most of the past dozen or so years going legally ballistic about\nanyone trying to scrape or data mine its properties in anyway.\n\nYet, earlier this year, it somewhat surprisingly bailed out on a case where it\nhad sued Bright Data for scraping/data mining. Lawyer Kieran McCarthy (who\nfollows data scraping lawsuits like no one else) speculated that Meta\u2019s\nsurprising about-face may be because it suddenly realized that for all of its\nAI efforts, it\u2019s been scraping everyone else. And maybe someone high up at\nMeta suddenly realized how it was going to look in court when it got sued for\nall the AI training scraping, if the plaintiffs point out that at the very\nsame time it was suing others for scraping its properties.\n\n> For me, I suspect the decision not to appeal might be more about a shift in\n> philosophy by Meta and perhaps some of the other big platforms than it is\n> about their confidence in their ability to win this case. Today, perhaps\n> more important to Meta than keeping others off their public data is having\n> access to everyone else\u2019s public data.

My hunch is\n> that they know that any success in anti-scraping cases can be thrown back at\n> them in their own attempts to build AI training databases and LLMs. And they\n> care more about the latter than the former.\n\nI\u2019ve separately spoken to a few experts who were worried about the\nconsequences if Zuckerman succeeded here. They were worried that it might\nsimultaneously immunize potential bad actors. Specifically, you could see a\nkind of Cambridge Analytica or Clearview AI situation, where companies trying\nto get access to data for malign purposes convince people to install their\nmiddleware app. This could lead to a massive expropriation of data, and\npossibly some very sketchy services as a result.\n\nBut I\u2019m less worried about that, mainly because it\u2019s the sketchy eventuality\nof how that data is being used that would still (hopefully?) violate certain\nlaws, not the access to the data itself. Still, there are at least some\nquestions being raised about how this type of more proactive immunity might\nresult in immunizing bad actors that is at least worth thinking about.\n\nEither way, this is going to be a case worth following.\n\nFiled Under: adversarial interoperability, competition, copyright, dmca 1201,\nethan zuckerman, liability, section 230, unfollow everyone Companies: meta\n\n14 CommentsLeave a Comment\n\nIf you liked this post, you may also be interested in...\n\n  * Section 230, Which Donald Trump Wants Repealed, Protects Donald Trump For Retweeting\n  * ESA Once Again Comes Out Against Video Game Preservation Efforts\n  * Net Neutrality Is Back!

Requiring consumers to pay for the content\nthey consume is fair. It\u2019s also not the way the web was intended to work. A\ncompromise: limited liability in exchange for forgoing advertising revenue.\nCurrently, under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, platforms\naren\u2019t liable for the content on their platform. Amending section 230 to\nprovide that a platform is not liable for content on its platform if the\nplatform does not seek, accept, place or facilitate the placement of\nadvertising would go a long way towards re-establishing the web as it used to\nbe. Revenue obtained from subscriptions would still be covered by the limited\nliability restriction. With this approach, the business reasons for harvesting\nuser data \u2014 advertising \u2014 collapses. If a web business wants to keep\nadvertising revenue, then it would have to accept liability for the content on\nits website. This approach also has the added effect of supporting local\njournalism by allowing local journalism to re-capture the local advertising\ndollars lost to web businesses. Further, this approach doesn\u2019t involve\ncensorship since publishers are free to publish whatever they choose \u2014 but it\nmeans that the general consumer public isn\u2019t paying for the content unless\nthey choose to do so directly with their subscription dollars.

A Declaratory Judgment is where the controversy does exist, but\nthe defendant files the suit first to get the court to say it\u2019s not liable.\nThe present case is on the line between the two \u2014 if there\u2019s no dispute yet,\nthen it\u2019s an advisory opinion and no good; if there is a dispute, than they\nhave standing to bring a DJ. That will be one of the first things the court\nsort out.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nAnonymous Coward says:\n\nMay 2, 2024 at 11:48 pm\n\n# Re: You've confused declaratory judgment with advisory opinion\n\nSo, suppose the case does get tossed, and then Zuckerman releases his tool,\nand gets sued. I guess we now know how he plans to defend himself against such\na suit.\n\nHe has a very novel interpretation right now, but once it gets tossed and he\nbrings it up a second time, it won\u2019t be nearly as novel anymore.

They\u2019ve already\ndemonstrated quite clearly they\u2019ll throw textualism out the window, and\nthey\u2019re already pretty hostile to 230 in general.\n\nReply\n\nMake this comment the first word Make this comment the last word\n\nThis comment is new since your last visit.\n\nClickBox Agency (profile) says:\n\nMay 2, 2024 at 11:34 pm\n\n# Trojan Horse Hidden\n\nClickbox Creative Digital Marketing Agency is a leading force in Coimbatore,\noffering its expertise worldwide.

His decision to back up the guy who compared Brian to Hitler kinda seems to undermine that a bit.\n  * mildconcern: \"Following that were screenshots of tweets (or whatever the fuck)\".

BTW, I noticed that on Windows 10, whenever I write \"Streisand\", the autocomplete suggestion is \"Streisand Effect\". That is either due to how much I use it or how much it is used, but I won't dig deeper.\n  * mildconcern: partly too it seems \"what elite college kids are doing\" seems to be an automatic way of pissing off the folks who consume right wing culture war media\n  * BentFranklin: Saw a comment flagged down today and can't figure out why.

It appears it was created to mock another troll account, by posting with a different middle initial, but most people don't notice it and assume this is the same troll account, and therefore whatever point it's trying to make is lost\n  * BentFranklin: And the second comment by them in that thread is now flagged. Guess you're right. I usually don't even log in to comment anymore unless I want to give someone First Word.\n  * John Roddy: An inside joke mocking an inside joke that nobody else considers a joke?\n  * Mike Masnick: this reminds me that i need to get that feature fixed for me. since we moved to wordpress, the first word feature works for everyone who has it. except me.\n\nBecome an Insider!\n\nRecent Stories\n\n## Friday  \n  \n---  \n05:30| Court Supports NY State's Quest To Require $15 Broadband For Poor\nPeople, Much To Big Telecom's Horror (3)  \n  \n## Thursday  \n  \n20:06| Trader Joe's To Pay Legal Fees To Employee Union Over Its Bullshit\nTrademark Lawsuit (0)  \n15:50| Pro-Cop Coalition With No Web Presence Pitches Report Claiming Criminal\nJustice Reforms Are To Blame For Higher Crime Rates (17)  \n13:33| Wyden Presses FTC To Crack Down On Rampant Auto Industry Privacy Abuses\n(2)  \n12:05| Bipartisan Group Of Senators Introduce New Terrible \u2018Protect The Kids\nOnline\u2019 Bill (29)  \n10:49| Axon Wants Its Body Cameras To Start Writing Officers' Reports For Them\n(15)  \n10:44| Daily Deal: The Complete ChatGPT Artificial Intelligence OpenAI\nTraining Bundle (0)  \n09:23| Was There A Trojan Horse Hidden In Section 230 All Along That Could\nEnable Adversarial Interoperability?
