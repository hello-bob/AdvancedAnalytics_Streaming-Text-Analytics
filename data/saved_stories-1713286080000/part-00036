These companies\nadvertise themselves as being on the open source end of this spectrum, however\nit would be more accurate to label them as open core or even closed source due\nto how limited their open source offerings are.\n\nGenerally speaking, the open source product is a thin shell of features\ncompared to what the paid, hosted version of the product is. As you start to\ndig into documentation on how to self-host, you realize that you\u2019re going to\nbe hosting a \u201cCommunity Edition\u201d of said product. Release cycles for this\nedition are on a bi-annual basis while the hosted version is updated weekly.\nYou need to pay a subscription or insanely high licensing fee for any features\nthat aren\u2019t the core product such as authentication, user management, and\nanalytics.\n\nSometimes it feels like these products are designed to be incredibly difficult\nto self-host. I\u2019m not going to spin up and manage dozens of containers for web\nservices, databases, caches, and cron jobs just to track errors thrown in my\nwebserver \u2013 I\u2019m going to pay a company to do this for me.\n\nAll of these companies are VC-backed and have to turn a profit eventually. It\nmakes sense for them to grow the paid, hosted product and convert free users\nto paying ones. There\u2019s no money in giving away free work forever. As a user\nyou need to be aware of this and the inevitable direction these venture backed\ncompanies follow.\n\nMany of the open source-labeled companies that come to mind really do have\ngreat products \u2013 I\u2019m a paid user of many of them and am happy to continue\npaying for updates and support. I\u2019d like to see more honest advertising and\nless plastering of the term \u201copen source\u201d on every other product I see though.\nI doubt this is ever going to change.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Wayde Gilliam\n\n", "frontpage": false}
