This solved the issue of unpredictable monthly\nincomes and having to entertain algorithms that dictated visibility and\nmonetization on platforms like YouTube.\n\nBut with this upside, there was another problem.\n\nThis was (again) controlled by other subscription platforms, which are\nessentially marketplaces such as Patreon and OnlyFans. The downside? They\ngovern all your customer relationships. Although you see the subscribers, you\ndon't own them. You don't have their emails or phone numbers, so if they\nchurn, you can never reach them again.\n\nOn top of that, these platforms slap their own branding on your content. So\nwith all your hard work going into content creation, it's actually their brand\nthat grows.\n\nAnd the worst part? they get to take a significant cut from the creator's\nincome! Seriously?!\n\nWe decided it was time to give video creators full ownership of their fans and\nbranding while enabling them to offer memberships directly. Also, have fewer\ndeductions on their hard-earned money!\n\nHow? Prime Stream. We let you host your own video subscription site, with your\nown branded domain. All your subscriber data stays with you so you can build\nstronger relationships with your die-hard fans.\n\nWe are pioneering the era of exclusive video content creation.\n\nStay tuned.\n\nMilli Sen Founder, Prime Stream https://twitter.com/millisenpara\n\nJoin Today\n\n\u00a9 2035 by PrimeStream.\n\nbottom of page\n\n", "frontpage": false}
