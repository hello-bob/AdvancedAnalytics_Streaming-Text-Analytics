The adaptation seems to have\nbeen made to provide the USVs with protection against the Russian helicopters\nand fixed-wing aircraft that are increasingly being used to counter them,\nalthough many questions remain about how these newly added weapons are\nintended to work and just how practical the arrangement is.\n\nVideos released by the Russian Ministry of Defense show what is said to be a\nUkrainian USV armed with an infrared-guided R-73 (AA-11 Archer) short-range\nair-to-air missile coming under attack from a Russian Navy Ka-29 Helix-B\nassault helicopter. The USV performs some hard maneuvers to try and escape the\nKa-29 but is eventually destroyed, apparently by gunfire.\n\nA video taken from the Ka-29 reveals a single R-73 on one of two angled rails\nmounted on the rear of the USV, suggesting that the other weapon has already\nbeen fired. The Russian account claims that the other missile was launched in\nan unsuccessful attempt to bring down a Russian Mi-8 Hip helicopter. The fact\nthis engagement played out in daylight suggests that the drone boat may have\ndeliberately been used as \u2018bait\u2019 for these helicopters.\n\nThis is the first evidence we have of drone boats armed with R-73 missiles,\nbut there are also reports that older R-60 (AA-8 Aphid) air-to-air missiles,\nalso with infrared guidance, have been adapted as USV armament. On Telegram,\nthe pro-Kremlin Fighterbomber military channel claims that the air-to-air\nmissiles don\u2019t require any radar or separate targeting systems to be used in\nthis way. Simply, their seeker heads are used to acquire an aerial target,\nwith the signal to fire presumably being provided via the existing command\nlink that controls the USV.\n\nIn a post today, the same source claims that USV-launched air-to-air missiles\nhave not yet been employed in combat, but that they pose a risk to Russian\nhelicopters in particular, which it says are the most effective counter to the\nUkrainian USVs.\n\nThe imagery and reports of this new surface-to-air armament on Ukrainian drone\nboats emerged on the same day that Ukraine reported using Magura V5 USVs to\nconduct a successful attack on a Russian naval target.\n\nThe Ukrainian Ministry of Defense\u2019s Main Directorate of Intelligence (GUR)\nannounced that a V5 of the Ukrainian Group 13 unit destroyed \u201can enemy\nspeedboat\u201d today. The GUR published a video of the apparent attack, which took\nplace overnight in Uzka Bay in Russian-occupied Crimea.\n\nA GUR official said the Russian vessel was a Project 12150 Mangust, as used by\nthe Russian Border Service, with a reported price tag of more than $1.3\nmillion. Other accounts suggest the vessel may have been a Swedish-designed\nIC16MII assault boat.\n\n\u201cAs the fear of Ukrainian attacks forces the occupiers to hide the large ships\nof the Black Sea Fleet away from the peninsula, combat work continues against\nthe high-speed maneuverable warships of the Russians, which are illegally in\nthe Ukrainian territorial waters of Crimea,\u201d the GUR said.\n\nThe GUR also pointed to the continuing success of the Magura V5 drone boat,\nwhich it says was responsible for the destruction of the Russian Navy ships\nCesar Kunikov, Ivanovets, Sergei Kotov, Akula, and Serna, as well as\ninflicting damage on the Ivan Khurs. While some of the claims for vessels\nbeing outright destroyed may be questionable, there is an abundance of\nevidence that Ukrainian USV operations are playing a major role as part of a\nbroader asymmetric campaign to hit targets inside Russian-occupied areas and\nRussia itself.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if any of the drone boats involved in the Uzka Bay attack \u2014\nRussian sources claim that five USVs were used \u2014 were fitted with defensive\nmissiles. However, it\u2019s noteworthy that the GUR video appears to show debris\nfalling into the water, suggesting that something may have detonated in the\nair. At the 0:48 point in the video, a long pale-colored object is seen\nfalling into the water, apparently the approximate shape and size of one of\nthese air-to-air missiles.\n\nAt this stage, we don\u2019t know if there is any direct connection between the\nappearance of a USV outfitted with adapted air-to-air missiles and the\nengagement overnight in Uzka Bay, but it\u2019s worth considering.\n\nTWZ has approached the GUR but they declined to comment at this stage.\n\nIn general, however, there are several precedents for air-to-air missiles\nbeing adapted for surface launch, both as anti-aircraft weapons and even for\nthe bombardment of ground targets. The Yemen-based Houthi militants, in\nparticular, have adapted R-73s for surface launch against aircraft targets,\nand used them in combat, as you can read about here.\n\nWhile there are accounts of drone boats in the past having been fitted with\nman-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) this would appear to be the first\ntime that a USV has been equipped with an air-to-air missile in this way.\n\nA schematic diagram of the R-73 missile. Public Domain\n\nPotentially, the development is significant.\n\nAs a high-off-boresight (HOBS) weapon, the seeker on the R-73 can articulate\nin any direction much farther than a traditional heat-seeking air-to-air\nmissile with a fixed seeker that stares directly forward. Aided by a helmet-\nmounted sight, the Archer can be launched in air-to-air engagements against\ntargets with off-boresight angles of +/-75 degrees. This gives the R-73 the\npotential to be a particularly potent, albeit improvised threat for locking\nonto and engaging dynamic targets with minimal assisting sensors when used in\na surface-launched form. Clearly, Ukraine has also developed a way of using\nthis HOBS capability remotely to ensure this weapon is effective at all. The\nHouthis used a commercial FLIR as part of their ground-launched Archer\nadaptation.\n\nUkraine appears to have extensive stocks of R-73s (and likely also the older\nR-60s) and the hot engines of a nearby helicopter should make a good target\nfor their seeker heads. Even if the probability of kill is not especially\nhigh, and the overall range of the missile markedly reduced, the risk posed to\nrotorcraft is such that it may force them to operate further from the drone\nboats. This would render their primary machine gun armament ineffective, as\nwell as the rockets and anti-tank guided missiles that they could otherwise be\narmed with.\n\nAs it stands, the effectiveness of the newly added anti-aircraft missiles on\nUSVs remains to be seen although it reflects the willingness of Ukraine to\nexperiment with new and unorthodox military solutions \u2014 and to introduce them\nrapidly when required.\n\nHowever, it is a very interesting development that points to the rapid pace of\nchange in the Black Sea drone war, as well as the continuing game of cat and\nmouse between Ukraine\u2019s USVs and the Russian assets assigned to defend against\nthem.\n\nContact the author: thomas@thewarzone.com\n\nAir Force MunitionsAir-To-AirAround The GlobeEuropeNaval\nMunitionsNaviesRussiaUkraineUkrainian NavyUnmanned Surface Vessels (USVs)\n\nSign Up For Our Newsletters\n\nSign Up\n\n  * About TWZ\n  * The Team\n  * Contact Us\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Sitemap\n\n\u00a9 2024 Recurrent Ventures.
