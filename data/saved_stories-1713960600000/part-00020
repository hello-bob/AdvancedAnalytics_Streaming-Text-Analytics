I\u2019m Antonio Sarcevic, part of the app team over here at\nDatawrapper, and today I\u2019ll be taking a look at the topic that first got me\ninto politics: drug prohibition.\n\nRecently, Germany has decriminalized the possession of small quantities of\ncannabis for personal consumption, as changing the policies around cannabis\nhas been a goal of the governing coalition. For some, this is a first step\ntoward a more humane drug politics, while for others, the same thing looks\nlike the start of a slippery slope, dooming our society as we know it.\n\nGermany isn\u2019t the first country to change its mind about cannabis, as other\ncountries and states have already decriminalized or even legalized the\nsubstance in the past decade. So why are we shifting our stance on cannabis\nand other substances? Aren\u2019t these laws here to protect us from the harms of\nillicit drug use?\n\nThis visualization makes one fact crystal clear: drugs aren\u2019t split into legal\nand illegal by the harm they cause. This figure comes from a 2020 study based\non the assessments of German physicians specializing in addiction, but\nvariations have been done over and over at different times and in different\ncountries, with only slightly varying results.\n\nThere are also researchers that question the value of such a one dimensional\ndefinition of harm. So let\u2019s take a look at a very straightforward measure,\nthe deaths caused by legal and illegal substances:\n\nSo, how did we get here? How come tobacco and alcohol are still regulated so\nliberally, while we punish people for simply possessing illicit drugs? The\nselection of which drugs we prohibit isn't scientific, but it isn't arbitrary\neither. In the U.S., for example, the first anti-drug law was an 1875 ban on\n\u201copium dens,\u201d which targeted Chinese immigrant communities. Further\nprohibitionist laws were often tied to specific minority groups, like banning\ncocaine in 1914, which was associated with southern Black people, or cannabis\nin 1937, which targeted Mexican immigrants. In fact, the term \"marijuana\" was\npopularized by Harry J. Anslinger, then first commissioner of the Federal\nBureau of Narcotics, to make the plant sound more exotic and dangerous. These\nlaws have been brought all over the world through international contracts and\nconventions like the International Opium Convention.\n\nBut do these laws even work to prevent drug use? Well... in 2011, the newly-\nformed Global Commission on Drug Policy published a report claiming that\n\u201c[t]he global war on drugs has failed, with devastating consequences for\nindividuals and societies around the world,\u201d citing rising global consumption\nof illicit drugs like opiates, cocaine, and cannabis. These laws criminalize,\nstigmatize, and discriminate against users of illicit drugs, even when they do\nno harm to others. Research also suggests that drug prohibition generates\nviolence. At the same time, the black market has taken the opportunity to\nsupply drugs to those who want them \u2014 without any health regulations or\nconsumer rights, of course.\n\nIt's important to realize that not all drug use is equal to addiction, or\ninevitably leads to addiction. \u201cOnly a minority [of drug users] become problem\ndrug users,\u201d finds a recent literature review on the topic. The world isn\u2019t\nblack and white, and drugs aren\u2019t either. We are all drug users, be it your\nmorning coffee or prescription medicine.\n\nWe need to stop discriminating against people who use criminalized substances,\nas punishing every illicit drug user harms society more than the drugs\nthemselves ever could, and disproportionately affects already-marginalized\npeople. Punishment also doesn't help those who actually need support with\ntheir problematic drug use. Instead, we need to accept reality that people\nwill continue to use drugs, even when faced with capital punishment.\n\nOn the other hand, decriminalization does not lead to a significant increase\nin drug use, as seen in Portugal, where use and possession of all drugs has\nbeen decriminalized since 2001. So if current laws aren\u2019t based in science,\nand don\u2019t prevent drug use, what kind of drug policy should we have instead?\n\nWe need to educate people about drugs, their risks, and how to be safer when\nthey choose to consume. We need to replace persecution of all illicit drug\nusers with more low-barrier treatment options for those who need them. At the\nsame time, we also need to question our current beliefs and laws around legal\nsubstances like alcohol and tobacco. These drugs aren\u2019t risk-free just because\nyou can buy them in a store. But because of the false division into legal and\nillegal, they often aren\u2019t thought of as \u201creal drugs\u201d with real dangers. We\nneed a drug policy that aims to actually reduce harms, instead of increasing\nharms while carving into the human rights of users.\n\nI encourage everyone to question their beliefs around drugs and how our\nsociety deals with people who use them. A good place to start is reading this\npiece on 75 fallacies that underpin current drug policy by social worker and\ndrug policy expert Julian Buchanan. Thankfully, we're seeing small steps in\nthe right direction, like the recent decriminalization of cannabis in Germany,\nand organizations like the Drug Policy Alliance, Transform Drug Policy\nFoundation, Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, Schildower Kreis and many\nmore are working toward more humane drug policies everywhere.\n\nThanks for reading this half-Weekly Chart half-rant post \ud83d\ude05 If you have any\ncomments or questions, feel free to leave them below!
