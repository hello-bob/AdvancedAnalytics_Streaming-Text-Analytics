We live in\nwhat I call a culture of envy.\n\nMatt Welsh, a software engineer who previously was a Harvard professor, wrote\nabout the Fame trap last week, telling us that the pursuit of academic fame\nmade him unhappy:\n\n> Once I had kids, I really started to appreciate the toll it was having on my\n> family (...), and I started to realize that maybe I had my priorities all\n> wrong. (...) I think chasing academic fame is not the best reason to go down\n> that path. I wish I had known that when I was finishing my PhD.\n\nThe scholarly book of the year is probably Piketty\u2019s Capital in the Twenty-\nFirst Century. This book has served as a rallying point for all of those who\nworry that managers are enriching themselves without bounds.\n\nWhat is at stake in all cases, is that people insist on playing what Carse\ncalls finite games. They may not realize that it is what they are doing...\nthey may not even realize that they agreed to such games, but that is what\nthey do nevertheless.\n\nIn finite games, there are winners and losers. The acquisition of a high\nsocial status... only makes sense as games if there are winners or losers.\n\nIt is important to realize that this has nothing to do with absolute wealth\nand everything to do with envy. Let us put it clearly:\n\n  * If you drive a luxury car, it is almost certainly to create the envy of those (like me) who drive a cheap Honda. Or to lessen the envy you feel with respect to those who drive luxury cars. Thorstein Veblen called it conspicuous consumption.\n  * If you achieve fame, people will be envious of it. Your fame only makes sense if you have more of it than others, and if it is desired by others.\n\nIn a wealthy society, envy can quickly become the driving force. It is not\nabout meeting your needs, but about achieving an envious position. In effect,\nyou seek to be better off than most... in whatever finite game you are\nplaying.\n\nWhat is the alternative? Carse examines at length what he calls infinite\ngames. You know that you are playing an infinite game when....\n\n  * You are never playing against other people, against other teams. You are playing with others.\n  * Rules can be reinvented...\n  * The game may never end...\n  * Players have no compelling reason to be envious of each other...\n\nYou cannot force others to play your finite games. Matt Welsh decided to drop\nout of the academic fame game. He had the tenured professorship at Harvard but\nhe decided to play other games, elsewhere.\n\nThe same is true of money... you can buy a BMW and a big house to create envy\nin others... but these people can decide at any time that they are not players\nin this game. They may choose not to pursue the acquisition of luxury goods,\nand not to be envious of you.\n\nI think that it is time that we pay less attention to people who take finite\ngames seriously. I believe that it is the irony of a book like Piketty\u2019s. You\nare most likely to be upset by financial inequalities if you take finite games\nseriously. So who is Piketty? He earned his PhD from the London School of\nEconomics when he was 22. He went on to become a professor at MIT, and he\nended up creating and leading his own prestigious school in Paris. If anyone\ntakes finite games seriously, it is Piketty. The intellectual leader of Occupy\nWall-Street, David Graeber, is similarly a competitive over-achiever... a\nprofessor at Yale University and now a professor at the London School of\nEconomics. These are people who would not have taken \u201cregular jobs\u201d. They\nsought the highest for of prestige.\n\nI believe that if there is one thing humanity needs to do to get through the\nnext few centuries, is to reject envy and stop taking finite games seriously.\nIt also happens to be a recipe to be happier on an individual basis. Avoid\nconspicuous consumption. Be ok with just being a dad to your kids, as opposed\nto a famous star.\n\nFolks may think that infinite games are indicates a lack of ambition. But\ninfinite games provide room for infinite ambition. Finite games are severely\nlimiting in comparison. I believe that the truly ambitious create their own\ngames.\n\nNext time you feel envious, please pay attention. And choose your games\ncarefully.\n\nDaniel Lemire, \"A culture of envy,\" in Daniel Lemire's blog, August 11, 2014.\n\n## Published by\n\n### Daniel Lemire\n\nA computer science professor at the University of Quebec (TELUQ).

Benoit Hamelin says:\n\nAugust 11, 2014 at 11:59 am\n\nSome inequalities must obviously be taken seriously, as it\u2019s true that some\npeople must work two jobs to eat half-decently and live under a roof in\nwestern cities \u2014 to mention just that. However, I gather that your post points\nto inequalities that arise from a chosen perspective that actually-empowered\nfolks may change, and I agree wholeheartedly.\n\nIt\u2019s super hard to shed and regrow culture, though, even merely one\u2019s own! The\nlittle successes and hacks and tweaks towards self-reliance and simplicity\nbring great reward, but falling back into the restless, half-conscious cycle\nof self-aggrandizing ambition and consumption is pernicious and all too easy.\n\nReply\n\n  5. Daniel Lemire says:\n\nAugust 11, 2014 at 12:53 pm\n\n@Benoit\n\nPoverty is not the same thing as inequality. There was very little economic\ninequality under the Soviet rule... but lots of people were poor in the sense\nthat they ran out of food or had bad apartments.\n\nThe people who went to Wall Street to protest were not poor. They had laptops,\nmobile phones with Internet access, plenty of food, even a library... Compared\nto most human beings having set foot on Earth, they were amazingly wealthy.\n\nSure, there are poor people and it is a serious matter... but we actually\nspend very little time worrying about it... we tend to think about our own\nlittle universe and about how it is unfair that we are not winners according\nto some games we do not recall choosing to play... while we own fantastic\ncomputers, we have travel to foreign countries and so on.\n\nThere is so much we can do if we just choose the right games.\n\nReply\n\n  6. Mark says:\n\nAugust 11, 2014 at 1:15 pm\n\nGood post, and something many of us have thought about I\u2019m sure, but here\u2019s\nwhat I wonder about:\n\nWhat does scientific, academic, medical, etc., advancement look like without\ncompetition?\n\nDon\u2019t the results of competition (to all competitors, even the \u201closers\u201d)\noutdistance the results of cooperation, very often?\n\nI think envy itself is not bad, but what you choose to envy is important.\nSomeone has more money than I do? Don\u2019t care. Fame? Really, really don\u2019t care.\n\nBut someone knows more than I do (in a field I care about)? Yes, I want what\nthat person has, very much.\n\nReply\n\n  7. Daniel Lemire says:\n\nAugust 11, 2014 at 2:04 pm\n\n@Mark\n\nCompetition is not the same as emulation.\n\nFor all the talk of science and engineering being a vast competition... I\nthink you find competition in specific organized instances, many of them\nexternal to the primary activities.\n\nIf you run a company and turn your employees into competitors, I think you\nrisk ruining your company.\n\nReply\n\n  8. Daniel Lemire says:\n\nAugust 11, 2014 at 2:05 pm\n\n@Kristjan\n\nIt is related, at least in my mind.\n\nReply\n\n  9. Leonid Boytsov says:\n\nAugust 11, 2014 at 2:16 pm\n\nIt is absolutely untrue that Soviet people were poor. Many people in, e.g., US\nare struggling much more than an average Soviet person despite having\nsmartphones and cars.\n\nFor instance, paying off your student loans all your life is not fun.\n\nGadgets don\u2019t make you rich. Gadgets are cheap. Even cars don\u2019t make you rich.\nIn fact, most people can live much happier lives without a daily commute in a\nsmaller apartment (even Soviet-style).\n\nIt is also quite outrageous to say that there are few poor people in the\nWestern countries. And these numbers are growing. Inequality in North America\nis about access to education and decent jobs.\n\nPerhaps, before getting rid of envy we should give people jobs instead of\nlocking them up in millions in prisons.\n\nReply\n\n  10. @sebpaquet says:\n\nAugust 11, 2014 at 2:31 pm\n\nhttp://www.salon.com/2013/12/10/ayn_rand_loving_ceo_destroys_his_empire_partner/\n\nLampert took the myth that humans perform best when acting selfishly as\ngospel, pitting Sears company managers against each other in a kind of Lord of\nthe Flies death match. This, he believed, would cause them to act rationally\nand boost performance.\n\nReply\n\n  11. Daniel Lemire says:\n\nAugust 11, 2014 at 3:48 pm\n\n@Leonid\n\n1) Much of the poverty in the US is caused by wars... such as the war on\ndrugs. Wars are very much a feature of finite-game approaches.\n\n2) \u201cInequality in North America is about access to education and decent jobs.\u201d\n\nI think you mean high status jobs like engineering, management and so on.\n\nIt is really not hard to become an IT guy or a trucker in North America.\n\n3) Under Soviet rule, Germans were doing so well that they had to put a wall\nto prevent people from leaving. Despite having no population growth, East\nGermany had nearly 1 million families waiting for an apartment... and many who\ndid have apartments did not have a bathroom. Food was often of poor quality.\nPollution was often excessive. People were willing to risk their lifes to get\nout.\n\nReply\n\n  12. Daniel Lemire says:\n\nAugust 11, 2014 at 3:56 pm\n\n@sebpaquet\n\nRight, some competition can be fun, and maybe stimulating, but it is a myth\nthat we need widespread competition to make things work.\n\nI do not think that it is the feature of capitalism that makes it work. You\ncan certainly succeed in business without having to worry that people are out\nto get you...\n\nAnd frankly, people are not out to get you when you are in a market. There is\nmore cooperation than competition. You do not really want others to lose their\nshop.\n\nReply\n\n  13. Leonid Boytsov says:\n\nAugust 11, 2014 at 4:02 pm\n\nI am glad @Daniel that you mentioned trucking. This is such a nice job:\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/04/28/trucking-used-to-\nbe-a-ticket-to-the-middle-class-now-its-just-another-low-wage-job/ Besides,\nhow soon will self-driving car eliminate this one? It is only a matter of,\nperhaps, a couple of decades.\n\nRegarding an ease of becoming an IT guy, you\u2019re sure joking. Let\u2019s begin with\nthe fact that there are only a handful of IT jobs. And, then, not everyone can\nbe an IT guy.\n\nPeople, who are not IT often have to work looooong hours to keep their jobs.\nEven well-educated people. Not everybody has stability like a tenured\nprofessor. Jobs are diminishing and this is only getting worse.\n\nBut, of course, our main problem is envy. Let\u2019s solve this one.\n\nReply\n\n  14. Leonid Boytsov says:\n\nAugust 11, 2014 at 4:05 pm\n\nAnd IT jobs are such a joke as well. Nobody knows why exactly people can still\nhave them instead of the guy in India and China. This may not be forever,\neither.\n\nReply\n\n  15. Simon says:\n\nAugust 11, 2014 at 5:03 pm\n\nSenior bay area engineer tell everybody else not to play finite games,\nirony==lost\n\nReply\n\n  16.

Leonid Boytsov says:\n\nAugust 11, 2014 at 5:16 pm\n\n@Daniel, the point is that their salaries are going down and will disappear\nsoon. As well as other blue collar jobs.\n\nAt the same time, accumulation of wealth in hands of few gives them way too\nmuch power. In particular, we have wars because of this.\n\nIt is not a bit healthy envy and competitiveness that is harmful. It is the\n*SUPERGREED* that is disastrous. And too much inequality is caused by the\nsupegreed as well. You are pretty much attacking the wrong target.\n\nReply\n\n  18.

Peter Hancock says:\n\nAugust 12, 2014 at 5:06 am\n\nThis post really piqued my interest, and I thought I\u2019d say why, even thought\nit\u2019s a bit tangential.\n\nQuite some time ago I worked on an abstract (highly idealised) model for\nspecifying interfaces between a server and its client(s), according to which\ntheir interaction amounted to playing an infinite game.\n\nThe server wins, as it were \u201cat the end of time\u201d, if it never gets into a\nsituation in which the client can make a request to which it has no response.\nShould that happen, the server loses, and the client wins. The client is not\nreally concerned to win. The game is collaborative: ideally, there are no\nwinners and no losers \u2014 until \u201cthe end of time\u201d, which is no time at all. The\nbasic idea is of course not original to me, and anyone who knows a little\nabout temporal logic will recognise it as little more than a banality.\n\nSometimes my friends, or people I met socially would ask me what sort of thing\nit was I was working on, and I\u2019d say something like the above: a notion of\ngame in which no-one ever loses, unless something goes badly wrong. It\nastonished me that quite often I ran into outright hostility to the very\nnotion of such a game, as if I were some kind of befuddled hippy.\n\nReply\n\n  22. Paul says:\n\nAugust 12, 2014 at 10:22 am\n\nIt\u2019s not only that a minimum wage worker has envy of a larger apartment and a\ncar. I agree: if they have a roof and food and family and perhaps access to a\nlibrary, they\u2019ve got plenty for a fulfilling life.\n\nWhat they lack is any guarantee the food and roof will still be there\ntomorrow. That a minimum wage job feeds you today is no guarantee that a bad\ngrowing season won\u2019t change that. Or that a health condition won\u2019t strike that\nyou won\u2019t be able to afford. That\u2019s a stressful existence. I try to avoid the\nbottom rungs of society not because I want people to envy me, but because when\ntimes get rough, they suffer most.\n\nIf a PhD is driven to be recognized as top of his field, if the unit of envy\nis a citation, to me that\u2019s a very positive thing. The professor pushes\nforward human knowledge, and gets paid in as cheap a currency as respect.\n\nIt\u2019s when unit of the game is money that things get problematic, because\nthat\u2019s also the unit of basic survival, of political power, of economic\ndisruption. When the unit is conspicuous consumption, we waste for no real\nbenefit.\n\nSo I really don\u2019t see the envy game being disbanded, but I\u2019d love to see it\nmoved away from money to intangibles: titles and symbols and recognition to\nkeep the game churning without dictating so completely economic direction.\n\nReply\n\n  23. Daniel Lemire says:\n\nAugust 12, 2014 at 10:42 am\n\n@Paul\n\nIn finite games, you win a title. This title gives you power. It does not\nmatter if the title is money or a medal. However, it matters that this prize\nmakes you powerful. It is the whole point.\n\nI\u2019d love to see it moved away from money to intangibles: titles and symbols\n(...)\n\nBut that is precisely what money is. It is a title. It grants you power.\n\nIt is not like money is a tangible good, like food or lodging. I have $132 in\nmy bank account. I can prove it to you by printing out a piece of paper from\nan ATM. But it is not really tangible... it is symbol of my relative power.\nBut if you decide that you are not interested in money, then it becomes\nmeaningless. I can only hold power over you with my money because you choose\nto recognize it. Money is a convention.\n\nOf course, we can generate more money. A lot more. And it would cost us\nnothing. Except that it would reduce the value of money... But that is like\nsaying that if we gave 3 gold medals instead of just one... we would devalue\ngold medals.\n\nIt is all about symbols. We have to keep them scarce to keep their value.\n\nBill Gates has lots of money. This grants him power. But how exactly? Because\nwe choose to recognize it. If tomorrow, we all agreed that money had no power,\nthat we did not accept it... if we simply decided to stop recognizing all\ntitles... Bill Gates would be just as powerless as you and me.\n\nThese things do happen. They happened during the revolution in Russia. The\nrich lost all their power.\n\nBill Gates holds titles, including money. We choose to recognize this (as part\nof a game) as giving him power.\n\nIn this sense, no amount of money could ever ensure your future. You need for\npeople to keep on recognizing your titles. That is what society does. It\nforces us to recognize past winners.\n\nReply\n\n  24. Dominic Amann says:\n\nAugust 12, 2014 at 3:52 pm\n\nMorality is always arguable. Legality is more fixed (but still arguable).\nEffectiveness can be determined in practice or by economic theory.\n\nNon compete clauses may lower the salary of workers in the Country, and make\nthe entire country less attractive as a place for those specialists.\nCanadians, Australians, Brits may all be naturals for emmigrating of they see\nenough benefit, but it would have to be significant moneywise. If salaries\nhave been depressed, then the pool of potential experts can be diminished.\n\nReply\n\n  25. Paul says:\n\nAugust 12, 2014 at 11:06 am\n\nIt\u2019s not the fact that cash is intangible, it\u2019s the fact that it\u2019s\ntransferable.\n\nPeter Higgs has a Nobel medal and a particle named after him. This grants him\nparticular powers: people will recognize his name, will be more eager to work\nwith him, will give him seats of honor and speaking opportunities and all the\nrest. He gets a louder voice in dictating future research directions.\n\nPeople will not trade him mansions for the medal. Politicians will not write\nlaws at his desire in return for the Higgs Boson being renamed the John Smith\nBoson.\n\nIf tomorrow we decide that actually, Peter Higgs\u2019 work was rubbish, the power\ngoes away.\n\nThis is very different from having to seize all the assets of a disgraced CEO\nor outright abolish the dollar.\n\nThe envy game is about power, but there\u2019s huge leeway in what sorts of power.\nI think a lot of people playing it just want recognition. If people murmur\nwhen they enter a room, if they get seated quickly to the best seats in a\nrestaurant, if they go through the VIP door in a club: that\u2019s success.\n\nWith money, they\u2019re instead granted extremely broad power. Bill Gates was a\nsmart man and a successful CEO. We reward that by making him perhaps the\nsingle most influential individual in choosing the future of education in this\ncountry and the direction our charity travels. If instead he wanted to amass a\ngigantic fleet of boats, or turn swathes of farmland into wilderness reserves,\nor influence who becomes the president of the United States, that would be in\nhis purview as well. If he decides any arbitrary individual should have power,\nhe can give it to them.\n\nThere\u2019s a gigantic gap between the status quo and abolishing money, between\nthe envy game as it stands and an idealized contentment game.\n\nReply\n\n  26. Daniel Lemire says:\n\nAugust 12, 2014 at 12:10 pm\n\n@Paul\n\nI think that your real concern is that you believe that a scientific prize is\ndutifully earned whereas the salary of a CEO is not genuinely earned.\n\nSo you do not recognize the CEO as a real winner... And that is a real problem\nfor society as it leads people to question the games themselves.\n\nWith money, they\u2019re instead granted extremely broad power.\n\nYour point seems to be that fungible titles (e.g., currency, gold, credit)\ngrant broader powers than non-fungible titles in general.\n\nIf you think back about the last century or so... who are the men who used\ntheir broad power to cause the greatest harm... Please, show me your top-10\nlist. If many of them derived their power primarily from fungible titles\n(money, credit, gold) as opposed to non-fungible titles (president, prime\nminister, absolute ruler, CEO), we need to have a chat about history.\n\nReply\n\n  27. Paul says:\n\nAugust 12, 2014 at 12:38 pm\n\nNope, I absolutely recognize that CEO\u2019s are often smart, hard working and\ncontributing positively to society.\n\nI also agree that political power is usually larger than just monetary power.\nGranting political power for a job well done is definitely a step backwards\ntowards feudalism.\n\nTo be succinct, this is my point: you posit that envy drives a lot of economic\nactors, and I agree. But I think that\u2019s a good thing, that a CEO might be\nmiserable putting in 70 hour weeks, but if he makes the company more efficient\nas an outcome that\u2019s a social positive. I\u2019m fine with his vanity if it helps\nsociety.\n\nSo my concern isn\u2019t that people want power, it\u2019s that I think we\u2019re giving\nthem more power than is strictly needed to get them to be productive. I use\nresearchers as an example because they work 70 hour weeks too, not to become a\nbillionaire but for a little wealth and a lot of respect/recognition.\n\nI hypothesize that if CEO were like that: say, $200K a year, but a chance at\nthe \u201cbusiness hall of fame\u201d and your face on magazines and say, automatic\nupgrades to first class on airplanes, people would still flock to the position\nto be the envied one. So by paying them tens of millions, which grants a lot\nof power in a lot of fields, we\u2019re making a poor investment, because we could\nhave gotten that effort out of them cheaper.\n\nReply\n\n  28. Paul says:\n\nAugust 12, 2014 at 12:45 pm\n\nAlso: I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with power differentials. It\u2019s\nextremely hard to have a system without them. A Nobel prize winner gains extra\npower over hiring and research direction in his field. Ok, but he demonstrated\nexpertise in this field. Somebody has to have that power, why not him?\n\nSame with the CEO: tons of power directing the company. Ok, that\u2019s the job, he\nearned the position somehow, somebody has to do that.\n\nContrast with money/political power which are powers that can be used in\nalmost any field. Obviously there\u2019s tons of examples of Nobel Prize winners\ngoing on to promote bad research. But it\u2019s not unreasonable to think they\u2019ll\nbe at least no worse than a researcher chosen at random. The real danger is\npower misused, so to the extent that power is given for some degree of\ndemonstrated good stewardship over this flavor of power, the power granted\nisn\u2019t particularly a social cost (the way abused power is)\n\nReply\n\n  29. Daniel Lemire says:\n\nAugust 12, 2014 at 1:04 pm\n\n@Paul\n\nSince we demonize highly paid CEOs right now, by the counterpart of your\nlogic, we end up having to pay them more, no?\n\nSo we should celebrate them, instead.\n\nAs for your last comment, you did not follow up on my comment regarding who\nare the worst power abusers. I think you will find that most of them held non-\nfungible titles. People merely using money rarely end up being responsible for\nmillions of deaths. There is only so much harm Bill Gates can be held\nresponsible for.\n\nReply\n\n  30. Leonid Boytsov says:\n\nAugust 12, 2014 at 1:11 pm\n\n@Daniel, it would have been all fine, if we didn\u2019t know that the worst power\nabusers are likely not acting on their own.

Democracies are likely to\nbe different, so it is unfair to compare against.\n\nIn fact, all the political and socialistic theories are just a lot of\nhandewaving.

Granting political power for a job well done\nis definitely a step backwards towards feudalism.\u201d\n\nIt looks like your list is autocratic leaders (also the four names that came\nto my mind). I\u2019m definitely not advocating that instead of paying the elite a\nlot of cash we grant them free control over the populace. Was Mao so bad\nbecause he held the title of chairman? Or because the post of chairman granted\ncontrol over a powerful political apparatus (or perhaps more accurately that\nhe already had the political power from creating the government)?\n\nautocratic power is more dangerous than monetary power is more dangerous than\nlocalized power is more dangerous than symbolic power.\n\nSo wherever possible we should be looking to meet people\u2019s needs for feeling\npowerful as low on that list as possible.\n\nReply\n\n  34.

They are not in California however.\n\nIt was clearly illegal, in California. But is it even immoral? How could it be\nwhen it would be legal elsewhere?\n\nReply\n\n  37.

Daniel Lemire says:\n\nAugust 13, 2014 at 8:35 am\n\n@Leonid\n\nSenior executives are routinely the subject of non-compete clauses everywhere\nin the world. It is not just programmers in California. Even hairdressers\noften have to sign similar agreements.\n\nThere are implicit non-compete clauses in academia. Many of them. For example,\nwe never take away someone\u2019s grad student or post-doc, by outbidding our\ncolleague. It is simply not done.\n\nEven professors are the subject of these non-compete clauses... Most\nuniversities have policies to discourage their departments from recruiting\ntenured professors from other schools. Though it does happen, it meant to be\nexceptional... Just like Steve Jobs wanted it to be exceptional that an Apple\nengineer would become a Google engineer.\n\nI do not quite have an opinion on whether it is good or bad... but it is\nabsolutely true that non-compete clauses are widespread.\n\nI am happy for the programmers in California. Good for them if they can get\nmore money!!! But they are hardly victims here.\n\nAt a minimum, I can absolutely understand why it is bad form for Google\nrecruiters to call up Apple engineers. From Apple\u2019s point of view, it is an\naggressive manoeuvre. It is hostile. As I have written above, I do not think\ncapitalism is all about competition. Apple and Google are not out to kill each\nother. They prefer to be friendly and cooperate when possible. And it makes\nplenty of sense.\n\nReply\n\n  41. Dominic Amann says:\n\nAugust 13, 2014 at 1:46 pm\n\nIt is interesting that although universities have these cosy agreements about\npost-docs, the pay for CEOs at universities has seen no such constraint.\nUniversity president salaries are now upwards of 1/2 million and climbing,\nwith additional benefits. This is \u201cyet another\u201d system that is a victim of\nenvy.\n\nReply\n\n  42. Leonid Boytsov says:\n\nAugust 13, 2014 at 11:43 am\n\nYou should, perhaps, allow universities to compete for postdocs. It would not\nhave been such a miserable job otherwise.\n\nReply\n\n  43. Daniel Lemire says:\n\nAugust 13, 2014 at 12:12 pm\n\n@Leonid\n\nIf you somehow managed to raise the salaries of the top-postdocs, they would\nbe better off. However, since the funding sources are likely not elastic, you\nwould have fewer positions available... so some people would have nothing\ninstead of a postdoc.\n\nIt could even lead to redirection of funding from postdocs to graduate\nstudents, attracting more graduate student, and leading to many more\nunemployed PhDs.\n\nI am not saying that any of this would happen, but it is not straightforward\nthat, for example, all software engineers in California would have been better\noff without the non-compete agreements. The star players would have earned\nhigh salaries... but it is also possible that there would have been fewer\njobs... more unemployment.\n\nReply\n\n  44. Leonid Boytsov says:\n\nAugust 13, 2014 at 12:48 pm\n\nIn a crony capitalism, @Daniel, (or should I say friendly?) there is less of\neverything for simple people. Does this create a culture of envy?

Daniel Lemire says:\n\nAugust 13, 2014 at 2:05 pm\n\n@Dominic\n\nAt the University of Quebec, where I work, university presidents earn much\nless than 1/2 million. We also offer low fees, and our programs are typically\nopen to all.\n\nBut students often prefer to attend more prestigious schools. In fact, the\ngovernment has to forcefully keep tuition fees low at McGill otherwise they\ncould charge many times what they are charging now, and students would still\nflock there.\n\nPeople are attracted to prestige and high social status like moths. So it is a\nwise investment to hire the most prestigious president you can find.\n\nReply\n\n  46. Atul Mehta says:\n\nAugust 14, 2014 at 10:19 am\n\nExcellent observations. But you can\u2019t stop taking finite games seriously while\nchoosing your games however carefully you do so.\n\nCompetitive and rewarding societies fare much better overall than conformant\nones. Mark points out that advancement comes from competition, but it is\nperhaps a bit more complex \u2014 coopetition among individuals is perhaps a more\nappropriate reason for rapid advancements (ref: game theory).\n\nEnvy and jealousy are ubiquitous products of human psychology regardless of\npolitical beliefs. From the perspective of positive psychology, and while this\ncan be hard to do for most people, it is replacing *envy* with *admiration* in\nones mind that makes a difference.\n\nReply\n\n  47.

Daniel Lemire says:\n\nAugust 14, 2014 at 10:51 am\n\n@Atul\n\nEnvy is certainly a natural emotion, but I think our societies cultivate it to\na degree that is unhealthy. It is destructive.\n\nCompetitive and rewarding societies fare much better overall than conformant\nones.\n\nAgain, I do not believe that competition is the key feature that makes\ncapitalism work.\n\nI do not believe that competition is what makes science work. In fact,\nwhenever you read of stories about intense competition in science, it is often\nquite destructive. Newton wasted 14 years, by his own account.\n\nSure, a little bit of competition can be fun and productive. But if\ncompetition is your default model, then things are probably not going well.\n\nSure, athletes will compete fiercely... for an hour or so... but then, they\nwill gladly take a beer together and exchange tips. Those who cannot do\nanything but compete are called jerks...\n\nIn the savanna, our ancestors surely competed a little... who can find the\nbest prey?... but what made them so fierce was cooperation. It was their\ndefault model. Most times, human beings did not fight each other. They either\navoided each other, or collaborated.\n\nWar is very much a product of civilization.\n\nReply\n\n  49. rijkswaanvijand says:\n\nAugust 18, 2014 at 3:20 am\n\n\u201cTake the regular jobs.

He didn\u2019t have much of a problem with\nethnically German bankers; when he railed against \u201cbankers,\u201d he was using it\nas a code word for \u201cJews.\u201d)\n\nLeopold II was king of Belgium, but he wasn\u2019t killing Belgians. As White\npoints out, hereditary rulers generally aren\u2019t among the really big killers.\nLeopold II was an exception: his high death toll came in the Congo Free State,\nand it was a result of a company where he was the CEO.\n\nYou also have the British East India Company, which killed millions through\nfamines. White noted there was one time in the 1870s where a famine death toll\nwas held to just 23 people, due to relief on the part of government. However,\nsuch relief was held to be a violation of free market principles. In some\ncases, the rulers of British India, including the East India Company at one\npoint, made famine relief illegal because it would cut into the profits of\nprivate business! Let\u2019s not forget about how the company\u2019s drug-smuggling\noperations led to the Opium Wars, either.\n\nThe actions of United Fruit in Central America, while not creating the 300,000\ndead necessary for inclusion in White\u2019s list of the 100 worst atrocities in\nhistory, were not exactly good for the general population.\n\nReply\n\n  51. Daniel Lemire says:\n\nAugust 20, 2014 at 3:59 pm\n\n@Sam\n\nHitler and many of his followers were staunchly anti-capitalist and socialist.\n\nCiting wikipedia:\n\nAs a Nazi, Hitler had expressed opposition to capitalism, having regarded\ncapitalism as having Jewish origins. He accused capitalism of holding nations\nransom in the interests of a parasitic cosmopolitan rentier class.\n\nIf you read some Nazi propaganda, it does sound strangely similar to the\nsocialist leaders today, except for the racist part. It is complete with the\nbankers stealing everything from the disappearing middle class.\n\nThe reason they fought the communist is that they did not believe the state\nshould make people equal. They believed that different people deserved\ndifferent fates, no doubt based on their race and perceived merit.\n\nReply\n\n  52. Daniel Lemire says:\n\nAugust 20, 2014 at 4:10 pm\n\n@Sam\n\nJust so we are clear, the British East India Company is not an example of\ncapitalism but of colonialism.

Your\ndepartment probably wants you to acquire more social status so that theirs\nwill go up as well. If I want to make a living out of doing research, is there\nany way for me to escape those games?

Daniel Lemire says:\n\nSeptember 22, 2019 at 4:02 pm\n\nWhy would anyone get paid \u201cfor thinking about stuff\u201d? Typically, you get paid\nbecause you provide a service or product of some kind. For example, you may\nget paid to teach students. Really famous people can monetize, up to a point,\ntheir fame, because they can attract others (e.g., students)... but they still\ndon\u2019t get paid for \u201cthinking about stuff\u201d, they get paid, effectively, to\nlicense their brand.\n\nYou should ask yourself whether you want to spend you life \u201cthinking about\nstuff\u201d. That does not sound like a fun game at all.\n\nMaybe you mean that you want to work on some hard problems that people care\nabout... Well, you don\u2019t need much to get this done if you don\u2019t mix up your\ngoals with envy or vanity. Einstein solved many of the important problems of\nhis era while being a clerk.\n\nI have done some of my best research with people who do not even have a\ncollege degree, let alone an academic job.\n\nIf you think you need an academic job, or even a prestigious one, to work on\nhard problems, you are mistaken. But even if you think you do, if you don\u2019t\nhave one, you can create one. Just create your own institution. I am not\nkidding.\n\nOften, to push things forward, you mostly need hard work and dedication, mixed\nin with a healthy done of well chosen collaboration... everything else, all\nthe fancy institutions, contribute little.\n\nSometimes you badly need access to some data or materials, but solving these\nproblems just require some basic entrepreneurship. It can be as simple as\nasking for access.\n\nReply\n\n  56. catfish says:\n\nSeptember 26, 2019 at 4:25 am\n\n> Maybe you mean that you want to work on some hard problems that people care\n> about...\n\nYes, that is what I meant.
