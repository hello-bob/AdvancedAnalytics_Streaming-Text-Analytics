Designed to go hand-in-hand with PCIe 5.0 and PCIe 6.0,\nCopprLink defines both internal and external copper cabling for the latest\nPCIe standards, giving system vendors and assemblers the ability to use wires\nto connect devices within a system, or even whole systems.\n\nThe CopprLink standard is, in practice, a pair of standards sharing the same\nbrand-name under the PCI-SIG umbrella. The internal standard, \u201cCopprLink\nInternal Cable\u201d, is designed to allow for a new generation of PCIe cables up\nto 1 meter in length that are capable of sustaining PCIe 5.0 and PCIe 6.0\nsignaling. Internal CopprLink effectively supplants a host of older internal\nPCIe cabling standards (including the abandoned OCuLink), which were\noriginally designed for earlier generations of PCIe signaling.\n\nAt a high level, internal CopprLink is intended to provide not only host-to-\ndevice connectivity, but even more transparent backhaul applications such as\nmotherboard-to-backplane connectivity, and unique applications such as chip-\nto-chip PCIe connections. In other words, CopprLink allows for cabled PCIe to\nbe used in almost any situation where a PCIe connection needs to be\nestablished within a system. Strictly speaking, CopprLink doesn't replace the\nPCIe CEM connector in any way \u2013 but the relatively thick copper cables have\nless signal loss than PCB traces, making a cabled standard extremely useful\neven for internal connections. PCI-SIG sees CopprLink cables taking hold in\nthe storage and data center markets, product categories where we already see\nPCIe cabling in use today.\n\nThe companion connector standard for internal CopprLink is the SNIA-developed\nSFF-TA-1016 connector, which bears more than a passing resemblance to the\nwidely-used SFF-8654 (SlimSAS) connector. SFF-TA-1016 is available in x4, x8,\nand x16 configurations, and while the PCI-SIG doesn\u2019t go so far as to defining\nwidths within their own standard, the connectors available paint a clear\npicture of the options at hand. Internal CopprLink x4 should be especially\npopular with storage, as we already see today.\n\nTop: SFF-TA-1016 Family of Connectors (Figure 4-1, Image Courtesy SNIA)\nBottom: Sample SFF-TA-1016 x4 Contact Plug and Recepticle (Figure 4-2, Image\nCourtesy SNIA)\n\nMeanwhile, the group has also developed an external cabling standard to cover\nthose same PCIe 5.0/6.0 data rates. External CopprLink cables can go up to 2\nmeters, allowing for board-to-board connections within a rack, and even short\nrack-to-rack PCIe connections.\n\nThe external version of CopprLink also uses a more robust connector, relying\non SNIA\u2019s SFF-TA-1032 standard. Like internal/1016, this is available with x4,\nx8, and x16 configurations, using 44, 68, and 120 positions/pins respectively.\nThe PCI-SIG is expecting this version of the standard to be primarily adopted\nby the AI/Machine Learning markets, which need to move heaps of data between\nsystems. Notably, however, they don\u2019t really expect the storage market to make\nuse of this spec \u2013 instead, they\u2019ll be served by an updated version of the\nclassic PCI Express External Cabling standard.\n\nSFF-TA-1032 x16 Plug and Connector (Figure 4-1, Image Courtesy SNIA)\n\nFinally, a bit farther out on the group\u2019s roadmap, PIG-SIG is also reiterating\nthat they\u2019re working on a new optical cabling standard as well. The workgroup\nfor this project was established in 2023, so the project is still in its early\ndays. Notably, the forthcoming optical standard is intended to be optical\ntechnology-agnostic, allowing for PCIe to be paired with a variety of optical\ntechnologies.\n\nIn the meantime, with the internal and external CopprLink standards completed,\nthe PCI-SIG is hoping to quickly move this cabling into production. Since\nthese are solely cabling standards \u2013 and thus don\u2019t require intensive\ndevelopment efforts such as new controllers or the like \u2013 the group is hoping\nthat their members will have something to show off in time for the group\u2019s\ndeveloper conference this summer, or the Flash Memory Summit in August. After\nwhich, hardware vendors should be able to deploy the new cables relatively\nquickly.\n\nGallery: PCI-SIG CopprLink Press Deck\n\nSource: PCI-SIG\n\nPRINT THIS ARTICLE\n\n  * ### Post Your Comment\n\nPlease log in or sign up to comment.\n\nPOST A COMMENT\n\n## 6 Comments\n\n### View All Comments\n\n  * #### Dr_Mobeyos - Wednesday, May 1, 2024 - link\n\nThey should have gone for an opto-eletic parallel interface, cause thats where\nwe are heading in a few years with NPU cards anyway. Reply\n\n  * #### ballsystemlord - Wednesday, May 1, 2024 - link\n\nI'm surprised they don't have a PCIe 4.0 standard in the above page 15 slide.\nDid they omit it from the slide or did the standard never exist? Reply\n\n  * #### LiKenun - Saturday, May 4, 2024 - link\n\nIf I recall, OCuLink\u2019s PCIe 4.0-capable update was in the works. 4.0 cables\nexist, but I don\u2019t think the standard was ever released officially.\n\n(I have OCuLink cables, adapters, and enclosures professing PCIe 4.0\ncapability, but have often found stability lacking.) Reply\n\n  * #### JTWrenn - Thursday, May 2, 2024 - link\n\nHopefully this will lead to new formfactors for larger m.2 speed ssd's. Reply\n\n  * #### Hresna - Sunday, May 5, 2024 - link\n\nI wonder if this might enable some more novel form factors for SFF pc\nmotherboards with fewer compromises, or perhaps curtail the need of bulky and\nunwieldy gpu riser cables for some designs Reply\n\n  * #### DougMcC - Sunday, May 5, 2024 - link\n\nWith more than 4x the bandwidth of displayport/hdmi and a reach of 2m I wonder\nif anyone is thinking about using this to deliver data to displays.
