This results in many valuable\nraw materials being lost, and can ensure that dangerous materials end up in\nthe environment, according to the foundation.\n\nThe organization is responsible for collecting and recycling electrical\ndevices on behalf of manufacturers. But it said that the average amount of\nelectric waste collected per person in 2023 only increased by 100 grams\ncompared to the previous year. That figure rose to 5.6 kilograms.\n\nThe three best-performing municipalities collected an average of 11.5 kilos of\nlamps, vapes, electric toys, and other e-waste per inhabitant. In comparison,\nthe three municipalities at the bottom of the OPEN foundation's list collected\nonly 1.46 kilos per inhabitant on average.\n\nSteven van Eijck, the foundation chair, emphasized that \"more has to be done\nto realize concrete improvements.\" For example, the foundation thinks that the\nopening times of the recycling centers should be more tailored to civilians'\nneeds.\n\nMunicipalities should then communicate this information in a straightforward\nand easy-to-understand way to the residents so that they know when and where\nthey can hand in their e-waste. \"We have been pushing for this for a while but\nhave been unsuccessful thus far,\" Van Eijck added.\n\nReporting by ANP\n\n## Follow us:\n\n## Latest stories\n\n  * Violence breaks out at pro-Palestinian protest at University of Amsterdam\n\n  * The average person in the Netherlands still throws away too much electrical waste\n\n  * Good year for Liberation Day festivals; Support still needed\n\n  * Criticism on Amsterdam's plan to protect green spaces; Referendum on June 6\n\n  * Prosecutors do not consider Timmermans' statement about Wilders to be a crime\n\n  * Police arrest 50-year-old man for woman's murder in Amsterdam city center home\n\n## Top stories\n\n  * Violence breaks out at pro-Palestinian protest at University of Amsterdam\n\n  * Police arrest 50-year-old man for woman's murder in Amsterdam city center home\n\n  * Pro-Palestinian group sets up tent encampment on University of Amsterdam campus\n\n  * Draft Cabinet deal caught on camera: Strict asylum plan, tax cuts for middle incomes\n\n  * Over 31,000 Dutch people get more than 10 traffic fines per year\n\n  * Cabinet formation talks entering a critical phase, parties must make decisions\n\n\u00a9 2012-2024, NL Times, All rights reserved.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
