Gitlin - 4/23/2024, 2:43 PM\n\nEnlarge\n\nGetty Images\n\n#### reader comments\n\n39\n\nThere's a new Linux distro on the scene today, and it's a bit specialized. Its\ndevelopment was led by the automotive electronics supplier Elektrobit, and\nit's the first open source OS that complies with the automotive industry's\nfunctional safety requirements.\n\nOne of the more interesting paradigm shifts underway in the automotive\nindustry is the move to software-defined vehicles. Cars have increasingly been\ncontrolled by electronic systems during the past few decades, but it's been\npiecemeal. Each added new function, like traction control, antilock braking,\nor a screen instead of physical gauges, required its own little black box\nadded to the wiring loom.\n\nThere can now be more than 200 discrete controllers in a modern vehicle, all\ntalking to each other through a CAN bus network. The idea behind the software-\ndefined vehicle is to take a clean-sheet approach. Instead, you'll find a\nsmall number of domain controllers\u2014what the automotive industry is choosing to\ncall \"high performance compute\" platforms\u2014each responsible for a different set\nof activities.\n\nTypically, there will be four domain controllers. One will handle vehicle\ndynamics and handling\u2014control of the powertrain, ABS, traction and stability\ncontrol systems, and so on. Another will be responsible for driver-assistance\nsystems, managing the radar, camera, and ultrasonic sensors, processing their\ndata, and controlling partially or fully automated driving systems. A third is\ndedicated to the infotainment, and a fourth might control the car's\nconvenience features like the climate or lighting. There also may be a fifth\ncentral controller overseeing everything.\n\nYou should expect to see this approach more often as automakers develop new\nplatforms, and there are already examples from Audi, BMW, McLaren, and Porsche\non the road or arriving shortly.\n\nObviously, some domains are more safety-critical than others. It can be\ninconvenient if the infotainment system crashes while you're driving, but it\nwon't be a safety issue. But if the vehicle dynamics controller crashes, it's\nobviously a lot more serious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat's why SDVs need to use safety-critical operating systems carrying the ISO\n26262 ASIL certification where necessary. With Elektrobit's EB corbos Linux\nfor Safety Applications (that sure is a long name), there's an open source\nLinux distro that finally fits the bill, having just been given the thumbs up\nby the German organization T\u00dcV Nord. (It also complies with the IEC 61508\nstandard for safety applications.)\n\nEnlarge\n\nElektrobit\n\n\"The beauty of our concept is that you don't even need to safety-qualify Linux\nitself,\" said Moritz Neukirchner, a senior director at Elektrobit overseeing\nSDVs. Instead, an external safety monitor runs in a hypervisor, intercepting\nand validating kernel actions.\n\n\"When you look at how safety is typically being done, look at\ncommunication\u2014you don't safety-certify the communication specs or Ethernet\nstack, but you do a checker library on top, and you have a hardware anchor for\nchecking down below, and you insure it end to end but take everything in\nbetween out of the certification path. And we have now created a concept that\nallows us to do exactly that for an operating system,\" Neukirchner told me.\n\n\"So in the end, since we take Linux out of the certification path and make it\nusable in a safety-related context, we don't have any problems in keeping up\nto speed with the developer community,\" he explained. \"Because if you start it\noff and say, 'Well, we're going to do Linux as a one-shot for safety,' you're\ngoing to have the next five patches and you're off [schedule] again,\nespecially with the security regulation that's now getting toward effect now,\nstarting in July with the UNECE R155 that requires continuous cybersecurity\nmanagement vulnerability scanning for all software that ends up in the\nvehicle.\"\n\n\"In the end, we see roughly 4,000 kernel security patches within eight years\nfor Linux. And this is the kind of challenge that you're being put up to if\nyou want to participate in that speed of innovation of an open source\ncommunity as rich as that of Linux and now want to combine this with safety-\nrelated applications,\" Neukirchner said.\n\nElektrobit developed EB corbos Linux for Safety Applications together with\nCanonical, and together they will share the maintenance of keeping it\ncompliant with safety requirements over time.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n39\n\nJonathan M.

It's a laudable goal to keep pushing linux in the\ndirection where it is a viable choice for these kinds of embedded systems, but\nuntil it becomes a philosophical goal of mainline kernel developers I think\nthese kind of distro-specific forks will remain niche and poorly adopted\nbecause the trust just isn't there that it will have the necessary maintenance\nto support a long embedded product lifecycle.\n\nApril 23, 2024 at 3:03 pm\n\n### Channel Ars Technica\n\n#### How Forza's Racing AI Uses Neural Networks To Evolve\n\nToday on War Stories, Ars Technica is joined by Dan Greenawalt, Creative\nDirector of the Forza franchise, who takes us through the colossal potential\n(and many challenges) of utilizing deep neural networks to build sophisticated\nracing AI. Beginning with the original Drivatar AI in Forza Motorsport for\nXBOX in 2005, Greenawalt and his colleagues experimented with computer\nlearning, refining their methods from iteration to iteration. It was once the\nAI system was unshackled from local hard drives and placed online in Forza\nMotorsport 5, however, that the floodgates truly opened. As the AI rapidly\nevolved, producing unexpected new behaviors, the Forza team quickly learned\nhow challenging it would be to wield this two-edged sword in creating\nrealistic opponents.\n\n  * ##### How Forza's Racing AI Uses Neural Networks To Evolve\n\n  * ##### The supercharged Ferrari 488 GTB | Ars Technica\n\n  * ##### Aston Martin's DB11 V12\n\n  * ##### Fast, fun, and freaky: A review of the Alfa Romeo Stelvio\n\n  * ##### The best features of the best cars at the L.A.
