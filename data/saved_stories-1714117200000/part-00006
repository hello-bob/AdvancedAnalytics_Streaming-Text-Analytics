Disruptive. Annoying.\n\nSound is an outcast in Software Design. We may embrace the aesthetics of\nanimation and visuals, but sound is different. It\u2019s intrusive. Unlike visuals\non a screen, you can\u2019t look away or ignore it. It\u2019s enough to make you rip the\nbatteries out of a toy or frisbee an iPad across the room (speaking from\nexperience).\n\nAnd yet, play a video game without sound and its powerful punch lands with no\nforce. Without music, once moving moments in a film become dull, even comical\n(Jurassic Park, Rocky). Sound holds an immense power to elevate any\nexperience\u2014including the most boring of software.\n\n## Sound in software isn\u2019t inherently bad. It\u2019s just been really badly\ndesigned.\n\nWe use sound in every !Boring app, and many have called it out as one of their\nfavorite aspects of our apps. We\u2019ve learned a few things about when to use\nsound, how to design it, and how to implement it. When done right, sound\nunlocks a path to much richer software experiences\n\n#### \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nIf you haven\u2019t worked with sound before, it may be difficult to know where to\nstart. When should you use it? How do you create it? How do you shape it? How\ndo you even talk about it? Let's get in it. <Headphones on>\n\n#### \\--- 1 ---\n\n# When To Use Sound\n\nSound design starts with knowing when to use it and when not to. While I can\u2019t\ntell you exactly where to add sound in your software, I can share a few\nguidelines on where sound adds value.\n\n  1. Communicate something. Sound can be thought of as the voice of your software. It can be a gentle \u201cmm\u201d to acknowledge a common action or a shout to call attention to something important\u2014success or error\u2014particularly when it may happen away from one\u2019s gaze. In games, this is common. Bump into enemy, hear a \u201churt\u201d sound. Collect an item, hear a \u201creward\u201d sound.\n  2. Juice a moment. In a previous essay, I wrote about adding juice (a.k.a \u201cfeel\u201d) to enhance software. Just as you might use animation or action lines to emphasize a key moment, so too can you use sound. Need to celebrate an achievement? Add a sound. Warn against a wrong path? Sound. Enhance an otherwise boring action? Sound. !Habits uses the sound of a satisfying burst to celebrate the moment when you check off a task for the day.\n  3. Create tangibility. Software design is something of a magic trick. That trick is to fool you into believing our software isn\u2019t just a grid of pixels lighting up on a screen. It\u2019s a tangible tray, a hovering popup, a blobby button. Sound, like drop shadows or overshoot animations, can add a sense of materiality to an interface. Think of the crumpling paper sound when you trash a file on macOS. The sound makes the action tangible and gives it more weight when in reality the computer is simply changing a few bits. In spatial design, sound is even more critical when other tactile senses like haptics are lost.\n  4. Shape a feeling. Sound can play a key role in queueing us in on how we should feel in a moment\u2014happy, reflective, alert. In the todo app Clear, successively checking things off a list plays a rising set of notes that builds a sense of accomplishment.\n  5. Immerse you in a world. Sound can stretch software beyond the screen and immerse us in a deeper world. !Weather shows a large sun, but it\u2019s ultimately just a tiny 1-inch circle on a screen that can slide into your pocket. It\u2019s the sound of distant birds chirping that opens up the world to something that feels much larger and inhabited. Games like film often do this with rich music and diegetic sound effects.\n\n#### \\--- 2 ---\n\n# Designing Sound\n\nWhat makes good sound design? As with visual design, good sound design tends\nto resolve practical issues and enhance the aesthetic experience.\n\n### Break the repetition\n\nWhat\u2019s the main common reason most software sounds are annoying? You might\nblame it on repetition. And yet we can find some repetitive sounds like wind\nchimes or mechanical keyboards tolerable, even pleasing. What\u2019s going on here?\n\nThe answer: Variation. On a physical button, minor variations in pressure,\ntiming, & angle create subtly different sounds with each press. If you play\nthe same exact waveform over and over again, it doesn\u2019t matter how good it\u2019s\ndesigned, it\u2019ll get annoying really quick.\n\nThe trick here is to steal a technique from gaming and create multiple\nvariations of the same sound. Create 8-12 variations by varying pitch, volume,\ntiming, or mix and randomly play one variation for every new key press. Or\ntake it further and dynamically adjust a sound (pitch, filters) based on\ndifferent inputs like hit location, velocity, and hold duration.\n\nInstead of repetition, you create texture. At !Boring, we do this on all of\nour buttons and it fundamentally changed how I thought of sound in software.\n!Calculator went from annoying keypresses to a delightful texture. If you\u2019re a\nsound skeptic, trust me, try this one thing and it\u2019ll blow your mind.\n\n### Layer, layer, layer\n\nSound designers often create new sounds or add dimensionality by layering\nmultiple sounds. Think of it like bringing together ingredients when cooking.\nIf your sound needs a build up, you might add a reverse whoosh. If it needs a\nsatisfying moment of punctuation, you might add a clear percussive hit. If you\nwant to lift the mood, you might sprinkle in a few musical tones. Combining\nall of your ingredients not only creates a sound that satisfies your needs,\nbut it tends to create something that sounds entirely new.\n\nLayers can be brought together from any sound source\u2014natural recordings,\nsynthesized, musical instruments. It\u2019s in the combining and layering of\nsources together that you craft what you want your sound to do.\n\n### Build a world\n\nLike a visual or brand system, your soundscape is experienced as a whole where\neach element speaks to one another. Consider how your sounds live together\nwithin a coherent world. Does it sound physical, digital, musical? Experiment\nwith different \u201cworlds\u201d of sound early on to find what aligns with what you\nwant to say. Surprise yourself. Try something unexpected.\n\n### Create relationships\n\nAs with visual design, sounds for actions should never be considered in\nisolation but in how they relate to one another.\n\nSimilar actions like navigation controls or object actions should have sounds\nthat live within the same auditory family and share characteristics like tone,\ninstrumentation, and effects.\n\nOpposing actions\u2014open vs close, prev vs next, send vs receive\u2014shouldn\u2019t use\nthe same sound. They should sound like similar opposites. A sound might be\nplayed in reverse or the emphasis may be moved from the beginning to the end.\nIn this way, the sound intuitively reinforces the directionality of the action\nyou perform.\n\nYou can hear these relationships when scrolling up vs down in !Timer, going in\nand out of detail view in !Weather, and opening and closing the overlay menu\nin !Vibes.\n\n### Listen for inspiration everywhere\n\nSound within the software world can feel like an echo chamber where most\nsounds follow what\u2019s been done before\u2014beeps, clicks, pops. If you want to\nsound like something new, go beyond software. Movies, games, and music all use\nsound in very sophisticated ways that can be co-opted for software. In our app\n!Vibes, we combined sounds from ambient music with nature.\n\nListen to the world around you\u2014the twang of a ruler across a radiator or the\nthrum of the subway train as it resonates through the tunnel at a specific\npitch. Becoming a visual designer begins with learning how to see the world.\nSound design begins with learning how to listen to it.\n\n### Things don\u2019t have to sound like the thing\n\nIt\u2019s common to think something should sound like what it is. A camera shutter\nlike a real shutter and a page flip like a real page flip. But sound doesn\u2019t\nalways need to be this literal. What if it sounded very different? The sound\nfor a page flip could share the characteristics of the sound of a real page\nflip with a long, slow drag but you could use an entirely different tone or\ninstrument to create it. If meeting expectations enables your design to\ndisappear, these moments where you break expectations are what shape the\ncharacter and personality of your software.\n\nIn !Vibes, animals populate the worlds, and if you tap them, will \u201cspeak\u201d to\nyou. But rather than use real world sounds of a hare or deer, we created a\nmusical sound with a unique tone and sequence for each animal. Instantly, you\nrecenter your understanding of this world you\u2019re in as not a realistic world\nbut a highly musical one which aligns with the core purpose of the app.\n\n#### \\--- 3 ---\n\n# Implementing Sound\n\n### Override sound settings\n\n50-60% of phones are in some form of silent mode where sound won\u2019t play. Are\nyou doomed? Not quite. You can override the device sound setting so that sound\ncomes through even when a device is muted (as is done with videos). Be careful\nwith this one, but it works if you combine it with offering better controls.\n\n### Give back control.\n\nGive people control of the sound in your app or experience. Sound is\nintrusive, so let people decide how and when it intrudes their space. Give\nthem an option to toggle off all sounds, or just the background music, or only\nkey alerts. Let them set when sounds play or set volume levels. In !Timer, we\nlet you set the alarm volume. Useful if you typically keep your volume low but\ndon\u2019t want to miss a critical alarm.\n\nSound settings for !Timer\n\n### Pair with haptics.\n\nSound and haptics are close cousins and should almost always be paired\ntogether. Haptics shape our perceptions of a sound. Think of a keyboard key\nstroke or swinging a hammer. Sound can make the same action feel soft or\nprecise, clean or jumbled, heavy or light.\n\nHaptics can also be a substitute for sound in moments where it may be too much\nor just impractical. Good haptics will level up your app while being less\nobtrusive and less limited by user settings or situations.\n\nHaptics for the !Habits checkmark\n\n### Design for your target device\n\nLegendary music producer, Rick Rubin, mastered early Beastie Boys records on\nhis cheap car stereo rather than studio speakers because he knew that\u2019s where\nthe music would be played. Don\u2019t make the mistake of designing sounds\nexclusively inside your studio headphones. Make sure you listen to your sounds\nthe way others will\u2014phone speakers, earbuds, in a noisy environment. You don\u2019t\neven need to code it\u2014just play the sound file over a video.\n\n### Spatial audio\n\nIf you\u2019re really going for immersion, many platforms now support spatial\naudio. Spatial audio places sounds in a 3D volume and when combined with head\ntracking can help sounds feel more anchored within a physical space. This\nusually requires special earbuds or a VR headset to work and is probably\noverkill for most software. However, in the right instances it'll add a new\ndimension of immersion.\n\nWe use spatial audio in !Vibes to create ultra-present focus spaces where\nsounds appear randomly around you. Using an interface element from gaming, we\nuse a minimap to display the location and movement of each generated sound.\n\nSpatial audio and the minimap in !Vibes\n\n#### \\--- 4 ---\n\n# How to Start\n\nIf I was just getting started with sound today, this is how I\u2019d start.\n\n### Get sounds\n\nDesigning sound begins with getting your hands on those sweet waveforms. You\ncan record your own with a simple mic + recorder or pick up existing samples\nfrom sound libraries.\n\nTo help, we've packaged up a collection of our own sounds we use in our\n!Boring apps that you can play around with to get started. !Boring Sound Kit\n\n### Edit sounds\n\nThere are many audio editing tools and none are meaningfully better for this\ntype of audio work, so don\u2019t sweat it. Just grab Logic, Garageband, Adobe\nPremiere, Quicktime, or whatever you have and get started.\n\n### Combine sound + visuals\n\nUnfortunately, most software design tools don\u2019t support audio on the canvas\n(Rive is one that does). Regardless, one simple technique you can use when\ngetting started is to record a screen capture of your interface or prototype\nand compose sounds over the video. We still do this all the time as it\u2019s often\nthe fastest way to sketch out early ideas.\n\n### Hire a Sound Designer\n\nPlaying with sound on your own will get you far. But if you\u2019re serious about\ncrafting great sound & music for your app, I strongly suggest working with an\nexperienced sound designer or composer. I may be mildly musically-inclined,\nbut I\u2019m no sound designer. I\u2019ve never once regretting working with a sound\ndesigner. Their work will instantly elevate whatever it is that you build to a\nnew level. If you\u2019re unsure where to find them, a great place to look is in\nthe credits of your favorite video games.\n\n#### \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nI hope this gives you a better understanding and a few tools to start playing\nwith sound in your own app. Sound has been ostracized for too long because\nmost of us never understood where to use and how to shape it. But just like\nthe typefaces we set, the screens we compose, and the animations we keyframe,\nsound must be designed. As more of our lives are spent in software, we can\nignore sound and live in lifeless software or we can design it with intention\nand embed soul into more moments of our lives.\n\nLet's make the world sound better.\n\n\u2014 Andy & Thomas Williams\n\n#### \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n## Resources\n\n!Boring Sound Kit : Sound kit for playing & prototyping Meta Sound Kit : Sound\nkit from Meta Designing Sound : WWDC '17 Video Freesound.org : Free sounds\nVibes, Weather, Habits, Calculator, Timer : Listen to the sounds in the\n!Boring apps\n\n#### \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n#### \"Serious Play\" is an essay series on how we at !Boring steal from video\ngames to level up software design.\n\n#### Part I : Serious Play\n\n#### Part II : The Future of Design Tools\n\n#### Part III : The World's Most Satisfying Checkbox\n\n#### Part IV : The Sound of Software\n\n### Get notified\n\nRare but never boring essays & announcements.\n\nSmart move.
