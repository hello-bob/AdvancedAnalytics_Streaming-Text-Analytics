To\nsupport these changes, many nations will need to reform their electricity\ngrids, according to analysts.\n\nThe demands on the power grid are \u201ctop of mind\u201d for Amazon, said the company\u2019s\nsustainability chief, Kara Hurst, adding that she was \u201cregularly in\nconversation\u201d with US officials about the issue.\n\nData centers\u2014industrial buildings, often covering large areas of land, that\nhouse the physical components underpinning computer systems, such as cabling,\nchips and servers\u2014are part of the backbone of computing.\n\nResearch group Dgtl Infra has estimated that global data center capital\nexpenditure will surpass $225 billion in 2024. Nvidia\u2019s chief executive Jensen\nHuang said this year that $1 trillion worth of data centers would need to be\nbuilt in the next several years to support generative AI, which is power\nintensive and involves the processing of enormous volumes of information.\n\nSuch growth would require huge amounts of electricity, even if systems become\nmore efficient. According to the International Energy Agency, the electricity\nconsumed by data centers globally will more than double by 2026 to more than\n1,000 terawatt hours, an amount roughly equivalent to what Japan consumes\nannually.\n\n\u201cUpdated regulations and technological improvements, including on efficiency,\nwill be crucial to moderate the surge in energy consumption from data\ncenters,\u201d the IEA said this year.\n\nUS data center electricity consumption is expected to grow from 4 percent to 6\npercent of total demand by 2026, while the AI industry is forecast to expand\n\u201cexponentially\u201d and consume at least 10 times its 2023 demand by 2026, said\nthe IEA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnlarge\n\nArs Technica\n\nEven before the generative AI boom, some major markets were struggling to keep\nup with demand. It can take years for new renewable energy projects such as\nwind farms to gain regulatory approval and be connected to the grid. There is\nalso a need in some places to build new transmission lines that carry\nelectricity from one point to another.\n\nIn northern Virginia, the world\u2019s largest data center hub, power provider\nDominion Energy paused new data center connections in 2022 while it analyzed\nhow to deal with the jump in demand, including by upgrading parts of its\nnetwork.\n\nIn October, the company said in filings to a Virginia regulator that it was\nexperiencing \u201csignificant load growth due to data center development\u201d and that\ngrowing power demands presented a \u201cchallenge.\u201d\n\nIn response to the demand, authorities in jurisdictions including Ireland and\nthe Netherlands have sought to limit new data center developments, while\nSingapore recently lifted a moratorium.\n\nDevelopers are looking to build sites in growing areas such as the US states\nof Ohio and Texas, regions of Italy and eastern Europe, Malaysia and India,\naccording to analysts.\n\nFinding appropriate sites can be challenging, with power just one factor to\nconsider among others such as the availability of large volumes of water to\ncool data centers.\n\n\u201cFor every 50 sites I look at, maybe two get to the point where they may be\ndeveloped,\u201d said Appleby Strategy\u2019s Golding. \u201cFolks are sifting through large\nnumbers of properties.\u201d\n\nThe concerns have driven interest among data center developers in options such\nas onsite power generation and nuclear energy, with Microsoft this year hiring\na director of \u201cnuclear development acceleration.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 2024 The Financial Times Ltd.
