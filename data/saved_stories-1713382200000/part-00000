After the apps\ncreator sold them to a shady company, someone forked the code to continue the\ndevelopment oriented to the original intentions.\n\nTwo other examples of which I learned from F-Droid\u2019s latest weekly report.\n\nGeometric Weather, a weather forecast app, stopped being developed and was\nretired from the store in mid-March, already with the promise that a fork was\non the way.\n\nIt has arrived! It\u2019s called Breezy Weather and has four distinct versions,\nfrom the most purist (with also free data sources) to the traditional. In the\nproject repository, there is an instructions page about these versions.\n\nThe other app, the Android keyboard OpenBoard, had been abandoned for two\nyears. This is far from ideal, but less bad that a group has adopted the\nproject and now relaunched it with another name and a series of improvements\nand bug fixes. It\u2019s called HeliBoard.\n\n\u00ab Mozilla is testing a Firefox built in text translator\n\nSubscribe to my newsletter:\n\nRodrigo Ghedin is a Brazilian journalist covering consumer tech for a small,\nindependent publication called Manual do Usu\u00e1rio. In Notes, he publishes his\nbest writings to a bigger, English-speaking audience.\n\nCC BY-NC-SA 4.0 \u2022 2022\u20132024\n\n", "frontpage": false}
