He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET,\nGizmodo, and Engadget.\n\nApr 23, 2024, 8:55 PM UTC\n\n## Share this story\n\nPhoto by Monica Chin / The Verge\n\nToday, Framework is the modular repairable laptop company. Tomorrow, it wants\nto be a consumer electronics company, period. That\u2019s one of the biggest\nreasons it just raised another $18 million in funding \u2014 it wants to expand\nbeyond the laptop into \u201cadditional product categories.\u201d\n\nFramework CEO Nirav Patel tells me that has always been the plan and that the\ncompany originally had other viable ideas beyond laptops, too. \u201cWe chose to\ntake on the notebook space first,\u201d he says, partly because Framework knew it\ncould bootstrap its ambitions by catering to the PC builders and tinkerers and\nLinux enthusiasts left behind by big OEMs and partly because it wanted to go\nbig or go home.\n\n### Related\n\n  * Framework Laptop 13 review: a DIY dream come true\n  * Framework Laptop 13 (AMD) review\n  * Framework Laptop 16 review\n\nIf Framework could succeed in laptops, he thought, it would be able to build\nalmost anything.\n\nAfter five years building laptops, what might Framework add to the portfolio?\nPatel won\u2019t say \u2014 I only get the barest hints, no matter how many different\nways I ask.\n\nHe won\u2019t even say if they\u2019ll make less or more of a splash than laptops.\nFramework might choose an \u201cequally difficult\u201d category or might instead try\nsomething \u201ca bit smaller and simpler to execute, streamlined now that we have\nall this infrastructure.\u201d\n\nNor will he say if they\u2019ll similarly be bootstrapped by enthusiast gadget\nlovers or skew more toward the everyday consumer. (Patel recently suggested to\nJason Carman that Framework might adapt its marketing to reach more everyday\naudiences.)\n\n\u201cThe first product is the first stake in the ground.\u201d\n\nBut Patel does suggest these new products won\u2019t be one-offs \u2014 that when\nFramework raises funding for a new product category, it builds a roadmap of\nhow to continue that product year after year. \u201cEvery time a product lands on a\nroadmap, we\u2019re not going to say: \u2018That\u2019s repairable, that\u2019s it.\u2019 The first\nproduct is the first stake in the ground.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s $9 million seed round paid for the original 13-inch laptop\ndesign, which has carried on for three generations of components. Framework\u2019s\n$18 million Series A in 2022 paid for the Framework Laptop 16. Now, it\u2019s\ngetting another $18 million for its next expansion.\n\nIt occurs to me: might Framework\u2019s team need to focus on a few lingering\nlaptop issues before moving on to new territory? But Patel says the company\u2019s\nlaptop teams won\u2019t shrink over time \u2014 it\u2019s just that some cohorts, like\nindustrial designers, don\u2019t need to stick around after a design is locked.\n\n(Unlike most laptop companies, locking the design is a plus for Framework\nsince the idea is to let you keep the same chassis year after year as you\nupgrade and repair parts.)\n\nPatel says both the Framework Laptop 13 and Framework Laptop 16 have long\nlives ahead of them, even though he still won\u2019t quite commit to the 16-inch\nmodel getting future GPU upgrades. \u201cYou\u2019ll be the first to know,\u201d he tells me.\n\nThe Framework Laptop 16, with many more modular parts than the original\n13-incher.\n\nPhoto by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\n\nToday, Framework has about 50 employees, and it plans to expand to 60 before\nthe end of the year, with \u201ca bit of additional team growth\u201d in 2025. It\u2019s a\nsmall company that needs to partner to actually produce hardware; I gather\nthat its laptop partner, Compal, for example, does a bit more than just run\nthe assembly lines.\n\nSo if you did want to sleuth out what Framework\u2019s cooking next, you might want\nto take a look at the web of relationships that the company\u2019s building because\nthere\u2019s an explicit hint about that in its press release: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a number\nof early partnership discussions with other startups in our investors\u2019\nportfolios,\u201d one line reads.\n\nAnother line points out that Cooler Master, which designed the thermal\nsolution inside the Framework Laptop 16 and is now a direct investor, might\nhelp Framework build new products, too. \u201cWe have additional collaborations\nwith the Cooler Master team in incubation now.\u201d\n\nFramework also says it\u2019ll let 100 community members invest $10,000 each of\ntheir own money in the company, so long as they\u2019re accredited investors.\n\nFeatured Videos From The Verge\n\nMost Popular\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1. ## Apple announces May 7th event for new iPads\n\n  2. ## Tesla\u2019s in its flop era\n\n  3. ## Steam will stop issuing refunds if you play two hours of a game before launch day\n\n  4. ## Sonos announces redesigned app that puts everything on your homescreen\n\n  5. ## T-Mobile\u2019s new 5G internet plan lets you take your Wi-Fi on the road\n\nFrom our sponsor\n\nAdvertiser Content From\n\n## More from Tech\n\n  * ### The FTC has banned noncompete agreements\n\n  * ### Tesla teases robotaxi ridehailing function in its app\n\n  * ### Apple reportedly cuts Vision Pro production due to low demand\n\n  * ### Tesla\u2019s profits sink as the company struggles with cooling demand\n\n  * Advertiser Content From\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n  * How We Rate and Review Products\n\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Jobs @ Vox Media\n\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
