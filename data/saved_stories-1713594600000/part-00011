In response, we\u2019re excited to now offer Firefox\nNightly for ARM64 as both .tar archives and .deb packages. Keep the\nsuggestions coming \u2013 feedback is always welcome!\n\n  * .tar Archives: Prefer our traditional .tar.bz2 binaries? You can get them from our downloads page by selecting Firefox Nightly for Linux ARM64/AArch64.\n  * .deb Packages: For updates and installation via our APT repository, you can follow these instructions and install the firefox-nightly package.\n\n### On ARM64 Build Stability\n\nWe want to be upfront about the current state of our ARM64 builds. Although we\nare confident in the quality of Firefox on this architecture, we are still\nincorporating comprehensive ARM64 testing into Firefox\u2019s continuous\nintegration and release pipeline. Our goal is to integrate ARM64 builds into\nFirefox\u2019s extensive automated test suite, which will enable us to offer this\narchitecture across the beta, release, and ESR channels.\n\n### Your Feedback Is Crucial\n\nWe encourage you to download the new ARM64 Firefox Nightly binaries, test\nthem, and share your findings with us. By using these builds and reporting any\nissues, you\u2019re empowering our developers to better support and test on this\narchitecture, ultimately leading to a stable and reliable Firefox for ARM64.\nPlease share your findings through Bugzilla and stay tuned for more updates.\nThank you for your ongoing participation in the Firefox Nightly community!\n\nTags: aarch64, arm64, firefox, linux, mozilla, nightly\n\n#### Bleeding edge browsing\n\nDownload Firefox Nightly\n\n#### More articles in \u201ccommunity\u201d\n\n  * ##### Introducing Mozilla\u2019s Firefox Nightly .deb Package for Debian-based Linux Distributions\n\nOctober 30, 2023\n\n  * ##### Firefox Student Projects in 2018: A Recap\n\nMarch 11, 2019\n\n  * ##### Resolved: Fixed \u2013 A short story about a community-reported bug\n\nJune 20, 2017\n\n  * ##### Upcoming Community Efforts Around Nightly\n\nDecember 16, 2016\n\n  * ##### Nightly discussion forums and some of the tools we use\n\nAugust 31, 2016\n\n#### Recent articles\n\n  * ##### Exploring improvements to the Firefox sidebar\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\n  * ##### Customizing Reader Mode \u2013 These Weeks in Firefox: Issue 158\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\n  * ##### Switch to Container Tabs \u2013 These Weeks in Firefox: Issue 157\n\nApril 2, 2024\n\n  * ##### A Better Screenshots Tool and More \u2013 These Weeks in Firefox: Issue 156\n\nMarch 11, 2024\n\n  * ##### Inspector Performance and Other Improvements \u2013 These Weeks in Firefox: Issue 155\n\nFebruary 26, 2024\n\n### No comments yet\n\nPost a comment\n\n###\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nCancel reply\n\n### Recent Posts\n\n  * Firefox Nightly Now Available for Linux on ARM64\n  * Exploring improvements to the Firefox sidebar\n  * Customizing Reader Mode \u2013 These Weeks in Firefox: Issue 158\n  * Switch to Container Tabs \u2013 These Weeks in Firefox: Issue 157\n  * A Better Screenshots Tool and More \u2013 These Weeks in Firefox: Issue 156\n\n### Recent Comments\n\n  * Steve B. on Introducing Mozilla\u2019s Firefox Nightly .deb Package for Debian-based Linux Distributions\n  * Allan Wind on Introducing Mozilla\u2019s Firefox Nightly .deb Package for Debian-based Linux Distributions\n  * ZeroDay on Introducing Mozilla\u2019s Firefox Nightly .deb Package for Debian-based Linux Distributions\n  * jonzn4SUSE on A Preview of Tab Previews \u2013 These Weeks in Firefox: Issue 153\n  * jonzn4SUSE on A Preview of Tab Previews \u2013 These Weeks in Firefox: Issue 153\n\n### Archives\n\n  * April 2024\n  * March 2024\n  * February 2024\n  * January 2024\n  * December 2023\n  * November 2023\n  * October 2023\n  * August 2023\n  * July 2023\n  * June 2023\n  * May 2023\n  * April 2023\n  * March 2023\n  * February 2023\n  * January 2023\n  * December 2022\n  * November 2022\n  * October 2022\n  * September 2022\n  * July 2022\n  * June 2022\n  * May 2022\n  * April 2022\n  * March 2022\n  * February 2022\n  * January 2022\n  * December 2021\n  * November 2021\n  * October 2021\n  * September 2021\n  * August 2021\n  * June 2021\n  * May 2021\n  * April 2021\n  * March 2021\n  * February 2021\n  * January 2021\n  * December 2020\n  * November 2020\n  * October 2020\n  * September 2020\n  * August 2020\n  * July 2020\n  * May 2020\n  * April 2020\n  * March 2020\n  * February 2020\n  * November 2019\n  * October 2019\n  * September 2019\n  * August 2019\n  * July 2019\n  * June 2019\n  * May 2019\n  * April 2019\n  * March 2019\n  * February 2019\n  * January 2019\n  * November 2018\n  * October 2018\n  * September 2018\n  * August 2018\n  * July 2018\n  * June 2018\n  * May 2018\n  * April 2018\n  * March 2018\n  * February 2018\n  * January 2018\n  * December 2017\n  * November 2017\n  * October 2017\n  * September 2017\n  * August 2017\n  * July 2017\n  * June 2017\n  * May 2017\n  * April 2017\n  * March 2017\n  * February 2017\n  * January 2017\n  * December 2016\n  * November 2016\n  * October 2016\n  * September 2016\n  * August 2016\n  * July 2016\n\n", "frontpage": false}
