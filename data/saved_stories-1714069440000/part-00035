H. Winston\u2019s Artificial Intelligence (1984).\nLeafing through that book is quite a blast, in the sense that much of it looks\nlike it might have been written yesterday. For example, the preface begins\nthis way:\n\nThe field of Artificial Intelligence has changed enormously since the first\nedition of this book was published. Subjects in Artificial Intelligence are de\nrigueur for undergraduate computer-science majors, and stories on Artificial\nIntelligence are regularly featured in most of the reputable news magazines.\nPart of the reason for change is that solid results have accumulated.\n\nI was also intrigued to see some 1984 examples of \u201cwhat computers can do.\u201d One\nexample was solving seriously hard calculus problems \u2013 notable because\naccurate arithmetic seems to be beyond the capabilities of today\u2019s LLM-based\nsystems.\n\nIf calculus was already solvable by computers in 1984, while basic arithmetic\nstumps the systems we view as today\u2019s state of the art, perhaps the amount of\nprogress in AI in the last 40 years isn\u2019t quite as great as it first appears.\n(That said, there are even better calculus-tackling systems today, they just\naren\u2019t based on LLMs, and it\u2019s unclear if anyone refers to them as AI.)\n\nOne reason I picked up my old copy of Winston was to see what he had to say\nabout the definition of AI, because that too is a controversial topic. His\nfirst take on this isn\u2019t very encouraging:\n\nArtificial Intelligence is the study of ideas that enable computers to be\nintelligent.\n\nWell, OK, that\u2019s pretty circular, since you need to define intelligence\nsomehow, as Winston admits. But he then goes on to state two goals of AI:\n\n  1. To make computers more useful\n  2. To understand the principles that make intelligence possible.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s hard to define intelligence, but maybe the study of AI\nwill help us get a better understanding of what it is. I would go so far as to\nsay that we are still having the debate about what constitutes intelligence 40\nyears later. The first goal seems laudable but clearly applies to a lot of\nnon-AI technology.\n\nThis debate over the meaning of \u201cAI\u201d continues to hang over the industry. I\nhave come across plenty of rants that we wouldn\u2019t need the term Artificial\nGeneral Intelligence, aka AGI, if only the term AI hadn\u2019t been so polluted by\npeople marketing statistical models as AI. I don\u2019t really buy this. As far as\nI can tell AI has always covered a wide range of computing techniques, most of\nwhich wouldn\u2019t fool anyone into thinking the computer was displaying human\nlevels of intelligence.\n\nWhen I started to re-engage with the field of AI about eight years ago, neural\nnetworks \u2013 which some of my colleagues were using in 1988 before they fell out\nof favor \u2013 had made a startling comeback, to the point where image recognition\nby deep neural networks had surpassed the speed and accuracy of humans albeit\nwith some caveats. This rise of AI led to a certain level of anxiety among my\nengineering colleagues at VMware, who sensed that an important technological\nshift was underway that (a) most of us didn\u2019t understand (b) our employer was\nnot positioned to take advantage of.\n\n## Your PC can probably run inferencing just fine \u2013 so it's already an AI PC\n\nDON'T MISS\n\nAs I threw myself into the task of learning how neural networks operate (with\na big assist from Rodney Brooks) I came to realize that the language we use to\ntalk about AI systems has a significant impact on how we think about them. For\nexample, by 2017 we were hearing a lot about \u201cdeep learning\u201d and \u201cdeep neural\nnetworks\u201d, and the use of the word \u201cdeep\u201d has an interesting double meaning.\nIf I say that I am having \u201cdeep thoughts\u201d you might imagine that I am thinking\nabout the meaning of life or something equally weighty, and \u201cdeep learning\u201d\nseems to imply something similar.\n\nBut in fact the \u201cdeep\u201d in \u201cdeep learning\u201d is a reference to the depth,\nmeasured in number of layers, of the neural network that supports the\nlearning. So it\u2019s not \u201cdeep\u201d in the sense of meaningful, but just deep in the\nsame way that a swimming pool has a deep end \u2013 the one with more water in it.\nThis double meaning contributes to the illusion that neural networks are\n\u201cthinking.\"\n\nA similar confusion applies to \"learning,\" which is where Brooks was so\nhelpful: A deep neural network (DNN) gets better at a task the more training\ndata it is exposed to, so in that sense it \u201clearns\u201d from experience, but the\nway that it learns is nothing like the way a human learns things.\n\nAs an example of how DNNs learn, consider AlphaGo, the game-playing system\nthat used neural networks to defeat human grandmasters. According to the\nsystem developers, whereas a human would easily handle a change of board size\n(normally a 19\u00d719 grid), a small change would render AlphaGo impotent until it\nhad time to train on new data from the resized board.\n\nTo me this neatly illustrates how the \u201clearning\u201d of DNNs is fundamentally\nunlike human learning, even if we use the same word. The neural network is\nunable to generalize from what it has \u201clearned.\u201d And making this point,\nAlphaGo was recently defeated by a human opponent who repeatedly used a style\nof play that had not been in the training data. This inability to handle new\nsituations seems to be a hallmark of AI systems.\n\n### Language matters\n\nThe language used to describe AI systems continues to influence how we think\nabout them. Unfortunately, given the reasonable pushback on recent AI hype,\nand some notable failures with AI systems, there may now be as many people\nconvinced that AI is completely worthless as there are members of the camp\nthat says AI is about to achieve human-like intelligence.\n\nI am highly skeptical of the latter camp, as outlined above, but I also think\nit would be unfortunate to lose sight of the positive impact that AI systems \u2013\nor, if you prefer, machine-learning systems \u2013 can have.\n\n  * Law prof predicts generative AI will die at the hands of watchdogs\n  * Opera browser dev branch rolls out support for running LLMs locally\n  * Why Microsoft's Copilot will only kinda run locally on AI PCs for now\n  * Ex-Amazon exec claims she was asked to ignore copyright law in race to AI\n\nI am currently assisting a couple of colleagues writing a book on machine-\nlearning applications for networking, and it should not surprise anyone to\nhear that there are lots of networking problems that are amenable to ML-based\nsolutions. In particular, traces of network traffic are fantastic sources of\ndata, and training data is the food on which machine-learning systems thrive.\n\nApplications ranging from denial-of-service-prevention to malware detection to\ngeolocation can all make use of ML algorithms, and the goal of this book is to\nhelp networking people understand that ML is not some magic powder that you\nsprinkle on your data to get answers, but a set of engineering tools that can\nbe selectively applied to produce solutions to real problems. In other words,\nneither a panacea nor an over-hyped placebo. The aim of the book is to help\nreaders understand which ML tools are suitable for different classes of\nnetworking problems.\n\nOne story that caught my eye some time back was the use of AI to help Network\nRail in the UK manage the vegetation that grows alongside British railway\nlines. The key \u201cAI\u201d technology here is image recognition (to identify plant\nspecies) \u2013 leveraging the sort of technology that DNNs delivered over the past\ndecade. Not perhaps as exciting as the generative AI systems that captured the\nworld\u2019s attention in 2023, but a good, practical application of a technique\nthat sits under the AI umbrella.\n\nMy tendency these days is to try to use the term \u201cmachine learning\u201d rather\nthan AI when it\u2019s appropriate, hoping to avoid both the hype and allergic\nreactions that \u201cAI\u201d now produces. And with the words of Patrick Winston fresh\nin my mind, I might just take to talking about \u201cmaking computers useful.\" \u00ae\n\nLarry Peterson and Bruce Davie are the authors behind Computer Networks: A\nSystems Approach and the related Systems Approach series of books.
