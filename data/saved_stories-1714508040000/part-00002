You have to have a Qualcomm-\nbased device, it has to either run rooted Android or be a USB modem, but once\nyou find one in your drawers, you can get a steady stream of packets straight\ninto your Wireshark window. No more expensive SDR requirement for getting into\ncellular sniffing \u2013 at least, not unless you are debugging some seriously low-\nlevel issues.\n\nIt appears there\u2019s a Qualcomm specific diagnostic port you can access over\nUSB, that this software can make use of. The 5G capture support is currently\nsituational, but 2G/3G/4G capabilities seem to be pretty stable. And there\u2019s a\ngood few devices in the \u201csuccessfully tested\u201d list \u2013 given the way this\nsoftware functions, chances are, your device will work! Remember to report\nwhether it does or doesn\u2019t, of course. Also, the project is seriously rich on\ninstructions \u2013 whether you\u2019re using Linux or Windows, it appears you won\u2019t be\nleft alone debugging any problems you might encounter.\n\nThis is a receive-only project, so, legally, you are most likely allowed to\nhave fun \u2014 at least, it would be pretty complicated to detect that you are,\nunlike with transmit-capable setups. Qualcomm devices have pretty much\npermeated our lives, with Qualcomm chips nowadays used even in the ever-\npresent SimCom modules, like the modems used in the PinePhone. Wondering what\na sniffer could be useful for? Well, for one, if you ever need to debug a 4G\nbase station you\u2019ve just set up, completely legally, of course.\n\nPosted in Phone Hacks, Reverse Engineering, Wireless HacksTagged 2g, 2G\nnetwork, 3g, 4g, 5g, cellular sniffing, qualcomm\n\n## 3 thoughts on \u201cTurn Your Qualcomm Phone Or Modem Into Cellular Sniffer\u201d\n\n  1. Roger from Fulchester Hackerspace says:\n\nApril 30, 2024 at 4:52 am\n\nNice .... so I\u2019m guessing I could legally sniff my own unencrypted data from\none of my external 4G devices by way of IP address? .... or how would I filter\nthrough all the other traffic?\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  2. Jan says:\n\nApril 30, 2024 at 5:25 am\n\nBe careful about the \u201clegally\u201d part \u2013 that the device isn\u2019t transmitting\ndoesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t run afoul of any telecommunication secrecy laws which\ngo back ages, to the era of paper letters and sealed envelopes.\n\nThat you are physically capable of receiving some signal doesn\u2019t mean you are\nlegally allowed to as well. Check the laws in force in your jurisdiction and\nif in doubt, don\u2019t! Prosecutors and courts don\u2019t like nerdy smartasses trying\nto tell them something doesn\u2019t apply only because it has been written before\ncellphones were a thing.\n\nGranted, this would be both difficult to detect and to enforce but don\u2019t do\nstupid stuff \u2013 such as posting videos on social media/Youtube showing you how\nyou are using such a device and exposing the content of someone else\u2019s\ncommunication. If the regulator catches wind of that you are pretty much\nassured to get a police visit because of the laws on surveillance,\neavesdropping, etc.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  3. Panondorf says:\n\nApril 30, 2024 at 5:32 am\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure I remember that back in the way-old days... when cellphones\nwere still analog and unencrypted the law was that you could listen to\nanything that was unencrypted... except cellphones. There was a specific carve\nout to make cellphone listening illegal. Or was it just selling devices that\nwere capable of it... Now I\u2019m second guessing myself.\n\nWhatever it specifically was, although I am sure more restrictions have been\nadded I really doubt any old ones have been removed. So, like Jan said. It\u2019s\nprobably best not to go posting everything you receive on the internet.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a ReplyCancel reply\n\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.\n(Comment Policy)\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
