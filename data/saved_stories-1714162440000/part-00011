Ming lived\nsemi-openly with his owner, Antoine Yates, in a room of Yates' five-bedroom\napartment on the fifth floor of a large public housing complex in Harlem.\nSeveral other normal and exotic pets were found in the apartment, including an\nalligator named Al in another bedroom.\n\nMing was taken to Noah's Lost Ark Animal Sanctuary in Berlin Center, Ohio,\nwhere he died from natural causes in February 2019. He was buried at the\nHartsdale Pet Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York.^[4]\n\nYates received a 5-month prison sentence for reckless endangerment.\n\n## History[edit]\n\n### Early life[edit]\n\nTwo of the five buildings in the Drew-Hamilton complex (2012)\n\nIn April 2000, Antoine Yates, a 31-year-old part-time taxicab driver and\nresident of Harlem, New York City, purchased Ming, an 8-week-old male\nSiberian\u2013Bengal tiger hybrid, from the BEARCAT Hollow Animal Park in Racine,\nMinnesota.^[2]^[3]^[5] Records indicated that BEARCAT Hollow had previously\nsold a lion cub to Yates, and Yates had found another home for the lion\nshortly after purchasing Ming.^[2]^[3] Yates lived with the animals in\nApartment 5E of the Drew-Hamilton Houses, a public housing complex; for five\nyears, Yates left the apartment only once a day for an hour to purchase\nfood.^[5]^[6]\n\nIn an interview published in 2020, Yates clarified that he first had purchased\nJabba, a lion cub that passed away at a young age, and then he purchased Ming\nand Nemo, another lion cub, as a pair. Nemo was included with the sale because\nhe was ill and unlikely to live long. At the time he acquired Ming, Yates\nalready owned an alligator named Al, which he had purchased legally in New\nJersey.^[6]\n\n### Discovery[edit]\n\nMing's existence became known and reported in the media after Yates was taken\nto the Harlem Hospital Center emergency room on September 30, 2003 with bites\non the arm and leg.^[7]^[8] At the time of treatment, Yates claimed that his\npet pit bull had bitten him;^[9] however, the medical personnel were\nsuspicious, because the width of the bite marks suggested an animal with a\nmuch larger jaw. Later, Yates said he had been bitten while trying to keep\nMing away from Shadow, a cat he had recently adopted.^[10]^[11] That day was\nthe first time Ming had met Shadow. According to Yates, after Ming began\nchasing Shadow, Yates jumped in front of Ming, who bit and clawed Yates\nmultiple times as he wrestled with the tiger. After Ming finally closed his\njaws on Yates's knee, Yates recalled \"That had me going through flashes of\nlife. I was like, 'Oh my god, guess this is where I die at.'\"^[6] Yates\ndeclined to call it an attack, saying it was a natural reaction of Ming's\nfrustration: \"I'm walking around. I'm still alive. I haven't lost a limb. You\ncouldn't even tell I got bit by a tiger, unless I told you and showed you the\nmark.\"^[6]\n\nOn Thursday, October 2, the police received an anonymous tip that \"there was a\nlarge wild animal that was biting people\"; the same anonymous person followed\nup the next day by providing the animal's location at Yates's apartment.^[9]\nYates checked out of the hospital that same day, and following up on the tips,\nan officer of New York City Police Department was sent to his home address to\ninvestigate on October 3. Loud growling noises could be heard through the door\nof the apartment and the officer declined to enter.^[8] The NYPD Technical\nAssistance Response Unit drilled holes through a neighbor's walls and used a\ncamera on a pole to locate Ming. Martin Duffy, another police officer, was\nsent to the roof, from which he abseiled on a rope sling to look through the\napartment's windows. Ming roared at Duffy, who then anaesthetized Ming by\nfiring a rifle with a tranquilizer dart prepared by Dr. Robert Cook, then the\nChief Veterinarian of the Wildlife Conservation Society, which manages the\ncity's zoos.^[12]\n\nAfter being shot, Ming charged at the window from which Duffy had fired,\nbreaking it, then retreated into the apartment. Authorities waited several\nminutes for the sedative to take effect before an animal control team was sent\ninto Yates' apartment. Dr. Cook used a catchpole and gave Ming another\nsedative injection to ensure he would remain asleep during transport. It took\nmore than six men to carry Ming down via elevator to a waiting truck.^[12] The\nteam also discovered Al, a five-and-a-half-foot alligator that Yates had been\nraising in one of the other bedrooms.^[10] Yates was later located at a\nhospital in Philadelphia and placed under guard.^[8]\n\nAfter Ming was discovered in Yates' apartment, questioning of the neighbors\ndetermined that the existence of the tiger had been widely known for at least\nthree years, but as a sort of urban legend.^[8] Yates regularly bought large\nquantities of raw chicken at the local supermarket, and one standing joke in\nthe building was that he could eat so much chicken every day. By 2003, Yates\nwas feeding Ming 20 pounds (9 kg) of chicken, livers, and bones per day.^[12]\nThe downstairs neighbor was aware that Yates owned many animals, in\ncontradiction to Housing Authority rules, and her daughter had once seen Ming.\nThe neighbor added it was not a problem until the summer of 2003, when she\nopened her windows for the first time that year and found her windowsills\nsoaked with urine accompanied by a heavy animal odor.^[13] In addition, Yates\nhad had roommates, who were unaware at first of the animals in the home.^[14]\nAccording to the New York Daily News,\n\n> A woman who shared a Harlem apartment with a 425-pound tiger said yesterday\n> she was terrified at first\u2014but soon got used to living with the man-eater\n> down the hall. Caroline Domingo told the Daily News she couldn't believe her\n> eyes when she spotted the big cat roaming free in the apartment where she\n> and her husband rented a room from tiger-owner Antoine Yates. [...] But\n> eventually, she said, \"We all became family.\"^[14]\n\n### Legal actions[edit]\n\nYates was arrested on charges of reckless endangerment and the possession of a\nwild animal.^[15] Later, his mother was charged with endangering the welfare\nof a child since she had been babysitting children in the apartment. As part\nof a plea agreement to reduce charges against his mother, Yates pleaded guilty\nto reckless endangerment, and eventually served a five-month prison term with\nfive years' probation.^[16]^[17] He was released after serving three months,\nand subsequently he sued New York City for the loss of his pets (including a\nrabbit) and for $7,000 cash, which he claimed had also been in the\napartment.^[18] A judge dismissed the case, calling him full of\n\"chutzpah\".^[19] According to Yates, the suit was dismissed because it would\nhave revealed the New York City Housing Authority had not been conducting\nrequired quarterly inspections of the apartment, as records had stated.^[6]\n\n### Life after New York[edit]\n\nAuthorities decided to move the seized animals to more appropriate housing:\nMing was sent to Noah's Lost Ark Animal Sanctuary in Berlin Center, Ohio,\nwhile Al was given a new home in Indiana.^[20]^[16] For approximately a\ndecade, human visitors were barred from visiting Ming in Ohio, but the\nsanctuary later changed their policy in the interest of enrichment. Ming lived\nin Ohio until he died on February 4, 2019, of kidney and heart failure. His\nremains were cremated and interred at Hartsdale Pet Cemetery in Hartsdale, New\nYork on April 20.^[21] The cemetery donated the site and mausoleum.^[22]\nAccording to the director of Noah's Lost Ark, \"[Ming] lived a really good life\nhere. He was able to run and play on the grounds. He had tiger friends. He had\na swimming pool. He was able to experience the elements.\"^[21]\n\nAround 2010, Yates stated he lived in Pahrump, Nevada near Las Vegas with 22\nbig cats, including four tigers, having redubbed himself \"Antoine Tigermann\nYates\".^[2] He established the Reach Out And Respond (ROAR) Foundation in\n2011.^[23] A 2018 article in the New York Post cast doubt on Yates's veracity,\nnoting that a licensed tiger owner in Pahrump stated that Yates had never\nlived in Nevada.^[12] A 2020 interview with Yates stated that he was living in\nPhiladelphia with his mother and \"a more humble collection of snakes, lizards,\nturtles, tortoises and chinchillas\".^[6] He was dismissive of the people\ndocumented in the Netflix mini-series Tiger King, calling them \"ignorant ...\nso-called exotic animal lovers.\"^[5]\n\n## In media[edit]\n\nIn October 2010, the story of Yates and Ming was dramatized on the Animal\nPlanet show Fatal Attractions. The episode was titled \"A Tiger Loose in\nHarlem\". A mix of re-creation and documented footage was used, complete with\ncommentary by Yates, his family and police.^[11]\n\nMing is mentioned in the documentary film, The Tiger Next Door.\n\nMing of Harlem: Twenty-One Storeys in the Air was screened at the New York\nFilm Festival on October 3, 2014.^[24]\n\nA photo of Ming was used by New York City rap group Armand Hammer for the\ncover of their 2020 album Shrines.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"Tiger Captured in New York Apartment; Owner To Face Fines\".
