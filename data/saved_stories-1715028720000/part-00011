It is part of readability, along with naming and\nstructuring.\n\nIf you do a quick visual scan of some suspect code and you see asymmetric\nparts, it quickly tells you that you should spend a little more time there.\n\nSymmetry issues can be simple, for instance:\n\nif condition { // do thing one\n\n} else { if sub-condition { // do thing two\n\n} else { // do thing three\n\n} }\n\nDoesn\u2019t seem to be a problem, but that second conditional block is broken into\ntwo sub-blocks, while the first one is not. It is unbalanced. There are 3\ndifferent things that can be triggered from this code. That is a little odd,\ngiven that most permutations are independent and applied consistently, so it\ncould really be 4 things. We may be missing one. Depending on what behavior\nyou are investigating, this would deserve closer inspection.\n\nThat makes symmetry an indirect property of readability. For example, you\nquickly scan large amounts of code to see that every function definition has\nexactly 3 arguments, and then you come across one with 7. Hmmmm. It stands\nout, maybe it is wrong.\n\nWith good code, given most bugs, you will have a strong idea about where the\nproblem is located. Then a quick scan for asymmetry will highlight some parts\naround there that are off. You double-check those, and maybe find one that is\nwonky. That can get you from the report of the bug to the actual flaw in the\ncode in a few minutes, with a fairly low cognitive effort. All you need to do\nis correct it and test that it is now behaving as expected. Symmetry problems\nare often second in frequency to typos.\n\nSymmetry is entirely missing in spaghetti code. The logic wobbles all over the\nplace doing unexpected work. Jumping around. If you are not the author, the\nflow makes no sense. It takes a lot of cognitive effort to hypothesize about\nany sort of behavior, and then you have to focus in on as little as possible,\njust to figure out how to alter it in a way that hopefully is better.\n\nIt\u2019s why debugging someone else\u2019s mess is so painful.\n\nSymmetry is not an accidental property. It is there only because someone had\nthe discipline to make sure it is there. They pounded out some code but went\nback to it later and cleaned it up. Fixed the names, made sure it only does\none thing, and put in as much symmetry as they can. That took them longer\ninitially, but it will pay off later. The worse the code, the more you will\nneed to revisit it.\n\nSymmetry can occur at the syntax level, the semantic level, the data level,\nthe function level, and the structural level. Everywhere. It is a sign of\norganization. Where and when it could have been there, but is missing, it is\nalways suspect.\n\nThe most obvious example is indenting lines of code. Most languages allow you\nto do whatever you want, but if you do it properly that will be a form of\nline-by-line symmetry which helps make the flow more understandable.\n\nSpending the time to find and enhance symmetry saves a huge amount of grief\nlater with quality issues. The code is way easier to refactor, debug, and\nextend. It is worth the time.\n\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest\n\n#### No comments:\n\n#### Post a Comment\n\nThanks for the Feedback!\n\nOlder Post Home\n\nSubscribe
