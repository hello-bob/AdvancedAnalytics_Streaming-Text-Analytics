Every birthday after that I\nadded more bits of advice for them until I had a whole book of bits. That book\nwas published a year ago as Excellent Advice for Living, which many people\ntell me they read very slowly, just one bit per day. In a few days I will turn\n73, so again on my birthday, I offer an additional set of 101 bits of advice I\nwished I had known earlier. None of these appear in the book; they are all\nnew. If you enjoy these, or find they resonate with your own experience, there\nare 460 more bits in my Excellent Advice book, all neatly bound between hard\ncovers, in a handy size, ready to gift to a person younger than yourself. \u2013 KK\n\n\u2022 The best way to criticize something is to make something better.\n\n\u2022 Admitting that \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d at least once a day will make you a better\nperson.\n\n\u2022 Forget trying to decide what your life\u2019s destiny is. That\u2019s too grand.\nInstead, just figure out what you should do in the next 2 years.\n\n\u2022 Aim to be effective, but unpredictable. That is, you want to act in a way\nthat AIs have trouble modeling or imitating. That makes you irreplaceable.\n\n\u2022 Whenever you hug someone, be the last to let go.\n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t save up the good stuff (fancy wine, or china) for that rare occasion\nthat will never happen; instead use them whenever you can.\n\n\u2022 The best gardening advice: find what you can grow well and grow lots and\nlots of it.\n\n\u2022 Never hesitate to invest in yourself\u2014to pay for a class, a course, a new\nskill. These modest expenditures pay outsized dividends.\n\n\u2022 Try to define yourself by what you love and embrace, rather than what you\nhate and refuse.\n\n\u2022 Read a lot of history so you can understand how weird the past was; that way\nyou will be comfortable with how weird the future will be.\n\n\u2022 To make a room luxurious, remove things, rather than add things.\n\n\u2022 Interview your parents while they are still alive. Keep asking questions\nwhile you record. You\u2019ll learn amazing things. Or hire someone to make their\nstory into an oral history, or documentary, or book. This will be a tremendous\ngift to them and to your family.\n\n\u2022 If you think someone is normal, you don\u2019t know them very well. Normalcy is a\nfiction. Your job is to discover their weird genius.\n\n\u2022 When shopping for anything physical (souvenirs, furniture, books, tools,\nshoes, equipment), ask yourself: where will this go? Don\u2019t buy it unless there\nis a place it can live. Something may need to leave in order for something\nelse to come in.\n\n\u2022 You owe everyone a second chance, but not a third.\n\n\u2022 When someone texts you they are running late, double the time they give you.\nIf they say they\u2019ll be there in 5, make that 10; if 10, it\u2019ll be 20; if 20,\ncount on 40.\n\n\u2022 Multitasking is a myth. Don\u2019t text while walking, running, biking or\ndriving. Nobody will miss you if you just stop for a minute.\n\n\u2022 You can become the world\u2019s best in something primarily by caring more about\nit than anyone else.\n\n\u2022 Asking \u201cwhat-if?\u201d about your past is a waste of time; asking \u201cwhat-if?\u201d\nabout your future is tremendously productive.\n\n\u2022 Try to make the kind of art and things that will inspire others to make art\nand things.\n\n\u2022 Once a month take a different route home, enter your house by a different\ndoor, and sit in a different chair at dinner. No ruts.\n\n\u2022 Where you live\u2014what city, what country\u2014has more impact on your well being\nthan any other factor. Where you live is one of the few things in your life\nyou can choose and change.\n\n\u2022 Every now and then throw a memorable party. The price will be steep, but\nlong afterwards you will remember the party, whereas you won\u2019t remember how\nmuch is in your checking account.\n\n\u2022 Most arguments are not really about the argument, so most arguments can\u2019t be\nwon by arguing.\n\n\u2022 The surest way to be successful is to invent your own definition of success.\nShoot your arrows first and then paint a bull\u2019s eye around where they land.\nYou\u2019re the winner!\n\n\u2022 When remodeling a home interior use big pieces of cardboard to mock-up your\nalterations at life size. Seeing things, such as counters, at actual size will\nchange your plans, and it is so much easier to make modifications with duct\ntape and scissors.\n\n\u2022 There should be at least one thing in your life you enjoy despite being no\ngood at it. This is your play time, which will keep you young. Never apologize\nfor it.\n\n\u2022 Changing your mind about important things is not a consequence of stupidity,\nbut a sign of intelligence.\n\n\u2022 You have 5 minutes to act on a new idea before it disappears from your mind.\n\n\u2022 What is important is seldom urgent and what is urgent is seldom important.\nTo get the important stuff done, avoid the demands of the urgent.\n\n\u2022 Three situations where you\u2019ll never regret ordering too much: when you are\npouring concrete, when you are choosing a battery, and when you are getting\nice for a party.\n\n\u2022 The patience you need for big things, is developed by your patience with the\nlittle things.\n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t fear failure. Fear average.\n\n\u2022 When you are stuck or overwhelmed, focus on the smallest possible thing that\nmoves your project forward.\n\n\u2022 In a museum you need to spend at least 10 minutes with an artwork to truly\nsee it. Aim to view 5 pieces at 10 minutes each rather than 100 at 30 seconds\neach.\n\n\u2022 For steady satisfaction, work on improving your worst days, rather than your\nbest days.\n\n\u2022 Your decisions will become wiser when you consider these three words:\n\u201c...and then what?\u201d for each choice.\n\n\u2022 If possible, every room should be constructed to provide light from two\nsides. Rooms with light from only one side are used less often, so when you\nhave a choice, go with light from two sides.\n\n\u2022 Never accept a work meeting until you\u2019ve seen the agenda and know what\ndecisions need to be made. If no decisions need to be made, skip the meeting.\n\n\u2022 You have no obligation to like everyone, and you are free to intensely\ndislike a person. But you owe everyone\u2014even those you dislike\u2014basic respect.\n\n\u2022 When you find yourself procrastinating, don\u2019t resist. Instead lean into it.\nProcrastinate 100%. Try to do absolutely nothing for 5 minutes. Make it your\njob. You\u2019ll fail. After 5 minutes, you\u2019ll be ready and eager to work.\n\n\u2022 If you want to know how good a surgeon is, don\u2019t ask other doctors. Ask the\nnurses.\n\n\u2022 There is a profound difference between thinking less of yourself (not\nuseful), and thinking of yourself less (better).\n\n\u2022 Strong opinions, clearly stated, but loosely held is the recipe for an\nintellectual life. Always ask yourself: what would change my mind?\n\n\u2022 You can not truly become yourself, by yourself. Becoming one-of-a-kind is\nnot a solo job. Paradoxically you need everyone else in the world to help make\nyou unique.\n\n\u2022 If you need emergency help from a bystander, command them what to do. By\ngiving them an assignment, you transform them from bewildered bystander to a\nresponsible assistant.\n\n\u2022 The most common mistake we make is to do a great job on an unimportant task.\n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t work for a company you would not invest money in, because when you are\nworking you are investing the most valuable thing you have: your time.\n\n\u2022 Fail fast. Fail often. Fail forward. Failing is not a disgrace if you keep\nfailing better.\n\n\u2022 Doing good is its own reward. When you do good, people will question your\nmotive, and any good you accomplish will soon be forgotten. Do good anyway.\n\n\u2022 Best sleep aid: first, get really tired.\n\n\u2022 For every success there is a corresponding non-monetary tax of some kind. To\nmaintain success you have to gladly pay these taxes.\n\n\u2022 Do not cling to a mistake just because you spent a lot of time making it.\n\n\u2022 For small tasks the best way to get ready is to do it immediately.\n\n\u2022 If someone is calling you to alert you to fraud, nine out of ten times they\nare themselves the fraudster. Hang up. Call the source yourself if concerned.\n\n\u2022 When you try to accomplish something difficult, surround yourself with\nfriends.\n\n\u2022 You should be willing to look foolish at first, in order to look like a\ngenius later.\n\n\u2022 Think in terms of decades, and act in terms of days.\n\n\u2022 The most selfish thing in the world you can do is to be generous. Your\ngenerosity will return you ten fold.\n\n\u2022 Discover people whom you love doing \u201cnothing\u201d with, and do nothing with them\non a regular basis. The longer you can maintain those relationships, the\nlonger you will live.\n\n\u2022 Forget diamonds; explore the worlds hidden in pebbles. Seek the things that\neveryone else ignores.\n\n\u2022 Write your own obituary, the one you\u2019d like to have, and then everyday work\ntowards making it true.\n\n\u2022 Avoid making any kind of important decision when you are either hungry,\nangry, lonely, or tired (HALT). Just halt when you are HALT.\n\n\u2022 What others want from you is mostly to be seen. Let others know you see\nthem.\n\n\u2022 Working differently is usually more productive than working harder.\n\n\u2022 When you try something new, don\u2019t think of it as a matter of success /\nfailure, but as success / learning to succeed.\n\n\u2022 If you have a good \u201cwhy\u201d to live for, no \u201chow\u201d will stop you.\n\n\u2022 If you are out of ideas, go for a walk. A good walk empties the mind\u2014and\nthen refills it with new stuff.\n\n\u2022 The highest form of wealth is deciding you have enough.\n\n\u2022 Education is overly expensive. Gladly pay for it anyway, because ignorance\nis even more expensive.\n\n\u2022 The cheapest therapy is to spend time with people who make you laugh.\n\n\u2022 Always be radically honest, but use your honesty as a gift not as a weapon.\nYour honesty should benefit others.\n\n\u2022 A good sign that you are doing the kind of work you should be doing is that\nyou enjoy the tedious parts that other people find tortuous.\n\n\u2022 Being envious is a toxin. Instead take joy in the success of others and\ntreat their success as your gain. Celebrating the success of others costs you\nnothing, and increases the happiness of everyone, including you.\n\n\u2022 The more persistent you are, the more chances you get to be lucky.\n\n\u2022 To tell a good story, you must reveal a surprise; otherwise it is just a\nreport.\n\n\u2022 Small steps matter more when you play a long game because a long horizon\nallows you to compound small advances into quite large achievements.\n\n\u2022 If you are more fortunate than others, build a longer table rather than a\ntaller fence.\n\n\u2022 Many fail to finish, but many more fail to start. The hardest work in any\nwork is to start. You can\u2019t finish until you start, so get good at starting.\n\n\u2022 Work on your tone. Often ideas are rejected because of the tone of voice\nthey are wrapped in. Humility covers many blemishes.\n\n\u2022 When you are right, you are learning nothing.\n\n\u2022 Very small things accumulate until they define your larger life. Carefully\nchoose your everyday things.\n\n\u2022 It is impossible to be curious and furious at the same time, so avoid\nfurious.\n\n\u2022 College is not about grades. No one cares what grades you got in college.\nCollege is about exploring. Just try stuff.\n\n\u2022 Weird but true: If you continually give, you will continually have.\n\n\u2022 To clean up your city, sweep your doorstep first.\n\n\u2022 Decisions like to present themselves as irreversible, like a one-way door.\nBut most deciding points are two-way. Don\u2019t get bogged down by decisions. You\ncan usually back up if needed.\n\n\u2022 Every mistake is an opportunity to improvise.\n\n\u2022 You\u2019ll never meet a very successful pessimistic person. If you want to be\nremarkable, get better at being optimistic.\n\n\u2022 You can\u2019t call it charity unless no one is watching.\n\n\u2022 When you think of someone easy to despise\u2014a tyrant, a murderer, a\ntorturer\u2014don\u2019t wish them harm. Wish that they welcome orphans into their home,\nand share their food with the hungry. Wish them goodness, and by this\ncompassion you will increase your own happiness.\n\n\u2022 Get good at being corrected without being offended.\n\n\u2022 The week between Christmas and New Years was invented to give you the\nperfect time to sharpen your kitchen knives, vacuum your car, and tidy the\nfolders on your desktop.\n\n\u2022 There is no formula for success, but there are two formulas for failure: not\ntrying and not persisting.\n\n\u2022 We tend to overrate the value of intelligence.You need to pair your IQ with\nother virtues. The most important things in life can not be attained through\nlogic only.\n\n\u2022 If you are impressed with someone\u2019s work, you should tell them, but even\nbetter, tell their boss.\n\n\u2022 In matters of the heart, one moment of patience can save you years of\nregret.\n\n\u2022 Humility is mostly about being very honest about how much you owe to luck.\n\n\u2022 Slow progress is still a million times better than no progress.\n\n\u2022 Recipe for greatness: expect much of yourself and little of others.\n\n\u2022 The very best way to win a friend is to be one.\n\nApril 18, 2024 | 16 Comments\n\n|\n\n|\n\n< Weekly Links, 03/22/2024 |\n\nComments\n\nBack to Top\n\n\u00a9 2023\n\n", "frontpage": false}
