They are\nused by businesses to help plan where to invest, and by central banks, such as\nthe Bank of England to guide its decisions on interest rates.\n\nThe group says that the forecasts it makes for growth the following year in\nmost advanced economies, more often than not, have been within about 1.5\npercentage points of what actually happens.\n\nDespite the Kremlin being sanctioned over its invasion of Ukraine, the IMF\nupgraded its January predictions for the Russian economy this year, and said\nwhile growth would be lower in 2025, it would be still be higher than\npreviously expected at 1.8%.\n\nInvestments from corporate and state owned enterprises and \"robustness in\nprivate consumption\" within Russia had promoted growth alongside strong\nexports of oil, according to Petya Koeva Brooks, deputy director at the IMF.\n\nRussia is one of the world's biggest oil exporters and in February, the BBC\nrevealed millions of barrels of fuel made from Russian oil were still being\nimported to the UK despite sanctions.\n\n  * Russian oil getting into UK via refinery loophole\n\nAway from Russia, the IMF downgraded its forecasts across Europe and for the\nUK this year, predicting 0.5% growth this year, making the UK the second\nweakest performer across the G7 group of advanced economies, behind Germany.\n\nThe G7 also includes France, Italy, Japan, Canada and the US.\n\nGrowth is set to improve to 1.5% in 2025, putting the UK among the top three\nbest performers in the G7, according to the IMF.\n\nHowever, the IMF said that interest rates in the UK will remain higher than\nother advanced nations, close to 4% until 2029.\n\nThe group expects the UK to have the highest inflation of any G7 economy in\n2023 and 2024.\n\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt said the IMF's figures showed that the UK economy was\nturning a corner.\n\n\"Inflation in 2024 is predicted to be 1.2% lower than before, and over the\nnext six years we are projected to grow faster than large European economies\nsuch as Germany or France - both of which have had significantly larger\ndowngrades to short-term growth than the UK,\" he said.\n\n## Conflict in the Middle East\n\nEconomists at the IMF warned that if the Israel-Hamas conflict escalates\nfurther in the Middle East it could lead to rising food and energy prices\naround the world.\n\nContinued attacks on ships in the Red Sea and the ongoing war in Ukraine could\nalso affect the so far \"remarkably resilient\" global economy, it said.\n\nA potential spike in food, energy and transport costs would see lower-income\ncountries hardest hit, it added.\n\n## Russian oil getting into UK via refinery loophole\n\nUS economy\n\nInternational Business\n\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)\n\nUK economy\n\nRelated\n\n## Workers take on car giant Volkswagen in fight for pay\n\n1 day ago\n\nBusiness\n\n## US inflation jumps as fuel and housing costs rise\n\n7 days ago\n\nBusiness\n\n## US bank boss warns interest rates could rise to 8%\n\n9 Apr 2024\n\nBusiness\n\nMore\n\n3 hrs ago\n\n## United Airlines says Boeing blowout cost it $200m\n\nThe firm had to ground its Boeing 737 MAX 9 fleet after a mid-air blowout on\nan Alaska Airlines flight.\n\n3 hrs ago\n\nBusiness\n\n4 hrs ago\n\n## Biden calls for tripling tariffs on Chinese metals\n\nIt is the latest protectionist policy to be embraced by the White House in an\nelection year.\n\n4 hrs ago\n\nBusiness\n\n5 hrs ago\n\n## UK inflation falls as some food prices drop\n\nNew official figures show that inflation, the rate at which prices rise over\ntime, fell again in March.\n\n5 hrs ago\n\nBusiness\n\n11 hrs ago\n\n## Sunak: Our plan is working, delivering brighter Britain\n\nSir Keir Starmer questions how the PM will fund the planned end of National\nInsurance.\n\n11 hrs ago\n\nUK Politics\n\n11 hrs ago\n\n## SAT optional?
