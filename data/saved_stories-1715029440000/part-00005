Since the 1970s, the\ncharity she works for in Amsterdam, De Regenboog, has run day shelters for\nhomeless people \u2013 typically, people with serious addiction and mental health\nissues.\n\nThen, in about 2015, a new kind of client began to appear. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have\nthe usual problems of homeless people,\u201d Kuschel says. \u201cThey had jobs, friends.\nIn every respect, their lives were very much together. But they couldn\u2019t\nafford a home.\u201d\n\nSome are not young, she says. The oldest, last year, was 72. They have,\ntypically, recently been involved in a relationship break-up, had a small\nbusiness fail or been unable to afford a rent rise.. \u201cWe can help some,\u201d she\nsays. \u201cBut we\u2019re just a sticking plaster, really.\u201d\n\nIn a pan-European housing crisis, the Netherlands\u2019 is next level. According to\nindependent analysis, the average Dutch home now costs \u20ac452,000 \u2013 more than 10\ntimes the modal, or most common, Dutch salary of \u20ac44,000.\n\nThat means you need a salary of more than twice that to buy one. Nationwide,\nhouse prices have doubled in the past decade; in more sought-after\nneighbourhoods they have surged 130%. A new-build home costs 16 times an\naverage salary.\n\nProtesters at a housing crisis demonstration in Amsterdam in 2021. Photograph:\nNurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nThe rental market is equally dysfunctional. Rents in the private sector \u2013\nabout 15% of the country\u2019s total housing stock \u2013 have soared. A single room in\na shared house in Amsterdam is \u20ac950 a month; a one-bed flat \u20ac1,500 or more; a\nthree-bedder \u20ac3,500.\n\nCompetition among those who can afford such sums \u2013 such as multinational\nexpats \u2013 is so fierce that many pay a monthly fee to an online service that\ntrawls property websites, sending text alerts seconds after suitable ads\nappear.\n\nMeanwhile, the waiting list in the social housing sector, which is roughly\ndouble the size of the private, averages about seven years nationally \u2013 but in\nthe bigger Dutch cities, particularly in Amsterdam, it can stretch to as long\nas 18 or 19.\n\nFor young people the task of finding \u2013 and keeping \u2013 a home can be all-\nconsuming. A 28-year-old PhD student, who asked not be identified, said that\nin her first three years in the capital she had moved seven or eight times.\n\n\u201cThe shortage is so acute, and people are so desperate,\u201d she said. \u201cTenants\u2019\nrights are supposed to be strong, but in practice ... I\u2019ve had landlords come\nin while I was out, take pictures. I\u2019ve been bullied to get me to move out,\nphysically threatened.\u201d\n\nShe knew no one under 30 living on their own, she said; many were still moving\ntwice a year. She was now in a shared apartment, and would like to live with\nher partner \u2013 but neither dared move out because they might not find a place.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the worst,\u201d she said. \u201cAll these next steps we\u2019re supposed to be\ntaking at our age, as young professionals, they\u2019re just not possible.\nEverything\u2019s just ... on hold. Relationships are being determined by the\nhousing market, and that\u2019s obscene.\u201d\n\nOthers are luckier. In a peaceful neighbourhood 30 minutes\u2019 walk from\nAmsterdam central station, Lukas and Misty are among 96 tenants \u2013 half of them\nyoung refugees with residence permits \u2013 of a so-called Startblok, one of five\naround the capital.\n\nStartblok resident Misty in her Amsterdam apartment. Photograph: Judith\nJockel/The Guardian\n\nSome Startblokken are much bigger, housing more than 550 young people in\npurpose-built \u201ccontainer houses\u201d, some metal, some of wood and sustainable\nmaterials, stacked four or five atop each other. Others, like this one, are\npermanent, brick-built residences.\n\nFor a monthly rent averaging \u20ac400-500 after housing benefit, every tenant \u2013\nwho must be aged between 18 and 27 when they move in \u2013 is entitled to their\nown 20-25 sq metre studio, with its own kitchenette and bathroom, for up to\nfive years.\n\nThere is bike storage, a bright communal lounge with table football, a laundry\nroom and a small garden with a greenhouse. When one studio became free earlier\nthis year, said project manager Jesse van Geldorp, the Startblok received\nabout 800 applications.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about allowing young people to stand on their own feet, establish a\nlife, build a network in a fundamentally broken housing market,\u201d said Karin\nVerdooren, director of Lieven de Key, the housing foundation that launched the\nStartblok concept.\n\nLukas, a German tutor, moved in last November. He greatly appreciates paying\nhalf \u2013 or even less \u2013 the rent that many of his friends on the outside have to\nfind, and loves the community spirit. Misty, 22 and nearing the end of her\nundergraduate degree, agrees.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not alone,\u201d she said. \u201cYou learn so much. The multicultural side is\nbrilliant; I\u2019ve made friends from Syria, Eritrea ... I\u2019m really thankful. And\nknowing that I won\u2019t need to look for a home at the same time as I\u2019m looking\nfor a job is such a big relief.\u201d\n\nBut the Startblokken \u2013 like the multiple temporary accommodation programmes\nfor \u201ceconomically homeless\u201d people in Amsterdam run by Kuschel\u2019s De Regenboog\n\u2013 are drops in the ocean of the vastness of the Netherlands\u2019 housing crisis.\n\nAmsterdam\u2019s Startblok Wormerveerstraat. Photograph: Judith Jockel/The Guardian\n\nQuite how the country got here is a subject of complex and heated debate. The\nNetherlands was short of an estimated 390,000 homes last year; it is already\nfalling behind on a pledge to build nearly 1m \u2013 two-thirds of them affordable\n\u2013 by 2030.\n\nSome factors, such as historically low interest rates and more \u2013 often smaller\n\u2013 households, are beyond government control. But experts say successive\nadministrations have consistently stimulated demand while failing to boost\nsupply.\n\n\u201cThe key features of the housing crisis \u2013 rising prices, increasing\ninequality, shortages of affordable homes and foreign investors infiltrating\nthe market \u2013 are the result of decades of dubious housing policies,\u201d said\nGregory Fuller of Groningen University.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to This is Europe\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to\neconomics to the environment\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

At the same time, subsidies for\nhousebuilding all but dried up.\n\nIn the rental market, the crippling lack of homes and large numbers of tenants\nwho \u2013 for want of an affordable alternative \u2013 remain in social housing despite\nearning more than the maximum allowed have contributed to sky-high private\nrents.\n\nThe European Commission\u2019s independent social policy advisory group has said\nthe Netherlands is in the grip of a \u201csevere housing crisis\u201d, with a \u201ccritical\nshortage of affordable housing resulting in social exclusion and increasing\neconomic inequality\u201d.\n\nPoliticians including Geert Wilders, whose far-right Freedom party (PVV)\nfinished a shock first in November\u2019s general election, have blamed asylum\nseekers, foreign students and environmental laws.\n\nBut in a damning report published in February, the UN special rapporteur on\nadequate housing said, after a two-week visit, that Dutch government policy\nchoices were to blame for the country\u2019s \u201cacute housing crisis,\u201d not asylum\nseekers or migrant workers.\n\n\u201cAn alternative narrative has emerged in the Netherlands that an \u2018influx of\nforeigners\u2019 is responsible,\u201d Balakrishnan Rajagopal said. The crisis \u2013 of both\naffordability and availability \u2013 had, he added, been \u201ctwo or more decades\u201d in\nthe making.\n\nAmong multiple other factors, the rapporteur blamed a lack of regulation of\nsocial housing providers, an absence of rent caps in the private sector and\n\u201cinsufficient attention to the role of speculation and large investors in the\nreal estate market\u201d.\n\nSome of the more recent government moves aimed at easing the crisis may even\nhave had the opposite effect. Several cities have implemented a 2022 law\nbanning buyers of homes below a certain value \u2013 in Amsterdam, \u20ac530,000 \u2013 from\nletting them out.\n\nKarin Verdooren, director of housing foundation Lieven de Key, tells Jon\nHenley about the Startblok concept. Photograph: Judith Jockel/The Guardian\n\nAccording to at least one academic study, however, the measure, intended to\nboost first-time buyers, benefited middle-income buyers \u2013 but also hit lower-\nincome tenants by pushing rents up by 4% as the number of rental properties\nfell.\n\nSimilarly, government efforts to extend rent controls, restricting more homes\nto social tenants earning less than \u20ac44,000 a year and capping their rents at\n\u20ac800, have simply prompted more landlords to sell \u2013 thus driving up remaining\nprivate-sector rents.\n\nWhatever the causes, for those caught up in it the crisis it is tough. Luna, a\nprimary school teacher, has been staying in a friend\u2019s flat while their\nflatmate was away, but recently found a more permanent room after a six-month\nsearch.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just very ... frustrating,\u201d she said. \u201cTo have been born here, signed up\nfor social housing since I was 18, doing a socially useful job with a huge\nshortage \u2013 and still paying a rent I can only just afford, for a room in a\nshared flat, aged 33.\u201d\n\nMore than 1,200 people applied to De Regenboog last year, Kuschel said. It\nhelped 535, finding them homes in apartment blocks awaiting renovation, houses\nfamilies had recently inherited but do not yet want to sell, empty schools,\neven spare rooms.\n\nOne was Iris, 47, an artist and night-club worker who last year had to move\nout of the Amsterdam flat she had lived in for several years because\ndevelopers had bought the whole building. At around the same time, she split\nup with her partner.\n\n\u201cI stayed with friends, I couch-surfed, but it was impossible,\u201d she said. \u201cNow\nI\u2019m sharing, in a place that won\u2019t be developed for a year. I\u2019m safe for 12\nmonths. I think this is what happens when people see properties as\ninvestments, not as homes.\u201d\n\nKuschel, though, said none of it was a solution. \u201cWe are just trying to\nprevent people getting into the negative spiral that comes with not having a\nsecure home,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t provide a permanent one. After a year,\nthey\u2019re on their own again.\u201d\n\nIt was hard to exaggerate the importance of a secure home, she said: \u201cWithout\nit, people stop building families, building futures, putting down roots,\ndeveloping, flourishing. They lose all perspective. Their lives are frozen.\nThat\u2019s the tragedy.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Netherlands\n  * Europe's housing crisis\n  * Homelessness\n  * Europe\n  * Housing\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
