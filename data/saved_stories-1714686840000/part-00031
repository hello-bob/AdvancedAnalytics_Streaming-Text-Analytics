Now imagine it wasn\u2019t a one-off glitch, but it\nhappened all the time: Imagine the locks that secure our electronic data\nsuddenly stopped working.\n\nThis is not a science fiction scenario. It may well become a reality when\nsufficiently powerful quantum computers come online. These devices will use\nthe strange properties of the quantum world to untangle secrets that would\ntake ordinary computers more than a lifetime to decipher.\n\nWe don\u2019t know when this will happen. However, many people and organizations\nare already concerned about so-called \u201charvest now, decrypt later\u201d attacks, in\nwhich cybercriminals or other adversaries steal encrypted data now and store\nit away for the day when they can decrypt it with a quantum computer.\n\nAs the advent of quantum computers grows closer, cryptographers are trying to\ndevise new mathematical schemes to secure data against their hypothetical\nattacks. The mathematics involved is highly complex\u2014but the survival of our\ndigital world may depend on it.\n\n## \u2018Quantum-Proof\u2019 Encryption\n\nThe task of cracking much current online security boils down to the\nmathematical problem of finding two numbers that, when multiplied together,\nproduce a third number. You can think of this third number as a key that\nunlocks the secret information. As this number gets bigger, the amount of time\nit takes an ordinary computer to solve the problem becomes longer than our\nlifetimes.\n\nFuture quantum computers, however, should be able to crack these codes much\nmore quickly. So the race is on to find new encryption algorithms that can\nstand up to a quantum attack.\n\nThe US National Institute of Standards and Technology has been calling for\nproposed \u201cquantum-proof\u201d encryption algorithms for years, but so far few have\nwithstood scrutiny. (One proposed algorithm, called Supersingular Isogeny Key\nEncapsulation, was dramatically broken in 2022 with the aid of Australian\nmathematical software called Magma, developed at the University of Sydney.)\n\nThe race has been heating up this year. In February, Apple updated the\nsecurity system for the iMessage platform to protect data that may be\nharvested for a post-quantum future.\n\nTwo weeks ago, scientists in China announced they had installed a new\n\u201cencryption shield\u201d to protect the Origin Wukong quantum computer from quantum\nattacks.\n\nAround the same time, cryptographer Yilei Chen announced he had found a way\nquantum computers could attack an important class of algorithms based on the\nmathematics of lattices, which were considered some of the hardest to break.\nLattice-based methods are part of Apple\u2019s new iMessage security, as well as\ntwo of the three frontrunners for a standard post-quantum encryption\nalgorithm.\n\n## What Is a Lattice-Based Algorithm?\n\nA lattice is an arrangement of points in a repeating structure, like the\ncorners of tiles in a bathroom or the atoms in a diamond crystal. The tiles\nare two dimensional and the atoms in diamond are three dimensional, but\nmathematically we can make lattices with many more dimensions.\n\nMost lattice-based cryptography is based on a seemingly simple question: If\nyou hide a secret point in such a lattice, how long will it take someone else\nto find the secret location starting from some other point? This game of hide\nand seek can underpin many ways to make data more secure.\n\nA variant of the lattice problem called \u201clearning with errors\u201d is considered\nto be too hard to break even on a quantum computer. As the size of the lattice\ngrows, the amount of time it takes to solve is believed to increase\nexponentially, even for a quantum computer.\n\nThe lattice problem\u2014like the problem of finding the factors of a large number\non which so much current encryption depends\u2014is closely related to a deep open\nproblem in mathematics called the \u201chidden subgroup problem.\u201d\n\nYilei Chen\u2019s approach suggested quantum computers may be able to solve\nlattice-based problems more quickly under certain conditions. Experts\nscrambled to check his results\u2014and rapidly found an error. After the error was\ndiscovered, Chen published an updated version of his paper describing the\nflaw.\n\nDespite this discovery, Chen\u2019s paper has made many cryptographers less\nconfident in the security of lattice-based methods. Some are still assessing\nwhether Chen\u2019s ideas can be extended to new pathways for attacking these\nmethods.\n\n## More Mathematics Required\n\nChen\u2019s paper set off a storm in the small community of cryptographers who are\nequipped to understand it. However, it received almost no attention in the\nwider world\u2014perhaps because so few people understand this kind of work or its\nimplications.\n\nLast year, when the Australian government published a national quantum\nstrategy to make the country \u201ca leader of the global quantum industry\u201d where\n\u201cquantum technologies are integral to a prosperous, fair and inclusive\nAustralia,\u201d there was an important omission: It didn\u2019t mention mathematics at\nall.\n\nAustralia does have many leading experts in quantum computing and quantum\ninformation science. However, making the most of quantum computers\u2014and\ndefending against them\u2014will require deep mathematical training to produce new\nknowledge and research.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons\nlicense.
