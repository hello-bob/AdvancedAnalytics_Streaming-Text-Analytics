As a microkernel, it provides core mechanisms for\nsecurely multiplexing the hardware, but none of the services application\nprogrammers expect, so adopters are forced to develop those themselves.\nFurthermore, a high level of expertise is required to design performant\nsystems on top of seL4. The result is frequently a poor design, and far too\noften people giving up.\n\nThe Trustworthy Systems team at UNSW has now decided to build Lions OS, a\ncomplete seL4-based OS aimed to support the needs of developers of\ncyberphysical, IoT and other embedded systems. Lions OS, named after John\nLions (of Lions Book fame, arguably one of the fathers of open source), is\nbeing designed and implemented from scratch, with the seemingly conflicting\ngoals of high performance, high security and adaptability to a wide class of\nuse cases. Specifically we plan to prove the correct implementation of its\ncritical components.\n\nIn the talk I explain why I think this is not only achievable, but will be\nachieved within 2-3 years, by strictly adhering to the time-honoured\nengineering principle KISS \u2013 keep it simple, stupid! I will present our\ninitial results that show that, with the right design, this simplicity can not\nonly achieve excellent performance (outperforming Linux networking) but also\nenable proofs of implementation correctness. The talk serves as the public\nlaunch of Lions OS -- needless to say, it's open source.\n\n## BibTeX Entry\n\n    \n    \n    @inproceedings{Heiser_24:eo, address = {Gladstone, QLD, AU}, author = {Gernot Heiser}, booktitle = {Everything Open}, month = apr, organization = {Linux Australia}, title = {{Lions OS}: Secure -- Fast -- Adaptable}, year = {2024} }\n\n## Download\n\n  * Slides | BibTeX\n\n\u00a9 2024 Trustworthy Systems\n\n", "frontpage": true}
