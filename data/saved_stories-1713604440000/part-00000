On\nApril 28, 2022, it shuttered, making it the fastest shutdown of any launched\nstreaming service. Despite that discouraging superlative, CNN has plans for\nanother subscription-based video streaming platform, Financial Times (FT)\nreported on Wednesday.\n\nMark Thompson, who took CNN's helm in August 2023, over a year after CNN+'s\ndemise, spoke with FT about evolving the company. The publication reported\nthat Thompson is \"working on plans for a digital subscription streaming\nservice.\" The executive told the publication that a digital subscription,\nincluding digital content streaming, is \"a serious possibility,\" adding, \"no\ndecisions had been made, but I think it\u2019s quite likely that we\u2019ll end up\nthere.\"\n\nCNN++, or whatever a new CNN streaming package might be named, would not just\nbe another CNN+, per Thompson.\n\n\"We\u2019ll know in a few years time if we\u2019re beginning to make progress, even if\nthat still doesn\u2019t look like it because of the aggregation of declining\nplatforms and growing ones,\" he said, requesting patience regarding the next\nchapter in CNN streaming.\n\nThompson noted that success \"won't happen overnight,\" which suggests a slow\ntimeline.\n\n## CNN+\u2019s short ride\n\nThompson told FT that CNN+ was \"a big, bold experiment which was abandoned\nrather briskly.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompany executives discussed plans for a CNN streaming service as early as\nDecember 2020, and in May 2021, employees learned that CNN+ was happening,\nDeadline reported. By July 2021, CNN confirmed the plans publicly.\n\nBut under a year later, CNN+ was no longer available, with the closure largely\nviewed as a casualty of parent company WarnerMedia merging with Discovery to\nform Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) 10 days after CNN+'s launch. The merger\nmeant CNN now had a parent company that already owned the Discovery+ streaming\nservice and HBO Max; it also had interest in merging Discovery content with\nthat of HBO. In August 2022, a few months after CNN+ closed, WBD announced Max\nas its flagship streaming service, merging what was formerly HBO Max with\nDiscovery+.\n\n\"In a complex streaming market, consumers want simplicity and an all-in[-one]\nservice which provides a better experience and more value than stand-alone\nofferings,\" Discovery\u2019s streaming boss J.B. Perrette said in statement\nregarding CNN+'s closure.\n\nCNN+ accrued high-profile news anchors, and in its three weeks of\navailability, it had an estimated subscriber count of 100,000\u2013150,000,\naccording to Variety, which reported that the early figure put the streaming\nservice on track for year-one quotas. However, CNBC later reported that daily\nviewership was just around 4,000, citing an anonymous source.\n\nIn an internal meeting, Perrette showed \"frustration\" that CNN moved forward\nwith CNN+'s rollout despite its parent company's merger plans, according to\nCNN. Perrette reportedly told employees that \"some of this was avoidable.\"\nCNN's report noted that during the merger process, Discovery executives were\nnot legally allowed to communicate with CNN executives.\n\nCNN+'s 29-day existence makes it the shortest-lived streaming service. It took\nthe record from Quibi, which launched in April 8, 2020, and announced on\nOctober 21, 2020, that it was throwing in the towel (Roku eventually bought\nQuibi for cheap).\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n47\n\nScharon Harding Scharon is Ars Technica\u2019s Senior Product Reviewer writing\nnews, reviews, and analysis on consumer technology, including laptops,\nmechanical keyboards, and monitors.
