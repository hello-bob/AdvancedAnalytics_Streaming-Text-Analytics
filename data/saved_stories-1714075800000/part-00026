It used to be that if the phone rang,\nyou answered it. With the advent of caller ID, you\u2019d only pick up if it was\nsomeone you recognized. And now, with spoofing and robocalls, it can seem like\na gamble to pick up the phone, period. In 2023, robocall blocking service\nYoumail estimates there were more than 55 billion robocalls in the United\nStates. How did robocalls proliferate so much that now they seem to be\ndominating phone networks? And can any of this be undone? IEEE Spectrumspoke\nwith David Frankel of ZipDX, who\u2019s been fighting robocalls for over a decade,\nto find out.\n\nDavid Frankel isthe founder of ZipDX, a company that provides\naudioconferencing solutions. He also created the Rraptor automated robocall\nsurveillance system.\n\nHow did you get involved in trying to stop robocalls?\n\nDavid Frankel: Twelve years ago, I was working in telecommunications and a\nfriend of mine called me about a contest that the Federal Trade Commission\n(FTC) was starting. They were seeking the public\u2019s help to find solutions to\nthe robocall problem. I spent time and energy putting together a contest\nentry. I didn\u2019t win, but I became so engrossed in the problem, and like a dog\nwith a bone, I just haven\u2019t let go of it.\n\nHow can we successfully combat robocalls?\n\nFrankel: Well, I don\u2019t know the answer, because I don\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve\nsucceeded yet. I\u2019ve been very involved in something calledtraceback\u2014in fact,\nit was my FTC contest entry. It\u2019s a semiautomated process where, in fact, with\nthe cooperation of individual phone companies, you go from telco A to B to C\nto D, until you ultimately get somebody that sent that call. And then you can\nfind the customer who paid them to put this call on the network.\n\nI\u2019ve got a second tool\u2014a robocall surveillance network. We\u2019ve got tens of\nthousands of telephone numbers that just wait for robocalls. We can correlate\nthat with other data and reveal where these calls are coming from. Ideally, we\nstop them at the source. It\u2019s a sort of sewage that\u2019s being pumped into the\ntelephone network. We want to go upstream to find the source of the sewage and\ndeal with it there.\n\nCan more regulation help?\n\nFrankel: Well, regulations are really, really tough for a couple of reasons.\nOne is, it\u2019s a bureaucratic, slow-moving process. It\u2019s also a cat-and-mouse\ngame, because, as quick as you start talking about new regulations, people\nstart talking about how to circumvent them.\n\nThere\u2019s also this notion of regulatory capture. At the Federal Communications\nCommittee, the loudest voices come from the telecommunications operators.\nThere\u2019s an imbalance in the control that the consumer ultimately has over who\ngets to invade their telephone versus these other interests.\n\nIs the robocall situation getting better or worse?\n\nFrankel: It\u2019s been fairly steady state. I\u2019m just disappointed that it\u2019s not\nsubstantially reduced from where it\u2019s been. We made progress on explicit fraud\ncalls, but we still have too many of these lead-generation calls. We need to\nget this whacked down by 80 percent. I always think that we\u2019re on the cusp of\ndoing that, that this year is going to be the year. There are people attacking\nthis from a number of different angles. Everybody says there\u2019s no silver\nbullet, and I believe that, but I hope that we\u2019re about to crest the hill.\n\nIs this a fight that\u2019s ultimately winnable?\n\nFrankel: I think we\u2019ll be able to take back our phone network. I\u2019d love to\nretire, having something to show for our efforts. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll get it\nto zero. But I think that we\u2019ll be able to push the genie a long way back into\nthe bottle. The measure of success is that we all won\u2019t be scared to answer\nour phone. It\u2019ll be a surprise that it\u2019s a robocall\u2014instead of the expectation\nthat it\u2019s a robocall.\n\nThis article appears in the May 2024 issue as \u201c5 Questions for David Frankel.\u201d\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * The FCC\u2019s Ban on AI in Robocalls Won\u2019t Be Enough \u203a\n  * How Your Phone Company Aims to Stop Robocalls \u203a\n\nRelated Articles Around the Web\n\n  * Stop Unwanted Robocalls and Texts | Federal Communications ... \u203a\n\n5 questionsrobocallstype:departmentstelephonyscams\n\nMichael Koziol\n\nMichael Koziol is an associate editor at IEEE Spectrum where he covers\neverything telecommunications.
