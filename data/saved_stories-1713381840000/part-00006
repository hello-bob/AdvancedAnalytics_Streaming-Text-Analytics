The blast was around 1,000 times\nmore powerful than the Hiroshima atomic bomb. The shocked city dwellers who\nstared at it were blinded instantly. Air temperatures rapidly rose above 3,600\ndegrees Fahrenheit (2,000 degrees Celsius). Clothing and wood immediately\nburst into flames. Swords, spears, mudbricks and pottery began to melt. Almost\nimmediately, the entire city was on fire.\n\nSome seconds later, a massive shockwave smashed into the city. Moving at about\n740 mph (1,200 kph), it was more powerful than the worst tornado ever\nrecorded. The deadly winds ripped through the city, demolishing every\nbuilding. They sheared off the top 40 feet (12 m) of the 4-story palace and\nblew the jumbled debris into the next valley. None of the 8,000 people or any\nanimals within the city survived \u2013 their bodies were torn apart and their\nbones blasted into small fragments.\n\nAbout a minute later, 14 miles (22 km) to the west of Tall el-Hammam, winds\nfrom the blast hit the biblical city of Jericho. Jericho\u2019s walls came tumbling\ndown and the city burned to the ground.\n\nIt all sounds like the climax of an edge-of-your-seat Hollywood disaster\nmovie. How do we know that all of this actually happened near the Dead Sea in\nJordan millennia ago?\n\nNow called Tall el-Hammam, the city is located about 7 miles northeast of the\nDead Sea in what is now Jordan. NASA, CC BY-ND\n\nGetting answers required nearly 15 years of painstaking excavations by\nhundreds of people. It also involved detailed analyses of excavated material\nby more than two dozen scientists in 10 states in the U.S., as well as Canada\nand the Czech Republic. When our group finally published the evidence recently\nin the journal Scientific Reports, the 21 co-authors included archaeologists,\ngeologists, geochemists, geomorphologists, mineralogists, paleobotanists,\nsedimentologists, cosmic-impact experts and medical doctors.\n\nHere\u2019s how we built up this picture of devastation in the past.\n\n## Firestorm throughout the city\n\nYears ago, when archaeologists looked out over excavations of the ruined city,\nthey could see a dark, roughly 5-foot-thick (1.5 m) jumbled layer of charcoal,\nash, melted mudbricks and melted pottery. It was obvious that an intense\nfirestorm had destroyed this city long ago. This dark band came to be called\nthe destruction layer.\n\nResearchers stand near the ruins of ancient walls, with the destruction layer\nabout midway down each exposed wall. Phil Silvia, CC BY-ND\n\nNo one was exactly sure what had happened, but that layer wasn\u2019t caused by a\nvolcano, earthquake or warfare. None of them are capable of melting metal,\nmudbricks and pottery.\n\nTo figure out what could, our group used the Online Impact Calculator to model\nscenarios that fit the evidence. Built by impact experts, this calculator\nallows researchers to estimate the many details of a cosmic impact event,\nbased on known impact events and nuclear detonations.\n\nIt appears that the culprit at Tall el-Hammam was a small asteroid similar to\nthe one that knocked down 80 million trees in Tunguska, Russia in 1908. It\nwould have been a much smaller version of the giant miles-wide rock that\npushed the dinosaurs into extinction 65 million ago.\n\nWe had a likely culprit. Now we needed proof of what happened that day at Tall\nel-Hammam.\n\n## Finding \u2018diamonds\u2019 in the dirt\n\nOur research revealed a remarkably broad array of evidence.\n\nElectron microscope images of numerous small cracks in shocked quartz grains.\nAllen West, CC BY-ND\n\nAt the site, there are finely fractured sand grains called shocked quartz that\nonly form at 725,000 pounds per square inch of pressure (5 gigapascals) \u2013\nimagine six 68-ton Abrams military tanks stacked on your thumb.\n\nThe destruction layer also contains tiny diamonoids that, as the name\nindicates, are as hard as diamonds. Each one is smaller than a flu virus. It\nappears that wood and plants in the area were instantly turned into this\ndiamond-like material by the fireball\u2019s high pressures and temperatures.\n\nDiamonoids (center) inside a crater were formed by the fireball\u2019s high\ntemperatures and pressures on wood and plants. Malcolm LeCompte, CC BY-ND\n\nExperiments with laboratory furnaces showed that the bubbled pottery and\nmudbricks at Tall el-Hammam liquefied at temperatures above 2,700 F (1,500 C).\nThat\u2019s hot enough to melt an automobile within minutes.\n\nSpherules made of melted sand (upper left), palace plaster (upper right) and\nmelted metal (bottom two). Malcolm LeCompte, CC BY-ND\n\nThe destruction layer also contains tiny balls of melted material smaller than\nairborne dust particles. Called spherules, they are made of vaporized iron and\nsand that melted at about 2,900 F (1,590 C).\n\nIn addition, the surfaces of the pottery and meltglass are speckled with tiny\nmelted metallic grains, including iridium with a melting point of 4,435 F\n(2,466 C), platinum that melts at 3,215 F (1,768 C) and zirconium silicate at\n2,800 F (1,540 C).\n\nTogether, all this evidence shows that temperatures in the city rose higher\nthan those of volcanoes, warfare and normal city fires. The only natural\nprocess left is a cosmic impact.\n\nThe same evidence is found at known impact sites, such as Tunguska and the\nChicxulub crater, created by the asteroid that triggered the dinosaur\nextinction.\n\nOne remaining puzzle is why the city and over 100 other area settlements were\nabandoned for several centuries after this devastation. It may be that high\nlevels of salt deposited during the impact event made it impossible to grow\ncrops. We\u2019re not certain yet, but we think the explosion may have vaporized or\nsplashed toxic levels of Dead Sea salt water across the valley. Without crops,\nno one could live in the valley for up to 600 years, until the minimal\nrainfall in this desert-like climate washed the salt out of the fields.\n\n## Was there a surviving eyewitness to the blast?\n\nIt\u2019s possible that an oral description of the city\u2019s destruction may have been\nhanded down for generations until it was recorded as the story of Biblical\nSodom. The Bible describes the devastation of an urban center near the Dead\nSea \u2013 stones and fire fell from the sky, more than one city was destroyed,\nthick smoke rose from the fires and city inhabitants were killed.\n\nCould this be an ancient eyewitness account? If so, the destruction of Tall\nel-Hammam may be the second-oldest destruction of a human settlement by a\ncosmic impact event, after the village of Abu Hureyra in Syria about 12,800\nyears ago. Importantly, it may the first written record of such a catastrophic\nevent.\n\n[Over 110,000 readers rely on The Conversation\u2019s newsletter to understand the\nworld.

Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nTunguska-sized airbursts, such as the one that occurred at Tall el-Hammam, can\ndevastate entire cities and regions, and they pose a severe modern-day hazard.\nAs of September 2021, there are more than 26,000 known near-Earth asteroids\nand a hundred short-period near-Earth comets. One will inevitably crash into\nthe Earth. Millions more remain undetected, and some may be headed toward the\nEarth now.\n\nUnless orbiting or ground-based telescopes detect these rogue objects, the\nworld may have no warning, just like the people of Tall el-Hammam.\n\nThis article was co-authored by research collaborators archaeologist Phil\nSilvia, geophysicist Allen West, geologist Ted Bunch and space physicist\nMalcolm LeCompte.\n\n  * Fire\n  * Geology\n  * Archaeology\n  * Chemistry\n  * Asteroids\n  * Geochemistry\n  * Jordan\n  * Mineralogy\n  * Tunguska event\n  * Geomythology\n  * Near-Earth asteroids\n  * Impact event\n\n### Events\n\nMore events\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * ##### Senior Enrolment Advisor\n\n  * ##### Associate Professor, Occupational Therapy\n\n  * ##### GRAINS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION CHAIRPERSON\n\n  * ##### Faculty of Law - Academic Appointment Opportunities\n\n  * ##### Audience Development Coordinator (fixed-term maternity cover)\n\nMore jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n\n", "frontpage": false}
