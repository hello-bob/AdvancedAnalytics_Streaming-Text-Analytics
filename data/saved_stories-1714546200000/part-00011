This issue is our largest\nyet.\n\nIn it is an intricate ASCII flipbook animation maker, allowing you to print\nout the results, and an app to apply filters to photos you have on your\ncomputer. (As with all productions in this issue, these are accomplished in no\nmore than 2048 bytes.) There\u2019s a curious drum machine \u2014 reading the note in\nthe source code is recommended, as always. There are word-tools, too: a\nnotepad for only a double handful of characters, a sticky-note system in which\ntext becomes overgrown, and an automation of Harry Mathews\u2019s method of\nrearranging words. A bit more tongue-in-cheek are the typing tutor to increase\n(and question) your productivity and the microminiature \u201cAI tool\u201d here, a\nchatbot. Two pieces present systems for composing short airs from which the\nwords fade and devising new grammars to generate short, provocative stories.\n\nNot to be eclipsed by recent events, there are poems astronomical, including\none inspired by avant-garde photos that shows us striking Jovian moons.\nAnother plots where our star and satellite are. Possible translations rotate\naround one text. Of the poems most directly tied to time, one counts up to\nproclaim how long the Web poem has lived while another counts down to state\nhow little life you (dear reader) have left. Another clock offers an ambient\nalternative to typical displays; a poem progresses through the hours,\nrepresenting dreams and impulses. Many Taper poems can be enjoyed momently;\nyou should dedicate a year to meditate on this one. If you can\u2019t spare that,\nlisten to this composition for bells, which lasts just a bit over one and 3/5\nof a day.\n\nDynamic digital texts are generated by a rural, roving force, flitting. From\nlists of a dozen possibilities, one poem renders chance performance scripts.\nWith some levity, an Australian politician is pilloried in a \u201cremix\u201d of\nearlier computational poems. We are invited down a ladder into darkness;\nrising words consider how tools might be used to overcome. There\u2019s an engaging\n(and never-ending) motion picture waiting for you in this issue, too. Chip\naway to reveal a shaped poem; let lines appear with the sunrise. Use a poem to\nenter words of your own and find words within; a tasty example shows how this\ncan be productively done. Dig further and further into the everyday carry; try\nto finish up all those tasks. Imagine that the tools we use always help us\nforge ahead.\n\nEach of the poems in Taper #12 is licensed as free software for you to use,\nstudy, modify, and share however you like.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
