Light greatly determines the appearance of colors and their effect on\nspaces.\n\nNatural light reflects colors naturally, while artificial lights can change\nthe appearance of colors. Cool lights add purity and sharpness to colors,\nwhile warm lights give colors warmth and softness. These subtle details affect\nour experience and responses in interior spaces.\n\nColors and Design Harmony\n\nAchieving harmony and balance among colors in interior design is crucial for\ncreating a comfortable and beautiful environment. Colors should be used in a\ncoordinated and harmonious manner with other design elements, such as\nfurniture, lighting, and accessories.
