The company envisions\nthat CASSIOPeiA could be in space within a decade, providing gigawatts of\nclean energy much more efficiently than solar plants on Earth.\n\nRelated: Can space-based solar power really work? Here are the pros and cons.\n\n\"We\u2019re thrilled to be able to demonstrate the next phase in the development of\nour technology,\" Martin Soltau, co-CEO of Space Solar, said in an emailed\nstatement. \"Space Solar's successful testing of [the 360-degree power-beaming\ntechnology] marks a pivotal moment in our mission to revolutionize space-based\nsolar power.\"\n\nCASSIOPeiA would be placed in geostationary orbit, a path about 22,000 miles\n(36,000 kilometers) above Earth in which the orbital velocity of a satellite\nmatches the speed of Earth\u2019s rotation. As a result, a spacecraft at this\naltitude appears suspended above a fixed region on Earth.\n\nWhile the demonstrator used in the lab experiment was only 1.5 feet (0.5\nmeters) wide, CASSIOPeiA would ultimately be a vast modular structure some 1.1\nmiles (1.7 kilometers) across. The plant, consisting of large, lightweight\nsolar panels and a set of mirrors collecting sunlight, would be assembled in\norbit by robots, and would require 68 launches of SpaceX's next-gen Starship\nmegarocket to deliver all its components to space.\n\n## Get the Space.com Newsletter\n\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events\nand more!\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nThe recently tested component will ensure that the giant satellite has a\nconstant view of both Earth and the sun in order to provide clean energy 24/7,\nunlike solar plants on Earth, which only work during daytime and get affected\nby bad weather.\n\nThe intermittent nature of terrestrial renewable power generation is a major\nconcern, as other types of energy generation are needed to ensure that lights\nstay on during unfavorable weather. Currently, electrical grids rely either on\nnuclear plants or gas and coal fired power stations as a backup, but both\ntechnologies have their problems. Nuclear power plants generate potentially\ndangerous waste, and gas and coal power stations are a source of greenhouse\ngas emissions, which the world is trying to eliminate in order to stop the\nprogression of climate change.\n\n\"This successful test is a really important milestone on the way to making\nspace-based solar power a reality,\" Paul Bate, the chief executive of the U.K.\nSpace Agency, which supports the project, said in a separate statement. \"Safe,\nwireless, 360-degree energy transmission is a game changer and demonstrates\nthe U.K.\u2019s leading position in this new energy revolution, quite literally\nharnessing the power of space to benefit life on Earth.\"\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\n\u2014 Scientists beam solar power to Earth from space for 1st time ever\n\n\u2014 The US Air Force wants to beam solar power to Earth from space (video)\n\n\u2014 Space-based solar power getting key test aboard US military's mysterious\nX-37B space plane\n\nElectrical power generated by CASSIOPeiA would be converted into high-\nfrequency radio waves, which would be beamed down to Earth, where they would\nbe transformed back into electrical power. The demonstration also tested a\nprecision pointing system that would ensure the waves don\u2019t pose any safety\nrisk to humans living around the receiving station.\n\nA single CASSIOPeiA plant could power more than a million homes, researchers\nestimate. Solar power plants in space, although difficult to build, would\nproduce energy 13 times more efficiently compared to those on Earth, as their\nview of the sun is not obscured by atmospheric gases.\n\nJoin our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky\nand more!

How many car loads of coal will it take to put it up there?\n\nI love solar power. I used it for years and even suffered thru many panel\ndisasters from eagle nests, buffaloes, and bullet holes. But it is limited to\nrelatively small power and non-life conditions.\n\nMuch better panels and batteries are needed before solar can compete. Be\nconvenient and dependable. One can solar power his house now, off the shelf,\nbut the battery cost and maintenance eats up any advantage. Just like the cost\nand bother with an EV battery.\n\nHowever we have great older tech that can be used to solar heat water and\nrelieve some grid load. And it really is free. So, no one uses it.\n\nReply\n\n  * Ken Fabian\n\nWe'll have clean energy or else fail on climate and face climate induced\neconomic disasters that may make space solar even harder to achieve, long\nbefore anyone can attempt it. The ability to aim beamed power better has not\nchanged how difficult and expensive such an option would be.\n\nSolar panels right now are excellent and low price - much lower and the price\nis approaching zero; the panels are no longer the costly part. Probably why\n3/4 of all new electricity generation added globally is now solar - because\nmost energy businesses don't really care about global warming. Production of\nsolar is expected to reach 1 TW per year (double current production) before\nthe end of next year - and investments in new solar factories globally is\nexceeded by investments in battery factories.\n\nContinent wide (and possibly intercontinental) transmission lines, growth of\nbattery storage in the grid and in homes and businesses plus the use of demand\nmanagement - avoiding the high cost energy and taking advantage of the low\ncost by changing industrial processes and smart scheduling. And vehicle to\nhome and grid from growing numbers of plugged in EV's - that with smart\nsystems will be a lot more than simple sources of demand. A lot is happening\nthat will make a big difference, with alarmist economic fear of shifting to\nrenewable energy dissipating in the face of it.\n\nBatteries keep getting better - eg CATL releasing new large scale\ncontainerised batteries with 30% improvement on energy density and\nsignificantly longer life. Apparently investing in science and R&D makes for\nbetter batteries - who'd have thought?\n\nPumped hydro is already gaining significant investment - something that wasn't\ngoing to happen until there was a lot of investor confidence that wind and\nsolar would continue to grow enough to need long, deep storage. And there are\noptions for cold climates, such as Finland is deploying - interseasonal heat\nstorage for district heating. A lot of wind coming on line there plus hydro,\nplus nuclear as well as clever use of waste heat for district heating.\n\nWe are better placed than ever to build up low/zero emissions energy supply to\ndisplace fossil fuels - Biden's IRA in the US is only possible because\nalternatives have become low cost enough; even a decade ago it would have\nstruggled.\n\nReply\n\n  * Classical Motion\n\nIt's not the cost of panels. It's the efficiently. Not only of the final\nproduct, the natural states for these rare earths are not rare. But they are\nvery diluted. Requiring very inefficient mining and processing. More\nemissions. Same with batteries.\n\n1 TW of solar power? Just in 2023, China added 37 TW of coal fire. 2024 will\nbe higher. Not to mention India who has a higher demand.\n\nThe 3rd richest man in Asia is an Indian coal broker. India has a cabinet post\nfor coal.\n\nIn the next 10 years, multiples of all man's combined previous emissions will\nbe added. You ain't seen nothing yet.\n\nReply\n\n  * Jan Steinman\n\n\"Houston, we have a problem.

Seems to me you need as tight a beam as\npossible. Energy spread over 359\u00b0 is energy that is not going to the 1\u00b0\ntarget, no?\n\nAlso, energy follows an inverse-square law with distance. Geosync orbit is\nterribly convenient, but so far away. If Elon can get Starlink into homes via\nlow-Earth-orbit satellites, why can't we aim those power microwaves with such\nprecision?\n\nReply\n\n##### Most Popular\n\nI flew Boeing's Starliner spacecraft in 4 different simulators.
