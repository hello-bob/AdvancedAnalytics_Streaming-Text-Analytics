When can you come back\nand show us a prototype?\u201d\n\nThis can be the beginning of a profitable customer relationship or a\ndisappointing sinkhole of wasted time, money, resources, and a demoralized\nengineering team.\n\nIt all depends on one question every startup CEO needs to ask.\n\nI was having coffee and pastries with Justin, an ex-student, listening to him\nto complain over the time he wasted with a potential customer. He was building\na complex robotic system for factories. \u201cWe spent weeks integrating the sample\ndata they gave us to build a functional prototype, and then after our demo\nthey just ghosted us. I still don\u2019t know what happened!\u201d\n\nAfter listening to how he got into that predicament, I realized it sounded\nexactly like the mistake I had made selling enterprise software.\n\nEnthusiasm Versus Validation Finding product/market fit is the holy grail for\nstartups. For me, it was a real rush when potential users in a large company\nloved our slideware and our minimum viable product (MVP). They were ecstatic\nabout the time the product could save them and started pulling others into our\ndemos. A few critical internal recommenders and technical evaluators gave our\nconcept the thumbs up. Now we were in discussions with the potential buyers\nwho had the corporate checkbook, and they were ready to have a \u201cnext step\u201d\nconversation.\n\nThis buyer wanted us to transform our slideware and MVP into a demonstration\nof utility with their actual data. This was going to require our small,\novercommitted engineering team to turn the MVP into a serviceable prototype.\n\nWhen I heard a potential customer offer us their own internal customer data I\nwas already imagining popping Champagne corks once we showed them our\nprototype. (For context, our products sold for hundreds of thousands of\ndollars, and lifetime value to each customer was potentially measured in\nmillions.) I rallied our engineering team to work for the next few months to\nget the demo of the prototype ready. As much as we could, we integrated the\ncustomers\u2019 users and technical evaluators into our prototype development\nprocess. Then came the meeting with the potential customer. And it went great.\nThe users were in the room, the buyer asked lots of questions, everyone made\nsome suggestions and then we all went home. And the follow up from the\npotential customer? Crickets...\n\nEven our user advocates stopped responding to emails.\n\nWhat did I do wrong? In my unbridled and very naive enthusiasm for impressing\na potential customer, I made a rookie mistake \u2013 I never asked the user\nchampion or the potential buyer what were the steps for turning the demo into\na purchase order. I had made a ton of assumptions \u2013 all of them wrong. And\nmost importantly I wasted the most precious things a startup has \u2013 engineering\nresources, time, and money.\n\nIn hindsight I had no idea whether my potential customer was asking other\ncompanies to demo their product. I had no idea whether the buyer had a budget\nor even purchase authority. If they did, I had no idea of their timeline for a\ndecision. I had no idea who were the other decision-makers in the company to\nintegrate, deploy and scale the product. I didn\u2019t even know what the success\ncriteria for getting an order looked like. I didn\u2019t check for warning signs of\na deal that would go nowhere: whether the person requesting the demo was in a\nbusiness unit or a tech evaluation/innovation group, whether they\u2019d pay for a\nfunctional prototype they could use, etc. And for good measure, I never even\nconsidered asking the potential customer to pay for the demo and/or my costs.\n\n(My only excuse was that this was my first foray into enterprise sales.)\n\nBe Ruthless about the Opportunity Costs of Chasing Deals After that\ndemoralizing experience I realized that every low probability demo got us\nfurther from success rather than closer. While a big company could afford to\nchase lots of deals I just had a small set of engineering resources. I became\nruthless about the opportunity costs of chasing deals whose outcome I couldn\u2019t\npredict.\n\nSo we built rigor into our sales process.\n\nWe built a sales road map of finding first product/market fit with the users\nand recommenders. However, we realized that there was a second product/market\nfit with the organization(s) that controlled the budget and the path to\ndeployment and scale.\n\nFor this second group of gatekeepers we came up with a cheap hack to validate\nthat a demo wasn\u2019t just a tire-kicking exercise on their part. First, we asked\nthem basic questions about the process: the success criteria, the decision\ntimeline, did a budget exist, who had the purchase authority, what were the\nroles and approval processes of other organizations (IT, Compliance and\nSecurity, etc.) and what was the expected rate of scaling the product across\ntheir enterprise. (All the rookie questions I should have asked the first time\naround.)\n\nThat was just the starting point to decide if we wanted to invest our\nresources. We followed up our questions by sending them a fully cancelable\npurchase order. We listed all the features we had demoed that had gotten the\nusers excited and threw in the features the technical evaluators had\nsuggested. And we listed our price. In big letters the purchase order said,\n\u201cFULLY CANCELABLE.\u201d And then we sent it to the head of the group that asked us\nfor the prototype.\n\nAs you can imagine most of the time the response was \u2013 WTF?\n\nFigure Out Who\u2019s A Serious Prospect That\u2019s when the real learning started. It\nwas more than OK with me if they said they weren\u2019t ready to sign. Or they told\nme there were other groups who needed be involved. I was now learning things I\nnever would have if I just showed up with a prototype. By asking the customer\nto sign a fully cancelable purchase order we excluded \u201cleast likely to close\nprospects\u201d; those who weren\u2019t ready to make a purchase decision, or those who\nalready had a vendor selected but needed to go through \u201cdemo theater\u201d to make\nthe selection seem fair. But most importantly it started a conversation with\nserious prospects that informed us about the entire end-to-end approval\nprocess to get an order- who were the additional people who needed to say yes\nacross the corporation \u2013 and what were their decision processes.\n\nOur conversions of demos into orders went through the roof.\n\nFinally, I was learning some of the basics of complex sales.\n\n\u2014\n\nJustin stared at his uneaten pastry for a while and then looked up at me and\nsaid smiling, \u201cI never knew you could do that. That\u2019s given me a few ideas\nwhat we could do.\u201d And just like that he was gone.\n\nLessons Learned\n\n>   * In complex sales there are multiple product/market fits \u2013 Users, Buyers,\n> etc. \u2014 each with different criteria\n>   * Don\u2019t invest time and resources in building on-demand prototypes if you\n> don\u2019t know the path to a purchase order\n>   * Use polite forcing functions, e.g. cancelable purchase orders, to\n> discover who else needs to say \u201cyes\u201d\n>\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Print\n  * Email\n  * Reddit\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Save\n\n  * Telegram\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nFiled under: Customer Development |\n\n\u00ab Is a $100 Million Enough?\n\n### One Response\n\n  1.
