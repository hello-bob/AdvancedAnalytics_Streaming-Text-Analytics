It's pretty and has potential,\nbut the rides themselves are short and need some work.\n\nPhotograph: Saga Holographic; Getty Images\n\nUntil this past week, I couldn\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019d been on a bike. In\nthe past decade, I had kids and moved from flat, mostly bike-friendly Chicago\nto the hilly east side of Los Angeles, but I don\u2019t really have an excuse. I\u2019ve\njust been lazy.\n\nI miss it, though. I love the wind in my hair, the speed you get whizzing\naround, and the convenience of going whenever, wherever. More than anything, I\nlike watching the world go by. That\u2019s why I was intrigued when I heard about\nthe Saga HoloBike, which launches today on Kickstarter. It\u2019s a stationary bike\nwith a 27-inch, 4K stereoscopic display mounted in front of the handlebars.\nSaga says the HoloBike can convince riders that they\u2019re actually covering\ndistance, instead of pedaling monotonously inside.\n\n> If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.\n> This helps support our journalism. Learn more.\n\n## Double Vision\n\nThat\u2019s how I ended up on a HoloBike prototype in an apartment in Santa Monica,\nCalifornia. Saga\u2019s founder, Samuel Matson, worked with British industrial\ndesigner Benjamin Hubert and his agency, Layer, to design the bike. Despite\nits stripped-down, minimalist appearance, the HoloBike itself doesn\u2019t seem to\nbe too different from the average video-enabled stationary bike, like a\nPeloton.\n\nFeatured Video\n\nIt has a steel frame and a footprint of about 59 inches by 26 inches, which is\njust a few inches longer and wider than your average NordicTrack. It was\nfairly easy to adjust the seat and handlebars, and overall I felt fairly\ncomfortable.\n\nPhotograph: Saga Holographic\n\nYou can\u2019t get the lenticular effect of the monitor from across the room, but\nwhen you\u2019re seated on the bike, it looks fairly 3D. There\u2019s a globe in the\ncenter of the launch screen that pops out. As I scrolled to the demo ride\u2014a\nquick trip down the Lappa Junction Trail in Queensland, Australia\u2014the\ntouchscreen was responsive.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Gear\n\nAs Elon Musk Abandons the $25K Tesla, This EV Costs Just $4,400\n\nAlistair Charlton\n\n  * Gear\n\nWant to Buy a Decommissioned Supercomputer?

To put it\nmildly, I am not much of a professional cyclist. I huff and puff and bop\naround a bit when I ride, shifting from side to side and up and down in an\neffort to really find the spot that works for me. Because I\u2019m constantly\nmoving, I found the image on HoloBike\u2019s stereoscopic display to be a bit\njumpy. A camera on the monitor reads the rider\u2019s position in space and adjusts\nthe image accordingly, but there\u2019s still a noticeable lag.\n\nThe onscreen images took me out of it, too. All the trails in the HoloBike\nsystem are real places you can go and ride, but rather than going to shoot\nvideo all over the world, Saga virtually generates the dirt paths and mountain\nroads with neural networks. If you didn\u2019t know that the trails weren\u2019t real,\nthere\u2019s a slight chance you might believe in them. To me, it still felt more\nlike a video game than actually tooling around the Outback.\n\nPhotograph: Saga Holographic\n\n## Sticks and Stones\n\nPrior to riding the HoloBike, I tried Supernatural, which is a VR exercise\nexperience that uses the Oculus headset to put users inside an immersive video\nlandscape. Supernatural\u2019s graphics are truly breathtaking, from still photos\ntaken on the moon to shots set just feet from some of the world\u2019s most\ntreasured landmarks. That verisimilitude was lacking a bit with the HoloBike.\n\nI also missed haptic feedback. The HoloBike cruises along unfettered, even\nwhen you might be riding over leaves, rocks, and fairly sizable sticks\nonscreen. Even as leaves and grass drifted in 3D out of the screen, I longed\nto hear the rustle of leaves or the slight jolt of dry wood crunching\nunderneath my wheels, but it just wasn\u2019t there.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Gear\n\nAs Elon Musk Abandons the $25K Tesla, This EV Costs Just $4,400\n\nAlistair Charlton\n\n  * Gear\n\nWant to Buy a Decommissioned Supercomputer? Here\u2019s Your Chance\n\nBenj Edwards, Ars Technica\n\n  * Gear\n\nThey Bought Tablets in Prison\u2014and Found a Broken Promise\n\nGabrielle Caplan\n\n  * Gear\n\nThe Best Fitness Trackers and Watches for Everyone\n\nAdrienne So\n\nMatson told me that he finds wearing a headset to be too cumbersome when\nyou\u2019re working out. In particular, parents told him that they can\u2019t check out\nwith VR because they need to know what\u2019s going on around them. However, I\nprefer to not have any distractions, mainly because I\u2019m horrible at exercise\nand will take any excuse not to do it.\n\nHigh-endurance athletes may find Saga\u2019s offerings a bit slim, too. Matson says\nthe company plans to ship the bikes with three to four trails in the system,\neach about 20 kilometers long. This is not very many rides, and those rides\nare not very long. By way of contrast, NordicTrack has an extensive library of\nrides of all lengths, levels, and programs, which also increase resistance and\nmove up and down as you ride. Other bikes integrate with Zwift, the immensely\npopular online cycling platform, or collect intensely granular data that\nallows you to improve your fitness.\n\nPhotograph: Saga Holographic\n\nAs of yet, HoloBike doesn\u2019t do any of those things. The augmented technology,\nhowever, certainly makes what you\u2019re seeing seem more real. And in some\ncircumstances, not being real is a bonus. If all the trails are virtually\ngenerated, I\u2019d love to have the ability to safely traverse places I wouldn\u2019t\notherwise go, like the streets of Mumbai, or even something entirely\nfictional, like a delivery route from Paperboy, or Elliott\u2019s big take-off from\nE.T.\n\nIt would be cool if there were a possibility for users to design or contribute\ntrails, too. I joked to Matson that they should make some version of a trail\nthat goes all the way around the world, so you could circumnavigate the globe\nover the course of a year\u2019s worth of rides, only to have him suggest creating\na little onscreen pedal boat for when you\u2019re crossing the Atlantic. With the\nHoloBike, the world really is entirely open and limitless. That\u2019s enormously\nexciting.\n\nThat being said, the bike\u2019s starting price tag on Kickstarter is $2,599, with\nexpected delivery in the winter of 2024-2025. That\u2019s comparable to other\nvideo-enabled stationary exercise bikes, but a lot to shell out for potential.\nIf I\u2019m going to ride a bike, I need something that approximates the feeling of\nthe open road a little more closely, and for a little bit longer.\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * Navigate election season with our WIRED Politics Lab newsletter and podcast\n\n  * A hacker took down North Korea\u2019s internet.
