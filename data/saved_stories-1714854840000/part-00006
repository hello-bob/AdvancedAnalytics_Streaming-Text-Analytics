Strolling the seashore\nor diving below the ocean\u2019s surface, we can see the adult forms of these\ncreatures, but what about their earlier stages? Before they settled\ndown\u2014literally\u2014and moved to the seafloor, almost all started life as\nzooplankton, marine fauna adrift on the ocean\u2019s currents.\n\nAlthough zooplankton and phytoplankton, the plantlike drifters that most\nzooplankton will feast on, are in the water year-round, their populations grow\nexponentially early in the year. In spring, the days lengthen, the water warms\nslightly, nutrients flow into the ocean\u2019s surface layers from land or deeper\nwaters, and the phytoplankton bloom. Phytoplankton are microscopic, but as\ntheir numbers increase, their chlorophyll and other photosynthetic pigments\ncause changes in ocean color, which can be measured by satellite imagery and,\nat high enough concentrations, even become visible to the human eye.\n\nA satellite image of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, from July 2023 shows\ncolorful plumes of what is likely plankton and sediment.

Reproductive\nstrategies among animals that produce planktonic babies vary. Many sessile or\nslow-moving animals, such as corals and sea urchins, use a sort of mass-\nmailing technique called broadcast spawning. They release billions of gametes\nin synchrony, with the strategy that at least some of the eggs and sperm will\nmeet up so fertilization can occur. Barnacles, such as the common intertidal\nacorn barnacle, are hermaphrodites and use a long flexible penis to fertilize\nthe eggs of their neighbor. A fertilized egg develops inside its parent\u2019s\nprotective, volcanolike shell until it hatches into a larva and is ejected out\nof the house. Whether released as gametes, fertilized eggs, or larvae, they\nall become part of a seawater soup of microscopic life. While many animals\nspend only a brief time in the soup before they settle to the seafloor or\nbecome more mobile, some species live out the rest of their lives as\nzooplankton.\n\nOur colleagues at the Hakai Institute\u2019s Quadra Island Ecological Observatory,\nin British Columbia, spent over three years sampling and photographing\nzooplankton in the waters off Quadra Island\u2019s eastern shore, a biologically\nbountiful region where the nutrient-rich outflow of glacial fjords meets the\nnorthern extent of the Salish Sea. This research team had a particular\ninterest in capturing larval life forms, which are relatively understudied.\nIt\u2019s astonishing how alien the larval forms of common sea creatures can\nseem\u2014with their massive, stalked eyes, spiny snouts, and translucent bodies so\nunlike the adults they\u2019ll become.\n\nLike many marine invertebrates, barnacles have several free-swimming larval\nstages. They leave the protection of the adult\u2019s shell as a shield-shaped\nnauplius larva, first photo, with feathery appendages and a single Cyclops\neye. The larva will molt six times, adding more segments and appendages. After\nits final molt, the young barnacle is known as a cyprid larva, second photo.\nIn this stage, the larva sinks to the ocean floor and starts searching for a\nhard surface on which to attach. Since barnacles need other barnacles nearby\nfor reproduction, the cyprid touches surfaces with its antennae to pick up the\nscents of others. Once it finds a suitable place, it secretes a dab of glue\nthat secures its head to the surface and grows into an adult barnacle,\ncomplete with a conical shell.\n\nThis winged beauty is the veliger stage of a predatory sea snail from the\nfamily Mangeliidae. The wings, or vela, are covered in microscopic hairs\ncalled cilia. The rhythmically beating cilia create currents that entrap food\nsuch as diatoms for the growing larva. As the larva grows, it develops the\nparts more visible in adult snails, such as a shell, foot, and tentacles.\nEventually sea snail larvae go through a process called torsion, a 180-degree\ntwist that brings the posterior part of the animal toward its head. As the\nsnail\u2019s planktonic life comes to an end, the veliger settles on the seafloor\nand develops into an adult.\n\nA sea star passes through several stages as a free-swimming larva. At first\nits body is covered in cilia, which beat in unison to give the larva some\ncontrol over its motion. As the animal metamorphoses into the bipinnaria\nstage, first photo, the cilia aggregate into defined bands, and the arms start\nto form. At this point, its gut also develops, and the larval sea star begins\nfeeding. Depending on the species, a sea star can spend several weeks or\nmonths as a bipinnaria before it adds more arms and a sucker at its anterior\nend and develops into a brachiolaria larva, second photo. The brachiolaria\neventually settles to the seafloor, sucker end first, and grows into an adult.\n\nScientists often categorize animals by their symmetry. Humans, for instance,\nare bilaterally symmetrical: our right and left halves are mirror images. Up\nuntil the point it settles on the bottom, the sea star is also bilaterally\nsymmetrical. As the larva changes into an adult, its symmetry changes, too,\nmorphing into radial symmetry. (Most adult sea stars and their spiny-skinned\nrelatives\u2014the echinoderms\u2014are more specifically pentaradial symmetrical, with\na body plan based on five.) New research shows that this shapeshifting is\npossible because the tissues that are genetically equivalent to a sea star\u2019s\n\u201chead\u201d are dispersed in its limbs and skin.\n\nWhile some planktonic creatures are unrecognizable from their eventual adult\nforms, others come into the world as miniature versions of their parents. This\nbaby opalescent squid is one of hundreds that hatched from a pickle-shaped egg\ncapsule; adult squid lay mounds of these egg capsules in sandy shallows\nfollowing frenzied mass spawning events, and then leave them to their fate. If\nthe developing jelly-coated eggs survive the gauntlet of opportunistic\npredators and unforgiving waves and tides, the rice-grain-sized hatchlings,\ncalled paralarvae, emerge several weeks later and begin drifting with the\ncurrents. Over the following month or so, they gain the swimming skills needed\nto escape their planktonic lifestyle and hunt in earnest. But in their early\ndays, they can only propel themselves with short pulses of motion as they\nattack copepods and other zooplankton prey. They\u2019re not fully left to their\nown devices from the get-go, however\u2014they\u2019re born with an internal yolk sac, a\nnutritional buffer that gives them time to hone their hunting skills.\n\nThis baby moon jellyfish would fit easily on the head of a pin, but it won\u2019t\nstay this small for long. It belongs to the scyphozoans, or true jellyfish,\nthe typically large and colorful types of jellyfish that most people are\nfamiliar with. Far less familiar, however, are their microscopic larval forms\nknown as ephyrae. This snowflake-esque ephyra is one of a stack of clones that\nbudded off its parent polyp\u2014a sessile, stalked stage of the jellyfish life\ncycle that attaches to rocks, docks, or other surfaces\u2014to drift in the big\nblue. This process of budding, called strobilation, is perfectly timed with\nthe spring surge in plankton, which means plenty of prey for the new ephyrae.\nEmerging into the right temperatures seems to be key for their ability to\ngrow. While adult moon jellyfish\u2014which are still considered plankton, despite\ntheir size\u2014are found in coastal waters of the northeast Pacific year-round,\ntheir ephyrae are a bit pickier about conditions. Too hot and they become\nstressed and die; too cold and they\u2019ll fail to thrive.\n\nWhile this might look like a case of jellyfish cannibalism, it\u2019s actually the\nwild world of jellyfish reproduction in action. Even though it\u2019s no bigger\nthan a fingertip, this adult hydrozoan jellyfish\u2014a relative of true\njellyfish\u2014is partway through budding an even smaller mini-me off the wall of\nits stomach. When adult jellyfish reach maturity, they typically release sperm\nor eggs, which together develop into polyps; but sometimes environmental\nconditions, such as temperature, cause hydrozoan jellyfish to change their\nreproductive tactic and produce mini-mes like this instead. While this style\nof reproduction isn\u2019t the norm for hydrozoan jellyfish, it\u2019s not rare, either;\nat least 50 species worldwide are known to sprout clones from one body part or\nanother.\n\nOne of the dominant groups among zooplankton, copepods\u2014tiny aquatic\ncrustaceans\u2014are also some of the most abundant multicellular animals on the\nplanet. Most marine copepods are free-living, and many spend their whole lives\nas plankton, but some species are symbiotic or parasitic on other organisms.\nThese females of the parasitic order Monstrilloida left their bottom-dwelling\nhosts to reproduce in the water column. Unlike many plankton that take a sink-\nor-swim approach to reproduction, they offer some parental care to their\nyoung. Clocking in at a mere two millimeters long\u2014smaller than a sesame\nseed\u2014the female in the first photo carries a clutch of bright green eggs that\nfill most of her body. She can afford to devote this much space to her future\nbabies because the adults don\u2019t feed so they don\u2019t need much of a gut.\nInstead, they\u2019re physiologically dedicated to creating the next generation of\n\u201clittle monsters\u201d (the etymology of Monstrilla, the first described genus of\nthis group). Once fertilized, the eggs shift outside the mother\u2019s body onto a\nlong trailing spine, as with the female in the second photo, where mucus holds\nthem in place until the baby copepods hatch as nauplii. The nauplii soon leave\nthe plankton community to invade a host and grow up as parasites until they\u2019re\nready to continue the cycle.\n\nIf this violet tunicate larva looks a bit like a frog tadpole, that\u2019s no\ncoincidence. Tunicates are chordates, animals that at some point in life have\na notochord\u2014a precursor to a backbone\u2014as well as a nerve cord. This makes them\ndistant relatives of humans. It\u2019s an unexpected connection, especially because\nadult tunicates are often colorful, gelatinous blobs. In vertebrates, the\nnotochord and nerve cord eventually become the spine and spinal cord, while in\ntunicates they disappear after this short-lived larval stage. After incubating\nfor a month inside one of its hermaphroditic parents, the violet tunicate\ntadpole emerges and stays in the water column for a day or two while it\nsearches for a suitable home to settle onto. Once it attaches head first to a\nsolid surface\u2014whether that\u2019s a pier, piling, or piece of seaweed\u2014the\nresemblance to its backbone-bearing relations is lost. It resorbs its tail as\nit transforms into its final form, then quickly gets to work eating and\nreplicating to build a labyrinthine colony.\n\nThis \u201cswimming helmet\u201d is the larva of a ribbon worm, an unsegmented marine\nworm with an impressive retractable proboscis it uses to stab prey. To\nreproduce, this group of worms\u2014also called nemerteans\u2014respond to chemical cues\nin the water and gather in mating balls for coordinated spawning. In some\nspecies, the fertilized eggs eventually develop into free-swimming larvae,\nsuch as this one, called the pilidium. During metamorphosis, a worm-like\njuvenile develops inside the pilidium. As the worm\u2019s planktonic stage comes to\nan end, the juvenile breaks out of its pilidium, devours its larval tissues,\nand heads to the seafloor to begin life as a benthic adult.\n\nTo reproduce, a male hermit crab deposits his sperm near a female\u2019s abdomen\njust after she\u2019s molted. The female will store the sperm until she has\nproduced clusters of several hundred eggs and until conditions are right for\nfertilization. She then broods the eggs, providing some level of protection.\n(Females can carry several broods a year.) Young hermit crabs hatch as zoeae,\nfirst photo. Long spines and fringed antennae help keep them afloat. A zoea\nwill go through about four molts to become a megalopa, second photo. The\njuvenile crabs are still tiny at this stage but more closely resemble the\nadults they\u2019ll become. Since the abdomens of hermit crabs aren\u2019t covered in a\nhard exoskeleton, the animals slip inside the spiral cavity of an empty snail\nshell for protection. If food or shells are scarce, hermit crabs will remain\nplanktonic longer before settling to the seafloor.\n\nLike their hermit crab relatives, true crabs start off as spiny-looking zoeae\nand then metamorphose into megalopae. During this relatively brief final\nlarval stage, crab megalopae are mostly planktonic and use their tail to help\nthemselves swim. But they will also tuck their tail against their abdomen\u2014as\nshown by this graceful decorator crab\u2014as they make occasional forays to the\nseafloor to flex their legs and walk in preparation for their fully benthic\nlife. This decorator megalopa will have to wait to test out its namesake\nskill, though. Adults of the species are among the most prolific decorators in\nthe northeast Pacific. They snip pieces of their environment, like algae and\nsponges, and adorn their bodies with this camouflaging material using\nspecialized hooked structures. But larvae aren\u2019t able to decorate until they\nsettle to the seafloor for good. As they morph into their juvenile form, they\ngain their hooks and immediately and thoroughly start to adorn themselves.\n\nThe ways in which polychaetes, commonly known as bristle worms, live their\nlives varies widely, and how they produce the next generation is no exception.\nThe adults of some seafloor-dwelling groups, for example, follow environmental\ncues, such as the stage of the moon, to partly or fully transform into a\nswimming version of themselves. For a short time, they become planktonic and\ngather en masse to spawn in surface waters. Some of these swarming swimmers\nsimply release their gametes near a mate and call it a night. Other species\ndevote more care to reproduction, such as this egg-laden female noble necklace\nworm that joined a spawning event to gather sperm. Once the eggs she holds in\nan external brood sac are fertilized, she will swim them back to the seafloor\nwhile they incubate. When it\u2019s time for the young to head off into the water\non their own, the mother makes a second appearance among the plankton to\nrelease her developed larvae.\n\nA hairy worm larva doesn\u2019t exactly sound cute, but baby polychaetes have their\ncharms. This particular grublike creature is a larval parchment tubeworm, a\ntype of polychaete that, as an adult, lives an inconspicuous existence in a\nlong, narrow tube it builds in the seafloor. But first, like other\npolychaetes, the parchment tubeworm starts out as an active blob called a\ntrochophore. Shaped like spinning tops, trochophores initially have few other\ndistinguishing features besides a head, eyes, and a band of cilia used for\nmovement. As they grow, these larvae start to develop body segments, gain\ntheir eponymous bristles, and form more distinguishing shapes\u2014such as this\none\u2019s huge mouth and bumblebee-shaped back end.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe plankton was collected and photographed by the Hakai Institute\u2019s\nBiomarathon Project team.
