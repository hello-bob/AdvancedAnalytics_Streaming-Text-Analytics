They did the bare minimum and moved on.\n\nA few years ago I tweeted about this \u201cbare minimum\u201d phenomenon where app\nmakers updated their icon for macOS Big Sur by taking their previous\nicon/logo, putting it on a white squircle, and calling it a day.\n\nThat always felt like a bit of a shame when compared to the alternative: take\nan opportunity to imagine a new expression of your brand/logo/icon in the\ncontext and constraints of macOS Big Sur\u2019s new icon template (i.e. the\nsquircle).\n\nFor example, here\u2019s a re-imagining of the Outlook icon (done by, as far as I\ncan tell, agraaaaao).\n\nIt\u2019s fun to see how folks take advantage of \u201cthe ever-so-subtle yet unique-to-\nmacOS opportunity\u201d to break outside of the outer edges of the squircle and\nprovide some dimensionality to their icons.\n\nAs a self-professed icon-noisseur, I love browsing through app icons that\npeople have re-imagined for their desktops \u2014 wresting control of the visual\nappearance of the app icon from its maker and appropriating it to themselves.\n\nFor example, as I browsed the wonderful macosicons.com gallery, I came across\nthese alternatives for Chrome (the original from Google is on the far left,\noutlined in yellow):\n\nI love seeing the character of Chrome bleed to the edges and fit the visual\nlanguage of its environment (macOS). More visually interesting than merely\ndropping the Chrome circle on a white background.\n\nIn a similar vein, here\u2019s Slack:\n\nAgain, more interesting to see some character infused into the icon (as\nopposed to just dropping it on a white background).\n\nWhere things get really interesting is when people explore breaking out of the\nsquircle (which you can do on macOS) to provide some dimension to their icon.\nFor example, here\u2019s Firefox:\n\nAnd there are some VSCode alternatives that explore both 1) going beyond a\nlogo on a white background, and 2) providing dimension while borrowing from\nthe visual language for Apple\u2019s native development tool (Xcode).\n\nMicrosoft is perhaps the biggest culprit of \u201cdrop it on a white background\u201d as\ntheir suite of office tools do precisely that \u2014 which makes it a fertile\nground for folks re-imagining what the family of office icons could be.\n\nFor example here\u2019s Outlook:\n\nAnd here\u2019s Excel:\n\nWord:\n\nAnd Powerpoint:\n\nJust a little visual fun/exploration for your day.
