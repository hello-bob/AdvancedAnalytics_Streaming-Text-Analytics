Put simply, air is forced\ninto the shower head's water stream through a small hole at the base of the\nhandle. When the water and air mix, this mixture spins around in the wand at\nhigh speed causing turbulence which increases the pressure inside the shower\nhead. This forces the water out of the shower head with all the power of a\nconventional shower head, but uses considerably less water. This is why we\nhave such a large customer base who use Ecocamel shower heads in the RVs and\nMotor Homes.\n\nshop now\n\nnew\n\n## Shower Evolution\n\nJetstorm shower head from Ecocamel offers a full-flow, spa-like shower in your\nRV or motor home by using the latest water and energy-saving technology.\n\nbuy now\n\ndiscover\n\n# The Orb Spa Range\n\nInnovative British Design with unbeatable performance.\n\nYou'll never use another shower head.\n\nShop Now\n\nDiscover\n\n# The Plantsurge Range\n\nHarness the power of magnets for healthier plants & crops\n\nShop Now\n\n## What's New\n\nby Ofir NeumanOct 19, 2022\n\n### This is how installing a water pressure increasing shower head, can change\nyour morning routine (suitable for electric showers too)\n\nSo you woke up just in time to have a quick shower and a snack before going to\nwork.
