Thankfully, the risk to the public is\nlow, but the more the virus spreads, the more chances it has to mutate and\njump species to spread among humans. Given H5N1\u2019s high mortality rate, we\ndon\u2019t want this to happen.\n\nThis outbreak is concerning; unfortunately, communication and data\ntransparency have been profoundly lacking. We must do better and faster \u2014\nrepeating the same communication mistakes that fueled confusion, distrust, and\nmisinformation during Covid-19 is inexcusable.\n\nHere\u2019s what we do and don\u2019t know about H5N1.\n\n> This post builds off previous YLE updates of the current cow outbreak. To\n> get up to speed, start here.\n\n####\n\nH5N1 continues to spread among animals\n\nH5N1 been detected among 33 dairy cattle herds in 8 states. The virus is\nspreading through multiple known pathways: wild bird \u2192 cow; cow \u2192 cow; cow \u2192\npoultry, and once from cow \u2192 human. Thankfully, there is currently no evidence\nof human-to-human transmission.\n\nHow big is the \u201ctrue\u201d outbreak? We don\u2019t know. Symptomatic testing of animals\nand humans is voluntary, and asymptomatic testing is not happening (likely due\nto industry pressure), which means we are flying blind. It\u2019s been reported\nthat more workers have symptoms \u2014 such as fever, cough, and lethargy \u2014 but are\nunwilling to test. We could have more human cases. Among the tests conducted,\nit\u2019s unclear how many have been done, how many were positive, and how many\nhumans have been exposed.\n\nTwo positive updates:\n\n  * There is a federal rule for moving cows now. As of yesterday, the federal government requires testing all lactating cows before moving across states. Finally! Unfortunately, it\u2019s likely too late to contain transmission.\n\n  * Pigs have been testing negative. This is good news. Pigs are dangerous hosts for H5N1 because they have avian and human receptors. They are known as \u201cmixing vessels\u201d for influenza viruses.\n\n####\n\nThe outbreak is much larger and started earlier than we thought.\n\nWe don\u2019t know how big the outbreak is from physically swabbing animals and\nhumans, but two clues suggest this has been spreading under our noses for a\nwhile:\n\n  1. Clue #1: The FDA found H5N1 fragments in the milk supply. This was surprising because milk from known infected cows was not going to the market. This confirms that the cow outbreak is bigger than previously known.\n\nThankfully, milk pasteurization should deactivate any bird flu that makes it\ninto the milk supply. Scientists confirmed this yesterday: they could not grow\nactive virus from the milk samples. This means the virus fragments detected in\nmilk were broken pieces that cannot replicate and, thus, cannot harm humans.\nThe FDA is testing more samples just in case. Thus far, the public has seen no\ndata.\n\n  2. Clue #2: Genomic surveillance can tell us how, where, and when H5N1 mutates. After being reluctant to share genetic data, USDA finally shared 239 viral sequences from animal infections. However, the data was incomplete\u2014the date and location of the sample collection were not included, making it difficult to answer key questions about how the virus has changed over time and, therefore, predict where it might end up.\n\nAlso, there was no mention of what USDA scientists found with this data\ninternally. We\u2019ve relied on scientists on social media to walk through what\nthey found after analyzing the raw data, which suggests an estimated spillover\nto dairy cows starting in December.\n\n####\n\nWastewater is spiking. Is it H5N1?\n\nSome on social media discovered wastewater spiking in some places with\ninfected herds. For example, in Amarillo, Texas, wastewater is skyrocketing\nfor flu A while the rest of the state remains low.\n\nCould this be H5N1? Yes, but we don\u2019t know for sure; the government has not\nofficially shared anything about wastewater. This is incredibly disappointing,\ngiven this is the perfect use case for wastewater monitoring.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t have a wastewater test for H5N1 yet, it has many similarities\nto flu strain A. Some wastewater systems include human wastewater and\nstormwater. Given that Amarillo has stockyards, this strengthens the\npossibility that it\u2019s H5N1, especially since we aren\u2019t seeing it in other\nparts of the state. The most likely scenario? The spike is from milk dumping\nor animal sewage. We need more data.\n\n####\n\nThe tools work, but...\n\nThe U.S. government has confirmed that Tamiflu and the stockpiled H5N1\nvaccines are predicted to have efficacy if this does move to humans. This is\ngreat news. And I agree there shouldn\u2019t be panic. But I caution leaders\nagainst the \u201cwe\u2019re fine, we have vaccines\u201d attitude.\n\n  * What about manufacturing and supply?\n\n  * What about the rest of the globe?\n\n  * What about vaccine hesitancy?\n\n  * And decline in trust?\n\n  * And access problems?\n\nOf course, fully relying on vaccines and overconfidence were among the big\nmistakes of the Covid-19 emergency. As one of our colleagues wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s best\nto face these threats with humility and determination.\u201d\n\n####\n\nA communication void will be filled with confusion, mistrust, and\nmisinformation\n\nInformation from the response has not been easy to find, has not been\ncomplete, and has not been backed with data, leaving many of us to piece\ntogether a fuzzy picture.\n\nThis is a big problem for many reasons:\n\n  1. Misinformation brews in information voids. People, rightfully so, have questions and can\u2019t find answers.\n\n  2. Trusted messengers don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. During an outbreak, top-down, credible, and consistent communication is necessary. Equally important is actively equipping trusted messengers\u2014mass media, scientists, physicians, and community leaders\u2014so they can communicate from the bottom up.\n\n  3. Tools could be at risk. For example, wastewater surveillance is one of the only tools that wasn\u2019t weaponized during Covid-19 emergency. My biggest concern is that if we aren\u2019t transparent\u2014walking the public through what we are and are not doing with wastewater\u2014people will become hesitant about this surveillance.\n\n  4. Chips away at credibility. Although brilliant scientists are within each agency, their expertise isn\u2019t shining through.\n\n  5. Harming global capacity to respond. This is an emerging global pandemic threat. Other countries need to know, for example, if they should start testing their cows. If they should be looking for mutations, and where.\n\nWe need a coordinated response from our government. Yes, there are multiple\nplayers involved. And yes, they have their own priorities, legal authorities,\nagility, experience, and politics. However, honest, frequent, direct\ncommunication earns the public\u2019s trust and confidence. If not, communities are\nstarved for good information during outbreaks or emergencies, leading to\nunnecessary anxiety, confusion, and frustration.\n\nAfter much pressure, government agencies finally hosted a live briefing for\nthe media yesterday. This is a positive step in the right direction and, I\nhope, a sign that the winds are changing.\n\n####\n\nBottom line\n\nResponses need to get better faster. H5N1 is a dangerous disease that can\naffect our economy, food security, and animal and human health. This response\nhas been incredibly difficult to watch on the heels of Covid-19 (and mpox and\nother emergencies like the East Palestine train accident). We get just so many\n\u201cpractice runs\u201d before it starts costing lives again.\n\nLove, YLE and Dr. P\n\n\u201cYour Local Epidemiologist (YLE)\u201d is written and founded by Dr. Katelyn\nJetelina, M.P.H.
