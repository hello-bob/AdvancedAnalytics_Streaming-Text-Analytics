Grab a hot beverage (\u2615)\n  2. Pick an algorithm (\ud83d\udc48)\n  3. Start coding (\u2764\ufe0f)\n\nCan\u2019t choose? Try: Simulated Annealing, or Genetic Algorithm, or Particle\nSwarm.\n\nIf you get stuck, see the help section.\n\n## Praise #\n\nRead more praise\n\n## Algorithms #\n\nHi I\u2019m Jason Brownlee and I\u2019m an algorithm geek like you. Learn more.\n\nAlgorithms are listed in the table of contents (left) and are roughly grouped\nby type.\n\nI included mostly stochastic optimization algorithms drawn from across\nsubfields of computer science, such as: computational intelligence and\nmetaheuristics. You could call them machine learning (ML) or artificial\nintelligence (AI) algorithms if you like.\n\n## Code #\n\nWhy not share your code with fellow algorithm lovers?\n\n  * Save all of your algorithm code in a public repository, e.g. on github or gitlab.\n  * Share a link to your code with me: complete my \u201cshare your code\u201d form.\n  * Share a link to your code with algorithm loving communities on twitter, reddit, and linkedin.\n\nIf there\u2019s interest, I may set up code page, comments, forum, etc.\nCollaboration with fellow algorithm geeks might be even more fun!\n\n## Mini-Books #\n\nAs requested, you can now explore algorithm mini-books, e.g.:\n\n", "frontpage": false}
