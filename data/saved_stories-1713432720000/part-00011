To mark the\nday, a Surya Tilak of the deity took place, using an apparatus with mirrors\nand lenses designed by IIT engineers. A number of ancient Indian temples,\nhowever, are designed for Suryabhishek on specific days.\n\nListen to Story\n\nLive TV\n\nShare\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Sun's rays fell on the forehead of Ram Lalla in the form of a 'surya\ntilak' at the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya on the occassion of Ram Navami.\n\nSushim Mukul\n\nNew Delhi,UPDATED: Apr 17, 2024 16:51 IST\n\nThis is Ram Lalla's first Ram Navami at his newly built home, the Ram Mandir\nin Ayodhya. Something special took place on this special occasion. The Sun\nkissed the deity's forehead in a ritual known as Surya Abhishek or Surya\nTilak.\n\nRam Navami is on April 17 this year.\n\nDuring the ritual, the sun's rays were focused on Ram Lalla's forehead as a\nSurya Tilak. It is also significant because Lord Ram is from the Ishvaku clan,\nbelieved to be the descendents of the Sun, or Suryavanshis.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, (IIT-R) and the Indian Institute\nof Astrophysics collaborated on the project to design the Surya Tilak\nmechanism.\n\n### WHAT IS SURYA TILAK OR SURYA ABHISHEK?\n\nThe term Surya Abhishek is derived from Surya (sun) and abhishek (a ritual).\n\nSurya Abhishek is actually a mix of optics and mechanics at play, where the\nsun's rays are made to fall on the deity's forehead, as a symbol of reverence.\n\nThe same mechanism has been used in the Ram temple, but the engineering is a\nbit different.\n\nHowever, the practice of Surya Abhishek using mechanics is not new and has\nbeen essential to the ancient temples of the Indian subcontinent.\n\n### SURYABHISHEK AT AYODHYA RAM MANDIR ON RAM NAVAMI\n\nAt precisely 12:01, the sun's rays lit up the forehead of Ram Lalla, seated in\nthe sanctum of Ram Mandir, for around two to two-and-a-half minutes.\n\nThe sunlight illuminating Ram Lalla's forehead created a 'Surya Tilak'.\n\nThe Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust, responsible for the Ram Temple's\nmanagement, had been working for these moments well in advance to ensure the\nproject's success.\n\nScientists from the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee (IIT-R) and the\nIndian Institute of Astrophysics, an autonomous body under the Department of\nScience & Technology, were roped in to design the Surya Tilak mechanism.\n\nTwo trials of the Surya Abhishek were done before the ceremony on Ram Navami,\nwith the team of scientists employing an apparatus with high-quality mirrors\nand lenses to precisely direct the sun's rays onto Ram Lalla's forehead at a\nspecific time.\n\nThe apparatus, according to reports, is a gearbox arranged with reflective\nmirrors and lenses. It helped sunrays from the third floor near the shikara to\nbe reflected into the garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum) precisely at 12.01 pm.\n\nModel of the 'Surya Tilak apparatus'.\n\nThe tilak apparatus used components made of brass and bronze materials for\ntheir durability and corrosion resistance. Based on the lunar calendar, the\ngearbox has been engineered to accurately position the sun on Ram Navami day\neach year.\n\nThe optical path, pipings, and tip-tilts are designed without springs for\nlongevity and low maintenance.\n\nThe apparatus has been developed in collaboration with Bengaluru-based Optics\n& Allied Engineering.\n\nadvertisement\n\nPancha Dhathu, a traditional Indian alloy, has also been used in the surya\ntilak apparatus.\n\nFormer ISRO scientist, Manish Purohit explained the mechanism behind the Surya\nAbhishek and said three things have been considered while ensuring the Sun's\nrays illuminate Ram Lalla's forehead. These three things are --\narchaeoastronomy, metonic cycle and analemma.\n\nArchaeoastronomy is a practice used to design monuments utilising celestial\npositions, said the scientist. Another phenomenon that has been kept in mind\nfor the Surya Tilak is analemma, which is a figure-eight curve that tracks the\nSun's changing position yearly due to Earth's tilt and orbit.\n\nLastly, the Metonic cycle is a period of around 19 years during which the\nphases of the Moon realign with the same days of the year. This cycle was\nconsulted to ensure the coming together of the date of Ram Navami and the\n'tithi' it falls on, said Manish Purohit.\n\n### THE ANCIENT SCIENCE OF SURYABHISHEK\n\nWhile the Surya Abhishek in Ayodhya uses lenses and mirrors to guide the Sun's\nrays onto Ram Lalla's forehead, ancient Indian temples traditionally\nincorporated astronomically calculated openings in and around the garbhagriha\n(sanctum sanctorum) to allow sunlight to directly illuminate the deity on\nspecific days, combining tradition with technology.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe ritual and scope of Surya Abhishek has been a norm in several Jain temples\nand Hindu sun temples across India.\n\nSuriyanar Kovil temple, Tamil Nadu: One of the most prominent temples where\nSuryabhishek is performed is the Suriyanar Kovil temple. The temple from the\n11-12th century dedicated to Surya is known for its unique blend of\narchitectural and astronomical know-hows.\n\nThe temple is designed in such a way that sunlight aligns with specific points\nin the temple during certain times of the year, illuminating the deity,\nSuriyanar (Sun) and his consorts Ushadevi and Pratyusha Devi.\n\nNanarayanaswamy Temple, Andhra Pradesh: In Nagalapuram district, the\nNanarayanaswamy Temple hosts a five-day Surya Puja Mahotsavam, during which\nthe Sun's rays penetrate the temple and transition through phases each day.\n\nIn the five days, the Sun's rays move from the feet to the navel of the\npresiding deity in the garbhagriha, which is the 'Matsya avatar' (fish) of\nLord Vishnu.\n\nMahalakshmi Temple, Maharashtra: The Chalukyan Mahalakshmi Temple in Kolhapur\nis known for its Kiranotsav, which is a bi-annual event.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe rare Kiranotsav event (festival of sunray) occurs when the sun's rays\ndirectly fall on the deity's idol in the temple through the Garud Mandap to\nreach the garbhagriha.\n\nWhile the Sun's rays fall on the feet of the goddess Mahalaxmi twice a year\nand on the central part of the idol also on two days.\n\nOn two specific days, the sunlight bathes the entire idol.\n\nKoba Jain Temple, Gujarat: Surya Tilak is also seen annually in the Koba Jain\nTemple in Ahmedabad, when the Sun's rays fall directly on the forehead of the\nmarble statue of the deity, Mahaveerswami, at exactly 2.07pm for three\nminutes.\n\nThe annual event at Koba is a spectacle and is attended by lakhs of Jains\naround the globe, says Jain Treasures, a website on Jain pilgrimage worldwide.\n\nUnav Balaji Surya Temple, Madhya Pradesh: The Unav Balaji Surya Temple in\nMadhya Pradesh's Datia also hosts a festival dedicated to its deity, the Sun\nGod, when the first rays of the Sun at dawn falls directly on the idol in the\nsanctum sanctorum of the temple.\n\nModhera Sun Temple, Gujarat: The Modhera Sun Temple, dating back to the 11th\ncentury, also sees a similar unique phenomenon where sunrays enter the temple\nand fall on the idol of the Sun God two specific days a year.\n\nKonark Sun Temple, Odisha: Among the most renowned Sun temples is the one at\nOdisha's Konark. The 13th-century temple, dedicated to the Sun God, is known\nfor the way sunlight bathed the temple, particularly at sunrise. The design\nensured that the first rays of the Sun touch the temple's main entrance, then\nfilter through its different doorways, casting light upon the garbhagriha\nwithin.\n\nHowever, due to ongoing conservation, the doors leading to the garbhagriha and\nthe main deity at the Konark Sun Temple are closed to the public.\n\nRanakpur Jain Temples, Rajasthan: Nestled in the Aravalis is the 15th-century\nRanakpur Temple. The white marble marvel was designed in a way to make way for\nsunlight to enter its interior, casting a radiant glow on the Jain temple's\ninner sanctum.\n\nThe architecture also allows the Sun's rays to cascade directly onto the idol\nof the Sun god.\n\nGavi Gangadhareshwara Temple, Karnataka: The Gavi Gangadhareshwara Temple,\nalso known as the Gavipuram Cave Temple, near Bengaluru, is dedicated to Lord\nShiva. Every year on Makar Sankranti, the Sun's rays illuminate the statue of\nNandi first, then reaches the feet of the Shivlingam, and finally, then covers\nthe entire deity.\n\nCarved from a particular type of rock, the garbhagriba enables direct sunlight\nto penetrate its otherwise dark cave interior.\n\nSurya Abhishek, apart from in these temples, can also be seen in Tamil Nadu's\nAvudaiyar Koil Temple, Nageswaram Temple, Khajuraho's Viswanath Temple and\nSringeri's Saradamba Temple, among others.\n\nMillions watched the pran pratishtha ceremony of the Ram Lalla idol on January\n22. The Surya Abhishek on April 17 was another moment when people from across\nthe world witnessed the Sun's rays kiss the forehead of Ram Lalla. This was\nthe moment when sunlight took both tradition and science into its warm\nembrace.\n\n(This report has been updated after the Surya Tilak ceremony)\n\nPublished By:\n\nSushim Mukul\n\nPublished On:\n\nApr 16, 2024\n\nMust Watch\n\nWatch Live TV\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Also Watch\n\n0:36\n\n### Will do what party will decide: Rahul Gandhi on contesting from Amethi\n\n2:05\n\n### Surya Tilak: Watch spectacular moment sun rays adorned Ram Lalla\u2019s\nforehead\n\n27:47\n\n### Was a temple razed in Ayodhya?
