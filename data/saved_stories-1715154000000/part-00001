It may be the\nmost dangerous Internet bill you\u2019ve never heard of since it contemplates\nmeasures that raise privacy concerns, website blocking, and extend far beyond\npornography sites to include search and social media. The bill started in the\nSenate and is now in the House of Commons, where last year Conservative, NDP,\nand Bloc MPs voted alongside a small number of Liberal MPs in favour of it at\nsecond reading and sent it to committee for further study. The government has\ncalled the bill \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d, but there may be sufficient House\nsupport to turn it into binding legislation.\n\nWhile Senator Miville-Dech\u00eane emphasizes stopping underage access to sexually\nexplicit material and her view that that goal merits site blocking and\nmandated age verification even for some uses of Google and Twitter, a new\nstandards initiative suggests that some envision far more extensive use of\nmandated age verification systems. The Digital Governance Council is one of\nseveral Jim Balsillie-led organizations focused on influencing government\ndigital and innovation policy. Its CEO is Keith Jansa, who Senator Miville-\nDech\u00eane identified in the Law Bytes podcast as her source for providing\nassurance of the privacy safeguards in the bill.\n\nThe DGC includes an accredited standard-setting arm which is now promoting the\ndevelopment of a standard for age verification which \u201caims to foster the\nwidespread adoption of age-verification technologies in Canada.\u201d The proposal\nfor the standard makes it clear that Bill S-210 is only the start. In fact, it\nargues that recent trends \u201ccompel the need for a broader application of age\nverification technologies\u201d than those envisioned by the bill. In doing so, it\ncites the need for age verification technologies for gaming platforms, live\nstreaming video, virtual reality, online advertising, and chat forums. With\nregard to Bill S-210, the proposal maintains that support for age verification\nshould extend far more broadly:\n\n> The proposed standard is crucial as Bill S-210 progresses through Parliament\n> as it will define best practices in the fields of age verification and\n> privacy protection to support the legislation when age-verification methods\n> are prescribed. The need is also evident for industry and consumers\n> considering continuous usage of age-verification dependent products.\n\nThe goal of the standard is therefore explicitly to expand the use of age\nverification:\n\n> This proposed standard aims to:\n>\n> a. Facilitate the adoption of age-verification technologies in Canada,\n>\n> b. Support the Canadian industry by establishing defined standards for age\n> verification,\n>\n> c. Encourage biometrics-based age-verification innovation by Canadian\n> researchers, and\n>\n> d. Ensure compatibility of Canadian regulations on age-verification with\n> international standards.\n\nAge verification may indeed be a useful tool, but the Australian government\nrecently concluded that the technology is \u201cimmature, and present privacy,\nsecurity, implementation and enforcement risks.\u201d Despite those risks, Bill\nS-210 has advanced rapidly through the Parliamentary process and we now learn\nthat a leading technology business lobby group is rushing to establish a\nstandard with the express goal of fostering its widespread adoption in Canada,\nwhile at the same time providing behind-the-scenes advice on the privacy\nimplications of Bill S-210. If you thought that bill was dangerous before, the\nwork of the DGC suggests that the industry envisions a future with widespread\nuse of mandated age verification technologies for accessing sites and services\non the Internet.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)\n  * More\n\n  * Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to print (Opens in new window)\n\n### Related posts:\n\nThe Most Dangerous Canadian Internet Bill You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Is a Step\nCloser to Becoming Law Site Blocking and Age Verification for Twitter,\nInstagram, Snap and Twitch?: Age Verification Lobby Confirms it Wants Bill\nS-210 to Cover All Social Media Sites The Law Bytes Podcast, Episode 190:\nDebating Bill S-210 \u2013 Senator Julie Miville-Dech\u00eane Defends Her Internet Age\nVerification Bill\n\nTags: age verification / balsillie / digital governance council / Miville-\nDech\u00eane / privacy / s-210 / standards\n\n### Share this post\n\n### 22 Comments\n\n  1.

How will age verification be done for a Canadian\nwho is 22 years old, and has neither a credit card nor a government ID? If\nthere is no solution for that group, then age verification is guaranteed to\nprevent legitimate access.\n\nThe solution here is to enable parents to make local blocking settings on\ndevices. Parents are the best method of age verification for minors.\n\nReply\n\n  3. Julia says:\n\nJanuary 31, 2024 at 10:46 am\n\nEarn $300 each hour.

Much effort has been put into trying to do so, with remarkably little\nsuccess against current techniques for defeating the captcha. It\u2019s not\ncompletely one-sided but it seems to me the bots are generally winning that\nfight lately.\n\nWhat fantasy world are these people living in to make them believe that there\nexists some kind of magic we can use to reliably detect the age of every user\nwithout severely intrusive data collection, or even with it? I look forward to\nfinding out, haven\u2019t listened to the podcast yet.\n\nReply\n\n     * Brian says:\n\nJanuary 31, 2024 at 12:52 pm\n\nThey don\u2019t believe there is any such magic.

Just look at the things people\nwill do in order to cheat in video games\n(https://yewtu.be/watch?v=RwzIq04vd0M) and imagine that level of effort\ndevoted to defeating biometric age-verification software. The only reason age-\ndetection bypass software isn\u2019t commonly available already is because nobody\nuses biometric age verification for anything important, and that is because\nnobody wants it and it sucks.\n\nSo they only way they can sell that product is to dupe the politicians, but\neven then it\u2019s set up to fail. It will inevitably need further legal\nreinforcement in the form of criminalization of the software tools that can be\nused to defeat the age divination magic. The whole project then obviously\nbecomes part of the \u201cwar on general-purpose computing.\u201d Perhaps that explains\nwhy Microsoft isn\u2019t as strictly opposed to the idea as they might be if they\nweren\u2019t desperate to find some way to lock out future competition from less\nuser-hostile operating systems.\n\nReply\n\n  7. shan says:\n\nJanuary 31, 2024 at 9:40 pm\n\nWell I listened to the interview.

Meanwhile\nshe repeatedly says it\u2019s about \u201cprotecting the children\u201d while the text of the\nbill aims at not just children but everyone under the age of 18 years.\n\nOne point that I don\u2019t remember being made about the kind of \u201cfilters\u201d that\ncan be controlled by parents is that they could be made much more effective\nand easy to use if governments were to mandate that porn websites (and\neveryone else providing material not suitable for children in various ways)\nmust follow a specific standard for identifying that content, or that their\nsite allows such content. If Canada attempted to lead the way in that\ndirection it might actually do the world some good.\n\nReply\n\n     * Kevin says:\n\nFebruary 1, 2024 at 8:31 am\n\nBut filters would be the simplest way to do the job...

Chris S says:\n\nFebruary 1, 2024 at 10:45 am\n\nKnowing something about web technology is important here.\n\nEspecially ... DoH, AnyCast, ESNI.\n\nDoH means that your ISP will not know what websites you might visit because\nthe domain name queries and replies will be encrypted.\n\nAnyCast is a CloudFlare technology that essentially means a website can be\nreached through hundreds \u2013 or more \u2013 IP address. In IPv6, CloudFlare has 10^30\nIP addresses.\n\nESNI is the \u201cEncrypted Server Name Indication\u201d is how your browser will\nspecify the website requested, and how the server will know that \u2013 but no\nlayer in between can know what website is being reached.\n\nThe overall result is that your ISP is completely blind to your website\ntraffic, and cannot block a particular website without blocking thousands of\nother sites as well.\n\nNow \u2013 this legislation might be capable of forcing Canadian sites to implement\nsomething. But the net effect is to disadvantage Canadian web sites and site\nhosting. Just move the business to a non-Canadian location, or sell to a non-\nCanadian company, and carry on as usual.\n\nThis legislation *threatens* Canadian companies, rather than helps them.\n\nReply\n\n     * Brian says:\n\nFebruary 1, 2024 at 12:07 pm\n\n> The overall result is that your ISP is completely blind to your website\n> traffic, and cannot block a particular website without blocking thousands of\n> other sites as well.\n\nThat is expressly permitted in the Bill! To be perfectly clear, the proponents\nunderstand the risk of overly-broad blocking and the collateral damage it\nwould cause, and they are OK with it. You have to be willing to do that if you\nwant to save the children after-all!\n\n> Now \u2013 this legislation might be capable of forcing Canadian sites to\n> implement something. But the net effect is to disadvantage Canadian web\n> sites and site hosting. Just move the business to a non-Canadian location,\n> or sell to a non-Canadian company, and carry on as usual.\n\nThis proposal is not limited to just Canadian websites. It proposes to be\nglobal and force the entire world to age verify all Canadians. Any website\noutside of the legal reach of the Canadian government that does not implement\nwill be blocked as above, along with all of the collateral damage that may\ncause. Again, somebody needs to think of the children!\n\n> This legislation *threatens* Canadian companies, rather than helps them.\n\nYou need to be specific here. This legislation threatens some Canadian\ncompanies, indeed. But it massively benefits the Age Verification industry,\nwhich is obviously the puppet master behind all of this that has their hand up\nthe ass of the puppet Senator that is pushing for all of this.\n\nI\u2019m just waiting for the \u201canti-children\u201d propaganda to start over all of this.\nI.e. \u201cif you are against age verification then you must be a child-molesting\nsexual predator\u201d kind of bullshit.\n\nReply\n\n       * Chris S says:\n\nFebruary 2, 2024 at 4:07 pm\n\n\u201c[Overblocking] is expressly permitted in the Bill!\u201d\n\nThat is certainly true. But I suspect the thinking was more along the lines of\n\u201c60% of a site instead of 10%\u201d or \u201cthree sites not just the one\u201d. The *scale*\nof overblocking would be much greater than that, if it worked at all. I would\nbe interested in an answer to \u201cwill blocking still be used if it requires also\nblocking 1000 other websites\u201d. (I also think the answer would be dodged.)\n\n\u201cThis proposal is not limited to just Canadian websites.\u201d A nice claim there.\nAnd although (ineffective?) blocking might be aimed at sites outside Canada,\nthe fines can only really be levied against Canadian sites. And \u2013 like a\nnumber of other recent bills \u2013 this one might trigger a trade complaint,\nespecially if the complaining site or company was blocked by side effect.\n\n\u201cYou need to be specific here.\u201d Okay. First, this raises the risk of hosting a\nsite in Canada. The solution is to host *outside* Canada, where you can better\nmitigate the effects of blocking. That drives down the demand for hosting in\nCanada \u2013 and since the costs of hosting are strongly dependent on scale,\nreduced hosting puts upward pressure on hosting pricing for those still here,\nmaking it more likely to just go beyond borders to get a price break \u2013 a nasty\nspiral. Second, this raises the risk to a Canadian company owning and\noperating a site in Canada. If the company might be subject to fines (user\ngenerated content?) it may be less risky to move the ownership to a non-\nCanadian jurisdiction, and carry on business as usual (see \u201cFacebook Canadian\nnews content\u201d to see what happens when you try and strong-arm non-Canadian\ncompanies).\n\nThere are *already* reasonable solutions here to protect children. Not\nlegislation, but information and education for parents, which could be put to\nimmediate effective use \u2013 certainly sooner than it will take for this bill to\nget going. I find it completely bizarre that it appears to be the same\npolitically active groups that support parents\u2019 rights to raise their childing\nas they see fit using school policy, but prefer having the government take\nover from parents in this case. And, yes \u2013 that might be a politically useful\ntalking point: Why don\u2019t you directly help parents, instead of having the\ngovernment take over from them?\n\nReply\n\n         * Kevin says:\n\nFebruary 6, 2024 at 6:00 pm\n\nChris, I am not sure I agree with your statement about the parents rights\nsupport... I looked at the result of the vote in the HoC held on 13 Dec 2023,\nand the vote went mostly along party lines, with the following vote counts per\nparty:\n\nParty Yea Nay Paired LPC 15 132 1 CPC 115 0 1 BQ 32 0 0 NDP 24 0 0 Independent\n2 1 0 Green 1 0 0\n\nSo while most of the 189 Yea votes came from the CPC, it appeared to be more\nrelated to the party rather than the tendency to be libertarian.\n\nReply\n\n           * Chris S says:\n\nFebruary 8, 2024 at 11:34 am\n\nFirst \u2013 big congrats for actually looking up details. That is not done enough\nthese days!\n\nFor the S-210 vote, I agree \u2013 the data very much indicates a party-line vote\nfor the CPC, BQ, and NDP. That noted, I was rather thinking the other\ndirection \u2013 how is it that more members did not vote Nay, this being very much\na \u201cgovernment knows better than you\u201d type bill.\n\nThat topic risks starting me on that ongoing concern, that we actually might\nhave members with good judgement, but they are not permitted to exercise it,\nand instead have to quietly vote the party line, rather than vote their\njudgement and conscience. But that is very much a different topic.\n\n           * Kevin says:\n\nFebruary 8, 2024 at 6:08 pm\n\nChris, I just looked up an item from CTV news (from Dec 14) which indicated:\n\n\u201cA spokesperson for the Canadian heritage minister told The Canadian Press\nearlier this year that the government was working on its own approach to\ndealing with online harms, and the Senate bill overlapped with their work.\u201d\n\nSo it could be viewed that the LPC ordered members to vote against S-210 (in\nparticular the Cabinet members), and 15 didn\u2019t toe the line (the vote was\nsimply to send it to the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National\nSecurity for examination, not necessarily to pass it). The real test will be\nthird reading.\n\nIf the Senate bill were adopted it would steal the thunder of the upcoming\ngovernment bill, which could also explain why the CPC voted for it in second\nreading, not because they necessarily agree but to embarrass the government.\n\n  9.
