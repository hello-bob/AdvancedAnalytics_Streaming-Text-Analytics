The surface of the hat shall\n> be imprinted with stars and lightning bolts. Additionally, a psychologist or\n> psychiatrist shall be required to don a white beard that is not less than 18\n> inches in length and shall punctuate crucial elements of his testimony by\n> stabbing the air with a wand. Whenever a psychologist or psychiatrist\n> provides expert testimony regarding a defendant\u2019s competency, the bailiff\n> shall contemporaneously dim the courtroom lights and administer two strikes\n> to a Chinese gong.\n\nThe measure had received unanimous approval in the senate and was headed for\nthe house of representatives when sponsor Duncan Scott explained that he\u2019d\nintended it as satire \u2014 he felt that too many mental health practitioners had\nbeen acting as expert witnesses. It was withdrawn and never signed into law.\n\nApril 19, 2024April 18, 2024 | Oddities\n\n# Explore\n\nRandom Post\n\n# Archives\n\n# Categories\n\n  * Art\n  * Crime\n  * Death\n  * Entertainment\n  * History\n  * Hoaxes\n  * Humor\n  * Language\n  * Literature\n  * Oddities\n  * Podcast\n  * Poems\n  * Puzzles\n  * Quotations\n  * Religion\n  * Science & Math\n  * Society\n  * Technology\n  * Trivia\n  * Uncategorized\n\n# Follow\n\n# Subscribe by Email\n\n# Site Admin\n\n  * Log in\n\n# Info\n\n  * About Futility Closet\n  * Podcast\n  * Books\n  * Store\n  * Chess notation\n  * Contact/Submissions\n\n# ABOUT\n\nFutility Closet is a collection of entertaining curiosities in history,\nliterature, language, art, philosophy, and mathematics, designed to help you\nwaste time as enjoyably as possible.\n\nYou can read Futility Closet on the web, subscribe by RSS, or sign up to\nreceive a free daily email \u2014 see \u201cSubscribe by Email\u201d in the sidebar.\n\n# CREDITS\n\n\u00a9 Futility Closet 2005-2024\n\n", "frontpage": true}
