In 2021, more than 900,000 users\n> downloaded the app through Google Play, in Spain alone. This application has\n> its own website (www.newplay.site) and has various profiles on social\n> networks and communication channels: Telegram (+17k members); Twitch (+2,000\n> followers); Instagram (+29.2k followers); YouTube (23k subscribers). Through\n> these, the use of the app is promoted. As can be seen in the attached\n> evidence, through this application users can access various audiovisual\n> content such as sports, TV channels, series, movies, etc.\n\nThat the description above offered plenty of facts and figures for everything\nexcept the alleged infringement, which only gets a line of attention right at\nthe end, isn\u2019t exactly typical of these kinds of submissions. The evidence\namounted to a screenshot of a video of the app on YouTube, showing icons for\nvarious TV channels, two of which appeared to relate to LaLiga.\n\nCrucially, there were no claims that the app arrives in the hands of users\nalready configured to supply LaLiga match streams, nor was there any mention\nthat the app requires users to supply their own M3U playlists. However, there\nwas a screenshot of a comment made by a user querying an in-app message (\u201cIt\nasks me to enter a URL, what do I have to do?\u201d) and two responses.\n\nOne response appeared to be from someone affiliated with Newplay, who wrote:\n\u201cYou have to add or create a channel list.\u201d The other response linked to a URL\nwhere a playlist could be obtained. If that playlist had been posted by\nsomeone working for Newplay, that could\u2019ve caused problems. There are no signs\nthat was the case though; in isolation it only adds weight to the claim that\nno channels were provided in the app.\n\n## LaLiga Takes Complaint to Court\n\nIn the same month as the submission, April 2022, LaLiga walked away from a\nSpanish court (Juzgado de. Instrucci\u00f3n No 1 de Cieza) with an order that\ntargeted Newplay.\n\nThe order is referenced multiple times on the LaLiga website but no copy has\nbeen posted for public consumption and, thus far, we\u2019ve had no luck locating a\ncopy. The big question is whether the order was handed down after an\nadversarial procedure or one that relied purely on evidence supplied by\nLaLiga.\n\nWhat does seem clear, however, is that the order required various\nintermediaries to take action to undermine Newplay\u2019s ability to remain\nfunctional. Whether the companies took action before or after the order was\nhanded down isn\u2019t clear but Google, Apple, and Huawei acted similarly by\nremoving Newplay from their app stores.\n\nBut for LaLiga\u2019s top man, that wasn\u2019t enough. Last September, Javier Tebas\nrevealed that LaLiga had \u201celiminated\u201d 58 pirate apps, by unspecified means,\ntogether worth a million downloads in Spain. He said that having \u201celiminated\u201d\nthe apps, LaLiga wanted Google to \u2018locate\u2019 apps already downloaded onto users\nphones, so they too could be \u201celiminated\u201d. If the same can be done for child\nabuse images, then the same should apply to piracy tools, Tebas said.\n\nThere was no official response from Google, but it\u2019s not difficult to see why\nthe prospect of digging into users\u2019 phones, to remotely delete content, could\nbe problematic. The privacy implications alone could cause huge headaches, as\nLaLiga is well aware; a 250,000 euro fine for turning fans phones into piracy\nspying devices should\u2019ve been an instant reminder, logically at least.\n\n## Instead, LaLiga is doubling down\n\nAccording to an eLDiario.es report, LaLiga has now asked the investigating\njudge in the Newplay case to charge the local directors of Google, Apple, and\nHuawei, with \u201ca crime of serious disobedience.\u201d This relates to their alleged\nfailures to prevent users of their app ecosystems from continuing to use\ndownloaded copies of Newplay that still exist on their devices.\n\nIt\u2019s a crime that carries a sentence of up to a year in prison.\n\nIn these preliminary proceedings, Google, Apple, and Huawei as corporate\nentities also stand accused of the same \u201ccrime of serious disobedience.\u201d They\nalso stand accused of cooperating with Newplay\u2019s developer while profiting\nfrom his allegedly infringing, ad-supported activities.\n\n\u201cThe person under investigation used his \u2018simple\u2019 video player as a necessary\ninstrument for his clients to access the Television services he offered in\nexchange for a subscription or advertising, violating the rights of the\ncontent owners,\u201d LaLiga informed the court, as recalled by elDiario.es.\n\nIn addition to removing the app from their stores, the order required Google,\nApple, and Huawei to \u201cprevent users\u201d who had downloaded app from \u201caccessing\nthe application.\u201d It further ordered them to \u201cimmediately cease payment of\ncommissions\u201d derived from Newplay\u2019s paid version (without ads) and make\navailable to the court \u201cthe amounts that may be pending delivery\u201d to the\nNewplay developer.\n\nAccording to LaLiga, the companies haven\u2019t complied in either respect. All\nthree refused to comment for legal reasons.\n\nAs reported this weekend, the app Smart IPTV was blocked by ISPs in Spain\nrecently. In common with Newplay, Smart IPTV is also an .M3U player and comes\nwith no infringing content or links.\n\n  * Previous Post\n\n### Tagged In:\n\n  * App Store\n  * apple\n  * google\n  * Google Play\n  * LaLiga\n  * newplay\n\n### You Might Also Like:\n\nAnti-Piracy\n\n### \u2018Smart IPTV\u2019 App Blocked By ISPs, Despite it Carrying Zero Illegal Streams\n\n  * April 20, 2024, 09:28 by Andy Maxwell\n\nAnti-Piracy\n\n### Google Delisted Thousands of \u2018Music Piracy\u2019 Domains in Response to UK\nBlocking Orders\n\n  * April 12, 2024, 11:50 by Ernesto Van der Sar\n\nLawsuits\n\n### DoodStream: Hollywood, Netflix, Amazon & Apple Sue \u201cRogue Cyberlocker\u201d\n\n  * March 22, 2024, 11:02 by Andy Maxwell\n\nSubmit a correction or tip.\n\n##### Sponsors\n\n##### Popular Posts\n\n  * #### Which VPN Providers Really Take Privacy Seriously?\n\n  * #### Iconic Torrent Site RARBG Shuts Down, All Content Releases Stop\n\n  * #### \u2018U.S. Authorities Seize Z-Library Domain Names\u2019\n\n  * #### House of The Dragon Season Finale Leaks Early on Pirate Sites\n\n  * #### US Court Orders Every ISP in the United States to Block Illegal Streaming Sites\n\n##### From 2 Years ago...\n\nElon Musk Suggests That Piracy is Appealing Once Again\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nElon Musk Suggests That Piracy is Appealing Once Again\n\nNordVPN Had Private Keys Stolen after Server Breach (Updated)\n\nHBO Demands Takedown of Game of Thrones Screenshots\n\n#### TorrentFreak Stats\n\n  * ### 14961\n\nBreaking news stories\n\n  * ### 179k\n\nSocial media followers\n\n  * ### 19.9k\n\nRSS subscribers\n\nCopyright \u00b7 Privacy Policy \u00b7 VPN Providers \u00b7 About TorrentFreak\n\n", "frontpage": false}
