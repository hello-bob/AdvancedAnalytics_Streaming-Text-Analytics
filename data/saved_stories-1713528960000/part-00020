Medicare Part A is one of two\nparts that make up Original Medicare, the traditional Medicare service the\nfederal government offers. The two parts of Original Medicare are Medicare\nPart A (hospital insurance) and Medicare Part B (medical insurance). Medicare\nPart A helps cover a range of hospital care and services for patients in an\nacute hospital setting, a skilled nursing facility, and sometimes a home\nsetting.\n\n## Enrolling in Medicare Part A\n\nIf you are already collecting Social Security benefits or Railroad Retirement\nBoard benefits at age 65, you are automatically enrolled in Medicare Part A at\nno additional cost. If this applies to you, then three months before your 65th\nbirthday, your Medicare card will arrive by mail. If you aren\u2019t yet collecting\nthese benefits, you can enroll in Medicare during the open enrollment period\nin the three months before turning 65.\n\n### Here\u2019s a video on Medicare Part A in 2024.\n\nYou\u2019re eligible to join Medicare Part A in the following cases:\n\n  * You are at least 65 years old, or if you are younger, you fulfill the requirements because of a handicap or another unusual situation.\n  * You have resided in the country lawfully for at least five years and are a citizen or legal resident.\n\nKeep these details regarding the \u201cage 65\u201d restriction in mind, in case you\nwant to apply,\n\n  * You must wait until you are 65 years old, even if you are now receiving Social Security.\n  * You have to be 65. The age of your partner has no influence.\n  * You are qualified at age 65, even if you are not currently receiving Social Security benefits.\n\nIf you receive Social Security benefits once you turn 65, Medicare Parts A and\nB should automatically be added to your coverage. Contact the Social Security\noffice in your area if you think there is a problem.\n\n###\n\nDownload Chart\n\nHospital inpatient stays, skilled nursing facilities, hospice care, and a few\nhome health services are all covered by Medicare Part A.\n\nLet\u2019s learn about these factors in more detail.\n\n### Inpatient Hospital Care:\n\nIt covers your stay in a hospital that accepts Medicare in Part A. It also\ncovers any diagnostic procedures or medical care you require after being taken\nto the hospital.\n\nTo treat an injury or disease, a doctor must certify that hospitalization is\nrequired, and the facility must recognize Medicare.\n\nSemi-private rooms, general nursing, drug treatment, food, hospital services,\nand supplies are all included in hospital services or providers. Your doctor\nmight recommend services that Medicare doesn\u2019t cover; in this situation, you\nwill have to pay additional charges for Medicare. Furthermore, every private-\nduty nurse or private room will incur additional fees unless medically\nessential.\n\n### Hospital Stay (Longer than 60 days):\n\nYou will get this kind of coverage if a doctor formally admits you to a\nhospital for drug plan health. Besides the 60 lifetime reserve days, you are\ncovered for up to 90 days throughout each benefit term in a general hospital.\nIn addition, Medicare also covers 190 lifetime days in a psychiatric hospital.\n\nIf you are admitted within 60 days of an inpatient hospital admission in the\npast or if someone transfer immediately from an acute care hospital, there\nwill be no additional deductible for an extended stay. Otherwise, a new\nbenefit period starts if you have beyond the 60-day mark. You will have to\nfulfill the Part A deductible again at the start of each new benefit period.\n\n### Skilled Nursing Facility Care:\n\nExpert Nursing Facility, providers of Medicare or drug plans is medical\nattention provided to diagnose and cure your disease by a trained nurse or\ntherapist. If you have a hospital stay or your doctor has determined you need\nskilled care daily, the facility is Medicare-certified, and there are still\ndays left in your benefit period. Part A coverage covers this on a short-term\nbasis for drug plans.\n\nMedicare pays for lodging, food, and find other open services offered at an\nSNF, such as the administration of medication, tube feedings, and wound\ndressings. If you are eligible for coverage, you are covered for up to 100\ndays throughout each benefit period. To be eligible, you must find skilled\nnursing or therapy treatments and have spent at least three successive days in\nthe hospital within 30 days of your SNF admission.\n\n### Hospice in Medicare:\n\nWhen you decide to get hospice care rather than therapy for a terminal\nillness, Medicare and other providers will pay for most of your medical\nexpenses. Part A Includes treatment to relieve your symptoms and reduce your\ndiscomfort if you are chronically sick. Furthermore, it covers official home\nmedical devices and residential care. You are covered if your provider\nverifies you require treatment and care.\n\n### Home Health Care in Part A:\n\nPart-time or occasional skilled nursing care, physiotherapy, speech-language\npathology treatments, or ongoing occupational therapy services are covered by\nMedicare if they are medically required. Medical social care, part-time or\noccasional home-based healthcare services, durable healthcare equipment, and\nhospital-quality medical supplies are all examples of additional home\nhealthcare. Before certifying that you require home health care services, a\ndoctor or other health care professional must examine you. A physician or\nother healthcare must prescribe your care professional. Furthermore, it must\nbe delivered by a home health company certified by Medicare.\n\nIf you are \u201chomebound,\u201d which is defined as you may require frequent or\noccasional professional care, Medicare will pay for your home health care. It\nimplies:\n\n  * Based on your health condition, you cannot leave your house without the help of a wheelchair, walker, crutches, or the support of another person.\n  * It\u2019s risky to leave the house, considering your health.\n  * Normally, you are unable to leave your home because it requires a lot of effort.\n\n##\n\nSet Appointment\n\nThis appointment is meant to alleviate any concerns and there is no-cost or\nobligation to make a change.\n\nSet Appointment\n\n## Medicare Part A Costs\n\nIn most cases, people eligible for Medicare Part A do not have to pay a\npremium. It applies to you in the following circumstances:\n\nSuppose you are 65 years old and have paid Medicare taxes (FICA) for ten\nyears. It also applies if your spouse or former spouse has paid FICA taxes for\nat least 10 years.\n\nIf you are a disabled individual and have paid FICA taxes for 10 years, you\nare eligible for Medicare after receiving Social Security benefits for 2\nyears. Again, this applies if a spouse has paid the FICA taxes for at least 10\nyears.\n\nIf the above points do not apply, you can still purchase Part A coverage,\nthough you must pay a premium. If you choose to purchase Part A, your monthly\npremium will range from $278 to $505 based on how long you or your spouse\nworked and contributed to Medicare taxes.\n\nIn most cases, purchasing Part A also involves purchasing Part B and paying\nmonthly premiums for both. If you are qualified, you may still purchase Part B\neven if you decide not to purchase Part A.\n\nRemember that your monthly premium could increase by 10% if you aren\u2019t\nqualified for Part A\u2019s premium-free option and don\u2019t purchase it when you\nfirst become eligible. You will have to pay the higher premium for twice as\nmany years as you might have had Part A but didn\u2019t sign up.\n\n## What does Medicare Part A NOT cover?\n\nMedicare does not offer coverage for every service. Any services you require\nthat are not covered by Part you must pay for A or Part B unless:\n\n  * You have additional insurance, like Medicaid, to cover the expenses.\n  * You have a Medicare Advantage or Cost Plan that covers these services as part of your enrollment. Some supplemental benefits, like workout routines and visual, auditory, and dental services, may be covered by Medicare Advantage Plans and Medicare Cost Plans.\n\nMedicare part A does not provide coverage for some items and services, such\nplans include:\n\n  * Various Dental Services\n  * Eye Tests (for prescription glasses)\n  * Dentures\n  * Cosmetic Procedures\n  * Massage Treatment\n  * Regular Physical Examinations\n  * Examinations for Fitting Hearing Aids\n  * Long-term Care\n  * Concierge Services (also referred to as concierge medicine, retainer-based medicine, boutique medicine, platinum practice, or direct care)\n  * Products or services you receive from an opt-out physician or other providers (except for an emergency or urgent need).\n\n## Medicare Part A Deductibles and Copays\n\nA deductible for official Medicare Part A Insurance is assessed for each\nbenefit period.\n\n  * The beginning of a benefit period Insurance is the day you join, check and find a hospital or skilled nursing facility for treatment, and it concludes when you will be out of the facility for 60 straight days. You might visit the hospital more than once throughout this period.\n  * There is no restriction on the number of benefit periods you may have. They are all covered by Medicare.\n  * The Part A deductible is charged for each benefit period.\n\nThere are copays for Medicare Part A while you are hospitalized, in a nursing\nhome, or in hospice care. For each, the copays and regulations function\ndifferently.\n\n  * Hospital copays depend on how long you stay. You can use up your lifetime reserve days if you stay longer than 90 days.\n  * Medicare Part A insurance charges copays for skilled nursing facilities each benefit period. By the number of days you stay in the facility receiving therapy.\n  * Part A copay for hospice care is required for using adaptive medical devices in the home, discomfort, symptom management drugs, and residential care.\n\n## FAQs\n\n### What Is Medicare Part A?\n\nMedicare Part A insurance pays the medically essential expenses related to an\ninpatient hospital stay.
