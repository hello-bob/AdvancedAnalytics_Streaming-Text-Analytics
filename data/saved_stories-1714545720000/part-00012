2024\n\nShare\n\nTranscript\n\n0:03\n\nMy guest today is a science fiction writer whose novel,\n\n0:06\n\nChildren of Time,\n\n0:07\n\nis a story with rapidly evolving spiders,\n\n0:10\n\nants that can clear a forest,\n\n0:13\n\nand the desperate crew of humanity's last survivors.\n\n0:16\n\nHe's written many stories with an interest in animal worlds, which have won\nseveral awards.\n\n0:21\n\nHis latest book is Alien Clay.\n\n0:24\n\nWe spoke about spider ecology, science fiction, and British people's distaste\nfor awards in March 2024.\n\n0:35\n\nYou've said before that something you're shooting for as a fiction author is a\n\n0:40\n\nworld that feels real and is bigger than the book.\n\n0:44\n\nDo you develop a storyline as a first step or do you kind of jump into a world\nand find characters there?\n\n0:52\n\nSo for me, the world always comes first.\n\n0:58\n\nUsually I am interested in writing about a world.\n\n1:01\n\nI work on the world and I kind of get to the point, ideally, where I'm very\nfamiliar with it.\n\n1:06\n\nI'm very immersed in it.\n\n1:08\n\nI understand how the various levels of it work.\n\n1:12\n\nAnd from that,\n\n1:13\n\nfor me,\n\n1:14\n\nthe characters will arise and the story will arise because I will see from the\n\n1:18\n\nworld who are going to be the interesting people,\n\n1:20\n\nwho are going to be the people who will have those interesting kind of\nconflicts\n\n1:23\n\nand clashes and friction.\n\n1:26\n\nWhere are the interesting stories going to come from?\n\n1:27\n\nAnd it generally\n\n1:29\n\narises out of the world.\n\n1:31\n\nAnd it's possible that the world,\n\n1:32\n\nwhen I start off,\n\n1:33\n\nI'll think,\n\n1:33\n\nwell,\n\n1:33\n\nI want a world where this sort of thing happens.\n\n1:37\n\nBut in general, the world is always the core of whatever I'm doing.\n\n1:41\n\nAnd I should note, this is absolutely a very personal process.\n\n1:44\n\nAnd I know plenty of writers who wouldn't do any things in any way in that\nkind of manner.\n\n1:50\n\nEveryone has their own kind of way of approaching things.\n\n1:53\n\nAnd is that something that sort of changed since you started writing stories?\n\n1:56\n\nOr did you kind of have that style from the beginning?\n\n1:59\n\nI've always, always been that kind of world first writer.\n\n2:03\n\nI always wanted to present the environments and the kind of the systems and\nthe\n\n2:10\n\ncreatures and so forth to my readers.\n\n2:13\n\num and i use the story and the characters as kind of a vehicle to do that\nwhich is\n\n2:17\n\na very backwards way of doing things i'm aware um by most by many authors\n\n2:22\n\napproaches but for me i need the sense that the place i'm writing in is it has\nthat\n\n2:27\n\nkind of internal consistency and reality and hopefully that comes through in\nthe\n\n2:31\n\nwriting so that my people who are reading the books feel that they are reading\n\n2:35\n\nabout a place that has an existence beyond the specific incidents and people\nthat\n\n2:39\n\nyou're meeting yeah you have a lot of interesting\n\n2:42\n\nnon-human characters in your stories and I'm curious like how do you decide\nwhich\n\n2:47\n\naspects of an animal's ecology or behavior you want to incorporate in a story?\n\n2:53\n\nUsually the individual creature will suggest what are the important ones\nalthough\n\n2:57\n\nvery often my starting point is frequently the sensorium because if you know\nhow a\n\n3:04\n\ncreature kind of apprehends the world then that tells you a lot about how it\nthinks\n\n3:08\n\nand what is important to it and what it will react to\n\n3:11\n\nand you can build out from that.\n\n3:14\n\nDo you have a favorite example of ecology in science fiction?\n\n3:19\n\nSue Burke's Semiosis is very good actually.\n\n3:23\n\nIt's an ecology that is dominated by kind of interrelated sapient,\n\n3:31\n\nwhat you know to a human viewpoint is plant life and the way that the whole\necology\n\n3:36\n\nis kind of being run and managed by the actual\n\n3:40\n\nplants themselves um in this enormous kind of interconnected community that's\n\n3:45\n\nreally interesting that's one i'm not familiar with so that's one i'll have to\nlook\n\n3:49\n\nup i really liked the phrase measuring legs i was curious is that something\nthat\n\n3:56\n\nyou came up with or and could you describe what that meant\n\n4:00\n\nYeah, so measuring legs is used in the book.\n\n4:05\n\nIt is the spider equivalent of a dick measuring contest.\n\n4:09\n\nThere are various sort of spider mating and threat displays that involve kind\nof raising the legs.\n\n4:14\n\nAnd one of the things you do,\n\n4:15\n\nyou're getting a sense of the size and the physical power of the other spider\nby\n\n4:19\n\nsort of how energetic it is and how big the legs are and the span and that\nkind of thing.\n\n4:23\n\nOr that's at least how we've interpreted it.\n\n4:26\n\nAnd so as the society goes on,\n\n4:29\n\nthey don't necessarily do that physically,\n\n4:31\n\nbut it becomes a kind of a watchword for someone trying to kind of throw their\n\n4:34\n\nweight around and show you how important they are.\n\n4:36\n\nOr getting into that, getting into a leg measuring contest effectively and\nthat kind of thing.\n\n4:41\n\nSo it just seemed,\n\n4:42\n\nit's based on real spider behavior,\n\n4:44\n\nbut it also seemed to me that would become a kind of a figure of speech or a\nkind\n\n4:49\n\nof a social convention beyond the original sort of,\n\n4:54\n\nthe original involved purpose of it.\n\n4:56\n\nThat's very interesting.\n\n4:58\n\nWhat I was researching,\n\n5:00\n\nit seemed like the largest known fossil spider is about half the size of its\nmodern relative.\n\n5:07\n\nI'm curious, what do you think about the constraints that keep spiders small?\n\n5:13\n\nIs it a coincidence of evolution they haven't had bigger bodies?\n\n5:17\n\nIt's absolutely fascinating that we genuinely live in the age of giant spiders\nright now.\n\n5:22\n\nAnd there was a point when we thought there was a very,\n\n5:25\n\nvery large sort of Carboniferous spider,\n\n5:28\n\nwhich is Megarachne,\n\n5:29\n\nwhich has then been reinterpreted as a marine scorpion relative.\n\n5:35\n\nGiven that certainly in the Carboniferous,\n\n5:38\n\nfor a variety of reasons,\n\n5:39\n\nthere were some very large arthropods going about,\n\n5:42\n\nThere is an Arthropleura, which was a millipede about six foot long, which is\nan amazing thing.\n\n5:49\n\nWe know it was also land bound because we have the tracks that it's left,\n\n5:54\n\nas well as partial fossils of it.\n\n5:55\n\nIt's an amazing creature.\n\n5:56\n\nSo we know they could get very big.\n\n5:58\n\nAnd it's not the simple fact of having the exoskeleton or the ways of\nbreathing\n\n6:04\n\nweren't actually necessarily the hard limiters we might think they were.\n\n6:09\n\nSo why wasn't there a big spider?\n\n6:11\n\nAnd the answer is we don't necessarily know.\n\n6:12\n\nIt may just be maybe that there was one we haven't found,\n\n6:14\n\nor it may simply be that there was never one because particular spider\nlifestyle\n\n6:19\n\nchoices precluded it.\n\n6:21\n\nI mean,\n\n6:21\n\nspiders have,\n\n6:23\n\nas I talk about in children,\n\n6:24\n\nthey have book lungs,\n\n6:26\n\nwhich is a more efficient respiration system than insects.\n\n6:31\n\nAnd insects certainly got very large in the Carboniferous period.\n\n6:35\n\nAnd so...\n\n6:37\n\nIt is possible simply that if early spiders moved on to web spinning,\n\n6:43\n\nthen presumably there is a limit to how big you can get and really sit on a\nweb easily.\n\n6:48\n\nBut yeah,\n\n6:50\n\nI don't think we found a fossil spider anywhere near as big as,\n\n6:53\n\nsay,\n\n6:54\n\na bird-eating spider or a goliath spider in the modern day.\n\n6:57\n\nAnd it's a genuinely fascinating point of paleontology because there are close\n\n7:02\n\nrelatives like scorpions that got very big indeed.\n\n7:06\n\nRight.\n\n7:07\n\nAnd the technology of the silk seemed so helpful,\n\n7:11\n\nyou'd think,\n\n7:11\n\nthat they would have experienced a lot of success and gotten big.\n\n7:14\n\nThe thing, I mean, the other thing to remember is getting big doesn't\nnecessarily equate to success.\n\n7:19\n\nThere's obviously some sort of biological mechanism whereby if things have a\nclear\n\n7:23\n\nrun at getting big,\n\n7:23\n\nthey will do so.\n\n7:25\n\nAnd it is quite possibly because of things like breeding success.\n\n7:30\n\nSo that size is frequently a\n\n7:32\n\ninterrelates heavily with perceived fitness in many species and that kind of\nthing.\n\n7:37\n\nOr just if you can physically shunt your rivals out of the way, as happened\nwith a lot of beetle species.\n\n7:43\n\nBut being big has a lot of disadvantages.\n\n7:46\n\nIt's energetically costly.\n\n7:48\n\nIt potentially makes you more vulnerable to predation because you can't hide\nas well.\n\n7:53\n\nAnd so there are, I mean,\n\n7:57\n\nIf you look at insects and if you study insects in any way,\n\n8:01\n\nyou work out that very quickly that actually being big does not in any way\nmean success.\n\n8:05\n\nFrequently, many insects are very successful because they're not big.\n\n8:09\n\nWhat were you like as a kid?\n\n8:10\n\nWhat were your dreams growing up?\n\n8:12\n\nIt wasn't the sort of thing that people were necessarily saying at the time,\n\n8:15\n\nbut what I was like at the kid was probably quite severely autistic.\n\n8:19\n\nI did not get on with people.\n\n8:21\n\nI had enormously strong fascinations.\n\n8:24\n\nI was\n\n8:26\n\nrepeatedly told by teachers in primary school that if i considered to just try\nand\n\n8:31\n\ndrag spiders into everything i would never get anywhere in life which is\nadvice\n\n8:34\n\nthat i thankfully completely ignored um i was a huge sci-fi buff i love doctor\nwho\n\n8:40\n\ni love star wars honestly i was kind of like an awful lot of science fiction\nfans\n\n8:45\n\nand science fiction writers and then by about the age of 13 i got into role-\nplaying\n\n8:50\n\ngames which is another very common uh hobby for writers of my sort of general\n\n8:55\n\ngeneration i've\n\n8:56\n\nhonestly never stopped playing them since i mean i mean three active games at\nthe\n\n8:59\n\nmoment nice do you think humans are the only animal that imagines fictitious\n\n9:06\n\ncreatures is that tied to our facility of language and storytelling or could\nit be\n\n9:11\n\ntied to dreams oh now that is a fascinating question i don't think i've ever\nheard\n\n9:18\n\nthat asked before that's a really good one um\n\n9:22\n\nAnd obviously we can't know.\n\n9:24\n\nI would like to think,\n\n9:26\n\nI guess,\n\n9:27\n\nthat that level of imagination evolved earlier and that it isn't necessarily\ntied\n\n9:34\n\nto language.\n\n9:37\n\nI guess the thing that when you bring language into the mixed,\n\n9:42\n\nyou are able to communicate your imaginings and your dreams and things to\nothers\n\n9:47\n\nand that in that conversation build upon it so that your imaginative life\nbecomes a\n\n9:51\n\nlot richer.\n\n9:53\n\nIt's interesting because one kind of feels,\n\n9:55\n\ncertainly dreams as we experience them,\n\n9:57\n\nbecause they are not simply the replaying of memories.\n\n10:00\n\nThere is a definite inspirational, imaginative element to dreams.\n\n10:06\n\nWe kind of know that a lot of other animals seem to have,\n\n10:09\n\nfrom brain activity,\n\n10:12\n\ndreamlike experiences while sleeping,\n\n10:14\n\nup to and including jumping spiders,\n\n10:16\n\nwhich is a relatively recent discovery.\n\n10:19\n\nAnd we see eye movements in animals that can actually move their eyes.\n\n10:23\n\nAnd with spiders,\n\n10:24\n\njumping spiders have a kind of a mobile eye component because they've got very\n\n10:27\n\nadvanced eyes for spiders.\n\n10:28\n\nAnd we see that when they sleep,\n\n10:30\n\nthat moves around as if they are in very much the same way as a human or a dog\nor\n\n10:35\n\nthat kind of thing.\n\n10:38\n\nOn that basis,\n\n10:39\n\nyou're kind of,\n\n10:40\n\nif you're seeing a thing in a dream,\n\n10:42\n\nyou are kind of imagining a fictitious thing.\n\n10:45\n\nSo...\n\n10:46\n\nwhether obviously that the fictitious things that a dog or a cat or a mouse or\na\n\n10:53\n\nspider even are perceiving or sensing in it whatever senses they're using in\ndreams\n\n11:00\n\ngo beyond simply recreating a thing that exists in the real i don't know but\nthe\n\n11:05\n\npossibility would seem to be inherent in the experience of dreaming that you\ncan go\n\n11:10\n\nbeyond the bounds of reality because you're not simply replaying um\n\n11:16\n\nyour actual memories although obviously with with um with species which have a\nmuch\n\n11:23\n\nsimpler cognition dreaming may be very little more than what we would feel is\njust\n\n11:29\n\nvery unformed experiences obviously it is one of the it's fascinating and i\nsuspect\n\n11:33\n\nwe will never ever be able to know but well\n\n11:41\n\nI feel it's inherent in the nature of dreams that some sort of confabulation\nis going on.\n\n11:48\n\nVery interesting.\n\n11:49\n\nWhat's an animal that you would bring back from extinction?\n\n11:53\n\nThe obvious answer is sea scorpions or trilobites or some other arthropod like\nthat.\n\n12:00\n\nThat's obvious?\n\n12:03\n\nTo those who know my work,\n\n12:04\n\nthat's obviously where I'm going to go,\n\n12:06\n\nor giant dragonflies or something like that.\n\n12:08\n\nI think that there is a,\n\n12:10\n\nyou know,\n\n12:11\n\nwhich is never going to happen because we're talking about things that are not\njust\n\n12:15\n\nbeing gone,\n\n12:17\n\nsort of the tens of thousands of years of mammoths,\n\n12:20\n\nbut are being gone for multiple hundreds of millions of years,\n\n12:24\n\nhave been gone since before the first dinosaur,\n\n12:26\n\nthat kind of thing.\n\n12:27\n\nSo there's obviously,\n\n12:28\n\nthere's absolutely no genetic,\n\n12:30\n\nI mean,\n\n12:32\n\ngenetic information decays sufficiently fast that even a Jurassic Park level\nof\n\n12:35\n\nreconstruction isn't actually possible as far as we know.\n\n12:38\n\nBringing back things from extinction is a bit of a thorny moral issue.\n\n12:47\n\nEven in Jurassic Park, it explicitly acknowledges that they're not bringing\nback dinosaurs.\n\n12:51\n\nThey are creating a dinosaur-looking thing from this mishmash of DNA that have\na bit of dinosaur in it.\n\n12:56\n\nAnd you could do that.\n\n12:57\n\nYou could probably do that starting with a chicken, honestly.\n\n12:59\n\nThere are probably easier ways than mucking about with Amber.\n\n13:02\n\nAnd making a dinosaur from a chicken is absolutely something that has been\nsort of\n\n13:08\n\nat least lightly discussed by scientists,\n\n13:10\n\njust reverse engineering them from birds,\n\n13:13\n\nbecause now we know that birds are basically dinosaurs.\n\n13:17\n\nMammoths are the classic one.\n\n13:17\n\nPeople are always talking about bringing back mammoths.\n\n13:20\n\nIf a mammoth is anything like an elephant,\n\n13:21\n\nand we have reason to believe it's very like an elephant,\n\n13:24\n\nelephants are social creatures.\n\n13:26\n\nIf elephants become extinct and then you recreate an elephant,\n\n13:29\n\nwhich we could probably do,\n\n13:31\n\nthat elephant isn't really an elephant because elephants are a product of\n\n13:34\n\ngenerational society and learning.\n\n13:38\n\ngoing back 1000s and 1000s of years.\n\n13:41\n\nIf you if you wipe out elephant and then bring back an elephant or even some\nelephants,\n\n13:46\n\nyou have lost what it is for them to be elephants in the same way that if you\nwipe\n\n13:50\n\nout people,\n\n13:51\n\nand then some aliens come along and just recreate a bunch of people.\n\n13:55\n\nYou know, where's the language coming from?\n\n13:56\n\nWhere's the culture coming from?\n\n13:58\n\nAnd so there is a real quandary with this sort of thing.\n\n14:01\n\nAnd I feel that\n\n14:04\n\nthe idea of recreating,\n\n14:05\n\nand I appreciate this is a very heavy answer to a relatively light question,\n\n14:11\n\nbut it is an important point.\n\n14:14\n\nWhen people are talking about recreating these things,\n\n14:16\n\nit's basically going to be as shallow as what's the name of Richard\nAttenborough's\n\n14:22\n\ncharacter's aims in Jurassic Park.\n\n14:26\n\nIt's basically banal entertainment that owes nothing to any kind of real\nspirit of science.\n\n14:32\n\nIt's just like, hey, we've got a mammoth, and then\n\n14:34\n\nfive minutes later everyone's seen the mammoth and nobody cares yeah very\n\n14:37\n\ninteresting place to take that too and so it sounds like if you had if you had\na\n\n14:41\n\nred button to push to bring back something from you know within the last 10\nmillion\n\n14:46\n\nyears you're probably not going to push it it sounds like i mean honestly\nsomeone\n\n14:49\n\ngive me if someone gave me a big red button and says yeah you can have um oh\nlord\n\n14:55\n\num shinder harness or\n\n14:58\n\nI think it's Jekyllopterus, the eight-foot sea scorpion, and just fill the\nocean with those.\n\n15:02\n\nI'm not sure I'd be able to restrain myself, but I don't think it would be a\ngood idea.\n\n15:06\n\nBut I'm certainly not immune to bad ideas.\n\n15:10\n\nAre there any rare old books that you've drawn inspiration from?\n\n15:15\n\nI generally, for me, the book is its contents.\n\n15:19\n\nI'm not a collector.\n\n15:20\n\nI collect occasionally beautiful books like special editions, like Polio\nSociety, things like that.\n\n15:26\n\num or books i like um i mean possibly even i don't my camera is at the\nslightly\n\n15:32\n\nwrong angle but i've got like the dune special edition on the shelf over there\num i\n\n15:37\n\ni don't don't generally get hold of antique books or anything like that um the\nbook\n\n15:42\n\nthat would fascinate me for its content is probably the voynich manuscript um\nwhich\n\n15:46\n\nremains a complete enigma as to whether it there is any kind of do you know do\nyou\n\n15:51\n\nknow they\n\n15:53\n\nSo this is a book from, I cannot quite remember, I think it's 1600s, 1700s.\n\n15:59\n\nIt is this completely big, fully illustrated tome that is completely\nincomprehensible.\n\n16:05\n\nIt's written in what appears to be kind of like a nonsense alphabet.\n\n16:09\n\nIt has all of these very bizarre, sort of pseudo-alchemical looking\nillustrations.\n\n16:15\n\nNobody knows if it is an enormously elaborate joke or whether it is genuinely\n\n16:20\n\nencoded language or what is going on.\n\n16:23\n\nNew theories pop up every so often about what on earth is the Voynich\nmanuscript.\n\n16:28\n\nIf you look it up, it's reasonably well, you can find lots of\n\n16:33\n\nimages from it online but it is it remains one of those completely mind-\nboggling\n\n16:39\n\nartifacts because either it means something and even if what it means is just\nthis\n\n16:44\n\nnonsense alchemy that doesn't actually work or anything like someone or it is\nthis\n\n16:48\n\nphenomenal practical joke that someone must have spent years over but what and\n\n16:53\n\nhonestly there was kind of a market at the time people were very much into\n\n16:57\n\nvarious kind of occult studies and sciences so quite possibly making a\nnonsense\n\n17:01\n\nbook and then selling it for thousands of ducats or whatever it would would\nhave\n\n17:04\n\nbeen a worthwhile venture but we don't know and it's absolutely fascinating oh\nvery\n\n17:09\n\ninteresting\n\n17:10\n\nif you were going to give a pep talk to someone who was going to visit the\nworld of\n\n17:15\n\none of your novels,\n\n17:16\n\nwhat would you say to prepare them for the experience?\n\n17:19\n\nDon't, don't for the love of God.\n\n17:21\n\nI mean,\n\n17:22\n\nthis is,\n\n17:22\n\nyou get the occasion,\n\n17:23\n\nthe,\n\n17:23\n\nthe,\n\n17:23\n\nthe,\n\n17:23\n\nthe,\n\n17:24\n\nthe similar question you often get is,\n\n17:25\n\nyou know,\n\n17:25\n\nif you could go and live in any of your novels,\n\n17:27\n\nwhich one would you go and do?\n\n17:28\n\nAnd really, I don't want to live in any of my novels because they're horrible\nplaces.\n\n17:31\n\nThe terrible things happen to people.\n\n17:33\n\nI mean, I mean, I mean,\n\n17:36\n\nI think the alternative to the other problem is,\n\n17:39\n\nyes,\n\n17:39\n\nthere are places in,\n\n17:40\n\nI mean,\n\n17:41\n\nI think,\n\n17:41\n\nfor example,\n\n17:42\n\nyou could probably have a reasonably pleasant time of things in Collegium in\nthe\n\n17:49\n\nWorld of Shadows of the Apt.\n\n17:50\n\nYeah,\n\n17:52\n\nI could do a little kind of etiquette manual of topics not to talk about,\n\n17:56\n\nsort of don't mention the war sort of thing.\n\n18:00\n\nThere are plenty of places,\n\n18:01\n\nI mean,\n\n18:03\n\nagain,\n\n18:03\n\nthe whole etiquette manual I could give for going to the universe of the final\narchitecture,\n\n18:07\n\nwhich is my space opera trilogy,\n\n18:11\n\nto do with which alien species you can get on with and which ones are going to\nbe\n\n18:15\n\nproblematic and what topics not to bring up to...\n\n18:19\n\nhow not to be political in a rather sort of tempestuous environment.\n\n18:23\n\nAnd if you can do that,\n\n18:25\n\nthen actually that's quite a nice universe to visit as long as there aren't\n\n18:28\n\nenormous moon-sized entities destroying the planet you're on,\n\n18:31\n\nwhich is the thing that happens in the series.\n\n18:33\n\nSo it's a bit of a potluck sort of holiday.\n\n18:37\n\nMaybe don't go.\n\n18:38\n\nI think it's one of those...\n\n18:39\n\nIt's very hard to think of any kind...\n\n18:41\n\nI mean,\n\n18:42\n\nI know people say,\n\n18:42\n\noh,\n\n18:42\n\nI'd love to visit Middle-Earth.\n\n18:44\n\nAnd the answer is, really?\n\n18:44\n\nWould you really love to visit Middle-Earth?\n\n18:48\n\nEven if you were literally the guest of the steward of Gondor or something,\n\n18:52\n\nwould it actually be that comfortable or pleasant or anything other than\nterrifying\n\n18:58\n\nto be anywhere near any of these people?\n\n19:00\n\nAnd that's,\n\n19:00\n\nof course,\n\n19:00\n\nthe things that make these stories interesting or also the things that would\nmake\n\n19:05\n\nactually being anywhere near them be absolutely terrifying experiences.\n\n19:10\n\nI think for me,\n\n19:11\n\nI mean,\n\n19:11\n\ngoing into Dogs of War and trying to get those animals on my side and like,\n\n19:16\n\nyou know,\n\n19:18\n\nhave them be my private army, I feel like that would be pretty fun.\n\n19:20\n\nBut, you know, perilous for sure.\n\n19:23\n\nI mean,\n\n19:23\n\nI hate to say it,\n\n19:24\n\nbut if you want them to be your private army,\n\n19:25\n\nthat does make you the bad guy in the book.\n\n19:29\n\nTrue.\n\n19:29\n\nYeah, that's fair.\n\n19:32\n\nLet me jump into a question about AI.\n\n19:35\n\nSo recently we sort of flew past the Turing test with ChatGPT.\n\n19:39\n\nDo you think scaling up large language models could summon an artificial\ngeneral intelligence?\n\n19:47\n\num pretty pretty definitively no because that's not what they do um it is a\nit's a\n\n19:54\n\npattern mimicking machine it's the there is nothing in the functioning of that\nthat\n\n20:02\n\nleaves room for an eye to develop\n\n20:06\n\nI in intelligent or I as in self, either way.\n\n20:11\n\nIt can be very good at producing lifelike text,\n\n20:15\n\nbut only because it's got an enormous library of lifelike text to draw upon.\n\n20:18\n\nI mean, do you know the, are you familiar with the concept of a Chinese rune?\n\n20:22\n\nNo.\n\n20:26\n\nA thought experiment.\n\n20:26\n\nI mean, it is, I will absolutely go in for it.\n\n20:29\n\nWe need a better name for that because it is kind of a problematic name for\nit.\n\n20:33\n\nBut the idea is you are,\n\n20:35\n\nyou are someone,\n\n20:36\n\nyou're in a room,\n\n20:36\n\nyou get communications in that you do not understand,\n\n20:41\n\nbut you have a big reference library.\n\n20:42\n\nYou look them up and you turn them into,\n\n20:45\n\nyou take the,\n\n20:46\n\nwell,\n\n20:46\n\nthis means I then write that and you turn it off and effectively you are doing\na\n\n20:49\n\nkind of a translation exercise without understanding either of the languages\ninvolved.\n\n20:53\n\nAnd that is what an LLM is.\n\n20:55\n\nThere is no thought involved.\n\n20:59\n\nIt is a very,\n\n21:00\n\nvery complicated,\n\n21:02\n\nextremely fast,\n\n21:03\n\nmonstrously energy-hungry process for basically finding a best fit to what\nwould\n\n21:15\n\nthis look like.\n\n21:16\n\nAnd the other thing that kind of makes me despair that we're calling these\nthings AI is\n\n21:22\n\nIn science fiction, AI has traditionally been something a bit like Commander\nData from Star Trek.\n\n21:28\n\nYou have someone who is very logical,\n\n21:30\n\nvery effective and very truth rooted in truth and accuracy and rather confused\nby vibe.\n\n21:39\n\nWhat you get out of a language learning model is all 100% vibe and zero\nrecognition of truth or meaning.\n\n21:46\n\nAnd that's becoming a really serious problem because people are using AIs to\n\n21:50\n\nproduce what should be factual books.\n\n21:52\n\nThere was a very famous one a little while ago,\n\n21:54\n\nwhich was a guide to edible mushrooms that was entirely AI generated.\n\n21:58\n\nYou can't do a guide to edible mushrooms through an AI.\n\n22:01\n\nYou'll get people killed because the AI doesn't actually care whether the\n\n22:05\n\ninformation it's providing with is true or not.\n\n22:07\n\nIt cares whether it looks like the sort of thing that would be in a guide to\nmushrooms.\n\n22:11\n\nWe're getting this with academic articles.\n\n22:12\n\nWe're getting this with people are starting to use these things for teaching.\n\n22:16\n\nPeople do not understand that these things are not truth machines.\n\n22:20\n\nThey are vibe machines.\n\n22:21\n\nThey will produce you something that looks plausibly like the sort of text or\nimage\n\n22:26\n\nor whatever it is that you want.\n\n22:30\n\nBut,\n\n22:30\n\nyou know,\n\n22:31\n\nI saw recently there was a cookbook,\n\n22:33\n\na cookbook that had been purchased by a hospital for use by the patients.\n\n22:38\n\nIt's generated by AI.\n\n22:39\n\nIt had\n\n22:41\n\ningredients list of things that didn't exist.\n\n22:45\n\nIt had stuff that just looked in a sort of an out of focus blurry way, like\nthey were recipes.\n\n22:54\n\nBut the AI has no concept of whether any of these things work.\n\n22:56\n\nAnd in the same way,\n\n22:58\n\nif it was writing a book,\n\n22:59\n\nwhich is people are desperate to have AIs write books,\n\n23:02\n\nyou couldn't write books,\n\n23:04\n\nthe books that I write with an AI,\n\n23:05\n\nbecause I write books based on that ground up structure of meaning.\n\n23:10\n\nso everything works together.\n\n23:11\n\nI don't just throw a bunch of references at the wall and have a thing that\nlooks a\n\n23:15\n\nbit like an epic fantasy.\n\n23:16\n\nThere you go.\n\n23:19\n\nI don't think that the process involved that we're seeing from these models is\never\n\n23:25\n\ngoing to give us a general AI or a powerful AI.\n\n23:28\n\nAnd although what I do feel is this current bubble that is going to kind of\ngrow\n\n23:34\n\nand then at some point pop\n\n23:36\n\nof people vastly investing in any kind of project where you attach the two\nletters\n\n23:39\n\nAI to it will probably set back genuine AI research by a whole generation.\n\n23:46\n\nThat's a really depressing thing.\n\n23:49\n\nThis is absolutely a false start and a dead end,\n\n23:51\n\nand it's going to do irreparable harm to our ability to actually ever do find\na\n\n23:56\n\ngenuinely useful AI that can actually give us useful,\n\n24:00\n\nmeaningful answers to anything.\n\n24:02\n\nOn the topic of existential risk,\n\n24:06\n\nhow do you think about humanity's existential risk or the risk of being\nknocked\n\n24:10\n\nback to the Stone Age?\n\n24:12\n\nAnd what would need to change in the world to make you feel more optimistic\nabout\n\n24:17\n\nour chances of flourishing in the next century?\n\n24:19\n\nHuman nature.\n\n24:20\n\nThat's a very glib answer.\n\n24:24\n\nSo, I mean, basically, and it's kind of unfair because actually there is a lot\nof human nature that is...\n\n24:30\n\nwilling to change.\n\n24:31\n\nI mean, I think what would have to be what have to change is our attitude to\nleadership.\n\n24:36\n\nBecause we seem to be very easily hijacked by people by a very narrow group of\n\n24:43\n\npeople with a profound interest in maintaining the status quo,\n\n24:47\n\nbecause it will give them bumper profits,\n\n24:49\n\nprofits in the next financial quarter or whatever.\n\n24:54\n\nand who don't care what happens in five years' time,\n\n24:56\n\nor who believe that their money and power will insulate them from whatever\nhappens\n\n25:00\n\nin five years' time,\n\n25:01\n\nwhich I guess is kind of the same.\n\n25:04\n\nI think that we have, at this point now, the technology to sort ourselves out.\n\n25:10\n\nI think that a lot of people would genuinely be willing to make the variety of\n\n25:14\n\nsmall sacrifices,\n\n25:15\n\nbut bearing in mind that a small number of industries,\n\n25:19\n\na small number of companies even,\n\n25:21\n\nare responsible for a vast percentage of the\n\n25:25\n\nsay,\n\n25:26\n\nthe carbon emissions that are causing,\n\n25:28\n\ndirectly causing global warming,\n\n25:30\n\ncausing climate change,\n\n25:32\n\nwhat you need is regulation.\n\n25:33\n\nWhat you need is a strong government that actually cares about these things\nand is\n\n25:38\n\nnot deeply,\n\n25:39\n\ndeeply concerned about the profits of the fossil fuel industry,\n\n25:41\n\nsay,\n\n25:42\n\nor various other industries that are causing problems.\n\n25:44\n\nWe need a more science-led approach.\n\n25:47\n\nWe need a more rational approach.\n\n25:48\n\nWe need people to somehow have the ability to understand that\n\n25:54\n\nThis ridiculous outpouring of conspiracy theories is basically just\ndistracting\n\n26:00\n\nthem from the genuine problems that are going on.\n\n26:03\n\nWe need a lot of stuff like that.\n\n26:05\n\nAnd I don't think we're going to get it, but I think it's doable.\n\n26:08\n\nAnd I think,\n\n26:08\n\ntherefore,\n\n26:08\n\nif we fail to save ourselves and we do end up back in the Stone Age,\n\n26:12\n\nthen as we bang those rocks together,\n\n26:14\n\nwe only have ourselves to blame.\n\n26:15\n\nI more or less agree with all that.\n\n26:18\n\nYeah.\n\n26:20\n\nIt's fascinating the deep relationships people have with a ship, like a life\nraft.\n\n26:26\n\nA refuge, but also a trap.\n\n26:28\n\nIf you had to live in a submarine,\n\n26:31\n\nan Arctic research station,\n\n26:33\n\na desert tunnel colony,\n\n26:35\n\nor a space colony,\n\n26:36\n\nwhich one are you signing up for?\n\n26:38\n\nAnd what's a companion species you would like to bring with you?\n\n26:44\n\nOh, good Lord.\n\n26:47\n\nI mean, you know what?\n\n26:48\n\nI think...\n\n26:50\n\nThe companion species I'd be most concerned with, who are the other humans\ninvolved?\n\n26:54\n\nI do have a cat,\n\n26:55\n\nbut I'm not particularly,\n\n26:57\n\nweirdly enough for someone who is so very concerned with animals in my\nwriting,\n\n27:00\n\nI've never been particularly an animal keeping person.\n\n27:03\n\nI would like to think that I could probably last in all of those.\n\n27:07\n\nI think space would probably be the most challenging,\n\n27:09\n\npurely because at that point you are screwing around with all sorts of things\nlike gravity,\n\n27:13\n\nand I know I will be hopeless in zero gravity.\n\n27:16\n\nI have zero physical coordination, and it\n\n27:19\n\nIt just wouldn't work.\n\n27:21\n\nI suspect I'd probably be best off at the Arctic because I'm also not terribly\nfond\n\n27:25\n\nof particularly hot weather.\n\n27:26\n\nBut it comes down to people, honestly.\n\n27:29\n\nYou need to choose your neighbors.\n\n27:32\n\nI could live anywhere.\n\n27:32\n\nBut if the person in the next room was really fond of blasting out very loud\nmusic\n\n27:38\n\nall the time,\n\n27:38\n\nI think that would drive me crazy far more than just being in the Antarctic.\n\n27:43\n\nVery true.\n\n27:44\n\nVery good point.\n\n27:44\n\nYeah.\n\n27:44\n\nAll right.\n\n27:46\n\nAn alien spaceship has arrived on Earth and requested to speak with you.\n\n27:50\n\nAfter getting dressed and having a meal, you have 30 minutes to prepare.\n\n27:55\n\nA helicopter is on its way to pick you up.\n\n27:58\n\nHow would you get ready?\n\n27:59\n\nHow would you prepare for first contact?\n\n28:02\n\nWell, I mean, aside from whatever clues can be gleaned from the exterior of\nthe spaceship.\n\n28:08\n\nAssuming there are images available.\n\n28:12\n\nThis is the thing.\n\n28:13\n\nI do not subscribe to the human-like alien idea,\n\n28:22\n\nwhich is beloved of both some sci-fi writers and some philosophers.\n\n28:27\n\nI don't subscribe to what's called the philanthropic theory,\n\n28:29\n\nthe idea that the universe is kind of geared up by its mechanisms to produce\n\n28:33\n\nhuman-like life.\n\n28:35\n\nAnything I think that has evolved on another world would be more alien to us\nthan\n\n28:42\n\nanything we know on Earth by default is going to have entirely different\nmechanisms.\n\n28:47\n\nIt might have some commonality of outlook because we live in the same\nuniverse.\n\n28:51\n\nAnd if it's got a spaceship, then it's presumably got a fairly advanced grasp\nof.\n\n28:56\n\nhow physics works, how the universe works, and you'd have some sort of\noverlap.\n\n29:01\n\nSo I guess what I'd probably start studying is,\n\n29:04\n\nright,\n\n29:04\n\nlet's basically get the cliff notes for particle physics and how stars work\nand\n\n29:12\n\nthese things.\n\n29:12\n\nSo the things that you and they will be looking at from a similar perspective,\n\n29:18\n\nfrom a similar scale,\n\n29:20\n\nyou can potentially start communication like that.\n\n29:23\n\nI mean,\n\n29:23\n\nI guess anyone sending for me in that kind of situation,\n\n29:26\n\nprobably they're spiders or something like that.\n\n29:32\n\nBut yeah, I mean, I think some kind of astrophysics primers.\n\n29:37\n\nSo we'd have something that we'd both be familiar with to talk about.\n\n29:41\n\nAnd other than that, I think just an open mind because aliens are going to be\nalien.\n\n29:46\n\nI mean, this is my touchstone for that.\n\n29:49\n\nI think the closest we've really got to it in film is probably Arrival,\n\n29:54\n\nthe Villeneuve adaptation of the Ted Chiang story,\n\n29:58\n\nbecause the aliens in that are gloriously alien,\n\n30:01\n\nboth physically and in outlook.\n\n30:04\n\nAnd I think that's a very good starting point for anyone thinking, what would\nalien contact look like?\n\n30:08\n\nBecause they turn up and they're genuinely interested in communicating with\nus,\n\n30:12\n\nwhich would not necessarily be the case with aliens.\n\n30:15\n\nAnd even then,\n\n30:16\n\nunderstanding what they want is inordinately difficult because they just don't\nsee\n\n30:20\n\nthe universe,\n\n30:21\n\nvery basic parts of the universe in the same way that we do.\n\n30:24\n\nVery interesting.\n\n30:25\n\nSo you're trying to find something you could talk about.\n\n30:27\n\nAnd then you also mentioned going into it with an open mind.\n\n30:30\n\nI'm curious, do you have...\n\n30:33\n\nIs there like a habit or ritual that maybe you use when you're writing or\nsomething\n\n30:37\n\nto kind of relax and go for a walk,\n\n30:40\n\nmake a cup of tea?\n\n30:43\n\nI mean,\n\n30:43\n\nI certainly,\n\n30:43\n\nthe whole going for a walk or just breaking the routine,\n\n30:48\n\ngoing on a journey,\n\n30:51\n\neven just spending a night away from home,\n\n30:53\n\nall of these things have served to unlock the imagination.\n\n30:57\n\nBut usually what that means is there is a problem I am working on that I,\n\n31:03\n\nthat I need some sort of change of surroundings for some reason helps me fix.\n\n31:07\n\nAnd it's probably just because when I'm away from home, there are fewer\ndistractions.\n\n31:11\n\nAnd so more of my mind can be occupied on dealing with the problem.\n\n31:15\n\nSo it's quite possible once I've had a bit of a look and a bit of an\ninteraction\n\n31:21\n\nwith some sort of alien species,\n\n31:23\n\nthat would be the next thing is right.\n\n31:24\n\nLet's get away and have a bit of a\n\n31:26\n\na head-clearing moment.\n\n31:28\n\nI mean,\n\n31:29\n\none of the things I found,\n\n31:30\n\nI don't tend to work particularly well with talking things through with other\npeople,\n\n31:33\n\nfor example,\n\n31:34\n\nwhich I know is one of the go-tos for a lot of people.\n\n31:37\n\nI do tend to need to find answers myself,\n\n31:39\n\nwhich I think is also a fairly sort of neurodiverse sort of trait I have.\n\n31:44\n\nBut I think that's also,\n\n31:45\n\nyou know,\n\n31:46\n\nfor a writer,\n\n31:46\n\nthat's probably quite a useful way of going about things,\n\n31:49\n\nbecause if you're a writer and you need to constantly talk to other people,\n\n31:52\n\nthat's going to probably annoy a lot of other people.\n\n31:56\n\nYeah, it's probably going to be pretty limiting what you can get done.\n\n31:59\n\nIn Children of Time, you explore rapid evolution and the rise of a non-human\nsociety.\n\n32:05\n\nWhat challenges did you face in writing from the perspective of non-human\nconsciousness?\n\n32:11\n\nSo, I mean, I was talking before about dealing with the sensorium.\n\n32:17\n\nSo with the spiders or with the octopuses in Children of Ruin, the sensorium\nis a big part of it.\n\n32:22\n\nAnd beyond that, I researched the species.\n\n32:25\n\nAnd honestly,\n\n32:26\n\nwith that,\n\n32:27\n\nit tends to mean I find either I find people to talk to or I find some late\nbooks\n\n32:30\n\nthat are reasonably geared towards the moderate,\n\n32:34\n\nthe interested layman,\n\n32:36\n\nreally,\n\n32:36\n\nbecause I am not...\n\n32:38\n\na you know i'm not a full-on scientist i'm not a specialist i need things\nbroken\n\n32:42\n\ndown to me in ways that i can then communicate to my readers and what i the\nway i\n\n32:46\n\ntend to do as part of my world creation process is all of that will go into\nthe\n\n32:49\n\nworld and then each one of the everything i've i'm using every every sort of\n\n32:54\n\ninteresting feature of the life cycle or the what we understand of the\ncognition or\n\n32:59\n\nbehavior is like a stone dropped into a pool and then each each one creates\nripples\n\n33:04\n\ni will see right where do the ripples go\n\n33:06\n\nwhat is the logical follow-on, right?\n\n33:09\n\nWell, if they're like this, then what does that mean as far as their problem\nsolving?\n\n33:14\n\nWhat does that mean about their outlook?\n\n33:15\n\nWhat does that mean about how they interact with each other?\n\n33:18\n\nAnd all of these things then go together to build up my sort of gestalt of how\nthat\n\n33:22\n\nparticular species will interact with the world and interact with people.\n\n33:27\n\nI saw this on your website that recently you announced you would no longer\n\n33:31\n\nrecognize your 2023 Hugo Award.\n\n33:34\n\nWhich was a voluntary ethical decision due to the disenfranchisement of\nChinese\n\n33:38\n\nvoters after works were left out of the competition for fear of causing\npolitical offense.\n\n33:44\n\nI've seen there's been a couple of resignations and committee changes.\n\n33:48\n\nHow do you feel about that situation now?\n\n33:50\n\nI have a lot of faith.\n\n33:52\n\nI mean,\n\n33:52\n\nI happen to know a fair number of people who were involved in this year's\n\n33:56\n\nGlasgow-based Worldcon,\n\n33:57\n\nobviously,\n\n33:57\n\nbecause it is in my backyard.\n\n34:00\n\nI have every faith that they're doing all that they can to remedy that.\n\n34:04\n\nAnd like you say,\n\n34:05\n\npeople who were involved in last year's decision are no longer in the picture\nfor\n\n34:09\n\nthis year's.\n\n34:10\n\nI hope that the problem with the Worldcon and the Hugos is each year there is\n\n34:15\n\npotentially a different group of people who are dealing with it,\n\n34:18\n\nalthough...\n\n34:19\n\nAlso,\n\n34:19\n\nI know the people involved in 23 have been in place in various configurations\nfor\n\n34:25\n\nquite a while and hopefully are no longer going to be given any kind of\nposition in\n\n34:30\n\nthat kind of decision making process,\n\n34:31\n\ngiven what happened.\n\n34:32\n\nI have every optimism that the whole process can be fixed and there can be\n\n34:40\n\nsafeguards put in place to stop something like this happening again.\n\n34:43\n\nIt's definitely a singular and unusual example of just people in power,\n\n34:50\n\nnot in any way following the rules that they were supposed to follow,\n\n34:53\n\nbut maybe just thinking that they had been in that position for long enough\nthat it\n\n34:57\n\nwas kind of their show and they could run it the way they wanted to run it.\n\n34:59\n\nI mean,\n\n34:59\n\nit's a situation one kind of...\n\n35:02\n\nGood lord,\n\n35:02\n\nI used to do amateur dramatics way back in the day,\n\n35:05\n\nand I sat in on some committee meetings,\n\n35:07\n\nand then you get the same kind of thing as there are people there who've been\n\n35:10\n\naround for a long time,\n\n35:12\n\nand they are kind of the institutional memory,\n\n35:14\n\nand it's all very fun and games up until the point that someone disagrees with\nthem.\n\n35:18\n\nAnd then you find out that it was kind of all sort of being run because they\n\n35:22\n\nthought that was the way it needed to be run and didn't really matter what any\nof\n\n35:26\n\nthe regulations said.\n\n35:27\n\nAnd...\n\n35:28\n\nThis is why it's weird,\n\n35:30\n\nbecause it sounds trivial when one is talking about something like this,\n\n35:33\n\nbut you do kind of need regulations that mean that excesses of personality\ndon't\n\n35:40\n\nstart tugging the whole thing into those kind of rather murky waters.\n\n35:45\n\nYeah, I thought it was a commendable move, and based on integrity, awards\nshould have integrity.\n\n35:52\n\nWell, yeah, I mean, it was...\n\n35:54\n\nIt had been rumbly along for a while.\n\n35:57\n\nI mean,\n\n35:58\n\nI wasn't even,\n\n35:59\n\nI should absolutely note,\n\n36:00\n\nI was not by any means the first person to take the step,\n\n36:04\n\neven.\n\n36:05\n\nBut it was specifically the fact that when it came out that one couldn't even\nrely\n\n36:09\n\non the shortlists genuinely reflecting the desires of the people who are\nentirely\n\n36:17\n\neligible and permitted to vote,\n\n36:19\n\nand that the decisions to...\n\n36:21\n\napparently get rid of a large number of votes had been taken with no\nregulation or\n\n36:28\n\nauthority behind them,\n\n36:29\n\nbut just at the whim of the people involved,\n\n36:30\n\nthen it was just,\n\n36:31\n\nwell,\n\n36:32\n\non that basis,\n\n36:33\n\nI couldn't even necessarily say I should have even been on the list to be\nvoted on,\n\n36:37\n\nlet alone win the thing.\n\n36:38\n\nSo that just seemed to be the only thing to do at that point.\n\n36:42\n\nDo you notice any differences in award culture in Britain compared to the rest\nof\n\n36:47\n\nthe world or Britain compared to America?\n\n36:50\n\nThe way these things work is every award is very much its own beast anyway.\n\n36:54\n\nSo even in America, the Hugos is different to the Locust Award, which is\ndifferent to the Nebula Award.\n\n36:59\n\ndetermined in different ways.\n\n37:00\n\nSome of them have juries.\n\n37:02\n\nSome of them are voted on by a very large number of people.\n\n37:05\n\nSome of them are voted on by a very small number of people.\n\n37:08\n\nI think every award has its own culture.\n\n37:11\n\nOne of the things you very quickly work out of the writer is every particular\naward,\n\n37:15\n\nthere are certain,\n\n37:16\n\nyou know,\n\n37:18\n\na particular book,\n\n37:18\n\nyou can think that's a good book for this award.\n\n37:20\n\nI would not be surprised if that book turns up on the shortlist for that award\n\n37:24\n\nbecause it just feels like the sort of award that will appeal\n\n37:27\n\nto the people who have a vote in that situation or the people who select that\nsituation.\n\n37:32\n\nThere is a sort of book you might think,\n\n37:35\n\nI feel this probably will get on the Clark's shortlist because it's a sort of\nbook\n\n37:39\n\nthat the Clark's judge is like.\n\n37:41\n\nThere's a sort of book you think,\n\n37:42\n\nwell,\n\n37:42\n\nmaybe this will be on the Hugo's shortlist because it's the sort of thing that\nthe\n\n37:45\n\nWorldCom members tend to go for.\n\n37:48\n\num yeah all of these awards have their own specific culture and the same is\nvery\n\n37:53\n\nmuch true yeah i i can feel there is a particular book that feels like a\nbritish\n\n37:57\n\nfantasy award nominee book and there is a particular that the british science\n\n38:01\n\nfiction award um similarly has its own particular slant and that's tends to be\nhow\n\n38:05\n\nit goes so i don't\n\n38:07\n\nI don't think necessarily it's a US-UK thing.\n\n38:10\n\nI think it's far more fragmented than that.\n\n38:13\n\nAnd I mean,\n\n38:14\n\nI don't know awards from the non-English language world,\n\n38:19\n\nbut I would be extremely surprised to find that wasn't the case with those as\nwell.\n\n38:23\n\nI think every single group of people voting will have a particular flavour to\nit.\n\n38:30\n\nAnd it's always going to be a bit cliquey, I guess.\n\n38:35\n\nI think I heard a joke or something that like British people don't like to win\n\n38:41\n\nawards and they also don't like to see other people win awards.\n\n38:47\n\nI mean, yeah, so maybe there's cultural differences there and like, you know,\nmovies and stuff, maybe in.\n\n38:53\n\nmovies are a very good example because i mean that everyone has heard the idea\nyou\n\n38:57\n\nknow that particular film comes out and someone said that film is oscar paid\nthat\n\n39:01\n\nfilm is there that film is specifically the people making that film were very\nmuch\n\n39:05\n\nthinking we would like to win an oscar for this film and it's exactly there\nare\n\n39:08\n\ncertain films you know what people i think people would have been inordinately\n\n39:11\n\nsurprised if oppenheimer had not been multiply nominated for oscars and that's\n\n39:16\n\nexactly the sort of thing i mean but obviously in a bit of a smaller scale\nright um\n\n39:21\n\nAll right, this one, I'm kind of getting near the end of my questions here.\n\n39:24\n\nThis one, parrots or corvids?\n\n39:27\n\nWhich one do you think has more potential for increasing intelligence and\ngaining\n\n39:32\n\nthe ability to tell stories?\n\n39:34\n\nThat is,\n\n39:35\n\nagain,\n\n39:36\n\nthat's another really tricky question because they are both,\n\n39:39\n\nthey really are both at the top of their game as far as intelligence goes.\n\n39:42\n\nSo just for people who are not sort of necessarily up on the research with\nintelligence,\n\n39:49\n\num obviously we you know parents are very good vocal mimics but also there\nhave\n\n39:54\n\nbeen experiments there with a parrot called alex which i which i dedicated um\n\n39:58\n\nchildren memory to which um was able to verbally sort of solve problems answer\n\n40:07\n\nquestions\n\n40:08\n\neven innovate in sort of word phrasing and things like that.\n\n40:13\n\nSo parents are genuinely enormously intelligent.\n\n40:18\n\nCorvids can adapt tools.\n\n40:21\n\nThey can learn observationally much more quickly than humans, honestly.\n\n40:25\n\nThey're extremely good at it.\n\n40:27\n\nwe have the big brain and that's what makes us intelligent and actually we're\n\n40:30\n\nlooking at a lot of species now and working actually the proportional size of\nthe\n\n40:34\n\nbrain doesn't seem to be quite quite as important as we think because birds\nhave\n\n40:37\n\nvery small brains they have um obviously if you're a flying bird you have an\n\n40:40\n\nenormous inherent weight limit and that means your brain can never get that\nbig but\n\n40:45\n\nbirds seem to do incredibly complicated things with their\n\n40:49\n\nrelatively small brains.\n\n40:50\n\nAnd we think actually maybe human brains are just very, very undisciplined in\nthe way they're organized.\n\n40:55\n\nAnd that may give us some of the things that make us human.\n\n40:59\n\nBecause there are certainly cognitive things going on in a human brain that\nother\n\n41:03\n\nspecies don't seem to have.\n\n41:05\n\nAnd it may simply be because we have this enormous excess of gray matter.\n\n41:12\n\nI think I would probably just about tip over to corvids because corvids seem\nto\n\n41:15\n\nhave a more practical intelligence.\n\n41:17\n\nand the tool using and so forth.\n\n41:19\n\nBut it's got to be a very close run thing.\n\n41:22\n\nThere's a bit of a flowering of animal behavioral study at the moment.\n\n41:26\n\nAnd one of the things that people tend to find is wherever you look,\n\n41:28\n\nthe animals are actually a lot smarter than we always thought they were.\n\n41:31\n\nYeah, for sure.\n\n41:32\n\nAnd yeah, for sure.\n\n41:34\n\nI thought that question kind of gets it to like,\n\n41:36\n\nparrots seem to have some grasp of that language and mimicry thing.\n\n41:39\n\nAnd corvids maybe have like a stronger social thing, you know, the group\ndynamics of\n\n41:45\n\nessentially that you tip it over to corvids that kind of had that same hunch.\n\n41:49\n\nAlthough there are a lot, I mean, parrots are very social animals.\n\n41:52\n\nThis is one thing about keeping lone parrots is actually a bit of a,\n\n41:55\n\nyou know,\n\n41:56\n\nI've certainly seen an advance that actually is maybe not the best thing to do\n\n41:58\n\nbecause parrots really need society.\n\n42:01\n\nAnd one of the reasons that parrots do interact a lot with humans is because\nthey\n\n42:04\n\nare kind of desperate for company.\n\n42:05\n\nAnd in the wild, parrots live in enormous colonies and they're very pushed for\nspace.\n\n42:11\n\nAnd that is one\n\n42:12\n\nThat seems to be one thing that is a big driver of intelligence,\n\n42:17\n\nis the fact that you just have to know where you stand with a large number of\nneighbours.\n\n42:22\n\nAnd so you get that social intelligence where you're like,\n\n42:24\n\nI can push around that parrot and that parrot I can't push around and that\nkind of thing.\n\n42:27\n\nThere's one thing they found with prairie dogs.\n\n42:30\n\nPrairie dogs seem to have an incredibly sophisticated language system.\n\n42:33\n\nAnd also prairie dogs have the ability to lie to other prairie dogs and things\nlike that,\n\n42:38\n\nwhich is just sort of hilarious.\n\n42:41\n\nBut they are able and they appear to be able to innovate so that they can\ndescribe\n\n42:46\n\nvery specific things to one another about what threats are around.\n\n42:50\n\nAnd again,\n\n42:50\n\nthey are creatures that live in a very large community,\n\n42:53\n\nvery closely packed in,\n\n42:55\n\nand they are very competitive within themselves.\n\n42:57\n\nAnd that's got to be a driver for a certain type of intelligence.\n\n43:02\n\nWhat's the difference between theory of mind and empathy?\n\n43:06\n\nAnd how would you make the case to a child that cooperation is better than\ndestructive competition?\n\n43:13\n\nI mean,\n\n43:14\n\nI guess if you have theory of mind but not empathy,\n\n43:17\n\nI guess you're probably somewhere on the sociopath scale,\n\n43:20\n\nI suppose.\n\n43:22\n\nBecause you understand in theory that other people think,\n\n43:28\n\nand that is in fact how you can manipulate them and get them to do things.\n\n43:32\n\nBut you don't necessarily feel for them or really register them as...\n\n43:36\n\nreal other entities in the world.\n\n43:39\n\nThey don't kind of show up on your mental map in that kind of way.\n\n43:43\n\nI mean,\n\n43:44\n\nas far as the child thing is,\n\n43:45\n\nit's fascinating because we have this idea of children as very,\n\n43:48\n\nvery kind of selfish and frequently they are.\n\n43:50\n\nBut it's my own sort of observation,\n\n43:54\n\ncertainly with my son growing up,\n\n43:56\n\nis that the empathy for others can be quite deep-rooted.\n\n44:01\n\nAnd frequently when we see children being selfish, it's because they don't\nnecessarily think ahead.\n\n44:06\n\nSo it's a matter of that being able to project your kind of prognosis of\nwhat's\n\n44:12\n\ngoing to happen if I do this just a little bit further into the future.\n\n44:16\n\nSo he's getting past that sort of immediate instant gratification sort of\nmoment.\n\n44:23\n\nAnd again, I mean, honestly, that feels like the human problem in miniature.\n\n44:26\n\nWe were talking about what would we have to change.\n\n44:29\n\nlooking at corporate behavior and shareholder profits,\n\n44:32\n\nlooking at what people are willing to burn down for short-term political gain.\n\n44:38\n\nAnd I'm talking about this specifically,\n\n44:40\n\nthis is very much the thing that is in the book I'm currently writing.\n\n44:44\n\nAnd it's where I'm talking about the idea,\n\n44:46\n\nwell,\n\n44:47\n\nall right,\n\n44:48\n\nif we actually start to live longer,\n\n44:51\n\nwhat happens if you get the selfish billionaire?\n\n44:54\n\nIt's not a major part of the book, but the selfish billionaire who...\n\n44:58\n\nhas themselves effectively made immortal by spending the GDP of a small\ncountry on\n\n45:03\n\non sort of gene surgery and so forth and then are they still being the selfish\n\n45:08\n\nbillionaire 150 years later or have they started to realize well actually I\nyou\n\n45:12\n\nknow I have done a certain amount of sewing but I've done a hell of a lot of\n\n45:16\n\nreaping and maybe I should start to take less sort of short-term self-absorbed\n\n45:22\n\ndecisions because I'm going to have to live with the consequences\n\n45:25\n\nit's often said that we as a species are not set up for long-term thinking\nbecause\n\n45:29\n\nyeah the problems of say climate change are longer than human lifespan but\nhonestly\n\n45:33\n\nwe're set up for much long much better long-term thinking than is frequently\n\n45:37\n\nexhibited by people calling the shots in the world whose thinking seems to go\nno\n\n45:42\n\nfurther than three months the year in the future um yeah we are quite capable\nof\n\n45:47\n\nplanning of planting trees to shade our descendants as i think one of the uh\n\n45:51\n\nclassic examples is so yes it's it's it's just a matter of i think\nunfortunately\n\n45:57\n\none of the other things about how the way we adults all children um interact\nwith\n\n46:02\n\nthe world they can be hacked very easily by people who have that theory of\nmind and\n\n46:07\n\nmaybe don't have that empathy just to to try desperately to bring it back to\nthe\n\n46:12\n\nactual question you asked me\n\n46:15\n\nI thought you did such a nice job.\n\n46:16\n\nYou sort of addressed that question, I thought, at the end of Children of\nTime.\n\n46:23\n\nBut I just want to thank you so much for taking time to speak with me today.\n\n46:25\n\nI hope we can do this again in the future.\n\n46:28\n\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n46:29\n\nBut feel free to drop me a line.\n\n46:32\n\nThank you very much.\n\n46:32\n\nBye.\n\n46:36\n\nAdrian Tchaikovsky's latest book is Alien Clay.\n\n46:41\n\nHis next book, Service Model, will be out in June.\n\n46:44\n\nYou can find a link to his website and other footnotes from our conversation\nin the\n\n46:50\n\nblog post for this podcast episode at ryanblakely.net.\n\n46:56\n\nThank you for listening.\n\nWhat if a spider was the size of a cat? Abandoning Earth to live in deep space\nwould start to make sense.\n\nMy guest today is a science fiction writer whose novel Children of Time is a\nstory with rapidly evolving spiders, ants that can clear a forest, and a\ndesperate crew of humanity\u2019s last survivors.\n\nHe often writes stories with an interest in animal worlds, which have won\nseveral awards including the 2016 Arthur C. Clarke Award and the 2023 Hugo\nAward.\n\nHis latest book is Alien Clay, and his next book Service Model will be out in\nJune.\n\nWe spoke about spider ecology, science fiction, and British people's distaste\nfor awards, in March 2024.\n\nRyan: You've said before that something you\u2019re shooting for, as a fiction\nauthor, is a world that feels real and is bigger than the book. How does that\nshape the early stages of a writing project?\n\nAdrian: For me, the world always comes first. I get immersed in the world to\nunderstand how it works, and from that the characters and the story arise.\n\nI always wanted to present environments and creatures, and I use the story and\ncharacters as a vehicle to do that. It is a backwards way of doing things\ncompared to many authors. But I want people who are reading my books to feel\nthey are reading about a place that has an existence beyond the specific\ncircumstance and people they\u2019re meeting.\n\nRyan: You have a lot of interesting non-human characters in your stories. How\ndo you decide which aspects of an animal's ecology or behavior you want to\nincorporate?\n\nAdrian: My starting point is frequently the sensorium. If you know how a\ncreature apprehends the world, that tells you a lot about how it thinks, what\nis important to it, what it will react to, and you can build out from that.\nIt's a starting point to get out of a human mindset.\n\nWith the spiders in Children of Time, or the octopuses in Children of Ruin,\nthe sensorium is a big part of it. I research the species, find people to talk\nto, or books that are geared toward the moderately interested layman.\n\nI learn about features of the life cycle, what we understand of the cognition\nor behavior, and each feature is like a stone dropped into a pool, it ripples\nand I see where it goes.\n\nWhat does it mean about their problem-solving, their outlook, or how they\ninteract with each other?\n\nRyan: I liked the phrase \"measuring legs\". Could you describe what that meant?\n\nAdrian: \"Measuring legs\" is in my book Children of Time. It's the spider-\nequivalent of a dick-measuring contest.\n\nThere are spider mating and threat displays that involve raising the legs, so\nyou're getting a sense of the size and physical power of the other spider by\nhow energetic it is, how big the legs are, and the span.\n\nAs the society goes on they don't do that physically, but it becomes a watch-\nword for someone trying to throw their weight around and show you how\nimportant they are.\n\nIt's based on real spider behavior.\n\nRyan: The largest fossil spider was half the size of its modern relative. What\ndo you think about the constraints that keep spiders small? Is it a\ncoincidence of evolution that they haven't had larger bodies?\n\nAdrian: It's fascinating that we live in the age of giant spiders right now.\n\nThere was a point when we thought there was a very large Carboniferous spider\nwhich has been re-interpreted as a marine scorpion.1\n\nIn the Carboniferous there were very large arthropods going about. There was a\nmillipede, Arthropleura, about 6 foot long. We know it was land-bound because\nwe have tracks and partial fossils. We know they could get very big.\n\nIt's not the simple fact of having an exoskeleton or ways of breathing that\nare the hard limiters for spider size.\n\nWhy wasn't there a big spider? Maybe there was and we haven't found it, or\nmaybe there was never one because the spider lifestyle precluded it.\n\nI talk about in Children of Time how spiders have book lungs, which are a more\nefficient respiration system than insects. And insects certainly got very\nlarge in the Carboniferous period.\n\nIt's possible early spiders moved on to web spinning, and presumably there is\na limit to how big you can get and sit on a web.\n\nBut we haven't found a fossil spider as big as the modern bird-eating spider\nor Goliath spider. It's a fascinating point of paleontology because there are\nclose relatives like scorpions that got very big.\n\nRyan: With the technology of silk it seems like they would have had an\nopportunity for success and gotten big.\n\nAdrian: You have to remember that getting big doesn't necessarily equate to\nsuccess. There's some kind of biological mechanism, where if things have a\nclear run at getting big, they do so, and it is possibly because of things\nlike breeding success.\n\nSize is frequently related with perceived fitness. If you can physically shut\nyour rivals out of the way, as happened with a lot of beetle species. But\nbeing big has a lot of disadvantages. It's energetically costly. It\npotentially makes you more vulnerable to predation because you can't hide as\nwell.\n\nIf you look at insects, you realize very quickly being big does not mean\nsuccess. Frequently insects are successful because they're not big.\n\nRyan: What were you like as a kid?\n\nAdrian: It wasn't something people were saying at the time, but I was probably\nquite severely autistic. I did not get on with people. I had enormously strong\nfascinations. I was repeatedly told by teachers and primary school that if I\ntried to drag spiders into everything, I would never get anywhere in life,\nwhich is advice that I thankfully ignored.\n\nI was a huge sci-fi buff. I loved Doctor Who. I loved Star Wars. I was like a\nlot of science-fiction fans and writers. Around the age of 13, I got into\nrole-playing games, another common hobby for writers of my generation. I never\nstopped playing them since. I'm in three active games at the moment.\n\nRyan: Do you think humans are the only animal that imagines fictitious\ncreatures? Is that tied to our facility of language and story-telling, or\ncould it be tied to dreams?\n\nAdrian: That's a fascinating question. Well, obviously we can't know. I like\nto think that level of imagination evolved earlier, and that it isn't\nnecessarily tied to language.\n\nWhen you bring language into the mix, you're able to communicate your\nimaginings to others. And in that conversation, build upon it, so that your\nimaginative life becomes a lot richer.\n\nDreams are not simply the replaying of memories. There is an imaginative\nelement to dreams. A lot of animals seem to have dream-like experiences, as we\nsee from brain activity, including jumping spiders.2\n\nJumping spiders have a mobile eye component. They have very advanced eyes for\nspiders. We see eye movement during REM-like sleep.\n\nIf you're seeing a thing in a dream, you are kind of imagining a fictitious\nthing. Whatever sense they're using in dreams go beyond simply recreating a\nthing that exists in the real world...I don't know.\n\nThe possibility would seem to be inherent in the experience of dreaming. You\ncan go beyond the bounds of reality because you're not simply replaying your\nactual memories.\n\nFor species with a simpler cognition, dreaming may be little more than what we\nwould feel as very unformed experiences.\n\nWe may never know, but I think it's inherent in the nature of dreams that some\nconfabulation is going on.\n\nRyan: What's an animal that you would bring back from extinction?\n\nAdrian: Mammoths are the classic one. If a mammoth is anything like an\nelephant, and we have reason to believe it is, elephants are social creatures.\nIf elephants became extinct, and then you re-create an elephant, which we\ncould probably do that, it isn't really an elephant because elephants are a\nproduct of generational society and learning going back thousands of years.\n\nIf you wipe out elephants and then bring back an elephant or even some\nelephants it would be like some aliens come along and just re-create a bunch\nof people from genetic samples. The culture would be missing.\n\nRichard Attenborough's aim in Jurassic Park is basically banal entertainment\nthat owes nothing to any kind of real spirit of science. It's just like, \"hey\nwe've got a mammoth\" and then five minutes later everyone has seen the mammoth\nand nobody cares.\n\nRyan: If somebody gave you the big red button to push to bring back something\nfrom the past 10 million years are you leaning towards not pressing it?\n\nAdrian: If somebody gave me the big red button for Jaekelopterus, the 8 foot\nsea scorpion, to fill the ocean with those, I'm not sure I'd be able to\nrestrain myself. But I don't think it would be a good idea.\n\nI'm certainly not immune to bad ideas.\n\nRyan: Are there any rare old books you've drawn inspiration from?\n\nAdrian: I've got a Dune special edition on my shelf. I don't generally get\nahold of antique books.\n\nAn old fascinating book is the Voynich manuscript. It remains a complete\nenigma. This is a book from the 1400s.3 It's this big fully illustrated tomb\nthat's completely incomprehensible. It's written in a nonsense alphabet. It\nhas all these bizarre pseudo alchemical looking illustrations. Nobody knows if\nit is an elaborate joke or whether it's encoded language or what is going on.\nNew theories pop up every so often about what the voyage manuscript is.\n\nEither it means something, even if it just means this nonsense alchemy that\ndoesn't work, or is this phenomenal practical joke that someone must have\nspent years over. And there was kind of a market at the time. People were very\nmuch into various kinds of occult studies and sciences. So quite possibly\nmaking a nonsense book and then selling it for thousands of duckets or\nwhatever would have been a worthwhile venture.\n\nBut we don't know.\n\nRyan: We recently flew past the Turing test with ChatGPT. Do you think scaling\nup large language models could summon an artificial general intelligence?\n\nAdrian: Pretty definitively no. It's a pattern mimicking machine. There's\nnothing in the functioning that leaves room for a self to develop.\n\nIt kind of makes me despair that we are calling these things AIs. In science\nfiction AI has been like Data from Star Trek, someone who is very logical,\nrooted in truth and accuracy, and rather confused by vibe.\n\nWhat you get out of a language models is all vibe and very little recognition\nof truth or meaning. And that's a problem because people are using AI to\nproduce what should be factual books.\n\nA famous one a little while ago was a guide to edible mushrooms entirely AI\ngenerated. You can't do a mushroom guide with AI. You'll get people killed.\n\nIt doesn't care whether the information is true. It cares whether it looks\nlike the sort of thing that would be in a guide to mushrooms.\n\nRyan: How do you think about humanity\u2019s existential risk or the risk of being\nknocked back to the Stone Age, and what we need to change in the world to make\nyou feel more optimistic about our chances not crashing in the next century?\n\nAdrian: Human nature. Our attitude towards leadership. We\u2019re easily hijacked\nby a narrow group of people with a profound interest in maintaining the status\nquo because it will give them a bump in profits in the next quarter, who don't\ncare what happens in five years time, or believe their power and money will\ninsulate them.\n\nWe have the technology to sort ourselves out.\n\nWhat we need is government not deeply concerned about the profits of the\nfossil fuel industry and the other industries that are causing problems. We\nneed a more science\u2013led approach.\n\nI don't think we're going to get it, but I think it's doable. If we fail to\nsave ourselves, and we do end up back in the Stone Age, we only have ourselves\nto blame.\n\nRyan: It's interesting the relationships people have with a ship, like a life\nraft, a refuge, but also a trap. If you had to live in a submarine, an Arctic\nresearch station, a desert tunnel, colony, or a space colony, which one are\nyou signing up for?\n\nAdrian: I think space would be the most challenging. I would be hopeless in\nzero gravity. I suspect I would be best off in the arctic because I'm not\nparticularly fond of hot weather.\n\nIt comes down to people. You need to choose your neighbors. I could live\nanywhere, but if the person in the next room was fond of blasting loud music\nall the time that would drive me crazy, far more than just being in the\nAntarctic.\n\nRyan: An alien spaceship has arrived on Earth and requested to speak with you.\nAfter getting dressed and having a meal, you have 30 minutes to prepare. A\nhelicopter is on its way to pick you up. How would you prepare for first\ncontact?\n\nAdrian: I do not subscribe to the human-like alien idea, which is beloved by\nsome sci-fi writers and philosophers. I don't subscribe to the philanthropic\ntheory, that the universe is kind of geared up by its mechanisms to produce\nhuman-like life.\n\nAnything that has evolved on another world would be more alien to us than\nanything we know on earth.\n\nIf it's got a spaceship, then it's presumably got a fairly advanced concept of\nhow physics works, how the universe works. You'd have some overlap in outlook\non that basis.\n\nI\u2019d study the cliff notes for particle physics, and how stars work,\nastrophysics primers so we'd have something that we're both familiar with to\ntalk about.\n\nWhen sending for me in a situation like that, I guess they're probably\nspiders.\n\nOther than that, just an open mind because aliens are going to be alien.\n\nI think the closest we've got to it in film is probably arrival, the\nadaptation of the Ted Jones story. Because the aliens in that are gloriously\nalien. Both physically and in outlook.\n\nRyan: Do you have a ritual when you're writing like going for a walk?\n\nAdrian: Breaking the routine, going on a journey, even just spending the night\naway from home, these things have served to unlock the imagination. Usually\nthere\u2019s a problem I\u2019m working on, where I need a change of surroundings to\nhelp me fix.\n\nWhen I'm away from home there are fewer distractions, and more my mind can be\noccupied with the problem.\n\nOnce I've had a bit of interaction with the alien species, that would be the\ntime to get away, have a bit of a head clearing.\n\nI tend to need to find answers for myself, which is a sort of neurodivergent\ntrait I have. But for a writer, that's probably a useful way of going about\nthings.\n\nRyan: On your website you recently announced you would no longer recognize\nyour 2023 Hugo award due to the disenfranchisement of Chinese voters after\nworks were left out of the competition for fear of causing political offense.4\nThere have been a couple resignations and committee changes. How do you feel\nabout that situation now?\n\nAdrian: I have every faith that they are doing all they can to to remedy that.\nPeople who were involved in last year's decision are no longer in the picture.\n\nIt's definitely a singular and unusual example of people not following the\nrules they were supposed to follow. Maybe they were thinking they had been in\nthat position long enough that it was their show to run the way they wanted.\n\nI used to do amateur dramas, and I sat in on committee meetings, and you get\nthe same kind of thing there. There are people who have been around a long\ntime and are the institutional memory, and it's all fun and games until\nsomeone disagrees with them.\n\nRegulations are supposed to keep the excesses of personality from tugging the\nwhole thing into murky waters.\n\nI wasn\u2019t the first to take action, but it was specifically when it came out\nthat one couldn't rely on the shortlists to genuinely reflect the desires of\nthe people who were eligible and permitted to vote...the decisions to get rid\nof a large number of votes at the whim of the people involved. On that basis,\nI couldn't say that I should've been on the list to be voted on, let alone win\nthe thing. So [rejecting it] seemed to be the only thing to do at that point.\n\nRyan: I heard a joke that British people don't like to win awards, and they\nalso don't like to see other people win awards.\n\nRyan: Parrots or corvids. Which one do you think is closer to gaining the\nability to tell stories?\n\nAdrian: That's a tricky question because they are both at the top of their\ngame as far as intelligence goes. Parrots are very good vocal mimics. I\ndedicated Children of Memory to a parrot called Alex, who was able to verbally\nsolve problems, answer questions, and even innovate word phrasing. Parrots are\nenormously intelligent.\n\nCorvids can adapt tools. They can learn observationally more quickly than\nhumans.\n\nBirds have very small brains. A flying bird has an inherent weight limit, and\nthat means the brain can never get too big. But birds seem to do incredibly\ncomplicated things with their relatively small brains.\n\nMaybe human brains are really just undisciplined in the way they're organized.\nAnd that may give us some of the things that make us human. Because there are\ncertainly cognitive things going on in a human brain that other species don't\nseem to have, and it may be because we have this enormous excess of gray\nmatter.\n\nI think I would just about tip over to Corvids because they seem to have a\nmore practical intelligence, and tool using. But it's gotta be a close run.\n\nThere's a bit of a flowering of animal behavioral study at the moment. One of\nthe things that people tend to find is wherever you look, the animals tend to\nbe a little smarter than we thought.\n\nParrots are very social animals. That\u2019s one thing about keeping lone parrots.\nThat's actually maybe not the best thing to do because parents really need\nsociety.\n\nOne reason parrots interact a lot with humans is because they are kind of\ndesperate for company. In the wild they live in enormous colonies and they're\nvery pushed for space. That seems to be one of the big drivers of\nintelligence, the fact that you have to know where you stand with a very large\nnumber of neighbors, social intelligence. I can push around that guy, but I\ncan't push him around, and that kind of thing.\n\nThat's one thing they found with prairie dogs. They seem to have an incredibly\nsophisticated language system. They have the ability to lie to other prairie\ndogs, which is hilarious. They can describe very specific things to one\nanother about what threats are around. And again they are creatures that live\nin very large community groups, closely packed in, and they are very\ncompetitive within their group, and that's got to be a driver for a certain\ntype of intelligence.\n\nRyan: Do you have a favorite example of ecology in science-fiction, from\nanother author?\n\nAdrian: Sue Burke's Semiosis has an ecology that is dominated by interrelated\nsapience, that to a human viewpoint, is plant life. The whole ecology is being\nrun by the plants in this enormous interconnected community.5\n\nRyan: What is the difference between theory of mind and empathy? How do you\nencourage a child to be cooperative?\n\nAdrian: I suppose if you have theory of mind and not empathy you\u2019re somewhere\non the sociopath scale. You understand in-theory that other people think, and\nthat is how you manipulate them. But you don't feel for them or register them\nas real, other entities in the world. They\u2019re a shell in your mental map.\n\nWe have this idea of children as selfish, and frequently they are. But my own\nobservation with my son growing up is that empathy for other can be quite deep\nrooted.\n\nFrequently when we see children being selfish, it is because they don't think\nahead. It's a matter of being able to project cause and effect further into\nthe future, getting past immediate gratification.\n\nThat feels like the human problem in miniature. We talked about what we have\nto change. Corporate behavior. What people are willing to burn down for short\nterm political gain.\n\nThis is in my current book I'm writing. If we start to live longer, what\nhappens if you get the selfish billionaire who has effectively made themselves\nimmortal by spending the GDP of a small country on gene surgery and so forth.\n\nAre they still the selfish billionaire a hundred and fifty years later, or\nhave they started to realize, \u201cI\u2019ve done a certain amount of sewing, but I've\ndone a hell of a lot of reaping. Maybe I should make fewer short-term\ndecisions because I'm going to have to live with the consequences.\n\nIt's often said that we as a species are not set up for long-term thinking,\nthe problems of climate change are longer than a human life span.\n\nBut we're setup for much better long-term thinking than is frequently\nexhibited by people calling shots in the world. We are quite capable of\nplanting trees to shade our descendants.\n\nRyan: Thank you so much taking time to talk today.\n\nAdrian: Thank you very much.\n\nAdrian Tchaikovsky\u2019s latest book is Alien Clay, and his next book Service\nModel will be out in June.
