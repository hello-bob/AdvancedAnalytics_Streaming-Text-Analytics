Hawkins, transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who\ncovers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The\nNew York Daily News and City & State.\n\nApr 25, 2024, 2:39 PM UTC\n\n## Share this story\n\nImage: Ford\n\nFord is the No. 2 seller of electric vehicles in the US. It\u2019s very proud of\nthat fact, but the amount of cash it had to burn to get there is enough to\nmake you wonder whether it can keep that title.\n\nThe company reported its first quarter earnings last night, and woo boy, it\u2019s\nrough\n\nThe company reported its first quarter earnings last night, and woo boy, it\u2019s\nrough. Ford said it lost $1.3 billion on the sale of 10,000 electric vehicles\nin the first three months of the year \u2014 a staggering figure that amounts to\n$130,000 lost for every EV sold.\n\nFord\u2019s Model e division, which oversees some of the company\u2019s EV sales as well\nas software, reported $100 million in revenue, an 84 percent drop from the\nsame period last year. The number of vehicles sold (10,000) was also down from\nthe first quarter of 2023 by 20 percent. Ford blamed \u201cpricing pressure\u201d \u2014\nmostly driven by Tesla\u2019s rampant price cuts \u2014 and \u201cslower growth\u201d as customers\nhave cooled on electric vehicles.\n\nTo be sure, Ford Model e doesn\u2019t handle all the company\u2019s EV business. Ford\nPro, its commercial division, also sells electric F-150 Lightning trucks and\nE-Transit vans. Earlier this month, Ford said it sold a cumulative 20,232 EVs\nduring the first quarter, which was an 86 percent increase over Q1 2023 but a\n22 percent drop compared to the previous quarter.\n\nFord lost $1.3 billion on the sale of 10,000 electric vehicles\n\nSo what\u2019s going to staunch the bleeding? For one, the company plans to spend\nless than it previously said it would \u2014 to the tune of $8 or $9 billion,\nrather than $10 billion.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll probably be on the low end of that range,\u201d Ford CEO Jim Farley said in\na call with investors. \u201cAnd we\u2019re being very consistent about our discipline\non profitability.\u201d\n\nAnother thing it says will help bring its EV business into balance is new\ntechnologies, like \u201cnew battery chemistry and formats to substantially reduce\nthe cost of the batteries for that vehicle.\u201d\n\nThese include a lithium iron phosphate chemistry that Ford says is more\ndurable, faster charging, and more affordable than its current lineup of EVs,\nwhich largely rely on nickel cobalt manganese (NCM) chemistries.\n\nFord has been developing these new chemistries with China\u2019s Contemporary\nAmperex Technology Co., Limited (CATL), a global producer of EV batteries \u2014\nthough the automaker stressed that it will own and operate the plant outright\nthrough its wholly owned subsidiary and that the Chinese company will only\nprovide \u201cknowledge and services.\u201d Initial production is expected to commence\nin 2026.\n\nAnd earlier today, CATL announced major progress in its development of LFP\nbatteries, unveiling a new pack capable of adding 370 miles (600 km) range in\n10 minutes.\n\nAnother major bet is on Ford\u2019s Silicon Valley-based skunkworks group, which is\nbeing led by ex-Tesla executive Alan Clarke. These designers are working on a\nnext-generation platform of smaller, more affordable EVs, which Ford is\nbetting will be a big help in winning over urban dwellers.\n\n\u201cWe believe that\u2019s where the adoption of EV will grow the fastest,\u201d Farley\nsaid of city residents. \u201cAnd we believe we can compete in segments of small\ncars and vehicles, more affordable vehicles in a unique way that\u2019s Ford.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind, this is the same company that discontinued all of its sedans and\nhatchbacks six years ago in favor of building big SUVs and trucks, concluding\nthat larger vehicles would drive bigger profit margins.\n\nThey did \u2014 and still do today. Ford\u2019s gas-guzzling SUVs (Escape, Explorer,\nExpedition, and Bronco) had a historic quarter, which the company is calling\nits \u201call-time best.\u201d The company sold 216,997 SUVs \u2014 up 15 percent over last\nyear.\n\nSedans like the Ford Focus, Fiesta, and Fusion were money losers \u2014 much like\nthe Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning are today. For the company to say that\nsmaller, more affordable cars will be its salvation from future losses is a\nlittle ironic.\n\nMost Popular\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1. ## I traded in my MacBook and now I\u2019m a desktop convert\n\n  2. ## The walls of Apple\u2019s garden are tumbling down\n\n  3. ## How to delete the data Google has on you\n\n  4. ## BlizzCon 2024 has been canceled\n\n  5. ## DJI might get banned next in the US\n\nFrom our sponsor\n\nAdvertiser Content From\n\n## More from Transpo\n\n  * ### Tesla\u2019s Autopilot is under investigation again following \u2018recall\u2019 software update\n\n  * ### Tesla\u2019s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving linked to hundreds of crashes, dozens of deaths\n\n  * ### All the news about EV charging in the US\n\n  * ### Anyone want to buy TikTok?\n\n  * Advertiser Content From\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n  * How We Rate and Review Products\n\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Jobs @ Vox Media\n\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
