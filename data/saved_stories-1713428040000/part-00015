\u2013 6 January 1884) was an Austrian-Czech^[4] biologist,\nmeteorologist,^[5] mathematician, Augustinian friar and abbot of St. Thomas'\nAbbey in Brno (Br\u00fcnn), Margraviate of Moravia. Mendel was born in a German-\nspeaking family in the Silesian part of the Austrian Empire (today's Czech\nRepublic) and gained posthumous recognition as the founder of the modern\nscience of genetics.^[6] Though farmers had known for millennia that\ncrossbreeding of animals and plants could favor certain desirable traits,\nMendel's pea plant experiments conducted between 1856 and 1863 established\nmany of the rules of heredity, now referred to as the laws of Mendelian\ninheritance.^[7]\n\nMendel worked with seven characteristics of pea plants: plant height, pod\nshape and color, seed shape and color, and flower position and color. Taking\nseed color as an example, Mendel showed that when a true-breeding yellow pea\nand a true-breeding green pea were cross-bred their offspring always produced\nyellow seeds. However, in the next generation, the green peas reappeared at a\nratio of 1 green to 3 yellow. To explain this phenomenon, Mendel coined the\nterms \"recessive\" and \"dominant\" in reference to certain traits. In the\npreceding example, the green trait, which seems to have vanished in the first\nfilial generation, is recessive and the yellow is dominant. He published his\nwork in 1866, demonstrating the actions of invisible \"factors\"\u2014now called\ngenes\u2014in predictably determining the traits of an organism.\n\nThe profound significance of Mendel's work was not recognized until the turn\nof the 20th century (more than three decades later) with the rediscovery of\nhis laws. Erich von Tschermak, Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns independently\nverified several of Mendel's experimental findings in 1900, ushering in the\nmodern age of genetics.^[8]^[9]\n\n## Early life and education\n\nMendel was born into a German-speaking family in Heinzendorf bei Odrau,^[2] in\nSilesia, Austrian Empire (now Hyn\u010dice in the Czech Republic).^[6] He was the\nson of Anton and Rosine (Schwirtlich) Mendel and had one older sister,\nVeronika, and one younger, Theresia. They lived and worked on a farm which had\nbeen owned by the Mendel family for at least 130 years^[10] (the house where\nMendel was born is now a museum devoted to Mendel).^[11] During his childhood,\nMendel worked as a gardener and studied beekeeping. As a young man, he\nattended gymnasium in Troppau (Czech: Opava). He had to take four months off\nduring his gymnasium studies due to illness.^[12] From 1840 to 1843, he\nstudied practical and theoretical philosophy and physics at the Philosophical\nInstitute of the University of Olomouc (German: Olm\u00fctz), taking another year\noff because of illness. He also struggled financially to pay for his studies,\nand Theresia gave him her dowry. Later he helped support her three sons, two\nof whom became doctors.^[13]\n\nHe became a monk in part because it enabled him to obtain an education without\nhaving to pay for it himself.^[14] As the son of a struggling farmer, the\nmonastic life, in his words, spared him the \"perpetual anxiety about a means\nof livelihood.\"^[15] Born Johann Mendel, he was given the name Gregor (\u0158eho\u0159\nin Czech)^[2] when he joined the Order of Saint Augustine.^[16]\n\n## Academic career\n\nMendel (seated second from right and numbered \"2\") with other faculty at the\nBrno Realschule in 1864 (Alexander Zawadzki is labelled \"1\".)\n\nWhen Mendel entered the Faculty of Philosophy, the Department of Natural\nHistory and Agriculture was headed by Johann Karl Nestler who conducted\nextensive research of hereditary traits of plants and animals, especially\nsheep. Upon recommendation of his physics teacher Friedrich Franz,^[17] Mendel\nentered the Augustinian St Thomas's Abbey in Brno and began his training as a\npriest. Mendel worked as a substitute high school teacher. In 1850, he failed\nthe oral part, the last of three parts, of his exams to become a certified\nhigh school teacher. In 1851, he was sent to the University of Vienna to study\nunder the sponsorship of Abbot Cyril Franti\u0161ek Napp so that he could get more\nformal education.^[16] At Vienna, his professor of physics was Christian\nDoppler.^[18] Mendel returned to his abbey in 1853 as a teacher, principally\nof physics. In 1854 he met Aleksander Zawadzki who encouraged his research in\nBrno. In 1856, he took the exam to become a certified teacher and again failed\nthe oral part.^[19] In 1867, he replaced Napp as abbot of the monastery.^[20]\n\nAfter he was elevated as abbot in 1868, his scientific work largely ended, as\nMendel became overburdened with administrative responsibilities, especially a\ndispute with the civil government over its attempt to impose special taxes on\nreligious institutions.^[21] Mendel died on 6 January 1884, at the age of 61,\nin Brno,^[2] from chronic nephritis. Czech composer Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek played the\norgan at his funeral. After his death, the succeeding abbot burned all papers\nin Mendel's collection, to mark an end to the disputes over taxation.^[22] The\nexhumation of Mendel's corpse in 2021 delivered some physiognomic details like\nbody height (168 cm (66 in)). His genome was analysed, revealing that Mendel\nwas predisposed to heart problems.^[23]\n\n## Contributions\n\n### Experiments on plant hybridization\n\nMain article: Mendelian inheritance\n\nDominant and recessive phenotypes. (1) Parental generation. (2) F1 generation.\n(3) F2 generation.\n\nMendel, known as the \"father of modern genetics\", chose to study variation in\nplants in his monastery's 2 hectares (4.9 acres) experimental garden.^[24]\nMendel was assisted in his experimental design by Aleksander Zawadzki while\nhis superior abbot Napp wrote to discourage him, saying that the Bishop\ngiggled when informed of the detailed genealogies of peas.^[25]\n\nAfter initial experiments with pea plants, Mendel settled on studying seven\ntraits that seemed to be inherited independently of other traits: seed shape,\nflower color, seed coat tint, pod shape, unripe pod color, flower location,\nand plant height. He first focused on seed shape, which was either angular or\nround.^[26] Between 1856 and 1863 Mendel cultivated and tested some 28,000\nplants, the majority of which were pea plants (Pisum sativum).^[27]^[28]^[29]\nThis study showed that, when true-breeding different varieties were crossed to\neach other (e.g., tall plants fertilized by short plants), in the second\ngeneration, one in four pea plants had purebred recessive traits, two out of\nfour were hybrids, and one out of four were purebred dominant. His experiments\nled him to make two generalizations, the Law of Segregation and the Law of\nIndependent Assortment, which later came to be known as Mendel's Laws of\nInheritance.^[30]\n\n#### Initial reception of Mendel's work\n\nMendel presented his paper, Versuche \u00fcber Pflanzenhybriden (\"Experiments on\nPlant Hybridization\"), at two meetings of the Natural History Society of Brno\nin Moravia on 8 February and 8 March 1865.^[31] It generated a few favorable\nreports in local newspapers,^[29] but was ignored by the scientific community.\nWhen Mendel's paper was published in 1866 in Verhandlungen des\nnaturforschenden Vereines in Br\u00fcnn,^[32] it was seen as essentially about\nhybridization rather than inheritance, had little impact, and was cited only\nabout three times over the next thirty-five years. His paper was criticized at\nthe time, but is now considered a seminal work.^[33] Notably, Charles Darwin\nwas not aware of Mendel's paper, and it is envisaged that if he had been aware\nof it, genetics as it exists now might have taken hold much earlier.^[34]^[35]\nMendel's scientific biography thus provides an example of the failure of\nobscure, highly original innovators to receive the attention they\ndeserve.^[36]\n\n#### Rediscovery of Mendel's work\n\nAbout forty scientists listened to Mendel's two groundbreaking lectures, but\nit would appear that they failed to understand the implications of his work.\nLater, he also carried on a correspondence with Carl N\u00e4geli, one of the\nleading biologists of the time, but N\u00e4geli too failed to appreciate Mendel's\ndiscoveries. At times, Mendel must have entertained doubts about his work, but\nnot always: \"My time will come,\" he reportedly told a friend,^[15] Gustav von\nNiessl.^[37]\n\nDuring Mendel's lifetime, most biologists held the idea that all\ncharacteristics were passed to the next generation through blending\ninheritance (indeed, many effectively are), in which the traits from each\nparent are averaged.^[38]^[39] Instances of this phenomenon are now explained\nby the action of multiple genes with quantitative effects. Charles Darwin\ntried unsuccessfully to explain inheritance through a theory of pangenesis. It\nwas not until the early 20th century that the importance of Mendel's ideas was\nrealized.^[29]\n\nBy 1900, research aimed at finding a successful theory of discontinuous\ninheritance rather than blending inheritance led to independent duplication of\nhis work by Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns, and the rediscovery of Mendel's\nwritings and laws. Both acknowledged Mendel's priority, and it is thought\nprobable that de Vries did not understand the results he had found until after\nreading Mendel.^[29] Though Erich von Tschermak was originally also credited\nwith rediscovery, this is no longer accepted because he did not understand\nMendel's laws.^[40] Though de Vries later lost interest in Mendelism, other\nbiologists started to establish modern genetics as a science. All three of\nthese researchers, each from a different country, published their rediscovery\nof Mendel's work within a two-month span in the spring of 1900.^[41]\n\nMendel's results were quickly replicated, and genetic linkage quickly worked\nout. Biologists flocked to the theory; even though it was not yet applicable\nto many phenomena, it sought to give a genotypic understanding of heredity\nwhich they felt was lacking in previous studies of heredity, which had focused\non phenotypic approaches.^[42] Most prominent of these previous approaches was\nthe biometric school of Karl Pearson and W. F. R. Weldon, which was based\nheavily on statistical studies of phenotype variation. The strongest\nopposition to this school came from William Bateson, who perhaps did the most\nin the early days of publicising the benefits of Mendel's theory (the word\n\"genetics\", and much of the discipline's other terminology, originated with\nBateson). This debate between the biometricians and the Mendelians was\nextremely vigorous in the first two decades of the 20th century, with the\nbiometricians claiming statistical and mathematical rigor,^[43] whereas the\nMendelians claimed a better understanding of biology.^[44]^[45] Modern\ngenetics shows that Mendelian heredity is in fact an inherently biological\nprocess, though not all genes of Mendel's experiments are yet\nunderstood.^[46]^[47]\n\nIn the end, the two approaches were combined, especially by work conducted by\nR. A. Fisher as early as 1918. The combination, in the 1930s and 1940s, of\nMendelian genetics with Darwin's theory of natural selection resulted in the\nmodern synthesis of evolutionary biology.^[48]^[49]\n\nIn the Soviet Union and China, Mendelian genetics was rejected in favor of\nLamarckism, leading to imprisonment and even execution of Mendelian\ngeneticists (see Lysenkoism).\n\n### Other experiments\n\nMendel began his studies on heredity using mice. He was at St. Thomas's Abbey\nbut his bishop did not like one of his friars studying animal sex, so Mendel\nswitched to plants.^[50] Mendel also bred bees in a bee house that was built\nfor him, using bee hives that he designed.^[51]^[52] He also studied astronomy\nand meteorology,^[20] founding the 'Austrian Meteorological Society' in\n1865.^[18] The majority of his published works were related to\nmeteorology.^[18]\n\nMendel also experimented with hawkweed (Hieracium)^[53] and honeybees. He\npublished a report on his work with hawkweed,^[54] a group of plants of great\ninterest to scientists at the time because of their diversity. However, the\nresults of Mendel's inheritance study in hawkweeds was unlike his results for\npeas; the first generation was very variable and many of their offspring were\nidentical to the maternal parent. In his correspondence with Carl N\u00e4geli he\ndiscussed his results but was unable to explain them.^[53] It was not\nappreciated until the end of the nineteenth century that many hawkweed species\nwere apomictic, producing most of their seeds through an asexual\nprocess.^[37]^[55]\n\nNone of his results on bees survived, except for a passing mention in the\nreports of Moravian Apiculture Society.^[56] All that is known definitely is\nthat he used Cyprian and Carniolan bees,^[57] which were particularly\naggressive to the annoyance of other monks and visitors of the monastery such\nthat he was asked to get rid of them.^[58] Mendel, on the other hand, was fond\nof his bees, and referred to them as \"my dearest little animals\".^[59]\n\nHe also described novel plant species, and these are denoted with the\nbotanical author abbreviation \"Mendel\".^[60]\n\n## Mendelian paradox\n\nIn 1936, Ronald Fisher, a prominent statistician and population geneticist,\nreconstructed Mendel's experiments, analyzed results from the F2 (second\nfilial) generation and found the ratio of dominant to recessive phenotypes\n(e.g. yellow versus green peas; round versus wrinkled peas) to be implausibly\nand consistently too close to the expected ratio of 3 to 1.^[61]^[62]^[63]\nFisher asserted that \"the data of most, if not all, of the experiments have\nbeen falsified so as to agree closely with Mendel's expectations\".^[61]\nMendel's alleged observations, according to Fisher, were \"abominable\",\n\"shocking\",^[64] and \"cooked\".^[65]\n\nOther scholars agree with Fisher that Mendel's various observations come\nuncomfortably close to Mendel's expectations. A. W. F. Edwards,^[66] for\ninstance, remarks: \"One can applaud the lucky gambler; but when he is lucky\nagain tomorrow, and the next day, and the following day, one is entitled to\nbecome a little suspicious\". Three other lines of evidence likewise lend\nsupport to the assertion that Mendel's results are indeed too good to be\ntrue.^[67]\n\nFisher's analysis gave rise to the Mendelian paradox: Mendel's reported data\nare, statistically speaking, too good to be true, yet \"everything we know\nabout Mendel suggests that he was unlikely to engage in either deliberate\nfraud or in unconscious adjustment of his observations\".^[67] A number of\nwriters have attempted to resolve this paradox.\n\nOne attempted explanation invokes confirmation bias.^[68] Fisher accused\nMendel's experiments as \"biased strongly in the direction of agreement with\nexpectation [...] to give the theory the benefit of doubt\".^[61] In a 2004\narticle, J.W. Porteous concluded that Mendel's observations were indeed\nimplausible.^[69] An explanation for Mendel's results based on tetrad pollen\nhas been proposed, but reproduction of the experiments showed no evidence that\nthe tetrad-pollen model explains any of the bias.^[70]\n\nAnother attempt^[67] to resolve the Mendelian paradox notes that a conflict\nmay sometimes arise between the moral imperative of a bias-free recounting of\none's factual observations and the even more important imperative of advancing\nscientific knowledge. Mendel might have felt compelled \"to simplify his data\nin order to meet real, or feared, editorial objections\".^[66] Such an action\ncould be justified on moral grounds (and hence provide a resolution to the\nMendelian paradox), since the alternative\u2014refusing to comply\u2014might have\nretarded the growth of scientific knowledge. Similarly, like so many other\nobscure innovators of science,^[36] Mendel, a little known innovator of\nworking-class background, had to \"break through the cognitive paradigms and\nsocial prejudices\" of his audience.^[66] If such a breakthrough \"could be best\nachieved by deliberately omitting some observations from his report and\nadjusting others to make them more palatable to his audience, such actions\ncould be justified on moral grounds\".^[67]\n\nDaniel L. Hartl and Daniel J. Fairbanks reject outright Fisher's statistical\nargument, suggesting that Fisher incorrectly interpreted Mendel's experiments.\nThey find it likely that Mendel scored more than 10 progeny, and that the\nresults matched the expectation.
