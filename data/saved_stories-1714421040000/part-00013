Pen plotter\nenthusiasts can look forward to a new generation of art machines in Spring\n2024. Please see our home page for details.\n\n# AxiDraw V3\n\nHigh Performance Personal Writing and Drawing Machine\n\nNot currently available.\n\nRead about the Bantam Tools NextDrawTM, coming Spring 2024.\n\nThe Original AxiDraw V3\n\nThe AxiDraw V3 is a simple, modern, precise, and versatile pen plotter,\ncapable of writing or drawing on almost any flat surface. It can write with\nyour favorite fountain pens, permanent markers, and other writing implements\nto handle an endless variety of applications. Its unique design features a\nwriting head that extends beyond the machine, making it possible to draw on\nobjects bigger than the machine itself.\n\nAxiDraw is the real deal: Designed, manufactured, and supported in USA, and\nbacked by exclusive software for realistic handwriting and automation. We're\nnow shipping 3rd-generation AxiDraw V3 machines, redesigned with new custom-\nmade aluminum extrusions and precision machined components for improved\nprecision and robustness.\n\nApplications: AxiDraw is an extremely versatile machine, designed to serve a\nwide variety of everyday and specialized drawing and writing needs. You can\nuse it for almost any task that might normally be carried out with a handheld\npen.\n\nIt allows you to use your computer to produce writing that appears to be\nhandmade, complete with the unmistakable appearance of using a real pen (as\nopposed to an inkjet or laser printer) to address an envelope or sign one's\nname. And it does so with precision approaching that of a skilled artist, and\n\u2014 just as importantly \u2014 using an arm that never gets tired.\n\n  * Perfect for handwriting-like results\n\n  * Formal invitations\n\n  * Party invitation with fine-point markers\n\n  * Personalize and sign certificates\n\nAxiDraw is used by a genuinely diverse range of people, including (to name a\nfew):\n\n  * Digital artists, using AxiDraw to plot their artwork\n  * Celebrities, politicians, and elected officials, using AxiDraw as a signature machine\n  * University officials and other educators, to sign diplomas and certificates\n  * Educators, introducing students to digital design and fabrication\n  * Real estate and insurance agents, who would very much like you to open their \"handwritten\" envelopes\n  * Online retailers, including a personalized thank you note with your order\n  * Hotels that would like to leave a personalized welcome note for guests\n  * Makerspaces and hackerspaces, providing a versatile low-cost fabrication tool\n  * Tinkerers, extending AxiDraw beyond writing implements (etching tools, lasers, LEDs for light painting, vacuum pick-up tools, etc.)\n  * Pen and ink manufacturers, using AxiDraw to test their pens and inks\n  * Smartphone and tablet hardware makers, using a stylus to test their hardware\n  * Mobile device software authors, using a stylus to test their software\n  * People without use of their hands, who would like to send \"handwritten\" letters\n  * Woodworkers, laying out joinery markings directly onto wood\n  * Research scientists, as a low-cost XY motion platform\n  * Galleries, for numbering of limited-edition artwork\n  * Calligraphers, who could use a little wrist relief for certain types of busywork\n\nHandling pens and paper:\n\n  * Printable area: US Letter + A4\n\n  * Pen holder: Vertical configuration\n\n  * Pen holder: 45-degree configuration\n\n  * Pick the right angle for each writing implement\n\nThe XY travel (printable area) of the AxiDraw is just over US letter (8 1/2 \u00d7\n11\") and A4 (297 \u00d7 210 mm) paper sizes. It can work with any paper up to and\nincluding that size, including envelopes and note cards. The AxiDraw comes\nwith a mounting easel (board with clips) that can be used for holding paper,\ncards, and envelopes of various sizes.\n\nHowever, its unique design features a drawing head that extends beyond the\nbody of the machine, making it possible to also draw on flat objects bigger\nthan the machine itself. For example, you can set it right on top of a box to\nwrite an address or add decorations. You can even set it on top of a poster\nboard, chalkboard, or whiteboard to draw graphics in place.\n\nThe pen holder fits a wide variety of pens, including Sharpie fine and ultra-\nfine point markers, most rollerball and fountain pens, small-bodied whiteboard\nmarkers, and so forth. It can even hold a fountain pen at a proper angle of\n45\u00b0 to the paper. You can also use implements that aren't pens, such as\npencils, chalk, charcoal, brushes, and many others. However, you'll get the\nbest results with instruments such as fountain pens and rollerball pens, which\ndo not require the user to apply pressure.\n\nGetting Started\n\nThe AxiDraw comes fully assembled, tested, and ready to use, right out of the\nbox. A universal-input plug-in power supply is included with the AxiDraw, as\nis a USB cable, and an optional paper-holding easel. Assuming that you've\ninstalled the software first, you can be up and plotting within minutes of\nopening the box. Our comprehensive PDF user guide walks you through every step\nof the process.\n\nTo operate AxiDraw, you will need a reasonably modern computer with an\navailable USB port (Mac, Windows or Linux), plus internet access to download\nnecessary software. Pens and paper are not included. (You can use your own!\nAxiDraw does not require proprietary pens or paper.)\n\nAxiDraw is normally controlled through a set of extensions to Inkscape, the\nexcellent, popular and free vector graphics program. Basic operation is much\nlike that of a printer driver: you import or make a drawing in Inkscape, and\nuse the extensions to plot your text or artwork. It's all handled through a\nstraightforward graphical user interface, and works cleanly on Mac, Windows\nand Linux. Additional software interfaces available to AxiDraw owners include\nAxiDraw Merge, for auto-populating documents with data sourced from a CSV\nspreadsheet file.\n\nMore about AxiDraw\n\nAxiDraw V3 is the third-generation version of the AxiDraw, redesigned from the\nground up for high performance. It features smooth rolling wheels on custom\naluminum extrusions, specially designed for high stiffness and light weight.\nIts sturdy, rigid construction gives it finer quality output and in most\napplications allows it to operate with significantly higher precision and\nspeed than competing and previous generation machines.\n\nAxiDraw is a project by Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories, working in\ncollaboration with Lindsay Wilson of IJ Instruments Ltd.\n\nAxiDraw machines are designed and manufactured by Evil Mad Scientist in\nSunnyvale, California, with both domestic and imported components. The major\nstructural components, including our aluminum extrusions, are all made in USA.\n\nAxiDraw comes with lifetime technical support.
