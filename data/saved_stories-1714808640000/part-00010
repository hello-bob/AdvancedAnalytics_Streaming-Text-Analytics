A few months ago we set out to build\nan app to help you build better habits. Secretly, however, we wanted to see if\nwe could transform the most un-fun kind of app (self-improvement) into\nsomething deeper and more meaningful. Cut to a few months later, our little\napp (Not Boring) Habits is on stage accepting the Apple Design Award for\nDelight & Fun.\n\nHow\u2019d we do it? Rather than hide the screws, I\u2019d like to pull our app apart\nand show you how the pieces come together.\n\nLet me strip off the sugarcoating and share a little secret about habit\ntracker apps: they\u2019re little more than a glorified checkbox. The interaction\nis simple: every day you open the app and hit the checkbox to record a\ncompleted habit.\n\nWhile every other habit tracker app makes this basic checking action a common\ntap or swipe, we knew from experience just how important this moment was.\n\nRewards are important when building or breaking a habit. They help to train\nour minds to do something we don\u2019t want to do by giving us something we enjoy,\neven if small. And the best rewards are often not the grandest but the most\nsymbolic. You\u2019ve probably experienced this yourself if you\u2019ve written out a\ntodo list and then felt the immense satisfaction of crossing a particularly\nstubborn item off the list. The grand swiping gesture, the zipping sound, and\nthe sensation of dragging the pencil against the notepad. It\u2019s a sensorial\nexperience that punctuates the weight of the moment. And for many, it\u2019s reward\nenough to keep going.\n\nIn trying to get a particularly tricky habit to stick, I tried dozens of apps\nand nothing worked for me. Recording an action felt like yet another chore.\nNone could approach the most basic satisfaction of simply crossing out an item\non a list.\n\nCould you design a simple action that felt as satisfying and infuse it with as\nmuch symbolism? Were we about to redesign the checkbox?\n\nI think you know where this is headed.\n\n## Challenge: Make the world\u2019s most satisfying checkbox\n\n## Designing for Feel\n\nFeel is not something we talk much about as digital product designers. It\u2019s\ndifficult to quantify in metrics or even describe in words, so it tends to\nfall to the bottom of a priority list. But we know it\u2019s important. As legend\ngoes, what sold internal teams at Apple on the bold choice of building a phone\naround a touchscreen interface was the simple act of scrolling a list with\nmomentum & rubberbanding. Feel matters.\n\nMy introduction to \u201cfeel\u201d in Design came from my first job at an industrial\ndesign agency working on interfaces for consumer products like car key fobs\nand digital music players. The industrial designers talked about contours that\nfelt gratifying in the hand and actions that provided a fidget-like comfort\nsuch as flipping the lid of a Zippo lighter or the satisfying click of a pen.\n\n## What is this?\n\nAnd how do you apply it to the services and apps we design? The Browser\nCompany has written that software can optimize for emotional needs rather than\njust functional needs. Jason Yuan has promoted the idea of \u201cfidgetability\u201d\nwhere, similar to a key fob or lighter, digital actions can be designed to\nfeel satisfying. Rahul Vohra has talked about making interfaces that are first\nfun as a toy\u2014enjoyable to use without any greater aim.\n\nWhile these thoughts do a great job of framing the issue, I want to dive right\nin. Unsurprisingly, this is a solved problem in a field we Product Designers\noften ignore\u2014video games\u2014where \u201cfeel\u201d is often addressed with a little\nindustry secret called \u201cgame feel.\u201d\n\n## Game Feel\n\nIf you design digital products, you may know nothing about game feel. Don\u2019t\nfeel bad. I didn\u2019t either and neither did the dozens of smart product\ndesigners I\u2019ve asked over the last year.\n\nIn video games, the button you press to make a character jump is often a\nsimple binary input (pressed or not), and yet the output combines a very\nfinely-tuned choreography of interactions, animations, sounds, particles, and\ncamera shake to create a rich composition of sensations. The same jump button\ncan feel like a dainty hop or a powerful leap. \u201cGame feel\u201d (a.k.a. \u201cjuice\u201d) is\nthe \u201caesthetic sensation of control\u201d (Steve Swink, Game Feel) you have when\nplaying a game.\n\nThe difference comes down to choice\u2014which is to say, Design (with a capital\n\u201cD\u201d). Game feel is what makes some games feel gratifying to play (a character\ngliding down a sand dune) and others feel frustrating (sticky jumping,\nsliding). These decisions become a signature part of a game\u2019s aesthetic feel\nand gameplay.\n\nThese moments of feel aren\u2019t reserved for big moments. In fact, they\u2019re most\nimportant for routine actions you perform over and over again.\n\nFrom Steve Swink\u2019s Game Feel: The Secret Ingredient:\n\n> After all, what do you spend most of your time doing while playing Mario 64?\n>\n> \u2022 Every 20+ hours: completing the game, defeating Bowser, getting all 120\n> stars \u2022 Every hour or two: completing a \u2018boss\u2019 battle \u2022 Every half an hour:\n> getting access to a new area or painting \u2022 Every 5 minutes or so: completing\n> an objective, getting a star \u2022 Moment to Moment: steering around, running,\n> jumping, performing acrobatic maneuvers\n>\n> Breaking the game down by \u201cgranules\u201d this way, it seems that Mario 64 is a\n> game about feel. The thing you spend most of your time doing is moving Mario\n> around, interacting through the controller at a tactile, kinesthetic level.\n> It\u2019s the fundamental activity of Super Mario 64 and it feels great. It has\n> its quirks and input ambiguities, but this sensation is the foundation the\n> rest of the game sits on.\n\nIn Product Design, we sprinkle a touch of \u201cdelight\u201d on key moments\u2014colorful\nillustrations in our onboarding, confetti for major milestone reached. In\nreality, it\u2019s the mundane, everyday interactions that need our attention most.\n\nLike, say, a checkbox.\n\n# Applying Game Feel to Product Design\n\n## The checkbox\n\nThe basic checkbox serves its purpose dutifully. In truth, it was never\ndesigned to be the hero.\n\nNow, is its time to shine.\n\n## Interaction\n\nA common checkbox requires just a simple tap or click. We could\u2019ve used a\nsimple tap, but it was too easy. To avoid accidental presses and to make the\nmoment more deliberate and meaningful, we went with a long press. The\nchallenge with a long press is always discoverability\u2014How does one know\nthey\u2019re supposed to hold? The answer is to provide instant feedback with an\nanimation that builds anticipation.\n\nAnother choice we make to improve discoverability and simplify the action is\nto make the entire screen the button. You don\u2019t have to hit the visible\nbutton. You can tap and hold anywhere on the screen. This improves\ndiscoverability and corrects for errors since there\u2019s no other action to take\non this screen.\n\n## 3D Model\n\nFor the visuals, we model the checkbox in 3D\u2014we extrude a checkmark inside a\ngiant sphere. However, if you look at a 3D extrusion straight on, it still\nlooks 2D. So we rotate the checkmark to a slight angle to reveal more of its\ndimensional form. We invert the normals on the containing sphere to only\nrender the back face to effectively see into it so that we can see the\ncheckmark inside.\n\n## Animations\n\nAnimations help us communicate the interaction states and their relationship\nto one another. We can connect them together into something more coherent.\n\n### In / Out Animation\n\nWe need a way to show and hide our checkbox. Fading in and out doesn\u2019t feel\nquite right for 3D, so we go with a simple rotate & scale animation to bring\nthe objects into the scene when we need them and hide them when we don\u2019t. We\nmake this a general animation that we use throughout the app to bring in the\ndifferent level scenes as well.\n\n### Build Animation\n\nWhen you hold on the checkbox we need a way to both immediately communicate\nthe tap and yet guide you to keep holding. This is our build animation and it\nuses a combination of 2D and 3D animations.\n\nThe 2D portion is a particle simulation that \u201cfeeds\u201d the growing sphere made\nwith Lottie. It\u2019s inspired by the charging animation common in games before\nyour character delivers a big blow. Every action needs a windup. A big\naction\u2014in order to feel big\u2014needs a big wind up.\n\nThe 3D portion is a simple solid sphere filling the empty sphere of the\ncheckbox to suggest where this gesture leads. A critical detail, if you\nrelease the hold early, the animation plays in reverse to reset.\n\n### Burst Animation\n\nThis is the big moment\u2014it has to feel gratifying. We again combine 2D and 3D\nelements. The sphere and checkmark pop in and a massive starburst fills the\nscreen like an enemy hit in Hollow Knight. Another small detail you probably\ndon\u2019t notice is that the starburst rays colors match the selected skin in the\napp. If you name your layer colors, you can re-colorize them dynamically at\nruntime to fit your needs.\n\nFor more on the specifics of game animations, I recommend picking up the book\nGame Anim by Jonathan Cooper.\n\n## Sound\n\nSound can communicate the quality of an action just as powerfully as any\nvisuals. Many pass over it because they don\u2019t know how to do it right (a topic\nfor another article). The (Not Boring) soundscape was designed by the talented\nThomas Williams and combines both synthetic and real sounds.\n\nFor the main check action, we created a unique sound that swells slowly and\nthen releases in a satisfying \u201cka-thunk!\u201d Try it with sound off vs on and it\u2019s\nnight and day different.\n\n## Haptics\n\nThe most overlooked sensation in product design may be haptics\u2014the physical\nvibrations you feel. While sounds are easily thwarted by the mute switch,\nhaptics can play in any environment. It\u2019s like sound for touch. And just like\nsound, haptics can be designed.\n\nHaptics are similar to sound in that they offer two dimensions of\ncontrol\u2014frequency and amplitude. The iOS SDK provides a few basic haptic\npatterns that you can pull off the shelf and for simple clicks and detents.\nBut for a unique experience like our checkbox, you want to do something\ncustom.\n\nFor that, we use a helpful little tool called Lofelt. You can import a sound\nfile and it\u2019ll generate a custom haptic pattern to match it. With a little\ncleanup and an AHAP file for Xcode, we were ready to go.\n\n## All together now\n\nAll of these attributes didn\u2019t come together at once. We finished each in\nsteps\u2014each adding a new dimension to the feel. In sum, they work together to\ntransform the basic into something epic. That old checkbox now feels pretty\nlifeless.\n\n## Crank it Up\n\nIn Design, we often strive for minimalism\u2014using as little as needed to get a\njob done or a message across. A key tactic in that aim is to avoid redundancy.\nIf you\u2019re setting type, you strive to use only one variable to define your\nhierarchy\u2014type size, weight, color or font\u2014but you\u2019d never change them all at\nonce. It\u2019d look garish and unnecessary, right?\n\nBut adding game feel requires just the opposite. Our digital products are\ntrapped behind a hard pane of glass. We use the term \u201ctouch\u201d, but we never\nreally touch them. To truly Feel a digital experience and have an app reach\nthrough that glass, requires the Designer to employ many redundant techniques.\nVideo games figured this out decades ago. What the screen takes away, you have\nto add back in: animation, sound, and haptics.\n\nAnd if this sounds like overkill, let me assure you that we barely scratched\nthe surface. The techniques we used here to create the most satisfying\ncheckbox (animation, sound, haptics) only covers some of the very basic\ntactics of game feel. There are dozens more techniques that games utilize to\nbring small actions like this to life that we didn\u2019t employ\u2014screen shake,\nrecoil, particles, freeze frames, and many many more. There are a handful of\nexcellent videos you can watch that go into more detail. Steal the best ideas\nand take it further.\n\n## Design is so Rich\n\nIf we can add Feel to the humble checkbox, imagine what it could do for apps\nthat aid in personal connections or creativity. Many of us make the mistake in\nthinking of the apps we design as public spaces\u2014drawing inspiration from the\nrationality of airport signage or the deference of an art gallery. We\ncompletely forget that these experiences are also incredibly personal. And\nwhile a clean, white gallery space may be beautiful in its minimalism, it\u2019s\nnot the comforting place most would want to live.\n\nDesign can be reductive and rational. But it can also add richness to our\nlives.\n\nMaximize that.\n\nAnd use every tool you can get your hands on.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n#### Video games are taking over the world and it's time for Design to take\nthem seriously.
