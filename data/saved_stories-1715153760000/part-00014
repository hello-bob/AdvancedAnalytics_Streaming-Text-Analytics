Although the implementation\ndetails are crucial to solve the task at hand, we may abstract from these\nparticularities to find the common practices that are generically applicable.\n\nDesign patterns are a collection of reusable and tested solutions to recurring\nproblems in engineering. They make our software more modular, maintainable,\nand extensible. Moreover, these patterns provide a common language for\ndevelopers, making them an excellent tool for effective communication when\nproblem-solving in teams.\n\n## Design patterns in Rust\n\nRust is not object-oriented, and the combination of all its characteristics,\nsuch as functional elements, a strong type system, and the borrow checker,\nmakes it unique. Because of this, Rust design patterns vary with respect to\nother traditional object-oriented programming languages. That\u2019s why we decided\nto write this book. We hope you enjoy reading it! The book is divided in three\nmain chapters:\n\n  * Idioms: guidelines to follow when coding. They are the social norms of the community. You should break them only if you have a good reason for it.\n  * Design patterns: methods to solve common problems when coding.\n  * Anti-patterns: methods to solve common problems when coding. However, while design patterns give us benefits, anti-patterns create more problems.\n\nLast change: 2024-04-23, commit: 3719748\n\n", "frontpage": true}
