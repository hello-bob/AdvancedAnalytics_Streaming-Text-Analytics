Griffith of Wake Forest University, was published on February 7, 2024, in\nthe journal Education Economics.\n\nIt aimed to understand the relationship between the grades instructors give\nand the future employment prospects of those instructors.\n\n## How the Study Was Done\n\nThe study analyzed data from a large public university in California between\n2005 and 2020.\n\nIt measured 10,405 lecturer-years, representing a diverse group of instructors\nin terms of gender, race, and ethnicity (a \u201clecturer-year\u201d stands for one\nlecturer\u2019s employment data for a single academic year).\n\nThe instructors held different types of contracts, including 3-year contracts\n(40.2%), 1-year contracts (37.4%), and no contract (22.4%).\n\nThe average instructor taught approximately two classes per semester.\n\nThe researchers examined how grading practices impacted work assignments,\ncontract fulfillment, and the likelihood of teaching the same courses again.\n\nThey controlled for factors such as department, course characteristics, and\ninstructor demographics to isolate the effect of grading on employment\noutcomes.\n\n## What the Study Found\n\nThe study found that non-tenured instructors who gave higher grades were more\nlikely to receive more work hours, have their contracts fully met, and be\nassigned to teach the same courses again.\n\n## So what do YOU want to know?\n\nThese effects were particularly pronounced for instructors with less job\nsecurity, such as those on 1-year contracts or without any contract.\n\nSpecifically, a one-point increase in the average grade given by an instructor\nwas associated with a 1.72% increase in the likelihood of receiving a larger\nteaching load in the following academic year.\n\nInstructors who awarded higher grades were also 4.2% more likely to have their\ncontract entitlements met, meaning they were more likely to receive the full\namount of work they were promised in their contracts.\n\n## Gender and minority disparities\n\nThe study also found gender and racial differences in work hours, even with\nunion contracts in place. Female and underrepresented minority instructors\nreceived significantly lower teaching loads compared to their male and white\ncounterparts, despite controlling for factors like department and course\ncharacteristics.\n\nSpecifically, the researchers discovered that female instructors received, on\naverage, a teaching load that was 0.95% lower than their male counterparts.\nSimilarly, URM instructors had a teaching load that was 1.40% lower than non-\nURM instructors.\n\nThese disparities persisted even in the presence of union contracts designed\nto ensure fair and equitable treatment of all instructors. The findings\nsuggest that there may be underlying biases or systemic issues contributing to\nthe unequal distribution of work among non-tenured faculty based on gender and\nrace.\n\n## Why This Study Matters\n\nThese findings suggest that non-tenured instructors may feel pressure to give\nhigher grades to maintain or improve their job security.\n\nThis could have serious implications for student learning and contribute to\ngrade inflation. If instructors are incentivized to give higher grades\nregardless of student performance, it may lead to a misalignment between\ngrades and actual learning outcomes.\n\nThe study highlights the need for better ways to evaluate teaching\neffectiveness that don\u2019t solely rely on student grades.\n\nInstitutions should consider more comprehensive measures of teaching quality,\nsuch as peer evaluations, student feedback on learning outcomes, and\nprofessional development activities.\n\nWhile previous studies have examined the prevalence of non-tenured positions\nand disparities in pay and benefits, this study provides novel insights into\nhow grading practices can directly impact job security for these instructors.\n\n## Looking Forward\n\n\u201cOur results provide evidence,\u201d the authors write, \u201cthat lecturers that award\nhigher average grades receive larger teaching loads, are more likely to have\ntheir entitled workload met, and are more likely to be re-assigned the same\ncourse in a future term.\u201d\n\n## Study Details\n\n  * Title: \u201cMore A\u2019s and I get to stay?
