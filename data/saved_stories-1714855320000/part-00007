Don Lyman\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 10:13 am\n\nSad to read that botany and natural history are on the decline at major\nuniversities. I\u2019m an adjunct biology instructor at a liberal arts college, and\na freelance science writer. For the past five and a half years I wrote a\nmonthly column on nature and wildlife for The Boston Globe. My column focused\nmainly on the natural history of plant and animal species in the greater\nBoston area, and included stories about natural history related research and\nconservation projects by scientists such as Richard Primack from Boston\nUniversity, Bryan Windmiller from Zoo New England, and Wayne Petersen from\nMass Audubon. Sadly, my column was cut a few months ago. I guess writing isn\u2019t\nalways a safe refuge for biologists who want to write about natural history.\n\nReply\n\n### Republish\n\n  * Explore\n  * Read\n  * Look\n\n  * Menu\n  * About\n\nThe Latest\n\nOpinion: The Divide Over Youth Transgender Care\n\nIndigenous Forest Gardens Help Bolster Land Rights\n\nManaging Predators From the Sky\n\nPulling Watts from Ocean Water\n\nBook Review: The Enduring Allure of Alien Worlds\n\nOpinion: Russia\u2019s Theft of Ukrainian Fossils\n\nThe Lasting Impact of Exposure to Gun Violence\n\nMexico City\u2019s Metro System Is Sinking Fast\n\n0%\n\n25%\n\n50%\n\n75%\n\n100%\n\nShare\n\nComment\n\nBooks\n\nRepublish Print\n\n# Book Review: The Hidden Extinction Crisis of Natural Historians\n\nRepublish\n\n#### In \u201cUnrooted,\u201d Erin Zimmerman connects the loss of species to the loss of\nthe women who study them.\n\nTop: A rare 18th century book containing nature prints is displayed at the\nHerbaruim library at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in London.

He was chronically ill and created his transformative works of\nscience from the comfort of his home and gardens, with his children drawing in\nhis notes and helping with experiments. \u201cThe way he worked looked nothing like\nthe professional men of science of that time. Yet he met with incredible\nsuccess,\u201d Erin Zimmerman notes in her recent memoir, \u201cUnrooted: Botany,\nMotherhood and the Fight to Save an Old Science.\u201d\n\nBOOK REVIEW \u2014 \u201cUnrooted: Botany, Motherhood, and the Fight to Save an Old\nScience,\u201d by Erin Zimmerman (Melville House, 272 pages).\n\nDarwin may seem an odd focus for a book about the experiences of modern women\nwho work in natural history, but he existed at an important turning point.\nBotanist and suffragist Lydia Becker, who began corresponding with Darwin in\nthe 1860s, saw the potential for him to be an inspiration. After Becker had\nbeen rejected from Manchester\u2019s scientific societies because of her evidence-\nbased arguments that women were not intellectually inferior to men, she began\na local scientific society for women. She spoke to these women about what\nDarwin accomplished from home, suggesting they could do the same.\n\nWomen of means in Europe and the United States, including Becker, dominated\nbotany in its earliest history. At this inflection point in the mid-1800s, men\nattempted to professionalize and \u201cdefeminize\u201d the field, Zimmerman writes,\nmoving science from the home into the laboratory and intentionally\nmarginalizing women. The structures and expectations that came to define\nscience workplaces were created at that time. Zimmerman uses this example to\nshow how her experience as a 21st-century botanist is still influenced by\nthese structures, at the same time that natural history \u2014 the foundation of\nall biological sciences \u2014 is on the decline. For women in the field, it\u2019s a\ndouble whammy.\n\nZimmerman ultimately left botany and became a science writer, and her\nexperience is an example of a much larger phenomenon: Women leave science in\ndroves, and natural history scholars are becoming as endangered as the rare\nspecies that their work identifies and catalogs. As she puts it: \u201cThe most\nastounding thing about taxonomy as a science is the yawning gap between how\ncrucial it is to the enterprise of human knowledge and how valued it is in\npractice.\u201d\n\nAccording to \u201cUnrooted,\u201d between 1988 and 2010, more than half of the top 50\nmost-funded universities ended their botany programs. The recent announcement\nthat Duke University will close its flagship herbarium, which was met with\nintense backlash from the international research community, makes this stark\nreality especially apparent. Although the herbarium \u2014 which opened in 1921 and\nis one of the largest collections of plants, algae, and fungi in the country \u2014\nis not mentioned in Zimmerman\u2019s memoir and she doesn\u2019t have a direct\nconnection to Duke, the timing of that closure with her book\u2019s release\ncouldn\u2019t be more apt.\n\n> Zimmerman ultimately left botany and became a science writer, and her\n> experience is an example of a much larger phenomenon: Women leave science in\n> droves.\n\nThe life of a botanist hasn\u2019t always been so grim for Zimmerman. She delighted\nin her early work. In the plant anatomy lab where she first trained as an\nundergraduate, researchers \u201cspent the bulk of their day working alongside the\nstudents and technicians,\u201d she writes, and \u201ceveryone seemed happy and\nrelaxed.\u201d But it was a vestige from another time, run by two longtime tenured\nbotanists. That experience gave her \u201ca very skewed idea of what being a\nscientist in the competitive, often underfunded rush of the twenty-first\ncentury looked like,\u201d adding later, \u201dIt was a place I would always be trying\nto find again.\u201d That longing is a theme throughout the book.\n\nZimmerman describes the incredible experiences she had during her dissertation\nwork: a stint with scanning electron microscopy at the world-renowned Kew\nGardens in the United Kingdom; an adventurous plant collections trip to\nGuyana, where she scaled steep rock faces and rainforest trees for plants of\nall sorts, especially on the lookout for a group of early-diverging legumes\nthat she studied; and genetics and microscopy study at the Montreal Botanical\nGarden. During this phase, she also pondered motherhood, well aware that many\nof these research experiences were not set up for people with children.\nIndeed, 43 percent of women in science leave research or take part-time roles\nafter having their first child; just 23 percent of men do the same.\nZimmerman\u2019s longtime partner, Eric, did want children, and it\u2019s clear from the\nquestions she asked herself and her colleagues that, despite her initial\ntrepidation, she did as well.\n\nAs her Ph.D. work drew to a close, Zimmerman repeatedly heard that funding for\nboth postdocs and natural history research was scarce. \u201cI was crestfallen,\u201d\nshe writes. \u201cIt seemed like everything I loved most in science belonged to an\nearlier time.\u201d\n\n#### Support Undark Magazine\n\nUndark is a non-profit, editorially independent magazine covering the\ncomplicated and often fractious intersection of science and society.

Although\nher new boss seemed supportive, Zimmerman felt increasingly isolated from her\ncolleagues, both during pregnancy and after returning to work following her\nparental leave. She endured comments about her \u201cbrain fog\u201d and her lack of\ndedication to the field. Despite the fact that she was a new mom who was in\npain and physically exhausted, her mentor pushed her to work more. In one\nparticularly egregious moment, Zimmerman had to pump breast milk in a rarely\nused shower, where she wondered: \u201cHow had I once been worth six figures in\ndoctoral scholarship money but now wasn\u2019t worth a clean pumping space?\u201d\nOverworked and unsupported, Zimmerman left her research career. On the\ndecision to leave academia, she writes: \u201cStaring down the barrel of a decade\nof short-term contract appointments at the same time you need to be starting\nyour family would and does make even the most dedicated scientist think\ntwice.\u201d\n\nZimmerman deftly weaves the personal essays in her book into the larger\nhistory of botany. What I learned from Zimmerman is that this career shift \u2014\none that I made too, from plant biology to science writing \u2014 is a pattern that\nhas played out since botany\u2019s professionalization in the 19th century. In 1848\nwhen Becker was marginalized from the field, she published a book that brought\nher expertise to everyone, \u201cBotany for Novices.\u201d Similarly, Arabella Buckley,\nanother correspondent of Darwin, pivoted to writing children\u2019s books, such as\n\u201cThe Fairy-Land of Science.\u201d These women took advantage of a boom in\npublishing, and were among the writers who launched the age of popular\nscience.\n\n> According to \u201cUnrooted,\u201d between 1988 and 2010, more than half of the top 50\n> most-funded universities ended their botany programs.\n\nWomen scientists continue this tradition today. Zimmerman joins a cadre of\nplant biology memoirists who write vividly about their personal experiences in\n21st-century science, and how those experiences connect to social problems. In\nthe New York Times bestseller \u201cLab Girl,\u201d Hope Jahren writes about the job\nprecarity of her longtime collaborator and lab manager, Bill Hagopian. In\n\u201cBraiding Sweetgrass,\u201d Robin Wall Kimmerer calls for a reciprocal relationship\nwith nature. Lauren Oakes\u2019s \u201cIn Search of the Canary Tree\u201d highlights the need\nto incorporate social science and oral history collections into scientific\nwork about environmental loss. These works also provide a uniquely personal\nview into modern research life, rare moments of candidness and intimacy that\ngeneral audiences rarely get from scientists. Who knew that these authors were\nfollowing in Becker\u2019s and Buckley\u2019s footsteps \u2014 keeping up a long tradition\nenvisioning a more inclusive science?\n\nWriting also gave Zimmerman an outlet to share science with everyone. She\nwrites, \u201cAt a moment when I felt excluded myself, I could choose to be an\nactive part of including others.\u201d\n\nNatural history is incredibly popular \u2014 life on Earth is fascinating and fun.\nAnd yet, Zimmerman\u2019s experience shows how people can be drawn into the field\nby these interests, and then let down by the exclusionary culture. Zimmerman\nprovides a rare window into the inner life of a new mom in biology research.\nAlthough she nods to many solutions about how funding and incentives could be\nchanged, she does not explore how they might be accomplished.\n\n> Zimmerman deftly weaves the personal essays in her book into the larger\n> history of botany\n\nBearing witness to this loss is a huge and welcome feat in and of itself, and\na short book such as this one cannot be expected to thoroughly solve such\nwicked problems. But in the same way that Zimmerman reaches back in history,\nthe book would have benefited from greater depth on who is creating cultural\nchange in science today. The push by postdocs to unionize at some\ninstitutions, for example, is not mentioned at all.\n\nStories about quitting science can easily bog down in negativity. Zimmerman\navoids this pitfall beautifully, never losing sight of her enthusiasm and\ngratitude for her good experiences in science. In a scene near the end of the\nbook, Zimmerman brightly describes joining a group of mostly women\nvolunteering to help digitize plant collections. In her version, it was an\nexample of the inclusiveness of citizen science, but I couldn\u2019t help feeling a\npang of rage. Experts like Zimmerman are out there, consistently impeded from\npassing on their knowledge or contributing to their field. I can attest that\nmany of them volunteer their time to other scientists\u2019 work.\n\nAs Darwin\u2019s story shows, science has often been advanced by people working\noutside the hallowed halls of the ivory tower. Many people working to save our\ncollective knowledge of natural history before it\u2019s lost are left doing just\nthat, on their own time. Professional science was set up to exclude people;\nthe movement toward a more inclusive science can rectify historical and\ncontemporary wrongs.\n\nKatie L.
