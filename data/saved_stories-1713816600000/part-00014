At its\ncurrent pace, the NVD is analyzing about 2.9 percent of all published CVEs\nit's been sent, well behind its pace in previous years. If there were no new\nCVEs submitted today, it could take the NVD more than 91 days to empty that\nbacklog and get caught up.\n\nGiven the state of the NVD and vulnerability management, we felt it was worth\nlooking at the current state of the NVD, how we got to this point, what it\nmeans for security teams, and where we go from here.\n\n# What is the NVD?\n\nThe U.S.\u2019s National Vulnerability Database provides the most comprehensive\nlist of CVEs anywhere. This tracks security vulnerabilities in hardware and\nsoftware and distributes that list to the public for anyone to use.\n\nThis data enables organizations and large networks to automate vulnerability\nmanagement, take appropriate security steps when a new vulnerability is\ndiscovered, important references and metrics that indicate how serious a\nparticular vulnerability is.\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has managed the\nNVD since 2000, when it was started as the Internet Category of Attack\ntoolkit. It eventually morphed into the NVD, which passed the\n150,000-vulnerability mark in 2021.\n\nIn addition to simply listing the CVEs that are regularly disclosed, the NVD\nscores vulnerabilities using the CVSS system, which often differ from the\ninitial severity score that\u2019s assigned by the researcher that discovers the\nvulnerability, or the company or organization behind the affected product or\nsoftware.\n\nSince the creation of I-CAT, no other organization or private company has as\ncomprehensive of a list of vulnerabilities as the NVD, nor do they offer it\nfor free like NIST does.\n\n# Why is the backlog a problem?\n\nOn the surface, it may seem like the fact that the NVD has been slow to\nanalyze CVEs isn\u2019t all that bad, considering security issues are still being\ndisclosed and patched every day (think: Microsoft Patch Tuesday).\n\nHowever, the lack of a single source of CVEs augmented information is\ndetrimental to administrators, security researchers and users, and security\nexperts are warning that the issue needs to be addressed quickly, or an\nalternative needs to be adopted.\n\nWith the NVD being a collection of all this information, it\u2019s up to the\nindividual vendors to responsibly disclose and release vulnerabilities\ndiscovered in their products, which puts the onus on administrators to track\nthat information down. If someone who handles patch management for a network\nwas relying on the NVD for their information, that list is likely outdated at\nthis point, and instead, they need to visit each individual vendor to find out\nwhat vulnerabilities were recently disclosed in their products, and how large\nof a risk they present.\n\nOn any given network, that could be dozens to even hundreds of vendors, and\nwhile massive companies like Apple and Microsoft have easy-to-access security\nand vulnerability information, smaller open-source projects may not have the\nsame resources that administrators need.\n\nThe NVD is also the most trusted source for severity scores. Their\ncalculations are generally what most users see when they read a security\nadvisory. But without their input, it\u2019s on the researcher or vendor to assign\na score, instead. Under that system, there is no guarantee that a company may\nnot want to score their vulnerability higher so it does not seem as serious,\nwhile researchers may want to bump up the severity of the issue they find so\nthey are credited with discovering a higher-severity issue.\n\nAs Talos has discussed before, a CVSS score is not the only metric worth\nrelying on when patching, but it does play a major role in how the public\nviews vulnerabilities and whether they\u2019re likely to be exploited in the wild.\nAccording to Talos\u2019 2023 Year in Review report, eight of the 10 most-exploited\nCVEs last year received a severity score of 9.3 or higher. Any sense of\nuncertainty around CVSS scores can leave administrators scratching their heads\nand without a \u201cnorth star\u201d for patch management.\n\nThe recent xz Utility vulnerability that was luckily prevented before any\nattackers could exploit it still does not have a Common Weakness Enumeration\n(CWE) assigned to it as of April 10 because of the backlog. Had an exploit for\nthis been used, defenders would be missing crucial context and information for\ndefending against this backdoor.\n\n# How did this backlog develop?\n\nNIST has been relatively vague about why the agency has been slow to process\nnew vulnerabilities. The first sign of trouble came in February, when NIST\nreleased a statement that a \u201cgrowing backlog of vulnerabilities\u201d had developed\nbecause of \u201can increase in software and, therefore, vulnerabilities, as well\nas a change in interagency support.\u201d\n\nNIST\u2019s budget was cut by about 12 percent after the recent package of funding\nbills passed by U.S. Congress, as well.\n\nThe agency also said in February that additional NIST staff were being shifted\naround to address the backlog, and at the recent VulnCon and Annual CNA\nSummit, the NVD program director promised that NIST was developing a\nconsortium to help address the issues with the NVD.\n\nThe total number of vulnerabilities disclosed continues to increase every\nyear, driven by larger amounts of software on the market and increased\nvisibility into security concerns and research. Last year, there were 28,961\nCVEs disclosed, according to the CVE Program, an increase of 15 percent from\n2022. The last time there were fewer CVEs assigned in a year compared to the\nyear prior was in 2016.\n\n# What are some potential solutions?\n\nNIST has continued to publicly support the NVD and says it's preparing to\nrevitalize the database. But it\u2019s unclear what short- or long-term solutions\nor alternatives exist.\n\nJerry Gamblin, a principal threat detection and response engineer for Cisco\nVulnerability Management, said there has yet to be a company or organization\nwilling to take on the monstrous task of tracking and scoring *every* CVE,\nespecially for free.\n\nOther vulnerability catalogs exist like the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure\nSecurity Agency\u2019s (CISA) Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, but\nthe KEV only lists vulnerabilities that have actively been exploited in the\nwild.\n\nIn short \u2014 all the potential alternatives are imperfect.\n\n\u201cWe can get the data from anywhere, and AI data could even help, but people\njust need to decide,\u201d Gamblin said. \u201cIs there going to be just one source of\ndata? And who is the source of truth for this data? Who owns this data?\u201d\n\nA private company like MITRE could step up to create its own solution, but\nit\u2019d likely want to charge for access to that database. Any non-profit\norganization who also wants to step up would also likely need a massive influx\nof money and manpower to address the sheer volume of CVEs that come in every\nday.\n\nAnd while NIST says the consortium is in the works, there\u2019s no timetable for\nhow long it could take for that to be established, and which private companies\nwould be involved.\n\nFor now, it\u2019s best to stick to tried-and-true patching strategies that have\nworked for years. Software, like Cisco Vulnerability Management, which has not\nbeen affected by the NVD backlog, can also assist in automating the patching\nprocess and prioritizing which vulnerabilities to patch first.\n\n##### Share this post\n\n#### Related Content\n\n### The LockBit story: Why the ransomware affiliate model can turn takedowns\ninto disruptions\n\nMarch 15, 2024 10:00\n\nTalos explores the recent law enforcement takedown of LockBit, a prolific\nransomware group that claimed to resume their operations 7 days later.\n\n### How are attackers using QR codes in phishing emails and lure documents?\n\nFebruary 14, 2024 08:00\n\nQR code attacks are particularly dangerous because they move the attack vector\noff a protected computer and onto the target\u2019s personal mobile device, which\nusually has fewer security protections in place and ultimately has the\nsensitive information that attackers are after.\n\n### What is threat hunting?\n\nNovember 28, 2023 08:00\n\nMany organizations are curious about the idea of threat hunting, but what does\nthis really entail?
