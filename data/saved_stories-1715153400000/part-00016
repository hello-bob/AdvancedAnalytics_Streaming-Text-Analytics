From the hum of traffic outside your\nwindow to the next-door neighbor\u2019s blaring TV to sounds from a co-worker\u2019s\ncubicle, unwanted noise remains a resounding problem.\n\nTo cut through the din, an interdisciplinary collaboration of researchers from\nMIT and elsewhere developed a sound-suppressing silk fabric that could be used\nto create quiet spaces.\n\nThe fabric, which is barely thicker than a human hair, contains a special\nfiber that vibrates when a voltage is applied to it. The researchers leveraged\nthose vibrations to suppress sound in two different ways.\n\nIn one, the vibrating fabric generates sound waves that interfere with an\nunwanted noise to cancel it out, similar to noise-canceling headphones, which\nwork well in a small space like your ears but do not work in large enclosures\nlike rooms or planes.\n\nIn the other, more surprising technique, the fabric is held still to suppress\nvibrations that are key to the transmission of sound. This prevents noise from\nbeing transmitted through the fabric and quiets the volume beyond. This second\napproach allows for noise reduction in much larger spaces like rooms or cars.\n\nBy using common materials like silk, canvas, and muslin, the researchers\ncreated noise-suppressing fabrics which would be practical to implement in\nreal-world spaces. For instance, one could use such a fabric to make dividers\nin open workspaces or thin fabric walls that prevent sound from getting\nthrough.\n\n\u201cNoise is a lot easier to create than quiet. In fact, to keep noise out we\ndedicate a lot of space to thick walls. [First author] Grace\u2019s work provides a\nnew mechanism for creating quiet spaces with a thin sheet of fabric,\u201d says\nYoel Fink, a professor in the departments of Materials Science and Engineering\nand Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, a Research Laboratory of\nElectronics principal investigator, and senior author of a paper on the\nfabric.\n\nThe study\u2019s lead author is Grace (Noel) Yang SM \u201921, PhD \u201924. Co-authors\ninclude MIT graduate students Taigyu Joo, Hyunhee Lee, Henry Cheung, and\nYongyi Zhao; Zachary Smith, the Robert N. Noyce Career Development Professor\nof Chemical Engineering at MIT; graduate student Guanchun Rui and professor\nLei Zhu of Case Western University; graduate student Jinuan Lin and Assistant\nProfessor Chu Ma of the University of Wisconsin at Madison; and Latika\nBalachander, a graduate student at the Rhode Island School of Design. An open-\naccess paper about the research appeared recently in Advanced Materials.\n\nSilky silence\n\nThe sound-suppressing silk builds off the group\u2019s prior work to create fabric\nmicrophones.\n\nIn that research, they sewed a single strand of piezoelectric fiber into\nfabric. Piezoelectric materials produce an electrical signal when squeezed or\nbent. When a nearby noise causes the fabric to vibrate, the piezoelectric\nfiber converts those vibrations into an electrical signal, which can capture\nthe sound.\n\nIn the new work, the researchers flipped that idea to create a fabric\nloudspeaker that can be used to cancel out soundwaves.\n\n\u201cWhile we can use fabric to create sound, there is already so much noise in\nour world. We thought creating silence could be even more valuable,\u201d Yang\nsays.\n\nApplying an electrical signal to the piezoelectric fiber causes it to vibrate,\nwhich generates sound. The researchers demonstrated this by playing Bach\u2019s\n\u201cAir\u201d using a 130-micrometer sheet of silk mounted on a circular frame.\n\nTo enable direct sound suppression, the researchers use a silk fabric\nloudspeaker to emit sound waves that destructively interfere with unwanted\nsound waves. They control the vibrations of the piezoelectric fiber so that\nsound waves emitted by the fabric are opposite of unwanted sound waves that\nstrike the fabric, which can cancel out the noise.\n\nHowever, this technique is only effective over a small area. So, the\nresearchers built off this idea to develop a technique that uses fabric\nvibrations to suppress sound in much larger areas, like a bedroom.\n\nLet\u2019s say your next-door neighbors are playing foosball in the middle of the\nnight. You hear noise in your bedroom because the sound in their apartment\ncauses your shared wall to vibrate, which forms sound waves on your side.\n\nTo suppress that sound, the researchers could place the silk fabric onto your\nside of the shared wall, controlling the vibrations in the fiber to force the\nfabric to remain still. This vibration-mediated suppression prevents sound\nfrom being transmitted through the fabric.\n\n\u201cIf we can control those vibrations and stop them from happening, we can stop\nthe noise that is generated, as well,\u201d Yang says.\n\nA mirror for sound\n\nSurprisingly, the researchers found that holding the fabric still causes sound\nto be reflected by the fabric, resulting in a thin piece of silk that reflects\nsound like a mirror does with light.\n\nTheir experiments also revealed that both the mechanical properties of a\nfabric and the size of its pores affect the efficiency of sound generation.\nWhile silk and muslin have similar mechanical properties, the smaller pore\nsizes of silk make it a better fabric loudspeaker.\n\nBut the effective pore size also depends on the frequency of sound waves. If\nthe frequency is low enough, even a fabric with relatively large pores could\nfunction effectively, Yang says.\n\nWhen they tested the silk fabric in direct suppression mode, the researchers\nfound that it could significantly reduce the volume of sounds up to 65\ndecibels (about as loud as enthusiastic human conversation). In vibration-\nmediated suppression mode, the fabric could reduce sound transmission up to 75\npercent.\n\nThese results were only possible due to a robust group of collaborators, Fink\nsays. Graduate students at the Rhode Island School of Design helped the\nresearchers understand the details of constructing fabrics; scientists at the\nUniversity of Wisconsin at Madison conducted simulations; researchers at Case\nWestern Reserve University characterized materials; and chemical engineers in\nthe Smith Group at MIT used their expertise in gas membrane separation to\nmeasure airflow through the fabric.\n\nMoving forward, the researchers want to explore the use of their fabric to\nblock sound of multiple frequencies. This would likely require complex signal\nprocessing and additional electronics.\n\nIn addition, they want to further study the architecture of the fabric to see\nhow changing things like the number of piezoelectric fibers, the direction in\nwhich they are sewn, or the applied voltages could improve performance.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of knobs we can turn to make this sound-suppressing fabric\nreally effective. We want to get people thinking about controlling structural\nvibrations to suppress sound. This is just the beginning,\u201d says Yang.\n\nThis work is funded, in part, by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the\nArmy Research Office (ARO), the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), and\nthe Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.\n\n### Share this news article on:\n\n  * X\n  * Facebook\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Reddit\n  * Print\n\n## Paper\n\nPaper: \u201cSingle Layer Silk and Cotton Woven Fabrics for Acoustic Emission and\nActive Sound Suppression\u201d\n\n## Related Links\n\n  * Yoel Fink\n  * Zachary Smith\n  * Research Laboratory of Electronics\n  * Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science\n  * Department of Materials Science and Engineering\n  * Department of Chemical Engineering\n  * School of Engineering\n  * MIT Schwarzman College of Computing\n\n## Related Topics\n\n  * Research\n  * Electronics\n  * Sensors\n  * Design\n  * Materials science and engineering\n  * Chemical engineering\n  * Research Laboratory of Electronics\n  * Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (eecs)\n  * School of Engineering\n  * School of Science\n  * MIT Schwarzman College of Computing\n  * National Science Foundation (NSF)\n\n## Related Articles\n\n### Fiber \u201cbarcodes\u201d can make clothing labels that last\n\n### A fabric that \u201chears\u201d your heart's sounds\n\n### Engineers create a programmable fiber\n\n## More MIT News\n\n### How AI might shape LGBTQIA+ advocacy\n\nNew \u201cAI Comes Out of the Closet\u201d system seeks to merge artificial intelligence\nand LGBTQIA+ support.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### Two MIT PhD students awarded J-WAFS fellowships for their research on\nwater\n\nJonathan Bessette and Akash Ball have been named 2024-25 J-WAFS Fellows for\nwater treatment technologies.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### Exploring the mysterious alphabet of sperm whales\n\nMIT CSAIL and Project CETI researchers reveal complex communication patterns\nin sperm whales, deepening our understanding of animal language systems.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### \u201cPathways to Invention\u201d documentary debuts on PBS, streaming\n\nAn award-winning documentary co-produced by the Lemelson-MIT Program\ncelebrates invention, innovation, and curiosity.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### William Green named director of MIT Energy Initiative\n\nIn his new role, the professor of chemical engineering plans to speed up the\nconsensus process among academics, business leaders, and policymakers for a\nsuccessful energy transition.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### Seizing solar\u2019s bright future\n\nWith laser-based precision tools for measuring and tuning materials, MIT\nspinout Optigon aims to rev up the energy transition.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n  * More news on MIT News homepage \u2192\n\n## More about MIT News at Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nThis website is managed by the MIT News Office, part of the Institute Office\nof Communications.\n\n### News by Schools/College:\n\n  * School of Architecture and Planning\n  * School of Engineering\n  * School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences\n  * MIT Sloan School of Management\n  * School of Science\n  * MIT Schwarzman College of Computing\n\n### Resources:\n\n  * About the MIT News Office\n  * MIT News Press Center\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Press Inquiries\n  * Filming Guidelines\n  * RSS Feeds\n\n### Tools:\n\n  * Subscribe to MIT Daily/Weekly\n  * Subscribe to press releases\n  * Submit campus news\n  * Guidelines for campus news contributors\n  * Guidelines on generative AI\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA,\nUSA\n\nRecommended Links:\n\n  * Visit\n  * Map (opens in new window)\n  * Events (opens in new window)\n  * People (opens in new window)\n  * Careers (opens in new window)\n  * Contact\n  * Privacy\n  * Accessibility\n  *     * Social Media Hub\n    * MIT on X\n    * MIT on Facebook\n    * MIT on YouTube\n    * MIT on Instagram\n\n", "frontpage": true}
