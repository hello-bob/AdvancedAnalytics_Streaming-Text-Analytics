They don\u2019t want\nimmigrants. Immigrants are what makes us strong,\" Biden was quoted as saying\nby Indian Express.\n\nHe emphasised the importance of immigrants to the country's economic growth,\ncontrasting his stance with that of his Republican rival, former president\nDonald Trump, whom he has criticised for his anti-immigrant rhetoric.\n\nSince taking office, Biden has implemented more lenient immigration policies\ncompared to the Trump administration. He has eased restrictions on migrants\nand introduced new \"parole\" policies to allow certain migrants to enter the\ncountry legally for humanitarian reasons.\n\nHowever, Biden's approach to immigration has faced criticism, particularly\nregarding unemployment and immigration issues.\n\nA poll conducted by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that\nover half of US adults believe that Biden's presidency has negatively impacted\nthe country in terms of the cost of living and immigration.\n\nSave & read from anywhere!\n\nBookmark stories for easy access on any device or the Swarajya app.\n\nSign In\n\nBhuvan Krishna is Staff Writer at Swarajya.\n\nTags\n\n* India\n* xenophobia\n* US President Biden\n\nJoin our WhatsApp channel - no spam, only sharp analysis\n\nIntroducing ElectionsHQ + 50 Ground Reports Project\n\nThe 2024 elections might seem easy to guess, but there are some important\nquestions that shouldn't be missed.\n\nDo freebies still sway voters?
