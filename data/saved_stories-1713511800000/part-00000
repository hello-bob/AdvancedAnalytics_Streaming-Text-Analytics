Edgar is now Picco. We\u2019re seeking business and technical talent to\ntransform the raw potential of an AI-first software architecture into\nsolutions for 100x more business use-cases. See the links at the end to apply\nfor a position.\n\nIn the context of business software, we define AGI as the dynamic assembly of\ncode, or \u2018skills,\u2019 to handle customer requests, or \u2018tasks.\u2019 A skill can range\nfrom a simple five-line API call to a complex assembly of prompt chains and\nother skills. We are currently \u2018coaching\u2019 the Picco system to create skills\nthat accelerate the sales processes of PSL portfolio companies.\n\nWhat is an AI-first software architecture?\n\nIn the past we had design patterns like \u201cModel View Controller\u201d web sites, or\n\u201cmobile-first\u201d apps. The power of LLMs is so great, we should re-organize our\ncode to maximize how we use them.\n\n1/ Functional Programming model: Everything\u2019s a skill. I used to be an Object-\nOriented programmer, drawn to how relatable objects are and how the code\nresembles English. But a graph of individual functions is much easier for an\nLLM to reason about.\n\nIn Functional Programming, each function is self-descriptive, with clear\ninputs and side effects. We use clean, well-documented skill templates. We\nchose TypeScript for its concise syntax and well-understood asynchronous\nsemantics. The call graph (an example is below) becomes the agent\u2019s skill\ntree.\n\n2/ Skill Library: Similar to software modules, our Skills Library contains\ntrees of skills (functions) in various areas of expertise. These serve as\nexamples for generating more code and as building blocks to build upon.\nSelecting the right skill is a critical piece of the AGI puzzle (see\nIncremental AGI). Currently, Picco uses a simple in-memory vector store and,\ndepending on the context, invokes an LLM to select the skill to invoke, or as\nan example for another generation, or to build upon.\n\n3/ Extensive Prompt-chain Skills: Certain types of programmatic reasoning,\npreviously unachievable, can now be accomplished using an LLM (summarizing\ntext, writing, answering questions, subjective scoring, filling the blanks).\nAlthough there\u2019s nothing particularly unique to Picco about these prompt\nchains, they are revolutionizing software development everywhere. In an AI-\nfirst architecture, they are integral to the software\u2019s operation. Any robust\nprompt chain software must include tooling for switching models, maintaining\ntest cases, estimating costs, and logging prompts and completions.\n\n4/ Self-Improving: Picco\u2019s \u201cwriteSkill\u201d and \u201creviewSkill\u201d are themselves\nskills that generate new and improve existing skills. While we use a\ntraditional MVC framework for our website, adopting this model means that,\nwherever possible, everything is implemented as a skill.\n\nWhat is Picco not? Today, Picco does not do browser automation, nor is it a\nsoftware development tool. Picco engineer\u2019s use Picco\u2019s skills to make more\nskills. Picco has not yet reached the stage of being an autonomous agent, we\ndon\u2019t need to satisfy our customers. Currently, Picco lacks a conversational\ninterface for customers\u2014we are still relying on human coaches to translate\ncustomer requests into skills. The key is for Picco to deliver real value for\ncustomers, so we can achieve more agentic and AGI-like behavior over time.\n\nWhat other key elements and design patterns do you think will emerge as\napplication architectures evolve to incporate AI?\n\nExcited to define a new AI First Architecture? Apply today.\n\nCEO \u2013 Picco\n\nCTO \u2013 Picco\n\nPrincipal AI Enginner \u2013 Picco\n\nAI Integration Engineer \u2013 Picco\n\nAdam\n\n## Published\n\n## April 18, 2024\n\n### Cancel Reply\n\nIndependent Publisher empowered by WordPress\n\n", "frontpage": false}
