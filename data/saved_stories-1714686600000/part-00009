By helping robots\nrapidly and reliably learn complex skills, the new method could significantly\nimprove the practicality \u2014 and safety \u2014 of robots for a range of applications,\nincluding self-driving cars, delivery drones, household assistants and\nautomation.\n\nCalled Maximum Diffusion Reinforcement Learning (MaxDiff RL), the algorithm\u2019s\nsuccess lies in its ability to encourage robots to explore their environments\nas randomly as possible in order to gain a diverse set of experiences. This\n\u201cdesigned randomness\u201d improves the quality of data that robots collect\nregarding their own surroundings. And, by using higher-quality data, simulated\nrobots demonstrated faster and more efficient learning, improving their\noverall reliability and performance.\n\nWhen tested against other AI platforms, simulated robots using Northwestern\u2019s\nnew algorithm consistently outperformed state-of-the-art models. The new\nalgorithm works so well, in fact, that robots learned new tasks and then\nsuccessfully performed them within a single attempt \u2014 getting it right the\nfirst time. This starkly contrasts current AI models, which enable slower\nlearning through trial and error.\n\nThe research was published today (May 2) in the journal Nature Machine\nIntelligence.\n\n\u201cOther AI frameworks can be somewhat unreliable,\u201d said Northwestern\u2019s Thomas\nBerrueta, who led the study. \u201cSometimes they will totally nail a task, but,\nother times, they will fail completely. With our framework, as long as the\nrobot is capable of solving the task at all, every time you turn on your robot\nyou can expect it to do exactly what it\u2019s been asked to do. This makes it\neasier to interpret robot successes and failures, which is crucial in a world\nincreasingly dependent on AI.\u201d\n\nBerrueta is a Presidential Fellow at Northwestern and a Ph.D. candidate in\nmechanical engineering at the McCormick School of Engineering. Robotics expert\nTodd Murphey, a professor of mechanical engineering at McCormick and\nBerrueta\u2019s adviser, is the paper\u2019s senior author. Berrueta and Murphey co-\nauthored the paper with Allison Pinosky, also a Ph.D. candidate in Murphey\u2019s\nlab.\n\n## The disembodied disconnect\n\nTo train machine-learning algorithms, researchers and developers use large\nquantities of big data, which humans carefully filter and curate. AI learns\nfrom this training data, using trial and error until it reaches optimal\nresults. While this process works well for disembodied systems, like ChatGPT\nand Google Gemini (formerly Bard), it does not work for embodied AI systems\nlike robots. Robots, instead, collect data by themselves \u2014 without the luxury\nof human curators.\n\nAllison Pinosky and Thomas Berrueta\n\n\u201cTraditional algorithms are not compatible with robotics in two distinct\nways,\u201d Murphey said. \u201cFirst, disembodied systems can take advantage of a world\nwhere physical laws do not apply. Second, individual failures have no\nconsequences. For computer science applications, the only thing that matters\nis that it succeeds most of the time. In robotics, one failure could be\ncatastrophic.\u201d\n\nTo solve this disconnect, Berrueta, Murphey and Pinosky aimed to develop a\nnovel algorithm that ensures robots will collect high-quality data on-the-go.\nAt its core, MaxDiff RL commands robots to move more randomly in order to\ncollect thorough, diverse data about their environments. By learning through\nself-curated random experiences, robots acquire necessary skills to accomplish\nuseful tasks.\n\n## Getting it right the first time\n\nTo test the new algorithm, the researchers compared it against current, state-\nof-the-art models. Using computer simulations, the researchers asked simulated\nrobots to perform a series of standard tasks. Across the board, robots using\nMaxDiff RL learned faster than the other models. They also correctly performed\ntasks much more consistently and reliably than others.\n\nPerhaps even more impressive: Robots using the MaxDiff RL method often\nsucceeded at correctly performing a task in a single attempt. And that\u2019s even\nwhen they started with no knowledge.\n\n\u201cOur robots were faster and more agile \u2014 capable of effectively generalizing\nwhat they learned and applying it to new situations,\u201d Berrueta said. \u201cFor\nreal-world applications where robots can\u2019t afford endless time for trial and\nerror, this is a huge benefit.\u201d\n\nBecause MaxDiff RL is a general algorithm, it can be used for a variety of\napplications. The researchers hope it addresses foundational issues holding\nback the field, ultimately paving the way for reliable decision-making in\nsmart robotics.\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t have to be used only for robotic vehicles that move around,\u201d\nPinosky said. \u201cIt also could be used for stationary robots \u2014 such as a robotic\narm in a kitchen that learns how to load the dishwasher. As tasks and physical\nenvironments become more complicated, the role of embodiment becomes even more\ncrucial to consider during the learning process. This is an important step\ntoward real systems that do more complicated, more interesting tasks.\u201d\n\nThe study, \u201cMaximum diffusion reinforcement learning,\u201d was supported by the\nU.S. Army Research Office (grant number W911NF-19-1-0233) and the U.S. Office\nof Naval Research (grant number N00014-21-1-2706).\n\nFor Journalists: view the news release for media contacts and assets\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks\n\n### Redevelopment of Norris University Center\u2019s East Lawn to begin this summer\n\nApril 5, 2024\n\n### \u2018The Night Watchman\u2019 named next One Book selection\n\nApril 8, 2024\n\n### Six Northwestern faculty named 2024 Guggenheim Fellows\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\n## Related Stories\n\n### Misinformation is raging.
