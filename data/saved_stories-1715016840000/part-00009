As it pledges to plug the smouldering\ncrater, the reclusive central Asian nation is under pressure to fix its\nleaking oil and gas industry, too.\n\nIssued on: 18/06/2023 - 12:23\n\n5 min\n\nThe Darvaza Crater, dubbed the \"Gateway to Hell\", has been burning for the\npast five decades, in a potent symbol of Turkmenistan's vast gas reserves. \u00a9\nIgor Sasin, AFP\n\nBy: Gr\u00e9goire SAUVAGE\n\nAdvertising\n\nOver the past half-century, the former Soviet republic has been grappling with\na hellish leak it simply cannot plug.\n\nDeep in the desert of Karakoum, in northern Turkmenistan, the Darvaza gas\ncrater has been ablaze for the past 50 years, pumping fearsome quantities of\nmethane gas into the atmosphere.\n\nDubbed the \u201cGateway to Hell\u201d, the gaping crater has long been a rare tourist\nhot spot in a country where foreign visitors number about 6,000 a year.\n\nWith methane\u2019s greenhouse effects increasingly in the spotlight, the gas-\nbelching desert oddity has also attracted growing scrutiny from scientists and\ngovernments scrambling for ways to rein in catastrophic global warming.\n\n## A Soviet desert mystery\n\nAt 70 metres (229ft) wide and 20 metres deep, the smouldering Darvaza Crater\nis a surreal sight in an otherwise barren landscape. Its origin remains one of\nthe former Soviet Union\u2019s best-kept secrets.\n\nThe most widely accepted account points to a drilling operation gone awry back\nin 1971.\n\nSoviet engineers, the story goes, were gauging the site\u2019s oil reserves when\nthey hit a gas cavern, causing the earth to collapse and releasing vast\nquantities of natural gas. With the site both hazardous and inoperable, the\nengineers decided to set it alight, planning to exhaust the cavern\u2019s gas\nreserves in a matter of weeks \u2013 or so they thought.\n\nBut there are other theories, too.\n\nIn 2013, explorer George Kourounis became the first person to plumb the depths\nof the crater. In an interview with National Geographic, he said local\ngeologists had offered different accounts regarding the crater\u2019s formation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard (...) that the collapse may have happened in the 1960s and that it\nwent unlit until 1980s,\u201d Kourounis said. \u201cIt's hard for me to back that up,\nbut this is basically straight from the horse's mouth.\u201d\n\n## Tip of the iceberg\n\nSince Turkmenistan\u2019s independence in 1991, the government has regularly\nfloated plans to extinguish the \u201cGateway to Hell\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are losing valuable natural resources for which we could get significant\nprofits and use them for improving the well-being of our people,\u201d the\ncountry\u2019s former strongman leader Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov said at the start\nof 2022, shortly before handing power to his son.\n\nIn reality, this titanic enterprise has never really been a priority for a\ncountry that sits on abundant oil and gas reserves \u2013 enough to provide free\nelectricity, gas and water to its citizens over the three decades that\nfollowed independence.\n\nThis time, however, the reclusive central Asian country appears determined to\nsnuff out the blaze, with help from the United States.\n\nIn late March, Bloomberg reported that the two countries were discussing a\nplan to extinguish the fire and capture the methane released by the crater.\nThe plan would also see Washington provide much-needed investment in the\ncountry\u2019s ageing oil and gas infrastructure.\n\nWhile the spectacular \u201cGateway to Hell\u201d has attracted most attention over the\nyears, experts note that the Darvaza Crater is just the tip of the iceberg\nwhen it comes to gas leaks in Turkmenistan, one of the world\u2019s top polluters\ndespite a population of just six million.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2022, the country set an unflattering world record of 840\n\u201csuper-emitter\u201d events involving methane gas leaks from wells, storage sites\nand pipelines, according to satellite data supplied by the French start-up\nKarryos, whose efforts to monitor methane emissions around the world have\nexposed the staggering environmental cost of Turkmenistan\u2019s oil and gas\nindustry.\n\n## An environmental nightmare\n\nLast year, methane leaks from Turkmenistan\u2019s two main fossil fuel fields\ncaused more global warming than the entire carbon emissions of the United\nKingdom, Karryos data revealed.\n\n\u201cUntil recently, we had little or no visibility on the subject,\u201d said the\nstart-up\u2019s founder Antoine Rostand. \u201cNow we know that Turkmenistan, but also\nIraq, the United States and Russia, are among the countries whose oil and gas\nsector emit the largest quantities of methane.\u201d\n\nIn Turkmenistan\u2019s case, Rostand said the problem stemmed from a lack\nenvironmental standards and poor infrastructure maintenance. He noted that\nleaked natural gas is almost 100 times more polluting than flared \u2013 or burnt \u2013\nmethane.\n\nMethane is the second most abundant gas in the atmosphere after CO2, and\nalthough it is less persistent in the air, its warming potential is around 80\ntimes greater over a 20-year period. Leaks from fossil fuel installations\nsometimes stretch over several weeks, amounting to short-term climate bombs.\n\nIn an interview with FRANCE 24 last year, Euan Nisbet, a climate scientist at\nRoyal Holloway University, pointed to an \u201cextreme and unexpected increase in\natmospheric methane\u201d over the previous two years, describing the trend as\n\u201cparticularly worrying\u201d.\n\n\u201cCompared with CO2, molecule by molecule, methane is much more harmful to our\nclimate,\u201d Nisbet added.\n\n## Cheap and effective\n\nEarlier this week, Turkmenistan\u2019s new President Serdar Berdimuhamedov unveiled\na road map of measures aimed at tackling the country\u2019s colossal gas leaks.\n\nThe initiative paves the way for the country to join 150 others that have\nalready signed the Global Methane Pledge \u2013 negotiated at the COP26 climate\nsummit in Glasgow \u2013 to cut global methane emissions by 30% by 2030.\n\n01:49\n\nThe road map includes stepping up cooperation with foreign partners and the\nUN\u2019s International Methane Emissions Observatory (Imeo), a move the agency\u2019s\nhead Manfredi Caltagirone described as \u201cencouraging\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut after the announcements, the real work starts to actually cut emissions,\u201d\nthe Imeo chief cautioned in an interview with the UK\u2019s Guardian newspaper.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning\n\nSubscribe\n\nClimate experts note that tackling methane gas leaks could deliver rapid and\nconcrete results in the battle against global warming \u2013 without requiring\nmajor technological advances.\n\n\u201cAccording to our estimates, halving the number of methane \u2018super-emitter'\nevents over the next two years would be just as effective as fitting every car\nin Europe with an electric engine,\u201d said Rostand.\n\nDespite the modest cost of plugging such leaks, the oil and gas industry,\nwhich accounts for 40% of all methane emissions, has been reluctant to take\naction, lamented the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its latest \u201cGlobal\nMethane Tracker\u201d report published in February. An investment of $100 billion \u2013\nequivalent to \u201cless than 3% of the net income received by the oil and gas\nindustry in 2022\u201d \u2013 would be sufficient to avoid three quarters of all methane\nleaks caused by the industry, the IEA wrote.\n\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC), a 45%\nreduction in methane emissions by 2030 would prevent a global temperature\nincrease of 0.3\u00b0C over the next 20 years \u2013 placing the reduction of methane\nemissions among humanity\u2019s best chances of limiting global warming.\n\nThis article was adapted from the original in French.\n\nTake international news everywhere with you!
