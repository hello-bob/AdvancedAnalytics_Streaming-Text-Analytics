These latest offerings showcase\nenhancements in Ethernet connectivity, memory, and storage options.\n\nAccording to the specs revealed, the BIGTREETECH Pi 2 and CB2 are now powered\nby the Rockchip RK3566 SoC, unlike the former BTT Pi which used the Allwinner\nH616 SoC.\n\n\u2014 ADVERTISEMENT \u2014\n\n  * RK3566 \u2014 Quad-core 64-bit Cortex-A55 (up to 1.8GHz); ARM Mali G52 2EE GPU\n\nRockchip RK3566 block diagram (click image to enlarge)\n\nIn terms of memory, the device is equipped with 2GB of LPDDR4 RAM, doubling\nthe capacity from the earlier model\u2019s 1GB DDR3L. Storage solutions are\naddressed with a 32GB eMMC module, providing a faster alternative to micro SD\nstorage, and the inclusion of an M.2 Key slot offers additional, high-speed\nstorage expansion options.\n\nBTT Pi 2 & BTT CB2 comparison tables (click image to enlarge)\n\nConnectivity has been improved with Gigabit Ethernet from the previous\n10/100Mbps ethernet, dual-band WiFi (2.4GHz and 5GHz), and Bluetooth 5.2. The\nBIGTREETECH Pi2 includes a Micro HDMI port, USB 3.0, three USB 2.0 ports, a\n40-pin GPIO header, a 2-lane CSI camera interface, and a 3.5mm audio jack,\ncatering to various peripheral and multimedia project needs.\n\nBIGTREETECH Pi 2 top view (click image to enlarge)\n\nOn the other hand, the BIGTREETECH CB2, measuring just 40mm by 55mm, offers\nsimilar connectivity options, including USB 3.0, CSI, DSI, and a PCIe 2.1\ninterface for hardware expansions. Both devices are poised to deliver robust\nperformance in compact and versatile applications.\n\nSpecifications listed for the BIGTREETECH Pi 2 include:\n\n  * Memory/Storage:\n\n    * 2GB LPDDR4\n    * 32GB eMMC\n    * 1x MicroSD card slot\n  * Display/Audio:\n\n    * 1x Micro HDMI\n    * 1x 2-line DSI\n    * 3.5mm Audio jack\n  * Camera:\n\n    * 1x 2-line CSI\n  * Connectivity:\n\n    * 1x 10/100/1000Mbps Ethernet\n    * Dual-band 2.4G/5G Wi-Fi\n    * Bluetooth 5.2\n  * Expansion:\n\n    * M.2 Key\n  * I/O Interfaces:\n\n    * 40-pin GPIO header\n  * USB:\n\n    * 1x USB 3.0 Type-A\n    * 3x USB 2.0 Type-A\n  * Power:\n\n    * 12V \u2013 24V DC\n  * Mechanical:\n\n    * 94 x 56mm\n\nFurther information\n\nBIGTREETECH has yet to release pricing details for the BIGTREETECH Pi 2 and\nBIGTREETECH CB2. These products are scheduled for official launch on April\n20th, 2024 as announced on their official Twitter account.
