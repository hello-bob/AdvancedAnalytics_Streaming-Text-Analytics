Even in bedrooms far from kitchens, concentrations\nfrequently exceed health limits while stoves are on and for hours after\nburners and ovens are turned off.\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Email\n\nBy Josie Garthwaite\n\nStanford PhD student Metta Nicholson observes a gas burner in a home where\nscientists measured air pollution as part of their data collection in\nCalifornia, Texas, Colorado, New York, and Washington, D.C. (Image credit: Rob\nJackson, Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability)\n\nHouseholds with gas or propane stoves regularly breathe unhealthy levels of\nnitrogen dioxide, a study of air pollution in U.S. homes found.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see pollutant concentrations breach health benchmarks in\nbedrooms within an hour of gas stove use, and stay there for hours after the\nstove is turned off,\u201d said Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability Professor\nRob Jackson, senior author of the May 3 study in Science Advances. Pollution\nfrom gas and propane stoves isn\u2019t just an issue for cooks or people in the\nkitchen, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the whole family\u2019s problem.\u201d\n\nAmong other negative health effects, breathing high levels of nitrogen\ndioxide, or NO2, over time can intensify asthma attacks and has been linked to\ndecreased lung development in children and early deaths.\n\nAlthough most exposure to NO2 is caused by cars and trucks burning fossil\nfuels, the researchers estimate that the mix of pollutants coming from gas and\npropane stoves overall may be responsible for as many as 200,000 current\nchildhood asthma cases. One quarter of these can be attributed to nitrogen\ndioxide alone, according to the paper\u2019s authors, who include scientists from\nCentral California Asthma Collaborative, PSE Healthy Energy, and the Harvard\nT.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\n\u201cWe found that just how much gas you burn in your stove is by far the biggest\nfactor affecting how much you\u2019re exposed. And then, after that, do you have an\neffective range hood \u2013 and do you use it?\u201d said lead study author Yannai\nKashtan, a PhD student in Earth system science.\n\n## Little room for additional exposure\n\n## Related Stories\n\nScience & Technology\n\n### Rethinking cooking with gas\n\nNatural gas stoves release methane \u2013 a potent greenhouse gas \u2013 and other\npollutants through leaks and incomplete combustion. Stanford researchers\nestimate that methane leaking from stoves inside U.S. homes has the same\nclimate impact as about 500,000 gasoline-powered cars and the stoves can\nexpose people to respiratory disease-triggering pollutants.\n\nScience & Technology\n\n### Cooking on gas stoves emits benzene\n\nAbout 47 million homes use natural gas or propane-burning cooktops and ovens.\nStanford researchers found that cooking with gas stoves can raise indoor\nlevels of the carcinogen benzene above those found in secondhand smoke.\n\nScience & Technology\n\n### Going from gas to electric has immediate benefits for climate and health\n\nAn analysis of a household electrification program in Ecuador suggests\nswitching from gas to induction stoves reduces climate emissions and\nhospitalization rates faster than previously thought.\n\nBeyond asthma cases, the long-term exposure to NO2 in American households with\ngas stoves is high enough to cause thousands of deaths each year \u2013 possibly as\nmany as 19,000 or 40% of the number of deaths linked annually to secondhand\nsmoke. This estimate is based on the researchers\u2019 new measurements and\ncalculations of how much nitrogen dioxide people breathe at home because of\ngas stoves and the best available data on deaths from long-term exposure to\noutdoor NO2, which is regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThe death toll estimate is approximate in part because it does not factor in\nthe harmful effects of repeated exposure to extremely high levels of nitrogen\ndioxide in short bursts, as occurs in homes with gas stoves. It also relies on\npast studies of health impacts from nitrogen dioxide encountered outdoors,\nwhere additional pollutants from vehicles and power plants are present.\n\nThe researchers used sensors to measure concentrations of NO2 throughout more\nthan 100 homes of various sizes, layouts, and ventilation methods, before,\nduring, and after stove use. They incorporated these measurements and other\ndata into a model powered by National Institutes for Standards and Technology\n(NIST) software known as CONTAM for simulating airflow, contaminant transport,\nand room-by-room occupant exposure in buildings. This allowed them to estimate\nnationwide averages and short-term exposures under a range of realistic\nconditions and behaviors, and cross-check model outputs against their home\nmeasurements.\n\nThe results show that nationwide, typical use of a gas or propane stove\nincreases exposure to nitrogen dioxide by an estimated 4 parts per billion,\naveraged over a year. That\u2019s three quarters of the way to the nitrogen dioxide\nexposure level that the World Health Organization recognizes as unsafe in\noutdoor air. \u201cThat\u2019s excluding all outdoor sources combined, so it makes it\nmuch more likely you\u2019re going to exceed the limit,\u201d said Kashtan.\n\n> \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see pollutant concentrations breach health benchmarks in\n> bedrooms within an hour of gas stove use, and stay there for hours after the\n> stove is turned off.\u201d\n>\n> \u2014Rob Jackson\n>\n> Professor of Earth System Science\n\n## Understanding how gas stoves affect health\n\nThe study is the latest in a series from Jackson\u2019s group at Stanford looking\nat indoor air pollution from gas stoves. Earlier studies documented the rate\nat which gas stoves emit other pollutants, including the greenhouse gas\nmethane and the carcinogen benzene. But to understand the implications of\nstove emissions for human health, the researchers needed to find out how much\npollutants spread through a home, build up, and eventually dissipate. \u201cWe\u2019re\nmoving from measuring how much pollution comes from stoves to how much\npollution people actually breathe,\u201d said Jackson, who is the Michelle and\nKevin Douglas Provostial Professor in Earth System Science.\n\nWith any fuel source, particle pollution can rise from food cooking in a hot\npan. The new research confirms that food emits little or no nitrogen dioxide\nas it cooks, however, and electric stoves produce no NO2. \u201cIt\u2019s the fuel, not\nthe food,\u201d said Jackson. \u201cElectric stoves emit no nitrogen dioxide or benzene.\nIf you own a gas or propane stove, you need to reduce pollutant exposures\nusing ventilation.\u201d\n\nColin Finnegan of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability checks a\nsimmering pot on a gas stove that does not have a range hood. Using a range\nhood that vents air to the outdoors can dramatically influence how much\nnitrogen dioxide fills the air in a home. (Image credit: Rob Jackson, Stanford\nDoerr School of Sustainability)\n\n## Home size matters\n\nEven in larger homes, concentrations of nitrogen dioxide routinely spiked to\nunhealthy levels during and after cooking even if a range hood was on and\nventing air outdoors. But people who live in homes smaller than 800 square\nfeet \u2013 about the size of a small two-bedroom apartment \u2013 are exposed to twice\nas much nitrogen dioxide over the course of a year compared to the national\naverage, and four times more compared to those living in the largest homes,\nupwards of 3,000 square feet.\n\nBecause home size makes such a difference, there are also differences in\nexposure across racial, ethnic, and income groups. Compared to the national\naverage, the researchers found long-term NO2 exposure is 60% higher among\nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native households, and 20% higher among Black and\nHispanic or Latino households. This exposure to indoor air pollution from gas\nstoves compounds the fact that exposure to outdoor sources of nitrogen dioxide\npollution, such as vehicle exhaust, is also typically higher among people in\npoorer, often minority, communities.\n\n\u201cPeople in poorer communities can\u2019t always afford to change their appliances,\nor perhaps they rent and can\u2019t replace appliances because they don\u2019t own\nthem,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cPeople in smaller homes are also breathing more\npollution for the same stove use.\u201d\n\nJackson is also a senior fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the\nEnvironment and Precourt Institute for Energy.
