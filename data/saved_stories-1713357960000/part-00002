Take, for example, the hands that weave the intimate narrative of\nyoung motherhood in the small canvas The Cradle, 1872, a masterpiece of\nabsorbing gestures by Berthe Morisot, the only female artist invited to\nparticipate in the inaugural exhibition of French Impressionist work, which\nopened 150 years ago in Paris on 15 April 1874. A portrait of Morisot's sister\nEdma, lost in contemplation as she gazes down on her newborn daughter,\nBlanche, The Cradle is an onion of a painting \u2013 its alluring, if unreachable,\nessence swaddled in layers of semi-lucent veils that our eyes can never fully\nunpeel.\n\nGetty Images\n\nWith The Cradle, 1872, Morisot attempted a new representation of childhood \u2013\nand motherhood (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nThough less well-known than works contributed to that era-defining show by her\nmale counterparts \u2013 including paintings by Claude Monet and Edgar Degas,\nCamille Pissarro and Paul C\u00e9zanne \u2013 Morisot's The Cradle is key to\nappreciating just how revolutionary the consciousness of Impressionism was.\nThe painting reveals the ways in which Impressionism's temperament and\ntechniques challenged the sensibilities of the powerful Salon, the official\nart exhibition of the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts in Paris that had routinely\nrejected many of the emerging artists' work.\n\nThe apparent placidity of The Cradle, which, at first glance, exudes a nursery\ncalm, is only superficially serene. Look deeper and it is lit from inside by\nan inner angst whose urgency was unprecedented in art. The divergence in\nEdma's hands \u2013 one supporting the weight of her weary head while the other\nfidgets with the hem of a delicate voile that softens the light falling on her\nbaby as she rests \u2013 creates an edgy energy in the work. The young mother's\nhands are pulling her, and us, in two directions.\n\nIt is the psychological complexity of The Cradle, its commitment to capturing\nthe challenges of motherhood, that is so modern and moving\n\nLike Morisot, Edma too had trained informally to become a painter before she\nmarried a naval officer, Adolphe Pontillon, and shifted her focus to starting\na family. Edma's misgivings about abandoning art to become a mother are\nevident from poignant letters she later wrote to Berthe, confessing that she\noften found herself slipping away to breathe the varnished air of the studio\nthat they once shared together.\n\nGetty Images\n\nMorisot's portrayal of the mother and child was psychologically nuanced,\nrather than a straightforward depiction (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nIt is difficult not to see in the tense twiddle of Edma's fingertips a\nrepressed urge to rip aside the veils that keep us from the possibilities of\nour latent selves. Morisot's virtuosity in weaving variable densities of\ndiaphanous fabric from the pigments on her palette, thereby sieving our eyes'\naccess to what lies beyond, is as captivating as anything that was put on\ndisplay at that opening exhibition of some 31 Impressionist artists \u2013 an event\ncelebrated for its radical revelation of the movement's sketchy gestures,\noutdoorsy spirit, and love of light. Those qualities are there too in the 10\npaintings, pastels, and watercolours contributed to the show by Morisot, but\nit is the psychological complexity of The Cradle, its commitment to capturing\nthe challenges of motherhood, that is so modern and moving.\n\nEarly promise\n\nBorn into a bourgeois family (their father was a senior administrator of a\nprefecture in central France), the Morisot sisters were fortunate to have\ntheir interest in painting nurtured from a young age \u2013 a rare advantage for\naspiring female artists of the time. When they weren't honing their skills in\na private studio that was provided for them, they were learning to translate\nthe language of light outdoors from the celebrated landscape painter Camille\nCorot, who was retained as their tutor. It wasn't long before word was out\nabout the sisters' remarkable promise. \u00c9douard Manet's early esteem for their\nability is crystallised in his rather dispiriting comment, all too telling of\nits time, that \"it is a pity they are not men\".\n\nGetty Images\n\nIn Repose (1871), Manet showed Morisot in an unconventional, informal posture\n(Credit: Getty Images)\n\nThere is empathy in Manet's lament that the sisters' gender would work against\nthem and unmistakable admiration in the dozen portraits that he would go on to\npaint of Berthe, whose hands, in particular, he handled with care. In 1871,\nthe year before Morisot painted The Cradle, Manet caused something of a stir\nwith his portrayal of her in a posture rather too relaxed for many\ncontemporary eyes. In The Repose, Morisot's hands are seen variously clutching\nthe stiff extent of a closed fan and resting weightlessly on the inviting\nvelvet couch on which she lounges.\n\nMore like this:\n\nThe key to unlocking Banksy's latest mural\n\nThe powerful paintings reframing black experience\n\nThe masterpieces that helped Henry VIII pick wives\n\nThat same year, Morisot (who would go on to marry Manet's brother, Eug\u00e8ne)\nwould try her own hand at the mystery of hands in a solo likeness of Edma, her\nPortrait of Madame Pontillon, in which her sister is depicted wearing a dark,\nfunereal dress and an inscrutable expression. The apparent placidity of the\npastel work, which also featured in the first Impressionist show held in the\nworkshop of the French photographer Nadar, is once again unsettled by the\nfidget of fingers. Here, her sister's hands, formerly folded in her lap, are\non the move, the right one starting to wriggle up her left wrist with a mind\nof its own. She has something up her sleeve \u2013 a secret that has our eyes\neating out of her hands.\n\nGetty Images\n\nMorisot's Portrait of Madame Pontillon (1871) also hints at a restlessness in\nEdma's hands (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nNot everyone was sold on Morisot's dexterity with digits. The crotchety\ncontemporary critic Louis Leroy, reviewing the exhibition for the satirical\nmagazine Le Charivari, manhandled Morisot's hands. \"Now take Mademoiselle\nMorisot!\", Leroy wrote scornfully of the emerging artist, still in her early\nthirties: \"That young lady is not interested in reproducing trifling details.\nWhen she has a hand to paint she makes exactly as many brushstrokes lengthwise\nas there are fingers and the business is done. Stupid people who are finicky\nabout the drawing of a hand don't understand a thing about impressionism.\" It\nwas Leroy, of course, who, in this same review, sought to smear the broken\nbrushstrokes used by many of the artists in the show by dubbing them\n\"impressionists\" \u2013 an intended slur that backfired when the group proudly\nembraced the name.\n\nLeroy's mocking coinage of the term \"impressionism\" was inspired by the title\nthat Claude Monet himself had attached to a glimmering dawnscape, Impression,\nSunrise, 1872 \u2013 the painting that, to this day, remains the single-most adored\nand discussed canvas from that groundbreaking show. Unlike Monet's better-\nknown canvas, which arrestingly suspends the apricot shimmer of harbour water\non the edge of his hometown, Le Havre, Morisot's portrayal of the inspections\nand introspections of motherhood is without obvious precedent.\n\nGetty Images\n\nWhile Monet's Impression, Sunrise (1872) gave the movement its name and was\npraised as pioneering, it took inspiration from the work of JMW Turner\n(Credit: Getty Images)\n\nThough Monet had the audacity to present his fungible forms fragmenting into\nlyrical light as a finished work, rather than a study or sketch, the loose\nluminosity that vibrates from his canvas is not, in fact, without antecedent.\nIts inchoate incandescence is anticipated by the temper and tone of British\nartist JMW Turner's late canvases from three decades earlier, works on which\nMonet meditated while living in London just prior to painting Impression,\nSunrise. While there is no shortage of mother-and-childs in art history,\nhowever, Morisot's is tuned to a fresh frequency.\n\nAugmenting The Cradle's impact on the fiery red walls of the first\nImpressionist show, if only by chance, was the shocking context in which the\npainting would have been experienced by visitors. Although the placement of\nworks in Nadar's converted workshop was decided by the drawing of lots by\nparticipating artists, the decision to hang The Cradle, with its all tensions\nand tendernesses of parenthood and infancy, side-by-side with a titillating\nportrayal of the instant that a prostitute in a bordello is unwrapped by a\nmaid for the lewd pleasure of a leering man, must surely rank as among the\nmost dubious in the history of exhibiting art. That said, the adjacency of\nMorisot's work with C\u00e9zanne's provocatively erotic A Modern Olympia \u2013 a\nreimagining of an earlier, scandalous canvas by Manet (which was itself a\nrisqu\u00e9 reinvention of a painting by Titian), creates a fascinating friction of\nprogressive visions.\n\nGetty Images\n\nC\u00e9zanne's A Modern Olympia (1874) was painted in response an 1863 painting by\nManet that had caused a scandal at the 1865 state-run Salon (Credit: Getty\nImages)\n\nFor their impact, both works rely on life's theatre of endless veiling, and on\npresenting the painter as a daring discloser of deep truths. In the years that\nfollowed the first Impressionist exhibition, both artists' hands would\ncontinue to experiment with stripping form of its formalism while reinventing\nthe contours of colour and light. C\u00e9zanne's achievements would earn him the\nadulation of artistic heirs, inspiring Cubism and much else, while Morisot's\nwould remain overshadowed. Though more recent years have seen, with the\nstaging of thoughtful retrospectives, a concerted effort to draw back the\ncurtain on Morisot's genius, hers is a hand still plucking at the edge of\ncultural consciousness \u2013 still waiting fully to be grasped.\n\n\\--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a\nhandpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your\ninbox every Friday.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on\nBBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nArt history\n\nFeatures\n\nRelated\n\n## The childhood WW2 trauma that inspired Yoko Ono\n\n15 Feb 2024\n\nCulture\n\n## What the purple dress in Oprah's portrait means\n\n14 Dec 2023\n\nCulture\n\n## The masterpieces that helped Henry VIII pick wives\n\n6 Dec 2023\n\nCulture\n\nMore\n\n11 hrs ago\n\n## One of the most spectacular drives in Cuba\n\nFew travellers venture to Cuba's south-eastern corner, but a little-known road\noffers a fascinating \u2013 and stunning \u2013 glimpse of the nation's revolutionary\npast.\n\n11 hrs ago\n\nTravel\n\n15 hrs ago\n\n## What happens when teenage girls 'run' a government\n\nNew documentary film Girls State \u2013 a follow-up to the acclaimed 2020\ndocumentary Boys State \u2013 explores the current, hyper-polarised moment in US\npolitics.\n\n15 hrs ago\n\nCulture\n\n15 hrs ago\n\n## Canada's remote bike-in mountain lodge\n\nSet in one of Banff National Park's most stunning locations, these historical\ncabins are only accessible to those who hike, ski, snowshoe or bike in.\n\n15 hrs ago\n\nTravel\n\n16 hrs ago\n\n## GE Aerospace's 'simple formula for success'\n\nAziz Koleilat, GE Aerospace's general manager, enters the BBC's Executive\nLounge to talk about how international thinking breeds innovation.\n\n16 hrs ago\n\nWorklife\n\n19 hrs ago\n\n## How tree justice could change US cities\n\nTrees protect health and lower bills: planting them in tree-poor communities\nof colour can have the greatest impact.\n\n19 hrs ago\n\nFuture\n\n## Let us know you agree to cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best online experience.\n\nPlease let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.\n\n  * No, take me to settings\n\n", "frontpage": false}
