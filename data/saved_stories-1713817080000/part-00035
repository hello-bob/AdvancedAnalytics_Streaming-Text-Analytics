The final published\nrelease of FoxPro was 2.6. Development continued under the Visual FoxPro\nlabel, which in turn was discontinued in 2007.\n\nFoxPro was derived from FoxBase (Fox Software, Perrysburg, Ohio), which was in\nturn derived from dBase III (Ashton-Tate) and dBase II. dBase II was the first\ncommercial version of a database program written by Wayne Ratliff, called\nVulcan, running on CP/M, as does dBase II.^[1]\n\nFoxPro was both a DBMS and a relational database management system (RDBMS),\nsince it extensively supported multiple relationships between multiple DBF\nfiles (tables). However, it lacked transactional processing.\n\nFoxPro was sold and supported by Microsoft after they acquired Fox Software in\nits entirety in 1992. At that time there was an active worldwide community of\nFoxPro users and programmers. FoxPro 2.6 for UNIX (FPU26) has even been\nsuccessfully installed on Linux and FreeBSD using the Intel Binary\nCompatibility Standard (ibcs2) support library.\n\n## Version information[edit]\n\n### Operating system compatibility[edit]\n\nExtant Versions by OSVersion| FP 2.0| FP 2.5| FP 2.6  \n---|---|---|---  \nMS-DOS| Yes| Yes| Yes  \nWindows 3.1 to 7 Ultimate sp1| Yes| Yes| Yes  \nMacintosh| Yes| Yes| Yes  \nSCO UNIX| Yes| Yes| Yes  \nLinux and FreeBSD| Yes| Yes| Yes^[2]  \nWindows 2000| No| No| Yes  \n  \n### Technical aspects[edit]\n\nFoxPro 2 included the \"Rushmore\" optimizing engine, which used indices to\naccelerate data retrieval and updating. Rushmore technology examined every\ndata-related statement and looked for filter expressions. If one was used, it\nlooked for an index matching the same expression.\n\nFoxPro 2 was originally built on Watcom C/C++, which used the DOS/4GW memory\nextender to access expanded and extended memory. It could also use almost all\navailable RAM even if no HIMEM.SYS was loaded.\n\n### Version timeline[edit]\n\nVersion| VERSION() returns| EXE Size| EXE Date  \n---|---|---|---  \nFPW 2.6a| FoxPro 2.6a for Windows| 2,444 kb| 28 September 1994  \nFPM 2.6a| FoxPro 2.6a for Macintosh| ? kb| August 1994  \nFPD 2.6a| FoxPro 2.6a for DOS| 1,788 kb| August 1994  \nFPW 2.6| FoxPro 2.6 for Windows| 2.52 Mb| 9 March 1994  \nFPM 2.6| FoxPro 2.6 for Macintosh| ? kb| 1993  \nFPD 2.6| FoxPro 2.6 for DOS| 1.83 Mb| March 1994  \nFPU 2.6| FoxPro 2.6 for Unix| 2.3 Mb| 1993  \nFPW 2.5| FoxPro 2.5 for Windows| 1.63 Mb| January 1993  \nFPD 2.5| FoxPro 2.5 for DOS| 509,013 bytes| February 1993  \nFPD 2.0| FoxPro 2.0 for DOS| 488.656 kb| July 1992  \nFPD 1.0| FoxPro 1.0 for DOS| 343.200 kb| November 1991  \n  \n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ a CP/M set released in 1982\n  2. ^ using the ibcs files from the Linux ABI on SourceForge\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n  * History of FoxPro - Timeline\n  * A site devoted to the history of FoxPro\n\n  * v\n  * t\n  * e\n\nxBase programming language  \n---  \nImplementations|\n\n  * dBase\n  * DBFree\n  * Clipper\n  * Visual Objects\n  * FoxPro\n  * Visual FoxPro\n  * Harbour Project\n  * XBase++\n  * xHarbour\n  * Vulcan.NET\n  * MaxScript\n  * VP-Info\n  * XSharp\n  * PWCT\n\n  \nIDE|\n\n  * HBIDE\n  * dBase\n  * Visual Objects\n  * XIDE\n\n  \n  \nRetrieved from\n\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=FoxPro&oldid=1190750564\"\n\nCategories:\n\n  * Fourth-generation programming languages\n  * 1984 software\n  * Data-centric programming languages\n  * XBase programming language family\n  * Procedural programming languages\n  * Proprietary database management systems\n  * Microsoft development tools\n  * Microsoft database software\n\nHidden categories:\n\n  * Articles with short description\n  * Short description matches Wikidata\n  * Use dmy dates from December 2023\n\n  * This page was last edited on 19 December 2023, at 16:58 (UTC).\n  * Text is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0; additional terms may apply.
