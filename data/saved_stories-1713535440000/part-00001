All its current\nreactors are of Soviet design but it has shifted them to US fuel.\n\nThe country's largest nuclear plant -- Zaporizhzhia in the south -- has been\nunder Russian control since the start of the war.\n\nKhmelnytskyi power plant already has two functioning reactors. Its reactors 3\nand 4 are partially built to a Soviet design.\n\nThe ground-breaking ceremony was for unbuilt reactors 5 and 6, which will be\nbuilt using Westinghouse's AP1000 technology.\n\nThe units will each have a capacity of over 1,100 megawatts and according to\nFragman will be \"the most advanced nuclear reactor operating today in the\nworld\".\n\nWith all six reactors on stream, Khmelnytskyi will become Europe's largest\nplant, topping Zaporizhzhia, said Energoatom chief Petro Kotin.\n\nEnergoAtom and Westinghouse did not say exactly when the reactors will come on\nline.\n\nEnergoatom said construction of one reactor unit in peace time takes five\nyears and the estimated cost starts from $ five billion.\n\nThe first unit will be on an \"accelerated schedule\", because Ukraine has\nagreed to buy heavy equipment that is ready to instal, Fragman said.\n\nThe US Exim Bank will partly finance the project.\n\n##### Barron's Newsletters\n\n### The Barron's Daily\n\nA morning briefing on what you need to know in the day ahead, including\nexclusive commentary from Barron's and MarketWatch writers.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nYou have been successfully subscribed to The Barron's Daily.
