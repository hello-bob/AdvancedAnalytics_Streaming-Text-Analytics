They oversaw the construction of the International Space Station.\nNow, with the shuttle's retirement, these princely figures in the human\nspaceflight community were tasked with selecting a replacement vehicle to send\nastronauts to the orbiting laboratory.\n\nBoeing was the easy favorite. The majority of engineers and other participants\nin the meeting argued that Boeing alone should win a contract worth billions\nof dollars to develop a crew capsule. Only toward the end did a few voices\nspeak up in favor of a second contender, SpaceX. At the meeting's conclusion,\nNASA's chief of human spaceflight at the time, William Gerstenmaier, decided\nto hold off on making a final decision.\n\nA few months later, NASA publicly announced its choice. Boeing would receive\n$4.2 billion to develop a \"commercial crew\" transportation system, and SpaceX\nwould get $2.6 billion. It was not a total victory for Boeing, which had\nlobbied hard to win all of the funding. But the company still walked away with\nnearly two-thirds of the money and the widespread presumption that it would\neasily beat SpaceX to the space station.\n\nThe sense of triumph would prove to be fleeting. Boeing decisively lost the\ncommercial crew space race, and it proved to be a very costly affair.\n\nWith Boeing's Starliner spacecraft finally due to take flight this week with\nastronauts on board, we know the extent of the loss, both in time and money.\nDragon first carried people to the space station nearly four years ago. In\nthat span, the Crew Dragon vehicle has flown thirteen public and private\nmissions to orbit. Because of this success, Dragon will end up flying 14\noperational missions to the station for NASA, earning a tidy fee each time,\ncompared to just six for Starliner. Through last year, Boeing has taken $1.5\nbillion in charges due to delays and overruns with its spacecraft development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what happened? How did Boeing, the gold standard in human spaceflight for\ndecades, fall so far behind on crew? This story, based largely on interviews\nwith unnamed current and former employees of Boeing and contractors who worked\non Starliner, attempts to provide some answers.\n\n## The early days\n\nWhen the contracts were awarded, SpaceX had the benefit of working with NASA\nto develop a cargo variant of Dragon, which by 2014 was flying regular\nmissions to the space station. But the company had no experience with human\nspaceflight. Boeing, by contrast, had decades of spaceflight experience, but\nit had to start from scratch with Starliner.\n\nEach faced a deeper cultural challenge. A decade ago, SpaceX was deep into\nseveral major projects, including developing a new version of the Falcon 9\nrocket, flying more frequently, experimenting with landing and reuse, and\ndoing cargo supply missions. This new contract meant more money but a lot more\nwork. A NASA engineer who worked closely with both SpaceX and Boeing in this\ntime frame recalls visiting SpaceX and the atmosphere being something like a\nfrenzied graduate school, where all of the employees were being pulled in\ndifferent directions. Getting engineers to focus on Crew Dragon was difficult.\n\nBut at least SpaceX was in its natural environment. Boeing's space division\nhad never won a large fixed-price contract. Its leaders were used to operating\nin a cost-plus environment, in which Boeing could bill the government for all\nof its expenses and earn a fee. Cost overruns and delays were not the\ncompany's problem\u2014they were NASA's. Now Boeing had to deliver a flyable\nspacecraft for a firm, fixed price.\n\nBoeing struggled to adjust to this environment. When it came to complicated\nspace projects, Boeing was used to spending other people's money. Now, every\npenny spent on Starliner meant one less penny in profit (or, ultimately,\ngreater losses). This meant that Boeing allocated fewer resources to Starliner\nthan it needed to thrive.\n\n\"The difference between the two company\u2019s cultures, design philosophies, and\ndecision-making structures allowed SpaceX to excel in a fixed-price\nenvironment, where Boeing stumbled, even after receiving significantly more\nfunding,\" said Lori Garver in an interview. She was deputy administrator of\nNASA from 2009 to 2013 during the formative years of the commercial crew\nprogram and is the author of Escaping Gravity.\n\nSo Boeing faced financial pressure from the beginning. At the same time, it\nwas confronting major technical challenges. Building a human spacecraft is\nvery difficult. Some of the biggest hurdles would be flight software and\npropulsion.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n22\n\nEric Berger Eric Berger is the senior space editor at Ars Technica, covering\neverything from astronomy to private space to wonky NASA policy, and author of\nthe book Liftoff, about the rise of SpaceX.
