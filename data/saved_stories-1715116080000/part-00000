Many\nnanoparticle-based drug delivery systems have been investigated for this, but\nmost suffer from poor gut stability, poor mucus diffusion and/or inefficient\nepithelial uptake. Extracellular vesicles from bovine milk (mEVs) possess\ndesirable characteristics for oral delivery of nucleic acid therapies since\nthey both survive digestion and traverse the intestinal mucosa.\n\n### Results\n\nUsing novel tools, we comprehensively examine the intestinal delivery of mEVs,\nprobing whether they could be used as, or inform the design of, nanoparticles\nfor oral nucleic acid therapies. We show that mEVs efficiently translocate\nacross the Caco-2 intestinal model, which is not compromised by treatment with\nsimulated intestinal fluids. For the first time, we also demonstrate transport\nof mEVs in novel 3D \u2018apical-out\u2019 and monolayer-based human intestinal\nepithelial organoids (IEOs). Importantly, mEVs loaded with small interfering\nRNA (siRNA) induced (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, GAPDH) gene\nsilencing in macrophages. Using inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as an example\napplication, we show that administration of anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha\n(TNF\u03b1) siRNA-loaded mEVs reduced inflammation in a IBD rat model.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nTogether, this work demonstrates that mEVs could either act as natural and\nsafe systems for oral delivery or nucleic acid therapies, or inform the design\nof synthetic systems for such application.\n\n### Graphical Abstract\n\n## Background\n\nIngestion is the most desirable drug administration route. In addition to\noffering significant benefits in terms of access to medicines and patient\nconvenience, oral administration is also amenable to effective local drug\ndelivery in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) as part of therapeutic management\nof GIT diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Nanomedicine-based\napproaches have been investigated for oral delivery of nucleic acid therapies\nin intestinal inflammation [1,2,3], but most synthetic nanoparticles tend to\nsuffer from poor stability in, and inefficient penetration across, the\nchallenging biochemical and physical barriers of the GIT [4].\n\nAll cells export part of their proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids into the\nextracellular space via the release of various types of extracellular vesicles\n(EVs), which play a crucial role in intercellular communication. As part of\ntheir role of cargo transfer between cells, EVs are highly capable of crossing\nbiological barriers. Because of this property, EVs, and particularly exosomes\n(a subtype of EVs), have attracted significant interest as potential drug\ndelivery systems [5]. EVs isolated from bovine milk (mEVs) are potentially\nhighly interesting systems for delivery of drugs with poor oral\nbioavailability, such as biologics. Based on observations that mEVs exert\nbioactivity, both locally in the GIT and systemically, it is thought that they\nboth survive the hostile conditions in the GIT [6, 7] and translocate across\nthe human intestinal mucosa [8,9,10].\n\nInterestingly, mEVs per se have been investigated for their therapeutic\npotential in IBD and were found to ameliorate colitis in a murine model of the\ndisease [11]. This therapeutic effect of mEVs is thought to arise from\nbeneficial micro RNA (miRNA) and cytokine cargo, such as miRNA-148 [12] and\ntransforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2, an immune-suppressive cytokine) [13].\nWhile this early indication of therapeutic potential of native mEVs needs to\nbe confirmed in more human-relevant animal models (and ultimately humans),\nhere we used innovative in vitro approaches, including a state-of-the-art\nmodel of the human intestinal epithelium, to examine the utility of mEVs as\npotential vehicles, or models of nanoparticles, for oral delivery of nucleic\nacid therapies.\n\nWe initially examined the interaction of mEVs with the key drug delivery\nbarriers in the intestine, namely the intestinal biofluid and epithelium,\nfollowed by probing their potential for oral delivery of biologics in IBD\n(using siRNA as exemplar therapeutic). mEVs were isolated and characterized,\nincluding in the presence of simulated intestinal fluids. Intestinal cell\nuptake and transport of mEVs was then confirmed in Caco-2 cells as an\nestablished in vitro intestinal model, together with assessing the effect of\nsimulated intestinal fluid on their epithelial transport. Importantly, using\nnovel intestinal epithelial organoid (IEOs) models of the human intestinal\nepithelium, we demonstrate epithelial translocation of mEVs in this highly\nbiorelevant intestinal epithelial model. We show that mEVs efficiently\ntransport across Caco-2 cells, which was not affected by their treatment with\nsimulated intestinal fluids. We further demonstrate apical-to-basolateral\ntranslocation of mEVs in two separate human tissue derived IEO models, which\nwere, unconventionally, cultured with an exposed apical surface. When loaded\nwith a model siRNA molecule (anti glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase,\nGAPDH) by electroporation, mEVs induced gene silencing in a macrophage cell\nline, which was employed here given the central role of these immune system\ncells in mediating inflammation in IBD. Finally, a proof-of-concept in vivo\nstudy utilising anti-TNF\u03b1 siRNA loaded mEVs demonstrated their ability to\nreduce inflammation in a rat model of IBD. This work therefore clearly\nhighlights that mEVs could serve as highly effective carriers or inform the\ndesign of bio-inspired synthetic systems for oral delivery of nucleic acid\ntherapies.\n\n## Results and discussion\n\n### mEV isolation and characterization\n\nmEVs were initially characterized for size (Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and\nNanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA)) and surface charge. These parameters are\nsummarized in Table 1. The size of isolated mEVs falls within the range of\nthose reported previously [13]. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was\nused to image the morphology of mEVs. Additional file 1: Fig. S1A depicts the\ntypical cup-shaped structure of mEVs under negative staining [14]. Determining\nthe expression of mEV protein markers (via the Exo-CheckTM Array kit),\nAdditional file 1: Fig. S1B shows that the general markers of EVs such as\nCD63, CD81, ICAM (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1) and TSG101 (Tumor\nSusceptibility Gene 101) were expressed in mEVs, while ALIX (ALG-2-interacting\nprotein X) is not apparent (this protein exists in EVs from colostrum and not\nmature milk [15]). Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), which is often\nfound in cancer-derived EVs, was also not apparent in mEVs.\n\nTable 1 Physicochemical parameters of bovine milk extracellular vesicles\n\nFull size table\n\n### Transport of mEVs across Caco-2 monolayers\n\nInitial studies of intestinal transport of mEVs were carried out in Caco-2\nmonolayers as a commonly employed intestinal epithelial model. Comparisons\nwere made with liposomes of similar size (~ 100 nm), as well as the\nfluorescent dye alone which was used to label mEVs. Additional file 1: Fig. S2\nshows that the extent of transport was notably higher for mEVs compared to\nliposomes (over an order of magnitude) or the dye alone.\n\n### Effect of intestinal fluids on mEV membrane stability and intestinal\ntransport\n\nPrior to studying the intestinal epithelial transport of mEVs in advanced and\nhighly realistic intestinal models, we determined their stability in\nintestinal fluids, via size, and surface charge measurements. We intentionally\nfocused on intestinal rather than gastric fluids given that the most\nappropriate way in which mEVs or mEV-like synthetic delivery systems would be\nadministered orally is via enteric-coated capsules so to ensure that membrane-\nassociated proteins of mEVs are protected in the harsh environment of stomach\nbiofluid.\n\nThere is evidence that cargo in mEVs (e.g. microRNAs) remains protected\nagainst degradation by low pH, RNases and treatment that mimics digestion in\nthe GIT [6, 7]. However, studies reporting on the stability of mEVs and their\ncontent in the gut (which mainly come from the field of nutrition) tend to\nexpose milk, rather than isolated EVs, to digestive conditions [6]. Figure 1A\nshows that while mEVs treated with fasted state simulated intestinal fluid\n(FaSSIF) displayed a similar size to those in PBS, fed state simulated\nintestinal fluid (FeSSIF) treatment resulted in a decreased diameter of mEVs.\nThe surface charge (Z-potential) of mEVs was not compromised by simulated\nintestinal fluids (SIFs) digestion (Fig. 1B). This observation is similar to\nthe findings reported by Kokkona et al. [16] on the effect of sodium cholate\non the mean diameter of liposomes containing phosphatidylcholine and\ncholesterol, which decreased by approximately 20% in the presence of sodium\ncholate.\n\nWe next sought to understand whether the ability of mEVs to translocate across\nthe intestinal epithelium is compromised upon treatment with SIFs. Figure 1C\nshows the transport of mEVs, post-treatment with SIFs, across\npolarised/differentiated Caco-2 monolayers. In all three groups, mEVs showed a\nremarkable ability to permeate across the Caco-2 monolayers. Interestingly,\nFeSSIF-treated mEVs possessed a slightly higher transport through the\nmonolayers compared to FaSSIF-treated and untreated control. Specifically,\napproximately, 18% of FeSSIF-treated mEVs translocated across cell monolayers\nin 90 min, while FaSSIF-treated and untreated control showed a lower level of\ntranslocation, amounting to 10% of applied mEVs after 90 min. The calculated\nrate of mEV transport across intestinal epithelial monolayers was 12.0, 6.7\nand 7.9% per hour for FeSSIF-treated, FaSSIF-treated and untreated mEVs,\nrespectively, with the difference between FeSSIF-treated and untreated mEVs\nbeing statistically significant (p = 0.026). It is presently unclear why the\ntransport rate of mEV across Caco-2 monolayers for FeSSIF-treated group was\nhigher than that for FaSSIF-treated and control groups, although it may be\nrelated to the observed effect of FeSSIF on the size of mEVs.\n\nIt is noted that the SIFs employed in this work are simple models of the\nintestinal biofluid, which do not fully represent their composition. As such,\nthey are derived of vital intraluminal components; for example, whilst native\nhuman intestinal fluid harbours a variety of bile salts, the SIFs used here\ncomprise pure sodium taurocholate only [17]. These fluids additionally fail to\nreplicate the intricate ultrastructure of postprandial human intestinal fluid\n(which includes mixed micelles and vesicles), likely due to the absence of\nlipids and lipolysis products. Furthermore, the intestinal movement and\nenzymatic degradation of food (which impact colloid formation) within the\ngastrointestinal tract are unaccounted for [18, 19]. Although this study\nsupports previous evidence on the stability of mEVs in the GIT, ultimate\nevidence of the ability of mEVs to survive digestion should come from in vivo\nstudies in the future.\n\nFig. 1\n\nEffect of simulated intestinal fluids on bovine milk extracellular vesicles\n(mEVs).

The representation of all types of\nterminally differentiated intestinal epithelial cells, which serve important\nfunctions in barrier regulation, material absorption, mucus secretion,\ninteraction with microbiota, gut-brain communication and host defense [21], is\na key advantage of IEOs over cell line alternatives for modelling the\nintestinal epithelium. To evaluate the transport of mEVs across IEOs, we first\ncultured these using a typical culture condition, and using DAPT, we induced\ndifferentiation of IEOs so to promote the production of mucus (Additional file\n1: Fig. S3) [22]. However, conventional culture of IEOs currently limits their\napplication in the field of drug delivery since the apical/luminal side is not\naccessible by the user. To overcome this obstacle, recent studies have\nreported the culture of IEOs with exposed apical surface. To this end, a few\nstudies have reported the culture of 3D apical-out human enteroids [22, 23].\nHowever, to the best of our knowledge, IEOs have not previously been used to\nstudy the intestinal translocation of EVs, or indeed any other nanoparticles.\n\nBased on a modified method reported by Co et al., we initially cultured 3D\nIEOs derived colon tissue with reversed polarity [22, 23]. The process of\nachieving successful in vitro culture of apical-out IEOs is shown in Fig. 2A.\nConfocal imaging revealed that when compared to normal basal-out IEOs, which\nhave apical tight junction ZO-1 proteins expression in the interior of the\ncell clusters, in apical-out IEOs apical ZO-1 is distributed on the surface of\nIEOs clusters, facing outward (Fig. 2B, C), which confirmed the successful\ndevelopment of 3D apical-out IEOs model. We then applied fluorescently\nlabelled mEVs to the apical-out IEOs model for four hours, followed by\nconfocal imaging of uptake (Fig. 2D). In these systems, the fluorescence\nsignal (red) of mEVs was clearly apparent within the interior of apical-out\nIEOs, which indicates transepithelial transport of mEVs from the exterior\nfacing the apical side of 3D IEOs into their basolateral lumen.\n\nFig. 2\n\nApical-out culture of human (biopsy-derived) colon intestinal epithelial\norganoids (IEOs) and transport of milk extracellular vesicles (mEVs).

Schematics were drawn by Figdraw\n\nFull size image\n\n### mEV transport across IEO monolayers\n\nIn addition to demonstrating apical-to-basolateral transport of mEVs in 3D\napical-out IEOs, we also determined their translocation in IEO monolayers\noriginating from different gut segments (i.e. duodenum (Duo), terminal ileum\n(TI) and sigmoid colon (SC)). 2D monolayers enable easy access to the apical\nand basolateral sides and therefore the determination of transintestinal\ntransport of material. To achieve this system, IEOs cultured in Matrigel were\nharvested for monolayer preparation at an optimized culture period,\ndissociated and single cells seeded on Transwell inserts. Additional file 1:\nFig. S4 depicts the growth of IEO monolayers over a period of seven days,\nwhereby the differentiation medium was added on day 5 and differentiated\nconfluent IEOs monolayers developed by day 7. Figure 3A shows\nimmunofluorescence staining images of Duo, TI and SC IEOs monolayers. ZO-1\nfluorescence signal displays a characteristic \u2018chicken-wire\u2019 distribution of\ntight junctions. MUC2 signal is absent in Duo and TI monolayers, while it is\nweak in SC monolayers. The formation of electrically tight monolayers was also\nconfirmed via TEER measurement. Figure 3B shows that the TEER values of Duo,\nTI and SC monolayers increased gradually with time during the first five days\nwith culture in normal growth medium, while after the addition of\ndifferentiation medium on day 5, the TEER of monolayers from all three\nintestinal regions increased significantly, reaching beyond 200 \u03a9 * cm^2. To\nprobe the barrier of IEO monolayers, we determined FD10 permeability in this\nsystem. Figure 3C shows a significantly lower permeability of FD10 across IEO\nmonolayers compared with blank (no cell) inserts (coated with diluted BME2,\nsimilarly to cell-containing counterparts), and the apparent permeability\ncoefficients (P_app) of FD10 through IEO monolayers were lower than 10^\u22127\ncm/s, which confirms the barrier integrity of monolayers. Overall, the\ndistribution of ZO-1 tight junction protein, high TEER and low permeability of\nFD10 together demonstrate the successful development of polarized Duo, TI and\nSC IEOs monolayers which are electrically tight and pose a barrier to\ntransepithelial diffusion of a model macromolecule.\n\nThe data in Fig. 3D show mEVs accumulation on the basolateral side over time,\nreaching approximately 3% and 5% after 160 min across Duo and TI IEO\nmonolayers, respectively (top). The cellular localization of mEVs following\ntheir incubation with IEO monolayers is shown on confocal images (Fig. 3D,\nbottom). The fluorescence signal associated with mEVs can be observed in the\ncell interior and across the vertical cross-sections of the monolayers, with\nmore prominent distribution of fluorescence on the apical side. The\naccumulation of red mEVs fluorescence in TI monolayers was higher than Duo\nmonolayers, which was consistent with the transport quantitation. As shown in\nFig. 3D, SC, both the quantitative transport measurement and 3D confocal\nimages show that mEVs transport across SC monolayers is the least efficient\n(compared to Duo and TI monolayers).\n\nFig. 3\n\nCulture of human intestinal epithelial organoids (IEOs) as 2D monolayers on\nTranswell inserts and epithelial transport of milk extracellular vesicle\n(mEVs). A Confocal immunofluorescent staining images of IEOs monolayers\ncultured on Transwell inserts for 8 days (differentiated at day 5),\nimmunostained for the apical zonula occludens (ZO-1) tight junction protein\n(green), MUC2 mucin (red) and cell nucleus (DAPI, blue).

D mEVs transport across IEOs\nmonolayers including transport percentage shown on the upside and 3D confocal\nimages on the bottom, where the apical side of the cells is marked by \u2018A\u2019 and\nthe basolateral side \u2018B\u2019. Nuclei appear in blue and mEVs in red. IEOs were\nderived from biopsied tissue from different regions of human gastrointestinal\nsystem (\u2018Duo\u2019: duodenum; \u2018TI\u2019: terminal ileum; and \u2018SC\u2019: sigmoid colon). Data\nshown as the mean \u00b1 SD, n = 3. ** indicates p < 0.01\n\nFull size image\n\nData in Fig. 3 confirms the intestinal epithelium crossing characteristic of\nmEVs, also demonstrated in Caco-2 monolayers (Fig. 1) and \u2018apical-out\u2019 3D IEOs\n(Fig. 2). Additionally and importantly, the data highlights that mEV transport\nacross Duo- and TI-derived IEO monolayers is significantly higher than that in\nSC-derived monolayers. Although it is relatively well established that the\nintestinal barrier is more \u2018leaky\u2019 in the small intestine compared to the\ncolon [24], attributed to differential expression of tight junctions [25], a\nmarkedly different transport profile of mEVs in SC compared to Duo and TI IEOs\ncannot be compared with the permeability of small molecular weight drugs, or\nindeed macromolecules. However, it has been reported that the permeability of\nactively transported compounds, d-glucose and l-leucine, is dramatically lower\nin the colon compared to the small intestine in a study utilizing human tissue\nin Ussing chambers [26]. This provides an interesting comparison, as although\nthe mechanisms of intestinal epithelial transport of particulate mEVs are\nexpected to be facilitated by different mechanisms to actively-transported\nmolecules, it may be the case that the lower transport of mEVs in SC is linked\nto lower expression levels of the cellular machinery involved in their\ntrafficking, although presently this is only a speculation and needs\nconfirming in future studies.\n\n### In Vitro transfection efficiency of siRNA-loaded mEVs\n\nTo establish whether mEVs could serve as potential systems for functional\nbiotherapeutic delivery, we loaded siRNA into the vesicles via\nelectroporation. The loading efficiency of siRNA into mEVs was calculated as\n5.10 \u00b1 0.55%. The gene silencing efficiency of siRNA loaded-mEVs was then\nevaluated on macrophages (J774A.1), given that macrophages in the lamina\npropria (i.e. under the epithelium) play a key role in inflammatory response\nin IBD [27] and therefore are a potential target of interest in IBD, achieved\nby a delivery system that permeates the intestinal barrier, such as mEVs. A\nmodel \u2018housekeeping\u2019 protein, GAPDH, was selected as a target for knock-down\nas it represents a commonly chosen target for these studies, and the GAPDH\nactivity was measured by KDalertTM GAPDH Assay Kit to determine gene silencing\n[28, 29]. The gene silencing efficiency of GAPDH siRNA-loaded mEVs in\nmacrophages is shown in Fig. 4. 0.05 mg/mL GAPDH siRNA loaded-mEVs\n(corresponding to 0.010 nmol/mL loaded siRNA) possessed around 50% silencing\nefficiency (48 h post-transfection), which was significantly higher than siRNA\ntransfected with a commercial transfection reagent (~ 5% silencing efficiency)\nand negative control (siRNA alone).\n\nFig. 4\n\nExpression levels of GAPDH in macrophages transfected with siRNA-loaded milk\nextracellular vesicles (mEVs) or siRNA with a commercial transfection reagent\n(TR), compared with siRNA alone. mEVs concentrations were 0.05 and 0.02 mg/mL\ncorresponding to the siRNA concentration of 0.010 and 0.004 nmol/mL. Data are\npresented as mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3). ** indicates p < 0.01 compared with siRNA + TR\nand siRNA alone group\n\nFull size image\n\n### Efficacy of siRNA-loaded mEVs in a rat model of IBD\n\nThe effect of administration of anti-TNF\u03b1 siRNA-loaded mEVs in a rat model of\nIBD, specifically TNBS-induced ulcerative colitis, is shown in Fig. 5.\nTreatment with anti-TNF\u03b1 siRNA-loaded mEVs demonstrated an effect in the\ndistal colon through the reduction of length of major site of inflammation,\npresented as macroscopic score (Fig. 5A, B and p < 0.05). Moreover, in the\ntreated group a morphological improvement in histological sections was\nencountered, particularly when comparing the proximal sections of the distal\ncolon between groups [Fig. 5D, \u2018mEV-siRNA 2\u2019 versus \u2018Control 2\u2019 or \u2018Vehicle 2\u2019\n(mEVs alone, electroporated but non-drug loaded) vs., p < 0.05], which\ncorresponds to the macroscopic findings. Foci of non-necrotic mucosa were\npresent in the treated group, as shown in Fig. 5b, c, as opposed to non-\ntreated TNBS induced colitis groups, which presented with diffuse mucosal and\nsubmucosal necrosis and severe inflammation and fibrosis (Fig. 5a) (5D,\nControl 1 or Vehicle 1 vs. mEV-siRNA 1). The significant morphological\nimprovement in the proximal segment of the distal colon in the treated group\nsuggests that mEVs successfully delivered functional anti-TNF\u03b1 siRNA cargo, to\nwhich the effect is attributed. Our hypothesis is that anti-TNF\u03b1 siRNA-loaded\nmEVs permeate the intestinal epithelium and influence cytokine production by\nimmune cells, thereby alleviating inflammation and promoting barrier repair\n[30, 31]. Intestinal epithelial transport of siRNA-loaded mEVs was also\nconfirmed in Caco-2 monolayers, whereby we tracked fluorescently labelled\nsiRNA (instead of mEVs) (Additional file 1: Fig. S5), noting that mEV-loaded\nsiRNA outperformed the transport of siRNA alone. It must be noted that in this\nproof-of-concept in vivo study, only a single dosage regimen of anti-TNF\u03b1\nsiRNA-loaded mEVs was tested and future studies should optimise the treatment\ntimeline, together with decreasing the TNBS dose used to induce inflammation\nso to obtain less necrosis, enabling better delineation of morphological\nfindings following treatment. It is also critical to note that successful\nsiRNA response (indicating successful delivery) was observed despite the low\nloading efficiency achieved with electroporation (~ 5%). There is therefore\nsignificant scope to further improve the therapeutic response to siRNA-loaded\nmEVs though dose optimisation and/or improvement of loading efficiency.\n\nFig. 5\n\nIn vivo efficacy of milk extracellular vesicles (mEVs) loaded with anti-tumour\nnecrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) small interfering RNA (siRNA) in a rat model of\nulcerative colitis.

Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD (n =\n3). * Indicates p < 0.05\n\nFull size image\n\n## Conclusions\n\nOverall, our work confirms that mEVs are highly competent at transporting\nacross the human intestinal epithelium and this property is not compromised by\ntheir treatment in intestinal fluids (hence indicating stability).\nImportantly, the work for the first time utilizes human-derived apical-out\nIEOs and IEO monolayers to demonstrate apical-to-basolateral transport of\nmEVs, which demonstrates the potential of mEVs as nanocarriers for intestinal\nepithelial delivery of biotherapeutic cargo, which would otherwise have poor\ndelivery. The efficient induction of gene silencing in macrophages by siRNA\nloaded-mEVs, as well as a clearly efficient ability to permeate the intestinal\nepithelium indicates the therapeutic potential of mEVs. Using inflammatory\nbowel disease (IBD) as an example application, we show that administration of\nanti-TNF\u03b1 siRNA-loaded mEVs reduced inflammation in a rat model of IBD.\nTherefore, mEVs could act as safe systems of natural origin that could enable\noral delivery of nucleic acid therapies, such as RNA, or inform the design of\nsynthetic delivery systems for such application.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Materials\n\nBovine pasteurized skimmed milk was purchased from a local grocery\n(Sainsbury\u2019s).

Briefly, 70 mL of milk was centrifuged at 13,000 \u00d7 g for 30\nmin at 4 oC with Optima XPN-80 Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Type 45 Ti\nfixed angle rotor) to remove fats and casein. The whey was then centrifuged at\n100,000 \u00d7 g for 60 min to pellet large particles. The supernatant was filtered\nby 0.2 \u03bcm filter to remove large particles and further centrifuged at 135,000\n\u00d7 g for 90 min, producing mEVs pellets which were washed with PBS once and\nresuspended in 1 mL sterile PBS. Resuspended mEVs were then purified by SEC\nand resulting 500 \u03bcL of fractions containing mEVs were collected for\ndownstream application. Purified mEVs in sterile PBS could be stored at \u2212 80\noC for up to 3 months. Total protein concentration of mEV samples was\ndetermined by QuantiProTM BCA Assay Kit following the manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions. Size and particle concentration (yield) were determined by NTA\n(Malvern Nanosight LM-10, UK). Surface charge (Zeta-potential) was measured by\nMalvern Zetasizer (Malvern, UK). The expression of exosome protein markers was\ndetermined using Exo-CheckTM Exosome Antibody Array Kit following\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nThe morphological features of mEVs were examined by TEM. Briefly, 300-mesh\ncarbon-coated copper grids were pre-treated by glow discharge (negative\ncharge). 3 \u03bcl of mEVs were applied onto the grids and incubated at room\ntemperature for 1 min, after which were stained with 3% uranyl formate for\nadditional 1 min. Images were acquired on JEM-1400 flash (JEOL, Japan) at an\nacceleration voltage of 80 kV.\n\nTo image and quantify the transport of mEVs across intestinal epithelial\nmodels, mEVs were labelled using an ExoGlowTM-protein EV labeling kit (Red).\nBriefly, 1 \u03bcL of the labelling dye was added to 500 \u03bcL mEVs suspension\n(0.4\u20131.0 mg/mL) and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 20 min with shaking. Thereafter,\n167 \u03bcL ExoQuickTM reagent was added to the mixture and incubated at 4 \u00b0C\novernight to precipitate mEVs. Thereafter, the mixture was centrifuged at\n10,000 \u00d7 rpm for 10 min to remove excess labelling dye and pellet the labelled\nmEVs which were then resuspended in sterile PBS.\n\n### Preparation of liposomes\n\nLiposomes were prepared using the following lipids: 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-\nglycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC); 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine\n(DOPE); 1,2-distearoyl-sn-\nglycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl) (ammonium\nsalt) (NBD-DSPE); and Rhodamine PE (Rho-PE), with the molar ratio of\n67%:30%:1.5%:1.5%. All lipids were dissolved in chloroform and were added to a\nround bottom flask. The organic solvent was evaporated by a rotary evaporator\nto create the lipid film which was dried under vacuum overnight. Thereafter,\nlipid film was hydrated by HEPES buffer (4 mM, pH 7.4) with a final lipid\nconcentration of 1 mg/mL and 10 freeze-thaw cycles (freezing in liquid\nnitrogen and thawing by sonication at 40 \u00b0C for \u223c5 min) applied to develop and\nhomogenize the liposomes.\n\n### Comparison of transport of mEVs and liposomes in intestinal Caco-2\nmonolayers\n\nThe purpose of these studies was to compare intestinal epithelial transport of\nmEVs versus a synthetic lipid nanoparticle system, namely liposomes of similar\nsize (~ 100 nm). A comparison was also made with the free fluorescent dye\nwhich was used to label mEVs. Epithelial transport was determined in\ndifferentiated intestinal Caco-2 monolayers as a commonly used intestinal\nmodel. Caco-2 cells were cultured on Transwell inserts for 21 days, with\nmeasurement of TEER by EVOM (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA)\nto ensure monolayer barrier integrity. Prior to the transport study, the\nculture medium was replaced with HBSS and cells incubated for 45 min at 37 \u00b0C\nand 5% CO_2 atmosphere for equilibration. Thereafter, 500 \u03bcL of labelled mEVs\nat 0.05 mg/mL protein concentration, liposomes at 0.05 mg/mL lipid\nconcentration, and fluorescent dye the concentration of which was adjusted to\nproduce same fluorescent signal as that of mEVs, were added to the apical side\nof monolayers for 120 min. During the incubation, 100 \u03bcL basolateral solution\nwas sampled regularly (at 30 min intervals), with the sampled solution\nreplaced with HBSS. mEVs and labelling dye in the sampled basolateral solution\nwere quantified by fluorescence using plate reader (excitation 565 nm;\nemission 615 nm), and liposomes were quantified by Rhodamine fluorescence with\nexcitation wavelength of 530 nm and emission wavelength of 588 nm.\n\n### Effect of simulated intestinal fluids (SIFs) on mEVs physicochemical\ncharacteristics and transport across Caco-2 monolayers\n\nFaSSIF (pH 6.5) and FeSSIF (pH 5.0) were used as simple, commercially\navailable models of small intestinal fluids. SIFs were prepared according to\nthe manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 100 \u03bcL of mEV suspension at 1 mg/mL protein\nconcentration was incubated in 400 \u03bcL of SSIFs at 37 oC with gentle shaking\nfor 1.5 h. After digestion, mEVs were recovered via centrifugal\nultrafiltration with 100 kDa Amicon Ultra-0.5 Centrifugal Filter Unit (Merck,\nDorset, UK) by four sequential centrifugations for 10 min each at 10,000 \u00d7\nrpm. 500 \u03bcL of PBS was added between each spin to wash off the remaining\ndebris from the digestion solutions. Post treatment with SSIFs, mEVs were\nresuspended in 200 \u03bcL PBS and characterized for size and Zeta-potential.\n\nHarvested mEVs were then labelled with a fluorescence dye to enable\nquantitation of transport. Labelling was achieved using an ExoGlow^TM-protein\nEV labeling kit (Red) as mentioned above. Thereafter, 500 \u03bcL of labelled mEVs\nat 0.05 mg/mL protein concentration that were previously treated with SIFs or\nPBS (control) were added to the apical side of monolayers for 90 min.\nTransport was determined using the same process as mentioned above.\n\n### Culture of 3D apical-out intestinal epithelial organoids (IEOs)\n\nIEOs were a kind gift from Dr Vivian Li (Francis Crick Institute, London, UK).\nThey were generated by Dr Li from tissues collected from a 2-year-old female\npatient with ethical approval (Research Ethics Committee reference\n04/Q0508/79). IEOs were defrosted from liquid nitrogen stock in 37 \u00b0C and then\ncentrifuged at 800 \u00d7 g for 5 min immediately. IEOs pellets were resuspended in\nMatrigel and seeded on pre-warmed 24 wells plate with 50 \u03bcL droplet per well\nand supplemented with 0.5 mL IEOs growth medium: Advanced DMEM/F-12 with 10 mM\nHEPES, 1X GlutaMAXTM, 50% WNT3A conditioned medium (in house production), 20%\nR-Spondin-1 conditioned medium (in house production), 1.25 mM N-Acetyl-L-\ncysteine, 10 mM Nicotinamide, 1X B-27TM Supplement, 150 ng/mL Recombinant\nHuman Noggin, 50 ng/mL Human EGF Recombinant Protein, 10 nM Gastrin I human,\n0.5 \u03bcM A83-01 and 10 \u03bcM SB202190. The growth medium was changed every 2\u20133\ndays. IEOs cultures were passaged every 7\u201310 days, and 10 \u03bcM Y-27,632 was\nadded to the growth medium for the first 2\u20133 days after passage.\n\nApical-out 3D IEOs were generated by non-Matrigel culturing. PET inserts with\n0.4 \u03bcm pore size were used for this purpose. Briefly, IEOs in Matrigel were\nbroken up by pipette tip gently and centrifuged at 800 \u00d7 g for 5 min to remove\nthe medium and most of Matrigel. IEOs pellets were resuspended in TrypLETM\nwith 500 \u03bcL/well and incubated in 37 \u00b0C for 10 min to disassociate IEOs into\nsingle cells. Thereafter, IEOs were centrifuged again to remove TrypLETM and\nthe pellets were resuspended in IEOs growth medium. 70 \u03bcm cells strainer was\nused to filter the suspension and single IEOs cells were collected. To develop\napical-out IEOs, dissociated cells were seeded on 24-well PET inserts with 1.0\n\u00d7 10^5 \u2013 5.0 \u00d7 10^5 cells/well (100 \u03bcL/well) and cultured for 10 days. The\ngrowth medium was changed every 2\u20133 days, and 10 \u03bcM Y-27,632 was added for the\nfirst 2\u20133 days after seeding. To create conventional, basolateral-out IEOs on\nthe same inserts, 25 \u03bcL/well Matrigel was used to coat the surface of inserts.\nAfter incubated the coated-inserts in 37 \u00b0C for 15 min, IEOs single cells were\nseeded and cultured on inserts with same procedures as apical-out IEOs.\n\n### Culture of intestinal epithelial organoid (IEO) monolayers\n\nIEOs were generated from mucosal biopsies (i.e. duodenum, terminal ileum,\nsigmoid colon) obtained from a patient with mild chronic gastritis. Ethical\napproval for the study was obtained (Research Ethics Committee reference\n17/EE/0265). IEOs (\u2018IBD-IEOs\u2019) were cultured as previously reported [34], with\nminor modification. Briefly, IEOs were defrosted from liquid nitrogen stock at\n37 \u00b0C, then immediately added to warm AF+++ medium (Advanced DMEM/F-12 with 10\nmM HEPES, 1X GlutaMAXTM, and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (v/v)). After\ncentrifugation at 800 \u00d7 g for 5 min, IEO pellets were resuspended in Matrigel\nand seeded on pre-warmed 48 wells plate (3548, Corning) with 20 \u03bcL droplet per\nwell and supplemented with 0.25 mL IntestiCultTM Organoid Growth Medium\n(Human) (growth medium). The growth medium was changed every 2\u20133 days. IEOs\ncultures were passaged every 7\u201310 days, and 10 \u03bcM Y-27,632 was added to the\ngrowth medium for the first 2\u20133 days after passage. Following culture for 4\u20135\ndays in growth medium, IEOs were differentiated by differentiation medium for\nanother 3\u20134 days. Differentiation media was prepared by AF+++ medium\nsupplemented with 50 ng/mL Human EGF Recombinant Protein, 100 ng/mL\nRecombinant Human Noggin, 10 nM Gastrin I human, 500 nM A83-01, 10 \u03bcM Y27632,\n5 \u03bcM DAPT, 1 mM N-Acetyl-L-cysteine and 1X B27 [22]. The differentiation\nmedium was changed every 2 days.\n\nIEO monolayers were generated as previously reported, with some modifications\n[35]. Firstly, the 6.5 mm transwells inserts (PET for imaging and\npolycarbonate for transport study) were coated with 40X diluted BME2.\nSpecifically, BME2 was diluted with cold AF+++ medium by 40X and 150 \u03bcL of\ndiluted BME2 was added to each well followed with incubation in 37 \u00b0C for 1\u20132\nh. Diluted BME2 medium mixture was removed from wells before adding the cells.\nOrganoids which were not excessively large were used to generate monolayer\nmodel. Briefly, IEOs in Matrigel were broken up and resuspended in cold AF+++\nmedium. After centrifugation (800 x g, 5 min), organoid pellets were\nresuspended in TrypLETM with 250 \u03bcL/well and incubated in 37 \u00b0C for 10 min to\ndisassociate them into single cells. The suspension was pipetted during the\nincubation to help with the disassociation of organoids. Thereafter, cold\nAF+++ medium was added to the TrypLETM mixture and centrifuged at 800 \u00d7 g for\n5 min. IEO cell pellets were resuspended in cold AF+++ medium and filtered\nwith 70 \u03bcm cells strainer. After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in\ngrowth medium. To develop IEO monolayers, 0.8\u20131.5 \u00d7 10^6 cells/mL were added\nto the apical side of transwell inserts (150 \u03bcL/well) and 600\u2013800 \u03bcL growth\nmedium (depending on plate types) was added basolaterally. Growth medium was\nchanged every 2\u20133 days, and 10 \u03bcM Y-27,632 was added for the first 2\u20133 days\nafter seeding. Differentiation of IEO monolayers was induced as mentioned\nabove. Cell monolayer growth was monitored by measuring TEER.\n\n### Confocal immunofluorescence imaging of apical-out IEOs and IEO monolayer\nmodels\n\nIEOs cultured in Matrigel, 3D apical-out IEOs and IEO monolayers were washed\nwith 0.01 M PBS for 3 time and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at\nroom temperature followed permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X 100 for 5 min.\nThereafter, IEOs were blocked with blocking buffer (5% (w/v) skimmed dry milk\npowder with 0.5% Triton-X 100 in 0.01 M PBS) for 1 h. IEOs were then incubated\nwith primary antibodies (1:150 ZO-1 polyclonal antibody and 1:150 MUC2\nmonoclonal antibody diluted in 1% (w/v) skimmed dry milk powder with 0.5%\nTriton-X 100) at 4 \u00b0C overnight and then incubated with secondary antibodies\n(1:500 goat anti-rabbit Alexa FluorTM 488 lgG and 1:500 goat anti-mouse Alexa\nFluorTM 594 IgG diluted in 1% (w/v) skimmed dry milk powder with 0.05%\nTriton-X 100) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, IEOs were treated with\nFluoreshieldTM DAPI to stain nuclei. To enable imaging, transwell membrane-\nsupported IEOs were cut off and placed on a 24-well plate with polymer\ncoverslip bottom (\u03bc-Plate 24 Well Black ID 14 mm, Ibidi, Gr\u00e4felfing, Germany).\nThen, 0.5% (w/v) low temperature gelling agarose at 30 \u00b0C was added drop-wise\nto cover and immobilize the membrane. IEOs cultured in Matrigel were imaged\ndirectly after immunostaining. Images were collected by the 20 X or 40 X water\nobjective on Opera PhenixTM High Content Screening System (PerkinElmer,\nWaltham, MA, US).\n\n### mEV transport across apical-out IEOs and IEO monolayers\n\nTo evaluate the transport of mEVs through 3D apical-out IEOs, labelled mEVs\nwere diluted in IEOs growth medium to 0.05 mg/mL and applied to 3D apical-out\nIEOs for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO_2 atmosphere. Thereafter, the growth medium\ncontaining mEVs was removed and IEOs immunostained and imaged as described\nabove.\n\nPrior to the study of mEVs transport across IEOs monolayers, the integrity of\nmonolayers was evaluated by determining FD10 permeability. To do this, culture\nmedium was replaced by HBSS and monolayers incubated for 45 min at 37 \u00b0C and\n5% CO_2 atmosphere for equilibration. Thereafter, 150 \u03bcL of 1 mg/mL FD10 in\nHBSS was added to the apical side of monolayers for 160 min. During the\nincubation, 100 \u03bcL basolateral solution was sampled regularly (at 40 min\nintervals), with the sampled solution replaced with HBSS. FD10 was quantified\nby fluorescence at 490 nm/520 nm excitation/emission wavelengths. The\ntransport of labelled mEVs through IEO monolayers was determined in a similar\nmanner, with mEVs quantitation using fluorescence at excitation wavelength of\n565 nm and emission wavelength of 615 nm. For confocal imaging of the IEO\nmonolayers after mEV transport, cells on Transwell filters were processed for\nimmunostaining and confocal imaging as mentioned above.\n\n### siRNA Loading of mEVs\n\nsiRNA was loaded into mEVs by electroporation, which was optimized based on a\nprevious report [36]. Specifically, 150 \u03bcg mEVs were mixed with 0.58 nmol\nsiRNA, followed by the addition of the electroporation buffer (1:1 v/v ratio\nto mEVs-siRNA mixture). The electroporation cuvette was incubated in ice for\n10 min. Electroporation was performed at 400 V/200 \u03bcF on a Gene pulser System\n(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Watford, UK). Unloaded siRNA was removed via ExoQuickTM\nreagent or ultracentrifugation (135,000 \u00d7 g for 90 min). Cyanine 5 fluorescent\nsiRNA was used to calculate the loading efficiency by Eq. (1):\n\n\\% \\,~loading~efficiency = 100~ \\times\n~\\frac{{amount~of~loaded~siRNA}}{{amount~of~added~siRNA}}\n\n(1)\n\n### siRNA transfection\n\nJ774A.1 macrophage cells were seeded on 96-wells plate with 5000 cells/well\nand cultured for 24 h to ~ 50% confluence. GAPDH siRNA loaded-mEVs were\ndiluted to 0.05 and 0.02 mg/mL (corresponding to the siRNA concentration of\n0.010 and 0.004 nmol/mL calculated by the loading efficiency) with Opti-MEMTM\nI Reduced Serum Medium and incubated with cells for 48 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO_2\natmosphere. Thereafter, GAPDH activity was measured by KDalertTM GAPDH Assay\nKit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Negative siRNA loaded-mEVs\nwere applied as negative control group, and GAPDH siRNA transfected with\ncommercial transfection reagent (X-tremeGENETM 360 Transfection Reagent, 2.5\n\u03bcl/mL) was applied as positive control group. The % remaining GAPDH gene\nexpression was calculated with Eq. (2):\n\n\\% ~\\,remaining~expression{\\text{~}} = 100{\\text{~}} \\times\n{\\text{~}}\\frac{{\\Delta \\,fluorescence~of~GAPDH}}{{\\Delta\n\\,fluorescence~of~Negative}}\n\n(2)\n\nWhere \u2206fluorescence of GAPDH and \u2206fluorescence of Negative are fluorescence\nincreases within 4 min for samples and negative control group, respectively.\n\n### In vivo evaluation of siRNA-loaded mEVs\n\nAnimal studies were carried out under the University guidelines for the care\nof experimental animals and were approved by Research and Ethics Committee of\nthe Faculty of Medicine at the University of Prishtina, Kosovo. Male Wistar\nrats weighing 380\u2013420 g were used in this study. Rats were housed per each\ngroup in a Digital Ventilated Cages (DVC\u00ae, Tecniplast, Italy) under 20\u201322 \u00b0C\nand had a 12:12-h photoperiod with an access to standard laboratory chow and\nwater ad libitum. The induction of colitis model was performed by\n4,6-trinitrobenzene-sulfonic acid (TNBS, Sigma-Aldrich) based on a previous\nstudy [37]. To this end, TNBS was dissolved in 50% ethanol to a concentration\n30 mg/ml. Rats were fasted 24 h and 40 mg/kg of TNBS were administered\nintrarectally 8 cm proximal to the anus (total volume of 500\u2013560 \u03bcL) by a\nlubricated silicone catheter. For TNBS administration, rats were anesthetized\nwith Ketamine-xylazine cocktail (day 0). Animals were maintained in a head\nside down situation for 1 min to prevent any leakage of solution. Rats were\ntreated with anti-TNF\u03b1 siRNA-loaded mEVs (\u2018mEV-siRNA\u2019), unloaded mEVs, which\nwere electroporated using the same conditions as siRNA loaded mEVs\n(\u2018vehicle\u2019), or PBS (\u2018control\u2019), starting 24 h after TNBS administration for\nfour days (single oral gavage dosage of 200 \u03bcL, day 1\u20134). siRNA loaded and\nunloaded mEVs were administered in PBS and the same volumes were administered\nin all groups. On day 6 of experiment rats were euthanized with asphyxiation\nin CO_2 and the colon was dissected carefully for further macroscopic and\nmicroscopic evaluation.\n\nThe severity of macroscopic changes was evaluated by an independent observer\nwho was blinded to the treatment. For each animal, the distal 10 cm portion of\nthe colon was cut perpendiculary and slightly cleaned in PBS to remove faecal\nresidues. Scores were assigned based on clinical features of the colon as per\nprevious recommendations adapted to our findings (score 0\u20135: 0 (no damage), 1\n(hyperaemia without ulceration), 2 (hyperemia with ulceration up to \u02c2 4 cm\nalong the colon), 3 (major sites of inflammation \u2265 4 cm to \u02c2 5 cm along the\ncolon), 4 (major sites of inflammation \u2265 5 cm to \u02c2 6 cm, 5 (major sites of\ninflammation \u2265 6 cm) [38]. For histological changes, two perpendicular\nsections were taken from the distal 10 cm portion of the distal colon of each\nanimal. One section from the zone with the most extensive macroscopic changes\nand one section from the most proximal zone of macroscopic changes in the\ndistal colon. Tissue samples were fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde,\ndehydrated in grade ethanol, embedded in paraffin and cut into 5 mm sections\nusing a rotary microtome. Thereafter, sections were mounted on clean glass\nslides and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E). All tissue sections were\nexamined with light microscopy for characterization of histopathological\nfeatures by an experienced pathologist. The histopathological features were\nsemiquantitatively scored as per previous recommendations adapted to our\nfindings (score 0\u201312, 0- (normal), 1\u20134 (light microscopic changes), 5\u20139\n(moderate histological changes), 10\u201312 (extensive histological changes)) for\nthe presence of transmucosal and submucosal necrosis and ulceration extending\nthrough the muscularis mucosae (Grade: 0\u2014no presence; 1\u2014focal necrosis or\nulceration; 2\u2014diffuse necrosis with foci of non-necrotic mucosa with or\nwithout ulceration; 3\u2014diffuse necrosis with or without ulceration); oedema and\ntransmural inflammatory cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes,\nlymphocytes, and eosinophils; muscularis externa thickness and serosal\nfibrosis (Grade: 0\u2014normal, 1\u2014light, 2\u2014moderate, 3\u2014extensive) [38, 39].\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nData were analyzed using GraphPad Prism\u00ae.
