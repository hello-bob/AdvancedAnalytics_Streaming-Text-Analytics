Although high refractive index polymers\n(HRIPs) are essential for manufacturing modern optoelectronic devices,\nincluding displays and light sensors, they are expensive and environmentally\nunfriendly. Now, the academics have developed a new family of HRIPs called\npoly(thiourea)s.\n\nIn their article published in Advanced Functional Materials on April 12, 2024,\nthe researchers say its properties make it a perfect candidate for modern\noptoelectronic applications. Overall, the results are highly promising for the\nfuture of optoelectronic materials and devices in the greater context of\nsustainability, they claim.\n\n\u201cBased on these findings, environmentally friendly optical materials would be\neasily preparable with a simple process, enabling sustainable optoelectronics\nsuch as low-cost bright displays, wearable lighting devices, and thinner,\nlighter, and degradable polymer eyeglasses,\u201d said project leader Professor\nKenichi Oyaizu, department of applied chemistry, Waseda University.\n\n\u201cI believe this is the first step toward the comprehensive design of next-\ngeneration optoelectronic polymers that can provide high light-extraction\nefficiency without harming the environment.\u201d\n\nThanks to unique intermolecular interactions, the researchers\u2019 compounds can\nbe easily processed into low-cost transparent HRIPs for optoelectronic\napplications, as well as degraded and recycled through an inexpensive\nprotocol, making them a sustainable option.\n\nOptoelectronic devices have found their way into many aspects of our daily\nlives, from OLED displays to photodetectors, security systems, and\nenvironmental monitoring. In all the applications, these devices utilise high\nrefractive index polymers (HRIPs) to control light.\n\nIn general, the optical properties of transparent HRIPs enable efficient light\ntransmission and manipulation, allowing optoelectronics devices to guide and\ncontrol the flow of light to improve their performance. But there are no low-\ncost options for HRIPs that can guarantee good optical performance while being\ntransparent and environmentally friendly. This is because, for most materials,\nthere exists an inherent trade-off between their refractive index,\ntransparency, and processability.\n\nThis article was co-authored by Seigo Watanabe, from the Research Institute of\nScience and Engineering, Waseda University, as well as Luca M. Cavinato and\nRub\u00e9n D. Costa, both from the Chair of Biogenic Functional Materials,\nTechnical University of Munich, Germany.\n\nThe proposed family of compounds are called poly(thiourea)s (PTUs), with each\nrepeating unit of the polymer (the monomer) comprising a simple aromatic ring\nlinked to a thiourea group (H_2N\u2212C(=S)\u2212NH_2). These PTUs have an exceptional\nproperty: the thiourea units in different polymer strands attract each other\nvia hydrogen bonds, which is a type of intermolecular interaction. Simply put,\nthe sulfur (S) atoms of a thiourea group attract the hydrogen (H) atoms linked\nto nitrogen (N) in another thiourea group due to local differences in electric\ncharge.\n\nThese so-called \u2018polarisable hydrogen bonds\u2019 cause the PTU material to be\ndensely packed, creating dense networks. Since the polymer is amorphous and\nhas no crystalline order, it is highly transparent.\n\nMeanwhile, the aromatic rings serve as spacers, providing some rigidity and\nmechanical strength and contributing to a higher refractive index. The\nresearch team carefully analysed the properties of these PTUs and demonstrated\ntheir potential by incorporating them into experimental optoelectronic\ncomponents, obtaining remarkable results. More specifically, the proposed PTUs\ndemonstrated a high transparency of over 92% and an exceptional refractive\nindex of 1.81.\n\nNotably, the team also investigated whether PTUs could be easily degraded into\nsimpler useful molecules. \u201cDue to recent environmental issues caused by\nplastic wastes, the degradation of polymers to monomers becomes an essential\nfunctionality leading to sustainable recycling. To the best of our knowledge,\nthere have been extremely few attempts to impart degradability to HRIPs, and\nsystematic designs for degradable HRIPs have not been reported despite such\nglobal needs,\u201d said Professor Oyaizu.\n\nTheir efforts led to a simple degradation protocol that involves mild heating\nconditions and mixing with diamines, which is enough to break up PTUs into\nsmaller pieces that can be reprocessed or repurposed for the chemical\nsynthesis of new PTUs.\n\nTitle of original paper: Polarisable H-bond Concept in Aromatic\nPoly(thiourea)s: Unprecedented High Refractive Index, Transmittance, and\nDegradability at Force to Enhance Lighting Efficiency.
