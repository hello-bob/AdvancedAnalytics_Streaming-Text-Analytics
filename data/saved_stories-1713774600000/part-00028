The Swiss crew rejected takeoff at low speed (about 40 knots over ground)\nadvising ATC they had rejected their takeoff because of traffic on the runway.\nATC acknowledged, queried the crew whether they wanted to return to the\ndeparture point and instructed the aircraft to vacate the runway and taxi to\nthe holding point. The aircraft departed about 15 minutes after the rejected\ntakeoff.The three aircraft crossing runway 04L, Delta Airlines Boeing 767-400\nregistration N838MH performing flight DL-29 from Nice (France), Delta Airlines\nBombardier C-Series CS-300 registration N104DU performing flight DL-420 from\nDallas Ft. Worth,TX (USA) and American Airlines Boing 737-8 MAX registration\nN342RX performing flight AA-2246 from Dallas Ft. Worth, had landed on runway\n04R and had been cleared to cross runway 04L by the tower controller 04R about\n40 seconds prior to LX-17 receiving their takeoff clearance.According to ADS-B\nData DL-420 was still on the eastern parallel taxiway to 04L when LX-17 began\nand rejected their takeoff, DL-29 was just reaching the western edge of the\nrunway when LX-17 rejected takeoff and AA-2246 was just crossing the runway\ncenter line when LX-17 rejected takeoff.On both tower frequencies there were\nno instructions to stop, cancel the crossing clearance or abort takeoff. Both\ncontrollers continued duties.Map at the moment LX-17 rejected takeoff\n(Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):  \n---  \n  \nReader Comments: (the comments posted below do not reflect the view of The\nAviation Herald but represent the view of the various posters)\n\nBy (anonymous) on Sunday, Apr 21st 2024 21:30Z\n\nLack of coordination between controllers or loss of situation awareness?\n\nX-ing clnc for runway not under control? By Pollex on Sunday, Apr 21st 2024\n19:26Z\n\nRWY 04R\u2019s ATCO issued a crossing clearance for RWY 04L, despite he was not\ncontrolling this RWY? Did he get the permission of 04L\u2018s ATCO to relay that?\n\nBy (anonymous) on Sunday, Apr 21st 2024 19:07Z\n\nJFK ATC really wanted to see dead people that day. Clearing not one, two or\nthree, but four aircrafts to cross the active runway. And then continuing as\nif nothing had happened.\n\nFAA needs to increase staffing at JFK, fatigue is setting in By (anonymous) on\nSunday, Apr 21st 2024 18:33Z\n\nYeah, JFK again, where good controllers are sent to work too many hours with\ntoo much workload. It's shocking they don't call a strike because they can't\nsafely do their job. Rush, rush, rush! Let the airline CEOs go beat up the\ncongressisonal representatives to whom they give millions of dollars every\nelection year and demand that they fund more controllers.\n\nJFK again .... By When will this change on Sunday, Apr 21st 2024 17:53Z\n\nIls a matter of time before we have a major accident in JFK.\n\nOverconfident and patronizing ATC in JFK is an everyday burden for the crews\noperating on this airport .\n\nNumerous severe incidents without any reconsideration of their working methods\n, the controllers stayed on duty : this is absolutely unprofessional.\n\nBy (anonymous) on Sunday, Apr 21st 2024 17:04Z\n\nAny investigation by FAA or will sweep this under the rug?\n\nNo number to call? By Airspeed on Sunday, Apr 21st 2024 16:27Z\n\nSo I assume that the JFK TWR would have given a number to call to tower.\nSorry, not professional ATC.\n\nBy (anonymous) on Sunday, Apr 21st 2024 15:52Z\n\nNot commenting on cocky, overtasked atc or pilots for that matter. Is it\npossible that there is just too much traffic to be managed safely?\n\nCondescending US ATC By Michael on Sunday, Apr 21st 2024 14:57Z\n\nThere is so many things to improve regarding US ATC.\n\n\\- to come off one's high horse - learn to use standard phraseology -\nunderstand that not every pilot is a native English speaker - not being rude\nand ignorant\n\nThe list could go on forever. It's only a matter of time before things really\nstart to happen.\n\n4 planes By Peter Fryll on Sunday, Apr 21st 2024 14:53Z\n\nIf i'm not not mistaken, a Delta Connection Embraer E175LR flight RPA5752\n(Brickyard 5752) was also cleared to cross.\n\nDouble Standards !! By Aprilia RSV 1000R on Sunday, Apr 21st 2024 14:28Z\n\nIf the following is true : \"Both controllers continued duties\" that is amazing\n! ...from another planet...!\n\nSeriously now ?\n\nIf a crew have done the same...JFK ATC would have eaten them alive !\n\n\"Double standards\" ! A major error will go unnoticed... exactly what is going\nin with US police !\n\nThey enjoy their \"Title\" only... but when the time comes to admit an error /\nto assume responsibilty...they will find 1000 excuses and will hide behind\ntheir mother's skirt !\n\nImagine what could have happened in a reduced VIS TO as Kyrlas said !\n\nJFK culture By SE on Sunday, Apr 21st 2024 13:32Z\n\nInstead of being rude and yelling at pilots these guys should really fix their\nown problems. Happens way too often there.\n\nOnce again By Kyrlas on Sunday, Apr 21st 2024 13:15Z\n\nThis is way too common at JFK. There needs to be a big investigation by the\nFAA into the procedures, working hours, rules, and safety culture. It's only a\nmatter of time till something serious will happen. If the weather had been bad\nthis could have been one of the worst accidents.\n\nSomething needs to happen now and not once it's too late\n\nCrowded Runway By (anonymous) on Sunday, Apr 21st 2024 12:22Z\n\nAny word if the FAA is going to investigate this incident? We need more than\nan increase of 1 hour rest time for ATC to resolve these types of issues.\n\nBy (anonymous) on Sunday, Apr 21st 2024 11:53Z\n\nFlappy you are 100% right.\n\nATC again By Flappy on Sunday, Apr 21st 2024 11:34Z\n\nThis is happening way too often now at JFK. Something needs to be done before\nit\u2019s too late. The ATC at JFK need to be taken down a peg or two, and\nconcentrate on their jobs rather than getting cocky with the pilots.\n\nThe Aviation Herald Apps Android and iOSSupport The Aviation\nHeraldEuroUS$Interview:The human factor named \"Simon Hradecky\" and the team of\nman and machine  \n  \nGet the news right onto your desktop when they happen  \n---  \n  \n\u00a9 2008-2024 by The Aviation Herald, all rights reserved, reprint and\nrepublishing prohibited.
