The release at this point goes beyond the \u201cproof of concept\u201d level,\nand technically is a Jailbreak. What\u2019s missing from a user perspective, is for\n\u201cCustom Firmwares\u201d such as Mira and GoldHEN to be adapted to the new\nFirmwares, which is most likely a matter of days.\n\nIn other words, PS4 Jailbreak for firmware 11.00 is here, rejoice!\n\n## What is PPPwn for PS4 11.00?\n\nPPPwn is a Jailbreak chain for the PS4 released by TheFloW. It relies on a\nsurprisingly old public vulnerability in one of the FreeBSD Network drivers\n(sppp). The vulnerability was apparently never patched for PS4, or incorrectly\nbrought back at some point. Details on how the vulnerability impacts the PS4\nin particular can be found on hackerone.\n\nNotably, PPPwn is a remote control execution attack, meaning that someone\nwithout physical access to the console could technically trigger the exploit\nby setting up a \u201cmalicious\u201d PPPoE endpoint. (They\u2019d still need the target PS4\nto actually connect to it though).\n\nPPPwn is confirmed to work up to Firmware 11.00, with existing implementations\nfor Firmware 9.0 and 11.00 (and probably more to come).\n\nIn its current implementation, PPPwn simply displays a confirmation message\nonce the exploit gets root access. More \u201cuser friendly\u201d payloads will need to\nbe adapted to the exploit and to Firmware 11.00, in particular Custom\nFirmwares such as GoldHEN or Mira. I expect such ports will take a few days,\npossibly a few weeks (but sometimes with these things, the scene can be\nsurprisingly fast).\n\n> Decided to publish PPPwn early. The first PlayStation 4 Kernel RCE.\n> Supporting FWs upto 11.00.https://t.co/INayQSp8fL pic.twitter.com/xhj2jepsY7\n>\n> \u2014 Andy Nguyen (@theflow0) April 30, 2024\n\n## I am on firmware 11.50/11.02 \u2013 What can I do?\n\nThe short answer is that if you\u2019re on a firmware above 11.00, then PPPwn isn\u2019t\nfor you, and you\u2019ll most likely have to wait for another Jailbreak (which\ncould be years down the road)\n\nWith that being said, If you are on a firmware above 11.00, in particular if\nyou are on firmware 11.02, there might be a chance for you to go back to\nFirmware 11.00. The PS4 holds one \u201cbackup\u201d copy of your previous firmware in\ncase an update goes poorly, and it is possible, with a lot of soldering\neffort, to \u201crevert\u201d your console to that firmware\u2019s backup. Modded Warfare has\nthe most comprehensive video tutorial on the topic, and I\u2019ve covered his video\nhere. If you\u2019re up to the task, that is your only solution (please note that\nin my opinion this is the point where you should seriously consider buying a\nsecondary PS4 at this point, one that\u2019s hackable, unless you\u2019re in this for\nthe PS4 downgrade learning experience).\n\nKeep in mind that the technique will only let you go back to the Firmware that\nwas previously installed on your console. If you went directly from 11.00 to\n11.50, good for you. But if you went from 11.00 to 11.02, then to 11.50, this\nwill only let you go back to 11.02 and is not useful in the context of PPPwn.\n\n## I am on Firmware 9.xx / 10.xx \u2013 Should I upgrade?\n\nIf you are on a lower firmware than 11.00 (and assuming you\u2019re not on 9.00 or\nbelow, since those were already Jailbroken a while ago), my advice for now is\nto stay on your firmware, at least until something \u201cuseful\u201d is released from a\nuser\u2019s perspective. If/when goldHEN and/or Mira get released for Firmware\n11.00, that will be the right time to upgrade. For now, I\u2019d suggest to stay\nput and enjoy the show.\n\n## I have Firmware 11.00 \u2013 How do I download and run PPPwn on my PS4?\n\nYou have to follow the Readme on the project\u2019s official repository at:\nhttps://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/PPPwn. I replicate it below for\nconvenience:\n\nRequirements\n\n  * Computer with Ethernet port\n\n    * USB adapter also works\n  * Ethernet cable\n  * Linux\n\n    * You can use VirtualBox to create a Linux VM with Bridged Adapter as network adapter to use the ethernet port in the VM.\n  * Python3 and gcc installed\n\nUsage\n\nOn your computer, clone the repository:\n\n    \n    \n    git clone --recursive https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/PPPwn\n\nInstall the requirements:\n\n    \n    \n    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nCompile the payloads:\n\n    \n    \n    make -C stage1 FW=1100 clean && make -C stage1 FW=1100 make -C stage2 FW=1100 clean && make -C stage2 FW=1100\n\nFor other firmwares, e.g. FW 9.00, pass FW=900.\n\nRun the exploit (see ifconfig for the correct interface):\n\n    \n    \n    sudo python3 pppwn.py --interface=enp0s3 --fw=1100\n\nFor other firmwares, e.g. FW 9.00, pass --fw=900.\n\nOn your PS4:\n\n  * Go to Settings and then Network\n  * Select Set Up Internet connection and choose Use a LAN Cable\n  * Choose Custom setup and choose PPPoE for IP Address Settings\n  * Enter anything for PPPoE User ID and PPPoE Pasword\n  * Choose Automatic for DNS Settings and MTU Settings\n  * Choose Do Not Use for Proxy Server\n  * Click Test Internet Connection to communicate with your computer\n\nIf the exploit fails or the PS4 crashes, you can skip the internet setup and\nsimply click on Test Internet Connection. If the pppwn.py script is stuck\nwaiting for a request/response, abort it and run it again on your computer,\nand then click on Test Internet Connection on your PS4.\n\nIf the exploit works, you should see an output similar to below, and you\nshould see Cannot connect to network. followed by PPPwned printed on your PS4.\n\nAs often, Modded Warfare has a great video showing the steps in detail:\n\n## Troubleshooting PPPwn\n\nError Leak is invalid \u2013> it is likely you\u2019re running the exploit on the wrong\nfirmware\n\nSource: TheFloW\n\n#### Ports to other Firmwares, Windows support, Kernel dumper... Things are\nmoving fast for the PPPwn exploit\n\nYesterday, PlayStation hacker TheFloW released a Jailbreak for PS4 Firmware\n11.00. The scene are already at work to port existing tools from older\nfirmwares into this new exploit, as well as making the exploit compatible with\nmore options for users. Here's a roundup of what's been happening. Other\nFirmwares support...\n\nMay 2, 2024\n\n#### PS4: PPPwn officially ported to Firmwares 9.03, 9.04, 9.50, 9.60, 10.00,\n10.01, 10.50, 10.70, 10.71. Payload Loader & GoldHEN work in progress\n\nA lot of scene members have contributed to digging and implementing the\noffsets required for PPPwn, to run them on various firmwares. As of today, all\ncompatible firmwares from 9.00 up to 11.00 included are now supported by the\nlatest PS4 Jailbreak. Specifically, PPPwn is now compatible with 9.00,\n9.03,...\n\nMay 3, 2024\n\n#### PPPwn Kernel exploit: What about the PS5?\n\nToday, hacker TheFloW released a Jailbreak chain for PS4 11.00. Named PPPwn,\nthe exploit works on PS4 systems up to firmware 11.00 included. The underlying\nvulnerability also impacts PS5 up to Firmware 8.20 included, so why didn't we\nsee a similar release for the PS5 today?

Hopefully that is the case so that we all migrate to it and the need\nfor backports would stop\n\nI do wonder though, we can do this with a cached page like the previous\nexploits right? We don\u2019t need to do everything manually everytime right?\n\nReply\n\n         * wololo says:\n\nMay 2, 2024 at 7:35 am\n\nPretty sure you\u2019d have to do it every time, I don\u2019t see how caching helps in\nany way here (this exploit does not involve the browser). However I assume\neasier solutions will be implemented eventually. Theoretically, it should be\npossible for the whole thing to be automatic when you boot the PS4: as soon as\nthe PS4 attempts to connect to the internet, it would trigger the exploit\n\nReply\n\n           * ano says:\n\nMay 2, 2024 at 8:13 am\n\nIf they could make it automatic that would be great for sure! Let us hope that\nhappens :).\n\n  4. Yuu says:\n\nMay 1, 2024 at 1:10 pm\n\nThanks to TheFlow now My Ps4 Live again\n\nReply\n\n  5.
