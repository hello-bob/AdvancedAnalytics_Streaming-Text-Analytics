Market leaders chuckle at the sophistication level of\nthese new players, comfortably resting on their technologically superior\nlaurels. Nobody makes money in China, they figure, so there\u2019s probably not\nmuch to worry about\u2014although, some of the designs do look suspiciously close\nto technology that had been firmly shielded by patents and as trade\nsecrets...or so they thought.\n\nShow and steal | Axton Global\n\nLured by the prospect of filling factories and beating Wall Street\nexpectations, more Western suppliers get in on the action, competing to win\norders in the world\u2019s ultimate growth market. As a condition of securing\nChinese business, joint ventures with state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are set\nup, technology is shared, and factories are built locally. Within months,\nvirtually all industry leaders conform to the rules of the game. Wall Street\ndemands growth above all else, and the fear of missing out is strong.\n\nSuddenly, yet another unheard-of company is launched out of China, but this\none is shockingly different. This SOE combines the best of the incumbent\ntechnology, and its products are demonstrably superior to what the West can\noffer. This phenom company begins rolling up market share in China, forcing\ninternational competitors to scramble. Then the exports begin. The value\nproposition on offer is hard to believe: the products are excellent, the price\nis a fraction of what was previously thought to be impossibly cheap, and\nsupply appears to be practically infinite. Unable to compete and with precious\nlittle domestic support, waves of Western companies go out of business. In a\nflash, the CCP now monopolizes the industry.\n\nNo matter how many times the same pattern plays out, the West always seems\nblind to the game China is playing, with one recent exception: semiconductors.\nChina is making the development of a domestic semiconductor supply chain a\nmatter of urgent national importance. The US and its allies are running in the\nsame race while doing everything in their power to prevent China from\nsucceeding. Much ink has been spilled on the geopolitical tensions rising from\nthese efforts.\n\nThe US might be \u201cearly to worry\u201d in this instance, but will they succeed in\npreventing China from becoming the global leader in this technology? Count us\namong the doubtful. Let\u2019s explore why.\n\n## This post is for paid subscribers\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
