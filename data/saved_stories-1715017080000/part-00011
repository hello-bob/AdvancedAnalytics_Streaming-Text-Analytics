Alongside its strong first-quarter earnings\nreport, the company announced its first ever shareholder dividend, as well as\na $70 billion stock buyback. It is now a $2 trillion-dollar company \u2014 worth\nmore at the moment than Amazon, Meta, and Saudi Aramco.\n\nIt\u2019s a gigantic firm with a core product that dominates its sector. Google won\nsearch more than a decade ago, and its parent company has been reaping the\nbenefits ever since. Rather suddenly, though, Google is facing threats \u2014 real,\nmounting, and still mostly unrealized \u2014 that could set it, and its parent\ncompany, on a different trajectory, and soon. One comes from the government.\nThe other comes from competitors. And the last one comes from itself.\n\n## A Monopoly at Risk\n\nLast week, Department of Justice lawyers made their closing arguments in one\nof two active antitrust cases against the company. This one, which has focused\non the dominance of Google Search, zeroed in on a particular arrangement, the\ndetails of which were long kept secret, per Bloomberg:\n\n> Alphabet Inc. paid Apple Inc. $20 billion in 2022 for Google to be the\n> default search engine in the Safari browser, according to newly unsealed\n> court documents in the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust lawsuit against\n> Google. The deal between the two tech giants is at the heart of the landmark\n> case, in which antitrust enforcers allege Google has illegally monopolized\n> the market for online search and related advertising. The Justice Department\n> and Google will offer closing arguments in the case Thursday and Friday,\n> with a decision expected later this year.\n\nThe primary goal of this arrangement has already been achieved. Android, the\nmost widely used smartphone OS in the world, is a Google product, and iOS\nfeeds users into Google by default. By holding onto iPhone users as\nsmartphones became ubiquitous, Google managed to become the default portal to\nthe web for a large majority of smartphone owners. What it\u2019s paying for now is\nmaintenance, which Google clearly believes to be valuable. The judge\noverseeing the case has signaled that Google\u2019s defense sounds sort of weak.\nFrom the Verge:\n\n> [Apple lawyer] Schmidtlein said Apple had evaluated Bing\u2019s quality against\n> Google\u2019s and ultimately chose Google. But why then, asked [Judge] Mehta,\n> sign such an expensive agreement with Apple? Schmidtlein said that Apple\u2019s\n> ability to leave the agreement every time it expires is \u201csufficient to keep\n> Google on its toes and keep Google competing.\u201d\n\nAn order preventing Google from paying Apple wouldn\u2019t necessarily prevent\nother, smaller firms from entering into similar revenue-sharing schemes,\nalthough it might chill such arrangements for firms that are otherwise\nparanoid about antitrust action. At best, for Google, this would mean losing\nan insurance policy on its search dominance \u2014 again, something that the\ncompany believes is worth massive amounts of money, and which it is vigorously\ndefending in court. It could also crack open the door for competitors, of\nwhich there are, rather suddenly, and for the first time in a while, quite a\nfew.\n\n## The AI Search Dilemma\n\nGoogle is still figuring out how to incorporate AI-generated content into its\nsearch results, primarily in the form of Search Generative Answers, which\ndrops short, cited responses at the top of search pages. It\u2019s been in semi-\npublic testing for a year and recently started rolling out to users who didn\u2019t\nsign up to test it.\n\nIt\u2019s getting better as a product, although I\u2019ve noticed in myself a growing\ntendency to skim and scroll past it. It\u2019s more impressive as a demonstration\nthan an actual tool, at least in my experience. By the standards of generative\nAI tools, it\u2019s fairly cautious and, in recent months, has displayed linked\ncitations prominently. It has become, in other words, something like a search\npage within a search page \u2014 similar links, presented and excerpted, or rather\nparaphrased, in a slightly different format.\n\nIt\u2019s also converging a bit with projects like Perplexity that brand themselves\nas AI-powered alternatives to search and are likewise trying to figure out\nwhat, exactly, it means to fuse technology that generates approximations of\nthe truth with tools at least nominally intended to help you retrieve solid\ninformation. The general trend in AI search, such as it is, is toward, well,\nsearch \u2014 away from verbose generated chatbot answers and toward conspicuous\ncitation and summary. ChatGPT in 2024 is much more obviously connected to the\noutside web, and to outside data sources, than when most users tried it for\nthe first time. Other chatbot products are starting to feel more like search\nengines, too: When Meta rolled out AI features on Facebook and Instagram, it\nput them in the search bar. Using them is a bit like chatting, but a lot like\nsearching \u2014 in Meta\u2019s case, blurring things even further, the chatbot will\nsummarize and cite results from Google and Bing. Google can expect a lot more\nof this: In attempts to build a wide range of products, AI start-ups (and\nlarger tech firms) are suddenly doing an awful lot of web crawling. In the\ncourse of doing other business, in other words, they\u2019re acquiring many of the\nvaluable resources necessary to build something like a search engine.\n\nAs for whether this suggests a whole new relationship with the internet or a\nlengthy detour to the same destination, we\u2019ll see. For Google, the more\npressing matter is that none of these new search concepts have much, or any,\nadvertising. Competing chatbots, and search engines like Perplexity, have\nmostly monetized with subscriptions. Meta\u2019s AI responses are very much like\nsearch results but contain no ads. Google\u2019s cautious approach to SGE might be\nexplained by this tension: It\u2019s building an alternative style of \u201csearch\u201d\n\u201cresult\u201d that \u2014 should it catch on, and should users find it better \u2014 has no\nobvious place to the level of advertising that Google displays in its current\nsearch pages, which is the productive open-pit mine at the center of its $2\ntrillion-dollar operation.\n\nThis might be a manageable problem for a company whose search dominance is\nexceptionally well protected, and which has time to experiment. It\u2019s more\nworrying for a company in a protracted battle with the government \u2014 or whose\ncore product is starting to show its age.\n\n## Search Is a Nightmare Now\n\nWhether or not Google Search itself is a worse product than it used to be is\nan open and complicated question, to which the company itself says no,\nactually, it\u2019s better. Taking a long view of the products, it\u2019s certainly much\nbusier than it was when it was a minimalist upstart \u2014 there are ads, widgets,\ntabs, sidebars, snippets, and now clumps of synthetic text. Questions about\noverall search quality are difficult to define, much less rigorously test,\nperhaps to Google\u2019s benefit \u2014 that\u2019s one of the many perks of building a\ncompany around a black-box algorithm.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s easier to observe is that the web on which Google depends \u2014\nand which depends in various ways on Google \u2014 is in pretty bad shape. Websites\nproducing reliable, human content for Google to turn into desirable results\nare running out of ways to make money. Closed platforms have absorbed much of\nthe person-to-person written communication that Google was previously able to\nharvest and serve. AI companies are scraping the web, and their users are\npumping garbage back into it. Is Google somewhat responsible for destroying\nthe business model of other much smaller businesses? Maybe. Did its dominance\nestablish a set of business incentives that centralized and distorted the\nsprawling web? Could be! However it happened, it\u2019s also a problem for Google,\nnow, as its search engine tries to produce results from ever-larger amounts of\never-worse material. Google\u2019s longtime dominance means that much of the web\nsees it as an entity to be gamed, manipulated, appeased, or tricked. It\u2019s a\nfrequently toxic dynamic, and its effects are accumulating.\n\nThis creates a different challenge for Google, unique to its status as an\nincumbent leader: Its competitors no longer have to be great to sometimes feel\nbetter, or at least comparable, to Google. Maybe they just have fewer ads.\nMaybe they\u2019re just more convenient, right there in the chat box. It\u2019s an\nenvironment in which iPhone users, if asked to actually choose a default\nsearch engine from a list, might actually take a look at something else and\nstick with it for a while.\n\n### Sign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter\n\nDaily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of\nService apply.\n\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to\nreceive email correspondence from us.\n\n### Tags:\n\n  * screen time\n  * google\n  * search engines\n  * big tech\n  * technology\n  * artificial intelligence\n  * More\n\nShow 2 Comments / 2 New Leave a Comment\n\nGoogle Is Staring Down Its First Serious Threats in Years\n\nThings you buy through our links may earn Vox Media a commission.\n\n### Most Viewed Stories\n\n  1.
