And since there are people reading this whose eyebrows\nwent up at the \u201ctwo cables\u201d, I thought I\u2019d use this as an occasion to write\nabout my desk and computer setup a little bit.\n\nHere\u2019s a photo. Feel free to print it out and keep as a reference as you read\non.\n\nLet\u2019s do this bottoms-up.\n\nChair: I\u2019ve had this Steelcase Gesture for six years now and highly recommend\nit. I know, I know, these chairs are expensive and the IKEA Markus chair is\nalso pretty comfortable, but believe me when I say the same thing that\neveryone else also says: investing in a good chair really pays off.\n\nAs for Aeron vs. Gesture: I don\u2019t like the Aeron. I think it\u2019s a \u201cworld\npopulation is split 50/50 on this\u201d kind of thing. Try both, chose one.\n\nAlso worth noting: in the past few months I thought the chair would\u2019ve given\nup on me, but turns out it was my butt, not the chair \u2014 somehow something\nhappened in a workout that made it uncomfortable to sit on this chair for more\nthan two hours. Changed workout program and chair\u2019s comfortable again.\nMeaning: investment still pays off!\n\nIf you came here to read about cables and are now wondering how we ended up\ntalking about my butt: sorry but not really! Wait until we get to the desk\nmat.\n\nDesk: also a Steelcase, the height-adjustable Steelcase Ology. Bought it at\nthe same time as the chair and have to admit that I very rarely put it up and\nuse it in standing position. When I went through the whole working-out-made-\nmy-butt-hurt ordeal (see previous section), I used it a lot, but now that\neverything\u2019s fine again down under, I enjoy sitting in very unergonomic\npositions.\n\nBig plus of the desk: the cable tray. Everything\u2019s stuffed in there, including\na very large power strip, power adapters and multiple chargers.\n\nDesk mat: Always wanted a desk mat. Don\u2019t know why. Seemed comfortable. Then,\nlast year, when it got so hot in summer that I\u2019d sweat just sitting here, with\nmy forearms sticking to the desk (see? told you), I thought that a mat could\nsolve this.\n\nFirst I ordered a mat made out of felt. Bad move. Felt feels horrible when you\nconstantly move your arms on it. Then, thinking that I could get rid of the\nmouse pad at the same time, I ordered a gaming desk mat, from Razer. It\u2019s\ncalled: Razer Pro Glide XXL. What a name. But it\u2019s good! And even though it\u2019s\nin light grey, it doesn\u2019t look that disgusting yet, even six months later.\n\nAudio interface: this is a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 and I\u2019ve had it for years\ntoo. No complaints about it, does what it\u2019s supposed to and even works under\nLinux nowadays without a lot of fiddling.\n\nFew months back I mounted it under the desk. Pro: less stuff on the desk \u2014\nless cables, less audio interfaces. Con: not that comfortable anymore to\nchange volume or turn it on/off.\n\nLast point is a bit of a pain in the butt (like the chair was, yes): whenever\nI switch computers, I have to turn the audio interface on again, which means\nI\u2019m in a lot of calls in which people say \u201cthorsten? can you hear me?\u201d because\nthey didn\u2019t hear my \u201chello\u201d because I forgot to turn the thing on again. I\nknow that there\u2019s a setting in the driver to permanently turn it on but last\ntime I did that, I could see sparks flying when switching the USB-C cable to a\ndifferent machine. I\u2019ll take \u201ccan you hear me?\u201d over sparks any day, so I keep\nit off.\n\nMicrophone: I bought the Shure Beta 87A also years ago after reading through\nMarco Arment\u2019s microphone reviews. I really don\u2019t know enough about\nmicrophones to know how this one stacks up against a lot of others, but I do\nknow that it sounds better than the Blue Yeti I had before.\n\nI never really think about this microphone because it really just does its\njob, so: A+.\n\nMicrophone Arm: it\u2019s an Elgato Wave Mic Arm LP. Quite the name and also quite\nnew. I bought this a couple of months ago after getting fed up with the cheap-\nish microphone arm that I had before. The old one started to squeak and the\nmicrophone didn\u2019t stay in place and the arm would also cover the laptop on the\nside and I thought there has to be a better way. Turns out there is.\n\nThis microphone arm is amazing. Yes. It\u2019s incredibly solid, it\u2019s quiet, it\nkeeps the microphone where it should, I can hide the mic and my headphone\ncable in it \u2014 should\u2019ve bought this one sooner. Highly recommend it.\n\nHeadphones: these are Bose QC-45 that I\u2019ve bought after years of using Bose\nQC-25.\n\nHeadphones are very important to me. I wear them for ten hours on a workday,\neasily. And I always, always have noise-cancelling on. I don\u2019t listen to a lot\nof music anymore when working, but in a house with two small kids the barely-\nperceptible hum of the active noise cancelling doing its job is one of the\nsweeter sounds in my life.\n\nBut after years of using the QC-25 (and loving them!) it started to feel a\nlittle bit dumb to recharge the batteries every couple of days. I would\nconstantly have batteries lying around here and the charger would always be\nplugged in. \u201cDon\u2019t they build these headphones with built-in batteries\nnowadays?\u201d I thought and then bought the Bose 700.\n\nThe Bose 700 were great, but they\u2019re too tight and after wearing them for ten\nhours per day, my ears would start to sweat (did you expect that there\u2019d be\nthis much sweat in this post? I didn\u2019t) and things would become uncomfortable.\n\nThen someone told me that the QC-45 are basically the QC-25 but rechargeable\nvia USB-c and, bingo, that\u2019s exactly what they are and why I love them. Very\ncomfortable, great-sounding (to my sweaty ears) headphones.\n\nMouse: this mouse has probably the greatest of all the names in this line-up \u2014\nit\u2019s a Razer DeathAdder V2.\n\nYes, it\u2019s a gaming mouse that has colored lights in it and it\u2019s called\nDeathAdder. Don\u2019t I have some self-respect? Well, I thought we answered that\nwith No when we talked about butt pain, but listen: this mouse is amazing.\n\nFor years I\u2019ve used Apple\u2019s Magic Trackpad and loved it. Then I developed some\npain in my right hand and went looking for a mouse. At first I used a cheap,\nvertical mouse that I found on Amazon and that was okay but it wasn\u2019t great.\n\n(Also: using a vertical mouse feels as cool as wearing compression socks on a\nlong flight - sorry vertical mice users.)\n\nThen I bought a gaming mouse from Steelcase. I can\u2019t remember the name but I\u2019m\nsure it also sounded like an Iron Maiden album. That impressed me. It felt\ncomfortable and precise and a lot of the annoyances I\u2019ve had with the Magic\nTrackpad or other mice just went away.\n\nBut then the scroll wheel broke and I bought the (I wish I could play some\nmusic here:) Razer DeathAdder and it changed my life. It\u2019s so good. The click,\nman. Just that click alone makes you reconsider why you ever used a trackpad\nat all. Then you notice how light it is, then you notice that the cable is\nalso very light and basically feels wireless, and then you notice that\npointing at stuff on the screen and resizing things and selecting stuff is\nsuddenly easier and, oh my god, the two buttons on the side allow you to go\nforward and back in the browser? I don\u2019t know how else to put it, but after\nyears of using only trackpads switching to a very good mouse feels like waking\nfrom a bad dream. Try it.\n\n(I\u2019ve convinced three other people to switch to gaming mice and they all say\nit\u2019s life-changing.)\n\nWebcam: probably one of the oldest pieces of hardware I still have. It\u2019s a\nLogitech C920 HD Pro Webcam and I think it\u2019s pretty, pretty good for how much\nit cost.\n\nYes, there are better cameras, and I\u2019m curious to try one, but I think in\nwebcam land there are these ~100 bucks webcams on one side, then there\u2019s a\nvery wide and deep valley, and then there are the professional cameras on the\nother side for which you pay hundreds if not thousands of bucks. I don\u2019t know\nwhether I want to cross that valley. I\u2019ve heard that you have to use HDMI\nadapters and battery adapters and that the cameras overheat and don\u2019t reliably\nwork and it all sounds like a (sing it with me:) big pain in the butt. So I\u2019m\nsticking with this one until someone tells me \u201cbuy this one, it\u2019s twice as\ngood and you don\u2019t ever have to worry about it.\u201d\n\nLights: the one on the left is a Elgato Key Light Air and the one on the right\nis an Elgato Ring Light (that name probably would\u2019ve been enough for you to\ndistinguish them, huh).\n\nI first bought the Ring Light because I thought I could get away with only a\nsingle light. Quickly realized that when you have glasses and you mount a ring\nlight right behind the camera it constantly looks like you have two small ring\nlights in your face. Stay away from ring lights if you have glasses.\n\nSo then I ordered the smaller Key Light Air and moved both to the sides of the\ndesk. Now they work pretty well. I can adjust the light on my phone, or in the\nmenu bar on macOS, or through Home Assistant.\n\nAnd let me tell you something: before you worry about your webcam or camera,\nyou should get a good light. Consistent lighting makes a huge difference.\n\nThat\u2019s also why I bought these. I don\u2019t have strong lights in this room, so in\nZoom calls or in video recordings, the lighting and thus the quality of my\nwebcam video was determined by what I had open on screen. If I had a blank,\nwhite page open everything would look crisp and properly lit. When I then\nswitched to the dark terminal, quality dropped.\n\nSo I got some lights to have consistent video quality, no matter what time of\nday or what application I have maximized. Recommended move.\n\nMug: this is an Ember Smart Mug. A smart mug. A smart mug. Yes. I can connect\nto it via Bluetooth and tell it to keep my coffee at a certain temperature and\nthe Ember app even allows you to connect to \u201cmultiple devices\u201d and you can\ncreate an account to sync your \u201cdevice settings\u201d and I can configure the color\nof the light on the outside of the mug \u2014 yes, it\u2019s all very ridiculous. But!\n(No, only one T in this one)\n\nBut I won it in a quiz at Sourcegraph (which is also why there\u2019s a Sourcegraph\nlogo on it), so no, I didn\u2019t spend money on a smart mug, but yes, I\u2019ve been\nusing it every day since then and the battery is often empty and I forget to\nrecharge it but when it\u2019s charged and I forget to drink my coffee and get a\npush notification that says \u201cYour coffee has reached perfect temperature\u201d I\nfeel a bit embarrassed but also happy.\n\nSo, take that for what it\u2019s worth.\n\nKeyboard: it\u2019s Keychron Q3 with Gateron G Pro Brown switches.\n\nIt\u2019s great, it works flawlessly, the switches sound nice, I can type up to\n140wpm on it, it\u2019s fucking heavy. It\u2019s so heavy that the package arrived and\nthe guy handed it to me I thought \u201cwhat the fuck did I order?! this can\u2019t be\nthe keyboard.\u201d It\u2019s so heavy that it never, ever moves, which is great.\n\nI don\u2019t know what else to say here, though. I think I kinda lost my appetite\nfor mechanical keyboards over the years. I started using a KUL ES-87 in 2015.\nBack then with Cherry MX Blue switches. I loved it and also convinced my\ncolleagues to switch to mechanical keyboards (quite the sound in that office).\nThen I got a Topre and didn\u2019t fall in love that much. Then, years later, I got\na cheap one off of Amazon and that was also nice but started to fall apart, so\nnow I got this Keychron Q3.\n\nBut... I also wonder whether I shouldn\u2019t switch to the Apple Magic Keyboard\nagain. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever typed faster on any keyboard than on the\ntenkeyless Apple Magic Keyboard.\n\nMonitor: this is a brand-new Dell U2723QE. It\u2019s a 27-inch 4k monitor with a\nbuilt-in USB hub and it\u2019s really nice.\n\nI\u2019ve had an HP Z27 for the past 5 years and, like I wrote above, it started to\nbreak down so I went looking for a replacement.\n\nOne big requirement for me was that the monitor has a built-in USB hub,\nbecause I want to connect all the peripherals to the monitor so that I can\njust switch which computers is attached to the monitor and all the peripherals\ngo along with it.\n\nWith the HP Z27 I could do that: mouse, keyboard, audio interface, and webcam\nwere all connected to the monitor. I could then use a single USB-C cable to\nconnect the monitor and peripherals to a MacBook, while also charging the\nMacBook. The desktop computer was connected to the monitor via DisplayPort and\na separate USB-A-to-USB-C cable was used to connect the USB-Hub part of the\nmonitor to the desktop computer. That means I had a small USB-C cable attached\nto the monitor and I could then plug either the MacBook or the desktop\ncomputer into this USB-C cable to connect one or the other.\n\nNow, with the Dell U2723QE (DeathAdder isn\u2019t such a bad name after all, is\nit?), I don\u2019t have to change a single cable! I just have to press a button on\nthe back of the monitor to switch between computers.\n\nI know you\u2019ve been waiting for it, so here\u2019s a diagram:\n\nHow it\u2019s all connected. (Diagram created with Monodraw, a beautiful piece of\nsoftware)\n\nLike I said: switching to that monitor allowed me to get rid of a small\nadapter cable and another USB-A-to-USB-C cable \u2014 isn\u2019t that a huge payoff that\nmakes talking about butt pain and forearm sweat worth it?\n\nIf you liked this one, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll like the next post even more, so\nsubscribe:\n\n5 Likes\n\nShare this post\n\n#### My Setup, April 2024\n\nregisterspill.thorstenball.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nTwo types of software engineers\n\nOne assumes it's easy because it's a non-technical problem, the other assumes\nthat's why it's hard\n\nApr 9, 2023 \u2022\n\nThorsten Ball\n\n51\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Two types of software engineers\n\nregisterspill.thorstenball.com\n\n14\n\nFrom 1s to 4ms\n\nSo zero-cost abstractions exist?\n\nFeb 17 \u2022\n\nThorsten Ball\n\n27\n\nShare this post\n\n#### From 1s to 4ms\n\nregisterspill.thorstenball.com\n\n8\n\nA Few Words on Testing\n\nOr: Losing Faith\n\nMar 16 \u2022\n\nThorsten Ball\n\n40\n\nShare this post\n\n#### A Few Words on Testing\n\nregisterspill.thorstenball.com\n\n6\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Thorsten Ball\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
