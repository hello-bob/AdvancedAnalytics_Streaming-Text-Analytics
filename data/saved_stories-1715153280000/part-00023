All but a\nhandful in his 100-strong team were Chinese nationals. Employees spoke in\nMandarin and addressed each other as tong xue \u2014 an endearing term widely used\nin Chinese tech companies meaning \u201cclassmate.\u201d\n\nOn his first day, Ben\u2019s manager walked him through Lark, the proprietary work\ncommunication app of ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok. He was\nsurprised to find that the onboarding file and work messages on Lark were\nmostly in Chinese. \u201cIt was a reverse culture shock,\u201d said Ben, who had\npreviously worked at an American company and spoke to Rest of World under a\npseudonym. \u201c[TikTok] is more Chinese than what I\u2019m used to.\u201d\n\nThe 658,000-square-foot San Jose campus Ben works from is currently TikTok\u2019s\nlargest office in the U.S., with over 4,000 employees. The massive team was\nbuilt in a mere two years. TikTok surged in popularity among American\nteenagers during the pandemic and now has 170 million U.S. users. Last year,\nByteDance\u2019s reported revenue nearly matched that of Meta, which would make it\none of the world\u2019s most lucrative internet technology companies. But in the\nU.S., TikTok has also been beset by allegations of potential censorship and\ndata security breaches. Last month, U.S. President Joe Biden signed into law a\nbill that would push ByteDance to sell the app within 270 days, or leave the\ncountry. TikTok has pledged to challenge the law.\n\nU.S. politicians had been floating a TikTok divestiture or ban for years,\nciting national security concerns. To fend off political pressure, the company\nhas downplayed its China connections. TikTok appointed non-Chinese executives,\nand its current chief executive Shou Zi Chew, is based in Singapore. The\ncompany set up headquarters in Singapore and Los Angeles, and moved U.S. user\ndata to Oracle servers.\n\nBut more than a dozen current and former U.S.-based TikTok employees who spoke\nto Rest of World, most of whom requested anonymity for fear of retaliation\nfrom the company, say that TikTok\u2019s ties to ByteDance go further than what the\ncompany presents. They say ByteDance executives, and not Chew, manage key\ndepartments made up of thousands of U.S.-based TikTok employees. In recent\nyears, managers from Douyin, TikTok\u2019s Chinese sister app, have been\ntransferred to the U.S. to help replicate that app\u2019s commercial success. Rest\nof World\u2019s sources also provided additional details corroborating reporting in\noutlets like Forbes and The Wall Street Journal about ByteDance executives\u2019\ninvolvement in TikTok.\n\n> 4000 The number of employees at TikTok\u2019s San Jose office.\n\nThe deep ties between ByteDance and TikTok underscore the difficulty of\nseparating the two entities. It also means a potential divestiture could\ndeprive TikTok of key Chinese management personnel and technologies.\n\nBen\u2019s team, for example, works on a core element of TikTok\u2019s business:\nmonetization. The team, which has 3,000 members, optimizes the flow of\nadvertisements shown to the audience to maximize click-through rate\nconversion, thereby driving revenue growth. Industry observers consider\nmonetization, as well as TikTok\u2019s powerful search function and its For You\nrecommendation algorithm, as one of the app\u2019s three \u201csecret sauces.\u201d\n\nHowever, Ben said that according to the official reporting line charts on\nLark, his department reports to ByteDance veteran Zhang Lidong, the company\u2019s\nhead of commercialization, and not Chew. Ben said that decisions on his team\nare often made only after consulting with a senior manager based in China.\n\nA TikTok spokesperson told Rest of World that they have \u201calways been clear\u201d\nabout the relationship between TikTok and ByteDance and that many of the\nstatements from Rest of World\u2019s sources were false.\n\n\u201cOur CEO, Shou Chew, has authority over TikTok budgets and strategy.\nSignificant projects and capital expenditures are coordinated with the parent\ncompany, following appropriate fiduciary obligations. Those obligations\ninclude responsibility to our Board of Directors and investors, roughly 60% of\nwhich are international investors, 20% are the company\u2019s founders, and 20% are\nour employees \u2014 including thousands of Americans,\u201d said the spokesperson.\n\nTikTok did not respond to Rest of World\u2019s request for clarity on what\ninformation from sources was false or what \u201csignificant projects\u201d at TikTok\ninvolve coordination with ByteDance.\n\nTikTok\u2019s CEO, Shou Zi Chew, testifies during a Senate Judiciary Committee\nhearing in Washington, U.S., on January 31, 2024. Nathan Howard/Reuters/Redux\n\nAccording to a 2023 statement TikTok posted on its Australian site, the\ncompany claims that Chew oversees \u201call key day-to-day and strategic decision\nmaking.\u201d In a 2022 letter to U.S. legislators, TikTok said ByteDance did play\na role in hiring key personnel at TikTok, but the company was led by Chew. In\nreality, employees say, many key strategic and personnel decisions at TikTok\ncome from ByteDance executives.\n\nInternally, employees and managers call the company \u201cByteDance\u201d and \u201cTikTok\u201d\ninterchangeably, as most tech teams work closely with China-based Douyin\nstaffers. A senior TikTok engineer told Rest of World he estimates that the\ntech teams, which include software engineers, product managers, and user\nexperience designers, have 40% to 60% of their members based in China.\n\n\u201cBecause Douyin is so crazily successful, there\u2019s a knee-jerk reaction to say,\nhey, we need to replicate that overseas,\u201d Chris Pereira, founder of\nconsultancy iMpact, which advises Chinese firms on global expansion, told Rest\nof World.\n\n> \u201cManagement talks about TikTok as if it is the underachieving sibling. It is\n> clear that Douyin is the parents\u2019 favorite.\u201d\n\nHowever, TikTok teams that interact with American clients, users, and\nregulatory bodies, according to three current and former employees, have fewer\nChinese employees. The U.S. Data Security team, set up to protect American\nuser data and address American national security concerns, exclusively hires\nU.S. citizens or permanent residents. Some new teams at TikTok launched after\n2022 are completely U.S.-based, three sources told Rest of World.\n\nSenior employees say that the reliance on ByteDance executives at TikTok is\ntied to the company\u2019s desire to replicate Douyin\u2019s staggering profitability\nwithin China. Although TikTok has achieved global commercial success, Douyin\ndwarfs TikTok in revenue and remains the company\u2019s biggest moneymaker. The\napp, which is available only in China, now offers everything from shopping to\nfood delivery and mobile games. Executives within ByteDance often cite Douyin\nwhen setting goals and strategies for TikTok. \u201cManagement talks about TikTok\nas if it is the underachieving sibling. It is clear that Douyin is the\nparents\u2019 favorite,\u201d a senior software engineer said.\n\nPrevious reporting has outlined the interconnectedness between Douyin and\nTikTok. According to Rui Ma, a China tech analyst who co-wrote a Harvard\nBusiness Review report on ByteDance\u2019s organizational strategy, the company\npools together key personnel from different departments, such as software\nengineers, designers, and data scientists, to form shared-service platforms\n(SSP).\n\n\u201cIt was a common practice among Chinese internet companies, but no one got it\nto work like ByteDance,\u201d Ma told Rest of World. \u201cThis allows ByteDance to keep\nits core assets, like algorithms, close and rely on its bigger source of\nChinese talent, instead of trying to build [staffing] from scratch in the\nU.S.\u201d But that also means it would be challenging for TikTok to operate\nindependently without the support of its China-based ByteDance staff, Ma said.\n\nTikTok\u2019s close relationship to ByteDance has significant benefits for its\noperations. ByteDance executives, for example, can seamlessly transfer lessons\nover from Douyin. But the involvement of China-based managers in TikTok\u2019s U.S.\noperations also exposes TikTok to political vulnerabilities. \u201cBeing a Chinese\ncompany is TikTok\u2019s biggest asset but also its biggest risk,\u201d Ivy Yang, a\nChina tech analyst and founder of consulting firm Wavelet Strategy, told Rest\nof World.\n\n> \u201cBeing a Chinese company is TikTok\u2019s biggest asset but also its biggest\n> risk.\u201d\n\nWhile U.S. tech companies often operate using the same tactics as ByteDance \u2014\ndeploying American executives to manage international teams, for instance \u2014\nwith heightened U.S.-China tensions, any traces of personnel and data\ntransfers between the two entities can draw the attention of American\nlegislators. It also raises the question of whether TikTok could be considered\na separate entity, making a potential sale difficult.\n\nByteDance\u2019s failure in giving American local employees more say in running\nTikTok has made the app vulnerable to criticism, but a potential sale could\nhelp address those issues, said Pereira. He thinks TikTok might be able to\nmore successfully localize if it gets acquired by an American company. \u201c[In\nthe] long term, the more local, the better,\u201d he said.\n\nCurrent employees know that TikTok\u2019s promised legal fight against the new bill\nis likely to last years. Some say they are keeping an eye out for new jobs,\ngiven TikTok\u2019s ongoing existential crisis. That hasn\u2019t dampened the sense of\ncamaraderie between Chinese-speaking colleagues on Ben\u2019s team.\n\n\u201cIt feels like a college campus,\u201d said Ben, who often goes to the cafeteria\nfor lunch and sits with a group of his project teammates, who are mostly male\nChinese nationals in their twenties. Common conversation topics include visa\nstatus, compensation packages at different tech companies, video games, and\ndating struggles in the Bay Area.\n\n\u201cSometimes I feel bad for the only white guy on the team, because he cannot be\npart of this,\u201d said Ben. \u201cI try to eat with him once in a while.\u201d\n\nCaiwei Chen is a Rest of World reporter based in New York.\n\nViola Zhou is a Rest of World reporter based in New York City.\n\nRead more stories\n\nEV Revolution\n\nIndians who pre-ordered Teslas in 2016 are giving up and chasing refunds\n\nElon Musk dodged another India visit, and many who placed $1,000 Tesla\ndeposits admit the dream is over, while fanboys keep the faith.\n\nBy Ananya Bhattacharya\n\nExporter Newsletter\n\nWhatsApp gives India an ultimatum on encryption\n\nTracing the origins of messages is more complicated than it sounds.\n\nBy Russell Brandom\n\nThe Rise of AI\n\nIndian politicians are bringing the dead on the campaign trail, with help from\nAI\n\nDigital rights activists have questioned the ethics of using \u201csoft fakes\u201d to\nresurrect the past and manage the future.\n\nBy Barkha Dutt\n\n  * About us\n  * Jobs\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Platforms\n  * Newsletters\n  * Donate\n  * Contact us\n\n\u00a9 2024 Rest of World\n\n", "frontpage": true}
