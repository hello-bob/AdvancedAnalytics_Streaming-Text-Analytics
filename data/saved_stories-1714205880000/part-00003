Everyone is ogling at each other\u2019s lives\nand personalities, but no one is engaging with them.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why she spent the last 10 years studying social media habits to create\na new app called Nospace, which is slated for its official release at the end\nof April. Zhong promises to deliver Gen Z a social media experience akin to\nthe one millennials once had, via Myspace and early Facebook: personalized\nprofile pages and a stream of casual updates, like what you had for breakfast\nor what new band you\u2019re obsessed with. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem we\u2019re solving:\nconnection with others and self-expression,\u201d she said. Over 380,000 people are\non the waitlist.\n\nNospace will allow users to customize their profiles, share updates on what\nthey\u2019re \u201cwatching, eating, reading, listening to IRL,\u201d and \u201cstar\u201d or flag\ntheir interests, so they can find others with similar tastes. It will also\nlist your closest friends (yes, similar to Myspace\u2019s Top 8).\n\nNospace joins a growing category of new platforms inspired by the old ones.\nOther examples include Youni, which describes itself as a platform for sharing\nIRL memories, and PI.FYI, an app built around recommendations (\u201cYou can think\nof PI.FYI as Letterboxd or Goodreads meets Myspace,\u201d its website reads). It\nseems that, along with Y2K fashion and point-and-shoot cameras, Gen Zers are\nalso pining for a return to 2000s social media.\n\nCourtesy of Nospace\n\nCourtesy of Nospace\n\n1 / 2\n\nBoth Youni and PI.FYI are selling a chance to connect with others rather than\npassively consuming their content. As Youni\u2019s co-creator, Georgia Gibson,\nshared in a promo TikTok that went viral last week: \u201cYouni helps you make\nmemories; Instagram, TikTok, Facebook helps you make media. We are the only\nsocial network that focuses solely on growing your network in real life \u2018cause\nconnections are what counts \u2014 not likes.\u201d\n\nWith PI.FYI, which grew out of the popular newsletter Perfectly Imperfect,\n28-year-old founder Tyler Bainbridge tells Bustle he \u201cwanted to build a new\nplace that's specifically designed to share what you love, while nurturing\nyour own taste.\u201d Users are asked to share a breadth of interests, like their\nfavorite movies, albums, recipes, quotes, and mantras, so like-minded people\ncan find each other.\n\n\u201cWe're losing the human touch of a personal recommendation as the internet\ngets For-You-Page-ified,\u201d Bainbridge added.\n\nGen Z has grown up immersed in algorithmically-driven social media, and now \u2014\nemerging from a pandemic and its economic repercussions \u2014 they want more\nsimplicity and kinship. They\u2019re sidestepping dating apps when seeking love,\nand turning away from Instagram and TikTok when seeking friendship. \u201cGen Z\nsimply are sick of the same old, same old when it comes to social media,\u201d says\nKatya Varbanova, a brand marketing strategist. \u201cThey\u2019re craving new\nexperiences mainstream apps aren\u2019t able to produce ... add information\noverload to that, [and] the comparanoia can lead to anxiety, [eating\ndisorders], and mental health struggles. No wonder Gen Z are craving places\nthat make them feel better, not worse.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of PI.FYI\n\nWhile much research on the subject has been inconclusive, some evidence\nsuggests that social media has negatively affected young users. Last year,\nUnited States Surgeon General Vivek Murthy released a report advising the\npublic that increased social media use can cause harm to your mental health,\nincluding impacting one\u2019s self-esteem, sleep, and physical activities.\n\nOne way zoomers are trying to improve their experiences on social media is by\nleveling the playing field. Instead of rewarding people for flaunting\naspirational lives, or putting certain people (like influencers) on a\npedestal, newer platforms focus more on one-to-one interactions. There are no\nsubjects and fans, just peers.\n\nErika Abdelatif, the social media director for Her Campus Media, points out\nthat users are already doing their best to turn algorithmically-driven\nplatforms into group chats, a more democratic medium. \u201cAccording to the head\nof Instagram, Adam Mosseri, the majority of time spent on Instagram today\nisn\u2019t engaging with feed posts \u2014 it\u2019s spent in the DMs and on stories,\u201d\nAbdelatif says, referring to Mosseri\u2019s 2023 video unpacking how the popular\napp\u2019s algorithm works. \u201cIn other words: they\u2019re in their DMs laughing over\nmemes, going down internet rabbit holes, and discussing current events online\nmore frequently than hanging out or texting.\u201d\n\n> There are no subjects and fans, just peers.\n\nIn fact, users who've piloted the platform have told her it's like a giant\nglobal group chat. On Nospace, there will be a \u201cfriends only\u201d feed you can\ncurate for just your closest network, and a chronological global feed, where\nyou can see what every active user is doing or thinking in real time.\n\n\u201cAll these other apps these days, it\u2019s just algorithmic. A lot of posts just\nget pushed down if you don\u2019t get engagement,\u201d Zhong says. She has created a\ngamified feature for Nospace called a \u201cboost\u201d \u2014 a feature similar to a like on\nFacebook or heart on Instagram \u2014 but it won\u2019t allow users to power-rank each\nother\u2019s content; it will simply be for \u201cfun,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt feels like a\ngame. People love leveling up. You get unlimited boosts ... Everyone can feel\nspecial.\u201d\n\nShe hopes apps like hers can encourage more self-expression and bonding.\n\u201cLoneliness is increasing because of a variety of reasons,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\ndon\u2019t have as much to talk about with our IRL friends anymore because everyone\nwatches different content. It\u2019s not like we have the same Sunday shows, or the\nsame shows that drop the same episodes every week.\u201d She hopes Nospace\u2019s\nchronological status updates and focus on finding shared interests will\naddress this issue.\n\n\u201cIt feels lonely to be in a world where we\u2019re just watching our own content,\nor our own personalized feed of content and videos, instead of connecting with\nothers,\u201d she says. \u201cSocializing is so much more important than ever. It\ndoesn\u2019t exist anymore.\u201d\n\n", "frontpage": false}
