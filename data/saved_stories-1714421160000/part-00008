It was a crowded car, rush hour, with the dim but unwarm\nlighting of the oldest New York City trains. The stranger\u2019s phone was bright,\nand as I looked on she scrolled through a waterfall of videos that other\npeople had filmed in their homes. She watched one for four or five seconds,\nthen dispatched it by twitching her thumb. She flicked to a text message, did\nnothing with it, and flipped back. The figures on her screen, dressed\ncarefully and mugging at the camera like mimes, seemed desperate for something\nthat she could not provide: her sustained attention. I felt mortified, not\nleast because I saw on both sides of the screen symptoms I recognized too\nclearly in myself.\n\nFor years, we have heard a litany of reasons why our capacity to pay attention\nis disturbingly on the wane. Technology\u2014the buzzing, blinking pageant on our\nscreens and in our pockets\u2014hounds us. Modern life, forever quicker and more\nscattered, drives concentration away. For just as long, concerns of this\nvariety could be put aside. Television was described as a force against\nattention even in the nineteen-forties. A lot of focussed, worthwhile work has\ntaken place since then.\n\nBut alarms of late have grown more urgent. Last year, the Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development reported a huge ten-year decline in\nreading, math, and science performance among fifteen-year-olds globally, a\nthird of whom cited digital distraction as an issue. Clinical presentations of\nattention problems have climbed (a recent study of data from the medical-\nsoftware company Epic found an over-all tripling of A.D.H.D. diagnoses between\n2010 and 2022, with the steepest uptick among elementary-school-age children),\nand college students increasingly struggle to get through books, according to\ntheir teachers, many of whom confess to feeling the same way. Film pacing has\naccelerated, with the average length of a shot decreasing; in music, the mean\nlength of top-performing pop songs declined by more than a minute between 1990\nand 2020. A study conducted in 2004 by the psychologist Gloria Mark found that\nparticipants kept their attention on a single screen for an average of two and\na half minutes before turning it elsewhere. These days, she writes, people can\npay attention to one screen for an average of only forty-seven seconds.\n\n\u201cAttention as a category isn\u2019t that salient for younger folks,\u201d Jac Mullen, a\nwriter and a high-school teacher in New Haven, told me recently. \u201cIt takes a\nlot to show that how you pay attention affects the outcome\u2014that if you focus\nyour attention on one thing, rather than dispersing it across many things, the\none thing you think is hard will become easier\u2014but that\u2019s a level of\ninstruction I often find myself giving.\u201d It\u2019s not the students\u2019 fault, he\nthinks; multitasking and its euphemism, \u201ctime management,\u201d have become goals\nacross the pedagogic field. The SAT was redesigned this spring to be forty-\nfive minutes shorter, with many reading-comprehension passages trimmed to two\nor three sentences. Some Ivy League professors report being counselled to\nswitch up what they\u2019re doing every ten minutes or so to avoid falling behind\ntheir students\u2019 churn. What appears at first to be a crisis of attention may\nbe a narrowing of the way we interpret its value: an emergency about where\u2014and\nwith what goal\u2014we look.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, it\u2019s the oldest question in advertising: how to get attention,\u201d\nan executive named Joanne Leong told me one afternoon, in a conference room on\nthe thirteenth floor of the midtown office of the Dentsu agency. We were\nspeaking about a new attention market. Slides were projected on the wall, and\nbits of conversation rattled like half-melted ice cubes in the corridor\noutside. For decades, what was going on between an advertisement and its\nviewers was unclear: there was no consensus about what attention was or how to\nquantify it. \u201cThe difference now is that there\u2019s better tech to measure it,\u201d\nLeong said.\n\nDentsu is one of the world\u2019s leading advertising agencies, running accounts\nfor Heineken, Hilton, Kraft Heinz, Microsoft, Subway, and other global\ncorporations. In 2019, the firm began using digital technology to gather data\nthat showed not only how many people attended to its ads but in what ways they\ndid\u2014information that could be applied to derive a quantitative unit of\nattention value. In 1997, the technology pundit Michael Goldhaber had\nenvisaged a world in which attention supplanted money as a dominant currency.\n(\u201cIf you have enough attention, you can get anything you want,\u201d he lamented.)\nSince then, advertising has caught up with the trade.\n\n\u201cSix years ago, the question was around \u2018Can this usefully be measured?\u2019 \u201d\nLeong said. Now it\u2019s a circus. \u201cThere are companies that use eye tracking.\nThere are companies that do facial coding\u201d\u2014reading emotions through micro-\nexpressions. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer a matter of convincing clients that this is\nsomething they should lean into\u2014it\u2019s how.\u201d\n\nThere is a long-standing, widespread belief that attention carries value. In\nEnglish, attention is something that we \u201cpay.\u201d In Spanish, it is \u201clent.\u201d The\nSwiss literary scholar Yves Citton, whose study of the digital age, \u201cThe\nEcology of Attention,\u201d argues against reducing attention to economic terms,\nsuggested to me that it was traditionally considered valuable because it was\ncapable of bestowing value. \u201cBy paying attention to something as if it\u2019s\ninteresting, you make it interesting. By evaluating it, you valorize it,\u201d he\nsaid. To treat it as a mere market currency, he thought, was to undersell what\nit could do.\n\nAdvertisers\u2019 interest in attention as a measure was sharpened with the\npublication of \u201cThe Attention Economy\u201d (2001), by Thomas H. Davenport and John\nC. Beck, which offered a theory of attention as a prelude to action: we pay\nattention in order to do (or buy). But there have long been varied views. The\nneuroscientist Karl Friston has suggested that attention is a way of\nprioritizing and tuning sensory data. Simone Weil, one of attention\u2019s eloquent\nphilosophers, also resisted the idea of attention as subject to economic\nmeasure.\n\nIn the Dentsu office, Leong, who had her hair in a neat ponytail and wore a\nsweater with wide, simple horizontal stripes, sat beside the company\u2019s head of\nresearch and measurement, Celeste Castle, an executive who oversees the math\nbehind Dentsu\u2019s own answer to the question of attention\u2019s worth\u2014the \u201ceffective\nattention cost per a thousand\u201d impressions. The old metrics used in\nadvertising were based on an opportunity to see. \u201cAn \u2018impression\u2019 is just a\nmeasure that the ad was served,\u201d Leong said. But recent data revealed that\neven most supposedly \u201cviewable\u201d ads weren\u2019t being viewed. \u201cConsumers\u2019 span of\nattention is now believed to be less than eight seconds,\u201d Raja Rajamannar, the\nchief marketing officer of Mastercard, a Dentsu client, told me. \u201cThat is less\nthan the attention span of a goldfish.\u201d\n\nVideo From The New Yorker\n\nAt Dentsu, as elsewhere, the aim has become to get more from these shrinking\nslivers\u2014an endeavor some outsiders liken to fracking, the process used to\nforce lingering pockets of fossil fuels out of the earth. When I asked whether\nthese efforts would dissipate people\u2019s focus further, Castle said that\noptimizing would result in ads being even more precisely tailored to entice\ntheir audiences. \u201cAs attention measurement matures, things will fall by the\nwayside and we can eliminate some of the waste,\u201d she said.\n\nIn \u201cScenes of Attention,\u201d a collection of scholarly essays published last\nyear, the editors, D. Graham Burnett and Justin Smith-Ruiu, challenge the idea\nthat shortened attention spans came about because of technological\nacceleration alone. True, tools and lives are faster, they write. But claiming\ninnovation as the original cause is backward: \u201cHuman beings make the\ntechnologies\u2014and they make them in the context of other human beings needing\nand wanting various things.\u201d It wasn\u2019t as though people, after millennia of\nhead-scratching, suddenly \u201cdiscovered\u201d the steam engine, the spinning jenny,\nand the telegraph, and modernity unspooled. Rather, people\u2019s priorities\nunderwent a sea change with the onset of the modern age, turning to\nefficiency, objective measurement, and other goals that made such inventions\nworthwhile. The acceleration of life isn\u2019t an inevitability, in that sense,\nbut an ideological outcome.\n\nBurnett, a historian of science at Princeton, is the author of five books,\nranging in subject from seventeenth-century lens-making to New York\u2019s judicial\nsystem. For the past several years, he has been working on a history of the\nscientific study of attention. I went one day to the main branch of the New\nYork Public Library to hear him speak at the invitation of the New York\nInstitute for the Humanities. \u201cIt was the sciences that sliced and diced this\nnebulous, difficult-to-define feature of our conscious and sensory life so\nthat the market could price it,\u201d Burnett said.\n\nAs an academic at the lectern, Burnett cut a curious figure. He was tall, with\na graying backpacker\u2019s beard and light-brown hair pulled into a topknot. He\nwore sixteen silver rings, gunmetal nail polish, and an outfit\u2014T-shirt, V-neck\nsweater-vest, climbing pants\u2014entirely in shades of light gray. He looked as if\nhe had arrived from soldering metal in an abandoned loft. Scientific models of\nattention, he argued, had been products of their eras\u2019 priorities, too. So-\ncalled \u201cvigilance studies,\u201d which figured attention in terms of cognitive\nalertness, had coincided with the rise of monotonous control-panel jobs in the\nyears after the Second World War. When soldiers began having to deal with\nmultiple directives over the wire, attention science became preoccupied with\nsimultaneous inputs.\n\n\u201cCan we set the flame to medium high?\u201d\n\nCartoon by Amy Hwang\n\nLink copied\n\nIt was a short leap from there to attention-chasing advertising. Companies\nthat once resigned themselves to using billboards and print ads to appeal to a\nlarge American public now target us in private moments. The legal scholar Tim\nWu, in his book \u201cThe Attention Merchants,\u201d notes, \u201cWithout express consent,\nmost of us have passively opened ourselves up to the commercial exploitation\nof our attention just about anywhere and any time.\u201d No wonder young people\nstruggle. Burnett, in an opinion piece that he co-wrote in the Times last\nfall, argued that schools, rather than just expecting students to pay\nattention, should teach them how.\n\nI visited Burnett one afternoon in Washington Heights, where he lives with his\npartner, the filmmaker Alyssa Loh, and his two teen-age children. The windows\nof his living room were open; breezes off the Hudson River twirled silver\nspiral streamers hanging from the ceiling. A sideboard featured a blown\nostrich egg, delicately etched with an image of the bird\u2019s skeleton\u2014a gift\nfrom a student.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect mix of scrimshaw technique and X-ray of the form of the bird,\u201d\nBurnett commented from an open kitchen. He was chopping radishes for a salad.\n\nThe rest of the living room was artily posed, as if presented for study by\nvisitors. There was a faded dhurrie rug and a dining-room table made from a\nsingle slab of tree trunk. In one corner, a kind of altar had been assembled\nwith peculiar objects: a feather-trimmed bow and arrow from Guyana; a bird\nskeleton; and a short stack of old leather-bound books, such as the first\nEnglish edition of \u201cL\u2019Oiseau\u201d (\u201cThe Bird\u201d), a nineteenth-century study of\nbirds by the historian Jules Michelet, and \u201cCanaries and Cage-Birds,\u201d by an\nornithologist named George H. Holden. I opened it. \u201cThe lectures on which\nthese chapters are based were appropriately announced as given under the\nauspices of one of our bird clubs,\u201d the book read, \u201cfor the word auspices\ncomes from the Latin avis,\u2014a bird,\u2014and spicere,\u2014to look at.\u201d\n\nThe passage touched a memory for me. Years earlier, I had heard of something\ncalled the Order of the Third Bird\u2014supposedly a secret international\nfellowship, going back centuries, of artists, authors, booksellers,\nprofessors, and avant-gardists. Participants in the Order would converge,\nflash-mob style, at museums, stare intensely at a work of art for half an\nhour, and vanish, their twee-seeming feat of attention complete. (The Order\u2019s\nname alluded to a piece of lore about three birds confronting a painting by\nthe ancient artist Zeuxis: the first was frightened away, the second\napproached to try to eat painted fruit, and the third just looked.) I had\ntried then to get in touch with the Order. My efforts had led nowhere. \u201cIt\u2019s a\nFight Club thing,\u201d someone later explained to me, with a degree of earnestness\nthat, like much about the Order of the Third Bird, I struggled to gauge. \u201cThe\nfirst rule of the Birds is you don\u2019t talk about the Birds.\u201d I\u2019d wondered\nwhether Burnett might be involved.\n\nBurnett was a longtime Bird, he admitted. The Order\u2019s work was more complex\nthan it sounded, he said, and some of the Birds, concerned about widespread\nloss of attention, were more willing to discuss their practice than they\u2019d\nbeen in the past. For years, the Order had devoted itself to its subject: what\nattention was, how to channel it, what it could do. With Burnett\u2019s help, I\nsent up a new flare in Birdland, expecting to hear nothing. That wasn\u2019t what\nhappened at all.\n\nOne Sunday morning, I received a cryptic text from a performance artist named\nStevie Knauss, whom I had never met. \u201cLet\u2019s tentatively plan on meeting in the\nzone indicated on this map,\u201d the message read. A Google satellite image of the\nneighborhood around 155th Street and Broadway was attached, with a red arrow\npointing to the Hispanic Society Museum & Library.\n\nLater, as the train that I was on travelled uptown, Knauss sent me a Find My\niPhone request. I followed it across Audubon Terrace, a plaza named for the\nnineteenth-century artist and ornithologist, and into the Hispanic Society\u2019s\ngallery. My eyes took a moment to adjust. At the place where my phone told me\nKnauss was stationed, a young woman in a black T-shirt sat on a bench with her\nback to me, staring at a painting. I sat beside her. \u201cStevie?\u201d I said.\n\nShe was wearing wide-legged green Dickies, high-laced leather work boots, and\ndangly asymmetrical earrings. She turned to regard me, then looked back at the\npainting.\n\nKnauss identified herself as an emissary affiliated with the Birds, and began\nto describe the way their actions worked. \u201cThe practice lasts twenty-eight\nminutes\u2014four parts of seven minutes each,\u201d she said. \u201cThe movement from one\npart to another is announced by a bell.\u201d\n\nKnauss told me that the Birds who were about to convene might not have met\nbefore. Actions were called in e-mails from alias accounts\u2014she had heard about\nthis one from \u201cWrybill Wrybillius\u201d\u2014with invitees\u2019 names hidden. Any Bird could\ncall an action; the Order was decentralized and ungoverned. Existing Birds\ninvited new participants at their discretion, and, in this way, the Order\nslowly brought additional people into local chapters, known as vol\u00e9es. Nobody\nwas sure how many Birds were in the world\u2014New York City alone was home to\nseveral vol\u00e9es, overlapping to some degree\u2014but there were believed to be\nhundreds. Actions had taken place as far afield as Korea, the Gal\u00e1pagos, and\nKansas.\n\nKnauss eyed some passersby. \u201cThe first seven-minute phase is known as\nEncounter,\u201d she said. \u201cI think of it as entering a party. First, you take a\nlook around the scene.\u201d On arriving at the action site, the Birds wander. The\nsubject of an action is rarely, if ever, identified in advance, but usually it\nis the most desperate-looking work in sight. (\u201cIn a museum, it will be, like,\nthe painting next to the bathroom or on the wall opposite the \u2018Mona Lisa,\u2019 \u201d\nBurnett told me.) The work is unnamed because the Birds are supposed to find\nit by paying attention. Those who don\u2019t can follow the flock.\n\nNext comes Attending, announced by the first bell. \u201cAt the party, that\u2019s when\nyou maybe settle into conversation with someone,\u201d Knauss explained. The Birds\nline up before the work, side by side, in what is known as the phalanx. For\nseven minutes, they silently give the work their full attention. Three things\nare discouraged during this period, Knauss told me. \u201cOne is what we call\nstudium\u201d\u2014analysis from study. Another is interpretation, and the third is\njudgment. If Birds find a work offensive (or simply bad), they\u2019re meant to put\naside that response. Alyssa Loh, Burnett\u2019s partner, who is also a Bird, told\nme that she understands the injunctions as a guard against the ways that\npeople shut down their attention. \u201cThere\u2019s a question you often hear in\nrelation to art objects: What is it for and what do you do with it?\u201d she said.\n\u201cIn the Bird practice, we mostly answer that in negatives\u2014you can\u2019t \u2018solve\u2019\nit, can\u2019t decide if it\u2019s good, can\u2019t victoriously declare that you have\ncorrectly identified its origins or that it\u2019s an example of an eighteenth-\ncentury whatever.\u201d You just keep attending.\n\nThe second bell heralds the start of Negation, a phase in which Birds try to\nclear the object from their minds. Some lie down; some close their eyes. At\nthe third bell, seven minutes later, the group reconvenes in the phalanx for\nRealizing.\n\nKnauss said, \u201cA good way to think of Realizing is the question: What does the\nwork need ?\u201d In some cases, the answer may be concrete\u2014to be moved to a nearby\nwall\u2014but it is often abstract. Perhaps a sculpture needs children climbing on\nit. \u201cIt might need you to hear its song,\u201d Knauss somewhat mysteriously noted.\nAt the final bell, the Birds disperse. \u201cLeave the scene, find somewhere quiet\nto sit, and write down your experience of the four phases,\u201d Knauss said.\n\nA short while later, they meet up, usually in a caf\u00e9, for Colloquy, in which\nthey take turns describing what they went through, distractions and all. Some\nBirds consider Colloquy the most important stage; it distinguishes their\napproach from \u201cmindfulness\u201d and other solo pursuits. The discussion can take\non an uncanny charge. \u201cIt\u2019s unusual to spend so much time in a small group\nlooking at one thing, and even more unusual to talk about your impressions to\nthe point of the ultra-thin vibrations and the associations they give rise\nto,\u201d a Bird named Adam Jasper, an assistant professor of architectural history\nat the Chinese University in Hong Kong, told me. \u201cWith people I\u2019ve Birded with\nmore than a few times, I know more about how they work emotionally and\nmentally than I have any right to.\u201d The writer Brad Fox described the\nexperience as \u201cseeing people at their best.\u201d\n\nKnauss, checking her phone, seemed suddenly in a hurry. \u201cI\u2019m going to leave\nyou,\u201d she said. \u201cBut first there\u2019s a tradition that I give you this.\u201d She\npulled a piece of saffron-colored cloth from one of her belt loops, tore off a\nstrip, and handed it to me. It was how the Birds recognized one another, she\nsaid.\n\n\u201cAfter I\u2019ve gone, you\u2019ll walk out the door over my left shoulder, onto the\nterrace, and turn right.\u201d She stood. \u201cThe work will be on your left.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how will I know which one it is?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll know,\u201d Knauss said, and walked away.\n\nOutside, in the sunlight, a mother was playing with her two children at a\nyellow installation by Jes\u00fas Rafael Soto: not a Bird. An older man sat at a\ntable: possible, but unlikely. Then I saw them: a tall, thin man and a\npregnant woman crossing the terrace, indistinguishable from other pedestrians\nbut for flashes of saffron like mine. The Birds were here.\n\nDespite all the recent laboratory study, attention was for centuries a path of\nhumanistic exchange. The Stoics wrote of prosoch\u0113, an alert attention, as a\nprerequisite of moral consciousness. For Freud, gleichschwebende\nAufmerksamkeit, \u201cevenly hovering attention,\u201d was the analyst\u2019s working mode.\nBurnett often cites Henry James\u2019s image of attention, in \u201cThe Wings of the\nDove,\u201d as a \u201cgreat empty cup\u201d on the table between a busy doctor and his\nsuffering patient\u2014what Burnett describes as \u201csomewhere between an offering and\na readiness to be receiving.\u201d\n\nIn many people\u2019s view, it is William James, Henry\u2019s brother, who supplied the\nfirst comprehensive American model of attention. In a chapter devoted to the\nsubject in his \u201cPrinciples of Psychology\u201d (1890), James portrayed attention as\na restless thing. When we think we\u2019re holding it, our mind is winging out on\nerrands and returning; sustained attention is, in effect, a stream of\nattentional moments. Thus, despite the complexity and multiplicity of the\nworld, \u201cthere is before the mind at no time a plurality of ideas.\u201d (This\ninsight went on to frame James\u2019s philosophical work.) When we look at a\nstatue, the stone doesn\u2019t change, but the art work we see does, because we are\ncontinually noticing different things. James\u2019s model pushes against the idea\nthat attention is something you pay out, free of wandering thoughts and\nindividual reverie.\n\nNested in James\u2019s understanding is also a serviceable definition of art. In\nits objective state, van Gogh\u2019s \u201cStarry Night\u201d is daubs of paint on a canvas.\nOn the moon, without an audience, it would be debris. It is only when I give\nthe canvas my attention (bringing to it the cargo of my particular past, my\nknowledge of the world, my way of thinking and seeing) that it becomes an art\nwork. That doesn\u2019t mean that van Gogh\u2019s feats of genius are imagined, or my\nown projection. It means only that an art work is neither a physical thing nor\na viewer\u2019s mental image of it but something in between, created in attentive\nspace. The Brazilian art critic and political activist M\u00e1rio Pedrosa wrote of\nthe experience as a dialogue between form and perception.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually pretty straightforward,\u201d Len Nalencz, another Bird, told me at\none point. \u201cThe Birds use attention as a medium\u2014like clay or words or marble\nor oil paint. You use your attention to make something, but only you can see\nthe thing you\u2019ve made. And so you have to translate it into words to share\nit.\u201d\n\nNalencz spent several years working as a union organizer, but now he is an\nassistant professor of English at the University of Mount St. Vincent, in the\nBronx. Many of the Birds I met were academics. A number expressed Faustian\ndismay at having mastered rigor in their fields without, it seemed, coming\ncloser to the human artistry that originally stirred their interest. Joanna\nFiduccia, an assistant professor of art history at Yale, told me, \u201cThere is an\nart historian, Michael Ann Holly, who writes about a \u2018melancholic\u2019 posture art\nhistorians have in knowing we\u2019re never actually going to get it right, never\ngoing to get to the thing that we were drawn to in the first place. Then\nBirding came along for me. It was this other way of being within art work that\nwas joyously collective and yet emergent from subjective consciousness, or\n\u2018experience.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a puzzle for all of us what to do with\u2014or even just how to be in\nthe presence of\u2014a work of art,\u201d Jeff Dolven, an English professor at Princeton\nand a Bird, said. \u201cHere we are together. Well, what do we do now?\u201d There is a\nmiddle-school-dance aspect to the endeavor: people feel something real across\nthe room but, without a way into the conversation, settle into wallflower\nanalysis. For some, the Birds provide a framework and an aesthetic, expressed\nthrough a disproportionate number of pamphlets and guides, all printed in an\nepigrammatic style that might suit a fortune-teller\u2019s card table. \u201cI remember\nthat this protocol was a little off-putting at first\u2014like, are you serious\nwith all this oldy-worldy hear-ye typeface?\u201d Gabriel P\u00e9rez-Barreiro, a\ncurator, told me. \u201cBut what I have observed in many years of attentional\npractice is that the more scaffolding you put in, the freer the experience\nbecomes.\u201d\n\nUnable to refrain entirely from academic habits, a subgroup of Birds have\nproduced their own outlandish body of work. Early in the last decade, Burnett\nand a couple of his colleagues began writing and assigning articles for an\nimaginary peer-reviewed journal devoted to scholarly study of the Birds. At\nfirst, the project was a way of sharing ideas about the Order\u2019s attention work\nwithout writing about it directly. (Like the Birds themselves, I was allowed\nto participate in actions on the condition that I not describe the experience\nin print. \u201cMy fear,\u201d one longtime Bird said archly, \u201cis that people will\nmistake the description of the thing for the thing.\u201d) But many enjoyed writing\nfor the imaginary journal of the so-called Esthetical Society for\nTranscendental and Applied Realization (now incorporating the Society of\nEsthetic Realizers)\u2014or ESTAR(SER)\u2014and some seem to have enjoyed it more than\ntheir real work. When Burnett and two co-editors culled a selection, in 2021,\nthey ended up with a book more than seven hundred and fifty pages long.\n\nLanding somewhere between \u201cPale Fire\u201d and the formal irony of Timothy\nMcSweeney\u2019s Quarterly Concern, the volume, called \u201cIn Search of the Third\nBird,\u201d is rendered in the voice of hapless researchers trying to chase down\nthe elusive Order. The articles are not pure fiction\u2014they include real\nattention scholarship\u2014but neither are they a hundred per cent objectively\ntrue. Counterfactual histories filter in, cross-referencing one another. Some\narticles are by real scholars, while others run under birdy pseudonyms (\u201cMolly\nGottstauk\u201d) with preposterous author biographies. Justin Smith-Ruiu, a writer\nand a professor at the Universit\u00e9 Paris Cit\u00e9 as well as an editor of \u201cIn\nSearch of the Third Bird,\u201d touted to me \u201cthe world-making dimension\u201d of it.\n\u201cOur idea was: Let\u2019s turn academic practice into an art form,\u201d Smith-Ruiu\nsaid.\n\nCartoon by Liana Finck\n\nLink copied\n\nEven many members of the Order describe the ESTAR(SER) work as a bit precious.\n\u201cThe amount of effort in the book is huge, but its effect is, uh, marginal,\u201d\nAdam Jasper said. \u201cIt sort of fits into the Birds\u2019 ethos of not being\nconcerned with inputs and outputs.\u201d In a sense, it is bizarre that\nESTAR(SER)\u2014an acronym that, being two forms of the Spanish \u201cto be,\u201d is largely\nun-Googleable\u2014has become the Order\u2019s public front, mounting lectures and\nexhibitions across the country. (Last year, it had an exhibition at the Frye\nArt Museum, in Seattle; this spring, it will present a show at the Opening\nGallery, in Tribeca.) But that improbability is the point. Catherine L.\nHansen, an assistant professor at the University of Tokyo and another editor\nof the book, describes the project as a defiantly playful performance of\nhumanities scholarship\u2019s twenty-first-century limits\u2014the way that disciplines\nare increasingly pressed to approach the work of human imagination with the\nobjective rigor of a science.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at the world, I feel that something is being lost or actively\nundermined,\u201d she told me. \u201cSometimes it feels like attention. Sometimes it\nfeels like imagination. Sometimes it feels like\u201d\u2014she thought for a\nmoment\u2014\u201cthat thing you wanted when you became an English major, that sort of\nhalf-dreamed, half-real thing you thought you were going to be. Whatever that\nis: it\u2019s under attack.\u201d\n\nOne recent afternoon, I visited an Apple Store to try the company\u2019s new\naugmented-reality goggles, called the Apple Vision Pro. I had seen YouTube\nvideos of people wandering around in the devices, interacting with invisible\nobjects and making obscene-looking grabby-squeezy gestures with their hands.\nWhen I put on the contraption, under the care of an employee, I found myself\ntrapped in a realm where my attention was at once more passive and more active\nthan it usually was. The details of the world within the goggles seemed\npremade for my inspection: I was moved from snowy Iceland to the edge of a\nlake near Mt. Hood. The landscape, quiet and perfect, with no other creatures\nin sight, revealed itself in measure with my gaze; scenery came and went by\nway of menus, which I called up with a button near my eyes. When I watched a\n3-D video clip of a girl blowing out the candles on a cake, my heart broke\nwith loneliness. I felt as if I were the last human being on Earth.\n\nOn the other hand, wherever my eyes moved, something happened. When I opened\nMicrosoft Word, a keyboard floated up. I was told to type using my eyes. I\ndid\u2014or, rather, D-i-d\u2014moving my gaze from letter to letter. For someone used\nto touch-typing while sometimes ranging his eyes around the room, this\nimmersion in the key-by-key process was a surreal way to write, like driving a\ncar from the camshaft.\n\nThe idea of following visual attention through the motion of the eyes goes\nback more than a century. In the eighteen-seventies, Louis \u00c9mile Javal, a\nFrench ophthalmologist with terrible glaucoma, began studying tiny eye\nmovements\u2014he called them \u201csaccades,\u201d for the jerking movements of horses under\nrein\u2014with an aim toward understanding how people read. In the middle of the\ntwentieth century, the Soviet psychologist Alfred Yarbus (n\u00e9 Kra\u0107kowski)\nsuctioned a contact lens to the surface of the eye and traced its path across\na painting. Yarbus was exploring what had long eluded science: the mysteries\nof people\u2019s attention to art. In his most famous experiment, involving Ilya\nRepin\u2019s \u201cThey Did Not Expect Him,\u201d a realist painting depicting a Russian\nrevolutionary returning to his family, viewers were asked to look at the\ncanvas both freely and in response to prompts, which changed the course of\ntheir attention. In the Soviet Union, the results of the experiment could be\ntaken to speak to the power of social education. In the West, the notion that\nthe eye\u2019s attention was suggestible had commercial weight. In recent decades,\nresearchers and advertisers have used updated versions of Yarbus\u2019s technique:\ninstead of employing a contact lens, they often track the eye with infrared\ntechnology, a method that also helps support the Vision Pro.\n\nBut people see what they are looking for. One theory of our attention crisis\nis that it\u2019s actually a measurement crisis, because the signals we are\nfocussed on define our understanding of the field. If \u201cattention\u201d entails a\nbattle for our immediate gaze, then that gaze becomes the valuable commodity,\nmore than a slow-accruing mental simmer.\n\n\u201cYou have this idea of attention as an object that is traded between people,\nso all of your science goes into measuring this object,\u201d Mike Follett, the\nmanaging director of Lumen Research, which claims to hold the largest eye-\ntracking data set in the world, told me. In the past decade, more than half a\nmillion people have participated in Lumen\u2019s studies (for which they have been\npaid); the company supplies much of the raw attention data used in Dentsu\u2019s\nmodels. At first, Lumen mailed out infrared kits to track eye movements, but\nthe process was tricky. So the company created an app that uses smartphone\ncameras to measure glints of light off the eyes. \u201cNow we can get a thousand\npeople to do a research project in an afternoon,\u201d Follett said. \u201cWe\u2019ll observe\nnot only how many people looked at ads or for how long but how many people\nclicked on the ads and, if they did click, whether anyone bought things.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, Follett said, our minds are not merely our eyes. \u201cEye tracking is not\nattention, in a number of important ways,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou can look without\nseeing\u2014and you can see without looking.\u201d\n\nOther body language signals attention of different kinds. People watch TV\nscreens with a posture distinct from the one they use for looking at their\nphones or laptops. They read a Times article in a different position than they\nsearch for flights to Paris in. The more types of data one admits into the\nscience, the more surprising and enigmatic the picture of human attention\nbecomes. By many measures, Follett said, one of the very worst advertising\nenvironments is social media: \u201cPeople are scrolling so tremendously quickly,\nlike on a slot machine in Vegas\u2014is it any wonder no one actually looks at\nthese ads?\u201d One of the most valuable advertising spaces, according to his\ndata, is next to long, absorbing articles from trusted publications.\n\n\u201cIt turns out that attention to advertising is a function of attention to\ncontent,\u201d he explained. A general schlock-ification of material may have\nhelped create a mirage of shortening attention. \u201cMaybe people do not have time\nto spend looking at a thirty-six-second ad\u2014or maybe they just don\u2019t do it on\nFacebook,\u201d he went on. \u201cSo Facebook responds by developing new advertising\nproducts meant to work in five or six seconds.\u201d The platforms, in this way,\nproduce their own ecology of scarceness. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s chicken or\negg,\u201d he said.\n\nFor most people, attention is not a point of visual focus but something nearer\nto a warm breeze through an open window, carrying fragrances from far away. We\nfeel its power when we read an absorbing novel. We find it when we visit a new\nplace and notice everything for the first time. To Maurice Merleau-Ponty, the\nmid-century phenomenologist, attention was the inconvenient truth of\nmodernity, the heart of why both empirical science and pure inner reason were\ndoomed to fall short of capturing the world as it truly was. Modernity prized\nobjective measurement and transmissible bodies of knowledge over experience,\nand yet, for millennia, experience was intimately tied to knowledge: our\nelders were our sages.\n\n\u201cObjectivity is a big success, but it scorches the earth of the experiential\nand makes it merely \u2018personal,\u2019 \u201d Burnett posited one day over a meal at the\nWatermill Center, in Southampton, New York, where a group of Birds have had a\ncouple of residencies through the support of the artist Robert Wilson. A small\ndining hall was crowded with them: Loh, Fox, and others. \u201cPhenomenology was\nsaying, Hey, why not go back to experience and not break it across the knee\ninto objectivity and subjectivity, leaving the subjective discarded as weak?\u201d\nBurnett said. \u201cCan we go back to the experiential and hold it close\u2014but make\nsomething that\u2019s real and true, not just an outpouring of emotions?\u201d\n\nThat afternoon, I walked around with Loh, who had discovered Birding on her\nown, before meeting Burnett. \u201cIt felt like everything I saw in life disclosed\nthe same thing, which was that the world was more interesting than the image\nof it in my head,\u201d she recalled. The Birds\u2019 injunctions against studium,\ninterpretation, and judgment seemed to her to apply to people, too. \u201cYou\u2019re\nnot supposed to use people, or to think that you understand what they\u2019re\nabout,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is the thing you do with a person that\u2019s adequate to\nthe thing they are? And my best pass at that is: attention. You attend to\nthem.\u201d\n\nFor some, the practice of people attending together makes up not only an\nethics but a politics. Kristin Lawler, a sociology professor at Mount St.\nVincent and the author of a scholarly monograph on surfing, was drawn to\nBirding for, as she put it, \u201cthe idea that people can create their own world\ntogether.\u201d She went on, \u201cThe flood of images that are coming toward us all the\ntime are destroying our subjectivity.\u201d It left individuals, especially young\nones, less room to decide for themselves what they were interested in.\nReclaiming attention, in that way, was an act of resistance.\n\nPeople of all stripes have tended to agree. In the new book \u201cThe Anxious\nGeneration,\u201d the sociologist and pundit Jonathan Haidt links smartphone\ntechnology to escalating teen depression and other ill effects. \u201cThe members\nof Gen Z are . . . test subjects for a radical new way of growing up, far from\nthe real-world interactions of small communities in which humans evolved,\u201d he\nwrites. \u201cIt\u2019s as if they became the first generation to grow up on Mars.\u201d\n\nSeeking a response, Lawler, Len Nalencz, and others have begun teaching\nthrough an institution that they helped form, the Strother School of Radical\nAttention. (It was named for Matthew Strother, a young Bird who died, last\nyear, of cancer.) The school, run by an organization called the Friends of\nAttention, holds workshops in New York public schools; for adults, it offers\nevening courses and free weekend \u201cAttention Labs.\u201d \u201cBecause one doesn\u2019t have\nto be a Bird to produce some of these same effects,\u201d Burnett said.\n\nI stopped on a Saturday afternoon at one of the Strother School\u2019s adult\nworkshops, at a community center on the Lower East Side. Around fifty people\nhad shown up. A lot were under thirty. \u201cYoung people, many of whom I admired,\nwere coming up to me and being, like, \u2018I need to be more productive,\u2019 \u201d the\nschool\u2019s founding program director, Peter Schmidt, a former student of\nBurnett\u2019s, told me. \u201cBut, once they\u2019re in the room, you can create the\nconditions where less tangible experiences emerge.\u201d\n\nWe sat in a big circle of chairs; daylight streamed through a set of floor-to-\nceiling windows.\n\n\u201cIn a moment, what I\u2019m going to do is invite you to choose some spot in this\nroom that you can focus your eyes on,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cThen I\u2019m going to invite\nyou, keeping your eyes fixed, to notice something at the edge of your vision.\u201d\n\nHe waited ten seconds while we did the exercise, then rang a bell.\n\n\u201cTo recap, you had your eyes fixed on some point, and then some other part of\nyou was moving throughout your field of vision,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question here\nis: What was that part of you? What moved?\u201d\n\nAttention, of course. Schmidt\u2019s exercise made a point of teasing out the\ndifference between a movement of the mind and a movement of the eye.\n\nFor the next two hours, there were other short practices to isolate and\ncultivate attention. A producer and d.j. called Troy (Bachtroy) Mitchell, who\nhad long locs and a lime-green fleece, played an experimental piece of his\nfour times, instructing the participants to listen in a different way with\neach repetition. Loh and a colleague took a group of people onto the balcony\nto study the cityscape: directly, in selfie mode, backward (in the black\nmirror of a switched-off phone), and with eyes closed. Then they gathered in a\nsmall circle, Bird style, to recount their experiences.\n\nNalencz told me about the school\u2019s origins. \u201cI met these great people in the\nBirds, but who were they? Academics, artists, mostly white,\u201d he said. And yet\nthe greatest victims of attention predation, he thought, were young people\nfrom under-resourced communities, who, like some of his students, were able to\naccess public culture mostly through their phones. \u201cI felt a double need to\ntry to get to students who I thought were really smart but (a) wouldn\u2019t show\nup at the Met because of class reasons and (b) only have phones, not books.\u201d\n\nOne of his students had been Jahony Germosen, a senior English major who was\nborn in the Dominican Republic and grew up in the Bronx. Although she\u2019d got\nA\u2019s in Nalencz\u2019s classes, her attendance was irregular. Nalencz challenged her\nto fix that\u2014and then to try something else.\n\n\u201cHe was, like, \u2018I\u2019m a part of this nonprofit organization. . . . I want you to\ncome,\u2019 \u201d Germosen said. She did, and the experience moved her.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to describe the feeling,\u201d she told me. \u201cSometimes the world\nmakes everything and everyone seem so replaceable, like they lack value. But\nthen you come here, and it\u2019s, like, no, everything matters. You matter. That\nbuilding matters.\u201d When she realized that the youngest facilitator at the\nStrother School was an ancient twenty-seven, she applied to join the staff.\nThat afternoon, it was Germosen who began to close out the workshop.\n\nNot all Birds have found comfort in the group\u2019s increasing public openness. \u201cI\nhaven\u2019t been active in a lot of years,\u201d Dorothea von Moltke, a co-owner of\nLabyrinth Books, in Princeton, New Jersey, told me. \u201cThe performance aspect of\nit was not ever where my interest was\u2014I loved the rogueness.\u201d At the edges of\nthe Order, though, a new vanguard is taking shape. \u201cWhat I feel is extremely\nimportant about these practices is that they are open, and people have\nabsolute liberty to reinvent and adapt them,\u201d someone who asked to be\nidentified only as Daphne, and who worked at a trans-community-support\norganization in Montreal, told me. \u201cThe way I practice with people in Montreal\nis very different from the way I practice when I\u2019m with the people who\nintroduced me to it.\u201d\n\nThe people with whom Daphne practices in Montreal are largely sex workers.\n\u201cThey have a relationship with the city that\u2019s engaged with the history of the\nviolent eradication of sex workers in the red-light district,\u201d she said. One\nof the actions centered on the fa\u00e7ade of a defunct strip club. A few weeks\nlater, the club burned down, in what she believes was arson: one more piece of\nthat world eradicated. Their attention, Daphne felt, had meant something. \u201cIt\nwould have been very different if I\u2019d gathered with that same group of people\nand attended to, like, a Donald Judd,\u201d she said.\n\nOne rainy afternoon, I watched an action that a New York Bird had called at\nthe New Museum. When the first bell rang, four Birds emerged from the crowd to\nsettle into the phalanx before \u201cThe Giantess (The Guardian of the Egg),\u201d by\nLeonora Carrington\u2014a surreal painting of a woman being swarmed by birds. The\ngroup, two timorous young men and two women in rain parkas, looked\nnonthreatening, but, by the time the Realizing bell sounded, guards were on\nalert, peering around dividing walls and texting. Visitors rubbernecked, as if\nentranced by\u2014what? Reactions of that sort are standard.\n\n\u201cThey say registering online should take ten minutes to two days, depending on\nmy computer skills.\u201d\n\nCartoon by Frank Cotham\n\nLink copied\n\n\u201cYou quickly find that even museums, places supposedly devoted to art, aren\u2019t\nset up for people doing more than the standard fifteen seconds per painting,\u201d\nBurnett said. Recent art vandalisms have led to tightened security, but there\nhas always been pressure. (Among New York vol\u00e9es, the Guggenheim is considered\nthe most laissez-faire.) In 2014, Nalencz initiated an action on a mural, by\nJulie Mehretu, in the lobby of the Goldman Sachs building in lower Manhattan\u2014a\npiece that the company touted as being on public display, visible to passersby\nthrough the lobby\u2019s large windows. As soon as Birds began to gather on the\nsidewalk, security told them to leave. Under Nalencz\u2019s instruction, they went\non to attend to the mural through the windows. Police came.\n\n\u201cTell me where the public sidewalk is,\u201d Nalencz said to the officers. \u201cWe\u2019re\njust looking at the art work.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut nobody\u2019s looking,\u201d a guard pointed out. True enough: the Negation phase\nhad begun. One Bird was studying the bushes. Another had seemingly gone to\nsleep.\n\n\u201cThis is a performance,\u201d an officer averred. \u201cYou got a permit?\u201d\n\nNalencz looked at the officer, at the other Birds, and back at the officer. He\nleaned in confidentially. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not much of a performance, is it?\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nThe structure that I learned from Knauss\u2014Encounter, Attending, Negation,\nRealizing\u2014is what\u2019s known, within the Order, as the Standard Protocol. Many\nvariations have been devised. There is the Vetiver Protocol, for attendance to\nfragrances. There is the Protocol of the Sea Watch, to be done in water. (Its\nfinal step: \u201cResurface; lose your gills.\u201d) Some inventions are soon forgotten,\nbut the most successful endure. While meeting up with Birds in Shanghai and\nBeirut, two places where participants in public, semi-performative gatherings\ncould face real risk, Burnett helped develop a walk-by form of action, called\nthe Doppler Protocol: Attending happens on the approach to the work; Negation\nis the instant of reaching it; and Realization happens over the shoulder,\nwhile walking away. \u201cWe call it an Orphic Realization, \u00e0 la Orpheus,\u201d Burnett\nsaid. Back in New York, he tried it on the statue of Christopher Columbus in\nColumbus Circle, with the Birds attending as they walked up Eighth Avenue.\n\nOne of the most affecting protocols is the Prosphorion, performed on an object\nof great importance that has become inaccessible. In the protocol, one of the\nparticipants \u201cbecomes\u201d that object. Nalencz once became \u201cTilted Arc,\u201d the\nRichard Serra sculpture installed in Foley Square and removed, in 1989, after\ncontroversy. Again, he was accosted by a guard. \u201cI\u2019m the sculpture!\u201d he cried,\nand stood unyieldingly, in a \u201cTilted Arc\u201d sort of way. (The guard said, in a\ndowntown sort of way, \u201cOh, O.K.,\u201d and moved on.)\n\nI was never able to see the Prosphorion. But a number of Birds told me that\nthe protocol carried unexpected emotional weight. In the final phase, the\nabsent object \u201cattends to you.\u201d \u201cPeople cry, or go into trance states,\u201d\nCatherine Hansen said. \u201cIt is very difficult not to think of things that you\nhave lost or are missing.\u201d Caitlin Sweeney, the director of digital\npublications for the Wildenstein Plattner Institute, which produces catalogues\nraisonn\u00e9s, was so moved by the \u201cTilted Arc\u201d action that she passed along a\nwritten account of it to a friend who worked for Serra. To her surprise, she\nreceived an enthusiastic response from Serra\u2019s wife, and the account was added\nto the studio\u2019s dossier for the sculpture, making the Birds\u2019 art of attention\npart of the artist\u2019s record of his most notorious piece.\n\nSuch evidence of the Order\u2019s reach made me wonder more about its origins.\nSweeney wasn\u2019t sure where the Birds came from. Adam Jasper told me, \u201cYou see\nthings that make you suspect that this has been going on for a long time, but\nI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve virtually accused Graham Burnett of inventing the\npractice.\u201d Burnett said, \u201cI\u2019ve always thought it\u2019s somehow French.\u201d I went to\nlook through an archive of unpublished writeups of Bird actions, which, for\narcane reasons, was housed in a large travelling trunk in a corner of the\noffice of Cody Upton, the executive director of the American Academy of Arts\nand Letters. Poring over the documents, I noticed that there were no records\nof actions before 2010. I talked to Hansen. \u201cI would recommend that you speak\nto Jeff Dolven and Sal Randolph,\u201d she said at last. \u201cThese are people who most\nlikely witnessed the big bang.\u201d\n\nDolven, when I asked, laughed. \u201cWhen I started practicing, I was not\nparticularly aware of other Birdish activity,\u201d he said opaquely. \u201cIt was me\nand Graham and Sal Randolph. . . .\u201d He drifted off. \u201cHave you talked to Sal?\u201d\n\nRandolph, an artist and a writer who published a book called \u201cThe Uses of\nArt,\u201d arranged to meet me at a large Think Coffee in Manhattan. Her hair was\ncropped short and dyed a deep blue. She told me she\u2019d grown interested in\nattention in the late nineties, while making art in Provincetown. \u201cYou spend\nall winter making a body of work, which you then show for two weeks in the\nsummer,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople were doing this very familiar-looking dance: I\napproach the work of art, I tilt my head a little bit, I give a little nod,\nand I step away to the next piece. It lasts two or three seconds.\u201d For months\nof painting, the response seemed preposterously meagre. \u201cI had this sense that\nart, poetry, cultural work is being wasted at a phenomenal rate.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, Randolph met Burnett on a panel. He worked with Dolven, and the three\nof them started talking. \u201cWe began to think of art works in need of attention\nthat they don\u2019t receive,\u201d she said. I told her I\u2019d found no direct record of\nOrder activity before then. Did that align with her understanding of its\norigins? She was silent. \u201cIt aligns with my sense of when a group of people\ngot to know each other,\u201d she offered at last, then met my gaze squarely. \u201cBut\nthis is really old.\u201d\n\nOn one of my last visits with Burnett, I found him in a bubbly mood. A Bird\naction would take place that evening\u2014\u201ca full-on, paramedics-of-attention\nsituation,\u201d he explained. The work, a public sculpture by Peter Lundberg, was\nencircled by a ramp of the George Washington Bridge, not far away. The Birds\nhad had it in their sights for years. Car passengers might catch a glimpse of\nit from the side as they sped past, but there was no way to see it from a\nstable position. Then, last year, the Port Authority reopened the George\nWashington Bridge\u2019s long-dormant north walk, making the piece newly visible to\npedestrians.\n\nI arrived on site early. On the approach, I passed Brad Fox sitting on a bus-\nstop bench in a navy raincoat; in the Birdish way, he registered no\nrecognition. The walkway was lined on each side by a chain-link fence and a\ngreen rail. Cyclists sliced around the curves. On rough ground, near a utility\ntruck, lay an elegant steel-and-concrete sculpture, as if someone had set it\ndown in the course of a journey and forgot to pick it up again. I noticed a\nfamiliar figure loping up the walkway: Burnett, with a gray hoodie pulled over\nhis head.\n\nA minute later, Nalencz followed, wearing a black jacket and a sports cap that\nsaid \u201cPILSNER.\u201d I saw Loh, then Fox, then Kristin Lawler. The group eventually\nfell into the phalanx at the north arc of the walkway. A gray-haired man\njoined them for a moment, trying to see what they were seeing. When the bell\nchimed for Negation, the Birds moved out of formation. Burnett studied a\ndrainage grate. Fox found a quiet place to lie down.\n\nA wind rose all at once. The waters of the Hudson darkened to a moody gray.\nThe walkway traced a horseshoe shape around the sculpture, and, on an impulse,\nNalencz called Realizing while leading the group to a position on the other\nside of the curve. They made a new phalanx, facing the opposite direction:\nfive people giving everything to an art work hidden for years. Could it have\nbeen my own imagination that the steel flanks of the sculpture seemed to flash\nwith new importance under the force of their attention?\n\nIt was sunset now; the skyline of New Jersey carried a thin wire of gold. I\nwatched the group wield their strange power on the art work, and it was one of\nthe most real things I have ever seen. \u2666\n\nPublished in the print edition of the May 6, 2024, issue.\n\n## New Yorker Favorites\n\n  * A Harvard undergrad took her roommate\u2019s life, then her own.
