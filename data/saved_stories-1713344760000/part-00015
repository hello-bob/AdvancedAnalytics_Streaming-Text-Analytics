All these\nregistrars have to compete with each other on price, customer service, and\nbrand recognition. Given the stiff competition, I would say that fees that\nregistrars charge are determined by the market. If a registrar could meet\nICANN's requirements and offer domain names for significantly less, then one\nwould do so.\n\nAs Matt Nordhoff points out, the registry itself also gets a substantial share\nof the money you pay for a domain name. For example when you register a $10\n.com domain, the fee is split:\n\n  * ICANN: $0.18\n  * Verisign, Inc. -- the .com registry: $7.85\n  * 3% credit card processing fee: $0.30\n  * Your registrar: $1.67\n\nHigh prices charged by registries are likely because of lack of competition.\nThere have only been a handful of registries, and of those, the .com registry\nhas been the most popular by far. In the last year ICANN has created many new\ntop level domains run by different companies. They have done so partly in the\nhope that it will increase competition and drive down prices. It is unclear at\nthis point whether that will work. The costs that new registries must pay to\nICANN to apply are very steep.

You may ask how did that happened when US supposed to so despise\nmonopolies?\n\nHere's how:\n\nEarly on registries were free, funded by government and run by InterNIC. Then\nthe government decided to privatize it. The contract to manage .com registry\nwas granted to a company called Network Solutions, Inc (NSI). At that time the\nUS Government actually paid $5.9M to NSI to do administration but then NSI\nmanaged to convince them that people should be charged to cover the cost\ninstead. Eventually Verisign bought Network Solutions and become the entity\nwhich manages the .com registry.\n\nEveryone was starting to realize that NSI/Verisign was becoming a monopoly for\nan important part of the modern economy. ICANN was formed in 1998 and\nchartered to introduce competition in this area. But instead they ended up\ndoing almost exactly the opposite in the next series of events.\n\nEarly in 2003 Verisign introduced a service called Site Finder which\nredirected users to a search engine if the domain didn't exist. ICANN said\nthis was \"overstepping the contract terms\". Verisign shutdown the service but\nalso sued ICANN for not being allowed to bring any improvements. Eventually\nICANN had to settle with Verisign and the prize of the settlement was that\nVerisign would be awarded contract renewal without any bidding plus the right\nto raise prices without showing cost justifications. There were even terms\nthat indicated Verisign can continue its monopoly for the long term. If you\nask me this is blunder and incompetence by ICANN at mega scale.\n\nIndustry was furious. Lot of people commented on ICANN's proposal of\nsettlement by saying that .com registry is not the property that ICANN owns to\nleverage in settlements. Others said no other government agency knowingly\nconsented to unchecked price increase without cost justification. But it was\nall in vain and ICANN directors voted 9-5 in favor of settlement.\n\n> \u201cWe are bitterly disappointed, but we\u2019re not giving up yet. It\u2019s simply a\n> bad deal for the industry and registrants everywhere,\u201d - Bob Parsons, CEO\n> and Founder of GoDaddy.com.\n\nDue to industry outrage, the US Department of Commerce had to intervene and\neliminate the clause for Verisign's right to increase prices by 7%. You can\nsay that Verisign showed benevolence for not increasing prices to what was\nalready considered ridiculous.\n\nIn cases like this, typically competitors bring antitrust lawsuits. It\nhappened against Verisign in 2010 but they escaped without a bruise because\nthe organization CFIT which had filed this case wasn't considered a competitor\nor financially injured. It also surprises me that real competitors haven't\ncome forward against Verisign to bring a large scale antitrust suit.\n\nSo when you pay that $10, it's ICANN's massive blunders of the last decade to\nallow Verisign to continue their absolute monopoly. Verisign has benefitted\ndearly with this. They have $2 billion in cash and $1 billion of yearly\nrevenues from all the payments you hand out to them. Verisign's financials\nindicate that this is their highest margin business.\n\nOne light at the end of the tunnel is that US government has announced plan to\nrelinquish the control of Internet which means ICANN might not have authority\nto hand out monopolies any longer. Their stock took big hit when US government\nannounced this.\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nedited Nov 27, 2021 at 21:01\n\nMike Ciffone\n\n6,36055 silver badges3737 bronze badges\n\nanswered May 8, 2014 at 7:55\n\nShital ShahShital Shah\n\n1,43911 gold badge99 silver badges66 bronze badges\n\n10\n\n  * 8\n\nWhen I registered my first domain in 1996 with Internic, it cost $35 per year.\nFor which I had to physically mail in a check.\n\n\u2013 Michael Hampton\n\nMay 9, 2014 at 19:40\n\n  * 2\n\nAre there any \"rules\" preventing private entities from starting their own\nnamespace on a massively large, public scale?

There is also the\nregistry, the organization contracted by ICANN to operate the TLD in question.\nThe bulk of the revenue is actually going to them. The .biz, .info and .org\nregistries, for example, all charge over $8. Verisign, who operates several\nmajor TLDs, was famously forced to stop increasing .com prices in 2012,\nleaving them at $7.85. They're still allowed to raise prices of their other\nTLDs, though: .net was raised to $5.62 last year, and .name to $6.60.\n\nOn the other hand, I suspect the story is different for all those new $50-100\ndomains. The registries charge a lot of money, and the registrars probably\nmark them up, too.

So for example, to\nresolve www.google.com, \".\" which is run by ICANN is asked who \"com\" is. It\nsays that \"com\" is Verisign, so then Verisign's \"com\" server is asked who is\n\"google\" and verisign says, \"Google Inc\" and then Google Inc's server is asked\nwho is \"www\" and it responds by giving out an IP address for a server that\nGoogle's homepage is running on.\n\n\u2013 AJ Henderson\n\nMay 9, 2014 at 14:59\n\n  * 2\n\nYou could subvert that entirely with if you controlled the root though.

However it should be noted that this cap does not include already\npurchased domains that you often see at auction for thousands of dollars.on.\n\nNewer gTLD's domains such as .club, .sexy and .security have no ICANN\nlimitations on how much a wholesaler can charge, this also applies to two\nletter country domains such as .us and .ca.\n\nWhom are these Domain Wholesalers?\n\nWholesalers is just another term for domain registry, the registry is not to\nbe confused with a registrar, for example Nominet is for registry for ccTLD\ndomains in the UK. Nominet does not sell domains directly to customers, they\nare sold through registrars, it is Nominet who set the cost of the domain\nunder the agreement with domain regulator.\n\nVeriSign is the registry for .com and are limited by ICANN how much they can\ncharge, but they have many other top level domains that may not have the same\nagreement.\n\nWhere does my money go?\n\n  1.

As explains in other replies, ICANN does\nnot have an operational day to day role in domain name operations. When you\nbuy a domain name, you exercise various services at registrars and registries,\nbut ICANN does nothing there, it just have a \"financial\" role and as\nregulator, accredits companies, etc.\n\nWhen speaking about keys, I think you are referencing articles such as\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/28/seven-people-keys-\nworldwide-internet-security-web and many others. They are mostly very\nsensational, including in their title, for no reason except selling papers.\n\nThey are trying to explain complicated technical concepts (around DNSSEC, see\nbelow) but do so in so many gross over simplifications that the end result is\ncompletely meaningless.\n\nSince it is not the core of your question, let us here just try to summarize\nthe issue:\n\n  * to secure DNS resolution, a new protocol (an extension in fact) was invented, which is called DNSSEC\n  * DNSSEC uses cryptographic keys (the same kind of the ones used for certificates when you browse HTTPS websites, etc.) to authenticate DNS answers so that a resolver can detect if there is an attack on a domain name\n  * DNSSEC works with a chain of trust, exactly like in the HTTPS world with CAs; this means that each level of the DNS tree has a set of keys\n  * so that extends to the root (.) which is the mother or father of everything, starting with TLDs\n  * the root of the DNS tree has keys that needs to be changed twice per year; this is a policy issue, not a technical one; it is a compromise dictated by the wish to both change cryptographic materials to reduce the window of opportunities for attackers, and also to have \"ceremonies\" frequent enough so that people are well-trained for them, including if/when it will be needed to conduct them in an emergency\n  * the ceremony taking place twice per year to change these keys involves many people and many processes, with a lot of auditing\n  * to make it short, no the Internet is not at the mercy of 7 people that could do anything they want and disrupt things. Each one by themselves have basically no power at all.
