The two\npublishing houses made up 37 percent and 11 percent of the market share,\naccording to the filing, and combined they would have condensed the Big Five\npublishing houses into the Big Four. But the government intervened and brought\nan antitrust case against Penguin to determine whether that would create a\nmonopoly.\n\nThe judge ultimately ruled that the merger would create a monopoly and blocked\nthe $2.2 billion purchase. But during the trial, the head of every major\npublishing house and literary agency got up on the stand to speak about the\npublishing industry and give numbers, giving us an eye-opening account of the\nindustry from the inside. All of the transcripts from the trial were compiled\ninto a book called The Trial. It took me a year to read, but I\u2019ve finally\nsummarized my findings and pulled out all the compelling highlights.\n\nI think I can sum up what I\u2019ve learned like this: The Big Five publishing\nhouses spend most of their money on book advances for big celebrities like\nBrittany Spears and franchise authors like James Patterson and this is the\nbulk of their business. They also sell a lot of Bibles, repeat best sellers\nlike Lord of the Rings, and children\u2019s books like The Very Hungry Caterpillar.\nThese two market categories (celebrity books and repeat bestsellers from the\nbacklist) make up the entirety of the publishing industry and even fund their\nvanity project: publishing all the rest of the books we think about when we\nthink about book publishing (which make no money at all and typically sell\nless than 1,000 copies).\n\nBut let\u2019s dig into everything they said in detail.\n\nDid you know that 96% of books sell less than 1,000 copies? That\u2019s why I write\nhere instead \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\n\n##\n\nBestsellers are rare\n\nIn my essay \u201cWriting books isn\u2019t a good idea\u201d I wrote that, in 2020, only 268\ntitles sold more than 100,000 copies, and 96 percent of books sold less than\n1,000 copies. That\u2019s still the vibe.\n\n> Q. Do you know approximately how many authors there are across the industry\n> with 500,000 units or more during this four-year period?\n>\n> A. My understanding is that it was about 50.\n>\n> Q. 50 authors across the publishing industry who during this four-year\n> period sold more than 500,000 units in a single year?\n>\n> A. Yes.\n>\n> \u2014\n>\n> Madeline Mcintosh\n>\n> , CEO, Penguin Random House US\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s lawyer collected data on 58,000 titles published in a year and\ndiscovered that 90 percent of them sold fewer than 2,000 copies and 50 percent\nsold less than a dozen copies.\n\nIn my essay \u201cNo one will read your book,\u201d I said that publishing houses work\nmore like venture capitalists. They invest small sums in lots of books in\nhopes that one of them breaks out and becomes a unicorn, making enough money\nto fund all the rest.\n\nTurns out, they agree!\n\n> Every year, in thousands of ideas and dreams, only a few make it to the top.\n> So I call it the Silicon Valley of media. We are angel investors of our\n> authors and their dreams, their stories. That\u2019s how I call my editors and\n> publishers: angels... It\u2019s rather this idea of Silicon Valley, you see 35\n> percent are profitable; 50 on a contribution basis. So every book has that\n> same likelihood of succeeding.\n>\n> \u2014 Markus Dohle, CEO, Penguin Random House\n\nThose unicorns happen every five to 10 years or so.\n\n> We\u2019re very hit driven. When a book is successful, it can be wildly\n> successful. There are books that sell millions and millions of copies, and\n> those are financial gushes for the publishers of that book, sometimes for\n> years to come... A gusher is once in a decade or something. For instance, I\n> don\u2019t know if you know the Twilight series of books? Hachette published the\n> Twilight series of books, and those made hundreds of millions of dollars\n> over the course of time.\n>\n> Right now the novels of Colleen Hoover are topping the bestseller lists in\n> really, really huge numbers and the publishers of those books are making a\n> lot of money. You probably remember The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo... Or\n> the Fifty Shades of Grey series. So once every five years, ten years, those\n> come along for the whole industry and become the industry driver that\u2019s\n> drawing people into bookstores because there is such a commotion about them.\n>\n> \u2014 Michael Pietsch, CEO, Hachette\n\n##\n\nBig advances go to celebrities\n\nThey spent a lot of the trial talking about books that made an advance of more\nthan $250,000\u2014they called these \u201canticipated top-sellers.\u201d According to\nNicholas Hill, a partner at Bates White Economic Consulting, 2 percent of all\ntitles earn an advance over $250,000.\n\nPublisher\u2019s Marketplace says it\u2019s even lower.\n\n> Top-selling authors were defined as those receiving advances (i.e.,\n> guaranteed money) in excess of $250,000. Far fewer than 1 percent of authors\n> receive advances over that mark; Publishers Marketplace, which tracks these\n> things, recorded 233 such deals in all of 2022.\n>\n> \u2014\n>\n> ken whyte\n>\n> , Publisher at Sutherland House\n\nHill says titles that earn advances over $250,000 account for 70 percent of\nadvance spending by publishing houses. At Penguin Random House, it\u2019s even\nmore. The bulk of their advance spending goes to deals worth $1 million or\nmore, and there are about 200 of those deals a year. Of the roughly $370\nmillion they say PRH accounts for, $200 million of that goes to advance deals\nworth $1 million or more.\n\nThis chart shows that as advances go up, more of them come from Penguin Random\nHouse which has the deepest pockets.\n\nMost of those are deals with celebrities. And Penguin gets most of them.\n\nBooks by the Obamas sold so many copies they had to be removed from the charts\nas statistical anomalies.\n\n> There are giant celebrities Michelle Obama where you know it\u2019s going to be a\n> top seller.\n>\n> \u2014 Jennifer Rudolph Walsch, Literary Agent\n\nBecause they are so lucrative, Gallery Books Group focuses its efforts on\ntrying to get celebrities to write books.\n\n> 75 percent [of our] acquisitions come from approaching celebrities,\n> politicians, athletes, the \u201ccelebrity adjacent,\u201d etc. That way, we can\n> control the content.... We are approaching authors and celebrities and\n> politicians and athletes for ideas. So it\u2019s really we are on the look out.\n> We are scouts in a lot of ways...\n>\n> \u2014 Jennifer Bergstrom, SVP, Gallery Books Group\n\nBergstrom said her biggest celebrity sale was Amy Schumer who received\nmillions of dollars for her advance.\n\n> We\u2019ve had a lot of success publishing musicians, I mentioned Bruce\n> Springsteen. We\u2019ve also published Bob Dylan and Linda Ronstadt, a lot of\n> entertainers through the years... There was a political writer, Ben Shapiro,\n> who has a very popular podcast and a large following. We also competed with\n> HarperCollins for that.\n>\n> \u2014 Jonathan Karp, CEO, Simon & Schuster\n\nPenguin Random House US has guidelines for who gets what advance:\n\n  * Category 1: Lead titles with a sales goal of 75,000 units and up\n\n    * Advance: $500,000 and up\n\n  * Category 2: Titles with a sales goal of 25,000-75,000 units\n\n    * Advance: $150,000-$500,000\n\n  * Category 3: Titles with a sales goal of 10,000-25,000 units\n\n    * Advance: $50,000- $150,000\n\n  * Category 4: Titles with a sales goal of 5,000 to 10,000 units\n\n    * Advance: $50,000 or less\n\nIs anyone else alarmed that the top tier is book sales of 75,000 units and up?\nOne post on Substack could get more views than that.....\n\n##\n\nFranchise authors are the other big category\n\nFranchise authors are the other big category. Walsch says James Patterson and\nJohn Grisham get advances in the \u201cmany millions.\u201d Putnam makes most of its\nmoney from repeat authors like John Sandford, Clive Cussler, Tom Clancy, Lisa\nScottoline, and others.\n\n> Q. Putnam typically publihses about 60 books a year. Correct?\n>\n> A. 60, 65, sort of on naverage...

And if that platform is there for the\n> advertising, then the spend might be lower.\n>\n> \u2014 Jennifer Rudolph Walsh, former Agent\n\nMacmillan agrees.\n\n> Q. Would you agree that those type of authors, meaning the ones with the\n> built-in audience, are also authors who would command a high advance if they\n> went to a traditional publisher like Macmillan or PRH?\n>\n> A. That\u2019s a broad brush. But, yes...\n>\n> Q. And you\u2019re willing to pay more if they have a significant following?\n>\n> A. Yes.\n>\n> \u2014 Donald Weisberg, CEO, Macmillan Publishers\n\nThey give some examples:\n\n> The Butcher and the Wren... this particular author has a big following, and\n> with a single post on Instagram, she presold over 40,000 books.

So they actually are able\u2014we are\n> able to offload a good amount of the work, not all the time, but that is\n> actually a factor in why we sometimes pay these big advances, because the\n> authors are actually capable of helping us a lot.\n>\n> \u2014 Jonathan Karp, CEO, Simon & Schuster\n\nFor example:\n\n> Q. Who is the best selling Simon & Schuster author currently? A. Right now\n> it\u2019s Colleen Hoover. Q. Does she have the highest marketing budget that\n> Simon & Schuster pays? A. No. Q.

Penguin Random House has hired data scientists to try and figure out\n> these algorithms so that its books get better presented on Amazon than its\n> competitors\u2019 books?\n>\n> A. One of the many efforts that we pursue, correct.\n>\n> Q. And Penguin Random House pays Amazon to improve its search results?\n>\n> A.

The singer Justin Timberlake sold only 100,000 copies in\nthe three years after he published his book. Snoop Dog\u2019s cookbook saw a boost\nduring the pandemic, but he still only sold 205,000 copies in 2020.\n\nHere\u2019s a few more:\n\n> Representative Ilhan Omar, a Democrat from Minnesota, is no global pop star,\n> but she has a significant social-media presence, with 3 million Twitter\n> followers and another 1.3 million on Instagram.

Well, because books don\u2019t sell a lot of copies, they don\u2019t make a\nlot of money. According to Hill, 85 percent of the books with advances of\n$250,000 and up never earn out their advance. (Meaning the royalties earned\nnever covered the cost of the advance.)\n\n> Very, very frequently, the winning bid in our calculation is a money loser.\n>\n> \u2014 Michael Pietsch, CEO, Hachette\n\nA chart from Penguin\n\nMarkus Dohle, CEO, Penguin Random House, says the top 4 percent of titles\ndrive 60 percent of the profitability. That goes for the rest of them too:\n\n> It would be just a couple of books in every hundred are driving that degree\n> of profit... twoish books account for the lion\u2019s share of profitability.\n>\n> \u2014 Madeline Mcintosh, CEO, Penguin Random House US\n\n> Around half the books we publish make a profit of some kind.\n>\n> \u2014 Michael Pietsch, CEO, Hachette\n\n> About half of the books we publish make money, and a much lower percentage\n> of them earn back the advance we pay.\n>\n> \u2014 Jonathan Karp, CEO, Simon & Schuster\n\nMany publishers have realized that maybe those big advances aren\u2019t worth it.\n\n> We have a report that we colloquially call \u2018The Ones That Got Away.\u2019 And\n> it\u2019s a report on the books where we bid $500,000 or more as an advance and\n> did not succeed in acquiring the book... this report stands as a kind of\n> caution against the high risk of big advances because the lesson we take\n> away again and again is: Thank goodness we stopped bidding when we did\n> because even at the advance we offered, we would have lost money... Very\n> frequently, the winning bid in our calculation is a money loser.\n>\n> \u2014 Michael Pietsch, CEO, Hachette\n\n##\n\nIt\u2019s all about the backlist\n\nIf new books typically don\u2019t sell well, well that\u2019s why publishing houses make\ntheir revenue from their backlist.\n\n> I would actually expect a book that is selling 300,000 units in a year is\n> probably going to sell at least 400,000 or 500,000 over its life once you\n> get backlist in there too.\n>\n> Our backlist brings in about a third of our annual revenues, so $300 million\n> a year roughly, a little less.\n>\n> \u2014 Michael Pietsch, CEO, Hachette\n\nThe backlist includes all of the books that have ever come out. Brian Murray,\nCEO of HarperCollins, points out that their backlist includes bibles (an $80\nmillion business), coloring books, dictionaries, encyclopedias, magic trick\nbooks, calendars, puzzles, and SAT study guides. It also includes perennial\nbestsellers like Don Quijote, Steven King\u2019s Carrie, and Tolkien\u2019s Lord of the\nRings\u2014these books continue to sell year after year.\n\nPopular children\u2019s books are cash cows selling huge amounts of copies year\nafter year and generation after generation.\n\n> Sometimes children\u2019s books will be three generations, people have been\n> buying them over and over again, and so that backlist catalog is really,\n> really important to pay for the overhead of your publishing teams and then\n> also to take the risks on the new books. So without a backlist I think it\u2019s\n> very hard to compete with these big books.\n>\n> \u2014 Brian Murray, CEO, HarperCollins\n\nFor instance, Penguin Random House owns Eric Carle\u2019s Very Hungry Caterpillar\nintellectual property. The book has been on Publisher Weekly\u2019s bestseller list\nevery week for 19 years.\n\n> Children\u2019s books comprised 27 percent of PRH\u2019s sales in 2021. That\u2019s about\n> $725 million\u2014so roughly double the size of Scholastic\u2019s trade division, and\n> more or less equal on its own to all of Macmillan or HBG. Christian books\n> accounted for 2 percent.\n>\n> \u2014The Trial\n\nBacklist titles like The Bible and Very Hungry Caterpillar and Lord of the\nRings make up a disproportionately large percentage of the publishing\nindustry.\n\n##\n\nAmazon is the biggest threat to the industry\n\n> Q. Are you concerned that Amazon will favor Penguin Random House Simon &\n> Schuster in terms of promotion and distribution and discoverability?\n>\n> A. Yes.\n>\n> \u2014 Donald Weisberg, CEO, Macmillan Publishers\n\nWith Amazon\u2019s data, they could immediately beat out all the publishing houses\nif they wanted to.\n\n> I think Amazon as a publisher of books is underestimated. They have about 50\n> editors... Obviously, given the number of people searching on Amazon for\n> products, that gives them a huge advantage because when people go onto\n> Amazon, they\u2014if the book isn\u2019t there for what they are searching for, they\n> could create that book. That\u2019s one theory I have. But even if that doesn\u2019t\n> happen, they know what people are buying and they have access to that data.\n> Their bestseller list, in my view, is more important than The New York Times\n> best seller list because it\u2019s in realtime. It\u2019s hourly. And I look at that\n> Amazon best seller list regularly, every day.\n>\n> \u2014 Jonathan Karp, CEO, Simon & Schuster\n\n##\n\nA \u201cNetflix of Books\u201d would put publishing houses out of business\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be great if you could pay $9.99 a month and read all of the books\nyou want? Just like you get all the movies you want from Netflix? Or all the\nmusic you want from Spotify?\n\nTechnically, it does exist. Kindle Unlimited is the largest, followed by\nScribd. Audible isn\u2019t quite all-access, but then Spotify got into audiobooks\nand made them so. But none of these players have quite taken off the way\nNetflix or Spotify has. That\u2019s for one reason: The Big Five publishing houses\nrefuse to let their authors participate.\n\n> Q. No books are found on Kindle Unlimited? Because you think that\u2019ll be had\n> for the industry?\u201d\n>\n> A. We think it\u2019s going to destroy the publishing industry.\n>\n> \u2014 Markus Dohle, CEO, Penguin Publishing House\n\nHe\u2019s right. No one would purchase a book again.\n\n> We all know about Netflix, we all know about Spotify and other media\n> categories, and we also know what it has done to some industries... The\n> music industry has lost, in the digital transformation, approximately 50\n> percent of its overall revenue pool.\n>\n> \u2014 Markus Dohle, CEO, Penguin Publishing House\n\nThere\u2019s one reason.\n\n> Around 20 to 25 percent of the readers, the heavy readers, account for 80\n> percent of the revenue pool of the industry of what consumers spend on\n> books. It\u2019s the really dedicated readers. If they got all-access, the\n> revenue pool of the industry is going to be very small. Physical retail will\n> be gone\u2014see music\u2014within two to three years. And we will be dependent on a\n> few Silicon Valley or Swedish internet companies that will actually provide\n> all-access.\n>\n> \u2014 Markus Dohle, CEO, Penguin Publishing House\n\nThe publishing industry would die, that\u2019s for sure. But I\u2019d be willing to bet\nwriters would get their books read way more.\n\nAnd I think it\u2019s on its way. Spotify has already started publishing\naudiobooks, and my money is on Substack for eventually publishing written\nbooks!\n\n##\n\nAuthors are getting more independent\n\nIf publishing houses make minimal investment in marketing their authors and\nfocus largely on celebrity books and their backlist, authors who can\u2019t snag a\nlarge advance might have better luck building their own audience and\npublishing elsewhere.\n\n> I think really from the advent of online\u2014really, once the internet became\n> popular, you know, we heard the phrase disintermediation.

Unless you are a celebrity or franchise author,\nthe publishing model won\u2019t provide a whole lot more than a tiny advance and a\ndozen readers. If you are a celebrity, you\u2019ll still have a much bigger reach\non Instagram than you will with your book!\n\nPersonally, I could not be more grateful to skip the publishing houses\naltogether and write directly for my readers here, being supported by those\nwho read this newsletter rather than by a publishing advance that won\u2019t\nultimately translate to people reading my work.\n\nBut I\u2019d love to know your thoughts \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\n\nLeave a comment\n\nThank you for reading and being here,\n\nElle Griffin\n\nP.S.
