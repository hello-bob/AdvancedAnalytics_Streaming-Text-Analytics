We wanted to get a better sense of how the people thinking about these\nthreats every day perceive the risks.\n\nSo we decided to talk to more than a dozen biosecurity experts to better\nunderstand their views.\n\nTo make them feel comfortable speaking candidly, we granted the experts we\nspoke to anonymity. Sometimes disagreements in this space can get contentious,\nand certainly many of the experts we spoke to disagree with one another. We\ndon\u2019t endorse every position they\u2019ve articulated below.\n\nWe think, though, that it\u2019s helpful to lay out the range of expert opinions\nfrom people who we think are trustworthy and established in the field. We hope\nthis will inform our readers about ongoing debates and issues that are\nimportant to understand \u2014 and perhaps highlight areas of disagreement that\nneed more attention.\n\nThe group of experts includes policymakers serving in national governments,\ngrantmakers for foundations, and researchers in both academia and the private\nsector. Some of them identify as being part of the effective altruism\ncommunity, while others do not. All the experts are mid-career or at a more\nsenior level. Experts chose to provide their answers either in calls or in\nwritten form.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n  * 1 Expert 1: Failures of imagination and appeals to authority\n  * 2 Expert 2: Exaggerating small-scale risks and Western chauvinism\n  * 3 Expert 3: Useless reports and the world beyond effective altruism\n  * 4 Expert 4: Overconfidence in threat models\n  * 5 Expert 5: Interventions that don\u2019t address the largest threats\n  * 6 Expert 6: Over-reliance on past experience and overconfidence about the future\n  * 7 Expert 7: Resistance from governments and antagonising expert communities\n  * 8 Expert 8: Preparing for the \u201cBig One\u201d looks like preparing for the smaller ones\n  * 9 Expert 9: ChatGPT is not dangerous\n  * 10 Expert 10: The barriers to bioweapons are not that high\n  * 11 Expert 11: We don\u2019t need silver bullets\n  * 12 Expert 12: Three failure modes\n  * 13 Expert 13: Groupthink and failing to be scope sensitive\n  * 14 Expert 14: COVID-19 does not equal biological weapons\n  * 15 Learn more\n\n    * 15.1 Top recommendations\n    * 15.2 Further recommendations\n\nBelow, we highlight 14 responses from these experts about misconceptions and\nmistakes that they believe are common in the field of biosecurity,\nparticularly as it relates to people working on global catastrophic risks and\nin the effective altruism community.\n\nHere are some of the areas of disagreement that came up:\n\n  * What lessons should we learn from COVID-19?\n  * Is it better to focus on standard approaches to biosecurity or search for the highest-leverage interventions?\n  * Should we prioritise preparing for the most likely pandemics or the most destructive pandemics \u2014 and is there even a genuine trade-off between these priorities?\n  * How big a deal are \u201cinformation hazards\u201d in biosecurity?\n  * How should people most worried about global catastrophic risks engage with the rest of the biosecurity community?\n  * How big a threat are bioweapons?\n\nFor an overview of this area, you can read our problem profile on catastrophic\npandemics. (If you\u2019re not very familiar with biosecurity, that article may\nprovide helpful context for understanding the experts\u2019 opinions below.)\n\nHere\u2019s what the experts said.\n\n## Expert 1: Failures of imagination and appeals to authority\n\n> In discussions around biosecurity, I frequently encounter a failure of\n> imagination. Individuals, particularly those in synthetic biology and public\n> health sectors, tend to rely excessively on historical precedents, making it\n> difficult for them to conceive of novel biological risks or the potential\n> for bad actors within a range of fields. This narrow mindset hinders\n> proactive planning and compromises our ability to adequately prepare for\n> novel threats.\n>\n> Another frequent problem is appeal to authority. Many people tend to suspend\n> their own critical reasoning when a viewpoint is confidently presented by\n> someone they perceive as an authoritative figure. This can stymie deeper\n> reflections on pressing biosecurity issues and becomes especially\n> problematic when compounded by information cascades. In such scenarios, an\n> uncritically accepted idea from an authoritative source can perpetuate as\n> fact, sometimes going unquestioned for years.\n>\n> There are various appeals to tradition that frequently skews discussions in\n> broader biosecurity communities. For example, the adage that \u201cnature is the\n> worst bioterrorist\u201d has gained such widespread acceptance that it has become\n> a memetic obstacle to more nuanced understanding. We can be biassed in the\n> data we pay attention to, and in times of unprecedented technological\n> progress, we are at great risk of falling prey to our assumptions and\n> \u201cfighting the last war.\u201d\n>\n> For example, before the detonation of the first atomic bomb, the idea that a\n> single device could wreak destruction on an entire city was nearly\n> inconceivable based on prior warfare technologies. Previous estimates of\n> damage were based on conventional explosives and did not remotely\n> approximate the catastrophic impact of atomic bombs.\n>\n> The advent of nuclear technology led to a situation where traditional\n> calculations and historical precedents were starkly insufficient in\n> predicting the risks and outcomes. It would be wise to avoid the same errors\n> of reasoning when thinking about future risks from biology.\n\n## Expert 2: Exaggerating small-scale risks and Western chauvinism\n\n> There is a vast difference between a disease-causing agent or pathogen and\n> something that could actually create massive harm. That creates bad\n> policies, when people think that they\u2019re the same thing. It\u2019s technically\n> possible for someone to grow anthrax spores in their bathtub, but the amount\n> of damage they could do is constrained by the fact that anthrax typically\n> doesn\u2019t spread between people. So, focusing on the biological agents with\n> the largest capability for harm would probably mean prioritising risks\n> outside of anthrax.\n>\n> I also think there\u2019s a lot of chauvinism in biosecurity. This is less true\n> for those that work internationally, and more true for people who work in\n> the US. People always think well, of course Johns Hopkins University isn\u2019t\n> going to be part of a biological weapons programme. But that\u2019s not the\n> viewpoint of Russia and China and DPRK. Stop being so jingoistic. Stop\n> thinking Western governments are always well-meaning and non-Western\n> governments are not. The best way to view a US action is: what would you\n> think if you found out that China was researching the same thing?\n>\n> The other point about chauvinism is that the risks aren\u2019t the same in the\n> rich and the poor world. The rich world ignores the biosecurity of faecal-\n> oral diseases because we have good sanitation infrastructure. Conversely,\n> antibiotic resistance is top of mind for rich countries that use antibiotics\n> as the cornerstone of a biological response, but will not change the\n> consequences of an attack in a poor country that has limited stocks of\n> antibiotics.\n\n## Expert 3: Useless reports and the world beyond effective altruism\n\n> I think there\u2019s plenty of failure modes in terms of how people go about\n> trying to do good things in the world. Writing a report, sending it into the\n> void, and then expecting impact is a massive failure mode.\n>\n> Another failure mode is assuming that things that are high status or visible\n> within EA^1 are the most effective. A lot of the best work in biosecurity\n> comes from people that most EAs have just no idea exist, and those people\n> should be more of the role models that EAs have.\n\n## Expert 4: Overconfidence in threat models\n\n> I think some people, including senior people, are overconfident in their\n> threat models and have an overly simplistic view of certain issues. There\n> are also a lot of other people who are under-confident and deferential in a\n> way that I think is bad. So something to do with hierarchy and forming views\n> based on deference is probably a big misconception.\n>\n> Generally EA biosecurity has failed to really grapple with or seriously\n> weigh the benefits of things like gain-of-function research or pandemic\n> discovery. I think the analysis of these things can be quite simplistic and\n> people tend to form the bottom line first. I think most EAs think it is\n> probably bad to discover new pandemic viruses in nature without thinking too\n> much about it. I also think that\u2019s probably bad, but a lot of people could\n> benefit from more openness to being wrong.\n\n## Expert 5: Interventions that don\u2019t address the largest threats\n\n> I\u2019m generally just witheringly sceptical of incrementalist biosecurity\n> interventions like just hiring more doctors.\n>\n> In global catastrophic risk, obviously you do want to reduce risk in an\n> incremental way. But you do it by closing off particular parts of a threat\n> landscape.\n>\n> I tend to favour interventions that are supported by a story that says\n> something like, but for a given intervention, this particular threat would\n> have killed 10 billion or 8 billion \u2014 but instead it only kills less than a\n> billion, or something like that.\n>\n> COVID was some evidence in favour of my position being correct. The main\n> factor in saving lives was the vaccine. It\u2019s a very heavy-tailed\n> distribution in terms of actual impact. It\u2019s probably an archetypical EA\n> vibe to have, but it\u2019s one I am unapologetic in having.\n\n## Expert 6: Over-reliance on past experience and overconfidence about the\nfuture\n\n> There are two general categories of common failures in most policy efforts.\n> One is based on an over-reliance on past experience and the other is based\n> on a flawed sense of confidence about the future.\n>\n> For biosecurity and pandemic risk, we shouldn\u2019t overly rely on successful\n> interventions of the past in order to protect us against future biological\n> incidents \u2014 such as vaccination and other medical countermeasures. One of\n> the major successes during the COVID-19 pandemic was the rapid development\n> of vaccines. So it\u2019s easy to understand why folks would want to double down\n> on an approach that worked. In fact, it\u2019s an approach that has worked for\n> combatting and eradicating infectious diseases for many decades.\n>\n> However, medical countermeasures should not be the cornerstone of our\n> playbook moving forward, not least of all because we\u2019ve seen their\n> limitations in preventing disease transmission \u2014 plus anti-vaccine\n> sentiments.\n>\n> Plus, if we think that medical countermeasures are the answer to all of our\n> pandemic problems, we may be motivated to use AI or research automation to\n> design and develop medical countermeasures at any cost \u2014 even if the tools\n> and approaches we use could be misused.\n>\n> On the other hand, a future world where biology becomes increasingly\n> programmable is often imagined by those with confidence and optimism about\n> the future. But it\u2019s this same confidence in biology for good that prevents\n> visualisation of a world where biology can be misused by those with less\n> expertise and resources.\n>\n> These optimists are often the same ones that believe nothing robust should\n> be done to address dual-use risk because it will limit innovation and its\n> potential life-changing transformations. But it doesn\u2019t quite make sense how\n> innovations through AI and machine learning can be so life-changing for good\n> without commensurate potential to be life-changing for bad. We need to think\n> about minimising the risk with the same level of rigour as maximising the\n> good.\n\n## Expert 7: Resistance from governments and antagonising expert communities\n\n> I think people overestimate how likely it is that an intervention that\n> prevents global catastrophic biological risks (GCBRs) would be adopted by\n> governments. In my experience, it\u2019s challenging to get interventions that\n> provide measurable, real-world public health benefits funded and adopted \u2014\n> unless they can be proven to pay for themselves and offer regular benefits\n> that can be reported to decision makers.\n>\n> Interventions that may never be used or only be used very occasionally also\n> can\u2019t be tested for their accuracy and usefulness in a real-world setting.\n> Similar interventions used routinely can fail in unexpected ways or for\n> reasons that weren\u2019t considered, so getting regular feedback based on real-\n> world settings is crucial.\n>\n> This is especially important in determining whether decision makers and the\n> public trust the information provided, as a lack of trust or confidence can\n> undermine a perfectly good early warning system. I also see people treat\n> GCBR preparedness, public health, and global health interventions as\n> different things when in reality, there are solutions that can be used for\n> multiple purposes and can provide a better case for adoption if considered\n> jointly.\n>\n> Another issue I see is people positioning themselves in opposition to\n> pathogen researchers, synthetic biologists, AI developers, or people working\n> in public health due to disagreements about how they work and the\n> information they generate. I\u2019ve heard frustrations that these groups won\u2019t\n> engage on these issues from people who talk about them and to them in an\n> extremely negative way.\n>\n> I\u2019m not at all surprised that these groups aren\u2019t helpful and collaborative\n> when they\u2019re being insulted. These communities offer a wealth of knowledge\n> we desperately need to solve these problems effectively and taking an\n> adversarial stance causes them to respond in kind.\n>\n> When you engage these groups as collaborators, I\u2019ve found that they are\n> incredibly enthusiastic to get involved and adapt their practices. And when\n> they\u2019re not, it\u2019s because they see a real-world harm as a consequence of\n> caution that the biosecurity community hasn\u2019t recognized or valued enough.\n>\n> This approach also leaves people in biosecurity re-inventing the wheel when\n> existing solutions and infrastructure could be adapted to be more\n> biosecurity-forward. People working with infectious diseases regularly have\n> a great solution in mind that we could be advocating for instead of trying\n> to come up with something new, having had no experience of dealing with a\n> real outbreak.\n>\n> It can also lead to biosecurity folks developing an intervention that would\n> fail or not be adopted in practice. There seems to be this thinking that\n> pathogen and public health researchers are too short-sighted to care about\n> GCBRs or aren\u2019t clever/focussed enough to come up with solutions to the\n> problems we worry about. In reality, they\u2019ve often tried and either the\n> intervention didn\u2019t go as well as expected, or they couldn\u2019t get anyone to\n> pay for it.\n\n## Expert 8: Preparing for the \u201cBig One\u201d looks like preparing for the smaller\nones\n\n> I believe some in the effective altruism/longtermism community see a strong\n> disconnect between \u201cordinary\u201d pandemics of the kind we have recently\n> experienced or smaller, and \u201cexistential threats.\u201d While size and severity\n> surely matter, the systems for responding to one are the same ones that will\n> respond to the other \u2014 and failure to control a smaller one is the most\n> likely way in which we get to a larger one. So investments in preparing for\n> the \u201cBig One\u201d should primarily (maybe not exclusively) be those that also\n> prepare for the small and medium-sized ones.\n\n## Expert 9: ChatGPT is not dangerous\n\n> The one that I hear most recently is that ChatGPT is going to let people be\n> weaponeers. That drives me berserk because telling someone step-by-step how\n> to make a virus does not in any way allow them to make a weapon. It doesn\u2019t\n> tell them how to assemble it, doesn\u2019t tell them how to grow it up, it\n> doesn\u2019t tell them how to purify it, test it, deploy it, none of that.\n>\n> If you lined up all the steps in a timeline of how to create a bioweapon,\n> learning what the steps are would be this little chunk on the far left side.\n> It would take maybe 10 hours to figure that out with Google, and maybe\n> ChatGPT will give you that in one hour.\n>\n> But there\u2019s months and years worth of the rest of the process, and yet\n> everyone\u2019s running around saying, \u201cChatGPT is going to build a whole\n> generation of weaponeers!\u201d No way.\n>\n> Another dubious take is having information hazards rule everything. That we\n> should never do anything to create new information hazards.\n>\n> To me, that is crazy. Because you basically are saying you\u2019re going to shut\n> off your ability to understand the threat just because you\u2019re worried about\n> possibly informing someone somewhere a little bit more, despite the massive\n> pile of public literature that already exists.\n>\n> It really ends up being an argument about who\u2019s going to be faster, the\n> weaponeer or the person working on the defensive side. I would much rather\n> have that contest than unilaterally disarm, which is what the information\n> hazard argument insists we do.\n>\n> I would also argue weaponisation is a years-long timeline.\n>\n> We have never in human history created a virus from scratch to exploit a new\n> vulnerability in a biological system. I can\u2019t imagine that taking place in\n> less than a couple of years. Over the course of those years the individuals\n> will be throwing off lots of signals that would be detectable.\n>\n> And so the idea that those weaponeers would race to the finish in six months\n> and have a little tube that they could throw around \u2014 I just don\u2019t buy it. I\n> see no evidence of what humans have done so far that would get us anywhere\n> near any of that. And telling ourselves stories about how hard that is or\n> how easy that is, I think is really harmful.\n>\n> We should at least be realistic in our estimates and judgments of how hard\n> or easy that process would be. And right now, we\u2019re shortcutting all of that\n> and just writing science fiction.\n\n## Expert 10: The barriers to bioweapons are not that high\n\n> There are a lot of misconceptions out there, in part because the academic\n> community that writes about these things has been very small for a very long\n> time. A lot of the writings that are out there on biological weapons are\n> just wrong.\n>\n> It\u2019s hard because a lot of it is classified, but a simple example would be\n> the claim that a country would never use a communicable biological weapon\n> because it would blow back on their own people. The fact is that the Soviet\n> Union perfected smallpox as a biological weapon. So the fact that they did\n> it tells me that countries will do it.\n>\n> One misconception that may once have been somewhat true \u2014 but now it\u2019s much\n> less true, and in the future it will be even less true \u2014 is that tacit\n> knowledge is required to make biological weapons. That the barrier is so\n> high.\n>\n> I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. I actually don\u2019t think that was the case 20\n> years ago or 30 years ago, but it\u2019s certainly not the case today.\n>\n> I think it depends on which specific biological weapon. It\u2019s relatively easy\n> with the information available today for a determined small group or\n> individual to successfully produce and deliver biological weapons. There was\n> a book written about this that studied the Soviet program, and the author\n> spoke to many former Soviet bioweaponeers. I think it\u2019s natural that they\n> would exaggerate their craft and describe how \u201conly people with special\n> skills like me could do this.\u201d I think that biassed the conclusions of that\n> book.\n\n## Expert 11: We don\u2019t need silver bullets\n\n> Some people think laws and rules, and the tools and technologies used to\n> implement them, do not control bad actors. They only influence the behaviour\n> of good actors. But this misses the deterrent effect of laws and rules.\n>\n> Some people look only for silver bullets and they discount solutions that\n> might be circumvented. This misses the point that raising barriers to malign\n> misuse of technology can still be highly beneficial.\n\n## Expert 12: Three failure modes\n\n> A few misconceptions and mistakes:\n>\n>   1. Failure to engage broadly with knowledge and expertise in the community\n> and trying to reinvent things from scratch.\n>   2. Failure to account for the fact that biosecurity is exceptionally broad\n> and other people are likely solving for different problems and have\n> different threat models.\n>   3. Failure to get out into the world and talk with people \u2014 most\n> information still isn\u2019t written down.\n>\n\n## Expert 13: Groupthink and failing to be scope sensitive\n\n> I think that there\u2019s a lack of scope sensitivity. People are not treating\n> the catastrophic potential outcomes in biosecurity as six billion times more\n> concerning \u2014 or whatever the right multiplier would be \u2014 than the cases\n> where one or two people could get impacted.\n>\n> I also think there\u2019s some groupthink in the effective altruism biosecurity\n> community, and there is a very important need for people to work in and be\n> exposed to other communities that have some very different perspectives on\n> the issues to understand:\n>\n>   * Why are these the ideas that the effective altruism community has\n> produced?\n>   * Why aren\u2019t they being implemented?\n>   * Why do people disagree with them?\n>\n\n>\n> I think that there\u2019s a whole set of sort of feasibility and implementation\n> dynamics that are not well understood by many EAs in this field. I think\n> it\u2019s really important that people expose themselves to the organisations and\n> the people that have been working on this for a long time, the established\n> institutions and scientists, to have a better understanding of why people\n> are doing things the way they do. Sometimes you may still disagree and feel\n> a different approach would be better, but there\u2019s usually a logic to it that\n> is not always fully grasped.\n\n## Expert 14: COVID-19 does not equal biological weapons\n\n> One common misconception is that because SARS-CoV-2 [the virus that causes\n> COVID-19] was able to cause this horrific human pandemic, any biological\n> weapon would be equally devastating. That this pandemic exposed our\n> vulnerability to biological weapons and that state and non-state actors are\n> immediately going to exploit that vulnerability and attack with biological\n> weapons.\n>\n> I think that is misleading because this virus evolved to be as infectious\n> and contagious as it was. What Mother Nature is able to do with pathogens, I\n> think, exceeds what humans can still do in this respect.\n>\n> COVID-19 does not equal biological weapons, bluntly. This is a very specific\n> pandemic that emerged that is not the same as what any country has been able\n> to do in the past or any non-state actor is able to do.\n>\n> There is also an assumption that because this vulnerability was revealed,\n> lots of states and non-state actors are going to launch biological weapons\n> programmes.\n>\n> I don\u2019t necessarily think that\u2019s the case. Most countries and terrorist\n> groups don\u2019t have or want or need biological weapons because they will not\n> serve their purposes. We should not expect this dramatic change in calculus\n> based on this one natural pandemic. We\u2019ve had other pandemics historically,\n> lots of flu pandemics that have not resulted in wholesale changes in the way\n> that states or terrorist groups view these things.\n>\n> Because the reality is biological weapons just don\u2019t work that well and\n> aren\u2019t going to meet the objectives of countries and groups that are looking\n> for new capabilities.\n>\n> There are lots of misconceptions about how easy it is to develop and use a\n> biological weapon. There are a lot of steps that go into converting a\n> pathogen into an actual weapon that is capable of causing mass casualties,\n> and that process is not necessarily going to be published in the open\n> literature.\n>\n> It\u2019s not something that people can just learn in grad school, right? There\n> are very arcane knowledge and skills that go into this that are just not\n> readily accessible. So there\u2019s a very common downplaying of the role of\n> tacit knowledge in this process of weaponization. It\u2019s very easy for people\n> to claim that if you can culture a pathogen, and find it in nature, then you\n> can then turn it into a weapon to cause a pandemic or mass casualties.\n>\n> And that\u2019s just not the case. We\u2019ve seen nation states struggle to develop\n> these weapons and non-state actors have been very unsuccessful with them\n> because they are very challenging to acquire and develop and produce and use\n> properly.\n>\n> I guess the last misconception I\u2019ll highlight is that advances in life\n> sciences about technology are democratising the proliferation of biological\n> weapons \u2014 that this technology, these advances are easily converted into\n> misuse.\n>\n> And again, that\u2019s just not the case. The technologies that are developed are\n> usually developed for very specific civilian scientific purposes that would\n> need to be modified to be capable of causing mass casualties. That\u2019s not a\n> simple, straightforward, easy process by any means.\n>\n> People overestimate the degree of threats to biosecurity, which again, I\u2019m\n> not saying that there aren\u2019t any, but I\u2019m saying the tendency is more to\n> exaggerate the threats than not.\n>\n> And frequently this comes from people who don\u2019t understand the biology of\n> these organisms, and they come out of different epistemic communities. They\n> don\u2019t understand the nuances and the complexities involved in what it takes\n> to actually create a biological threat.\n>\n> It\u2019s safe to say that the knowledge and capabilities are increasing because\n> of advances in dual-use technologies. But that\u2019s very much a latent\n> capability that\u2019s increasing. It\u2019s another thing to say: OK, this latent\n> capability will transform into something capable of misuse, just assuming\n> that there\u2019s someone out there with an intent and motivation to do so.\n>\n> That latent capability for modifying pathogens or producing them is clearly\n> expanding in terms of our level of knowledge and the number of people out\n> there who are able to do it.
