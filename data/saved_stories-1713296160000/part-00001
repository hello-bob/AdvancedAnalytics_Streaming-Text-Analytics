Peter Attia argues that it doesn\u2019t have to be this way.\n\nBy Dhruv Khullar\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\nIn \u201cOutlive: The Science and Art of Longevity,\u201d Attia, one of the most\nprominent longevity evangelists, extrapolates from scientific data to offer\njarringly intense and specific advice.Illustration by Jun Cen\n\nListen to this article.\n\nSome of my earliest memories are of summers with my grandparents, in New\nDelhi. I spent long, scorching months drinking lassi, playing cricket, and\nhelping my grandparents find ripe mangoes at roadside markets. Then I\u2019d return\nto the U.S., my English rusty from disuse, and go months or years without\nseeing them. At some point, my India trips started to feel like snapshots of\nloss. My grandfathers died suddenly, probably of heart attacks. My Biji, my\nfather\u2019s mother, fell and broke her hip in her seventies, and she spent her\nlast years moving back and forth between her bed and her couch. My Nani, my\nmother\u2019s mother, developed excruciating arthritis in both knees; in order for\nher to leave her fifth-floor walkup, my uncle practically had to carry her\ndown the stairs. I have always wondered whether their fading vitality\u2014the way\ntheir worlds contracted and their possibilities vanished\u2014was an inevitability\nof aging or something that could have been averted.\n\nMany of us have come to expect that our bodies and minds will deteriorate in\nour final years\u2014that we may die feeble, either dependent or alone.\nParadoxically, this outcome is a kind of success. For most of history, humans\ndidn\u2019t live long enough to confront the ailments of old age. In 1900, a baby\nborn in the U.S. could expect to live just forty-seven years, and one in five\ndied before the age of ten. But twentieth-century victories against infectious\ndiseases\u2014in the form of sanitation, antibiotics, and vaccines\u2014dramatically\nextended life spans, and today the average newborn lives to around seventy-\nseven. Lately, though, progress has slowed. In the past six decades, medicine\nhas added about seven years to the average life span\u2014less by saving young\nlives than by extending old ones, and often in states of ill health. In many\ncases, we\u2019re prolonging the time it takes to die.\n\nA growing number of celebrity doctors, futurists, and so-called biohackers now\nargue that it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. There are, by some estimates,\nhundreds of specialized \u201clongevity clinics\u201d\u2014including some that charge six-\nfigure annual fees\u2014which claim to offer more of the world\u2019s most valuable\ncommodity: years of healthy life. Perhaps the most prominent longevity\nevangelist is Peter Attia, the author, with Bill Gifford, of the best-selling\nbook \u201cOutlive: The Science and Art of Longevity.\u201d Through his telemedicine\npractice in Austin, Texas, for an undisclosed price, Attia offers health\nadvice, diagnostic tests, exercise protocols, and supplements to a wealthy and\nexclusive clientele. He also interviews an eclectic mix of scientists,\ndoctors, and entrepreneurs for a popular podcast, \u201cThe Drive.\u201d Oprah has\ninterviewed him; Hugh Jackman and Gwyneth Paltrow follow his regimens.\n\nAttia graduated from medical school and trained to be a surgeon, but grew\ndisillusioned during residency and dropped out. He became a consultant for\nMcKinsey instead, and then worked for an energy company. Finally, in his mid-\nthirties, a fixation with his own health brought him back to medicine. As a\nnew father, he learned that he was prediabetic, and he reflected on men in his\nfamily who\u2019d died early, of heart disease. In his book, he describes his\nformer physique as \u201csausage-like\u201d; on a beach one day, his wife told him,\n\u201cPeter, I think you should work on being a little less not thin.\u201d Soon, he was\n\u201cdown the rabbit hole of complete physical optimization.\u201d\n\nAttia, now fifty-one, has become convinced that science, technology, and\ntargeted work can solve a uniquely modern problem: the \u201cmarginal decade\u201d at\nthe end of our lives, when medicine keeps us alive but our independence and\ncapacities bleed away. It\u2019s a scandal, in his view, that our life span has\ngrown so much more than our health span. Many of Attia\u2019s prescriptions are\nobvious: work out, eat healthily, sleep well, nurture relationships. (The\nHarvard Study of Adult Development has found, in eight decades, that human\nconnections may be the single most critical determinant of long-term happiness\nand health.) But Attia often extrapolates from scientific data to offer\njarringly intense and specific advice. Want to be able to lift a grandchild\nwhen you\u2019re eighty? Goblet squat fifty-five pounds when you\u2019re forty. Hope to\nlift yourself off the floor unassisted in old age? Try \u201ctoe yoga.\u201d Attia notes\nthat each decade after thirty we lose a meaningful amount of muscle mass and\ncardiovascular fitness. If we wish to slow that decline, and to complete a\n\u201cCentenarian Decathlon\u201d of important late-in-life activities\u2014carry groceries,\nclimb stairs, have sex\u2014we need to become \u201cathletes of life.\u201d\n\nThe increasing obsession with longevity has inspired a backlash. Many in the\nlife-extension movement are quacks or hacks who peddle pills, potions, and\nfalse promises; longevity skeptics tend to see the loss of our capacities as\nsomething to accept, not avoid. Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist and a health-\npolicy professor at the University of Pennsylvania, derides Attia as an\n\u201cAmerican immortal\u201d who overcomplicates straightforward advice. \u201cThe idea that\nyou\u2019re going to get another healthy decade of life just by doing the things he\nsays is hocus-pocus,\u201d Emanuel, who served as a special adviser to the Obama\nAdministration, told me. \u201cNo one\u2019s got that evidence.\u201d Half an hour of daily\nexercise clearly improves and extends lives, but it\u2019s hard to prove that\nAttia\u2019s intensive regimens are much more beneficial. By incessantly preparing\nfor the future, the skeptics say, we mistake a long life for a worthwhile one.\n\nOn a recent afternoon, I chased my three-year-old daughter around the\nplayground for an hour. When we returned home, she spread a jigsaw puzzle out\non the floor and looked up expectantly. I liked the idea of sitting still, but\nmy knees hurt and my back was tense. I had to transfer the puzzle to a grownup\ntable and sit my daughter in a booster seat. She didn\u2019t seem to mind, but I\nremember that day as the first time that my physical limits noticeably\nconstrained what we could do together. Longevity has become a concrete\nproblem, just as it was for my grandparents: I wake up with aches in long-\nignored joints and tendons; I calculate, with dismay, the age I\u2019ll be when my\nchildren graduate from college or start their own families. One day, we\u2019re\ngoing to die. What should that mean for how we live today?\n\nIn 1980, James Fries, a Stanford rheumatologist, predicted in The New England\nJournal of Medicine that better medicines and behaviors would soon enable a\n\u201ccompression of morbidity,\u201d which would delay disease and debility until the\nvery end of our lives. In the late nineties, Fries supported his hypothesis by\npublishing a decades-long study. University of Pennsylvania graduates who, in\ntheir forties, exercised more, weighed less, and didn\u2019t smoke much were half\nas likely as others to suffer a significant disability in their seventies;\nthey seemed to postpone the onset of disability by more than five years. But\nthe alumni of an \u00e9lite college may not have been representative. Fries died of\nend-stage dementia in 2021, at the age of eighty-three, and his broader\nprediction never seemed to come true. If anything, longer lives now appear to\ninclude more difficult years. The \u201ccompression of morbidity may be as illusory\nas immortality,\u201d two demographers, Eileen Crimmins and Hiram Beltr\u00e1n-S\u00e1nchez,\nwrote in 2010. According to the World Health Organization, the average\nAmerican can expect just one healthy birthday after the age of sixty-five.\n(Health spans are greater in countries such as Switzerland, Japan, Panama,\nTurkey, and Sri Lanka.)\n\nEarlier this year, I flew to Austin to hear Attia\u2019s thoughts about how to\nchange that. When my Uber pulled into his driveway, he was finishing his\nmorning workout, so an assistant led me inside, where I spent a few moments\nlooking at Formula 1 paraphernalia. Floor-to-ceiling windows overlooked lush\nhills, and a herd of life-size elk and deer models stood in the sun. I would\nsoon learn that they served as targets for archery practice.\n\nAttia has a shaved head, a sharp nose, and a stubbled chin, which make him\nlook like a mix of Stanley Tucci and Jeff Bezos. When he appeared, he was\nwearing a fitted T-shirt that emphasized his biceps. He led me to his kitchen,\nwhere he offered me coffee and mixed a brightly colored concoction for\nhimself. \u201cI always try to get some protein in the morning,\u201d he said. He eats\nas many as six sticks of venison jerky a day.\n\nVideo From The New Yorker\n\nTextures: For Black Women, Embracing Natural Hair Is About More than Style\n\nWhen I asked Attia about the longevity movement, he bristled. The term \u201cjust\nsmells of snake oil,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of what I see out there is what I think\nof as sci-fi longevity. We\u2019re going to live to be two hundred, and death is\ngoing to become irrelevant.\u201d He handed me my coffee. \u201cThe way I talk about it\nis in a very low-tech way.\u201d Attia has said that he wouldn\u2019t want to live\nforever, even if he could, and he seems wary of a stereotype of longevity\ndoctors. At parties, he sometimes pretends he\u2019s a race-car driver or a\nshepherd. \u201cI thought I was going to get skewered for writing \u2018Outlive,\u2019 \u201d he\ntold me. \u201cI thought doctors were going to say, \u2018This guy is a grifter. He\ndoesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about.\u2019 \u201d Some do say that\u2014but others have\nbecome his followers.\n\nLike a consultant, Attia often explains himself using frameworks. In the time\nof Hippocrates, he said, there was Medicine 1.0, a pre-modern system of\ndiagnosis and treatment based on observation, anecdote, and guesswork. In the\ntwentieth century, Medicine 2.0 deployed the randomized controlled trial to\nproduce scientific marvels such as dialysis, organ transplants, and antiviral\ndrugs. But Attia also sees Medicine 2.0, arguably the type of medicine that I\npractice, as passive. It often acts after the onset of damage\u2014debilitating\narthritis, a broken hip\u2014instead of aggressively and proactively warding off\nillness and injury. Attia preaches Medicine 3.0.\n\nWe sat down at a sort of command center in his home office. On a large\nmonitor, Attia pulled up a patient\u2019s \u201clongevity risk assessment\u201d\u2014his team\u2019s\ncalculation of threats to life and limb, ranked by relative importance both\nnow and in the future. Although Attia describes his approach as low-tech, his\npatients receive dozens of tests, some of them outside the medical mainstream:\nfull-body MRIs, body-fat-composition scans, DNA analyses. He often screens for\nAlzheimer\u2019s risk, something that many doctors advise against, in part because\npatients can\u2019t do much about a distressing result. (While filming an episode\nof the longevity docuseries \u201cLimitless,\u201d Chris Hemsworth, the host, learned\nfrom Attia that he has a gene associated with a roughly eight-hundred-per-cent\nincrease in Alzheimer\u2019s risk; afterward, Hemsworth took time off from acting.)\n\nThe assessment on Attia\u2019s monitor was for a middle-aged patient who had been\ngiven a diagnosis of attention-deficit disorder, and had also undergone\nseveral surgeries. Running down the left side of a chart was a list of\nconditions, starting with the ones that posed the greatest risk: emotional-\nhealth problems and physical injury. The right side showed percentages\u2014the\nguesstimated chance that each condition would become an issue in the future.\nCancer and neurodegenerative disease were small risks now, but they ballooned\ninto dominant hazards later in life. \u201cIt\u2019s more art than science,\u201d Attia told\nme. \u201cThere\u2019s no A.I. that\u2019s ever going to be able to spit out these numbers.\nIt requires clinical judgment.\u201d\n\nThe patient\u2019s results seemed to trouble Attia. \u201cThey\u2019re on a path to have a\nvery physically debilitated last decade of life,\u201d he said. (His practice\nomitted the names of patients and asked me to change their pronouns, to\nprotect their privacy.) Attia\u2019s staff focussed on three near-term suggestions:\nsee a recommended therapist, work with a recommended exercise team, get a\ncolonoscopy. They may have been powerful in their simplicity, but they were\nstandard enough that I wondered whether all that testing was really necessary.\n\nMany more patients will soon receive a version of Attia\u2019s advice. Not long\nago, he d\u00e9buted a program called Early, a kind of MasterClass on longevity\nwhich costs twenty-five hundred dollars to access online. In a series of slick\nvideos, Attia\u2014in the hybrid persona of doctor, teacher, and coach\u2014sits in a\nleather chair and talks about anticipating and averting diseases. Soft music\nplays; one video cuts to Attia\u2019s muscles tensing as he aims a manual crossbow\nand strikes a faraway target. \u201cHope is not a strategy,\u201d he says later, looking\ninto the camera. \u201cThe marginal decade is the most important decade.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked Attia what he sees as a threat to his own longevity, he spoke of\na lifelong battle to keep his emotions in check. He previously described\nhimself as a workaholic with anger-management issues. During a business trip\nin 2017, he received a call from his wife, who was in a state of terror: their\nmonth-old son had stopped breathing and turned blue, and didn\u2019t have a pulse.\nShe\u2019d started CPR on his tiny body. By the time first responders arrived, he\u2019d\nregained a heartbeat and his skin was transitioning to pink.\n\n\u201cOkay, call me when you get to the hospital, so I can talk to the doctors in\nthe ICU,\u201d Attia remembers telling her, in his book. Then he went to dinner.\nTen days passed before he flew home.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t try to forgive myself for it,\u201d Attia told me recently. \u201cThere was a\nreally, really broken person who did those things.\u201d He paused, as though\nreplaying the episode in his mind. \u201cDon\u2019t ever forget that that bastard is out\nthere. . . . And make sure you work really hard to keep him at bay.\u201d\n\nThe quest for physical optimization can easily become a substitute for deeper\nfulfillment. A decade ago, Attia exercised twenty-eight hours a week and\nobserved a strict ketogenic diet. His \u201cbiomarkers were out of this world,\u201d he\nhas said, but he refused cookies that his children baked for him and pasta\nduring trips to Italy. \u201cI was doing everything to live longer, despite being\ncompletely miserable emotionally,\u201d he writes in \u201cOutlive.\u201d In a recent\ninterview with the Times, Attia said that, before attending an event at his\nson\u2019s kindergarten, he thought for a moment of the downsides: it would eat\ninto his time for squats and deadlifts. \u201cThat\u2019s costing me a little in terms\nof fitness,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s the trade-off I wanted to make.\u201d\n\nAttia wouldn\u2019t tell me how many patients he sees, or how much they pay; there\nhas been speculation that his services cost around a hundred and fifty\nthousand dollars a year. One of his clients, Carl Barney, is the eighty-two-\nyear-old founder of a nonprofit inspired by Ayn Rand. He told me that, during\nthe past three years, Attia has encouraged him to diversify his exercise\nroutines and sleep more. At Attia\u2019s urging, he now scoops collagen protein\npowder into his morning tea, drinks bone broth before dinner, and tries to\nconsume another hundred-plus grams of protein during the day. I asked him\nwhether Attia\u2019s advice was worth the high price. \u201cI have wealth, so, for me,\nit\u2019s a bargain,\u201d he said.\n\nAttia let me join a video call in which five telegenic members of his team\ndiscussed new patients. A primary-care doctor told the group about a patient\nwho managed career stress by engaging in extreme sports. \u201cIf they can\u2019t do\nthose things, a lot of their coping mechanisms will crumble,\u201d she said. But it\nis difficult to quantify the risk that an injury might incapacitate someone.\n\u201cWe have questions like \u2018Do you wear a seat belt?\u2019 \u201d the doctor said. \u201cWe\ndon\u2019t have questions like \u2018Do you cliff-jump into the ocean?\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cHow much longer before your divorce goes through?\u201d\n\nCartoon by Jack Ziegler\n\nLink copied\n\nThe patient\u2019s tests had identified hearing and vision issues; a full-body MRI\nshowed ambiguous cysts in an internal organ. Genetic screenings suggested\nearly-dementia risks, and the patient had recently asked the team, \u201cShould I\njust quit my job right now and focus on living my life?\u201d But a neurologist\nobserved that the patient\u2019s relatives had developed dementia only later in\nlife. \u201cThis is probably going to be the most hopeful piece of news we give\nthem,\u201d Attia said. \u201cWe can say, clearly, no. . . . We have a lot of runway.\u201d\n\nI was envious that the doctors could pay so much attention to one patient.\nAttia had time to ask how well this person flossed\u2014something I don\u2019t ask my\nwife, let alone the patients I see in fifteen-minute increments. But the\nprimary-care doctor made me ponder whether there was such a thing as too much\nattention. The patient struggled with anxiety, she said, and seemed to be\nlooking for validation of their fitness routine. \u201cInstead, we show them all\nthese medical problems,\u201d she joked. \u201cAnd then we\u2019re, like, \u2018Why are they so\nanxious?\u2019 \u201d\n\nA few years ago, Attia started an intense fasting regimen. Some lab studies\nhave suggested that fasting may reduce inflammation and clear the body of\nprecancerous cells, but there is no agreed-upon \u201cdose\u201d for healthy fasting;\nAttia decided that for about two weeks each quarter he would drink only water.\nAfter losing fifteen pounds of muscle, however, he abandoned the practice. \u201cHe\nhas always been extreme,\u201d Steven Levitt, the University of Chicago economist\nand co-author of \u201cFreakonomics,\u201d who is a patient and a friend of Attia\u2019s,\ntold me. \u201cPeter has been wrong a lot, but he changes his view when he runs\ninto evidence that contradicts his theory.\u201d Levitt trusts and admires Attia,\nbut acknowledged that Attia\u2019s fans in the longevity movement could go too far.\n\u201cFollowers often become more extreme than the leaders,\u201d he told me.\n\nAttia takes rapamycin, a drug that affects the immune system and is normally\nused by organ-transplant patients; the drug, which occasionally gives him\nmouth sores, has seemed to lengthen the lives of laboratory animals. Animal\nexperiments are unreliable indicators of how drugs work in humans, and\nrapamycin is not endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration or medical\nsocieties for prolonging life. \u201cThis isn\u2019t like a vitamin,\u201d Eric Topol, a\ncardiologist and the director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute,\ntold me. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious drug that can potentially lower your body\u2019s ability\nto fight off infections.\u201d When I asked Attia why he has promoted the drug in\nhis book and on his podcast, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between saying\neveryone should take rapamycin and saying, \u2018I take rapamycin.\u2019 \u201d He also cited\na study suggesting that rapamycin bolstered immunity in elderly people.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Attia has prompted people to take the drug. Topol said that\nsome of his patients had read \u201cOutlive\u201d and then asked him for prescriptions.\n\u201cPeople see him as the expert, so they are going to try something if he says\nhe\u2019s doing it,\u201d he told me. \u201cHis followers aren\u2019t going to be able to detect\nwhich recommendations are firmly grounded in evidence.\u201d Meanwhile, training\ndozens of hours a week might take more time than it will ever tack on; good\nhealth could even drag out some terminal illnesses. \u201cPeter\u2019s theory of\nMedicine 3.0 is that you get this long life where you\u2019re healthy, and then you\nfall off a cliff,\u201d Topol said. \u201cIt would be great if it were true. There isn\u2019t\nany evidence for it.\u201d\n\nEmanuel, the University of Pennsylvania professor, has said that he wants to\nlive to seventy-five. (He is sixty-six.) \u201cLiving a long time is not an end in\nitself,\u201d he told me over Zoom. \u201cIf it becomes the focus of your life . . .\nthat is one of the worst mistakes you can make.\u201d It\u2019s not that we shouldn\u2019t\nexercise or eat well\u2014but \u201ceveryone goes through a decline,\u201d Emanuel said.\n\u201cSpending your life worried about all these tiny things is a waste of time.\u201d\n\nDuring our video call, Emanuel walked to his bookshelf, pulled out a copy of\n\u201cOutlive,\u201d and read a line from the epilogue: \u201cIt was only after much\nreflection on this whole experience that I really began to understand how\nemotional health relates to longevity.\u201d He slapped his palm against his\nforehead in a mock epiphany. \u201cOh, really? Longevity doesn\u2019t matter if your\nlife sucks? . . . I mean, come on. It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\n\nLeon Kass, who served as the chair of the President\u2019s Council on Bioethics\nunder George W. Bush, has written that losing our capacities might be a kind\nof prerequisite to accepting our mortality: maybe the slowing of body and mind\nis what makes death tolerable. He quotes Michel de Montaigne, the sixteenth-\ncentury essayist. \u201cInasmuch as I no longer cling so hard to the good things of\nlife when I begin to lose the use and pleasure of them, I come to view death\nwith much less frightened eyes,\u201d Montaigne wrote. \u201cWhen we are led by Nature\u2019s\nhand down a gentle and virtually imperceptible slope, bit by bit, one step at\na time, she rolls us into this wretched state and makes us familiar with it.\u201d\n\nNir Barzilai, the director of the Institute for Aging Research at the Albert\nEinstein College of Medicine, is sometimes credited with discovering the first\n\u201clongevity gene,\u201d an unusual variation in DNA that is linked to exceptionally\nlong life. When people ask him to define aging, however, he doesn\u2019t talk about\nthat, and instead tells a two-sentence story. An elderly woman turns to her\nhusband and says, \u201cHoney, why don\u2019t we go upstairs and make love?\u201d Her husband\nresponds, \u201cSweetie, I cannot do both.\u201d\n\nFor decades, Barzilai has followed hundreds of Ashkenazi Jews and examined\ngenetic, behavioral, and environmental factors that have helped them age past\nninety-five in exceptional health. Centenarians die of the same things as the\nrest of us, but later, he told me. You might live to a hundred if you could\npick your genes\u2014picking the healthy lunch option isn\u2019t likely to be enough.\nStrikingly, around half the centenarians in Barzilai\u2019s study have been\noverweight; thirty per cent of the women and sixty per cent of the men have\nbeen heavy smokers. When he asked a hundred-year-old whether anyone had warned\nher about the harms of tobacco, she responded, \u201cYes, all four of the doctors\nwho told me to stop smoking\u2014they died.\u201d\n\nAttia tends to argue that individual choices matter not because they are all-\npowerful but because they are the power that we have. He compares healthy\naging to investing in retirement: contribute what you can, whether it\u2019s a\ndaily walk or an extra half hour of sleep, and the benefits may compound over\ntime. \u201cIf I\u2019m being brutally honest, I think some people are looking for a\nreason not to do it because it\u2019s hard,\u201d he said.\n\nHe acknowledged that health, like wealth, is unequally distributed; indeed,\none of the most powerful longevity \u201cmedicines\u201d is money, which can buy people\nless stress, better education, safer neighborhoods, and higher-quality medical\ncare. For this reason, Emanuel argues that doctors should focus less on\n\u201cgetting rich people from ninety to a hundred\u201d than on improving health in\ncommunities where people die young. When I asked Attia whether his practice\nmight perpetuate this divide, he told me, \u201cI\u2019ve never concerned myself with\nthat. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unimportant, but it\u2019s absolutely not a problem I\u2019m\ninterested in addressing.\u201d He pointed out that his podcast is free and his\nbook costs less than twenty dollars.\n\nAttia has a term for his unproven ideas: evidence-informed medicine, or\ninterventions that rest more on theory than on randomized controlled trials in\nhumans. In his view, medical recommendations are often too conservative; in\nsome cases, rigorous studies would not only take too long but also be\nunethical or impractical. (Try randomly assigning babies to ketogenic diets at\nbirth.) According to Attia, medicine\u2019s admonition to do no harm is\n\u201csanctimonious bullshit\u201d that steers doctors toward passivity and resignation.\nBut this line of reasoning leaves enormous room for extrapolation, and could\nbe used to justify almost any practice.\n\nTalking to Attia, I frequently reminded myself that I can\u2019t diet and exercise\nmy way out of many diseases, and there\u2019s no regimen to eradicate uncertainty.\nStill, I felt the pull of becoming an \u201cathlete of life.\u201d Too often,\nconversations about life extension devolve into unhelpful abstractions and\nuntestable speculation; one appeal of Attia\u2019s advice is that it\u2019s so tangible.\nCritics can paint his counsel as blindingly obvious or needlessly complex\u2014but\nhe has, at least, inspired large audiences to imagine what a better approach\nto aging could look like. \u201cThere is actually no such thing as atheism,\u201d David\nFoster Wallace once said. \u201cThe only choice we get is what to worship.\u201d In a\nsociety that chases money, power, fame, and beauty, there are worse gods than\nlongevity.\n\nAttia is a history buff and an avid rucker, which means that he likes to lug a\nheavy rucksack on long walks. In June, to mark the eightieth anniversary of D\nDay, Attia plans to set out from Utah Beach, in Normandy, with four friends,\ncarrying supplies plus a twenty-five-pound weight, just because. They hope to\ntrek eighty kilometres through the night and arrive at Omaha Beach less than\ntwenty hours later.\n\nDuring my visit, Attia agreed to take me on a gentler ruck, in the hills\naround his neighborhood. We had lunch delivered beforehand; he had a salad\nwith chicken, nuts, and balsamic vinegar, while I had a saucy pasta. I caught\nhim glancing at my bowl and imagined him judging my macronutrients. Then I\nchanged into my workout gear and met him in his garage, where he outfitted me\nwith an Army-green rucksack. \u201cI generally recommend that people new to rucking\nstart light,\u201d he said, and slipped a thirty-pound weight plate into my bag. He\nadded a few to his own, and we set out into the afternoon sun.\n\nAfter climbing a hill, we entered a clearing. Around us, a circle of oak trees\nstretched majestically into the air. A mild breeze cooled the sweat on my\nbrow, and a flock of birds darted across the open sky. I considered stopping\nto look around, but I could hear the weights in Attia\u2019s rucksack clanging like\na metronome, so I sped up. I was feeling pretty good; I made a mental note to\noffer to take one of his plates. I changed my mind after the next hill, when\nmy neck stiffened and my shoulders started to hurt.\n\n\u201cWhy not just go for a hike?\u201d I asked, panting.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t find that as fun,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus, it\u2019s not as good for your\ntrunk.\u201d\n\nIn the distance, a school bus drove by. I envisioned myself lifting my\nhypothetical granddaughter one day, then adjusted my rucksack and straightened\nmy posture.\n\nAs we walked on, I thought about a curious body of psychological research,\nwhich suggests that as we age and lose our capacities we tend to grow more\ncontent, not less. This finding clashes with popular conceptions of getting\nolder, but seems to hold across continents, cultures, and eras. \u201cI can\u2019t do\neverything I used to,\u201d a family friend, who is in his eighties and has been\nmarried for sixty years, recently told me. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m any less\nhappy than I was before.\u201d Lost pleasures, he said, could sometimes be\nreplaced: rounds of golf gave way to brisk walks, and when walking became\ndifficult he spent more time talking to his children and grandchildren. As we\ngrasp that our days are limited, we seem to abdicate our need for control; we\nmay try to close the gap between what we want and what we have. Healthy aging\nseems to require a shift in mind-set as much as a shift in muscle mass.\n\nMy calves started to burn. I felt a knot in my back. White clouds veiled the\nsun, and a few ethereal rays came through. It looked so much like the entrance\nto TV Heaven that I half expected a deep voice to boom from above.\n\n\u201cSometimes I think about all the people who\u2019ve ever lived, and how lucky I am\nto be alive right now,\u201d Attia told me. \u201cLike, if I died tomorrow, it would be\nO.K.\u201d We started down a final hill. His house came into view. \u201cBut, while I\u2019m\nhere, I want to know that I gave it my all,\u201d he went on. \u201cWe have this one\nshot. Wouldn\u2019t it be a shame if we didn\u2019t make the most of it?\u201d \u2666\n\nPublished in the print edition of the April 22 & 29, 2024, issue, with the\nheadline \u201cNo Time to Die.\u201d\n\n## More Science and Technology\n\n  * Can we stop runaway A.I.?\n\n  * Saving the climate will depend on blue-collar workers.
