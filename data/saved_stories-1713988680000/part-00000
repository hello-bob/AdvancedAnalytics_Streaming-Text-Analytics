Most of the GPS problems reported on the\nwebsite have come in eastern Europe, bordering Russia.\n\nThe satellite-based GPS forms part of an aircraft\u2019s navigation system, and\ninterference can pose a safety risk.\n\nThe UK government confirmed in March that an RAF plane carrying the defence\nsecretary, Grant Shapps, had its GPS signal jammed while flying near the\nRussian Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad, while heading back to the UK from\nPoland.\n\nAlthough Downing Street said the move did not threaten the safety of the\naircraft, a defence source described it as \u201cwildly irresponsible\u201d.\n\nThe International Air Transport Association and the EU Aviation Safety Agency\n(Easa) held a summit in January to discuss GPS jamming and \u201cspoofing\u201d, or\nsending bogus signals, with Easa reporting a sharp rise in the number of\nattacks.\n\nWhile Easa said countering the threat was a priority, the UK\u2019s Civil Aviation\nAuthority played down the risk and said jamming was often associated with\nmilitary activity but did not mean commercial planes were being directly\ntargeted.\n\nGlenn Bradley, the head of flight operations at the CAA, said: \u201cAviation is\none of the safest forms of air travel and there are several safety protocols\nin place to protect navigation systems on commercial aircraft.\n\n\u201cGPS jamming does not directly impact the navigation of an aircraft, and while\nit is a known issue, this does not mean an aircraft has been jammed\ndeliberately.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Business Today\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and\nanalysis you need every morning\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

Ryanair\naircraft have multiple systems to identify aircraft location, including GPS.\nIf any of the location systems, such as GPS, are not functioning then the\ncrew, as part of standard operating procedures, switch to one of the alternate\nsystems.\u201d\n\nAn easyJet spokesperson said there were \u201cmultiple navigation systems onboard\ncommercial aircraft as well as procedures in place which mitigate against\nissues with GPS that can occur for various reasons\u201d.\n\nBA was approached for comment.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Airline industry\n  * Flights\n  * Ryanair\n  * British Airways\n  * Transport\n  * Russia\n  * Europe\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### United Airlines blames Boeing problems for $200m hit to earnings\n\n17 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### EasyJet and Wizz Air cancel flights to Tel Aviv after Iran attack on Israel\n\n15 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Heathrow urges government to scrap \u00a310 fee for transit passengers\n\n11 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### BA, easyJet and Wizz Air resume flights to and from Israel\n\n3 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Dutch airline KLM misled customers with vague green claims, court rules\n\n20 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### EasyJet joins calls for UK government to help fund hydrogen-powered flight\n\n18 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### United Airlines CEO vows to review recent safety incidents and learn \u2018the right lessons\u2019\n\n18 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Qantas workers suffered depression after being illegally sacked, compensation hearing told\n\n18 Mar 2024\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
