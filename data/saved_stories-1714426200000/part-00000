We have\nlong been a leader in news media innovation, pioneering the subscription model\nand engagement technologies, and this partnership will help keep us at the\nforefront of developments in how people access and use information.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe FT is committed to human journalism, as produced by our unrivalled\nnewsroom, and this agreement will broaden the reach of that work, while\ndeepening our understanding of reader demands and interests,\u201d Ridding added.\n\u201cApart from the benefits to the FT, there are broader implications for the\nindustry. It\u2019s right, of course, that AI platforms pay publishers for the use\nof their material. OpenAI understands the importance of transparency,\nattribution, and compensation \u2013 all essential for us. At the same time, it\u2019s\nclearly in the interests of users that these products contain reliable\nsources.\u201d\n\nBrad Lightcap, COO of OpenAI, expressed enthusiasm about the evolving\nrelationship with the Financial Times, stating: \u201cOur partnership and ongoing\ndialogue with the FT is about finding creative and productive ways for AI to\nempower news organisations and journalists, and enrich the ChatGPT experience\nwith real-time, world-class journalism for millions of people around the\nworld.\u201d\n\n\"We're keen to explore the practical outcomes regarding news sources and AI\nthrough this partnership,\u201d said Ridding. \u201cWe value the opportunity to be\ninside the development loop as people discover content in new ways. As with\nany transformative technology, there is potential for significant advancements\nand major challenges, but what\u2019s never possible is turning back time. It\u2019s\nimportant for us to represent quality journalism as these products take shape\n\u2013 with the appropriate safeguards in place to protect the FT\u2019s content and\nbrand.\n\nWe have always embraced new technologies and disruption, and we\u2019ll continue to\noperate with both curiosity and vigilance as we navigate this next wave of\nchange.\u201d\n\nEnds\n\nFor more information, please contact: Cappi Williamson, Financial Times | cappi.williamson@ft.com\n\nAbout the Financial Times\n\nThe Financial Times is one of the world\u2019s leading business news organisations,\nrenowned for its authoritative, accurate, and incisive journalism.
