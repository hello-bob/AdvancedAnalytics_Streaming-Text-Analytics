ROCm 6.1 is heavy on new\nfeatures as well as expanding official operating system coverage to include\nthe latest Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS point release.\n\nA new component with ROCm 6.1 is the introduction of rocDecode, which is\nadding accelerated video decoding to the ROCm compute stack. The release notes\nexplain of this new AMD video decode option:\n\n> \"rocDecode, a new ROCm component that provides high-performance video decode\n> support for AMD GPUs. With rocDecode, you can decode compressed video\n> streams while keeping the resulting YUV frames in video memory. With decoded\n> frames in video memory, you can run video post-processing using ROCm HIP,\n> avoiding unnecessary data copies via the PCIe bus.\"\n\nROCm 6.1 also provides integration with the AMD EPYC System Management\nInterface (E-SMI) for this Linux library to provide user-space APIs for\nmonitoring and control of CPU features.\n\nThe composable kernel support with ROCm 6.1 adds efficient image denoising for\nthe AMD GPU targets of gfx1030, gfx1100, gfx1031, gfx1101, gfx1032, gfx1102,\ngfx1034, gfx1103, gfx1035, and gfx1036.\n\nROCm 6.1 also provides various minor additions to HIP, hipBLASLt, hipFFt,\nHIPIFY, hipSPARSELt, hipTensor, MiGraphX, MIOpen, OpenMP, and more. Notable\nwith MIOpen is improved performance for inference and convolutions. Over on\nthe MIGraphX side is better performance of transformer-based models and a new\nTorch-MIGraphX driver to use MIGraphX directly from PyTorch.\n\nRounding out the significant ROCm 6.1 release is further optimizations and\nrefinements of the AMD Instinct MI300X / MI300A hardware support.\n\nMore details on today's ROCm 6.1 release via GitHub.\n\n13 Comments\n\nRelated News\n\nAMD Prepares More Next-Gen GPU Driver Support For Linux 6.10\n\nOpen-Source Radeon Driver Enables Support For Vulkan Video H.264/H.265 Encode\n\nAMD Working To Release MES Documentation & Source Code\n\nAMD Says They'll Be Open-Sourcing More Of Their GPU Software Stack & Hardware\nDocs\n\nAMD's Longtime Open-Source Linux Graphics Driver Advocate Retires\n\nAMD Releases Orochi 2.0 With More CUDA/HIP Functions Implemented For Better\nPortability\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
