Although Discord threatened the anonymous\nfounder with \u2018appropriate legal actions,\u2019 it appears that the website has been\nrelaunched and is currently operating under a new domain \u2014 spy(.)pm.\u201d\n\n## Infostealing malware infection of spy.pet\u2019s owner\n\nIn recent years, infostealing malware infections have been on the rise. With\nover 500,000 computers infected every month due to downloading fake software,\nit is not uncommon for even the most tech-savvy individuals to fall victim.\nOne such victim happened to be the owner of spy.pet.\n\nOn April 11, 2023, a computer with a Japanese IP was infected by a Raccoon\ntype Infostealer, resulting in over 4420 (!) credentials being stolen from the\ncomputer.\n\nHudson Rock\u2019s automated sorting which categorizes credentials into employees\nand users based on their sensitivity, identified over 37 sensitive credentials\nused for the infrastructure of spy.pet:\n\nScreenshot from Hudson Rock\u2019s Cavalier platform which shows the sensitive\nspy.pet credentials that were captured by the Infostealer\n\nCredentials which are stored on browsers are almost guaranteed to work and due\nto the sensitivity of the credentials that were exfiltrated from the computer\n(webmail.spy.pet, server.spy.pet, dev.spy.pet) it is likely that hackers who\nobtained the same data were able to hack into spy.pet and possibly steal the\nmassive 300,000,000 Discord users database.\n\nIf true, this could indicate that the massive database of spy.pet is\ncirculating among hackers, or potentially even being sold.\n\nThis is especially critical because Infostealers data is actively bought by\nhackers with the specific intention of breaching into organizations, accounts,\nand services-\n\nFlow of Infostealers data in the hacking ecosystem\n\n## Owner\u2019s Identity\n\nFrom the moment spy.pet was launched, it is likely that the owner knew that\nthe website would be considered illegal and made attempts to conceal their\nidentity. This is evident in the absence of any information relating to the\nowner or team behind the project on the website.\n\nFollowing the controversy surrounding spy.pet and Discord\u2019s active attempts to\ntake appropriate legal action, it was safe to assume that unless the culprit\u2019s\nidentity could be found using traditional methods, Discord would likely come\nup empty-handed.\n\nThis is when the Infostealer infection comes to play \u2014 once a computer is\ninfected by an Infostealer, typically any hopes for the privacy of the victim\nis lost due to the massive amounts of data that is being captured \u2014\n\nData typically retrieved by Infostealers\n\nAnd while the specific Infostealer infection of spy.pet\u2019s owner did not result\nin the retrieval of much of the aforementioned data, Hudson Rock\u2019s researchers\nwere still able to analyze the data and identify the owner\u2019s identity.\n\nFor example, grouping the email addresses found on the computer by their\noccurrences results in several email surfacing as the most commonly used by\nthe owner:\n\nMost common email addresses found on the infected computer\n\nA simple investigation around these email addresses reveal the owner\u2019s real\nidentity on a Github account:\n\nGithub account of spy.pet\u2019s owner\n\nIn another example, the full name of the owner appears simply as the username\nto one of the services.\n\nIn addition, spy.pet\u2019s owner is registered to a significant amount of\ncybercrime forums, indicating their interest in cybercrime:\n\nCybercrime forum credentials identified on the computer\n\nHudson Rock will share this information with Discord, hopefully aiding in\nshutting down any future attempts to launch spy.pet.\n\nInfostealer infections as a cybercrime trend surged by an incredible 6000%\nsince 2018, positioning them as the primary initial attack vector used by\nthreat actors to infiltrate organizations and execute cyberattacks, including\nransomware, data breaches, account overtakes, and corporate espionage.\n\nTo learn more about how Hudson Rock protects companies from imminent\nintrusions caused by info-stealer infections of employees, partners, and\nusers, as well as how we enrich existing cybersecurity solutions with our\ncybercrime intelligence API, please schedule a call with us, here:\nhttps://www.hudsonrock.com/schedule-demo\n\nHudson Rock provides access to various free cybercrime intelligence tools that\nyou can find here: www.hudsonrock.com/free-tools\n\nPrevPrevious\n\n## Don\u2019t Stop Here\n\n## More To Explore\n\n### Single Citrix Compromised Credential Results in $22,000,000 Ransom to\nChange Healthcare\n\nIn late February 2024 Change Healthcare suffered a devastating ransomware\nattack which led to major disruptions to the company\u2019s platform, estimated at\na staggering $872,000,000\n\nMay 1, 2024\n\n### Distribution of Infostealer Made With Electron\n\nAhnLab SEcurity intelligence Center (ASEC) has discovered an Infostealer\nstrain made with Electron.
