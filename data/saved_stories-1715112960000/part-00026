In this process, specialized software tools,\nknown as automated penetration testing tools or vulnerability scanners, are\nused to simulate the actions of a skilled security tester. These tests can\ninclude detecting outdated software versions, common passwords, or\nconfiguration errors that may expose the system to potential attacks.\nAutomated penetration testing offers efficiency and scalability, allowing\norganizations to regularly assess their security posture without the need for\ncontinuous human intervention.\n\n#### How long does a scan take?\n\nAn automated scan can take from 20 minutes to several hours depending on your\nsystem and environment. The TEQNIX will detect the technology used by your\ndomain and automatically select what security checks to apply.\n\n#### What results does TEQNIX provide?\n\nTEQNIX will perform various checks against your target domain and highlight\nall identfied security weaknesses. The scanners can detect security issues as\ndefined by security standards such as PCI-DSS, ISO/IEC 27001 or ASVS for\nexternally exposed assets. A a web UI and a PDF report is generated with\ndetailed technical findings, severity ratings and a summary. If you need\nfurther information or have any questions feel free to reach out.\n\n#### Is automated testing better than manual testing?\n\nA combination of the two is the best approach. Do not believe to vendors who\nwill promise you the same result. Manual testing is recommended for custom and\nmore complex systems. For example, if you have implemented your own custom API\nor a web application. Automation will still be able to detect the exposed bugs\nand manual testing can be used to focus on the logical aspects of your\napplication.\n\n#### I just need some help here!?\n\nWe hear you.
