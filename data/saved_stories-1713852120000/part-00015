We show that for the task of code\n> summarization, the performance of these models on individual examples often\n> depends on the amount of (subword) token overlap between the code and the\n> corresponding reference natural language descriptions in the dataset. This\n> token overlap arises because the reference descriptions in standard datasets\n> (corresponding to docstrings in large code bases) are often highly similar\n> to the names of the functions they describe. We also show that this token\n> overlap occurs largely in the function names of the code and compare the\n> relative performance of these models after removing function names versus\n> removing code structure. We also show that using multiple evaluation metrics\n> like BLEU and BERTScore gives us very little additional insight since these\n> metrics are highly correlated with each other.\n\nSubjects:| Software Engineering (cs.SE); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI);\nComputation and Language (cs.CL)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.08018 [cs.SE]  \n(or arXiv:2404.08018v1 [cs.SE] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.08018arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Rajarshi Haldar [view email] [v1] Wed, 10 Apr 2024 22:42:18 UTC (7,924\nKB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Analyzing the Performance of Large Language\nModels on Code Summarization, by Rajarshi Haldar and 1 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.SE\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI cs.CL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
