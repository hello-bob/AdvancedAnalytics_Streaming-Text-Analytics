Chandler, Massachusetts Institute of Technology May 4, 2024\n\nResearchers at MIT have discovered that evaporation can occur through exposure\nto light, not just heat. This process, observed on various water surfaces, has\nprofound implications for climate modeling and innovative technologies like\nsolar-driven water purification. (Artist\u2019s concept.) Credit: SciTechDaily.com\n\nMIT researchers have uncovered that light can induce evaporation, not just\nheat, demonstrating this across various natural and synthetic water surfaces.\nThis discovery could impact climate modeling and lead to innovations in solar\nenergy and water purification technologies.\n\nIt\u2019s the most fundamental of processes \u2014 the evaporation of water from the\nsurfaces of oceans and lakes, the burning off of fog in the morning sun, and\nthe drying of briny ponds that leaves solid salt behind. Evaporation is all\naround us, and humans have been observing it and making use of it for as long\nas we have existed.\n\nAnd yet, it turns out, we\u2019ve been missing a major part of the picture all\nalong.\n\n#### Light-Induced Evaporation Discovery\n\nIn a series of painstakingly precise experiments, a team of researchers at MIT\nhas demonstrated that heat isn\u2019t alone in causing water to evaporate. Light,\nstriking the water\u2019s surface where air and water meet, can break water\nmolecules away and float them into the air, causing evaporation in the absence\nof any source of heat.\n\nThe astonishing new discovery could have a wide range of significant\nimplications. It could help explain mysterious measurements over the years of\nhow sunlight affects clouds, and therefore affect calculations of the effects\nof climate change on cloud cover and precipitation. It could also lead to new\nways of designing industrial processes such as solar-powered desalination or\ndrying of materials.\n\nResearchers at MIT have discovered a new phenomenon: that light can cause\nevaporation of water from its surface without the need for heat.

And\nof course, it also affects the basic science, like the effects of clouds on\nclimate, because clouds are the most uncertain aspect of climate models.\u201d\n\n#### A Newfound Phenomenon\n\nThe new work builds on research reported last year, which described this new\n\u201cphotomolecular effect\u201d but only under very specialized conditions: on the\nsurface of specially prepared hydrogels soaked with water. In the new study,\nthe researchers demonstrate that the hydrogel is not necessary for the\nprocess; it occurs at any water surface exposed to light, whether it\u2019s a flat\nsurface like a body of water or a curved surface like a droplet of cloud\nvapor.\n\nBecause the effect was so unexpected, the team worked to prove its existence\nwith as many different lines of evidence as possible. In this study, they\nreport 14 different kinds of tests and measurements they carried out to\nestablish that water was indeed evaporating \u2014 that is, molecules of water were\nbeing knocked loose from the water\u2019s surface and wafted into the air \u2014 due to\nthe light alone, not by heat, which was long assumed to be the only mechanism\ninvolved.\n\nThe authors say their study suggests that the photomolecular effect should\nhappen widely in nature, from clouds to fogs, ocean to soil surfaces, and\nplant transpiration. \u201cI think this has a lot of applications,\u201d Gang Chen,\npictured in center, says. Chen stands with authors Guangxin Lv, on left, and\nJames Zhang. Author Yaodong Tu is not pictured. Credit: Bryce Vickmark\n\nOne key indicator, which showed up consistently in four different kinds of\nexperiments under different conditions, was that as the water began to\nevaporate from a test container under visible light, the air temperature\nmeasured above the water\u2019s surface cooled down and then leveled off, showing\nthat thermal energy was not the driving force behind the effect.\n\nOther key indicators that showed up included the way the evaporation effect\nvaried depending on the angle of the light, the exact color of the light, and\nits polarization. None of these varying characteristics should happen because\nat these wavelengths, water hardly absorbs light at all \u2014 and yet the\nresearchers observed them.\n\nThe effect is strongest when light hits the water surface at an angle of 45\ndegrees. It is also strongest with a certain type of polarization, called\ntransverse magnetic polarization. And it peaks in green light \u2014 which, oddly,\nis the color for which water is most transparent and thus interacts the least.\n\nChen and his co-researchers have proposed a physical mechanism that can\nexplain the angle and polarization dependence of the effect, showing that the\nphotons of light can impart a net force on water molecules at the water\nsurface that is sufficient to knock them loose from the body of water. But\nthey cannot yet account for the color dependence, which they say will require\nfurther study.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re exploring all these different directions,\u201d Chen says. \u201cAnd of course it\nalso affects the basic science, like the effects of clouds on climate, because\nclouds are the most uncertain aspect of climate models.\u201d Credit: Bryce\nVickmark\n\nThey have named this the photomolecular effect, by analogy with the\nphotoelectric effect that was discovered by Heinrich Hertz in 1887 and finally\nexplained by Albert Einstein in 1905. That effect was one of the first\ndemonstrations that light also has particle characteristics, which had major\nimplications in physics and led to a wide variety of applications, including\nLEDs. Just as the photoelectric effect liberates electrons from atoms in a\nmaterial in response to being hit by a photon of light, the photomolecular\neffect shows that photons can liberate entire molecules from a liquid surface,\nthe researchers say.\n\n\u201cThe finding of evaporation caused by light instead of heat provides new\ndisruptive knowledge of light-water interaction,\u201d says Xiulin Ruan, professor\nof mechanical engineering at Purdue University, who was not involved in the\nstudy. \u201cIt could help us gain new understanding of how sunlight interacts with\ncloud, fog, oceans, and other natural water bodies to affect weather and\nclimate. It has significant potential practical applications such as high-\nperformance water desalination driven by solar energy. This research is among\nthe rare group of truly revolutionary discoveries which are not widely\naccepted by the community right away but take time, sometimes a long time, to\nbe confirmed.\u201d\n\nBecause the effect is so new and unexpected, Chen says, \u201cthis phenomenon\nshould be very general, and our experiment is really just the beginning.\u201d\nCredit: Bryce Vickmark\n\n#### Solving a Cloud Conundrum\n\nThe finding may solve an 80-year-old mystery in climate science. Measurements\nof how clouds absorb sunlight have often shown that they are absorbing more\nsunlight than conventional physics dictates possible. The additional\nevaporation caused by this effect could account for the longstanding\ndiscrepancy, which has been a subject of dispute since such measurements are\ndifficult to make.\n\n\u201cThose experiments are based on satellite data and flight data,\u201c Chen\nexplains. \u201cThey fly an airplane on top of and below the clouds, and there are\nalso data based on the ocean temperature and radiation balance. And they all\nconclude that there is more absorption by clouds than theory could calculate.\nHowever, due to the complexity of clouds and the difficulties of making such\nmeasurements, researchers have been debating whether such discrepancies are\nreal or not. And what we discovered suggests that hey, there\u2019s another\nmechanism for cloud absorption, which was not accounted for, and this\nmechanism might explain the discrepancies.\u201d\n\nChen says he recently spoke about the phenomenon at an American Physical\nSociety conference, and one physicist there who studies clouds and climate\nsaid they had never thought about this possibility, which could affect\ncalculations of the complex effects of clouds on climate. The team conducted\nexperiments using LEDs shining on an artificial cloud chamber, and they\nobserved heating of the fog, which was not supposed to happen since water does\nnot absorb in the visible spectrum. \u201cSuch heating can be explained based on\nthe photomolecular effect more easily,\u201d he says.\n\nLv says that of the many lines of evidence, \u201cthe flat region in the air-side\ntemperature distribution above hot water will be the easiest for people to\nreproduce.\u201d That temperature profile \u201cis a signature\u201d that demonstrates the\neffect clearly, he says.\n\nZhang adds: \u201cIt is quite hard to explain how this kind of flat temperature\nprofile comes about without invoking some other mechanism\u201d beyond the accepted\ntheories of thermal evaporation. \u201cIt ties together what a whole lot of people\nare reporting in their solar desalination devices,\u201d which again show\nevaporation rates that cannot be explained by the thermal input.\n\nThe effect can be substantial. Under the optimum conditions of color, angle,\nand polarization, Lv says, \u201cthe evaporation rate is four times the thermal\nlimit.\u201d\n\n#### Practical Applications and Future Research\n\nAlready, since the publication of the first paper, the team has been\napproached by companies that hope to harness the effect, Chen says, including\nfor evaporating syrup and drying paper in a paper mill. The likeliest first\napplications will come in the areas of solar desalinization systems or other\nindustrial drying processes, he says. \u201cDrying consumes 20 percent of all\nindustrial energy usage,\u201d he points out.\n\nBecause the effect is so new and unexpected, Chen says, \u201cThis phenomenon\nshould be very general, and our experiment is really just the beginning.\u201d The\nexperiments needed to demonstrate and quantify the effect are very time-\nconsuming. \u201cThere are many variables, from understanding water itself, to\nextending to other materials, other liquids and even solids,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe observations in the manuscript points to a new physical mechanism that\nfoundationally alters our thinking on the kinetics of evaporation,\u201d says\nShannon Yee, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at Georgia Tech,\nwho was not associated with this work. He adds, \u201cWho would have thought that\nwe are still learning about something as quotidian as water evaporating?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think this work is very significant scientifically because it presents a\nnew mechanism,\u201d says University of Alberta Distinguished Professor Janet A.W.\nElliott, who also was not associated with this work. \u201cIt may also turn out to\nbe practically important for technology and our understanding of nature,\nbecause evaporation of water is ubiquitous and the effect appears to deliver\nsignificantly higher evaporation rates than the known thermal mechanism. ...\nMy overall impression is this work is outstanding. It appears to be carefully\ndone with many precise experiments lending support for one another.\u201d\n\nReference: \u201cPhotomolecular effect: Visible light interaction with air\u2013water\ninterface\u201d by Guangxin Lv, Yaodong Tu, James H.
