In a study, researchers observed that individuals whose pupils\ndilated more while performing memory tasks tended to have better working\nmemory.\n\nThis relationship between pupil dilation and memory performance suggests that\npupil metrics could potentially serve as non-invasive indicators of cognitive\nload and memory capacity. The study involved 179 undergraduate students who\nperformed various working memory tasks while their pupil responses were\nmonitored.\n\nKey Facts:\n\n  1. The study found a positive correlation between pupil dilation during cognitive tasks and higher working memory performance.\n  2. Participants with greater pupil dilation were able to better recall and process information.\n  3. This research opens the possibility of using pupil dilation as a simple, non-invasive measure of working memory in cognitive assessments.\n\nSource: UT Arlington\n\nWorking memory is one of the brain\u2019s executive functions, a skill that allows\nhumans to process information without losing track of what they\u2019re doing.\n\nIn the short term, working memory allows the brain to complete an immediate\ntask, like loading the dishwasher. Long-term, it helps the brain decide what\nto store for future use, such as whether more dishwasher soap will be needed.\n\n\u201cWhat we found was that the lowest performers on the tasks showed less pupil\ndilation,\u201d Robison said. Credit: Neuroscience News\n\nUniversity of Texas at Arlington researchers know that working memory varies\ngreatly among individuals, but they aren\u2019t sure exactly why.\n\nTo better understand, Matthew Robison, assistant professor of psychology, and\ndoctoral student Lauren D. Garner conducted an experiment to see whether\nstudying a person\u2019s pupils (the centers of their eyes) was a good indicator of\nworking memory.\n\nNormally, a person\u2019s pupils naturally widen (or dilate) in low-light\nenvironments to allow more light into the eye.\n\nHowever, in their new study published in Attention, Perception, &\nPsychophysics, the researchers reported that a person\u2019s pupils also dilate\nwhen they are concentrating on tasks.\n\nIn particular, they found that the more a person\u2019s eyes dilated during the\ntask, the better they did on tests measuring their working memory.\n\n\u201cWhat we found was that the lowest performers on the tasks showed less pupil\ndilation,\u201d Robison said.\n\n\u201cFor the highest-performing participants, their pupil dilations were both\nlarger overall and the individuals were more discerning about the information\nthey were asked to recall.\u201d\n\nFor the study, he and Garner recruited 179 undergraduate students at UT\nArlington. Participants completed several working memory tasks where they were\npresented with information and then asked to remember it for a few seconds.\n\nDuring the tasks, participants had their pupils continuously measured using an\neye-tracker, similar to what optometrists use during eye exams.\n\n\u201cWe found that people who more intensely and consistently paid attention, as\nmeasured by their pupils being dilated more, performed better on the memory\ntasks,\u201d said Robison.\n\n\u201cImportantly, we found high performers also showed more pupil sensitivity\ncompared to low-performing participants. This is exciting research because it\nadds another valuable piece of the puzzle to our understanding of why working\nmemory varies between individuals.\u201d\n\n## About this memory and visual neuroscience research news\n\nAuthor: Katherine Egan Bennett Source: UT Arlington Contact: Katherine Egan\nBennett \u2013 UT Arlington Image: The image is credited to Neuroscience News\n\nOriginal Research: Closed access. \u201cPupillary correlates of individual\ndifferences in n-back task performance\u201d by Matthew K. Robison et al.\nAttention, Perception, & Psychophysics\n\nAbstract\n\nPupillary correlates of individual differences in n-back task performance\n\nWe used pupillometry during a 2-back task to examine individual differences in\nthe intensity and consistency of attention and their relative role in a\nworking memory task.\n\nWe used sensitivity, or the ability to distinguish targets (2-back matches)\nand nontargets, as the measure of task performance; task-evoked pupillary\nresponses (TEPRs) as the measure of attentional intensity; and intraindividual\npretrial pupil variability as the measure of attentional consistency.\n\nTEPRs were greater on target trials compared with nontarget trials, although\nthere was no difference in TEPR magnitude when participants answered correctly\nor incorrectly to targets.\n\nImportantly, this effect interacted with performance: high performers showed a\ngreater separation in their TEPRs between targets and nontargets, whereas\nthere was little difference for low performers.\n\nFurther, in regression analysis, larger TEPRs on target trials predicted\nbetter performance, whereas larger TEPRs on nontarget trials predicted worse\nperformance.\n\nSensitivity positively correlated with average pretrial pupil diameter and\nnegatively correlated with intraindividual variability in pretrial pupil\ndiameter.\n\nOverall, we found evidence that both attentional intensity (TEPRs) and\nconsistency (pretrial pupil variation) predict performance on an n-back\nworking memory task.\n\nTags\n\nbrain researchMemoryneurobiologyNeurosciencepupil dilationUT arlingtonvisual\nneuroscienceworking memory\n\nShareTweetShareShareSubmitEmail\n\nNeuroscience News\n\nNeuroscience News posts science research news from labs, universities,\nhospitals and news departments around the world.
