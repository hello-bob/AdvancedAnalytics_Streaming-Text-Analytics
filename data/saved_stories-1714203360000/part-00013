These devs were interviewed earlier this year about\nlive-service games. For purposes of the survey, live-service games are defined\nas online titles that feature frequent updates and in-app purchases. When\nasked about these kinds of always-online forever games, most developers didn\u2019t\nhave positive opinions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nAAA Game Dev To Frustrated Fans: 'We're Human Beings'\n\nGame Devs Of Color Expo Is Full Of Great Free Steam Demos, Melanin\n\nThe Top 10 Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2024 Edition\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nThe Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2024 Edition\n\nAs reported by Game Developer, 39 percent of surveyed devs had \u201cmild worries\u201d\nover current live-service business models. Another 31 percent said they were\n\u201cvery\u201d concerned. Meanwhile, a combined 29 percent were unsure or had no\nfears.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen it comes to how live-service games impact the industry, 45 percent view\nthese online games negatively, while 44 percent have a more mixed view.\nOverall, that\u2019s not a ringing endorsement of our live-service future from the\npeople being asked by publishers to develop these expensive, time-consuming\nprojects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Devs say live-service games are hard to support\n\nAccording to the study, the major concern among developers is sustainability.\n63 percent of devs are worried that players will eventually lose interest. 62\npercent also admitted they were afraid that other big games would steal away\ntheir players. Also revealed in the survey: 57 percent said it will be\ndifficult to hold players\u2019 interest long term.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRegardless of how a big online game loses players, the end result is rarely\ngood for those involved. A live-service game failing and shutting down can\nlead to layoffs and studio closures. And with only so many players in the\nworld willing to spend the time and money on these games, it seems some devs\nare worried that the endless war for players\u2019 time and dollars will get worse\nas more publishers embrace the live-service model.\n\nInterestingly, 30 percent of devs said that their studios were once again\nexploring paid DLC, a type of post-release content that has become less common\nduring the rise of live-service games. Even more interesting is that 76\npercent of devs were looking at putting games behind an upfront payment\ninstead of going free-to-play.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRemember that what developers want to do and how they feel aren\u2019t important to\ngreedy publishers and execs who seem to be pushing full steam ahead on live-\nservice games, as a survey in February revealed. That survey showed that over\n500 studios were apparently working on live-service online video games. While\nsome questioned that study\u2019s criteria, the reality is that publishers have\nmade it clear that the live-service model is here to stay, even if this new\nsurvey shows that developers aren\u2019t sure how sustainable this pivot to forever\ngames will be in the end.\n\n.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
