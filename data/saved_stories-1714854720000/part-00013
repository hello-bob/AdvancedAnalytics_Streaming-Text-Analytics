These include surveillance, authoritarian censorship, cyberwarfare,\nhacking, exclusion, and domination by corporations (see 10 Reasons to Fight\nCashless Contagion). The fintech industry, by contrast, studiously avoids\ntalking about these \u2018political\u2019 things, and focuses rather on \u2018economic\u2019\nconsiderations like innovation and efficiency. In the fintech worldview, cash\nis neither innovative nor efficient, which means it must give way to digital\npayments like a horsecart moving aside for sportcars.\n\nTheir progress narrative can be destabilized by simply recasting cash as the\nbicycle of payments (and digital as the Uber, rather than the sportcar), but\ntheir rhetoric remains powerful and disorientating for the public. The\nlanguage of innovation is the native tongue of entrepreneurs, and for a long\ntime that\u2019s been politically untouchable - who would ever dare to be against\ninnovation? The language of efficiency is borrowed from conventional\neconomists, but it\u2019s equally politically untouchable. In the neoliberal era,\ngovernments have been desperate to show that they opt for the cheapest path,\nand if it\u2019s narrowly more efficient for society to slump into dependence on an\noligopoly of centralized firms (and to be under the thumb of tech and finance\nbillionaires) then so be it.\n\nThis imagined split between \u2018economic\u2019 and \u2018political\u2019 considerations is\nproblematic on many levels, but it\u2019s hammered into the minds of undergraduates\nin many university economics programmes. Wannabe economists don\u2019t begin their\nanalysis by imagining people formed within tangled webs of culture and\npolitics. Rather, they open their introductory textbooks and are faced with an\nimage of \u2018units\u2019 - discrete and self-contained agents - who seek to get the\nmost from the least.\n\nEven nuanced economists will have been exposed to this idea of the economy as\na collection of independent units who seek out the most efficient and\n\u2018rational\u2019 way to maximize their utility. It\u2019s not that these economists are\nunable to recognise political, cultural, and even \u2018irrational\u2019, weird and\ncreative aspects of society. It\u2019s that economic analysis requires them to\nstrip those away from multi-dimensional issues in order to isolate an imagined\neconomic essence. This is revealed in statements like \u2018I can\u2019t explain the\npolitics of this, but I can explain the economics\u2019.\n\nThis illusory split gets particularly problematic in the monetary realm. Econ\ngraduates are trained to see money as a purely \u2018economic\u2019 phenomenon, rather\nthan a political one. To this end, they\u2019re fed an abstract account of money as\nan apolitical commodity subject to natural market evolution, as if it were a\nproduct on a market, rather than a deeply political structure that underpins\nmarkets. Rather than meditating on how this market-underpinning foundation is\nlaid down and maintained, they treat it as if it were just another commodity\nand try to apply market logic to understand it (which, incidentally, is why\neconomists love creating \u2018evolution of money\u2019 stories in which they fantasize\na trajectory from barter to shells to metals to cash to credit cards).\n\nAltered States of Monetary Consciousness is a reader-supported publication. To\nreceive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid\nsubscriber.\n\nThis mental glitch, in which money is seen as a product rather than a\nfoundation, wreaks havoc when trying to understand the case of cashless\nsociety. I remember the blank look on the face of an award-winning economist\nwhen I explained to him that the move towards \u2018cashlessness\u2019 is heavily pushed\nby the banking sector, which fights dirty for the ascendency of its digital\ncasino chips (the so-called \u2018deposits\u2019 that we see our bank accounts - see The\nDeposit Myth). I suggested to him that, ironically, the attack on cash weakens\nthe structural integrity of the monetary foundation that these banks\nthemselves depend on. He didn\u2019t get it. Not only was he unaware of the fact\nthat banks issue their own casino-chip money, but he couldn\u2019t grasp why this\nmight be important. The only relevant fact to him was that the digital\npayments they facilitated were \u2018efficient and convenient\u2019, and were thereby a\nsuperior product. In the economics worldview, trying to go against that is\nlike trying to stop water running down a hill.\n\n###\n\nThe force in market forces\n\nLet\u2019s take a detour into that metaphor above. Water is pulled down a hill by\ngravity, and it\u2019s not like water chooses or desires this. When we move towards\nthings, however, economists tend to assume that it must stem from an internal\nand independent desire within us, which pushes us towards the thing. This\nbecomes a foundational vibe in their analysis. For example, when our desires\nhit against constraints, they\u2019re supposed to be resolved by \u2018market forces\u2019\nthat will generate signals that guide society down some optimal path to get\nthe most from the least. This feeds into dominant progress narratives, in\nwhich desire-driven economic agents accumulate more and more stuff and carry\nsociety to a new \u2018high score\u2019 (see Money as Addiction).\n\nBut if Economics is synonymous with \u2018market forces\u2019, many conventional\neconomists seem reluctant to fully embrace the implications of that word\n\u2018force\u2019. We\u2019re certainly tied up in large-scale markets, but what if those\nmarkets subjected us to forceful forms of \u2018gravity\u2019 that could override - or\ncondition - our internal desires, and pull us towards paths of least\nresistance? Rather than being independent units, we\u2019re all caught in\ninterdependent webs, and nowadays those webs have been massively scaled-up to\nthe point where their default settings easily overcome, and mould, our\nindividual desires.\n\nThe primary default setting is to expand and accelerate, and going against\nthis path can feel like being a water molecule trying to move uphill. This is\nwhy people who find cash totally normal have a growing feeling that the option\nto use it will be taken away from them. They can sense the systemic tendency\npulling everyone towards ever more automation and acceleration, and struggle\nto imagine how they\u2019d move against it. It\u2019s this uphill path that requires\nactive choice, whereas going with the systemic tendency is a passive act of\nreleasing resistance, allowing yourself to be pulled towards the systemic\ndefault.\n\nChoose your path\n\nIn a city like London there are millions of people who remember living with\ndebit cards and apps without feeling any strong necessity to use them all the\ntime. Like social smokers, however, they would experiment with them. After a\nwhile they started to feel the pull getting stronger, and noticed the\nalternative options slowly disappearing, after which it felt inexorable.\nThey\u2019re left with a feeling like that society must have \u2018chose\u2019 that, but\nnobody can remember an exact moment when this shift happened, and they\u2019re\ncurrently in the process of slowly forgetting what it was like before it\nhappened. Many people are vaguely aware of how their neural pathways have been\nrearranged into new circuits of addiction, and now find themselves agitated by\nsituations they previously were not agitated by - like the thought of taking\nout a banknote in a bouji London bar rather than simply tapping their card. At\nsome level they understand that they\u2019re stuck in a vast web that will\nliterally break them if they refuse to \u2018choose\u2019 the path of increased\nacceleration. If they try to go \u2018uphill\u2019 through acts of actual choice,\nthey\u2019ll be increasingly blocked. This imminent blocking is why we find so many\nstories expressing concern about those who\u2019ll be \u2018left behind\u2019 by cashless\nsociety...\n\nSo, asking when Londoners\u2019 chose to transition to bank-dominated digital\npayments is misleading, because they were slowly sucked into them. All of this\nis missed by (unnuanced) economists, because the \u2018units\u2019 in their textbooks\nstart life in some gravity-free world, sheltered from systemic forces,\ncultural conditioning, peer pressure, or hegemony (where the interests of a\nruling elite seep into our souls as \u2018common sense\u2019). So, when they see a man\ntapping his ApplePay, they see an act of desire and choice. They don\u2019t see a\nman sliding into a new state of accelerated addiction after his brain has been\nhacked by endless nudging amidst decades of bank lobbying and shut-downs of\nthe cash infrastructure. They won\u2019t recognise that he\u2019ll increasingly be\npunished and feel \u2018out of sync\u2019 if he doesn\u2019t move in this direction. They\u2019ll\nimagine he\u2019s stepping forward into the future, rather than slumping into\nconformity.\n\nShare\n\nThis slumping is now easily visible on plane flights. A few years ago it was\ncommon for people to take out cash in an act of choice, but EasyJet executives\n- and all the other airline execs - decided in boardrooms to take that choice\naway. Those were political acts imposed from above, and those acts of blocking\ncreate shame that transmits like a cultural virus. People have now rearranged\ntheir behaviour to avoid it. They literally learn to have their cards at the\nready, after which they come to expect it, and - once addicted - want it. This\nis easy to observe if you have anthropologist eyes, rather than economist\ngoggles. Just visit a place where cash is considered normal. The people don\u2019t\nperceive any inconvenience, because they\u2019ve not yet learned to feel shame\nabout cash.\n\nThis is not unique to cash. This same phenomenon occurs with all automation\nprocesses in our economy. A few years ago we barely noticed the absence of AI,\nbut right now all of us are in the process of learning to want, or at least\nexpect it. We\u2019re at the beginning phase of new slumping process, and at some\npoint you\u2019ll be forced to sink into dependence on it. Conventional economists\nfrequently just ignore the econo-political-cultural forces that can create\nthis \u2018gravity\u2019, and this approach gets spun by the fintech industry. They\ndripfeed us a powerful ideology that says automation is pushed by our desire,\nbut is also unstoppable, and thereby completely indifferent in our desire\n(don\u2019t get left behind!).\n\nFintech firms like the German digital bank N26 will present themselves as\ninnovators serving this transition, but also as efficiency-mongers reducing\ncost to society. This takes us back to their story of cash being an\ninefficient and old-school \u2018horsecart\u2019 exerting a costly drag on the economy.\n\n###\n\nThe \u2018cost of cash\u2019, and the cost of stairs\n\nIn the piece above, N26 propagandists lay down a range of costs that the cash\nhorsecart supposedly exerts on our society. They\u2019re not alone in doing this.\nIt\u2019s common for fintech players to raise concern about the \u2018cost of cash\u2019.\nThese costs include the cost of printing it (incurred by money issuers), the\ncost of banking it, insuring it, moving it around, and the time taken to do\nreconciliation (incurred by businesses). They harp on about the hassle of\nusing it, the time taken to go to ATMs, and the interest not earned by not\nusing bank accounts. They set that against their digital systems, and invoke\nthe illusory mantra that technology saves you time, rather than simply\naccelerating your life (see Tech doesn\u2019t make our lives easier. It makes them\nfaster).\n\nOne of the reasons why the propaganda works is that it plays into existing\nweaknesses in economic literacy. An economy is a interdependent web of people\nwho draw from the earth, but nowadays that takes the form of a giant\ntransnational mesh structure underpinned by state legal systems and multi-\ntiered monetary systems. Modern corporate capitalism is actually a vast\nnetwork vortex, with sub-vortices.\n\nRather than experiencing all the underlying connections within this vortex-of-\nvortexes, a person will experience themselves like a disconnected atom moving\nfrom one market to the next. At one point they\u2019re a consumer in the goods\nmarket, the next an employee in the job market, and the next an investor in\nthe financial market. In each of these spaces they\u2019re but one tiny node, and\nrather than recognizing the interlocking nature of the markets they pass\nthrough, they experience themselves like a blindfolded person moving around an\nelephant, imagining each part they touch to be a unique object.\n\nWhen someone is immersed in a huge system that\u2019s too large to see, it\u2019s easy\nto get them to fixate on the \u2018phenomenological\u2019 elements directly in front of\nthem, rather than the reality beyond their perception. The interlocking\nmarkets of corporate capitalism are held together by monetary systems, but\nmany people casually adopt the economics view of money as some kind of\nmysterious special commodity. We often fixate upon on monetary cost, the\namount of monetary credits handed over to get something in an act of exchange,\nwhile not noticing that the most primal cost of something is a real resource\ncost - the amount of human energy and natural resources that go into bringing\nit to life through an act of production. A monetary cost is one leg of an\nexchange, and the other is a real good or service which exacted a real\nresource cost on its producers, and which is the actual thing that\n(theoretically at least) gives us some benefit. The good or service gets used\nup, but money doesn\u2019t. Once handed over, the money will continue on an onward\npath that may fork and make its way back to you somewhere else in the multi-\ndimensional vortex (or will be pulled out of circulation by its issuers).\n\nFintech propagandists, though, can mobilize misunderstandings about this\nstructure to their advantage in at least three ways:\n\n  1. A modern money system is actually an ecosystem of issuers issuing money in multiple forms in multiple layers, and cash is one component of a balanced monetary foundation. Fintech firms, though, will use the economist idea of money as a series of evolving products, and imagine that \u2018money\u2019 will be upgraded if it lapses into one form (somewhat like imagining transport to be \u2018upgraded\u2019 if we got rid of bicycles and trains, and relied solely on Uber)\n\n  2. They place their audience into the position of the blindfolded person feeling the elephant, and get them to fixate on an imagined cost that cash brings to each section (e.g. the investor loses returns by holding cash, the consumer finds it inconvenient, the manager finds it hard to account for, the shareholder loses profits etc.)\n\n  3. They\u2019ll suggest these \u2018costs of cash\u2019 are one-way losses without benefits, and then add them up into some total cost to society from this defunct product\n\nLet\u2019s take an example from the N26 article, where they claim that:\n\n> Cash needs to be printed, continually inspected and then transported to and\n> secured in safes. That costs the German economy over \u20ac10 billion each year.\n\nThey\u2019re trying to imply that the \u20ac10 billion is like a gas lost to space, but\nthose monetary costs will appear on a bunch of income statements somewhere\nelse as income earned from providing a service, and will turn up in GDP\nfigures. Indeed, everything that turns up in GDP \u2018costs\u2019 one party money, and\nanother party real resources, but we tend to assume there\u2019s also a reverse\nflow of benefit to these costs. Indeed, things often incur a higher monetary\ncost if they\u2019re valuable. High quality jeans cost more than cheap shirts\nbecause they're better. Similarly, a monetary system with cash is a more\nresilient, balanced and inclusive monetary system, which is better. Of course\nthere's a real resource cost to producing jeans, and to maintaining the cash\nsystem, but there's also a real resource cost to maintaining an army, a\nlogistics system, or stairs in a skyscraper. Sometimes we use resources for\nvalid reasons.\n\nThe best way to understand our N26 propagandist is to see them like an\nelevator salesperson spinning stories about the wonderous innovation and\nefficiency of their automated solution, while casting stairs as a wasteful and\ncostly use of resources. I could imagine an ancient Pharoah ordering the\ncreation of a collossal pyramid of gold-encrusted stairs in a wanton act of\nwastefulness, but - on average - our use of real resources for stairs is\ntotally valid. While the elevator evangelist harps on about the exertion\nrequired to walk up them, fitness instructors would see that as a benefit.\nMoreover, the costs of stairs can prevent far more serious \u2018social costs\u2019,\nlike people getting trapped in a building when it\u2019s burning down.\n\nAn elevator salesperson would undoubtedly draw attention to people tripping\ndown stairs and breaking their leg, much like our fintech propagandists who do\neverything they can to draw attention to social costs of cash. In the N26\npiece they highlight \u2018all the illegal activity in Germany associated with\ncash\u2019, and the \u2018astronomical sums of cash\u2019 that are lost or stolen. They\nignore the fact that digital systems are constantly used for cybercrime,\nhacking, extortion and tax avoidance (ahem, the entire offshore tax system is\nfacilitated via digital bank accounts), but the \u2018cash as crime\u2019 line is a\nmajor tool in the anti-cash lobby\u2019s arsenal.\n\nThe figurehead for this is none other than Bj\u00f6rn from ABBA, who has been\nspearheading a campaign against cash ever since his son\u2019s apartment got\nburgled in 2008. Nobody was harmed in this incident, but Bj\u00f6rn was evidently\noutraged, because it led to him becoming Sweden\u2019s foremost proponent of\ngetting rid of cash entirely. He laid out this challenge in \u2018cost vs. benefit\u2019\nterms:\n\nIt\u2019s a classic case of non-holistic and non-systemic thinking, because in\nfocussing on the trauma that could emerge when cash is around, Bj\u00f6rn fails to\nreflect on all the trauma that could emerge when it isn\u2019t. He isn\u2019t\nparticularly interested in the trauma stemming from payments surveillance, or\nthe trauma experienced by those shut out by authoritarian states who can turn\noff their ability to survive by blocking their digital payments. He\u2019s not\nparticularly fussed by the humiliation and discrimination people face for\nlacking the means - or desire - to use digital infrastructures. He\u2019s not\ninterested in the deaths that could result from digital systems meltdown, or\nthe life savings lost to hacked digital accounts, or the elderly person in\nSouth Africa being flustered by a smooth-talking con-man into giving out\ndigital bank details via a phone call or email scam (or at gunpoint in their\nhome). He\u2019s not interested in the fact that platforms harvest our data -\nincluding payments data - to segment, isolate and manipulate us, a factor that\nis leading to increased political disorientation and polarization. Hell, for\nall he knows, that disorientation increases our chances of war.\n\nBut he is very angry about his son being burgled, so much so that he wants\nyour kids to be securely tethered into Big Finance-Tech for the rest of their\nlives, and to have to hand over fees to MasterCard and the banking sector to\ndo even the simplest things like selling lemonade on the street. He doesn\u2019t\ncare about the fact that their future will be one in which digital corporates\ndominate over the political system. He\u2019s indifferent to the fact that the same\nbanks that control the digital payments system also did things like cause the\n2008 Financial Crisis, which destroyed the livelihoods of millions of people,\nand indirectly led to the deaths of who knows how many.\n\nIn fact, Bj\u00f6rn actively embraces this state of corporate domination as modern.\nHere he is, quoted in a Wired piece from 2016:\n\nBj\u00f6rn, of course, is so in touch, because he\u2019s a guy with $300 million who\ncites Bill Gates as the person he admires most, and who believes it\u2019s self-\napparent that progress means yoking ourselves into a Big Tech complex designed\nto extract data and fees. Let\u2019s be blunt. ABBA produced some good tunes, but\nthey were never exactly... political.\n\n###\n\nGetting real about real costs\n\nThere are real costs to cash, but those comes with real benefits, the absence\nof which can bring real social costs, which are really just real losses to our\nwellbeing. Monetary costs, real resource costs, and social costs are not the\nsame, albeit there are complex interconnections between them.\n\nThe shallow rhetoric of the fintech industry does no justice to these subtle\nconcepts, and shows ignorance of the actual monetary system. The actual\nmonetary system is a politically anchored multi-layered web of IOUs, in\ndifferent forms, that holds the so-called economic realm together. Analysing\nthe separate elements of that foundation as if they were free-floating\ncommodities subject to monetary cost considerations (that the foundation\nitself underpins) is delusional on multiple fronts. Not only does the\nfoundation get weakened if you remove cash, but we incur all those social\nlosses: exclusion, centralization of power in too-big-to-fail oligopolies,\ninequality that stems from centralization, data extraction used to\ndisorientate us, and acceleration that raises our bloodpressure. We can have a\ndebate about the relative severity of these \u2018political\u2019 losses, but never let\nthe fintech industry tell you these are side issues. Money is political, and\nthat\u2019s the starting point of the economics of cash.\n\nThanks for reading. If you enjoyed this, consider upgrading to the paid\nsubscription.
