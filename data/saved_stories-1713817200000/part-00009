Write your manuscript in markdown, track it with git,\nautomatically convert it to .html, .pdf, or .docx, and deploy it to your\ndestination of choice.\n\nGet Started On GitHub\n\n### How It Works\n\ninput markdownprocess w/ Manubot tools and Pandocoutput .html, .pdf, .docxtest\nand deploy\n\n### The Best Parts\n\n#### Open, collaborative, versioned\n\nAuthor your manuscript the open-source way. Let anyone propose changes.\nIteratively review, discuss, and refine with collaborators. Coordinate teams\nof any size with ease. Keep track of versions, to-dos, revisions, and who\nwrote what and when. All in a central location.\n\n#### Automated and continuous\n\nNever use a reference manager again. Provide a DOI, ISBN, PubMed ID, URL,\netc., and let Manubot generate and number citations for you. Choose from\nthousands of existing citation styles. See your manuscript update right away\nas you make changes. Test and deploy automatically with continuous\nintegration.\n\n#### Beautiful and interactive\n\nStatic is out, dynamic is in. The contemporary look and interactive features\npeople have come to love and expect from modern webpages, now applied to\nscholarly articles: tooltips, public annotations, table of contents, figure\nviewer, and more.\n\n#### Free and open-source\n\nThere's no need to pay to produce brilliant manuscripts. Manubot is free and\nopen-source (aside from optional workflow integration with GitHub and Travis\nCI). Its tools are developed and supported by a community of responsive and\npassionate software developers and researchers.\n\n### Made With Manubot\n\nAnalysis of science journalism reveals gender and regional disparities in\ncoverage\n\nSARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19: An Evolving Review of Diagnostics and Therapeutics\n\nMorphofunctional changes at the active zone during synaptic vesicle exocytosis\n\nExpanding a Database-derived Biomedical Knowledge Graph via Multi-relation\nExtraction from Biomedical Abstracts\n\nThe LOTUS Initiative for Open Knowledge Management in Natural Products\nResearch\n\nOpportunities and obstacles for deep learning in biology and medicine [update\nin progress]\n\nAnalysis of scientific society-awarded honors reveals disparities\n\nDes illusions visuelles aux hallucinations: une porte sur la perception\n\nIncorporating biological structure into machine learning models in biomedicine\n\nBinding thermodynamics of host-guest systems with SMIRNOFF99Frosst 1.0.5 from\nthe Open Force Field Initiative\n\nSci-Hub provides access to nearly all scholarly literature\n\nIntroducing yt 4.0: Analysis and Visualization of Volumetric Data\n\nAutomated segmentation and description of the internal morphology of human\npermanent teeth by means of micro-CT\n\nTen Quick Tips for Deep Learning in Biology\n\nsPlotOpen \u2013 An environmentally-balanced, open-access, global dataset of\nvegetation plots\n\nANN: A platform to annotate text with Wikidata IDs\n\ntreeheatr: an R package for interpretable decision tree visualizations\n\nComparative analyses of two primate species diverged by more than 60 million\nyears show different rates but similar distribution of genome-wide UV repair\nevents\n\nExpanding polygenic risk scores to include automatic genotype encodings and\ngene-gene interactions\n\nScaling tree-based automated machine learning to biomedical big data with a\nfeature set selector\n\nPlasmids for independently tunable, low-noise expression of two genes\n\nEdit me to practice contributing to a collaborative Manubot manuscript\n\nWidespread redundancy in -omics profiles of cancer mutation states\n\nIRB Protocol: Understanding Black Indianapolis Community Members\u2019 Vision for\nHousing in their Neighborhoods\n\nExtension of Roles in the ChEBI Ontology\n\nOpen collaborative writing with Manubot\n\nCollaborative Writing with Manubot\n\nSci-Hub proporciona acceso a casi toda la literatura acad\u00e9mica\n\nSystematic integration of biomedical knowledge prioritizes drugs for\nrepurposing\n\nThe probability of edge existence due to node degree: a baseline for network-\nbased predictions\n\nFormes & perception\n\nHetnet connectivity search provides rapid insights into how two biomedical\nentities are related\n\nIntegrative Analytical and Computational Strategies for Qualitative and Semi-\nquantitative Plant Metabolome Characterization\n\nPackaging research artefacts with RO-Crate\n\nTowards a pragmatic definition of cell type\n\nFrom the retina to action: Dynamics of predictive processing in the visual\nsystem\n\nReproducible, portable, and efficient ancient genome reconstruction with nf-\ncore/eager\n\nGenotyping structural variants in pangenome graphs using the vg toolkit\n\nThe people of the 24th annual Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing in Hawaii\n\nTwo real use cases of FAIR maturity indicators in the life sciences\n\nBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\n\nCatalog\n\n### Our Philosophy\n\nManuscripts are the primary basis of scholarly communication, yet the process\nof creating them has not kept in step with the advancement of technology or\nthe evolving best-practices of science.\n\nTraditionally, authoring of manuscripts takes place in a closed manner. While\nmost scientific material is eventually distributed to some kind of public\nmedium, the process of developing and reviewing the material is usually done\nin private, contained to a handful of individuals. The tools used are often\noutmoded, restrictive, and overall poorly-suited for the task of\ncollaborative, scientific writing. The time it takes to review and publish can\nbe unreasonably long.\n\nWe believe that this process is antiquated and must be reformed. Good science\ndepends upon many things that the conventional approach doesn't provide: A\ndiversity of input and perspectives. Spontaneous and cross-discipline\ncontributions. Organic and wide-spread discovery and dissemination of\nknowledge. The fostering of a free, global information commons. A method of\nreal-time, continuous science, performed entirely in the open.\n\nCurrent technology easily affords huge advantages over the old way of doing\nthings, both in convenience and in the quality of the result. Manubot is a\nsolution to the past and a push towards a future ideal, where scientific\nwriting is transparent, reproducible, immediate, permissionless, versioned,\nautomated, collaborative, open, linked, provenanced, decentralized, hackable,\ninteractive, annotated, and free of charge.\n\n### Cite Manubot\n\nTo reference the Manubot project, you can cite the following software paper\n(AKA the \"Meta Review\") describing the functionality and benefits of Manubot:\n\nOpen collaborative writing with Manubot Daniel S.
