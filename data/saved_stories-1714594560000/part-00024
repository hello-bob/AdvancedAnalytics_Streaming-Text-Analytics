Expect bugs and changes. Do\nnot use it as the only way to store your photos and videos!\n\n# The Immich core team goes full-time\n\nMay 1, 2024 \u00b7 4 min read\n\nAlex Tran\n\nMaintainer of Immich\n\nImmich is joining FUTO!\n\nSince the beginning of this adventure, my goal has always been to create a\nbetter world for my children. Memories are priceless, and privacy should not\nbe a luxury. However, building quality open source has its challenges. Over\nthe past two years, it has taken significant dedication, time, and effort.\n\nRecently, a company in Austin, Texas, called FUTO contacted the team. FUTO\nstrives to develop quality and sustainable open software. They build software\nalternatives that focus on giving control to users. From their mission\nstatement:\n\n\u201cComputers should belong to you, the people. We develop and fund technology to\ngive them back.\u201d\n\nFUTO loved Immich and wanted to see if we\u2019d consider working with them to take\nthe project to the next level. In short, FUTO offered to:\n\n  * Pay the core team to work on Immich full-time\n  * Let us keep full autonomy about the project\u2019s direction and leadership\n  * Continue to license Immich under AGPL\n  * Keep Immich\u2019s development direction with no paywalled features\n  * Keep Immich \u201cbuilt for the people\u201d (no ads, data mining/selling, or alternative motives)\n  * Provide us with financial, technical, legal, and administrative support\n\nAfter careful deliberation, the team decided that FUTO\u2019s vision closely aligns\nwith our own: to build a better future by providing a polished, performant,\nand privacy-preserving open-source software solution for photo and video\nmanagement delivered in a sustainable way.\n\nImmich\u2019s future has never looked brighter, and we look forward to realizing\nour vision for Immich as part of FUTO.\n\nIf you have more questions, we\u2019ll host a Q&A live stream on May 9th at 3PM UTC\n(10AM CST). You can ask questions here, and the stream will be live here on\nour YouTube channel.\n\nCheers,\n\nThe Immich Team\n\n## FAQs\n\n### What is FUTO?\n\nhttps://futo.org/what-is-futo/\n\n### Will the license change?\n\nNo. Immich will continue to be licensed under AGPL without a CLA.\n\n### Will Immich continue to be free?\n\nYes. The Immich source code will remain freely available under the AGPL\nlicense.\n\n### Is Immich getting VC funding?\n\nNo. Venture capital implies investment in a business, often with the\nexpectation of a future payout (exit plan). Immich is neither a business that\ncan be acquired nor comes with a money-making exit plan.\n\n### I am currently supporting Immich through GitHub sponsors. What will happen\nto my donation?\n\nEffective immediately, all donations to the Immich organization will be\ncanceled. In the future, we will offer an optional, modest payment option\ninstead. Thank you to everyone who donated to help us get this far!\n\n### How is funding sustainable?\n\nImmich and FUTO believe a sustainable future requires a model that does not\nrely on users-as-a-product. To this end, FUTO advocates that users pay for\ngood, open software. In keeping with this model, we will adopt a purchase\nprice. This means we no longer accept donations, but \u2014 without limiting\nfeatures for those who do not pay \u2014 we will soon allow you to purchase Immich\nthrough a modest payment. We encourage you to pay for the high-quality\nsoftware you use to foster a healthy software culture where developers build\ngreat applications without hidden motives for their users.\n\n### When does this change take effect?\n\nThis change takes effect immediately.\n\n### What will change?\n\nThe following things will change as Immich joins FUTO:\n\n  * The brand, logo, and other Immich trademarks will be transferred to FUTO.\n  * We will stop all donations to the project.\n  * The core team can now dedicate our full attention to Immich\n  * Before the end of the year, we plan to have a roadmap for what it will take to get Immich to a stable release.\n  * Bugs will be squashed, and features will be delivered faster.\n\nTags:\n\n  * update\n  * announcement\n  * futo\n\n  * FAQs\n\n    * What is FUTO?\n    * Will the license change?\n    * Will Immich continue to be free?\n    * Is Immich getting VC funding?\n    * I am currently supporting Immich through GitHub sponsors.
