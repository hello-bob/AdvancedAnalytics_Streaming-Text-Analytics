This week, we\u2019ll cover how to compile and run a simple command line\nARM Assembly Language Hello World program.\n\n# Thanks to Alex vonBelow\n\nMy book \u201cProgramming with 64-Bit ARM Assembly Language\u201d contains lots of\nsample self contained Assembly Language programs and a number of iOS and\nAndroid samples. The command line utilities are compiled for Linux using the\nGNU tool set. Alex vonBelow took all of these and modified them to work with\nthe LLVM tool chain and to work within Apple\u2019s development environment. He\ndealt with all the differences between Linux and MacOS/iOS as well. His\nversion of the source code for my book, but modified for Apple M1 is available\nhere:\n\nhttps://github.com/below/HelloSilicon.\n\n# Differences Between MacOS and Linux\n\nBoth MacOS and Linux are based on Unix and are more similar than different.\nHowever there are a few differences of note:\n\n  * MacOS uses LLVM by default whereas Linux uses GNU GCC. This really just affects the command line arguments in the makefile for the purposes of this article. You can use LLVM on Linux and GCC should be available for Apple M1 shortly.\n  * The MacOS linker/loader doesn\u2019t like doing relocations, so you need to use the ADR rather than LDR instruction to load addresses. You could use ADR in Linux and if you do this it will work in both.\n  * The Unix API calls are nearly the same, the difference is that Linux redid the function numbers when they went to 64-bit, but MacOS kept the function numbers the same. In the 32-bit world they were the same, but now they are all different.\n  * When calling a Linux service the function number goes in X16 rather than X8.\n  * Linux installs the various libraries and includes files under /usr/lib and /usr/include, so they are easy to find and use. When you install XCode, it installs SDKs for MacOS, iOS, iPadOS, iWatchOS, etc. with the option of installing lots for versions. The paths to the libs and includes are rather complicated and you need a tool to find them.\n  * In MacOS the program must start on a 64-bit boundary, hence the listing has an \u201c.align 2\u201d directive near top.\n  * In MacOS you need to link in the System library even if you don\u2019t make a system call from it or you get a linker error. This sample Hello World program uses software interrupts to make the system calls rather than the API in the System library and so shouldn\u2019t need to link to it.\n  * In MacOS the default entry point is _main whereas in Linux it is _start. This is changed via a command line argument to the linker.\n\n# Hello World Assembly File\n\nBelow is the simple Assembly Language program to print out \u201cHello World\u201d in a\nterminal window. For all the gory details on these instructions and the\narchitecture of the ARM processor, check out my book.\n\n    \n    \n    // // Assembler program to print \"Hello World!\" // to stdout. // // X0-X2 - parameters to linux function services // X16 - linux function number // .global _start // Provide program starting address to linker .align 2\n    \n    // Setup the parameters to print hello world // and then call Linux to do it.\n    \n    _start: mov X0, #1 // 1 = StdOut adr X1, helloworld // string to print mov X2, #13 // length of our string mov X16, #4 // MacOS write system call svc 0 // Call linux to output the string\n    \n    // Setup the parameters to exit the program // and then call Linux to do it.\n    \n    mov X0, #0 // Use 0 return code mov X16, #1 // Service command code 1 terminates this program svc 0 // Call MacOS to terminate the program\n    \n    helloworld: .ascii \"Hello World!\\n\"\n\n# Makefile\n\nHere is the makefile, the command to assemble the source code is simple, then\nthe command to link is a bit more complicated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\n    \n    \n    HelloWorld: HelloWorld.o ld -macosx_version_min 11.0.0 -o HelloWorld HelloWorld.o -lSystem -syslibroot `xcrun -sdk macosx --show-sdk-path` -e _start -arch arm64\n    \n    HelloWorld.o: HelloWorld.s as -o HelloWorld.o HelloWorld.s\n\nThe xcrun command is Apple\u2019s command to run or find the various SDKs.

LLVM is a\nstandard open source development tool which contains an Assembler that is\nsimilar to the GNU Assembler. Programming MacOS is similar to Linux since both\nare based on Unix and if you are familiar with Linux, most of your knowledge\nis directly applicable.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Reddit\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nApple Mac ARM M1 Competitive Trade-offsNovember 13, 2020In \"Business\"\n\nApple M1 as a Development WorkstationJanuary 1, 2021In \"Business\"\n\nPorting Linux to Apple SiliconJanuary 15, 2021In \"assembly language\"\n\nWritten by smist08\n\nJanuary 8, 2021 at 10:31 am\n\nPosted in assembly language\n\nTagged with Apple, apple m1, arm, arm assembler, assembly language\n\n\u00ab Apple M1 as a Development Workstation\n\nPorting Linux to Apple Silicon \u00bb\n\n### 19 Responses\n\nSubscribe to comments with RSS.\n\n  1.

In the code listing, the comment states \u201cService command code 93 terminates this program\u201d but the actual code uses #1.

Hey Stephen,\n\nCould you explain why you replaced \u201cldr X1, =helloworld\u201d with \u201cadr X1,\nhelloworld\u201d in this example? I am aware that this is necessary on M1 Mac, but\nwondering about broader justification of this.\n\nThanks.\n\nkaturek\n\nApril 15, 2021 at 8:10 am\n\nReply\n\n     * I believe its because Apple chose to not have their program loader support relocations. As a result perhaps they can load programs a bit faster by not having to fix up a bunch of addresses. Remember LDR places the address of helloworld in memory and then loads that with a PC relative address and this memory address needs to be fixed when the program loads.\n\nsmist08\n\nApril 15, 2021 at 3:41 pm\n\nReply\n\n       * You can make the linker optimize the relocations for you with .loh markup in the assembly\n\nWibble\n\nFebruary 6, 2022 at 4:15 pm\n\n  10.

Hi, I\u2019ve compiled/linked the \u201chello world\u201d assembly on a Mac running the M2 pro chip and it prints to the console as you would expect, but then prints \u201csegmentation fault\u201d on the next line, which seems strange. If I do the same on a M1 Mac, it works fine.\n\nStephen Rice\n\nNovember 15, 2023 at 12:43 am\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
