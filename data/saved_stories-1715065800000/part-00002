If you chose to\nuse it, UE would step through the friends you have on Facebook and the Pages\nyou follow, and, well, unfollow all of them. This would render your Facebook\nfeed either empty, or uselessly filled with spammy recommendations. One way or\nanother, Barclay reasoned, you\u2019d probably use Facebook less, and use it the\nway you might have before 2005 \u2013 going to a friend\u2019s page and seeing their\nupdates.\n\nMeta wasn\u2019t a fan of Louis\u2019s work. They banned him for life from their\nplatforms and demanded he cease and desist distributing his tool. I asked the\ncourt whether I could build a new, up-to-date version of UE (Unfollow\nEverything 2.0), with more privacy preserving features, and do an opt-in study\nwhere participants could see whether using UE2 reduced their use of Facebook,\nincreased their sense of control over Facebook, and increased or reduced the\ndiversity of the people they interacted with.\n\nBecause Meta prevented Louis from distributing UE, we think it\u2019s reasonable to\nask a court to rule on whether we can release a very similar tool. We believe\nwe can, based on our reading on section 230 of the Communications Decency Act,\nspecifically section (c)(2)(B), which states that it is the policy of the\nUnited States \u201cto encourage the development of technologies which maximize\nuser control over what information is received by individuals, families, and\nschools who use the Internet and other interactive computer services\u201d. If a\ncourt agrees, we think this may open up a channel for developing a category of\nsoftware that Francis Fukuyama and friends call \u201cmiddleware\u201d, software users\ncan install to have greater control over their social media experience.\n\n(Alex Abdo just posted a Twitter thread that offers a more detailed overview\nof the case and our legal strategies.)\n\nI\u2019ll be sharing more writing about my motivations behind this suit in the next\ncouple of days. In the meantime, I\u2019m really enjoying watching smart people\ntalk about whether they think this suit could work.\n\nWriting for Wired, Vittoria Elliott talks to a wide variety of legal experts,\nwho have a range of views on whether this could work. Barbara Ortutay, writing\nfor AP, focuses on the idea that we might want more control over our social\nmedia than we currently have.\n\nThe stuff that\u2019s been the most fun for me is watching friends and colleagues\nwho follow internet law closely reflect on our arguments and their\nimplications. Daphne Keller notes that we manage to raise issues all over the\nworld of internet law, from section 230 to DMCA 1201. Cory Doctorow connects\nour work to the idea of adversarial interoperability, the idea that technology\nprogresses when we can interoperate with existing systems whether their owners\nlike it or not. And Mike Masnick has a funny and insightful post about how the\nnovelty of our legal argument is throwing some legal experts for a loop.\n\nI will be writing more about this topic, but some quick notes/disclaimers for\nnow:\n\n\u2013 While I get to have my name on the suit, the work here has been done by\nRamya Krishnan, Alex Abdo and their colleagues at K1A, and by Louis Barclay,\nwho conceived of and built UE in the first place.\n\n\u2013 I am able to be plaintiff in this suit because I\u2019m lucky enough to be a\ntenured professor at a university that values social change as well as\nresearch. I am acting entirely on my own, and in no way acting on behalf of\nUMass Amherst, but as I\u2019ve let my colleagues, chairs and deans know about what\nI\u2019m doing, they have been uniformly supportive and lovely.\n\nUnfortunately, this is a moment where the US is having a lot of trouble\npassing critical legislation to clarify questions like whether users have a\nright to control their experience of social media. (Instead, we seem to be\nbanning Tiktok.) At moments like this, the courts can be as important as\nlegislatures for shaping policy. If you, like me, are in the privileged\nposition of being able to be part of a case like this, I\u2019d urge you to do so.\n\n\u2013 Mike Masnick describes this suit as \u201cZuck vs. Zuck\u201d. Fair enough. But I\npronounce my name \u201cZOOK er man\u201d and he pronounces his \u201cZUCK er berg\u201d. So as\nlong as you think of it as \u201cZOOK vs. ZUCK\u201d, it\u2019s fine by me.\n\n### Leave a Reply\n\nRecent Posts\n\n  * Zuckerman vs. Meta Platforms\n  * Twitter\u2019s New Business Model: Russian Disinfo\n  * Pablo Boczkowski on the crisis in the \u201cmental health capital of the world\u201d\n  * How Big is YouTube?\n  * Disinfo and Elections in the Global Majority\n\nGreatest Hits\n\n  * Cute Cats to the Rescue?
