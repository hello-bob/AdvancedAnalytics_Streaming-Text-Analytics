The first is an\nabsolute conviction in the importance of your work, the shivery sense that you\nhave been called to the language in some spiritual capacity, that you (and you\nalone) have stories the world must hear, that these stories are ready to spill\nout of you with the hot urgency of scripture and that when they do you will be\nrecognized as a rare talent, a writer of the first order and eventually\u2014why\nfight it?\u2014the Messiah.\n\nYou are not the Messiah.\n\nBut this mindset is generative in nature. It tends to produce a lot of work,\neven if this same work later makes you cringe.\n\nThe second force is the creeping suspicion that any sustained effort to write\nis doomed, that you will never transcribe the story so perfectly arranged in\nyour mind, will never convey the insight and depth of emotion sloshing around\nin there, and that the best result you can hope for is that your mother will\ndrive to your apartment with a Crock-Pot full of soup and ask why you\u2019re\ndepressed.\n\nBad news: you will never rid yourselves of these opposing forces.\n\nGood news: your job is not to make them go away, but to mitigate, and\ntolerate, the fluctuation between them.\n\nIt\u2019s important to consider precisely how these decisions were imperfect,\nwithout succumbing to the opera of self-doubt.\n\nIt will help to take a step back from the keyboard and consider the essential\nnature of the activity. What is writing, if you boil away all the romance?\nWriting is decision-making. Nothing more and nothing less. What word? Where to\nplace the comma? How to shape the paragraph? Which characters to undress and\nin what manner? It\u2019s relentless.\n\nIf you refuse to pass judgment on these decisions, if you walk around thinking\nyou\u2019re the Messiah, you\u2019ll wind up settling for inferior decisions, by which I\nmean imprecise, contrived, solipsistic ones. If, on the other hand, you\ncondemn your decisions, you\u2019ll lose the improvisatory momentum upon which all\nnarrative construction depends.\n\nThe only surefire solution is to develop the capacity to access your decisions\nwithout second-guessing your talent. I believe the most effective way to\nexpand this capacity is to appraise the work of other writers, whose decisions\nyou can see more clearly than your own. The goal is to attain that elusive\nstate in which your decision-making becomes intuitive rather than labored.\n\nThis sounds lovely. But often in the midst of a writing project, in the midst\nof the life surrounding that writing project, the second force takes over, and\nwe are overrun with feelings of dread, helplessness, and self-loathing. The\ntechnical term is Writer\u2019s Block.\n\nAmid the skittish egos of the literary world, Writer\u2019s Block has assumed a\nstatus akin to the Black Plague, an affliction that forces us into quarantine.\nWe just sort of melt from view for a while, off-loading the worst of ourselves\nonto paid help and loyal beloveds.\n\n*\n\nI want to dispel some of the myths about Writer\u2019s Block, and undo the\nmysteries that surround the condition. What\u2019s happening when we feel blocked?\nWhat can we do to find our way back to the keyboard? Can we accept Writer\u2019s\nBlock as a potential ally to our creativity?\n\nThe first thing that needs to be said is that writers get blocked almost\nconstantly. During the composition of this very paragraph, I stopped typing\nthirty-seven times (I counted), stumped as to what I wanted to say next, and\nhow. I got up and made a snack. I went outside to chase away the woodchuck\nliving beneath our storage shed. I came back inside and turned off the app\nthat turns off my internet and spent a solid half hour researching how to\npoison a woodchuck.\n\nI considered what would happen if I poisoned the woodchuck\u2014or worse yet, the\nbaby woodchuck\u2014and my wife found out. I made a bunch of linguistic tweaks,\nmost of which I unmade, before erasing the whole paragraph and starting over.\nAt every phase of this extremely shitty and inefficient process, I was\nsuffering a block, a moment in which doubt and indecision overtook my faith. I\nam still eyeing this paragraph suspiciously.\n\nSo let\u2019s please stop treating Writer\u2019s Block as a binary: either we\u2019re flowing\nor we\u2019re blocked. It\u2019s more precise to say that Writer\u2019s Block is the extreme\nend of a spectrum, where the inhibitive impulses that almost always accompany\nour decisions become debilitating. We feel a futility so potent that we stop\nmaking decisions altogether.\n\nCrazily enough, Writer\u2019s Block is sometimes a symptom of progress. I have a\nlot of students who travel the same arc I did in grad school. They put in long\nhours critiquing the work of their comrades. This sharpens their critical\nfaculty. When they return to their own prose, they are suddenly confronted by\nflaws that had been invisible. It\u2019s brutal.\n\nBut what\u2019s really happening? They\u2019re holding themselves to a higher standard,\ntaking their task more seriously. It can feel like being cast out of Eden. The\nwriter has to leave the paradise of innocence (making decisions free of\njudgment) and face the true nature of her work, the psychological and\nemotional challenges of literary art. Welcome to the big show.\n\n*\n\nI\u2019ve been stalled creatively so many times over the years that it can be hard\nfor me to distinguish between periods of genuine Writer\u2019s Block and eras in\nwhich I\u2019ve managed to avoid deep creative work by focusing on other pursuits,\nsuch as making money or promoting a book or poisoning baby woodchucks. But I\ncertainly remember the worst of my blocks.\n\nBack in 2003, for instance, I fell into a sustained depression. As is often\nthe case, the trigger was a major creative disappointment. Two years earlier,\nI\u2019d published my first book, a collection of short stories. I naturally\nexpected this triumph would banish all the doubt I had ever felt, vanquish my\nrivals, and compel old girlfriends to drunk-dial me in the middle of the\nnight. People would probably also throw money at me as I walked down the\nsidewalk. Instead, the book sold a few hundred copies and my agent told me to\nwrite a novel.\n\nI wrote every day, convinced the book would be a smashing success. My fingers\nwere typing. My characters were gallivanting. From the outside, it looked like\nI was working. Hell, I was working. After two years, I had 850 pages, which I\nsent off to my agent. Several months passed. There is no need to catalogue the\nmultitude of panicky, passive-aggressive emails I composed during this span,\nthough for poetic effect, I would estimate the count at 850 million.\n\nThen came a brief conversation. Less than a minute. My agent had read what she\ncould of the manuscript and felt it would be better for us to part ways. She\nwas right, of course, which didn\u2019t stop me from loathing her.\n\nSoon enough, the hatred burned off and I fell right through the floor. There\nwas no point in writing. About the only thing that got me out of bed during\nthose months was the desire for chocolate. Back then, I was eating in such\nvolume, and on such a meager budget, that I took to buying direct from the\nHaviland Chocolate factory, just a short drive from my apartment in\nSomerville.\n\nThere was a little shop on the first floor that sold seconds, meaning\nchocolates that were, like me, defective in some way. Often the defect was an\nexcess of chocolate coating, or the accidental bonding of two pieces into one.\nI could purchase a two-pound box of mint patties for three dollars and a\nbulging bag of conjoined Clark bars for a buck fifty.\n\nI spent a lot of time in that shop, inhaling chocolate fumes and pondering the\nmiracle of industrial candy production. At a certain point, rent became a\npressing concern. A solution soon presented itself. As an apostate journalist,\nI pitched the local alt weekly a story about Haviland Chocolate.The moment I\nset foot in the factory, my sadness dissolved. The elevators smelled like\nHalloween. Massive copper cauldrons of caramel bubbled. Conveyer belts carried\nmarshmallow bunnies through curtains of shimmering chocolate. I had found a\nworld that awakened my attention and curiosity, that brought me alive again.\n\nI decided I would write a book about candy. I didn\u2019t write a book proposal, I\njust started flying all over the country and bullshitting my way into the\nlittle factories where they made weird regional candy bars like the Idaho Spud\nand the Twin Bing.\n\nWhen the book was done, I sent it out to a bunch of agents, all of whom agreed\nit would never sell. It was too strange. One said he didn\u2019t know where it\nwould be shelved in Borders, which is a lot funnier now than it was at the\ntime. The book was genuinely odd: part ode to candy, part angsty confession,\npart travelogue.\n\nI stuffed the draft in a drawer. I dug it out again only because my writer\nfriends kept asking to read it. Their enthusiasm gave me confidence to send it\nout to a few editors, one of whom bit. But even after Candyfreak was\npublished, I regarded it as a lark. I had failed at the novel and settled for\npop-culture journalism.\n\nI now view the situation more generously: I wrote my way out of a sustained\nblock. This block, in fact, had helped me cast off a certain writerly vanity\nthat was holding me back. Rather than asking, What sort of book should I be\nwriting? I was able to ask a much more useful question: What sort of book do I\nwant to write?\n\nA simpler way of putting it would be this: I lowered the bar.\n\nWhen people ask me how to deal with Writer\u2019s Block, that\u2019s my essential\nadvice: lower the bar. Blocks result from putting too much pressure on\nourselves. Set aside (for now anyway) the big project intended to validate\nyour ego. Focus on what will get you to the keyboard, what feels attainable.\nWrite for twenty minutes. Or ten.\n\nAnd make sure you have friends around, for support and for the reality check.\n\n*\n\nWhat I\u2019m suggesting here isn\u2019t a regimen of bonbon consumption and self-\nadulation, but something more like a temporary reprieve from the hardship of\njudgment. Because judgment leads to insecurity. And all bad decisions at the\nkeyboard arise from insecurity, from little moments of doubt in which our\nattention shifts from the drama of the story in question to the yammering of\nego need.\n\nAs this happens, we stop asking the questions that drive our stories forward:\nWho am I writing about? What do they desire? What endangers them? Can they be\nsaved? We start asking smaller, self-involved questions. Will this metaphor\nimpress the reader? Am I smart enough to pull this off? Funny enough? Deep\nenough?\n\nWe start to perform rather than engage in storytelling. We leap into scene\nwithout context. We overwrite. We orchestrate coincidences and calamities to\ngoose the action.\n\nWhen my students talk about these decisions in workshop, they use language\nthat betrays their insecurity. They talk about how readers will get bored if\nthey reveal too much too soon, as if plot elements should be scattered about\nlike breadcrumbs, to lure the wayward along. They fear readers will deem them\nhistrionic if they dramatize moments of conflict. Or dull if they don\u2019t\nprettify the language. These decisions, which are intended to entice and\nplacate the reader, have the opposite effect. The reader winds up confused and\nthwarted. The writer, encountering this, winds up feeling, well, blocked.\n\nIt\u2019s a negative feedback loop.\n\n*\n\nSo how do we disrupt the loop?\n\nPreviously, I recommended lowering expectations and shifting to a less fraught\nproject. But I know from personal experience that it\u2019s possible to confront\nWriter\u2019s Block more directly.\n\nThe first step is to take a deep breath and recognize that the manuscript\u2019s\nflaws are not an indictment of your talent or your right to tell the story.\nThey are merely a set of imperfect decisions you made at a particular moment.\n\nIt\u2019s important to consider precisely how these decisions were imperfect,\nwithout succumbing to the opera of self-doubt. You have to be able to study\nyour decisions with detachment, to figure out why you made them in the first\nplace.\n\nIf you\u2019re anything like me (bad news: you are), you wanted your writing to\naddress certain primal yearnings. Namely, to be seen, heard, acknowledged,\nunderstood, admired, and\u2014hell, let\u2019s just get to the basement of this\nthing\u2014loved. And you know what? You deserve all of that. Try to resist the\nurge to pathologize these needs or to cast them as weakness. They\u2019re an\nessential part of your engine to create.\n\nIt\u2019s only when these yearnings overpower your creative intentions that they\nundermine your work. Rather than becoming immersed in the world of the\ncharacters and their struggles, the reader continually encounters the writer,\nwho stands in the way of the story, frantically mugging, hoping you will\nadmire his fine manners of thought and feeling.\n\nYour sentences start to betray the doubt you feel about yourself instead of\nexploring the bewilderments that haunt your characters: how to survive the\nsorrows of childhood, say, why we choose the wrong lovers. These are the\nmysteries your readers are struggling to understand. They are turning to you\nnot for answers but solace, the promise that they are not alone in these\nstruggles. If you can dial your ego down, an entire imaginative space opens\nup, into which the muse can willingly enter.\n\nI\u2019m just tired of defining myself by what I can\u2019t do, by some ancient and\nfrankly vain notion of what I\u2019m meant to achieve.\n\nWhat happens in moments of peak creativity should be considered a dividend of\nsublimation. It\u2019s not that we make our feelings go away; we\u2019re able to\ntransmit them to our characters. We summon the courage to lay them bare and\nthe grace to grant them a forgiveness we rarely attain ourselves.\n\nWhen my writing is going well, I fall into a flow state marked by intense\nfocus, imaginative rigor, freedom of association, and psychic momentum. Simply\nput: the story becomes more interesting to me then how well I\u2019m telling it.\nThe ego drama of Am I Good Enough gives way to the larger and more generous\ndrama of whether the heroine will find love, or ruin, and will come to know\nthe truth of herself in the process.\n\nEgoless prose.\n\nThat\u2019s the term a colleague used recently. She was describing the rapture\ninduced when she sensed that 100 percent of the writer\u2019s skill and attention\nwas devoted to her characters.\n\nBut you can be sure the author in question suffered through periods of\nWriter\u2019s Block along the way. She may be suffering through a block right now,\nas you read this. This should not be taken as bad news. It just means that all\ncreative states are temporary. Just because you\u2019re blocked today doesn\u2019t mean\nyou\u2019ll be blocked tomorrow.\n\nFaith is the capacity to hold on to hope amid despair.\n\n*\n\nOne more story from the vault. This one takes place just a few years ago. I\u2019m\nthree-quarters of the way through a novel that feels like the best thing I\u2019ve\nwritten in years. I\u2019ve sent the first hundred pages off to the editor I trust\nmost in the world, and he\u2019s just returned with good news and bad news. He\nthinks it stands a chance. But it needs major revisions.\n\nEver since I received his note, I\u2019ve been waking at 4 a.m., churning with\ndread. My wife lies next to me, drowsily assessing the situation. She knows\nwhat happens next, that I\u2019ll tromp downstairs to my office and stare at the\nscreen for hours, that the hole I\u2019m digging for myself will get deeper.\nThere\u2019s not a lot she can say. She\u2019s a writer, too. I snap at my kids. My\ntherapist recommends an antidepressant. What if I\u2019m not cut out to write a\nnovel, he asks. Would that be so terrible?\n\nBack in my basement, amid the candy wrappers and woodchuck poison, I rewrite\nthe opening of the book. Four times. I\u2019m making decisions, but I don\u2019t believe\nin them. This goes on for months. Then I do something totally out of\ncharacter: I surrender to the possibility my asshole therapist is right\u2014that\nI\u2019ll never write a novel.\n\nNo trumpets blare. I\u2019m just tired of defining myself by what I can\u2019t do, by\nsome ancient and frankly vain notion of what I\u2019m meant to achieve.\n\nWithin a few weeks, I start poking at a story about a young girl growing up in\nthe California of my youth. She\u2019s smart and brave and desperate with yearnings\nthat lure her into danger. Pretty soon the police are involved, then the FBI.\nIt\u2019s not a novel yet, just a story that keeps expanding. Every day, I arrive\nat the keyboard and my heroine is still there, taking risks, pushing her luck.\nI\u2019m so in love with her, so worried about her. For the first time in years,\nI\u2019m writing egoless prose.\n\nI know the block will be back, if it ever even left. There\u2019s nothing shameful\nin any of this. We all go through it. We\u2019re all afraid we will never be worthy\nof love. The fear takes us under for a while. It feels like drowning. But\nwe\u2019re not drowning. We get to breathe.\n\n__________________________________\n\nFrom Truth Is the Arrow, Mercy Is the Bow: A DIY Manual for the Construction\nof Stories by Steve Almond. Copyright \u00a9 2024.
