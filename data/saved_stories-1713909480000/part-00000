Unless you are one of my daughters, in\nwhich case it is your father's webmail. Cypht (pronounced \"sift\") is like a\nnews reader, but for E-mail. Cypht does not replace your existing accounts -\nit combines them into one. And it's also a news reader.\n\nVersion 1 Version 2\n\n## A standard E-mail client\n\nThe driving force behind Cypht development is to provide combined views for\nmultiple accounts, but it's also a standard E-mail client that lets you browse\nand manage IMAP folders and send outbound messages with SMTP\n\n## A set of plugins\n\nCypht is an application built entirely of plugins, or as we call them, module\nsets (which is obviously way cooler sounding than plugins), that are executed\nby the framework. Modules provide a flexible way to add new features or\ncustomize the program without hacking the code\n\n## An open source solution\n\nCypht is Open Source (LGPL V2), and written in PHP and JavaScript. If you are\nlooking for a lightweight webmail solution for an ISP, school, business, or\njust personal use, I hope that Cypht can help!\n\n## Features\n\n  * Combined inbox, unread, sent, and flagged message views for all your E-mail accounts (and RSS feeds), as well as standard E-mail client folder navigation\n  * Flexible profiles to combined IMAP accounts with SMTP accounts and setup signatures and reply to details\n  * Move or copy emails from one account to another\n  * Compose messages in plain text, HTML, or Markdown (markdown formatted messages are converted to HTML before being sent)\n\n  * Search all your E-mail accounts and RSS feeds at once with a simple form\n  * Simple interface translation system that does not use gettext or .po files, just arrays of translated strings defined in PHP. Right to left languages are supported.\n  * Module sets for IMAP, SMTP, LDAP or local contacts, WordPress, Github, and lots more! Check out the Modules page for a complete list.\n\n  * Sessions and user data can be stored in any PDO compatible database or flat files on the server\n  * Authentication is flexible and currently supports IMAP, LDAP, an included database schema, dynamic authentication using popular E-mail providers, auto-discovery based on the user's E-mail domain, or you can roll your own with the site module set\n  * Sessions and Authentication can be customized without breaking any modules using the site module set\n\nthe complete list\n\n## Have a question about security?\n\n### Found a flaw in Cypht?\n\nWe want to hear from you! Drop by the Cypht Gitter channel, or send me an\nE-mail at jason@cypht.org. We take security seriously. Cypht is an entirely\nvolunteer effort, so we can't afford a bounty program. We can however promise\nthat any security issue reported to us before release will receive a quick\nresponse, a thorough review, a sincere thanks, and an honorable mention on\nthis page.\n\n## A modular design\n\nInstead of an application with a plugin API, Cypht is an application comprised\nentirely of plugins, or as we call them, \"module sets\". There is only one\nrequired set, the \"core\" modules. The components of any module set can be\nadded to, or even replaced, by site specific modules. All the functionality of\nCypht is broken out into module sets, and each set is built from small pieces\nthat are also easy to override.\n\n## Have a suggestion or a question?\n\n### Or maybe you want to throw huge wads of cash at us?\n\nWe love feedback so let us know what you think!\n\nFill out an issue at Github Submit an issue\n\nChat with us at Gitter Cypht at Gitter\n\nSend an E-mail to: jason@cypht.org\n\nWant to contribute?
