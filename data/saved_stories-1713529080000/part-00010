It's official! All\nAndroid devices back to Android S received this new codec over the air. Most\ndevices can decode 720p30 in software using dav1d. Apps need to opt into dav1d\nto benefit for now yet soon it will become the default av1 software decoder.\"\n\n5h\n\nMishaal Rahman @MishaalRahman\n\nThe libdav1d codec is available on Android 12+ devices with the March 2024\nGoogle Play System Update or newer. However, the libgav1 codec is still used\nby default, so apps have to manually opt in to using libdav1d instead. YouTube\nhas already started doing so (though this has led to mixed results for some\nusers.\n\n5h\n\nMishaal Rahman @MishaalRahman\n\nCompared to libgav1, libdav1d is significantly more efficient and performant\nat decoding AV1 videos. Of course, a hardware accelerated decoder is still\npreferred, but many devices don't have a HW AV1 decoder.\n\nLet me know if you've noticed any changes in YouTube following the March 2024\nGPSU!\n\nFor more details, check out the article I wrote back in February that broke\nthe news: https://www.androidauthority.com/android-update-av1-videos-3420418/\n\nAndroid Authority \u00b7 Feb 27Upcoming Android update will give AV1 videos a big\nboost on budget devicesAndroid currently ships with the libgav1 AV1 decoder,\nbut a future update will switch that to libdav1d, which offers much better\nperformance.\n\n5h\n\nMishaal Rahman @MishaalRahman\n\nMy Nothing Phone 2 with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 (which doesn't have\nHW AV1 decoding support) smoothly decodes 1080p60 AV1 videos in YouTube.\n\nYou can see using the Codec Info app that there's two AV1 decoders:\n\nc2.android.av1-dav1d.decoder c2.android.av1.decoder\n\nThe latter is the libgav1 decoder, while the former is the new libdav1d\ndecoder.\n\nCurrently, the libgav1 decoder has a higher priority than libdav1d, hence it's\nused by default.\n\n(Higher number in the rank = lower priority.)\n\nExploreLive feeds\n\nLogin to follow profiles or hashtags, favorite, share and reply to posts.
