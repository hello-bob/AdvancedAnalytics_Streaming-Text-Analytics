His books include a travelogue\nset in post-apartheid South Africa and the award-winning \u201cCongo: The Epic\nHistory of a People\u201d about the former Belgian colony.\n\nIn his latest work, however, he has turned his attention to a group of\n\u201cvoiceless\u201d people much closer to home: voters in Europe and the United\nStates.\n\nA feeling of disenfranchisement, Van Reybrouck argues, lies behind the anger\non display among electorates across the West. The rise of populists like\nDonald Trump in the United States, Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, Marine Le\nPen in France and Frauke Petry in Germany, and the fury on display during the\nBrexit debate all share a common cause: an attempt by establishment\npoliticians to shut down the debate. It\u2019s because citizens are feeling\nexcluded that the shouting is getting louder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe anger of citizens we see today is not a danger for democracy,\u201d says Van\nReybrouck. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift. It shows that people are committed and are willing to\nengage with their society. It\u2019s a gift, but it\u2019s wrapped in barbed wire.\u201d The\ntrick, with this gift, he says, is to figure out how to unwrap it.\n\n* * *\n\nVan Reybrouck\u2019s insights came out of the 2010-2011 Belgian political crisis,\nin which the country\u2019s elected officials failed to form a government for 541\ndays. What most political commentators wrote off as a quirk of an unwieldy\npolitical process became, for Van Reybrouck, the symptom of a larger problem.\n\nThe idea that citizens were given the right to speak only every four or five\nyears, and only by ticking a box on a piece of a paper, struck him as absurd \u2014\nand counterproductive. \u201cDemocracy is quintessentially people talking to each\nother,\u201d he says. \u201cBut our democracies have become very, very silent. We vote\nin silence, and then we shout ... on Facebook and Twitter. But a sort of\nmeaningful discussion with people who might have different ideas is not taking\nplace anymore.\u201d\n\n> \u201cThe easiest job for a politician today is to be a populist leader.\u201d\n\nIt is not just that people feel voiceless, it\u2019s that they are voiceless.\nGovernments across Europe have met anger with anger. Attacks on populism have\nbeen just as vitriolic as their targets. As those expressions of anger are\ndismissed as ignorant, uninformed or retrograde, the gulf between the elite\nand the broader public has grown. \u201cMany of the politicians today remind me of\nthe aristocracy in 1788,\u201d says Van Reybrouck. \u201cThe masses are shouting and\nyeah that\u2019s annoying, but the crisis won\u2019t come. One year later, the Bastille\nwas stormed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe mounting sense of frustration, he says, feeds into the populist narrative.\n\u201cThe easiest job for a politician today is to be a populist leader,\u201d he says.\nIf someone with \u201ca little more self-control than Donald Trump\u201d had taken up\nthe banner of populism in the United States, he or she would easily have swept\nup the votes of an increasingly frustrated electorate.\n\nReferendums may have become the tool of choice for politicians trying to\nreassure voters that they are being heard. But these offer only the illusion\nof control, says Van Reybrouck. In the Brexit debate, for instance, voters\nwere made to believe their vote mattered, but once the polls had closed and\nthe votes to leave had been counted, they quickly lost any say in how their\ndecision would be implemented. \u201cThe referendum has become the toy of populist\nleaders,\u201d says Van Reybrouck. \u201cI am deeply convinced that if we refuse to\nupdate democracy, we\u2019ll see the end of democracy, and quite soon.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nIn the midst of the Belgian crisis of 2011, Van Reybrouck launched G1000, an\nexperiment in participatory democracy that brought together 704 people chosen\nat random to discuss ideas for solving Belgium\u2019s political gridlock.\n\nParticipants were asked to express their feelings on various aspects of the\npolitical situation by rating the government\u2019s response to an issue on a scale\nof one to 10. They proposed steps that would incrementally improve that rating\nby a notch or two, and then discussed the ideas with their neighbors over\nseveral rounds of debate led by academics and political experts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the answers were gathered by the organizers, the result was a collection\nof tangible policy proposals that were handed over to the country\u2019s seven\npresidents of parliament. The format has since been adopted by political\nparties across Belgium, and the Netherlands has hosted more than 10 of its own\nG1000 events. The Dutch government has created a parliamentary commission to\nlook at democratic renewal. And in the city of Utrecht, the mayor\u2019s cabinet\nregularly confers with citizens for solutions to pressing policy issues, such\nas migration, that weren\u2019t on the table during electoral campaigns.\n\n> \u201cNot doing anything about our democracy is opening the gates to anarchy.\u201d\n\nSmall European countries, especially those that have gone through a crisis\nsuch as Belgium and Iceland are more willing to innovate and should become\nlaboratories for mechanisms of participatory democracy, he says. At the\nmoment, Ireland leads the pack. In 2012, 66 citizens were chosen by lot to\njoin 34 government officials in a debate on constitutional reforms. In\nOctober, the country repeated the process, randomly selecting 99 citizens to\ntackle some of the country\u2019s most politically sensitive questions, including\nlegalizing abortion and climate change.\n\nVan Reybrouck, who has laid out his ideas in his book, \u201cAgainst Elections: A\nCase for Democracy,\u201d has been invited by the leader of the Belgian senate to\nhold an experiment in which a chamber of citizens chosen by lot would join\nsenators in discussing issues that fall under the senate\u2019s purview, such as\nconstitutional reform and laws governing the organization of the federal\nsystem.\n\nThe idea, he is careful to say, is not to replace elections with a lottery.\nIt\u2019s to experiment with methods to bring the voices of citizens into the\ndemocratic process.\n\nAt the risk of sounding like a Cassandra prophesying the end of days, Van\nReybrouck cautions that our democracies have become ticking time bombs. \u201cI see\nwhy people fear anarchy when they hear me talk,\u201d he says. \u201cBut not doing\nanything about our democracy is opening the gates to anarchy.\u201d\n\n## Also On POLITICO\n\nPolitical science\n\n## How to beat populism\n\nBy Cas Mudde\n\n## German president: populists won\u2019t win\n\nBy Hortense Goulard\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Tags\n\nElections Euroskeptics National Politics\n\nRelated Countries\n\nBelgium The Netherlands United States\n\n## Our readers read next\n\nCommentary\n\n## Here\u2019s what a Le Pen presidency would really mean for France \u2014 and the EU\n\nApr 5 5 mins read\n\n## More from Esther King\n\n## Tokidoki\n\nAn inventive, down-to-earth restaurant with a small menu and big heart.\n\nFeb 8 2 mins read\n\n## Gazzetta\n\nA trendy, intimate neighborhood favorite serving up quality Italian food.\n\nNov 9 3 mins read\n\n## Le P\u2019tit Chouia En +\n\nCozy, unpretentious home-style Moroccan cuisine.\n\nSep 28 2 mins read\n\n## L\u2019Altitude\n\nA self-described neighborhood bar for music lovers, this spot is a local gem\nfar from the Brussels bubble crowd.\n\nOct 13 2 mins read\n\n", "frontpage": true}
