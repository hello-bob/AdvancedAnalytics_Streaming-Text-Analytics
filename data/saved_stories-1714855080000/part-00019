Why is it now subject to the\nsame kind of antitrust complaints once faced by Microsoft, the \u201cevil empire\u201d\nof the previous generation of computing? Why is it that Amazon, which has\npositioned itself as \u201cthe most customer-centric company on the planet,\u201d now\nlards its search results with advertisements, placing them ahead of the\ncustomer-centric results chosen by the company\u2019s organic search algorithms,\nwhich prioritize a combination of low price, high customer ratings, and other\nsimilar factors?\n\nThe answer can be found in the theory of economic rents, and in particular, in\nthe kinds of rents that are collected by companies during different stages of\nthe technology business cycle. There are many types of rents and an extensive\neconomics literature discussing them, but for purposes of this article, they\ncan be lumped into two broad categories\u2014\u201crising tide rents\u201d that benefit\nsociety as a whole, such as those that encourage innovation and the\ndevelopment of new markets, and \u201crobber baron rents\u201d that disproportionately\nbenefit those with power.\n\n## Learn faster.

This can be due to the ownership of a\nscarce asset, the creation of monopolistic conditions that enable rising\nreturns in a specific sector, or policy decisions that favour directly or\nindirectly a specific group of interest.\u201d\n\nFor example, consider drug pricing. Patents\u2014exclusive, government-granted\nrights intended to encourage innovation\u2014protect pharmaceutical companies from\ncompetition and allow them to charge high prices. Once the patents expire,\nthere is competition from so-called \u201cgeneric drugs,\u201d and the price comes down.\nThat difference in price (and its impact on pharmaceutical company profits)\nshows the extent of the rent.\n\nIn 20th century neoliberal economics, rents have typically been seen as a\ntemporary aberration that is eventually competed away. They are a price that\nwe pay for a rising tide of innovation. But as Mazzucato points out, to the\nclassical economists\u2014Smith, Ricardo, and Mill\u2014who lived in a world of\ninherited power and privilege, rents were a pernicious and persistent\nconsequence (and source) of inequality. At the dawn of economic theory,\nagriculture was still the chief source of value creation, and much of that\nvalue created by the labor of serfs and tenant farmers was appropriated by\nthose who owned the land. When the local baron sent his troops to collect what\nhe considered his share of the harvest, it was impossible to say no. In an\nunjust society, neither effort nor investment nor innovation but rents rooted\nin power asymmetries determine who gets what and why.\n\nBut not all rents represent abuse of power. As noted by economist Joseph\nSchumpeter, innovation\u2014whether protected by patents, trade secrets, or just by\nmoving faster and more capably than the competition\u2014provides an opportunity to\nreceive a disproportionate share of profits until the innovation is spread\nmore widely.\n\nDuring the expansive period of a new technology cycle, market leaders emerge\nbecause they solve new problems and create new value not only for consumers\nbut also for a rich ecosystem of suppliers, intermediaries, and even\ncompetitors. Even though the market leaders tend to receive a disproportionate\nshare of the profits as they lay waste to incumbents and dominate the emerging\nmarket, value creation is a rising tide that lifts all boats.\n\nBut this kind of virtuous rising tide rent, which benefits everyone, doesn\u2019t\nlast. Once the growth of the new market slows, the now-powerful innovators can\nno longer rely on new user adoption and collective innovation from a vibrant\necosystem to maintain their extraordinary level of profit. In the dying stages\nof the old cycle, the companies on top of the heap turn to extractive\ntechniques, using their market power to try to maintain their now-customary\nlevel of profits in the face of macroeconomic factors and competition that\nought to be eating them away. They start to collect robber baron rents. That\u2019s\nexactly what Google, Amazon, and Meta are doing today.\n\nThen the cycle begins again with a new class of competitors, who are forced to\nexplore new, disruptive technologies that reset the entire market. Enter\nOpenAI, Anthropic, and their ilk.\n\n### Attention is all you need\n\nWhat is the source of big tech market power? What is the limited resource that\nthey control and monopolize? It\u2019s not our data. It\u2019s not the price of the\nservices we purchase from them\u2014they give those away for free. It\u2019s our\nattention.\n\nBack in 1971, in a talk called \u201cDesigning Organizations for an Information-\nrich World,\u201d political scientist Herbert Simon noted that the cost of\ninformation is not just money spent to acquire it but the time it takes to\nconsume it.\n\n> \u201cIn an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of\n> something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What\n> information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its\n> recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and\n> a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of\n> information sources that might consume it.\u201d\n\nIn the discussion following the talk, Simon noted that in the future,\ninformation would be so abundant that we would need machines to help us manage\nour attention.\n\nAnd that has indeed been the secret to success in the information age. Google\nwas founded with the promise of finding the right web page out of billions,\ngiving you just what you want and then sending you on your way. Amazon aimed\nto help customers find the best quality and price for any one of millions of\nproducts. Even social media started with the promise of information triage:\nfor each person, a unique feed of updates from only the friends they had\nchosen to follow. These are all astonishing tools for making our limited\ncapacity for attention more efficient.\n\nIn the early idealistic days of internet expansion, the leading companies\nearned outsized profits by solving the attention allocation problem. As the\ninternet grew, the amount of information available to consumers became so vast\nthat it outran traditional human means of curation and selection. Attention\nallocation was outsourced to the machines. Algorithms for search,\nrecommendations, social media feeds, entertainment, and news became the\nfoundation of an enormous new economy.\n\nThe internet giants succeeded by doing what they are now too often reviled\nfor: extracting signal from massive amounts of data. Google not only crawled\nand indexed virtually every page on the web, it looked at how sites linked to\neach other, tracked which of the ten top links it showed were clicked on the\nmost, which ones led people to come back and try another and which sent them\naway satisfied. It used location data and past searches to make answers more\nrelevant and personalized. Amazon too used everything from price, user\nreviews, popularity, and your individual purchase history to bring to the top\nthe products they believed best matched their customers\u2019 needs. In my 2005\nessay \u201cWhat is Web 2.0?,\u201d I made the case that the companies that had survived\nthe dotcom bust had all in one way or another become experts at \u201charnessing\ncollective intelligence.\u201d\n\nPerhaps a more direct way to say this in the context of economic value\ncreation is that companies such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook had developed\na set of remarkable advances in networked and data-enabled market\ncoordination.\n\nBut over time, something went very wrong. Instead of continuing to deploy\ntheir attention optimization algorithms for their users\u2019 and suppliers\u2019\nbenefit, the tech giants began to use them to favor themselves. It first\nbecame obvious with social media: recommended posts and amplification of\naddictive, divisive content in order to keep users scrolling, creating\nadditional surface area for advertising. Google began to place more and more\nadvertising ahead of \u201corganic\u201d search results, turning advertising from a\ncomplementary stream of useful information that ran beside search results into\na substitute. Amazon was late to the party, but once it discovered\nadvertising, it went all in. Now a typical page of Amazon product search\nresults consists of 16 ads and only four organic results.\n\nGoogle and Amazon were still atop their respective hills of web search and\necommerce in 2010, and Meta\u2019s growth was still accelerating, but it was hard\nto miss that internet growth had begun to slow. The market was maturing. From\n2000 to 2011, the percentage of US adults using the internet had grown from\nabout 60% to nearly 80%. By the end of 2012, it was up to 82%. But in 2013 and\n2014, it remained stuck at 83%, and while in the ten years since, it has\nreached 95%, it had become clear that the easy money that came from acquiring\nmore users was ending. Penetration in Europe, the other lucrative market, was\non a similar track to the US, and while there was lots of user growth still to\nbe found in the rest of the world, the revenue per user was much lower. What\nare now-gigantic companies to do when their immense market capitalization\ndepends on rapid growth and the expectation of growing profits to match?\n\nThese companies did continue to innovate. Some of those innovations, like\nAmazon\u2019s cloud computing business, represented enormous new markets and a new\nbusiness model. But the internet giants also came to focus on extracting more\nusage and time spent, and thus more revenue, from a relatively stable base of\nexisting customers. Often this was done by making their products more\naddictive, getting more out of their users by nefarious means. Cory Doctorow\ncalls this the \u201censhittification\u201d of Big Tech platforms.\n\nFast forward to the present, and Amazon has clearly given up on the goal of\nfinding the best result for its users. Since launching its Marketplace\nadvertising business in 2016, Amazon has chosen to become a \u201cpay to play\u201d\nplatform where the top results are those that are most profitable for the\ncompany.\n\nIn \u201cAmazon is burying organic search results,\u201d research firm Marketplace Pulse\nnotes:\n\n> Of the first twenty products a shopper sees when searching on Amazon, only\n> four are organic results. There is little space left for organic results at\n> the top of the page, the real estate that drives most sales. Few purchases\n> happen beyond the first page of search results. And not many shoppers scroll\n> to the bottom of even the first page...\n>\n> It takes scrolling past three browser windows worth of search results to get\n> to the fifth organic result. It takes even more swipes to see the fifth\n> organic result on mobile.\n\nThis is what we mean by a \u201crobber baron\u201d rent: \u201cpay us, or you\u2019ll effectively\ndisappear from search.\u201d\n\nThe harm to users isn\u2019t just time lost while scrolling through ads to find the\nbest results. In a recent research project at University College London\u2019s\nInstitute for Innovation and Public Purpose, my colleagues and I found that\nusers still tend to click on the product results at the top of the page even\nwhen they are no longer the best results. Amazon abuses the trust that users\nhave come to place in its algorithms, and instead allocates user attention and\nclicks to inferior quality sponsored information. The most-clicked sponsored\nproducts were 17% more expensive and 33% lower ranked according to Amazon\u2019s\nown quality, price, and popularity optimizing algorithms. And because product\nsuppliers must now pay for the product ranking that they previously earned\nthrough product quality and reputation, their profits go down as Amazon\u2019s go\nup, and prices rise as some of the cost is passed on to customers.\n\nIt appears to have worked\u2014for now. Amazon\u2019s recent quarterly disclosures (Q4,\n2023), for example, show year-on-year growth in online sales revenue of 9%,\nbut growth in fees of 20% (third-party seller services) and 27% (advertising\nsales). But the historical lessons from the downfall of both IBM mainframe\nmonopoly and Microsoft\u2019s stranglehold on the personal computer suggests that\nthe company will be forced to renew its commitment to value creation or face\ndecline and challenges from new, disruptive market entrants who are focused on\nproviding the kind of value to users and suppliers that Amazon once did. The\ndamage to Amazon may be a gradual downslope or a sudden cliff. When does brand\nand reputation damage accumulate to the point that consumers start trusting\nAmazon less, shopping at Amazon less, and expending the effort of trying\nalternatives? If history is any judge, it will happen sooner or later unless\nAmazon dials back the rents.\n\nA similar dark pattern is visible in the evolution of Google search. Starting\naround 2011, advertising, which once framed the organic results and was\nclearly differentiated from them by color, gradually became more dominant, and\nthe signaling that it was advertising became more subtle. Today, especially on\nmobile, the user may have to scroll down several times to get to the first\norganic result. The result is less striking than on Amazon, since a very large\npercentage of Google searches carry no advertisements at all. But for\ncommercial searches, the best result for users (a local merchant, for example)\ncan often only be found after scrolling through pages of ads from internet\nsellers and national chains.\n\nThe harms to users are thus less than they appear to be at Amazon, where\nadvertising distorts the results of every search, but there are still serious\nconcerns. Both Google and Amazon are gatekeepers controlling the visibility of\na vast ecosystem of suppliers. Those suppliers aren\u2019t just a commodity to be\nexploited by the platform. They are its partners in creating the value that\ndraws users to the platform. Without websites, there would be no need for\nGoogle search or raw material for its results; without merchants, no Amazon.\nThe same is true of other internet gatekeepers. Without app developers, there\nwould be no App Stores; without users creating content as well as consuming\nit, no social media.\n\n#### This is what we mean by a \u201crobber baron\u201d rent: \u201cpay us, or you\u2019ll\neffectively disappear from search.\u201d\n\nWhen suppliers are harmed, users too will be harmed over the long run. These\necosystems of value co-creators depend on the platform\u2019s fairness in\nallocating attention to the most relevant results. When the platform displaces\norganic results with paid results, preferences its own applications, products,\nor services, or provides information directly to the consumer in competition\nwith the originators of that information, the ecosystem suffers a loss of\nincentive and reward for continuing to produce value. Eventually, this loss of\nvalue affects both users and the platform itself, and the whole virtuous\ncircle of creation, aggregation, and curation breaks down.\n\nThe company itself is also harmed, as even its own innovations may be held\nback in order to protect lucrative existing lines of business. Google, for\nexample, invented the Large Language model architecture that underlies today\u2019s\ndisruptive AI startups. It published the original Transformer paper (not quite\ncoincidentally called \u201cAttention is All You Need\u201d) in 2017, and released BERT,\nan open source implementation, in late 2018, but never went so far as to build\nand release anything like OpenAI\u2019s GPT line of services. It\u2019s unclear whether\nthis was a lack of imagination or a kind of \u201cstrategy tax.\u201d It was certainly\nobvious to outsiders how disruptive BERT could be to Google Search. In 2020,\nwhen my own company released O\u2019Reilly Answers, a plain language search engine\nbased on BERT for the content on the O\u2019Reilly platform, I was struck by how,\nfor the first time, we could search our own content better than Google could.\n\nIt was left to startups to explore the broader possibilities of generative AI\nand chatbots.\n\n## Will History Repeat Itself?\n\nThe enshittification of Amazon and Google is old news to most users. We\nremember how good these services used to be, and lament their decline. But we\nhave slowly gotten used to the fact that results are not what they once were.\n\nAntitrust authorities in Europe and the US have woken up, and are questioning\nabuses of market power by Big Tech companies, albeit not always successfully.\nRegulators may force better behavior. My hope, though, is that in responding\nto new competitors, the companies themselves may wake up and pull back from\nthe brink before it\u2019s too late.\n\nIt\u2019s already clear that LLMs may offer the greatest competition that Google,\nAmazon, and other current internet giants have ever faced. While the results\nare as yet inferior to those offered by Google and Amazon, users are already\nasking questions of ChatGPT that would once have gone to a search engine. The\nlower quality of the results is typical in the early days of a disruptive\ntechnology. It doesn\u2019t matter, because disruptive technologies start out by\nsolving new problems, serving new markets, and creating new opportunities. But\ntheir disruptive quality also comes because novel technology companies draw\noutside the lines that have been drawn to protect the business model of the\nexisting players. They are eager to surprise and delight their users; the\nfocus in the early days is always on value creation. Mature and declining\ncompanies, by contrast, tend to hobble their products as they focus on value\nextraction. They lose their ideals and their edge, eventually alienating their\ncustomers and their suppliers and opening the door to competition.\n\nWe are in those early days once again. Leadership comes to those who create\nthe most value for the most users. It is only later, after the market\nconsolidates, that the value extraction phase begins. At that point, will the\nnew market leaders also turn to more traditional extractive techniques? Just\nlike today\u2019s incumbents, will they end up using their market power to protect\ntheir now-customary level of profits in the face of macroeconomic factors and\ncompetition that ought to be eating them away?\n\nRegulators would be wise to get ahead of this development. The current\ngeneration of algorithmic overlords shape the attention of their users,\nhelping to decide what we read and watch and buy, whom we befriend and whom we\nbelieve. The next generation will shape human cognition, creativity, and\ninteraction even more profoundly.\n\nThere is a great deal of discussion about the risks and benefits of AI, but it\nis generally focused narrowly on the technical capabilities of AI tools and\nwhether continued advances will eventually put AI beyond human control,\nleading to possible disaster. Closer to the present, risk analysis focuses on\nsocial problems like bias, misinformation, and hate speech, or the potential\nspread of biological and nuclear capabilities.\n\nYet many of the most pressing risks are economic, embedded in the financial\naims of the companies that control and manage AI systems and services. Are AI\ncompanies going to be immune to the incentives that have made today\u2019s current\ntech giants turn against their users and their suppliers, the same incentives\nthat have led financial institutions to peddle bad assets, pharmaceutical\ncompanies to promote opioids, cigarette companies to hide the health risks of\nsmoking, and oil companies to deny climate change? I think not.\n\nRather than blaming the moral failings of company leadership, look instead to\nthe economic incentives that rule public companies. Financial markets\n(including venture capitalists considering valuation of the next round) reward\ncompanies handsomely for outsized growth of revenue and profit, while brutally\npunishing any slowdown. Since stock options are a large part of executive\ncompensation\u2014and all compensation at Silicon Valley companies\u2014failing to\ndeliver the required growth comes at a very high cost to company leadership\nand employees.\n\nIt is too early to know best how to regulate AI. But one thing is certain. You\ncan\u2019t regulate what you don\u2019t understand. Economic abuses by companies\ntypically hide in plain sight for years, with whistleblowers, researchers,\nregulators, and lawyers struggling to prove what the companies continue to\ndeny. This is going to be even more true of an inscrutable black box like AI.\n\nAI safety and governance will be impossible without robust and consistent\ninstitutions for disclosure and auditing. To achieve prosocial outcomes, AI\nmodel and application developers need to define the metrics that explicitly\naim for those outcomes and then measure and report the extent to which they\nhave been achieved. These are not narrow technical disclosures of model\ncapabilities, but the metrics the companies use to manage AI as a business,\nincluding what processes and metrics they use to reduce the risks that have\nbeen identified. If they begin to twist AI\u2019s training, guardrails, and\nobjectives for their own benefit, we should be able to see it in the numbers.\n\nThe time to do this is now, when AI developers are still in the virtuous stage\nof innovation and rising tide rents, and while the companies are exploring the\npossibilities of AI regulation. It is important to understand what \u201cgood\u201d\nlooks like while companies are still putting their best foot forward,\ndeveloping services to delight and serve users and suppliers and society, so\nthat if (or perhaps when) the incentives to take advantage of others take\nover, we can look back and see when and how things began to go wrong.\n\nLet\u2019s not wait till the robber barons are back.\n\nA longer version of this article was previously published as part of the UCL\nInstitute for Innovation and Public Purpose, Working Paper Series (IIPP WP\n2024-04).
