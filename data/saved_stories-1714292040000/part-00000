Then the plot curdled. - The\nWashington Post\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemocracy Dies in Darkness\n\n# A vegan cheese beat dairy in a big competition. Then the plot curdled.\n\nBy Emily Heil\n\nApril 27, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. EDT\n\n(Cece Pascual/The Washington Post; iStock/The Washington Post)\n\nListen\n\n12 min\n\nShare\n\nComment\n\nSave\n\nIn the wine world, the 1976 Judgment of Paris \u2014 a blind taste test in which\nCalifornia chardonnays and Bordeauxs beat out their French counterparts \u2014 is\nremembered as the shocking upending of long-standing order.\n\nA similar moment looked like it was coming to the demimonde of artisanal\ncheese. On Monday, the winners will be announced of the Good Food awards, a\nprestigious honor that considers both the quality of the products and the\nenvironmental and social consciousness of the companies that produce them.\n\nWhen the California-based foundation that doles them out announced the\nfinalists in January, among the candidates was a blue cheese from Climax Foods\nfrom Berkeley, Calif. The difference between that entrant and its competitors\nwasn\u2019t a silky mouthfeel or buttery flavor, but rather the fact that the\nClimax Blue \u2014 which is served in restaurants including Michelin-starred Eleven\nMadison Park in New York \u2014 wasn\u2019t made from the milk of cows or goats, but\nrather a blend of ingredients including pumpkin seeds, lima beans, hemp seeds,\ncoconut fat and cocoa butter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nA plant-based \u201ccheese\u201d held up as an exemplar, in a blind tasting, among true\ndairy products? Traditional cheesemakers were shocked. As word spread about\nthe interloper, mostly through food writer Janet Fletcher\u2019s Planet Cheese\nnewsletter, the controversy fomented.\n\nThe Good Foods Foundation that oversees the awards at first offered a\ncompromise solution: If, in fact, the Climax cheese was a winner, it\nannounced, the foundation would name a co-winner. Then the foundation would\nreevaluate for next year, perhaps creating a new category or moving them into\nthe broader snacks cohort.\n\nBut behind the scenes, things were getting messy.\n\nThis week, the foundation quietly removed the Climax Blue from the list of\nfinalists on its website but didn\u2019t make public what had disqualified the\ncheese. It wasn\u2019t the fact that it is plant-based, since those products are\nexplicitly allowed. But it had never been an issue since a vegan cheese had\nnever impressed the judges enough to be named a finalist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nWhen asked by The Washington Post about its reasoning, Good Foods Foundation\nexecutive director Sarah Weiner at first declined to say, but she said\nsomething similar had happened only three times in the awards\u2019 14-year\nhistory. Someone \u2014 another entrant, perhaps, or someone else in the community\n\u2014 can alert the foundation that a contestant might not meet the requirements\nthey attested to, which include such things as meeting animal-husbandry\nguidelines where applicable and offering employees fair wages and diversity\ntraining. Weiner also wouldn\u2019t say who tipped off the foundation about Climax.\n\n\u201cI think there were a lot more eyes on this particular entrant than there\nwould be on one of the hundreds of other finalists,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich made it\nmore likely that someone with expertise would reach out.\u201d\n\nClimax CEO Oliver Zahn accused the foundation of caving to pressure from dairy\ncheesemakers in revoking the award. And then he spilled the curds: Climax, it\nturns out, wasn\u2019t just a finalist \u2014 it was set to win the award, a fact that\nall parties are asked to keep confidential until the official ceremony in\nPortland, Ore., but was revealed in an email the foundation sent to Climax in\nJanuary. Based on that information, Zahn and several of his colleagues had\nplanned to attend, booking hotel rooms and making travel plans, until, he\nsays, learning from this reporter that his cheese was no longer in the\nrunning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAnd in the days leading up to the big event, Climax and the Good Food\nFoundation offered differing versions of the circumstances around the rare\naward revocation.\n\nZahn says the foundation made no attempt to reach the company to address\npotential questions, citing company email records. Weiner says they emailed\nand called the person who had submitted the application \u2014 who they learned no\nlonger works for Climax \u2014 and then emailed another employee with no response.\n\nZahn says he suspects that the person who lodged the complaint is an\n\u201cinformant\u201d from the dairy cheese world who has been particularly outspoken.\nThe substance of the complaint appeared to rest on the ingredient kokum butter\n\u2014 which is derived from the seeds of a kokum tree\u2019s fruit \u2014 that Climax used\nin an earlier version of its cheese. Kokum butter has not been designated as\nGRAS (generally regarded as safe) by the Food and Drug Administration. Not all\ningredients need a GRAS certification: The FDA grandfathers those that have\ncommon use in food.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nWhen Climax and the other competitors submitted their products, the Good Food\nAwards didn\u2019t explicitly require GRAS certification for all ingredients. Since\nthen, though, the foundation added GRAS certification to its rules \u2014 a move\nZahn says was a belated and clumsy attempt to disqualify him. It isn\u2019t clear\nwhen the foundation added the language, but an internet archive search showed\nthat the new wording wasn\u2019t there in January, after the finalists had been\nannounced. Weiner said the awards exist to promote good foods, and that food\nsafety is part of that definition. The addition of the language was \u201ca\nclarification of our principles and standards ... rather than a new rule,\u201d she\nsaid in an email.\n\nZahn says the kokum butter shouldn\u2019t be an issue anyway: The company has\nreplaced it with cocoa butter, which does have GRAS certification, and that\u2019s\nthe version he says the version he submitted for the awards. (Weiner contends\nthat Climax submitted an ingredient list that included kokum.) Zahn says they\ncould have worked the confusion out if they\u2019d only known about the complaint\nsooner, but Weiner said the company missed a deadline to respond. \u201cThis is\nsomething we would have been happy to take a look at if they had gotten back\nto us in time,\u201d she said in an email.\n\nAnother dispute between the two sides? Weiner said the Climax cheese violated\na requirement that any product submitted for an award be ready for retail\nsale, but Zahn insists the cheese is retail-ready.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nWeiner called the controversy around Climax and its ultimate disqualification\n\u201ca big bummer,\u201d but said it showed how much the food community cares about the\nfoundation\u2019s mission. \u201cOur way of making change is to celebrate the good as\nopposed to call out the bad,\u201d she says. \u201cBut other people are good at that.\u201d\n\nZahn, though, was left frustrated. For his fledgling company, a Good Food\nAward would have attracted potential buyers for retail stores and impressed\nwould-be investors. Instead, he was soured by the experience \u2014 and pretty sure\nhe won\u2019t submit entrants in future years. \u201cChanging the rules six months after\nsubmission, and then not even trying to reach the company to try to fix a\nfixable situation? If that happened in my company, I would step down as CEO,\u201d\nhe says. \u201cSeriously, I would step down because that would be so embarrassing\nto me that there was no way I could justify continuing to run the company. And\nI would fire anybody who was involved.\u201d\n\nThe to-do wasn\u2019t just a tempest in a cheese pot, the kind of infighting you\nmight find in any industry. Writ large, a plant-based cheese\u2019s ascension to\nthe top of a prestigious heap might be a bellwether moment, an inflection\npoint in the evolution of vegan cheese from rubbery-textured punchline to a\nproduct worthy of sitting alongside some of the country\u2019s top cheddars and\ntommes. And the pushback might offer a preview of the battle that could play\nout over supermarket shelf space and even the word \u201ccheese\u201d itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nTo Zahn, the method he\u2019s using isn\u2019t all that different from the one used for\ncenturies. When it comes down to it, he notes, plants fuel the animals that\nproduce milk \u2014 and so in concocting a milk made out of plants, Zahn says he\u2019s\njust cutting out the middleman (or middle-bovine). In his analysis of\ntraditional cheesemaking, a cow is essentially a processing machine \u2014 and not\na very efficient one at that.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of energy being used to turn something from one thing to\nanother, and in the case of a cow, 90 percent of the inputs go to just\nprocessing,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is no factory you could potentially devise that\nwould come with that much processing.\u201d\n\nBut traditional cheesemakers see the companies making vegan products as simply\noperating in another business entirely.\n\n\u201cThese are engineered products. And they\u2019re part of a financialized food\nsystem that\u2019s fueled by venture capital and disconnected from nature,\u201d says\nMateo Kehler, co-owner of the family-run Jasper Hill Farm in Vermont. Kehler\u2019s\ncheese has previously won Good Food awards, and his bark-wrapped, bloomy-rind\nHarbison cheese is a finalist this year. \u201cYou have these technological\nproducts, but they rely on adjacency to the value proposition that we have\ncreated \u2014 through labor and through creating products that are truly connected\nto a landscape, to a farming system, and to our collective human history.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cOne could make the argument that this is like a fraudulent cheese,\u201d Kehler\nsaid. \u201cAs a cheesemaker, it\u2019s a fraud. It looks like a cheese. It might taste\nlike a cheese. But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s not connected to our historical\nunderstanding of what cheeses are.\u201d\n\nKehler appreciates that consumers might want to buy foods that take less of a\ntoll on the environment. But, he says, his farm and ones like it have a much\nsmaller environmental footprint than many of the crops, such as almonds, that\nare used to create many vegan products. \u201cThe people are compelling,\u201d he says\nof the vegan cheese companies. \u201cThe foundational principles and the big ideas\nare really compelling \u2014 like the idea of fully disrupting industrial\nagriculture. But that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nFrom a taste perspective, Zahn understands the bad rap that vegan cheese has\ngotten, or at least what he describes as the \u201cfirst generation\u201d of the\nproducts that rely on artificial flavorings, gums, starches and oils with\nresults that are often bouncy and gummy. But the category is evolving, with\ncompanies making high-end products that more closely mimic the real thing,\noften using culturing and aging processes similar to the traditional methods.\nVegan cheese shops have opened from Los Angeles to Atlanta. Big food companies\nare delving in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nFor the Good Food awards, a panel of judges taste entrants without knowing\ntheir brands. In the cheese category, judges may learn whether the samples are\nfrom cow or goat\u2019s milk \u2014 or in the case of Climax, from plants. Weiner\nindicated that the judges were aware that they were trying a vegan entrant.\n\u201cVery impressive for being vegan but obviously plant-based,\u201d was one judge\u2019s\nwritten comment, she relayed.\n\n\u201cThe fact that they selected us to make it this far is exciting, and a\ntestament to the fact that we don\u2019t need cows,\u201d Zahn says.\n\nJanet Fletcher, the newsletter author who has been following the controversy,\nsays it has stoked an unusual level of drama in a typically collegial\nindustry. \u201cFor some farmers, it feels almost like an insult to say that their\nproduct could be compared to something created in the lab,\u201d she says.\n\nThe Good Food awards matter, she says. They might not be something the average\nconsumer is aware of, but retailers often look for the imprimatur when seeking\nout high-quality, ethically sourced goods.\n\nThe incident also brings up the question of semantics. Can you call something\n\u201ccheese\u201d that has nothing to do with animals? We\u2019ve been here with milk: When\nalternatives, starting with soy, began making inroads, the dairy industry\npushed back. They ultimately lost, with the Food and Drug Administration\nreleasing guidelines allowing plant-based products to be labeled and marketed\nas milk, but the battle has continued: Last year, the Milk Processor Education\nProgram brought back its iconic milk-mustache motif in a faux advertisement in\nwhich actress Aubrey Plaza plays the CEO of a company that makes an\nunappealing \u201cwood milk,\u201d a clear jab at the alt-milk industry.\n\nMiquela Hanselman, director of regulatory affairs for the National Milk\nProducers Federation, says vegan products don\u2019t meet the federally prescribed\nstandards of identity for cheese, either. \u201cOur stance is basically the same \u2014\nif you\u2019re going to use the word cheese on your package, and you\u2019re not going\nto qualify it with \u2018substitute\u2019 or \u2018alternative\u2019 that is pretty boldly out\nthere and explain the differences, then it shouldn\u2019t be on the label.\u201d\n\nMarjorie Mulhall, senior director of policy for the Plant Based Food\nAssociation, says labeling is just a matter of making things easier for\nshoppers. \u201cUsing cheese terminology helps consumers locate plant-based foods\nto meet their needs,\u201d she said in an email.\n\nZahn insists he isn\u2019t hung up on terminology, and would defer to consumers on\nthe matter. And while he says he doesn\u2019t want to offend traditional\ncheesemakers and instead hopes they can coexist, he challenges his skeptics to\nhave an open mind. \u201cMaybe there is a fear about us infringing or replacing\nthem, but I don\u2019t see it that way \u2014 I just want us all to work together\ntowards the better,\u201d he says. \u201cThe other thing I would tell them is to taste\nit themselves. Do they like it?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nPersonal finance\n\nThe basics for making smart money decisions\n\nHow this new rule protects retirement savers from costly advice\n\nAdvice|Borrowers, don\u2019t miss this important student loan forgiveness deadline\n\nAdvice|Keep these 10 financial documents forever.
