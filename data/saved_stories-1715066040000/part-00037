It enables workflows that would otherwise be cumbersome or impossible\nto do with lesser file managers. On the other hand, I also feel that Dired is\npunishing to users new (and sometimes old). In my opinion, Dired out of the\nbox is a power tool with poor user interface affordances and many questionable\ndefault settings. All this ends up making Dired harder to use than I think it\nshould.\n\nGiven my activity of late in using Transient menus, it seemed manifest what to\ndo here: make a Transient-based porcelain for Dired.\n\nAnnouncing Casual Dired, now available on MELPA.\n\nHopefully the screenshot above expresses clearly what you can do with it. In\nmaking it, care was taken to not rely on third party Emacs packages or tools\noutside of GNU coreutils (for ls) and ImageMagick (for identify). For users\nnew to Dired, note that a subdir should be thought of a logical view on a sub-\ndirectory that can be created or destroyed without impact to the actual\nphysical sub-directory.\n\nIf you share the same sentiments I\u2019ve described above, I invite you to try\nCasual Dired out. With it, I\u2019ve tried to strike a balance that offers good\ndiscovery for new users, while providing bindings that are immediately\nfamiliar to experienced users. I\u2019m quite pleased with the end result and I\nsuspect you\u2019ll think likewise.\n\n# Links\n\n  * Casual Dired repo on GitHub\n  * Casual Dired on MELPA\n\nemacs\n\nMathing in Emacs with Casual \u2192\n\nAbout \u2022 Mastodon \u2022 Instagram \u2022 GitHub\n\nFeeds & Tags \u2022 Get Captee for macOS \u2022\n\n\u00a9 2009-2024 Charles Y.
