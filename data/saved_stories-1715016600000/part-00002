This is more true for the passenger vehicle segment where cost of\nownership has increased substantially in the past few years.\n\nAn average buyer understands the difference between the ex-showroom price of a\ncar and the actual cost of the vehicle incurred while purchasing it. The\ndifference between the two prices is arbitrary and goes higher as ex-showroom\nprices increase. But one rarely questions how much each manufacturer earns on\nselling one car.\n\n### How much Toyota earns by selling a Fortuner\n\nIf broadly categorized, proceeds of a purchase of a vehicle go to three\nsections- manufacturer, dealer and the government (both State and Central).\nSurprisingly, out of these three, the manufacturer earns the least on sale of\na car. The price bifurcation has been explained in more detail by a video on\nYouTube channel Taxation with CA Sahil Jain.\n\nThe video starts with the example of Toyota Fortuner which is a premium\noffering with an ex-showroom price of Rs 39.28 lakh for which a buyer has to\nshell out approximately Rs 47.35 lakh (on-road) from his/her pocket.\nConsidering the high price, one would imagine that Toyota could be earning a\nbig chunk of it which is not true. The company only earns about Rs\n35,000-40,000 per vehicle, even as premium as Fortuner.\n\n### Dealerships, Government Earn More Than Manufacturer\n\nA dealership, through which the vehicle has been sold to the customer, earns a\ncommission of 2.5-5 percent on each car\u2019s ex-showroom. In Fortuner\u2019s case, a\nToyota dealer would earn approximately Rs 1 lakh on sale of each unit. This\nfigure also varies from company to company since each OEM offers different\ncommissions to its dealership.\n\nMajority of the proceeds go to governments at both State and Central levels\nthrough various components of taxes. Taking the example mentioned above, out\nof the ex-showroom price of Fortuner, approximately Rs 13 lakh goes to the\ngovernment. This includes two GST components- GST at 28 percent and GST\ncompensation cess at 22 percent. Both amount to Rs 5.72 lakh and Rs 7.28 lakh\nrespectively in case of the D-segment SUV.\n\nIn the on-road price as well, charges for Registration, road tax, green cess\n(for diesel vehicles) and fast tag go to the government. Therefore, the total\ncontribution made by a consumer to the government on purchase of a Fortuner\nstands at around Rs 18 lakh (approx.). All price components mentioned above\nare rough figures but do give us an idea of the ballpark figure.\n\n### Operating Profits Of Major Brands\n\nThis should explain why carmakers find it difficult to churn out an operating\nprofit per car since the bulk of the proceeds goes to the government. Among\nthe mass market segment, Kia has the highest operating profit per car at\naround Rs 70,000. Maruti and Tata have an operating profit of around Rs\n40,000-45,000 per car whereas Hyundai earns a profit of around Rs 30,000 per\ncar.\n\nAbove numbers are approximated on the basis of respective company\u2019s operating\nannual report. Apart from car sales, profit figures also include sales of\nspare parts, etc. Profit figure of Toyota mentioned above is after including\nall the expenses (salaries, marketing, plant investment, etc), whereas in the\ncase of dealer, it is the approximate commission received per car sold\n(excluding expenses, salaries, dealership upkeep, etc).\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\n#### ABOUT US\n\nStarted in 2008, RushLane is India's leading auto news website.
