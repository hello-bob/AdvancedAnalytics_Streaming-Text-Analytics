This was great for traders, because\nthere was just so much trading in crypto. Apart from, like, money laundering\nfor North Korea, the main use case for crypto seems to have been creating new\nthings for people to trade.\n\nNow people are excited about AI. This is less great for traders, because\nthere\u2019s much less trading. Sure, AI has driven changes in public equity prices\nand created lots of startups, but it hasn\u2019t created anything new for traders\nto trade.\n\nBut many traders are also interested in matrix multiplication, and so some of\nthese people are starting to ask: can we financialise chips and compute?\n\nAt the moment, you can really only buy these things on the spot market or lock\nin a long term contract. Is it possible to create a liquid market for options,\nfutures, and other more esoteric derivatives, to give people financial\nexposure to the underlying assets? Who\u2019s going to be the FTX of AI?\n\nI\u2019m not an expert on either semiconductors or trading; I\u2019m getting myself into\nserious Gell-Mann amnesia territory here. But this is a fascinating topic, so\nI\u2019m going to write about it anyway.\n\nBut in doing so, I\u2019ll restrict myself to the past - and specifically to\ndiscussing Enron\u2019s short-lived attempt to trade memory-chip futures in 2001.\nFirst I\u2019ll give a bit of background on the semiconductor industry; then I\u2019ll\ndiscuss what happened and what, if anything, we can learn from it.\n\n## Chips Put Chips In Pockets\n\nThe semiconductor industry is massive: $45bn revenue in 1988, $204bn in 2000,\nand $574bn in 2022. It breaks down into three main segments: memory,\nmicroprocessors and logic. Memory chips accounted for 34% of total revenue in\n1996, and 30% in 2017. The two main types of memory chips are DRAMs and NAND\nflash.\n\n  * DRAMs manage data, but require power.\n\n  * NAND flashes store data, and don\u2019t require power.\n\nThe DRAM market is 1.2-2x bigger than NAND flash, but it\u2019s cyclical, and\nprices are very volatile. It works a bit like the oil industry: companies\nreinvest their profits into capex for next-generation chips, and that creates\na glut that drives down prices. But it\u2019s actually even more volatile than the\noil industry, because chip manufacturers can\u2019t scale back production - they\nhave to operate fabs at 100% capacity.\n\nIt\u2019s a brutally competitive industry, and has consolidated significantly over\nthe past 30 years. It\u2019s currently dominated by three giant firms: Samsung\n($365bn, Korea) Micron ($118bn, USA) and SK Hynix ($91bn, Korea). Small firms\ngo bust or get bought in a downturn - for instance, Texas Instruments sold\ntheir memory chip business to Micron for $800m in 1998.\n\nMoore\u2019s Law drives down memory costs - there\u2019s a learning curve.\n\nEvery few years, you get a higher-capacity memory chip: these two charts show,\nfor each DRAM generation:\n\n  1. Exponential decline in average sale price (ASP)\n\n  2. Rising and falling sale volumes\n\n## Silex Quondam Silexque Futurus\n\nA Forbes article called DRAMs \u201cboring commodity technology that is largely\ntaken for granted\u201d; that means you can swap out a Samsung DRAM for an\nequivalent Micron one without noticing the difference.\n\nOn one side of the DRAM market you have the chip manufacturers; on the other,\nyou have Dell and Compaq and GE, people that make laptops and kettles and car\nradios. And so the market\u2019s inherent price volatility implies demand for some\nway to hedge out price risk.\n\nThere are two basic ways to do this: forwards and futures. See here for more\ndetails, but the key points are:\n\n  1. Forward contracts are negotiated individually; futures are standardised\n\n  2. Forward contracts are often settled with physical delivery of the commodity; futures are normally settled financially (by paying the difference between the contracted price and the spot price at the time of expiry.\n\nIf all you want to do is hedge price risk, then futures are better than\nforwards.\n\nToday, you can trade oil futures; you used to be able to trade egg futures,\nonion futures, and Maine potato futures; but some commodities have never had a\nfutures contract.\n\nDRAMs were and are the best candidate in the entire semiconductor industry for\ncommodity futures.\n\nIn 1989, the San Francisco-based Pacific Stock Exchange proposed a DRAM\nfutures market; the Minneapolis Twin Cities Board of Trade were also thinking\nalong the same lines. The PSE submitted an application to the CFTC to start\ntrading by Q2 1990, but it went nowhere.\n\nIn 2001, Enron was fresh from making markets in gas and power, and was looking\nto find ever more esoteric places to become a middleman - even the rates paid\nto publishers by advertisers! Buoyed by the dot-com boom, they announced a\nplan to create a DRAM futures market, as the first step towards making markets\nfor a whole range of computer components, including LCDs.\n\n> \u201cThe [DRAM] chip market is a boom or bust cycle, with prices very high or\n> very low. It's the perfect market. And Enron has the credibility. ... We'd\n> like to hedge maybe 60% of a computer, if possible, in the long term. That's\n> our plan.\"\n\nKenneth Wang (director of Enron's global semiconductor group), 2001\n\nThis also didn\u2019t go anywhere - and Enron entered bankruptcy in November 2001.\nBecause the firm booked all its future revenues up front (using mark-to-market\naccounting) and was compelled by Wall Street to show steady 15% year-on-year\nearnings growth, Enron was desperate for new projects to finance - in order to\nbook those revenues and hit earnings targets. Each year, the pressure\nratcheted up; and so I think the attempt to create chip futures is best\nunderstood as a last-ditch attempt to find a new market to enter - rather than\na genuine belief in the soundness of the market.\n\nBut in 2001 Buckaroo.com, a broker in the secondary market for DRAMs, proposed\nsomething similar; and in 2003, a US group called SFX and a Singaporean group\ncalled SGX independently did the same thing. None of their attempts got off\nthe ground. No DRAM futures were ever traded.\n\nIn August 2004, an English entrepreneur filed a patent for technology to\ncreate a DRAM futures exchange; and, remarkably, in March 2004, a patent was\nfiled to create a futures exchange in fab capacity for TSMC. Nothing came of\nthese either!\n\nSo why is this such a hard problem? Well, there are three main challenges for\nanyone looking to create a futures market.\n\n  1. The unit-of-sale problem\n\n  2. Liquidity\n\n  3. Regulation\n\nThe biggest reason DRAM futures failed was the unit-of-sale problem. Liquidity\nwas an issue too, but to a lesser degree. And all this happened in a lax\nregulatory environment; since Dodd-Frank, it\u2019s much harder to anything with\nderivatives. For that reason, it seems unlikely that anyone will ever manage\nto build a chip futures exchange.\n\n## Unit-of-Sale\n\nForward contracts are negotiated ad-hoc, but futures contracts are\nstandardised. To create one, you need to agree on:\n\n  1. The definition of the underlying commodity (e.g. Brent, WTI)\n\n  2. The contract unit (e.g. 100 troy ounces, or 1,000 barrels)\n\n  3. The legal terms and conditions.\n\nGetting this done is manageable for agricultural or mineral commodities - for\ninstance, the NYMEX introduced standard oil futures in 1983. But for chips,\nthe unit-of-sale problem seems insurmountable, primarily because new chip\nmodels come out every few years.\n\n  * In 1989, the PSE proposed trading in 256 KB and 1 MB chips.\n\n  * In 2001, Enron proposed a contract unit of 25,000 128MB chips.\n\n  * In 2003, a Singaporean exchange called SGX proposed a contract unit of 10,000 256MB chips. You can read the details of that contract here.\n\nYou can see today\u2019s spot and forward contract DRAM prices here; the listed\nchips are 4GB and 8GB. This dynamic alone makes it really difficult to build a\nsustainable futures exchange. But there are other problems:\n\n  1. Size isn\u2019t everything; other attributes matter too. As analyst Sherry Garber put it in 2001, \u201cIt's impossible to come up with a so-called commodity DRAM with fit, form, and function that serves all memory applications\u201d; in 2003, she said that \u201cyou can have a standard density, a standard type, and a standard configuration, but you can have infinite combinations of those\u201d.\n\nThe SGX contract is actually for a \u201c256Mb Double Data Rate Synchronous DRAM,\n32M x 8, PC266 and above, 66 pins TSOP2, taped & reel.\u201d, with a specific SKU\nfor Samsung, Micron and Hynix. At this point, we\u2019re not trading a commodity,\nwe\u2019re trading a specific product.\n\n  2. Market participants didn\u2019t want to admit that their chips were commodities. For instance Tom Quinn, a Samsung VP based in San Jose, commented in 2001 that: \u201cDRAM is not perfectly fungible; It's not like if Compaq doesn't want it, you can push it to Dell.\u201d\n\nBut I think he was being disingenuous. Someone involved in the 1989 effort\ntold me that it was the manufacturers, not Compaq and Dell, who didn\u2019t want to\nadmit that their products were interchangeable. That makes more sense - Dell\nwould really like to commoditise their inputs, in order to have suppliers\ncompete on price.\n\nAs a result, it makes sense that consumers of microchips would be more willing\nto engage in a futures market than manufacturers.\n\nSo there\u2019s variation over time between chip sizes, and also within chip sizes,\nbased both on technical specs and (to some extent) the OEM themselves.\n\n> \u201cI would think trading in futures on D-RAM's is a little nuts. If it's an\n> attempt to dampen availability swings, every cycle has a different product\n> in it. Does the Pacific Stock Exchange intend to trade in futures on every\n> hot new product the chip industry puts out as it goes through its boom-bust\n> cycle?\u201d\n\nCharles M. Clough, president of the biggest semiconductor broker on the West\nCoast (and hence someone with an angle!), 1989\n\n> \u201cThe problem is that DRAMs are an unstable commodity that undergoes a wide\n> variety of fundamental product changes over time. We believe the inherent\n> instability of the offering renders forward contracts impractical\u201d\n\nDan Scovel, (industry analyst commenting on Enron\u2019s proposal), 2001\n\n> \u201cIt's such a logical idea\u2013in theory, it's brilliant, but it just doesn't\n> work. DRAM is a natural candidate for futures trading, because it's the most\n> commodity-like of all semiconductors, but it's not a pure commodity.\u201d\n\nGrant Johnson (industry analyst), 2003\n\n## Liquidity\n\nExchanges are great, because they make 1. trades happen faster, and 2. spreads\ntighter. But to make them work, you need people on both sides who want to\nhedge out price risk, plus speculators/market makers. Ideally, you want a\nfragmented set of buyers and sellers.\n\nTherefore, the increasing consolidation among DRAM manufacturers has made the\nindustry less suitable for a futures exchange. In 1989, a PSE spokesman said\nthat the same 256MB DRAM chip could be produced by 17 different manufacturers;\ntoday, that number is effectively down to 3. If one side of the market is too\nconsolidated, then it\u2019s very difficult to build a futures market:\n\n> Oil derivatives weren't a complete novelty: futures and options had existed\n> a century earlier, in the years after commercial production began in the US\n> in 1859. For a brief period, oil futures were traded on at least twenty\n> exchanges across the US. But the primitive market for oil derivatives like\n> the spot trade in physical oil came to an end when Rockefeller won control\n> of the industry.\n\nJack Farchy & Javier Blas, The World For Sale\n\nRockefeller\u2019s Standard Oil established a near monopoly on pipelines, refining,\nand retail distribution; and so the wildcatters and production companies who\ntook on the risk of striking oil in the first place were firmly in the\nposition of price-takers. If you\u2019ve got a monopsony, prices can be whatever\nyou want them to be - who needs futures?\n\nAs a rule, marketplaces will find it easier to attract one side of the market\nthan the other. And in theory, both sides should benefit; just as nickel\nmanufacturers buy nickel futures, it should have made sense for Samsung to buy\nchip futures. But in the case of DRAM futures, the challenge was to get the\nmanufacturers on board.\n\nFor instance, a Texas Instruments spokesman wrote in 1989 that:\n\n> \u201cWe're trying to stabilize the market, but rather than go with a futures\n> market, we're going to the core of the problem and working more closely with\n> customers. I don't see how this could benefit us right now.\n\nIn other words, he was happy to ink bilateral forwards contracts; he didn\u2019t\nwant futures.\n\nAnd in 2003, a Micron spokesman said this:\n\n> \u201cWe typically don't adjust production based on market needs from a cost\n> perspective. We generally run at 100% capacity to keep our fixed cost down.\u201d\n\nThe second statement makes sense; it makes sense for oil wells and diamond\nmines to reduce production of a finite resource in order to prop up prices,\nbut that\u2019s not the case for semiconductors.\n\nThe first statement is less clear to me. I think a producer might prefer\nforwards to futures for two main reasons:\n\n  1. Customer relationships: producers don\u2019t want to sell a commodity, they want to sell a personalised product to a customer with whom they have a long-term relationship. Differentiating on things other than price keeps prices higher. This argument is of course much stronger if the futures exchange doesn\u2019t effectively solve the unit-of-sale problem.\n\n  2. New entrants: if producers have direct customer relationships, they don\u2019t want to let someone else take a cut; and even worse, they don\u2019t want to give speculators room to manipulate the market. For instance, after Siegel and Kosuma manipulated the Chicago onion futures market in 1955, Congress prohibited onion futures at the request of the growers.\n\nSo, descriptively, it seems that the 1989 and 2001 efforts to create chip\nfutures failed because they didn\u2019t get chip manufacturers on board. This might\njust be what the kids call a skill issue - it\u2019s possible that neither PSE nor\nEnron were very good at negotiating with the chaebols (I learned that word\nthis week and I\u2019m very pleased with it).\n\nThe chip market is idiosyncratic; typically, futures markets for agricultural\ncommodities have more difficulty convincing consumers than producers. But when\nEnron set out to reform the gas market in the late 1980s, they also struggled\nto sign up producers. Although oil futures were traded on the NYMEX from 1983,\n75% of American natural gas changed hands in the spot market in the last few\ndays of the month. Both producers and consumers took on significant price\nrisk, and neither used forward contracts. Enron\u2019s solution was not a bona fide\nexchange, but rather to act as a middleman, capturing a spread - this was the\nGas Bank.\n\nBut while consumers - e.g.utilities piping gas into homes - were happy to sign\ncontracts in order to guarantee supply, producers were much less willing. The\nmostly Texan exploration and production (E&P) companies were inveterate\noptimists, and expected prices to rise indefinitely. They took the same\napproach to risk management as another Southern legend:\n\n> One time the macro men feared that the markets would turn against their\n> European bond position in the short term, and they advised Robertson to\n> protect Tiger from losses by putting on a temporary hedge.\n>\n> \u201cHedge?\u201d Robertson retorted angrily. \u201cHey-edge? Why, that just means that if\n> I\u2019m right I\u2019m going to make less money.\u201d\n>\n> \u201cWell, that\u2019s right,\u201d the macro men answered him.\n>\n> \u201cWhy would I want to do that? Why? Why? That\u2019s just dirt under my\n> fingernails.\u201d\n>\n> That was the end of that attempt at risk management.\n\nSebastian Mallaby, More Money than God\n\nHowever, there was something of a credit crunch in Texas at the time, and\nbanks were unwilling to lend to the E&Ps. As such, Jeff Skilling offered to\npay producers up front for the value of the contract - in effect creating a\nmixed swap, adding a bet on interest rates to the bet on gas. With the Gas\nBank offering real financial help, the producers were much more interested,\nand Enron was able to successfully build out the gas future market.\n\n## Regulation\n\nIn 1974, Jimmy Carter created the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The\nCFTC\u2019s predecessor, the CEA, only had authority over agricultural commodities;\nthe CFTC would regulate all exchange-traded futures.\n\nThat left some pretty significant grey areas - including forward contracts.\nWhile the CFTC got some oversight over market participants, they had no\njurisdiction over the OTC forward contracts that sophisticated participants\nengaged in. And crucially, one flavour of OTC forward contract was interest\nrate swaps. If one party has floating-rate debt, and one party has fixed-rate\nbet, banks could facilitate an interest rate swap between them, in order to\nhedge the risk; but without CFTC oversight, these transactions were\nunregulated.\n\nBy the time the government realised what was happening in the swaps market, it\nwas so big that nobody was sure whether it could be safely unravelled without\ncausing a mass sell-off. And so off-balance-sheet swaps and derivatives\nremained beyond the reach of the CFTC.\n\nMost of Enron\u2019s trading in the 1980s and 1990s consisted of these OTC\nderivatives; since they didn\u2019t happen on the NYMEX or Chicago Merc, the CFTC\nhad no idea what was going on. Furthermore, the 2000 Commodity Futures\nModernization Act confirmed the exemption of digital futures exchanges from\nCFTC regulation.\n\nThat was fantastic, because on November 29, 1999, Enron had launched Enron\nOnline - a digital marketplace for energy futures contracts. Rather than\nphoning someone up, traders could trade by hitting a trade - except that in\nevery single trade, Enron was the counterparty. Given that context, the\nexemption makes more sense: Enron wasn\u2019t really running a digital exchange for\nthird parties; it was acting as the counterparty for lots of digitally-\nexecuted forward contracts.\n\nIn 2000, this all looked great. The dotcom bubble was expanding, Enron was a\ngrowth stock, and American commerce was booming. But Enron\u2019s collapse, and the\nsubsequent unravelling of tens of billions of off-balance-sheet swaps and\nderivatives, changed public perceptions somewhat.\n\nThat negative attitude to swaps was exacerbated by the collapse of the energy\nhedge fund Amaranth in 2006; and in 2007, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on\nInvestigations released a report titled \u2018The Role of Market Speculation in\nRising Oil and Gas Prices: A Need to Put the Cop Back on the Beat\u2019. It blamed\nspeculation in unregulated commodities futures for raising consumer prices,\nand recommended the closing of the \u2018Enron Loophole\u2019 in the 2000 CFMA - which\nleft electronic futures exchanges unregulated.\n\nOf course, worse was to come - in the aftermath of the 2008 GFC, \u201cswaps\u201d,\nespecially when they were of the credit default variety, became somewhat non\ngrata. And so the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, one of the main legislative responses\nto the financial crisis, finally brought OTC derivatives under the purview of\nthe SEC and CFTC. This allows them to audit and approve individual contracts,\nimposing things like position limits.\n\nThe point of all this is to say that 1989 and 2001 were particularly good\ntimes to be an innovator in commodity futures. Not only was the CFTC\nrelatively toothless, the internet was still the Wild West. Post Dodd-Frank,\nthese things are much more tightly regulated.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMy takeaways from the history of DRAM futures are straightforward:\n\n  1. People tried to make the market;\n\n  2. They never solved the unit-of-sale problem;\n\n  3. They never got chip manufacturers on board;\n\n  4. And all this happened in a favourable regulatory environment, which is now gone.\n\nKenneth Wang\u2019s ambition (hubris?) was striking: \u201cWe'd like to hedge maybe 60%\nof a computer, if possible, in the long term. That's our plan.\u201d This is the\nsort of thing FTX went around saying; the intellectual purity of the idea was\nwhat made it so Enron. Of course this market was dumb; of course he would be\nthe man to solve it. With logic, maths, and stacks of cash (well, in Enron\u2019s\ncase, not much actual real cash), messy reality could be tamed.\n\nIt didn\u2019t work out for them. But the lesson, I think, is not that taming\nreality with logic, maths and cash is a bad idea: it worked for Uber! Rather,\nI think the story of DRAMs sets a lower bound; if it didn\u2019t work in that\nmarket, then you better know why your market is better suited for\nfinancialisation.\n\n> Fortis vero animi et constantis est non perturbari in rebus asperis nec\n> tumultuantem de gradu deici, ut dicitur, sed praesenti animo uti et consilio\n> nec a ratione discedere.
