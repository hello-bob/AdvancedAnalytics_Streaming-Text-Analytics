Every four years, this number is cut in half.\nThe day the amount halves is called a \"halving\" or \"halvening\".\n\n  * In the 2012 halving, the amount of new bitcoins (BTC) issued every 10 minutes dropped from 50 bitcoins to 25.\n  * In 2016, it dropped from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC.\n  * In the most recent May 11, 2020 halving, the reward dropped from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC per block.\n\nIn the 2024 halving, the reward will drop from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125\nBTC.\n\n## What is the Significance of the Bitcoin Block Halving?\n\nThe halving decreases the amount of new bitcoins generated per block. This\nmeans the supply of new bitcoins is lower, making buying more expensive.\n\nIn normal markets, lower supply with steady demand usually leads to higher\nprices. Since the halving reduces the supply of new bitcoins, and demand\nusually remains steady, the halving has usually preceded some of Bitcoin's\nlargest runs.\n\nIn the image below, the vertical blue lines indicate the previous three\nhalvings (2012-11-28, 2016-7-9, and 2020-5-11). Note how the price has jumped\nsignificantly after each halving. You can also view our live halving progress\nchart.\n\n## Bitcoin Halving Chart\n\nIn the image below, you can see Bitcoin's inflation rate during each period.\n\nEach halving lowers Bitcoin's inflation rate. The orange line is Bitcoin's\ninflation rate during a given period, while the blue line is the total number\nof bitcoins issued.\n\n## Bitcoin Halving Schedule\n\nThe Bitcoin halving is scheduled in block height, not date.\n\nThe halving happens every 210,000 blocks. The 2024 halving will happen on\nblock 840,000.\n\n## What Happens to Miners During Halvings?\n\nMany always speculate that miners will shut down after the halving. The\nreality is most miners are very smart and price in the halving, so they don't\nend up shutting down any miners.\n\n## When is the 2024 Bitcoin Halving?\n\nThe 2024 halving will likely occur in April 2024. There is a small chance it\nwill happen in either March or May. Our most updated estimate is displayed at\nthe top of this page.\n\n## Bitcoin Halving Dates History\n\nThis section will take a look at the previous three halvings.\n\n## 2012 Halving\n\nThe 2012 block halving was the first halving and happened on November 28th,\n2012. The halving block was mined by SlushPool by someone using a Radeon HD\n5800 miner.\n\n  * New BTC Per Block Before: 50 BTC per block\n  * New BTC Per Block After: 25 BTC per block\n  * Price on Halving Day: $12.35\n  * Price 150 Days Later: $127.00\n\n## 2016 Halving\n\nThe 2016 halving was Bitcoin's second halving and occurred on July 9th, 2016.\n\n  * New BTC Per Block Before: 25 BTC per block\n  * New BTC Per Block After: 12.5 BTC per block\n  * Price on Halving Day: $650.63\n  * Price 150 Days Later: $758.81\n\n## 2020 Halving\n\nThe 2020 halving was the third halving occurred on May 11, 2020.\n\n  * New BTC Per Block Before: 12.5 BTC per block\n  * New BTC Per Block After: 6.25 BTC per block\n  * Price on Halving Day: $8821.42\n  * Price 150 Days Later: $10,943.00\n\n## Halving Calculator\n\nEnter a custom block time and get an estimate of the 2024 halving date.\n\n### Estimates based on your block time:\n\nLatest Block:\n\n2024 Halving Block:\n\nEstimated 2024 Halving Date:\n\n## 2028 through 2060 Halving Date Estimates\n\nWe'll adjust this based on block times, but as of now here are the estimates\nfor the 2028 through 2060 Bitcoin halvings.\n\nHalving Year| Estimated Date (UTC)  \n---|---  \n2028 halving| April 10, 2028  \n2032 halving| April 14, 2032  \n2036 halving| April 18, 2036  \n2040 halving| April 21, 2040  \n2044 halving| April 25, 2044  \n2048 halving| April 29, 2048  \n2052 halving| May 2, 2052  \n2056 halving| May 6, 2056  \n2060 halving| May 10, 2060  \n  \n## Current Bitcoin Block Subsidy\n\nThe current Bitcoin block subsidy is 6.25 bitcoins per block. When block\n840,000 is hit in 2024, the subsidy will drop to 3.125 bitcoins (BTC) per\nblock.\n\n## Bitcoin Halving Parties\n\nThere is a major Bitcoin halving party happening in El Salvador in April.\nVisit bitcoinhalvingparty.com for more info.\n\n## When Will All 21 Million Bitcoins be Mined?\n\nAll 21 million bitcoins (BTC) will be mined by 2140. But more than 98% will be\nmined by 2030.\n\n## What is the Bitcoin Clock?\n\nThe Bitcoin clock has been around since 2011. In 2018, the owner let the\ndomain expire. We revamped the site and restored it to its original vision.\n\n## Is the Halving Necessary?\n\nThe halving is necessary. This is how Bitcoin controls its supply. Once the\nblock subsidy expires, transaction fees will be paid to miners for securing\nthe network.\n\n## Why Our Estimates Are the Most Accurate\n\nMost of the other halving date estimators use 10-minute blocks to calculate\nthe estimated halving date.\n\nBlocks, however, have been mined at less than 10-minute intervals for almost\nall of Bitcoin's history.\n\nOur calculator uses live blockchain data to get the average block time for the\npast two months. We then use this block time (currently 9.3583 minutes between\nblocks) to estimate the halving date.\n\nWhile most of the other sites estimate the halving for May, the more likely\noutcome is an April 2024 reward halving.\n\n## What is the Current Bitcoin Block Reward?\n\nCurrently, there are 6.25 new bitcoins issued per block.\n\nBitcoin Clock - a project by Bitbo\n\nBack To Top\n\n", "frontpage": false}
