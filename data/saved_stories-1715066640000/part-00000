(An interesting caveat: lately I\u2019m seeing more of a second category\nof referral candidate, who are running their own extremely systematic\ninterviewing process, with the aim of getting offers from three or more\ncompanies, and consequently tend to have much lower acceptance rates.)\n\nReferrals come with two major drawbacks.\n\nThe first is that your personal network will always be quite small, especially\nwhen you consider the total candidate pool. This is especially true early in\nyour career, but it\u2019s easy to work for a long time without building out a\nlarge personal network if you work in a smaller market or at a series of small\ncompanies (one of the side benefits of working at a large company early in\nyour career, beyond name recognition, is kickstarting your personal network).\n\nThe other issue is that folks tend to have relatively uniform networks\ncomposed of the folks they went to school with or worked with. By hiring\nwithin those circles, it\u2019s easy to end up with a company that thinks, believes\nand sometimes even looks similarly.\n\n## Moving beyond your personal networks\n\nMany hiring managers freeze up when their referral network starts to dry up or\nas they look to bring a wider set of backgrounds onto their teams, but the\ngood news is that there is a simple answer: cold sourcing. Cold sourcing, a\ntechnique that\u2019s also common in some kinds of sales, is reaching out directly\nto folks you don\u2019t know.\n\nIf you\u2019re introverted, this will probably be an extremely unsettling\nexperience at first, with questions like \u201cWhat if they\u2019re annoyed by my email?\nWhat if I\u2019m wasting their time?\u201d ringing in your head. These are important\nquestions, and we have an obligation to be thoughtful about how we inject\nourselves into others\u2019 lives. I was personally paralyzed by this concern\ninitially, but ultimately I think it was unfounded: a concise, thoughtful\ninvitation to discuss a job opportunity is an opportunity, not an\ninfringement, especially for folks who are on career networking sites like\nLinkedIn. Most folks will ignore you (which is great), others will politely\ndemur (also great), a few will actually respond (even greater), and a\nsurprisingly amount will ignore you for six months and then pop up mentioning\nthat they\u2019re starting a new job search: I\u2019ve never had someone respond\nunkindly.\n\nThe other great thing about cold sourcing is that it\u2019s pretty straightforward,\nand I\u2019ll share the approach I\u2019ve used, with the caveat that I believe there\nare a tremendous number of different approaches that are probably more\neffective. Take this as a good starting point, track your results, and then\nexperiment!\n\n## Your first cold sourcing recipe\n\nMy standard approach to cold sourcing is:\n\n  1. Join LinkedIn. I suspect variations of this technique would work on other networks (e.g. Github), but the challenge is that folks on other networks are generally not looking to engage about employment opportunities, and intent increases response rate significantly! (A good parallel here is search versus display advertising, where search advertising has an order of magnitude higher click-through rates as folks are actually searching for what they\u2019re being advertised.)\n\n  2. Build out your network by following folks you actually do know. Add everyone that you went to school with, have worked with, have interacted with on Twitter, etc. It\u2019s important to seed your network with some people you know because it\u2019ll increase the reach of your second degree network, and it\u2019ll also reduce the rate at which folks mark you as someone they don\u2019t know (which is an input to being penalized as a spammer).\n\n  3. Be patient. If your initial network is small, it\u2019s very likely that you\u2019ll get throttled pretty frequently. Once you\u2019re throttled (you\u2019ll get a message along the lines of \u201cyou\u2019ve exceeded your search capacity for this month\u201d), you\u2019ll have to wait for a few days, potentially until the next month, to unthrottle. (Alternatively, you could sign up for their premium products, which would accelerate this quite a bit.) It may take weeks or months of occasional effort (schedule an hour each week) to get your network large enough that you\u2019re able to perform more than a few searches without ratelimiting. Anecdotally, the number of connections where things seem to get easier is around six hundred or so.\n\n  4. Use the search function to identify second degree connections to connect to with. Start out by searching in your 2nd degree network by job title, software engineer or engineering manager, and as your network expands consider switching from title to company. (Consider the various lists of great companies to find companies to search by.) Build a broadchurch of connections! Even folks whom you end up not reaching out to now are folks who might reach out to you later, or that you might reach out to in a few months as your hiring priorities change. If you\u2019re not sure, just go ahead and do it.\n\n  5. When someone accepts your connection request, grab their email address from their profile and send them a short, polite note inviting them to coffee or a phone call, and sharing with them a link to your job description. Experiment with varying degrees of customization. (If you\u2019re having trouble finding their email, make sure you click \u201cShow more\u201d in their \u201cContact and Personal Info\u201d section, and that they\u2019re a first degree connection. A few folks don\u2019t share their email at all, and I\u2019d recommend moving on, alternatively you could send them a LinkedIn message directly.) I\u2019ve personally found that customization matters less than I assumed, because folks mostly choose to respond based on their circumstances, not the quality of your note. (As a caveat, it\u2019s possible to write bad notes that discourage folks from responding. Iterating on your reach out notes and getting a few other folks with different perspectives to review your note is a quick and high leverage thing to do.)\n\nYour reachout notes can be very straightforward:\n\n    \n        Hi $THEIR_NAME, I'm an engineering manager at $COMPANY, and think you would be a great fit for $ROLE (link to your job description). Would you be willing to grab a coffee or do a phone call to discuss sometime in the next week? Best, $YOUR_NAME\n\nReally, I think it can be that simple! If that seems too simple, then run an\nA/B test with something more personalized or sophisticated.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that you will end up connecting with some folks who you\nsimply don\u2019t have a great fit for right now. That\u2019s ok. I recommend reviewing\ntheir profile pretty rigorously after they accept your connection, and making\nan honest assessment on fit. If you don\u2019t have something, that\u2019s ok, and it\u2019s\na better use of the candidate\u2019s time to not reach out to them. (However, I\nalso think we tend to over filter on qualities that don\u2019t matter too much!\nBeing respectful of the candidate\u2019s time is, in my opinion, the most important\nto optimize for.)\n\n  6. Schedule and enjoy your coffees and chats, and remember that even folks you aren\u2019t able to work with now are still folks you\u2019re likely to work with next year or next job. Especially in Silicon Valley, it\u2019s a very small network, and interact with each person like they\u2019ll be providing feedback on whether or not to hire you at your next job (they very well might!). You have two goals for each of these calls or coffees: figure out if there is good mutual fit between the candidate and the role, and there is a good fit, then try to get them to move forward with your process. The three things I find most useful to folks deciding to move forward with our process are explaining why I personally am excited about the company and role we\u2019re discussing, explain how our process works from our current chat to them receiving an offer, and leaving ample time to ask questions.\n\n  7. Keep spending an hour each week adding more connections and following up with folks who have connected. It\u2019s a bit of a grind at times, but it\u2019s definitely a practice that rewards consistency. I\u2019ve found that this is a good activity to do together! Have a weekly meeting of folks who come together and source, chatting about how you\u2019re evolving your search, and also to keep folks overcome their initial discomfort with cold reachouts. (It\u2019s worth pointing out that this is much easier to with an applicant tracking system like Lever or Greenhouse, which allows you to have a single place to track if a candidate has already been contacted by someone else at your company. Having a bunch of folks from the same company reach out around the same time can paint a picture of chaos.)\n\nIf you\u2019ve read through this, and are quite confident that this approach won\u2019t\nwork, I\u2019m with you: before I tried it, I was similarly certain it wouldn\u2019t\nwork for me, and that it was just a big waste of time, but I\u2019ve slowly been\nconverted. It\u2019s also important to recognize that very likely this exact\napproach won\u2019t perform well over time: try something simple, push through your\nconcerns that block you from starting, and then experiment with different\napproaches.\n\n## Is this high-leverage work?\n\nSimilarly, a frequent followup question is whether sourcing is a high leverage\ntask for engineering managers. I think it is: folks are more excited to chat\nwith someone who\u2019d be managing them then they are to chat with a recruiter who\nthey\u2019ll mostly work with during the interview process, likewise, I think it\u2019s\na valuable signal showing that managers care about hiring enough to invest\ntheir personal energy and attention into it.\n\nThat said, I would be cautiously concerned if an engineering manager was\nspending more than an hour a week on sourcing (not including follow up chats,\nthose will take up a bunch more time), there is a lot of important work to be\ndone closing and evaluating candidates as well, in addition to the numerous\nnon-hiring related opportunities to be helpful.\n\nAs a closing thought, the single clearest indicator of strong recruiting\norganizations is a close, respectful partnership between the recruiting and\nengineering functions. Spending some time cold sourcing is a great way to\nbuild empathy for the challenges that face recruiters on a daily basis, and\nit\u2019s also an awesome opportunity to learn from the recruiters you partner\nwith! We\u2019ve been doing weekly cold sourcing meetings as a partnership between\nour engineering managers and engineering recruiters, and it\u2019s been a great\nforum for learning, empathy building and, of course, hiring.\n\nThanks to Steve, TR and Malthe for reviewing versions of this post.\n\nPublished on January 8, 2018.\n\nHi folks.
