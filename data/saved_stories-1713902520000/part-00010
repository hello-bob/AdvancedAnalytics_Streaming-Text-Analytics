Not to be confused with\nParkinson's law.\n\nThe law of triviality is C. Northcote Parkinson's 1957 argument that people\nwithin an organization commonly give disproportionate weight to trivial\nissues.^[1] Parkinson provides the example of a fictional committee whose job\nwas to approve the plans for a nuclear power plant spending the majority of\nits time on discussions about relatively minor but easy-to-grasp issues, such\nas what materials to use for the staff bicycle shed, while neglecting the\nproposed design of the plant itself, which is far more important and a far\nmore difficult and complex task.\n\nThe law has been applied to software development and other activities.^[2] The\nterms bicycle-shed effect, bike-shed effect, and bike-shedding were coined\nbased on Parkinson's example; it was popularised in the Berkeley Software\nDistribution community by the Danish software developer Poul-Henning Kamp in\n1999^[3] and, due to that, has since become popular within the field of\nsoftware development generally.\n\n## Argument[edit]\n\nA bicycle shed\n\nThe concept was first presented as a corollary of his broader \"Parkinson's\nlaw\" spoof of management. He dramatizes this \"law of triviality\" with the\nexample of a committee's deliberations on an atomic reactor, contrasting it to\ndeliberations on a bicycle shed. As he put it: \"The time spent on any item of\nthe agenda will be in inverse proportion to the sum [of money] involved.\" A\nreactor is so vastly expensive and complicated that an average person cannot\nunderstand it (see ambiguity aversion), so one assumes that those who work on\nit understand it. However, everyone can visualize a cheap, simple bicycle\nshed, so planning one can result in endless discussions because everyone\ninvolved wants to implement their own proposal and demonstrate personal\ncontribution.^[4]\n\nAfter a suggestion of building something new for the community, like a bike\nshed, problems arise when everyone involved argues about the details. This is\na metaphor indicating that it is not necessary to argue about every little\nfeature based simply on having the knowledge to do so. Some people have\ncommented that the amount of noise generated by a change is inversely\nproportional to the complexity of the change.^[3]\n\nBehavioral research has produced evidence which confirms theories proposed by\nthe law of triviality. People tend to spend more time on small decisions than\nthey should, and less time on big decisions than they should. A simple\nexplanation is that during the process of making a decision, one has to assess\nwhether enough information has been collected to make the decision. If people\nmake mistakes about whether they have enough information, then they will tend\nto stop collecting information too early to adequately inform their big\ndecisions. The reason is that big decisions require collecting information for\na long time. It leaves more time to make a mistake (and stop) before getting\nenough information. Conversely, for small decisions, where people should stop\nearly, they may inefficiently continue to ponder for too long.^[5]\n\n## Related principles and formulations [edit]\n\nThere are several other principles, well known in specific problem domains,\nwhich express a similar sentiment.\n\nWadler's law, named for computer scientist Philip Wadler,^[6] is a principle\nwhich asserts that the bulk of discussion on programming-language design\ncenters on syntax (which, for purposes of the argument, is considered a solved\nproblem), as opposed to semantics.\n\nSayre's law is a more general principle, which holds (among other\nformulations) that \"In any dispute, the intensity of feeling is inversely\nproportional to the value of the issues at stake\"; many formulations of the\nprinciple focus on academia.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Analysis paralysis\n  * Attention inequality\n  * Busy work\n  * Dunning\u2013Kruger effect\n  * Fredkin's paradox\n  * Hofstadter's law\n  * How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?\n  * Jevons paradox\n  * List of eponymous laws\n  * Omission bias\n  * Peter principle\n  * Procrastination\n  * Narcissism of small differences\n  * Sayre's Law\n  * Scope neglect\n  * Snackwell effect\n  * Student syndrome\n  * Time management\n  * Tyranny of small decisions\n  * Zero-risk bias\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Parkinson, C.
