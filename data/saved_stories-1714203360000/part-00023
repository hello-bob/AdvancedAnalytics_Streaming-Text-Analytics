Of course, you would.\n\nToo good to be true? Almost. This story centers on an enterprising electronics\nstore that is selling chips from a Gacha machine. Instead of dispensing a\nsmall plastic toy in an egg-shaped bubble, this one provides you with a handy\npiece of Intel hardware.\n\nAs detailed by YouTuber Sawara-San, for the modest sum of 500 Yen (roughly\n$3.25), you can walk away with a CPU, or as many as you want to fill your\npockets with.\n\nFurther testing and diagnosis using Windows Task Manager revealed the Intel\nchip, as with all others on display, comes with significant faults. The Intel\nCore i7-8700 was found to have just five working cores and 10 threads when an\noptimum piece should be fully equipped with six cores and 12 threads.\n\n## What is the point of selling broken Intel chips?\n\nFor the price, no one can complain. It is a bargain, even if you will be\nlimited as to what you can do with the chip, whose full, unbroken version\ncurrently retails for around $200.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a handy way for retailers to recoup some spare cash, given the\nalternative is for the hardware to end up on the scrap heap. This solution\nwon\u2019t be a permanent one, but it isn\u2019t supposed to be. Governments and big\ntech must answer the bigger questions on e-waste but if, meantime, a few chips\ncan find a new home and a longer lifespan, they still serve a purpose.\n\nThe CPUs can also be quaint souvenirs, as it\u2019s not every day that tech\nenthusiasts get their hands on one (or many) of these chips to do with as they\nplease. It\u2019s another novelty idea from vendors known for them, and maybe not\none that interests everyone. Still, what a quirky, fun, and inexpensive way to\nsell broken Intel chips.\n\nImage credit: Ideogram\n\n#### About ReadWrite\u2019s Editorial Process\n\nThe ReadWrite Editorial policy involves closely monitoring the tech industry\nfor major developments, new product launches, AI breakthroughs, video game\nreleases and other newsworthy events.
