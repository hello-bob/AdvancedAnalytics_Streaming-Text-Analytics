It's fast. And it's fun!\n\nTerraform or Bust?\n\nHas your organization used or evaluated a Terraform alternative since new\nrestrictions were placed on its licensing?\n\nWe have used Terraform, but are now piloting or using an open source\nalternative like OpenTofu.\n\nWe never used Terraform, but have recently piloted or used alternatives.\n\nWe don't use Terraform and don't plan to use or evaluate alternatives.\n\nWe use Terraform and are satisfied with the results\n\nWe are waiting to see what IBM will do with Terraform.\n\nWe'd love to hear what you think.\n\nAWS sponsored this post.\n\nSEATTLE \u2014 The free license that Redis offers under its new license is not a\ngreat deal, says the lead contributor to the Valkey project, the new Redis\nfork backed by The Linux Foundation.\n\nYOUTUBE.COM/THENEWSTACK\n\nTech moves fast, don't miss an episode. Subscribe to our YouTube channel to\nstream all our podcasts, interviews, demos, and more.\n\n\u201cSo a lot of people just look at the fact that the new license that Redis is\nputting out is free for end users,\u201d said Madelyn Olson, a former core\ncontributor to the Redis project, in an interview for The New Stack Makers.\nThe episode, which included Valkey maintainers from Google and Oracle. was\nrecorded at the Open Source Summit in April.\n\n\u201cBut what they\u2019re really not seeing is that all of the contributors that\ncurrently worked on Redis often won\u2019t work with that new license,\u201d Olson said.\n\nThe key to any open source project is the people behind it. So far, Valkey has\nemerged fast as a fork with a future. It has 13,000 stars, 43 contributors,\nand technologists leading the project from major cloud services. A contributor\nsummit is in the works.\n\n## \u2018Continuity Is Really the Top Priority\u2019\n\nValkey, an in-memory data store, emerged after Redis, the company, moved the\ncode base to a more restrictive license. \u201cBeginning with version 7.2.4, Redis\nwill be dual-licensed under the Redis Source Available License (RSALv2) and\nServer Side Public License (SSPLv1),\u201d wrote Joab Jackson in The New Stack.\n\u201cOlder versions will remain open source.\u201d\n\nNow a Valkey maintainer, Olson works at Amazon Web Services (AWS). Her work\nreflects the new project\u2019s importance for the world\u2019s largest tech companies,\nas evident in Google and Oracle\u2019s roles as maintainers on Valkey. Joining\nOlson for our conversation were Ping Xie, a Google staff software engineer,\nand Dmitry Polyakovsky, a consulting member of Oracle\u2019s technical staff.\n\n\u201cA lot of the big companies are looking for free open source permissive\nlicenses to work with and contribute to,\u201d Olson said. \u201cSo the end user will\nreally just see less contributions to the product that they\u2019re currently\nusing. And they\u2019ll see slower bug fixes, slower momentum overall.\u201d\n\nSince its inception, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been the best place for\ncustomers to build and run open source software in the cloud. AWS is proud to\nsupport open source projects, foundations, and partners.\n\nLearn More\n\nThe latest from AWS\n\nEnhancing Network Resilience with Istio on Amazon EKS\n\n6 May 2024\n\nFlowpipe: A Cloud Scripting Engine for DevOps Workflows\n\n30 April 2024\n\nLean Into Verified Software Development\n\n8 April 2024\n\nNow the work turns to continuity, modules such as one for Rust, and the core\nengine itself to keep performance strong.\n\n\u201cContinuity is really the top priority, we want to make sure there\u2019s a smooth\npath for everyone who is currently on Redis 7.2.5,\u201d Xie said.\n\nTRENDING STORIES\n\n  1.

The next major\nrelease will come by the end of the year. The goal is one major version per\nyear, with a three-year maintenance cycle.\n\n## Modules and the Client Ecosystem\n\nValkey will emphasize modules to extend its overall functionality. Valkey has\na rich ecosystem of various libraries, but you have to work in C. Developing\nmodules in Rust could help attract more engineers.\n\n\u201cRedis itself has been supporting modules for about six years,\u201d Polyakovsky\nsaid. \u201cThere have been some modules built and, ironically, some of them were\nlicensed differently. So you couldn\u2019t use them as easily as a Redis itself.\nBut I think there can be very interesting new features built into Valkey, but\nthey might not belong in the core Valkey. So they can be built as modules.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s always discussion of using new technologies that complement Valkey.\n\n\u201cSo what about building a vector similarity search module?\u201d Polyakovsky asked.\n\u201cWhat about building a module to do maybe secondary indexes, all kinds of\nthings you can do with Redis or Valkey, with the right module, but keeping the\ncore functionality the same? So that keeps that continuity that gives us\ncompatibility. And the people who choose to use additional new features that\nwould install modules and they would then use those modules only for what they\nneed.\u201d\n\nContinuity comes in many forms.\n\n\u201cFor instance, there are many different types of implementation on the client\nside,\u201d Xie said. \u201cAnd then they do things differently. So those differences in\nthe behavior sometimes confuse the customer. So being able to help the client\necosystem to consolidate on those behaviors will be a big plus for everybody.\u201d\n\nCheck out the full episode for more on the maintainers\u2019 plans for Valkey.\n\nAlex Williams is founder and publisher of The New Stack.
