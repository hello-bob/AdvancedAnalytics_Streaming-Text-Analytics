Suddenly I'm\nseeing this everywhere \u2013 people talking about lying in interviews like it's\nfine and normal. I am writing this in the hopes that I will be able to\nexorcise this demon and go back to my blissful pre-Reddit state where I\nbelieve that most people are honest most of the time.\n\n(Yes, yes, people lie all the time \u2013 but I want to believe that it's rare that\npeople are doing it as a deliberate strategy.)\n\nHi, by the way\u2013 I'm Nat Bennett, and you're reading Simpler Machines, a\nnewsletter that's mostly about software development but like, the messy people\nparts of software development.\n\nI didn't understand what it was going to do to me when I read it so I didn't\nsave the exact thread but this gives you a general idea of the tone.\n\nIn it people say things like\n\n  * \"I have no line.\"\n  * \"Do companies have any lines?\"\n  * \"There's no line, only believability.\"\n  * \"Don\u2019t lie about shit that\u2019ll come back to screw you over basically. Otherwise anything goes.\"\n\nFuck, people.\n\nLive footage of me, reading this garbage:\n\nBatman, breaking a rifle, says, \"This is the weapon of the enemy. We do not\nneed it. We will not use it\".\n\nI'm somewhat sympathetic to the \"man I need the job\" line but this \"well a\nmanager lied to me first?\" thing \u2013 just play the fucking tape forward. Just\nput your anti-capitalist self-righteousness on hold for one goddamned second\nand think. If your model is \"it's okay to lie if I've been lied to\" then we're\nall knee deep in bullshit forever and can never escape Transaction Cost Hell.\n\nIt's not that I think this is easy or fair. And I don't mean \"adopt a rigid\nand expansive definition of 'lie' that stops you from engaging in normal human\nsocial interactions.\"\n\nBut lying deliberately, as a strategy, will fuck you up, and it will fuck you\nup in ways that you don't even see. You will live in a world where everyone\nlies, all the time \u2013 because people who value integrity won't work with you.\nYou will lose track of your self.\n\nOkay. Phew. Is it out of my system? I hope it's out of my system.\n\nWhile this is mostly self-indulgent nonsense, I do have a bit of actual advice\nthat probably someone reading this is still early enough in their career that\nthey haven't heard it yet.\n\nIf you want to be the kind of person who walks away from your job when you're\nasked to do something that doesn't fit your values, you need to save money.\nYou need to maintain low fixed expenses.\n\nActing with integrity \u2013 or whatever it is that you value \u2013 mostly isn't about\nmaking the right decision in the moment. It's mostly about the decisions that\nyou make leading up to that moment, that prepare you to be able to make the\ndecision that you feel is right.\n\nAs always\u2013 I love reading e-mail from ya'll so if you have a comment or a\nquestion, write in, or leave a comment.\n\nJesus fuck though those people on Reddit are lunatics.\n\n\\- Nat\n\n# Don't lie in interviews\n\nIf your model is \"it's okay to lie if I've been lied to\" then we're all knee\ndeep in bullshit forever and can never escape Transaction Cost Hell.\n\n#### Nat Bennett\n\nApr 17, 2024\n\nSimpler Machines\n\n## 4 comments\n\nSimpler Machines \u00a9 2024.
