Obviously, I was an idiot and had forgotten to press the NumLock\nbutton. D'oh! I toggled it on and typed again. No numbers appeared. I switched\nto another tab, my numbers appeared when I typed them. So I was reasonably\nconfident that my keyboard was working.\n\nI swapped back to the 2FA entry and tried again. Still nothing. Then I tried\ntyping the numbers using the number row on my keyboard. My 2FA code appeared.\n\nWHAT IN THE SAINTED NAME OF ALPHONSE CHAPANIS IS GOING ON?!?!?\n\nDevelopers often use JavaScript to \"improve\" the standard features of HTML.\nFor example, using <input type=\"number\"> has some accessibility concerns and\nusing inputmode=\"numeric\" is great for showing a number key board on mobile,\nbut not much else.\n\nSo a developer wants a reliable way to make sure a user can only type numbers.\nFair enough.\n\nThere are two ways to do this - a right way and a wrong way - using\nKeyboardEvent.\n\nOne way is to listen for the character being sent from the keyboard - known as\nthe key.\n\nThe other is to listen for the button being pressed on the keyboard - known as\nthe code.\n\nA good demo of this is at keyjs.dev - play around with it to see what keyboard\nbuttons your browser can detect.\n\nWhen I press 7 on the top row of my keyboard, the key is 7 and the code is\nDigit7.\n\nBut when I press 7 on my number pad, the key is 7 but the code is Numpad7.\n\nThe JavaScript on the website was rejecting any key code which wasn't a\n\"Digit\"!\n\nPerhaps I am a weirdo for insisting on both having and using my numpad?\nPerhaps developers need to test on something other than MacBooks? Perhaps\nJavaScript was a mistake and the Web would be better without it?\n\nEither way, don't be like that website. Let users type in using whatever keys\nthey like.\n\n## Share this post on...\n\n  * Mastodon\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Reddit\n  * HackerNews\n  * Lobsters\n  * Pocket\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Telegram\n\n## The AlgorithmTM suggests:\n\n  * Should browsers remember 2FA codes?\n\n2021\n\n  * 2FA Best Practice - Disable Autocomplete\n\n2014\n\n  * Firefox might remember old 2FA logins\n\n2023\n\n  * I have Thirty-One 2FA codes\n\n2019\n\n## 3 thoughts on \u201cI can't use my number pad for 2FA codes\u201d\n\n  1. 2024-04-17 12:51\n\n### Timothy Wolodzko says:\n\n@blog Sometimes I think that ability to add dynamic code, like JavaScript, to\nwebsites was a mistake...\n\nReply | Reply on hachyderm.io\n\n  2. 2024-04-17 13:15\n\n### Lewis Dale says:\n\n@Edent Sorry, our app only supports 60% layout mechanical keyboards, it's in\nthe TOS.\n\nReply | Reply on social.lol\n\n  3. 2024-04-17 13:29\n\n### Christopher Kirk-Nielsen says:\n\n@blog I've run into this too some time ago, it's infuriating to say the least!\n\nReply | Reply on front-end.social\n\n  4. ### More comments on Mastodon.\n\n### What are your reckons?
