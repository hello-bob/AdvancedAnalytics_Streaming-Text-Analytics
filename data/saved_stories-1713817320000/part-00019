The work was started\nby his father, Sima Tan, an astrologer to the imperial court, and finished by\nSima Qian in 94 BC. It covers a period of approximately 2000 years right until\nHan emperor Wudi\u2019s reign (141-87 BC) and the author\u2019s subsequent death.\n\nThe story of how a well-respected court official met his gruesome death is of\ninterest because contextualizing his demise within the time period tells us a\ngreat deal about Chinese imperial customs, legality and divinity.\n\nWe must start with the concept of Heaven\u2019s Favour, also called Heaven\u2019s\nMandate1. The idea is that the universe bestows upon a just ruler its favour,\nand that if an emperor is overthrown they must not have been worthy of the\ntitle. Natural disasters such as famine or flood were also seen as signs of an\nemperor being out of favour with divinity, and cause for many a coup.\n\nThus, a ruling emperor had ample motivation to be seen as infallible and\nperfect for any mistake could be seen as the emperor losing favour with\nHeaven. After all, if divinity had blessed you as the Son of Heaven, how could\nyou possibly make a mistake? Surely, it could only be a sign that the blessing\nwas no longer valid, and in the cut-throat court where murder lurked behind\ntreachery, an emperor\u2019s main defense was to eliminate any doubt of his\ninfallibility and go on the offensive which very often meant mass execution of\nentire extended families.\n\nThis was also a period where Confucian ideas were being applied in the court\nand the requirement that a ruler must be attuned to Heaven\u2019s Mandate was\ncentral. According to Confucius (551-479 BC) the emperor had to be of\nexemplary moral standards, for only when the people saw his example would they\nbe shamed into correcting themselves. Confucius preferred this method of\nkeeping the public in order rather than laws and punishment which he believed\nto be ineffective. Though the philosopher also stated the importance of self-\ncorrection after errors, this did not seem to apply to emperors due to the\nelevated status bestowed through Heaven\u2019s Mandate. This contradiction seems to\nbe swept under the carpet throughout early Chinese history.\n\nRivals of the emperor often successfully employed the tactic of making an\nemperor look like he had lost Heaven\u2019s Favour to stage revolts, especially in\ncases where regents presided over the empire while the emperor came of age.\nOne such instance was how the regent Zhao Gao took out a young emperor. Gao\ngave the emperor a gift of a deer while calling it a horse. When the emperor\npointed out that this in fact was not a horse at all but a deer, Gao had his\ncollaborators in court \u201cconfirm\u201d that it in fact was a horse, and that\nsomething must be wrong with His Majesty\u2019s condition. Other collaborators\npointed out how the emperor had recently slurred his words at a liturgy, and\nthat was that. The emperor was soon advised to poison himself to avoid capture\nfrom a phantom army who had sensed him losing Heaven\u2019s Favour. He did just\nthat.\n\nWith that in mind we\u2019ll return to our protagonist, Sima Qian who in 99 BC, 13\nyears before his death, was busy writing a chapter of Shiji while a war raged\non. Emperor Wu\u2019s campaign against the Xiongnu, a tribal confederacy to the\nnorth, was not going too well. His main appointed general was Li Guangli who\nwas also his brother in law. Serving under Li Guangli was another general, Li\nLing. Li Guangli had not anticipated the swiftness of the Xiongnu on the\nnorthern terrains and had limped back to defeat. Of the 100,000 men that\nmarched north under him only 10,000 returned. However, the emperor not wanting\nto blame anyone in his family, blamed Li Ling for the military failure. None\nof the meek government officials wanted to challenge the emperor on this\nflawed take for fear of suggesting Heaven\u2019s Favour had been tampered with, and\nnodded their heads in agreement.\n\nAll except Sima Qian.\n\nLi Ling\u2019s courage and military nous was unquestionable. Where Li Guangli had\nseverely underestimated the complexity of the windswept northern terrains and\nled his forces to a military failure so significant that he was at first\nrefused entry back into Han territory after his retreat. Li Ling on the other\nhand, with just 5,000 infantry had fought for weeks against impossible odds\nuntil there wasn\u2019t an arrow in a quiver left. Though Sima Qian was not a\nfriend of Li Ling, he respected him and sought to \u201cbroaden His Majesty\u2019s\nviews\u201d on the events of the war. Instead, he was accused of trying to\nexonerate Li Ling in order to disparage Li Guangli, and in turn put into\nquestion the emperor\u2019s judgement, for it was the Emperor Wu who had appointed\nLi Guangli and of course, losing a war could easily be seen as losing Heaven\u2019s\nFavour. That at all costs needed to be avoided and thus Sima Qian was\nsentenced to death by suicide. This was hardly a controversial sentence as\nnoted by John Keay2:\n\n> For in the Confucian ideal, officials attracted by the magnetic effect of\n> the emperor\u2019s moral example were supposed to be sufficiently righteous and\n> high-minded to recognize their guilt and penalise themselves. Not to do\n> would be to acknowledge their inadequacy for office in the first place and\n> to cast a slur on the judgement and moral calibre of the emperor, a surefire\n> way to a death yet more painful. Except as a delaying tactic, it was\n> pointless to to plead one\u2019s innocence. Imprisonment pending trail was a\n> euphemism for torture pending confession.\n\nHaving yet to finish the history he had poured his life into, Sima Qian\nsearched desperately for options. There were two other than death. The first\nwas the purchase of a commutation into exile, but lacking the funds, it was an\nunfeasible option. The second was \u201cthe punishment of rottenness\u201d which meant\ncastration and a plunge into the lowest strata of society where nothing but\nhumiliation, derision and contempt lay. A future where he was excommunicated\nfrom society and seen as a scourge upon humanity. Along with Li Ling, the man\nwho he had stood up for, Sima Qian was castrated. Explaining his decision to\nopt for this avenue he wrote3:\n\n> Together we became a sight for all the world to laugh at in scorn. Alas,\n> alas! Matters such as these it is not easy to explain to ordinary people.\n>\n> The reason I have not refused to bear these ills and have continued to live,\n> dwelling in vileness and disgrace without taking my leave, is that I grieve\n> that I have things in my heart which I have not been able to express fully,\n> and I am shamed to think that after I am gone my writings will not be known\n> to posterity.\n>\n> If it may be handed down to men who will appreciate it, and penetrate to the\n> villages and the great cities, then though I should suffer a thousand\n> mutilations, what regret should I have?\n\nSima Qian spent the last thirteen years of his life living in misery while\nfinishing Shiji. The cost of scholarship was his own great personal suffering.\nIt is because of him that today we know about ancient Chinese history\nincluding how the great Han empire came to be, the Confucian ideals that\nmotivated it, the administrative and political aspects that drove it, and much\nmore. True to scholarship, Sima Qian in Shiji, as John Keay notes, \u201chas enough\ninnuendoes to alert posterity to both the emperor\u2019s failings and his own\nlikely bias\u201d. In such times, the truth needed to be read between the lines.\n\nThe word \u201chero\u201d is thrown around a lot.
