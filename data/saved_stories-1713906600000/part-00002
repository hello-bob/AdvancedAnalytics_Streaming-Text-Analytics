Sign up here.\n\nOne of the hard-and-fast laws of economics is that people in rich countries\nwork less than their peers in poorer countries. The rule holds across nations.\nBritish and Japanese people work less on average than those in Mexico and\nIndia. It\u2019s also true across history. Today, the typical American works about\n1,200 fewer hours a year than he did in the late 19th century.\n\nBut something strange happens when we shift our attention from individual\nworkers to households. In the 1880s, when men worked long days and women were\nmostly cut off from the workforce, the typical American married couple\naveraged just over 68 hours of weekly paid labor. In 1965, as men\u2019s workdays\ncontracted and women poured into the workforce, the typical American married\ncouple averaged 67 hours of weekly paid labor\u2014just one hour less. In the early\n2000s, the typical American married couple averaged, you guessed it, almost\nexactly 67 hours of weekly paid labor. In 2020? Still 67 hours.\n\nThese figures come from two papers: \u201cThe Great Transition,\u201d which covers\nlabor-market changes since 1880, by the economists Jeremy Greenwood, Ricardo\nMarto, and Nezih Guner, and \u201cMeasuring Trends in Leisure,\u201d which covers labor-\nmarket changes from 1965 to 2003, by the economists Mark Aguiar and Erik\nHurst. There exists no perfect statistical time series to track work hours for\nmarried couples in the U.S. over the past 140 years. Sources do not always\nagree on precise figures, and over time dual earners may have averaged a\nlittle less or a little more than 67 hours exactly. And, of course, taking an\naverage across many different industries is an extremely blunt measure. But as\nI read and reread these statistics, I was struck by the clear implication that\nmarried couples are working as much as ever.\n\nThat\u2019s astonishing. After all, in the past 140 years, almost everything about\nthe American economy has changed radically. In the 19th century, about half of\nthe U.S. labor force worked in farming. By the 1940s, agriculture\u2019s share of\nemployment fell, and about a third of the country worked in manufacturing.\nToday, both sectors combined barely account for one in 10 American jobs. After\nall this, the average married couple in America still works about 67 hours a\nweek. It is as if some god with an affinity for double-digit prime numbers\ndescended from heaven and decreed that, no matter what seismic changes upended\nthe world from one generation to the next, the average American family must\nlabor for the same number of hours a week, for all of eternity.\n\nSo what explains the 67-Hour Rule? Any answer must begin with the fact that\npaid working hours have increased for women even as they have declined for\nmen, for very different reasons.\n\nIn 1900, just 5 percent of married women held down a paid job. Instead, they\ntypically put in a full 60-hour week at home, where basic upkeep was grueling\nby modern standards. Washing, drying, and ironing one load of laundry took up\nto seven hours, almost a full day\u2019s work. By the mid-20th century, electricity\nhad made possible a set of household technologies\u2014the automatic washer and\ndryer, the refrigerator, the vacuum, and the dishwasher\u2014that combined to\nreduce housework by 30 hours a week. Many women took advantage of those\nefficiencies (and shifting women\u2019s-rights norms) to get a job. From 1880 to\n1965, women\u2019s labor-participation rate skyrocketed from about 5 to more than\n40 percent; by the 1990s, six in 10 women were in the labor force. Meanwhile,\nhousework hours kept falling. From 1965 to 2003, the average married woman\nreduced her \u201cnonmarket\u201d labor\u2014cleaning, cooking, shopping, running errands\u2014by\n13 hours a week and redirected about nine of those hours toward paid work.\n\nAs married women worked less in the home and more outside of it, married men\nunderwent an opposite shift. In 1880, 98 percent of men participated in the\nlabor force, and the typical worker labored 10 hours a day, six days a week.\nGradually, labor-rights protests and union strikes combined to pressure\nemployers to shorten the workweek. In her paper \u201cThe Wage and the Length of\nthe Work Day: From the 1890s to 1991,\u201d the economist Dora Costa writes that\nstate governments in the late 1800s and early 1900s moved to limit work hours\nthrough legislation. During World War I, the War Labor Board established an\neight-hour workday for contractors. In 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt\nsigned the Fair Labor Standards Act, which created a right to overtime pay for\nthose who worked more than 40 hours a week.\n\nMeanwhile, the widespread adoption of new technologies, including tractors and\ncars and, later, computers, made workers more productive in their shorter\nworkdays. Men gradually used their extra time to take on more hours of chores,\nerrands, and child care at home.\n\nThe 67-Hour Rule is, then, a reflection of increased efficiency. Fantastic\nnews, in other words, especially for women. One study of women in rural areas\nwithout electricity in the 1940s found that hand-washing and ironing a\n38-pound laundry load required taking about 6,300 steps around the house, the\nwell, the stove, and back to the house. After nine such loads, a woman would\nhave walked the equivalent of a marathon. The electrification of housework\nreduced the ambulatory burden of that same laundry load by 90 percent.\n\n\u201cIt was a tremendous gain for women to be freed from housework and be able to\njoin the labor force in exchange for a wage,\u201d Marto wrote to me by email.\n\u201cMost people would argue that is a good thing. My wife certainly does!\u201d\nHousehold automation, combined with cultural and economic changes, freed women\nto work as they pleased. At the same time, labor laws shortened the typical\nworkweek and outlawed child labor, while industrial technology increased\nproductivity.\n\nThe economist Jeremy Greenwood is emphatic that the most important theme of\nthe past 140 years of work in America has been the rise of leisure time.\n\u201cPopular books like The Overworked American and More Work for Mother tell\npeople that we\u2019re doing more work than ever and have less leisure time than\never, but this is clearly false,\u201d he told me. In fact, the decline of men\u2019s\npaid work and women\u2019s housework has freed up more leisure hours, even after\naccounting for the increase in child-care time. According to Aguiar and Hurst,\nleisure time increased in the second half of the 20th century for all groups\nthey studied: men and women, singles and married couples.\n\nBut pointing out that men\u2019s workweeks declined while women\u2019s workweeks\nincreased, and that both men and women have more leisure time, doesn\u2019t fully\nexplain why, together, they still labor as long as they used to outside the\nhome more than 100 years ago.\n\nGreenwood told me that, beyond rising efficiency, the 67-Hour Rule may also\nreflect rising costs and rising expectations. Americans are more productive\nthan ever. But buying homes, raising kids, and caring for older family members\nare all more expensive than they used to be. (Prices for housing, medical\ncare, and college have been rising faster than inflation for practically this\nentire century.) The typical home today is also larger than it used to be, and\noutfitted with a suite of technologies\u2014air-conditioning, flatscreen\ntelevisions, dirt-cheap electric lighting\u2014that would have flabbergasted an\n1880s monarch.\n\nSeveral factors determine why a married couple might work more or less in any\ngiven year. Laws shape the normal workweek, employers set schedules, and\nworkers choose jobs based on diverse needs and preferences. Describing the\naverage family is difficult because doing so requires glossing over large\ndifferences: Some households with five children get by with one working\nspouse, while some couples without children work long hours. But overall,\nmillions of families across time have independently concluded that it takes\nabout 67 hours to afford the essential features of a comfortable American\nlife, as they define it. After all, if American families felt that they could\nbe comfortable and happy by working only 15 hours a week, many more of them\nwould do so.\n\nThe consistency of the workweek for married couples might also reflect a\nkeeping-up-with-the-Joneses effect. As workers get raises, some of them could\nchoose to work less. But richer economies also create new categories of\ndesire: movies, amusement parks, electronics, travel, summer camps, Stanley\nwater coolers. If people become envious of their peers\u2019 rising standard of\nliving, they\u2019ll instead choose to continue working at higher wages to buy\nnicer stuff. Thus the hedonic treadmill sustains higher working hours and\nholds the 67-Hour Rule in place.\n\nWhy 67 instead of 60 or 70 or some other number? Again, other sources may not\nreplicate that precise figure. More generally, my guess is as good as yours.\nHere I feel tempted to blame that prime-number god again.\n\nAt any rate, there is something a little disappointing about the possibility\nthat married couples have the same market workweek that they did in 1880. I\u2019m\nnot the first writer to worry about the tragic ironies of the dual-earner\nhousehold. In their book, The Two-Income Trap, Senator Elizabeth Warren and\nher daughter Amelia Warren Tyagi observed that the rise in household income in\nthe late 1990s was driven by the rise in two-income households. Clearly, they\nacknowledged, this was progress. But when a household adds a second earner,\nthey said, it creates additional expenses, especially for child care, which\noften consumes much of the additional income. Thus, many working parents with\nkids feel like they\u2019re running in place rather than pooling their income to\nbuy more comfort.\n\nThe overwork worrywarts are narrowly wrong: Americans really do have more\nleisure time than they used to. But they\u2019re broadly right: Americans ought to\nhave more leisure time than they have, and it is a little scandalous that they\ndon\u2019t.\n\nDerek Thompson is a staff writer at The Atlantic and the author of the Work in\nProgress newsletter.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
