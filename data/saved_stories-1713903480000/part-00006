Hoffmann-La Roche, a global company, at\nits headquarters in Basel, Switzerland. Both are in their fourth and final\nyear of vocational education and training (VET), specializing in informatics\nand communication technology. Coaching them, just like discovering drugs, is a\nrewarding part of my job as a research scientist.\n\nGiulia and Jannick attend vocational schools for one or two days a week.\nBesides studying professional topics, such as how to build a computer network\nor an app, they also acquire life knowledge and skills. These include setting\na household budget, forming a family or partnership and even starting their\nown company.\n\nThe rest of their time is divided between working in my team as software\ndevelopers for drug discovery and attending the company\u2019s dedicated learning\ncentre. Besides writing software that helps to find better drugs, they learn\nadvanced informatics topics, such as cybersecurity and artificial intelligence\n(AI), and acquire crucial skills such as project management and presentation.\nWithin four years, they will become software engineers with industrial work\nexperience.\n\nVocational education is common in German-speaking countries. At around the age\nof 16, teenagers in Switzerland make a choice between general education in an\nupper secondary school and a VET apprenticeship in one of more than 250\nprofessions. Defined and organized by a partnership between the Swiss federal\ngovernment, professional associations and individual regions of Switzerland\ncalled cantons, VET combines on-the-job training with classes in schools. Each\nprofession has its own educational plan, which specifies a nationwide standard\nof skills to be mastered by the apprentices. After finishing the training,\nwhich takes between two and four years depending on the profession, and\npassing a final exam, apprentices receive a diploma that certifies their\nqualification to work or to pursue higher education. Apprentices are paid a\nsalary, which usually starts at 600\u20131,000 Swiss francs (around US$700\u20131,170)\nper month and increases in each year of training.\n\nI stumbled on the apprenticeship culture in Germany while doing my PhD in\ncomputational biology in the 2000s at the German Cancer Research Centre in\nHeidelberg. Until then, I had no real idea about vocational training \u2014 but I\ndid harbour some unfair stereotypes. When I was in secondary school in\nTianjin, a city in northern China with prosperous industries and booming\nbusinesses in the 1990s, vocational training was often seen as an inferior\nchoice to general education. An apprenticeship was stigmatized as the last\nresort for low achievers and problematic children. My stereotypes were\nbanished as soon as I started working with and coaching apprentices in\nHeidelberg. The young people amazed me with their technical expertise and\ndiligent work, and became co-authors of scientific software and publications.\nCoaching them improved my leadership and communication skills, especially\nacross cultures, because neither German nor English, spoken by the\napprentices, was my first language.\n\nNature Spotlight: Switzerland\n\nI moved to Basel to take up an industry position in 2011. It soon became clear\nto me that Swiss people also consider the apprenticeship a respected\neducation. Statistics confirm my impression. Two-thirds of young people in\nSwitzerland opt for an apprenticeship, and one-third of businesses train them.\nDespite the trend in recent years for more students to choose general\neducation over vocational training, high-quality apprenticeship openings\nremain competitive. My company trains around 300 apprentices across 15\nprofessions in the Basel area every year. For 6 informatics and computer-\ntechnology positions, we usually receive more than 100 applications.\n\nGiulia and Jannick are my fourth and fifth trainees. In their third year,\nJannick automated a bioinformatics pipeline (see go.nature.com/49uegts) and\nGiulia developed several software widgets for chemists that help them to\npredict the properties of molecules to be synthesized. Currently, both are\nbuilding a system that helps biologists to visualize and interpret omics data.\nApprentices advance scientific research while honing their skills. Their\neducation is an early-access, paid-for opportunity to gain the combination of\ntheoretical knowledge and practical skills that is normally offered by\nuniversities.\n\nGiulia and Jannick learn much from solving real-world problems such as fixing\na bug. They learn more from making mistakes and getting feedback in a working\nenvironment. After attentive learning followed by good sleep (the working\nhours of underage apprentices are legally limited to a maximum of 9 hours a\nday), they become capable, productive and keen to learn more.\n\nDoing an apprenticeship is not without risks and downsides. I can imagine\nthat, for some 16-year-olds, it must be a formidable task to decide on a\nprofession and to become self-disciplined and professional almost overnight.\nAlso, the quality of education can vary by profession, school and company.\nMoreover, some might consider apprenticeships outdated in an age of automation\nand disruptive technologies such as AI potentially replacing human jobs. A\nGerman friend of mine who learnt book binding had to do another apprenticeship\nand study to get a job as an accountant. Will my apprentices and their peers\nface a similar fate?\n\nAlthough the honest answer to this is \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019, two observations make me\ncautiously optimistic.\n\nFirst, the Swiss apprenticeship system is constantly evolving. The educational\nplans are updated every few years with feedback from all parties. Teachers and\nvocational trainers such as me meet, exchange and receive continuous education\nregularly. Apprentices are incentivized to explore and adopt new technologies\nto enhance their productivity. For instance, apprentices in information and\ncommunications technology can already use tools such as ChatGPT in their final\nexamination, as long as they declare the prompts they have used. A springboard\nfrom classroom to career, apprenticeship prepares one for changes in life.\n\nSecond, the apprenticeship system fosters individual growth. Beyond learning\nfrom experienced colleagues and working under supervision, apprentices are\nencouraged to lead activities \u2014 for instance, building a website for a project\nor advising schoolchildren about their career choices. Besides day-to-day\nwork, my apprentices and I are required to hold a formal discussion every\nsemester. We examine their professional and personal development, give each\nother feedback (from which I learn a lot about myself) and set goals for the\ncoming six months. Apprentices acquire soft skills such as creativity,\nempathy, compassion, resilience and teamwork that will serve them well in\nlife.\n\nI am therefore convinced that an apprenticeship, if done right, is a valuable\neducation. The short feedback circuit between what is needed and what is\ntaught, as well as an education focusing on self-actualization and\ncollaboration, prevent the formation of a chasm that is sometimes apparent\nbetween academia and industry^1. Pondering my own journey to become a research\nscientist in industry, I wish that I had learnt earlier about how to recognize\nand solve real-world problems, the power of knowledge gained from experience,\nthe importance of building trust-based relationships and the fulfilment gained\nby focusing on the growth and development of people around me.\n\nLike most of my previous apprentices, Giulia and Jannick both want to attend\nuniversity when their apprenticeships end. Before that, Jannick is with us for\nanother year (including a six-month company internal exchange in the United\nStates) before undertaking his military or civil service, which is mandatory\nfor men of his age in Switzerland. Giulia will study informatics part-time\nwhile working as a software developer at our company. Both have promising\ncareers ahead: ex-apprentices abound among Swiss political and business\nleaders. Other countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States and\nChina, are also expanding and updating vocational training programmes. The\nworld should perhaps take more notice of the Swiss model.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01102-8\n\nThis article is part of Nature Spotlight: Switzerland, an editorially\nindependent supplement.
