Google's crawlers indexed the resulting\nrobo-responses \u2013 but when users find them, the AI answers are often\ninaccurate.\n\n\"It has happened,\" wrote developer Arian van Putten in a social media post\nover the weekend. \"The number one Google result was an official Pulumi\ndocumentation page that was clearly written by an LLM (it had a disclaimer\nthat it was) and hallucinated an AWS feature that didn't exist. This is the\nbeginning of the end.\"\n\nAs The Register opined in 2022 and reported in January this year, search\nquality has declined because search engines index low-quality AI-generated\ncontent and present it in search results. This remains an ongoing area of\nconcern.\n\nPulumi AI and its online archive of responses, AI Answers, is a case in point.\nGoogle's search crawler indexes the output of Pulumi's AI and presents it to\nsearch users alongside links to human-authored content. Software developers\nhave found some of the resulting AI-authored documentation and code inaccurate\nor even non-functional.\n\nThe problem was noted on March 21, 2024 by developer Pete Nyk\u00e4nen in a GitHub\nIssues post to the Pulumi AI code repository. \"Today I was googling various\ninfrastructure related searches and noticed a worrying trend of Pulumi AI\nanswers getting indexed and ranking high on Google results, regardless of the\nquality of the AI answer itself or if the question involved Pulumi in the\nfirst place. This happened with multiple searches and will probably get even\nworse as the time goes on.\"\n\nOthers have also raised the issue.\n\n### A rising tide of muck\n\nNyk\u00e4nen told The Register in an email that he began noticing Pulumi AI search\nresult issues around the time he posted to GitHub last month.\n\n\"As an engineer, I spend a lot of time searching for answers online and it was\nnot difficult to notice the AI answers rising to the top of the search results\novernight, even for keywords unrelated to Pulumi itself,\" he noted. \"I filed\nthe issue and hoped that Pulumi would rectify the situation (which they\npromised to do) but sadly the issue still persists.\"\n\n\"Documentation, especially infrastructure related, is already often incorrect,\nhard to find, outdated or otherwise missing. While tools like Pulumi AI can\nprovide value to some, filling the internet with unconfirmed, possibly\nhallucinated, answers is actually pretty malicious. And the longer it goes on,\nthe worse it gets.\"\n\nNyk\u00e4nen argued that with AI content already appearing at the top of search\nresults and more companies creating content generation tools, he hopes that\nthose involved in AI consider how their work impacts the integrity of the web.\n\n\"I don't think it's too late for Pulumi either and hopefully they will decide\nto hide their AI generated content from search engine scrapers,\" he suggested.\n\nAaron Friel, an AI engineer at Pulumi, acknowledged Nyk\u00e4nen's concerns,\nresponding the following day that the developer has \"taken steps to remove\nmore than half (almost two thirds) of AI Answers, and we plan to continue to\nensure that these AI answers are complementary to our existing documentation.\"\n\nFriel noted that Pulumi also plans to make sure its site mentions real APIs\nand upstream documentation. Testing generated code is also on the to-do list.\n\n### Hello? Google?\n\nThat was a month ago, and Google hasn't yet gotten the memo. When The Register\ntried the keywords cited by Nyk\u00e4nen on Monday \"aws lightsail xray\" \u2013 Pulumi\nAI's answer was the second search result. And when we tried again on Tuesday,\nit ranked at the top of the page \u2013 above the official AWS documentation.\n\nWe asked Google what it thought of the situation and a company spokesperson\ntold us it \"always aims to surface high quality information, but on some niche\ntopics or unusual queries, there may not be a lot of high quality content\navailable to rank highly in Search.\"\n\nThe search giant also reminded us that it policies mean \"Low value content\nthat\u2019s created at scale to manipulate Search rankings is spam, however it is\nproduced\", and that recent updates to its tech \"reduced low quality,\nunoriginal content on Search by 45 percent, and aim to tackle unhelpful\ncontent that\u2019s designed to rank well in Search.\"\n\nMicrosoft's Bing search engine could be ahead of the game in terms of\nfiltering AI-generated material as it did not have this problem for the same\nquery, though results it produced included a Chat button that launched an AI-\ngenerated response if you took the bait and clicked rather than just hitting\nreturn to submit the query. Brave Search also omitted the Pulumi AI response.\nDuckDuckGo, meanwhile, returned the Pulumi AI result as the fourth item on its\nsearch results page for the query.\n\n  * Open Source world's Bruce Perens emits draft Post-Open Zero Cost License\n  * European Commission starts formal probe of Meta over election misinformation\n  * Politicians call for ban on 'killer robots' and the curbing of AI weapons\n  * OpenAI slapped with GDPR complaint: How do you correct your work?\n\nAnother GitHub Issue post on Monday, referring to van Putten's complaint, has\nasked for the removal of Pulumi AI's answer about AWS EBS direct APIs \u2013 which\nPulumi evidently does not support.\n\nSeveral AI hallucinations flagged in March have already been dealt with.\n\nIn an email to The Register, Pulumi co-founder and CEO Joe Duffy defended his\nfirm's AI effort \u2013 but allowed that more drastic intervention might be called\nfor if the issue can't be adequately addressed.\n\n\"Pulumi AI has transformed how most of our customers work, enabling them to\nnavigate a sea of hundreds of clouds with the myriad ways you can use all of\ntheir services,\" Duffy explained. \"We processed a 50 percent increase in\nprompts quarter on quarter, which is a testament to how useful our customers\nare finding it to their daily work.\"\n\n### A startup that promises to do better ...\n\nDuffy claimed that Pulumi has tested and improved its code quality over time\nand has seen a double-digit improvement in the success rates for code examples\nquarter over quarter.\n\n\"That said, we know these aren't perfect,\" he conceded. \"Because our AI\nanswers are indexable by Google, they show up in search results. I'll be the\nfirst to admit, I was surprised at how highly Google is ranking these pages,\nsince in general they have no inbound links \u2013 a far cry from how PageRank used\nto work \u2013 and I would have expected it to prefer our older, more mature\ncontent.\"\n\nAsked when Pulumi first realized its AI had issues, Duffy acknowledged Pulumi\nhas been aware its AI isn't perfect since it launched last year, and has\ninvested to improve its quality.\n\n\"We have a new typechecker loop that feeds back into the AI and improves our\nresults,\" he explained. \"We've tweaked it to be better at Python, and we've\ntaught it about our cloud SDKs. All of these have had material increases in\nquality \u2013 and it will just keep getting better from here. Although there's\nbeen some negative sentiment on social media, far and away the feedback we get\ndirectly is that the AI is helpful, especially when just getting started in\nthe cloud \u2013 it truly is daunting to even get started navigating hundreds of\nclouds each with tens of thousands of services.\"\n\nDuffy revealed that Pulumi has already removed 100,000 AI answers and will\ntake down more in future.\n\nDespite the challenges, Duffy expects AI will improve over time. \"We move fast\nand try innovative new ideas regularly \u2013 and sometimes they just don't work\nout the way we intended,\" he admitted. \"If we can\u2019t get to a good place\nquickly, we will absolutely consider delisting all of them and building back\nup more slowly.\"\n\nDuffy added that Pulumi's AI Answers clearly state that they're the product of\nAI. \"Despite the hallucinations, we regularly hear 'Even if imperfect, we\nprefer to have something 80 percent correct, [rather] than nothing at all'.\" \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * ChatGPT\n  * Devops\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * ChatGPT\n  * Devops\n  * Search\n  * Software\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AdBlock Plus\n  * API\n  * App\n  * Application Delivery Controller\n  * Audacity\n  * Bing\n  * Cloud native\n  * Confluence\n  * Database\n  * FinOps\n  * FOSDEM\n  * FOSS\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * Grab\n  * Graphics Interchange Format\n  * IDE\n  * Jenkins\n  * Legacy Technology\n  * LibreOffice\n  * Machine Learning\n  * Map\n  * MCubed\n  * Microsoft 365\n  * Microsoft Office\n  * Microsoft Teams\n  * Mobile Device Management\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NLP\n  * OpenOffice\n  * Programming Language\n  * QR code\n  * Retro computing\n  * Search Engine\n  * Software bug\n  * Software License\n  * Star Wars\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n  * Text Editor\n  * User interface\n  * Visual Studio\n  * Visual Studio Code\n  * WebAssembly\n  * Web Browser\n  * WordPress\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Development\n  * Large Language Model\n  * OpenAI\n  * Self-driving Car\n\n#### More about\n\n24 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * ChatGPT\n  * Devops\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * AI\n  * ChatGPT\n  * Devops\n  * Search\n  * Software\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AdBlock Plus\n  * API\n  * App\n  * Application Delivery Controller\n  * Audacity\n  * Bing\n  * Cloud native\n  * Confluence\n  * Database\n  * FinOps\n  * FOSDEM\n  * FOSS\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * GPT-3\n  * GPT-4\n  * Grab\n  * Graphics Interchange Format\n  * IDE\n  * Jenkins\n  * Legacy Technology\n  * LibreOffice\n  * Machine Learning\n  * Map\n  * MCubed\n  * Microsoft 365\n  * Microsoft Office\n  * Microsoft Teams\n  * Mobile Device Management\n  * Neural Networks\n  * NLP\n  * OpenOffice\n  * Programming Language\n  * QR code\n  * Retro computing\n  * Search Engine\n  * Software bug\n  * Software License\n  * Star Wars\n  * Tensor Processing Unit\n  * Text Editor\n  * User interface\n  * Visual Studio\n  * Visual Studio Code\n  * WebAssembly\n  * Web Browser\n  * WordPress\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Development\n  * Large Language Model\n  * OpenAI\n  * Self-driving Car\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Law prof predicts generative AI will die at the hands of watchdogs\n\nVideo Big tech backlash and animus against the machines will invite stifling\nred tape\n\nAI + ML7 days | 21\n\n#### With Run:ai acquisition, Nvidia aims to manage your AI kubes\n\nNow Jensen has a control plane to play with his army of NIMs\n\nAI + ML7 days |\n\n#### AI spam is winning the battle against search engine quality\n\ninterview 'Not all AI content is spam, but I think right now all spam is AI\ncontent'\n\nAI + ML18 days | 39\n\n#### Java thriving after 30 years\n\nWhy OpenJDK is as important as ever in the big picture of IT\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### IBM to acquire Hashi for $6.4B, hopes it will boost software biz and Red\nHat\n\nInvestors want to know what Big Blue is smoking after growth disappoints\n\nOff-Prem6 days | 22\n\n#### What's up with AI lately?
