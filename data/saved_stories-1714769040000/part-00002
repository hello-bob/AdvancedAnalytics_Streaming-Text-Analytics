The move was\ndesigned to permit resets when users didn\u2019t have access to the email address\nused to establish the account. In January, GitLab disclosed that the feature\nallowed attackers to send reset emails to accounts they controlled and from\nthere click on the embedded link and take over the account.\n\nWhile exploits require no user interaction, hijackings work only against\naccounts that aren\u2019t configured to use multifactor authentication. Even with\nMFA, accounts remained vulnerable to password resets, but the attackers\nultimately are unable to access the account, allowing the rightful owner to\nchange the reset password. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-7028,\ncarries a severity rating of 10 out of 10.\n\nOn Wednesday, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said it\nis aware of \u201cevidence of active exploitation\u201d and added the vulnerability to\nits list of known exploited vulnerabilities. CISA provided no details about\nthe in-the-wild attacks. A GitLab representative declined to provide specifics\nabout the active exploitation of the vulnerability.\n\n### Further Reading\n\n~18,000 organizations downloaded backdoor planted by Cozy Bear hackers\n\nThe vulnerability, classified as an improper access control flaw, could pose a\ngrave threat. GitLab software typically has access to multiple development\nenvironments belonging to users. With the ability to access them and\nsurreptitiously introduce changes, attackers could sabotage projects or plant\nbackdoors that could infect anyone using software built in the compromised\nenvironment. An example of a similar supply chain attack is the one that hit\nSolarWinds in 2020 and pushed malware to more than 18,000 of its customers,\n100 of whom received follow-on hacks. Other recent examples of supply chain\nattacks are here, here, and here.\n\nThese sorts of attacks are powerful. By hacking a single, carefully selected\ntarget, attackers gain the means to infect thousands of downstream users,\noften without requiring them to take any action at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Internet scans performed by security organization Shadowserver,\nmore than 2,100 IP addresses showed they were hosting one or more vulnerable\nGitLab instances.\n\nEnlarge\n\nShadowserver\n\nThe biggest concentration of IP addresses was in India, followed by the US,\nIndonesia, Algeria, and Thailand.\n\nEnlarge\n\nShadowserver\n\nThe number of IP addresses showing vulnerable instances has fallen over time.\nShadowserver shows that there were more than 5,300 addresses on January 22,\none week after GitLab issued the patch.\n\nEnlarge\n\nShadowserver\n\nThe vulnerability is classed as an improper access control flaw.\n\nCISA has ordered all civilian federal agencies that have yet to patch the\nvulnerability to do so immediately. The agency made no mention of MFA, but any\nGitLab users who haven\u2019t already done so should enable it, ideally with a form\nthat complies with the FIDO industry standard.\n\nGitLab users should also remember that patching does nothing to secure systems\nthat have already been breached through exploits. GitLab has published\nincident response guidance here.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n41\n\nDan Goodin Dan Goodin is Senior Security Editor at Ars Technica, where he\noversees coverage of malware, computer espionage, botnets, hardware hacking,\nencryption, and passwords.

But someone had to code that to\nhappen that way and why would you even prototype that?\n\nMay 2, 2024 at 10:45 pm\n\n### Channel Ars Technica\n\n#### Unsolved Mysteries Of Quantum Leap With Donald P.
