Some of his last work could yield new\ncancer treatments.\n\nSome of the final work of a late School of Medicine scientist has opened the\ndoor for life-saving new treatments for solid cancer tumors, including breast\ncancer, lung cancer and melanoma.\n\nPrior to his sudden death in 2016, John Herr, PhD, had been collaborating with\nUVA Cancer Center\u2019s Craig L. Slingluff Jr., MD, to investigate the possibility\nthat a discovery from Herr\u2019s lab could help treat cancer.\n\nEight years of research has borne that idea out: Herr\u2019s research into the\nSAS1B protein could lead to \u201cbroad and profound\u201d new treatments for multiple\ncancers, many of which are very difficult to treat, Slingluff reports in a new\nscientific paper in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer. Herr is listed as\na senior author on the paper.\n\n\u201cJohn was very excited about this protein SAS1B to be a valuable new target on\nhuman cancers, and I am delighted that our findings together further support\nhis hope to make such a difference,\u201d said Slingluff, a surgical oncologist and\ntranslational immunologist at UVA Health and the UVA School of Medicine. \u201cThe\nwork we published included work done by Dr. Herr and his team over a period of\nyears, as well as our subsequent work together; so, I am glad that the journal\nagreed with our request to include John as a senior author.\u201d\n\n## Promising New Cancer Target\n\nHerr\u2019s lab was not originally focused on cancer -- he was the head of UVA\u2019s\nCenter for Research in Contraceptive and Reproductive Health. In that role, he\ndeveloped the first home fertility test for men, SpermCheck, which is\navailable in pharmacies across the country. But his discoveries about the\nSAS1B protein found in developing eggs in women could pave the way for new\ncancer immunotherapies.\n\nWhile SAS1B is found inside female reproductive cells called oocytes, it is\nalso found on the surface of many different solid cancer cells, Slingluff\u2019s\nnew research verifies. Importantly, it did not appear on the surface of any of\nthe other normal cells Slingluff\u2019s laboratory tested. That suggests that\ndoctors may be able to develop use antibody-based immunotherapy \u2013 such as\nantibody-drug conjugates or CAR T-cell therapy, a strength of UVA Health \u2013 to\nattack the cancer cells while sparing healthy tissue.\n\n\u201cSelectively targeting SAS1B has the potential to have broad and profound\nimpact on the treatment, and therefore reduction in mortality, of multiple\nmalignancies,\u201d Slingluff and his colleagues write in their new paper.\n\nWhile much more work needs to be done, the new findings are promising. If the\napproach is successful, it could be a big step forward in cancer care. Many\nsolid-organ cancers are extremely difficult to treat, and patients often have\nfew good treatment options, Slingluff notes.\n\n\u201cImmune therapy is revolutionizing treatment of human cancers,\u201d Slingluff\nsaid. \u201cBut some cancers have been particularly resistant to immune therapy\nbecause of the lack of good targets on those cancers. We hope that this work\nthat John Herr started will bring new hope to patients with those cancers.\u201d\n\nFinding new ways to improve cancer care is a foundational mission of UVA\nCancer Center, one of only 56 cancer centers to receive \u201ccomprehensive\u201d\ndesignation from the National Cancer Institute. The designation honors elite\ncancer centers with the most outstanding cancer care and research programs in\nthe country.\n\nAdvancing the field of immunotherapy is also a key mission of UVA\u2019s\nforthcoming Paul and Diane Manning Institute of Biotechnology. Now under\nconstruction at Fontaine Research Park, the institute is poised to accelerate\nthe development of new treatments and cures for a wide variety of diseases,\nultimately transforming how healthcare is delivered across Virginia and\nbeyond.\n\n## About the Research\n\nSlingluff\u2019s collaborators on the new paper consisted of Arabinda Mandal,\nJagathpala Shetty, Christine A. Tran, Walter C. Olson, Mriganka Mandal, Bhupal\nBan, Eusebio S. Pires, Sara J. Adair and Todd W. Bauer. Herr is also credited\non the paper \u2013 he and Slingluff are listed as joint senior authors.\n\nThe research was supported by the Cancer Research Institute; the Grand\nChallenges Exploration Program from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; the\nWallace H. Coulter Translation Research Partnership Endowment; the Virginia\nCenter for Innovative Technology; the National Cancer Institute, grants P30\nCA044579 and T32 CA163177; and by the National Institutes of Health\u2019s National\nHeart, Lung and Blood Institute, grant T32 HL007849.\n\nUVA has filed patent applications on the use of SAS1B as a cancer drug and\ndiagnostic target. Slingluff has received research support from Celldex,\nGlaxo-Smith Kline, Merck, 3M and Theraclion, and he receives licensing fees\nthrough the UVA Licensing and Ventures Group for patents for peptides used in\ncancer vaccines. A full list of the authors\u2019 disclosures is included in the\npaper.\n\nTo keep up with the latest medical research news from UVA, subscribe to the\nMaking of Medicine blog.\n\nCategories: All Releases\n\nMedia Contact\n\nJoshua Barney\n\nDeputy Public Information Officer\n\nEmail | jdb9a@virginia.edu\n\nPhone | 434.906.8864\n\n## Latest News\n\nMay 7, 2024 Howard Hanna/Roy Wheeler Realty to Donate $10,000 to UVA Health\nChildren\u2019s\n\nMay 6, 2024 Late Scientist\u2019s Last Works Could Spur New Cancer Treatments\n\nMay 2, 2024 Adding AI to Artificial Pancreas Enhances Efficiency, Study Finds\n\nNewsroom\n\nLatest news releases, videos and more\n\nAll materials on our site are copyrighted. \u00a9 2024 by the Rector and Visitors\nof the University of Virginia\n\n", "frontpage": false}
