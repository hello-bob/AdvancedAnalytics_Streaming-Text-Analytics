This paper aims to address this question. Our systematic\n> investigation across a wide spectrum of models reveals that a special type\n> of attention heads are largely responsible for retrieving information, which\n> we dub retrieval heads. We identify intriguing properties of retrieval\n> heads:(1) universal: all the explored models with long-context capability\n> have a set of retrieval heads; (2) sparse: only a small portion (less than\n> 5\\%) of the attention heads are retrieval. (3) intrinsic: retrieval heads\n> already exist in models pretrained with short context. When extending the\n> context length by continual pretraining, it is still the same set of heads\n> that perform information retrieval. (4) dynamically activated: take Llama-2\n> 7B for example, 12 retrieval heads always attend to the required information\n> no matter how the context is changed. The rest of the retrieval heads are\n> activated in different contexts. (5) causal: completely pruning retrieval\n> heads leads to failure in retrieving relevant information and results in\n> hallucination, while pruning random non-retrieval heads does not affect the\n> model's retrieval ability. We further show that retrieval heads strongly\n> influence chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, where the model needs to\n> frequently refer back the question and previously-generated context.\n> Conversely, tasks where the model directly generates the answer using its\n> intrinsic knowledge are less impacted by masking out retrieval heads. These\n> observations collectively explain which internal part of the model seeks\n> information from the input tokens. We believe our insights will foster\n> future research on reducing hallucination, improving reasoning, and\n> compressing the KV cache.\n\nComments:| Preprint  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.15574 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.15574v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Yao Fu [view email] [v1] Wed, 24 Apr 2024 00:24:03 UTC (1,164 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Retrieval Head Mechanistically Explains Long-\nContext Factuality, by Wenhao Wu and 3 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
