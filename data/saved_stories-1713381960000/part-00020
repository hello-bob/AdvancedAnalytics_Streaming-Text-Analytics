Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n# Are kale, broccoli and Brussels sprouts really all the same plant?\n\nNews\n\nBy Marlowe Starling\n\npublished March 24, 2024\n\nHave you ever heard of the plant Brassica oleracea?\n\nThese vegetables \u2014 broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, kale, kohlrabi,\ncauliflower \u2014 are all varieties grown from the plant Brassica oleracea. (Image\ncredit: stockcreations via Shutterstock)\n\nKale, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, collard greens and\nkohlrabi have unique nutritional values, and we think of them as distinct\nvegetables. Yet, they all share the same species name. Could they all really\ncome from the same plant?\n\nThe short answer is yes, and humans are responsible for the differences among\nthese veggies.\n\n\"It is all one plant, Brassica oleracea, that humans have selected over\nmultiple generations to have these varying vegetables that we all enjoy\neating,\" Makenzie Mabry, an evolutionary biologist at the Florida Museum of\nNatural History, told Live Science.\n\nChris Pires, an evolutionary biologist who studies crop science at Colorado\nState University, calls these veggies \"the dogs of the plant world.\" All pet\ndogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are the same species, domesticated from wolves\n(Canis lupus), and they come in different varieties, or breeds. Similarly,\nbroccoli, cauliflower, kale and the other aforementioned vegetables were also\ndomesticated from the same species, B. oleracea.\n\nRelated: Where did watermelons come from?\n\nThrough artificial selection, the plant Brassica oleracea has been primed to\nproduce many types of vegetables. (Image credit: udaix via Shutterstock)\n\nOf course, many crops were cultivated for specific traits too, such as\nheirloom tomatoes. But unlike those crops, which are bred for different\ncolors, tastes and sizes, Brassica varieties are bred from the plant's\ndifferent physical parts.\n\n\"We domesticated all of the plant parts,\" Pires noted. \"The stem, the\ninflorescence [flower cluster], the leaf, the underground parts.\"\n\n## Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nThat domestication resulted in a wide range of nutritional diversity, too. As\neach variety adapted to different environments, it produced different amounts\nof antioxidants and bitter compounds, Alex McAlvay, an ethnobotanist at the\nNew York Botanical Garden, told Live Science. Even the same vegetable can have\ndifferent nutritional values depending on whether, and how, it's cooked. For\nexample, \"people have bred Brussels sprouts to be creamier, less bitter, more\nflavorful,\" Pires said.\n\nAnd each veggie has had its bout of fame. In the U.S., kale only became\npopular for its so-called superfood properties in the past few decades, and in\nearly 2024, The New York Times published a story about cabbage \"having a\nmoment.\"\n\nEven beyond the seven main vegetables produced from B. oleracea, there are two\nto three dozen varieties that are specific to various regions of the world\nbecause different groups of people domesticated those plants locally. In the\nAmerican South, for example, collards were brought over by European colonists\nand eventually became a staple of Southern cuisine. And the plant continues to\ndevelop in modern research labs; Broccolini, a cross between broccoli and\nChinese broccoli (also known as Chinese kale), was introduced in 1993.\n\nScientists are still deciphering how and why humans artificially selected\ncertain traits from different parts of B. oleracea. Those origins date back\nthousands of years, when our ancestors cultivated different parts of the plant\n\u2014 in some cases, by accident.\n\n\"They were weeds before they were crops,\" McAlvay said. As some societies\ncultivated the weeds with less-bitter leaves or more tender shoots, for\nexample, those traits evolved into the crops farmers now grow commercially.\n\nOne reason it's difficult to trace that ancestry is because the climate and\nenvironment 2,000 years ago were vastly different than they are today, Pires\nnoted. He and Mabry worked on a study in which they attempted to trace those\nlineages. They found evidence that Brassica cretica, a flowering Mediterranean\nplant, is the closest living relative of B. oleracea. Despite their progress,\nthe picture remains incomplete.\n\n\"How do you figure out the origins of something where you don't even know what\nthe ancestor looks like?\" Pires said.\n\nOur current understanding of the Brassica family tree would crumble in an\ninstant if another ancestral variety were discovered, for example, or if\narchaeologists sequenced the ancient DNA of a fossilized relative, Pires said.\nOur evolutionary understanding of the species is constantly changing.\n\nRELATED MYSTERIES\n\n\u2014Why are bananas berries but strawberries aren't?\n\n\u2014Can carrots give you night vision?\n\n\u2014Why do some fruits and vegetables conduct electricity?\n\nAnother reason for the mystery is the way crops evolve. Once humans cultivate\nplants, they can later become feral if abandoned, Mabry said. Crops can also\nturn feral if they hybridize with nearby wild varieties through cross-\npollination. Wild plants, by contrast, have never been cultivated. In this\nsense, B. oleracea has become an important research model for scientists'\nunderstanding of hybridization and larger evolutionary processes.\n\nThe coolest thing about this plant? \"Everyone grows these in their backyard,\"\nMabry said, noting that it's a go-to beginner crop for home gardeners. \"I\nthink we have a real close connection to this plant as a society.\"\n\nMarlowe Starling\n\nLive Science Contributor\n\nMarlowe Starling is a freelance environmental journalist who reports on\nclimate, conservation, water, wildlife and culture.
