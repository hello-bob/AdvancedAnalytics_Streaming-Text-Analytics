Cohen, James\nG. March, and Johan P. Olsen.^[1]\n\nOrganized anarchies are organizations, or decision situations (also known as\nchoice opportunities), characterized by problematic preferences, unclear\ntechnology, and fluid participation.^[1] While some organizations (such as\npublic, educational, and illegitimate organizations) are more frequently\ncharacterized by these traits of organized anarchy, the traits can be\npartially descriptive of any organization, part of the time.^[1]^[3]\n\nWithin this context, of an organized anarchy view of organizational decision\nmaking, the garbage can model symbolizes the choice-opportunity/decision-\nsituation (for example: a meeting where ideas are discussed and decided on) as\na \"garbage can\" that participants are chaotically dumping problems and\nsolutions into, as they are being generated. The \"garbage can\" term's\nsignificance is best understood by considering the manner in which items in a\ntrash can are organized, which is a messy, chaotic mix. The model portrays\nproblems, solutions, and participants/decision-makers as three independent\n\"streams\" that are each generated separately, and flow disconnected from each\nother. These three streams only meet when the fourth stream of choice\nopportunity arises, as a garbage can, for the streams to flow into. The mix of\ngarbage (streams) in a single can (choice opportunity) depends on the mix of\ncans available, on the labels attached to each can, and on what garbage is\ncurrently being generated. The mix of garbage in a single can also depend on\nthe speed at which the garbage is collected and removed from the scene, for\nexample, how long before problems, solutions, and/or participants move on to\nother choice opportunities, or, depending on how long the current choice\nopportunity remains available.^[1] This anarchic view of decision making\ncontrasts with traditional decision theory.\n\n## Organized anarchy[edit]\n\nOrganized anarchies can be characterized by a sense of chaos and dynamism.\nProblems and solutions are loosely coupled. Proposed solutions change during\nbargaining. All participants involved do not get the chance to fully\nparticipate, and have limitations on their time and energy. Many things happen\nat once, all competing with each other for attention.^[2] Amongst the\nconfusion, participants try to make sense of their role in the\norganization.^[2]\n\n### General properties[edit]\n\nThe behavioral theory of organized anarchy views organizations, and/or\ndecision-situations/choice-opportunities, as generally characterized by the\nthree properties of problematic preferences, unclear technology, and fluid\nparticipation (detailed below).^[2] These properties of organized anarchy are\ncharacteristic of any organization in part, part of the time.^[1]\n\n#### Problematic preferences[edit]\n\nThe organization has no clear preference or guidelines.^[1] It operates on the\nbasis of a variety of inconsistent and ill-defined preferences, goals, and\nidentities.^[2] The organization can be described more accurately as a loose\ncollection of ideas, rather than as a coherent structure. Organizations\ndiscover their preferences through actions, more than actions are taken on the\nbasis of preferences.^[1] It is unclear which problems matter, and which do\nnot.^[2]\n\n#### Unclear technology[edit]\n\nThe organization's processes are not understood by the organization's own\nmembers. The organization operates based on trial and error procedures,\nlearning from accidents of past experiences, and pragmatic inventions of\nnecessity.^[1] It is not clear what the consequences are for proposed\nsolutions, or how to solve problems with solutions that lack evidence.^[2]\n\n#### Fluid participation[edit]\n\nParticipants vary in how much time and effort they commit to different\ndomains. Participant involvement also varies, depending on the time.\nConsequently, the boundaries of the organization are continuously uncertain\nand changing. Audiences and decision makers for any type of choice change\nsuddenly and unpredictably.^[1]\n\n### Meaning making[edit]\n\nOrganizations can be viewed as vehicles for solving problems, or structures\nwhere conflict is resolved through bargaining. However, organizations also\nprovide procedures through which participants gain an understanding of what\nthey are doing and what they have done.^[1] Organizations, especially\norganized anarchies, may have difficulty creating their collective platform\nand identity.^[2] In situations of ambiguity, decision making moves away from\nideas of reality, causality, and intentionality, to thoughts of meaning.\nTherefore, decisions become seen as vehicles for constructing meaningful\ninterpretations of fundamentally confusing worlds, instead of outcomes\nproduced by comprehensible environments.^[2] As the complexity of decision\nsituations increase so that they more closely resemble reality, they become\nmeaning generators instead of consequence generators.\n\n> Organized anarchies need structures and processes that symbolically\n> reinforce their espoused values, that provide opportunities for individuals\n> to assert and confirm their status, and that allow people to understand to\n> which of many competing claims on their attention they should respond. They\n> require a means through which irrelevant problems and participants can be\n> encouraged to seek alternative ways of expressing themselves so that\n> decision-makers can do their jobs. They should also be able to \"keep people\n> busy, occasionally entertain them, give them a variety of experiences, keep\n> them off the streets, provide pretexts of storytelling, and allow\n> socializing\" (Weick's The Social Psychology of Organizing, p. 264).\n\nBirnbaum, Robert (1989). \"The Latent Organizational Functions of the Academic\nSenate: Why Senates Do Not Work But Will Not Go Away\". The Journal of Higher\nEducation. Vol. 60, No. 4. p. 439\n\nHence, we understand organized anarchies as meaning makers that we need within\norganizations so that we can feel like we have reasons and identities for\nwhich to be present at the organization and to address many types of concerns,\nsuch as in meetings, where the issues may or may not be relevant to the\nexisting topic of discussion.^[2] Within this perspective, an organization is\na collection of choices seeking problems, issues and feelings seeking decision\nsituations where they can be raised, solutions seeking issues to which they\nmay be able to solve, and decision makers seeking out work.^[1]\n\n## The Garbage Can Model[edit]\n\nWhereas the theory of organized anarchy provided a larger view to describe how\norganizations and decision situations function, the garbage can model focuses\nin on how decisions get made within these organized anarchies.^[2]^[1] The\nmodel details what elements are involved in the decision-making process, how\nthe outcomes are generated, and who/what is able to access this interaction.\n\n### Decision streams[edit]\n\nThe garbage can model views decisions as outcomes of four independent streams\n(detailed below) within organizations. Prior to the garbage can model, the\ndecision process was imagined very differently, as visually displayed, based\non references from the foundational literature, in the figures below.^[1]\n\n\"Although it may be convenient to imagine that choice opportunities lead first\nto the generation of decision alternatives, then to an examination of their\nconsequences, then to an evaluation of those consequences in terms of\nobjectives, and finally to a decision, this type of model is often a poor\ndescription of what actually happens.\"^[1] Cohen, M. D., March, J. G., &\nOlsen, J. P. (1972). A garbage can model of organizational choice.\nAdministrative Science Quarterly. 17(1) p. 3\"In the garbage can model, on the\nother hand, a decision is an outcome or interpretation of several relatively\nindependent streams within an organization.\"^[1] Cohen, M. D., March, J. G., &\nOlsen, J. P. (1972). A garbage can model of organizational choice.\nAdministrative Science Quarterly. 17(1) p. 3-4\n\n#### Problems[edit]\n\nProblems arise from people both inside and outside of the organization, and\nfor many different reasons, all consuming attention. Examples may include\nfamily, career, distribution of status and money, or even current events in\nthe media.^[1] These problems do not need to be real, or actually important,\nbut only to be perceived as such by the decision makers.^[2]\n\n#### Solutions[edit]\n\nSolutions are an individual's or a collective's product. Examples may include\nideas, bills, programs, and operating procedures.^[2] None of the solutions\nneed to pertain to an existing problem. Instead, participants use the\nsolutions generated to actively seek out problems that the solutions may be\nable to solve.^[1]\n\n#### Participants[edit]\n\nParticipants have other demands on their time, and actively arrive to, and\nleave from, the decision-making process. They may also have different\npreferences for different solutions.^[1]\n\n#### Choice opportunities[edit]\n\nChoice opportunities give the organizations chances to act in ways that can be\ncalled decisions. These opportunities occur regularly, and organizations are\nable to determine moments for choice. Examples may include the signing of\ncontracts, hiring and firing employees, spending money, and assigning\ntasks.^[1]^[2]\n\nThe first three streams of problems, solutions, and participants, flow into\nthe fourth stream of choice opportunities, and mix based on chance, timing,\nand who happens to be present.^[2]\n\n### The decision arena[edit]\n\nWhile the first three streams of problems, solutions, and participants, meet\nin the stream of choice opportunity (for example, a choice to hire a new\nemployee), the decision/choice arena is the larger domain where all four of\nthese streams meet.^[2]^[1] This arena can be the type of organization\n(government, school, university) or the greater setting in which this\ninteraction is occurring. For example, a board or committee may be a choice\narena, while the committee's annual elections may be a choice opportunity.\nChoice opportunities may also move between different choice arenas, such as a\ndecision being passed between committees, or departments.^[2]\n\n### Decision outcomes[edit]\n\nThe outcomes of how the four streams mix in a choice arena can vary. Sometimes\ndecisions are made. Other times no decisions are made. Still other times,\ndecisions are made, but do not address the problem that they were meant to\nsolve.^[2]^[1]\n\n#### Resolution[edit]\n\nResolution occurs when the choices taken resolve the problem that was being\naddressed. This success occurs when problems arise in choice opportunities,\nand the decision makers present have the energy/ability to properly address\nthe problems' demands.^[1]^[2]\n\n#### Oversight[edit]\n\nOversight occurs when a decision is taken before the problem reaches it. This\nhappens when choice opportunities arrive and no problems are attached to them.\nThis may be due to problems being attached to other choice arenas at the\nmoment. If there is sufficient energy available to make a choice quickly,\nparticipants will make the choice and move on before the relevant problem\narrives.^[1]^[2]\n\n#### Flight[edit]\n\nFlight occurs when a decision is taken after the problem goes away. This\nhappens when problems are attached to choice opportunities for a period of\ntime and exceed the energy of their respective decision makers to stay focused\non the problem. The original problem may then move to another choice arena.\nExamples are tabling, or sending decisions to subcommittees, where the\nproblems may not get attached to solutions.^[2]^[1]\n\n### Early implications[edit]\n\nThe Fortran model simulations, used in the original paper, found that, most\noften, decisions are not made to resolve problems.^[1] Decision-making\nprocesses were found to be very sensitive to variations in energy and\ntime.^[1] Decision makers and problems were also found to seek each other out,\nand continue to find each other.^[1]\n\nThree key aspects of the efficiency of the decision process are problem\nactivity, problem latency, and decision time.^[1] Problem activity is the\namount of time unresolved problems are actively attached to choice situations.\nThis is a rough measure of the potential for decision conflict in an\norganization.^[1] Problem latency is the amount of time problems spend\nactivated but not linked to choices.^[1] Decision time is the persistence of\nchoices.^[1] Good organizational structures would be assumed to keep problem\nactivity and problem latency low by quickly solving problems with choices.\nNotably, this result was not observed in the garbage can model.^[1]\n\nThe model's processes are very interactive, and some phenomena are dependent\non specific combinations of other structures at play. Important problems were\nfound more likely to be solved than unimportant ones, and important choices\nwere less likely to solve problems than unimportant ones.^[1]\n\n## Model constraints[edit]\n\nAccess structures and deadlines provide limitations on what can enter into the\ngarbage can model's processes.^[1]^[2]\n\n### Access Structure[edit]\n\nDemocratic structures allow everyone to participate, but can also complicate\nthe decision-making process.\n\nAccess structures are the social boundaries that influence which persons,\nproblems, and solutions are allowed access to the choice arena.^[2]\n\n#### Unrestricted/democratic access[edit]\n\nThe loosest access structure, unrestricted/democratic access allows all\nproblems, solutions, and people to enter. Any active problem has access to any\nactive choice.^[1] This creates more energy, but also permits problems,\nsolutions, and participants to interfere with each other. Conflict and time\ndevoted to problems (anarchy) are increased.^[2] An example could be an open\nforum, town hall, or general body meeting.\n\n#### Hierarchical access[edit]\n\nHierarchical structures, such as this chairpersons meeting, limit access to\nimportant actors.\n\nHierarchical access gives priority entry to important actors, problems, and\nsolutions. Both choices and problems are arranged in a hierarchy so that\nimportant problems (having low numbers) have access to many choices, and\n\nimportant choices (also having low numbers) are accessible to only important\n\nproblems.^[1] An example could be making big decisions in an executive\n\nmeeting/committee, while small decisions are left for the general\npopulation.^[2]\n\nSpecialized access allows experts, such as these climate scientists, to\naddress issues that fit their expertise.\n\n#### Specialized access[edit]\n\nSpecialized access happens when only special problems and solutions can gain\nentry to certain meetings. Specific specialists have access to specific\nchoices that fit their expertise.^[2] Each problem has access to only one\nchoice and each choice is accessible to only two problems.^[1] Hence, choices\nspecialize in the types of problems that can be connected to them.^[1] An\nexample could be computer specialists in a technology committee addressing\ntechnical issues.\n\n### Deadlines[edit]\n\nDeadlines characterize temporal boundaries, the timing of decision arenas and\nwhat flows access them.^[2] Constraints include arrival times of problems\n(seasonal or weather issues, such as a heat wave, or a blizzard), solutions\n(time delayed, for example by 1 or 5 year plans), participants (determined by\nthe timing of business days, school semesters, etc.), and choice opportunities\n(for example, meetings based on budget cycles, or student admissions).\n\nDecisions arise from the constraints of access structures and deadlines\ninteracting with the time-dependent flows of problems, solutions, and\nparticipants.^[2]\n\n## Origins of the garbage can model[edit]\n\nWhile still a doctoral student at the University of Bergen in Norway, Johan P.\nOlsen came to the University of California, Irvine as a visiting scholar from\n1968 to 1969. At that time, James G. March was both the Dean of the School of\nSocial Sciences (1964\u20131969), and a professor of psychology and sociology at\nthe University of California, Irvine (1964\u20131970). Coinciding with the time of\nOlsen's visit, and March's last year serving as a dean, Michael D. Cohen was a\ndoctoral student at the University of California, Irvine, and was just\nbeginning his work as a research assistant to March. All three scholars were\npresent at the right time, to witness the university conduct a search process\nto hire a new dean. Ultimately, the search process ended with none of the\npotential candidates being chosen, and the head of the search committee taking\nthe position of dean. During an interview, Olsen describes the chaotic\ndecision-making process that he observed at the university throughout this\nsearch process, and how it served as a foundational experience for the three\nscholars to later collaborate and produce their model.^[4] Olsen explains in\nthis interview how topics previously considered to be important to the\ndecision-making process, such as if the actors were reasonable or rational,\nactually proved to be less important, and were instead trumped by issues such\nas time constraints of the participants involved. An example provided was a\nprofessor being present in one meeting, only to be absent from the following\nmeeting due to professional travel commitments, which can be common for\nuniversity faculty. This prompted Olsen to consider a contextual model of\ndecision making, one that examined the ability to make calculations and\nimplement them, as opposed to models that focused on motivation. Olsen\nobserved decision makers give each other head nods, and other non-verbal\ncommunication, in meetings, and noted the possible communication, or\nmiscommunication this may have entailed. Olsen also highlighted how the search\ncommittee's decision-making process was affected by misinterpreting the\nsilence of the current dean (March) regarding applicants as a sign for lack of\nsupport, when in fact this was not an accurate interpretation of the dean's\npreferences. Olsen, therefore, gained an interest to examine collective, as\nopposed to individual, decision making, and how routines and chance may affect\nthe decision-making process.^[4] All of these factors would lead into the\ndevelopment of the garbage can model.\n\nBy 1972, March, Cohen, and Olsen had all found their way from the University\nof California, Irvine to Stanford University, in the positions of professor,\npost-doctoral fellow, and visiting professor, respectively. That year, they\npublished the seminal paper A Garbage Can Model of Organizational Choice.^[1]\nIn this paper, the authors used version 5 of the programming language Fortran\nto translate their ideas into a computer simulation model of a garbage can\ndecision-making process.^[1]\n\n## Practical applications[edit]\n\nThe model enables choices to be made and problems resolved, even when an\norganization may be plagued by conflict, goal ambiguity, poorly understood\nproblems that come and go, variable environments, and distracted decision\nmakers.^[1] There are many situations where the garbage can process of\ndecision making cannot be eliminated, and in some of these instances, such as\nresearch, or family, the garbage can process should not be eliminated.^[1]\n\nKnowing the characteristics of an organizational anarchy and a garbage can\nmodel can help people to properly identify when and where these phenomena\nexist, and approach them strategically. Understanding how these decision\narenas operate provide tools to successfully manage what could otherwise be a\nproblematic decision-making process.\n\n### Management styles[edit]\n\nOrganized anarchies can be managed, to use the garbage can model to your\nadvantage. Three different management styles can be used, as detailed below.\n\n#### Reformer[edit]\n\nA reformer eliminates the chaotic garbage can elements from decisions.^[2]\nThis creates greater order and control, which centralizes and rationalizes the\norganization.^[2]\n\n#### Enthusiast[edit]\n\nIn contrast to the reformer, the enthusiast tries to discover a new vision of\nthe decision making within garbage can processes.^[2] The enthusiast realizes\nthat the planning is in large part symbolic, and is an excuse for participants\nto interact and generate meaning.^[2] It allows participants to feel a sense\nof belonging, and to learn about identities and views.^[2] Once the enthusiast\nunderstands that the decision arena is more for sense-making and observations,\nthan for making decisions, temporal sorting can be used as a way to organize\nattention. The temporal order of topics presented can suggest what is of more\nconcern for collective discussion. Flows of problems and solutions are viewed\nas a matching market, where energies and connections are mobilized.^[2]\nAssessing who is present, and where time and energy are sufficient, allows the\nenthusiasts to advance their case most effectively. Characteristics of the\ngarbage can model that were seen by others as disadvantages, such as flexible\nimplementation, uncoordinated action, and confusion, are viewed as advantages\nby the enthusiast.^[2]\n\n#### Pragmatist[edit]\n\nThe pragmatist tries to exploit the anarchy inherent in the garbage can\nprocesses to further personal agendas.^[2] Timing can be manipulated to have\nsolutions arrive when attention is low. The meeting can be arranged in an\norder that is personally favorable, where items that are desired to be\ndiscussed are placed at the top of the agenda, and items that need to be\npassed, in which discussion is not desired, are placed at the bottom of the\nagenda, so that the decision can be rushed through when there is not enough\ntime for discussion.^[2] The pragmatist pays attention to fluctuations in\ninterests and participant involvement, so that when certain individuals are\nnot present, it can be easier to advance issues and solutions that may have\notherwise been opposed by different participants.^[2] Initiatives that are\nentangled with other streams can be abandoned, and if an unfavorable topic\narises, the system can be overloaded to protect the pragmatist's\ninterests.^[2] This can be accomplished by bringing up different problems and\nsolutions, which will slow the decision-making process down and make it more\ncomplex.^[2] Other choice opportunities (meetings) can also be proposed to\nlure problems and participants away from choices that are of interest, in the\nprocess gaining time for the pragmatists to address the issues of their\nconcern.^[2]\n\n## Multi-disciplinary impact[edit]\n\nThe garbage can model can be especially helpful in explaining all types of\nmeetings where problems and solutions are fluidly discussed.^[2] The model\nfits well with almost any decentralized social system attempting to address\nissues, and the model is continuously finding its way into new domains.^[1]\nFor example, across a sample of firms involved in hydrocarbon megaprojects,\nresearchers found that problems given the most attention are different from\nthose responsible for budget overruns, and that the attribution of reasons for\nthese overruns differ between project owners and supply chain firms.^[5] These\ninconsistencies are addressed by the garbage can model. Also, trade fairs have\nbeen found to be organizational forms that have permeable, fluid\nparticipation, and diversified and spontaneous in terms of individual goals\nand actions, once again displaying traits characteristic of the model.^[6]\n\nSeveral fields such as higher education, the policy-government world, and\nacademic research, are discussed further below.\n\n### Higher education[edit]\n\nThe American college or university is, in a way, a prototypical organized\nanarchy.^[7] Students constantly enter and leave the institution, and the\nfaculty and staff working there for longer periods of time may have many\ncompeting demands on their attention and resources, such as course\ninstruction, research, and conference travel. Different academic departments\nmay prioritize different, and even competing, goals for the university.\nUniversity senates, in particular, provide an opportunity to see the\ncharacteristics of organized anarchy and the garbage can model in action.^[3]\nThese senates largely serve symbolic meaning making functions for participants\nto express themselves through their membership, commitment to professional\nvalues, and maintaining relationships.^[3] Often, committees that report to\nthe senate take so long to work on their issue, due to constraints on\nparticipant time, or difficulty matching problems with solutions, that by the\ntime the committee produces anything, the issue has already passed on.^[8]\nHence, this provides an example for how the decision was already made, by the\ngarbage can model's decision outcome of flight, where decisions are taken\nafter problems have already gone away. The university senate is known for this\nlatency.^[3]\n\n### Public policy[edit]\n\nGovernment can be viewed as an organized anarchy.^[9] The actors (politicians)\ncan consistently change with election cycles. There are multiple, often\ncompeting, preferences. Problems arise from current events, and can gain or\nlose focus based on media coverage. Policies may be proposed by think tanks or\nlobby groups, but these policies may not gain attention until the right\nsituation arises that promotes their relevance. John W. Kingdon built on the\nideas of organized anarchy to examine these dynamics in his \"Multiple Streams\nApproach\", adapted for the field of public policy^[9] Kingdon renamed some of\nthe terms familiar in the garbage can model. Problems remain termed as\nproblems, but solutions became renamed as policies, and participants were\ntermed as politics. These streams converge, or, as Kingdon says, couple, in\nthe policy window (choice opportunity). Ambiguity, competition, an imperfect\nselection process, actors having limited time, and decision-making processes\nbeing neither \"comprehensively rational\" nor linear, are several key elements\nof multiple streams approach that clearly reflect the general properties of\norganized anarchy.^[10]\n\n### Research in psychology[edit]\n\nThe research process in the field of social sciences, particularly in\npsychology, can be interpreted as an organized anarchy.^[11] The academic\nfield of psychology is much more a loose collection of ideas and theories,\nrather than a coherent structure with a shared intellectual paradigm.\nTechnologies used to conduct research may not be fully understood. Methods for\nanalyzing data, or conducting research, are taken from other fields when the\nneed arises. Participation in the research process is fluid, with some\nresearch being done by students, other research being done by professors who\nmay publish one or a few articles and then not continue as a researcher, and\nother research being done by people who make the research process their life-\nlong profession. Joanne Martin recognized these characteristics of organized\nanarchy, and applied an adapted version of the garbage can model to the\npsychological research process.^[11] Martin's model restyled the original\nmodel's four streams. Problems took the parameters of theoretical problems.\nSolutions were seen as the results of the research process. Choice\nopportunities were understood as the selection of which methodology to use for\nthe research. Finally, the stream for participants was re-termed resources, to\nreflect that, unlike in organizational decision making, not only were actors\nrequired to move the decision/research process forward, but specific\nintellects and skill-sets could also be required, as well as financing, study\nsubjects, and access to certain environments for conducting the research in.\nThe garbage can model of the psychological research process describes how and\nwhy some research topics may go unaddressed, certain theoretical problems may\nbe linked with only a single methodological approach, researchers may continue\nto work on the same issues throughout their careers, some methods may be\nseldom applied, and how and why the field may appear to make little progress\nat times.^[11]\n\n## Current use and future growth of the model[edit]\n\nThe garbage can model continues to appear in academic articles, textbooks, and\nthe press, being applied across many diverse domains. Features of organized\nanarchy have increased in modern times, and many attempts have been made to\ncontribute to the theoretical discourse of the garbage can model by extending\nit to include new components. For example, fluid participation, a key\ncharacteristic of organized anarchy, has greatly increased since the original\nmodel was formulated.^[12] Some recent research has sought to contribute to\nthe theoretical discourse of the model, by finding leadership style to be a\nkey predictor of decision structure in organized anarchy.^[13] Other recent\nresearch has found problems with the computer simulation model used in the\noriginal article by Cohen, March, and Olsen, suggesting that decision making\nstyles have not been sufficiently analyzed.^[14]\n\nIn 2012, the volume The Garbage Can Model of Organizational Choice: Looking\nForward at Forty was published, containing a collection of papers celebrating\n40 years since the original article on the garbage can model was\nintroduced.^[15] The papers collected in the volume present theories of\norganizational decision processes that build on the original garbage can\nmodel, at times adding new ideas to create a hybrid extension of the original,\nand at other times perhaps violating the original model's core assumptions,\nthereby proposing alternatives to the existing model. Some of these papers\nattempt to attach elements of economic reasoning based on rational action\nassumptions onto the model.^[15] Many of the volume's chapters address the\nproblem of agency, to which the garbage can model offered a solution based on\na temporal, instead of a consequential, ordering of organizational\nevents.^[15] Some of the newer models that have been proposed make assumptions\nreturning to a consequential view of decision making, as well as assuming that\nindividual preferences may play a larger role in the process.\n\nThe volume's papers collectively suggest that the next logical stage of\nevolution for the garbage can model may be to directly model complex network\ndependencies linking participants, solutions, problems, and choice\nopportunities, or overall, social processes, within organizations.^[16]^[15]\nTaken as a whole, the volume contributes to defining an intellectual agenda\nthat may well extend far beyond the next forty years of organizational\nresearch.^[15]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d ^e ^f ^g ^h ^i ^j ^k ^l ^m ^n ^o ^p ^q ^r ^s ^t ^u ^v ^w ^x ^y ^z ^aa ^ab ^ac ^ad ^ae ^af ^ag ^ah ^ai ^aj ^ak ^al ^am ^an ^ao ^ap ^aq ^ar Cohen, M.D.; March, J.G.; Olsen, J.P.
