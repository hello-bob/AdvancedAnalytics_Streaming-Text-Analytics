Where are they getting this data? Is WhatsApp sharing it?\n\nLavender is Israel's system of \"pre-crime\" [3] - they use AI to guess who to\nkill in Gaza, and then bomb them when they're at home, along with their entire\nfamily. (Obscenely, they call this program \"Where's Daddy\").\n\nOne input to the AI is whether you're in a WhatsApp group with a suspected\nmember of Hamas. There's a lot wrong with this - I'm in plenty of WhatsApp\ngroups with strangers, neighbours, and in the carnage in Gaza you bet people\nare making groups to connect.\n\nBut the part I want to focus on is whether they get this information from\nMeta. Meta has been promoting WhatsApp as a \"private\" social network,\nincluding \"end-to-end\" encryption of messages.\n\nProviding this data as input for Lavender undermines their claim that WhatsApp\nis a private messaging app. It is beyond obscene and makes Meta complicit in\nIsrael's killings of \"pre-crime\" targets and their families, in violation of\nInternational Humanitarian Law and Meta's publicly stated commitment to human\nrights. No social network should be providing this sort of information about\nits users to countries engaging in \"pre-crime\".\n\nIt's important to note that already Meta is taking extensive part in the\nIsraeli-led and US-backed genocide, including significant and well-reported\nsuppression of content supporting Palestinian freedom, as well a new\nanti-\"anti-zionist\" policy that is used to shut down dissent of Israel's\ncrimes [4].\n\nWhy is Meta doing this? Why is Meta so happy to share metadata about group\nmembership with Israel \u2013 a run-around the idea of a \"private\" social network \u2013\nand to be complicit in the genocide?\n\nLet's look at their leadership, in particular the three most senior leaders\nwho have close ties to Israel.\n\nTheir Chief Information Security Officer, Guy Rosen, is their most senior\npolicy decision maker. He is Israeli, lives in Tel Aviv [5], and was in the\nIsraeli military in Unit 8200. Unit 8200 is the Israeli NSA and is the\ndepartment that built and runs Lavender. Insiders tell me that Rosen is the\nperson most associated with the anti-\"anti-zionism\" [4] policies, and is also\nresponsible for the suppression of Palestinian content.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, Meta founder and CEO has also been a significant supporter of\nIsrael's propaganda. Zuckerberg gave $125k to Zaka, one of the groups that\ncreated and continues to spread much of the original Oct 7 false atrocity\npropaganda, including the discredited \"Oct 7 mass rape\" hoax [6].\n\nMeanwhile former COO and current Meta board member, Sheryl Sandberg, has been\non tour spreading the same discredited propaganda [6]. Claiming her advocacy\nis for victims of sexual violence, she somehow ignores the long history of\nIsraeli rape of Palestinians, especially in Israeli jails, where thousands of\nprisoners are held on \"administrative detention\" for months without trial or\nlegal representation. Combined, these demonstrate that Sandberg's tour is\nabout spreading Israeli propaganda which has been used to kill over 33,000\nPalestinians, and is not about protecting women [7].\n\nThis allyship with Israel from the most senior parts of Meta's governance \u2013\nCISO, CEO, and board member \u2013 sheds light on why Israel's military is able to\nget this information from WhatsApp, a supposedly \"private\" app.\n\n## Questions for Meta\n\nTo ensure that the world can trust WhatsApps claims of privacy and safety,\nMeta must answer the following questions:\n\n  * Did Meta provide information (including inputs or training data) used by Lavender, Gospel, or Where's Daddy to the Israeli government?\n  * How will Meta prevent private information being used by governments to kill WhatsApp users and their families?\n  * Does Meta believe that Israel's actions towards civilians in Gaza and with Lavender comply Meta's Human Rights Policy?\n  * If not, why has Meta not revoked all access to the Israeli government that may put civilians at risk?\n  * Why has Meta not released their transparency report for the 2nd half of 2023?\n  * What was the level of knowledge of WhatsApp metadata sharing with the Israeli government, including whether it was to be used for military purposes, among Meta leadership, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CISO Guy Rosen?\n  * Will Meta immediately rescind access to any WhatsApp information from the Israeli government, army, and law enforcement?\n\nWithout answering these questions, it seems impossible to take seriously any\nclaim that WhatsApp is a private messaging application.\n\n## Notes\n\n[1] From the +972 article:\n\n> Included in this guide are several examples of the \u201chundreds and thousands\u201d\n> of features that can increase an individual\u2019s rating, such as being in a\n> WhatsApp group with a known militant, changing cell phone every few months,\n> and changing addresses frequently.\n\n[2] Though, I believe \"suggested militant\" is a better name, given the\ncomplete lack of evidence or verification that Israel employs before bombing\ntheir entire family.\n\n[3] I call this pre-crime as there is no evidence provided that a crime or any\nviolence has been committed by the target, or that the target has had any part\nin violence or uprising against Israel [3b]. In fact, the +972 article makes\nclear there is no attempt at finding or reviewing evidence, nor any due\ndiligence to prove that the target is a valid target under humanitarian law.\n\n[3b] It is separately worth noting that being a member of Hamas is not illegal\nor even wrong: Israel's occupation of Gaza is illegal under international law,\nand Hamas' resistance against the IDF is legal and moral. (Hamas' October 7th\nviolence against civilians is of course illegal and immoral; in the exact same\nway as the IDF's violence against civilians before and after October 7th is\nillegal and immoral).\n\n[4] Here is Jewish Voice for Peace's thoughts on Meta's anti-zionism policy,\nvia The Intercept:\n\n> \u201cAs an anti-Zionist Jewish organization for Palestinian freedom, we are\n> horrified to learn that Meta is considering expanding when they treat\n> \u2018Zionism\u2019 \u2014 a political ideology \u2014 as the same as \u2018Jew/Jewish\u2019 \u2014 an ethno-\n> religious identity,\u201d said Dani Noble, an organizer with Jewish Voice for\n> Peace, one of the groups Meta has contacted to discuss the possible change.\n> Noble added that such a policy shift \u201cwill result in shielding the Israeli\n> government from accountability for its policies and actions that violate\n> Palestinian human rights.\u201d\n\n[5] I couldn't verify he still lives in Tel Aviv, he claims he did in 2022.\n\n[6] One of the largest pieces of Israeli propaganda that they have pushed\nrelentlessly, is that of mass sexual violence on October 7th. This is a\ndeliberate claim to dehumanize Palestinians, along with many other discredited\nOct 7 atrocity claims, to allow Israel's genocide of Gaza with the support of\nthe West. They even ran focus groups on it.\n\nDespite significant reporting, there is little to no evidence of any rapes by\nHamas on October 7, much less the widely reported \"mass rape\". Naturally, it\nis impossible to prove that something didn't happen, but the existing claims\nare being deliberately pushed despite the lack of evidence.\n\nIt is well put by Mondoweiss:\n\n> Over the past four months, a concerted propaganda campaign, mounted by the\n> Israeli government and amplified across various Western media outlets, has\n> accused Hamas of using rape as a weapon of war on October 7. Allegations\n> that Hamas planned and carried out a systematic campaign of sexual violence\n> (with acts ranging from the deeply grotesque to the outright fetishistic and\n> bizarre) have been used to paint the Palestinian resistance as inhuman and\n> to justify Israel\u2019s ongoing genocide in Gaza. Recently, analysis\n> demonstrating the fallacious nature of these claims \u2014 the fabrications,\n> factual errors, and journalistic malpractice, the non-credible witness and\n> first responder testimonies, the Israeli military affiliations of key\n> sources, as well as the absence of any forensic evidence or video or\n> photographic proof \u2014 has broken through into the mainstream.\n\nThe NYTimes story has been completely discredited, mostly due to a podcast\nmade by the story's lead reporter, Anat Schwarz, who herself said that her\ndetailed investigation found no evidence:\n\n> After seeing these interviews, Schwartz started calling people at Kibbutz\n> Be\u2019eri and other kibbutzim that were targeted on October 7 in an effort to\n> track down the story. \u201cNothing. There was nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one saw or\n> heard anything.\u201d She then reached the unit 669 paramedic who relayed to\n> Schwartz the same story he had told other media outlets, which she says\n> convinced her there was a systematic nature to the sexual violence. \u201cI say,\n> \u2018OK, so it happened, one person saw it happen in Be\u2019eri, so it can\u2019t be just\n> one person, because it\u2019s two girls. It\u2019s sisters. It\u2019s in the room.\n> Something about it is systematic, something about it feels to me that it\u2019s\n> not random,\u201d Schwartz concluded on the podcast.\n\nAn in-depth report of what evidence exists can be found in The Intercept\narticle, which links to the broad body of reporting, including from Max\nBlumenthal, Mondoweiss, the Electronic Intifada, and Tech for Palestine's own\nOct 7 Fact Check.\n\nAs many have pointed out, we must indeed believe women about the sexual\nviolence they experience. However, there are not in fact any women making\nclaims about sexual violence they experienced on October 7th. Indeed, Haaretz\nreports that police cannot find the alleged victims, nor connect evidence to\nthem. There is one alleged victim from the NYTimes story, and their family\ndenies it. In fact, Zaka, the first responders who are the primacy source of\ndiscredited October 7 propaganda admit that the evidence is their\n\"imagination\":\n\n> Its workers are not trained forensic scientists or crime scene experts.\n> \u201cWhen we go into a house, we use our imagination,\u201d said Yossi Landau, a\n> senior Zaka official, describing the group\u2019s work at the October 7 attack\n> sites. \u201cThe bodies were telling us what happened, that\u2019s what happened.\u201d\n> Landau is featured in the Times report, though no mention is made of his\n> well-documented track record of disseminating sensational stories of\n> atrocities that were later proven false.\n\nEvery claim I've seen about sexual violence is eventually traced to Zaka's\ninvented claims, including all news reports I've seen in Israeli and Western\nmedia. These claims are often laundered by pointing to other reports such as\nthe NY Times, or through the non-investigative report from United Nations\nSpecial Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict Pramila Pattent, which\nwas also based on the same claims without any further investigation.\n\n[7] A similar point was made about her book, Lean In, when it was published in\n2013. Rather than addressing systemic issues in the workplace, many felt she\ntold women to suck it up and deal with it and that her advocacy was actually\nabout supporting existing power structures instead of women, like she is\nsupporting Israeli propaganda today.\n\n#### Comments (7)\n\n### Subscribe to Paul Biggar\n\nGet notified when I have some thoughts\n\nPaul Biggar \u00a9 2024.
