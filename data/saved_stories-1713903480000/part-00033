There are\nusually 20-30 folks; we\u2019ll cook dinner starting at 6:30, eat at 7pm.\n\n(You\u2019re invited!)\n\n### What makes Taco Tuesday different from a typical house party?\n\n  * Regular\n    * People make friends through repeated, unplanned interactions. A weekly recurring event provides a great default for this. After coming a few times, you start to remember the folks who you\u2019ve met, what matters in their lives, how they are doing.\n      * Most social events are one-off things, which means the energy and spark of meeting someone new, fades as you return to your daily life.\n      * People often complain about it being hard to make friends outside of school \u2014 this is what school did well.\n      * One thing religion gets really right: Sunday mass is a schelling point for making loose informal connections.\n      * Helps solve the \u201cbaked goods theory of social friendship\u201d\n    * Taco Tuesday also provides a great excuse for seeing people again. If I bump into someone new who I really vibe with, before leaving I\u2019ll try to invite them to Taco Tuesday.\n      * Protip: people love being invited to things. Even if they can\u2019t make it, they might reciprocate by inviting me to the next thing they\u2019re doing.\n    * For returning guests: Taco Tuesday is always at the same time (6:30pm on Tuesday) and at the same location, so it\u2019s easy to remember\n      * And planting a flag and putting it in the name of the event means that people can start remembering to block of Tuesdays evenings for this\n      * Tuesdays are good because it\u2019s basically a random weeknight, which rarely conflicts with That Big Party You Were Excited To Go To.\n  * Open\n    * Everyone is welcome! There\u2019s no invite list or inclusion criteria or attendance cap - you (yes you!) are welcome.\n    * The answer to \u201ccan I bring friends\u201d is always \u201cyes!\u201d\n      * This is a great way to introduce new blood to our little scene. We especially welcome 1) folks visiting from out of town, and 2) folks who have just moved to SF; these people have the most to gain from meeting others at an event!\n    * One small bit of design that helps newcomers: everyone wears a nametag. Yeah, these often feel kind of clunky and a bit uncool, but they\u2019re super helpful if this is your first time here.\n  * Low-friction\n    * Event organizers often put a lot of effort into making their events \u201cgood\u201d. Over a few days, one might send out invites, pick up groceries, find decorations or a theme, and cook for hours beforehand \u2014 all for a single party.\n    * Key advantages to always doing tacos:\n      * Always doing the same thing means that I conserve mental effort when shopping and cooking.\n      * Tacos cook pretty quickly (just stir-fry a bunch of stuff) and lend themselves to parallelization\n      * Tacos are self-serve, so you can pick out the ingredients and ratios of things that you like\n    * I don\u2019t bother crafting invites, I just broadcast in a few places (Discord, FB messenger group, Manifold market). People come via 1) memory, 2) reminders, 3) word-of-mouth-invites.\n  * Collaborative\n    * Most hosts try to have everything neat and tidy for the guests. At Taco Tuesday, we put you to work.\n    * The first 2-4 people to show up are press-ganged into helping with the kitchen: chopping up onions, bell peppers, avocados; stir-frying veggies and Beyond meat.\n      * Cooking together is great for bonding \u2014 you have to solve the nontrivial logistics problem of preparing food for 30 people, as quickly as possible. It\u2019s attacking a real problem, in the real world (Overcooked IRL!) A bunch of us are knowledge workers and cooking is a good change of pace.\n    * Cleaning up afterwards: hosts often say things like \u201cdon\u2019t worry about the dishes\u201d or \u201cwe\u2019ll take care of the cleanup\u201d. I think this attitude of hosting-as-sacrifice is quite bad as it makes hosting so much less sustainable. So instead, we have guests help with loading the dishwasher, scrubbing pots and plans, putting things away, etc\n    * We love having people bring snacks, desserts, and drinks to share as well! (Though we always make sure the main course ie tacos are taken care of)\n    * People really enjoy pitching in \u2014 it imbues their Taco Tuesday experience with more meaning.\n    * One more way it\u2019s collaborative: Taco Tuesday regulars will offer to host! So Taco Tuesday moves to different houses, with different chefs, or with different events. Speaking of which:\n  * Eventful\n    * A common failure mode of house parties is where the main thing on offer is \u201ctalking to people\u201d. (cf Every Bay Area House Party). I don\u2019t know about you, but I can tolerate like 20 minutes of this before my eardrums are complaining at the noise level and I feel all talked out.\n    * Taco Tuesday supports \u201ctalking to people\u201d for you extraverts who actually like talking, but we also try to provide alternative options. Each week I try to change it up with some other theme or activity. Some of our more popular themes:\n      * Book swap\n        * Going around saying something about a book lets out a bit of your personality. Books are often things that people don\u2019t talk that much about.\n      * Night hike\n        * Walking around the city at night in a group is a lot of fun. Hiking is great for conversations: better volume dynamics compared to being indoors, supports better mixing of conversational groups, provides novel stimuli from the environment as topics to discuss, something about walking stimulates the brain, etc.\n        * There\u2019s also a small thrill of \u201coh this is unusual/we shouldn\u2019t be doing this\u201d, esp if we\u2019re sneaking in to a park after hours.\n      * Karaoke\n        * Choosing songs also has an element of \u201cshowing off a bit of your personality\u201d. And singing together is super bonding, requires everyone to model how everyone else is acting and getting in sync, mind-melding\n      * Puzzled Pint\n        * Once again: forming small teams and tackling a challenge together, is a great experience\n        * Puzzles are a form of intellectual play; working through one with a friend, pitching ideas, looking for the answer, and racing against other teams \u2014 chefs kiss\n      * Board games\n        * Oldie but goodie. Many people who don\u2019t want to be talking all the time, absolutely love strategizing over Splendor or scheming as a Secret Hitler\n\n### History\n\nTaco Tuesday started 3 years ago, during the pandemic. My friends Karthik,\nMichael, and Dan were getting bored of shelter-in-place and illicitly invited\nme over for tacos. Breaking quarantine was so joyful, and I wanted to keep\ndoing it \u2014 we settled into a pattern of seeing each other and making great\ntacos.\n\nTaco Tuesday has gone through 4 or 5 different \u201cdefault houses\u201d over its\nyears.\n\n### Misc\n\n  * Prediction markets!\n  * Taco Tuesday got funded by Francisco San\n  * Taco Tuesday is responsible for two relationships forming! One of which through a Valentine\u2019s Day singles mixer; another more organically. (Both couples have now separated though so caveat emptor).\n  * In the news!\n  * Photos\n\n", "frontpage": false}
