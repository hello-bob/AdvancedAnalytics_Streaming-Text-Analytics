It tries to outline some real\nissues that require years of context to fully grasp. Without having this\nnecessary context - it is very hard to follow some of the points made, and\nevidence seems very poor.\n\nThis repository aims to list some key points that are easy to understand\nwithout all of the context. This is a compilation of damning evidence for\nEelco's leadership, essentially.\n\nIf you're looking for a TL;DR of the situation, here it is:\n\n  * Nix community had a governance crisis for years. While there has been progress on building explicit teams to govern the project, it continued to fundamentally rely on implicit authority and soft power\n  * Eelco Dolstra, as one of the biggest holders of this implicit authority and soft power, has continuously abused this authority to push his decisions, and to block decisions that he doesn't like\n  * Crucially, he also used his implicit authority to block any progress on solving this governance crisis and establishing systems with explicit authority\n  * This has led uncountably many people to burn out over the issue, and culminated in writing an open letter to have Eelco resign from all formal positions in the project and take a 6 month break from any involvement in the community\n  * Eelco wrote a response that largely dismisses the issues brought up, and advertises his company's community as a substitute for Nix community\n\n## Open Letter\n\nLinks: live, WaybackMachine\n\n> Graham Christensen has written on Twitter that he believes that military-\n> technology companies should be allowed to participate in the community so\n> that they don\u2019t fork the project.\n\nAnduril is not forbidden to contribute to Nix. People take issue with Anduril\nsponsoring the main Nix community event. This sponsorship isn't the same as\njust donating money. The sponsors of the main community event are understood\nto be very close to values of the project. Anduril, a military tech company,\ndoes not represent the values of the project.\n\nUnlike donation or contribution, being a sponsor comes with many strings\nattached. Sponsors are commonly given a special shoutout: that would make\nNixCon advertise and endorce Anduril. Anduril is not only a commercial\ncompany, it's also very controversial: it contracts for the US Military, and\nit also develops software to prevent people from crossing US-Mexican border.\nThis is a very political and controversial business to have, and NixCon\ndirectly associating itself with Anduril sponsorship means that the project\nsupports the values of Anduril.\n\nThis tweet is an attempt at sabotaging the discussion, as it purposefully\nmisses the point.\n\n> The CCC VOC (video operation centre) threatened to pull out of NixCon 2023\n> at the last minute over the Anduril sponsorship and effectively prevent the\n> conference operating, and the NixOS Foundation lost a huge amount of good\n> will over their management of this incident. The sponsorship was dropped\n> after such intense public pressure as well as to mitigate potential contract\n> risks with the university hosting it (due to zivilklausel).\n\nThis adds to the point above. The main sponsor of the main community event\nrepresents the values of the project. CCC VOC, as well as the host university,\nboth don't share the values of Anduril - and so they had a major issue with\nNix project embracing those values.\n\n> Eelco holds onto hard power and blocks giving it away even if there is\n> consensus on giving it away by other members of his team. This is corrosive\n> to the team having psychological safety and agency to make decisions, as\n> well as its ability to be independent from him. It cements him as the prime\n> authority in the project by dismantling others.\n\nTo put it simply: he overrules the decision of CppNix by himself, despite\nhaving no more formal authority.\n\n> Single-handedly blocking Meson, which has a passed RFC, for five years\n> because he doesn\u2019t know meson but knows his own build system: NixOS/nix#3160\n> (comment) and https://discourse.nixos.org/t/2024-04-03-nix-team-\n> meeting-135/42962\n\nThis is not entirely correct. Five years have passed since the Meson idea was\npitched. Of those, 3.5 years Eelco enjoyed implicit monopoly on CppNix - and\nhasn't contributed to bringing Meson closer to reality. Then, roughly at the\nsame time, Meson RFC (which is still open) and Nix team were created. In those\n1.5 years, the team figured out the internal stuff and was discussing on how\nto proceed with Meson. Only recently (last month) progress was made on\nstarting the migration to Meson.\n\nOverall, the issue is more complex than just Eelco blocking the migration for\nfive years. The example chosen is a poor one.\n\nYou can read this for more details: #1\n\n> Eelco ignored repeated calls to disclose anything about whether he has a\n> conflict of interest with respect to Anduril, one of which follows:\n>\n> Graham claimed they have NDAs preventing them from disclosing whether they\n> are entangled with Anduril.\n\nNDA requires two or more parties to enter into a legally binding contract.\nThat suggests that DetSys and Anduril were heavily considering partnership, at\nthe very least. Being potential partners with Anduril already constitutes a\nconflict of interest, and it is not addressed at all.\n\nAlso, there are ways to answer the question about having a conflict of\ninterest that don't breach NDA. You don't have to outright confirm or deny if\nyou are working with Anduril - you can just say if you have conflict of\ninterest or not. The fact that no one had done that, and the long history of\nEelco dodging the question, suggests that the conflict of interest is\ndefinitely present.\n\n## Response\n\nLinks: live, Archive, WaybackMachine\n\nEelco responds on DetSys website instead of using the community channels. This\nheavily implies what the primary audience is (DetSys investors, not NixOS\ncommunity).\n\n> First, I have had very little involvement in Nixpkgs and NixOS in recent\n> years, having ceded their stewardship to other community members some time\n> ago, and have no more influence over their direction than any other\n> dedicated contributor.\n\nThe letter hasn't implied any involvement in Nixpkgs and NixOS. The letter\ndiscusses in excruciating detail Eelco's involvement in CppNix.\n\n> Second, I am just one member of the five-member Nix team and hold no more\n> formal authority than the others in determining the direction of the team.\n\nThis is a lie. Eelco is not just a member of the team - he is a team lead.\nThis clearly means he holds more formal authority. This information is\navailable on official website:\n\nAlso, Eelco is a chair of Foundation. \"chair\" as in \"president\". Implying most\nauthority. This constitutes elevated authority - even if Eelco lacks enough\nauthority as a teamlead, he can always weigh in as a chair of Foundation. This\ninformation is available on the official website:\n\n> Third, I have not been a member of the RFC Steering Committee since new\n> members were elected in January 2024.\n\nCool. The RFC process was established since Feb 11, 2017. RFC 36, which\nestablishes RFC Steering Committee, was merged on Dec 25, 2018. This leaves a\nperiod of almost 2 years where Eelco had complete authority over the process.\n\nNext, RFC 43, which establishes RFC Steering Committee rotation, was merged on\nJun 11, 2019. This outlines a very clear procedure for changing members of RFC\nSteering Committee. Eelco was part of the RFC Steering Committee until January\n2024 - for 4.5 years. As a member of RFC Steering Committee, he had associated\nformal authority.\n\nAdditionally, the infamous RFC 49 was open by Eelco himself. In December 2023,\nEelco was teamlead of Nix team, chair of Nix Foundation, as well as RFC\nSteering Committee member. Back when RFC 49 was open, only RFC Steering\nCommittee was established, but Eelco had all the current power and way more\n(without any transparency or accountability).\n\nRFC 49 has done immeasurable damage to the Nix project. Flakes were merged\nupstream before the RFC even reached FCP. Eelco clearly abused his authority\nas lead developer of CppNix to push flakes, made a joke of the RFC process,\nand contributed to the degradation of the governance model. RFC was withdrawn,\nwhich suggests that community decided against the feature - but the community\nhad to accept Flakes as an experimental feature, because it was already merged\ninto CppNix. Flakes being merged against the RFC process and marked as\n\"experimental\" (and marketed as production-ready) caused multiple technical\nand governance issues: ridiculous amounts of regressions in Nix 2.4,\nmotivating RFC 68, RFC 106, RFC 134, RFC 136 and RFC 158.\n\nEelco had done such a poor job at managing RFC 49 and its consequences, that\nit is grounds enough to remove him from any positions of authority and\ntemporarily embargo his contributions. He has not faced any responsibility for\nthis, and held onto his authority. This has done a lot of damage to the\ncommunity in general, and it's only now that we're starting to catch up with\nthe thought that he should be held accountable for this disaster.\n\n> Fourth, the NixOS Foundation in no way controls or governs the Nix\n> community, which has, since its inception, demonstrated its ability to self-\n> govern very well.\n\nThis is true. And this is a large part of the issue. Nix community has no\nauthority. It is governed by implicit authority of long-time contributors\n(such as Eelco). So despite Foundation having no formal control - people with\nstrong background in the community have informal control, and some of those\npeople (like Eelco) are blocking doing it any other way.\n\n> I strongly believe that we should not exclude any company from contributing\n> to, participating in, or utilizing the Nix project in any way.\n\nThis intentionally misses the point. No one says anything about excluding\nAnduril from participating or contributing to the Nix project. People have a\nlarge issue with Anduril being a sponsor of the main community event. This is\nnot simply \"donating money\", nor is it \"contributing\" - this is being direct\nassociates and partners. If a company sponsors the main event - it is not\n\"just using the project\", it is driving its governance.\n\n> My role, participation, and focus on the good work being done at Determinate\n> Systems have been public knowledge since the company\u2019s inception.\n\nThis is a lie. Quoting the letter:\n\n> Although Eelco is supposedly a founder of Determinate Systems (we are unsure\n> if this was the case as of the time of founding or if it was changed\n> retroactively), there was a period of multiple months before Eelco disclosed\n> his involvement in DetSys, at the very least not in a way that appeared in\n> open board meeting minutes or on Discourse.\n\n> The assertion that Determinate Systems \u201cowns\u201d Nix or seeks to exert outsized\n> influence over the project, the community, or the foundation is patently\n> false: I am the only member of the Nix team who works for Determinate\n> Systems.\n\nThis is a lie. Quoting the letter:\n\n> However, the reason for existence of the Determinate Systems installer\n> appears to be that they want to take responsibility for the stability of\n> flakes themselves. This is fine, however, it is questionably acceptable to\n> do that while employing the lead developer of CppNix and saying nothing\n> about how this will interact with the team\u2019s decisionmaking autonomy. In\n> effect, Eelco has privatized the release process of CppNix into DetSys by\n> being in both CppNix and DetSys, the DetSys installer existing and having a\n> release process, and by not fixing nix upgrade-nix, whether that is\n> deliberate or not, such that the only way to get a working upstream CppNix\n> is to rely on DetSys. Relatedly, the Nix repo now depends on the DetSys\n> installer by his PR.\n\n> Regarding alleged conflicts of interest, I want to be very clear.\n\nWhat about the alleged conflicts of interest, by the way? No mention of\nAnduril being a business partner of DetSys? No mention of Anduril being an\nundesired sponsor of NixCon? No mention of Eelco expressing his opinion in\nfavor of Anduril?\n\n> I remain committed to creating a community where everyone feels seen, heard,\n> and valued, and I will not let unfounded accusations detract from this\n> important work. I encourage everyone reading this who feels that they have\n> not been heard or feels displaced to join the Determinate Systems community\n> as we continue working to make Nix as easy to use and as impactful as\n> possible. Our code of conduct is available here, and you can join our\n> Discord at https://determinate.systems/discord.\n\nSo if someone feels unsafe in the Nix community due to Eelco's mismanagement\nof the community - they are welcome to join the DetSys community. Not only is\nthis absurd, it's also an outright confirmation that Eelco grossly mismanaged\nNix community, and instead of owning up to those mistakes - focused on making\nhis own.\n\nTo call this disgusting would be an understatement. Instead of taking proper\nresponsibility - somehow Eelco still has the audacity to try and use the\nfallout of his poor decisions for his gain, by announcing himself and DetSys\nas de-facto owners of the project.\n\n## Moderation and RFC 98\n\nAs explained, there is a major governance crisis in Nix community. People\ntried to solve it multiple times, but every time it was blocked - regardless\nof how it was pitched. This is the reason why the conflict was escalated to\nthe open letter format.\n\nThere is a common misunderstanding about the role of Moderation Team in Nix\ncommunity. To understand the unique position of Moderation Team, we have to\ndiscuss the RFC 98, its premises and consequences.\n\nRFC 98 is ambitious. It doesn't just try to establish a Moderation Team that\nwill monitor official spaces and ban people who are obviously acting out of\nill intent (such as trolls, bots, and spammers) - it tries to establish a team\nthat will have direct authority over people in the community and in the other\nteams without having authority to decide the technical goals.\n\nFor example, such a team would be able to suspend or ban Eelco once many\npeople expressed their dissatisfaction with his actions, and no compromise\ncould be found. This would've solved the issue more gracefully, and would've\nsolved a large part of the governance crisis that we see. It would still leave\nthe question of technical leadership open (the team proposed by RFC 98 doesn't\ncoordinate technical decisions), but it would solve the social aspect.\n\nThis would, of course, put a lot of power into the hands of one team. This\nraises quite a few concerns. The RFC is aware of this:\n\n> Making this system work without precise rules requires mutual trust between\n> members of the community and the community team. The community team will\n> model social norms by holding themselves to a high standard of behavior.\n\nAs evident, this mutual trust wasn't in place. Despite some nitpicking, the\ninitial reception was very positive. However, what followed was not only\npositive feedback, but also doubt that there are issues to fix, calling out\nthe author on their non-Nix activism, calling out the author and doubting\ntheir authority, doubting their authority again, fundamental distrust towards\nthe proposed team in general, concerns about establishing dictatorship, more\ndistrust, US politics, dismissing concern for the future.\n\nThe goal isn't to call people out on disagreeing with the RFC: it's to provide\nconcrete examples. Ultimately, what we were left is discussion that aged like\nmilk, several posts predicting the horrible outcome we turned out to have\n(one, two), moving RFC to draft after a period of radio silence, and\ndismantling of the RFC altogether after years of radio silence. Partially-\noverlapping RFC 114 was also closed.\n\nUltimately, the Moderation system that we have today is built after RFC 102,\nwhich is a lot more narrow in the design. Interestringly, the approved RFC\ntext mentions this:\n\n> The role of the moderation team could evolve through an effort similar to\n> RFC 98 into taking a broader community leadership responsibility as a\n> 'Leadership Team' or 'Community Team'.\n\nThis seems to describe the situation that is currently happening, and that is\ncausing a lot of controversy. Ultimately, it is RFC 98 being implemented years\nlater than it should've been.\n\n## Additional Input\n\n### Delroth\n\nDelroth is the person who is mentioned a few times in the open letter, who has\ndone a lot of good work on Nix Infra. He started a thread on Mastodon,\nclarifying some points and adding more context.\n\nLinks: live, WaybackMachine\n\n> The commentary on Eelco sitting on leadership roles and not doing anything +\n> not allowing contributions fully reflects my experience with joining the\n> #NixOS infra team. When I expressed interest to join the infra team when it\n> was clearly understaffed and malfunctioning, this was blocked for 6 months\n> by Eelco, even though I was supported by the foundation board member\n> nominally in charge of infra.

This describes how hard\nit is to change the systematic issues in Nix community as long as Eelco is in\nplace.\n\n## About\n\nThis is a repository that aims to concisely explain the issues in Nix\ncommunity\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nCC-BY-SA-4.0 license\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n124 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n5 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n1 fork\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
