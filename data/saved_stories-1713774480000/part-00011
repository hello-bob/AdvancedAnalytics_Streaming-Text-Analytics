That's just some of\nwhat Nigerian chess master Tunde Onakoya had to suffer through to break the\nGuinness World Record for the longest ever chess marathon. All for a noble\ncause.\n\nAt the iconic Times Square in New York, Onakoya overcame physical discomfort\nand fatigue to hit the extraordinary 60-hour mark of non-stop chess against NM\nShawn Martinez on Saturday morning.\n\nThe previous Guinness World Record of 56 hours and 9 minutes was set by FM\nSjur Ferkingstad and Hallvard Haug Flateb\u00f8 in Haugesund, Norway in 2018.\n\nYear| Player| Player| Place  \n---|---|---|---  \n2024| 60 hours| Tunde Onakoya| Shawn Martinez| New York, U.S.A.  \n2018| 56 hours, 9 minutes| Sjur Ferkingstad| Hallvard Haug Flateb\u00f8| Haugesund,\nNorway  \n2015| 40 hours, 40 minutes| Magne Sagafos| Joachim Berg-Jensen| Stavanger,\nNorway  \n2010| 40 hours, 20 minutes| Daniel H\u00e4ussler| Philipp Bergner| Ostfildern,\nGermany  \n  \nGuinness is yet to comment publicly or confirm the record, a process that is\nsaid to take weeks, but the chess marathon was streamed live and drew\nconsiderable attention from major media outlets such as CNN, the New York\nTimes, the BBC, and AP.\n\nHailing from Lagos, Nigeria, Onakoya is the founder of Chess in Slums Africa,\na non-profit organization whose goal is to use chess as a tool to help poor\nchildren read and write.\n\nThat has made the 29-year-old a role model for millions in Africa as he chases\nthe target of raising $1 million for children's education across the\ncontinent. With hundreds of thousands of followers on social media, his noble\ncause has also drawn global attention.\n\n> Nigerian chess master Tunde Onakoya beat the world record for the longest\n> continuous play of chess, after playing for 58 hours.
