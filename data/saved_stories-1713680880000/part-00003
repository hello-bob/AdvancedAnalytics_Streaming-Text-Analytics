The\nGlobal Health Data Exchange estimates that 251-310 million people worldwide\nsuffer from depression. While depression is common, it is also, fortunately,\ntreatable.\n\n## Symptoms of depression\n\nThe symptoms of depression can range from mild to severe and include the\nfollowing:\n\n  * A persistent feeling of sadness\n  * Loss of interest in activities once enjoyed\n  * Changes in appetite \u2013 weight loss or gain\n  * Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much\n  * Loss of energy or increased fatigue\n  * Increase in purposeless tasks or physical activities such as pacing\n  * Slowed movements and speech\n  * Feeling guilty or worthless\n  * Difficulty thinking or concentrating\n  * Decreased confidence and self-esteem\n  * Negative, bleak, or pessimistic attitude\n  * Self-harmful or suicidal thoughts or actions\n\n## Depression risk factors and treatment options\n\nRisk factors for depression include: biochemistry (differences in chemicals in\nthe brain), genetics (depression can be heriditary), perrsonality (those who\nare generally pessimistic or have low self-esteen are more likely to\nexperience depression), and environment (those who are exposed to violence,\nabuse, neglect or poverty are more likely to expereince depression).\n\nFor depression to be diagnosed, symptoms must last at least two weeks. Some\nmedical conditions, such as thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies, can\nmimic symptoms of depression and need to be ruled out. Luckily, depression is\none of the most treatable mental illnesses, and those who have been diagnosed\nhave multiple options depending on their diagnosis:\n\n  * Anti-depressant medication may be prescribed to help correct and/or stablize one\u2019s brain chemistry.\n  * Psychotherapy and/or cognitive behavioral therapy are often used to help individuals work through depression. Therapy is often combined with anti-depressants for moderate to severe depression.\n  * Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a medical treatment most commonly used for patients diagnosed with severe depression who have not responded to other treatments. It involves a brief electrical stimulation of the brain while the patient is under anesthesia.\n\n## Depression Rates Around the World\n\nDepression affects about 1 in 15 adults in any given year, and 1 in 6 people\nwill experience depression at some time in their life. An Our World In Data\nstudy estimates about 3.4% (2-6% when including the margin of error) of the\nglobal population has depression. This is about 264 million people worldwide.\nAccording to WHO estimates, the ten countries with the highest prevalence of\ndepression are:\n\n## Top 10 Countries with the Highest Rates of Depression:\n\nCountry| Prevalence  \n---|---  \nUkraine| 6.3%  \nUnited States| 5.9%  \nAustralia| 5.9%  \nEstonia| 5.9%  \nBrazil| 5.8%  \nGreece| 5.7%  \nPortugal| 5.7%  \nBelarus| 5.6%  \nFinland| 5.6%  \nLithuania| 5.6%  \n  \nWhile countries with high rates of depression appear on almost every\ncontinent, it seems the Pacific Islands of Oceania include many of the least-\ndepressed places on Earth:\n\n## Top 10 Countries with the Lowest Rates of Depression:\n\nCountry| Prevalence  \n---|---  \nSolomon Islands| 2.9%  \nPapua New Guinea| 3%  \nTimor Leste| 3%  \nVanuatu| 3.1%  \nKiribati| 3.1%  \nMicronesia| 3.1%  \nNepal| 3.2%  \nLaos| 3.2%  \nSamoa| 3.2%  \nTonga| 3.2%  \n  \n## Interpreting data on depression\n\nWhile the numbers listed above (and below) are valuable and vital, it is\nimportant to keep in mind that the true rates are likely much higher,\nespecially in less developed countries. Depression is much more likely to be\ndiagnosed in highly developed countries, whose more robust health care\ninfrastructures are far better equipped to identify and treat mental\nillnesses.\n\nTherefore, less developed countries do not necessarily have less\ndepression\u2014rather, their treatment of mental illnesses often takes a back seat\nto broader concerns such as hunger, disease, and sanitation. In fact, the\nWorld Health Organization estimates that 76\u201385% of people suffering from\nmental disorders in low- and middle-income countries lack access to the\nnecessary treatment. Moreover, even in developed nations, many cases of mental\nillness go undiagnosed and unreported because the patients are either ashamed\nof their illness or unaware that it's a medically treatable condition.\n\nDepression rates are rising around the world, but it's likely that this rise\nis due at least in part to a good thing: More patients than ever before are\nseeking and receiving treatment for mental illness rather than going\nundiagnosed. In many countries, including the United States, the stigma\nsurrounding mental illnesses is gradually decreasing. This enables a more open\ndiscussion of mental illness and makes people more likely to seek help when\nthey need it.\n\nA nation\u2019s culture can also have a significant impact on both the mental\nhealth of its population and the availability of mental health treatment\nservices. Additionally, certain symptoms of depression are more common in some\nsocieties than others due to cultural factors. For example, while depression\nis relatively uncommon in Japan, suicide rates are high for children and teens\nages 10-19. This is most likely due to pressure to do well in school and work\nand conform to group norms.\n\nAn estimated 17.3 million adults in the United States had a least one major\ndepressive episode in 2017. Among those diagnosed with depression, about 65%\nreceived treatment. About 50% of U.S. adults diagnosed with depression are\nalso diagnosed with anxiety. Oregon, West Virginia, and Maine have the highest\ndepression rates.\n\nCSV JSON\n\n### Download Table Data\n\nCountry| Prevalence| Cases  \n---|---|---  \nUkraine| 6.3%| 2,800,587  \nUnited States|
