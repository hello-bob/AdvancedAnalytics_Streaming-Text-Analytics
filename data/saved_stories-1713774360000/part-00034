Can this be remedied?\n\nThe term \u201cbuilding acoustics\u201d refers to buildings and the transmission of\nsounds between their structural elements such as floors, walls etc. Loud\nbackground noise is a common problem in public spaces which can lead to\nexhaustion and irritability. Designers tend to focus on the visual aspect of\nrooms whilst disregarding the impact of their design on the acoustic\nexperience. Nowadays, it is a recurring phenomenon to come across beautiful\nopen spaces with extremely poor acoustic properties.\n\n## What is reverb?\n\nThe main acoustic problem for noisy places typically relates to reverberation.\nThis acoustic effect is produced as sound waves interact with the boundaries\nof a room. As sound waves travel and strike hard surfaces they are reflected\nback, superposing with the original incident sound. This reflection of sound\nwaves will continue even after the original sound source has stopped. Hard\nflat surfaces, such as timber floors, tables and large tiled walls, all of\nwhich are commonly found in restaurants, contribute to the problem. If hard\nsurfaces dominate a restaurant very little noise is absorbed and their\nacoustic reflections could negatively affect a room.\n\n## What is \u201creverberation time\u201d and why is it important for your restaurant?\n\nReverberation is normally used in auditoriums and music venues as a technique\nin order to add warmth to the sound of the room. It can, however, affect the\nintelligibility of speech or produce undesired coloration of the sound.\n\nReverberation is normally measured in units of time. Acousticians tend to\nassess the reverberation characteristics of a room by a reverberation time\n(i.e. RT60). RT60 is the time taken for the sound pressure level to decay by\n60 dB in a room. In restaurants the intelligibility of speech is important,\ntherefore it is crucial to achieve a minimal value for RT60 as this will have\nan impact on the conversations of customers. In a nutshell, for speech\nintelligibility, a low reverberation time is desirable.\n\n## How to improve the acoustics of a noisy restaurant\n\nGenerally, the most cost-effective and simple solution is to add \u2018\u2019soft\u2019\u2019\nsurfaces to a reverberant room. These soft surfaces will absorb the sound and\ntherefore reduce reverberation. Standard techniques typically require the\ninstallation of artefacts such as acoustic dispersers, bass traps, acoustic\npanels, acoustic insulation or other sound absorbing objects.\n\nAlthough sound absorbers tend to be the best solution, careful installation is\nrequired. It is important to understand the characteristics of the room and\nwhat makes the sound behave the way it does. The best way to fully understand\nits characteristics is to undertake an acoustic measurement. This will lead to\nan indication of the acoustic product to install and where would it perform at\nthe best of its capabilities.\n\n## Designing for Sound\n\nOften, people only start thinking about building acoustics once they\nexperience an actual problem. Acoustics should be part of the design process\nfor a restaurant, requiring a close collaboration between all teams involved\nto achieve the best result.\n\nIf you are thinking about opening a new restaurant and are worried about how\nacoustics are going to affect the customer experience, there are a series of\nsteps you can take to ensure a success.\n\nStep 1: Detect the source of undesired noise and define what kind of sound you\nwant to have in your space. Are you interested in a cosy/quiet restaurant or a\nmusic venue? Remember, reverberation is important! Choose a low reverberation\ntime if you are designing a restaurant.\n\nStep 2: Pay close attention to the characteristics of the room. This will\nindicate where it is best to put the acoustic treatment. Does your venue have\nhigh ceilings? Parallel walls? If so, you may want to damp those surfaces with\nacoustic absorbers to reduce the reverberation time.\n\nStep 3: Choose the right acoustic treatment. In order to reduce the\nreverberation time, it is recommended you use appropriate acoustic absorbers,\nbass traps etc. We highly recommend that, before attempting a potentially\ncostly solution, you should request a professional consultation. Feel free to\ncontact us and we can guide you to the most effective solution.\n\n## How Xi Engineering can help you with building acoustics and noise reduction\n\nEvery restaurant design is unique, which is why we uniquely tailor all our\nacoustic solutions to each project. Our service includes acoustic measurements\nwhich will allow you to identify the right solutions for your space with\nminimal compromise to the design. If the structure of your venue is at the\ndesign stage we are able to provide acoustic simulations to optimise the\nacoustic experience for your customers.\n\nTo quantify and resolve problematic acoustics, it is necessary to understand\nthe origin of the problem. Through the use of high-quality sound measurement\nequipment, such as class A sound level meters and high-end microphones, the\nexperienced team at Xi can complete acoustic measurement surveys and find\nsolutions which will satisfy your requirements.\n\nIf you experience acoustic problems, please contact us and one of our\nacoustics engineers will get in touch with you.\n\nXi Engineering2023-03-21T16:27:11+00:00\n\nFacebookXLinkedIn\n\n## Related Posts\n\n#### Strain Gauging \u2013 Why Use Them, How They Work and How We Can Help\n\n12 March 2024\n\n#### Wind Turbine Noise Amplitude Modulation\n\n28 February 2024\n\n#### Mathematical Modelling of Liquid Crystals Using COMSOL Multiphysics\n\n30 January 2024\n\n#### Machine Learning Fundamentals, Applications, and Expert Insight\n\n11 January 2024 | 0 Comments\n\n## Talk to us about your project\n\n### Talk to us about your project\n\n#### Talk to us about your project\n\nhello@xiengineering.com | +44 (0) 131 290 2250\n\nCodebase Argyle House 3 Lady Lawson Street Edinburgh, EH3 9DR\n\n\u00a9 2024 Xi Engineering Consultants | All rights reserved | SC386913\n\nPage load link\n\nGo to Top\n\n", "frontpage": false}
