All\nof our economy under the sea is under threat,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd, to be very clear, we know what Russians have developed as far as nuclear\nsubmarines to operate under the sea. So we are not naive and we [Nato\ncountries] are working together.\u201d\n\nThe comments come after two incidents of suspected sabotage on gas pipelines\nin the Baltic in the last 18 months \u2013 first on Nord Stream 1 and 2 in\nSeptember 2022, followed by the Balticconnector in October last year. Despite\nextensive investigations by multiple states both remain unsolved, although\nFinland said in December that \u201ceverything indicated\u201d a Chinese ship had\npurposely damaged the Balticconnector with its anchor.\n\nMaleterre, a submariner who said he had himself spent \u201cmore than 1,000 days\nunder the sea\u201d, said the environment had changed dramatically since much of\nthe current infrastructure was first developed by the private sector, leaving\nit extremely vulnerable.\n\n\u201cThey [the companies responsible for them] didn\u2019t know that such hybrid\nwarfare would develop so rapidly. More than 90% of [the] internet is under the\nsea. All our links between the US, Canada and Europe are transmitting under\nthe sea, so there are a lot of vulnerabilities.\u201d\n\nNord Stream attacks highlight vulnerability of undersea pipelines in west\n\nRead more\n\nDespite the increasing role of offshore wind power to meet climate goals, the\ninfrastructure still has \u201csystem vulnerabilities,\u201d he said. Offshore wind will\nneed to increase by 25% by 2050 to meet EU wind energy capacity targets,\naccording to industry association WindEurope, while the Biden administration\nwants to deploy 30,000 megawatts of offshore wind along the coastlines of the\nUS by 2030.\n\nAt any one time Maleterre said that Marcom had \u201cmore than 100 ships, nuclear\nsubmarines and conventional submarines\u201d patrolling waters including the\nArctic, Black Sea, Atlantic, Baltic and the Mediterranean.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very important concern because it\u2019s a security issue for nearly 1\nbillion Nato-nation civilians. We need to be protected and well supplied by\nour vital undersea infrastructures.\u201d\n\nBut even with a significant presence it was impossible for Nato to guard every\npiece of undersea infrastructure, he said, with primary responsibility lying\nwith nations to protect their own infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe know there are a lot of vulnerabilities ... When we have offshore\ninstallation, first of all the responsibilities are in the states\u2019 hands,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe have particular attention on the Russians at the moment, but\nit\u2019s very difficult to have a permanent surveillance of every cable; it\u2019s not\npossible. A lot of nations \u2013 Norway, Sweden, Denmark as well \u2013 have developed\ndrones, sensors, UUVs [unmanned underwater vehicles] to be able to detect very\nrapidly [something] suspicious or something going wrong.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Global Dispatch\n\nFree newsletter\n\nGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and\npictures, curated by our global development team\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

Sweden\u2019s experience in\nboth regions \u201cwill immediately increase Nato\u2019s ability to detect and deter any\nregional aggression.\n\n\u201cAnd when we talk about aggression, we think about Russia obviously,\u201d added\nMaleterre, who said Sweden\u2019s membership in particular brought submarines, mine\nwarfare ships, special forces and fast, powerful boats.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Nato\n  * Europe\n  * Russia\n  * China\n  * Nord Stream 1 pipeline\n  * Nord Stream 2 pipeline\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
