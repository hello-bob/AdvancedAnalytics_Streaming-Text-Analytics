Envy those 'lazy' strikers? In this 1932 essay,\nBertrand Russell, socialist and winner of some minor award called the Nobel\nPrize in Literature, presents the case for idleness. One can also download\nand/ or listen to an audio version here.\n\nSubmitted by wojtek on May 9, 2012\n\nCopied to clipboard\n\nLike most of my generation, I was brought up on the saying: 'Satan finds some\nmischief for idle hands to do.' Being a highly virtuous child, I believed all\nthat I was told, and acquired a conscience which has kept me working hard down\nto the present moment. But although my conscience has controlled my actions,\nmy opinions have undergone a revolution. I think that there is far too much\nwork done in the world, that immense harm is caused by the belief that work is\nvirtuous, and that what needs to be preached in modern industrial countries is\nquite different from what always has been preached. Everyone knows the story\nof the traveler in Naples who saw twelve beggars lying in the sun (it was\nbefore the days of Mussolini), and offered a lira to the laziest of them.\nEleven of them jumped up to claim it, so he gave it to the twelfth. this\ntraveler was on the right lines. But in countries which do not enjoy\nMediterranean sunshine idleness is more difficult, and a great public\npropaganda will be required to inaugurate it. I hope that, after reading the\nfollowing pages, the leaders of the YMCA will start a campaign to induce good\nyoung men to do nothing. If so, I shall not have lived in vain.\n\nBefore advancing my own arguments for laziness, I must dispose of one which I\ncannot accept. Whenever a person who already has enough to live on proposes to\nengage in some everyday kind of job, such as school-teaching or typing, he or\nshe is told that such conduct takes the bread out of other people's mouths,\nand is therefore wicked. If this argument were valid, it would only be\nnecessary for us all to be idle in order that we should all have our mouths\nfull of bread. What people who say such things forget is that what a man earns\nhe usually spends, and in spending he gives employment. As long as a man\nspends his income, he puts just as much bread into people's mouths in spending\nas he takes out of other people's mouths in earning. The real villain, from\nthis point of view, is the man who saves. If he merely puts his savings in a\nstocking, like the proverbial French peasant, it is obvious that they do not\ngive employment. If he invests his savings, the matter is less obvious, and\ndifferent cases arise.\n\nOne of the commonest things to do with savings is to lend them to some\nGovernment. In view of the fact that the bulk of the public expenditure of\nmost civilized Governments consists in payment for past wars or preparation\nfor future wars, the man who lends his money to a Government is in the same\nposition as the bad men in Shakespeare who hire murderers. The net result of\nthe man's economical habits is to increase the armed forces of the State to\nwhich he lends his savings. Obviously it would be better if he spent the\nmoney, even if he spent it in drink or gambling.\n\nBut, I shall be told, the case is quite different when savings are invested in\nindustrial enterprises. When such enterprises succeed, and produce something\nuseful, this may be conceded. In these days, however, no one will deny that\nmost enterprises fail. That means that a large amount of human labor, which\nmight have been devoted to producing something that could be enjoyed, was\nexpended on producing machines which, when produced, lay idle and did no good\nto anyone. The man who invests his savings in a concern that goes bankrupt is\ntherefore injuring others as well as himself. If he spent his money, say, in\ngiving parties for his friends, they (we may hope) would get pleasure, and so\nwould all those upon whom he spent money, such as the butcher, the baker, and\nthe bootlegger. But if he spends it (let us say) upon laying down rails for\nsurface card in some place where surface cars turn out not to be wanted, he\nhas diverted a mass of labor into channels where it gives pleasure to no one.\nNevertheless, when he becomes poor through failure of his investment he will\nbe regarded as a victim of undeserved misfortune, whereas the gay spendthrift,\nwho has spent his money philanthropically, will be despised as a fool and a\nfrivolous person.\n\nAll this is only preliminary. I want to say, in all seriousness, that a great\ndeal of harm is being done in the modern world by belief in the virtuousness\nof work, and that the road to happiness and prosperity lies in an organized\ndiminution of work.\n\nFirst of all: what is work? Work is of two kinds: first, altering the position\nof matter at or near the earth's surface relatively to other such matter;\nsecond, telling other people to do so. The first kind is unpleasant and ill\npaid; the second is pleasant and highly paid. The second kind is capable of\nindefinite extension: there are not only those who give orders, but those who\ngive advice as to what orders should be given. Usually two opposite kinds of\nadvice are given simultaneously by two organized bodies of men; this is called\npolitics. The skill required for this kind of work is not knowledge of the\nsubjects as to which advice is given, but knowledge of the art of persuasive\nspeaking and writing, i.e. of advertising.\n\nThroughout Europe, though not in America, there is a third class of men, more\nrespected than either of the classes of workers. There are men who, through\nownership of land, are able to make others pay for the privilege of being\nallowed to exist and to work. These landowners are idle, and I might therefore\nbe expected to praise them. Unfortunately, their idleness is only rendered\npossible by the industry of others; indeed their desire for comfortable\nidleness is historically the source of the whole gospel of work. The last\nthing they have ever wished is that others should follow their example.\n\nFrom the beginning of civilization until the Industrial Revolution, a man\ncould, as a rule, produce by hard work little more than was required for the\nsubsistence of himself and his family, although his wife worked at least as\nhard as he did, and his children added their labor as soon as they were old\nenough to do so. The small surplus above bare necessaries was not left to\nthose who produced it, but was appropriated by warriors and priests. In times\nof famine there was no surplus; the warriors and priests, however, still\nsecured as much as at other times, with the result that many of the workers\ndied of hunger. This system persisted in Russia until 1917 [1], and still\npersists in the East; in England, in spite of the Industrial Revolution, it\nremained in full force throughout the Napoleonic wars, and until a hundred\nyears ago, when the new class of manufacturers acquired power. In America, the\nsystem came to an end with the Revolution, except in the South, where it\npersisted until the Civil War. A system which lasted so long and ended so\nrecently has naturally left a profound impress upon men's thoughts and\nopinions. Much that we take for granted about the desirability of work is\nderived from this system, and, being pre-industrial, is not adapted to the\nmodern world. Modern technique has made it possible for leisure, within\nlimits, to be not the prerogative of small privileged classes, but a right\nevenly distributed throughout the community. The morality of work is the\nmorality of slaves, and the modern world has no need of slavery.\n\nIt is obvious that, in primitive communities, peasants, left to themselves,\nwould not have parted with the slender surplus upon which the warriors and\npriests subsisted, but would have either produced less or consumed more. At\nfirst, sheer force compelled them to produce and part with the surplus.\nGradually, however, it was found possible to induce many of them to accept an\nethic according to which it was their duty to work hard, although part of\ntheir work went to support others in idleness. By this means the amount of\ncompulsion required was lessened, and the expenses of government were\ndiminished. To this day, 99 per cent of British wage-earners would be\ngenuinely shocked if it were proposed that the King should not have a larger\nincome than a working man. The conception of duty, speaking historically, has\nbeen a means used by the holders of power to induce others to live for the\ninterests of their masters rather than for their own. Of course the holders of\npower conceal this fact from themselves by managing to believe that their\ninterests are identical with the larger interests of humanity. Sometimes this\nis true; Athenian slave-owners, for instance, employed part of their leisure\nin making a permanent contribution to civilization which would have been\nimpossible under a just economic system. Leisure is essential to civilization,\nand in former times leisure for the few was only rendered possible by the\nlabors of the many. But their labors were valuable, not because work is good,\nbut because leisure is good. And with modern technique it would be possible to\ndistribute leisure justly without injury to civilization.\n\nModern technique has made it possible to diminish enormously the amount of\nlabor required to secure the necessaries of life for everyone. This was made\nobvious during the war. At that time all the men in the armed forces, and all\nthe men and women engaged in the production of munitions, all the men and\nwomen engaged in spying, war propaganda, or Government offices connected with\nthe war, were withdrawn from productive occupations. In spite of this, the\ngeneral level of well-being among unskilled wage-earners on the side of the\nAllies was higher than before or since. The significance of this fact was\nconcealed by finance: borrowing made it appear as if the future was nourishing\nthe present. But that, of course, would have been impossible; a man cannot eat\na loaf of bread that does not yet exist. The war showed conclusively that, by\nthe scientific organization of production, it is possible to keep modern\npopulations in fair comfort on a small part of the working capacity of the\nmodern world. If, at the end of the war, the scientific organization, which\nhad been created in order to liberate men for fighting and munition work, had\nbeen preserved, and the hours of the week had been cut down to four, all would\nhave been well. Instead of that the old chaos was restored, those whose work\nwas demanded were made to work long hours, and the rest were left to starve as\nunemployed. Why? Because work is a duty, and a man should not receive wages in\nproportion to what he has produced, but in proportion to his virtue as\nexemplified by his industry.\n\nThis is the morality of the Slave State, applied in circumstances totally\nunlike those in which it arose. No wonder the result has been disastrous. Let\nus take an illustration. Suppose that, at a given moment, a certain number of\npeople are engaged in the manufacture of pins. They make as many pins as the\nworld needs, working (say) eight hours a day. Someone makes an invention by\nwhich the same number of men can make twice as many pins: pins are already so\ncheap that hardly any more will be bought at a lower price. In a sensible\nworld, everybody concerned in the manufacturing of pins would take to working\nfour hours instead of eight, and everything else would go on as before. But in\nthe actual world this would be thought demoralizing. The men still work eight\nhours, there are too many pins, some employers go bankrupt, and half the men\npreviously concerned in making pins are thrown out of work. There is, in the\nend, just as much leisure as on the other plan, but half the men are totally\nidle while half are still overworked. In this way, it is insured that the\nunavoidable leisure shall cause misery all round instead of being a universal\nsource of happiness. Can anything more insane be imagined?\n\nThe idea that the poor should have leisure has always been shocking to the\nrich. In England, in the early nineteenth century, fifteen hours was the\nordinary day's work for a man; children sometimes did as much, and very\ncommonly did twelve hours a day. When meddlesome busybodies suggested that\nperhaps these hours were rather long, they were told that work kept adults\nfrom drink and children from mischief. When I was a child, shortly after urban\nworking men had acquired the vote, certain public holidays were established by\nlaw, to the great indignation of the upper classes. I remember hearing an old\nDuchess say: 'What do the poor want with holidays? They ought to work.' People\nnowadays are less frank, but the sentiment persists, and is the source of much\nof our economic confusion.\n\nLet us, for a moment, consider the ethics of work frankly, without\nsuperstition. Every human being, of necessity, consumes, in the course of his\nlife, a certain amount of the produce of human labor. Assuming, as we may,\nthat labor is on the whole disagreeable, it is unjust that a man should\nconsume more than he produces. Of course he may provide services rather than\ncommodities, like a medical man, for example; but he should provide something\nin return for his board and lodging. to this extent, the duty of work must be\nadmitted, but to this extent only.\n\nI shall not dwell upon the fact that, in all modern societies outside the\nUSSR, many people escape even this minimum amount of work, namely all those\nwho inherit money and all those who marry money. I do not think the fact that\nthese people are allowed to be idle is nearly so harmful as the fact that\nwage-earners are expected to overwork or starve.\n\nIf the ordinary wage-earner worked four hours a day, there would be enough for\neverybody and no unemployment -- assuming a certain very moderate amount of\nsensible organization. This idea shocks the well-to-do, because they are\nconvinced that the poor would not know how to use so much leisure. In America\nmen often work long hours even when they are well off; such men, naturally,\nare indignant at the idea of leisure for wage-earners, except as the grim\npunishment of unemployment; in fact, they dislike leisure even for their sons.\nOddly enough, while they wish their sons to work so hard as to have no time to\nbe civilized, they do not mind their wives and daughters having no work at\nall. the snobbish admiration of uselessness, which, in an aristocratic\nsociety, extends to both sexes, is, under a plutocracy, confined to women;\nthis, however, does not make it any more in agreement with common sense.\n\nThe wise use of leisure, it must be conceded, is a product of civilization and\neducation. A man who has worked long hours all his life will become bored if\nhe becomes suddenly idle. But without a considerable amount of leisure a man\nis cut off from many of the best things. There is no longer any reason why the\nbulk of the population should suffer this deprivation; only a foolish\nasceticism, usually vicarious, makes us continue to insist on work in\nexcessive quantities now that the need no longer exists.\n\nIn the new creed which controls the government of Russia, while there is much\nthat is very different from the traditional teaching of the West, there are\nsome things that are quite unchanged. The attitude of the governing classes,\nand especially of those who conduct educational propaganda, on the subject of\nthe dignity of labor, is almost exactly that which the governing classes of\nthe world have always preached to what were called the 'honest poor'.\nIndustry, sobriety, willingness to work long hours for distant advantages,\neven submissiveness to authority, all these reappear; moreover authority still\nrepresents the will of the Ruler of the Universe, Who, however, is now called\nby a new name, Dialectical Materialism.\n\nThe victory of the proletariat in Russia has some points in common with the\nvictory of the feminists in some other countries. For ages, men had conceded\nthe superior saintliness of women, and had consoled women for their\ninferiority by maintaining that saintliness is more desirable than power. At\nlast the feminists decided that they would have both, since the pioneers among\nthem believed all that the men had told them about the desirability of virtue,\nbut not what they had told them about the worthlessness of political power. A\nsimilar thing has happened in Russia as regards manual work. For ages, the\nrich and their sycophants have written in praise of 'honest toil', have\npraised the simple life, have professed a religion which teaches that the poor\nare much more likely to go to heaven than the rich, and in general have tried\nto make manual workers believe that there is some special nobility about\naltering the position of matter in space, just as men tried to make women\nbelieve that they derived some special nobility from their sexual enslavement.\nIn Russia, all this teaching about the excellence of manual work has been\ntaken seriously, with the result that the manual worker is more honored than\nanyone else. What are, in essence, revivalist appeals are made, but not for\nthe old purposes: they are made to secure shock workers for special tasks.\nManual work is the ideal which is held before the young, and is the basis of\nall ethical teaching.\n\nFor the present, possibly, this is all to the good. A large country, full of\nnatural resources, awaits development, and has has to be developed with very\nlittle use of credit. In these circumstances, hard work is necessary, and is\nlikely to bring a great reward. But what will happen when the point has been\nreached where everybody could be comfortable without working long hours?\n\nIn the West, we have various ways of dealing with this problem. We have no\nattempt at economic justice, so that a large proportion of the total produce\ngoes to a small minority of the population, many of whom do no work at all.\nOwing to the absence of any central control over production, we produce hosts\nof things that are not wanted. We keep a large percentage of the working\npopulation idle, because we can dispense with their labor by making the others\noverwork. When all these methods prove inadequate, we have a war: we cause a\nnumber of people to manufacture high explosives, and a number of others to\nexplode them, as if we were children who had just discovered fireworks. By a\ncombination of all these devices we manage, though with difficulty, to keep\nalive the notion that a great deal of severe manual work must be the lot of\nthe average man.\n\nIn Russia, owing to more economic justice and central control over production,\nthe problem will have to be differently solved. the rational solution would\nbe, as soon as the necessaries and elementary comforts can be provided for\nall, to reduce the hours of labor gradually, allowing a popular vote to\ndecide, at each stage, whether more leisure or more goods were to be\npreferred. But, having taught the supreme virtue of hard work, it is difficult\nto see how the authorities can aim at a paradise in which there will be much\nleisure and little work. It seems more likely that they will find continually\nfresh schemes, by which present leisure is to be sacrificed to future\nproductivity. I read recently of an ingenious plan put forward by Russian\nengineers, for making the White Sea and the northern coasts of Siberia warm,\nby putting a dam across the Kara Sea. An admirable project, but liable to\npostpone proletarian comfort for a generation, while the nobility of toil is\nbeing displayed amid the ice-fields and snowstorms of the Arctic Ocean. This\nsort of thing, if it happens, will be the result of regarding the virtue of\nhard work as an end in itself, rather than as a means to a state of affairs in\nwhich it is no longer needed.\n\nThe fact is that moving matter about, while a certain amount of it is\nnecessary to our existence, is emphatically not one of the ends of human life.\nIf it were, we should have to consider every navvy superior to Shakespeare. We\nhave been misled in this matter by two causes. One is the necessity of keeping\nthe poor contented, which has led the rich, for thousands of years, to preach\nthe dignity of labor, while taking care themselves to remain undignified in\nthis respect. The other is the new pleasure in mechanism, which makes us\ndelight in the astonishingly clever changes that we can produce on the earth's\nsurface. Neither of these motives makes any great appeal to the actual worker.\nIf you ask him what he thinks the best part of his life, he is not likely to\nsay: 'I enjoy manual work because it makes me feel that I am fulfilling man's\nnoblest task, and because I like to think how much man can transform his\nplanet. It is true that my body demands periods of rest, which I have to fill\nin as best I may, but I am never so happy as when the morning comes and I can\nreturn to the toil from which my contentment springs.' I have never heard\nworking men say this sort of thing. They consider work, as it should be\nconsidered, a necessary means to a livelihood, and it is from their leisure\nthat they derive whatever happiness they may enjoy.\n\nIt will be said that, while a little leisure is pleasant, men would not know\nhow to fill their days if they had only four hours of work out of the twenty-\nfour. In so far as this is true in the modern world, it is a condemnation of\nour civilization; it would not have been true at any earlier period. There was\nformerly a capacity for light-heartedness and play which has been to some\nextent inhibited by the cult of efficiency. The modern man thinks that\neverything ought to be done for the sake of something else, and never for its\nown sake. Serious-minded persons, for example, are continually condemning the\nhabit of going to the cinema, and telling us that it leads the young into\ncrime. But all the work that goes to producing a cinema is respectable,\nbecause it is work, and because it brings a money profit. The notion that the\ndesirable activities are those that bring a profit has made everything topsy-\nturvy. The butcher who provides you with meat and the baker who provides you\nwith bread are praiseworthy, because they are making money; but when you enjoy\nthe food they have provided, you are merely frivolous, unless you eat only to\nget strength for your work. Broadly speaking, it is held that getting money is\ngood and spending money is bad. Seeing that they are two sides of one\ntransaction, this is absurd; one might as well maintain that keys are good,\nbut keyholes are bad. Whatever merit there may be in the production of goods\nmust be entirely derivative from the advantage to be obtained by consuming\nthem. The individual, in our society, works for profit; but the social purpose\nof his work lies in the consumption of what he produces. It is this divorce\nbetween the individual and the social purpose of production that makes it so\ndifficult for men to think clearly in a world in which profit-making is the\nincentive to industry. We think too much of production, and too little of\nconsumption. One result is that we attach too little importance to enjoyment\nand simple happiness, and that we do not judge production by the pleasure that\nit gives to the consumer.\n\nWhen I suggest that working hours should be reduced to four, I am not meaning\nto imply that all the remaining time should necessarily be spent in pure\nfrivolity. I mean that four hours' work a day should entitle a man to the\nnecessities and elementary comforts of life, and that the rest of his time\nshould be his to use as he might see fit. It is an essential part of any such\nsocial system that education should be carried further than it usually is at\npresent, and should aim, in part, at providing tastes which would enable a man\nto use leisure intelligently. I am not thinking mainly of the sort of things\nthat would be considered 'highbrow'. Peasant dances have died out except in\nremote rural areas, but the impulses which caused them to be cultivated must\nstill exist in human nature. The pleasures of urban populations have become\nmainly passive: seeing cinemas, watching football matches, listening to the\nradio, and so on. This results from the fact that their active energies are\nfully taken up with work; if they had more leisure, they would again enjoy\npleasures in which they took an active part.\n\nIn the past, there was a small leisure class and a larger working class. The\nleisure class enjoyed advantages for which there was no basis in social\njustice; this necessarily made it oppressive, limited its sympathies, and\ncaused it to invent theories by which to justify its privileges. These facts\ngreatly diminished its excellence, but in spite of this drawback it\ncontributed nearly the whole of what we call civilization. It cultivated the\narts and discovered the sciences; it wrote the books, invented the\nphilosophies, and refined social relations. Even the liberation of the\noppressed has usually been inaugurated from above. Without the leisure class,\nmankind would never have emerged from barbarism.\n\nThe method of a leisure class without duties was, however, extraordinarily\nwasteful. None of the members of the class had to be taught to be industrious,\nand the class as a whole was not exceptionally intelligent. The class might\nproduce one Darwin, but against him had to be set tens of thousands of country\ngentlemen who never thought of anything more intelligent than fox-hunting and\npunishing poachers. At present, the universities are supposed to provide, in a\nmore systematic way, what the leisure class provided accidentally and as a by-\nproduct. This is a great improvement, but it has certain drawbacks. University\nlife is so different from life in the world at large that men who live in\nacademic milieu tend to be unaware of the preoccupations and problems of\nordinary men and women; moreover their ways of expressing themselves are\nusually such as to rob their opinions of the influence that they ought to have\nupon the general public. Another disadvantage is that in universities studies\nare organized, and the man who thinks of some original line of research is\nlikely to be discouraged. Academic institutions, therefore, useful as they\nare, are not adequate guardians of the interests of civilization in a world\nwhere everyone outside their walls is too busy for unutilitarian pursuits.\n\nIn a world where no one is compelled to work more than four hours a day, every\nperson possessed of scientific curiosity will be able to indulge it, and every\npainter will be able to paint without starving, however excellent his pictures\nmay be. Young writers will not be obliged to draw attention to themselves by\nsensational pot-boilers, with a view to acquiring the economic independence\nneeded for monumental works, for which, when the time at last comes, they will\nhave lost the taste and capacity. Men who, in their professional work, have\nbecome interested in some phase of economics or government, will be able to\ndevelop their ideas without the academic detachment that makes the work of\nuniversity economists often seem lacking in reality. Medical men will have the\ntime to learn about the progress of medicine, teachers will not be\nexasperatedly struggling to teach by routine methods things which they learnt\nin their youth, which may, in the interval, have been proved to be untrue.\n\nAbove all, there will be happiness and joy of life, instead of frayed nerves,\nweariness, and dyspepsia. The work exacted will be enough to make leisure\ndelightful, but not enough to produce exhaustion. Since men will not be tired\nin their spare time, they will not demand only such amusements as are passive\nand vapid. At least one per cent will probably devote the time not spent in\nprofessional work to pursuits of some public importance, and, since they will\nnot depend upon these pursuits for their livelihood, their originality will be\nunhampered, and there will be no need to conform to the standards set by\nelderly pundits. But it is not only in these exceptional cases that the\nadvantages of leisure will appear. Ordinary men and women, having the\nopportunity of a happy life, will become more kindly and less persecuting and\nless inclined to view others with suspicion. The taste for war will die out,\npartly for this reason, and partly because it will involve long and severe\nwork for all. Good nature is, of all moral qualities, the one that the world\nneeds most, and good nature is the result of ease and security, not of a life\nof arduous struggle. Modern methods of production have given us the\npossibility of ease and security for all; we have chosen, instead, to have\noverwork for some and starvation for others. Hitherto we have continued to be\nas energetic as we were before there were machines; in this we have been\nfoolish, but there is no reason to go on being foolish forever.\n\n[1] Since then, members of the Communist Party have succeeded to this\nprivilege of the warriors and priests.\n\n## Files\n\nBertrand Russell - In Praise of Idleness.pdf (60.73 KB)\n\n  * audio\n  * work life\n  * work\n  * Bertrand Russell\n  * PDF\n\n## Comments\n\n## Related content\n\n## How to be idle - Tom Hodgkinson\n\nSleep in, drink in the day and have sex at 1 in the morning, How to be Idle\nargues that we reject work ethic for a life of leisure.\n\n## Stone age economics - Marshall Sahlins\n\nAmbitiously tackling the nature of economic life and how to study it\ncomparatively, Stone Age Economics includes six studies which reflect the...\n\n## The tyranny of the clock - George Woodcock\n\nShort piece on the manufacture of accurate time and how the world became a\nmore structured place, a worser one, overnight.\n\n## The road to Wigan Pier - George Orwell\n\nOrwell's examinations of the conditions for the working class in the north of\nEngland prior to World War Two and how he became a socialist.\n\n## Transnational feminism's radical past: Lessons from Italian immigrant women\nanarchists in industrializing America\n\nAn article by Jennifer Guglielmo on the activism of Italian immigrant\nanarchist...\n\n## We'll let you know when to come back - Kermit Johnson\n\nFirst hand account of Kermit Johnson, rank and file chairman for the strike\ncommittee during the...\n\n", "frontpage": true}
