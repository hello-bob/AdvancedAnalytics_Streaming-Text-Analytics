He had been serving a prison sentence\non charges of extremism, which the international community decried as trumped\nup to try and silence a thorn in the side of the Kremlin. World leaders have\nlined up to condemn the death, while a number of nations \u2013 including the UK\nand the US \u2013 have announced sanctions against those in charge of the prison in\nwhich Mr Navalny was held.\n\nMr Navalny\u2019s wife, Yulia Navalnya, has directly accused Putin of ordering\nNavalny\u2019s killing, which came a month before a sham presidential election that\nhanded Putin another term in power \u2013 extending his more than two-decade iron\ngrip on Russia.\n\nBut, according to The Wall Street Journal, US intelligence services believe\nPutin most likely did not choose for the killing to be carried out or the date\non which it took place.\n\nWhile the findings by US intelligence agencies did not \u201cdispute Putin\u2019s\nculpability\u201d for his rival\u2019s death \u2013 given the conditions Mr Navalny was being\nheld in and the constant harassment he had faced \u2013 the report said it is\nbelieved that he \u201cprobably did not order it at that moment\u201d.\n\nThese findings have been accepted within the intelligence community and shared\nacross several wings of intelligence in Washington, including the Central\nIntelligence Agency, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and\nthe State Department\u2019s intelligence unit, the WSJ reported, citing people\naware of the matter.\n\nNavalny, who was repeatedly targeted by the Kremlin and Russian authorities\nfor years, was moved in December from his former prison in the Vladimir region\nof central Russia to a \u201cspecial regime\u201d penal colony in the Arctic Circle \u2013\nthe highest security level for prisons in Russia.\n\nA Navalny aide, Leonid Volkov, rejected the findings in the WSJ report as\n\u201cnaive and ridiculous\u201d.\n\nWashington\u2019s assessment was reportedly based on a range of information,\nincluding some classified intelligence as well as publicly known facts, such\nas the timing of Navalny\u2019s death and how it overshadowed Russia\u2019s sham\npresidential election.\n\nOfficials in the Kremlin have rejected allegations of state involvement in Mr\nNavalny\u2019s death. Having not spoken his harshest critic\u2019s name for years, Putin\nhimself eventually described the death as \u201csad\u201d and claimed he was ready to\nhand the jailed politician over to the West in a prisoner exchange provided\nNavalny never return to Russia. Observers may be sceptical about Putin\u2019s\nwords, given how the Kremlin dealt with Mr Navalny over the years.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has responded to the WSJ report, calling\nthe US intelligence findings \u201cempty speculation\u201d.\n\n\"I\u2019ve seen the material, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s high-quality material that\ndeserves attention,\" he said.\n\n## Join our commenting forum\n\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see\ntheir replies\n\nComments\n\n### 1/1US intelligence believes \u2018Putin probably didn\u2019t order Navalny killing\u2019\n\n### US intelligence believes \u2018Putin probably didn\u2019t order Navalny killing\u2019\n\nA protester holds a sign showing late Kremlin opposition leader Alexei Navalny\nand reading \u2018I\u2019ll be back\u2019, during a protest in Riga\n\nGetty\n\n### Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference\nlater?
