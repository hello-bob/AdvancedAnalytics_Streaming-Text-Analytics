The ground team sent a command up to Voyager 1 on\nThursday to recode part of the memory of the spacecraft's Flight Data\nSubsystem (FDS), one of the probe's three computers.\n\n\u201cIn the minutes leading up to when we were going to see a signal, you could\nhave heard a pin drop in the room,\" said Linda Spilker, project scientist for\nNASA's two Voyager spacecraft at JPL. \"It was quiet. People were looking very\nserious. They were looking at their computer screens. Each of the subsystem\n(engineers) had pages up that they were looking at, to watch as they would be\npopulated.\"\n\n## Finally, a breakthrough\n\nLaunched nearly 47 years ago, Voyager 1 is flying on an outbound trajectory\nmore than 15 billion miles (24 billion kilometers) from Earth, and it takes\n22-and-a-half hours for a radio signal to cover that distance at the speed of\nlight. This means it takes nearly two days for engineers to uplink a command\nto Voyager 1 and get a response.\n\nIn November, Voyager 1 suddenly stopped transmitting its usual stream of data\ncontaining information about the spacecraft's health and measurements from its\nscientific instruments. Instead, the spacecraft's data stream was entirely\nunintelligible. Because the telemetry was unreadable, experts on the ground\ncould not easily tell what went wrong. They hypothesized the source of the\nproblem might be in the memory bank of the FDS.\n\nThere was a breakthrough last month when engineers sent up a novel command to\n\"poke\" Voyager 1's FDS to send back a readout of its memory. This readout\nallowed engineers to pinpoint the location of the problem in the FDS memory.\nThe FDS is responsible for packaging engineering and scientific data for\ntransmission to Earth.\n\nAfter a few weeks, NASA was ready to uplink a solution to get the FDS to\nresume packing engineering data. This data stream includes information on the\nstatus of the spacecraft\u2014things like power levels and temperature\nmeasurements. This command went up to Voyager 1 through one of NASA's large\nDeep Space Network antennas Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, the wait for a response. Spilker, who started working on Voyager right\nout of college in 1977, was in the room when Voyager 1's signal reached Earth\nSaturday.\n\n\"When the time came to get the signal, we could clearly see all of a sudden,\nboom, we had data, and there were tears and smiles and high fives,\" she told\nArs. \"Everyone was very happy and very excited to see that, hey, we're back in\ncommunication again with Voyager 1. We're going to see the status of the\nspacecraft, the health of the spacecraft, for the first time in five months.\"\n\nEnlarge / Voyager 1's team celebrates the arrival of a radio signal from the\nspacecraft Saturday.\n\nNASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nThroughout the five months of troubleshooting, Voyager's ground team continued\nto receive signals indicating the spacecraft was still alive. But until\nSaturday, they lacked insight into specific details about the status of\nVoyager 1.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much just the way we left it,\" Spilker said. \"We're still in the\ninitial phases of analyzing all of the channels and looking at their trends.\nSome of the temperatures went down a little bit with this period of time\nthat's gone on, but we're pretty much seeing everything we had hoped for. And\nthat's always good news.\u201d\n\n## Relocating code\n\nThrough their investigation, Voyager's ground team discovered a single chip\nresponsible for storing a portion of the FDS memory stopped working, probably\ndue to either a cosmic ray hit or a failure of aging hardware. This affected\nsome of the computer's software code.\n\n\"That took out a section of memory,\" Spilker said. \"What they have to do is\nrelocate that code into a different portion of the memory, and then make sure\nthat anything that uses those codes, those subroutines, know to go to the new\nlocation of memory, for access and to run it.\"\n\nOnly about 3 percent of the FDS memory was corrupted by the bad chip, so\nengineers needed to transplant that code into another part of the memory bank.\nBut no single location is large enough to hold the section of code in its\nentirety, NASA said.\n\nSo the Voyager team divided the code into sections for storage in different\nplaces in the FDS. This wasn't just a copy-and-paste job. Engineers needed to\nmodify some of the code to make sure it will all work together. \"Any\nreferences to the location of that code in other parts of the FDS memory\nneeded to be updated as well,\" NASA said in a statement.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n107\n\nStephen Clark Stephen Clark is a space reporter at Ars Technica, covering\nprivate space companies and the world\u2019s space agencies.
