There is always at least one constraint, and TOC\nuses a focusing process to identify the constraint and restructure the rest of\nthe organization around it. TOC adopts the common idiom \"a chain is no\nstronger than its weakest link\". That means that organizations and processes\nare vulnerable because the weakest person or part can always damage or break\nthem, or at least adversely affect the outcome.\n\n## History[edit]\n\nThe theory of constraints (TOC) is an overall management philosophy,\nintroduced by Eliyahu M. Goldratt in his 1984 book titled The Goal, that is\ngeared to help organizations continually achieve their goals.^[1] Goldratt\nadapted the concept to project management with his book Critical Chain,\npublished in 1997.\n\nAn earlier propagator of a similar concept was Wolfgang Mewes^[2] in Germany\nwith publications on power-oriented management theory (Machtorientierte\nF\u00fchrungstheorie, 1963) and following with his Energo-Kybernetic System (EKS,\n1971), later renamed Engpasskonzentrierte Strategie (Bottleneck-focused\nStrategy) as a more advanced theory of bottlenecks. The publications of\nWolfgang Mewes are marketed through the FAZ Verlag, publishing house of the\nGerman newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. However, the paradigm Theory\nof constraints was first used by Goldratt.\n\n### Key assumption[edit]\n\nThe underlying premise of the theory of constraints is that organizations can\nbe measured and controlled by variations on three measures: throughput,\noperational expense, and inventory. Inventory is all the money that the system\nhas invested in purchasing things which it intends to sell. Operational\nexpense is all the money the system spends in order to turn inventory into\nthroughput. Throughput is the rate at which the system generates money through\nsales.^[3]\n\nBefore the goal itself can be reached, necessary conditions must first be met.\nThese typically include safety, quality, legal obligations, etc. For most\nbusinesses, the goal itself is to make profit. However, for many organizations\nand non-profit businesses, making money is a necessary condition for pursuing\nthe goal. Whether it is the goal or a necessary condition, understanding how\nto make sound financial decisions based on throughput, inventory, and\noperating expense is a critical requirement.^[3]\n\n### The five focusing steps[edit]\n\nTheory of constraints is based on the premise that the rate of goal\nachievement by a goal-oriented system (i.e., the system's throughput) is\nlimited by at least one constraint.\n\nThe argument by reductio ad absurdum is as follows: If there was nothing\npreventing a system from achieving higher throughput (i.e., more goal units in\na unit of time), its throughput would be infinite \u2013 which is impossible in a\nreal-life system.\n\nOnly by increasing flow through the constraint can overall throughput be\nincreased.^[1]\n\nAssuming the goal of a system has been articulated and its measurements\ndefined, the steps are:\n\n  1. Identify the system's constraint(s).\n  2. Decide how to exploit the system's constraint(s).\n  3. Subordinate everything else to the above decision.\n  4. Elevate the system's constraint(s).\n  5. Warning! If in the previous steps a constraint has been broken, go back to step 1, but do not allow inertia to cause a system's constraint.^[4]\n\nThe goal of a commercial organization is: \"Make more money now and in the\nfuture\",^[5] and its measurements are given by throughput accounting as:\nthroughput, inventory, and operating expenses.\n\nThe five focusing steps aim to ensure ongoing improvement efforts are centered\non the organization's constraint(s). In the TOC literature, this is referred\nto as the process of ongoing improvement (POOGI).\n\nThese focusing steps are the key steps to developing the specific applications\nmentioned below.\n\n### Constraints[edit]\n\nA constraint is anything that prevents the system from achieving its goal.\nThere are many ways that constraints can show up, but a core principle within\nTOC is that there are not tens or hundreds of constraints. There is at least\none, but at most only a few in any given system. Constraints can be internal\nor external to the system. An internal constraint is in evidence when the\nmarket demands more from the system than it can deliver. If this is the case,\nthen the focus of the organization should be on discovering that constraint\nand following the five focusing steps to open it up (and potentially remove\nit). An external constraint exists when the system can produce more than the\nmarket will bear. If this is the case, then the organization should focus on\nmechanisms to create more demand for its products or services.\n\nTypes of (internal) constraints\n\n  * Equipment: The way equipment is currently used limits the ability of the system to produce more salable goods/services.\n  * People: Lack of skilled people limits the system. Mental models held by people can cause behaviour that becomes a constraint.\n  * Policy: A written or unwritten policy prevents the system from making more.\n\nThe concept of the constraint in Theory of Constraints is analogous to but\ndiffers from the constraint that shows up in mathematical optimization. In\nTOC, the constraint is used as a focusing mechanism for management of the\nsystem. In optimization, the constraint is written into the mathematical\nexpressions to limit the scope of the solution (X can be no greater than 5).\n\nPlease note: organizations have many problems with equipment, people,\npolicies, etc. (A breakdown is just that \u2013 a breakdown \u2013 and is not a\nconstraint in the true sense of the TOC concept). The constraint is the\nlimiting factor that is preventing the organization from getting more\nthroughput (typically, revenue through sales) even when nothing goes wrong.\n\n### Breaking a constraint[edit]\n\nIf a constraint's throughput capacity is elevated to the point where it is no\nlonger the system's limiting factor, this is said to \"break\" the constraint.\nThe limiting factor is now some other part of the system, or may be external\nto the system (an external constraint). This is not to be confused with a\nbreakdown.\n\n### Buffers[edit]\n\nBuffers are used throughout the theory of constraints. They often result as\npart of the exploit and subordinate steps of the five focusing steps. Buffers\nare placed before the governing constraint, thus ensuring that the constraint\nis never starved. Buffers are also placed behind the constraint to prevent\ndownstream failure from blocking the constraint's output. Buffers used in this\nway protect the constraint from variations in the rest of the system and\nshould allow for normal variation of processing time and the occasional upset\n(Murphy) before and behind the constraint.\n\nBuffers can be a bank of physical objects before a work center, waiting to be\nprocessed by that work center. Buffers ultimately buy you time, as in the time\nbefore work reaches the constraint and are often verbalized as time buffers.\nThere should always be enough (but not excessive) work in the time queue\nbefore the constraint and adequate offloading space behind the constraint.\n\nBuffers are not the small queue of work that sits before every work center in\na kanban system although it is similar if you regard the assembly line as the\ngoverning constraint. A prerequisite in the theory is that with one constraint\nin the system, all other parts of the system must have sufficient capacity to\nkeep up with the work at the constraint and to catch up if time was lost. In a\nbalanced line, as espoused by kanban, when one work center goes down for a\nperiod longer than the buffer allows, then the entire system must wait until\nthat work center is restored. In a TOC system, the only situation where work\nis in danger is if the constraint is unable to process (either due to\nmalfunction, sickness or a \"hole\" in the buffer \u2013 if something goes wrong that\nthe time buffer can not protect).\n\nBuffer management, therefore, represents a crucial attribute of the theory of\nconstraints. There are many ways to apply buffers, but the most often used is\na visual system of designating the buffer in three colors: green (okay),\nyellow (caution) and red (action required). Creating this kind of visibility\nenables the system as a whole to align and thus subordinate to the need of the\nconstraint in a holistic manner. This can also be done daily in a central\noperations room that is accessible to everybody.\n\n### Plant types[edit]\n\nThere are four primary types of plants in the TOC lexicon. Draw the flow of\nmaterial from the bottom of a page to the top, and you get the four types.\nThey specify the general flow of materials through a system, and also provide\nsome hints about where to look for typical problems. This type of analysis is\nknown as VATI analysis^[6] as it uses the bottom-up shapes of the letters V,\nA, T, and I to describe the types of plants. The four types can be combined in\nmany ways in larger facilities, e.g. \"an A plant feeding a V plant\".\n\n  * V-plant: The general flow of material is one-to-many, such as a plant that takes one raw material and can make many final products. Classic examples are meat rendering plants or a steel manufacturer. The primary problem in V-plants is \"robbing,\" where one operation (A) immediately after a diverging point \"steals\" materials meant for the other operation (B). Once the material has been processed by A, it cannot come back and be run through B without significant rework.\n  * A-plant: The general flow of material is many-to-one, such as in a plant where many sub-assemblies converge for a final assembly. The primary problem in A-plants is in synchronizing the converging lines so that each supplies the final assembly point at the right time.\n  * T-plant: The general flow is that of an I-plant (or has multiple lines), which then splits into many assemblies (many-to-many). Most manufactured parts are used in multiple assemblies and nearly all assemblies use multiple parts. Customized devices, such as computers, are good examples. T-plants suffer from both synchronization problems of A-plants (parts aren't all available for an assembly) and the robbing problems of V-plants (one assembly steals parts that could have been used in another).\n  * I-plant: Material flows in a sequence, such as in an assembly line. The primary work is done in a straight sequence of events (one-to-one). The constraint is the slowest operation.\n\nFrom the above list, one can deduce that for non-material systems one could\ndraw the flow of work or the flow of processes, instead of physical flows, and\narrive at similar basic V, A, T, or I structures. A project, for example, is\nan A-shaped sequence of work, culminating in a delivered product (i.e., the\nintended outcome of the project).\n\n## Applications[edit]\n\nThe focusing steps, this process of ongoing improvement, have been applied to\nmanufacturing, project management, supply chain/distribution generated\nspecific solutions. Other tools (mainly the \"thinking process\") also led to\nTOC applications in the fields of marketing and sales, and finance. The\nsolution as applied to each of these areas are listed below.\n\n### Operations[edit]\n\nWithin manufacturing operations and operations management, the solution seeks\nto pull materials through the system, rather than push them into the system.\nThe primary methodology used is drum-buffer-rope (DBR)^[7] and a variation\ncalled simplified drum-buffer-rope (S-DBR).^[8]\n\nDrum-buffer-rope is a manufacturing execution methodology based on the fact\nthe output of a system can only be the same as the output at the constraint of\nthe system. Any attempt to produce more than what the constraint can process\njust leads to excess inventory piling up.^[9] The method is named for its\nthree components. The drum is the rate at which the physical constraint of the\nplant can work: the work center or machine or operation that limits the\nability of the entire system to produce more. The rest of the plant follows\nthe beat of the drum. Schedule at the drum decides what the system should\nproduce, in what sequence to produce and how much to produce.^[10] They make\nsure the drum has work and that anything the drum has processed does not get\nwasted.\n\nThe buffer protects the drum, so that it always has work flowing to it.\nBuffers in DBR provide the additional lead time beyond the required set up and\nprocess times, for materials in the product flow. Since these buffers have\ntime as their unit of measure, rather than quantity of material, this makes\nthe priority system operate strictly based on the time an order is expected to\nbe at the drum. Each work order will have a remaining buffer status that can\nbe calculated. Based on this buffer status, work orders can be color coded\ninto Red, Yellow and Green. The red orders have the highest priority and must\nbe worked on first, since they have penetrated most into their buffers\nfollowed by yellow and green. As time evolves, this buffer status might change\nand the color assigned to the particular work order change with it.^[11]^[12]\n\nTraditional DBR usually calls for buffers at several points in the system: the\nconstraint, synchronization points and at shipping. S-DBR has a buffer at\nshipping and manages the flow of work across the drum through a load planning\nmechanism.^[13]\n\nThe rope is the work release mechanism for the plant. Orders are released to\nthe shop floor at one \"buffer time\" before they are due to be processed by the\nconstraint. In other words, if the buffer is 5 days, the order is released 5\ndays before it is due at the constraint. Putting work into the system earlier\nthan this buffer time is likely to generate too-high work-in-process and slow\ndown the entire system.^[14]\n\n### High-speed automated production lines[edit]\n\nAutomated production lines achieve high throughput rates and output quantities\nby deploying automation solutions that are highly task-specific. Depending on\ntheir design and construction, these machines operate at different speeds and\ncapacities and therefore have varying efficiency levels.\n\nA prominent example is the use of automated production lines in the beverage\nindustry. Filling systems usually have several machines executing parts of the\ncomplete bottling process, from filling primary containers to secondary\npackaging and palletisation.^[15]\n\nTo be able to maximize the throughput, the production line usually has a\ndesigned constraint. This constraint is typically the slowest and often the\nmost expensive machine on the line. The overall throughput of the line is\ndetermined by this machine. All other machines can operate faster and are\nconnected by conveyors.\n\nThe conveyors usually have the ability to buffer product. In the event of a\nstoppage at a machine other than the constraint, the conveyor can buffer the\nproduct enabling the constraint machine to keep on running.\n\nA typical line setup is such that in normal operation the upstream conveyors\nfrom the constraint machine are always run full to prevent starvation at the\nconstraint and the downstream conveyors are run empty to prevent a back up at\nthe constraint. The overall aim is to prevent minor stoppages at the machines\nfrom impacting the constraint.\n\nFor this reason as the machines get further from the constraint, they have the\nability to run faster than the previous machine and this creates a V\ncurve.^[citation needed]\n\n### Supply chain and logistics[edit]\n\nIn general, the solution for supply chains is to create flow of inventory so\nas to ensure greater availability and to eliminate surpluses.\n\nThe TOC distribution solution is effective when used to address a single link\nin the supply chain and more so across the entire system, even if that system\ncomprises many different companies. The purpose of the TOC distribution\nsolution is to establish a competitive advantage based on extraordinary\navailability by reducing the damages caused when the flow of goods is\ninterrupted by shortages and surpluses.\n\nThis approach uses several new rules to protect availability with less\ninventory than is conventionally required.\n\n  1. Inventory is held at an aggregation point(s) as close as possible to the source. This approach ensures smoothed demand at the aggregation point, requiring proportionally less inventory. The distribution centers holding the aggregated stock are able to ship goods downstream to the next link in the supply chain much more quickly than a make-to-order manufacturer can.\n  2. Following this rule may result in a make-to-order manufacturer converting to make-to-stock. The inventory added at the aggregation point is significantly less than the inventory reduction downstream.\n  3. In all stocking locations, initial inventory buffers are set which effectively create an upper limit of the inventory at that location. The buffer size is equal to the maximum expected consumption within the average Replenishment Time (\"RT\"), plus additional stock to protect in case a delivery is late. In other words, there is no advantage in holding more inventory in a location than the amount that might be consumed before more could be ordered and received. Typically, the sum of the on hand value of such buffers are 25\u201375% less than currently observed average inventory levels\n\n    1. Replenishment Time (RT) is the sum of the delay, after the first consumption following a delivery, before an order is placed plus the delay after the order is placed until the ordered goods arrive at the ordering location.\n  4. Once buffers have been established, no replenishment orders are placed as long as the quantity inbound (already ordered but not yet received) plus the quantity on hand are equal to or greater than the buffer size. Following this rule causes surplus inventory to be bled off as it is consumed.\n  5. For any reason, when on hand plus inbound inventory is less than the buffer, orders are placed as soon as practical to increase the inbound inventory so that the relationship on Hand + Inbound = Buffer is maintained.\n  6. To ensure buffers remain correctly sized even with changes in the rates of demand and replenishment, a simple recursive algorithm called Buffer Management is used. When the on hand inventory level is in the upper third of the buffer for a full RT, the buffer is reduced by one third (and don't forget rule 3). Alternatively, when the on hand inventory is in the bottom one third of the buffer for too long, the buffer is increased by one third (and don't forget rule 4). The definition of \"too long\" may be changed depending on required service levels, however, a rule of thumb is 20% of the RT. Moving buffers up more readily than down is supported by the usually greater damage caused by shortages as compared to the damage caused by surpluses.\n\nOnce inventory is managed as described above, continuous efforts should be\nundertaken to reduce RT, late deliveries, supplier minimum order quantities\n(both per SKU and per order) and customer order batching. Any improvements in\nthese areas will automatically improve both availability and inventory turns,\nthanks to the adaptive nature of Buffer Management.\n\nA stocking location that manages inventory according to the TOC should help a\nnon-TOC customer (downstream link in a supply chain, whether internal or\nexternal) manage their inventory according to the TOC process. This type of\nhelp can take the form of a vendor managed inventory (VMI). The TOC\ndistribution link simply extends its buffer sizing and management techniques\nto its customers' inventories. Doing so has the effect of smoothing the demand\nfrom the customer and reducing order sizes per SKU. VMI results in better\navailability and inventory turns for both supplier and customer. The benefits\nto the non-TOC customers are sufficient to meet the purpose of capitalizing on\nthe competitive edge by giving the customer a reason to be more loyal and give\nmore business to the upstream link. When the end consumers buy more, the whole\nsupply chain sells more.\n\nOne caveat should be considered. Initially and only temporarily, the supply\nchain or a specific link may sell less as the surplus inventory in the system\nis sold. However, the sales lift due to improved availability is a\ncountervailing factor. The current levels of surpluses and shortages make each\ncase different.\n\n### Finance and accounting[edit]\n\nHolistic thinking applied to the finance application has been termed\nthroughput accounting.^[16] Throughput accounting suggests that one examine\nthe impact of investments and operational changes in terms of the impact on\nthe throughput of the business. It is an alternative to cost accounting.\n\nThe primary measures for a TOC view of finance and accounting are: throughput,\noperating expense and investment. Throughput is calculated from sales minus\n\"totally variable cost\", where totally variable cost is usually calculated as\nthe cost of raw materials that go into creating the item sold.^[17]^: 13\u201314\n\n### Project management[edit]\n\nCritical Chain Project Management (CCPM) are utilized in this area.^[18] CCPM\nis based on the idea that all projects look like A-plants: all activities\nconverge to a final deliverable. As such, to protect the project, there must\nbe internal buffers to protect synchronization points and a final project\nbuffer to protect the overall project.\n\n### Marketing and sales[edit]\n\nWhile originally focused on manufacturing and logistics, TOC has expanded into\nsales management and marketing. Its role is explicitly acknowledged in the\nfield of sales process engineering.^[19] For effective sales management one\ncan apply Drum Buffer Rope to the sales process similar to the way it is\napplied to operations (see Reengineering the Sales Process book reference\nbelow). This technique is appropriate when your constraint is in the sales\nprocess itself, or if you just want an effective sales management technique\nwhich includes the topics of funnel management and conversion rates.^[citation\nneeded]\n\n## Thinking processes[edit]\n\nMain article: Thinking processes (theory of constraints)\n\nThe thinking processes are a set of tools to help managers walk through the\nsteps of initiating and implementing a project. When used in a logical flow,\nthey help walk through a buy-in process:\n\n  1. Gain agreement on the problem\n  2. Gain agreement on the direction for a solution\n  3. Gain agreement that the solution solves the problem\n  4. Agree to overcome any potential negative ramifications\n  5. Agree to overcome any obstacles to implementation\n\nTOC practitioners sometimes refer to these in the negative as working through\nlayers of resistance to a change.\n\nRecently, the current reality tree (CRT) and future reality tree (FRT) have\nbeen applied to an argumentative academic paper.^[20]\n\nDespite its origins as a manufacturing approach (Goldratt & Cox, The Goal: A\nprocess of Ongoing Improvement, 1992), Goldratt's Theory of Constraints (TOC)\nmethodology is now regarded as a systems methodology with strong foundations\nin the hard sciences (Mabin, 1999). Through its tools for convergent thinking\nand synthesis, the \"Thinking processes\", which underpin the entire TOC\nmethodology, help identify and manage constraints and guide continuous\nimprovement and change in organizations (Dettmer H. , 1998).\n\nThe process of change requires the identification and acceptance of core\nissues; the goal and the means to the goal. This comprehensive set of logical\ntools can be used for exploration, solution development and solution\nimplementation for individuals, groups or organizations. Each tool has a\npurpose and nearly all tools can be used independently (Cox & Spencer, 1998).\nSince these thinking tools are designed to address successive \"layers of\nresistance\" and enable communication, it expedites securing \"buy in\" of\ngroups. While CRT (current reality tree) represents the undesirable effects of\nthe current situation, the FRT (the future reality tree), NBR (negative\nbranch) help people plan and understand the possible results of their actions.\nThe PRT (prerequisite tree) and TRT (transition tree) are designed to build\ncollective buy in and aid in the Implementation phase. The logical constructs\nof these tools or diagrams are the necessary condition logic, the sufficient\ncause logic and the strict logic rules that are used to validate cause-effect\nrelationships which are modelled with these tools (Dettmer W. , 2006).\n\nA summary of these tools, the questions they help answer and the associated\nlogical constructs used is presented in the table below.\n\nSufficient thinking\"If....... then\"| Necessary Thinking\"In order to...we must\"  \n---|---  \nWhat to change?| Current reality tree  \nWhat to change to?| Future Reality TreeNegative Branch Reservations|\nEvaporating cloud  \nHow to change?| Transition Tree| Prerequisite Tree  \n  \nTOC Thinking Process Tools: Use of these tools are based on the fundamental\nbeliefs of TOC that organizations a) are inherently simple (interdependencies\nexist in organizations) b) desire inherent harmony (win \u2013 win solutions are\npossible) c) are inherently good (people are good) and have inherent potential\n(people and organizations have potential to do better) (Goldratt E. , 2009).\nIn the book \"Through the clouds to solutions\" Jelena Fedurko (Fedurko, 2013)\nstates that the major areas for application of TP tools as:\n\n  * To create and enhance thinking and learning skills\n  * To make better decisions\n  * To develop responsibility for one's own actions through understanding their consequences\n  * To handle conflicts with more confidence and win-win outcomes\n  * To correct behavior with undesirable consequences\n  * Assist in evaluating conditions for achieving a desired outcome\n  * To assist in peer mediation\n  * To assist in relationship between subordinates and bosses^[citation needed]\n\n## Development and practice[edit]\n\nTOC was initiated by Goldratt, who until his death was still the main driving\nforce behind the development and practice of TOC. There is a network of\nindividuals and small companies loosely coupled as practitioners around the\nworld. TOC is sometimes referred to as \"constraint management\". TOC is a large\nbody of knowledge with a strong guiding philosophy of growth.\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\nCriticisms that have been leveled against TOC include:\n\n### Claimed suboptimality of drum-buffer-rope[edit]\n\nWhile TOC has been compared favorably to linear programming techniques,^[21]\nD. Trietsch from University of Auckland argues that DBR methodology is\ninferior to competing methodologies.^[22]^[23] Linhares, from the Getulio\nVargas Foundation, has shown that the TOC approach to establishing an optimal\nproduct mix is unlikely to yield optimum results, as it would imply that\nP=NP.^[24]\n\n### Unacknowledged debt[edit]\n\nDuncan (as cited by Steyn)^[25] says that TOC borrows heavily from systems\ndynamics developed by Forrester in the 1950s and from statistical process\ncontrol which dates back to World War II. And Noreen Smith and Mackey, in\ntheir independent report on TOC, point out that several key concepts in TOC\n\"have been topics in management accounting textbooks for decades.\"^[17]^: 149\nIt is also claimed^[citation needed] that Goldratt's books fail to acknowledge\nthat TOC borrows from more than 40 years of previous management science\nresearch and practice, particularly from program evaluation and review\ntechnique/critical path method (PERT/CPM) and the just in time strategy.\n\nA rebuttal to these criticisms is offered in Goldratt's \"What is the Theory of\nConstraints and How Should it be Implemented?\", and in his audio program,\n\"Beyond The Goal\". In these, Goldratt discusses the history of disciplinary\nsciences, compares the strengths and weaknesses of the various disciplines,\nand acknowledges the sources of information and inspiration for the thinking\nprocesses and critical chain methodologies. Articles published in the now-\ndefunct Journal of Theory of Constraints referenced foundational materials.\nGoldratt published an article^[26] and gave talks^[27] with the title\n\"Standing on the Shoulders of Giants\" in which he gives credit for many of the\ncore ideas of Theory of Constraints. Goldratt has sought many times to show\nthe correlation between various improvement methods.\n\nGoldratt has been criticized on lack of openness in his theories, an example\nbeing him not releasing the algorithm he used for the Optimum Performance\nTraining system.^[28] Some view him as unscientific with many of his theories,\ntools and techniques not being a part of the public domain, rather a part of\nhis own framework of profiting on his ideas. According to Gupta and Snyder\n(2009), despite being recognized as a genuine management philosophy nowadays,\nTOC has yet failed to demonstrate its effectiveness in the academic literature\nand as such, cannot be considered academically worthy to be called a widely\nrecognized theory. TOC needs more case studies that prove a connection between\nimplementation and improved financial performance.^[29] Nave (2002) argues\nthat TOC does not take employees into account and fails to empower them in the\nproduction process. He also states that TOC fails to address unsuccessful\npolicies as constraints.^[30] In contrast, Mukherjee and Chatterjee (2007)\nstate that much of the criticism of Goldratt's work has been focused on the\nlack of rigour in his work, but not of the bottleneck approach, which are two\ndifferent aspects of the issue.^[31]\n\n## Certification and education[edit]\n\nThe Theory of Constraints International Certification Organization (TOCICO) is\nan independent not-for-profit incorporated society that sets exams to ensure a\nconsistent standard of competence. It is overseen by a board^[32]^[non-primary\nsource needed] of academic and industrial experts. It also hosts an annual\ninternational conference. The work presented at these conferences constitutes\na core repository of the current knowledge.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Linear programming\n  * List of Theory of Constraints topics\n  * Industrial engineering\n  * Limiting factor\n  * Systems thinking \u2013 Critical systems thinking \u2013 Joint decision traps\n  * Twelve leverage points by Donella Meadows\n  * Constraint (disambiguation)\n  * Thinklets\n  * Throughput\n  * Rate-determining step\n  * Liebig's law of the minimum\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Cox, Jeff; Goldratt, Eliyahu M.
