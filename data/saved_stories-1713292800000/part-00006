Some experts believe it could help lead to big gains in\nthe digital currency.\n\nDan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nA big event is about to happen in the world of bitcoin: It's called the\nhalving \u2014 and some experts believe it will turbocharge a rally in the digital\ncurrency.\n\n### Business\n\n### Bitcoin hits a record high. Here are 4 things to know about this\nspectacular rally\n\nIn broad terms, the halving effectively reduces the supply of new bitcoins.\nAnd that presumably should lead to higher prices. It's the scarcity principle.\nThe fewer bitcoins that get mined, the more valuable bitcoin becomes.\n\nBut will it? And what does all of this mean? Here's what to know as the big\nday approaches.\n\n### What is the halving?\n\nFirst the name. Few in the crypto world seems to like the name halving.\n\nBut it effectively describes what's going to happen.\n\nAnd it all involves bitcoin mining.\n\nJust like geological miners \u2014 from professionals to amateurs \u2014 who mine the\nearth to discover new diamonds or gold, bitcoin miners must discover something\nhidden. They solve very complicated math formulas to unveil new bitcoins. (Or\nin crypto lingo, \"a block\" is created and then added to a virtual public\nbitcoin ledger called the blockchain)\n\nWhoever solves the formula first gets a bunch of bitcoins as a prize. It's why\nminers try to compete in this race by building the most powerful computer\nnetworks they can.\n\nA 'Buy Bitcoin Here' sign is posted at a 7-Eleven store in Los Angeles on Nov.\n10, 2021. How much the halving contributes to gains in bitcoin has been a\nsubject of continued debate.

How much the halving contributes to gains in bitcoin has been a\nsubject of continued debate.\n\nMario Tama/Getty Images\n\nBut the reward of bitcoin that miners get by finding the solution periodically\ngets cut in half. This formula was deliberately built into the computational\ncode that makes up bitcoin.\n\nAlso deliberately built into the system is the number of bitcoins that can\never exist \u2014 the supply is capped at 21 million. So far roughly 19 million\ntokens have been created.\n\nAnd every time 210,000 formulas (or blocks) get solved, a halving occurs.\n\nThe halving effectively increases the time it will take to reach that 21\nmillion limit \u2014 and it also tends to increase bitcoin's value.\n\nThe halving has happened roughly every four years, and the next one is\nexpected to happen sometime around April 19 or 20, although that may shift. So\nfar, the halving has occurred three times.\n\nWhen bitcoin was first created, miners got a stash of 50 tokens when they\nsolved the formula.\n\nThat was cut to 25 in the first halving in 2012. Then to 12.5 in 2016. And\nsince 2020, it stands at 6.25 tokens.\n\nAnd when the next halving happens in a few days, miners will only get 3.125\ntokens.\n\n### Will the halving spark a rally in bitcoin?\n\nSo far it has.\n\nIn each of the three previous halvings, bitcoin went on to rally by three-\ndigit percentage points in the year that followed.\n\nBut whether the halving itself was the main cause has been a subject of\ndebate.\n\nThis debate continues as the next halving looms. Bitcoin has already rallied\nin the lead-up to the upcoming halving, hitting a record high last month of\nabove $70,000.\n\nSome experts argue that there are other factors that will push up the price of\nbitcoin this time around, halving or no halving. The fact there is an\nincreasing adoption of bitcoin, for example. And that traders are speculating\nmore on bitcoin.\n\n### Business\n\n### Sam Bankman-Fried sentenced to 25 years in prison for his FTX crimes\n\nAlso, big investment firms such as BlackRock this year launched spot bitcoin\nexchange-traded funds (ETFs) \u2014 or funds that track the price of bitcoin. That\nhas also led to increased demand for the digital currency.\n\nBlackRock unveiled its Bitcoin Spot ETF on the Nasdaq Exchange on Jan. 11,\n2024 in New York City. The launch of these types of ETFs are driving up demand\nfor bitcoin.

Others argue that halvings also force miners to get\nmore efficient because the energy needed to power all those computers is\nexpensive. For example, miners may use more renewable energy or they'll turn\nto computers that can do more with less power.\n\nA technician inspects the backside of bitcoin mining at Bitfarms in Saint\nHyacinthe, Quebec, Canada on March 19, 2018.

There's also considerable debate\nabout how the halving will impact the amount of energy involved in bitcoin\nmining.\n\nLars Hagberg/AFP via Getty Images\n\nSome believe halvings can even lead to less energy being consumed as some of\nthe miners that can't compete any longer will just give up. Paying a lot for\nenergy to obtain just over 3 bitcoin tokens will no longer make financial\nsense for them, according to this logic.\n\nIt's similar to what has happened with extracting oil. As the supply of oil\ngets reduced and as the fossil fuel gets harder to extract, smaller players\ndrop out, unable to compete with the financial and technological resources of\na Big Oil company.\n\nStill, regardless of what happens, one thing's for sure. There's still an\nincredible amount of energy that will be spent to unveil bitcoin \u2014 and it will\nremain a controversial topic for a while.\n\n  * halving\n  * crypto\n  * bitcoin\n\n### More Stories From NPR\n\n##### Health\n\n#### Rise and grind?
