There seems to be a general\nperception among left-leaning activists (but particularly students, who tend\nto be involved in more discursive debates) that the right-wing politicization\nof young people is now far outstripping that of the left. Though this is for\nthe most part an online phenomenon, the more mainstream acceptance of right-\nwing cultural interventions is something to be wary of. There are also certain\nevents that hint at how the New Right might take material shape in the future:\nfor instance, young nationalist youth volunteering to go \u201cfight the traitors\u201d\nin Hong Kong. Though the struggle in Hong Kong has a complex and unique\ncharacter, we suspect that similar sentiments could be mobilized in other,\nhypothetical, instances of severe civil unrest in the future. However, in\norder to deflate the oft-invoked specter of a hyper-authoritarian China, we\nhave to emphasize here that online comment boards do not compose a real right-\nwing mass movement. At present, the Chinese state has little need for the mass\nmobilization of a militaristic far-right. But the slow gestation and\npopularization of right-wing thought is nonetheless worth deep examination.\n\nThe following article was originally posted on Tootopia (\u571f\u8c46\u516c\u793e) in February of\n2019.^1 We\u2019ve chosen to translate it for a few reasons: First, it acts as a\ngood representation of the types of cultural commentary circulating among\nyoung Chinese leftists. We can thereby see how such an audience regards the\nideological mechanisms that lie behind cultural production, and how social\ncommentary is voiced in response to such mechanisms. Second, it offers a good\ncritique of two major trends in the contemporary Chinese political scene, at\nleast as they manifest online. Though some of those who hold similar positions\nmight consider themselves \u201con the left\u201d in some fashion, we define such\npositions as within the Chinese New Right. In line with this, the author\ndissects these two right-wing trends of thought, illustrating yet again how\nvariants of nationalism, often alloyed with a fetishization of industrial\ndevelopment, act as a sort of a priori presumption within the Chinese\npolitical scene. The article itself stands out precisely because of its\nemphasis on internationalism\u2014although the author still seems to counterpose a\n\u201ctrue patriotism\u201d against the more reactionary forms of nationalism detailed\nhere.\n\nThe two trends singled out by the article are translated here as \u201cPrometheans\u201d\nand \u201cYoung Cyber-Nationalists.\u201d But it should be noted that no adequate, exact\ntranslations exist for the original terms. Translated more literally, they are\nthe \u201cIndustrial Party\u201d (\u5de5\u4e1a\u515a) and \u201cLittle Pinks\u201d (\u5c0f\u7c89\u7ea2), respectively. The\nauthor gives a more specific definition of each, emphasizing the basic\ndemographic and class background of the two trends\u2019 supporters. But some basic\nknowledge of each term is presumed, so it will help to give a brief overview\nto orient the reader: The \u201cIndustrial Party\u201d is often used interchangeably\nwith the \u201cParty of Technology\u201d (\u6280\u672f\u515a), and both are terms that refer to those\nwho believe that the advancement of technology via industrial development is\nthe most essential element behind human progress and drives ideological\nchanges. Though this seems to express a basic Marxist position, the emphasis\nis placed on technology itself, rather than the reorganization of the\nrelations of production. It is usually (though not always) expressed as a form\nof technological reductionism, then, and carries similar connotations as\nPromethianism in English, which bears a symmetrical ambiguity (i.e. it\u2019s\npossible to interpret it as a form of reductionism, but it\u2019s also possible to\ncast it in a more charitable light). The term \u201cLittle Pinks,\u201d by contrast, has\nless breadth. It refers to netizens who patriotically defend China online\u2014both\non the domestic and overseas Chinese internet. They are on average very young,\nand at this point have very little presence offline. In this regard, they are\nmaybe comparable to the early years of the alt-right in the US, though without\nany attempt to incorporate \u201ccountercultural\u201d elements into their nationalism.\nWe translate it as \u201cYoung Cyber-Nationalists,\u201d emphasizing the meaning but\nlosing the simultaneously diminutive and illustrative phrasing of the\noriginal.\n\nThe entry-point for the author\u2019s critique of these trends is not, however,\novertly political. Instead, each is explored through their cultural presence,\nwith the author arguing that both trends converge in their defense of the\npopular sci-fi film The Wandering Earth. In recent years, the international\nrenown of Chinese science fiction has grown rapidly, after being catapulted to\nprominence by well-received translations of Liu Cixin\u2019s Three Body Trilogy.\nNow a series of major films and possible television series are in the works,\nlargely based on Liu\u2019s writing. Meanwhile, lesser-known Chinese sci-fi authors\nhave begun to make a name for themselves in English, largely due to the\ntranslation work of American-born-Chinese author and translator Ken Liu. The\nrange of Chinese sci-fi on offer in English has broadened substantially, and\nit\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that the genre is now one of the most popular\nforms of Chinese cultural production consumed by foreigners. This has also\ninflated its importance for the Chinese state, which is intentionally building\n\u201csoft power\u201d via the promotion of domestic cultural products overseas. Though\nLiu\u2019s books have already reached widespread popularity, the real key to this\neffort is a series of Chinese-produced films capable of challenging Hollywood-\nstyle blockbusters. The film version of Liu Cixin\u2019s short story, The Wandering\nEarth, is one of the first major films released in this effort. A fully\ndomestic production, the movie performed well despite departing substantially\nfrom the source material. It is currently China\u2019s second-highest grossing film\nof all time, as well as the second-highest grossing non-English film of all\ntime (behind \u6218\u72fc2 \u2013 Wolf Warrior 2, another Chinese production with strong\nnationalist undertones), and has made it into the top 20 highest-grossing sci-\nfi films of all time.\n\nLike any major cultural production, it reflects the contradictions underlying\nthe \u201ccommon sense\u201d ideology of the society that produced it. This is the entry\npoint for the author, who sees the film as a looking glass capable of showing\nthe conservative core of the film\u2019s political presumptions. The original\ntitle, difficult to translate literally, refers to the zhaoyaojing (\u7167\u5996\u955c), a\nmagical mirror referenced in ancient Chinese literature that reveals ghosts\nand demons in its reflection. A related folk superstition led to the practice\nof hanging circular mirrors, referred to as zhaoyaojing, above main entryways\nof a new house. The author\u2019s original title might then be translated as\nsomething like: Wandering Earth: A Magic Mirror Reflecting the Monstrosity of\nthe Prometheans and Young Cyber-Nationalists. The idea is, essentially, that\nthe conservative nucleus of these trends of thought is revealed in the film\u2019s\nmirroring of these ideological assumptions, and especially in the fan response\nto the film\u2019s reception. Though we don\u2019t endorse all the positions taken by\nthe author, the piece is a rare intervention against the kind of default\nnationalism assumed by many activists and political theorists (\u201cleft\u201d and\nright) in China.\n\n\u2013Chuang\n\nIntroduction by Tootopia Editors\n\nWu Jing, idol of the young cyber-nationalists, and Liu Cixin, spiritual leader\nof the Prometheans, have come together to create the film Wandering Earth.\nIt\u2019s only natural that these two groups, happily joined together, couldn\u2019t\nstand to see the Douban hipsters deflate the film\u2019s average rating.^2 But in\nthe background of this great spat, the powers of contemporary China\u2019s three\nmajor tides of thought collide.\n\nThe Wandering Earth: A Reflection of the Chinese Right\n\nBy Yuyan\n\nOriginally posted on Tootopia, 13 February 2019\n\nAs in previous years, the lineup at movie theaters during the Spring Festival\nis divided up between domestic productions. But this year, one stands out: the\ncontroversial and popular film, The Wandering Earth. Aside from the extremely\nflattering media and the inevitable disappointment that accompanies the film\u2019s\ndeparture from its eponymous source, the controversy has largely arisen from\ntwo entertainment figures who, when they make public appearances, project an\naura that attracts die-hard fans: Wu Jing, the protagonist, and Liu Cixin, the\nstory\u2019s author. And these two individuals thereby represent two major trends\nin contemporary Chinese society\n\nSpokespeople of the Young Cyber-Nationalists and Prometheans\n\nWu Jing has today become a symbolic representative for the ideas of the young\ncyber-nationalists, similar to what happened to Sylvester Stallone after First\nBlood, where he played an American soldier in Vietnam. The young cyber-\nnationalists are 20-somethings with a relatively low level of education,\nsitting somewhere in the lower rungs of the urban middle class. They believe\nthat hostile forces from overseas are either the root of all evil in Chinese\nsociety, or at least are the main obstacles to be overcome, and they therefore\nthink highly of China\u2019s rapid rise in military power and its hard diplomacy.\n\nLiu Cixin has become the spokesperson of the Promethean trend, which is based\namong people in their thirties and forties who tend to have a higher level of\neducation and compose the upper rungs of the urban middle class. They hope\nthat China\u2019s industrial level can quickly surpass that of the West, and they\nrevere the idea of a small intellectual elite ruling a country. But they also\noften fear that the vast uneducated masses might decide to rise up and lay\nsiege to the efficient order of the elites. It is, then, very easy for them to\ntake pleasure in the fictional scenes of extreme cruelty in Liu Cixin\u2019s\nwriting, because, in their opinion, such scenes of cruelty are simply a\nreflection of the dog-eat-dog reality of the world (domestically and\ninternationally). This leads to the conclusion that the small intellectual\nelite must become strong leaders, since the masses cannot rule themselves and\ntherefore must be protected by the intellectual elite while also following\ntheir orders, which are pronounced in the name of science.\n\nThe hope and imagination of Chinese Science Fiction gathers these two groups\ntogether under a single banner. On the one hand, the young cyber-nationalists\nconsider Chinese-made Hollywood-style blockbusters to be a symbol of cultural\nsoft power. On the other, the Prometheans take Chinese sci-fi movies to be a\nsymbol of China\u2019s technological hard power. Therefore, although the film has\nalmost completely transformed the plot of the original novel, especially\ninsofar as it changed the portrayal of the masses from ignorant and backward\nto wise and courageous, both sides have nonetheless found a powerful resonance\nin their unyielding support for such domestic sci-fi films. Ultimately, both\nsides are volunteer propagandists for the state (ziganwu),^3 deeply driven by\nthe emotive power of narrow nationalism and a spirit of exceptionalism. The\nPrometheans are simply a more rational and refined version of the young cyber-\nnationalists, while the young cyber-nationalists are young, precocious\nversions of the Prometheans, and as they age they will become Prometheans\nthemselves.\n\nA still from The Wandering Earth\n\nAfter the premiere of The Wandering Earth (now China\u2019s so-called number one\ndomestically produced hard sci-fi film), these keyboard warriors not only\nfound a shared idol, but, more important, they unexpectedly discovered a\nshared enemy. During the Spring Festival most people have substantial free\ntime, and therefore a severe conflict was ignited online over the weeklong\nbreak, each faction intensifying its crusade against the other, such that the\ndie-hard fans of the movie devolved into unilateral condemnation of their\nopponents. The narrow nationalism and xenophobia of the young cyber-\nnationalists combined with the positivist zealotry and rationalist prejudice\nof the Prometheans to form a sort of fascist-style fanaticism within online\ndiscourse. Together, they sought to suppress any voice that questioned the\nfilm or was at all critical of it, howling, without a shred of irony: We must\nuphold The Wandering Earth! If you don\u2019t give it a good review, you are not\nChinese! If you don\u2019t give it a good review, you are not a patriot!\n\nDo We Want Wealth and Technology, or Science and Democracy?\n\nOn the other side of the controversy lie those who gave a low rating to The\nWandering Earth online, including all of those who criticized the film from\nvarious angles: whether this be their own personal experience of watching it,\ncritiques of the cinematic skill behind the film or the narrative sequence, or\nconceptual critiques like the portrayal of women, individual power, freedom of\nspeech or the transparency of public discourse. Faced with the fanatic assault\nof the young cyber-nationalists and the Prometheans, such disparate groups\ngradually started to cling together for protection, eventually forming a\nunited front. They did not concede to the opinion of many professional film-\nreviewers and kindhearted audience members, who argued that \u201ca blemish does\nnot obscure jade\u2019s luster.\u201d Instead, they persisted in assigning the film a\nlow ranking.\n\nIf this conflict has already far exceeded the box office success of the film\nitself, this is because it reflects a central contradiction that will arise in\nstruggles over the direction of the development of Chinese society over the\nnext decade: Do we want wealth and technology, or do we want science and\ndemocracy? In other words, do we want something like the desperate fighting\nagainst the tide represented by the Self-Strengthening Movement of Li\nHongzhang and Zeng Guofan, or do we want something more like the New Culture\nMovement of Chen Duxiu and Hu Shi, starting over from scratch?^4 For now, this\nquestion has not clearly pressed through to the surface. Instead, we can focus\non The Wandering Earth and the explosive debate within public discourse that\nhas accompanied it, as well as the social trends that sit behind this debate.\n\nTo be fair, although The Wandering Earth is full of scenes featuring over-\nidealized characters with exaggerated heroism, not to mention the film\u2019s\ngeneral anti-democratic and anti-scientific feudal values (for instance, the\nextremely conservative obsession with one\u2019s native soil: \u201cEarth has oppressed\nme thousands of times, but I am nonetheless attached to it\u201d), some of its\ncontent is still able to instigate a feeling of awe in the audience. For\nexample, people from all over the world coming together in the rescue mission,\nthe two astronauts sacrificing their lives for the benefit of all humanity,\nthe world deciding by lot which half of the population will take refuge in the\nunderground cities and which half must accept death. These aspects are strong\nmanifestations of modern values like liberty, equality and fraternity, which\nare themselves an incarnation of the heritage of socialism, embedded in the\nsubconscious of Chinese people.\n\nThe Underground Cities of The Wandering Earth\n\nUnfortunately, these aspects that accord with socialist values are merely\noccasional decorations, or simply asides, separate from the main act. All the\ngovernments and peoples of the world forgetting their old differences and\nworking together, what a moving scene! But what of the United Earth\nGovernment? And what of these people from all over the world? These topics,\nthough deserving of detailed exposition or at the very least some attention,\nare not even openly addressed in the film. The United Earth Government merely\ntoys with the protagonist, leading him in circles, and the people from all\nover the world are confronted by a series of setbacks which lead them to give\nup one by one until, hearing the crying plea of the female lead in a global\nbroadcast, they immediately leap up passionately and return to the struggle.\nFrom start to finish, the film\u2019s main focus is on a handful of heroes\ndetermining the fate of the world. The main recurring scene is merely an\nillustration of the deep feelings between father and son, placing a halo on\nthe protagonist. Such scenes also contain an implicit system of values: a\nmixture of the bewitching potion of feudal patriarchy and the self-help\n\u201cchicken soup for the soul\u201d of bourgeois individualism.^5 Both are little more\nthan stubborn relics that obstruct modern development and social progress. The\nchoices made about such scenes are not merely based on what is interesting or\nnot, but, in the end, reflect the values of the screenwriter and director. The\ninternationalist value system stressing the collective fate of humanity is\nlittle more than a stopover within this vacuous fantasy. Aside from the\nsaintly, omnipotent protagonist, the film offers no realistic or logical means\nto obtain this lofty dream. Instead, it has difficulty even concealing the\nmyriad power struggles and egocentric schemes that motivate its characters.\n\nA still from The Wandering Earth, featuring the recurring flashback scene that\nillustrates the relationship between the two main characters, father and son.\n\nTherefore, the film is really more of a Wuxia story disguised as sci-fi. The\nonly difference between the film and a classic Wuxia story in the style of Jin\nYong is simply that the fantasy figure of a heroic, knight-errant protagonist\nserving the broad masses is built up until he is actually saving all of\nhumanity. Moreover, despite being enveloped in the appearance of sci-fi, the\ncore element of sci-fi has been entirely excised: exploration of the\nrelationship between science and human society. The film doesn\u2019t reveal any\nideas about the future of society or humankind, merely fabricating an End\nTimes disaster for the characters to face. And this particular disaster is\nactually an expression of real disasters: capitalist economic crisis,\nenvironmental crisis, and crises of political legitimacy, as well as protests\nagainst them. It follows that the fantasy of a heroic savior, as well as the\nfantasy of all the people of the world, undivided by class or race, coming\ntogether to rescue themselves, ultimately become the sigh of the oppressed,\nthe heart of a heartless world, as if they were the spirit of the spiritless\ncapitalist system.\n\nBehind The Wandering Earth, the Underestimated IQ of the Audience\n\nNetizens satirically hit the nail on the head with their criticisms, arguing\nthat The Wandering Earth is not hard sci-fi but instead \u201ctrying-hard-to-be\nsci-fi,\u201d or that it\u2019s just got a \u201chard packaging of sci-fi\u201d and has been\n\u201cpressed hard to fit into the slot of sci-fi,\u201d and that its title should be\nchanged to The Clickbait Earth.^6 In a word: an embroidered pillow is still a\nbag of fluff. In everything from the main themes (rebellious heroism, familial\naffection, the coming-of-age process), to the narrative flow (following\nmultiple groups of characters, having the leads give speeches, including an\nelder and a pretty girl, showing the family photograph, valuing human life,\ndisplaying virtues of fraternity, having unexpected mishaps arise, a major\nclimax and a satisfactory ending), and the production methods (zooming camera\nshots, visual effects, impressive backdrops and symbols of consumption)\u2014all\nare completely copied from the style of Hollywood\u2019s film industry. The\nWandering Earth totally ignores the soul of cinematic art: telling a story.\n\nStill from The Wandering Earth\n\nAlmost every scene simply serves as a foil for the heroic lead characters,\ngiving an excuse to display exaggerated family values and nativist sentiments,\nas well as space for the deployment of Hollywood-style techniques. It is only\nfrom this perspective that the many weird and abrupt features of the film\u2019s\nnarrative make sense. For example: the spooky voices of the unseen United\nEarth Government, the AI system MOSS being rendered idiotic and taken over by\nthe heroic lead character, the female character (called \u201cDuoduo\u201d or \u201cYatou\u201d)\nwho always holds back the heroic lead, the heroic astronaut\u2019s wife who is\nwilling to sacrifice herself yet barely shows her face (to say nothing of\nplaying up her noble spirit), or the astronaut\u2019s mother-in-law who is\nremembered only in her service to a man (cooking a bowl of noodles for\nhim).... Or for another example, why didn\u2019t they edit out pointless subplots\nlike when Duoduo\u2019s failure to keep a secret caused a minor hero to be caught\nup in a car chase? These decisions were made not merely to match the Hollywood\nclich\u00e9s, as if any big blockbuster required a car chase. The more important\nreason the director makes these plot choices is to play tricks on the\naudience: when you\u2019re crying you can\u2019t pay attention to whether or not the\nplot is rational, so they do the utmost to stir up large emotions or send a\nside character to their death. They make you laugh in order to hinder you from\ngoing online and making malicious comments, not caring whether or not you\nunderstand the plot. Certainly, this is Hollywood\u2019s public secret: the vast\nmajority of audience members do not use rational thought, instead merely\ngiving a conditioned reflex in response to suggested moods, like lower-order\norganisms.\n\nThe Kernel of Reverse-Nationalism\n\nIn reality, if we\u2019re speaking of the \u201chard core,\u201d the true core of the film\nand the thing which unifies its supporters is a bone-deep kernel of reverse-\nnationalism, so customary that it\u2019s rarely called into question, summed up in\nthe thought: all things from the West are good and proper. Ironically, in the\neyes of many audience members, the film would be imbued with their nativist\nsentiments only after being disseminated and packaged through the media, and\ntherefore it became unacceptable to criticize their idol. Among the supporters\nof The Wandering Earth there are a few die-hard fans, but most are just\nkindhearted, down-to-earth people. Together, they criticize and jeer at those\nwho think Hollywood sci-fi films are superior, calling these people \u201cAdmirers\nof Foreign Dogs.\u201d But they don\u2019t realize that they are the pot calling the\nkettle black, because the very reasons they support The Wandering Earth are\nfounded on a standard of critique drawn from the Hollywood capitalist film\nindustry. Furthermore, Liu Cixin\u2019s novels and even contemporary Chinese sci-fi\nmore broadly has gained popularity in the media and within academic circles,\nthereby entering into the view of the public. But this started when Liu\nCixin\u2019s The Three Body Problem won the English-speaking world\u2019s Hugo Award for\nscience fiction, and a major reason for this was that the foreign translator,\nhimself a writer and avid fan, used more lively and literary language in the\ntranslation than in the original. To use another example: after Mo Yan won the\nNobel Prize for Literature, many WeChat feeds marketed articles falsely\nattributed to Mo Yan, in order to gain more traffic. This is yet another\nexample reflecting the way in which reverse nationalist thinking is universal\nwithin our country.\n\nBut the knockoff Hollywood images, the story\u2019s backdrop of a shared human\ndestiny, and the many tear-jerking moments of continual sacrifice for the sake\nof saving the earth\u2014all operate on the surface to cover up the many\ndeficiencies of The Wandering Earth\u2019s narrative and value system. Moreover,\nthe dissemination of \u201cthe number 1 domestically-produced hard sci-fi,\nHollywood-style blockbuster\u201d has itself produced simple nativist sentiments in\naudiences, despite such deficiencies, making them unwilling to go critique the\nfilm. This sort of simple nativism and the familial sentiments repeatedly\nshown in scenes of the son, father and grandfather are actually identical in\ntheir content: the foundation beneath both is the particularistic system of\nethics advocated by traditional Confucianism (\u201cclose relatives and distant\nrelatives should be treated differently,\u201d \u201crelatives cover for each other,\u201d\nsocial and biological determinism, etc.), rather than the universalist ethics\nadvocated by modern society (\u201cmaking the rules democratically in front of\neveryone,\u201d \u201cshowing love for others equally,\u201d \u201cheroes do not pay attention to\none\u2019s origins\u201d).^7 It\u2019s just like the popular online phrase says: \u201cYou can\nthrow a thousand curses at your alma mater, but can\u2019t bear it if others utter\njust one.\u201d Against the backdrop of all of humanity rescuing itself, the\nideology of the family nonetheless gives precedence to one\u2019s own immediate\nprogeny. From this, we can observe both the deficiency of imagination in the\nscript and its adherence to traditional values, all in one place. Taking this\nsort of particularistic ethics to the extreme, it follows that die-hard fans\nof the film would express a narrow nationalist way of thinking in phrases such\nas \u201cthe other must be different from me,\u201d or \u201cthose who wrong the Han will be\npunished no matter how far away they are.\u201d^8 What kind of work of art has\nthese sorts of fans? We can truly say: \u201cbirds of a feather flock together.\u201d\n\nWithout comparison there is no harm, although the lesson of history is that\npeople never absorb the lessons of history. The Russians spent 40 million RMB\non the production of Salyut 7, and compared to the 230 million RMB invested\ninto The Wandering Earth, it\u2019s hard to see the difference, yet the Douban\naudience score is only 7.7 (at the time the author finished writing The\nWandering Earth had already seen its score on Douban slide from 8.5 to 7.9).\nSome professional critics (for example: Zhang Xiaobei, Wuya Huotang, Xiedu\nDianying and Lu Zhiyu) were generous in giving The Wandering Earth 5-star\nreviews, showering it with praise and encouragement. Their main reason was\nthat the visual effects had the appearance of a Hollywood film\u2014but these same\nreviewers had only given the Russian film 3- or 4-stars. Another critic going\nby \u201cZhang Yongxuan Wayne@,\u201d though praising the film Salyut-7 (\u201cit uses low-\ncost techniques with great efficiency, reaching the same level of visual\neffects as Hollywood\u201d), nonetheless only gave it a very low 2 stars.\nMeanwhile, he gave The Wandering Earth the standard of 3 stars, afterwards\ngiving it the severe critique: \u201cThis is not China\u2019s premiere hard sci-fi film.\nI just have to say nice things, but on a personal level I was disappointed\nthat it did not meet my expectations, especially when it came to the fake-\nlooking the visual effects, which simply didn\u2019t meet the visual standards of\nsci-fi. Relying on the imaginative power of the novel, the execution was\nclearly weak. The development of the story and the attempt to implant deep\nfeelings were both particularly garish. Moreover, the use of digital confetti\naction shots and big explosions to stir up emotion as well as the constant,\nnarcissistic attempt to twist everything to fit a pedantic system of values\nwere both hideous. I was embarrassed to death on several occasions.\u201d^9 These\nfilm industry insiders\u2019 attitude is narrowly focused on protecting their baby\nand defending the industry\u2019s common interests.\n\nA still from Salyut-7\n\nOne user, calling himself \u201cFan of modern Chinese history\u201d gave the film a low\none-star, offering the reason: \u201cOur nation has been harmed and humiliated by\npolar bears [i.e. Russians] for nearly two centuries, much longer than by the\nJapanese, and while the latter have expressed remorse, the polar bears think\nthey haven\u2019t done anything wrong... so I reject anything produced by them....\nOf course this may not be entirely fair regarding films and the struggling\nmasses, but... so the fuck what?\u201d This narrow nativist sentiment is at last\ntaken to its conclusion! We cannot help but ask, are Russians not also members\nof the great human family? If The Wandering Earth, as Chinese people\u2019s botched\ncopy of a Hollywood blockbuster, is worthy of encouragement, then are the\nRussians\u2019 successful imitations not also worthy? Are we really saying that\nChinese people can only encourage things Made in China, and cannot support\nthings made even better in other countries?\n\nWhat is a Good Chinese Movie?\n\nNonetheless, returning to the point, of course we can encourage domestic\nproductions! As long as the artwork is actually excellent, there\u2019s no problem.\nFor example, the 1986 film, Dislocation, a genuine hard sci-fi film. Raising\nthe issue of the relationship between robots and humans, the film could even\nbe considered the first major milestone in domestically-produced sci-fi\nmovies. And yet how many people have heard of it? I\u2019m ashamed to say that it\nwas only through the discourse around The Wandering Earth that I myself just\nheard of it. If you have no resources to find older films online, you can read\nthe newly released, domestically produced short story The Realism of The\nWandering Earth,^10 and learn about the fundamental components and real charm\nof sci-fi stories\u2014rather than following only those authors and critics who\nblindly chase after Western book prizes. It is a mistake to think that it is\nonly those who win Western awards or conform to Western critical standards are\nproducing excellent works of art.\n\nThinking back a little, in the course of Chinese filmmakers\u2019 arduous struggle\nthrough the \u201850s to the \u201890s, a number of excellent works were produced. But\nnone relied on large charity investments or ticket sales, and they didn\u2019t\ncater to the nationalist tailing of Hollywood standards either. Instead, they\nrelied on a sincere pursuit of social progress and human liberation. Even The\nWandering Earth makes its audience feel fragments of such lofty ideas, with\nthe heritage of socialist culture deeply engraved in it. But today, if we do\nnot break free from the mechanisms of film production dominated by capital and\npower (\u6743\u8d35), trying in vain to rely on vested interests, then any efforts to\neffect a renaissance of Chinese film will be as doomed to failure as Sun\nWukong trying to escape the Buddha\u2019s Palm.^11 The Wandering Earth is no more\nthan another disappointing milestone on this wrongheaded path of the arts.\n\nOne of the Ancients said: \u201cThe good thing about The Water Margin is that they\nsurrendered, so it can provide a negative lesson for the People: they can know\nwho surrendered.\u201d^12 Another said: \u201cThe Water Margin is very clear: Since they\ndid not oppose heaven, they are granted amnesty when the army comes, and they\nare ultimately employed on behalf of the nation, fighting other bandits\u2014they\nare no longer bandits \u2018Acting for Heaven and Exercising Morality.\u2019 They have\nat last become slaves.\u201d^13 At last we come to the point! It is lucky that The\nWandering Earth has drawn out such lofty dreams, heavy with the hope of saving\nall humanity, while also drawing out those over-ambitious, narrow patriots\nproclaiming the hegemony of China over the world, as well as the fake\ninternationalists. This is truly a magic mirror, allowing us to see through\nthe conspiracy! It is only the true patriots and real internationalists, not\nplacing their own country above others and seeking the real unity of the\nentire world, who have had the courage to give deep thought to The Wandering\nEarth and say \u201cno,\u201d critiquing the film and critiquing themselves. This is\nnever an easy task, since it requires that you be strict with yourself.\nHowever, these nationalist youth happily dancing across the stage are in\nreality not completely useless. In fact, they may be able to act as the main\nforce of a New Democratic Revolution. But since the husk is so severely\nrotten, it will never be able to contain them, and they will have an urge to\nburst through the cocoon. We will then be able to act as the vanguard of the\nnext socialist transformation. The lesson of history is that people never\nlearn the lesson of history. We might as well wait and see.\n\nNotes from Chuang\n\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n\n  1. Tootopia was probably the most popular platform for Chinese left millennials until it was shut down by censors in a wave of repression earlier this year.\n  2. Douban is a major Chinese social media network and includes a feature for user rankings of popular media. The reference here is to a recent controversy, in which some have accused users of receiving bribes in exchange for giving The Wandering Earth a low rating on Douban, and/or changing previously good reviews into bad ones. Despite little evidence, Douban was forced to respond to the accusations, though it\u2019s unclear if any action was taken. Also note that the original Chinese has been simplified here. The original (\u81ea\u8be9\u6587\u827a\u9752\u5e74\u7684\u8c46\u74e3\u74dc\u53cb\u4eec) is more literally translated as self-satisfied Douban Hipsters eating melon on the sidelines, referring to the phrase \u5403\u74dc\u7fa4\u4f17, (literally: melon-eating masses) which evokes the image of people eating melon on the sidelines as they watch the spectacle of great events passing by. The connotation is similar to the English word \u201csheeple,\u201d but more specifically refers to ignorant spectators, rather than just ignorant masses in general.\n  3. This is an abbreviation of the author\u2019s own phrase: \u201c\u81ea\u5e26\u5e72\u7cae\u7684\u4e94\u6bdb\u515a\u201d, the final three characters, wumaodang (the \u201c50 Cent Party\u201d) are a shorthand for online propagandists of official positions, who were once rumored to be paid fifty cents for every post they made in support of the regime. The first three characters zidai ganliang (literally \u201cwho bring their own rations\u201d) implies that these posters are doing the work of the 50 Cent Party, but for free. An English-language Wikipedia page is available with more detail on the history of the 50 Cent Party: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_Cent_Party>\n  4. The Self-Strengthening Movement was an effort at reform undertaken during the late Qing dynasty, following the defeat of China in the Opium Wars and the turmoil caused by the Taiping rebellion. Li Hongzhang and Zeng Guofan were both military generals and scholar-officials, each having led efforts to suppress the Taiping rebels and then to support economic and military modernization. The Self-Strengthening Movement was, in some respects, comparable to the Meiji Restoration in Japan, but was in others far more limited: it sought to largely keep political structures and cultural practices intact, purely engaging in a technical modernization of the economy and military. Though influential for later reformists, it was proven a definitive failure after China\u2019s defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895). The author uses it here as an example of an attempt to force limited reform while preventing a change in the political structure and maintaining conservative cultural practices, describing the Self-Strengthening Movement as \u201c\u529b\u633d\u72c2\u6f9c\u201d(liwankuanglan), literally \u201cpulling strongly against a furious tide,\u201d or exerting all one\u2019s energy to save a desperate situation. The opposing reference used here is to the New Culture Movement, a later reformist effort that included both liberals and the far-left, and was based in a more complete modernization, founded on the reinvention of culture from the ground up using modern (often Western) practices, and emphasizing things like vernacular literature and an engagement with Western philosophical and political schools. The author notes both the involvement of Hu Shi, a prominent liberal and later supporter of the Nationalists (fleeing with them to Taiwan, where he became a well-known academic), as well Chen Duxiu, founder of the Chinese Communist Party.\n  5. The term \u9e21\u6c64, literally \u201cchicken soup\u201d is a reference to \u201cchicken soup for the soul\u201d as translated from the English book series of the same name. But the term has come to be used more widely in Chinese for any ideology aimed to boosting optimism that your life will improve through individual effort, soothing discontent about economic hardship by perpetuating Horatio Alger stories and the myth of \u201cpulling yourself up by your bootstraps.\u201d\n  6. These sarcastic criticisms all involve wordplay in the original Chinese, which has only been loosely reproduced here. The term for \u201chard sci-fi\u201d is \u201c\u786c\u6838\u79d1\u5e7b\u201d (yinghe kehuan), and the criticisms each play with alternate forms that use \u786c, meaning hard, stiff, firm, etc.: \u786c\u8981(yingyao) to try hard to do something, \u786c\u58f3 (yingke) a crust or hard shell, and the combination of \u786c(ying) and \u5957 (tao), the latter a verb meaning both to envelope, sheathe or encase, as well as to copy. Similarly, the term translated here as \u201cclickbait\u201d in Chinese is \u6d41\u91cf (liuliang), just meaning mobile data, but here refers to its use in the term \u5237\u6d41\u91cf (shualiuliang) which means something like \u201cclick farming.\u201d This creates a pun with the film\u2019s title, since the word for \u201cwandering,\u201d \u6d41\u6d6a (liulang), sounds almost identical.\n  7. The original Chinese for the quoted \u201cConfucian\u201d phrases above (\u4eb2\u758f\u6709\u522b\u3001\u4eb2\u4eb2\u76f8\u9690) are not actually derived from Confucius, but are instead mostly quotes about Confucianism popularized during the Cultural Revolution. Meanwhile, the use of \u201csocial and biological determinism\u201d here is an assumption of the author\u2019s meaning. The original Chinese is simply (\u51fa\u8eab\u8bba\u8840\u7edf\u8bba), but both these terms (chushenlun and xuetonglun) were opposing theories of \u201cdeterminism\u201d during the Cultural Revolution. The author seems to be using them interchangeably here, however, just to indicate a general determinism about one\u2019s social class and status.\n  8. Both of these are set phrases derived from Chinese history. Their original form did not imply modern connotations of racial difference or nationalism, but they seem to have gained some degree of this meaning through later use, as indicated by the author\u2019s use of these phrases here. The original Chinese is \u201c\u975e\u6211\u65cf\u7c7b,\u5176\u5fc3\u5fc5\u5f02\u201d and \u201c\u72af\u6211\u5f3a\u6c49,\u867d\u8fdc\u5fc5\u8bdb\u201d respectively.\n  9. The term \u201cembarrassed to death\u201d here is a very distant translation of a Chinese internet phrase often used to describe particularly hackneyed aspects of film and television: \u201c\u5c34\u5c2c\u764c\u72af (ganga aifan)\u201d literally translated as something like \u201ccancerously embarrassed,\u201d with the connotation that the embarrassment (\u5c34\u5c2c) is a cancer-like (\u764c) violation (\u72af).\n  10. This story was originally posted on Weibo, and can be found on the Western internet here: <http://www.dapenti.com/blog/more.asp?name=xilei&id=138522>\n  11. This refers to the famous bet between the Monkey King Sun Wukong and the Buddha, in which Sun bets the Buddha that he can escape the Buddha\u2019s palm. He runs to the edge of the earth, finding five pillars, and carves his name there. Thinking that he\u2019d succeeded, he returns and discovers that the pillars were the Buddha\u2019s fingers. The Buddha then imprisons him underneath a mountain for five hundred years.\n  12. The Quotation is from Mao Zedong, spoken in 1975 during the final year of the \u201clong\u201d Cultural Revolution. During the Cultural Revolution The Water Margin was included in a wide-ranging campaign to critique the Chinese classics, and students were instructed to \u201cCritique The Water Margin, and criticize Song Jiang\u201d (Song Jiang is the novel\u2019s hero).
