As one of the five\npermanent members of the Security Council, Russia has veto power over any\nresolution that comes before the body. China abstained from the vote, and 13\nother members of the Security Council voted in favor of the resolution.\n\nIf it passed, the resolution would have affirmed a binding obligation in\nArticle IV of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which says nations are \"not to\nplace in orbit around the Earth any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any\nother kinds of weapons of mass destruction.\"\n\n## Going nuclear\n\nRussia is one of 115 parties to the Outer Space Treaty. The Security Council\nvote Wednesday follows reports in February that Russia is developing a nuclear\nanti-satellite weapon.\n\n\"The United States assesses that Russia is developing a new satellite carrying\na nuclear device,\" said Jake Sullivan, President Biden's national security\nadvisor. \"We have heard President Putin say publicly that Russia has no\nintention of deploying nuclear weapons in space. If that were the case, Russia\nwould not have vetoed this resolution.\"\n\nThe United States and Japan proposed the joint resolution, which also called\non nations not to develop nuclear weapons or any other weapons of mass\ndestruction designed to be placed into orbit around the Earth. In a statement,\nUS and Japanese diplomats highlighted the danger of a nuclear detonation in\nspace. Such an event would have \"grave implications for sustainable\ndevelopment, and other aspects of international peace and security,\" US\nofficials said in a press release.\n\nWith its abstention from the vote, \"China has shown that it would rather\ndefend Russia as its junior partner, than safeguard the global\nnonproliferation regime,\" said Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to\nthe UN.\n\nUS government officials have not offered details about the exact nature of the\nanti-satellite weapon they say Russia is developing. A nuclear explosion in\norbit would destroy numerous satellites\u2014from many countries\u2014and endanger\nastronauts. Space debris created from a nuclear detonation could clutter\norbital traffic lanes needed for future spacecraft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Soviet Union launched more than 30 military satellites powered by nuclear\nreactors. Russia's military space program languished in the first couple of\ndecades after the fall of the Soviet Union, and US intelligence officials say\nit still lags behind the capabilities possessed by the US Space Force and the\nChinese military.\n\nRussia's military funding has largely gone toward the war in Ukraine for the\nlast two years, but Putin and other top Russian officials have raised threats\nof nuclear force and attacks on space assets against adversaries. Russia's\nmilitary launched a cyberattack against a commercial satellite communications\nnetwork when it invaded Ukraine in 2022.\n\nRussia has long had an appetite for anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons. The Soviet\nUnion experimented with \"co-orbital\" ASATs in the 1960s and 1970s. When\ndeployed, these co-orbital ASATs would have attacked enemy satellites by\napproaching them and detonating explosives or using a grappling arm to move\nthe target out of orbit.\n\nEnlarge / Russian troops at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in far northern Russia\nprepare for the launch of a Soyuz rocket with the Kosmos 2575 satellite in\nFebruary.\n\nRussian Ministry of Defense\n\nIn 1987, the Soviet Union launched an experimental weapons platform into orbit\nto test laser technologies that could be used against enemy satellites. Russia\nshot down one of its own satellites in 2021 in a widely condemned \"direct\nascent\" ASAT test. This Russian direct ascent ASAT test followed\ndemonstrations of similar capability by China, the United States, and India.\nRussia's military has also demonstrated satellites over the last decade that\ncould grapple onto an adversary's spacecraft in orbit, or fire a projectile to\ntake out an enemy satellite.\n\nThese ASAT capabilities could destroy or disable one enemy satellite at a\ntime. The US Space Force is getting around this threat by launching large\nconstellations of small satellites to augment the military's much larger\nlegacy communications, surveillance, and missile warning spacecraft. A nuclear\nASAT weapon could threaten an entire constellation or render some of space\ninaccessible due to space debris.\n\nRussia's ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, called this week's UN\nresolution \"an unscrupulous play of the United States\" and a \"cynical forgery\nand deception.\" Russia and China proposed an amendment to the resolution that\nwould have banned all weapons in space. This amendment got the support of\nabout half of the Security Council but did not pass.\n\nOutside the 15-member Security Council, the original resolution proposed by\nthe United States and Japan won the support of more than 60 nations as co-\nsponsors.\n\n\"Regrettably, one permanent member decided to silence the critical message we\nwanted to send to the present and future people of the world: Outer space must\nremain a domain of peace, free of weapons of mass destruction, including\nnuclear weapons,\" said Kazuyuki Yamazaki, Japan's ambassador to the UN.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n136\n\nStephen Clark Stephen Clark is a space reporter at Ars Technica, covering\nprivate space companies and the world\u2019s space agencies.
