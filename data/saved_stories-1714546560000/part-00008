This is well\ndocumented: in the 2024 Academic Freedom Index update produced by V-Dem, a\nproject on democracy based in Gothenburg, Sweden, India is ranked in the\nbottom 20% of a list of 179 countries and territories on metrics such as\n\u2018institutional autonomy\u2019 and \u2018freedom to research and teach\u2019.\n\nHistorically, academic freedoms were certainly not perfect in India. Yet even\na cursory glance at the evidence reveals that the scale of restrictions and\nthe misuse of laws to curb academic freedom has increased. In the interests of\npreserving India\u2019s global competitiveness, whoever wins the election should\nseek to reverse this trend.\n\nClimatologist Michael Mann wins defamation case: what it means for scientists\n\nThe documented drop in academic freedom is part of a broader decline in\nIndia\u2019s vibrant culture of public debate. I have personally witnessed the\ngrowing restrictions during my 15 years as a researcher at the New Delhi-based\nCentre for Policy Research (CPR), where I served as president for 7 years\nuntil I stepped down in March.\n\nMy own research community \u2014 think tanks that aim to support evidence-based\npolicies \u2014 engages deeply with the global academic and policy ecosystem. Given\nthat public funds have many competing priorities, much of our research relies\non international philanthropic funding. That is becoming increasingly\ndifficult to come by, owing to a tightening of the Foreign Contribution\n(Regulation) Act (FCRA), which controls licences to access foreign funding.\n\nFor instance, after amendments to this law in 2020, recipients of foreign\nfunding cannot give subgrants to other organizations, making collaborative\nresearch impossible. And since 2014, nearly 17,000 civil-society organizations\nhave lost their FCRA licences altogether. For those that still have a licence,\nthe renewal process is onerous. Many organizations receive temporary\nextensions of three to six months, rather than the full period of five years\nallowed under law.\n\nWhy Joe Biden\u2019s bid to restore scientific integrity matters\n\nIt seems that tax laws are also increasingly being used against institutions.\nSome research organizations are facing penalties and, in extreme cases, the\nloss of their tax-exempt status, which is required for accessing charitable\ndonations. In September 2022, six institutions, including the CPR, were\nsubject to tax \u2018surveys\u2019 that eventually resulted in them having both their\nFCRA licences and their tax-exempt statuses revoked. This has left them mired\nin legal minutiae and struggling to fund their work.\n\nSimilar challenges to the freedom to pursue independent research are visible\non university campuses. In 2022, the India Academic Freedom Network (IAFN)\nprepared a status report for the United Nations special rapporteur on freedom\nof opinion and expression. It lists 78 instances in which seminars, lectures\nor talks at public universities were disrupted by politically aligned groups\nor the permission to organize such events was denied. It also lists 25 cases\nof faculty arrests, including some under anti-terror and sedition laws \u2014\nmostly for speaking on issues of public interest, on campus or in social-media\nposts. A further 37 incidents pertain to the arrest of students. The IAFN\nreport also points to difficulties associated with foreign researchers\nobtaining visas and entering India \u2014 even for people who hold Overseas\nCitizenship of India cards.\n\nAll this comes at a juncture when critical feedback and effective consultation\nare required to secure the country\u2019s long-term growth and prosperity. But\nrather than engage with ideas and challenge them in the spirit of inquiry and\npublic debate, in my view, it has now become increasingly common for\ntechnocrats in government to seek to discredit researchers and suppress\nresearch. In late 2023, for instance, the World Bank removed from its website\nan important study that highlighted reversals of progress recorded under a\nflagship sanitation programme. The bank cited procedural issues, but was\npresumably under government pressure.\n\nHow to protect US science from political meddling after Trump\n\nEven crucial government data are now hard to obtain. The decennial census, for\nexample, was last conducted in 2010\u201311; the public report on the 2017\u201318\nhousehold consumption expenditure survey was junked and only partial data have\nbeen released from the 2022\u201323 survey. The consequences of this are\nsignificant. In my field, development and social policy, the data gaps make it\nharder to measure changes in well-being. The debate on poverty reduction is\nbogged down in estimates, leaving the public with relatively little objective\nanalysis on the reach and effectiveness of economic policies.\n\nTo reverse these trends, researchers must make their voices heard and be\nwilling to defend the principle and value of academic freedom in the public\ndomain. Research bodies should engage more effectively with philanthropists in\nIndia and find ways to preserve the space for civil discourse. An alliance\nwith broader civil society is also required to push back against draconian\nregulations that undermine scientific freedoms.\n\nIndia\u2019s experience is not unique, but a reflection of a broader malaise. The\nV-Dem report makes it clear that several countries \u2014 including the United\nStates, where university campuses are in turmoil \u2014 have witnessed a\ndeterioration in the space available to pursue independent research.\nResearchers in India and elsewhere should fight to retain that space. It will\nbe a long and difficult battle. But it is an essential one.\n\nNature 629, 9 (2024)\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01214-1\n\nReprints and permissions\n\n### Competing Interests\n\nThe author declares no competing interests.\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * Why Joe Biden\u2019s bid to restore scientific integrity matters\n\n  * Why Nature needs to cover politics now more than ever\n\n  * How to protect US science from political meddling after Trump\n\n  * Death threats, trolling and sexist abuse: climate scientists report online attacks\n\n  * Climatologist Michael Mann wins defamation case: what it means for scientists\n\n## Subjects\n\n  * Government\n  * Institutions\n  * Politics\n  * Scientific community\n\n## Latest on:\n\nThis social sciences hub galvanized India's dynamic growth.
