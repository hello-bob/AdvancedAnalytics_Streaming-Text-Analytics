I like the idea of gifts to the commons. I like the\nidealism, this na\u00efve belief that if we all do our part, we can make beautiful\nthings together. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve spent the past few months committed to\nprofiling the open source community for this blog. Now, I know that I was\nstupid. In our culture, open source does not represent freedom. It represents\nan exploitive relationship, where wealth is brutally extracted from\nmaintainers (I could keep going forever). And I can\u2019t think of a better\nexample than Bountysource. Why is nobody talking about this?\n\nOne of the core issues in open source is that there tends to be immense\nfeelings of entitlement in downstream consumers. They have somehow convinced\nthemselves that just by using your stuff, they deserve support. Obviously,\nthis relationship is utterly broken. Bountysource promised to fix this issue,\nby enabling users to \u201cfund\u201d issues. Issues with higher funding would be\nprioritized by maintainers:\n\nAnd so, the maintainer is empowered to demand compensation for their work, at\nlong last.\n\n## Trouble in paradise\n\nBountysource grew and grew, permeating into all corners of open source. A\nbrief survey of GitHub shows that 55,000 issues make reference to it, and the\narchives show triumphs for projects like Borgbackup, ElementaryOS, Nextcloud,\nand Nim. Bountysource represented a rising tide, but they could not avoid the\nallure of wealth.\n\nIn 2017, the project was purchased by the cryptocurrency company CanYa, and in\n2020 it was sold to \u201cThe Blockchain Group\u201d. Coincidently, around this time,\nthe Bountysource project announced drastic changes to its terms of service,\nenabling them to steal unclaimed bounties after two years:\n\n> 2.13 Bounty Time-Out. If no Solution is accepted within two years after a\n> Bounty is posted, then the Bounty will be withdrawn and the amount posted\n> for the Bounty will be retained by Bountysource. For Bounties posted before\n> June 30, 2018, the Backer may redeploy their Bounty to a new Issue by\n> contacting support@bountysource.com before July 1, 2020. If the Backer does\n> not redeploy their Bounty by the deadline, the Bounty will be withdrawn and\n> the amount posted for the Bounty will be retained by Bountysource.\n\nAfter backlash the company reversed course, and business continued as usual.\nThere was barely any publicity hit.\n\nWhile things seemed better, business continued at an agonizingly slow pace.\nGitHub issues show that at numerous moments in time, payments were left\npending for months on end. Some developers claimed that as early as June 2023,\ntheir payouts amounting to thousands of dollars went ignored. Soon after,\nafter showing signs of crisis, the company quietly announced bankruptcy in\n2023, leaving tens of thousands of dollars left unpaid.\n\n## Casualties\n\nThere has been shockingly little discussion of this event. The community\nquietly accepted their loss, and the voices of developers who lost thousands\nof dollars were never amplified. This is but another sorrow of open source.\nIt\u2019s not unique in any type of way: open source developers were simply\nexploited once again, as is usual. Their sorrows were not given voice. I still\ndon\u2019t have much of a platform. I cannot give these maintainers the attention\nthey deserve. But I need to try. Here are the known casualties of\nBountysource:\n\nProject| Amount  \n---|---  \nNewPipe| $6000+  \nFreeCAD| $4279.10  \nquickwritereader| $4000  \ntheoryshaw| $3500  \nparvit| $1100  \ndavidebeatrici| $1000+  \nabebeos| $1000  \nabmyii| $200  \njaapmarcus| $190  \nPythonSwiftLink| $150  \nThomasWaldmann| $144  \nthesquash| $139  \nTotal| $17,779+  \nThis only accounts for the developers who had completed their work and were\nawaiting payment. It is likely that magnitudes more money was held in escrow,\nwhich has also been lost. This means that not only were the developers harmed\n\u2014 the few people who found it in their heart to donate were also scammed. Who\nknows how many more thousand dollars are still missing. For now, the man and\nthe woman and their henchmen who stole from the FOSS community continue to run\nfree.  \n  \nEvan Boehs /node/bountysource\n\nYou are the 133rd visitor to this page!
