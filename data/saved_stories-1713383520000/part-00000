Your design. No dependencies.\n\nDownload\n\n#### Wtf?\n\nYeah! This is actually a php framework without a real framework. Just a basic\nscheme to start from. You can repurpose for whatever suits you.\n\n#### For who?\n\nFor developers who have had enough with frameworks and want to keep all stuff\nin their hands, in their way.\n\n#### What's included?\n\nSimple url routing for SEO friendly urls. Demo with Bootstrap Narrow jumbotron\ntheme. Google Analytic snippet.\n\n#### Requirements\n\nPHP 5.x Apache2.x mod_rewrite module enabled\n\n#### So, what's it all about?\n\nI'm not going to tell you that frameworks are bad or good. The question is:\nAre these useful or useless for your need? We can also ask whether the project\nneed to be done fast, be dependant on framework, requires same framework\nknowledge from co-worker or post-developer. A lot of webapp developers are in\na rush and have killing deadlines. So frameworks are their salvation. But if\nyou have an opportunity to develop one project at a time with no hurry. You\nwant to be Agile, follow DRY ideology, understand best practices in\napplication designing. To get those you don't need to use frameworks, but\nexperience in good programming. Writing clear code, keeping redundant stuff\naway and being independent makes application to be apprehensible for any co-\nworker and post-developer. So lets stop battling and flooding our applications\nwith frameworks and concentrate on creating pure and well designed\napplications.\n\n> Reusable code is overrated a majority of the time. The focus should be on\n> creating well designed software that is easily maintainable. Much more\n> software can be built in a shorter time frame this way.\n>\n> Mike Mooney The Framework Myth 2010\n\n> If there is one thing more frightening than mapping your way through a maze\n> of twisty little libraries, it\u2019s getting mired in the framework swamp.\n>\n> Mike Taylor PragPub April 2010\n\n> Bottom line: like most things that are sexy in web development right now,\n> the proliferation of development frameworks only leads to complacency,\n> missed opportunities for learning, and the lack of focus.
