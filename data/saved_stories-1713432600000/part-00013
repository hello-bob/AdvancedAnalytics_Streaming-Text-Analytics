If you find yourself getting stuck in a procrastination rut, try practicing self-awareness and deciding what you can do as an alternative.\n  * We often don\u2019t realize how long we have actually been doing something. Abha suggests trying timers, time blocks, and rewards to help. For example, you might reward yourself with five minutes of scrolling on your phone after thirty minutes of work.\n  * There is no one-size-fits-all approach to productivity. If the tool you are trying isn\u2019t working, be honest with yourself and try something else. The Werk Life offers many free resources in addition to planners. Check out their website if you need inspiration on where to start.\n  * Don\u2019t get bogged down in the planning stage. Sometimes you have to say this plan is good enough and move on to executing it.\n  * Not everything is always what it seems on the internet, and if the content you consume makes you feel bad, give yourself the room to step away.\n\n### Find Us\n\n  * Digital Citizen Website: fastmail.com/digitalcitizen.\n  * Check out our blog.\n  * Tweet us: @Fastmail.\n  * Follow us on Mastodon: @fastmail@mastodon.social.\n\n### Review Us\n\nIf you love this show, please leave us a review on Apple Podcasts or wherever\nyou listen to podcasts.

I\u2019m Ricardo\nSignes at Fastmail, the email provider of choice for savvy digital citizens\neverywhere. Here with me is my colleague, Haley Hnatuk.\n\nHaley Hnatuk: Hi, everyone. I\u2019m Haley Hnatuk, Fastmail Senior Podcast\nProducer, Marketing Specialist and the Co-host of Digital Citizen. I wear a\nlot of hats at Fastmail, so staying organized is one of the keys to my\nproductivity. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so excited for today\u2019s guest. Rik, who are you\ngoing to be talking to today?\n\nRicardo Signes: I will be interviewing Abha Chiyedan, who is the founder of\nThe Werk Life, which is a productivity brand focused around practicing healthy\nhabits to help you better manage your time and find balance.\n\nHaley Hnatuk: So we\u2019re about halfway through the year right now. And it\u2019s time\nto kind of retroactively start looking back at some of those resolutions we\nsaid at the beginning of 2024. Rik, what were some of your 2024 New Year\u2019s\nresolutions?\n\nRicardo Signes: Oh, I mean, I finished them all. So I even go through them.\nNo, my main resolution was digging up old projects that I have abandoned and\nfinishing them. And I feel this maybe is a really ill-advised goal. I\nabandoned them once already. And maybe this time, if I abandon them, again,\nit\u2019ll stick. But a lot of that for me boils down to getting a good handle on\nprogramming languages that I haven\u2019t learned yet. One of which is Inform,\nwhich is a language for writing interactive fiction, because I have a couple\nprojects that I started in that and would like to finish. So that\u2019s underway\nand in a few more months, you can see if I have a exciting pieces of\ninteractive fiction for you to quote unquote, enjoy. How\u2019s your year going for\ngoals?\n\nHaley Hnatuk: Yeah, I mean, I feel like I set pretty standard goals. I always\nset a book reading goal every year, and this year, my goal is to read 10\nbooks, which seems pretty achievable, because I just joined a book club. I\nhave my first meeting at the beginning of next month. So hopefully, I can kind\nof catch up on my goal and get those 10 books read before the end of the year.\nAnother goal of mine is to submit more poems. I\u2019m in a poetry class that meets\nevery other Thursday, so I write a lot of poetry, and then I do nothing with\nit. And when I have submitted it places, I\u2019ve had generally positive results.\nSo I\u2019m trying to get more into the rhythm of submitting stuff that I write\nthat I feel good about. And workwise I\u2019m gonna be doing some leadership\ntraining coming up. So completing that is a big goal for 2024.\n\nRicardo Signes: Good luck.\n\nHaley Hnatuk: What are you and Abha going to be talking about today?\n\nRicardo Signes: Well, we\u2019re going to talk about different ways of staying\nproductive, how to avoid procrastination, and how to create boundaries between\nyour professional and personal life. And then at the end of the episode, and\nevery other episode, this season, we will have some takeaways of things that\nyou can actually do to become a better digital citizen. You can find those,\nalso on our website at fastmail.com/digitalcitizen.\n\nRicardo Signes: So today we\u2019re here with Abha Chiyedan. She\u2019s from The Werk\nLife. Abha, could you tell us about yourself and what you do?\n\nAbha Chiyedan: I\u2019m a pretty multi-passionate person. I love to learn a lot of\nthings, love to try new things, and I think that passion is kind of what led\nme to the career path I\u2019m on right now. So I used to work in the corporate\nworld for about seven years before I took The Werk Life full-time. It was my\nside hustle at the time and it has been very rewarding building it from\nscratch and bringing me to where I am now.\n\nRicardo Signes: What is The Werk Life\u2019s mission?\n\nAbha Chiyedan: I started it when I was first transitioning from university to\nthe full-time working world. I found the transition to be difficult because\nnow you are managing your work life and your personal life, hence The Werk\nLife, and so it started as a blog. It was really just a creative outlet, a way\nfor me to very much share my own personal experiences with anyone that might\nbe going through similar things. We\u2019ve definitely evolved a lot since then\nbecause that was back in 2016. I would say over the past few years what we\u2019ve\ndone is really narrowed down our niche to be really focused on different\ntechniques to better manage your time, better manage your wellness, whether\nit\u2019s building a routine or doing something that works for you because you\u2019re\nnot a morning person. We\u2019re trying to really adapt to anyone that struggles\nwith the everyday notion of productivity.\n\nRicardo Signes: Yeah, we\u2019ve talked about productivity a number of times in the\npodcast and I talk about productivity a lot. And I think the thing I\u2019m most\nproductive at is procrastinating. I don\u2019t think of myself as a lazy person. I\nthink I get a lot of stuff done, but I put a lot of stuff off until tomorrow\nthat I could do today, and maybe you can tell me why do I keep doing that.\n\nAbha Chiyedan: I think one of the biggest reasons we all procrastinate is just\ninstant gratification. So, I always use the example of like doing dishes, and\nit\u2019s like sometimes after a long day of work, you made dinner, you\u2019ve got some\ndishes to do. It might just be like one or two, but you\u2019re so tired at that\npoint and you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, do we really want to do this now? I\u2019ll just do it\ntomorrow,\u201d because I\u2019d rather enjoy the benefit right now of relaxing on the\ncouch and just unplugging, unwinding. Whereas the next day when you do it, it\nends up being there\u2019s like another four dishes, whatever it is, it ends up\nbeing way harder.\n\nRicardo Signes: That\u2019s a very real problem for me. I finish my work day, and I\nknow I\u2019ve got a lot of other things to do. But instead I open up my phone and\nI scroll through something forever. And at the end, I don\u2019t feel any\ngratification. So, what can I do to replace that bad habit with something more\nproductive?\n\nAbha Chiyedan: To your point, I don\u2019t think anyone actually spends an hour\nscrolling on their phone and they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, I feel so alive, I feel like,\nyou know, rejuvenated and great.\u201d Most people feel pretty crappy afterwards. I\nthink it\u2019s just knowing how that happened in the first place. I think having\nthe self-awareness of knowing, okay, I do this and then what can I do as an\nalternative? What can I consciously do, whether it\u2019s very tactical, like\nputting your phone in a completely different room so you don\u2019t go to grab it\nor locking your phone up so you can\u2019t access it. I just think you have to get\ndown to those tactical methods.\n\nRicardo Signes: The other extreme that I swing to personally is spending way\ntoo much time on planning. Sometimes I feel like I spend 100% of my time\ngetting ready and I end up leaving 0% to actually do the thing. What other\nadvice do you have for people who struggle with over planning?\n\nAbha Chiyedan: You do not want to get stuck in planning. I think planning is\nso important. It is your blueprint for what you\u2019re going to do. But if you are\njust spending all your time planning, you\u2019re never getting anything done. One\nof the things that I always say is you should really be spending 10% of your\ntime planning, 90% executing. So if you\u2019re looking at those plans and you are\nconstantly revising them, changing them, and you can go back and say, \u201cHow\nmany of these things have I actioned?\u201d, and you haven\u2019t actioned any, that\u2019s\nwhen it\u2019s time to actually get to work. And I think how you action it is you\nhave to like put in that time-blocked work. And we always talk about the\nPomodoro Technique, deep work, just ways to actually remove yourself from all\ndistractions. When you say, I\u2019m working on this one thing on my to-do list for\n25 minutes, taking a five-minute break, 25 minutes, five-minute break, and\njust using techniques like that where you have no other choice but to do it.\n\nRicardo Signes: I\u2019d be curious to hear more about that. I have a Pomodoro\ntimer and I have used it and I feel like I\u2019ve never really gotten to use it\ncorrectly. I use it for things like reading my email. If I have 61 pieces of\nemail since Friday, I set a timer, and I read email until it dings. That seems\ngreat and it gets me through my email, but what do you do if you want to take\nthese time blocks and apply them to some larger plan?\n\nAbha Chiyedan: I think a lot of the time, we don\u2019t realize how much time we\u2019ve\nbeen doing something. So whether it\u2019s scrolling on our phone, we think it\u2019s\nbeen five minutes, but it\u2019s actually been like an hour and a half or we\u2019re\nsitting at our desk getting ready to write a big proposal and we think it\u2019s\nbeen 30 minutes, but it\u2019s actually only been three minutes. So I think having\nthat awareness of time is where the timers and things like that help because\nyou know you\u2019ve actually spent that amount of time on it. But yes, I think\ngetting into the work and getting your mindset and your headspace ready for\nthe deep work is the hard part. I think people have to obviously remove all\ndistractions.\n\nRicardo Signes: To get rid of distractions where I am, sometimes I just change\nmy physical location. So for example, I\u2014 I go sit outside with my laptop after\na really long planning session. Do you thing switching up location is\nimportant for productivity?\n\nAbha Chiyedan: I mean, I think it\u2019s good to change up your environment. I\nthink whether you\u2019re trying to do work, your day-to-day living lifestyle, I\u2019m\na huge believer that you should switch up your environment because I think\nit\u2019s good to have change and I think as humans, we should adapt to changing\nenvironments, right? So whether that means switching up your furniture in your\nroom or working outside for a bit, I think that\u2019s a good idea. I always do\nthat myself. I just think you need to know what type of work is suited for\nwhat kind of environment, and I think sometimes you have like really deep work\nyou need to do and maybe go in a cafe where there\u2019s a bunch of people talking\naround you and it\u2019s distracting, you\u2019re probably not going to get it done.\nBut, opposing thought, maybe if you\u2019re just checking email, it\u2019s something\nmore admin-focused, you could do that in that type of environment.\n\nRicardo Signes: Yeah, going back to our timers, we talk a lot about tools. Do\nyou think there\u2019s a right tool that most people could just use?\n\nAbha Chiyedan: When it comes to your planning, your productivity tools, I\ndon\u2019t think there\u2019s a one-size-fits-all. How you might condense and simplify\nyour information might be very different than me. And some people might prefer\na pure digital approach, some people might prefer pen to paper. I do think you\nwant to do a trial and error and test out different things that work for you.\nI\u2019ve tried out so many different things, and like 90% of them I wasn\u2019t\nconsistent with because the system just didn\u2019t work for me. So I think once\nyou are able to find the thing that truly works for you, I don\u2019t think you\nwill want to deviate from it because it actually is giving you the results.\n\nRicardo Signes: Are there tools that survive novelty, or do we always end up\nmoving from one thing to another to keep ourselves engaged?\n\nAbha Chiyedan: I think it is just finding that right fit. And I think a lot of\ntimes we kind of dabble in a bunch of things and we might use it for a week\nbecause it\u2019s great and it\u2019s exciting, but clearly the methodology, the\ntechnique, it doesn\u2019t resonate with our planning style or our productivity\nneeds. Like, everyone has different things that they\u2019re working on, too,\nright? Like, some people have weekly planning, some people know what they\u2019re\ndoing every single day for the week. Other people, their days are so dynamic,\nit changes hour by hour, and I think getting really clear around what your\npriorities are and how you want to plan on what your style is is what\u2019s key.\nBecause I think to your point, we\u2019ve all done it. We\u2019ve tried every single new\nhot productivity tool that comes out. But then if you\u2019re not sticking to it,\nit\u2019s kind of like the tool isn\u2019t meant to drive your life at the end of the\nday, it\u2019s meant to be something to help you. But if we end up relying on it\ncompletely, that\u2019s also probably a little bit of a break in the system. Like,\nit is on us at the end of the day. Your job is to basically communicate with\nyourself and simplify all the things you need to do. Organize that information\nand be able to execute on it. And that\u2019s actually not an easy task to do\nbecause you have to learn how to communicate with yourself.\n\nRicardo Signes: So it sounds like there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach to\nproductivity planning. When somebody tries out a tool that doesn\u2019t work for\nthem, what question should they be asking themselves when they analyze what\nisn\u2019t working?\n\nAbha Chiyedan: I think, \u201cWhy not?\u201d I think anything in life, if you\u2019re going\nto ditch it and move on, I think it\u2019s fair to just say give yourself some\nclosure as to why. Like, what didn\u2019t work about it because then you can just\n... I think you can learn a bit more about yourself as well as the next thing\nthat you\u2019re looking for. So 100%, I think understanding, okay, how consistent\nwas I with it? Like, was I using it daily, hourly, weekly? How often did I\nneed to use it? So what if I was using it daily but I actually should have\nbeen looking on it every hour? I think are you getting the results you want\nfrom that tool is very important too.\n\nAbha Chiyedan: So even if you\u2019re using, let\u2019s say a planning tool very\nreligiously, but you\u2019re not getting results but the things that you put down\non your to-do list isn\u2019t getting done or whatever it is, right? You\u2019re writing\nthings down, nothing\u2019s happening. Like, that\u2019s not effective either.\n\nRicardo Signes: When you\u2019re putting together material to help show someone how\nto use a tool or planner to make it useful, can you just think about what\u2019s\ngoing to make it useful for them, or do you have to spend time on the cases\nwhere they are going to misuse it in some way?\n\nAbha Chiyedan: 100%. And that\u2019s why a majority of our planners are guided,\nright? Like unlike other planners you see on market where it\u2019s really blank\npages, like, they\u2019re really blank pages that are dated and you kind of create\nyour own format. That\u2019s the approach we\u2019re doing differently. It\u2019s very much,\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to structure this and guide you through it,\u201d and that structure\nthat we\u2019ve created, it\u2019s not for everyone. But for the people that want to\nplan their meals, their exercise, time-block their day, if they know these are\nthings that are important to them or their priorities in their life, we\u2019ve\ncreated the structure for you, you just kind of fill it in as you go.\n\nAbha Chiyedan: We\u2019ve gotten so much feedback on that and one of the things\nthat I heard the most was, \u201cOkay, am I going to be consistent with this\nplanner?\u201d, because I usually use a planner for two weeks and then I never use\nit again. And that was, it was so fascinating to hear this because last year,\nwe launched ... We did a pilot test of paper planners, and I got so many\nmessages from people being like, \u201cIt\u2019s crazy because every year I buy a\nplanner at the beginning of the year and I use it like twice, and I never use\nit again except for this planner. It\u2019s been 10 months, eight months, whatever,\nSeptember and I\u2019m still using it.\u201d So I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s interesting\nbecause that\u2019s like a good fit.\u201d Right? Like, that person clearly resonates\nwith the structure we have. I think it\u2019s finding your system.\n\nRicardo Signes: Just like people use planners to achieve different goals,\npeople also have different ways of emailing. What do you look for in an email\nsystem to let you make sense of all these kinds of requests that are ending up\nin front of you?\n\nAbha Chiyedan: Yeah, so for me, I think email is a very big deal for me as\nwell. Like, I take it very, very seriously in the sense I\u2019m very meticulous\nwith it. Like if you go into my inbox, like everything, there\u2019s folders. It\u2019s\nvery organized and filed. So for me, the biggest thing is, like, when I get an\nemail and we get a lot of them in a day, I need to very quickly and\nefficiently be able to take action on that email. And generally, if I get an\nemail, I am either deleting the email right away, I\u2019m reading it and deleting\nit, I\u2019m reading and actioning it and after I action it, I\u2019m filing it for\nrecall. And so any way that I could quickly do those actions is, like, super\nhelpful for me. So for example, if I\u2019m on my phone and I can just swipe and\ndelete, if I can just drag and drop to file, like it makes it so much easier\nfor, like, your compound against like 100 emails having to click four times to\nfile an email or it\u2019s this very simple thing, but I think it actually adds so\nmuch efficiency because it makes it so much faster.\n\nRicardo Signes: Yeah. However, having a phone in your pocket and your\nnotifications always on can lead to a different problem, a lack of work-life\nbalance. How do you create boundaries between your personal and professional\nlife?\n\nAbha Chiyedan: I think sometimes, you know, people force, like, turnoff from\nwork and I\u2014 I\u2019m not saying, like, you have to work 24/7. But if you like what\nyou\u2019re doing, like, if it\u2019s enjoyable and it\u2019s challenging in the right ways\nand you\u2019re not stressed by it and if it\u2019s not having a negative impact on your\nmental health, then I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with, \u201cMaybe my days\nare a bit longer now,\u201d but there\u2019s also a lot of freedom in there. If I want\nto take a 30-minute break and go for a walk, I don\u2019t have to worry about\nchecking messages to make sure no one\u2019s like, \u201cCan you send this report to me\nwithin 30 minutes?\u201d, type of thing. So there\u2019s a lot of freedom that comes\nwith it, too. And I think as much as it\u2019s okay, you now have this thing that\nyou did it in your free time, now you do it all the time, your free time kind\nof gets dabbled into it. But I think I\u2019m now just like, \u201cOkay, the next thing,\nthe next,\u201d I\u2019ve just liked that. So, I think it just gives more time for\ncreativity and room for new projects and everything like that.\n\nRicardo Signes: To state the obvious, there\u2019s a lot of stuff on the internet,\na lot of content, and even just limiting things way down to talk about\nproductivity content, it\u2019s still a lot. So, what did you have to do to break\nthrough the rest of the signal and get attention paid to what you wanted to\ncommunicate?\n\nAbha Chiyedan: There is a lot. You know, you\u2019re totally right. And I think\nwhere I was lucky was with TikTok. I started TikTok in 2021, so that was\npretty early, and I think we were like one of the first to start sharing\nproductivity tips on TikTok. I\u2019m not saying we were the very first, there was\nalready stuff on there-\n\nRicardo Signes: Sure.\n\nAbha Chiyedan: But it wasn\u2019t as saturated as it is now where there\u2019s tons and\nmillions and millions of views on every activity hashtag. It\u2019s not like that.\nI think we had a very unique voice and the way that content is presented,\nlike, on The Werk Life isn\u2019t always so typical and I think a lot of times\npeople say, okay, like, follow trends, put in the trending music, do what\neveryone else is doing. And I think that works to an extent, but like you\nsaid, there\u2019s so much on it. You just start to see the same thing over and\nover again. A big thing for The Werk Life that really, I would say, made\nthings take off was the whole pen to paper thing. And so things like that,\njust taking a different approach to what you see as you\u2019re scrolling, what\u2019s\ngoing to make you stop and be like, this is interesting, let me learn more, is\nwhat I think really worked for us.\n\nRicardo Signes: While presumably you\u2019re still successful on TikTok. Have you\ntaken those lessons and applied them everywhere else, or have you had to learn\nhow the different media you work in want different things?\n\nAbha Chiyedan: There\u2019s definitely some overlap. Like generally a video that\ndoes well on TikTok, will do decent on other ones, but it\u2019s not necessarily\nalways going to do the same. Like, you can\u2019t guarantee that one performs great\nand it performs everywhere, but it really has opened up just a lot of\nopportunity to connect with, like, The Werk Life audience more. So a big thing\nfor us that we also have, we have a lot of planners and stuff like that. We\nhave a lot of free resources, so if you go to the werklife.com/free, we have a\nbunch of different templates, just daily planners, weekly planners, all of\nthat that people can just download, print off, use on their iPad, whatever,\nand it\u2019s just our way of being like, here\u2019s a free resource, help you stay\norganized. We\u2019ve had over 35,000 people download those, and that was like a\nhuge impact just from a couple of videos that we did that went viral. People\nsaying, \u201cOkay, do you have any tools?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s linked in our bio.\u201d So yeah, to\nyour point, does everything perform across different channels? Not\nnecessarily, but you take those learnings and I think you have to take it a\nbit further because social media is not the whole business, right? Like, it\u2019s\nan avenue. It\u2019s a channel to talk to people, but you want to funnel them in\nand actually have a one-on-one conversation. And we do that through our\nnewsletter and through other forms of media as well.\n\nRicardo Signes: So I\u2019ve looked at the planners, and they look good. But also\nthey reminded me of a time very early in my productivity journey, my first\njob. I was the guy who was walking around the office, this like half-sized\nclipboard and this little daily planner printed on it. And I did everything on\npaper. Do you do your own work on paper, or on your ipad, or electronically or\nwhat?\n\nAbha Chiyedan: I still need certain things, but day-to-day life planning, I\u2019ve\nbeen using The Werk Life\u2019s 2023 planner in paper format. But there are certain\nthings that, like for example, that you wouldn\u2019t necessarily plan every day,\nbut you have resources of, like, our nutrition planner where I have just stock\nof all of the recipes. Whenever I want to recall a recipe, I just go onto my\niPad and I see it there. So it\u2019s like very organized information for different\nniches in your life, and I think it\u2019s knowing where everything is that\u2019s\nreally important because you don\u2019t want to get overwhelmed.\n\nRicardo Signes: The nice thing about sticky notes for me is that they don\u2019t\nfollow me home. So is it harder for you to balance productivity at work with\ntime for yourself when both of those things are happening in the same space?\n\nAbha Chiyedan: I do think a big part of it is like to get very deep, but also\nvery not deep at the end of the day is like we\u2019re all human, we\u2019re not here\nfor long. All we can do is do our best, but that\u2019s not all we are, right? And\nI\u2019m\u2014 I\u2019ve always known that, like, since I was a child that it\u2019s do your best,\ndo what you can, but nothing truly defines you. Like, you have to know who you\nare beyond the work that you\u2019re doing, beyond what\u2019s trending.\n\nRicardo Signes: Yeah, I agree. We\u2019ve talked about how productivity is\npersonally satisfying to both of us. But many people work jobs where they have\nlike corporate expectations of productivity being forced on them, and that can\nlead to feeling less, rather than more, satisfied with their work. So, what\nview do you think people can take to feel more empower at work and less bogged\ndown by corporate expectation?\n\nAbha Chiyedan: That\u2019s really hard because it is very dependent on your\nenvironment, right? And when you are in a position where you have a leader\nthat\u2019s kind of forcing that down your throat, telling you you have to act a\ncertain way, it\u2019s like it\u2019s obviously not the right fit. And I know that not\neveryone has the luxury of, I don\u2019t like my job, I\u2019m going to quit it and move\non. So I wouldn\u2019t preach that because I actually don\u2019t ... I\u2019ve been in that\nposition where you can\u2019t do that. So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the solution. I\nthink having a real sense of self is really important and not getting so\ncaught up in what other people are telling you to do. And what I mean is I\nthink it\u2019s very easy to go down the corporate rabbit hole of, \u201cOkay, this is\nlike so important. Everyone, work all weekend, do this thing,\u201d when really it\nends up getting dismissed, no one ends up working on it.\n\nAbha Chiyedan: I\u2019ve experienced that so many times where people put so much\nemphasis on something, it doesn\u2019t even end up being that big of a deal. So I\nthink creating boundaries is very important. And when it\u2019s times like that, if\nyou start to sense that, I think don\u2019t wait too long. Maybe start seeing what\nother career opportunities you have. So I\u2019m not saying quit your job and go do\nwhatever you want, but if you\u2019re aware that there\u2019s not a fit and it\u2019s not\nworking for you, how can you be proactive to understand what do I want to do\nnext and how am I going to get there.\n\nRicardo Signes: Yeah, for sure. But there\u2019s one last question we usually ask\neveryone who\u2019s on, and it\u2019s about digital citizenship. What do you think is\nthe actual advice you would give individuals on how to be better digital\ncitizens and have a healthy online life?\n\nAbha Chiyedan: I think what comes with the internet, you have to take the good\nand like filter out the bad. There\u2019s so much that happens and it\u2019s very easy\nto go down a rabbit hole of like negativity and bad things. Whereas I think if\nyou instead focus your energy on content that you consume that is actually\nhelpful or educational or whatever it is, like, you will probably feel better\nas a human. So I think you have to be very conscious about what you consume\nand make sure you\u2019re doing things that feel good to you and are right for you\nbecause the last thing you want is to, like, destroy your mental health as a\nresult of the things you see. And I think that actually happens a lot more\nthan we realize for people.\n\nAbha Chiyedan: I mean, I think when you have your own business, whether it\u2019s\nonline or not, I think in the online space, it\u2019s important to just learn as\nmuch as you can. I think what sets people apart is your skillset. And I think\nwhether you want to be a content creator, a video editor, a writer, there\u2019s so\nmany options to have a business online nowadays, and I think that\u2019s amazing.\nBut I think you need to understand what type of work it is that you\u2019re the\nbest at. And I think you learn that by trying a bunch of different things. So\nI would say if you\u2019ve always been curious about it, but you\u2019re hesitant, just\ntry. You really have nothing to lose because there are millions and millions\nof people doing things and, like, no one really caress what people are doing.\nSo just do your best, learn new skills, hone in on the skill that you feel\nlike you\u2019re the best at, and then just go full force with it because I think\nit\u2019s just going to continue to grow, like everything in the online space.\n\nRicardo Signes: Great. I\u2019m always down with advice, that\u2019s \u201clearn more stuff.\u201d\nThat\u2019s my mantra. I hope you learn something new about productivity, or were\ninspired to try a new way of staying organized.\n\nHaley Hnatuk: Yeah, another great conversation, Rik. I\u2019m interested to hear\nmore about the productivity tools that you use in your life.\n\nRicardo Signes: Yeah, for me productivity tools come and go, which I talk\nabout a lot things that have stuck are pieces of software that I\u2019ve written\nmyself, which is hard to recommend to other people. But a lot of those are\nbuilt on top of Remember The Milk, which is I mean, it\u2019s another to do list\napplication. It\u2019s the one that has never offended me so much that I stopped\nusing it. And that is high praise. I\u2019ve been using it for 10,15, a long time.\nAnd Notion, which I have been using Notion more and more. And....\n\nHaley Hnatuk: Shoutout to Notion.\n\nRicardo Signes: Yeah.\n\nHaley Hnatuk: We love Notion.\n\nRicardo Signes: ... It\u2019s terrific. We use it at work. And I have been using it\nto organize my last few trips for fun and just movie marathons at the house.\nIt\u2019s just it gets out of my way and helped me get stuff done. I feel pretty\ngood about it. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to last. But so far, I\u2019m still using\nit. What about you?\n\nHaley Hnatuk: Yeah, I mean, a thread and all of that and the conversation you\nhad with Abha is finding what works best for you. I talked in another episode\nthis season, about the way that I use labels to organize my emails. I\u2019m\nsomebody who color really matters to me and my productivity practice. And I\u2019m\nsomebody with a very color coded calendar, so many labels in my Linear, which\nis the task management system that we use at Fastmail, and labels in my inbox.\nI also do use a paper calendar and a paper meal prep calendar as well for to-\ndo\u2019s, but for bigger projects and things that have a lot of moving parts. I\nalso love Notion. I use Notion in my personal life and in my professional\nlife. Moving back to what you talked about with Abha today, what do you think\nthe key productivity takeaways were of your conversation with her?\n\nRicardo Signes: Sure, well, first one goes back to what we were just talking\nabout, right? This, you got to accept there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach to\nproductivity. If something doesn\u2019t work for you, just be honest with yourself\nand try something else. You can\u2019t look at one tool and say, \u201cThis is the tool\nthat\u2019s gonna work for me because it works for somebody else.\u201d All this stuff\nis about who you are and what works for you. Accept that, right? Find the tool\nis going to work for you. Secondly, don\u2019t get bogged down in planning. This is\nanother thing that\u2019s come up a few times this season. Planning is great. It\u2019s\nnice to have a plan that you can execute. But the point of a plan is executing\nit. It\u2019s not the plan itself. Sometimes you have to say this plan is good\nenough, and then get to work even if the plan could be better. Because what\nyou want to do is be done with a plan and throw it away. And finally, on the\ninternet, you don\u2019t need to eat everything that gets put in front of you. If\nthe content that you\u2019re taking in makes you feel bad, it\u2019s okay to stop.\nAlright, and that content can be anything. It can be the news. It can be\npeople telling you how to be more productive when that makes you feel bad.\nAnything, right? The stuff that you are taking in, it\u2019s okay to feel bad about\nsome things, but don\u2019t just consume everything no matter how it makes you\nfeel.\n\nHaley Hnatuk: Well, we hope that you can take these actionable steps towards\nbeing a better digital citizen.\n\nRicardo Signes: We\u2019re gonna see again in two weeks for conversation about\nanother exciting topic.\n\nRicardo Signes: Thanks for listening to Digital Citizen.
