By building the library in Rust from scratch\nbased on the delta lake protocol, the delta-rs community immediately benefited\nfrom memory safety, a highly efficient compiler, and high performance when\nprocessing large amounts of data simultaneously. However, since Python was\nalso extremely popular within the data community with many data processing\nframeworks available, providing native binding to its ecosystem was key to\nmaking the adoption of the library easier. Besides, it provides a doorway for\nthe community to learn Rust. In this talk, Florian will cover briefly what\ndelta-rs is and its implementation. Then he will focus on how combining Rust\nand Python code bases to have the best of two worlds levaraging pyo3 library.\nThis session will provide practical and useful ideas for building a Python\napplication on top of Rust's blazing-fast and memory-efficient execution.\n\nShow less Show more\n\nTranscript\n\nFollow along using the transcript.\n\n### The Linux Foundation\n\n180K subscribers\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\n## Transcript\n\nNaN / NaN\n\n# Sponsored Session: Building Python Binding for the Delta Lake Library in\nRust - Florian Valeye\n\nThe Linux Foundation\n\nThe Linux Foundation\n\n180K subscribers\n\n<__slot-el>\n\n<__slot-el>\n\nDownload\n\n188 views 7 months ago\n\n188 views \u2022 Oct 4, 2023\n\n#### License\n\nCreative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed)\n\nShow less\n\nSponsored Session: Building Python Binding for the Delta Lake Library in Rust\n- Florian Valeye, Back Market Delta-rs is a native Rust library for Delta\nLake, a Linux Foundation project. ......more\n\n...more\n\nTranscript\n\nFollow along using the transcript.\n\n### The Linux Foundation\n\n180K subscribers\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\nVideos\n\nAbout\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\n#### License\n\nCreative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed)\n\nShow less\n\n# Sponsored Session: Building Python Binding for the Delta Lake Library in\nRust - Florian Valeye\n\n188 views188 views\n\nOct 4, 2023\n\nDownload\n\n### Delta-rs, Apache Arrow, Polars, WASM: Is Rust the Future of Analytics?\n\nDatabricks\n\nDatabricks\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n7K views 9 months ago\n\n", "frontpage": false}
