A tire recycling company is making the rubber meet the road,\nrecycling old tires into a material that is used to reinforce asphalt for road\nconstruction.\n\nhttps://p.dw.com/p/4euyL\n\nCopy link\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndia is the world's third-largest car market, but tire waste is a growing\nproblem. As of 2025, manufacturers and importers will have to recycle all of\ntheir end-of-life tires, and there are calls for the government to support\ngreen technologies.\n\n\"It's important that we don't dump them in landfills as that could lead to an\ninfestation of pests,\" Krishna Propoorna from the India Institute of\nTechnology Tirupati told DW. \"Even if you incinerate [them], the incineration\nof tires can be very detrimental to the environment. Burying tires can pollute\nthe environment, and putting them in landfills will also damage the\necosystem.\"\n\nHowever, the town of Vada, located 75 kilometers outside Mumbai, is home to\none of India's leading tire recyclers. The company grinds up tire waste to\nproduce a material used to reinforce asphalt for road construction. It says it\nhas recycled 6 million used tires for this purpose over the past decade.\n\nRecycling tires into road-building material, called Crumb Rubber Modified\nBitumen, is extremely energy-intensive because of the high temperatures needed\nto process the rubber. However, it generates considerably lower carbon dioxide\nemissions than regular asphalt and makes the road more durable.\n\nSend us your feedback\n\nYour feedback\n\nSkip next section Similar stories from India\n\n## Similar stories from India\n\n### India: Climate change leaves Dehli's urban poor in the cold\n\nClimate change has also brought cold weather to northern India.
