A green head showed up next to the\nPreCheck logo on my digital boarding pass:\n\nWhen I got to LAX, I walked up the CLEAR kiosks, as I always do, and found a\nline of three people in front of me. A CLEAR agent walked up and scanned my\nboarding pass. She stopped for a moment and then said, \u201cYou have Touchless ID.\nIt will be faster if you go over there [pointing to a special lane next to the\nPreCheck lane].\u201d\n\nI said thank you and walked over.\n\nAn airport agent verified my boarding pass to ensure I was in the proper line,\nthen told me to walk through.\n\nI walked up to the TSA agent and stopped, staring into the camera. A few\nseconds later, he told me, \u201cGo ahead. You\u2019re going to go.\u201d\n\nIt was that easy! No boarding pass. No ID.\n\nIn other words, this will put CLEAR out of business if it becomes more\nwidespread becuase it is so much more efficient than having your eyes scanned\nor fingerprints taken, then boarding pass scanned, then having to show it to\nan airport TSA officer.\n\nWhat is TSA Touchless ID exactly?\n\n> TSA is using facial identification to verify a passenger\u2019s identity at its\n> security checkpoints using the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)\n> Traveler Verification Service (TVS), which creates a secure biometric\n> template of a passenger\u2019s live facial image taken at the checkpoint and\n> matches it against a gallery of templates of pre-staged photos that the\n> passenger previously provided to the government (e.g., U.S. Passport or\n> Visa).\n\nMeanwhile, a bipartisan group of US Senators has urged caution on this\nprogram.\n\n> The potential for misuse of this technology extends far beyond airport\n> security checkpoints. Once Americans become accustomed to government facial\n> recognition scans, it will be that much easier for the government to scan\n> citizens\u2019 faces everywhere, from entry into government buildings to passive\n> surveillance on public property like parks, schools, and sidewalks.\n\nI think those concerns are valid, though I also think the ship has sailed in\nterms of privacy.\n\nIn any case, it was a very easy breeze through security yesterday.\n\nI didn\u2019t even set off the machine!\n\n> Read More: I Got \u201cFelt Up\u201d By The TSA After Body Scanner Detects Suspicious\n> Package\n\nFarmer John Busted For Trying To Sneak Beer\n\nFrom Lounge In To-Go Cofee Cup\n\nRead More\n\n### About Author\n\n##### Matthew Klint\n\nMatthew is an avid traveler who calls Los Angeles home.

I see it in Vegas and it\u2019s no faster\nthan regular PreCheck.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s faster in other cities but as you said, this could put them out of\nbusiness.\n\n     * FNT Delta Diamond Reply\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 5:18 pm\n\nThe best lanes in Las Vegas and Denver are FIRST-CLASS/PREMIUM. Seldom used\nand not really promoted.\n\n  2. Jan Reply\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 2:21 pm\n\nLooks like the same tech that Global Entry arrivals have?\n\nI would cry about invasion of privacy, but then again I\u2019m sure my smartphone\nhas taken endless amounts of phots/scans of my face already. Welp\n\n  3. Travelgirl Reply\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 2:28 pm\n\nI\u2019ve had CLEAR since it was originally launched and do not plan on renewing.\nTSA Pre-check is now faster even without touchless ID. The last 2 times I\u2019ve\ntraveled, I got out of the CLEAR lane and went to the Pre-Check lane and was\nthrough quicker than if I remained in the CLEAR line. They no longer provide\nvalue.\n\n  4. Jorge Reply\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 2:40 pm\n\nThis is how Nexus/(Global Entry?) works when going from Montr\u00e9al to the US.\nFace scan and you are good to go.\n\n  5. Grumpy1k Reply\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 2:47 pm\n\nI do not trust Clear. The reason: in at least one past bankruptcy suit Clear\nclaimed your biometric data as their asset. In other words they own your\nbiometric data.\n\n     * D.A. Reply\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 6:58 pm\n\nI fully agree. Where did my pre-BK paid membership data go when they went BK?\nNow that Clear is owned by the airlines, I trust them even less. Adding in the\nfact that California wants to ban Clear, their value proposition is becoming\nless \u201cclear\u201d.\n\n  6. John A. D. Needham Reply\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 3:14 pm\n\nI used CLEAR about 6 weeks ago at JFK en route to Singapore. It was a complete\nwaste of time \u2013 lots of machines to try to get new customers and very little\nservice for existing customers such as I. I think they are desperately trying\nto hook other customers as their market model dies.\n\n  7. Michael Reply\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 5:16 pm\n\nI have no problem with this....I\u2019ve had no issues with TSA precheck and had\nthe same experience as Matthew recently at LAX. It was easy, quick and\nefficient. Three adjectives you don\u2019t normally associate with the government.\n\n  8. FNT Delta Diamond Reply\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 5:20 pm\n\nThe problem with BOTH Clear and Precheck is the new machines at most airports\nwhere you don\u2019t take anything out make going through normal security \u2013\u2013\nassuming there is a backlog of passengers waiting to show their ID \u2014 just as\nquick as Pre and Clear.\n\n  9. Kurt Reply\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 5:24 pm\n\nDelta is trialing this in NYC calling it \u201cDigital ID.\u201d I was amazed how simple\nit was. Didn\u2019t need to present anything. The only limitation for this (at\nleast for Delta) is that you have to have a valid passport in your loyalty\nprogram, but other than that it was super simple. If this gets expanded, CLEAR\nis done. It\u2019s already super hard for me to justify a whopping $180 a year as\nis. With this, forget about it.\n\n  10. derek Reply\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 5:29 pm\n\nGlobal Entry is now creepy. Look into the camera and you are free to go\nafterwards.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t know is where can I declare if I am bringing a sausage or lots of\npurchases? I didn\u2019t have either but I don\u2019t know where to go if I had. The\nregular line?\n\n     * Alert Reply\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 6:33 pm\n\n@derek ... why would anyone bring a sausage from Africa or Brazil ?\n\n  11. BHN Reply\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 6:08 pm\n\nWhat a laugh. The House and Senate pass a bill for private security screening\nfor congresspersons\u2014so they won\u2019t have to stand in line with the plebeians\u2014but\ndecry methods to make security more efficient and convenient for the masses.\n\n  12. Max Reply\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 6:26 pm\n\nI am more than eager for this to roll out. I am a huge fan of biometric\nboarding (it\u2019s so much faster). It seems like previous innovations\u2013like\ndigital licenses\u2013have been problematic. And I think we would all like\nconsistency: Do I need to show my ID? Boarding card? It\u2019s all over the place\nright now.\n\nCLEAR paved the way for this, but it\u2019s not an anachronism. They used to have\ncharming, friendly staff. They were eager to chat, say hello, but now that\u2019s\nover. On my past few trips, I have skipped the CLEAR lane because it was too\nlong. One would think that they would be working like mad to offer a better\nproduct, but they seem to have given up.\n\n     * FNT Delta Diamond Reply\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 6:34 pm\n\nThe worst part about Clear is about 40% of the time in the last year I\u2019ve had\nto show ID, which defeats the purpose of Clear. For years I never was got\npulled aside for a secondary check.\n\n  13. Kendrick Reply\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 7:12 pm\n\nThis is now pretty much in use for everyone in TSA Pre departing BOS.

PolishKnight Reply\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 7:16 pm\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even set off the machine!\u201d\n\nThat surprises me considering how \u201cexcited\u201d you were after this worked... \ud83d\ude42\n\n  15. HighlySuspicious Reply\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 7:37 pm\n\nNot enough information in this post, in the news, or from the TSA (surprise!)\nabout how the data is stored and used to make an informed decision.\n\nProblem with biometrics isn\u2019t about how it\u2019s captured and used and by whom.\nThe problem is that it cannot be changed. Lose your password? Change it.\nIdentity stolen? Change your SSN (I know it\u2019s difficult). Change/move/close\nbank accounts if compromised.\n\nNo one takes a picture of your face or fingerprints and uses them in a raw\nmanner to identify you; they are all digitized. I\u2019m not aware of the ins and\nouts of any data format standardization, but your fingerprints will always\nremain your fingerprints, your irises will always remain your irises. They\nwill forever be able to be abused by bad actors if compromised. THAT is why I\nalways opt out of these measure that don\u2019t even save you time.\n\n     * Matthew Klint Reply\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 7:38 pm\n\nI\u2019ll see what I can find out.\n\n  16.
