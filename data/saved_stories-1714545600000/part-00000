Ver was\narrested this weekend in Spain based on the U.S. criminal charges. The United\nStates will seek Ver\u2019s extradition to stand trial in the United States.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Ver formerly of Santa Clara, California, owned\nMemoryDealers.com Inc. and Agilestar.com Inc., two companies that sold\ncomputer and networking equipment. Starting in 2011, Ver allegedly began\nacquiring bitcoins for himself and his companies. He also allegedly avidly\npromoted bitcoins, even obtaining the moniker \u201cBitcoin Jesus.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 4, 2014, Ver allegedly obtained citizenship in St. Kitts and Nevis and\nshortly thereafter renounced his U.S. citizenship in a process known as\nexpatriation. As a result of his expatriation, Ver allegedly was required\nunder U.S. law to file tax returns that reported capital gains from the\nconstructive sale of his world-wide assets, including the bitcoins, and to\nreport the fair market value of his assets. He was also allegedly required to\npay a tax \u2013 referred to as an \u201cexit tax\u201d \u2013 on those capital gains. By Feb. 4,\n2014, Ver and his companies allegedly owned approximately 131,000 bitcoins\nthat traded on several large exchanges for around $871 each. MemoryDealers and\nAgilestar allegedly held approximately 73,000 of those bitcoins.\n\nVer allegedly hired a law firm to assist him with his expatriation and to\nprepare his expatriation-related tax returns. Ver also allegedly hired an\nappraiser to value his two companies. Ver allegedly provided or caused to be\nprovided false or misleading information to the law firm and appraiser that\nconcealed the true number of bitcoins he and his companies owned. As a result,\nthe law firm allegedly prepared and filed false tax returns that substantially\nundervalued the two companies and their 73,000 bitcoins and did not report\nthat Ver owned any bitcoins personally.\n\nThe indictment further alleges that by June 2017, Ver\u2019s two companies\ncontinued to own approximately 70,000 bitcoins. Around that time, Ver\nallegedly took possession of those bitcoins and in November 2017 sold tens of\nthousands of them on cryptocurrency exchanges for approximately $240 million\nin cash. Even though Ver was not then a U.S. citizen, he was still legally\nrequired to report to the IRS and pay tax on certain distributions such as\ndividends from MemoryDealers and Agilestar, which were U.S. corporations. Ver\nallegedly concealed from his accountant that he had received and sold\nMemoryDealers\u2019 and Agilestar\u2019s bitcoins that year. As a result, Ver\u2019s 2017\nindividual income tax return did not report any gain or pay any tax related to\nthe distribution of MemoryDealers\u2019 and Agilestar\u2019s bitcoins to him.\n\nIn total, Ver is alleged to have caused a loss to the IRS of at least $48\nmillion.\n\nActing Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg of the Justice\nDepartment\u2019s Tax Division and U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada for the Central\nDistrict of California made the announcement.\n\nIRS Criminal Investigation's cybercrimes unit is investigating the case.\n\nAssistant Chief Matthew J. Kluge and Trial Attorney Peter J. Anthony of the\nJustice Department\u2019s Tax Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney James. C. Hughes\nfor the Central District of California are prosecuting the case.\n\nAn indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent\nuntil proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\n\nVer Indictment.pdf\n\nUpdated April 30, 2024\n\nTopic\n\nTax\n\nComponent\n\nTax Division\n\nPress Release Number: 24-533\n\n## Related Content\n\nPress Release\n\nOhio Man Sentenced for Tax Fraud Conspiracy\n\nAn Ohio man was sentenced today to one year and one day in prison for\nconspiring to defraud the United States.\n\nApril 30, 2024\n\nPress Release\n\nCalifornia Man Pleads Guilty to Employment Tax Violations\n\nA California man pleaded guilty to failing to pay over employment taxes\nwithheld from the wages of his company\u2019s employees.\n\nApril 30, 2024\n\nPress Release\n\nMaryland Payroll Company Owner Pleads Guilty to Employment Tax Crimes and\nEmbezzling from Employees\u2019 401(k) Plans\n\nA Maryland woman pleaded guilty to failing to pay employment taxes to the IRS\nand embezzling from an employee benefit plan.\n\nApril 26, 2024\n\n## Archived Press Releases\n\nArchived News\n\nPara Not\u00edcias en Espa\u00f1ol\n\n  * Office of Public Affairs U.S. Department of Justice 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington DC 20530\n\n  * Office of Public Affairs Direct Line 202-514-2007\n\nDepartment of Justice Main Switchboard 202-514-2000\n\n  * Signup for Email Updates Social Media\n\n    * twitter\n    * facebook\n    * youtube\n    * instagram\n    * linkedin\n\n  * About\n  * Archives\n  * FOIA\n\n  * Accessibility\n  * Legal Policies & Disclaimers\n  * Privacy\n  * For Employees\n\n  * Office of the Inspector General\n  * No FEAR Act Data\n  * Vulnerability Disclosure\n\n  * Espa\u00f1ol\n  * Vote.gov\n\nHave a question about Government Services?\n\n  * Contact USA.gov\n\nTop\n\n", "frontpage": false}
