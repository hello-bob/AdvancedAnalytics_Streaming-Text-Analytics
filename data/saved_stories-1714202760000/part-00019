12, 2024 in San Rafael,\nCalifornia.\n\nJustin Sullivan | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nThe last batch of inflation news that Federal Reserve officials will see\nbefore their policy meeting next week is in, and none of it is very good.\n\nIn the aggregate, Commerce Department indexes that the Fed relies on for\ninflation signals showed prices continuing to climb at a rate still\nconsiderably higher than the central bank\u2019s 2% annual goal, according to\nseparate reports this week.\n\nWithin that picture came several salient points: An abundance of money still\nsloshing through the financial system is giving consumers lasting buying\npower. In fact, shoppers are spending more than they\u2019re taking in, a situation\nneither sustainable nor disinflationary. Finally, consumers are dipping into\nsavings to fund those purchases, creating a precarious scenario, if not now\nthen down the road.\n\nPut it all together, and it adds up to a Fed likely to be cautious and not in\nthe mood anytime soon to start cutting interest rates.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO5:3505:35\n\nThings went the wrong way for the Fed in the first quarter, says Evercore\nISI\u2019s Krishna Guha\n\nSquawk Box\n\n\u201cJust spending a lot of money is creating demand, it\u2019s creating stimulus. With\nunemployment under 4%, it shouldn\u2019t be that surprising that prices aren\u2019t\u201d\ngoing down, said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.\n\u201cSpending numbers aren\u2019t going down anytime soon. So you might have a sticky\ninflation scenario.\u201d\n\nIndeed, data the Bureau of Economic Analysis released Friday indicated that\nspending outpaced income in March, as it has in three of the past four months,\nwhile the personal savings rate plunged to 3.2%, its lowest level since\nOctober 2022.\n\nAt the same time, the personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed\u2019s\nkey measure in determining inflation pressures, moved up to 2.7% in March when\nincluding all items, and held at 2.8% for the vital core measure that takes\nout more volatile food and energy prices.\n\nA day earlier, the department reported that annualized inflation in the first\nquarter ran at a 3.7% core rate in the first quarter in total, and 3.4% on the\nheadline basis. That came as real gross domestic product growth slowed to a\n1.6% pace, well below the consensus estimate.\n\n## Danger scenarios\n\nThe stubborn inflation data raised several ominous specters, namely that the\nFed may have to keep rates elevated for longer than it or financial markets\nwould like, threatening the hoped-for soft economic landing.\n\nThere\u2019s an even more chilling threat that should inflation persist central\nbankers may have to not only consider holding rates where they are but also\ncontemplate future hikes.\n\n\u201cFor now, it means the Fed\u2019s not going to be cutting, and if [inflation]\ndoesn\u2019t come down, the Fed\u2019s either going to have to hike at some point or\nkeep rates higher for longer,\u201d said LaVorgna, who was chief economist for the\nNational Economic Council under former President Donald Trump. \u201cDoes that\nultimately give us the hard landing?\u201d\n\nThe inflation problem in the U.S. today first emerged in 2022, and had\nmultiple sources.\n\nAt the beginning of the flare-up, the issues came largely from supply chain\ndisruptions that Fed officials thought would go away once shippers and\nmanufacturers had the chance to catch up as pandemic restrictions eased.\n\nBut even with the Covid economic crisis well in the rearview mirror, Congress\nand the Biden administration continue to spend lavishly, with the budget\ndeficit at 6.2% of GDP at the end of 2023. That\u2019s the highest outside of the\nCovid years since 2012 and a level generally associated with economic\ndownturns, not expansions.\n\nOn top of that, a still-bustling labor market, in which job openings\noutnumbered available workers at one point by a 2 to 1 margin and are still at\nabout 1.4 to 1, also helped keep wage pressures high.\n\nNow, even with demand shifting back from goods to services, the normal state\nof the U.S. economy, inflation remains elevated and is confounding the Fed\u2019s\nefforts to slow demand.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO1:5001:50\n\nWeak growth and surging inflation is a bad combo for the Dow, says Jim Cramer\n\nMad Money with Jim Cramer\n\nFed officials had thought inflation would ease this year as housing costs\nsubsided. While most economists still expect an influx of supply to pull down\nshelter-related prices, other areas have cropped up.\n\nFor instance, core PCE services inflation excluding housing \u2014 a relatively new\nwrinkle in the inflation equation nicknamed \u201csupercore\u201d \u2014 is running at a 5.6%\nannualized rate over the past three months, according to Mike Sanders, head of\nfixed income at Madison Investments.\n\nDemand, which the Fed\u2019s rate hikes were supposed to quell, has remained\nrobust, helping drive inflation and signaling that the central bank may not\nhave as much power as it thinks to bring down the pace of price increases.\n\n\u201cIf inflation remains higher, the Fed will be faced with the difficult choice\nof pushing the economy into a recession, abandoning its soft-landing scenario,\nor tolerating inflation higher than 2%,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cTo us, accepting\nhigher inflation is the more prudent option.\u201d\n\n## Worries about a hard landing\n\nThus far, the economy has managed to avoid broader damage from the inflation\nproblem, though there are some notable cracks.\n\nCredit delinquencies have hit their highest level in a decade, and there\u2019s a\ngrowing unease on Wall Street that there\u2019s more volatility to come.\n\nInflation expectations also are on the rise, with the closely watched\nUniversity of Michigan consumer sentiment survey showing one- and five-year\ninflation expectations respectively at annual rates of 3.2% and 3%, their\nhighest since November 2023.\n\nNo less a source than JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon this week vacillated from\ncalling the U.S. economic boom \u201cunbelievable\u201d on Wednesday to a day letter\ntelling The Wall Street Journal that he\u2019s worried all the government spending\nis creating inflation that is more intractable than what is currently\nappreciated.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s driving a lot of this growth, and that will have other consequences\npossibly down the road called inflation, which may not go away like people\nexpect,\u201d Dimon said. \u201cSo I look at the range of possible outcomes. You can\nhave that soft landing. I\u2019m a little more worried that it may not be so soft\nand inflation may not go quite the way people expect.\u201d\n\nDimon estimated that markets are pricing in the odds of a soft landing at 70%.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s half that,\u201d he said.\n\n## Don\u2019t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO\n\n  * Friday\u2019s biggest analyst calls: Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Snap, Intel, Western Digital and more\n  * Here\u2019s where to invest $1 million right now, according to the pros\n  * Forget Nvidia: Morgan Stanley says Intel\u2019s much-hyped AI chip will boost 3 global stocks\n  * These 5 stocks will power the AI revolution as data centers spread and electricity demand doubles, says Bank of America\n  * Earnings playbook: Your guide to trading a huge week of reports, including Meta Platforms\n\nTV\n\nClosing Bell: OvertimeWATCH LIVEWATCH IN THE APP\n\nUP NEXT | Fast Money 05:00 pm ETListen\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
