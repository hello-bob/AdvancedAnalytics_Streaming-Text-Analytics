We actually don\u2019t ask, we just provide\nthe image, but I can think of a few reasons...\n\n  * it is an easy way to use a modern curl version in a system that otherwise ships an ancient version. So many people are stuck on legacy distros with ancient curl versions.\n  * it is an easy way to make use of a consistent fixed version from many places independently of what particular curl versions those systems otherwise can offer\n  * CI jobs\n  * other elaborate explanations\n\n## Six billion as of now\n\nThe official curl docker repository now (as of 06:43 UTC April 24, 2024)\nreports that the curl container has been pulled more than six billion times.\nCurrently, people seem to be pulling the curl image from docker.com at a rate\nof 2-3 million pulls per day (about 25 per second).\n\nIt shall be noted that a pull does not necessary imply a download. The pull is\na a check and the client may already have the latest version downloaded. It is\ntherefore not equal to six billion downloads.\n\nWe started offering docker images to the world with curl 7.65.3, July 19 2019.\nSix billion pulls in 1832 days makes an average of 38 pulls/second through all\nthis time. Less than five years.\n\nHow do I know the pull counter reached six billion? I asked their API:\n\n    \n    \n    curl https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/curlimages/ -s | jq .results[0].pull_count\n\n## Sponsored OSS\n\nWe do not pay Docker anything for this service of theirs. They also do not pay\nanything to us for our service. The Docker Sponsored OSS program lists\nconditions that might make us disqualified for being part of it, but as long\nas you don\u2019t tell them I won\u2019t. And hey, at least the first six billion pulls\nhave been served.\n\n## Other repositories\n\nYou can also opt to pull the container from other repositories like quay and\nGitHub. I have not included their pull counters in this.\n\ncURL and libcurl\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
