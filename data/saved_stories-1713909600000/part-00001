On paper, it\nwould be an affordable, high-density urbanist wonderland \u2014 but can they\nactually pull it off?\n\nIn August 2023, California Forever, a corporation founded by Jan Sramek,\nannounced plans to build a new city of up to 400,000 people in Solano County,\nforty miles northeast of San Francisco. Beginning in 2017, the company, funded\nby some of the deepest pockets in Silicon Valley, purchased 50,000 acres of\nland for an estimated $900 million. Most of the land is zoned for agricultural\nuse and is subject to slow-growth laws. A proposed ballot initiative to change\nthat will be voted on in November. If it passes, California Forever would be\nthe largest and most ambitious new development built in the state for over 50\nyears.\n\nAsterisk: I live in the Bay Area. I\u2019m thinking of buying a house in the near\nfuture, but it costs a lot of money and this really stresses me out. In other\nwords, I'm your ideal customer. So pitch me. Why do I want to live in\nCalifornia Forever?\n\nJan Sramek: You are, actually. That\u2019s great. So imagine you had a place that\nlooked like Noe Valley, or the Marina, or many of the beloved neighborhoods in\nthe Bay. Now imagine we make it better by building superblocks, for example\nlike they\u2019ve done in Barcelona, where they have internal streets where cars\ncan only go 10 miles an hour \u2014 so you can actually hang out on the streets\nwith your friends, and your kids can walk to school on a road that\u2019s safe.\n\nThen imagine that it\u2019s 25 minutes to Napa and two hours to Tahoe \u2014 much closer\nto those places than Palo Alto.\n\nAnd then imagine that you can buy \u2014 hopefully you can buy \u2014 an apartment in\nthe $400,000 range, or a nice house for $600,000. Those figures are a little\nbit up in the air, but it will definitely be more affordable. Then hopefully\nwe do a good job on schools and culture and art.\n\nAnd then imagine that because we are building lots of housing, if your friends\nwant to move into the neighborhood, there\u2019s units for them as well. You can\nactually get your friends to move into the same neighborhood, which is a real\nproblem elsewhere, because even if you get lucky and you find the one house\nthat you love somewhere in the Bay, it\u2019s difficult for your friends to move\nwithin a couple of blocks. That will be entirely possible here.\n\nA: This is going to be an expensive thing to start up. This has come up in a\nlot of discussions about this project. You\u2019re not just promising houses.\nYou\u2019re promising a lot of infrastructure, schools, transit, amenities, parks.\n\nWhat\u2019s the plan for keeping those prices affordable while supplying all of\nthose benefits?\n\nJ: One is that we paid less than you might pay otherwise for land. We have a\nbig infrastructure cost but that\u2019s not unusual for greenfield projects. In\nmost greenfield projects, you pay less for land than you would inside a city,\nthen pay infrastructure costs. And so that\u2019s similar here.\n\nThe other part of it is that there are very significant economies of scale\nwith a project like this. Yes, we do need to improve the highway and yes, we\nneed to build a big park, but those are going to be shared by thousands,\neventually tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands, of residents \u2014\nhopefully. And so you can amortize those fixed costs over a large number of\npeople.\n\nA: But isn't there a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem? To build the\ninfrastructure you need to get the residents and to get the residents you need\nto have the infrastructure to offer them.\n\nJ: There is. And that comes with having a big enough holding that you can kind\nof subsidize some of the earlier phases.\n\nThe way we think about it is: Take something like DoorDash. When they were\nstarting out, they would lose money on every order. Eventually you build a\nnetwork effect, you build scale, and it becomes cheaper. It might be that at\nthe beginning we have to subsidize the grocery store and we have to subsidize\na restaurant. But eventually you get enough people and the balance tips.\n\nA: And those subsidies would be funded by your existing backers.\n\nJ: Exactly.\n\nA: So the plan is to provide $500 million in community benefits for the town,\nwith $400 million for housing, as well as sizeable benefits \u2014 I think around\n$200 million \u2014 for downtowns in neighboring communities like Fairfield and\nVallejo. Is that all coming out of the same budget?\n\nJ: Yeah. All of that is coming from us gradually over the build-out. The\nimportant thing is that it happens proportionately as we build the community.\nAnd so we set these benefits, the $500 million in community benefits, which\nare basically grants, and then $200 million in commercial investments by us\ninto the downtowns. That happens over the build-out from 0 to 50,000\nresidents.\n\nSo by the time that we've built out 5,000 residents, it\u2019s 10% of that amount.\nIt\u2019s not all up front. It happens as we go along. Every year we\u2019ll look at how\nmany homes we\u2019ve built, and then we pay that share of it.\n\nA: Realistically, for those first 5,000 residents, what is the appeal? A\n$600,000 home in Noe Valley would be great! Anyone would go for that. But the\nfirst 5,000 residents aren\u2019t going to experience Noe Valley. Is the hope that\nthey just have to build with the expectation that it\u2019ll grow?\n\nJ: I think, on most things, it\u2019s going to be worse than Noe Valley in the\nbeginning. But it\u2019s going to be better on a couple of them.\n\nKids being able to walk to school right from the beginning is a really good\nexample. In the first phase, we can\u2019t start with 100 homes. It\u2019s just not\ngoing to work at that scale. We need the minimum critical scale. We think of\nit this way: We need one shopping street to work. So for example an Italian\nrestaurant, a Thai restaurant, an American restaurant, two coffee shops \u2014 one\npretentious and one not. And then we need a grocery store and a bar. And of\ncourse a couple of schools.\n\nFive thousand people can support that with some subsidies. That does mean that\nthe choices are limited. But there are people who really care about some of\nthose things in particular, like the fact that their kids can walk to school\nand play outside.\n\nDo I think that the early market is going to be a bunch of people in their\nearly 20s? Probably not. They would probably want more restaurants, more\npeople, and so on.\n\nBut for people having small kids, I think that might be the right trade-off,\nand they might be the right market. To some extent, they\u2019ll be taking the view\nthat they\u2019ll get in early and then the community is going to grow around them.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons why for us, the speed of the development is really\nimportant: People need to have the confidence that although there\u2019s three\nrestaurants right now, there\u2019s five more coming next year, and more the year\nafter, and so on.\n\nA: And these initial residents would probably be commuting then to the Bay or\nmaybe to Sacramento.\n\nJ: I don\u2019t know that they would. We\u2019ve had a lot of interest from employers\nsince we announced this, and we\u2019re hopeful we\u2019ll have more news to share on\nthis later in the year. We\u2019re hopeful that there might be a couple of offices\non day one, which would change the dynamic completely.\n\nAnd then, to your point of who would move there: If we get a couple of\noffices, you work for one of those companies, you can have a two-minute walk\nto the office. That\u2019s a pretty nice perk as well.\n\nAnother market, another group of people who might be early movers, are people\nwho work at Travis Air Force Base. There are 15,000 people employed there\nright now. The housing options for Travis employees are not great, and we\u2019ve\nheard from a lot of them that they would love to live there once it\u2019s going.\n\nA: You have staked the ability of this city to grow on being able to provide\njobs not just for new residents, but for existing Solano County residents. To\nback up and contextualize this for readers, most of the land you\u2019ve purchased\nis currently zoned for agriculture.The ballot initiative coming up in November\nwould change the zoning to make it urban.\n\nOne of the guarantees in this initiative is supplying 15,000 jobs in Solano\nCounty during the build-out to 50,000 residents. That is, you\u2019ve promised to\ndo this to be allowed to build there at all. This seems really steep. One\ncomparison that\u2019s come up a lot in discussions of this project is Mountain\nHouse, an unincorporated community about 30 miles away. Mountain House has a\npopulation of 30,000 and so far it\u2019s only generated about 1,500 jobs. Another\nthat comes up is Walnut Creek. These bedroom communities are often very nice\nplaces to live, but they\u2019re not employment centers.\n\nYou have a plan to do this differently. How can you attract commercial tenants\nin a way these other greenfield developments have not?\n\nJ: There\u2019s a few components to it. Scale is really important. It\u2019s really hard\nto attract an employer to Mountain House, where the full build-out is\nsomething like 50,000 residents.\n\nWe are approving up to 400,000 residents. The pitch to an employer is: If you\ntake the risk on this as a place for a new manufacturing location or a new\noffice, you won\u2019t be limited to, say, 500 employees. If this works, you can\ngrow here forever, and then your employees will be able to keep growing, and\nthere will always be enough houses for them. You solve the problem of employee\nhousing for the next 20 or 30 years. That\u2019s really attractive.\n\nThis is a challenge for many companies in the Bay Area. Their employees can\u2019t\nafford to buy a home here. They get frustrated and want to move home, back to\nIllinois or wherever it is. We can offer a place where the employees can\nbecome homeowners, they can have families, they can have a 10- or 20-minute\ncommute as the city grows. And they can buy these homes at completely\ndifferent price points than in the Bay, and still be close to headquarters.\nAnd moreover they can still get to San Francisco or Palo Alto or Menlo Park.\nThat\u2019s really powerful.\n\nI mean, Mountain House was started in 1990, right? Employers on the peninsula\nor in San Francisco didn\u2019t have a capacity issue in 1990, but they do now. And\nI think that if you look through the wave of what\u2019s happened for the last few\nyears, there was a frustration among employers in the Bay over lack of housing\ncapacity back in 2016, 2017. Then COVID happens. Everyone is going to go\nremote a year later. But actually, that doesn\u2019t work. People don\u2019t like it.\nThen everyone was going to go to Phoenix and Austin and Miami \u2014 and then a\nyear later that doesn\u2019t work. Austin is only three hours away on a plane, but\nit\u2019s not three hours away round trip. There\u2019s Uber to the airport, TSA, your\nplane is delayed, airport, and Uber to get to the office.\n\nThis is an opportunity to grow in a place where you can still get to the city\nor peninsula for a meeting in a day. It\u2019s an hour to an hour and a half, so\nyou wouldn\u2019t want to commute every day. But doing that commute once or twice a\nweek is great.\n\nA: So it\u2019s not losing option value. Like if you\u2019re a programmer in the Bay and\nyou buy a house in Solano County, you\u2019re not closing off the possibility that\nsomeday you maybe want to work at a company in San Francisco or a company in\nthe South Bay.\n\nJ: Yeah, absolutely. And many employees of Bay Area companies already live in\nSolano County. They live in Vallejo or Fairfield and they take the ferry or\nthey commute into the city. And so for some of those employers, it\u2019s a\nretention program where they don\u2019t want to lose them, and they want them to be\nmore productive by being closer.\n\nA: Why greenfield development versus working in Vallejo or Fairfield? The\nmayor of Fairfield would be really excited about having a ton of development\nin their downtown \u2014 and probably quite open to some of the really exciting\nproposals for urban development that you have. And they already have\ninfrastructure, schools, transit. Why not work in the existing towns in Solano\ncounty?\n\nJ: I became interested in solving housing problems before I started working on\nthis project. I worked on infill for a year \u2014 repurposing parking lots in\nexisting cities and so on. And the conclusion of that, at least to me, was\nthat it\u2019s not a solution. We're missing 2.5 million homes in California, while\nwe\u2019re building only 80,000 to 90,000 homes a year. That\u2019s just about enough to\nkeep the 2.5 million deficit the same given population growth and immigration.\nEven if the pace of infill increases by 50%, it will take 50 years to get back\nto where we need to be, which is too long.\n\nInfill is going to be a major part of the solution, but we need another\napproach to complement it. I didn\u2019t think that I had anything revolutionary to\nadd in the infill world. But I thought this idea was the right idea. And it\ncould be the right tool to complement infill approaches.\n\nAnd then to go back to your question about why not infill in existing towns.\nIf you talk to employers, or even large developers, about why they don\u2019t come\nto places like downtown Fairfield, you will hear that there\u2019s not enough\ncritical mass. There\u2019s not enough of a cluster there for them to make a bet on\nit. I think, ironically, the fastest way to see downtown Fairfield revitalized\nis for this project to happen and for that to bring the energy that you need\nin that area.\n\nA: And you think that it\u2019ll be easier to get critical mass for this new\ndevelopment than for existing cities in the region?\n\nJ: Yes. I think it\u2019s true that in downtown Fairfield, for example, there are a\nfew blocks that would be open for development. But that\u2019s only a few blocks \u2014\nit\u2019s not walkable \u2014 and then you\u2019ll bump up against existing neighborhoods\nthat don\u2019t want to change. And so you can\u2019t, as an employer, take a 30- or\n40-year view and say, \u201cThere\u2019s going to be enough room to grow here.\u201d It\u2019s\njust not the same.\n\nThe other part is the affordability challenge. We\u2019ve always been interested in\nmaking a dent in that. It is empirically very, very difficult to build\naffordable housing in infill locations. Every project has a huge entitlement\ncost, legal costs, the land takes forever to buy, the construction is more\nexpensive because you\u2019re operating in an existing city. If you look at where\nfirst-time homebuyers and working-class families and new immigrants are buying\nhomes in California, it\u2019s largely in exurban locations. That\u2019s where you can\nbuild affordable homes.\n\nWe\u2019re trying to find the right balance of doing that, but making it more\nwalkable and sustainable, instead of building traditional subdivisions.\n\nA: I think that your plans for the development of California Forever, the\ncity, are really smart and really well thought out. And as I\u2019ve been reading\nthem, a thought that has occurred to me is it\u2019s not just infill versus\ngreenfield. There\u2019s so much energy in California on prioritizing zoning\nreform, on policy advocacy at the city and at the state level to make the\nprocess of infill cheaper.\n\nI don\u2019t see the debate as being between, for example, doing infill, which is\nincredibly expensive, or building new cities in Solano County or other places.\nIt\u2019s, should we be figuring out how to make infill in SF, in LA, in other\nmajor cities cheaper.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not zero-sum. We can use all the units that we can get. But\nI\u2019m curious what you think of your role in this landscape. Do you think that\ngreenfield is more promising than advocacy, or do you just see it as your\ncomparative advantage?\n\nJ: I think that we\u2019ll need both. Back when I started looking at this in 2015,\nthere were a lot of really smart people working on reform at the state level\nand in the YIMBY movement. I thought that there was limited value that I had\nto add in that space. Whereas nobody was working on walkable, sustainable\ngreenfield development in the right locations. And I felt that needed to\nhappen.\n\nI think that they can be mutually reinforcing. If you look at our zoning code,\nit's basically everything that the urbanists have called for for 40 years.\n\nA: Can you expand on that?\n\nJ: It\u2019s been about simpler zoning codes that are not 2,000 pages long,\ngenuinely mixed-use development, transit and dedicated bike lanes, no parking\nminimums, very limited design standards. For example, we have a minimum\ndensity in the plan. That\u2019s completely unheard of. Nobody\u2019s ever done that.\n\nMoving an existing city into that kind of a zoning code is extremely\nchallenging. I think, in some sense, the best hope of that happening is by\nbuilding a couple of neighborhoods that people love. After that happens, it\u2019s\ngoing to be so much easier to go to existing cities and say, \u201cLook, simple\nzoning code can work and it produces cheaper homes. We should do the same\nthing.\u201d So I think that it\u2019s mutually reinforcing.\n\nAnother good example is we want better transit in the Bay Area. We need better\ntransit in the whole Northern California megaregion from San Jose all the way\nto Sacramento. One way to think about this site is that it\u2019s in the middle of\nnowhere. But if you think about that whole mega-region, it\u2019s not in the middle\nof nowhere. It\u2019s in the middle of everywhere.\n\nA: It\u2019s the same distance between SF and Solano as between Irvine and downtown\nLA.\n\nJ: Exactly. And so for many of the transportation improvements \u2014 like trains\nbetween Marin and Solano, or potentially improving the train between the\ncapital corridor from San Jose to Sacramento, for example \u2014 adding a lot of\npeople there makes the investment case better and more likely that that would\nactually get funded.\n\nA: Switching gears a little bit, I\u2019ve been listening to some of your initial\ninterviews from back in September of last year, and you talk about wanting to\ngo talk to people in Solano County and get their input. As you\u2019ve been doing\nthat over the past few months, I\u2019m curious: What are the major ways your plans\nhave changed as you\u2019ve spoken to people in Solano? What have you changed your\nmind about?\n\nJ: One is that we realized that a major concern wasn\u2019t just about protecting\nTravis, but it was actually about actively helping the base. When we started\nwe knew that we needed to make sure that we wouldn\u2019t infringe on the airspace.\nBut what we realized is that the base deals with all kinds of challenges.\n\nOne is affordability of housing for base personnel. Spousal employment is a\nhuge issue. Imagine you just got relocated from Texas, and now the closest job\ncenters are an hour and a half away.\n\nThe second is resilience and infrastructure projects. It\u2019s creating backup\nsources of power. The Department of Defense has a very aggressive renewable\nenergy mandate, which they are not meeting right now. So there was more we\ncould do for the base.\n\nWe were really pleasantly surprised by how close Rio Vista wanted to be to the\ndevelopment. We asked people, \u201cDo you want us to put new developments next to\nyou, or do you want us to put them all the way by Fairfield?\u201d And almost\nuniversally, the answer was, \u201cDon\u2019t put it immediately next to us, but we want\nit pretty close, because a lot of us moved here, and we hoped that we would\nhave more shops and a health care clinic and a couple of grocery stores, and\nthat isn\u2019t happening.\u201d\n\nAnd so we\u2019ve created this real estate parklands that we colloquially call the\nFriendship Park between the two. It\u2019s about a half a mile away from Rio Vista.\nRio Vista is an older community, partially because they have a retirement\ncommunity there and partially because a lot of the young people have left due\nto the lack of jobs. The average age is 64. There\u2019s no general practitioner\nclinic in Rio Vista. They have a van that gets there once every two weeks or\nsomething, and you get your GP visit inside a bus. I mean, it\u2019s like being in\nan emerging country.\n\nA: I\u2019m curious how you feel now about the way you initially handled the land\nbuyouts. People in Solano were confused by the initial secrecy, some are now\ninvolved in litigation, and others have lost trust in the project as a result\nof both. Are there things that you would do differently now, having seen how\nall that played out?\n\nJ: I don\u2019t think that we would have done anything differently. We knew that\nthe project would be feasible if we had the correct property. Anyone doing a\nproject like this would first buy the land and then announce the intentions \u2014\nnot the other way around.\n\nWhat\u2019s been lost in the press is that out of the 600 people from whom we\npurchased land, we have excellent relationships with 99% of them. We\u2019ve had\npeople who\u2019ve sold and used the money to buy better land if they wanted to\nkeep farming. Others sold and started businesses, they paid off debt, they\nsent kids to college or bought houses for them.\n\nIn a small number of cases, we ended up in litigation. We\u2019ve settled lawsuits\nwith three out of the four groups, and we\u2019ve been open to settling with the\nremaining one. And we\u2019ve done a lot of education with voters in the county and\nsaid, \u201cHey, this is why we got into the lawsuit. This is how we treated people\nin settlements. Here is the evidence that we have for what we allege is\nillegal activity.\u201d And most people who\u2019ve looked into it have said, \u201cWhat you\ndid was just a business decision.\u201d\n\nA: Another set of questions I have is about some of the history and the\ninspiration for these developments. You\u2019ve talked a lot in your planning\nmaterials and in interviews about how you\u2019re inspired by the British New Town\nmovement, by the Garden City movement, and especially by pre-1900 American\ncities. A common talking point you make is how all walkable cities in America\ntoday were built before 1900.\n\nBut now it\u2019s 2024. What\u2019s your plan to be the first people in 124 years to\nbuild a walkable American city? What can you actually learn from the past?\nWhat is useful today and what isn\u2019t applicable? How do you make this model\nwork in a very different society, with a very different economy, with very\ndifferent technology and very different expectations for what urban living\nlooks like?\n\nJ: I would probably divide that period into two periods.\n\nSo there was a period of a love affair with the car that lasted roughly from\nwhen the car was invented until the 1990s. It really wasn\u2019t until the 1990s\nthat people started turning around and saying, \u201cYou know, we like these\nwalkable neighborhoods and we miss them.\u201d In the previous years, nobody was\ntrying to build walkable neighborhoods because most people loved what we were\nbuilding. So that\u2019s what we built.\n\nAnd then I think in the last 30 years, so much of the story is that we've\ncreated a regulatory, zoning, home building, transportation complex \u2014 kind of\nan industrial complex, if you want \u2014 where even if you wanted to build a\nwalkable neighborhood, it was just too difficult. The transportation\ndepartment said they couldn\u2019t do it, or the fire chief said that the roads had\nto be wider. And then even if you go through many of these gates, eventually\nsomeone would say no and you couldn\u2019t get the development built.\n\nThe reason why we believe we\u2019ll be more successful than others is, I think,\nthat we care more than most people. And also that it\u2019s really hard to build\nwalkable neighborhoods at small scale. That\u2019s for two reasons. The first one\nis regulatory. If you need to change zoning, to fight against a multitude of\nagencies and stakeholders to override a process about, for example, how\nstreets are designed, and you\u2019re only building a few hundred homes, you just\nwon\u2019t have the money to do it. The economics of it doesn\u2019t add up.\n\nAnd then the second part is that walkable urbanism is really hard to build in\nsmall portions. Even if you\u2019re building 500 homes and an incredible walking\nneighborhood at the edge of an existing city, you\u2019re left with two walkable\nstreets and nowhere else to walk to. It\u2019s a problem that can only be solved at\nscale, both from a regulatory and economic perspective.\n\nA: So then we\u2019re back then to this issue of critical mass. It seems to me that\na likely outcome is you getting, say, 50,000 people, but then development\nbegins to falter. That\u2019s common for new developments like this. What do you\nsee as your biggest barriers to reaching that real critical mass that you need\nto have a truly urban development in this place?\n\nJ: The biggest challenge and the biggest opportunity is transportation because\nit\u2019s not something that we can solve by ourselves. It\u2019s a regional challenge\nfaced by everyone. The fact that we don\u2019t have a high-speed train from San\nFrancisco to Sacramento is a policy failure. We should have one. So\ntransportation is the biggest hurdle.\n\nApart from that, this is a complex coordination startup. There\u2019s a lot of\nthings that we need to do, and we need to do them right. We need to manage. We\nneed to get the community to buy in. We need to get the regulators to buy in.\nWe need to finance it correctly. We need good partnerships with employers and\nhome builders and designers.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t some kind of a breakthrough. We're not trying to invent a cure\nto some disease where we don\u2019t know a cure exists. We know we can do all of\nthose things. There\u2019s just a lot of them, and they are complex.\n\nI don\u2019t think that it\u2019s an accident that the largest successful new community\nin the country is in California, in Irvine. I think that it\u2019s a market where\nthere\u2019s such a shortage of housing that if you build something that is well\ndesigned, in a reasonable location, then you will find an audience for that\nproduct.\n\nA: But when I think about Irvine, I think about two things. One, they had a\nbig anchor tenant in the form of UC Irvine from day one. Two, Irvine was built\nin the early \u201970s during a period of increasing urbanization. People were\nmoving to California. They were moving to cities in California.\n\nAnd today \u2014 and this is a talking point you hit a lot \u2014 people are moving out\nof California, and particularly out of big California cities. Do you feel\nnervous going into this without an anchor tenant, and in a very different\nenvironment in terms of California urban population dynamics?\n\nJ: We would like this to be Irvine in that they did a few things right. They\nhad a very long time approach. They became a real steward of that property.\nThey had very high design standards for what they wanted to do.\n\nBut, I want to be clear, they wanted to build a very different kind of\nproduct. They built a first-class suburban experience. We don\u2019t want to build\nthat. I want to be very clear about that.\n\nNow, in terms of an anchor tenant, they had UC Irvine, we have UC Davis 15\nmiles north. So I think it\u2019s pretty conceivable that UC Davis residents,\nstudents, and staff will end up living in this new community.\n\nBut in addition, I\u2019m pretty confident that we\u2019ll have actual employers to\nannounce even before the election in November. We\u2019ll have anchor tenants as\nwell.\n\nAnd then on the last point, people are not leaving California because they\ndon\u2019t want to be here. People are leaving California because they can\u2019t find a\nplace where the trade-off between the cost of housing and what they get for it\nis acceptable.\n\nIf we build this, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to have a shortage of people who\nwant to live there.\n\nA: All of this presumes the ballot initiative in November goes well, that you\nget the zoning permission to build what you want to build. Do you have a\nbackup plan for if the ballot initiative fails?\n\nJ: We\u2019re pretty confident it\u2019s going to pass. Just seeing the numbers from\nlast year compared to seeing the reaction to the plan since we announced it a\nmonth ago. That really moved a lot of people out of the undecided or skeptical\nbucket.\n\nBut we do have a backup plan. We could build it more gradually. We have\nproperty inside the City of Rio Vista limits that\u2019s zoned for residential\nalready. In a recent general plan update, the city looked into annexing\nanother 1,000 acres we own and zoning it as residential.\n\nI don\u2019t think it would be the optimal outcome. It would be harder, for\nexample, to attract employers because we couldn\u2019t offer that 40-year\npredictable road map for growth. But we could absolutely build it more\nincrementally.\n\nA: I\u2019m interested when you say a lot of people changed their minds from\nundecided to positive on the plan, what have been the biggest draws for people\nin Solano?\n\nJ: I think people were pretty skeptical in the beginning when we came out. And\nthen despite their reservations, we said, hey, we\u2019ll run the most intensive\nengagement process that you\u2019ve ever seen. And I think they\u2019ve seen that that\nwas the case. We\u2019ve met with thousands of people and many interest groups. We\nlistened, we came back with new plans, and they\u2019ve seen the input they gave go\ninto those plans. People saw that we protected Travis. We created a buffer\nzone around it. They really cared about it. They didn\u2019t expect it. Many people\nhave told us, \u201cIf you are willing to put your money where your mouth is and\nactually guarantee the jobs, then I\u2019m for it. But every developer promises\njobs. Nobody ever brings them. If you guys are going to guarantee it, then\nI\u2019ll be for it.\u201d And we guaranteed it. And so that made a difference.\n\nA: What\u2019s the plan? We keep circling this question about tenants, but there is\na difference between doing your best and actually guaranteeing it. What makes\nyou confident that you\u2019ll be able to bring those jobs in?\n\nJ: The conversations that we\u2019re having with employers. We\u2019ve seen so much\ninterest since we announced the project, particularly since we shared the\nplans.\n\nWe also know that so many of their employees want to live there. It\u2019s an easy\ncase to make to say, \u201cHey, why don\u2019t you do a poll of how many residents you\nhave in Solano County? How many employees do you have in Solano County? How\nmany employees do you have who live in eastern Contra Costa County who would\nlove to work there?\u201d That helps.\n\nA: I want to talk briefly about water. This is one of the thornier planning\nchallenges that has come up in discussions of the project \u2014 there are real\nsupply issues for a community on the scale you\u2019re imagining. What\u2019s the plan\nfor that?\n\nJ: So we start by bringing the consumption down by design of reuse of\nstormwater, recharge of the aquifer, water-saving fixtures, landscaping. We\nwill have about half of the average consumption in Rio Vista. We begin by\nbringing the need down.\n\nThen we have a layered approach. The property we purchased does come with a\nsubstantial amount of groundwater and surface water rights from both the\naquifer and the river. That\u2019s likely enough for 50,000, maybe even 100,000\npeople. And then we're going to layer it by importing water from outside of\nthe county.\n\nMy favorite example is: There's an almond orchard on the north side of Travis\nthat was planted when almond prices were higher in 2016, in very marginal\ngrounds that don\u2019t produce many almonds. That orchard isn't popular for a\nvariety of reasons. Number one, it attracts birds, which create hazards for\nTravis. Number two, it was built by ripping up a big portion of the Jepson\nPrairie, which is a very unique ecosystem.\n\nPeople who care about the environment would love it turned back into pasture\nso that tiger salamanders and vernal pools can come back. Right now it uses\nabout four acre-feet of water per acre. That\u2019s about 10,000 acre-feet of water\n\u2014 the land is 2,500 acres. Our average consumption will be probably about a\nquarter of an acre per household. So it\u2019s enough water for 40,000 households\nat two and a half people per household.\n\nThat\u2019s enough water for 100,000 people just from that orchard. If we just rip\nit out and replace it with pasture, the rare species can come back. The vernal\npools can come back. Travis is better off because they don\u2019t have a hazard\nrisk from birds. And we have lots of water for lots of new residents. And so I\nthink that\u2019s a really good example of the kind of win-win-win all around that\ncan happen on that orchard.\n\nI think that the story of the project overall is like that.\n\nA: Is there anything else you really want people to understand about this\nproject and your approach that you feel is being lost in the current\nconversation?\n\nJ: I think we need to get out of this zero-sum mentality that we\u2019ve adopted,\nparticularly in the build world. It\u2019s not a zero-sum world. I think the Bay\nArea is a testament to the fact that it\u2019s not a zero-sum world, and I think\nthis project fits into that.\n\nIt\u2019s a project that can make the environment better off. It can create\neconomic opportunity for lots of people. It can help be a bridge for some of\nthe transportation solutions in the Bay. It can take some of the pressure off\nother communities. It can bring investment in existing downtowns in Solano.\nThere\u2019s a positive-sum mentality and thinking that we\u2019re trying to design into\nit through and through.\n\nJan Sramek is the founder and CEO of California Forever.\n\nPublished January 2026\n\nHave something to say?
