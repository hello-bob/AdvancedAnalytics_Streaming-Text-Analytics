You have to\nknow: What percentage of users open your app's upgrade screen? Where are the\nhurdles that prevent them from reaching a goal? How many people are using your\nnew feature?\n\nOnce you have that information, you can play around with new ways to help your\nusers reach their goals faster and more easily. You can optimize when and how\nyou ask your users to upgrade. And you can watch live as new users are pouring\ninto the screens for your cool new feature. So satisfying \ud83e\udd29\n\n  * iOS SDK\n  * Android SDK\n  * Web SDK\n\nSDKs for all major platforms and a thriving ecosystem help you get an overview\nover all your products.\n\nGet started\n\n## Better understand your customers\n\nBy default, TelemetryDeck gives you detailed information about App Version,\nDevice Type, Platform, and Distribution Mechanism. But that's just the start:\nYou decide the signal types and the metadata payload for each signal, so you\ncan include exactly the information you need to improve your app!\n\nEach time you want to send a signal to TelemetryDeck, call one (non-blocking)\nfunction: App Start. User has switched the Settings to Pizza Mode. New Data\nEntered. And so on.\n\nThat's it! Lean back and see information fill your dashboard.\n\nMore Info \u2192\n\n## Understand the data\n\nConfigure funnels and queries visually. Use our advanced query language to\ndive into your data.
