When she finally reached the tank\u2019s ground, she\nstood among the dozens of 500-tonne pillars supporting the ceiling. In the\ncavernous, shrine-like cistern, she felt humbled.\n\n\u201cYou find yourself being a tiny part of this humongous system,\u201d recalls\nTortajada, a water management expert at Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy\u2019s\nInstitute of Water Policy, in Singapore. \u201cYou realise how well prepared Tokyo\nis.\u201d\n\nIf Japan is a pilgrimage destination for disaster and risk-management experts\nlike her, this is one of its main temples. The floodwater cathedral hidden 22\nmeters underground is part of the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground\nDischarge Channel (MAOUDC), a 6.3 km long system of tunnels and towering\ncylindrical chambers that protect North Tokyo from flooding.\n\nIn the past several decades, the Japanese capital perfected the art of coping\nwith typhonic rains and moody rivers, and its intricate flood defence system\nis a global wonder. But the future seems uncertain as the climate changes and\nrain patterns shift.\n\nTokyo\u2019s battle with flooding stretches back through its history. The city sits\non a plain crossed by five rowdy river systems and dozens of individual rivers\nthat naturally swell each season. Intense urbanisation, rapid\nindustrialisation and imprudent water extraction that caused some regions to\nsink have exacerbated the city\u2019s vulnerability.\n\nInside Tokyo's floodwater cathedrals\n\nView a stunning tour of the floodwater cathedral above\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who decided to set-up Tokyo there,\u201d Tortajada, who\u2019s worked in\nwater management for over two decades, says only half-jokingly.\n\nEven if Japan has dealt with floods for centuries, Tokyo\u2019s current system\ntruly started to take shape in the post-war years. Typhoon Kathleen hit in\n1947, destroying around 31,000 homes and killing 1,100 people; one decade\nlater Typhoon Kanogawa (also known as Ida) devastated the city when around\n400mm of rain in a week. Streets, homes and businesses were inundated.\n\nAmidst the chaotic aftermath, the Japanese government stepped up its monetary\ncommitment.\n\n\u201cEven in the 1950s and 1960s, when the Japanese were recovering from the war,\nthe government was investing 6-7% of the national budget on disaster and risk\nreduction,\u201d explains Miki Inaoka, a disaster expert at the Japan International\nCooperation Agency (JICA).\n\nTokyo\u2019s planners must be wary of serveral different kind of floods. If heavy\nrain falls upstream, maybe a river breaks it banks and inundates a centric\nneighbourhood downstream. Perhaps a downpour in the city overpowers that\narea\u2019s drainage system or a high tide or tsunami could threaten the coastline.\nWhat if an earthquake destroys a dam or a levee?\n\nAfter decades of planning for these scenarios and non-stop construction, the\nJapanese capital now boasts dozens of dams, reservoirs and levees. Cut into\nthe city\u2019s ground, as you would with a birthday cake, and you will find an\nunderground maze of tunnels alongside the subway lines and gas pipelines that\ncriss-cross the city.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n  * A samurai swordsmith is making a space probe\n  * Why Japan plans to burn 'flammable ice'\n  * Ikumen: The rise of Japan's 'hot dads'\n\nThe $2 billion Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel (MAOUDC)\nand its \u2018floodwater cathedral\u2019 is one of the capital\u2019s most impressive\nengineering feats. Completed in 2006 after 13 years of works, it is the\nworld\u2019s largest diversion floodwater facility and the result of Tokyo\u2019s\ncontinuous improvement efforts.\n\nGetty Images\n\nTokyo's rivers - so beautiful for much of the year - can pose a danger in\ntimes of heavy rainfall (Credit: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cJapan is a country that believes in learning,\u201d, says Tortajada, who visited\nthe MAOUDC in 2017. \u201cThat makes it a very interesting case for study.\u201d\n\nThe Channel sucks in water from small- and mid-size rivers in Northern Tokyo\nand moves it to the bigger Edo River, which can handle the volume with more\nease.\n\nEach of these tanks is big enough to accommodate a space shuttle or the Statue\nof Liberty\n\nWhen one of these rivers overflows, the water falls to one of five enormous\n70-meter tall cylindrical tanks spread across the Channel\u2019s length. Each of\nthese tanks is big enough to accommodate a space shuttle or the Statue of\nLiberty and they are interconnected through a 6.3km long network of\nunderground tunnels. As the water approaches the Edo River, the \u2018floodwater\ncathedral\u2019 Tortajada visited reduces its flow, so the pumps can push it to the\nriver.\n\nA mental exercise can explain the potency of the Discharge Channel. Imagine a\nstandard 25m pool, filled to the brim, connected to the 13,000 horse power\npumps that release water from the Channel. If the pumps went on, if would only\ntake them two to three seconds to empty the pool, as they can push 200 tons of\nwater per second.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe pumps in the Discharge Channel could empty a 25m swimming pool in less\nthan three seconds (Credit: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a science-fiction kind of facility,\u201d says JICA\u2019s Inaoka, whose job\ninvolves collaborating with experts from developing countries to share Japan\u2019s\nexpertise.\n\nYet Inaoka also acknowledges that changing patterns in rainfall will challenge\nTokyo\u2019s infrastructure. Climate change makes it very hard to plan ahead, she\nsays.\n\nBased on historical rainfall records, the city planning authorities designed\nTokyo\u2019s defences to withstand up to 50 millimetres of rain per hour,\nparticularly in areas were people and property are concentrated. But what was\nconsidered normal fifty years ago is not anymore.\n\nAs in other parts of the world, the number of days with heavy precipitation\nhave increased in the past 30 years says the Japanese Meteorological Agency, a\nsign that patterns are changing. Some estimates suggest that over the 21st\nCentury, rainfall in Japan could increase by 10%. In the summer, that number\ncould go up to 19%.\n\nThe Tokyo Metropolitan Government Bureau of Construction claims to be aware of\nthese shifts and has raised the rainfall criteria in response. In at least\nthree areas, projects are now built to withstand between 65 and 75mm of rain\nper hour. But experts like Nobukuyi Tsuchiya, former chief civil engineer of\nTokyo\u2019s Edogawa ward, say the authorities are lingering too long on discussing\nwhat to do.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the flood control action in vision of climate change has not\nyet been established in Japan,\u201d says Tsuchiya, director of the Japan\nRiverfront Research Centre.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge and its floodwater cathedral\ncost $2 billion to build (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nIn his 2014 book \u201cShuto Suibotsu\u201d (\u2018Capital Submerged\u2019), Tsuchiya warns that\nTokyo is not prepared to deal with the downpours that could arrive with with\nglobal warming. On the low-lying areas of Tokyo, around 2.5 million people\ncould be affected by flooding in the event of record-high tides and their fate\nshould be a major planning priority, says the Japanese expert.\n\nEarlier in 2018, heavy rains in Western Japan killed hundreds of people and\ncaused millions in economic damages as rivers burst their banks and\noverflowed. Were that to happen in Tokyo, Tsuchiya says, the city would be\ndevastated.\n\nThat risk is not unique to Tokyo. Major cities like New York, Shanghai and\nBangkok will become increasingly vulnerable to floods and storms as a result\nof climate change and, like Japan\u2019s capital, most showcase a mix of assessing\noptions and slowly working to set up new defences.\n\nLondon\u2019s climate change adaptation plan, for instance puts flooding as its\nnumber one threat, as one fifth of the city lies on the Thames river\nfloodplain. The area is well-defended by embankments and the robust Thames\nBarrier east of the city, but planners believe there may come a time when\nthose safeguards fail. Across the Atlantic, Miami is already battling rising\nsea level rise one street at a time.\n\nIn Singapore, Cecilia Tortajada and other experts are working on how to\nprotect the city-state from rising waters in the years to come. The local\nBuilding and Construction Authority (BCA) recently commissioned a study to\ninform the national framework for coastal protection and new measures are\nintroduced yearly.\n\nBut everyone is keeping an eye on Tokyo, trying to gauge how well it weathers\nthe typhoons and summer downpours testing its shields.\n\n\u201cIf a country as prepared as Japan is suffering, and a city like Tokyo\nsuffers, we should all be paying attention,\u201d sighs Tortajada.\n\n\\--\n\nDiego Arguedas Ortiz is a science and climate change reporter for BBC Future.\nHe is @arguedasortiz on Twitter.\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or\nInstagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter,\ncalled \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.
