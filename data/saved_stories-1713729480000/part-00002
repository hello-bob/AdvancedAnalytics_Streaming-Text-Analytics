Someone posts a comment.\n\nYour comment form points to welcomments.io/api/comments.\n\nYour visitor writes their love letter and presses \"send\". We receive the\ncomment and handle all of the validation, spam checking, sanitization, and\nother behind-the-scenes ceremony.\n\n## 2\\. We commit it.\n\nAfter processing the comment, we turn it into a JSON file.\n\nThen we commit the file to the data directory of your static site generator,\non the main branch of your GitHub repository.\n\nWe also handle retrying and temporarily storing the comment for you if GitHub\nis being sassy.\n\n## 3\\. Such HTML. Much static. Wow.\n\nNetlify (or equivalent) rebuilds your site.\n\nYour static site generator renders the comment as fully static HTML at the\nbottom of your article. Netlify deploys your site to their CDN as pre-rendered\nstatic HTML files that load fast, are SEO-friendly, and cheap to host.\n\nWe get our hands off and the comment file is fully yours.\n\n## Easy installation\n\nSet it up in minutes, not hours\n\nClick some buttons and you're done. We'll make a pull request that has\neverything you need.\n\n> \u201cWelcomments is exactly the comment system I was looking for: lightweight,\n> secure, and easy to use.

Only if you want to, that is.\n\nSEO-friendly\n\n    \n\nBecause the comments are rendered as static HTML, search engines have no\nproblem indexing their content.\n\nModest Javascript\n\n    \n\nOur optional JS snippet is only 2.1 kB, making it the tiniest Javascript\nsnippet on the comment system market.\n\nCourier, not a deposit box\n\n    \n\nWe deliver the comments safely to your GitHub repository, but after that, you\ndon\u2019t need to phone our servers to display them on your site.\n\nNo Disqus-ting stuff\n\n    \n\nWe\u2019re a comment system, not an ad network or data miner. We hate ads and\nwouldn\u2019t know how to mine data even if someone threatened to tickle our feet,\nso you\u2019re safe with us.\n\n## Ready to dive in?
