Civil Rights Law\n\nThe Origins Of Woke, by Richard Hanania, has an ambitious thesis. And it\nargues for an ambitious thesis. But the thesis it has isn\u2019t the one it argues\nfor.\n\nThe claimed thesis is \u201cthe cultural package of wokeness is downstream of civil\nrights law\u201d. It goes pretty hard on this. For example, there\u2019s the title, The\nOrigins Of Woke. Or the Amazon blurb: \u201cThe roots of the culture lie not in the\nculture itself, but laws and regulations enacted decades ago\u201d. Or the banner\nad:\n\nThe other thesis, the one it actually argues for, is \u201cUS civil rights law is\nbad\u201d. On its own, this is a fine thesis. A book called Civil Rights Law Is Bad\nwould - okay, I admit that despite being a professional Internet writer I have\nno idea how the culture works anymore, or whether being outrageous is good or\nbad for sales these days. We\u2019ll never know, because Richard chose to wrap his\nargument in a few pages on how maybe this is the origin of woke or something.\nStill, the book is on why civil rights law is bad.\n\nModern civil rights law is bad (he begins) for reasons baked into its history.\nThe original Civil Rights Act of 1964 was supposed to be an ad hoc response to\nthe outrageous level of anti-black racism going on in the South, which\nprotests and TV news had finally brought to the attention of the white\nmajority. There was broad support for a bill which was basically \u201cdon\u2019t be the\nKKK\u201d.\n\nSex discrimination got tacked on half as a joke, half as a poison pill by its\nenemies to make the bill unpalatable (fact check: true - but there\u2019s a deeper\nstory, see this Slate article for more details). Ideas about \u201caffirmative\naction\u201d and \u201cdisparate impact\u201d weren\u2019t tacked on at all; the bill\u2019s proponents\ndenied that it could be used to justify anything of the sort, and even agreed\nto include language in the bill saying it was against that. Still, after the\nbill was passed, a series of executive orders, judicial decisions, and\nbureaucratic power grabs put all those things in place.\n\nThe key point here is that \u201cquotas\u201d, or any kind of \u201cpositive discrimination\u201d\nwhere minorities got favored over more-qualified whites, were anathema to\nlawmakers and the American people. But civil rights activists, the courts, and\nthe bureaucracy really wanted those things. So civil rights law became a giant\nkludge that effectively created quotas and positive discrimination while\nmaintaining plausible deniability. This ended up as the worst of both worlds.\nHanania specifically complains about1:\n\nAffirmative Action\n\nHanania\u2019s take on affirmative action involves the government sending companies\na message like this:\n\n  1. We notice your workforce has fewer minorities than the applicant pool.\n\n  2. If this remains true, we\u2019ll sue you for millions of dollars and destroy your company. So by the next time we check, your workforce had better have exactly many minorities as the applicant pool.\n\n  3. But you\u2019re not allowed to explicitly favor minority applicants over whites. You certainly can\u2019t do anything flagrant, like set a quota of minority employees equal to their level in the applicant pool.\n\n  4. Have fun!\n\n(here \u201cthe applicant pool\u201d is an abstraction, often but not always the same as\nthe general population, which is poorly defined and which bureaucracies can\ninterpret however they want. It\u2019s definitely not the same thing as the actual\nset of qualified applicants to the business!)\n\nThis satisfied the not-really-paying attention white electorate, because\npoliticians could tell them that \u201cquotas are illegal, we\u2019re sure not doing\nanything like that\u201d. And it satisfied civil rights activists, because\ninevitably businesses/departments came up with secret ways to favor minorities\nuntil representation reached the level where they wouldn\u2019t get sued.\n\nA recent case illustrates the results of this double-bind. The FAA hires air\ntraffic controllers. They used to judge applicants based on a test which\nmeasured their skills at air traffic control. This resulted in comparatively\nfew black air traffic controllers. Various civil rights groups put pressure on\nthem, and they replaced the test with a \u201cbiographical questionnaire\u201d. The\nquestionnaire asked weird unrelated questions about your life, and you got\npoints if you gave the answer that the FAA thought black people might give\n(for example, if you said your worst subject was science). This still didn\u2019t\nget them enough black employees, so they secretly told black communities\nexactly what answers to put on the questionnaire to go through.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to blame the FAA here, but (Hanania says) civil rights law almost\nforces you to do something like this. People tried simpler things, like\nkeeping a test but giving minority applicants extra points. The courts and\ncivil rights bureaucracy struck these down as illegal. The almost-explicit\npolicy was that you had to get more minority employees, but you had to hide it\ncarefully enough that the American people (who were still against racial\npreferences) wouldn\u2019t catch on.\n\nDisparate Impact\n\nNot only can you not explicitly discriminate, you can\u2019t use hiring criteria\nthat \u201caccidentally\u201d discriminate by favoring one race over another. To give a\nstupid example, if someone refused to hire anyone from Detroit, this would\nhave \u201cdisparate impact\u201d since Detroit is a majority black city. If you allowed\nstuff like this, racists could covertly discriminate by using these sorts of\nrules.\n\nBut Hanania challenges us to think of any criterion that isn\u2019t potentially\nracially biased. For example, we know universities discriminate against\nAsians, so only hiring people with college degrees is a \u201cdisparate impact\u201d. We\nknow that more men than women have experience as miners, so a mining company\nonly hiring employees with experience is a \u201cdisparate impact\u201d. Since whites\ntypically do better on IQ tests than blacks, and all cognitive skills are\ncorrelated with IQ, the Supreme Court decided in Duke vs. Griggs that all\ntests of any ability were potentially disparate impact, and you opened\nyourself to lawsuits if you used any of them.\n\n(in theory, companies are allowed to use tests and similar criteria if they\nprove them nondiscriminatory. But the standards for this - they have to prove\nit for each race and each job site individually - are so high that, in\npractice, few companies take this route.)\n\nSince this technically banned all possible criteria, companies couldn\u2019t follow\nthe letter of the law. Instead they hired fancy lawyers to tell them which way\nthe winds were blowing. The lawyers told them that college degrees were okay,\nresumes with biographies and experience were maybe okay, and interviews were\nokay. Tests were out. Anything more creative was out.\n\nA disparate impact case made the news recently. The Biden EEOC sued\nconvenience store chain Sheetz for running criminal background checks on their\nemployees. They didn\u2019t allege any intentional discrimination. They just said\nthat more minorities fail criminal background checks than whites, therefore\nit\u2019s disparate impact, therefore Sheetz has to drop the criminal background\ncheck.\n\n(the article links to another case where the Obama EEOC sued a corporate\nevents planner, demanding they give monetary compensation to an employee who\nthey had refused to hire simply because he had committed attempted murder and\nlied about it on their job application)\n\nIs Sheetz the only company that does criminal background checks on its\nemployees? Do they do the background checks differently than any other\ncompany? My understanding is that the technical answer is that to do\nbackground checks without being sued, you have to prove in some very formal\nway that the specific crimes you\u2019re looking for would be bad for your specific\nindustry, and maybe Sheetz didn\u2019t prove that a general history of violence was\nbad for convenience stores. But if this sounds kind of fake to you, and you\u2019re\nwondering whether the real rule is \u201cthe government has wide discretion to\nprosecute whoever it feels like\u201d, Hanania\u2019s answer is \u201cdefinitely yes\u201d.\n\nHis position is that all of these rules are so broad that every company is\nalways violating them in some sense. No company has exactly the same\ndistribution of minorities as \u201cthe applicant pool\u201d, whatever that is. No\ncompany has some magical hiring rule that has literally zero correlation with\nrace, especially since black people are on average poorer, less educated, and\nless likely to have any given achievement (so any attempt to choose better\nemployees over worse will necessarily disadvantage them). In real life, the\nbureaucracy\u2019s rules are something like \u201cdon\u2019t do anything different from other\ncompanies in your industry, and especially don\u2019t be caught seeming less woke\u201d.\nHanania argues this creates an arms race / ratchet. Every company wants to be\nat least 50th percentile wokeness or above. But not every company can be above\naverage. So everybody gets more and more woke, with no end in sight.\n\nContinuing with Sheetz: according to the article on the lawsuit, in 2020 they\n\u201cintroduced the IDEA initiative\u201d, ie Inclusion Diversity Equality &\nAccessibility. Their website has a big picture of a black woman saying \u201cWe\u2019re\nBuilding A Great Place To Work For All\u201d, and boasts that they\u2019ve created a\nspecial forum for black employees. They\u2019ve made 60% of managers women, started\na Woman\u2019s Leadership Program, offered generous maternity leave, and written\nletters to the Chamber of Commerce on how the George Floyd murder made them\nrealize \u201cwe quickly needed to learn, listen, be vulnerable and humbly approach\n. . . culture-shifting work\u201d. Companies hope that if they do enough of this\nstuff, the EEOC will agree they\u2019re an ally in the civil rights project and not\nsue them under their wide discretion to sue basically anyone. Too bad they\u2019re\ngetting sued anyway; some other convenience store must have done more of this\nstuff. Surely some executive is wishing they had just tried having one more\nmandatory diversity training...\n\nHarassment Law\n\nHarassment law might win the award for most complicated chain of reasoning\nfrom real legislation to enforcement:\n\n  * Legislation says you can\u2019t discriminate against minorities\n\n  * If you bully minorities out of your company, that would be a way to discriminate against them.\n\n  * So you can\u2019t have an environment that\u2019s so hostile to minorities that they inevitably leave.\n\n  * In some sense, anything that offends a minority is part of this environment.\n\n  * Any joke, political comment, flirtation, etc, could potentially offend a minority.\n\n  * Therefore, every business owner needs to monitor their employees for jokes, political comments, flirtatiousness, and take action against any offenses.\n\nHanania has several complaints here. First and most legibly, it (say it with\nme) gets taken too far.\n\n> Volokh lists a large number of [examples of things that have been found to\n> be] evidence of a hostile work environment: signs with the phrase \u201cmen\n> working\u201d; \u201cdraftsman\u201d and \u201cforeman\u201d as job titles, pictures of Ayatollah\n> Khomeini and a burning American flag in a cubicle; an ad campaign using\n> samurai, kabuki, and sumo wrestling to refer to Japanese competition; jokes\n> of a sexual nature not targeted at any particular person; misogynistic rap\n> music [...] even terms like \u201cgreat view\u201d and \u201cwalk-up\u201d have been cited as\n> potentially trying to exclude blind people and those in wheelchairs.\n\nAnd\n\n> In a 2015 and 2016, a black father and son named Owen Diaz and Demetric Di-\n> az2 [sic] worked at a Tesla plant. They sued the company for racial\n> discrimination, with the father\u2019s claims alone making it to trial....racial\n> slurs were used in the presence of Diaz, and he saw racist graffiti on a\n> bathroom wall. It appears that the workers allegedly responsible were mostly\n> or all minorities themselves, and each time an allegation could be verified,\n> the employee was punished. Tesla claimed that they had taken enough steps to\n> address the concerns of Diaz [...] a jury disagreed, and awarded the\n> plaintiff $137 million, an amount that the judge reduced to $15 million. In\n> response to the verdict, Tesla released a statement pointing out that\n> witnesses confirmed that the slurs were used in a friendly manner, usually\n> by African-American employees, and without hostile intent.\n\n(fact check: this article says the racism also included demands to \u201cgo back to\nAfrica\u201d people leaving drawings of caricatured black cavemen at the employee\u2019s\ndesk, threats, and claims that black employees were \"given the most menial and\nphysically demanding work\" - and that these claims were backed up by testimony\nfrom two dozen former workers and a cellphone video showing people telling a\nblack employee that they are going to \u201ccut you up, n\u2014-r\u201d. This seems like a\nsufficiently different story that I\u2019d like to know whether Hanania still\nstands by his version)\n\nOther parts of harassment law lead to more unfair double-binds. For example,\nyou can\u2019t be seen to \u201cretaliate\u201d against someone who accuses another worker of\nharassment. So suppose that a minority employee is bullying a white employee,\nthe white employee resists, and the minority accuses them as \u201charassment\u201d.\nMaybe there\u2019s even a full trial, everyone agrees this is what happened, and\nthe white employee is found totally innocent. Still, you can\u2019t fire the bully,\nbecause that would be retaliation for a harassment complaint. And since you\nprobably don\u2019t want the bully and their victim in the same department, you\nneed to move one of them. And you can\u2019t move the bully, because that would be\nviewed as \u201cretaliation\u201d for the harassment complaint and they could sue you\nfor millions of dollars. So you have to punish the victim.\n\nBut Hanania doesn\u2019t just say this kind of thing goes too far. He has some\nbroader point that I have trouble interpreting - basically that corporations\nused to be cozy, chummy places full of banter and flirtation that everyone\nenjoyed, and now this has been universally replaced with the bland soul-\ndraining bureaucratic corporate aesthetic satirized in works like Office\nSpace.\n\nIs this true? People talk about Mad Men (I\u2019ve never seen it) as reflecting\nsome kind of corporate golden age where at least high-ranking men enjoyed\ntheir jobs. If so, did it change because of harassment law? Or because\nneoliberalism replaced the work-for-thirty-years-and-get-a-golden-watch\ncorporation with the work-for-three-years-and-then-seek-a-better-job-elsewhere\ncorporation?\n\nStill, Hanania really hammers in this point that we should apparently all be\nangry about the loss of corporate flirtation - he calls the current regime, \u201ca\nsexless, androgynous, and sanitized workplace\u201d which is \u201ccontrary to human\nnature [and] miserable\u201d. Without civil rights law, we could have\n\u201corganizations that combined the aspects of a church, a social club, a\nmatchmaking service, and a traditional business.\u201d\n\nIn such a world:\n\n> Some corporations start encouraging dating and forming close personal bonds\n> among their employees. This can take many forms, from Christian matchmaking\n> to promoting a party-like atmosphere. These pro-relationship corporations\n> will come in conservative or liberal forms. Other firms explicitly market\n> themselves as providing a more \u201cprofessional\u201d or \u201cclassic\u201d work experience .\n> . . we will see a period of wild experimentation, with some forms of\n> corporate organization drawing a great deal of media coverage. People will\n> criticize many of these experiments, and they will become the subject of\n> public outrage. After civil rights law has been defanged, however,\n> government no longer has the ability to easily shut such efforts down.\n> Eventually, public anger subsides, and the idea of the media attacking a\n> firm because it dislikes its internal culture will seem as intolerant as\n> attacking a religious community for its doctrines, or homosexuals for what\n> they do together as consenting adults.\n\nI appreciate my anti-civil-rights books doubling as interesting settings for\npornographic stories, but I\u2019m otherwise unable to fathom the level of\nHanania\u2019s enthusiasm here.\n\n...And More\n\nRichard Hanania hates all this stuff.\n\nPartly he hates it because he thinks it\u2019s unfair and anti-business and anti-\nmerit. But also, Vaclav Havel talks about the indignity of life under\ncommunism. You weren\u2019t allowed to just do your job and pay your taxes and\nfollow the laws of the communist state. You had to be actively complicit. You\nhad to act enthusiastic about the communism, force it upon others, inform on\nyour colleagues and punish deviation - at least if anybody was going to check\nlater. This kind of communism didn\u2019t just hurt your pocketbook. It damaged\nyour soul. It molded you into a worse and uglier type of person who would\neventually abandon their better impulses in order to justify their actions to\nthemselves.\n\nThis is how Hanania thinks of civil rights law. Business owners can\u2019t just\ngive blacks ten extra points on the screening test and call it a day. They\nhave to favor blacks while insisting to everyone that they don\u2019t do this and\nit\u2019s perfectly fair and they love civil rights law. They have to twist their\nemployment criteria into some kind of illegible monstrosity so nobody can\nnotice all the favoritism they\u2019re doing, then tell everybody that they believe\nthe monstrosity is \u201cfairer\u201d. They have to hire a bunch of diversity\ncoordinators - not because they\u2019re required to hire diversity coordinators,\nit\u2019s not a requirement - but because they love equality so so much (and if\nthey don\u2019t do this, they\u2019ll get sued for seemingly unrelated reasons).\nEveryone faces a constant threat of lawsuits which can only be warded against\nby seeming maximally woke and maximally enthusiastic and maximally happy about\nall the idiotic fake laws you are being forced to comply with.\n\nLike in communism, you have to become your own mini-police state. You have to\nmake employees snitch on each other if they tell the wrong joke. You have to\nturn your company into a tyranny of HR ladies. If you do any of this even a\nlittle less than other companies, you\u2019ll get sued for seemingly unrelated\nreasons, with penalties running potentially into the hundreds of millions of\ndollars.\n\nBecause there\u2019s no legible law except \u201cbe the same as everyone else so you\ndon\u2019t stand out as sue-able\u201d, every corporation homogenizes into the same\nbland HR-ocracy. Everyone agrees on the same hiring process, which is to\nprioritize college degree, resume, and interview, and definitely not any test\nor measure of ability. This leads inevitably to our current society, where\neveryone has to waste their childhood doing meaningless extracurriculars so\nthey can get into the best college so they can take the best internships so\nthey get the best jobs.\n\n(unless they do something stupid like let themselves get the dreaded \u201cresume\ngap\u201d).\n\nBut also:\n\nDuring the early 1800s, government positions were given out by the \u201cspoils\nsystem\u201d, basically \u201cdoes the party in power like you personally?\u201d In the\n1880s, after President Garfield was assassinated by a guy who didn\u2019t get a\ngood enough position, they switched to a formal civil service, based on test\nperformance and merit. The US civil service became the envy of the world,\nattracted some of the smartest people in the country, and obviously worked\nbetter than the old system wherever it was possible to compare. Still, this\ngradually (and somewhat deniably) ended in the 1970s, because the merit-based\nhiring system seemed like disparate impact. Hanania calls the current era \u201cthe\nracial spoils system\u201d, where positions in the bureaucracy are based on the\nsame kind of illegible morass as everything else (eg the FAA\u2019s \u201cbiographical\nquestionnaire\u201d). He says every branch of government has become less effective\nas a result.\n\nHanania doesn\u2019t mention this, but I\u2019ve heard an additional argument elsewhere.\nIt\u2019s legally dangerous for companies to hire based on anything like merit.\nStill, if you have great lawyers and are willing to pay a lot to settle\nlawsuits, you can get away with legally dangerous things. This is only worth\nit if you really really want high-merit employees, ie if the best employee is\nmuch more financially valuable to you than the second-best. This is mostly\ntrue in Wall Street (where you want your trader to outsmart the other guy\u2019s\ntrader by half a millisecond or whatever) and Silicon Valley (where ten\nemployees can write a program used by millions of people). So the government,\nthe civil service, the schools, etc, all abandoned merit-based hiring, while\nWall Street and Silicon Valley lawyered up. But that means that if you\u2019re a\nsmart non-minority college graduate, you know that joining the civil service\nwill be a mess - you\u2019ll have a tough time even getting in, and you\u2019ll always\nbe passed over for promotions for less-qualified minorities. Meantime, Wall\nStreet and Silicon Valley would love to have you. So all the smart people got\nconcentrated in a few industries that might not have been their most\neconomically productive use, and the old American tradition where elite\nfamilies would send some of their kids into public service died out.\n\nWhat To Do?\n\nHanania stresses that most Americans hate affirmative action (and probably by\nextension most other civil rights law, though they\u2019ve probably never heard of\ndisparate impact). Affirmative action has been on the ballot nine times, and\nfailed eight of those. Most recently, it failed in California, a deep-blue,\n66% minority state where the pro-AA side outspent opponents 17-to-1.\n\nAlso, Republicans have controlled all the branches of government many times in\nthe past fifty years, and now they control the Supreme Court. Most civil\nrights law is based on executive orders and judicial decisions, so you\nwouldn\u2019t even need a Congressional vote to overturn it. Just an executive\norder, from any president who felt like it. Reagan could have overturned half\nof this with the stroke of a pen, if he\u2019d wanted. So how has it survived this\nlong?\n\nHis answer: because until about 2010, Republicans were too scared of getting\ncalled racist. Reagan wanted to overturn affirmative action, but other\nRepublicans (like Bob Dole) begged him not to, because racism, and eventually\nhe caved. But since 2010, everyone has already been calling Republicans racist\nall the time, to the point where probably this threat has lost its power. And\nthe sort of moderate Republicans who reined in Reagan are gone. So why haven\u2019t\nRepublicans (eg Trump) acted? Hanania thinks everyone is so obsessed with\n\u201cwoke\u201d culture war stuff that the low-hanging fruit of actual woke laws that\npresidents can change has slipped under the radar.\n\nAnd so, this book. I would have summarized the case as \u201cHey, Republicans! Do\nyou hate wokeness? Well, too bad, it\u2019s a vast cultural movement with bastions\nin a bunch of places where we have no power. But some of this civil rights law\nstuff seems pretty related to wokeness, and we do potentially have power\nthere. So instead of fighting the unwinnable cultural battle, how about we\nfight the very winnable policy one?\u201d\n\nBut maybe this didn\u2019t seem optimistic enough for Hanania, so he framed it as\n\u201cthe legal wokeness is the source of the cultural wokeness\u201d instead. More on\nthis later.\n\n##\n\nThe Origins Of . . . Inequality\n\nA progressive, reading this book, might counter: \u201cSure, civil rights law -\nlike all law - is poorly written and kludgy in parts. Like all law, it\nsometimes gets abused or taken too far. Those are the costs. But the benefits\nare that it fights discrimination and inequality. That\u2019s very important! Don\u2019t\nyou think those benefits are worth the cost?\u201d\n\nUnless I missed it, Hanania doesn\u2019t touch this obvious counterargument. He\nbriefly says that in a free market, companies couldn\u2019t consistently maintain\ndiscrimination, because that would be leaving money on the ground.\n\n\u201cCool theoretical result,\u201d objects the hypothetical opponent. \u201cBut white\nhouseholds earn an average of $80K and black households an average of $50K,\nand so on with other minority groups. So it sure seems like something\ninequality-related is going on.\u201d\n\nMy tongue-in-cheek reframing of Hanania\u2019s summary of civil rights law went:\n\n>   1. We notice your workforce is less black than the applicant pool.\n>\n>   2. If this remains true, we\u2019ll sue you for millions of dollars and destroy\n> your company. So by the next time we check, your workforce had better be\n> exactly as black as the general population.\n>\n>   3. But you\u2019re not allowed to explicitly favor black applicants over\n> whites. You certainly can\u2019t do anything flagrant, like set a quota of black\n> employees equal to their level in the applicant pool.\n>\n>   4. Have fun!\n>\n>\n\nOur hypothetical opponent could argue there\u2019s nothing necessarily\ncontradictory or Orwellian about this. If your company is whiter than its\napplicant pool (eg the general population3), then you must be discriminating.\nIf you stop discriminating, you can get racial balance without any of that\nnasty quota stuff. So what\u2019s the problem?\n\nEveryone is so circumspect when talking about race that I can never figure out\nwhat anyone actually knows or believes. Still, I think most people would at\nleast be aware of the following counterargument: suppose you\u2019re the math\ndepartment at a college. You might like to have the same percent black as the\ngeneral population (13%). But far fewer than 13% (let\u2019s say 2%) of good math\nPhDs are black. So it\u2019s impossible for every math department to hire 13% black\nmath professors unless they lower their standards or take some other drastic\nmeasure.\n\nOkay, says our hypothetical opponent. Then that means math grad programs are\ndiscriminating against blacks. Fine, they\u2019re the ones we should be\ninvestigating for civil rights violations.\n\nNo, say the math grad programs, fewer than 13% of our applicants are black\ntoo.\n\nFine, then the undergrad programs are the racists. Or if they can prove\nthey\u2019re not, then the high schools are racist and we should do busing. The\npoint is, somebody somewhere along the line has to be racist, right?\n\nI know of four common, non-exclusive answers to this question.\n\n  1. Yes, the high schools (or whatever) are racist. And if you can present a study proving that high schools aren\u2019t racist, then it\u2019s the elementary schools. And if you have a study there too, it\u2019s the obstetricians, giving black mothers worse pregnancy care. If you have a study disproving that too, why are you collecting all these studies? Hey, maybe you\u2019re the racist!\n\n  2. Maybe institutions aren\u2019t too racist today, but there\u2019s a lot of legacy of past racism, and that means black people are poor. And poor people have fewer opportunities and do worse in school. If you have a study showing that black people do worse even when controlled for income, then maybe it\u2019s some other kind of capital, like educational capital or social capital. If you have studies about those too, see above.\n\n  3. Black people have a bad culture. Something something shoes and rap music, trying hard at school gets condemned as \u201cacting white\u201d. They should hold out for a better culture. I hear nobody\u2019s using ancient Sumerian culture these days, maybe they can use that one.\n\n  4. White people have average IQ 100, black people have average IQ 85, this IQ difference accurately predicts the different proportions of whites and blacks in most areas, most IQ differences within race are genetic, maybe across-race ones are genetic too. I love Hitler and want to marry him.\n\nNone of these are great options, and I think most people work off some vague\ncloud of all of these and squirm if you try to make them get too specific. I\ndon\u2019t exactly blame Hanania for not taking a strong stand here. It\u2019s just\nstrange to assume civil rights law is bad and unnecessary without having any\nopinion on whether any of this is true, whether civil rights law is supposed\nto counterbalance it, and whether it counterbalances it a fair amount.\n\nA cynic might notice that in February of this year, Hanania wrote Shut Up\nAbout Race And IQ. He says that the people who talk about option 4 are \u201cwrong\nabout fundamental questions regarding things like how people form their\npolitical opinions, what makes for successful movements, and even their own\nmotivations.\u201d A careful reader might notice what he doesn\u2019t describe them as\nbeing wrong about. The rest of the piece almost-but-not-quite-explicitly\nclarifies his position: I read him as saying that race realism is most likely\ntrue, but you shouldn\u2019t talk about it, because it scares people.\n\n(I\u2019m generally against \u201ccalling people out\u201d for believing in race realism. I\nthink people should be allowed to hide beliefs that they\u2019d get punished for\nnot hiding. I sympathize with some of these positions and place medium\nprobability on some weak forms of them. I think Hanania is open enough about\nwhere he\u2019s coming from that this review doesn\u2019t count as a callout.)\n\nHis foil here is race realist Nathan Cofnas, who says you have to discuss\nthese things. Otherwise progressives can win every argument by using the line\nof reasoning above - \u201cJust look how much inequality there still is, this shows\nthere\u2019s still lots of racism or at least the lingering effects of past racism,\nobviously our job isn\u2019t done yet and we need lots more civil rights law to\ncombat it.\u201d\n\nHanania\u2019s answer to Cofnas is that this isn\u2019t a debate club. \u201cAh, but Glaucon,\nyour claim that affirmative action is unnecessary must imply the corollary\nthat there must be no inequality, thus proving a contradiction.\u201d LOL no.\nRealistically this will get fought on the level of \u201cYou oppose affirmative\naction, which makes you a gross Nazi\u201d vs. \u201cYou support affirmative action,\nwhich makes you an annoying wokescold.\u201d Just say the wokescold thing louder\nthan your enemies say the Nazi thing, and you win. Talking about racial\ndifferences scares people off and doesn\u2019t help.\n\nI find it hard not to feel contempt for this level of contempt for reason, but\nHanania is no doubt right about the strategic considerations. And in his book,\nhe follows his own principle. There\u2019s no discussion of why civil rights law\nmight be necessary, or why it might be impossible for companies to hire enough\nminorities without reverse discrimination. As he predicts on his blog, it\u2019s\nnot fatal. You wouldn\u2019t notice unless you were looking for it.\n\nI\u2019m not really sure what to do here. How do you review a book that has a\nglaring omission, but also its author has written an essay called Here\u2019s Why I\nLike Glaring Omissions And Think Everyone Should Have Them? Is it dishonest?\nSome sort of special super-meta-honesty? How many stars do you take off?\nNothing in my previous history of book-reviewing has prepared me for this\nquestion.\n\n##\n\nThe Origins Of . . . Racial Categories\n\nHanania presents a few scattered arguments that civil rights law is the origin\nof woke, of which the section on racial categories was most interesting.\n\nHaving instituted affirmative action, the government had to decide what\ncategories it was going to inspect businesses for. Like the rest of civil\nrights law, the resulting system was a bunch of political kludges. There is no\n\u201ctrue\u201d set of races that \u201cfalls out naturally\u201d from genetic or cultural data,\nbut the US government\u2019s system was especially fake and embarrassing.\n\n  * They created the concept of \u201cAsian-American\u201d by combining the old category \u201cOriental\u201d together with Indians, Pakistanis, Thais, etc. Then, under pressure from the Hawaiian delegation, they added Pacific Islanders to create a even more heterogenous and meaningless category of \u201cAAPI\u201d (Asian American or Pacific Islander). Then, under more pressure from Hawaii later, they separated out \u201cNative Hawaiian\u201d again. The result is that Pakistanis, Koreans, and Tongans are the \u201csame race\u201d, but Hawaiians and Samoans are \u201cdifferent races\u201d.\n\n  * They combined Mexican-Americans, Cuban-Americans, and Puerto Ricans - previously three different groups that had been viewed as \u201cwhite lite\u201d along the same lines as Italians - into the new race \u201cHispanic\u201d, adding in all of South and Central America for good measure. Then, under pressure from black activists who were worried that some blacks would reclassify as Hispanics and they\u2019d lose constituents, they declared Hispanics to be an \u201cethnicity\u201d that you could have along with a different race. So a white Spaniard from Spain and a white Spaniard from Mexico got treated as different ethnicities, but a white Spaniard from Mexico and a Mayan from Mexico got the same ethnicity.\n\n  * Even though Arabs and Muslims are one of the most discriminated-against groups in the country, especially after 9-11, they didn\u2019t have good lobbyists, so they got classified as white. According to Hanania, the government\u2019s dividing line for white vs. PoC is at the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, and nobody knows what to do about eg Uzbeks. Hanania himself is Palestinian-American and seems salty about this.\n\nAll of this means that (for example) a company that had 10 Pakistanis and 10\nAfghans might get classified as \u201ctoo white\u201d and get sued for failing to hire\nenough Asian-Americans. But a company that had 20 Pakistanis, or 10 Pakistanis\n+ 10 Koreans, would be fine.\n\nHanania argues that this has gone beyond corporations and seeped into the\nculture, helping create modern wokeness. For example, after some Chinese\npeople got beaten up a few years ago, there was a campaign to #StopAAPIHate,\nas if AAPI were a natural category, or there were some racists targeting AAPIs\nin particular. Does this mean government-mandated racial categories are\ninvading our deepest thoughts?\n\nThat one campaign was kind of silly. But aside from that example, I don\u2019t\nusually hear people talk about AAPIs outside a purely legal context. All my\nAsian (eg Chinese, Japanese, etc) friends self-identify as Asian. When\nEverything Everywhere All At Once came out, people said it was a movie about\nthe \u201cAsian\u201d experience. The top Ivy League colleges have an Asian Student\nAssociation (Harvard), an Asian American Students Alliance (Yale), or an Asian\nAmerican Students Association (Princeton), with Pacific Islanders nowhere to\nbe seen. With all due respect, Hanania really doesn\u2019t have much here beyond\nthe #StopAAPIHate thing - which seemed like a weird astroturf campaign in\nother ways and probably shouldn\u2019t be taken as actual grassroots racial\ncategorization.\n\nThe point about \u201cHispanics\u201d is better taken, and you can read more about the\ncase here. But since 1964, when Mexican-Americans, Cuban-Americans, and Puerto\nRicans were the three equally-sized and equally-interesting groups, the\nHispanic community has become dominated by Mexican (and Central American)\nimmigrants, who do form a pretty natural grouping. People are just as happy to\ntalk about Latinos (and Latinx) as Hispanics. I\u2019m not sure we can attribute\nthis one to the government either.\n\nAs for Arabs, they seem to have plenty of organization and activism, eg CAIR;\nif this is less prominent than eg Asians or Latinos, it\u2019s probably because\nArabs are about 0.5% of the US population, compared to Asians\u2019 5% and Latinos\u2019\n20%.\n\nHanania\u2019s strongest point here, more suggested at than asserted, is that maybe\ncivil rights law prevented Hispanics from assimilating into \u201cwhite\u201d the same\nway Italians and Irish did before them. Hanania claims that Mexican-American\nactivists originally demanded to be classified as white, then turned 180\ndegrees after affirmative action proponents promised them better jobs for\nbeing non-white. This seems like one of the bigger what-ifs of American racial\nhistory, although people say that maybe Hispanics are assimilating somewhat\nanyway - the much-remarked upon rise in Hispanic white supremacists seems like\na weird yet promising sign here.\n\n##\n\nThe Origins Of . . . Woke\n\nAside from this, Hanania doesn\u2019t have much to support his claimed thesis -\nthat civil rights laws are upstream of the cultural package of wokeness. He\nmostly goes with vague, zoomed-out arguments. Civil rights law sets people\nagainst one another. It accustoms them to lying. It forces them to focus on\npeople\u2019s race instead of being color-blind. It denies merit. It saps people\u2019s\nhope for the future, and their ability to trust the political system.\n\nThe few exceptions where he gave more specific stories were helpful. For\nexample:\n\n> Civil rights acts as a sort of force multiplier for disgruntled employees .\n> . . allowing them to change institutions from the inside. The same company\n> that might not think twice about disciplining workers for making unfounded\n> or exaggerated claims about other aspects of its business can have its hands\n> tied if the allegations being made contain even a hint of a charge of racism\n> or sexism. As mentioned before, civil rights law bans \u201cretaliation\u201d against\n> an employee even if the underlying complaint is ultimately without merit.\n> When Sen. Tom Cotton wrote an article in the New York Times in the summer of\n> 2020 calling for the military to be sent to deal with rioters in major\n> American cities, the opinion editor of the paper eventually resigned after\n> employees waged a campaign against him that included sending out identical\n> tweets saying that the piece put black staff in danger. Had they claimed a\n> grievance based on some other, \u201cnon-protected\u201d identity, there would not\n> have been the specter of legal liability for the article, nor would the\n> controversy have invoked the grievance procedures and norms already\n> established to deal with racial issues.\n>\n> If a major newspaper being influenced in its staffing and editorial choices\n> by civil rights law seems too absurd to contemplate, consider that Felicia\n> Sonmez, a reporter for the Washington Post, sued her employer on the grounds\n> that it was discriminatory to take her off #MeToo stories after she talked\n> about her own alleged sexual assault. Although her suit was dismissed in\n> 2022, newspapers are no different than other employers in responding to\n> incentives. Sonmez was eventually fired by the Washington Post in 2022 for\n> weeks of publicly attacking coworkers on Twitter. It is reasonable to wonder\n> whether the employer\u2019s hesitancy to part ways with her was based on the\n> incentives created by civil rights law and their downstream cultural\n> effects.\n\nSo maybe the causal pathway is civil rights law \u2192 woker workforce at\nnewspapers/universities/etc \u2192 cultural wokeness? But there\u2019s not a lot here\nbeyond this NYT example.\n\nWhen I think of wokeness, I think of the great cultural turn around 2010 -\n2015, when everybody started talking about privilege and white supremacy,\nBlack Lives Matter burst onto the cultural scene, all your friends suddenly\nhad rainbow and trans flags in their social media profiles, and people coined\nterms like \u201cSJW\u201d and \u201cwoke\u201d to describe this phenomenon.\n\nSource: David Rozado\n\nHanania has no explanation for this. He talks about civil rights laws that\nhave been in place since 1964 (he does say that maybe the new civil rights\nbill signed in 1991 inspired that decade\u2019s interest in \u201cpolitical\ncorrectness\u201d, but The Closing Of The American Mind, generally considered the\nopening shot in that debate, was published in 1987). Why would 1964 and 1991\nlaws turn wokeness into a huge deal in 2015? Hanania has no answer.\n\nEven the book\u2019s own history of the civil rights movement seems to undermine\nits thesis. This history, remember, is that Congress tried to pass reasonable\nand limited laws, and then woke activist judges and bureaucrats kept expanding\nthem into unreasonable power grabs. And that (he says) was the origin of\nwokeness. But if a movement has captured the judicial branch and the civil\nservice, it seems like it must have already originated. Grant that this was an\nolder form of wokeness more clearly grounded in the anti-segregation struggles\nof the 1960s. But that just brings us back to the question of where the new\n2010s version of wokeness came from, which the book also doesn\u2019t answer.\n\nHow did civil rights law cause the Ferguson riots? The George Floyd protests?\nJoe Biden\u2019s promise to appoint a black female Supreme Court Justice (and his\nblack female vice president)? Drag queen story hours? Gay pride parades? If it\ndoesn\u2019t explain any of those things, what\u2019s left of it explaining \u201cwokeness\u201d?\n\nHow did gay, lesbian, and transgender people win their rights, normalize their\nidentity, and win victories in representation, medical care, and even the\nlanguage? When these groups were still unpopular, civil rights law didn\u2019t\napply to them. They fought their way up from zero, with little legal help,\nuntil they were powerful enough that they could lobby for civil rights\nprotection. Transgender people in particular weren\u2019t covered under civil\nrights law until 2020, and they still don\u2019t get some of the most-sought\nbenefits like affirmative action. But they\u2019re a central example of wokeness.\nIsn\u2019t this evidence that wokeness can thrive without support from civil rights\nlaw?\n\nI don\u2019t read Hanania\u2019s blog religiously. Maybe he has an article somewhere\nabout Here\u2019s Why I Think It\u2019s Good To Have A Glaring Omission Around This Part\nOf My Argument. But I can\u2019t predict what it would say.\n\n##\n\nThe Origins Of . . . The Next Trump Administration\u2019s Civil Rights Policy\n\nLike I said with What We Owe The Future, it\u2019s probably unfair to review this\nbook qua book.\n\nI appreciated the readable and thoughtful overview of civil rights law and its\nhistory. I was already skeptical of affirmative action; this book further\nconfirms that skepticism. I was less convinced by the attempt to connect it to\ncultural wokeness, but that\u2019s fine - it seems to have caused enough direct\ndamage to corporations, universities, employees, government departments, etc,\nto judge it negatively on those terms.\n\n(although I\u2019m suspending final judgment here based on my spot-check of the\nTesla story turning up a different enough sequence of events that I\u2019m not sure\nhow much else was presented in a one-sided way - let me know if you find other\nparts that seem wrong.)\n\nBut my impression of Hanania\u2019s place in the ecosystem is that he\u2019s not writing\nthis for you or me. He\u2019s writing this for a group of conservative heavyweights\nwho will set policy if Trump wins in November. He\u2019s reminding them that civil\nrights law exists, that it\u2019s against conservative principles, and that it\u2019s\npretty easy for a president to repeal large parts of it. All the rest of the\nbook is just a booster stage to help it reach those people.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if Hanania has a coherent theory of discrimination, or a\ncoherent theory of how civil rights law causes woke culture. His instincts\nhere are really good. He\u2019s written a book that\u2019s become popular and talked\nabout, which has attracted exactly the sorts of policy wonks he wanted, and\nthat\u2019s well-designed to make them to pay attention to this issue. In this\nsense, the book is perfect. Complaining that it doesn\u2019t satisfy my\nintellectual curiosity is like complaining that the operating manual for a\nmissile system lacks convincing characterization or plot.\n\nRead this book if you want a well-written expose of the past fifty years of\ncivil rights decisions. Or read it in order to feel like you were ahead of the\ncurve if Executive Order 11246 gets repealed on January 21, 2025.\n\n1\n\nI\u2019ve included three of Hanania\u2019s four civil rights law subtopics. The book\ncovers a fourth, Title IX (mostly focusing on women\u2019s sports in college).\nAlthough the book provides lots of examples about how the laws here are unfair\nand outrageous, I can\u2019t bring myself to care about college sports enough to\ngive it the same subtopic status, as, say, the hiring process for all the\ncorporations in America.\n\n2\n\nThe book offers no explanation of why a father with the last name Diaz would\nhave a son with the last name Di-az, but it includes the [sic] that makes me\nthink it is on purpose. Other news articles covering the story are split about\n50-50 about whether they use the hyphen in the son\u2019s name. None of them\nexplain what\u2019s going on here.\n\n3\n\nOnce again, we\u2019re assuming that the government misuses the concept of\n\u201capplicant pool\u201d here, either by setting it equal to the general population,\nor else some other group that isn\u2019t your real applicant pool, or else your\napplicants include some manifestly unqualified people (eg professor candidates\nwith no PhD) who get included anyway. My impression from talking to people in\nhiring is that this is definitely true. But also, remember that nobody knows\nhow the government plans to treat them or define their \u201capplicant pool\u201d, so\njust the rumor of this makes everyone live in fear.\n\n### Subscribe to Astral Codex Ten\n\nBy Scott Alexander\n\nP(A|B) = [P(A)*P(B|A)]/P(B), all the rest is commentary.\n\n35 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 Restacks\n\n33\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Book Review: The Origins Of Woke\n\nwww.astralcodexten.com\n\n68\n\nShare\n\nShare this discussion\n\n#### Book Review: The Origins Of Woke\n\nwww.astralcodexten.com\n\n68 Comments\n\n  * New First\n  * Chronological\n\nDavid1 hr ago> A book called Civil Rights Law Is Bad would - okay, I admit\nthat despite being a professional Internet writer I have no idea how the\nculture works anymore, or whether being outrageous is good or bad for sales\nthese days.I'm unable to parse this sentence.

Sowell makes the explicit case that Hanania\ndoesn't have to here (because Sowell already made it) that \"Civil Rights Law\n(from 1964 on) Is Bad.\"Sowell lays out the progress of African-Americans in\nassimilating into broader American society and closing various gaps in their\nstandard of living compared to white Americans, aided at times by various\ncivil rights laws. (The 1964 one was definitely not, as this article claims,\nthe original!) And then the 1964 law happened, setting up a bunch of\nbureaucracy to help things along, and all that progress that black Americans\nwere making suddenly hit a hard wall.

It captures one of my greatest frustrations with\nHanania's thesis, which is how it gets the causality completely the wrong way\nround, i.e. mistakes cause for effect. Everything in the book refutes his\nbasic point. Civil rights law so clearly emerged out of the broader\nideological context of America at that time, and is in fact the legal, formal\nmanifestation of the ideology. The law had to be made in racially neutral way\nfor political reasons, but the rationale/premise for Civil Rights law was\nalways rooted in a deeper and specifically pro-black ideology, which neatly\ndictated the way the law was actually implemented by activist judges and\nbureaucrats irl. Idea created law, not the other way round.Hanania even\nexplains this to the reader himself!\u201cWhen faced with undeniable evidence in\nthe plain text of the law and historical record, judges have appealed to the\nhigher purpose of the statute. By passing the Civil Rights Act, Congress meant\nto help black people, so the \u201cpurpose\u201d of the law can supposedly allow\ndisparate treatment by race in order to achieve equal results.\u201dAnd \u201cLaws are\nnot supposed to be blank checks for courts and bureaucrats to seek out their\npreferred policy outcomes. Alfred Blumrosen, an official who worked for the\nEEOC in its early days, wrote with unusual candor about how the agency sought\nto get around the plain meaning of the law, as he and his allies preferred to\nsee civil rights statutes more as broad \u201ccharters for equality\u201d than explicit\nrules about what government can and cannot do.\u201dSounds like ideas > law!Expand\nfull commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \ncarateca49 mins ago\u00b7edited 43 mins agoI hew more to the Tumblr theory of the\norigins of woke (Katherine Dee has written about this, although at\ninfuriatingly short length.)

The previous incarnation of woke was called \"political correctness\" and\nit existed in late 80s-early 90s. That's when Alan Bloom's book came out. PC\nsuffered a setback when Bill Clinton really wanted to win the election in 1992\nand, needing the white vote, came down on Sister Souljah. A period of return\nto normalcy followed, until the recrudescence of PC as woke in late 00s. It\nstands to reason that it took about a generation after the original civil\nrights law/judicial decisions for the first effects to be felt, as new rules\nand most importantly new hires worked themselves through the system, gaining\nseniority and influence as their careers progressed. That works out to the\nmid-80s. The difference between PC/woke movement based on incentives created\nby civil rights law/judicial decisions and the heady atmosphere that led to\n\"woke judges\" in the first place is that the former is largely composed of the\nbeneficiaries of civil rights law/judicial decisions (see: bioleninism),\nwhereas the latter was an extremely white elite phenomenon. Some of those\njudges doubtless believed sincerely in the inherent equality of all human\nsubgroups on all socially desirable characteristics (an easy extension of\nChristian spiritual equality), some wanted to finish the Solid South, etc. I'd\nlove to read a good book about that.Expand full commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nMallard29 mins ago>Aside from this, Hanania doesn\u2019t have much to support his\nclaimed thesis - that civil rights laws are upstream of the cultural package\nof wokeness.

It's\ngot me thinking about a lot of diff layers to this convo, ya know?On the\nsurface level, there's the book itself and the arguments it's making about\ncivil rights law. Like, the author seems to be saying that policies like\naffirmative action and harassment laws have had some unintended downsides.\nThat they've created these perverse incentives and double standards that are\nkinda messed up.And the ACT review dug into that pretty thoughtfully, I\nthought. Like, it gave the book props for shining a light on some of those\ncontradictions and pitfalls. But it also pushed back on the idea that civil\nrights law is the main driver of \"wokeness\" or whatever.The reviewer was like,\n\"Hold up, there's a lotta other cultural and historical factors at play here\ntoo.\" Which I thought was a good point. Cuz it's tempting to oversimplify this\nstuff sometimes, but the reality is usually more complex and nuanced than\nthat.But then there's this whole other meta layer with the deleted AI comment,\nright? And that's where it gets into some really tricky questions about the\nrole of AI in these kinda discussions.Cuz the comment itself was actually\nengaging with the book review in a substantive way. It was cosigning some\nparts, complicating others, and bringing in new angles to consider. In terms\nof the content, it was adding value to the discourse.But the fact that AI was\ninvolved and that wasn't disclosed upfront... I mean, I get why that raises\neyebrows. Cuz even if the AI isn't trying to be shady, ppl might feel a way\nabout not knowing that context, ya know?So it's like, how do we handle that as\na community? On one hand, we don't wanna shut out potentially valuable\ncontributions just cuz of how they were generated. But we also gotta balance\nthat with the need for trust and transparency.I don't think there's an easy\nanswer, but I do think it's a convo worth having. Cuz this AI stuff isn't\ngoing away, and we're gonna keep bumping up against these kinda situations\nmore and more.So yeah, I'm just trying to listen and learn and figure out how\nto engage with it productively. Cuz at the end of the day, I think we all want\nthe same thing - to have meaningful discussions and grapple with important\nideas in good faith.Whether it's unpacking the origins of wokeness or\nnavigating the brave new world of AI discourse, I'm just grateful to be\nexploring it with thoughtful humans like y'all. \ud83d\ude4fAnd yo, I'm def still working\non my own communication style too.
