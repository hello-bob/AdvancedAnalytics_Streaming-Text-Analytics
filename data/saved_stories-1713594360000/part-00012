While some people learn better by reading and others by\nlistening, this article will explain why both options are beneficial and when\nto choose one over the other.\n\n### Junior vs Senior Developers\n\nWhen you're just starting out, many developers find themselves stuck in\ntutorial hell. A junior developer might believe that a YouTube video is more\nhelpful because they struggle with understanding documentation.\n\nHowever, watching multiple tutorials can be confusing because each instructor\nhas their own method of explaining things. This leads to a situation where one\nproblem has many solutions, which can be overwhelming for beginners.\n\n### Youtube Tutorials\n\nIt doesn't matter if you are a junior or senior developer; the way you watch\nYouTube tutorials should be consistent. Here's how I approached it when I was\na junior and how I still do it today.\n\nYouTube tutorials are better suited for larger problems, not minor issues like\n\"how to center a div.\" For instance, the topics I watch on YouTube involve\nproblems that require multiple pages of code, such as \"Django crash course,\"\n\"Kubernetes Overview,\" and \"Kotlin quickstart.\"\n\nSo, choose to watch a YouTube video before you start a new project or before\nyou begin developing a large feature. And watch just one; don't overcomplicate\nthings by watching multiple videos.\n\n### Documentation\n\nReading documentation is the most important thing and it will save you a lot\nof time. After watching your tutorial on Django, start by going through all\nthe documentation to quickly understand what it is about.\n\nSpending just a few minutes might not be enough. Instead, dedicate a good\nportion of your time, usually 20-30 minutes, to read through and understand\nthe material thoroughly. Don't skip sentences or pages.\n\nFor smaller tasks like \"how to create an ssl cert with certbot,\" read\neverything thoroughly and avoid jumping from website to website, as this can\nlead to wasting hours.\n\n### Only documentation\n\nAfter a few years of coding, I mostly read documentation, though I might watch\na video once a week. Reading tends to be more informative and faster. However,\nour modern lifestyle has led many to develop shorter attention spans, making\nit hard to focus on one thing for more than a minute.\n\nIf possible, I would recommend that 90% of your studying come from\ndocumentation. This approach will help you gain a deeper understanding and\nmore comprehensive knowledge of programming.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, coding tutorials and documentation are essential for developers\nat all levels. Tutorials help beginners by simplifying complex concepts and\noffering engaging visual and auditory learning. As developers advance, the\ndetailed structure of documentation becomes crucial, enhancing understanding\nand problem-solving skills. Balancing both resources based on context and\npersonal learning style is key for effective learning.\n\nThanks for reading, and I hope you found this article helpful.
