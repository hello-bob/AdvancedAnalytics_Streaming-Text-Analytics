Their symptoms were nondescript, but\ntheir milk production dramatically dropped and turned thick and creamy yellow.\nThe next day, cats on the farm that had consumed some of the raw milk from the\nsick cows also became ill. While the cows would go on to largely recover, the\ncats weren't so lucky. They developed depressed mental states, stiff body\nmovements, loss of coordination, circling, copious discharge from their eyes\nand noses, and blindness. By March 20, over half of the farm's 24 or so cats\ndied from the flu.\n\nIn a study published today in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases,\nresearchers in Iowa, Texas, and Kansas found that the cats had H5N1 not just\nin their lungs but also in their brains, hearts, and eyes. The findings are\nsimilar to those seen in cats that were experimentally infected with H5N1, aka\nhighly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI). But, on the Texas dairy farm,\nthey present an ominous warning of the potential for transmission of this\ndangerous and evolving virus.\n\nThe contaminated milk was the most likely source of the cat's fatal\ninfections, the study authors concluded. Although it can't be entirely ruled\nout that the cats got sick from eating infected wild birds, the milk they\ndrank from the sick cows was brimming with virus particles, and genetic data\nshows almost exact matches between the cows, their milk, and the cats.\n\"Therefore, our findings suggest cross-species mammal-to-mammal transmission\nof HPAI H5N1 virus and raise new concerns regarding the potential for virus\nspread within mammal populations,\" wrote the authors, who are veterinary\nresearchers from Iowa, Texas, and Kansas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe early outbreak data from the Texas farm suggests the virus is getting\nbetter and better at jumping to mammals, and data from elsewhere shows the\nvirus is spreading widely in its newest host. On March 25, the US Department\nof Agriculture confirmed the presence of H5N1 in a dairy herd in Texas,\nmarking the first time H5N1 had ever been known to cross over to cows. Since\nthen, the USDA has tallied infections in at least 34 herds in nine states:\nTexas, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, Idaho, Ohio, South Dakota, North\nCarolina, and Colorado.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration, meanwhile, has detected genetic traces of\nH5N1 in roughly 20 percent of commercial milk samples. While commercial milk\nis still considered safe\u2014pasteurization is expected to destroy the virus and\nearly testing by the FDA and other federal scientists confirms that\nexpectation\u2014the finding suggests yet wider spread of the virus among the\ncountry's milk-producing cows.\n\nCows are only the latest addition to H5N1's surprisingly broad host range.\nAmid a global outbreak over the past several years that has devastated wild\nbird populations and poultry farms, researchers have documented unexpected and\noften deadly outbreaks in mammals. Since 2022, the USDA has found H5N1 in over\n200 mammals, from big cats in zoos to harbor seals, mountain lions, raccoons,\nskunks, squirrels, polar bears, black bears, foxes, and bottlenose dolphins.\n\n\"The recurring nature of global HPAI H5N1 virus outbreaks and detection of\nspillover events in a broad host range is concerning and suggests increasing\nvirus adaptation in mammals,\" the authors wrote. \"Surveillance of HPAI viruses\nin domestic production animals, including cattle, is needed to elucidate\ninfluenza virus evolution and ecology and prevent cross-species transmission.\"\n\nIn the meantime, it's definitely not the time to start drinking raw cow's\nmilk. While drinking raw milk is always dangerous because it carries the\nthreat of various nasty bacterial infections, H5N1 also appears to be\ninfectious in raw milk. And, unlike other influenza viruses, H5N1 has the\npotential to infect organs beyond the lungs and respiratory tract, as seen in\nthe cats. The authors of the new study note that a 2019 consumer survey found\nthat 4.4 percent of adults in the US consumed raw milk more than once in the\nprevious year, suggesting more public awareness of the dangers of raw milk is\nnecessary.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n178\n\nBeth Mole Beth is Ars Technica\u2019s Senior Health Reporter.
