The\nimportance of market power today suggests that corporate tax policy should\ndistinguish between normal returns to capital and above-normal returns to\ncapital, the latter of which is a telling indicator of corporations\u2019 market\npower. This distinction has important consequences for the efficiency and\nequity of capital taxation.\n\nMarket power, alongside long-understood tax administration criteria,\nstrengthens an already-strong case for entity-level taxation. The corporate\ntax has the potential to distinguish companies based on the magnitude of their\nreported profits\u2014the larger the company\u2019s taxable income, the more likely that\na large share of their corporate tax payments are above-normal returns. The\nimplementation of a graduated corporate tax rate system, presented in this\nissue brief, has the potential to act as a constant nudge, tilting the playing\nfield in favor of more competitive markets.\n\nData indicate that the U.S. corporate tax base is very concentrated. In 2019,\nabout 350 companies (out of about 500,000 filers) account for nearly 70\npercent of the corporate tax base. Even among these top companies, total\nprofits are skewed toward the largest companies. Analysis within my working\npaper, to be published in the Spring 2024 issues of Tax Law Review, suggests\nthat the revenue gains from a graduated rate structure could be substantial,\nwhile affecting less than 2 in 1,000 corporations.\n\nAny proposal to raise corporate income taxes on the largest, most profitable\ncompanies will invariably spark questions about global profit shifting, and,\nindeed, international tax reform has an important role to play in enabling\nconsideration of a graduated U.S. corporate tax system. The largest\nmultinational companies often pay particularly low effective tax rates, due to\nfeatures of U.S. international tax law that facilitate and incentivize their\nability to shift taxable income toward low-tax jurisdictions. To tax these\nlarge companies, international tax reforms are needed to make the corporate\ntax base less tax-elastic.\n\nIn this regard, recent advances in international tax cooperation are an\nencouraging development. In 2021, more than 135 countries representing about\n95 percent of the world economy reached a political agreement to levy minimum\ntaxes on multinational companies, and recently, major countries have moved to\nimplement that agreement. The agreement also includes a feature\u2014the undertaxed\nprofits rule\u2014that will encourage adoption by other jurisdictions in the years\nahead.\n\nThis type of international tax cooperation is crucial for resolving\nlongstanding global collective action problems that have often resulted in a\nshift of the tax burden away from capital and toward labor or consumption,\nand, importantly for the topic of this issue brief, paves the way for an anti-\nmonopoly corporate tax in the United States.\n\n### Defining market power\n\nEconomists often distinguish between two types of firms when considering how\nto define market power. \u201cPerfectly\u201d competitive firms earn no \u201ceconomic\nprofit,\u201d or above-normal (excess) returns, but they do earn enough \u201caccounting\nprofit\u201d to pay the normal returns to capital and labor. The free entry and\nexit of firms in marketplaces assure that, over time, these perfectly\ncompetitive firms earn just the amount required to cover normal returns but no\nmore than that. Perfectly competitive firms do not have any control over the\nprices they face in the marketplace; they are \u201cprice-takers.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, \u201cimperfectly\u201d competitive firms face downward-sloping demand\ncurves for their output, meaning they have some control over the prices they\ncharge in the marketplace. Imperfectly competitive firms may, in some cases,\nearn profits above the amount required to cover normal returns to labor and\ncapital, generating economic profits (or excess returns). Firms may accumulate\nmarket power due to high barriers to entry into marketplaces, collusion with\nwould-be competitors, or simply the normal economic actions of dominant firms.\n\nIn this issue brief and in my working paper, I use the term \u201cmarket power\u201d to\ncapture situations where firms operate under conditions of imperfect\ncompetition, recognizing that there is a wide spectrum of possible outcomes,\nand market power becomes more policy-relevant when deviations from the\nperfectly competitive outcome are larger.\n\n### Market power and corporate taxation\n\nIn recent decades, and especially since 1990, the U.S. economy has experienced\ngrowing market concentration, alongside the increased market power of dominant\ncompanies. This trend of increasing market power has been sustained and\nsubstantial, and it has occurred across a broad swath of U.S. industries.\nThese trends have important implications for the U.S. economy, affecting the\nbargaining power of firms relative to workers, inequality, consumer welfare,\nthe efficiency of capital allocation, and the broader functioning of markets.\n\nIncreasing market power also has important implications for tax policy.\nLongstanding tax analyses that treat capital taxes as falling on the \u201cnormal\u201d\nreturn to capital have efficiency implications that are very different from\nthose that hold if capital taxes instead fall on profits above the normal\nreturn to capital. The incidence of capital taxes also depends on whether they\nfall on normal or excess returns. The optimal rate of capital taxation depends\ncrucially on such efficiency and incidence considerations.\n\nThe ideal form of capital taxation also depends on these distinctions.\nAlongside administrative rationale, market power considerations strengthen the\nargument for the corporate tax as an important tool for achieving capital\ntaxation goals. Further, market power considerations buttress the case for a\ngraduated system of corporate tax rates.\n\nThe large role of market power reinforces the already-powerful case for\ntackling international tax competition and countering international tax\navoidance. While international tax reform entails balancing the competing\ngoals of tax base protection with the competitiveness concerns of domestic\nmultinational companies, recent improvements in international tax cooperation\nmake that trade-off less stark. Further, the policy relevance of such\ncompetitiveness concerns is impacted by the presence of market power.\n\nThe importance of market power strengthens the argument for taxing capital\nincome at the entity level, rather than the individual level, though there are\nalready important reasons to favor taxation at the entity level. First,\nentity-level taxation is simply more comprehensive. About 70 percent of all\nU.S. equity income is completely untaxed by the U.S. government at the\nindividual level. Why? Because this income is either held by untaxable\nentities, such as nonprofit endowments, or in untaxed accounts, including\nretirement accounts, pensions, and college savings accounts, or in foreign\nhands whose governments may or may not tax that income. (See Figure 1.)\n\nFigure 1\n\n#### Ownership of U.S. corporate stock, including both direct and indirect\nholdings, 1965 to 2015\n\nSource: Leonard E. Burman, Kimberly A. Clausing, and Lydia Austin, \u201cIs U.S.\nCorporate Income Double-Taxed?\u201d National Tax Journal 70 (3) (2017): 675\u2013706,\navailable at https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/us-corporate-income-\ndouble-taxed.\n\nUnless many popular tax preferences are reconsidered, much of the capital\nincome tax base is unreachable if one is limited to the individual layer of\ntaxation. Further, the entity level of taxation is the only way to reach most\nforeign investors in U.S. equity markets. These investors also benefit from\nthe features of the U.S. economy that generate U.S. equity income, so the\nentity layer of tax is one way to ensure that foreign investors contribute to\nfinancing the relevant government services.\n\nSecond, even for those accounts that are taxable by the U.S. government, the\ntaxpayer has substantial discretion over when, and indeed if, capital taxation\noccurs. While corporate dividends may trigger immediate taxation, capital\ngains are only taxed at realization, so taxpayers can defer taxation (allowing\nfunds to grow free of tax) indefinitely. Further, if assets are held until\ndeath, they qualify for a \u201cstep-up\u201d in basis, so that capital gains escape\ntaxation entirely. Any shares donated to charity will also escape taxation.\n\nFinally, entity-level taxation can also serve as an important backstop for the\nindividual income tax, preventing those individuals with discretion from\nchanneling funds into corporations, retaining earnings, and obtaining lower\ntax rates as a consequence. The more the corporate rate falls below the top\nindividual rate (or pass-through rate), the more the corporate form acts as a\ntax shelter.\n\nBeyond these rationales, the presence of significant and rising market power\nmakes the argument for the corporate tax stronger. The corporate tax has long\nplayed an important role as a regulatory device. Governments can use the tax\nsystem to influence the behavior of corporate actors. Corporate investment is\nspurred through rounds of bonus depreciation, research and development is\nincentivized through the R&D tax credit, and other activities such as clean\nenergy, low-income housing, and the development of orphan drugs (treating rare\ndiseases) are encouraged through general business credits.\n\nIn a similar manner, the more that the corporate tax base overlaps with a tax\nbase that is solely excess profits, the greater the efficiency justification\nfor the corporate tax. Taxing excess profits generates government revenue,\nallowing society as a whole to share in the fruits of the exercise of market\npower (or the fruits of luck or risk-taking), without deterring investment or\neconomic activity. Indeed, if the corporate tax fell onlyon excess profits,\none could justify (on efficiency grounds) much higher tax rates than today\u2019s\n21 percent rate, especially if one could address international mobility\nissues.\n\nPrior to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, there was a modest graduated rate in\nthe corporate tax rate structure, but most of the corporate tax was paid by\ncorporations that were at the top marginal rate of 35 percent, which applied\nat the $10 million income threshold. A slightly lower 34 percent marginal rate\napplying for income between $75,000 and $10 million, and lower marginal rates\nof 25 percent and 15 percent applied for income below $75,000 and $50,000,\nrespectively.\n\nSince 2018, the corporate tax has been levied as a flat 21 percent rate. There\nis a good argument for a flat rate of tax. Unlike the individual income tax, a\ngraduated rate in the corporate arena need not improve progressivity. For\ninstance, we do not know that wealthier people are more likely to own shares\nin the most profitable corporations (as opposed to less profitable ones),\nrelative to those lower in the income distribution. Thus, a graduated rate\nstructure is an indirect (and potentially ineffective) way to achieve\nprogressivity goals.\n\nYet the larger the company\u2019s taxable income, the more likely that a large\nshare of their corporate tax payments are above-normal returns. In my working\npaper, I detail why the U.S. tax code provides favorable or neutral treatment\nto many types of investment (subsidizing debt-financed investment and allowing\nexpensing or favorable depreciation regimes in many instances), such that\nthere is a large overlap between the corporate tax base and a tax base on\nrents. Thus, companies that comprise a large share of the corporate tax base\nare also likely to be those earning rents. Further, the Fortune or Forbes\nlists of the most profitable companies show that many of them benefit from\nlarge market shares, and many are in fields\u2014such as technology,\npharmaceuticals, or finance\u2014where intangible capital (the normal return to\nwhich is untaxed) is an important source of value.\n\nSince taxing above-normal returns is both more efficient and particularly\nlikely to burden shareholders, a higher tax rate may be justified. By\ncontrast, for less profitable companies, more of the corporate tax burden may\nfall on investment or labor.\n\nBeyond these favorable incidence effects, a graduated corporate tax can also\ndiscourage size itself, as well as the accumulation of economic power, which\nhas negative consequences for the broader economy. A graduated rate does not\ndistinguish among the causes of size\u2014which could result from economies of\nscale, luck or first-mover advantages, risk-taking, access to some key\nresource, or other factors\u2014but it does tilt the tax playing field against\nlarge-profit companies relative to small-profit companies, improving the\ncompetitive environment in a clear and transparent manner.\n\nWhile a somewhat-higher tax rate will not prevent companies from becoming\nlarge, which may be warranted or even desirable in many instances, it will act\nas a marginal disincentive for mergers, acquisitions, and agglomeration\nitself.\n\nEuropean Union antitrust authorities have been active, and U.S. antitrust\nefforts appear to be on the rise, but it is difficult for antitrust law to\naddress many prevalent instances of market power. Antitrust processes require\ndue deliberation, focus on different criteria for market power, can be slow,\nand often act as a blunt on/off switch, rather than as a continuous policy\nlever. While company mergers have been blocked on occasion, and there have\nbeen instances of fines or regulation, antitrust remedies are generally\ninfrequent.\n\nTax policy reform cannot replace antitrust policy (nor should it), but it can\nbe a useful complement that provides a continuous policy signal in favor of a\nmore competitive marketplace. A higher tax on more profitable companies, for\nexample, would provide a direct and transparent tax preference for companies\noperating in a relatively competitive environment, compared to those that are\nmore insulated from competition. And given the distribution of corporate\nprofits and tax payments in the United States, even a small hike in the rate\nat the top could have large revenue consequences.\n\n### Enacting a graduated global U.S. corporate tax system\n\nOne way to enact a graduated global U.S. corporate tax system could keep the\ncorporate rate at its present level of 21 percent for smaller-profit\ncompanies, while raising the corporate tax rate for those companies with\nhigher profits. Marginal rates would be calculated as they are presently under\nthe individual income tax system, so that the increased rate would only apply\nto income above the thresholds in question. Table 1 illustrates one possible\ngraduated corporate tax rate schedule.\n\nTable 1\n\n#### Example of graduated global U.S. corporate tax rate schedule\n\nSource: Kimberly Clausing, \u201cCapital Taxation and Market Power\u201d (SSRN, December\n2023), available at\nhttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4419599.\n\nIn Table 1, corporate taxpayers with $2 billion in income, for example, would\npay 21 percent on their first $100 million in income, 25 percent on $900\nmillion of their income, and 30 percent on $1 billion of their income, for a\ntotal tax bill of $546 million and an average tax rate of 27.3 percent.\nImportantly, a graduated rate of corporate taxation was, until recently, a\nfeature of the corporate tax, so this sort of rate structure is not\nunprecedented. And, under current law, there are many provisions that are more\nfavorable for small companies, as well as some base protection measures that\nonly affect large companies.\n\nExamples of the former include special expensing rules under Section 179,\nunder which approximately $1 million of investment can be deducted, and the\nfavorable treatment is phased out at higher investment levels (above about\n$2.9 million). Examples of the latter include 163(j) interest limits, which\naffect only those taxpayers with more than $27 million in receipts in 2022,\nand the base-erosion anti-abuse tax, or BEAT for short, which affects those\nwith average annual gross receipts of $500 million or more. Indeed, the BEAT\nexists to counter avoidance opportunities that are far more likely to occur\namong large companies.\n\nWhile publicly available IRS data do not allow an investigation of the exact\nbreakdowns of Table 1, one can examine proximate statistics for 2019, the most\nrecent year not affected by the COVID-19 pandemic (though 2020 data lead to\nsimilar inferences). (See Figure 2.)\n\nFigure 2\n\n#### Distribution of corporate taxpayers and corporate tax payments, 2019\n\nSource: IRS, Department of the Treasury, Pub. 16, \u201cStatistics of Income \u2013 2019\nCorporation Income Tax Returns Complete Report,\u201d available at\nhttps://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p16.pdf. See Table 4.\n\nIt is readily apparent that most corporations would be untouched by the tax-\nbracket reform that is illustrated in Table 1. Of the approximately 500,000\ncorporate tax returns filed in 2019, fewer than 2,000 of them had tax payments\nof more than $10 million (and thus taxable income nearing $50 million).\nIndeed, about 99.7 percent of corporate taxpayers fall below those thresholds,\nand thus even more would be excluded from the reform suggested above.\n\nBut most of the tax base would be affected by this reform, since 87 percent of\nthe tax payments are made by corporations above the $10 million tax payment\nthreshold, and 69 percent of all corporate tax is paid by companies with tax\npayments of more than $100 million (and thus with taxable income nearing $500\nmillion). The average company with more than $100 million in tax payments has\n$2.4 billion in taxable income (after tax credits).\n\nConsider the revenue effects of this reform in 2019 under two (restrictive)\nassumptions: There is no behavioral response, and each corporation has a\nsituation that is the average of those in their IRS segment. In that event,\ntax burdens would only increase for fewer than 2 out of 1,000 corporations.\nFor those with tax payments between $10 million and $50 million, very little\nof the average company\u2019s taxable income after credits (which averages $106\nmillion) would be subject to an additional 4 percent tax. There are 272\ntaxpayers with tax payments between $50 million and $100 million, who have an\naverage taxable income of $341 million, so about 71 percent of their income\nwould have an additional 4 percent tax rate applied, generating about $3\nbillion in tax revenue.\n\nFor the 353 companies with tax payments of more than $100 million at present,\nwho have an average taxable income of $2.4 billion (after credits), about 58\npercent of their income would be taxed at 30 percent, and another 37 percent\nof their income would be taxed at 25 percent. This group would generate about\n$57 billion in additional tax revenue.\n\nAcross these two groups, tax revenues would increase by about $60 billion in\n2019, an increase of 30 percent relative to the baseline. This revenue\nincrease is an underestimate in one respect, since assuming everyone in the\ntop bracket is an \u201caverage\u201d company removes any additional revenue associated\nwith the 35 percent bracket for those companies with more than $10 billion in\nprofits.\n\nData from the Fortune 500 list covering the year 2019 suggest that there are\nabout 13 U.S. companies with more than $15 billion in worldwide profits,\nsuggesting they might be above the $10 billion threshold in U.S. profits.\nTogether, these companies generate about $273 billion in profit above the $10\nbillion threshold. An additional 5 percent tax on that base would generate $14\nbillion in additional revenue. Approximately one-third to one-half of U.S.\ncorporate profits are foreign profits, so this suggests perhaps about $7\nbillion to $9 billion in additional U.S. tax, bringing the total to about $68\nbillion.\n\nThese calculations do not account for behavioral response, but one would\nexpect behavioral response along at least three margins. First, if companies\nface higher tax burdens, they may do less real activity. Given the target\npopulation of companies, this is not a big concern, since these companies have\nlarge excess profits, and the additional tax is unlikely to fall on the normal\nreturn to capital, so it would be relatively nondistortionary.\n\nSecond, and more significant, large companies have other ways to respond to\nhigher tax burdens. For instance, they may seek to shift profits toward lower-\ntax destinations. This would be true even if size thresholds were set based on\nglobal income, if the tax base were determined by U.S. reported income. This\nissue is the most important hurdle to adopting this proposal, and it will be\naddressed in detail below.\n\nThird, larger companies may split into smaller companies (or do fewer mergers\nand acquisitions) in order to avoid the higher rates of tax felt by larger\ncompanies. If a split were a mere formality, such that ownership and control\nof the company remained as before, that would circumvent the higher tax\nburdens for large companies. But the law should ensure that companies would be\nconsolidated for tax purposes if they were not truly separate, and prior law\n(when the corporate rate structure was graduated) had provisions to address\nthis issue.\n\nWith a tight definition of commonality, companies would only be able to\nseparate if they were truly willing to give up the benefits of internalization\nthat result from their combination. Such internalization benefits can be\nsignificant. For instance, internalization resolves principal-agent problems,\nhelping to align the profit-maximizing incentives within the group.\nInternalization allows economies of scale (cost reductions due to greater\nproduction scale), economies of scope (cost reductions due to producing a\nlarger number of complementary goods), and synergies associated with\ncooperative product or service development. When companies break up, they lose\nmany of these advantages.\n\nThe hypothetical tax schedule in Table 1 above attempts to balance two\nconsiderations. First, scale economies may be beneficial, generating cost\nsavings that benefit consumers, resources that fund innovation, and the\ncapacity to absorb risk. One wouldn\u2019t want to eliminate the possibility of\nlarge companies and the attendant advantages of scale.\n\nThere also are disadvantages associated with market domination. Concentration\nof economic power may generate serious negative consequences: depressing wages\nor employment, systematically lowering the labor share of income, impeding\nhealthy market competition, harming consumer welfare, and corrupting public\npolicy processes. Given these factors, it would be useful to have a public\npolicy tool that counters excessive agglomeration of economic power.\n\nWhile antitrust law also has an important role to play, the objective of\nantitrust law can be usefully complemented by a tax code that, at minimum,\ndoes not incentivize market concentration, and instead works to promote market\ncompetition. The tax code can act as an ever-present nudge in this area, as in\nso many others, by incrementally changing marginal incentives.\n\nIndeed, the tax code is a statement of values. It encourages things such as\nclean energy and research by offering them low tax burdens. In this case,\nmarket power can be discouraged by levying a somewhat higher tax on those\nfirms most likely to exercise it. This has the salutary effect of allowing\nsociety to benefit from those activities that generate above-normal profits,\nproviding an efficient source of finance for fiscal priorities.\n\nAt present, the tax code often tilts the playing field in the other direction.\nLarge, profitable multinational companies pay lower rates than smaller\ndomestic companies, often by a substantial margin. In part, this is because\nmultinational companies can avail themselves of opportunities to shift profit\noffshore, toward jurisdictions with rock-bottom tax rates. These low tax rates\nadvantage large multinational companies relative to their smaller, less\nprofitable peers, turbocharging market concentration.\n\nFurther, the causality can go the other way too, as market power fuels tax\navoidance. Sophisticated multinational tax avoidance techniques often entail\nsizable fixed costs, and large profits provide the resources to invest in this\nexpertise. Large companies also invest more in political activity, which can\nbear large fruits in terms of more favorable tax or regulatory environments.\nIn turn, successful political activity provides policy advantages that fuel\nconcentration.\n\n### Implications for international tax reform\n\nThe most important objection to taxing large, profitable companies at higher\nrates in a graduated U.S. corporate tax system is that such companies are\nparticularly adept at shifting income offshore. Therefore, any higher tax\nrates for the most profitable companies should be accompanied by associated\nmeasures that combat international profit shifting.\n\nThere are different approaches to tackle profit shifting, but a central aim is\nto reduce the elasticity of the corporate tax base. Some have suggested full\nworldwide consolidation, which would require resident firms to pay tax on\ntheir global income alongside their domestic income; foreign tax credits would\nprevent double taxation. This would end the incentive to shift income\noffshore, although it would put pressure on the definition of residence, so\naccompanying reforms would need to reduce the elective nature of tax residence\nby using a management and control criterion and by employing measures to\ncounter corporate inversions. A bill introduced by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse\n(D-RI) in the current U.S. Congress takes a similar approach.\n\nOne daunting concern with such reforms is that they would hamper the\ninternational competitiveness of U.S.-headquartered multinational companies in\nglobal markets if foreign income were taxed more heavily than that of their\ncompetitors. While this form of competitiveness is a concern, it is less of a\nconcern for those companies that wield substantial market power.\n\nFurther, it is also useful to note that the competitiveness of the United\nStates as a place for U.S. multinational companies to undertake economic\nactivity and book profits would be improved. Unlike current law, there would\nbe no tax advantage associated with operating in lower-tax countries, so\nU.S.-based companies would face no tax distortions in their location decisions\nregarding where to deploy investments or hire workers.\n\nA more modest reform would simply narrow the existing tax preference favoring\nforeign income over domestic income. Under current law, the so-called GILTI\nprovision, which stands for \u201cglobal intangible low tax income,\u201d exempts the\nfirst 10 percent return on foreign tangible assets from U.S. tax, and income\nabove that threshold is taxed with a 50 percent deduction relative to domestic\nincome. This provides a large incentive to earn income offshore.\n\nIn President Joe Biden\u2019s budgets for fiscal years 2022, 2024, and 2025, the\nadministration proposed eliminating the tax-free return on foreign tangible\nassets, reducing the deduction for foreign income to 25 percent, and\ncalculating the tax burden on foreign income on a country-by-country basis.\nTogether, these changes would have substantially reduced the incentive to\nshift profit offshore, lowering the elasticity of the tax base.\n\nIn November 2021, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a reform that would\nmove in this direction, applying the GILTI tax on foreign income on a country-\nby-country basis, lowering the deduction for low-taxed foreign income, and\nreducing the tax-free return on foreign tangible assets to 5 percent. The U.S.\nSenate did not pass a similar reform, but instead legislated a corporate\nalternative minimum tax; this reform will slightly raise the tax burden on\nforeign income for some multinational companies.\n\nThe country-by-country feature of GILTI reforms is important. It further\nreduces the incentive to earn income in low-tax jurisdictions offshore, since\nthe resulting U.S. tax cannot be offset with tax credits from higher-tax\nlocations.\n\nThe GILTI provision operates as a deduction from the normal corporate rate;\nthus, whatever GILTI design is adopted, it can accommodate higher corporate\ntax rates (such as those envisioned in the prior section) with proportionate\nchanges in the tax rate that would apply to low-taxed income abroad. Yet the\nhigher the U.S. rate on foreign income relative to the lightest possible\ntreatment of foreign competitors, the more corporations will fear negative\ncompetitiveness impacts. Still, it is important to bear in mind that the\nhigher corporate tax rates envisioned in the prior section are triggered by\nthe exceptionally high corporate profits earned by dominant corporations; this\nshould alleviate competitiveness concerns.\n\nSince competitiveness concerns also hold in many countries abroad, this\nprovides a strong argument for international tax cooperation. Left to their\nown devices, governments often behave as players in a noncooperative game,\nlowering their tax rate to attract tax base and activity from other countries.\nSince all countries face similar incentives, tax rates are too low relative to\nwhat would be chosen if countries could coordinate.\n\nLuckily, countries cancoordinate, although such coordination is never easy.\nStill, in 2021, more than 135 jurisdictions accounting for about 95 percent of\nthe world economy agreed to transformative reforms in international tax rules,\nincluding a global country-by-county minimum tax of 15 percent. This\nOECD/G20/Inclusive Framework agreement responds to the \u201crace to the bottom\u201d\ndynamic in international taxation by raising the bottom, from 0 percent (the\napproximate tax rate currently levied by some important low-tax jurisdictions)\nto 15 percent.\n\nFurther, the agreement is strengthened by an undertaxed profits rule, or UTPR,\nwhich allows adopting countries to top-up tax burdens for companies operating\nin their markets that are headquartered in nonadopting countries. Such an\nenforcement mechanism should encourage widespread adoption once a few major\neconomies adopt. Otherwise, companies based in nonadopting countries will\nstill face top-up taxes when they operate in adopting countries\u2014the resulting\nrevenue will just accrue to adopting country governments instead of their home\ngovernments.\n\nIn December 2022, the European Union unanimously moved forward to implement\nthis country-by-country minimum tax by issuing a Council Directive. In\naddition, many other countries, including South Korea, Japan, Australia,\nCanada, and the United Kingdom, are also implementing this minimum tax.\nHopefully, the United States will soon follow suit.\n\nBased on current implementation plans, OECD researchers have concluded that 90\npercent of the multinational companies that are in the scope of the agreement\nwill be covered by its provisions. Of course, this agreement is not perfect.\nSome forms of tax competition will persist, as countries may offer subsidies\nor refundable tax credits in place of low tax rates. That said, such measures\nare more difficult for countries to adopt, as they entail direct budgetary\ncosts, not just foregone revenue. Thus, the constraint on tax competition\nprovided by this agreement is a real one, and it is an important step forward.\n\nIn the end, the elasticity of the corporate tax base is a choice. And there\nare multiple options for reducing the elasticity of the corporate tax base. In\nthe near term, the most practical way forward is to build on the momentum\ncreated by the international agreement. International adoption of the\nOECD/G20/Inclusive Framework agreement will help limit tax competition\npressures and reduce profit-shifting incentives.\n\nForeign adoption of these reforms also supports U.S. international tax reforms\nthat strengthen the GILTI provision, reducing the current tax preference that\nfavors foreign income relative to U.S. income. First, foreign adoption of\nminimum taxes reduces any competitiveness concerns associated with a stronger\nGILTI provision, which could otherwise create sizable gaps between U.S.\ntreatment of foreign income and rules abroad.\n\nSecond, foreign adoption of the undertaxed profits rule causes U.S.\nmultinational companies to face top-up taxes abroad in adopting countries.\nThus, these companies would still face 15 percent tax burdens on their foreign\nincome, but the revenue would go to foreign governments instead of the U.S.\ngovernment, giving the U.S. government a strong incentive to adopt conforming\nGILTI reforms.\n\nFurther, without adoption of aligned reforms, U.S. multinational companies\nwould risk facing several overlapping minimum tax regimes. Current U.S. law\nincludes the GILTI provision and a Base Erosion and Anti-abuse Tax, or BEAT.\nForeign governments will also levy UTPR taxes. In addition, there is the new\ncorporate alternate minimum tax, or CAMT. (The CAMT was part of the Inflation\nReduction Act of 2022. It taxes companies with more than $1 billion in book\nincome at a rate of 15 percent, but it contains special features to avoid\nclawing back existing investment incentives, R&D incentives, or general\nbusiness credits. It does not include a country-by-country minimum tax on\nforeign income.)\n\nWith reform of the U.S. international tax rules, as suggested by recent Biden\nadministration proposals, these taxes could conceivably be consolidated, as\nU.S. companies would no longer pay UTPR taxes abroad, and there would be far\nless need for the CAMT (especially for multinational companies) or the BEAT.\n\n### Other ways to combat market power through the tax code\n\nThere are additional ways to improve existing U.S. tax laws to better address\nmarket power concerns. For instance, the design of the foreign-derived\nintangible income, or FDII, deduction is perverse, since it provides a tax\nbreak for above-normal returns to some income, relative to normal returns.\nUnder the FDII, companies receive a deduction of 37.5 percent (scheduled to\nfall to 21.9 percent in 2026) on their income above a 10 percent return on\nqualified business asset investment if that income is derived from exports.\nThis provision should be repealed. It serves no economic purpose to favor\nexcess profits, and it is an indirect (at best) way to incentivize the\ndevelopment of intangible property in the United States, which would be better\ntargeted by measures that focus more narrowly on research and development.\n\nAnother area where tax policy might be reconsidered is that of tax-free\nreorganizations. Global mergers have surged in recent years, reaching $5\ntrillion in value in 2021. Mergers can spur market concentration, and while\nthey may generate efficiencies, many mergers fail to do so. Under U.S. tax\nlaw, some mergers can be structured to be tax free, when the acquiring firm\nexchanges some of its stock for target-firm stock; tax is then deferred until\nthe underlying asset is later sold. While there are justifications for such\nfavorable tax treatment, there are also counterarguments, and rising market\npower provides a strong rationale for reconsidering this tax preference.\n\nIdeally, tax provisions would instead provide lessfavorable treatment to very-\nhigh-profit large companies. Under the proposed international reforms and the\nnew CAMT, minimum tax regimes would only apply to large companies, although\nthe thresholds vary. As this issue brief and my more comprehensive working\npaper argue, that focus on large companies makes good economic sense, as the\ncorporate tax is more likely to serve both efficiency and fairness goals when\nlevied on above-normal returns to capital, and above-normal returns are more\nlikely for companies with high profits.\n\n### Compliance costs and tax administration concerns\n\nAdministrative complexity provides another reason to focus such provisions on\nlarge companies. Large companies have more tax-avoidance opportunities, both\ndue to their international reach, which allows them to exploit variations in\ntax treatment across jurisdictions, and due to their scale, which helps them\nafford the fixed costs associated with setting up tax-avoidance structures.\nThe large scale of these companies also helps them comply with complicated new\ntax provisions, including the minimum taxes described here. While such\nprovisions can be dauntingly complex, the largest companies have the resources\nrequired to handle complexity.\n\nAdministering graduated corporate tax brackets, as envisioned above, would be\nstraightforward, as applying tax brackets is a simple part of compliance and\nenforcement. Yet because higher rates would put additional pressure on\ninternational profit-shifting incentives, improving international tax\nrules\u2014and providing the IRS with sufficient resources to administer such\nrules\u2014are especially important.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMarket power is an important force in both the U.S. economy and the world, and\na wealth of evidence indicates that market power has become increasingly\nimportant in the past few decades. While the scale economies and network\neffects that are associated with market power generate efficiencies, they also\ngenerate policy concerns, through possible detrimental effects on income\ninequality, labor bargaining power, consumer welfare, and market dynamism.\n\nThe importance of market power suggests rethinking common corporate tax policy\ndesign concepts. Most important, tax policy should distinguish the normal\nreturn to capital from the above-normal return to capital. This distinction\nhas important consequences for the efficiency and equity of capital taxation.\n\nMarket power, alongside long-understood tax administration criteria,\nstrengthens an already-strong case for entity-level taxation. The corporate\ntax has the potential to distinguish companies based on the magnitude of their\nreported profits: The larger the company\u2019s taxable income, the more likely\nthat a large share of their corporate tax payments are above-normal returns. A\ngraduated corporate tax rate system has the potential to act as a constant\nnudge, tilting the playing field in favor of more competitive markets.\n\nInternational tax reform has an important role to play in enabling\nconsideration of such reforms by strengthening governments\u2019 ability to tax the\nlargest multinational companies and making the corporate tax base less tax\nelastic. Recent advances in international tax cooperation are encouraging, due\nto the coordinated implementation of minimum taxes on multinational company\nincome. In the years ahead, this agreement can be further improved to allow\njurisdictions more tax policy autonomy in addressing both market power and\nfiscal needs.\n\n\u2014Kimberly Clausing is the Eric M.
