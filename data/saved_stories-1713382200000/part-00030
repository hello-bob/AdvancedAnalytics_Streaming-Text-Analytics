With the update the bridge\nhas become the only available option for Axie marketplace, breeding, and\nmorphing contracts.\n\nThe idea for the project comes from the fact that on the Binance Exchange the\nhighest earning product in Locked staking is AXS with an estimated APY of\n131.25% far outperforming any similar prooduct on the exchange.\n\nIn order to justify such returns the company would usually rely on large\ninflows and minor outflows from the cryptocurrency. Therefore, monitoring the\nmost liquid day-to-day endpoints provides an indicator of the success of the\nstaking solution.\n\n# Triggers\n\n### Trigger for Token transfer from or to Binance Account of SPL or AXS token\non Ethereum\n\nApart from collecting the data from the transaction we collect data using\nChainlink and CryptoRank.\n\n    \n    \n    stream _ from TokenTransfers where (@from == AXScontract || @to == AXScontract || @from == Binance14 || @to == Binance14) && (@erc20.symbol == \"AXS\" || @erc20.symbol == \"SLP\") process let symb = @erc20.symbol let cryptorankFiatRate = getRate(symb) let fiat_value = @value * cryptorankFiatRate.value let fiat_decimals = @erc20.decimals + cryptorankFiatRate.decimals let eth_usd_pair = getChainlinkPriceFeedPair(\"ETH/USD\") let score_from = getScore(@from) let score_to = getScore(@to) emit {@action_type, @block_hash, @code_address, @from, @gas_used, @origin, @to, @value, fiat_value, fiat_decimals, eth_usd_pair, @tx_hash, symb, @block_timestamp, @gas_price, score_from, score_to } end\n\n### Trigger for Token transfer from or to Binance Accounts of AXS token on Bsc\n\n    \n    \n    stream _ from BscBEP20Transfers where @token.contract == ContractBSC && (@from in BSCdata || @to in BSCdata ) process emit { @from, @to, @value, @token, @transaction, @block } end\n\n# User Data\n\nPrimitives\n\nTable\n\n# Results\n\n### Data and Notebook\n\n  * Binance Smart Chain Data\n\n  * Ethereum Data\n\n  * Python Notebook on Kaggle\n\n## Analysis\n\n### Ethereum Axie Infinity\n\nThere are 231 AXS token transactions in our ethereum dataset. Only 46 are from\nRonin and Binance accounts.\n\nMeanwhile, the rest 80% are coming to the Ronin and Binance accounts.\n\nThere are also more transactions to the native staking solution rather than\nBinance by a factor of 2.\n\nNevertheless, when we analyze the volume of outflows vs. inflows the sum of\noutflows dominate.\n\nThis would indicate more incoming users and one or few significant withdrawals\nfrom Binance.\n\nWe look at the more granular data and notice that one account is responsible\nfor such bleak snapshot of AXS flows.\n\nWe plot full ethereum dataset value of transactions against time.\n\nWhen plotted the inflows have a lot of spikes and more numerous for Binance.\n\nWhile the outflows are more steady.\n\nThe following picture is very similar for only AXS. With two spikes in Binance\noutflows against 0 in Ronin Bridge.\n\nWe would need to further incorporate more data in our analysis to determine\nthe scope of weekly and monthly flows in AXS token.\n\n### BSC AXS\n\nIn our BSC dataset we have 157 observations. The count of transactions is in\nfavour of outflows from Binance Hot Wallets.\n\nWhereas the sum of transferred AXS value out of binance is nearly identical to\nthe inflows.\n\n### Comparison of AXS on BSC and Ethereum\n\nThe volume of transactions is much greater on Ethereum of AXS than on Binance\nSmart Chain.\n\n### Score of the addresses (in-built PARSIQ function)\n\nIn our AXS dataset on Ethereum we also obtained scores for addresses by using\ngetScore in our trigger.\n\nWhat is interesting is that the system scores higher the Binance account (85)\nrather than Ronin Bridge (76).\n\nBesides, the average address that transacts to Ronin has score of 79. For\nBinance this figure is 80. For outflows the number is 79 for Ronin and 77 for\nBinance.\n\n# Further Resources\n\n  * CryptoPunks with PARSIQ Github Repository\n  * Axie Infinity Great Migration FAQ\n  * This Project as a blog post\n\n## About\n\nIn this project we utilize PARSIQ Smart Triggers and Google Spreadsheets\nintegration to track and visualize AXS token transfers on Ethereum and Binance\nSmart Chain that with the most liquid exchanges.\n\ndspyt.com/blockchain-insights-with-parsiq-triggers-for-axie-infinity/\n\n### Topics\n\ncsv ethereum jupyter-notebook python3 axie-infinity parsiq dspyt\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nMIT license\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n6 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n2 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n2 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n  * Jupyter Notebook 100.0%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
