The most recent implementation was created\nin 2000 for the Nokia 9110 cell phone. A version for Linux is reported to be\nimplemented \"any day now\".\n\nIn 1984 Noko was hired by goverment-own company called Nokia. Nokolisp was\nused to create various programming tools like TNCODE, TNANAL and TNSDL.\n\nWhen Noko lost his job in Nokia Corporation in 1990, Nokia renamed Nokolisp to\n\"Nykylisp\" and totally owned it, and now somebody else claims to be the sole\nauthor.\n\nWorking Nokolisp Intepreter/Compiler for Msdos is here.\n\nNokolisp demonstration in Youtube. (*NEW*)\n\nNoko had no knowledge of lambda calculus at the time, but he had rudimentary\ncomprehension of Prolog-like pattern matching and thus the language was\nformally described as follows:\n\n    \n    \n    (defun car ((x . y)) x) (defun cdr ((x . y)) y) (defun list x x) (defun cons (x y) (list x . y))\n\nTimoNoko Github Repository\n\n# Addendum: Early History (*NEW*)\n\nNoko had constructed a Forth-like interpreter inspired by Byte-magazine. Then\nhe realized than if he defined the symbol \"(\" to throw next symbol on to\nseparate stack and \")\" symbol to execute it, he would have much nicer code.\n\nHe got access to time-shared Interlisp with TTY line editor. He now understood\nthe S-expression. He made his own editor, but screen-based, cause he had a\nCRT-terminal.\n\nHe realized that Nova had CAR/CDR built in. The highest bit in 16bit word\ncauses memory controller itself to make new access in 15-bit address space.\n\nEverything was a mess, until 1979 Byte-Magazine came about. Then he understood\neverything and implemented garbage-collector and eval. G\u00f6del-Escher-Bach came\nout 1979 too, insanity was totally the new black!\n\nFirst compiler was in CP/M-version in 1980. CP/M-version had external dynamic\nRAM-memory which was 35 bits wide and 64 kilowords long. Hence one address\ncontained one Lisp-node, with 3 bits for node-type. This device was known as\nS-memory. Some of this stuff was actually documented & published. (Noko T.\nNokoLisp ja Osborne. Tietokone, No. 2-3, 1983)\n\nMsdos-compiler was better, subrus had two addresses, because compiled\nparameters were now in cpu stack.\n\nTN-tools in Nokia were automatically compiled into C-code to be run in VAX-\ncomputers. Compiled C-code did not have garbage collector, there was separate\nreclaim-command for discarding used data. If you managed to run your program\nwithout ever hearing the BEEP caused by garbage collector, your program was\nready for VAXing.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
