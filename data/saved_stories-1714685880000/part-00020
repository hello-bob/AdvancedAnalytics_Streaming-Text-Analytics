You\u2019re building your initial tech stack, and you start \u2013\nwhere else? \u2013 with GitHub.\n\nThe pricing is simple enough. There\u2019s a pretty feature-rich free plan, but\nyou\u2019re willing to pay up because the Team plan includes features for\nrestricting access to particular branches and protecting secrets.\n\nBut the enterprise plan, the plan that costs more than four times as much per\nuser per month \u2013 the plan that seems targeted at, well, enterprises \u2013 promises\n\u201cSecurity, compliance, and flexible deployment.\u201d\n\n> Is security... not for startups?\n\nThe feature comparison bears this out: Only the enterprise plan offers single-\nsign-on (SSO) functionality as part of the package \u2013 a feature that security\nexperts have long agreed is essential. But don\u2019t get mad at GitHub.\n\nDo you want Box? You\u2019ll have to pay twice as much for external two-factor\nauthentication.\n\nDo you want Mailtrap? The team, premium, and business plans won\u2019t do. Only the\nenterprise plan, which costs more than $300 per month more than the team plan,\noffers SSO.\n\nDo you want Hubspot\u2019s marketing product, but with SSO? Prepare to pay $2,800\nmore per month than the next cheapest plan.\n\nAnd these are only a few examples. SSO.tax, a website started by Rob Chahin,\ngathers many more. If you look through, you\u2019ll see companies like SurveyMonkey\nand Webflow even restrict SSO to enterprise plans with a Contact Us option\ninstead of a price.\n\nYou\u2019ll also notice that many of the listings are outdated (the Hubspot listing\nwas last updated in 2018, for example, but we quoted the current price).\n\nMany developers are likely already familiar with the concept of an SSO tax,\nand some are familiar with the broader idea of a security tax. Fewer know why,\ndespite these concepts entering the lexicon, vendors can still get away with\nquietly restricting basic security and sign-in features to expensive\nenterprise plans.\n\n## Three types of security taxes\n\nVendors have managed to normalize charging exorbitant prices for basic\nsecurity features. Here, we\u2019re not even necessarily talking about often\ncomplex logging or monitoring features \u2013 the mere ability to sign in to the\nsoftware itself is an opportunity to upcharge.\n\nIt\u2019s a blurry line, but it\u2019s worth distinguishing between valuable features\nand value-added features. Unlike other features, which are valuable but part\nof the base product, value-added features add incremental value on top of the\nbase product. So, we expect GitHub to be basically operational on the free\nplan but look to other plans to see whether we want to add, say, a wiki\nfeature.\n\nSecurity taxes are baseline features pretending to be value-added features,\nand vendors can charge them by bundling them with those features. These\nsecurity taxes are often exploitative because companies have to pay for more\nfeatures than they need just to get a security feature that should have been\nin the base product.\n\nA baseline feature is turned into a revenue-generation tool often far out of\nstep with its actual maintenance costs. \u201cIf your SSO support is a 10% price\nhike,\u201d Chahin writes, \u201cyou\u2019re not on this list. But these percentage increases\nare not maintenance costs, they\u2019re revenue generation because you know your\ncustomers have no good options.\u201d\n\nResearch from Grip, an identity risk management company, shows how the lack of\ngood options plays out. Grip\u2019s research shows that 80% of the SaaS\napplications employees use are not in their companies\u2019 SSO portals. In their\ninterviews with CISOs, SSO licensing costs \u2013 i.e., the SSO tax \u2013 were the top\nreason.\n\nThe same logic that applies to the SSO tax also applies to two other security\ntaxes: the MFA tax and the user tax.\n\nSecurity experts widely agree that SSO is essential for security, but multi-\nfactor authentication is more basic still, making the act of charging extra\nfor MFA even more egregious. But, as we saw in the intro, companies like Box\ncharge extra for multiple authentication methods.\n\nThe user tax is more subtle. When companies charge excessive amounts per-user\nto secure those users' accounts, users must either choose to pay the security\ntax or engage in the highly insecure practice of sharing credentials among\nseveral individuals. To be clear, many companies charge on a per-user or per-\nseat basis (including Authentik), so you can\u2019t call it a tax until the\nadditional costs really become exorbitant.\n\n## Why the anti-SSO tax movement failed\n\nThe SSO tax has become the most recognized of the three security taxes above.\n\nBy now, there seems to be broad acceptance that the SSO tax is unfair \u2013\nlargely thanks to the SSO Wall of Shame \u2013 but there hasn\u2019t been much change\nfrom software vendors.\n\nA grassroots effort like the SSO Wall of Shame would seem effective at public\nembarrassment. Still, even companies that target users who know better, such\nas Docker and developers, or JFrog and security engineers, charge an SSO tax.\n\nFuture efforts against security taxes will have to keep in mind the three\nreasons the SSO tax movement failed if change is ever going to happen.\n\n1\\. The SSO tax is too profitable and too easy to charge\n\nThe most obvious reason is also the strongest. The very thing we\u2019re\ncomplaining about \u2013 vendors charging too much for a feature that isn\u2019t even\nthat expensive to build or maintain \u2013 is exactly why they charge it.\n\nBen Orenstein, co-founder and CEO of remote pair-programming app Tuple, writes\nabout why SSO should be \u201ctable stakes\u201d and why so many other companies\n(including Tuple, before this post) charged it.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a new SaaS founder and you want to maximize your revenue,\u201d he\nwrites, \u201cI recommend you create an enterprise tier, put SSO in it, and charge\n2-5x your normal pricing.\u201d He even explains that because \u201cSSO costs close-to-\nnothing after a little automation, this price increase is all profit.\u201d\n\nThe math is pretty undeniable, proving Chahin\u2019s basic idea: Vendors can add\nSSO to an enterprise tier and charge much more than it costs to maintain it.\n\nPatrick McKenzie, formerly from Stripe, has tweeted about the same logic. \u201cSSO\nis a segmentation lever,\u201d he writes, \u201cand a particularly powerful one because\neverybody in the sophisticated-and-well-monied segment is increasingly forced\nto purchase it.\u201d\n\nBoth McKenzie and Orenstein emphasize customers being \u201cforced\u201d to adopt an SSO\nplan. Many companies are selling into regulated industries, so they\u2019ll likely\nbe forced to upgrade all of their software to whichever plan includes SSO.\n\n2\\. The PR risk is too low, and security taxes are too normalized\n\nOrenstein writes, \u201cPeople will get a little mad at you, but not much, because\njust about everyone does this,\u201d and just about everyone does this links to the\nSSO.tax site. By now, the SSO Wall of Shame is proof the SSO tax exists, not\nso much a viable effort at change.\n\nA big part of the explanation is that the Wall of Shame was primarily one\nperson\u2019s effort, whereas the companies that wanted to keep charging these\ntaxes were larger and much more powerful. The vendors charging the SSO tax had\nthe resources to simply outlast the Wall of Shame.\n\nMany of these vendors also received some benefit of the doubt. SSO generally\ntakes some effort to build and some resources to maintain \u2013 especially custom\nSAML setups \u2013 so vendors have been able to rely on a little plausible\ndeniability.\n\nA few companies have tried to make some attention by removing the SSO tax \u2013\nincluding Tuple and Scalr \u2013 but none have really gone viral for the effort.\n\n3\\. The collective action problem traps individuals\n\nThe previous two reasons the SSO tax movement failed focused on problems at\nthe individual company level, but the greatest reason might be industry-wide.\n\nIf we zoom out, the SSO tax isn\u2019t just a business decision \u2013 it\u2019s a collective\naction problem.\n\nA collective action problem is when individuals in a given situation would\nbenefit from cooperating but, because of other incentives, work against each\nother to the detriment of all. People keep driving cars, for example, due to a\nwide variety of valid individual incentives but traffic, pollution, and\nclimate change eventually hurt the collective \u2013 including the drivers.\n\nAs the software supply chain has evolved, open-source adoption has grown, and\nsoftware companies have become increasingly interconnected, software security\nhas become an issue that affects the entire industry. The SSO tax shows,\nhowever, that a collective action problem hinders taking the steps necessary\nto improve security for everyone.\n\nIn the past, companies considered security in an organization vs. attacker\nmodel, as one entity building a perimeter to defend itself against targeted\nattackers. But in modern security, organizations are so interconnected that\nattackers can leap from organization to organization and move laterally from\nlow-value vulnerabilities to high-value exploits.\n\nWhen attackers hacked Target in 2013, they didn\u2019t go after Target directly;\nthey entered via a third-party vendor Target had hired. And when Log4j became\nheadline news in 2022, it wasn\u2019t because one attacker found one exploit; a\nvast range of companies suddenly realized they were vulnerable because they\nhad all adopted the same open-source component.\n\nThe more interconnected organizations are, the more security becomes a\ncollective action problem that demands companies shift from prioritizing\nprofits via security taxes to pursuing industry-wide security by offering\naccessible security features and reinforcing security best practices.\n\nEd Contreras, Chief Information Security Officer at Frost Bank, said it well\nin an interview with CISO Series: \u201cWith single sign-on, we\u2019re protecting both\nof our companies\u201d and that the SSO tax, as a result, is an \u201catrocity.\u201d\n\n## Compromise is the only way out\n\nFor the reasons above, the movement to remove the SSO tax has seemingly ground\nto a halt. Vendors are still profiting, companies are still paying, and the\nfurther outdated the Wall of Shame becomes, the less anyone feels ashamed.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean progress hasn\u2019t been made. Coining the term \u201cSSO tax\u201d\nnamed the issue and expanding the idea of security taxes has pushed people\ntoward new ways of thinking about security. If pricing plans are to change,\nhowever, we need to acknowledge the strong reasons for charging the SSO tax\nand offer compromises that satisfy all parties.\n\n### Offer cheaper ways to authenticate\n\nSometimes, heated discussions about the SSO tax on Hacker News miss the fact\nthat SSO technology isn\u2019t always easy to build and maintain.\n\nFor example, Klaas Pieter Annema, engineering manager at Sketch, writes, \u201cI\nwas briefly EM for the team maintaining SSO at Sketch. Supporting Google and\nMicrosoft is easy. Supporting whatever wonky homebuilt some large enterprises\nuse is a huge time sync [sic].\u201d\n\nOne compromise is to split these two situations apart. Vendors can offer\nsimple ways to provide SSO for cheap or free but charge for the more complex,\ncustomized ways.\n\nBitrise, for example, offers standard SSO across its Hobby, Starter, and Teams\npricing tiers but only offers custom SAML at its Velocity and Enterprise\ntiers.\n\n### Charge less\n\nEven in the original Wall of Shame, Chahin writes, \u201cWhile I\u2019d like people to\nreally consider it a bare minimum feature for business SaaS, I\u2019m OK with it\ncosting a little extra to cover maintenance costs. If your SSO support is a\n10% price hike, you\u2019re not on this list.\u201d\n\nA compromise is already available: Vendors can charge for the labor to offer\nSSO but not use SSO as a tool for revenue generation. Vendors can charge less\noutright or move SSO to cheaper pricing tiers.\n\nAs it turns out, this shift might benefit vendors in the long run. According\nto research from Gergely Orosz, nearly 90% of companies now consider it a goal\nto reduce vendor spend.\n\nThe SSO tax has become an obvious target. Any vendor charging an SSO tax is\nmore likely to face spending cuts from customers and less likely to get\nconversions from newly price-conscious customers.\n\nOrosz writes, \u201cConsider removing the \u2018SSO tax\u2019 to boost conversions for\nsmaller companies. CTOs at early-stage companies have mentioned they are\nselective when onboarding to SaaSes that charge an SSO tax.\u201d\n\nOrosz also quotes a few anonymized executives, with one CTO saying, \u201cWe're\ntrying to roll out SSO, but many SaaS vendors charge a security tax, so we've\nhad to be selective about which services we upgrade.\u201d\n\n### Unbundle security, support, and value-added features\n\nSecurity and value-added features, as we covered earlier, are very different\nkinds of features. One way vendors disguise the SSO tax is by charging for\nthese features as a bundle; therefore, one way to compromise is to unbundle\nthese features so that vendors can charge for value-added features but not for\nbaseline security features.\n\nOnce vendors unbundle these features, the previous two compromises make more\nsense: they can either charge less or introduce separate, cheaper SSO\nfeatures. Similarly, companies can also distinguish between SSO feature costs\nand SSO support costs.\n\nIn the previous example, when Klaas Pieter Annema, engineering manager at\nSketch, mentioned how SSO frequently became a huge time sink, he also wrote\nthat Sketch \u201cended up with a rotating support role largely to free up time for\nthese customers.\u201d\n\nWhen companies refer to the costs of SSO, this cost is often what they\u2019re\nreferring to \u2013 not the sheer cost of building and maintaining the feature but\nthe ongoing support costs. That points to another potential compromise:\nVendors could charge for an SSO feature with 24/7 support and charge less for\nan SSO feature that leaves maintenance up to the customer.\n\n## Security vendors are caught in the middle, but developers can build a way\nout\n\nThroughout this article, we\u2019ve hardly mentioned a central party: SSO vendors.\nDespite the obvious centrality of SSO vendors and SSO products and tools,\nsecurity vendors have little leverage when it comes to the SSO tax.\n\nWhat we can do, however, is argue for a shift in industry norms: As we\u2019ve\nwritten before, the buy vs. build framework is outdated, and it\u2019s no longer\nobvious that companies should be buying by default.\n\nThe SSO tax persists because it\u2019s easy for vendors to charge, and companies\ndon\u2019t consider other options. As companies consider those options and\nrediscover why identity is fun, the SSO tax will become less and less viable.\n\nTags:\n\n  * security tax\n  * SSO\n  * SSO tax\n  * enterprise\n  * pricing\n  * identity provider\n  * security\n  * authentication\n\n  * Three types of security taxes\n  * Why the anti-SSO tax movement failed\n  * Compromise is the only way out\n\n    * Offer cheaper ways to authenticate\n    * Charge less\n    * Unbundle security, support, and value-added features\n  * Security vendors are caught in the middle, but developers can build a way out\n\nSubscribe to authentik News\n\nDocumentation\n\n  * Documentation\n  * Integrations\n  * Developer Documentation\n  * Installations\n\nMore\n\n  * Jobs\n  * GitHub\n  * Discord\n\nLegal\n\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Privacy policy\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Authentik Security Inc.
