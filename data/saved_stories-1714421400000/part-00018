Despite the\nuncertain job market, specific strategies can help us navigate these\nchallenging times.\n\nOne pivotal approach is to reevaluate and expand your skillset, adopting a\nT-shaped mindset that goes beyond excelling in just one area.\n\nIn the evolving tech landscape, top tech professionals are no longer evaluated\nby their primary skills; secondary skills, frameworks, business domain\nknowledge and soft skills are crucial to becoming a more versatile candidate.\n\nWhat does this mean for you?\n\nBe prepared to commit to continuous learning and adjust to the next emerging\ntrend. You will weather the storm of layoffs and emerge as a sought-after\ncandidate in the competitive tech landscape.\n\nEPAM Spain offers endless opportunities for growth and development, which are\nsupported by and aligned with local leaders and valued by our employees.\n\nIn 2023, 86 percent of employees actively participated in various learning\nactivities. Each EPAMer dedicated an impressive 42 hours to learning, which is\nfar above the benchmark of 20.7 according to the 2023 State of The Industry\nReport by the Association for Talent Development (ATD) and showcases our\ncommitment to cultivating a culture of continuous learning. This is why EPAM\nhas been recognized as the #2 Top Company in Spain on LinkedIn\u2019s 2023 Top\nCompanies List for professional development in Spain.\n\nAre you looking to advance your tech career? Learn how in this interview with\nFaustyna Wachalska, Talent Development Specialist at EPAM Spain.\n\n\u201cContinuous learning is not just a professional development strategy for tech\nindividuals; it is a fundamental requirement for success in the dynamic and\never-changing field of technology.\u201d\n\nFaustyna Wachalska Talent Development Specialist at EPAM Spain\n\nWhat aspects should I focus on in my career? How do EPAMers \u2018level up?\u2019\n\nAt EPAM, we focus on four key learning and development streams: engineering\ndevelopment, leadership development, soft skills and language skills.\n\n1\\. Our core lies in strong technical expertise, so we have a tailored\nengineering development portfolio. It ranges from programs and courses that\nhelp our engineers develop core technical skills (e.g., Cloud, Data, .NET or\nBusiness Analysis) to solutions that help them master more advanced\ntechnologies (Solution Architecture, Quality Architecture, Advanced Technology\nor Technology Consulting, among others).\n\nWe also offer certification preparation in various technologies (AWS, GCP and\nMicrosoft Azure) or agile methodologies (Agile, Scrum) and continuously expand\nour portfolio with new solutions for high-demand technologies. For example, in\n2023, we launched a highly anticipated Artificial Intelligence program.\n\n\u201cMentoring programs boosted my confidence in handling DevOps an test\nautomation tools. Plus, my ability to craft efficient tests has significantly\nimproved.\u201d\n\nUladzislau Trus Software Engineer in Test at EPAM Spain\n\n2\\. At the same time, our engineers can hone their soft skills through a\ndiverse range of courses, which are designed to enhance their overall\nperformance and effectiveness, equip them with the skills needed to\ncommunicate efficiently and build rapport with colleagues and clients,\nnavigate the cross-cultural environment, understand different perspectives and\nexperiences, or support their well-being.\n\n3\\. Regarding leadership development options, we actively support our\nemployees who aspire to take the managerial path or have already embarked on\nthis journey. We provide the necessary skills and tools to help our growing\nleaders so they can lead effectively and confidently. The diversity of formats\nallows our busy professionals to select the most suitable learning paths for\nthem, including opportunities like individual sessions with certified coaches\nto develop personal career goals.\n\n\u201cLeadership training has fine-tuned my skills paving the way for my\nprogression from a Senior Systems Engineer to leading a team of 100 people.\u201d\n\nVolker Kerkhoff Systems Engineering Manager at EPAM Spain\n\n4\\. As EPAM operates globally and across multicultural teams, our in-house\nlanguage learning solutions focus on formal education to help employees\nimprove their language skills and better support business needs and community\ninitiatives. For instance, our EPAMers in the M\u00e1laga office have recently\nadopted a practice of meeting with colleagues to practice Spanish over coffee\nand snacks.\n\nEPAM's Learning and Development initiatives have been globally recognized and\nawarded by prestigious institutions like ATD Best Awards, LinkedIn Talent\nAwards, Brandon Hall Group Awards and the Chief Learning Officer Learning\nElite Award. This validates the quality and excellence of our resources and\nmakes EPAM an attractive place for top talent.\n\nHow to start a learning journey?\n\n\u201cThe key is to make thoughtful choices tailored to your style and objectives.\nFocus on what\u2019s necessary and build your learning plan around a specific\ncareer development plan.\u201d\n\nMaryna Kovalova Project Manager at EPAM Spain\n\nAt EPAM, we put employees into the driver's seat of their learning journey.\n\nAs part of the ecosystem, each employee has access to their career map, where\nour data science model, based on their profile, generates suggestions on\nskills and offers actionable recommendations to develop them.\n\nTools like the Career Development Plan (CDP) create space for employees\u2019 self-\nreflection and goal-setting and recommend learning opportunities to advance\ntheir careers. In this journey, EPAM Line Managers are reliable \u201cco-pilots\u201d\nwho play a significant role in employee development. The managers can offer\ninvaluable guidance thanks to their deep-rooted experience combined with a\nfull understanding of employees\u2019 unique skills, personal goals and learning\nstyles.\n\n\u201cMy transformation from Team Leader to Delivery Manager was fueled by\npersonalized learning resources and strong support from my line managers.\u201d\n\nMaksym Skliar Delivery Manager at EPAM Spain\n\nIn short, my advice would be to begin your learning journey with a clear plan\nin place, aligned with your objectives, skills and learning style. Use the\ninsights and guidance provided by your manager to chart a clear path ahead.\nRemember that the goal of learning is not just to acquire new knowledge or\nskills but apply those in your professional journey. Finally, it\u2019s important\nto ensure that your learning choices align closely with your career\naspirations and roles.\n\nWhat opportunities are available for non-EPAMers?\n\nThere are plenty of opportunities for non-EPAMers, actually, and we very much\nencourage anyone willing to get a taste of our culture and rich learning\nenvironment by exploring the below platforms:\n\n  * We are Community \u2013 An independent platform for real engineering communities where you can connect with fellow EPAM engineers and join EPAM-hosted events by our tech experts.\n  * EPAM Training Platform \u2013 A professional training platform that allows you to find opportunities to shape a learning journey according to your level, needs and goals.\n  * Learn Platform \u2013 The EPAM education marketplace offering a variety of solutions in technology, leadership, language skills, industry domain and others.\n\nIn summary, continuous learning is not just a professional development\nstrategy for tech individuals; it is a fundamental requirement for success in\nthe dynamic and ever-changing field of technology.
