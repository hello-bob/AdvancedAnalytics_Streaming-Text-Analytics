You\u2019ve heard how Emperor Hirohito\nwent on Japanese radio and informed his people of his decision. But have you\never actually heard what Hirohito told his subjects? The Emperor\u2019s surrender\nspeech is one of the most egregious examples of demagoguery that I\u2019ve ever\nread. A pile of preposterous pretty political lies for peace. And while we\nshould all embrace the peace, today we\u2019re going to review the lies.\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve read, most Japanese listeners were barely able to follow\nHirohito\u2019s surrender speech due to the archaic courtly language and poor sound\nquality. But as far as I can ascertain, the Emperor didn\u2019t have a speech\nwriter. This is the way that Japan\u2019s Living God actually spoke about politics.\nWhich, I think you\u2019ll admit, differs in degree but in not kind from the way\nthat politicians around the world continue to speak about politics.\n\nHere\u2019s the full text, with my critique. Emperor Hirohito\u2019s in blockquotes; I\u2019m\nnot.\n\nNow on sale!\n\n> TO OUR GOOD AND LOYAL SUBJECTS,\n>\n> After pondering deeply the general trends of the world and the actual\n> conditions obtaining in our empire today, we have decided to effect a\n> settlement of the present situation by resorting to an extraordinary\n> measure.\n>\n> We have ordered our government to communicate to the governments of the\n> United States, Great Britain, China and the Soviet Union that our empire\n> accepts the provisions of their joint declaration.\n\nThis is the part where Hirohito fails to explicitly say the word \u201csurrender.\u201d\n\n> To strive for the common prosperity and happiness of all nations as well as\n> the security and well-being of our subjects is the solemn obligation which\n> has been handed down by our imperial ancestors and which lies close to our\n> heart.\n\nStarting multiple wars that killed tens of millions of people is how you\n\u201cstrive for the common prosperity and happiness of all nations\u201d?! That\u2019s what\n\u201clies close to your heart\u201d?!\n\nAnd what sign is there is the emperors of Japan ever cared much about their\nown subjects, much less foreigners? They ruled in luxury over an impoverished\npopulation for millennia.\n\n> Indeed, we declared war on America and Britain out of our sincere desire to\n> ensure Japan's self-preservation and the stabilization of East Asia, it\n> being far from our thought either to infringe upon the sovereignty of other\n> nations or to embark upon territorial aggrandizement.\n\nWhat sign was there that Japan\u2019s survival was ever in danger? China was indeed\n\u201cunstable\u201d after the Chinese Revolution, but the bloodbath finally ended in\n1928. Japan invaded Manchuria three years later, plunging China into over\nforty more years of horror.\n\n> But now the war has lasted for nearly four years.\n\nFourteen years, but who\u2019s counting?\n\n> Despite the best that has been done by everyone \u2013 the gallant fighting of\n> the military and naval forces, the diligence and assiduity of our servants\n> of the state, and the devoted service of our one hundred million people \u2013\n> the war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan's advantage, while\n> the general trends of the world have all turned against her interest.\n\nClassic demagoguery. Hyperbolic praise for \u201ceveryone,\u201d followed by laughable\nunderstatement (\u201cnot necessarily to Japan\u2019s advantage\u201d?!) of the catastrophic\nconsequences.\n\n> Moreover, the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb, the power\n> of which to do damage is, indeed, incalculable, taking the toll of many\n> innocent lives. Should we continue to fight, not only would it result in an\n> ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would\n> lead to the total extinction of human civilization.\n\nTranslation: I\u2019m not just doing this to save my own imperial skin. It\u2019s for\nall Japan. Actually, it\u2019s for all humanity.\n\n> Such being the case, how are we to save the millions of our subjects, or to\n> atone ourselves before the hallowed spirits of our imperial ancestors? This\n> is the reason why we have ordered the acceptance of the provisions of the\n> joint declaration of the powers.\n\nIf your motives were so wonderful, what is there to \u201catone\u201d for?\n\n> We cannot but express the deepest sense of regret to our allied nations of\n> East Asia, who have consistently cooperated with the Empire towards the\n> emancipation of East Asia.\n\n\u201cEmancipation of East Asia\u201d via widescale slave labor, mass rape, and mass\nmurder?\n\n> The thought of those officers and men as well as others who have fallen in\n> the fields of battle, those who died at their posts of duty, or those who\n> met with untimely death and all their bereaved families, pains our heart\n> night and day.\n>\n> The welfare of the wounded and the war-sufferers, and of those who have lost\n> their homes and livelihood, are the objects of our profound solicitude.\n\nAmazing that such a soft-hearted fellow could preside over a fourteen-year\nbloodbath in the first place.\n\nYoung Hirohito\n\n> The hardships and sufferings to which our nation is to be subjected\n> hereafter will be certainly great. We are keenly aware of the inmost\n> feelings of all of you, our subjects. However, it is according to the\n> dictates of time and fate that We have resolved to pave the way for a grand\n> peace for all the generations to come by enduring the unendurable and\n> suffering what is insufferable.\n\nA nice illustration of the diction of Social Desirability Bias. When you make\nan controversial choice, pretend it\u2019s not a choice at all, but \u201cthe dictates\nof time and fate.\u201d It\u2019s the political equivalent of \u201cI love you, but we just\ncan\u2019t be together.\u201d\n\n> Having been able to safeguard and maintain the Kokutai, We are always with\n> you, our good and loyal subjects, relying upon your sincerity and integrity.\n\nLoyal? Yes. Good? No. Good subjects wouldn\u2019t have gone along with this\nmurderous nonsense.\n\n> Beware most strictly of any outbursts of emotion which may engender needless\n> complications, or any fraternal contention and strife which may create\n> confusion, lead you astray and cause you to lose the confidence of the\n> world.\n\nIn plain language, \u201cDon\u2019t try to overthrow me. Which totally didn\u2019t almost\nhappen yesterday. The world won\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\n> Let the entire nation continue as one family from generation to generation,\n> ever firm in its faith in the imperishability of its sacred land, and\n> mindful of its heavy burden of responsibility, and of the long road before\n> it.\n\nJapan was never a \u201cfamily.\u201d No country is, but Japan was especially\nunfamilial. Its people lived under unbroken despotic rule for thousands of\nyears. And if that wasn\u2019t enough to convince you, a ruinous fourteen-year war\nof choice should have.\n\n> Unite your total strength, to be devoted to construction for the future.\n> Cultivate the ways of rectitude, foster nobility of spirit, and work with\n> resolution \u2013 so that you may enhance the innate glory of the imperial state\n> and keep pace with the progress of the world.\n\nHirohito\u2019s last phrase turned out to be prophetic. Post-war, Japan didn\u2019t just\n\u201ckeep pace with the progress of the world.\u201d The Japanese economic miracle was\na pacesetter of world progress. But only because the Japanese tossed \u201cthe\ninnate glory of the imperial state\u201d down the memory hole and redirected their\nsuperlative conscientiousness to peaceful industry.\n\nThe real glory of Japan\n\nIf Hirohito\u2019s litany of lies was the only way to end the war, then he\nshouldn\u2019t have even changed a comma. At least he was lying for a good cause.\nMy point is meta: We should be mindful of the ubiquity of absurd political\nlies, and reflect deeply on the cross-cultural power of demagoguery. While\npoliticians can lie for the greater good, the abundance of pretty political\nlies is a strong reason to embrace the maxims, \u201cThat government is best which\ngoverns least\u201d and \u201cGiving money and power to government is like giving\nwhiskey and car keys to teenage boys.\u201d Economics teaches valuable lessons\nabout whether government can improve the world, but political psychology\nteaches us the even more valuable lesson that even if government can improve\nthe world, it habitually does the opposite.\n\n### Subscribe to Bet On It\n\nBy Bryan Caplan \u00b7 Hundreds of paid subscribers\n\nCaplan and Candor\n\n27 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 Restacks\n\n27\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Demagoguery of Emperor Hirohito\n\nbetonit.substack.com\n\n13\n\nShare\n\n13 Comments\n\nMaxim LottMaximum Truth4 hrs agoThe Japanese Prime Minister said basically the\nsame thing, and now you can watch it in perfect English cadence, thanks to AI:\nhttps://youtu.be/VknyDke6Byw?si=h1nJv_gWVof1rzOMMakes a huge difference in how\nrelatable it is.Expand full commentLike (5)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nMichael HermensThe Cossack3 hrs agoThe more I learn about the Japanese\ngovernment during World War II, it is clear that Hirohito did not unilaterally\ncontrol Japan, nor its military or political strategy.
