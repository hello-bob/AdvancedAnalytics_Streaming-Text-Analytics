(AP)\n\nListen\n\n4 min\n\nShare\n\nComment\n\nSave\n\nPrivately owned train company Brightline held a groundbreaking ceremony Monday\nfor a $12 billion high-speed rail project connecting Las Vegas and Southern\nCalifornia.\n\nSecretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg joined company leaders and other\nofficials for the start of construction in Las Vegas.\n\nBrightline West benefits from $3 billion in federal funds from President\nBiden\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Trains could be running as soon as\nearly 2028, in time for the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.\n\nTravelers have a lot to look forward to. Electric trains will depart every 45\nminutes from a Las Vegas station south of the city\u2019s storied Strip and a\nSouthern California station in Rancho Cucamonga, a Los Angeles suburb about 40\nmiles east of downtown.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nTraveling at up to 186 mph \u2014 faster than any other train in the United States\n\u2014 Brightline West trains will make the 218-mile trip in about 2 hours and 10\nminutes.\n\n\u201cAt long last, we\u2019re building the first high-speed rail project in our\nnation\u2019s history,\u201d President Biden said of Brightline West in December. \u201cWe\u2019ve\nbeen talking about this project for decades. Now we\u2019re really getting it\ndone.\u201d\n\nOther high-speed railroads that would carry passengers at 200 mph and faster\nare in the works in California, Texas and the Pacific Northwest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe bottom line here is we changed the trajectory,\u201d Buttigieg said in an\ninterview Monday. More than $30 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law\nhas been awarded to date and more is on the way, he added.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe success of the Brightline West project could influence how future rail\nprojects receive funding.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be easy but I think they have all of the right things in place to\nget this done,\u201d Buttigieg said.\n\nSpeed is Brightline West\u2019s main selling point. Driving between Rancho\nCucamonga and Las Vegas takes at least three hours without traffic, according\nto Google Maps.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be sitting there flying by on Brightline looking at all these brake\nlights on the highway and thinking, \u2018It sucks to be you,\u2019\u201d said Jim Mathews,\nCEO of the Rail Passengers Association, said on Friday. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s\ngoing to be like for all those people trying to get from greater Los Angeles\nto Las Vegas.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBrightline West trains will run along Interstate 15 for nearly their entire\njourney. They will make two intermediate stops in California: one in Hesperia\nand one in Apple Valley.\n\nTravelers coming from Los Angeles will have the option of riding Metrolink,\nSouthern California\u2019s regional rail system, to the Rancho Cucamonga station\nlocated near the junction of Interstates 10 and 15. The trip between downtown\nLos Angeles and Rancho Cucamonga takes at least 50 minutes by car without\ntraffic, or 1 hour and 15 minutes on the train.\n\n\u201cGetting it to a juncture where pretty much everybody who passes into the I-15\ncorridor goes through is a massive benefit from a climate perspective, a\ncongestion perspective, and an economic perspective,\u201d Buttigieg said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nFuture plans include a direct connection for Brightline West to Los Angeles\nUnion Station as part of the separate California High-Speed Rail project.\n\nSpeed won\u2019t be the only reason to ride Brightline West.\n\nBrightline\u2019s Florida operation connecting Miami to Orlando opened in\nSeptember, giving future customers out West an idea of what to expect. Before\nBrightline\u2019s debut, Amtrak held a monopoly on intercity passenger rail travel\nfor decades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStations are spacious with comfortable areas to sit, bars selling craft\ncocktails and a lounge for premium passengers. Onboard, travelers enjoy\nassigned seats and fast WiFi. Attendants come down the aisle serving snacks\nand drinks throughout the trip.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBrightline told investors that it carried a record 258,307 passengers in\nMarch, and that one in three of its trains were nearly full.\n\nBrightline\u2019s strong ridership, though slower than initially promised to\ninvestors, makes a strong case for building fast and frequent trains between\nmajor U.S. cities such as Los Angeles and Las Vegas.\n\nBrightline West estimates that 6 million people will ride its trains during\nthe first full year of operation, according to a federal environmental\nassessment. That number is projected to grow to as many as 9.2 million people\nwithin a decade.\n\nThe company estimates that, without the train, three-quarters of its riders\nwould drive between Southern California and Las Vegas. Another 15 percent\nwould fly, and the balance would not make the trip at all.\n\n### More travel news\n\nHow we travel now: More people are taking booze-free trips \u2014 and airlines and\nhotels are taking note.
