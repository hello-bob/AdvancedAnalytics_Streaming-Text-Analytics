Especially in an environment that\nprioritizes optimizing and maximizing personal productivity, where it seems if\nyou can\u2019t measure (let alone remember) the impact of a book in your life then\nit wasn\u2019t worth reading.\n\nI don\u2019t believe that, but I never quite had the words for expressing why I\ndon\u2019t believe that. Dave\u2019s articulation hit pretty close.\n\nThen a couple days later my wife sent me this quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson:\n\n> I cannot remember the books I've read any more than the meals I have eaten;\n> even so, they have made me.\n\nYES!\n\nDamn, great writers are sO gOOd wITh wORdz, amirite?\n\nEmerson articulates with acute brevity something I couldn\u2019t suss out in my own\nthoughts, let alone put into words. It makes me jealous.\n\nAnyhow, I wanted to write this down to reinforce remembering it.\n\nAnd in a similar vein for the online world: I cannot remember the blog posts\nI\u2019ve read any more than the meals I\u2019ve eaten; even so, they\u2019ve made me.\n\nIt\u2019s a good reminder to be mindful of my content diet \u2014 you are what you eat\nread, even if you don\u2019t always remember it.\n\n## Update 2024-04-12\n\n@halas@mastodon.social shared this story in response, which I really liked:\n\n> At the university I had a professor who had a class with us in the first\n> year and then in the second. At the beginning of the second year\u2019s classes\n> he asked us something from the material of previous year. When met with\n> silence he nodded thoughtfully and said: \u201cEducation is something you have\n> even if you don't remember anything\u201d\n\nI love stories that stick with people like that, e.g. \u201csomething a teacher\ntold me once...\u201d\n\nSome impact is immeasurable.\n\n##### Reply\n\n  * Email\n  * Mastodon\n  * Twitter\n\n", "frontpage": true}
