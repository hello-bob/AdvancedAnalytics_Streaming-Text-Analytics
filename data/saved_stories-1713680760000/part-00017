Instead, the authors essentially claimed that researchers in this area\nhave protested too much. JW offered several arguments that presumably\nsupported their claims, which we rebut here first. Empirically, however, we\nwondered just how \u201crelatively taboo\u201d this topic might be among Americans in\ngeneral. Via Prolific.com, we surveyed 507 representative Americans on this\nissue. Our survey comprised 33 \u201ctaboo topics\u201d (e.g., whether pedophilia is\nharmful), wherein each participant subjectively rated \u201ctabooness\u201d on five-\npoint Likert scales. We found that the potential genetic basis of race / IQ\ngaps was the tabooest item in our survey. In fact, this topic was rated \u201cmore\ntaboo\u201d than were items regarding incest and even pedophilia. Further, the\nrank-ordering of \u201ctabooness\u201d was highly stable across the various demographic\ngroups we looked at in our survey. At least among a (relatively large)\nrepresentative sample of American adults, research on the genetics of race /\nIQ gaps is very strongly taboo. We conclude by discussing how our survey\nresults further dampen JW\u2019s claim that the taboo is real rather than mythical.\n\nDownload citation\n\nDOI: 10.26775/OP.2024.04.15\n\nKeywords intelligence, race and intelligence, genetics, Taboos, Mythical\nTaboos\n\nReviewed by\n\n  * Peter Frost\n  * Sebastian Jensen\n\nReview time 278 days\n\nReview thread\n\nSee supplementary materials\n\nOpenPsych ISSN: 2597-324X Silkeborgvej 53 8800 Viborg Denmark Email:\ncontact@openpsych.net\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2024 OpenPsych - All Rights Reserved\n\n", "frontpage": true}
