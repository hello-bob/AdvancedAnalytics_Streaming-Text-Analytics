Credit: University of Nottingham\n\nScientists have found a way to transform metal waste into a highly efficient\ncatalyst to make hydrogen from water, a discovery that could make hydrogen\nproduction more sustainable.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Nottingham's School of Chemistry\nand Faculty of Engineering has found that the surface of swarf, a byproduct of\nthe metal machining industry, is textured with tiny steps and grooves on a\nnanoscale level. These textures can anchor atoms of platinum or cobalt,\nleading to an efficient electrocatalyst that can split water into hydrogen and\noxygen. The research has been published in the Journal of Material Chemistry\nA.\n\nHydrogen is a clean fuel that can be used to generate heat or power vehicles,\nand the only byproduct of its combustion is water vapor. However, most\nhydrogen production methods rely on fossil fuel feedstock. Electrolysis of\nwater is one of the most promising green pathways for hydrogen production, as\nit only requires water and electricity.\n\nThe industry is facing a challenge with water electrolysis, as this process\nrequires rare and expensive elements like platinum to catalyze the water\nsplitting. With the limited global supply and increasing prices of precious\nmetals, there is an urgent need for alternative electrocatalyst materials to\nproduce hydrogen from water.\n\nDr. Jesum Alves Fernandes, School of Chemistry, University of Nottingham, who\nled the research team, said, \"Industries in the UK alone generate millions of\ntons of metal waste annually. By using a scanning electron microscope, we were\nable to inspect the seemingly smooth surfaces of the stainless steel,\ntitanium, or nickel alloy swarf.\n\n\"To our astonishment, we discovered that the surfaces had grooves and ridges\nthat were only tens of nanometers wide. We realized that this nanotextured\nsurface could present a unique opportunity for the fabrication of\nelectrocatalysts.\"\n\nHydrogen production from water catalyzed by platinum atoms on metal swarf.\nCredit: University of Nottingham\n\nThe researchers used magnetron sputtering to create a platinum atom \"rain\" on\nthe swarf's surface. These platinum atoms then come together into\nnanoparticles that fit snugly into the nanoscale grooves.\n\nDr. Madasamy Thangamuthu, a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of\nNottingham who was responsible for the analysis of the structure and\nelectrocatalytic activity of the new materials, says, \"It is remarkable that\nwe are able to produce hydrogen from water using only a tenth of the amount of\nplatinum loading compared to state-of-the-art commercial catalysts.\n\n\"By spreading just 28 micrograms of the precious metal over 1 cm2 of the\nswarf, we were able to create a laboratory-scale electrolyzer that operates\nwith 100% efficiency and produces 0.5 liters of hydrogen gas per minute just\nfrom a single piece of swarf.\"\n\nThe group is partnering with AqSorption Ltd, a Nottingham-based company\nspecializing in electrolyzer design and fabrication to scale up their\ntechnology. Professor Andrei Khlobystov, School of Chemistry, University of\nNottingham, said, \"The electrocatalysts made from swarf have the potential to\ngreatly impact the economy. Our unique technology developed at Nottingham,\nwhich involves atom-by-atom growth of platinum particles on nanotextured\nsurfaces, has solved two major challenges.\n\n\"Firstly, it enables the production of green hydrogen using the least amount\nof precious metal possible, and secondly, it upcycles metal waste from the\naerospace industry, all in a single process.\"\n\nThe Zero Carbon Cluster has been set in the East Midlands to accelerate the\ndevelopment and deployment of innovation in green industries and advanced\nmanufacturing.\n\nProfessor Tom Rodden, PVC for Research & Knowledge Exchange at the University\nof Nottingham said, \"Developing hydrogen propulsion systems can be a\nsignificant step towards addressing some of the world's most pressing zero-\ncarbon challenges, especially for the transport and manufacturing industries.\nHowever, this strategy's success depends on producing green hydrogen\nsustainably, such as through water splitting via electrolysis, and this, in\nturn, requires advancements in materials design.\"\n\nMore information: From scrap metal to highly efficient electrodes: harnessing\nnanotextured surface of swarf for effective utilisation of Pt and Co for\nhydrogen production, Journal of Material Chemistry A (2024).
