We review studies on\nd\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in epilepsy with reference to recent advances in the understanding of\nd\u00e9j\u00e0 vu from a cognitive and neuropsychological standpoint. We propose a\ndecoupled familiarity hypothesis, whereby d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is produced by an erroneous\nfeeling of familiarity which is not in keeping with current cognitive\nprocessing. Our hypothesis converges on a parahippocampal dysfunction as the\nlocus of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences. However, several other temporal lobe structures\nfeature in reports of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in epilepsy. We suggest that some of the\ninconsistency in the literature derives from a poor classification of the\nvarious types of d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences. We propose d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu/d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu as one way of\nunderstanding d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences more fully. This distinction is based on\ncurrent models of memory function, where d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is caused by erroneous\nfamiliarity and d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu by erroneous recollection. Priorities for future\nresearch and clinical issues are discussed.\n\nGo to:\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is a transitory mental state whereby a novel experience, such as a\nfirst time visit to a new city, feels as if it is familiar. Although the\nscientific literature on d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is limited, much of it comes from the study\nof epilepsy, and it is this literature that we review here. Following a recent\nupsurge of interest in d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu following an influential review [1],\nexperimental paradigms have been developed which produce an analogue of d\u00e9j\u00e0\nvu in the laboratory (e.g., [2\u20134]). In this paper we take the view that d\u00e9j\u00e0\nvu is a memory-based illusion, originating from the erroneous activation of\nthe epistemic feeling of familiarity. As such, we are interested in how d\u00e9j\u00e0\nvu is experienced in epilepsy, how it relates to memory in epilepsy more\ngenerally, and neural accounts of recognition memory in epilepsy. In turn, we\nelucidate what the study of epilepsy can contribute to our understanding of\nthe d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu phenomenon.\n\nThe study of d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) has a long\nhistory, dating back at least to Hughlings-Jackson's 19th century description\nof the \u201cdreamy state [5]\u201d:\n\n> \u201c[W]hat is occupying the attention is what has occupied it before, and\n> indeed has been familiar, but has been for a time forgotten, and now is\n> recovered with a slight sense of satisfaction as if it had been sought for.\n>\n> Hughlings-Jackson (1888, page 202).\u201d\n\nHughlings-Jackson [6] coined the phrase \u201cdreamy states\u201d to describe the\nnebulous mental states that occur as part of simple partial seizures (SPSs),\nreferring to them as \u201cdouble consciousness\u201d and suggesting that \u201cThese are all\nvoluminous mental states and yet of different kinds; no doubt they ought to be\nclassified ....\u201d Hughlings-Jackson did not use the term d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu to describe\nthese peculiar experiences, but it is clear that one aspect of this dreamy\nstate is the feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Hughlings-Jackson emphasises familiarity,\npreempting one of the first scientific attempts to classify the experience,\ntypically defined as \u201c... any subjectively inappropriate impression of\nfamiliarity of a present experience with an undefined past\u201d (Neppe, 1983, page\n3 [7]). Contemporary descriptions of a dreamy state converge on the same\nnotion of a disturbance to consciousness, uneasiness, and dreamy qualities\n(see [8]).\n\nWe review d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in TLE following four different strands within the\nliterature: (1) surveys of the incidence and subjective qualities of the\nphenomenon and comparison with healthy individuals (questionnaires and\nsurveys); (2) links between pathological brain abnormalities and d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\n(structural and metabolic neuroimaging studies); (3) investigations of the\nneuroanatomical bases of d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences (intracortical brain stimulation\nstudies); (4) unusual ictal manifestations of a mnestic quality (single case\nreports).\n\nWe begin, however, by summarising research into the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu phenomenon to\nproduce a concrete account of this nebulous experience. For a full review of\nd\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences in neurology, psychiatry, and healthy participants, see\nO'Connor and Moulin [9]. The current view of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in healthy participants\nis that it is a memory error which exposes the nature of the memory system.\nAccording to models of memory and consciousness, our memory system is guided\nby feedback from experiential states and cognitive cues (experience based\nmetacognition, e.g., [10]). For example, memory retrieval is guided by\nfeelings of fluency and familiarity. A quick assessment of familiarity for\npart of an encoded item, for instance, is a likely signal that some more\ninformation about that item can be sought for [11]. The experience of novelty,\non the other hand, signals the need to encode information in a scene or\nlocation [12].\n\nIn short, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu occurs when the feeling of familiarity is decoupled either\nfrom the actual experience of a stimulus which is unfamiliar (see also Spatt\n[13]) or when familiarity is felt for material for which the prior experience\nis forgotten or unknown. The resulting mismatch is an erroneous feeling of\nfamiliarity for a stimulus which is simultaneously known by the experient to\nbe unfamiliar. This second part, of knowing that the feeling is wrong is\ncritical for the experience\u2014feelings of false familiarity which are unopposed\nby the knowledge that they are false would be termed false positives within a\nrecognition memory paradigm. Such errors are relatively common and are easy to\nproduce in the laboratory, especially when the information is semantically\nrelated to a target episode, where the gist of an original trace is\nincorrectly recognized as old, such as endorsing the word \u201csofa\u201d as old when\nit was the word \u201csettee\u201d that was studied [14]. Likewise, brief subliminal\npresentations of words in recognition tests can increase the likelihood of the\nitem being endorsed as having occurred on a previous study list on the basis\nof familiarity [15]. To reiterate, this does not produce d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, since the\nparticipant is not aware of the \u201cfalse\u201d nature of the familiarity for the\npreviously unpresented items in the recognition memory test.\n\nOther decouplings of epistemic feelings and memory processing can occur. For\ninstance, jamais vu (often described as the inverse of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\u2014a sense of\nunfamiliarity for a familiar stimulus), by our view would arise because\nsomeone has the experience of novelty for a stimulus which they nonetheless\nknow to be familiar. One other similar clash of evaluations between\nconsciousness and memory is the tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) phenomenon; people can\nfeel with some certainty that they know a word but are temporarily unable to\nreproduce it (e.g., [16]). The critical issue with the ToT is that it seems to\nsignal that material is accessible without actually accessing that material\nitself, suggesting a reflective \u201cfeeling\u201d which is part of the retrieval\nprocess from memory, and yet which does not yield the sought-for item itself,\nand is somewhat disconnected from it.\n\nThe nearest laboratory analogue for our account of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in healthy\nparticipants is \u201crecognition without identification\u201d (RWI)\u2014a line of reasoning\nbegan by Brown and Marsh [2]. In their study, participants shallowly processed\npictures of visual scenes and were one week (Experiment 1) and three weeks\n(Experiment 2) later asked to report the likelihood they had visited the\nplaces. They were able to instill a bias in retrieval which the participants\nwere not aware of, and some compared this to d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Picking up on this work,\nCleary and Reyes [17] have produced a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu-like experience in healthy\nparticipants by arranging for them to process materials during an encoding\nphase in such a way that they are able to \u201crecognise\u201d materials but not know\nfrom where they encountered the information. For instance, participants may\nperceive a set of scenes in a study phase and see very similar scenes in a\ntest phase. There is sufficient overlap that the participant feels that they\nhave encountered the scene but cannot pinpoint the source of this feeling.\nInterestingly, there are similar accounts of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu historically. Knight [18]\nexperienced d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu whilst in Tibet and, subsequently, suggested that this was\ndue to the vivid descriptions of Laputa in Swift's Gulliver's Travels, a\nsimilarity which was not apparent or retrieved at the time of the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\nCleary proposes a similarity hypothesis of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu arising due to familiarity\nwith a scene caused by an overlap with a previous experience which is\nundetected by the person experiencing it.\n\nFamiliarity is an entity which is relatively well understood in the brain (for\nreview see [19]). For the memory researcher, familiarity is often encountered\nin reference to recognition memory, where there is a well established\ndichotomy of recollection and familiarity, the dual process view. According to\nthis view, humans can endorse items as \u201cold\u201d on the basis of two separate\nprocesses, recollection and familiarity. Recollection is associated with a\nfeeling of \u201cmental time travel\u201d which arises alongside the retrieval of\nspecifics from the prior encoding experience. This may include contextual\ndetails such as the source of a piece of information but also fragmentary\nimages, feelings, and thoughts. Familiarity, on the other hand, is a mere\nsensation of prior experience, or just \u201cknowing\u201d that something has been\nencountered before, devoid of any such evocative contextual information. A\npredominant view is that familiarity is experienced along a continuum, such\nthat people can evaluate the strength of familiarity, but that recollection is\nan all-or-nothing state [20]. These issues are critical for the neuroscience\nof memory since they pertain to different brain areas\u2014the hippocampus and a\nnetwork of associated brain regions mainly within the medial temporal lobe\n(MTL) is responsible for recollection, and a more isolated perirhinal region\nis responsible for familiarity [21]. Figure 1 displays a simplified graphical\noutline of these brain areas, which we will refer to throughout this paper.\nMuch research is done in this area by using subjective report; participants\nare reliably able to distinguish between familiarity and recollection in their\nrecognition test performance, and this produces reliable differences in neural\nactivation as indexed by fMRI [22].\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFigure 1\n\nCoronal section of the temporal lobe showing key structures.\n\nIt is not surprising therefore that researchers have considered the separate\ncontribution of recollection and familiarity in TLE [23\u201328]. The consensus is\nthat whereas there is impaired recollection in TLE, familiarity is largely\nspared. This means that people with TLE can make effective memory judgments on\nthe basis of an assessment of familiarity, but lack recollection. This is\nmanifested not only in a lack of contextual details in their memories of\npersonal experiences [29] but also on recognition memory tests [27].\n\nBy this view, we might expect an increase in d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in patients with TLE\nwhich is in some way related to their memory deficit according to the\ncognitive account above. This could occur in a chronic form due to the fact\nthat familiarity is intact in TLE, but the retrieval of contextual information\nis impaired. One possibility is that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences in TLE are a clinical\nmanifestation of RWI. This may mean that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in TLE is an earnest error\ndriven by forgetting\u2014scenes may be genuinely familiar to the subject of\nexperience, but they cannot retrieve how they encountered the information\npreviously. Data-driven accounts such as this [30\u201332] view d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as a\nbottom-up process, whereby familiarity is actually a relevant assessment of a\nscene, but the person cannot access why they feel that way (similar things\nhave been produced using hypnosis, e.g., [33]). An alternative hypothesis\npresented by Spatt [13] suggests that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is a result of false activation\nof an isolated parahippocampal based familiarity system; in TLE this occurs\nwhen familiarity is generated erroneously as part of seizure activity, and is\nnot appropriate to the current scene. The main way to differentiate these two\naccounts would be knowing what triggers d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. If it is due to an underlying\nchronic memory problem we would expect to see it outside of seizure activity,\nwhereas if it is a top-down brain-based memory error, we would expect that it\nwas related to seizure activity. The first part of the review considers these\nissues by looking at the incidence and phenomenology of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\n\nGo to:\n\n## 2\\. Incidence and Phenomenology of D\u00e9j\u00e0 Experiences\n\nAnecdotal reports of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu consistently suggest that it is experienced as\npart of SPSs in some TLE patients. Given the frequency of these reports, one\nmight expect then that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is experienced more commonly in TLE than in the\nnormal population. Several researchers have examined the incidence and nature\nof d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences in TLE compared to healthy participants. The key issue is\nwhether there is any diagnostic value to d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences.\n\nA recent large-scale questionnaire study by Adachi et al. [34] addressed this\nquestion. They administered the Inventory of D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu Experiences Assessment\n(IDEA, [35]) scale, which obtains measures of frequency of occurrence and the\nsubjectively perceived psychobehavioural consequences of having d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In\ntheir sample of 312 patients, 143 had TLE; these were matched with a control\ngroup of 402 healthy adults. Intriguingly, they found that significantly fewer\npatients had some form of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu (63.1%), compared with controls (76.1%).\nThis does not tally with the idea stated above that due to temporal lobe\ndysfunction, and resulting deficits in recollection, people with TLE are\ndisposed to a memory-based d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experience.\n\nThis might suggest that there is nothing unique about the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experience\nin epilepsy. Adachi and colleagues were also motivated to investigate whether\nthe subjective experience of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu could be predictive of seizure activity.\nThey asked patients to differentiate between instances where they were aware\nthe d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was part of seizure activity (seizure recognition form\u2014SR) and\nthose when it occurred as a nonepileptic subjective event (nonseizure\nrecognition\u2014NSR). The SR form was experienced by 24% of patients and most\ncommonly in TLE, whereas 55.6% had the NSR form, and 16.3% encountered both.\nIn those patients experiencing both types, it was found that the SR form\ntended to occur more frequently at night, was reported as occurring more\nrecently, and was associated with negative affect and more dissociative\nfeatures; hence there were several phenomenological differences between the\ntwo. However, Adachi et al. [34] found no association between the SR form and\nmesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) but patients with MTS experienced the NSR form\nless frequently than others, that is, they actually, again, had lower levels\nof the \u201chealthy\u201d form of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\n\nThe finding of a lower incidence of any d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in patients therefore provides\nevidence that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is a \u201chealthy\u201d phenomenon, actually occurring less\nfrequently in people with damage to the temporal lobe. This suggests that\nmemory dysfunction per se does not lead to d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experience, as was shown in\na recent group study examining the relationship between verbal memory and\ntypes of SPSs in 42 TLE patients [36]. This also seems reasonable given that\nother forms of memory impairment which stem from temporal lobe atrophy also do\nnot lead to higher levels of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, for example, Alzheimer's disease or even\nhealthy aging [37]. One way of examining this issue aside of imaging reports\nof hippocampal sclerosis would be to examine correlations between memory\nperformance and incidence of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\n\nIt seems likely that TLE patients in particular, however, are more likely to\nreport d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences due to the different and perhaps more striking\nphenomenological characteristics when it is experienced as part of a seizure.\nFuture research should explore this phenomenology further. One possibility\nmight be that it is false feelings of recollection and not familiarity which\nare elevated in epilepsy\u2014we return to this idea below.\n\nAnother questionnaire study compared the qualitative characteristics of d\u00e9j\u00e0\nvu and jamais vu in 15 TLE patients with 115 university students [38]. Similar\nto Adachi et al.'s [34] healthy controls, they found that 75% of students\nexperienced d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and approximately 25% had experienced jamais vu. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\nwas experienced more for places than people in both controls and patients, but\nthere were qualitative differences in the circumstances under which it\noccurred. For example, ictal d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was more likely to occur in familiar\nlocations; for people, it was unrelated to the degree of familiarity of the\nperson; it generally did not evoke feelings of surprise, and it was more\nlikely in a state of mental relaxation. In controls, however, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was more\nlikely to occur for unfamiliar locations and people, cause surprise, and\nhappen more often in a state of mental fatigue. Common characteristics between\nthe two types included the average duration of the phenomenon (in the order of\nseconds) and a feeling of nostalgia. In contrast to Adachi et al. [34], the\nauthors did not find d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences to be associated with negative emotion,\nalthough jamais vu tended to be associated with negative emotions and fear.\n\nOther recent studies have sought to investigate the phenomenological\ncharacteristics of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in TLE through comprehensively assessing patient's\nsubjective reports of their experiences. In their survey, Johanson et al. [39]\nconducted a content analysis of 262 verbal reports of subjective experiences\narising from partial seizures in a sample of 40 patients, of whom 19 had TLE.\nImmediately following an SPS, participants called a telephone number and\nattempted to describe what was felt during the ictal and postictal period. The\nauthors found sensory and bodily sensations occurred most frequently, but\n\u201challucinatory\u201d experiences were also common. In total, 29% of recorded\nseizures consisted of clear visual hallucinations and 18% were classified as\n\u201cmisperceived memories,\u201d including d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, a feeling of \u201cprescience,\u201d and the\nconcomitant retrieval of actual episodic memories. In a different study,\nSadler and Rahey [40] describe how only 3 out of the 218 patients surveyed\nexperienced prescience, or a profound sense of \u201cknowing\u201d what was about to\nhappen next. It seems evident then that there are identifiable memory based\nexperiences distinct from d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, which warrant attention in themselves.\n\nThe \u201cmisperceived memories\u201d in Johanson et al.'s study [39] were common in\npatients with temporal lobe foci, as were feelings of depersonalization and\nbizarreness. As with Adachi et al. [34], they found fear and negative affect\nto be the most common emotions. Sengoku et al. [41] attempted to specifically\nclassify these varying phenomena alongside the emotions experienced in order\nto assess any potential relationship with a tendency to develop psychotic\nsymptoms. They classified the recurrent \u201cdreamy states\u201d of 13 patients as d\u00e9j\u00e0\nvu, jamais vu, or reminiscences and assessed the prevailing emotions\naccompanying each. They found that patients with jamais vu experienced more\nnegative affect and fear and were much more likely to develop psychotic\nsymptoms compared to those with d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and reminiscence, which were primarily\nassociated with positive or neutral affect. We describe case reports of\ndistressing d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences below. In summary, evidence from questionnaire\nstudies is conclusive of a preferential involvement of the temporal lobes in\nthe formation of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, due to its occurrence as part of temporal lobe\nseizures, and its association with emotion, suggesting activity in the\namygdala. However, the bottom-up \u201crecognition without identification\u201d\ninterpretation of the phenomenon in TLE seems not to hold because people with\nTLE do not have d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu more than the healthy population, and can\ndifferentiate between healthy d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and seizure-related d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. O'Connor\nand Moulin [42] examined such \u201cdata-driven\u201d accounts of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in their\ndiscussion of a single case of TLE following encephalitis. They report a man\nwho experienced prolonged periods of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu before complex partial seizures\nduring which he was initially frightened and disturbed. The case described how\nhe tried to reduce the sensation: \u201c[I] went through a period of looking away\nfrom what I was recognizing, hoping that this would get rid of the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. I\nnow know that looking away, or at other things does not help, because the d\u00e9j\u00e0\nvu follows my line of vision and hearing\u201d (page 145). This converges on the\nidea that, rather than d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu being driven by the mismatch of current\nexperience with similar previous perceptual experiences, it is an illusory\nepistemic feeling arising from the alteration of higher order processing as a\nresult of seizure activity.\n\nThe qualitative differences found between d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu originating from seizures\nand in the healthy population reviewed above seem to converge on underlying\nmedial temporal brain pathology, as implied by Adachi et al. [34]. Despite the\nfinding that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is less common in epilepsy than healthy people, it is\nnevertheless more predictable and consistent in patients experiencing the\nphenomenon frequently as part of their SPS. It seems from this that a chronic\nform of familiarity-based memory error is not behind d\u00e9j\u00e0 experience in TLE.\nThe next issue is whether a familiarity-based account holds more generally,\nand to examine this issue we look in more detail at the temporal lobes.\n\nGo to:\n\n## 3\\. Neuroimaging Studies\n\nHypometabolism during fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission\ntomography (^18FDG PET) has previously been shown to be a good indicator of\nthe brain regions involved in the genesis and discharge of ictal events in TLE\n[43]. The first study to utilize this method in assessing the functional\nanatomy of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu used a semiquantitative analysis to compare the metabolic\nactivity in a range of neuroanatomical areas in patients with and without\nseizure-related d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu [44]. Patients were selected from a series of surgical\ncandidates for intractable epilepsy; the sample included 14 patients with\nnonlesional unilateral TLE experiencing d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu habitually alongside SPS, and\n17 patients not experiencing d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu matched for a number of epilepsy-related\nvariables. Upon initial qualitative analysis, the groups' FDG PET images were\nindistinguishable as a similar number of patients in each showed either normal\nuptake, or diffuse hypometabolism of temporal areas in the left and right\nhemispheres. However, using principal component analysis, they derived a\nfactor named the \u201cvisual network,\u201d primarily including mesial temporal\nstructures, the parietal cortex, and other visual association areas where\nsignificant hypometabolism was found predominantly in the left hemisphere of\nd\u00e9j\u00e0 vu patients, regardless of side of seizure onset. Interpreting their\nfindings, the authors suggest that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu may be the result of initial\nactivation in mesial temporal structures, followed by spreading discharge into\nvisual pathways; the activation of such a network helps explain the mnestic\nquality associated with the distorted visual cognition during d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\nexperiences.\n\nMore recently, Guedj et al. [45] conducted a similar FDG PET study, but used\nvoxel-based analysis to identify specific structures within the medial\ntemporal lobes responsible for d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, rather than the regional analysis\ndescribed earlier [44]. This study was theoretically motivated by the proposed\nspecialization of medial temporal structures in familiarity-based recognition\nmemory [46]. The sample included two matched groups of 8 TLE patients,\ndiffering only with respect to the presence or absence of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as a\nsubjective manifestation during seizures. Further, a matched control group of\n20 neurologically intact healthy subjects was used. In selecting participants,\nGuedj et al. [45] excluded patients displaying morphological abnormalities\nevident from brain MRI scans due to past research suggesting these can lead to\ndecreased metabolism [47]. This was in contrast to Adachi et al. [44], in\nwhich a number of patients were found to have atrophy or abnormal signal\nintensity on MRI images. In comparison to healthy subjects, the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu group\ndisplayed significant ipsilateral hypometabolism in parahippocampal regions\n(entorhinal and perirhinal cortices), the superior temporal sulcus, and\nsuperior temporal gyrus. No significant hypometabolism was found in the\nhippocampus in the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu group; in comparison, TLE patients without d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\nonly displayed a significant hypometabolism within the hippocampus compared to\ncontrols. Analyses at the individual level further suggested a higher\nincidence of hypometabolism of the superior temporal gyrus and parahippocampus\nin patients with d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and no difference between groups in the number\nshowing hypometabolism of the hippocampus and amygdala. The results therefore\nsupport the finding of significant hypometabolism in the medial temporal lobe\n(MTL) found in Adachi et al.'s [44] PET study, but do not corroborate their\nsuggestion of the involvement of the parietal cortex. Instead, the superior\ntemporal gyrus was implicated. The authors note that this area receives inputs\nfrom visual and auditory association areas; similar to the explanation\nprovided by Adachi et al. [44] regarding the parietal cortex. The metabolic\nfindings are interpreted by this group as lending support to the thesis that\nthe parahippocampal regions are specifically and independently involved in\nfamiliarity-based recognition, and, hence, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences.\n\nAs the questionnaire surveys demonstrate, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and other SPSs appear to\nmanifest alongside emotions of fear and occasionally pleasant feelings of\nnostalgia. As the amygdala is established as a structure pivotal in emotional\nprocessing, Van Paesschen et al. [48] examined whether abnormal amygdalae in\npatients with intractable TLE has any localizing value for SPSs. They recorded\ndescriptions of SPSs from interviews with 50 patients before combining brain\nMRI and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) to obtain amygdala\nrelaxation time mapping (AT^2). SPS manifestations were classified into 15\ntypes. As well as emotions such as fear, these also included d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, which\nwas defined as \u201ca stereotypical feeling of familiarity, recognition, or\nreminiscence that the patient recognized as abnormal\u201d (page 858). Importantly,\nthey excluded patients with evidence of multifocal seizure onset and those\nwith MRI evidence of foreign tissue lesions. They assessed the AT^2\nipsilateral to the seizure focus, and found an equal number of patients with\nnormal and abnormal amygdalae. Patients with an abnormal AT^2 reported a\nhigher median number of SPS to those with normal AT^2 (6 compared to 3) and\nstepwise logistic regression analyses displayed that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, cephalic and\nwarm sensations, gustatory hallucinations, and indescribable strange\nsensations were the best predictors in discriminating between those with\nabnormal AT^2 and those without. Of these, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu emerged as the best\npredictor of abnormal AT^2. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was more common amongst patients with\nright than left-sided AT^2 abnormalities, although overall SPS frequency did\nnot lateralize.\n\nThe authors conclude that in patients with an abnormal AT^2 ipsilateral to the\nseizure focus, a larger number of SPS manifestations are reported. As they\nnote, in order to confirm their conclusion, depth recordings would be\nnecessary to rule out the possibility that the ictal onset was not within the\nhippocampus, where sclerotic tissue was found in 80% of patients. However,\nthey found that the small number of patients with an abnormal AT^2 in the\nabsence of hippocampal sclerosis (HS) presented with a high number of SPS\ntypes, comparable to that of the patients with both abnormal AT^2 and HS.\nFurthermore, the patients with both normal amygdala and hippocampi had a low\nnumber of SPS types, comparable to that of the patient group with normal AT^2\nand unilateral HS.\n\nThe neuroimaging studies reviewed above point to a number of key structures.\nOf the three papers, one points to hypometabolism in parahippocampal regions\nin the absence of any structural abnormality in TLE patients experiencing d\u00e9j\u00e0\nvu [45]; a second metabolic study identified a larger network involving areas\nof the visual cortex and the possibility of hemispheric differences, but these\nauthors did not control for structural damage [44]; the third study using an\nMRI methodology showed a relationship between abnormal amygdala activation and\na range of experiential phenomenon [48]. On the whole, these studies fail to\nidentify a common region responsible for d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences. As such, only Guedj\net al. [45] lend support to the idea of a disturbance in parahippocampal\nfamiliarity mechanisms alone. However, they do pinpoint dysfunctional\nactivation in networks critical for memory function more generally. In the\nnext section, the activation of more specific regions through direct\nstimulation of the brain is explored with the aim of elucidating the\ninvolvement of hippocampal and parahippocampal recognition memory structures\nto d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences.\n\nGo to:\n\n## 4\\. Intracortical Brain Stimulation Studies\n\nHughlings-Jackson's seminal paper described the involvement of the anterior\nMTL (including entorhinal and perirhinal cortices) as the genesis of \u201cdreamy\nstates,\u201d including reminiscences (d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu) and vivid visual hallucinations,\nand characterized these as separate to a number of other SPS manifestations\n[49]. Since then, a number of studies emerged throughout the latter half of\nthe twentieth century that attempted to assess the specific brain regions\ninvolved in d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu-type experiences by using intracortical brain stimulation\nas part of surgical evaluation for resective surgery in TLE. Later, Penfield\nrejected both Jackson's method of classifying the dreamy state and his\nconclusions about its localization in the MTL [50, 51]. Instead, he viewed\nother sensory illusions as akin to d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu (called interpretive illusions),\nand classed vivid recollections of past memories separately as experiential\nhallucinations. Both of these types of experience, he concluded, were\ndependent on activation of the lateral temporal neocortex, in particular the\nsuperior temporal gyrus.\n\nFollowing Penfield's rebuttal of Jackson's earlier evidence, a number of other\nstudies emerged, all finding that stimulation of the MTL was able to provoke\nd\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in patients either directly [52], or from after-discharge spreading\nfrom lateral areas to the amygdala [53, 54]. However, the lateral site of\nadministration in Gloor et al.'s study [53] was the middle temporal gyrus,\nwhich did not support Penfield's earlier finding.\n\nSome years later, Bancaud et al. [55] attempted to resolve this issue with a\nfurther assessment of 16 TLE patients involving the recording of subjective\nseizure manifestations during intracortical stimulation, chemical activation\nand spontaneous ictal events. Following attainment of relevant clinical data\n(surface EEG, semiology, imaging), depth electrode stereotaxic EEG (SEEG) was\nperformed routinely to localize patients' seizures; this included a variety of\nstimulation sites at lateral and medial temporal regions. Their sample was\ndiverse, including patients with a variety of aetiologies, and differing\nabnormalities on brain MRI; however, the authors document the observations of\neach individual patient. This provides a rich account of their findings,\nincluding direct quotations from patients and the anatomical sites being\nstimulated, of which many evoked phenomenological experiences. Despite the\nvariability in subjective reports between and within seizures, the authors\nattempt to categorise the 57 experiences into five different types of dreamy\nstate: memories of complete scenes; vague reminiscences; d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences;\nstrangeness-familiarity; nonclassifiable. Of these, memories, reminiscences,\nand d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences were recorded the most.\n\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences featured the feeling of \u201creliving\u201d the current experience\nprompting the use of the term \u201cd\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu\u201d (already lived) for the first time\nin the scientific literature. We have subsequently developed a theoretical\ndifferentiation between d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu, but it is one which overlaps\nwith Bancaud et al.'s view [55] that d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu is a longer and more intense\nform of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\u2014the difference is neatly captured in the translations of d\u00e9j\u00e0\nvu (already seen) and d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu (already lived). We return to our technical\ndefinition below.\n\nBancaud et al. [55] classified strangeness-familiarity together due to reports\nthat the erroneous familiarity associated with the present environment was\nactually experienced as a bizarre feeling. In terms of \u201cvisual\nhallucinations\u201d, reminiscences and memory flashbacks were distinguished based\non the vividness of detail reported by the patient. Interestingly, despite the\nvisual quality of most dreamy states, rarely did patients report visual\ndisturbance with the current perceptual environment. Instead, the visual\nelement of these subjective experiences was essentially a memory, and Bancaud\net al. [55], like Jackson [49], argue that elaborate visual hallucinations are\ndistinct from the memory experiences in d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and dreamy states.\n\nThere were a number of subjective phenomenon that rarely cooccurred with\ndreamy states, including oro-alimentary automatisms, loss of contact and other\nsensory hallucinations. Neuroanatomically, dreamy states were provoked\nprimarily by stimulation of the anterior hippocampus, followed by the temporal\nneocortex, and to a lesser extent the amygdala. Dreamy states arising from\nspontaneous seizures always involved the amygdala, anterior hippocampus, and\nneocortex. Notably, activity always spread to the amygdala and neocortex\nfollowing stimulation of the anterior portion of the hippocampus. Stimulations\nto the amygdala and hippocampus involving dreamy states almost always spread\nto the neocortex (17/20 times) but stimulation of the temporal neocortex only\nspread to these mesial temporal structures 8/15 times; this difference was\nfound to be nonsignificant, however. Taking into account the frequency with\nwhich each of these structures evoked dreamy states (due to isolated\nstimulation, or site of afterdis charge), the temporal cortex produced the\nmost, followed by the anterior hippocampus, and lastly the amygdala. However,\nthe authors note that when considering the small number of SEEG contacts in\nthe MTL as compared to the temporal cortex, it was easier to generate dreamy\nstates from stimulation to this area. In fact, the findings suggested it was\nabout ten times more likely to evoke dreamy states from the medial temporal\nstructures (anterior hippocampus/amygdala) than temporal neocortical sites.\nLike others, Bancaud et al. [55] also found the superior temporal gyrus an\neffective site in producing dreamy states, supporting Penfield's previous\nobservations [50, 51]. Laterality effects were not found for MT structures or\nthe temporal neocortex.\n\nSummarizing the findings, the authors conclude that for dreamy states to\noccur, the MTL and lateral temporal neocortex must all be involved, at least\nin the spread of activity in the initial 10 s following stimulation.\nAdditionally, ipsilateral MTL stimulation was harder to generate dreamy states\nthan on the nonepileptic contralateral side; a result also demonstrated by\nHalgren et al. [52] thus lending support to the conclusions drawn from\nquestionnaire studies that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is actually part of \u201chealthy\u201d brain\nactivity. In normal event processing, the hippocampus is involved in memory\nconsolidation and retrieval, the lateral temporal neocortex is involved in\nobject perception and identification and has connections to auditory and\nvisual pathways, and the amygdala processes emotion; therefore the\nsimultaneous activity of this network of regions during seizure propagation\ncauses the common manifestations of the dreamy state. These authors were the\nfirst to specifically link the dreamy state to declarative memory systems.\n\nStemming from Bancaud et al.'s [55] findings, Bartolomei et al. [56] aimed to\nassess the role of subhippocampal structures (perirhinal and entorhinal\ncortices) in d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences. They analysed the experiences generated from\n240 stimulations in the rhinal cortices, amygdala and hippocampus in 24\npatients undergoing presurgical evaluation. Overall, the subjective\nmanifestations of stimulations in the rhinal cortices did not differ from\nthose found in mesial temporal areas in this study, and no convincing effect\nof laterality was found. However, the frequency of different subjective\nphenomenon did differ between entorhinal and perirhinal cortices, and between\nrhinal cortices and other limbic structures; in particular, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and other\nmemory phenomena. Stimulation of the entorhinal cortex was found to provoke\nd\u00e9j\u00e0 vu most often, whereas the perirhinal cortex was associated more with\nmemory reminiscences; very few stimulations in the hippocampus and amygdala\nproduced either of these responses. Overall then, Bartolomei et al. [56]\ndisplayed that illusions of familiarity were more likely to arise from\nstimulation of subhippocampal structures; they suggest that the previously\nreported involvement of other MTL structures may have arisen due to the\nlocalized discharge to the rhinal cortices. In support of their findings, they\ndiscuss animal and human studies of human recognition memory that implicate\nthe rhinal cortices in familiarity discrimination.\n\nThese researchers later presented a more in-depth analysis of one particular\npatient who provided well-described experiential phenomenon [57]. Having\nestablished the roles of subhippocampal structures in dreamy states, they were\nmotivated to address the burgeoning issue of how the mnestic content of\nexperiential phenomenon may map onto episodic and semantic memory systems.\nDuring SEEG investigation, this patient only reported experiencing\nexperiential phenomenon following stimulation of contacts located in what they\ntermed \u201cthe perirhinal region.\u201d Functional coupling analysis was used to\ndetermine the network of regions involved, and a strong relationship in the\ntheta range was observed between the anterior hippocampus, perirhinal region\nand visual areas. The subjective manifestation of the first stimulation was\nassociated with the production of an image of a lake and some bushes, which\nthe patient recalled as being a place he frequents. A second higher intensity\nstimulation in the same region resulted in the same pattern of after\ndischarge, and this time the patient experienced a visual image which he later\nconfirmed was his brother's friend. These visual images related to\ndecontextualised memories of people and places he had seen very often;\nessentially semantic memories. The authors suggest that activation of the\nvisual areas, and the perirhinal regions involvement in context free memory\nexplain this.\n\nVignal et al. also attempted to delineate dreamy states with reference to key\nmemory related structures [58]. They investigated 16 patients, looking to\ncompare any differences between provoked and spontaneous experiences. They\nfound that 45% of dreamy states were evoked by amygdala stimulation, 37.5% by\nthe hippocampus, and 17.5% by the parahippocampal gyrus. There was a\npreference for dreamy states to arise from right sided MTL stimulation, and in\nno cases was d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu reported from stimulation of the left MTL. Further,\nthey displayed that both d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu and visual hallucinations only involved an\nafter discharge to other medial temporal structures, and not the middle or\nsuperior temporal gyri as others have previously found [50, 51, 55]. This was\nfound for provoked and spontaneous seizures, and interestingly, after\ndischarge to temporal neocortex was associated with a lack of, or termination\nof dreamy states. Furthermore, in spontaneous seizures not involving the\ndreamy state, after discharge always spread to the whole temporal neocortex.\n\nBased on their findings, Vignal et al. [58] attempt to resolve some of the\npast inconsistencies in the classification of these subjective phenomenon.\nThey note the distinction made by Penfield and Perot [51] between d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu;\ninvolving the altered perception of the present environment, and \u201cexperiential\nhallucinations\u201d; essentially involving a past memory. In contrast, Vignal et\nal. [58] suggest there is a semiological continuity between the two\nexperiences, as they were often reported to coexist during dreamy states.\nCiting the above findings of Bartolomei et al. [56], they propose that\nepileptic discharge restricted to the entorhinal cortex may result in a \u201cpure\u201d\nform of d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu, but as activity is propagated to other hippocampal\nstructures and the amygdala, widespread functional activation of the fronto-\ntemporal autobiographical memory network may result in a more intense visual\nmnestic experience.\n\nOne theme suggested by the stimulation studies of Chauvel and colleagues\n[55\u201358] is that there is a continuum between feelings of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu,\nand recollection of actual scenes. This notion is borne out by Milton et al.\n[59] who describe a patient with a recently identified syndrome of TLE,\ntransient epileptic amnesia (TEA, [60]). Milton et al.'s [59] patient was a\n66-year-old male who presented with an extensive loss of autobiographical\nmemories from his past that remained following AED treatment. He had never\npreviously experienced d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, but following his treatment period reported\napproximately 6-7 episodes that had the characteristics of d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu.\nStrikingly, after these episodes he then reported the spontaneous retrieval of\na number of remote memories that were previously inaccessible during the time\nhe experienced the TEA attacks. These memories were verified by his wife.\nFormal testing revealed that one of the recovered memories was retrieved with\nthe same level of contextual richness, or episodicity, as matched controls.\nFor future research, it would be interesting to look at the occurrence of\nintrusive memories in TLE, since it may be that there is more overlap between\nthe characteristics of d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences and intrusive memories than there is\nfrom forgetfulness. Indeed, our top down hypothesis, whereby d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in\nepilepsy derives from seizure related activity posits that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is\nessentially an uncontrolled and random mental event not unlike \u201cmind pops\u201d or\nintrusive memories in healthy populations.\n\nThe evidence outlined above appears to fit partially with current dual process\ntheories of memory, and the neuroanatomical sites that have been proposed to\nbe responsible for their action; familiarity-based recognition is proposed to\nbe more reliant on anterior subhippocampal areas, where as recollection is\nreliant on the hippocampus and a distributed network of MTL regions [46].\nDisruption to the familiarity system within parahippocampal structures has\nbeen suggested by Spatt [13] as a mechanism of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and this is supported\nby the studies that found entorhinal cortex involvement in the phenomenon.\nHowever, as Bartolomei et al. [61] point out, isolated disruption to one\nlocalized area seems unlikely to be the only cause of such a complex high-\nlevel phenomenon, especially in light of recent evidence displaying memory\nprocessing is reliant on synchronization of multiple MTL structures,\nspecifically in the theta band [62]. They therefore continued with the\nfunctional connectivity approach advocated in their earlier study [56] and\nassessed neural coupling and signal correlations between MT structures during\nSEEG recordings in TLE patients. They found that stimulations inducing d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\nwere associated with neural coupling between the rhinal cortices, hippocampus\nand amygdala, in both theta and beta bands; therefore arguing against Spatt's\nisolated familiarity system hypothesis [13]. Instead, their results favour the\nsuggestion that d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences may lie along a continuum [58]. The d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\nfound to be localized to the rhinal cortices may represent a lower level\ndisruption of familiarity circuits, but as additional MT structures\n(hippocampus, amygdala) are recruited, a more intense d\u00e9j\u00e0 vecu phenomena\noccurs, sometimes with vivid visual distortion and associations with past\nmemories leading to a feeling of having already lived the current experience.\n\nGo to:\n\n## 5\\. D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu and D\u00e9j\u00e0 V\u00e9cu\n\nOur contribution to the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu literature has been to attempt to classify\nd\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences into two forms according to the dual process view of\nrecognition memory (see Table 1). It seems plausible to theorize that just as\nerroneous sensations of familiarity occur to give rise to d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, erroneous\nsensations of remembering or recollecting may occur. This distinction between\nfalse sensations of familiarity and recollection might help further classify\nthe d\u00e9j\u00e0 states, and more broadly speaking the dreamy state in epilepsy.\n\n### Table 1\n\nOverview of recollection and familiarity.\n\nBrain region| Subjective state| Contextual or source information  \n---|---|---  \nRecollection| Hippocampus| \u201cRemembering\u201d| Some  \nFamiliarity| Perihippocampal Regions| Finding familiar or \u201cjust knowing\u201d| None  \n  \nOpen in a separate window\n\nWe will not reproduce our whole argument here (see [63, 64]), but essentially\nwe suggest that the d\u00e9j\u00e0 phenomenon can be separated into familiarity (d\u00e9j\u00e0\nvu) and recollection (d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu) errors. (For descriptions of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu- and\nd\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu-like experiences induced in healthy participants see [33, 65].) To\nthe best of our knowledge, the term d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu was first used scientifically by\nBancaud and colleagues [55], as noted above, although no clear justification\nof the term is provided (and ultimately Bancaud et al. [55] grouped together\nd\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu experiences). Funkhouser [65] attempted a fractionation\nof d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences into three kinds, one of which was d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu. Notably, to\nillustrate this experience he uses an oft-cited passage (cf., Hughlings\nJackson, above [5]) from Dickens' David Copperfield (our emphasis):\n\n> \u201cWe have all some experience of a feeling, that comes over us occasionally,\n> of what we are saying and doing having been said and done before, in a\n> remote time\u2014of our having been surrounded, dim ages ago, by the same faces,\n> objects, and circumstances\u2014of our knowing perfectly what will be said next,\n> as if we suddenly remember it!\n>\n> Dickens ([66] page 236, as cited by [65]).\u201d\n\nThis fictional account contains contextual details, associated feelings and\nthoughts. As such, it parallels recollection, where in remembering an event we\nare able to draw up contextual information, and the specifics of a prior\nexperience [67]. Thus far, our empirical support for the existence of a\nrecollective process at play in d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu comes from cases of recollective\nconfabulation\u2014dementia patients described as having \u201cpersistent d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\u201d who\nconfabulate contextual details and false statements referring to previous\nstudy episodes [63, 68]. These are striking errors made more frequently for\nnovel than mundane events and always accompanied by feelings of mental time\ntravel, and reproducing the present as if it is contextual information from\nthe past. With such extreme d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences, it is possible to isolate the\nmemory deficit using experimental tasks [68]. A few other cases have been\nreported with the same classification in their descriptions (e.g., [69]).\n\nAlthough not guided by contemporary memory theory, Funkhouser [65] makes a\ncompelling classification of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu. He describes d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as a\nmore nebulous experience, and differentiates it from d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu thus as being\n\u201cprimarily or even exclusively a mental happening\u201d. He suggests that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\nhas no accompanying feeling of prescience, resonating with the idea of mental\ntime travel in d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu.\n\nTo some extent it is difficult given the lack of consensus with regards to\ndefinitions of various d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences, and the reliance on a retrospective\nclassification of subjective reports to know whether distinctions between d\u00e9j\u00e0\nvu and d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu will be clinically useful or even be observed in clinical\ncases. It remains a priority to take this classification, a priori, into cases\nof people with d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences either spontaneously or under stimulation, to\nexamine its utility. Certainly, we suggest that there is some evidence in the\nepilepsy literature that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu are separable experiential\nphenomenon; a distinction identifiable qualitatively in the context of\nspontaneous and provoked epileptic activity. Moreover, the differences in\ntheir phenomenology are attributable to the functionally independent neural\nsubstrates of memory to which their genesis relies upon. If nothing else, we\ncall for a tightening up of the terminology around d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and the recognition\nmemory system. For instance, Spatt's [13] account of a parahippocampal system\nbeing at fault in d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu (which receives support from this review) is summed\nup thus: \u201cThis memory system is responsible for judgments of familiarity. The\nresult is that a momentary perceived scene is given the characteristics of\nfamiliarity that normally accompany a conscious recollection.\u201d [13, page 6].\nThis quote clearly confounds the two processes of familiarity and\nrecollection. A better phrasing might be that the scene is given\ncharacteristics of familiarity without complete retrieval.\n\nIn terms of brain regions, the work here suggests that parahippocampal areas\nare involved in the familiarity felt in d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, but, also that the more\nextensive the network implicated, the more complex and complete the d\u00e9j\u00e0\nexperience is [58]. By this view, we could see that mere familiarity results\nfrom activation of a more restricted network but with extra recruitment or\nafter discharge to connected areas, the more recollection-like the experience\nbecomes, and ultimately, partial retrieval may result in uncontrolled visual\nimagery and emotional content. But this is a view of the neurological picture\nwhich does not receive uniform support. Takeda et al. [70] describe a TLE\npatient with persistent and debilitating d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences, \u201c...Whatever\nhappens to me in daily life, I feel that I have experienced it before. I feel\nlike I'm living again the same life that I have lived before.\u201d (page 196).\nSubsequent imaging revealed hyperperfusion of the left medial temporal area\nduring blood perfusion single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) and\nintegration of MRI data identified the hyperperfused area to be in the left\nentorhinal cortex. The patient's persistent d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was assumed to be a result\nof epileptic activity, and he was subsequently administered 15 mg/day diazepam\nfor three days, which almost completely abolished it. SPECT was carried out\nagain during this period, this time showing no sign of hyperperfusion in the\nmedial temporal area. Takeda et al.'s [70] patient's description of his\nexperience would appear to be consistent with our characterization of d\u00e9j\u00e0\nv\u00e9cu. Critically, however, the imaging evidence suggested localized\ndysfunction in the entorhinal cortex was responsible, which is not in line\nwith our view of the larger hippocampal network involved in more intense and\nelaborate versions of the experience (recollection-based d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu).\n\nTwo other recent case studies found contrasting results. In one, frequent\nepisodes of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu were the result of medial neurocysticercosis localized in\nthe amygdala; following right-sided amygdalectomy sparing the hippocampus, the\npatient's episodes of d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences ceased [71]. In another, a patient with\nTEA experienced what he described as \u201cGroundhog Day,\u201d or the reliving of\nevents, following a particularly severe amnestic attack; MRI investigation\nrevealed high signal intensity in the left hippocampus and a PET scan\ndisplayed dramatic hyperperfusion in the left MTL [72]. It does seem unlikely\nthat such a complex phenomenological experience can be explained by a single\nstructure, and, certainly, the most informative study would come from a\ncomparison of all available investigation methods (SEEG, imaging) on groups of\npatients experiencing different degrees of d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences. Unfortunately,\nhowever, as we have seen, such patients are uncommon and invasive brain\nrecording methods cannot be used ad hoc for research purposes. Again, this\ncalls for a need for a better characterization and description of d\u00e9j\u00e0\nexperiences (which we have attempted in Table 2).\n\n### Table 2\n\nA preliminary classification of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu, and involuntary memories.\n\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu| D\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu| Involuntary memories  \n---|---|---  \nFeelings  \nFamiliarity| \u2022| \u2022| \u2022  \nPrescience| \u2022  \nMental time travel| \u2022| \u2022  \nCharacterisation| \u201cPrior occurrence\u201d| \u201cPrior experience\u201d| \u201cPrior episode\u201d  \nContent  \nEmotion| \u2022| \u2022  \nVisual images| \u2022  \nSource or context| \u2022| \u2022  \nNarrative-like coherence| \u2022  \nA defined past| \u2022  \nRecall| None| Partial| Complete  \nTime course| Shorter| Longer| \u2014  \n  \nOpen in a separate window\n\nNote: we would see that all these experiences should share these same\ncharacteristics; they would all be experienced involuntarily and they will all\nbe relatively brief mental phenomena.\n\nTable 2 presents d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as a relatively simple brief experience. It is an\nillusion merely of prior occurrence. Our definition suggests that it is not a\nrich evocative experience based on the activation of a network of regions, but\nmerely a glitch in the sensation of familiarity which is decoupled from\ncurrent processing, thoughts, and goals. D\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu, on the other hand, is a\nlonger experience where the epistemic feeling is one of mental time travel and\nof partial retrieval of context. In such forms of d\u00e9j\u00e0 experience the person\nmay have time to reflect on the phenomena and search for the source of the\nprior experience, and as they do so, they may have the sensation that the\nexperience is unraveling, or that they actually experienced the present moment\nbefore as a dream or imagining. Prescience, the feeling that they know what is\nabout to happen, will commonly be felt. This feeling of what is about to\nhappen actually resonates with recent views of the hippocampal system as part\nof a remember-imagining system which generates dynamic mental representations\nfrom disperse cortical sites for both past and future events [73]. Most\ncritically, a d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu experience, in comparison to a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experience,\nwill feature emotions (usually negative) and on the whole will feel more\nintense than a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experience.\n\nWe have also tentatively proposed a third category of experience, stemming\nfrom the evidence in this review that d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences appear along a\ncontinuum with memory retrieval. In essence, the chief difference between d\u00e9j\u00e0\nv\u00e9cu and involuntary memory will be that the subject is certain of a defined\nprior episode, that is, their experience maps onto a definite event in their\npast. But there will also be no striking clash of mental\nevaluations\u2014involuntary memories, whilst possibly being intrusive or\ndistressing, do not produce a decoupling of epistemic feelings and content. It\nwill feel like a memory\u2014and it will contain information which allows it to be\nexperienced as such. These involuntary memories may be either true or false\nrecollections, but they will be bound by a sort of coherence in keeping with\nthe reconstructive nature of personal episodic memories [57, 74].\n\nThe classifications in Table 2 have been generated by consideration of the\ndata presented in this review, but also by expectations of the phenomenology\nand purpose of recollection and familiarity. The definition of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu seems\nrather basic and unremarkable, but we suggest that this is the experience\nwhich is closest to healthy d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\u2014a brief mental state which does not\ninvolve the activation of a large neural network. It does resonate with the\nprocess of familiarity too\u2014which is seen as a mere assessment of prior\noccurrence, which if sufficiently strong triggers other processes and a\nconscious memory search. It is likely, that just as familiarity can be thought\nof as a trace strength process, so can d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, with stronger and weaker\nforms. We return to this comparison with the trace strength and dual process\ndebate below. Of course, the value of any such classification system is the\nextent to which it is used and helps us understand data, which is a priority\nfor future research.\n\nGo to:\n\n## 6\\. Clinical Remarks\n\nAs a rule, family doctors, clinical neuropsychologists, and neurologists alike\nwould see epilepsy as the most likely cause of an elevated level of d\u00e9j\u00e0\nexperiences (for an overview of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in neurology, see [75]). Other causes\nof the experience to a pathological degree not discussed here include\nsubstance abuse [76], depersonalization or derealisation [77, 78], or migraine\n[79]. We are aware of cases of debilitating d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu which seem to derive from\nclinical levels of anxiety in cognitively intact people, and this is an area\nof research worthy of further investigation.\n\nFor the most part, the d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences in TLE are unremarkable. However, a\nhandful of recent case reports document the occurrence of more debilitating\nforms of d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences. For example, Cohen et al. [80] report a man with a\nlong history of complex TLE, who after experiencing a concussion following a\nseizure, began to encounter vivid intrusions of traumatic events. However,\ninvestigation of his history and questioning his family revealed that although\naspects of these events did occur, the memories he was recalling were not\nveridical. Moreover, the traumatic and distressing characteristics of these\nfalse intrusions were sufficient for a diagnosis of post traumatic stress\ndisorder (PTSD). According to his wife the intrusion of these memories was\nprecipitated by seizures, suggesting that abnormal medial temporal ictal\nactivity created an integration of different sources of information. We return\nto false memories in TLE below.\n\nMurai and Fukao [81] also report a case where a close relationship was\nobserved between TLE, unusual experiential phenomenon, and psychiatric\nsymptoms. They describe a 23-year-old male TLE patient who experienced d\u00e9j\u00e0\nv\u00e9cu like interictal psychotic episodes. Initially, he only reported\nexperiencing d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu auras, but this had developed into a reduplicative\nparamnesia in which he persistently felt like he was reliving an isolated four\nyear period of his life. This constant cycle of interpreting his current world\nas a replay of past events became so debilitating that the patient had\nattempted suicide on a number of occasions. The authors suggested that his\ninitial d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences were likely to have arisen from mild abnormalities\nin the mesial temporal familiarity circuit, but chronic epileptiform activity\nmay have resulted in neuroplastic regenerative changes involving the\nhippocampus and a distributed memory network responsible for recollection. In\nan attempt to differentiate d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu from hallucinatory memories, we have\nsuggested that involuntary memories contain visual imagery\u2014and it is this that\npossibly allows the experient to feel that they have retrieved a memory,\nrather than having a d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu. D\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu may have a sense of pastness and of\nsome prior context and an expectation of what will happen next, but without\nthe generation of material which can corroborate the experience, in this sense\nrecall of information is partial and inaccessible, such as with the ToT.\n\nIn sum, within epilepsy, if it were possible to better classify d\u00e9j\u00e0\nexperiences, we think that it would give some indication of whether\nfamiliarity or recollective networks were involved in the epileptic activity.\nCertainly, d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu, prescience and emotional states are, we think,\nindicative of a larger network being affected by epileptic changes. The\nclinical examination of consciousness is a contentious one (see [82]), but\npossibly the forms of consciousness represented in familiarity and\nrecollection are somewhat better specified and more extensively researched\nthan others, and offer an opportunity to begin to classify the dreamy state\nfurther. This surely would have clinical repercussions in understanding\nepileptic loci and the impact certain forms of epilepsy have on subjective\nexperience.\n\nGo to:\n\n## 7\\. Conclusions\n\nWe started this paper with the aim of examining the familiarity processes in\nTLE, and how they might be behind the d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences in this group. We took\nas our starting point the contemporary definition of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu which hinges upon\nfamiliarity, and drew upon theoretical mechanisms of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in healthy\ngroups. An examination of the literature suggests that chronic RWI is not\nbehind d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences in TLE. There are several strands to this argument.\nFirst we have observed that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in TLE does not appear to be data driven,\nbut persists whatever stimulus is being attended to [42]. Second, seizure and\nnonseizure-related forms of d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences can be differentiated by TLE\npatients [34]. This suggests that there is seizure-like cause of the\nphenomenon, and a more \u201cnormal\u201d form. Third, we might expect that if a\nrecognition failure is behind d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, then those people who had d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\nshould have poorer memories, which is not generally observed [36]. Finally,\nour own clinical experience is that people with TLE have d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in\nobjectively novel locations and experiences. The RWI account requires only for\na similarity between a previous event and a subsequent experience which goes\nundetected. In very novel situations with little or no overlap with any prior\nexperience, we would not expect d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu to occur, but our own experience is\nthat this is just when d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is most likely to be experienced. That said,\nRWI experiments are relatively straight forward, and it is a research priority\nto examine the neural substrates of such effects in comparison to d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and\nto test groups of TLE people who do and do not experience d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu on RWI\ntasks.\n\nOur alternative account is the decoupled familiarity hypothesis, where\nfamiliarity is experienced in a way that is at odds with the outputs of\ncurrent processing. By our account, in a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experience, familiarity is\nfree-floating and unrelated to the sensed environment, and not triggered by\nthe environment\u2014it is a random top-down brain event. This is an idea which\nreceives some support from parahippocampal hypometabolism findings, structural\ndamage and cortical stimulation in TLE. Spatt [13] produced a similar\nparahippocampal account of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, but his account emphasised the role of the\nfamiliarity system in pattern matching. According to the pattern-matching\naccount, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu arises because a present experience is erroneously matched to\na prior experience. The limitation of this erroneous pattern matching account\nis that it fails to explain the clash in evaluations experienced in d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\nOne aspect of the pattern matching account is that it should also generate\nfalse memories, on the occasions when the false match is very strong. However,\nour impression is that false memory syndromes are rare in TLE, and, although\nthis issue remains ripe for further research, it seems that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is not\nrelated to the generation of false memories and confabulation (but see the\nsingle case reported in [80]).\n\nWe also started this paper with the aim of elucidating the neural mechanisms\nunderlying d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in TLE. We find that there is generally a large number of\nbrain regions responsible for the generation of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in epilepsy. Many\nstudies converge on parahippocampal regions, but as the field advances, larger\nnetworks of regions are being identified [61]. Our view is that there is\nimprecision in the neural regions described as a direct consequence of a lack\nof precision in the definitions of d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences. Along with other authors,\nwe suggest that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu-d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu, and retrieval of fragmentary images and\nemotions probably lie along a continuum. A research priority would be to begin\nto use common definitions and examples across laboratories and participants.\nBecause so much research outside the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu literature differentiates\nexperiences of recollection and familiarity, we suggest that this is a good\nplace to start. We also propose that the field begins to consider d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu-like\nfragmentary images retrieved unintentionally in TLE as involuntary memories\n[83, 84]. Table 2 gives an overview of the differences between these states,\nand could form the beginnings of definitions for use by others. In sum, in\nfinding some support for our decoupled familiarity hypothesis, it makes sense\nfrom a memory theory point of view that decoupled recollection should occur\ntoo\u2014hence our theory of d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu.\n\nOur final concluding remark considers whether d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences in TLE might\nilluminate the processes at work in \u201chealthy\u201d d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. We have previously\ncriticised studies using RWI (e.g., [3]) on the grounds that laboratory memory\nexperiments may be contaminated by social desirability in the levels of d\u00e9j\u00e0\nvu reporting, and that the sensations produced are insipid versions of what\noccurs in daily life [9]. On the other hand, using TLE to understand d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\nhas been criticised on the grounds that healthy d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is unlikely to derive\nfrom seizure-like activity (even though there seem to be definite\nphysiological triggers for d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, such as stress or fatigue [1]). In support\nof the difference between healthy and epileptic d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu are the reports which\nshow people with TLE can differentiate between seizure related and \u201chealthy\u201d\nd\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Like forms of the d\u00e9j\u00e0 experience itself, there may be a continuum of\nexperience between healthy and TLE experiences, and again, the true nature of\nthese experiences may never be elucidated without hypotheses based on\nneuroscientific models and a consensus amongst researchers regarding\ndefinitions. Certainly, the classification of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu we have attempted here\nwill be of use to d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences of any aetiology.\n\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences in epilepsy do reveal something about the working of the\nbrain. Within epilepsy, restricted activation of memory networks used for\nmemory retrieval on a physiological level results in peculiar experiential\nphenomena-restricted (or artificially isolated) activation of the familiarity\nnetwork leads to d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and activation of a wider network, again, restricted\ninsofar as it does not lead to complete retrieval, leads to d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu. Thus,\nd\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences expose the nature of the circuitry and the epistemic feelings\nassociated with retrieval processes. For future work, it would be interesting\nto consider neuromodulation in d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences, since it appears there can be\npharmacological causes which lead to d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu [69, 76]. Similarly, a number of\nauthors have pinpointed specific neuro-oscillations in the theta range as\nbeing critical in the activation of d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences [61, 63].\n\nOn a more theoretical level, the nature of the networks involved in d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\nand d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu echo those supposedly for the separate memory experiences (and\nprocesses) of familiarity and recollection. In fact, there is debate as to\nwhether familiarity and recollection lie along a continuum (e.g., [85, 86]) or\nrepresent two distinct processes (e.g., [87, 88]). The most recent work by\nBartolomei et al. [61] suggests a network account of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, which is similar\nto the idea that familiarity and recollection lie on a unidimensional scale,\nwith their differences being captured in the notion of trace strength.\nAccording to single-process accounts, high-strength memory traces can be\nretrieved with the sensation of recollection (or at least \u201chigh confidence\u201d),\nwhereas a low-strength memory traces elicit mere familiarity with the cue.\nChauvel et al.'s studies seem to address this issue from a direct\nelectrophysiological viewpoint. The \u201ctrace strength\u201d in these experiments\ncould be thought of literally, as the level of current applied to the cortex.\nTheir results suggest that the larger the initial stimulation the more\nextensive the discharge to surrounding regions (e.g., [57, 58]). This leads to\na more nuanced view of whether human recognition memory relies on dual or\nsingle processes\u2014trace strength at one specific point predicts the extent of\nactivation to more dispersed and specialized circuits in concert with the\noriginal stimulated point. Thus, the coactivation and synchronization of brain\nareas seen in after discharges leading to d\u00e9j\u00e0 v\u00e9cu and involuntary memories\nmay represent an account of how a putatively single trace can recruit multiple\nbrain regions and mental representations to produce recollection, which by our\nview, would be anatomically and procedurally separate from the sensation of\nfamiliarity. Artificially induced d\u00e9j\u00e0 experiences in epileptic patients seem\nan ideal test of single-versus dual-process accounts of recognition memory in\nhumans.\n\nGo to:\n\n## References\n\n1\\.
