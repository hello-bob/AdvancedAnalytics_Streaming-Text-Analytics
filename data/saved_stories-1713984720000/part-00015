Designed to be\nmore lightweight and resource-efficient, they\u2019re ideal for applications that\nneed to operate within limited computational environments. With fewer resource\ndemands, SLMs are easier and quicker to deploy, reducing the time and effort\nrequired for maintenance.\n\nThroughout this article, we\u2019ll explore the various use cases of SLMs and\ndiscuss their advantages over LLMs. We\u2019ll focus on: their efficiency, speed,\nrobustness and security. And we\u2019ll aim to understand why this type of AI model\nis becoming a popular choice for applications where large-scale models aren\u2019t\nfeasible.\n\n## Defining Small Language Models (SLMs) and Exploring Their Use Cases\n\nOverall, the SLM is a type of neural network that generates natural language\ncontent. The term \u201csmall\u201d refers not only to the physical size of the model,\nbut also to the number of parameters it contains, its neural architecture, and\nthe scope of the data used for its training.\n\nParameters are numerical values that guide a model\u2019s analysis of input and\ncreation of responses. A smaller number of parameters also means a simpler\nmodel, which requires less training data and consumes fewer computing\nresources.\n\nThe consensus among many researchers is that LMs with fewer than 100 million\nparameters are considered small, although the definition can vary. Some\nexperts consider models with as few as one million to 10 million parameters to\nbe small, in contrast to today\u2019s larger models which can have hundreds of\nbillions of parameters.\n\nHighlighting the opportunities for SLMs when compared to large language\nmodels.\n\n## Summary of use cases of SLMs\n\nRecent advancements with SLMs are driving their widespread adoption. These\nmodels, with their ability to generate a coherent response to specific\ncontexts, have numerous applications.\n\nOne notable use case is text completion, where SLMs predict and generate text,\nassisting with tasks such as sentence completion and conversational prompts.\nThis technology is also valuable for language translation\u2014bridging linguistic\ngaps in real-time interactions.\n\nIn customer service, SLMs power chatbots and virtual assistants, allowing them\nto conduct natural and engaging conversations. These applications are\nessential for providing end-to-end assistance and handling routine inquiries,\nwhich enhances the customer experience and operational efficiency. In content\ncreation, SLMs generate text for emails, reports and marketing materials. This\nsaves significant time and resources, while maintaining content relevance and\nquality.\n\nSLMs also analyse data, performing sentiment analysis to gauge public opinion\nand customer feedback. They aid in identifying named entities for better\ninformation organization and analyse market trends to optimize sales and\nmarketing strategies. These capabilities enable businesses to make informed\ndecisions, tailor customer interactions and innovate effectively in product\ndevelopment.\n\n## The Issues with LLMs\n\nThe reason why training an LLM is often more feasible for large organizations\nis due to three significant challenges: data, hardware and legal concerns.\n\n### Resource and energy use\n\nFirst of all, it\u2019s no secret that training LLMs is an intensive process that\nneeds powerful machines. For example, training Google\u2019s PaLM required a\nstaggering 6,144 TPU v4 chips, while Meta AI\u2019s OPT model, although\ncomparatively more efficient, still used 992 Nvidia A100 GPUs of 80GB each.\nThe scale of this hardware deployment often leads to failures, necessitating\nmanual restarts throughout the lengthy training process. That not only makes\nit more complicated, but also adds to the cost of developing the software.\nSome rough estimates suggest figures as high as $23 million for training a\nsingle model.\n\nThe energy consumption involved in training these models is equally immense.\nAlthough specific details about the training process of GPT-4 remain\nundisclosed, we can refer to the energy consumption for GPT-3, which was\nnearly 1,300 MWh. That\u2019s the equivalent of streaming Netflix for a staggering\n1.6 million hours (using around 0.0008 MWh per hour).\n\nSuch figures highlight the vast disparity in energy use between daily\nactivities and training advanced AI models. Although subsequent processes like\ninference consume considerably less energy, the initial training phase is\nparticularly power-hungry and carbon-intensive.\n\nAdditionally, environmental impacts extend beyond power usage. Recent\nestimates highlight that the carbon footprint associated with training these\nmodels is akin to the electricity consumption of a US family over 120 years.\nWhile companies like Meta have taken steps to reduce this footprint, it\nremains a significant environmental concern.\n\nMany details about the specific resource and energy requirements of LLMs still\nremain under wraps due to competitive secrecy among leading tech companies.\nThis lack of transparency from major AI developers further complicates efforts\nto assess and address these impacts.\n\n### Copyright and Licensing\n\nAccess to vast datasets is another significant barrier for many businesses\nother than the tech giants like Google and Facebook, who dominate this field.\nThis makes it difficult for smaller entities to compete. Many datasets,\nespecially those scraped from the internet, contain copyrighted material,\nwhich raises ethical and legal concerns about the use of such data without\nproper authorization. For example, creators from various fields argue that\ntheir copyrighted works are being used to train AI without permission or\ncompensation.\n\nThe conversation around copyright has evolved as AI technology has advanced,\nand some companies have sought exemptions from copyright laws in order to\ncontinue their operations. However, there is still a risk of litigation, as\nevidenced by discussions about potential lawsuits that could threaten the\nexistence of AI models.\n\nIn contrast, SLMs present a more manageable solution regarding data handling\nand copyright issues. With SLMs, it\u2019s easier to obtain licenses for training\nmaterials, ensuring that content creators are compensated for their work. This\napproach not only reduces legal risks, but also leads to better, more\npredictable model performance through the use of high-quality, ethically\nsourced data.\n\n### Data quality\n\nData quality is a crucial aspect of training LLMs, as it has a direct impact\non the model\u2019s performance. LMs require vast amounts of data that are\nrepresentative of various languages and contexts. However, the available\ndatasets are often unevenly distributed, with a disproportionate amount of\ndata in English and a lack of representation for other languages and cultures.\nThis imbalance can lead to biased models that may not perform well for non-\nEnglish speakers.\n\nThe process of curating and refining this data to ensure it\u2019s of high quality\nis labour-intensive and complex. It involves extensive cleaning and the use of\nadvanced algorithms to weed out irrelevant or low-quality content. The task is\ncrucial because poorly curated datasets can lead to models that are\nineffective or behave unpredictably.\n\nMoreover, the process of acquiring and labeling this data raises ethical\nconcerns. In particular, some of the data used to train LLMs comes from\ncontroversial and potentially damaging internet sources, such as texts\ndescribing extreme violence or abuse. Labeling such content for machine\nlearning purposes raises questions not only about the psychological effect on\ndata labelers, but also about the ethical implications of using these\ndatasets.\n\nThese ethical and quality-related challenges underline the need for better\ndata management practices in the development of LLMs. Ensuring high-quality,\nethically sourced data not only improves the performance of the models but\nalso helps in building AI systems that are socially responsible and less\nharmful. It\u2019s crucial for the AI community to address these issues head-on,\ndeveloping standards that safeguard both the well-being of those in the data\nlabeling process and the integrity of the data used.\n\n## How do SLMs stack up next to LLMs?\n\nSLMs are streamlined counterparts to LLMs, characterized by smaller neural\nnetworks and simpler architectures. Let\u2019s explore this further below:\n\n  1. Resource usage\n\nFirstly, SLMs excel in terms of resource efficiency, which is crucial when\ndeploying AI solutions in environments with limited computational power. Due\nto their smaller number of parameters, SLMs require less memory and processing\npower to train and operate compared to LLMs, making them ideal for use in\nsmaller devices or situations where quick deployment is essential.\n\nThe simplicity of SLMs greatly aids in their development and deployment. Their\nsmaller size and more streamlined neural networks make them easier for\ndevelopers to manage, opening the door for their use in remote or edge\ncomputing scenarios, where maintaining large-scale data processing\ninfrastructure would be impractical. Faster training cycles due to fewer\ntunable parameters further reduce the time from development to deployment,\nenhancing the feasibility of using SLMs in time-sensitive applications.\n\n  2. Speed\n\nWhen it comes to performance speed, SLMs often have the upper hand due to\ntheir compact size. They typically have lower latency and can make faster\npredictions, which is important for applications that need real-time\nprocessing, like interactive voice response systems and real-time language\ntranslation.\n\nAdditionally, SLMs benefit from faster cold-start times, meaning they can\nbegin processing tasks more promptly after initialization compared to LLMs.\nThis feature is particularly beneficial in environments where models need to\nbe frequently restarted or deployed dynamically.\n\n  3. Robustness\n\nDespite their smaller size, SLMs can be surprisingly robust, especially within\ntheir specific domains or tasks. Since they are often designed for particular\napplications, they can handle relevant data variations more effectively than\nLLMs, which might not perform as well when applied outside their primary\ntraining scenarios.\n\nThe manageability of SLMs means they can be more easily monitored and modified\nto ensure they continue to operate reliably, which simplifies ongoing\nmaintenance and enhances overall system stability.\n\n  4. Security\n\nSecurity is another area where SLMs generally excel. With fewer parameters and\na more contained operational scope, SLMs present a smaller attack surface\ncompared to LLMs. This reduced complexity allows fewer opportunities for\nmalicious exploits and simplifies the process of securing the models. By\nfocusing on specific functionalities and smaller datasets, SLMs can achieve a\nhigher level of security hardening, making them suitable for applications\nwhere data privacy and security are paramount.\n\n  5. Other advantages\n\nBeyond resource usage and security, SLMs are often easier to tune due to their\nsimplicity. Adjustments and optimizations can be made more rapidly, which is\nadvantageous in dynamic environments where user needs or data inputs\nfrequently change. This agility also extends to security practices, where the\nability to quickly refine and adapt the models contributes to maintaining\nrobust protection measures.\n\n## SLM Examples\n\nLet\u2019s explore some well-known SLMs:\n\n  * DistilBERT: This model is a simplified version of the original BERT model. It has been designed to maintain around 95% of its predecessor\u2019s capability with language comprehension tasks, such as the GLUE benchmark. With approximately half of the parameters of the BERT base model, DistilBERT offers a good balance between speed, efficiency and cost, making it suitable for use in resource-constrained environments. Although it may be slightly less accurate than larger models, its performance is still commendable considering its reduced size.\n  * GPT-Neo: GPT-Neo is an open-source alternative to GPT-3, with similar architecture and capabilities. It has 2.7 billion parameters and is designed to provide high-quality results for a variety of language tasks without the need for fine-tuning. While GPT-Neo may not always perform as well as larger models, its effectiveness remains strong across a wide range of applications.\n  * GPT-J: Similar to GPT-3 in design, GPT-J has 6 billion parameters and includes Rotary Position Embeddings and attention mechanisms. This model is effective for tasks such as translating from English to French, and it competes closely with the Curie version of GPT-3 (with 6.7 billion parameters). Interestingly, GPT-J outperforms the much larger GPT-3 Davinci model (with 175 billion parameters) in code generation.\n  * Orca 2: Developed by Microsoft, Orca 2 has been fine-tuned with high-quality synthetic data to perform well in zero-shot reasoning tasks. Due to its smaller size, it may face challenges in tasks that require extensive knowledge or contextual depth, but it is specifically designed for high performance in logical reasoning and punches above its weight. .\n  * Phi-2: Another innovative model from Microsoft, Phi-2, stands out with its impressive 2.7 billion parameters. This model is optimized for efficient training and adaptability, making it well-suited for a wide range of reasoning and understanding tasks. Despite its relatively small size, Phi-2 approaches near-human performance in language processing, outperforming much larger models like GPT-4 in terms of training efficiency. One thing to watch out for is that its effectiveness can depend on the representation of data used during the tuning phase.\n\n## Optimization via Intelligent Routing\n\nAlthough SLMs are able to provide decent results at a lower cost, you will\nstill need the power of an LLM or the assistance of another data source. In\nthese situations you should employ a routing layer that redirects the query to\nan optimal source of information.\n\nRouting modules manage and direct user queries within systems that involve\nmultiple data sources and decision-making processes. Essentially, these\nrouters function by receiving a user\u2019s question along with a set of possible\noptions, each tagged with specific metadata, then determining the most\nappropriate choice, or set of choices, in response. These routers are\nversatile and can be employed independently as selector modules, or integrated\nwith other query engines or retrievers to enhance decision-making.\n\nThese modules leverage the capabilities of LMs to analyze and select among\nvaried options. This makes them powerful tools in scenarios like selecting the\noptimal data source from a diverse range, or deciding the best method for\nprocessing information\u2014be it through summarization using a summary index query\nengine, or semantic search with a vector index query engine. They can also\nexperiment with multiple choices simultaneously through multi-routing\ncapabilities, effectively combining results for more comprehensive outputs.\n\nRouting optimizations also include strategic approaches to handling queries,\nto maximize efficiency and reduce operational costs.\n\n  * For simpler and more predictable queries, caching mechanisms can be used to store and quickly access data without repeatedly contacting the LLM provider, thereby reducing response times and costs.\n  * Depending on the complexity of the question, the system may route the query to a different-sized model:\n\n    * Straightforward inquiries may be directed to smaller, less complex models, which can reduce the processing load and operational demands.\n    * More challenging questions can be directed towards more powerful, larger language models that are capable of handling complex queries.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSLMs can offer significant advantages over LLMs for many applications,\nespecially where resource constraints and rapid deployment are crucial\nconcerns.\n\nSLMs not only require less computing power and energy, making them more\nenvironmentally friendly and cost-effective, but also provide faster\nprocessing times and easier scalability across diverse environments.\n\nAdditionally, their custom nature allows for more secure and robust\nimplementations tailored to specific tasks, reducing the risks associated with\nlarge models. While LLMs have their place in handling complex, wide-ranging\ntasks, SLMs offer a compelling alternative that can be just as effective, if\nnot more so, in contexts that demand efficiency, agility and focus. This makes\nSLMs particularly valuable in today\u2019s fast-paced, resource-conscious world,\nwhere the balance of performance and practicality is crucial.\n\n## More articles\n\n### Scaling StableAudio.com Generative Models Globally with NVIDIA Triton &\nSagemaker\n\nApr 10, 2024\n\nLearn from the trials and tribulations of scaling audio diffusion models with\nNVIDIA's Triton Inference Server and AWS Sagemaker.\n\nRead more\n\n### Big Data in LLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n\nMar 22, 2024\n\nExplore how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Language Models by\nutilizing indexing, retrieval, and generation for up-to-date data access.\n\nRead more\n\n\u00a9 Winder Research and Development Ltd. 2013-2024, all rights reserved.\n\nWinder.AI is a trading name for Winder Research and Development Ltd.,\nregistered in the UK under company number 08762077.
