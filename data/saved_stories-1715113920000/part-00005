Microsoft, currently valued at over $3 trillion, did\nnot say how many staff will lose their jobs, but significant layoffs are\ninevitable. IGN has asked Bethesda for comment. Microsoft declined to expand\nfurther when contacted by IGN.\n\nOn Redfall, the disastrous vampire co-op game will now not receive promised\nupdates, including an offline mode and new character DLC, as Microsoft has\nended all development on the game. Microsoft said Redfall will remain online\nto play, and it will provide a \"make-good\" offer for those who bought the Hero\nDLC.\n\nArkane Lyon, which is working on Marvel's Blade, survives the cull, as does\nBethesda Game Studios (Fallout, The Elder Scrolls, Starfield), and Machine\nGames (Indiana Jones and The Great Circle). Doom developer id Software is also\nunaffected.\n\n\"This reprioritization of titles and resources means a few teams will be\nrealigned to others and that some of our colleagues will be leaving us.\n\n\u201c\n\nIn an email to staff sent by Matt Booty, head of Xbox Game Studios, Microsoft\nblamed the cuts on a \u201creprioritization of titles and resources\u201d. The email,\nverified by IGN, is below:\n\n> Today I\u2019m sharing changes we are making to our Bethesda and ZeniMax teams.\n> These changes are grounded in prioritizing high-impact titles and further\n> investing in Bethesda\u2019s portfolio of blockbuster games and beloved worlds\n> which you have nurtured over many decades.\n\n> To double down on these franchises and invest to build new ones requires us\n> to look across the business to identify the opportunities that are best\n> positioned for success. This reprioritization of titles and resources means\n> a few teams will be realigned to others and that some of our colleagues will\n> be leaving us.\n\n> Here are the changes going into effect:\n\n> Arkane Austin \u2013 This studio will close with some members of the team joining\n> other studios to work on projects across Bethesda. Arkane Austin has a\n> history of making impactful and innovative games and it is a pedigree that\n> everyone should be proud of. Redfall\u2019s previous update will be its last as\n> we end all development on the game. The game and its servers will remain\n> online for players to enjoy and we will provide make-good offers to players\n> who purchased the Hero DLC.\n\n> Alpha Dog Studios \u2013 This studio will also close. We appreciate the team\u2019s\n> creativity in bringing Doom to new players. Mighty Doom will be sunset on\n> August 7 and we will be turning off the ability for players to make any\n> purchases in the game.\n\n> Tango Gameworks \u2013 Tango Gameworks will also close. We are thankful for their\n> contributions to Bethesda and players around the world. Hi-Fi Rush will\n> continue to be available to players on the platforms it is today.\n\n> Roundhouse Games \u2013 The team at Roundhouse Games will be joining ZeniMax\n> Online Studios (ZOS). Roundhouse has played a key role in many of our recent\n> game launches and bringing them into ZOS to work on The Elder Scrolls Online\n> will mean we can do even more to grow the world that millions of players\n> call home.\n\n> With this consolidation of our Bethesda studio teams, so that we can invest\n> more deeply in our portfolio of games and new IP, a small number of roles\n> across select Bethesda publishing and corporate teams will also be\n> eliminated.\n\n> Those whose roles will be impacted will be notified today, and we ask that\n> you please treat your departing colleagues with respect and compassion. We\n> will provide our full support to those who are impacted in today\u2019s\n> notifications and through their transitions, including severance benefits\n> informed by local laws.\n\n> These changes are not a reflection of the creativity and skill of the\n> talented individuals at these teams or the risks they took to try new\n> things. I acknowledge that these changes are also disruptive to the various\n> support teams across ZeniMax and Bethesda that bring our games to market. We\n> are making these tough decisions to create capacity to increase investment\n> in other parts of our portfolio and focus on our priority games.\n\n> Bethesda remains one of the key pillars of Xbox with a strong portfolio of\n> amazing games and thriving communities. As we look to the future, there is\n> an impressive line-up of games on the horizon. In 2024 alone we have\n> Starfield Shattered Space, Fallout 76 Skyline Valley, Indiana Jones and The\n> Great Circle, and The Elder Scrolls Online\u2019s Golden Road. As we align our\n> plans and resources to best set ourselves up for success in this complex and\n> changing industry, our teams across Arkane Lyon, Bethesda Game Studios, id\n> Software, MachineGames, ZeniMax Online Studios and the Bethesda publishing\n> and corporate teams will be well-positioned to build new IP, explore new\n> game concepts, and expand on our existing franchises.\n\n> \\- Matt\n\nMicrosoft's announcement of the cuts at Bethesda come over three months after\nthe company announced plans to cut 1,900 staff from its video game workforce,\nand amid a boom time for Bethesda's Fallout series following the breakout hit\nPrime Video TV show. The closure of Tango Gameworks hits just over a year\nafter the launch of Hi-Fi Rush, what many considered to be one of the best\nXbox games in recent years. Tweeting in April 2023, Aaron Greenberg, VP, Xbox\nGames Marketing at Microsoft, addressed concern that Hi-Fi Rush had failed to\nmeet sales targets, calling the game \"a break out hit for us and our players\nin all key measurements and expectations.\" Greenberg continued: \"We couldn\u2019t\nbe happier with what the team at Tango Gameworks delivered with this surprise\nrelease.\" Hi-Fi Rush launched on PS5 as part of Microsoft's new multi-platform\npush in March.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Arkane Lyon chief Dinga Bakaba hit out at the cuts,\ncalling them \"absolutely terrible.\" \"To any executive reading this, friendly\nreminder that video games are an entertainment/cultural industry, and your\nbusiness as a corporation is to take care of your artists/entertainers and\nhelp them create value for you,\" Bakaba continued.\n\n\"Don't throw us into gold fever gambits, don't use us as strawmen for\nmiscalculations/blind spots, don't make our work environments darwinist\njungles. You say we make you proud when we make a good game. Make us proud\nwhen times are tough. We know you can, we seen it before.\n\n\"For now, great teams are sunsetting before our eyes again, and it's a fucking\ngut stab. Lyon is safe, but please be tactful and discerning about all this,\nand respect affected folks' voice and leave it room to be heard, it's their\nstory to tell, their feelings to express.\n\n\"Inside baseball, but if I read 'immersive sim curse' from the community,\nespecially from a fellow dev, I swear to God... Please, let's talk about the\n*real* challenges instead of rehashing irrational anxieties of the past.\n\n\"Even more inside baseball, but with a very, very wide range, as a wise and\nsorely missed man said: 'Please Stop.' \"\n\nLayoffs are sweeping the video game industry, with a number of high-profile\nstudios cutting staff or shutting down. In stark contrast to a year of\nblockbuster video game hits, one of the biggest ongoing industry trends in\n2023 was the prevalence of mass layoffs, and they have continued into 2024.\nWhile actual figures are difficult to obtain, estimates suggest the number of\nworkers laid off in games last year approached or exceeded 10,000. A recent\nGDC survey of developers suggests one-third of all game developers were\nimpacted by layoffs last year, either directly or by witnessing them happen at\ntheir company.\n\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
