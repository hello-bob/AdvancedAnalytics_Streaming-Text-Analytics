Today is also World Password Day, which, albeit\na made-up holiday, usually marks the occasion for tech companies to brag about\nwhat they are doing to move away from requiring or encouraging users to\nremember or jot down in some way unique, strong passwords for each app and\nonline service they use.\n\nTrue to form, Google also marked the occasion by proclaiming that its year-old\npasskey support hit a milestone.\n\n\"Today, we announced that passkeys have been used to authenticate users more\nthan 1 billion times across over 400 million Google Accounts,\" project\nmanagers Sriram Karra and Christiaan Brand said.\n\nWhen Microsoft rolled out Windows Hello and Windows Hello for Business in\n2015, it was detecting about 115 password attacks per second, or so says\nRedmond's Vasu Jakkal, corporate VP for security, compliance, identity and\nmanagement, and Joy Chik, president for identity and network access.\n\nAs of 2023, that number had increased 3,378 percent to more than 4,000 per\nsecond.\n\n\"Password attacks are so popular because they still get results,\" Jakkal and\nChik wrote in a blog post announcing the passkey support.\n\n\"It's painfully clear that passwords are not sufficient for protecting our\nlives online,\" they said. \"No matter how long and complicated you make your\npassword, or how often you change it, it still presents a risk.\"\n\n  * Go ahead, forget that password. Use a passkey instead, says Google\n  * Apple fans deluged with phony password reset requests\n  * Roku makes 2FA mandatory for all after nearly 600K accounts pwned\n  * Dropbox dropped the ball on security, haemorrhaging customer and third-party info\n\nPasskeys are based on a FIDO alliance standard that's supported by Apple,\nMicrosoft and Google. Think of them as password replacements.\n\nThe tech, simply put, works like this: When you create an account for a\nwebsite or app, your device generates a cryptographic public-private key pair.\nThe site or app backend gets a copy of the public key, and your device keeps\nhold of the private key; that private key stays private to your gear. When you\ncome to login, your device and the backend authentication system interact\nusing their digital keys to prove you are who you say you are, and you get to\nlogin. If you don't have the private key or can't prove you have it, you can't\nlogin.\n\nYour device can secure that private key locally using something like a\nbiometric face scan, a PIN, or a fingerprint. Thus if someone wants to break\ninto your account, they'll need your device and that secret PIN or biometric\nscan to unlock the private key (or somehow get a copy of the private key).\nThis is seen as more secure than making people remember or store passwords,\nand ensures a unique key-pair per account. For those wondering about\nmultifactor authentication, it's kinda baked in: Typically a crook will need\nto get hold of your physical device, and your secret or physical part of you\nto access the private key.\n\n\"Because this key pair combination is unique, your passkey will only work on\nthe website or app you created it for, so you can't be tricked into signing in\nto a malicious look-alike website,\" Microsoft explained. \"This is why we say\nthat passkeys are 'phishing-resistant.'\"\n\nUltimately, they aim to simplify security for users by relying on a face or\nfingerprint scan instead of requiring people to remember a unique 47-character\npassword for every damn app and website they access that includes uppercase\nletters, lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, and the name of your\nfirst pet but only if they were a parakeet.\n\n\"The best part about passkeys is that you'll never need to worry about\ncreating, forgetting, or resetting passwords ever again,\" according to Jakkal\nand Chik.\n\nTo be fair, this is probably an overstatement. Criminals are a cunning bunch,\nand they may find ways to break this latest approach \u2014 and we're not talking\nabout cutting off people's fingers or faces.\n\nBut on this World Password Day, here's hoping we can bask in the simplicity\nand security of passkeys for at least another year. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Authentication\n  * Google\n  * Microsoft\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Authentication\n  * Google\n  * Microsoft\n  * Multifactor authentication\n  * Password\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Active Directory\n  * Android\n  * App stores\n  * Azure\n  * Bing\n  * Biometrics\n  * BSoD\n  * Chrome\n  * Chromium\n  * Credential stuffing\n  * Excel\n  * Exchange Server\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * Google Cloud Platform\n  * Google I/O\n  * Google Nest\n  * G Suite\n  * HoloLens\n  * Internet Explorer\n  * Kubernetes\n  * LastPass\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Microsoft 365\n  * Microsoft Build\n  * Microsoft Edge\n  * Microsoft Ignite\n  * Microsoft Office\n  * Microsoft Surface\n  * Microsoft Teams\n  * .NET\n  * Office 365\n  * OS/2\n  * Outlook\n  * Patch Tuesday\n  * Pixel\n  * Pluton\n  * Privacy Sandbox\n  * SharePoint\n  * Skype\n  * SQL Server\n  * Tavis Ormandy\n  * Visual Studio\n  * Visual Studio Code\n  * Windows\n  * Windows 10\n  * Windows 11\n  * Windows 7\n  * Windows 8\n  * Windows Server\n  * Windows Server 2003\n  * Windows Server 2008\n  * Windows Server 2012\n  * Windows Server 2013\n  * Windows Server 2016\n  * Windows Subsystem for Linux\n  * Windows XP\n  * Xbox\n  * Xbox 360\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * 2FA\n  * Alphabet\n  * Bill Gates\n  * Search Engine\n  * Security\n\n#### More about\n\n34 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Authentication\n  * Google\n  * Microsoft\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Authentication\n  * Google\n  * Microsoft\n  * Multifactor authentication\n  * Password\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Active Directory\n  * Android\n  * App stores\n  * Azure\n  * Bing\n  * Biometrics\n  * BSoD\n  * Chrome\n  * Chromium\n  * Credential stuffing\n  * Excel\n  * Exchange Server\n  * Gemini\n  * Google AI\n  * Google Cloud Platform\n  * Google I/O\n  * Google Nest\n  * G Suite\n  * HoloLens\n  * Internet Explorer\n  * Kubernetes\n  * LastPass\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Microsoft 365\n  * Microsoft Build\n  * Microsoft Edge\n  * Microsoft Ignite\n  * Microsoft Office\n  * Microsoft Surface\n  * Microsoft Teams\n  * .NET\n  * Office 365\n  * OS/2\n  * Outlook\n  * Patch Tuesday\n  * Pixel\n  * Pluton\n  * Privacy Sandbox\n  * SharePoint\n  * Skype\n  * SQL Server\n  * Tavis Ormandy\n  * Visual Studio\n  * Visual Studio Code\n  * Windows\n  * Windows 10\n  * Windows 11\n  * Windows 7\n  * Windows 8\n  * Windows Server\n  * Windows Server 2003\n  * Windows Server 2008\n  * Windows Server 2012\n  * Windows Server 2013\n  * Windows Server 2016\n  * Windows Subsystem for Linux\n  * Windows XP\n  * Xbox\n  * Xbox 360\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * 2FA\n  * Alphabet\n  * Bill Gates\n  * Search Engine\n  * Security\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Microsoft's FOMO after seeing Google AI drove investment in OpenAI\n\nHistorical email in antitrust case shows execs 'very, very worried' about\ncapability gaps\n\nAI + ML2 days | 1\n\n#### What's up with Alphabet and Microsoft lately?
