Lessons From Playing God in the Long-Term Evolution\nExperiment\n\nBy Brian Klaas\n\nApril 21, 2024\n\nBrian Klaas\u2019s new book, Fluke: Chance, Chaos, and Why Everything We Do\nMatters, is about the invisible influence of small moments. In this excerpt,\nKlaas takes us into one of the longest-running experiments in history, where\nresearchers play out the lives of twelve identical strains of E. coli across\ntens of thousands of generations to investigate how much or little life can\ndiverge from a single starting place. Klaas explains how a series of small,\ngenetic flukes can drastically change the trajectory of these tiny microbial\nuniverses\u2014prompting us to reconsider how we think about our own history and\nthe weight we place on circumstance. \u2014 Antonia Violante, Books Editor\n\nOur understanding of human history is a battle between contingency and\nconvergence. Do stable, long-term trends drive change? Or does history pivot\non the tiniest details? We\u2019re left to speculate between the two worldviews\nbecause we can\u2019t experimentally test the past.\n\nBut what if you could create multiple worlds? And what if, within them, you\ncould not just control what happens inside but also control time? Imagine the\nability to play God, pressing pause at will, even rewinding and replaying key\nmoments. That would give us a glimpse of the inner mysteries of cause and\neffect with unprecedented precision. We would finally know how change\nhappens\u2014and whether contingency or convergence reigns supreme. It\u2019s an\nintoxicating thought experiment. But could it happen?\n\nA few decades ago, a scientist named Richard Lenski realized it was possible\nwithout science fiction. Lenski, who sports an impressive Darwin-style beard,\nhad been working as an evolutionary biologist, conducting fieldwork in rural\nNorth Carolina to study the predatory southern ground beetle. He began to\nwonder if experiments on evolutionary change could be run, not in the\nuntamable wilderness, but instead in the controlled environment of a\nscientific lab. In 1988, Lenski launched one of the longest-running and most\nimportant experiments in scientific history.\n\nLenski\u2019s experiment is elegant in its simplicity. Take twelve identical\nflasks, populate them with twelve identical strains of E. coli bacteria, feed\nthem the exact same glucose broth, and let them get on evolving. Because E.\ncoli reproduce rapidly, they pass through 6.64 generations per day. The\naverage human generation lasts for 26.9 years, so one day in the world of\nthese bacteria is roughly akin to 178 years of human time. It\u2019s hard to\nbelieve, but since 1988, Lenski has directly observed evolution over 70,000\ngenerations of E. coli, the human equivalent of 1.9 million years of change.\nIn 2004, another remarkable scientist, Zachary Blount, joined Lenski\u2019s lab.\nTogether, they have long overseen twelve microbial universes, each swirling\naround in a flask.\n\nI visited them so I, too, could gaze into these controlled universes. Lenski\nand Blount\u2019s lab at Michigan State University is unremarkable. There are\nbeakers, graduated cylinders, petri dishes, and white bottles of chemicals on\npacked shelves. Next to the door, Lenski points out a boxy incubator, set to\n37\u00b0C, or 98.6\u00b0F, the same temperature as the human body. The incubator is\nhumming as it slowly swirls and shakes a flask of microbes.\n\n> Our understanding of human history is a battle between contingency and\n> convergence. Do stable, long-term trends drive change? Or does history pivot\n> on the tiniest details?\n\nBlount describes the experiment with enthusiasm. Every day, the bacteria in\neach of the flasks grow in an identical broth of glucose, or sugar, and\ncitrate, better known as the \u201cacid that gives orange juice its tang.\u201d The tiny\norganisms swim in citrate, but can only eat glucose. Rather than having sex to\nreproduce, bacteria subdivide into two nearly identical daughter cells.\nVariation in the flasks, therefore, mostly comes from mutations, or little\nmistakes in DNA that occur during copying.\n\nThe genius of the experiment is that from one common ancestor, twelve\ndifferent populations are free to evolve in identical conditions. The\nexperiment has therefore eliminated sex, environmental change, and predators\nfrom the equation, allowing the scientists to observe evolution at its purest.\n\nLenski and Blount can therefore test whether contingency or convergence rules.\nIf change is driven by convergence, then the twelve flasks should only have\nminor variations even over long periods. They might take a dozen different\npaths, but they\u2019ll end up in roughly the same place. But if contingency\ndominates, the twelve populations should eventually diverge in substantial\nways, as chance occurrences create microbial freaks, forever shifting\nevolution\u2019s path.\n\nLenski and Blount also have something that most scientists do not: a time\nmachine. E. coli can be frozen without harming it, allowing freezers to act\nlike a pause button. To press play, just thaw the bacteria back out. From the\nbeginning, Lenski and his team froze all twelve lines of bacteria every 500\ngenerations, which meant they could replay any part of the experiment from any\ngiven snapshot in time. Want to create a bacterial replay starting from the\nday the Soviet Union collapsed or from September 11, 2001? No problem. In\nthose twelve universes of broth, Lenski and Blount control time.\n\nFor more than a decade, the experiment seemed to be backing up the hypothesis\nof evolutionary convergence. The twelve cultures were different, as tiny\nchanges were inevitable. But all twelve seemed to be mostly changing in\nsimilar ways. Each lineage of bacteria was getting incrementally better at\neating glucose, becoming more \u201cfit\u201d in the Darwinian sense. There was a clear\nsense of order. The specific mutations didn\u2019t seem to matter much. It was as\nthough all twelve were following the same railway track, all racing toward the\nsame destination.\n\n> For one line of bacteria, one tiny change meant that everything about their\n> future changed, all because of a random mutation, made possible by four\n> unrelated accidents.\n\nThen, in January 2003, a postdoctoral researcher, Tim Cooper, arrived at the\nlab to tend to the twelve populations, just as he\u2019d done hundreds of times\nbefore. This time, something was different. Eleven populations looked normal,\n\u201clike flasks of water with a drop or two of milk mixed in, only their slight\ncloudiness indicating the millions of resident bacteria.\u201d But the twelfth was\nwildly different. It was partially opaque, a cloudy mixture when it should\nhave been mostly transparent and clear. \u201cI thought it was a mistake,\u201d Cooper\ntold me. \u201cBut I was pretty sure something interesting was going on.\n\nCooper called in Lenski.\n\n\u201cI thought it was lab error,\u201d Lenski told me. \u201cOur motto in the lab to avoid\ncontamination is \u2018when in doubt, throw it out.\u2019\u201d Lenski decided to restart\nthat line of bacteria from the last frozen sample. Thankfully, with their\nmicrobial time machine, mistakes could easily be corrected. A few weeks later,\nthe same flask turned cloudy again. Clearly there had been no mistake.\nSomething was going on.\n\nPerplexed, the scientists sequenced the DNA of the E. coli in that opaque\nflask and found something incredible. The bacteria had evolved the ability to\neat the citrate they were swimming in, which shouldn\u2019t have been possible. In\nthe twentieth century, there was just one documented case of E. coli that was\nable to digest citrate. That it had now occurred by happenstance was already\nan important discovery. But the story was about to get much more interesting.\n\nTo digest citrate, this \u201cfreak\u201d line of bacteria had first undergone at least\nfour unrelated mutations that provided no apparent benefit to the\npopulation\u2014seemingly meaningless errors. But if those four mistakes had not\nall occurred, in that specific order, the fifth mutation, which gave them the\nability to eat citrate, wouldn\u2019t have been possible. Five contingent mutations\nwere stacked on top of each other, and they were utterly improbable, too.\nContingency all the way down.\n\nJust how contingent were they? To find out, Blount spent years studying the\nfreak population. He unthawed samples of the mutant lineage at various points,\nusing the frozen bacterial fossil record to test whether the ability to eat\ncitrate would emerge again. After analyzing roughly 40 trillion cells over\nnearly three years of experiments, he replicated the citrate mutation just\nseventeen times. But if he went back far enough into the bacteria\u2019s\nevolutionary history, the citrate mutation never arose again. It was\ncontingency, through and through.\n\n> To us, the world appears convergent, until we realize, with a jolt, that it\n> isn\u2019t.\n\nTo this day, after 70,000 generations\u2014equivalent to 1.9 million human life\nyears of evolution\u2014only one lineage out of the twelve has developed the\nability to digest citrate. For one line of bacteria, one tiny change meant\nthat everything about their future changed, all because of a random mutation,\nmade possible by four unrelated accidents. The other eleven bacterial\nuniverses are stuck eating glucose, blissfully unaware that they are swimming\nin, as Lenski puts it, a \u201clemony dessert.\u201d\n\nBlount argues that the Long-Term Evolution Experiment provides a sophisticated\nlogic for thinking about critical turning points in human society. Many\nhistorians, for example, say that D-Day was the key to the Allied victory in\nWorld War II. If one could experimentally test that claim, historians would\nfollow the same research design as Lenski and Blount. Imagine you had 1,000\nidentical Earths and could pause them at various points throughout the war.\nThe logic would be that if the Allied victory became far more likely with\nworlds that started after D-Day, the historians could conclude that D-Day was\nthe key turning point. But if the Allies won 75 percent of the time whether\nthe world was thawed in June 1942 or June 1944, then it would be clear that\nthe historians were wrong. D-Day didn\u2019t matter so much. The Allies were always\nlikely to win.\n\nSadly, there\u2019s only one Earth, we can\u2019t rewind time, and these contingency\nversus convergence experiments remain possible only with microbes in a science\nlab. For the moment, though, it seems that Lenski and Blount\u2014and a much larger\nteam of researchers who have worked on the Long-Term Evolution Experiment\u2014have\nresolved the contingency versus convergence debate: to us, the world appears\nconvergent, until we realize, with a jolt, that it isn\u2019t.\n\nToday, the Long-Term Evolution Experiment continues under the direction of\nJeffrey Barrick at the University of Texas Austin.\n\nExcerpted from Fluke: Chance, Chaos, and Why Everything We Do Matters by Brian\nKlaas.
