Even the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, weighed in on the\nsaga, calling the plight of the young whale \u201cheartbreaking\u201d.\n\nBut in the early hours of 26 April, \u201cduring the high tide on a clear and glass\ncalm, star-filled night\u201d, a small group of rescuers watched as she swam under\nthe bridge that had long stood as a barrier to her freedom \u2013 an outcome the\nteam had long held as the best-possible result, given the logistical\nchallenges of capturing and transporting an orca.\n\nIn the hours before she left, federal fisheries officers and members of the\nEhattesaht First Nation fed her chunks of seal meat, gradually luring her\ntowards a bottleneck in the lagoon.\n\n\u201cToday, the community of Zeballos and people everywhere are waking up to some\nincredible news and what can only be described as pride for strength this\nlittle orca has shown,\u201d said a release from \u0294ii\u1e25atis/ \u010d iinax\u1ecbnt chief and\ncouncil.\n\nThe successful escape comes weeks after the young calf outwitted a 50-strong\nrescue team and forced experts to rethink how they might coax the orca out of\nthe area.\n\nHer departure marked a bittersweet ending to a lengthy communal effort to save\nthe calf, after previous efforts to lure her out, including the use of\nvocalisations from family members, banging metal pipes and laying ropes with\nfloats attached, all failed.\n\nThe saga began on 23 March when residents of a coastal community along the\nnorth-western reaches of Vancouver Island spotted the mother, named Spong,\ntrapped in a trough-like depression on the shore. Kwiisa\u1e25i\u0294is circled in the\nshallow waters nearby as her mother struggled, and cries of distress were\nheard from hydrophones placed in the water.\n\nThose calls have been a reminder of the stakes of the rescue, the Ehattesaht\nnation said. \u201cThey are sorrowful and, as they go unanswered, your heart\nsinks.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Down to Earth\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nThe planet's most important stories.

With movement of Bigg\u2019s whales to different pods, experts say the calf\nhas a high likelihood of being accepted by extended family.\n\n\u2018Being so helpless is hard to describe\u2019: can rescuers win the race against\ntime to save an orphaned orca?\n\nRead more\n\nEver since the start of the stranding, the Ehattesaht have emphasized a deeply\nspiritual element to the rescue.\n\nThe origin stories of the Nuu-chah-nulth people tell of a killer whale coming\non to land and transforming into a wolf, which itself transforms into a human.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Canada\n  * Seascape: the state of our oceans\n  * Whales\n  * Americas\n  * Marine life\n  * Wildlife\n  * Cetaceans\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
