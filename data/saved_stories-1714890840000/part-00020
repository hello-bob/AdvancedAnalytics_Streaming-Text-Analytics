You\nstrike upon a research approach: study previous lottery winners! You collect a\nlist of winners, look them up, interview them about how they go about choosing\ntheir numbers, collate this data, identify patterns, and use these to define\nstrategies for picking numbers.\n\nThe problem with this approach is that it doesn\u2019t tell you anything about how\neffective these strategies actually are. To really know how well these\nstrategies work, you\u2019d have to look at the entire population of people who\nemployed them. For example, say that you find that most lottery winners use\ntheir birthdays to generate winning numbers. It may turn out, that for every\nwinning ticket that has the ticket holder\u2019s birthday, there are 20 million\nlosing tickets that also have the ticket holder\u2019s birthday. To understand a\nstrategy\u2019s effectiveness, you can\u2019t just look at the winning outcomes: you\nhave to look at the losing outcomes as well. The technical term for this type\nof analytic error is selecting on the dependent variable.\n\nHere\u2019s another example of this error in reasoning: according to the NHTSA, 32%\nof all traffic crash fatalities in the United States involve drunk drivers.\nThat means that 68% of all traffic crash fatalities involve sober drivers. If\nyou only look at scenarios that involve crash fatalities, it looks like being\nsober is twice as dangerous as being drunk! It\u2019s a case of only looking at the\ndependent variable: crash fatalities. If we were to look at all driving\nscenarios, we\u2019d see that there are a lot more sober drivers than drunk\ndrivers, and that any given sober driver is less likely to get into a crash\nfatality than a given drunk driver. Being sober is safer, even though sober\ndrivers appear more often in fatal accidents than drunk drivers.\n\nNow, imagine an organization that holds a weekly lottery. But it\u2019s a bizarro-\nworld type of lottery: if someone wins, then they receive a bad outcome\ninstead of a good one. And the bad outcome doesn\u2019t just impact the \u201cwinner\u201d\n(although they are impacted the most), it has negative consequences for the\nentire organization. Nobody would willingly participate in such a lottery, but\neveryone in the organization is required to: you can\u2019t opt out. Every week,\nyou have to buy a ticket, and hope the numbers you picked don\u2019t come up.\n\nThe organization wants to avoid these negative outcomes, and so they try to\nidentify patterns in how previous lottery \u201cwinners\u201d picked their numbers, so\nthat they can reduce the likelihood of future lottery wins by warning people\nagainst using these dangerous number-picking strategies.\n\nAt this point, the comparison to how we treat incidents should be obvious. If\nwe only examine people\u2019s actions in the wake of an incident, and not when\nthings go well, then we fall into the trap of selecting on the dependent\nvariable.\n\nThe real-world case is even worse than the lottery case: lotteries really are\nrandom, but that way that people do their work isn\u2019t; rather, it\u2019s adaptive.\nPeople do work in specific ways because they have found that it\u2019s an effective\nway to get stuff done given that the constraints that they are under. The only\nway to really understand why people work the way they do is to understand how\nthose adaptations usually succeed. Unless you\u2019re really looking for it, you\naren\u2019t going to be able to learn how people develop successful adaptations if\nyou only ever examine the adaptations when they fail. Otherwise, you\u2019re just\ndoing the moral equivalent of asking what lottery winners have in common.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n\nLike Loading...\n\nNaming names in incident writeupsMay 22, 2021In \"resilience\"\n\nUber\u2019s adventures in the adaptive universeDecember 16, 2020In \"resilience\"\n\nOn productivity metrics and management consultantsSeptember 3, 2023In\n\"software\"\n\n## Published by Lorin Hochstein\n\nView all posts by Lorin Hochstein\n\nPublished May 4, 2024\n\n### Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\n# Elsewhere on the Internet\n\n  * Website: lorinhochstein.org\n  * Mastodon: @norootcause@hachyderm.io\n  * Twitter: @norootcause\n\n# Recent Posts\n\n  * The perils of outcome-based analysis\n  * The problem with invariants is that they change over time\n  * When there\u2019s no gemba to go to\n  * What if everybody did everything right?\n  * Book Review: Trust in Numbers\n\n# Archives\n\n  * May 2024\n  * March 2024\n  * February 2024\n  * January 2024\n  * December 2023\n  * September 2023\n  * August 2023\n  * June 2023\n  * April 2023\n  * March 2023\n  * February 2023\n  * January 2023\n  * December 2022\n  * November 2022\n  * October 2022\n  * September 2022\n  * August 2022\n  * July 2022\n  * June 2022\n  * May 2022\n  * April 2022\n  * January 2022\n  * December 2021\n  * November 2021\n  * October 2021\n  * September 2021\n  * August 2021\n  * July 2021\n  * June 2021\n  * May 2021\n  * April 2021\n  * February 2021\n  * January 2021\n  * December 2020\n  * September 2020\n  * August 2020\n  * July 2020\n  * June 2020\n  * May 2020\n  * April 2020\n  * March 2020\n  * February 2020\n  * January 2020\n  * November 2019\n  * October 2019\n  * September 2019\n  * August 2019\n  * July 2019\n  * June 2019\n  * May 2019\n  * March 2019\n  * January 2019\n  * December 2018\n  * October 2017\n  * June 2017\n  * May 2017\n  * February 2017\n  * January 2017\n  * July 2016\n  * June 2016\n  * October 2015\n  * August 2015\n  * June 2015\n  * April 2015\n  * February 2015\n  * November 2014\n  * October 2014\n  * September 2014\n  * August 2014\n  * July 2014\n  * June 2014\n  * May 2014\n  * April 2014\n  * March 2014\n  * November 2013\n  * September 2013\n  * August 2013\n  * June 2013\n  * May 2013\n  * March 2013\n  * February 2013\n  * December 2012\n  * November 2012\n  * October 2012\n  * August 2012\n  * July 2012\n  * April 2012\n  * March 2012\n  * February 2012\n  * January 2012\n  * December 2011\n\n# Categories\n\n  * books\n  * cognitive-systems-engineering\n  * education\n  * engineering\n  * incidents\n  * journalism\n  * netflix\n  * openstack\n  * research\n  * resilience\n  * software\n  * systems\n  * Uncategorized\n  * work\n\n# Meta\n\n  * Register\n  * Log in\n  * Entries feed\n  * Comments feed\n  * WordPress.com\n\nBlog at WordPress.com.\n\n  * Comment\n  * Reblog\n  * Subscribe Subscribed\n\n    * Surfing Complexity\n    * Already have a WordPress.com account?
