After his arrest on July\n9, 1994, Williams confessed to 56 bank robberies across the states of\nCalifornia, Texas, and Washington state over an eight-year period, beginning\nin 1986, usually with the help of his wife, Carolyn, usually known as Carol.\nHe kept a meticulous record of his heists, reporting his career total as\n$879,357.^[citation needed]\n\nBy the time of his apprehension, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\nwere not even aware of 8 of his robberies. The FBI, in the course of tracking\nWilliams, had nicknamed him \"The Shootist\" after the film by the same name\nstarring John Wayne because of his habit of firing shots into the air at the\nbeginning of each robbery.^[2]\n\nPerformance art was a large part of Williams' method. His method of firing\ninto the air caused people to avoid eye contact, so authorities had a hard\ntime getting a description of Williams' appearance. The gunshots, in addition\nto cursing and yelling, provoked a sense of terror, ensuring the teller and\ncustomers' compliance.^[4]\n\n> When I ask the manager or commercial teller if they want to be the next to\n> die, and they can smell the acrid smoke of the gunpowder, and sometimes feel\n> the warmth of the gun barrel next to their skin . . . they feel pretty\n> certain that I have just shot a customer, or have at least shot someone in\n> my past.\n>\n> \u2014 Johnny Madison Williams Jr., ^[4]\n\nWilliams put a great amount of forethought into each robbery. He would\nsometimes survey a target for weeks or years, planning out contingencies and\nescape routes. On several occasions, Williams took a shortcut through\nshrubbery and then concealed the passage behind foliage. He was described by a\nspokesman for the San Jose police department as \"by far the most calculating\nand surgical bank robber in the past second half of the 20th century.\"^[2] It\nis unusual for bank robberies to be well thought out, as they are usually\ncrimes of opportunity.^[4]\n\nDuring his eight-year period of robbing banks, Williams and his wife enjoyed\ndomesticity. He took up bowling and hired a pro for private lessons. When\ntraveling, he packed his bowling ball. He won an Amateur Bowlers' Tour\ntournament in the amount of $1,200. He registered for the tournament using his\nreal name, address and phone number. Later, he adopted a phony identity,\nRobert James Hall. He frequently went to Las Vegas \"to launder his loot by\nwagering it on craps tables and sending it into slot machines.\"^[4]\n\n## Prison[edit]\n\nWilliams was sentenced to a prison term of 92 years for the most recent 27\nrobberies; the rest (29) could not be prosecuted due to expired statute of\nlimitations. His wife, Carolyn Marie \"Carol\" Williams, was sentenced to 20\nyears at a federal prison in Northern California.^[5]^[6]\n\nCarolyn Williams (Register Number: 26492-077) was released from prison on\nSeptember 16, 2011, according to the United States Bureau of Prisons website.\n\nJohnny Williams (Register Number: 24434-086) was serving his sentence at\nVictorville Medium II FCI (Victorville, California). His scheduled release\ndate was December 14, 2072, according to the United States Bureau of Prisons\nwebsite.\n\nOn Monday, January 10, 2021, Senior U.S. District Judge Thomas Zilly ordered\nWilliams released after roughly 26 years imprisonment rather than risk his\ncompromised health ^[clarification needed] from exposure to COVID inside\nfederal prisons, including Federal Detention Center-Lompoc (Calif.), to which\nWilliams had been recently transferred.^[7]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ RICCARDI, NICHOLAS (July 12, 1994). \"FBI Celebrates Capture of 'the Shootist': Crime: Bank robbery suspect is notorious for allegedly firing gunshots into ceilings\".
