The legislation has been packaged by its\nproponents as a reform but is, in reality, an attempt to vastly expand the\ngovernment\u2019s spying powers, privacy advocates say.\n\n#### Related Content\n\nThe CIA Is Begging Congress to Please Keep Spying on U.S. Citizens Legal\n\nWatch House Republicans Grill the FBI Over Alleged Domestic Surveillance\nAbuses\n\nWhat Did Tatiana See at the End of 3 Body Problem?\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nview video\n\nWhat Did Tatiana See at the End of 3 Body Problem?\n\nH.R. 7888, or the Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act, would renew\nkey surveillance powers enjoyed by the U.S. intelligence community, broadly\nknown as Section 702.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nThe CIA Is Begging Congress to Please Keep Spying on U.S. Citizens Legal\n\nWatch House Republicans Grill the FBI Over Alleged Domestic Surveillance\nAbuses\n\nWhat Did Tatiana See at the End of 3 Body Problem?\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nWhat Did Tatiana See at the End of 3 Body Problem?\n\nSection 702 was created in 2008 as part of the FISA Amendments Act, which gave\nthe government the legal authority to conduct warrantless surveillance of\nAmericans who communicate with people outside of the country. The law allows\nthe U.S. intelligence community (most notably the NSA) to conduct \u201ctargeted\nsurveillance\u201d of people outside the U.S. with the \u201ccompelled assistance of\nelectronic communication service providers,\u201d when a government court deems it\nnecessary for national security reasons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the government has said that this surveillance activity is targeted\nexclusively at non-Americans, the law has repeatedly allowed large amounts of\nAmericans\u2019 communications to become ensnared in the government\u2019s net. As the\nBrennan Center, a legal nonprofit associated with NYU, has put it, Section 702\nhas become a \u201cgo-to domestic spying\u201d tool that is used to \u201cconduct hundreds of\nthousands of warrantless \u2018backdoor\u2019 searches for Americans\u2019 private\ncommunications every year.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the past, the government has done much of its spying by tapping the\ninformation flows of online communications providers. Now, however, the new\nupdate would vastly expand the government\u2019s ability to deputize U.S.\nbusinesses to spy on communications. Problematically, the vague language\nwithin the bill makes it difficult to understand what kind of organizations\nwould be called upon to spy for the government and which would be exempted.\n\n\u201cThe definition is incredibly broad,\u201d Kia Hamadanchy, senior federal policy\ncounsel at the ACLU, told Gizmodo. \u201cThere was a version that came out in\nDecember that was hugely problematic.\u201d The new version, which was released\nthis week, now exempts \u201ccertain businesses\u2014like hotels, for instance,\u201d he\nsays. However, the very fact that these carveouts are necessary would seem to\nspeak to the overly broad nature of the bill\u2019s legal reach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a write-up about the most recent iteration of the legislation, legal expert\nMarc Zwillinger describes the broad scope of the proposed law:\n\n> The new amendment would \u2014 notwithstanding these exclusions \u2014 still permit\n> the government to compel the assistance of a wide range of additional\n> entities and persons in conducting surveillance under FISA 702. The breadth\n> of the new definition is obvious from the fact that the drafters felt\n> compelled to exclude such ordinary places such as senior centers, hotels,\n> and coffee shops. But for these specific exceptions, the scope of the new\n> definition would cover them\u2014and scores of businesses that did not receive a\n> specific exemption remain within its purview.\n>\n> And even with these specific exceptions, the definition would include, for\n> example, the owners and operators of facilities that house equipment used to\n> store or carry data, such as data centers and buildings owned by commercial\n> landlords, who merely have access to communications equipment in their\n> physical space. It could also include other persons with access to such\n> facilities and equipment, including delivery personnel, cleaning\n> contractors, and utility providers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other words, the government would be able to deputize an unknown amount of\nthe private sector into acting as its own personal intelligence asset. Indeed,\nHamadanchy gives some examples of companies that might potentially fall under\nthis category and they are numerous: \u201cCommercial landlords, grocery stores,\nbarber shops, hardware shops, fitness centers\u201d or, as he puts it, \u201canyone with\na WiFi\u201d connection.\n\nStill, it remains unclear what, exactly, these companies would be asked to do,\nonce they were involved in said spy work. In the case of commercial landlords,\nfor instance, it seems unclear what role such a business owner might play if\ncalled upon to surveil a target for the government. That said, it\u2019s easy to\nspeculate. \u201cMy assumption is that they would go to the\u201d landlord \u201cand then tap\ninto the WiFi network of that building,\u201d Hamadanchy offered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf all of this doesn\u2019t seem mildly horrifying to you, it probably should.\n\u201cThis is a bad bill,\u201d Hamadanchy said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t do a bad bill. We should\ntake the time to do it right.\u201d Hamadanchy said that the Senate rules could\nallow the policy process to be dragged out until Sunday and that he expected\nthat there might be an effort to strip the bill of its more controversial\npolicies.\n\nNevertheless, the Biden administration has lobbied hard for the bill to pass.\nOn Wednesday, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan released a\nstatement claiming that the new legislation would ensure \u201cthat the U.S.\ngovernment has the tools to protect our national security, while dramatically\nenhancing protections for privacy and civil liberties.\u201d He subsequently called\non the Senate to \u201cquickly send the bill to the President\u2019s desk.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "frontpage": true}
