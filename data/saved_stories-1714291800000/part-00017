This shift in strategy is primarily due to the surveillance\nprowess and destructive capacity of Russian reconnaissance and \u2018kamikaze\u2019\ndrones.\n\nVideo screenshot\n\n  * Russia: We\u2019ll move further west due to MGM-140B supply to Ukraine\n  * Zelenskyy asked for RAF Typhoons and USAF F-35s over Ukraine\n  * Russians \u2018rush\u2019 to capture Chasiv Yar before US help arrives\n\nIn the background details provided by BulgarianMilitary.com, it is worthwhile\nto note that Washington ratified an agreement in early 2023 to ship M1A1\nAbrams tanks to the Ukrainian armed forces. As the year 2023 trailed into the\nonset of 2024, it was confirmed that these stout war machines were effectively\nin Ukrainian hands. However, within just a few weeks of their deployment in\nthe late winter and early spring, five Abrams tanks fell prey to the Russian\narmy\u2019s onslaught. Some Russian sources have claimed the destruction of a sixth\ntank, but the evidence to substantiate this claim is yet to be presented.\n\nLet\u2019s put things into perspective. The Abrams carries a hefty price tag of\naround $10 million each, while Russian \u2018kamikaze\u2019 drones range from a few\nhundred to tens of thousands of dollars, and in some cases, even surpass\n$100,000. As BulgarianMilitary.com speculated back in 2023, Western (and\nRussian) tanks struggle to evade detection because they are easily spotted by\nreconnaissance drones. Once a tank is in sight, it becomes easy pickings for\nthese combat drones\u2014like the Russian Lancet, for example. Given the terrain\nand conditions in Ukraine, it seems the Abrams is strategically unsuitable for\nthe current warfare.\n\nVideo screenshot\n\n## There is no open terrain\n\nThe integration of a so-called \u2018cage cope\u2019 on the turrets of Western tanks, an\ninitiative championed by the armed forces of Ukraine, unfortunately, doesn\u2019t\nensure foolproof protection. We\u2019re living in a new age of warfare, where\ndrones are flipping the tables and exposing the vulnerability of both Russian\nand Western tanks. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re dealing with a T-90 or an\nAbrams, these kamikaze drones can wreak significant damage on armored\nvehicles.\n\nI\u2019d like to remind you of something we first reported back in 2023 on\nBulgarianMilitary.com. The American Abrams tanks aren\u2019t reaching Ukraine with\ntheir original armor intact. The secrets behind their construction and\nmaterials are closely guarded by the U.S. government. While we don\u2019t yet know\nhow well the original armor on U.S. Army tanks holds up against a kamikaze\ndrone attack, we can predict that the de-armored Abrams entering Ukraine may\nstruggle even more.\n\nPhoto credit: Twitter\n\nWith drones increasingly dotting the Ukrainian battlefield, it\u2019s becoming\nclear that there\u2019s no place truly safe for armored vehicles. As a senior\ndefense official starkly put in a discussion last Thursday, \u201cThere is no open\nterrain where you can just drive through without fear of detection.\u201d The\nanonymous official offered insight into the status of U.S. military aid to\nUkraine, on the eve of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meetup. Both Admiral\nChristopher Grady, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and another\ndefense official, who requested anonymity, confirmed the relocation of tanks\naway from the front lines. They assured that the U.S. will reassess tactics in\ncollaboration with the Ukrainians.\n\n## M1A1 in Ukraine\n\nBack in 2023, the U.S.\u2019s decision to donate 31 Abrams tanks to Ukraine\nsignaled a potential shift in power dynamics. However, similar to the current\nsituation with the F-16 fighter jets, experts had previously warned that the\nAbrams might not tip the balance in favor of the Ukrainian military. Russian\nPresident Vladimir Putin echoed these sentiments plainly, stating that Western\ntanks are just as destructible as Russian ones.\n\nPhoto credit: Telegram\n\nThe inaugural Ukrainian tank battalion underwent training on the Abrams in\nGermany in 2023. As Ukraine\u2019s eagerly anticipated counteroffensive continued\nto falter throughout the spring, the need to move from the training ground in\nGermany to the actual battleground with the Abrams became a predictable\nstrategy for breaking through the tough Russian defensive lines.\n\nAs a fallout from the intense combat that raged for months in Avdiivka, a city\nlocated in eastern Ukraine, Russian assaults led to the loss of numerous tanks\non the part of Ukraine. This information was disclosed by a top-ranking\nofficial. One of the factors exacerbating this situation was a significant\ndelay by Congress in authorizing the fresh funding earmarked for Ukraine. This\nsetback forced the Ukrainian military to ration its ammunition supplies. The\nsituation became so dire that they could only manage to counter-attack once\nfor every five or more assaults launched by the Russian forces.\n\n## About US-made tank\n\nPhoto by Spc. Joshua Taeckens\n\nIn the following analysis, we\u2019ll delve into the specifics of the M1A1 Abrams,\na tank valued at an estimated $10 million. The heavyweight M1A1 Abrams,\nrenowned worldwide, is a main battle tank commissioned by the United States.\nIt was introduced in the 1980s as an improved version of the original M1\nAbrams. The M1A1 distinguished itself through its superior armor, firepower,\nand agility features.\n\nAs you\u2019d expect, the M1A1 Abrams is indeed sizeable, fitting its role as a\nmain battle tank. Its approximate dimensions are 32 feet in length, 12 feet in\nwidth, and 8 feet in height. This mammoth machinery carries an impressive\nweight of around 62 metric tons or equivalent to 68 short tons.\n\nEquipped as its primary weapon, the M1A1 Abrams boasts a formidable 120mm M256\nsmoothbore gun. This powerful armament can fire an expansive range of rounds,\ncovering everything from high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) to sabot rounds.\nComplementing this primary firepower, the tank features a .50 caliber M2HB\nheavy machine gun and a pair of 7.62mm M240 machine guns for secondary\ndefense.\n\nPhoto credit: Pan.bg\n\nOne of the major strengths of the Abrams lies in its extraordinary operational\nrange. The tank\u2019s gas turbine engine allows it to cover approximately 265\nmiles on-road on a full tank of fuel. Keep in mind, however, that the actual\ndistance may significantly decrease in off-road conditions, depending on the\nterrain.\n\n\u2018Charge range\u2019 in tank terminology refers to the maximum distance that the\nmain gun can cover. The main 120mm gun of the M1A1 Abrams is capable of\nengaging targets as far as 2,000 meters away, making it a formidable force.\nWith the support of advanced munitions and fire control systems, the Abrams\ncan effectively target and engage adversaries from even longer distances.\n\n## Challenger 2, too\n\nThe Sun video screenshot\n\nInterestingly, the British Challenger 2 tank, now in Ukraine\u2019s possession,\nmirrors the Abrams in many respects. This specific tank has remained unseen on\nthe battlefield longer than its American counterpart, possibly because the\nfirst Russian unit was taken out.\n\nBulgarianMilitary.com previously reported that the proposal to supply Ukraine\nwith the Challenger 2 was met with a stipulation from British sources. They\ninsisted that a discussion between the Ukrainian and British Ministry of\nDefense would ensue if the tank underperformed, focusing on potentially\nremoving them from the frontline.\n\nAs it stands, neither Ukraine nor Britain has made any official comment on the\nmatter. However, it\u2019s noticeable that the Challenger 2 has disappeared from\nthe battlefield, much like the American Abrams. The most logical explanation\nfor this is the tank\u2019s withdrawal, as discussions likely focus on determining\na new, optimized role for it in the conflict, adjusted to the current volatile\nsituation on the frontline.\n\n***\n\nFollow us everywhere and at any time.
