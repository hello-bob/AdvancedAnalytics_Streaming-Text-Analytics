While existing models can accurately predict regions and\n> objects that are likely to attract attention ``on average'', so far there is\n> no scanpath model capable of predicting scanpaths for an individual. To\n> close this gap, we introduce EyeFormer, which leverages a Transformer\n> architecture as a policy network to guide a deep reinforcement learning\n> algorithm that controls gaze locations. Our model has the unique capability\n> of producing personalized predictions when given a few user scanpath\n> samples. It can predict full scanpath information, including fixation\n> positions and duration, across individuals and various stimulus types.\n> Additionally, we demonstrate applications in GUI layout optimization driven\n> by our model. Our software and models will be publicly available.\n\nSubjects:| Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Artificial\nIntelligence (cs.AI); Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC); Machine Learning\n(cs.LG)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.10163 [cs.CV]  \n(or arXiv:2404.10163v2 [cs.CV] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.10163arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Yue Jiang [view email] [v1] Mon, 15 Apr 2024 22:26:27 UTC (23,514 KB)\n[v2] Sun, 21 Apr 2024 03:17:23 UTC (23,515 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled EyeFormer: Predicting Personalized Scanpaths\nwith Transformer-Guided Reinforcement Learning, by Yue Jiang and 4 other\nauthors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CV\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI cs.HC cs.LG\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
