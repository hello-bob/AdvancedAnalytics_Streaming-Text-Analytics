That\u2019s a massive reach\u2014one\nthat comes with a similarly large responsibility. With so many people using\nthe CMS, the WordPress community should always consider strategies for\nimproving the visitor experience. This is where website performance plays a\ncrucial role.\n\nHow fast a web page loads, how quickly a page reacts when you click a button,\nor how smoothly it scrolls can all significantly impact the end-user\nexperience. A more performant site can lead to higher reader engagement and\nmore conversions. Thankfully, over the past few years, the WordPress project\nhas made major performance improvements across the board for the core\nplatform, plugins, and themes.\n\nMany enhancements are available out of the box, with no configuration\nrequired. They improve the website frontend\u2019s performance\u2014the part visitors\nsee\u2014and various parts of the administrative experience, such as the editor.\n\nHere\u2019s a partial list of performance upgrades from the past year:\n\n  * WordPress 6.3 brought several enhancements to image loading. This resulted in an improvement of up to 21% in loading time for any WordPress page with a hero image.\n  * WordPress 6.5 launched with a more efficient translation engine. In benchmark testing, it improved WordPress response time by 23% for all localized WordPress sites. More than 55% of all WordPress sites worldwide use a language other than US English and would benefit from this enhancement.\n  * WordPress 6.5 also included several performance optimizations for the Block Editor, leading to 5x faster typing processing and 2x faster load times when creating or editing content in the site and post editors.\n\nIn addition to the Core enhancements listed above, the WordPress project\ncontinues to work on several efforts that indirectly benefit the ecosystem\u2019s\nperformance.\n\nFor instance, WordPress Core leverages automated tooling for continuously\nmonitoring its performance, covering every product update. This helps measure\nnew features\u2019 performance improvements and enables contributors to detect\npotential performance problems during the development of a new feature or\nrelease so any issues can be proactively addressed long before end users are\naffected. A project is currently underway to make the same tooling used by\nWordPress Core developers available to plugin and theme authors as well.\n\nAdditionally, the new WordPress plugin checker allows checking any plugin for\nperformance best practices, among other requirements and recommendations. The\nplugin checker should lead to more performance awareness in plugin authors\nand, eventually, faster plugins. If you develop plugins, consider integrating\nthis tool into your development and testing workflow.\n\nLast but not least, WordPress 6.5 introduced the Interactivity API, which is a\ntechnical foundation that facilitates more performant user interactions. This\nnew infrastructure drastically simplifies the implementation of interactive\nwebsite features and can even centrally control certain aspects of\nperformance, keeping multiple independent plugins operating efficiently.\n\nThese performance updates result from a collaborative effort from all corners\nof the community, including the WordPress Performance Team. This team, founded\nin 2021, underscores the WordPress project\u2019s commitment to performance. And\nthe results are substantial: Compared to a year ago, 8% more WordPress sites\ndeliver good load time performance at scale\u2014significantly better than the\noverall web\u2019s 5.5% load time improvement. The web is getting more performant,\nand WordPress is leading the way.\n\nWordPress contributors are determined to continue this trend by working on\nfurther performance iterations. Whether you\u2019re a WordPress end user,\nadministrator, site builder, or developer, you can contribute to this effort.\nAnyone can test the performance features before being released in Core through\nindividual feature plugins. Each feature can be tested via the Performance Lab\nplugin, so please try them! Testing features early helps the team assess their\nimpact and collect valuable feedback.\n\nAre you eager for more WordPress performance news and updates? Then check out\nthe 2024 performance roadmap. Thanks to the entire community for your hard\nwork. Not only does it ensure WordPress\u2019 continued improvement and growth, but\nit benefits the entire open web.\n\nThank you to @annezazu @clarkeemily @tweetythierry @swissspidy @westonruter\n@adamsilverstein @joemcgill for content review and @provenself @dansoschin for\neditorial review.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * Email\n\n## Get the Latest Updates\n\n### Subscribe to WordPress News\n\nJoin 17.3K other subscribers\n\n### WP Briefing \u2014 The WordPress Podcast\n\nJoin Josepha Haden and Matt Mullenweg to learn about where WordPress is going\nand how you can get involved.\n\n  * Apple Podcasts\n  * Google Podcasts\n  * Pocket Casts\n  * RSS\n  * Spotify\n  * Stitcher\n\nListen to all episodes\n\n  * Visit our Facebook page\n  * Visit our X (formerly Twitter) account\n  * Visit our Instagram account\n  * Visit our LinkedIn account\n  * Visit our YouTube channel\n\n", "frontpage": false}
