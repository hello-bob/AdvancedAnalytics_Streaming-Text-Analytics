This\narticle explains various reasons why Firefox may make a connection to the\nInternet and how you can stop it from doing so, if you wish.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n  * 1 Automatic updates and Security\n\n    * 1.1 Auto-update checking\n    * 1.2 Blocklist updating\n    * 1.3 Anti-phishing and malware protection lists updating\n    * 1.4 Tracking protection list updating\n    * 1.5 Secure website certificates\n    * 1.6 Login breach information\n  * 2 Prefetching\n\n    * 2.1 Link prefetching\n    * 2.2 DNS prefetching\n    * 2.3 Speculative pre-connections\n    * 2.4 Add-on list prefetching\n  * 3 User-invoked content\n\n    * 3.1 Home page loading\n    * 3.2 Extensions\n    * 3.3 Downloads restarted\n    * 3.4 Search plugin icon loading\n    * 3.5 Firefox Sync\n  * 4 Mozilla content\n\n    * 4.1 Contextual feature recommendations and other notifications\n    * 4.2 Experiments or studies\n    * 4.3 Geolocation for default search engine\n    * 4.4 \u201cWhat's new\u201d page\n    * 4.5 Add-on metadata updating\n  * 5 Diagnostics\n  * 6 Media capabilities\n\n    * 6.1 OpenH264 codec\n    * 6.2 DRM content\n    * 6.3 WebRTC\n  * 7 Network Detection\n  * 8 Malware\n  * 9 Loopback connection\n\n# Automatic updates and Security\n\n## Auto-update checking\n\nWarning: Disabling update checking is not recommended and will leave you open\nto security vulnerabilities that get fixed in newer versions.\n\nFirefox occasionally checks to see if any updates are available for itself and\nfor your search engines. The ability to disable Firefox update checking was\nremoved in Firefox 63. Advanced users and IT administrators can use a policy\nto disable Firefox update checks. See Managing Firefox Updates.\n\nFirefox also checks to see if any updates are available for your add-ons\n(extensions, themes). To disable this check:\n\n  1. Click the menu button , click Add-ons and themes and select Extensions.\n  2. At the top of the tab, click the Tools for all add-ons menu, uncheck Update Add-ons Automatically and then select Reset All Add-ons to Update Automatically.\n\n## Blocklist updating\n\nWarning: Disabling the blocklist is not recommended, as it may result in you\nusing untrustworthy add-ons, revoked certificates or unstable graphics\ndrivers.\n\nFirefox may be updating its blocklist, which is used to block malicious\nextensions, vulnerable plugins, revoked certificates and graphics drivers\nknown to cause crashes. For more information, see Add-ons Blocking Process\n(Firefox Extension Workshop), Blocklisting/Graphics (MozillaWiki), Revoking\nIntermediate Certificates: Introducing OneCRL (Mozilla Security Blog) and the\nAdd-ons that cause stability or security issues are put on a blocklist\narticle. To disable this feature:\n\n  1. Type about:config in the address bar and press EnterReturn. A warning page may appear. Click Accept the Risk and Continue to go to the about:config page.\n  2. In the about:config page, search for the preference extensions.blocklist.enabled.\n  3. Observe the Value column of the extensions.blocklist.enabled row.\n\n     * If it is set to false then do nothing.\n     * If it is set to true, double-click it to set it to false.\n\n## Anti-phishing and malware protection lists updating\n\nWarning: Disabling phishing and malware protection is not recommended, as it\nwill leave you vulnerable to malicious or unwanted downloads and to\nuntrustworthy websites that try to steal your financial information and/or\nyour identity.\n\nPhishing, unwanted software and malware protection lists may be updating. To\nturn this off:\n\n  1. In the Menu bar at the top of the screen, click Firefox and then select Preferences or Settings, depending on your macOS version.Click the menu button and select Settings.\n  2. Select the Privacy & Security panel.\n  3. Uncheck Block dangerous and deceptive content.\n\nIn addition, when you download an application file, Firefox will verify its\nsignature. If it is signed, Firefox then compares the signature with a list of\nknown safe publishers. For files that are not identified by the lists as\n\u201csafe\u201d (allowed) or as \u201cmalware\u201d (blocked), Firefox asks Google\u2019s Safe\nBrowsing service if the software is safe by sending it some of the download\u2019s\nmetadata. To turn off this part of malware protection:\n\n  1. Type about:config in the address bar and press EnterReturn. A warning page may appear. Click Accept the Risk and Continue to go to the about:config page.\n  2. In the about:config page, search for the preference browser.safebrowsing.downloads.remote.enabled.\n  3. Observe the Value column of the browser.safebrowsing.downloads.remote.enabled row.\n\n     * If it is set to false then do nothing.\n     * If it is set to true then double-click it to set it to false.\n\n## Tracking protection list updating\n\nThe tracking protection list may be updating itself. To turn this off:\n\n  1. In the Menu bar at the top of the screen, click Firefox and then select Preferences or Settings, depending on your macOS version.Click the menu button and select Settings.\n  2. Select the Privacy & Security panel.\n  3. Under Enhanced Tracking Protection, choose the Custom setting.\n  4. Uncheck Tracking content.\n\n## Secure website certificates\n\nWhen you visit a secure website (i.e. \u201chttps\u201d), Firefox will validate the\nwebsite's certificate. This may involve communicating with a third-party\nstatus provider specified by the certificate over a protocol named OCSP to\nconfirm that the certificate is still valid. To turn this off:\n\n  1. In the Menu bar at the top of the screen, click Firefox and then select Preferences or Settings, depending on your macOS version.Click the menu button and select Settings.\n  2. Select the Privacy & Security panel.\n  3. In the Security section under Certificates, uncheck Query OCSP responder servers to confirm the current validity of certificates.\n\n## Login breach information\n\nFirefox Monitor warns you if your online accounts were involved in a known\ndata breach. For more information, see Firefox Password Manager - Alerts for\nbreached websites.\n\nTo get the latest login breach information and more, Firefox connects to\nfirefox.settings.services.mozilla.com\n\n# Prefetching\n\n## Link prefetching\n\nFirefox will prefetch certain links if any of the websites you are viewing\nuses the special prefetch-link tag. For more information, please see the Link\nPrefetching FAQ. To disable Link prefetching:\n\n  1. Type about:config in the address bar and press EnterReturn. A warning page may appear. Click Accept the Risk and Continue to go to the about:config page.\n  2. In the about:config page, search for the preference network.prefetch-next.\n  3. Observe the Value column of the network.prefetch-next row.\n\n     * If it is set to false then do nothing.\n     * If it is set to true, double-click it to set it to false.\n\n## DNS prefetching\n\nIn order to reduce latency, Firefox will proactively perform domain name\nresolution on links that the user may choose to follow as well as URLs for\nitems referenced by elements in a web page. For more information, please see\nthe DNS Prefetching blog post. To disable DNS prefetching:\n\n  1. Type about:config in the address bar and press EnterReturn. A warning page may appear. Click Accept the Risk and Continue to go to the about:config page.\n  2. In the about:config page, search for the preference network.dns.disablePrefetch.\n  3. Observe the Value column of the network.dns.disablePrefetch row.\n\n     * If it is set to true then do nothing.\n     * If it is set to false, double-click it to set it to true.\n\n## Speculative pre-connections\n\nTo improve the loading speed, Firefox will open predictive connections to\nsites when the user hovers their mouse over thumbnails on the New Tab page or\nthe user starts to search in the Search Bar, or in the search field on the\nHome or the New Tab page. In case the user follows through with the action,\nthe page can begin loading faster since some of the work was already started\nin advance. To disable this feature:\n\n  1. Type about:config in the address bar and press EnterReturn. A warning page may appear. Click Accept the Risk and Continue to go to the about:config page.\n  2. In the about:config page, search for the preference network.http.speculative-parallel-limit.\n  3. Observe the Value column of the network.http.speculative-parallel-limit row.\n\n     * If it is set to 0 then do nothing.\n     * If it is set to a different value, double-click it to set it to 0.\n\n## Add-on list prefetching\n\nEach time the Add-ons manager is opened, Firefox prefetches a list of add-ons\nto improve responsiveness of the Recommendations panel. This connection is not\nmade if the add-ons manager is not opened.\n\n# User-invoked content\n\n## Home page loading\n\nTo set your home page to something that doesn't generate connections to the\nInternet:\n\n  1. In the Menu bar at the top of the screen, click Firefox and then select Preferences or Settings, depending on your macOS version.Click the menu button and select Settings.\n  2. Select the Home panel.\n  3. Under New Windows and Tabs:\n\n     * in the drop-down menu after Homepage and new windows, select Blank Page.\n     * in the drop-down menu after New tabs, select Blank Page.\n  4. Close the about:preferences page.\n\n## Extensions\n\nAn extension you have installed may be making a connection to a website that\nit relies on. For example, a connection to a website to synchronize your\nbookmarks, a connection to a website to update a list of sites to block, etc.\nOr it is possible an extension could be changing the expected behavior of\nFirefox in other ways. For example, FasterFox extension has an option to\nprefetch all links. To disable or remove your extensions, see Disable or\nremove Add-ons.\n\nFirefox also checks to see if any updates are available for your add-ons\n(extensions, themes). To disable this check:\n\nWarning: Disabling add-on update checking is not recommended and leaves you\nopen to security vulnerabilities that get fixed in newer versions.\n\n  1. Click the menu button , click Add-ons and themes and select Extensions.\n  2. At the top of the tab, click the Tools for all add-ons menu, uncheck Update Add-ons Automatically and then select Reset All Add-ons to Update Automatically.\n\n## Downloads restarted\n\nWhen you start Firefox, any interrupted downloads from your previous browsing\nsession may be automatically resumed.\n\n  1. Press Ctrl + JCtrl + Shift + YCommand + J to open the Downloads window.\n  2. Ensure nothing is currently being downloaded.\n\n## Search plugin icon loading\n\nWhen you add a custom search plugin that doesn't come with an included icon,\nFirefox might look up the icon at a remote address that is specified in the\nsearch plugin once and cache it for future use.\n\n## Firefox Sync\n\nIf you're using Firefox Sync, it will establish regular connections in order\nto synchronize your data to Mozilla's Sync servers and across your connected\ndevices. In order to choose what data gets synchronized or to disconnect from\nSync, see How do I choose what information to sync on Firefox?\n\n# Mozilla content\n\nNote: The Configuration Editor for Firefox article describes in detail how to\nuse about:config to modify preferences.\n\n## Contextual feature recommendations and other notifications\n\nFirefox may make feature recommendations specific to a type of website you're\non or relevant to a current task. You can disable connections by setting\nbrowser.newtabpage.activity-stream.feeds.asrouterfeed to false by double-\nclicking it.\n\n## Experiments or studies\n\n  * To disable new feature experiments, set messaging-system.rsexperimentloader.enabled to false.\n  * To disable the running of experiments, set app.normandy.optoutstudies.enabled to false. This is not necessary if app.normandy.enable is also set to false.\n  * To disable studies, feature rollouts and emergency hotfixes related to Normandy, set app.normandy.enabled to false.\n\n## Geolocation for default search engine\n\nIn order to set the right default search engine for your location, Firefox\nwill perform a geolocation lookup once by contacting Mozilla's servers and\nstore the country-level result locally. This connection happens on the first\nstart of Firefox \u2013 in case you want to prohibit that, you will have to\npreconfigure the browser and set the browser.search.geoip.url preference to a\nblank string.\n\n## \u201cWhat's new\u201d page\n\nAfter a browser update, Firefox might show an additional tab next to your\nusual homepage to offer more information on changes or new features included\nin the update. To disable this page from being shown:\n\n  1. Type about:config in the address bar and press EnterReturn. A warning page may appear. Click Accept the Risk and Continue to go to the about:config page.\n  2. In the about:config page, search for the preference browser.startup.homepage_override.mstone.\n  3. Double-click it and set its value to ignore.\n\n## Add-on metadata updating\n\nThe Add-ons manager displays information about each add-on you have installed\nand provides personalized recommendations in the Recommandations panel. To\nkeep this data updated, Firefox will request information from the Mozilla Add-\nons gallery once a day (for more information, see this blog post). To disable\nthese updates:\n\n  1. Type about:config in the address bar and press EnterReturn. A warning page may appear. Click Accept the Risk and Continue to go to the about:config page.\n  2. In the about:config page, search for the preference extensions.getAddons.cache.enabled.\n  3. Observe the Value column of the extensions.getAddons.cache.enabled row.\n\n     * If it is set to false then do nothing.\n     * If it is set to true, double-click it to set it to false.\n\n# Diagnostics\n\nFirefox can submit certain diagnostics data, including Telemetry and Crash\nReports data to Mozilla, to provide information that helps improve the\nbrowser. You can disable sharing of this data in Firefox Settings . To disable\nthe sharing of this data:\n\n  1. In the Menu bar at the top of the screen, click Firefox and then select Preferences or Settings, depending on your macOS version.Click the menu button and select Settings.\n  2. Select the Privacy & Security panel.\n  3. Uncheck the boxes under the section Firefox Data Collection and Use.\n\nIn addition, Mozilla will ask a small sample of users to rate their experience\nwith Firefox to get a better insight into the sentiment about the browser. For\nmore information about this, see Firefox/Shield/Heartbeat (MozillaWiki). The\nrating feature will establish a connection to Mozilla's servers at startup,\nwhich you can turn off like this:\n\n  1. Type about:config in the address bar and press EnterReturn. A warning page may appear. Click Accept the Risk and Continue to go to the about:config page.\n  2. Find the preference app.normandy.enabled.\n  3. Set the preference value to false by double-clicking it.\n\n# Media capabilities\n\n## OpenH264 codec\n\nFirefox will make use of the OpenH264 codec provided by Cisco in order to\nsupport the H.264 video codec in WebRTC, a technology allowing for peer-to-\npeer video communication on the web. For more information about this, see the\nOpenH264 Now in Firefox blog post.\n\nThe OpenH264 codec is not distributed with Firefox but gets downloaded at the\nfirst start of Firefox. In case you want to prohibit that, you will have to\npreconfigure the browser and set the media.gmp-gmpopenh264.enabled preference\nto false.\n\n## DRM content\n\nTo disable this feature, see Watch DRM content on Firefox.\n\n## WebRTC\n\nWebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a technology which provides direct\nbrowser-to-browser communication (audio, video, filesharing). As it is drafted\nand implemented at the moment, WebRTC can lead to your local IP address being\nexposed to websites even when you are behind a VPN or a NAT router \u2013 in the\nWebRTC API this data would be used to set up a peer-to-peer connection between\ntwo local clients.\n\nFor different methods and granular controls on how to mitigate this issue, see\nMedia/WebRTC/Privacy Media/WebRTC/Privacy Media/WebRTC/Privacy Mozilla Wiki\npage.\n\n# Network Detection\n\nFirefox's captive portal feature tests whether your network connection\nrequires logging in, for example, on a public Wi-Fi hotspot, by regularly\nconnecting to http://detectportal.firefox.com/success.txt. Firefox will also\nmake connections to this URL to check if your current network supports IPv6.\n\nTo disable this feature:\n\n  1. Type about:config in the address bar and press EnterReturn. A warning page may appear. Click Accept the Risk and Continue to go to the about:config page.\n  2. In the about:config page, search for the preference network.captive-portal-service.enabled (for example, you can type portal in the search box above the list and pause while the list is filtered).\n  3. Observe the Value column of the network.captive-portal-service.enabled row.\n\n     * If it is set to false then do nothing.\n     * If it is set to true, double-click it to set it to false.\n  4. In the about:config page, search for the preference network.connectivity-service.enabled (for example, you can type connectivity in the search box above the list and pause while the list is filtered).\n  5. Observe the Value column of the network.connectivity-service.enabled row.\n\n     * If it is set to false then do nothing.\n     * If it is set to true, double-click it to set it to false.\n\n# Malware\n\nIf your computer is infected with a virus, trojan, spyware or other malicious\nsoftware, then Firefox's Internet connection may be being piggybacked in order\nfor the malware to communicate with its author or to deliver advertisements,\netc. If you suspect this is the case, consider seeking advice from a forum\nspecializing in malware removal. For more information, see Troubleshoot\nFirefox issues caused by malware.\n\n# Loopback connection\n\nNote: This does not apply to Linux systems.\n\nA loopback connection (to IP address 127.0.0.1) can be made by Firefox on non-\nUnix machines. In this case the browser is communicating with itself as\nexpected, and it is not recommended that this communication be blocked. See\nbug 100154 for more information.\n\nBased on information from Connections established on startup - Firefox\n(mozillaZine KB)\n\nShare this article: http://mzl.la/1DFDuS2\n\nThese fine people helped write this article:\n\nAliceWyman, Chris Ilias, philipp, jscher2000 - Support Volunteer, novica,\nTonnes, Michele Rodaro, user66338, Michael Verdi, scoobidiver, Swarnava\nSengupta, ideato, Mozinet, Younghwan Kwon, Mike Cooper, Francois Marier,\nuser832823, Wesley Branton, user917725, Lan, Marcus320, Imen, Joni, Artist,\ngijs, lebonvent, YD, Bartz, ke5trel, Valentin, Trevor\n\n### Volunteer\n\nGrow and share your expertise with others.
