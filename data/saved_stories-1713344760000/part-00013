One question that comes up is the issue of taxes. (You can\nnever avoid taxes. Taxes are due today for most people in the United States.)\n\nIf the employees were allowed to keep the software provided they tested the\nprogram and filed bugs against it, did that count as work compensation that\nbecame taxable income?\n\nThe thing is, nobody ever checked whether you tested the program you took, and\nit was obvious to everybody participating in the activity, seeing as you just\npicked up the software and walked out of the room without filling out any\npaperwork. You were assumed to be a well-meaning member of the team who\nwouldn\u2019t show up for an activity without any intention of doing it. The\nexpectation that you test the program was just that: An expectation. It wasn\u2019t\na condition.\n\nMy understanding is that this makes the software count as a gift that falls\nunder the de minimis rule of the United States tax code. This was a one-time\nthing, so the frequency criterion is met. The value of the software was well\nunder $100, so that requirement was met. And since nobody actually kept track\nof who took which software, the administrative impracticality requirement was\nalso satisfied.\n\nBut really, this was just a development manager taking it upon himself to do\nsome unconventional application compatibility test coverage and to instill\ncamaraderie at the same time.\n\nBonus chatter: During one of the many iterations of this story being retold,\nsomeone remarked that they got a copy of the video game Wing Commander III\nthrough this exercise. I immediately remembered that they fulfilled their\nexpectation by filing a bug against Windows 95: When you earned the cloaking\ndevice on level 58 or something, you couldn\u2019t activate it.\n\nFortunately, they provided a save-game at level 58, so I didn\u2019t have to play\nall the way to level 58 by myself.\n\nThe problem was that the hotkey for activating the cloaking device was Ctrl+C,\nand that conflicted with the use of Ctrl+C to cancel an active clipboard paste\noperation into an MS-DOS session. Normally, Windows 95 realized that there was\nno active paste active and replayed the hotkey into the MS-DOS session.\nHowever, the replay of the hotkey was apparently too fast for this game to\nrecognize, so it never activated the cloaking device.\n\nI fixed it by changing Windows 95 so that it installed the Ctrl+C hotkey\nhandler only when a clipboard paste operation was active, and removed it when\nthe paste operation completed. That way, when you hit it outside of a paste\noperation, the keys were visible to the game at human speeds, and this allowed\nit to engage the cloaking device.\n\n### Raymond Chen\n\nFollow\n\nTagged History\n\n### Read next\n\nSubroutine calls in the ancient world, before computers had stacks or heaps\n\nA lot of computing got done even before we had stacks and heaps.\n\nRaymond Chen April 1, 2024\n\n19 comments\n\nWhat is a hard error, and what makes it harder than an easy error?\n\nA throwback to the early days of 16-bit Windows.\n\nRaymond Chen January 16, 2024\n\n4 comments\n\n## 2 comments\n\n### Leave a commentCancel reply\n\nLog in to join the discussion or edit/delete existing comments.\n\n  * Erik Fjeldstrom April 15, 2024 12:07 pm 1\n\nSo you put a cloaking device on the Ctrl+C handler?\n\nLog in to Vote or Reply\n\n  * Michael McGuire April 16, 2024 2:14 pm 0\n\nI was an alpha tester of Windows 92 XX 93 XX 94 XX 95. I filed quite a few\nbugs on it. One was quite serious, it killed my software when they tried to\nextend the Window Handles addressing.
