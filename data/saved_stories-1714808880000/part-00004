Now we\u2019ve seen\nthe email that Tesla has sent to suppliers, and it\u2019s not pretty.\n\nWhen the firings were announced Monday night, there was little information\nabout how they would affect Tesla\u2019s plans.\n\nOn Tuesday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that \u201cTesla still plans to grow the\nSupercharger network, just at a slower pace for new locations and more focus\non 100% uptime and expansion of existing locations.\u201d According to Tesla\u2019s\nwebsite, Superchargers currently have 99.95% uptime.\n\nBut in the interim, we\u2019ve already heard about Supercharger projects being\ncancelled, including halting rollout in the entire country of Australia,\nincluding sites that had already been subject to long-term leases and given\nthe go-ahead for construction which will now be abandoned.\n\nAnd Tesla has also sent out an email to all of its suppliers, which leaked to\nthe internet. Here it is in full, but with contact information redacted:\n\n> To all concerned:\n>\n> You may be aware that there has been a recent adjustment with the\n> Supercharger organization which is presently undergoing a sudden and\n> thorough restructuring. If you have already received this email, please\n> disregard it as we are attempting to connect with our suppliers and\n> contractors. As part of this process, we are in the midst of establishing\n> new leadership roles, prioritizing projects, and streamlining our payment\n> procedures. Due to the transitional nature of this phase, we are asking for\n> your patience with our response time.\n>\n> I understand that this period of change may be challenging and that patience\n> is not easy when expecting to be paid, however, I want to express my sincere\n> appreciation for your understanding and support as we navigate through this\n> transition. At this time, please hold on breaking ground on any newly\n> awarded construction projects and planned pre-construction walks. If\n> currently working on an active Supercharging construction site, please\n> continue. Contact [email redacted] for further questions, comments, and\n> concerns. Additionally, hold on working on any new material orders. Contact\n> [email redacted] for further questions, comments, and concerns. If waiting\n> on delayed payment, please contact [email redacted] for a status update.\n> Thank you for your cooperation and patience.\n\nThe email is remarkable for several reasons, largely because it shows a lack\nof structure and consideration to the decision to fire the entire team.\n\nFirstly, Tesla states that it is \u201cattempting\u201d to connect with suppliers and\nthat it may have sent multiple emails to some of them. This suggests that\nTesla doesn\u2019t have an established method of contact for all of its suppliers \u2013\neither it doesn\u2019t have a master contact list, or its previous method including\npoints of contact within Tesla is not usable because, well, those points of\ncontact would have been fired.\n\nSecond, it says that the \u201cadjustment\u201d (an odd word for firing an entire\ndepartment) has led to a process of establishing new leadership roles. This is\ntypically something that a company would consider before changing leaders, and\nensure that there are current employees with experience who are ready to step\nup to take the position of a retiring leader, perhaps with a period of\nmentorship prior to the outgoing leader\u2019s retirement.\n\nEven in a situation where a firing is sudden, it\u2019s typically reasonable to\nelevate a previous second-in-command to fill the void. This is why it\u2019s\nbeneficial to have a deep bench \u2013 something which Tesla has touted before.\n\nThird, Tesla goes on to mention that these suppliers are \u201cexpecting to be\npaid,\u201d which suggests that Tesla is likely to welch on its payment\nobligations, at least in the short term. We have seen Musk refuse to pay bills\nbefore, so mention of skipping out on payment must raise alarm bells for\nsuppliers who have been working in good faith with Tesla.\n\nFinally, Tesla asks for suppliers to continue construction on active projects,\nbut to hold on breaking ground or doing pre-construction site walks. This\ncould be considered unclear, as there are many parallel steps to approval,\npermitting and construction of sites, so it\u2019s hard to set a single line that\nis easily communicated about which sites should continue and which sites\nshouldn\u2019t. Presumably, site contacts within Tesla would be able to reach out\nto individual sites and tell them whether to continue construction or not \u2013 if\nthey were still working there, which it seems they are not.\n\nOther charging providers have reacted to Tesla\u2019s disruption of its own\nSupercharger plans, with at least one company, Revel, suggesting that it\u2019s\nready to swoop in on \u201creally good sites\u201d that Tesla left on the table,\nparticularly in Revel\u2019s home in New York City.\n\n## Electrek\u2019s Take\n\nTo ask for patience is reasonable when an unforeseen circumstance hits a\ncompany, but this is not an unforeseen circumstance \u2013 it is entirely self-\ninflicted by Musk\u2019s seemingly haphazard decision to fire... everyone.\n\nWe have heard from several sources who told us that the reason for these\nfirings is because Rebecca Tinucci, former head of Tesla\u2019s EV Charging\ndivision, resisted Musk\u2019s demand to fire large portions of her team.\n\nWhile this is hearsay, it\u2019s plausible considering the language in Musk\u2019s\nletter announcing the firings \u2013 which claimed that some executives are not\ntaking headcount reduction seriously, and made a point to say that executives\nwho retain the wrong employees may see themselves and their whole teams cut.\nIt isn\u2019t a stretch to think that Musk included those demands since they were\nrelated to his firing of Tinucci and her team.\n\nThe Supercharging team was one of the more successful and crucial teams within\nTesla, and many observers consider the Supercharger network to be Tesla\u2019s\nprimary \u201cmoat\u201d that makes it better than the competition. Tinucci was also\nresponsible for negotiating NACS agreements across the industry, leading to a\nhuge win when Tesla\u2019s plug became the de facto standard after basically every\nautomaker adopted it over the course of the last year.\n\nSuperchargers are also incredibly important, especially in North America. In\nEurope there are more successful non-Tesla charge providers, but in NA, Tesla\nis the big dog. And if infrastructure is important, then Tesla pulling back is\nbad not just for Tesla but for EVs as a whole.\n\n> This is not a good look for the North American EV charging infrastructure\n> after the inevitable slowdown in Superchargers due to Elon's rash decision\n> to fire the entire charging team. pic.twitter.com/1JTYsO92TU\n>\n> \u2014 Fred Lambert (@FredericLambert) May 3, 2024\n\nIt seems abundantly clear that, whatever explanation we accept, the firing of\nthe Supercharger team was not well-considered (and our readers seem to agree).\nEven if headcount reduction is necessary, the whole team shouldn\u2019t be laid\noff. Even if it was necessary as a retaliatory measure \u2013 which would not be a\ngood rationale \u2013 it still would be wiser to retain some part of it so as to\navoid the chaos evident in the email above.\n\n## Top comment by CMG30\n\nLiked by 32 people\n\nThis is just further evidence to the appearance that Elon is operating on\nimpulse with no real consideration to the ramifications of his actions. I've\nseen no convincing reason given for the pullback in the Supercharger program.\nIt doesn't seem to benefit Tesla, nor does it benefit the industry.\n\nWorst of all, it really throws other automakers into chaos. Tom Moloughney\nstated today that he has heard from his industry contacts that at least one\nmajor automaker has had a serious meeting already to decide if they should\ncontinue with the NACS adoption. He further reported that some of his industry\ncontacts have reached out to him to see if he has any way to literally contact\nanyone still in the SC department at Tesla because Tesla has agreements with\nthese automakers to work together to onboard them into the system and suddenly\neveryone is just gone.\n\nPure chaos. Even if you're so deep into the cult to believe that Elon did the\nright thing here there is no rational excuse for the way it was done.\n\nView all comments\n\nWhatever mechanism led to the firing, it does fit into a pattern of\nincreasingly erratic behavior that Musk has been showing lately.\n\nMany possible explanations have been advanced to explain this behavior, and\nmost of them don\u2019t increase my personal faith that Musk will make the right\ndecisions with Tesla.\n\nAs I said in our original post about Tesla\u2019s first round of layoffs, we do\nneed Tesla to keep pushing the industry forward. While Pandora\u2019s box is open\nand EVs are here to stay at this point, regardless of Tesla\u2019s ups and downs,\nthe rest of the industry is still trying hard to pump the brakes on the\ntransition, even if it means America will be less competitive if those\ncompanies get their way.\n\nTesla is one of the few entities that is large enough and committed enough to\ndragging those timelines forward, whether the rest of the industry likes it or\nnot. We need a healthy Tesla, and for that, we need steadier management. This\nlayoff decision and subsequent email is not an example of that \u2013 and neither\nare most of Musk\u2019s managerial actions recently.\n\nAdd Electrek to your Google News feed.\n\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
