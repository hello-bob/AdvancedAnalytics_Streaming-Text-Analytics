Selcuk Uluagac\n\nProfessor of Computing and Information Science, Florida International\nUniversity\n\n### Disclosure statement\n\nThis research was completed in 2023 and received partial funding from US\nNational Science Foundation, Cyber Florida, and Google ASPIRE. The views\nexpressed are those of the author only, not of the funding agencies. The\nauthor also thanks the developers of the FSA API at Google for their support\nand cooperation for the original USENIX Security paper in 2023.\n\n### Partners\n\nFlorida International University provides funding as a member of The\nConversation US.\n\nView all partners\n\n#####\n\nWe believe in the free flow of information\n\n###### Republish our articles for free, online or in print, under Creative\nCommons licence.\n\nAvoiding iffy downloads is no longer enough to ensure this doesn\u2019t happen.\nOlemedia/iStock via Getty Images\n\nEmail\n\nX (Twitter)\n\nFacebook47\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nMessenger\n\nPrint\n\nYou probably know better than to click on links that download unknown files\nonto your computer. It turns out that uploading files can get you into\ntrouble, too.\n\nToday\u2019s web browsers are much more powerful than earlier generations of\nbrowsers. They\u2019re able to manipulate data within both the browser and the\ncomputer\u2019s local file system. Users can send and receive email, listen to\nmusic or watch a movie within a browser with the click of a button.\n\nUnfortunately, these capabilities also mean that hackers can find clever ways\nto abuse the browsers to trick you into letting ransomware lock up your files\nwhen you think that you\u2019re simply doing your usual tasks online.\n\nI\u2019m a computer scientist who studies cybersecurity. My colleagues and I have\nshown how hackers can gain access to your computer\u2019s files via the File System\nAccess Application Programming Interface (API), which enables web applications\nin modern browsers to interact with the users\u2019 local file systems.\n\nThe threat applies to Google\u2019s Chrome and Microsoft\u2019s Edge browsers but not\nApple\u2019s Safari or Mozilla\u2019s Firefox. Chrome accounts for 65% of browsers used,\nand Edge accounts for 5%. To the best of my knowledge, there have been no\nreports of hackers using this method so far.\n\nMy colleagues, who include a Google security researcher, and I have\ncommunicated with the developers responsible for the File System Access API,\nand they have expressed support for our work and interest in our approaches to\ndefending against this kind of attack. We also filed a security report to\nMicrosoft but have not heard from them.\n\n## Double-edged sword\n\nToday\u2019s browsers are almost operating systems unto themselves. They can run\nsoftware programs and encrypt files. These capabilities, combined with the\nbrowser\u2019s access to the host computer\u2019s files \u2013 including ones in the cloud,\nshared folders and external drives \u2013 via the File System Access API creates a\nnew opportunity for ransomware.\n\nImagine you want to edit photos on a benign-looking free online photo editing\ntool. When you upload the photos for editing, any hackers who control the\nmalicious editing tool can access the files on your computer via your browser.\nThe hackers would gain access to the folder you are uploading from and all\nsubfolders. Then the hackers could encrypt the files in your file system and\ndemand a ransom payment to decrypt them.\n\nToday\u2019s web browsers are more powerful \u2013 and in some ways more vulnerable \u2013\nthan their predecessors.\n\nRansomware is a growing problem. Attacks have hit individuals as well as\norganizations, including Fortune 500 companies, banks, cloud service\nproviders, cruise operators, threat-monitoring services, chip manufacturers,\ngovernments, medical centers and hospitals, insurance companies, schools,\nuniversities and even police departments. In 2023, organizations paid more\nthan US$1.1 billion in ransomware payments to attackers, and 19 ransomware\nattacks targeted organizations every second.\n\nIt is no wonder ransomware is the No. 1 arms race today between hackers and\nsecurity specialists. Traditional ransomware runs on your computer after\nhackers have tricked you into downloading it.\n\n## New defenses for a new threat\n\nA team of researchers I lead at the Cyber-Physical Systems Security Lab at\nFlorida International University, including postdoctoral researcher Abbas Acar\nand Ph.D. candidate Harun Oz, in collaboration with Google Senior Research\nScientist G\u00fcliz Seray Tuncay, have been investigating this new type of\npotential ransomware for the past two years. Specifically, we have been\nexploring how powerful modern web browsers have become and how they can be\nweaponized by hackers to create novel forms of ransomware.\n\nIn our paper, R\u00f8B: Ransomware over Modern Web Browsers, which was presented at\nthe USENIX Security Symposium in August 2023, we showed how this emerging\nransomware strain is easy to design and how damaging it can be. In particular,\nwe designed and implemented the first browser-based ransomware called R\u00f8B and\nanalyzed its use with browsers running on three different major operating\nsystems \u2013 Windows, Linux and MacOS \u2013 five cloud providers and five antivirus\nproducts.\n\nOur evaluations showed that R\u00f8B is capable of encrypting numerous types of\nfiles. Because R\u00f8B runs within the browser, there are no malicious payloads\nfor a traditional antivirus program to catch. This means existing ransomware\ndetection systems face several issues against this powerful browser-based\nransomware.\n\nWe proposed three different defense approaches to mitigate this new ransomware\ntype. These approaches operate at different levels \u2013 browser, file system and\nuser \u2013 and complement one another.\n\nThe first approach temporarily halts a web application \u2013 a program that runs\nin the browser \u2013 in order to detect encrypted user files. The second approach\nmonitors the activity of the web application on the user\u2019s computer to\nidentify ransomware-like patterns. The third approach introduces a new\npermission dialog box to inform users about the risks and implications\nassociated with allowing web applications to access their computer\u2019s file\nsystem.\n\nWhen it comes to protecting your computer, be careful about where you upload\nas well as download files. Your uploads could be giving hackers an \u201cin\u201d to\nyour computer.\n\n  * Web browsers\n  * Computer security\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Hackers\n  * Technology\n  * Ransomware\n\n### Events\n\nMore events\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * ##### Executive Dean, Faculty of Health\n\n  * ##### Regional Engagement Officer - Shepparton\n\n  * ##### Lecturer/Senior Lecturer, Earth System Science (School of Science)\n\n  * ##### Sydney Horizon Educators (Identified)\n\n  * ##### Deputy Social Media Producer\n\nMore jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n\n", "frontpage": false}
