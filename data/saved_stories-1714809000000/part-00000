What if we don\u2019t choose\neither?\n\n#### Paris Marx\n\nMay 2, 2024 \u2014 11 min read\n\nUndersea internet cables. Source: Twitter/@tylermorganwall\n\nIn August 2020, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo launched his plan for the\n\u201cClean Network.\u201d The State Department envisioned creating an alliance of\n\u201cclean\u201d countries and companies that would follow the United States in its aim\nto constrain the growth and competitiveness of the Chinese tech sector. They\nwould exclude Chinese components from their telecom networks, ban the sale of\ndevices from Chinese brands, and even start blocking their citizens\u2019 access to\nChinese apps and services.\n\nOnce Joe Biden took power the following year, his administration ditched the\nracist name of the initiative, but kept the main thrust of what it was trying\nto achieve. Gone were the days when the internet was supposed to be open and\nwhatever form it took had to be embraced by countries, companies, and users\nalike, lest they be accused of suppressing digital rights or opposing free\nspeech. As the United States saw its tech industry facing real competition, it\nwas reacting; not by embracing the free market principles it had pushed on\neveryone else, but by trying to corral its allies into a new bloc that would\nagree to remain under the boot of Silicon Valley to forward the United States\u2019\ngeopolitical aim of thwarting the rise of the Chinese tech companies.\n\nIn essence, the US approach told the world it needed to choose: either you\u2019re\npart of the \u201cclean\u201d world of democratic US technology or the \u201cdirty\u201d and\ndangerous alternative marked by the authoritarian tech of China. Forget that\nwhatever side you\u2019re on, companies are looking for the optimal way of\nextracting the most profit from you by harvesting your data, locking you into\ntheir walled gardens, and limiting your actual power over the technology you\nuse. An initiative to protect the market power of Silicon Valley was\nrepositioned as being about defending Western democracy and liberal values \u2014\npart of the usual US playbook.\n\nBut that\u2019s a pretty terrible choice to have to make. Why should we have to\nchoose between Amazon and Alibaba or Google and Baidu \u2014 especially the vast\nmajority of the world that is neither American nor Chinese? Accepting that\nbinary is not the road to a better future of technology or for our societies\nmore broadly, as that trajectory is defined by an exploitative vision for what\ndigital technology must be to maximize power and profit. As US technological\nhegemony declines, the better path is to reject the choice it\u2019s trying to\nforce on the world and forge a new one centered around entirely different\nvalues.\n\n## Sign up for Disconnect\n\nTech critic Paris Marx provides the critical take on Silicon Valley you\u2019ve\nbeen missing\n\nNo spam. Unsubscribe anytime.\n\n## Rejecting the US-China binary\n\nFor years, internet advocates have warned against restrictive policies by\ngovernments like those in China and Russia aimed at limiting access to\nspecific content online. They said initiatives like the Great Firewall risked\nushering in an internet that was increasingly balkanized into different\nspheres where users will have very different experiences of the web based on\nwhere they are. The \u201csplinternet,\u201d as some call it, was to be avoided at all\ncosts, but maybe it\u2019s time to reconsider that stance; maybe it\u2019s time to\nembrace it.\n\nThe open internet as we once knew it was always a product of US hegemony. As\nthe network went global, cloaked in narratives of free speech and democracy,\nUS tech companies rode the wave to establish themselves in international\nmarkets before domestic competitors could effectively compete, then got US\ndiplomatic support to ensure they wouldn\u2019t be strictly regulated. As Senator\nAl Gore declared to the US Senate in 1989, \u201cthe nation which most completely\nassimilates high-performance computing into its economy will very likely\nemerge as the dominant intellectual, economic, and technological force in the\nnext century.\u201d A few years later, he would become vice president and advance\nthe commercialization and eventually privatization of the internet.\n\nThe TikTok ban is all about preserving US power\n\nThe platform isn\u2019t a national security threat, but a challenge to Silicon\nValley\u2019s dominance\n\nDisconnectParis Marx\n\nThe consequences of that policy are now being felt, and even US allies are\nbecoming openly frustrated with how Silicon Valley firms now dominate\nsignificant parts of their economies and they\u2019re limited in how they can\nrespond without drawing the ire of the United States. Part of the reason China\nhas been able to buck the trend and develop a tech industry that can rival\nSilicon Valley is precisely because it didn\u2019t accept the US rulebook. While\nthe Great Firewall does have a strong censorship component, at its core it\u2019s a\ntried-and-true economic policy: by keeping out foreign competition, it gave\nits domestic tech companies the space to grow and improve their capacities to\nthe point where they can go global like their US counterparts. It\u2019s similar to\nwhat South Korea and Japan did decades ago to build up their electronics and\nautomotive industries \u2014 though they did it with US permission.\n\nAs the United States turns to protectionism and an embrace of the kind of\npolicies it would\u2019ve spurned less than a decade ago, the true nature of its\ninternet policy is being put on full display. It was never about the liberal\nideals it wrapped the internet in, but was always about maximizing the power\nof its tech firms and the benefits the US state could accrue from them.\nDespite Silicon Valley\u2019s libertarian rhetoric, there was a mutual benefit\namong tech leaders and the US government to see Silicon Valley go global,\nincluding everything from economic gains to the intelligence benefits enabled\nby its vast surveillance apparatus. In recent years, that\u2019s become openly\nformalized as Silicon Valley has used (and arguably campaigned to advance) the\nhysteria against Chinese tech to forge closer alliances with the US defense\nindustry and security state.\n\nSeen through this light, the binary choice the United States is trying to\nforce onto the world isn\u2019t a particularly appealing one \u2014 not for US citizens,\nand especially not for those of other nationalities where governments have\neven less power to hold US tech companies accountable. An alternative to what\nthe United States is offering doesn\u2019t mean simply embracing Chinese tech or\nbuilding national champions that still follow the same extractive model\nguiding the development of both, but wholly challenging the dynamics that have\nshaped the growth of the global tech industry for the past several decades.\n\n## A proposal for a collective splinternet\n\nIf we\u2019re make a serious case for a splinternet, the central plank should be\nthe elimination of massive global platforms like we\u2019ve gotten used to over the\npast couple decades. Governments will have to use regulatory and legal tools\nto erode the power and influence of those firms, squeezing their business\nmodels by restricting the ways they can use and collect data and enforcing\nmuch stronger rules on their operations. Higher taxes wouldn\u2019t hurt either \u2014\nsomething the US has been holding up globally for years. Regulation of global\nfirms can be hard when undertaken by a single state on the national level,\nwhich is why it\u2019s so important to start building an alliance of states that\nrefuse the binary choice being offered by the United States \u2014 and rein in both\nUS and Chinese tech giants with sectoral rules.\n\nAt the same time as regulatory pressures escalate, governments will need to\nthink about what alternatives look like. This is where forced interoperability\nand open protocols come in, as long as they\u2019re paired with regulatory measures\nand efforts to build public technology. Users will still want to communicate\nand share things with people they know from around the globe, and they should\nstill be able to do that. But access to those federated services should\ninstead happen through platforms conceived of and developed on the regional,\nnational, or even local level. That will allow governments and communities to\nexert much more power over how they work and what they deem acceptable on them\n\u2014 instead of leaving it to a global monopoly or a tech-savvy group that has\ntechnical skill few other people hold \u2014 and given the different rules and\ncultural contexts of different countries, the choices they make may differ.\n\nFor example, we\u2019re already seeing a growing effort to regulate social media as\ngovernments acknowledge the consequences of the previous hands-off approach.\nSome might see that as curbing fundamental rights, particularly US internet\nadvocates and foreign activists who\u2019ve picked up their conception of free\nspeech. But many countries do not have the same approach to free expression\nand tolerate greater enforcement. In Brazil, lawmakers want Twitter to respect\nits ruling to suspend far-right users involved in an attempted coup, while\nAustralia wants it to take down videos of a recent stabbing at a church. Elon\nMusk has been resisting both, using \u201cfree speech\u201d as a justification to\nprotect right-wing accounts. The Australian case, in particular, will be an\nimportant test of the power of national governments outside the United States\nto regulate tech platforms. It wants the stabbing videos removed entirely, not\njust hidden from Australian users.\n\nElon Musk is using Twitter to defend Brazil\u2019s fascists\n\nThe fight shows countries will no longer put up with the drawbacks of\nunregulated social media\n\nDisconnectParis Marx\n\nDeveloping those alternative platforms shouldn\u2019t just be left to private\ncompanies. In the same way many countries have always recognized an important\nrole for public broadcasters, it\u2019s time to reject the neoliberal consensus\nthat\u2019s dominated the internet and create public bodies whose job it is to\ndevelop technology in the public interest \u2014 not to serve founders or\nshareholders. The most exciting proposal I\u2019ve seen in this vein is the British\nDigital Cooperative that Dan Hind conceived of in 2019. In his vision, a\npublic cooperative would be established to build not just a public social\nmedia platform, but non-profit alternatives for payment processing, office\nsoftware, and other digital services people depend on to cut out the rentiers.\nIt wouldn\u2019t just have a central office in the capital city, but would set up\ncenters \u2014 something like libraries, maybe even connected to them \u2014 throughout\nthe country to provide access to technology and public education, while\nbuilding software and services to meet the needs of their communities.\n\nBuilding on Hind\u2019s vision, the social media platform could be connected to\nthat federated network, so it aligns with the values of the country or\ncommunity that builds it, but other jurisdictions can have their cooperatives\nshape their platform to align with their needs \u2014 while still being able to\ncommunicate with everyone else connected to the service. There\u2019s also the\npossibility of setting up alliances between cooperatives on bigger projects\nlike office software and any number of wider technological initiatives to pool\nresources for the collective good, whether domestically or internationally.\n\nInternationalism would have to be a key part of this movement as well \u2014 not\nsimply developing a new model that a small number of countries uses to extract\neconomic returns from others, as is currently the case. In 2020, Juan Ortiz\nFreuler called for a digital non-aligned movement of countries in the Global\nSouth who could chart a different technological path, taking inspiration from\nthe countries that rejected the pressure to embrace US capitalism and Soviet\nCommunism during the Cold War. Given that some countries will have more\nresources, their work should be shared with \u2014 not sold to \u2014 countries with\nfewer resources as their public cooperatives deploy services that meet the\nneeds of their citizens. Countries in this alliance could also share learnings\nfrom the successes and failures of their regulatory efforts to develop more\neffective means of reining in the existing tech monopolists.\n\nNot all of that work will be able to happen on the local or national level\nthough; there will need to be some degree of international governance given\ncommunications infrastructure does cross borders and exists within\ninternational waters. Inspiration could be taken from the Universal Postal\nUnion, a UN agency that\u2019s been around since 1874 to manage the global postal\nsystem and regulate international postage rates. A Universal Internet Union\ncould manage the network of undersea cables that connect the world, instead of\nleaving it to private companies (and increasingly tech monopolists), and the\ntransfer of public technologies and software for the common good. This would\nbe a very different conception for how we govern the internet and the\ndevelopment of digital technology \u2014 but that\u2019s exactly what we need right now.\n\n## Take back control of technology\n\nEmbracing the splinternet won\u2019t be without its challenges. Surely, tech\nlibertarians whose narratives have shaped how people understand the internet\nsince its commercialization will find a slew of problems with any plan to\nincrease the role of government \u2014 even as many of them continue not to\nacknowledge the role their ideas played in enabling the corporate takeover of\nthe internet and the many problems that followed. The bigger issue comes down\nto incentives and economics though.\n\nThe tech policy of many of our governments is currently guided by maximizing\neconomic returns. Even when they talk about reining in the tech monopolies,\nthey\u2019re usually still hesitant to challenge the deeper model that drives the\nindustry because of all the money tech firms can pull in. Europe has been\nlauded for its tech regulation in recent years, but much of it has been\nfocused on putting restrictions on US tech firms so it can raise its own\nexploitative national champions that may go on to command massive valuations\nof their own \u2014 not to challenge the underlying model. But rejecting the binary\nchoice offered by the United States and embracing an alternative will require\njust that: to sacrifice economic returns in favor of democratic control and\nsocial gains.\n\nOne of the great things about such a model is how it could wrest the\ncentralization of technological development from Silicon Valley and a small\nnumber of other hubs around the world to make it something much more\ndemocratic and aligned with public and community needs rather than the\ninterests of venture capitalists and the stock market. In the same way that\nmany countries have domestic media industries \u2014 often supported by public\nfunding \u2014 a collective splinternet allows us to imagine a world where US tech\nmonopolies are pushed out so local innovation can become a tangible goal in a\nway it hasn\u2019t since Silicon Valley\u2019s global conquest.\n\nIs the splinternet a perfect proposal? I\u2019m sure it has its flaws. But Silicon\nValley has had too much power over how we think about and relate to technology\nfor too long, and simply giving Shenzhen a greater hand in it isn\u2019t the path\nforward. The US-China tech rivalry offers a rare opportunity for us to look\nclearly at the technological reality we\u2019ve been sold and to refuse the bargain\nbeing put on the table. Instead, an alliance can be formed that imagines a\nvery different social and technological future that tells US tech billionaires\nto get lost, gives countries greater sovereignty over the technological\nchoices they make, and promotes a much more distributed approach to\ninnovation.\n\nThree decades into the commercialized internet, it\u2019s time to take back\ncontrol.\n\n## Sign up for Disconnect\n\nTech critic Paris Marx provides the critical take on Silicon Valley you\u2019ve\nbeen missing\n\nNo spam.
