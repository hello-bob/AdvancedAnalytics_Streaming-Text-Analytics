Vaughan-Nichols on April 17, 2024\n\nThe XZ attack wasn\u2019t the first, nor will it be the last.\n\nLinux dodged a bullet the other day. If the XZ exploit had gone undiscovered\nfor only a few more weeks, millions of Linux systems would have been\ncompromised with a backdoor. We were lucky. But, can we stay lucky? The Open\nSource Security Foundation (OpenSF) and the OpenJS Foundation revealed that a\nsimilar hackling attempt had targeted several JavaScript programs.\n\nJust like with XZ, a few people \u201cimplored OpenJS to take action to update one\nof its popular JavaScript projects to address any critical vulnerabilities,\nyet cited no specifics.\u201d They wanted OpenJS to designate them as new project\nmaintainers despite having little prior involvement.\n\nOK, that was never going to happen.\n\nJia Tan, the mysterious hacker who became a top XZ programmer and maintainer,\nbefore inserting a backdoor in the code, had spent years building up his\nproject credibility before making his move.\n\nSponsorships Available\n\nSponsorships Available\n\nSponsorships Available\n\nStill, Robin Bender Ginn, Executive Director of OpenJS, and Omkhar\nArasaratnam, General Manager of the OpenSSF, warn we\u2019ll see more of these\nkinds of social engineering attacks. In them, the friendly attacker seeks to\nexploit \u201cthe sense of duty that maintainers have with their project and\ncommunity in order to manipulate them.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, they warn against pull requests containing blobs as artifacts.\nFor example, they point out that the XZ backdoor included a cleverly crafted\nfile in the test suite that wasn\u2019t human-readable.\n\nDubious source code may also be intentionally obfuscated or difficult to\nunderstand. For example, the XZ issue started off with a relatively innocuous\nreplacement of safe_fprintf() with fprintf() to see if anyone would notice. No\none did.\n\nThe question now is: Are such attacks already ongoing? Or, far worse, have\nthey already been made, and they weren\u2019t spotted? Chris Hughes, chief security\nadvisor at Endor Labs, told me, he \u201csuspects that many of these are already\nunderway and may have already been successful but haven\u2019t been exposed or\nidentified yet.\u201d\n\nHow? Hughes explained, \u201cMost open source projects are incredibly underfunded\nand run by a single or small group of maintainers, so utilizing social\nengineering attacks on them isn\u2019t surprising, and given the pressures\nmaintainers are under, they will likely welcome the help. If done well by the\nattackers, it may be difficult for the maintainers to determine which\ninvolvement is from those interested in collaborating and contributing to\nprojects versus those with malicious intent.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not wrong.\n\nAs Jim Zemlin, the Linux Foundation\u2018s Executive Director, sat at Open Source\nSummit North America in Seattle, we\u2019ve been making progress with security,\nbut: \u201ctrust is something we need to talk more about.\u201d We need to answer the\nquestion: \u201cWho writes all this software? This is different from a security\nquestion. Security is \u2018Is there a vulnerability?\u2019 Who is more of a trust\nquestion? Do we trust this identity? Enough to give them a maintainer role?\u201d\n\nBad news, folks. Zemlin admitted we don\u2019t have a good solution to this problem\n\nIndeed, we\u2019ve seen such attempts before. In 2021, for example, researchers at\nthe University of Minnesota tried to insert vulnerabilities in the Linux\nkernel to see if it could be done. Spoiler alert: They failed and were banned\nfrom the Linux kernel.\n\nBut, don\u2019t get comfortable. The Linux kernel has a large team of passionate,\nbrilliant maintainers. Few projects are so lucky.\n\nDan Lorenc, founder and CEO of the security company Chainguard, put it well.\n\u201cProjects get stale, maintainership changes, and there are a lot of\nconsiderations to keep in mind when granting someone new commit access to a\ncritical project. There\u2019s no single right way to do this, but cataloging best\npractices with the community would go a long way to helping prevent this in\nthe future.\u201d\n\nWhat are the trust best practices? We honestly don\u2019t know yet. But, if we\u2019re\nto trust our open source projects, we must figure it out.\n\nTwitterLinkedInFacebookRedditEmailShare\n\nTwitterLinkedInFacebookRedditEmailShare\n\nFiled Under: Blogs, IT Security, Social - Facebook, Social - LinkedIn, Social\n- X Tagged With: Linux Foundation, open source threats, OpenSSF\n\n\u00ab Auto Reply\n\n#### Techstrong TV\n\nClick full-screen to enable volume control\n\nWatch latest episodes and shows\n\n#### Upcoming Webinars\n\nThursday, April 25, 2024 - 1:00 pm EDT\n\nThursday, April 25, 2024 - 3:00 pm EDT\n\nTuesday, April 30, 2024 - 10:00 am EDT\n\n#### Podcast\n\nDevOps.com \u00b7 DevOps Platform Debate, Copilot Alternative and Did your AI lose\nits mind\n\n#### DevOps Unbound Podcast\n\n#### Press Releases\n\n#### Zama Raises $73M in Series A Led by Multicoin Capital and Protocol Labs\nto Commercialize Fully Homomorphic Encryption\n\n#### ThreatHunter.ai Halts Hundreds of Attacks in the past 48 hours: Combating\nRansomware and Nation-State Cyber Threats Head-On\n\n#### Aembit Announces New Workload IAM Integration with CrowdStrike to Help\nEnterprises Secure Workload-to-Workload Access\n\n#### Control D Launches Control D for Organizations: Democratizing\nCybersecurity for Organizations of All Sizes\n\n#### Deloitte Partners with Memcyco to Combat ATO and Other Online Attacks\nwith Real-Time Digital Impersonation Protection Solutions\n\n#### Quiz\n\nResults to last week\u2019s quiz are here.\n\n#### GET THE TOP STORIES OF THE WEEK\n\n#### Sponsored Content\n\n## Why AIOps is Critical for Networks\n\nOctober 3, 2023 | Mitch Ashley\n\n## JFrog\u2019s swampUP 2023: Ready for Next\n\nSeptember 1, 2023 | Natan Solomon\n\n## DevOps World: Time to Bring the Community Together Again\n\nAugust 8, 2023 | Saskia Sawyerr\n\n## PlatformCon 2023: This Year\u2019s Hottest Platform Engineering Event\n\nMay 30, 2023 | Karolina Jun\u010dyt\u0117\n\n## The Google Cloud DevOps Awards: Apply Now!\n\nJanuary 10, 2023 | Brenna Washington\n\n\u00a9 2024 \u00b7Techstrong Group, Inc.All rights reserved.\n\n\u2713\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\nAddToAny\n\nMore...\n\n# DevOps.com asks for your consent to use your personal data to:\n\n  * perm_identity\n\nPersonalised advertising and content, advertising and content measurement,\naudience research and services development\n\n  * devices\n\nStore and/or access information on a device\n\n  * How can I change my choice?\n\n  * What if I don't consent?\n\n  * How does legitimate interest work?\n\n  * Do I have to consent to everything?\n\nYour personal data will be processed and information from your device\n(cookies, unique identifiers, and other device data) may be stored by,\naccessed by and shared with 136 TCF vendor(s) and 63 ad partner(s), or used\nspecifically by this site or app.\n\nSome vendors may process your personal data on the basis of legitimate\ninterest, which you can object to by managing your options below.
