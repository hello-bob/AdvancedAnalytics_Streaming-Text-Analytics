Why is this, and and how can I rewire my ravenous brain?\n\nLiz Hoggard 4 May 2024 \u2022 11:00am\n\nRelated Topics\n\n  * Dieting,\n  * Weight gain,\n  * Weight loss\n\nThis feature is available for registered users.

Or do\nour brains work differently when it comes to appetite regulation?\n\nI only had breakfast two hours ago, and I\u2019m starving. It\u2019s humiliating to feel\nso out of control. It doesn\u2019t help that my partner, Mike, has a fear of being\nfull and is extremely disciplined. He\u2019ll skip the starter if it will spoil his\nmain course and often misses lunch altogether.\n\nWe\u2019re like the comedy version of Jack Sprat and his wife. He eats very little\nfat; I eat no lean. And it\u2019s always me licking the platter clean.\n\nLike many emotional overeaters, I exercise a lot \u2013 but food is my driver. I\nwork from home, so treats become a way of dealing with tricky work calls. I\ncook from scratch, but the fridge is two minutes away.\n\nSo, do some people just feel hungry all the time? Are we self-sabotaging? Or\ndo our brains work differently when it comes to appetite regulation?\n\nMost of us don\u2019t understand the difference between fullness and satiation,\nexplains the clinical psychologist Dr Helen McCarthy, who specialises in\nappetite retraining.\n\n\u201cFullness is the physical sensation you get towards the end of the meal, after\nyou\u2019ve eaten an increasing amount of food. Satiation relates to how long you\nare satisfied before you want to start eating next. So satiation definitely\nrelates to what food you\u2019ve eaten. Stomach stretching is registered by\nmechanoreceptors in the stomach wall, and as these are nerve fibres, this\ninformation is registered by the brain pretty much immediately.\n\n\u201cHow full you are immediately after eating a meal relates to the volume of\nwhat you have eaten. If you eat the same volume of Coco Pops and falafels, by\nthe end the degree of fullness will be the same, because your stomach has\nstretched the same amount with the two meals. But the two foods are processed\nand digested differently, and you\u2019ll be hungry again quicker after the Coco\nPops.\u201d\n\nBut when Mike and I eat the same meal, why does he feel full more quickly and\nstay satiated for longer?\n\nWhen I talk to the nutritional therapist Stephanie Moore, she explains that\nwhen stress receptors in the stomach encounter a volume of food, production of\nthe hunger hormone ghrelin is suppressed. So Mike clearly has a very sensitive\nresponse. Soon, he\u2019s done.\n\n## \u2018An overstretched stomach is like an inflated balloon\u2019\n\nMoore explains that I am less sensitive, or have stopped listening to the\nhormonal message of ghrelin, and override it. \u201cYou\u2019re over-stretching. And\nover time, that messaging gets weaker. Because it\u2019s like an inflated balloon,\nevery time you let it down, it wrinkles and never goes back to normal size\nagain.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all about our hormones functioning properly, she explains. \u201cIn addition\nto ghrelin, there\u2019s leptin, GLP-1, insulin and thyroid hormones. All have a\nfundamental effect on when you feel hungry, what foods you\u2019ll want to eat, and\nhow strong that message is to stop eating.\n\n\u201cThe irony is the food that gives us a momentary hit is almost always\ndetrimental to our gut microbes, even though our gut microbes are programming\nmany of these hormonal responses.\u201d\n\n## Why we become \u2018volume eaters\u2019\n\nFor many people, of course, overeating has less to do with hunger and\neverything to do with distraction, comfort, swallowing of feelings, or just\nbeing a bit bored. \u201cWe are chemically shifting how we feel because we want to\nchange our state.\n\n\u201cVarious foods and textures give us a dopamine reward when we feel p----d off.\nWe get a high from sugar. Gluten, a protein in wheat, releases certain\ncompounds that are very much like morphine. And casein, a protein in dairy,\nhas opioid-like properties.\u201d\n\nOh heavens. I am a secret drug addict. Clearly an intervention is needed. So\non behalf of \u201cvolume eaters\u201d everywhere (the new buzz word for greedy types),\nI spend a week talking to the experts about the science of hunger and satiety,\nfinding out what my body really needs and trying out their suggestions.\n\nIf feeling more hungry than other people is a combination of genetics,\nlifestyle factors and what we\u2019re actually eating, can those of us with\nappetites like Labradors really train ourselves to be less hungry? If it is a\nhabit of a lifetime, how can we break it at this late stage?\n\nOver a week I hear about \u201cfood noise\u201d and \u201curge surfing\u201d and \u201cbliss points\u201d as\nI try to do the food maths. This is what I learnt.\n\n## Sometimes the message to stop eating doesn\u2019t reach the brain\n\nWhen your stomach is empty, it contracts, sending signals to the brain,\ntelling you to eat. Your stomach rumbles, blood sugar levels dip (triggering\nthe release of cortisol and adrenalin, so you might get slightly \u201changry\u201d).\n\nGhrelin is the hormone secreted by the stomach that signals you are hungry.\nAfter the body receives food, it will shut down ghrelin and release leptin.\nLeptin signals the brain to stop eating.\n\nBut for some people \u2013 including me \u2013 the bell doesn\u2019t ring and we never\nexperience satiety. This means the message to stop eating doesn\u2019t reach the\nbrain. Dr Giles Yeo MBE, an obesity expert and professor of molecular\nneuroendocrinology at the University of Cambridge, says that never feeling\nproperly full after eating is \u201cnot an innate moral failing, but a hormonal\ndiscrepancy\u201d.\n\nNormally when we eat, our gut hormones go up, making us feel fuller. But in\nsome people the gut hormone levels don\u2019t go high enough, so we eat more. In\nthe past, being hungrier than others was an asset, \u201cmaking you the hunter in\nyour village, more willing to go after the antelope\u201d, says Dr Yeo. But with\ntoday\u2019s sedentary lifestyles and fast food, it\u2019s a disadvantage.\n\n## The brain doesn\u2019t care what we\u2019re eating\n\n\u201cWhen our brain gets what it needs, it\u2019s happy,\u201d says Pauline Cox, a\nfunctional nutritionist and the author of Hungry Woman: Eating for Good\nHealth, Happiness and Hormones.\n\n\u201cBut our brain is a diva. Its main focus is survival. So it doesn\u2019t care what\nwe\u2019re eating, it just needs to eat. If it could talk, it would say: \u2018give me\nthe essential fatty acids and more protein\u2019. But all we hear is, \u2018I need\nfood\u2019, and the smells of the bakery as we walk past shout out to us, spiking\nour dopamine.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re constantly fighting this food environment that is addictive for our\nbrain. So to quieten down its shouting, we need to give it what it needs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rational, educated part of ourselves is easily undermined by our\namygdala, our emotional neediness,\u201d says Moore. \u201cAnd in that moment, when\nyou\u2019re exuberant, happy, sad, whatever, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to be driving your\ndecision to eat, in spite of a much more intellectual part of your brain\nsaying: \u2018Really, is this a good idea? We know better, don\u2019t we?\u2019 A push and\npull goes on all the time.\u201d\n\n## Our body cares about nutrients, not calories\n\n\u201cWe are sabotaged by a food industry that makes food hyper-palatable. So\npeople are overfed, but undernourished,\u201d says Moore.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that we don\u2019t have a calorie sensor in our body, so it has no\nway of knowing how many calories we\u2019ve eaten. It does have exquisite nutrient\nsensors, so if we are eating wholesome, nourishing food, the signal of \u2018I\u2019m\ndone, you\u2019ve met all my nutritional needs\u2019 is ticked.\n\n\u201cBut eating ultra-processed foods devoid of anything useful means we keep\neating, because there\u2019s no point where the brain goes: \u2018Oh, yes, I\u2019ve hit my\nvitamin E and D quota, thank you.\u2019 Instead it says: \u2018We\u2019ve got the calories.\nBut there\u2019s been nothing good yet. So I\u2019ll keep eating.\u2019\u201d\n\n## Protein can transform your hunger\n\nGetting a good amount of protein in your first meal can be transformative for\nmanaging hunger, advises Cox. It benefits appetite control throughout the\nentire day and has been shown to reduce late-night eating.\n\n\u201cThe building block of protein, amino acids, can reduce cravings and increase\nour sense of satiety. Many people deficient in protein try to fill up on foods\nthat convert quickly into sugar, such as breads and pasta. Eating more high-\nquality protein such as eggs, Greek yogurt, fish, chicken, feta, will help you\nfeel fuller for longer.\u201d\n\nVegetable proteins including chickpeas, beans and peas also keep you\nsatisfied. \u201cIf you\u2019re vegan, upping your protein helps to reduce cravings,\nbecause it gives the brain the amino acids it needs for its serotonin,\ndopamine, but also for all of the tissues of the body.\u201d\n\n\u201cResearch has shown that protein has the strongest signal of being well fed.\nIt is incredibly easy to eat 300 calories of crisps, or snack food, and much\nless easy to eat 300 calories of steak.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same calories, but an entirely different hormonal response. So if\nyou want your body to understand you\u2019ve eaten enough, you need to be protein-\ncentric,\u201d says Moore. So goodbye toast, hello mushroom omelette.\n\n## How manufacturers aim for the \u2018bliss point\u2019\n\n\u201cWe evolved to survive unpredictable food supply, but many of us now live in\nan environment where there\u2019s an oversupply, but biologically, we\u2019re still\nancient,\u201d says Dr McCarthy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got that inbuilt biology of storing fat and behaviourally being\nattracted to sweeter, fatty foods. We have cravings for particular\ncombinations and those are the ones that have been manufactured to perfection.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018bliss point\u2019 is a term coined by food scientist Howard Moskowitz to\ndescribe the perfect combination of sugar, salt, and fat that makes us crave\nmore of a certain food. Food technologists develop and engineer particular\ncombinations of flavours and textures, then do rigorous market testing to see\nwhich things consumers find the most palatable or moreish.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got this enormous pressure pushing us towards consumption. As a result,\nwhat we\u2019re consuming is calorie-dense, energy-dense foods that aren\u2019t\nnecessarily very nutrient-dense. So we\u2019re driven to keep eating.\u201d\n\n## If you eat too much, you might need more sleep\n\nSleep deprivation can cause an elevation in ghrelin. \u201cAn increase of 15 per\ncent in our hunger hormone and a reduction of 15 per cent in satiety hormone\nis seen with poor sleep,\u201d says Cox.\n\n## Chew more, eat less and never in the car\n\n\u201cPeople who chew more eat less calories,\u201d says Dr Megan Rossi from The Gut\nHealth Clinic. \u201cFood sits in your stomach for longer, a residue may stay in\nyour mouth, activating the different hormones so you feel more satisfied.\u201d\n\n\u201cSlowing down allows time for hormonal signals to kick in, telling you you\u2019re\nfull, or for you to tire of eating,\u201d says Moore. One of her pet peeves is\npeople eating in the car. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to overeat when you\u2019re not paying\nattention.\u201d\n\n## Don\u2019t ban any food\n\n\u201cA technique I find helpful with clients is rather than saying \u2018never again\u2019,\nwhich can be overwhelming for someone who feels reliant on highly palatable,\naddictive foods, is to say: \u2018just not today\u2019,\u201d says Cox.\n\n\u201cAnd the more of those \u2018just not today\u2019 decisions you make, it snowballs and\nyour dopamine pathways become sensitised again. You find pleasure in the umami\nflavours, saltiness, natural sweetness in blueberries and strawberries. Foods\nwe\u2019ve lost interest in taste incredible, our palate literally changes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways think about what you can add to your meal rather than what you can\ntake away,\u201d says Abigail Green, a nutritionist at Nuffield Health.\n\n\u201cAdd more nourishing things to a snack so it looks like a mini meal. If you\nwant crisps, go for it, but add veg sticks or fruit. If you combine foods,\nthere is more satiety, particularly if you have protein and fibre and healthy\nfats.\u201d\n\n## Fibre, fibre, fibre\n\n\u201cDietary fibre slows down digestion of the food in the gut, which activates\nthe fullness hormones more quickly. Fibre also feeds the gut bacteria in the\nlower part of the intestine, and produces chemicals called short-chain fatty\nacids, which help to regulate our appetite hormones,\u201d says Dr Rossi.\n\nSoon I\u2019m adding milled flax seeds to meals, eating potato with the skin on, as\nwell as opting for beans and lentils over grains. Gritty, but filling.\n\nMeanwhile, a new clinical trial by science and nutrition company Zoe has found\na huge reduction in hunger for 88.6 per cent of participants who followed the\nZoe method, as well as weight loss and reduced waist circumference. \u201cWe know\nthat a fibre-rich diet and lots of whole plants, nuts, seeds and legumes is\nwhat stimulates the production of hormones in the gut that make us feel full.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re called satiety hormones, things like GLP-1, which is what Ozempic\nmimics, except you can make them yourself through diet,\u201d says Dr Federica\nAmati, Zoe\u2019s head of nutrition.\n\nI find it empowering that our body can make its own weight-loss drug.\n\nWhen the gut microbes have enough fibre to break down, they produce chemicals\nthat tell the endocrine cells to produce hormones in the gut. These get sent\nto the brain to tell it we\u2019re full. She recommends I cook a lentil daal with\nspinach, carrots and onions. \u201cYou get a vast amount of micronutrients and\nphytonutrients and polyphenols for a relatively small amount of energy.\u201d\n\n## Don\u2019t fear fat\n\nAs a child of the 1970s I was brought up to avoid butter and full-fat milk.\nBut it has a slower digestion rate, and sits in your stomach for longer,\nactivating the stretch receptors. \u201cThey are called intelligent fats for good\nreason. They\u2019re needed for the structure of our brain,\u201d says Pauline Cox.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re low in essential fatty acids, not only do we have this persistent\nhunger even if we\u2019re eating all the time, but we suffer with our mood and\nmental clarity. You\u2019ll find Omega-3s in flax, chia seeds, walnuts. Oily fish\ncan really help with cravings. Or there is ahiflower, a plant-based\nalternative grown regeneratively in the UK, sold in a supplement form called\nRegenerative Omegas.\u201d\n\n## Eat dessert straight after a salad\n\nAs we get older, our insulin works less well. For women in menopause, hunger\nlevels often go through the roof, explains Cox. \u201cInsulin is a crucial hormone\nfor transporting glucose from the bloodstream after we eat and into the brain\ncells.\n\n\u201cHowever, high sugar consumption over a long period of time results in insulin\nno longer being able to open the door to allow glucose into the cells. If the\nhypothalamus (part of the brain responsible for hunger) becomes insulin-\nresistant, we can lose our sense of feeling full, driving us to want to eat\nmore to satisfy the brain\u2019s need for glucose.\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re thinking: \u2018I only ate an hour ago.\u2019\u201d Eating fibre alongside foods\nwith a higher glycemic index (sugar load), will lower the impact on our blood\nsugars. \u201cA large salad with your pizza reduces the blood sugar spike from\npizza. Eating dessert immediately after a fibre-packed lunch lowers the blood\nsugar impact of the dessert.\u201d\n\nShe also recommends intermittent fasting to improve insulin sensitivity. \u201cWhen\nyou stop eating for certain periods of time, your body turns to its own\nreserve of fuel in the way of fat.\n\n\u201cAnd when we burn fat, we release ketones, these amazing compounds that push\nthemselves into the brain cells. When our glucose fuel system goes a bit awry,\nketones can be really helpful.\u201d\n\n## Reshape what fullness feels like\n\n\u201cWe give people a scale of hunger from zero to 10,\u201d says Dr Rossi. \u201cHalfway\nthrough your meal, assess where you\u2019re at. Do the same at three quarters\nthrough, and you shouldn\u2019t go over eight out of 10 for satiety.\n\n\u201cReshaping what fullness is is really helpful for people who eat until they\nfeel uncomfortable,\u201d says Dr David Creel, a psychologist and registered\ndietitian, and author of A Size That Fits: Lose Weight and Keep it off, One\nThought at a Time.\n\n## The verdict on avocados\n\nIf you crave avocado, which is a nutrient-dense but also calorie-dense food,\nhave a quarter and bulk it up with nutrient-dense but low-calorie foods like\nstir-fry vegetables and legumes.\n\nIt\u2019s important that volume eaters do have some of these calorie-dense,\nnutrient-rich foods, because they feed the gut microbiome. \u201cWe need to have\nthat wide variety of plant diversity, because those more prone to obesity seem\nto miss bacterial diversity,\u201d says Dr Rossi.\n\n## Try \u2018urge surfing\u2019\n\n\u201cHunger has a bad rap,\u201d says Dr McCarthy. \u201cBut if you learn to tolerate mild\nlevels of hunger, it\u2019s a massively helpful skill if you want to lose weight,\nbecause you\u2019re doing that little bit of fat-burning between meals.\n\n\u201cAnd while you\u2019re not digesting food, your body can switch to other processes\nlike cell repair and gut cleaning. And the more hungry you get, the greater\nthe sharpness of your taste perception is. When you\u2019re not hungry, your taste\nperception is dulled.\u201d\n\nDr Creel calls it \u201curge surfing\u201d, sitting with the cravings but not giving in.\nMaybe light a candle, put on some classical music. \u201cWhen you\u2019re home, don\u2019t\ncook dinner immediately. Read for 20 minutes, have a shower. Break the\nroutine,\u201d advises Abigail Green.\n\n## The search for dopamine\n\n\u201cActivities such as sex and eating stimulate the release of the\nneurotransmitter or brain hormone dopamine,\u201d says Cox.\n\nIf we\u2019re feeling low, or stressed, we can push our emotions down through\neating, and it gives us that dopamine spike, which makes us feel good\ntemporarily.\n\nThe problem with dopamine, as with alcohol, drugs, gambling and porn\naddiction, is the high is succeeded by a drop, driving us to eat more sugar to\nmaintain the high. Food manufacturers understand this. Which is why pasta\nsauce and breads have hidden added sugars, because that spike is going to\ndrive you to want more.\u201d\n\n## Hard food is better than soft food\n\n\u201cFoods higher in fibre require chewing rather than just drinking our\ncalories,\u201d says Dr Creel. People who eat foods with more complex textures eat\nsignificantly less food during the meal overall, as there is time for the\nfullness signal to reach the brain.\n\nSo a lunch of hard foods (white rice, raw vegetables) is better than a soft\nlunch (risotto). \u201cHow the food is delivered \u2013 an apple versus apple sauce\nversus apple juice \u2013 can make a real difference.\u201d\n\n## What to eat when it\u2019s late\n\nI\u2019m out late most nights at the theatre. What do I eat to silence those hunger\npangs and still sleep? Dr Rossi recommends a handful of nuts or steamed veg\nwith garlic and soy sauce.\n\nCox keeps hardboiled eggs in her fridge and eats a couple with high-quality\nsalt.\n\n\u201cBoiled eggs are the simplest fast food, you get every nutrient you need apart\nfrom vitamin C.\u201d I try it one night. Bingo \u2013 I feel satiated, and I\u2019m asleep\nan hour later.\n\n## Why we all need to know about the satiety ratio\n\nOne thing I found incredibly helpful was knowing the satiety ratio of foods. A\nscale called the satiety index was developed in a 1995 study by University of\nSydney in Australia.\n\nThe study tested 240-calorie servings of 38 foods, separated into six food\ncategories (fruits, bakery products, snack foods, carbohydrate-rich foods,\nprotein-rich foods, and breakfast cereals with milk).\n\nFoods that are more filling have numbers higher than 100. Foods that are less\nfilling have numbers lower than 100. Protein was found to be more filling than\neither carbohydrates or fats.\n\nFoods rich in fibre also rank high and contain few calories (because fibre is\nnot digested, it provides bulk and helps you feel full longer as it slows down\nemptying of the stomach and digestion time).\n\nCarbohydrates are also good if you exclude sugar and unrefined carbs. Fatty\nfoods are, surprisingly, not filling.\n\nHighly satiating foods tend to have more volume for the same amount of\ncalories; this means they take up more space. They are also generally less\nprocessed. Joyfully, I could have potatoes (so long as you go easy on butter,\ncheese), wholemeal bread and popcorn, which is a whole grain high in fibre\n(but ditch the oil or butter).\n\n## Foods that score lower on the satiety index\n\nIf you really want yogurt, opt for live yogurt that is 50 per cent protein, 50\npercent carbohydrates, says Dr Rossi. If you\u2019re mad about peanuts (as I am),\nswitch to almonds and walnuts. These are energy-dense, nutrient-rich snack\noptions, high in healthy fats and protein.\n\nIllustrations: Jason Ford\n\nRecommended\n\n## Seven easy ways to beat the 'fat gene'\n\nRead more\n\nRelated Topics\n\n  * Dieting,\n  * Weight gain,\n  * Weight loss\n\n21\n\nLicense this content\n\n## Comments\n\nThe Telegraph values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic,\nconstructive and respectful.
