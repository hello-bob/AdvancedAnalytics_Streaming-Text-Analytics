Our protocol's name is Sisu whose architecture is based on\n> distributed Virgo in zkBridge with some major improvements. Besides proving\n> signature aggregation, we provide solutions to 2 hard problems in proving\n> Ethereum full node: 1) any public key is valid under previous beacon state\n> and 2) all public keys are pairwise distinct. Our solution does not require\n> worker-to-worker communication and therefore reduce total worker-to-worker\n> network traffic from terabyte of data to zero compared to zkBridge. This\n> makes our approach suitable for emerging distributed prover markets and more\n> decentralized compared to zkBridge. Our design is highly parallelable and\n> capable of running on GPU for most parts.\n\nSubjects:| Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.10404 [cs.CR]  \n(or arXiv:2404.10404v2 [cs.CR] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.10404arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Billy Pham [view email] [v1] Tue, 16 Apr 2024 09:09:58 UTC (153 KB) [v2]\nWed, 17 Apr 2024 05:42:14 UTC (153 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Sisu: Decentralized Trustless Bridge For Full\nEthereum Node, by Billy Pham and 1 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CR\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
