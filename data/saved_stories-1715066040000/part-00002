Does that mean you can stop taking it?\n\nMillions of Americans who have used new obesity drugs like Wegovy to lose\nweight and improve health are wondering what happens if they stop taking them\n\nByJONEL ALECCIA AP health writer\n\nMay 1, 2024, 4:49 PM\n\n1:11\n\nFILE - Donna Cooper holds up a dosage of Wegovy, a drug used for w...Show More\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nMillions of Americans who have dropped pounds and boosted their health using\npopular obesity drugs like Wegovy are facing a new dilemma: What happens if\nthey stop taking them?\n\nMany worry that they\u2019ll regain weight and revert to old habits. In studies,\npeople who paused the drugs put back on most of the weight they lost.\n\nBut others are gambling on a do-it-yourself strategy to ease off the drugs and\nstay slim by stretching out doses, taking the medication intermittently or\nstopping and starting again only if needed.\n\nMore than 3 million prescriptions for the new medications are dispensed each\nmonth in the U.S., according to 2023 data from the health technology company\nIQVIA. They include semaglutide, the drug in Ozempic and Wegovy, and\ntirzepatide, the drug in Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\nBut many people don\u2019t stick with it. One study published in the journal\nObesity found that just 40% of patients who filled a prescription for Wegovy\nin 2021 or 2022 were still taking it a year later.\n\nHere's what you need to know about taking a break from these new medications:\n\nDoctors who treat obesity stress that the disease is a chronic condition that\nmust be managed indefinitely, like heart disease or high blood pressure. The\nnew injection drugs work by mimicking hormones in the gut and the brain to\nregulate appetite and feelings of fullness. They were designed \u2014 and tested \u2014\nto be used continuously, experts said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they should be used in intermittent fashion. It\u2019s not approved\nfor that. They don\u2019t work like that,\u201d said Dr. Andres Acosta, an obesity\nresearcher at the Mayo Clinic.\n\nSome people who achieved their health and weight goals with the drugs are\nlooking for an offramp, said Dr. Amy Rothberg, who directs a weight-management\nand diabetes treatment program at the University of Michigan.\n\n\u201cMany of them want to step down or de-escalate their dose,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd\nthey\u2019re also wanting to ultimately discontinue the medication.\u201d\n\nSome patients don\u2019t like side effects such as nausea and constipation. Others\nwant to stop for holidays or special occasions \u2014 or just because they don\u2019t\nwant to take the weekly shots indefinitely, said Dr. Katherine Saunders, an\nobesity expert at Weill Cornell Medicine and co-founder of the obesity\ntreatment company Intellihealth.\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s a help, it\u2019s an aid,\u201d said Donna Cooper of Front Royal, Virginia,\nwho lost nearly 40 pounds (18 kilograms) in nine months using Wegovy along\nwith diet and exercise. \u201cAt some point you have to come off of them. I don\u2019t\nwant to be on them forever.\u201d\n\nOther people have been forced to ration or halt doses because the drugs are\ncostly \u2014 $1,000 to $1,300 per month \u2014 and insurance coverage varies or because\ndemand has far outstripped supply, Rothberg noted.\n\nThe drugs work by changing the way the body processes and stores energy. When\npeople stop taking it, many gain back the weight they lost, plus more. And\nmany report a return of symptoms of obesity such as so-called food noise or\nintrusive thoughts of food, raging hunger and decreased feelings of fullness\nwhen they eat.\n\nSome people who stop the drugs and start again have severe stomach side\neffects. Others find the drugs don't work as well as before. There's no data\non the long-term effects of intermittent use, Saunders said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a strategy that will work for most individuals, but it\ncould be an option for select patients,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the\nHoward Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
