He said: \u201cThey live exclusively\nunderground, and have pale features. It looks very ghostly.\u201d\n\nHe added to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation: \u201cIt\u2019s extremely slender\nand it\u2019s got sharp fangs. That villainous appearance inspired me to name it\nafter a famous villain like Lord Voldemort.\u201d\n\nLeptanilla voldemort is pale and slender with 'sharp fangs' Credit: MARK\nWONG/UWA\n\nThere are other creatures that have been named after Harry Potter characters,\nincluding a wasp named after Lucius Malfoy, the father of Potter\u2019s nemesis,\nand a crab that was named after Severus Snape.\n\nThe new species of ant is highly elusive \u2013 it was only found when scientists\ndrilled an 80ft deep hole into the ground.\n\nAnts from the genus Leptanilla are very rare in Australia. This is only the\nsecond time they have been found.\n\n\u201cWe hardly encounter them, even as experienced myrmecologists, or ant\nscientists,\u201d said Dr Wong.\n\nEach year, hundreds of species of fish, mammals, birds and insects are given\nnames by scientists.\n\nLast year, a snake found by explorers in the mountains of Peru was named after\nHarrison Ford, in recognition of his work as an environmental advocate and\nrole as vice chairman of Conservation International.\n\nIn 2009, a snail found in the tropics of northern Queensland was named Crikey\nsteveirwini, after Steve Irwin, the late crocodile hunter and wildlife\npresenter. Its shell has an overall khaki appearance, which inspired the\nconnection to Irwin.\n\nA tree frog that was discovered in Ecuador in 2008 was named Hyloscirtus\nprincecharlesi after the then Prince Charles, in honour of his work to protect\nrainforests.\n\nA rare species of horse fly found in Queensland was named Scaptia beyonceae,\nafter the singer Beyonce. Bryan Lessard, the scientist who chose the name,\nsaid that it was \u201cthe unique dense golden hairs on the fly\u2019s abdomen that led\nme to name this fly in honour of the performer\u201d.\n\nRelated Topics\n\n  * Animals,\n  * Harry Potter,\n  * Ralph Fiennes,\n  * Ants\n\n7\n\nLicense this content\n\n## Comments\n\nThe Telegraph values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic,\nconstructive and respectful.
