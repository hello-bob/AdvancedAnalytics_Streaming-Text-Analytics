But when people chant 'globalize the intifada' it's\nvery clear,' ISGAP executive director Dr. Charles Small told DailyMail.com.\n\n'What Hamas represents, its ideology, is a commitment to dismantling Israel\nand exterminating Jews around the world.'\n\n  * Copy link to paste in your message\n\nISGAP executive director Dr. Charles Small told DailyMail.com, 'It's being\npresented as a peace movement, that there's Jews involved, that it's not anti-\nsemitic. But when people chant 'globalize the intifada' it's very clear'\n\nThe student groups say they do not promote violence, are inclusive towards\nJewish people, and are exercising a legal right to protest.\n\nThe ISGAP report asserts that SJP has become an effective and well-funded\nnetwork for organizing protests around the country, but that its failure to\nregister as a charity or formal organization left its funding sources and\noperations murky and unregulated.\n\nHints of financial backing could be seen at the Columbia 'Gaza Solidarity\nEncampment', including students erecting several identical high-end tents\ncosting hundreds of dollars each, and handing out free Dunkin' Donuts coffee,\n$12.50 sandwiches from Pret-a-Manger and $10 rotisserie chickens to\nparticipants.\n\nSmall said his think tank, with 'a group of forensic accountants and experts\nin terror financing', have been working to follow the money funneled into\nprotests.\n\nWhat they found was a combined flow of more than $3 million a year going to\ncampus chapters, coming from a constellation of charities, some of which have\nalleged links to Hamas.\n\nThe nonprofits funding SJP include the Westchester People's Action Coalition\n(WESPAC), Tides, American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), its parent organization\nAmericans for Justice in Palestine (AJP), and Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP).\n\nThe ISGAP report said SJP had the closest financial links with WESPAC, which\nacts as a 'financial sponsor' for the organization, routing tax-free donations\nthrough its accounts to SJP chapters.\n\nThe report pointed to small print on a donation page of the SJP website which\nstates that the money 'goes to WESPAC Foundation Inc.'\n\nNew York-based WESPAC's IRS filings for the year to August 2023 list a total\nrevenue of $2,379,650, with expenses of $1,362,449 for 'human rights and\ncurrent affairs education and information provided to many hundreds of people\nthrough public meeting events, conferences and newsletters.'\n\n  * Copy link to paste in your message\n\nHints of financial backing could be seen at the Columbia 'Gaza Solidarity\nEncampment', including students erecting several identical high-end tents\ncosting up to hundreds of dollars each\n\n  * Copy link to paste in your message\n\nColumbia students sustain themselves with $12 croissants, organic grain\ngranola and a variety of vegan and gluten-free homemade goods at the pro-\nPalestine protest encampment on the university's iconic Upper West Side campus\n\n  * Copy link to paste in your message\n\nThe nonprofits funding SJP include the Westchester People's Action Coalition\n(WESPAC).

As Jews who believe in human rights and justice, we demand\nyou do better,' Bazian, who is not Jewish, wrote from his personal account on\nMay 11 last year.\n\nSpeaking on Bazian\u2019s behalf, Jump denied he controlled JVP\u2019s Twitter account.\n\n  * Copy link to paste in your message\n\nOne SJP chapter at New York university Bard even published statements with\nimages of paragliders similar to those used by Hamas terrorists on October 7,\nsaying 'Liberation is a material process that requires confrontation by any\nmeans necessary'\n\n  * Copy link to paste in your message\n\nDr. Small told DailyMail.com that Bazian revealed he controls the JVP Twitter\naccount when he accidentally tweeted CNN anchor Jake Tapper from his personal\naccount rather than the JVP account\n\nJVP's most recent IRS filings for 2022 show it received $3,959,130 in revenue,\nand spent $2,610,183 \u2013 including $1,851,974 on salaries. It is sitting on net\nassets of almost $3.2 million.\n\nBazian, a lecturer in the department of ethnic studies at Berkeley, has a\nhistory of getting into trouble on social media.\n\n  * Copy link to paste in your message\n\nAMP has a 'National Campus Coordinator', Taher Herzallah, who referenced his\nwork with SJP on his Linkedin profile\n\nIn 2017, the Berkeley lecturer shared an image of an Orthodox Jewish man\nsmiling and raising his arms above the caption: 'I can now kill, rape, smuggle\norgans & steal the land of Palestinians.'\n\nBazian apologized for the tweet when questioned by a Jewish newspaper.\n\nSmall told DailyMail.com that he believed the pro-Hamas history of some of\nSJP's backers has bled into the current demonstrations.\n\nThe ISGAP report pointed to 'the rhetoric of [National SJP] shifting from one\nof calling for a ceasefire, to the violence and destruction of Israeli cities\nand people.'\n\nIn the days after the October 7 deadly terror attacks by Hamas, SJP national\nleaders released a 'Day of Resistance Toolkit' which encouraged 'not just\nslogans and rallies, but armed confrontation with oppressors' in Israel.\n\nOne SJP chapter at New York university Bard even published statements with\nimages of paragliders similar to those used by Hamas terrorists on October 7,\nsaying 'Liberation is a material process that requires confrontation by any\nmeans necessary.'\n\nAccording to a report by the Anti-Defamation League, at an April 17 rally at\nColumbia one protester shouted 'We are Hamas' and on April 20 others chanted:\n'Al-Qasam you make us proud, kill another soldier now!' referring to Hamas's\nmilitary wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qasam Brigades.\n\nPhotos circulated on social media showed counter-protesters waving Israeli and\nUS flags and a pro-Palestine student standing in front of them holding a sign\nsaying 'Al-Qasam's next targets'.\n\n  * Copy link to paste in your message\n\nHe posted on Facebook the same year that 'Hamas' rockets are an oppressed\npeople's audible cry for help' and commented on photos of injured Israeli\nsoldiers and an Israeli tank on fire calling it 'the most beautiful site in my\neyes'\n\nA Columbia lecturer also shared pictures of protesters' posters lionizing\nmembers of terror groups, including Walid Daqqah of the Popular Front for the\nLiberation of Palestine, and Khader Adnan, former spokesman for Palestine\nIslamic Jihad (PIJ).\n\n'PIJ is holding hostages right now,' Columbia teacher Hagar Chemali wrote on\nX, formerly known a Twitter. 'I was stunned & horrified to see the images of\nthese men, being extolled as though they're some kind of heroes.\n\n'It was like a punch in the gut' he added. 'I believe that these students,\nwhile young and clearly lost, seem to know exactly who & what they're\nsupporting.'\n\nProtesters have said they condemn anti-semitism, and even held a Jewish\npassover ceremony in their Columbia camp last week.\n\nAnd a week before the protests began, more than 20 Jewish faculty members at\nColumbia wrote a letter in the student-run Columbia Daily Spectator saying\nlegitimate criticism of the Israeli government was being falsely labeled as\n'antisemitism'.\n\n'To argue that taking a stand against Israel's war on Gaza is antisemitic is\nto pervert the meaning of the term,' the teachers wrote.\n\nBut Small said Columbia protesters on April 24 were heard chanting 'Al-Qasam,\nHamas, make us proud, take another soldier out', 'there's only one solution,\nintifada, revolution', 'We want justice, you say how? Burn Tel Aviv to the\nground', and 'Yes Hamas, we love you, we support your rockets too'.\n\n'I've attended events at NYU and Columbia since October 7th,' Small said. 'I\nsaw professors and doctoral students arguing that all of Israel is occupation,\nthat October 7 was resistance which is morally justified.'\n\nHis ISGAP report called for an investigation of SJP and its donor\norganizations.\n\n'It is clear that individuals who previously worked for Hamas-linked charities\nare now a driving force behind AMP and hence NSJP/SJP,' the report said.\n\n'The Department of Education (DoE) should carry out an immediate investigation\ninto which universities are funding and/or supporting NSJP/SJP activities and\ninstruct those universities to cease such funding and/or support.\n\n'The Department of Justice (FBI) should open a formal investigation into\nAmerican Muslims for Palestine (AMP), one of the founding organizations of\nNSJP/SJP, on the charge of potential material support for terrorism under 18\nU.S. Code \u00a7 2339B.\n\n'ISGAP calls for SJP (and its affiliated organizations) to be banned and for\nJewish students to be protected.'\n\nAMP\u2019s attorney had a scathing response to ISGAP\u2019s calls for a federal probe.\n\n\u2018The Department of Justice decides for itself who presents a threat, and need\nnot wait on a report from a purported \u201cthink tank\u201d citing non-dispositive case\nallegations before it decides how to keep our country safe and who presents a\nthreat,\u2019 Jump told DailyMail.com. \u2018AMP remains in full compliance with all\napplicable laws.\u2019\n\nColumbia University banned SJP and JVP in November. The New York Civil\nLiberties Union and Palestine Legal have sued the university over the\nsuspension, calling it 'unlawful'.\n\nIsrael-HamasHamasPalestineIsrael\n\nRead more:\n\n  * Wespac Foundation Inc - Full Filing- Nonprofit Explorer - ProPublica\n  * October 31, 2023 - Attorney General's Office Opens Investigation Into American Muslims for Palestine Nonprofit\n  * Calls for Violence against Israel at Annual AMP Conference in Chicago\n  * AMP Official Defends Hamas, Praises Israeli Casualties :: The Investigative Project on Terrorism\n  * A Jewish Voice For Peace Inc - Full Filing- Nonprofit Explorer - ProPublica\n  * SJP Founder Bazian Apologizes For Anti-Semitic Images\n  * www.adl.org/reso...\n  * Jewish faculty reject the weaponization of antisemitism\n  * Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine & Jewish Voice for Peace v.
