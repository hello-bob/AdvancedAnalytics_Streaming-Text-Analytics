Recruiters say their curriculums are outdated and graduates of these courses are largely unemployable.\n  * Some startups in South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya are providing hands-on training in new technologies, and have helped thousands of young Africans find jobs.\n\nAfter she graduated with a computer science degree from a state university in\nNigeria late last year, Oyinda Olatunji was confident she\u2019d land a job with a\nlocal data science company by March. She had been through four rounds of\ninterviews and thought the company would soon make her an offer.\n\nThe company, however, decided to go with another candidate who had experience\nworking on artificial intelligence. Olatunji had studied topics like data\nscience and machine learning in college, but the course did not include any\npractical, real-world examples of how AI works. \u201cA data mining course that I\ndid at university was all theory and I just don\u2019t have the right skills that\nrecruitment companies look for,\u201d Olatunji told Rest of World. \u201cAs a result,\njob hunting has grown increasingly difficult.\u201d The 23-year-old said she has\nmissed out on several other job opportunities due to a lack of practical\nexperience in new technologies.\n\nSeveral other African tech graduates have faced similar challenges.\n\nMore than 100 African universities offer courses related to AI, including data\nscience and machine learning. But recruitment consultants and academics told\nRest of World that graduates from these courses are largely unemployable\nbecause the programs are not up-to-date with the industry\u2019s requirements.\nSeveral startups have stepped up to bridge this gap: They give young African\ntech graduates practical experience in AI by organizing projects and\ncompetitions where they can win cash prizes. These companies, including Zindi\nin South Africa, DSNai and ChipLab in Nigeria, and ALX in Kenya, have helped\nthousands of students find jobs.\n\n\u201cAfrica\u2019s higher learning institutions have struggled to design curricula that\nalign with the ever-evolving technology landscape, making it difficult for\ngraduates to have the right AI skills,\u201d Abdul Moosa, chief technology officer\nat cybersecurity firm Cyberport Africa, told Rest of World. \u201cPrivate AI\nstartups have emerged to assist graduates in acquiring relevant, practical,\ntailor-made AI skills and are collaborating with companies to provide\ninternships. Those with such skills have huge success [in the job market].\u201d\n\nIn the first two months of 2024, over 100,000 students enrolled in programs by\nALX, a Kenya-based e-learning platform that offers courses related to data\nscience and software engineering. The company, founded in 2015, started\noffering AI courses in 2018. Nearly 85% of South African students who took\nALX\u2019s courses have found relevant jobs, Bavesh Sooka, the company\u2019s general\nmanager in South Africa, told Rest of World.\n\nZindi, a 6-year-old company, has seen nearly 73,000 data scientists use its\nplatform, where it hosts hackathons and boot camps to train graduates and\nmatch them with potential employers, CEO Celina Lee told Rest of World. Zindi\nis backed by investors like AI firm InstaDeep and investment firm Founders\nFactory Africa \u2014 it has helped over 100 engineers find jobs with Microsoft,\nGoogle, and Meta.\n\n\u201cWe came up with a model to challenge the notion that data-related solutions\ncould only be found outside of Africa,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThe idea was to develop\nAfrican talent so that the continent could solve data-related problems without\nhaving to look outside of Africa for solutions.\u201d\n\nLawrence Moruye, who has a degree in mathematical sciences from Senegal,\nsigned up for Zindi in September 2018. He wanted to learn programming skills\nthat his school did not teach. Participating in hackathons on Zindi helped him\nget there.\n\n\u201cThe hackathons on Zindi taught me how to apply theory to solving real data-\nrelated problems and to find solutions \u2014 something that we never learned at\nvarsity,\u201d Moruye told Rest of World. His experience earned him scholarships\nfrom Meta and Google to pursue a master\u2019s degree in machine learning. He now\nworks as a data scientist at African e-commerce major Jumia.\n\n> \"Africa is not prepared to reach its full AI potential because we do not\n> have enough talent.\"\n\nThe training provided by startups like Zindi is critical at a time when\nseveral African countries are dealing with high levels of unemployment,\naccording to Abdul-Khaaliq Mohammed, an engineering professor at the\nUniversity of the Witwatersrand in South Africa.\n\n\u201cEven after finishing a data science degree, graduates are finding that they\nare not experts in machine learning and AI, and for this, they require\ntraining and upskilling,\u201d Mohammed told Rest of World. \u201cNew players in AI and\nmachine learning education are quicker to respond to the new trends, and by\nupskilling graduates, they increase their chances of being employed in the\nface of an unemployment crisis.\u201d\n\nThe South African Ministry of Higher Education, Science, and Innovation, which\nis responsible for overseeing the quality of university education in the\ncountry, did not respond to Rest of World\u2019s request for comment.\n\nThere is an acute shortage of AI-related talent in Africa, and governments\nacross the continent need to step in to find a solution, according to\nPipeloluwa Olayiwola, an engineering professor at Obafemi Awolowo University\nin Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAfrica is not prepared to reach its full AI potential because we do not have\nenough talent,\u201d Olayiwola told Rest of World. The few startups available may\nnot have what it takes to train enough professionals, he said. \u201cThe best way\nis for African governments to invest in university AI programs. This, coupled\nwith private startups, will help build an adequate number of AI\nprofessionals.\u201d\n\nKimberly Mutandiro is a Labor x Tech reporting fellow at Rest of World based\nin Johannesburg, South Africa.\n\nRead more stories\n\n3 Minutes With\n\nWhat it takes to raise a $300 million VC fund for Africa\n\nTidjane Deme talks about convincing investors to back Africa-focused tech\nfunds amid a global funding slump.\n\nBy David I.
