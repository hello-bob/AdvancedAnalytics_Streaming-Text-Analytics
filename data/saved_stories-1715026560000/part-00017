It feels\nlike a more natural order of things; for me it was reversed. I had a few years\nof intense cynicism growing up. Pessimism to the extreme, mental health issues\nmaking it seem like the only way to be, you know the deal.\n\nMy experience with cynicism and pessimism is this: cynics are sure of their\npessimism; usually they are cynics not by choice, but by an inevitable inner\ncertainty of understanding that doesn\u2019t leave them another option. Optimists\nare different. In most cases, to be an optimist you have to be deeply aware of\nthe reasons to be pessimistic, and choose to go the other way. To hear the\ncommon advice of \u201chaving no expectations so you don\u2019t get disappointed\u201d and\ndecide to have expectations anyway- it\u2019s a very conscious choice, at least in\nmy case.\n\nWhat is a life without expectations? Why live just to not get disappointed?\nAre we that afraid of difficult feelings that we\u2019re willing to numb ourselves\noff to the experience of life just to avoid sitting with hard emotions for a\nwhile? I don\u2019t mind getting disappointed, it\u2019s literally a part of life. If\nyou deconstruct it it seems like questionable logic: having expectations makes\nus happy - C.S. Lewis said that joy is sometimes a state of wanting, of\nexpecting, and not quite having (\u201can unsatisfied desire which is itself more\ndesirable than any other satisfaction\u201d). Having no expectations as a way to\nnot get disappointed and thus to keep yourself happier, is self-contradictory.\nIt can work for a while, but it isn\u2019t that great of a life strategy, that is\nif one of your goals in life is to experience it and to allow yourself to be\nhappy. Are we truly happy when we have zero expectations from our lives,\nourselves, the people around us? I\u2019m not sure - maybe someone can comment and\nlet me know if you\u2019ve been there. While this strategy may lower the risk of\ndisappointment over your lifetime, what\u2019s the cost? I guess what I\u2019m saying is\nI\u2019d rather have expectations and get disappointed than have no expectations at\nall.\n\nShare\n\nChoosing to be optimistic and internalising this way of seeing the world also\nhas many tangible benefits: better mental and physical health, increased\nmotivation (since you expect things are likely to work out), increased\ngratitude, and an overall positive feedback loop. Knowing what it\u2019s like to be\non both ends, one of my biggest fears when I realized I was doing well was\nlosing my newfound optimism. Going back to being cynical without realising it\nuntil I was too deep in.\n\nThere\u2019s also something to be said for people who have gotten hurt and\ndisappointed before but still choose to remain optimistic and have\nexpectations - an extremely difficult thing to do. I was talking to a friend\nwho has been betrayed by people a lot in the past, in big ways, but is very\nconscious about not letting that make her \u201cclose off her heart\u201d. She doesn\u2019t\nwant to live a life of suspicion or numbness or expected disappointment. She\nwants to continue expecting things to be good, knowing that sometimes they\naren\u2019t. She sees that as a more valuable life experience, and considers it a\nbetter way to spend her time on earth; at the end of the day that\u2019s what it\ncomes down to. (Of course, that\u2019s unfortunately easier said than done. I\nacknowledge that I am speaking as someone who has never had anything extremely\ntragic happen in her life, and maybe that\u2019s what allows me to think this way.\nI\u2019m not preaching optimism as a way to be, but rather merely exploring the way\nI think about the concept at this point in my life.)\n\nIn the middle of the spectrum there\u2019s realism, although I don\u2019t know if anyone\nis ever truly in the middle. I think you\u2019re a bit realistic either way but\nwith a sprinkle of optimism or pessimism. I\u2019m a realist in the way that I\nrecognize that so so often, things go well; I don\u2019t think optimism is\ndelusional, it\u2019s just a point of focus.\n\nMe of 10 years ago would not have been able to relate to me of today at all.\nOptimism is central to how I choose to live. It\u2019s also a way to attract more\nlike-minded people; a conscious optimization for having influences around me\nthat remind me to feel good about life (truly the biggest life hack).\n\nMy small conclusion here is that I love being optimistic, and I think knowing\nwhat the other side is like makes me appreciate it a lot more. I\u2019m realistic;\nI know things are very often not good. But they also very often are. I\u2019m 24;\nnot enough to have more answers, but enough to know that.\n\nLeave a comment\n\n25\n\nShare this post\n\n#### On optimism\n\nerifili.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nEvading categorization\n\nTranscending easy definitions\n\nDec 27, 2023 \u2022\n\nErifili Gounari\n\n17\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Evading categorization\n\nerifili.substack.com\n\n9\n\nIdeas I've been collecting #2\n\nGrocery list of ideas, from my notes app to you\n\nFeb 22 \u2022\n\nErifili Gounari\n\n11\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Ideas I've been collecting #2\n\nerifili.substack.com\n\n7\n\nIt's not that deep\n\nbut also, it really is\n\nApr 3 \u2022\n\nErifili Gounari\n\n10\n\nShare this post\n\n#### It's not that deep\n\nerifili.substack.com\n\n6\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Erifili Gounari\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
