It takes time, planning, and above all, action.\nIt doesn't happen overnight and there are no shortcuts. However, getting\nstarted is easier than you might think.\n\nI want to share three steps you can take today to start building your brand.\nAll you need is one hour.\n\n## The hardest part is starting\n\nThis is Issue 17 of DW News. One of my 2024 goals is to write a weekly\nnewsletter. It's not easy, but I'm doing it every week. What was the hardest\npart? Without a doubt, it was starting.\n\nIf you don't start something, you'll never truly know how it can impact your\nlife. That's why it's so important to start. Anything is possible but first,\nyou have to start.\n\nIn case you're not convinced why you should start building your brand, here\nare a few reasons:\n\n  * Connect with like-minded people\n  * Learn what you do and don't know so you can grow\n  * Help others by sharing your knowledge\n  * Open doors to new opportunities\n\nAnd perhaps the biggest reason...\n\nYour brand stays with you. Jobs and companies don't.\n\nNow that you know why you should start building your brand, let's get started.\n\n## Step 1: Engage (30 minutes)\n\nWhen you first decide to build your brand, the single most important action\nyou can take is to engage. Engagement leads to visibility which leads to new\nfollowers.\n\nEvery social network has a main feed. You'll see posts from your followers and\nprospective followers. The best type of engagement is a comment, but not any\ncomment.\n\nAvoid writing useless comments like:\n\n  * I agree!\n  * \ud83d\udc4d\n  * Great post!\n\nInstead, think about these questions when you add a comment:\n\n  * What did I learn from this post?\n  * Why did this post grab my attention?\n  * How can I relate to this post?\n  * What additional insight can I add to this post?\n\nA thoughtful, original comment will stand out to not only the author of the\npost but also their followers. This can lead to profile views and even new\nfollowers.\n\nAnother great way to engage with your network is through direct messages. When\nyou come across people who are sharing content that you like, reach out and\nsay hello. Tell them why you like their posts and get to know them. After all,\nit's called social media for a reason.\n\nFollow new people with similar jobs and interests. These people are more\nlikely to follow you back.\n\nNow that you know how to engage, it's your turn.\n\n  * Set a timer for 15 minutes\n  * Open up the social network you're targeting\n  * Go to your main feed\n  * Like and comment on posts that resonate with you\n  * When the timer goes off, set it for another 15 minutes\n  * Review the posts you just engaged with and follow some of those people\n  * Go to your followers or connections list\n  * Pick 3 old or new connections and send them each a message\n\nFrom here on out, make sure to engage regularly. It's okay if you miss a day.\nFocus on consistency. You want people to know you're active on social media\nand providing value with your posts and comments. Start with 15 minutes and go\nfrom there.\n\n## Step 2: Plan your posts (10 minutes)\n\nWhether you want to post once a week or twenty times a week, I highly suggest\nyou put some thought into it. Planned content is much more likely to get\nengagements than spontaneous content. Posts that hook the reader from the\nstart, are well organized and focus on a single idea are hard to write on the\nfly.\n\nGive yourself some time to plan your posts. Weekends are great for this. Start\nwith 30 minutes and increase if necessary. Spend that time creating some draft\nposts that you can publish the following week.\n\nIf you're not sure what to post about, start here:\n\n  * What do I love?\n  * What am I good at?\n  * What are some things I know a lot about?\n\nNext, answer these questions:\n\n  * Why do I love that?\n  * Why am I good at that?\n  * What is something new I learned recently?\n  * What problem did I solve recently?\n  * What knowledge can I share with others?\n\nYour answers will help you create content to build your brand.\n\nFigure out when you can plan and schedule it.\n\n  * Set a timer for 10 minutes\n  * Go to your calendar\n  * Find 30 minutes when you're available and block that time to plan your posts\n  * With the remaining time, start answering the questions above\n  * Turn your answers into topics and subtopics for your posts\n\n## Step 3: Create a newsletter signup page (20 minutes)\n\nThere's a reason why every successful builder, creator, and entrepreneur has a\nnewsletter. Email is more effective than social media. Think about it. Would\nyou rather post online and wonder if the algorithm gods will be friendly to\nyou or send content directly to the inbox of your subscribers?\n\nStart growing your mailing list now. You can even wait until you have a\ncritical mass of subscribers before writing your newsletter.\n\nYou can use ConvertKit to create a signup page and start a mailing list for\nfree. Here's what to do:\n\n  * Sign up for a free account on ConvertKit\n  * Create a landing page (use one of their templates)\n  * Copy the link to your landing page\n  * Paste the link into your social media bios\n\nYou now have a signup page. You can start growing your mailing list and rely\nless on social media algorithms.\n\nI hope this was helpful. If you followed all three steps, let me know. I'd\nlove to hear about it.\n\nContact me any time. I'm happy to be a resource while you build your brand.\n\nThanks for reading this week. See you next week. \ud83d\udc4b\n\n## David Weiss\n\n### Founder \u2022 Made by DW\n\nFollow me on X, LinkedIn, & Instagram  \n---  \n  \n# Made by DW\n\nDavid Weiss\n\nHi!
