Both bands are known to push\nthe boundaries of live performances. But they\u2019ve rarely approached it the same\nway. U2\u2019s 40-show Sphere run was a polished, extravagant rock show with\n(nearly) identical set lists the whole way through. The Sphere was a perfect\ncanvas for making rock stars like Bono and The Edge appear not just larger\nthan life but supersized.\n\nBy contrast, Phish is only doing four performances and has no plans of\nrepeating even a single song. And judging by recent interviews, Abigail Rosen\nHolmes, the show\u2019s co-creative director, didn\u2019t want to risk overdoing the\nvisuals; her goal was always to keep the focus on Phish and the music, while\nusing the Sphere\u2019s 160,000-square-foot LED screen to enhance the tunes \u2014 not\ndistract from them. \u201cWe wanted to absolutely make the most out of the room and\nalso support Phish doing what Phish does best,\u201d she told The Washington Post.\nAnd what Phish does best are jams, improvisation, and showcasing the group\u2019s\nnext-level musicality.\n\nPhish\u2019s Trey Anastasio during one of the band\u2019s December performances at\nMadison Square Garden.\n\nPhoto by Chris Welch / The Verge\n\nBut that was before night one, back when Holmes and Phish frontman Trey\nAnastasio were keeping mum about what the show would entail beyond saying all\nfour nights would be linked by a particular theme. Now, the first show is in\nthe books, and it went off without a hitch. Fans in attendance seemed enamored\nby the experience, and those livestreaming from home praised night one as\namong the best-sounding Phish shows they\u2019ve ever heard \u2014 even if they didn\u2019t\nget to live through all the immersion firsthand. The visuals spanning the\nSphere\u2019s humongous screen were suitably trippy but never went overboard.\n\nThis morning, as Phish\u2019s legions in Vegas were resting up for round two\ntonight, I chatted with the show\u2019s other co-creative director, Jean-Baptiste\nHardoin, and producer Daniel Jean. Both work at the Montreal-based Moment\nFactory. Skim through the company\u2019s projects, and it\u2019s immediately clear that\nHardoin and Co. are comfortable working in one-of-a-kind venue spaces. They\u2019ve\ndone domes before. But four nights of Phish at the Sphere called for a lot of\npreparation and visualizations that would be flexible enough to keep up if a\n10-minute song suddenly stretched to 25 minutes.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty clear, the dos and donts, with the band,\u201d Hardoin said. \u201cPhish\nwas working more than ever with visual creation. It was interesting to pave\nthis road together and explore.\u201d Four completely different shows made for a\ndaunting challenge \u2014 U2 ran the same playbook every night \u2014 and there wasn\u2019t a\nton of time between when the Sphere run was announced in the fall and this\nweek\u2019s performances. \u201cWe had to kind of reinvent our production pipeline,\u201d\nJean told me. \u201cSo we went to our innovation team to see how we can hijack some\ntechnologies to create content at a more fast pace.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe started with the idea of doing 70 percent pre-rendered scenes, which is\ndone more in a traditional way with CG and all, and 30 percent real time using\nUnreal Engine and Notch and some AI,\u201d Jean said. By the time the shows rolled\naround, that balance ended up looking more like 50/50. This is Phish, after\nall, and jams don\u2019t exactly lend themselves to pre-rendered video. \u201cIn fact,\nwe\u2019re now playing real time content in 16K by 16K, which we believe has never\nbeen done before,\u201d Jean said.\n\nSome moments last night felt like you were seeing enormous versions of the old\nvisualizers from Winamp or iTunes. Others brought the crowd into intricate,\ndazzling scenes. \u201cThis place is very theatrical,\u201d Hardoin said. \u201cSometimes you\njust put a nice environment in the space, and people are surrounded by this\nenvironment. You don\u2019t need to be so hectic about movements and stuff\nhappening. You just need to leave them for awhile to enjoy the music.\u201d There\nare always going to be people who expect more. But you\u2019ve also got to consider\nthat a fair percentage of these audiences will be under the influence of\nsomething, and you can only push their senses so far. The Sphere is IMAX on\nsteroids. It can be a lot, even when you\u2019re stone-cold sober.\n\nA dome filled with Winamp visualizations? I want to go to there.\n\nImage: Alive Coverage\n\nCo-creative director Jean-Baptiste Hardoin says sometimes it\u2019s just about\nsetting a scene and letting people enjoy the music.\n\nImage: Alive Coverage\n\nThe team got a chance to preview how the show would look at the Sphere in\nMarch. But their in-person collaboration began much earlier: Anastasio told\nThe Associated Press that he first met with Holmes for early planning back in\nJune. According to Hardoin, there were also get-togethers in Montreal and New\nYork City. Even when apart, Holmes, Hardoin, and Anastasio touched base\nconstantly (often daily) to discuss art direction, stage / lighting design,\npotential set lists for each night, and so on.\n\nThere\u2019s only one full-size Sphere. But a miniature version was built for the\npurpose of nailing the hyper-directional audio mix, which is handled by\nPhish\u2019s soundman, Garry Brown. He told The Washington Post that Phish would\nhave \u201ca soundscape that is a lot wider than what U2 did.\u201d\n\nPhish fans get three more nights of this.\n\nImage: Alive Coverage\n\nMoment Factory used Unreal Engine and Notch software for many animations.\n\nImage: Alive Coverage\n\nMoment Factory also built a mini-dome for test viewings at its Montreal home\nbase. When not there, the company\u2019s artists and designers spent many hours in\nvirtual reality, working with a digital representation of the Sphere to sample\nhow their visualizations and CGI set pieces would look from every angle in the\nplace. \u201cAs much as we can prepare for a show like this, there\u2019s no way we can\nsee the outcome before it\u2019s happening in real time,\u201d Jean said. Reading that\nvibe and responding to it is where the Unreal and Notch-powered animations can\nprove valuable. The team can dial things up or down at will. \u201cWe knew that we\ncould adapt to what we feel in the room at this specific moment.\u201d\n\nSo far, the Sphere has only had two bands grace its stage. Dead and Company\nwill become the third next month. I asked Hardoin what his advice is for\nanyone lucky enough to dream up a future event there. His answer was simple.\n\u201cTry stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a new paradigm for live experiences, music shows,\nand so on. Some things have been challenges in the creative process. We\u2019re not\nused to such environments [and considered things like] would people experience\nmotion sickness? Is it too fast? Is it not immersive enough? My advice would\nbe to try stuff.\u201d\n\nPhish\u2019s remaining three nights at the Sphere can be livestreamed from the\nband\u2019s website. If you\u2019re only interested in the audio side, SiriusXM is\nbroadcasting each show the following day on Phish\u2019s station and will go live\nfor the final performance on Sunday.\n\nI\u2019ll end by passing along a request to Phish\u2019s video production crew from many\nof those who watched from home last night. Just stick with the wide shots,\ny\u2019all. This is the Sphere we\u2019re talking about. Let the people take it all in \u2014\neven if it\u2019s never going to be the same as having a ticket.\n\nMost Popular\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1. ## Tesla recalls all 3,878 Cybertrucks over faulty accelerator pedal\n\n  2. ## The invisible seafaring industry that keeps the internet afloat\n\n  3. ## AirPlay turns the Delta emulator into a full-on retro console\n\n  4. ## Emulators are taking over the App Store\n\n  5. ## How Phish turned Las Vegas\u2019 Sphere into the ultimate music visualizer\n\nFrom our sponsor\n\nAdvertiser Content From\n\n## More from Entertainment\n\n  * ### You can buy a refurbished Steam Deck for almost half off\n\n  * ### Applying the mathematical principles of Pareto to Mario Kart 8\n\n  * ### Target confirms it\u2019s all but completely ditching DVDs in physical stores\n\n  * ### The Hades 2 technical test is a trial in self-control\n\n  * Advertiser Content From\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n  * How We Rate and Review Products\n\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Jobs @ Vox Media\n\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
