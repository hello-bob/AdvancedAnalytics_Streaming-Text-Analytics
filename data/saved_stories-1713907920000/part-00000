Tiny11\nbuilder, now completely overhauled. After more than a year (for which I am so\nsorry) of no updates, tiny11 builder is now a much more complete and flexible\nsolution - one script fits all. Also, it is a steppingstone for an even more\nfleshed-out solution. You can now use it on ANY Windows 11 release (not just a\nspecific build), as well as ANY language or architecture. This is made\npossible thanks to the much-improved scripting capabilities of PowerShell,\ncompared to the older Batch release. Since it is written in PowerShell, make\nsure to set the execution policy to Unrestricted, so that you could run the\nscript. If you haven't done this before, make sure to run: Set-ExecutionPolicy\nunrestricted as administrator in PowerShell before running the script,\notherwise it would just crash.\n\nThis is a script created to automate the build of a streamlined Windows 11\nimage, similar to tiny11. My main goal is to use only Microsoft utilities like\nDISM, and no utilities from external sources. The only executable included is\noscdimg.exe, which is provided in the Windows ADK and it is used to create\nbootable ISO images. Also included is an unattended answer file, which is used\nto bypass the Microsoft Account on OOBE and to deploy the image with the\n/compact flag. It's open-source, so feel free to add or remove anything you\nwant! Feedback is also much appreciated.\n\nInstructions:\n\n  1. Download Windows 11 from the Microsoft website (https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11)\n  2. Mount the downloaded ISO image using Windows Explorer.\n  3. Select the drive letter where the image is mounted (only the letter, no colon (:))\n  4. Select the SKU that you want the image to be based.\n  5. Sit back and relax :)\n  6. When the image is completed, you will see it in the folder where the script was extracted, with the name tiny11.iso\n\nWhat is removed:\n\n  * Clipchamp\n  * News\n  * Weather\n  * Xbox (although Xbox Identity provider is still here, so it should be possible to be reinstalled with no issues)\n  * GetHelp\n  * GetStarted\n  * Office Hub\n  * Solitaire\n  * PeopleApp\n  * PowerAutomate\n  * ToDo\n  * Alarms\n  * Mail and Calendar\n  * Feedback Hub\n  * Maps\n  * Sound Recorder\n  * Your Phone\n  * Media Player\n  * QuickAssist\n  * Internet Explorer\n  * Tablet PC Math\n  * Edge\n  * OneDrive\n\nKnown issues:\n\n  1. Although Edge is removed, there are some remnants in the Settings. But the app in itself is deleted. You can install any browser using WinGet (after you update the app using Microsoft Store)\n  2. Outlook and Dev Home might reappear after some time.\n  3. If you are using this script on arm64, you might see a glimpse of an error while running the script. This is caused by the fact that the arm64 image doesn't have OneDriveSetup.exe included in the System32 folder.\n\nAnd that's pretty much it for now! Thanks for trying it and let me know how\nyou like it!\n\n## About\n\nScripts to build a trimmed-down Windows 11 image.\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n4.4k stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n74 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n405 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Contributors 4\n\n  * ntdevlabs NTDEV\n  * szepeviktor Viktor Sz\u00e9pe\n  * jasonpatrickellykrause Jason Krause\n  * T-r-y-o-k-s Tryoks\n\n## Languages\n\n  * PowerShell 100.0%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
