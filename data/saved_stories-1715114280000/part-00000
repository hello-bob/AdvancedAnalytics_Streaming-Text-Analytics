to stay\ncompetitive hits tech industry\n\nPublished Fri, May 3 20247:00 AM EDTUpdated Fri, May 3 202410:42 AM EDT\n\nHayden Field@haydenfield\n\nWATCH LIVE\n\nKey Points\n\n  * Artificial intelligence engineers at top tech companies told CNBC that the pressure to roll out AI tools at breakneck speed has come to define their jobs.\n  * They say that much of their work is assigned to appease investors rather than to solve problems for end users, and that they are often chasing OpenAI.\n  * Burnout is an increasingly common theme as AI workers say their employers are pursuing projects without regard for the technology\u2019s effect on climate change, surveillance and other potential real-world harms.\n\nA picture shows logos of the big technology companies named GAFAM, for Google,\nApple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft, in Mulhouse, France, on June 2, 2023.\n\nSebastien Bozon | AFP | Getty Images\n\nLate last year, an artificial intelligence engineer at Amazon was wrapping up\nthe work week and getting ready to spend time with some friends visiting from\nout of town. Then, a Slack message popped up. He suddenly had a deadline to\ndeliver a project by 6 a.m. on Monday.\n\nThere went the weekend. The AI engineer bailed on his friends, who had\ntraveled from the East Coast to the Seattle area. Instead, he worked day and\nnight to finish the job.\n\nBut it was all for nothing. The project was ultimately \u201cdeprioritized,\u201d the\nengineer told CNBC. He said it was a familiar result. AI specialists, he said,\ncommonly sprint to build new features that are often suddenly shelved in favor\nof a hectic pivot to another AI project.\n\nThe engineer, who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation, said he had\nto write thousands of lines of code for new AI features in an environment with\nzero testing for mistakes. Since code can break if the required tests are\npostponed, the Amazon engineer recalled periods when team members would have\nto call one another in the middle of the night to fix aspects of the AI\nfeature\u2019s software.\n\nAI workers at other Big Tech companies, including Google and Microsoft, told\nCNBC about the pressure they are similarly under to roll out tools at\nbreakneck speeds due to the internal fear of falling behind the competition in\na technology that, according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, is having its \u201ciPhone\nmoment.\u201d\n\nThe tech workers spoke to CNBC mostly on the condition that they remain\nunnamed because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak to the media. The experiences\nthey shared illustrate a broader trend across the industry, rather than a\nsingle company\u2019s approach to AI.\n\nThey spoke of accelerated timelines, chasing rivals\u2019 AI announcements and an\noverall lack of concern from their superiors about real-world effects, themes\nthat appear common across a broad spectrum of the biggest tech companies \u2014\nfrom Apple to Amazon to Google.\n\nEngineers and those with other roles in the field said an increasingly large\npart of their job was focused on satisfying investors and not falling behind\nthe competition rather than solving actual problems for users. Some said they\nwere switched over to AI teams to help support fast-paced rollouts without\nhaving adequate time to train or learn about AI, even if they are new to the\ntechnology.\n\nA common feeling they described is burnout from immense pressure, long hours\nand mandates that are constantly changing. Many said their employers are\nlooking past surveillance concerns, AI\u2019s effect on the climate and other\npotential harms, all in the name of speed. Some said they or their colleagues\nwere looking for other jobs or switching out of AI departments, due to an\nuntenable pace.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO4:0404:04\n\nExpect AI to become as universal as email: HSBC\n\nSquawk Box Europe\n\nThis is the dark underbelly of the generative AI gold rush. Tech companies are\nracing to build chatbots, agents and image generators, and they\u2019re spending\nbillions of dollars training their own large language models to ensure their\nrelevance in a market that\u2019s predicted to top $1 trillion in revenue within a\ndecade.\n\nTech\u2019s megacap companies aren\u2019t being shy about acknowledging to investors and\nemployees how much AI is shaping their decision-making.\n\nMicrosoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood, on an earnings call earlier this\nyear, said the software company is \u201crepivoting our workforce toward the AI-\nfirst work we\u2019re doing without adding material number of people to the\nworkforce,\u201d and said Microsoft will continue to prioritize investing in AI as\n\u201cthe thing that\u2019s going to shape the next decade.\u201d\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg spent much of his opening remarks on his company\u2019s\nearnings call last week focused on AI products and services and the\nadvancements in its large language model called Llama 3.\n\n\u201cThis leads me to believe that we should invest significantly more over the\ncoming years to build even more advanced models and the largest scale AI\nservices in the world,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\nAt Amazon, CEO Andy Jassy told investors last week that the \u201cgenerative AI\nopportunity\u201d is almost unprecedented, and that increased capital spending is\nnecessary to take advantage of it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if any of us has seen a possibility like this in technology in a\nreally long time, for sure since the cloud, perhaps since the Internet,\u201d Jassy\nsaid.\n\n## Speed above everything\n\nOn the ground floor, where those investments are taking place, things can get\nmessy.\n\nThe Amazon engineer, who lost his weekend to a project that was ultimately\nscuttled, said higher-ups seemed to be doing things just to \u201ctick a checkbox,\u201d\nand that speed, rather than quality, was the priority while trying to recreate\nproducts coming out of Microsoft or OpenAI.\n\nIn an emailed statement to CNBC, an Amazon spokesperson said, the company is\n\u201cfocused on building and deploying useful, reliable, and secure generative AI\ninnovations that reinvent and enhance customers\u2019 experiences,\u201d and that Amazon\nis supporting its employees to \u201cdeliver those innovations.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s inaccurate and misleading to use a single employee\u2019s anecdote to\ncharacterize the experience of all Amazon employees working in AI,\u201d the\nspokesperson said.\n\nLast year marked the beginning of the generative AI boom, following the debut\nof OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT near the end of 2022. Since then, Microsoft, Alphabet,\nMeta, Amazon and others have been snapping up Nvidia\u2019s processors, which are\nat the core of most big AI models.\n\nWhile companies such as Alphabet and Amazon continue to downsize their total\nheadcount, they\u2019re aggressively hiring AI experts and pouring resources into\nbuilding their models and developing features for consumers and businesses.\n\nEric Gu, a former Apple employee who spent about four years working on AI\ninitiatives, including for the Vision Pro headset, said that toward the end of\nhis time at the company, he felt \u201cboxed in.\u201d\n\n\u201cApple is a very product-focused company, so there\u2019s this intense pressure to\nimmediately be productive, start shipping and contributing features,\u201d Gu said.\nHe said that even though he was surrounded by \u201cthese brilliant people,\u201d there\nwas no time to really learn from them.\n\n\u201cIt boils down to the pace at which it felt like you had to ship and perform,\u201d\nsaid Gu, who left Apple a year ago to join AI startup Imbue, where he said he\ncan work on equally ambitious projects but at a more measured pace.\n\nApple declined to comment.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella (R) speaks as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman (L) looks on\nduring the OpenAI DevDay event in San Francisco on Nov. 6, 2023.\n\nJustin Sullivan | Getty Images\n\nAn AI engineer at Microsoft said the company is engaged in an \u201cAI rat race.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to ethics and safeguards, he said, Microsoft has cut corners in\nfavor of speed, leading to rushed rollouts without sufficient concerns about\nwhat could follow. The engineer said there\u2019s a recognition that because all of\nthe large tech companies have access to most of the same data, there\u2019s no real\nmoat in AI.\n\nMicrosoft didn\u2019t provide a comment.\n\nMorry Kolman, an independent software engineer and digital artist who has\nworked on viral projects that have garnered more than 200,000 users, said that\nin the age of rapid advancement in AI, \u201cit\u2019s hard to figure out where is worth\ninvesting your time.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that is very conducive to burnout just in the sense that it makes it hard\nto believe in something,\u201d Kolman said, adding, \u201cI think that the biggest thing\nfor me is that it\u2019s not cool or fun anymore.\u201d\n\nAt Google, an AI team member said the burnout is the result of competitive\npressure, shorter timelines and a lack of resources, particularly budget and\nheadcount. Although many top tech companies have said they are redirecting\nresources to AI, the required headcount, especially on a rushed timeline,\ndoesn\u2019t always materialize. That is certainly the case at Google, the AI\nstaffer said.\n\nThe company\u2019s hurried output has led to some public embarrassment. Google\nGemini\u2019s image-generation tool was released and promptly taken offline in\nFebruary after users discovered historical inaccuracies and questionable\nresponses. In early 2023, Google employees criticized leadership, most notably\nCEO Sundar Pichai, for what they called a \u201crushed\u201d and \u201cbotched\u201d announcement\nof its initial ChatGPT competitor called Bard.\n\nThe Google AI engineer, who has over a decade of experience in tech, said she\nunderstands the pressure to move fast, given the intense competition in\ngenerative AI, but it\u2019s all happening as the industry is in cost-cutting mode,\nwith companies slashing their workforce to meet investor demands and \u201cincrease\ntheir bottom line,\u201d she said.\n\nThere\u2019s also the conference schedule. AI teams had to prepare for the Google\nI/O developer event in May 2023, followed by Cloud Next in August and then\nanother Cloud Next conference in April 2024. That\u2019s a significantly shorter\ngap between events than normal, and created a crunch for a team that was\n\u201cbeholden to conference timelines\u201d for shipping features, the Google engineer\nsaid.\n\nGoogle didn\u2019t provide a comment for this story.\n\nThe sentiment in AI is not limited to the biggest companies.\n\nAn AI researcher at a government agency reported feeling rushed to keep up.\nEven though the government is notorious for moving slower than companies, the\npressure \u201ctrickles down everywhere,\u201d since everyone wants to get in on\ngenerative AI, the person said.\n\nAnd it\u2019s happening at startups.\n\nThere are companies getting funded by \u201creally big VC firms who are expecting\nthis 10X-like return,\u201d said Ayodele Odubela, a data scientist and AI policy\nadvisor.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to strike while the iron is hot,\u201d she said.\n\n## \u2018A big pile of nonsense\u2019\n\nRegardless of the employer, AI workers said much of their jobs involve working\non AI for the sake of AI, rather than to solve a business problem or to serve\ncustomers directly.\n\n\u201cA lot of times, it\u2019s being asked to provide a solution to a problem that\ndoesn\u2019t exist with a tool that you don\u2019t want to use,\u201d independent software\nengineer Kolman told CNBC.\n\nThe Microsoft AI engineer said a lot of tasks are about \u201ctrying to create AI\nhype\u201d with no practical use. He recalled instances when a software engineer on\nhis team would come up with an algorithm to solve a particular problem that\ndidn\u2019t involve generative AI. That solution would be pushed aside in favor of\none that used a large language model, even if it were less efficient, more\nexpensive and slower, the person said. He described the irony of using an\n\u201cinferior solution\u201d just because it involved an AI model.\n\nA software engineer at a major internet company, which the person asked to\nkeep unnamed due to his group\u2019s small size, said the new team he works on\ndedicated to AI advancement is doing large language model research \u201cbecause\nthat\u2019s what\u2019s hot right now.\u201d\n\nThe engineer has worked in machine learning for years, and described much of\nthe work in generative AI today as an \u201cextreme amount of vaporware and hype.\u201d\nEvery two weeks, the engineer said, there\u2019s some sort of big pivot, but\nultimately there\u2019s the sense that everyone is building the same thing.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO3:2303:23\n\nAmazon\u2019s partnership with Anthropic: Here\u2019s what you need to know\n\nSquawk Box\n\nHe said he often has to put together demos of AI products for the company\u2019s\nboard of directors on three-week timelines, even though the products are \u201ca\nbig pile of nonsense.\u201d There\u2019s a constant effort to appease investors and\nfight for money, he said. He gave one example of building a web app to show\ninvestors even though it wasn\u2019t related to the team\u2019s actual work. After the\npresentation, \u201cWe never touched it again,\u201d he said.\n\nA product manager at a fintech startup said one of his projects involved a\nrebranding of the company\u2019s algorithms to AI. He also worked on a ChatGPT\nplug-in for customers. Executives at the company never told the team why it\nwas needed.\n\nThe employee said it felt \u201cout of order.\u201d The company was starting with a\nsolution involving AI without ever defining the problem.\n\nAn AI engineer who works at a retail surveillance startup told CNBC that he\u2019s\nthe only AI engineer at a company of 40 people and that he handles any\nresponsibility related to AI, which is an overwhelming task.\n\nHe said the company\u2019s investors have inaccurate views on the capabilities of\nAI, often asking him to build certain things that are \u201cimpossible for me to\ndeliver.\u201d He said he hopes to leave for graduate school and to publish\nresearch independently.\n\n## Risky business\n\nThe Google staffer said that about six months into her role, she felt she\ncould finally keep her head above water. Even then, she said, the pressure\ncontinued to mount, as the demands on the team were \u201cnot sustainable.\u201d\n\nShe used the analogy of \u201cbuilding the plane while flying it\u201d to describe the\ncompany\u2019s approach to product development.\n\nAmazon Web Services CEO Adam Selipsky speaks with Anthropic CEO and co-founder\nDario Amodei during AWS re:Invent 2023, a conference hosted by Amazon Web\nServices, at The Venetian Las Vegas in Las Vegas on Nov. 28, 2023.\n\nNoah Berger | Getty Images\n\nThe Amazon AI engineer expressed a similar sentiment, saying everyone on his\ncurrent team was pulled into working on a product that was running behind\nschedule, and that many were \u201cthrown into it\u201d without relevant experience and\nonboarding.\n\nHe also said AI accuracy, and testing in general, has taken a backseat to\nprioritize speed of product rollouts despite \u201cmotivational speeches\u201d from\nmanagers about how their work will \u201crevolutionize the industry.\u201d\n\nOdubela underscored the ethical risks of inadequate training for AI workers\nand with rushing AI projects to keep up with competition. She pointed to the\nproblems with Google Gemini\u2019s image creator when the product hit the market in\nFebruary. In one instance, a user asked Gemini to show a German soldier in\n1943, and the tool depicted a racially diverse set of soldiers wearing German\nmilitary uniforms of the era, according to screenshots viewed by CNBC.\n\n\u201cThe biggest piece that\u2019s missing is lacking the ability to work with domain\nexperts on projects, and the ability to even evaluate them as stringently as\nthey should be evaluated before release,\u201d Odubela said, regarding the current\nethos in AI.\n\nAt a moment in technology when thoughtfulness is more important than ever,\nsome of the leading companies appear to be doing the opposite.\n\n\u201cI think the major harm that comes is there\u2019s no time to think critically,\u201d\nOdubela said.\n\n## Don\u2019t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO\n\n  * Most of Warren Buffett\u2019s stock portfolio is tied up in just 5 stocks.
