Visit The Keyword for all the latest news and stories from\nGoogle\n\n## Official Blog\n\nInsights from Googlers into our products, technology, and the Google culture\n\n## A new approach to China\n\nJanuary 12, 2010\n\nLike many other well-known organizations, we face cyber attacks of varying\ndegrees on a regular basis. In mid-December, we detected a highly\nsophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure originating\nfrom China that resulted in the theft of intellectual property from Google.\nHowever, it soon became clear that what at first appeared to be solely a\nsecurity incident--albeit a significant one--was something quite different.\n\nFirst, this attack was not just on Google. As part of our investigation we\nhave discovered that at least twenty other large companies from a wide range\nof businesses--including the Internet, finance, technology, media and chemical\nsectors--have been similarly targeted. We are currently in the process of\nnotifying those companies, and we are also working with the relevant U.S.\nauthorities.\n\nSecond, we have evidence to suggest that a primary goal of the attackers was\naccessing the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists. Based on our\ninvestigation to date we believe their attack did not achieve that objective.\nOnly two Gmail accounts appear to have been accessed, and that activity was\nlimited to account information (such as the date the account was created) and\nsubject line, rather than the content of emails themselves.\n\nThird, as part of this investigation but independent of the attack on Google,\nwe have discovered that the accounts of dozens of U.S.-, China- and Europe-\nbased Gmail users who are advocates of human rights in China appear to have\nbeen routinely accessed by third parties. These accounts have not been\naccessed through any security breach at Google, but most likely via phishing\nscams or malware placed on the users' computers.\n\nWe have already used information gained from this attack to make\ninfrastructure and architectural improvements that enhance security for Google\nand for our users. In terms of individual users, we would advise people to\ndeploy reputable anti-virus and anti-spyware programs on their computers, to\ninstall patches for their operating systems and to update their web browsers.\nAlways be cautious when clicking on links appearing in instant messages and\nemails, or when asked to share personal information like passwords online. You\ncan read more here about our cyber-security recommendations. People wanting to\nlearn more about these kinds of attacks can read this Report to Congress (PDF)\nby the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (see p. 163-), as\nwell as a related analysis (PDF) prepared for the Commission, Nart\nVilleneuve's blog and this presentation on the GhostNet spying incident.\n\nWe have taken the unusual step of sharing information about these attacks with\na broad audience not just because of the security and human rights\nimplications of what we have unearthed, but also because this information goes\nto the heart of a much bigger global debate about freedom of speech. In the\nlast two decades, China's economic reform programs and its citizens'\nentrepreneurial flair have lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese people out\nof poverty. Indeed, this great nation is at the heart of much economic\nprogress and development in the world today.\n\nWe launched Google.cn in January 2006 in the belief that the benefits of\nincreased access to information for people in China and a more open Internet\noutweighed our discomfort in agreeing to censor some results. At the time we\nmade clear that \"we will carefully monitor conditions in China, including new\nlaws and other restrictions on our services. If we determine that we are\nunable to achieve the objectives outlined we will not hesitate to reconsider\nour approach to China.\"\n\nThese attacks and the surveillance they have uncovered--combined with the\nattempts over the past year to further limit free speech on the web--have led\nus to conclude that we should review the feasibility of our business\noperations in China. We have decided we are no longer willing to continue\ncensoring our results on Google.cn, and so over the next few weeks we will be\ndiscussing with the Chinese government the basis on which we could operate an\nunfiltered search engine within the law, if at all. We recognize that this may\nwell mean having to shut down Google.cn, and potentially our offices in China.\n\nThe decision to review our business operations in China has been incredibly\nhard, and we know that it will have potentially far-reaching consequences. We\nwant to make clear that this move was driven by our executives in the United\nStates, without the knowledge or involvement of our employees in China who\nhave worked incredibly hard to make Google.cn the success it is today. We are\ncommitted to working responsibly to resolve the very difficult issues raised.\n\nUpdate: Added a link to another referenced report in paragraph 5.\n\nPosted by David Drummond, SVP, Corporate Development and Chief Legal Officer\n\nGoogle\n\nLabels: Asia , free expression , policy and issues , privacy , security\n\n## Labels\n\n  * accessibility 41\n  * acquisition 26\n  * ads 131\n  * Africa 19\n  * Android 59\n  * apps 419\n  * April 1 4\n  * Asia 39\n  * books + book search 48\n  * commerce 12\n  * computing history 7\n  * crisis response 33\n  * culture 12\n  * developers 120\n  * diversity 35\n  * doodles 68\n  * education and research 144\n  * entrepreneurs at Google 14\n  * Europe 46\n  * faster web 16\n  * free expression 61\n  * google.org 73\n  * googleplus 50\n  * googlers and culture 202\n  * green 102\n  * Latin America 18\n  * maps and earth 194\n  * mobile 125\n  * online safety 19\n  * open source 19\n  * photos 39\n  * policy and issues 139\n  * politics 71\n  * privacy 66\n  * recruiting and hiring 32\n  * scholarships 31\n  * search 505\n  * search quality 24\n  * search trends 118\n  * security 36\n  * small business 31\n  * user experience and usability 41\n  * youtube and video 140\n\n## Archive\n\n  * 2016\n\n    * Jan\n\n    * Feb\n\n    * Mar\n\n    * Apr\n\n    * May\n\n    * Jun\n\n    * Jul\n\n    * Aug\n\n    * Sep\n\n    * Oct\n\n    * Nov\n\n  * 2015\n\n    * Jan\n\n    * Feb\n\n    * Mar\n\n    * Apr\n\n    * May\n\n    * Jun\n\n    * Jul\n\n    * Aug\n\n    * Sep\n\n    * Oct\n\n    * Nov\n\n    * Dec\n\n  * 2014\n\n    * Jan\n\n    * Feb\n\n    * Mar\n\n    * Apr\n\n    * May\n\n    * Jun\n\n    * Jul\n\n    * Aug\n\n    * Sep\n\n    * Oct\n\n    * Nov\n\n    * Dec\n\n  * 2013\n\n    * Jan\n\n    * Feb\n\n    * Mar\n\n    * Apr\n\n    * May\n\n    * Jun\n\n    * Jul\n\n    * Aug\n\n    * Sep\n\n    * Oct\n\n    * Nov\n\n    * Dec\n\n  * 2012\n\n    * Jan\n\n    * Feb\n\n    * Mar\n\n    * Apr\n\n    * May\n\n    * Jun\n\n    * Jul\n\n    * Aug\n\n    * Sep\n\n    * Oct\n\n    * Nov\n\n    * Dec\n\n  * 2011\n\n    * Jan\n\n    * Feb\n\n    * Mar\n\n    * Apr\n\n    * May\n\n    * Jun\n\n    * Jul\n\n    * Aug\n\n    * Sep\n\n    * Oct\n\n    * Nov\n\n    * Dec\n\n  * 2010\n\n    * Jan\n\n    * Feb\n\n    * Mar\n\n    * Apr\n\n    * May\n\n    * Jun\n\n    * Jul\n\n    * Aug\n\n    * Sep\n\n    * Oct\n\n    * Nov\n\n    * Dec\n\n  * 2009\n\n    * Jan\n\n    * Feb\n\n    * Mar\n\n    * Apr\n\n    * May\n\n    * Jun\n\n    * Jul\n\n    * Aug\n\n    * Sep\n\n    * Oct\n\n    * Nov\n\n    * Dec\n\n  * 2008\n\n    * Jan\n\n    * Feb\n\n    * Mar\n\n    * Apr\n\n    * May\n\n    * Jun\n\n    * Jul\n\n    * Aug\n\n    * Sep\n\n    * Oct\n\n    * Nov\n\n    * Dec\n\n  * 2007\n\n    * Jan\n\n    * Feb\n\n    * Mar\n\n    * Apr\n\n    * May\n\n    * Jun\n\n    * Jul\n\n    * Aug\n\n    * Sep\n\n    * Oct\n\n    * Nov\n\n    * Dec\n\n  * 2006\n\n    * Jan\n\n    * Feb\n\n    * Mar\n\n    * Apr\n\n    * May\n\n    * Jun\n\n    * Jul\n\n    * Aug\n\n    * Sep\n\n    * Oct\n\n    * Nov\n\n    * Dec\n\n  * 2005\n\n    * Jan\n\n    * Feb\n\n    * Mar\n\n    * Apr\n\n    * May\n\n    * Jun\n\n    * Jul\n\n    * Aug\n\n    * Sep\n\n    * Oct\n\n    * Nov\n\n    * Dec\n\n  * 2004\n\n    * Apr\n\n    * May\n\n    * Jun\n\n    * Jul\n\n    * Aug\n\n    * Sep\n\n    * Oct\n\n    * Nov\n\n    * Dec\n\n## Feed\n\nGoogleon\n\nFollow\n\nGive us feedback in our Product Forums.\n\n## Company-wide\n\n  * Public Policy Blog\n  * Research Blog\n  * Student Blog\n\n## Products\n\n  * Official Android Blog\n  * Chrome Blog\n  * Lat Long Blog\n\n## Developers\n\n  * Developers Blog\n  * Ads Developer Blog\n  * Android Developers Blog\n\n  * Google\n  * Privacy\n  * Terms\n\nDiese Website verwendet Cookies von Google, um Dienste anzubieten und Zugriffe\nzu analysieren.
