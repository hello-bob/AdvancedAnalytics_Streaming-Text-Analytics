Of course, people talk publicly about\ntools for Extract, Load, and Transform data (that\u2019s what ETL stands for), with\ncourses and degrees for them. But web scraping can also be seen as a tool to\nextract data from websites, and, as with every tool, can be used for good and\nbad.\n\nYou can use your ETL to extract data from the payroll database of your company\nand publish all the salaries online just to damage your employer and so web\nscraping can be used to extract copyrighted data or harm the target website\u2019s\nbusiness.\n\nWeb scraping it\u2019s not in a grey area: the way it\u2019s implemented determines if\nit\u2019s illegal or not.\n\nFor this reason, at Databoutique.com (a marketplace for web data) we want to\nbreak this curtain around web scraping and create the Web Data Landscape Map,\na catalog of all the companies involved in the extraction, enrichment, and\nusage of web data.\n\nIt\u2019s a collaborative project, where anyone could contribute by sharing its\nknowledge of the industry, adding companies to the list, or solutions where\nweb data is used.\n\nBy creating the most complete map possible, we can gain clarity about the\nactors involved in web data, their role, and the solutions they\u2019re offering,\nin order to answer many of the questions that pop around, like: \u201cWhere I can\nfind residential proxies?\u201d or \u201chow can I call to scrape a Youtube channel?\u201d.\n\n## Who can be listed on the Map?\n\nFor the sake of clarity, we divided the map in two: a list of actors involved\nin web data and a list of solutions where web data are involved.\n\n### Actors\n\nThe actors involved are companies, organizations, and freelancers (within the\nboundaries of privacy laws) who explicitly offer solutions related to web\ndata.\n\n#### Data providers\n\nAny company, regardless of size, geography, or sector, and freelancer who\u2019s\nactually scraping and selling web data, on Databoutique or not, can be listed\non the map. This is particularly useful for empowering and showing your own\nbrand and capabilities, building trust before people buy data from you.\n\n#### Web Scraping enablers\n\nEvery company that provides a solution for making web scraping easier: proxy\nproviders, anti-detect browsers, API providers (and so on) can be listed on\nDataboutique. This provides visibility to the hundreds (and growing) of\ntechnical users interested in web scraping that we are already registerd on\nthe platform, who could be interested in trying their solutions. On top,\ncompanies can keep these professionals updated by adding news and discounts on\nthe platform, which will be broadcast on our channels.\n\n#### Web Data Users and System Integrators\n\nThe raw data available on Databoutique it\u2019s only the starting point: the end\nuser wants insights and that\u2019s why there are plenty of companies doing pricing\noptimization in different industries, dynamic pricing, trend forecasting, and\nso on.\n\nSometimes people on Databoutique look for data and then ask for a turn-key\nsolution, but they have difficulties in finding the right one. Being listed on\nthe Map gives your company the chance to be immediately visible beside the\ndata that customers are looking for, so you can show them what can be built on\ntop of that data they're interested into.\n\nThis is also true for System Integrators: sometimes customers prefer to buy\nraw data but don\u2019t have time to create an automated solution to load it into\ntheir systems. Being visible on the map is a good way to catch their attention\nand offer them your services.\n\n### Solutions\n\nA solution is a service commonly offered to the market used for, with, or in\nrelation to web data.\n\nEvery company offers a service to their customers, from data provisioning to\ncompetitive intelligence, a solution an extended description of these\nservices.\n\nSolutions are specific (i.e. Hotel Dynamic Pricing, Residential Proxy) and\ndon\u2019t refer to specific providers or product names.\n\nIt is the solution that allows an actor to be listed on a map, even if a\ncompany covers various services, but one of them is in relation to web data\n(i.e. they do consult on how to integrate web data) they are allowed - as long\nas there is an explicit reference in their service portfolio.\n\nActors can be associated with more than one solution, and this can evolve over\ntime. Any use can suggest a new solution and can suggest new or ceasing\nrelationships between actors and solutions.\n\n## How to submit an actor or a solution?\n\nThe process takes two minutes and it\u2019s totally free. On the actors\u2019 page, for\nexample, if the actor is not yet listed, you can suggest it by clicking the\nblue button.\n\nThis will open a guided form to submit all the needed data and, after a manual\napproval, the company will be visible on the catalog.\n\nIf you work on a company that is listed, instead, you can claim its ownership\nby clicking on the \u201cWork Here?\u201d black button and registering to Databoutique\nwith a company email.\n\nBy claiming your company profile, you gain the right to post news and manage\nits solutions attached.\n\nAre you willing to participate in populating the Web Data Landscape Map?\n\nList an actor or a solution to the map\n\nWe started by doing it by ourselves but need your help in creating the most\ncomplete map around the web data available today.\n\n## About\n\nNo description, website, or topics provided.\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\nActivity\n\nCustom properties\n\n### Stars\n\n5 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n0 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n0 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
