The debate has persisted for\nmore than a century.\n\nBy Andrew Zangwill | April 12, 2024\n\nCredit: Menno Schaefer/Adobe\n\nStarlings flock in a so-called murmuration, a collective behavior of interest\nin biological physics \u2014 one of many subfields that did not always \u201cbelong\u201d in\nphysics.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been in physics long enough, you\u2019ve probably left a colloquium or\nseminar and thought to yourself, \u201cThat talk was interesting, but it wasn\u2019t\nphysics.\u201d\n\nIf so, you\u2019re one of many physicists who muse about the boundaries of their\nfield, perhaps with colleagues over lunch. Usually, it\u2019s all in good fun.\n\nBut what if the issue comes up when a physics faculty makes decisions about\nhiring or promoting individuals to build, expand, or even dismantle a research\neffort? The boundaries of a discipline bear directly on the opportunities\ndepartments can offer students. They also influence those students\u2019 evolving\nidentities as physicists, and on how they think about their own professional\nfutures and the future of physics.\n\nSo, these debates \u2014 over physics and \u201cnot physics\u201d \u2014 are important. But they\nare also not new. For more than a century, physicists have been drawing and\nredrawing the borders around the field, embracing and rejecting subfields\nalong the way.\n\nA key moment for \u201cnot physics\u201d occurred in 1899 at the second-ever meeting of\nthe American Physical Society. In his keynote address, the APS president Henry\nRowland exhorted his colleagues to \u201ccultivate the idea of the dignity\u201d of\nphysics.\n\n\u201cMuch of the intellect of the country is still wasted in the pursuit of so-\ncalled practical science which ministers to our physical needs,\u201d he scolded,\n\u201c[and] not to investigations in the pure ethereal physics which our Society is\nformed to cultivate.\u201d\n\nRowland\u2019s elitism was not unique \u2014 a fact that first-rate physicists working\nat industrial laboratories discovered at APS meetings, when no one showed\ninterest in the results of their research on optics, acoustics, and polymer\nscience. It should come as no surprise that, between 1915 and 1930, physicists\nwere among the leading organizers of the Optical Society of America (now\nOptica), the Acoustical Society of America, and the Society of Rheology.\n\nThat acousticians were given a cold shoulder at early APS meetings is\nparticularly odd. At the time, acoustics research was not uncommon in American\nphysics departments. Harvard University, for example, employed five professors\nwho worked extensively in acoustics between 1919 and 1950. World War II\nmotivated the U.S. Navy to sponsor a great deal of acoustics research, and\nmany physics departments responded quickly. In 1948, the University of Texas\nhired three acousticians as assistant professors of physics. Brown University\nhired six physicists between 1942 and 1952, creating an acoustics powerhouse\nthat ultimately trained 62 physics doctoral students.\n\nThe acoustics landscape at Harvard changed abruptly in 1946, when all teaching\nand research in the subject moved from the physics department to the newly\ncreated department of engineering sciences and applied physics. In the years\nafter, almost all Ph.D. acoustics programs in the country migrated from\nphysics departments to \u201cnot physics\u201d departments.\n\nThe reason for this was explained by Cornell University professor Robert Fehr\nat a 1964 conference on acoustics education. Fehr pointed out that engineers\nlike himself exploited the fundamental knowledge of acoustics learned from\nphysicists to alter the environment for specific applications. Consequently,\nit made sense that research and teaching in acoustics passed from physics to\nengineering.\n\nIt took less than two decades for acoustics to go from being physics to \u201cnot\nphysics.\u201d But other fields have gone the opposite direction \u2014 a prime example\nbeing cosmology.\n\nAlbert Einstein applied his theory of general relativity to the cosmos in\n1917. However, his work generated little interest because there was no\nempirical data to which it applied. Edwin Hubble\u2019s work on extragalactic\nnebulae appeared in 1929, but for decades, there was little else to constrain\nmathematical speculations about the physical nature of the universe. The\ntheoretical physicists Freeman Dyson and Steven Weinberg have both used the\nphrase \u201cnot respectable\u201d to describe how cosmology was seen by physicists\naround 1960. The subject was simply \u201cnot physics.\u201d\n\nThis began to change in 1965 with the discovery of thermal microwave radiation\nthroughout the cosmos \u2014 empirical evidence of the nearly 20-year-old Big Bang\nmodel. Physicists began to engage with cosmology, and the percentage of U.S.\nphysics departments with at least one professor who published in the field\nrose from 4% in 1964 to 15% in 1980. In the 1980s, physicists led the\nsatellite mission to study the cosmic microwave radiation, and particle\nphysicists \u2014 realizing that the hot early universe was an ideal laboratory to\ntest their theories \u2014 became part-time cosmologists. Today, it\u2019s hard to find\na medium-to-large sized physics department that does not list cosmology as a\nresearch specialty.\n\nNot all disciplines have had such clean paths in or out of physics. Consider\nthe case of biophysics, or biological physics \u2014 where physicists apply their\nmethods to the study of living systems. Whether or not this field is physics\nor \u201cnot physics\u201d has vexed the community for a century.\n\nIn 1920, the physics department at Harvard boldly hired an assistant professor\nnamed William Bovie to conduct research and teach courses in biophysics. Bovie\ndid not get tenure, and the Harvard physics department did not hire another\nassistant professor in this area until 2013.\n\nIn 1970, the National Academy of Sciences charged the American physics\ncommunity with analyzing itself to help the government establish funding\npriorities. The resulting 2,900-page report devoted only 20 pages to what it\ncalled \u201cphysics in biology.\u201d Tenured appointments for younger people working\nin biophysics \u201chave been very scarce,\u201d it noted. \u201cAmong the reasons for this\nscarcity are the difficulty evaluating their work in a physics department and\nquestions about the appropriateness of such work in a physics department.\u201d\n\nThis may explain why, in 2000, only 20% of Ph.D.-granting institutions\nemployed at least one physics professor engaged in biophysical research. But\nalso in 2000, six physics departments had biophysics groups with more than\nthree faculty members each, and three of those groups boasted a record of\ncontinuous funding and publication beginning before 1965.\n\nSince 2000, the advent of conferences and federal funding devoted to\nbiological physics convinced a growing number of physics departments to accept\nit as a legitimate and exciting subfield of physics. On the other hand,\nseveral prominent U.S. physics departments remain biophysics-free in 2024. It\nappears that a juror or two must be convinced before a unanimous verdict can\nbe announced.\n\nPerhaps the path of each field \u2014 acoustics, cosmology, and biological physics\n\u2014 toward physics or \u201cnot physics\u201d seems unique. But all three are archetypes\nof stories that could be told about virtually every other subfield of physics.\nTo hear the tale of another discipline, simply question its suitability as a\npart of physics the next time you share a meal with one of its practitioners.\n\nAndrew Zangwill is a professor of physics at the Georgia Institute of\nTechnology.\n\nThis article was adapted from a talk the author gave at the 2024 March Meeting\nin Minneapolis, during a session on APS\u2019s 125-year history.
