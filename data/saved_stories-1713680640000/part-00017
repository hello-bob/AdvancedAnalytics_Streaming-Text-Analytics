However, the spinal cord can actually\nlearn and remember movements on its own.\n\nA team of researchers at the Leuven-based Neuro-Electronics Research Flanders\n(NERF) details how two different neuronal populations enable the spinal cord\nto adapt and recall learned behavior in a way that is completely independent\nof the brain. These remarkable findings, published in the journal Science,\nshed new light on how spinal circuits might contribute to mastering and\nautomating movement. The insights could prove relevant in the rehabilitation\nof people with spinal injuries.\n\n#### The spinal cord\u2019s puzzling plasticity\n\nThe spinal cord modulates and finetunes our actions and movements by\nintegrating different sources of sensory information, and it can do so without\ninput from the brain. What\u2019s more, nerve cells in the spinal cord can learn to\nadjust various tasks autonomously, given sufficient repetitive practice. How\nthe spinal cord achieves this remarkable plasticity, however, has puzzled\nneuroscientists for decades.\n\nOne such neuroscientist is Professor Aya Takeoka. Her team at Neuro-\nElectronics Research Flanders (NERF, a research institute backed by imec, KU\nLeuven, and VIB) studies how the spinal cord recovers from injuries by\nexploring how the nerve connections are wired, and how they function and\nchange when we learn new movements.\n\n\u201cAlthough we have evidence of \u2018learning\u2019 within the spinal cord from\nexperiments dating back as early as the beginning of the 20th century, the\nquestion of which neurons are involved and how they encode this learning\nexperience has remained unanswered,\u201d says Prof. Takeoka.\n\nPart of the problem is the difficulty in directly measuring the activity of\nindividual neurons in the spinal cord in animals that are not sedated but\nawake and moving. Takeoka\u2019s team took advantage of a model in which animals\ntrain specific movements within minutes. In doing so, the team uncovered a\ncell type-specific mechanism of spinal cord learning.\n\n#### Two specific neuronal cell types\n\nTo check how the spinal cord learns, doctoral researcher Simon Lavaud and his\ncolleagues at the Takeoka lab built an experimental setup to measure changes\nin movement in mice, inspired by methods used in insect studies. \u201cWe evaluated\nthe contribution of six different neuronal populations and identified two\ngroups of neurons, one dorsal and one ventral, that mediate motor learning.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese two sets of neurons take turns,\u201d explains Lavaud. \u201cThe dorsal neurons\nhelp the spinal cord learn a new movement, while the ventral neurons help it\nremember and perform the movement later.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can compare it to a relay race within the spinal cord. The dorsal neurons\nact like the first runner, passing on the critical sensory information for\nlearning. Then, the ventral cells take the baton, ensuring the learned\nmovement is remembered and executed smoothly.\u201d\n\n#### Learning and memory outside the brain\n\nThe detailed results, published in Science, illustrate that neuronal activity\nin the spinal cord resembles various classical types of learning and memory.\nFurther unraveling these learning mechanisms will be crucial, as they likely\ncontribute to different ways in which we learn and automate movement, and may\nalso be relevant in the context of rehabilitation, says Prof. Aya Takeoka:\n\u201cThe circuits we described could provide the means for the spinal cord to\ncontribute to movement learning and long-term motor memory, which both help us\nto move, not only in normal health but especially during recovery from brain\nor spinal cord injuries.\u201d\n\nReference: \u201cTwo inhibitory neuronal classes govern acquisition and recall of\nspinal sensorimotor adaptation\u201d by Simon Lavaud, Charlotte Bichara, Mattia\nD\u2019Andola, Shu-Hao Yeh and Aya Takeoka, 11 April 2024, Science.
