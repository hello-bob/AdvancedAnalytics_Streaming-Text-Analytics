Palm did them best.\n\nArs Contributors - 4/25/2024, 11:00 AM\n\nEnlarge\n\nAurich Lawson\n\n#### reader comments\n\n39\n\n\u201cGadgets aren\u2019t fun anymore,\u201d sighed my wife, watching me tap away on my Palm\nZire 72 as she sat on the couch with her MacBook Air, an iPhone, and an Apple\nWatch.\n\nAnd it\u2019s true: The smartphone has all but eliminated entire classes of\ngadgets, from point-and-shoot cameras to MP3 players, GPS maps, and even\nflashlights. But arguably no style of gadget has been so thoroughly superseded\nas the personal digital assistant, the handheld computer that dominated the\nlate '90s and early 2000s. The PDA even set the template for how its\nsmartphone successors would render it obsolete, moving from simple personal\ninformation management to encompass games, messaging, music, and photos.\n\nBut just as smartphones would do, PDAs offered a dizzying array of operating\nsystems and applications, and a great many of them ran Palm OS. (I bought my\nfirst Palm, an m505, new in 2001, upgrading from an HP 95LX.) Naturally,\nthere\u2019s no way we could enumerate every single such device in this article. So\nin this Ars retrospective, we\u2019ll look back at some notable examples of the\ntechnical evolution of the Palm operating system and the devices that ran\nit\u2014and how they paved the way for what we use now.\n\nEnlarge / You never forget your first(s). Here were my Palms from back in the\nday, my original m505, and later, my first Zire 72. They\u2019re beat up, but with\nnew batteries, they still work great.\n\nCameron Kaiser\n\n## When Zoom(er) wasn\u2019t meeting software\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1980s, portable computing primarily meant either heavy,\nluggable workstations or a unique class of pocket computers with tiny screens,\nsmall memories, and calculator-like keyboards. Jeff Hawkins, then vice\npresident of research at portable systems builder GRiD, thought he could do\nbetter. He wanted to build a system where the screen itself becomes the input\ndevice, replacing keyboards with pens and styluses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile handwriting recognition was an even bigger challenge for systems back\nthen, Hawkins\u2019 PalmPrint system simplified the task by merely matching strokes\nto characters instead of trying to recognize entire words. PalmPrint became\nGridPen, the core of the 1989 GriDPad 1900, or what we would call today the\nfirst commercially successful tablet computer. Using a resistive 10-inch\nblack-and-white LCD as the screen and writing surface, it ran MS-DOS on a\nlower-power 10 MHz Intel 80C86 and weighed just about two kilograms (4.5\npounds), selling at an MSRP of $2,500 (about $6,200 in 2024 dollars).\n\nThe GriDPad line went on to be very successful for GRiD, but Hawkins\nincreasingly considered his own creation to be too bulky and expensive.\nSurveying existing GriDPad corporate customers about a portable machine they\nwould personally use, the feedback was unanimous: It had to be a lot lighter,\na lot smaller, and under a cool grand.\n\nGRiD itself wasn\u2019t interested in producing a low-end mass-market device, but\nsuch a unit was well within the market range of Tandy Corporation, GRiD\u2019s\nparent since 1988 and the owners of Radio Shack. Tandy management was\nentranced by the concept of what Hawkins called the \u201cZoomer,\u201d so much so that\nthe company was willing to invest $300,000 in Hawkins\u2019 new venture to develop\nit, which he called Palm Computing.\n\nHawkins selected GeoWorks\u2019 PC/GEOS as the operating system based on its proven\nability to run on inexpensive hardware, and Tandy brought on longtime partner\nCasio (also a major pocket computer manufacturer) as the new device\u2019s OEM. To\nmanage the growing company, Hawkins hired Apple-Claris alumnus Donna Dubinsky\nas CEO and later Ed Colligan as VP of marketing, fresh from Macintosh\nperipherals maker Radius.\n\nEnlarge / The Tandy Zoomer, here in the Casio Z-7000 OEM version.\n\nCameron Kaiser\n\nUnfortunately, the Zoomer\u2019s development became increasingly troubled due to\ncorporate interference and software churn, and although underclocking its\nx86-compatible CPU to 7 MHz dramatically extended its battery life, it also\nmade the unit slow and ponderous. Still, the Zoomer got to market in October\n1993 at a pound in weight (less than half a kilogram) and for $599 ($1,240 in\n2024), markedly undercutting Apple\u2019s Newton MessagePad. On the other hand, it\nwas still too large and was basically treated (and judged) as a PC, and even\nthough its handwriting recognition was better than the Newton\u2019s, it was still\noutsold four to one.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n39\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Channel Ars Technica\n\n#### SITREP: F-16 replacement search a signal of F-35 fail?\n\nFootage courtesy of Dvids, Boeing, and The United States Navy.\n\n  * ##### SITREP: F-16 replacement search a signal of F-35 fail?\n\n  * ##### Sitrep: Boeing 707\n\n  * ##### Steve Burke of GamersNexus Reacts To Their Top 1000 Comments On YouTube\n\n  * ##### Scott Manley Reacts To His Top 1000 YouTube Comments\n\n  * ##### LGR's Clint Basinger Reacts To His Top 1000 YouTube Comments\n\n  * ##### How Forza's Racing AI Uses Neural Networks To Evolve\n\n  * ##### The F-35's next tech upgrade\n\n  * ##### Fighter Pilot Breaks Down Every Button in an F-15 Cockpit\n\n  * ##### Linus \"Tech Tips\" Sebastian Reacts to His Top 1000 YouTube Comments\n\n  * ##### Customizing Mini 4WD Racers For High Speeds On A Small Scale\n\n  * ##### MegaBots: Born to Smash Anything in Their Path\n\n  * ##### First Look: Xbox Adaptive Controller\n\n  * ##### Quantum Computing Expert Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Difficulty\n\n  * ##### Kids versus 80s tech: Game Boy, Vectrex and a stereo system\n\n  * ##### Expert Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Difficulty - Blockchain\n\n  * ##### Best wearable tech of 2017\n\n  * ##### The Moov HR Sweat - heart rate monitor in a headband | Ars Technica\n\nMore videos\n\n\u2190 Previous story Next story \u2192\n\n### Related Stories\n\n### Today on Ars\n\nCNMN Collection WIRED Media Group \u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
