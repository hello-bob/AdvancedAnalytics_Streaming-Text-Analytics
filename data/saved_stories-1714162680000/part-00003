Privacy of thoughts and the freedom to connect with\nour families, friends and communities directly, are the precious gifts of our\ndigital age.\n\nToday, we\u2019re taking a humble stride towards this goal by publicly debuting the\nfirst version of local-first sharing and collaboration within Anytype.\n\nWhen we were testing collaboration internally, we loved seeing the whole team\nedit the same page, even after switching off the Internet. It felt like magic\n- all communication was purely local and the changes happened in an instant.\n\nThis followed years of R&D into a network based on creator-owned keys, local-\nfirst collaboration, and end-to-end encryption. The combination of these\ntechnological choices allows creators to connect directly to each other and\nown what they create. Practically, such a network delivers the benefits of\noffline access, speedy loading times, and privacy and autonomy from software\nproviders.\n\n### We fondly refer to this as a \u2018no-one-in-between\u2019 network, where nobody\nmediates the connections between you and your data, your relationships, or\nyour devices.\n\nUnderlying this network structure is Anysync, our open-source protocol\ndesigned to support encrypted communication and collaboration at scale.\nAnysync combines on-device storage, P2P sync, and CRDTs to make it possible\nfor users to collaborate independently from the cloud.\n\nAnytype, our first product, is the interface to this network. Till now, it has\nbeen widely used as a tool for personal knowledge management. With the\nintroduction of multiplayer, we step out of personal and into the realm of\ncollaborative spaces, discussions, and communities with those you trust.\n\nWe\u2019ve added first ideas for spaces for families, communities, teams, neighbors\nand creators - this is how our own team has started to use multiplayer in\nAnytype.\n\nThis first version of collaboration is very basic - it\u2019s an alpha, and it\u2019s\nfar from polished. We will focus on making it complete by adding\nnotifications, public spaces, comments, and many other essential features in\nthe coming months.\n\n## How can you support?\n\n  1. First and foremost, we\u2019d love for you to try out collaboration.\n\nCreate a shared space and invite a family member, friend, or colleague to\nbuild it together with you.\n\nIf you need inspiration, you\u2019re welcome to check out some examples of how to\nuse shared spaces in our Experience Gallery. We\u2019ve added first ideas for\nspaces for families, communities, teams, neighbors and creators - these are\nhow our team has started to play with multiplayer.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve tried it for yourself, leave us your feedback! Let us and the rest\nof the Anytype community know what you\u2019d love to see next, and what challenges\nyou\u2019ve faced.\n\n  2. If you\u2019re enjoying this experience, upgrade your membership to a Builder or Co-Creator plan.

Tag @anytypelabs and we\u2019ll be sure to repost!\n\n## What comes next?\n\nToday\u2019s release marks just the beginning of our multiplayer journey, and we\u2019re\nexcited to evolve this into a comprehensive and engaging experience. The\ncurrent iteration supports small groups, providing a foundation for\ncollaboration and communication.\n\nMoving forward, we aim to enrich these interactions by introducing new types\nof spaces tailored for larger groups, such as creators and communities.\nEssential features like notifications, comments, and discussions will be\nintegrated into all spaces to enhance connectivity and engagement. Our team\nwill continue refining the overall user experience to ensure it meets your\nexpectations and needs.\n\nWe deeply appreciate your continued support and companionship on this journey.\nWe are blessed to work together with you to shape this new, networked era of\nAnytype.\n\n## Sign up for more like this\n\nEnter your email\n\nSubscribe\n\nFeatured\n\n## The Internet as our Nervous System: from Cloud to Local-first\n\nImagine for a moment that you, and all of the people around you, are single\nneurons.\n\nApr 17, 2024 6 min read\n\n## March Community Update\n\nMarch was a big month for the Anyteam: from releasing web clipper and files-\nas-objects, to revealing of our inaugural Memberships plan in our largest-ever\nTown Hall, and our official launch of the Android app in the Play Store.\n\nApr 9, 2024 4 min read\n\nFeatured\n\n## Our Membership Philosophy\n\nEach space and profile in the Anytype network is digitally independent.
