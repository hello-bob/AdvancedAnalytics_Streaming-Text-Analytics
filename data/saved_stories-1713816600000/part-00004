He compounded this by failing to disclose the existence of the\n> first loan he secured when his company went into liquidation.\n>\n> Tackling Bounce Back Loan misconduct is a key priority for the Insolvency\n> Service. The 13-year disqualification order made reflects the serious nature\n> of the breach of acceptable behaviour for any company director by\n> Jastrzebski and means he cannot be involved in the promotion, formation or\n> management of a company in the UK for that period.\n\nJastrzebski, whose last known address was Buxton Road, Luton, applied for two\nBounce Back Loans worth the maximum \u00a350,000 each in May 2020.\n\nHowever, E Marketing ceased trading just one month later and was liquidated in\nJuly 2021.\n\nJastrzebski did not inform insolvency practitioners of the existence of the\nfirst loan, which only came to light during investigations into his conduct by\nthe Insolvency Service.\n\nE Marketing failed to maintain adequate accounting records from its\nincorporation in October 2019 until liquidation.\n\nInvestigators were subsequently unable to confirm if the loans were used for\nthe economic benefit of the business.\n\nPayments of more than \u00a3500,000 to third parties between March 2020 and June\n2021 were also not explained by Jastrzebski.\n\nJastrzebski did not contest the proceedings and was not present at the final\ndisqualification hearing.\n\n## Further information\n\n  * Syzmon Jastrzebski was last of Buxton Road, Luton. His date of birth is 29 August 1999\n  * E Marketing Ltd (company number 12268427)\n  * Individuals subject to a disqualification order are bound by a range of restrictions\n  * Further information about the work of the Insolvency Service, and how to complain about financial misconduct.\n\n## Share this page\n\nThe following links open in a new tab\n\n  * Share on Facebook (opens in new tab)\n  * Share on Twitter (opens in new tab)\n\nPublished 18 April 2024\n\n## Is this page useful?\n\n  * Maybe\n\nThank you for your feedback\n\n## Services and information\n\n  * Benefits\n  * Births, death, marriages and care\n  * Business and self-employed\n  * Childcare and parenting\n  * Citizenship and living in the UK\n  * Crime, justice and the law\n  * Disabled people\n  * Driving and transport\n  * Education and learning\n  * Employing people\n  * Environment and countryside\n  * Housing and local services\n  * Money and tax\n  * Passports, travel and living abroad\n  * Visas and immigration\n  * Working, jobs and pensions\n\n## Government activity\n\n  * Departments\n  * News\n  * Guidance and regulation\n  * Research and statistics\n  * Policy papers and consultations\n  * Transparency\n  * How government works\n  * Get involved\n\n## Support links\n\n  * Help\n  * Privacy\n  * Cookies\n  * Accessibility statement\n  * Contact\n  * Terms and conditions\n  * Rhestr o Wasanaethau Cymraeg\n  * Government Digital Service\n\nAll content is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0, except where\notherwise stated\n\n\u00a9 Crown copyright\n\n", "frontpage": false}
