Conduktor 2.0 sets a new course towards success for teams\nand organizations by demystifying the complexities that are commonly\nassociated with Apache Kafka.\n\nConduktor is the only platform dedicated to promoting better collaboration\nbetween Platform Teams, Architects and Developers.\n\n### Making everyone successful with Apache Kafka\n\nFrom today, we are opening our free tier to make most features accessible,\nremoving prior limits, and providing some security features to get started. In\ndoing so, we aim to provide everything that you and your team need to adopt\nConduktor long-term, regardless of your data streaming maturity. The beginning\nof the journey is critical, and we believe you\u2019ll be in good hands with us.\n\nAs your needs evolve and demand for more sophisticated solutions arise, rest\nassured, Conduktor will be ready to support your journey into the broader\nexpanse of data streaming solutions.\n\nToday\u2019s announcement marks our ongoing commitment to serving our roots, the\ndeveloper community.\n\n\u201cAll developers working with Kafka need access to essential tooling to debug,\ntroubleshoot and monitor their streaming applications. Regardless of whether\nthey\u2019re a hobbyist, working at a scale-up or within a large Enterprise.\u201d\n\n### Nicolas Orban\n\nCEO\n\nConduktor is a vendor-agnostic solution, meaning it supports all managed and\nself-hosted Kafka implementations, both cloud and on-premise.\n\nOur north star has always been to accelerate the adoption of data streaming,\nand Conduktor 2.0 represents the next chapter.\n\n## Conduktor 2.0\n\n## Collaborative Kafka Development Platform\n\nIt\u2019s been an exciting ride since the general availability of Console 18 months\nago, which has since seen 15 releases that maximize the developer experience,\ncreating the ultimate control plane for managing your Kafka resources and its\ndata.\n\nAdditionally, the Conduktor platform now incorporates an innovative Kafka\nproxy to help secure streaming data and protect the Kafka infrastructure,\nproviding Platform teams and Architects greater controls over how Kafka is\nused inside an organization.\n\nAlongside that, we are today announcing a CLI to enable self-service of Kafka\nresources and promote cross-team data sharing through a GitOps approach.\n\n\u201cConduktor simplifies things; and we need this simplicity in our landscape. It\nhelps speed up our daily operations, and helps us with credit card data (PCI\nDSS) by encrypting the topics. Conduktor, in one sentence, for me, is Kafka\nmade simpler.\u201d\n\n### Marcos Rodriguez\n\nDomain Architect at Lufthansa\n\n## Visibility into Kafka in a secure, controlled environment\n\nWhile deploying applications using Kafka is relatively easy, troubleshooting\nthem and exploring your Kafka data is more difficult if you\u2019re not well-\nequipped.\n\nEver wondered if your application is lagging? Had to trace a missing orderId?\nRestart a failed Connect task? These are the sort of problems our Console will\nhelp you resolve in an instant.\n\nWorking on a unified platform that offers all essential tools leads to\nknowledge sharing, standardizes workflows, and facilitates collaboration,\nenabling developers and platform teams to build together more effectively.\n\nWe\u2019ve added a host of exciting features to improve the developer experience on\nKafka, and bring greater control to platform administrators in Console.\n\n#### User experience\n\nRicher controls to personalize your experience and bring in the metrics that\nmatter most to you through interactive data tables\n\n#### Performance on large clusters\n\nIndex metadata to limit making many AdminClient calls to Kafka. This is\nparticularly efficient on customers with 1000s of developers and 1TB+ topics!\n\n#### Drill deep into the topic data\n\nAdvanced filtering techniques to help you find a needle in a haystack. JSON,\nAvro, Protobuf, custom deserializer, we cover it all to speed up data\nexploration.\n\n#### CLI, APIs & Automation\n\nManage users, groups, permissions and Kafka resources via the Console REST API\nor Conduktor CLI. Developers will thank you for having Kafka Connect auto-\nrestart.\n\n#### Going beyond basic ACLs: RBAC\n\nDon\u2019t want Kafka to be an open bar? RBAC has you covered, moving beyond ACLs\n(topics and consumers only) and enabling Platform teams to manage permissions\nfor all Kafka resources at user and group level.\n\n#### Embedded Monitoring & Alerting\n\nPrometheus? Grafana? Datadog? JMX? What should the dashboards look like? No\nmore thinking. Conduktor Monitoring works out of the box with no agent\ndependency.\n\nDeploy Console in minutes using Docker, Kubernetes or CloudFormation.\n\n## Automate processes and democratize data with Kafka Self-Serve\n\nKafka usage spreads like wildfire (in a good way!). One successful project\nsparks interest and use cases amongst other teams, keen to improve their\ndecision-making and not be left behind.\n\nBut as streaming spreads across different teams and business units, how do you\navoid the central Platform team becoming a bottleneck?\n\nConduktor\u2019s Self-Service solution simplifies and automates processes,\nfacilitating better collaboration between Platform teams and Application teams\nthrough a GitOps approach.\n\n#### So, how does it all work?\n\nWell, we love the idea of Platform teams sipping cocktails on the beach, and\nnot sat approving every PR for new Kafka resources or a change in partitions.\n\nPlatform teams define the rules of the game, enforcing naming conventions and\nrestricting expensive configurations. This permits ownership to be delegated\nto Application teams, who are free to create and manage their own domain data\nin a safe, controlled environment via UI, GitOps, or CLI.\n\nBeyond that, we also want to solve the challenge of discovering, and sharing,\nyour domain data with other teams to provide a self-service approach and drive\ndata innovation. So once a team is granted ownership, they now have\npermissions to grant access to other teams, without involving the central\nPlatform team.\n\nThat sounds like a better way of working, right!\n\nRead more\n\nBook a personalized demo\n\n## New ways to secure and govern the streaming data plane\n\nKafka is easy to get started, but in the beginning, security is not a primary\nconcern and neither is how to govern your environment.\n\nBut as the ecosystem grows, so too does the number of teams and domains to\nonboard, the number of streaming applications and the volume of data to\nregulate. The integration complexity is increasing, you have to support more\nlanguages, and build more client SDKs to support your organizational\nconstraints. Before long, your company is pedalling backwards, trying to\nimplement bespoke solutions to paper over the cracks.\n\nSolving these growing pains is the DNA behind Conduktor.\n\nAt Conduktor, we have a unique way of protecting your whole Kafka\ninfrastructure, no matter your Kafka provider. We have built an enterprise-\nhardened Kafka proxy which is fully Kafka-wire compatible. This permits\ncompanies to strengthen their security posture on Kafka like never before, and\ndrive scalable processes to maximize operational efficiency.\n\nThis powerful architectural framework offers functionality that is not\navailable natively with Apache Kafka.\n\n### The new way of working with Kafka\n\n#### End-to-End Encryption\n\nWithout any client-side change, encrypt full Kafka payload or specific fields.\nIntegrate with any KMS, to ensure your data is encrypted both in transit and\nat rest. Regulations.\n\n#### Safeguard your Kafka\n\nPrevent the most common Kafka mistakes and undesirable client configurations\n(compression, acks, ...). Enforce best practices to ensure the availability of\nyour data and protect your Kafka infrastructure (connection rates, throttling,\nschemas, overcommit...)\n\n#### Elevate your Data Quality\n\nValidating data types with a Schema Registry is nice but what about the data\ntype constraints? (minimum, maximum, patterns, formats etc.). Prevent poor\ndata in Kafka.\n\n#### Virtual Clusters over Physical Clusters\n\nTurn a single cluster into many isolated, secure, virtual clusters for a\nunique approach to multi-tenancy to simplify your security and maximize your\ninfrastructure usage.\n\n#### SQL Topics at no cost\n\nWe all know SQL. Create virtual topics through SQL statements for simple\nprojections that don\u2019t warrant complex pipelines and cost absolutely $0.\n\n#### Cache your data\n\nKafka is immutable. Eliminate latency and data duplication by caching data at\nthe edge, near your Point of Presence (PoP). Crucial for efficient global\noperations.\n\nDemos\n\nBook a personalized demo\n\n## The Next Chapter: Embracing Data Mesh\n\nManaging Kafka infrastructure is a solved problem handled by leading experts\nin the industry. But Kafka itself is not enough to succeed. Within an\norganization, the focus is about delivering projects and democratizing real-\ntime data to maximize its benefits. This requires connecting individuals,\nimplementing processes, and enforcing policies. This remains a significant\nhurdle.\n\nThis is what the Data Mesh principles are highlighting. At Conduktor, our\nfocus for the upcoming years will be to intensify efforts in these areas. We\naim to democratize data access across the organization, promote self-service,\nand assist in implementing a federated governance model to maintain control.\n\nData streaming isn't going anywhere. Real-time applications and services are\nwhat makes a business competitive and help to provide a great customer\nexperience. Our mission is to accelerate how enterprises get there\nefficiently.\n\n## Maximizing Kafka & Conduktor Impact with our trusted partners\n\nConduktor collaborates closely with leading solution integrators, ensuring our\nclients benefit from optimal usage and best practices.
