He was standing alone in a virtual novelty store in Second\nLife, where he had recently been fired. The rabbit, the shop owner explained\nto me later, was meant to be a clerk, \u201cbut he kept trying to sell items that\nwere not for sale.\u201d (AI, after all, has a tendency to make things up.) So the\nrabbit had been demoted to the role of greeter, chatting with customers about\nthe nature of comedy, his own existence, or whatever else they cared to ask.\n\nBunnyGPT is among the first bots in the virtual world to have its \u201cmind\u201d wired\nto OpenAI\u2019s large language model. It\u2019s an example of how Second Life, which is\ncelebrating its 20th anniversary, continues to evolve, with a community that\ntaps into new technologies for its own oddball purposes. Nothing else is quite\nlike it\u2014Second Life is neither exactly a social network nor really a\nconventional game, which has both limited its mainstream appeal and ensured\nits longevity. To this day, tens of thousands of people are logged in at any\ngiven time, inhabiting a digital world that\u2019s more original than the corporate\nversions of virtual existence being offered by Meta and Apple.\n\nThe reasons for the virtual world\u2019s longevity are as paradoxical as they are\ninspiring, especially in this moment when traditional social media seems to be\ncollapsing in on itself, or flailing for new relevance, even as the rise of\ngenerative AI promises an uncertain, discomfiting future. Developed by a\ncompany named Linden Lab, Second Life was inspired in part by the metaverse as\nfirst described with biblical specificity in Neal Stephenson\u2019s cyberpunk\nclassic Snow Crash: a massive virtual world created by its users and connected\nto the real-world economy. Countless technologists who began their career in\nthe 1990s were also inspired by that novel. But Linden\u2019s charismatic founder,\nPhilip Rosedale, added to this geeky conception a distinctly bohemian muse:\nBurning Man, the orgiastic art festival held every year in Nevada\u2019s Black Rock\nDesert.\n\nRead: The digital ruins of a forgotten future\n\n\u201cI was just blown away by the fact that I was willing to talk to anyone,\u201d\nRosedale once told me, remembering his time on the playa, \u201cthat it had this\nmystical quality that demolished the barriers between people. And I thought\nabout it: What magical quality makes that happen?\u201d Rosedale believed that\nallowing users to create their own content, along with highly customizable\navatars, would also evoke a similar sense of serendipity.\n\nSnow Crash\n\nBy Neal Stephenson\n\nFor its first three years, Linden Lab contracted me to be the virtual world\u2019s\nofficial \u201cembedded journalist\u201d\u2014a roving reporter using a digital avatar in a\nwhite suit (my pretentious tribute to Tom Wolfe), impertinently asking members\nof the early user community about their virtual lives\u2014ambitious collective art\nprojects, savvy business ventures, the pixel sex they were having with the\nattachable genitals they inevitably created.\n\nRosedale\u2019s dream of merging the metaverse with Burning Man succeeded beyond\nany reasonable expectation. I\u2019m always stunned to scroll through my blog, to\nreview the people I met in Second Life as avatars. I\u2019ve talked to an Iraqi\narts professor who excitedly logged into Second Life through his sputtering,\npostwar internet connection from the ancient city of Babylon; a Jewish\nAmerican woman who, with the help of her daughter, began logging into the\nvirtual world to give lectures about surviving the Holocaust; a young Japanese\nsex worker who, in between porn shoots, created in Second Life an eerie\nmemorial to the nuking of Hiroshima; the conceptual artist Cao Fei, who\ncreated an entire city in Second Life, and then\u201415 years before NFT mania\u2014sold\nvirtual real-estate deeds for her digital metropolis to bemused patrons at Art\nBasel.\n\nMany of the profiles I wrote about avatars occurred by pure happenstance.\nRandomly visiting a virtual Bayou bar one day, I saw an avatar playing blues\nguitar, his appearance customized to look like a tall old Black man. Clicking\non the user\u2019s account, I realized that in real life he was Charles Bristol, an\n87-year-old bluesman and the grandson of once-enslaved people, who\u2019d lived\nlong enough to play live music in the metaverse.\n\nStill, despite this miraculous diversity\u2014or perhaps because of it\u2014mainstream\nadoption of Second Life remains elusive. The utopian ideals that contributed\nto Second Life\u2019s longevity as an online community may also have relegated it\nto a niche platform. To encourage as much free-form user creativity as\npossible, Linden Lab adamantly refused to market Second Life as a game. That\neffectively made the virtual world uninviting to gamers (who subsequently\nmoved on to Minecraft and other popular sandbox games), while leaving new\nusers confused and adrift. At the same time, this lack of consumer\ncategorization excited a disparate coterie of academics, artists, and other\nnonconformists who became regular denizens of Second Life\u2014but who might have\nrefused to join had it been positioned as a mere video game.\n\nThe utopian paradox even extends into how Second Life was developed by\nemployees at Linden Lab. Under the idealistic direction of Rosedale and his\nCTO, Cory Ondrejka, the start-up operated with a no-managers, \u201cchoose your own\nwork\u201d policy, cheekily dubbed the \u201cTao of Linden.\u201d Their creativity thus\nunleashed, Linden developers wound up adding a farrago of persnickety features\nto the product with little unifying direction that might create a seamless,\nuser-friendly experience. To this day, the Second Life application resembles a\nmassively multiplayer online game welded to a 3-D-graphics editor duct-taped\nto a social network crammed into an ancient television remote with infinite\nbuttons.\n\nBut the program\u2019s very complexity became a kind of initiation rite. Some 99\npercent of new users would quit, overwhelmed and aggravated, most within their\nfirst hour in the virtual world. Those who stayed long enough to learn how to\nuse the software\u2014usually guided by a patient \u201coldie\u201d community member\u2014found\nthemselves welcomed into an exclusive club. Second Life quickly became a small\nenchanted city with an eccentric but charming citizenry, surrounded by a\nbrutal desert that few dared cross. Linden Lab, in other words, had\ninadvertently re-created the Burning Man experience a bit too thoroughly.\n\nRead: The age of goggles has arrived\n\nUsing the world\u2019s 3-D creation and coding tools, the community quickly built a\nveritable multiverse of items and experiences spanning nearly every\nconceivable genre and avenue of human interest (an evening gown made of\nfishhooks; a self-generating steampunk city in the sky; a tesseract house with\nno beginning or end). And because users could also sell their creations in\nSecond Life and exchange the world\u2019s virtual currency for USD, thousands of\nlocal 3-D artisans created successful small businesses, many of them servicing\nthe sprawling avatar-fashion industry. The most well-known Second Life\u2013based\nbrands took on celebrity status; at the very high end, grassroots creators in\nthis and other virtual worlds pulled in millions of dollars. It also created\nanother reason for staying: Long-term Second Life fashionistas typically have\nspent many thousands of dollars on virtual fashion items in their inventory.\n\nAlongside all that commerce and creativity, I noticed the rise of powerful\nsubcommunities in Second Life that would be difficult to replicate in the real\nworld, or even with traditional social media. The trans community, for\nexample, is remarkably large in the virtual world, comprising about 500\nregistered groups, people from around the globe in search of a secure place to\nexhibit their identity; some are so battered by transphobia in their offline\nlives that they save expressions of their full self for the gender\ncustomizations of their Second Life avatars. And as the U.S. conflicts in Iraq\nand Afghanistan wound down, I started noticing military veterans\u2014separated by\ndistance, social pressure, and battle wounds\u2014informally meeting together as\navatars to discuss their PTSD and other painful topics. As the director of a\nveteran-support organization once put it: \u201cI know Marines that say that Second\nLife is working when nothing else has.\u201d\n\nThey are not alone. I\u2019ve seen similar communities spring up in many other,\nnewer virtual worlds. By my estimate, more than 500 million people are active\ncommunity members within platforms that roughly fit what Stephenson described\nin Snow Crash\u2014especially VRChat, a kind of next-generation successor to Second\nLife. Many of these metaverse communities may have a longevity similar to\nSecond Life\u2019s, thriving apart from the algorithmic sirens of social media and\nthe reckless growth of generative AI. We may briefly enjoy conversing with\nChatGPT-powered bunnies, but ultimately we yearn to connect with real humans\nbehind the avatars we meet.\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.
