But when\nyou\u2019re hit by an infection, fungi can be thrown out of equilibrium with other\norganisms inside you, leading to a more severe infection and other symptoms of\nillness.\n\nFor this reason, the pandemic immediately set off alarms for Iliyan Iliev, an\nimmunologist at Weill Cornell Medical School. \u201cWe were thinking, the first\nthing that\u2019s going to happen is people will start getting fungal co-\ninfections,\u201d he says. With the microbiome unbalanced, fungi might start\nrunning riot inside Covid patients, Iliev reasoned. His fears were soon\nrealized.\n\nIn research published in Nature Immunology, he and his team discovered that in\npatients with severe Covid, certain strains of gut fungi\u2014knocked off-kilter by\nthe virus\u2014set off a prolonged immune response that could last long after the\ninitial infection. This response potentially led to some of the respiratory\nsymptoms experienced by these patients. These results, Iliev says, point to\nthe critical role of the gut microbiome in the human immune response and could\nlead to better disease treatments down the line.\n\nImbalance of the gut microbiome has long been linked to disease. Ken Cadwell,\nan immunologist at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of\nPennsylvania, thinks of the microbiome as a metaphorical rainforest. \u201cIt\u2019s a\nnice ecosystem\u2014but if you cut down too many trees or bring in invasive\nspecies, you could make things go out of whack,\u201d he says.\n\nTo see how the body\u2019s internal fungi were affected during Covid and how this\ntriggered the immune system, Iliev and his team started by looking at\npatients\u2019 blood. After collecting samples from 91 people with Covid, they\nmeasured levels of antibodies against several fungi, to figure out if the\nbody\u2019s immune system was reacting against these. Significantly more anti-\nfungal antibodies, for instance, would indicate fungal overgrowth or invasion.\n\nTakato Kusakabe, a postdoctoral fellow in Iliev\u2019s lab and study author, ran\nplate after plate of experiments\u2014a painstaking process\u2014to quantify these\nantibody levels. The team found in patients with severe Covid, several fungi\ncommonly found in the gut had increased antibodies against them (in comparison\nto uninfected people). Notably, these included Candida albicans, which is a\ncommon culprit of yeast infections. When the team then ran tests on fecal\nsamples from 10 of the hospitalized Covid patients, these confirmed that the\nfungi being targeted by the antibodies were present in the patients\u2019 guts\u2014and\nat seemingly at higher levels than in uninfected controls, suggesting an\nimbalance in their microbiome.\n\nIliev recalls excitedly peering into the laboratory incubator to see the first\nround of fungal isolations. \u201cThe plate was full, with a lawn full of fungal\norganisms,\u201d he says.\n\nNow that they knew severe Covid was associated with an increase in certain gut\nfungi, the team wanted to figure out exactly how this would influence the\nbody\u2019s immune cells. It wasn\u2019t long before they found something out of the\nordinary\u2014certain neutrophils (a subtype of white blood cell that fights off\ninfection) were present in greater quantities in severe Covid patients\ncompared to those with mild or no disease.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nWe Finally Know Where Neuralink\u2019s Brain Implant Trial Is Happening\n\nEmily Mullin\n\n  * Business\n\nBitcoin Miners Brace for the \u2018Halving\u2019\u2014and Race to Cash In\n\nJoel Khalili\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 16 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nMatt Kamen\n\n  * Music\n\nNas\u2019 Illmatic Was the Beginning of the End of the Album\n\nC. Brandon Ogbunu\n\nWhen the team infected mice with Candida albicans strains taken from the\nseverely affected Covid patients, they discovered that the mice generated\nincreased fungal antibodies and neutrophils. And when they then treated these\ninfected mice with the common antifungal drug fluconazole, numbers of these\nfungal-induced neutrophils decreased\u2014as did the quantity of fungal antibodies.\nThis indicated that overgrowth of those fungi helped cause the number of\nneutrophils to rise, with the coronavirus itself kickstarting the process.\n\nNeutrophils are an important part of the immune system, says Iliev, but\nexcessive activity can lead to prolonged inflammation that is characteristic\nof Covid. \u201cNeutrophils will keep coming because they think there is\ninflammation and infection,\u201d he adds. \u201cThey basically start exploding to make\nthese structures called neutrophil extracellular traps\u2014which, instead of\nhelping you, actually makes the disease worse.\u201d\n\nAnd the impact of this fungal overgrowth didn\u2019t end once the patients\u2019 Covid\nhad subsided. By looking again at blood samples from the severe Covid\npatients, and comparing these to samples from healthy controls, the scientists\nfound that the stem cells that created these neutrophils had become\nspecifically adapted to target fungi. These stem cells were active long after\nthe initial infection, even after levels of fungal antibodies and neutrophils\nhad died down\u2014essentially priming the body to respond dramatically to a future\nfungal threat. At this stage, it\u2019s not clear if this would be helpful or\nproblematic for patients\u2014it\u2019s plausible that the patients\u2019 bodies might be\nprimed to overreact to other fungal infections in future.\n\nThere was one final question puzzling Iliev and his colleagues. How, then, did\nthe fungi nestled in the gut cause such drastic changes in the immune system\nlocated elsewhere\u2014all the way down to the stem cells? To answer that question,\nthe scientists looked for signaling molecules, known as cytokines. One of\nthese, called IL6, they noticed was elevated in the infected mice, alongside\nthe elevated neutrophils and fungal antibodies. When the team blocked IL6,\nboth the neutrophils and fungal antibodies decreased in quantity. \u201cMaybe the\nmediator here is a cytokine that the fungi induce,\u201d Iliev says, suggesting\nthat these are potentially the sign of some communication across the body that\nsets all of these processes in motion.\n\nThis complex crosstalk between the gut microbiome and the immune system is an\nexample of how most things in the body are intertwined, says Alessio Fasano, a\ngastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, who was unaffiliated\nwith the study. \u201cThe gut is not like Las Vegas,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat happens in the\ngut does not stay in the gut.\u201d\n\nFasano can envision this kind of work pointing to a future of more\npersonalized medicine. Measuring for increased levels of fungal antibodies in\nCovid patients, he says, could potentially uncover a subset of people who\nmight benefit from taking antifungal drugs like fluconazole.\n\nAll the scientists note, though, that it is unfair to assign the blame of\nupending the immune system to one single strain of fungi. Because the\nmicrobiome is always in flux, reestablishing balance after infection is\nkey\u2014throwing lots of antibiotics or antifungals at the problem can result in a\nnever-ending game of biological whack-a-mole where one imbalance leads to\nanother.\n\nNow, Iliev and Kusakabe are interested in exploring how fungal overgrowth may\nappear in long Covid\u2014and how immunity is affected. \u201cWhat\u2019s the impact of this\nreprogramming of the immune system by the fungus and the virus?\u201d Iliev asks.\n\u201cWhat happens long-term if you have suffered from that?\u201d\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * Navigate election season with our Politics Lab newsletter and podcast\n\n  * Think Google\u2019s \u201cIncognito mode\u201d protects your privacy?
