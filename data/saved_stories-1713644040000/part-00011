This is due to sequential grading biases and the default\norder of students\u2019 submissions in Canvas \u2014 the most widely used online\nlearning management system \u2014 which is based on alphabetical rank of their\nsurnames.\n\n##### more information\n\n  * 30 Million Canvas Grading Records Reveal Widespread Sequential Bias and System-Induced Surname Initial Disparity (Submitted for review)\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the researchers found, those alphabetically disadvantaged\nstudents receive comments that are notably more negative and less polite, and\nexhibit lower grading quality measured by post-grade complaints from students.\n\n\u201cWe spend a lot of time thinking about how to make the grading fair and\naccurate but even for me it was really surprising,\u201d said Jun Li, associate\nprofessor of technology and operations at the Stephen M. Ross School of\nBusiness. \u201cIt didn\u2019t occur to us until we looked at the data and realized that\nsequence makes a difference.\u201d\n\nLi co-authored the study with doctoral students Jiaxin Pei from the School of\nInformation and Helen (Zhihan) Wang from Ross. It is under review by the\njournal Management Science.\n\nThe researchers collected available historical data of all programs, students\nand assignments on Canvas from the fall 2014 semester to the summer 2022\nsemester. They supplemented the Canvas data with university registrar data,\nwhich contains detailed information about students\u2019 backgrounds, demographics\nand learning trajectories at the university.\n\nAlthough the data is from U-M, the researchers say the findings can be\ngeneralized across institutions and courses. They are driven by a common\ndesign issue of learning-management systems \u2014 the default setting of ranking\nstudents\u2019 assignments alphabetically by their names.\n\nTheir research uncovered a clear pattern of a decline in grading quality as\ngraders evaluate more assignments. Wang said students whose surnames start\nwith A, B, C, D or E received a 0.3-point higher grade out of 100 possible\npoints than compared with when they were graded randomly. Likewise, students\nwith later-in-the-alphabet surnames received a 0.3-point lower grade \u2014\ncreating a 0.6-point gap.\n\nWang noted that for a small group of graders (about 5%) that grade from Z to\nA, the grade gap flips as expected: A-E students are worse off, while W-Z\nstudents receive higher grades relative to what they would receive when graded\nrandomly. The researchers said such observations confirm their hypothesis that\nit\u2019s the order of grading that leads to the initial gap in grades.\n\nA 0.6-point difference might seem small, but such a disparity did affect\nstudents\u2019 course grade-point averages, which negatively influences\nopportunities in their respective career paths.\n\n\u201cOur conclusion is this may be something that happened unconsciously by the\ngraders that\u2019s actually creating a real social impact,\u201d Wang said.\n\nPei said the idea for the study came up during a discussion he had with Wang\nin which they were talking about their research: Wang studies educational\ntechnology and he studies artificial intelligence. He observed that a\nfundamental task of machine learning is data labeling, also a sequential task\nthat can be long and tedious, but one that is randomized.\n\nIt got them thinking about educational systems like Canvas and led to some\npilot studies to see if there was any disparity among grades based on the\namount of time spent in the task of grading.\n\n\u201cWe kind of suspect that fatigue is one of the major factors that is driving\nthis effect, because when you\u2019re working on something for a long period of\ntime, you get tired and then you start to lose your attention and your\ncognitive abilities are dropping,\u201d Pei said.\n\nThe researchers note the option exists to grade the assignments in a random\norder, and some educators do, but alphabetical order is the default mode in\nCanvas and other online learning-management systems. One simple fix would be\nto make random order the default setting.\n\nThey also suggest academic institutions could hire more graders for larger\nclasses, distribute the workload among more people or train them to be aware\nof and lessen the bias while grading.\n\nLi, Wang and Pei have been sharing their research at conferences and it\u2019s been\npositively received \u2014 many are impressed by their work although it confirms\nsuspicions many harbor. One reaction in particular stands out to Li, no doubt\nan information-age wrinkle on \u201cthe dog ate my homework\u201d excuse.\n\n\u201cA college student emailed us afterward asking us to share the paper with\nhim,\u201d she said. \u201cHe mentioned that his last name started with W. He\u2019s going to\ntell his parents it\u2019s not because of him \u2014 it\u2019s because of his last name.\u201d\n\nTags:\n\n    \n\n  * Canvas\n  * grading\n  * School of Information\n  * Stephen M.

For example, \u201c4 points for each part of this problem;\u201d \u201c-2 points for\nthis specific error.\u201d\n\n  2. ###### John Dinkel\n\non April 19, 2024 at 3:38 pm\n\nSo is this proof that students\u2019 work should not be graded in randumb order!\n\n### Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\n#### Today's Headlines\n\n  * Engineering professor Kamal Sarabandi receives Ellis Island Medal of Honor\n  * Twelve U-M faculty members named as AAAS fellows\n  * Support resources, insurance available for international travelers\n  * Chemicals stored in home garages linked to ALS risk\n  * Law student wins Soros Fellowship for New Americans\n  * Senate Assembly passes resolution regarding pay\u2010raise schedule\n  * Dearborn, Flint campuses announce commencement schedules\n\nMore Headlines\n\n  * About\n  * Contact\n  * Past Issues\n\nOffice of the Vice President for Communications \u00a9 2024 The Regents of the\nUniversity of Michigan\n\n  * Michigan Daily\n  * Michigan News\n  * Michigan Public\n  * Michigan Today\n  * Health System News\n  * Athletic News\n\nNotifications\n\nBy clicking \u201cAccept All\u201d, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device\nto enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing\nefforts.
