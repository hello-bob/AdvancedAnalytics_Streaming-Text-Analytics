For years, we have grown accustomed to issues with the CPI, due to\nthe constant moving of goalposts undertaken by the Bureau of Labor Statistics,\nthe agency. But now, it appears that the jobs are being manipulated as well,\nto portray the facade of a strong and booming economy, when the story is more\ncomplex beneath the surface.\n\nThe Dollar Endgame is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and\nsupport my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\nI first noticed this issue last year when the New York Post discovered that a\nmassive 439,000 jobs were quietly removed from last year\u2019s data up to November\n2023.\n\nIn August 2023, the Bureau of Labor Statistics had released an initial\nrevision covering the 12 months leading up to March 2023, revealing that U.S.\njob growth during that time was overstated by a net of 306,000 jobs. This\ntranslates to an average of 25,500 fewer jobs per month during that period.\n\nAnother interesting thing to note with the data- jobs are increasingly\ndisappearing from the private sector, and the areas of biggest growth are\ncoming from federal spending. In that same period, adjustments were made to\nprivate sector job creation, which was lowered by 358,000 jobs, while\ngovernment payrolls saw an increase of 52,000 jobs. Last September saw over\nhalf of all job growth tied to government agencies.\n\nEven more shocking, their own models doubt the veracity of the numbers. In\nDecember 2022, the employment algos of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank\nsuggested that the BLS had overestimated job growth by 1.1 million in the\nsecond quarter of that year.\n\nIn general, government statistics have always been slightly misleading,\nstretching the truth or softening an inconvenient downside miss. However, in\nthe past few years, things have gotten substantially worse. Economists are now\nreporting stellar numbers, beating expectations handily each month, only to\nrevise the figures down months later after the press has moved on to other\nmore current topics.\n\nMarketwatch points out:\n\n\u201cThe official U.S. employment reports chronically overstated how many jobs\nwere created each month in 2023, potentially misleading Wall Street, the\nFederal Reserve and Washington lawmakers about the true strength of the\neconomy.\n\nFrom January to October, the government initially overestimated job growth in\nnine of the 10 months. Eventually the employment gains were reduced by an\naverage of 55,000 a month, an unusually large change.\n\nTake last June as an extreme example. The government initially said a robust\n209,000 new jobs were created before marking its final estimate down to a\ntepid 105,000 two months later.\u201d\n\nA further point is the actual composition of job creation. Although even the\nrevised numbers appear to be strong, the jobs being created are not. The 2023\nhousehold employment survey showed a decrease in the overall number of\nemployed individuals. But, the number of part-time workers increased\nsignificantly, rising by 762,000. In contrast, the number of people in full-\ntime employment dropped by 1.6 million, marking the most severe decline in\nfull-time jobs since the Covid recession.\n\nI should mention there is a categorical difference between the two surveys.\nThe headline number typically reported by news outlets is from the\n\"establishment survey,\" which represents the total number of payroll positions\nrather than the total number of employed individuals. The household survey\nbasically involves interviewing individuals about their employment status. Due\nto some individuals holding multiple jobs, the total number of jobs can rise\neven if the number of employed people decreases.\n\nThe payroll numbers released by the BLS also show a similar story. Overall,\nthere appears to be job growth on the surface, but when we look under the\nhood, part time workers are increasing, while full-time employment keeps\nfalling. We are slowly becoming a gig economy- software engineers, lawyers,\nand product managers are being laid off and being replaced with Uber drivers\nand retail store associates. This isn\u2019t indicative of a healthy and thriving\nmarket.\n\nAnother report from the Labor Department, released in January, revealed an\nunexpected slowdown in job openings, with the number falling to 8.7 million by\nthe end of November. This is the lowest since March 2021, showing a decrease\nfrom the downwardly revised figure of 9.3 million openings reported the\nprevious month.\n\nAlthough this dip caught economists off guard, it aligns with recent data from\nthe employment website Indeed. As of December 29, open positions on the site\nhad decreased by more than 15% compared to a year earlier.\n\nAnd that doesn\u2019t even account for the layoffs.\n\nAnother way that the stats are manipulated is through the Unemployment Rate.\nCurrently, it sits at 3.8%, which is pretty low for historical standards. It\ndropped below 4% in January 2022 and hasn\u2019t gone above it since. Prior to the\npandemic, unemployment was in this range as well. So on the surface, it\nappears that the job market has fully recovered, right?\n\nThe real story is more complex. Unemployment is calculated as # of people\nlooking for work actively divided by the people available to work (workforce).\nThe government can change the denominator by artificially removing people from\nthe workforce, and claiming therefore that unemployment is falling since the\noverall labor pool has lessened.\n\nDaniel R. Amerman, CFA has laid this out beautifully in a post over a decade\nago concerning this exact issue. I recommend you go read the whole thing (it\nis long), but I will quote the first paragraphs of his piece here:\n\n> When we look at broad measures of jobs and population, then the beginning of\n> 2012 was one of the worst months in US history, with a total of 2.3 million\n> people losing jobs or leaving the workforce in a single month. Yet, the\n> official unemployment rate showed a decline from 8.5% to 8.3% in January -\n> and was such cheering news that it set off a stock rally.\n>\n> How can there be such a stark contrast between the cheerful surface and an\n> underlying reality that is getting worse?\n\n> The true unemployment picture is hidden by essentially splitting jobless\n> Americans up and putting them inside one of three different \"boxes\": the\n> official unemployment box, the full unemployment box, and the most obscure\n> box, the workforce participation rate box.\n>\n> As we will explore herein, a detailed look at the government's own database\n> shows that about 9 million people without jobs have been removed from the\n> labor force simply by the government defining them as not being in the labor\n> force anymore. Indeed - effectively all of the decreases in unemployment\n> rate percentages since 2009 have come not from new jobs, but through\n> reducing the workforce participation rate so that millions of jobless people\n> are removed from the labor force by definition.\n\nAs workforce participation falls, the unemployment rate falls, all else equal,\nsince you divide the same number of unemployed people by a smaller base. This\nmakes the numbers look stellar!\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics actually measures unemployment in six\ndifferent ways (talk about confusing!), from U-1 to U-6, with the U-6\nstatistic aggregating all categories of unemployment.\n\nSPONSOR: I\u2019ve talked a lot about the value of Bitcoin and its use case as fiat\ncurrencies inflate away. As such, I'm proud to have Onramp as a sponsor\nsupporting this newsletter, a firm at the forefront of pioneering a trust-\nminimized form of Bitcoin custody. With Onramp Multi-Institution Custody,\nassets live in a multi-sig vault controlled by three distinct entities, none\nof which have unilateral control.\n\nTo learn more about Onramp's products for individuals and institutions,\nconnect with their team or schedule a consultation.\n\nNow let\u2019s get back to it!\n\nThere\u2019s a large difference between the U-3 official unemployment rate and the\nU-6 comprehensive unemployment rate, particularly in how they account for\nlong-term unemployed individuals and those involuntarily working part-time. If\nyou've been jobless for an extended period, actively sought work without\nsuccess, and haven't recently applied for a job because you've already applied\neverywhere possible, the official U-3 measure no longer counts you as\nunemployed. You don\u2019t exist anymore.\n\nThe government reduces overall workforce participation by claiming that\nmillions of 20, 30 and 40 year olds are no longer looking for work, and all\nhope is lost for them to ever find a job. They even mention this on the BLS\u2019\nown website.\n\nWe can see this clearly in the falling workforce participation rate. The\ncurrent figure of 62.7% is truly abysmal, and you have to go back to December\n1977 (almost 50 years!) to find a similar number. Overall, we peaked in the\nlate 90s and early 2000s, and the number has been steadily declining ever\nsince. It\u2019s also key to note that the rate is currently below where it was at\npre-COVID, which is not something you would grasp if you were just looking at\nheadline unemployment rate (U2).\n\nNow, you might retort that this is due to the wave of baby boomers retiring,\nwhere 10,000 seniors are retiring every day, removing 3.6M people from the\nworkforce every year. That does sound plausible, until you look where the\nworkforce is shrinking (or what the BLS claims where it is shrinking).\n\nAgain, Daniel points this out in a graph from 2012:\n\nIf demographic shifts due to an aging population were influencing changes in\nlabor force participation rates, one would expect stable participation among\nthose under 50, with declines occurring among individuals in their 50s, 60s,\nand older. However, this is not the case as participation for 65+ individuals\nactually rose!\n\nThe largest percentage decrease in workforce participation has been among 16\nto 19-year-olds- they are now the group most often categorized as \"out of the\nworkforce\" by governmental definitions. By this definition, 1.8 million teens\ndropped out of the workforce in just a few years.\n\nInteresting right!\n\nJim Bianco pointed out on Twitter another incredible anomaly:\n\n> Below is the number of initial filings for unemployment insurance.\n>\n> How is this statistically possible?\n>\n> Five of the last six weeks, the exact same number.\n>\n> Effectively the same number in the last 11 weeks, except for the holiday\n> weeks (President's Day and Easter).\n>\n> \\---\n>\n> Consider\n>\n> The US is a $28 trillion economy. It has 160 million workers.\n>\n> Initial claims for unemployment insurance are state programs, with 50 state\n> rules, hundreds of offices, and 50 websites to file. Weather, seasonality,\n> holidays, and economic vibrations drive the number of people filing claims\n> from week to week.\n>\n> Yet this measure is so stable that it does not vary by even 1,000\n> applications a week.\n>\n> Just the number of applications incorrectly filled out every week should\n> cause it to vary more than this.\n\nStatistically, an occurrence such as this is basically impossible- for initial\nfilings to be the same exact figure, not even deviating by a measly 1,000 in\nan economy as big as ours, would require mental gymnastics that not even\nSimone Biles could undertake.\n\nWe\u2019ve known for years that CPI has also been misleading, and no wonder.\n\nThe government has a lot of tools to influence the CPI, one of which involves\nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics keeping confidentiality over the raw data used\nto calculate the CPI. Their claimed explanation is \u201cto prevent companies from\ncomparing prices\u201d. This makes zero sense as firms can just directly compare\nprices with competitors by looking up their website.\n\nMoreover, during the last three decades, the government has changed the method\nit uses to calculate inflation over 20 times. These changes, called\n'methodological improvements' to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), are claimed\nto provide a more precise reflection of consumer prices. This is hilarious,\ngiven that most consumer behavior changes slowly, with the only possible\nexception being adoption of tech products.\n\nSee their report for yourself here.\n\nAlso, the BLS assumes that consumer spending patterns shift in response to\nchanging economic conditions, including price increases. So, if consumers\nstart buying cheaper alternatives when prices go up, the CPI calculation will\ncontain a bias that fails to fully capture these price increases. Basically,\nthey can do things like substitute bacon and eggs for milk and cereal, which\nwould drive down the price of a breakfast.\n\nThe CPI directly affects the income of approximately 80 million Americans,\nincluding Social Security beneficiaries, recipients of food stamps, military\nand federal civil service retirees and survivors, and children participating\nin school lunch programs. A higher CPI means the government must spend more on\nthese income payments to match the rising cost of living. However, given that\nthe government is approximately $34 trillion in debt, a lower headline CPI\nwould reduce the amount needed for cost of living adjustments, helping to ease\nthe fiscal crisis we are currently in.\n\nShadowstats is a website that tracks inflation rate but it uses an older\nversion of the basket to find more accurate figures- we can see here that with\nthe 1980 CPI index we actually peaked at 17% inflation in 2022 and realized\ninflation was still above 10% in mid 2023.\n\nAs the fiscal crisis worsens, we can expect government manipulation to ramp up\nas well. Sadly, this is one of the signs of the Dollar Endgame- institutional\nlying, due to collapsing social trust in them and a desperate need to paper\nover real economic wounds.\n\nThe true extent of the problem cannot be hidden forever- and when this day\ncomes, the mobs of unemployed will have no mercy for the sycophantic\npoliticians or the bureaucrats which they serve.\n\nPotemkin was a Russian officer and politician who was a favorite of Catherine\nII and in 1762 helped her to seize power; when she visited the Crimea in 1787\nhe gave the order for sham villages to be built to give off the illusion of\nprosperity.
