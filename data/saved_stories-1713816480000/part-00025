More energy in Europe was generated from\nrenewables than from fossil fuels for the second year running.\n\nThe latest five-year averages show that temperatures in Europe are now running\n2.3 degrees Celsius (4.1 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, compared to\n1.3 degrees Celsius higher globally, the report says \u2014 just shy of the targets\nunder the 2015 Paris climate accord to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees\nCelsius.\n\nMORE CLIMATE COVERAGE\n\nBP defeated thousands of suits by sick Gulf spill cleanup workers. But not one\nby a boat captain\n\nPakistani province issues a flood alert and warns of a heavy loss of life from\nglacial melting\n\nNext UN climate talks are critical to plot aid for poorer nations, says\nincoming president\n\n\u201cEurope saw yet another year of increasing temperatures and intensifying\nclimate extremes \u2014 including heat stress with record temperatures, wildfires,\nheat waves, glacier ice loss and lack of snowfall,\u201d said Elisabeth Hamdouch,\nthe deputy head of unit for Copernicus at the EU\u2019s executive commission.\n\nThe report serves up a continental complement for WMO\u2019s flagship state of the\nglobal climate report, which has been published annually for three decades,\nand this year came with a \u201cred alert\u201d warning that the world isn\u2019t doing\nenough to fight the consequences of global warming.\n\nCopernicus has reported that March marked the 10th straight month of record\nmonthly temperatures. The average sea-surface temperature for the ocean across\nEurope hit its highest annual level in 2023, the Europe report said.\n\nThe European report focuses this year on the impact of high temperatures on\nhuman health, noting that deaths related to heat have risen across the\ncontinent. It said more than 150 lives were lost directly last year in\nconnection with storms, floods and wildfires.\n\nThe cost of weather- and climate-related economic losses in 2023 were\nestimated at more than 13.4 billion euros (about $14.3 billion).\n\n\u201cHundreds of thousands of people were affected by extreme climate events in\n2023, which have been responsible for large losses at continental level,\nestimated to be at least in the tens of billions of euros,\u201d said Copernicus\ndirector Carlo Buontempo.\n\nExtreme weather fanned heat waves, wildfires, droughts and flooding, the\nreport said. High temperatures have contributed to a loss of glacier ice on\nthe continent, including in the Alps \u2014 which have lost about 10% of their\nremaining glacier ice over the last two years.\n\nStill, the report\u2019s authors pointed to some exceptions, such as how\ntemperatures were below average in Scandinavia and Iceland even if the mercury\nwas higher than average across much of the continent as a whole.\n\nby Taboolaby Taboola\n\nSuggested For You\n\nDiese Solardach-F\u00f6rdergelder sind vielen Hausbesitzen v\u00f6llig neu.Checkfox\n\n:Advertisement:Advertisement\n\nIm Krankenhaus kennt fast kein Kassenpatient diesen TrickPro Verbraucher\n\n:Advertisement:Advertisement\n\nVerheiratet?
