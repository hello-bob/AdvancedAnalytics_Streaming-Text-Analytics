Over the last couple of years generative AI has become\nmore and more powerful, making the jump from photos to videos with the advent\nof tools like Sora. And now Microsoft has introduced a powerful tool that\nmight be the most impressive (and terrifying) we've seen yet.\n\nVASA-1 is an AI image-to-video model that can generate videos from just one\nphoto and a speech audio clip. Videos feature synchronised facial and lip\nmovements, as well as \"a large spectrum of facial nuances and natural head\nmotions that contribute to the perception of authenticity and liveliness.\"\n\nOn its research website, Microsoft explains how the tech works. \"The core\ninnovations include a holistic facial dynamics and head movement generation\nmodel that works in a face latent space, and the development of such an\nexpressive and disentangled face latent space using videos. Through extensive\nexperiments including evaluation on a set of new metrics, we show that our\nmethod significantly outperforms previous methods along various dimensions\ncomprehensively. Our method not only delivers high video quality with\nrealistic facial and head dynamics but also supports the online generation of\n512x512 videos at up to 40 FPS with negligible starting latency. It paves the\nway for real-time engagements with lifelike avatars that emulate human\nconversational behaviours.\"\n\n> Microsoft just dropped VASA-1.This AI can make single image sing and talk\n> from audio reference expressively.

It's notable that Microsoft insists the tool is a \"research\ndemonstration and there's no product or API release plan.\" Seemingly in an\nattempt to allay fears, the company is suggesting that VASA-1 won't be making\nits way into users' hands any time soon.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM creativebloq\n\nFrom Sora AI to Will Smith eating spaghetti, we've seen all manner of weird\nand wonderful (but mostly weird) AI generated video content, and it's only\ngoing to get more realistic. Just look how much generative AI has improved in\none year.\n\n## Get the Creative Bloq Newsletter\n\nDaily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nThank you for reading 5 articles this month* Join now for unlimited access\n\nEnjoy your first month for just \u00a31 / $1 / \u20ac1\n\nAlready have an account ?
