Now Hertz intends to sell\noff 30,000 EVs in 2024, after taking a $195 million charge last quarter\nbecause of the depreciation of its fleet. That hit, when combined with a $245\nmillion write-down in the last quarter of 2024, means Hertz has lost $440\nmillion on its failed bet on electric cars led by former CEO Stephen Sherr.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nHertz's CEO resigned after a big bet on EVs went bad\n\nAutomakers are still killing off small cars even though they keep regretting\nit\n\nAre self-driving cars safe enough yet?\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nAre self-driving cars safe enough yet?\n\nThe new round of sell-offs leaves Hertz with just 30,000 EVs in its fleet.\n\n\u201cFleet and direct operating costs weighed on this quarter\u2019s performance,\u201d CEO\nGil West, a former executive at Delta and General Motors\u2019 Cruise unit who\njoined Hertz on April 1, said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re tackling both issues -\ngetting to the right supply of vehicles at an acceptable capital cost while at\nthe same time driving productivity up and operating costs down.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHertz stock fell more than 3% in Friday morning trading. The stock has dropped\nalmost 56% this year, bringing its market capitalization down to $1.38\nbillion.\n\nThe rental firm said its EV fleet turned out to be not just a financial drain,\nbut a burden on consumers. Many renters were unfamiliar with how to charge or\notherwise properly use an EV, but chose to do so anyway because of what was\navailable, West told analysts on an earnings call Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHertz\u2019s EV troubles come just a few years after it moved to purchase 100,000\nelectric cars from Tesla and inked a since-paused agreement with Polestar to\nbuy new electrics. It had also partnered with Uber to add up to 50,000 EVs to\nthe ride-share company\u2019s network. By the end of 2024, Hertz wanted a quarter\nof its fleet to be electric.\n\nBut by the end of last year, the company was taking big hits because of EVs.\nTesla\u2019s rapid price cuts \u2014 designed to combat slowing sales growth \u2014 hurt the\nvalue of Hertz\u2019s fleet. And Hertz said the cost to repair Teslas was twice the\ncost of comparable gas-powered cars.\n\n## \ud83d\udcec Sign up for the Daily Brief\n\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every\nweekday morning.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
