Existing integrations often feature limited open\nsourcing, challenging collective progress in this field. We introduce LEGENT,\nan open, scalable platform for developing embodied agents using LLMs and LMMs.\nLEGENT offers a dual approach: a rich, interactive 3D environment with\ncommunicable and actionable agents, paired with a user-friendly interface, and\na sophisticated data generation pipeline utilizing advanced algorithms to\nexploit supervision from simulated worlds at scale. In our experiments, an\nembryonic vision-language-action model trained on LEGENT-generated data\nsurpasses GPT-4V in embodied tasks, showcasing promising generalization\ncapabilities.\n\nView arXiv page View PDF Add to collection\n\n### Community\n\n\u00b7 Sign up or log in to comment\n\nUpvote\n\n4\n\n## Models citing this paper 0\n\nNo model linking this paper\n\nCite arxiv.org/abs/2404.18243 in a model README.md to link it from this page.\n\n## Datasets citing this paper 0\n\nNo dataset linking this paper\n\nCite arxiv.org/abs/2404.18243 in a dataset README.md to link it from this\npage.\n\n### Spaces citing this paper 0\n\nNo Space linking this paper\n\nCite arxiv.org/abs/2404.18243 in a Space README.md to link it from this page.\n\n## Collections including this paper 3\n\n", "frontpage": false}
