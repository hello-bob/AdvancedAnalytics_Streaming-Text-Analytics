Her work has previously appeared at NPR, Wired, and\nThe Verge.\n\nTikTokTikTok creators can\u2019t seem to escape a maelstrom of policy and security\nconcerns lately. On Wednesday, President Joe Biden signed a $95 billion\nnational security package into law. Nestled inside it was the Protecting\nAmericans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which gives\nTikTok parent company ByteDance 270 days to sell the platform or cease\noperations in the United States. Policymakers maintain that the bill is not a\n\u201cban,\u201d but a way to get the China-based ByteDance to divest from TikTok. The\nbattle over TikTok could play out in the courts for far longer than the\nroughly nine-month window before the deadline, but the uncertain future of the\napp has kicked up a fervor among its many creators, who depend on it for\ncommunity, connection, and their livelihoods.\n\nOver 150 million Americans used TikTok in 2023, and a potential ban \u2014 or other\naction that would radically change the app \u2014 would alter the fabric of modern\nAmerican culture. It\u2019s a hub for cute anime edits, the perfect four-ingredient\nsalad recipe, tips on how to clean your home, other users\u2019 personal diary\nentries gone viral, and, in contrast to Washington\u2019s action, a place where\nlawmakers can speak directly to constituents. TikTok is home to a plethora of\ncommunities and conversations, and people who make content for the platform\nare having to contend with a potential end to it all. As creators and experts\ntell Polygon, TikTok is a nexus for audience building with ties to every other\nsocial platform, and losing it would erode the livelihoods of people trying to\nstay connected in a splintering online experience.\n\nCasey Fiesler, a professor in the University of Colorado Boulder\u2019s department\nof information science who has amassed more than 115,000 followers on TikTok\nherself with videos about the cultural significance of the platform, says\nTikTok\u2019s greatest achievement is its recommendation algorithm. Compared to\nother apps, it\u2019s \u201cexceptionally good\u201d at helping people find what they need \u2014\nspecifically, viewers who are often suppressed in other areas of life. Fiesler\npoints to political organizing, LGBTQ rights, and chronic illness as topics\nwhere TikTok\u2019s recommendation engine has allowed people with shared\nexperiences and perspectives to cluster. \u201cThey literally find lifesaving\ninformation and support,\u201d she says.\n\nTikTok\u2019s astonishing ability to connect people to audiences who share their\nspecific interests is reflected in the rise of some of its biggest creators.\nEleanor Barnes, better known by the handle Snitchery, built a massive audience\nof over 4.1 million followers on TikTok by sharing videos showcasing inventive\nmakeup looks and offbeat cosplays. If you don\u2019t know her by her handle, you\nmight have seen her as the cabbage salesman from Avatar: The Last Airbender or\na cursed Thomas the Tank Engine.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working as a full-time content creator for almost a decade, and\nwithin the first year of signing up, TikTok quickly became the platform with\nmy largest audience,\u201d Barnes tells Polygon. For her, losing TikTok wouldn\u2019t\njust be about missing out on that audience, but on using the platform as a way\nto find information for herself. \u201cMore than anything, I\u2019d miss all the things\nI learn from TikTok on a regular basis. Everything from obscure historical\nfacts to how to tie a tie, I typically go straight there. I\u2019ve been in the\nindustry long enough career-wise; I think I\u2019ll be all right regardless of what\nhappens with the ban. I still have my other platforms. But to lose access to\nall of that information would be a huge shame,\u201d Barnes says.\n\nBarnes and most creators have other platforms to turn to, but as many note,\nTikTok serves as a catalyst that brings viewers to the other platforms. Umi,\nbetter known online by her handle, Uwumi, rose to TikTok fame in 2019 after\ngoing viral for dancing to a remix of \u201cJump Up, Super Star!\u201d from Super Mario\nOdyssey. Uwumi says TikTok jump-started the \u201centirety\u201d of her online presence\nand community. The platform remains the easiest place \u201cfor anyone to go viral\non without necessarily being dependent on quality\u201d or video length. Her\n900,000-plus following is also instrumental in securing sponsorships. \u201cAll of\nthe opportunities I\u2019ve been afforded\u2014my community, connections, sponsorships,\nand platform in general\u2014have been thanks to my initial rise on TikTok in\n2019,\u201d she writes via email.\n\nNina Kemper, talent manager at Grail Talent, an agency that represents over\n650 creators worldwide, says a TikTok ban would not just take away direct\nplatform revenue streams, like the TikTok Creator Fund Program, but could\nresult in creators losing brand deals that go beyond the platform. \u201cMany of\nthem have been on the platform for years and have built a loyal following that\nprimarily resides on TikTok,\u201d Kemper says over email, \u201cso many are fearful\nthat years of hard work and dedication could soon be taken away with no\nresolve to be found.\u201d\n\nKevin Espiritu, the person behind Epic Gardening, which gives people gardening\ntips, estimated that any fracturing or complete ban of the app would result in\nhim losing 3.1 million followers \u2014 many of whom are in an 18-24 demographic\nthat likely wouldn\u2019t cross back over to Instagram, YouTube, or other social\nplatforms. And for Espiritu, that audience is the \u201cproving ground\u201d for\nexperimentation that other algorithms could reject.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be hopeful that the \u2018gap\u2019 would be filled by an increase in YouTube\nShorts viewership or Instagram Reels, but wouldn\u2019t be sure,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\nwould definitely be a big hit to our brand. A lot of awesome collaboration\nopportunities have arisen as a result of using TikTok exclusively.\u201d Espiritu\npoints to appearances on national talk shows that plucked him off the\nplatform.\n\nWhile it\u2019s easy to focus on larger influencers, Fiesler also emphasizes that\nthe loss of TikTok could impact smaller and mid-size creators who rely on the\napp for much-needed extra income. Anecdotally, during the COVID-19 pandemic,\nshe heard that TikTok became a significant source of income for creators with\ndisabilities \u2014 a second job that could dry up if ByteDance doesn\u2019t find a\nviable buyer.\n\n\u201cWhen people talk about loss of income, I think what they have in mind is huge\ninfluencers with six-figure brand deals,\u201d Fiesler says. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m\ntalking about when I talk about loss of income. I mean someone who is working\na full-time minimum-wage job, and in their free time, they can do something\nthat\u2019s kind of fun. They\u2019re talking about Stardew Valley on TikTok, and they\ncan make an extra $100 a month from the TikTok Creator Program. Losing that\n$100 a month could mean that they suddenly have problems paying their rent.\u201d\n\nErynn Chambers, known on the platform as Rynnstar, a creator whose commentary\nranges from contemporary political issues to in-depth discussions of Steven\nUniverse, has amassed more than 1.2 million followers. Her profile serves as a\ncenter of conversation dissecting politics and popular culture. If TikTok went\naway, Rynnstar would likely shift to Twitch and YouTube, but for now, she\u2019s\nbiding time by speaking out about the legislation.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s unconscionable that the government would make such a blatant\nattempt at limiting the free speech of its citizens,\u201d Chambers says. \u201cTikTok\nis no greater threat to our data security than any other social media platform\nand frankly perhaps even less so. Once again our so-called representatives\nhave completely failed to represent the interests of their constituents in\nfavor of lobbying groups.\u201d\n\nLawmakers argue that TikTok owner ByteDance has shared, or could share, TikTok\nuser data with the Chinese government. There is some evidence, albeit not\noverwhelming evidence, to suggest that this has taken place. TikTok definitely\nhas its share of problems, and despite making a case for the power of TikTok,\nFiesler acknowledges its failures. However, just taking it away altogether\nwould have enormous impacts on its many creators. In the end, it\u2019s about\naccounting for the fact that the platform can be improved, and for the\nnegative effects of banning it.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of problems,\u201d Fiesler says. \u201cThere are privacy problems.\nThere are content moderation problems. There are bias problems. There\u2019s a lot\nthat I can say \u2014 there\u2019s problems about how they pay people. There\u2019s a lot\nthat I can say. Most of the things that I can say are also problems on other\nsocial media platforms. And those things don\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t also a\nlot of good on the platform.\u201d\n\n#### Loading comments...\n\nChorus\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n\n  * Contact\n  * Send Us a Tip\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * Masthead\n  * Editorial Ethics and Guidelines\n  * How to Write for Polygon\n  * About Us\n\nVox Media Advertise with us Jobs @ Vox Media \u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
