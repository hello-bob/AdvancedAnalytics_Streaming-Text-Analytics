It is not exactly a standard laptop, but the\nMuseBook, as it\u2019s called, has features and capabilities aimed at hardware\nengineers, developers, and DIY enthusiasts. While no official launch date is\navailable, it\u2019s expected to be available soon at a relatively low price of\n$300.\n\nThe MuseBook looks vaguely like an Apple MacBook, primarily from the printed\nname at the bottom of its display bezel. A 14.1-inch IPS panel with a 1920 x\n1080 resolution and 60Hz refresh rate is standard. The keyboard is more akin\nto Windows machines, but the dedicated Windows button has been replaced by a\nRISC-V button. There\u2019s no news yet on what function that button might provide\nsince the unit provided to CNX Software would not power on.\n\nImage 1 of 3\n\nThe MuseBook keyboard looks like a standard Windows keyboard, but with its own\nRISC-V button.(Image credit: CNX Software)\n\n(Image credit: CNX Software)\n\nThe MuseBook features an 8-pin header(Image credit: CNX Software)\n\nThe laptop weighs in at 1.3kg and is approximately 18mm thick. It provides a\nMicroSD card slot, two USB-C ports, two USB 3.0 Type-A ports, a 3.5mm\nheadphone jack, and an 8-pin header with pins for power, multiplexed I2C,\nUART, PWM, GPIO, and more. The full specifications for the K1 SoC are listed\nbelow:\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally\n\nSpacemiT K1 SoC specificationsCPU| Octa-Core X60 64-bit RISC-V core (faster\nthan Cortex-A55 in multi-core configuration)  \n---|---  \nGPU| Unnamed with support for OpenCL 3.0, OpenGL ES3.2, Vulkan 1.2  \nVPU| H.265/H.264/VP9/VP8 4K encoding/encoding  \nAI accelerator| 2.0 TOPS AI NPU  \nMemory| Up to 16GB 32bit LPDDR4-2400MT, 32bit LPDDR4X-2666MT, Up to 10.6GB/S\nbandwidth  \nStorage| Supports SPI FLASH, eMMC 5.1, SDIO 3.0 SD Card, NVME(PCIe2.1 2x)  \nDisplay| MIPI-DSI and HDMI up to 1920\u00d71440 @ 60Hz  \nRow 7 - Cell 0| Support for dual display setups  \nAudio| 3X Mic-in  \nCamera| 8-lane MIPI-CSI in 4+2+2-lane or 4+4-lane configuration  \nRow 10 - Cell 0| Single camera supports up to 16MP  \nRow 11 - Cell 0| Supports three camera inputs  \nConnectivity| 2x GMAC  \nRow 13 - Cell 0| 1x USB 3.0 (multiplexed with PCIe 2.1 x1)  \nRow 14 - Cell 0| 1x USB OTG  \nRow 15 - Cell 0| 1x USB HOST  \nRow 16 - Cell 0| 5x PCIe 2.1 (x2+x2+x1 combined, 5Gbps/lane)  \nRow 17 - Cell 0| 4x SPI, 7x I2C, 12x UART, 2x CAN-FD, 30x PWM  \nPower consumption| 3-5W TDP  \nPakcage| FCCSP 17x17mm, 0.65mm pitch  \n  \nThe laptop's storage includes up to 128GB of onboard eMMC flash memory, M.2\nNVMe SSD options up to 1TB, and a MicroSD card slot. The K1 RISC-V System-on-\na-Chip (SoC) is configured with up to 16GB of LPDDR4X RAM. Wireless networking\nconnectivity is available via the installed RTL8852BE-based WiFi 6 module.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware\n\nImage 1 of 3\n\n(Image credit: CNX Software)\n\n(Image credit: CNX Software)\n\n(Image credit: CNX Software)\n\nThe MuseBook runs Bianbu OS, an operating system based on Debian and optimized\nfor the K1 RISC-V SoC. Presumably, it will include common office software such\nas LibreOffice and the Chromium browser. It will also include optimized\nOpenCV, OpenBLAS, Slam Eigen, libpng, libjpeg, XNNPACK, and other algorithm\nlibraries for development purposes.\n\nIf preferred, you can also install the Linux flavor of your choice or RTOS on\nthe laptop. Of course, finding RISC-V packages in standard repositories might\nprove problematic.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally\n\nSpacemiT MuseBook specificationsSoC| SpacemiT K1 octa-core X60 RISC-V core\ncompliant with RVA22 (see full SoC specifications details above)  \n---|---  \nSystem memory| Up to 16GB 32bit LPDDR4-2400MT, 32bit LPDDR4X-2666MT  \nStorage| 32GB eMMC flash (default), option up to 128GB  \nRow 3 - Cell 0| M.2 (PCIe 2.1 2x) socket for NVMe SSD up to 1TB  \nRow 4 - Cell 0| MicroSD card slot  \nDisplay| 14.1-inch IPS display with 1920\u00d71080 resolution, 60Hz refresh rate  \nRow 6 - Cell 0| 72% NTSC (\u2248100%sRGB) Color gamut  \nRow 7 - Cell 0| 250 nits brightness  \nNetworking| RTL8852BE-based WiFi 6 module  \nPower supply| USB PD 3.1 Type-C port (65W power adapter)  \nDimensions| 322.6 x 209.2 x 17.8mm  \nWeight| 1.36kg  \nOS| Bianbu OS by Debian, Ubuntu, Linux  \nBrowser| Chromium  \n  \nOf course, this isn\u2019t the first RISC-V laptop to come to market. We\u2019ve\nreviewed the Sipeed Lichee Console 4A in the past, and there\u2019s also the ROMA\nlaptop. However, the K1 is the first RISC-V SoC to comply with the RISC-V\nFoundation\u2019s RVA22 and 256-bit RVV 1.0 standards. While not exactly blazing\nfast compared to, for example, the Intel Core Ultra CPU, SpacemiT\u2019s K1 SoC\ndoes provide 2 TOPS of AI computing power.\n\n## Stay on the Cutting Edge\n\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\ntech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.
