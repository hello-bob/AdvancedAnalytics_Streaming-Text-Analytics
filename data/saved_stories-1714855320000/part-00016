This tool was built by Jasmine Lu (@xjasminelu), Beza Desta\n(@Beza20), Joyce Passananti (@Joyce-Passananti) with project assistance from\nK.D. Wu, Romain Nith, and Pedro Lopes at the University of Chicago's Human\nComputer Integration Lab.\n\nPaper | Video\n\n## ecoEDA\n\necoEDA is a python-based tool that integrates with KiCad. It is designed to\nprovide suggestions of recycled components whenever you add a new symbol to\nyour schematic.\n\n### Features Overview\n\necoEDA library generator Users can create an ecoEDA library (library of\nelectronic components recycled from e-waste) by using a spreadsheet (.csv) to\ninventory their parts and using our custom scripts to translate their\ninventory into a KiCad compatible ecoEDA library. This allows for use of these\ncomponents when building schematics in KiCad. More details on the how-to page.\n\nImport previous schematics To allow for reusing components from previous\nschematics. Users can use our custom script to import previous schematics to\nadd their parts to their ecoEDA library. More details on the how-to page.\n\nIn-editor suggestions As you add new components to your schematic, ecoEDA will\nsearch through the libary to offer suggestions for potential replacements.\nThese will appear as pop-ups on the side of your KiCad editor window. For a\nwalkthrough of all our suggestion types and a preview of how these suggestions\nwork, check out our video.\n\nSuggestion types include (1) exact-match: components that are exactly the same\nas the added component, (2) drop-in: components that aren't the same but have\nthe same pin-out and footprint enabling easy swapping in, (3) exact-match,\ndifferent footprint: components that are the same but have different\nfootprints/packaging, (4) ranked suggestions: allowing users to see a full\nlist of potentially relevant swaps and allow users to filter through this list\nby value or footprint, and (5) subcircuit suggestions: allowing users to swap\nin a subcircuit of multiple components from their library that achieve the\nsame function as the original component. More details on the how-to page.\n\nBill of Teardowns To assist users with locating their parts and determining\nwhat e-waste devices will need to be torn down to source parts for their\nprojects, ecoEDA will generate a bill of teardowns from your project. Similar\nto a bill of materials, it is a list grouped by source device of components\nused in your schematic. More details on the how-to page.\n\necoEDA Dashboard To encourage users to keep up with their reuse progress,\necoEDA also tracks the number of projects you use ecoEDA on, the number of\nrecycled parts you've used across projects, and more! More details on the how-\nto page.\n\n### How to install/use ecoEDA\n\nTo use ecoEDA, you must have installed KiCad (v7+) and Python3 on your\nmachine. The system was built primarily with Mac OS. We have a version for\nWindows but please note that there have been several issues encountered for\nWindows.\n\nDetailed instructions can be found on the page INSTALL.md\n\n### Submitting issues\n\nAs this tool was born out of a research project, it is a prototype. However,\nwe'd love to hear about any bugs you might encounter during use of our tool.\nWe encourage you to submit any issues that arise and we'll do our best to get\naround to them. Please note that there is only one (very busy) PhD student who\nwill be able to provide support, so please extend us grace with any issues you\nencounter!\n\n### Contributing\n\n(adapted from Clipy)\n\n  1.
