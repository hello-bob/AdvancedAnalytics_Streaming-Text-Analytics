In light of this, I\ndecided to resubmit iDOS. However, it looks like Apple has blacklisted iDOS 2,\npreventing me from even requesting a review under that title, and I had to\nsubmit under a brand new title \"iDOS 3\".\n\nHere's where things got interesting. Initially they rejected the submission\nbecause it was same as iDOS 2, but after I explained to them that I can not\ncontinue under iDOS2, then they rejected again as \"Design spam\" on the basis\nthat there has been many submissions lately with the exact same design.\n\nI don't actually care much about the copycats, but just can't understand why\nit's difficult for Apple to check my account history and tell which is the\noriginal. It's a little bit insulting that I had to tell the story to them\ntime and time again and yet the issue is unresolved after 1 week.\n\nFor the people that are waiting, I am hopeful that we will sort it out\neventually. And if everything indeed goes well, there will be updates coming\nto justify this version bump.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
