While some people enjoyed the devices, it is safe to say these were\nnot the launches the companies had hoped for. At the same time, other startups\nhave raised millions in venture capital to build new consumer hardware\ndevices. Investors I know are actively looking to deploy money into the\ncategory, and Sam Altman and Jony Ive are in talks to raise up to a billion\ndollars for a consumer hardware device.\n\nThis disparity raises so many questions: Why are these new devices being\nreceived so poorly? What do founders and investors believe they\u2019ll get by\nbetting their careers on this difficult and clearly uphill battle? Will their\nbets actually work?\n\nTo figure out the answers, I\u2019ve been in the weeds with founders, talking\nproduct roadmaps, capital strategies, and levels of excitement. Here\u2019s what I\nlearned.\n\n## Why is this hardware\u2019s moment?\n\nThe reasoning behind the rapid new launches and investor bets is simple. It\u2019s\nAI.\n\nMany see AI as a technological paradigm shift akin to jumping from personal\ncomputers to mobile computing\u2014and there is a chance that a new Apple could be\nbuilt. With Palo Alto\u2019s favorite fruit-centric company currently enjoying a\n$2.68 trillion market capitalization, people are feeling like Louis Armstrong\ndid when he touched a trumpet for the first time (quite jazzed).\n\nI\u2019ve previously argued the components of a hardware device can be broken down\ninto three groups:\n\n  1. Silicon: The chips running the computation for the device\n  2. Interface: How you, as a user, interact with the device\n  3. Sensors: The instruments providing data to the software running on a device\u2014cameras, accelerometers, a GPS, a heartbeat sensor, etc.\n\nNew consumer devices are emerging because AI allows you to use the sensors,\nsilicon, and interfaces developed for smartphones in novel ways. AI can take\nthe input of large amounts of ambient data, such as the audio from your\nconversations and your behavior as you use your computer. Then, AI can output\nunique insights based on that corpus of data\u2014much more personalized,\nsensitive, and accurate than what regular software can do today. It can also\nleverage existing data for new actions, such as following voice commands more\nclosely. Basically, it\u2019ll listen to what you say and bring out smart stuff\nthat you missed.\n\nWhile my description may be banal, the possibilities are exciting. Smartphones\nare dominant, but aren\u2019t perfect. Consumer addiction is\u2014at least in my\nestimation\u2014largely due to the monetization of smartphone app stores and the\nform factor of the device. If AI can evolve our relationships with devices,\nit\u2019s a meaningful change. An AI ambiently crunching data and performing tasks\nwithout the distraction of a screen is net good for humanity. And, as a happy\ncapitalistic coincidence, it would probably make the inventor of said device\nthe owner of several large yachts.\n\nSo if the promise is so wonderful, why is the category so challenging?\n\n## The problem of the iPhone\n\nThe answer is, once again, simple: The iPhone is too damn good.\n\nIf I asked you to visualize what the iPhone disrupted, you\u2019d probably think of\nan image like this\u2014a brick cell phone, a digital camera, a GPS.\n\nSource: CNET.\n\nApple\u2019s disruption happened because it brought all the sensors in all these\ndevices into one form factor. Since the iPhone had a powerful chip and a\nmulti-touch screen interface, it became a catch-all device that does pretty\nmuch everything pretty well. Sure, it isn\u2019t perfect\u2014the Kindle exists\u2014but the\nsmartphone is so incredible because the interface is flexible enough that it\ncan do a good enough job at essentially everything a consumer needs.\n\nSource: Every illustration.\n\nApple has spent 18 years and hundreds of billions of dollars stuffing ever-\nbetter components into ever-more-powerful phones. Its market dominance has\nyielded a supply chain and manufacturing partners that a startup can\u2019t hope to\nmatch.\n\nAn AI hardware company is in the unenviable position of having inferior\nsensors than Apple, generic silicon chips, and a grand total of zero\ndevelopers in its ecosystem. It is very, very hard to compete with an iPhone\nwhen every piece of hardware you have access to is worse. So these companies\nhave to try to innovate on the interface. My current favorite AI hardware\ndevice, the Meta Ray-Bans, eschew multi-touch glass in favor of voice\nactivation. The R1 has a scroll wheel, and Humane uses a laser projector.\n\nWhen you\u2019re playing with these odds, your best bet is to differentiate on the\nsoftware\u2014not the hardware. Which means that, basically, most consumer AI\nhardware should just be an app. One founder told me as much: \u201cMy company\nshould probably just be an app, but hardware sounded more fun.\u201d While this\nstatement may be true, customers do not particularly care about how good of a\ntime a CEO is having.\n\nAnd if AI is what has gotten the market so excited, it should be the\ncompetitive edge, too. Both Rabbit and Humane\u2019s products have been reviewed so\ncritically because while the hardware is beautiful, they are less powerful and\ngeneralizable than the smartphone. And in both devices, the redeeming factor\nof AI doesn\u2019t actually work\u2014large language models are not good enough yet to\nbe virtual assistants. The hardware was rushed to market before the AI was\nready. As popular reviewer Marques Brownlee, aka MKBHD, said:\n\n\u201cThis is the pinnacle of a trend that's been annoying for years: Delivering\nbarely finished products to win a \u2018race\u2019 and then continuing to build them\nafter charging full price. Games, phones, cars, now AI in a box.\u201d\n\nBut if we wait for the AI to be \u201cready,\u201d we\u2019ll run into more problems. It is\nincredibly expensive and challenging to differentiate on the basis of AI\nmodels. Like I just wrote, open-source can now provide GPT-4-levels of\nperformance, so startups have to train a model to do something no other open-\nsource model can\u2014adding scientific research to the many hurdles that they\u2019re\ntrying to conquer.\n\n## What happens next with AI hardware?\n\nTo be clear, I very much want these companies to succeed. As a red-blooded\ncapitalist, I love competition. To compete with Apple, AI hardware companies\nhave three paths:\n\n  1. Get weird with it. Explore use cases that are fundamentally different from smartphones. By focusing on markets where phones have proven ineffectual, such as healthcare or manufacturing, companies can carve out a space for themselves. Experimenting with unconventional interfaces like brain-computer interfaces, haptics, or augmented reality could also help them stand out.\n  2. Go screen-free. Develop AI-powered devices that primarily rely on voice interactions, such as the Meta Ray-Bans. Ironically, Humane may have been right on this count.\n  3. Rely on the phone. Rather than trying to replace smartphones entirely, focus on using the smartphone\u2019s silicon and interface, with a hardware component acting as a supplemental sensor to gather data. Tab and Limitless are taking this approach: They sell an extra sensor, but the software lives in the cloud, and the hardware requires a connection to a phone via Bluetooth.\n\nVenture-backed startups have an over 90 percent failure rate. These companies'\nstruggles and long odds are a feature, not a bug. We should be cheering for\nevery single founder trying something new. There is a viable path! But it\nrequires something wholly new and different. Startups doing the same-old end\nup with the same-old result\u2014failure.\n\nEvan Armstrong is the lead writer for Every, where he writes the Napkin Math\ncolumn.
