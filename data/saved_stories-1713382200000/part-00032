Additionally, there were market forecasts for the rapid growth of\nembedded pico projectors in 2009 and beyond. This convinced us to develop a\nsmall liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS) microdisplay for embedded pico\nprojectors. With so many companies saying they needed pico projectors, it\nseemed like a good idea at the time. How could so many people be wrong?\n\nHere we are six years later, and almost no pico projectors are embedded in\ncell phones or much else. So what happened? Just about the same time we\nstarted working on pico projectors, Apple introduced their first iPhone. The\niPhone overnight roughly tripled the size of the display screen of a\nsmartphone such as a Blackberry. Furthermore, Apple introduced ways to control\nthe screen (pinch/zoom, double-clicking to zoom in on a column, etc.) to\nbetter use a small display. Then to make matters much worse, Apple introduced\nthe iPad and the tablet market took off almost instantaneously. Today we have\nlarger phones, so-called \u201cphablets,\u201d and small tablets filling in just about\nevery size.\n\nAdditionally, I have written about before the use model for a cell phone pico\nprojector shooting on a wall doesn\u2019t work. There is rarely a dark enough place\nwith something that will work well for a screen in a convenient place.\n\nWhen you carry a pico projector and screen with you, a thin iPad/tablet works\nbetter, you can carry it around the room easily, and you don\u2019t have to have a\nvery dark environment. I found that to use a pico projector; I had to carry a\nscreen (at least a white piece of paper mounted on a stiff board in a plastic\nsleeve to keep it clean and flat) with me. Then you have the issue of holding\nthe screen up so you can project on it and then find a dark enough place that\nthe image looks good.\n\nThe above is the subjective analysis; the rest of this article will give more\nquantitative numbers.\n\nThe fundamental problem with a front projector is that it has to compete with\nambient light, whereas flat panels have screens that generally absorb 91% to\n96% of the ambient light (thus, they look dark when off). While display makers\nmarket contrast numbers, these very high contrast numbers assume a dark\nenvironment; in the real world, what counts is the net contrast, that is, the\ncontrast factoring in ambient light.\n\nDisplaymate has an excellent set of articles (including SmartPhone Brightness\nShootout, Mobile Brightness Shootout 2, and Smartphone Shootout 2) on the\nsubject of what they call \u201cContrast Rating for High Ambient Light\u201d (CRHAL),\nwhich they define as the display brightness per unit area (in candela\u2019s per\nmeter squared, also known as \u201cnits\u201d) of the display divide by the reflectivity\nof ambient light in percent by the display.\n\nDisplaymate\u2019s CRHAL is not a \u201ccontrast ratio\u201d but a good way to compare\ndisplays with reasonable ambient light. Also important is that a front\nprojector does not take much ambient light to dominate the contrast. Even dim\nroom light is \u201chigh ambient light for a front projector.\u201d\n\nThe total light projected out of a projector is given in lumens, so to compare\nit to a cell phone or tablet, we have to know how big the projected image will\nbe and the type of screen. We can then compute the reflected light in \u201cnits,\u201d\nwhich is calculated by the following formula Candelas/meter^2 = nits = Gn x\n(lumens/m^2)/PI (where Gn is the gain of the screen and PI = ~3.1416). If we\nassume a piece of white paper with a gain of 1 (about right for a piece of\ngood printer paper), then we have to calculate the screen area in meters-\nsquare, multiply by the lumens, and divide by PI.\n\nA pico projector projecting a 16:9 (HDTV aspect ratio) on a white sheet of\nnotebook paper (with a gain of, say, 1) results in an 8.8-inch by 5-inch image\nwith an area of 0.028 m^2 (about the same area as an iPad2 which I will use\nfor comparison). Plugging a 20-lumen projector into the equation above with a\nscreen of 0.028 m^2 and a gain of 1.0, we get 227 nits. The problem is that\nthe same screen/paper will reflect (diffusing it) about 100% of the ambient\nlight. Using Displaymate\u2019s CRHAL, we get 227/100 = 2.27.\n\nNow compare the pico projector numbers to an iPad2 of the same display area,\nwhich according to Displaymate, has 410 nits and only reflects 8.7% of the\nambient light. The CRHAL for the iPad2 is 410/8.7 = 47. What crushes the pico\nprojector by about 20 to 1 with CRHAL metric is that the flat panel display\nreflects less than 10th of the ambient light, whereas the pico projector\u2019s\nimage has to fight with 100% of the ambient light.\n\nIn terms of contrast, to get a barely \u201creadable\u201d B&W image, you need at least\n1.5:1 contrast (the \u201cwhite\u201d needs to be 1.5 brighter than the black) and\npreferably more than 2:1. To have moderately good (but not great) colors you\nneed 10:1 contrast.\n\nA well-lit room has about 100 to 500 lux (see Table 1 at the bottom of this\narticle) and a bright \u201ctask area\u201d of up to 1500 lux. If we take 350 lux as a\n\u201ctypical\u201d room, then there are about 10 lumens of ambient light for the sheet\nof paper screen in our 0.028 m^2 image used above. Thus our 20-lumen projector\non top of the 10 lumens of ambient has a contrast ratio of 30/10 or about 3 to\n1 which means the colors will be pretty washed out, but the black-on-white\ntext will be readable. To get reasonably good (but not great) colors with a\ncontrast ratio of 10:1, we would need about 80 lumens. By the same measure,\nthe iPad2 in the same lighting would have a contrast ratio of about 40:1 or\nover 10x the contrast of a 20-lumen pico projector. And the brighter the\nlighting environment, the worse the pico projector will compare. Even if we\ndouble or triple the lumens, the pico projector can\u2019t compete.\n\nWith the information above, you can plug in whatever numbers you want for\nbrightness and screen size; no matter the reasonable numbers you plug in, you\nwill find that a pico projector can\u2019t compete with a tablet even in moderate\nlighting conditions.\n\nAfter working on the problem for several years, it became clear that rather\nthan adding a pico projector with its added battery, they would be better off\njust making the display bigger (ala the Galaxy S3 and S4 or even the Note).\nThe microdisplay devices created would have to look for other markets, such as\nthe closed eye (for example, Google Glass) and automotive Heads Up Display\n(HUD). And all this is before considering the power consumption and space a\npico projector would take.\n\nTable 1.

Of course, to use a tablet you need to carry\nan extra (quite large) device. I can also see a possible application for a\nstand alone 200 lumen projector to connect to, and be recharged by, a laptop\nfor projection of TV-sized images for small meeting presentations. Meeting\nrooms can be dimmed.\n\nLoading...\n\n     * #### admin\n\nAugust 4, 2013 / 12:31 pm Reply\n\nIan,\n\nThanks for the feedback.\n\nThere certainly is a market but it is relatively small for \u201ctraveling\nprofessionals.\u201d The problem is that when you are traveling and you don\u2019t know\nif a projector or TV is going to be available, you usually also don\u2019t know if\nthe lighting conditions and/or room arrangement are going to be conducive to\nusing a projector while you know for sure your laptop screen or tablet will at\nleast work in any indoor environment. Yes, usually meeting rooms can be dimmed\n(although I have been in a few where they can\u2019t), but I have been in meeting\nrooms where curtains can\u2019t be drawn and the room is too bright.\n\nIf there are only a few people in the meeting then a laptop or tablet will\nwork. If the room is larger, then it will usually already have a projector or\nlarge TV screen in it and/or the room it not conducive (lighting and/or a good\nplace to project to) for using a 200 or so lumen projector.\n\nLoading...\n\n  2. #### admin\n\nAugust 5, 2013 / 2:44 pm Reply\n\nI received a comment from an anonymous email address which asked some\nquestions but also include some rude comments in it. I have copied the\nquestions below and will follow up with my reply:\n\nComparing a projector to an iPad seems like a specious argument to me. I\u2019ll\nplay your game and pose you a question: Can you tell me the CRHAL, weight\nand/or logistics for carrying an iPad with a 200 inch display on it? How does\nit compare to a pico projector that can project a 200 inch display?\n\nWhy is it that you are the only person that possess such expert knowledge of\nthe subject while other companies are wasting 100\u2032s of millions developing\npico technology FOR mobile devices?\n\nHow is it that OSRAM recently won the \u201cElectronic 2012 PRODUCT of the YEAR\u201d\naward for their green laser diode where they specifically state, and I quote,\n\u201cthe green laser diodes represent a milestone in the development of miniature\nprojectors for mobile devices such as smartphones and cameras?\u201d\n\nLoading...\n\n     * #### admin\n\nAugust 5, 2013 / 3:10 pm Reply\n\nProjecting a 200-inch image from a pico projector is a marketing stunt and not\na typical or realistic real world use. A 200-in diagonal image in HD aspect\nratio has an area of 12 square meters! If we assume a pico projector with 20\nlumens (the upper end of what has been embedded in any product) that gives\nabout 1.6 Lux and if projected on a white screen with a gain of 1.0 on a\nridiculously small 0.5 nits. Consider that a very dimly lit room as more than\n1 LUX of ambient light.\n\nUnless the room is nearly pitch black the image is going to be totally washed\nout. SMPTE recomments 48nits for a high quality viewing experience so you need\nabout 100 times the brightness for 2000 lumens.\n\nAs to \u201cElectronic Product Awards,\u201d this is also more of a marketing\ncompetition than any measure of commercial viability. If you look at OSRAM\u2019s\nproduct offering to date they only support 50mW of green at about 520nm which\ntranslates to about a 7 to 8 lumen projector (using LBS or LCOS).\n\nEven the most optimistic pricing I have hear for the direct green lasers make\nthem ridiculously too expensive for the light they product to be used in a\nprojector. They are apparently finding some market in $260 to $600 gun sights\n(I estimate in the few 10\u2032s of thousands). A green LED supporting more than 10\nlumens is more on the order of $2.\n\nThere are some very large projectors starting to use frequency doubled (IR\nconverted to green) lasers, but the direct green lasers required by pico\nprojectors are not even close to being viable in terms of lumens/Watt of\nenergy or lumens/dollar.\n\nLoading...\n\n  3. #### kristie coffey\n\nDecember 1, 2013 / 11:51 am Reply\n\nHave you seen microvision a (available embedded the size of a penny)\nprojector.

Additionally a 50 lumen laser scanning projector\nwould have serious safety concerns (laser illuminated projectors were the\nlight is spread out over the area of the entire display is a different\nmatter). I don\u2019t think that even Microvision has officially claimed they have\na 50 lumen projector only that it would be possible someday.\n\nFirst off the the lasers requires are very expensive (many hundreds of dollars\nto produce a green laser for scanning with enough light output). Microvision\u2019s\ndemonstrated products are extremely power inefficient (look through this blog\nfor my actual measurements of Microvision systems) so that \u201cless battery\nconsumption\u201d is a marketing claim unsubstantiated by facts.\n\nLoading...\n\n  4. #### Terence Howard\n\nNovember 25, 2016 / 2:36 pm Reply\n\nInteresting article.\n\nWireless Mobi Solution (WMS) will be launching our Movi 1Q17.

Yes, you are correct. It is a DLP 720p pico projector. The lumens is\n50.\n\nIt was an oversight not to call out the lumens and calling out 720p during the\ndesign phase of the website and we have not been able to updated the website\nto reflect the latest specs. The front facing camera is now 13 MP, which was a\nnew update, too.\n\nWe have a collateral sheet that calls out the lumens, 720P, contrast, aspect\nratio, 1280\u00d770 and auto focus.
