Embedded in\nconstitutions and championed by politicians and thinkers across the political\nspectrum, it is to many an absolute value, something beyond question. Yet how\nit emerged, and why, remains widely misunderstood.\n\nAccording to the conventional narrative, freedom of religion arose in the West\nin the wake of devastating wars fought over religion. It was catalysed by\npowerful arguments from thinkers such as John Locke, Baruch Spinoza, Pierre\nBayle and Voltaire. These philosophers and political theorists responded to\nthe brutality of the religious wars with support for radical notions of\ntoleration and religious freedom. Their liberal ideals then became embedded in\nthe political institutions of the West, following the American and French\nRevolutions.\n\nIn broad outline, such is the account accepted by most political philosophers\nand social scientists. But the evidence does not support this emphasis on the\npower of ideas in shaping the rise of religious freedom, and underestimates\nthe decisive role played by institutions.\n\nThe ideas of the philosophers were indeed important. In his Dictionnaire\nHistorique et Critique (1697), Bayle pointed out that if one religion claimed\nto be the only true faith, it by implication possessed the right to persecute\nall the others, and all other faiths possessed an equal right to make such a\nclaim. Showing the inherent volatility, for society, of such religious-truth\nclaims, Bayle also argued that if people turned out to be mistaken about their\nreligion, they could hardly be guilty of sin for nonetheless trying, in their\nsincerity, to observe its dictates.\n\nLocke argued that true faith could not be compelled. It followed, he claimed,\nthat restricting the rights of religious minorities should only be done for\nreasons of state, that is, not for reasons of faith or salvation. Voltaire\ntook a no less effective course, relentlessly documenting and mocking cases of\nreligious persecution. Time and again, he made zealots and enforcers of\nreligious dogma look ridiculous. These are compelling and consequential ideas,\nand worthy of continued study and reading.\n\nBut focusing on these ideas does not fully explain how religious freedom came\nto the West. The intellectual importance of Bayle, Locke and Voltaire does not\nmean that their ideas were central to religious freedom as it developed and\ncame to be in actual political and social life.\n\nWith my colleague at George Mason University, the economist Noel Johnson, I\nrecently completed the book Persecution and Toleration (2018), in which we\nshow that ideas were not enough to realise religious freedom. Crucially, it\ntook political and institutional changes \u2013 specifically, the growth and\nstrengthening of the ability of states to create and enforce rules \u2013 to make\nreligious freedom in the West possible and appealing. It wasn\u2019t the ideas of\nBayle or Spinoza or Locke driving the rise of state power, it was the need to\nraise resources for governing and war. For the rising fiscal-military state,\nreligious uniformity and persecution simply became too expensive and\ninefficient.\n\nMedieval Europe was characterised by multiple overlapping political boundaries\nand jurisdictions. These were not \u2018states\u2019 in the modern sense. Rulers were\nexpected only to enforce existing \u2018laws of the land\u2019, not to pass new laws.\nUsually, no taxes were raised \u2013 in normal times, rulers lived off the proceeds\nof their own lands. Armies were not permanent but rather raised in an ad hoc\nmanner as needed. Different territories and cities within a kingdom might have\ntheir own internal tariffs, regulations, and weights and measures. There was\nlittle in the way of a bureaucracy.\n\nLaws varied at a local level, and their enforcement typically depended upon an\nindividual\u2019s identity. Nobles were often exempt from taxation. Peasants had\ndifferent rights and obligations than city dwellers. Guilds controlled access\nto trade.\n\nDifferent rules and laws for different people are known as identity rules, and\nthey were the norm. Medieval polities relied on identity rules because they\nwere a low-cost form of governance. Medieval polities lacked the strength to\nenforce general rules, so it also made sense to rely upon identity rules.\n\nAt a deeper level, identity rules provided the glue that held the political\norder together. By treating individuals differently according to their legal\nstatus or religion, identity rules restricted economic competition between\ngroups and generated economic rents that could be siphoned off by the\npolitical elite. These rents were, in turn, used to maintain the\ndiscriminatory political order.\n\nMany of these discriminatory laws were based on religion. One example was\nJewish moneylending. Canon law prohibited Christians from lending money at\ninterest. But Jews were not subject to canon law. By enforcing this\nprohibition, rulers could tax the monopoly profits earned by Jewish\nmoneylenders. In turn, they offered Jews protection from violence, and the\nright to govern their own affairs.\n\nReligion also offered a potentially potent source of political legitimacy.\nModern states obtain legitimacy through democratic institutions or by\nproviding public goods and economic growth, while premodern states tended to\nrely more on religion.\n\nIn return for granting rulers political legitimacy, religious authorities\ncould require secular rulers to enforce religious conformity\n\nIt made sense for medieval states to rely on religious institutions to carry\nout administrative tasks for them, and to provide public goods. Religious\ninstitutions such as churches and monasteries in Europe, and waqfs and mosques\nin the Islamic world, provided education, poor relief and other public goods.\nCompared with non-religious organisations, they were better at excluding free-\nriders and attracting contributions from members.\n\nA partnership between church and state developed, a partnership with important\nconsequences for religious freedom in the premodern world. In return for\ngranting rulers political legitimacy, religious authorities could require\nsecular rulers to enforce religious conformity. The bargain appealed to\nsecular rulers too, as they believed that religious competition generated\npolitical instability.\n\nReligious conformity, and thus the persecution of religious dissent, came to\nbe tantamount to the maintenance of political order. In such a world,\nreligious freedom was inconceivable.\n\nThe nature of this political bargain is evident in the evolution of Martin\nLuther\u2019s views of religious freedom. When he first broke from Rome, Luther\nadvocated for religious freedom. In his early works, such as the Open Letter\nto the Christian Nobility (1520), he acknowledged the right of any believer to\nhis own private judgment, and argued against the compulsion of religious\nbelief. But Luther\u2019s position changed. The Peasants War of 1524-25 was the\nproximate cause of this change. He opposed religious freedom for Anabaptists,\nand then condemned the followers of his fellow reformer Huldrych Zwingli in\nSwitzerland. Luther\u2019s internal battles over religious freedom and those of his\ncontemporaries suggest that powerful forces were at work that seemed to\nnecessitate religious compulsion. He came to believe that religious conformity\n\u2013 to Lutheranism \u2013 should be required.\n\nThere\u2019s also the case of John Calvin and Michael Servetus. Servetus was a free\nthinker, notable in the history of medicine for discovering the function of\npulmonary circulation. He also denied the Trinity, which made him the enemy of\nboth Catholics and Protestants. Calvin colluded with the Catholic inquisitors\nof Vienne to persecute Servetus for heresy. When Servetus found himself in\nGeneva, Calvin pushed for his prosecution. Servetus was burned alive, to the\napplause of Protestant Europe.\n\nSebastian Castellio, a French theologian, criticised Calvin for the judicial\nmurder of Servetus, and in so doing made a powerful intellectual case for\nreligious toleration. Castellio\u2019s argument for religious toleration predates\nLocke and Bayle by a century and a half. But his writings had no real impact,\nand Castellio is not honoured as the champion of religious freedom that he\nwas.\n\nReligious freedom, however, was simply not tenable in the first part of the\n16th century. This was not simply due to dogmatism. People in the 18th century\nwere no smarter or more able to think through arguments in favour of\ntoleration than people in the 16th century. What was different was that\nreligion played a greater role in sustaining the 16th-century political order.\n\nSo what changed? Why did religious freedom come to the West? Why did Locke and\nVoltaire become heroes of religious freedom, but not Castellio? The answer\nlies in fundamental institutional changes that took place in European states\nbetween 1500 and 1800.\n\nThe first change was the transformation in the scale of European states. In\nthe late Middle Ages, medieval rulers began to invest in building\nadministrative capacity and to raise taxes more regularly. The most dramatic\ndevelopments, however, occurred after 1500, as a result of developments in\nmilitary technology that historians label the Military Revolution. This\ncontinent-wide arms race, brought on by the development of gunpowder, forced\nrulers to invest in greater fiscal and administrative capacity.\n\nTo pay for larger armies, new taxes had to be raised and a permanent system of\ngovernment borrowing established. Moreover, there was a shift away from ad\nhoc, feudal and decentralised tax systems, and a move towards standardisation\nand centralisation. Rather than relying upon tax farmers, the church or\nmerchant companies to raise taxes on their behalf, rulers invested in vast\nbureaucracies to do it directly. It was the only way they could pay for their\never-growing armies.\n\nThe size of European armies provides a sense of the scale of transformation.\nThe armies that contested the Hundred Years Wars between England and France\ngenerally numbered in the thousands. When the French assembled a force that\nsubstantially exceeded 10,000 men at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, this was\nan unusual event and, in any case, it was defeated by a much smaller English\nforce.\n\nBy the beginning of the 18th century, French and English commanders led\nbattlefield armies of up to 100,000. Under Louis XIV, the total size of the\nFrench army in the field was 400,000.\n\nPaying for these huge armies \u2013 and for the equally expensive navies that early\nmodern states built up \u2013 required significantly increased tax revenues.\nBetween the Glorious Revolution in 1688 and the conclusion of the Napoleonic\nWars in 1815, the tax revenue taken by the British state increased by a factor\nof 15. As total GDP grew by approximately a factor of three, this represented\na quintupling in the relative size of the state. Other European states also\nsucceeded in greatly increasing the amount of tax revenue they collected\n(though some, like France, could not do so at the rate required to keep up\nwith rising expenditures).\n\nThe dramatic institutional transformations attending these changes marks what\nis known as the rise of the fiscal-military state, the emergence of which set\nin motion large-scale costly wars. The formidable military and administrative\ncapacity of early modern states also meant that they had the power to hunt\ndown heretics more effectively than their medieval predecessors. Rulers such\nas the Habsburg Philip II in the Netherlands and Mary I in England burned\nhundreds of individuals for their religious beliefs.\n\nFor states with bureaucracies and professional tax collectors, it was simply\nless costly to treat everyone equally\n\nHowever, the long-run impact of these changes undermined religion as a tool of\npolitical legitimation, and worked to replace the old reliance on identity\nrules with more general laws. The new modern states that emerged in Europe\nafter 1600 subordinated all alternative sources of power \u2013 the nobility and\nthe church \u2013 to one sovereign authority. Religious legitimation became less\nimportant as a source of political legitimacy, and the grand bargain between\nchurch and state weakened. As they relied less on religious authority, states\ngrew less inclined to value enforcing religious conformity.\n\nCardinal Richelieu illustrates these developments. Richelieu destroyed the\nindependent power of the nobility in France; he greatly expanded the power of\nthe monarchy; and, though a cardinal, he elevated the interests of France\nabove those of the Catholic faith. A crucial part of this achievement involved\nthe destruction of the independent military power of the Huguenots, or French\nProtestants. As Richelieu crushed the Huguenot \u2018state within the state\u2019, he\nalso guaranteed their right to worship according to the Protestant creed.\nReligion was to be a private activity rather than an alternative source of\npolitical power. Quite simply, greater religious freedom came at the price of\npolitical power for religion.\n\nThe process of centralisation and bureaucratisation brought other important\nconsequences. It meant that identity rules had to be abandoned. In their\nplace, states instituted more general rules. Guilds lost their monopoly\nprivileges. Legal systems became increasingly standardised; taxes more\nregularised. For states with bureaucracies and professional tax collectors, it\nwas simply less costly to treat everyone equally. Discriminatory rules against\nCatholics, Protestants or Jews either became redundant over time or were\neventually done away with. Though gradual and fitful, this levelling process\nproved inexorable and, in the long-run, irreversible.\n\nSome states attempted to strictly enforce religious conformity. Habsburg Spain\ninstituted the Inquisition and expelled its Jewish and Muslim populations.\nLouis XIV threw the Huguenots out of France. But these attempts to return to\nthe medieval world of religious uniformity proved costly mistakes and helped\nto weaken the regimes and states that undertook them.\n\nThe establishment of relatively powerful and \u2018secular\u2019 states that no longer\nrequired religious legitimation shifted the political equilibrium in favour of\nreligious freedom and dismantled the old system of identity rules. Once this\ninstitutional change had taken place, elite opinion shifted in favour of\nreligious freedom.\n\nThe case of Jewish emancipation provides an important example of how,\nhistorically, religious freedom actually happened. In 1782, the Habsburg\nemperor Joseph II issued one of the first edicts of toleration for Jews in\ncontinental Europe. The act granted certain civic rights to Jews on the\nproviso that they be integrated with the rest of the population as active\ncitizens. It stopped short of offering Jews full equality, but represented a\nradical change in the way in which Jews had been treated. The impetus towards\nemancipation came less from commitment to the principle of religious equality\nthan from a recognition that maintaining the old reliance on identity rules\nimposed considerable economic and political costs. Joseph II was persuaded by\nthe writings of Christian Wilhelm von Dohm, who had argued that the existing\nregulations hemmed in Jewish life, making Jewish people unproductive as\ncitizens and as workers. Freeing the Jews from discriminatory laws, he argued,\nwould bolster the economy.\n\nJoseph\u2019s reforms were controversial. But Revolutionary France adopted a\nsimilar policy, and soon exported it to much of the rest of Europe. The\nresults of this transformation were dramatic. Previously, Jews had been\nexcluded from most industries and professions; they were barred from the\nuniversities, from law, and from guild membership. As a result, Jews had been\nlargely confined to trades such as moneylending and peddling, and the majority\nof central European Jews lived in ghettos, and were poor and impoverished.\nAfter emancipation, this changed within a generation. Jews entered higher\neducation, industry and commerce on a large scale.\n\nThis increase in religious freedom also transformed Europe\u2019s cultural and\nintellectual life. Between the Middle Ages and the modern era, Jewish\nintellectual culture had in many ways fallen behind that of Christian Europe \u2013\nnotwithstanding the occasional exceptional genius such as Spinoza or Moses\nMendelssohn. The emancipation of Europe\u2019s Jewish community gave rise to a\ntremendous flourishing of intellectual and artistic achievement among Jews\nthat greatly enriched European society.\n\nReligious freedom began to seem less like a recipe for social disorder and\ncivil war, and more like a win-win proposition\n\nEconomic changes complemented the rise of religious freedom, most notably the\nonset of modern economic growth. As in the Jewish example, greater freedom\nallowed religious minorities to flourish. French Protestants expelled by Louis\nXIV brought with them advanced skills and industrial expertise to England, the\nNetherlands and Prussia. In Industrial Revolution Britain, Quakers and other\nreligious dissenters were overrepresented among businessmen, entrepreneurs and\ninnovators.\n\nThe indirect consequences of moving from identity rules to general rules were\neven more important. Identity rules had limited the scope of trade and the\ndivision of labour. As these identity rules were removed \u2013 as guilds lost\nauthority, and cities and lords lost their ability to charge internal tariffs\n\u2013 trade and commerce expanded.\n\nThe growth of trade, in turn, reinforced the trend towards liberalism. Trade,\nas Enlightenment thinkers such as Montesquieu argued, encouraged individuals\nto see the world through the positive-sum lens of mutual beneficial\ninteraction rather than through the zero-sum lens of conflict. Religious\nfreedom began to seem less like a recipe for social disorder and civil war,\nand more like a win-win proposition.\n\nWhat implications does our argument have for the modern world? Most important\nperhaps is the need to recognise that liberal ideas were not necessarily\nresponsible for the emergence of liberal societies. Instead, the rise of a new\ntype of political organisation, the modern state, led, for its own reasons, to\nrulers enforcing general rules of behaviour \u2013 rules incompatible with\nreligious discrimination.\n\nProtestants often see the Reformation as explaining the origins of religious\nfreedom. But the example of Calvin and Castellio suggests that Protestantism\nitself did not point the way to religious freedom. American national mythology\noften attributes the origins of religious freedom to the Puritans who fled\npersecution in England and settled in New England. But the Puritans believed\nin religious freedom only for Puritans; they were stricter enforcers of\nreligious conformity than many European states. The actual adoption of any\nmeaningful practice of religious freedom followed neither from the arguments\nof philosophers, nor from the nature of Protestant belief, but from the\npolitical impossibility of achieving conformity after 1600 as Protestantism\ngrew more and more sectarian.\n\nFinally, the history of how religious freedom came to be is a reminder that\ncommitment to liberal values alone is not enough for liberalism to flourish.\nIt requires a suitable political and economic foundation. As the experience of\n1930s Germany suggests, religious persecution can quickly re-emerge. We cannot\nrely on liberal ideas alone to be effective. If we value religious freedom,\nand other achievements of liberalism, we must look to the vitality of their\ninstitutional foundations.\n\nHistoryReligionWar and peace\n\n28 August 2017\n\nEmail\n\nSave\n\nPost\n\nShare\n\nSyndicate this essay\n\nSave\n\nessay\n\nHuman rights and justice\n\nMy elusive pain\n\nThe lives of North Africans in France are shaped by a harrowing struggle to\nbelong, marked by postcolonial trauma\n\nFarah Abdessamad\n\nSave\n\nessay\n\nReligion\n\nConscientious unbelievers\n\nHow, a century ago, radical freethinkers quietly and persistently subverted\nScotland\u2019s Christian establishment\n\nFelicity Loughlin\n\nSave\n\nessay\n\nHistory of technology\n\nWhy America fell for guns\n\nThe US today has extraordinary levels of gun ownership.
