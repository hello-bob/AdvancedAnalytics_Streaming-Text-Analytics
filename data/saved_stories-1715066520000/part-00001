Send Help.\n\n## If your media diet looked like his, you\u2019d be red-pilled too.\n\n  * ### Tim Murphy\n\nNational CorrespondentBio | Follow\n\n  * Share on Facebook\n  * Share on Twitter\n  * Email\n  * Print\n  * Comments\n\nMother Jones illustration; Michel Euler/AP\n\nFight disinformation: Sign up for the free Mother Jones Daily newsletter and\nfollow the news that matters.\n\nLast January, not long after agreeing with an actual Nazi that western Jews\nhave brought antisemitism upon themselves by welcoming \u201chordes of minorities\u201d\nto their countries, Elon Musk took a quick trip to Poland. The billionaire\nchief of SpaceX, Tesla, and X laid a wreath at Auschwitz and then preceded on\nto a symposium in Krakow, where he told the conservative commentator Ben\nShapiro that social media could have averted the Holocaust and bragged that he\nconsidered himself \u201caspirationally Jewish.\u201d The tweet, he explained in a\ndifferent interview, at a different symposium \u201cmight be literally the worst\nand dumbest post I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d But he did not take it down, nor has he\nmoderated his views. If anything his descent into the online fever swamp has\nonly accelerated.\n\nIt is hard to appreciate just how thoroughly one of the world\u2019s richest men\nhas been red-pilled until you actually follow along with his media diet. So\nthat\u2019s what I decided to do. Last month, I read everything Musk had to say on\nX for a week and tracked everyone he interacted with. He tweeted 389 times in\nfive days. He posted the laughing/crying emoji 45 times. But there was a clear\nsignal piercing through the noise. Musk is not a tech visionary with a side\ninterest in politics these days, nor is he just another bored billionaire with\na nativist streak; the political activism and the technological ambitions are\ninseparable. He believes his work is part of a civilizational struggle in\nwhich woke progressives pose an existential threat to humanity. And he spends\nmost of his days inside a feedback loop that\u2019s radicalizing him even more.\n\nOver the course of the week, Musk dabbled in a range of small-scale freakouts\nand smoldering obsessions. He sent 13 tweets about Brazil\u2019s supreme court, as\npart of a weeks-long battle with the government over efforts to censor\ndisinformation and hate speech. He twice promoted a statistic about the murder\nrate among Black Americans. He spent one afternoon earnestly amplifying a\nfollower who claimed that \u201cOver 1,000 African migrants have taken over NYC\u2019s\nCity Hall.\u201d (It was an overflow crowd for a hearing on racial disparities in\nthe shelter system.) But one subject came to drown out all the rest. During\nthe week Tesla recalled its CyberTruck for a faulty accelerator pedal, Musk\u2019s\nmost urgent public concern was Katherine Maher.\n\nMusk tweeted about Maher, the CEO of National Public Radio who formerly served\nas executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation, nearly 60 times. It began\nrelatively simply, with Musk lamenting the resignation of Uri Berliner, a\nformer NPR staffer who wrote a critical essay about what he considered the\nmedia outlet\u2019s leftward drift. Then Manhattan Institute fellow Chris Rufo\u2014the\nconservative strategist who helped orchestarate the backlash to Critical Race\nTheory\u2014began dredging up old comments from Maher, in which she talked about\ncorrecting for white historical biases at Wikipedia and pushing back against\ndisinformation at NPR. \u201cKatherine Maher is blatantly racist and sexist \u2013 one\nof the worst human beings in America,\u201d Musk tweeted at Rufo. \u201cShe\u2019s evil,\u201d he\ntweeted again, one minute later.\n\nMusk is not a tech visionary with a side interest in politics these days, nor\nis he just another bored billionaire with a nativist streak; the political\nactivism and the technological ambitions are inseparable.\n\nRufo and the Canadian behavioral marketing guru Gad Saad are two of Musk\u2019s\nfavorite sounding boards when it comes to wokeness. From Rufo, Musk learns\nwhat he should be mad about\u2014clips of Maher speaking to the Atlantic Council,\nclips of Maher delivering a Ted Talk, screenshots of Maher\u2019s old tweets. From\nSaad, he gets a more holistic intellectual framework for being mad. Musk is\nobsessed with the idea that a \u201cwoke mind virus\u201d is infecting society. Saad\nhappens to be the author of a book called The Parasitic Mind, which Musk has\nsaid gave him \u201cnightmares.\u201d In March, a few months after Saad tweeted at Musk\nto ask him to promote the book, they held a glitchy 38-minute public\ndiscussion on X Spaces. The billionaire has continued to plug the\nbook\u2014including three different times in the week I tuned in.\n\nIf you only pay glancing attention to Musk, it\u2019s tough to fully grasp both the\nintensity and shallowness of his conservative convictions. I knew that he\npreviously said that the rise of Artificial Intelligence could bring about\n\u201ccivilizational destruction,\u201d but I had, in my ignorance, assumed that this\nfear stemmed from a simple Matrix-style kind of doomism: Machines will grow\nsentient and enslave us. The reality, which became clear as Musk\u2019s fixation\nwith Maher progressed, was a bit darker: He believes AI will destroy the world\nwith wokeness.\n\nIt was a \u201csevere civilization-level risk,\u201d Musk wrote in a late-night exchange\nwith the billionaire venture-capitalist Marc Andreesen. (Andreesen\u2019s own\nspiraling antipathy toward progressive buzzwords like \u201csustainability\u201d and\n\u201csocial responsibility\u201d has made him a leading proponent of Effective\nAccelerationism\u2014sort of the anti-woke mind virus.)\n\n\u201cNow imagine if this is programmed, explicitly or implicitly, into super\npowerful AI \u2013 it could end civilization,\u201d he said in response to a Rufo tweet\nabout Maher\u2019s TED Talk, in which she discusses how Wikipedia moderators think\nabout truth when it comes to thorny subjects like religion. \u201cNow, no need to\nimagine. It is already programmed into Google Gemini and OpenAI ChatGPT.\u201d\n\nMusk returned to the theme of civilization-destroying woke AI throughout the\nweek. \u201cImagine if instead of merely rendering forced \u2018diverse\u2019 images,\u201d he\nsaid in reply to a follower with the handle DogeDesigner, \u201cit decided to make\nthat true in reality, potentially killing millions of people to achieve\ndiversity goals.\u201d\n\nImagine! With those stakes, everything fits in this heroic or apocalyptic\ndichotomy.\n\n\u201c[T]he West...wishes to be eaten alive and to have its children sacrificed\nbecause then death could be the ultimate expression of its progressive\npurity,\u201d Saad wrote toward the beginning of the week.\n\n\u201cSuicidal empathy for the L,\u201d Musk agreed.\n\nAll of this might sound familiar. That\u2019s because it\u2019s a facet of the same\ncomplaint that led to his remedial education at Auschwitz last year, stripped\nof the most obvious antisemitic signifiers: Woke progressives are opening the\ndoors to the forces that will destroy us all: Falling birth rates, gender\nideology, flag-burning immigrants, socially-conscious AI. There was a basic\nfallacy in expecting a tour about the horrors of genocide to soften the views\nof someone currently worried about \u201cwhite genocide\u201d and civil war, and who\nbelieves the ideology of his critics could lead to millions of deaths.\n\nMusk described the current state of his red-pilling, and how all-encompassing\nit is, most succinctly in a response to Rufo about a five-year-old tweet from\nMaher about feeling \u201cdeep discomfort\u201d about having children.\n\n\u201cOnce you see that the true battle is expansionists vs extinctionists,\u201d he\nwrote, \u201cyou can\u2019t unsee it.\u201d\n\nAnd once you see that Musk truly can\u2019t see anything else, you can\u2019t unsee\nthat. Still, there are some things Musk does want AI to kill off. The emerging\ntech is a boon to Musk not just because of what it promises for his companies,\nbut because of what he hopes it can replace. \u201cLegacy media simply can\u2019t\ncompete with hundreds of millions of humans providing real-time, AI-assisted,\ninteractive information,\u201d he boasted, responding to a chart from DogeDesigner\nshowing declining traffic at major news sites. Musk is doing his part. His\nfeed looks like a newsroom after private equity came to town\u2014one of the only\narticles from a legacy media outlet he shared all week was a New York Post\nstory about X\u2019s advertising situation, and the only reporter from a legacy\nnews outlet he interacted with was Bill Melugin, Fox News\u2019 man on the border.\n\nA lot of his time is just spent saying the same grim things, to the same grim\npeople, over and over. He has the mannerism not of a master of the universe,\nbut of the reply guys clamoring for their attention.\n\nMusk touts his platform as the future of news even as he uses it to spread\nmisinformation. Not long after taking over the platform, he shared\u2014and later\ndeleted\u2014a report from a notorious fake-news site that falsely asserted that\nNancy\u2019s Pelosi\u2019s husband, Paul, had not been brutally attacked by a home\ninvader and instead had gotten in a fight with a male prostitute.\nCommunicating in emojis and exclamation marks makes it harder to commit\nfactual errors, but he still made some. Musk twice expressed his alarm at a\ntoo-good-to-check story about a non-profit that works with migrants in Mexico\nhanding out flyers asking them to vote for Joe Biden when they get to the\nUnited States. The non-profit said it had nothing to do with the flyers, and\nthe text appeared to have been crudely translated using an online app. The\nallegation, which originated with a right-wing site called Muckraker.com, was\namplified by the Heritage Foundation and found its way to Musk by way of both\nthe Heritage Foundation and Nate Hochman, a Republican writer and activist who\nwas fired from Ron DeSantis\u2019 presidential campaign after featuring a Nazi\nsymbol in a campaign video. It may seem like a small thing, but there\u2019s no\nsuch thing when it comes to truth\u2014I\u2019m told the future of civilization hangs in\nthe balance.\n\nA lot of his time is just spent saying the same grim things, to the same grim\npeople, over and over. He has the mannerism not of a master of the universe,\nbut of the reply guys clamoring for their attention. Musk tweeted \u201cDefundNPR\u201d\nat Rufo three times in two days, like a man at a ballpark by himself, trying\nto start the wave. He will sometimes respond to the same post multiple times,\nhours apart with a slightly different reaction. One of the big stories last\nweek in Musk\u2019s circle was a report from the popular account End Wokeness that\nthe actress Naomi Watts has a daughter who is trans.\n\n\u201cFunny how so many progressive actors have children who are transgender,\u201d Gad\nSaad wrote.\n\n\u201cTerrible,\u201d Musk said.\n\n\u201c\u2018A \u2018trans\u2019 child is the ultimate Hollywood virtue signal, meaning EXTRA\napproval. Two is even better. 3 is god mode,\u201d said a finance influencer and\nself-described Tesla shareholder, a few hours later.\n\n\u201cYup,\u201d said Musk.\n\nIt is hard to overstate that this is just what one of the most powerful men in\nthe world does all day. It is the media diet of one of those influencers who\nonly eats organ meat. At least Howard Hughes kept out of sight. But even\namidst this right-wing emoji-storm, there were still occasional glimpses of\nthe Musk who, until fairly recently, enjoyed a less polarizing reputation as a\nbillionaire who built cool stuff. He does talk a lot about SpaceX, although\nthose interstellar ambitions take on a different light when you realize his\nquest is now part of a civilization struggle against pronouns. If you catch\nhim at the right moment, you can still find Musk sharing math jokes, politely\nengaging with people with product complaints, and offering unsolicited medical\nadvice. \u201cIf you\u2019re experiencing severe neck/back pain, I recommend looking\ninto a disc replacement,\u201d he suggested. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s good advice or\nnot, but I do at least get where he\u2019s coming from.\n\nOnce, in the course of 389 tweets, the father of 11 even talked about what\nit\u2019s like to be a parent.\n\n\u201cWhoa, I just realized that raising a kid is basically 18 years of prompt\nengineering ,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cOur first child will be born next month \u2013 what\u2019s your biggest piece of\nadvice?\u201d a former Tesla employee asked in response.\n\nIt was right there for him on a platter\u2014a chance to be normal. What would it\nbe: Treasure every moment? Stock up on wipes?\n\n\u201cBe super careful about what schools teach your kids,\u201d Musk replied.\n\nNever mind.\n\n### Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly\nto your inbox.\n\nClose\n\nThank you for subscribing!\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use, and to\nreceive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\n### AN IMPORTANT UPDATE\n\nWe\u2019re falling behind our online fundraising goals and we can\u2019t sustain coming\nup short on donations month after month.
