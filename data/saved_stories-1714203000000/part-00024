Braid, Anniversary Edition is an updated version of the classic game\nBraid that came out way back in 2008. The update has improved graphics and\nsound, new puzzles and developer commentary. Over 15 hours of commentary\nsurvived the editing and selection process to make it into the game, but this\ncame from over 60 hours of initially recorded audio. Thus, this podcast. Our\nfirst interviewer is Casey Muratori, who some of you may know as the author of\nthe Substack Computer, Enhance!, where he teaches programming. He's also the\ncreator of the widely-appreciated YouTube series Handmade Hero. One lesser\nknown fact is that Casey helped inspire Braid originally, and we'll be\ndiscussing his contributions throughout this podcast.
