Ever-growing tensions in the South China Sea all point to an uncomfortable truth for Southeast Asian nations, as well as the U.S.: In this standoff, China is winning. | Pool / via REUTERS\n\nBy Philip Heijmans Bloomberg\n\nSHARE\n\nTwitter Facebook LinkedIn Email Print\n\nApr 24, 2024\n\nThis was supposed to be the year that Vietnam reaped the benefits from one of\nits largest natural gas discoveries.\n\nAn estimated 150 billion cubic meters of the fuel, enough to power a city the\nsize of Hanoi for decades, was discovered 80 kilometers from Vietnam\u2019s central\ncoast in 2011. If all had gone to plan, the \"Blue Whale\u201d project led by Exxon\nMobil would have gone online late last year.\n\nOn the other side of the South China Sea, the Philippines has long eyed the\nenergy riches off its western coast as a way to reduce its growing reliance on\nimported gas and oil, with successive governments drafting projects to tap\ninto those resources and bolster the nation\u2019s energy security.\n\nIn a time of both misinformation and too much information, quality journalism\nis more crucial than ever.
