Left shows an image of a piece of sky observed with the\nhitherto best calibration technique. Right shows the same piece of sky with\nthe new technique. More detail is visible, and what were once large, blurry\npatches now appear as single points. Credit: LOFAR/Groeneveld et al.\n\nAn international team of researchers led by astronomers from Leiden University\n(Netherlands) has produced the first sharp radio maps of the universe at low\nfrequencies. Thanks to a new calibration technique, they bypassed the\ndisturbances of the Earth's ionosphere. They have used the new method to study\nplasmas from ancient black hole bursts. Potentially, the technique might be\nuseful for finding exoplanets that orbit small stars.\n\nThe researchers report their technique in the journal Nature Astronomy.\n\nThe technique allowed astronomers to take clear radio images of the universe\nat frequencies between 16 and 30 MHz for the first time. This was thought to\nbe impossible, because the ionosphere, at about 80 kilometers above the Earth,\ninterferes with observations at these frequencies.\n\nThe researchers used the LOFAR telescope in Drenthe, the Netherlands. This is\ncurrently one of the best low-frequency radio telescopes in the world. To test\ntheir technique, they studied a number of galaxy clusters that had previously\nonly been studied in detail at higher frequencies.\n\nThanks to the new images, it appears that the radio emission from these\nclusters is not evenly distributed across the entire cluster, but rather there\nis a spot pattern. \"It's like putting on a pair of glasses for the first time\nand no longer seeing blurred,\" said research leader Christian Groeneveld of\nLeiden University.\n\nThe motivation for the research was that at high frequencies, around 150 MHz,\nmany improvements in calibration had already been made in recent years.\n\n\"We hoped that we could also extend this technique to lower frequencies, below\n30 MHz,\" says the originator of the idea, Reinout van Weeren of Leiden\nUniversity. \"And we succeeded.\"\n\nAt the moment, the researchers are processing more data in order to map the\nentire northern sky at the lower frequencies.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the new calibration technique makes it possible\nto study phenomena that were previously hidden. It might be used to detect\nexoplanets orbiting small stars. And, Groeneveld concludes, \"There is, of\ncourse, a chance that we will eventually discover something unexpected.\"\n\nMore information: C.
