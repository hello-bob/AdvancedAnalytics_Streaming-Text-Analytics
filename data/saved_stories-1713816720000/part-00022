These flybys provided the closest look ever at Jupiter's\ninnermost large moon. Io hosts hundreds of active volcanoes. According to\nNASA, their eruptions are sometimes so powerful that they can be seen with\ntelescopes on Earth.\n\nThe new images show Loki Patera, a 127-mile-long (200 km) lava lake on Io's\nsurface. Scientists have been observing this lava lake for decades. It sits\nover the magma reservoirs under Io's surface. The cooling lava at the center\nof the lake is ringed by possibly molten magma around the edges, Scott Bolton,\nprincipal investigator for the Juno mission, said during a news conference\nWednesday (April 16) at the European Geophysical Union General Assembly in\nVienna.\n\n\"The specular reflection our instruments recorded of the lake suggests parts\nof Io's surface are as smooth as glass, reminiscent of volcanically created\nobsidian glass on Earth,\" Bolton said.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM livescience\n\nRugged islands of rock crowd the lava lake's interior. \"There is amazing\ndetail showing these crazy islands embedded in the middle of a potentially\nmagma lake rimmed with hot lava,\" Bolton said.\n\nRelated: Uranus and Neptune aren't made of what we thought, new study hints\n\nrelated stories\n\n\u2014NASA unveils cryptic message from Earth to be sent to Jupiter's icy ocean\nmoon Europa\n\n\u2014Jupiter's moon Europa lacks oxygen, making it less hospitable for sustaining\nlife\n\n\u2014An eerie look at Io, the most volcanic world in the solar system\n\nJuno's instruments have determined that Io's surface is smoother than the\nsurfaces of Jupiter's three other Galilean moons (Europa, Ganymede and\nCallisto). Io is slightly larger than Earth's moon, and the surfaces that\naren't molten are largely covered with yellow sulfur and sulfur dioxide.\n\n## Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nJuno continues to fly over Jupiter, collecting data about its dramatic polar\ncyclones, each of which is the width of the continental U.S. The mission is\nalso measuring levels of oxygen and hydrogen in Jupiter's atmosphere. The\nspacecraft will complete its 61st flyby of Jupiter on May 12.\n\nStephanie Pappas\n\nLive Science Contributor\n\nStephanie Pappas is a contributing writer for Live Science, covering topics\nranging from geoscience to archaeology to the human brain and behavior.
