It's fast. And it's fun!\n\nTerraform or Bust?\n\nHas your organization used or evaluated a Terraform alternative since new\nrestrictions were placed on its licensing?\n\nWe have used Terraform, but are now piloting or using an open source\nalternative like OpenTofu.\n\nWe never used Terraform, but have recently piloted or used alternatives.\n\nWe don't use Terraform and don't plan to use or evaluate alternatives.\n\nWe use Terraform and are satisfied with the results\n\nWe are waiting to see what IBM will do with Terraform.\n\nWe'd love to hear what you think.\n\nLet me start by briefly explaining what a cloud development environment (CDE)\nis. Typically running a Linux OS with applications, it offers a preconfigured\nenvironment that allows for coding, compilation and other operations similar\nto a local environment. From an implementation standpoint, such an environment\nis akin to a remotely running process, often virtualized through technologies\nlike Docker or Podman. For a general overview of CDEs, check this article.\n\nCDE technology is driving the fastest DevOps transformation trend today with\nthe entire cloud native development industry moving development environments\nonline. These environments became one of Gartner\u2019s new technology categories\nin August 2023. Notably, Gartner expects over 60% of cloud workloads to be\nbuilt and deployed using CDEs by 2026.\n\nToday, organizations can decide to manage them with a self-hosted platform, or\nuse one of the services attached to a cloud provider when available. Yet,\noverall, platforms that manage these environments are in their infancy, and\ntheir features widely differ across vendors. Hence, there is a great deal of\nflexibility on how to implement the technology and, most importantly, what\nbusiness use cases should it cover.\n\nWhen faced with choosing a platform for CDEs, businesses should opt for one\nthat delivers both productivity and data security. Using a secure cloud\ndevelopment environment, meaning one that provides data security, allows\norganizations to deploy mechanisms that are quite diverse, for example\nprotecting against data exfiltration and infiltration, automating DevSecOps\nbest-practices or generating security reviews.\n\nThis type of security is typically the aim of a virtual desktop infrastructure\nby Citrix or, more recently, the goal of using an enterprise browser (Island,\nTalon or Chrome Enterprise).\n\nA reason for that is many companies, including technology companies, have\nsuffered attacks on their assets such as source code, customer data and other\nintellectual property. Recent high-profile cases around source-code leaks\ninclude Slack\u2019s GitHub repositories, CircleCI and Okta in December 2022. Most\nimportantly I find it important that security should be positioned as a\nproductivity booster so that it contributes to an improved developer\nexperience, as opposed to being an impediment.\n\nOne of the common denominators between existing platforms is the aim to make\ncode development more efficient. Whether or not you choose to consider\nsecurity in the mix, it is clear that CDEs can potentially unleash a great\namount of productivity that benefits a DevOps workflow.\n\nTRENDING STORIES\n\n  1.

Key Infrastructure Takeaways from Google Cloud Next 2024\n  5. If Dev and Ops Had a Baby \u2014 It Would Be Called Winglang\n\nThis is the reason why I take here a fresh look at DevOps\u2019 core principles and\nrethink how these environments can shed a new light on them. These principles\nare also referred to as the three ways and are explained in \u201cThe DevOps\nHandbook,\u201d by Gene Kim, Patrick Debois and John Willis.\n\nBefore we start, if you want to understand the difference between a platform\nto manage data-secure CDEs and other platforms, you can look at this article.\n\n## Online Environments Accelerate DevOps\u2019 Principle of Flow\n\nFrom a process perspective, DevOps is about implementing the three principles\n(or ways): namely the principles of flow, feedback and continuous learning.\nExplaining the benefits of CDEs in this context is a good way to understand\nsome of their key impacts.\n\nZoom\n\nDevOps\u2019 three ways \u2014 flow, feedback and continuous learning \u2014 as pictured in\n\u201cThe DevOps Handbook.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s start with the principle of flow. The first principle emphasizes the\nsmooth and efficient movement of work from development through testing,\ndeployment down to operations and monitoring. It aims to minimize bottlenecks,\noptimize processes and enable a continuous and seamless delivery pipeline. The\nflow is often represented with the series of stages arranged along the\ninfinity sign.\n\nCDEs are an efficient way to implement the principle of flow, because they\nallow users to have fully isolated workspace settings when dealing with\nmultiple projects, enabling straightforward and impactless context switching\nbetween them.\n\nA good CDE platform provides developers with multiple tools to manage and\nconfigure their CDEs, in particular, based on company policies. For example,\nself-service access to CDEs for developers is an important benefit.\n\nCDEs are also easily replicated for testing and can be reassigned across users\nas necessary. They can be fully templated, provisioned within seconds on\npliant resources and accessed by any developer regardless of their location.\nHere, a good CDE platform offers comprehensive operations to project and IT\nmanagers that enable CDE management and observability at scale.\n\nZoom\n\nThe use of CDEs starts at the DevOps code stage and enables organizations to\nmaintain consistent environments across stages. A CDE and its access\nmechanisms are represented by a tile and a series of icons, respectively.\n\nClearly, the online deployment of CDEs allows centralized management,\nobservability and access in such a way that it enhances DevOps\u2019 principle of\nflow.\n\nToday the inclusion of remote developers is part of most organization\u2019s\noperations. The online nature of CDEs is great for onboarding developers on\nfully configured environments, regardless of their location. Providing access\nto the organizations\u2019 resources is also an important aspect of onboarding.\n\nHere, CDEs provide a new opportunity to access development resources in a\ncentralized manner, in particular one that offers enhanced control and\nobservability.\n\nTo couple productivity with flexibility, a good CDE platform must provide an\naccess permission model to resources that allows handling different types of\ndevelopers, different scenarios of development (internal, collaborative, etc.)\nand different types of resources. For example, a role-based and attribute-\nbased access control (RBAC/ABAC) coupled with a mechanism to classify\nresources enables organizations to set up risk controls and ensure governance\neven in complex workflow situations. This greatly enhances the possibility to\ndesign efficient and collaborative development flows.\n\nZoom\n\nOnboarding a diverse set of developers requires a mechanism to manage access\npermission to resources based on role. Permissions can also be assessed\ndynamically based on properties such as the user location.\n\nFinally, one of the great aspects of the joint use of CDEs and web-based IDEs\nis that onboarding developers on thin devices or in BYOD mode becomes an\nimmediate accelerator for business expansion.\n\n## How to Bring Immediacy to DevOps\u2019 Principle of Feedback\n\nThe principle of feedback involves establishing mechanisms for communication\nand collaboration between different stages of the development and operations\nprocesses. This includes collecting feedback from various sources, such as end\nusers, monitoring systems and testing processes. An important aspect of this\nprinciple is that it enables better collaboration between developers.\n\nRealizing the second principle of DevOps is best exemplified with the pull\nrequest (PR) mechanism implemented in code repository applications. By using a\nPR, developers can provide comments on the work submitted from a branch before\nit is merged into the application.\n\nThe online nature of CDEs brings the principle of feedback even closer to the\ndeveloper, before work reaches the code repository, right at the center of the\ncoding activity. This benefit is realized by the CDEs often being in\nconjunction with the mechanisms to access or monitor them, such as the IDE,\nterminal, network, orchestration, etc.\n\nBecause CDEs are online running processes, it is easy to observe the work as\nit\u2019s being done. This is reminiscent of observing the user experience of\nwebsites\u2019 visitors. In my opinion, this is the area where there is the most\nopportunity for bringing productivity and security to the core of the\ndevelopment.\n\nZoom\n\nBecause CDEs can be accessed remotely, it is easy to measure some of their\nproperties such as running processes and allocated resources.\n\nFor example, it is easy to measure in real time, over a fleet of CDEs, such as\nthose shared by developers working on a common project, the average\ncompilation time necessary to build the application (see the figure above).\nThis brings immediate and valuable information to the project manager about\nproductivity.\n\nIt is also easy to look at the information passing through the developers\u2019\nclipboard and the CDE\u2019s network traffic. Using these channels, we can provide\nfeedback to developers and managers. For example, from an infrastructure\nsecurity perspective it is easy to monitor for potential data exfiltration and\nprevent loss of intellectual property.\n\nBut through the same channel, one can also look for potential infiltration of\npernicious data. For example, imagine that you can detect a credential inside\na developer\u2019s clipboard. Why not inquire about the intention of the developer\nperforming this operation?\n\nThe same is possible when a developer is about to paste source code collected\nfrom a random website inside your codebase. Would you like to flag it and\nautomate the creation of a security review? What about detecting malware\nbefore it reaches your codebase or systematically flagging AI-generated code?\n\nZoom\n\nThe control on CDEs and their supporting infrastructure is an opportunity to\nsemantically analyze input data such as credentials, licensed source code and\npotential malware. Similarly, it allows for setting data leak prevention\nmeasures.\n\nClearly CDEs and the infrastructure components that are used to funnel data\ninto them are ways to bring a new crop of best practices to DevOps and\nDevSecOps and revisit DevOps\u2019 principle of feedback. Through the examples that\nI gave above, you can see that infrastructure security can liaise with the\nprinciple of code security!\n\nA good CDE platform will provide an artillery of new and creative DevOps and\nDevSecOps automations. In addition there is a great opportunity to revisit\nstandardized and accepted metrics such as DORA and SPACE to bring them closer\nto the activity that developers spend the most time on: writing code in the\nIDE.\n\n## Close-up on the Principle of Continuous Learning\n\nLet\u2019s finish this discussion with the third principle \u2014 continuous learning.\nThis principle underscores the importance of fostering a culture of ongoing\nimprovement and learning within the development and operations teams. It\ninvolves regularly gathering feedback, analyzing performance metrics and\nincorporating lessons learned from each stage of the development and\ndeployment process to enhance efficiency and innovation.\n\nThe immediacy of web platforms and the opportunity they bring around the\nobservability of their running business processes also enables organizations\nto learn about themselves. This is a boon to increase the potential of\ncontinuous learning.\n\nInitially, DevOps\u2019 expectations on continuous learning were around bettering\napplications in operation, such as those in use by the customer. But when the\nentire development process is run as a cloud application, there are many\nvaluable things that organization can learn about their own platform-based\ndevelopment process.\n\nAlong that vein, CDE platforms bring a new level of observability and allow\nbusiness optimization around several critical areas. I have discussed how\norganizations can learn about their performance around application delivery\nand its security posture. But they can also learn about cloud and physical\nassets\u2019 utilization, as well as monitor the cost of IT functions and resources\nallotted to development.\n\nThe platform also brings a fantastic opportunity to centralize the\nimplementation of productivity and risk controls while systematically\nenforcing them across geographically scattered teams. In practice, modern CDE\nplatforms need to allow the simultaneous use of multiple clouds across\nmultiple regions. Most importantly, their capability to uniformly deliver\ncomplex services to organizations makes it easy to implement governance\nmechanisms that do not get in the way of users\u2019 daily tasks.\n\nZoom\n\nDevOps\u2019 principle of continuous learning can also apply to the development\nprocess itself. CDEs yield a new swath of process measurements that benefit\ngovernance, accountability and risk controls.\n\nIn conclusion, good CDE platforms should bring a wealth of metrics and\nfunctionalities to organizations such that they retake control of a\ndevelopment process that is often scattered and non-uniform across hardware\nand applications, and at times obscured from a security perspective. This is\nwhy, in my opinion, the adoption trend will follow unabated. In addition, we\nshould see a greater demand in the ability of CDE providers to enhance\nsecurity controls while making sure they don\u2019t have any negative impact on\ndeveloper productivity. Finally, developing CDE properties as a way to enhance\nthe three ways of DevOps is a great framework to drive innovation in a\nmeaningful way for the development community.\n\nLaurent is the co-founder and CEO of Strong Network, a Swiss start-up with a\nunique approach to securing cloud-based application development and a DevOps\nplatform recognized by Technology Analysts Gartner.
