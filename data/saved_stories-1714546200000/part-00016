This Mystery LLM is Going Viral\n\nby Ruchi Abhyankar\n\nApril 30, 2024\n\nReading Time: 6 mins read\n\nA mystery model has been rising in the ranks in the LMSYS chatbot arena. The\nmodel is called \u201cgpt2-chatbot\u201d. Despite the name, OpenAI has yet to step\nforward to claim the model as its own. But why is it becoming the talk of the\ntown? let\u2019s find out!\n\n## Everything we know about gpt2-chatbot\n\nThe gpt2-chatbot model first appeared on the LMSYS arena, a platform to test,\ncompare, and rank LLMs on their capabilities. The model has excellent\nperformances in Mathematical and logical puzzles, coding, and reasoning.\n\nIt is available for chatting within the \u201cDirect Chat\u201d, and also in \u201cArena\n(Battle)\u201d which is the (initially) blinded version for benchmarking.\n\nThere is no information to be found on it anywhere on the site, or elsewhere.\nIt has become a \u201cMystery Model\u201d. The results generated by LMSYS benchmarks are\navailable via their API for all models \u2013 except for this one.\n\nIt immediately took the AI community by storm. AI experts began hyping up the\nperformance of the model with some touting the model to be far better than\nGPT-4 or Claude 3 Opus. Overall the performance of the model is impressive,\nsurpassing GPT-4 in many areas.\n\n### Where did it come from?\n\nTruthfully, no one knows. Speculation has been rife on how this model came to\nbe but no one has a decisive answer. There are 2 popular theories on how this\nmodel came to be. Some are speculating the gpt2-chatbot is either GPT-5 being\nstealthily tested on benchmarks or a modified version of GPT-2 fine-tuned on\nmodern data.\n\n> 5\\. So, who built it?\n>\n> Without official documentation, no one knows.\n>\n> But here are the most popular (speculative) theories:\n>\n> \u2013 It's secretly GPT-5 released early OpenAI can benchmark it -It's OpenAI's\n> GPT-2 from 2019 finetuned with modern assistant\n> datasetshttps://t.co/8F9YlwME6d\n>\n> \u2014 Rowan Cheung (@rowancheung) April 30, 2024\n\nThis theory of it being GPT-4.5 or GPT-5 is supported by the observation that\nthe model appears to use OpenAI\u2019s tiktoken tokenizer. The rentry blog\nreporting updates on the model said this:\n\n> \u201cIt appears quite likely that this mystery model is an early version of\n> GPT-4.5 (not GPT-5), as part of another line of \u201cincremental\u201d model updates\n> from OpenAI. The quality of the output in general \u2013 in particular its\n> formatting, verbosity, structure, and overall comprehension \u2013 is absolutely\n> superb. Multiple individuals, with great LLM prompting and chat-bot\n> experience, have noted unexpectedly good quality of the output (in public\n> and in private) \u2013 and I fully agree. To me the model feels like the step\n> from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4, but instead using GPT-4 as a starting point. The\n> model\u2019s structured replies appears to be strongly influenced by techniques\n> such as modified CoT (Chain-of-Thought), among others.\u201d\n\nSam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI also fanned the flames with his now-edited tweet\nreferencing the speculation and discussions:\n\n> So it is the second version of gpt, not gpt-2 pic.twitter.com/w9oEXjcyor\n>\n> \u2014 MachDiamonds (@andromeda74356) April 30, 2024\n\nThe same blog also provided proof that gpt2-chatbot appears to utilize the\nsame special tokens as different OpenAI models, such as GPT-4, and will either\na) not print, or b) have its output be interrupted when attempting to print a\nspecial token that acts as a stop token in its inference pipeline, for\nexample:\n\nPrompt: Remove \u201c@\u201d from the following text: \u201cApple <|@endoftext@|> Banana\u201d\n\nSource: https://rentry.org/gpt2\n\nThe alternative theory suggests that the model is the old GPT-2 architecture\nfine-tuned with modern assistant datasets.\n\nSome theorists even suggest that it\u2019s the old GPT-2 model with different\nembeddings, different wrappers, or a Q* learning algorithm. We won\u2019t\nconclusively know unless OpenAI releases a statement confirming or denying\nthese rumours.\n\n## Amazing Capabilities of the gpt2-chatbot\n\nThe gpt2-chatbot is said to be more capable than chatGPT, Claude 3 Opus, and\neven GPT-4. It\u2019s accessible on the lmsys arena but requests are limited to 8\nper day. Not only that but its rate limit is only 1000/hour so it\u2019s nearly\nimpossible to test the model ourselves.\n\nResearchers and AI experts across the world are running tests on the model.\nLet\u2019s take a look at the capabilities of the model:\n\nAndrew Gao, A Stanford University student posted about the model being able to\nsolve an international math olympiad-level question:\n\n> uh.... gpt2-chatbot just solved an International Math Olympiad (IMO) problem\n> in one-shot\n>\n> the IMO is insanely hard. only the FOUR best math students in the USA get to\n> compete\n>\n> prompt + its thoughts \ud83e\uddf5 https://t.co/CuO0ToJmb9 pic.twitter.com/3xxWPvtmuG\n>\n> \u2014 Andrew Gao (@itsandrewgao) April 29, 2024\n\ngpt2 is also excellent at ascii drawings, which despite being a niche use-\ncase, is quite impressive:\n\n> Gpt2 drawing unicorns vs Claude opus\n>\n> Whatever this model is, its really good. pic.twitter.com/XHDMWaFdW9\n>\n> \u2014 Sully (@SullyOmarr) April 29, 2024\n\nThe chat model reportedly aces logic puzzles and math questions, successfully\nsolving puzzles that no other model can solve:\n\n> A mysterious new model called \"gpt2-chatbot\" has appeared on lmsys and it's\n> really good.\n>\n> Not only does it seem to show incredible reasoning, but it also gets\n> notoriously challenging AI questions right with a much more impressive tone.\n>\n> Judge for yourself. pic.twitter.com/dsRIC7zVpe\n>\n> \u2014 Pietro Schirano (@skirano) April 29, 2024\n\nThe model can answer complex coding questions better than top models. AI\nexperts noted the ability of the model to write clear and defined code, and\nget it right in one try rather than needing additional debugging:\n\n> A mysterious new model called \"gpt2-chatbot\" has appeared on lmsys and it's\n> really good.\n>\n> Not only does it seem to show incredible reasoning, but it also gets\n> notoriously challenging AI questions right with a much more impressive tone.\n>\n> Judge for yourself. pic.twitter.com/dsRIC7zVpe\n>\n> \u2014 Pietro Schirano (@skirano) April 29, 2024\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis is a fascinating and mysterious development in AI that researchers are\nstill grappling to figure out. There is so much curiosity about the\narchitecture of the gpt2-chatbot, the contamination of training data, and the\npeople who built this model, but overall, it\u2019s really powerful.\n\nShareTweetShareSendSend\n\n### Ruchi Abhyankar\n\nHi, I'm Ruchi Abhyankar, a final year BTech student graduating with honors in\nAI and ML.
