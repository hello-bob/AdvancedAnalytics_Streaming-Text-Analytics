The Opinion addresses the validity of consent to\nprocess personal data for the purposes of behavioural advertising in the\ncontext of \u2018consent or pay\u2019 models deployed by large online platforms.\n\n> EDPB Chair Anu Talus said: \u201cOnline platforms should give users a real choice\n> when employing \u2018consent or pay\u2019 models. The models we have today usually\n> require individuals to either give away all their data or to pay. As a\n> result most users consent to the processing in order to use a service, and\n> they do not understand the full implications of their choices.\u201d\n\nAs regards \u2018consent or pay\u2019 models implemented by large online platforms, the\nEDPB considers that, in most cases, it will not be possible for them to comply\nwith the requirements for valid consent, if they confront users only with a\nchoice between consenting to processing of personal data for behavioural\nadvertising purposes and paying a fee.\n\nThe EDPB considers that offering only a paid alternative to services which\ninvolve the processing of personal data for behavioural advertising purposes\nshould not be the default way forward for controllers. When developing\nalternatives, large online platforms should consider providing individuals\nwith an \u2018equivalent alternative\u2019 that does not entail the payment of a fee. If\ncontrollers do opt to charge a fee for access to the \u2018equivalent alternative\u2019,\nthey should give significant consideration to offering an additional\nalternative. This free alternative should be without behavioural advertising,\ne.g. with a form of advertising involving the processing of less or no\npersonal data. This is a particularly important factor in the assessment of\nvalid consent under the GDPR.\n\nThe EDPB stresses that obtaining consent does not absolve the controller from\nadhering to all the principles outlined in Art. 5 GDPR, such as purpose\nlimitation, data minimisation and fairness. In addition, large online\nplatforms should also consider compliance with the principles of necessity and\nproportionality, and they are responsible for demonstrating that their\nprocessing is generally in line with the GDPR.\n\nAs regards the need for consent to be free, the following criteria should be\ntaken into account: conditionality, detriment, imbalance of power and\ngranularity. For instance, the EDPB points out that any fee charged cannot\nmake individuals feel compelled to consent. Controllers should assess, on a\ncase-by-case basis, both whether a fee is appropriate at all and what amount\nis appropriate in the given circumstances. Large online platforms should also\nconsider whether the decision not to consent may lead the individual to suffer\nnegative consequences, such as exclusion from a prominent service, lack of\naccess to professional networks, or risk of losing content or connections. The\nEDPB notes that negative consequences are likely to occur when large online\nplatforms use a \u2018consent or pay\u2019 model to obtain consent for the processing.\n\nControllers also need to evaluate, on a case-by-case basis, whether there is\nan imbalance of power between the individual and the controller. The factors\nto be assessed include the position of the large online platforms in the\nmarket, the extent to which the individual relies on the service and the main\naudience of the service.\n\nFurthermore, the EDPB provides elements to assess the criteria of informed,\nspecific and unambiguous consent that large online platforms should take into\naccount when implementing \u2018consent or pay\u2019 models.\n\n> EDPB Chair, Anu Talus added: \u201cControllers should take care at all times to\n> avoid transforming the fundamental right to data protection into a feature\n> that individuals have to pay to enjoy. Individuals should be made fully\n> aware of the value and the consequences of their choices.\u201d\n\nIn addition to this Art. 64(2) Opinion, the EDPB will also develop guidelines\non \u2018consent or pay\u2019 models with a broader scope and will engage with\nstakeholders on these upcoming guidelines.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The EDPB was asked to issue this opinion under Art. 64(2) GDPR\nto address the validity of consent in the context of \u2018consent or pay\u2019 models\ndeployed by large online platforms, when consent is sought to process personal\ndata for the purposes of behavioural advertising, also in view of the Court of\nJustice of the European Union\u2019s Bundeskartellamt judgment (C-252/21).\n\nTopics:\n\n  * Consistency\n  * Controller\n  * Legal basis\n  * Consent\n  * GDPR\n\n## Latest news\n\n#### EDPB sets out priorities for 2024-2027 and clarifies implementation DPF\nredress mechanisms\n\n18 April 2024\n\nMember states:\n\n    * EDPB\n\n#### EDPB: \u2018Consent or Pay\u2019 models should offer real choice\n\n17 April 2024\n\nMember states:\n\n    * EDPB\n\n#### Ministry of Migration and Asylum receives administrative fine and GDPR\ncompliance order following an own-initiative investigation by the Greek SA\n\n15 April 2024\n\nMember states:\n\n    * Greece\n\n#### Commercial prospecting: French SA fined HUBSIDE.STORE \u20ac525,000\n\n15 April 2024\n\nMember states:\n\n    * France\n    * Belgium\n    * Italy\n    * Portugal\n    * Spain\n\n#### CSC elects 2nd Deputy Coordinator\n\n10 April 2024\n\nMember states:\n\n    * EDPB\n\n### We use cookies\n\nWhen you visit our website, if you give your consent, we will use cookies to\nallow us to collect data for aggregated statistics to improve our services and\nremember your choice for future visits.
