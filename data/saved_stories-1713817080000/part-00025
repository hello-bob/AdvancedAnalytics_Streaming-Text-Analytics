We\ninvestigate any reports of such conduct and take appropriate action against\nanyone found to have violated our policies.\"\n\nAs well as alleging sexism and discrimination against her, Ghaderi also\naccuses the tech giant of singling her out because she complained when Amazon\nallegedly breached its own rules against copyright infringement when it came\nto AI research.\n\nAccording to Ghaderi's account in the complaint, she returned to work after\ngiving birth in January 2023, inheriting a large language model project. Part\nof her role was flagging violations of Amazon's internal copyright policies\nand escalating these concerns to the in-house legal team. In March 2023, the\nfiling claims, her team director, Andrey Styskin, challenged Ghaderi to\nunderstand why Amazon was not meeting its goals on Alexa search quality.\n\nThe filing alleges she met with a representative from the legal department to\nexplain her concerns and the tension they posed with the \"direction she had\nreceived from upper management, which advised her to violate the direction\nfrom legal.\"\n\nAccording to the complaint, Styskin rejected Ghaderi's concerns, allegedly\ntelling her to ignore copyright policies to improve the results. Referring to\nrival AI companies, the filing alleges he said: \"Everyone else is doing it.\"\n\nThe allegations come at a difficult time for developers of AI models in\nrelation to copyright infringement in training data. A string of legal cases\nhave been launched concerning the consumption and reproduction of copyrighted\ntext by generative AI. Novelists Paul Tremblay, Christopher Golden, Richard\nKadrey, and comedian Sarah Silverman accused OpenAI of unlawfully scraping\ntheir work last year, while the New York Times is suing Microsoft and OpenAI,\nclaiming the duo infringed on the newspaper's copyright by using its articles\nwithout permission.\n\nA German-born doctor of electrical engineering, Ghaderi also made a series of\nallegations relating to her treatment by Amazon following the disclosure of\nher pregnancy.\n\nAccording to the complaint, she joined the technology giant as a program\nmanager in 2018 and received glowing appraisals. Although she left to join a\nstartup in February 2021, Ghaderi was rehired by Amazon \"based on her strong\nperformance and relationships with colleagues.\"\n\nGhaderi was offered a new role with the opportunity to become an applied\nscience manager. She rejoined as a engineering manager at the top of a salary\nband, leading a team of one scientist and two engineers. For the first five\nmonths of her return she received positive feedback from supervisors and\ndirect reports, her filing claims.\n\nIn September 2022, Amazon put together a new science team looking at data\nquality and compliance in the Alexa organization. Ghaderi says in her\ncomplaint that she moved up a level of management to lead the team, and\nreported to the department director Daniel Marcu, on a higher grade than her\nprevious manager.\n\nOn her first meeting with Marcu, she disclosed she was pregnant, information\nshe had already shared with her previous manager. \"Marcu, taken aback,\nresponded by informing Ghaderi that she would be 'temporarily' transferred to\nreport to a different employee, Mahesh Krishnakumar. Marcu admitted to Ghaderi\nthat he was changing her reporting structure 'temporar[ily]' so he would not\nhave to 'worry' about managing her team during her leave,\" the court documents\nallege.\n\nGhaderi claims Krishnakumar later pressured her into delaying the start of her\nmaternity leave from the planned date of November 7. Agreeing to the request,\nshe worked until November 15, 2022, \"the day she was forced to undergo an\nemergency C-section,\" according to the filing.\n\nTwo weeks later, the launch of OpenAI's GPT-4 caused \"panic\" within Amazon,\nthe complaint adds.\n\nGhaderi is also alleging a retaliation charge against Amazon \"based on her\ncomplaints of violations of copyright law and policy\" as well as on the basis\nof alleged violations of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act.\n\nAfter she returned to work in January 2023, Ghaderi claims she was told by\ncolleagues that Krishnakumar had not been present for most of her absence, and\nwhen he was there he contributed little, resulting in a backlog of work. While\nmanaging Ghaderi, the documents allege Krishnakumar made \"numerous\ndiscriminatory and harassing comments\" such as \"Take it easy, I have young\ndaughters, so I know it's hard to be a woman with a newborn,\" or \"You should\nspend time with your daughter,\" or \"You should just enjoy being a new mother.\"\n\nGhaderi made repeated requests to be reinstated to her promised career path,\naccording to the complaint, which goes on to allege that Marcu denied this\nrequest and said she should continue reporting to Krishnakumar. After Styskin\njoined the organization as a director, Ghaderi's complaint claims, Marcu said\nthe decision was now his and she was never reinstated.\n\nShe goes on to allege that in a performance review, Amazon did not consider\nevidence from before her maternity leave. While she met the \"high bar\"\nexpected by the company she needed to improve on \"earning trust\" and\n\"delivering results,\" the review said. When she asked Krishnakumar for\nevidence to support this claim, he could not provide any, according to the\ncomplaint.\n\nIn March 2023, she complained to HR about the review, and the failure to\nreinstate her in the role she had been promised. After a meeting with Styskin\nand Krishnakumar, she again complained to HR that the \"work context/dynamic\nha[d] completely shifted from just 4.5 months ago when I had been moved... to\nwork under [Marcu] before my maternity leave.\"\n\nShortly after the HR meeting, the complaint alleges Styskin told the AI exec\nshe would be stripped of her team and demoted. He then asked her how she felt\nabout the decision. When she asked for clarification, he allegedly responded:\n\"You know, feelings, or are you saying, 'Oh, I'm from Germany so I don't have\nfeelings'?\"\n\nGhaderi then made a formal complaint to HR, alleging her demotion related to\ndiscrimination and retaliation relating to her pregnancy. The filing alleges\nshe also mentioned Styskin's comment about her not having feelings owing to\nher nationality. Although HR did find the latter remark had fallen below\nAmazon's standards of conduct, it did not uphold the two other complaints.\n\nIn May 2023, Ghaderi took more protected leave, to return in August 2023,\nafter which she was placed on Amazon's informal \"Focus\" performance review\nplan and her role was diminished again. The complaint claims she was then\ngiven another negative performance appraisal and told the career path\navailable to her prior to her maternity leave was no longer on the table.\n\n  * US Equal Employment agency says Workday AI hiring bias case should continue\n  * SAP accused of age discrimination, retaliation by US whistleblower\n  * Ex-IBM staff ask US Supremes for help in bringing age-discrimination battle to court\n  * Three quarters of software engineers face retaliation for whistleblowing\n\nThe filing continues that she subsequently requested to be moved to another\nteam, but, allegedly, her line manager said because she was on the Focus plan\nshe was ineligible for a transfer. After that, she was placed on the formal\n\"Pivot\" plan, which means leaving or complying with performance targets.\n\nThe complaint argues the plan was designed to ensure Ghaderi's failure.\n\nFor example, the first goal required her to create a plan to reduce data\nstorage costs across the entire AmazonBot web crawling organization by 75\npercent in just eight workdays.\n\nMs. Ghaderi asked several senior, high-performing engineers about this goal,\nand they confirmed that they did not believe it was possible within the given\ntimeframe. Even if it were possible, Ms. Ghaderi had not been responsible for\ndata storage until the week she was placed on the Pivot plan, meaning that she\nhad no time to understand the existing storage architecture.\n\nThe filing adds that after she requested guidance on the task she was told she\n\"should be able to do this with no help.\"\n\nGhaderi complained again to HR about pregnancy discrimination and being given\nimpossible performance tasks, after which she alleges she was fired.\n\nHer lawyers have demanded a jury trial and named Amazon.com Services, Andrey\nStyskin, and Mahesh Krishnakumar as defendants. They also cite other unnamed\ndefendants. The lawsuit includes seven causes including violation of\nemployment law against sex discrimination, pregnancy leave law, harassment,\nprotection against retaliation. It also includes failure to take steps to\nprevent discrimination and protect whistleblowers, as well as wrongful\ntermination of employment.\n\nA case management conference has been set [PDF] for August 14. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Amazon\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Amazon\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AWS\n  * Ebook\n  * Kindle\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Jeff Bezos\n\n#### More about\n\n5 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Amazon\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Amazon\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AWS\n  * Ebook\n  * Kindle\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Jeff Bezos\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Amazon search results now less self-centered, boffin says\n\nSelf-preferencing pushback in Europe and US seems to have had some effect\n\nNetworks10 days | 8\n\n#### GenAI will be bigger than the cloud or the internet, Amazon CEO hopes\n\nAnd Andy Jassy will happily take your money along the way\n\nOff-Prem11 days | 15\n\n#### Snowmobile, Amazon's truck-powered migration service, reaches the end of\nthe road\n\nDemand for bulk storage on wheels turned out to be wan\n\nStorage5 days | 12\n\n#### A different view from the edge\n\nHow Dell NativeEdge provides the single pane of glass which harmonizes your IT\nand OT perspective\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Irish power crunch could be prompting AWS to ration compute resources\n\nExclusive Users report being pointed to other EU regions if they need more\ngrunt\n\nOn-Prem13 days | 113\n\n#### Amazon to lure upstarts with $500K in AWS AI credits each\n\nCome on in, drill into Anthropic and Mistral \u2013 that's not the sound of a door\nslamming shut behind you\n\nAI + ML20 days | 1\n\n#### AWS severs connection with several hundred staff\n\n'Necessary,' 'focusing our efforts,' 'deliver maximum impact' ... sounds just\nlike all the other tech layoffs lately\n\nPaaS + IaaS19 days | 13\n\n#### Amazon fined in Europe for screwing shoppers with underhand dark patterns\n\nE-commerce titan to appeal sanction amounting to three hours of annual profit\n\nPersonal Tech24 days | 54\n\n#### Amazon finishes pumping $4B into AI darling Anthropic\n\nAdds $2.75B to the ML sweepstakes ante and is counting on Claude\n\nAI + ML26 days | 3\n\n#### Garlic chicken without garlic?
