Where researchers tried to figure out how it worked\nand who did what, as well as resolving mythologies uncovered in the process.\nIt made for fascinating reading and I loved how everything came to light over\na period of time.\n\nInitial physical prototype version of Amaze that was built by Paul in 1981.\n\nRather than re-tell the entire story which is covered elsewhere in great\ndetail, we are sharing links to the various papers, podcasts, and pages that\nhave been published in chronological order, so you can see and read through\nthe journey which would eventually lead to the original prototype code being\nmade available. If anything else comes to light which is new information, we\nwill add it here.\n\nFirst of all \u2013 back in 2018, an academic paper was published by Aycock and\nCopplestone, which would carry out an archaeological examination\n(archaeogaming) of an Atari 2600 game called Entombed, containing an endless\nmaze algorithm which had staggered the researchers:\n\nClick to access 1811.02035.pdf\n\nThis generated some pretty impressive feedback, which included this BBC\narticle in 2019: https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190919-the-maze-puzzle-\nhidden-within-an-early-video-game\n\nAt this time, no-one knew how it all fully worked and came to be, not even who\nwas behind it all. One of those involved with Entombed, Steve Sidley, claimed\nthat the algorithm was the work of a programmer who had developed it \u201cwhilst\nnot entirely sober\u201d.\n\nThen followed a New Yorker Radio Hour Podcast, where talking with Steve \u2013 he\nrevealed that the person behind the algorithm may have had the surname\n\u201cNewell\u201d. This would lead the group to Paul Allen Newell and his 2008\ninterview for Digitpress where Paul revealed he worked on the Entombed maze\ngeneration algorithm. Eventually getting hold of Paul, they talked to him\nabout the algorithm in more detail, and later put together a podcast of the\nhistory/mythology:\n\nhttps://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/tnyradiohour/segments/unearthing-entombed\n\nThe algorithm had been generated originally for Towering Inferno. He and a\nfriend named Duncan Muirhead got together to create it, with Duncan doing the\nmaths and Paul the code. As well as Towering Inferno, Paul would later would\ndo a Vectrex adaption of Scramble, whilst Duncan did Armor Attack on the same\nplatform. Both would eventually go to Simutrek to do the arcade game Cube\nQuest.\n\nAs you will learn from the above link \u2013 the algorithm wasn\u2019t something that\nwas done whilst being \u201cout of it\u201d/drunk. This had been a cover to try and\nprotect the intellectual property of how the algorithm worked \u2013 it was\nprovided \u201cas is\u201d to be the seed for Entombed without explanation of the\ninternals and maths.\n\nPaul still had all the source code that he had created, which was then scanned\nin. Afterwards, a follow up paper was then created with all the new\ninformation that had now come to light, authored by Newell, Aycock, and\nBiittner: https://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue59/3/index.html\n\nThe article would go into detail of how it all worked thanks to Paul\u2019s new\ninformation, but also with source code too. The original 1981-82 rules for the\nprototype game are there as well. In the end, the algorithm would be called\n\u201cThe Muirhead-Newell Algorithm\u201d on the recommendation of Paul, as Duncan\u2019s\nmath was 51% of what was created, with the code \u201conly being\u201d 49%.\n\nFrom this, some of the code prototypes that Paul had produced before the\nalgorithm was used in Entombed were built and added to the Atari Protos\nwebsite with details about each. Here is a page on Entombed, along with links\nat the very bottom to some of these prototypes:\n\nhttps://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/entombed/entombed.htm\n\nFor our piece on this Games That Weren\u2019t site, Paul has kindly dug out a new\nimage showing the first physical version of Amaze \u2013 an initial version of the\n\u201c42 variations\u201d that was completed in October of 1981.\n\n\u201cIt was from this version that I and others determined that the best game\npossibility was a \u2018cat-and-mouse\u2019 with one player controlling the vertical\nscrolling of the maze and only able to move horizontally while the other\nplayer had full movement over the maze but at the whim of the first players\u2019s\nmaze scrolling.\u201d explained Paul. \u201cI knew it would need a lot of refinement but\nthought this was the best shot given the limited amount of space in the 4K\ncartridge for any more code. The attached image is the housing for that first\nversion which, yes, I still have. Who knows if the cartridge still works ...\nbut it is academic as there was a copy of code on floppy in my archives which\nI was able to recover.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Paul revealed that after doing the second paper with John Aycock\nand Katie Biittner, there arose a question of \u201cis it really endless and is it\nreally guaranteed to always provide a path\u201d. It had been very difficult to\ntell using an Atari 2600 and only slightly better with the emulator they had\nused (Stella).\n\nPaul therefore wrote a Linux version in C++ using the original OpenGL for the\ngraphics. \u201cThis gave me the ability to easily change variables and, most\nimportant, no 4K limit and no vertical blanking limit. I was able to determine\nthat the original algorithm was close but not perfect.\u201d explained Paul. \u201cSo I\ntweaked the algorithm and was able to get a better result. I was unable to\nprove success in an algorithmic fashion but was able to write a program that\ncould analysis the results of a long run of the code.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill not convinced I really had it, I upped the resolution. In Entombed, you\nhave 8 blocks wide which is then mirrored to get 16 (a block being a cell of\neither wall or passage). In my original algorithm, I had 16 blocks wide with\nno mirroring. In my Linux C++ version, I kicked it up to 32 blocks. This let\nme see details that were hidden with 16 blocks.\u201d continued Paul.\n\n\u201cIncluding the fact theorized by a reader of the first paper (Iikka Keranen)\nthat the algorithm had a tendency to push the occupant in the maze to the left\nowing to how it created new rows. I was able to correct that and now have what\nI think is a maze that actually is endless, always passable with serious\ndifficulty when trying to be a player in a cat-and-mouse game, and all\nalgorithmically generated.\u201d\n\nHere is a short clip of the Linux / OpenGL / 32\u00d732 version that Paul refers\nto:\n\nVideo Player\n\n00:00\n\n00:00\n\n00:33\n\nUse Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.\n\n\u2013\n\nIt is a wonderful story, and with a series of early prototypes of the\nalgorithm that Duncan and Paul had created \u2013 and carefully protected. Thanks\nto Paul Allen Newell for sharing and for additional details.\n\nThis entry was posted in: Atari 2600 / Atari VCS, Features, Prototype and\ntagged: No download available.
