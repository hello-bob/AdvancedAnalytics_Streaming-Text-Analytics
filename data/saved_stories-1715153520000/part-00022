Last year also saw GNOME Foundation naming a new executive\ndirector that will also help in their fundraising effort.\n\nAs for the 2023 finances of the GNOME Foundation, they are reporting $556,136\nUSD in income -- well up from the $363,380 reported in 2022... Much of that\nincrease is from fundraising in 2023 that generated $422k compared to $171k\nthe year prior.\n\nBut on the expenses side, in 2023 the foundation spent $675,947 USD -- $283k\non conferences, $105k on support and infrastructure, $96k on outreach, $121k\non administrative, etc. So the GNOME Foundation in 2023 ended up spending\nnearly $120k more than it took in for the year. That's better than in 2022\nwhen it spent $286k more than it took in that year.\n\nThis year the foundation is hoping to improve their financial position with\ngreater fundraising and cutting back on expenses.
