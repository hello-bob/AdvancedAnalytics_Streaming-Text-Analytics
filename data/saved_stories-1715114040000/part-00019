It could sound ridiculous and a bit funny,\nright? Are you reading it back? How can a few outperform the majority? And we\nhaven't even started on its formula of square root law. For the record, let's\nbase everything on equal terms.\n\nForemost we should understand that productivity and output are not linearly\ntied to the number of people involved in any task. Just because more people\nare working on something does not mean it will produce more results. In fact,\nwe all have heard many times, \"Too many cooks spoil the food\".\n\nLet's read about an interesting law named \"Price's Law\" that tries to explain\nthis predictive analogy. Price's Law says that \"the square root of the number\nof people in a domain do 50% of the work\". This often explains the skewed\ndistribution of productivity or success, where a small number of individuals\nor teams are responsible for a significant portion of the overall result.\nHaving said all, it's also very important to understand that Price's Law is\nbased on experiments and statistical analysis; it's a principle not a fact. It\ncan really differ from the reality.\n\n> If 10 people are working, then roughly 3 of them will produce half of the\n> total output and the remaining 7 will produce the other half. Now with 100\n> people working, it would be 10 people that does half of the work and other\n> 90 people doing the other half. Raise it to 10,000 people and you have 9,900\n> people doing only half of the work.\n\nThe best 100 people in the cohort of 10,000 who end up doing half of the work\noften possess certain qualities and skills that set them apart from the other\n9900. So as the team grows, competence grows linearly but incompetence grows\nexponentially.^[1]\n\nImagine you're in a bustling city filled with 100 passionate people, each\ndedicated to their own craft or profession; authors, designers, producers,\nathletes, or software developers, there's a whole spectrum of talent around\nyou. Despite the crowd, it's not evenly spread when it comes to productivity.\nIn fact, you'd find that roughly 10 of these individuals are hyperproductive.\nThe most copies of books sold, the most number of record labels produced, the\nmost number of compositions written, and the most number of goals scored and\non and on.\n\nIt's like a secret formula hidden in plain sight. The pattern of Price's Law;\na small fraction of the people tend to make a disproportionately large impact\nregularly.\n\nWe could ponder all day on this weird law and how this even happens. A more\nformidable answer could be a blend of talent, dedication, and opportunity.\nSome of us could argue that some are just built differently or have that\nspark, that innate ability to push boundaries and break new ground. They're\nthe ones burning the midnight oil, tinkering away at their craft while the\nrest of us catch up on the sofa with our games and binge-watch.\n\nIt's not just always about individual brilliance though, most of the time our\nactions also depend on the ecosystem we inhabit or the circle of friends we\nsurround ourselves with. The kind of environment that we nurture and amplify\nour talent provides us with the support and resources that we need to thrive\nahead.\n\nSo, the next time you're grinding at your beloved piece of craft however\nmenial that could seem to the world outside, always keep it groundbreaking to\nyour heart. And never forget your peers. Behind every great achievement,\nthere's always a small group of individuals quietly reshaping a team, a city,\na society and the world and that's what makes our journey through these realms\nof creativity and innovation so fascinating. Fascination keeps these square\nroot people attached to an obsession of doing half of the work. Half of the\nwork is just work for them. Because they are fascinated to do things when\nothers are merely obsessed.\n\nOur hunger to always do something is a reminder of the power of the human\nspirit, to defy the odds, to churn out big, and to leave an indelible mark.\nAnd who knows? Among those 100 people from the beginning, you are on the path\nto becoming the future trailblazer in the making, ready to take the world by\nstorm with your discipline and perseverance. Create, explore, expand and outdo\neveryone. Stop distinguishing between day and night. And good night because\nsleep is also important and writing is just fun.\n\n^[1] Jordan Peterson on Price's Law\n\n#### Sparsh\n\nSoftware Engineer\n\nverbose tethics \u00a9 2024\n\n# blog.sparsh.dev asks for your consent to use your personal data to:\n\n  * perm_identity\n\nPersonalised advertising and content, advertising and content measurement,\naudience research and services development\n\n  * devices\n\nStore and/or access information on a device\n\n  * How can I change my choice?\n\n  * What if I don't consent?\n\n  * How does legitimate interest work?\n\n  * Do I have to consent to everything?\n\nYour personal data will be processed and information from your device\n(cookies, unique identifiers, and other device data) may be stored by,\naccessed by and shared with 136 TCF vendor(s) and 62 ad partner(s), or used\nspecifically by this site or app.\n\nSome vendors may process your personal data on the basis of legitimate\ninterest, which you can object to by managing your options below.
