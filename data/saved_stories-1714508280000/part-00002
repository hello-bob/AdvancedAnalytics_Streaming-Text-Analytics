Although I\u2019m the English-speaker 99\npercent of the time, I have indeed been making an effort to learn Farsi. As a\nhistorian, I find it an especially fun language because there are so many\nhints of past events embedded in the vocabulary itself.\n\nA favorite example: there is a century-old debate among historical linguists\nthat hinges on the Farsi word div, which describes a type of demon from\nPersian mythology (you can see two examples below). Farsi is an Indo-European\nlanguage, and div is easily traceable back to an ancient Indo-European word\nfor gods or divinities. The original word, used by proto-Indo-European\nspeakers who lived around 5000 BCE, sounded something like deyw\u00f3s and likely\nreferred to a sun god. Today, it\u2019s the origin of Spanish dios, Latvian\ndaievas, English deity, and Hindi deva, all of which mean \u201cgod.\u201d\n\nAli Quli, Two Div Following the Order of King Solomon, detail of an\nillustration from a 16th century Mughal manuscript at the Walters Art Museum\n(Walters W.624)\n\nSo if all these words that are related to div mean \u201cgod\u201d... why does the Farsi\nword mean \u201cdemon\u201d?\n\nThe answer lies in the ancient sister-tongues of Avestan and Old Persian \u2014 the\nlanguages of the Iranian peoples circa 1000 to 500 BCE. Both of these\nlanguages feature the word daeva. The Wikipedia page for this term is a decent\nexplainer for what may be going on here (and here\u2019s a more scholarly article\nif you want to go into the weeds). It would appear that among ancient\nZoroastrians, the daeva, including gods like Indra, came to be regarded as an\nolder category of \u201cgods to be rejected\u201d in favor of Zoroastrian deities like\nAhura Mazda.\n\nOver centuries, the daeva were demoted from gods to demons. By the time of the\nimage above, which was made in the 16th century, the div had become something\nlike an evil djinn or the monsters of Greek legend. Meanwhile, the speakers of\nthe Indian branch of the Indo-Iranian languages (like Sanskrit and its\ndescendants) continued worshipping gods known collectively as deva.\n\nDid an ancient group of Indo-Iranian speakers, in their migrations south and\neast in the centuries before the Vedic period, undergo a social and religious\nschism? Did one branch condemn the old gods, while another (the proto-Vedic)\ncontinued to worship them?\n\nThe honest answer to this question is: no one knows for sure. But there is\nevidence that the switch to a negative perception of daeva among the ancient\nPersians really does map on to a historical event in the very distant past,\nperhaps around 1500 BCE.1\n\nThese sorts of parallels between closely-related Indo-Iranian languages are\none thing. But to a degree I find surprising, even Farsi and English \u2014 which\nare far more widely separated in the family tree of Indo-European languages \u2014\nhave some strikingly similar cognate words.\n\nHere are a few:\n\n> Abru = eyebrow\n>\n> Baradar = brother\n>\n> Dokhtar = daughter\n>\n> Garm = warm\n\nLikewise with Farsi and Spanish:\n\n> Dust (friend/liking) = Spanish gusto (taste/liking).\n\nI\u2019m emphasizing the Farsi cognates because it\u2019s a language I\u2019m currently\nlearning, but if you cast a wider net, you can find even more ancient shared\nwords. My favorite example: lox. Yes, the word for smoked salmon.\n\nThis word, amazingly, appears to have remained basically unchanged for about\nsix to eight thousand years. It is thought to derive from Proto-Indo-European\n*la\u1e31s- (\u201csalmon, trout\u201d). The same basic sound continued to mean the same\nthing in:\n\n  * Middle Dutch (lacks, lachs, lasche =\u201csalmon\u201d)\n\n  * German (lachs = \u201csalmon\u201d)\n\n  * Latvian (lasis = \u201csalmon\u201d)\n\n  * Russian (\u043b\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0301\u0441\u044c los\u00f3s = \u201csalmon\u201d)\n\nAs this article on the subject from Nautilus points out, \u201claks\u201d even means\n\u201cfish\u201d in Tocharian B!\n\n###\n\nWhy etymologies matter for historians\n\nCognates are useful not just for linguists, but for historians of religion,\nculture, and science and technology. They allow us to make guesses \u2014\ntentative, but still evidence-based \u2014 about stories and events from before the\nadvent of written records.\n\nOne example that has stuck with me since it was announced in 2016 is this\nphylogenetic study of fairytales conducted by the folklorist Sara Gra\u00e7a da\nSilva and the anthropologist Jamshid Tehrani.2 Da Silva and Tehrani reached\nthe conclusion that certain legends found in story collections like Grimm\u2019s\nfairy tales, Aesop\u2019s fables, and The Arabian Nights may date to around six to\nseven thousand years ago, in the era when proto-Indo-European was still a\nliving language. Among the very oldest stories they could trace back was the\ntale known as the Smith and the Devil: the origin for the later tale of Doctor\nFaustus. In it, a blacksmith \u2014 a figure associated with magic and the\nsupernatural across a remarkably wide cultural sphere, from Europe to sub-\nSaharan Africa \u2014 enters into a pact with a malign supernatural entity, usually\na devil. The Smith wins the power to forge any substance, then uses it to fix\nthe devil to a piece of heavy metal, allowing him to get out of his devil\u2019s\nbargain.\n\nA chart of different legends via da Silva and Tehrani, \u201cComparative\nphylogenetic analyses uncover the ancient roots of Indo-European folktales\u201d\n(2016). Number 330 is \u201cThe Smith and the Devil.\u201d Other legends that appear to\ndate back to the Bronze Age include #328, a version of Jack and the Beanstalk.\n\nIf true, this is one of the oldest documented human stories, predating the\nBible, the Odyssey, or the Vedic hymns. (As a side note, I find it interesting\nthat it\u2019s a story about technology).\n\nThere is something deeply appealing for me in finding these echoes across vast\ndistances and many thousands of years, connecting cultures that are usually\ndepicted in contemporary media as having little in common.\n\nAnd that, in fact, is why I wanted to write about etymology. The hunt for\nshared etymological origins doesn\u2019t just have an intellectual appeal. It\u2019s\nalso a reminder of the profound interconnectedness of human history. Including\nthe connections between languages and cultures \u2014 between, say, the English-\nspeaking world and the Persianate world \u2014 that contemporary media tends to\ndepict as two separate and even opposing spheres.\n\n###\n\nOh, hello...\n\nEtymology is not just a tool for uncovering ancient myths and cultural\nconnections. It can also reveal unfamiliar aspects of more recent history.\nTake the word hello, for instance. I like to remind my students that many\nwords that sound \u201cmodern\u201d tend to have longer histories than we might realize.\nFor instance, Shakespeare\u2019s characters call one another \u201ccuz,\u201d and the\nearliest use of \u201cbro\u201d as an abbreviation for \u201cbrother\u201d dates to the 16th\ncentury.\n\nBut \u201chello,\u201d it turns out, is strangely new. It first appeared in print in the\n1820s, and only became popular following the invention of the telephone.\n\nOn his old blog for NPR, Robert Krulwich gave an overview of the word\u2019s\nsurprisingly recent history. Drawing on the research of Ammon Shea, Krulwich\nwrites:\n\n> The Oxford English Dictionary says the first published use of \u201chello\u201d goes\n> back only to 1827. And it wasn't mainly a greeting back then. Ammon says\n> people in the 1830's said hello to attract attention (\u201cHello, what do you\n> think you're doing?\u201d), or to express surprise (\u201cHello, what have we here?\u201d).\n> Hello didn't become \u201chi\u201d until the telephone arrived.\n>\n> The dictionary says it was Thomas Edison who put hello into common usage. He\n> urged the people who used his phone to say \u201chello\u201d when answering. His\n> rival, Alexander Graham Bell, thought the better word was \u201cahoy.\u201d\n\nI did a bit of digging on Google Books and the Internet Archive, and can\nattest that \u201chello\u201d appears to have taken over the world alongside the\ntelephone. There\u2019s an explosion of uses in the 1880s and 1890s in newspaper\naccounts of the newfangled device.\n\nFor instance, this from 1893:\n\n\u201cHello ! Hello ! Is that you ?\u201d\n\nRepeated uses of \u201chello\u201d as a salutation on the phone appeared in an\nincredibly complex series of lawsuits filed by and against the Bell Telephone\nCompany in the 1880s. Some of the legal wrangling hinged on whether \u201chello\u201d\ncould actually be heard by someone on the other end of the line in a 1887\nexperiment:\n\nFrom around this time onwards, usage of \u201chello\u201d as a greeting takes off\nthroughout the English speaking world.\n\nWhy the sudden shift?\n\nThere\u2019s a hint in this 1877 letter from Thomas Edison to a telegraph\nexecutive:\n\n> I do not think we shall need a call bell as Hello! can be heard 10 to 20\n> feet away. What you think? Edison \u2013 P.S. first cost of sender & receiver to\n> manufacture is only $7.00. [source]\n\nBefore the telephone, there were several options for greetings \u2014 variations on\n\u201chow do you do,\u201d \u201cgood day,\u201d and the like. But as the text of that Bell\nTelephone lawsuit suggests, one of the biggest problems with early telephone\nlines was noise. Witness poor Leon O. McPherson, futilely shouting \u201cDo you\nunderstand any word that I say? Hello, hello, hello! Do you hear me? Jack and\nJill, and so forth!\u201d through a static-y telephone line, his efforts spoiled by\nthe noisy lead pencil of a stenographer.\n\nThe affordances of the technology itself pushed its users to settle on a\nsingle, clearly enunciated word: \u201chello!\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t necessarily a process that anyone at the time wrote about in a\nself-aware way. Like the shift in the meaning of daeva in the distant past, it\nwas one of those moments of change that happened without documentation, and\nwhich must have seemed entirely natural and even inevitable at the time. These\nmoments of unheralded change are what historians like me spend so much time\ntrying to unearth and understand.\n\nI love etymologies because they evoke the strange mixture of familiarity and\ndifference that makes history so compelling. They are ways of seeing around\nthe corners of the past into vanished worlds of thought.\n\nWe say \u201chello\u201d to them, and we always receive an answer we didn\u2019t quite\nexpect.\n\n##\n\nWeekly links\n\n\u2022 As someone with ties to both universities, my thoughts lately are with the\nColumbia and UT Austin students calling for a cease fire in the Israel-Gaza\nconflict. I was heartened to see friends and former colleagues like Columbia\nhistory professor Chris Brown and classics professor Joe Howley speak out\nagainst the clear threat to freedom of expression represented by the\ncompletely uncalled-for response from police and administrators.\n\n\u2022 The UK edition of my book Tripping on Utopia is out now, with a new cover\nand slightly different subtitle: \u201cMargaret Mead, the Cold War, and the Birth\nof Psychedelics.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cHow many bathrooms have Neanderthals in the tile?\u201d (Johnhawks.net)\n\n\u2022\n\nEthan Mollick\n\n\u2019s new book Co-Intelligence. This promises to be the most thoughtful work yet\non how generative AI can help augment, rather than replace, aspects of\nresearch and pedagogy (it also features a surprise Res Obscura cameo \u2014 my post\non history simulations using ChatGPT is discussed on pages 174-175).\n\n\u2022 For a much more extensive list of Farsi-English cognates: Hidden in Plain\nSight: Illuminating Indo-European Words in Persian.\n\n\u2022 And from Miller\u2019s Book Review, which is a great newsletter on books and the\nbook trade, a charming post on dedications and footnotes, including this\namazing example of the latter: \u201cThis was once revealed to me in a dream.\u201d\n\nIf you received this email, it means you signed up for the Res Obscura\nnewsletter, written by me, Benjamin Breen.
