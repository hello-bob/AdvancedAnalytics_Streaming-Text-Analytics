Some veterinarians and advocates warn that\nprivate equity\u2019s involvement in veterinary care could lead to higher costs for\nconsumers and the closure of independent practices. Wilfredo Lee/The\nAssociated Press\n\nHUNTSVILLE, Ala. \u2014 About a year ago, veterinarian Melissa Ezell started\nnoticing subtle changes at the midsized animal clinic in Huntsville, Alabama,\nwhere she works.\n\n#### Hollowed Out\n\nThis story is one in a series examining private equity\u2019s impact on health care\nand the ways that states are responding.\n\nJan. 18: Nearly 400 U.S. hospitals are owned by private equity investors,\nrepresenting 1 out of every 3 for-profit hospitals. When private equity takes\nover, hospitals sometimes see closures and cutbacks.\n\nJan. 31: Alabama\u2019s largest provider of home care services employed nearly 800\ncaregivers scattered across every county in the state, helping 1,100 older and\ndisabled clients. And then suddenly, it was gone.\n\nShe said she and other vets were feeling pressure from management to make a\ncertain amount of money from every appointment. If a pet owner wasn\u2019t going to\nspend enough, the message from management was to offer more services. She was\nurged to pack in more patients outside of normal business hours.\n\n\u201cBefore, I never felt any pressure to be making a certain amount of money in a\nday,\u201d Ezell, who started working at the clinic in 2021, told Stateline. \u201cIt\nwas just, \u2018Fill your schedule, practice good medicine, everything else will\ncome.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe clinic is owned by National Veterinary Associates, one of the largest\nveterinary chains in the nation. In 2020 the company was acquired by JAB\nConsumer Partners, a global private equity firm based in Luxembourg. By early\n2023, Ezell said, she felt a shift in atmosphere at the clinic and a greater\nfocus on increasing profits.\n\nPrivate equity\u2019s foray into the human health care industry in recent years has\ndrawn public outrage and legislative scrutiny as firms have been blamed for\nincreasing prices, slashing services and shuttering hospitals to maximize\nshareholder profits.\n\nNow, some veterinarians and advocates are sounding the alarm that private\nequity\u2019s entry into the pet health care industry could lead to similar\nresults.\n\nSome states already have laws that prohibit non-veterinarians from owning\nveterinary practices, and some consumer advocates want states to review large-\nscale acquisitions in the industry.\n\n\u201cA large number of these funds are seeing veterinary medicine as a good profit\ncenter,\u201d said Dr. Grant Jacobson, an Iowa veterinarian who serves on the board\nof the Independent Veterinary Practitioners Association. He said he\u2019s seen\ncorporate-owned chains in his region drive up prices for consumers, suppress\nmarket competition and skirt state laws that ostensibly prohibit veterinary\npractices from being owned by non-veterinarians.\n\nPrivate equity firms such as Shore Capital Partners, KKR, TSG Consumer and JAB\nConsumer Partners have spent billions over the past few years on veterinary\npractices, specialty animal hospitals, pet insurance services and pet food\ncompanies. Among the companies owned by private equity are PetSmart, PetVet\nCare Centers, FIGO, Thrive Pet Healthcare and ASPCA Pet Health Insurance.\n\nPrivate equity firms say those investments are giving clinics and other\nproviders the capital they need to buy better technology, and that they are\nimproving efficiency. And in many cases, corporate chains can offer their\nemployees better workplace benefits, such as health insurance.\n\nIn a statement to Stateline, National Veterinary Associates said its corporate\nphilosophy is \u201cgrounded in vets making medical decisions and not a corporate\noffice,\u201d and that its program of shared ownership by veterinarians is \u201cthe\nindustry\u2019s largest such program and unique among our peers.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur vision is to build a community of hospitals that pet owners trust, are\neasy to access, and provide the best possible care,\u201d National Veterinary\nAssociates said in the statement.\n\nJAB Consumer Partners did not respond to Stateline\u2019s request for comment.\n\n#### More pets, more money\n\nPrivate equity uses pooled investment money from pension funds, endowments and\nwealthy individuals to buy controlling stakes in companies. The firms\ntypically look for a quick return on their investment before selling it within\na few years. They have been gobbling up small businesses in myriad industries\nin recent years \u2014 from nursing homes to car washes.\n\n> \u2018Shell game\u2019: When private equity comes to town, hospitals can see cutbacks,\n> closures\n\nAs pet ownership soared during the COVID-19 pandemic, private equity followed\nclose behind. The pandemic years of 2020-2022 were \u201cthe peak years for private\nequity acquisitions of veterinary services and practices,\u201d said Michael Fenne,\nsenior coordinator for health care at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project,\na nonprofit watchdog group that advocates for communities affected by private\nequity ownership.\n\nAmericans spent a record $147 billion on pet products and services last year.\nFrom 2017 to 2022, private equity spent $45 billion on deals in the veterinary\nsector, according to PitchBook, which tracks investment data.\n\nThe vet industry is attractive because it\u2019s mostly made up of small, privately\nowned businesses that corporations can buy and consolidate into larger chains.\nAnd it\u2019s mainly a cash-based business: Unlike in human health care, veterinary\ncustomers typically pay out of pocket, rather than rely on third-party payers\nsuch as insurance companies.\n\nIn some cases, private equity firms and other corporations buy community\nclinics from the veterinarians who own them for two, five or even 10 times\ntheir value. Then the firms roll them up into a larger chain of clinics that\ncan corner a regional market.\n\nIt\u2019s a strategy that can push other private owners out of the business, said\nJacobson, the Iowa veterinarian. He spent nearly 20 years working at a\nprivately owned practice in Iowa and had hoped to buy it when the original\nfounder retired.\n\nBut the founder sold the practice to a large veterinary chain owned by Mars\nInc. \u2014 the private company best known for owning candy brands that include\nM&Ms \u2014 for more than $1 million above his offer, Jacobson said. Mars, while\nnot a private equity firm, is the biggest consolidator of pet care companies\nin the United States, owning pet food companies, pet pharmacies and veterinary\ncare clinic chains such as Banfield Pet Hospitals and BluePearl.\n\nYou feel like you don\u2019t have the time with the doctor, and you leave not fully\nunderstanding what was done to your pet or what is wrong with your pet if\nthey\u2019re sick.\n\n\u2013 Melissa Ezell, veterinarian\n\nAbout a quarter of general veterinary practices and about three-quarters of\nspecialty practices, such as emergency and surgery care, are now owned by\nlarge corporations, according to John Volk of Brakke Consulting, a veterinary\nmanagement consulting firm.\n\nSome private equity-backed chains, such as National Veterinary Associates, buy\ncommunity-based veterinary practices like Ezell\u2019s without rebranding them\nunder the chain\u2019s name. As a result, clients might not be aware of the\nownership change.\n\n\u201cIt can appear you\u2019re getting community-oriented care when there\u2019s actually\nthis set of big-box incentives underlying [the clinic] that comes from their\nprivate equity owners,\u201d Fenne said.\n\n#### Where vets want to work\n\nLori Kogan, a clinical sciences professor at Colorado State University\u2019s\nCollege of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, surveyed nearly 900\nveterinarians in 2022 about their experiences and perceptions of corporate vs.\nprivately owned veterinary clinics.\n\n> Private equity\u2019s growing footprint in home health care draws scrutiny\n\nEven though most of the veterinarians surveyed reported working for corporate-\nowned clinics, Kogan found more than half said they would prefer to work in\nprivately owned clinics. The benefits offered by corporate chains, such as\nhealth insurance, didn\u2019t seem strong enough to override other preferences,\nKogan told Stateline.\n\n\u201cFeeling like they have a voice in decision-making, feeling like they\u2019re\nrecognized as an individual, those are things that are really important to\npeople,\u201d she said. \u201cI think corporate ownership could accomplish those things,\nbut it will take paying attention.\u201d\n\nEzell, the veterinarian who left National Veterinary Associates, said the\npressure has an impact on patients and their humans as well.\n\n\u201cEither you\u2019re getting talked into additional services that may or may not\nactually be necessary, or your feel like you\u2019re being rushed,\u201d Ezell said.\n\u201cYou feel like you don\u2019t have the time with the doctor, and you leave not\nfully understanding what was done to your pet or what is wrong with your pet\nif they\u2019re sick.\u201d\n\nIn its statement to Stateline, National Veterinary Associates noted that it\nhas made \u201ccontinued investment in technology and infrastructure, pioneering\nclinical research, industry-leading continuing education programs and\nwellbeing initiatives.\u201d\n\n#### Could states step in?\n\nLast August, Thrive Pet Healthcare announced it would be closing the only\n24-hour emergency veterinary clinic in the Rochester, New York, metro area.\nThrive is a chain of more than 380 veterinary hospitals based in Austin,\nTexas, that is owned by private equity firm TSG Consumer.\n\n\u201cThe thought of having the only 24-hour emergency pet care center in our\nentire metro area close was really scary,\u201d said Rachel Barnhart, a Democratic\nmember of the Monroe County Legislature in New York who has taken her dogs to\nthe clinic. \u201cWe are a community of more than a million people. The idea that\nwe can\u2019t support a 24-hour pet facility is outrageous.\u201d\n\nBarnhart wrote a letter to the Federal Trade Commission, asking it to look\ninto Thrive, which operates more than a dozen clinics in Rochester. She said\nshe\u2019d seen the FTC act against anticompetitive practices in the veterinary\nindustry elsewhere, and she felt Thrive deserved similar scrutiny.\n\nThrive leadership said in a letter to Barnhart and in media reports that a\nshortage of ER veterinarians made it impossible to hire enough workers to keep\nthe 24-hour clinic open. But Barnhart suspected the company wanted to shutter\nthe clinic because its staff recently voted to unionize. CEO Tad Stahel said\nin the letter to Barnhart that the closure was unrelated to the staff\nunionization.\n\n> Should You Insure Your Pet? Without State Oversight, It\u2019s Hard to Say.\n\nIn 2022, the FTC took action against JAB Consumer Partners, which recently\nacquired an array of veterinary and pet service companies. The FTC required\nthe firm to divest some of its vet clinics in California, Colorado, Texas,\nVirginia and Washington, D.C., as a condition of approving its multibillion-\ndollar purchases of two other multistate veterinary care chains.\n\nIf states were to authorize officials or agencies to review similar large-\nscale mergers and acquisitions in the veterinary industry, that \u201cwould be a\ngood first step\u201d toward protecting consumers, said Fenne, of the advocacy\ngroup.\n\nMany states already have laws that prohibit non-veterinarians from owning\nveterinary practices, including Iowa, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York and\nNorth Carolina. The idea is to prevent corporate interests from guiding\nveterinarians\u2019 medical judgment.\n\nExperts and advocates expect to see further corporatization in veterinary care\nas more companies acquire not just vet clinics, but also other businesses\nacross the pet care spectrum.\n\nIn February, asset management behemoth Blackstone Inc. acquired Rover, the\nnation\u2019s largest online platform for pet sitting, dog walking and other\nservices. In the past two years, JAB has acquired several of the largest pet\ninsurance companies in the United States and Europe.\n\nEzell, the Alabama veterinarian, eventually decided to take a job at another\nclinic in town that\u2019s privately owned. She will start there in a few weeks.\n\n\u201cNot all corporate medicine is horrible, and you can find amazing\nveterinarians and caring support staff anywhere,\u201d she told Stateline.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s easy to lose sight of your values. The whole reason we\u2019re doing this\nis we want to make a difference in animals\u2019 and people\u2019s lives. If we\u2019re\nunable to do that, shouldn\u2019t we try to fix that?\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story has been updated to correct the number of Thrive\nveterinary hospitals.\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\n  * Alabama\n  * California\n  * Colorado\n  * Iowa\n  * Minnesota\n  * New Jersey\n  * New York\n  * North Carolina\n\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons\nlicense CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.
