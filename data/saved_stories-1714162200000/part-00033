Microsoft\u2019s cloud division now accounts for 57% of the\ncompany\u2019s entire revenue, as of last quarter.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM techradar\n\nIts renewed commitment to safety and security addresses recent breaches,\nincluding the infiltration by the Russian state-sponsored hacking group\nNobelium, and the Chinese hacking group Storm-0558.\n\nThe CSRB report called for an immediate overhaul, demanding that Nadella and\nthe Board of Directors take some responsibility for overseeing certain\nprocedures.\n\nNadella highlighted ongoing efforts to enhance protection while also\nbolstering threat monitoring and response capabilities. The company could also\nlearn from its own AI tool, Copilot for Security, which promises to deliver\nactionable insights.\n\n## Are you a pro?
