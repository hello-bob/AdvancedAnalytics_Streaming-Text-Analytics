When Vastaamo declined to pay, ransom_man\nshifted to extorting individual patients. According to Finnish police, some\n22,000 victims reported extortion attempts targeting them personally, targeted\nemails that threatened to publish their therapy notes online unless paid a 500\neuro ransom.\n\nFinnish prosecutors quickly zeroed in on a suspect: Julius \u201cZeekill\u201d Kivim\u00e4ki,\na notorious criminal hacker convicted of committing tens of thousands of\ncybercrimes before he became an adult. After being charged with the attack in\nOctober 2022, Kivim\u00e4ki fled the country. He was arrested four months later in\nFrance, hiding out under an assumed name and passport.\n\nAntti Kurittu is a former criminal investigator who worked on an investigation\ninvolving Kivim\u00e4ki\u2019s use of the Zbot botnet, among other activities Kivim\u00e4ki\nengaged in as a member of the hacker group Hack the Planet (HTP).\n\nKurittu said the prosecution had demanded at least seven years in jail, and\nthat the sentence handed down was six years and three months. Kurittu said\nprosecutors knocked a few months off of Kivim\u00e4ki\u2019s sentence because he agreed\nto pay compensation to his victims, and that Kivim\u00e4ki will remain in prison\nduring any appeal process.\n\n\u201cI think the sentencing was as expected, knowing the Finnish judicial system,\u201d\nKurittu told KrebsOnSecurity. \u201cAs Kivim\u00e4ki has not been sentenced to a non-\nsuspended prison sentence during the last five years, he will be treated as a\nfirst-timer, his previous convictions notwithstanding.\u201d\n\nBut because juvenile convictions in Finland don\u2019t count towards determining\nwhether somebody is a first-time offender, Kivim\u00e4ki will end up serving\napproximately half of his sentence.\n\n\u201cThis seems like a short sentence when taking into account the gravity of his\nactions and the life-altering consequences to thousands of people, but it\u2019s\nalmost the maximum the law allows for,\u201d Kurittu said.\n\nKivim\u00e4ki initially gained notoriety as a self-professed member of the Lizard\nSquad, a mainly low-skilled hacker group that specialized in DDoS attacks. But\nAmerican and Finnish investigators say Kivim\u00e4ki\u2019s involvement in cybercrime\ndates back to at least 2008, when he was introduced to a founding member of\nwhat would soon become HTP.\n\nFinnish police said Kivim\u00e4ki also used the nicknames \u201cRyan\u201d, \u201cRyanC\u201d and \u201cRyan\nCleary\u201d (Ryan Cleary was actually a member of a rival hacker group \u2014 LulzSec \u2014\nwho was sentenced to prison for hacking).\n\nKivim\u00e4ki and other HTP members were involved in mass-compromising web servers\nusing known vulnerabilities, and by 2012 Kivim\u00e4ki\u2019s alias Ryan Cleary was\nselling access to those servers in the form of a DDoS-for-hire service.\nKivim\u00e4ki was 15 years old at the time.\n\nIn 2013, investigators going through devices seized from Kivim\u00e4ki found\ncomputer code that had been used to crack more than 60,000 web servers using a\npreviously unknown vulnerability in Adobe\u2019s ColdFusion software.\nKrebsOnSecurity detailed the work of HTP in September 2013, after the group\ncompromised servers inside data brokers LexisNexis, Kroll, and Dun &\nBradstreet.\n\nThe group used the same ColdFusion flaws to break into the National White\nCollar Crime Center (NWC3), a non-profit that provides research and\ninvestigative support to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\n\nAs KrebsOnSecurity reported at the time, this small ColdFusion botnet of data\nbroker servers was being controlled by the same cybercriminals who\u2019d assumed\ncontrol over SSNDOB, which operated one of the underground\u2019s most reliable\nservices for obtaining Social Security Number, dates of birth and credit file\ninformation on U.S. residents.\n\nKivim\u00e4ki was responsible for making an August 2014 bomb threat against former\nSony Online Entertainment President John Smedley that grounded an American\nAirlines plane. Kivim\u00e4ki also was involved in calling in multiple fake bomb\nthreats and \u201cswatting\u201d incidents \u2014 reporting fake hostage situations at an\naddress to prompt a heavily armed police response to that location.\n\nVille Tapio, the former CEO of Vastaamo, was fired and also prosecuted\nfollowing the breach. Ransom_man bragged about Vastaamo\u2019s sloppy security,\nnoting the company had used the laughably weak username and password\n\u201croot/root\u201d to protect sensitive patient records.\n\nInvestigators later found Vastaamo had originally been hacked in 2018 and\nagain in 2019, but that Tapio never told anyone about the intrusions until\nransom_man began his extortion spree. In April 2023, a Finnish court handed\ndown a three-month sentence for Tapio, but that sentence was suspended because\nhe had no previous criminal record.\n\nThis entry was posted on Tuesday 30th of April 2024 09:34 AM\n\nNe'er-Do-Well News\n\nAntti Kurittu ColdFusion botnet hack the planet julius zeekill kivimaki Lizard\nSquad ransom_man Vastaamo Psychotherapy Center Ville Tapio\n\n## 2 thoughts on \u201cMan Who Mass-Extorted Psychotherapy Patients Gets Six Years\u201d\n\n  1.
