Even studying the field back in college,\nwhen there was only so much you could do with the lack of processing power,\ntooling and data, the possibilities were inspiring.\n\nArtificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach. It introduced a whole generation\n(and me) to core AI concepts.\n\nGenerative AI has unlocked a new peak of excitement and with that should come\nan ever increasing level of skepticism. It\u2019s easy to fall for the hype and\ntake at face value the headlines surrounding every new model, demo or paper,\nbut that excitement should be soon followed up by some level of diligence. I\u2019m\nstarting to see a bit more thoughtful push back on the unrestrained hype,\nwhich is a good sign that this AI cycle is maturing.\n\nLet\u2019s highlight a few recent examples.\n\n#\n\nOpenAI Sora\n\nSoon after Sora was announced, I wrote an article breaking down a series of\npromotional videos that were (partially) created by Sora. Here\u2019s what I said\nat the time:\n\n> Let me reiterate that Sora is an amazing accomplishment and looks like it\n> really is a major step forward for foundational video generation models.\n> With that being said, I think it\u2019s clear that between the inherent drawbacks\n> of the model by the way of its architecture and the lack of powerful and\n> fine grained controls, Sora will not replace the vast majority of video\n> generation tasks. At least not right away and not just by itself.\n\nSince then, shy kids shared more information about their process of working\nwith Sora to create their video \u201cAir Head.\u201d From a short video posted to their\nTwitter account, you can see example after example of raw Sora output that\nthey had to edit:\n\nSora raw output example 1: Balloon has a face that needed to be removed for\nthe final edit\n\nSora raw output example 2: Balloon present on top of the head, instead of\nbeing the whole head\n\nSora raw output example 3: A sort of cylinder head chasing a balloon instead\nof a balloon head\n\nAn in depth interview with The Hollywood Reporter features some additional\nperspective:\n\n> It has the same pitfalls as a lot of generative AI in that consistency is\n> difficult. Control is difficult, which as creatives, I mean, you want\n> control. That was our general feedback to the researchers: More control\n> would be great, because we want to try to tell a story using a consistent\n> character from shot to shot and from generation to generation. Part of that\n> is the reason why we ended up going with the guy with the balloon for a\n> head, because it\u2019s a little bit easier to tell that that\u2019s the same\n> character from shot to shot compared to someone whose face is changing.\n\n> It\u2019s not something that can replace people. I feel like if more people have\n> their hands on it, they\u2019d realize that for themselves pretty quickly, too.\n> It\u2019s not a magic box that will suddenly make you Stanley Kubrick.\n\n#\n\nDevin AI\n\nIn my article Can We Prevent LLMs From Hallucinating? I briefly wrote about\nDevin AI, the \u201cfirst AI software engineer\u201d:\n\n> The technology has promise and I am sure it will improve over time. But the\n> actual benchmarks today when you look at solving tasks end to end speak for\n> themselves...Would you hire a software engineer that solves problems\n> correctly 13.86% of the time? If you have to review every task for accuracy,\n> how much value does this provide today?\n\nCarl aka @internetOfBugs , a 35 year software developer, has since done an\namazing breakdown of Devin AI:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not anti AI, but I am anti Hype\u201d - this is a great perspective.\n\n#\n\nAmazon\u2019s Just Walk Out\n\nThis video published yesterday by ColdFusion caught my attention. The\nhighlight is the realization that Amazon\u2019s Just Walk Out in person shopping\nexperience was not powered by AI or technology but actually manually reviewed\nby 1,000 people in India:\n\n### Subscribe to Brett DiDonato\n\nLaunched a month ago\n\nLet's talk about the present and future of AI\n\nShare this post\n\n#### AI Skepticism is Reasonable (And Recommended)\n\nbrettdidonato.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nOpenAI Sora: Are we all seeing the same thing?\n\nOne of the most hyped AI announcements this year was when OpenAI announced\ntheir proprietary video generation model Sora last month.
