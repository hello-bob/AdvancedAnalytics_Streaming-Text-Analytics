We believe that\nadvancing adoption of blockchain platforms like Ethereum will help reshape and\nenhance how future generations will manage economic, financial, social,\npolitical, and technological systems, creating a more equitable, transparent,\nand innovative world.\n\nGuided by our mission, Consensys took an important step towards preserving\naccess to the Ethereum blockchain today, and by extension, permissionless\ninnovation. We filed litigation against the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (SEC).\n\nWe took this step for two very basic reasons: (1) the SEC should not be\nallowed to arbitrarily expand its jurisdiction to include regulating the\nfuture of the internet; and (2) the SEC\u2019s reckless approach is bringing chaos\nto developers, market participants, institutions, and nations who are building\nor already managing critical systems running on Ethereum, the world\u2019s largest\nplatform for decentralized applications. With our actions today we intend to\nmake the following clear:\n\n  * The SEC only has jurisdiction over securities and up until recently has declared that ether is not and should not be treated as a security.\n\n  * The SEC has no authority\u2014nor should it\u2014to regulate the technological evolution of the internet or any basic technology for that matter. Ether is the native token of the Ethereum blockchain. It can be traded as a commodity (like oil), but it is also essential to the technological development of applications built on Ethereum \u2013 including applications that have clear, non-financial utility for vital sectors like healthcare, energy, transport, media, agriculture, and beyond. The SEC's approach would make it impossible for developers to innovate and build, because it would classify non-financial platforms as financial applications thus requiring the SEC's oversight and approval.\n\n  * Applications such as MetaMask that allow people to buy, sell, and transfer ether on their own are not securities brokers. The MetaMask wallet, created by Consensys, gives users everything they need to explore web3; from managing their identity, sending and receiving cryptocurrency, to connecting to decentralized applications built on Ethereum. Declaring it a securities broker would effectively block web3 developers from continuing to build next generation applications themselves.\n\nWe have time and time again witnessed the current SEC contradict itself with\never-changing views on the blockchain, consistently mischaracterizing this\ntechnology and what is built on it as a shallow and doomed investment scheme,\nrather than as the breakthrough technology it is. Some of these common and\nprofound misunderstandings about blockchain technology and the benefits it\nwill bring are outlined here.\n\nWe fervently believe this technology will prove to be world-changing. Think\nback to the first time you touched the internet. Did you ever imagine devices\nlike iPhones, smart home devices and vehicles, or connected watches would be\npossible? That\u2019s the launchpad we stand on today with Ethereum\u2019s potential\u2014a\nmore transparent, accountable, and secure world, a world of possibilities\nwe\u2019re only just beginning to imagine and unlock. Ethereum must be allowed to\nmature so that we can each claim our right and power to be active builders of\nthe web.\n\nWe don\u2019t take this step lightly, but we feel compelled to act. Our action\ntoday is intended to protect the Ethereum ecosystem as well as the entirety of\nthe extended decentralized protocol ecosystem. Because Ethereum isn't just\nabout information being permissionless. It's about human ingenuity being\npermissionless.\n\nWe encourage others who feel the same way to make their voices heard and learn\nmore.\n\nEthereum is for everyone.\n\nJoe Lubin, Co-founder of Ethereum and Founder/CEO of Consensys\n\nConsensys\n\n  * Products\n  * Company\n  * Blog\n\n  * Log in\n\nProducts\n\n  * For everyone\n  * MetaMask\n  * MetaMask Institutional\n\n  * For developers\n  * MetaMask Developer\n  * Infura\n  * Diligence\n\n  * For the ecosystem\n  * Linea\n  * Consensys Staking\n  * Teku\n  * Besu\n\n  * Ecosystem\n\n  * Protocols and R&D\n  * Web3 Regulations\n  * Web3 Survey\n  * Ambassador Program\n  * Community\n  * Consensys Fellowship\n  * Ethereum Upgrade\n  * Scale Program & Partnerships\n\n  * Social\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Youtube\n  * Discord\n  * Instagram\n\n  * Company\n\n  * About\n  * Press\n  * Careers\n  * Security\n  * Contact\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms of Use\n\n", "frontpage": false}
