I'm so angry.\n\nThis may come as a surprise, but as a blogger, it's very difficult to reach\nyour audience and to be heard, no matter how good or deep or useful your\narticles are. Unless you post \"hot takes\" or have a huge marketing budget,\nthat is.\n\nOne of the few options is to post to HN/Lobsters and hope for a (slim) chance\nof getting noticed. And yes, authors often have to submit their own stuff\nbecause readers rarely do (again, no matter how good the article is).\n\nAnd yet the platform gatekeepers do everything in their power to keep authors\nfrom posting. They enforce these ridiculous \"anti-self-promotion\" policies\n(where's the promotion, by the way? It's not like authors are trying to sell\nanything, they're just trying to be heard).\n\nPlatforms like HN and Lobsters already have powerful collaboration-based\nmechanisms to protect them from bad content: voting and flagging. Bad articles\ndon't get upvoted, so no one sees them. Offensive content and spam are flagged\nand removed. The community is perfectly capable of deciding what content it\nwants to see on the platform. And yet moderators choose to abuse their power\nby banning authors for \"self-promotion\".\n\nDespite what the platform owners say, they don't give a damn about \"quality\ncontent\". Instead, they welcome all kinds of hype (which is what people\ngenerally submit), corporate blogs with fat budgets, and a small number of\ntech celebrities.\n\nWell, you know what? Fuck you, Lobsters. I'm going to submit every single\narticle by this author.\n\nEat that.\n\n  1. Lobsters \u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  2.
