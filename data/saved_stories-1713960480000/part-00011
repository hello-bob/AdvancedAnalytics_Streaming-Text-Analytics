Thousands have been killed, and hundreds of thousands have been\ndisplaced. At present, there are 7.1 million displaced people in the\nDemocratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Violence of this scale is not without\nprecedent, with the conflict in Eastern DRC leading to an approximate 6\nmillion deaths since 1996.\n\nIn November 2023, an unidentified man in the capital Kinshasa set himself on\nfire while holding a sign reading \u201cStop the Genocide in Congo.\u201d Another man,\nCedrick Nianza, did the same in 2011 while shouting Congo na nga, Congo na nga\n(my Congo, my Congo).\n\nViolence and conflict inflicted on the people in the Congo has a history. Over\na century ago, one of the worst atrocities in recorded history occurred in the\nDRC with King Leopold II\u2019s genocide of 10 million African people during his\ncolonial rule over Congo from 1885 to 1908.\n\nThe modern conflict includes ethnically motivated killings, which have been a\nfrequent reality in Congo since the spillover from the 1994 genocide against\nthe Tutsi people occuring in their neighbor country Rwanda. Thirty years\nlater, the M23 claims to defend the Tutsi from further acts of genocide.\n\nAlong with the ethnic divisions, the modern conflicts are fuelled by a diverse\nconstellation of internal, regional, and international actors with the\nessential factor driving the violence being control over resources.\n\nAlmost all new technology, especially what is described as \u2018green tech,\u2019\nrequires materials such as lithium, cobalt, copper, and tin. The Eastern\nregions of the DRC are rich in these materials \u2013 as well as in diamonds and\npetroleum \u2013 and are thus subject to fierce contestations by local militias,\nbacked by foreign governments (such as Rwanda in the case of the M23 militia),\nand international capital. Those that mine for these materials experience\nhorrible conditions, with many accounts of slave labor and child labor. These\nsame minerals are bought by international companies and create technologies\nsuch as smart phones, laptops, electric vehicles, solar panels, ear pods,\nspeakers \u2013 basically anything with a battery.\n\nMany activists are calling for a boycott of new tech and insist that the\ntransition to green technology \u2013 a phrase used to indicate a switch to more\necological forms of energy production \u2013 cannot be built with the blood of\nCongolese men, women, and children.\n\nThis is the third in a series visualizing genocides across the globe created\nby Hisham Rifai and Ayman Makarem. See the first two specials, Resisting\nStarvation in Gaza and \u2018Zaghrouda\u2019 in the Midst of the Sudan War below.\n\nThe artistic duo has also created the Revolution in Every Country comic series\non revolutionary movement events and ideas in the SWANA (South West Asia and\nNorth Africa) region.\n\n## Artist Bios:\n\nAyman Makarem is a Lebanese writer primarily interested in the intersection of\nthe personal and the political.\n\nHisham Rifai is a Lebanese artist and illustrator. He is currently based in\nAntwerp, Belgium completing an advanced master\u2019s in research in arts and\ndesign.
