Some 8 billion years later, radio waves from that\nburst reached Earth and were captured by a sophisticated low-frequency radio\ntelescope in the Australian outback.\n\nThe signal, which arrived on June 10, 2022, and lasted for under half a\nmillisecond, is one of a growing class of mysterious radio signals called fast\nradio bursts. In the last 10 years, astronomers have picked up nearly 5,000 of\nthem. This one was particularly special: nearly double the age of anything\npreviously observed, and three and a half times more energetic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut like the others that came before, it was otherwise a mystery. No one knows\nwhat causes fast radio bursts. They flash in a seemingly random and\nunpredictable pattern from all over the sky. Some appear from within our\ngalaxy, others from previously unexamined depths of the universe. Some repeat\nin cyclical patterns for days at a time and then vanish; others have been\nconsistently repeating every few days since we first identified them. Most\nnever repeat at all.\n\nDespite the mystery, these radio waves are starting to prove extraordinarily\nuseful. By the time our telescopes detect them, they have passed through\nclouds of hot, rippling plasma, through gas so diffuse that particles barely\ntouch each other, and through our own Milky Way. And every time they hit the\nfree electrons floating in all that stuff, the waves shift a little bit. The\nones that reach our telescopes carry with them a smeary fingerprint of all the\nordinary matter they\u2019ve encountered between wherever they came from and where\nwe are now.\n\nThis makes fast radio bursts, or FRBs, invaluable tools for scientific\ndiscovery\u2014especially for astronomers interested in the very diffuse gas and\ndust floating between galaxies, which we know very little about.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what they are, and we don\u2019t know what causes them. But it\ndoesn\u2019t matter. This is the tool we would have constructed and developed if we\nhad the chance to be playing God and create the universe,\u201d says Stuart Ryder,\nan astronomer at Macquarie University in Sydney and the lead author of the\nScience paper that reported the record-breaking burst.\n\n## Related Story\n\nWhat\u2019s next in space\n\nThe moon, private space travel, and the wider solar system will all have major\nmissions over the next 12 months.\n\nMany astronomers now feel confident that finding more such distant FRBs will\nenable them to create the most detailed three-dimensional cosmological map\never made\u2014what Ryder likens to a CT scan of the universe. Even just five years\nago making such a map might have seemed an intractable technical challenge:\nspotting an FFB and then recording enough data to determine where it came from\nis extraordinarily difficult because most of that work must happen in the few\nmilliseconds before the burst passes.\n\nBut that challenge is about to be obliterated. By the end of this decade, a\nnew generation of radio telescopes and related technologies coming online in\nAustralia, Canada, Chile, California, and elsewhere should transform the\neffort to find FRBs\u2014and help unpack what they can tell us. What was once a\nseries of serendipitous discoveries will become something that\u2019s almost\nroutine. Not only will astronomers be able to build out that new map of the\nuniverse, but they\u2019ll have the chance to vastly improve our understanding of\nhow galaxies are born and how they change over time.\n\n### Where\u2019s the matter?\n\nIn 1998, astronomers counted up the weight of all of the identified matter in\nthe universe and got a puzzling result.\n\nWe know that about 5% of the total weight of the universe is made up of\nbaryons like protons and neutrons\u2014 the particles that make up atoms, or all\nthe \u201cstuff\u201d in the universe. (The other 95% includes dark energy and dark\nmatter.) But the astronomers managed to locate only about 2.5%, not 5%, of the\nuniverse\u2019s total. \u201cThey counted the stars, black holes, white dwarfs, exotic\nobjects, the atomic gas, the molecular gas in galaxies, the hot plasma, etc.\nThey added it all up and wound up at least a factor of two short of what it\nshould have been,\u201d says Xavier Prochaska, an astrophysicist at the University\nof California, Santa Cruz, and an expert in analyzing the light in the early\nuniverse. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing. We\u2019re not actively observing half of the matter\nin the universe.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll those missing baryons were a serious problem for simulations of how\ngalaxies form, how our universe is structured, and what happens as it\ncontinues to expand.\n\nAstronomers began to speculate that the missing matter exists in extremely\ndiffuse clouds of what\u2019s known as the warm\u2013hot intergalactic medium, or WHIM.\nTheoretically, the WHIM would contain all that unobserved material. After the\n1998 paper was published, Prochaska committed himself to finding it.\n\nBut nearly 10 years of his life and about $50 million in taxpayer money later,\nthe hunt was going very poorly.\n\nThat search had focused largely on picking apart the light from distant\ngalactic nuclei and studying x-ray emissions from tendrils of gas connecting\ngalaxies. The breakthrough came in 2007, when Prochaska was sitting on a couch\nin a meeting room at the University of California, Santa Cruz, reviewing new\nresearch papers with his colleagues. There, amid the stacks of research, sat\nthe paper reporting the discovery of the first FRB.\n\nDuncan Lorimer and David Narkevic, astronomers at West Virginia University,\nhad discovered a recording of an energetic radio wave unlike anything\npreviously observed. The wave lasted for less than five milliseconds, and its\nspectral lines were very smeared and distorted, unusual characteristics for a\nradio pulse that was also brighter and more energetic than other known\ntransient phenomena. The researchers concluded that the wave could not have\ncome from within our galaxy, meaning that it had traveled some unknown\ndistance through the universe.\n\nHere was a signal that had traversed long distances of space, been shaped and\naffected by electrons along the way, and had enough energy to be clearly\ndetectable despite all the stuff it had passed through. There are no other\nsignals we can currently detect that commonly occur throughout the universe\nand have this exact set of traits.\n\n\u201cI saw that and I said, \u2018Holy cow\u2014that\u2019s how we can solve the missing-baryons\nproblem,\u2019\u201d Prochaska says. Astronomers had used a similar technique with the\nlight from pulsars\u2014 spinning neutron stars that beam radiation from their\npoles\u2014to count electrons in the Milky Way. But pulsars are too dim to\nilluminate more of the universe. FRBs were thousands of times brighter,\noffering a way to use that technique to study space well beyond our galaxy.\n\nThis visualization of large-scale structure in the universe shows galaxies\n(bright knots) and the filaments of material between them.\n\nNASA/NCSA UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS VISUALIZATION BY FRANK SUMMERS, SPACE\nTELESCOPE SCIENCE INSTITUTE, SIMULATION BY MARTIN WHITE AND LARS HERNQUIST,\nHARVARD UNIVERSITY\n\nThere\u2019s a catch, though: in order for an FRB to be an indicator of what lies\nin the seemingly empty space between galaxies, researchers have to know where\nit comes from. If you don\u2019t know how far the FRB has traveled, you can\u2019t make\nany definitive estimate of what space looks like between its origin point and\nEarth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAstronomers couldn\u2019t even point to the direction that the first 2007 FRB came\nfrom, let alone calculate the distance it had traveled. It was detected by an\nenormous single-dish radio telescope at the Parkes Observatory (now called the\nMurriyang) in New South Wales, which is great at picking up incoming radio\nwaves but can pinpoint FRBs only to an area of the sky as large as Earth\u2019s\nfull moon. For the next decade, telescopes continued to identify FRBs without\nproviding a precise origin, making them a fascinating mystery but not\npractically useful.\n\nThen, in 2015, one particular radio wave flashed\u2014and then flashed again. Over\nthe course of two months of observation from the Arecibo telescope in Puerto\nRico, the radio waves came again and again, flashing 10 times. This was the\nfirst repeating burst of FRBs ever observed (a mystery in its own right), and\nnow researchers had a chance to determine where the radio waves had begun,\nusing the opportunity to home in on its location.\n\nIn 2017, that\u2019s what happened. The researchers obtained an accurate position\nfor the fast radio burst using the NRAO Very Large Array telescope in central\nNew Mexico. Armed with that position, the researchers then used the Gemini\noptical telescope in Hawaii to take a picture of the location, revealing the\ngalaxy where the FRB had begun and how far it had traveled. \u201cThat\u2019s when it\nbecame clear that at least some of these we\u2019d get the distance for. That\u2019s\nwhen I got really involved and started writing telescope proposals,\u201d Prochaska\nsays.\n\nThat same year, astronomers from across the globe gathered in Aspen, Colorado,\nto discuss the potential for studying FRBs. Researchers debated what caused\nthem. Neutron stars? Magnetars, neutron stars with such powerful magnetic\nfields that they emit x-rays and gamma rays? Merging galaxies? Aliens? Did\nrepeating FRBs and one-offs have different origins, or could there be some\nother explanation for why some bursts repeat and most do not? Did it even\nmatter, since all the bursts could be used as probes regardless of what caused\nthem? At that Aspen meeting, Prochaska met with a team of radio astronomers\nbased in Australia, including Keith Bannister, a telescope expert involved in\nthe early work to build a precursor facility for the Square Kilometer Array,\nan international collaboration to build the largest radio telescope arrays in\nthe world.\n\nThe construction of that precursor telescope, called ASKAP, was still underway\nduring that meeting. But Bannister, a telescope expert at the Australian\ngovernment\u2019s scientific research agency, CSIRO, believed that it could be\nrequisitioned and adapted to simultaneously locate and observe FRBs.\n\nBannister and the other radio experts affiliated with ASKAP understood how to\nmanipulate radio telescopes for the unique demands of FRB hunting; Prochaska\nwas an expert in everything \u201cnot radio.\u201d They agreed to work together to\nidentify and locate one-off FRBs (because there are many more of these than\nthere are repeating ones) and then use the data to address the problem of the\nmissing baryons.\n\nAnd over the course of the next five years, that\u2019s exactly what they did\u2014with\nastonishing success.\n\n### Building a pipeline\n\nTo pinpoint a burst in the sky, you need a telescope with two things that have\ntraditionally been at odds in radio astronomy: a very large field of view and\nhigh resolution. The large field of view gives you the greatest possible\nchance to detect a fleeting, unpredictable burst. High resolution lets you\ndetermine where that burst actually sits in your field of view.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nASKAP was the perfect candidate for the job. Located in the westernmost part\nof the Australian outback, where cattle and sheep graze on public land and\npeople are few and far between, the telescope consists of 36 dishes, each with\na large field of view. These dishes are separated by large distances, allowing\nobservations to be combined through a technique called interferometry so that\na small patch of the sky can be viewed with high precision.\n\nThe dishes weren\u2019t formally in use yet, but Bannister had an idea. He took\nthem and jerry-rigged a \u201cfly\u2019s eye\u201d telescope, pointing the dishes at\ndifferent parts of the sky to maximize its ability to spot something that\nmight flash anywhere.\n\n\u201cSuddenly, it felt like we were living in paradise,\u201d Bannister says. \u201cThere\nhad only ever been three or four FRB detections at this point, and people\nweren\u2019t entirely sure if [FRBs] were real or not, and we were finding them\nevery two weeks.\u201d\n\nWhen ASKAP\u2019s interferometer went online in September 2018, the real work\nbegan. Bannister designed a piece of software that he likens to live-action\nreplay of the FRB event. \u201cThis thing comes by and smacks into your telescope\nand disappears, and you\u2019ve got a millisecond to get its phone number,\u201d he\nsays. To do so, the software detects the presence of an FRB within a hundredth\nof a second and then reaches upstream to create a recording of the telescope\u2019s\ndata before the system overwrites it. Data from all the dishes can be\nprocessed and combined to reconstruct a view of the sky and find a precise\npoint of origin.\n\nThe team can then send the coordinates on to optical telescopes, which can\ntake detailed pictures of the spot to confirm the presence of a galaxy\u2014the\nlikely origin point of the FRB.\n\nThese two dishes are part of CSIRO's Australian Square Kilometre Array\nPathfinder (ASKAP) telescope.\n\nCSIRO\n\nRyder\u2019s team used data on the galaxy\u2019s spectrum, gathered from the European\nSouthern Observatory, to measure how much its light stretched as it traversed\nspace to reach our telescopes. This \u201credshift\u201d becomes a proxy for distance,\nallowing astronomers to estimate just how much space the FRB\u2019s light has\npassed through.\n\nIn 2018, the live-action replay worked for the first time, making Bannister,\nRyder, Prochaska, and the rest of their research team the first to localize an\nFRB that was not repeating. By the following year, the team had localized\nabout five of them. By 2020, they had published a paper in Nature declaring\nthat the FRBs had let them count up the universe\u2019s missing baryons.\n\nThe centerpiece of the paper\u2019s argument was something called the dispersion\nmeasure\u2014a number that reflects how much an FRB\u2019s light has been smeared by all\nthe free electrons along our line of sight. In general, the farther an FRB\ntravels, the higher the dispersion measure should be. Armed with both the\ntravel distance (the redshift) and the dispersion measure for a number of\nFRBs, the researchers found they could extrapolate the total density of\nparticles in the universe. J-P Macquart, the paper\u2019s lead author, believed\nthat the relationship between dispersion measure and FRB distance was\npredictable and could be applied to map the universe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a leader in the field and a key player in the advancement of FRB research,\nMacquart would have been interviewed for this piece. But he died of a heart\nattack one week after the paper was published, at the age of 45. FRB\nresearchers began to call the relationship between dispersion and distance the\n\u201cMacquart relation,\u201d in honor of his memory and his push for the\ngroundbreaking idea that FRBs could be used for cosmology.\n\nProving that the Macquart relation would hold at greater distances became not\njust a scientific quest but also an emotional one.\n\n> \u201cI remember thinking that I know something about the universe that no one\n> else knows.\u201d\n\nThe researchers knew that the ASKAP telescope was capable of detecting bursts\nfrom very far away\u2014they just needed to find one. Whenever the telescope\ndetected an FRB, Ryder was tasked with helping to determine where it had\noriginated. It took much longer than he would have liked. But one morning in\nJuly 2022, after many months of frustration, Ryder downloaded the newest data\nemail from the European Southern Observatory and began to scroll through the\nspectrum data. Scrolling, scrolling, scrolling\u2014and then there it was: light\nfrom 8 billion years ago, or a redshift of one, symbolized by two very close,\nbright lines on the computer screen, showing the optical emissions from\noxygen. \u201cI remember thinking that I know something about the universe that no\none else knows,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to jump onto a Slack and tell everyone,\nbut then I thought: No, just sit here and revel in this. It has taken a lot to\nget to this point.\u201d\n\nWith the October 2023 Science paper, the team had basically doubled the\ndistance baseline for the Macquart relation, honoring Macquart\u2019s memory in the\nbest way they knew how. The distance jump was significant because Ryder and\nthe others on his team wanted to confirm that their work would hold true even\nfor FRBs whose light comes from so far away that it reflects a much younger\nuniverse. They also wanted to establish that it was possible to find FRBs at\nthis redshift, because astronomers need to collect evidence about many more\nlike this one in order to create the cosmological map that motivates so much\nFRB research.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging that the Macquart relation does still seem to hold, and that\nwe can still see fast radio bursts coming from those distances,\u201d Ryder said.\n\u201cWe assume that there are many more out there.\u201d\n\n### Mapping the cosmic web\n\nThe missing stuff that lies between galaxies, which should contain the\nmajority of the matter in the universe, is often called the cosmic web. The\ndiffuse gases aren\u2019t floating like random clouds; they\u2019re strung together more\nlike a spiderweb, a complex weaving of delicate filaments that stretches as\nthe galaxies at their nodes grow and shift. This gas probably escaped from\ngalaxies into the space beyond when the galaxies first formed, shoved outward\nby massive explosions.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t understand how gas is pushed in and out of galaxies. It\u2019s\nfundamental for understanding how galaxies form and evolve,\u201d says Kiyoshi\nMasui, the director of MIT\u2019s Synoptic Radio Lab. \u201cWe only exist because stars\nexist, and yet this process of building up the building blocks of the universe\nis poorly understood ... Our ability to model that is the gaping hole in our\nunderstanding of how the universe works.\u201d\n\nAstronomers are also working to build large-scale maps of galaxies in order to\nprecisely measure the expansion of the universe. But the cosmological modeling\nunderway with FRBs should create a picture of invisible gasses between\ngalaxies, one that currently does not exist. To build a three-dimensional map\nof this cosmic web, astronomers will need precise data on thousands of FRBs\nfrom regions near Earth and from very far away, like the FRB at redshift one.\n\u201cUltimately, fast radio bursts will give you a very detailed picture of how\ngas gets pushed around,\u201d Masui says. \u201cTo get to the cosmological data, samples\nhave to get bigger, but not a lot bigger.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s the task at hand for Masui, who leads a team searching for FRBs much\ncloser to our galaxy than the ones found by the Australian-led collaboration.\nMasui\u2019s team conducts FRB research with the CHIME telescope in British\nColumbia, a nontraditional radio telescope with a very wide field of view and\nfocusing reflectors that look like half-pipes instead of dishes. CHIME (short\nfor \u201cCanadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment)\u201d has no moving parts and\nis less reliant on mirrors than a traditional telescope (focusing light in\nonly one direction rather than two), instead using digital techniques to\nprocess its data. CHIME can use its digital technology to focus on many places\nat once, creating a 200-square-degree field of view compared with ASKAP\u2019s\n30-degree one. Masui likened it to a mirror that can be focused on thousands\nof different places simultaneously.\n\nBecause of this enormous field of view, CHIME has been able to gather data on\nthousands of bursts that are closer to the Milky Way. While CHIME cannot yet\nprecisely locate where they are coming from the way that ASKAP can (the\ntelescope is much more compact, providing lower resolution), Masui is leading\nthe effort to change that by building three smaller versions of the same\ntelescope in British Columbia; Green Bank, West Virginia; and Northern\nCalifornia. The additional data provided by these telescopes, the first of\nwhich will probably be collected sometime this year, can be combined with data\nfrom the original CHIME telescope to produce location information that is\nabout 1,000 times more precise. That should be detailed enough for\ncosmological mapping.\n\nThe reflectors of the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment, or\nCHIME, have been used to spot thousands of FRBs.\n\nANDRE RECNIK/CHIME\n\nTelescope technology is improving so fast that the quest to gather enough FRB\nsamples from different parts of the universe for a cosmological map could be\nfinished within the next 10 years. In addition to CHIME, the BURSTT radio\ntelescope in Taiwan should go online this year; the CHORD telescope in Canada,\ndesigned to surpass CHIME, should begin operations in 2025; and the Deep\nSynoptic Array in California could transform the field of radio astronomy when\nit\u2019s finished, which is expected to happen sometime around the end of the\ndecade.\n\nAnd at ASKAP, Bannister is building a new tool that will quintuple the\nsensitivity of the telescope, beginning this year. If you can imagine stuffing\na million people simultaneously watching uncompressed YouTube videos into a\nbox the size of a fridge, that\u2019s probably the easiest way to visualize the\ndata handling capabilities of this new processor, called a field-programmable\ngate array, which Bannister is almost finished programming. He expects the new\ndevice to allow the team to detect one new FRB each day.\n\nWith all the telescopes in competition, Bannister says, \u201cin five or 10 years\u2019\ntime, there will be 1,000 new FRBs detected before you can write a paper about\nthe one you just found ... We\u2019re in a race to make them boring.\u201d\n\nProchaska is so confident FRBs will finally give us the cosmological map he\u2019s\nbeen working toward his entire life that he\u2019s started studying for a degree in\noceanography. Once astronomers have measured distances for 1,000 of the\nbursts, he plans to give up the work entirely.\n\n\u201cIn a decade, we could have a pretty decent cosmological map that\u2019s very\nprecise,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what the 1,000 FRBs are for\u2014and I should be fired\nif we don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nUnlike most scientists, Prochaska can define the end goal. He knows that all\nthose FRBs should allow astronomers to paint a map of the invisible gases in\nthe universe, creating a picture of how galaxies evolve as gases move outward\nand then fall back in. FRBs will grant us an understanding of the shape of the\nuniverse that we don\u2019t have today\u2014even if the mystery of what makes them\nendures.\n\nAnna Kramer is a science and climate journalist based in Washington, D.C.\n\n### by Anna Kramer\n\n### Share\n\n  * Share story on linkedin\n\n  * Share story on twitter\n\n  * Share story on facebook\n\n  * Share story on email\n\n  * ### Popular\n\n    1.
