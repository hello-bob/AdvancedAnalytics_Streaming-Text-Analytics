Now, for the first time, \u201cLockBitSupp\u201d has\nbeen unmasked by an international law enforcement team, and a $10 million\nbounty has been placed for his arrest.\n\nIn an indictment unsealed Tuesday, US federal prosecutors unmasked the\nflamboyant persona as Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev, a 51-year-old Russian\nnational. Prosecutors said that during his five years at the helm of\nLockBit\u2014one of the most prolific ransomware groups\u2014Khoroshev and his\nsubordinates have extorted $500 million from some 2,500 victims, roughly 1,800\nof which were located in the US. His cut of the revenue was allegedly about\n$100 million.\n\n## Damage in the billions of dollars\n\n\u201cBeyond ransom payments and demands, LockBit attacks also severely disrupted\ntheir victims' operations, causing lost revenue and expenses associated with\nincident response and recovery,\u201d federal prosecutors wrote. \u201cWith these losses\nincluded, LockBit caused damage around the world totaling billions of US\ndollars. Moreover, the data Khoroshev and his LockBit affiliate co-\nconspirators stole\u2014containing highly sensitive organizational and personal\ninformation\u2014remained unsecure and compromised in perpetuity, notwithstanding\nKhoroshev\u2019s and his co-conspirators' false promises to the contrary.\u201d\n\nThe indictment charges the Russian national with one count of conspiracy to\ncommit fraud, extortion, and related activity in connection with computers,\none count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, eight counts of intentional\ndamage to a protected computer, eight counts of extortion in relation to\nconfidential information from a protected computer, and eight counts of\nextortion in relation to damage to a protected computer. If convicted,\nKhoroshev faces a maximum penalty of 185 years in prison.\n\nIn addition to the indictment, officials in the US Treasury Department\u2014along\nwith counterparts in the UK and Australia\u2014announced sanctions against\nKhoroshev. Among other things, the US sanctions allow officials to impose\ncivil penalties on any US person who makes or facilitates payments to the\nLockBit group. The US State Department also announced a $10 million reward for\nany information leading to Khoroshev\u2019s arrest and or conviction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Rooting out LockBit\n\n### Further Reading\n\nAfter years of losing, it\u2019s finally feds\u2019 turn to troll ransomware group\n\nTuesday\u2019s actions come 11 weeks after law enforcement agencies in the US and\n10 other countries struck a major blow to the infrastructure LockBit members\nused to operate their ransomware-as-a-service enterprise. Images federal\nauthorities posted to the dark web site where LockBit named and shamed victims\nindicated they had taken control of /etc/shadow, a Linux file that stores\ncryptographically hashed passwords. The file, among the most security-\nsensitive ones in Linux, can be accessed only by a user with root, the highest\nlevel of system privileges.\n\nIn all, the authorities said in February, they seized control of 14,000\nLockBit-associated accounts and 34 servers located in the Netherlands,\nGermany, Finland, France, Switzerland, Australia, the US, and the UK. Two\nLockBit suspects were arrested in Poland and Ukraine, and five indictments and\nthree arrest warrants were issued. The authorities also froze 200\ncryptocurrency accounts linked to the ransomware operation. The UK\u2019s National\nCrime Agency on Tuesday said the number of active LockBit affiliates has\nfallen from 114 to 69 since the February action, named Operation Cronos.\n\nIn mid-March, an Ontario, Canada, man convicted on charges for working for\nLockBit was sentenced to four years in prison. Mikhail Vasiliev, 33 years old\nat the time of sentencing, was arrested in November 2022 and charged with\nconspiring to infect protected computers with ransomware and sending ransom\ndemands to victims. He pleaded guilty in February to eight counts of cyber\nextortion, mischief, and weapons charges.\n\nThe real-world identity of Khoroshev\u2019s LockBitSupp alter ego has been hotly\nsought after for years. LockBitSupp thrived on his anonymity in frequent posts\nto Russian-speaking hacking forums, where he boasted about the prowess and\nacumen of his work. At one point, he promised a $10 million reward to anyone\nwho revealed his identity. After February\u2019s operation taking down much of the\nLockBit infrastructure, prosecutors hinted that they knew who LockBitSupp was\nbut stopped short of naming him.\n\nLockBit has operated since at least 2019 and has also been known under the\nname \u201cABCD\u201d in the past. Within three years of its founding, the group\u2019s\nmalware was the most widely circulating ransomware. Like most of its peers,\nLockBit has operated under what\u2019s known as ransomware-as-a-service, in which\nit provides software and infrastructure to affiliates who use it to do the\nactual hacking. LockBit and the affiliates then divide any resulting revenue.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Scientists Respond to Science Deniers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n28\n\nDan Goodin Dan Goodin is Senior Security Editor at Ars Technica, where he\noversees coverage of malware, computer espionage, botnets, hardware hacking,\nencryption, and passwords.
