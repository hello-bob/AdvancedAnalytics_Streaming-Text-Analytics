The idea seemed to\ncome from nowhere. For those familiar with Musk\u2019s history, however, both the\nname and the idea would have sounded familiar.\n\nMusk is usually credited as one of the founders of PayPal. The story of the\npayments company\u2019s rise and eventual sale to eBay for $1.5 billion is often\nelided in Musk\u2019s own personal history. But behind that sale is a tale of\nobsession, ambition, and a series of brutal boardroom coups\u2014one of which was\nsprung on him by Peter Thiel during his honeymoon\u2014that, in Musk\u2019s eyes, robbed\nhim of both the company he originally founded and a chance to change the\nworld.\n\nThat company was X, and the world-changing idea was to create a \u201cglobal\nfinancial nexus,\u201d as Musk would describe his vision. Throughout his career, it\nhas remained the one great idea that he feels got away. Far from being a\nsurprise, Musk\u2019s Twitter pivot is an attempt to revive, and finally build,\nthat dream.\n\nTo understand the future of X, then, it\u2019s critical to understand its past. The\nrise and fall of X\u2019s previous incarnation\u2014and his first attempt to dominate\nfintech\u2014has fallen out of his narrative. Though its history may read like an\nepisode of Succession, it has defined Musk\u2019s approach to company control and\nownership ever since. Now it seems set to define the future of Twitter as\nwell.\n\nThis is the story of X, based on contemporary articles, published videos and\ninterviews with key players such as Elon Musk and Harris Fricker, and books\n(including The PayPal Wars by Eric M. Jackson and The Founders by Jimmy Soni).\n\n### \u2018The drive of a nuclear submarine\u2019\n\nIn late 1998, Harris Fricker, a financial securities expert, received a call\nfrom Peter Nicholson, an old boss at ScotiaBank.\n\n\u201c\u2018I want you to meet this kid,\u2019 [Nicholson] said,\u201d Fricker told the C4K\npodcast many years later. \u201cSo I said, \u2018Sure.\u2019 I met the guy and he was\nincredible. Huge engine. Huge intellect. The drive of a nuclear submarine.\u201d\n\nThe \u201ckid\u201d had also worked for Nicholson. As an intern, he had become\nfrustrated that his ideas for high-risk, high-reward deals weren\u2019t implemented\nby the bank. Although Nicholson hadn\u2019t acted on these ideas, he was impressed\nwith the intern\u2019s drive and intellect, so they stayed in touch. That was\nalmost 10 years ago, and things had changed. The kid, now 27, was about to\nbecome a dot-com millionaire for the first time, and he contacted Nicholson to\nsay that he was already planning his next venture. For that he needed someone\nwho knew finance, so Nicholson pointed him to Fricker.\n\nThe kid was Elon Musk.\n\nMusk bombarded Fricker with details of his new plan. Zip2, the online\nclassifieds firm he had founded with his brother, Kimbal, was about to sell,\nand sell big (in February 1999, Compaq bought it for $305 million). Musk\u2019s\nshare would be just over $20 million, and with it, he told Fricker, he\nintended to launch something even bigger and more ambitious. Something the\nworld had never seen before.\n\nUnlock the power of AI and learn to create your personal AI chatbot in just 30\ndays with our cohort-based course.\n\nHere's what you'll learn:\n\n  * Master AI fundamentals like GPT-4, ChatGPT, vector databases, and LLM libraries\n  * Learn to build, code, and ship a versatile AI chatbot\n  * Enhance your writing, decision-making, and ideation with your AI assistant\n\nWhat's included:\n\n  * Weekly live sessions and expert mentorship\n  * Access to our thriving AI community\n  * Hands-on projects and in-depth lessons\n  * Live Q&A sessions with industry experts\n  * A step-by-step roadmap to launch your AI assistant\n  * The chance to launch your chatbot to Every's 85,000 person audience\n\nThere are limited seats so sign up now to take advantage.

He wanted to create something\nthat would bring all the financial aspects of a person\u2019s life into a single\nplace, which he referred to as an \u201conline financial superstore.\u201d Here, users\nand businesses would hold and manage everything: checking and savings\naccounts. Mortgages. Stocks and shares. Loans. Insurance. It would be a global\nfinancial nexus\u2014a mega-app that users would never have to leave.\n\nFricker was intrigued, but he was also reluctant to leave his multi-million-\ndollar job to help Musk chase his dream. Musk kept working on him, however,\nand after Compaq\u2019s purchase of Zip2 was completed, Fricker found himself\nquitting his job in Canada and heading for Silicon Valley, where he became a\nco-founder of Musk\u2019s new firm.\n\n\u201cElon knew nothing about financial services,\u201d Fricker later told C4K. \u201cBut\nwith his audacity, and his ability to articulate a vision people would get\nbehind, it was a pretty interesting combination.\u201d\n\nInteresting, it soon became clear, could be both good and bad. Fricker was\nsurprised, for example, to discover that Musk had already become fixated on a\nname for the company. It would be called X.\n\nFricker and others expressed reservations. Banking was about trust and\nopenness, and X hardly connoted either. Musk, however, was laser-focused on\nusing it as the brand. He described x.com\u2014one of the few single-letter domains\nregistered before their use was blocked\u2014as \u201cthe coolest URL on the internet\u201d\nand informed Fricker that he\u2019d already purchased it, giving its previous\nowner, Pittsburgh PowerComputer, 1.5 million shares of Series A stock in\nreturn. X marks the spot for treasure, he told a dubious Fricker and others.\nThat\u2019s how he saw it. That\u2019s how others would, too. Also, it was short and\neasy to type, Musk said. His decision was final.\n\nMusk\u2019s ability to override the concerns of others at X was based not only on\nhis position as CEO of the startup, but also on the investment he had made to\nget it going. Although later funding rounds would dilute his share, X began\nwith an investment of $12.5 million of Musk\u2019s own money. As a result, the\nfirm\u2019s culture and goals were almost entirely driven by Musk himself.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before the relationship between Fricker and Musk began to break\ndown. Fricker and the financial team he\u2019d assembled became increasingly\nconcerned about Musk\u2019s attitude toward regulation and verification. Musk\ntended to see regulation as a barrier to be eluded, rather than as something\nthrough which he needed to carefully navigate, and he insisted that growth\nmattered much more than inserting impediments that would prevent users from\naccessing X\u2019s services.\n\nOver time, Fricker also grew concerned that for all of Musk\u2019s talk to the\nmedia, investors, and X employees about his grand plan, the development of\nactual products seemed to be proceeding slowly. Musk and his developers\nrejected this suggestion, insisting that the financial side of the firm didn\u2019t\nunderstand the rapid release-and-iterate approach they planned to take. But as\nthey headed toward a 1999 debut, Fricker and Musk frequently argued over just\nwhat would be launching. By the time X opened its digital gates, in a blaze of\npublicity in December of that year, Fricker was gone. He arrived at work one\nmorning to find his computer wiped and his access suspended. Musk had fired\nhim.\n\nDespite the turmoil behind the scenes, at its launch X promised some\ninteresting possibilities to those brave enough to entrust their financial\nlives to the internet. Following Musk\u2019s preference for using third-party\nsoftware, code, and services wherever possible, X partnered with First Western\nBank and Barclays. This enabled the company to offer a form of checking\naccount at launch, complete with bank cards and checkbooks at Musk\u2019s\ninsistence and\u2014via Barclays\u2014investment fund access.\n\nTo encourage initial sign-ups, the company also tried something genuinely\ninnovative for the sector: rather than investing heavily in advertising and\nmarketing, it started paying customers to sign up. As Musk told CBS\nMarketWatch at the time: \u201cIt's a very clean, simple system. There are no\nminimum balances. You can open an account and receive a $20 promotional offer\nin your checking account. You can move $8 to your S&P fund, $3 each to your\nmoney market and bond fund, and be left with $6 in your checking.\u201d\n\nMusk\u2019s thinking behind this strategy mirrored his approach to financial risk\nmanagement: move fast, drive adoption, and worry about the consequences later.\nFor all the concern this had caused Fricker and the financial teams within X,\nit worked. The company\u2019s employees watched in satisfaction as the number of X\naccount holders began to rapidly grow.\n\nX wasn\u2019t the only fintech startup in Silicon Valley that landed on this growth\nstrategy. Another company\u2014at one point based quite literally across the hall\nfrom X\u2014was already doing the same thing. That company was Confinity.\n\n### The mobile wallet\n\nConfinity was the brainchild of two men: CTO Max Levchin and CEO (and major\ninvestor) Peter Thiel. A Ukrainian who had come to the U.S. to study before\nbeing bitten by the Silicon Valley bug, Levchin was a talented programmer with\nan eye for security. He was fascinated with the growing handheld market, and\nsaw a gap for software that would make security and communications between\ndevices easier.\n\nThiel, meanwhile, was beginning to make a name for himself as a hedge fund\nmanager and investor with an interest in technology. Levchin sought Thiel out,\nand the two men became friends. Levchin pitched a number of his ideas for\nPalmPilots\u2014then the popular hand-held device among business users\u2014at Thiel\nuntil eventually the investor heard one he liked. PalmPilots now came with an\ninfrared port, which could be used to \u201ctalk\u201d to other devices. Why not find a\nway to use that to send money around? Thiel, who had his own philosophical\nobsession with how money worked, saw promise in the idea of mobile wallets\nfull of digital money\u2014and the company that would become Confinity was born.\n\nIn July 1999, Confinity launched its money-sharing service, which it called\nPayPal. Members of the press were invited to a launch party where a\nrepresentative of Nokia Ventures, the mobile company\u2019s investment arm,\n\u201cbeamed\u201d a $4.5 million investment from his own PalmPilot to Thiel\u2019s live on\nstage. A TV producer, whose cameras had failed to capture the moment, asked\nthem to do it again.\n\n\u201cNo! We cannot do it again!\u201d a frustrated Levchin told him from backstage.\n\u201cIt\u2019s millions of dollars moving from one bank to the other.\u201d\n\nMost of the attending press, it turned out, assumed the whole thing had been\nstaged. In reality, Levchin and his team had been working for 36 hours to make\nsure Thiel\u2019s bit of fintech grandstanding would work. Levchin was so tired\nthat he later fell asleep at a table in the middle of the party. The venue\nstaff gently shook him awake in the morning, telling him that everyone had\nleft, but that Thiel had pre-paid for his breakfast.\n\nLike X, Confinity offered a financial incentive for prospective customers: if\nyou signed up, you got $10 added to your mobile wallet. If you then persuaded\na friend to sign up, they got $10, too. It wasn\u2019t long before the number of\naccounts began to grow. Business circles in Silicon Valley became full of\npeople pinging $1 transactions via PalmPilot to colleagues who had yet to\nregister, in an effort to encourage them to sign up.\n\n### The killer app\n\nWhile both X and Confinity fell under the category of financial services,\nneither firm initially saw the other as a direct competitor. Musk was\nruthlessly focused on his goal of making X a one-stop-shop for all things\nfinancial. Confinity wanted to help people move and manage money on their\nhand-held devices. The situation changed, however, when both firms\naccidentally and independently created the same \u201ckiller\u201d app\u2014the ability to\nsend payments from one email address to another.\n\nAt Confinity, the realization that this might be the future began to grow even\nbefore the product\u2019s official launch. For a while, Thiel had been trying to\npersuade David Sacks, an ex-McKinsey consultant and friend, to join the\ncompany. Sacks asked what the product did, and Thiel explained the idea of\n\u201cbeaming\u201d money. Sacks was lukewarm on the idea, believing the growth ceiling\nfor such a product was low. Almost as an aside, Thiel mentioned that Levchin\nhad also built a way for people to send money to another email address via the\nwebsite, in case users had left their PalmPilot at work or home.\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d Sacks said. \u201cThat\u2019s the product.\u201d Intrigued, he joined the company on\nthe condition that Confinity explore this avenue further.\n\nLevchin, focused on PalmPilots, remained unconvinced. So did others at\nConfinity. But in April 1999, a single email triggered a tidal wave of change.\n\nThe email was from a power-seller on a hot startup auction site called eBay.\nThe user explained that eBay did not have a native payment system, so they,\nand other sellers, had begun using PayPal for all their sales. The pay-by-\nemail function made it so easy to transfer money, so to highlight it as an\noption and boost their sales, they wanted to include a PayPal logo on their\nlistings. The image on the PayPal website was too big, though, and they didn\u2019t\nknow how to resize it. Was there any chance Confinity could send them a\nsmaller one?\n\nForwarded by the customer service team to Levchin and the other developers,\nthe email set off a chain of events that revealed just how many eBay users\nwere already using PayPal. To these users, the sign-up offer made adoption of\nthe service a no-brainer. It wasn\u2019t just that transferring money via PayPal\nwas easy. It was the value of the sign-up offer. Most buyers didn\u2019t have a\nPayPal account, while most sellers did. If the seller could persuade the buyer\nto set up an account with their referral link, the buyer would effectively\nsave $10 on their purchase, while the seller would make an additional $10 on\nthe sale.\n\nThis revelation proved Sacks was right. Wasting no time, Thiel and Sacks\npersuaded a reluctant Levchin that they had to fully pivot the product.\nPalmPilots were out. Pay-by-email would be the company\u2019s main focus now.\n\nOver at X, meanwhile, the path to email payments was similar. Musk had\nidentified it as a useful part of his financial nexus, and his developers had\nduly built it. X\u2019s own sign-up offer also meant that once it was available, X,\ntoo, started to benefit from the eBay effect. Unlike the Confinity founders,\nMusk had no desire to pivot his whole company to this new focus. His eyes\nremained ever-fixed on becoming the internet\u2019s financial nexus. But pay-by-\nemail was driving usage in a way no other service in the X family was, and\nMusk recognized that this made it an important part of the company.\n\nIt also made Confinity a rival\u2014one he was determined to beat.\n\n### From enemies to lovers\n\nBoth X and Confinity realized that in order to succeed, their products would\nneed to benefit from the network effect of users around a de facto standard.\nDominating the market early was critical.\n\nOver the next few months, in a cut-throat quest to achieve supremacy, a\nvicious rivalry developed between the two companies. They became locked in a\nspending spree in a desperate effort to continue high levels of growth. X\nincreased its signup offer; Confinity responded the same way. While both\ncompanies\u2019 user numbers climbed, every one of those customers was costing\nthem\u2014or rather, their investors\u2014money.\n\nBoth companies struggled to find a way to make their services generate\nrevenue. For X, few users showed much interest in accessing its other\nfinancial services, which was how Musk intended to make a profit. The story\nwas no better at Confinity. Thiel\u2019s assumption had been that users would leave\nmoney in their PayPal accounts, allowing Confinity to make money through\ninterest on deposits it held on behalf of its users. This was one of the key\nreasons the company didn\u2019t charge a fee on money transfers. But the amount of\nmoney users were leaving in their PayPal wallets remained worryingly low.\n\nAs the year 2000 approached, the financial burn rate at both X and Confinity\ngrew dangerously. Musk didn\u2019t see a problem with this. He wanted to win. He\nknew X had deeper pockets than Confinity, so its financial runway was longer.\nBesides, if he wanted more money he\u2019d just go back to the market\u2014indeed, in\nearly 2000 X had already begun the process of kicking off another funding\nround.\n\nUnfortunately for Musk, he was no longer the sole power behind X. In the quest\nfor funding, X had acquired additional backers and investors during previous\nrounds that he needed to answer to\u2014most notably, Mike Moritz of Sequoia\nCapital.\n\nWhen Moritz brought Sequoia onboard, it was with one stipulation\u2014that Musk\nstep back from the role of CEO. Musk could still drive product strategy,\nMoritz said, but the company was growing, and it needed an experienced hand on\nthe tiller\u2014especially because there were rumors among investors that X had a\nculture of coding first, and worrying about regulators and risk later. Moritz\nwarned Musk that a calm and trusted figure at the top would likely be required\nto attract further investment.\n\nKeen to focus on his grand plan and the technology required to achieve it,\nMusk saw no harm in Moritz\u2019s proposal. He was still the majority owner of the\ncompany, so he felt confident that a new CEO posed no risk to his control.\n\nMusk stepped back from the role of CEO at the end of 1999. In came Bill\nHarris, a well-respected financial veteran from Intuit. Almost immediately,\nthe value of the appointment became clear. In January 2000 news broke about a\nsecurity flaw in X that allowed fraudsters to transfer money from anyone\u2019s\naccount with just basic account information. The bug had already been fixed by\nthe time it became public, just as X was trying to complete another funding\nround. Moritz was right: had Harris not been CEO, many of the investors X was\ncourting would have walked away. Musk was relieved and pleased. He would not\nremain that way for long.\n\n### \u2018A gun to my head\u2019\n\nAs the new millennium dawned and Musk was working to raise new funds at X,\nThiel was busy imparting some hard truths to Levchin. It was Thiel\u2019s firm\nbelief that though Confinity had the better product and greater market share,\nthey were going to lose the war with X. Thiel\u2019s reasoning was simple: they\nwere going to run out of money first.\n\nLooking at the markets, Thiel realized that a tech crash was coming\u2014which\nwould prove to be correct. He was sure that Confinity, like X, could complete\nanother funding round, but he predicted it would be the last major investment\nboth companies would see for a while. They would need to create enough runway\nnot only to allow them to outspend X but also to survive. If both companies\nstayed at war, Thiel argued, mutually assured destruction would be the only\noutcome.\n\nWith Levchin\u2019s reluctant support, Thiel reached out to X to float the idea of\na merger. Given the hatred the two companies had built up for each other, he\ndid not expect a response. To his surprise, he found himself talking to\nsomeone who agreed with him: Bill Harris. Harris, too, was desperately worried\nabout the unsustainability of X\u2019s burn rate. He reached a similar conclusion\nas Thiel: the two companies were killing each other. Yes, X could likely\noutlast its rival, but not without fatally wounding itself.\n\nThe two men met and reached an agreement: X and Confinity needed to merge.\n\nWhen Musk was told the news, his reaction bordered on the explosive. He did\nrecognize, however, the validity of the arguments being made. He agreed to let\nnegotiations take place, although he insisted on opening with an offer that\nwould see a 92/8 stock split in X\u2019s favor. When Harris and Musk met Thiel and\nLevchin to present this, Levchin was so angry that he stood up and left. Away\nfrom the table, he told Thiel to call the whole thing off. Thiel told him to\ncalm down. Time and investor pressure, Thiel insisted, was on their side. All\nthey had to do was wait, and X would be back with better terms.\n\nThiel was right. By the end of February 2000, the two sides were looking at a\n55/45 merger. Levchin was still unhappy but told Thiel that he would\nreluctantly accept it. That was the case until, on a visit to X\u2019s offices,\nMusk told Levchin that Confinity was getting \u201ca f**king deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy blood just boiled, and so I thought, it\u2019s off,\u201d Levchin remembered later.\nIt took some frantic damage control on the part of Harris and Thiel to get\nLevchin back on board with the idea. Musk\u2019s contempt would also cost X another\nfive points on the split. Levchin only agreed to sign off if the split was\namended to 50/50.\n\nMusk, meanwhile, was now adamant he wouldn\u2019t sign off on the merger at all.\nHis dream was to build a global financial nexus. That wasn\u2019t Confinity\u2019s\ndream, and he didn\u2019t need its PayPal product to do it. Nor did he feel like\nConfinity was anywhere close to X\u2019s equal in value. He\u2019d felt a 92/8 split was\ngenerous. The idea of a 50/50 one was laughable.\n\nMusk has never hid his contempt for the merger, talking openly about his\ndesire not to see it completed. \u201cI was like, f**k you. We\u2019re just going to\nkill them,\u201d Musk said in an interview about his attitude after Harris\nconfirmed the new terms.\n\nMusk was confident that this was the end of the discussion. He held the\ncontrolling interest in X, after all. What he hadn\u2019t counted on was Harris\u2019s\ndetermination to push it through.\n\nThe company\u2019s current funding round depended on the confidence attached to the\npresence of Bill Harris, and Harris knew it. So Harris went to Musk and told\nhim to sign off on the merger, or Harris would quit. Musk was furious but knew\nthe damage Harris\u2019s resignation would do at that time.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re basically putting a gun to my head,\u201d Musk later remembered telling\nHarris.\n\nIt worked. In March 2000, X and Confinity merged, with Harris as CEO of the\nnew firm, which kept the X name.\n\n### Musk takes the reigns again\n\nHarris\u2019s reign as CEO over the newly-merged company was short-lived. Within\nfive months, he was out. Levchin, Thiel, and Musk were all strong\npersonalities, but they shared a belief in the power of paying the customer to\nsign up. When Harris tried to put an end to this tactic in an attempt to\nreduce the amount of money the company was hemorrhaging each month, Thiel\nvehemently disagreed. A rift formed between the two men.\n\nMusk had never forgiven Harris for forcing the merger and spotted an\nopportunity to act. There were six members on the new company\u2019s board:\nfounders Musk, Thiel, and Levchin; and Moritz, John Malloy, and Tim Hurd, who\nrepresented major investors. Knowing Thiel would likely break his way in a\nvote, Musk enlisted Levchin\u2019s help to stage a coup. They gathered signatures\nfrom the development team on a letter of mass resignation and presented it to\nthe other board members at an emergency meeting. If Harris didn\u2019t resign, Musk\nsaid, then both he and Levchin would walk, and so would most of the\ndevelopment team.\n\nThe ultimatum worked. Harris was forced to resign, and in May 2000 Musk took\nover again as CEO, with Levchin becoming CTO.\n\nFor Musk, this represented the summit of his power at X. He believed it\npresented an opportunity to refocus the company on his plan to create a global\none-stop-shop for financial services, of which pay-by-email was just one small\npart. Yes, the company was still burning money, but he didn\u2019t believe that he\nshould have to compromise his vision. To save money and help attract new\ninvestors, the company needed to streamline its development processes, use\nmore third-party services, and focus on converting PayPal users to X\u2019s other\nservices.\n\n### The PayPal V2 disaster\n\nMusk\u2019s new-found alliance with Levchin barely lasted a month. Before the\nmerger, Confinity and X had pursued approaches to code and infrastructure that\nwere polar opposites. Musk set X up as a Microsoft house, buying and using\noff-the-shelf products and frameworks to ship quickly and keep his development\nteam small. In contrast, Levchin believed that while it required a lot more\npeople and effort, open-source software and Linux was the way to go. It\nallowed PayPal to scale and adapt better.\n\nOver the objections of Levchin, Musk ordered that all new feature development\non PayPal must stop. Instead, the developers should focus on creating \u201cPayPal\nV2\u201d: a complete rebuild, from the ground up, using Microsoft products and\nservices.\n\nThis decision alienated Levchin and the ex-Confinity developers, who felt that\nit unnecessarily discarded the Confinity codebase for the sake of conforming\nto Musk\u2019s preferences. The longer the project continued, the clearer it also\nbecame that Microsoft had over-promised about what its products could do at\nthe time. Multiple major issues, including serious memory leaks, emerged\nduring testing. V2 simply couldn\u2019t operate at the level required to run\nPayPal. It was also taking far longer to rewrite the codebase than Musk had\nanticipated.\n\nThe deadline for implementing PayPal V2 and unfreezing product improvement and\ndevelopment came and went. In an effort to speed things up, Musk offered bonus\nbounties if key milestones were met. He should have taken it as a ominous sign\nthat, despite their efforts, the development teams couldn\u2019t meet them.\nNonetheless, Musk doubled down on his plan over Levchin\u2019s objections. He set a\nhard deadline at which point PayPal V2 would be rolled out, ready or not. He\nalso decreed that no provision for rollback to the Linux version was to be\nmade. Once live, it would stay live\u2014whether it worked or not.\n\n### Laser-focused on the grand plan\n\nIn addition to alienating many on the development team, Musk had no intention\nof letting them focus on the pay-by-email market\u2014or, indeed, of letting PayPal\nbe PayPal. The goal was to create a global financial nexus, so PayPal needed\nto be subsumed and used to drive the uptake of X\u2019s other financial services.\nThat was the sole value he saw in the company.\n\nTo this end, Musk ordered that the paypal.com URL be redirected to x.com and a\nfull rebrand of PayPal begin. The overhaul included the replacing of PayPal\u2019s\nname with X-PayPal and its logos.\n\nThese decisions horrified many on the product and marketing teams, including\nhead of payments Reid Hoffman. They had all become critically aware of what\ntheir eBay users\u2014on whom their perceived path to profit almost entirely\ndepended\u2014wanted, and it wasn\u2019t X.\n\nPayPal strategy analyst Vivien Go\u2014who had led a branding survey with\nusers\u2014recalled just how badly X tested whenever focus groups were run. \"Again\nand again, the theme of 'Oh God, I wouldn't trust this website,\u201d she told\nJimmy Soni in an interview for his book Founders. \u201c\u2018It's an adult website' and\n'I just wouldn't trust that.\u2019\"\n\nMusk ignored the focus group evidence and insisted that they push ahead with\nthe changes.\n\n### Running out of runway\n\nThe issues with the development, product, and marketing teams were not enough\nto topple Musk from power on their own. Perhaps ironically, it was the other\nfinancial services he was so keen to push that played the final part in his\ndownfall.\n\nFrom its launch, Musk insisted on a culture of growth over verification for\nX\u2019s financial services. While this ensured rapid adoption, it meant that\nminimal checks were being made on fake sign-ups and fraud. Once it became\nclear that an X account could be opened easily\u2014granting access to debit cards,\ncheck books, and credit\u2014fraud became a serious issue.\n\nKen Miller, who had been brought in to try and help with fraud issues, later\nrecalled some of X\u2019s major problems. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Oh cool. First Name: Mick.\nMiddle initial: E. Last name: Mouse. Perfect. Oh, and they sent a transaction\nfor $2,700. Perfect,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we gave them a line of credit.\u201d\n\nThese issues weren\u2019t entirely unknown to Confinity pre-merger, but the scale\nwas greater than many had realized. Fraud was also increasing, not decreasing,\nas Musk rejected almost every effort to deal with it that would have harmed\ngrowth.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, X\u2019s financial wizard and until then a Musk loyalist,\nRoelof Botha, discovered that X\u2019s exposure\u2014and likely losses\u2014were even greater\nthan previously thought. Under pressure, Musk had agreed to sunset a number of\nproducts in the X range that extended credit to high-risk accounts. The value\nof the interest on that credit was likely non-existent, as was the chance of\never receiving repayment. Yet Botha realized that both were still being\ncounted as income on which X could rely in the coming months.\n\nBotha took the numbers to Thiel, who was already concerned about the company\u2019s\nfinances. X was burning over $12 million a month and had less than $70 million\nleft in the bank. Its ability to raise further funding was shrinking. A\npotentially disastrous PayPal V2 rollout, combined with this growing risk\nexposure, might make it impossible. Thiel decided it was time to act.\n\n### The Confinity coup\n\nJust who was responsible for making the first move in what became known as the\n\u201cConfinity coup\u201d remains up for debate. In most accounts, it was Thiel.\nCertainly, once it was underway, it was Thiel who ensured it succeeded. Eric\nM. Jackson, however, who was working at X at that time, claims in his book The\nPayPal Wars that it was Levchin who made the first move, sounding out Sacks\nand others before going to Thiel for support.\n\nThat its origins are so unclear highlights how many of the key figures within\nthe company Musk had managed to alienate in his brief time in charge. That so\nmany were involved shows how concerned over the future of the company they had\nbecome.\n\nWhatever its origins, in early September 2000, a plot to overthrow Musk began\nto coalesce. The core group of plotters included Thiel, Levchin, Sacks, and,\ncritically, both Botha and Hoffman. In a dark twist, they realized that their\nbest chance of success was to follow the same strategy that Musk himself had\nused against Harris. They quietly canvassed the ex-Confinity developers and\nstaff thought to be loyal to Levchin, as well as any X staff known to feel\nthat Musk\u2019s grand plan was about to bring the company down. Those staffers\nwere then asked to sign a letter of mass resignation.\n\nThe issue, the plotters knew, would be winning a vote against Musk on the\nboard. Thiel and Levchin had votes, but so did Musk, so success was entirely\ndependent on their ability to convince the others to vote with Thiel and\nLevchin, not Musk. John Malloy, a Confinity backer pre-merger, was known to be\nsympathetic, and he was warned about the plot. While he didn\u2019t offer his\nexplicit support, he didn\u2019t alert Musk either, leading the plotters to believe\nhe would vote their way.\n\nThis made Mike Moritz the critical board member. If Moritz sided with Musk,\nHurd would, too, and that might convince Malloy to vote that way as well.\nMoritz had to be convinced to vote their way, and he had to be convinced while\nMusk, with whom Moritz had a positive relationship, wasn\u2019t around to spin the\nproblems the company was facing. Ideally Musk needed to be kept away from the\nother board members as well.\n\nThe plotters realized there was only one day on which their coup would work:\nSeptember 19. On that day, Musk was due to embark on his delayed honeymoon\nwith his new wife, Justine Wilson. They would be flying to Sydney, Australia\nto watch the Olympics. In the days before accessible in-air wi-fi, calls, and\nmessaging, the plotters would have a brief window to act in which Musk would\nnot only be unable to find out what was happening, but also to intervene. It\nwould also grant them precious hours to work the other board members without\nMusk interfering.\n\n### The fall of Musk\n\nOn September 19, 2000, Elon and Justine boarded a flight to Sydney. Once the\nplane was in the air, the coup began. Thiel and the other plotters went to\nSequoia\u2019s offices and cornered Moritz, presenting him with the issues and\nsecuring his reluctant support. Thiel then called Hurd and requested an\nemergency board meeting over a conference call.\n\nIn that meeting, Levchin and Thiel laid out, in detail, all of the problems\nwith PayPal V2, the brand changes, and the financial risks facing the firm.\nFor Moritz, Malloy, and Hurd, arguably much of this was new information. They\nwere not only horrified at the emerging state of the company, but also that\nMusk had ordered many of these decisions\u2014such as the PayPal V2 code\nrewrite\u2014without clearing it with the board. With no Musk on the call to offer\na defense, the board was left to listen to the plotters\u2019 take on the\nsituation. Before the call ended, they were presented with the plotters\u2019 trump\ncard\u2014the letter of mass resignation.\n\nMeanwhile in Sydney, Musk was alerted to the ongoing coup by a loyalist.\nAccording to Jackson, they were lurking outside the conference room in which\nthe plotters had first gathered and sent Musk an email. Now aware of what was\nhappening back home, Musk spoke to the board by phone. None of these issues,\nhe argued, were important or mattered. Nor, at the end of the day, did PayPal.\nX had always been about more than just pay-by-email, he insisted. This was all\nnecessary to achieve his grand plan and create a global financial nexus. Musk\ninsisted that if the board held its nerve, they could achieve so much more\nthan simply dominating the pay-by-email market.\n\nMusk was notoriously charismatic when selling investors on his dreams, but\nThiel picked the timing of the coup well. Perhaps if his appeals had been in\nperson, Musk could have swayed Moritz and the others back to his side. The\nfull board conducted more conference calls, with Thiel and Levchin nervously\nreporting progress to the other plotters by relay in the room next door. Musk\nhimself likely soon realized that the only way to save himself at this point\nwas to get to the others, in person, before a final decision was made. He\nquickly booked and boarded a flight back to the U.S.\n\nIt was too late. By the time Musk landed, the decision had already been made.\nHe would be forced to resign, to be replaced by Thiel as interim (and soon\npermanent) CEO. Nor would there be a CTO role for him to fall back on this\ntime\u2014Levchin retained that. Musk was reduced to a directorship and a seat on\nthe board.\n\nFor Musk, robbed of X as both a company and a dream, that was never going to\nbe enough. The decision all but confirmed his departure from X soon\nthereafter.\n\n### The deed is done\n\n\u201cSneaky backstabbing bastards\u201d is how Musk described the plotters in hindsight\nto Soni, albeit with more than a hint of sanguine humor. At the time, to\nMusk\u2019s credit, he recognized that going down with a fight would only bring the\ncompany (and his investment) down with him. Thiel pivoted the company to focus\nentirely on PayPal, discontinue X\u2019s financial services, and address fraud.\nX\u2014or rather, PayPal, as the company was soon renamed\u2014became a huge success.\nIts sale, for $1.5 billion to eBay in 2002, granted Musk as a shareholder a\nfar larger payday than he earned for Zip2, jump-starting many of his other\nventures. Musk and Thiel would work together again, with Thiel as one of\nSpaceX\u2019s initial backers, and Musk has always acknowledged that, financially,\nPayPal\u2019s pivot was a win.\n\nNoticeably absent in any of the interviews in which Musk talks about his\ndeparture from X, however, is any acceptance that his grand plan wouldn\u2019t have\nworked. Lurking at the end of his sentences is always a verbal ellipsis: the\nsuggestion that if the plotters had trusted him, the rewards would have been\neven greater, and they would have built a financial nexus that would now\ndominate the digital world.\n\n### A future for Twitter\n\nMusk\u2019s fall from power at X is what makes his pivot of Twitter so interesting.\nThat this is a pivot, rather than the grand plan for Twitter all along, is the\nmore likely reality. Musk\u2019s various attempts to make Twitter profitable\nthrough changes that have aggravated users and advertisers, and resulted in\nthousands of sweeping job cuts, are not what you would do if your vision from\nthe beginning is to build a one-stop-shop for anything, let alone finance. If\nthat were the goal, then purchasing a company like SoFi rather than Twitter\nwould have been a smarter starting point.\n\nAll-in-one service platforms require something to persuade people to stick\nbecause they need to compete with specialist platforms offering more tailored\nservices. WeChat achieved its dominance in part because the Chinese state\ndesired it to be so. Musk doesn\u2019t have that luxury. Whatever he develops will\nhave to rely on trust to create stickiness, and on that front Musk\u2019s own\nactions have left Twitter on the verge of the point of no return\u2014potentially\nbreaching the trust thermocline\u2014for some time, if it hasn\u2019t already.\n\nMusk\u2019s actions at Twitter are, at least in part, an attempt to rewrite the way\nthe X and Confinity merger ended. Musk has spotted an opportunity to finally\nconquer the \u201cwhat if\u201d that has taunted him. This time he likely feels that\nthere are no pesky investors that can stop him, and he is probably correct.\n\nHis success this time will depend on two things: whether there is any appeal\nfor an all-encompassing app in the West and, if so, whether there are enough\npeople prepared to accept Musk as the force behind it, given his polarizing\neffect on public opinion and Twitter as a platform.\n\nWhat is clear is that Musk has begun the hunt for his great white whale once\nagain. Whether it will succeed\u2014or turn into a great white fail whale\u2014remains\nto be seen.\n\nGareth Edwards is a digital strategist who has worked for startups and\ncorporations in both the UK and U.S., helping them develop digital brands and\nproducts.

As someone who is familiar with WeChat, I think people\ndon't realize just how deep the security runs and how much integration there\nis with the Chinese state. Absolute security, granted by the state is a large\npart why Chinese citizens are confident putting entire paychecks and buying\nhouses through WeChat. Given Elon's previous patterns of disregarding\nsecurity, I'm doubtful of whether he can achieve the same level of trust\n\n\u2661 1 \u00b7 Reply\n\nGeorgia Patrick 9 months ago\n\nI admire writers who do a thorough job of research and then make the story\ninteresting.
