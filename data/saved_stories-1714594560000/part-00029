At this point, no one has any idea what\nCEO Elon Musk was thinking or what\u2019s going to happen going forward. Including\nother automakers that recently switched to NACS. Maybe Musk is just looking to\nget out of the charging game? If that\u2019s the case, then it must be a recent\ndevelopment because, as Politico reports, Tesla is also the single biggest\nbenefactor of federal EV charging grants from the Bipartisan Infrastructure\nLaw.\n\n#### Related Content\n\nAn Elon Musk-Controlled Charging Network Imperils The EV Revolution\n\nElon Musk Says He Still Wants To Grow Supercharger Network After Laying Off\nSupercharger Network Team\n\nTesla Had A Very Interesting Week\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nview video\n\nTesla Had A Very Interesting Week\n\nOut of all the EV charging grants that have been handed out so far, Tesla\nreportedly won almost 13 percent of them, totaling more than $17 million.\nConsidering that the Tesla Supercharger network is currently the best network\nin the country, that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. And with the deals Tesla\nstruck to allow non-Teslas to use Superchargers, we\u2019re almost surprised that\nfigure isn\u2019t higher. There are plenty of things that Tesla does wrong, but its\ncharging network definitely isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nAn Elon Musk-Controlled Charging Network Imperils The EV Revolution\n\nElon Musk Says He Still Wants To Grow Supercharger Network After Laying Off\nSupercharger Network Team\n\nTesla Had A Very Interesting Week\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nTesla Had A Very Interesting Week\n\nThen again, perhaps Tesla wasn\u2019t awarded more grants to avoid making it look\nlike the federal government is lining Tesla\u2019s pockets or creating a state-\nfunded monopoly. As Politico points out, 13 percent of all grants awarded is\nunlikely to prompt any antitrust claims.\n\nTesla doesn\u2019t just have an advantage because of the network it\u2019s already\nbuilt, either. In addition to proposing larger charging hubs than much of its\ncompetition, Tesla also builds them for a lot less money. That $17 million\nthat it was awarded was for 41 charging stations, whereas Oklahoma-based\nFrancis Energy reportedly needed $30.4 million to build 37 stations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe irony, of course, is that while Tesla is more than happy to take the\nfederal government\u2019s money, its CEO has spent months tweeting about how Biden\nis ruining the country, calling him \u201ca damp [sock] puppet in human form\u201d while\nalso actively engaged in carrying out the Great Replacement Theory, an\nincredibly racist far-right conspiracy that claims immigrants are going to\nwipe out the white race.\n\nIf Musk had any principles, you\u2019d think he would have refused the damp sock\npuppet\u2019s money, but we all know Musk doesn\u2019t have any principles beyond doing\nwhat he wants at any given moment. More importantly, though, it makes Musk\u2019s\ndecision to fire the entire Supercharger team even more confusing. Tesla was\nin an incredible position to keep being awarded more grants, clearly had\ninterest in continuing to build out the Supercharger network, and now, just,\nwhat? Gave up?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe Musk plans to hire a brand new Supercharger team. Maybe Tesla just plans\nto let the Superchargers go to fallow. Maybe there\u2019s something we\u2019re missing\nhere, but if you\u2019re confused, just know you\u2019re far from the only one.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
