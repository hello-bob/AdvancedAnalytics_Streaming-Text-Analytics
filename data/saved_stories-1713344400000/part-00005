Now a specialist\nsoftware package is set to change the way physicists model Star Trek-like\ntravel.\n\nThe Physics arXiv Blog\n\nBy The Physics arXiv Blog\n\nApr 16, 2024 8:00 PMApr 16, 2024 7:00 PM\n\n(Credit: Willrow Hood/Shutterstock)\n\n## Newsletter\n\nSign up for our email newsletter for the latest science news\n\n\u201cWarp speed, Mr. Sulu!\u201d With these words, Captain Kirk of the Starship\nEnterprise prepared his ship for faster-than-light travel while inspiring a\ngeneration of aspiring physicists who watched Star Trek from their sofas.\n\nSo it\u2019s no surprise that in 1994, the theoretical physicist, Miguel\nAlcubierre, worked out how a warp drive might work in the real universe. The\nkey feature of a warp drive is that it can propel a spaceship at superluminal\nspeeds without the occupants experiencing huge acceleration.\n\nAlcubierre\u2019s idea was to create a flat region of spacetime inside a highly\ndistorted bubble of spacetime that moves across the universe. The passengers\nsit in the flat region where the acceleration is zero, while the bubble as a\nwhole, travels at superluminal speed, or at least exceedingly high velocity.\n\nThe big question, of course, was whether the Alcubierre drive was physically\npossible. The answer turned out to be probably not, because it required\nnegative energy, which is not allowed by our current understanding of physics,\nand unfeasibly large energy densities.\n\n## Bubble Physics\n\nNevertheless, Alcubierre\u2019s work inspired others to look for alternative warp\ndrives that might be physically possible. In 2021, physicists worked out how\nto make a warp drive using positive energy, although with unfeasibly high\nenergy density. Indeed, there is a whole class of warp drives.\n\nBut evaluating these models is hard because of the fiendishly difficult\nmathematics behind them. The mathematics involves two stages.\n\nHaving come up with a structure for spacetime that might allow warp speed, the\nfirst is to solve Einstein\u2019s field equations to determine the flux of energy\nand momentum. This flux is given by mathematical entities called stress-energy\ntensors.\n\nOnce these have been found, the second stage is to work out whether the\nstress-energy tensors are physically realistic. In other words, whether they\nviolate the laws of physics or require impractical resources, like infinite\nenergy density.\n\nThese calculations are so complex that physicists often revert to simple\nsolutions that make the equations involved more manageable, such as assuming\nspherical symmetry. However, this inevitably ignores potentially interesting\nspacetimes with more complex geometries.\n\nNow Christopher Helmerich at the University of Alabama in Huntsville and\ncolleagues have developed a software package called Warp Factory, that takes\non the mathematical heavy lifting. \u201cWarp Factory is a specialized toolkit\ndesigned for analyzing spacetimes related to warp drives,\u201d say Helmerich and\nco.\n\nThey put it through its paces by characterizing the stress-energy tensors of a\nrange of known warp drive geometries, such as Alcubierre\u2019s, and evaluating\ntheir physical plausibility.\n\nNone of these models are close to being anything other than mathematical\ncuriosities but the Warp Factory provides new ways to understand them and\nleads to new insights into their nature. In particular, it allows physicists\nto study subluminal warp drives in more detail, which may turn out to be the\nones of most interest.\n\n\u201cThis comprehensive toolkit provides insightful visualizations in both 2D and\n3D, offering a deeper understanding of metrics and their corresponding stress-\nenergy tensors,\u201d say Helmerich and co.\n\n## Factory Download\n\nThe team have made the Warp Factory available for download so anybody can\nstudy their design for a revolutionary warp drive. That\u2019s no guarantee that\nphysically plausible warp drives will emerge. But it provides a tool that will\nsurely kickstart research in this area. \u201cWe aim to further warp drive research\nand hopefully bring us closer to realizing physically achievable warp drives,\u201d\nsay the researchers.\n\nSo don\u2019t be surprised if more plausible warp drives emerge in the coming weeks\nand months. Indeed, Helmerich and co hint at as much in their paper. \u201cIn a\nseparate paper, currently in preparation, a new constant velocity warp drive\nsolution has been found without energy condition violations,\u201d they say. Just\nhow physically plausible this will be, is not yet clear.\n\nNevertheless, Mr. Sulu would surely be impressed.\n\nRef: Analyzing Warp Drive Spacetimes with Warp Factory :\narxiv.org/abs/2404.03095\n\n  * spacecraft\n\n1 free article left\n\nWant More?
