It says kebabs are already\n\u20ac10 (\u00a38.60) in some cities, rising from \u20ac4 just two years ago.\n\nThe party recommends a \u20ac4.9o price cap, and \u20ac2.90 for young people, especially\nthose from lower income backgrounds, for whom it argues the dish \u2013 thinly\nsliced grilled meat topped with finely chopped vegetables, garlic or chilli\nsauce, and cradled in a folded flatbread \u2013 is a daily staple. It suggests\nevery household could receive daily doner vouchers.\n\nSales of kebabs \u2013 introduced to Germany by Turkish immigrants, who adapted it\nfor local tastes \u2013 total an estimated \u20ac7bn a year in Germany.\n\nBased on the estimated 1.3bn doners that are consumed in the country each year\n\u2013 400,000 a day in Berlin alone \u2013 such a subsidy programme would cost \u20ac4bn\nannually, Die Linke has calculated.\n\nHanna Steinm\u00fcller, an MP for the Greens, a party that more usually appeals to\npeople to give up meat, addressed the issue in parliament earlier this year.\n\u201cFor young people right now it is an issue as important as where they will\nmove when they leave home. I know it\u2019s not an everyday issue for many people\nhere,\u201d she said to fellow MPs, \u201cand that ... it\u2019s also something that might be\nridiculed, but I think as voter representatives we are obliged to highlight\nthese different perspectives\u201d.\n\nScholz \u2013 approached at one event by a young German Turk who said \u201cI pay \u20ac8 ...\nspeak to Putin, I want to pay \u20ac4\u201d \u2013 has ruled out price controls as \u201cnot\nimplementable\u201d in a free market economy. He has instead praised the \u201cgood work\nof the European Central Bank\u201d in bringing inflation down.\n\nAmong the responses on social media, some young people have called for the\nreturn of Angela Merkel, arguing that as chancellor, Scholz\u2019s predecessor \u201chad\nthe doner under control\u201d.\n\nDeniz, a doner seller at a kiosk near Berlin\u2019s Friedrichstrasse station, where\nthe cost has risen from \u20ac3.90 to \u20ac7 in just more than two years, said he could\nnot see how the price would come down any time soon. \u201cWe have been forced to\npush up the price, due to exploding rent, energy and food prices,\u201d he said.\n\u201cPeople talk to us all the time about \u2018D\u00f6nerflation\u2019, as if we were diddling\nthem, but it\u2019s completely out of our control.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Germany\n  * Food\n  * Inflation\n  * Olaf Scholz\n  * Europe\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Teenager turns himself in to police after attack on German lawmaker\n\n2d ago\n\n  * ### Sunak hopes of pre-election interest rate cuts frustrated by inflation slow puncture\n\n17 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Germany vows to fight violence against politicians after MEP seriously hurt\n\n3d ago\n\n  * ### Bank of England governor shrugs off smaller-than-expected fall in inflation\n\n17 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Food inflation in world\u2019s rich nations falls to pre-Ukraine war levels\n\n8 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### How climate policies are becoming focus for far-right attacks in Germany\n\n7d ago\n\n  * ### \u2018The Greens are our enemy\u2019: What is fuelling the far right in Germany?\n\n7d ago\n\n  * ### Vinyl records return to UK inflation basket for first time since 1992\n\n11 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Bank of England governor dampens hopes of interest rate cut\n\n14 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Alleged far-right plotters on trial in Germany accused of plan to overthrow state\n\n29 Apr 2024\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
