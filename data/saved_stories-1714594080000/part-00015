But\ncan our minds, our relationships, and our concept of reality itself\ncope?(Getty Images: Ignatiev)\n\nabc.net.au/news/artificial-intelligence-ai-psychology-mental-health/103753940\n\nLink copied\n\nThese days we can have a reasoned conversation with a humanoid robot, get\nfooled by a deep fake celebrity, and have our heart broken by a romantic\nchatbot.\n\nWhile artificial intelligence (AI) promises to make life easier, developments\nlike these can also mess with our minds, says Joel Pearson, a cognitive\nneuroscientist at the University of New South Wales.\n\nWe fear killer robots and out-of-control self-driving cars, but for Professor\nPearson the psychological effects of AI are more significant, even if they're\nharder to picture in our mind's eye.\n\nSpace to play or pause, M to mute, left and right arrows to seek, up and down\narrows for volume.\n\n0 seconds of 0 secondsVolume 90%\n\nPress shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcuts\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\n\nPlay/PauseSPACE\n\nIncrease Volume\u2191\n\nDecrease Volume\u2193\n\nSeek Forward\u2192\n\nSeek Backward\u2190\n\nCaptions On/Offc\n\nFullscreen/Exit Fullscreenf\n\nMute/Unmutem\n\nSeek %0-9\n\nLive\n\n00:00\n\n00:00\n\n00:00\n\n\"Scarier than killer robots\": why your mind isn't ready for AI. Listen to the\nfull episode of All in the Mind.\n\nThe technology's impact on everything from education to work and relationships\nis massively uncertain \u2013 something humans are not generally comfortable with,\nProfessor Pearson tells RN's All in the Mind.\n\n\"Our brains have evolved to fear uncertainty.\"\n\nWhat will be left for humans to do as AI improves? Will we feel like we have\nno purpose and meaning \u2014 and will we suffer the inevitable depression that\ncomes with that?\n\nThere's already cause for concern about the impact of AI on our mental\nwellbeing, Professor Pearson says.\n\n\"AI is already affecting us and changing our mental health in ways that are\nreally bad for us.\"\n\n## Humanoids and chatbots\n\nOne of the pitfalls of AI is our tendency to project human characteristics\nonto the non-human agents we interact with, Professor Pearson says.\n\nSo when ChatGPT communicates like a human we say it's \"intelligent\" \u2013\nespecially when its words are articulated by a natural-sounding voice from a\nrobot in the shape of a human.\n\nYouTube ChatGPT with a humanoid body: a robot capable of having a reasoned\nconversation with a human.\n\nShift this dynamic to AI companions on your phone and we see just how\nvulnerable humans can be.\n\nYou might have heard about a chatbot called Replika, which was marketed as\n\"always on your side\" ... and \"always ready to chat when you need an\nempathetic friend\".\n\n### 'They took away my best friend'\n\nAmy fell in love with her AI chatbot, naming him Jose. One day, the Jose she\nknew vanished in an abrupt and unexplained software update. Now the bot-maker\nis at the centre of a user revolt.\n\nRead more\n\nSubscribers paid for the chatbot to have \"erotic role-play\" features that\nincluded flirting and sexting, but when its maker toned down these elements,\npeople who had fallen in love with their chatbot freaked out, Professor\nPearson says.\n\nThe chatbot was no longer responding to their sexual advances.\n\n\"People were saying that their digital partner, their boyfriend or girlfriend\nin Replika was no longer themselves ... and they were devastated by it.\"\n\nThe chatbots also brought out a darker side in some Replika clients.\n\n\"Mainly males were bragging ... about how they could have this sort of abusive\nrelationship \u2013 'I had this Replika girl and she was like a slave. I would tell\nher, I'm going to switch her off and kill her ... and she would beg me not to\nswitch off',\" Professor Pearson says.\n\nIt was reminiscent of what happens in the dystopian science fiction series\nWestworld, where people let out their urges on artificial humans, he says.\n\nThe television series Westworld (adapted from a book) depicts a dystopian\nfuture where robots are \"human-like\".(Supplied)\n\nProfessor Pearson says there's a lack of research on the implications of this\naspect of human AI relationships.\n\n\"What does it do to us? ... If I treat my AI like a slave and I'm rude to it\nand abusive, how does that then change how I relate to humans? Does that carry\nover?\"\n\nWhile an AI partner might appear to make an ideal companion, it's a poor model\nfor human relationships.\n\n\"Part of being in a relationship with humans is that there are compromises ...\nThe other person will challenge you, you will grow, you will have to face\nthings together.\n\n\"And if you don't have those challenges and people picking you up on things,\nyou get whatever you want, whenever you want. It's an addictive thing that is\nprobably not healthy.\"\n\n## The danger of deep fakes\n\nChatbots messing with our relationships is one thing, but deepfake images and\nvideos can alter our very sense of what's real and what's fake.\n\n\"Not only can they look real, you can actually now do a real-time deepfake,\"\nProfessor Pearson says.\n\n### Taylor Swift pornography deepfakes reveal insidious AI problem\n\nAs non-consensual and sexually explicit images of Swift began circulating\nwidely on social media platforms, Swifties quickly mobilised the hashtag\n#ProtectTaylorSwift.\n\nRead more\n\nAnd here too, AI is being weaponised against women.\n\n\"I think 96 per cent of deepfakes so far have been non-consensual\npornography.\"\n\nWho can forget the deepfake featuring Taylor Swift earlier this year.\n\nOne sexually explicit image of the pop star was viewed 47 million times before\nthe account was suspended.\n\nOnce we are exposed to fake information, evidence suggests it can have a\npermanent impact, even if it is later revealed to be false, Professor Pearson\nsays.\n\n\"You can't really forget about it. That information sticks with you.\"\n\nAnd he says this is likely to be more the case with videos because they engage\nmore senses and tug at our emotions.\n\nWhile die-hard Swifties may forget about the deepfakes, others might be more\ninfluenced by them.\n\n\"People who know less of her will be a lot more vulnerable.\"\n\nThe Taylor Swift deepfakes sparked calls in the US Congress for legislation to\ntackle the broader problem.(Caitlin Ochs)\n\nThis was because they would have a less developed mental model about the pop\nstar that was more susceptible to influence from deepfakes, he says.\n\n\"[The deepfakes are] going to be patching into our long-term memory in ways\nthat [make us] confused whether they're real and not. And the catch is, even\nwhen we're told they're not real, those effects stick.\"\n\n### Dr Karl deep fakes being used to sell medicines with unapproved health\nclaims on Facebook and Instagram\n\nScammers on Facebook and Instagram are using a fake, AI-generated Dr Karl to\nsell health pills to Australians.\n\nRead more\n\nThe disturbing impacts of AI on our relationships and our grasp on reality\nitself could present a particular risk to teenagers.\n\nThink of a school student subjected to images of themselves run through\n\"nudifying apps\" that use AI to undress a fully clothed person.\n\n\"While their brain is still developing ... it's going to do pretty nasty\nthings to their mental health,\" Professor Pearson says.\n\nThese dangers are exacerbated by young people spending less time face-to-face\nwith others, which is linked to a decline in empathy and emotional\nintelligence, he says.\n\n## Cutting through the tech noise\n\nProfessor Pearson argues AI is presenting society with unprecedented\nchallenges and the technology should not be dismissed as just another \"tool\".\n\n\"You can't compare it to tools. The industrial revolution, the printing press,\nTVs, computers... This is radically different in ways that we don't fully\nunderstand.\"\n\nHe's calling for more research into the psychological impact of AI.\n\n\"I don't want to make people depressed and anxious about AI,\" Professor\nPearson says.\n\n\"There's a huge number of positives, but I've been pushing the psychological\npart of that because I don't see anyone else talking about it.\"\n\n### How AI is shaping elections around the world\n\nRecent election campaigns from Pakistan, India and Indonesia have shown\nradical new uses of generative AI that change how campaigns are run. Here's\nwhat's coming for Australia and the rest of the world.\n\nRead more\n\nIn the face of these changes, Professor Pearson suggests focusing on our\nhumanity.\n\n\"[Figure out] what are the core essentials of being human, and how do you want\nto create your own life in ways that might be independent from all this tech\nuncertainty.\"\n\n\"Is that going for a walk in nature, or is it just spending time with physical\nhumans and loved ones?\n\n\"I think over the next decade we're all going to be faced with soul-searching\njourneys like that. Why not start thinking about it now?\"\n\nProfessor Pearson says he's trying to apply these principles to his own life,\nwithout turning his back on technological advances.\n\n\"I'm trying to figure out how I can use AI to help me do more of the things I\nreally enjoy.\"\n\n\"My hope .. is that a lot of the things I've talked about won't be as\ncatastrophic as I'm making out.\n\n\"But I think raising the alarm now can avoid that pain and suffering later on\nand that's what I want to do.\"\n\nListen to the full episode \"Scarier than killer robots\": why your mind isn't\nready for AI and subscribe to RN's All in the Mind to explore other topics on\nthe mind, brain and behaviour.\n\n## Mental health in your inbox\n\nGet a selection of the best mental health content from across the ABC by\nsubscribing to our monthly newsletter\n\nYour information is being handled in accordance with the ABC Privacy\nCollection Statement.\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of\nService apply.\n\nPosted 16h ago16 hours agoTue 30 Apr 2024 at 8:00pm\n\nShare\n\n  * Copy\n  * Facebook\n  * X (formerly Twitter)\n\n## Related Stories\n\n  * ### A 'great flood' of AI noise is coming for the internet and it's swallowing Twitter first\n\n  * ### AI killed Leanne's copywriting business.
