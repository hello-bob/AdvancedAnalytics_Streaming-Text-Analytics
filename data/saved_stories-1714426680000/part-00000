What the Allies of WWII needed was something literally too big to\nfail. And one inventor working for the British Combined Operations\nHeadquarters (a department of the War Office) had an idea: a giant, floating,\nmobile and unsinkable island made of ice.\n\nConstruction concept for an ice-based aircraft carrier\n\nIt sounds at first like one of those far-fetched concepts floated by\nscientists throughout the war \u2014 a conflict-ending magic bullet too good to be\ntrue \u2014 but this proposal led to an actual 1,000-ton prototype approved by\nWinston Churchill himself and built in secret (and haste).\n\n## The Tip of the Ice Ship\n\nInventor Geoffrey Pyke saw a giant floating ice ship as a natural option in\nthe face of material limitations. Steel and aluminum were in short supply, but\nwater was everywhere. And making it into ice required relatively little\nenergy. So why not use ice instead of steel?\n\nProject Habakkuk model sections and cutaways\n\nPyke envisioned a giant aircraft-carrying vessel over a mile long with a solid\nhull made of ice. It would feature a long landing platform along the top and\ncentral void running its length below. This empty space would be able to\nshelter aircraft beneath the main landing surface. It was designed to be the\nlargest machine ever built on land or water. Its sheer size (and the ability\nto repair it with water) would make it effectively unsinkable \u2014 the ultimate\ntop-secret weapon.\n\nIn fact, Pyke was not even the first to envision a ship made of ice \u2014 it was\nsomething of a running joke in the British military for years prior. And for\ngood reason: ice is brittle and it melts. Icebergs also have a tendency to\nroll over from time to time. What Pyke needed was a way to keep it from\nmelting quickly and make it stable on the high seas.\n\nBut Pyke was regarded by his colleagues in Combined Operations as something of\na resident genius. And so he was given leave to pursue this insane-sounding\n\u201cbergship\u201d idea \u2014 he set to work finding a way to turn raw ice into a working\nsea-worthy vessel.\n\n## Perfecting Pykrete\n\nThe solution came in the form of something that came to be known as pykrete: a\nmixture of wood pulp and frozen water. Wood provided reinforcement, making up\nfor deficiencies in pure ice much like steel rebar helps concrete function in\nstructural contexts. Pykrete would float well and melt more slowly. It could\nbe machined like wood and cast like metal. Still, to keep it cold, a ship\nwould need to be insulated and require a system of on-board refrigeration to\nkeep it from melting.\n\nSchematic diagram showing integration of cooling ducts into pykrete hull\n\nMolecular biologist Max Perutz helped perfect the mixture of ice and pulp,\nconducting experiments in secret under the Smithfield Meat Market in London\n(behind a screen of animal carcasses). Later to win the Nobel Prize for work\non hemoglobin, Perutz was recruited at the time thanks to his expertise on\nglaciers and ice crystal structures.\n\nSatisfied with Perutz\u2019s results, Pyke brought his vision to Lord Mountbatten,\nChief of Combined Operations, who in turn took a sample block of pykrete\ndirectly to Prime Minister Churchill.\n\nAccording to Mountbatten, he found Churchill soaking in his tub and dropped in\nthe block of pykrete to demonstrate its buoyancy: \u201cAfter the outer film of ice\non the small pykrete cube had melted, the freshly exposed wood pulp kept the\nremainder of the block from thawing,\u201d reported Mountbatten of the interaction\nlater at a dinner party.\n\n## On a Wing and a Prayer\n\nThe development of pykrete was not without its incidents and setbacks. At a\npublic ballistics test (aiming to show that pykrete was bulletproof), a\nricocheting bullet bounced off a block of the stuff and grazed the leg of an\nadmiral. Stumbling blocks aside, however, a decision was made to pursue the\nproject with all haste.\n\nDetailed diagram of pykrete hull and refrigeration ducts for proposed ship\n\nThe sheer scale and audacity of the endeavor called for a name befitting its\nunbelievability. So they called it Project Habbakuk, in reference to the\nfollowing passage from the Hebrew Bible: \u201cBehold ye among the nations, and\nlook, and wonder marvelously; for I am working a work in your days, which ye\nwill not believe though it be told you.\u201d (Habbakuk 1:5)\n\n> \u201cBehold ye among the nations, and look, and wonder marvelously; for I am\n> working a work in your days, which ye will not believe though it be told\n> you.\u201d (Habbakuk 1:5)\n\nIn 1943, a prototype was commissioned. It would be constructed in Canada by\nconscientious objectors (who opted for alternative service jobs) unaware of\nthe project\u2019s purpose. A 1,000-ton scale model measuring 30 by 60 feet was\nbuilt on Patricia Lake in Alberta. It was kept frozen in the summer using just\na single-horsepower motor, designed to show off the technology under real-\nworld conditions.\n\nA complete, full-scale vessel was to be ordered following a successful test \u2014\none that would use at least 300,000 tons of wood pulp, 25,000 tons of\ninsulation, 35,000 tons of timber and 10,000 tons of steel.\n\n## Sunk Costs\n\nAs the project dragged on, complexities arose and new variables were\nintroduced for the test vessel as well as the huge ship it was supposed to\nherald. In the model, cold flow (ice deformation) raised the demand for steel\nas well as insulation.\n\nProject Habukkuk test site in Canada\n\nThe full-sized ship would also need to have a range of 7,000 miles, support\nheavy bombers and be torpedo-proof. It was to be over a mile in length, weigh\nas much as 2.2 million tons and require as many as 26 electric motors to move\nand steer across the ocean.\n\nIn the end, Project Habakkuk was scrapped thanks to a confluence of\ncircumstances. Its increased steel demands were too high, new airfields had\nreduced the need for carriers and longer-range fuel tanks were helping\naircraft fly further. The estimated price tag of 10 million British Pounds was\nalso seen as simply too high for an experimental craft.\n\nProject Habakkuk underwater plaque via the Alberta Diving Council\n\nStill, the prototype proved its potential, even once-neglected: it took three\nhot Canadian summers for the test vessel to completely melt. Its remains can\nbe found at the bottom of Patricia Lake in Jasper National Park, marked by an\nunderwater plaque.\n\n99% Invisible\n\nThe Ice King\n\n#### Episode 198\n\n### The Ice King\n\n  * PlayPause\n  * Add to QueueRemove from Queue\n  * Download\n\n### Enjoy 99pi?
