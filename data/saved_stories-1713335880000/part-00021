Anne Meadows for\nAtlas Obscura, data from FSI\n\nFor English-speakers, Romanian is easier to learn than German. And you\u2019ll be\nspeaking Swahili sooner than Polish.\n\nHow is that? Because the Foreign Service Institute says so. Located in\nArlington, Virginia, the FSI is the U.S. government\u2019s main provider of foreign\naffairs training, including language courses.\n\nAs the chief learning organization for the State Department, the FSI is where\ndiplomats go to study the languages they will need on foreign postings. The\nInstitute has a very practical approach to languages, dividing them into four\ncategories, depending solely on how long it takes to learn them.\n\nATLAS OBSCURA COURSES\n\nLearn with Us!\n\nCheck out our lineup of courses taught by world-class experts from around the\nworld. See Courses\n\nThis map shows how the FSI judges the difficulty of European languages. Note\nthat the Institute only teaches languages that are required for diplomatic\nintercourse; hence the gray spots on the map.\n\nYou won\u2019t find any courses in Basque (the area straddling the Franco-Spanish\nborder), Breton (in the \u201cnose\u201d of France), Welsh (in, ehm, Wales), or Scots or\nIrish Gaelic in Arlington. In the countries where those minority languages are\nspoken, you\u2019ll get by with Spanish, French, and English.\n\nEnglish, by the way, is a \u201cCategory 0\u201d language (also gray on the map),\nmeaning that Americans are expected to be proficient in it. English is of\ncourse an official language in Ireland and the UK, but also in Malta (although\nit also has its native Maltese language, which is based on Sicilian Arabic and\nis the only Semitic language to have official status in the European Union).\n\n\u201cCategory I\u201d languages (in red on the map) are the easiest for English\nspeakers, who should be able to reach reading and speaking proficiency within\napproximately 24\u201330 weeks (i.e. a little less than half a year of intense\nstudy).\n\nDoes this explain your grades in Spanish and French class? Anne Meadows for\nAtlas Obscura, data from FSI\n\nThese languages include both Germanic ones (Dutch, Danish, Norwegian, and\nSwedish) and Romance ones (French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Romanian).\nThat may seem strange, since English is more closely related to the former\nthan the latter.\n\nHowever, the peculiar history of English means that it is heavily influenced\nby French (and Latin), especially in vocabulary. One study says that the share\nof Latin and French words in English is greater than that of Germanic origin\n(29% each, versus 26%).\n\nGerman, on the other hand, might share a lot of basic vocab with English, but\naccording to the FSI it is a \u201cCategory II\u201d language (orange)\u2014meaning that it\nwould require around 36 weeks of intense study to master written and spoken\nproficiency.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t quite chime with the experience of Mark Twain, who wrote that:\n\n> \u201c(m)y philological studies have satisfied me that a gifted person ought to\n> learn English (barring spelling and pronouncing) in thirty hours, French in\n> thirty days, and German in thirty years. It seems manifest, then, that the\n> latter tongue ought to be trimmed down and repaired. If it is to remain as\n> it is, it ought to be gently and reverently set aside among the dead\n> languages, for only the dead have time to learn it.\u201d\n\nSo why is German rated a grade more difficult than Dutch, which is a directly\nrelated language, or even than Romanian, which is from another language family\naltogether?\n\nBecause, despite the large extent to which the vocabulary of German is cognate\nwith that of English, the grammar of German is way more complex than that of\nDutch or Romanian among others\u2014or English itself, for that matter.\n\nFor example, German nouns are gendered, meaning they are either male, female,\nor neutral. This is not always logical. Yes, der Mann is male and die Frau is\nfemale, but das M\u00e4dchen (the girl) is neutral. And like Latin, German has\ndifferent cases\u2014\u201cof the man\u201d: des Mannes (genitive), \u201cto the woman\u201d: zu der\nFrau (dative), and so on. And don\u2019t get us started on verb conjugations, word\norder, and detachable prefixes!\n\nGrammar is a major factor for language learn times. Thomas Nugent/CC BY-SA 2.0\n\nStill, German is a breeze compared to Europe\u2019s \u201cCategory III\u201d languages (in\ngreen)\u2014basically all the Slavic ones (Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, Czech,\nSlovak, Slovenian, Serbo-Croatian, Macedonian, Bulgarian), two of the three\nBaltic ones (Lithuanian and Latvian), plus Greek, Albanian, Turkish, and\nIcelandic.\n\nThe latter four are mutually completely unintelligible, as are the Baltic and\nSlavic families with all the others, but they share a level of difficulty.\nAccording to the FSI, it will take you about 10 months (i.e. 44 weeks) of\nfull-time study to get the hang of any of these.\n\nThere are no \u201cCategory IV\u201d languages in Europe, but the blue bits on the map\nhint at where\u2014and what\u2014they might be: Arabic, spoken, among other places, in\nMorocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, on the southern edge of this map. Getting a\ngood grasp of Arabic would require at least 88 weeks of day in, day out\nstudying.\n\nSo why is Arabic harder than, for example, Turkish? Both languages are equally\nunrelated to English. While that may be so, Turkish has an easy orthography\n(in Latin script, unlike Arabic), an uncomplicated case system, and extremely\nregular verb declensions\u2014all factors which distinguish it from Arabic.\n\nOf course, the FSI system does not stop at Europe\u2019s borders.\n\n  * German is the only European \u201cCategory II\u201d language in the FSI ranking; Indonesian, Malay, Haitian Creole, and Swahili are the others.\n  * Hebrew, Hindi, Mongolian, Thai, Vietnamese, and Burmese are some examples of non-European \u201cCategory III\u201d languages.\n  * The only other \u201cCategory IV\u201d languages apart from Arabic are Cantonese, Mandarin, Korean, and Japanese.\n\nConsidering all that effort, why would an English-speaker\u2014even a\ndiplomat\u2014learn another language? Doesn\u2019t everybody else speak English anyway?\n\nLearning another language makes you a better communicator. Igor\nBelousov/flickr\n\nTrue, English will get you pretty far in the world, but not everywhere.\nSpeaking the local language\u2014or at least making a decent effort to do so\u2014will\nearn you good will and open doors that otherwise may stay closed.\n\nAnother reason is that being English-only speakers may be a disadvantage even\nif everybody else speaks English. According to a BBC article, native English\nspeakers are the world\u2019s worst communicators. Being monolingual means they are\nless proficient in detecting the subtleties of language variation than non-\nnative speakers of English.\n\nThose non-native speakers will be less proficient in slang, word-play, and\ncultural-specific references, and will avoid them more than monolingual\nAnglophones. In fact, they are better at using English as a lingua franca than\nnative English speakers.\n\nAlso, learning another language exercises the brain and provides insight into\nanother culture. As the saying goes: \u201cAs many languages you speak, so many\ntimes are you human.\u201d\n\nIn the original Latin, that\u2019s: \u201cQuot linguas calles, tot homines vales.\u201d The\nquote is by Emperor Charles V (1500-1558), who also said: \u201cI speak in Latin to\nGod, Italian to women, French to men, and German to my horse.\u201d\n\nNeigh twice for the accusative, Misty!\n\nThis article was updated and originally appeared on Big Think, home of the\nbrightest minds and biggest ideas of all time.
