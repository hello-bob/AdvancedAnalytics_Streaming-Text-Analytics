One\nwandered the stacks, picking up fascinating volumes at random, discovering\nwhole fields and respected authors one had never heard of. The knowledge was\nright there, between the covers of books, many books in a row all on the same\nsubject.\n\nNo longer. Public libraries have become deeply depressing places.\n\nNow, I have occasionally visited the Ohio State University library. It hasn\u2019t\nchanged much, and the experience I described can still be had there. In fact,\nit has grown, and while many of the stacks have moved off campus to a special\nfacility, a massive selection remains for browsing.\n\nBut at the once-enormous Columbus Metropolitan Library, regarded as one of the\nbest less than twenty years ago according to the Hennen\u2019s American Public\nLibrary Rating, everything has changed.\n\nNot the library I visited, but it was very much along these lines:\ndepressingly bare of books and people reading them.\n\nI had to visit the main library because I needed access to the Foundation\nDirectory (for fundraising for the Knowledge Standards Foundation). Access was\navailable only on the premises. When I arrived, I was greeted, well,\nstrangely: two or three librarians stood next to modern check-out desks,\nlooking (could it have just been my imagination?) hungrily at the visitors,\neager to have someone to help. I told them the reason for my visit and they\nsaid I would need a library card. It seems my old library card number was no\nlonger recognized in the system, so a new one was issued on the spot. The\nlibrarians were helpful and the procedure was quick and easy.\n\nActually, I had visited the main library a year or two before, after the\ngutting. So I knew what to expect. Yet when I climbed the stairs to the main\nstacks, I was still shocked and disturbed. The books! Where are the books?\nGone!\n\nNo, not entirely gone. Just mostly gone. There used to be rows upon rows of\nstacks, the typical tall sort, from floor to ceiling; I believe it required a\nstool to stand on to get books from the top shelf. Now the stacks are half-\nsized, like the stacks in the children\u2019s section, as if they simply didn\u2019t\nhave enough books to fill the space\u2014which, I suppose, is now true. At the\nonce-glorious Columbus library, where once there had been more books than in\nmany college libraries, now there are opens vistas of empty floor and (even on\na late Tuesday afternoon after school) mostly-unused chairs and tables, which\nare placed far apart, as if Covid is still raging. As a free co-working space,\nthis sort of thing is rather nice, perhaps. But on second thought, not really:\nsocial distancing makes for a cold and uninviting space. There is also a third\nfloor, with more books. But again, the stacks are shrunken, a shadow of their\nformer selves.\n\nI looked at subjects I am familiar with, philosophy and theology. The\nofferings are now pitiful. I remember thinking, in years gone by, that while\nnot nearly as good as Ohio State\u2019s selection, at least the main branch had a\nvery solid and respectable collection of philosophy books. I was rather proud\nof my local library. This is all changed. Most of the selections are\npopular\u2014the sorts of things one might find at the local Barnes and Noble. Most\nof the classics that could be reliably found on the shelves are gone.\n\nThe Columbus Metro Library \u201creading room.\u201d Empty of both people and books.\n\nThe library has been deliberately gutted\u2014dumbed down and turned into a co-\nworking space. Not just that. It is now a \u201ccommunity space.\u201d The only real\nglory of the library is the children\u2019s area, which seems to be clean, safe,\nand well-stocked. But next to it is a vast atrium, through which after-school\nteenagers and many bums mill about or camp on the floor. A coffee shop\ndominates the space, and a very small bookshop. While I was using the\nrestroom, I noticed one bum lying on his side in a stall looking up at me\nsleepily through the floor-level gap. I greeted him and went about my\nbusiness: who can blame him for being there? It\u2019s a community space. On the\nsecond floor is a teenagers\u2019 area, with games and televisions, because as\neverybody knows, that\u2019s what a library is all about. When I told the librarian\nthat I was researching nonprofits, she (not having anything better to do)\nrather proudly ushered me to the \u201cnonprofit area,\u201d a rather more elaborate co-\nworking space. But there is nothing there that I could not get elsewhere in\nthe area: access to the library wifi, which is all I needed to have access to\nthe database.\n\nIt won\u2019t do to tell me that people read ebooks now. I know that. I\u2019m not\nimpressed by that argument. First of all, not everybody does. And in any case,\nyou can\u2019t browse ebooks the way you can browse stacks of real paper books.\nLibrary ebook holdings are ephemeral: you lose the subscription, you lose the\nbooks. Paper books require no subscription. And the sense of being among\ncrowds of brilliant thinkers and writers is gone: modern library authors more\nnearly resemble marketers and influencers.\n\nAnd the old library serendipity is gone. Maybe that\u2019s the worse part. The\nlibrary no longer conveys awe and mystery.\n\nBy the way, did you know that, especially with Covid, libraries have been\njoining teacher unions? I want to criticize neither teachers nor librarians\nbecause they are not well-paid and they do serve an essential role in society.\nBut library leadership complains bitterly about conservative demands to remove\npornography from school libraries; how ironic. \u201cCensorship!\u201d they cry. Should\nwe not more strongly cry \u201ccensorship\u201d when they cull thousands of good old\nvolumes from their collections? And surely we will not go too far amiss if we\nsuspect this action of having political motives: other aspects of education\nhave also been politicized, even radicalized, in recent years.\n\nLibraries can and should be beautiful, because books are beautiful.\n\nWell, I have an idea. Why don\u2019t libraries invest their resources in buying,\nwell, some books? Why not a full collection of all the classics? There aren\u2019t\nthat many, and they are not expensive, or rather, they can be obtained and\nprinted in inexpensive editions. What I ask here is quite reasonable: have all\nof the classics in paper form. Why don\u2019t libraries stock the top 10,000 public\ndomain classics, for ease of access, lack of dependence on the Internet,\nserendipity, and in support of a solid liberal arts education? I calculate\naround 70 college library bookcases. That would not be that much space:\nperhaps 750 square feet of floor space. But at least that knowledge would be\npreserved for the lifetime of those books, which can be quite substantial.\nTheir presence would support the more scholarly public\u2014not a small\ncommunity\u2014who greatly desire ease of access to such books.\n\nLibrarians do care about liberal arts education, right? Surely they do.\n\nby\n\nLarry Sanger\n\n\u201cInternet Knowledge Organizer.\u201d Currently President of the Knowledge Standards\nFoundation, started Wikipedia and various other educational and reference\nsites.

Terry Brewer\n\nMarch 27, 2024\n\nI have been perusing thrift stores, library \u201csales\u201d, yard sales and online\nauctions, in an attempt to increase my limited-space, home library. It started\nout as a \u201cwhat if\u201d library, as in, what if the power grid goes down, or what\nif it\u2019s no longer safe to leave your home and go to the library. Now it\u2019s an\nattempt to prepare for what appears to be one of the darkest moments in the\nhistory of our planet.\n\nVery grateful for the work you do, Mr. Sanger. I just hope civilization is\naround long enough to enjoy your efforts.\n\nReply\n\n    1. Larry Sanger\n\nMarch 27, 2024\n\nThanks, Terry. Good luck with your library!\n\nReply\n\n  2. Jonathan Blamey\n\nMarch 27, 2024\n\nA really good idea. I try to get my Philosophy students to read the seminal\nworks. But it hardly occurs to me to suggest a library. Obvious the (talking\nfrom the U.K.) university libraries a very good, but over the last 20 years it\nis increasingly difficult to get access. And those who do have access don\u2019t\nneed it because their online subscription comes with Athens etc. The so called\n\u201cInformation Age\u201d has amounted to the grand scale privatisation of Knowledge.\nAncient knowledge that the internet promised to make available to all of us,\nhas resulted in government and private gate keepers making these resources as\nscarce as other commodities.\n\nReply\n\n    1. Larry Sanger\n\nMarch 27, 2024\n\nI pay $50 or $100 per year for a \u201cfriends of the library\u201d subscription to the\nOhio State University library, which is very big. Worth it.\n\nReply\n\n  3. Laura\n\nMarch 31, 2024\n\nI must admit that I haven\u2019t seen the inside of my local public library in many\nyears. The policy here is that my library card has to be renewed every year\nand there\u2019s not much there to make the trip worth it. They used to subscribe\nto Ancestry.com and a couple of other genealogy websites, but no more.\n\nI, too, like the feel of a paper book in my hands, as opposed to my husband\nwho loves his Kindle edition library books. I get my books from yard and\nestate sales and book exchanges at the campgrounds we frequent. And have\ncollected many books for our home library...no electricity or batteries\nrequired for reading!\n\nLove your essays.\n\nReply\n\n    1. Larry Sanger\n\nApril 1, 2024\n\nThanks, Laura!\n\nReply\n\n  4. Portia\n\nApril 7, 2024\n\nThanks for these thoughts. I have always loved libraries and physical books\nand never thought much about \u2018curation\u2019 until recently, when there is so much\noutrage about \u2018being offensive\u2019 in a political sense as regards books that\nreflect actual thought of actual people living actual lives. Sure, there were\nattempts to ban \u201cHuckleberry Finn\u201d when I was a child, but it\u2019s much more\nridiculous now that people\u2019s fee-fees are so much easier to ruffle and it\u2019s as\nif \u2018removing\u2019 inconvenient thought will make everything OK for them. I am\nreferring to philosophical and creative works, not porn, here. Porn takes one\nto an altogether different (and temporary) place, and libraries have no reason\nto stock them\u2013it\u2019s everywhere. I wonder if channeling access to online sources\nis just more centralization and frankly the need to spy on what we are\nreading, and provide a black hole for some books to fall into. Now we need\n\u201cbook savers\u201d the way we have \u201cseed savers\u201d to preserve hybrid thought.\n\nReply\n\n  5. Candy\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\nHi Mr. Sanger, I used to love taking my kids to the Salt Lake City Library,\nbut no longer. They stock books under the American Library Association\ndirectives , which are horrid! Libraries used to promote American citizenship\nand civil duties and rights. Now it\u2019s pushing neomarxist woke garbage and\ntheir is literally hard core pornography on the tax funded children\u2019s\nbookshelves. They reflect the degeneration of our culture, morality and\nintellect. I\u2019m working with parents to get them to remove pornography from the\nchildren\u2019s section. Frankly, it\u2019s another corrupted institution, following in\nthe footsteps of major academic institutions, Wikipedia (written by the CIA\npropagandists), science for hire, for profit medical institutions and so on\nand so forth. Like George Carlin said: they want us dumbed down and\ncomplacent.\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nLog in\n\nLarrySanger.org\n\n", "frontpage": false}
