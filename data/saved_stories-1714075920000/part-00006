The\nZephyr, made by Aalto, weighs just 65kg.\n\nIts light weight helps the craft reach dizzying heights. Unlike conventional\naircraft, which typically fly between 30,000 and 40,000 feet, Aalto is one of\nseveral British ventures blazing a trail in the stratosphere, the region of\nour airspace that starts at 60,000 feet.\n\n\u201cIt flies at twice the height of airliner, but at the speed of a bicycle,\u201d\nstaff politely explain on the production line.\n\nIt\u2019s here, in the cold, thin air that was previously the sole domain of spy\nplanes like Lockheed\u2019s U-2, where Britain has taken an unlikely pioneering\nlead. Aircraft that inhabit this domain are called \u201cHigh Altitude Platforms\u201d,\nor HAPS.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pseudo satellite,\u201d explains Tim Robinson of the Royal Aeronautical\nSociety.\n\nNot quite in space but above the weather systems, these HAPS can offer the\nsame services as a satellite: chiefly, imaging and communications.\n\nAalto \u2013 a loss-making business that employs hundreds of people \u2013 seems an\nunlikely contender to take on the swagger and wealth of rocket man Elon Musk,\nwhose SpaceX has sent more than 5,000 Starlink satellites into orbit.\n\nSpaceX\u2019s infrastructure has become a crucial enabler of everything from rural\ninternet access to warfare manoeuvres in Ukraine.\n\nHowever, it turns out there\u2019s a lot that Zephyrs can do that a satellite can\u2019t\n\u2013 and at a fraction of the price.\n\n\u201cIt opens up this new vista: it doesn\u2019t cost as much as a satellite, and you\ncan roam around the world,\u201d says Robinson.\n\n\u201cSatellites don\u2019t loiter in one place, but [these] can, for weeks or even\nmonths. For example, you could provide spot coverage for the M25, and steer\nthe beam to where there\u2019s a traffic jam.\u201d\n\nZephyr has its genesis in Britain\u2019s top secret \u201cQ department\u201d: QinetiQ. The\nBritish defence contractor, which was spun out of the Ministry of Defence in\n2001 and was named for James Bond\u2019s fictional gadget workshop, developed the\nHAPS craft before selling it to Airbus in 2013.\n\nTwo years ago, this pilotless twin-propeller craft almost beat the world\nrecord for the world\u2019s longest unmanned flight \u2013 staying aloft for 64 days\npowered only by the sun.\n\nGhosting its way around the world, Zephyr silently covers tens of thousands of\nmiles. This requires such precision engineering that even small stickers on\nthe craft were rejected for adding too much weight.\n\nChief executive Samer Halawi says the business is looking beyond defence deals\nCredit: Paul Grover\n\nAalto is now signing civilian deals and \u201clooking to enter into commercial\nservice by early 2026\u201d, says chief executive Samer Halawi, the American\nsatellite industry veteran tapped to lead the team.\n\n\u201cUntil then we\u2019re developing the aircraft, and developing the payloads,\u201d he\nsays during a tour of its Farnborough base. \u201cWe\u2019re also working with the CAA\nto drive the regulation of this airspace. We\u2019re hoping it will be the first in\nthe world to do so.\u201d\n\nIt is eyeing opportunities in imaging and mobile telecommunications.\n\nZephyr can extend the reach of a mobile network to give rural areas \u201cdirect to\ndevice\u201d 4G or 5G broadband: unlike a satellite, customers don\u2019t need to buy a\ndish, or a special phone.\n\nAalto already has exploratory deals with a number of mobile operators to\nextend coverage to low population areas where mast coverage is patchy.\n\nWith millions of people across the globe seeking to migrate, border security\nhas emerged as another area where the gossamer craft can have application. The\nZephyrs can go on patrol to seek out people smugglers, for example.\n\nAnd of course, with its ability to perform stealthy long range missions \u2013 some\nas much as 30,000 miles long \u2013 it is being explored for military strategic\naerial reconnaissance tasks, too.\n\nSeeing the production line is unnerving: the craft has all the apparent\nvulnerability of an early biplane.\n\nHowever, it packs the most advanced new materials. The solar panels are\nspecially designed and are as thin as film.\n\nNone of Zephyr\u2019s feats would be possible without the advent of new carbon\nfibre materials and ever-denser packs of electronic sensors. The designers\nsought material from Formula One teams, but it took five rounds before they\ncould source a material both strong and light enough for its purposes.\n\n\u201cWe actually had to go back to the early days of aviation to design the\npropellers,\u201d says one. \u201cAircraft had not flown this slowly since the 1920s.\u201d\n\nLaunching a Zephyr entails a precarious, spiralling ascent that can take\nupwards of 10 hours. Reaching into the stratosphere is evidently difficult \u2013\nso why bother?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s super cold up there, as it\u2019s very rarefied air. But once you get above\nthe weather it\u2019s quite benign from an aerodynamic point of view,\u201d says\nRobinson.\n\nThe extremely light Zephyr requires calm weather for its ascent above the\nclouds Credit: Paul Grover for the Telegraph\n\nThe commercial proposition still shouldn\u2019t make sense at first glance, given\nhow far satellites and drones have advanced recently. But each of these rival\ntechnologies has its drawbacks.\n\nLow-cost rocketry has transformed the economics of space, making photography\nand communications missions cheaper than ever. But the price of the ticket for\na freight customer is still steep.\n\nThere are other drawbacks too. Satellites are often not where you need them to\nbe and they can only take a snapshot of a target as they zoom past at 17,000\nmph.\n\nThere are also serious long-term question marks against the economic viability\nof the vast low-earth orbit (LEO) constellations such as Starlink.\n\nParent company SpaceX can launch thousands a year, but the lifespan of each\none is very short. The fuel supply runs out within five years. Thousands more\nare then needed to replace them.\n\n\u201cConstellations [of satellites] are good technologies \u2013 but do they serve the\nmarket?\u201d asks Halawi. \u201cNo LEO project has ever made money today. Everyone has\ngone bankrupt.\u201d\n\nFor their part, drones have brought a new dimension to warfare and\nsurveillance \u2013 taking a human pilot out of the firing line.\n\nBut most are capable of only short, typically 12-hour missions \u2013 far shorter\nthan the days and weeks a stealthy Zephyr can clock. They\u2019re also visible to\nradar and easy to shoot down. At up to $100m a time, that\u2019s expensive, says\nHalawi.\n\nA Zephyr offers up something quite different: it silently persists over a\ntarget for days at a time.\n\n\u201cYou can track an asset, or stay over an asset, over a long period of time. It\ndoesn\u2019t have to be one snapshot every two hours, or every day,\u201d says Halawi.\n\nFor emergency services communications following a natural disaster, or for a\nspecific event such as the Olympics, the Zephyr is therefore a good option.\n\nRather than just selling its crafts, Aalto also plans to offer these\ncapabilities as a service.\n\nIt has designs to build five or six \u201cAalto ports\u201d around the world in\nlocations with calm, predictable weather for the ascent.\n\nThe real estate required is not much more than a 50-metre diameter \u2013 and\nmatters much less than weather. As for manufacturing, Halawi thinks \u201cright now\na lot will be built here, at least for now\u201d.\n\nHe adds: \u201cWe have the opportunity to push the UK into the forefront of\ninnovation. We\u2019re doing it the right way.\u201d\n\nRelated Topics\n\n  * Drones (aircraft),\n  * SpaceX,\n  * Elon Musk,\n  * Space,\n  * Aviation,\n  * Ministry of Defence\n\n58\n\nLicense this content\n\n## Comments\n\nThe Telegraph values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic,\nconstructive and respectful.
