The TRE\ntechnique was developed as part of the NESC study, Flight Mechanics Analysis\nTools Interoperability and Component Sharing, to develop interfaces to support\ninteroperability between several of NASA\u2019s institutional flight mechanics\ntools.\n\nThe development of space missions involves multiple design tools, requiring\nthe transfer of trajectories between them\u2014a task that demands a large amount\nof trajectory data such as frames, states, state and time parametrizations,\nand dynamical and numerical models. This is a tedious and time-consuming task\nthat is not always effective, particularly on complex dynamics where small\nvariations in the models can cause trajectories to diverge in the\nreconstruction process.\n\nThe TRE strategy is a trajectory-sharing process that is agnostic to the\nmodels used and performed through a common object: the spacecraft and planet\nkernels (SPK), developed at JPL Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility.\nThe use of this common object aims to lay the groundwork for a global flight\nmechanics tool interoperability system (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. A) Interoperability between flight mechanics tools using\nstandardized trajectory structures. B) Traditional specific tool-to-tool\ninterface design.\n\nAn SPK file serves as a container object, representing a trajectory as a 6D\ninvariant structure in phase-space, agnostic to gravitational environments,\nfidelity models, or numerical representation of the system. A judicious kernel\nscan is used to recover the trajectory in any new tool, with the minimum (or\nno) information from the generating source. Impulsive maneuvers can be\nextracted in the form of velocity discontinuities, finite burns can be\ndetected as variations on the energy of the system, and natural bodies\nconforming the trajectory universe can be directly read from the kernel.\n\nStates or control points are found at predetermined time intervals or\nstrategic points along the trajectory (e.g., periapsis, apoapsis, flybys\nclosest approach), which are then used to reconstruct the trajectory timeline.\nThe trajectory can be propagated forward in time using the selected set of\ncontrol points. Due to the discrepancy between tool models, small or large\ndiscontinuities might appear between the integrated legs, which can be\nsmoothed by the implementation of a multiple-shooting algorithm (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2. Multiple-shooting algorithm, utilizing strategic control points and\na forward-backward propagation scheme.\n\nThe TRE strategy was successfully implemented for Monte and Copernicus in the\nform of Python scripts (examples of reconstructed trajectories from SPK for\neach of these tools are shown in Figure 3). Through an optional user input\nfile, a user can configure their specific problem. User-defined constraints\nare also possible, but their implementation would depend on the specific tool.\nThe benefits of this effort include cost reduction through the sharing of\ncapabilities, acceleration of the turnaround process involving various\nanalysis tools at different stages of mission development, improved design\nsolutions through multi-tool mission designs, and a reduction in development\nredundancy.\n\nReference:\n\n  1.
