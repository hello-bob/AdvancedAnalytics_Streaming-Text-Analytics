The assurance that Julian Assange will be\nallowed to rely on the First Amendment in his defence is a blatantly weak\npiece of sophistry.\n\nYou can read my analysis on the High Court judgment of Assange\u2019s right to an\nappeal here.\n\nLet me dispense with the assurance against the death penalty. I am sure it\nwill be accepted by the court. The USA does not need to execute Julian, it can\nincarcerate him in a tiny concrete tomb for life, under extreme sensory\ndeprivation, as a terrible half living warning to any journalist who might\nreveal their crimes.\n\nShould that ever become inconvenient, he can be Epsteined or Seth Riched at\nany moment. Remember this is a government that plotted to kidnap and/or\nassassinate him, as pled and not denied in court.\n\nThe assurance required on First Amendment protection is being misunderstood by\nalmost everybody reporting it, and the US Diplomatic Note seeks to take\nadvantage of the confusion.\n\nThe High Court took the view that the First Amendment provides the same\nprotections as Article X of the European Convention on Human Rights, and\ntherefore Assange\u2019s Convention rights will be protected if he is allowed to\nplead the First Amendment as a defence before a US court. The court did not\nask for an assurance that such a plea would succeed. Article X of the ECHR is\nitself absolutely shot through with authoritarian national security and other\nexceptions.\n\nThe assurance on which the High Court did insist was that such a plea could\nnot be struck down on the grounds of Assange\u2019s nationality. That would\ncontradict the separate ECHR provision against discrimination by nationality.\nThe US Diplomatic Note has failed genuinely to address this point: but it\npretends to do so.\n\nThe US prosecutor in an affidavit to the UK court had already stated that\nAssange may be barred from First Amendment protection because he was a foreign\nnational who had acted abroad. Mike Pompeo had also stated this officially.\nThe principle is plainly articulated by the Supreme Court in the case of USAID\nvs Open Society:\n\nTHE CRUCIAL \u201cSEEK TO\u201d\n\nThe United States was therefore simply unable to state that Julian Assange\nwill be able to make a First Amendment defence, because the judge, following\nthe Supreme Court precedent, is almost certainly going to disallow it on\ngrounds of nationality.\n\nThe Diplomatic Note therefore states that Assange may seek to raise a First\nAmendment defence without prohibition on grounds of nationality. This means\nprecisely that his lawyers are permitted to say:\n\n\u201cMy client wishes to claim the protection of the First Amendment for freedom\nof speech\u201d\n\nThis is \u201cseeking to raise\u201d it.\n\nThe judge will immediately reply:\n\n\u201cThe First Amendment does not apply to your client as a foreign national\nacting abroad, as established by the US Supreme Court in USAid vs Open\nSociety\u201d.\n\nThat is consistent with the actual operative phrase in the US Diplomatic Note:\n\u201cA decision as to the applicability of the First Amendment is entirely within\nthe purview of the US Courts\u201d.\n\nOn 20 May there will be a hearing to determine whether this non-assurance is\nadequate to protect Julian Assange from discrimination on grounds of\nnationality and permit the extradition to proceed.\n\nNow being a reasonable person, you doubtless are thinking that it is\nimpossible that such a flimsy confection of legal sleight of hand could ever\nbe accepted. But if so, dear reader, you have no idea of the corruption of the\nstool pigeons disguised as British judges.\n\nWho would think that they could have ruled that the UK/US Treaty has legal\nforce to extradite Julian Assange, but that Article IV of the Treaty excluding\npolitical offence strangely does not have legal force? Who would have thought\nthat they could have ruled that the US government spying on his\nattorney/client legal conferences and seizing his legal papers did not\ninvalidate the proceedings? Who would have thought they could have ruled that\nthe US government plot to kidnap or murder him is irrelevant, because if he is\nextradited the US government will have no further need to kidnap or murder\nhim?\n\nI could go on. I shall be very surprised if the High Court judges following\nthe 20 May hearing do not rule that the right to ask not to be discriminated\nagainst on grounds of nationality (and be denied) is sufficient protection\nagainst discrimination by nationality.\n\nThey really are that shameless.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nForgive me for pointing out that my ability to provide this coverage is\nentirely dependent on your kind voluntary subscriptions which keep this blog\ngoing.

However, as our host intimates, such sophistry can have\ndisastrous consequences for innocent plaintiffs and defendants in British\ncourts, as anyone who followed the garbled reasoning deployed to such effect\nin the case of the Birmingham six and other victims of injustice must have\nseen. That the matter of the First amendment will remain in the purview of the\nUS courts is a flagrant affront to the British courts insistence that Julian\nbe granted the same constitutional rights as any other defendant in a US\ncourt, for, as Craig notes, for him to be merely granted the right to petition\nthe court for such protection is almost certainly for the said petition to\nfall on deaf ears, as any contrary ruling would set a precedent which would\ngreatly restrict the power of the US state to punish its critics. It may well\nbe that it is this last consideration which prompted Joe Biden to float the\nidea of dropping the prosecution of Julian, and indeed no other\n\n### Support This Website\n\n### Books by Craig Murray\n\n### Popular Posts\n\n  * I Stand in Blackburn\n  * The Farce of Diplomatic Assurances\n  * Free at Last\n  * An Urgent Message About Gaza\n  * The Assange Hearing Permission Appeal Judgment: Mad and Bad.\n  * About Craig Murray\n  * The Panic Of the Ruling Class\n  * Scotland\u2019s Hate Speech Act and Abuse of Process\n  * Rethinking Ukraine: Putin and the Mystery of National Identity\n  * Incredibly, I Face Investigation for Terrorism \u2013 Defence Funds Appeal\n\n### Search Site\n\n### Archives\n\n### Categories\n\n### Still Discussing\n\nThe BBC World War Two Porn Page\n\nNot forgetting the al-Hillis-continued\n\nDisappearing Aircraft\n\n### Site Forums\n\nDiscussion Forums\n\nBlog Support Forum\n\n### New Forum Posts\n\n  * Disappearing posts\n\n2 weeks, 1 day ago\n\n  * Trump v Biden\n\n1 week, 2 days ago\n\n  * Insertion point wandering while typing blog comments\n\n3 weeks, 1 day ago\n\n### Recent Forum Replies\n\n  * Allan Howard on Climate Change Denialists (who get all shy) 4 hours, 20 minutes ago\n  * Allan Howard on Climate Change Denialists (who get all shy) 6 hours, 8 minutes ago\n  * AG on Ukraine (Date: Nov. 2023) 15 hours, 44 minutes ago\n\n### Random Posts\n\n  * Debate chat #11\n  * Hunt for CIA \u2018black site\u2019 in Poland\n  * Housekeeping\n  * The Complexity of Truth\n  * Terrorism and Nuance\n\n### Blogroll\n\n  * Bloggerheads\n  * Glenn Greenwald\n  * Juan Cole\n  * Lenin's Tomb\n  * Obsolete\n  * Subrosa Blonde\n\n### Books by Craig Murray\n\n### Click any book above\n\n### Recent Posts\n\n  * The Farce of Diplomatic Assurances\n  * I Stand in Blackburn\n  * Free at Last\n  * An Urgent Message About Gaza\n  * The Assange Hearing Permission Appeal Judgment: Mad and Bad.\n  * Injured\n  * Scotland\u2019s Hate Speech Act and Abuse of Process\n  * Assange Truth and UN Shenanigans\n\nBlog Home Page\n\n\u00b7 \u00a9 2024 Craig Murray \u00b7 Powered by \u00b7 Designed with the Customizr Theme \u00b7\n\n", "frontpage": false}
