A few weeks ago, the\nobservatory announced that its digital camera, the largest one ever made, is\ncomplete.\n\nNow the observatory has announced that its unique primary/tertiary mirror has\nits first reflective coating.\n\nThe Rubin\u2019s massive digital camera has an important job and garners a lot of\nattention. But it\u2019s powerless without the telescope\u2019s innovative\nprimary/tertiary mirror. Primary mirrors are always the most critical and\ntime-consuming part of modern observatories. The VRO\u2019s primary/tertiary mirror\ntook seven years to make.\n\nThe mirror is called a primary/tertiary mirror because it comprises two\noptical surfaces with different curvatures. The primary mirror is 8.4 meters,\nwhile the tertiary mirror is 5 meters in diameter. The pair of surfaces are\ncombined into one large structure. The unique design reduces the telescope\u2019s\nengineering complexity without reducing its impressive light-gathering\ncapability. It can be rotated quickly and also settles quickly.\n\nThe VRO\u2019s unique primary/tertiary mirror is two mirrors in one. It\u2019s mounted\non lightweight honeycomb material for strength.

It captures light from space\nfirst, then that light reflects upwards to the 3.4-meter secondary mirror.\nAfter that, it\u2019s reflected back down to the inner 5.0-meter surface that forms\nthe tertiary mirror. Then, the light is sent to the camera.\n\nThe primary mirror\u2019s size is critical because it determines how much light the\ntelescope can collect. More light means astronomers can study very faint or\ndistant objects. The VRO\u2019s design allows the camera to capture a large area of\nsky the size of 7 full moons across in a single image.\n\nvia GIPHY\n\nOnly meticulous engineering and construction can build a telescope like this.\nOne of the stages is putting the reflective and protective coatings on the\nmirrors. The VRO announced that the primary/tertiary mirror has its first\ncoating.\n\n> \u201cThis was a very well-conducted project from every angle, thanks to a\n> combination of careful planning and the technical skills of our excellent\n> team.\u201d\n>\n> Tomislav Vucina, Senior Coating Engineer, VRO\n\nThe VRO has a special onsite coating chamber built just for this purpose. It\u2019s\na 128-ton chamber on the observatory\u2019s maintenance floor. It uses a process\ncalled magnetron sputtering to apply coatings. The chamber will be reused\nduring the telescope\u2019s lifetime whenever the mirror needs re-coating.\n\nThe chamber can apply coatings of different reflective materials alone or in\ncombinations. It took a lot of work to determine the perfect coating for\nreflectivity and durability. Researchers tested different coatings on a steel\nstand-in mirror.\n\nThe first layer was an adhesive layer of nickel-chromium. Next came an\nincredibly thin layer of silver weighing only 64 grams spread over the\n8.4-meter mirror. On top of that, another nickel-chromium adhesive layer, then\na protective layer of silicon nitride to shield the reflective layer.\n\nThe person in charge of these precision coatings is Tomislav Vucina, the\nSenior Coating Engineer. Vucina describes the coatings as a balancing act.\n\u201cThis outer layer needs to be thick enough that it\u2019s not worn off by\ncleaning,\u201d said Vucina, \u201cbut not so thick that it absorbs too many photons and\nprevents the mirror from meeting Rubin\u2019s scientific requirements.\u201d\n\nThis image shows the Rubin Observatory\u2019s 8.4-meter combined primary/tertiary\nmirror after being coated with protected silver in April 2024. The reflective\ncoating was applied using the observatory\u2019s onsite coating chamber, which will\nalso be used to re-coat the mirror as necessary during Rubin\u2019s 10-year Legacy\nSurvey of Space and Time.

Now that the glass has received its\nreflective silver coating, it\u2019s truly a mirror.\n\nThe application process took only 4.5 hours, nothing compared to the 7 years\nrequired to build the primary/tertiary mirror. Vucina and his team subjected\nthe mirror to a battery of tests: reflectivity, adhesion, pinhole, and\ncosmetic. According to Vucina, the application process was successful.\n\n\u201cThis was a very well-conducted project from every angle,\u201d said Vucina,\n\u201cthanks to a combination of careful planning and the technical skills of our\nexcellent team.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a long road to completion for the VRO. But after a long wait, first\nlight is rapidly approaching. Excitement and anticipation for the\nobservatory\u2019s unique and powerful scientific contribution is growing. Its main\noutput is the decade-long Legacy Survey of Space and Time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re extremely excited that both mirrors are now coated and will be\ninstalled on the telescope very soon,\u201d said Sandrine Thomas, Deputy Director\nfor Rubin Construction. \u201cThe combined reflectivity of these mirrors will\nenable Rubin to detect very faint and far-away objects, leading to great\nscience!\u201d\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nCategoriesAstronomy\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
