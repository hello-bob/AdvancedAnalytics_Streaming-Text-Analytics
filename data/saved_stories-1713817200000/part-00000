We assist with every point in the supply chain:\nassessing needs, gathering supplies at home or from in-kind donors,\ncoordinating shipments, and advising on distributions. We currently send\nseveral regular shipments each month to multiple destinations and handle\nspecialty/emergency response shipments as well.\n\n### COVID-19 Response\n\nEurope & USA\n\nDistribute Aid is actively working to prevent the spread of COVID-19 globally.\nWe regularly send hygiene and PPE shipments to our European partners who\ncontinue to work to protect people in crowded refugee camps. Because COVID-19\naffects everybody, our response grew as the virus spread. We now also\ncollaborate with multiple grassroots networks in the US to support their\nresponse.\n\n### In-kind Donations\n\nGlobal\n\nDistribute Aid runs a successful in-kind donation programme where we connect\ncompanies with aid organisations. Through our network of hundreds of\ncharities, we can handle coordinating large volumes of donations. To date, we\nhave secured over 5 million items through our in-kind donor programme. Email\ndonate-aid@distributeaid.org if you can donate in-kind.\n\n### Fort Pickett\n\nUSA\n\nDistribute Aid was officially invited to join Operation Allies Welcome at Fort\nPickett in November. Our role on base is to manage all the donated aid. We\nwork with NGOs and departments across the base to assess the needs of our\nguests, and work with the community of external organizations supporting the\nOperation Allies Welcome mission to help facilitate aid deliveries. Once aid\narrives on base we work with the US Marines to distribute items to guests, and\nsupply materials for NGOs running education & activity programs to use in\ntheir classes. In November & December, our efforts resulted in more than\n750,000 items being distributed to or used by 7,500 guests at Fort Pickett.\nYou can support our work by donating to us through our Open Collective page!\n\n## July 2021\u2014June 2022 in numbers\n\nRead more in our latest annual report.\n\n32\n\nshipments\n\n1,117,000\n\nneeds met\n\n\u20ac6,124,150\n\nvalue to end-beneficiary\n\n$14,730,500\n\nretail value (based on USA GDP)\n\n96,500 km\n\ntraveled\n\n202,000 kg\n\nshipped\n\n4,400,000\n\nitems shipped\n\n142\n\norganizations worked with\n\n40\n\nactive team members\n\nDonate\n\nEmail us at hello@distributeaid.org(opens in your email client)\n\n", "frontpage": false}
