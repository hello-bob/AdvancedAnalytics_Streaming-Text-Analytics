Now It\u2019s Losing Thousands of Them.\n\nThe \u201cTexas Miracle\u201d loses some of its magic as Oracle announces it\u2019s moving\nits new HQ out of Austin and Tesla lays off nearly 2,700 workers.\n\nBy Christopher Hooks\n\nChristopher Hooks\n\nChristopher Hooks writes mostly about Texas politics and occasionally about\nmore serious subjects.\n\nView Articles\n\n  * Email\n  * RSS\n\nApril 26, 2024 0\n\nThe Oracle headquarters on April 24, 2024, in Austin. Brandon Bell/Getty\n\nBack in the halcyon days of 2020, a year we all remember fondly, a new flash\npoint opened in the enduring war between Texas and California. Technologists\nstarted picking up sticks in Taxifornia and moving to the Lone Star State in\ngreater numbers. The enemy\u2019s chief newspaper, the Los Angeles Times, worried\nthat Silicon Valley\u2019s \u201cmonopoly\u201d was over and wondered if Austin was \u201cthe\nfuture.\u201d Governor Greg Abbott declared Texas was \u201ctruly the land of business,\njobs, and opportunity.\u201d\n\nIn the wave of stories about Austin\u2019s ascension in 2020, there were always two\npieces of evidence given top billing. That year the tech goliath Oracle\nrelocated its HQ to Austin, where it had already built a massive campus on the\nsouth shore of Town Lake, and Elon Musk began building a gargantuan Cybertruck\nfactory just outside the city. Austin-area authorities helped Oracle secure\nvaluable lakefront real estate and offered Tesla some $60 million in tax\nabatements, including $50 million from the historically struggling school\ndistrict in Del Valle. The new facilities were greeted by state officials as\nevidence that the \u201cTexas Miracle\u201d was alive and well. Abbott proudly\nproclaimed last year that Austin was \u201cTHE destination for the world\u2019s leading\ntech companies.\u201d\n\nThis week saw a major plot twist in that narrative: Oracle declared it was\nmoving its headquarters to Nashville, and Tesla\u2014the largest private employer\nin the capital city\u2014announced it would be laying off almost 2,700 workers from\nits Austin plant after a disappointing earnings report. Texas wasn\u2019t really at\nfault here. Oracle, which makes business software, cited Nashville\u2019s strength\nas a center of the American health-care industry, though it surely also helps\nthat the company is getting nearly a quarter of a billion dollars in tax\nbreaks and incentives from the city and the state of Tennessee. Tesla,\nmeanwhile, laid off workers across the country after the Cybertruck suffered\nsignificant quality issues that put the future of its Austin production\nfacility in doubt. The city\u2019s debut in auto manufacturing is a vehicle that\napparently rusts in the rain. The factory complex, which Musk once promised\nwould become an \u201cecological paradise,\u201d recently took advantage of a new state\nlaw to exempt itself from Austin\u2019s environmental regulations.\n\n### Popular Videos\n\nThe Story: Writer Katy Vine on \"The Positively True Adventures of the Kilgore\nRangerette\u2013Kidnapping Mom\"\n\nMore Videos\n\n0 seconds of 47 secondsVolume 0%\n\nPress shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcuts\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\n\nShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?\n\nPlay/PauseSPACE\n\nIncrease Volume\u2191\n\nDecrease Volume\u2193\n\nSeek Forward\u2192\n\nSeek Backward\u2190\n\nCaptions On/Offc\n\nFullscreen/Exit Fullscreenf\n\nMute/Unmutem\n\nDecrease Caption Size-\n\nIncrease Caption Size+ or =\n\nSeek %0-9\n\nNext Up\n\nThe Story: Writer Sarah Hepola on \"What Cheer Led To\"\n\n01:13\n\nLive\n\n00:00\n\n00:47\n\n00:47\n\nThe Story: Writer Katy Vine on \"The Positively True Adventures of the Kilgore\nRangerette\u2013Kidnapping Mom\"\n\nmore\n\n#### The Story: Writer Katy Vine on \"The Positively True Adventures of the\nKilgore Rangerette\u2013Kidnapping Mom\"\n\nmore\n\n#### The Story: Writer Sarah Hepola on \"What Cheer Led To\"\n\nmore\n\n#### Go Inside Each 'Shane & Sally' Episode with Behind-the-Scenes Footage and\nCommentary\n\nmore\n\n#### We Test More Classic Texas Recipes in Season 2 of Texas Dinner Party\n\nmore\n\n#### This Texas Teen is a Skateboarding Sensation\n\nmore\n\n#### Go Into the Shop with Wimberley Woodworker Philip Morley\n\nmore\n\n#### The Best Mexico City Street Tacos in Austin\n\nmore\n\n#### Harper Watters is a Boundary-Breaking Ballet Star\n\nmore\n\n#### The Mother-Son Team Behind Houston's Most Colorful Art\n\nmore\n\n#### The Story: Writer Michael Hall on \"The Juror Who Found Herself Guilty\"\n\nmore\n\n#### Team USA Boxing Captain Ginny Fuchs is a Fighter\n\nmore\n\n#### Tour the Number One Barbecue Joint in Texas\n\nmore\n\n#### Linda Pace's Penthouse Is An Art Collector\u2019s Dream\n\nmore\n\n#### After the Big Year: A South Texan\u2019s Wild, Life-affirming Birding\nAdventure\n\nmore\n\n#### Dottie and Ed: A Love Story Mixed Up in Time\n\nmore\n\n#### Texas Music Legends Look Back on Floore\u2019s Country Store\n\nmore\n\n#### The Story: Writer John Spong on \"Six Brothers\"\n\nBut while hard financial realities explain the HQ move and the layoffs, the\nnews also evidences a moment of cultural change: the sudden hotness Austin\nenjoyed in 2020 has dissipated, at least a bit, into notness. In the mad\nsummer of 2020, tech evangelist Joe Lonsdale wrote that Texas stood as a new\nfrontier in the fight for human freedom and vowed to build a new city outside\nAustin to serve as a safe haven for disruptors, like other utopians who have\nbeen coming to the state for centuries. But, it turned out, after the COVID-19\npandemic, there was more utility in the status quo. When in-person work came\nback, rubbing shoulders in Palo Alto became more valuable to tech leaders. And\nwhile Lonsdale remains, many members of his tribe started heading home.\n\n### Read Next\n\n### Californians Could Ruin Texas\u2014But Not the Way You Might Think\n\nBy Christopher Hooks\n\n### The Case for More Californians\n\nBy Ben Rowen\n\nIn December, perhaps not coincidentally after Austin\u2019s most miserably hot\nsummer ever, TechCrunch wrote that start-ups were fleeing the city, which was\n\u201closing its luster.\u201d Not surprisingly, some of the Californians who moved here\nduring the pandemic realized they had traded Edenic weather for 110-degree\nsummers and no income tax, and they decided that the income tax wasn\u2019t that\nbad. That was reflected in the tech industry\u2019s financials. Venture capitalists\ninvested $6.75 billion in Austin start-ups in 2021, but in 2023 they invested\nonly $3.8 billion. (Funding also fell in Palo Alto amid an industry-wide\ncrunch, but the Bay Area remained king by far, with companies there raising\nmore than $60 billion in investment in 2023.)\n\nOracle\u2019s decision to move its HQ out of Texas after less than four years is a\nreminder that trying to lasso global companies is like trying to wrestle the\nwind, and that the economic-development incentives that were so vaunted here\nearlier this century can only do so much. Austin will most likely continue to\ngrow, of course, but the end of this particular hype cycle coincides with a\nground shift in the state\u2019s political identity.\n\nFor the first two decades of the century, what it meant to be Texan\u2014as\nexplained by the state\u2019s politicians\u2014was largely wrapped up in a feeling of\ncompetition with California. The state\u2019s \u201cwins\u201d were often counted by how many\nnew residents and companies Texas could induce to move here from the Golden\nState.\n\nGovernor Rick Perry was the main figure associated with this contest: he\nbragged endlessly about the deals he had struck with CEOs from colder and more\nheavily income-taxed states, and even about the rising price of in-demand\nU-Haul rentals from San Francisco to Dallas. He took credit for the growth of\nthe Texas economy, the primary accomplishment of his fourteen-year stretch in\noffice. Abbott picked up the baton, and Senator Ted Cruz has sought to share\nin the glory. The political culture of the state was oriented around\nattracting newcomers at any cost, even if the effort got a little ridiculous.\n\nIn 2014, the producer of the hip Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce, Huy Fong Foods, got\ninto trouble with the local authorities in Irwindale, California, near Los\nAngeles. The problem: residents said the roasted chile fumes from the factory\nwere giving their eyes and throats hell, and the city sued the company to try\nto make it curb its emissions. (The company denied responsibility and hung a\nbanner outside its headquarters reading, \u201cNo tear gas made here,\u201d but air-\nquality regulators promised to investigate.) \u201c[That] would not happen in\nTexas,\u201d said then\u2013state representative Jason Villalba, a moderate Republican\nfrom the Dallas area. He led a delegation of Texas lawmakers\u2014two state\nrepresentatives, a state senator, and officials from the governor\u2019s office,\nthe attorney general\u2019s office, and the Texas Department of Agriculture\u2014to beg\nHuy Fong to relocate to some part of Texas where the residents would be\ngrateful.\n\nThe delegation did not succeed: the factory\u2019s owner used the Texans as\nleverage to negotiate with California authorities and sent both groups\npacking. Nearly every statewide politician in the Lone Star State, however,\nagreed that this kind of effort was valiant, even as theater: the state\u2019s role\nwas to encourage new businesses and new folks to move here, even if the\ntransplants inspired grumpy jokes.\n\nThat belief has dissipated. The right wing in Texas has changed how state\nofficials view newcomers and the very prospect of economic growth. That shift\naccelerated at the start of the pandemic, when hostility to Californians and\ntransplants had become more commonly expressed by Texas politicians.\nRepublicans are now just as likely to promise to protect Texas from\nCalifornians as to celebrate winning them over. At a rally this spring, Perry\nnoted that Texans frequently approach him to blame him\u2014even if jokingly\u2014for\nall the out-of-staters they have to deal with now. Last Friday, the Republican\nParty of Texas (run by a transplant from Connecticut) sent a fund-raising\nappeal that began with the declaration that \u201cJoe Biden is flooding Texas with\nmigrants & Californians.\u201d\n\nThis generation of Republican leaders, most prominently Lieutenant Governor\nDan Patrick\u2014himself a transplant from Baltimore\u2014is less prone to seeing\neconomic growth as a goal in and of itself. The state GOP has grown\nincreasingly skeptical of business interests, which often favor moderate\nRepublicans and a timid approach to the culture wars. When Rick Perry left\noffice, the Legislature kneecapped his most treasured economic development:\nslush funds.\n\nRecent sessions saw a prolonged fight over the future of the Chapter 313 tax-\nincentive program, created in 2001, which authorized property tax breaks to\ninduce large businesses to relocate here. The Legislature allowed the program\nto expire in 2022 and then revived it in a new and shrunken form that went\ninto effect this year. While Abbott blamed the loss of a major semiconductor\nplant to New York on the lapse of the program, Patrick was quite proud of the\ndeath of Chapter 313, which he said had been \u201cmisused.\u201d\n\nMore than just the mood of the Legislature has changed. While many Texans\ndon\u2019t like Californians, those who use the word as a curse are generally using\nit to describe all newcomers, much like those who call brown migrants\n\u201cMexicans.\u201d Though no polling will tell you so, and though those who are angry\nabout newcomers may not themselves make the connection, there\u2019s a good case to\nbe made that the fear of both Latin American migrants and American transplants\ncomes from a general sense of economic instability. Texas overall has gotten\nmuch wealthier this century. But that wealth has been distributed unevenly.\nThe cost of living in the state\u2019s cities has skyrocketed: home prices have\nrisen faster in Austin than in Los Angeles this century, according to Federal\nReserve data. In the last decade, housing prices in DFW more than doubled,\nwhile the median income only rose 45 percent. Chicago is now a better bet for\nwould-be homeowners.\n\nMeanwhile, Texas is not a low-tax, low-service state, as is commonly held.\nIt\u2019s a high-tax, low-service state: we may have no income tax, but at least\none study found that we have one of the ten highest total tax burdens in the\nnation, with property taxes making up most of the gap. The quality of state\nservices, however, has not improved commensurate with the growth of state\nbudgets. Older Texans feel squeezed in cities where they\u2019ve lived for decades.\nYounger Texans go to too-often substandard schools, receive substandard health\ncare, and then can\u2019t afford homes in the cities of their birth. Texas politics\nhas increasingly focused on managing the resulting resentment, and the easiest\nway to do so is to blame outsiders.\n\nBut that puts state leaders in a bind. The state\u2019s economic model is dependent\non cheap migrant labor, skilled workers from out of state, and the regular\ninfusion of new capital. Transplants are twice as likely as native Texans to\nhave a bachelor\u2019s degree. They live in homes built by, and eat at restaurants\nstaffed by, undocumented migrants. The growth that results helps everyone, but\nit benefits some much more than others. \u201cAll boats rise,\u201d Steven Pedigo, a\nprofessor at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at\nAustin, told Texas Monthly in 2021, \u201cbut not all boats rise enough and rise\nfast enough\u201d to account for rising costs of living. So even in the good times,\nyou have burgeoning resentment. Problems accruing from the population surge go\nunaddressed as the Legislature stumbles from budget surplus to budget surplus.\n\nSmarter anti-immigration conservatives make the case that by using foreign\nlabor to solve America\u2019s skilled-labor shortages, the country stifles the\nprocess by which native Americans might be trained up to meet skilled-labor\ndemand. We import doctors and engineers because it\u2019s cheaper than training our\nown. Whether that\u2019s true or not, Texas is doing something similar with\n\u201cCalifornians.\u201d The state stinks at developing its own labor force. And why\nshould we bother when we can poach workers from other states? But no boom\nlasts forever, and Oracle\u2019s departure is a reminder that folks can move in\nboth directions. What happens when the influx slows\u2014and we\u2019re left with our\nown atrophied mechanisms for generating growth? Well, we can do what Americans\nhave always done. We can hitch the U-Haul to the Cybertruck and hit the road.\n\n  * More About:\n  * Politics & Policy\n  * Business\n  * Rick Perry\n  * Greg Abbott\n  * Austin\n\n### Read Next\n\n  * \u201cThis Would Have Been a Peaceful Gathering\u201d: Behind the Scenes of the UT Protest\n  * What the Bleep Is Going On With Texas Home Insurance?\n  * The Far Right Has Proposed a Twelve-Point Plan to Make the Texas House More Extreme\n  * A Lonely Man, a Bizarre Billboard, and a Quest for Everlasting Love\n  * Thousands of Old Wind Turbine Blades Pile Up in West Texas\n  * What Is Alex Jones Doing in This Tiny Far West Texas Town?\n\n  * Home\n  * Share on Facebook\n  * Share on Twitter\n  * Email a link to this page\n  * Comments 0\n  * Share on Pinterest\n\n## Recommended\n\nPolitics & Policy\n\n### \u201cThis Would Have Been a Peaceful Gathering\u201d: Behind the Scenes of the UT\nProtest\n\nBy Aaron Boehmer\n\nStyle & Design\n\n### Hotel Herringbone Is Bringing a Bit of the Vegas Strip to Waco\n\nBy Amanda Albee\n\nPolitics & Policy\n\n### The Far Right Has Proposed a Twelve-Point Plan to Make the Texas House\nMore Extreme\n\nBy Alexandra Samuels\n\nPolitics & Policy\n\n### What the Bleep Is Going On With Texas Home Insurance?\n\nBy Michael Hardy\n\nEnergy\n\n### Permian Producers Will Pay You to Haul Their Natural Gas Away\n\nBy Russell Gold\n\nPolitics & Policy\n\n### When a Defendant Gets Lost in Translation\n\nBy Sasha von Oldershausen\n\n## Get All Our Stories in One Daily Email\n\nIt\u2019s free.
