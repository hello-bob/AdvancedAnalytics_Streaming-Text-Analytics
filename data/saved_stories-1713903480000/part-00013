Mullen\n\n# America\u2019s Public Bible\n\n## A Commentary\n\nDown arrow\n\nThroughout the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century, newspapers\nin the United States\u2014even newspapers which were not published by a religious\ndenomination or organization\u2014made frequent recourse to the Bible. Newspapers\nprinted sermons and Sunday school lessons. They featured jokes whose\npunchlines required familiarity with the Bible and aired political commentary\nthat cited the Bible on all sides of a given issue.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Public Bible is an interactive scholarly work that uncovers the\nhistory of the Bible in the nineteenth- and early twentieth-century United\nStates. When the Bible was cited on one side or the other of an issue, only\nrarely was its meaning explicated rather than assumed. Those who cited the\ntext most typically thought that their readers would understand its meaning\nprecisely as they did. But the multiple and mutually exclusive ways in which\nnewspapers used the Bible test that assumption. By identifying and studying\nquotations in American newspapers, the site offers a commentary on how the\nBible was used in public life, uncovering trends and patterns that would be\ninvisible to a single scholar\u2019s reading of these documents.\n\nThis publication was developed at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and\nNew Media.\n\nDown arrow\n\nLincoln A.
