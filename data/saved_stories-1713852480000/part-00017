Specialized hardware is\n> often necessary to meet the performance requirements of state-of-the-art DL\n> models, but the rapid pace of change in DL models and the wide variety of\n> systems integrating DL make it impossible to create custom computer chips\n> for all but the largest markets. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)\n> present a unique blend of reprogrammability and direct hardware execution\n> that make them suitable for accelerating DL inference. They offer the\n> ability to customize processing pipelines and memory hierarchies to achieve\n> lower latency and higher energy efficiency compared to general-purpose CPUs\n> and GPUs, at a fraction of the development time and cost of custom chips.\n> Their diverse high-speed IOs also enable directly interfacing the FPGA to\n> the network and/or a variety of external sensors, making them suitable for\n> both datacenter and edge use cases. As DL has become an ever more important\n> workload, FPGA architectures are evolving to enable higher DL performance.\n> In this article, we survey both academic and industrial FPGA architecture\n> enhancements for DL. First, we give a brief introduction on the basics of\n> FPGA architecture and how its components lead to strengths and weaknesses\n> for DL applications. Next, we discuss different styles of DL inference\n> accelerators on FPGA, ranging from model-specific dataflow styles to\n> software-programmable overlay styles. We survey DL-specific enhancements to\n> traditional FPGA building blocks such as logic blocks, arithmetic circuitry,\n> and on-chip memories, as well as new in-fabric DL-specialized blocks for\n> accelerating tensor computations. Finally, we discuss hybrid devices that\n> combine processors and coarse-grained accelerator blocks with FPGA-like\n> interconnect and networks-on-chip, and highlight promising future research\n> directions.\n\nSubjects:| Hardware Architecture (cs.AR)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.10076 [cs.AR]  \n(or arXiv:2404.10076v1 [cs.AR] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.10076arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Andrew Boutros [view email] [v1] Mon, 15 Apr 2024 18:28:10 UTC (1,975\nKB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Field-Programmable Gate Array Architecture for\nDeep Learning: Survey & Future Directions, by Andrew Boutros and 2 other\nauthors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.AR\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
