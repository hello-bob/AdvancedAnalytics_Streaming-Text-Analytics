The -O3 optimization\nlevel is what upstream Python uses for its release builds and is proven that\n\"it makes Python significantly faster\" across a range of benchmarks/workloads.\nOn a geo mean basis this makes Fedora's Python around 4% faster while some\nindividual benchmarks see much more significant improvements.\n\nThe change proposal is summed up as:\n\n> \"Faster Python, faster Fedora.\"\n\nFESCo has approved the -O3 optimization level change for Python to happen with\nthe in-development Fedora 41.\n\n4 Comments\n\nTweet\n\nRelated News\n\nFedora Evaluates Replacing Redis With Valkey\n\nFedora Miracle Spin Proposed For Fedora 41\n\nFedora Linux 40 Available For Download As A Wonderful Upgrade\n\nFedora Linux 40 Cleared For Release Next Week\n\nRPM 4.20 Approved For Fedora 41 To Advance Hands-Free Packaging\n\nFedora 41 Aims For More Reproducible Package Builds Thanks To A Rust Program\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
