Abolition Is the\nSolution.\n\nBacked by research, more public health advocates are opposing projects that\nharm rather than heal their communities.\n\nBy\n\n    Cristian Farias ,\n    Truthout/Inquest\n\nPublished\n\n    April 23, 2024\n\nIf jails, prisons and detention centers are death-making by nature, then it\nfollows that the public\u2019s health is ill served by continuing to invest in\ncarceral structures that make people and their communities sick.Getty Images\n\n#### Part of the Series\n\n##### Abolition in Action\n\nIn Body and Soul, a pathbreaking examination of the Black Panther Party\u2019s\nabiding commitment to health activism, Alondra Nelson recounts how Bobby\nSeale, Huey Newton, and other party leaders came to prioritize the pursuit of\nhealth and healing as vital to their survival \u2014 in more ways than one. As the\nPanthers\u2019 reputation for armed resistance to police violence and demands for a\nsociety that left no Black or poor people behind grew in the public eye, so\ndid their criminalization, incarceration, surveillance and even death at the\nhands of state actors. Combined with disenchantment with the insufficient\ncivil rights gains of the 1960s, evident in the enduring precarity of the so-\ncalled war on poverty, the party bolstered its focus on a key aspect of its\nplatform: their people\u2019s health. Serving the people, body and soul, became\never more central to the Panthers\u2019 organizing, message and the future they\nwished to see.\n\nUnderstanding this \u201crevised narrative\u201d of the Panthers, as Nelson calls it,\nhelps us understand how the party went on to establish, among other\nimperatives, a nationwide network of free-for-all health clinics \u2014 the\nPeople\u2019s Free Medical Clinics. In these \u201calternative healthcare facilities,\u201d\npatients were offered care at no cost, found safety from medical\ndiscrimination, received political education, and had other needs met by\ntrusted health experts and laypeople alike. Importantly, the Panthers\nrecognized that social health \u2014 that is, the community\u2019s broader well-being \u2014\ncalled for more than simply health care access. \u201cLocal residents could receive\nassistance from a \u2018patient advocate\u2019 \u2014 a Party member or volunteer \u2014 on such\nmatters as physical health, housing issues, and legal aid,\u201d Nelson writes. \u201cIn\nthis way, the clinics were also bases of operation for the Panthers\u2019 wider\n\u2018serve the people\u2019 agenda.\u201d Like the Panthers\u2019 free breakfast for kids\nprogram, the clinics were both sites of service and a way of doing politics by\nother means.\n\nThe Black Panthers did not speak the language of abolition the way prison and\npolice abolitionists speak it today. Neither were they trained public health\npractitioners in the traditional, institutional sense. The opposite is true:\nThe nation\u2019s long history of medical mistreatment of Black and marginalized\npeople, and the Panthers\u2019 own reservations about the medical establishment,\nturned them into health intermediaries \u2014 a bridge between allied medical\nprofessionals and community members, whose lived experiences and insights into\ntheir own condition were deemed just as valuable.\n\nPointing to this record of community care, Zahra Khan, Yoshiko Iwai and\nSayantani DasGupta have placed the Panthers\u2019 model within a tradition of \u201ccare\nstructures that have historically operated at the margins.\u201d Like the Young\nLords in the 1960s and \u201870s, who likewise saw the health of Puerto Ricans in\nthe Bronx as integral to their collective survival, these revolutionaries\u2019\nhealth activism and organizing serves as a model today for a new generation of\nabolitionist public health workers, academics, students, researchers,\ncommunity organizers and allied medical professionals. Together, these\nadvocates strive to take a broad view of what constitutes the public\u2019s health\n\u2014 and the need to disentangle it from the practices that feed mass\nincarceration.\n\n\u201cThere are powerful traditions and lineages to build on and learn from, and\nthere is much to be gained by studying about these lineages as we struggle\ntogether,\u201d Maria Thomas, an organizer with Interrupting Criminalization\u2019s\nBeyond Do No Harm initiative, wrote in the Forge in September.\n\n### Related Story\n\nOp-Ed\n\n|\n\nPrisons & Policing\n\n## Abolition Is a Project of Human Liberation That Must Be Ongoing\n\nLet\u2019s amplify the efforts already in progress to demolish the prison\nindustrial complex and move toward liberation.\n\nBy\n\n    Rachel Herzing ,\n    Justin Pich\u00e9 ,\n    Maya Schenwar ,\n    Truthout/Inquest\n\nApril 18, 2024\n\nTruthout\n\nBeyond Do No Harm, whose overarching goal is to end the criminalization of\npatients while they\u2019re seeking care, is but one network from a growing list of\norganizations that want the field of public health to be in firm alliance with\nthe movement to end the harms of policing and prisons. Whether formal or\ninformal, these alliances are already taking root. From Los Angeles to\nKentucky to Atlanta, more and more advocates are adopting abolitionist\nframeworks, backed by public health research and medical expertise, as they\noppose projects that would harm rather than heal their communities.\n\nAt its core, abolitionist public health sees carceral institutions and\npractices as antithetical to public health. If jails, prisons and detention\ncenters are death-making by nature, as abolitionist leader Mariame Kaba has\nfamously observed, then it follows that the public\u2019s health is ill served by\ncontinuing to invest in carceral structures that make people and their\ncommunities sick, as abundant research has shown.\n\nYet traditional public health has been slow to catch on to this reality, in\npart because for much of its history, the field has acted as the eyes and ears\nof the state in health care settings. Many people in this space \u2014 which\nencompasses government, academic, nonprofit and private sectors \u2014 have told me\nthat the field of public health, despite recent advances, remains conservative\nand connected to systems of coercion and control. \u201cPublic health is a tool of\nthe state to maintain order,\u201d Bita Amani, a social epidemiologist at Charles\nDrew University\u2019s Department of Urban Public Health, told me in an interview.\nIn her work, Amani takes the long view of U.S. public health, which she says\narose to compensate for the absence of socialized, universal health care in\nthe United States and other public measures that keep people healthy.\n\nThis form of organized abandonment, which has been filled with the\ncorporatized, commodified health care system that exists today, has resulted\nin a medical profession that lacks training in social medicine \u2014 a glaring\nomission that helps explain why health care settings, especially in areas\nwhere the need is greatest, have become enmeshed with other systems of social\ncontrol. Indeed, public health institutions have a record of being complicit,\nif not willing participants, in treating public health problems with carceral\ninterventions. From the drug war to the crisis of gun violence to the\nmanagement of COVID-19, the threat of punishment and incarceration remains a\nfavored tool to ensure compliance. Until recently, even migrants were subject\nto swift deportation thanks to a public health emergency measure supposedly\nintended to prevent the spread of communicable disease.\n\nAbolitionists in public health have been working to stem this tide. The End\nPolice Violence Collective, which organized members of the American Public\nHealth Association (APHA) to draft and adopt a policy statement naming the\nharms of carceral systems as a public health crisis, had to work hard behind\nthe scenes to educate skeptics that abolition and public health are, in\neffect, two sides of the same coin. \u201cFar from destruction,\u201d the collective\nwrote for Inquest in 2022, \u201cabolition is about disrupting systems that create\nor compound harm, while establishing or reinforcing health-affirming ones in\ntheir stead \u2014 ultimately creating a world where people have what they need to\nlive healthy and safe lives in their communities.\u201d\n\nThe APHA statement has become an advocacy and organizing tool of its own.\nAdvocates in New York City have cited it to push for public health approaches\nto violence prevention. In Ohio the statement has been used in policy analysis\nto uplift the health benefits of moving away from pretrial incarceration in\nthe state. In Texas a policy brief for the city of San Antonio advanced public\nsafety solutions outside of arrest and incarceration, relying on the APHA\nstatement for its recommendations. And in Massachusetts multiple organizations\nsigned statements or letters of support citing the statement, calling on the\nlegislature to pass a bill imposing a moratorium on new prison and jail\nconstruction projects. (A pre-2020 APHA statement naming police violence as a\npublic health issue did not raise abolition as a solution, but the George\nFloyd uprisings gave organizers an opening with APHA voting members the second\ntime around.)\n\nWithin the U.S. government, the World Health Organization (WHO), and state and\nlocal public health authorities, there is widespread acceptance that\npreventing disease and death by addressing the \u201csocial determinants of health\u201d\nis a cornerstone of public health. These determinants, which can mean the\nworld to people who lack them, include economic resources to meet everyday\nneeds, such as nutritious food, housing and transportation; quality education\nand job training; access to health care; clean air, water and access to public\nspaces; and an environment free of state violence. Failing to fund these\npriorities, the thinking goes, leads to failed societies. \u201cSocial injustice,\u201d\nthe WHO Commission on the Social Determinants of Health noted in a 2008\nreport, \u201cis killing people on a grand scale.\u201d\n\nDespite this knowledge base, federal, state and local governments\u2019 investments\nin policing and prisons continue to outpace social welfare programs. Yet\nsocial welfare programs have been shown to prevent criminalization, contacts\nwith the criminal legal system and reincarceration. And public health spending\nin particular, by one measure, accounts for a measly 1 percent of all health\ncare spending in the United States.\n\nAt the instructional level, meanwhile, public health education isn\u2019t quite\nmoving the needle. Writing in Health Education and Behavior, a group of former\nand current public health students from different institutions contended that\npublic health education does not interrogate the underpinnings of what\nabolitionists call the prison-industrial complex, let alone its public health\nimpacts or how the field is routinely in cahoots with carceral actors. Maya\nTalwar-Hebert, a graduate student and organizer at the Columbia Mailman School\nof Public Health, echoed some of these critiques when asked if her school\noffered an abolitionist curriculum to support her own work. \u201cThe school seems\nto recognize policing and incarceration as public health problems, but remains\ncommitted to reformist frameworks to address them,\u201d she wrote in an emailed\nresponse.\n\nCarlos Martinez, who teaches at UC Santa Cruz and co-edited the forthcoming\ncollection All of This Safety Is Killing Us: Health Justice Beyond Prisons,\nPolice, and Borders, noted that there\u2019s a tendency in public health\ninstruction to remain \u201cindividualist\u201d \u2014 placing the onus on individuals rather\nthan systems to improve health outcomes. \u201cThe way that public health is taught\nin most programs continues to be focused on individual behavior change instead\nof systems change, even as concepts such as social determinants of health have\nentered the mainstream,\u201d Martinez said in an email. He pointed to a study\nshowing how public health textbooks, almost without exception, are framed\naround \u201cbehavioral fundamentalism\u201d \u2014 the idea that health is guided by\nbehavior and personal choices rather than social, structural or systemic\nfactors.\n\nHuman Impact Partners (HIP), in Berkeley, California, is an organization with\nits finger on the pulse of all these conversations around the intersection of\npublic health and abolition. Its mission is to transform the field of public\nhealth from the ground up. By centering equity and building collective power\nwith social justice movements, the organization envisions a future where\neveryone has everything they need to thrive, and where public health \u201cupholds\npolicies, practices, and systems to ensure health and well-being for those who\nneed it most.\u201d\n\nHIP does this work in a number of ways. A capacity-building team works with\ngovernmental public health organizations, like the National Association of\nCity and County Health Officials, leading trainings and providing technical\nassistance on how to center racial justice and health equity in their work. A\nbridging team connects these officials to community-building organizations, to\nhelp them align their goals and practices. And a policy and organizing team\nsupplies grassroots organizations with research support for their policy and\nbudget campaigns. \u201cI think of what we do as providing community orgs with\nanother tool in their toolkit as they are running their campaign,\u201d Christine\nMitchell, who leads HIP\u2019s Health Instead of Punishment Program, told me.\n\nAs Mitchell recounts HIP\u2019s history, the organization wasn\u2019t always explicitly\nabolitionist, opting instead for partnering with others who wore the label.\nBut in 2019 its leaders decided that it was time to be open about it, because\nthere weren\u2019t \u2014 and still aren\u2019t \u2014 many organizations in the public health\nrealm that are explicitly abolitionist. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of a little niche that we\nwere able to fill,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cI think we see abolition as fitting very\nneatly into the mission of public health \u2014 that abolition is a public health\nstrategy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are lucky to have funders that don\u2019t see that as a problem,\u201d she added.\n\nOne campaign that has benefited from HIP\u2019s expertise is the ongoing push to\nclose the last two women\u2019s prisons in California. Together with its partners,\nthe California Coalition for Women Prisoners (CCWP), as well as Californians\nUnited for a Responsible Budget and the Transgender, Gender-Variant, and\nIntersex Justice Project, HIP developed a report, backed by extensive public\nhealth research, laying out the lasting harms of women\u2019s prisons \u2014 and the\nneed to invest in materially supporting the people directly impacted by them.\nMitchell said that currently and formerly incarcerated people who have been\ncaged in the prisons targeted by the campaign took part in both the\nqualitative and the quantitative research that went into the report, and HIP\nensured that its framing uplifted their stories and experiences.\n\nThis approach is not unlike what the Black Panthers did by allowing everyday\npeople to claim their own expertise and take an active role in shaping their\nown conceptions of health, creating valuable knowledge that others could use.\nNelson calls this the \u201cdemocratization of expertise.\u201d\n\nIn this vein, Jane Dorotik, a formerly incarcerated member of CCWP\u2019s\ncoordinating committee who spent 20 years in one of the prisons targeted for\nclosure, said she values the public health perspectives that HIP brings to\ntheir organizing, but also appreciates how her own expertise is valued. She\nrecalled a recent public health convening in the Bay Area, to which HIP\ninvited her as a panelist, and how the people in the room did not quite see\njails and prisons as harmful to public health. \u201cA lot of them don\u2019t\nnecessarily think of incarceration as a public health crisis,\u201d Dorotik, who\nhas a background in nursing, told me. \u201cAnd we have to start thinking that way\nso that we can turn things around.\u201d\n\nOnce a finished report sees the light of day, Mitchell said, HIP will remain\nengaged with the broader campaign \u2014 whether in the form of legislative\ntestimony, letter writing, or other support organizers may need. \u201cThe\npartnership doesn\u2019t end when the product is out,\u201d Mitchell said, contrasting\nit with how academic research tends to leave its subjects behind once the\nfindings are published.\n\nHIP is also cultivating future public health leaders through its Abolitionist\nPublic Health Student Network. Since the spring of 2022, a number of semester-\nlong \u201ccohorts\u201d from various schools have joined the network to learn and\norganize together, with the goal of building community, strategizing and\nstaying connected long after members have entered the workforce. Melina\nRodriguez, who attends the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health and organizes\nlocally with the Health Not Punishment Collective, told me in an email that\nthe network has served as a reminder that \u201cyou are not alone\u201d in work that\nsometimes can feel \u201cdaunting\u201d and \u201cheavy,\u201d in part due to what feels like\ninsufficient institutional support. \u201cI don\u2019t think that I would have started\nup Health Not Punishment Collective had it not been for this community that\ntaught me so much about how to do it, and served as a constant reminder that\nwe could do it,\u201d Rodriguez wrote.\n\nAmani, the social epidemiologist, told me that despite the many structural\nheadwinds U.S. public health and the broader health care system face, she\nfeels that the younger generations \u2014 the public health practitioners being\ntrained and entering the field today \u2014 are far more sophisticated and attuned\nto what needs to change. \u201cI don\u2019t know of any societal transformation,\nrevolution or major reform movement anywhere that did not have involvement of\npeople that were in public health and health,\u201d Amani said. Mitchell, for her\npart, says with a laugh that her hope is to live in a world where HIP is not\nneeded because people will have all their basic needs met. \u201cI want to work\nmyself out of a job,\u201d she said.\n\n##### Join us in defending the truth before it\u2019s too late\n\nThe future of independent journalism is uncertain, and the consequences of\nlosing it are too grave to ignore.
