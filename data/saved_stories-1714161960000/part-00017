While we already know a lot about the platform to power\nMicrosoft's new \"AI PCs,\" Qualcomm appears to be preparing even more.\nAccording to a new report from Android Authority, the company wants to release\none more Snapdragon X Plus SKU and even server variants of its new processors.\n\nAs of right now, Qualcomm officially unveiled four Snapdragon X processors:\nthree X1 Elite SKUs and one X1 Plus. However, there should be one more X1 Plus\nvariant with eight Oryon cores, fewer PCIe Gen 4 lanes, and less powerful\ngraphics. The SKU in question is X1P-42-100.\n\nInterestingly, Qualcomm is aiming at not just regular PCs, like the upcoming\nSurface Pro 10. The company reportedly works on server chips with Oryon cores.\nThe \"SD1\" chip allegedly features the following specs:\n\n>   * 80 Oryon cores at up to 3.8GHz\n>   * 16 channels of DDR5 up to 5600MHz\n>   * 70 PCIe 5.0 lanes\n>   * CXL v1.1 support\n>   * 9470-pin LGA socket (98.0\u00d795.0mm)\n>   * Support for a two-socket configuration\n>   * Built on TSMC\u2019s 5nm process (N5P)\n>\n\nAccording to the report, Qualcomm briefed its partners about its new server\nchip somewhere in late 2021 or early 2022. The SD1 could be Qualcomm's second\nattempt at server chips after the canceled Centriq in 2017.\n\nQualcomm has already provided the first benchmarks of its new Snapdragon X\nElite and Plus processors. They look on par with the modern competition, which\nbacks the recent report about Microsoft being confident in its AI PCs being\ncapable of outperforming Apple's M3-based MacBook Air.\n\nOf course, real-world tests and benchmarks will have to wait for the first\ndevices to hit the market, which should happen somewhere in mid-2024.\nMicrosoft, for example, plans to unveil the ARM-powered Surface Pro 10 and\nSurface Laptop 6 on May 20, 2024.\n\n#### Tags\n\n  * Qualcomm\n  * Snapdragon x\n  * Qualcomm snapdragon x\n  * Snapdragon x elite\n  * Snapdragon x plus\n  * Windows on arm\n  * Microsoft\n\nLike\n\nPost\n\nShare\n\nReport a problem with article\n\nNext Article\n\n### Download: Coding with AI For Dummies ($18 Value) eBook for FREE\n\nPrevious Article\n\n### Fallout 4 next-gen update is live with new render modes, Creation Club\ncontent, and more\n\n### Related Stories\n\n### Qualcomm unveils Snapdragon X Plus for Windows 11 ARM PCs\n\nTaras Buria \u00b7 Apr 24, 2024 with 9 comment s\n\n### Snapdragon X Elite and Plus specs leak ahead of official announcement\n\nTaras Buria \u00b7 Apr 23, 2024 with 3 comment s\n\n### The first renders of a Windows 11 laptop with the Snapdragon X Elite CPU\nmay have leaked\n\nJohn Callaham \u00b7 Apr 17, 2024 with 32 comment s\n\n### Qualcomm promises most Windows games will 'just work' on Snapdragon X\nElite\n\nTaras Buria \u00b7 Mar 22, 2024 with 12 comment s\n\nFrom the WebPowered by ZergNet\n\nWe Might Know Where Human Teeth Came From & We Can't Sleep Now\n\nDon't Throw Away Old Computer Parts.
