He spent his days in a park surrounded by the creatures\nthat mattered most to him\u2014pigeons\u2014and his sleepless nights ruminating on\nmathematical equations and scientific problems. He designed and perfected his\ninventions in his head, a habit that would confound scientists and scholars\nfor many years after his death.\n\nTesla believed his mind to be without equal, and he wasn\u2019t above chiding his\ncontemporaries, such as Thomas Edison, who once hired him. If Edison had a\nneedle to find in a haystack, Tesla once said, \u201che would not stop to reason\nwhere it was most likely to be, but would proceed at once, with the feverish\ndiligence of a bee, to examine straw after straw until he found the object of\nhis search.\u201d\n\nBut what his contemporaries may have been lacking in scientific talent (by\nTesla\u2019s estimation), they made up for in other ambitions. Inventors like\nEdison and George Westinghouse possessed one trait that Tesla did not: a mind\nfor business. In the last days of America\u2019s Gilded Age, Tesla made a dramatic\nattempt to change the future of communications and power transmission around\nthe world. He managed to convince J.P. Morgan that he was on the verge of a\nbreakthrough, and the financier gave Tesla more than $150,000 to fund what\nwould become a gigantic, futuristic and startling tower in the middle of Long\nIsland in New York. In 1898, as Tesla\u2019s plans to create a worldwide wireless\ntransmission system became known, Wardenclyffe Tower would be Tesla\u2019s last\nchance to claim the recognition and wealth that had always escaped him.\n\nA portrait of Tesla circa 1890 Public domain via Wikimedia Commons\n\n## The eccentric engineer\n\nNikola Tesla was born in modern-day Croatia in 1856. His mother, \u0110uka Tesla,\nwas a hard-working caretaker of their home and farm; she developed small\nappliances to ease her labor, including a mechanical eggbeater, and Tesla\nlater credited her for his inventiveness. His father, Milutin Tesla, was a\npriest of the Serbian Orthodox Church. From an early age, Nikola Tesla\ndemonstrated an obsessiveness that left those around him puzzled and amused.\nHe could memorize entire books and store logarithmic tables in his brain. He\npicked up languages easily, and he could work through days and nights on only\na few hours of sleep.\n\nBy age 19, he was studying electrical engineering at the Imperial and Royal\nTechnical College in Graz, Austria, where he quickly established himself as a\nstar student. He found himself in an ongoing debate with a professor over\nperceived design flaws in the direct-current (DC) motors that were being\ndemonstrated in class.\n\nHe would spend the next six years of his life thinking about electromagnetic\nfields and a hypothetical motor powered by alternating current (AC). The ideas\nobsessed him, and he was unable to focus on his schoolwork. Professors at the\nuniversity warned Tesla\u2019s father that the young scholar\u2019s working and sleeping\nhabits were killing him. Rather than finishing his studies, Tesla dropped out\nof school during his third year in 1878. He became addicted to gambling, lost\nall his tuition money and suffered a nervous breakdown. It would not be his\nlast.\n\nAfter recovering, Tesla moved to Budapest to work as a draftsman in 1881. \u201cI\nhated drawing,\u201d he wrote, \u201cIt was for me the very worst of annoyances.\u201d But\none day, he was walking through a park with his new friend Antal Szigety,\nreciting verses from Goethe\u2019s Faust, when an \u201cidea came like a lightning\nflash.\u201d And there in the park, with a stick, Tesla drew a crude diagram in the\ndirt: a motor using the principle of rotating magnetic fields created by two\nor more alternating currents. While AC electrification had been employed\nbefore, there would never be a practical, working motor run on alternating\ncurrent until he invented his induction motor several years later.\n\n## Tesla\u2019s rise to the top\n\nIn June 1884, Tesla sailed for New York City, arriving with four cents in his\npocket and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor\u2014a former\nemployer\u2014to Edison, which was purported to say, \u201cMy Dear Edison: I know two\ngreat men and you are one of them. The other is this young man!\u201d\n\nThomas Edison and his early phonograph Public domain via Wikimedia\nCommonsGeorge Westinghouse between 1900 and 1914 Public domain via Wikimedia\nCommons\n\nA meeting was arranged, and once Tesla described the engineering work he was\ndoing, Edison, though skeptical, hired him. According to Tesla, Edison offered\nhim $50,000 if he could improve upon the DC generation plants Edison favored.\nWithin a few months, Tesla informed the American inventor that he had indeed\nimproved upon Edison\u2019s motors. Edison, Tesla noted, refused to pay up. \u201cWhen\nyou become a full-fledged American, you will appreciate an American joke,\u201d\nEdison told him.\n\nTesla promptly quit and took a job digging ditches. But it wasn\u2019t long before\nword got out that Tesla\u2019s AC motor was worth investing in, and the Western\nUnion Company put Tesla to work in a lab not far from Edison\u2019s office, where\nhe designed AC power systems that are still used around the world. \u201cThe motors\nI built there,\u201d Tesla said, \u201cwere exactly as I imagined them. I made no\nattempt to improve the design, but merely reproduced the pictures as they\nappeared to my vision, and the operation was always as I expected.\u201d\n\nThomas Edison Did Everything He Could To Stop Nikola Tesla Succeeding | Tesla's Death Ray\n\nWatch on\n\nTesla patented his AC motors and power systems, which were said to be the most\nvaluable inventions since the telephone. Soon, Westinghouse, recognizing that\nTesla\u2019s designs might be just what he needed in his efforts to unseat Edison\u2019s\nDC current, bought his patents for $60,000 in stocks, cash and royalties based\non how much electricity Westinghouse could sell. Ultimately, he won the \u201cWar\nof the Currents,\u201d but at a steep cost in litigation and competition for both\nWestinghouse and Edison\u2019s General Electric Company.\n\nFearing ruin, Westinghouse begged Tesla for relief from the royalties he had\nagreed to. \u201cYour decision determines the fate of the Westinghouse Company,\u201d he\nsaid. Tesla, grateful to the man who had never tried to swindle him, tore up\nthe royalty contract, walking away from millions of dollars in royalties that\nhe was already owed and billions that would have accrued in the future. He\nwould have been one of the wealthiest men in the world\u2014a titan of the Gilded\nAge.\n\n## A \u2018faint-hearted, doubting world\u2019\n\nTesla\u2019s work with electricity reflected just one facet of his fertile mind.\nBefore the turn of the 20th century, Tesla had invented a powerful coil\ncapable of generating high voltages and frequencies, leading to new forms of\nlight, such as neon and fluorescent, as well as X-rays. Tesla also discovered\nthat these coils, soon to be called \u201cTesla coils,\u201d made it possible to send\nand receive radio signals. He quickly filed for American patents in 1897,\nbeating the Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi to the punch.\n\nTesla continued to work on his ideas for wireless transmissions, which he\npitched to J.P. Morgan. After Morgan put up the $150,000 to build the giant\ntransmission tower, Tesla promptly hired the noted architect Stanford White of\nMcKim, Mead and White in New York. White, too, was smitten with Tesla\u2019s idea.\nAfter all, this was the highly acclaimed man behind Westinghouse\u2019s success\nwith alternating current, and when Tesla talked, he was persuasive. As the\ninventor said at the time:\n\n> As soon as completed, it will be possible for a businessman in New York to\n> dictate instructions and have them instantly appear in type at his office in\n> London or elsewhere. He will be able to call up, from his desk, and talk to\n> any telephone subscriber on the globe, without any change whatever in the\n> existing equipment. An inexpensive instrument, not bigger than a watch, will\n> enable its bearer to hear anywhere, on sea or land, music or song, the\n> speech of a political leader, the address of an eminent man of science or\n> the sermon of an eloquent clergyman, delivered in some other place, however\n> distant. In the same manner any picture, character, drawing or print can be\n> transferred from one to another place. Millions of such instruments can be\n> operated from but one plant of this kind.\n\nTesla's 187-foot-tall Wardenclyffe Tower in 1904 Public domain via Wikimedia\nCommons\n\nWhite got to work designing Wardenclyffe Tower in 1901, but soon after\nconstruction began it became apparent that Tesla was going to run out of money\ntoo quickly. An appeal to Morgan for more funding proved fruitless, and in the\nmeantime, investors were rushing to throw their money behind Marconi. In\nDecember 1901, the Italian inventor successfully sent a signal from England to\nNewfoundland, the first trans-Atlantic radio transmission. Tesla grumbled that\nMarconi was using 17 of his patents, but litigation eventually favored\nMarconi, and the commercial damage was done. (The U.S. Supreme Court\nultimately upheld Tesla\u2019s claims, clarifying his role in the invention of the\nradio\u2014but not until 1943, shortly after he died.) Thus, Marconi was credited\nas the inventor of radio and became rich. Wardenclyffe Tower became a\n186-foot-tall relic (it would be razed in 1917) known as Tesla\u2019s \u201cmillion\ndollar folly.\u201d The defeat\u2014his worst yet\u2014led to another breakdown. \u201cIt is not a\ndream,\u201d Tesla said, \u201cit is a simple feat of scientific electrical engineering,\nonly expensive\u2014blind, faint-hearted, doubting world!\u201d\n\nBy 1912, Tesla began to withdraw from that doubting world. He was showing\nsigns of obsessive-compulsive disorder. He became consumed with cleanliness\nand fixated on the number three: excessively washing his hands, counting his\nsteps, staying only in hotel rooms with numbers divisible by three and setting\n18 napkins on his table during meals. He claimed to have an abnormal\nsensitivity to sounds, as well as an acute sense of sight, and he later wrote\nthat he had \u201ca violent aversion against the earrings of women,\u201d and \u201cthe sight\nof a pearl would almost give me a fit.\u201d\n\nNear the end of his life, Tesla became fixated on pigeons, especially a\nspecific white female, which he claimed to love almost as one would love a\nhuman being. Tesla said the white pigeon visited him through an open window at\nhis hotel one night, and he believed the bird had come to tell him she was\ndying. He saw \u201ctwo powerful beams of light\u201d in the bird\u2019s eyes, he recalled.\n\u201cYes, it was a real light, a powerful, dazzling, blinding light, a light more\nintense than I had ever produced by the most powerful lamps in my laboratory.\u201d\nThe pigeon died in his arms, and the inventor claimed that in that moment, he\nknew that he had finished his life\u2019s work.\n\nTesla on the cover of Time magazine in 1931 Public domain via Wikimedia\nCommons\n\nThroughout the following years, Tesla would make news from time to time, while\nliving on the 33rd floor of the New Yorker Hotel. In 1931, he made the cover\nof Time magazine, which featured his inventions on his 75th birthday. And in\n1934, the New York Times reported that Tesla was working on a \u201cDeath Beam\u201d\ncapable of knocking 10,000 enemy airplanes out of the sky. \u201cWhen put in\noperation, Dr. Tesla said, this latest invention of his would make war\nimpossible,\u201d surrounding countries like an impenetrable, invisible wall, the\nTimes reported. He hoped to fund the prototypical defensive weapon in the\ninterest of world peace, but Tesla\u2019s appeals to J.P. Morgan Jr. and British\nPrime Minister Neville Chamberlain went nowhere. The Soviet Union did fund his\ninvestigations of beam weapons in 1939, to the tune of $25,000, but the\nproject languished.\n\nThough the inventor\u2019s genius had forever changed the world of electrical\nengineering, Tesla\u2019s final days were clouded by his business and social\nineptitudes. He died at age 86, in debt, though Westinghouse had been paying\nhis room and board at the hotel for years.\n\nAdditional Sources \u201cReflections on the Mind of Nikola Tesla\u201d by R.
