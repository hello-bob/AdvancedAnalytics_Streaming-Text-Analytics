A legal loophole had\nallowed authorities to categorise Orans as wasteland, enabling their\ndecimation.\n\nWhile conservationists and environmentalists welcomed the added layer of\nprotection to the Orans, several legal and environmental experts cautioned\nthat the new categorisation may not be enough to safeguard the groves. This is\nbecause the Forest Conservation (Amendment) Act of 2023--a legal tool that the\nBharatiya Janata Party-led Union government brought in to regulate chopping of\nforestlands for non-forestry purposes--has diluted the restrictions on\nclearing deemed forests.\n\n\u201cDeemed forest status doesn\u2019t mean protection. Even earlier, FCA [Forest\nConservation Act] laws didn\u2019t act as a barrier but more as a speed breaker,\u201d\nsaid environmental lawyer Ritwick Dutta, adding that the dilutions in the\namended FCA allowed for faster and easier diversions.\n\nThe FCA of 1980 had certain restrictive provisions, wherein the Centre\u2019s\napproval was required to convert the status of forest to non-forest land. But\nin the amended FCA, the clearance of deemed, unclassed and private forests can\nbe done by the state government itself.\n\nExperts say that the new amendment would exclude deemed, unclassed and private\nforests from requiring forest clearance, i.e., that the government can divert\nthese forests for non-forest purposes without following the pre-existing\nprocess. In a Supreme Court case where the constitutionality of these\namendments has been challenged, the Court noted in an interim order that\ndeemed forests as per the 1996 Godavarman case should be protected.\n\nCommunities that have been protecting Orans for generations are unhappy. They\nbelieve that changing the Orans\u2019 status to deemed forests will put them under\nthe authority of the forest department and will restrict their access to the\ngroves. Villagers from Jaisalmer, who had been protesting against the\ndiversion of Orans\u2019 to development projects, have now added the new \u201cdeemed\nforest\u201d categorisation to their ongoing protest. The protestors have\nthreatened to boycott the 2024 Lok Sabha polls if the decision is not\nreversed.\n\nSumer Singh Bhati, from the Sanwata village in Jaisalmer, is the head of the\nShri Degrai Ushtra Conservation Institute, which works for saving Orans in the\nregion. He has been spearheading the \u201cOran nahi toh vote nahi\u201d(No Oran, no\nvote) movement.\n\nA collage of images shows people holding up signs that say \u201cOran nahi toh vote\nnahi\u201d(No Oran, no vote). Communities that have been protecting Orans for\ngenerations believe that changing the Orans\u2019 status to deemed forests will put\nthem under the authority of the forest department and will restrict their\naccess to the groves. Photo by special arrangement\n\nPrakriti Srivastava, a retired Indian Forest Service officer, said that the\nOrans should have been notified as a \u201cforest\u201d when the Supreme Court first\nordered the states to identify such ecologies, in the landmark T.N. Godavarman\nThirumulpad V. Union Of India & Others judgement in 1996. It would have\nbrought areas like Orans, that did not follow the dictionary meaning of\nforest, under the scope of the FCA of 1980, and provided them some protection.\n\nShe questioned the 27-year delay that led to a massive loss of biodiversity\nbecause the Orans were not recognised.\n\nThis reporter reached out to Arindam Tomar, the additional principal chief\nconservator of forests, Rajasthan, regarding the locals\u2019 concerns on access to\nthe Orans and the future of the groves. Further, emails were sent to the\ninspector general of forests, Ramesh Pandey, the additional director general\nof forests, Satya Prakash Yadav, and the head of the media cell, Tanmay Kumar,\nof the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change regarding the\nprotection of Orans from diversions after the change in its status. We will\nupdate this story when we receive their response.\n\nOrans as wastelands\n\nOrans are community-conserved green spaces that include indigenous trees, such\nas Khejri (Prosopis cineraria) and Rohida (Tecomella undulata), and are\nusually dedicated to local deities.\n\nThey were on the verge of destruction as revenue records marked them as a\nculturable wasteland--government land that could be brought under cultivation.\nThis made it easier for Orans to be allotted for non-forest activities. There\nhave been many instances of the indiscriminate cutting of trees for renewable\nenergy projects in Rajasthan without any accountability to the communities\nthat are bound to the Orans.\n\nThese communities had been demanding the identification and correct\ncategorisation of Orans for years. In 2018, the SC passed an order in an\ninterlocutory application stemming from the 1996 judgement, to allay the\ncommunities\u2019 concerns. The Court had asked Rajasthan to classify Orans, and\nother habitats representing desert ecosystems, as deemed forests.\n\nThe Rajasthan government took no action till February this year. The recent\nnotification was in response to an order by the apex court, on January 10,\nwhere the SC asked the state to highlight the \u201csteps being taken for\nidentification and survey of Orans, De-Vans, Rundhs among others such groves\nas forest land\u201d.\n\nThe Court also added that \u201cit would be compelled to take such steps as may be\nfound necessary\u201d if the state did not comply by the next hearing. The SC\u2019s\norder was in response to another appeal made in the apex court in 2022, in the\nform of an interlocutory application by Aman Singh, the founder of KRAPAVIS, a\ngrassroots organisation that works on the conservation of Orans in Rajasthan.\n\nAs per KRAPAVIS\u2019 estimates, around 600,000 hectares of land is currently\ncovered by Orans in Rajasthan, while the notification covered groves occupying\na little over 400,000 hectares of land. According to Singh, only 5,000 or so\nOrans had been notified out of the total 25,000 recorded in the public domain.\nStill, he was hopeful about the Orans\u2019 future as he was in talks with the\nforest department regarding their conservation.\n\n\u201cI am pleased this happened because it would mean that you can\u2019t change the\ncategory of Orans [to wastelands] in records,\u201d he told IndiaSpend.\n\nConflicts over Orans\n\nThe Orans were designated as culturable wastelands during colonial times.\nLocals had been unaware of this status till 1999, when for the first time,\nsolar companies started cutting down the trees, affecting 36,000 bighas or\n9,116 hectares of Oran land near the Degrai Mata Mandir in Jaisalmer.\n\nThe wasteland category is not exempted from diversion for development\nprojects. Thus, the diversion of Orans did not require much scrutiny as\nallotments were done based on the status of the land in written records of the\nrevenue department, without any on-ground surveys.\n\nAs per the Land Conflict Watch database that maps and analyses ongoing land\nconflicts in India, there were numerous cases, mostly in western rural\nRajasthan, that resulted in the disappearance of Orans over the years.\n\nFor instance in 2011, in Kanoi village, huge tracts of land including Orans\nwere allotted to Vish Wind infrastructure for windmill projects because they\nwere categorised as wastelands. The Kanoi Orans were a lifeline of the GIBs\nand other important species like Indian gazelle, desert fox and steppe eagles.\nIn Dawara village of Jaisalmer, over 150 sacred trees, part of the Oran\necosystem, were reportedly cut because of the wrong categorisation. This led\nto the allotment of land to an Adani Group company for a solar project in\n2021.\n\nDespite protests and legal cases, there were very few examples where the green\nprojects were halted. Pooja Chandran, a legal researcher at the Foundation for\nEcological Security, said, \u201cThe courts follow what is in records that might\nnot represent the actual use of land. If the judge is willing to go beyond the\nwritten words, then some relief might be possible.\u201d She added that the\ncommunities needed more legal recourse. The categorisation of Orans as deemed\nforests could have been beneficial if not for the amended FCA.\n\nBhati, from Sanwata village, said that he was \u201cnot too glad about this\ndecision because when these lands come under the forest department, what is\nthe guarantee that they will not be given to the companies for non-forestry\npurposes like solar and wind projects?\u201d\n\nLocals have been protesting because they feared that the forest department\nmight restrict their access to the Orans\u2019 grazing areas. Despite assurances\nfrom forest officials that grazing would be allowed, the communities remain\nsceptical.\n\nThe lost Orans\n\nSrivastava, the former IFS officer, said that the state government should have\nprepared the inventory of all the Orans in the state, as per the Godavarman\njudgement, by 1997. Not doing so was contempt of court. \u201cThey were sleeping\nall this while. Can you imagine how much area would have been diverted in the\nmeantime, and how much Orans have been lost?\u201d\n\nIn 2011, the Supreme Court had expanded on its 1996 judgement and directed the\nUnion government, the Forest Survey of India, states and Union territories to\nprepare geo-referenced maps of every type of forest in the country, for the\nFCA 1980. This order, too, was not complied with.\n\nThe SC order in 2018--to categorise Orans and similar such habitats,\nirrespective of their size, as deemed forest--was more direct.\n\nNow, when the demand has finally been fulfilled, the amendment of FCA has made\nthe law toothless. Srivastava told IndiaSpend that in certain cases,\ndiversions of Orans will not even require forest clearance, due to blanket\nexemption for specific purposes under the amended FCA.\n\n\u201cIt could be easily used for non-forest purposes if it fell 100 km away from\nthe international border, or alongside a rail line or a public road which\nprovides access to public utilities or habitations, and 10 hectares for\nsecurity requirements as per the new Act.\u201d\n\nBack in Jaisalmer, Bhati is worried. \u201cWe want the Orans to be identified and\nprotected and not to come under the forest department,\" he told IndiaSpend.\n\"Their deemed forest status would not just stop communities from accessing and\nconserving them, but would also not stop them from being given to companies\nfor non-forest purposes.\u201d\n\n## Sukriti Vats\n\nSukriti Vats is a Writing Fellow with Land Conflict Watch, an independent\nnetwork of researchers, which carries out research on land and natural\nresources.\n\nNext Story\n\n#### Similar Posts\n\nNewsletters\n\n### About IndiaSpend\n\n  * About Us\n  * Our Team\n  * Trustees & Patrons\n  * Contact\n\n### Top Categories\n\n  * Health\n  * Education\n  * Gender\n  * Environment\n  * Economy\n  * Agriculture\n  * Governance\n  * India Governance Report\n\n### Special Projects\n\n  * ResearchWire\n  * Environment Undone\n  * Women@Work\n  * Modi\u2019s Report Card\n  * India\u2019s Job Crisis\n  * Budget\n  * Election 2019\n  * Dataviz\n  * India Governance Report\n  * COVID-19\n  * Data Gaps\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2024\n\nPowered by Hocalwire\n\nX\n\n## Welcome\n\n# This site asks for consent to use your data\n\n  * perm_identity\n\nPersonalised advertising and content, advertising and content measurement,\naudience research and services development\n\n  * devices\n\nStore and/or access information on a device\n\n  * How can I change my choice?\n\n  * What if I don't consent?\n\n  * How does legitimate interest work?\n\n  * Do I have to consent to everything?\n\nYour personal data will be processed and information from your device\n(cookies, unique identifiers, and other device data) may be stored by,\naccessed by and shared with 136 TCF vendor(s) and 62 ad partner(s), or used\nspecifically by this site or app.\n\nSome vendors may process your personal data on the basis of legitimate\ninterest, which you can object to by managing your options below.
