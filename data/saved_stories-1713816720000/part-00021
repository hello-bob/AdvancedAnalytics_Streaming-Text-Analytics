AMD repeated those calls over the weekend.\n\nAMD posted to X (Twitter) on Sunday:\n\n> \"We appreciate the open source interest in Radeon. We\u2019re on track to release\n> MES documentation late May followed by source code. Additional parts of the\n> Radeon stack to be open sourced throughout the year. GitHub has the latest\n> on fixes, release dates.\"\n\nThey also continue pointing to the nod-ai/fuzzyHSA GitHub repository as the\nresource for fixes and more information on these efforts. (AMD acquired nod.ai\nthough this repository location continues to sit rather odd with given the\nother ROCm repositories already in existence and lack of cohesive developer\nexperience as I've written about before with a lot of fragmentation.)\n\nBeyond the MES firmware documentation/code, it will be interesting to see what\nmore AMD open sources throughout 2024 whether it be firmware or other\ncomponents to complement their existing open-source Linux kernel\ngraphics/compute driver stack from the open AMDGPU/AMDKFD kernel drivers up\nthrough all of their user-space bits.\n\n4 Comments\n\nRelated News\n\nAMD Posts RDNA3+ Firmware Files For Linux Users\n\nOpen-Source \"Terakan\" Vulkan Driver For Radeon HD 6000 Series Shown On Windows\n\nAMD Sends In More Kernel Graphics Driver Updates For Linux 6.10\n\nROCm 6.1 Released With Ubuntu 22.04.4 Support, rocDecode For AMD Video Decode\n\nAMD Prepares More Next-Gen GPU Driver Support For Linux 6.10\n\nOpen-Source Radeon Driver Enables Support For Vulkan Video H.264/H.265 Encode\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
