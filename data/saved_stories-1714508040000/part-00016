Hurt (IPAC)/Caltech)\n\nMore evidence for a hypothetical extra planet lurking in the most distant\nreaches of our solar system has come to light \u2014 and the clues are associated\nwith icy bodies that cross the orbit of Neptune while traversing long, looping\npaths around the sun.\n\nPlanet Nine, as the predicted planet is referred to, was first postulated in\n2016 by Caltech's Konstantin Batygin and Michael Brown, the latter having also\ndiscovered the dwarf planet Eris in 2005. Their original evidence\npredominantly focused on the clustering of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs),\nwhich are objects that spend the majority of their orbits farther from the sun\nthan Neptune is. That's quite far. More specifically, the duo had zoomed in on\nTNOs with high inclinations, meaning the objects orbited the sun at steep\nangles to the ecliptic plane.\n\nBecause the solar system's contents formed from a disk around the sun, we\nwould expect the orbits of everything orbiting the sun to keep relatively\nclose to the plane of that disk. However, some don\u2019t \u2014 and the team infers\nthis as evidence that Planet Nine's gravity could be pulling the objects out\nof the ecliptic and bunching them together in highly inclined orbits that\nshare similar \"apsides\" (closest and most distant points in their orbits\naround the sun) and which are orientated with a similar tilt away from the\necliptic.\n\nRelated: Evidence for 'Planet 9' may actually show our theory of gravity is\nincomplete\n\nHowever, some astronomers remained skeptical, arguing that what Batygin and\nBrown saw as clustering is just an illusion caused by observational bias. The\nCaltech duo dispute this, and have actually now published a paper that focuses\nparticularly on observations of low-inclination TNOs that don't cluster, but\nwhich still have peculiarities.\n\nThese icy TNOs are strange because they spend most of their life hundreds of\ntimes farther from the sun than Earth is, but their orbits are so elongated\nthat they swoop in and spend a short while closer to the sun than Neptune,\nwhich is just 30 times farther from the sun than Earth. \"With this work, we\nlooked at objects with long-period orbits but which also strongly interact\nwith Neptune, specifically those that cross Neptune'\u2019s orbit,\" Batygin told\nSpace.com.\n\nThis doesn't include every object that crosses Neptune's orbit, to be clear.\nPluto is a good counterexample. Like Pluto, the majority of TNOs don't have\norbits that are as elongated as the ones included in the team's new research.\nRather, most TNOs have trajectories that keep them relatively close enough to\nNeptune for extended periods of time such that they can be controlled by the\nice giant's gravity.\n\n## Get the Space.com Newsletter\n\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events\nand more!\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nThe team, however, concerned itself only with those TNOs that get hundreds of\nastronomical units away from Neptune's gravitational tides, where Planet Nine\ncan exert influence over them \u2014 if it so exists, of course. Because these\nstudied objects come from all directions close to the ecliptic plane, without\nexhibiting any clustering behavior, the same claim of bias leveled at previous\nevidence regarding high-inclination, clustering TNOs does not hold.\n\nThe studied TNOs, and any on similar paths, don't spend too much time in their\norbits; over the course of millions of years the gravity of the azure blue ice\ngiant Neptune inevitably bats them away, scattering them far and wide and\nsometimes even out of the solar system entirely. This means that whatever is\nsending TNOs onto Neptune-crossing orbits is doing so continuously. There must\nbe an ongoing process in place to keep the TNO supply replenished. This means\nthat the culprit can't be something that happened in the distant past, like a\nstar passing particularly close by. It has to be something that still exists.\n\nThere are two scenarios that could regularly place TNOs on long, looping\norbits that cross Neptune's path. One scenario is that of the galactic tide,\nwhich is the gravitational tidal force of the Milky Way galaxy all around us\nacting on objects within the Oort Cloud, which lies far away beyond Neptune.\nThese objects only loosely feel the sun's gravity due to their distance from\nour host star, but the galactic tide can usher them closer towards Neptune.\n\nThe existence of a roughly Neptune-mass Planet Nine could explain why the few\nknown extreme trans-Neptunian objects seem to be clustered together in space.\nThe diagram was created using WorldWide Telescope. (Image credit: Caltech/R.\nHurt (IPAC))\n\nThe other scenario \u2014 perhaps the more interesting one \u2014 is that the gravity of\nPlanet Nine is perturbing these Oort Cloud objects enough that they tread\ncloser to Neptune over time.\n\nBatygin and his team \u2014 Michael Brown, Alessandro Morbidelli of the\nObservatoire de la C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur in Nice, France, and David Nesvorny of the\nSouth-west Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado \u2014 performed two sets of\nsimulations using observational data of real, low-inclination, Neptune-\ncrossing TNOs to learn which scenario is more accurate.\n\nOne simulation involved a planet with a mass five times that of Earth\ninfluencing the TNOs (the simulated properties they used for Planet Nine are\nderived from the characteristics that best explained previous evidence such as\nthe clustering of the high-inclination TNOs), while the other simulation had\nno Planet Nine at all and modeled just the galactic tide. Which would be most\nadept at getting TNOs to pass by Neptune?\n\nThe simulations showed that low-inclination TNOs can only regularly penetrate\nNeptune's orbit if Planet Nine is indeed there to slingshot them. On their\nown, the eddies of the galactic tides were calculated as too weak to get TNOs\npast Neptune. Hence, in the galactic tides simulation, the TNOs get to within\na certain distance of the sun and no closer \u2014 but in the Planet Nine scenario,\nthe TNOs are spread across a range of Neptune-crossing orbits, which matches\nwhat we see in reality.\n\n\"We show that you can reject the scenario where this is all happening because\nof the galactic tides with an astonishing degree of statistical significance,\"\nsaid Batygin. \"Conversely, the Planet Nine scenario is perfectly compatible\nwith the data.\"\n\nBatygin likens it to a football (soccer, for you Americans reading) match,\nwhere Neptune is the goalkeeper. The galactic tides can shoot the TNOs towards\nthe goal, but not with enough oomph to get them past the goalkeeper. Planet\nNine, on the other hand, is like a planetary Harry Kane, regularly shooting\nthe TNOs past Neptune with finesse.\n\n\"What we see in the data are a bunch of footballs inside the goal,\" said\nBatygin.\n\nStill, the hunt for the football striker continues.\n\nRendered image of the Vera C.

It\nwill be able to test the evidence for Planet Nine available so far \u2014 the\nclustering of the orbits, the alignment of their orbital planes, their steep\norbital inclinations, and the prevalence of retrograde (backwards orbiting)\nCentaurs. Those refer to icy bodies that have come in from the Oort Cloud and\nwhich currently orbit among the solar system's outer planets. If any of these\nare illusions caused by observational biases, then the Vera Rubin observations\nwill reveal them to be. Though conversely, it could strengthen the evidence,\nand find many more TNOs that exhibit the same potential influences of Planet\nNine.\n\n\"It will test all of these gravitational lines of evidence with an independent\nnew survey that is not subject to the same biases as the previous ones,\" said\nBatygin.\n\nIt is even possible that the Vera Rubin Observatory will go all the way and\nactually find the big tamale.\n\n\"By virtue of its efficiency, maybe \u2014 just maybe \u2014 it will find Planet Nine,\"\nsaid Batygin. \"That would be pretty cool.\"\n\nThe new results have been accepted for publication in The Astrophysical\nJournal Letters, and are presently available as a pre-print.\n\nJoin our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky\nand more!
