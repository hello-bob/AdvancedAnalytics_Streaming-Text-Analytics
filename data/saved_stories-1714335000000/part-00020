The Temptation in the Garden of Eden. Courtesy of V&A\nMuseum. Circa 1600.\n\nYes. This is another attempt at criticising that impregnable castle that is\nGuns, Germs and Steel.1 The internet is full of reviews, summaries and, of\ncourse, those classy threads in Reddit. He has been widely prized, but also\ncriticised in almost all fronts; history, human evolution, geography, and in\nmany cases he seems to have been badly wounded, like in that review of Michael\nBarratt Brown, or the Mises Institute critical review on what they call\nDiamond\u2019s pseudo-history. But when it comes to biology, he still stands tall\nand proud, like the Sphinx at Giza.\n\nThat is why I am still to find a proper critique of Diamond\u2019s chapter on\nanimal domestication. The more I read about the subject, whereas horses or\naurochs, the more I find that there seems to be two camps: one completely\nignores Diamond, as if avoiding the wrath of a Demigod; the other one cites\nhis books and articles as priests citing Saint Matthew.\n\nThanks for reading Bruegel_The_Elder\u2019s Substack!

It also\nputs me on a blind spot, as most non-specialists can easily get lost in the\ndetail and interpret things in a completely mistaken way. I get that. But not\nbeing a biologist also allows me to approach the subject with an unorthodox\npoint of view. I am irresolutely at peace with the prospect of being wrong\nabout animal domestication. Probably Diamond has been right all along and that\nis why no one challenges his theory of animal domestication.\n\nDiamond\u2019s thesis about animal domestication is poured in chapter 9 Zebras,\nUnhappy Marriages, and the Anna Karenina Principle. But before I start talking\nabout the subject proper, I need to say something about the literary analogy.\nThe \u201cAnna Karenina principle\u201d has been used in all sort of situations and it\nwasn\u2019t invented by Diamond. He may have made it widely popular outside the\nfenced pastures of literary criticism and other disciplines such as psychology\nand economics, but it\u2019s definitely not his. I say this because people seem to\nattribute to Diamond all sort of ideas, when in reality what he has done, very\nwell, is to summarise a huge variety of different ideas and to create a\nsynthesis of what he thinks is the evolution of mankind. Another very popular\nmyth is that he invented the continental axis hypothesis. The first person to\nmention it was Alfred Crosby in Ecological Imperialism.2 Crosby did not\nelaborate a full hypothesis though, and only mentioned the possibility of the\nnorth-south axis of the Americas to be one of many reasons for the slow pace\nof development:\n\n\u201cWhy was the New World so tardily civilized? Perhaps because the long axis of\nthe Americas runs north and south, and so the Amerindian food plants on which\nall New World civilizations depended had to spread through sharply differing\nclimates, unlike the staple crops of the Old World, which by and large spread\neast and west through regions of roughly similar climates.\u201d (p. 18)\n\nCrosby wrote the above in 1986, almost a decade before Diamond\u2019s first edition\nof Guns, Germs and Steel. It looks pretty similar to what Diamond proposes,\nright? What I find dishonest from Diamond is the fact that although he does\ncite Crosby in his literature, he never says this idea was first proposed\nby... which is kind of cheeky, to say the least.\n\nAnyway, Chapter 9. Zebras, Unhappy Marriages, and the Anna Karenina Principle.\nDiamond presents here fourteen species as the backbone of animal\ndomestication. Nine species are presented as minor, and five species are\npresented as major. We will focus now on the major ones: Sheep, Goat, Cow,\nPig, Horse. These are the five species that have become ubiquitous around the\nworld. The original range of these five species is located in Eurasia and this\nis very important because we must remember that Europeans, Diamond says\nEurasians but he cannot mean anything other than Europeans, came to dominate\nthe world and have guns, germs and steel. Yes, Genghis Khan, Darius and the\nOttomans were not Europeans, but neither they arrive in ships to the Americas\nin 1492, nor created the Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and British Empires, or\ngave birth to the United States of America, Australia and New Zealand. A\nfundamental milestone in the European triumph, or Eurasian if you prefer a\nmore ambiguous term, was the domestication of animals and plants. In the case\nof plants, humans practically stumbled upon a massive wild granary in the\nFertile Crescent as soon as they came out of Africa 40000 years ago. Some may\npoint at the fact that, more precisely, this occurred after the Last Glacial\nMaxima (LGM), but it seems that the region in point wasn\u2019t affected too much\n(please forgive my leniency if that wasn\u2019t the case). There really was not\nmuch to do, wheat, barley, pulses were all there, not only growing across\nlarge expanses, but also being very productive already in their wild forms. It\ndoesn\u2019t come as a surprise then that recent discoveries have pushed back the\ndate of early human use of cereals in the Levant to 23000 years ago, in a site\ncalled Abu Hureyra 1 in Syria. Please bear in mind that this doesn\u2019t mean that\nhumans started eating cereals 23000 years ago, it simply means that we know,\nfor certain, that humans were using cereals by then; humans relationship with\ncereals could be much older, but we have not found evidence of older use, or\nfurther evidence from elsewhere to prove that this was the case across a large\narea in the Levant and the rest of the Fertile Crescent at the same date. As a\ncomparison, the oldest evidence of cereal domestication, that is, people\nactually growing modern forms of wheat, is 10700 years old in a site called\nTell Qarassa North, in southern Syria.\n\nBut animal domestication was different. We are not going to tell the\nindividual story of each species here because neither does Diamond; what\nmatters is what he considers the fundamental characteristics for a species to\nbe domesticated. Here comes the Anna Karenina principle: \u201cHappy families are\nall alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\u201d In order to be\nhappy, a marriage needs to succeed in many different respects, says Diamond.\nHe then goes on to explain the characteristics of the Anna Karenina principle\nwhen applied to animal domestication:\n\n  * flexible diet\n\n  * appropriate growth rate\n\n  * successful breeding in captivity\n\n  * pleasant disposition towards humans\n\n  * steady temperament\n\n  * adaptable social hierarchy\n\nIn order to be domesticable, an animal must have all six characteristics. It\ncannot be fussy with food; it needs to grow fast; it must be able to breed in\ncaptivity; it must not panic or get completely infuriated by human presence\nand, finally, it must have a hierarchical social organisation whereby humans\ncan occupy the vacant place of the alpha male leadership.\n\nAnd here my dear readers, is where I think this gets rather tricky. The more I\nread the above \u201ccharacteristics\u201d, the more I have a weird feeling about it.\nBecause what Diamond is describing under the banner of the \u2018Anna Karenina\nPrinciple\u2019 could be the result of thousands of years of selective breeding and\nnot a series of traits shared among some wild animals. This is what I call a\nclassic example of the Hempel\u2019s paradox: \u2018A case of a hypothesis supports the\nhypothesis.\u2019 Yes, the black raven. \u201cAll Ravens are black\u201d is equal to \u201cAll\nnon-black things are non-ravens\u201d and, therefore, a white shoe provides as much\nevidence that all ravens are black as a black raven does.\n\nIf we see one black raven, it doesn\u2019t mean that all ravens are black, it\nsimply is a piece of evidence supporting the hypothesis. Likewise, seeing\n10000 black ravens still doesn\u2019t prove that all ravens are black; it would\nonly show us that we may be going in the right direction, but is not\nincontrovertible proof. But what happens if we see a single white raven? Well,\nwe would have found incontrovertible, irrefutable and definite proof that not\nall ravens are black.\n\nBut a white shoe is another proof that all ravens are black, as all non-black\nthings are non-ravens, right? There are two positions about this; a) a white\nshoe is a red herring (sensu Wood, 1967); b) a white shoe is not a red herring\n(sensu Hempel, 1967). Wood argues that the paradoxes of confirmation are\nspurious on the ground that one of the two assumptions underlying them is\nfalse; a white shoe does not represent evidence that all ravens are black.\nHempel, on the other hand, argues that objects may have properties that make\nthem confirmatory and disconfirmatory for a given hypothesis. A bird may be a\nraven and black, but may also have an albino for a sister; it would then prove\nand disprove the hypothesis that all ravens are black.\n\nBut in following Diamond\u2019s argument, I feel that the best way of explaining my\nown convoluted argument is by using a literary analogy, as he has done with\nTolstoi\u2019s novel. Let\u2019s call it the Chernobyl Principle, based on the HBO\u2019s\nadaptation of Svetlana Alexievich\u2019s Voices from Chernobyl. In one of the first\nepisodes, a scientist called Valery Legasov is invited to a meeting of the\nPolitburo presided by President Mikhail Gorbachev. Once the politburo has been\nbriefed about the accident at Chernobyl in very rossy terms, Gorbachev\nadjourns the meeting, but Legasov objects, saying that he\u2019s been worried about\nthe mentions of black debris in the report which he believes is graphite. He\nalso says that he is worried about the 3.6 roentgen radiation measure reported\n(one of the members of the politburo has liken it to a chest X-ray). As it\nturns out, the 3.6 roentgen magical number was the result of the low-limit\ndosimeters maxing out. The radiation was much higher indeed, but \u201cthey gave us\nthe number they had.\u201d\n\nThe Chernobyl Principle then, would dictate that what you see, does not\nnecessarily equals to what you do not see. Diamond seems to be giving us \u2018the\nnumber he had\u2019, consciously or otherwise. According to him, Zebras have not\nbeen domesticated simply because they have evolved in an ecosystem overcrowded\nby predators, and therefore have become too aggressive, too twitchy, too\nsuspicious (which, by the way, doesn\u2019t explain the Zebras\u2019 ducking reflex that\nmakes them so good at avoiding the lasso). But what evidence do we have that\nthe wild relative of the horse was not as wild as the zebra? Since the closest\nwild relatives of the modern horse have no descendants today, Diamond is\nsupporting his characterisation of the horse as an ideal candidate for\ndomestication on the heavily domesticated modern horse, not on historical or\narchaeological evidence, as the former is non-existent (the domestication of\nthe horse predates writing) and the latter is scant. He basically says that\nthe wild horses that roamed Eurasia\u2019s steppes did not have to constantly deal\nwith and be aware of cheetahs, lions and hyenas as zebras do on a daily basis\nin Africa; but he also forgets to mention that wild horses did have to contend\nwith the most dangerous predator of all in Eurasia: humans. Since all we see\naround us are black ravens, we end up assuming that all ravens are black. But\nthis may not have been always the case; maybe we pushed white ravens to\nextinction because we thought they were a bad omen.\n\nBut let us elaborate further the Chernobyl principle with a more relevant and\nappropriate example (we haven\u2019t domesticated ravens after all). Aurochs are\nthe ancestors of modern cattle and, as ancient horses, they went extinct. The\nbig difference is that they lived much longer than horses in the wild and so,\nthere is written evidence of their behaviour from Poland, where they\nsupposedly existed until the High Middle Ages, I say supposedly because there\nis always the question mark of how wild they were by then. The following\ndescriptions appear in Van Vuure (2005): \u201cAn aurochs is not afraid of humans\nand will not flee when a human being comes near, it will hardly avoid him when\nhe approaches it slowly.\u201d3 But then, the same author cites other passages from\nchroniclers where the European bison, held in similar conditions to the\nAurochs in Bia\u0142owie\u017ca forest, \u201cdoes not run from humans; on the contrary, it\nstops when it is approached, and does not budge; it only attacks man when it\nis irritated, in which case it is fierce and dangerous.\u201d It seems that both\nspecies behaved similarly towards humans. When chased, hunt or confined, they\nwould become timid and shy, avoiding contacts with humans; when left to their\nown devices, they wouldn\u2019t be afraid of humans. So here we have two species\nthat behave similarly towards humans, eat the same, grow more or less at the\nsame rate (Bisons reach adulthood in 3 years, while cattle does in 2), can\nbreed while in captivity, have a more or less steady temperament (as long as\nyou do not come across as a bull fighter), and have exactly the same social\nhierarchy. They also seem to adapt quite rapidly to the presence of humans,\nswitching to a different social behaviour if they are chased or hunt. A\nsimilar situation has been reported with cattle that has been reintroduced to\nnatural reserves in the Netherlands, Poland, Romania and Spain. European bison\ncan be observed at very close range at Bia\u0142owie\u017ca forest and they seem to\nbehave exactly as they did 500 hundred years ago; if left alone, they would\ntolerate humans from a safe distance. Why is it then that Aurochs were\ndomesticated but European bison was not if, according to Diamond, any species\nwith the Anna Karenina Principle characteristics can, and has been\ndomesticated?\n\nEuropean Bison minding their own business at Bia\u0142owie\u017ca forest, Poland. Image\ncourtesy of Wild Poland.\n\nDiamond offers further evidence to support the Anna Karenina principle by\narguing that cultural obstacles against domestication cannot be put forward\nfor the following reasons:\n\n\u201c... [the] rapid acceptance of Eurasian domesticates by non-Eurasian peoples,\nthe universal human penchant for keeping pets, the rapid domestication of the\nancient fourteen, the repeated independent domestications, and the limited\nsuccesses of modern efforts at further domestication\u201d (p. 176)\n\nThe first thing I have to say is that if I thought that Diamond\u2019s original\nargument was weak, here I think that he is in even shakier and muddier\nterritory. Once more, we can see here Diamond\u2019s penchant for sweep\ngeneralisations at work. Let\u2019s break and dissect the above paragraph:\n\n  * Rapid acceptance of Eurasian domesticates by non-Eurasian peoples\n\n  * The universal human penchant for keeping pets\n\n  * The rapid domestication of the ancient fourteen\n\n  * The repeated independent domestications\n\n  * The limited success of modern efforts at further domestication\n\nRapid acceptance of Eurasian domesticates by non-Eurasian peoples: Here\nDiamond seems to confuse adoption with imposition. I do not want to expand too\nmuch on this because I personally believe that the victim argument used by the\npolitical left has been over-exploited. This does not mean that is not\npartially correct. In the process of enforcing the land grab that we call the\nDiscovery of the Americas, the traditional ways of life of Native Americans\nwere profoundly modified, when not completely annihilated. The whole process\nwas merely a forced acculturation. Diamond\u2019s argument of rapid acceptance of\nthe Eurasian domesticates is tantamount to say that the swift spread of\nCatholicism among native peoples in the Americas was a divine sign of its\nrighteousness; or that the adoption of the conquerors\u2019 languages is a sign of\nthe superiority of Indo-European languages over the local languages.\n\nI would also add here that the \u201csuccess\u201d and wide adoption of Eurasian\ndomesticates in the Americas is also a function of ecological fitness. The\ndisappearance of Megafauna in the Americas, either caused by overkill or\nclimate related changes in the ecosystem, left huge vacant expanses ready to\nbe occupied by new, large ruminants such as domestic cattle, horses or sheep.\nThat was the case in the Argentinian Pampas, where feral horses spread like\nfire once they were brought from Europe and accidentally escaped their\nenclosures. Likewise, the hunt of American bison and their consequent\ndwindling numbers in the large expanses of North America left a vacant niche\nready to be occupied by Eurasian cattle.4\n\nFinally, the adoption of the horse by Natives in North America may have been\nmore of a survival adaptation to the constant encroaching of European\ncolonists than the gracious acceptance of an alien animal as a mean of\ntransport. I always find amusing the obsession of the Western world with\nanimals as beasts of burden, when there are myriads of examples from ancient\nsocieties across the world of large scale engineering feats where no animals\nwere used as aid. Think for example of the Easter Island Moais, or the\nconstruction of Machu Picchu or the Mayan monuments in Mesoamerica. We usually\ndeclare these monuments as engineering mysteries. One has only to see a map of\nthe Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan, and appreciate that the canals and chinampas\n(small orchards) were a very elegant solution to the logistical problems of a\nbig city devoid of other means of transport.\n\nThe first European map of Tenochtitlan, published in Nuremberg in 1524. Author\nunknown. Image in the public domain.\n\nThe universal human penchant for keeping pets: Diamond assumes here that all\nhuman societies see animals as an accessory to whatever is that humans do.\nThey are either food, companion or amusement. Not long ago, we used to parade\nhuman beings with deformities or disabilities as amusing objects from a\ncabinet of curiosities too. But anthropological research in South America has\nshown that: \u201cindigenous Amazonians don\u2019t domesticate animals because it\ndoesn\u2019t make any sense to them.\u201d5 Furthermore, many aboriginal peoples, and\nthis is particularly so in the Amazonian context, believe that animals (both\npredator and prey) are people. According to this logic, there is a profound\ndilemma in eating something that, like us, has a soul. It may also have\nconsequences. In the Amazon basin, even the ubiquitous dog was absent as a pet\nuntil the 20th Century. So, despite the profuse presence of pets among the\nAmazonian tribes, this cannot be taken as a precursor to domestication.\n\nFurthermore, Native Americans, who never experienced horses or cattle prior to\nthe European arrival, may have not seen these species as they would see the\nones that conform their cosmography. Horses may have been seen as extensions\nof the Europeans, with no ontological connection to their system of beliefs.\n\nThe rapid domestication of the ancient fourteen: it is true that most of the\nspecies described by Diamond were domesticated in the last 10000 years, but\nthis is also true for almost everything related to modern humans: Agriculture,\nsedentarism, writing, religion, all occurred within the last 10000 years. As a\ncounter argument, we can say that dogs were domesticated way before that, and\nas not much occurred outside this 10000 years, it is really a poor argument in\nfavour of domestication.\n\nThe repeated independent domestications: This is another area where Diamond\nperforms poorly, with a particular use of cherry-picking to enhance his\nargument. He mentions the domestication of cattle in India, Southwest Asia\nand, possibly North Africa as a proof of independent domestications. But with\nthe exception of Southwest Asia, which I am completely ignorant of, I have\nbeen told countless of times while reading Guns, Germs and Steel that Eurasia\nis a single landmass that has facilitated the spread of animals, technologies\nand plants. Diamond has also explicitly written in his book that he considers\nNorth Africa part of Eurasia. So, why does he treat Eurasia as a singularity\nin some cases, as in the continental axis hypothesis, but breaks it up when it\nsuits his argument, as in domestication? Isn\u2019t the domestication of Aurochs in\nIndia, or in Europe part of the same story? That of the superiority of the\nEurasian peoples, partly due to the axis orientation and so on? How\nindependent are these domestication events? What about examples of repeated\ndomestications outside Eurasia? None worth mentioning in Africa, the Americas\nor Oceania? The multiple domestication of dogs both in Eurasia and in the\nAmericas is also a very disputed argument, as ancient DNA studies have shown\nthat the dog entered with humans to the Americas. This does not preclude the\ndomestication of American species (way too complicated to cover succinctly\nhere), but it does qualify domestication of the dog in the Americas to the\nfact that Paleoindians already had a coevolutionary relationship with wolves\nprior to the entry to the Americas.\n\nThe limited success of modern efforts at further domestication: Here I have to\ngo back to the bison/Aurochs dichotomy. Diamond dodges the bison issue by\nliterally omitting the European bison from his chapter on domestication\naltogether, and mentioning American bison only four times. What does he say\nabout the American bison? Literally nothing:\n\n\u201cIn the 19th and 20th centuries at least six large mammals\u2014the eland, elk,\nmoose, musk ox, zebra, and American bison\u2014have been the subjects of especially\nwell-organized projects aimed at domestication, carried out by modern\nscientific animal breeders and geneticists. For example, eland, the largest\nAfrican antelope, have been undergoing selection for meat qual- ity and milk\nquantity in the Askaniya-Nova Zoological Park in the Ukraine, as well as in\nEngland, Kenya, Zimbabwe, and South Africa; an experimental farm for elk (red\ndeer, in British terminology) has been operated by the Rowett Research\nInstitute at Aberdeen, Scotland; and an experimental farm for moose has\noperated in the Pechero-Ilych National Park in Russia. Yet these modern\nefforts have achieved only very limited successes. While bison meat\noccasionally appears in some U.S. supermarkets, and while moose have been\nridden, milked, and used to pull sleds in Sweden and Russia, none of these\nefforts has yielded a result of sufficient economic value to attract many\nranchers.\u201d (p. 180) My emphasis.\n\nSo, basically he is admitting, reluctantly though, that the issue with these\nprograms is not that they have failed, but rather, that they haven\u2019t attracted\nsufficient interest from farmers due to economic reasons. So, yes, according\nto this logic, they are of limited success, but how can he cite this as\nsupport for the Anna Karenina principle? Isn\u2019t the occasional presence of\nbison meat in the supermarkets proof that bison can and have been successfully\ndomesticated? The species may still look pretty much as the wild form that\nonce roamed the prairies in their millions, but this is because the heavily\ndomesticated forms of cattle that we grow as food have taken thousands of\nyears to materialise, and even so, some specific breeds still resemble the\nprimeval traits of the ancient Aurochs. Next time you see a Toro de Lidia, the\nSpanish fighter bull, pay attention to the specific shape of the horns and the\nathletic figure. That animal is an Aurochs in miniature, particularly at young\nage. Is it a coincidence then that this cattle breed has been particularly\nchosen due to his temperament for the Corridas de Toros? It seems to me that\nthis is an ancient trait that survived in the remoteness and inaccessibility\nof the Iberian countryside and, once discovered, has been preserved not for\nfood but for entertainment, rather than developed in the modern sense?\n\nI want to finish this essay by asking one question about domestication that\nbothers me the most: what if we have been chosen by few, or ALL these\ndomesticated species as a survival strategy? In other words, who has been\ndomesticated here? I cannot stop thinking about that nasty parasitic fungus\n(Ophiocordyceps unilateralis) that transforms ants into zombies, the fruity\norgan protruding from the ant\u2019s brain while still alive and conscious, when I\nsee people walking their pets on the streets. Think about it, here you are in\nfront of the most successful predator you have ever come across (humans), your\nchances of surviving this onslaught are truly slim; there is no chance to hide\nor run. What do you do? Do you let your pride to drag you to your tomb, or do\nyou adapt? By offering to humans what they want, these species may have had\nincreased their chances of survival enormously. They offer us proteins,\ncompany, assistance, early warning, transport, and so on; in turn they are\nshowered with food, protection against predators and diseases, and plenty of\nhabitats where to thrive.\n\nThis is even more obvious in our symbiotic relationship with dogs and cats,\nwho most likely were attracted to human settlements by food waste and/or prey,\nas it\u2019s the case of high rodent concentrations around grain storage. In both\ncases, humans may have neither elicited the contact, nor displayed any direct\nintention of domesticating the species. Only with time, this coevolutionary\nprocess would end up benefitting both species, when humans realised that wolfs\ncould help them track and hunt large herds of herbivores, and cats could\nalleviate the loses caused by rodents. This, of course, is all speculative as\nthere is no evidence to support it, but in India, Leopards are now attracted\nto large cities by the abundance of stray dogs; it remains to be seen if\nhumans will tolerate leopard\u2019s presence in a not-too-distant future to\nmaintain strays populations in check.\n\n1\n\nDiamond, J. 2017.
