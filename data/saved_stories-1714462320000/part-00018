But books\nhave all sorts of ancillary stuff going on in the front, the back, and the\nmargins. Sometimes we pay attention to it, other times not. But there are\noccasionally treasures in the bits we ignore.\n\nPhoto by Anastasia Zhenina on Unsplash\n\n\u00b6 This one goes out to . . . Dedications typically follow the copyright page\nand sometimes even sit atop it when space is short. But author Jonathan Lethem\nsays people are surprisingly incurious about them.\n\nWhen it comes to his books, interviewers have asked Lethem about everything:\nthe content, who endorsed it, the author photo, jacket design, and more. But\nnot the dedication. Yet there are endless considerations in a dedication, he\nsays. He offers some of the questions a dedication prompts in his mind, along\nwith his own answers:\n\n> Why this person, how\u2019d you decide, was it easy or hard? (Often hard.\n> Sometimes easy.) Are you trying to apologize, or right a wrong? (There are\n> better avenues for that.) Do you worry about fairness? (Hopeless to even\n> begin.) Why dad, not mom? (I do love mom, but she\u2019s gone, dad\u2019s here. Dead-\n> ications seem like wasted gestures.) Have you developed rules, as you go\n> along dedicating books across the years? (The dedication should be to\n> someone you could actually imagine enjoying the book in question.) . . . Is\n> a book \u201cto\u201d or \u201cfor\u201d someone, and why? (I prefer \u201cfor.\u201d Nations dedicate\n> themselves \u201cto\u201d causes or programs, scaring the s*** out of me. \u201cFor\u201d feels\n> more like the act of one person handing a book to another.)\n\nUsing very few words, dedications can speak many.\n\n\u00b6 A natural history of dedications. The practice of adding a dedication to a\nwork goes back at least as far as the Romans. Pliny the Elder, for instance,\ndedicated his Natural History to Emperor Titus Vespasian. \u201cThis treatise on\nNatural History, a novel work in Roman literature, which I have just\ncompleted, I have taken the liberty to dedicate to you, most gracious\nEmperor,\u201d he says before heaping line after line of obsequious praise on the\nemperor\u2014which, I suppose, is the usual sort of praise one heaps upon an\nemperor.\n\n\u201cAd Titvm Vespasiani. . .\u201d Dedicatory page from 15th-century copy of Pliny\u2019s\nNatural History.\n\nPliny wasn\u2019t alone. Ancient and medieval authors dedicated books to patrons or\npotential patrons as a way either of publicly expressing gratitude for their\nsupport or boldly fishing for a job. Often these dedications took on the form\nof lengthy addresses. After all, one\u2019s livelihood depended on the work\u2019s\nreception\u2014not by the public at large but, rather, by the the patron. Better\nsmear it on thick.\n\nBy the time we get to the modern era, however, patronage was mostly out as\nmeans of support. Dedications hung on, but their meaning and length changed.\nDedications mostly morphed into short expressions of gratitude or affection\nfor one or more persons who contributed directly or indirectly to a work\u2014good\nvibes or, as Ivan Doig says, quoted by Addison Rizer in a brief history of\ndedications, a \u201cblack and white valentine.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 The pressure to get it right. Authors can feel a lot of pressure with a\ndedication. It may be \u201cjust some soppy, private transaction of the heart,\u201d as\nnovelist Tim Dowling says, but \u201ca dedication is [also] meant to be a permanent\nmemorial.\u201d\n\nThere it is, isolated on its own page, singular, set apart, forever. But what\nif the author\u2019s relationship to the dedicatee changes? I dedicated my first\nbook to my first wife. The book had a better conclusion than the marriage. I\nnow have mixed feelings whenever I see it. Likewise, Dowling mentions the case\nof Australian author Peter Carey, one of only five writers to win the Booker\nPrize twice, who caused a stir when he tried \u201cto have all the dedications to\nhis ex-wife expunged from future editions of his novels. . . .\u201d\n\nWhile I\u2019ve only married one other woman, I have written several other books,\nand I\u2019ve dedicated those to my love, my children, my parents, and my paternal\ngrandparents. Why not my maternal grandparents? I might have subconsciously\nbeen following Lethem\u2019s rule about the living and the dead.\n\nThose choices are pretty typical, boringly so if we\u2019re honest. \u201cIn a study . .\n. of 600 book dedications analyzed with 812 dedicatees,\u201d says Rizer, \u201croughly\n17% were parents, 8% were wives/husbands, followed by teachers, children, and\nfriends.\u201d\n\nPhilosopher Aaron James dedicated one of his books to his parents. The title?\nA**holes: A Theory. So, we\u2019re left wondering, who was worse, Mom or Dad?\nSurely, that reading was unintentional. Then again, the joke is sometimes the\nentire point.\n\n\u00b6 Offered with a wink. For the clever, a dedication provides a place to\nexpress a bit of humor. For instance, Alan Stevens and James Lowe dedicate\ntheir rivetingly titled textbook Pathology\n\n> to the wine makers of Chateau Batailley (Bordeaux), Chateau Angludet\n> (Bordeaux), Brown Bros Chardonnay (Australia), Robert Mondavi Cabernet\n> Sauvignon (California) without whose help the preparation of this book could\n> have been a real drag, and also to the Staff of the University Staff Club,\n> University of Nottingham, who kept us cheerfully supplied with much of the\n> above.\n\nFor their book, Nice Is Just a Place in France: How to Win at Basically\nEverything, the Betches comedy collective thanks \u201cXanax, for getting us\nthrough those anxiety-ridden meetings with publishers,\u201d as well as \u201cAdderall,\nwithout which we\u2019d probably still be trying to figure out how to make a\nwebsite.\u201d\n\nIn place of a dedication, Piper CJ\u2019s The Night and Its Moon features this\npossibly real, likely fake exchange between the author and . . . who? Maybe\nthe editor:\n\nFrom Piper CJ, The Night and Its Moon\n\nSometimes dedications subvert the form by undercutting the objects of their\nsupposed affection with a passive-aggressive swipe. For his critically\nacclaimed memoir about his troubled youth, This Boy\u2019s Life, Tobias Wolff\noffers a backhanded dedication: \u201cMy first stepfather used to say that what I\ndidn\u2019t know would fill a book. Well, here it is.\u201d\n\nOther times, the jab is more of a tease. P.G. Wodehouse dedicated Heart of a\nGoof \u201cTo my daughter Leonora without whose never-failing sympathy and\nencouragement this book would have been finished in half the time.\u201d1 The same\njoke occurred to mathematician Joseph Rotman when dedicating An Introduction\nto Algebraic Topology:\n\n> To my wife Marganit and my children Ella Rose and Daniel Adam without whom\n> this book would have been completed two years earlier\n\nTim Dowling mentions Rupert Morgan\u2019s playful dedication in Let There Be Lite.\nIt\u2019s similar to those by Wodehouse and Rotman but with a bit more bite:\n\u201cThanks to my adored wife, without whose unquestioning faith and support this\nbook was nevertheless written.\u201d\n\nActually, scratch that. Dowling says he falsely remembered it as a dedication;\nit was, in fact, part of the acknowledgements. What\u2019s the difference?\n\n\u00b6 Credit and blame. Acknowledgements are designed to give credit where it\u2019s\ndue. No author writes a book utterly from scratch. Ideas come from other\npeople, including other authors; as Cormac McCarthy told the New York Times,\n\u201cThe ugly fact is books are made out of books.\u201d Acknowledgments give authors a\nchance to publicly state their dependence on the world beyond their favorite\nwriting nook.\n\nSometimes expressions of gratitude are personal, such as Morgan\u2019s. Other times\nthey note the those individuals and institutions who supported the work. In\nthis sense, we\u2019re back to the classical and medieval period; we\u2019ve just broken\nthe dedicatory letter in two and placed some of it right after the copyright\npage in the form of the dedication and reserved some of it for later in the\nbook in the form of the acknowledgments.\n\nAcknowledgments can float; sometimes you\u2019ll find them up front, other times in\nthe back. Whereever you might find them, I recommend reading them.\nAcknowledgments are a good way to understand more about where an author is\ncoming from and the network of people and influences that helped birth the\nbook. \u201cAcknowledgments capture the real-life intimacies of the literary world\nand lay bare the backdrop of the writing process,\u201d says Ayden Leroux.2\n\nThere\u2019s also an art to well-done acknowledgements with perhaps even more\npressure than a dedication. Writes Stuart Evers,\n\n> While I know the text is supposed to be the most important thing, and I\u2019m\n> well aware that the biographical details of a writer\u2019s life should be\n> incidental to the reading experience, the acknowledgement pages can have a\n> subtle effect on the way I read a book. . . . I can\u2019t help but slightly\n> judge an author by the way they acknowledge their debts: too effusive and\n> they seem a bit needy and try-hard; too brief\u2014a list of names in\n> alphabetical order\u2014and you run the risk of appearing cold and dismissive.\n> It\u2019s probably the difficulty of treading such a fine line that makes me read\n> long lists of names of people I have never met.\n\nSays Leroux,\n\n> Writing is reading and researching, walking and thinking, speaking and\n> silence, listening and questioning. Writing needs pleasure and relaxation,\n> just as it requires the drudgery of the daily: emails, groceries, laundry,\n> calendars. Writing needs the ache and \u00e9lan of living that teaches us our own\n> capacities and breaking points. Acknowledgments have the ability to expose\n> that living.\n\nI could rehearse several examples from authors I think have done it well\u2014that\ncapture the high-wire act of Evers or the elevated revelations of Leroux\u2014but\nnah! Instead, let\u2019s look at someone who breaks the form and delivers perhaps\nthe greatest acknowledgments page of all time, B.M. Pietsch in Dispensational\nModernism.\n\nShort and not so sweet. From B.M. Pietsch, Dispensational Modernism.\n\n\u00b6 Duly noted. Finally, let\u2019s consider the footnote and their often-maligned\nsiblings, endnotes. If acknowledgments give a reader a broad sense of how a\nbook came together, footnotes and endnotes reveal the individual ingredients;\nthey provide a peek into the source code. They also allow a writer to add\nobservations or share details that warrant attention but don\u2019t quite fit\nwithin the flow of the text.\n\nAs with dedications, including supplemental notes alongside the main body of a\ntext goes back a long way. We find in medieval manuscripts, for instance,\nscholia and other forms of commentary arranged in the margin around the main\ntext\u2014as with this sixteenth-century copy of Hesiod\u2018s Theogony ringed with\ncommentary by John Tzetzes.\n\n\u201cCan we say any more about this?\u201d Hesiod\u2018s Theogony surrounded by commentary\nfrom John Tzetzes.\n\nBut it\u2019s a stretch from surrounding a text with an invading army of opinions\nto the sort of ancillary sort of discrete observations and source\nacknowledgment we recognize today. You can see how we got there, however, by\nlooking at transitional forms, such as this page from the Geneva Bible, an\nearly English translation especially valued\u2014and, depending on the audience,\nloathed\u2014for its notes.\n\nFrom the Geneva Bible, Book of Numbers.\n\n\u00b6 At the bottom or the back? Taken individually, footnotes can shed light on a\nwriter\u2019s scholarship. Taken collectively, however, they help tell the history\nof scholarship itself and even that of the publishing business. For instance,\nwhat do we make of the shift from footnotes, which sit directly below the\nprimary text and endnotes which shunt all that erudition to the rear of the\nbook?\n\n\u201cThe decline of the footnote has been linked to changes in the publishing\nbusiness,\u201d says Bruce Anderson, referring to the trend back in 1997.\n\n> College libraries, corseted by budget squeezes, are no longer the principal\n> buyers for the books produced by some academic presses. These books are now\n> packaged to attract a broader audience, the [New York] Times says, with\n> \u201dcatchier titles, snappier covers, more and better illustrations and fewer\n> footnotes and bibliographies.\u201d\n>\n> Some books have dropped the annotations altogether and others have simply\n> moved them from the bottom of the page to the end of chapters or the back of\n> the book where they are properly called endnotes.\n\nA certain kind of reader will howl at this move. I get it. Flipping to the\nback is particularly annoying when reading a text for which the notes are an\nessential part of the experience. Noel Coward complained that reading\nfootnotes is like \u201chaving to go downstairs to answer the door while in the\nmidst of making love.\u201d With endnotes it\u2019s more like walking to the end of the\ndriveway.\n\nThen again, excessive notation can clog the text and slow the reading\nexperience. By relegating the noise to the back, endnotes permit a more fluid\nreading experience. Life is, alas, nothing but tradeoffs.\n\n\u00b6 Snide aside. Footnotes also provide the perfect place for the snide aside.\nTake a famous example from Edward Gibbon\u2019s Decline and Fall of the Roman\nEmpire. In the main text, Gibbon makes a winking, oblique reference to the\nclaim Origen of Alexandria had castrated himself. \u201cThe primitive church was\nfilled with a great number of persons of either sex, who had devoted\nthemselves to the profession of perpetual chastity,\u201d he says. \u201cA few of these,\namong whom we may reckon the learned Origen, judged it the most prudent to\ndisarm the tempter.\u201d\n\nGibbon can\u2019t resist a gibe, so to that last bit he appends a footnote both\nciting Eusebius as the source for the mutilative detail and to nudge the joke\na bit further. \u201cAs it was his general practice to allegorize scripture,\u201d he\nsays, \u201cit seems unfortunate that, in this instance only, he should have\nadopted the literal sense.\u201d He trusts the reader knows the passage in\nquestion\u2014Christ\u2019s advice to pluck out one\u2019s eye and lop off one\u2019s hand if they\nlead an individual to sin.\n\nIn Flash Boys, journalist Michael Lewis offers another example, less snide\nthan merely humorous.\n\nWhat\u2019s in a name? From Michael Lewis, Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt\n\n\u00b6 Revealed in a dream? Normally, authors cite their sources to (a) let readers\nknow where they got their ideas and (b) point us to those sources so we can\ncheck them ourselves. Sometimes (a) is frustrated by incompleteness; whereas\n(b) might be frustrated by the obscurity or inaccessibility of the sources.\n\nNicolas Berdyaev gets the prize for frustrating both (a) and (b) while\nproviding one of the most delightful footnotes in publishing history. See note\n1 below from page 7 of his book The Divine and the Human: \u201cThis was once\nrevealed to me in a dream.\u201d Oh, was it now?\n\nNicolas Berdyaev footnotes his . . . dream?\n\nThe quote lives on in a bizarre and nichey afterlife. I\u2019ve heard of people\nhunting down copies of the 1949 book just for the footnote. You can find it on\nmemes. And, should the mood strike, you can buy a sticker of the note to adorn\nwhatever you desire.\n\nTed Gioia\n\napproves.\n\nBetter than the dog ate my homework.\n\nGiles Slade offers a much less daring\u2014though equally enjoyable\u2014endnote of a\nhard-to-source tidbit in American Exodus: Climate Change and the Coming Flight\nfor Survival. The best part? He mentions the keywords by which a person might\nfind the elusive article while announcing he can\u2019t be bothered to do so\nhimself.\n\n> This figure is from a New York Times article of the period, and will\n> probably show up if you search keywords for \u201cBarge Captain,\u201d \u201c1258 dead\n> horses,\u201d or \u201cBarren Island,\u201d in ProQuest Historical Newspapers.

If you can, then I thank you.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I tried the New York Times archive and couldn\u2019t turn up\nanything.\n\n\u00b6 Make it count. I've written four books at this point. For kicks, I once\nadded up the number of endnotes in each. Here\u2019s the breakdown:\n\n  * Bad Trip (2004): 587 notes\n\n  * Size Matters (2006): 322 notes\n\n  * The Revolutionary Paul Revere (2010): 522 notes\n\n  * Lifted by Angels (2012): 414 notes\n\nThat\u2019s a total of 1,845 notes with an average per book of 461.3\n\nThanks for reading!
