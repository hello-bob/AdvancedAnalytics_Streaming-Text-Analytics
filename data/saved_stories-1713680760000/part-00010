Even though it can be scary. We all understand that\nwe\u2019ve been given a gift by being born, by living past infancy, by being born\nfree\u2014no guarantee, especially back in ancient Greece and Rome.\n\nThe Stoics would talk about life and our possessions as something that is ours\n\u2018only in trust.\u2019 Meaning that at some point we must relinquish them, that they\ncan be taken back from us, returned to whomever or whatever gave them to us in\nthe first place.\n\nThis language mirrors the heartbreaking phrase that sometimes appears in the\nwriting of Jake Seliger, whom we had on the podcast a few months back. If you\nrecall, Jake was shocked to find that he had squamous cell carcinoma, and that\nhis prognosis was almost certainly terminal. Not just terminal...but quickly\nso. The interview was a very moving one, in part because Jake, reeling from\nmultiple surgeries, quite obviously struggled even to speak.\n\nIn his writings since his diagnosis\u2014sometimes with happy news about progress\nin various drug trials, sometimes in frustrations over bureaucracy\u2014Jake had\nhad to wrestle with his looming mortality. \u201cIn computer science there is a\nconvention in which one\u2019s first program prints \u2018Hello, world,\u2019\u201d he writes in\none of his essays. \u201cNow it is my turn to write \u2018Goodbye, world.\u2019 I\u2019m crying as\nI write this and am sorry to have to go so soon. I have to give back the gift,\nthough with great sadness.\u201d\n\nAs wonderful as life is, we do not actually possess it, not fully anyway. No\nmatter how powerful or important or rich or healthy we are. Marcus Aurelius\ngot this lesson as he buried one child after another and then faced it himself\nwhen he died of the plague which would come to bear his name. The emperor\nmight have seemed like a god, but in the end, he was a mortal man like the\nrest of us. Indeed, every Stoic who was ever born had to give back the gift,\nevery person who was ever born will. None of us will be exempted from this\nrule.\n\nAll we can do is play with and enjoy and respect the gift while we have it.\nAnd help others do the same.\n\nLike all of us, Jake cannot escape the fortunes that fate has planned for him.\nBut he is not alone in that fate. We are all interconnected and part of the\nsame larger organism, the Stoic concept of Sympatheia reminds us, and so must\nlook out for one another as much as we can.\n\nTogether we can try to give Jake every last minute he deserves with his wife\nand family.
