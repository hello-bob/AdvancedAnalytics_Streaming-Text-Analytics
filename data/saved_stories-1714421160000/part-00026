Since the rise of social media,\nTwitter stood out as the preferred platform of our Research and Education\ncommunity and as a fitting solution for G\u00c9ANT \u2013 one mixing insightful content\nwith lighter tones and personal elements, representing the official voice of\norganisations, policy makers and influential figures, often sparking\nmeaningful discussions among news, chatter, memes and the usual funny videos\nof cats and dogs.\n\nHowever, not much of this is left now. In the past two years, we have seen\nTwitter go through radical transformations, changed ownership, morphing into X\nand into a completely different platform which increasingly amplifies hate\nspeech, fake news, scams, extreme views, and illegal content. Verification\nbadges that were once a symbol of trust have lost all meaning, essential\nfeatures were dropped or limited to paying users, and costs seem to have been\ncut at the expense of security, privacy, and content moderation. We have\nclosely observed these developments with growing concern and concluded that\nthe X platform is now irreparably misaligned with our values.\n\n## The X-it of the R&E community\n\nWe are not the only organisation in our community to have noticed this drift\neither. In a parallel analysis, the Dutch NREN SURF came to similar\nconclusions and is also set to leave X/Twitter on 2 May 2024. You can find\ntheir official announcement here: https://www.surf.nl/en/news/surf-stops-\nusing-x-twitter\n\nAmong European NRENs, the Norwegian Sikt had also announced their X-it in\nNovember 2023, the Luxembourgish Restena pointed their followers towards other\nsocial media platforms, while other NRENs have consistently decreased or\nceased their activities on X. Many more are the research infrastructures,\ne-infrastructures, universities, and libraries that recently announced their\nX-its, such as the German National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), the\nUniversity of Innsbruck, the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles, Rennes 2\nUniversity, the Helmholtz Open Science Office, to name a few. Researchers\nlargely reduced their use of X/Twitter as well, as reported in a survey\npublished by Nature on 16 August 2023, leaving the communities once known as\n\u201cScience Twitter\u201d and \u201cAcademic Twitter\u201d scattered across different social\nmedia platforms.\n\nObserved from the perspective of G\u00c9ANT profiles, this ongoing exodus of users\nand of community members and organisations has also been evident and showing\nsigns of acceleration, as is a consistent decrease of engagement with G\u00c9ANT\ncontent. With both our community and potential audience mostly out of X\nalready, there is now little value left in using the platform for G\u00c9ANT\u2019s\nactivities altogether.\n\n## Our X-it strategy\n\nOur decision to X-it will take effect on the main G\u00c9ANT profiles as GEANTnews\nand TNC_GEANT, while for X profiles related to our projects, we will discuss\nwith partners in order to take joint decisions on the way forward.\n\nTo prevent theft and misuse of our X handles and identities, we will not shut\ndown G\u00c9ANT profiles but simply cease all activities, with the exception of\noccasional posts driving followers towards our social media accounts on other\nplatforms, also aimed at keeping our accounts active and avoiding their\nremoval.\n\nG\u00c9ANT will of course keep being active on other social media channels, in\nparticular LinkedIn (currently our primary social media channel), and Mastodon\n(the rising decentralised social media part of the Fediverse, where G\u00c9ANT is\nactive together with SURF, DFN, NORDUnet, RENATER, SUNET, Restena).\n\nFollow us there, if you aren\u2019t already doing it: LinkedIn:\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/GEANTnetworks Mastodon:\nhttps://mstdn.social/@geant\n\nTagsSocial Media\n\n#### You may also like\n\nCommunity News\n\n## Kusha: Empowering Researchers through Social Media for Knowledge\nDissemination\n\n5 days ago\n\nCommunity News \u2022 Featured \u2022 TNC\n\n## TNC24 Community Hub \u2013 bigger and better!\n\n6 days ago\n\nCommunity News \u2022 EOSC \u2022 Open Science\n\n## Introducing EOSC Beyond: Spearheading the Evolution of the European Open\nScience Cloud\n\n1 week ago\n\nCommunity News \u2022 Events \u2022 TNC\n\n## Save the date!
