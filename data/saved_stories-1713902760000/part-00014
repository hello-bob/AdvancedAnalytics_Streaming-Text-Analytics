Then, in late 2020, he received a LinkedIn message\nfrom a recruiter for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Bruce read up\non TSMC \u2014 the leading global manufacturer of advanced chips \u2014 and got excited.\nThe job sounded like he\u2019d be \u201cpushing the boundaries of human technology,\u201d he\nrecalled to Rest of World.\n\nTSMC was undergoing a transformation at just about the same time Bruce heard\nfrom the recruiter. The coronavirus pandemic was exposing deep faults in\nsupply chains, and a global chip shortage had slowed production of cars,\nsmartphones, and refrigerators around the world. Meanwhile, American\npolicymakers were rallying around what would eventually become the CHIPS and\nScience Act, a sweeping piece of legislation designed to boost semiconductor\nmanufacturing in the U.S. TSMC, which makes most of its chips in Taiwan, was\nunder pressure to expand its global manufacturing capacities.\n\nBruce would be working as a semiconductor engineer. The recruiter explained\nthat he would first spend more than a year in Taiwan learning the ins and outs\nof the complex chipmaking process. Then, he\u2019d return to Arizona. There, in a\ncactus-dotted suburb of Phoenix, TSMC was building a sprawling new factory to\nmake the kind of chips that power iPhones and U.S. fighter jets. He\u2019d be\nhelping bring America\u2019s newest chip factory online. Bruce was in.\n\nBut over the next two years, Bruce came to realize that the reality of working\nat TSMC wasn\u2019t exactly what he had envisioned. While working on nanometer-\nlevel processes to make state-of-the-art chips, he struggled with language\nbarriers, long hours, and a strict hierarchy. Bruce soon began second-guessing\nwhat he had signed up for. The plant, which was originally set to begin\noperating in 2024, fell woefully behind schedule; production at the facility\nis now set to start in 2025. Bruce, who said he signed a confidentiality\nagreement with TSMC, requested anonymity for this story.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t the only one disappointed with TSMC\u2019s progress in Arizona \u2014 other\nU.S. workers who spoke to Rest of World echoed Bruce\u2019s concerns. In the past\ntwo years, the company has relocated hundreds of Taiwanese workers and their\nfamilies to Arizona. Instead of a gleaming new facility, these workers found\nan active construction site, and a company struggling to bridge Taiwanese and\nAmerican professional and cultural norms.\n\nOver the past four months, Rest of World spoke with more than 20 current and\nformer TSMC employees \u2014 from the U.S. and Taiwan \u2014 at the Arizona plant. All\nof them requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the\nmedia or because they feared retaliation from the company. In February, Rest\nof World traveled to Phoenix to visit the growing TSMC complex and spend time\nwith the nascent community of transplanted Taiwanese engineers.\n\nThe American engineers complained of rigid, counterproductive hierarchies at\nthe company; Taiwanese TSMC veterans described their American counterparts as\nlacking the kind of dedication and obedience they believe to be the foundation\nof their company\u2019s world-leading success.\n\nSome 2,200 employees now work at TSMC\u2019s Arizona plant, with about half of them\ndeployed from Taiwan. While tension at the plant simmers, TSMC has been\nramping up its investments, recently securing billions of dollars in grants\nand loans from the U.S. government. Whether or not the plant succeeds in\nmaking cutting-edge chips with the same speed, efficiency, and profitability\nas facilities in Asia remains to be seen, with many skeptical about a U.S.\nworkforce under TSMC\u2019s army-like command system. \u201c[The company] tried to make\nArizona Taiwanese,\u201d G. Dan Hutcheson, a semiconductor industry analyst at the\nresearch firm TechInsights, told Rest of World. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just not going to\nwork.\u201d\n\nTSMC did not respond to a detailed list of questions from Rest of World.\n\nTSMC\u2019s glass-walled office building at the construction site on the outskirts\nof northern Phoenix in March 2024.\n\nTSMC\u2019s facilities are located on the outskirts of northern Phoenix, surrounded\nby miles of desert hills and wide roads. A glass-walled office building sits\nnext to a massive parking lot, with a fountain in the shape of a round silicon\nwafer just in front of the facility gates.\n\nNext to the office building are the incomplete manufacturing facilities.\nOriginally slated to open in 2024, the facilities resemble giant stadiums.\nOnce complete, the entire complex will cover 1,100 acres, or the equivalent of\n625 football fields.\n\nAt lunch hour on a Monday in February, Taiwanese and American engineers walked\nin and out of the office building with badges, hard hats, and see-through\nbackpacks \u2014 which make it easier and faster for workers to pass through\nsecurity checks.\n\nTSMC got its start thousands of miles away from Arizona\u2019s arid desert \u2014 on the\nnorthern coast of Taiwan. Morris Chang, a U.S.-educated chip engineer who\nspent 25 years at Texas Instruments, founded the company in 1987. He did so at\nthe invitation of the Taiwanese government, which was eager to boost the\nisland\u2019s economy at the time.\n\nMorris Chang, founder of TSMC, speaks at the company\u2019s facility in Phoenix in\n2022. Adriana Zehbrauskas/The New York Times/Redux\n\nIn the 1980s, companies like Intel and Texas Instruments designed and made\ntheir own chips. TSMC set out to do something different. Chang\u2019s company would\nfocus solely on contract manufacturing: Customers would send designs, and\nengineers in the company\u2019s fabrication plants (also called \u201cfabs\u201d) worked to\nperfect production methods, minimize the number of defective chips, and reduce\ncosts.\n\nThe model proved a success. \u201cAll of a sudden it\u2019s really efficient,\u201d\nHutcheson, of TechInsights, told Rest of World. \u201cYou can learn to become a\nplumber. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s more efficient for you to focus on\nwhat you make money doing and then pay someone else to come do [the\nplumbing].\u201d\n\nOutlines are approximate and based on available data, including the Maricopa\nCounty Assessor\u2019s office and Rest of World reporting. Maps: Cengiz Yar/Joanne\nLee/Rest of World, Satellite image: 2024 Maxar Technologies/Getty Images\n\nMeanwhile, chip manufacturing collapsed in the U.S. and Europe, and migrated\nto East Asia, drawn by government incentives. Hutcheson said the high costs of\nbuilding new facilities prevented new companies from joining the competition\nand eventually solidified TSMC\u2019s dominance.\n\nTSMC has since grown into a $660 billion giant that has allowed \u201cfabless\u201d chip\ndesigners such as Nvidia and Apple to flourish. The company is now able to\ncram more computing power into less space than almost any other chip\nmanufacturer. Samsung and Intel are still trailing behind the Taiwanese\ncompany.\n\nTSMC is also considered Taiwan\u2019s most important company, with Taiwanese people\ndubbing it a \u201cdivine mountain that guards the nation.\u201d The world\u2019s dependence\non TSMC, locals reason, could even incentivize the West to defend Taiwan from\na potential invasion from China. The loss of Taiwan and with it TSMC \u2014 the\nthinking goes \u2014 would result in a global tech meltdown.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden walks with TSMC CEO C. C. Wei and Chairman Mark Liu\nduring a visit to the Arizona facility in 2022. Jonathan Ernst/Reuters/Redux\n\nTSMC insiders told Rest of World the key to the company\u2019s success is an\nintense, military-style work environment. Engineers work 12-hour days, and\nsometimes weekends too. Taiwanese commentators joke that the company runs on\nengineers with \u201cslave mentalities\u201d who \u201csell their livers\u201d \u2014 local slang that\nunderscores the intensity of the work.\n\nUp until the pandemic, it made sense for TSMC to concentrate its operations in\nTaiwan, where it enjoyed unwavering government support, low operating costs,\nand access to the island\u2019s top talents. Outside a small plant in Washington\nand two plants in mainland China that made chips with older technologies, the\ncompany had little interest in international expansion.\n\n> \"The world has changed.\"\n\nThat changed in the late 2010s, as governments came to realize the\ngeopolitical importance of the semiconductor industry and launched a race to\nattract chip manufacturing giants. Around 2019, the Trump administration\nstarted courting TSMC to build a larger and more advanced plant in the U.S.\nThe pandemic further underscored supply-chain weak points. \u201cThe world has\nchanged,\u201d Sujai Shivakumar, director of the Renewing American Innovation\nProject at the think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies, told\nRest of World. Depending on chips from a faraway country on China\u2019s doorstep\nsuddenly felt precarious. \u201cWhat was purely \u2014 from an economics point of view \u2014\nan efficient solution is no longer an efficient solution because of the\ngeopolitics,\u201d Shivakumar said.\n\nIn May 2020, then U.S. Under-Secretary of State Keith Krach announced that\nTSMC had agreed to open a $12 billion facility in Arizona. The site would\ncreate thousands of jobs, spur cutting-edge research, and attract more\ncompanies on the semiconductor supply chain to move to the U.S. Chips coming\nout of the plant were expected to power smartphones, 5G base stations, and\nadvanced F-35 fighter jets. \u201cThis means that chips critical to our lives and\nnational security will once again be made in America,\u201d Krach said.\n\nTSMC\u2019s investment, Krach later told U.S. media, inspired policymakers to\nextend incentives to the entire chip industry. In the summer of 2022, the\nBiden administration passed the CHIPS Act, which designated $53 billion to\ndeveloping the domestic semiconductor industry. Later that year, TSMC said it\nwould build a second fab at the same site in Phoenix, increasing its total\ninvestment to $40 billion.\n\nConstruction workers at the TSMC facility in Phoenix in 2022. Brendan\nSmialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDespite the commitment from both TSMC and Washington, issues related to\nexporting a Taiwanese-style work culture to the U.S. swirled from the outset.\nMorris Chang, who retired in 2018 but remains the public face of the company\nand the godfather of Taiwan\u2019s semiconductor industry, cast doubts on the\nPhoenix initiative.\n\nWhen Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in 2022, Chang lectured the House speaker on\nthe challenges the U.S. would face in mastering the microscopic precision\nrequired in chip production. Chang has since also warned against the lack of\nmanufacturing talent in the U.S., and how hard it would be for Taiwanese\nmanagers to supervise Americans. Speaking to the Vying for Talent podcast in\nApril 2022, Chang concluded that the U.S.\u2019 attempt to onshore semiconductor\nmanufacturing would be \u201ca very expensive exercise in futility.\u201d\n\nThe Phoenix site\u2019s first fabrication facility, emblazoned with the TSMC logo,\nas seen in March 2024. The facility is slated to begin production in 2025.\n\nIn 2021, as construction kicked off in Arizona, TSMC flew Bruce and about 600\nAmerican new hires to the southern Taiwanese coastal city of Tainan. There,\nthey\u2019d spend more than a year training at Fab 18, TSMC\u2019s most advanced mass\nproduction plant.\n\nUpon arriving at the facility, Bruce handed in his smartphone and passed\nthrough metal detectors. He was in awe of the semiconductor production line:\nOverhead rails carried wafers from one station to another while workers in\nwhite protective suits kept the machinery running. \u201cIt really just felt like I\nwas touring some kind of living thing that was greater than humans; that was\nbigger than us,\u201d Bruce recalled.\n\nBut the challenges were immediately apparent, too. At Fab 18, nearly all\ncommunication took place in Taiwanese and Mandarin Chinese, the two most\nwidely spoken languages in Taiwan. The Americans found it difficult to\nunderstand meetings, production guidelines, and chatter among local engineers.\nIn theory, every American was supposed to have a Taiwanese buddy \u2014 a future\nArizona worker who would help them navigate the workplace. But the Americans\nsaid their buddies were often too busy to help with translations, or else not\nfamiliar enough with the technical processes because they were freshly\ntransferred from other production lines.\n\nMany trainees, including Bruce, relied on Google Translate to get through the\nday, with mixed results. Technical terms and images were hard to decipher. One\nAmerican engineer said that because staff were not allowed to upload work\nmaterials to Google, he tried to translate documents by copying Chinese text\ninto a handwriting recognition program. It didn\u2019t work very well.\n\nOne former American TSMC engineer who trained in Taiwan said his manager\ninstructed him to follow along with daily handover meetings, which were\nconducted in Mandarin, just by looking at the associated PowerPoint\npresentations. \u201cI was mind-blown at his expectations,\u201d he told Rest of World.\n\u201cI love challenges and pushing myself, but this was lunatic-level leadership.\u201d\n\nTSMC\u2019s headquarters are located in Hsinchu City, Taiwan. Chris Stowers/Panos\nPictures/Redux\n\nTSMC\u2019s work culture is notoriously rigorous, even by Taiwanese standards.\nFormer executives have hailed the Confucian culture, which promotes diligence\nand respect for authority, as well as Taiwan\u2019s strict work ethic as key to the\ncompany\u2019s success. Chang, speaking last year about Taiwan\u2019s competitiveness\ncompared to the U.S., said that \u201cif [a machine] breaks down at one in the\nmorning, in the U.S. it will be fixed in the next morning. But in Taiwan, it\nwill be fixed at 2 a.m.\u201d And, he added, the wife of a Taiwanese engineer would\n\u201cgo back to sleep without saying another word.\u201d\n\nDuring their visit, the Americans got a taste of the company\u2019s intense work\nculture. To avoid intellectual property leaks, staff were banned from using\npersonal devices inside the factory. Instead, they were given company phones,\ndubbed \u201cT phones,\u201d that couldn\u2019t be connected to most messaging apps or social\nmedia. In one department, managers sometimes applied what they called \u201cstress\ntests\u201d by announcing assignments due the same day or week, to make sure the\nAmericans were able to meet tight deadlines and sacrifice personal time like\nTaiwanese workers, two engineers told Rest of World. Managers shamed American\nworkers in front of their peers, sometimes by suggesting they quit\nengineering, one employee said.\n\nTSMC made attempts to bridge some of the cultural differences. After the\nAmerican trainees asked to contact families and to listen to music at work,\nTSMC loosened the firewall on T phones to allow all staff access to Instagram,\nYouTube, and Spotify. Some Taiwanese workers attended a class on U.S. culture,\nwhere they learned that Americans responded better to encouragement rather\nthan criticism, according to an engineer who attended the session.\n\nWorkers gather for a ceremony at a TSMC facility in Tainan, Taiwan, as seen in\n2022. Lam Yik Fei/Bloomberg/Redux\n\nBut both American and Taiwanese engineers said that the training for new hires\nwas largely insufficient. Managers excluded Americans from higher-level\nmeetings conducted in Mandarin, according to one ex-TSMC engineer. Some of the\nAmericans said that they rarely had a chance to handle problems themselves,\nand were mostly tasked with observing. \u201cIt\u2019s like math in school,\u201d Bruce said.\n\u201cYou can watch your teacher do 500 practice problems on the chalkboard, but if\nyou don\u2019t do some problems on your own, you are going to fail the test.\u201d\n\nAs training went on, tensions mounted. U.S. engineers told Rest of World that\nsome Taiwanese male engineers had calendars with bikini models on their desks\nand occasionally shared sexual memes in group chats. A female American\ncolleague, according to an American trainee who witnessed the conversation,\nasked a Taiwanese engineer to remove his computer wallpaper depicting a bikini\nmodel. One former American engineer said some local co-workers referred to him\nas a \u201cwhite breeding pig,\u201d implying he was only in Taiwan to sleep with local\nwomen. At a meeting, a manager said Americans were less desirable than\nTaiwanese and Indian workers, according to people who saw leaked notes, which\ncirculated among trainees.\n\nA semiconductor wafer displayed at the TSMC museum in Taiwan in 2022. I-Hwa\nCheng/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThey really are trying to push this narrative that Americans are slower\nbecause of lower technical ability, but I really don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the\ntruth,\u201d an American engineer who recently left TSMC told Rest of World. \u201cThe\nTaiwanese create this false sense of urgency with every single task, and they\nreally push \u2018you need to finish everything immediately.\u2019 But it\u2019s just not\nrealistic for people that want to have some normal work-life balance.\u201d\n\nSeveral former American employees said they were not against working longer\nhours, but only if the tasks were meaningful. \u201cI\u2019d ask my manager \u2018What\u2019s your\ntop priority,\u2019 he\u2019d always say \u2018Everything is a priority,\u2019\u201d said another ex-\nTSMC engineer. \u201cSo, so, so, many times I would work overtime getting stuff\ndone only to find out it wasn\u2019t needed.\u201d\n\nTraining in Taiwan, which typically lasted one to two years, wasn\u2019t all\nmiserable, the Americans said. On the weekends, the trainees traveled across\nthe island, marveling at the country\u2019s highly efficient public transport\nnetwork. Bruce spent his weekends hiking and frequenting nightclubs. He\nchatted with the families that run night-market food stalls, and entertained\nstrangers who requested selfies with foreigners.\n\nStill, at least dozens of trainees quit before the end of training, according\nto the American employees. TSMC announced a recurring retention bonus in 2022.\nThe remaining American workers began speculating that the company only hired\nthem to secure CHIPS Act funding, Bruce said. But he stayed on: He wanted to\nsee TSMC come to life in Arizona.\n\nAn entrance to TSMC\u2019s office and parking facilities in northern Phoenix in\nMarch 2024.\n\nIn late 2022, the employees began migrating from humid southern Taiwan to the\ndesert of northern Phoenix. The group included the Americans, as well as\nhundreds of Taiwanese employees who would help install tools, manage\nsuppliers, and prepare the Arizona plant for mass production.\n\nFor the Taiwanese, many of whom planned for extended stays in Phoenix, that\nmeant relocating entire families \u2014 toddlers and dogs included \u2014 to a foreign\ncountry. Many regarded it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to explore the\nworld, practice English, and send their children to American schools. Younger\nfamilies planned pregnancies so they could give birth to American citizens.\n\u201cIf we are going to have children, of course we will have them here,\u201d a\nTaiwanese engineer told Rest of World. \u201cAs an American citizen, they will have\nmore options than others.\u201d\n\nTo cover the high living costs, TSMC provided the Taiwanese workers with\nstipend for cars and housing. Some families moved into apartment complexes\nreserved for employees, dubbed \u201cTSMC villages.\u201d Local schools introduced\nMandarin visual aids in classrooms for Taiwanese pupils. A Chinese Baptist\nchurch in Phoenix organized English-language classes, taught by earlier\ngenerations of Taiwanese immigrants, to help the newcomers settle in.\n\nSunday service at a Chinese Baptist church in Phoenix that some TSMC engineers\nattend.\n\nMany experienced a culture shock. The bustling cities of Taiwan are densely\npacked and offer extensive public transport, ubiquitous street food, and\n24-hour convenience stores every few blocks. In northern Phoenix, everyday\nlife is impossible without a car, and East Asian faces are scarce. \u201cEverything\nis so big in America,\u201d said one engineer, recalling his first impression. He\nrecounted his wife summarizing her impression of the U.S.: \u201cGreat mountains,\ngreat rivers, and great boredom.\u201d\n\nThe Taiwanese engineers brought with them the intense TSMC work culture.\nHaving spent years under the company\u2019s grueling management, they were used to\nlong days, out-of-hours calls, and harsh treatment from their managers. In\nTaiwan, the pay and prestige were worth it, they told Rest of World \u2014 despite\nthe challenges, many felt proud working for the island\u2019s most prominent firm.\nIt was the best job they could hope for.\n\nBut the American workers didn\u2019t have the same sense of loyalty. In the U.S.,\nengineers had a plethora of job options that provided competitive pay and\nabundant personal time. The Taiwanese workers described their Phoenix\ncolleagues as arrogant, carefree, and more willing to challenge orders. \u201cIt\u2019s\nhard to get them to do things,\u201d a Taiwanese engineer in Phoenix told Rest of\nWorld.\n\nBruce said that working conditions didn\u2019t improve for the Americans once they\nrelocated to Arizona. The American workers did not get more say in how the\ncompany was run, and they found the obsequiousness of their Taiwanese\ncolleagues irritating. TSMC workers were asked to draw up reports and keep\nother documents in a PowerPoint format so that they could regularly make\npresentations to upper management. The Taiwanese employees were used to it,\nwhile the Americans became impatient with typing up weekly work reports. The\nAmericans also resented that Taiwanese colleagues stayed late at the office\nfor no good reason. \u201cThat pisses me off,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cThey were just doing it\nfor show.\u201d\n\nFive former employees from the U.S. told Rest of World that TSMC engineers\nsometimes falsified or cherry-picked data for customers and managers.\nSometimes, the engineers said, staff would manipulate data from testing tools\nor wafers to please managers who had seemingly impossible expectations. Other\ntimes, one engineer said, \u201cbecause the workers were spread so thin, anything\nthey could do to get work off their plate they would do.\u201d Four American\nemployees described TSMC culture as \u201csave face\u201d: Workers would strive to make\na team, a department, or the company look good at the expense of efficiency\nand employee wellbeing.\n\nMany of TSMC\u2019s Taiwanese workers have settled into apartment complexes in the\nnorthern Phoenix suburbs. The area is difficult to navigate without a vehicle,\nwith wide multi-lane roads and strip malls.\n\nIn mid-2023, TSMC announced delays in the construction of its first facility\nin Arizona, dubbed Fab 21 \u2014 production at the facility would start in 2025\ninstead of 2024 as planned. TSMC blamed a shortage of skilled workers.\nConstruction unions, however, complained of safety hazards and questioned if\nTSMC was using this as an excuse to bring in cheap labor from Taiwan.\n\nEngineers who were supposed to run production lines were reassigned to work\nremotely for Fab 18 back in Tainan, and asked to join late-night meetings.\nSome Americans and Taiwanese engineers were reassigned to help speed up the\nbuilding of the facility, and asked to oversee construction workers. Clad in\ntheir clean-room suits and hard hats, engineers would sometimes collect trash\nat the unfinished sites. One ex-employee recalled colleagues collecting\nbottles of urine left by construction crews.\n\nJust like in Taiwan, language barriers contributed to tension in Phoenix.\nBruce said his department manager, who had come from Taiwan, spoke poor\nEnglish. So instead of communicating with Bruce directly, he\u2019d channel\nfeedback or instructions through a Taiwanese colleague. One U.S. engineer said\nmanagers trusted Taiwanese workers with important tasks, starving the\nAmericans of hands-on experience. One ex-employee later joked that the biggest\nskill he learned at TSMC was making PowerPoint slides.\n\nDisgruntled Americans flocked to post complaints to workplace review website\nGlassdoor, reporting long hours, high stress, unrealistic deadlines, and\n\u201cAsian culture.\u201d TSMC currently has a rating of 3.2 out of 5 stars on the\nsite. American chipmakers Intel and Texas Instruments, by comparison, have a\n4.1 rating. The poor Glassdoor rating made it more difficult for TSMC to hire\nexperienced American workers, a former TSMC manager told Rest of World.\nAnother former employee said he convinced six engineer friends to turn down\noffers from TSMC.\n\n> \"TSMC was the worst possible place to work on Earth.\"\n\nThe company made further attempts to adapt to American work culture. In early\n2023, TSMC held weekly English-language and cultural classes for Taiwanese\nmanagers. A former TSMC staffer who worked on the education program said\nmanagers were instructed not to yell at employees in public, or threaten to\nfire them without consulting human resources. \u201cThey would say, \u2018Okay, okay, I\nget it. I\u2019m not going to do that,\u2019\u201d the employee recalled to Rest of World.\n\u201cBut I think in the heat of the moment, they forgot, and they did do it.\u201d\n\nTaiwanese managers were reminded not to ask employees why they were taking\nsick leave, or ask female job applicants about their plans to have children \u2014\nan illegal yet common question in Taiwan. An ex-TSMC engineer said the company\nonce sent an email reminding staff that the commonly used Mandarin term \u201cnei\nge\u201d \u2014 which means \u201cthat\u201d \u2014 could sound like the N-word.\n\nIn December 2023, following months of negotiations, TSMC made a deal with\nArizona construction labor unions, agreeing to develop a workforce training\nprogram, maintain transparency on site safety, and focus on hiring locally.\n\nMeanwhile, some American engineers started seeking out opportunities at\ncompanies with less strenuous expectations and better career prospects.\nWorkers started joking that joining TSMC was a stepping stone to Intel, which\nwas also expanding in Arizona at the time. An engineer, who has worked at both\nIntel and TSMC, said Taiwanese colleagues had also asked him about vacancies\nat Intel, where they expected a better work-and-life balance.\n\nSeveral American former employees said they felt relief after quitting. In\ngroup chats, engineers celebrated the departure of their friends. \u201cTSMC was\nthe worst possible place to work on Earth,\u201d one American ex-TSMC engineer told\nRest of World. Another, who recently left the company, described TSMC as\nhaving \u201ca purely authoritarian work structure.\u201d\n\nBruce resigned in 2023. He is still friends with his Taiwanese former\ncolleagues, and kept his TSMC badge, water bottle, and TSMC T-shirt as\nmementos. He said he felt triumphant walking out. The American workers had\nvoiced their concerns in meetings with management, but he didn\u2019t see changes\nhappening. \u201cAll of us gave them every chance to listen, but they never did,\u201d\nhe told Rest of World.\n\nChain link fencing and privacy tarp surround TSMC\u2019s construction site in the\nArizona desert, as seen in March 2024.\n\nThree years after construction began, the first planned Phoenix plant is still\nincomplete. During an earnings call in April, TSMC chief executive C.C. Wei\nsaid the facility had entered \u201cengineering wafer production,\u201d meaning it\u2019s\nmaking prototype wafers to prepare for commercial operation next year. In\nJanuary, TSMC announced further delays at its second facility, too. Originally\nset to begin operations in 2026, it won\u2019t open until 2027 or 2028.\n\nChang-Tai Hsieh, an economics professor at the University of Chicago, told\nRest of World that TSMC had found the U.S. a challenging environment to\noperate in because of the complicated regulatory process, strong construction\nunions, and a workforce less used to the long hours that are commonplace at\nTSMC in Taiwan. \u201cTSMC\u2019s profits from their U.S. fabs will be lower, unless\ntheir clients are willing to pay more to source from the U.S. fabs,\u201d Hsieh\nsaid. \u201cThe only thing they need Phoenix for is to make sure that the U.S.\ngovernment doesn\u2019t turn against them.\u201d In 2023, TSMC made more than 65% of its\nrevenue from customers in the U.S. In the April earnings call, chief executive\nWei said customers needed to share the high costs of producing outside Taiwan.\n\n> \u201cThe only thing they need Phoenix for is to make sure that the U.S.\n> government doesn\u2019t turn against them.\u201d\n\nThat same month, following years of negotiations, the U.S. government\nannounced plans to award TSMC $6.6 billion in grants and about $5 billion in\nloans, with TSMC agreeing to construct a third factory on its Phoenix site\nthat will start operating by the end of the decade. (Meanwhile, Intel was\nawarded $8.5 billion in grants in March, and Samsung was provided $6.4 billion\nin direct funding in April.)\n\nDespite the flood of investments, the U.S. has a long way to go before chip\nself-reliance, experts told Rest of World. TSMC Arizona\u2019s first two facilities\nare expected to make 600,000 wafers a year \u2014 a fraction of the company\u2019s\ncurrent annual capacity of 16 million wafers. Many of the chips made in the\nU.S. still need to be shipped back to Asia for assembly, testing, and\npackaging. Chip packaging company Amkor, which has most of its factories in\nAsia, will build a plant in Arizona to package Apple chips made at TSMC.\n\nThe U.S. needs to offer timely, consistent support to companies like TSMC in\norder to create the kind of chip ecosystem that took Taiwan three decades to\nbuild, according to Jason Hsu, a former legislator in Taiwan and now a\nresearch fellow at Harvard Kennedy School with a focus on semiconductors and\ngeopolitics. It would be easier to leave the job to its Asian allies. \u201cYou\ndon\u2019t need to raise a cow to have the milk,\u201d Hsu said. \u201cYou just have to make\nsure that the milk can be delivered to your doorstep.\u201d\n\nA view overlooking the Sonoran Desert, across the highway from where TSMC is\nbuilding its Phoenix facility, as seen in March 2024. Much of the area around\nthe facility is undeveloped desert.\n\nOn February 24, 2024, TSMC inaugurated its newest factory, located in\nKumamoto, Japan, where construction had begun about a year later than in\nArizona.\n\nAt the ribbon-cutting ceremony, guests were served Taiwan\u2019s signature\npineapple cakes and greeted by the beloved bear mascot Kumamon. Thanks to\nstrong government support, local partnerships, and a low-cost labor force that\nworked 24/7, the factory had been completed at dazzling speed.\n\n\u201cWe committed to getting it ready in two years because that\u2019s what TSMC asked\nus,\u201d Kumamoto Governor Ikuo Kabashima told Bloomberg. Chang hailed the factory\nas the start of \u201ca renaissance of semiconductor manufacturing\u201d in Japan.\n\nAlthough the factory in Japan will make less-advanced chips than the American\none, the news out of Kumamoto prompted feelings of envy in Phoenix. There,\nengineers felt that they were falling even further behind.\n\nThe same weekend as the opening of the Japanese plant, Taiwanese engineers\ndiscussed the struggle of working with Americans at a gathering in Phoenix.\n\u201cThe Japan factory opened first. I\u2019m very frustrated,\u201d a Taiwanese engineer\nsaid.\n\nSitting in a room together, the engineers admitted that although they had made\nsome progress in acclimating to life in the U.S., TSMC had yet to find a\nbalance between the two work cultures. Some Taiwanese workers complained that\nmanagement was being too accommodating in giving Americans less work, paying\nthem high salaries, and letting them get off work early.\n\nAnother engineer said the company babied Americans. \u201cIf local hires are not\nready, this is our opportunity to apply for a green card,\u201d he joked.\n\nAnother engineer said he sometimes shared the Americans\u2019 frustration with the\nhierarchy, discipline, and long hours. But these things, he believed, had\nenabled TSMC to surpass its competitors to become the chip leader.\n\n\u201cEverything comes from working hard. Without this culture, TSMC cannot be\nnumber one in the world,\u201d he said with passion. \u201cI want to support TSMC to be\ngreat. It\u2019s my religion.\u201d\n\nEnjoyed this story?
