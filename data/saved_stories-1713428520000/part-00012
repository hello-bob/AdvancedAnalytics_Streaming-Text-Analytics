But Chewey knows\nthat\u2019s not the norm for most members of the Cherokee Nation.\n\nWith only about 2,000 native Cherokee speakers, many of whom are in their 70s\nor older, Cherokee, like many indigenous languages, is in danger. But members\nof the UKB, in collaboration with Northeastern University, are fighting to\nmake sure their language persists for generations to come.\n\nHoused at Northeastern, Cherokees Writing the Keetoowah Way, a potentially\nlife-changing digital resource, aims to help ensure the Cherokee language\npersists. CWKW, a product of Northeastern\u2019s Digital Archive of American Indian\nLanguages Preservation and Perseverance, brings to life historic Cherokee\ndocuments\u2013\u2013from prison letters to myths\u2013\u2013by translating them into English and\nintegrating them into Cherokee language lessons that can be used by speakers\nof any skill level.\n\nEllen Cushman, dean\u2019s professor of civic sustainability; professor of English;\nfounder and project leader of DAILP and citizen of the Cherokee Nation. Photo\nby Matthew Modoono/Northeastern University\n\nFor Ellen Cushman, dean\u2019s professor of civic sustainability and professor of\nEnglish at Northeastern, founder and project leader of DAILP and citizen of\nthe Cherokee Nation, the goal of CKWK goes beyond language preservation. She\nsays language persistence is key to the project, ensuring that Cherokee is not\njust seen and used as a connection to the past but instead has a future.\n\n\u201cHow do we read, write, speak and learn together as we\u2019re recuperating the\nlanguage and the words that haven\u2019t been spoken in generations?\u201d Cushman says.\n\u201cThe more that we\u2019re able to demonstrate that it\u2019s still useful and still\nimportant and still vibrant and something that connects you across generations\nand distances\u2013\u2013thousands of miles in our case\u2013\u2013absolutely you have whole new\nreasons and purposes to practice.\u201d\n\nBri Alexander, a research associate at DAILP who works with and is enrolled in\nthe Cherokee Nation and Shawnee Tribe, says losing language is the equivalent\nof losing your identity. Language defines how you perceive and understand\nyourself and the world. It\u2019s the reason why projects like the CWKW are so\ninvaluable.\n\n\u201cThe Cherokee language is Cherokee,\u201d Alexander says. \u201cCherokee in particular\nis very descriptive, and there\u2019s a lot more verbs than nouns. So, it\u2019s a doing\nlanguage and a descriptive language. You just relate differently to the world\nwhen you\u2019re speaking Cherokee, and that perspective really needs to carry on\nand continue.\u201d\n\n### Protecting Indigenous Languages Using Automatic Speech Recognition\n\nThe foundation of CWKW is the hard work of UKB members who saw \u201ca lack of\nhistorical documentation of our people\u201d and decided to do something about it,\nsays Ernestine Berry, a tribal member of the UKB and member of the DAILP\nadvisory board.\n\nAs director of the John Hair Cultural Center and Museum, Berry started\ncollecting and translating Cherokee manuscripts from community members into\nEnglish. The volume and diversity of documents she and her team uncovered\nsurprised her.\n\n\u201cAs we began to search, we began to find documents that were from the 1860s,\n1850s,\u201d Berry says. \u201cWe collected more than 100 years of documents for our\npeople.\u201d\n\nBerry provided about 100 translated documents to DAILP, which set about making\na site that could host and bring to life the rich history contained in them.\nCWKW currently includes 87 documents spread across four categories: funeral\nnotices, letters, stories/myths and government documents.\n\nLeft to right: John Chewey, a translator on Cherokees Writing the Kheetoowah\nWay and member of the United Kheetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians; Bri\nAlexander, research associate with DAILP who works with and is enrolled with\nboth the Cherokee Nation and Shawnee Tribe. Photos by Matthew\nModoono/Northeastern University\n\nThe documents provide insights into lives lived, like the Dollie Duncan\nletters, notes written from people in prison to their families. Meanwhile the\ncollection of myths and stories show how vital storytelling was, and is, to\nthe Cherokee. Stories like \u201cOld Man Butterfly at Standing Rock,\u201d about an\nelderly craftsman of musical instruments, and \u201cThunder and Big Snake,\u201d which\ndetails a competition between a man and a massive serpent, have been passed\ndown for generations. Speaking the words would breathe life into them,\nanimating not only the Cherokee language but the Cherokee themselves.\n\n\u201cThey would tell those stories when I was growing up,\u201d says Chewey, who served\nas a translation specialist on the project. \u201cTo see them in writing and how\nwe\u2019re able to translate them, we\u2019re almost able to see life taking place in\nthose times when they wrote those.\u201d\n\nDAILP collaborated with a team of UKB community members who served as Cherokee\ntranslators on the project. With their help, Cushman, along with several\nNortheastern students, broke down each document into a written translation of\neach individual word as well as the entire text of the documents. Most\ndocuments also have audio translations recorded by members of the UKB as well\nas a picture of the original document, depicting browned journal pages or\nletters with handwritten syllabary of the Cherokee language.\n\n> The more that we\u2019re able to demonstrate that it\u2019s still useful ... and\n> something that connects you across generations and distances ... you have\n> whole new reasons and purposes to practice.\n>\n> Ellen Cushman, dean\u2019s professor of civic sustainability; professor of\n> English; founder and project leader of DAILP and citizen of the Cherokee\n> Nation\n\nNaomi Trevino, an assistant project manager on CWKW and class of 2022\nNortheastern graduate, says the team\u2019s next step is to create tools that will\nlet community members directly edit the site to provide additional context and\ncommentary on specific document entries and translations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited to take that jump, going from having this be a project\nwhere community members are building with us and getting to a point where the\ncommunity members can run with it on their own,\u201d Trevino says.\n\nBut what sets CWKW apart from other archival projects is that it\u2019s not just a\ndigital repository for historic documents. It also includes lessons and\nexercises, based on the documents in CWKW, designed to help Cherokee\ninstructors and learners. It\u2019s the kind of tool that is invaluable for a new\ngeneration of Cherokee who are becoming more interested in learning the\nlanguage, Chewey says.\n\n### Hemp production could be a sustainable economic future for indigenous\ncommunities, but barriers remain\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this [generation] that was like, \u2018We were told speaking the language\nwouldn\u2019t mean anything, that we wouldn\u2019t have to use it. Learn the English,\nlearn the white man\u2019s ways because the Cherokee is going to be gone,\u2019\u201d Chewey\nsays. \u201cBut now some of the younger ones, they\u2019re wanting to learn. They\u2019re\nwondering, \u2018Who are we?\u2019 and \u2018What\u2019s the language?\u2019\u201d\n\nOn top of the genocide of indigenous people that has occurred throughout U.S.\nhistory, there is a long history of active attempts by the U.S. government to\nerase indigenous languages and culture. It\u2019s been effective. There are 245\nindigenous languages in the U.S., but 65 are already extinct and 75 are moving\nin that direction, according to the Administration for Native Americans.\n\nMost tribes in the U.S. are engaged in some kind of language persistence\nproject, including the Cherokee Nation. The team behind CWKW believe that the\nproject can help contribute to those efforts to reverse the centuries of\ndamage that have been dealt to the Cherokee language\u2013\u2013and other languages as\nwell. DAILP has been talking with members of the Eastern Band of Cherokee\nIndians and the Southern Cheyenne about using documents they have collected to\ncreate their own versions of CWKW.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been more hopeful about the future of our language,\u201d says Eva\nGarroutte, a citizen of the Cherokee Nation and member of DAILP\u2019s advisory\nboard.\n\nCody Mello-Klein is a Northeastern Global News reporter.
