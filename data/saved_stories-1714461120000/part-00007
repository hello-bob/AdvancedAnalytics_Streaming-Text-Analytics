The company\nbriefly hit the threshold in November 2021 and earlier this month but closed\nabove it for the first time on Friday, according to Bloomberg.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe news followed Alphabet's first-quarter earnings report on Thursday, where\nrevenue beat analysts' expectations due to the success of Google's search\nengine. Alphabet's chief executive, Sundar Pichar, also highlighted the\ncontributions of Google Cloud, which has been equipped with generative AI\nservices through Google's AI model, Gemini.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In Cloud, we have announced more than 1,000 new products and features over\nthe past 8 months. At Google Cloud Next, more than 300 customers and partners\nspoke about their generative AI successes with Google Cloud, including global\nbrands like Bayer, Cintas, Mercedes Benz, Walmart, and many more,\" Pichai told\ninvestors during the call.\n\nPichai also said that Google was well \"positioned for the next wave of AI\ninnovation and the opportunity ahead,\" and reminded investors that the company\nhas been \"AI-first\" since 2016.\n\nThe company also delighted investors by announcing that it would expand its\nstock repurchase program by $70 billion.\n\nAlphabet has weathered some tough times over the past year despite the past\nweek's success. It's contended growing pains with its AI offerings, including\npausing its image generator after it faced criticism for being too woke.\n\nStill, Alphabet is betting on AI as a key to its business growth and is ready\nto spend big to compete. Earlier this month, it announced that it would be\ndeveloping its own central processing unit called Axion to facilitate the\ntraining of complex AI models.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlphabet did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business\nInsider.\n\nOn February 28, Axel Springer, Business Insider's parent company, joined 31\nother media groups and filed a $2.3 billion suit against Google in Dutch\ncourt, alleging losses suffered due to the company's advertising practices.\n\nRead next\n\n### Watch: How to invest in AI stocks\n\nAI Google\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecommended video\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow us on:\n\n  * * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.
