As Schmidt wrote in a recent issue of Nature, \u2018We need\nanswers for why 2023 turned out to be the warmest year in possibly the past\n100,000 years. And we need them quickly.\u2019\n\nFor the best part of the past year, mean land and sea surface temperatures\nhave overshot previous records each month by up to 0.5 \u00b0C. That does not sound\nmuch but, to a climatologist like Gavin Schmidt, it is \u2018a huge margin at the\nplanetary scale.\u2019\n\nSea-surface temperature measurement bucket, formerly the property of the\nMeteorological Office Marine Branch.

Most harness statistical methods where\npast global temperatures, data about climate patterns (notably the El Ni\u00f1o\nSouthern Oscillation, see below) at the end of the previous year, and so on\nare used to predict next year\u2019s global temperature. Other groups harness\ncomplex simulations which use the observed conditions as their starting\nvalues.\n\nHowever, none of these models captured the size of the 2023 high temperature\nanomaly: scientists know what typical variability looks like but the high\ntemperatures last year fell well outside the historic precedents of climate\nfluctuations.\n\nClimate model simulations of new September global average records.

As\nthe financial sector likes to say, past performance is no guarantee of future\nresults, but the size of the anomalies is troubling. \u2019It is humbling to the\npoint of worrying whether the anomalous temperatures seen last year are a\n\u2018blip\u2019, or \u2018something systematic\u2019\u2019, he said.\n\nOne major influence on global climate is ENSO, the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern\nOscillation (ENSO), a recurring climate pattern which can either temporarily\ncool the planet, when it goes through a phase called La Ni\u00f1a, or temporarily\nwarm it, when it is in the El Ni\u00f1o phase, as the Earth was this past winter.\n\nEarly last year saw the end of a three-year period of La Ni\u00f1a, and based on\nearlier precedents when similar conditions prevailed, Schmidt and others had\nput the odds of 2023 turning out to be a record warm year at just one in five\nat the beginning of that year.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o & La Ni\u00f1a (El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation) climate pattern. Source:\nwww.climate.gov/enso.\n\nBut the 2023 temperature anomalies measured by an array of weather stations\nand satellites has not only been much larger than expected, but also appeared\nseveral months before the onset of the warming El Ni\u00f1o: last March, sea\nsurface temperatures in the North Atlantic Ocean began to shoot up. \u2018Bonkers\u2019\nwarming records were set in August and September, said Schmidt.\n\nAs the El Ni\u00f1o fades, the expectation would be that anomalies will dissipate\nfirst in the ocean and then and then elsewhere. \u2018But that [relative cooling]\ndoesn\u2019t seem to be quite happening yet,\u2019 he said, as 2024 is off to a record\nwarm start. \u2018If we\u2019re still breaking records in August, that will be that will\nbe quite ominous, right?\u2019\n\nTemperatures for each month from 1940 to 2024 from Copernicus/ECMWF ERA5.\nAnomalies plotted with respect to a 1850-1900 baseline.

Could it have\nsomething to do with the fallout from the January 2022 Hunga Tonga\u2013Hunga\nHa\u2018apai volcanic eruption in Tonga, which had both cooling effects from\naerosols and warming ones from stratospheric water vapour?\n\nOr perhaps it was the rise in the Sun\u2019s activity in the run-up to a predicted\nsolar maximum?\n\nOr was it something to do with the fallout of the 2020 regulations that made\nthe shipping industry reduce emissions of sulphur compounds? Though this makes\nthe industry cleaner, it also cuts the impact of those compounds on clouds,\nwhich have an overall cooling effect.\n\n\u2018What blows me away is how confident the people are that they know the answer\nwithout having done any work to demonstrate it,\u2019 said Schmidt, adding that,\nwhen taken together (so far), these factors explain a few hundredths of a\ndegree in warming, which falls far short of the divergence between expected\nand observed annual mean temperatures in 2023 of about 0.2 \u00b0C. \u2019Because we\ndon\u2019t have a great answer for what happened 2023 then anything is on the\ntable.\u2019\n\nThe models need more and more timely data to make sense of this anomaly, he\nsays. But if the anomaly persists the world\u2019s climate could be in uncharted\nterritory.\n\nTamsin Edwards, a professor at King\u2019s College London, who specializes in\nlooking at the uncertainties of climate predictions, said the anomalies are\n\u2018sobering\u2019 but added that she would only start to worry if they persist until\nthe end of this year. \u2018I am in the watch and wait camp: I think we\u2019ll know a\nlot more by the end of this year.\u2019\n\nTim Osborn, Professor of Climate Science & Director of Climatic Research Unit\nat the University of East Anglia added that, in terms of how far 2023 stands\nout from previous records or previous years, the anomaly is clearer in the\nglobal sea surface temperature than it is in the global land temperatures.\nAnd, of course, the oceans have much more heat capacity, and thus are the\nengines of the global climate system.\n\nA flight spare of the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR)\nInfrared and Visible Radiometer (IVR), as used on ERS-2 and Envisat satellites\nfor Earth surface temperature measurements.
