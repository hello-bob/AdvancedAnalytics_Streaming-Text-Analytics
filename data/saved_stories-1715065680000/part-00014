They are making a Holy War out of Ukraine,\na Russian Orthodox Jihad.\n\nProtestants are targeted disproportionately. American missionaries have been\ncoming to Ukraine for decades. As a result, Protestants make up about 4% of\nthe Ukrainian population. However, they comprise more than a third of the\ndocumented incidents of Russian persecution. At least 26 Christian leaders\nhave been killed for their faith.\n\nAmong Protestants, Baptists are particularly hard hit. The Ukrainian Baptist\nTheological Seminary reports the loss of some 400 Baptist congregations since\nthe beginning of the full scale Russian invasion.\n\nWhy are Protestants being persecuted? Russians associate Protestants,\nparticularly evangelicals, with the United States. The Russian Orthodox Church\nis a working arm of the Kremlin, so Russian soldiers assume that Protestants\nare agents of the American government.\n\nIn his Interview Putin stated his pro-choice position on abortion.
