Manning\n\nHarvard Staff Writer\n\nApril 26, 2024 5 min read\n\n## Seven projects awarded Star-Friedman Challenge grants\n\nSeven creative, cutting-edge projects in disciplines ranging from chemistry to\nhealth equity are winners of the 2024 Star-Friedman Challenge for Promising\nScientific Research.\n\nIn its 11th year, the Star-Friedman Challenge provides seed funding for novel\nresearch in the physical or social sciences, with an emphasis on new\ndirections that might not otherwise be supported through traditional funding\nchannels.\n\nThe program was first established in 2013 by a gift from James A. Star \u201983 and\nexpanded five years later by support from Josh Friedman \u201976, M.B.A. \u201980, J.D.\n\u201982, and Beth Friedman. This year\u2019s awardees were celebrated April 18.\n\n### Neuromodulatory effects of stabilized endogenous peptides\n\nFei Chen, Assistant Professor, Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative\nBiology; Core Faculty Member, Broad Institute\n\nSmall strings of amino acids called peptides, including insulin, oxytocin, and\nleptin, serve important functions in the body and hold promise as biologic\ndrugs. The use of peptides for therapeutic purposes has been hampered by their\nquick degradation, and many nervous-system-soluble peptides have not been well\ncharacterized due to their instability. Chen and colleagues will develop\nlibraries of stabilized peptides to characterize their cell-type activity in\nthe nervous system. Their aim is to identify stabilization strategies for more\nthan 100 bioactive peptides.\n\n### Why do we have fat-handling organelles in neurons?\n\nJeeyun Chung, Assistant Professor, Department of Molecular and Cellular\nBiology\n\nLipid droplets are organelles inside cells that store fatty acids and regulate\nmany cellular functions, but their roles in brain cells, such as neurons,\nremain unclear. Chung will elucidate the molecular characteristics,\nregulation, and functions of neuronal lipid droplets to understand how their\nmetabolism contributes to nervous system health and function. The research\nshould provide new insights into the role of lipid droplets in neurological\ndisorders.\n\n### Advancing health equity by increasing take-up of U.S. poverty alleviation\nprograms\n\nRita Hamad, Associate Professor, Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences,\nHarvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health\n\nThe Earned Income Tax Credit is the largest U.S. poverty alleviation policy\nfor families with children. It provides up to $7,400 annually for working\nfamilies as a tax refund, and it has well-established health benefits. Yet one\nin four eligible families do not claim the benefit, in part because of the\ncomplexity of tax filing. Hamad will lead a study to identify actionable and\nscalable approaches for increasing take-up of the tax credit to advance health\nequity.\n\n### Unlocking the treasure trove: Analog data for studying climate change and\nbeyond\n\nMiaki Ishii, Professor, Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences\n\nIncreasing temperatures are bringing severe weather phenomena, from floods to\nfires, which cause billions of dollars in damages each year. Ishii and\ncolleagues will use more than 150 years of historical weather observations to\ndocument how such extreme weather events have been worsening since the pre-\nindustrial era. She will lead the creation of software to efficiently convert\nanalog meteorological data to digital, and to demonstrate the significant\nvalue of historical data for climate research and more. The team will work\nwith Seikei University in Tokyo to salvage massive amounts of historical\nweather data that exists only in paper or analog form.\n\n### Transforming organ storage with porous water\n\nJarad Mason, Associate Professor, Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology\n\nKorkut Uygun, Associate Professor, Department of Surgery, Harvard Medical\nSchool; Director of Cell, Tissue, and Organ Resource Core at Massachusetts\nGeneral Hospital; Deputy Director of Research, Shriners Hospital for Children\n\nOrgan transplantation is a life-saving treatment for patients with end-stage\norgan failure. Every year, thousands of potentially transplantable organs are\nlost or rejected because they incur damage due to lack of oxygen while they\u2019re\nstored and transported to the patient. The researchers will explore\ninnovations from Mason\u2019s lab in microporous water, loaded with nanoparticles\nthat carry high densities of oxygen, that could enable longer preservation\ntimes for organs and save more lives.\n\n### Biodiversity collapse and recovery at the end of the world: Using East\nGondwana\u2019s fossil record to understand Earth\u2019s greatest mass extinction\n\nStephanie Pierce, Professor, Department of Organismic and Evolutionary\nBiology; Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology, Museum of Comparative Zoology\n\nStudying mass extinction events in the deep past can provide a unique\nperspective for understanding current and future impacts of climate change.\nPierce proposes to focus on the largest biodiversity crisis in the history of\nlife, the Permo-Triassic Mass Extinction, which occurred 252 million years ago\nand ended in 90 percent of all species vanishing. Her team will conduct\npaleontological excavations along the Bowen Basin in Australia, which is part\nof the eastern Gondwanan supercontinent, now modern Australia and New Zealand.\nHer aim is to chronicle biodiversity collapse and recovery in this relatively\npoorly studied but historically significant region, and the extent to which\ngeography may influence survival outcomes.\n\n### Bridging quantum chemistry and physics by chirality\n\nSuyang Xu, Assistant Professor, Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology\n\nJoonho Lee, Assistant Professor, Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology\n\nIn chemistry, a molecule is said to be chiral if it cannot be superimposed on\nits mirror image \u2014 much like the left hand placed on top of the right.\nChirality determines many molecules\u2019 chemical, pharmaceutical, and biochemical\nproperties, but there is currently no general strategy for driving chemical\nreactions that control for chirality. The researchers are proposing a new way\nto synthesize chiral molecules based on electronic selectivity, rather than\nstructural selectivity, as is typically used in chemical engineering. They\nwill leverage breakthroughs in quantum materials to define a precise,\nefficient process for developing molecules with specific chiral properties.\n\n#### Share this article\n\n  * Share on Facebook\n  * Share on LinkedIn\n  * Email article\n  * Print/PDF\n\n## You might like\n\n  * Science & Tech\n\n### Early warning sign of extinction?\n\nFossil record stretching millions of years shows tiny ocean creatures on the\nmove before Earth heats up\n\nPart of the Findings series\n\n3 min read\n\n  * Science & Tech\n\n### So much for summers of love\n\nDespite \u2018hippie\u2019 reputation, male bonobos fight three times as often as\nchimps, study finds\n\nPart of the Findings series\n\n3 min read\n\n  * Science & Tech\n\n### Are you a human?
