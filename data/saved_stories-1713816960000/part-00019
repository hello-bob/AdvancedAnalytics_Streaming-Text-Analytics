It tells the story of \"how his company, Digital\nResearch Inc., established CP/M as an industry standard and its subsequent\nloss to a version from Microsoft that copied the look and feel of the DRI\nsoftware.\"\n\nKildall was a CS instructor and later associate professor at the Naval\nPostgraduate School (NPS) in Monterey, California... He became fascinated with\nIntel Corporation's first microprocessor chip and simulated its operation on\nthe school's IBM mainframe computer. This work earned him a consulting\nrelationship with the company to develop PL/M, a high-level programming\nlanguage that played a significant role in establishing Intel as the dominant\nsupplier of chips for personal computers.\n\nTo design software tools for Intel's second-generation processor, he needed to\nconnect to a new 8\" floppy disk-drive storage unit from Memorex. He wrote code\nfor the necessary interface software that he called CP/M (Control Program for\nMicrocomputers) in a few weeks, but his efforts to build the electronic\nhardware required to transfer the data failed. The project languished for a\nyear. Frustrated, he called electronic engineer John Torode, a college friend\nthen teaching at UC Berkeley, who crafted a \"beautiful rat's nest of\nwirewraps, boards and cables\" for the task.\n\nLate one afternoon in the fall of 1974, together with John Torode, in the\nbackyard workshop of his home at 781 Bayview Avenue, Pacific Grove, Gary\n\"loaded my CP/M program from paper tape to the diskette and 'booted' CP/M from\nthe diskette, and up came the prompt: *\n\n[...] By successfully booting a computer from a floppy disk drive, they had\ngiven birth to an operating system that, together with the microprocessor and\nthe disk drive, would provide one of the key building blocks of the personal\ncomputer revolution... As Intel expressed no interest in CP/M, Gary was free\nto exploit the program on his own and sold the first license in 1975. What\nhappened next? Here's some highlights from the blog post:\n\n  * \"Reluctant to adapt the code for another controller, Gary worked with Glen Ewing to split out the hardware dependent-portions so they could be incorporated into a separate piece of code called the BIOS (Basic Input Output System)... The BIOS code allowed all Intel and compatible microprocessor-based computers from other manufacturers to run CP/M on any new hardware. This capability stimulated the rise of an independent software industry...\"\n\n  * \"CP/M became accepted as a standard and was offered by most early personal computer vendors, including pioneers Altair, Amstrad, Kaypro, and Osborne...\"\n\n  * \"[Gary's company] introduced operating systems with windowing capability and menu-driven user interfaces years before Apple and Microsoft... However, by the mid-1980s, in the struggle with the juggernaut created by the combined efforts of IBM and Microsoft, DRI had lost the basis of its operating systems business.\"\n\n  * \"Gary sold the company to Novell Inc. of Provo, Utah, in 1991. Ultimately, Novell closed the California operation and, in 1996, disposed of the assets to Caldera, Inc., which used DRI intellectual property assets to prevail in a lawsuit against Microsoft.\"\n\n### \u2190\n\n### Related Links\n\n### \u2192\n\nWhat Happened After Amazon Electrified Its Delivery Fleet?\n\n### The Legendary Zilog Z80 CPU Is Being Discontinued After Nearly 50 Years\n\nThis is the most recent story.

IBM took the least of these and released a PC. It wasn't much,\nbut it had the name IBM on the side so a lot of people bought.
