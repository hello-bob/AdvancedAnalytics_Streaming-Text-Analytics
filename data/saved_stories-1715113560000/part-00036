This\ninvite-only event in SF will explore the intersection of technology and\nbusiness. Find out how you can attend here.\n\nEspresso AI, a stealthy Silicon Valley artificial intelligence startup, has\nraised over $11 million in seed funding to bring the power of AI to perhaps\nthe biggest challenge in enterprise computing today: reining in runaway cloud\ncosts. The funding includes a seed round led by Daniel Gross and Nat Friedman,\nand a pre-seed round led by Matt Turck at FirstMark, with participation from\nindustry leaders.\n\nThe company, which emerged from stealth today, has developed technology that\nuses advanced language models and machine learning to automatically optimize\ncode and reduce cloud compute costs by up to 80%. Its initial product focuses\non streamlining SQL queries for Snowflake, the popular cloud data warehousing\nplatform.\n\n\u201cThe opportunity is just enormous,\u201d Espresso AI founder and CEO Ben Lerner\nsaid in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \u201cSnowflake alone has $2\nbillion in annual revenue. If you look across data warehousing broadly, it\u2019s\ncertainly hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for us, and billions in\npotential savings for customers.\u201d\n\n## A brewing crisis in cloud costs\n\nThe move to the cloud has been a double-edged sword for enterprises. While\ncloud platforms provide unparalleled flexibility and scalability, they have\nalso introduced new challenges around cost control and visibility. Many\norganizations now find themselves grappling with unexpectedly high bills and\nstruggling to forecast and manage their spend.\n\n### VB Event\n\nThe AI Impact Tour \u2013 San Francisco\n\nJoin us as we navigate the complexities of responsibly integrating AI in\nbusiness at the next stop of VB\u2019s AI Impact Tour in San Francisco. Don\u2019t miss\nout on the chance to gain insights from industry experts, network with like-\nminded innovators, and explore the future of GenAI with customer experiences\nand optimize business processes.\n\nRequest an invite\n\nData warehousing is a particular pain point. As companies consolidate data\nsilos and launch new analytics and machine learning initiatives, data\nwarehouses have become some of the biggest consumers of cloud resources. But\noptimizing these workloads for cost and performance is notoriously difficult.\n\n\u201cWhat we hear all the time from users is that Snowflake is their second\nbiggest line item after AWS,\u201d Lerner told VentureBeat. \u201cAnd if you go to any\nSnowflake event, they really focus on two things: cost and performance.\u201d\n\n## AI to the rescue\n\nEspresso AI\u2019s solution is to harness the power of large language models\n(LLMs), the foundational technology behind viral sensations like ChatGPT, to\ntackle the problem of code optimization. By training these models to deeply\nunderstand SQL queries and database architectures, Espresso AI has built a\nplatform that can automatically refactor queries to make them more efficient.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: Espresso AI plugs into a company\u2019s existing Snowflake\nsetup and continuously analyzes the queries being run against the data\nwarehouse. Using a combination of natural language processing, program\nsynthesis, and reinforcement learning, it identifies opportunities for\noptimization and rewrites queries on the fly to improve performance and\nminimize compute usage.\n\n\u201cThe reason this is so powerful is that for a lot of existing applications,\nyou need to have a human in the loop to check for accuracy,\u201d Lerner explained.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re optimizing code, you already know what you want it to do \u2013 just\ngo faster. And so we can automatically verify the optimized code is correct.\u201d\n\nSetup is designed to be simple, with the ability to get up and running in\nunder 10 minutes by just changing a single connection string. \u201cIt\u2019s as easy as\nchanging a URL,\u201d said Lerner. \u201cYou point your BI and analytics tools to the\nEspresso endpoint instead of directly to Snowflake, and we handle the rest.\u201d\n\n## Poised for growth\n\nEspresso AI has already seen strong early traction, with multiple enterprise\ncustomers using its platform to optimize production Snowflake workloads. The\ncompany plans to use its funding to accelerate product development and go-to-\nmarket efforts.\n\nWhile Snowflake is the initial focus, Espresso AI\u2019s technology is extensible\nto any SQL data warehouse. Support for platforms like Databricks is on the\nnear-term roadmap. Longer-term, the company envisions using its AI\noptimization engine to speed up compute across the stack, from data pre-\nprocessing to model training.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to put a dollar amount on what the world will look like if\ncomputers run 100 times faster,\u201d said Mr. Lerner. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to go\nfast. We\u2019ll be able to do more research, more machine learning. There are tons\nof constraints around compute today.\u201d\n\nOf course, delivering 100x speedups is easier said than done. While Espresso\nAI has shown impressive results in early customer deployments, achieving\norder-of-magnitude performance gains will require significant research\nbreakthroughs. The company will also need to fend off competition from cloud\nproviders themselves, who are heavily investing in cost management and\noptimization capabilities.\n\nBut if Espresso AI can deliver on even a fraction of its founding vision, the\nimplications could be profound. With enterprises spending over $600 billion\nannually on cloud and on-prem compute, the market opportunity for AI-powered\nefficiency gains is massive.\n\nIn an era of belt-tightening and digital transformation, technologies that can\ndrive meaningful cost savings without sacrificing performance will find an\neager audience among CIOs. By bringing the power of AI to the unsexy but\nessential domain of code optimization, Espresso AI may be brewing up something\ntruly disruptive.\n\nIf a cup of coffee is the price to pay for taming cloud costs, expect a lot\nmore IT leaders to line up for a sip of Espresso AI.\n\nVB Daily\n\nStay in the know!
