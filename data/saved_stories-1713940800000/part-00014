The way you approach IT investment and management\nwill need to change dramatically.\n\nby\n\n  * Nicholas G. Carr\n\nby\n\n  * Nicholas G.

If so, you\u2019re not alone. Businesses\nworldwide pump $2 trillion a year into IT. But like many broadly adopted\ntechnologies\u2014such as railways and electrical power\u2014IT has become a commodity.\nAffordable and accessible to everyone, it no longer offers strategic value to\nanyone.\n\nScarcity\u2014not ubiquity\u2014makes a business resource truly strategic. Companies\ngain an edge by having or doing something others can\u2019t have or do. In IT\u2019s\nearlier days, forward-looking firms trumped competitors through innovative\ndeployment of IT; for example, Federal Express\u2019s package-tracking system and\nAmerican Airlines\u2019 Sabre reservation system.\n\nNow that IT is ubiquitous, however, we must focus on its risks more than its\npotential strategic advantages. Consider electricity. No company builds its\nstrategy on its electrical usage\u2014but even a brief lapse in supply can be\ndevastating. Today, an IT disruption can prove equally paralyzing to your\ncompany\u2019s ability to make products, deliver services, and satisfy customers.\n\nBut the greatest IT risk is overspending\u2014putting your company at a cost\ndisadvantage. The lesson? Make IT management boring. Instead of aggressively\nseeking an edge through IT, manage IT\u2019s costs and risks with a frugal hand and\npragmatic eye\u2014despite any renewed hype about its strategic value. Worrying\nabout what might go wrong isn\u2019t glamorous, but it\u2019s smart business now.\n\nThe Idea in Practice\n\nTo avoid overinvesting in IT:\n\n## Spend Less.\n\nRigorously evaluate expected returns from IT investments. Separate essential\ninvestments from discretionary, unnecessary, or counterproductive ones.\nExplore simpler and cheaper alternatives, and eliminate waste. Example:\n\nBusinesses buy 100 million+ PCs annually\u2014yet most workers use PCs for simple\napplications that require a fraction of their computing power. Start imposing\nhard limits on upgrade costs\u2014rather than buying new computers and applications\nevery time suppliers roll out new features. Negotiate contracts ensuring long-\nterm usefulness of your PC investments. If vendors balk, explore cheaper\nsolutions, including bare-bones network PCs.\n\nAlso assess your data storage, which accounts for 50%+ of many companies\u2019 IT\nexpenditures\u2014even though most saved data consists of employees\u2019 e-mails and\nfiles that have little relevance to making products or serving customers.\n\n## Follow, Don\u2019t Lead.\n\nDelay IT investments to significantly cut costs and decrease your risk of\nbuying flawed or soon-to-be obsolete equipment or applications. Today, smart\nIT users hang back from the cutting edge, buying only after standards and best\npractices solidify. They let more impatient rivals shoulder the high costs of\nexperimentation. Then they sweep past them, paying less while getting more.\n\n## Focus on Risks, not Opportunities.\n\nMany corporations are ceding control over their IT applications and networks\nto vendors and other third parties. The consequences of moving from tightly\ncontrolled, proprietary systems to open, shared ones? More and more threats in\nthe form of technical glitches, service outages, and security breaches. Focus\nIT resources on preparing for such disruptions\u2014not deploying IT in radical new\nways.\n\nIn 1968, a young Intel engineer named Ted Hoff found a way to put the circuits\nnecessary for computer processing onto a tiny piece of silicon. His invention\nof the microprocessor spurred a series of technological breakthroughs\u2014desktop\ncomputers, local and wide area networks, enterprise software, and the\nInternet\u2014that have transformed the business world. Today, no one would dispute\nthat information technology has become the backbone of commerce. It underpins\nthe operations of individual companies, ties together far-flung supply chains,\nand, increasingly, links businesses to the customers they serve. Hardly a\ndollar or a euro changes hands anymore without the aid of computer systems.\n\nAs IT\u2019s power and presence have expanded, companies have come to view it as a\nresource ever more critical to their success, a fact clearly reflected in\ntheir spending habits. In 1965, according to a study by the U.S. Department of\nCommerce\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis, less than 5% of the capital\nexpenditures of American companies went to information technology. After the\nintroduction of the personal computer in the early 1980s, that percentage rose\nto 15%. By the early 1990s, it had reached more than 30%, and by the end of\nthe decade it had hit nearly 50%. Even with the recent sluggishness in\ntechnology spending, businesses around the world continue to spend well over\n$2 trillion a year on IT.\n\nBut the veneration of IT goes much deeper than dollars. It is evident as well\nin the shifting attitudes of top managers. Twenty years ago, most executives\nlooked down on computers as proletarian tools\u2014glorified typewriters and\ncalculators\u2014best relegated to low level employees like secretaries, analysts,\nand technicians. It was the rare executive who would let his fingers touch a\nkeyboard, much less incorporate information technology into his strategic\nthinking. Today, that has changed completely. Chief executives now routinely\ntalk about the strategic value of information technology, about how they can\nuse IT to gain a competitive edge, about the \u201cdigitization\u201d of their business\nmodels. Most have appointed chief information officers to their senior\nmanagement teams, and many have hired strategy consulting firms to provide\nfresh ideas on how to leverage their IT investments for differentiation and\nadvantage.\n\nBehind the change in thinking lies a simple assumption: that as IT\u2019s potency\nand ubiquity have increased, so too has its strategic value. It\u2019s a reasonable\nassumption, even an intuitive one. But it\u2019s mistaken. What makes a resource\ntruly strategic\u2014what gives it the capacity to be the basis for a sustained\ncompetitive advantage\u2014is not ubiquity but scarcity. You only gain an edge over\nrivals by having or doing something that they can\u2019t have or do. By now, the\ncore functions of IT\u2014data storage, data processing, and data transport\u2014have\nbecome available and affordable to all.^1 Their very power and presence have\nbegun to transform them from potentially strategic resources into commodity\nfactors of production. They are becoming costs of doing business that must be\npaid by all but provide distinction to none.\n\nIT is best seen as the latest in a series of broadly adopted technologies that\nhave reshaped industry over the past two centuries\u2014from the steam engine and\nthe railroad to the telegraph and the telephone to the electric generator and\nthe internal combustion engine. For a brief period, as they were being built\ninto the infrastructure of commerce, all these technologies opened\nopportunities for forward-looking companies to gain real advantages. But as\ntheir availability increased and their cost decreased\u2014as they became\nubiquitous\u2014they became commodity inputs. From a strategic standpoint, they\nbecame invisible; they no longer mattered. That is exactly what is happening\nto information technology today, and the implications for corporate IT\nmanagement are profound.\n\n## Vanishing Advantage\n\nMany commentators have drawn parallels between the expansion of IT,\nparticularly the Internet, and the rollouts of earlier technologies. Most of\nthe comparisons, though, have focused on either the investment pattern\nassociated with the technologies\u2014the boom-to-bust cycle\u2014or the technologies\u2019\nroles in reshaping the operations of entire industries or even economies.\nLittle has been said about the way the technologies influence, or fail to\ninfluence, competition at the firm level. Yet it is here that history offers\nsome of its most important lessons to managers.\n\nA distinction needs to be made between proprietary technologies and what might\nbe called infrastructural technologies. Proprietary technologies can be owned,\nactually or effectively, by a single company. A pharmaceutical firm, for\nexample, may hold a patent on a particular compound that serves as the basis\nfor a family of drugs. An industrial manufacturer may discover an innovative\nway to employ a process technology that competitors find hard to replicate. A\ncompany that produces consumer goods may acquire exclusive rights to a new\npackaging material that gives its product a longer shelf life than competing\nbrands. As long as they remain protected, proprietary technologies can be the\nfoundations for long-term strategic advantages, enabling companies to reap\nhigher profits than their rivals.\n\nInfrastructural technologies, in contrast, offer far more value when shared\nthan when used in isolation. Imagine yourself in the early nineteenth century,\nand suppose that one manufacturing company held the rights to all the\ntechnology required to create a railroad. If it wanted to, that company could\njust build proprietary lines between its suppliers, its factories, and its\ndistributors and run its own locomotives and railcars on the tracks. And it\nmight well operate more efficiently as a result. But, for the broader economy,\nthe value produced by such an arrangement would be trivial compared with the\nvalue that would be produced by building an open rail network connecting many\ncompanies and many buyers. The characteristics and economics of\ninfrastructural technologies, whether railroads or telegraph lines or power\ngenerators, make it inevitable that they will be broadly shared\u2014that they will\nbecome part of the general business infrastructure.\n\nIn the earliest phases of its buildout, however, an infrastructural technology\ncan take the form of a proprietary technology. As long as access to the\ntechnology is restricted\u2014through physical limitations, intellectual property\nrights, high costs, or a lack of standards\u2014a company can use it to gain\nadvantages over rivals. Consider the period between the construction of the\nfirst electric power stations, around 1880, and the wiring of the electric\ngrid early in the twentieth century. Electricity remained a scarce resource\nduring this time, and those manufacturers able to tap into it\u2014by, for example,\nbuilding their plants near generating stations\u2014often gained an important edge.\nIt was no coincidence that the largest U.S. manufacturer of nuts and bolts at\nthe turn of the century, Plumb, Burdict, and Barnard, located its factory near\nNiagara Falls in New York, the site of one of the earliest large-scale\nhydroelectric power plants.\n\nCompanies can also steal a march on their competitors by having superior\ninsight into the use of a new technology. The introduction of electric power\nagain provides a good example. Until the end of the nineteenth century, most\nmanufacturers relied on water pressure or steam to operate their machinery.\nPower in those days came from a single, fixed source\u2014a waterwheel at the side\nof a mill, for instance\u2014and required an elaborate system of pulleys and gears\nto distribute it to individual workstations throughout the plant. When\nelectric generators first became available, many manufacturers simply adopted\nthem as a replacement single-point source, using them to power the existing\nsystem of pulleys and gears. Smart manufacturers, however, saw that one of the\ngreat advantages of electric power is that it is easily distributable\u2014that it\ncan be brought directly to workstations. By wiring their plants and installing\nelectric motors in their machines, they were able to dispense with the\ncumbersome, inflexible, and costly gearing systems, gaining an important\nefficiency advantage over their slower-moving competitors.\n\nIn addition to enabling new, more efficient operating methods, infrastructural\ntechnologies often lead to broader market changes. Here, too, a company that\nsees what\u2019s coming can gain a step on myopic rivals. In the mid-1800s, when\nAmerica started to lay down rail lines in earnest, it was already possible to\ntransport goods over long distances\u2014hundreds of steamships plied the country\u2019s\nrivers. Businessmen probably assumed that rail transport would essentially\nfollow the steamship model, with some incremental enhancements. In fact, the\ngreater speed, capacity, and reach of the railroads fundamentally changed the\nstructure of American industry. It suddenly became economical to ship finished\nproducts, rather than just raw materials and industrial components, over great\ndistances, and the mass consumer market came into being. Companies that were\nquick to recognize the broader opportunity rushed to build large-scale, mass-\nproduction factories. The resulting economies of scale allowed them to crush\nthe small, local plants that until then had dominated manufacturing.\n\nThe trap that executives often fall into, however, is assuming that\nopportunities for advantage will be available indefinitely. In actuality, the\nwindow for gaining advantage from an infrastructural technology is open only\nbriefly. When the technology\u2019s commercial potential begins to be broadly\nappreciated, huge amounts of cash are inevitably invested in it, and its\nbuildout proceeds with extreme speed. Railroad tracks, telegraph wires, power\nlines\u2014all were laid or strung in a frenzy of activity (a frenzy so intense in\nthe case of rail lines that it cost hundreds of laborers their lives). In the\n30 years between 1846 and 1876, reports Eric Hobsbawm in The Age of Capital,\nthe world\u2019s total rail trackage increased from 17,424 kilometers to 309,641\nkilometers. During this same period, total steamship tonnage also exploded,\nfrom 139,973 to 3,293,072 tons. The telegraph system spread even more swiftly.\nIn Continental Europe, there were just 2,000 miles of telegraph wires in 1849;\n20 years later, there were 110,000. The pattern continued with electrical\npower. The number of central stations operated by utilities grew from 468 in\n1889 to 4,364 in 1917, and the average capacity of each increased more than\ntenfold. (For a discussion of the dangers of overinvestment, see the sidebar\n\u201cToo Much of a Good Thing.\u201d)\n\n#### Too Much of a Good Thing\n\nAs many experts have pointed out, the overinvestment in information technology\nin the 1990s echoes the ...\n\nBy the end of the buildout phase, the opportunities for individual advantage\nare largely gone. The rush to invest leads to more competition, greater\ncapacity, and falling prices, making the technology broadly accessible and\naffordable. At the same time, the buildout forces users to adopt universal\ntechnical standards, rendering proprietary systems obsolete. Even the way the\ntechnology is used begins to become standardized, as best practices come to be\nwidely understood and emulated. Often, in fact, the best practices end up\nbeing built into the infrastructure itself; after electrification, for\nexample, all new factories were constructed with many well-distributed power\noutlets. Both the technology and its modes of use become, in effect,\ncommoditized. The only meaningful advantage most companies can hope to gain\nfrom an infrastructural technology after its buildout is a cost advantage\u2014and\neven that tends to be very hard to sustain.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that infrastructural technologies don\u2019t continue to\ninfluence competition. They do, but their influence is felt at the\nmacroeconomic level, not at the level of the individual company. If a\nparticular country, for instance, lags in installing the technology\u2014whether\nit\u2019s a national rail network, a power grid, or a communication\ninfrastructure\u2014its domestic industries will suffer heavily. Similarly, if an\nindustry lags in harnessing the power of the technology, it will be vulnerable\nto displacement. As always, a company\u2019s fate is tied to broader forces\naffecting its region and its industry. The point is, however, that the\ntechnology\u2019s potential for differentiating one company from the pack\u2014its\nstrategic potential\u2014inexorably declines as it becomes accessible and\naffordable to all.\n\n## The Commoditization of IT\n\nAlthough more complex and malleable than its predecessors, IT has all the\nhallmarks of an infrastructural technology. In fact, its mix of\ncharacteristics guarantees particularly rapid commoditization. IT is, first of\nall, a transport mechanism\u2014it carries digital information just as railroads\ncarry goods and power grids carry electricity. And like any transport\nmechanism, it is far more valuable when shared than when used in isolation.\nThe history of IT in business has been a history of increased\ninterconnectivity and interoperability, from mainframe time-sharing to\nminicomputer-based local area networks to broader Ethernet networks and on to\nthe Internet. Each stage in that progression has involved greater\nstandardization of the technology and, at least recently, greater\nhomogenization of its functionality. For most business applications today, the\nbenefits of customization would be overwhelmed by the costs of isolation.\n\nIT is also highly replicable. Indeed, it is hard to imagine a more perfect\ncommodity than a byte of data\u2014endlessly and perfectly reproducible at\nvirtually no cost. The near-infinite scalability of many IT functions, when\ncombined with technical standardization, dooms most proprietary applications\nto economic obsolescence. Why write your own application for word processing\nor e-mail or, for that matter, supply-chain management when you can buy a\nready-made, state-of-the-art application for a fraction of the cost? But it\u2019s\nnot just the software that is replicable. Because most business activities and\nprocesses have come to be embedded in software, they become replicable, too.\nWhen companies buy a generic application, they buy a generic process as well.\nBoth the cost savings and the interoperability benefits make the sacrifice of\ndistinctiveness unavoidable.\n\nThe arrival of the Internet has accelerated the commoditization of IT by\nproviding a perfect delivery channel for generic applications. More and more,\ncompanies will fulfill their IT requirements simply by purchasing fee-based\n\u201cWeb services\u201d from third parties\u2014similar to the way they currently buy\nelectric power or telecommunications services. Most of the major business-\ntechnology vendors, from Microsoft to IBM, are trying to position themselves\nas IT utilities, companies that will control the provision of a diverse range\nof business applications over what is now called, tellingly, \u201cthe grid.\u201d\nAgain, the upshot is ever greater homogenization of IT capabilities, as more\ncompanies replace customized applications with generic ones. (For more on the\nchallenges facing IT companies, see the sidebar \u201cWhat About the Vendors?\u201d)\n\n#### What About the Vendors?\n\nJust a few months ago, at the 2003 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland,\nBill Joy, the chief scientist and ...\n\nFinally, and for all the reasons already discussed, IT is subject to rapid\nprice deflation. When Gordon Moore made his famously prescient assertion that\nthe density of circuits on a computer chip would double every two years, he\nwas making a prediction about the coming explosion in processing power. But he\nwas also making a prediction about the coming free fall in the price of\ncomputer functionality. The cost of processing power has dropped relentlessly,\nfrom $480 per million instructions per second (MIPS) in 1978 to $50 per MIPS\nin 1985 to $4 per MIPS in 1995, a trend that continues unabated. Similar\ndeclines have occurred in the cost of data storage and transmission. The\nrapidly increasing affordability of IT functionality has not only democratized\nthe computer revolution, it has destroyed one of the most important potential\nbarriers to competitors. Even the most cutting-edge IT capabilities quickly\nbecome available to all.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise, given these characteristics, that IT\u2019s evolution has closely\nmirrored that of earlier infrastructural technologies. Its buildout has been\nevery bit as breathtaking as that of the railroads (albeit with considerably\nfewer fatalities). Consider some statistics. During the last quarter of the\ntwentieth century, the computational power of a microprocessor increased by a\nfactor of 66,000. In the dozen years from 1989 to 2001, the number of host\ncomputers connected to the Internet grew from 80,000 to more than 125 million.\nOver the last ten years, the number of sites on the World Wide Web has grown\nfrom zero to nearly 40 million. And since the 1980s, more than 280 million\nmiles of fiber-optic cable have been installed\u2014enough, as BusinessWeek\nrecently noted, to \u201ccircle the earth 11,320 times.\u201d (See the exhibit \u201cThe\nSprint to Commoditization.\u201d)\n\nThe Sprint to Commoditization\n\nAs with earlier infrastructural technologies, IT provided forward-looking\ncompanies many opportunities for competitive advantage early in its buildout,\nwhen it could still be \u201cowned\u201d like a proprietary technology. A classic\nexample is American Hospital Supply. A leading distributor of medical\nsupplies, AHS introduced in 1976 an innovative system called Analytic Systems\nAutomated Purchasing, or ASAP, that enabled hospitals to order goods\nelectronically. Developed in-house, the innovative system used proprietary\nsoftware running on a mainframe computer, and hospital purchasing agents\naccessed it through terminals at their sites. Because more efficient ordering\nenabled hospitals to reduce their inventories\u2014and thus their costs\u2014customers\nwere quick to embrace the system. And because it was proprietary to AHS, it\neffectively locked out competitors. For several years, in fact, AHS was the\nonly distributor offering electronic ordering, a competitive advantage that\nled to years of superior financial results. From 1978 to 1983, AHS\u2019s sales and\nprofits rose at annual rates of 13% and 18%, respectively\u2014well above industry\naverages.\n\nAHS gained a true competitive advantage by capitalizing on characteristics of\ninfrastructural technologies that are common in the early stages of their\nbuildouts, in particular their high cost and lack of standardization. Within a\ndecade, however, those barriers to competition were crumbling. The arrival of\npersonal computers and packaged software, together with the emergence of\nnetworking standards, was rendering proprietary communication systems\nunattractive to their users and uneconomical to their owners. Indeed, in an\nironic, if predictable, twist, the closed nature and outdated technology of\nAHS\u2019s system turned it from an asset to a liability. By the dawn of the 1990s,\nafter AHS had merged with Baxter Travenol to form Baxter International, the\ncompany\u2019s senior executives had come to view ASAP as \u201ca millstone around their\nnecks,\u201d according to a Harvard Business School case study.\n\nMyriad other companies have gained important advantages through the innovative\ndeployment of IT. Some, like American Airlines with its Sabre reservation\nsystem, Federal Express with its package-tracking system, and Mobil Oil with\nits automated Speedpass payment system, used IT to gain particular operating\nor marketing advantages\u2014to leapfrog the competition in one process or\nactivity. Others, like Reuters with its 1970s financial information network\nor, more recently, eBay with its Internet auctions, had superior insight into\nthe way IT would fundamentally change an industry and were able to stake out\ncommanding positions. In a few cases, the dominance companies gained through\nIT innovation conferred additional advantages, such as scale economies and\nbrand recognition, that have proved more durable than the original\ntechnological edge. Wal-Mart and Dell Computer are renowned examples of firms\nthat have been able to turn temporary technological advantages into enduring\npositioning advantages.\n\nBut the opportunities for gaining IT-based advantages are already dwindling.\nBest practices are now quickly built into software or otherwise replicated.\nAnd as for IT-spurred industry transformations, most of the ones that are\ngoing to happen have likely already happened or are in the process of\nhappening. Industries and markets will continue to evolve, of course, and some\nwill undergo fundamental changes\u2014the future of the music business, for\nexample, continues to be in doubt. But history shows that the power of an\ninfrastructural technology to transform industries always diminishes as its\nbuildout nears completion.\n\nWhile no one can say precisely when the buildout of an infrastructural\ntechnology has concluded, there are many signs that the IT buildout is much\ncloser to its end than its beginning. First, IT\u2019s power is outstripping most\nof the business needs it fulfills. Second, the price of essential IT\nfunctionality has dropped to the point where it is more or less affordable to\nall. Third, the capacity of the universal distribution network (the Internet)\nhas caught up with demand\u2014indeed, we already have considerably more fiber-\noptic capacity than we need. Fourth, IT vendors are rushing to position\nthemselves as commodity suppliers or even as utilities. Finally, and most\ndefinitively, the investment bubble has burst, which historically has been a\nclear indication that an infrastructural technology is reaching the end of its\nbuildout. A few companies may still be able to wrest advantages from highly\nspecialized applications that don\u2019t offer strong economic incentives for\nreplication, but those firms will be the exceptions that prove the rule.\n\nAt the close of the 1990s, when Internet hype was at full boil, technologists\noffered grand visions of an emerging \u201cdigital future.\u201d It may well be that, in\nterms of business strategy at least, the future has already arrived.\n\n## From Offense to Defense\n\nSo what should companies do? From a practical standpoint, the most important\nlesson to be learned from earlier infrastructural technologies may be this:\nWhen a resource becomes essential to competition but inconsequential to\nstrategy, the risks it creates become more important than the advantages it\nprovides. Think of electricity. Today, no company builds its business strategy\naround its electricity usage, but even a brief lapse in supply can be\ndevastating (as some California businesses discovered during the energy crisis\nof 2000). The operational risks associated with IT are many\u2014technical\nglitches, obsolescence, service outages, unreliable vendors or partners,\nsecurity breaches, even terrorism\u2014and some have become magnified as companies\nhave moved from tightly controlled, proprietary systems to open, shared ones.\nToday, an IT disruption can paralyze a company\u2019s ability to make its products,\ndeliver its services, and connect with its customers, not to mention foul its\nreputation. Yet few companies have done a thorough job of identifying and\ntempering their vulnerabilities. Worrying about what might go wrong may not be\nas glamorous a job as speculating about the future, but it is a more essential\njob right now. (See the sidebar \u201cNew Rules for IT Management.\u201d)\n\n#### New Rules for IT Management\n\nWith the opportunities for gaining strategic advantage from information\ntechnology rapidly disappearing, many ...\n\nIn the long run, though, the greatest IT risk facing most companies is more\nprosaic than a catastrophe. It is, simply, overspending. IT may be a\ncommodity, and its costs may fall rapidly enough to ensure that any new\ncapabilities are quickly shared, but the very fact that it is entwined with so\nmany business functions means that it will continue to consume a large portion\nof corporate spending. For most companies, just staying in business will\nrequire big outlays for IT. What\u2019s important\u2014and this holds true for any\ncommodity input\u2014is to be able to separate essential investments from ones that\nare discretionary, unnecessary, or even counterproductive.\n\nWhen a resource becomes essential to competition but inconsequential to\nstrategy, the risks it creates become more important than the advantages it\nprovides.\n\nAt a high level, stronger cost management requires more rigor in evaluating\nexpected returns from systems investments, more creativity in exploring\nsimpler and cheaper alternatives, and a greater openness to outsourcing and\nother partnerships. But most companies can also reap significant savings by\nsimply cutting out waste. Personal computers are a good example. Every year,\nbusinesses purchase more than 100 million PCs, most of which replace older\nmodels. Yet the vast majority of workers who use PCs rely on only a few simple\napplications\u2014word processing, spreadsheets, e-mail, and Web browsing. These\napplications have been technologically mature for years; they require only a\nfraction of the computing power provided by today\u2019s microprocessors.\nNevertheless, companies continue to roll out across-the-board hardware and\nsoftware upgrades.\n\nMuch of that spending, if truth be told, is driven by vendors\u2019 strategies. Big\nhardware and software suppliers have become very good at parceling out new\nfeatures and capabilities in ways that force companies into buying new\ncomputers, applications, and networking equipment much more frequently than\nthey need to. The time has come for IT buyers to throw their weight around, to\nnegotiate contracts that ensure the long-term usefulness of their PC\ninvestments and impose hard limits on upgrade costs. And if vendors balk,\ncompanies should be willing to explore cheaper solutions, including open-\nsource applications and bare-bones network PCs, even if it means sacrificing\nfeatures. If a company needs evidence of the kind of money that might be\nsaved, it need only look at Microsoft\u2019s profit margin.\n\nIn addition to being passive in their purchasing, companies have been sloppy\nin their use of IT. That\u2019s particularly true with data storage, which has come\nto account for more than half of many companies\u2019 IT expenditures. The bulk of\nwhat\u2019s being stored on corporate networks has little to do with making\nproducts or serving customers\u2014it consists of employees\u2019 saved e-mails and\nfiles, including terabytes of spam, MP3s, and video clips. Computerworld\nestimates that as much as 70% of the storage capacity of a typical Windows\nnetwork is wasted\u2014an enormous unnecessary expense. Restricting employees\u2019\nability to save files indiscriminately and indefinitely may seem distasteful\nto many managers, but it can have a real impact on the bottom line. Now that\nIT has become the dominant capital expense for most businesses, there\u2019s no\nexcuse for waste and sloppiness.\n\nGiven the rapid pace of technology\u2019s advance, delaying IT investments can be\nanother powerful way to cut costs\u2014while also reducing a firm\u2019s chance of being\nsaddled with buggy or soon-to-be-obsolete technology. Many companies,\nparticularly during the 1990s, rushed their IT investments either because they\nhoped to capture a first-mover advantage or because they feared being left\nbehind. Except in very rare cases, both the hope and the fear were\nunwarranted. The smartest users of technology\u2014here again, Dell and Wal-Mart\nstand out\u2014stay well back from the cutting edge, waiting to make purchases\nuntil standards and best practices solidify. They let their impatient\ncompetitors shoulder the high costs of experimentation, and then they sweep\npast them, spending less and getting more.\n\nSome managers may worry that being stingy with IT dollars will damage their\ncompetitive positions. But studies of corporate IT spending consistently show\nthat greater expenditures rarely translate into superior financial results. In\nfact, the opposite is usually true. In 2002, the consulting firm Alinean\ncompared the IT expenditures and the financial results of 7,500 large U.S.\ncompanies and discovered that the top performers tended to be among the most\ntightfisted. The 25 companies that delivered the highest economic returns, for\nexample, spent on average just 0.8% of their revenues on IT, while the typical\ncompany spent 3.7%. A recent study by Forrester Research showed, similarly,\nthat the most lavish spenders on IT rarely post the best results. Even\nOracle\u2019s Larry Ellison, one of the great technology salesmen, admitted in a\nrecent interview that \u201cmost companies spend too much [on IT] and get very\nlittle in return.\u201d As the opportunities for IT-based advantage continue to\nnarrow, the penalties for overspending will only grow.\n\nStudies of corporate IT spending consistently show that greater expenditures\nrarely translate into superior financial results. In fact, the opposite is\nusually true.\n\nIT management should, frankly, become boring. The key to success, for the vast\nmajority of companies, is no longer to seek advantage aggressively but to\nmanage costs and risks meticulously. If, like many executives, you\u2019ve begun to\ntake a more defensive posture toward IT in the last two years, spending more\nfrugally and thinking more pragmatically, you\u2019re already on the right course.\nThe challenge will be to maintain that discipline when the business cycle\nstrengthens and the chorus of hype about IT\u2019s strategic value rises anew.\n\n1\\. \u201cInformation technology\u201d is a fuzzy term.
