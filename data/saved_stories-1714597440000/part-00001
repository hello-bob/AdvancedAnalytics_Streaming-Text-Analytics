A\nstressor is any physical (e.g., radiation), chemical (e.g., pesticides), or\nbiological entity (e.g., microbes) that can induce an adverse response. EPA\nuses risk assessments to characterize the nature and magnitude of health risks\nto humans and ecological receptors (e.g., plants and animals) from chemical\ncontaminants and other stressors.\n\nLearn more about risk and EPA\u2019s risk assessment process.\n\n## Assessing Pollutants Found in Biosolids through Risk Assessment\n\n40 CFR Part 503 was developed based on the results of risk assessments to\nidentify what, if any, risks were associated with the use or disposal of\nbiosolids via land application, surface disposal, or incineration.\n\nThe top priority of EPA\u2019s Biosolids Program is to assess the potential human\nhealth and environmental risk posed by pollutants found in biosolids.\nPollutants found in biosolids vary in space and time, depending on industrial\nand other inputs to individual wastewater treatment facilities. The presence\nof a pollutant in biosolids alone does not necessarily mean that the biosolids\npose risk to human health and the environment (i.e., the pollutant has to\npresent at a level above which toxic effects are known or anticipated to\noccur). Potential harm from a pollutant is determined by conducting a risk\nassessment. Risk assessment is a scientific process that considers two primary\nfactors: 1) exposure (i.e., how much contact a person or ecological receptor,\nsuch as plants or fish, has with the contaminant in environmental media due to\ncontamination of biosolids); and 2) the toxicity of the pollutant.\n\nThe Biosolids Program has developed a framework to evaluate risks from\nexposure to chemicals in biosolids. The framework consists of three steps: 1)\nprioritize chemicals for assessment, 2) screen for human health and\nenvironmental risk, and 3) perform a refined risk assessment for chemicals\nthat fail the screen. The Biosolids Program has requested that EPA\u2019s Science\nAdvisory Board (SAB) review this proposed framework and provide input on the\napproach. The risk assessment approach was reviewed by the SAB and the final\nreported was published in October 2023.\n\n  * Science Advisory Board: Approach to Biosolids Chemical Risk Assessment and Biosolids Screening Tool\n\n    * Download the Biosolids Screening Tool (BST) (zip) and BST Supporting Documents (zip) . The BST is a multimedia, multipathway, multireceptor deterministic, problem formulation, and screening-level model that can estimate high-end human and ecological hazards based on potential exposures associated with land application of biosolids or placement of biosolids in a surface disposal unit. The results can be used to identify pollutants, pathways, and receptors of greatest interest and to inform decisions about the need to perform more refined modeling or to address data gaps or uncertainties. The BST supporting documents provide additional details for model evaluation and the sources for literature references. A user guide for the BST is provided in the folder labeled 'Help'.\n  * A Guide to the Biosolids Risk Assessments for the EPA Part 503 Rule This guide was prepared to provide an understanding of the risk assessment process that was conducted as a basis for the Part 503 biosolids rule. The document 1) describes the risk assessment procedures used to develop Part 503 pollutant limits; 2) provides historical accounting and discussion of the steps taken during risk assessment; 3) discusses the issues that arose during the risk assessment process and their resolutions; 4) explains assumptions and policy decisions; and 5) answers commonly asked questions.\n\n## Status of Risk Assessment Work on Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances\n(PFAS) Found in Biosolids\n\nThe EPA committed in the agency\u2019s PFAS Strategic Roadmap to conduct a\nbiosolids risk assessment for two PFAS compounds, perfluorooctanoic acid\n(PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), in biosolids. The assessment\nis currently underway and is expected to be published by the end of 2024.\nAfter the risk assessment is complete, the EPA will engage in risk management\nto decide how to manage PFOA and PFOS in biosolids, if necessary. EPA will use\nthe results of the risk assessment in addition to other factors including\neconomics and technological feasibility in the risk management process.\n\n  * PFAS Strategic Roadmap: EPA's Commitments to Action 2021-2024\n\nProblem formulation is the first step in conducting a risk assessment is\nproblem formulation which 1) articulates the purpose for the assessment; 2)\ndefines the problem (source and occurrence); 3) identifies the conceptual\nexposure pathways; and 4) presents data and tools used for analyzing and\ncharacterizing risk. The problem formulation process also involves engagement\nwith states and tribes, risk managers, scientists, and members of the\nbiosolids community regarding foreseeable science and implementation issues.\nProblem formulation for PFOA and PFOS was completed in November 2020.\n\n  * Summary of the EPA Biosolids PFOA & PFOS Problem Formulation Meeting 2020 (pdf)\n\n  * Biosolids Home\n  * Basic Information\n  * Biosolids Laws and Regulations\n  * Technical Resources for Biosolids Managers\n  * Pathogen Equivalency Committee\n  * Biosolids Library\n  * EPA Regional and State Biosolids Coordinators\n\nContact Us to ask a question, provide feedback, or report a problem.\n\nLast updated on February 28, 2024\n\n## Discover.\n\n  * Accessibility Statement\n  * Budget & Performance\n  * Contracting\n  * EPA www Web Snapshot\n  * Grants\n  * No FEAR Act Data\n  * Plain Writing\n  * Privacy\n  * Privacy and Security Notice\n\n## Connect.\n\n  * Data\n  * Inspector General\n  * Jobs\n  * Newsroom\n  * Regulations.gov\n  * Subscribe\n  * USA.gov\n  * White House\n\n## Ask.\n\n  * Contact EPA\n  * EPA Disclaimers\n  * Hotlines\n  * FOIA Requests\n  * Frequent Questions\n\n## Follow.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
