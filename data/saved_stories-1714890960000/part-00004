The auction,\nfirst covered by Tom's Hardware on Wednesday, has closed after 27 bidders\ncontended for a piece of supercomputing history.\n\nThe Cheyenne supercomputer's 6-figure sale price comes with 8,064 Intel Xeon\nE5-2697 v4 processors with 18 cores / 36 threads at 2.3 GHz, which hover\naround $50 (\u00a340) a piece on eBay. Paired with this armada of processors is 313\nTB of RAM split between 4,890 64GB ECC-compliant modules, which command around\n$65 (\u00a350) per stick online. For a deeper dive into Cheyenne's components and\nprime performance, check out our initial sale coverage. Unfortunately for\nbuyers, none of the Cheyenne supercomputer's 32 petabytes of high-speed\nstorage are being sold with the lot. Still, a savvy eBay seller could flip the\nprocessors and RAM across the machines for around $700,000 (\u00a3550,000), making\na hefty profit.\n\nThis estimate assumes all of the CPUs and RAM sticks work, which is invalid.\nThe auction site disclaims that \"approximately 1% of nodes experienced failure\n[over the last six months], primarily attributed to DIMMs with ECC errors,\nwhich will remain unrepaired.\" This high failure rate is the reason for the\nsale, with upkeep made challenging by the fact that Cheyenne \"is currently\nexperiencing maintenance limitations due to faulty quick disconnects causing\nwater spray.\" These two compounding issues have cost the Cheyenne team undue\ndowntime and repair costs, leading them to look for a replacement.\n\nThe Cheyenne supercomputer array had a rigorous workflow over seven years of\noperation to earn its wear and tear. The array's services were used by\nscientists across the state of Wyoming and the rest of the country when\nneeded. The 5.34 petaflops system was mainly used for weather and climate\nstudies, helping the National Science Foundation better study climate change\nand other Earth-related sciences.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware\n\nIt isn't easy to provide an analysis of how much the government stands to lose\nwith the sale of Cheyenne. We could not find data for the price of Cheyenne at\nconstruction, but its predecessor, Yellowstone, was quoted at $25-35 million\nbefore its construction. Some of this cost may be attributed to buildings and\ninfrastructure surrounding the supercomputer. Still, with Cheyenne's\nreplacement, the Derecho, costing $35-40 million from HP, Cheyenne likely\ninitially cost around this 8-figure range as well. At a conservative estimate\nof $25 million for the array to be constructed, the auction sale is only 2% of\nthe sticker price of Cheyenne. Good luck finding a 98% off sale at the\nfollowing government surplus sale.\n\nThe buyer will have the joy of moving Cheyenne's 30 server racks (28\nprocessing racks, two air-cooled management racks) out of the facility\nthemselves; the government is not providing transport or including any\nEthernet or optical cabling needed to get the machine up and running. What use\na buyer might have for a malfunctioning and outdated supercomputer array is\nknown only to them, but if you see a flood of Xeon chips hitting the market,\nyou'll have a pretty good idea why.\n\n## Stay on the Cutting Edge\n\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\ntech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.
