Birds, for example, may peck\nat grass when uncertain whether to attack or flee from an opponent; similarly,\na human may scratch their head when they do not know which of two options to\nchoose. Displacement activities may also occur when animals are prevented from\nperforming a single behaviour for which they are highly motivated.\nDisplacement activities often involve actions which bring comfort to the\nanimal such as scratching, preening, drinking or feeding.\n\nIn the assessment of animal welfare, displacement activities are sometimes\nused as evidence that an animal is highly motivated to perform a behaviour\nthat the environment prevents. One example is that when hungry hens are\ntrained to eat from a particular food dispenser and then find the dispenser\nblocked, they often begin to pace and preen themselves vigorously. These\nactions have been interpreted as displacement activities, and similar pacing\nand preening can be used as evidence of frustration in other situations.^[1]\n\nPsychiatrist and primatologist Alfonso Troisi proposed that displacement\nactivities can be used as non-invasive measures of stress in primates. He\nnoted that various non-human primates perform self-directed activities such as\ngrooming and scratching in situations likely to involve anxiety and\nuncertainty, and that these behaviours are increased by anxiogenic (anxiety-\nproducing) drugs and reduced by anxiolytic (anxiety-reducing) drugs. In\nhumans, he noted that similar self-directed behaviour, together with aimless\nmanipulation of objects (chewing pens, twisting rings), can be used as\nindicators of \"stressful stimuli and may reflect an emotional condition of\nnegative affect\".^[2]\n\nMore recently the term 'displacement activity' has been widely adopted ^[3]\n^[4] to describe a form of procrastination. It is commonly used in the context\nof what someone does intentionally to keep themselves busy whilst, at the same\ntime, avoiding doing something else that would be a better use of their time.\n\n## History of the concept[edit]\n\nIn 1940, two Dutch researchers Kortlandt^[5] and Tinbergen^[6] independently\nidentified^[7] what was to become known as displacement activities. The\nsubsequent development of research on displacement activities arose from\nKonrad Lorenz's works on instincts.\n\nTinbergen in 1952 noted, for example, that \"two skylarks engaged in furious\ncombat [may] suddenly peck at the ground as if they were feeding\", or birds on\nthe point of mating may suddenly begin to preen themselves. Tinbergen adopted\nthe term \"displacement activities\" because the behaviour appeared to be\ndisplaced from one behavioural system into another.^[8]\n\nIn 1902, in The Little White Bird,^[9] J. M. Barrie refers to sheep in\nKensington Gardens nibbling the grass in nervous agitation immediately after\nbeing shorn, and to Solomon, the wise crow, drinking water when he was\nfrustrated and outwitted in an argument with other birds. Another bird\nencourages him to drink in order to compose himself. These references to\ndisplacement activities in a work of literature indicate that the phenomenon\nwas well recognized at the turn of the twentieth century.^[10] A further early\ndescription of a displacement activity (though not the use of the term) is by\nJulian Huxley in 1914.^[11]^[12]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Displacement (psychology)\n  * Ethogram\n  * Procrastination\n  * Vacuum activity\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Duncan, I.J.H., (1970).
