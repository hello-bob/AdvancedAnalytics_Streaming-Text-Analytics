Scott, released a report Wednesday\nthat provided an assessment of NASA's readiness to launch the Artemis II\nmission next year. This is an important flight for the space agency because,\nwhile the crew of four will not land on the Moon, it will be the first time\nhumans have flown into deep space in more than half a century.\n\nThe report did not contain any huge surprises. In recent months the biggest\nhurdle for the Artemis II mission has been the performance of the heat shield\nthat protects the Orion spacecraft during its fiery reentry at more than\n25,000 mph from the Moon.\n\nAlthough NASA downplayed the heat shield issue in the immediate aftermath of\nthe uncrewed Artemis I flight in late 2022, it is clear that the unexpected\ndamage and charring during that uncrewed mission is a significant concern. As\nrecently as last week, Amit Kshatriya, who oversees development for the\nArtemis missions in NASA's exploration division, said the agency is still\nlooking for the root cause of the problem.\n\nThis week's report from the inspector general\u2014an independent office charged\nwith investigating crime, fraud, waste, and mismanagement involving NASA\nprograms\u2014provides some additional details but does not change the overall\nconclusion. The unresolved issues with the heat shield pose a significant risk\nto NASA's plans to launch Artemis II in September 2025. Probably the most\nnotable new information came in the form of two images that showed previously\nundisclosed details about the deep divots in the Orion heat shield after\nArtemis I.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## A bit peeved\n\nHowever, what was striking about this report is NASA's response. Buried at the\nend, on page 36, there is a distinct tone of petulance in the remarks from\nCatherine Koerner, the associate administrator for Exploration Systems\nDevelopment Mission Directorate. Her role at NASA, in effect, is to oversee\ndevelopment of Orion and other hardware used for missions into deep space.\n\nAfter concurring with each of the six recommendations in the inspector\ngeneral's report, Koerner made the following comment:\n\n\"NASA is dedicated to continuous enhancement of our processes and procedures\nto ensure safety and address potential risks and deficiencies,\" she wrote.\n\"However, the redundancy in the above recommendations does not help to ensure\nwhether NASA\u2019s programs are organized, managed, and implemented economically,\neffectively, and efficiently.\"\n\nA careful reading of the second sentence reveals that Koerner feels that the\ninspector general's efforts are both redundant and unhelpful. This is not\naccidental language. Koerner's response was certainly reviewed by NASA's\nsenior managers, who could have flagged and removed the text. And yet they\nwent through with it.\n\n## So what\u2019s going on here?\n\nNASA officials are clearly feeling the pressure when it comes to Artemis. The\nsecond mission, a flyby around the Moon, is supposed to be the relatively easy\none. The really difficult mission, a lunar landing involving Orion docking\nwith SpaceX's Starship in lunar orbit, is much more ambitious. Politically,\nthere is a lot of pressure to deliver on both, and Congress is watching\nclosely as NASA faces probable delays.\n\nThis week, during a hearing of the House Science, Space, & Technology\nCommittee to consider NASA's budget for fiscal year 2025, the very first\nquestion from Chairman Frank Lucas concerned possible changes to Artemis III.\nReferring to an article in Ars Technica about NASA's internal deliberations\nabout modifying the mission profile to have Orion and Starship dock in low-\nEarth orbit, Lucas asked the NASA administrator what was happening.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### What Happens to the Developers When AI Can Code? | Ars Frontiers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n42\n\nEric Berger Eric Berger is the senior space editor at Ars Technica, covering\neverything from astronomy to private space to wonky NASA policy, and author of\nthe book Liftoff, about the rise of SpaceX.
