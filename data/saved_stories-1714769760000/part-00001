In logic,\nthey teach that such abductive reasoning can lead to incorrect conclusions \u2014\nand it can.\n\nBut here in marketing, we draw a different conclusion from the duck test. It\u2019s\nhow most peoples\u2019 minds work so we shouldn\u2019t fight against it. There are two\ncommon ways that marketers fail the duck test and we\u2019ll cover both of them \u2014\nand what to do instead \u2014 in this post.\n\nDeny Thy Father and Refuse Thy Name Many marketers are eager to pretend that\ntheir product is the latest in-vogue thing (e.g., AI), and can get so busy\ndressing it up in the latest tech fashion, that they generate more confusion\nthan sales opportunities.\n\nIt\u2019s like a replay of the clich\u00e9d movie scene: Man: Who are you? Woman: Who do\nyou want me to be, baby?\n\nWhen someone asks your company the equivalent of \u201cwho are you?\u201d [1], you need\nto answer the question and that answer needs to be clear.\n\nRemember, the enemy for most startups isn\u2019t the competition. It\u2019s confusion.\nThe easiest thing for a prospect to do is nothing. If we talk and I leave\nconfused, then I\u2019ll just write off the wasted half-hour and go on with my day.\n\nConsider an answer like this [2] [3], to the question \u201cwhat is MarkLogic?\u201d\n\nI mean great question. We ask ourselves that all the time. It\u2019s actually hard\nto answer because there\u2019s nothing else like it. Answering that is like trying\nto explain the difference between a Cessna and a 747 to someone who\u2019s never\nseen an airplane. Our marketing people call it an XML Server, but that\u2019s not a\ngreat description.\n\nWhat is it really? Literally, it\u2019s what you get when you lock two search\nengine PhDs in a garage for two years and tell them to build a database. You\nknow, it looks like a database from the outside, but when you pop open the\nhood \u2014 surprise \u2014 you find that it\u2019s built from search engine parts. Search\nengine style indexing. And it\u2019s schema-free like a search engine so it can\nhandle unstructured, semi-structured, and, of course, structured data as well.\nLet\u2019s get into those exciting distinctions in a minute.\n\nThis thing \u2014 whatever you want to call it \u2014 it\u2019s the Vegomatic of a data: it\nslices and dices and chops in every conceivable way. In the end, I think what\nmakes it hard to understand is that it\u2019s basically a hybrid: half search\nengine, half content application platform, and all database.\n\nIs that clear?\n\nAs mud. What\u2019s wrong with that answer?\n\n  * It\u2019s confusing\n  * It\u2019s long\n  * It\u2019s navel-gazing (let\u2019s talk about me)\n  * It\u2019s bleeding on the customer (sharing internal troubles)\n\nIt\u2019s a horrible, horrible answer.\n\nNow before you stop reading, perhaps thinking that this is one specific, dated\ncase study, let me say that I could easily write such a parody for about a\nquarter of the twenty-something startups I work with today. This is not some\nancient example from another world. This is a current problem for many\nstartups, but I\u2019m not going to parody any of them here [4]. Might you suffer\nfrom this problem? Go listen to some Gong or Chorus recordings, particularly\nhigh funnel (e.g., SDR) and/or discovery calls, and see if anything resonates.\n\nNow, let\u2019s contrast the previous answer with this one:\n\nIt\u2019s an XML database system, meaning it\u2019s a database that uses XML documents\nas its native data modeling element. Now, what did you want to do with it\nagain?\n\nWhat\u2019s nice about this answer?\n\n  * It\u2019s short\n  * It\u2019s clear\n  * It\u2019s correct\n  * It leaves an opportunity for follow-up questions [5]\n\nBut the really nice part of this answer is that it puts focus back on the\ncustomer. The direct cost of all the previous blather is confusion. The\nopportunity cost of all that blather is you waste precious time you could have\nspent listening to the customer, learning more about their problem, and trying\nto decide if you can solve it.\n\nSo why didn\u2019t some of our sellers want to give the second answer? They didn\u2019t\nwant to say the X word. XML was cool for a while, but that quickly passed and\nXML databases were always distinctly uncool. So, some sellers would rather\nspend five minutes tap dancing around the question rather than directly\nanswering it.\n\nWhat followed was almost always a difficult conversation [6]. But the flaw in\ntap-dancing was simple: the customer is going to figure it out anyway [7].\nCustomers are smart. If:\n\n  * It stores data like a database\n  * Builds indexes like a database\n  * And has a query language like a database\n\nThen \u2014 quack, quack \u2014 it\u2019s a database.\n\nThat\u2019s the first way marketers fail the duck test. They\u2019re afraid to say what\nthe product is for fear of scaring people off. But there\u2019s another way to fail\nthe duck test.\n\nConfusing Products and Solutions The second way to fail the duck test is to\nrotate so hard to solutions that you basically refuse to say what the product\nis. You end up dodging the question entirely.\n\nCustomer: So, what is it? Vendor: You can use it to build things, like a deck.\nCustomer: That\u2019s great, but what is it? Vendor: You can use it to assemble\nthings, too, like a bed. Customer: Sure, but what is it? Vendor: And you can\nuse it for disassembling things too. Customer: Wait, it\u2019s a drill isn\u2019t it?\n\nHere we have the prospect playing twenty questions to figure out what the\nproduct is. Yes, we all know that customers buy solutions to problems [8] and\nTheodore Levitt\u2019s classic example of buying 1/4\u2032\u2032 holes, not 1/4\u2032\u2032 bits.\n\nBut we\u2019re not supposed to take that in a fundamentalist way. If the customer\nasks, \u201cwhat is it?\u201d then the answer is not, \u201ca thing that makes holes\u201d but, \u201ca\npower drill with a 1/4 inch bit.\u201d If they ask why ours is better, we say\nbecause our bits are titanium and don\u2019t break. Feature need not be a four-\nletter word in order to remember that the purpose of the drill is to make a\nhole and, transitively, that the purpose of the hole is to assemble a new deck\nwith the ultimate benefit of quality family time.\n\nThe point is: knowing what solutions (or use-cases) we want to target does not\neliminate the requirement to have strong product messaging. Particularly in\nunexciting categories, we will need to lead with use-cases, not product,\ncategory, or leadership. But, inevitably, even when you lead with use-cases,\nyou will get the question: what is it?\n\nAnd a short, clear answer \u2013 as we discussed above \u2013 not only gets the customer\nwhat they want, but it lets us have more time for listening and discovery. I\nsee many companies where they rotate so hard to use-case marketing that they\nhave product messaging that\u2019s so weak it actually interferes with discussions\nabout the use-case.\n\nFor example, say the product is a data streaming platform (DSP) and the use-\ncase is industrial monitoring for manufacturing facilities. Let\u2019s assume that\ndata streaming platforms are not a hot category, so there aren\u2019t a lot of\npeople out shopping for them. That means we\u2019re not going to target DSP\nshoppers with a product-oriented superiority message, instead, we are going to\ntarget people who have a problem with industrial monitoring.\n\nBut when one of those people asks what it is, we\u2019re not going to say, \u201ca\nthingy that helps you do industrial monitoring.\u201d Instead, we\u2019re going to say,\n\u201cit\u2019s a data streaming platform, and many of our customers use it for\nindustrial monitoring, and here\u2019s why it\u2019s such a great fit for that use-\ncase.\u201d\n\nThat is, we map to the use-case. We don\u2019t redefine the product around the use-\ncase. We don\u2019t try to use the use-case to avoid talking about the product.\nDoing either only confuses people because eventually they figure out it\u2019s not\nan industrial monitoring application, but indeed a data streaming platform\nthat can be used for industrial monitoring. Unless we are clear that it\u2019s a\nplatform being used for a use-case, then we fail the duck test.\n\nIn the end, you will get the right answer if you always remember three things\n\n  * Customers are smart\n  * Time spent in hazy product explanations confuses people and steals time from discovery\n  * If it walks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck \u2014 then, for marketing purposes at least \u2014 it\u2019s a duck.\n\n# # #\n\nNotes\n\n[1] That is, \u201cwhat is it?\u201d\n\n[2] I swear this is only partially dramatized, and only because I\u2019ve assembled\nall the fragments into one single response.\n\n[3] This is circa 2008. Presumably much has changed in the intervening 15\nyears.\n\n[4] I obviously don\u2019t use more recent examples as a matter of both\nconfidentiality and discretion.\n\n[5] An obvious one might be, \u201cso if it\u2019s a database, does it speak SQL?\u201d (To\nwhich the answer was \u201cno, it speaks XQuery,\u201d which could lead to another loop\nof hopefully tight question/answer follow-ups.)\n\n[6] Because, simply put, nobody wanted to buy an XML database. Gartner had\ndeclared the category stillborn around 2002 with a note entitled XML DBMS, The\nMarket That Never Was. The way we sold nearly $200M worth of them\n(cumulatively) during my tenure was not to sell the product (that nobody\nwanted) but to sell the problems it could solve.\n\n[7] And when they do, they\u2019re not going to be happy that you seemingly tried\nto deceive them.\n\n[8] Or hire them to do jobs for them, if you prefer the Jobs To Be Done\nframework.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Email\n  * Print\n  * More\n\n  * Pinterest\n  * Facebook\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nThis entry was posted in Marketing, Positioning, SaaS, Sales, Startups and\ntagged Category Creation, messaging.
