Water experts think the river outlet works may soon become the\nonly way to pass water from Lake Powell, situated in far northern Arizona, to\nthe Colorado River on the other side. Experts worry that damage to those tubes\ncould impede the ability to use them regularly.\n\nGet top headlines and KUNC reporting directly to your mailbox each week when\nyou subscribe to In The NoCo.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest twist in the saga of Glen Canyon Dam, which has been at the\ncenter of recent concern about the shrinking Colorado River, even before news\nof the damaged pipes came to light. Water experts fear Lake Powell could drop\nso low that water would be unable to pass through hydropower turbines that\ngenerate electricity for about 5 million people across seven states. If it\nfalls even lower, water would be unable to pass through the dam at all,\nkeeping it out of the Grand Canyon just downstream of Lake Powell.\n\nAlex Hager\n\n/\n\nKUNC\n\nGlen Canyon Dam holds back Lake Powell on Nov. 2, 2022. As water levels drop\nto historic lows, conservation groups are highlighting infrastructure issues\ninside the dam and calling for new water management policies that bypass the\ndam entirely.\n\nThe threat of that reality has led nonprofit advocacy groups to sound the\nalarm.\n\n\u201cI think it's really important for people to recognize how much of a threat\nthis is to our water delivery system,\u201d said Eric Balken, executive director of\nthe Glen Canyon Institute. \u201cThis is a really big infrastructure problem, and\nit has a big impact on how water is managed throughout this whole basin.\u201d\n\nThe recent damage to the outlet works is the product of a process called\n\u201ccavitation.\u201d It happens when small air bubbles in the water pop while passing\nthrough the dam\u2019s plumbing. That implosion is strong enough to create shock\nwaves that tear away small chunks of protective coating on the insides of\npipes.\n\nIn recent years, the outlet works has been used to release temporary bursts of\nwater designed to boost ecosystems in the Grand Canyon. The cavitation damage\nwas discovered during inspections of the pipes after a series of those planned\nwater bursts in April 2023.\n\nIn an informational webinar on Monday, Reclamation officials explained the\ndamage and said it was not the result of one specific event, but has occurred\nover time.\n\nNick Williams, Upper Colorado River power manager for the Bureau of\nReclamation said cavitation damage is more likely when reservoir levels are\nlow.\n\nThe river outlet works can still carry water, but will require repairs \u2013 such\nas a fresh coating of epoxy that is scheduled for either later this year or\nearly 2025.\n\n## Legal risk and harm to fish\n\nEven with a fully functioning river outlet works system, those pipes are only\ncapable of carrying a relatively small amount of water. If the outlet works\nbecome the only means of passing water through the dam, the Colorado River\u2019s\nUpper Basin states \u2013 Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico, and Utah \u2013 could fail to\nmeet a longstanding legal obligation to pass a certain amount of water to\ntheir downstream neighbors each year.\n\nThe Colorado River Compact, a 1922 legal agreement that forms the foundation\nof modern water management in the arid West, requires the Upper Basin to pass\n7.5 million acre-feet of water to the Lower Basin states of California,\nArizona and Nevada each year.\n\nAn acre-foot is the amount of water needed to fill one acre of land to a\nheight of one foot. One acre-foot generally provides enough water for one to\ntwo households for a year.\n\nAlex Hager\n\n/\n\nKUNC\n\nMarkers on the side of the Glen Canyon dam, pictured on Nov. 2, 2022, once\ntracked the elevation of Lake Powell. With the nation's second-largest\nreservoir at 32% of its original capacity, water now falls below the lowest\nmarker.\n\nLake Powell is often described as the Colorado River\u2019s \u201csavings account,\u201d\nwhere the Upper Basin states stash water to make sure there\u2019s always enough to\nmeet their legal requirement to send some downstream. Then, the Lower Basin\nstores those water deliveries in Lake Mead, its \u201cchecking account.\u201d Mead, he\nnation\u2019s largest reservoir, holds water that will eventually flow to cities\nsuch as Las Vegas, Phoenix and Los Angeles, as well as sprawling farm fields\nin California and Arizona.\n\nConservation groups have cited the limited capacity of the outlet works in\nprevious calls to change the way Lake Powell is managed. The recent damage,\nthey said, could make the outlet works unusable, only worsening the challenge\nof keeping water flowing downstream from Lake Powell.\n\n\u201cIf you lose your job, you don't go out and buy yourself an elaborate dinner,\njustifying it by saying, \u2018I still have money in my checking account,\u2019\u201d said\nZach Frankel, executive director of the Utah Rivers Council. \u201cYou go, \u2018Wow, I\nlost my income. I better look at my expense budget and see if it's time to\ntighten my belt.\u2019 The Colorado River Basin has not yet learned to do that.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, Lake Powell has barely stayed high enough for water to pass\nthrough hydropower turbines. That\u2019s the result of a shell game by water\nmanagers, who have shuffled water into Lake Powell from upstream reservoirs on\nan emergency basis.\n\nDamage to the outlet works also raises concern about invasive fish entering a\nsection of the Colorado River that flows through the Grand Canyon. Dropping\nwater levels have allowed invasive smallmouth bass to swim through to the\nother side, where they can eat native humpback chub, a species protected by\nthe Endangered Species Act.\n\nRecently, federal water managers released plans to help protect those at-risk\nchubs. Those plans partially hinge on the ability to release cold water\nthrough the river outlet works and into the Grand Canyon. Wildlife advocates\ncriticized those plans even before the news of damage to the river outlet\nworks, which could further jeopardize native fish conservation efforts.\n\n## Fixes for the future\n\nThe seven states which use the Colorado River are currently caught in a\nstandoff about how to cut back on water demand. They are currently negotiating\na new set of rules for sharing the river, designed to replace the current\nguidelines that expire in 2026\u2014but are stuck at an ideological impasse.\n\nThat new set of rules could theoretically introduce a long-term plan for\nmanaging the West\u2019s major reservoirs sustainably, allowing water managers to\nmove on from a patchwork of emergency measures that have only temporarily\nstaved off problems at Glen Canyon Dam.\n\nAlex Hager\n\n/\n\nKUNC\n\nA set of four tubes known as the \"river outlet works,\" pictured on Nov. 2,\n2022, could soon be the only way for water to make it through Glen Canyon Dam.\nRecently-discovered damage to those tubes has raised questions about their\nrole going forward.\n\nBalken, with the nonprofit Glen Canyon Institute, said policymakers should\nconsider major changes to how the dam is operated.\n\n\u201cIf we're going to update this river system to be climate resilient, and if\nwe're going to upgrade our infrastructure to deal with what climate change is\nhanding us, we really have to take a hard look at bypassing Glen Canyon Dam,\u201d\nBalken said.\n\nIn March, Upper Basin and Lower Basin states each released competing plans for\npost-2026 river management. Later a coalition of environmental nonprofits\nreleased their own. A group of tribes that use the Colorado River has issued a\nset of principles it hopes will be incorporated into future water management.\n\nThe Biden administration is urging states to find compromise before the end of\n2024, in hopes of averting any complication that could be brought on by a\nchange in presidential administration following the November election.\n\nThis story is part of ongoing coverage of water in the West, produced by KUNC\nin Colorado and supported by the Walton Family Foundation.
