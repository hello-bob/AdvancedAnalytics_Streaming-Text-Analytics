All of them include the latest Linux\nkernel 6.8, they all offer the latest GNOME 46 desktop whose beta we checked\nout in February, and the majority of them include the latest KDE Plasma 6\ndesktop as well.\n\nThe first out was EndeavourOS Gemini. We last looked at EndeavourOS for the\nArtemis release in 2022. It's a lightweight and easier-to-install Arch-Linux-\nbased distro, and since it's a rolling release, what new releases really mean\nis updated installation media, so you don't need to waste hours on updating\nonce it's installed. This release includes KDE Plasma 6.0.4, with a choice of\nX11 or Wayland sessions, plus new nVidia binary driver packages direct from\nupstream, and improved installation and update tools. One thing it doesn't\ninclude, though, is an edition for Arm processors: due to a lack of manpower,\nthe project dropped Arm support.\n\n### What's under the Big Purple Hat?\n\nThe next day, Fedora 40 came out, as we predicted when we looked at the\nrelease candidate. We covered the highlights then, but it may be worth noting\na few things that have been removed from this version, including Delta RPMs,\nOpenSSL 1.1, and Python 3.7. Fedora 40's default is now Python 3.12, since 3.7\nis end of life \u2013 but although it too has expired and gone to meet its maker,\nPython 3.6 is still available, in case you need to target RHEL 8.\n\nFedora isn't so much a distro as a whole distro family in its own right, in a\nprofusion of different editions. The family has five main variants: Fedora\nWorkstation is the flagship GNOME desktop, plus ten more Fedora Spins with\ndifferent desktops and an additional four more Atomic Desktops, which are\nimmutable graphical distros. Two of these, Fedora KDE Plasma Desktop and its\nimmutable sibling Fedora Kinoite, include the latest KDE Plasma 6 desktop,\nwith only Wayland sessions available by default.\n\nThen, alongside these, there are Fedora Server, Fedora IoT for \"edge\" devices,\nFedora Cloud intended for deployment into either local or remote VMs, and\nFedora CoreOS which is a minimalist, immutable, self-updating container host.\n\nWe make that 19 different editions, so there should be something for everyone\nin there. Although Fedora doesn't have LTS releases as such, it is the\nupstream for the somewhat-maligned CentOS Stream, which is Red Hat's slower-\nmoving free enterprise distro. Many Red Hat users favored Stream's\npredecessor, CentOS Linux, for its much closer RHEL compatibility, but even\nso, CentOS Stream has some very large scale users. For example, the Building\nthe Future talk at the 2022 South California Linux Expo confirmed that\nFacebook parent Meta uses CentOS Stream extensively. Fedora 40 is going to be\nthe basis for the future CentOS Stream 10, which in turn means that one day it\nwill become RHEL 10.\n\n### Over in orange country\n\nJust a day after Fedora 40 came Ubuntu 24.04 \"Noble Numbat\". This is a long-\nterm support release, so some people will be using this at least until 2026 or\nso \u2013 although users of the current LTS, 22.04 \"Jammy Jellfish\", won't get a\nmessage offering to upgrade until 24.04.1, which is planned to appear on\nAugust 15th. If you are using 23.10, though \u2013 perhaps in an attempt to get\nfewer nags about Ubuntu Pro \u2013 you will get nudged much sooner.\n\nCanonical started some twenty years ago, meaning that 24.04 is also the\ncompany's tenth LTS release \u2013 the first being Ubuntu 6.06 \"Dapper Drake\",\nwhich is when the Reg started to cover this upstart distro, aside from a\npassing mention of 5.04 \"Hoary Hedgehog\".\n\nTo get an idea of what to expect, we looked at the beta version a couple of\nweeks ago. Unlike the others, this release doesn't feature KDE Plasma 6 \u2013 or\nLXQt 2 \u2013 although the Qt based flavors will offer updates later.\n\nAway from the shiny desktop side of things, some of the fresh features include\nsupport for the new bcachefs file system, and the kernel will include low-\nlatency support by default. It also includes frame pointers by default, which\nhas a very small performance overhead \u2013 less than a per cent \u2013 but enables\nprofiling with bpftrace among other tools. For more information, the Noble\nkernel has its own release notes.\n\nFor the first time, the server and main desktop edition both use the new\nSubiquity installer, with improved installation automation support. \"Noble\"\noffers experimental support for TPM-backed full-disk encryption, and for\nguided installation onto ZFS. Noble supports Intel's QuickAssist compression\nand cryptography acceleration if the host machine has the appropriate Intel\nchippery. There's some Redmond-hued integration including .NET 8, as well as\nautomatic enrollment into Microsoft Active Directory thanks to ADSys GPO\nsupport.\n\nThe company has full release notes, although it's leaving the notes for its\nindividual flavors up to the respective projects. The Reg FOSS desk has not\nlooked at all the flavors yet. Two flavors have new releases of their\nrespective desktops. Ubuntu Kylin 24.04 offers UKUI 4, which although\nunderrated in the West is one of the more attractive Linux desktops out there.\nUbuntu Cinnamon 24.04 includes the Cinnamon 6 desktop from the latest\nLinuxMint. Alongside the differences in Lubuntu and Kubuntu, which we already\ncovered, there are interesting changes in Xubuntu and Ubuntu Unity, which we\nplan to return to in the near future.\n\n### Enter the Dragon(fish)\n\nAlthough TrueNAS Scale 24.04 was also released on Tuesday, we've left it until\nlast because this is a different sort of product to the earlier, more general-\npurpose distros.\n\n  * Valkey publishes release candidate and attracts new backer\n  * AlmaLinux 9.4 beta prepares to tread where RHEL dares not\n  * Gentoo Linux tells AI-generated code contributions to fork off\n  * Torvalds intentionally complicates his use of indentation in Linux Kconfig\n\nLast month, we mentioned that iXsystems is relegating its FreeBSD based NAS\ndistro to maintenance status, although the company reassured Reg sister site\nBlocks and Files that nobody would be marooned by the change. This means that\nthe future of iXsystems' NAS OSes is the Debian Linux-based TrueNAS Scale. We\nmentioned in passing that this was then at version 23.10.\n\nThat has changed with the release of a new version, TrueNAS 24.04\n\"Dragonfish.\" As its release notes detail, this version is still based on\nDebian 12 and OpenZFS version 2.3.3 so it's not a huge change. All the same,\nthe company has modernized significant components, including an updated\nkernel, version 6.6.20, based on the latest LTS kernel release.\n\nThe SMB and NFS status pages in the web GUI have been improved, and there's an\noptional backup status widget for the main dashboard page, and other parts of\nthe UI have been streamlined. There's a new auditing logging feature to track\nwhich admin changed what setting and when. \"Dragonfish\" can talk to a FreeIPA\nserver to do LDAP authentication.\n\nThe announcement flags two other features as contributed by the user\ncommunity: TrueNAS Scale now offers Linux containers called Sandboxes based on\nsystemd-nspawn, and there's a new Developer mode to aid customizing the OS,\nwhich is normally locked down to prevent this.\n\nThere's a full changelog with all of the dozens of fixes in this release. Our\nimpression is that the path of TrueNAS Scale continues a strong corporate\nfocus, which should be enough to distinguish it from the already crowded NAS\ndistro field, many of which aim more at home users, media servers and so on. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Linux\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Linux\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Asahi Linux\n  * CentOS\n  * Debian\n  * Fedora\n  * GNOME\n  * Linux Foundation\n  * One Way Forward\n  * Windows Subsystem for Linux\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * FOSS\n  * Linus Torvalds\n  * Operating System\n\n#### More about\n\n6 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Linux\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Linux\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Asahi Linux\n  * CentOS\n  * Debian\n  * Fedora\n  * GNOME\n  * Linux Foundation\n  * One Way Forward\n  * Windows Subsystem for Linux\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * FOSS\n  * Linus Torvalds\n  * Operating System\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Miracle-WM tiling window manager for Mir hits 0.2.0\n\nWhat are Mir and Wayland all about anyway?\n\nSoftware6 days | 14\n\n#### AlmaLinux 9.4 beta prepares to tread where RHEL dares not\n\nCIQ also has an alternative approach to compatible kernels with RockyLinux\n\nOSes12 days | 6\n\n#### Lightweight LXQt 2.0.0 updates to same toolkit as KDE Plasma 6\n\n4-letter survivor's move to Qt 6 means that, love it or hate it, Wayland is\nlooming\n\nOSes9 days | 18\n\n#### Industrial systems integrating digitalisation\n\nHuawei solutions designed to speed up digital and intelligent transformation\nacross key vertical industries\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Fedora 40 is just around the corner with more spins and flavors than ever\n\nKDE edition has the most conspicuous changes, and could become future flagship\n\nOSes7 days | 4\n\n#### Gentoo Linux tells AI-generated code contributions to fork off\n\nA good PR move opines community member\n\nOSes13 days | 21\n\n#### Debian spices up APT package manager with a dash of color, squishes\nancient bug\n\n2.9 gives a taste of what's to come\n\nOSes11 days | 39\n\n#### Torvalds intentionally complicates his use of indentation in Linux\nKconfig\n\nParamount penguin forces more robust whitespace handling\n\nOSes13 days | 90\n\n#### GCC 15 dropping IA64 support is final nail in the coffin for Itanium\narchitecture\n\nUpdated Linux kernel cut it loose, now leading FOSS compiler lands depth-\ncharge on Itanic\n\nApplications17 days | 81\n\n#### German state ditches Windows, Microsoft Office for Linux and LibreOffice\n\n'Complete digital sovereignty' ... sounds familiar\n\nSoftware25 days | 189\n\n#### What can be done to protect open source devs from next xz backdoor drama?\n\nKettle What happened, how it was found, and what your vultures have made of it\nall\n\nResearch23 days | 93\n\n#### Malicious xz backdoor reveals fragility of open source\n\nAnalysis This time, we got lucky.
