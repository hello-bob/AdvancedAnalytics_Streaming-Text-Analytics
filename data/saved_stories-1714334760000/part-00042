Regional Dives: Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Middle East\n\n# Regional Dives: Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Middle East\n\nThese regional breakdowns yield additional insights into the top 20% of global\nAI talent. It is important to note, however, that the sample sizes represented\ncan be quite small. This is particularly the case for the Middle East region,\nfor example, where the total top-tier talent in the sample is fewer than 35.\nThis is also the case for certain individual countries in Europe. Nonetheless,\nwe think these diverse regions are worthwhile to dive into, though we hope you\nview them with the small \u201cN\u201d context in mind.\n\n## Europe\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n  * More than 50% of top-tier AI talent are produced in three European countries, while the vast majority of job opportunities for such talent are concentrated in four countries.\n  * Of the four major AI hubs in Europe, the United Kingdom and Switzerland are heavily dependent on foreign talent, while Germany and France have notably improved their retention of top-tier AI talent.\n  * While Western Europe has long benefitted from a robust university ecosystem, the relative rise of Russia and Greece\u2019s top-tier AI talent is owed to the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and the National Technical University of Athens and University of Patras, respectively.\n  * Outside of academia, however, most of the top-tier AI talent in Europe end up working for American companies that have a significant presence in Europe (e.g. Google\u2019s DeepMind in London and its R&D lab in Zurich).\n\nFigure 1. Where do European top-tier AI talent originate (based on\nundergraduate degree)?\n\nNote: \u201cOthers\u201d include Belgium, Portugal, Slovakia, Ukraine, Finland, the\nNetherlands, Poland, Switzerland, Romania, Sweden, Ireland, Norway, and\nArmenia.\n\nFigure 2.

European countries\u2019 retention of domestic AI talent\n\nNote: Data shows proportion of domestic talent that stay in their home\ncountry.\n\n## Asia-Pacific\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n  * Asia-Pacific countries have made strides in keeping the domestic AI talent they produce, though Australia has moved in the other direction, even slightly increasing its reliance on foreign AI talent.\n  * While China is the obvious elephant in producing top-tier AI talent in the Asia-Pacific, the country, along with South Korea, are the top countries in the region in retaining AI talent. For South Korea, its Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology seems to be a main driver in cultivating and retaining an entirely domestic AI talent pool.\n  * Japan and Singapore appear to have had the worst AI talent retention rates in the Asia-Pacific region, which explains why they\u2019ve fallen off the list in 2022. Since 2019, the former has lost 85% of its top-tier AI talent and the latter has lost 65%.\n\nFigure 1.

Asia-Pacific countries\u2019 retention of domestic AI talent\n\nNote: Data shows proportion of domestic talent that stay in their home\ncountry.\n\n## Middle East\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n  * The Middle East region has seen a relative decline in producing top-tier AI talent over the last few years.\n  * Israel and Iran command the lion\u2019s share of top-tier AI talent supply in the Middle East, while the former dominates the top AI institutions in the region.\n  * Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates have increased their standing as attractive places for top-tier AI talent to work.\n\nFigure 1.
