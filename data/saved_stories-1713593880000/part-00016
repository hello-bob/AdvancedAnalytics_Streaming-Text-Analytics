As primates that evolved through a ruthlessly\ncompetitive process of natural selection, we are endowed with strong self-\nserving and nepotistic instincts. Given that we can often promote our\ninterests by hurting the interests of others, that means we are often strongly\nmotivated to attack, exploit, control, dominate, and eliminate others.\n\nAt the same time, one of the most important and distinctive features of our\nspecies is our reliance on cooperation. Unlike other apes\u2014in fact, unlike all\nother animals\u2014we navigate interdependent social environments organised around\nnorms, reputations, gossip, and status games. We are ultra-social, dependent\non social approval and extensive support to achieve the overwhelming majority\nof our goals.\n\nAlthough this cooperative nature of human social life gives many people the\nwarm fuzzies, it is not an alternative to competition. We cooperate to\ncompete, and the norms, reputational systems, and gossip that sustain human\ncooperation can only be understood against the backdrop of individuals\npursuing their interests.\n\n#### The Survival of the Friendliest?\n\nDan Williams\n\n\u00b7\n\nFeb 29\n\nRead full story\n\nNevertheless, our dependence on cooperation attenuates and complicates certain\nforms of competition and conflict. It is\u2014to put it mildly\u2014difficult to\nmaintain a reputation as prosocial, cooperative, and trustworthy if you are\nseen dominating, controlling, or eliminating others. Further, if you are\nmotivated to engage in such antisocial behaviour, you will only be successful\nif you have extensive social support. In human beings, the most spectacular\nforms of violence and exploitation are almost always team sports.\n\nThese complexities of human social life set the backdrop for demonizing\nnarratives, one of the most important concepts for understanding human\npsychology, society, and politics.\n\n##\n\nThe nature and function of demonizing narratives\n\nHuman beings sometimes believe terrible things about each other. They accuse\nothers of being disgusting and depraved witches plotting against the\ncommunity, murdering children and using their blood in rituals, poisoning\nsociety with evil ideas and norms, and so on.\n\nIn such cases, the beliefs and accusations are often accompanied by actions.\nFor example, throughout history, people punish and sometimes kill those\naccused of witchcraft, and attack and sometimes eliminate groups they view as\nevil and threatening.\n\nIt is tempting in these cases to assume that the actions follow the\nbeliefs\u2014that it is because people hold such beliefs that they are led to\nattack or mistreat others\u2014but in most cases, this gets things backwards.\nRather, it is motivations to eliminate or dominate people viewed as rivals,\nthreats, or burdens that drive people to embrace and propagate demonizing\nnarratives.\n\nAs Hugo Mercier puts it, Voltaire was wrong when he said that \u201cthose who can\nmake you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities\u201d; it is \u201cwanting\nto commit atrocities that makes you believe absurdities\u201d.\n\nDemonizing narratives perform two functions.\n\nFirst, if you want to attack people whilst maintaining a prosocial reputation,\nyou need a justification. Demonizing narratives provide one. If people are\ntruly evil, threatening, or morally depraved, even decent and fair-minded do-\ngooders would want to eliminate them. As Manvir Singh puts it, \u201cActors bent on\neliminating rivals devise demonizing myths to justify their rivals\u2019\nmistreatment\u201d:\n\n> \u201cFolk demonization usually occurs because one group\u2014hereafter, the\n> Campaigners\u2014wants to justify the mistreatment of another\u2014hereafter, the\n> Targets... To mistreat Targets, Campaigners must often gain the approval of\n> other group mates\u2014hereafter, the Condoners. They can secure this approval by\n> promoting sensational myths that justify abusing the Targets.\u201d\n\nFor this to be successful, the narratives need not be very plausible, not\nleast because many Condoners often dislike the Targets and so are eager to\naccept the narratives. Nevertheless, they must be plausible enough that the\nCampaigners and Condoners can credibly appear to believe them. In that case,\ntheir actions will at worst appear to be driven by error, not malice. Given\nthis, the desire to construct demonizing narratives typically creates a\nmarketplace of rationalisations, whereby people are socially rewarded (i.e.,\nwith gratitude and respect) for sharing evidence and arguments that support\nthe narrative.\n\n#### The marketplace of good and bad ideas\n\nDan Williams\n\n\u00b7\n\nMar 29\n\nRead full story\n\nThe second problem solved by demonizing narratives concerns coordination. When\nCampaigners express a demonizing narrative, they leave no doubt about their\nintentions and feelings towards the Targets. This lets others know that if\nthey were to attack the Targets, they could expect the Campaigners\u2019 support.\n\nImportantly, this strategic logic can make it sound like people self-\nconsciously concoct demonizing narratives they know to be false. This might be\ntrue in some cases. However, human beings are instinctive propagandists with\nstrong tendencies to believe the self-serving messages they communicate. When\nit benefits us to push a narrative, we often end up sincerely embracing it,\nboth because this makes us more persuasive and because searching for evidence\nand arguments to persuade others often results in self-persuasion.\n\nOptimally Irrational\n\nThe Truth About Self-Deception\n\nPreamble (Lionel): This is a guest post from David Pinsof.

Here are\njust a few examples.\n\n###\n\nWitches\n\nDemonizing narratives seem central to witchcraft accusations, which emerge in\na strikingly similar form across a wide range of independent cultural\ncontexts. In many cases, the accusations target members of a community viewed\neither as a burden or as possessing too much status. By gradually constructing\na narrative about such Targets that depicts them as supernaturally powerful,\nmorally repugnant, and highly threatening, witchcraft accusations function to\nsignal Campaigners\u2019 hostile intentions towards Targets and justify their\nmistreatment.\n\nSummarising this kind of view, Pascal Boyer writes,\n\n> \u201cIt helps to see witchcraft accusations as a form of stigmatization,\n> providing a coordination point for coalitional alignment against a\n> particular individual... People who have some interest in inflicting harm on\n> a particular individual may use witchcraft accusations rather than a direct\n> attack because the accusation makes it possible to recruit allies against\n> the target, whilst maintaining one\u2019s own reputation.\u201d\n\n###\n\nPogroms, ethnic riots, and genocides\n\nDemonizing narratives also invariably precede pogroms, ethnic riots, and\ngenocides. By depicting Targets as disgusting, evil, and highly\nthreatening\u2014for example, by spreading rumours about horrific things they have\ndone, or by concocting theories about their power and insidious influence on\nsociety\u2014such narratives send unambiguous signals of the Campaigners\u2019 violent\nintentions and justify the Targets\u2019 elimination.\n\n###\n\nConspiracy theories\n\nAs Singh points out, demonizing narratives also seem central to much\nconspiracy theorising. Of course, in some cases (e.g., Nazi conspiracy\ntheories about Jews), this is obvious. However, I suspect that even when it\ncomes to outlandish conspiracy theories today, they often function as\npropaganda specialised for demonizing Targets.\n\nThe QAnon belief that nefarious elites are Satan-worshipping, cannibalistic\npaedophiles does not seem like a genuine attempt to understand the world or\n\u201creduce uncertainty\u201d, as many popular hypotheses in psychology suggest. It\nseems more like a demonizing narrative, one selectively embraced by\ncommunities extremely hostile towards elites and the establishment. By\npainting such elites and the establishment in the most demonic way possible,\nsuch narratives unambiguously signal the conspiracy theorists\u2019 hostility\ntowards the Target\u2014in this case, elites and establishment institutions\u2014and\njustify their endorsement of attacks upon them.\n\n###\n\nThe outgroup\n\nThese are all extreme cases, but the basic logic plays out in roughly similar\nforms across diverse contexts. Whenever people are motivated to attack,\ncontrol, or dominate an individual or group, demonizing narratives are likely\nto emerge.\n\nFor example, partisans of competing groups in democratic politics and modern\nculture wars are often motivated to embrace narratives that demonize the\noutgroup. Although these narratives tend to be much less extreme, this\nprobably has less to do with a difference in their function than with the\ncontext within which they arise. Within modern, secular, and liberal\ndemocracies, murdering political or cultural enemies is not a live option, and\noutlandish, supernatural accusations about witchcraft are unlikely to persuade\nanyone. However, the demand for stories about the \u201cother side\u201d that inflates\ntheir threatening and depraved character remains constant.\n\n###\n\nWeirdos\n\nDemonizing narratives might also help to explain the widespread stigmatisation\nof people who are \u201cdifferent\u201d.\n\nThroughout history and across diverse cultural contexts, individuals and\ngroups with abnormal traits or preferences\u2014people viewed as \u201cweird\u201d,\n\u201cstrange\u201d, \u201codd\u201d, and so on\u2014are often demonized and mistreated, even when\ntheir traits are completely harmless.\n\nThis pattern can seem mysterious and irrational. However, it makes sense once\nyou appreciate that status is relative and people often benefit from\nexploiting others. Given this, you should expect that people will be on the\nlookout for opportunities to dominate, humiliate, and control others. People\nwho are \u201cdifferent\u201d provide such an opportunity. Precisely because they are\ndifferent, the rest of the community can safely gang up to exploit them and\nplace them at the bottom of the status hierarchy. Demonizing narratives can\nhelp them coordinate to achieve this whilst maintaining their prosocial\nreputations among each other.\n\nIn these and more ways, the ubiquity of demonizing narratives in human\nsocieties exposes us to the dark side of human nature. Contrary to popular\nforms of wishful thinking, human beings are not puppies. We are complicated,\ncompetitive, and cooperative apes who conjure up demons in the service of\nconflict and coordination.\n\nDan Williams is a reader-supported publication.

Though I'm a bit confused about\nwhere you land on the extent to which people sincerely believe these\ndemonizing narratives vs people operating on a principle of plausible\ndeniability. You seem to describe it both ways in two adjacent paragraphs,\nthough I'm probably missing some nuance here.
