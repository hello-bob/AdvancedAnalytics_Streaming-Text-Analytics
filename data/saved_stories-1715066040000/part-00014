Each of these players acts out a character within this\nworld and, through their characters, engages in dialogue with one another.\nPerhaps the archetypal example of LARPing describes the sorts of historical\nre-enactments one would find at a mediaeval fair, but the term has been used\nwith increasing frequency to describe people\u2019s relationships to extreme\npolitical alignments. This essay is an inquiry into why LARP has become so\nresonant for understanding the aesthetics of specific political and cultural\nphenomena in the 21st century.\n\n####\n\nAfter Farce\n\nMarx\u2019s famous introduction to the Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte\u2014that\nhistory happens twice, first as tragedy, then as a farce\u2014has become something\nof a leitmotif in the works of artists, cultural critics and journalists\ngrappling with the absurd elements of political agitation in the 21^st\ncentury. Notably, Hal Foster poses the question \u201cWhat comes after farce?\u201d in\nhis 2020 book of the same name; a book cataloguing contemporary art responses\nto existence in the Trump era. However, with its renewed appeal, and with\nsupport from numerous textual and visual examples, a new addendum has emerged:\nLARP comes after farce.\n\nThe notion that LARP historically emerges after farce is incapsulated in a\nquote found within A.M Gittlitz\u2019s biography of Homero Cristalli, better known\nas J. Posadas.\n\n> \u201cWhat we on the Left flatter ourselves in calling our political and even our\n> revolutionary work is in fact nothing of the sort. It is more akin to\n> religious ritual. Mass rallies, newspaper sales, endless meetings, electoral\n> campaigning, street fighting, writing articles that no one will ever read\n> and books absolutely no one will ever get any practical use out of ... In\n> another time, in another place, these rituals may have had a relationship to\n> a broader movement, a broader strategy, and such stirrings have always\n> accompanied revolutionary moments. And so, having no real conception of the\n> thing itself, we try to grasp at revolution by playing out its inessential\n> weirdnesses ad nauseam. This is what comes after farce. This is LARP.\u201d\n\nThis quote comes from Comrade Communicator, the incumbent leader of the\nIntergalactic Workers\u2019 League \u2013 Posadist (IWL-P). The IWL-P is a predominantly\nonline collective situated somewhere between political organisation and meme\npage, and they are some of the contemporary torchbearers of the legacy passed\ndown from J. Posadas. Posadas was an Argentinian revolutionary whose chief\nconviction was to advocate for nuclear war as a tool of communist\naccelerationism. A further influential legacy of his political ideology was\nthe conviction that if advanced extra-terrestrial lifeforms exist, they must\nhave already reached communism, as it provides the only path for organising\nproduction towards the technological level necessary for interstellar travel.\nIt's evident from this quote that Comrade Communicator is acutely aware of the\narbitrariness \u2013 and absurdity \u2013 of deciding to be a Posadist in the 21^st\ncentury. LARP here refers to playing out political actions empty of their\ncapacity to materially advance an emancipatory project. And without these\nbroader material goals, what\u2019s stopping you from being a Posadist?\n\nLARP is not exclusively used to describe left-wing revolutionary politics. In\nher exhibition titled \u2018First as tragedy, then as LARP\u2019, Tomi Faison riffs on\nthe same theme to draw attention to the rioters storming the Capitol on\nJanuary 6, 2021. For Faison, this turn of phrase was helpful to describe the\nfact that these rioters, after successfully breaching the Capitol Hill\nbuilding, were forced to come to terms with their complete inability to do\nanything revolutionary after the fact. Insurrection becomes reduced to banal\nvandalism and bizarre photo-ops. Or, as Faison puts it, \u201cthey were only able\nto generate images\u201d.\n\nMany contemporary movements and organisations across the political,\nideological, and spiritual spectrum still sustain membership, often composed\nof those that appear deeply passionate about their chosen cause. This sits in\ntension with the deeply held belief that under neoliberal capitalism, things\nwill not change. The seeming incapacity to realise a political project beyond\nneoliberal capitalism was aptly described by Mark Fisher in Capitalist\nRealism. Fisher argues that any desire for systemic change in the world is\nplacated by living vicariously through fantasy representations of people\nenacting these changes for themselves. Fisher argues that Capital will always\nfind a way to co-opt revolutionary desire and sell it back to you, often in a\ndefanged and harmless form. To illustrate this point, consider for example the\nmerchandising of Che Guevara\u2019s image on t-shirts, the Guy Fawkes mask, even\nthe Hunger Games or Black Panther movies. Dale Beran, in It Came From\nSomething Awful argues that by being surrounded by this co-option of political\naspiration by capital, we are left with the sense that our subjectivity has\nbeen reduced to being a consumer. Therefore, all that we find ourselves able\nto ask of our political imaginary is that we have media representations\navailable for our consumption that reinforce and signify our political ideals\nand display our \u2018revolutionary\u2019 identity brand.\n\nAn eBay listing advertising a Guy Fawkes/Anonymous mask.\n\nA major consequence of the phenomenon described by Fisher and Beran is that\nrevolutionary politics beyond neoliberal capitalism evolved into politics\nbeing adopted as personal style and performed regardless of their efficacy. In\nThe Trump Effect In Contemporary Art and Visual Culture, Kit Messham-Muir and\nUro\u0161 \u010cvoro pinpoint the historical context for this political moment. They\nattribute it to the political condition that emerged in the thirty years since\nthe fall of the Berlin Wall, described by Francis Fukuyama as the \u2018end of\nhistory\u2019 wherein technocratic, liberal, democratic, free market-based\neconomies would become the inevitable end state of human organisation. Rather\nthan post-ideological neoliberalism becoming the uncontested structure of the\nnew world order, however, Messham-Muir and \u010cvoro describe the current period\nas one defined by \u201cembodied, experientialist, regionalist, biological,\nbiopolitical\u201d identitarianism. Here, much of politics becomes attached to, and\nreduced to, self-expression through images.\n\nThe condition where widespread dissatisfaction with neoliberalism is met with\nthe performance of politics for its aesthetic value and consumption within a\nwider capitalist framework is the condition where political agitation\nperformatively gesturing towards revolution is described as LARP. Describing\npolitical agitation as LARP suggests a more complicated relationship between\nimages and reality than to simply decry these political agitations as na\u00efve\nand disconnected \u2013 indicating a deeper and more considered set of logics and\nmotivations. I argue that the complicated relationship between images and\nreality suggested by the phrase \u2018LARP comes after farce\u2019 can be understood by\nexamining it according to Baudrillard\u2019s notion of simulation and hyperreality.\n\nGreg Guevara, better known as Jreg, runs a YouTube channel which sometimes\ninvolves LARPing as embodiments of extreme political ideologies. In 2022, he\nran for Mayor of Ottawa on a self-described \u201canti-centrist\u201d platform.\n\nBaudrillard published The Precession of Simulacra in 1981, to address the\nimpact mass media had on the subject\u2019s experience of the world. Rapid\ndevelopments in digital technology during this period enabled society to be\nsaturated by photography, advertising, and televisual images. For Baudrillard,\nthis meant that a radical shift had occurred between the late 19th and late\n20th century in terms of what gave objects their value under capitalism; for\nthe masses, objects became valued and desired primarily in terms of image and\naesthetic rather than for utilitarian function. The rise of commodity\nfetishism and the dominance of image saturation informed Baudrillard\u2019s claim\nthat the real could no longer be directly accessed because it was entirely\nobfuscated by simulacra; instead, we could only access a simulation of the\nreal. Epitomising this in the 21^st century is the emergence of parasocial\nrelationships and the sense that interactions between people online are more\naccurately interactions between each other\u2019s images of themselves.\n\nThe Precession of Simulacra belonged squarely within the category of\npostmodernist thought which, according to Frederic Jameson, seemed to be\ninclined towards an \u201cinverted millenarianism\u201d, theorising the pervasive sense\nof an imminent end of everything, and the replacement of the depths of\nauthenticity, essence and signification with the flatness and superficiality\nof appearance. The sense that this theory had reached a logical conclusion for\ncultural analysis gave way for Andreas Huyssen to regard it with suspicion. He\ncriticised it as cynical and unhelpful for the way that it precluded any\nattempt to understand media representations according to their ideological\nfunctions. Arguably, the decades following proved this to not be the case;\nrather, I argue, the ways in which media represent ideological signification\nhad become extraordinarily abstract, superficial, and protean.\n\nIn spite of allegations of cynicism, Baudrillard\u2019s theory of simulation proved\nto be remarkably prescient, providing an effective framework for understanding\nthe cultural impact and function of the internet as a \u2018virtual world\u2019. The\nutility of returning to Baudrillard today is not because he produced any kind\nof \u2018end of theory\u2019, but because in the forty years since theorising the\nsupremacy of appearance and image in the way we understand culture, appearance\nand image has been reimbued with complex signification and depth of meaning.\nThe advent of meme culture, for example, demonstrates the vernacular and\ncommunicative function of images which bear no indexical relationship to the\ndense meaning they convey, and yet, are understood and disseminated by people\non an almost first-language basis. I will return to the relationship between\nthe internet and simulation later on, but this relationship is central towards\nunderstanding the resonance of \u2018LARP\u2019 as a descriptor of political action.\n\n####\n\nLARP and Hyperreality\n\nLARP implies a dual existence of a world of images and a world of the real.\nThe world of images is self-contained, self-referential, and cognitively\nseparate from the world of the real upon which it is overlaid. In order to\nLARP, one must physically participate in the world of the real, and\ncognitively engage in the world of images. LARP also implies a specific mode\nof engaging with the image world distinct from mere spectatorship: LARP is\nactive, not passive. It places the LARPer in the dual position of actor and\nspectator to the image world. The person who LARPs creates their own alternate\nreality, and importantly, is aware that it\u2019s ultimately just fantasy.\n\nThe dual interface with the world of images and the world of the real allows\nus to consider LARP in terms of Baudrillard\u2019s concept of simulation. For\nBaudrillard, a simulation is a mimicry which threatens the difference between\nthe real and the imaginary. A simulation, in every sense, operates in the\nworld of images; its internal referents bear no relation to reality, only to\nother images. Consider the mediaeval fair: people parade as knights in\nchainmail, as jesters or as paupers, walk in and out of carnival marquees and\nsell each other a variety of handcrafted wares. The aesthetic expectation from\ngoing to a mediaeval fair is not that it accurately resembles mediaeval\nEurope\u2014the aesthetics of which we can only comprehend in terms of an imaginary\noften based on stereotypes and mythology\u2014but that it resembles every other\nmediaeval fair you\u2019ve been to. Nevertheless, LARPing, like any simulation,\nalways requires interfacing with the real at some point. At the mediaeval\nfair, LARPers will don capes and joust with wooden poles. The jousting might\nbelong to the world of images, but the physical consequences of such actions\ncan be very real.\n\nIf we consider through this lens the reworked Marxian adage central to this\nessay, \u2018LARP comes after farce\u2019, we can infer two things. Firstly, we\nunderstand that the political agitation within its scope exists as a\nrepetition and emulation of a prior political agitation. We can consider\nrepetition to be analogous to mimicry, re-enactment, or copy. Secondly, we can\ninfer that it describes a political agitation situated in the world of images.\nThe repetition of an event is a two-fold operation; it operates materially via\nits interface with the real, and it operates symbolically via its interface\nwith the prior iteration of itself \u2013 its referent. For the repetition to be\ndescribed as farcical, its purchase on the real is humorously undermined by\nits failure to convey the gravity of its precedent. However, to describe a\nrepetition as LARP denotes another layer of abstraction; it denotes a\nrepetition which can only ever reproduce its precedent symbolically, and whose\ninterface with the real is experienced as jarring and inadvertent. LARP\nsuggests that this third repetition is no longer situated in the real at all \u2013\nit belongs to an imagined realm of simulation and is made possible by the\nsocial condition of hyperreality.\n\nHyperreality for Baudrillard describes the condition of late modernity where\nsimulacra have become so pervasive in our everyday experience that the\nboundary between image and reality has become pointless to distinguish.\nWithout a clear distinction between the real and the imaginary, simulations\nseem to be able to convey more meaning than the banal real itself \u2013 the\nsimulation is truer than reality, more pressing, more acute. The subjective\nexperience of the hyperreal world requires an implicit understanding of the\nevocative, connotative, and affective functions of the phenomena we interact\nwith, and that this implicit understanding is shared by the people around us.\nIn the hyperreal world, images become vernacular and communicative, and self-\nidentity becomes something you perform by publicly and deliberately\naffiliating with certain images and adopting certain aesthetic signifiers.\nPerformativity \u2013 a concept Judith Butler uses to describe gender identity as\nan \u201cappearance of substance\u201d for a mundane social audience \u2013 is the default\nmode of engagement with the hyperreal world. It is not merely gender that is\nconstructed by images, but all aspects of identity.\n\nIf navigating hyperreality means inevitably performing and signalling your\nidentity with your aesthetic and behavioural decisions, it might seem,\ntherefore, that LARP can be explained as synonymous to performativity. This is\nnot the case; the utility of the term LARP is more specific, especially\ntowards describing political phenomena. One might performatively demonstrate\ntheir gender identity, wealth status, or political allegiance, but to LARP as\nany of these things requires an admission that what one LARPs as is not\nfundamentally connected to their self-identity. Like the knights, jesters, and\npaupers at the mediaeval fair, these identities stop existing as soon as the\nLARPer takes off the costume \u2013 the eBay-bought camo uniform, the Che Guevara\nberet, the bespoke AR-15, the Hawaiian shirt. Indeed, this is precisely how\nLARP is used in the phrase \u2018LARP comes after farce\u2019. LARP politics are\npolitics with low stakes buy-in that one can put on like a costume, just to\nsee if it fits. LARP politics are politics which are not fundamentally\nconnected to self-identity because of an underlying belief that they aren\u2019t\nreal and can\u2019t affect change. Furthermore, LARPing, as a phenomenon belonging\nto Baudrillard\u2019s third order of the image, serves to reinforce the otherwise\nporous boundary between image and reality. As a mode of engagement in\nhyperreality, LARPing is a simulation that masks the absence of the real. To\ndeclare that something is LARP is to uphold the position that the boundary\nbetween image and reality still exists. This provides a helpful clue towards\nunderstanding the aesthetics of LARP politics.\n\nHyperreality describes an ambiguity between image and reality. However, the\ndialectic between the two still remains culturally understood, and some things\nare perceived to belong to one camp over the other. I argue that in the\nhyperreal world of the 21^st century, \u2018image\u2019 and \u2018reality\u2019 have become\nanalogues to \u2018online\u2019 and \u2018offline\u2019. We have other synonyms that reinforce\nthis dialectic such as \u2018virtual reality\u2019, \u2018metaverse\u2019, and \u2018cyberspace\u2019,\ncompared to \u2018IRL\u2019, \u2018meatspace\u2019, and \u2018physical\u2019. Online phenomena are regarded\nas belonging to the order of the image by virtue of requiring screens to\ninteract with them. Offline phenomena are regarded as belonging to the order\nof the real as interactions with them are physical and tactile. Of course,\nthis distinction is artificial; much of the work done by affect theorists over\nthe past thirty years demonstrates how interactions with images can elicit\nvisceral and palpable physiological responses. Additionally, and of course,\ncentral to Baudrillard\u2019s notion of hyperreality, our experience of the offline\nworld is also understood via the mediation of images.\n\nMuch like the distinction between LARP and reality, the cultural distinction\nbetween online and offline is also a function of hyperreality that masks the\nabsence of the real. As described earlier in this piece, the political context\nof the 21^st century is that politics are structured and understood according\nto their aesthetic features and affective value. For politics to be adopted\nas, and reduced to, personal style makes sense in the hyperreal world: the\npolitical subject is a consumer of images. LARP politics, in addition to\ndescribing a political engagement that can be turned on and off like a tap,\ndescribes an aesthetic quality of belonging to the internet. Because the\nonline image-world is resolutely understood in opposition to the offline real-\nworld, LARP politics are regarded as bizarre and out of place when they\nrupture into the real. Like any simulation, though, a rupture into the real is\ninevitable, and I argue is vital for the emergence of the declaration \u2018LARP\ncomes after farce\u2019.\n\n####\n\nRuptures into the Real\n\nBaudrillard states that when simulation confronts power, any distinction\nbetween simulation and reality becomes useless to distinguish. His analogy of\nthe simulated robbery describes this clash between simulation and reality\nsuccinctly:\n\n\u201cSimulate a robbery in a large store: how to persuade security that it is a\nsimulated robbery? There is no \u2018objective\u2019 difference: the gestures, the signs\nare the same as for a real robbery, the signs do not lean to one side or\nanother. To the established order they are always of the order of the real.\u201d\n\nThe simulated robbery example precisely demonstrates the tension between\nhyperreality and reality that I argue is central to our understanding of the\nabsurdity of LARP politics. Like a fourth-wall break, the order of the image\nintrudes into the order of the real and this tension becomes ruptured.\nRuptures from hyperreal simulation into the real are experienced palpably by a\nsociety who would otherwise maintain the cognitive distinction between \u2018image\u2019\nand \u2018reality\u2019. These ruptures often become historically or culturally\nsignificant events whose consequences vary from grave and traumatic to amusing\nand idiosyncratic. In each case, these ruptures for most people are\ndisorienting, baffling and hard to understand on their face value. To\ndemonstrate what I mean when I talk about ruptures, I will return to the\nexample of the Capitol Hill riot, where political rhetoric born from the order\nof images confronts power which can only function in the order of the real.\n\nIf we consider the Capitol Hill riot within this framework, actions based\nlargely in an \u2018alternate reality\u2019 with distinctly online aesthetics were\ninevitably met with real and grave material consequences: over a hundred\npeople were injured, five people died, property was damaged, arrests were\nmade, and the event became considered a pivotal moment in contemporary\nAmerican political history. At the same time, the political goals of the riot\nwere unclear (if they existed at all) and the aesthetics found within the riot\nbecame infamous for their overall weirdness. The aesthetic weirdness attached\nto this event is now widely understood; the QAnon Shaman\u2019s appearance, the\ntypically left-wing fist gesture on display by Senator Josh Hawley, the mass\nof Gadsden flags and Trump 2020 campaign flags, and the gallows paraded\ntowards the building have all become iconic images sitting uncomfortably in\nthe collective psyche of people impacted by US politics.\n\nAn NBC4 news report uploaded to YouTube detailing FBI custody over the gallows\nparaded at the Capitol Hill riot.\n\nThe gallows specifically provided an uncanny resemblance to Baudrillard\u2019s\nrobbery example and encapsulated much of what LARP politics describes. As an\nobject whose utilitarian function is to hang someone, it was too structurally\nunsound to fulfill this role. Instead, ostensibly a theatre prop, it served as\na metonym for the entire mob of rioters whose actions could only ever\nreplicate a political coup in the realm of the imaginary. Additionally, the ad\nhoc and onsite construction of the gallows represents a materialisation of the\nchant to \u201chang Mike Pence,\u201d a chant which could largely be thrown around\nonline and surprise nobody but becomes treated with much more gravity when it\nruptures into the physical world. As such, the confrontation between\nsimulation and power occurs when the construction of the gallows became the\ncause for a police investigation. If the police were to discover who was\nresponsible for its creation\u2014much like in the example of the simulated\nrobbery\u2014how could any defendant claim that the gallows weren\u2019t in fact real?\nMessham-Muir and \u010cvoro also contextualise the Capitol Hill riot as \u201cdelegated\nperformance\u201d art, experimentally attributing to Trump himself authorship over\nthe event and to each of the participants the role of performer. For Messham-\nMuir and \u010cvoro, it is the performers\u2019 unpredictability and, I might add,\nruptures into the real, which provide the aesthetic event an aura of realism.\nThe sense that the Capitol Hill riot can, and ought to, be considered art\nhistorically, alongside the attribution to it \u2018LARP politics\u2019, serve to\nreinforce a boundary between image and reality which is becoming increasingly\ndifficult to maintain.\n\nThe phrase \u2018LARP comes after farce\u2019 has emerged as a compelling addendum to\nthe Marxian adage, describing the sense that 21^st century politics is itching\nfor agitation and revolution but is fundamentally incapable of doing so. The\nimpotence of the politics described as \u2018LARP\u2019 stems from its location within\nthe order of the image at the expense of genuine conviction and organisation\ntowards material change. The Capitol Hill riot provides an almost perfect case\nstudy of LARP politics and hyperreality, but it\u2019s certainly not the only\nexample. As a phenomenon which can be described according to Baudrillard\u2019s\nnotion of simulation, LARP politics inevitably face the real at some point,\nand their clashes with the real will leave many scratching their heads.\n\n8 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n4 Restacks\n\n8\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Paul Sutherland: LARP Politics and Hyperreality\n\ndonotresearch.substack.com\n\n1\n\nShare\n\n1 Comment\n\nCraig Carpenter IIProsaic8 hrs agoBest characterization of Jan. 6 I\u2019ve\nseenExpand full commentLike (2)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nTwee Whistler: Internet Core\n\nTwee Whistler While writing this report I\u2019ve exchanged literally-a-couple\ntexts with artist Katja Novitskova, with whom I share the same annoyance...\n\nJul 31, 2023 \u2022\n\nDo Not Research\n\n47\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Twee Whistler: Internet Core\n\ndonotresearch.substack.com\n\n1\n\nBrad Abrahams: Neural Deceleration\n\nBrad Abrahams (IG) (X) \u201cI came here to add commas and stab people, and I\u2019m all\nout of commas.\u201d - Joseph Cantrell In my practice as a documentarian, I...\n\nFeb 26 \u2022\n\nDo Not Research\n\n30\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Brad Abrahams: Neural Deceleration\n\ndonotresearch.substack.com\n\n2\n\nAimee Walleston: War Lore\n\nAimee Walleston (IG) (X) I watched the trailer for the upcoming film by Alex\nGarland titled Civil War when it came out in mid-December (the film will be...\n\nApr 15 \u2022\n\nDo Not Research\n\n22\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Aimee Walleston: War Lore\n\ndonotresearch.substack.com\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Do Not Research\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
