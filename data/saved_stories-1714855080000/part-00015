The trial\nis over and closing arguments are under way.\n\nSpencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nThe landmark monopoly trial between the U.S. Justice Department and Google\ncomes to a finale this week. After a five-month hiatus, both sides will\npresent closing arguments starting Thursday aiming to persuade the federal\njudge why they should win the case.\n\nThe Justice Department has accused Google of illegally abusing its power as a\nmonopoly to control the search engine business \u2014 leading to competitors being\nsidelined and customers being shortchanged by getting a lower quality\nexperience. Google, for its part, has argued its search engine is simply the\nbest, that's why it's the most popular \u2014 not because of its business dealings.\n\nIt's the first high-profile monopoly case to go to trial among a handful that\nthe U.S. government has brought against tech companies in recent years. The\nU.S. has also sued Amazon, Apple and Facebook parent Meta over business\npractices it says hurts both rivals and consumers.\n\nHow the judge rules in this case could have far-reaching effects on how people\nuse and interact with the internet.\n\n### Technology\n\n### Google Abuses Its Monopoly Power Over Search, Justice Department Says In\nLawsuit\n\n### Business\n\n### The U.S. sues Apple, saying it abuses its power to monopolize the\nsmartphone market\n\nDuring the trial last fall, the two sides battled it out in court over a\n10-week period. Silicon Valley executives, including Google CEO Sundar Pichai\nand Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, testified, while troves of internal documents\nwere introduced. Arguments erupted over redacted evidence, closed-door\ntestimony and alleged destruction of employee chat logs.\n\n\"There's this wider debate about whether the antitrust laws are up to it with\nthe big technological world we live in now,\" says Sam Weinstein, a former\nJustice Department antitrust lawyer who's now a professor at the Cardozo\nSchool of Law. \"And so, this is putting it to the test.\"\n\nThe Justice Department first filed its lawsuit against Google in 2020. A group\nof 35 states, along with Guam, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, filed\na near identical suit at that time. Both suits were heard by Judge Amit Mehta\nduring the trial, which wrapped up in November.\n\n### Google paid $26.3 billion in 2021 alone to be the default search engine on\nphones and web browsers\n\nThe Justice Department's case hinged on allegations that Google illegally\norchestrated its business dealings with device makers, like Apple and Samsung,\nand web browser companies, like Mozilla, which runs Firefox.\n\nDuring the trial, the government showed that Google paid billions of dollars\nevery year for exclusive agreements with these companies. In 2021, it spent a\ntotal of $26.3 billion to ensure it was the default search engine on phones\nand web browsers, according to witness testimony. Apple, which had the most\nlucrative deal, was paid around $18 billion in 2021, according to the New York\nTimes.\n\n\"Google illegally maintained a monopoly for more than a decade,\" Kenneth\nDintzer, the Justice Department's lead lawyer, said in the trial's opening\nstatements. \"If Google sets the rules, it will always be to their advantage.\"\n\n### Business\n\n### United States takes on Google in biggest tech monopoly trial of 21st\ncentury\n\nGoogle's parent company Alphabet, which is now worth more than $2 trillion,\ncontrols roughly 90% of the U.S. search engine market. For its defense, the\ncompany put together a massive legal team and brought on outside law firms to\nhelp fight its case.\n\nMuch of the company's case centers around its claims that people love Google\nSearch and that's why they use it. And, Google argues, if people want to\nswitch the default search engine on their devices, they can with just a few\nclicks.\n\n\"Users today have more search options and more ways to access information\nonline than ever before,\" Google's lead lawyer John Schmidtlein said during\nthe trial's opening statements.\n\n### Even Microsoft CEO says it couldn't compete with Google\n\nOver the course of the trial, the Justice Department called dozens of\nwitnesses to testify \u2013 including experts, psychologists and top executives\nfrom Apple, Microsoft and Google.\n\nWhen Microsoft CEO Nadella took the stand, he said that he tried for years to\nget Apple to set Microsoft's Bing search engine as the default on iPhones and\niPads. He added, however, that even a company as big as Microsoft couldn't\ncompete.\n\nExecutives from other smaller search engines, like DuckDuckGo and Neeva also\ntestified that Google's exclusive deals closed off their potential to gain\nmarket share. Gabriel Weinberg, DuckDuckGo's CEO, said his privacy-centric\nsearch engine company tried relentlessly to negotiate deals with device makers\nbut it never panned out.\n\n\"We ultimately decided after three years of trying this that it was a quixotic\nexercise because of the contracts,\" Mr. Weinberg testified.\n\n### Business\n\n### Google to present its star witness, the company's CEO, in landmark\nmonopoly trial\n\nGoogle's witnesses mostly included people within the company. When CEO Pichai\ntestified, he said paying billions of dollars to ensure Google Search had\ndefault placement on devices made total sense \u2014 as it would for any business.\n\n\"We want to make it very, very seamless and easy for users to use our\nservice,\" he said.\n\nDuring the trial, Google requested that a lot of the testimony about its\nbusiness dealings be presented behind closed doors. Eddy Cue, Apple's senior\nvice president of services, testified for four hours, but more than half of\nthat was closed to the public. And, throughout the trail, Google repeatedly\nfought to seal documents and shutter proceedings in public court.\n\nIt became so pervasive that The New York Times and other major news\norganizations filed a court motion imploring the judge to ensure the case was\nconducted in an open courtroom.\n\n### The judge will decide if laws from 1800s apply in today's modern world\n\nThe trial was what's known as a bench trial, which means there's no jury and\nJudge Mehta will decide. After closing arguments, he's expected to rule within\nthe coming months.\n\nIf Mehta sides with Google, the company's business practices will likely\nremain the same. If he rules in favor of the Justice Department, it's unclear\nhow he'd sanction Google. It could be anything from fines to a restructuring\nof the company.\n\nClosing arguments are expected to wrap Friday. It's possible some of the\npreviously sealed documents will be made public, bringing forward more\nevidence. The Justice Department and Google are expected to reiterate their\ntop takeaways from trial and answer the judge's questions.\n\nIn a post-trial brief, Google wrote that evidence during the trial proved\n\"Google is the highest quality, most popular search engine.\" While the Justice\nDepartment and states wrote in their post-trial brief that Google \"exploited\nits monopoly power to 'freeze the ecosystem' of what should otherwise be a\nvibrant and competitive industry.\"\n\nWeinstein, the Cardozo law professor, says it will be interesting to see how\nMehta rules and whether the antitrust laws that were created in the late 1800s\ncan still be applied in today's modern world.\n\n\"I think there's some evidence, at least, that they're still applicable and\nthey can still work even though we're past the smokestack age and into the\ndigital age,\" he says.\n\nEditor's note: Google, Apple and Microsoft are among NPR's financial\nsupporters.\n\n  * Google\n  * Apple\n  * Monopoly\n  * Satya Nadella\n  * Department of Justice\n  * antitrust\n  * sundar pichai\n\n###### Read & Listen\n\n  * Home\n  * News\n  * Culture\n  * Music\n  * Podcasts & Shows\n\n###### Connect\n\n  * Newsletters\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * Press\n  * Public Editor\n  * Corrections\n  * Contact & Help\n\n###### About NPR\n\n  * Overview\n  * Diversity\n  * NPR Network\n  * Accessibility\n  * Ethics\n  * Finances\n\n###### Get Involved\n\n  * Support Public Radio\n  * Sponsor NPR\n  * NPR Careers\n  * NPR Shop\n  * NPR Events\n  * NPR Extra\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy\n  * Your Privacy Choices\n  * Text Only\n  * \u00a9 2024 npr\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor\n\n## Cookie Consent & Sponsorship Choices\n\nWe and our 169 partners store and/or access information on a device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies to process personal data.
