I inhale through a snorkel. My eyes are\nclosed. Body relaxed. I raise one finger, motioning to my dive buddy that I am\ntaking my last breath. Finally, after several minutes of floating meditation,\nI am ready.\n\nI exhale all the air I possibly can.\n\nMy chest deflates. An uncomfortable tightness grips.\n\nGrips me.\n\nI take a single breath.\n\nIt is deep and full.\n\nMy chest expands. My stomach too.\n\nI feel it in my throat.\n\nThe author and other divers prepare to descend.\n\nShawnee Turner\n\nWith a splash, I duck-dive, pushing my hips in the air and my head down. I\ngrab the line\u2014a rope that is suspended from a buoy and anchored with weights\nthat drop to the dive depth.\n\nI pull myself deeper.\n\nAs I dive, a wetsuit clings to my body, forming a second skin that allows me\nto stay in the water longer without getting cold. Long fins morph my human\nlegs into a mermaid-like tail. A mask fits tightly to my face, allowing me to\nsee the line in front of me and the blue beyond. A rubber belt sits tightly on\nmy hips. It is threaded with several kilograms of lead weights that help me\nsink, counteracting my body\u2019s buoyancy.\n\nThough I could freedive without any of this gear, it transforms me, allowing\nfor immersion that seems to transcend being human.\n\n\u273d\n\nI began freediving while living on Lord Howe Island, far off the east coast of\nAustralia. This verdant, volcanic island\u2014home to about 400 people\u2014is my\nresearch field site where I am studying human-environment relations. Lord Howe\nand its Marine Park\u2013protected waters are both listed as UNESCO World Heritage\nsites. Within these aquamarine waters lies the world\u2019s southernmost coral\nreef. \u201cThis is our underwater playground,\u201d says Liv Rose, my freediving\nteacher.\n\nLord Howe Island and its surrounding ocean are UNESCO World Heritage listed.\n\nShawnee Turner\n\nBefore coming to Lord Howe, I had heard about freediving, but I thought it was\na dangerous extreme sport I\u2019d never try. That changed when I met Liv. I had\nalways loved being in the ocean, and I took little convincing once I heard her\ntalk about the unique feeling of freediving. Beyond that, I was\nanthropologically fascinated by why people might want to do something that\nseemed so counterintuitive: to hold their breath and fight all instincts to\nbreathe in order to reach a new level of immersion.\n\nOver the course of numerous classes, I absorbed the basics of freediving.\nLying on the floor in Liv\u2019s house, I learned to breathe again. To breathe as a\nfreediver does\u2014fully\u2014and then to hold it until I couldn\u2019t stand it any longer.\nWith an oxygen monitor on my finger, I came to understand that though I felt I\nwould black out any moment, I had \u201cso much time,\u201d as Liv would say in a\ncalming voice.\n\nI developed a new awareness of my body, discovering the parts of my anatomy I\nneeded to control to equalize my ears. I researched people who have used the\ntechniques of freediving for centuries. The Ama\u2014Japanese fisherwomen divers.\nThe Haenyeo\u2014female divers of Jeju, South Korea, who harvest mollusks, seaweed,\nand other foods from the sea while holding their breath.\n\nJapanese fisherwomen called Ama dive for seafood without any breathing\napparatuses.\n\nVICE News/YouTube\n\nI learned about competitive freediving\u2014the sport shown in the 2023 Netflix\ndocumentary The Deepest Breath and described in James Nestor\u2019s book Deep. I\nwondered at the apparent obsession and addiction such freedivers have to get\ndeeper, to push human boundaries.\n\nMy dive buddies and I don\u2019t go to such extreme depths. Rather, we are using\nthe techniques to explore. And what we have found, in a sense, goes even\ndeeper: a new identity and a realization of what it means to be in reciprocity\nwith the sea.\n\n\u273d\n\nI am moving down slowly. At times I close my eyes to relax. There is no rush\nto the bottom.\n\nCompared to scuba divers, who are laden with heavy oxygen tanks and take\nbreaths that reverberate bubbles and noise, I move quietly, freely,\ngracefully. \u201cIt makes you feel like you are from the sea,\u201d Liv says.\n\nAt around 10 meters deep, I reach a point where my buoyancy cancels out. I\nneither sink nor float. Below that, the water starts pulling me down. At these\ndepths, freedivers can enter a free fall.\n\nI descend deeper.\n\nEach meter down, the water pressure increases. It makes my lungs shrink, my\nairways squeeze. With my free hand, I clamp my nostrils together and blow,\nequalizing the pressure in my ears.\n\nI reach the bottom of the line.\n\nThe author\u2019s freediving teacher, Liv Rose, descends into the ocean while\nholding her breath.\n\nShawnee Turner\n\nI\u2019m 20 meters deep.\n\nI turn.\n\nTugging on the rope, I begin my ascent. This is just a taste of the addiction\nto depth. The freediving world record is 214 meters.\n\nWithout breath, carbon dioxide begins to build in my body.\n\nMy diaphragm tightens.\n\nMy ribs convulse.\n\nThese contractions come suddenly. They are my body\u2019s way of telling me I\nshould breathe. I am still meters away from the surface.\n\nI\u2019m running out of air.\n\nI calm these thoughts. I know I can push past this human impulse. I\u2019ve\npracticed on dry land, holding my breath for three minutes. In the mindful\nstate of freediving, I don\u2019t panic. I find stillness. Centeredness. Calm. I am\nbelonging in the moment. I\u2019ve retrained my mind to be underwater.\n\nMy body, meanwhile, is using the mammalian dive response to function. This is\na set of physiological reactions that all mammals have, including humans. It\u2019s\ntriggered by being in water, especially when your face is submerged and you\u2019re\nholding your breath. It slows your heart rate to increase your ability to\npreserve oxygen. (This is one reason it feels calming to splash water on your\nface.) Your body also shifts blood from your hands, feet, arms, and legs to\nyour core, vital organs. This allows freedivers to stay longer in the state of\napnea\u2014meaning \u201cwithout breath.\u201d\n\nLiv ascends from a 20-meter dive \u201con the line.\u201d\n\nSally Montgomery\n\nLiv moves through shafts of light as she rises from a dive near Lord Howe\nIsland.\n\nShawnee Turner\n\nAs I near the surface, the urge to breathe builds. The contractions in my\nstomach become more severe. My dive buddy descends a few meters, meeting me on\nmy return. She watches me for any signs that I might black out\u2014which,\nunderwater, can prove fatal.\n\nWe break the surface with a splash. I cling to the buoy. My dive buddy watches\nme intently. I could still black out. As Liv taught me, I take three\nexaggerated \u201crecovery\u201d breaths\u2014fast inhales and long exhales. I make an \u201cOK\u201d\nsignal to my buddy with my hand, saying the same. I\u2019ve returned to the world\nabove the surface.\n\n\u273d\n\nOne day, exploring underwater while freediving, Shawnee, one of the seasonal\ntourism workers, found an old car tire wedged in the coral reef. She decided\nthat the rubber, which is toxic when it breaks down in the sea, didn\u2019t belong.\nSo she dragged it behind her on the swim back to the beach, then hauled it\nfrom the water for disposal.\n\nLike many young people working seasonally in tourism on Lord Howe Island,\nShawnee regularly bounces between places. I wondered, in my conversations with\nmany of the seasonal workers, What might connect someone who moves so\nfrequently to a sense of belonging?\n\n\u201cUnderwater is where I feel truly accepted, at peace,\u201d Shawnee said. \u201cMaybe\nthat is what home means to me.\u201d\n\nFreediving\u2014like surfing, swimming, and other forms of immersion\u2014gives you the\nfeeling of transcending being human. It dissolves our sense of separateness\nfrom the ocean ecosystem. It brings a feeling of belonging. A sense of what I\ncall a \u201ccitizenship of the sea.\u201d\n\nAround Lord Howe Island, the ocean is filled with underwater caves called\n\u201cswim-throughs\u201d that freedivers explore.\n\nShawnee Turner\n\nShawnee drags a tire from the coral reef fringing Lord Howe Island.\n\nSally Montgomery\n\nThis relationship is transformative. It can translate to a desire to give\nback. Anthropologists call such exchanges of mutual benefit \u201creciprocity.\u201d\n\nSeeing Shawnee pull a tire from the reef and watching many others collect\nbeach-washed plastic or rescue birds who had ingested it, I came to understand\nthese acts as a form of reciprocity between people and the sea. These\ndemonstrations of care simultaneously preserve environments and help ensure\nthat people now and in the future may have the same experiences and\nopportunities to find happiness and belonging underwater.\n\nToday amid a growing rift between humans and nature, it is important to\nunderstand how we belong in environments. How we\u2014humans and other species,\nland, sea, and air\u2014are all interconnected. By exploring new depths of\nimmersion, enjoyment, and kinship in environments\u2014through freediving, hiking,\nor other forms of being in nature\u2014we can forge connections with the natural\nworld and deeper relationships of care.\n\nA sense of reciprocity with nature, above or below the sea, motivates us to\ngive back more than we take. Through freediving, I\u2019ve realized that when\nreciprocity flows from belonging, care is as necessary and natural as the\ndesire to breathe.\n\nSally Montgomery\n\nSally Montgomery is a Ph.D. candidate in social anthropology at the University\nof Cambridge. Originally from Australia, Montgomery focuses on environmental\nanthropology. Her fieldwork research was conducted on Lord Howe Island, a\nsmall island off Australia. Montgomery\u2019s research explores notions of human\nand nonhuman belonging on the island and the historical, ecological, and\npolitical processes that inform these conceptions.\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\n### Stay connected\n\n#### Find us on\n\nFacebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Threads, Twitter, Mastodon, Flipboard\n\n#### Share\n\n, Facebook, Twitter, Email, ,\n\nSuggestions for You\n\ncolumn / Cultural Relativity\n\n### Are Insomniacs Overthinking Sleep?\n\nMatthew Gwynfryn Thomas\n\nFrom WiFi-enabled sleep trackers to wearable brain-altering apps, sleep\ntechnology is becoming increasingly sophisticated.
