They sit in dry, desert\nlandscapes in the Central Valley and are scattered over rooftops in Los\nAngeles\u2019s urban center. By last count, the state had nearly 47 gigawatts of\nsolar power installed \u2014 enough to power 13.9 million homes and provide over a\nquarter of the Golden State\u2019s electricity.\n\nBut now, the state and its grid operator are grappling with a strange reality:\nThere is so much solar on the grid that, on sunny spring days when there\u2019s not\nas much demand, electricity prices go negative. Gigawatts of solar are\n\u201ccurtailed\u201d \u2014 essentially, thrown away.\n\nIn response, California has cut back incentives for rooftop solar and slowed\nthe pace of installing panels. But the diminishing economic returns may slow\nthe development of solar in a state that has tried to move to renewable\nenergy. And as other states build more and more solar plants of their own,\nthey may soon face the same problems.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cThese are not insurmountable challenges,\u201d said Michelle Davis, head of global\nsolar at the energy research and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie Power and\nRenewables. \u201cBut they are challenges that a lot of grid operators have never\nhad to deal with.\u201d\n\nSolar power has many wonderful properties \u2014 once built, it costs almost\nnothing to run; it produces no air pollution and generates energy without\nburning fossil fuels. But it also has one major, obvious drawback: The sun\ndoesn\u2019t shine all the time.\n\nOver 15 years ago, researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory\nwere in the midst of modeling a future with widespread solar power when they\nnoticed something strange. With lots of solar power on a given electricity\ngrid, the net load \u2014 or the demand for electricity minus the renewable energy\n\u2014 would take on a \u201cU\u201d shape. Sky-high demand in the morning would be replaced\nby almost zero demand in the middle of the day, when solar power could\ngenerate virtually all electricity people needed. Then as the sun set, demand\nsurged up again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nCalifornia\u2019s grid operator, known as CAISO, later dubbed this effect the \u201cduck\ncurve.\u201d (If you squint, you can imagine the curve as the belly of a duck.)\nIt\u2019s most prominent in the spring months, when solar panels get plenty of\nsunshine but there is less demand for heating and cooling.\n\nIn recent years in California, the duck curve has become a massive, deep\ncanyon \u2014 and solar power is going unused. In 2022, the state wasted 2.4\nmillion megawatt-hours of electricity, 95 percent of which was solar. (That\u2019s\nroughly 1 percent of the state\u2019s overall power generation in a year, or 5\npercent of its solar generation.) Last year, the state did that in just the\nfirst eight months.\n\nFollow Climate & environment\n\nClyde Loutan, principal for renewable energy integration at CAISO, says that\nthe state has long been prepared for more solar on the grid. But, he added,\n\u201cWe drastically underestimated the speed at which residential solar was going\nto come in.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nCurtailing solar isn\u2019t technically difficult \u2014 according to Paul Denholm,\nsenior research fellow at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, it\u2019s\nequivalent to flipping a switch for grid operators. But throwing away free\npower raises electricity prices.\n\nIt has also undercut the benefits of installing rooftop solar. Since the\n1990s, California has been paying owners of rooftop solar panels when they\nexport their energy to the grid. That meant that rooftop solar owners got\n$0.20 to $0.30 for each kilowatt-hour of electricity that they dispatched.\n\nBut a year ago, the state changed this system, known as \u201cnet-metering,\u201d and\nnow only compensates new solar panel owners for how much their power is worth\nto the grid. In the spring, when the duck curve is deepest, that number can\ndip close to zero. Customers can get more money back if they install batteries\nand provide power to the grid in the early evening or morning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe change has sparked a huge backlash from Californians and rooftop solar\ncompanies, which say that their businesses are flagging. Indeed, Wood\nMackenzie predicts that California residential solar installations in 2024\nwill fall by around 40 percent. Some state politicians are now trying to\nreverse the rule.\n\n\u201cUnder the CPUC\u2019s leadership California is responsible for the largest loss of\nsolar jobs in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d Bernadette del Chiaro, the executive\ndirector of the California Solar and Storage Association, said in a statement\nreferring to California\u2019s public utility commission.\n\nBut experts say that it reflects how the economics of solar are changing in a\nstate that has gone all-in on the technology.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want the utility or the grid operator to be overpaying for power\nwhen they don\u2019t have to,\u201d Davis said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nOther states, which have been slower to adopt solar, are starting to\nexperience the same thing. Nevada, which generates 23 percent of its power\nfrom solar, has also seen deepening duck curves. Hawaii, which has thousands\nof homes with rooftop solar, has cut down on the payments those households get\nfrom the grid.\n\nBeyond the sunny West, many states are still trying to ramp up rooftop solar\npower and extend its reach beyond affluent households. The Biden\nadministration announced $7 billion in grants this week to provide rooftop\nsolar to 900,000 low-income households.\n\nCalifornia grid operators hope that their experience will teach other states\nwhat to expect as renewables grow. \u201cThe problem we\u2019re seeing out West \u2014 nobody\nelse has seen this,\u201d Loutan said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nSolar can still grow in California. In the summer, when high air conditioning\nuse strains the grid, solar can be useful even in the middle of the day.\nDenholm says that as solar continues to drop in price, installing solar that\nis curtailed regularly can still be cost-effective. \u201cThrowing away some amount\nof renewable energy can absolutely make economic sense,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut California\u2019s grid operator still hopes to avoid it if at all possible.\nLoutan called it \u201cone of the last things we want to do.\u201d\n\nTo cope, CAISO is selling some excess power to nearby states; California is\nalso planning to install additional storage and batteries to hold solar power\nuntil later in the afternoon. Transmission lines that can carry electricity to\nnearby regions will also help \u2014 some of the lost power comes from regions\nwhere there simply aren\u2019t enough power lines to carry a sudden burst of solar.\n\nDenholm says the state is starting to take the steps needed to deal with the\nglut. \u201cThere are fundamental limits to how much solar we can put on the grid\nbefore you start needing a lot of storage,\u201d Denholm said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just sit\naround and do nothing.\u201d\n\n### More on climate change\n\nUnderstanding our climate: Global warming is a real phenomenon, and weather\ndisasters are undeniably linked to it. As temperatures rise, heat waves are\nmore often sweeping the globe \u2014 and parts of the world are becoming too hot to\nsurvive.\n\nWhat can be done? The Post is tracking a variety of climate solutions, as well\nas the Biden administration\u2019s actions on environmental issues. It can feel\noverwhelming facing the impacts of climate change, but there are ways to cope\nwith climate anxiety.\n\nInventive solutions: Some people have built off-the-grid homes from trash to\nstand up to a changing climate. As seas rise, others are exploring how to\nharness marine energy.\n\nWhat about your role in climate change? Our climate coach Michael J.
