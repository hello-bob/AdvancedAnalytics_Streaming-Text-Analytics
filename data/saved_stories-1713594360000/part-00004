To conduct root cause analysis (RCA) and\n> resolution of alert events, we propose a pioneering framework, multi-Agent\n> Blockchain-inspired Collaboration for root cause analysis in micro-services\n> architecture (mABC), to revolutionize the AI for IT operations (AIOps)\n> domain, where multiple agents based on the powerful large language models\n> (LLMs) perform blockchain-inspired voting to reach a final agreement\n> following a standardized process for processing tasks and queries provided\n> by Agent Workflow. Specifically, seven specialized agents derived from Agent\n> Workflow each provide valuable insights towards root cause analysis based on\n> their expertise and the intrinsic software knowledge of LLMs collaborating\n> within a decentralized chain. To avoid potential instability issues in LLMs\n> and fully leverage the transparent and egalitarian advantages inherent in a\n> decentralized structure, mABC adopts a decision-making process inspired by\n> blockchain governance principles while considering the contribution index\n> and expertise index of each agent. Experimental results on the public\n> benchmark AIOps challenge dataset and our created train-ticket dataset\n> demonstrate superior performance in accurately identifying root causes and\n> formulating effective solutions, compared to previous strong baselines. The\n> ablation study further highlights the significance of each component within\n> mABC, with Agent Workflow, multi-agent, and blockchain-inspired voting being\n> crucial for achieving optimal performance. mABC offers a comprehensive\n> automated root cause analysis and resolution in micro-services architecture\n> and achieves a significant improvement in the AIOps domain compared to\n> existing baselines\n\nSubjects:| Multiagent Systems (cs.MA); Cryptography and Security (cs.CR);\nDistributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.12135 [cs.MA]  \n(or arXiv:2404.12135v1 [cs.MA] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.12135arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Wei Zhang [view email] [v1] Thu, 18 Apr 2024 12:35:39 UTC (30,262 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled mABC: multi-Agent Blockchain-Inspired\nCollaboration for root cause analysis in micro-services architecture, by Wei\nZhang and 14 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.MA\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.CR cs.DC\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
