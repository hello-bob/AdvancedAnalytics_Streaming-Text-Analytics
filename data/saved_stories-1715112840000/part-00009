It can support all these protocols\nconcurrently.\n\nThis is an Open Source project with an active community of both company\nsponsored and independent developers. This Wiki is the primary location for\nall current information about the project and its software releases.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n    * pNFS\n    * Release Status\n    * Source Code Availability\n    * Development Policies\n    * Documentation\n    * Developer Documentation\n    * Contacting Us\n    * Other Useful Links\n\n  \n---  \n  \n## pNFS\n\nNFS-Ganesha has support infrastructure for pNFS but efforts in this area have\nnot been active for many years and pNFS is not currently supported by the\nactive community.\n\n## Release Status\n\nReleases occur more often than updates to this section. To get the most up to\ndate release information, browse the NFS-Ganesha GitHub Releases history.\n\nVersion 5.7 is the current supported release. Release Notes\n\nUsers of the following older releases are urged to upgrade as we are unable to\ndevote resources to fix issues with these releases. There are no collated\nrelease notes for most of these older releases, the tag information for the\nlatest update for each is listed, if you really need the full release history,\nalso explore the tags from V3.0 to V3.4 or V2.x.0 to V2.x.y).\n\nThe last Version 4 release is 4.4.1. Release Notes\n\nThe last Version 3 release is 3.5.\n\nThe last Version 2.8 release is 2.8.4.\n\nThe last 2.7 release is 2.7.6.\n\nThe last 2.6 release is 2.6.3.\n\nThe last 2.5 release is 2.5.5.\n\nThe last 2.4 release is 2.4.5.\n\nThe last 2.3 release was 2.3.3.\n\nThe last 2.2 release was Version 2.2. This is a significant update that\nsupports delegations. It also improves stability and protocol correctness. See\nthe Release Notes V2.2 for details.\n\nOur previous releases are Version 2.1 (see the Release Notes V2.1 for\ndetails), Version 2.0 (see the Release Notes V2.0 for details) and Version 1.5\n\n## Source Code Availability\n\nOur supported releases since 2.3 are available as source code tarball\ndownloads provided via the Release Status history URL above. Git provides\naccess to the most recent development or (if you select) stable branches at\nGithub nfs-ganesha.\n\nSee the Download Page for details. Official tarballs are also available by\nclicking through the Releases button on the repository's top page.\n\nWe (obviously) use git for our source management. Our official development\ntree is maintained at Github nfs-ganesha. Individual developers have their own\ngit repositories, most of them on Github, for publishing their changes to the\ncommunity. See the Developer Area for details. The Release Notes describe\nsource availability in greater detail. In particular, all our releases going\nforward are marked by signed tags.\n\nNOTE:\n\n    The sidebar on the repository's home page gives you the choice of an HTTPS or SSH for cloning. We use git submodules which will not work with an HTTPS clone. Use: git clone git://github.com/nfs-ganesha/nfs-ganesha.git instead for anonymous clones.\n\n## Development Policies\n\nAs our user base and development community have expanded, we have had to put\nsome order to how we develop, release, and support our work. Our Development\nPolicies page describes how we go about our business, developing Open Source\nsoftware.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation from the \"next\" branch: https://github.com/nfs-ganesha/nfs-\nganesha/tree/next/src/doc/man\n\nFrom V3-stable: https://github.com/nfs-ganesha/nfs-\nganesha/tree/V3-stable/src/doc/man\n\nSome documentation on setting up NFS-Ganesha: Setup\n\n## Developer Documentation\n\nCompiling: https://github.com/nfs-ganesha/nfs-\nganesha/blob/next/src/COMPILING_HOWTO.txt\n\nContributing: https://github.com/nfs-ganesha/nfs-\nganesha/blob/next/src/CONTRIBUTING_HOWTO.txt\n\nSome notes on coding style: https://github.com/nfs-ganesha/nfs-\nganesha/blob/next/src/doc/coding_style/doxygen.txt\n\nNote that we follow many of the Linux Kernel style requirements, using\ncheckpatch.pl to verify style. Patch submissions are generally expected to\nconform to the style. There are a few places we make exceptions. Continuous\nIntegration will run checkpatch.pl on your submissions and they will be\nreported. Any exceptions will be noted during code review, otherwise we expect\nthese errors and warnings to be cleaned up.\n\nInstall git hook to run checkpatch.pl: https://github.com/nfs-ganesha/nfs-\nganesha/blob/next/src/scripts/git_hooks/install_git_hooks.sh\n\nThe checkpatch.pl script: https://github.com/nfs-ganesha/nfs-\nganesha/blob/next/src/scripts/checkpatch.pl\n\n## Contacting Us\n\nThe community maintains an active, open IRC channel on Libera #ganesha. Most\nof our developers keep in touch on this channel.\n\nWe also maintain an email list on https://lists.nfs-\nganesha.org/archives/list/devel@lists.nfs-ganesha.org/. Release announcements,\ntechnical discussions, and user questions are handled here.\n\nWe have a weekly 30 minute video conference call on Tuesdays at 7:00 AM\nPST/PDT on Google Meet:\n\n    \n    \n    https://meet.google.com/mkh-ctnj-tqz phone (US) +1 401-702-0462 (PIN: 495972631) other phone numbers at https://meet.google.com/mkh-ctnj-tqz\n\n## Other Useful Links\n\n  * NFS-Ganesha devel mailing list\n  * NFS-GANESHA's support mailing-list\n  * Network File System (NFS) version 4 Protocol\n  * Network File System (NFS) Version 4 Minor Version 1 Protocol\n  * Network File System (NFS) Version 4 Minor Version 2 Protocol\n\nThese links are approaching obsolete but may be of interest.\n\n  * Sourceforge project's page\n  * Article about NFS-GANESHA on linux.com\n  * NFS-GANESHA GitWeb (hosted by SourceForge)\n\nAdd a custom footer\n\n  1.
