Special plays. Special players.\n\nBy Tim Marcin on April 12, 2024\n\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Flipboard\n\nSketch is everywhere right now. Credit: Screenshots: TikTok: @thesketchreal /\n@streamerclips091 /@sketchjynx\n\nIf you're into sports, you've likely heard \"What's up, brother?\" on your feed.\nAnd you might've heard it from one of your favorite athletes, like Luka\nDoncic, or a middle-aged GM of the Tampa Bay Bucs.\n\nYou'd be forgiven if you have zero idea what's going on with that. TL;DR: It's\nreferencing a streamer named Sketch, who has become wildly popular in sports.\nHe's a video game streamer with a very specific style \u2014 an alter ego, really \u2014\nand a bevy of catchphrases, like the aforementioned, \"What's up, brother.\"\nHe's taken off online and now seems like a Big Deal as his career grows.\n\nHere are the basics and the background of Sketch.\n\n## Who is Sketch?\n\nI'm not a huge consumer of streamers, so I first came across Sketch \u2014 real\nname Kylie Cox, age around 25 or so \u2014 via TikTok.\n\nHe has a distinct look and voice. Typically speaking, he's wearing a Houston\nTexans jersey, over-ear headphones, glasses, and sporting a buzzcut. His\nTwitch page, thesketchreal, has more than 700K followers as of Friday. He's\nbigger on TikTok with over 1.6 million followers. Each of his videos racks up\nmillions of views. You'll often see him streaming live to TikTok, playing the\nNFL game Madden.\n\nSince blowing up he's been all over: popular podcasts, celebrity streams, the\nwhole bit. He's also gotten the TikTok treatment, where fans clip and repost\njust about everything he does.\n\nSEE ALSO: Jersey Jerry's 36-hour hole-in-one golf livestream is captivating,\nSisyphean entertainment\n\n## Why is he popular?\n\nIn short, he's popular because he's pretty entertaining. Frankly, I'm not\nclear how good he is at games. I'm not a huge gamer so it's difficult to\njudge. But that's not why people tune in and share his clips. It's more his\npersonality and persona. He's both over the top \u2014 yelling, cursing, screaming\nfootball-speak play-calls at his virtual players \u2014 while keeping a monotone,\nhigh-pitched speaking voice. It's a strange brew of jock, nerdy quips, and\nback-of-the-classroom clownery. He's also quick-witted in a nervous way and\nhas developed a specific language of sorts.\n\nMashable Top Stories\n\nStay connected with the hottest stories of the day and the latest\nentertainment news.\n\nSign up for Mashable's Top Stories newsletter\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\n\nThanks for signing up!\n\nHere are a few of his catchphrases:\n\n  * \"What's up, brother?\" \u2014 a greeting typically said in a high voice and with a number one in the air\n\n  * \"Special teams. Special plays. Special players.\" \u2014 complimenting his virtual team\n\n  * \"Tuesday! Tuesday!\" \u2014 that's football speak for tempo, telling his players to hurry up\n\n  * [Janky bird-esque flapping] \u2014 a random thing he does while \"play-calling\"\n\n  * \"Sorry for cussing.\" \u2014 he says this one a lot because he tends to cuss\n\nHe's popular because he's particular. He squints and gesticulates and\ntwitches. You see Sketch, you remember him. Looking through clips, he's also\npopular because he says some out-of-pocket stuff. Crassness works, especially\nonline.\n\n## Who is he popular with?\n\nSketch has gotten super popular and, for lack of a better term, has gone\nmainstream in the men's sporting world. There was a trend on TikTok where one\npartner, typically a woman, would say to the other, typically a man, \"What's\nup, brother?\" Lots of men would respond in a Sketch voice, \"What's up,\nbrother!\"\n\nThat trend has been adopted by tons of pro sports teams and players, such as\nthe Dallas Mavericks, Tennessee Titans, the Final Four teams in March Madness,\nthe NFL, and countless others.\n\nRelated Stories\n\n  * The NFL isn't smart enough to rig games for Taylor Swift\n  * The Super Bowl almost beat the moon landing's watch numbers\n  * Netflix is finally rolling out video game streaming\n  * Little boy names every player on his favourite football team without hesitation\n  * Streamers rejoice: TikTok Live is now integrated with Streamlabs\n\nThere was yet another trend that began with Sketch telling fellow streamer\nJynxi that he had motion \"since birf.\"\n\nAthletes like Bryce Harper have celebrated like Sketch, and he's been\nreferenced in the opening of SportsCenter. Sketch is filming videos playing\nreal football with the IRL Houston Texans.\n\nIn short, this kid has taken over the sports internet. So much so that actual\nathletes are referencing him just about every day. We'll see if Sketch can\nturn his virality into a long-term streaming career.\n\nBut right now he's about as big as it gets in the streaming world. That's\nwhat's up, brother.\n\nTopics TikTok Twitch Sports\n\nTim Marcin\n\nTim Marcin is a culture reporter at Mashable, where he writes about food,\nfitness, weird stuff on the internet, and, well, just about anything else.
