They discovered the gold on a cargo plane\nscheduled to leave for Japan, and officials now say the value of the seizure\nmakes it the biggest gold smuggling case in Hong Kong\u2019s history. What makes\nthis case especially interesting, though, is that Business Insider reports the\ngold was disguised as machine parts.\n\n#### Related Content\n\nGoat Viscera Seized At Chicago O\u2019Hare\n\nHere's How To Import A Japanese Car To America Without Making Your Head\nExplode\n\nThe Honda Passport Is A Reliable Family Crossover | WCSYB?\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nview video\n\nThe Honda Passport Shines As A Family-Friendly Crossover | WCSYB?\n\nOn March 27, customs officials x-rayed two air compressors and discovered that\nthey contained gold that had been \u201cconcealed in the integral parts\u201d of the\ncompressors. Those gold parts had also been painted silver to match the other\ncomponents in an attempt to throw customs off the trail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nGoat Viscera Seized At Chicago O\u2019Hare\n\nHere's How To Import A Japanese Car To America Without Making Your Head\nExplode\n\nThe Honda Passport Is A Reliable Family Crossover | WCSYB?\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nThe Honda Passport Shines As A Family-Friendly Crossover | WCSYB?\n\nPhoto: Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department\n\nAdvertisement\n\nActing Senior Superintendent Jason Lau Yuk-lung told the South China Morning\nPost that this was the first time customs officials had ever discovered gold\ndisguised in this way. Authorities reportedly believe the smuggler went to the\nlengths he did in an effort to avoid Japan\u2019s 10-percent import tariff.\n\u201cSmugglers could have evaded about HK$8.4 million ($1 million) in taxes if the\nprecious metal was successfully smuggled into the country,\u201d Lau told the SCMP.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement, the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department said it had\narrested a 31-year-old man they believe was behind the cleverly concealed gold\nthey seized. He has since been released on bail while authorities continue\ntheir investigation. They did not release his name, but according to Lau, he\nwas the director of a company in Hong Kong that may actually be a shell\ncompany. If convicted, the man faces a maximum prison sentence of seven years\nand a fine of up to HK$2 million or about $255,000 in U.S. dollars.\n\nObviously, smuggling is wrong, but dang, you do have to respect the outside-\nthe-box thinking here. That\u2019s some serious commitment to avoiding import\ntariffs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "frontpage": true}
