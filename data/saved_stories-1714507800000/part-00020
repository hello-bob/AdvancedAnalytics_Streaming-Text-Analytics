So do 1 billion people.\n\nCarl Court / Getty Images\n\nKate Yoder Staff Writer\n\nPublished\n\n    Apr 29, 2024\n\nTopic\n\n    Climate + Science\n\nShare/Republish\n\n    \n\nCopy Link Republish\n\nCopy Link Email SMS Twitter Facebook\n\nRepublish Reddit LinkedIn\n\nAbout a year ago, the seas got unusually hot, even by our current, overheated\nstandards. Twelve months of broken records later, the oceans are still more\nfeverish than climate models and normal fluctuations in global weather\npatterns can explain.\n\nWhen the seas turn into bathwater, it threatens the survival of the planet\u2019s\ncoral reefs, home to a quarter of all marine life and a source of sustenance\nfor many people living along the world\u2019s coasts. Mostly clustered in the\nshallow waters of the tropics, coral reefs have one of the lowest thresholds\nfor rising temperatures of all the possible \u201ctipping points,\u201d the cascading\nfeedback loops that set off large, abrupt changes in the ecosystems, weather\npatterns, and ice formations on Earth. Stable, existing systems wind up in\nnew, completely different states: The lush Amazon rainforest, for example,\nmight collapse into a grassy savanna. Coral reefs might transform into\nseaweed-smothered graveyards.\n\nEarlier this month, the world officially entered its fourth \u2014 and probably\nworst \u2014 mass coral bleaching event in history, according to the National\nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the International Coral Reef\nInitiative. Hot water causes corals to expel the tiny algae that live in their\ntissues, which provide them with food (through photosynthesis) and also a\nrainbow of pigments. Separated from their algae, corals \u201cbleach,\u201d turning\nghostly white, and start to starve.\n\nThe Florida Keys, where water temperatures veered into hot-tub territory last\nyear, saw its most severe bleaching event to date, with scientists\n\u201cevacuating\u201d thousands of corals to tanks on land. In Australia, the iconic\nGreat Barrier Reef is also facing its biggest test yet. In the Indian Ocean,\neven coral species known to be resistant to hot temperatures are bleaching.\n\nGrist thanks its sponsors.

Here's How\n\n\u201cThis is one of the key living systems that we thought was closest to a\ntipping point,\u201d said Tim Lenton, a professor of climate change and Earth\nsystems at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom. \u201cThis is sort of\nhorrible confirmation that it is.\u201d\n\nAn estimated 1 billion people around the world benefit from coral reefs, which\nprovide food and income, while also protecting coastal property from storms\nand flooding. The benefits add up to about $11 trillion a year. With some\nscientists worried that coral reefs may have already passed a point of no\nreturn, researchers are turning to desperate measures to save them, from\nbuilding artificial reefs to attempts to cool down reefs through\ngeoengineering.\n\nLast year, the warmer weather pattern known as El Ni\u00f1o took hold of the globe,\ntemporarily pushing global average temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7\ndegrees Fahrenheit) of warming over pre-industrial times. That\u2019s precisely the\nlevel at which scientists have predicted that between 70 and 99 percent of\ntropical reefs would disappear. With a cooler La Ni\u00f1a phase on the way this\nsummer, it\u2019s possible that corals will make it through the current bout of hot\nocean temperatures. But each week high temperatures persist, another 1 percent\nof corals are predicted to bleach. By the early 2030s, global temperatures are\non track to pass the 1.5 C threshold for good, compared to around 1.2 C today.\n\nTourists snorkel in the Great Barrier Reef in early April, swimming above\nbleached and dead coral.

Even when reefs do recover,\nthere\u2019s usually a loss of species, said Didier Zoccola, a scientist in Monaco\nwho has studied corals for decades. \u201cYou have winners and losers, and the\nlosers, you don\u2019t know if they are important in the ecosystem,\u201d he said.\n\nGrist thanks its sponsors.

Here's How\n\nFor a coral reef, the tipping point would come when bleaching becomes an\nannual event, according to David Kline, the executive director of the Pacific\nBlue Foundation, a nonprofit working to preserve reefs in Fiji. Species would\ngo extinct, leaving only the most heat-tolerant creatures, the \u201ccockroaches\u201d\nof corals that can survive tough conditions. Seaweed would start taking over.\nParts of the world may be approaching this point, if not already past it: The\nGreat Barrier Reef, for example, has gone through five mass bleaching events\nin the last eight years, leaving little chance for recovery. Florida has\nalready lost more than 90 percent of its coral reefs.\n\n\u201cI think most scientists, myself included, would be very uncomfortable saying\nwe\u2019ve reached a tipping point,\u201d said Deborah Brosnan, a longtime coral\nscientist who founded the reef restoration project OceanShot. \u201cBut in reality,\nare we very close to a tipping point? I believe we are, just judging by the\nscale of the bleaching that we\u2019re seeing.\u201d\n\nReefs around the world have already declined by half since the 1950s because\nof climate change, overfishing, and pollution. Some scientists argue that the\nworld may have already passed the point of no return for corals long ago, as\nfar back as the 1980s, yet there\u2019s no consensus. \u201cIf we really want to have\nhealthy, diverse coral reefs in the future, we need to do something about our\ngreenhouse gas emissions, like, right now,\u201d Kline said.\n\nRising temperatures might have already set off other notable tipping points,\nsuch as the accelerated melting of the Greenland ice sheet and the thawing of\nthe northern permafrost, which threatens to release vast amounts of methane, a\npotent greenhouse gas. Coral tipping points would unfold on a regional level,\nwith giant blobs of hot ocean water wrecking reefs, what Lenton characterizes\nas a \u201cclustered\u201d tipping point.\n\nThe 7 climate tipping points that could change the world forever\n\nAlexandria Herr, Shannon Osaka, & Maddie Stone\n\nCoral reefs are so vulnerable, in part, because their existence is fragile in\nthe first palace. Reefs are \u201ca verdant explosion of life in a nutrient\ndesert,\u201d Lenton said, only able to exist because of \u201creally strong reinforcing\nfeedback loops within the system.\u201d An intricate web of corals, algae, sponges,\nand microbes move essential nutrients like nitrogen around, leading to a\nprofusion of life. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that if you push it too hard, or knock\ncertain things out, you can tip it into a different \u2018no coral\u2019 state, or maybe\nseveral different states.\u201d\n\nLosing corals could lead to consequences you wouldn\u2019t expect. For example, you\ncan thank corals for the sand on many beaches \u2014 they help create it (coral\nskeletons turn into sand) and protect beaches from erosion, with the structure\nof the reef calming waves before they reach shore. Reefs contribute to medical\nbreakthroughs \u2014 organisms found in them produce compounds used to treat\ncardiovascular disease and some types of cancer.\n\nResearchers are racing to salvage what\u2019s left of corals and the ecosystems\nthey support. A restoration project in the Caribbean that Brosnan founded,\ncalled OceanShot, is building artificial reefs where natural ones have\ncollapsed. The tiered structures provide habitat for creatures that live in\nthe reefs, both the larger species that live on top and the smaller ones that\nlike to hide in crevices lower down. The installations have had good results,\nwith dozens of fish species moving in, alongside invertebrates like lobsters.\nEven finicky black urchins transplanted on the reef decided to stay. Brosnan\u2019s\nteam is also hoping to deploy them in places where beaches are being lost,\nsince the artificial reefs can also help prevent sand from washing away.\n\nSome preservation attempts are pretty out there. Scientists with the\nSmithsonian\u2019s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute in Washington,\nD.C., for example, are working on deep-freezing coral sperm and larvae through\n\u201ccryopreservation,\u201d Futurama-style, hoping that they can repopulate oceans of\nthe future. In the Great Barrier Reef, researchers have experimented with\nbrightening clouds with sea salt, a form of geoengineering, to try to protect\ncorals from the hot sun.\n\nElsewhere, laboratories are breeding corals to withstand heat and ocean\nacidification. Zoccola works on one such project in Monaco, where scientists\nare using \u201cassisted evolution\u201d to speed up nature\u2019s process, since corals\ncan\u2019t adapt fast enough in the wild. He calls it a \u201cNoah\u2019s Ark\u201d for corals,\nhoping that species can live in the lab until, one day, they\u2019re ready to\nreturn to the ocean.\n\nA message from\n\n#### All donations DOUBLED!\n\nGrist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable\nsolutions to climate change.
