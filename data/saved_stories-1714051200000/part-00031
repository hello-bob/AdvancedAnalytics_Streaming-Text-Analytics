The scrolls recovered\nfrom Herculaneum alongside the ruins of Pompeii following the devastating\neruption of Mount Vesuvius in CE 79, provide invaluable understanding into his\nlife and legacy.\n\nUtilizing innovative methodologies under the \u2018GreekSchools\u2019 project, funded by\nthe ERC (European Research Council), scholars have made remarkable progress in\ndeciphering these ancient texts. Employing advanced imaging techniques such as\ninfrared, ultraviolet optical imaging, thermal imaging, tomography, and\ndigital optical microscopy, researchers have managed to extract over 1000\nwords, approximately 30% of the scrolls.\n\nPlato from Raphael\u2019s The School of Athens (1509 \u2013 1511). Credit: Wikipedia\n\nAccording to Graziano Ranocchia, the lead researcher on the project, the newly\nrevealed details pinpoint Plato\u2019s burial place to a private garden within the\nPlatonic Academy in Athens, near the sacred Museion. This revelation\nchallenges previous speculations regarding the philosopher\u2019s final resting\nplace, offering a more precise location within the Academy grounds.\n\n### RelatedStories\n\n### Researchers use AI to read scrolls buried by Vesuvius eruption\n\nFebruary 6, 2024\n\n### A 21-year-old student successfully deciphered the first word from the\nHerculaneum scrolls, charred during Mount Vesuvius\u2019 eruption\n\nOctober 31, 2023\n\nFurthermore, the scrolls suggest a tumultuous chapter in Plato\u2019s life,\nindicating that he was sold into slavery following the Spartan conquest of the\nisland of Aegina, possibly between 404 BCE and 399 BCE. This revelation adds a\npoignant dimension to Plato\u2019s journey.\n\nAncient road from Kerameikos to Plato\u2019s Academy.

Through the new edition and its contextualization, scholars have\narrived at unexpected interdisciplinary deductions for ancient philosophy,\nGreek biography and literature, and the history of the book,\u201d Ranocchia said.\n\nThe \u2018GreekSchools\u2019 project, a collaborative endeavor involving the University\nof Pisa, the National Research Council, and other research institutions, aims\nto publish an updated edition of Philodemus\u2019 Review of the Philosophers,\nincorporating the newly discovered texts.\n\nShare54Tweet34Share9ShareSendShare\n\n### You May Also Like...\n\nArchaeology\n\n### Archaeologists identify Dura-Europos\u2019 neglected sister site in Syria\n\nby Dario Radley\n\nApril 24, 2024\n\nArchaeology\n\n### 18th-century glass bottles of cherries found at Washington\u2019s Mount Vernon\n\nby Dario Radley\n\nApril 23, 2024\n\nArchaeology\n\n### Sculpture of snake-bodied deity found at Roman fort of Stuttgart\n\nby Dario Radley\n\nApril 22, 2024\n\nArchaeology\n\n### Anglo-Saxon King Cerdic\u2019s long-lost burial site uncovered!\n\nby Dario Radley\n\nApril 22, 2024\n\nAnthropology\n\n### Unique Roman lead coffin found to contain human child\u2019s remains\n\nby Dario Radley\n\nApril 21, 2024\n\nAnthropology\n\n### Rare \u2018porcelain gallbladder\u2019 found in early 20th-century asylum cemetery\n\nby Dario Radley\n\nApril 20, 2024\n\nArchaeology\n\n### Temple Mount sifting project uncovers 2,000-year-old clay token used by\npilgrims\n\nby Dario Radley\n\nApril 20, 2024\n\nArchaeology\n\n### Moon may have influenced Stonehenge builders\n\nby Dario Radley\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\n### Follow us\n\nInstagram 252K Facebook 98K Twitter 6.3K LinkedIn 7.2K YouTube 1K\n\n  * Trending\n  * Comments\n  * Latest\n\n### 17th-century Frenchwoman\u2019s gold dental work was likely torturous to her\nteeth\n\nFebruary 5, 2023\n\n### A 21-year-old student successfully deciphered the first word from the\nHerculaneum scrolls, charred during Mount Vesuvius\u2019 eruption\n\nOctober 31, 2023\n\n### Oldest ever genetic data from a human relative found in 2-million-year-old\nfossilized teeth\n\nJuly 11, 2023\n\n### Archaeologists uncover 2,000-year-old wooden bridge linking England and\nWales\n\nSeptember 4, 2023\n\n### 1,100-year-old Viking sword pulled from English river by magnet fisher\n\nMarch 7, 2024\n\n### 8-year-old boy unearths 1,800-year-old Roman coin in school sandbox\n\nAugust 29, 2023\n\n### Archaeologists found evidence of surgery on medieval woman\u2019s skull\n\nFebruary 15, 2023\n\n### Oldest ever genetic data from a human relative found in 2-million-year-old\nfossilized teeth\n\n### A 21-year-old student successfully deciphered the first word from the\nHerculaneum scrolls, charred during Mount Vesuvius\u2019 eruption\n\n### Shiyu site in northern China reveals evidence of an advanced material\nculture 45,000 years ago\n\n### Archaeologists uncover 2,000-year-old wooden bridge linking England and\nWales\n\n### Isles of Scilly Iron Age warrior was a woman, study says\n\n### Family ties detected in 17th-century colonial cemetery in Delaware\n\n### 4,000-year-old Bronze Age pyramid unearthed in Kazakhstan\u2019s steppes\n\n### Archaeologists identify Dura-Europos\u2019 neglected sister site in Syria\n\nApril 24, 2024\n\n### Carbonized Herculaneum papyrus reveals Plato\u2019s burial place\n\nApril 23, 2024\n\n### 18th-century glass bottles of cherries found at Washington\u2019s Mount Vernon\n\nApril 23, 2024\n\n### Sculpture of snake-bodied deity found at Roman fort of Stuttgart\n\nApril 22, 2024\n\n### Anglo-Saxon King Cerdic\u2019s long-lost burial site uncovered!\n\nApril 22, 2024\n\n### Unique Roman lead coffin found to contain human child\u2019s remains\n\nApril 21, 2024\n\n### Rare \u2018porcelain gallbladder\u2019 found in early 20th-century asylum cemetery\n\nApril 20, 2024\n\nArchaeology News is an international online magazine that covers all aspects\nof archaeology.\n\n## Categories\n\n  * Academics\n\n    * Books\n    * Conferences\n    * Universities\n  * Articles\n  * Download\n  * Game\n  * News\n\n    * Anthropology\n    * Archaeology\n    * Paleontology\n  * Quiz\n  * Tours\n\nMail Us: info@archaeologymag.com\n\n### Subscribe to our newsletter\n\n##### \u00a9 2024 - Archaeology News Online Magazine.
