We finally\ngot a good look at the gun.\n\nBy Anatoly ZakUpdated: Oct 24, 2022\n\nA quarter-century after the Cold War came to a close, the only cannon that\nactually fired in space has finally come to light.\n\nInstalled on the Almaz space station in the 1970s, the R-23M Kartech was\nderived from a powerful aircraft weapon; Aron Rikhter designed the original\n23-millimeter cannon for the Tupolev Tu-22 Blinder supersonic bomber. That gun\nis relatively well known, but its space-based cousin has largely remained in\nobscurity.\n\n## \u2705 You love badass machines. So do we. Let\u2019s nerd out over them\ntogether\u2014join Pop Mech Pro.\n\nThanks to a Russian television show, the world caught a grainy glimpse of the\nspace gun. Using that footage, we created a virtual model of the R-23M. This\nis the inside story.\n\nFrom the dawn of the Space Age, the prospect of American spacecraft\napproaching and inspecting Soviet military satellites\u2014which, according to the\nKremlin\u2019s propaganda, were not even supposed to exist\u2014terrified the secrecy-\nobsessed Soviet military. The fear of attack on spacecraft was real, with both\nsides of the Iron Curtain developing anti-satellite weapons. It seemed\nperfectly logical in the 1960s that the military and piloted spacecraft would\nneed self-defense weapons.\n\nAnatoly Zak\n\nA virtual model of the Soviet Union\u2019s secret space cannon.\n\nThe early Soviet space station project codenamed Almaz (\u201cdiamond\u201d) became the\nfirst real candidate for defensive space weaponry. The habitable outpost was\nintended almost exclusively for military purposes, starting with\nreconnaissance. Along with some state-of-the-art spy equipment, such as\ncameras and radar, Almaz would carry the cannon in its arsenal.\n\nThe USSR assigned the weapon\u2019s development to the Moscow-based KB Tochmash\ndesign bureau, led by Aleksandr Nudelman, whose engineers had distinguished\nthemselves with many breakthroughs in the field of aviation weaponry since\nWorld War II. For this project, Nudelman\u2019s team developed a 14.5-millimeter\nrapid-fire cannon that reportedly could hit targets as far as two miles away.\nDepending who you ask, the 37-pound weapon could fire from 950 to 5,000 shots\nper minute, blasting 200-gram shells at a velocity of 690 meters per second\n(1,500 miles per hour). According to veterans of the Almaz project, the space\ncannon successfully pierced a metal gasoline canister from a mile away during\nits ground tests.\n\n###### More Soviet Weapons\n\n  * The Soviet Tank That Changed the World\n  * The Terror of Russia\u2019s Nuclear Submarine Graveyard\n  * The Soviet Laser Space Pistol, Revealed\n\nThe physics of space stations limited the weapon, though. Although cosmonauts\ncould fire using an optical sight in their cockpit, they had to turn the\nentire 20-ton station to point the cannon toward its target.\n\nWhile R-23M had been in development since the mid-1960s, the rest of the Almaz\nproject dragged behind schedule. The station\u2019s fancy payloads and sensors took\nlonger than anticipated, and in the meantime, the idea itself got lukewarm\nsupport from the Soviet military, which was increasingly relying on unmanned\nsatellites for all its space needs. NASA\u2019s Skylab was scheduled to launch in\n1973, which meant the USSR faced the prospect of losing the race to put the\nfirst space station in orbit. So the Soviet government decided to build a\nsmall civilian outpost from off-the-shelf components of the Soyuz spacecraft\nand available Almaz hardware. The bread-and-butter orbital lab was\nsuccessfully launched in 1971 under the name Salyut.\n\nWikimedia Commons\n\nSalyut-3 diagram.\n\nAfter scoring the political points of winning the space station race, the\nKremlin allowed the Almaz project to proceed, but \u201ccamouflaged\u201d it behind the\ncivilian space stations. Until 1982, the USSR orbited a total of seven space\nstations under the name Salyut, but three of these were actually Almaz spy\nstations. The Western intelligence and independent observers quickly figured\nout which was which, but the Almaz program officially remained under wraps\nuntil the end of the Cold War.\n\nOnly after the fall of the USSR did Russian sources reveal that the cannon had\nactually fired in orbit. It happened on January 24, 1975, onboard the Salyut-3\nspace station. Worried about how firing a giant cannon would impact the\noutpost itself, Soviet officials scheduled the test firing just hours before\nthe planned de-orbiting of the station, and long after the departure of the\ncrew on July 19, 1974. The outpost ignited its jet thrusters simultaneously\nwith firing the cannon to counteract the weapon\u2019s powerful recoil. According\nto various sources, the cannon fired from one to three blasts, reportedly\nreleasing around 20 shells in all that would burn up in the atmosphere.\n\n###### More Military and Defense News\n\n  * How the B-29 Modernized the U.S. Air Force\n  * 14 Countries Practice Handling Nukes Together\n  * Will Russia Launch Its \u2018Apocalypse\u2019 Torpedo?\n\nThe results of the tests still remain classified. However, it appears that the\nfollow-up Almaz station was to be equipped with a pair of interceptor missiles\nrather than a cannon. It didn\u2019t matter: The upgraded Almaz was permanently\ngrounded before its scheduled launch in 1978.\n\nIn the intervening years, only one photo of the R-23M cannon has been\npublished. However, it now appears that the photo depicted the aircraft-based\nR-23 or some early prototype of the space-based weapon.\n\nFinally, grainy and dimly-lit TV footage of the space cannon appeared in the\nVoennaya Priemka, a military show produced by the Zvezda TV channel associated\nwith the Russian Ministry of Defense. The space cannon episode was shot inside\nthe limited-access corporate museum at KB Tochmash. Fortunately, a cameraman\nwent 360 degrees around the cannon, enabling us to screen-grab views of all\nsides of the hardware. We then imported the visuals into a sophisticated 3D\npackage and traced it with a digital mesh. The result was a virtual model of\nthe R-23M canon, one of the most exotic and secretive weapons of the Cold War.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This story was originally published in November 2015.\n\nAnatoly Zak\n\nAnatoly Zak is a publisher of RussianSpaceWeb.com and the author of \"Russia in\nSpace: the Past Explained, the Future Explored.\"\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n## The Secret Russian Space Program\n\nWhy Didn't the Soviets Ever Make It to the Moon?\n\nPop Mech Pro Pop Mech Pro\n\nWhy the VM-T Atlant Is Such a Badass Plane\n\nPop Mech Pro Pop Mech Pro\n\nEverything To Know About Russia\u2019s New Super Rocket\n\nRussia and NASA Suddenly Have a Lot To Talk About\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nRussia Might Resurrect a Soviet Era Mega Rocket\n\nSoyuz Spacecraft Could Find New Life as Lunar Taxi\n\nThe Soviet Laser Space Pistol, Revealed\n\nRoscosmos Might a Break Up With the U.S. for China\n\nRussia Is Building a Super Heavy Rocket of Its Own\n\nNASA and Russia Planned For the Moon This Week\n\nWhy Does Russia Have a Secret ISS Experiment?\n\nThe Rocket That Started the Space Race\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nA Part of Hearst Digital Media\n\nWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products\nwe back.\n\n\u00a92024 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.
