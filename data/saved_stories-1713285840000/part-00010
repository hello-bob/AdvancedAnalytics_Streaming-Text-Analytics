Since a million matching opinions do not constitute a\nfact, a consensus \u2014 either real or apparent \u2014 is not a statement about\nevidence but an exercise in groupthink in which the status quo is made\nexplicit.\n\nThus, scientific progress requires conservative and heretical thinkers \u2014\nconservatives protect the authority and continuity of science, whereas\nheretics put forth creative dissent in an attempt to push the limits of what\nwe know. Nevertheless, few people are willing and able to challenge the status\nquo \u2014 and those who have were often reviled, incarcerated, or executed (e.g.,\nGalileo, Semmelweis, and Vavilov).\n\nConsequently, when facts conflict with theory, academic researchers often\nignore the facts rather than confront the consensus. As a result, the\n\u2018marketplace of ideas\u2019 \u2014 and research funding \u2014 are predestined to conformity,\nsycophancy, and stasis. In other words, the more pervasive the consensus, the\nmore servile the research, the less probable the progress.\n\nAlthough this unfortunate reality is evident across many fields, it has been\nextremely detrimental to nutrition science. For more than 50 years, \u2018Diet-\ncentrism\u2019 \u2014 the theory that foods and beverages cause ill-health, obesity, and\ncardiometabolic diseases \u2014 has been accepted by physicians, researchers, and\nthe public almost without question. Yet despite the unity and ubiquity of the\nconsensus, there are centuries of evidence refuting diet-centric beliefs.\nThus, because a million matching but ill-informed opinions do not constitute a\nfact, the consensus linking calories, \u2018carbs\u2019, meat, milk, sugar, salt, fat,\ncholesterol, and \u2018ultra-processing\u2019 to death and disease is not a statement\nabout scientific evidence but the obsequious \u2014 and sterile \u2014 status-quo made\nexplicit.\n\nAccordingly, herein I present the heretical idea that the na\u00efve determinism of\n\u2018Diet-centrism\u2019 \u2014 \u2018you are what you eat\u2019 and \u2018what you eat is killing you\u2019 \u2014\nis not only simplistic and unscientific but specious because it ignores the\nfact that individual differences in metabolism (how the body \u2018handles\u2019 foods\nand beverages) is what matters most in diet-related health and disease.\n\nHistorical Evidence: It\u2019s not the Food\n\nBefore the 20th century, obesity and cardiometabolic diseases such as type-2\ndiabetes mellitus (T2DM) were uncommon. Yet over the past 50 years, the\nprevalence of these maladies in horses, humans, dogs, cats, lab, and zoo\nanimals increased to epidemic proportions. Given that these herbivores,\nomnivores, and carnivores have always consumed different diets, the claim that\nfoods and beverages have suddenly caused parallel epidemics in different\nspecies is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence. Yet\nthere is no valid evidence supporting this belief.\n\nTo begin, humans have consumed highly palatable, \u2018ultra-processed\u2019 foods and\nbeverages for thousands of years. Refined sugar, salt, butter, and cheeses\ndate from 4000-8000 BC, and pasta, pizza, and pretzels were consumed in the\n1st century AD. Although the consumption of \u2018french-fries\u2019 (\u2018chips\u2019 in the UK)\nonly began in the 17th century, potatoes fried in salt and animal fat quickly\nbecame the main source of nutrition in Ireland. By the 19th century, the Irish\nconsumed ~4-5 lbs. of potatoes per person per day, with men consuming ~8-12\nlbs./day. This is the equivalent of ~40 supersized servings of \u2018french-fries\u2019\nevery day for a lifetime. Yet despite consuming massive amounts of \u2018carbs\u2019,\nsaturated fats, and salt, the Irish had little obesity or cardiometabolic\ndiseases.\n\nSimilarly, the Amish \u2014 an ethno-religious group in the US \u2014 consume a high-\ncalorie, highly-palatable diet that includes meat, potatoes, gravy, eggs,\nbreads, pies, and cakes, and \u201cis quite high in fat and refined sugar\u201d. Yet the\nAmish have a greater life expectancy and substantially lower obesity, T2DM,\nheart disease, and cancer than other Americans.\n\nImportantly, all humans start life consuming ~40% of their daily calories as\ndietary sugars and 25% as saturated fat \u2014 either in breast milk or infant\nformula (an \u2018ultra-processed\u2019, sugar-sweetened beverage with \u2018added\u2019 sugars,\nsalts, and fats). Thus, recommendations to restrict \u2018added\u2019 sugars and\n\u2018processed\u2019 foods would prevent the feeding of most infants in industrialized\nnations. And contrary to current rhetoric, nations with the highest rates of\nsugar-sweetened beverage (formula) consumption by infants have the lowest\nrates of obesity and cardiometabolic diseases (Japan and Norway). Moreover,\nsugars added to foods and beverages enter the same metabolic pathways as\nintrinsic sugars. Thus, the glucose molecules in breast milk and the fructose\nmolecules in fruit are exactly the same glucose and fructose molecules as in\nsoda, sports drinks, and your favorite candy. This basic fact of biochemistry\nshows that the term \u2018added sugar\u2019 has no place in scientific discourse.\n\nFurthermore, the medicinal use of sucrose (table sugar) for malnutrition and\ndiarrheal diseases saves the lives of over 600,000 children each year. Thus,\nso-called \u2018added\u2019 sugars save more lives than any pharmaceutical agent. So if\n\u2018food is medicine\u2019, then table sugar is the greatest medicine of all. [Note:\nthe phrase \u201clet thy food be thy medicine\u201d was fabricated by a journalist and\nattributed to Hippocrates to sell a diet book in the 1920s.]\n\nAdditionally, the most comprehensive report on dietary sugars \u2014 published\nbefore the current anti-sugar hysteria \u2014 concluded that \u201cfeeding normal human\nvolunteers at levels of fructose approximating the 90th percentile intake\nlevels of the U.S. population failed to demonstrate adverse effects on insulin\nsensitivity or glucose tolerance [cardiometabolic health].\u201d And contrary to\ncurrent rhetoric, over the last two decades the use of sugars & sweeteners in\nthe US declined ~16% as obesity and T2DM increased almost 40% and severe\nobesity increased 96%. Thus, less sugar is linked to more obesity and diabetes\n\u2014 and this so-called \u2018sugar paradox\u2019 is ubiquitous (see Australia and the UK).\n\nIn sum, by ignoring contrary evidence, academic researchers and their \u2018diet-\ncentric\u2019 consensus created a \u201cfictional discourse on diet-disease relations\u201d.\n\nThe Logic of Causality\n\nThe search for universal criteria by which to infer causality has eluded\nphilosophers of science for centuries. Yet, at its simplest, the search for\ncauses is the search for \u2018differences that make a difference\u2019 \u2014 mere\nassociations are meaningless. For example, water (and other liquids) are\nassociated with 100% of drowning deaths. Therefore, in the absence of water no\none drowns. Yet despite the perfect correlation and counterfactual evidence,\nno educated person argues that water causes drowning because not everyone who\ndrinks, bathes, or swims, drowns. In other words, water is not causal because\nit is not the \u2018difference that makes a difference\u2019.\n\nTo be precise, water is a sine qua non for drowning (an indispensable part or\nessential element) \u2014 not a cause. Thus, given the same environment (the\npresence of water), individual differences such as the inability to swim,\nintoxication, or insentience cause a person to drown.\n\nThe Illogicity of Blaming Food\n\nFoods and beverages are a sine qua non for life \u2014 everyone must eat and drink.\nYet just as water does not cause drowning because not everyone who drinks,\nbathes, or swims, drowns \u2014 diet does not cause poor metabolic health because\nnot everyone who eats and drinks becomes obese or diabetic. Yet in contrast to\nthe perfect correlation between water and drowning, there is no clear\ncorrelation between diet and obesity.\n\nFor example, muscular, male athletes consume more calories, \u2018carbs\u2019, sugars,\nsalt, fat, cholesterol, and \u2018ultra-processed\u2019 foods than obese, sedentary\nwomen, yet have lower levels of adiposity and T2DM. Thus, more foods,\nbeverages, and physical activity are linked with better health and less\ndisease. Clearly, athletes\u2019 bodies \u2018handle\u2019 their diets differently than those\nof sedentary people. Therefore, metabolism \u2014 not diet \u2014 is the \u2018difference\nthat makes a difference\u2019 in health.\n\nSimilarly, in a 2013 study, my colleagues and I found that the people\nperforming the least amount of physical activity gained the most fat mass \u2014\ndespite consuming less calories, less fat, and less sugar than those who ate\nmore, performed more activity, and maintained their weight. Conversely,\nreducing physical activity causes an immediate decline in insulin sensitivity\nand metabolic health. Therefore, physical activity-induced differences in\nmetabolism \u2014 not diet \u2014 cause differences in caloric intake, fat mass, and\nhealth.\n\nMoreover, metabolism is the \u2018difference that makes a difference\u2019 in the \u2018Oral\nGlucose Tolerance Test\u2019 (OGTT) \u2014 a widely used test for diabetes and insulin\nresistance. In the OGTT, blood sugar is measured after patients consume a\nstandard dose of dietary sugar. Over time, patients with weaker metabolisms\nhave higher blood sugar than those with stronger metabolisms. Thus, given\nidentical amounts of dietary sugar, differences in metabolism cause\ndifferences in blood sugar. It is nonsensical to argue that the dietary sugar\ncaused the differences in blood sugar when each patient consumed the same\namount.\n\nWhat confuses most people \u2014 and [too] many researchers \u2014 is that different\nfoods and beverages cause different metabolic responses. For example,\nconsuming sugar or starch causes greater increases in blood sugar than\nconsuming fat or protein. However, as the OGTT shows, it is not the increase\nin blood sugar after a meal that matters to cardiometabolic health but the\ndecrease over time.\n\nStated simply, consuming dietary sugar increases everyone\u2019s blood sugar \u2014 but\nnot everyone\u2019s blood sugar returns to \u2018normal\u2019 after a meal (e.g., diabetics).\nThus, the diet-induced increase in blood sugar is irrelevant to\ncardiometabolic health because it is not the \u2018difference that makes a\ndifference\u2019. What matters are the metabolic differences that cause blood sugar\nto decrease \u2014 or not \u2014 after a meal.\n\nYet most importantly, as a recent \u201cintensive food-as-medicine program\u201d showed,\naltering your diet has little effect on cardiometabolic health over time,\nwhereas adequate physical activity \u201cobliterates the deleterious effects of a\nhigh-caloric intake\u201d. This explains why muscular athletes can consume massive\namounts of calories, \u2018carbs\u2019, and \u2018ultra-processed\u2019 foods yet remain lean and\nhealthy.\n\nIn sum, differences in metabolism \u2014 not diet \u2014 cause differences in\ncardiometabolic health.\n\n\u2018Differences that Make a Difference\u2019 in Obesity and Metabolic Strength\n\nIf people perform hard physical labor, they will consume more food, water, and\noxygen than if they sat quietly in an office. Therefore, increased physical\nactivity causes increases in metabolism that \u2014 in turn \u2014 cause increases in\nconsumption (eating, drinking, and breathing). Therefore, if you \u2018burn\u2019 more\ncalories through physical activity, you increase your metabolic strength,\nconsume more calories, and maintain your weight. This fact explains why\nexercise rarely leads to weight-loss but is essential in health and preventing\nweight gain.\n\nConversely, when people reduce their physical activity \u2018too much\u2019 (below their\n\u2018metabolic tipping point\u2019), they weaken their metabolism. This causes them to\nconsume more calories than they burn. In time, this leads to \u2018acquired\u2019\nobesity and cardiometabolic diseases \u2014 independent of diet. In other words, a\nminimum amount of physical activity is needed for health, and individuals with\nextremely low levels will, over time, become obese, diabetic, or both \u2014\nregardless of the foods and beverages they consume.\n\nImportantly, if a woman\u2019s physical activity is too low, her metabolism will be\ntoo weak to \u2018handle\u2019 pregnancy and she will consume too many calories. As a\nresult, her children will be born fatter and with weaker metabolisms. In other\nwords, they \u2018inherit\u2019 a life-long predisposition to obesity and\ncardiometabolic diseases. [Note: the non-genetic process of inheritance by\nwhich a mother\u2019s prenatal metabolism irreversibly alters her descendants\u2019\nmetabolism is known as a \u2018maternal-effect\u2019].\n\nConsequently, the fact that women \u2019move less\u2019 than they did five decades ago\nexplains the recent rise in \u2018inherited\u2019 (childhood) obesity and adolescent\nT2DM. For example, from 1965 to 2010, the time women spent doing housework\ndecreased by ~2 hours per day while sedentary time increased by 1 hour/day.\nThis reduced the number of calories burned by ~250/day and doubled the amount\nof time spent sitting. By 2020, women spent more time sitting in front of the\nTV and using social media than cooking, cleaning, childcare, exercise, and\nlaundry combined. As a result, their metabolisms became weaker \u2014 and because\nmetabolic strength is essential for a healthy pregnancy, the decline produced\nsuccessive generations of obese children with weak metabolisms.\n\nMoreover, because all mammals share the metabolic pathways of pregnancy, my\nwork suggests that \u2018maternal-effects\u2019 caused the parallel epidemics of obesity\nand cardiometabolic diseases in horses, humans, dogs, cats, lab, and zoo\nanimals.\n\nConclusion\n\nConsensus in academic research is rarely a statement about evidence. More\noften, it is an exercise in groupthink in which the status quo \u2014 right or\nwrong \u2014 is made explicit. Thus, progress needs heretics who are willing and\nable to challenge the consensus. Accordingly, I presented the heretical idea\nthat humans have always consumed highly palatable, processed foods and\nbeverages without increases in obesity or cardiometabolic diseases. Moreover,\n\u2018acquired\u2019 and \u2018inherited\u2019 differences in metabolism \u2014 not diet \u2014 cause\nobesity and poor metabolic health. Thus, the \u2018diet-centric\u2019 consensus linking\ncalories, \u2018carbs\u2019, meat, milk, sugar, salt, fat, cholesterol, and \u2018ultra-\nprocessing\u2019 to death and disease is not only simplistic, but sterile and\nunscientific.\n\nNevertheless, given that science progresses \u2018funeral by funeral\u2019 and that\nfood-based fears generate profitable marketing campaigns (e.g., low-fat and no\n\u2018added\u2019 sugars) and billions of dollars to fund academic research, \u2018Diet-\ncentrism\u2019 will be the dominant paradigm in nutrition \u2018science\u2019 for the\nforeseeable future.
