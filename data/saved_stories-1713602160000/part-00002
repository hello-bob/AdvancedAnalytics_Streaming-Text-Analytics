In these\nidentically constructed traps, ions in the excited quantum state and in the\nground state can be measured in comparison. In order to minimize\nuncertainties, the ions are also moved back and forth between different traps\nfor comparative measurements. Credit: MPIK\n\nWhat is the mass of a neutrino at rest? This is one of the big unanswered\nquestions in physics. Neutrinos play a central role in nature. A team led by\nKlaus Blaum, Director at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in\nHeidelberg, has now made an important contribution in \"weighing\" neutrinos as\npart of the international ECHo collaboration. Their findings are published in\nNature Physics.\n\nUsing a Penning trap, it has measured the change in mass of a holmium-163\nisotope with extreme precision when its nucleus captures an electron and turns\ninto dysprosium-163. From this, it was able to determine the Q value 50 times\nmore accurately than before. Using a more precise Q-value, possible systematic\nerrors in the determination of the neutrino mass can be revealed.\n\nIn the 1930s, it turned out that neither the energy nor the momentum balance\nis correct in the radioactive beta decay of an atomic nucleus. This led to the\npostulate of \"ghost particles\" that \"secretly\" carry away energy and momentum.\nIn 1956, experimental proof of such neutrinos was finally obtained. The\nchallenge: neutrinos only interact with other particles of matter via the weak\ninteraction that is also underlying the beta decay of an atomic nucleus.\n\nFor this reason, hundreds of trillions of neutrinos from the cosmos,\nespecially the sun, can pass through our bodies every second without causing\nany damage. Extremely rare neutrino collisions with other particles of matter\ncan only be detected with huge detectors.\n\nSolar neutrinos brought another ground-breaking revelation: the three types of\nneutrino known to date can transform into each other. However, these \"neutrino\noscillations\" had a serious consequence for the world view of particle\nphysics. Previously, it was assumed that neutrinos had no rest mass, like\nphotons.\n\nThis would be compatible with the standard model of particle physics, the best\ndescription of the particle world to date. However, the oscillations forced a\nrest mass for neutrinos\u2014a further indication that new physics must exist\nbeyond the standard model.\n\nKnowing the exact rest mass of the neutrino would therefore be an open sesame\ninto the unknown world of new physics. Unfortunately, you cannot simply place\na neutrino on a scale. This requires extremely complex experiments on\ntechnically accessible physical processes involving neutrinos.\n\n\"One way is the beta decay of tritium,\" explains Christoph Schweiger, doctoral\nstudent in Klaus Blaum's department at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear\nPhysics. Here, one of the two neutrons in the super heavy hydrogen decays into\na proton and emits an electron and a neutrino, thereby transforming the atom\ninto lighter helium. This process is \"weighed\" by the KATRIN experiment at the\nKarlsruhe Institute of Technology.\n\n\"The complementary path is the electron capture of the artificial isotope\nholmium-163,\" continues Schweiger. Here, the atomic nucleus captures an\nelectron from the inner electron shell, whereby a proton is converted into a\nneutron, resulting in the element dysprosium-163. This also releases a\nneutrino, among other things. The international ECHo collaboration, in which\nthe Heidelberg scientists are involved, attempts to measure this decay process\nenergetically with extreme precision.\n\nAccording to Einstein's E = mc^2, mass and energy are equivalent, so measuring\nenergy can be equated with weighing masses. As a \"calorimeter,\" ECHo measures\nextremely accurately the total energy released in this decay: This corresponds\nto a maximum of the Q value minus the rest mass of the neutrino released. For\nthis purpose, the holmium-163 isotope is incorporated into a layer of gold\natoms.\n\n\"However, these gold atoms could have an influence on holmium-163,\" explains\nSchweiger. \"It is therefore important to measure the value of Q as precisely\nas possible using an alternative method and to compare it with the\ncalorimetrically determined value in order to detect possible systematic\nsources of error.\"\n\nThis is where the Heidelberg pentatrap experiment and Schweiger's doctoral\nthesis come into play. Pentatrap consists of five Penning traps. In these\ntraps, electrically charged atoms can be captured in a combination of a static\nelectric and magnetic field.\n\nThese ions perform an intricate \"circle dance,\" which allows their mass to be\ndetermined with extreme precision. \"With an Airbus A-380 with a maximum load,\nyou could use this sensitivity to determine whether a single drop of water has\nlanded on it,\" says the physicist, illustrating the capabilities of this super\nscale.\n\nIn principle, a Penning trap works like a swing. If you place two children of\ndifferent weights next to each other on two swings of the same type and push\nthem equally hard, you will gradually observe a shift in the swing\nfrequencies. This can be used to calculate the difference in weight between\nthe two children.\n\nIn the case of the pentatrap experiment, this is the difference in mass\nbetween a holmium-163 ion and a dysprosium-163 ion. In addition, the faster\nboth children swing, the sooner the result is obtained, which is also much\nmore accurate for the same observation time than for slow swinging.\n\nFor this reason, the team removed 38, 39 and 40 electrons from the \"highly\ncharged\" ions in three different series of measurements, which makes their\n\"circle dance\" considerably faster. \"If everything works, a measurement will\nonly take a few weeks,\" says Schweiger.\n\nFrom the differences in mass as a result of various frequency measurements,\nvia E = mc^2 the Heidelberg scientists were finally able to determine a Q\nvalue for electron capture that was 50 times more precise than before. \"The\ncontribution of the three theory groups, including Christoph Keitel's group\nhere at the institute, was just as important as our measurement,\" emphasizes\nSchweiger.\n\nIn addition to the frequency difference between the two ions, a second\nvariable has a significant influence on the Q value determined: the energy\nstored in the remaining electron system of a highly charged ion. As such a\nlarge ion is a multi-particle system, the calculation was correspondingly\ncomplex.\n\nIt turned out that the calculations resulted in almost exactly the same Q\nvalues for the three measured charge states with 38, 39 and 40 electrons\nremoved. This made it clear that systematic uncertainties in experiment and\ntheory could be ruled out, Schweiger emphasizes enthusiastically. And what\ndoes this mean for the neutrino masses?\n\nKATRIN determined the most precise upper limit to date of the neutrino mass by\n\"weighing\" at 0.8 electron volt per speed of light squared, which corresponds\nto an unimaginable 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000014 kilogram.\n\nThis order of magnitude of 10^-36 corresponds approximately to the weight\nratio between four raisins and the sun. And that is only an upper limit. The\nanalysis of the estimated mass distribution in the universe even arrives at a\nsignificantly lower upper limit of the neutrino masses of 0.12 electron volt\nper speed of light squared.\n\n\"However, this analysis is highly complex and depends on the cosmological\nmodel used,\" says Schweiger. In any case, it is clear that anyone who wants to\nweigh neutrinos faces extreme challenges at the edge of what is technically\npossible. Against this background, the Heidelberg result is a major step\nforward on the way to solving the mystery of neutrino masses.\n\nMore information: Direct high-precision Penning-trap measurement of the\nQ-value of the electron capture in 163Ho for the determination of the electron\nneutrino mass, Nature Physics (2024).
