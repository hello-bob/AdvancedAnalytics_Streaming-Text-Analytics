We are\nconcerned that known special interest groups are actively blocking medical\neducation that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and medical community\nhave determined are needed. These actions stand to prolong use and possibly\nincrease consumption of combustible cigarettes\u2014the most harmful form of\nnicotine use.\u201d\n\nBut Tim McAfee at the University of California, San Francisco and former\ndirector of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Office on Smoking\nand Health, called PMI\u2019s partnership with Medscape, \u201cthe ultimate example of\nthe fox not only signing up to guard the hen house but offering to sit on the\neggs.\n\n\u201cIt is a perversion of ethics surrounding continuing medical education to\nallow the very companies that caused and profit from the continuing epidemic\nof tobacco-related death and disease to be involved in any way,\u201d he said.\n\nMedscape claims that the course content complied fully with standards set by\nthe Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME), but Pamela\nLing, director of the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the\nUniversity of California San Francisco, said if so, \u201cthen the standards need\nto be strengthened to ensure they don\u2019t allow merchants of death to educate\ndoctors.\u201d\n\nThis view is supported in a linked editorial by Professor Ruth Malone at the\nUniversity of California San Francisco, who says \u201chealth professionals, health\nleaders, their societies and professional organisations must demand that the\nbodies accrediting continuing medical education for clinicians enact policies\nbanning content sponsored by tobacco-affiliated organisations.\u201d\n\nHealth professional and patient organisations should also caution their\nmembers to be aware that the tobacco industry is attempting to influence\npatient care in favour of its products, she adds.\n\nShe highlights that Medscape is not the only company offering CME, and PMI may\nnot be the only tobacco company working to influence health professionals in\nthis way, and says similar offerings should be widely publicised and the\nrelevant educational providers notified that tobacco industry sponsorship is\nunacceptable.\n\n\u201cThe tobacco industry cannot be allowed to influence medical education, health\npractitioners, or patient care in this way as it desperately seeks to secure\nits future profits,\u201d she concludes.\n\n26/04/2024\n\nNotes for editors Investigation: Medscape caves in on courses funded by\ntobacco giant while medics fear global Philip Morris push into medical\neducation doi: 10.1136/bmj.q948 Editorial: Stop tobacco industry sponsorship\nof continuing medical education doi: 10.1136/bmj.q950 Journal: The BMJ\n\nFunding: BMJ Investigations Unit\n\nThe Examination is a nonprofit investigative newsroom covering global public\nhealth that is supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies, the Pulitzer Center and\nothers.\n\nLink to Academy of Medical Sciences press release labelling system:\nhttps://press.psprings.co.uk/AMSlabels.pdf\n\nExternally peer reviewed?
