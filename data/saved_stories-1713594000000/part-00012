Authorities soon determined the\nsystem that controlled the city\u2019s water supply had been hacked. In two hours,\ntens of thousands of gallons of water had flowed into the street and drain\npipes.\n\nThe hackers posted a video online of the town\u2019s water-control systems and a\nnearby town being manipulated, showing how they reset the controls. In the\nvideo on the messaging platform Telegram, they called themselves Cyber Army of\nRussia Reborn (CARR).\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting another raid on the USA,\u201d the video caption reads in Russian,\nwith the hackers saying they would show how they exploited \u201ca couple critical\ninfrastructure facilities, namely water supply systems.\u201d It was followed by a\nsmiley face emoji.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat water tank overflow in a Texas panhandle town may well be linked to one\nof the most infamous Russian government hacking groups, the cybersecurity firm\nMandiant said Wednesday.\n\nIf confirmed, analysts say it would mark a worrisome escalation by Moscow in\nits attempts to disrupt critical U.S. infrastructure by targeting one of its\nweakest sectors: water utilities.\n\nThe hacking group, which private sector analysts once dubbed Sandworm, has\nachieved notoriety for briefly turning out the lights in parts of Ukraine at\nleast three different times; hacking the Olympics Opening Games in South Korea\nin 2018; and launching NotPetya, one of the most damaging cyberattacks ever\nthat cost businesses worldwide tens of billions of dollars.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAlthough no one was hurt and service was not interrupted in Muleshoe, the\nprospect of Sandworm broadening its sites from Ukrainian power grids and\nFrench elections to American critical infrastructure is troubling, Mandiant\nchief analyst John Hultquist said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe U.S. government assesses Sandworm to be part of the GRU, Russia\u2019s military\nspy agency.\n\nFollow Technology\n\nThe team at Mandiant, which is owned by Google, observed social media accounts\nbeing created on YouTube for CARR using servers associated with Sandworm,\nHultquist said, adding that Mandiant also has found CARR posting Ukrainian\ngovernment data stolen by Sandworm hackers on Telegram.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been saying for a long time that CARR is just a front for the GRU,\u201d\nHultquist said. \u201cThen we see them take credit for these acts in the U.S.\nagainst water utilities. Is GRU behind these attacks? If it isn\u2019t GRU, whoever\nis doing this is working out of the same clubhouse. It\u2019s too close for\ncomfort.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community has not yet made a determination whether CARR\nis run by the GRU, although intelligence analysts are scouring clues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobert M. Lee, CEO and co-founder of Dragos, which specializes in industrial\ncontrol system cybersecurity, said a team from his firm tracked CARR\u2019s\noperations in January. He confirmed the water overflow in Muleshoe but could\nnot specify whether this happened in other towns. \u201cThe adversary was\ndefinitely looking to do disruptions,\u201d he said, noting that the trend over the\nlast several years has been for state actors to seek to disrupt systems,\nwhereas a decade ago, they were interested mostly in espionage.\n\nAnother target was the nearby town of Abernathy. The city\u2019s manager, Don\nProvost, said in an interview that the hack \u201cdidn\u2019t interrupt anything.\u201d The\nFBI and Department of Homeland Security got in touch quickly, he said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cIt actually turned out to be a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt showed us where our\nvulnerabilities were.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an interview, Muleshoe\u2019s city manager, Ramon Sanchez, said the hackers\nbrute-forced the password for the system\u2019s control system interface, which was\nrun by a vendor. That password hadn\u2019t been changed in more than a decade, he\nadmitted.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen to you. It\u2019s always going to happen to\nthe other guy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe same vendor was used by at least two other towns in the area that were\nsubjected to attempted hacks, Sanchez said.\n\nBut the incident also forced changes. \u201cWe learned,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cThe biggest\nlesson is that we have to always be proactive and always update our\ncybersecurity.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nHe thinks Muleshoe was a \u201cvictim of opportunity,\u201d adding: \u201cI would have never\nthought that somebody tied to the Russian military would target Muleshoe.\u201d\n\nAaron Schaffer contributed to this report.\n\n###\n\nInside the industry\n\nMicrosoft invests in Arabic AI firm as U.S. tries to limit China\u2019s sway (By\nAaron Gregg and Cat Zakrzewski)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAI is creating an influx of child sex abuse images, data shows (Forbes)\n\nFormer OpenAI board member calls for audits of top AI companies (Bloomberg\nNews)\n\nZuckerberg wins bid to avoid personal liability in addiction lawsuits (The\nHill)\n\nMusk\u2019s X retreats, pledging to comply with Brazil court orders (Bloomberg\nNews)\n\n###\n\nPrivacy monitor\n\nSome ex-TikTok employees say the social media service worked closely with its\nChina-based parent despite claims of independence (Fortune)\n\n###\n\nWorkforce report\n\nAmazon HQ2 was supposed to add jobs last year.
