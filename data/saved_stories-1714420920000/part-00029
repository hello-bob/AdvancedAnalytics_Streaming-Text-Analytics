Take these results with\na big grain of salt. Correlation is not causation!\n\nZinc is said to support the immune system, improve sleep, regulate blood\nsugar, among other things. I put zinc to the test, measuring how my zinc\nintake correlated with my sleep and vital stats (captured with a WHOOP band\nand an Apple Watch).\n\nOne unit in the graph corresponds to 25mg zinc. The initial high dosage was in\nerror, but did not lead to any adverse effects.\n\n## Potential benefits of zinc\n\nIn my 120-day experiment, zinc intake correlated with:\n\n  * Decreased sleep respiratory rate\n  * Later bedtimes\n  * Improved Heart Rate Variability\n\nMy takeaways from this experiment:\n\n  * I might have had a slight zinc deficiency\n  * I experienced no strong adverse effects from supplementing zinc\n  * Zinc supplementation could be a reason for my improved sleep and recovery\n\n## Risks\n\nIf you do decide to try supplementing zinc yourself, be sure to not go over\nthe recommended dose. Excessive zinc intake can cause nausea, abdominal pain,\nand impaired immune function, among other things. Consult healthcare\nprofessionals before starting any new supplement regimen.\n\nIf you want to include zinc in your diet, some foods high in zinc are:\noysters, crab, beef, chickpeas, cashews, and oats.\n\n## Other supplements\n\n  * Vitamin D\n\nLongevityLab allows you to track anything, in any way you want.
