Even if you don't\nexhibit AFR symptoms when drinking alcohol, your ALDH activity may still be\ndecreased.\n\nMany people in the rational sphere have been promoting Lumina/BCS3-L1, a\ngenetically engineered bacterium, as an anti-cavity treatment. However, none\nhave brought up a major negative interaction that may occur with a common\ngenetic mutation.\n\nIn short, the treatment works by replacing lactic acid generating bacteria in\nthe mouth with ones that instead convert sugars to ethanol, among other\nchanges. Scott Alexander made a pretty good FAQ about this. Lactic acid\nresults in cavities and teeth demineralization, while ethanol does not. I\nthink this is a really cool idea, and would definitely try it if I didn't\nthink it would significantly increase my chances of getting oral cancer.\n\nWhy would that be? Well, I, like around half of East Asians, have a mutation\nin my acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) which results in it being considerably\nless active. This is known as Asian/Alcohol Flush Reaction (AFR). This results\nin decreased ability to metabolize acetaldehyde to acetate and consequently a\nmuch higher level of acetaldehyde when drinking alcohol. Although the time\ningested ethanol spends in the mouth and stomach are quite short, alcohol\ndehydrogenase activity by both human and bacterial cells rises rapidly once\nthe presence of ethanol is detected. Some studies have estimated that ~20% of\nconsumed ethanol is converted to acetaldehyde in the mouth and stomach in a\nprocess called first pass metabolism. Normally, this is broken down into\nacetate by the ALDH also present, but it instead builds up in those with AFR.\nAcetaldehyde is a serious carcinogen and people with AFR have significantly\nhigher levels of oral and stomach cancer (The odds ratios for Japanese\nalcoholics with the mutation in relation to various cancers are >10 (!!!) for\noral and esophageal cancer). The Japanese paper also notes that all alcoholics\ntested only had a single copy of the mutation, since it is very difficult to\nbecome an alcoholic with two copies (imagine being on high dosage Antabuse\nyour entire life - that's the same physiological effect).\n\nIn addition, there is also the potential for change in oral flora and their\nresting ADH levels. As oral flora and epithelial cells adapt to a higher\nresting level of ethanol, they may make the convertion of ethanol to\nacetaldehyde even faster, resulting in higher peak oral and stomach levels of\nacetaldehyde during recreational drinking, thereby increasing cancer risk.\n\nThere is also the concern of problems further down the digestive track -\nJapanese alcoholics with AFR also have increased (~3x) colorectal cancer\nrates, which may well be due to ethanol being fermented from sugars in the\nlarge intestines, but my research in that direction is limited and this\narticle is getting too long.\n\nWhile others have argued that the resulting acetaldehyde levels would be too\nlow to be a full body carcinogen (they make a similar calculation in regards\nto ethanol in this FAQ), my concern isn't systemic - it's local. AFR increases\noral and throat cancer risks most of all, and the first pass metabolism\nstudies imply that oral and gastral acetaldehyde are elevated far above levels\nfound in the blood.\n\nAs a thought experiment, consider that a few drops of concentrated sulfuric\nacid can damage your tongue even though an intraperitoneal (abdominal cavity)\ninjection of the same would be harmless - high local concentrations matter!\nThe same is true for concentration in time - the average pH of your tongue on\nthat day would be quite normal, but a few seconds of contact with high\nconcentrations of acid is enough to do damage. This is why I'm not convinced\nby calculations that show only a small overall increase in acetaldehyde levels\nin the average person. A few minutes of high oral acetaldehyde levels a day is\nenough to cause oral cancer - that's how it works in people with AFR when they\ndrink alcohol!\n\nBut perhaps the increase in acetaldehyde is simply too low to cause\nsignificant problems, even in the mouth? I think this is possible, but\nunlikely. The reason Lumina was created at was because of cavities. Most oral\nbacteria convert sugars to lactic acid as the end product of anaerobic\nmetabolism. This results in cavities when mouth pH is lowered below 5.5. My\nback-of-envelope calculation say that this implies a 0.01 mol solution of\nlactic acid, or about 5% by mass. This may well be even higher in practice\nsince saliva acts as a pH buffer. Note that while resting saliva samples\nrarely measure below 6.3 pH, it can drop down to 4.0 after drinking certain\nsugary drinks (somehow, this topic is underresearched. Is this why people\ncomplain about dental science?). Notably, this is caused by sugar metabolism.\nSour milk, sugarless coffee, and light (diet) coke resulted in much higher\noral pHs than their sugary counterparts. Again, transient local exposure of\noral epithelium to acetaldehyde is exactly what causes the elevated oral\ncancer risk in the first place, and similar exposure to lactic acid is what\ncauses cavities. Is it possible that acetaldehyde and ethanol behave\ndifferently from lactic acid? Maybe. But the weight of evidence is enough to\nmake me concerned.\n\nAll considered, I personally consider the negatives of potential cancer risk\ngreater than the positives of cavity prevention for someone with AFR. I would\nrecommend further research on oral acetaldehyde for people with and without\nALDH deficiency who have already taken the treatment, advice against the use\nof Lumina for those known to have the mutation, and urge those of East Asian\nancestry to test themselves if they are unsure. As a reminder, ALDH deficiency\nis a semi-dominant mutation - you may have the phenotype even if you have a\nlow East Asian admixture.\n\nExcerpts from Scott's FAQ follow:\n\nConflict of Interest: If you've already used Lumina and regularly kiss Asians,\nthis may be a concern. However, my interest in kissing women outweighs my\ninterest in not having cancer, so I recommend no change in behavior.\n\nMy recommendations would be:\n\n  1. Measure acetaldehyde levels in the saliva/oral plaque samples of users of the probiotic who are known to have AFR before, during, and after food, sugary drink, and alcohol consumption.\n  2. Ask if a fruity smell has appeared in the breaths of Lumina users, especially those with AFR - acetaldehyde is responsible for the fruity smell associated with drinking alcohol. There is nothing suggesting this on Twitter, which is a good sign.\n  3. Don't use Lumina if you have AFR or aren't sure. Update: even if you can handle your liquor, you may well still have an ALDH variant that decreases ALDH activity. I would undergo genetic testing, just to be sure. If you have two copies of the mutation, be extra careful. If you already did use Lumina, your risk of cancer may have increased. Consider drinking less alcohol, and take oral hygiene more seriously.\n  4. Monitoring oral flora changes and the speed of oral ethanol -> acetaldehyde conversion.\n  5. Do more research on the interpersonal spread of BCS3-L1 after application.\n  6. If the bounty for finding new problems with Lumina is still active, I hope this qualifies for more than $100. I am also more than happy to participate in additional research. I think the additional introduction of bacteria with high ALDH activity might work and also decrease the effect of hangovers, which would be nice and also a potential product. Hey, another reason to hire me!\n  7. Update: if you frequently drink alcohol, I would also advise against using Lumina.\n  8. Update: check if hangovers get worse over time in Lumina users\n\nUpdate: I am reminded that ALDH polymorphism isn't restricted to Asians, and\nthat many variants which don't heavily disrupt drinking can still result in\nsignificant increases in acetaldehyde levels. I would recommend everyone\ninterested in getting Lumina to undergo genetic testing beforehand.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2659709/https://sci-\nhub.ru/10.1093/oxfordjournals.alcalc.a044598\n\n## New to LessWrong?\n\nGetting Started\n\nFAQ\n\nLibrary\n\nHealth / Medicine / Disease4Biology2World Optimization2\n\nFrontpage\n\n# 136\n\nReconsider the anti-cavity bacteria if you are Asian\n\n15th Apr 2024\n\n27romeostevensit\n\n25Lao Mein\n\n2romeostevensit\n\n11lc\n\n5Lao Mein\n\n3GeneSmith\n\n11Cesare\n\n7Lao Mein\n\n10bruberu\n\n5Lao Mein\n\n4Seth Herd\n\n7npostavs\n\n8ryan_greenblatt\n\n6Lao Mein\n\n4Seth Herd\n\n3Yair Halberstadt\n\n2Lao Mein\n\n2Michael Roe\n\nNew Comment\n\n18 comments, sorted by\n\ntop scoring\n\nClick to highlight new comments since: Today at 8:01 AM\n\n[-]romeostevensit13h278\n\nMy understanding is that the amount of ethanol we're taking about here on a\ndaily basis constitutes something like the amount you'd get eating an extra\npiece of fruit or so. Though I don't know where I originally saw the estimate\nor if it is good. Does anyone want to do some fermi estimates?\n\nReply\n\n[-]Lao Mein12h250\n\nThis is from the Google Doc FAQ.\n\nIt's bad for a bunch of reasons. Firstly, the rate of metabolism decreases as\npH decreases - and the main product was lactic acid, which decreases pH.\nSecond, they only considered bacteria in saliva. There are far more bacteria\nattached to your epithelium and teeth than there are in your saliva, since you\nswallow your saliva several times a minute.\n\nFinally, there's the fact that the entire reason this project exists is to\nchange the product of sugar fermentation from lactic acid to ethanol in order\nto prevent tooth decay. Lactic acid can only cause tooth decay if local pH is\nbelow 5.5. A similar amount of ethanol would be ~2% by mass. I'm pretty sure\nAFR people who only drink beer still have an elevated oral cancer risk. And\nthat's with only a few minutes of exposure a day! Consider what would happen\nif someone had that level of exposure every time they ate any carbs.\n\nReply1\n\n[-]romeostevensit2h20\n\nThanks! This is much closer to the amount of ethanol you'd get eating 50\nbananas a day. That's at least one sanity check it fails then, even under\nthese ideal conditions since, as you noted, there is probably a larger\nbacteria population than what was measured there.\n\nReply\n\n[-]lc10h110\n\nAs a useless anecdote, I took Lumina in November of last year. I generally\ndrink a lot, and have commented on hangovers getting 2-4x worse in the past\nfew months to friends, before reading this post or knowing anything about your\nhypothesis. This has occurred only in the last few months and I'm 24 years\nold.\n\nReply\n\n[-]Lao Mein10h51\n\nIt might have conditioned your oral and gut flora to break down ethanol into\nacetaldehyde faster. I'll have a follow-up piece on hangovers and AFR coming\nsoon, but the short of it is that certain antacids taken before drinking may\nhelp by decreasing ethanol first pass metabolism.\n\nReply\n\n[-]GeneSmith4h30\n\nInteresting. I took Lumina around December and have noticed no change, though\nI don't think I've actually been hungover during that time period. I\ndefinitely didn't notice any difference in the AMOUNT needed to produce a\nhangover; I drunk a substantial amount and didn't get hangovers any more\neasily.\n\nReply\n\n[-]Cesare12h1110\n\nI'm not convinced. The amounts of alcohol involved are very small and people\nwith this deficiency are not told to stay away from alcohol no matter what.\n\nI don't think the comparison with lactic acid is adequate - alcohol is a much\nmore common substance, which is present in small concentration basically\neverywhere. I just think that the quantity is very small to matter, even with\nthe \"local\" argument.\n\nReply\n\n[-]Lao Mein10h70\n\nEthanol is mostly harmless, but acetaldehyde is a potent carcinogen.\n\nReply\n\n[-]bruberu5h100\n\nI looked a little into the literature on how much alcohol consumption actually\naffects rates of oral cancers in populations with ALDH polymorphism, and this\nparticular study seems to be helpful in modelling how the likelihood of oral\ncancer increases with alcohol consumption for this group of people (found in\nthis meta-analysis).\n\nThe specific categories of drinking frequency don't seem to be too nice here,\ngiven that it was split between drinking <=4 days a week, drinking >=5 days a\nweek and having less than 46g of ethanol per week, and drinking >=5 days a\nweek and having more than 46g of ethanol per week. Only in the latter category\nwas there an actual significant increase in oral cancer rates (4.4x), although\nthere is some non-significant evidence for about a 1.5x increase in the high-\nmoderate group and the moderate group. Comparing the ~77 mg/week ingestion\nrate from the document to the 10-40g range I would estimate the high-moderate\ngroup to have, I would imagine that there is probably a much more minor effect\nfor Lumina (if I had to estimate, maybe like a 1.1x risk, which might be\noffset by the benefits of lower levels of lactic acid at that level).\n\nOne other argument against this (which I would put a lower epistemic status on\ngiven my basic intuition of enzyme kinetics) would be that since people\nprobably tend to have more than 10 milligrams of alcohol every time they have\na gulp of an alcoholic beverage, ALDH2 deficiency would be much more of a\nbottleneck as acetaldehyde levels rise rapidly after consuming alcohol\ncompared to the rather low background generation of acetaldehyde we might see\nfor Lumina users.\n\nAs I am being slightly a \"man of one study\" here, I'd be interested to see if\nyou've found any studies of your own that demonstrate more of an effect of\nalcohol consumption on oral cancer for ALDH2 deficiency than I've been listing\nhere.\n\nReply\n\n[-]Lao Mein4h50\n\nThe Alcohol Flushing Response: An Unrecognized Risk Factor for Esophageal\nCancer from Alcohol Consumption - PMC (nih.gov)\n\nThere are a lot of studies to regarding the assocation between ALDH2\ndeficiency and oral cancer risk. I think part of the issue is that\n\n  1. AFR people are less likely to become alcoholics, or to drink alcohol at all.\n  2. Japanese in particular have a high proportion of ALDH2 polymorphism, leading to subclinical but still biologically significant levels of acetaldehyde increase after drinking among the non-AFR group.\n  3. Drinking even small amounts of alcohol when you have AFR is really really bad for cancer risk.\n  4. Note that ALDH2 deficiency homozygotes would have the highest levels of post-drinking acetaldehyde but have the lowest levels of oral cancer because almost none of them drink. As in, out of ~100 homozygotes, only 2 were recorded as light drinkers, and none as heavy drinkers. This may be survival bias as the definition of heavy drinking may literally kill them.\n  5. The source for #4 looks like a pretty good meta-study, but some of the tables are off by one for some reason. Might just be on my end.\n  6. ADH polymorphism is also pretty common in Asian populations, generally in the direction of increased activity. This results in faster conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde, but often isn't included in these studies. This isn't really relevant for this discussion though.\n\nAs always, biostatistics is hard! If X causes less drinking, drinking\ncontributes to cancer, and X increases drinking's effects on cancer, X may\nhave positive, neutral, or negative overall correlation with cancer. Most\nstudies I've looked at had a pretty string correlation between ALDH2\ndeficiency and cancer though, especially after you control for alcohol\nconsumption.\n\nIt also looks like most researchers in the field think the relationship is\ncausal, with plausible mechanisms.\n\nReply\n\n[-]Seth Herd14h40\n\nI certainly agree that I'd hold off until I knew the answers to a bunch more\nquestions.\n\nThis all seems to rest on the relative increase in oral and esophygeal cancer.\n10x sounds like an awful lot. But in terms of decision-making, the absolute\nincrease, not the ratio, is the bottom line. So: what are the absolute\nlikelihoods? If they're both miniscule, this might not be a deciding factor.\nIncreasing my cancer risk by one in a million might be a good trade for\nimmunity to cavities and gum disease.\n\nIf you throw in immunity to bad breath, I'd take that deal. I wonder how large\na factor the alcohol vs lactic acid is in bad breath.\n\nI think it's also worth considering how much ethanol is excreted into the\nmouth by these bacteria relative to how much in the mouth of a heavy drinker.\nI'm sure the frequency vs. persistance is also a factor, but I'm not sure how.\n\nOn the other hand, if those numbers are much higher, it's possible that even\nthose without ALDH deficiency shouldn't take the treatment.\n\nReply\n\n[-]npostavs9h72\n\n> a good trade for immunity to cavities and gum disease.\n\n> If you throw in immunity to bad breath\n\nFYI, https://www.luminaprobiotic.com/faq says\n\n> This strain doesn't do anything to protect against gum disease, or bad\n> breath.\n\nReply\n\n[-]ryan_greenblatt4h80\n\nDoes it?
