Yet\nAGI, which could emerge soon, remains an elusive and controversial concept. We\nlack a clear definition of what it is, we don\u2019t know how we will detect it,\nand we don\u2019t know how to deal with it if it finally emerges.\n\nWhat we do know, however, is that today\u2019s approaches to studying AGI are not\nnearly rigorous enough. Within industry, where many of today\u2019s AI\nbreakthroughs are happening, companies like OpenAI are actively striving to\ncreate AGI, but include research on AGI\u2019s social dimensions and safety issues\nonly as their corporate leaders see fit. While the academic community looks at\nAGI more broadly, seeking the characteristics of a new intelligent life form,\nacademic institutions don\u2019t have the resources for a significant effort.\n\nThinking about AGI calls to mind another poorly understood and speculative\nphenomenon with the potential for transformative impacts on humankind. We\nbelieve that the SETI Institute\u2019s efforts to detect advanced extraterrestrial\nintelligence demonstrate several valuable concepts that can be adapted for AGI\nresearch. Instead of taking a dogmatic or sensationalist stance, the SETI\nproject takes a scientifically rigorous and pragmatic approach\u2014putting the\nbest possible mechanisms in place for the definition, detection, and\ninterpretation of signs of possible alien intelligence.\n\nThe idea behind SETI goes back sixty years to the beginning of the space age.\nIn their 1959 Nature paper, the physicists Giuseppe Cocconi and Philip\nMorrison described the need to search for interstellar communication. Assuming\nthe uncertainty of extraterrestrial civilizations\u2019 existence and technological\nsophistication, they theorized about how an alien society would try to\ncommunicate and discussed how we should best \u201clisten\u201d for messages. Inspired\nby this position, we argue for a similar approach to studying AGI, in all its\nuncertainties.\n\nAI researchers are still debating how probable it is that AGI will emerge and\nhow to detect it. However, the challenges in defining AGI and the difficulties\nin measuring it are not a justification for ignoring it or for taking a \u201cwe\u2019ll\nknow when we see it\u201d approach. On the contrary, these issues strengthen the\nneed for an interdisciplinary approach to AGI detection, evaluation, and\npublic education, including a science-based approach to the risks associated\nwith AGI.\n\n# We need a SETI-like approach to AGI now\n\nThe last few years have shown a vast leap in AI capabilities. The large\nlanguage models (LLMs) that power chatbots like ChatGPT, which can converse\nconvincingly with humans, have renewed the discussion about AGI. For example,\nrecent articles have stated that ChatGPT shows \u201csparks\u201d of AGI, is capable of\nreasoning, and outperforms humans in many evaluations.\n\nWhile these claims are intriguing and exciting, there are reasons to be\nskeptical. In fact, a large group of scientists argue that the current set of\ntools won\u2019t bring us any closer to true AGI. But given the risks associated\nwith AGI, if there is even a small likelihood of it occurring, we must make a\nserious effort to develop a standard definition of AGI, establish a SETI-like\napproach to detecting it, and devise ways to safely interact with it if it\nemerges.\n\n# Challenge 1: How to define AGI\n\nThe crucial first step is to define what exactly to look for. In SETI\u2019s case,\nresearchers decided to look for so-called narrow-band signals distinct from\nother radio signals present in the cosmic background. These signals are\nconsidered intentional and only produced by intelligent life.\n\nIn the case of AGI, matters are far more complicated. Today, there is no clear\ndefinition of \u201cartificial general intelligence\u201d (other terms, such as strong\nAI, human-level intelligence, and superintelligence are also widely used to\ndescribe similar concepts). The term is hard to define because it contains\nother imprecise and controversial terms. Although \u201cintelligence\u201d is defined in\nthe Oxford Dictionary as \u201cthe ability to acquire and apply knowledge and\nskills,\u201d there is still much debate on which skills are involved and how they\ncan be measured. The term \u201cgeneral\u201dis also ambiguous. Does an AGI need to be\nable to do everything a human can do? Is generality a quality we measure as a\nbinary or continuous variable?\n\nOne of the first missions of a \u201cSETI for AGI\u201d construct must be to clearly\ndefine the terms \u201cgeneral\u201d and \u201cintelligence\u201d so the research community can\nspeak about them concretely and consistently. These definitions need to be\ngrounded in the disciplines supporting the AGI concept, such as computer\nscience, measurement science, neuroscience, psychology, mathematics,\nengineering, and philosophy. Once we have clear definitions of these terms,\nwe\u2019ll need to find ways to measure them.\n\nThere\u2019s also the crucial question of whether a true AGI must include\nconsciousness, personhood, and self-awareness. These terms also have multiple\ndefinitions, and the relationships between them and intelligence must be\nclarified. Although it\u2019s generally thought that consciousness isn\u2019t necessary\nfor intelligence, it\u2019s often intertwined with discussions of AGI because\ncreating a self-aware machine would have many philosophical, societal, and\nlegal implications. Would a new large language model that can answer an IQ\ntest better than a human be as important to detect as a truly conscious\nmachine?\n\nGetty Images\n\n# Challenge 2: How to measure AGI\n\nIn the case of SETI, if a candidate narrow-band signal is detected, an expert\ngroup will verify that it is indeed an extraterrestrial source. They\u2019ll use\nestablished criteria\u2014for example, looking at the signal type and source and\nchecking for repetition\u2014and conduct all the assessments at multiple facilities\nfor additional validation.\n\nHow to best measure computer intelligence has been a long-standing question in\nthe field. In a famous 1950 paper, Alan Turing proposed the \u201cimitation game,\u201d\nnow more widely known as the Turing Test, which assesses whether human\ninterlocutors can distinguish if they are chatting with a human or a machine.\nAlthough the Turing Test has been useful for evaluations in the past, the rise\nof LLMs has made it clear that it\u2019s not a complete enough test to measure\nintelligence. As Turing noted in his paper, the imitation game does an\nexcellent job of testing if a computer can imitate the language-generation\nprocess, but the relationship between imitating language and thinking is still\nan open question. Other techniques will certainly be needed.\n\nThese appraisals must be directed at different dimensions of intelligence.\nAlthough measures of human intelligence are controversial, IQ tests can\nprovide an initial baseline to assess one dimension. In addition, cognitive\ntests on topics such as creative problem-solving, rapid learning and\nadaptation, reasoning, goal-directed behavior, and self-awareness would be\nrequired to assess the general intelligence of a system.\n\nThese cognitive tests will be useful, but it\u2019s important to remember that they\nwere designed for humans and might contain certain assumptions about basic\nhuman capabilities that might not apply to computers, even those with AGI\nabilities. For example, depending on how it\u2019s trained, a machine may score\nvery high on an IQ test but remain unable to solve much simpler tasks. In\naddition, the AI may have other communication modalities and abilities that\nwould not be measurable by our traditional tests.\n\nThere\u2019s a clear need to design novel evaluations to measure AGI or its sub-\ndimensions accurately. This process would also require a diverse set of\nresearchers from different fields who deeply understand AI, are familiar with\nthe currently available tests, and have the competency, creativity, and\nforesight to design novel tests. These measurements will hopefully alert us\nwhen meaningful progress is made toward AGI.\n\nOnce we have developed a standard definition of AGI and developed\nmethodologies to detect it, we must devise a way to address its emergence.\n\n# Challenge 3: How to deal with AGI\n\nOnce we have discovered this new form of intelligence, we must be prepared to\nanswer questions such as: Is the newly discovered intelligence a new form of\nlife? What kinds of rights does it have? What kinds of rights do we have\nregarding this intelligence? What are the potential safety concerns, and what\nis our approach to handling the AGI entity, containing it, and safeguarding\nourselves from it?\n\nHere, too, SETI provides inspiration. SETI has protocols for handling the\nevidence of a sign of extraterrestrial intelligence. SETI\u2019s post-detection\nprotocols emphasize validation, transparency, and cooperation with the United\nNations, with the goal of maximizing the credibility of the process,\nminimizing sensationalism, and bringing structure to such a profound event.\n\nAs with extraterrestrial intelligence, we need protocols for safe and secure\ninteractions with AGI. These AGI protocols would serve as the internationally\nrecognized framework for validating emergent AGI properties, bringing\ntransparency to the entire process, ensuring international cooperation,\napplying safety-related best practices, and handling any ethical, social, and\nphilosophical concerns.\n\nWe readily acknowledge that the SETI analogy can only go so far. If AGI\nemerges, it will be a human-made phenomenon. We will likely gradually engineer\nAGI and see it slowly emerge, so detection might be a process that takes place\nover a period of years, if not decades. In contrast, the existence of\nextraterrestrial life is something that we have no control over, and contact\ncould happen very suddenly.\n\nThe discovery of a true AGI would be the most profound development in the\nhistory of science, and its consequences would be also entirely unpredictable.\nTo best prepare, we need a methodical, comprehensive, principled, and\ninterdisciplinary approach to defining, detecting, and dealing with AGI. With\nSETI as an inspiration, we propose that the AGI research community establish a\nsimilar framework to ensure an unbiased, scientific, transparent, and\ncollaborative approach to dealing with possibly the most important development\nin human history.\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * World Builders Put Happy Face On Superintelligent AI \u203a\n  * The AI Apocalypse: A Scorecard \u203a\n\nRelated Articles Around the Web\n\n  * Planning for AGI and beyond | OpenAI \u203a\n\nartificial general intelligencelarge language modelsseti instituteturing\ntestconsciousnessextraterrestrial life\n\nEdmon Begoli\n\nis the founding director of Oak Ridge National Lab's new Center for AI\nSecurity Research, where he co-leads ORNL's internal AI research initiative\nwith focus on AI safety and security applications.
