B-theorists argue that the flow of time is only a subjective illusion of\nhuman consciousness, that the past, present, and future are equally real, and\nthat time is tenseless: temporal becoming is not an objective feature of\nreality. Therefore, there is nothing privileged about the present,\nontologically speaking.^[1]\n\nThe B-theory is derived from a distinction drawn by J. M. E. McTaggart between\nA series and B series. The B-theory is often drawn upon in theoretical\nphysics,^[2] and is seen in theories such as eternalism.\n\n## Origin of terms[edit]\n\nThe terms A-theory and B-theory, first coined by Richard Gale in 1966,^[3]\nderive from Cambridge philosopher J. M. E. McTaggart's analysis of time and\nchange in \"The Unreality of Time\" (1908), in which events are ordered via a\ntensed A-series or a tenseless B-series. It is popularly assumed that the A\ntheory represents time like an A-series, while the B theory represents time\nlike a B-series.^[4] The terms A and B theory are sometimes used as synonyms\nto the terms presentism and eternalism, but arguably^[original\nresearch?]^[citation needed] presentism does not represent time being like an\nA-series since it denies that there is a future and past in which events can\nbe located.\n\nEvents (or \"times\"), McTaggart observed, may be characterized in two distinct\nbut related ways. On the one hand they can be characterized as past, present\nor future, normally indicated in natural languages such as English by the\nverbal inflection of tenses or auxiliary adverbial modifiers. Alternatively,\nevents may be described as earlier than, simultaneous with, or later than\nothers. Philosophers are divided as to whether the tensed or tenseless mode of\nexpressing temporal fact is fundamental.^[4] Some philosophers have criticised\nhybrid theories, where one holds a tenseless view of time but asserts that the\npresent has special properties, as falling foul of McTaggart's paradox.^[5]\nFor a thorough discussion of McTaggart's paradox, see R. D. Ingthorsson\n(2016).^[6]\n\nThe debate between A-theorists and B-theorists is a continuation of a\nmetaphysical dispute reaching back to the ancient Greek philosophers\nHeraclitus and Parmenides.^[1]^[7] Parmenides thought that reality is timeless\nand unchanging.^[8] Heraclitus, in contrast, believed that the world is a\nprocess of ceaseless change or flux.^[9] Reality for Heraclitus is dynamic and\nephemeral. Indeed, the world is so fleeting, according to Heraclitus, that it\nis impossible to step twice into the same river.^[10] The metaphysical issues\nthat continue to divide A-theorists and B-theorists concern the reality of the\npast, the reality of the future, and the ontological status of the present.\n\n## B-theory in metaphysics[edit]\n\nThe difference between A-theorists and B-theorists is often described as a\ndispute about temporal passage or 'becoming' and 'progressing'. B-theorists\nargue that this notion is purely psychological.^[11] Many A-theorists argue\nthat in rejecting temporal 'becoming', B-theorists reject time's most vital\nand distinctive characteristic.^[12] It is common (though not universal) to\nidentify A-theorists' views with belief in temporal passage.^[4] Another way\nto characterise the distinction revolves around what is known as the principle\nof temporal parity, the thesis that contrary to what appears to be the case,\nall times really exist in parity^[definition needed]. A-theory (and especially\npresentism) denies that all times exist in parity, while B-theory insists all\ntimes exist in parity.^[13]^[6]\n\nB-theorists such as D. H. Mellor^[14] and J. J. C. Smart^[15] wish to\neliminate all talk of past, present and future in favour of a tenseless\nordering of events, believing the past, present, and future to be equally\nreal, opposing the idea that they are irreducible foundations of temporality.\nB-theorists also argue that the past, present, and future feature very\ndifferently in deliberation and reflection. For example, we remember the past\nand anticipate the future, but not vice versa. B-theorists maintain that the\nfact that we know much less about the future simply reflects an\nepistemological difference between the future and the past: the future is no\nless real than the past; we just know less about it.^[16]\n\n## B-theory in theoretical physics[edit]\n\nThe B-theory of time has received support from physicists.^[17]^[18] This is\nlikely due to its compatibility with physics and the fact that many theories\nsuch as special relativity, the ADD model, and brane cosmology, point to a\ntheory of time similar to B-theory.\n\nIn special relativity, the relativity of simultaneity shows that there is no\nunique present, and that each point in the universe can have a different set\nof events that are in its present moment.\n\nMany of special relativity's now-proven counterintuitive predictions, such as\nlength contraction and time dilation, are a result of this. Relativity of\nsimultaneity is often taken to imply eternalism (and hence a B-theory of\ntime), where the present for different observers is a time slice of the four-\ndimensional universe. This is demonstrated in the Rietdijk\u2013Putnam argument and\nin Roger Penrose's advanced form of this argument, the Andromeda paradox.^[19]\n\nIt is therefore common (though not universal) for B-theorists to be four-\ndimensionalists, that is, to believe that objects are extended in time as well\nas in space and therefore have temporal as well as spatial parts. This is\nsometimes called a time-slice ontology.^[20]\n\n## Opposition[edit]\n\n### Irreducibility of tense[edit]\n\nEarlier B-theorists argued that one could paraphrase tensed sentences (such as\n\"the sun is now shining\", uttered on September 28) into tenseless sentences\n(such as \"on September 28, the sun shines\") without loss of meaning.^[21]^[22]\nLater B-theorists argued that tenseless sentences could give the truth\nconditions of tensed sentences or their tokens.^[23]^[24] Quentin Smith argues\nthat \"now\" cannot be reduced to descriptions of dates and times, because all\ndate and time descriptions, and therefore truth conditionals, are relative to\ncertain events. Tensed sentences, on the other hand, do not have such truth\nconditionals.^[25] The B-theorist could argue that \"now\" is reducible to a\ntoken-reflexive phrase such as \"simultaneous with this utterance\", yet Smith\nstates that even such an argument fails to eliminate tense. One can think the\nstatement \"I am not uttering anything now\", and such a statement would be\ntrue. The statement \"I am not uttering anything simultaneous with this\nutterance\" is self-contradictory, and cannot be true even when one thinks the\nstatement.^[26] Finally, while tensed statements can express token-independent\ntruth values, no token-reflexive statement can do so (by definition of the\nterm \"token-reflexive\").^[27] Smith claims that proponents of the B-theory\nargue that the inability to translate tensed sentences into tenseless\nsentences does not prove A-theory.^[28]\n\nLogician and philosopher Arthur Prior has also drawn a distinction between\nwhat he calls A-facts and B-facts. The latter are facts about tenseless\nrelations, such as the fact that the year 2025 is 25 years later than the year\n2000. The former are tensed facts, such as that the Jurassic age is in the\npast, or that the end of the universe is in the future. Prior asks the reader\nto imagine having a headache, and after the headache subsides, saying \"thank\ngoodness that's over.\" Prior argues that the B-theory cannot make sense of\nthis sentence. It seems bizarre to be thankful that a headache is earlier than\none's utterance, anymore than being thankful that the headache is later than\none's utterance. Indeed, most people who say \"thank goodness that's over\" are\nnot even thinking of their own utterance. Therefore, when people say \"thank\ngoodness that's over,\" they are thankful for an A-fact, and not a B-fact. Yet,\nA-facts are only possible on the A-theory of time.^[29] (See also: Further\nfacts.)\n\n### Endurantism and perdurantism[edit]\n\nOpponents also charge the B-theory with being unable to explain persistence of\nobjects. The two leading explanations for this phenomenon are endurantism and\nperdurantism. According to the former, an object is wholly present at every\nmoment of its existence. According to the latter, objects are extended in time\nand therefore have temporal parts.^[30]^[31] Hales and Johnson explain\nendurantism as follows: \"something is an enduring object only if it is wholly\npresent at each time in which it exists. An object is wholly present at a time\nif all of its parts co-exist at that time.\"^[32] Under endurantism, all\nobjects must exist as wholes at each point in time, but an object such as a\nrotting fruit will have the property of being not rotten one day and being\nrotten on another. On eternalism, and hence the B-theory, it seems that one is\ncommitted to two conflicting states for the same object.^[30] The spacetime\n(Minkowskian) interpretation of relativity adds an additional problem for\nendurantism under B-theory. On the spacetime interpretation, an object may\nappear as a whole at its rest frame, but on an inertial frame, it will have\nproper parts at different positions, and therefore different parts at\ndifferent times. Hence it will not exist as a whole at any time, contradicting\nendurantism.^[33]\n\nOpponents will then charge perdurantism with numerous difficulties of its own.\nFirst, it is controversial whether perdurantism can be formulated coherently.\nAn object is defined as a collection of spatiotemporal parts, defined as\npieces of a perduring object. If objects have temporal parts, this leads to\ndifficulties. For example, the rotating discs argument asks the reader to\nimagine a world containing nothing more than a homogeneous spinning disk.\nUnder endurantism, the same disc endures despite its rotations. The\nperdurantist supposedly has a difficult time explaining what it means for such\na disc to have a determinate state of rotation.^[34] Temporal parts also seem\nto act unlike physical parts. A piece of chalk can be broken into two physical\nhalves, but it seems nonsensical to talk about breaking it into two temporal\nhalves.^[35] Chisholm argued that someone who hears the bird call \"Bob White\"\nknows \"that his experience of hearing 'Bob' and his experience of hearing\n'White' were not also had by two other things, each distinct from himself and\nfrom each other. The endurantist can explain the experience as \"There exists\nan x such that x hears 'Bob' and then x hears 'White'\" but the perdurantist\ncannot give such an account.^[36] Peter van Inwagen asks the reader to\nconsider Descartes as a four-dimensional object that extends from 1596 to\n1650. If Descartes had lived a much shorter life, he would have had a\nradically different set of temporal parts. This diminished Descartes, he\nargues, could not have been the same person on perdurantism, since their\ntemporal extents and parts are so different.^[37]\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Craig, W.
