Airlines will have to ensure that a minimum proportion of\nfuel burned is certified sustainable in the coming decade, with the EU\nmandating at least 20% SAF by 2035, and the UK expected soon to announce a\nmandatory 10% by 2030.\n\nThere are various ways of making SAF but most are much more expensive than\nnormal kerosene jet fuel, with a limited supply of waste feedstocks such as\nused cooking oil.\n\nFirefly\u2019s chief operations officer, Paul Hilditch, said converted sewage\nshould be cheaper and more abundant, providing up to 5% of airlines\u2019 fuel\nneeds in the UK. The process uses biosolids, the water industry term for the\nfinal product in the treatment process. \u201cIt\u2019s crumbly \u2013 like compost or wet\nchocolate cake,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s millions of tonnes of the stuff. And it has\nno intrinsic value.\u201d\n\nThe company has produced small test quantities of SAF that he said were\n\u201cchemically indistinguishable\u201d from jet fuel, with a residue that can be used\nas a soil enhancer. The fuel is still in a regulatory testing process, and\nFirefly is still to secure the investment it needs to build a full-scale\nfactory.\n\nHowever, its chief executive, James Hygate, said it was confident it could be\ndelivering commercial supplies of SAF by 2028-29. He said the first facility\nin Harwich would serve London airports and there was potential for two more in\nthe UK.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re turning sewage into jet fuel and I can\u2019t think of many things that are\ncooler than that,\u201d he commented.\n\nWizz Air\u2019s corporate and ESG officer, Yvonne Moynihan, said: \u201cAlongside fleet\nrenewal and operational efficiency, SAF plays a crucial role in reducing\ncarbon emissions from aviation.\u201d\n\nShe said Wizz\u2019s investment in Firefly was a \u201cperfect pair-up for a low-cost\nairline\u201d and the carrier aspired to use 10% SAF across its entire operation by\n2030, although it would need \u201ca significant ramp-up of production and\ndeployment\u201d.\n\nThe UK government has said it expects five commercial plants to produce SAF in\nthe UK to be under construction by 2025. However, campaigners have said even\nusing human waste for aviation was not truly sustainable.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Business Today\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and\nanalysis you need every morning\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

It\u2019s another\nconundrum.\u201d\n\nAbout 87% of UK water companies\u2019 biosolids are currently spread on farmland.\nCait Hewitt, of the Aviation Environment Foundation, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not to be\nsniffed at, given that this is truly unavoidable waste, but not great either\ngiven it\u2019s already in use as fertiliser.\u201d\n\nShe said any test for the carbon credentials of alternative fuels should ask:\n\u201cHas the producer done something to draw down additional CO_2 from the\natmosphere? Otherwise it\u2019s nothing near a net zero solution.\u201d\n\nHilditch said the use of biosolids for muckspreading on farms was of low\nvalue, and the residue from the sewage-to-fuel process would still be\navailable to improve soil.\n\nMany other countries simply incinerated human waste, meaning that converting\nit to jet fuel could also have other benefits in terms of efficient disposal,\nhe added. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the UK of course. Anywhere in the world where there\nare people, there\u2019s poo.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Airline industry\n  * Airline emissions\n  * Energy\n  * Bristol\n  * Air transport\n  * Travel and transport\n  * Travel & leisure\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Airlines hope that sustainable fuels will propel them to a guilt-free future\n\n10 Jun 2023\n\n  * ### Airlines warn of higher fares as industry moves to net zero target\n\n6 Dec 2022\n\n  * ### E-fuels: how big a niche can they carve out for cars?\n\n5 May 2023\n\n  * ### Electric planes sound like a fantasy but they may be the future for short-haul in Australia\n\n8 Jan 2023\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncomments\n\n  * ### Airlines need to do more than plant trees to hit net zero, MPs told\n\n22 Jul 2021\n\n  * ### \u2018They said we were eccentrics\u2019: the UK team developing clean aviation fuel\n\n14 Aug 2021\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Environment\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Wildlife\n  * Energy\n  * Pollution\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
