These tests have \u201calways been one of the\nremaining gaping holes in the FDA regulatory structure. And it\u2019s great to see\nthat the agency has taken concrete steps to close it.\u201d\n\n### Get Our Top Investigations\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nThanks for signing up.

Because these tests are designed, manufactured and used in a single\nlab, they escape most federal oversight over marketing and accuracy.\n\nA large coalition of labs, associations and academic medical centers have long\npushed back on the prospect of increased FDA involvement in these tests. It\nwould be too onerous, they\u2019ve argued, and it jeopardizes patient access to\nhealth services.\n\nOne of nearly 7,000 comments submitted in response to the draft rule came from\nthe Association for Molecular Pathology, representing a wide-ranging group of\nprofessionals associated with laboratory testing. The FDA\u2019s proposed changes\n\u201cwould result in laboratory professionals being treated as product\nmanufacturers instead of board-certified healthcare providers,\u201d the\nassociation\u2019s president wrote, and it would \u201cunequivocally hinder and harm\npatient care.\u201d\n\nThe agency\u2019s hands-off approach dates back to an era when these tests were a\nrelatively small, low-risk sector of the health care system. Now, they are a\nmuch bigger player and include high-stakes tests made by commercial companies.\nWhile the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reviews lab operations,\nit doesn\u2019t check whether the tests themselves are clinically valid. The tests\naren\u2019t registered with the federal government, so nobody knows how many exist.\nIn 2021, Pew Charitable Trusts estimated that 12,000 labs are likely to deploy\nthem, many of which process thousands a day.\n\nThe ProPublica story on prenatal genetic screenings referenced by the FDA\nrevealed how the agency didn\u2019t check the tests before they reached patients or\nevaluate marketing claims made by the companies that sell them. Companies\naren\u2019t required to publicly report when a test gets it wrong, the\ninvestigation found, and no federal agency can recall faulty screenings. The\nstory detailed how false positives, false negatives and indeterminate results\ncan have painful consequences for expecting parents. (We also published a\nguide to the prenatal tests to help families with their questions.)\n\nOur coronavirus investigation showed how a Chicago-based company with state\nand local contracts in Nevada sold testing services that were unreliable from\nthe start. As it became clear that the lab was telling infected people that\nthey had tested negative for the virus, company officials nonetheless expanded\nthe reach of the lab\u2019s testing. The company declined to comment for\nProPublica\u2019s previous stories on these problems.\n\nThe rule will go into effect over a four-year period. Within two years, test-\nmakers will be expected to meet registration and listing requirements, among\nothers, which is \u201ca critical part of this rule,\u201d according to Cara Tenenbaum,\na former FDA policy adviser whose consultancy has advocated for more active\noversight.\n\n\u201cAt least knowing what is out there will be huge,\u201d she said in an email.\n\nHigh-risk tests will need to meet new FDA review requirements before reaching\nthe marketplace starting in November 2027. Moderate-risk and low-risk tests\nwill need to do the same starting in May 2028. It\u2019s unclear how prenatal\nscreening tests would be categorized.\n\nThe agency generally will not enforce some or all requirements for certain\nLDTs, including tests that were first marketed before the rule was issued and\nhave not since been modified or have been modified in certain limited ways.\n\nThe agency will also generally not enforce some or all requirements for tests\nused within the Veterans Health Administration or the Department of Defense,\nas well as certain tests that meet other narrow conditions.\n\nNonetheless, the rule marks a massive shift in the FDA\u2019s approach to a sector\nthat touches millions. \u201cThe agency cannot stand by while Americans continue to\nrely on results of these tests without assurance that they work,\u201d FDA\ncommissioner Robert Califf said in an agency news release.\n\nThe final rule, he added, aims to \u201chelp ensure that important health care\ndecisions are made based on test results that patients and health care\nproviders can trust.\u201d\n\nThe FDA tried to rein in the lab tests a decade ago, issuing a draft guidance\nin 2014. That prompted a two-year backlash from opponents. The agency\nultimately dropped it.\n\nSome critics have argued that regulation of LDTs should happen through\nlegislation rather than rulemaking. But many also largely opposed a bipartisan\nbill in 2022 that came the closest to passing before ultimately being dropped\nat the end of the year. Later efforts to move a similar bill forward have not\ngained traction in Congress.\n\nLaurie Menser, chief executive of the Association for Molecular Pathology,\nsaid in an emailed statement that the association is \u201cvery disappointed\u201d in\nthe new rule.\n\nRead More\n\nStates Across the Country Are Reforming Guardianship. New York Is Not One of\nThem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate the agency continues to overstep its authority and bypass\nthe country\u2019s legislative process,\u201d Menser said. \u201cAMP is currently reviewing\nthe different aspects of the rule and assessing the many implications for our\nmembers and patient care.\u201d\n\nLurie, who was closely involved with the FDA effort to address the tests a\ndecade ago, said the rule has been a long time coming. \u201cPeople had identified\nthis problem a very long time ago, and wanted to take action, but found\nthemselves stymied by opposition,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think that it shows real courage on the part of the agency, as well as\ncommitment to the public health, to take this step,\u201d he added.\n\nFiled under \u2014\n\n  * Health Care\n  * Regulation\n\nAnna Clark\n\nAnna Clark is a Detroit-based reporter for ProPublica, covering stories in\nMichigan and the Midwest.
