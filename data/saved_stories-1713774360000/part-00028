The development\nmarks an important step toward a possible space-based solar power station that\ncould help wean the world off fossil fuels amid the intensifying battle\nagainst climate change.\n\nSpeaking at the International Conference on Energy from Space, held here this\nweek, Koichi Ijichi, an adviser at the Japanese research institute Japan Space\nSystems, outlined Japan's road map toward an orbital demonstration of a\nminiature space-based solar power plant that will wirelessly transmit energy\nfrom low Earth orbit to Earth.\n\n\"It will be a small satellite, about 180 kilograms [400 pounds], that will\ntransmit about 1 kilowatt of power from the altitude of 400 kilometers [250\nmiles],\" Ijichi said at the conference.\n\nRelated: Space-based solar power may be one step closer to reality, thanks to\nthis key test (video)\n\nOne kilowatt is about the amount of power needed to run a household appliance,\nsuch as a small dishwasher, for about an hour, depending on its size.\nTherefore, the demonstration is nowhere near the scale required for commercial\nuse.\n\nThe spacecraft will use a 22-square-foot (2 square meters) onboard\nphotovoltaic panel to charge a battery. The accumulated energy will then be\ntransformed into microwaves and beamed toward a receiving antenna on Earth.\nBecause the spacecraft travels very fast \u2014 around 17,400 mph (28,000 km/h) \u2014\nantenna elements will have to be spread over a distance of about 25 miles (40\nkm), spaced 3 miles (5 km) apart, to allow enough energy to be transmitted.\n\n\"The transmission will take only a few minutes,\" Ijichi said. \"But once the\nbattery is empty, it will take several days to recharge.\"\n\n## Get the Space.com Newsletter\n\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events\nand more!\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nThe mission, part of a project called OHISAMA (Japanese for \"sun\"), is on\ntrack for launch in 2025. The researchers have already demonstrated wireless\ntransmission of solar power on the ground from a stationary source, and they\nplan to conduct a transmission from an aircraft in December. The aircraft will\nbe fitted with an identical photovoltaic panel as will be flown on the\nspacecraft and will beam down power over a distance of 3 to 4 miles (5 to 7\nkm), according to Ijichi.\n\n## From concept to reality\n\nSpace-based solar power generation, first described in 1968 by former Apollo\nengineer\n\nPeter Glaser, has been considered science fiction. Although theoretically\nfeasible, the technology has been seen as impractical and too costly, as it\nrequires enormous structures to be assembled in orbit to produce the required\npower output.\n\nBut according to the experts speaking at the conference, that situation has\nchanged as a result of recent technological advances and the urgency to\ndecarbonize the world's power supply to thwart climate change.\n\nUnlike most renewable power generation technologies used on Earth, including\nsolar power and wind energy, space-based solar power could be available\nconstantly, as it would not depend on weather and the time of the day.\nCurrently, nuclear power plants or gas- and coal-fired power stations are used\nto cover demand when the wind stops blowing or after sunset. Improvements in\ntechnology could help partially solve the problem in the future. But some\npieces of the puzzle are still missing to secure a seamless carbon-neutral\npower supply by the middle of this century as stipulated in international\nclimate change agreements.\n\nDevelopments in robotic technologies, improvements in the efficiency of\nwireless power transmission and, most importantly, the arrival of SpaceX's\ngiant rocket Starship could allow space-based solar power to become a reality,\nthe experts said at the conference.\n\nLast year, a satellite built by Caltech engineers as part of the Space Solar\nPower Demonstrator mission beamed solar power from space for the first time.\nThe mission, which concluded in January, was celebrated as a major milestone.\n\nMany more space-based solar power demonstration projects are in the pipeline.\nThe technology is studied by space and research agencies all over the world,\nincluding the European Space Agency, the Defense Advanced Research Projects\nAgency and the U.S. Air Force. Commercial companies and startups are also\ndeveloping concepts, harnessing the availability of Starship and the emergence\nof advanced space robotics.\n\nRelated Stories:\n\n\u2014Can space-based solar power really work?

In January, NASA released a report questioning the feasibility of the\ntechnology. The difficulty and amount of energy required to build, launch and\nassemble orbital power stations mean the energy they produce would be too\nexpensive \u2014 61 cents per kilowatt-hour, compared with as little as 5 cents per\nkilowatt-hour for Earth-based solar or wind energy.\n\nIn addition, the overall carbon footprint of the power production and the\namount of greenhouse gas emissions generated by rockets taking those\nassemblies into orbit make space-based solar power much less climate-friendly\nthan technologies used on Earth. For example, a gigawatt-scale spaceborne\nsolar power station, such as the CASSIOPeiA concept plant proposed by the U.K.\nfirm Space Solar, would need 68 Starships to get to space.\n\nJoin our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky\nand more!

Especially the receiving antenna if I\nunderstood correctly. Does the orbit need to be synced, or phased with antenna\nlocation? And maybe angle?\n\nI think I understand this concept, to replace fossil fuel. And eventually 24/7\nsolar power from space in the future. Unfortunately replacing fossil fuel is\nnot the problem. If we replaced all fossil fuel tomorrow............how are\nyou going to meet demand? And believe it or not, demand is just beginning.\n\nAnd to my way of thinking and I know I am weird, but reflecting sunlight to\nthis \"over-warmed planet\", is not a good idea. Solar would only be green is if\ncatches incident light.\n\nAs for space reflectors, if we could orientate(can) and focus(doubtful)\nsunlight, it might be useful for clearing our space debris. A focused beam\nshould illuminate the small stuff, maybe even accelerate/ionize it to de-\norbit. Cleaning up some of our mess might be done with light beams.\n\nReply\n\n  * Jan Steinman\n\n> One kilowatt is about the amount of power needed to run a household\n> appliance, such as a small dishwasher, for about an hour...\n\nYou're confusing power with energy.\n\nA kilowatt is a unit of power, or the instantaneous product of force and flow,\nsuch as 100 volts causing a current of ten amps. A kilowatt will power that\nappliance as long as the proper voltage is applied, not just an hour.\n\nA kilowatt-hour is a unit of energy, or power times duration. Running an\nelectric dish washer \u2014 plus an electric water heater for the diswasher's hot\nwater \u2014 for an hour will consume about a kilowatt-hour of energy.\n\nReply\n\n  * Alaintha\n\nReading this article, I kept thinking, what about the size, will they continue\nto expand and grow? Is one enough? I highly doubt one solar power plant will\nbe enough for most countries. How many other countries will copy this\nengineering feat and send one up on their own? This space power plant, how\nwill it be affected by \" space trash\" that falls to earth? What do repairs\ncost?\n\nI am not a scientist but I do love my telescope, watching the skies and my\nfavorite stars. Scientists have stated that the \"solar power\" equipment will\nappear as just a star, I disagree. What about the \"falling trash\" from\nrepairs? Or worse, thrown out of orbit from other space trash or some thing\nlarger than an a small meteorite ?\n\nAs science reaches for answers to accommodate the growth of Earth's\ninhabitants, how far will it go? I still have many questions about sending\nsolar power plants to supply beams down to us. If I live long enough, will\nEarth be entirely surrounded by not only satellites, but now space power\nplants vying for orbit? How far will this congestion grow?\n\nReply\n\n  * billslugg\n\nThe congestion will grow until the outcry pushes back. There is heated debate\ngoing on right now. I believe the environmental concerns around dosing any\nspot on the Earth with that much microwave radiation are going to scuttle it.\nFusion or thermal drilling will get there first.\n\nReply\n\n  * Kipi\n\nI think that solar energy collection in space will never be strategically\nfeasible as long as there is war between nations. If your entire (or most)\nenergy supply depends on such space structures, your enemy may easily\ncompromise you by destroying your photovoltaic station with one nuke or\nseveral conventional missiles. I think this will become (theoretically)\npossible only if humanity transcends war ( in other words don't hold your\nbreath waiting for this to happen).\n\nReply\n\n  * Unclear Engineer\n\nI agree with Kipi regarding the strategic implications of space based solar.\n\nHowever, the opposite is true for DISTRIBUTED ground based solar. If everybody\nhas the ability to work while off-grid, it would not be possible for an enemy\nto shut down the whole country's electrical system as Russia is currently\nseeming to try to do in Ukraine right now.\n\nReply\n\n  * Kipi\n\nI agree with UE in that the correct trend would be a gradual shift to\ndecentralized independent small units with as much diversification as\npossible, some solar, some wind, some hydroelectric, some geothermal and all\nshould be inter-linked into a more resilient system. However, it will take\nsome time and resources and scientific advances until this becomes a reality.\n\nReply\n\n  * Classical Motion\n\nHas any here seen recent photographs of Indian and Chinese cities? I spent a\nyear on the Mojave desert in 1969. LA never looked that bad. Can you imagine\n10 years from now with all that coal expansion? Geothermal is their only\nsolution. Without ventilators.\n\nDemand will bring inexpensive holes. The tech for generation is the same for\ncoal. And no future supply lines, storage or fees.\n\nMaybe even some year round creeks and wetlands in arid areas. Maybe even\nreplenish large desert lakes.\n\nReply\n\n##### Most Popular\n\nNASA's Juno probe captures amazing views of Jupiter's volcanic moon Io (video)\n\nNASA's Artemis 3 astronauts will put a moonquake detector on lunar surface\n\nIngenuity's travels: New NASA video tracks Mars helicopter's 72 flights\n\nPrivate space-junk probe to conduct up-close inspection of spent rocket stage\n\nWatch 'Devil Comet' approach the sun during explosive coronal mass ejection\n(video)\n\nJapanese satellite will beam solar power to Earth in 2025\n\nChina's experimental moon satellites beam back lunar imagery (video, photo)\n\nAre we prepared for Chinese preeminence on the moon and Mars?
