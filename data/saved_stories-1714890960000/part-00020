What do\nthe stars look like on Mars?\n\nWhat does the Sun look like? Would Mars even be a good place to do amateur\nastronomy?\n\nAt first glance the answer to this last question would be a resounding \u2018yes\u2019.\nFor a start there are very few cloudy nights on Mars.\n\nAn image showing sunset at Gusev Crater on Mars, captured by NASA's Spirit\nMars rover in 2005.

Credit: NASA/JPL-\nCaltech\n\nYou would see two moons - Phobos and Deimos - in the Mars night sky instead of\none.\n\nAnd there would be a lot less interference from satellites: it's likely to be\na long time before Mars\u2019s night sky is crawling with trains of Starlink\nsatellites.\n\nOn the downside, twilight lasts longer on Mars because of all the extra light-\nscattering dust in the air.\n\nThat same dusty atmosphere will also reduce the brightness and visibility of\nthe stars at low altitude, just as low-lying fog does here.\n\n## What the sky looks like from Mars\n\nA view of a total solar eclipse on Mars.

Credit:\nNASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nOn Mars, thanks to the dusty atmosphere, you would see a sunset dyed purple\nand blue, with the faraway Sun reduced to a shrunken blue coin before it set\nbehind the extinct volcanoes silhouetted on the horizon.\n\nPhotos taken by the Curiosity rover suggest that once the Sun had set there\u2019s\na good chance you would see streaks and curls of silvery-blue noctilucent\nclouds shining in the twilight, perhaps even a display putting anything seen\nin our own summer skies to shame.\n\nDepending on the time of year, you might also see an \u2018Evening Star\u2019 shining in\nthe lavender-hued twilight.\n\nNot Venus, but Earth, a strikingly-bright spark of silvery blue, which at its\nbest would blaze brighter than mag. \u20132.5.\n\nA view of Earth from Mars, appearing like the brightest star in the Martian\nsky.

Source: NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nIf Earth was showing a full or gibbous phase, through your telescope you would\nsee its familiar green continents and blue oceans on the dayside, and the\nlights of its cities glinting on the nightside.\n\nAnd just imagine what an incredible sight a crescent Earth would be through\nyour highest-powered eyepiece.\n\nAs the sky darkened, the stars in a Mars night sky would look reassuringly\nfamiliar. Mars is so close to Earth that none of the stars would look any\nbrighter or fainter than they do from Earth.\n\nAs there is no shift in parallax to rearrange the constellations into new\nshapes, you would still see Cassiopeia, Orion the Hunter, and all your other\nfavourites.\n\nRead our guides to the best winter constellations and the best summer\nconstellations.\n\nPerhaps future Martian explorers can stave off the homesickness with the sight\nof familiar constellations like the distinctive \u2018W\u2019 shape of Cassiopeia.\nCredit: Michael Breite/Stefan Heutz/Wolfgang Ries/ccdguide.com\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re a Martian you might know them by different names, or might\nhave totally different constellations altogether.\n\nNative-born Martians of the future will almost certainly re-draw the night sky\nto celebrate their own history and key figures.\n\nHowever, as you set up your telescope a problem would quickly present itself:\nMars has no \u2018North Star\u2019, like Polaris here on Earth, to align on.\n\nInstead, its axis of rotation points at an unremarkable area of sky close to\nAlderamin (Alpha (\u03b1) Cephei), the brightest star in Cepheus. Deneb (Alpha (\u03b1)\nCygni) is the closest bright star to Mars\u2019s northern celestial pole.\n\n## Observing the moons from Mars\n\nTwo separate images of Deimos (left) and Phobos (right) captured by NASA's\nMars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Image Credit: NASA/JPL-caltech/University of\nArizona\n\nOur Moon crawls relatively slowly across the heavens. In contrast, Mars\u2019s two\nmoons Phobos and Deimos move far more rapidly across the sky.\n\nTo the naked eye Phobos would resemble a pale pebble one third as wide as\nEarth\u2019s Moon, while Deimos would appear more like a bright star. It's also\nworth considering the unusual orbit of Deimos.\n\nBoth Martian moons would shine brightly enough to cast your shadow on the\nrocks and dust dunes around, as you watched them drift overhead.\n\nAnd, as the moons move across the Mars night sky, if you could keep them in\nyour telescope\u2019s field of view, it would reveal their irregular, lumpen shapes\nand largest craters.\n\nThe Curiosity rover captured this view of Martian moon Phobos passing directly\nin front of the Sun, as seen from the surface of Mars.

Although Mercury and Venus would\nbe fainter than they appear from Earth, Jupiter and Saturn would sometimes\nappear much brighter.\n\nWhen the two gas giants were at their closest to Mars both would show\nfascinating detail through your telescope.\n\nWith no light pollution or bright Moon to dim the Milky Way, it would be a\nspectacular sight from Mars.\n\nJust imagine standing on the crumbling edge of the great Valles Marineris, or\nthe lofty summit of towering Olympus Mons, and seeing the Milky Way painted\nacross the sky, stretching from horizon to horizon, its length clotted with\nfrothy star clouds.\n\n## Meteor showers on Mars\n\nThe Opportunity rover captured this view of Comet Siding Spring as it passed\nnear Mars on 19 October 2014. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/Cornell Univ./ASU/TAMU\n\nAs you stood there hypnotised by the beauty of the Milky Way you might see a\nmeteor zip across the sky. Despite Mars having quite a pathetic excuse for an\natmosphere, it is still thick enough to produce meteors.\n\nIf you had been standing beside Opportunity in 2014 when Mars passed through\nthe tail of Comet Siding Spring, you would have seen a display of shooting\nstars rivalling the famous Leonid storms of the past.\n\nSuch events are very rare of course, but research suggests Mars has its own\nmeteor showers, although they don\u2019t occur on the same dates as Earth\u2019s.\n\nMars rovers regularly find meteorites on the planet's surface. This space rock\nwas discovered by Curiosity on 30 October 2016. It's about the size of a golf\nball. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS\n\nIf you\u2019re a deep-sky observer you would also be able to see all your\nfavourites from Mars.\n\nHowever, your views of incredible sights such as the Orion Nebula, the\nAndromeda Galaxy and the Pleiades star cluster might be ruined by the fact\nthat it would be difficult to get close to your telescope eyepiece due to the\nbulky visor of your spacesuit helmet.\n\nEventually the sky would begin to brighten, a violet-blue glow spreading over\nthe eastern sky until the Sun burst over the horizon, flooding the landscape\nwith light.\n\nThe Martian stars would be snuffed out one by one, until only the brightest\nplanets remained, then they too would fade away, leaving the sky a blank,\norange-pink dome once more.\n\nAnd another Martian day would begin.\n\n## Doing astronomy and stargazing on Mars\n\nA simulated view of Halley\u2019s Comet and Earth from Mars. Credit: Pete Lawrence\n\nFuture amateur astronomers on Mars will have to be tough and resilient.\n\nThey might not have to cope with the frustration of cloudy nights like their\nterrestrial counterparts but they will have other, greater, challenges.\n\nFor a start, they will have to see and do everything cocooned inside a\nspacesuit protecting them from the inhospitable Martian environment.\n\nNight-time temperatures on Mars can drop to -90\u00b0C, so fingerless gloves and a\nwoolly hat are not going to be warm enough.\n\nEven before going outside to stargaze they will have to spend hours suiting up\nand then cycling through an airlock.\n\nOnce outside, the real challenges will begin. Sadly, there will be no escape\nfrom light pollution, even on Mars.\n\nBase camp could be an irritating source of light pollution for future\nstargazers on Mars! Credit: NASA\n\nStargazers will have to get away from light produced by the base, but not so\nfar away that their safety is put at risk.\n\nOnce their vision is dark-adapted they will have to view the starry sky\nthrough their helmet visors, which might distort the stars or affect their\ncolours.\n\nUsing binoculars or telescopes will be difficult for the same reason, although\nit is possible they might be able to use some sort of visor attachment to let\nthem look through the eyepieces of such observing equipment.\n\n## Astrophotography on Mars\n\nThe Moon occulting Mars, captured by Ricardo J. Vaz Tolentino, Belo Horizonte,\nBrazil, 6 September 2020. Will future astrophotographers be able to capture\nEarth occulting the Moon?\n\nAs for astrophotography, the DSLRs used back on Earth won\u2019t cut it on Mars.\n\nThese cameras aren\u2019t designed to be used in such a dusty and lethally cold\nenvironment, and would probably die within a few minutes of being put on their\ntripod.\n\nBut a camera specially designed to be used on Mars would take fantastic images\nof the stars, planets and Milky Way shining above the planet\u2019s jagged\nmountains, meandering canyons and towering volcanoes.\n\nPerhaps the winning image of the Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2061\ncompetition will be a twilight photo of Halley\u2019s Comet shining below Earth,\nhigh above the dust-covered Opportunity rover.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the February 2021 issue of BBC Sky at\nNight Magazine.\n\n## Share this article\n\nStuart Atkinson\n\nAstronomy writer\n\nStuart Atkinson is a lifelong amateur astronomer and an author of popular\nastronomy books.\n\nThis website is owned and published by Our Media Ltd. www.ourmedia.co.uk\n\n\u00a9 Our Media 2024\n\n", "frontpage": true}
