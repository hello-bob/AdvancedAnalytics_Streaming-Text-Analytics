So far, anyway. You've got a ship, some weapons, and\nenough spare cash to get started - and one day, you might get the fame, wealth\nor glory you want. Perhaps one day, everyone might know your name. If, that\nis, you can survive that long.\n\nThe two thousand star systems of the Cooperative once enjoyed a golden age of\npeace and prosperity, and perhaps the wealthiest of them can still pretend to.\nThe trade ships that once safely travelled between planets now have to be well\narmed and escorted to fend off pirate attacks, from small-time criminals\ndesperate for their next meal, to powerful robber barons extracting tithes\nfrom everyone who passes through their space.\n\nThe Cooperative's police force, concentrated near a few influential planets,\ncan no longer maintain order. The mercenaries they hire for a few credits a\nkill are too few, too unreliable to do so either. And in the darkness between\nthe stars, an old enemy lurks, fearless, perhaps waiting for order to collapse\nentirely.\n\nGood luck, Commander.\n\nOolite is inspired by the 8-bit classic Elite, and many aspects of gameplay\nwill be familiar to players of that game. In the tradition of open-world\ngames, there's no overall story: you can be a millionaire trader, a veteran\ncombateer, a feared pirate, a lonely miner, a notorious smuggler, or all of\nthem, or something else entirely, based on your own actions.\n\nFor those new to the game, the getting started page has some hints for\nbeginners to see you safely through your first flight, and suggests ways to\ncontinue in future.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of Oolite is customisation: almost all parts\nof the game can be modified using simple free text and graphics tools, and\nover a thousand expansion packs are available, ranging from minor tweaks such\nas a new ship or replacement sound effects, all the way up to adding complex\nsolar systems, navies or giant missions it could take you weeks to play\nthrough.\n\nOolite runs on Mac OS X (10.6 or later), Windows (Vista Service Pack 2 or\nlater), and Linux. It is designed not to need the latest hardware, and\nrequires only a 1GHz processor, 1GB of RAM, and an Open GL-capable graphics\ncard for basic performance (though a higher specification is recommended, and\nsome expansion packs may require a more modern computer).\n\nThe game and source code are freely available under the GNU General Public\nLicense.\n\n## Latest News...\n\nOur forums have moved and are fully up and running again!

Pre-\nReleases of the latest source are available for testers.\n\nWarning: these builds may at any time contain serious bugs, prototype\nfeatures, and other unstable code. We do not recommend these for regular play,\nand you should take backups of your saved games before using them.\n\nIf you would like to try out the latest code, and give us feedback on the new\nfeatures, then you can find the pre-released Oolite installer on Oolite\nGitHub.\n\n## Building from source\n\nYou can obtain the Oolite source from GitHub Source Code repo. Instructions on\nbuilding from source depend on your operating system and can be found on the\nwiki. You can also inspect the Github Workflow build-all.yml that\nautomatically builds Oolite for all supported platforms.\n\n## The beginning\n\nYou start the game with a Cobra III multi-role ship, and 100 credits in spare\ncash. The Cobra III is an excellent ship - or rather, it has the potential to\nbe an excellent ship. The one you own is very under-equipped, lacking basic\nupgrades for both combat and peaceful activities.\n\nNevertheless, even right now, it still has some advantages over the average\nship you'll meet:\n\n  1. It has decent shields and a substantial energy reserve.\n  2. It can carry four missiles, each of which - if used carefully - might save your life.\n  3. It's fast. You might not be able to outrun all attackers outright, but the longer you can run for, the more chance you have of finding help.\n\nThere are a lot of controls - most of the keys on a standard keyboard are used\nfor something - but many of these won't be necessary at first. Read the readme\nthat comes with the game, or use the 'Keyboard settings' option to get the\nbasic controls, and play the Tutorial option when starting a new game to get\nsome practice at basic flight, combat and navigation. as well as introductions\nto key ship systems.\n\nIf you are using a joystick, you can configure this by pressing 'F2' and\nselecting 'Game Options' while docked or in-flight while paused.\n\nWhatever career you want to pursue, though, you'll need to get some money to\nupgrade your ship a bit.\n\n## Lave Station\n\nYou're currently docked at Lave Station. Similar stations orbit the primary\ninhabited world of all Cooperative systems, and have facilities for trading,\nupgrading your ship, and communicating with people who may wish to offer you a\ndeal.\n\nLave is a 'Rich Agricultural' system, selling foodstuffs and other organic\nproducts relatively cheaply, and importing mechanical and electronic goods at\na good price. The easiest way to make money, though not the most profitable in\nthe long run, is to trade cargo containers between systems, on the principle\nof \"buy low, sell high\". For most trade goods, this means buying at an\nAgricultural world to sell at an Industrial one, or vice versa. Keep a record\nof the prices you see and you'll soon work out which the most profitable\ncargoes are.\n\nGo to the F8 screen (Market) and load some appropriate goods into your ship\n(up and down arrows to select goods, left and right arrows to move them\nbetween your ship and the market)\n\nNow go to the F6 screen (short range chart). This shows you all the nearby\nsystems, with a green circle the limit of your fuel range. Pressing 'i' will\nreplace the names with symbols showing the government type, economic type, and\ntechnological level of the systems. If you are unsure what a symbol means,\nthen move the cursor with the arrow keys until it is over a system, then press\nF7 to go to the system data screen to get a full description.\n\nYour ship is not yet well-equipped for combat, so you should if possible stick\nto the systems with safer governments - Corporate States, Democracies and\nConfederacies - until you have some better equipment. Anarchy and Feudal\nsystems are especially dangerous and should be avoided until you have a well-\nequipped ship and combat experience. Even Lave - a Dictatorship - may not be\nparticularly safe to return to.\n\nBased on the government and economy data, you should be able to see some\nsystems where the trade goods you have bought will make a profit in relative\nsafety. Move the cursor to one to select it as your destination, then launch\nfrom the station with F1.\n\n## Orbital space\n\nYou will now be launched from Lave station. Ahead of you will be the planet\nLave itself, and closer than that will be the navigation buoy for the station.\nYour first flight task is to pull up so that you don't run into the buoy.\n\nFly around the area of the station for a bit to get used to the controls.\nYou'll notice that the station is rotating to generate artificial gravity,\nwhich means that docking can be a challenge. Your Cobra III is a wide but\nshort ship - use 'v' to look at some external views, and then 'F1' to return\nto the forward view. To dock safely with a station, you need to be coming in\nfrom directly in front of the docking port, and with the port horizontal in\nfront of you.\n\nNow is a very good time to practice this. Fly out to near the buoy, then turn\nto face the station. Centre the docking port in your view, then fly in slowly,\nadjusting your course so that you can see all four inner walls of the docking\nport. Once you're close enough that the station is mostly filling your screen,\nstart rolling your ship to align the port horizontally, then keep rolling\nslowly to match the rotation. Make sure you're still coming in on course, and\nyou should get in safely. Your shields will protect you if you're a little off\ncourse, provided you're not going too fast.\n\nPractice launching and docking a few more times, until you're confident that\nyou know how to do it.\n\n## Going to a new system\n\nThe system you targeted earlier on the F6 screen should still be selected, so\nfly a little way from the station - its mass will interfere with the jump if\nit is too close - then press 'h' to activate the witchspace drive. This will\ncount down for 15 seconds, during which you are recommended to fly as level as\npossible, and then if nothing goes wrong you will arrive in your destination\nsystem.\n\nAhead of you will be the planet, and somewhere around that will be an orbital\nstation similar to the one you just left. On your HUD is a blue dial - the\ncompass. The green dot nearly centred in it is the planet - practice turning,\nwatching how the green dot moves, and then using the compass to find the\nplanet again.\n\nWhen you get close to the planet, the compass will change to point towards the\nstation. The first step, however, is to get towards the planet. Turn to face\nthe planet, accelerate to top speed, and get closer. If there are no other\nships about, your status light will be green, and you can use the torus drive\nto move considerably faster - press 'j' to activate it, and 'j' again to turn\nit off.\n\nYou are unlikely to reach the planet without meeting someone - if you're\nlucky, and if you followed the advice about safe systems, this will be a\ntrader, perhaps with some escort fighters, or a flight of police ships or\nbounty hunters, all of whom will ignore you for now if you don't cause\ntrouble.\n\nIf you are unlucky, it will be a pirate or several, and you will need to run,\nsurrender or fight. Pirates are after your cargo, so dumping a few cargo pods\n- press 'shift-D' - may get them to go after the cargo rather than you. Drop\ntoo much, of course, and you won't be making much of a profit.\n\nRunning is also a possibility - try to run towards the planet, if possible, as\nthis increases your chance of reaching safety or meeting some police ships\n(purple dots on the scanner) who will attack the pirates.\n\nFighting, with your ship as weak as it is, should be a last resort at this\nstage, but if the group is small you may stand a chance. Take on the smallest\nships first - they die more easily but can do just as much damage. Don't\nforget you can dump cargo to surrender if it goes badly.\n\nIf you fight, save your missiles if possible - the bigger pirate ships are\nlikely to have counter-measure systems which will destroy them almost as soon\nas you launch them. However, these systems are indiscriminate, and will\ndestroy pirate missiles too. Therefore, if a pirate launches a missile at you,\nlaunch one back! With any luck, both missiles will be destroyed, and you can\nkeep fighting. If that doesn't work, well, your missile will probably get\nthem. You now need to dodge and weave to avoid the enemy missile - you'll\nprobably survive if it hits a full shield, but only just.\n\n## The second station\n\nEventually you will reach the planet, hopefully with most of your cargo still\non board. Use the compass to locate the station, fly up to it, and dock like\nyou practiced. Sell the cargo - for a profit, if you chose well! - and go to\nthe F3 screen (equipment) to buy fuel, and perhaps replace missiles.\n\nCongratulations - you've survived your first trip. Save the game, then start\nplanning a second trading run! Trading is the easiest way to make a reasonable\namount of money with your starting ship, but you'll soon have enough spare to\nbuy equipment and take on other sorts of work.\n\n## Career options\n\nVery few pilots stick entirely to one of these careers throughout their time\nin space - or even in just one trip, and other careers are also open to\nqualified pilots.\n\n### Trading\n\nTraders make their money by buying goods from export systems and selling them\nat import systems, as you did above. The main requirement is a cargo hold -\nthe bigger the better. Many of the best profits can be found in dangerous\nsystems, so a ship which can defend itself or run away from trouble is also\nuseful.\n\nCertain illegal cargoes can fetch the highest profits, but will also attract\nsignificant attention from the police.\n\n### Mining\n\nWith a Mining Laser and Fuel Scoop fitted, it is possible to break asteroids\ndown into manageable chunks, and then collect those chunks to sell as\nminerals. It's a slow way to make money, but it's usually fairly safe.\n\n### Piracy\n\nThe practice of attacking trade ships to intimidate them into dumping cargo -\nor worse, destroying the ship in the hope that its wreckage will contain\nsomething salvageable - is illegal throughout Cooperative space, but the\nprofits which can be achieved cause many pilots to engage in it regardless of\nthe law.\n\n### Bounty hunting\n\nSmugglers, pirates and other criminals will have a bounty placed on their\ncraft by the Cooperative. Destruction of their ship will pay this bounty to\ntheir attacker, and many pilots use this as their main source of income.\n\n### Courier work\n\nPeople often need to be in a different system, or have small parcels to be\ntransported elsewhere, and are willing to pay a significant amount for this\nservice. A passenger service requires passenger cabins to be fitted, but\nparcels can be kept in your safe. Remember that some people wishing to travel\nmay have enemies - couriers tend to favour fast well-armed ships for their\nwork.\n\n### Salvage / rescue\n\nThe aftermath of a battle often leaves cargo containers and escape capsules\nfloating in space. Recovering these with a fuel scoop can give a significant\nprofit - escape capsules can have rewards of up to 500 credits for their safe\nreturn.\n\n## Other advice for new players from the Oolite Wiki\n\n  * Oolite Instruction Manual\n  * Pilot's Reference Manual\n  * Mr Gimlet's advice for new Commanders\n\nBasic Game Expansion Packs\n\nOolite's start screen includes an expansion pack manager and quick reference\nguides.\n\nLeaving Coriolis...again!\n\n\u2757 Expansions are created by community members and are provided \"as-is\", with\nno warranty or guarantee whatsoever, and are not endorsed or vetted by the\nOolite development team. Please take the time to read the information about an\nexpansion before installing it.\n\nThere are well over a thousand expansion packs released for Oolite. There are\ntwo expansion pack formats in use since Oolite 1.80, usually referred to as\nOXZ and OXP. The OXZ format is more modern and can be downloaded and installed\nautomatically by the game by selecting the \"Manage Expansion Packs\" option on\nthe start screen. The OXP format is older, easier to tweak and must be\ninstalled manually.\n\n  * Almost all released expansion packs, regardless of format, are also listed on the Wiki's various OXP List.\n  * The Wiki is also home to the developer documentation.\n  * If you have difficulty with an expansion pack, it is usually best to report this in its thread in the Expansion Pack forum.\n\nThe table below lists the OXZ expansion packs which can be automatically\ndownloaded by Oolite 1.80 (or higher), as well as links for manual downloads\nif you prefer to do that. If you are still using Oolite 1.77.1 or an earlier\nversion, these OXZ format expansion packs will not be usable.\n\nClick column header to sort table.

The Navy is there if you go looking. If you do your\nnormal trading, mining and bounty hunting you will never see them. They do\nnot, under any circumstances, meddle in internal system politics. So, you will\nnot be attacked by the Navy if you are an offender or even a fugitive for that\nmatter. That is a police matter.  \nShips| SuperSidewinder| 1.55| UK_Eliter| 2021-12-30  \nAdds an uber-version of the sidewinder.

They are not \u00fcber ships - far\nfrom it - but with the advent of heavy pirates and heavy assassins into the\ncore game, some toughening of GalCop Vipers seemed appropriate.  \nShips| Gecko 'Dragon Class'| 0.52| Montana05| 2021-12-03  \nA Gecko heavy fighter based on the technology of a wrecked Green Gecko from\nthe Green Knights of Lago.

A Warrant Scanner can be used by the player or NPC's to\nuncover bounties registered in other systems.  \nEquipment| Remove Individual Pylon| 1.0| phkb| 2021-07-23  \nAllows an individual pylon-mounted weapon to be removed.  \nMissions| Tionisla Reporter| 1.3.9| Eric Walsh, phkb| 2021-07-22  \nHave you always wanted to explore the universe beyond its boundaries?

And\nyou are the author of it.  \nDockables| Free Trade Zones| 0.31| Disembodied, Griff, phkb| 2021-07-22  \nAdds Free Trade Zones to Multi-Government systems (TL7+).  \nActivities| Interstellar Help| 2.3| Commander McLane| 2021-07-22  \nIntroduces some interaction with fellow commanders in interstellar space, who\nmight come to the player's rescue if they're stranded, or the player could be\nasked for help from other stranded ships.  \nEquipment| Deep Horizon Emergency Witchspace Initiator| 1.0.1| Cmd.

Just don't linger in the\nstation approach lane after you leave and get in the way, or else they won't\nbe best pleased... Recommended for new players learning how to dock manually,\nand for experienced players who want a bit of extra ambiance around main\nstations. Most messages from this OXP appear only if your ship does not have\nfunctional docking computers, but a few appear regardless, for example: Clear\nthe lane, Commander! If you see a message that starts with 'Traffic Control:'\nthen it is probably from this OXP. This OXP is neutral for beginners and\nslightly biased against the experienced player, because it enforces (with\nfines and small but escalating bounties) a sensible rule against the use of\ncloaking devices in proximity to main stations... however, to be fair, it will\nnot impose penalties if you pass undetected (or at least unidentified). Of\ncourse, requesting docking clearance or activating docking computers will\ntransmit your identity to the station... This OXP is compatible with all other\nOXPs, and includes considerations for Buoy Repair, ILS and AutoDock if those\nOXPs are also installed.  \nAmbience| Planetary Systems| 1.8.0| stranger| 2021-07-15  \nThis OXP simulates (pseudo)dynamic solar systems with terrestrial planets and\ngas giants.  \nShips| Dark Rainbow| 1.3| sdrubble| 2021-07-06  \nUber-Caduceus ship firing colorful plasma balls from 10 turrets.  \nWeapons| Missiles and Bombs| 2.8| Ramirez| 2021-07-01  \nAdds a wide variety of missiles & bombs that are are available to player &\nNPCs alike.  \nAmbience| Xenon Redux UI| 3.5| phkb| 2021-06-29  \nAdds backgrounds to all screens, allowing for a narrower screen ratio (eg\n4:3). Also includes new title screen music. Also requires the\nXenonReduxUIResources.oxz. For 16:9 screens, see Xenon UI. This OXP will\noverride any backgrounds currently applied by other OXP's. This is by design,\nin order to maintain the illusion of looking at a computer display. If\nconflicts arise, where important information needs to be given to the player\nvia a background screen, code can be applied to allow exceptions to take\nplace. See the Wiki page for more information.  \nMiscellaneous| Compressed F7 Layout| 1.3| phkb| 2021-06-15  \nMoves all standard F7 data to the top of the screen, leaving no blank lines\nbetween data elements, including details from 'Distant Suns' and 'Explorers\nClub', if installed.  \nShips| Fer-de-Pai| 0.50| Montana05| 2021-06-09  \nA remake of the Ferdepai, presenting a combination of a Fer-de-Lance and a Asp\nMark II, abandoning the luxurious trimmings in exchange for military\nequipment.  \nMissions| Long Way Round| 2.1| aegidian| 2021-06-08  \nLong Way Round mission in Galaxy 1  \nShips| Firefly Class Transport| 0.52.3| Staer9, Montana05| 2021-05-30  \nThis multi-purpose, medium-sized transport ship is a homage to the Firefly\nClass ship 'Serenity' from the firefly TV series.

Little is known about it, other than it's an organic\nlifeform living on asteroids. Once it gets a hold, it's very difficult to\neradicate, hence its other name \u2013 Hermit's Bane.  \nDockables| S.I.R.F.

Press\n\\\"i\\\" for more information. - - - - - - - - - - By granting the player a free\nescape pod they can escape at the cost of their cargo. It's the one piece of\nequipment in the core (non-ironman) game that typically leaves you\ndisadvantaged when you use it. Starting again (or at least reloading a save)\nwould actually be a less costly action in a great many cases, so as freebies\ngo this is of questionable monetary value. It is however a way to keep a game\nand the 'player story' going that might otherwise need to be restarted. The\nplayer pays for a bad encounter rather than being destroyed by it. The penalty\nis losing your cargo, and some (often extensive) damage to your equipment,\nwithout also paying a 1,000 credits for the privilege (which is not even\naffordable from the standard game start).  \nMechanics| Paddling Pool| 1.2| Redspear| 2021-01-27  \nTurns the Leesti - Diso milk run into a much safer route for the beginning\nplayer. Press 'i' for more information. - - - - - - - - - - Neuters the piracy\ninfluence of many neighboring systems by altering their governmnet types and\noccasionally their economies to prevent further lucrative safe routes\nemerging. It's not uncommon for the player to be attacked by large groups of\npirates even in the early game (when the player ship is especially\nvulnerable). Having a safe space to learn the ropes, within a single jump of\nLave, is what this oxp attempts to provide. The similarly nearby but\npotentially more lucrative routes of Zaonce/Tionisle - Isinor and Isinor -\nEnsoreous should be largely unaffected.  \nEquipment| Cargo Scoop as Standard| 1.1| Redspear| 2021-01-26  \nAwards Cargo Scoop to the player ship. Press 'i' for more information. - - - -\n- - - - - - Free cargo scoops mean that the beginning player can scoop debris.\nHowever unlikely it may seem, they could now be a pirate or even a miner\n(pulse laser will rarely splinter asteroids but it can happen) from the start.\nYou can't scoop fuel with them but should you accidentally jettison some cargo\nor be lucky enough to stumble across some salvage then the goods are yours.\nAlso, when you buy your first new piece of equipment, there's a chance that\nsomething rather less important might get damaged instead.

Can be used under duress to do similar\nto ships. Exhibits a strange technology ahead of its years. Colour: azure (I'm\nstruggling here). Military Laser: introducing the RimmerAce Quadcooled\nImpasseResolver. Yes, it's four times 'cooler' than any other military laser\nand is also the four times winner of the 'shiniest barrel' award.
