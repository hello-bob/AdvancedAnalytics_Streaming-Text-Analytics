It even managed to become\nthe #1 post on Hacker News for almost a day with more than 1,200 upvotes! I\nwas truly blown away by the response and caught off guard by the amount of\ninterest and support we received but thinking back, I think there were a few\nthings that we may have done right that helped us get there.\n\nOver the past few weeks, a lot of people have asked me for tips on how to\nlaunch an open-source project, so I decided to write this article to share my\nexperience with an actionable list of tips that might help you launch your\nproject successfully.\n\n## Have a well-written README.md\n\nThis is your \"landing page\" and the first thing people see when they visit\nyour project. Make sure it's well-written, concise, and informative. Avoid\nfluff and buzzwords. Include a clear link to the demo, a brief description of\nthe project, installation instructions, usage examples, and a list of\nfeatures. Make sure to include screenshots and gifs to make it more visually\nappealing. It's also important to include links to social media,\ndocumentation, and other resources. Feel free to use our README.md as a\ntemplate.\n\nPuter's README.md, the full extent of my design skills!\n\n## Have a demo that \"Just WorksTM\"\n\nCreate a working demo of your project that people can try out, preferably\nwithout having to install/sign up for anything. If your demo is a site,\nprovide a clear, prominent link in the README.\n\n## Add an FAQ section\n\nInclude a FAQ section in your README.md to answer common questions that people\nmight have about your project. This was particularly helpful for Puter because\nit's a new concept and historically I knew that a lot of people had questions\nabout its use cases and architecture (\"Why we used jQuery?\").\n\n## LICENSE\n\nMake sure to include a LICENSE file in your project. I strongly recommend\nusing a well-known open-source license like MIT, AGPL,... Using less-known\nlicenses can make it harder for people to contribute to your project mostly\nbecause there is typically an \"understanding tax\" (term coined by [Heather\nMeeker](https://www.techlawpartners.com/heather)) that comes with less-known\nlicenses where contributors need to read and understand the license before\nthey can contribute. This can be a huge barrier to entry for new contributors,\nwhereas individuals and companies are typically familiar with the implications\nof well-known licenses and can start contributing right away.\n\n## CONTRIBUTING.md\n\nThis will help guide contributors on how to contribute to your project.\nInclude information on how to create issues, and how to submit a PR, ... Make\nsure to be welcoming and encouraging to new contributors. We have a simple\nCONTRIBUTING.md that you could use as a template.\n\n## SECURITY.md\n\nif applicable, create a SECURITY.md file in your project. This will help guide\nusers on how to report security vulnerabilities in your project. You may need\nto create a dedicated email address for security researchers to contact you.\nFeel free to use our SECURITY.md as a template.\n\n## SECURITY-ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md\n\nif applicable, create a SECURITY-ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md file in your project.\nIt's essential to acknowledge responsible disclosure and thank security\nresearchers who report vulnerabilities in your project. This will help build\ntrust with the security community and encourage more people to report\nvulnerabilities. It also signals to the community that you are a professional\nmaintainer and take security seriously.\n\n## Make installation/usage easy\n\nMake sure to include clear and concise installation instructions in your\nREADME.md. Ideally, you should have a one-liner that users can copy and paste\nto install your project. If your project has dependencies, make sure to\ninclude instructions on how to install them. You want developers to\nimmediately see the value of your project and start using it. For Puter, I\nwent to great lengths to make sure that you can get started with just a simple\n`npm install`.\n\n## Implement CI/CD\n\nImplement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for your\nproject. This will help automate the testing and deployment process and make\nit easier for contributors to submit PRs. We use Github Actions for Puter and\nit has been a game-changer. Even though we did not have this in place when we\nlaunched, it was one of the first things the community contributed and it has\nbeen a huge help.\n\n## Take the Github sidebar seriously\n\nMake sure to fill out the \"About\" section and use relevant tags for the\n\"Topics\" section. This will help people discover your project and increase its\nvisibility on GitHub. This really helps with discoverability. Do you have a\nwebsite? Make sure to add it to the \"Website\" section. This will help people\nfind more information about your project and stay up to date with the latest\nnews.\n\nThe sidebar provides a quick summary of the project.\n\n## Create \"First good issue\" issues\n\nYou want to make it super easy for people to get started contributing to your\nproject. Create a \"First good issue\" label and tag some easy issues with it.\nThese issues should ideally take only a few minutes to fix and require minimal\nknowledge of the codebase. This will help attract new contributors and make\nthem feel welcome. Making sense of somebody else's codebase is hard, make it\neasy for them.\n\n## Discord/Slack community\n\nCreate a Discord or Slack community for your project and make sure to link it\nin your README.md. This will help foster a sense of community and make it\neasier for contributors to communicate with each other. It's also a great way\nto get feedback and suggestions from users.\n\n## Do a soft launch first\n\nBefore you officially open-source your project, do a soft launch with a small\ngroup of people. I did this mostly for 2 reasons: 1) to make sure the\nREADME.md is clear enough and 2) to make sure that Puter is easy enough to get\nstarted with within seconds. Sometimes your description of the project might\nbe too long or not be clear enough, the screenshot may be too small and you\nhaven't noticed because you didn't test on mobile, the installation process\nmight break on windows because you only tested on Mac,... Doing a soft launch\nwill help you identify a lot of these issues and iron out the kinks before the\nofficial launch.\n\n## Promote your project but don't spam (duh)\n\nOnce you've open-sourced your project, make sure to post it on social media,\nReddit, Hacker News, and other platforms. DO NOT spam or be annoying,\ndevelopers and the OSS community are super smart and can smell BS from a mile\naway. Be genuine and share your project with the world. If your project\nresonates with people, they will share it with others and help spread the\nword. I think you should avoid buzzwords like the plague, they suck in general\nbut they are particularly bad in the OSS community.\n\n## Let your users know you're open-source\n\nIf you have an existing user base, make sure to let them know that you've\nopen-sourced your project. An open-source announcement is typically going to\nhave a much better open rate than a regular \"marketing\" email and it's a great\nway to get your users excited about the project.\n\n## Be responsive\n\nMake sure to respond to chats, issues and PRs in a timely manner. This will\nshow that you care about your project and are actively maintaining it. It's\nalso a great way to build trust with your contributors and users. When we\nopen-sourced Puter, we barely got any sleep for the first two weeks because we\nwere responding to emails, chats, issues, and PRs almost 24/7. It was\nexhausting but 100% made a difference.\n\n## Good luck!\n\nI hope these tips help you launch your project successfully.
