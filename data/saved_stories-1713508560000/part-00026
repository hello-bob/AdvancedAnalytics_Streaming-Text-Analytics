We want this conference to be unique and\ndedicated not only to the future of the project, but also celebrate its\nhistory.\n\nWe especially invite proposals, not only directly related to the project, the\ncommunity around it, but also to the use of data.\n\nWe would love to see your submission for one or more of these topics:\n\n  * OpenStreetMap,\n  * community and OSM Foundation,\n  * mapping,\n  * cartography,\n  * software development,\n  * data analysis & data model,\n  * use of OSM data,\n  * OSM user experiences,\n  * anything else OSM related.\n\n### Submission Types\n\nThe table below lists the available submission types.\n\n#### Submission type\n\n#### Estimated time\n\n#### Description\n\nLightning Talk\n\n10 minutes\n\nLightning talks will be short 10 minute talks. There will be some spaces for\nlast-minute in-person talks.\n\nOral Presentation\n\n20 minute talk + 10 minute discussion\n\nClassic oral presentation of about 20 minutes for the talk itself followed by\na discussion session. This is the preferred submission type.\n\nExtended Oral Presentation\n\n40 minute talk + 15 minute discussion\n\n40 minutes for the presentation and 15 minutes for Q&A. These are for topics\nyou want to explore in more depth. You should outline why your presentation\ndeserves more time.\n\nPanel Discussion\n\n1 hour\n\nPanels are for hot or controversial topics around OSM community, mapping and\ndata. For example gender diversity, legal questions or the future of the OSM\ndatabase. You should outline the format on how you intend to organise the\ndiscussion and make sure to invite the key players for the discussion. We\nwelcome panels that include the audience. A designated moderator is therefore\nstrongly recommended.\n\nWorkshop\n\nhour and a half\n\nWorkshops are sessions in which the participants are actively involved, for\nexample by following some steps on their own devices. We welcome workshops\nthat cover basic beginners\u2019s topics as well as innovative technologies. Please\ncommunicate any requirements for participants in order to attend your proposed\nworkshop regarding technical equipment. Please ensure that your participants\nshouldn\u2019t be told to create an account at a business platform or a platform\nwith user tracking. Or, if so, communicate that clearly in your submission and\nprovide guest accounts for your participants.\n\nOther\n\n?\n\nYour submission does not fit into any of these submission types? Please get in\ntouch with the programme committee via email (cfp@openstreetmap.pl) before the\nend of the call for participation.\n\n### Other session types\n\nWe plan to provide space for other session types which cannot be submitted in\nadvance. Details will be announced before the conference.\n\n#### Birds of a Feather\n\nBirds of a Feather (BoF) sessions are informal, spontaneous discussion rounds\ncentered around a specific topic. It is not possible to submit a BoF session\nin advance. BoFs are about to be organized during the conference according to\nthe needs of participants.\n\n#### Free Space for discussion\n\nThe organizer in certain cases may provide free discussion space for working\ngroups, OSM local branches and local communities\n\n### Rating Criteria\n\nIn rating submissions, we are going to apply the following criteria:\n\n  * OSM as the subject: A submission where OSM is the main subject or an important ingredient is rated higher than one that is more generic (e.g. a general talk about GIS software).\n  * Preference of \u201copen\u201d: A submission about open data and open source software is preferred over the one that deals with proprietary data or proprietary software and closed platforms.\n  * Preference of innovation: A submission about something new, or something not discussed at previous conferences, is preferred over one that discusses more widely known issues (exception: OSM Basics).\n  * We are hoping for talks from a multitude of speakers and hence we would prefer accepting a talk from a \u201cnew\u201d speaker over accepting a second talk from someone who has already an accepted talk.\n  * We may also try to avoid accepting too many talks from members of the same organisation.\n  * We prefer talks from members of underrepresented groups.\n  * We value transparency. We prefer submissions that disclose affiliations and sponsors of their work.\n\nIn rating submissions, we are going to apply the following criteria:\n\n  * We might ask if several speakers can merge their talks.\n  * We might also ask if a change of format would be possible (for example we might suggest the lightning talk format instead of a regular oral presentation when we find there is not enough content for a complete talk, but an interesting subject).\n\n### Language\n\nThe conference language of State of the Map Europe is English. All\npresentations shall be held in English. It is an important aspect of the\nconference that participants can interact with the speakers for questions and\ndiscussions. Non-English speaking participants are welcome to meet in the\nBirds of a Feather sessions.\n\n### Publication\n\nBy default, video recordings and slides of the lectures are to be published\nunder the Creative Commons Attribution International 4.0 (CC BY 4.0) license.\nIf, for some reasons, you cannot issue your content under the CC BY 4.0\nlicense indicate why and which other free licenses are you willing to accept.\n\n### Fees\n\nState of the Map Europe is a non-commercial event where neither organizers nor\nspeakers are paid. Contributors do not have any special privileges when it\ncomes to conference fees, however the organizing committee reserves the right\nto waive this requirement for key speakers.\n\n### Programme Committee\n\nYour submissions will be reviewed by the Programme Committee consisting of\nOpenStreetMap community members from various parts of the world. The Programme\nCommittee is aware of possible conflict of interest situations. We try to\nbalance that in the composition of the committee. Nevertheless, we have\nimposed some rules upon ourselves to handle conflict of interest situations:\n\n  * We do not rate submissions from our workmates, clients or relatives.\n  * We act carefully and are aware about possible conflicts (especially the situation of horse trading). We act particularly carefully in cases associated to a sponsor.\n  * We communicate to other Programme Committee members when we are in a conflict of interest situation.\n  * We report any outside attempt of influencing their decisions.\n\nWe hope this detailed \u201cCall for participation\u201d helps to increase the\ntransparency of our programme selection process. Questions are welcome. You\ncan reach us at the following email address: cfp@openstreetmap.pl.\n\n### Registration\n\nApplications can be submitted until April 30, 2024 at 7:48 p.m. (GMT+1). The\nsubmitted application can be edited.\n\nSubmit a proposal\n\n\u00a9 State of the Map Europe 2024 OpenStreetMap Poland\n\nDesigner Arsen Mosiichuk Repository Github\n\n", "frontpage": false}
