Now, it\u2019s the standard kart from Jakks Pacific.\n\nbyNico DeMattia| PUBLISHED Apr 25, 2024 5:13 PM EDT\n\nNews\n\nShare\n\n0\n\nNico DeMattiaView nico demattia's Articles\n\nNicoDeMattia\n\nThe next race at Dry Dry Ruins is postponed because Mario has been ordered to\npark his kart. Just like the Tesla Cybertruck last week, the Jakks Pacific\nMario Kart ride-on toy for kids is being recalled for unintended acceleration.\n\nAccording to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, certain 24-volt Mario\nKart ride-on cars may be a crash hazard to children. Debris can get clogged in\nthe accelerator pedal mechanism, holding it to the floor even when the user's\nfoot is lifted, causing unintended acceleration. Around 17,500 of these Mario\nKarts are affected by this problem.\n\nJakk's must have remedied the problem, as the CPSC states that none of the\nmodels currently on sale are affected. However, owners of affected Mario Karts\nwill get a free replacement pedal kit with instructions and are told to stop\nusing them until the pedal is fixed. There aren't any instances of serious\nchild injury, even after 65 reports of this issue and 15 reports of karts\ncrashing into permanent structures. Only one minor injury has been reported: a\nchafed hand. Thankfully, none of these Mario Karts accelerated unexpectedly\ntoward a street with oncoming cars.\n\nIf you have one of these Jakks Mario Karts and want to know if yours is part\nof the recall, there's an eight-digit alphanumeric date code on the bottom of\nthe kart. You can see which date codes are part of the recall here.\n\nJakks Pacific\n\nPart of me thinks a Mario Kart recall is very funny. However, the parent side\nof my brain realizes how scary that can be. If it unexpectedly accelerates\ninto a dangerous situation, kids usually aren't quick enough to think on their\nfeet and handle it safely. This could be way more dangerous than slipping on a\nbanana peel or being hit by a spinning turtle shell.\n\nGot tips?
