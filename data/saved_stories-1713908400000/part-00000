However, Vivo and Honor didn't see the biggest gains, with the\nlatter seeing a respectable 11.5 percent boost and Vivo mostly stagnating with\na loss of 0.4 percent. Huawei was by far the biggest winner thanks to 69.7\npercent higher sales than in Q1 of 2023, and its market share of 15.5 percent\nis just behind Apple's 15.7 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, Xiaomi clocked in an 8.6 percent increase in sales, and Oppo's\nsales declined by 15.5 percent, the second-worst behind Apple.\n\nMarket share between the six biggest brands in China are now much tighter than\nthey were in Q1 of 2023, which saw a 10 point gap between Apple and Huawei,\nrespectively the biggest and smallest brands at the time.\n\nOne of the primary reasons China's homegrown phone brands did so well was\nbecause they dominate the lower end of the market. \"Vivo gained the top spot\nthis quarter with 17.4 percent share driven by strong sales of the Y35 Plus\nand Y36 models in the low-end segment and the S18 in the mid-end segment,\"\nCounterpoint Research's Ivan Lam said.\n\nMeanwhile, Huawei's high-end smartphones like the Mate 60 are putting pressure\non Apple from the other side of the market. \"Apple's sales were subdued during\nthe quarter as Huawei's comeback has directly impacted Apple in the premium\nsegment,\" Lam said.\n\nHuawei's performance might call into question Commerce Secretary Gina\nRaimundo's assertion that Huawei can't produce its 7nm Kirin 9000S SoCs at\nscale. However, it's not clear how much of a profit Huawei is turning on these\n7nm chips, which are reportedly made using deep ultraviolet rather than\nextreme ultraviolet technology, something that could greatly impact yields and\nthus cost.\n\n### Chinese New Year boosted China brands, and Apple could bounce back\n\nThe report also identifies the Chinese New Year celebrations as a key reason\nwhy Apple lost so much ground, particularly in Q1. \"The sales promotions\nduring the Chinese New Year festivities were the biggest growth driver,\"\nassociate director Ethan Qi said. \"The average weekly sales during the four\nweeks leading up to the Chinese New Year saw a robust growth of 20 percent\nwhen compared to a normal week.\"\n\nObviously, Chinese New Year lasts for a very small part of the year, and may\nonly temporarily suppress iPhone sales in the country. Counterpoint Research\nalready sees evidence that iPhone sales are ticking back up, as Lam said: \"We\nare seeing slow but steady improvement from week to week, so momentum could be\nshifting.\"\n\n  * Huawei wants to take homegrown HarmonyOS phone platform worldwide\n  * Huawei's latest flagship smartphone contains no world-shaking silicon surprises\n  * Fraudsters abused Apple Stores' third-party pickup policy to phish for profits\n  * Official: EU users can swerve App Store and download iOS apps from the web\n\n\"For the second quarter, the possibility of new color options combined with\naggressive sales initiatives could bring the brand back into positive\nterritory; and of course, we are waiting to see what its AI features will\noffer come WWDC in June,\" Lam continued.\n\nThough, Reg readers shouldn't expect Apple or Tim Cook to predict they'll be\nback in the green in China any time soon; they only just settled a $490mn\nlawsuit over the last time they claimed iPhone sales were good in China when\nthey very much weren't. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Apple\n  * China\n  * Huawei\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Apple\n  * China\n  * Huawei\n  * Smartphone\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AirTag\n  * Apple M1\n  * App stores\n  * China Mobile\n  * China telecom\n  * China Unicom\n  * Cyberspace Administration of China\n  * Great Firewall\n  * Hong Kong\n  * HONOR\n  * iCloud\n  * iMac\n  * iOS\n  * iPad\n  * iPhone\n  * iPod\n  * iTunes\n  * JD.com\n  * Mac\n  * MacBook\n  * Safari\n  * Samsung Galaxy Ace\n  * Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation\n  * Shenzhen\n  * Siri\n  * Tim Cook\n  * Uyghur Muslims\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * APAC\n  * Steve Jobs\n  * Steve Wozniak\n\n#### More about\n\n4 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Apple\n  * China\n  * Huawei\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Apple\n  * China\n  * Huawei\n  * Smartphone\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AirTag\n  * Apple M1\n  * App stores\n  * China Mobile\n  * China telecom\n  * China Unicom\n  * Cyberspace Administration of China\n  * Great Firewall\n  * Hong Kong\n  * HONOR\n  * iCloud\n  * iMac\n  * iOS\n  * iPad\n  * iPhone\n  * iPod\n  * iTunes\n  * JD.com\n  * Mac\n  * MacBook\n  * Safari\n  * Samsung Galaxy Ace\n  * Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation\n  * Shenzhen\n  * Siri\n  * Tim Cook\n  * Uyghur Muslims\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * APAC\n  * Steve Jobs\n  * Steve Wozniak\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Huawei wants to take homegrown HarmonyOS phone platform worldwide\n\nChinese tech juggernaut eyes global expansion despite US tech restrictions\n\nOSes21 hrs | 16\n\n#### WhatsApp, Threads, more banished from Apple App Store in China\n\nStill available in Hong Kong and Macau, for now\n\nSecurity4 days | 8\n\n#### World is finally buying more phones and prices are rising\n\nSomeone forgot to tell Apple and Samsung as Chinese brands rebound\n\nPersonal Tech8 days | 14\n\n#### Industrial systems integrating digitalisation\n\nHuawei solutions designed to speed up digital and intelligent transformation\nacross key vertical industries\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Where there's a will, there's Huawei to develop one's own chipmaking kit\n\nExport restrictions and sanctions working well, we see\n\nSystems12 days | 26\n\n#### US lawmakers rage over Intel Meteor Lake-powered Huawei PC\n\nSpecial export license granted to Intel by President Trump unlikely to be\nrenewed\n\nSystems8 days | 8\n\n#### China orders its telcos to rip and replace US chips with homegrown\nsilicon by 2027\n\nThere's no Huawei we saw that coming\n\nNetworks10 days | 92\n\n#### Huawei's latest flagship smartphone contains no world-shaking silicon\nsurprises\n\nKirin 9010 SoC powering the Pura 70 is impressive, but doesn't indicate\nunforeseen prowess\n\nPersonal Tech4 days | 13\n\n#### Apple to allow some iPhones to be repaired with used parts\n\n'A strategy of half-promises and unnecessarily complicated hedges'\n\nPersonal Tech12 days | 15\n\n#### Apple's failure to duck UK antitrust probe could bring \u00a3785M windfall for\ndevs\n\nThat 30% app tax may turn out to be a hefty liability\n\nLegal11 days | 18\n\n#### Official: EU users can swerve App Store and download iOS apps from the\nweb\n\nAnticompetitive remedies?
