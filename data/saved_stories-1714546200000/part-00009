As per a 2023 Developer Skills Report by\nHackerRank, Python is one of the most in-demand programming language globally.\n\nThe programming language is used by data scientists to analyse large datasets\nand extract insights, web developers use it to build server-side web\napplications and automate web scrapping tasks. Python is also used by machine\nlearning engineers to design train and deploy machine learning models. The\nprogramming language can also help in automating repetitive tasks and\nimproving their efficiency.\n\nThis suggests a continuing need for Python developers across various\nindustries. According to a report by GitHub, Python remains the second most-\nused programming language on that platform. Developer adoption in general is\non the rise in Europe with year-on-year growth in the number of developers in\nSpain at 25 per cent, 22 per cent in Germany, Italy, and France and 24 per\ncent in Portugal using the language.\n\nPython developers in the era of AI\n\nSince we are at the cusp of an AI revolution, many do fear that AI might take\naway their jobs, however, that may not be the reality for all. Machine\nlearning, which is a core part of AI relies heavily on Python. The Python\nlibraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch provide pre-built functions for AI\ntasks. The programming language is a huge pillar in AI development cycle.\n\nWhile Python developers will see a shift in the type of work like focusing\nmore on making AI models or integrating AI into existing systems, their skills\nwill still remain relevant and crucial in the industry. According to The Next\nWeb, all the Big Tech companies along with others like Intel, IBM, Netflix,\nFacebook and Spotify use Python as their primary language. YouTube is also\nwritten in Python and is one of four main languages deployed at Google.\n\nAs for the Google layoffs, a report by Free Press Journal has revealed that\nthe Sundar Pichai-led company has fired its entire Python team for \u2018cheap\u2019\nlabour. As per the report, Google plans to hire cheaper labour outside the\nUnited States, maybe Munich, Germany, to reduce costs for the company.\n\nThe US Python team reportedly had less than 10 members who were responsible\nfor overseeing a large part of the Python ecosystem at Google. Their work\nincluded maintaining a stable version of Python at Google, updating thousands\nof third-party packages, and developing a typechecker.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nGoogle layoffs: Sundar Pichai-led company allegedly fires entire Python team\n\nIndian startup Healthify lays off 30% workforce amidst plans for global\nexpansion\n\n### SPOTLIGHT\n\n  * 'Narendra Modi waived off Rs 16 lakh crore loan of his billionaire friends': Rahul Gandhi\n\nMOST READ\n\n  * IRFC, RVNL, IRCON, RITES, RailTel: PL shares price targets for these railway stocks\n\nMOST READ\n\n  * Stock Market Holidays in May 2024: NSE, BSE to remain closed on these days\n\nTRENDING\n\n  * Trouble deepens for JDS: MLA demands Revanna and Prajwal's expulsion, says 19 MLAs are important or...\n\nTRENDING\n\n  * Modi winning will be very positive as he has clear vision for India, says Mark Mobius\n\nTRENDING\n\n  * 'Manmohan dismissed 11 state govts, Modi - zero': Ex-CEA K Subramanian to Raghuram Rajan on 'declining democracy' in India\n\nTRENDING\n\n  * Adani Energy Solutions, Adani Total Gas: 2 Adani firms to share Q4 results on Tuesday, April 30\n\nTRENDING\n\n  * Kejriwal can't defend unrecorded statement if not present at summon, says Supreme Court\n\nTRENDING\n\nPublished on: Apr 29, 2024, 4:40 PM IST\n\nIN THIS STORY\n\n  * #google\n  * #Google Layoffs\n\nFollow Us on Channel\n\n## TOP STORIES\n\n  * AstraZeneca's admission of Covishield risk may spark legal battles in India\n  * Kotak Mahindra Bank Joint MD KVS Manian steps down with immediate effect\n  * IndiGo CEO confident in bridging India's long-haul flight gap\n  * Adani Total Gas Q4 results: Net profit rises 71%, dividend announced\n  * Sebi board issues guidelines to check fraudulent trades in mutual funds\n\n## TOP VIDEOS\n\n  * 1:29 Piyush Goyal Discusses Mumbai Development, Inheritance Tax, Fake Videos, And More\n  * 4:56 Faith And Ballots: The Intersection Of Religion And Politics In Prayagraj\n  * 7:54 Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan Says India\u2019s Growth Rate Much Lower Than 8.5%\n  * 3:44 Unraveling The Amit Shah Fake Video Controversy\n  * 1:25 Dharmesh Kant Of Chola Securities Gives Reasons Why REC & PFC Are Ripe For Investment\n\n  * SEBI bars Safefbulls operators from trading, asks them to pay back profit made in 'manipulative' trading\n  * Up to 768% return in a year: Are these 10 stocks the biggest multibaggers in LIC's portfolio?\n  * TCS, INFY, Wipro: How major IT firms have performed in FY24.
