Here are my 7 thoughts on the suit:\n\n1)\n\nFacebook banned me without warning. After I made it clear in my very first\nreply to them that I gave out Unfollow Everything for free to help people,\nthey said a huge \u2018Oh jeeez\u2019 accompanied by a facepalm, apologised for their\nbullying letter, restored my accounts, and we parted ways amicably.\n\nJust kidding! They could not have cared less, and carried on pursuing me for\nnearly a year.\n\nIf they had treated me a little more fairly, I wouldn\u2019t have written about\ntheir ban in Slate, Zuckerman would never have heard of Unfollow Everything,\nand this suit wouldn\u2019t exist.\n\nNow, for once, they\u2019re facing consequences for using their trillion-dollar\nmight to bully a solo developer. And I\u2019m lucky enough to be the solo developer\nin question. Hence the GIF.\n\n2 things you should know about me: 1) I write about how much I love Big Tech.\n2) I\u2019m never sarcastic. Subscribe here:\n\n2) Most people aren\u2019t so lucky\n\nI\u2019m one of probably hundreds of people who have received cease-and-desists\nfrom Big Tech for building something in the public interest. But I\u2019m one of\nthe vanishingly rare cases where the substance of the cease-and-desist might\nend up being challenged in court.\n\nLook at the case of the NYU Ad Observatory, for instance. It was run by a\ngoddamn famous university! And yet the researchers behind it were banned from\nFacebook, and there\u2019s never been a day in court to decide whether that was\nlegal or not.\n\nThat\u2019s because going to court can be a disaster for myriad reasons, even if\nyou\u2019re completely in the right. Time, money, stress.\n\nFor me, personally, it\u2019s amazing that Unfollow Everything 2.0 is going to\ncourt. I\u2019m over the moon, not to mention insanely grateful to Zuckerman for\ntaking on this huge burden. But the exception proves the rule. Too many people\nbuilding great software to undermine Big Tech\u2019s power get bullied, and in\nbasically all cases, Big Tech gets away with it. Not to mention all the people\nwho don\u2019t build great software because they know where they\u2019ll end up.\n\nThe answer? Regulation. Please don\u2019t fall asleep, I promise I won\u2019t mention\nthe R-word again.\n\n3) Meta\u2019s cease-and-desist calculus will change\n\nBut back to the good news: this suit is a giant exercise in calling Meta\u2019s\nbluff. Even if it never gets to court, the fact that it\u2019s been launched will\ngive Meta (and others) pause for thought every time they send out a spurious\ncease-and-desist, especially against developers building in the public\ninterest.\n\nThey\u2019ll know their bluff might be called, and adjust accordingly.\n\n(Or maybe they won\u2019t. But it makes me feel good to say that they will, and\nwe\u2019ll probably never know either way.)\n\n4) And users may gain more control over Big Tech\n\nAs Cory Doctorow has noted, this case could help disenshittify the internet,\nby allowing more adversarial interoperability:\n\n\u201cIf Zuckerman is successful, he will set a precedent that allows toolsmiths to\nprovide internet users with a wide variety of automation tools that customize\nthe information they see online.\u201d\n\nMike Masnick describes these as middlewares, and they\u2019re my seriously unsexy\ndream. It\u2019s what Unfollow Everything was all about \u2014 giving users a way to\nmanage their Facebook usage that doesn\u2019t rely on Facebook\u2019s own software.\n\nCrucial, because Facebook would never have built the Unfollow Everything\nfeature themselves, depriving users of choice over how to use their product.\n\nYou might not think this is a big deal. For me, it\u2019s huge. The waking hours we\nspend on digital devices will likely only keep increasing. The existence of\nthis kind of middleware (or nudgeware, as I like to call it) could mean the\ndifference between us deciding how we spend our time vs. Big Tech deciding for\nus.\n\n5) But Meta\u2019s a company that doesn\u2019t feel things\n\nMeta\u2019s legal bullying caused me many sleepless nights, and made me retreat\ninto my shell like a tortoise for a number of years.\n\nNow they will face the misery they deserve, for everything they have done to\nme!\n\nNope. This suit might cause a mild frown from Nick Clegg for approximately 1.3\nseconds. There\u2019ll be no human moment of someone admitting guilt, feeling bad,\nhaving regrets.\n\nIn fact, the likeliest human impact on the Meta side is that some of their\nlawyers celebrate being able to charge more hours at an extortionate rate.\nThey might even want to use the same GIF that I did.\n\nThat\u2019s the injustice of a trillion dollar company going after an individual.\nThe individual has a properly shit time, the trillion dollar company barely\nbats an eyelid.\n\n6) Jurisdiction affects justice\n\nDo I regret not suing Meta myself? No. As a UK resident, I signed up to\nFacebook terms that meant I\u2019d have to sue in Ireland \u2014 or possibly in the UK\nusing some of our Great British Consumer Laws.\n\nBut, as I found when talking to UK and Ireland lawyers after it happened, both\nthose jurisdictions have legal systems where I\u2019d have to pay (probably huge)\ncosts of Facebook\u2019s lawyers if I lost.\n\nSo I\u2019d have to first find a billionaire to foot the bill, and convince them to\nput aside essentially unlimited funds, because I wouldn\u2019t even know how much\nFacebook\u2019s lawyers would cost until later in the proceedings (which is why\ncrowdfunding wouldn\u2019t work \u2014 once you know how much you have to raise, your\nrisk is too high if you fail).\n\nEven then, without an organization backing me \u2014 think PR team, in-house legal\nadvice \u2014 I would have been overwhelmed. And as someone who\u2019s self-employed, I\nwouldn\u2019t have had a stable, benevolent employer to ask for time off to go to\ncourt. My employer is me, and he\u2019s a proper asshole.\n\n7) It\u2019s ZOOK, not Zuck\n\nFinally, to show my infinite gratitude to Zuckerman, I\u2019m hereby boosting\nawareness of the fact that his name is pronounced \u2018ZOOK er man\u2019, making the\nheadline of this article \u2018ZOOK vs. Zuck\u2019.\n\nAs someone who frequently gets called \u2018LouiS\u2019 with a hard \u2018s\u2019 at the end,\ninstead of the correct pronunciation \u2018LouiE\u2019, I feel his pain. OK, it\u2019s\nextremely mild \u2014 but I think still technically qualifies as a pain.\n\nThanks, Zook.\n\nI\u2019m working on 12 Challenges to make the internet a bit better.
