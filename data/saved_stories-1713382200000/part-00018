See Wikipedia's guide to writing better articles for suggestions.\n(November 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)  \n---  \n  \nGal\u00e1pagos syndrome (\u30ac\u30e9\u30d1\u30b4\u30b9\u5316, Garapagosu-ka, / Gal\u00e1pagos effect) is a term of\nJapanese origin used in business studies to refer to an isolated development\nbranch of a globally available product. The term is used as an analogy to a\npart of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species. Darwin encountered in the\nGal\u00e1pagos Islands isolated flora and fauna, which had undergone evolutionary\nchanges independently from the mainland. This phenomenon was a key to the\ndevelopment of evolutionary theory.^[1] Darwin stated that due to the\ndifferences in environment from one island to another, species adapted to make\nsurvival more viable in the local environment of each island. Similarly, a\ndevelopment of goods \"in relative isolation from the rest of the world because\nof a focus on the local market\"^[2] can lead to similarly differing products.\n\nThe term \"Gal\u00e1pagos syndrome\" has been used as a metaphor outside the field of\nbusiness jargon. The term \"Gal\u00e1pagosization\", referring to the process of the\nisolation of Japanese \"Gal\u00e1pagos-thinking\", links this process to the Japanese\nisland mentality.^[3]^[4]^[5]\n\n## Examples in Japan[edit]\n\n### Technology[edit]\n\n#### Mobile phones[edit]\n\nThe term \"Gal\u00e1pagos syndrome\" was originally coined to refer to Japanese 3G\nmobile phones, which had developed a large number of specialized features that\nwere widely adopted in the Japanese market, but were unsuccessful\nabroad.^[6]^[7] While the original usage of the term was to describe highly\nadvanced phones that were incompatible outside of Japanese networks, as the\nmobile phone industry underwent drastic changes globally, the term was used to\nemphasize the associated anxiety about how the development of Japanese mobile\nphones and those in the worldwide economy went along different paths. A\nderived term is Gara-phone (\u30ac\u30e9\u30b1\u30fc, gara-kei), blending with \"mobile phone\" (\u643a\u5e2f,\nkeitai), used to refer to Japanese feature phones, by contrast with newer\nsmart phones. Takeshi Natsuno, professor at Tokyo's Keio University,\nexplained, \"Japan's cellphones are like the endemic species that Darwin\nencountered on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands\u2014fantastically evolved and divergent from\ntheir mainland cousins.\"^[1] \"Japanese phones suffer from 'Galapagos\nSyndrome'\u2014are too complex to survive abroad.\"^[8]\n\n#### Cash machines[edit]\n\nAcross Japan, the majority of the 190,000 ATMs do not accept bank and credit\ncards that have been issued outside of the country. According to an April 2022\narticle^[citation needed], only about 20,000 post offices and convenience\nstores allow retrieving cash using non-Japanese bank cards. The Japanese\ngovernment has expressed concern about this issue, and as a result the number\nof ATMs that accept foreign cards is^[when?] slowly increasing.^[9]\n\n#### Wallet phone[edit]\n\nIn 2004, the wallet phone was introduced in Japan as a means to allow mobile\npayment alongside numerous other applications. In some ways the wallet phone\ncan be seen as a predecessor of mobile payment tools that were later released\non the global market such as Apple Pay or Google Wallet.^[10]\n\n### Kei cars (\u8efd\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca)[edit]\n\nKei cars (\"light cars\") are small four-wheeled vehicles/cars that have an\nengine of less than 660cc and enjoy preferential treatment in the form of tax\nadvantages and lower insurance costs. Originally the Japanese government\nencouraged the use of those \"light cars\". This category of cars features a\nnumber of different car types including sport cars, minivans and commercial\nvehicles. However, Kei cars are not seen as profitable in export markets and\ntherefore are only part of the Japanese automobile market.^[11] Despite no\nsignificant global success, major Japanese car manufacturers such as Suzuki,\nMitsubishi, Daihatsu and Honda still produce^[when?] models belonging to the\nKei car category.^[12]\n\n## Handling the Japanese Gal\u00e1pagos syndrome[edit]\n\nThere are many associated issues with the inability to compete on the\ninternational export market. In order to revive the parts of the Japanese\neconomy that have suffered from the \"Gal\u00e1pagosization\", affected businesses\nhad to find the reasons responsible for the development.\n\n> The Gal\u00e1pagosization of Japan continues. According to a survey released\n> today, a shocking two-thirds of the country\u2019s white-collar workers said they\n> didn\u2019t want to work abroad ... ever.^[13]\n\n### Reasons for the issue and associated implications for businesses[edit]\n\nFurthermore, this has led a number of Japanese companies to adapt their\nbusiness strategies. Hiroshi Mikitani, CEO of e-commerce company Rakuten, sees\nthe exclusive use of Japanese in workplaces at the centre of the problem.\nFollowing his belief that \"a language will open your eyes to the 'global', and\nyou will break free from this conventional wisdom of a pure Japan\",^[14] the\nco-founder and CEO of Rakuten made English the main language to be spoken in\nthe company. Gerhard Fasol, the only European member of Euro Technology\nJapan's \"Galapagos study group\", stated that another reason for the non-\nsuccess of some innovative Japanese products is Europe's conservative\nstandpoint when it comes to certain standards.^[15] In the belief that it will\nimprove international competitiveness Tadashi Yanai, the founder and president\nof Fast Retailing, has decided to change the way the firm works against\nclassical Japanese business methods. A shift of the production of some\ntextiles out of Japan to Southeast Asia was a move to the low-wage-labour\nmarket, that aimed to enable them to compete on price in the international\ntextile market.^[16] Another factor which McKinsey & Company points out is the\nneed for Japanese companies to adapt to stronger competition when entering\nglobal markets. This should be done by accepting to think in \"new and\nunfamiliar ways about organization, marketing, and strategy\", whilst the\ntraditional practices that helped the companies to become a big player in the\nJapanese market shall be discontinued.^[17] Despite the fact that companies\nhave started to address the issue, which could have a link to the total value\nof exports increasing over the past five years, there are^[when?] concerns\nabout the future Gal\u00e1pagosization of Japan.^[18]\n\n### Future threats[edit]\n\nWith the ageing and shrinking Japanese population, the fact that fewer and\nfewer students study abroad to acquire a more internationally oriented\nuniversity education is reason for concerns over the future of the Japanese\neconomy. Furthermore, there is a conception that the younger generation could\nenhance the Gal\u00e1pagos effect due to a lack of interest in international\neducation and work placements.^[19] Kiyoshi Takeuchi, sociology professor at\nthe Sophia university, describes the young generation to have less \"ambition\nand motivation\" as a result from the fear that a wrong move could have\nnegative effects.^[20]\n\n## Usage of the term referring to instances outside Japan[edit]\n\n### China[edit]\n\n  * Stephen Ezell and Robert D. Atkinson describe a similar phenomenon pointing out associated threats this could mean for the Chinese economy. The selling of a product in China could become more expensive for foreign producers due to the fact that they now have to incorporate the Chinese technology standards into their firm. In theory, this could be beneficial for domestic producers. However, this could also lead to an isolation of the respective domestic producers due to less international competitiveness. \"China has made the development of indigenous technology standards ... a core component of its industrial development strategy. ... But, by using indigenous rather than global technology standards for ICT products, China risks engendering a 'Galapagos Island' effect that isolates Chinese ICT products, technologies, and markets.\"^[21]^[22]\n\n### Europe[edit]\n\n  * Mark Leonard describes threats of how, against the predictions he made in 2005 in his book Why Europe Will Run the 21st Century, the political development of the European Union happened isolated and differently than in any other political system in the world. \"Europe might now be facing its own 'Gal\u00e1pagos moment.' ... It may be that Europe\u2019s postmodern order has become so advanced and particular to its environment that it is impossible for others to follow. It evolved in a protective ecosystem, shielded from the more muscular, \"modern\" world where most people live.\"^[23]\n\n### United States[edit]\n\n  * The United States was slow to adopt the EMV standard for credit and debit cards (as opposed to swiped magnetic stripe cards), which have been widely-adopted elsewhere, with merchants citing the cost of upgrading hardware and other systems to support it. Work to encourage transition began in 2015 following a series of high-profile retail data breaches involving credit card data, as well as increased frustration by travelers who found themselves increasingly inconvenienced when travelling abroad where they have phased out the magnetic stripe or where automated kiosks abroad would not accept non-EMV chipped cards. Payment providers implemented deadlines under which liability for fraud would shift to merchants if they did not begin accepting EMV payments by a specific date. As of April 2016, 70% of U.S. consumers had EMV cards, and around half of merchants were EMV compliant as of December 2016. However, the rollout has faced challenges, including merchants with EMV-compatible hardware that do not support EMV transactions due to a lack of certification or software support, and complaints that chip-based transactions took more time to process than swipe cards.^[24]^[25]^[26]^[27]\n  * According to a March 2008 Financial Times article, American-made cars suffered from the Galapagos syndrome, as they evolved separately from those of the global marketplace.^[28]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Big in Japan (phrase)\n  * Commoditization\n  * Exceptionalism\n  * In-group favouritism\n  * Invented here\n  * Island gigantism\n  * Not invented here\n  * World famous in New Zealand\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Tabuchi, Hiroko (19 July 2009). \"Why Japan's Cellphones Haven't Gone Global\".
