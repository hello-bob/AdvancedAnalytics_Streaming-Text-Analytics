Its scope and past activities includes standardization of part\nnumbers, defining an electrostatic discharge (ESD) standard, and leadership in\nthe lead-free manufacturing transition.^[1]\n\nThe origin of JEDEC traces back to 1944, when RMA (subsequently renamed EIA)\nand NEMA established the Joint Electron Tube Engineering Council (JETEC) to\ncoordinate vacuum tube type numberings.\n\nIn 1958, with the advent of semiconductor technology, the joint JETEC-activity\nof EIA and NEMA was renamed into Joint Electron Device Engineering\nCouncil.^[1] NEMA discontinued its involvement in 1979. In the fall of 1999,\nJEDEC became a separate trade association under the current name, but\nmaintained an EIA alliance, until EIA ceased operations in 2011.\n\n## History[edit]\n\nAn early 1950s transistor using the precursor to the EIA/JEDEC part numbering\nsystem\n\nThe origin of JEDEC can be traced back to 1944, when the Radio Manufacturers\nAssociation (RMA), and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association\n(NEMA) established the Joint Electron Tube Engineering Council (JETEC) to\ncoordinate vacuum tube type numberings. The expansion of the radio industry\ncaused JETEC to expand its scope to include solid-state devices and develop\nstandards for semiconductor devices. Eventually, the joint JETEC activity of\nEIA and NEMA was renamed into Joint Electron Device Engineering Council\n(JEDEC) in 1958.^[1] NEMA discontinued its involvement in 1979.\n\nEarlier in the 20th century, the organization was known as JETEC, the Joint\nElectron Tube Engineering Council, and was responsible for assigning and\ncoordinating RETMA tube designations to electron tubes (also called valves).\nThe type 6L6, still to be found in electric-guitar amplifiers, typically has a\ntype number that was assigned by JETEC.\n\nIn the fall of 1999, JEDEC became a separate trade association under the\ncurrent name, but maintained an EIA alliance.\n\n## Standards policies[edit]\n\nJEDEC has adopted the principle of open standards, which permit any and all\ninterested companies to freely manufacture in compliance with adopted\nstandards. This serves several vital functions for the advancement of\nelectronic technologies. First and foremost, such standards allow for\ninteroperability between different electrical components. JEDEC standards do\nnot protect members from normal patent obligations. The designated\nrepresentatives of JEDEC member companies are required to disclose patents and\npatent applications of which they are aware, assuming that this information is\nnot considered proprietary. JEDEC patent policy requires that standards found\nto contain patented technology, whose owners do not sign a standard JEDEC\npatent letter, be withdrawn. Thus the penalty for a failure to disclose\npatents is retraction of the standard. Typically, standards are not adopted to\ncover technology that are subject to patent protection. In rare circumstances,\nstandards covered by a patent may be adopted, but only on the understanding\nthat the patent owner will not enforce such patent rights or, at a minimum,\nthat the patent owner will provide a reasonable and non-discriminatory license\nto the patented technology.^[2]\n\n## Part numbers[edit]\n\nJEDEC's early work began as a part numbering system for devices which became\npopular in the 1960s. The first semiconductor devices, such as the 1N23\nsilicon point contact diode, were still designated in the old RMA tube\ndesignation system, where the \"1\" stood for \"No filament/heater\" and the \"N\"\nstood for \"crystal rectifier\". The first RMA digit thus was re-allocated from\n\"heater power\" to \"p-n junction count\" to form the new EIA/JEDEC EIA-370\nstandard; for example, the 1N4001 rectifier diode and 2N2222 transistor part\nnumbers came from EIA-370. They are still popular today. In February 1982,\nJEDEC issued JESD370B, superseding the original EIA-370 and introducing a new\nletter symbol \"C\" that denotes the die version, as opposed to \"N\", now meaning\nthe packaged version. The Japanese JIS semiconductor designation system\nemploys a similar pattern. JEDEC later developed a numbering system for\nintegrated circuits, but this did not gain acceptance in the semiconductor\nindustry. The European Pro Electron semiconductor numbering system originated\nin a similar way from the older Mullard\u2013Philips tube designation.\n\n## Test methods and product standards[edit]\n\nThis early work was followed by a number of test methods, JESD22, and product\nstandards. For example, the ESD caution symbol, which is the hand with the\nline drawn through it, was published by JEDEC and is used worldwide. JEDEC\nalso has a dictionary of semiconductor terms. All of JEDEC standards are free\non the Web for downloading after a free registration.\n\nJEDEC has issued widely used standards for device interfaces, such as the\nJEDEC memory standards for computer memory (RAM), including the DDR SDRAM\nstandards.\n\n## Semiconductor package drawings[edit]\n\nJEDEC also developed a number of popular package drawings for semiconductors\nsuch as TO-3, TO-5, etc. These are on the web under JEP-95. One hot issue is\nthe development of lead-free packages that do not suffer from the tin whiskers\nproblem that reappeared since the recent ban on lead content. JEDEC is working\nwith iNEMI on a joint interest group on lead-free issues.\n\n## Members[edit]\n\nAs of 2023, JEDEC has 365 members in total. Among them are large companies,\nwhich include the following.^[3]\n\n  * ABB\n  * Alibaba\n  * AMD\n  * Apple\n  * Arm\n  * Buffalo\n  * Canon\n  * Facebook\n  * Foxconn\n  * Fujitsu\n  * Google\n  * Kioxia \u2013 formerly Toshiba Memory Corporation\n  * LG\n  * Marvell\n  * Micron\n  * Microsoft\n  * NEC\n  * Nokia\n  * Nvidia\n  * NXP\n  * Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n  * HP Inc.\n  * Huawei\n  * IBM\n  * Infineon\n  * Intel\n  * Panasonic\n  * Qualcomm\n  * Realtek\n  * Samsung Electronics\n  * SK Hynix\n  * Sony\n  * Texas Instruments\n  * TSMC\n  * Western Digital\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c \"JEDEC History\". jedec.org.
