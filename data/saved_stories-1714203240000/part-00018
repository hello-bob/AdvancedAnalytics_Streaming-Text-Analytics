Hubble\u2019s instruments are stable, and the telescope is in good\nhealth.\n\nThe telescope automatically entered safe mode when one of its three gyroscopes\ngave faulty readings. The gyros measure the telescope\u2019s turn rates and are\npart of the system that determines which direction the telescope is pointed.\nWhile in safe mode, science operations are suspended, and the telescope waits\nfor new directions from the ground.\n\nThis particular gyro caused Hubble to enter safe mode in November after\nreturning similar faulty readings. The team is currently working to identify\npotential solutions. If necessary, the spacecraft can be re-configured to\noperate with only one gyro, with the other remaining gyro placed in reserve .\nThe spacecraft had six new gyros installed during the fifth and final space\nshuttle servicing mission in 2009. To date, three of those gyros remain\noperational, including the gyro currently experiencing fluctuations. Hubble\nuses three gyros to maximize efficiency, but could continue to make science\nobservations with only one gyro if required.\n\nNASA anticipates Hubble will continue making groundbreaking discoveries,\nworking with other observatories, such as the agency\u2019s James Webb Space\nTelescope, throughout this decade and possibly into the next.\n\nLaunched in 1990, Hubble has been observing the universe for more than three\ndecades and recently celebrated its 34th anniversary.
