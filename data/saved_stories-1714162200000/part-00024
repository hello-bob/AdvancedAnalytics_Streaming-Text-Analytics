But when I look at the broader economy, I struggle to find\n> examples of transformative change I can write about.\n\nAs of today, large language models (LLMs) are exciting the technology elites,\nbut they have not had any mass-market impact. Ordinary households are not\nmaking use of the models. The business world seems to think of the models as\nresearch tools, whereas I think of them as human-computer communication tools.\n\nEthan Mollick is expecting democratization of innovation to emerge.\n\n> The lesson of innovation is that technology is only really useful when it is\n> used. This might seem like a tautology, but it isn\u2019t. When a new technology\n> is introduced, people adapt it to solve the needs they have at hand, rather\n> than simply following what the manufacturer of the technology intended. This\n> leads to a lot of unexpected uses as the new technology is pushed to solve\n> all sorts of novel problems. Right now, AI is in the hands of millions of\n> educators, and they can use it to solve their own problems, in their own\n> classrooms.\n>\n> [but] I have yet to see robust communities of educators (or many other\n> professions) coming together to share what they create.\n\nEmphasis added, because the sentence echoes Amar Bhide\u2019s concept of\nventuresome consumers.\n\nBut are these models really \u201cin the hands of millions of educators?\u201d I suspect\nthat fewer educators have access, and of those hardly any have the time and\nthe imagination to make good use of the models.\n\nLLMs have not yet broken through to the mass market. This reminds me of the\nWorld Wide Web before Netscape.\n\nTim Berners-Lee proposed the World Wide Web protocol in 1989. His vision was\nfor a text-based linking system suitable to academics sharing research.\n\nUntil 1993, the Web remained in that state, uninteresting to ordinary people.\nThen the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of\nIllinois released Mosaic, a web browser with a more exciting vision. It could\nbe installed on personal computers, and it included graphics.\n\nSerial entrepreneur Jim Clark1 soon hired Marc Andreessen and other Illini to\ncreate a commercial version of Mosaic, which came to be called Netscape. This\ncompany had a vision of making the Web commercial and bringing it to the\nmasses. They succeeded in that vision, even though they faltered as a\ncompany.2\n\nBut there were other important companies that enabled mass participation in\nthe Web. eBay allowed millions of people to become merchants. GeoCities\nencouraged many households to build web sites, and in 1997 it became the 5th\nmost popular web site.\n\nI think that LLMs are missing these sorts of intermediaries. We are waiting\nfor someone to come up with a Netscape, an eBay, and a GeoCities for large\nlanguage models.\n\nShare\n\nsubstacks referenced above:\n\n@\n\nDon't Worry About the Vase\n\nAI #60: Oh the Humanity\n\nMany things this week did not go as planned.

A lot of technologists don't seem to understand this, but tech products\nare not used by the masses because the tech is cool. Tech products are used by\nthe masses when the tech is easy for normal people to use. And, while ChatGPT\nor Claude 3's chat interface is miles easier to use than arcane HTTP command\nline interfaces that were common before Netscape came on the scene, it is\n*still* hard for normal people to understand how to interact with this tech.\nYes, as Ethan Mollick has repeatedly said, if you sit in front of your\ncomputer for a few hours playing with the tools, you will figure it out, but\neven that learning curve is far too steep for most people to traverse.Expand\nfull commentLike (1)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nluciaphile37 mins ago\u00b7edited 37 mins agoI am savagely indifferent to it\nmyself, but if I were to venture a guess, it\u2019s arrived at a moment when the\npeople are less verbal in terms of being able to read or write, than a few\ndecades ago.
