The\nsediment will eventually build up against the dam and could affect its safe\noperation and lead to its failure.^[1]\n\nThe dam, anchored in unstable^[citation needed] Navajo sandstone (sometimes\nsaid to be \"solidified sand dunes\"),^[2] nearly failed in 1983 as the result\nof a flood on the upper Colorado River that led to extended use of its tunnel\nspillways. The spillways, designed for short-term use, soon underwent\ncavitation and began to fail. Emergency installation of 8-foot (2.4 m)\nflashboards and other efforts narrowly averted total failure.\n\nSiltation, concrete degradation, spillway operational problems, and unstable\ndam abutments are all key factors that affect the safe operation of the\ndam.^[3]^[failed verification] It is estimated that a breach of the dam would\nproduce a floodwave that would overtop the Hoover Dam.^[1]^[4] The dam's\nuseful lifespan has been estimated by some to be 85 to 100 years, and was\ndescribed as \"America's most regretted environmental mistake\" by David Brower,\nthen-head of the Sierra Club.^[5] Different estimates by the Bureau of\nReclamation and others suggest a lifespan of between 500\u2013700 years.^[6]\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\nMain article: Glen Canyon Dam\n\nGlen Canyon Dam is a concrete arch dam on the Colorado River in northern\nArizona in the United States, just north of Page. The dam was built to provide\nhydroelectricity and regulate the flow of the river from the upper Colorado\nRiver Basin into the lower. The Lake Powell reservoir is the second largest\nartificial lake in the country, extending upriver well into Utah. The dam is\nnamed for Glen Canyon, a colorful series of gorges, most of which now are\nburied under the reservoir.\n\nConstruction of Glen Canyon Dam began in 1956 and was finished in 1966. When\nthe reservoir filled, the dam began to deliver a steady, regulated flow of\nwater downstream and generate a cheap, plentiful supply of electricity. In\n1983, major floods nearly destroyed the two tunnel spillways that could have\nled to the dam's collapse, but disaster was averted by a close margin. By\ntaming floods that were characteristic of the Colorado River, the dam has led\nto major physical and ecological changes in the lower river. Controversy\ncontinues over the positive and negative effects of the dam.\n\n## Siltation[edit]\n\nThe neutrality of this section is disputed. Relevant discussion may be found\non the talk page.

(June 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)  \n---  \n  \nThe Colorado River carries an estimated 45 million tons of sediment annually\nat Glen Canyon,^[7] and as Lake Powell is the farthest large reservoir\nupstream on the Colorado River mainstem,^[8] the sediment load is completely\ntrapped in the reservoir as the Colorado discharges into it. This sediment is\ncreating a steadily advancing \"toe\" of sediment, i.e. an underwater alluvial\nfan, that is advancing towards the dam. Some estimates by conservationists\npredict that the sediment will reach the dam base in about 80 to 100 years,\nwhile others made primarily by government agencies estimate it will take as\nlong as 500 to 700 years.^[1] It will take still longer for the sediment to\naccumulate to the point where it could clog the outlet works, which are the\nlowest openings in the upstream face of the dam.^[1]\n\nSome critics predict that if the water level then drops, it may fall below the\npenstock openings, which are higher up on the dam face, which will cause the\nrelease capacity of the dam to drop to zero. This would dewater the Colorado\nRiver bed below the dam which would remain dry until the next major spring\ninflow. Only springs, seeps and tributaries such as the Paria, Little Colorado\nand Virgin River would supply the river flow during these times, perhaps\ncausing unprecedented drops in levels of Lake Mead as well.^[1]\n\nThe primary failure mode for Glen Canyon dam will likely be an overtopping one\nspring caused by insufficient storage capacity (either a huge inflow, bigger\nthan 1983, or insufficient storage capacity because the lake was too full of\neither water or sediment).^[citation needed]\n\nColorado River Delta today, showing inflows mostly from the Hardy River and\nother Mexican tributaries\n\nAn example of the fast deposition rate of Colorado River sediment is found in\nLake Mead itself, where, before the completion of Glen Canyon Dam, ten percent\nof its storage was already compromised by sediment. When Lake Powell levels\ndrop, sediments deposited in its upper reaches are carried into the receding\nwater by the Colorado and its tributaries. One large flash flood caused by\nheavy rainfall could move all or most of these sediments into Lake Powell,\ncreating a sudden loss of storage capacity. One way to control sediment flow\nin the reservoir, without removing the dam outright, is by dredging.^[9]\n\n## 1983\u201384 flooding[edit]\n\nIn May 1983, three years after Lake Powell was first filled, an unusually\nlong-lasting winter due to the 1982\u201383 El Ni\u00f1o event produced increased\nsnowfall over the entire 108,335-square-mile (280,590 km^2) multi-state\nColorado River basin. Dam engineers anticipated a normal winter, and\nmaintained reservoir levels at their usual levels through the winter.^[10]\n\n### Inflow capacity[edit]\n\nSpring ended with a sudden influx of warm weather and then rain. The\ncombination of rain and snowmelt eventually produced a combined inflow into\nLake Powell of over 111,500 cubic feet (3,160 m^3) per second.^[11]\n\nThe average annual peak flow prior to 1963 was 93,400 cubic feet (2,640 m^3)\nper second.^[12] The Bureau of Reclamation predicts that the probable maximum\nflood at Glen Canyon is 697,000 cubic feet (19,700 m^3) per second, almost\nseven times the 1983 total. ^[6]\n\n### Outflow capacity[edit]\n\nGlen Canyon Dam has two tunnel spillways capable of allowing 276,000 cu ft/s\n(7,815 m^3/s) to bypass the dam's regular spillways.^[13] The spillway tunnels\nwere excavated around both abutments of the dam, dropping steeply from their\ncontrol gates on Lake Powell to connect with the lower reaches of the\ndiversion tunnels, which were utilized as the lower ends of the dam's\nspillways. This measure saved cost, but introduced a weak point at the elbow\nwhere the two tunnels intersected. The upper ends of the diversion tunnels\nwere then sealed with a solid concrete \"plug\".^[14]\n\nWhile this made the spillways more economical to construct, they had less\ncapacity in part because engineers must maintain at least 30 percent clearance\nbetween the water level and the tunnel ceiling.^[15] in addition to the tunnel\nspillways, the dam has a set of river outlet works designed to release 15,000\ncubic feet (420 m^3) per second.^[6] The dam also releases water through the\ndam's power turbines, which are capable of releasing 31,500 cubic feet (890\nm^3) per second.^[16] The official spillway capacity is 208,000 cu ft/s (5,900\nm^3/s).^[17]\n\n### Tunnel spillways damaged[edit]\n\nThe releases from Glen Canyon Dam in May 1983\n\nAt first, as inflows exceeded normal levels, the US Bureau of Reclamation\nengineers opened penstocks to full release. When inflow rates continued to\nrise, they also opened the river outlet works. The reservoir continued to\nrise.\n\nReclamation Bureau officials met in late June and agreed that the maximum\nwater level the dam could handle was 3,708 feet (1,130 m). At that level they\nfeared they could not control the spillway gates.^[10] The engineers decided\nto raise the floodgates controlling the tunnel spillways. This became the\nfirst time that the spillways had ever been used for their intended purpose.\nVolume initially ran at 20,000 cubic feet (570 m^3) per second per tunnel.\nAfter several days, noticeable vibrations were felt in the dam wall and\nsurrounding rock. Water exiting the spillways contained noticeable debris,\nincluding sandstone, signaling severe erosion taking place within the\ntunnels.^[18]\n\nReclamation responded by reducing releases by half, however, the rumblings\ncontinued. The noise was so noticeable that a worker in the employee dining\nroom, located near the power plant, reported that it \"sounded like the\nbarrages that he had experienced in Vietnam\".^[18] The engineers soon closed\nthe spillways for an inspection.^[15]\n\n### Cavitation damage found[edit]\n\nInspection crews were lowered down the spillway tunnels in a small cart to\nassess damage. They found that cavitation, a known risk associated with tunnel\nspillways, had severely damaged and eroded the 3-foot (0.91 m)-thick concrete\ntunnel lining. In some locations the cavitation had exposed the soft\nsandstone.\n\nThe tunnels could not be kept closed as more rain fell in the Colorado River\nBasin and the reservoir continued to rise. Reclamation reopened the left\nspillway, allowing 12,000 cubic feet (340 m^3) per second; the right, which\nhad suffered worse damage, was only permitted to carry 4,000 cubic feet (110\nm^3) per second.\n\n### Emergency flashboards installed[edit]\n\nAs the reservoir level increased, plywood flashboards were installed on top of\nthe spillway gates. They allowed reservoir water to rise 4 feet (1.2 m)\nwithout increasing releases.\n\n### Tunnels damaged further[edit]\n\nThe left tunnel, however, was suffering further damage, described as a\n\"surging, boiling flow that filled the portal\".^[15] The tunnel had formed a\nhydraulic jump as it was turned into a \"pressure conduit\" by the surging flow\nof water. The interior erosion threatened to collapse the tunnel. Engineers\nknew that increasing the flow would decrease the turbulence but would further\ndamage to the tunnel walls. To increase the reservoir's capacity further,\nengineers began an emergency effort to add 8 feet (2.4 m) to the height of the\nspillway gates, avoiding increasing the rate of water releases.^[15]\n\nSpillway gates at Glen Canyon Dam during 1983 flood. Note the flashboards\ninstalled atop to prevent water from overtopping the gates.\n\n### Diversion tunnel threatened[edit]\n\nThe force of the water at the left tunnel eroded concrete near the diversion\nplug, a device that blocked the diversion tunnel used during construction. The\nBureau of Reclamation was concerned that the water would eventually erode the\ndiversion plug altogether, creating a connection to the reservoir floor. This\nuncontrolled spillage would cause the reservoir to drain, creating a\ncatastrophe.\n\nAs the discharges from Glen Canyon Dam reached almost 90,000 cubic feet (2,500\nm^3) per second, with 32,000 cubic feet (910 m^3) per second racing through\nthe left spillway,^[11] the 9,500,000 acre-feet (11.7 km^3) of flood storage\nspace behind Hoover Dam downstream was exhausted.^[19]\n\n### Lake Powell reaches peak level[edit]\n\nOn July 15, 1983, Lake Powell reached its peak level, 3,708.34 feet (1,130.30\nm) about 8 inches (200 mm) from where engineers thought they'd lose control.\nThe water held steady for a few days and then gradually declined.^[10] Inflows\nto Lake Powell topped 120,000 cubic feet (3,400 m^3) per second,^[11]^[18]\nwhile releases from Glen Canyon Dam topped 92,000 cubic feet (2,600 m^3) per\nsecond. Eventually, Hoover Dam was also forced to open its gates; its\ndischarge peaked at 40,000 cubic feet (1,100 m^3) per second and still caused\ndownstream flooding. As inflow lessened at the end of the season, dam\nengineers were able to draw Lake Powell down below critical levels.\n\n### Tunnel spillways seriously damaged[edit]\n\nGlen Canyon Dam during the 1984 flood\n\nInspections of both spillways found severe damage. In the more badly damaged\nleft spillway, inspection crews discovered a 32 feet (9.8 m) deep, 40 feet (12\nm) wide, and 150 feet (46 m) long hole.^[11]^[15]^[18]\n\n### Repairs and solutions[edit]\n\nAfter the flood, it was suggested that the flashboards atop the spillway gates\nshould be replaced with stronger boards and kept permanently; this would allow\nan \"insurance\" against a 1983-reminiscent flood.^[16]\n\n### Air slots added to tunnels[edit]\n\nResearch by the Bureau of Reclamation found that an air slot at a specific\npoint in each spillway tunnel would introduce air bubbles that would prevent\ncavitation and resultant shockwaves. Spillway upgrades and repairs commenced\nimmediately after the 1983 floods receded and continued through the winter of\n1983\u201384. Through the winter, heavy snowpack was reported in the upper Colorado\nbasin. It was feared that this would produce a flood greater than the 1983\none, and as the spillway repairs continued, water was constantly released\nthrough the dam power plant and outlet works, a rate of roughly 45,000 cubic\nfeet (1,300 m^3) per second. ^[20]\n\n### 1984 floods possible[edit]\n\nThe engineers allowed Lake Powell's level to fall to allow for the next\nwinter's snowmelt. When the snowpack began to melt in spring of 1984, water\nlevels reached several inches below the top of the flashboards in late June.\nAs summer continued, inflows decreased and the reservoir level began to\ndecrease.\n\nOn August 12, 1984, construction teams completed repairs to the left spillway.\nIt was tested at 50,000 cubic feet (1,400 m^3) per second for several days. No\nnoticeable damage was found in the spillways.^[21]\n\nLake Powell with \"bathtub ring\"\n\n### Aftermath[edit]\n\nThe 1983 flood, although it nearly caused a catastrophic disaster, was a\n\"relatively small flood\".^[22] It was, in fact, only a 25-year flood, or a\nflood that has a four percent chance of occurring in any given year.^[11]^[18]\n\n### Impact of dam failure[edit]\n\nIn 1990, the Bureau of Reclamation prepared a study of a Glen Canyon Dam\nfailure. They predicted that if Lake Powell were at high pool, about\n27,000,000 acre-feet (33 km^3) of water would surge out of Lake Powell at an\ninitial depth of over 500 feet (150 m). Downstream communities and possibly\nevery dam along the river, including Hoover Dam forming Lake Mead, Davis Dam\nforming Lake Mohave, Parker Dam forming Lake Havasu, Palo Verde Dam, and other\ndams and reservoirs, as well as riverside lowlands, would be inundated or\nseverely damaged.^[8] The resulting flood would scour the bottom few hundred\nfeet of the Grand Canyon.^[1]\n\nGlen Canyon Dam is the central element of the Colorado River Storage Project.\nIf it failed, the resulting damage could limit or completely cut off water\nsupply to residences or farmlands along the Colorado River, and depending on\ndamage to canal headworks, even cut off water to southern California.^[8]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d ^e ^f Haskell, Dave. \"Creating a Sustainable Future\".
