We invited artists that don\u2019t maintain exclusive GIF-\nbased practices, but whose work is engaged with digital art and technology, as\nwell as analogue media such as illustration, painting, writing, and kinetic\nsculpture.\n\nWhile some artists chose to respond to the nostalgia that early internet GIFs\noften evoke, other artists situate their GIFs within complex worlds of the\npresent, the GIF becoming a tool that helps unfold a larger narrative. Others\nexperimented with the medium to make sense of physical projects, the GIF\nserving as a digital interpretation of a physical artwork or phenomenon. These\nworks represent only a sliver of the countless ways that artists are\ncontinuing to experiment with GIFs as sites for creative expression today.\n\nGIFs are available to share on GIPHY and have been accessioned to the Rhizome\nArtBase\u2014our archive of over 2,200 works of born-digital art.\n\nsee the collection on GIPHY\n\nView the works in ArtBase\n\nKeep Scrolling to view GIFs are a flat circle, with works by Balfua, Ta\u00edna\nCruz, Scott Gelber, Mas Guerrero, Teng Yung Han, Liby Hays, Daylen Seu,\nNichole Shinn, Tyler Cala Williams, and Harrison Wyrick.\n\nGIFs are a flat circle is curated by Kayla Drzewicki, Program Coordinator,\nRhizome.\n\nContent Warning: A work in this project contains nudity.\n\nBalfua\n\n## Balfua, Gozentilade Fuckiffilai above the Mountain\n\nView the work on ArtBase\n\n\u201cBalfua creates artwork from within his fantastical spirit world, the\nSayssiworld. The Sayssiworld is populated by personified sculptures called\nslollas. In this 3D video-painting, an ancient, mischievous, and monstrous\nslolla known as Gozentilade Fuckiffilai hovers above a lone mountain waiting\nto surprise unsuspecting travelers.\u201c\n\nsambalfus.com\n\nTa\u00edna Cruz\n\n## Ta\u00edna Cruz, Motor Hound\n\nView the work on ArtBase\n\n\u201cMotor Hound is a sculptural object that incorporates a rotary motor, a rubber\nLabrador dog head, and an oversized tennis ball. I wanted to use this\nopportunity to integrate one of my physical objects into the realm of internet\nart.\n\nThe inspiration for this GIF stemmed from the repetitive motion of the\nphysical rotary motor, reminiscent of a looping GIF. The motor's movement\nresembled that of a dog, and I found it amusing to envision it persistently\nattempting to run after the oversized tennis ball.\u201d\n\ntainacruz.com\n\nScott Gelber\n\n## Scott Gelber, source vision\n\nView the work on ArtBase\n\n\u201cSource Vision refers to an experience I had visualizing \u2018the source of\neverything.\u2019 This work is an attempt to illustrate that vision wrapped in the\naesthetic of my early experiences, creating digital art in 1-bit painting\nprograms like MacPaint.\u201d\n\nscottgelber.com\n\nMas Guerrero\n\n## Mas Guerrero, Conversation Pit\n\nView the work on ArtBase\n\n\u201cThis GIF is a ghost story, a void of failed Feng Shui. Like the mock-up\nrenderings created by contractors when a new home or public space is being\nbuilt; unnatural spills of light and perspectives make very little sense when\nhuman images are implemented. Structurally palatial architecture harking back\nto a vapid but inornate Rococo interior. You're seeing just the smallest\nsnippet of a labyrinthian, suburban American home; needlessly sprawling but\nspiritually claustrophobic. Inanimate objects working as sponges of extreme\nhuman emotion, fumbling to grasp at a sense of comfort and status via\npossessions and excess. An \"if these walls could talk\" scenario with the\ntension softened, reckoned with by digestible cartoon depictions of manmade\nsadness and profitable unease. One of the many Pyramids erected in the Pyramid\nScheme of Western Exceptionalism, the ones getting emptier, decaying every\nday. All this is a vulnerable, subconscious projection, haunting not only what\noccupies the home, but how the home ultimately functions.\u201d\n\nTeng Yung Han\n\n## Teng Yung Han, Note\n\nView the work on ArtBase\n\n\u201cShe contemplates themes about movement, only moving forward by going\nbackward.\u201d\n\ntengyunghan.com\n\nLiby Hays\n\n## Liby Hays, Ambidextrous Pantograph\n\nView the work on ArtBase\n\n\u201cA pantograph is a mechanical linkage for duplicating and enlarging plans.\nThis version is anthropomorphized, showcasing the typical human left\nhand/right hand discrepancy in fine motor control.\u201d\n\nlibyhays.net\n\nDaylen Seu\n\n## Daylen Seu, Trust Focused\n\nView the work on ArtBase\n\n\u201cTrust Focused is an animated GIF that came to be from sketchbook explorations\nand my own feelings on animating. When overthinking and overplanning leads to\nbarely anything.\u201d\n\ndaylenseu.com\n\nTyler Cala Williams\n\n## Tyler Cala Williams, Untitled\n\nView the work on ArtBase\n\n\u201cEmbodiment for some can feel like a kind of cosmic sentence. Unwillingly,\nstuffed into confines, we find ourselves sliding and rolling around hoping to\ndiscover at least a few comfortable positions to rest in. It\u2019s never really\ncomfortable, I know that, well at least using the folding instructions they\ngave me. It's a fucked obligation, a sisyphus task no(body) can escape from.\nBending, tucking, and folding what is seen is the best we got, it is the best\nof what we\u2019ve been given. Reflecting on the words of Akwaeke Emezi in Dear\nSenthuran (\u201cThey had their reasons, but you can\u2019t keep things like us folded\nfor too long, the creases can\u2019t hold. I know you\u2019ve felt the seams bursting,\ntoo, how much it hurts, how terrifying we are, they must\u2019ve folded us for a\nreason, we\u2019re going to hurt the humans if we expand fully, we\u2019re going to burn\neveryone we care about, we burn too bright, it\u2019s not safe to exist, we\u2019re\ndangerous, we\u2019re dangerous, we\u2019re dangerous!\u201d) disillusioned me.\nComfortability isn\u2019t an option for something like me. Just constant motion.\u201d\n\nHarrison Wyrick\n\n## Harrison Wyrick, face, spider, tomato\n\nView the work on ArtBase\n\n\u201cThe ideas for most of my art come to me seconds before I fall asleep and I\nusually have to frantically grab my phone and draw them quickly in my notes-\napp before I forget. From the start of this project I knew I wanted to draw\nneon green space alien freaks cause they've been on my mind a lot lately.\u201d\n\nharrisonwyrick.com\n\nNichole Shinn\n\n## Nichole Shinn, Feeling Something...\n\nView the work on ArtBase\n\n\u201cThis GIF is an homage to the goofy, quirky and sometimes dark-humored early\ninternet low-poly animated 3D GIFs. In a culture of artificial happiness and\nputting on a smile to get through the day while the world is burning, allowing\nyourself to feel tough emotions is critical.\u201d\n\nnicholeshinn.com\n\n", "frontpage": false}
