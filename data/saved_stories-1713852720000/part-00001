The matter is now in mediation\nin the federal court.\n\nSo neither party is a stranger to legal action.\n\n## What can the government do about X's refusal to take down content?\n\nAt the moment, it is doing everything within its current powers through the\neSafety commissioner and the Australian Communications and Media Authority\n(ACMA).\n\nMajor digital platforms in Australia are signatories to the DIGI Voluntary\nCode on Misinformation and Disinformation but X was removed from the code late\nlast year for repeated breaches.\n\nThe government's online safety act gives the eSafety commissioner broad powers\nto order the removal of material that promotes, incites or instructs people in\ncrime or violence. And, the eSafety commission can usually remove content\nspecifically in Australia by geoblocking it.\n\nOn Monday, eSafety argued in court that geoblocking was insufficient in this\ncase and sought for its order to be upheld.\n\nA spokesperson for Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said the\ngovernment was united with eSafety in its \"very clear expectation\" that social\nmedia companies remove the violent content relating to this most recent\nstabbing \"immediately\".\n\n\"Our message to Australians is please do not share or engage with this\ncontent. It is distressing and may very well cause harm to vulnerable\nAustralians \u2014 including children,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe eSafety Commission also asked Meta to take down the violent videos and it\ncomplied.\n\n## The misinformation bill\n\nAnd it isn't just violent videos the government is worried about.\n\nLast week, immediately after the Bondi Junction stabbing attack, a man was\nwrongly named as the perpetrator by X users and eventually a commercial media\noutlet. The Sydney university student, Benjamin Cohen, is still considering\nlegal action.\n\nThe federal government's proposal of strengthening the ACMA would give it the\npower to investigate the systems and processes utilised by digital platforms\nto address harmful and false information, and impose mandatory rules if their\nprocesses were found to be inadequate. But, under the legislation, ACMA would\nnot have the power to demand posts be removed.\n\nThe legislation was delayed, and the government will now seek to introduce it\nto parliament later this year. However, it will need support from the\nCoalition, which the government hasn't received previously.\n\nFollowing the Sydney stabbings last week, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton on\nSunday said his party would support the misinformation laws if they struck the\n\"right balance\".\n\n### Misinformation over Bondi Junction killings\n\nBenjamin Cohen was falsely accused of the Bondi Junction stabbings. Here's how\nthe lie spread around the world.\n\nRead more\n\nIn response, a spokesperson for the communications minister said the\n\"Coalition has flip-flopped on its position since 2022, putting politics first\nand running an irresponsible 'bin the bill' campaign, instead of working to\nhold big tech to account and keep Australians safe online\".\n\n\"The government welcomes the mature and constructive engagement we've had with\nother key stakeholders during consultation on the bill, which we're working to\nrefine before its introduction into parliament this year,\" the spokesperson\nsaid.\n\nIn mid-March this year, the eSafety commissioner sent legal notices to Google-\nowned YouTube, Google, Meta's Instagram and Facebook, Telegram, WhatsApp,\nReddit and X demanding they show their measures to protect Australians from\nonline extremism.\n\nThe ABC has asked if it has received a response from any parties.\n\nPosted 4h ago4 hours agoMon 22 Apr 2024 at 6:59pm, updated 1h ago1 hours\nagoMon 22 Apr 2024 at 9:25pm\n\nShare\n\n  * Copy\n  * Facebook\n  * X (formerly Twitter)\n\nMore on:\n\n  * Australia\n  * Federal Government\n  * Government and Politics\n  * Information and Communication\n  * Internet\n  * Internet Culture\n  * Social Media\n\n## Top Stories\n\n  * ### On a patch of earth 'big as a Bunnings car park', renters get to muscle in on the solar boom\n\n  * ### Supermarket promotional labels accused of 'confusing' and 'potentially misleading' shoppers\n\n  * ### 'While salacious, does not matter': Porn star's claim under courtroom scrutiny as jurors hear openings in Trump's trial\n\n  * ### People in Australia's crystal meth underworld have a code of silence.
