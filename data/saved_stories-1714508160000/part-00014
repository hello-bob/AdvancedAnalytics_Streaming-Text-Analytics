G-A.\n\nNu\u00f1o Dom\u00ednguez\n\nApr 29, 2024 - 18:56 GMT+2\n\nThe study of Ecuadorian families with a rare disease known as Laron Syndrome\nhas just shown that a genetic mutation protects them from cardiovascular\ndiseases. Researchers believe that it is possible to search for a drug or a\ndiet that mimics these beneficial effects in order to combat diseases\nassociated with aging, such as cancer, in the general population.\n\nIn 1987, Ecuadorian endocrinologist Jaime Guevara-Aguirre began treating\npeople with Laron Syndrome who lived in isolated towns in the provinces of\nLoja and El Oro, in the south of the country, near the border with Peru. The\ndisease is characterized by a mutation in the growth hormone receptor gene\nthat causes short stature. People with this condition do not exceed 1.5 meters\n(4 ft 10 in) in height. The cause is a mutation of a single biochemical letter\n\u2014 a G instead of an A \u2014 in the very long sequence of three billion letters\nthat makes up the human genome. In these communities in Ecuador, endogamy is\ncommon, which has favored the spread of the syndrome. Even today, the\ninhabitants of these municipalities continue to have children without knowing\nif they will be born with Laron or not. In the family photos, affected parents\nare seen with their children of about 10 years of age, who are already taller\nthan them.\n\nIn a teleconference from Quito, Guevara-Aguirre apologizes ahead of time in\ncase communication is interrupted due to the blackouts that have been\nafflicting the country, which has been plunged into a spiral of violence and\ninstability. \u201cIn 1987 it took two days to get to these towns in my father\u2019s\n4x4, and to get to some of them you had to walk two or three more hours. It\nwas a very remote area, but the patients were fascinating,\u201d recalls Guevara-\nAguirre, of San Francisco de Quito University. Since then, he has diagnosed\nabout 100 affected people, approximately a third of all known cases in the\nworld.\n\nAfter two decades of follow-up, the doctor observed an enigmatic pattern:\nthere was hardly any cancer or diabetes in Laron\u2019s carriers, while their\napparently healthy relatives suffered from these ailments with the same\nfrequency as the rest of Ecuadorians. The doctor posited that Laron\u2019s mutation\nprotects against diseases related to aging. The matter caught the attention of\nthe biochemist Valter Longo, a researcher at the University of Southern\nCalifornia focused on the search for diets capable of stopping chronic\ndiseases.\n\nIn 2011 they showed that people affected by Laron produced less IGF-1, a\nprotein essential for childhood growth but which in adults also promotes\nuncontrolled cancer cell proliferation. In laboratory studies, mice with low\nlevels of this protein live up to 40% longer, suffer fewer tumors, and appear\nsmaller than normal.\n\nIn 2017, the pair of researchers published another study that pointed out that\nthis mutation also protects against neurodegenerative ailments. Although very\nfew affected people live beyond the age of 80, among those identified there\nwere no cases of Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia. While many of the relatives without\nthe mutation suffered and died from diseases related to aging, those affected\nby the syndrome died mainly from accidents or alcoholism, which is very common\nin these Andean communities.\n\nEcuadorians with Laron Syndrome together with Guevara-Aguirre (left) and\nLongo, at USC.J. G-A.\n\nIn their new work, the researchers posit that the Laron mutation also has a\nprotective effect against cardiovascular diseases. They studied 21 men with\nthe syndrome and 23 unaffected relatives. Carriers had lower glucose levels\nand blood pressure. Despite showing high levels of \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol, they\nhad much fewer arteriosclerosis plaques, according to the study, published in\nthe specialized journal Med.\n\n\u201cThis is the most important study of all,\u201d Longo emphasizes. \u201cSkeptics\nmaintained that the most common cause of death in these people was heart\nproblems, but we showed that this is not the case.\u201d Many of the patients in\nthe study are overweight or obese and lead a poor lifestyle, with high tobacco\nand alcohol consumption. \u201cThe worst thing is that we see that some of them\nfeel that they can do whatever they want because they are protected, which is\nobviously not the case,\u201d highlights the Italian-American biochemist, who has\nvisited these villages in Ecuador \u201cdozens of times.\u201d\n\nLongo highlights that diets that mimic fasting, which he himself has designed,\nlower IGF-1 levels in the circulation, the supposed cause of the beneficial\neffects observed both in animals and in people with Laron. Another of the\nauthors of the work, John Kopchick, from the University of Ohio, has shown\nthat several molecules that block the growth hormone receptor slow tumor\nprogression in mice and in human breast cancer cells, and improve the\neffectiveness of conventional treatments. One of these molecules is\nPegvisomant, an already approved drug manufactured by the multinational Pfizer\nto treat acromegaly, a hormonal imbalance that causes excessive growth of the\nface and extremities.\n\nThe Israeli doctor Zvi Laron discovered the syndrome in 1966 in highly\nconsanguineous Jewish families from Yemen. In 2013, a genetic study pointed\nout that this mutation probably originates from Spanish and Portuguese\nSephardic Jews who fled the Inquisition in the 15th century and founded small\ncommunities in Ecuador, Chile, and Brazil. There are 17 different mutations\nthat cause Laron Syndrome, and one of them reached America, explains the\nscientist, professor emeritus at Tel Aviv University. In recent years, he has\npublished several studies focused on how to replicate the cancer-protective\neffects he sees in these patients. The scientist believes that the results\nseen in Ecuador cannot be generalized. \u201cIn our cohort of 76 individuals, who\nwere followed for many years, we have seen that the majority of older and\nobese patients develop insulin resistance and three men and eight women\nsuffered from diabetes,\u201d but only one of them has the same mutation as the\nEcuadorians, he said. His next scientific goal is to calculate how many people\nactually suffer from this condition around the world. \u201cThere are probably more\nthan 500, but in many countries they are never diagnosed,\u201d he notes in a\ntelephone conversation from Tel Aviv.\n\nLaron Syndrome is recessive, which means that you have to inherit two mutated\ncopies of the gene, one from the father and one from the mother, to suffer\nfrom it. It is possible for one person with the syndrome to have healthy\nchildren, and it is also possible for two people without the syndrome to carry\nthe mutation and have children with Laron. \u201cIt\u2019s a genetic lottery\u201d that is\namplified due to inbreeding, admits Guevara-Aguirre.\n\nThis doctor has shown that dwarfism can be treated by administering\nrecombinant IGF-1 protein from an early age. Furthermore, since 1992, he has\ntried to establish a \u201cmassive\u201d genetic diagnosis system that would allow these\ninhabitants to know if their partners are carriers of the mutation, but this\nhas not yet been done. \u201cIt is an easy and cheap intervention, but it has not\nmaterialized due to the ignorance of the authorities,\u201d he says.\n\nGuevara-Aguirre's goal now is to determine whether carriers of the mutation\nlive longer than their siblings and other relatives. \u201cMy feeling is yes, but\nit has to be proven. The problem is that this area is controlled by the narco-\nguerrilla,\u201d he laments.\n\nAlejandro Mart\u00edn-Montalvo, a researcher at Spain\u2019s National Research Council,\ncollaborated with Longo and Guevara-Aguirre on their study on Laron and cancer\nin 2011. He considers that \u201cthis new work is an advance, as it shows that\nthese people are not predisposed to cardiac failures as was believed until\nnow. In addition, it opens up a possible new line of research on how to\ntransfer these benefits to the general population.\u201d\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage\nfrom EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition\n\n### More information\n\n### A genetic patch corrects a rare syndrome in human brain organoid grafted\ninto a rat\n\nManuel Ansede | Madrid\n\n### Sarah Blagden, oncologist: \u2018We should eventually have a vaccine that you\nget at age 40 that protects you from cancer\u2019\n\nManuel Ansede | Madrid\n\n### Archived In\n\n  * Ecuador\n  * C\u00e1ncer\n\nAdheres to\n\nMore information\n\nIf you are interested in licensing this content, please contact\nventacontenidos@prisamedia.com\n\nSponsored Content\n\nTreppenlift-Vergleich\n\nRentner in Riesa: So kosten Treppenlifte fast nichtsTreppenlift-Vergleich|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nForge Of Empires\n\nWenn du \u00fcber 45 Jahre alt bist, wirst du dieses Strategiespiel 2024\nliebenForge Of Empires|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nCheckfox\n\nDiese Solardach-F\u00f6rdergelder sind vielen Hausbesitzen v\u00f6llig neu.Checkfox|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nAnd Also...\n\nA portrait of rich privilege in Brazil: A Porsche and a deadly attack after a\npoker gameEl Pa\u00eds\n\nAS\n\nShaq\u2019s prediction if the Lakers are eliminated in the PlayoffsAS\n\nAS\n\nIranian soccer player suspended and fined for hugging a womanAS\n\n_\n\n### newsletter\n\nSign up to EL PA\u00cdS in English Edition bulletin\n\nAp\u00fantate\n\n### Most viewed\n\n  1.
