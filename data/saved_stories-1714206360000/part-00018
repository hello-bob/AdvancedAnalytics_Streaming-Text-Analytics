It is.\n\nSamantha Laine Perfas\n\nHarvard Staff Writer\n\nJune 26, 2023 6 min read\n\n## Rheumatologist, epidemiologist discusses growth, spread of deer ticks,\nwhich transmit malady, and offers tips for how to avoid parasites\n\nThe odds of contracting Lyme disease from tick bites during warmer weather\nmonths continue to rise. That\u2019s owing to a series of factors, including\nchanges in climate conducive to maintenance of tick populations over a longer\nperiod of time and the expansion of range for the parasites south and west\nfrom historically high-risk areas in the Northeast and Upper Midwest,\naccording to the Companion Animal Parasite Council. To give readers a\nrefresher in ways to avoid contracting Lyme disease the Gazette spoke with\nNancy Shadick, a rheumatologist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and a clinical\nepidemiologist who has researched the malady since the 1990s. This\nconversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn the last five to 10 years, have you seen Lyme disease rates increasing?\n\nLyme disease is still the most common vector-borne illness. It continues to\nspread in endemic areas such as the upper Midwest and the Northeast, but it\nhas also spread down into the mid-Atlantic region and upward into the upper\nNortheast. With climate change and warmer temperatures, one example is that\nLyme disease is now spreading up into Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.\n\nIs climate change the main reason we\u2019re seeing an increase?\n\nThere is also increased general awareness and reporting. The CDC is now\nreporting both confirmed and probable Lyme disease cases, for example.\n\nThere are certain geographic areas of the country that are considered high-\nrisk. What are other factors that might cause an area to be high-risk?\n\nAreas that are wooded or have dense foliage \u2014 suburban or rural \u2014 tend to have\nmore Lyme disease cases. Ticks live in wooded areas and brush. So you won\u2019t\nget it in an urban area, for example, where there\u2019s little greenery. Golf\ncourses can be risky. When golfers hit a golf ball into the brush, they leave\nthe highly manicured golf course and go into the brush, which could be an area\nwhere there are a lot of ticks. The presence of whitetail deer is another\nindicator that there might be Lyme disease, or small mammals such as white-\nfooted mice, which can be carriers.\n\nAnd are all ticks bad? Or is it specifically deer ticks?\n\nLyme disease is transmitted by the deer tick, also known as the blacklegged\ntick. Other ticks, such as dog ticks, can transmit other illnesses, but not\nLyme disease.\n\n> \u201cIf not caught early, Lyme disease can progress to facial paralysis,\n> arthritis, meningitis, or inflammation of the heart called carditis that can\n> cause rhythm abnormalities.\u201d\n\nGAZETTE: Who is at most risk of infection?\n\nIn general there is a bimodal age distribution of Lyme disease with children\naged 5 to 9 most highly affected. Additionally, there has been an increasing\nmale predominance of the illness. The incidence rate ratios of males over\nfemales in most age groups were 39 to 89 percent higher for the time period of\n1992 to 2016.\n\nAnd what about pets? Are they at risk of carrying Lyme disease, or getting it\nthemselves?\n\nYes, pets can bring ticks into the house. For example, if your dog is out\nrunning in the woods, comes inside and sits on the furniture or sleeps in the\nbed with you, it does increase your likelihood of getting a tick bite. And a\ndog can contract Lyme disease, although they have certain protections that we\ndon\u2019t have yet, like vaccination. Dogs can be vaccinated, and many dogs take a\ntick and flea treatment that prevents them from getting tick bites.\n\nIf I\u2019m someone who is outdoors a lot in the summer, what are things that I can\ndo to protect myself?\n\nBe aware of your environment. When you hike, stay on the trail. You should\ntick-proof your clothing by wearing a repellent containing DEET. There are\nother repellents that contain more natural repellents \u2014 like lemon oil or\neucalyptus \u2014 but those are not as effective at repelling ticks. If you can,\nwear light-colored clothing, so you can identify the tick more easily. Wear\nlong pants and tuck them into your socks. And then the most important thing\nthat you should do is every time you\u2019re out in potential tick-laden areas, you\nshould do a tick check. In general it takes 36 hours for a tick to infect you,\nso if you check for ticks that evening, you can feel pretty confident that you\nhaven\u2019t been bitten. Ticks like humid, warm areas to bite, so check all parts\nof your body, especially folds in your skin like your elbows, behind your\nknees, or on your neck.\n\nTo properly remove a tick, grasp the tick close to the skin with fine-tipped\ntweezers and then pull straight up and out.\n\n#### How to safely remove a tick\n\nWhat are symptoms of Lyme disease?\n\nEarly symptoms include the classic erythema migrans rash, which is a red,\nring-like rash that spreads. This can develop within days or weeks, and\nsometimes a rash won\u2019t occur at all. You can also experience a flu-like\nillness with a fever, headache, and achy joints. If not caught early, Lyme\ndisease can progress to facial paralysis, arthritis, meningitis, or\ninflammation of the heart called carditis that can cause rhythm abnormalities.\nIf you suspect Lyme disease, it\u2019s important to seek treatment. The best way to\nrecover quickly is to take antibiotics as soon as you can.\n\nIn terms of research, are we making progress either in prevention or treatment\nof Lyme disease-related ailments?\n\nA Lyme disease vaccine from Pfizer and Valneva is in a Phase 3 trial right\nnow. We\u2019re hopeful that the vaccine will be ready in 2025. The UMass Chan\nMedical School is also studying another potential therapy to prevent Lyme\ndisease that is in clinical trials. This prevention is not a vaccine but a\nmonoclonal antibody that kills the Lyme bacteria in the tick\u2019s gut.\n\nPractically speaking, are there any resources or sites that you would\nrecommend for people to learn more about Lyme disease and the risk it poses in\ntheir area?\n\nThere is a Harvard Health Lyme Wellness website that offers a lot of\neducational information. The CDC also has an excellent website for the general\npublic and has a tick-borne illness reference manual for clinicians. Each\nstate department of health typically has tick borne illness information and\nmonthly reports on the illness.\n\n#### Share this article\n\n  * Share on Facebook\n  * Share on LinkedIn\n  * Email article\n  * Print/PDF\n\n## You might like\n\n  * Health\n\n### How old is too old to run?\n\nNo such thing, specialist says \u2014 but when your body is trying to tell you\nsomething, listen\n\nPart of the Wondering series\n\n3 min read\n\n  * Health\n\n### America\u2019s graying.
