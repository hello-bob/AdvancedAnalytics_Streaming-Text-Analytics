Inspired by Teaching the Codex, an online pedagogical\ntool built by master's students of Oxford University\u2019s Merton College, this\nproject highlights features (like pricking and ruling, for example) that are\nvaluable for educators and researchers.\n\nThese curated CURIOSity pages provide context for the tagged features using\nrelevant collection items. The tags have been clustered into four categories:\nBinding, Pages, Content, and Decoration. See the table of contents below for\nan overview of the topics discussed and the tags included in each section.\n\nSome tips for navigating the tagged manuscripts: while each tagged manuscript\nwill contain the feature, some features may be challenging to spot in the\ndigitizations. To ensure you aren\u2019t missing any of the available images of\npartially digitized manuscripts, be sure to check out the HOLLIS record.\nCertain features (like gauffered edges and exposed cords) can be excluded or\ndifficult to see in some digitizations. If you would like to see a feature\nmore clearly, you can try requesting a scan or, if you are able to visit the\nlibrary in person, consulting materials in the reading room.\n\n##\n\ntable of contents\n\n### Binding\n\nThe Binding section introduces the history of medieval bookbinding practices.\nAfter reading, you should have a grasp on basic bookbinding terminology, the\nmaterials used to bind books, and the basic construction of medieval books.\n\nCatchwords\n\n58 items\n\nChained Bindings\n\n2 items\n\nSammelb\u00e4nde\n\n2 items\n\nClasps\n\n5 items\n\nStraps\n\n23 items\n\nTies\n\n4 items\n\nThongs\n\n8 items\n\nCords\n\n8 items\n\nTapes\n\n1 item\n\nWooden Boards\n\n16 items\n\nPasteboard\n\n1 item\n\nReused Parchment\n\n35 items\n\n### Pages\n\nThe Pages section covers the making and preparation of a medieval manuscript\u2019s\npages.
