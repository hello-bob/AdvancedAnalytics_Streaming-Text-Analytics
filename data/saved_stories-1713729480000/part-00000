Chris Rufo, a conservative pundit, has identified plagiarism in\nClaudine Gay and Christina Cross\u2019s work. In a bit of tit-for-tat, Neri Oxman\nwas then profiled for similar sins (as her husband was one of the most vocal\ncritics of Gay).\n\nMuch of the discussion around this seems to be more focused on who is doing\nthe complaining than the actual content of the complaints. It can\nsimultaneously be true that Chris Rufo has ulterior motives to malign those\nparticular scholars (ditto for those criticizing Neri Oxman), but the\ncomplaints are themselves legitimate.\n\nWhat is plagiarism? I would typically quote a specific definition here, but I\nactually do not like the version in the Merriam Webster (or American Heritage)\ndictionary. I assert plagiarism is the direct copying of material without\nproper attribution to its original source. The concept of \u201cidea\u201d plagiarism\nseems to muddy up the waters \u2013 I am ignoring that here. That is, even if you\ndon\u2019t \u201cidea\u201d plagiarize, you can do \u201cdirect copying of material without proper\nattribution\u201d.\n\nIt may seem weird that you can do one without the other, but many of the\nexamples given (whether by Rufo or those who pointed out Neri Oxman\u2019s) are\ninsepid passages that are mostly immaterial to the main thesis of the paper,\nor they have some form of attribution but it is not proper. So it goes, the\nway academics write you can cut out whole cloth large portions of writing and\nit won\u2019t make a difference to the story line.\n\nThese passages however are clearly direct copying of material without proper\nattribution. I think Cross\u2019s is a great example, here is one (of several Rufo\npoints out):\n\nWords are so varied, if I gave you a table of descriptions, something like:\n\n    \n    \n    survey years: 1998, 2000, ...., 2012 missing data: took prior years survey values\n\nAnd asked 100 scholars to put that in a plain text description in a paragraph,\nall 100 would have some overlap in wording, but not near this extent. For\nnumbers, these paragraphs have around 30 words, say your word vocabulary\nrelevant to describe that passage is 100 words, the overlap would be under 10%\nof the material. Here is a simple simulation to illustrate.\n\nAnd this does not consider the word order (and the fact that the corpus is\nmuch larger than 100 words). Which will both make the probability of this\nsevere of overlap much smaller.\n\nUnlike what ASA says, it does not matter that what was copied is a\nstraightforward description of a dataset, it clearly still is plagiarism in\nterms of \u201cdirect copying without proper attribution\u201d. The Neri Oxman examples\nare similar, they are direct copying, even if they have an in text citation at\nthe end, that is not proper attribution. If these cases went in front of\nethics boards at universities that students are subject to, they would all be\nfound guilty of plagiarism. The content of what was copied and its importance\nto the work does not matter at all.\n\nSo the defense of the clearly indefensible based on ideological grounds among\nacademics I find quite disappointing. But, as a criminologist I am curious as\nto its prevalence \u2013 if you took a sample of dissertations or peer reviewed\narticles, how many would have plagiarized passages? Would it be 1%, or 10%, or\n50%, I genuinely do not know (it clearly won\u2019t be 0% though!).\n\nI would do this to my own articles if I could easily (I don\u2019t think I did, but\nit is possible I self-plagiarized portions of my dissertation in later peer\nreviewed articles). So let me know if you have Turnitin (or are aware of\nanother service), that can upload PDFs to check this.\n\nI\u2019d note here that some of the defense of these scholars is the \u201cidea\u201d part of\nplagiarism, which is a shifting sands definition of saying it is necessary to\nsteal some fundamental idea for it to be plagiarism. Idea plagiarism isn\u2019t\nreally a thing, at least not a thing anymore than vague norms among academics\n(or even journalists). Scooping ideas is poor form, but that is it.\n\nI am not aware of my words being plagiarized, I am aware of several examples\nof scholars clearly taking work from my code repositories or blog posts and\nnot citing them. (As a note to scholars, it is fine to cite my blog posts, I\nmaybe have a dozen or so citations to my blog at this point.) But those would\nnot typically be considered plagiarism. If someone copies one of my functions\nand applies it to their own data, it is not plagiarism as typically\nunderstood. If I noted that and sent those examples to COPE and asked for the\narticles to be retracted, I am pretty sure COPE would say that is not\nplagiarism as typically treated.\n\nHonestly it does not matter though. I find it obnoxious to not be cited, but\nit is a minor thing, and clearly does not impact the quality of the work. I\nbasically expect my work on the blog to be MIT licensed (subject to change) \u2013\nit is mostly a waste of time for me to police how it is used. Should Cross be\ndisciplined for her plagiarism? Probably not \u2013 if it was an article I would\nsuggest a correction would be sufficient.\n\nI can understand students may be upset that they are held to higher standards\nthan their professors, but I am not sure if that means students should be\ngiven more slack or if professors should be given less. These instances of\nplagiarism by Gay/Cross/Oxman I take more as laziness than anything, but they\ndo not have much to do with whether they are fit for their jobs.\n\n## AI writing\n\nPretty soon, even my plagiarism definition is not going to work anymore, as\ngenerative chatbots are essentially stochastic parrots \u2013 everything they do is\nparaphrasing plagiarism, but in a form that is hard to see direct copying\n(that tools like Turnitin will identify). So I am starting to get links to the\nblog from Perplexity and Iask. So people may cite ChatGPT or whatever service\ngenerated the text, but that service copied from someone else, and no one is\nthe wiser.\n\nThese specific services have paraphrasing citations, e.g. you ask a question,\nit gives the response + 3 citations (these are called RAG applications in LLM\nspeak). So you may think they are OK in terms of above, they give paraphrasing\ntype at the end of paragraph citations. But I have noticed they frequently\nspit out near verbatim copies of my work for a few blog posts I get traffic\nfor. The example I have linked to was this post on fitting a beta-binomial\nmodel in python. So I intentionally wrote that post because the first google\nresults were bad/wrong and ditto for the top stackoverflow questions. So I am\nactually happy my blog got picked up by google quite fast and made it to the\ntop of the list.\n\nThese services are stochastic, so subject to change, but iask is currently a\ndirect copy of my work and does not give me as a list of its citations\n(although I come up high in their search rankings, so not clear to me why I am\nnot credited). Even if it did though it would be the same problem as Oxman, it\nwould not be a proper quoted citation.\n\nAnd the Cross faux pas edit a few words will not only be common but regular\nwith these tools.\n\nThis is pretty much intended though from my perspective with these tools \u2013 I\nsaw a wrong on the internet and wrote a post to make it so others do not make\nthe same mistakes. Does it matter if the machine does not properly attribute\nme? I just want you to do your stats right, I don\u2019t get a commission if you\nproperly cite me. (I rather you just personally hire me to help than get a\ncitation!)\n\nI think these services may make citation policing over plagiarism impossible\nthough. No major insights here to prevent it \u2013 I say now it is mostly\nimmaterial to the quality of the work, but I do think saying you can carte\nblanche plagiarize is probably not good.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Pinterest\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nSome GIS data scraping adventures: Banksy graffiti and gang locations in\nNYCMarch 17, 2016In \"Mapping\"\n\nWhy I publish preprintsMay 30, 2019In \"Papers\"\n\nLit reviews are (almost) functionally worthlessDecember 16, 2020In \"Criminal\nJustice\"\n\nLeave a comment\n\nby apwheele on April 20, 2024 \u2022 Permalink\n\nPosted in scholarly, writing\n\nTagged plagiarism\n\nPosted by apwheele on April 20, 2024\n\nhttps://andrewpwheeler.com/2024/04/20/some-musings-on-plagiarism/\n\nPrevious Post Grabbing the NHAMCS emergency room data in python\n\nLeave a comment\n\n### Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\n  * ## Recent Posts\n\n    * Some musings on plagiarism\n    * Grabbing the NHAMCS emergency room data in python\n    * Matching mentors to mentees using OR-tools\n    * Poisson designs and Minimum Detectable Effects\n    * Harmweighted hotspots, using ESRI python API, and Crime De-Coder Updates\n  * ## Categories\n\n  * ## Site RSS Feeds\n\n    * RSS - Posts\n    * RSS - Comments\n  * Join 372 other subscribers\n\n  * aoristic cartography census choropleth citeulike color cost-benefit courses crime-mapping crime-trends Crime Analysis Criminal Justice data-manipulation data visualization deep-learning excel flow-data geocoding ggplot2 github google-streetview-api grammar of graphics group-based-trajectory gun-violence healthcare homicide-rates hot spots hypothesis-testing kernel-density linear programming logistic-regression machine-learning MACRO mapping matplotlib meta multi-level negative-binomial network NetworkX officer-involved-shooting open-science paper Papers peer-review Poisson prediction Predictive-Policing presentation Python Python-programability pytorch quasi-experiment r recidivism regression resources scatterplot scholarly seaborn shootings simulation slopegraph small-multiples social-networking SPSS stackexchange Stata statistics survey time-series uncertainty wdd web-scraping writing\n\n  * ## Top Posts & Pages\n\n    * Some musings on plagiarism\n    * Poisson designs and Minimum Detectable Effects\n    * Group based trajectory models in Stata - some graphs and fit statistics\n  * ## Stack Exchange\n\nBlog at WordPress.com.\n\n  * Comment\n  * Reblog\n  * Subscribe Subscribed\n\n    * Andrew Wheeler\n    * Already have a WordPress.com account?
