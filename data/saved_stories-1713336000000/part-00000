In less than 60 seconds, she counted eight\ntrucks.\n\nThat was just the beginning. In less than one hour, about 430 trucks passed\nthrough the intersection she was monitoring in Archer Heights, a mostly Latino\ncommunity on the Southwest Side of the city. She was joined by Jos\u00e9 Miguel\nAcosta C\u00f3rdova, who works for a community group known as the Little Village\nEnvironmental Justice Organization.\n\nGrist thanks its sponsors.

Here's How\n\nThe two organizations recently put out a report measuring the extent of the\ncity\u2019s truck traffic, counting trucks moving through one nearby suburb and 17\nChicago neighborhoods. Using sensors installed in 35 spots, they tracked the\nnumber of medium- and heavy-duty trucks that went past in a span of more than\n24 hours. Over the course of a day, more than 5,100 trucks and buses were\nrecorded in Archer Heights \u2014 the most of any neighborhood.\n\nThat data points to key questions that Chicago and Illinois need to answer,\nsaid Acosta C\u00f3rdova.\n\n\u201cWhen are there too many warehouses and when are there too many trucks?\u201d he\nasked.\n\nThat\u2019s a question that goes beyond Chicago, which happens to be the largest\nfreight hub in North America. Black and brown communities living near the\nindustrial corridors of many urban areas are disproportionately paying for it\nwith their health.\n\nGrist thanks its sponsors.

Here's How\n\nVaca and Acota C\u00f3rdova are not alone in their research on local traffic.\nAcross the country, local groups are increasingly finding ways to quantify the\nextent of localized air pollution, transforming real-time data into useful\ninformation that neighbors can use to inform day-to-day decisions, like\nwhether or not to stay inside.\n\nJos\u00e9 Miguel Acosta C\u00f3rdova, left, and Paulina Vaca stand by one of the busiest\nintersections in Chicago, in a neighborhood on the Southwest Side. Grist /\nWBEZ /Juanpablo Ramirez-Franco\n\nWhile state and federal agencies do actively monitor air quality, their\nnetworks are limited, according to a United States Government Accountability\nOffice report published last month. The national ambient air quality\nmonitoring system is not designed to pinpoint pollution hotspots. More and\nmore, localized data is exactly what frontline communities are calling for in\norder to protect and advocate for themselves.\n\n\u201cThey want to know better than what their pollution level probably is,\u201d said\nJames Bradbury, the director of research and policy analysis at the Georgetown\nClimate Center, a nonpartisan research institution that studies federal and\nstate climate policies.\n\n\u201cThey would like to have more granular and specific information that informs\nwhat\u2019s happening in their communities,\u201d Bradbury said.\n\nCommunity air quality monitoring programs are taking off across the country,\nhe added.\n\nFrom Newark, New Jersey, to the Bay Area, local organizations are counting\ntrucks and installing small networks of air quality sensors to fill the gap\nleft open by state monitoring systems. As of 2022, the federal government had\nfunded over 130 community air monitoring projects nationwide to the tune of\n$53.4 million.\n\nFreight continues to be a major economic juggernaut in the Chicago region, and\nit comes at a significant health cost. The Respiratory Health Association\nranked Illinois fifth out of all states for the highest number of deaths from\ndiesel engine pollution per capita in 2023.\n\nDiesel is what, in large part, moves freight around, according Brian\nUrbaszewski, director of environmental health programs for the Respiratory\nHealth Organization.\n\n\u201cWhat comes out of the tailpipe of those engines is a collection of air\npollutants: everything from nitrogen oxides to fine particulate matter, and\neven carbon dioxide,\u201d Urbaszewski said. Exposure to these pollutants are\nassociated with a host of medical issues, ranging from respiratory to\ncardiovascular health impacts.\n\nAcosta C\u00f3rdova said Illinois needs to adopt tighter truck regulations that are\nalready in use in California and several other states. These policies would\nraise emission standards for tailpipe pollution and set a path for zero-\nemission trucks.\n\nVaca said that this new trucking data she and her colleagues compiled won\u2019t\nsurprise longtime residents of the city\u2019s industrial corridors. But it is hard\nevidence that she hopes will help convince elected leaders that air pollution\nis an issue of life or death.\n\nRead Next\n\nThe EPA\u2019s push to clean up trucking goes way beyond 18-wheelers\n\nJake Bittle\n\n\u201cHaving these numbers, it\u2019s really crucial to then advocate for more electric\nvehicles,\u201d Vaca said. \u201cTo use this to advocate against permitting more\nindustry in areas where it\u2019s already overburdened.\u201d\n\nMore than 1,000 lives and over $10 billion could be saved annually if the\nChicago region electrified approximately 30 percent of all light and heavy-\nduty vehicles, according to a study published last fall by researchers at\nNorthwestern University.\n\n\u201cWe found that the majority of the health benefits from those reductions in\npollution occur in environmental justice communities or communities of color,\nor disadvantaged communities in Chicago,\u201d said Daniel E. Horton, a professor\nof earth and planetary sciences at Northwestern.\n\nEarlier this month, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced\nfinalized federal emissions standards for heavy vehicles that would require\nmanufacturers to limit pollution from heavy trucks beginning in 2030. It\u2019s\nestimated the new policy will prevent a billion tons of greenhouse gas\nemissions from entering the atmosphere. But Acosta C\u00f3rdova said the guidelines\ndo not go far enough to address the climate crisis. In Illinois, it\u2019ll be\nyears before residents see relief from freight driven air pollution.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing we want to see out of this is more data collection,\u201d Acosta\nC\u00f3rdova said. \u201cBut, also eventually, [we want] a full transition to zero\nemission trucks.\u201d\n\nA message from\n\n#### All donations DOUBLED!\n\nGrist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable\nsolutions to climate change.
