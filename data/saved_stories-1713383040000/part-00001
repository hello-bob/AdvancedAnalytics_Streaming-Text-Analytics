We could do simple algebra like:\n\n\u22123ba2\u22123ba\u22123aac\u22121=4bca=4bc=4c=\u221234\n\nIt's strange to see vectors manipulated this way, isn't it? The cancellations\ngenerally make sense, but what does a quantity like \u22123ba2 even mean?\n\nThis type of algebra looks weird because we learned in school how to add and\nsubtract vectors, but we never learned how to multiply and divide them!\n\nMost curriculums cover the dot product and the cross product but neither of\nthese is invertible so neither gives us vector inversion.\n\n> But invertible vector multiplication does exist and we can derive it\n> ourselves.\n\nIn this post we will re-invent a form of math that is far superior to the one\nyou learned in school. The ideas herein are nothing short of revolutionary.\n\n# Table of Contents\n\n  * The Units of Magnitude\n\n    * Scalars\n    * Vectors\n    * Bivectors\n    * Trivectors\n    * Recap and Higher Dimensional Concerns\n  * Addition of Like Types\n  * Addition of Disparate Types\n  * Choosing The Vector Product\n  * Examining the Vector Product\n  * A Quick Warmup (Start here if you just need a refresher)\n  * Vectors as Transformations\n  * Transforming Twice\n  * A New Foundation for Physics\n  * Conclusion\n  * Geometric Algebra Cheat Sheet\n  * Contact me\n  * Errata\n\n# The Units of Magnitude\n\nWe're going to look at the things we're already familiar with and try to draw\na pattern. We'll use this pattern to create some new objects. Those objects\nwill lead us to invertible vector multiplication.\n\nAlong the way we'll pretend that we're inventing this all for ourselves. We'll\nmake a few wrong turns and see why they're wrong, rather than just dropping\nconclusions out of the sky.\n\nWe're going to derive the foundations of an entire branch of Mathematics that\nis usually only taught to grad students. But to get there you need nothing\nmore than high-school algebra skills.\n\nThe key insight comes from examining scalars and vectors. We'll look at their\nmagnitudes and focus on the units that those magnitudes are measured in.\n\n## Scalars\n\nA scalar s is a regular number like 1.618 or \u22123 or 1371.\n\nA scalar is a point on a number line. Its magnitude \u2225s\u2225 is just its absolute\nvalue. We can call this a 0-Vector or refer to it as \"Grade 0\" to indicate\nthat its magnitude carries no units.\n\n## Vectors\n\nFor the purposes of this post a vector a is an arrow in 3D space. It points\nfrom the origin to some other point in space and is usually written like this:\n\na=\u23a3\u23a2\u23a1a1a2a3\u23a6\u23a5\u23a4\n\nOr equivalently, like this:\n\na=a1x^+a2y^+a3z^\n\nx^\n\ny^\n\nz^\n\na\n\na3\n\na1\n\na2\n\nBy the way, all these 3D illustrations are fully interactive. Go ahead and\nrotate them around to make sure you get a good intuitive feel for them.\n\nA vector's magnitude \u2225a\u2225 is equal to its length, so we'll call them 1-Vectors\nor say they are \"Grade 1\" because length is a 1-dimensional quantity.\n\nThat length is just:\n\n\u2225a\u2225=a12+a22+a32\n\n## Bivectors\n\nThis suggests a pattern. If a scalar's magnitude is a 0-dimensional value that\ncarries no units, and a vector's magnitude is a 1-dimensional value that\ncarries units of length, can we invent a type of object whose magnitude is a\n2-dimensional value that carries units of area?\n\nLet's try!\n\nIf vectors are oriented chunks of length, then our new object is some sort of\noriented chunk of area, some segment of a 2D plane that is floating in 3D\nspace.\n\nThe most efficient way to define a plane is to use the normal vector n which\nis perpendicular to the plane. The direction of the normal vector tells us the\norientation of the plane, and we can encode magnitude as the length of that\nnormal vector.\n\nx^\n\ny^\n\nz^\n\nn\n\nBut...wait that definition isn't consistent with our goal. This object does\ndescribe an oriented plane and it does have a degree of freedom to represent\nscale, but it's still just a vector so its magnitude will be a length, not an\narea. This won't work.\n\nWhat else can we try?\n\nOne alternative way to describe a plane is to use two vectors, a and b. This\nrequires specifying 6 values rather than just 3, so it is less efficient but\nwho cares, we're inventing our own math here so we make the rules.\n\nThe plane that they both fall upon gives us an orientation. But how do we get\nan area?\n\nWe've already got two vectors so the simplest possible solution might be to\ncomplete the triangle:\n\nx^\n\ny^\n\nz^\n\na\n\nb\n\nWhich has an area equal to:\n\nAtriangle=21\u2225a\u2225\u2225b\u2225sin(\u03b8)\n\nWhere \u03b8 is the angle between the vectors.\n\nThis works but we'll have to carry around an inconvenient factor of 21.\n\nOn a lark, what if we borrow an idea from CAD software and try to extrude a in\nthe direction of b?\n\nx^\n\ny^\n\nz^\n\na\n\nb\n\nThe resulting shape is a parallelogram which covers an area:\n\nAparallelogram=\u2225a\u2225\u2225b\u2225sin(\u03b8)\n\nBy choosing to extrude, we get to drop the extra factor of 21, and we get a\nvery hands-on, intuitive definition for what we're doing with our two vectors.\n\nIn fact, let's come up with a special new symbol that means extrude. We'll use\n\u2227 and pronounce it \"extrude\". We can write down our parallelogram as a\u2227b.\n\n> The parallelogram a\u2227b is defined by extruding the vector a in the direction\n> of b\n\nSo we've got our new object, a 2D parallelogram floating in 3D space. It takes\ntwo vectors to describe these things so let's call this object a bivector.\n\n> The bivector a\u2227b is defined by extruding the vector a in the direction of b\n\nIf we double the length of one of the input vectors, the output bivector stays\nin the same plane, it just doubles in area:\n\nx^\n\ny^\n\nz^\n\n2a\n\nb\n\n2a\u2227b\n\nx^\n\ny^\n\nz^\n\na\n\n2b\n\na\u22272b\n\nAlready we have a tough choice to make. Consider the bivectors 2a\u2227b and a\u22272b.\nThese two objects are obviously not identical. But they share the same plane\nand they have the same magnitude. Should we say that they are equal or not\nequal?\n\nWhen you're inventing your own algebra, you get to choose!\n\nIf we say they are equal we'll get an algebra that allows us to freely move\ncoefficients around, which is a property we're used to from scalar algebra. So\nsure, let's define this as an axiom:\n\n2a\u2227b=a\u22272b\n\nBecause their orientations and magnitudes are both equal.\n\nMore generally, using any scalar s:\n\ns(a\u2227b)=sa\u2227b=a\u2227sb(1.0)\n\nThis property is called linearity which just means that the output scales\nlinearly with the inputs. This is desirable property when designing an\nalgebra! If the extrude product is linear, we can freely move coefficients\naround however we like.\n\nBut it comes at a cost. 2a\u2227b and a\u22272b are visually distinct objects yet we say\nthey are equal.\n\nThe fact that we can write (and visualize) the same bivector multiple ways\nimplies that our notation is redundant. Even though we write down bivectors\nusing 6 numbers, it turns out there are only 3 degrees of freedom in a\nbivector.\n\nEven though we visualize them as oriented parallelograms, the only important\nproperties of a bivector are the plane it lives in and the area of its\nparallelogram. The actual shape of the parallelogram and its location in that\nplane aren't important.\n\nIf you've heard of quaternions, they famously use 4 numbers to represent 3\ndegrees of rotation. Their redundancy makes them much more algebraicly useful\nbut also harder to visualize and understand.\n\nBivectors might be similar. We'll come back to this.\n\nBut let's keep inspecting them first! What happens if we switch the input\nordering? Does a\u2227b equal b\u2227a?\n\na\n\nb\n\na\u2227b\n\na\n\nb\n\nb\u2227a\n\nWell, a\u2227b forms a parallelogram by extruding an orange vector out sideways, so\nit forms an orange parallelogram. But b\u2227a extrudes a purple vector up almost\nvertically, so it extrudes a purple parallelogram. Again we get to choose if\nthese should be considered equal.\n\nYou may complain that vectors don't usually carry any intrinsic color, so how\ncan we reliably use color as the basis of distinguishing bivectors?\n\nYour complaint is valid, and plus we don't always get to use color when we're\nsketching in a notebook so let's try looking at this situation in a way that\ndoesn't rely so heavily on color:\n\na\n\nb\n\na\u2227b=\u21bb\n\na\n\nb\n\nb\u2227a=\u21ba\n\nBy putting the second vector at the tip of the first, we can see that a\u2227b\nforms a parallelogram by tracing the perimeter clockwise, but b\u2227a forms a\nparallelogram by tracing the perimeter anticlockwise.\n\nNow, the perceived spin direction changes based on which side of the\nparallelogram you're looking at. If you move the camera around you can make\neither bivector look clockwise or anticlockwise so I'm not trying to make any\nclaims about their absolute spin directions.\n\nBut the fact remains that from any fixed camera position, the two bivectors\nspin in opposite directions. This is just another way of looking at the color\ndifference, without us having to use colored pencils every time we draw\nbivectors on paper.\n\nSo we have to choose: Do we want our algebra to encapsulate a concept of spin\ndirection, or do we want to go without?\n\nThere is probably a useful algebra to be found down either of these roads. But\nto me, spin direction feels pretty important so let's define our second axiom:\n\na\u2227b=\u2212b\u2227a(1.1)\n\nThis equation makes it look like one quantity is positive and the other is\nnegative, but we're not necessarily picking which is which. We're just saying\nthat whatever the two spin directions are, they're opposites.\n\nIn deriving bivectors we invented the extrude product. Let's explore it a\nlittle more!\n\nWhat happens if you extrude a vector by itself?\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\u2227b\n\nWell, any vector b is always parallel to itself, so the extruded parallelogram\nwill always have zero area. We can already write an identity!\n\nb\u2227b=0(1.2)\n\nWhat happens if we form a bivector from two orthogonal unit vectors like x^\nand y^?\n\nx^\n\ny^\n\nz^\n\nx^\u2227y^\n\nThe parallelogram they form happens to be a square with unit area! We can use\nthis to form three distinct unit bivectors:\n\nx^\n\ny^\n\nz^\n\nx^\u2227y^\n\ny^\u2227z^\n\nz^\u2227x^\n\nThese three unit bivectors are orthogonal to each other, which just means that\nif you project one plane onto another, its shadow occupies zero area. They\nalso form a basis for all bivectors, which means that every conceivable\nbivector can be written as a weighted sum of these three.\n\nSaid again: Every plane is just some combination of these three planes.\n\nThe order you choose to write the vectors in doesn't really matter as long as\nyou pick one thing and stick to it, but we should pick something that is easy\nto remember. I think we should use x^\u2227z^ instead of z^\u2227x^ because that way,\nevery unit bivector is spelled alphabetically: (x^\u2227y^), (y^\u2227z^), and (x^\u2227z^).\nThis ruins our nice one-of-each-color pattern, but it means we have a handy\nmnemonic device to remember our basis bivectors.\n\nHowever you choose to write them, their mutual orthogonality gives bivectors\nan interesting commonality with regular vectors. Any vector can be written as\nthe weighted sum of basis vectors:\n\nv=v1x^+v2y^+v3z^\n\nWhere you find the coefficients v1, v2, v3 by projecting v onto the unit\nvectors x^, y^, z^.\n\nSimilarly, any bivector can be written as the weighted sum of basis bivectors:\n\nb\u21d2=b1(x^\u2227y^)+b2(y^\u2227z^)+b3(x^\u2227z^)\n\nWhere you find the coefficients b1, b2, b3 by projecting the bivector b\u21d2 onto\nthe unit bivectors (x^\u2227y^), (y^\u2227z^), (x^\u2227z^).\n\nBecause bivectors can be written as three coefficients, they behave very\nsimilarly to vectors. You can add two bivectors the same way you add two\nvectors. You can multiply a bivector by a scalar the same way you would with a\nvector. The similarities are so striking that we might think of them as\n\"pseudovectors\":\n\nb\u21d2=\u23a3\u23a2\u23a1b1b2b3\u23a6\u23a5\u23a4\n\nBut I won't write them this way because I think that obscures their true\nnature.\n\nInstead, I will use:\n\nb\u21d2=b1(x^\u2227y^)+b2(y^\u2227z^)+b3(x^\u2227z^)\n\nBecause it forces us to remember what those coefficients are attached to. A\nbivector contains three degrees of freedom just like a vector, but they are\nnot the same degrees of freedom.\n\nBy the way I drew two arrows on top of the b to indicate that it is a\nbivector, not a vector. We won't use this notation much but it's nice to have\nin case we need it.\n\nSo there we have it, a new type of object called a bivector which is an\noriented chunk of area! Its magnitude carries units of area, so bivectors are\nconsidered 2-Vectors, or referred to as \"Grade 2\".\n\n## Trivectors\n\nOkay we have a handle on scalars, vectors, and bivectors. Is there an object\nwhich behaves like an oriented volume? Something we might call a trivector?\n\nFor bivectors we made progress by extruding one vector in the direction given\nby a second vector, which yielded a 2D parallelogram. Can we extrude our\nparallelogram into a 3D volume?\n\nWhy not! Extruding a parallelogram into 3D yields a parallelepiped. Basically\na cube but all askew:\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nWhich we can write as t\u21db=a\u2227b\u2227c.\n\nThis object's magnitude is clearly its volume so we've got that taken care of.\nBut how should we think about orientation?\n\nWell, let's take a quick look at x\u2227y\u2227z\n\nx\u2227y\u2227z\n\nThis is clearly a unit cube which has a volume of 1.\n\nIf we throw a minus sign in front of any vector, let's pick y, we get a\ndifferent cube. Are these two trivectors equals or opposites?\n\nx\u2227\u2212y\u2227z\n\nYet another difficult choice! Another way to ask it is: does x\u2227\u2212y\u2227z have a\nvolume of 1 or \u22121? Can a box contain negative volume?\n\nI think so, if it is inside out! If you have a right-handed glove and you flip\nit inside out it becomes a left-handed glove.\n\nIf you have a right-handed volume and you flip it inside out it becomes a\nleft-handed volume.\n\nLeft-handed gloves are clearly not equal to right-handed gloves, so I think we\nshould consider them opposites:\n\nx\u2227y\u2227z=\u2212(x\u2227\u2212y\u2227z)\n\nBy convention, most people agree that right-handed volume is positive and\nleft-handed volume is negative, but this is an arbitrary choice. Really, the\nonly important thing is that they are opposites.\n\nWriting it out more formally:\n\n\u2212(x\u2227y\u2227z)=\u2212x\u2227y\u2227z=x\u2227\u2212y\u2227z=x\u2227y\u2227\u2212z\n\nWhich is really just another way of saying that we can freely move\ncoefficients around, even negative coefficients.\n\nRemembering equation 1.1, which lets us swap the order of any two vectors at\nthe cost of a minus sign:\n\n\u2212(x\u2227y\u2227z)=y\u2227x\u2227z=x\u2227z\u2227y=z\u2227y\u2227x(1.3)\n\nThis is great because it means that no matter what order the unit vectors\nappear in, no matter if they are positive or negative, we can always shuffle\nthem around and insert minus signs to get them back into the standard x\u2227y\u2227z\norder.\n\nThat means every trivector is just a scaled version of x\u2227y\u2227z:\n\nt\u21db=t1x\u2227y\u2227z\n\nWe might write a trivector using 9 numbers, but it only encapsulates a single\ndegree of freedom: its volume.\n\nSo I guess we're back at something that has just one degree of freedom and\nfeels more like a scalar. In fact you might even think of trivectors as\npseudoscalars because they behave so similarly.\n\nRemember that we only arrived at equation 1.1 because we decided that bivector\nspin direction was important\u2014that clockwise and anticlockwise are opposites.\n\nWe could have chosen to ignore bivector spin direction but if we'd have made\nthat decision then to be self-consistent we would now be forced to ignore\ntrivector handedness. Perhaps there is a useful algebraic system down that\nroad, but it models a universe where inside-out and rightside-in are not\ndistinguishable, which is not our universe.\n\nTrivectors are called 3-Vectors or thought of as \"Grade 3\" because their\nmagnitude carries units of volume.\n\nIn the same way that bivectors behave as pseudovectors, trivectors behave as\npseudoscalars.\n\n## Recap and Higher Dimensional Concerns\n\nGrade| Magnitude| Written| Bases  \n---|---|---|---  \nScalars| 0| -| s| 1  \nVectors| 1| length| a| 3  \nBivectors| 2| area| a\u2227b| 3  \nTrivectors| 3| volume| a\u2227b\u2227c| 1  \n  \nThe concept of Grade extends out to any number of dimensions, so we might ask\nwhat about quadvectors?\n\nWell, it is impossible to hold any 3D volume in a 2D universe, so it also\nseems impossible to hold any 4D volume in a 3D universe. I don't think there's\nany way to extend our pattern further without amending our definition of what\nspace is.\n\n# Addition of Like Types\n\nYou've made it a long way! We've derived some new fundamental objects and now\nit's time we learn how they interact with each other.\n\nWe all know how to add scalars together: Just add the values.\n\nVectors can be added together in a simple way: Project the input vectors onto\nthree orthogonal unit vectors then add up the components\n\na+b=(a1x^+a2y^+a3z^)+(b1x^+b2y^+b3z^)=(a1+b1)x^+(a2+b2)y^+(a3+b3)z^(2.0)\n\nBivectors behave a lot like vectors:\n\nc\u21d2+d\u21d2=c1x^\u2227y^+c2y^\u2227z^+c3x^\u2227z^+d1x^\u2227y^+d2y^\u2227z^+d3x^\u2227z^=(c1+d1)x^\u2227y^+(c2+d2)y^\u2227z^+(c3+d3)x^\u2227z^(2.1)\n\nWe could go ahead and develop explicit formulas for how to project a bivector\non another bivector but there's no need. We're just trying to develop an\nintuition right now.\n\nTrivectors are just fancy scalars. There's only one meaningful unit trivector\nso you just write your trivectors in terms of x^\u2227y^\u2227z^ and add the components\nyou end up with\n\nt\u21db+u\u21db=t1(x^\u2227y^\u2227z^)+u1(x^\u2227y^\u2227z^)=(t1+u1)(x^\u2227y^\u2227z^)(2.2)\n\nSo we've made it through the first hurdle\u2014our new algebra would not be very\nuseful it we couldn't add like types!\n\n# Addition of Disparate Types\n\nWhat does it mean to add a vector to a scalar?\n\na+bx^=?\n\nI don't think there is any meaningful way to perform this computation. All you\ncan do is just write out the sum as given.\n\nThis is reminsicent of the imaginary number i=\u22121. We just accept that value in\nthe direction of i is orthogonal to value in the direction of 1, so we write\nout complex numbers like:\n\na+bi\n\nAnd we don't try to actually add a and b in any other way. We just accept that\na on its own is a real number, bi on its own is an imaginary number, and a+bi\nis a new thing called a complex number.\n\nApplying this idea to our current situation, we can just say that objects with\ndifferent grades are orthogonal to each other and cannot be meaningfully\nadded.\n\nA quantity like\n\na+bx^+c(x^\u2227y^)+d(x^\u2227y^\u2227z^)\n\nIs perfectly valid, but it cannot be simplified into anything else. We just\naccept that a is a scalar, bx^ is a vector, c(x^\u2227y^) is a bivector,\nd(x^\u2227y^\u2227z^) is a trivector, and their sum is something different. We can call\nthis new object a Geometric and write it as G.\n\nWriting it all out, we can see that in general a Geometric has eight\northogonal components:\n\nG=g+gxx^+gyy^+gzz^+gxyx^\u2227y^+gyzy^\u2227z^+gxzx^\u2227z^+gxyzx^\u2227y^\u2227z^(3.0)\n\nOne scalar component, three vector components, three bivector components, and\none trivector component.\n\nThis might feel like a lot to deal with, but remember that most of the time\nmost of those coefficients are zero.\n\nIf orthogonal objects don't mix, then the sum of any two geometrics, G1 and\nG2, is just the pairwise sum of their scalar, vector, bivector, and trivector\ncomponents. You'll never need this giant equation, but just for illustrative\npurposes:\n\nG1+G2=g1+g2+(g1x+g2x)x^+(g1y+g2y)y^+(g1z+g2z)z^+(g1xy+g2xy)x^\u2227y^+(g1yz+g2yz)y^\u2227z^+(g1xz+g2xz)x^\u2227z^+(g1xyz+g2xyz)x^\u2227y^\u2227z^(3.1)\n\nSo there we have it, adding disparate types is permitted it just doesn't\nsimplify!\n\n# Choosing The Vector Product\n\nThe products we've mentioned so far are the dot product and the extrude\nproduct. You may also know about the cross product.\n\nNone of these are invertible.\n\nConsider the dot product:\n\ns=a\u22c5b=a1b1+a2b2+a3b3\n\nGiven:\n\nbs=y^=.7\n\nThere is no way to unambiguously recover a1,a2,a3:\n\nb\n\na?\n\na\u22c5b=s\n\nAll we can say is that a lies somewhere on the infinite plane which is\nperpendicular to b and passes through sb. There are infinitely many valid\nsolutions.\n\nThe extrude product gets closer but still fails:\n\nc\u21d2=a\u2227b\n\nGiven:\n\nb\u2225c\u21d2\u2225c\u21d2 lies in the =y^=21y^\u2227z^ plane\n\nb\n\na\u2227b=c\u21d2\n\na?\n\nNo matter which a you choose, as long as it lies on the line z=21,x=0, the\nresulting parallelogram will always lie in the y^\u2227z^ plane and its area will\nalways equal 21.\n\nIf the dot product constrains a to a plane, and the extrude product constrains\na to a line which passes through that plane...\n\nA Eureka moment is upon us!\n\nWhat if we define the Vector Product as:\n\nab=a\u22c5b+a\u2227b(4.0)\n\nWhich we read as:\n\n> The vector product ab equals the dot product a\u22c5b plus the extrude product\n> a\u2227b\n\nThe output is a Geometric with a scalar component s and a bivector component\nc\u21d2.\n\nVisually, if the dot product constrains a to a plane and the extrude product\nconstrains a to a line that passes through that plane, then the only value of\na which satisfies both constraints lies at the point where the line intersects\nthe plane\n\nb\n\na\u2227b=c\u21d2\n\na\n\na\u22c5b=s\n\nWe write the vector product as ab in direct analogy to how we write scalar\nmultiplication like 7x or 2c because it behaves so similarly.\n\nThe Vector Product is very important so let's examine it a few ways.\n\n# Examining the Vector Product\n\nWhat happens when we plug in two of the same vector?\n\naa=a\u22c5a+a\u2227a=\u2225a\u2225\u2225a\u2225cos\u03b8+\u2225a\u2225\u2225a\u2225sin\u03b8=\u2225a\u2225\u2225a\u2225cos0+\u2225a\u2225\u2225a\u2225sin0=\u2225a\u2225\u2225a\u2225=\u2225a\u22252(5.0)\n\nAnd just like that we've learned what it means to take the square of a vector!\n\na2=\u2225a\u22252(5.1)\n\nAny vector squared yields a scalar equal to the magnitude of that vector,\nsquared.\n\nBuckle up because we're really going to start moving quickly now.\n\nConsider the quantity a2a. What happens if you multiply it by a?\n\n(a2a)a=a2a2=1(5.2)\n\na times the quantity a2a equals 1. That means a2a is the inverse of a:\n\na\u22121=a2a(5.3)\n\nJust like scalars, vectors can be meaningfully inverted! Apparently the\ninverse of a vector is just that same vector, but scaled so that its new\nmagnitude squared is the inverse of its old magnitude squared. Writing in a\nmore suggestive way:\n\na\u22121=\u2225a\u222521a(5.4)\n\nQualitatively: The inverse of a big vector is a small vector that points in\nthe same direction.\n\nWhat happens if we swap the order of the input vectors?\n\nThe dot product is commutative:\n\na\u22c5b=b\u22c5a(5.5)\n\nAnd we know from equation 1.1 that the extrude product is anticommutative:\n\na\u2227b=\u2212b\u2227a(1.1)\n\nSo the vector product ba:\n\nba=b\u22c5a+b\u2227a(5.6)\n\nCan be rewritten as:\n\nba=a\u22c5b\u2212a\u2227b(5.7)\n\nWhich is more similar to our original definition:\n\nab=a\u22c5b+a\u2227b(4.0)\n\nJust for practice, let's add equations 5.7 and 4.0 to get:\n\nab+ba=a\u22c5b\u2212a\u2227b+a\u22c5b+a\u2227b=2a\u22c5b(5.8)\n\nDividing both sides by 2 gives us an explicit formula for the dot product in\nterms of the vector product!\n\na\u22c5b=2ab+ba(5.9)\n\nIf we subtract equation 5.7 from equation 4.0 we get:\n\nab\u2212ba=a\u22c5b+a\u2227b\u2212a\u22c5b+a\u2227b=2a\u2227b(5.10)\n\nWhich, after dividing both sides by 2, gives an explicit formula for the\nextrude product in terms of the vector product!\n\na\u2227b=2ab\u2212ba(5.11)\n\nThese two equations aren't super useful on their own, it's just nice to get\nour hands dirty and do some algebraic manipulation with our new tools.\n\nWhat if we plug in unit vectors?\n\nx^y^=x^\u22c5y^+x^\u2227y^\n\nThe dot product of two orthogonal vectors is always 0, so:\n\nx^y^=x^\u2227y^(5.12)\n\nThis is an incredibly convenient result! It means that we can stop writing our\nunit bivectors as x^\u2227y^ and instead start writing them as x^y^ which is much\nmore compact.\n\nGiven that x^\u2227y^=\u2212y^\u2227x^, it is clear that\n\nx^y^=\u2212y^x^(5.13)\n\nSo our freedom to swap the order of any two adjacent unit vectors at the cost\nof a minus sign still holds!\n\nRepeating the exercise for other unit vectors gives us the full set:\n\nx^y^y^z^x^z^=x^\u2227y^=y^\u2227z^=x^\u2227z^(5.14)\n\nx^y^y^z^x^z^=\u2212y^x^=\u2212z^y^=\u2212z^x^(5.15)\n\nWith these identities we'll be able to easily rearrange almost any equation\nwe're given!\n\nWe created equation 4.0 to give us a way to multiply two vectors together. Can\nit cope if we start throwing bivectors at it? Let's try multiplying the\nbivector x^y^ times the unit vector z^.\n\n(x^y^)z^=(x^y^)\u22c5z^+(x^y^)\u2227z^(5.16)\n\nWell, what does it mean to take the dot product between the x^y^ plane and the\nz^ vector? Normally we visualize the dot product by projecting one argument\nonto the other, and in this case the z^ vector is completely orthogonal to the\nx^y^ plane. It casts no \"shadow\".\n\nSo even though we haven't developed a formula for how to compute the dot\nproduct of a bivector with a vector, I think it makes sense to say that:\n\n(x^y^)\u22c5z^=0(5.17)\n\nThat leaves us with\n\n(x^y^)z^=(x^y^)\u2227z^(5.18)\n\nWhich is just ordinary extrusion of a bivector along a vector. Substituting in\nequation 5.12 we see that:\n\nx^y^z^=x^\u2227y^\u2227z^(5.19)\n\nAnother huge notational win! The unit trivector can be written as x^y^z^!\n\nWhat about two of the same unit vector?\n\nx^x^=x^\u22c5x^+x^\u2227x^=1+0=1\n\nWhoa. Repeating for each unit vector, we see that:\n\nx^x^y^y^z^z^=1=1=1(5.20)\n\nIn fact, any unit-length vector is its own inverse! This combined with 5.15\nwill help us simplify complex expressions!\n\nNow that we can simplify complicated expressions, let's make some! What\nhappens if we try to square the x^y^ unit bivector?\n\n(x^y^)2=x^y^x^y^(5.21)\n\nHere I'm just writing out what it means to square something; I haven't plugged\nit in to our special vector product formula. We know from 5.15 that we can\nswap the last two axes and bring in a minus sign:\n\n(x^y^)2=x^y^(\u2212y^x^)\n\nAnd we know from equation 1.0 that we can freely move coefficients around:\n\n(x^y^)2=\u2212x^y^y^x^\n\nThe two y^'s cancel:\n\n(x^y^)2=\u2212x^x^\n\nAnd the two x^'s cancel:\n\n(x^y^)2=\u22121(5.22)\n\nWhoa.\n\nApparently, the unit bivector that lives in the x^y^ plane squares to negative\none! Without resorting to anything \"imaginary\", we've stumbled upon an object\nwith the property we normally assign to the imaginary number i! Maybe our new\nsystem of algebra can do some of the things that we normally rely on complex\nnumbers to do, like 2D rotations?\n\nThis property is so remarkable to stumble upon that I think we should feel\nfree to refer to the x^y^ unit bivector as just i\u21d2 for short!\n\nInstead of thinking of complex numbers as a+bi maybe we can write them as\na+bi\u21d2 or a+bx^y^. As an exercise for the reader: can you prove that this\nsystem behaves identically to the complex numbers we normally learn about?\n\nBut there was nothing special about the x^y^ unit bivector that gave us this\nstrange property. Does it hold with the y^z^ unit bivector?\n\n(y^z^)2=y^z^y^z^=\u2212y^z^z^y^=\u2212y^y^=\u22121(5.23)\n\nThis is wild! We apparently have two \"imaginary numbers\" and they are\northogonal to each other! We can't just call this one i\u21d2 as well. Maybe we'll\ncall this one j\u21d2?\n\nFor completeness' sake let's try the last one:\n\n(x^z^)2=x^z^x^z^=\u2212z^x^x^z^=\u2212z^z^=\u22121(5.24)\n\nWhich is unsurprising the third time around, I guess. This plane is orthogonal\nto both of the previous planes so let's call it k\u21d2!\n\nApparently our new algebraic system based on Geometrics permits three mutually\northogonal \"imaginary numbers\" corresponding to the three unit bivectors!\n\nIf you've ever studied quaternions you might remember the fundamental equation\nthat defines them:\n\ni2=j2=k2=ijk=\u22121(5.25)\n\nAnd how strikingly similar our current situation seems to be!\n\nNow that we have bivector definitions for i\u21d2, j\u21d2, and k\u21d2, let's see if that\nfinal, crucial identity holds?\n\ni\u21d2j\u21d2k\u21d2=(x^y^)(y^z^)(x^z^)=x^y^y^z^x^z^=x^z^x^z^=\u2212z^x^x^z^=\u2212z^z^=\u22121(5.26)\n\nFantastic! Our new system of algebra conforms to the same fundamental rules\nthat govern quaternions!\n\nPerhaps our new algebra will be useful for some of the things that quaternions\nare useful for, like 3D rotations!\n\n# A Quick Warmup (Start here if you just need a refresher)\n\nWe're now armed with a robust set of identities, tools for simplifying\ncomplexity, and even a few hints at what directions we might want to explore.\nIt's time to see what our newly invented form of algebra can do!\n\nFirst let's do a quick practice problem just to get a taste. We're going to\nsimplify:\n\nG=(x^+y^)(z^+x^y^z^)\n\nWe're just dealing with normal algebra here. Use the FOIL method:\n\nG=x^z^+x^x^y^z^+y^z^+y^x^y^z^\n\nLet's simplify the second term because x^ is its own inverse:\n\nG=x^z^+y^z^+y^z^+y^x^y^z^\n\nOn the final term let's swap the middle x^ and y^ and add our minus sign:\n\nG=x^z^+y^z^+y^z^\u2212y^y^x^z^\n\nRemembering that y^2=1:\n\nG=x^z^+y^z^+y^z^\u2212x^z^\n\nThen combining like terms we see:\n\nG=2y^z^\n\nAnd that's what it feels like to use our new algebra! We did all that work to\ndefine the vector product and derive a bunch of identities, but most of our\nactual manipulations boil down to just swapping vector order and adding minus\nsigns, or cancelling out squared unit vectors.\n\nOther than these new rules, the system we've created behaves just like normal\nalgebra!\n\n# Vectors as Transformations\n\nIn Matrix Algebra we often employ transformations that look like:\n\nA\u2032=MAM\u22121\n\nAnd when working with quaternions we can rotate vectors like:\n\nv\u2032=qvq\u22121\n\nThis form of equation is sometimes called the sandwich product for obvious\nreasons. If you've never seen it before, just know that it pops up everywhere.\n\nSo it isn't a huge leap to ask: What happens when we use a vector as a\ntransformation? We can invert them and multiply them now, so let's try!\n\nThe formula for applying a transformation (sandwich) is:\n\na\u2032=tat\u22121(7.0)\n\nOur input vector will be something simple like:\n\na=.5y^+.707z^\n\nThe vector we'll transform it by will also be simple; let's use:\n\nt=.5z^\n\nWe already know how to find the inverse vector using equation 5.4:\n\nt\u22121=2z^\n\nPlugging it all in:\n\na\u2032=tat\u22121=(.5z^)(.5y^+.707z^)(2z^)\n\nLet's pull out the constants .5 and 2 to the very front and let them cancel:\n\na\u2032=.5\u22172(z^)(.5y^+.707z^)(z^)=(z^)(.5y^+.707z^)(z^)\n\nWe can distribute the leftmost z^, taking care to keep it on the left of any\nexisting unit vectors:\n\na\u2032=(.5z^y^+.707z^z^)(z^)=(.5z^y^+.707)(z^)\n\nNow we can incorporate that rightmost z^:\n\na\u2032=.5z^y^z^+.707z^=\u2212.5z^z^y^+.707z^=\u2212.5y^+.707z^\n\nx^\n\ny^\n\nz^\n\na\n\na\u2032\n\nt\n\nIt looks like we reflected a across t as though it were a mirror!\n\nLet's verify that with a more 3D example, this time using:\n\na=.6(x^+y^+z^)\n\nt=t\u22121=x^\n\nPlugging into our transformation formula we see:\n\na\u2032=(x^).6(x^+y^+z^)(x^)=.6(x^)(x^+y^+z^)(x^)=.6(x^x^+x^y^+x^z^)(x^)=.6(x^x^x^+x^y^x^+x^z^x^)=.6(x^\u2212x^x^y^\u2212x^x^z^)=.6(x^\u2212y^\u2212z^)\n\nx^\n\ny^\n\nz^\n\na\n\na\u2032\n\nt\n\nWhich confirms our finding from the simpler, 2D case!\n\nThis is a refreshing change in perspective. Ordinarily we think of reflections\nhappening only in mirrors which are planes, but the tools we've derived here\nlet us compute reflections across vectors, without having to define any sort\nof plane!\n\nSo it turns out that if we use them in a sandwich product, vectors are more\nthan just values\u2014they are transformations.\n\n> When used as transformations, vectors act as mirrors.\n\nThe title of this post is What is the Inverse of a Vector? The answer is that\nthe inverse a vector is the missing piece that lets us view vectors as\nactions, not just objects. Vectors and their inverses reflect.\n\n# Transforming Twice\n\nThis is the last section with math in it and the most important to remember.\n\nWhat happens if we reflect a around t and then reflect the result around u?\n\na\u2032=tat\u22121(7.0)\n\na\u2032\u2032=u(tat\u22121)u\u22121(8.0)\n\nI'm finding this a little hard to read so I'll temporarily drop the arrow\nsigns, but we're still talking about vectors:\n\na\u2032\u2032=u(tat\u22121)u\u22121\n\nAnd we're just exploring here so let's arbitrarily define:\n\na=.6(x^+y^+z^)\n\nt=t\u22121=y^\n\nu=u\u22121=z^\n\nSo, plugging it all in:\n\na\u2032\u2032=z^(y^\u2217.6(x^+y^+z^)y^)z^=z^y^\u2217.6(x^+y^+z^)y^z^=.6(z^y^x^+z^y^y^+z^y^z^)y^z^=.6(z^y^x^y^z^+z^y^y^y^z^+z^y^z^y^z^)=.6(x^z^y^y^z^+z^y^z^\u2212z^z^y^y^z^)=.6(x^z^z^\u2212y^z^z^\u2212y^y^z^)=.6(x^\u2212y^\u2212z^)\n\nx^\n\ny^\n\nz^\n\na\n\na\u2032\n\na\u2032\u2032\n\nt\n\nu\n\nWe reflected our input vector across y^ and then the result across z^.\n\nBut wait a second, if you reflect a right-handed glove you get a left-handed\nglove. If you reflect that one more time you're back to a right-handed glove,\njust rotated. Two reflections in series are equivalent to a single rotation!\n\nSo what rotation have we performed here?\n\nx^\n\ny^\n\nz^\n\na\n\na\u2032\u2032\n\nt\n\nu\n\nWe have rotated our input vector a by 2\u03b8 in the t\u2227u plane, where \u03b8 is the\nangle between t and u. In this case \u03b8=90\u00b0.\n\nSomehow our simple algebraic rules of swapping and cancelling have produced an\noperation that normally involves trigonometry or rotation matrices or\nquaternions! Using just two vectors and a sandwich product, we have\nimplemented 3D rotation!\n\nRearranging the equation 8.0 stresses the combined transformation:\n\na\u2032\u2032=(ut)a(ut)\u22121(9.0)\n\nThe product of two vectors can therefore be thought of as a rotor, because it\nrotates things.\n\n> The Rotor ut will rotate the input by 2\u03b8 in the ut plane, where \u03b8 is the\n> angle between u and t\n\nThe extra factor of 2 comes from the fact that the rotor is applied twice:\nonce on the left and once on the right in the sandwich product.\n\nEvery rotor includes a bivector part and a scalar part which might equal zero.\nThat means every bivector is also a rotor.\n\nIf vectors perform reflection, bivectors perform rotation. Can you figure out\nfor yourself what action trivectors perform?\n\n# A New Foundation for Physics\n\nEvery new physics student stumbles when learning about angular momentum and\ntorque.\n\nThe world of linear momentum and linear forces is relatively intuitive. It is\nself-consistent in the sense that vectors can be added together meaningfully,\nprovided you use scalars where required to make units compatible.\n\nThen you learn about angular momentum and torque and you have to introduce a\nBizarro World version of vectors called \"pseudovectors\" or \"axial vectors\"\nwhich are compatible with each other but are incompatible with regular\nvectors. It is never correct to add a pseudovector like angular momentum to a\nregular vector like linear momentum and you just have to memorize which ones\nbelong to which camp.\n\nEven worse, some physics curriculums don't even call out the difference\nbetween axial vectors and regular vectors, they just assume you will pick up\non their patterns implicitly. Many students never pick up this intuition and\nconsequently believe themselves to be \"bad at physics\".\n\nPseudovectors as we typically teach them are actually bivectors. They can be\nwritten using 3 numbers, but their true nature is tied to the fact that they\nare oriented pieces of area, not length.\n\nIf we teach students about bivectors and if we write them using their full\nnotation like:\n\nb\u21d2=b1x^y^+b2y^z^+b3x^z^\n\nIt is obvious from the beginning that pseudovectors and vectors have similar\nstructure but are incompatible types.\n\nThe equation for torque that we're taught in high school physics is:\n\n\u03c4=r\u00d7F\n\nBut it is equally correct and far simpler to teach:\n\n\u03c4=r\u2227F(10.0)\n\nWhich means torque is a bivector living in the plane defined by r and F, not a\npseudovector perpendicular to them. There is no need to introduce the cross\nproduct or the right-hand rule at all when teaching rotational dynamics.\n\nAll bivectors are also rotors, so this new definition is self-consistent in\nthe colloquial sense that torque, being a rotor, rotates things. Angular\nvelocity, also a rotor, is a measure of how much rotation is occurring!\n\nA similar problem occurs when students take the conceptual leap from electric\nfields to magnetic fields. The electric field is a vector field which lets\nthem build intuition, but then the magnetic field is a pseudovector field\nwhich just tosses their intuition out the window.\n\nThe magnetic field, like torque and every other pseudovector in physics, is\nbetter thought of as a bivector.\n\nIf you represent the electric field with vectors and the magnetic field with\nbivectors, then they can naturally coexist in a single Geometric that\nrepresents the combined electromagnetic field.\n\nIf you pull on that thread, you can write out a single Geometric equation:\n\n\u2207F=c\u03b51J\n\nWhich, when broken down into its scalar, vector, bivector, and trivector\ncomponents, corresponds to Maxwell's four equations! All of electricity and\nmagnetism in one single equation!\n\nThe word \"Pseudoscalar\" also comes up in physics to describe scalar-like\nquantities that change their sign under reflection. The basic examples we\nlearn are Magnetic Charge and Magnetic Flux, but the concept crops up later in\nfluid dynamics as the Stream Function and in quantum mechanics as Helicity.\nAll of these are in fact just trivectors. In a mirror, trivectors behave\ndifferently than scalars do because mirrors change handedness.\n\nSpeaking of quantum mechanics, the defining traits of the Pauli Spin Matricies\nare that they all square to one and they are mutually orthogonal. They are\njust the unit vectors x^, y^, z^ dressed up as matrices!\n\nThe algebra we have learned today is a better, simpler model of the universe\nthan the one we teach students in school. It is easier to learn and easier to\nteach. It extends beautifully to the concept of 4D spacetime, which makes\nspecial relativity far easier to understand.\n\nThe normal approach to physics notation is to learn standard 3D vector\nnotation, then patch over it as needed to reconcile the physical reality with\nthe limits of the notation:\n\n  * Complex Numbers\n  * Quaternions\n  * Pauli Spinors\n  * Minkowski 4-Vectors\n  * Dirac Spinors\n\nAll of these are band-aids over a fundamentally limited system. The\nalternative is to teach the Geometric Algebra we've started learning today,\nwhich encompasses the dynamics of all of these lesser systems.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nSo, what is the inverse of a vector?\n\nIt turns out that inverting a vector on its own isn't well defined. We have to\ninvert a vector with respect to some kind of multiplication, and we are free\nto invent new kinds of multiplication!\n\nBeyond that we can invent entire new structures: bivectors and trivectors, and\nwe get to choose what multiplication and inversion should mean when dealing\nwith these new objects!\n\nThe math we are taught in school is not handed down by the Gods themselves, it\nis invented in small pieces by human beings. It changes over time and supports\nregional dialects just like spoken language.\n\nWe can contribute to it. We can change it.\n\nMany people, including many engineers and scientists, view math as just rote\nmemorization of formulas or rigid steps to complete some task. But that's like\ntaking one semester of Spanish and viewing the entire Spanish language as\nnothing but rote memorization of vocabulary and steps to complete a\nconversation. It completely misses the point.\n\nMath is a living language and learning how to use it is a form of\nenculturation. Anyone can create new math in the same way that anyone can\nwrite a new poem or a new short story.\n\nI firmly believe that in 100 years, Geometric Algebra will be the dominant way\nof introducing students to mathematical physics. In the same way that Newton's\nnotation for Calculus is no longer the dominant one, or that Maxwell's actual\nequations for Electromagnetism have been replaced by Heaviside's, textbooks\nwill change because a better system has come along.\n\nUnlike those examples, the change from Gibb's vector notation to Geometric\nAlgebra is something we're living through right now. New Youtube videos and\ntextbooks are coming out all the time that incorporate this superior approach.\nPick one up and be part of the revolution!\n\n# Geometric Algebra Cheat Sheet\n\nx^2=y^2=z^2=1\n\n(x^y^)2=(y^z^)2=(x^z^)2=\u22121\n\n(x^y^)(y^z^)(x^z^)=\u22121\n\n(x^y^z^)2=\u22121\n\nab=a\u22c5b+a\u2227b\n\na\u22c5b=b\u22c5a=2ab+ba\n\na\u2227b=\u2212b\u2227a=2ab\u2212ba\n\n(ab)\u22121=b\u22121a\u22121\n\na\u2032=tat\u22121\n\na\u2032\u2032=u(tvt\u22121)u\u22121=(ut)a(ut)\u22121\n\n# Contact me\n\nIf you would like to tell me in excruciating detail exactly what I said wrong\nin this post, I'm on Twitter at @mferraro89.
