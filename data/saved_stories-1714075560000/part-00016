Universities\n\nBy AFP News 04/25/24 AT 1:14 AM EDT\n\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on\nFlipboard Share on Pocket\n\nTexas deployed police in riot gear at the University of Texas in Austin where\nhundreds of protesters staged a boisterous walkout, chanting \"down with\noccupation.\" AFP\n\nSpiraling pro-Palestinian protests that are rocking universities across the\nUnited States spread to more campuses Wednesday, triggering suggestions from a\nsenior Republican leader that the National Guard could be brought in.\n\nThe comments from House Speaker Mike Johnson are likely to evoke strong\nemotions in a country where the 1970 killing by National Guardsmen of unarmed\nstudents protesting the Vietnam War lives on in folk memory.\n\nDemonstrations erupted at the University of Southern California on Wednesday,\nand in Texas, where a tense stand-off developed between students and police in\nriot gear, with more than 20 people detained.\n\nIt was the latest confrontation between law enforcement and students angry at\nthe mounting death toll in Israel's war against Hamas.\n\nThe movement began at Columbia University in New York where dozens of arrest\nwere made last week after university authorities called in police to quell an\noccupation that Jewish students said was threatening and anti-Semitic.\n\nJohnson told reporters at Columbia that if the demonstrations were not\ncontained quickly it would be \"an appropriate time for the National Guard.\"\n\nHe said he intended to demand US President Joe Biden \"take action,\" and warned\nthat the demonstrations \"place a target on the backs of Jewish students in the\nUnited States.\"\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden backed free speech.\n\n\"The president believes that free speech, debate and nondiscrimination on\ncollege campuses are important,\" she told reporters.\n\nUS ally Israel launched its war in Gaza after the Hamas attack on October 7\nthat left around 1,170 people dead, according to an AFP tally of Israeli\nofficial figures.\n\nStudent protesters say they are expressing solidarity with Palestinians in\nGaza, where the death toll has topped 34,200, according to the Hamas-run\nhealth ministry, and are calling on Columbia and other universities to divest\nfrom companies with ties to Israel.\n\nThe demonstrators -- including a number of Jewish students -- have disavowed\ninstances of anti-Semitism.\n\nBut pro-Israel supporters, and others worried about campus safety, have\npointed to anti-Semitic incidents and argued that campuses are encouraging\nintimidation and hate speech.\n\nJohnson's visit to Columbia came as Texas deployed police in riot gear at the\nUniversity of Texas in Austin where hundreds of protesters staged a boisterous\nwalkout, chanting \"down with occupation.\"\n\nPolice said they had arrested more than 20 people, with the state's governor\nGreg Abbott urging swift punishment.\n\n\"These protesters belong in jail,\" he wrote on social media.\n\n\"Students joining in hate-filled, antisemitic protests at any public college\nor university in Texas should be expelled.\"\n\nPolice were on scene in Los Angeles after hundreds of students began what they\ncalled an occupation on the campus of the University of Southern California.\n\nStudents chanted \"Free free Palestine\" as well as the controversial slogan\n\"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,\" which some interpret as\ncalling for the destruction of the state of Israel.\n\n\"We're all just trying to advocate for our brothers and sisters in Palestine\nwho just don't have voice right now,\" biology student Yaseen El-Magharbel told\nAFP.\n\nThe university said it was closing the campus to outside visitors, though\nclasses and other activities would continue.\n\nStudents have also launched protests at schools including Yale, MIT, UC\nBerkeley, the University of Michigan and Brown.\n\nSocial media images showed an encampment taking shape at Harvard University.\n\nClasses were moved online and other on-campus activities canceled at\nCalifornia State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, after protesters barricaded\nthemselves in a campus building.\n\nMore than 130 people were arrested at a pro-Palestinian protest at New York\nUniversity Monday night.\n\nAnd police at the University of Minnesota reportedly detained nine people at\nan encampment.\n\nNBC reported that the FBI is coordinating with universities over anti-Semitic\nthreats and possible violence in connection with the ongoing wave of protests.\n\nBefore Johnson's visit to Columbia an uneasy truce was in place between\nstudents and officials.\n\nThe university had set a deadline of midnight Tuesday to disperse, but as more\npeople joined the protest the school gave a 48-our extension, students said on\nsocial media.\n\nThey agreed to the ongoing talks after the school promised not to call the\npolice or National Guard, organizers with Columbia University Apartheid Divest\nsaid.\n\n\"We fear that Columbia is risking a second Jackson State or Kent State\nmassacre,\" the group said in the social media post.\n\nIn 1970, demonstrations at Kent State University in Ohio were met with deadly\nforce from the National Guard, who fired into a crowd, killing four unarmed\nstudents and wounding nine.\n\nEleven days later, Jackson State in Mississippi also saw police confront\nstudent protesters and open fire, killing two and injuring 12.\n\nStudents have also launched protests at schools including Yale, MIT, UC\nBerkeley, the University of Michigan and Brown.
