Mailead\nensures high deliverability which helps your business grow while offering the\nbest limits on the market.\n\n#### How does the \"unlimited mailboxes\" feature benefit me?\n\nOur \"unlimited mailboxes\" feature allows you to expand your email\ncommunications without restrictions imposed by a mailbox limit. This means you\nwon't be constrained by artificial caps on the number of mailboxes you can\nconnect and use. This feature makes Mailead the best cold email software and\nempowers you to reach a wider audience, engage with more potential customers,\nand manage diverse email campaigns effectively.\n\n#### How many emails can I send daily?\n\nThere are no restrictions. It's advisable to send around 30 emails per day per\nsending email account to avoid ending up in spam folders (restriction from\nGoogle and Yahoo). Therefore, it's recommended to connect multiple sending\nemail accounts to increase the number of emails sent per day and consequently\nimprove the return rate.\n\n#### How many campaign sequence steps can I create?\n\nThere is no cap on the number of sequence steps you can create; feel free to\nadd as many as needed.\n\n#### Is Mailead totally automated?\n\nThe process is straightforward: simply upload your lead list and configure\nyour campaigns (our AI Assistant will guide you through this). From that point\nonwards, the system will operate autonomously without any further input\nrequired.\n\n#### What are Active Contacts?\n\nActive Contacts refer to the distinct email addresses you've engaged with over\nthe course of a month. This count is reset at the beginning of each new month,\nallowing you to connect with an unlimited number of fresh, unique email\naddresses (contacts) during that period. There's no requirement to remove\nprevious contacts. The focus is solely on the quantity of new individuals you\ncan outreach to within the monthly timeframe.\n\n#### What if a campaign spans multiple months? How are Active Contacts counted\nin that scenario?\n\nActive Contacts are tallied solely based on the initial email within a\nsequence. For instance, if you kickstarted a campaign with 5,000 contacts in\nJanuary, and it extended into February, the follow-up emails in February would\nnot contribute to your monthly Active Contacts count for that month, as\ncredits are only deducted for the first email in every sequence. Even if a\ncampaign continues into a new month, subsequent follow-ups do not consume your\ncredits for that new month.\n\n#### Do you offer a service to supply leads for email outreach?\n\nCertainly!
