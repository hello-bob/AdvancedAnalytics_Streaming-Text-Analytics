Recent events on campuses across the country have forced many of\nus to look more closely at how our own universities work. I have no special\ninsight into most aspects of the Columbia protests or the administration\u2019s\nresponse. But as someone who studies public law and nonprofit law, I have been\nstruck by a number of legal-institutional forces that helped bring Columbia to\nits current conjuncture\u2014all of which relate, in various mutually reinforcing\nways, to the power of the president\u2019s office.1\\. Presidential Administration\nComes to the UniversityFor all the talk of how the modern university has been\ncorporatized, neoliberalized, and so on, there hasn\u2019t been as much attention\npaid to the ways in which it has been presidentialized.The presidentialization\nof Columbia dates back well before the current moment. Our last president, Lee\nBollinger, ran the university for over two decades. During his tenure,\nBollinger oversaw the rise of a substantial administrative apparatus\u2014the ten\nhighest paid Columbia employees, apart from surgeons, are now all senior\nexecutives\u2014as well as the creation of a dizzying array of research centers,\npolicy institutes, and global programs that operate more or less independently\nof the academic departments. Bollinger\u2019s office also launched countless\nsmaller projects with discretionary funds. After the insurrection at the\nCapitol on January 6, 2021, for instance, he came up with the idea for a\nConstitutional Democracy Initiative (with which I am affiliated) and, within\nweeks, an impressive new outfit was up and running. Meanwhile, the most\nbroadly representative body on campus, the University Senate, seemed to become\nless relevant with every passing year.This basic dynamic is familiar to\nscholars of U.S. public law, who have long documented the growth of executive\npower relative to Congress and the growth of presidential power within the\nexecutive branch\u2014what Justice Elena Kagan famously termed \u201cpresidential\nadministration.\u201d Under presidential administration, as Kagan describes it,\nregulatory activity increasingly becomes \u201can extension of [the president\u2019s]\nown policy and political agenda.\u201d This mode of governance has some real\nbenefits, above all energy and efficiency. And President Bollinger did many\nvaluable things for the university. Yet by the time he created a\nconstitutional democracy initiative, Columbia\u2019s own democratic life had\nwithered considerably.The stage was thus set for some of the most\ncontroversial moves made by Bollinger\u2019s successor, President Minouche Shafik.\nShafik has made a series of \u201cbold\u201d decisions without first securing community\nsupport. These include unilaterally revising event policies and calling the\ncops on student protesters in defiance of the senate executive committee\u2019s\nunanimous opposition. If Shafik has broken with various specific campus norms,\nhowever, we should acknowledge that the brand of centralized leadership she\nbrings to Columbia is nothing new, and on the contrary is precisely what is\nexpected of a modern university president.2\\. Faculty Just Work HereProfessors\nfortunate enough to have tenure may get the impression that they are pretty\nbig deals on campus. They have extraordinary job security. They hold\nsignificant power over their students\u2019 educations and career prospects. And\nthe job description\u2014publishing original research, applying for grants, giving\nlectures\u2014doesn\u2019t tend to select for or reward modesty. Within their classrooms\nand departments, full-time faculty exercise some meaningful agency and\nauthority.It therefore came as a rude awakening for many faculty members at\nColumbia to learn just how little decisional authority we collectively wield\nat the university level. When the senate executive committee opposed Shafik\u2019s\ncrackdown on the student encampment, she went ahead and did it anyway\u2014and\nthere was nothing, under the University Charter and Statutes, that the\ncommittee or its formidable chair Jeanine D\u2019Armiento could do about it. The\nfull senate then considered a censure resolution. Had it passed, this act of\nresistance likewise would have had only symbolic effect. President Shafik was\nhired by, serves on, and reports to the board of trustees, whose members are\nlargely chosen by ... the board of trustees. Faculty are on the outside\nlooking in.To simplify somewhat, we might say that professors are granted a\nnumber of basic rights within the university, including rights to free speech\nand due process and quasi-property rights in the job itself. Students and\nstaff are granted a partially overlapping, though weaker, bundle of rights.\nWhat none of us have are governance rights against the trustees who really run\nthe place. We enjoy various individual privileges and protections, but not the\nfranchise.Legal scholars and political scientists have a term for this sort of\narrangement, too: liberal autocracy. Although self-perpetuating boards of\ntrustees have long controlled universities like Columbia, the salience of this\nfeature tends to fade during periods of relative harmony and prosperity. As\nthe Columbia administration\u2019s actions over the past six months became\nincreasingly contentious, and increasingly detached from ideals of academic\nfreedom, the autocratic character of our governance model came to the fore.3\\.\nThe Myth of the Endowment BufferWhile President Shafik has not been\nparticularly responsive to the views of faculty majorities, she is often\ndepicted as being highly attuned to the demands of major donors and rabble-\nrousing politicians (who have, in turn, started making Columbia-related\ndemands on one another). The same is true of Shafik\u2019s counterparts at peer\nschools. This point about donor and politico influence is almost too obvious\nto make, except that it conceals a puzzle. Columbia\u2019s endowment is worth $14\nbillion. Even if the endowment has been poorly managed, as Adam Tooze recently\ndemonstrated, isn\u2019t that enough money in the bank to insulate the president\nfrom the most intrusive demands?The leading treatment of this issue in the\nlegal literature is Henry Hansmann\u2019s 1990 article \u201cWhy Do Universities Have\nEndowments?\u201d Among Hansmann\u2019s answers to his titular question is that a large\nendowment may \u201cserve to protect a university administration ... from the need\nto cater too closely to the desires of those who ultimately provide the\ninstitution\u2019s income\u2014whether they be students, private donors, or the\ngovernment.\u201d The endowment, that is, provides a financial buffer not just\nagainst unexpected economic shocks but also against unwelcome external\npressures of all sorts. In theory, this looks like one of the best arguments\nagainst universities spending a significantly higher percentage of their\nendowments each year.In practice, however, the argument turns out to be\nmistaken, or at least to be in need of serious qualification. What it misses\nis the sociology of the modern endowment. Over the past generation or so,\nhaving a large endowment has become something more than a means to support\nlongstanding institutional goals; it has become an end in itself, a key\nmeasure of a university\u2019s prestige and its president\u2019s performance. And\nbecause most philanthropists don\u2019t like to fund boring old operating budgets,\nexpanding the endowment is often accomplished through conditional gifts for\nenticing new endeavors, as reflected in the proliferation of extra-\ndepartmental centers, institutes, and programs referred to above. Once\nlaunched, these non-tuition-receiving entities\u2014and all the jobs, faculty\nfiefdoms, and student opportunities that come with them\u2014only tend to increase\nthe demand for ongoing donations.The endowment, in short, always needs to keep\ngrowing, according to the logic of those who run and rate elite universities,\nwhich means that major donors always need to be cultivated while their\npolitical patrons are placated. This dynamic degrades the endowment\u2019s capacity\nto serve as a buffer against populist and plutocratic pressures alike. At the\nsame time, the fundraising and grandstanding pressures that it creates further\nfuel the presidentialization of the university.4\\. Legal Pluralism and Student\nSpeechIn the senate executive committee\u2019s recent compendium of actions taken\nby the administration \u201cthat have harmed Columbia University\u201d (pp. 23-24),\nseveral of the items involve the failure to utilize \u201clong-established\ndisciplinary processes.\u201d With regard to the past few months, at least, the\ncharge is not that the administration bypassed existing processes altogether\nor that it misapplied any particular process. The charge is that the\nadministration routed student protesters\u2019 cases to certain disciplinary\nchannels, rather than others, on the expectation that those channels would\nmete out swifter or sterner punishment. How could this be possible when\nColumbia\u2019s governing documents contain no emergency clause and when everyone\nat Columbia is subject to the same Rules of University Conduct?The answer is\nthat individuals at Columbia may be subject to three other sets of rules as\nwell: the Standards and Discipline Policy, the Equal Opportunity and\nAffirmative Action Policies and Procedures, and the Interim University Policy\nfor Safe Demonstrations (adopted this February). It is no easy task to figure\nout how these policies relate to one another. After weeks of studying this\nissue, a law school working group led by Jeremy Kessler produced a 12,000-word\nforensic analysis on which I have drawn. The most problematic policy this year\nhas been Standards and Discipline, both because it employs broader definitions\nof harassing and discriminatory speech than do the Rules of University Conduct\nand because it grants fewer procedural protections to the accused. In an\nOrwellian twist, this policy is administered by the Center for Student Success\nand Intervention (CSSI), which helps students flourish by denying them\nrepresentation in a process that could lead to their expulsion. Shafik\u2019s\nshenanigan, according to the University Senate, was to start charging student\nprotesters under the Standards and Discipline Policy, instead of the Rules of\nUniversity Conduct, so as to punish them more efficiently.In engaging in this\nbit of legal arbitrage, the university administration toggled between not only\ndifferent procedural frameworks but also different normative visions of\nstudent speech and discipline. The Rules of University Conduct were adopted\nafter the convulsive campus protests of 1968. They aim to secure a wide berth\nfor political expression and to stave off content- or viewpoint-discriminatory\nadministrative responses. In other words, they embody a liberal speech regime,\nwhich President Bollinger came to personify. The CSSI, by contrast, was\nestablished in 2022 and places greater emphasis on shielding vulnerable\nstudents from discriminatory harassment while promoting \u201cstudents\u2019 holistic\nwell-being\u201d and values of \u201cJustice, Equity, Diversity & Inclusion.\u201d It\nembodies a moral-therapeutic regime.President Shafik\u2019s critics suggest she has\nweaponized CSSI and its ethic of safetyism against pro-Palestinian protesters.\nHer defenders believe she has enlisted it appropriately in the cause of\ncombatting antisemitism. Either way, it\u2019s important to see that the\nadministration quietly asserted the authority to redirect more and more cases\nto a particular sort of disciplinary regime, which many experienced as\nunfamiliar and unfair, and that this was made possible by the emergence of\ninconsistent legal orders within the university.5\\. Title VI Theater?The same\ntension between free speech and antidiscrimination values that Columbia\u2019s\nrules try to negotiate is also, of course, a larger fault line in American\nlaw. While the First Amendment privileges political expression, Title VI of\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires universities that receive federal\nfunding to stamp out \u201charassment\u201d and \u201chostile environments\u201d based on race,\nreligion, and national origin. In recent months, Jewish and Israeli students\nhave sued or filed administrative complaints against Columbia for violating\nTitle VI, as have Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim students.Shortly before she\nsummoned the NYPD to Hamilton Hall last Tuesday, President Shafik\u2019s office\nsent multiple messages to the Columbia community stating that the Gaza\nSolidarity Encampment had contributed to \u201ca hostile environment\u201d for Jewish\nstudents and faculty, \u201cin violation of Title VI.\u201d These statements were\nremarkable on several levels.The Title VI threshold for university liability\nis high\u2014the discriminatory harassment must be so severe and pervasive as to\nprevent an individual from participating in educational programs\u2014and scholars\ncontinue to debate whether and to what extent Title VI applies to speech on\nmatters of public concern. My fellow Jewish colleagues and students hold a\nwide range of views on the encampment. (We are Jews, after all.) Yet however\nupsetting some may have found the takeover of the lawn, as well as any number\nof incidents before and since, it is not at all clear that the encampment\nplaced the university in violation of Title VI. That issue could be litigated\nfor years. Since when does Columbia go out of its way to concede liability?The\npoint can be pushed further. Legal standards such as hostile-environment\nharassment are not well suited to this situation. These standards assume a\nreasonably stable and widely shared baseline as to what counts as an act of\nintimidation, on the one hand, and what counts as public-spirited advocacy, on\nthe other. In the current context, however, that baseline is itself fiercely\ncontested. Students have disagreed about the boundaries of acceptable speech\nmany times before. But I cannot think of another instance where one group\u2019s\nasserted experience of discriminatory harassment corresponds so closely with\nanother group\u2019s asserted expression of political protest\u2014and where both groups\ncontain a substantial share of the student body. This campus speech debate has\nproduced so much more heat than light not only because of the horrifying\nviolence to which it responds, but also because it is taking place in the\nabsence of any consensus on the meaning or morality of core slogans and\nsymbols. Moreover, the debate is inextricably bound up with a higher-order\nargument about who gets to set the terms of acceptable discourse on Israel-\nPalestine issues.But let\u2019s say that I am wrong about all of this and the\nencampment did indisputably place the university in violation of Title VI.\nEven when a hostile environment or other acts of unlawful discrimination are\nfound to exist, university administrators are given discretion over how to\nrectify them. In private suits for money damages, administrators must show\nthat they were not \u201cdeliberately indifferent\u201d to discriminatory conditions.\nThe notion that a university must call in the cops to fulfill this obligation\nfinds no support in Title VI doctrine, as far as I\u2019m aware. That notion seems\nall the more bizarre in a context where many of the arrested students,\nincluding Jewish students, believe that they themselves have been subject to\ndiscriminatory treatment.I do not mean to assert that no Title VI violations\nhave occurred or to imply that President Shafik appealed to the statute in bad\nfaith. The law of Title VI in higher education settings is complicated; the\nfacts on the ground at Columbia have been complicated; and Shafik may well\nhave believed that the encampment crossed a new legal line. It is nevertheless\nhard to escape the conclusion that she invoked Title VI not so much in\nacknowledgment of a regrettable legal fact as in service of public\npersuasion\u2014as an effort to reassure audiences in Congress, the Department of\nEducation, and beyond that she is taking antisemitism seriously, and to\njustify to constituencies on campus the police raid that would soon follow.\nFrom everything I have seen since Tuesday, the internal persuasion strategy,\nat least, does not seem to have worked.* * *There is no shortage of immediate\nrepair work that needs to be done at Columbia, as at many other universities.\nBut if the thrust of this post is right, we should redirect some of our\ncritical attention away from President Shafik herself and toward the office\nshe occupies, away from the latest divisive decision and toward the decades-\nlong drift toward presidential administration, which shaped how that decision\ngot made. Reversing this drift, and developing a more democratic model of\ninternal governance, may be a prerequisite not only for rebuilding\nintellectual community but also for avoiding future campus\nconflagrations.Posted 9:45 AM by David Pozen [link]Older Posts Newer Posts\nHome| Books by Balkinization BloggersJack M.
