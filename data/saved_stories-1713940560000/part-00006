The measurements are not\nthoroughly done, hence the results are not yet very robust. However, the first\nresults already show quite an inspiring curve unveiling a beautiful natural\npattern!\n\nThis post tries to follow the scientific format of research sharing, developed\nover the last centuries: the use of a simple structure for quick reading\n(introduction, method, results, discussion), the supply of all the details for\nanyone to be able to reproduce the experiment, and the supply of the dataset\nfor anyone to reuse the results.\n\nIt is part of my bamboo craft project, where you can find bamboo craft ideas\nand tutorials.\n\n  * Introduction: objective\n  * Method: simple measurements\n  * Results: a beautiful pattern\n  * Discussion: do you want to try?\n\n## Introduction: objective\n\nBamboo fibers are very straight in internodes and entangled in nodes. Pole\nwalls tend to be thicker at the bottom of the pole and thinner at the top.\nThese kinds of variations have a significant impact on how the craftsman can\nwork with bamboo and what he can or cannot do with the different sections.\n\nFor instance, if a craftsman wants to cut a straight strip, its length will be\nlimited by the length of the internode. Moreover, the strips might tend to be\nthick for an internode that is close to the bottom of the pole, and thin for\nan internode that is close to the top of the pole. To build my trivet I used\nfor example an internode from the base of a bamboo pole. While for my\nunderwear dryer, a bamboo section with slightly thinner walls \u2014 located higher\nup \u2014 was sufficient.\n\nEven if many techniques can be used by the craftsman, for instance\nstraightening the strips using heat, understanding closely the structure of\nbamboo poles can elegantly save time and energy. The craftsman will know\nbetter which pole to harvest for a specific use, and fewer steps and tools\nmight then be necessary to reach the final crafted object. Experienced bamboo\ncraftmen already have this knowledge. But for beginners, trying to understand\nbamboo by observing it is very useful.\n\nFrom quick observations, the internodes of a bamboo pole seem shorter at the\nbase and longer at the top; and bamboo pole wall seems thicker at the bottom\nand thinner at the top. Do these dimensions really follow patterns all along\nthe pole, or are they actually hazardous? What might be the shapes of these\npatterns? And do these patterns depend on other variables, such as species?\n\nWell, let\u2019s have a look at how internode length and wall thickness vary along\na bamboo pole!\n\n## Method: simple measurements\n\nI harvested a full bamboo pole in northern Taiwan, and measured the length of\neach internode using a tape measure. I also measured the thickness of the wall\nat certain points using a ruler.\n\n### Internode length\n\nI started the measurement of internode length at the base of the pole, above\nthe level of the small roots covering the lower node. The measurement was\naccurate to the nearest centimeter, due to irregularities in the bamboo pole:\nthe limits corresponding to the nodes were not perpendicular to the axis of\nthe pole, but slightly tilted; and the diameter of the pole tended to be\nlarger at the level of nodes than in the internodes. Measurements are hence\nnot very precise but enough to meet our objectives.\n\n### Wall thickness\n\nI measured the wall thickness at the level of cuts that I did close to 4\nnodes. The measurement was accurate to the nearest 0.5 centimeters. As the\nwall thickness is not always even, I averaged 3 measures taken more or less at\nequidistance from one another. Measuring the wall thickness for each internode\nwould be ideal, but it would have required to cut the pole in small sections,\npreventing me to use it for other purposes that I planned \u2014 it is in\nparticular an internode of this bamboo from which I built the trivet!\n\n### Complementary variables\n\nI also recorded other variables to describe the context of the measurements:\n\n  * Date: December 18, 2018\n  * Location: northern Taiwan (24\u00b050\u201943.4\u201dN 121\u00b026\u201907.8\u201dE)\n  * Species: Phyllostachys reticulate (Chinese: \u6842\u7af9)\n  * Age: unknown, but > 1 year given the lichens developed on the pole\n  * Outer diameter at the base of the pole: 7.8 cm (3 in) with an error of about 0.5 cm (0.2 in) due to irregularities\n  * Full pole: no, some internodes appeared to be lacking at the top, they may have been eaten by animals or insects at a young age.\n\n## Results: a beautiful pattern\n\nThe bamboo pole contained 53 internodes and measured 13.62 m in total.\n\n### Internode length\n\nThe internode length was 10 cm at the base, increased till 38 cm roughly at\nthe middle of the pole, and decreased till 13 cm at the top of the pole.\nInternodes measured 26 cm on average. The visual representation of the\nmeasurements suggests two distinct parts: the length of the internodes follows\nlogarithmic-type dynamics in the lower half, then negative exponential-type\ndynamics in the upper half! So beautiful. Only bamboo can do this, right?\n\nThe visual representation of the measurements suggests two distinct parts: the\nlength of the internodes follows logarithmic-type dynamics in the lower half,\nthen negative exponential-type dynamics in the upper half!\n\n### Wall thickness\n\nThe wall thickness decreased from 12.5 mm on average at the base of the pole\nto 5 mm at the 14^th internode. I did 3 measurements for each of the 4\ninternodes measured, but some dots are merged on the figure, when values were\nidentical. I can infer a rough statistical model from these measurements, to\npredict the thickness of the wall depending on the location along the bamboo\npole. No data was collected for the internodes after the 14^th, but the model\nsuggests a potential wall thickness of about 2 mm for the last internode.\n\n## Discussion: do you want to try?\n\nThese measurements already help in understanding the anatomy of a bamboo pole.\nHowever, the dataset is quite small and restricted to only one bamboo, which\ndoes not make for our statistical model to be robust, despite its apparently\nhigh R^2 of about 0.99.\n\nImprovements could be done thanks to (1) a better measurement technique, as\nwell as (2) additional measurements of bamboo poles in other conditions:\n\n  1. The length of each internode could be measured as the average of the longer and shorter lengths between the tilted limits of the internode. The thickness of the wall could be measured systematically at the middle of each internode, instead of close to the nodes, as the wall appear to be thicker close to the nodes. Moreover, measuring several bamboo poles for a given species in a given location, instead of only one, would also improve the reliability of the results.\n\n  2. It is unlikely that internode length or wall thickness vary depending on the age of the bamboo pole, as bamboo does not have any secondary growth over its lifespan. However, it would be very interesting to see if there might be variations of patterns due to species and location!\n\nDo you also have measurements? Let me know! By combining our works, we could\nget more interesting results!\n\nNo need to have a complete data set, nor all the complementary variables. We\ncan perform interesting analysis even with missing data.\n\nLast udpdate: Nov 18, 2020\n\n## Would you like to follow my explorations?\n\nTo share my experiments, I write a monthly newsletter, called my \ud83d\udd2d Laboratory\nLogbook.
