We have to work on\nthat side hustle we stopped caring about months ago, finish that project for\nthe boss, and attend that neighbourhood meeting. The list goes on.\n\nSome of our obligations are necessary and important.\n\nThey reflect our values and responsibilities to those we care about.\n\nOur families, the people we love, and the people we live for.\n\nBut others, if we\u2019re honest, are self-imposed.\n\nWe volunteer for that extra work assignment, agree to head up that charity\ndrive, and sign up for that class we don\u2019t really have time for. We say yes to\nsocial commitments we\u2019re too tired to face \u2014 with people we\u2019re too tired to\nsee. We\u2019re overcommitting, taking on more and more.\n\nWhy do we do this to ourselves?\n\nFear, often.\n\nFear of missing out, letting down others, not measuring up to some\nimpossible\u2014even imagined\u2014standard. We\u2019re afraid that if we say no, we\u2019ll be\njudged, we\u2019ll fall behind, and we\u2019ll close doors. So we say yes, again and\nagain, until we\u2019re stretched thin and exhausted.\n\nBut every time we say yes to something we don\u2019t want or need to do, we\u2019re\nsaying no to something else.\n\nWe're saying no to time for ourselves, no to our true passions, no to our\nkids, no to our partners, no to space to breathe and just be.\n\nWe\u2019re putting on shackles of our own making.\n\nSo what\u2019s the solution?\n\nPrioritize ruthlessly. Take a hard look at your obligations and ask yourself:\nWhich are essential? Which reflect my deepest values and make the most impact?\nWhich brings me joy and fulfilment?\n\nKeep those, and start saying no to the rest.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy.\n\nIt takes a lot of courage to disappoint people.\n\nTo not be everything to everyone.\n\nBut it\u2019s non-negotiable if we want to be truly free \u2014 free to focus on what\nmatters most, to excellently do a few important things instead of many half-\nhearted ones, and to chart our own unique path.\n\nEvery so often, take an inventory. Look at where your time and energy are\ngoing. Are they aligned with your true north, your deepest values and\naspirations? Or have you gotten off track, weighed down by a hundred small\nobligations you\u2019ve picked up along the way?\n\nDeciding what to shed is hard. To an extent, putting other people\u2019s needs\nbefore your own is part of being human. Total selfishness is not the goal.\n\nPart of the bargain we make through commitment is belonging to a family, a\nworkplace, or a society.\n\nAnd you shouldn\u2019t attempt to abandon that.\n\nWe\u2019ve evolved to belong.\n\nBut we can\u2019t belong to everyone, everywhere, all at once.\n\nIf we don\u2019t periodically pause and reassess, the balance can tip too far. We\ncan wake up one day and realize we\u2019ve lost ourselves and our way, becoming\nprisoners of our own overcommitment and people-pleasing.\n\nTake an inventory. Decide what to keep and what to let go. Remove a few links\nfrom those invisible chains. Free yourself to fly higher, shine brighter, and\nbe more fully you.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling shackled and weary, try it.\n\nAudit your obligations.\n\nBe brave enough to drop the ones that are holding you back.\n\nThen celebrate that new lightness of being, that reclaimed slice of freedom.\nAnd remember this: happiness isn\u2019t having no ties, it\u2019s choosing your knots\nwith intention.\n\n#DIY eBook\n\n$9.99\n\n#DIY is about doing what you want and doing it your way.
