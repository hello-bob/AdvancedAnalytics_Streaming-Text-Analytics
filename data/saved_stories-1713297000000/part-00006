A comprehensive\nanalysis shows that the area may have shifted from a sink to a source of\ngreenhouse gases, bringing a longtime prediction to fruition.\n\nby Saima May Sidik 15 April 202415 April 2024\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Click to print (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n\nCredit: Justine Ramage\n\n## This newsletter rocks.\n\nGet the most fascinating science news stories of the week in your inbox every\nFriday.\n\nSign up now\n\n#####\n\nSource: Global Biogeochemical Cycles\n\nPermafrost underlies about 14 million square kilometers of land in and around\nthe Arctic. The top 3 meters contain an estimated 1 trillion metric tons of\ncarbon and 55 billion metric tons of nitrogen. Historically, the northern\npermafrost region has been a sink for carbon, as frozen soils inhibit\nmicrobial decomposition. But rising temperatures contribute to thawing\npermafrost and enhance the biogeochemical activities that exacerbate climate\nchange by releasing greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO_2), methane\n(CH_4), and nitrous oxide (N_2O).\n\nData on how much this region will\u2014or already has\u2014affected the course of\nclimate change are difficult to gather due to the complexity of the landscape.\nRamage et al. synthesized greenhouse gas measurements of the northern\npermafrost region between 2000 and 2020 to provide a carbon balance for the\nregion, as well as the first comprehensive assessment of the quantities of\ngreenhouse gases the area takes up and emits. The researchers\u2019 work, done as\npart of the Regional Carbon Cycle Assessment and Processes (RECCAP2) project,\nused a bottom-up approach, focusing on estimating emissions based on specific\nsource categories. Their results suggest that the area has already shifted\nfrom a sink to a small source of carbon.\n\nThe researchers compiled many past estimates of greenhouse gas flux in various\nsections of the northern permafrost region to reveal how the entire area is\nresponding to climate change. They found that the study area was a net source\nof CH_4 and N_2O between 2000 and 2020. Wetlands were some of the largest\nmethane emitters, and lakes contributed substantially as well. Dry tundra was\nthe biggest driver of N_2O release, and permafrost bogs were a close second.\n\nHowever, the researchers were unable to say definitively whether the region\nwas a net source or sink of CO_2. Terrestrial ecosystems, particularly boreal\nforests, still take up CO_2. But this is offset by fires, abrupt permafrost\nthaw, and inland waters, which emitted an estimated 12 million metric tons of\nCO_2.\n\nThe researchers estimate that the northern permafrost region emitted 38\nmillion metric tons of CH_4 and 670,000 metric tons of N_2O into the\natmosphere between 2000 and 2020. When accounting for lateral fluxes such as\nerosion, the region was also a source of 144 million metric tons of carbon and\n3 million metric tons of nitrogen. That\u2019s very little compared with the\nemissions of a major industrialized country, but the pace may accelerate as\nthe world warms.
