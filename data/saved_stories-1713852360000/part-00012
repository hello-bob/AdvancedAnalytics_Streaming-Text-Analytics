Arithmetic circuits contribute a major component of total\n> chip power consumption and are therefore a common target for power\n> optimization. While arithmetic circuit area and dynamic power consumption\n> are often correlated, there is also a tradeoff to consider, as additional\n> gates can be added to explicitly reduce arithmetic circuit activity and\n> hence reduce power consumption. In this work, we consider two forms of power\n> optimization and their interaction: circuit area reduction via arithmetic\n> optimization, and the elimination of redundant computations using both data\n> and clock gating. By encoding both these classes of optimization as local\n> rewrites of expressions, our tool flow can simultaneously explore them,\n> uncovering new opportunities for power saving through arithmetic rewrites\n> using the e-graph data structure. Since power consumption is highly\n> dependent upon the workload performed by the circuit, our tool flow\n> facilitates a data dependent design paradigm, where an implementation is\n> automatically tailored to particular contexts of data activity. We develop\n> an automated RTL to RTL optimization framework, ROVER, that takes circuit\n> input stimuli and generates power-efficient architectures. We evaluate the\n> effectiveness on both open-source arithmetic benchmarks and benchmarks\n> derived from Intel production examples. The tool is able to reduce the total\n> power consumption by up to 33.9%.\n\nSubjects:| Hardware Architecture (cs.AR)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.12336 [cs.AR]  \n(or arXiv:2404.12336v1 [cs.AR] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.12336arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Samuel Coward [view email] [v1] Thu, 18 Apr 2024 17:04:20 UTC (81 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Combining Power and Arithmetic Optimization via\nDatapath Rewriting, by Samuel Coward and 3 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.AR\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
