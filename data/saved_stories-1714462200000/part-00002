Photo: Aalto\nUniversity / Artur Kopitca.\n\nResearchers have developed a technique to move objects around with a jet of\nwind. The new approach makes it possible to manipulate objects at a distance\nand could be integrated into robots to give machines ethereal fingers.\n\n\u2018Airflow or wind is everywhere in our living environment, moving around\nobjects like pollen, pathogens, droplets, seeds and leaves. Wind has also been\nactively used in industry and in our everyday lives \u2013 for example, in leaf\nblowers to clean leaves. But so far, we can\u2019t control the direction the leaves\nmove \u2013 we can only blow them together into a pile,\u2019 says Professor Quan Zhou\nfrom Aalto University, who led the study.\n\nThe first step in manipulating objects with wind is understanding how objects\nmove in the airflow. To that end, a research team at Aalto University recorded\nthousands of sample movements in an artificially generated airflow and used\nthese to build templates of how objects move on a surface in a jet of air.\n\nThe team\u2019s analysis showed that even though the airflow is generally chaotic,\nit\u2019s still regular enough to move objects in a controlled way in different\ndirections \u2013 even back towards the nozzle blowing out the air.\n\n\u2018We designed an algorithm that controls the direction of the air nozzle with\ntwo motors. The jet of air is blown onto the surface from several meters away\nand to the side of the object, so the generated airflow field moves the object\nin the desired direction. The control algorithm repeatedly adjusts the\ndirection of the air nozzle so that the airflow moves the objects along the\ndesired trajectory,\u2019 explains Zhou.\n\n\u2018Our observations allowed us to use airflow to move objects along different\npaths, like circles or even complex letter-like paths. Our method is versatile\nin terms of the object\u2019s shape and material \u2013 we can control the movement of\nobjects of almost any shape,\u2019 he continues.\n\n## We care about your privacy.\n\nYou have not yet given permission to place the required cookies for Panopto\nvideos.

It could be\nused to collect items that are scattered on a surface, such as pushing debris\nand waste to collection points. It could also be useful in complex processing\ntasks where physical contact is impossible, such as handling electrical\ncircuits.\n\n\u2018We believe that this technique could get even better with a deeper\nunderstanding of the characteristics of the airflow field, which is what we\u2019re\nworking on next,\u2019 says Zhou.\n\nThe article was published in Advanced Intelligent Systems.

They promise the annihilation of distance but obstruct\n> pedestrian mobility, thus playing a key role in limiting social interactions\n> locally. Although this limiting role is widely acknowledged in urban\n> studies, the quantitative relationship between urban highways and social\n> ties is barely tested. Here we define a Barrier Score that relates massive,\n> geolocated online social network data to highways in the 50 largest US\n> cities.

For example one can run multituide of downloads with\nstd.net.curl with fibers, no blocking - it is as fast as threads but using\nless resources. Think of it as Golang style concurrency that is brought to D\ntransparently.\n\nJust like its particle cousing, Photon\u2019s nature is dual, seeking to unify 2\ndifferent concepts (such as async and blocking I/O) in many ways: Fibers and\nThreads can be mixed and matched in coherent way. LibC syscall wrapper is\noverriden to be aware of D fiber scheduling and transparently uses the same\neventloop if called on fiber and is passed through otherwise.\n\nExplicit async model with tasks/futures could be integrated with\npseudoblocking fiber scheduling, D Ranges with asynchronous event streams are\na natural extension looking forward.\n\n## Building\n\nPhoton switched to using Dub for D targets. The usual dub build should work.\nSee more about DUB\n\n## Usage\n\nTypically the photon-powered program looks like this:\n\n    \n    \n    #!/usr/bin/env dub /+ dub.json: { \"name\" : \"photon-example\", \"dependencies\": { \"photon\": \"0.8.0\" } } +/ import photon; void main() { startloop(); // start the event loop thread and initializes Photon's data structures go({ // the root fiber task goes here, typically this is accepting or connecting sockets, // spawning new fibers each to handle new connections. }); runFibers(); // run all fibers on the scheduler, until all are completed }\n\nSee more examples testing specific APIs here.\n\n## Blocking, async and pseudo-blocking\n\nIn short, there are roughly 3 ways (glossing over OS specific abilities) to\ntackle I/O.\n\n  1. Synchronous (blocking) I/O, where a kernel will block a thread and wake it up once the resource is available. This has the advantage of simple programming model at the expense of hogging a precious OS resource - threads, in addition to an expensive round-trip through the OS kernel to perform a context switch.\n\n  2. Explicit asynchronous (async) I/O. Typically involves passing a callback that is triggered on completion. More convenient model builds an algebra of Promise/Future objects on top of callbacks, such objects are then manipulated in a functional way. Lastly async/await extensions to some languages rewrite away the error-prone callback code via code transformation. Scalability comes from the fact that the thread continues on with its work after registering callback, so a single thread may process a multitude of sockets at the same time.\n\n  3. Pseudosynchronous (pseudoblocking) I/O, this is built on the green thread (Fiber in D) concept. First it makes fibers cheap, typically by allocating a modest stack size and/or growing it on demand. Secondly the runtime of the language (or the library) takes the burden of the context switch thus making it cheap to go from one green thread to the other. The moment a fiber wants to do a synchronous I/O the runtime will instead do async I/O and transparently switch context to another fiber.\n\nThere are oversimplifications in the above introductions. In particular on\nLinux AIO (Asynchronous I/O) is a separate thing from non-blocking I/O and\ntypically event-loops that implement schemes 2 & 3 noted above would use non-\nblocking I/O + kernel event system. More on that below.\n\nGo language would be a remarkably popular example of 3rd option - Goroutines\nare green threads that get scheduled (mapped) to a handful of OS threads in\nthe language runtime.\n\nC# and Dart would be an examples of 2nd option - language extension to tackle\nexplicit asynchronous I/O (and not only I/O). Many other languages follow\nsuit.\n\nCurrent situation with I/O in DLang looks roughly like the following diagram.\nDue to D's ability to call into arbitrary C libraries we have the full Zoo of\noptions without any of the benefits. To be specific we have normal synchronous\nI/O in std library (std.socket etc.), fiber-based I/O scheduling as an opt-in\nlibrary, sometimes explicit async I/O of kind in 3rd party C libraries and\nsynchronous I/O in the general mass of C libraries.\n\nThe landscape is naturally a wild west, see below\n\nSpecifically note the points of interaction 1-4:\n\n  1. Fiber-aware D library talks to vibe.d via special wrappers of most socket operations, this is pseudoblocking model. Note that a library has to depend on vibe.d to benefit + user has to run vibe.d scheduler for it to work.\n  2. Some 3-rd party library (typically C) provides callback-driven asynchronous API and talks to its own choice of event library/direct syscalls. This still allows a fiber to wait on it without blocking the thread but requires a bit of \"interconnect\" code.\n  3. D library may call some libc primitive that does synchronous I/O call, notably hostname resolution in libc is like that. It breaks fiber-aware pseudoblocking model and there is no static checking against it.\n  4. Finally most 3rd party C client libraries do synchronous I/O calls with the same caveats.\n\nWhat's important to understand is that all of the above can be mixed and\nmatched (and in fact inevitably will, if we are not careful). To underline the\nproblem:\n\n  * explicit async mixes well with explicit async of the same flavor, badly with any other model. But at least it's an explicit problem that can be solved on per use case basis.\n  * pseudoblocking only works if everything is following pseudoblocking model, also explicit async can integrate passably well, any single blocking primitive rapidly degrades pseudoblocking model\n  * finally blocking I/O is bane of all, it trivially spills through into any other model code with disastrous consequences\n\nThe end result is a brittle ecosystem where even if you have a 3rd party\n\"driver\" for your database it is likely not compatible with your I/O scheme,\nand the most widely compatible scheme (blocking I/O) is not scalable. Some\nlibraries have 2 versions - one on top of vibe.d sockets and the other on top\nof std.socket.\n\n## Solution\n\nThis project is going for a bold approach to solve this problem once and for\nall:\n\n  1. Replacing the libc syscall wrapper so that any blocking call relying on it (which is next to all) is transparently rewired to go through pseudoblocking runtime. All 3rd party libraries do fiber-aware pseudoblocking I/O automatically.\n  2. The rest of the libraries that do explicit async I/O stay as their are, their syscall are passed through. In the future we will intercept them as well to re-route to our eventloop, basically emulating the likes of select, poll and epoll in user-space by reusing the same event cache.\n  3. Finally vibe.d may produce a thin-shelled version that forward all of calls to blocking I/O to reuse our scheduler.\n\nNote: the approach of overriding underlying libc facilities is not something\nnew or uncalled for, e.g. jemalloc does it fitfully to replace default libc\nmemory allocator.\n\n## About\n\nPhoton - an experimental transparent Fiber scheduler and event-loop for DLang\n\n### Topics\n\nperformance concurrency fibers dlang\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nBSL-1.0 license\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n30 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n6 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n3 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\n13 tags\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n  * D 97.5%\n  * Other 2.5%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}

The university administration, its hand forced by the\nfaculty, has made repeated announcements that it no longer plans to evacuate\nthe protest encampment like other colleges have done. The NYPD buses that\nwaited nearby for a week gave up on giving the trespassing students a ride to\nthe precinct.\n\nThis means that at best, the negotiations will stay at an impasse. The\noccupation of South-West Lawn by the encampment is now a fixture of campus. It\nis the new normal.\n\nFor most Israeli and Jewish faculty, students, and staff, this self-ruling\nenclave, at the very center of campus is practically out of bounds. Upholding\nit relies on the high visibility and hands-on participation of an extreme\nminority of faculty members, some of whom physically stand guard at the\nencampment entrance.\n\nMore importantly, it leans on the more distant support of a super-majority of\nthe faculty, as evidenced by an 80% vote in the University Senate rebuking\nPresident Shafik and her administration for countering the most egregious\nviolations of protest policy by recruiting outside help in activities beyond\nthe capability and authority of campus Public Safety Officers.\n\nThese included external investigators who were able to quickly identify the\ntherefore-suspended students responsible for a \u201cResistance 101\u201d event,\nfeaturing explicit support for violence to the level of hijacking airplanes.\n\nStudents at Columbia University paint a response to a message written by\nPalestinians in Rafah thanking students for their support as they continue to\nmaintain a protest encampment on campus in support of Palestinians, during the\nwar between Israel and Hamas, April 28, 2024. (credit: REUTERS/CAITLIN OCHS)\n\nMore famously, the President called in NYPD to disperse the first invasion of\nstudents onto South Lawn within 36 hours. She rarely gets credit for the\ntactical importance of this swift action: evacuation was peaceful and non-\nviolent, which is unlikely for the current encampment, as protestors used the\ntime for organized military-style, platoon-wise drilling of stances and\nformations that would ensure an uglier altercation next time around.\n\n### Where do we go from here?\n\nWhere do we go from here? This selective rejection of enforcement of the rules\ncreates a constantly hostile environment for learning and working. In legal\nterms, Columbia is in continuous violation of Title 6 of the Civil Rights Act,\nwith the overwhelming support of its faculty. If we, Columbia, lose lawsuits\nor lose federal funding over this, we will have earned it, having stepped\nright into the trap set by outside bad-faith actors who would love to put our\nheads on a spike, especially in an election year.\n\nWhat is Outbrain\n\nThe institution\u2019s downfall will be hard. Not only will research vanish without\ngrants, leading to a mass departure of anyone who can, but also student\nfinancial aid that is so critical to many who couldn't otherwise afford the\nbargain price of our degrees, 3 for a cool million.\n\nIn the best-case scenario, we somehow survive this storm as an institution\nwithout a decades-long recession. In such a case we, Jewish and Israeli\nmembers of the Columbia community, face a similarly long period of 2nd-class\ncitizenship.\n\nThis is important to brace for, but tough to stomach, because this institution\nis a community. A faculty signatory of the primary letter supporting\nunenforced violations had once escorted my child to the hospital. The\nencampment includes students who grew up with my children.\n\nMany other institutions solicit an exodus of such Jewish and Israeli faculty\nand students. I know good scholars who have started thinking about it\nseriously. But why should I leave? The bad guys should leave! In the meantime,\nwe should have a stiff upper lip as we fight the hostilities. My finger is\nalready blistered from the \u201csubmit\u201d button for Title 6 complaints, but I have\n9 more.\n\nFinally, I should address my fellow professors. They label me as 1st-Gen to\ncollege, but Israelis and Jews know that I am 2nd-Gen, as the family\neducational history that matters here is where my father went at age 14\ninstead of high school - a sleepaway camp called Auschwitz.\n\nWhere Vietnam-era boomers see the reflection of 1968 in today\u2019s protests, I\nsee the shadows of 1938. You may or may not like birds, but you love oxygen,\nand we\u2019re the canary in your coal mine. At this stage of the reign of terror,\nyou too are among the victims, as I know university senators who were afraid\nto speak due to the mob mentality.\n\nYes, call the cops yesterday, or tomorrow they will come without asking you,\nand next week the National Guard. Last time we had to call the Red Army.\n\nItsik Pe'er is a Professor and Vice Chair at the Department of Computer\nScience at the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science at\nColumbia University, and a Professor of Systems Biology at the Vagelos College\nof Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University.\n\nRelated Tagsnew york citycolumbiaNYPDCampus AntisemitismIvy League\n\nTake Israel home with the new Jerusalem Post Store\n\nShop now >>\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\nWhat is Outbrain\n\nWhat is Outbrain\n\nHot Opinion\n\n### US support for Israel remains crucial as President Biden meets with\nreleased hostage\n\nBy JPOST EDITORIAL\n\n### A rabbinical message: Islam must recognize Israel\n\nBy OURY CHERKI\n\n### America's critics of Israel: Not just wokeness and antisemitism\n\nBy DAN PERRY\n\n### Israel is not responsible for Hamas\u2019s evil\n\nBy URI PILICHOWSKI\n\n### US Rep.
