WASP-43 b is a Jupiter-sized planet roughly 280 light-years away,\nin the constellation Sextans. The planet orbits its star at a distance of\nabout 1.3 million miles, completing one circuit in about 19.5 hours. Because\nit is so close to its star, WASP-43 b is probably tidally locked: Its rotation\nrate and orbital period are the same, such that one side faces the star at all\ntimes.\n\nview more\n\nCredit: Credits: NASA, ESA, CSA, Ralf Crawford (STScI)\n\nAn international team of researchers has successfully used NASA\u2019s James Webb\nSpace Telescope to map the weather on the hot gas-giant exoplanet WASP-43 b.\n\nPrecise brightness measurements over a broad spectrum of mid-infrared light,\ncombined with 3D climate models and previous observations from other\ntelescopes, suggest the presence of thick, high clouds covering the nightside,\nclear skies on the dayside, and equatorial winds upwards of 5,000 miles per\nhour mixing atmospheric gases around the planet.\n\nThe investigation is just the latest demonstration of the exoplanet science\nnow possible with Webb\u2019s extraordinary ability to measure temperature\nvariations and detect atmospheric gases trillions of miles away.\n\n## Tidally Locked \u201cHot Jupiter\u201d\n\nWASP-43 b is a \u201chot Jupiter\u201d type of exoplanet: similar in size to Jupiter,\nmade primarily of hydrogen and helium, and much hotter than any of the giant\nplanets in our own solar system. Although its star is smaller and cooler than\nthe Sun, WASP-43 b orbits at a distance of just 1.3 million miles \u2013 less than\n1/25^th the distance between Mercury and the Sun.\n\nWith such a tight orbit, the planet is tidally locked, with one side\ncontinuously illuminated and the other in permanent darkness. Although the\nnightside never receives any direct radiation from the star, strong eastward\nwinds transport heat around from the dayside.\n\nSince its discovery in 2011, WASP-43 b has been observed with numerous\ntelescopes, including NASA\u2019s Hubble and now-retired Spitzer space telescopes.\n\n\u201cWith Hubble, we could clearly see that there is water vapor on the dayside.\nBoth Hubble and Spitzer suggested there might be clouds on the nightside,\u201d\nexplained Taylor Bell, researcher from the Bay Area Environmental Research\nInstitute and lead author of a study published today in Nature Astronomy. \u201cBut\nwe needed more precise measurements from Webb to really begin mapping the\ntemperature, cloud cover, winds, and more detailed atmospheric composition all\nthe way around the planet.\u201d\n\n## Mapping Temperature and Inferring Weather\n\nAlthough WASP-43 b is too small, dim, and close to its star for a telescope to\nsee directly, its short orbital period of just 19.5 hours makes it ideal for\nphase curve spectroscopy, a technique that involves measuring tiny changes in\nbrightness of the star-planet system as the planet orbits the star.\n\nSince the amount of mid-infrared light given off by an object depends largely\non how hot it is, the brightness data captured by Webb can then be used to\ncalculate the planet\u2019s temperature.\n\nThe team used Webb\u2019s MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument) to measure light from the\nWASP-43 system every 10 seconds for more than 24 hours. \u201cBy observing over an\nentire orbit, we were able to calculate the temperature of different sides of\nthe planet as they rotate into view,\u201d explained Bell. \u201cFrom that, we could\nconstruct a rough map of temperature across the planet.\u201d\n\nThe measurements show that the dayside has an average temperature of nearly\n2,300 degrees Fahrenheit (1,250 degrees Celsius) \u2013 hot enough to forge iron.\nMeanwhile, the nightside is significantly cooler at 1,100 degrees Fahrenheit\n(600 degrees Celsius). The data also helps locate the hottest spot on the\nplanet (the \u201chotspot\u201d), which is shifted slightly eastward from the point that\nreceives the most stellar radiation, where the star is highest in the planet\u2019s\nsky. This shift occurs because of supersonic winds, which move heated air\neastward.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we can map temperature in this way is a real testament to\nWebb\u2019s sensitivity and stability,\u201d said Michael Roman, a co-author from the\nUniversity of Leicester in the U.K.\n\nTo interpret the map, the team used complex 3D atmospheric models like those\nused to understand weather and climate on Earth. The analysis shows that the\nnightside is probably covered in a thick, high layer of clouds that prevent\nsome of the infrared light from escaping to space. As a result, the nightside\n\u2013 while very hot \u2013 looks dimmer and cooler than it would if there were no\nclouds.\n\n## Missing Methane and High Winds\n\nThe broad spectrum of mid-infrared light captured by Webb also made it\npossible to measure the amount of water vapor (H_2O) and methane (CH_4) around\nthe planet. \u201cWebb has given us an opportunity to figure out exactly which\nmolecules we\u2019re seeing and put some limits on the abundances,\u201d said Joanna\nBarstow, a co-author from the Open University in the U.K.\n\nThe spectra show clear signs of water vapor on the nightside as well as the\ndayside of the planet, providing additional information about how thick the\nclouds are and how high they extend in the atmosphere.\n\nSurprisingly, the data also shows a distinct lack of methane anywhere in the\natmosphere. Although the dayside is too hot for methane to exist (most of the\ncarbon should be in the form of carbon monoxide), methane should be stable and\ndetectable on the cooler nightside.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we don't see methane tells us that WASP-43b must have wind\nspeeds reaching something like 5,000 miles per hour,\u201d explained Barstow. \u201cIf\nwinds move gas around from the dayside to the nightside and back again fast\nenough, there isn\u2019t enough time for the expected chemical reactions to produce\ndetectable amounts of methane on the nightside.\u201d\n\nThe team thinks that because of this wind-driven mixing, the atmospheric\nchemistry is the same all the way around the planet, which wasn\u2019t apparent\nfrom past work with Hubble and Spitzer.\n\nThe MIRI observation of WASP-43 b was conducted as part of the Webb Early\nRelease Science programs, which are providing researchers with a vast set of\nrobust, open-access data for studying a wide array of cosmic phenomena.The\nJames Webb Space Telescope is the world's premier space science observatory.\nWebb is solving mysteries in our solar system, looking beyond to distant\nworlds around other stars, and probing the mysterious structures and origins\nof our universe and our place in it. Webb is an international program led by\nNASA with its partners, ESA (European Space Agency) and the Canadian Space\nAgency.\n\n#### Journal\n\nNature Astronomy\n\n#### DOI\n\n10.1038/s41550-024-02230-x\n\n#### Article Title\n\nNightside clouds and disequilibrium chemistry on the hot Jupiter WASP-43b\n\n#### Article Publication Date\n\n30-Apr-2024\n\nDisclaimer: AAAS and EurekAlert! are not responsible for the accuracy of news\nreleases posted to EurekAlert! by contributing institutions or for the use of\nany information through the EurekAlert system.\n\nMedia Contacts\n\nLaura Betz NASA Goddard laura.e.betz@nasa.gov\n\nChristine Pulliam STSCI cpulliam@stsci.edu\n\n### More on this News Release\n\n### NASA\u2019s Webb maps weather on planet 280 light-years away\n\nNASA/Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nJournal\n\n    Nature Astronomy\nDOI\n\n    10.1038/s41550-024-02230-x\n\n#### Keywords\n\n#### Additional Multimedia\n\nImage: Hot Gas-Giant Exoplanet WASP-43 b (MIRI Phase Curve)\n\nImage: Hot Gas-Giant Exoplanet WASP-43 b (Temperature Maps)\n\n#### Original Source\n\nhttps://science.nasa.gov/missions/webb/nasas-webb-maps-weather-on-\nplanet-280-light-years-away/\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 by the American Association for the Advancement of Science\n(AAAS)\n\n  * facebook.com/EurekAlert\n  * @EurekAlert\n  * youtube.com/EurekAlert\n\n  * Help / FAQ\n  * Services\n  * Eligibility Guidelines\n  * Contact EurekAlert!\n\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * DMCA\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Disclaimer\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 by the American Association for the Advancement of Science\n(AAAS)\n\n", "frontpage": false}
