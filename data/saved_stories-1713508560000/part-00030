DOI:\n10.1038/s41467-024-47040-x\n\nUniversity of Queensland researchers have built a generator that absorbs\ncarbon dioxide (CO_2) to make electricity.\n\nDr. Zhuyuan Wang from UQ's Dow Center for Sustainable Engineering Innovation\nsays the small, proof-of-concept nanogenerator is carbon negative because it\nconsumes the greenhouse gas. The paper is published in the journal Nature\nCommunications.\n\n\"This nanogenerator is made of two components: a polyamine gel that is already\nused by industry to absorb CO_2 and a skeleton a few atoms thick of boron\nnitrate that generates positive and negative ions,\" Dr. Wang said.\n\n\"We've worked out how to make the positive ions much larger than the negative\nions and because the different sizes move at different speeds, they generate a\ndiffusion current which can be amplified into electricity to power light bulbs\nor any electronic device.\n\n\"In nature and in the human body, ion transportation is the most efficient\nenergy conversion\u2014more efficient than electron transportation which is used in\nthe power network.\"\n\nThe two components were embedded in a hydrogel which is 90% water, cut into\n4-centimeter disks and small rectangles and then tested in a sealed box pumped\nfull of CO_2.\n\nCredit: University of Queensland\n\n\"When we saw electrical signals coming out, I was very excited but worried I'd\nmade a mistake,\" Dr. Wang said.\n\n\"I double-checked everything, and it was working correctly so I started\ndreaming about changing the world using this technology.\n\n\"This technology goes further than being carbon neutral\u2014it consumes CO_2 as it\ngenerates energy.\n\n\"At present we can harvest around 1% of the total energy carried intrinsically\nby gas CO_2 but like other technologies, we will now work on improving\nefficiency and reducing cost.\"\n\nDirector of the Dow Center, Professor Xiwang Zhang, said following the success\nof the laboratory tests, there are two potential applications for the\nnanogenerator in the future.\n\n\"We could make a slightly bigger device that is portable to generate\nelectricity to power a mobile phone or a laptop computer using CO_2 from the\natmosphere,\" Professor Zhang said.\n\n\"A second application on a much larger scale, would integrate this technology\nwith an industrial CO_2 capture process to harvest electricity.\"\n\nThe UQ-developed technology absorbs carbon dioxide and generates electricity.\nCredit: University of Queensland\n\n\u00d7 close\n\nThe UQ-developed technology absorbs carbon dioxide and generates electricity.\nCredit: University of Queensland\n\nThe development of the nanogenerator will continue through GETCO2, the ARC\nCenter of Excellence for Green Electrochemical Transformation of Carbon\nDioxide which is led by UQ's School of Chemical Engineering with Professor\nZhang as Director.\n\n\"We want to realize the value in a problematic greenhouse gas and to change\nthe perception of CO_2,\" Professor Zhang said.\n\n\"Until now CO_2 has been seen as a problem to be solved but it can be a\nresource for the future.\"\n\nMore information: Zhuyuan Wang et al, Electricity generation from carbon\ndioxide adsorption by spatially nanoconfined ion separation, Nature\nCommunications (2024).
