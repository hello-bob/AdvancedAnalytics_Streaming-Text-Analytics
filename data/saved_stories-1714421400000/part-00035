This material is mostly based off the excellent online textbook Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP), with pointers to the relevant chapters of the textbook provided against each lecture. A brief video lecture introduces the concepts from the textbook, and students are strongly encouraged to read the book chapters (that are freely available online) for a more in-depth understanding of the concepts.\n  * Part X (lectures 21-32) contains an in-depth discussion of OS concepts using the xv6 operating system as an example. The xv6 teaching operating system comes with concise source code and a textbook/commentary, and is a great resource to understand fundamental concepts using a simple OS. Here are links to the PDF formatted xv6 source code and the accompanying xv6 book for the latest x86 version of xv6 that is used in the lectures.\n  * Part N (lectures 33-35) provides an overview of the networking subsystem in Linux, and some recent advances in the area of improving network I/O performance.\n\nRecommended usage: Students and instructors are free to use this material for\nacademic purposes. There are two broad ways to navigate through the video\nlectures. One can cover the basic concept video lectures based on OSTEP\n(lectures 1-20) first, followed by a deeper dive into operating systems using\nxv6 (lectures 21-32). It is also possible to do the basics and xv6 parts\ntogether (studying one concept in OSTEP and following it up with understanding\nthe same concept in xv6) by viewing the lectures in this order: Processes (1,\n21, 2, 22, 3, 23, 4, 24-26, 5-6), Memory management (7-11, 27-28), Concurrency\n(12-16, 29-30), and Filesystems (17-20, 31-32).Related video courses: Links to\nother related courses for which I have made lecture videos available:\n\n  * Virtualization and Cloud Computing\n  * Design and Engineering of Computer Systems\n\nOther textbooks: Besides OSTEP, the following online/physical textbooks give a\ngood end-to-end understanding of computer systems.\n\n  * Dive into Systems, by Suzanne J. Matthews, Tia Newhall, and Kevin C. Webb.\n  * Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, by Randal E. Bryant and David R. O'Hallaron.\n\nCredits: Thanks to the OSTEP textbook authors for allowing me to use material\nfrom their book in my slides. Thanks also to the xv6 authors for making the\nxv6 OS available for teaching. Thanks to my TAs over the years who have helped\nme come up with the various labs and videos.Feedback: If you have found the\nmaterial useful, or have suggestions on how it can be improved, I will be\nhappy to hear from you.
