The Product Owner\ntypically takes charge of writing user stories.\n\n##\n\nStage 2: Strict Process Following\n\nAs the team progresses, a more rigid structure emerges. Only the Product Owner\ndrafts user stories, with team members pointing out missing elements.\n\n##\n\nStage 3: Ownership\n\nAs the team matures, it adopts a collaborative approach. If there's a shared\nunderstanding after a discussion, anyone in the team can contribute to\ncrafting user stories.\n\nIn a mature Stage 3 team, it's not uncommon for user stories to appear in a\nsprint that the Product Owner hasn't seen before. This is a positive\ndevelopment, indicating that team members take ownership of the product. Tasks\nmay emerge during the sprint, reflecting the team's ability to adapt to new\ninformation or split stories themselves, e.g. when experiments have been run\nduring a sprint.\n\nGet the next issue straight to your inbox! \u2b07\ufe0f\n\nThis shift in responsibility is beneficial. It allows the Product Owner to\nconcentrate on strategy, experimentation and discovery, contributing to the\noverall success of the product. It shows that the while team cares about the\nproduct and understand the product goal.\n\nIn conclusion, the evolution from strict process adherence to collaborative\nownership marks a team's growth. Encouraging every team member to contribute\nto user story creation fosters a sense of shared responsibility, ultimately\nbenefiting the product's trajectory. As software product managers and\nengineers, let's embrace this shift and leverage the collective expertise\nwithin our teams for continued success.\n\nSubscribe to Leading in Product to vote on this poll\n\nOnly subscribers can vote on this poll.\n\nAlready a subscriber?
