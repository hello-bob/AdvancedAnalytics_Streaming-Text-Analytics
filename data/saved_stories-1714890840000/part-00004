The group\u2019s findings and genome-\nreconstruction techniques are outlined in a paper published Thursday in\nScience.\n\nAn expert in biomolecular archaeology, Warinner has pioneered the study of\nancient tooth tartar, the only part of the human body that fossilizes during\nlife. A form of calcified dental plaque, tartar contains the same minerals as\nthe human skeleton, with similar survival potential for archaeological\ndiscovery. \u201cAnd because it\u2019s on a person\u2019s teeth, we can very clearly\nassociate it with that person and their life,\u201d Warinner said.\n\nStill, scraping ancient teeth \u2014 \u201cWe use the same tools as in a dentist\u2019s\noffice \u2014 you can call us very belated dental hygienists,\u201d Warinner said \u2014\nyields only fragments of highly degraded genetic material. \u201cA typical\nbacterial genome is 3 million base pairs long, but time fragments the ancient\nDNA we recover to an average length of only about 30 to 50 base pairs,\u201d\nWarinner explained. \u201cIn other words, each ancient bacterial genome is like a\n60,000-piece jigsaw puzzle, and each piece of tooth tartar contains millions\nof genomes.\u201d\n\nA form of calcified dental plaque, tartar contains the same minerals as the\nhuman skeleton, with similar survival potential for archaeological discovery,\npreserving DNA over millennia.\n\nUntil now, scientists have sought to understand these genetic scraps by\nmatching them with databases of reference genomes, always taken from present-\nday species. The technique has been used with success, Warinner noted, though\nlimitations were clear from the start. \u201cYou can never find new species or\npotentially extinct species that way,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause you\u2019re limited to\ncomparing it to something that is already known.\u201d\n\nAbout three years ago, Warinner and her team joined forces with experts in\nchemical and synthetic biology for a \u201cmoonshot\u201d project \u2014 to reconstruct the\ngenomes of Pleistocene-era bacteria and use the blueprints to revive their\nlong-lost bacterial metabolites, with hopes of one day discovering\nbiochemicals with therapeutic potential.\n\n## More like this\n\n  * Science & Tech\n\n### DNA shows poorly understood empire was multiethnic with strong female\nleadership\n\nApril 28, 2023 5 min read\n\n  * Science & Tech\n\n### Turns out developing a taste for carbs wasn\u2019t a bad thing\n\nMay 10, 2021 6 min read\n\n  * Science & Tech\n\n### Anthropologists dig into fossilized dental plaque for clues to ancient\ntrade\n\nMarch 22, 2021 5 min read\n\n  * Science & Tech\n\n### The archaeology of plaque (yes, plaque)\n\nNovember 19, 2019 9 min read\n\nFor this, the group received a grant from Switzerland-based Werner Siemens\nFoundation for the purpose of bolstering collaboration across the social and\nnatural sciences. \u201cWe originally set out with a goal of developing this\ntechnology within 10 years, but we have already reached our most important\nmilestone in three,\u201d said Warinner, who added that the pandemic spurred a\ncritical focus on computational problem-solving.\n\nThe researchers started with an existing genetic technique called de novo\nassembly, which allows a genome to be digitally pieced back together from\nsequenced DNA fragments. \u201cIt requires that you have a lot of data because you\nbasically overlap the fragments and try to build up the whole genome from\nthese pieces,\u201d said Warinner, who also holds the title of Sally Starling\nSeaver Associate Professor at the Radcliffe Institute. \u201cIt was thought this\nwould be impossible for ancient DNA because our fragments were simply too\nsmall and too damaged.\u201d\n\nWarinner and her co-authors systematically tested and optimized the technique\nuntil they reached a breakthrough on ultrashort DNA fragments. They applied de\nnovo assembly to DNA harvested from the dental tartar of 12 Neanderthals\n(dating from 40,000 to 102,000 years ago) and 34 humans (150 to 30,000 years\nold).\n\nThis allowed researchers to reconstruct several hundred distinct genomes, the\nmajority of which were found to be oral bacteria. \u201cIn addition to the usual\nsuspects, we were also able to reconstruct some genomes that weren\u2019t known\nbefore,\u201d Warinner said. \u201cSo, this has led to the discovery of new oral\nspecies.\u201d\n\nReconstructed genomes were of particularly high quality for two species of\nbacteria found in Pleistocene-era tartar. These genomes became the focus of\nfurther investigation because they contained a special sequence of genes \u2014\nknown as biosynthetic gene clusters \u2014 that encode enzymes capable of producing\na vast array of chemicals. \u201cThis is how bacteria make really complicated and\nuseful chemicals,\u201d Warinner explained. \u201cAlmost all of our antimicrobials and a\nlot of our drug treatments ultimately derive from such bacterial biosynthetic\ngene clusters.\u201d\n\nAfter reconstructing the gene sequences, the team synthesized and transferred\nthe genetic material into living bacteria, which proceeded to produce the\nbiochemicals encoded by the ancient genes. \u201cThis is a confirmation that our\nassemblies are correct,\u201d Warinner said, \u201cbecause if there were errors, it\nwould not have worked at all.\u201d\n\nNext up, the triumphant research team plans to use their technique to keep\nexploring the chemical diversity of the Pleistocene, with hopes of eventually\ndiscovering species that produce new therapeutic molecules \u2014 perhaps even an\nantibiotic. \u201cNow we can scale up this process,\u201d Warinner said. \u201cSuddenly, we\ncan massively expand our understanding of the biochemical past.\u201d\n\n#### Share this article\n\n  * Share on Facebook\n  * Share on LinkedIn\n  * Email article\n  * Print/PDF\n\n## You might like\n\n  * Science & Tech\n\n### Complex questions, innovative approaches\n\nSeven projects awarded Star-Friedman Challenge grants\n\n5 min read\n\n  * Science & Tech\n\n### Early warning sign of extinction?\n\nFossil record stretching millions of years shows tiny ocean creatures on the\nmove before Earth heats up\n\nPart of the Findings series\n\n3 min read\n\n  * Science & Tech\n\n### So much for summers of love\n\nDespite \u2018hippie\u2019 reputation, male bonobos fight three times as often as\nchimps, study finds\n\nPart of the Findings series\n\n3 min read\n\n## Trending\n\n  1.
