See more from Ascend here.\n\nI remember, quite vividly, the drive up to Boston University for my first year\nof college. My nerves, excitement, and fear had almost reached a boiling point\nas we passed through Connecticut. I imagined the person I would become in just\na few months: a scholar conducting research alongside his professors, a\nsocialite making lifelong connections, and a writer putting the final touches\non a manuscript that I had started the past year.\n\nLooking back, I can see that the future self I had so eagerly drawn up was\naspirational, but at the time, it gave me goals, and I thought achieving those\ngoals would make me into the person who I wanted to be.\n\nThat is, until I tried to live them out.\n\nAs the fall semester came to a close, I had checked a couple of items off my\nlist: I conducted some independent research and even made progress in writing\nthe novel.\n\nBut I was unhappy.\n\nIn my attempt to constantly do more, I stopped eating enough to maintain my\nhealth and lost forty pounds of muscle. On bad days, I\u2019d skip out on social\nevents, go to the gym, and run for miles and miles just to clear my head.\nDespite vigorously taking steps to morph into my future self, something was\nmissing. I just couldn\u2019t understand what it was. Since then, I\u2019ve come to\nrealize that the future self I had imagined was a toxic idol.\n\nIn the past few years, the concept of using visualization as tool to manifest\nthe dream version of our selves has come into vogue in both personal and\nprofessional development circles. It seems like anyone with a pulse is talking\nabout how to adopt a growth mindset and evolve, specifically as it relates to\ntheir roles, their qualities, or other dispositions about the self that they\nseek to fill or change.\n\nAdmittedly, I\u2019m somewhat guilty of doing this, but the idea of manifesting a\nfuture self defined entirely by our current visions of what a fulfilling life\nwould look like and what we imagine we must do to achieve it, as tempting as\nit may be, presents a pervasive philosophical and practical problem.\n\nThere\u2019s a sense that if only we are able to make the correct choices, network\nproperly, go to the right career fairs, find the right internships, and work\nfor the right number of hours, then and only then will we find some semblance\nof happiness. Ultimately, we boil down the search for happiness, personal and\nprofessional fulfillment, into a series of plug-and-play equations.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that we need to put in the work to grow and excel at any given\nthing, the matter of self-discovery and self-creation are much more nuanced\nthan that.\n\nFrom the standpoint of an analytical philosopher, the future self only exists\nby virtue of not existing yet. It is indeterminate and always in flux \u2014 and\nthis is at the heart of the problem. Those of us who hold a rigid and self-\ndefinitional vision of who we want to be, say 10 years down the line, may\nunknowingly be using the concept of our future self to understand who we are\nin the present, and this can be damaging.\n\nIf, for example, you tie your hopes and dreams to a certain goal \u2014 let\u2019s say\ngoing to a specific college or landing a competitive internship at your dream\nfirm \u2014 failing to fulfill these expectations disrupts the path you have deemed\nnecessary to becoming your future self and can cause you great distress. This\ndisruption of continuity then creates a gulf between your understanding of who\nyou think you should be and who you actually are.\n\nMore specifically, when you tether your sense of self to such specific goals,\nyou can unintentionally shut the door on a whole subset of possibilities or\npredispose yourself to not taking opportunities that might seem extraneous to\nyour goals, even though, in reality, they are foundational to achieving\nhappiness or professional prosperity.\n\nIn The Humanism of Existentialism, the French philosopher and existentialist\nJean-Paul Sartre argues that existential free choice is like a sort of\nartwork. Any piece of art is going to have different merits depending on its\ncontext and content. He writes, \u201cWe have to take things as they are. And\nmoreover, to say that we invent values means neither more nor less than this;\nthat there is no sense in life a priori. Life is nothing until it is lived;\nbut it is yours to make sense of, and the value of it is nothing else but the\nsense that you choose.\u201d\n\nWhat Sartre is essentially arguing is that the process of becoming our future\nself is an inventive one. The trouble with a self-definitional concept of the\nfuture self (one that we use to make sense of ourselves in the present) is\nthat it seeks to give a concrete basis, a mold to which we\u2019re meant to\nconform, but ultimately self-creation is artistic. We\u2019ve never done this\nbefore, and we should face it as a creative endeavor. We should not treat the\nformative years of our lives as some sterile exercise in game theory or cost-\nbenefit analysis.\n\nTo shift our mindsets, we first need to debunk the common belief that we are\njustified in our conceptions of future self, that our dreams or personal goals\nhave some a priori justification. I argue that this is not true, especially\nwhen considering self-definitional models of the future self. Our future\nselves are not aspirations, but metaphysical judgements that we impose \u2014\neither uncritically or unintentionally \u2014 to make sense of our own existence.\nThat is to say, our goals, roles, and aspirations are not simply \u201cgood\u201d or\n\u201cvaluable\u201d on their own. We must recognize that it is we, ourselves, who\nascribe value and justification to them, and not the other way around.\n\nOf course, changing our outlooks in this way is not easy. As Sartre notes, our\ntendency to seek a unification between our sense of self and our \u201cpurpose\u201d is\na natural instinct. We long for some Platonic essence, for the universe itself\nto bestow deep meaning unto ourselves and our actions, but find none because\nhumanity is ungrounded and \u201ccondemned to be free.\u201d In other words, any meaning\nwe choose to see is exactly that \u2014 a choice, and our own free choice at that.\n\nAt every given moment, we must choose how it is that we will relate to the\nworld around us and what we choose to do with our lives.\n\nAt the same time, that is not to say that there is no place for maintaining a\nconcept of future self at all. Research on creative self-expectations suggests\nthat in creative settings, or those in which we give ourselves the freedom to\nexplore and self-define, future self expectations may lead to a self-\nfulfilling prophecy effect, which can allow us to be more productive in\nachieving our goals.\n\nI believe that the answer, then, is to allow ourselves to recognize that our\nfuture selves are indeterminate. We must creatively (rather than methodically)\nwork towards their actualization. If we can do that, we can dream without\nconsequence.\n\nTo demonstrate this healthier way of thinking, let\u2019s return to our initial\nexample. Let\u2019s say you have your mind set on a dream school or internship, but\nyou find yourself staring at a pile of rejection letters. Instead of allowing\nthat challenge to disrupt your sense of self and make you feel like a complete\nfailure, you can try to accept and creatively make use of the experience.\nThink of it as a part of your story. There\u2019s no honest way to escape such a\nthing, but there is equally nothing stopping you from using it as motivation\nin your next endeavor. By weaving the experience into your self-understanding,\nyou remove it as an obstacle to reaching your future goals.\n\nThis is a rather fine line to walk, and might more aptly be described as a\ntightrope pressed against a razor\u2019s edge. The simplest, and possibly quickest,\nway to shift our mindsets might come from recognizing the human \u201cpositivity\nbias,\u201d or the disposition that we will generally be better in the future. We\ncan recognize this, understand it, and choose not to give into it. We can\nchoose to accept that whether or not we meet the expectations we inevitably\nset for our future selves, we have the power and free will to decide how we\nrelate to the art that our self has become in the present.\n\nNew!\n\nHBR Learning\n\nCareer Management Course\n\nAccelerate your career with Harvard ManageMentor\u00ae.
