The result was 22,454\ndrawings.\n\nScreenshot of the tracing interface\n\nWe set out with a singular focus; make the longest collaborative flipbook\nanimation ever. We ended up creating 25 different animations. The initial\nexperiment ran for the majority of the period, resulting in an eight-minute\nvideo composed of 5,760 drawings. Watch it below.\n\nThe longest collaborative flipbook animation\n\nThe second experiment involved creating a 30-second animation, repeated four\ntimes with the same starting image, to compare how they evolved. We did this\nfor six different starting images (24 total animations). You can scrub through\nframe-by-frame results below.\n\nStarting image:\n\n1\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more! We ran a secret experiment in an attempt to observe\nthe online disinhibition effect. Our theory: people would be more inclined to\ndraw inappropriate images (i.e., penises) with no personal information\nattached to their submissions. Why? Without fail, any free-form drawing\nproject on the internet yields phallic imagery. Despite our best algorithmic\nefforts to thwart these from surfacing, you will still notice two exemplary\nmoments if you watch the video above closely. We wanted to quantify this\ntendency.\n\nTo test the effect, people were asked to add their name for recognition or get\nnotified when the flipbook results were ready. We split the group in two; half\nwere prompted to draw a circle confirming they were a human before being asked\nfor their information (name, phone number, or email), the other half were\nprompted to draw after we had their info.\n\nThe results were...surprisingly mild. We had 5,899 participants; 3,308\nsubmitted a drawing before giving their information, and 2,591 after. The\nresults for both groups were similar. Our conclusion was that most likely the\nexperiment was flawed. Regardless of the order of the prompts, people knew\npersonal information was about to be collected. While the disinhibition effect\nwasn\u2019t significant, the lack of subversiveness in general was quite\nsurprising. Despite accepting all forms of drawing attempts, 99.2% of people\nstill adhered to the prompt by attempting a proper circle.\n\na selection of circles from the secret experiment\n\nOur small rebellious group yielded a meager four probable penises, some non-\ncircle geometric shapes, hearts, flowers, human figures, and various other\ndoodles.\n\na selection of non-circles from the secret experiment\n\nThat\u2019s all for the recap.
