Even\nthe most energy-efficient devices still need power to track and report GPS\ncoordinates, moisture levels, temperatures, soil acidity, nutrient\nconcentrations, and invading pests. And there are as many solutions as there\nare data to track: long-life batteries, solar panels, wind generators, laser\nand microwave energy beams, and even capacitor-laden drones that can settle\nover and charge buried induction coils.\n\nNow researchers at Tennessee Technological University in Cookeville have\nanother new idea: Sending electrical power directly through the soil. This\nisn\u2019t just a laboratory curiosity\u2014the researchers have transmitted electrical\npower through-the-soil (TTS) to power remote sensors and long-range, low-power\nLoRa radios distributed over a two-acre test plot through multiple growing\nseasons.\n\nThe engineers powered their tests with a mobile solar panel array, and\nrequired roughly 0.1 kWh per day. If they had paid retail rates for that\npower, it would have cost them just over a penny per day.\n\nThe TTS transmitter is a pair of electrodes, one on the surface and one sunk\n90 meters underground.Tennessee Tech University\n\nThe researchers\u2019 TTS system has three main components: A power transmitter,\none or more power receivers, and multiple sensor modules.\n\nThe group\u2019s two-acre test network linked four sensor packs. Each included a\nMicrochip microcontroller, a LoRa network integrated circuit, a 1 millifarad\ncapacitor that stored power for transmission bursts, and two soil sensors\u2014one\nfor moisture and one for temperature. Combined, the trial\u2019s four sensor\nmodules required 0.8 watts.\n\nThe TTS system\u2019s transmitter, however, drew more power. A series of\nimprovements lowered input-current demand from 500 W to 250 W. And because the\nsystem did not need to monitor sensor readings continuously, a duty cycle\nconsisted of 1 minute on and 59 minutes off, which brought daily power\nconsumption down to 0.1 kWh.\n\nThe TTS receiver has two 0.7 meter electrodes spaced 3 meters apart to pick up\ncurrent from the transmitter.Tennessee Tech University\n\nConceptually, the transmitter and multiple receivers form coupled circuits.\nPower goes deep into the ground at the transmitter, and receivers out in the\nfields draw it up as needed. \u201cThe geometry of the TTS system is similar to a\nwater well, offering a possible way to integrate this [long-range wireless\npower transfer] technique into existing farming infrastructure at very little\ncost to the user,\u201d the researchers wrote in a paper published in the February\n2024 issue of IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics.\n\nThe transmitter consists of a surface electrode and a bottom electrode. The\nsurface electrode is a 15-meter-long steel well-casing sunk into the top soil\nlayers. The bottom electrode threads through the casing to stretch 90 meters\nunderground, with 75 meters of heavy-gauge wire in a high-density polyethylene\ntube connected to another 15 meters of exposed brass.\n\nAt each receiver are two 0.7-meter-long rods driven into the ground 1 to 3\nmeters apart. The sensor module is wired between these electrodes. Voltage\ndepends on the distance from transmitter to receiver and the spacing between\nthe receiver electrodes. Operators can adjust receiver-electrode spacing to\ndeliver the voltage they need (in this case, 3.6 V) to run the sensor module.\n\nCharles Van Neste, an assistant professor at Tennessee Technological\nUniversity, and his colleagues started working on TTS power in 2016. Since\nthen, they\u2019ve studied the electrical properties of soil and learned how\ncurrent behaves underground, while also making efforts to expand the system\nover larger plots of land.\n\nDuring their work, the researchers have learned that while soil is generally\nan unreliable conductor, agricultural soil\u2014which is irrigated and regularly\nprovided with ions through fertilizer\u2014has much better electrical conductivity.\nThey\u2019ve also found that current follows soil layers; In other words, current\ntends to travel horizontally across a particular stratum of soil. This\ndiscovery informed the transmitter\u2019s vertical design, which allows the current\nto find the best stratum to move through. And they\u2019ve discovered that TTS\nworks best at very low alternating current frequencies, specifically below 50\nkilohertz.\n\nThe TTS system uses underground transmitters and receivers to create a current\ndirectly through the soil.Tennessee Tech University\n\nThe two-acre test network transmitted power at 60 hertz. Transmission\nefficiency fell off as the receivers moved farther from the transmitter. \u201cThe\nmodel shows that improvements can be made by lower contact resistance but also\nin running at higher frequencies, and this is a major focus of our research at\nthe moment,\u201d says Van Neste.\n\nTennessee Technological University has filed worldwide patents on TTS, and the\nresearchers are working towards commercialization with a startup company,\nTerra Watts, Inc.\n\nVan Neste says that TTS can achieve power transfer over \u201ca fairly exciting\ndistance.\u201d He adds, \u201cBetter [transmitter/receiver] contacts are showing\nimproved transfer efficiency. Our ideas have also started to evolve into ways\nof including data transfer in tandem with power, so that sensor systems can\ntransmit their information completely underground. This would allow sensors to\nbe fully buried, and is something we hope to demonstrate soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs long as nothing catastrophic occurs,\u201d says Van Neste, \u201cwe are hoping to\ndemonstrate power transfer over a 150 to 200 meter radius (about 30 acres) by\nthe end of summer.\u201d As part of that test, they plan to use a newly designed\ninverter that produces high-intensity current at low duty cycles. \u201cWe tested\nthis new inverter last week and achieved the same current densities we got in\nthe [Transactions on Industrial Electronics] paper, but at only 10 percent of\nfull inverter operation. We are very excited to explore power transfer over\ngreater areas,\u201d he says.\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * John Deere and the Birth of Precision Agriculture \u203a\n  * Cybersecurity Report: \u201cSmart Farms\u201d Are Hackable Farms \u203a\n\nRelated Articles Around the Web\n\n  * Climate-Smart Agriculture \u203a\n  * What Is Smart Farming? | IBM \u203a\n\niotagriculturesmart agriculturesensors\n\n{\"imageShortcodeIds\":[]}\n\nDouglas McCormick\n\nDouglas McCormick is a freelance science writer and recovering entrepreneur.\nHe has been chief editor of Nature Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical Technology,\nand Biotechniques.\n\nThe Conversation (0)\n\nSort by\n\nArtificial IntelligenceNewsComputing\n\n## AI Copilots Are Changing How Coding Is Taught\n\n16 hours ago\n\n4 min read\n\n2\n\nConsumer ElectronicsNews\n\n## These Recyclable Circuit Boards Could Stem E-Waste\n\n18 hours ago\n\n3 min read\n\nBiomedicalNewsJournal Watch\n\n## Sea Turtle Ears Inspire a New Heart Monitor Design\n\n19 hours ago\n\n2 min read\n\n## Related Stories\n\nEnergyNewsJournal WatchTelecommunications\n\n## Sensor Scavenges Energy From Wire\u2019s Magnetic Field\n\nBiomedicalNewsJournal WatchComputing\n\n## IoT Sentinels Poised for Cardio Emergencies\n\nTelecommunicationsNews\n\n## Satellites Can Be a Surprisingly Great Option for IoT\n\n", "frontpage": false}
