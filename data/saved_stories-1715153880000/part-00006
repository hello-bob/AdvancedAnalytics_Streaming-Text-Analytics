This makes it hard to use hyperbolic\n> embeddings in downstream tasks. Here, we bridge this gap in a principled\n> manner by combining the formalism of M\u00f6bius gyrovector spaces with the\n> Riemannian geometry of the Poincar\u00e9 model of hyperbolic spaces. As a result,\n> we derive hyperbolic versions of important deep learning tools: multinomial\n> logistic regression, feed-forward and recurrent neural networks such as\n> gated recurrent units. This allows to embed sequential data and perform\n> classification in the hyperbolic space. Empirically, we show that, even if\n> hyperbolic optimization tools are limited, hyperbolic sentence embeddings\n> either outperform or are on par with their Euclidean variants on textual\n> entailment and noisy-prefix recognition tasks.\n\nSubjects:| Machine Learning (cs.LG); Machine Learning (stat.ML)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:1805.09112 [cs.LG]  \n(or arXiv:1805.09112v2 [cs.LG] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1805.09112arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Octavian-Eugen Ganea [view email] [v1] Wed, 23 May 2018 13:08:07 UTC\n(1,255 KB) [v2] Thu, 28 Jun 2018 17:20:43 UTC (1,425 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Hyperbolic Neural Networks, by Octavian-Eugen\nGanea and 2 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.LG\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 1805\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs stat stat.ML\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\n### DBLP - CS Bibliography\n\nlisting | bibtex\n\nOctavian-Eugen Ganea Gary B\u00e9cigneul Thomas Hofmann\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\nIArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
