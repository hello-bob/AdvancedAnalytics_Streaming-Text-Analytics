A genetic unsolved puzzle, the Y chromosome was the last chromosome\nto be fully sequenced. With the advent of the Human Genome Project came a\nrealization that the human genome is more than just genes encoding proteins,\nand an entire universe of RNA was discovered. This dark matter of biology and\nthe black box surrounding the Y chromosome have collided over the last few\nyears, as increasing numbers of non-coding RNAs have been identified across\nthe length of the Y chromosome, many of which have played significant roles in\ndisease. In this review, we will uncover what is known about the connections\nbetween the Y chromosome and the non-coding RNA universe that originates from\nit, particularly as it relates to long non-coding RNAs, microRNAs and circular\nRNAs.\n\nKeywords:\n\nY chromosome; non-coding RNAs; lncRNAs; miRNAs; circRNAs\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nThroughout history, humans have been plagued with various diseases, from\nphysical illnesses like cardiovascular infarctions and cancer to psychological\nillnesses such as depression and anxiety. Sex differences between many\ndiseases are well documented, such as lung cancer rates, asthma,\ncardiovascular infarctions, and depression [1,2,3]. Additionally, there are\nnotable differences in cancer mortality and survival rates between men and\nwomen, with men having an increased risk of developing and succumbing to\ncancer [4]. This sex disparity can also be found in relation to SARS-CoV-2\ninfection, with men more likely to die from infection, while females are more\nlikely to have symptoms of long COVID [5,6,7]. In general, there are three\nmajor categories of factors that influence the disparity in disease\noccurrences between males and females. These are genetic, hormonal, and\nenvironmental.\n\nFrom the genetic perspective, biological males have only one X chromosome and\nhave an additional haploid chromosome, the Y chromosome. Early in genetic\nhistory, the Y chromosome was originally considered to be genetically inert,\nexcept for the SRY gene. The presence of this gene and its corresponding\nprotein, the testes determining factor (TDF) [8], results in the presence of\ntestosterone during development, creating the male gonads and sex organs. In\ncontrast, biological females have two X chromosomes, which do not contain the\nSRY gene, resulting in the formation of female sex organs and an increase in\nestrogen production. From the hormonal standpoint, males and females differ in\nthe concentration of the sex hormones: testosterone and estrogen/progesterone\nthroughout the body. These hormones are regulated differently in biological\nmales and females, dependent on their blood concentrations and site of\nproduction [9]. Females tend to have more estrogen and progesterone, while\nmales have much higher levels of testosterone, leading to differences in\nendocrine diseases [10]. Estrogen plays an important role in immune function,\nand thus females are more likely to have autoimmune diseases and thyroid\nautoimmunity [11,12]. Environment is the third major category of factors that\ninfluences the differences in disease states. Contributing factors to these\nenvironmentally based differences include environmental pollution, climate\nchange and employment requirements. Overall, women are more sensitive to\nenvironmental pollution and climate change, while men are more likely to\nreceive workplace injuries and chemical or biological exposures [13,14,15].\nAdditionally, men are more likely to smoke and drink, which has contributed to\ntheir higher rates of cancer throughout history [16]. While each of these\nfactors has an important impact on disease disparity, the impact of the\ngenetic differences between males and females is generally overlooked in favor\nof the hormonal impact of estrogen.\n\nIt is important to note the difference between biological sex and gender in\nthe scope of this paper. Because the focus of this review is on the Y\nchromosome specifically, we will be specifying biological sex as males with an\nXY chromosomal pair and females with an XX pair of sex chromosomes. The\nauthors acknowledge the role that gender may play in some of these diseases as\nwell, as gender influences upbringing environment, social interactions, and\nother societal pressures. This can also influence the prevalence of diseases\ndue to environmental interactions. This remains an active area of research\nwith many interesting avenues to investigate, but as we are specifically\nfocusing on non-coding RNAs originating from the Y chromosome, this review\nwill be focusing on the impact of the Y chromosome on biological sex\nthroughout this article.\n\nNon-coding RNAs, a burgeoning field, particularly including those coming from\nthe Y chromosome, offers incredible potential on tackling these differences\nbetween males and females. Here, we present current literature on the non-\ncoding landscape of the Y chromosome, with particular focus on long non-coding\nRNAs, microRNAs, and circular RNAs. The non-coding landscape holds significant\npotential for personalized medicine, with an emphasis on using non-coding RNAs\nto create more specific treatments. The advent of mRNA vaccines for treatment\nof SARS-CoV-2 has shown the efficacy of this type of nucleic acid treatment\nand its potential to help a wide range of diseases [17,18]. The methodology\nused to create this review was systemic searches through established databases\nsuch as PubMed and Google Scholar. Therefore, we have compiled the most recent\nliterature on the Y chromosome and its non-coding landscape, creating a\ncomprehensive study wherein the non-coding RNAs that have been characterized\nare presented with the intention of increasing visibility of the use of these\nnon-coding RNAs in diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic models of sex\ndisparities.\n\n## 2\\. Y vs. X Chromosome\n\nThe third-smallest chromosome and containing the fewest number of protein-\ncoding genes, the Y chromosome has just over 62 million base pairs [19,20].\nEvolutionary pressure has shifted the Y chromosome from being comparable to\nits partner sex chromosome in gene number to its present state, with only 55\nprotein-coding genes present on the current Y chromosome [21]. The Y\nchromosome in humans, soon after its divergence from the X chromosome, lost\nmost of its genes to the autosomes; however, it retained its likely most\nimportant gene: the sex determining gene, SRY. Interestingly, it has been\nshown that ancestrally, the genes retained on the Y chromosome were not\nrandom, but were evolutionarily selected [22]. Contrary to the human Y\nchromosome structure, the mouse Y chromosome has retained its evolutionary\nsignificance, being 99.9% euchromatin and holds the genetic code for nearly\n700 genes (Figure 1) [23]. This has created a particular paradox for studying\nthe non-coding landscape of the Y chromosome within in vivo studies. While\nmany studies can use the mouse as a model organism, those focusing on the\ngenetic impact of the Y chromosome have additional difficulty.\n\nFigure 1. Comparison between human and mouse Y chromosomes.\n\nIn contrast, the human X chromosome has over 150 million base pairs containing\nthe genetic code for more than 1400 genes [20]. While this creates an expected\ngene imbalance between males and females, evolution has fueled the\ninactivation of the second X chromosome in females through a known mechanism:\nthe Xist long non-coding RNA. Xist is an RNA encoded on the X chromosome that\nselectively interacts with the X inactivation center to silence transcription\nfrom the second X chromosome [24]. This process has been studied since the\n1990s, when Xist was first identified and characterized [25]. Through this\nprocess, Xist is critical for creating genetic balance between males and\nfemales. However, there are between 15% and 50% of genes that can escape X\nchromosome inactivation, based on tissue type [26]. These genes include those\nin the pseudo-autosomal regions, genes with dosage sensitivity or immune-\nrelated, or they can even be bystanders near other escape genes [27]. Because\nmany of the genes are immune related, it is likely that females are receiving\na \u201cdouble dose\u201d of immune-related genes, thereby increasing their immune\nfunction. In turn, this may be impacting the genetic differences between males\nand females in response to certain disease states.\n\nInitial attempts to sequence the human genome expected to identify hundreds of\nthousands of genes to verify the complexity of the human race. However, what\nthey found was the presence of only 30\u201340,000 genes, the rest being considered\n\u201cjunk DNA\u201d [28]. Shortly after, this \u201cjunk DNA\u201d was found to be transcribed\nvery frequently in the form of non-coding RNAs [29]. These new classes of non-\ncoding RNAs challenged the central dogma of biology, in which DNA is\ntranscribed to RNA and directly translated to protein, while simultaneously\ngiving rise to a new avenue wherein the complexity of the human genome may\nbegin to be explained [30]. This complexity can be seen through the changes in\nhuman genome annotations since the first sequencing of the human genome in\n2004 [31]. However, initial sequencing of the Y chromosome presented the\nsequences only for the MSY regions, accounting for just over 50% of the entire\nchromosome [32]. The currently most used version of the human genome was\nstarted by the Human Genome Project in 2013. Additional annotations were\nprovided with improvements in technology in 2019, named GRCh38 [33]. The\nTelomere-2-Telomere consortium released their most recent full sequence of the\nhuman genome in 2022, with complete annotations expected to be released over\nthe coming years [34]. Early annotations of T2T-CHM13v2.0 have been released\nand are currently available through the National Center for Biotechnology\nInformation (NCBI). To avoid additional complexities, they performed the\nsequencing on the female CHM13 cell line. The progression of sequencing of the\nY chromosome has its own challenges, stemming from the long segments of\nheterochromatin and complex repeats within its genetic code, including\npalindromes, duplications of various segments, inversions and many tandem\nrepeats [35,36,37,38]. One of the largest sections of the Y chromosome\u2019s\nheterochromatic regions is the presence of human satellite III [39]. This\nsection is characterized by the pentanucleotide repeat TTCCA, and while the\nhuman satellite III sequences occur on chromosome 1 and 9\u2019s heterochromatin\nand chromosomes 13\u201315, 22, there is no cross-reaction between the chromosomes,\nindicating the sequences are unique, albeit interspersed with the TTCCA\nrepeats [40,41]. Human Satellite III has also been shown to express various\ntranscripts, specifically in response to stress, indicating its transcription\npotential, even though it is comprised of heterochromatin [42,43,44,45]. This\ntheoretical and yet also very real enigma that surrounds the sequence of the\nhuman Y chromosome creates an adverse environment for identifying the genetic\ndifferences between males and females.\n\nLate in 2022, a manuscript identifying the complete sequence of the human Y\nchromosome from the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) at the\nNational Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States was released as a\npreprint through BioRxiv [19]. In August 2023, the manuscript was released and\npublished [19]. As with the full T2T genome sequence, full annotation is\nexpected within the next few years. Additional research published concurrently\nwith the full sequence of the Y chromosome was the full sequence of 43\nvariants of the human Y chromosome, identifying the incredible variation in\nthe Y chromosome within the human population, across nearly 190,000 years of\nevolution [46]. The release of these sequences has been instrumental to\nbeginning investigation into the Y chromosome\u2019s mysterious black box. With the\nrelease of the Y chromosome\u2019s sequence, work to understand the impact of the Y\nchromosome has only begun. As it is a haploid chromosome, and the third-\nsmallest chromosome, men will begin to lose their Y chromosome as they age,\nwhich can then be accelerated by smoking [47,48]. This loss of the Y\nchromosome is incomplete across cell types and has thus been named mosaic loss\nof Y (mLOY), and has been associated with a higher rate of Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n[49], cardiac fibrosis [50], incomplete immune response [51], and implicated\nin increased risk of developing cancer [52]. This risk has been seen across\nvarious cancer types, as seen by a recent publication by Muller et al. in 2023\nthat took a pan-cancer approach to identifying mLOY [53]. Mueller describes\nthat increased genetic instability and aggressive mutation rates are\nassociated with mLOY [53]. This work supports research done across cancer\ntypes, with a publication in 2019 showing worse prognosis relating to mLOY in\nhead and neck squamous cell carcinoma [54]. With the relatively low number of\ngenes associated with the Y chromosome, an important question remains as to\nhow mLOY can impact mutation rates, and further research into the non-coding\nlandscape of the Y chromosome may present the answers.\n\n## 3\\. Non-Coding RNAs\n\nNon-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) is a field has been blossoming throughout the last\ncentury. Ribosomal (rRNAs) and transfer RNAs (tRNAs), the most common classes\nof ncRNAs, were identified as early as the 1950s [55,56]. Newer classes of\nncRNAs, such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and\ncircular RNAs (circRNAs) have been referred to as part of the dark matter of\nthe human genome [57], as they generally originate from repetitive regions and\ntransposable elements within the human genome, once thought to be junk DNA\n[58]. It was not until 1990 (lncRNAs) [59], 1993 (miRNAs) [60] and 1991\n(circRNAs) [61] that each type of ncRNA was recognized as functional and their\nown fields began to grow. Non-coding RNAs can be broken down into two major\nclasses: housekeeping and regulatory ncRNAs [62]. Housekeeping ncRNAs are\nubiquitously expressed regardless of cell type and are important regulators of\nprimary cellular functions, such as rRNAs, tRNAs, and small nuclear and small\nnucleolar RNAs. Regulatory ncRNAs are more restricted in their expression,\nusually tissue and developmental stage-specific. These ncRNAs are further\nbroken down into two categories: long non-coding RNAs and small non-coding\nRNAs. Within these categories, long non-coding RNA counts both linear long\nnon-coding RNAs and circular non-coding RNAs. Some of the most common small\nnon-coding RNAs include microRNAs, piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), silencing\nRNAs, and Y RNAs. The non-coding universe expands beyond those found within\nmammals, including repeat associated small interfering RNAs (rasiRNAs) found\nin plants and Drosophila [63,64]. Currently, there is no evidence of rasiRNA\nexpression in human cells, including the Y chromosome, and Y-linked piRNA in\nhuman cells is not very well characterized [65,66,67]. For this reason, this\nreview will focus on three major classes of non-coding RNAs\u2014long non-coding\nRNAs, microRNAs, and circular RNAs\u2014that are encoded on the Y chromosome.\n\nNcRNAs are at the forefront of efforts to create personalized medicine. Not\nonly from the research standpoint, but for policy and guideline creation,\nthere must be standardized practices that protect the patient and their\ngenetic code, while still using genetically based treatments. Many researchers\nand healthcare professionals have identified various ncRNAs of interest in\ndiseases, such as endometrial and colorectal cancer [68,69,70]. Long non-\ncoding RNAs have been identified as biomarkers in endometrial cancer, and Y\nRNAs have been slowly arising as likely targets for personalized medicine\n[68,71]. There have been numerous studies on delivery systems, particularly\nlipid nanoparticles due to the success of the COVID-19 vaccines [72,73,74].\nThe future of personalized medicine would benefit from additional insight on\nthe Y chromosome, potentially by serving as a biomarker, and Y chromosome\npresence informing clinical treatment modalities.\n\n#### 3.1. Long Non-Coding RNAs from the Y Chromosome\n\nLinear long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of ncRNAs that is among one\nof the most functionally and genetically diverse, and are highly prevalent on\nthe Y chromosome, especially when compared to the numbers of other ncRNAs,\nsuch as other housekeeping or regulatory RNAs. lncRNAs have the highest\nversatility due to their reliance on their secondary and lncRNAs from the Y\nchromosome tertiary structures to function, rather than their sequence, which\nis important, as many lncRNAs are tissue-specific and are not evolutionarily\nconserved [75]. Additionally, most lncRNAs are low expressors under normal\nconditions and only increase in expression during disease states [76]. There\nare four categories of lncRNAs: antisense, sense, intergenic and intronic\n[77]. Antisense lncRNAs are named for the gene they are closest to, on the\nantisense DNA strand to the gene, tagged with a -AS, such as ASMTL-AS1 [78].\nSense lncRNAs are found within the same strand of DNA as the coding gene they\nare named for, and usually contain exonic regions that are not translated,\nsuch as DAPLAR [79]. The most common lncRNAs are the intergenic lncRNAs (also\nknown as lincRNAs), which generally are not found near or overlapping any\ncoding gene [80], such as the linc-SPRY3 family [81]. As evidenced by their\nname, intronic lncRNAs are lncRNAs that come from splicing events of intronic\nregions of coding genes. The Y chromosome has each type of lncRNA; however,\nwith only 50 coding genes, intergenic are the most common lncRNAs present.\n\nTranscribed by RNA polymerase II, many lncRNAs are processed similarly to\nmRNAs, containing a poly-A tail and a guanine cap. Nuclear retained lncRNAs\ngenerally act as pre- and post-transcriptional regulators. Pre-transcriptional\nprocessing is performed through many lncRNAs, such as Xist, a lncRNA that\ncauses epigenetic changes, crucial for X chromosome inactivation [82], or\nMANTIS, which has been shown to influence angiogenic marker expression [83].\nMALAT1 has been shown to perform post-transcriptional processing of mRNAs by\nmodulating splicing and recruiting RNA-binding proteins [84,85]. Many lncRNAs\nwill also localize to the cytoplasm, where they can work as competitive\nendogenous RNAs, like TUG1 [86] and TTTY15, increase stabilization of mRNAs,\nsuch as Sros1 and NEAT1 [87,88], or decay of mRNAs, like EPR and linc00525\n[89,90], regulate protein localization, like ADEPTR [91], or control post-\ntranslational processing of proteins, like Cerox1 [92]. Previously, it was\nassumed that lncRNAs lacked a functional open reading frame to produce any\ncoded peptides; however, recent advances in sequencing have identified many\nlncRNAs have the ability to code so-called micropeptides that contain fewer\nthan 100 nucleotides [93,94]. With their diverse functions, lncRNAs are not\nunique to autosomes, with many being identified from the X and Y chromosomes\nas crucial for normal development, and their dysregulation has been implicated\nin many diseases. Lncipediav5.2 cites nearly 600 lncRNAs identified on the Y\nchromosome; however, many are speculatively placed on the database without\nvalidation [95]. Of the characterized lncRNAs, many have been identified to\nimpact disease states, and many have specific counterparts found on the X\nchromosome. This double exposure further pressures the evolutionary change\nthat drives the downsizing of the Y chromosome, though there are still some\nlncRNAs that are specific to the Y chromosome.\n\nOver time, many lncRNAs have been identified to originate from the Y\nchromosome. These lncRNAs and their functions span from early development to\ndisease onset, biomarkers for cancer and even cancer progression. Table 1\nshows some of the characterized lncRNAs originating from the Y chromosome and\ntheir known functions [81,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108].\nThere have been other lncRNAs identified to originate from the Y chromosome;\nhowever, many have not been characterized, such as the rest of the TTTY\nfamily. With the advances in sequencing over the most recent years, it is\nlikely that emerging research will elucidate the functions of these previously\nunexplored lncRNAs.\n\nTable 1. lncRNAs originating from the Y chromosome.\n\n#### 3.2. MicroRNAs from the Y Chromosome\n\nMicroRNAs are small ncRNAs, processed in segments of about 23 nucleotides in\nlength [109]. In general, microRNAs are categorized into families based on\ntheir seed region. The seed region, which generally begins with the second 5\u2032\nnucleotide of the miRNA, is an eight-nucleotide region crucial for the binding\nof the miRNA to its target [110]. Criteria for identifying and annotating\nmiRNAs were originally described by Ambros et al. and based around expression\nand biogenesis criteria. Proposed miRNAs had to agree with at least one\ncriterion in both categories, due to similarities in expression to silencing\nRNAs (siRNAs) and a non-unique biogenesis pathway. Once determined to be a\nmiRNA, the RNA was given a name \u201cmir-\u201d with its following number related to\nthe order in which it was discovered [111]. Over time, the naming convention\nhas shifted slightly, looking for homologues and locational significance.\nThese families the miRNAs are categorized in are dependent on the sequence the\nseed regions target, and may or may not originate from chromosomal neighbors\n[109]. Understanding the role of specific miRNAs has been challenging. In\nhumans and mice, most pathways have redundancy in their miRNA regulation,\nmeaning specific knockdowns do not always create a phenotype [112].\n\nThe creation or biogenesis of human miRNAs can begin with several primary RNA\nsubstrates, but canonically begins with an intragenic, primary miRNA\ntranscript (pri-miRNA) generated by RNA polymerase II/III from introns or\nexons within the nucleus of the cell [113,114,115]. The primary transcript is\n~70 nt and consists of an RNA transcript with a short hairpin structure and\nterminal loop [116,117]. The pri-miRNA serves as a binding site for DiGeorge\nsyndrome critical region 8 (DGCR8), which recognizes N6-methyladenyladensoine\nfollowing METTL3 modification, and other nucleotide motifs at the primary\nmiRNA hairpin structure, recruiting the ribonuclease III enzyme Drosha,\nforming the microprocessor complex, which cleaves the miRNA duplex at the base\nof this hairpin [113,118,119]. This newly created precursor miRNA is then\ntransported to the cytoplasm via an exportin-5\u2013Ran-GTPase complex [120]. Here\nthe precursor is modified again by the Rnase III endonuclease Dicer, which\ncleaves the terminal loop and leaves a mature miRNA duplex, consisting of 5p\nand 3p strands\u2014derived from the directionality of the 3\u2032 or 5\u2032 end of the\nmiRNA hairpin [121]. Each of the strands within the duplex can be loaded into\nthe Argonaut-2 (Ago-2) protein of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) in\nan ATP-dependent fashion [122]. The loaded strand is known as the guide\nstrand, and normally interacts with the 3\u2032UTR of the target mRNA, leading to\nits degradation via decapping and deadenylation of the mRNA, which decreases\nmRNA stability and leads to translational repression [123].\n\nThe non-canonical biogenesis of miRNAs uses different combinations of proteins\nfrom the canonical pathway, and largely depends on the RNA substrate used.\nThese can be divided into grouped pathways as Drosha/DGCR8-independent and\nDicer-independent, with the substrate of each resembling that of the opposite,\ndependent proteins [115,124,125,126]. Drosha/DGCR8-independent precursor\nmiRNAs resemble Dicer substrates\u2014Mirtrons, from the splicing of introns\u2014and\nare directly transported to the cytoplasm via exportin-1 for Dicer processing\n[115,126,127]. Dicer-independent precursor miRNAs are processed by Drosha from\nshort hairpin (sh-RNA) transcripts, and as they are too short to act as Dicer\nsubstrates, the entire precursor miRNA is loaded into Ago-2, which slices the\n3p strand, leading to 3\u2032-5\u2032 trimming of the 5p strand, which completes the\nmaturation of the miRNA [124,128]. MiRNAs can also bind to other regions of\ntheir target mRNA, including the 5\u2032UTR, coding sequence, and within promoter\nregions [129,130]. Binding to the 5\u2032UTR and coding regions has silencing\neffects on gene expression, while binding at promoter regions induces\ntranscription [130]. mRNA sensitivity to miRNA gene regulation largely depends\non mRNA secondary structures, and alternative splicing can affect miRNA-\nbinding sites [131,132].\n\nmRNA sensitivity to miRNA gene regulation largely depends on mRNA secondary\nstructures, and alternative splicing can affect miRNA binding sites [131,132].\nThis, however, is not the only function many human miRNAs carry, with some\nhuman miRNAs having many canonical functions and many having more than one\nprimary function. Major roles of miRNA in the cell include but are not limited\nto cell\u2013cell communication, proliferation and apoptosis activation or\ninhibition, and the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and invasion in the\ncontext of cancer [133,134,135,136,137].\n\nIn recent years, only four microRNAs have been found to be processed\ntranscripts originating specifically from the Y chromosome\n[138,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148] (Table 2). The biological\nfunction of some of these microRNAs has been found, but many must be\ninvestigated further. MiR9985 has been found to be differentially expressed in\nthe skeletal muscle transcriptome in response to burn trauma, as well as\nacting as a regulator of certain \u201chub\u201d genes in a model of type 2 diabetes\n[149,150]. MiR3690 has been investigated in several studies as a potential\nbiomarker in colorectal and thyroid cancers, as well as hepatocellular\ncarcinoma recurrence following liver transplant [151,152,153].\n\nTable 2. MiRNAs originating from the Y chromosome.\n\nMiR6089 can be divided into two functional groups: inflammation and\ntumorigenesis. This microRNA has been found to play a key role in rheumatoid\narthritis through innate-receptor signaling and macrophage-related\ninflammation [154,155,156,157]. MiR6089 in peripheral blood plasma has also\nbeen found to be a potential biomarker of retinoblastoma [158]. MiR12120 has\nbeen found to actively target SARS-CoV-2 during infection [159].\n\n#### 3.3. circRNA from the Y Chromosome\n\nCircular RNAs (circRNAs) are a unique class of non-coding RNAs. They exist as\nsingle-stranded RNAs that form a covalently closed loop [160]. These looped\nRNAs are generated by back-splicing and are extremely stable, having a much\nlonger half-life than mRNA [161]. The lack of a 5\u2032 cap and a 3\u2032 poly (A) tail\nfurther adds to the uniqueness of these RNAs. While the existence of mammalian\ncircular RNA transcripts has been known since the 1990s, investigations of\ntheir potential functions were delayed due to the belief that they were the\nresult of splicing errors [61,162]. However, advances in sequencing technology\nallowed for a better appreciation of circRNAs, as they were found to be\nabundant across different cell types [161,163]. Further contributing to the\nincreased appreciation of circRNAs was emerging evidence of their role in\nregulating gene expression. Some circRNAs act as miRNA sponges, sequestering\nmiRNA and upregulating or downregulating their target gene\u2019s expression\n[164,165]. They further regulate gene expression by encoding peptides,\nchanging transcription and binding protein complexes [166,167,168].\n\nEvidence of circRNAs originating from the Y chromosome has existed for several\ndecades, with Capel et al. detailing circular transcripts of the murine Sry\ngene in 1993 [169]. However, the authors noted that no circular transcript of\nSry was observed in humans. While Y-linked circRNAs have been extensively\ndescribed in other mammals, only a small number of circRNAs originating from\nthe human Y chromosome have been identified and the function of these circRNAs\nremains largely unknown, e.g., the CIRCpedia v2 circRNA database, which\ncontains more than 180 RNA-seq datasets, predicts the expression of 309\ncircRNAs from 36 coding and non-coding genes present in the human Y\nchromosome, including circ-ZFY, circ-USP9Y, circ-DDX3Y, circ-KDM5D, and circ-\nVAMP7 [170]. However, this prediction has not had significant investigation,\nas most of these circRNAs have not been characterized. This discrepancy\nbetween species could be due to differences in Y chromosome structure. As\npreviously described, the human Y chromosome is notoriously covered in\nheterochromatin, making identification and translation of genes difficult.\nThis may be why the mouse Y chromosome has had significantly more Y\nchromosome-linked circRNAs ascribed to it. Xu et al. showed that the human Y\nchromosome contains the fewest circRNAs, and attributed the lack of circRNAs\nto their short length and number of genes [171]. In a study of sex-chromosome\naneuploidy effects on circRNA expression, Johannsen et al. identified 54\ncircRNAs from the Y chromosome [172].\n\nAlthough Y-linked circRNAs role in human diseases remains largely unexplored,\nrecent reports have demonstrated their potential as biomarkers. Luan et al.\ndescribed a urinary exosomal circRNA ChrY:15,478,147\u201315,481,229 that is\nassociated with more severe renal dysfunction in males compared to females\nwith IgA nephropathy [173]. Further, several Y-linked circRNAs are upregulated\nin coronary heart disease [174]. Many circRNAs are suggested to originate from\nthe Y chromosome, but there is significantly more work that needs to be done,\nnow that the full sequence of the Y chromosome has been released through the\nT2T consortium. These circRNAs have the potential to explain certain sex\ndisparities in cancer, autoimmune diseases, and microbial infections.\n\n## 4\\. Discussion\n\nThe Y chromosome has long been assumed to be mostly biologically inert, beyond\nthe 55 or so proteins it encodes. However, males and females at large have\nexperienced different rates of diseases, both physically and mentally. This\ndifference has been ascribed to genetic, hormonal, and environmental\ndifferences; however, the genetic differences are mainly attributed to the\nwork of the SRY gene. Additionally, loss of the Y chromosome is associated\nwith many diseases, including heart failure and cancer, but the reason for its\nloss is currently unknown. mLOY has been studied within cancer, and\noriginally, it was assumed the Y chromosome was lost because it primarily held\nno use for the cell. However, further studies have identified a host of non-\ncoding RNAs from the Y chromosome. A summary of the noncoding RNAs identified\nin this review is shown in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2. Genomic location of lncRNAs, miRNAs and predicted circRNAs expressed\nfrom the human Y chromosome.\n\nNcRNAs offer a new insight into potential differences between males and\nfemales. The Y chromosome, for all its challenges, offers a new template to be\nused for identifying novel, functional non-coding RNAs. With the release of\nthe full telomere\u2013telomere sequence, cloning advances, and sequencing\ntechniques, studying ncRNAs such as lncRNAs, miRNAs and circRNAs coming from\nthe Y chromosome has incredible potential. lncRNAs are the most prolific\nfamily of ncRNAs identified from the Y chromosome, with varied functions and\napplications. Not all lncRNAs have been found to be implicated in disease\neither, with a few found to be important biomarkers for treatments and good\nprognostic indicators. MiRNAs and circRNAs both have been identified on the Y\nchromosome, with most having a co-expressor on the X chromosome. MiRNAs have\nbeen identified as regulated in trauma response and cancer, with their\nexpression regulating critical genes. circRNAs have been found in normal\ntissue expression, with very few identified to originate from the Y\nchromosome.\n\nThe findings presented here suggest that the Y chromosome has fewer\ncharacterized ncRNAs compared to other chromosomes. However, this does not\nmean there are not others present that have not been validated. circRNAs offer\na strong contender for the most prevalent ncRNA on the Y chromosome, with over\n300 identified, but very few characterized. Further research into epigenetic\nand epitranscriptomic changes, such as new molecular classification, such as\nepitranscriptomics (m6A, m5C, m1A, deamination, pseudourylation), and\nglycoRNAs, could also elucidate new mechanisms for function or regulation over\nthese non-coding RNAs and their potential [175,176]. The lncRNAs identified\npresent significant opportunity for therapeutic benefit, with many identified\nto be prognostic or biomarkers for disease. In the context of personalized\nmedicine, there is ample opportunity to treat patients based on the presence\nof the Y chromosome. For example, if a male patient presents with esophageal\ncarcinoma, targeting linc00278 may decrease the patient\u2019s cancer progression.\nAdditionally, the radio-sensitizing RNA group linc-SPRY3 might be a marker to\nidentify if a male patient will have a stronger reaction to radiotherapeutic\ntreatment. However, identifying if a patient has a Y chromosome is easier than\ntrying to identify if a patient has a specific RNA or gene. The personalized\nmedicine approach could even be extended to a much simpler approach, assessing\nY chromosome presence in patients, as opposed to a specific RNA or gene.\n\nOverall, this review highlights the current research on the non-coding RNA\nfield, specifically lncRNAs, microRNAs, and circular RNAs, related to the Y\nchromosome. Little is known about the miRNAs and circRNAs from the Y\nchromosome, and with the discovery of the full Y chromosome sequences, the\npossibility for novel ncRNAs to be identified leaves the story of the Y\nchromosome at a biological cliffhanger, just waiting to be read.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nConceptualization, E.S.W.-R., M.T.W., T.W.R. and I.M.; writing\u2014original draft\npreparation, E.S.W.-R., M.T.W. and T.W.R.; writing\u2014review and editing,\nE.S.W.-R.; visualization, E.S.W.-R. and I.M.; funding acquisition, I.M.
