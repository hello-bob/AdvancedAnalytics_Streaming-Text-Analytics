That should be\navailable on your website to everyone (minus a few details, probably).\n\nURLs are durable, accessible, re-usable, and searchable. Every communication\nshould have a URL.\n\nTip of the hat to @maddox for cheerleading this concept for years, and to Ben\nBalter, who has a great writeup on this idea. Kyle Neath\u2019s URL Design blog\npost is worth your time, too.\n\n## Make every communication as public as possible\n\nThis pairs well with the earlier point. If you\u2019re already putting the effort\nin to produce some sort of communication, make sure to expose that work to the\nbroadest audience possible.\n\nThat\u2019s the second reason why that long support email should be a blog post.\nYou\u2019ll help more people, folks can discover it on their own, and for all\nfuture instances of that question, you can respond with a link.\n\nThat amazing Discord thread? Write a brief summary for your blog and link to\nit.\n\nThat sales collateral you just posted? Share it on your social channels and\nstart a conversation.\n\nMake. Some. Noise.\n\n## Velocity Matters, Post Everything\n\nA fabled startup mantra goes: Do things, Tell people. Most teams aren\u2019t doing\nthat, though. We build build build build build build build build build build\nbuild build build and then maybe there\u2019s one blog post. And we\u2019re bummed it\ndoesn\u2019t get the traction it should.\n\nBeyond the specific content of a single post, another thing folks are looking\nfor when they check out your content is this... is this thing on? Is this\ncompany shipping? What is happening here?\n\nIf it is worth building, it\u2019s worth telling people about. This is akin to\nAmazon\u2019s fabled \u201cpress release driven development\u201d process, which asks\nengineers to produce a public-facing document describing the value a certain\nproject will have to customers, before they are allowed to build it.\n\nIn the spirit of building velocity and \u201cDo things, Tell people\u201d, consider\ndoing just that. Not a long thoughtful post about how this will change the\nworld - just tell people wht you built. For inspiration, and a great example\nof high-impact low-effort blogging, check out the announcement post when\nGitHub shipped Pull Requests. There have been dozens of posts since then on\nPull Requests, but this is the one that launched it. Build things, tell\npeople.\n\n##### Get in touch Our Writing\n\n", "frontpage": false}
