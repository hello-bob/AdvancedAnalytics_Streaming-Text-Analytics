But the Avars, another nomadic people who subsequently occupied\nroughly the same region of eastern and central Europe, have remained obscure\ndespite having assembled a sprawling empire that lasted from the late sixth\ncentury to the early ninth century. Even archaeologists have struggled to\npiece together their history and culture, relying on spotty and potentially\nbiased contemporaneous chronicles that, in many cases, were authored by the\nAvars\u2019 adversaries.\n\nA deep dive into 424 genomes collected from hundreds of Avar graves is filling\nin crucial gaps in this story, revealing a wealth of insights into the Avars\u2019\nsocial structure and culture^1. \u201cThese people basically didn\u2019t have a voice in\nhistory, and we are kind of looking into them this way \u2014 through their\nbodies,\u201d says Zuzana Hofmanov\u00e1, an archaeogeneticist at the Max Planck\nInstitute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and one of the\nstudy\u2019s lead authors.\n\nThe work was published today in Nature.\n\n## Nine generations\n\nThe researchers focused on four cemeteries in Hungary that were once at the\nheart of the khaganate, as the former Avar empire was known. Importantly, all\nfour sites were fully excavated, giving the researchers access to DNA from\nevery grave and enabling them to use genetic data to map relatedness for\nentire Avar communities.\n\nThis effort got an important boost from a computational method called ancIBD,\nwhich can connect even distant family members on the basis of their shared\nchromosomal sequences^2. Co-lead author Johannes Krause, an archaeogeneticist\nat Max Planck, says that scientists have generally struggled to reassemble\nDNA-based family trees that extend past third-degree relatives, such as first\ncousins or great-grandparents. But by using tools such as ancIBD, Krause and\ncolleagues were able to chart much more convoluted Avar family trees,\nincluding a massive nine-generation pedigree comprising 146 family members.\n\nThe data suggest that, after migrating to Europe, the Avars retained many\ncultural practices from their place of origin on the northeast Asian\nsteppes^3. For example, the Avars were very strict about avoiding inbreeding.\nThere were no observed instances of marriage between relatives \u2014 even at the\nlevel of second cousins. Krasue says that was surprising, given that unions\nbetween first cousins were not unusual during much of European history. \u201cIt\u2019s\nreally remarkable that they can keep track over nine generations who is\nrelated to whom, and who can have children with whom,\u201d he says.\n\nHowever, there was also limited intermarriage with non-Avar neighbors: about\n20% of the genomic sequences in the sampled Avar DNA could be traced to\ncentral European ancestry.\n\nThe researchers recorded several examples of \u2018levirate unions\u2019, in which a\nwidow married a male from the family of her deceased spouse, such as a\nbrother. Such marital patterns were atypical in much of Europe, but were\nestablished features of Asian steppe-dwelling cultures, notes co-lead author\nTivadar Vida, an archaeologist at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University in Budapest. \u201cIt\nwas archaeologically very interesting to see the conservativism in the Avar\nsociety, lasting nine generations,\u201d says Vida.\n\nThe Avars were also strictly patrilineal, with men acting as heads of family\nand daughters leaving their communities to join their husbands\u2019 households. At\nthe largest cemetery sampled, in the village of R\u00e1k\u00f3czifalva, Hungary,\nHofmanov\u00e1 notes that there was only a single instance of both a mother and her\nadult daughter being interred.\n\n## Power play\n\nThe kinship data reveal what seems to be a shift in local political power that\nwould have been difficult to detect with sparse DNA sampling. In the graves at\nR\u00e1k\u00f3czifalva, the researchers found that one male lineage predominated early\nin Avar history, but was displaced by a different Avar bloodline by the late\nseventh century. Intriguingly, archaeological evidence collected from those\ngraves suggests that the subsequent family had different diets and burial\nrituals than did the displaced one, indicating that Avar culture shifted over\ntime despite relatively modest levels of intermarriage with non-Avar\nindividuals.\n\nCarles Lalueza-Fox, a palaeogenomicist at the Institute of Evolutionary\nBiology in Barcelona, Spain, says that this work demonstrates the richness of\nthe insights that can emerge when researchers have the opportunity and\nresources to broadly survey and analyse DNA at sites of historical interest.\n\u201cOnly this scale of analysis would allow you to obtain a reliable picture of\nkinship and social processes,\u201d he says, adding that his group is now embracing\na similar approach in their archaeogenomic research. \u201cI think ancient genomics\nis moving toward this direction to obtain a more democratic and nuanced view\nof the past.\u201d\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01165-7\n\nRead the related News & Views, \u2018Family lines and politicalshifts in the Avar\nempire\u2019\n\n## References\n\n  1.
