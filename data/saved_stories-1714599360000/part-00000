(BBVA) put forth a merger\nproposal to Banco Sabadell SA, sparking renewed discussions on banking\nconsolidation within Europe.\n\nThe potential merger between BBVA and Banco Sabadell would catapult the former\ninto the exclusive club of eurozone banks with more than $1 trillion (\u20ac940bn)\nin total assets, positioning it just behind industry giants such as BNP\nParibas, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, Banco Santander SA, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA, and\nDeutsche Bank AG.\n\nFurthermore, this deal would elevate BBVA to become the third-largest bank in\nthe eurozone by market capitalisation, estimated at approximately $65 billion\n(\u20ac61 billion), trailing only behind BNP Paribas and Banco Santander.\n\nWhile the specifics of the potential deal remain under wraps, Chris Hallam, a\nGoldman Sachs equity analyst, believes that the BBVA/Sabadell \"would be based\non solid industrial logic, given the potential for revenue and cost synergies\ndue to their business overlap in Spain\".\n\nAccording to 2023 figures, this merger could potentially increase BBVA's\nrevenues and net profit by 17%, with a 40% boost in loans and a 22% rise in\nrisk-weighted assets.\n\nDespite the appealing prospects, Hallam pointed out challenges in cross-border\nmergers within the eurozone, due to stringent regulatory frameworks and the\ncomplexities of bank integration. This has made such large-scale mergers less\nlikely, favouring in-market consolidations instead.\n\nThe backdrop for this merger discussion is a sparking a broader trend of\nsignificant market outperformance by eurozone smaller banks compared to larger\nones since the start of the year.\n\nShares of Banco Sabadell have surged by nearly 60% in the first four months of\nthe year. Similarly, Italian small bank BPER Banca SpA has experienced a 56%\nsurge. The once-troubled Italian Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA has seen\nits shares rally by 40%. Banco BPM SpA and Unicaja Banco SA have also mimicked\nthis performance. Notably, none of these five banks has a market cap above \u20ac10\nbillion or total assets exceeding \u20ac250 billion.\n\n## European banking M&A activity expected to pick up in 2024\n\nDealmaking in bank M&A was particularly lacklustre in 2023, reaching its\nlowest level in at least six years, with the fourth quarter of 2023 being the\nweakest three-month period since before 2018.\n\nLooking forward, the European bank mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity is\nexpected to pick up in 2024, driven by decreased inflation and lower\nvaluations, particularly in fintech and advisory services., according to S&P\nGlobal.\n\nThe activity has already commenced in 2024, evidenced by French lender Cr\u00e9dit\nAgricole SA acquiring a 7% stake in Paris-based payments group Worldline SA in\nJanuary.\n\nThere are strong prospects for banks to form joint ventures and partnerships\nwith fintech companies in 2024 as they aim to boost their technological\ncapabilities, per Benoit G\u00e9rard, EMEIA financial services strategy and\ntransactions leader at EY.\n\n## Merger could be a trigger for consolidation\n\nThe increasing market share of North American investment banks in Europe is\nputting significant pressure on European banks. \"That creates quite a\ndifficult competitive dynamic. And in that environment, to be meaningful, it's\nlikely that greater scale makes sense. There is quite some pressure to\nconsolidate,\" noted Hyder Jumabhoy, partner and co-head of EMEA financial\nservices M&A at law firm White & Case.\n\nAs the financial sector stands at the cusp of potentially transformative\nchanges, the focus is also on larger banks like Deutsche Bank, which has been\nlinked with possible acquisitions of ABN AMRO and Commerzbank, despite their\nCEO's reservations about pursuing mergers in 2024.\n\nBottom line, the potential merger between Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria\n(BBVA) and Banco Sabadell could indeed serve as a pivotal trigger for\nconsolidation in the eurozone banking sector.\n\nThis deal not only reflects the increasing necessity for scale in the European\nfinancial landscape but also underscores a broader shift towards strategic\nrealignments in response to competitive pressures and technological\nadvancements.\n\nShare this article Comments\n\n## You might also like\n\nNow playing Next\n\nBusiness\n\n### Putin bares his teeth as Russia takes control of two EU businesses\n\nNow playing Next\n\nBusiness\n\n### EU Policy.

'Quiet hiring' is silently revolutionising the workplace\n\nA person in line for a job interview, illustration - Copyright Euronews\n\nCopyright Euronews\n\nBy Ren\u00e9 Janssen\n\nPublished on 01/05/2024 - 11:01\n\nShare this articleComments\n\nShare this article\n\nFacebookTwitterFlipboardSendRedditMessengerLinkedinVK\n\nThe opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not\nrepresent in any way the editorial position of Euronews.\n\nInstead of constantly expanding the workforce through external hires,\ncompanies are increasingly focusing on upskilling and retraining the talent\nright under their noses, to meet evolving business needs, Ren\u00e9 Janssen writes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn today's fast-paced business environment, maintaining a steady headcount\nwhile simultaneously investing in the professional development of existing\nstaff has become a concern for many organisations.\n\nEnter \"quiet hiring\" \u2014 a sign of the times that allows employers to bridge\ntalent gaps while achieving both objectives.\n\nQuiet hiring is gaining traction as a strategic alternative to traditional\nrecruitment methods. Instead of constantly expanding the workforce through\nexternal hires, companies are increasingly focusing on upskilling and\nretraining the talent right under their noses, to meet evolving business\nneeds.\n\nBy doing so, they not only maintain a stable headcount but also foster a\nculture of continuous learning and growth within their organisation.\n\nJust last year, Gartner listed quiet hiring as one of the top workforce\npredictions for 2023, underscoring its increasing importance. Unlike other\nbuzzwords, quiet hiring appears here to stay and is perfectly positioned to\ndisrupt conventional recruitment strategies.\n\n## Potential sitting right in front of the bosses' noses\n\nThe skills gap has been blown wide open, with AI playing a critical role in\nits expansion. AI is not just a desirable skill anymore; it has become\nindispensable for learning and career progression, and is sought after by\nmost, if not all hiring teams.\n\nThe past year has unveiled an increase in fire-and-rehire tactics, with\nnumerous companies \u2014 including Google, TikTok and Grammarly \u2014 announcing staff\nlayoffs, primarily to accommodate the next phase of an AI-skilled talent.\n\nThese global waves of layoffs have left companies grappling with a bigger\nchallenge: balancing workforce numbers while still investing in the growth of\nteams.\n\n> Upskilling, seen as a strategic investment, offers a pathway for companies\n> to not only weather the storm of layoffs but also to emerge stronger and\n> more competitive in the long run.\n\nView of an office showing the desks with supply chain, manufacturing\nengineering and Q&A staff in Richmond, CA, June 2018Liz Hafalia/San Francisco\nChronicle via AP\n\nThat's where upskilling comes in. Rather than viewing layoffs as the only\nsolution to employee optimisation, management teams are recognising the\nimmense potential that lies within their existing talent pool.\n\nUpskilling, seen as a strategic investment, offers a pathway for companies to\nnot only weather the storm of layoffs but also to emerge stronger and more\ncompetitive in the long run.\n\n  * AI is ushering in a fourth industrial revolution but are we ready for it? Upskilling will be crucial\n  * A task force for the future: Europe's plan to upskill workers to reverse labour shortages\n\nBy investing in upskilling initiatives, companies can empower their employees\nto acquire new skills, adapt to evolving technologies, and take on new\nchallenges.\n\nRather than viewing employees as having fixed skill sets, companies can unlock\nthe untapped potential sitting right within their back office.\n\n## Retrain (and promote) to retain\n\nQuiet hiring also encourages a culture of continuous learning and development\nwithin the workforce, driving employees to proactively seek out and pursue\nprofessional growth opportunities.\n\nThis is done by empowering existing talent, encouraging them to explore\ndifferent roles and projects within the company, and investing in their\ndevelopment. By taking these steps, management teams can mitigate talent\nshortages, all while also driving employee loyalty, satisfaction, and\nretention.\n\nTangible skills have never been more important. In fact, our latest research\nreveals that companies are integrating intentional learning with key skills\nlike leadership, collaboration, and analytical thinking, aiming to both\nnurture professional growth and cultivate a supportive team culture.\n\nHowever, only 26% of workers believe their employer treats them as a whole\nindividual, who can offer unique contributions and a unique portfolio of\nskills to the organisation.\n\nIn order to retain top talent, it\u2019s important that organisations prioritise\ninternal career growth opportunities, reducing overall reliance on external\nhires and steering clear of stagnant career mobility.\n\n> In today's shifting workplace dynamic, a strategic approach to talent\n> management is essential. Quiet hiring, coupled with robust upskilling\n> initiatives, offers a sustainable solution to bridging the skills gap and\n> ensuring long-term success.\n\nA commuter walks with his bike alongside a train at Paris' Saint Lazare, March\n2009AP Photo/Francois Mori\n\nAdmittedly, any amount of change can stir up mixed feelings among employees,\nwhether big or small. It\u2019s expected that some employees may feel hesitant to\nveer off their current path.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, a situation where employees feel they have limited opportunities for\nadvancement or progression within their current organisation can feel much\nmore daunting. This lack of career movement and growth can quickly lead to\nfeelings of stagnation, frustration, and dissatisfaction among employees.\n\n  * The 5 new jobs being created in Europe because of AI\n  * What is 'quiet hiring' and why is it trending in the workplace?\n\nBy implementing tailored training programs and strategies, the shift to a more\nopportunistic environment should feel seamless and stress-free. Rather than\npositioning reskilling or upskilling as an obligation, it's crucial to frame\nit as an opportunity for personal and professional growth.\n\nEmployees should see this as a chance to expand their personal portfolio,\nacquire new skills, and enhance their marketability in an ever-evolving job\nmarket.\n\n## Investing in the future\n\nQuiet hiring and upskilling go beyond just filling immediate talent gaps; they\nare crucial steps in future-proofing the workforce.\n\nBy giving employees opportunities to acquire new skills and embrace emerging\ntechnologies, organisations not only stay competitive but also create an\noptimal environment for career growth.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn today's shifting workplace dynamic, a strategic approach to talent\nmanagement is essential. Quiet hiring, coupled with robust upskilling\ninitiatives, offers a sustainable solution to bridging the skills gap and\nensuring long-term success.\n\nWhen companies prioritise internal talent development and cultivate a culture\nof continuous learning, they position themselves to meet the demands of\ntomorrow and excel in an increasingly competitive market.\n\nOrganisations must be able to look at individuals and understand not only the\nskills they have today and the value they can currently bring to the business,\nbut how they can and want to grow, and how that growth will look for the\nbusiness\u2019s future.\n\nBuilding a talent-first company means that in order to reach business goals,\norganisations must first unlock the potential of their most valuable asset,\ntheir people.\n\nRen\u00e9 Janssen is founder and CEO of Lepaya, an Amsterdam-based edtech company.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt Euronews, we believe all views matter.

Investors will be watching for key metrics that shape\nits stock trajectory.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nApple\u2019s stocks underperformed most of the US tech shares this year due to\nweakened iPhone sales and a lack of AI advancement. Apple\u2019s shares declined by\n12% year-to-date, following Tesla\u2019s 32% drop, making it the second-worst\nperformer among the Magnificent Seven stocks. It has also lost its crown to\nMicrosoft as the world\u2019s largest market cap company due to these setbacks.\n\nHowever, Apple has beaten earnings expectations in the past four quarterly\nreports. Though this doesn\u2019t guarantee a positive reaction from share prices,\nas investors tend to look at more comprehensive metrics when assessing the\ncompany's performance.\n\n  * Riding the AI Wave: Amazon\u2019s growth accelerates in the first quarter\n\n## iPhone sales\n\niPhone sales account for about 60% of Apple\u2019s overall revenue and are seen as\nthe core business of Apple. Typically, Apple\u2019s share prices respond to any\nnews about the newest iPhone sales instantly. In 2023, Apple\u2019s net sales\ngrowth experienced a significant slowdown as users tended to hold onto the\ncurrent phone for longer periods before upgrading, and there was a sales\nslowdown in China, which accounts for approximately 20% of Apple\u2019s global\nmarket share.\n\nIn the final quarter of 2023, iPhone sales in China fell by 13% year on year\ndue to weakened Chinese consumer demand and competition from rivals. In the\nfirst quarter of 2024, global smartphone shipments dropped to 50.1 million,\ndown 9.6% from the same quarter in 2023.\n\n## Services revenue\n\nApple Services has been a bright spot for Apple in recent years as the segment\nis the second biggest revenue contributor, representing about 20% of its\noverall sales. The division, comprising Apple Store, Apple Pay, Apple TV+,\nApple Music, Apple Arcade, and iCloud, generated $85.2 billion in revenue in\nthe fiscal year 2023. Notably, Apple Services is a much more profitable\nsegment than its hardware business.\n\nIn the final quarter of 2023, the services segment\u2019s gross margin was nearly\n73%, while the margin of its product sales, including iPhone, iPad, Mac, and\nother products revenue, was only 40%. This makes Apple\u2019s overall profit margin\n46%, rising from 43% in the same quarter last year.\n\n  * Microsoft to invest in AI and cloud infrastructure in Indonesia\n\n## Other hardware sales\n\nOther hardware sales include iPad, Mac, and wearables, home & accessories,\nwhich contribute about 20% of Apple\u2019s total revenue. All three segments saw a\nsales decline in the full fiscal year of 2023, with iPad sales down 27%, Mac\nsales down 3%, and wearables, home & accessories sales also down 3%,\nrespectively, compared to the fiscal year 2022. In fact, services is the only\nsegment that experienced growth, up 9%, while iPhone sales were down 2% during\nthe same time frame.\n\n## Apple\u2019s AI talk\n\nApple\u2019s underperformance is largely attributed to a lack of AI development\nsince 2023, causing it to fall behind other tech peers. The company has\nrecognized the need to catch up with its vision amidst the intensifying AI\nrace. Apple has been in discussions with OpenAI and Google about potential\ndeals to integrate Chatbot into its iOS 18, though there has been no firm\nconfirmation of either agreement.\n\nApple is expected to unveil progress in AI at the Apple Worldwide Developers\nConference on 10 June. However, any indications of such advancement in\ndiscussions may ignite investors\u2019 optimism ahead of the upcoming earnings\nreport.\n\n## A review of the Q1 FY24 earnings\n\nApple reported its first revenue growth of 2% after three consecutive\nquarterly declines, thanks to a 3% year-on-year growth in iPhone sales. Its\nearnings per share were recorded at $2.18 on revenue of $119.58 billion,\nsurpassing estimates of $2.10 and $117.91 billion, respectively. On a yearly\nbasis, Mac sales rose by a modest 0.6%, iPad sales declined by 26%, sales in\nwearables, home & accessories fell by 11%, and services revenue rose by 10%.\n\nDespite beating earnings expectations, Apple\u2019s shares declined by 4% on that\nday due to weak guidance for the March quarter. Apple expected the iPhone\nsales revenue to remain flat compared to the same quarter last year, with a\nsequential decline of 27%. Services revenue may grow 11% year over year, at a\nsimilar pace to the last quarter.\n\n  * Lufthansa sees losses extend in Q1 after airline figures weighed down by strikes\n\n## Forecast of the Q2 fiscal year 2024\n\nApple's fiscal year differs from the calendar year; its earnings report for\nthe second quarter of the fiscal year 2024 is set to be released on 2 May this\nweek. Analysts forecast that earnings per share will be at $1.51 on revenue of\n$89.99 billion, representing a decrease of 0.7% and 5.1% year over year,\nrespectively.\n\nShare this article Comments\n\n## You might also like\n\nNow playing Next\n\nEconomy\n\n### Eurozone growth tops estimates as April inflation holds steady at 2.6%\n\nNow playing Next\n\nMarkets\n\n### Markets this week: Focus will be on Eurozone CPI and Fed Rate Decision\n\nNow playing Next\n\nEurope News\n\n### Brussels asks Big Tech to curb risks to integrity of EU elections\n\nArtificial intelligence Wall Street Big Tech\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n## Top stories\n\nNow playing Next\n\n## The Brussels boost: How the EU-8 have grown their economies\n\nNow playing Next\n\n## BBVA-Sabadell potential merger: A sign of things to come?\n\nNow playing Next\n\n## Here's the two European countries with no female listed company CEOs\n\nNow playing Next\n\n## Boost for Adidas profits as Sunak puts his foot in Samba trainers\n\nNow playing Next\n\n## Alarming lack of charging points keeps EU climate goals out of reach\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n## Most read\n\n### Putin bares his teeth as Russia takes control of two EU businesses\n\n### Looking forward to a relaxing retirement?
