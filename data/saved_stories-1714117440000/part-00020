However, the subcortical\ncircuitry underlying the stimulating impact of light is not established in\nhumans. We used 7 Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the\nimpact of variations in light illuminance on the regional activity of the\nhypothalamus while healthy young adults (N=26; 16 women; 24.3 \u00b1 2.9y) were\ncompleting two auditory cognitive tasks. We find that, during both the\nexecutive and emotional tasks, higher illuminance triggered an activity\nincrease over the posterior part of the hypothalamus, which includes part of\nthe tuberomamillary nucleus and the posterior part of the lateral\nhypothalamus. In contrast, increasing illuminance evoked a decrease in\nactivity over the anterior and ventral parts of the hypothalamus, encompassing\nnotably the suprachiasmatic nucleus and another part of the tuberomammillary\nnucleus. Critically, performance of the executive task was improved under\nhigher illuminance and was negatively correlated with the activity of the\nposterior hypothalamus area. These findings reveal the distinct local dynamics\nof different hypothalamus regions that underlie the impact of light on\ncognition. They may suggest that light acts on the orexin and histamine system\nto affect the quality of wakefulness.\n\neLife assessment\n\nThis fundamental work describes the complex interplay between light exposure,\nhypothalamic activity, and cognitive function. The evidence supporting the\nconclusion is compelling with potential therapeutic applications of light\nmodulation. The work will be of broad interest to basic and clinical\nneuroscientists.\n\n  * https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.96576.1.sa3\n\n  * Read the peer reviews\n  * About eLife assessments\n\n# Introduction\n\nLight exerts multiple non-image-forming (NIF) biological effects that\ninfluence the quality of sleep and wakefulness, and higher illuminance is\nknown to stimulate alertness and cognition.^1 The biological effects of light\nprimarily rely on a subclass of retinal ganglion cells that are intrinsically\nphotosensitive (ipRGCs) because they express the photopigment melanopsin,\nwhich is maximally sensitive to photons with wavelength \u223c480nm. IpRGCs combine\nthe light signalling of rods and cones to their intrinsic photosensitivity\nand, collectively, the biological effects of light present a maximal\nsensitivity to the shorter blue wavelength of visible light.^2 IpRGCs project\nto multiple subcortical brain areas and their denser projections are found\nwithin the hypothalamus, particularly in nuclei involved in sleep and\nwakefulness regulation.^2,3 The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is the\nsite of the principal circadian clock, receives the strongest inputs from\nipRGC inputs, over the anterior part of the hypothalamus.^4 Other nuclei also\nreceive ipRGC projections: the subparaventricular zone, one of the main output\nroutes of the SCN, the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) and the preoptic\nnucleus (PON), involved in sleep initiation and also found in the anterior\npart of the hypothalamus; the lateral hypothalamus (LH), site of the\norexinergic wake-promoting neurons and melanin-concentrating hormone sleep-\npromoting neurons, found in contrast over the lateral and posterior parts of\nthe hypothalamus.^2,3\n\nThe brain circuitry underlying the biological effects of light has mostly been\nuncovered in nocturnal rodent models.^1,2 Translation to diurnal human beings,\nwhere the later maturation of the cortex allows for complex cognitive\nprocessing,^5 remains scarce. In particular, whether hypothalamus nuclei\ncontribute to the stimulating impact of light on cognition in humans is not\nestablished.\n\nWe addressed this question using ultra-high-field (UHF) 7 Tesla (7T)\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy young adults exposed\nto light of various illuminance while engaged in two different auditory\ncognitive tasks. We find that higher illuminance increased the activity of the\nposterior part of the hypothalamus encompassing the mamillary bodies (MB) and\nparts of the LH and tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN). In contrast, higher\nilluminance decreased the activity over the anterior and ventral parts of the\nhypothalamus encapsulating notably the SCN and another part of the TMN.\nCritically, the pattern of modulation was consistent across the two cognitive\ntasks. Importantly, performance of the complex cognitive task was improved\nunder higher illuminance while the activity of the posterior part of the\nhypothalamus was correlated to task performance. The findings reveal the\ndistinct local dynamics of different hypothalamus areas in response to\nchanging illuminance that may contribute to light\u2019s impact on cognition.\n\n# Results\n\nTwenty-six healthy young adults (16 women; 24.3 \u00b1 2.9 y; Suppl. Table S1)\ncompleted two auditory cognitive tasks encompassing, respectively, the\nexecutive^6 and emotional^7 domains, while alternatively maintained in\ndarkness or exposed to short periods (< 1 min) of light of four different\nilluminances (0.16, 37, 92, 190 melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance -\nmel EDI-lux; Suppl. Table S2) [Fig. 1]. The hypothalamus of each participant\nwas segmented into 5 subparts \u2013 inferior-anterior, superior-anterior,\ninferior-tubular, superior-tubular, and posterior [Fig. 2A] \u2013 so we could\nconsistently extract the regional effect of illuminance change on fMRI blood-\noxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal over most of the hypothalamus volume.\n\n#### Experimental protocol.\n\n(A) Overall timeline. After prior light history standardisation, participants\nperformed executive (always first), emotional and attentional tasks (pseudo-\nrandomly 2^nd or 3^rd, blue arrow). As the attentional task included fewer\nlight conditions, it is not considered in the present manuscript (see methods\nfor more details)\n\n(B) Spectral power distribution of light exposures. Monochromatic orange: 0.16\nmel EDI lux; Polychromatic, blue-enriched light (6500K); LOW, MID, HIGH: 37,\n92, 190 mel EDI lux. For the present analyses, we discarded colour differences\nbetween the light conditions and only considered illuminance as indexed by mel\nEDI lux, constituting a limitation of our study. See Suppl. Table S2 for full\ndetails\n\n(C-D) Tasks procedures. Time is reported in seconds relative to session onset;\nparticipants were pseudo-randomly exposed to the 4 light conditions. (C)\nExecutive task: alternation of letter detection blocks (0-back) and working\nmemory blocks (2-back). (D) Emotional task: lure gender discrimination of\nvocalizations (50% angry (red), 50% neutral (white).\n\n#### Illuminance impact on the hypothalamus subparts.\n\n(A) Segmentation of the hypothalamus in five subparts in a representative\nparticipant. The nuclei encompassed by the different subparts are indicated in\nthe right inset \u2013 according to ^8. ARC: arcuate nucleus; DMH; dorsomedial\nnucleus; LH lateral hypothalamus; LTN: lateral tubular nucleus; MB: mamillary\nbody; POA: preoptic area; PVN: paraventricular nucleus; PNH: posterior nucleus\nof the hypothalamus; SCN: suprachiasmatic nucleus; SON: supraoptic nucleus;\nTMN: tuberomammillary nucleus; VMN: ventromedial nucleus\n\n(B-C) Estimates (beta; arbitrary unit \u2013 a.u.) of the collective impact of\nilluminance variation on the activity of each hypothalamus subpart.

(Refer for Table 2 and Suppl. Tables S3-S7 for full\nstatistics)\n\nActivity dynamics across illuminance for each subpart (colour code as in A).\nResults are displayed per task or stimulus type although no interactions with\ntask or stimulus type were detected. Significant illuminance-by-hypothalamus-\nsubpart interactions were detected for (I-J) the executive task (p=0.041) and\n(K-L) the emotional task (p=0.041).\n\nSmall letter indicate significant difference (p < 0.05) between the following\nsubparts at illuminance: a. 92 mel EDI lux: posterior vs. superior-anterior;\nposterior vs. inferior-tubular; b. 190 mel EDI lux: posterior vs. superior-\nanterior; posterior vs. inferior-tubular; c. 0 mel EDI lux: posterior vs.\nsuperior-tubular; d. 92 mel EDI lux: posterior vs. superior-anterior;\nsuperior-anterior vs. inferior-tubular; e. 190 mel EDI lux: posterior vs.\ninferior-anterior; posterior vs. superior-anterior; posterior vs. inferior-\ntubular; superior-anterior vs. superior-tubular; inferior-tubular vs.\nsuperior-tubular.\n\n#### Differences between hypothalamus subparts in the collective impact of the\nvariation in illuminance on their activity.\n\n#### Statistical outputs of GLMM testing for differences between the activity\nof each subpart of the hypothalamus under each illuminance\n\n## The impact of illuminance variations on the activity of the hypothalamus is\nnot uniform\n\nThe main analyses aimed at isolating differences in the overall impact of\nilluminance changes among the 5 hypothalamus subparts. For each subpart, we\nextracted an index of the illuminance impact as their average regression\ncoefficients between their responses to the tasks and the illuminance levels.\nThese analyses showed significant differences between the hypothalamus\nsubparts for the executive (generalized linear mixed models (GLMM); main\neffect of the subparts; p = 0.002) and emotional (GLMM; main effect of the\nsubparts; p < 0.0001) tasks, revealing that, during both tasks, the variations\nin illuminance affected the activity of the 5 hypothalamus subparts\ndifferently [Fig.2 B-C, Table 1]. For both tasks, there was no significant\nmain effect for any of the covariates and post hoc analyses showed that the\nindex of the illuminance impact was consistently different in the posterior\nhypothalamus subpart compared to the other subparts [p_corrected \u2264 0.05,\nexcept for the difference with superior tubular hypothalamus subpart during\nthe emotional task: p_corrected = 0.09; Table 1]. Importantly, whole-brain\nanalyses confirmed that increasing illuminance resulted in a local increase\nand decrease of activity that could be detected, respectively, over the\nposterior and inferior subparts of the hypothalamus [Fig. 2 D-G]. This shows\nthat our results do not come from a relatively unspecific and widespread\nincrease in BOLD signal surrounding the hypothalamus subparts and that the\neffect of light was most prominent over the posterior and inferior-anterior\nsubparts.\n\n## Opposite dynamics between the posterior and inferior/anterior hypothalamus\nat higher illuminance\n\nThis prompted us to assess the activity of the hypothalamus subparts under\neach illuminance to detail the different regional activity dynamics across the\nhypothalamus. The statistical analyses confirmed that the activity dynamics\nacross illuminance levels differed between the 5 subparts during the executive\nand the emotional tasks (GLMM; subparts-by-illuminance interaction; p = 0.041)\ntasks [Fig. 2 I-L; Table 2]. Post hoc contrasts first considered the impact of\nthe changes in illuminance within each subpart (Suppl. Tables S3-4). The\nactivity of the posterior hypothalamus subpart significantly (p < 0.05)\nincreased under the highest illuminance (190 mel EDI) compared with darkness\nfor both tasks and with the lower illuminances (37 and 92 mel EDI lux) for the\nemotional task. In contrast, for both tasks, the activity in the inferior-\nanterior and inferior-tubular hypothalamus subparts significantly (p < 0.05)\ndecreased under the highest illuminance compared with darkness, and with lower\nilluminances for the emotional task. Finally, the activity of the superior\nanterior hypothalamus subpart decreased under higher illuminance during the\nemotional but not the executive task, while the activity of the fifth\nhypothalamus subpart, the superior tubular subpart, was not significantly\naffected by illuminance changes in either task.\n\nPost hoc analyses also yielded several significant differences between\nhypothalamus subparts (p < 0.05) (Table 2; Suppl. Tables S5-6). For both\ntasks, the activity of the posterior hypothalamus subpart was consistently\nsignificantly higher than the activity inferior-tubular subpart under the\nhighest illuminances (92 and 190 mel EDI lux). For the executive task, the\nactivity of the posterior hypothalamus subpart was also significantly higher\nthan the superior-anterior subpart under the highest illuminances (92 and 190\nmel EDI lux). For the emotional task, the activity of the posterior\nhypothalamus subpart was also significantly higher than the superior-anterior\nsubpart under the highest illuminances (190 mel EDI lux), while the activity\nsuperior-tubular hypothalamus subpart was significantly higher than the\nactivity of the inferior-tubular, inferior-anterior and superior-anterior\nhypothalamus subparts (92 and/or190 mel EDI lux).\n\nThe overall picture arising from these comparisons is that higher illuminance\nincreased the activity of the posterior and superior hypothalamus subparts\nwhile it decreased the activity of the inferior and anterior hypothalamus\nsubparts.\n\n## Performance to the executive task is improved by light and related to the\nactivity of the posterior hypothalamus\n\nFollowing these analyses, we explored whether the changes in activity across\nilluminances were related to cognitive performance. We first considered the\nmore difficult (2-back) subtask of the executive task as it requires higher\ncognitive functions (see method for a full rationale).^6 The analysis revealed\nthat accuracy to the executive task was high in all participants, but accuracy\nto the more difficult subtask (2-back) improved with increasing illuminance\n(GLMM; main effect of illuminance; F = 2.72; p = 0.034; Partial R^2 = 0.1;\nFig. 3A), controlling for age, sex and BMI. Critically, the analysis also\nshowed that performance under each illuminance was significantly related to\nthe activity of the posterior hypothalamus subpart (GLMM; main effect of\nposterior subpart activity; F = 9.43; p = 0.0027; Partial R^2 = 0.09).\nSurprisingly, the association was negative (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the part\nof variance explained by the hypothalamus subpart is distinct from the impact\nof light on performance. In contrast, no significant association was found\nwhen considering the activity of the other four subparts (GLMM; main effect of\nposterior subpart activity; F < 0.62; p > 0.4; Fig. 3 C-D, Suppl. Table S7).\nWe went on and found that the accuracy to the simpler control subtask of the\nexecutive tasks (0-back, see method) was not associated with the activity of\nthe posterior hypothalamus subpart (GLMM controlling for age, sex and BMI;\nmain effect of subpart activity; F = 0.57; p = 0.45; Fig. 3E), suggesting that\nthe association with performance is specific to the 2-back subtask.\n\n#### Impact of illuminance on performance and relationships with the activity\nof the posterior hypothalamus subpart.\n\n(A) Accuracy (percentage of correct responses) to the 2-back increased with\nincreasing illuminance (p = 0.034).\n\n(B) Accuracy to the 2-back task is negatively correlated to the activity of\nthe posterior hypothalamus subpart (p = 0.0027).\n\n(C-D) Accuracy to the 2-back task is not correlated to the activity of the\ninferior-anterior\n\n(C) and inferior-tubular (D) hypothalamus subparts (p > 0.4). Association\nbetween superior-anterior and superior-tubular subparts are not displayed but\nwere not significant (p > 0.6). See Suppl. Table S7 for full details.\n\n(E) \u2013 Accuracy to the 0-back task is not correlated to the activity of the\nposterior hypothalamus subpart (p = 0.45).\n\n(F) Reaction times to the emotional stimuli did not significantly change with\nincreasing illuminance (p = 0.41).\n\n(G) Reaction times to the emotional stimuli are correlated to the activity of\nthe posterior hypothalamus subpart (p = 0.04) with higher activity associated\nto slower reaction times.\n\n(H) Reaction times to the neutral stimuli are not correlated to the activity\nof the posterior hypothalamus subpart (p = 0.6).\n\nSolid and dashed lines correspond to the significant and not significant\nlinear regression lines, respectively.\n\nIn the last step, we explored the reaction times during the emotional task\n(accuracy to the lure task is not meaningful). We found that reaction times to\nthe emotional stimuli were not significantly affected by illuminance (GLMM\ncontrolling for age, sex and BMI; main effect of illuminance; F = 1.01; p =\n0.41; Fig. 3F) and yet, they were significantly associated with the activity\nof the posterior hypothalamus subpart across each illuminance (GLMM; main\neffect of subpart activity; F = 4.34; p = 0.04; Fig. 3G). The association was\npositive meaning that reaction times were longer if activity estimates were\nhigher, which could indicate a reinforcement of the emotional response\ncharacterized by longer reactions.^7 No such significant association was\ndetected when considering reaction times to the neutral items of the task\n(GLMM controlling for age, sex and BMI; main effect of illuminance; F = 1.5; p\n= 0.21; main effect of subpart activity; F = 0.28; p = 0.6; Fig. 3H).\n\n# Discussion\n\nAnimal research has established that the biological impact of light\nilluminance impinges on many subcortical structures, many of which regulate\nsleep and wakefulness.^1\u20134 How these findings translate to human beings is not\nestablished. Here, we took advantage of the relatively high resolution and\nsignal-to-noise ratio of UHF 7T fMRI to determine how illuminance affects the\nactivity of the hypothalamus as, based on animal research, it receives the\ndensest projections from ipRGCs.^2,4 We find that the activity of the\nposterior part of the hypothalamus increases with increasing illuminance\nwhile, in contrast, the inferior and anterior hypothalamus show a seemingly\nopposite pattern and see their activity decrease under higher illuminance.\nImportantly, performance to the complex cognitive task was improved under\nhigher illuminance and was correlated to the activity of the posterior part of\nthe hypothalamus under the different illuminance, though negatively. The\nresults demonstrate that the human hypothalamus does not respond uniformly to\nvariations in illuminance while engaged in a cognitive challenge, and suggest\nthat the posterior part of the hypothalamus may be key in mediating the\nstimulating impact of light on cognition.\n\nThe different nuclei of the hypothalamus do not have clear contrast boundaries\nbased on MRI signals.^8 As a result, achieving nucleus resolution over the\nhuman hypothalamus even using UFH MRI remains out of reach.^9 Therefore, we\ncannot assign the effects we report to a specific nucleus. We can only\nspeculate and present a selection of plausible scenarios that would need to be\ntested. The posterior part of the hypothalamus - delineated in each\nparticipant based on an automatic reproducible procedure^8 - encompasses the\nMB as well as parts of the LH and the TMN. All these nuclei could participate\nto the increased BOLD signal we detect under higher illuminance. The LH and\nTMN, respectively, produce orexin and histamine, which are both known to\npromote wakefulness, while animal histology reports direct projection of the\nipRGCs to the LH.^2\u20134 Orexin is a good candidate to constitute the circadian\nsignal that promotes wakefulness and to counter the progressive increase in\nsleep needs with prolonged wakefulness.^10 Our data may therefore be\ncompatible with an increase in orexin release by the LH with increasing\nilluminance. This would stimulate cognition and maintain or increase\nalertness^1 and may also be part of the mechanisms through which daytime light\nincreases the amplitude in circadian variations of several physiological\nfeatures.^11,12 It could then also be part of the mechanisms through which\nevening light may disturb subsequent sleep^13 when illuminance is higher than\nthe recommended maximum of 10 mel EDI lux for evening light.^14 If the TMN was\nthe hypothalamus nucleus underlying the regional increase in the BOLD signal\nwe report, it could confer a role to histamine in mediating the stimulating\nimpact of light. Of interest, the TMN receives orexin signal from the LH.^15\nAlternatively, our findings may suggest a role for the MBs in mediating the\nimpact of light on ongoing cognition, potentially influenced through its\ninnervation by the TMN.^16\n\nPrevious research indicated that increasing illuminance reduced the activity\nof the anterior part of the hypothalamus encompassing the SCN, either\nfollowing the exposure to light^17 or during the exposure.^18 We extend this\nfinding by showing that the significant decrease in activity extends beyond\nthe inferior anterior hypothalamus and therefore much beyond the SCN. The\ninferior-tubular and inferior-anterior subparts of the hypothalamus \u2013 also\nisolated based on an automatic reproducible procedure^8 - encompass several\nnuclei such as notably the SCN, SON, ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus,\narcuate nucleus and part of the TMN. Again, all these nuclei may be involved\nin the reduction in BOLD signal we observe at higher illuminance. In terms of\nchemical communication, these changes in activity could correspond to a\nmodification of the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) internal or external signalling\nof the SCN which has been implicated in its response to light.^19 GABA\nproduced by the SCN has also been reported to have excitatory properties such\nthat the BOLD signal changes we report may correspond to a reduction in\nexcitation.^19 Likewise, the SCN is also producing other neuropeptides that\ncould affect its downstream targets. As the inferior-tubular subpart of the\nhypothalamus also includes part of the TMN it may be the TMN and its GABA\nproduction that is decreased by higher illuminance.^15 The decrease in BOLD\nsignal with increasing illuminance we report could therefore arguably reflect\na decreased inhibitory signal arising from the anterior and inferior nuclei of\nthe hypothalamus.\n\nImportantly, none of the scenarios we elaborated on are mutually exclusive and\nwe stress overlooked the potential implication of several nuclei as well as\nthe cellular diversity of the nuclei of the hypothalamus.^3,20 We further note\nthat the anterior-superior hypothalamus subpart of the hypothalamus\nencompassing the VLPO and PON sees its activity decreasing under higher\nilluminance during the emotional task, similarly to the anterior-inferior and\ninferior-tubular areas. Likewise, similar to the posterior subpart, the\nactivity of the superior-tubular hypothalamus subpart may be increased under\nhigher illuminance during the emotional task. Whether this represents a task-\nspecific effect arising, for instance, from differences in the salience of the\nauditory stimulus, remains to be determined.\n\nA critical aspect of our results is that the performance to the 2-back\n(executive) subtask was significantly increased when exposed to higher\nilluminance light. The extent of this increase was limited, likely because\nperformance was overall high at all illuminances, but was not detected for the\nsimpler detection letter subtask (0-back). The result contrasts with many\nprevious 3T MRI investigations on the biological effects of light on human\nbrain function which did not report behavioural changes induced by repeated\nshort exposures to light (e.g. ^21\u201323 but see ^24,25). Our 7T MRI study, which\nincludes a sample size larger than many of these previous studies, supports\nthat BOLD fMRI is sensitive in detecting subtle impacts of light on the brain\nand that these detected changes can arguably contribute to the behavioural\nchanges others reported using longer light exposure and other approaches (e.g.\n^26,27 but see ^28).\n\nImportantly, we find that activity of the posterior hypothalamus subpart is\nnegatively related to the performance to the executive task, making it\nunlikely that it mediates directly the positive impact of light on\nperformance. The activity of the posterior hypothalamus was, however,\nassociated with an increased behavioural response to the emotional stimuli.\nThe association between behaviour and the posterior hypothalamus is therefore\nlikely to be complex and may depend on the context, with for instance\ndifferent nuclei or neuronal populations contributing in some instances but\nnot in others.^15,20 It is likely also to work jointly with the decreased\nactivity of the anterior/inferior hypothalamus we detected as well as with\nother non-hypothalamus subcortical structures regulating wakefulness to\ninfluence behaviour, which intrinsically primarily depends on cortical\nactivity. Future research should assess the impact of light on other\nsubcortical structures and on entire subcortical network to determine how\nilluminance modifies their crosstalk as well as their interaction with the\ncortex, to eventually lead to behavioural impacts. These analyses could for\ninstance address whether the regional changes in activity of the hypothalamus\nwe find are upstream of the repeatedly reported impact of light illuminance on\nthe activity of the pulvinar in the thalamus.^1,24 Although it does not\nreceive direct dense input from ipRGCs, it is likely to indirectly mediate the\nbiological impact of light on ongoing cognitive activity.^29\n\nThese knowledge gaps are important to address because acting on light stands\nas a promising means to reduce high sleepiness and improve cognitive deficits\nduring wakefulness as well as to facilitate sleep in the few hours preceding\nbedtime.^14,30\u201335 Light therapy is also a validated means to improve mood and\ntreat mood disorders.^36,37 Light administration can also be considered a\nsimple means to disturb the brain circuitry regulating sleep and wakefulness\nsuch that it can provide insights about novel means to improve their quality.\nFor instance, if orexin and histamine were part of the mechanism through which\nnatural light affects brain functions, their administration may be the most\necological and/or natural means to affect alertness and cognition. Likewise,\nas both orexin and histamine are targets for the treatment of brain disorders,\nour findings could suggest that light may constitute a non-pharmacological\ncomplementary intervention to compounds that are being developed to treat\narousal, sleep, or cognitive dysfunction in brain disorders.^38 It remains,\nhowever, premature in our view to base recommendations on the therapeutic use\nof light based on the MRI findings gathered to date. Targeted lighting for\ninterventions or for precise interference of subcortical circuits will require\na full understanding of how light affects the brain, particularly at the\nsubcortical level. Our findings represent an important step towards this goal,\nat the level of the hypothalamus.\n\n# Methods\n\nThe data used in this paper arise from a large study that is leading to\nseveral publications and part of the methods have been published\npreviously.^29,39,40 The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the\nFaculty of Medicine at the University of Li\u00e8ge. Participants gave their\nwritten informed consent to take part in the study and received monetary\ncompensation for their participation.\n\n## Participants\n\nThirty healthy young adults (19 women; 24.3 \u00b1 2.9 y; Suppl. Table S1) were\nincluded in the analyses. Exclusion criteria were assessed through\nquestionnaires and a semi-structured interview: history of psychiatric and\nneurological disorders, sleep disorders, use of psychoactive drugs or\naddiction; history of ophthalmic disorders or auditory impairments; colour\nblindness; night shift work during the last year or recent trans-meridian\ntravel during the last 2 months; excessive caffeine (>4 caffeine units/day) or\nalcohol consumption (>14 alcohol units/week); medication affecting the central\nnervous system; smoking; pregnancy or breast-feeding (women); counter\nindication for MRI-scanning. All participants had to score < 18 on the 21-item\nBeck Anxiety Inventory (up to mild anxiety),^41 and on the Beck Depression\nInventory-II (up to mild depression),^42 < 12 on the Epworth Sleepiness\nScale,^43 and < 8 on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.^44 Questionnaires\nfurther assessed chronotype with the Horne-\u00d6stberg questionnaire^45 and\nseasonality with the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire,^46 but the\nlatter two questionnaires were not used for the inclusion of the participants.\n\nFor each task, 4 datasets were missing or corrupted data such that 26\nparticipants were included in the analyses of each task (23 participants had\nvalid datasets for both tasks). For the emotional task, two participants\u2019 data\nfailed the MRI quality control (QC) check, and the other two participants were\nexcluded as they did not complete the entire task. For the executive task,\nfour of the participants\u2019 data failed the MRI QC check. Supplementary Table S1\nsummarises participants\u2019 characteristics respective to each task. Overall\nProtocol. Participants completed an MRI session at least one week before the\nexperiment during which structural images of the brain were acquired and which\nserved as habituation to the experimental conditions. Participants then\nmaintained a loose sleep-wake schedule (\u00b1 1h from the habitual sleep/wake-up\ntime) during the 7 days preceding the fMRI experiment to warrant similar\ncircadian entrainment across participants and avoid excessive sleep loss while\nmaintaining realistic real-life conditions (verified using sleep diaries and\nwrist actigraphy - AX3 accelerometer, Axivity, United Kingdom). Volunteers\nwere requested to refrain from all caffeine and alcohol-containing beverages,\nand extreme physical activity for 3 days before participating in the fMRI\nacquisitions. Data acquisitions took place in Li\u00e8ge, Belgium, between December\n2020 and May 2023.\n\nParticipants arrived at the laboratory 1.5 to 2h after habitual wake time for\nthe fMRI scan. They were first exposed for 5 min to a bright polychromatic\nwhite light (1000 lux) and then maintained in dim light (< 10 lux) for 45 min\nto standardise the participant\u2019s recent light history. During this period\nparticipants were given instructions about the fMRI cognitive tasks and\ncompleted practice tasks on a luminance-controlled laptop (< 10 lux). The fMRI\nsession consisted of participants completing three auditory cognitive tasks\nwhile alternatively maintained in darkness or exposed to light: an executive\ntask (25 min), an emotional task (20 min) and an attentional task (15 min)\n[Fig. 1]. The executive task was always completed first, as it was the most\ndemanding task. The order of the following two tasks was counterbalanced.\nBecause it included only 3 light conditions (see below) instead of 5 for the\nother two tasks, the attentional task was not included in the present\nanalyses. An eye-tracking system (EyeLink 1000Plus, SR Research, Ottawa,\nCanada) was monitored for proper eye opening during all data acquisitions.\n\n## Light exposure\n\nAn 8-m long MRI-compatible optic fibre (1-inch diameter, Setra Systems, MA,\nUSA) transmitted light from a light box (SugarCUBE, Ushio America, CA, USA) to\nthe dual end of the fibre which was attached to a stand fitted at the back of\nthe MRI coil that allowed reproducible fixation and orientation of the optic\nfibre ends. The dual branches illuminated the inner walls of the head coil to\nensure relatively uniform and indirect illumination of participants\u2019 eyes. A\nfilter wheel (Spectral Products, AB300, NM, USA) and optical fibre filters\n(monochromatic narrowband orange filter - 589mn; full width at half maximum:\n10 nm - or a UV highpass filter - 433\u20131650nm) were used to create the light\nconditions needed for the experiment (see Fig. 1B and Suppl. Table S2 for in-\ndetail light characteristics).\n\nFor the executive and emotional task, the light conditions consisted of three\ndifferent illuminance of a white, blue-enriched polychromatic LED light (37,\n92, 190 mel EDI lux; 6500K) and one illuminance level of monochromatic orange\nlight (.16 mel EDI lux; 590nm full width at half maximum - FWHM: 10 nm). For\nthe present analyses, we discarded colour differences between the light\nconditions and only considered illuminance as indexed by mel EDI lux,\nconstituting a limitation of our study. In the executive task, participants\nwere exposed to 30s to 70s (median 30s) of light blocks separated by 10s of\ndarkness (< 0.1 lux) and the light blocks were repeated 11 times for each\nlight condition. For the emotional task, participants were exposed to 30 to\n40s (median 35s) light blocks separated by 20s of darkness (< 0.1 lux) and the\nlight blocks were repeated five times for each light condition.\n\nThe attentional task only included a single illuminance level of the blue-\nenriched polychromatic LED light (92 mel EDI lux) and one illuminance level of\nthe monochromatic orange light (.16 mel EDI lux), otherwise the task would\nhave been too long (> 30 min). Participants were exposed to 30s of light\nblocks separated by 10s of darkness (<0.1 lux). The light blocks were repeated\n7 times for each light condition. As mentioned above it is not considered for\nthe present analyses.\n\n## Auditory cognitive tasks\n\nThe tasks were programmed with Opensesame (3.2.8).^47 Participants heard the\nauditory stimuli through MR-compatible earbuds (Sensimetrics, Malden, MA).\nBefore starting the tasks, to ensure optimal auditory perception of task\nstimuli, participants set the volume through a volume check procedure.\nParticipants used an MRI-compatible keypad to respond to task items (Current\nDesigns, Philadelphia, PA), which was placed in the participant\u2019s dominant\nhand. The tasks were separated by about 5 minutes in near darkness, to\nrecalibrate the eye tracking system and to clarify instructions about the next\ntask to the participant.\n\n### Executive Task\n\nThe task consisted of an auditory variant of the n-back task^6 with a working\nmemory 2-back task and a control letter detection 0-back task. Participants\nwere either asked to detect whether the current item was identical to the\nletter presented 2 items earlier (2-back) or whether the current item\nconsisted of the letter \u201cK\u201d (0-back) or using the keypad (one button for\n\u201cyes\u201d, one button for \u201cno\u201d). A block design was used for this task in which\neach block included 15 items and lasted 30s. Task blocks were separated by\n10-20s rest periods and were preceded by an auditory instruction (500 ms)\nindicating the type of task to be completed. Task levels were pseudo-\nrandomised across the 4 light conditions with 3 blocks of 0-back and 4 blocks\nof 2-back per light condition. Emotional Task. The task consisted of gender\ndiscrimination of auditory vocalizations that were either pronounced with\nemotional or neutral prosody.^7 Participants were asked to use the keypad to\nindicate what they believed the gender of the person pronouncing each token\nwas. The gender classification was a lure task ensuring participants paid\nattention to the auditory stimulation. The purpose of the task was to trigger\nan emotional response as participants were not told that part of the stimuli\nwas pronounced with angry prosodies. The 240 auditory stimuli were pronounced\nby professional actors (50% women) and consisted of three meaningless words\n(\u201cgoster\u201d, \u201cniuvenci\u201d, \u201cfigotleich\u201d). The stimuli were expressed in either an\nangry or neutral prosody, which has been validated by behavioural\nassessments^48Click or tap here to enter text. and in previous\nexperiments.^7,49,50 The stimuli were also matched for the duration (750 ms)\nand mean acoustic energy to avoid loudness effects. During each 30 to 40-s\nlight block, four angry prosody stimuli and four neutral prosody stimuli were\npresented in a pseudorandom order and delivered every 3 to 5 seconds. A total\nof 160 distinct voice stimuli (50% angry; 50% neutral) were distributed across\nthe four light conditions. The darkness period separating each light block\ncontained two angry and two neutral stimuli. A total of 80 distinct voice\nstimuli (50% angry; 50% neutral) were distributed across the darkness periods.\n\n## Data acquisition\n\nThe MRI data were acquired in a 7T MAGNETOM Terra MR scanner (Siemens\nHealthineers, Erlangen, Germany) with a 32-channel receive and 1-channel\ntransmit head coil (Nova Medical, Wilmington, MA, USA). Dielectric pads\n(Multiwave Imaging, Marseille, France) were placed between the subject\u2019s head\nand receiver coil to homogenize the magnetic field of Radio Frequency (RF)\npulses.\n\nMultislice T2*-weighted fMRI images were obtained with a multi-band Gradient-\nRecalled Echo - Echo-Planar Imaging (GRE-EPI) sequence using axial slice\norientation (TR = 2340 ms, TE = 24 ms, FA = 90\u00b0, no interslice gap, in-plane\nFoV = 224 mm \u00d7 224 mm, matrix size = 160 \u00d7 160 \u00d7 86, voxel size = 1.4 \u00d7 1.4 \u00d7\n1.4 mm^3). To avoid saturation effects, the first three scans were discarded.\nTo correct for physiological noise in the fMRI data the participants\u2019 pulse\nand respiration movements were recorded using a pulse oximeter and a breathing\nbelt (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany). Following the fMRI acquisition\na 2D GRE field mapping sequence to assess B0 magnetic field inhomogeneities\nwith the following parameters: TR = 5.2 ms, TEs = 2.26 ms and 3.28 ms, FA =\n15\u00b0, bandwidth = 737 Hz/pixel, matrix size = 96 \u00d7 128, 96 axial slices, voxel\nsize = (2x2x2) mm^3, acquisition time = 1:38 min, was applied.\n\nFor the anatomical image, a high-resolution T1-weighted image was acquired\nusing a Magnetization-Prepared with 2 RApid Gradient Echoes (MP2RAGE)\nsequence: TR = 4300 ms, TE = 1.98 ms, FA = 5\u00b0/6\u00b0, TI = 940ms/2830 ms,\nbandwidth = 240 Hz, matrix size = 256x256, 224 axial slices, acceleration\nfactor = 3, voxel size = (0.75x0.75x0.75) mm^3.\n\n## Data processing\n\nFor the MP2RAGE images, the background noise was removed using an extension\n(extension: https://github.com/benoitberanger/mp2rage) of Statistical\nParametric Mapping 12 (SPM12;\nhttps://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/) under Matlab R2019\n(MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts).^51 Then the images were reoriented using\nthe \u2018spm_auto_reorient\u2019 function\n(https://github.com/CyclotronResearchCentre/spm_auto_reorient) and corrected\nfor intensity non-uniformity using the bias correction method implemented in\nthe SPM12 \u201cunified segmentation\u201d tool.^52 To ensure optimal co-registration,\nbrain extraction was done using SynthStrip^53 in Freesurfer\n(http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). The brain-extracted T1-images were used\nto create a T1-weighted group template using Advanced Normalization Tools\n(ANTs, http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/) prior to normalization to the Montreal\nNeurological Institute (MNI) space using ANTs (1mm3 voxel; MNI 152 template).\nThe hypothalamus of each participant was segmented within 1mm3 MNI 152\ntemplate into 5 subparts - inferior anterior, superior anterior, inferior\ntubular, superior tubular, posterior [cf. Fig. 2a] using an automatic\ncomputational approach.^8\n\nFor the EPI images, auto reorientation was applied on the images first. Then,\nvoxel-displacement maps were computed from the phase and magnitude images\nassociated with B0 map acquisition (taken right after the task), using the SPM\nfieldmap toolbox. To correct for head motion and static and dynamic\nsusceptibility-induced variance, the \u201cRealign & Unwarp\u201d of SPM12 was then\napplied to the EPI images. The realigned and distortion-corrected EPI images\nthen underwent brain extraction using the SynthStrip and then the final images\nwere smoothed with a Gaussian kernel characterized by a FWHM = 3mm. The first\nlevel analyses were performed in the native space to prevent any possible\nerror that may be caused by co-registration.\n\n## Statistical analyses\n\nThe whole-brain univariate analyses consisted of a general linear model (GLM)\ncomputed with SPM12. For the executive task, task blocks and light blocks were\nmodelled as block functions. For the emotional task, the auditory stimuli were\nmodelled as stick functions. For both tasks, a high-pass filter with a 256 s\ncut-off was applied to remove low-frequency drifts. For both tasks, stick or\nblock functions were convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response\nfunction. Movement and physiological parameters (cardiac, and respiration),\nwhich were computed with the PhysIO Toolbox (Translational Neuromodeling Unit,\nETH Zurich, Switzerland), were included as covariates of no interest.^54\n\nTwo separate analyses were completed. In the main analyses, we sought to test\nwhether brain responses during the tasks were modulated by overall changes in\nilluminance level. The regressors of task blocks or events were accompanied by\na single parametric modulation regressor corresponding to the light melanopic\nilluminance level (.16, 37, 92, 190 mel EDI). The contrasts of interest\nconsisted of the main effects of the parametric modulation. In the subsequent\npost hoc analysis, we estimated the responses to the stimuli under each light\ncondition. Separate regressors modelled each task\u2019s block or event type under\neach light condition (0, 0.16, 37, 92, 190 mel EDI). The contrasts of interest\nconsisted of the main effects of each regressor.\n\nThe output masks of the segmentation procedure we used to extract regression\nbetas associated with each of the hypothalamus subpart using the REX Toolbox\n(https://web.mit.edu/swg/software.htm).^55 Betas were averaged (mean) within\neach subpart and then across the homologous subparts of each hemisphere. In\nthe main analyses this yielded 1 activity estimate per stimulus type and per\nhypothalamus subpart (i.e. 10 per individual), while in the subsequence\nanalyses, we obtained 5 activity estimates per stimulus type and per subpart\n(50 per individual).\n\nFor visualization of whole-brain results over the entire sample, all\nstatistical maps obtained from the first level analysis were first transferred\nto the group template space and then the MNI space (1x1x1mm^3 image\nresolution). All the registration steps were performed with ANTs. The\nvisualisation was focussed on the hypothalamus regions to assess whether\nincreasing illuminance resulted in local increase and decrease of beta\nestimates within the hypothalamus or whether beta estimates were mainly\ninfluenced by a relatively unspecific and widespread increase in BOLD signal\nsurrounding the hypothalamus.\n\nStatistical analyses of the activity of the hypothalamus subparts were\nperformed in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, NC, USA). Analyses consisted of\nGeneralised Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) with the subject as a random factor\n(intercept and slope) and were adjusted for the dependent variable\ndistribution. As the main statistical analysis was completed for each task,\nthe significance threshold was corrected for multiple comparisons and was set\nat p < 0.025. Direct post hoc of the main analyses were corrected for multiple\ncomparisons using a Tukey adjustment. The subsequent more detailed analyses\nwere considered as post hoc that were not corrected for multiple comparisons\n(p < 0.05). To detect outlier values within the data sets, Cook\u2019s distance > 1\nwas used for exclusion. No outliers were detected for activity estimates of\nboth tasks, while four outlier values were removed from the analyses of the\n2-back and 0-back performance.\n\nThe main analyses included the activity estimates modulated by light\nilluminance as a dependent variable and the hypothalamus subpart and stimulus\ntype (2-back/0-back \u2013 neutral/emotional) as repeated measures (autoregressive\n(1) correlation), together with age, sex and BMI as covariates. The second set\nof post hoc GLMM analyses included the activity estimates of the hypothalamus\nsubparts as the dependent variable and hypothalamus subpart, stimulus type and\nilluminance (0, 0.16, 37, 92, 190 mel EDI lux) as the repeated measures\n(autoregressive (1) correlation), together with age, sex, and BMI as\ncovariates and interaction term between illuminance and hypothalamus subpart.\nThe final set of analyses included performance metrics as dependent variables\n(accuracy to the 2-back or 0-back task - as percentage of correct responses;\nreaction time \u2013 ms - to emotional or neutral stimuli during the emotional\ntask) and included the same repeated measures and covariates ads in the\npreceding set as well as activity of the relevant hypothalamus subpart.\n\nOptimal sensitivity and power analyses in GLMMs remain under investigation\n(e.g. ^56). We nevertheless computed a prior sensitivity analysis to get an\nindication of the minimum detectable effect size in our main analyses given\nour sample size. According to G*Power 3 (version 3.1.9.4),^57 taking into\naccount a power of 0.8, an error rate \u03b1 of 0.025 (correcting for 2 tasks), and\na sample of 26 allowed us to detect large effect sizes r > 0.54 (two-sided;\nabsolute values; CI: 0.19\u20130.77; R2 > 0.29, R2 CI: 0.04\u20130.59) within a multiple\nlinear regression framework including one tested predictor (illuminance\neffect) and three covariates (age, sex and BMI).\n\n# Data and code availability statement\n\nThe processed data and analysis scripts supporting the results included in\nthis manuscript are publicly available via the following open repository:\nhttps://gitlab.uliege.be/CyclotronResearchCentre/Public/xxxx (the repository\nwill be created following acceptance / prior to publication of the paper).\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors thank Christine Bastin, Annick Claes, Christian Degueldre,\nCatherine Hagelstein, Gregory Hammad, Brigitte Herbillon, Patrick Hawotte,\nSophie Laloux, Erik Lambot, Benjamin Lauricella, Andr\u00e9 Luxen, Pierre Maquet,\nand Eric Salmon for their help over the different steps of the study.\n\nThis study was supported by the Belgian Fonds National de la Recherche\nScientifique (FNRS; CDR J.0222.20), the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research\nand innovation program under the Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie grant agreement No\n860613, the Fondation L\u00e9on Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ricq, ULi\u00e8ge - U.
