That means the PSUs themselves only deliver\n12V to the board, which then handles the 5V supply by itself. This also means\nthat using off-the-self PSU is very limited, especially because the board\nexpects +12VSB (stand-by voltage), as opposed to the standard 5V. There are\nworkarounds available (google it), but I resorted to using an HP power supply.\n\nThe G5 system 450W PSU I use, with three 18A 12V rails\n\nFor the record, while the HP Z2 G9 can be configured with 3 different PSUs,\nyou can use PSUs from other compatible systems. Notably, the PSU must have a\n7-pin PWRCMD connector, as opposed to a 6-pin That is, however, not enough, as\nnot all PSUs have enough wires in the connector, and my conclusion at this\npoint is that any PSU with black cabling and a 7-pin PWRCMD connector will\nwork with this system. I am myself using it with an HP G5 450W PSU, which has\nGold certification \u2014 although Platinum ones are also available.\n\n7-pin connector with 7 black wires, plus three 12V connectors\n\nAlso worth noting is that there isn\u2019t anything proprietary about those PSUs\noutside of the connectors: all of the cabling is standard ATX. In fact, before\nthey switched to using all-black cabling, all of the cable colors used matched\nthe ATX standard.\n\n# FANs#\n\nAnother proprietary solution is HP fan connectors. They are compatible with\nregular PWM fans, but the HP CPU fan comes with 5 pins, instead of regular 4.\nPins 1-4 are the same as in the standard, pin number 5 is crucial to get the\nsystem to NOT report fan incompatibility upon POST. Their fans come in at 65W\nand 125W TDP versions. So far, what I found, is that to emulate 125W, one\nneeds to connect pins 3 and 5. Shorting pins 3, 4, and 5 will allow the system\nto not report when the fan is missing entirely. More on that later. The system\nwill also report a missing chassis fan, CHFAN2 (P9 in manual). This one is a\nregular, 4-pin one. The solution here is to short pins 3 and 4. The problem,\nunfortunately, is that HP fan implementation is not exposed to the system, so\nlm-sensors is not able to control them. That wouldn\u2019t be that bad if not for\nthe fact that they tie the fan speed to the CPU usage, not the temperature.\nAnd this in itself wouldn\u2019t be a problem if they didn\u2019t tie them to a single\ncore usage, which results in fans blasting as soon as the system sees even\nmodest utilization, around 3-5%. See this thread on HP forums for details: Re:\nHP Z2 G9 \u2014 CPU Fan starts spinning at full speed even if only one or two cores\nare at 100% usage With that in mind, you need to resort to an external fan\ncontroller to take the control back. You\u2019ll also need to short pins 3, 4, and\n5, as explained above, to avoid the POST complaints. Some recommended options\nare Corsair and NZXT, which luckily come with Linux kernel support, together\nwith liquidctl to control them. More here: liquidctl\n\n# Motherboard and its non-standard size#\n\nMotherboard diagram (HP Z2 G9 Tower Service Manual)\n\nAll of these HP/DELL/Lenovo motherboards come in non-standard sizes. They are\nMicro-ATX by lengths, but exceptionally wide. This has both pros and cons: You\ncan\u2019t use them in regular ATX cases, most likely. I don\u2019t have a problem with\nit, since I have it installed in a custom IKEA shelving\n\n# Features#\n\nOutside of the non-standard size mentioned above, the board has:\n\n  1. Excellent IOMMU grouping. Pretty much every single device has its own group. No ACS overrides needed. No issues in passing GPU, Mellanox SRIOV VFs, or SATA controller to the VMs:\n    \n        root@proxmox:~# for d in /sys/kernel/iommu_groups/*/devices/*; do n=${d#*/iommu_groups/*}; n=${n%%/*}; printf 'IOMMU group %s ' \"$n\"; lspci -nns \"${d##*/}\"; done IOMMU group 0 00:02.0 Display controller [0380]: Intel Corporation Raptor Lake-S GT1 [UHD Graphics 770] [8086:a780] (rev 04) IOMMU group 10 02:00.0 PCI bridge [0604]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

HP Flex IOv2 connector, so you can add an extra 10Gbit NIC or a relatively inexpensive HP 3UU05AA Thunderbolt 3 extension card (which takes up PCI slot 4 as well).\n  4. I219-LM Gigabit Ethernet with vPro support.\n  5. Extra USB connectors on the other end of the board\n  6. Only 4 PCI slots. Slot 1 is PCIe5 x16. The rest are PCIe3 x1, x4, x4. A typical 2.5-width GPU card will leave you with a single PCI slot 4 free \u2014 unless you resort to some creative PCI ribbon risers.\n  7. 4 SATA ports. You need a P160 HP cable to power the disks, as the PSU being ATX12VO does not come with SATA power cabling.\n  8. An onboard USB header, used to connect the Media Card reader. Unfortunately it is non-standard, so you can\u2019t use it to connect the Corsair/NZXT fan controller unless you figure out the pinout.\n\n# Issues running it#\n\n## 13th gen \u201cPCA not fully compatible\u201d error#\n\nAfter updating to the 13th gen, I am seeing a \u201cPCA not fully compatible\u201d\nerror. This is actually discussed on ServeTheHome forums, affecting the HP Z2\nG9 Mini system, without any definitive conclusion at the time of writing this.\nI myself have no clue what\u2019s causing this: the fan is rather unlikely since\nyou can disconnect it altogether and the SKU error still shows, followed by\nthe \u201cmissing fan\u201d error. The PSU is also unlikely, since AFIK there\u2019s no way\nfor the motherboard to know the model of the PSU connected. There is another\nrevision of the motherboard, which is said was released to fix some 13/14th\ngen compatibility issues, but HP themselves have not confirmed that, and all\nof the posts on their forums that ask for help with the very same issue were\nleft with no response from HP.\n\nUnfortunately, the system will not post past this error unless you acknowledge\nit with a keyboard press. I did not notice any other compatibility issues with\nthe 13th gen on top of the 12th gen. Goes without saying the firmware is up to\ndate.\n\n## Power consumption#\n\nWith no external devices connected and the system idling, 64GB (2 x 32 GB) ECC\nRAM, and 2 x Lexar NM 710 1 TB SSDs, the power consumption measured off the\nwall is 4.5-5.5W for 12600k and 5.0-6.5W with 13600k, which is astonishing. It\ncould potentially get even lower even still with a Platinum PSU! AMD clearly\ncannot compete here at all:\n\n6.4W of peak consumption at the wall while idling\n\nThe system would reach C10 states with 12600k, but only C8 states with 13600k\n\u2014 I am not sure if the latter is expected.\n\nThe C8 levels observed with 13600k processor and no device in PCI slot 1\n\nUnfortunately, some serious problems start as soon as I connect PCI devices.\nSpecifically, with the AMD 6600 XT GPU connected to slot 1, the system will no\nlonger enter deeper C-states, stopping at C2:\n\nThe C2 levels observed with 13600k processor and a GPU in PCI Slot 1\n\nI believe this is because the PCIe5 slot 1 is connected directly to the CPU,\nwhich apparently limits the C states to 2, as reported by Matt Gadient. So\nwhile the GPU is very efficient, idling at 4 W only, the system\u2019s consumption\nspikes up to 40-55W. Combined with my Mellanox 4 LX and some USB devices + 4 x\n2.5\" idling HDDs, the total idle consumption is 55W-70W. This is,\nunfortunately, on par with similarly configured, idling AM5, with regular,\noff-the-shelf components.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that all of the devices have ASPM enabled, as reported by\nthe lspci:\n\n    \n    \n    root@proxmox:~# lspci -vv | awk '/ASPM/{print $0}' RS= | grep -P '(^[a-z0-9:.]+|ASPM )' 00:01.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Device a70d (rev 01) (prog-if 00 [Normal decode]) LnkCap: Port #2, Speed 32GT/s, Width x16, ASPM L1, Exit Latency L1 <16us LnkCtl: ASPM L1 Enabled; RCB 64 bytes, Disabled- CommClk+ 00:1b.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Device 7ac4 (rev 11) (prog-if 00 [Normal decode]) LnkCap: Port #21, Speed 16GT/s, Width x4, ASPM L1, Exit Latency L1 <64us LnkCtl: ASPM L1 Enabled; RCB 64 bytes, Disabled- CommClk+ 00:1c.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Alder Lake-S PCH PCI Express Root Port #1 (rev 11) (prog-if 00 [Normal decode]) LnkCap: Port #1, Speed 8GT/s, Width x4, ASPM L1, Exit Latency L1 <64us LnkCtl: ASPM L1 Enabled; RCB 64 bytes, Disabled- CommClk+ 00:1d.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Alder Lake-S PCH PCI Express Root Port #13 (rev 11) (prog-if 00 [Normal decode]) LnkCap: Port #13, Speed 16GT/s, Width x4, ASPM L1, Exit Latency L1 <64us LnkCtl: ASPM L1 Enabled; RCB 64 bytes, Disabled- CommClk+ 01:00.0 PCI bridge: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

This is considering NVIDIA GPUs are\nactually worse than AMDs in idle. I have not tested the system with Windows\nyet, it would be interesting to see whether I can confirm those numbers \u2014\nespecially in light of what is reported on C2 levels enforced by occupying\nCPU-bound PCI slots.\n\n## RAM issues with Intel x710 NIC#\n\nAnother weird issue is happening with an Intel x710 installed in PCI slot 4 in\nplace of the Mellanox. I figured I would want to reduce the overall power\nconsumption by using the Intel NIC, which is reported to be more power\nefficient. Unfortunately, with Intel NIC installed, the system POSTs with half\nof the memory, i.e. 32GB in my case. Super odd issue, I would need to have\nsomeone try to replicate it, otherwise it may sound like the motherboard is\nsomehow broken. Although it\u2019s interesting that I am not getting such an issue\nwith the Mellanox installed.\n\n## Turbo speeds#\n\nI am convinced the motherboard doesn\u2019t have good enough VRMs to support over\n125W of consumption and, as a result, the CPU will hardly ever get close to\nthe Turbo speeds, even if the thermals permit it. This is even with the High-\nPerformance Mode enabled in BIOS, on both 12th Gen and 13th Gen CPU (so the\n[SKU issue](#13th-gen-PCA-not-fully-compatible\" error is rather not at fault).\nThis would be somehow expected, considering how the Mini version of the same\nsystem struggles with the same, as reported by Linus Tech Tips.

Having to\nmanually press \u201cEnter\u201d to boot with a 13th gen CPU can be worked around by\nresorting to a 12th gen CPU.
