The Greenland Ice Sheet, which\ncovers more than 1% of Earth\u2019s land surface and nearly 80% of Greenland\u2019s\nlandmass, obscures much of the island\u2019s subglacial geology. As a result,\nscientists have largely interpolated the island\u2019s geology from rocks exposed\nat the ice sheet\u2019s margins.\n\n## This newsletter rocks.\n\nGet the most fascinating science news stories of the week in your inbox every\nFriday.\n\nSign up now\n\nIn 2009, Peter Dawes of the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland\nproduced the island\u2019s landmark geologic map, which is still widely used today.\nThe map has served as a critical tool for documenting geologic characteristics\nand meaningfully evaluating economic resources on the world\u2019s largest island.\nIn recent years, however, technological advances in seismic imaging,\ngeophysical surveys, and satellite mapping of gravity and magnetic anomalies\nhave created opportunities to improve Greenland\u2019s geologic map.\n\nMacGregor et al. used these advancements to redraw Greenland\u2019s geologic\nprovinces. Pulling from 19 data sets, the authors delineated an updated map of\nGreenland\u2019s subglacial geology. Additionally, they introduced a novel \u201cflow-\naware\u201d hillshade (a method for highlighting terrain on a map) based on the\nidea that an ice mass transfers a topographic signature from the land over\nwhich it flows to its surface.\n\nThe resulting geologic map clarifies the extent of Greenland\u2019s geologic\nprovinces and confirms that a greater variety of provinces exists in northern\nGreenland than in southern Greenland. Three distinct subglacial regions could\nnot be reconciled with the geology at the island\u2019s margins. In addition, newly\nmapped geologic structures offer updated perspectives on how ice flows from\nGreenland\u2019s interior toward the coast.\n\nThe mapping effort also revealed dozens of unusually long, straight, nearly\nparallel valleys beneath the ice. These valleys are not captured by current\nsyntheses of Greenland\u2019s subglacial topography, which raises the possibility\nthat tectonics may have influenced the island\u2019s geology more than previously\nrealized.\n\nThe authors acknowledge that the updated geological map is an incomplete\nrepresentation of Greenland\u2019s subglacial geology\u2014and that nothing beats eyes\nand boots on the ground to examine the rocks present. Nevertheless, the work\noffers a modernized framework for interpreting the landmass\u2019s subglacial and\nsolid Earth properties that can be incorporated into a variety of related\nscientific disciplines.
