TechSpot means tech analysis and\nadvice you can trust.\n\nForward-looking: Despite being one of the most practical and effective\ntechnologies for storing and delivering electric energy, lithium-ion batteries\nhave started to show their limits. Scientists are looking for alternative\nmaterials and energy storage solutions, but researchers now say they can make\nli-ion batteries work better and for extended periods.\n\nA team of European researchers from Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) and\nHumboldt University in Berlin developed an alternative charging solution to\nmake li-ion batteries last much longer than they do now. The study shows that\nbatteries become more resilient and retain a higher energy capacity after\nhundreds of discharge-recharge cycles by changing how the charger delivers\ncurrent to electrolyte materials.\n\nLithium-ion batteries are compact, robust energy containers that have become\nubiquitous. Electric vehicles and electronic devices rely on them, but their\ncapacity gradually degrades as electrolytes pass through the membrane that\nseparates the anode and cathode. The best commercial-grade lithium-ion\nbatteries available use electrodes made of a compound known as NMC532 and\ngraphite, and they provide a service life of up to 8 years.\n\nConventional charging uses a constant current (CC) of external electric\nenergy. The study analyzed what happened to battery samples when using the CC\ncharging and discovered that the anode's solid electrolyte interface (SEI) was\n\"significantly thicker.\" Furthermore, they found more cracks in the NMC532 and\ngraphite electrode structures.\n\nA thicker SEI and more cracks in the electrodes mean a significant loss of\ncapacity for the li-ion batteries. So, the researchers developed a charging\nprotocol based on pulsed current (PC). After charging the batteries with the\nnew PC protocol, the team discovered that the SEI interface was much thinner,\nand the electrode materials underwent fewer structural changes.\n\nThe team used two of Europe's leading synchrotron facilities for particle\nacceleration, \"BESSY II\" and \"PETRA III,\" to conduct the pulsed-current\nrecharging experiments. They discovered that PC charging promotes the\n\"homogeneous distribution\" of lithium ions in the graphite, which reduces\nmechanical stress and cracking in the graphite particles. The protocol can\nalso suppress structural degradation in the NMC532 cathode.\n\nThe study shows that high-frequency pulsing with square-wave current produced\nthe best results. The tests show that PC charging can double the service life\nof commercial li-ion batteries with an 80 percent capacity retention.\n\n\"Pulsed charging could bring many advantages in terms of the stability of the\nelectrode materials and the interfaces and significantly extend the service\nlife of batteries,\" said TU Berlin professor Dr. Julia Kowal, co-author of the\nstudy.\n\n10 comments 57 likes and shares\n\nShare this article:\n\n### Tech Jobs: Find the next step in your career\n\n### Related Stories\n\n  * Innovative sand battery can heat entire town for a week\n  * GM and Ford EVs can use Tesla Superchargers starting next year, more to follow\n  * Eco-friendly \"water batteries\" are cheaper and safer than lithium-ions\n  * Apple wants an exemption for older phones to comply with India's universal charging regulation\n\n### Featured on TechSpot\n\n  * Innovative sand battery can heat entire town for a week\n\n  * World's fastest camera can capture 156.3 trillion frames per second\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * 49 comments\n\nCompaq, Gone But Not Forgotten: The Best-Selling PC of the 1980s and 1990s\n\n  * 22 comments\n\nNew Affordable AMD B650 Motherboard Roundup\n\n  * 30 comments\n\nRepair shop reports receiving 200 melted RTX 4090s per month, up from last\nyear\n\n  * 14 comments\n\nThe DiskMantler can take apart a hard drive in as little as 8 seconds by\nvigorously shaking it\n\nLoad Comments 10\n\n...\n\nUser Comments: 10\n\nGot something to say?
