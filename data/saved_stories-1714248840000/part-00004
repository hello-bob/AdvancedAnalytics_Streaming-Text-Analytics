Credit: Candler Hobbs\n\nEngineers at Georgia Tech have designed a process that converts carbon dioxide\nremoved from the air into useful raw material that could be used for new\nplastics, chemicals, or fuels.\n\nTheir approach dramatically reduces the cost and energy required for these\ndirect air capture (DAC) systems, helping improve the economics of a process\nthe researchers said will be critical to addressing climate change.\n\nThe key is a new kind of catalyst and electrochemical reactor design that can\nbe easily integrated into existing DAC systems to produce useful carbon\nmonoxide (CO) gas. It's one of the most efficient such design ever described\nin scientific literature, according to lead researcher Marta Hatzell and her\nteam. They have published the details in Energy & Environmental Science.\n\n\"All of my team's research projects focus on decarbonization, which I care\nabout because of climate change, but this one in particular has the\nopportunity to make an impact and move toward commercialization more quickly,\"\nsaid Hatzell, associate professor in the George W. Woodruff School of\nMechanical Engineering and the School of Chemical and Biomolecular\nEngineering. \"That's why publishing our work is important, to help get this\ntechnology out into the real world.\"\n\nTypically, the DAC process involves pulling carbon dioxide out of the air\nusing some kind of chemical or material that wants to grab the CO_2 molecules.\nTo release that captured carbon\u2014to store it underground, for example, or\nprocess it for productive reuse\u2014requires significant energy and complicated,\nexpensive systems. Along the way, those systems usually lose some of the CO_2,\noften only using half of the carbon they've removed from the air or less.\n\nHatzell's team is focused on improving an approach that uses a liquid alkaline\nsolution called KOH to capture the carbon in a DAC system. The KOH turns the\ngas CO_2 into bicarbonates, which eventually have to be separated again.\n\nThe Georgia Tech design avoids that expensive, energy-intensive step\naltogether.\n\nWorking with Jihun Oh's lab at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and\nTechnology, researchers created a new nickel-based catalyst and paired it with\na bipolar membrane electrode assembly. Their setup uses electricity to extract\nCO_2 from the bicarbonates right next to the catalyst, which then converts it\nto carbon monoxide gas.\n\nCredit: Georgia Institute of Technology\n\nThat's the secret sauce of the system designed by Hatzell, postdoctoral\nscholar Hakhyeon Song, and Ph.D. students Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez and Po-Wei Huang:\nIt combines two steps into one.\n\n\"We're capturing the CO_2 into carbonates, which is a spontaneous process and\ndoesn't take much energy. And we're getting rid of the desorption process and\nall of that energy expenditure,\" Fern\u00e1ndez said. \"We save about 90% of the\nenergy in the capture process, and about 50% of the capital cost.\"\n\nTheir setup also is extremely efficient at using all of the CO_2 that moves\nthrough the reactor, according to Song. This is vastly better than systems\nthat keep the carbon dioxide as a gas throughout the separation process.\n\n\"We're twice as efficient. Our CO_2 utilization efficiency is almost 70%, but\nthe gas-phase system is 35%,\" Song said. \"The maximum CO_2 utilization in gas-\nbased systems is theoretically 50%. But in our case, our maximum efficiency is\n100%.\"\n\nIn another important advance, the team's catalyst works well in an acidic\nenvironment, which has been a limitation of existing systems using bipolar\nmembranes. When the reactor layer with the catalyst turns acidic, another\nchemical process called a hydrogen evolution reaction occurs that competes\nwith the reaction that reduces CO_2 to CO. The new nickel-based catalyst\nsuppresses this interference.\n\nProducing carbon monoxide from the CO_2 scrubbed from the air is a\ncomplicated, intensive process. But if done economically, the resulting raw\nmaterial could be linked to existing chemical processes and turned into new\nuseful products.\n\nMaking those connections is next on the team's plate. CO can become the basis\nfor plastics, important industrial chemicals like ethylene, and maybe even jet\nfuel one day.\n\n\"That's why we chose CO,\" Fern\u00e1ndez said. \"Other products are harder to make,\nand CO is a good base for any carbon chemical. You can go from CO to almost\nanything through thermochemical processes.\"\n\nMore information: Hakhyeon Song et al, Integrated carbon capture and CO\nproduction from bicarbonates through bipolar membrane electrolysis, Energy &\nEnvironmental Science (2024).
