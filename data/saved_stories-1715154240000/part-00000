This post serves\nas a brief review of the history of EAI, its current developments, as well as\na discussion of its future outlook.\n\n## 1\\. Early Foundations of EAI\n\nThe idea of EAI was first extensively explored in Rodney Brooks\u2019s research\npaper \u201cIntelligence without representation\u201d published in 1991 [1], which\nproposed the radical view that intelligent behavior could arise directly from\nthe simple physical interactions of an autonomous machine with its\nenvironment, without the need for complex algorithms or internal\nrepresentations.\n\nThen in 1999, Rolf Pfeifer and Christian Scheier wrote \u201cUnderstanding\nIntelligence\u201d to argue that intelligence is not confined to the brain or\ncertain algorithms, but is a comprehensive manifestation of the entire bodily\nstructure and function of an agent [2]. By this view, the authors opposed the\ntraditional brain- or computation-centric understanding of intelligence,\nemphasizing the fundamental impact of the body on the formation of\nintelligence.\n\nStarting from cognitive science, Linda Smith proposed the \u201cembodiment\nhypothesis\u201d in 2005, which emphasizes the core role of the body\u2019s interaction\nwith its environment in cognitive processes [3]. According to the embodiment\nhypothesis, our thinking, perception, and capabilities are formed through\ncontinuous interactions between our bodies and the physical environment.\nParticularly, the embodiment hypothesis emphasizes the essential role of the\nenvironment, considering it not only provides sensory inputs, but also\nparticipates in forming bodily behaviors and cognitive structures.\n\nThese foundational studies highlight three principles for developing EAI\nsystems. First, EAI systems must not rely on predefined, complex logic to\nmanage specific scenarios. Second, it is essential that EAI systems\nincorporate evolutionary learning mechanisms, enabling them to adapt\ncontinuously to their operational environments. Lastly, the environment plays\na pivotal role in shaping not just physical behaviors, but also cognitive\nstructures.\n\n## 2\\. Recent Developments of EAI\n\nRecent advancements in foundation models, such as large language models\n(LLMs), vision language models (VLMs), and the application of technologies\nsuch as ChatGPT in humanoids [4] have led to a common but incorrect belief\nthat EAI is solely about having these foundation models performing inference\ntasks in robots to enhance the robots\u2019 cognitive capabilities.\n\nFoundation models like GPT-4, BERT, CLIP, and DALL-E enhance robots\u2019 ability\nto interpret both visual and textual information, significantly improving\ntheir perception. These models allow robots to perform complex tasks by\nunderstanding context, objects, and instructions more akin to human\ninteraction [5]. Also, these foundation models do satisfy principle one of EAI\nsystems design, such that the inferences of these foundation models do not\nrely on predefined logic to manage specific scenarios.\n\nHowever, these foundation models alone do not encapsulate the full spectrum of\nEAI system requirements. These models must be integrated with evolutionary\nlearning frameworks to learn effectively from their physical interactions with\nopen environments. In addition, we need to develop a virtual environment to\nefficiently interact with the EAI systems, as obtaining real-world interaction\ndata is extremely costly and inefficient [6].\n\nOne demonstration of principle two is the development of the Deep Evolutionary\nReinforcement Learning (DERL) framework [7], which allows for the exploration\nand testing of various agent morphologies in response to environmental\nchallenges, significantly enhancing the morphological and behavioral\nadaptability of the agents. In addition, with new morphologies come new data\nto improve the foundation models\u2019 capabilities to adapt to the new\nenvironment. Therefore, beyond just utilizing foundation models for inference,\nit is crucial to establish an effective feedback loop that facilitates\ncontinuous enhancements, enabling robots to adapt dynamically to their\noperating environments.\n\nWith foundation models to extend robots cognitive capabilities, and an\nevolutionary learning framework to adapt to new environments, a virtual\nenvironment that can effectively emulate the real world and interact with the\nEAI systems is imperative to satisfy principle three. One recent example is\nthe Habitat platform [8], which facilitates the development of EAI by\nproviding a highly efficient, photorealistic 3D simulation environment where\nvirtual robots can be trained. Habitat has been demonstrated in improving EAI\nsystems, specifically in tasks like point-goal navigation, where the\nplatform\u2019s ability to provide massive, scalable training environments can\nsignificantly enhance learning outcomes over traditional methods.\n\n## 3\\. Future Outlook\n\nBy integrating the three components mentioned above, we can build a fully\nfunctional EAI system capable of dynamically adapting to different operating\nenvironments. The natural next step is to teach robots to understand the\nphysical world, such as the concept of gravity. We believe teaching robots\nphysical laws through data is the immediate barrier to the widespread adoption\nof robots in our daily lives.\n\nDespite significant advances in AI and robotics, current robotic systems still\nlack a deep, intuitive understanding of the physical world. Research has shown\nthat while robots can perform certain tasks or mimic certain aspects of human\nbehavior, they don\u2019t have true human-like understanding [9]. This problem can\nbe addressed by generating accurate physical interaction data with the virtual\nenvironment and improving the foundation models with these interaction data\nthrough evolutionary learning mechanisms.\n\nSeveral approaches have been explored to teach robots the laws of physics. One\napproach to address this problem is PLATO, which has been proposed to learn\nphysics by watching simulated videos depicting objects interacting according\nto the laws of physics [10]. This system can distinguish between realistic and\nnonsensical scenarios, such as objects disappearing or behaving in impossible\nways. By training PLATO with videos where objects follow predictable, physical\nlaws, the AI learns to anticipate and understand basic physical concepts,\nwhich enhances its general reasoning about the physical world.\n\nA second approach explores how generative neural networks can learn physical\nconcepts and compares these learning trajectories with those of children [11].\nThe study evaluates two hypotheses regarding developmental processes:\nstochastic optimization and complexity increase. It finds that while neural\nnetworks can acquire a broad range of physical concepts, their sequence of\nlearning these concepts does not align with the developmental trajectories\nobserved in children. This discrepancy suggests that these models, despite\ntheir sophistication, do not entirely capture the nuanced ways in which humans\ndevelop physical understanding.\n\n## 4\\. Conclusion\n\nThis post traces the evolution of EAI from its conceptual underpinnings to\nmodern applications and future challenges. Particularly, we have highlighted\nthree principles for developing EAI systems. First, EAI systems must not apply\npredefined, complex logic to manage specific scenarios. Second, EAI systems\nneed to incorporate evolutionary learning mechanisms to continuously provide\nfeedbacks. Third, a virtual environment that interacts with EAI systems is\nrequired for interaction data generation. Recent research advances have\nsatisfied these three principles individually, but we have yet to see a fully\nfunctioning commercial system that incorporates all three components. When\nsuch a system is ready, an imminent challenge is to teach EAI systems to\nunderstand physical laws for them to operate smoothly in the physical world.\n\nReferences\n\n  1. Brooks, R.A., 1991.
