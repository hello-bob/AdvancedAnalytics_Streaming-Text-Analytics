I've been using Glove80 for several\nweeks, so let's examine its pros and cons.\n\nIt's time for another keyboard review. I've previously reviewed the ZSA\nMoonlander and the Kinesis Advantage 360Pro. When I read raving reviews about\nthe Glove80 from MoErgo, I had to try it out. I sent an email to MoErgo, and\nwe talked about the Keyboard. When they saw my previous reviews, they were\nkind enough to send me the Glove80 from MoErgo a pair with my configuration. I\nwant to thank them for the units. As with all my reviews, I'll go straight to\nthe point.\n\nI've been using Glove80 for several weeks now, so let's examine its pros and\ncons (nit: this is a lengthy review; get your coffee or tea before diving in)\n\n## What is Glove80?\n\nIf you have used a split keyboard in the past, you can skip this section.\n\nIf you're new to mechanical keyboards, the Glove80 will look very different\ncompared to other keyboards. First, the keyboard comes with two pieces instead\nof a single one, and the split allows you to reposition the halves to minimize\nulnar deviation, which causes carpal tunnel. Here is a picture of using a\nstandard keyboard. You can see how the wrists are bent.\n\nSecond, unlike other keyboards, it has a concave key well and thumb cluster to\ncomfortably reach all keys, reducing finger and thumb strain and stress. These\nergonomic keyboards also have adjustable tenting mechanisms that further\nimprove hand positions. Along with other features, the Glove80 is a low-\nprofile, mechanical keyboard that provides an ergonomic position for your\nhands and allows you to type for a long time.\n\nNow, let's dive into the various features of the Glove80. You'll see there is\nmore to it.\n\n## Accessories & Case\n\nFirst of all, the Glove80 came with a large travel case. I was amazed by it\nbecause the case was superbly built and perfect for transporting your Keyboard\nfrom one place to another. It's very protective. However, I think the word\n\"travel\" doesn't fit the description properly because it's anything but\ntravel-friendly. It's huge, almost like a 13-inch Laptop case. I tried If I\ncould fit it into my backpack, and surprisingly, even though it looked huge,\nit could fit into my 21L backpack:\n\nWould I use it when I go to a coffee shop? Probably yes, depending on if I\nfeel like to travel with it. But it would definitely come with me if I\ntraveled for several weeks and stayed in an Airbnb. I like the case, and the\nbest part is that it's included with Glove80 upon purchase.\n\nAnother benefit of the case is the peace of mind of receiving it. The keyboard\nhas a highly protective case, so you can be sure nothing will happen to it.\n\nWithin the case, you'll receive quite a bit of accessories: Some spare\nkeycaps, plastic, o-rings (I'll explain those in a bit), a USB-C to USB-A\ncable, a keycap puller, rods, and a spanner for tenting (more on this later).\nOf course, the Glove80 comes as a ready-to-use keyboard; you don't have to\nsolder or build anything yourself manually (this might be obvious for some,\nbut in the Mechanical Keyboard world, keyboards are often sold as \"kits\", and\nyou need tools, such as soldering iron to build your kit. Most of them don't\ncome with keycaps either).\n\nThe low profile design makes it easy to carry it.\n\nBut if you want, you can also order a Glove80 as a kit to solder your favorite\nswitches yourself. At least there is an option for that.\n\nThe legs of the Glove80 don't perfectly align with the desk, so you have\nseveral plastic o-rings that you can put in between the legs. That way you can\nachieve a perfectly leveled keyboard.\n\n## Configuration and Design\n\nPeople who know me that I'm into design, especially iconic furniture I try to\nbuy and use goods that blend into my work environment. When I visited the\nMoErgo website, there were four options in terms of color I could choose:\n\n  * White keycaps on a white or black body.\n  * Black keycaps on a white or black body.\n\nI got the white keycaps on the white body option, and as you can see from the\nphotos, it looks nice. Before I explain my keycap choice, I want to share a\nfew words about the design.\n\nFirst, Glove80 needs to get rid of the sharp edges. It's the only electrical\nitem on my desk with sharp edges. Here is a video that shows some of them.\n\n0:00\n\n/0:09\n\nDo they bother me? Not at all. You might think it looks good, but the design\nshould not harm you. Initially, I had a few issues because my mouse was\nbetween the two halves, and I would always bump into these sharp edges.\n\nSecond, Glove80 is very lightweight. It feels sturdy but not as premium as the\nMoonlander or the Kinesis Adv360. You can feel a weight when you hold the\nkeyboards, but not so much with the Glove80. I plan to fix it by designing a\ncustom 3D base and filling it with sand (or any heavy material). I also\ndiscovered that people buy weights, such as https://www.amazon.com/Hyperwear-\nBooster-Hyper-Weighted-Vests/dp/B002O5JYVU/ and use double-sided tapes (i.e.,\n3m LS300).https://www.amazon.com/Hyperwear-Booster-Hyper-Weighted-\nVests/dp/B002O5JYVU/ It looks like a straightforward thing to do. I'll share\nmore about this once I have something working.\n\nThe Glove80 has a unique design compared to other items on my desk. The sharp\nedges around the keyboard are not problematic, but smoother corners would be\nappreciated.\n\nHowever, I have been using the Glove80 for many weeks now, and this lightness\nisn't an issue. Yes, it would be nice if it stayed or had a more premium\nfeeling, but it didn't bother me. I believe MoErgo will improve the case even\nfurther in the future. Also, I didn't see many talking about this, but being\nlightweight means it's not.\n\n## Keycap and switches\n\nThe Glove80 provides several switch configurations. For the record, I never\nused a Kailh Choch v1 switch. All my keyboards had MX switches, so I knew\nthere would be a shorter distance. But my previous switch was a MX Brown, and\nbefore that, I used MX Red and MX Red silents. When I ordered the Glove80, I\nwent with the Kailh Choc v1 Red Pro Linear switches.\n\nThe Glove80 with the Kaih Choch v1 Red Pro switches.\n\nThe Glove80 has a great page describing all other options. The number one\nreason I picked up this switch is the low actuation force of 35 gf. I wanted\nvery light switches (That's something I still miss from my Apple Magic\nKeyboard days). One thing I didn't like with the Browns was that my fingers\nwere tired after a long session. Let me show a typing session:\n\nSo, how do they hold so far? I love them. When I first used them, I had\nmultiple erroneous typings I would accidentally type, but things have improved\nin a few weeks. I can't complain. If I would order again, I will pick up the\nsame switches.\n\nI also ordered additional multimedia and macOS keycaps for keycaps. The\nkeycaps don't feel very premium, one reason is of course because of the Choch\nswitches. However, using the keycaps for quite a bit and changing them, I\ndiscovered something I would never have thought to be an advantage:\n\nI can use any keycap on any switch!\n\nDue to the size and various key differences on the Kinesis Advantage 360Pro,\nswapping or changing keycaps wasn't possible. That's not the case with the\nGlove80. This is probably obvious for many, but I love the consistency.\n\n## Tenting and Palm rests\n\nGlove80 supports tenting. Unlike other keyboards, it's highly customizable and\ncontinuously adjustable. What exactly means \"continuously? Unlike other\nkeyboards with only a few settings, you can configure it to any distance. This\nis very important for personal customization, as it allows you to change the\nheight of your keyboard to your liking.\n\nHowever, with greater power comes also a great responsibility. What I mean is\nthat the tenting mechanism is not very user-friendly. With Kinesis, for\nexample, I could increase the height on the go with a press of a button, but\nit wasn't as flexible as the Glove80. But with Glove80, you need to unscrew\nthe legs and use rods to change the length. But here is another question: Does\nsomeone constantly change the lengths of the legs during the day? I doubt it.\n\nHence, even though setting the legs is highly mechanical and needs time, it\npays more long-term. Because unlike other keyboards, it allows you to set up\nyour keyboard in any way you want. And I mean it. Here are some photos from\nthe Glove80 user community that use their keyboards in very different setups:\n\nVarious mounting setups of the Glove80 keyboard\n\n## Battery Life and LEDs\n\nThe Glove80 is a wireless split keyboard, so you can use it without plugging\nit into your computer. When I received my Glove80, I charged it once, and\nsince then, it's still working, and I haven't charged it yet. That's very\ncool. I don't use the LEDs, and the only time they are activated is when I\nswitch to the magic layer (via the MoEergo key).\n\nThe magic key is great because you can immediately see the battery status of\neach pair. Here is a photo of it:\n\nGreen and orange LEDs show each half's battery capacity. The upper row is the\nleft half, and the lower row represents the right row. Here, you can see that\nthe left (also the primary half) has a lower battery capacity. That's expected\nbecause the lower half is the brain of the split keyboard and does more work.\n\nAs you see, the Glove80 has an RGB LED per key, which is a great feature.\nHowever, the ZMK firmware is limited, and you can't program individual LEDs\nper key. However, they are working on it, and I think we'll receive an update\nsoon that enables us to do per-key RGB programming.\n\nThe Glove80 at night.\n\n## Firmware flashing\n\nFirmware flashing is probably the best part about Glove80. It's way better\nthan the Kinesis Advantage360 Pro in any way.\n\nFirst, instead of two files, you get a single FW file. It doesn't matter which\npart you flash with this file because you drop it into each bootloader.\n\nSecond, you don't have to compile it manually on your MacBook or use GitHub\nAction (or any other build system) to build the firmware. Glove80 made an\nonline build farm with a UI that allows you to save your ZMK layouts, build\nthem, and download them. It's perfect.\n\nOnline layout editor of Glove80\n\nThe UI has many rough edges; I think it could be better. But these details can\nbe improved with time. For example, it would be nice to copy/paste the\nparameters of a key and paste them into a different key; this is especially\nuseful when you want to propagate specificthan similar keys to upper/lower\nlayers.\n\n## My custom ZMK configuration\n\nAs with all modern split keyboards, the Glove80 has configurable firmware.\nBecause it's a wireless split keyboard, it comes with ZMK. Luckily, I already\nused ZMK with the Kinesis, so I had a plan for configuring my layout. It's\nsimilar to the Kinesis but with a few key differentiations. I still have three\nlayers. First of all, here is the factory default for macOS that my layout is\nbased on: https://my.glove80.com/#/layout/glove80-macos and ou can find my\ncustom layout here:\nhttps://my.glove80.com/#/layout/user/b1f46e12-afc0-4ab6-ad72-5afb5b8e5abf\n\nLet's start with the specific layer:\n\n  * Backspace is mapped to Cmd \u2318 (see LGUI on the left thumb cluster), which I use frequently. Having it on my thumb cluster makes my everyday tasks more ergonomic.\n  * Delete is mapped to Backspace because it's more natural.\n  * Right Ctrl is mapped to Esc, the perfect place for the Esc key. Close to when you need it, but not so close that it hinders you.\n  * Now that I have function keys (F1, F2, etc.), I configured some of them as media control keys (prev, next and play/pause), and some for volume control. F1 and F2 control the brightness so that the whole row can be used to change the settings of my MacBook.\n  * I changed the Shifts to Sticky Shifts (via the &sk parameter). It's still a shift, but you don't have to hold it forever. Instead, you can press the shift and then jump and press another key. The shift will be applied to that character. This is very handy for characters far from the shift key.\n  * The \u201c quote key above the RALT key is a mod-tap. It means holding it means Ctrl, but tapping outputs the ' or \" characters. I found it very ergonomic to have the Ctrl key on both sides of your keyboard, and depending on which Ctrl key combination I use, I use the opposite Ctrl key. So ctrl + p means I press the left ctrl key and the P key. Ctrl + a means I press and hold the right \" key (which triggers the right ctrl when holding) and the A key.\n  * The F key is a layer tap. Holding the F key switches to the Lower layer. More on this below.\n  * I have defined several constants, HYP , HYPER and MACLOCK.\n\n    \n    \n    #define HYP(key) LS(LC(LA(LG(key)))) #define HYPER LS(LC(LA(LGUI))) #define MACLOCK LG(LC(Q))\n\n  * Hyper is a combo key that simultaneously presses Cmd + Option + Alt + Shift. Pressing all four of these is uncomfortable, but the beauty of a Hyper key is that you can create custom global shortcuts to apps. Previously, I had to use some key combinations to avoid race conditions or duplications. The Left Ctrl, Left Alt, Home, and End keys on my left thumb clusters are all Hyper keys.\n  * HYP is just a shortcut to combine it with other keys. You can see I have 3 HYP mappings. These are used to take screenshots via CleanShotX. One opens RayCast, and one opens 1Password. Hyper + 8 opens 1Password for me, Hyper + 5 CleanshotX, and Hyper + 7 Raycast.\n  * Lastly, I use MACLOCK to lock my MacBook. I create these constants because they document my layout better.\n\n  * The F key is a layer tap and holding the F key switches to the Lower layer. That way, I can tap any output number by having the F key and pressing any of the keypad keys on my right keyboard.\n  * Sometimes I need free one of my hands (when I'm on the phone, for example). In this case, I use the dedicated \"lower\" key (via &tog 1). That toggles to the lower key, and I can quickly write numpads.\n\n  * As I said earlier, the Space is a layer tap, and holding it switches it to the Symbol layer.\n  * The whole symbol layer contains a set of all my highly used symbols. Holding Space and pressing a key on the left half of my keyboard prints symbols like ! @ # $ % ^ & ( ) { } [ ] | ~ ` Once you get used to it, it's much faster than using Shift and numbers to print them.\n  * On the right, I use VIM-like navigation arrows. Hence, I can easily navigate by pressing the holding space and using the HJKL keys.\n  * The symbol layer also has the entire F1-F9 row. Even though I don't use any of them, it's nice to have access to them in case there is a crucial combination looking for them.\n\nAs you see, my layout is not that crazy. But if you want, you can go crazy. A\nvast community builds custom layouts with a more sophisticated setup. One\nexample is using home-row mods: https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods\n\nIf you have seen my layers, I use the F key similar to a home row mods. But\nthe home row mods are a far superior but complex layout. I'm thinking a lot\nabout implementing it in the future.\n\nLastly, I changed some of the configurations for my &mt and &sk parameters:\n\n    \n    \n    &mt { tapping-term-ms = <180>; flavor = \"tap-preferred\"; retro-tap; }; &sk { release-after-ms = <2000>; quick-release; };\n\nThese settings can be read from the ZMK documentation website and must be\nadjusted according to your typing speed. So read the documentation and tweak\nthem (or remove them) to your liking.\n\n## Community\n\nOne fantastic aspect of Glove80 is the community aspect. Honestly, it wasn't\nsomething I evenly considered when I decided to get the keyboard. But it's\nimpressive because you can connect with other Glove80 users and share your\nknowledge. People share their latest mods, keymaps, photos, etc.\n\nGlove80 has an amazing community and support via its Discord channel.\n\nIf you're reading this, and you have questions unanswered in my review or want\nto say \"Hi\", join the Discord channel: https://www.moergo.com/discord The\nfounder and CEO also hang around in the discord channel, and none of the\nquestions go unanswered.\n\n## Comparison to Kinesis Advantage 360Pro\n\nI immediately received this question when I said I ordered the Glove80. How\ndoes the Glove80 compare to the Kinesis?\n\nI've got the questions because I've been a Kinesis user for almost years. I\nused the Kinesis Advantage 2 (I modded it with the KinT controller and added\nQMK support) and the last released Kinesis Advantage360 Professional. Let's go\nstraight into it:\n\n  * The Kinesis feels more premium and solid, with a heft to it. The Glove80 is shallow and very light. Coming from the Kinesis, you can immediately feel the difference.\n  * The Kinesis has different keycap sizes, and hence it's not possible to swap keycaps. The Glove80 uses the same 1U size everywhere, which means every single keycap is interchangeable. This is a massive advantage because it allows you to customize your keyboard.\n  * Both support tenting. Tenting via Kinesis is straightforward; no expertise is needed, and it just works out of the box. But it's not as flexible as Glove80. From user-friendliness, Kinesis wins, but flexibility-wise, Glove80 wins because it's more sophisticated and provides more options for the tent and mounting it the way you want.\n  * Flashing the firmware on the Kinesis is a chore and exhausting. It's also prone to errors because it uses two different files to flash the keyboard. Glove80 has a better online editor and streamlined the flashing experience. I loved it more, and it allowed me to make quick changes more often because of how quickly I could download and flash my keyboards.\n  * Glove80 has a better thumb cluster compared to the Kinesis. The kinesis was already my golden standard, but Glove80 made it even better. The most prominent change is that the thumb cluster is nearer and more tidy. You can reach all 6 keys on the Glove80, but I can't say the same about the Kinesis. Having said that, I sometimes miss the large, 2u-sized keys of the Kinesis thumb cluster. But the more I use the Glove80, the more I get used to it, and it wasn't an issue as I thought.\n  * The concave key well is the main feature of both keyboards. The Glove80 also has an advantage because it moved the pinky finger row even higher than the Kinesis. If you have a small hand, the Glove80 feels much better. Combined with the Kailh Red Pro switches, extended typing sessions are no longer tiring. I feel more relaxed and fast.\n  * Customer support is excellent for both companies. Both companies provide great documentation, albeit I think Glove80 has better documentation. It's more detailed. Second Glove80 has the Discord community, which is a huge advantage. It's just nice to have someone you can talk to.\n  * They both use ZMK, so there is no difference here, but something is worth mentioning. You can easily port your changes because they use both ZMK. Imagine you start typing; here is a picture of a test via Monkeytype that I took just after two days of using a Glove80:\n\n  * Why am I sharing this picture? It's because the transition is almost seamless. This is another aspect I didn't think of but is worth mentioning. The Glove80 is the only keyboard on the market that seamlessly transitions from one keyboard to another. Don't sleep on this.\n  * The Kinesis costs $459, and the Glove80 costs $399. They are similar in price, but the Glove80 is cheaper. However, Glove80 is also more affordable in Europe because the import taxes are lower than the Kinesis. However, I think there is not much of a big difference. Building a custom keywell, ergonomic keyboard is expensive, as reflected here.\n  * Lastly, Bluetooth connection. After using the Glove80 for almost a month, I can now say that Glove80 is way better regarding connection stability. With the Kinesis, I occasionally had drops and disconnections. I wasn't sure why that would happen so often, but since I use the Glove80, both the latency and the stability are flawless. It's still not 100% perfect, and I had to unpair/pair my Glove80 once, but even that is very easy with the Magic key.\n\nSo which one to choose? Except for the design, premium build, and heft, I\nthink the Glove80 excels in every area. If you're using a Kinesis, it might be\nworth checking out the Glove80, and you'll not regret it.\n\nKinesis should release a new keyboard that covers all these pain points. They\nknow how to quality keyboards, but I can say that Glove80 stole the show. As\nit should be. Combined with the Discord community, with the CEO listening to\ncustomers and being on top of all issues, I think the Glove80 deserves high\npraise here.\n\n## Verdict\n\nMoErgo, the company behind Glove80, researched this area well. They looked at\nother keyboards, checked what was missing, and improved on several sides. They\ncreated an ergonomic, wireless, easy-to-use split keyboard that rivals other\nkeyboards in this area. If you're looking to get one, look no further.\n\nThanks for reading so far.
