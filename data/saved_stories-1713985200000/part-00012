Among the documents he gathered to support his thesis was the\n> personal account of a sailor by the name of Gustaf Johansen, describing an\n> encounter with an extraordinary island. Johansen`s descriptions of his\n> adventures upon the island are fantastic, and are often considered the most\n> enigmatic (and therefore the highlight) of Thurston`s collection of\n> documents. We contend that all of the credible phenomena which Johansen\n> described may be explained as being the observable consequences of a\n> localized bubble of spacetime curvature. Many of his most incomprehensible\n> statements (involving the geometry of the architecture, and variability of\n> the location of the horizon) can therefore be said to have a unified\n> underlying cause. We propose a simplified example of such a geometry, and\n> show using numerical computation that Johansen`s descriptions were, for the\n> most part, not simply the ravings of a lunatic. Rather, they are the\n> nontechnical observations of an intelligent man who did not understand how\n> to describe what he was seeing. Conversely, it seems to us improbable that\n> Johansen should have unwittingly given such a precise description of the\n> consequences of spacetime curvature, if the details of this story were\n> merely the dregs of some half remembered fever dream. We calculate the type\n> of matter which would be required to generate such exotic spacetime\n> curvature. Unfortunately, we determine that the required matter is quite\n> unphysical, and possess a nature which is entirely alien to all of the\n> experiences of human science. Indeed, any civilization with mastery over\n> such matter would be able to construct warp drives, cloaking devices, and\n> other exotic geometries required to conveniently travel through the cosmos.\n\nComments:| 13 pages, 10 figures.
