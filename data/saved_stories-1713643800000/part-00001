That includes the five states with the highest rates of\nunsheltered people. There are many reasons for this, from patterns of poverty\nand drug addiction to the benign weather in California \u2014 68 percent of whose\n181,000 homeless people were unsheltered, more than any other state. A little-\nknown but crucial factor, however, is that all these states are under the\njurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, whose unique\nlegal doctrine has effectively barred most enforcement of local public camping\nbans.\n\nThough started with good intentions \u2014 to prevent \u201ccriminalization\u201d of poverty\nand to incentivize cities to offer shelters \u2014 the 9th Circuit approach has\nshown itself to be counterproductive. Without a credible threat of sanctions\nagainst public camping, officials have little leverage to induce people to\ntake shelter beds when they are available. Arguably, this has undermined\nquality of life not only for those who live or work near unsafe encampments\nbut also for the homeless people themselves.\n\nThat\u2019s why a broad bipartisan coalition including leaders from big blue cities\nand small red towns in the 9th Circuit, and elsewhere, is begging the Supreme\nCourt to rule in favor of Grants Pass, Ore., a small city in the south of the\nstate whose civil fines for public camping were invalidated last year by the\n9th Circuit. Oral argument is Monday, and we, too, hope the justices side with\nGrants Pass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe 9th Circuit\u2019s position is that a city can penalize public camping but only\nwhen there are enough beds in suitable shelters inside the city limits to\naccommodate everyone who is \u201cinvoluntarily\u201d homeless. Otherwise, it is guilty\nof cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of the Eighth Amendment. However\ngood this might sound in theory, in practice, the 9th Circuit and its\ncomponent district courts have defined the terms of acceptable shelter so\nnarrowly and confusingly that few places can comply.\n\nFederal judges shouldn\u2019t be in the business of issuing injunctions while\nassessing the quantity and quality of shelters. Phoenix, in a friend-of-the-\ncourt brief supporting Grants Pass, said judges are acting \u201cas homeless policy\nczars\u201d rather than \u201capplying discernible rules of law.\u201d Compounding the\nproblem is the 9th Circuit\u2019s notion that shelters operated by church groups\nmay not count as available space because a faith-based milieu can create a\npossible unconstitutional establishment of religion. Grants Pass ran afoul of\nthis remarkable requirement because 138 of its beds were at the Gospel Rescue\nMission.\n\nTo read the Oregon town\u2019s brief, and those of its supporters at the Supreme\nCourt, is to marvel at the gap between the 9th Circuit\u2019s vision and the real-\nworld damage that comes from federal-court supervision of this traditionally\nlocal responsibility. In Grants Pass, people camping by the Rogue River use it\nfor bathing, as a bathroom and for drinking water. Last May, one homeless man\nkilled another in a park. The bigger the city, the bigger the problems. San\nFrancisco saw more than 800 fires started by people cooking or warming\nthemselves in homeless encampments last year. Diseases have spread, along with\ndangerous waste such as discarded syringes and needles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nA brief from California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) acknowledged that people\nshouldn\u2019t be punished for sleeping outside when they genuinely lack an\nalternative but noted that the 9th Circuit has left local officials \u201ctrapped,\nat risk of suit for taking action but also accountable for the consequences of\ninaction.\u201d He also remarked on the contradictory fact that a federal agency,\nthe National Park Service, could clear a homeless encampment in McPherson\nSquare, federal property near the White House, but that communities in his\nstate cannot.\n\nThe framers of the Eighth Amendment adapted it from the English Declaration of\nRights, whose drafters, in turn, were responding to the barbarism of King\nJames II. The original intent was to prevent punishments like branding,\nburning at the stake, public dissection, or drawing and quartering. The\nSupreme Court updated this in 1958 to allow for \u201cthe evolving standards of\ndecency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\u201d\n\nThroughout history, however, courts generally distinguished between society\u2019s\npower to impose consequences for unlawful conduct, which the Eighth Amendment\nregulated, and society\u2019s power to define unlawful conduct, which it does not.\nIn this instance, the 9th Circuit blurred that basic distinction. Fortunately,\nthe Supreme Court can help restore order, to constitutional law and to parks,\nstreets and sidewalks across the West.\n\n### The Post\u2019s View | About the Editorial Board\n\nEditorials represent the views of The Post as an institution, as determined\nthrough discussion among members of the Editorial Board, based in the Opinions\nsection and separate from the newsroom.\n\nMembers of the Editorial Board: Opinion Editor David Shipley, Deputy Opinion\nEditor Charles Lane and Deputy Opinion Editor Stephen Stromberg, as well as\nwriters Mary Duenwald, Shadi Hamid, David E.
