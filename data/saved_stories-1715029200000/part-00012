It\u2019s not a lie, but, in reality, the three-legged\nstool (or Venn diagram showing viability, feasibility, and desirability) of\ninnovation is a barely adequate metaphor to communicate a specific message.\nTherein lies the rub: it\u2019s only apt for a very specific message.\n\nI first discovered this breakdown when I came across a LinkedIn post by Pavel\nSamsonov where he dives deeper into the metaphor to identify how these\nelements truly play out. At the time, this resonated with me because I was in\nthe middle of a project where the team struggled to gain traction. Pavel\u2019s\nexplanation had serious merit in providing a way for us to understand our\nstruggles. So, to better clarify things for myself, I explored it further and\nconducted my own thought experiment exercise. The rest of this post is the\nresult.\n\n## The IKEA manual for the three-legged stool of innovation.\n\nIf I had to summarize the foundation of Pavel\u2019s message, it is that, in\nactuality, the balanced viability, feasibility, and desirability metaphor is\nbetter represented as a semi-linear flow. In other words, it\u2019s a mature\nprocess constantly moving between the problem, solution, and delivery space.\nBut, for the sake of this post, I\u2019m calling it linear. So it\u2019s more like an\nIKEA assembly manual for the stool. You need to understand what information\ncomes first to reach valuable outcomes.\n\nFeasibility is actually further down the flow than viability. But, more\nimportantly, we must understand that viability is informed by the overlap of\ndesirability and priority. Priority is what the business wants to achieve.\nNothing is \u201cviable\u201d until it solves a business problem.\n\nAt this point, I started to translate the idea into something that fits more\nnaturally into my own mental model. Namely, that was organizing the flow into\nspaces: the problem space, the solution space, and the delivery space.\n\n## The Problem Space\n\nThis is the area where we\u2019re working to identify viability. We\u2019re building an\nunderstanding of the various impact areas so we can decide what to work on.\nRemember that Pavel stated viability is the overlap of priority and\ndesirability.\n\nThis is an important distinction, because, if the business doesn\u2019t have a\nclear strategy for what it is trying to achieve, we\u2019re left struggling to\ndefine true viability. Businesses without strategy end up with vague metrics\ndisguised as viability. In turn, this leads teams to moving into the solution\nspace, trying to solve for better NPS scores. The cost of this deficit is that\nteams should use the business\u2019s strategy to guide what customer problems they\nwant to try and solve. Without a strong priority, teams must guess and might\nchoose to solve customer problems that won\u2019t ultimately deliver real value.\n\n## The Solution Space\n\nIdentifying a viable approach is our transition into the solution space. This\nis where we can identify a range of potential solutions before running them\nthrough our feasibility filter.\n\nAt this stage, we\u2019re developing a host of hypotheses for how to solve the\ncustomer\u2019s needs in a way that will deliver business outcomes. An effective\nhypothesis will have a belief statement for what we want to test, a\nverification plan for how it will be tested, and a measure so everyone is\naligned on which hypotheses are successful. When we have our list of\nhypotheses it\u2019s now time to run them through our feasibility filter. This is\noften informed by the original business priority because, as Pavel says, \u201cIf\nthe expected ROI is high enough, we are willing to fund lots of things that\nseem infeasible.\u201d\n\n## The Delivery Space\n\nThis is where prioritized hypotheses begin to be clarified, built, and\nreleased. You\u2019d usually do this by breaking down the hypothesis into testable,\nbuildable, and deliverable slices.\n\nWhen we use the three-legged stool of innovation metaphor flippantly, without\na deeper understanding of how the process breaks down, we risk underselling or\nblatantly misdirecting the audience we\u2019re communicating with.\n\ninnovationProduct Developmentdesign strategy\n\nMatthew Smith Software Consultant & Designer at Atomic Object, Grand Rapids.\nAlways asking questions.
