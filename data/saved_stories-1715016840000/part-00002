It is commonly\nused in web applications to enable users to find specific content or\ninformation. The search input is typically accompanied by a search button or\nicon to initiate the search process or it simply starts the search\nautomatically when the user types in the query. Like this one.\n\nUse cases:\n\n  * Product search: A search input can be used to search for products in a database or search engine.\n  * File search: A search input can be used to search for files in a directory or file system.\n  * Document search: A search input can be used to search for documents in a database or search engine.\n  * Data search: A search input can be used to search for data in a database or search engine.\n\n### Let\u2019s get started\n\nThis is the structure of the project: Understanding the code:\n\n  * x-data=\"{ searchQuery: '', items: [...] }\": This is the data that will be used to store the state of the search input and the list of items to be filtered.\n  * <input type=\"text\" x-model=\"searchQuery\" placeholder=\"Search...\">: This is the search input.\n  * <template x-for=\"item in items\" :key=\"item.name\">: This is the template that will be used to render each item in the list.\n  * <li x-show=\"item.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase())\" x-text=\"item.name\">: This is the condition that will be used to filter the items based on the search query.\n\n    \n    \n    <div x-data=\"{ searchQuery: '', items: [ 'Milano', 'Alicante', 'Switzerland', 'Bilbao', '\u00c5land Islands', 'Stockholm', 'Torrevieja', 'Minneapolis' ].map(item => ({ name: item })) }\"> <!-- Search Input --> <input type=\"text\" x-model=\"searchQuery\" placeholder=\"Search...\" /> <!-- Filtered Items --> <ul > <template x-for=\"item in items\" :key=\"item.name\"> <li x-show=\"item.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase())\" x-text=\"item.name\"> </li> </template> </ul> </div>\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis is a simple search input that can be used to filter a list of items based\non a search query. It\u2019s a great way to enhance the user experience and make it\neasier for users to find the information they\u2019re looking for. Remember to add\nsome acceesibility features to make it accessible to all users, such as adding\na label to the search input and providing a clear button to initiate the\nsearch process and so on.\n\nHope you enjoyed this tutorial and have a great day!\n\nDid you like this tutorial?
