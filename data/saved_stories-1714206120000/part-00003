These are the Zones\nrouges\u2014an archipelago of former battlegrounds so pockmarked and polluted by\nwar that, more than a century after the end of hostilities, they remain unfit\nto live or even farm on.\n\nWWI was the first industrial war and a laboratory for all kinds of military\ninnovations, including the first use of tanks and poison gas. Both the German\nand the Allied war machines belched out deadly explosives and lethal chemicals\non a massive scale. It is estimated that around 60 million shells rained down\nnear Verdun during the fierce battles over that city in 1916\u2014of which 15\nmillion didn\u2019t explode upon impact.\n\nFour years of war stripped a zone on either side of the largely immobile\nfrontline of any sign of life. Roads and bridges, canals and railways were\ndestroyed. Cities were pummeled into dust. Entire villages \u201cdied for France\u201d\nand were wiped off the map for good.\n\nATLAS OBSCURA COURSES\n\nLearn with Us!\n\nCheck out our lineup of courses taught by world-class experts from around the\nworld.

Frank Hurley/Public Domain\n\nBombardments were so thorough that even grass and trees disappeared. When the\nwar ended in November 1918, a large swathe of northern to eastern France was\nso cratered up and chewed out that it looked like a moonscape. In all, about 7\npercent of French territory was destroyed during the war, in a zone stretching\nover 4,000 municipalities across 13 departments, from the Nord at the coast to\nthe Bas-Rhin on the Swiss border.\n\nBy 1919, the French Ministry for the Liberated Territories had divided the\nafflicted areas into three zones, depending on the degree of destruction:\n\n  * Zones vertes (\u201cGreen Zones\u201d), with minimal damage;\n  * Zones jaunes (\u201cYellow Zones\u201d), with heavy but limited damage; and\n  * Zones rouges (\u201cRed Zones\u201d), usually closest to the former front lines, which were completely destroyed.\n\nThe primary task was to clear the affected areas of ammunition and corpses.\nThis involved the efforts of German PoWs, foreign workers from as far afield\nas China, and Quaker volunteers, among others.\n\nMassive amounts of unidentified human remains were gathered in places like the\nDouaumont Ossuary, the last resting place of 130,000 German and French\nsoldiers who fell at Verdun. Soldier bones continue to turn up. As recently as\nApril 2012, authorities were able to identify the remains of a French soldier\nnamed Albert Dadure.\n\nRed zones are completely devastated, with contaminated water, crops, soil, and\nanimals. Tinodela/Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 Generic\n\nThe green and yellow zones were returned to civilian use relatively early. The\nred zones were different. They were, in the words of one official post-war\nreport, \u201ccompletely devastated. Damage to properties: 100%. Damage to\nagriculture: 100%. Impossible to clean. Human life impossible.\u201d Red zones were\ncleared only superficially, and mostly just closed off.\n\nIn 1919, these red zones covered around 690 square miles (1,800 kilometers\nsquared). Here, the ground remained saturated with unexploded ordnance. High\nconcentrations of heavy metals and chemicals in the soil further increased the\nrisk to life and limb. For reasons of safety and sanitation, these areas were\nstrictly off-limits for housing, farming, and even forestry.\n\nBy 1927, the red zones had been reduced by 70 percent to around 190 square\nmiles (490 kilometers squared), in part due to pressure from local farmers,\nwho wanted to return their fields and pastures to productivity and profit.\n\nToday, the red zone archipelago has shrunk to about 40 square miles (100\nkilometers squared), about the size of Paris. Yet it\u2019s unlikely that these\nislands will disappear soon. They are the most tenacious residue of a long-\nlasting environmental problem.\n\nEach year, farmers in former red zones plough up an \u201ciron harvest\u201d of close to\n900 tons of unexploded ordnance. Near Verdun, road signs point to dumping\ngrounds where they can leave these shells for the authorities to collect.\n\nFrance\u2019s S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Civile, which is charged with removing them, estimates that\nat current rates, it could take up to 700 years to completely clear all\nremaining WWI shells and grenades from France\u2019s soil.\n\nVerdun Forest is an area that had restoration after World War I. F.\nLamiot/Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 Generic\n\nAnd then there are the gases, acids, and other chemicals polluting the soil\u2014in\nsome parts, the ground still contains so much arsenic that nothing will grow.\nIn less affected areas, biologists still note the lack of floral and faunal\ndiversity related to the pollution, which some estimate may take about 10,000\nyears to clear.\n\nWWI was supposed to be the \u201cWar to End All War.\u201d That went... less well than\ncould have been hoped for. One of the lessons not learned from that conflict\nis that modern wars have long-lasting impacts on health and the environment.\nThe issue has remained largely dormant, resurfacing only in the 1990s, when\nmore than one in three U.S. veterans of the First Gulf War reported a range of\nsymptoms ascribed to exposure to toxic substances.\n\nEven in France itself, not much thought is given to the lingering effects of\nWWI, or to the remaining Zones rouges\u2014perhaps because so much of the affected\nareas were left to the trees, becoming so-called for\u00eats de guerre (war\nforests), notably in the Champagne region. Yet the invisible environmental\nlegacy of the Great War has very real consequences.\n\n  * In 2012, the consumption of locally sourced drinking water was prohibited in 544 municipalities, due to high levels of perchlorate, which was used to make WWI ammo. All of those municipalities are located close to former battlefield zones.\n  * Experts warn that mushrooms, game meat, and even food cooked over wood collected in red zones or former red zones might be a source of toxins.\n  * It has been established that the livers of wild boars roaming the forests around Verdun contain abnormally high levels of lead.\n  * And the relatively elevated levels of lead in certain French wines may result from the wood of the barrels in which they matured, from oak harvested in former red zones.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Big Think, home of the brightest minds and\nbiggest ideas of all time.
