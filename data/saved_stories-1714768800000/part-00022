Now, an unlikely cohort is feeling his wrath:\nTesla\u2019s summer interns. College students shared how Musk\u2019s cost-cutting\nefforts imploded their summer plans, first reported by Bloomberg Wednesday.\n\n#### Related Content\n\nElon Musk's Battle with Swedish Unions Is Now Impacting Tesla's Charging\nStations\n\nTesla's Fix for the Cybertruck's Defective Gas Pedal Is to Just Bolt It On\n\nTesla Investors Not Happy With Mr. Tweet's Tweets\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nview video\n\nTesla Investors Not Happy With Mr. Tweet's Tweets\n\n\u201cI will no longer be interning at Tesla this summer,\u201d said one North Carolina\nState University student on LinkedIn Thursday, who posted a month earlier that\nhe\u2019d received an offer. \u201cAfter a single phone call of less than two minutes,\nmy entire plan for this summer had vanished as if it had never even existed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nElon Musk's Battle with Swedish Unions Is Now Impacting Tesla's Charging\nStations\n\nTesla's Fix for the Cybertruck's Defective Gas Pedal Is to Just Bolt It On\n\nTesla Investors Not Happy With Mr. Tweet's Tweets\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nTesla Investors Not Happy With Mr. Tweet's Tweets\n\n\u201cWhile I was in the middle of finals, I got an unexpected message,\u201d said\nanother post from an incoming Tesla intern, who also posted months earlier\nabout receiving an offer. \u201cThe timing couldn\u2019t have been worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was only a couple of weeks ago that I received my offer to intern with\nTesla starting this May,\u201d said another post. \u201cI was recently informed that my\ninternship offer was being rescinded due to the company\u2019s #masslayoffs.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese LinkedIn posts, and several others, tell a painful story about the human\nconsequences of Tesla\u2019s cost-cutting efforts. Tesla\u2019s Summer 2024 intern class\nwas supposed to start in just weeks, as many students finished up final exams\nat colleges around the country. These students say they had already made\nhousing accommodations, booked flights, and turned down other offers to work\nthe summer at Musk\u2019s car company. Tesla accepts more than 3,000 college\nstudents as interns every year, according to its 2022 Impact Report.\n\nThe dissolution of Tesla\u2019s intern program is part of broader layoffs at the\ncompany. Musk laid off the entire 500-person team operating Tesla\u2019s\nSupercharger Network this week. The group was reportedly reassured days\nearlier by a senior executive that Musk thought their team was critical to the\ncompany. Last month, Tesla announced 14,000 employees would be laid off after\na dark earnings report revealed disappointing car sales.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTesla interns make roughly $35 an hour, according to employee-reported data\ncompiled by Indeed. They\u2019re likely the lowest-paid employees at the company,\nso it\u2019s unclear how much Tesla will really save by cutting them. Their removal\nis more likely a sign of Musk\u2019s latest attitude change at Tesla, recently\nsaying that all staff would need to \u201cpass the excellent, necessary and\ntrustworthy test,\u201d in a memo viewed by The Information.\n\nTesla has given itself a tall task in the coming months. The company needs to\nmake progress on new, cheaper EV models while also preparing a new robotaxi\nfor an August showcase. Meanwhile, Musk continues to push his autonomous\ndriving efforts, which are increasingly becoming a necessary part of Tesla\u2019s\nfuture business model. Musk appears to hope that a small team of hardworking\nemployees will get the job done, but apparently, that does not include the\nsummer interns.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
