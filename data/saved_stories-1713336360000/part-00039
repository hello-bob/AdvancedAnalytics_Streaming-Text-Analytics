The work, carried out by UK-based researchers,\ncould offer a more sustainable alternative to traditional leather and the\nassociated chemical dyeing processes.\n\n\u2018By 2050, after food and construction, materials for textiles and fabrics will\nbe the third biggest polluter in the world \u2013 fashion and textiles already\ncontribute more to carbon emissions than all of aviation and shipping\ncombined,\u2019 explains Tom Ellis, a synthetic biologist at Imperial College\nLondon who led the project. \u2018In terms of carbon use, by far the worst material\nused in the fashion industry, is leather \u2013 the amount of land use and CO_2 and\nmethane emissions associated with farming cows and then producing leather is\ncrazy.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Then on top of that, dying leather a different colour and cleaning it in a\nway that it becomes the material you want is also terrible,\u2019 he adds. \u2018The\ntanning process uses chromium and to get that black colour \u2013 the most popular\ncolour for leather \u2013 you have to use azo dyes and that creates a huge amount\nof wastewater and chemical residue.\u2019\n\nTo find a solution, the researchers turned to bacterial cellulose, a natural\nbiomaterial that has been considered as an alternative to leather for over a\ndecade. The Imperial team\u2019s unique approach involved genetically engineering\nKomagataeibacter rhaeticus (K. rhaeticus) bacteria to express tyrosinase-\nrelated protein 1 \u2013 a gene associated with the production of the melanin\npigment eumelanin. This produced a bacterial strain that grows self-pigmenting\nbacterial cellulose.\n\nSource: \u00a9 Imperial College London\n\n\u2018Nature tells us that if you make a pigmented molecule in the same place at\nthe same time as when you are making a material, those pigment molecules get\nsucked up and are incorporated as part of the material,\u2019 Ellis says. \u2018So why\ncan\u2019t we just put the DNA that encodes the enzymes that make a pigment into\nthe same cells that are making the material through genetic engineering?\u2019\n\nTo demonstrate that eumelanin production could effectively pigment the\ncellulose produced by the genetically modified K. rhaeticus, the researchers\nfirst grew the bacteria under normal growth conditions for two weeks to\nproduce a cellulose mesh known as a pellicle. They then removed the spent\nculture media and replaced it with a neutral buffer solution with the reagents\nrequired for eumelanin synthesis. After one day of incubation in the\ndevelopment buffer, the cellulose pellicle had turned completely black.\n\nSource: \u00a9 Imperial College London\n\nThis shoe upper was made by wrapping the treated bacterial cellulose around a\nfoot-shaped mould\n\nThe team produced a shoe upper by soaking the material in a glycerol solution\nto give it the required flexibility, before wrapping it around a foot-shaped\nmould and allowing it to dry. They also created a wallet prototype from two\npressed and dried melanated bacterial cellulose sheets.\n\n\u2018What was really cool was the colour just doesn\u2019t fade \u2013 you can put water on\nit, scrape it - it\u2019s much more colourfast than we thought we would get,\u2019 Ellis\nsays, adding that the process could, in theory, be adapted to have bacteria\ngrow materials in various vibrant colours and patterns.\n\n\u2018What we would like to do next is crosslinking \u2013 that\u2019s what really makes\nleather have this nice feel and the ability for it to last 20 years.\nCrosslinking is normally done by chromium and other very harsh methods so it\u2019d\nbe really nice to find a biological solution to that,\u2019 he adds.\n\nThe researchers note that as high yields of the material can be produced from\nsimple static growth cultures, the method should be \u2018very amenable to scale-\nup\u2019.\n\n\u2018This work is an elegant demonstration of the power of biofabrication and\ngenetic tool kits to map nature\u2019s strategies to develop advanced materials,\u2019\nsays Theanne Schiros, who works as a materials scientist at both the Fashion\nInstitute of Technology at the State University of New York and Columbia\nUniversity, both US. \u2018It provides important context for exciting opportunities\nto expand the functionality of emerging biomaterials and future textiles,\u2019 she\nadds.\n\n### References\n\nK T Walker et al, Nat.
