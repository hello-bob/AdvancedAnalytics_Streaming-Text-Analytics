I can log into a game like Fortnite, party up with a squad and\nchat in either the game\u2019s built-in voice protocol or use another service like\nDiscord, and be in a game within minutes. I can do this from my computer, a\ngame console, or even my phone. But before the wide availability of high-speed\ninternet, things were more complicated.\n\nThe following is excerpted from the book LAN Party, by Merritt K. The book is\navailable for purchase now.\n\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, three-dimensional graphics in videogames were\nbecoming more and more complex. Titles like 1998\u2019s Half-Life pushed games in\nmore cinematic directions, with lighting and textures that went beyond\nanything released even a few years earlier. Other first-person shooters (FPS)\nlike Counter-Strike (itself originally a mod for Half-Life) and Unreal\nTournament built on the work of earlier titles like DOOM, Wolfenstein 3D, and\nDuke Nukem 3D. Many of these titles were designed for multiplayer action.\nHowever, the typically low network speeds of the period meant that these\ngames, unlike slower-paced and less graphically intensive strategy games, were\nnearly unplayable over an internet connection. In this moment, in which\ncommunications technology was being outpaced by graphical power, the LAN\n(local area network) party was born.\n\nThe term itself conjures up strong sensory memories for those who were\nthere\u2014sweaty bodies packed into a basement or convention hall, a dozen CPUs\nnoticeably warming the space, the heft of a CRT monitor being maneuvered into\nposition. For those on the outside, these were scenes of incomprehension or\nridicule. But for those who were there, the LAN party was a singular event, a\ndefining social occasion of the early 21st century. It represented the last\ngasps of the isolated gamer stereotype, ushering in an age in which gaming was\nnot only mainstream, but a social, networked activity.\n\nOf course, people had been bringing together computers for some time prior to\nthe Y2K era. (The demoparty, in which participants cracked code to evade\ncopyright protection and share artistic creations, was an important antecedent\nto the LAN party.) But it was in this particular period\u2014in the United States,\nat least\u2014that the social and technological configuration of the LAN party\nbecame a true phenomenon. Participants hauled their monitors, towers, and\nperipherals to a central location, where they would set up their machines and\nconnect them through a network switch. This local connection enabled speeds\nfar beyond those available to the average internet user, enabling lag-free\ngameplay, not to mention high-speed file sharing at a time when downloading or\ntransporting large files could be an extremely onerous task.\n\nLAN parties ranged from small, private gatherings to massive, multi-day events\nwith thousands of participants, such as QuakeCon, DreamHack, The Gathering,\nand Euskal Encounter. Both types are represented in this book, though the\nfocus is more on the former. As accessible digital photography was emerging\naround the same time as LAN parties\u2014and perhaps because computer enthusiasts\nwere more likely than the general population to own gadgets like digital\ncameras\u2014these events are extraordinarily well documented.\n\n###### Gaming at the Turn of the Millennium\n\nWhat do these photos show? Young people\u2014primarily young men\u2014goofing off and\nplaying games, of course. But it\u2019s more than that. Technological and cultural\nartifacts of the era are strewn throughout, illustrating trends, obsessions,\nand now-forgotten relics. One of my favorite photos in the book depicts, among\nother things: a Windows XP error dialogue box; a beige Microsoft keyboard; a\ndisposable film camera; a pair of wraparound headphones that I and nearly\neveryone else I knew owned in the early 2000s; and a pile of burned CD-Rs, one\nof which has \u201cStarCraft\u201d written on it in permanent marker. Junk foods and\ncaffeinated beverages appear frequently in the collection, with the energy\ndrink Bawls Guarana in particular popping up again and again. While Mountain\nDew has since acquired a reputation as the gamer beverage of choice, Bawls was\ncertainly the unofficial sponsoring drink of the LAN party.\n\nSome games feature prominently in the mythos of the LAN party and in the\nphotos collected in this book. The aforementioned Counter-Strike and Unreal\nTournament are two of them, being primarily team-based first-person shooters\nthat laid the groundwork for the ongoing popularity of the genre. These games\nare best played with minimum latency; they each support large numbers of\nplayers and feature quick rounds, which made them big hits at LAN parties.\nCertain maps in these games have become iconic, celebrated and recreated in\nother titles\u2014for Counter-Strike, Dust II (de_dust2) is probably the best-\nknown, while for Unreal Tournament, it\u2019s Facing Worlds (CTF-Face). Both of\nthese maps are so significant, so well-remembered and influential that they\nhave their own Wikipedia pages.\n\nOther first-person shooters popular at turn-of-the-century LAN parties include\nStarsiege: Tribes, Tom Clancy\u2019s Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear, and id\u2019s Quake\nseries. Quake III Arena was released in 1999 and eschewed a single-player\nnarrative component, instead focusing on highspeed multiplayer battles. The\nengine developed for the game was later used for a number of other successful\ngames, including the awkwardly titled Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast,\nwhich contained a robust multiplayer mode that players built on by creating\nelaborate rituals around lightsaber duels.\n\nOf course, not all of the games played at LAN parties were first-person\nshooters. Real-time strategy (RTS) games were also quite popular in the early\n2000s, with Blizzard\u2019s StarCraft (1998) and Warcraft III : Reign of Chaos\n(2002) celebrated for their intricate design, customizability, and multiplayer\ncapabilities. These games, like many 3FPS games of the era, came with tools\nthat made it easy for players to create their own content. This led to a boom\nin hobbyist developer creativity that in turn generated entirely new genres of\nvideogames such as the multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA), later refined\nby immensely successful titles like League of Legends and Dota 2. Other well-\nloved RTS games of the era include Westwood\u2019s Command & Conquer franchise,\nEnsemble\u2019s Age of Empires series, and Creative Assembly\u2019s Total War titles.\n\nWhen it came to console gaming in the Y2K era, the Nintendo 64 set a new\nstandard for multiplayer games with the introduction of four controller ports\nin 1996, and most subsequent machines followed its lead. Microsoft released\nthe original Xbox in 2001, and its launch title, Halo: Combat Evolved, kicked\noff a new generation of console-based first-person shooters. In addition to\nfeaturing split-screen multiplayer, the Xbox supported a form of LAN play\ncalled System Link, which allowed up to sixteen players to play games like\nHalo simultaneously. The Halo series and Xbox also happened to be instrumental\nin the decline of the LAN party\u2014more on that later.\n\nPg 26: \u00a9 Erwin de Gier Amsterdam (The Netherlands), 1998\n\n###### Y2K Cultural Trends\n\nBeyond games, LAN party photos also demonstrate some other cultural trends of\nthe period. The late 90s and early 2000s saw the rise of the nu metal musical\ngenre, which included artists like Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, Korn, and Linkin\nPark. These groups harnessed feelings of isolation and teenage angst and fused\nrock instrumentation with hip-hop style and delivery, creating a kind of music\nthat was beloved and reviled in equal measure for its direct, unselfconscious\nemotional pleas, macho posturing, and nihilistic themes.\n\nSimultaneously, anime and Japanese subcultures were becoming more popular in\nthe US due to the introduction of shows like Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon on\nAmerican children\u2019s networks. The growth of the internet, too, was making it\neasier than ever for young people interested in anime and other niche topics\nto share their interests and learn more about them on message boards and\nwebrings. Anime and nu metal often went together in the form of the animated\nmusic video (AMV), where fans would stitch together clips of their favorite\nshows as makeshift music videos for their favorite angsty tracks.\n\nThe influence of anime and nu metal, as well as the mainstreaming of hip-hop\nto white suburban audiences, the dark guns-and-leather aesthetics of the films\nBlade and The Matrix, skater culture, and more can be seen in many of the\nphotos in this book\u2014in the clothing people are wearing, the posters on their\nwalls, and desktop backgrounds. What has today become massively\nmainstream\u2014anime, gaming, comic books, and so on\u2014was, in the early 2000s,\nstill on the fringes of normalcy. Remember: Iron Man didn\u2019t kick off the\nMarvel Cinematic Universe until 2008. Crunchyroll, the anime streaming\nplatform, didn\u2019t exist until 2006.\n\nIn the same vein, this period also saw the birth of meme culture online. Early\ninternet memes like \u201cMr. T Ate My Balls,\u201d \u201cAll your base are belong to us,\u201d\nand l33tspeak spread through forums like Something Awful and Flash portals\nsuch as Newgrounds, giving young internet users a kind of shared secret\nlanguage. In the late 2000s, as social networks like Facebook gained traction\namong college students and more and more people got online, meme culture\ngradually became mass culture.\n\n###### Creative Chaos\n\nIn addition to the cultural trends of the time, these pictures also show\npeople bringing computers into places where they didn\u2019t traditionally belong.\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, bulky desktop computers often lived in home\noffices or even dedicated \u201ccomputer rooms.\u201d Some lucky few kids at that time\nhad their own personal computers in their bedrooms, but in my experience, this\nwas rare.\n\nDuring LAN parties, participants brought computers into garages, basements,\nliving rooms, and other spaces, setting them up on dining-room tables, TV\ntrays, kitchen counters, and any available surface. The raw excitement on the\npart of the participants is evident in the sometimes absurd lengths they went\nto in order to participate in LAN parties\u2014computer towers crammed between\ncushions in the back seat of a van to ensure their safe transportation across\ntown; cables crisscrossing the floor to connect machines; CRT monitors\nbalanced haphazardly around the room.\n\nIt\u2019s this passion, I think, which partly explains the appeal of these\nphotos\u2014even to those who weren\u2019t around at the time. This book is full of\nimages of people being truly excited about computers and playing games on\nthem. There\u2019s a sense, in looking at these photos, that these people were on\nthe cusp of something\u2014even if they weren\u2019t necessarily aware of it at the\ntime. Since the home computer boom of the 1990s and the introduction of high-\nspeed internet in the 2000s, the omnipresence of computers and communication\ntechnology has rendered them mundane to many people. It\u2019s almost quaint to see\npeople so genuinely thrilled to be playing PC games with their friends when,\ntoday, doing so is an everyday occurrence.\n\nMaking a LAN party happen took work. It took physical effort, technical know-\nhow, and a willingness to hack things together. The range of computer\nequipment depicted in the photos is testament to that. Yes, there are the\nstandard massive, beige CRT monitors associated with the period, but we see\ncomputer towers ranging from stock models in the same color to complex\nmonstrosities built by enthusiastic geeks. This was before Apple\u2019s sleek\nindustrial design took over the tech world, before LED lights were standard on\npretty much any gaming PC. It was the era of user-driven customization, and\nLAN parties are perfectly emblematic of that time.\n\n###### The Decline Of The LAN Party\n\nLAN parties occurred throughout the 1990s, peaked (in the US, at least) in the\nearly-mid-2000s and began to decline in the early 2010s. Of course, people do\nstill throw LAN parties, especially people who grew up with them, but their\nheyday has long since passed. So what killed the LAN party? The most obvious\nanswer is the widespread introduction of communication infrastructure that\nmade it possible to play games like first-person shooters over the internet\nwith low latency.\n\nLAN parties were a creation of circumstance, which withered away once it was\nno longer a necessity to transport computers to the same physical space in\norder to get an ideal gaming experience. It\u2019s certainly true that it is now\nmore convenient than ever for many people to play games online with strangers\nor friends. But convenience in technology often comes with a commensurate loss\nof control on the part of users.\n\nIn 2004, Bungie released Halo 2 for the Xbox. The game built on the original\u2019s\nlandmark success by introducing online play through Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Live\nservice. It went on to become the most popular Xbox Live title of all time and\nwas played until the discontinuation of the service on the original Xbox in\n2010.\n\nPgs 70-71: \u00a9 Kiel Oleson/Electronox Lee\u2019s Summit, MO (USA), 2002\n\nThe Xbox Live service was easy to use, popularizing the method of allowing\nplayers to party up with their friends and enter into matchmaking queues. This\nwas a major shift from the then prevalent system of presenting players with a\nlist of servers to join, each hosted by different players and groups. As well\nas being a more seamless experience emphasizing ease of use, this new model\nalso represented a move away from user control. Matchmaking is now the\ndominant mode of playing multiplayer games online. There are certainly\nadvantages inherent in it\u2014developers can try to create fairer matchups based\non skill and players can keep their ranks and reputations across games\u2014but it\nalso puts players at the mercy of a company\u2019s algorithms and servers.\n\nMany of the most popular multiplayer videogames today are entirely server-\nside, meaning that they cannot be played without connecting to the game\u2019s\nservers. This is advantageous for developers and publishers, who can ensure\nthat players have the latest updates, prevent cheating, and create large\nworlds in which numerous players can be online and interacting at once. But it\nalso means that control of game experiences has shifted significantly away\nfrom users. Even games that have offline components often do not have any kind\nof peer-to-peer or private server functionality, meaning that it is impossible\nfor a group to play them together in a LAN environment.\n\nThe way we buy and play games has also changed. Today, digital platforms like\nSteam and the Epic Game Store allow players to purchase titles without leaving\ntheir homes. But digital copies of games, and their management through these\nplatforms, mean that the old practices of burning copies of games or sharing\nlegal \u201cspawn installations\u201d of games to facilitate multiplayer experiences are\nless and less possible.\n\nThus, the story that LAN parties died because they were simply an obsolete\nsocial structure is a little too straightforward. It may be true that most\npeople would prefer to play games in the comfort of their own home rather than\ntransporting expensive and bulky equipment elsewhere, but technological and\neconomic forces also contributed to the decline of LAN events. The fact is\nthat the shift to digital, producer-owned environments in every aspect of\ngaming\u2014from sales to play\u2014tremendously benefits the corporations publishing\nand selling games, sometimes at the expense of those purchasing and playing\nthem.\n\n###### Looking Back\n\nIn the photos collected in this book, then, we can see some things that have\nbeen lost, or at least forgotten\u2014an adventurous spirit around computing and a\nworld in which ownership of software and play belonged more to individuals\nthan corporations. I don\u2019t mean to suggest that LAN parties were utopian\nspaces. They were, of course, mostly\u2014but certainly not exclusively\u2014attended\nand organized by young white men, and even many of the larger events were\nmale-dominated spaces, hostile to women. Nonetheless, from my position,\ndecades later, I can\u2019t help but look fondly on images of LAN parties. At a\ntime when communications technology paradoxically seems to produce a sense of\ndisconnection for many people through algorithmically generated echo chambers\nand the indexing of personal worth to follower counts or likes, seeing people\nliterally coming together with and around computers is almost aspirational.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to see the mainstreaming of gaming and tech as a uniformly\npositive trend. And certainly, more people having access to these things and\nfeeling like they belong in associated spaces is a good thing. But there are\nalways trade-offs. The ubiquity of, and widespread access to, tech has come\nwith an unprecedented rise in surveillance through our devices, a loss of\ncontrol over our personal data, and a sense of alienation fostered by tech\ncompanies who want to own as much of our attention as possible.\n\nFor people like me, who grew up during the 1990s and 2000s, it can sometimes\nfeel like the exciting period of the internet and computing is over. Pictures\nof LAN parties represent that early era of the internet, when it was a place\nthat you visited rather than a parallel layer of reality. As we\u2019ve watched\nthat mysterious, alluring, and perilous internet get progressively fenced off,\npaywalled, and centralized by a few massive corporations, some of us are\nbeginning to reflect on our relationship to it.\n\nPerhaps this thing that was so important to us in our youth, that we\u2019ve\nstubbornly stuck with despite sweeping structural changes, is no longer so\nrelevant to our lives. Maybe it\u2019s time to start figuring out new ways to use\nthe internet and computers to enrich our world. And maybe LAN parties can\noffer one model for that.\n\nExcerpted from LAN PARTY: Inside the Multiplayer Revolution, by merritt k\n\nText \u00a9 2023 merritt k\n\n\u00a9 2024 Thames & Hudson Ltd, London\n\nReprinted by permission of Thames & Hudson Inc, www.thamesandhudsonusa.com\n\nPg 118: \u00a9 Robert McNeil Brisbane (Australia), 2006\n\nAlready a user?Log in\n\n## Thanks for reading Aftermath!\n\n### Please register to read more free articles\n\nSee all subscription options\n\nEnjoyed this article?
