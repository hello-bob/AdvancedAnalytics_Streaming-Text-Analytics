In an ideal world, I claim, the way you would\nmake decisions about how to spend your time would be something along the lines\nof: \u2013 Think about what you like / dislike \u2013 Think about the most efficient\nways to get the things you like while minimizing the things you dislike \u2013 At\nthe same time, consider how tractable it is to modify your likes and dislikes\n\nFor example, some people really like attention and prestige; other people\ndon\u2019t care for those things and prefer pleasure, or autonomy, or discovery.\nSome people really dislike pain, or tedium. Other people don\u2019t mind those\nthings as much, but especially dislike risk, or being disrespected, or\ncompromising their principles. We all have different bundles of likes and\ndislikes, so the ideal lives we choose for ourselves will be different.\n\nAnd some people find it more aversive to work hard than other people do. In\ntheory, that should just be one of the terms in your decision calculus \u2014 Could\nyou get a lot more of the things you want, if you self-modified to be more\ntolerant of work? How tractable it is for you to self-modify in that way?\n\nBut if we only have a morally judgmental word like \u201clazy\u201d to refer to a\ndislike of work, then that screws up your decision process. It becomes hard to\nthink objectively about the questions in the previous paragraph.\n\nInstead, you feel pressure to choose a life that involves a lot of work,\nbecause that \u201cshould\u201d be fine with you, even if it isn\u2019t. Or you feel pressure\nto self-modify to become more tolerant of work \u2014 even if that\u2019s not very\ntractable for you, or even it\u2019s actually possible to get the things you want\nwithout working hard. Or you still end up choosing the optimal life for you,\nbut you feel unnecessarily guilty about the fact that you chose to optimize\nfor avoiding work.\n\nWhen I advocate for finding a non-judgmental term for \u201clazy\u201d, I\u2019m not saying\nthat people shouldn\u2019t work hard, or that they shouldn\u2019t learn to be tolerant\nof work. I\u2019m saying that whether you should do those things depends on your\nutility function, your specific bundle of likes and dislikes. And I\u2019m saying\nthat it\u2019s easier to think about those questions if you strip them of their\nnormative undertones.\n\n(NOTE: This new word for \u201clazy\u201d doesn\u2019t need to become widely used in our\nculture. I agree that\u2019s a hard problem, and subject to connotation creep, as\nmany people have pointed out. I was more imagining some individuals choosing\nto use the new word when thinking about their own lives, or discussing their\nchoices with close friends / partners. Simply deciding to strip the normative\nconnotations from \u201clazy\u201d could also work.)\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nPosted on August 16, 2018 by Julia Galef.
