Kim explains it.\n\nThen Jordan Peterson gets into the mix. \u201cWhen x is zero, x squared is also\nzero,\u201d he says, doing the same for a table of values. It all seems like a\nfever dream, but attentive viewers might be on their way to graphing functions\nin the time of a TikTok.\n\nThe real Kim Kardashian and Jordan Peterson aren\u2019t in the business of\npublishing short-form educational math videos on social media. That\u2019s Kabir\nKnupp\u2019s job. As a 23-year-old London-based data engineer with experience in\ntutoring, Kab runs the channel Onlock Learning, where he uses Parrot AI to\ngenerate deepfake videos of celebrities explaining basic concepts in math,\nphysics, and engineering.\n\nWith sleek editing, simple language, and a relatable vibe, Kab\u2019s videos have\nracked up millions of views and a shout-out from Elon Musk, whose likeness Kab\nreplicated in a video where the tech mogul explains logarithms.\n\nKab had the idea for Onlock Learning while scrolling through \u201cbrain rot\u201d\ncontent on YouTube Shorts. He wondered: \u201cIf we\u2019re watching brain rot [...] and\nreally random stuff that maybe doesn\u2019t give you any knowledge value, is there\na way to kind of merge it so that you actually do get [...] valuable content?\u201d\n\nSo he landed on a simple plan: Take the attention-grabbing strategies that\nmake brain-rot content virtually irresistible and use them to package\neducational content. For example, his videos use quick cuts, background music,\nsubtitles (which give your eyes something to lock on to, Kab noted), and, of\ncourse, AI-generated celebrities.\n\n\u201cThose things just really get you fixated on [the content] and make it super\neasy to watch,\u201d Kab told Freethink.\n\nHe initially planned to make AI-generated celebrities a small part of his\nstrategy. After all, one friend had told him that having conversations with AI\nEminem, Donald Trump, or Ariana Grande might be a bit tacky. But then one of\nhis deepfake videos \u2014 featuring him speaking with Santa Claus and Buddy the\nElf on Christmas Eve \u2014 went viral. \u201cIt was good validation for my whole idea,\u201d\nKab said.\n\nKab\u2019s not quite sure why AI celebrity tutors are so popular. Maybe it\u2019s that\nthere\u2019s something immediately captivating about celebrities playing against\ntype: It\u2019s surprising and funny to see someone like Ariana Grande or Donald\nTrump explaining a logarithm or an indefinite integral, similar to how it\u2019s\nfunny and disarming to see Will Ferrell \u2014 a grown man with an NFL player\u2019s\nbuild \u2014 wear yellow tights as Buddy the Elf.\n\nBut are viewers really learning from the videos, or is this mostly just a fun\ngimmick? After all, attention-grabbing strategies like quick edits and\nfamiliar faces might be good for hooking viewers, but these devices might also\nbe distracting. Kab seemed to agree. \u201c[My strategy is] definitely not as\neffective as if someone did find the concentration span\u201d to learn in more\nconventional ways, with textbook, pen, and paper.\n\nStill, some viewers said they\u2019re learning from the videos.\n\n\u201cBro\u2019s explanation is better than my teacher,\u201d wrote one commenter.\n\u201cUnderstanding it after i failed maths,\u201d wrote another. One suggested: \u201cThis\nmay be the best use of generative AI that presently exists.\u201d\n\nWithout empirical data, it\u2019s difficult to know how effective this type of\nstrategy is in helping viewers grasp and retain educational content. But Kab\nsuggested the main function of his videos is to get people interested in\nexploring deeper concepts in math, physics, and engineering.\n\n> \u201cIt\u2019s a good start because it brings people to it and keeps them on there,\u201d\n> he said. \u201cIf your brain\u2019s already rotted from social media and you can\u2019t get\n> off it, in my opinion, it\u2019s a good segue to get back into [learning].\u201d\n\nKab plans to expand his online education offerings into a gamified project,\none that keeps the general vibe of his short-form videos but ditches the AI\ncelebrities. He predicts AI will soon enable all sorts of new ways to learn,\nsuch as video-game worlds populated with computer-generated characters with\nwhom you can have real-time conversations about complex topics.\n\nHow effective such teaching techniques will be remains an open question. But\nKab\u2019s approach to online teaching raises a valid question about the future of\neducation: \u201cIt\u2019s young people learning this stuff, mainly, so why is none of\nthe content, or the way it\u2019s delivered, designed or tailored to young people?\u201d\n\nRelated\n\nMemory\n\nHow sensory gamma rhythm stimulation clears amyloid in Alzheimer\u2019s mice\n\nStudy finds stimulating a brain rhythm with light and sound increases peptide\nrelease from interneurons, possibly slowing Alzheimer\u2019s progression.\n\nDavid Orenstein | The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory | MIT News\n\nRobotics\n\nMeet the humanoids: 8 robots ready to revolutionize work\n\nEverything you need to know about the humanoids that will soon enter the\nworkforce \u2014 or are in it already.\n\nKristin Houser\n\nFood\n\nThis startup is trying to solve lab-grown meat\u2019s biggest problem\n\nA biotech startup has developed a new kind of bioreactor that could help\nincrease cultivated meat production.\n\nKristin Houser\n\nAI\n\nHow to build the skills needed for the age of AI\n\nKnowledge-based workers already need to skill-up to coexist with sophisticated\nartificial intelligence technologies.\n\nJuliana Guaqueta Ospina | Education Specialist | International Finance Corporation | World Economic Forum\n\nAerospace\n\nT-Minus: $11B Mars rocks, Voyager 1\u2019s resurrection, and more\n\nFreethink\u2019s weekly countdown of the biggest space news, featuring NASA\u2019s Mars\nrock request, the Dragonfly mission, and more.\n\nKristin Houser\n\nUp Next\n\nHow much of our recycling actually gets recycled?
