When people reuse usernames and passwords across services or make\nsmall, easily intuited changes between them, actors can gain access to\naccounts with even more identifying information and access.\n\nIn the case of the Roku attacks, that meant access to stored payment methods,\nwhich could then be used to buy streaming subscriptions and Roku hardware.\nRoku wrote on its blog, and in a mandated data breach report, that purchases\noccurred in \"less than 400 cases\" and that full credit card numbers and other\n\"sensitive information\" was not revealed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first incident, \"earlier this year,\" involved roughly 15,000 user\naccounts, Roku stated. By monitoring these accounts, Roku identified a second\nincident, one that touched 576,000 accounts. These were collectively \"a small\nfraction of Roku's more than 80M active accounts,\" the post states, but the\nstreaming giant will work to prevent future such stuffing attacks.\n\nThe affected accounts will have their passwords reset and will be notified,\nalong with having charges reversed. Every Roku account, when next requiring a\nlogin, will now need to verify their account through a link sent to their\nemail address. Alternatively, one can use the device ID of any linked Roku\ndevice, according to Roku's support page. (Forcing this upgrade yourself is\nprobably a good idea for past or present Roku owners.)\n\n### Further Reading\n\n\u201cDisgraceful\u201d: Messy ToS update allegedly locks Roku devices until users give\nin\n\nSecurity blog BleepingComputer reported around the time of the incident that\nbreached Roku accounts were sold for as little as 50 cents each and likely\nobtained using commonly available stuffing tools that bypass brute-force\nprotections through proxies and other means. BleepingComputer reported that \"a\nsource\" tied Roku's recent updates to its Dispute Resolution Terms, which all\nbut locked Roku devices until a customer agreed, to the fraudulent activity.\nRoku told BleepingComputer that the two were not related.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Gameplay Was Perfected Months Before Release\n\n#### reader comments\n\n55\n\nKevin Purdy Kevin is a senior technology reporter at Ars Technica, covering a\nvariety of technology topics and reviewing products.
