A chef was flown in from California to preside\nover a vegetarian menu. President Biden extolled the shared values of a\nrelationship \u201cbuilt on mutual trust, candor and respect.\u201d\n\nBut even as the Indian leader was basking in U.S. adulation on June 22, an\nofficer in India\u2019s intelligence service was relaying final instructions to a\nhired hit team to kill one of Modi\u2019s most vocal critics in the United States.\n\nThe assassination is a \u201cpriority now,\u201d wrote Vikram Yadav, an officer in\nIndia\u2019s spy agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, or RAW, according to\ncurrent and former U.S. and Indian security officials.\n\nSkip to end of carousel\n\n###### Repression\u2019s long arm\n\nIndia\u2019s assassination plots in the United States and Canada are part of an\nexpanding wave of aggression against dissident groups seeking protection in\nother countries. Their home governments are increasingly willing to disregard\nthe sovereignty of those nations and send agents across borders to subdue\npolitical enemies.\n\nThe Washington Post is investigating a global surge in these campaigns of\ncross-border repression, as well as the global forces leading India and other\nnations to employ tactics normally associated with the world\u2019s most repressive\ngovernments. For this story, Post reporters conducted dozens of interviews\nwith officials, experts and targeted individuals in New Delhi, Washington,\nOttawa, London, Prague and Berlin.\n\nAmid shifting geopolitical forces, the United States and other Western\ngovernments have struggled to stem this tide of repression. India has faced\nfew consequences for its use of violence and intimidation against dissident\ngroups, in part because the United States and its allies want closer ties with\nIndia in a new era of competition with China.\n\nCross-border repression takes various forms including violence, harassment and\nsurveillance. India, which eclipsed China last year as the world\u2019s most-\npopulous country, is part of an expanding roster of dozens of nations now\nemploying such tactics. As a result, sanctuary for dissident groups is\nshrinking on nearly every continent.\n\n1/2\n\nEnd of carousel\n\nYadav forwarded details about the target, Sikh activist Gurpatwant Singh\nPannun, including his New York address, according to the officials and a U.S.\nindictment. As soon as the would-be assassins could confirm that Pannun, a\nU.S. citizen, was home, \u201cit will be a go ahead from us.\u201d\n\nYadav\u2019s identity and affiliation, which have not previously been reported,\nprovide the most explicit evidence to date that the assassination plan \u2014\nultimately thwarted by U.S. authorities \u2014 was directed from within the Indian\nspy service. Higher-ranking RAW officials have also been implicated, according\nto current and former Western security officials, as part of a sprawling\ninvestigation by the CIA, FBI and other agencies that has mapped potential\nlinks to Modi\u2019s inner circle.\n\nIn reports that have been closely held within the American government, U.S.\nintelligence agencies have assessed that the operation targeting Pannun was\napproved by the RAW chief at the time, Samant Goel. That finding is consistent\nwith accounts provided to The Washington Post by former senior Indian security\nofficials who had knowledge of the operation and said Goel was under extreme\npressure to eliminate the alleged threat of Sikh extremists overseas. U.S. spy\nagencies have more tentatively assessed that Modi\u2019s national security adviser,\nAjit Doval, was probably aware of RAW\u2019s plans to kill Sikh activists, but\nofficials emphasized that no smoking gun proof has emerged.\n\nNeither Doval nor Goel responded to calls and text messages seeking comment.\n\nThis examination of Indian assassination plots in North America, and RAW\u2019s\nincreasingly aggressive global posture, is based on interviews with more than\nthree dozen current and former senior officials in the United States, India,\nCanada, Britain, Germany and Australia. Citing security concerns and the\nsensitivity of the subject, most spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThat India would pursue lethal operations in North America has stunned Western\nsecurity officials. In some ways, however, it reflects a profound shift in\ngeopolitics. After years of being treated as a second-tier player, India sees\nitself as a rising force in a new era of global competition, one that even the\nUnited States cannot afford to alienate.\n\nFollow Election 2024\n\nAsked why India would risk attempting an assassination on U.S. soil, a Western\nsecurity official said: \u201cBecause they knew they could get away with it.\u201d\n\nThe foiled assassination was part of an escalating campaign of aggression by\nRAW against the Indian diaspora in Asia, Europe and North America, officials\nsaid. The plot in the United States coincided with the June 18 shooting death\nof Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey, B.C., near Vancouver \u2014 an\noperation also linked to Yadav, according to Western officials. Both plots\ntook place amid a wave of violence in Pakistan, where at least 11 Sikh or\nKashmiri separatists living in exile and labeled terrorists by the Modi\ngovernment have been killed over the past two years.\n\nThe Indian intelligence service has ramped up its surveillance and harassment\nof Sikhs and other groups overseas perceived as disloyal to the Modi\ngovernment, officials said. RAW officers and agents have faced arrest,\nexpulsion and reprimand in countries including Australia, Germany and Britain,\naccording to officials who provided details to The Post that have not\npreviously been made public.\n\nThe revelations have added to Western concerns about Modi, whose tenure has\nbeen marked by economic growth and rising global stature for India, but also\ndeepening authoritarianism. A recent report by Freedom House, a human rights\norganization, listed India among the world\u2019s practitioners of \u201ctransnational\nrepression,\u201d a term for governments\u2019 use of intimidation or violence against\ntheir own citizens \u2014 dissidents, activists, journalists \u2014 in others\u2019 sovereign\nterritory.\n\nIndia is part of an expanding roster of countries employing tactics previously\nassociated with China, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and other repressive\nregimes. It is a trend fueled by factors ranging from surging strains of\nnationalism and authoritarianism to the spread of social media and spyware\nthat both empower and endanger dissident groups.\n\nIndia\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs declined to respond to detailed questions\nsubmitted by The Post or provide comment for this article. Responding to\nquestions raised by a Post reporter at a news briefing last week, spokesman\nRandhir Jaiswal said that India was still investigating the allegations and\nthat the Pannun case \u201cequally impacts our national security.\u201d\n\nJaiswal referred reporters to previous ministry statements that targeted\nkillings are \u201cnot our policy.\u201d\n\nFor the Biden administration, which has spent three years cultivating closer\nties with India, the assassination plots have pitted professed values against\nstrategic interests.\n\nLast July, White House officials began holding high-level meetings to discuss\nways to respond without risking a wider rupture with India, officials said.\nCIA Director William J. Burns and others have been deployed to confront\nofficials in the Modi government and demand accountability. But the United\nStates has so far imposed no expulsions, sanctions or other penalties.\n\nEven the U.S. criminal case reflects this restraint. Senior officials at the\nJustice Department and FBI had pushed to prosecute Yadav, officials said, a\nstep that would have implicated RAW in a murder-for-hire conspiracy. But while\na U.S. indictment unsealed in November contained the bombshell allegation that\nthe plot was directed by an Indian official, it referred to Yadav as only an\nunnamed co-conspirator, \u201cCC-1,\u201d and made no mention of the Indian spy agency.\n\nJustice Department officials who took part in the White House deliberations\nsided against those urging criminal charges against Yadav. Administration\nofficials denied any undue influence. \u201cCharging decisions are the prerogative\nof law enforcement alone,\u201d said National Security Council spokesperson\nAdrienne Watson, \u201cand the Biden NSC has rigorously respected that\nindependence.\u201d\n\nThe only U.S. charges made public to date are against an alleged middleman,\nNikhil Gupta, who is described in the indictment as an Indian drug and weapons\ntrafficker enlisted to hire a contract killer. Gupta, an Indian national who\nhas denied the charges, was arrested in Prague on June 30 and remains in\nprison. He is awaiting a Czech court ruling on a U.S. request for his\nextradition.\n\nEven in recent days, the Biden administration has taken steps to contain the\nfallout from the assassination plot. White House officials warned the Modi\ngovernment this month that The Post was close to publishing an investigation\nthat would reveal new details about the case. It did so without notifying The\nPost.\n\n###\n\nLaying a trap\n\nFor decades, RAW was regarded as a regional player, preoccupied by proxy wars\nwith Pakistan\u2019s Inter-Services Intelligence spy agency. Under Modi, however,\nRAW has been wielded as a weapon against dissidents in India\u2019s vast global\ndiaspora, according to current and former U.S. and Indian officials.\n\nThe U.S. operation shows how RAW tried to export tactics it has used for years\nin countries neighboring India, officials said, including the use of criminal\nsyndicates for operations it doesn\u2019t want traced to New Delhi. It also exposed\nwhat former Indian security officials described as disturbing lapses in\njudgment and tradecraft.\n\nAfter the plot against Pannun failed, the decision to entrust Yadav with the\nhigh-risk mission sparked recriminations within the agency, former officials\nsaid. Rather than joining RAW as a junior officer, Yadav had been brought in\nmidcareer from India\u2019s less prestigious Central Reserve Police Force, said one\nformer official. As a result, the official said, Yadav lacked training and\nskills needed for an operation that meant going up against sophisticated U.S.\ncounterintelligence capabilities.\n\nAttempts by The Post to locate or contact Yadav were unsuccessful. A former\nIndian security official said he was transferred back to the Central Reserve\nPolice Force after the Pannun plot unraveled.\n\nThe U.S. affidavit describes Yadav as an \u201cassociate\u201d of Gupta who procured the\nalleged drug trafficker\u2019s help by arranging for the dismissal of criminal\ncharges he faced in India. Gupta had a history of collaborating with India\u2019s\nsecurity services on operations in Afghanistan and other countries, according\nto a person with knowledge of his background, but he had never been used for\njobs in the West.\n\nPetr Slepicka, a lawyer in Prague who represents Gupta, declined to comment on\nthe case except to say that his client denies the charges against him. In\ncourt filings in India, Gupta\u2019s family members described him as an innocent\n\u201cmiddle-class businessman\u201d whose arrest was a case of mistaken identity. They\nsaid he traveled to Prague \u201cfor tourism\u201d and to explore new markets for a\n\u201chandicraft\u201d business, according to the court filings.\n\nYadav and Gupta spent weeks trading encrypted texts about the plot to kill\nPannun, according to a U.S. affidavit filed in support of the request for\nGupta\u2019s extradition. To find a willing assassin, Gupta reached out to someone\nhe had been in touch with for at least eight years and understood to be a drug\nand weapons dealer. In reality, according to the affidavit, the supposed\ndealer was an informant for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nThe two were discussing \u201canother potential firearms and narcotics\ntransaction,\u201d according to the affidavit when, on May 30, Gupta abruptly asked\n\u201cabout the possibility of hiring someone to murder a lawyer living in New\nYork.\u201d\n\nFrom that moment, U.S. agents had an inside but incomplete view of the\nunfolding conspiracy. They orchestrated Gupta\u2019s introduction to a supposed\nassassin who was actually an undercover agent, according to court filings.\nThey captured images of cash changing hands in a car in New York City \u2014 a\n$15,000 down payment on a job that was to cost $100,000 when completed.\n\nAt one point, the indictment said, U.S. agents even got footage of Gupta\nturning his camera toward three men \u201cdressed in business attire, sitting\naround a conference room,\u201d an apparent reference to Indian operatives\noverseeing the mission. \u201cWe are all counting on you,\u201d Gupta told the purported\nassassin on the video call, according to the indictment.\n\nYadav indicated that there would be more jobs after Pannun, including one \u201cbig\ntarget\u201d in Canada. But a separate hit team got to that assignment first,\naccording to the U.S. indictment, suggesting that RAW was working with\nmultiple criminal elements.\n\nHours after Nijjar was gunned down in his car on June 18 outside the Guru\nNanak Sikh Gurdwara temple in Surrey, Yadav sent a video clip to Gupta\n\u201cshowing Nijjar\u2019s bloody body slumped in his vehicle,\u201d according to the\nindictment.\n\nThe message arrived as U.S. authorities were laying a trap for Gupta. Seeking\nto draw him out of India and into a friendly jurisdiction, U.S. agents used\ntheir DEA informant to persuade Gupta to travel to the Czech Republic for what\nhe was led to believe would be a clandestine meeting with his American\ncontact, according to officials familiar with the operation.\n\nGupta arrived in Prague on June 30 \u2014 11 days after Czech authorities, acting\nat the behest of U.S. officials, had secretly issued an arrest warrant for\nhim.\n\nAs he exited Vaclav Havel Airport, Gupta was intercepted by Czech police, who\nushered him into a vehicle in which two U.S. federal agents were waiting,\naccording to court filings submitted by Gupta\u2019s family in India. He was\nquestioned for hours while the car meandered around the city. His laptop was\nseized and his phone held to his face to unlock it, according to the family\npetition.\n\nGupta was eventually deposited in Prague\u2019s Pankrac Prison, where he remains\nawaiting possible extradition. Seeking help, Gupta\u2019s family tried to reach\nYadav last year but could find no trace of him, according to a person familiar\nwith the matter. After months of near-constant contact with Gupta, the person\nsaid, CC-1 had \u201cdisappeared.\u201d\n\n###\n\nEngaging with the underworld\n\nThough Yadav served as RAW\u2019s point man, current and former officials said the\noperation involved higher-ranking officials with ties to Modi\u2019s inner circle.\nAmong those suspected of involvement or awareness are Goel and Doval, though\nU.S. officials said there is no direct evidence so far of their complicity.\n\nAs RAW chief at the time, Goel was \u201cunder pressure\u201d to neutralize the alleged\nthreat posed by Sikh extremists overseas, said a former Indian security\nofficial. Goel reported to Doval, and had ties to the hard-line national\nsecurity adviser going back decades.\n\nBoth had built their reputations in the 1980s, when the country\u2019s security\nservices battled Sikh separatists and Muslim militants. They were part of a\ngeneration of security professionals shaped by those conflicts much the way\ntheir U.S. counterparts came to be defined by the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nDoval, 79, has claimed roles in undercover missions from the jungles of\nMyanmar to the back alleys of Lahore, Pakistan \u2014 tales that contributed to his\nfrequent depiction in the press as the \u201cJames Bond of India.\u201d\n\nHe also exhibited a willingness to engage with the criminal underworld. In\n2005, after retiring as head of India\u2019s domestic intelligence service, he was\ninadvertently detained by Mumbai police while meeting with a reputed gangster.\nDoval was seeking to enlist one crime boss to assassinate another, according\nto media reports later confirmed by senior Indian officials.\n\nBefore being tapped as national security adviser by Modi in 2014, Doval\npublicly called for India\u2019s security apparatus to shift from \u201cdefense\u201d to\n\u201cdefensive offense\u201d against groups threatening India from other countries,\nespecially Pakistan.\n\nGoel, who was then rising into the senior ranks at RAW, shared Doval\u2019s\ninstincts. Police forces under Goel\u2019s command in the early 1990s were tied to\nmore than 120 cases of alleged extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances\nor torture, according to a database maintained by Ensaaf, an Indian human\nrights group based in the United States. Goel was so closely associated with\nthe brutal crackdown that he became an assassination target, according to\nassociates who said he took to traveling in a bulletproof vehicle.\n\nFormer Indian officials who know both men said Goel would not have proceeded\nwith assassination plots in North America without the approval of his superior\nand protector.\n\n\u201cWe always had to go to the NSA for clearance for any operations,\u201d said A.S.\nDulat, who served as RAW chief in the early 2000s, referring to the national\nsecurity adviser. Dulat emphasized in an interview with The Post that he did\nnot have inside knowledge of the alleged operations, and that assassinations\nwere not part of RAW\u2019s repertoire during his tenure.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have reached a similar conclusion. Given Doval\u2019s\nreputation and the hierarchical nature of the Indian system, CIA analysts have\nassessed that Doval probably knew of or approved RAW\u2019s plans to kill Sikhs his\ngovernment considered terrorists, U.S. officials said.\n\n###\n\nA fierce crackdown\n\nIndia\u2019s shift to \u201cdefensive offense\u201d was followed by a series of clashes\nbetween RAW and Western domestic security services.\n\nIn Australia, two RAW officers were expelled in 2020 after authorities broke\nup what Mike Burgess, head of the Australian intelligence service, described\nas a \u201cnest of spies.\u201d\n\nForeign officers were caught monitoring \u201ctheir country\u2019s diaspora community,\u201d\ntrying to penetrate local police departments and stealing information about\nsensitive security systems at Australian airports, Burgess said in a 2021\nspeech. He didn\u2019t name the service, but Australian officials confirmed to The\nPost that it was RAW.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn Germany, federal police have made arrests in recent years to root out\nagents RAW had recruited within Sikh communities. Among them, German officials\nsaid, were a husband and wife who operated a website purportedly covering\nlocal Sikh events but who were secretly on RAW\u2019s payroll.\n\nIn Britain, RAW\u2019s surveillance and harassment of the Sikh population \u2014\nespecially a large concentration near Birmingham \u2014 became so egregious in 2014\nand 2015 that MI5, Britain\u2019s domestic security service, delivered warnings to\nGoel, who was then serving as RAW\u2019s station chief in London.\n\nWhen confronted, Goel scoffed at his counterparts and accused them of coddling\nSikh activists he said should be considered terrorists, according to current\nand former British officials. After further run-ins, British authorities\nthreatened to expel him, officials said. Instead, Goel returned to New Delhi\nand continued to climb RAW\u2019s ranks until, in 2019, he was given the agency\u2019s\ntop job.\n\nRAW\u2019s record of aggressive activity in Britain has fanned suspicion that the\nagency was involved in the death of Sikh activist Avtar Singh Khanda, who died\nin Birmingham last year, three days before Nijjar was killed in Canada.\nBritish officials have said Khanda suffered from leukemia and died of natural\ncauses, though his family and supporters have continued to press for further\ninvestigation.\n\nA U.S. State Department human rights report released this month catalogued\nIndia\u2019s alleged engagement in transnational repression. It cited credible\naccounts of \u201cextraterritorial killing, kidnapping, forced returns or other\nviolence,\u201d as well as \u201cthreats, harassment, arbitrary surveillance and\ncoercion\u201d of overseas dissidents and journalists.\n\nRAW\u2019s operations in Western countries during Modi\u2019s tenure have been\noverwhelmingly aimed at followers of the Sikh religion, especially a minority\nfaction seeking to revive the largely dormant cause of creating a separate\nstate called \u201cKhalistan.\u201d\n\nThat movement had peaked in the 1980s, when thousands were killed in violent\nskirmishes between the Indian government and Sikh insurgents. One brutal\nsequence beginning in 1984 included an Indian assault on the Sikh religion\u2019s\nholiest site, the Golden Temple; the assassination of Prime Minister Indira\nGandhi by Sikhs in her security detail; and the bombing of an Air India flight\nwidely attributed to Sikh extremists. A fierce crackdown quashed the\ninsurgency, prompting an exodus of Sikhs to diaspora communities in Canada,\nthe United States and Britain.\n\nAs Sikhs settled into their new lives abroad, the Khalistani cause went quiet\nuntil a new generation of activists \u2014 whose leaders included Pannun and Nijjar\n\u2014 sought to rekindle the movement with unofficial referendums on Sikh\nstatehood and with protests that at times have seemed to glorify violence. A\nparade in Canada last year included a float depicting Indira Gandhi\u2019s\nassassination, and Khalistan supporters have stormed and defaced Indian\ndiplomatic facilities in Western cities.\n\nThe effort has seemed to gain little traction beyond a minority within the\ndiaspora community. Even so, it has been portrayed as a resurgent menace by\nModi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. Indian officials have\naccused Canada and the United States of harboring Sikh separatists who they\nsay have plotted attacks and smuggled weapons into India.\n\nAjai Sahni, executive director of the Institute for Conflict Management in New\nDelhi and an expert on the insurgency in Punjab, said BJP depictions of the\nSikh threat are \u201cfar in excess of what actually exists.\u201d Officials have\npolitical incentive to exaggerate, he said, \u201cbecause it is useful to polarize\nand to keep a threat alive so the state can present itself as a guarantor of\nsecurity to 80 percent of the country \u2014 the Hindus \u2014 who are supposedly in\ndanger.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, Pannun and Nijjar had come to personify that alleged danger.\nIn 2020, both men were declared terrorists by Modi\u2019s government under an\namended law that was denounced by U.N. officials and human rights groups for\ndepriving suspects of due process. Their organization, Sikhs for Justice, was\naccused of leading \u201ca concerted secessionist campaign.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with The Post, Pannun denied engaging in terrorism and said he\nwas targeted because of his activism on behalf of Sikhs. \u201cThey wanted to\nassassinate me so they can stop the ongoing Khalistan referendum movement for\nthe secession of Punjab from Indian occupation,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his few public remarks on the plots to kill Pannun and Nijjar, Modi has\nbeen dismissive. \u201cIf a citizen of ours has done anything good or bad, we are\nready to look into it,\u201d he said in an interview with the Financial Times\npublished in late December. \u201cOur commitment is to the rule of law.\u201d\n\nU.S. and Western security officials said it is unlikely that RAW would have\nlaunched such operations without a clear understanding that doing so would be\nmet with approval by the prime minister.\n\nSince coming to power in 2014, Modi has cultivated the aura of a Hindu\nstrongman. He has jailed dissidents, released photos of himself riding in\ntanks and flying fighter jets, and boasted of ordering an airstrike in 2019\nagainst nuclear-armed Pakistan.\n\nPro-Modi media outlets have burnished this bellicose image. Last year, as 11\nalleged militants were killed in a wave of unclaimed attacks in Pakistan,\nfavored Indian TV stations celebrated the \u201cprofessional\u201d killing of\nKhalistanis outside India\u2019s borders. Among those killed was Paramjit Singh\nPanjwar, 63, a leader of a militant group called the Khalistan Commando Force,\nwho was shot dead last May near a park in Lahore by two gunmen who fled on\nmotorcycle, according to media reports.\n\n###\n\nResolving the matter internally\n\nEven as the alleged RAW assassination plots reached their final stages,\nofficials in both the United States and Canada remained unaware of the full\ndimensions of the conspiracy.\n\nIn Canada, Nijjar\u2019s death was at first assumed to be a case of score-settling\nbetween rival Sikh and criminal factions in British Colombia. In the United\nStates, the Pannun plot was for weeks treated as a DEA case.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until Gupta\u2019s arrest that U.S. officials obtained evidence that an\nofficer in India\u2019s spy service was behind the conspiracy, officials said.\nDevices seized from Gupta provided a trove of new intelligence, including his\nextensive communications with Yadav, officials said.\n\nShortly afterward, in July, the White House convened a series of \u201cdeputies\ncommittee\u201d meetings led by deputy national security adviser Jon Finer and\ninvolving Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco and Deputy CIA Director David\nCohen.\n\nThose assembled confronted evidence of a grave violation of U.S. sovereignty\nby a nation seen as increasingly indispensable in the global competition with\nChina. After weeks of deliberations, administration officials settled on a\nplan they hoped would ward off future plots without causing deeper ruptures\nwith India.\n\nIn early August, the administration dispatched CIA Director Burns to New Delhi\nto confront his counterparts with intelligence on the Pannun plot and give\nModi\u2019s government a chance to resolve the matter internally. The United States\nwould refrain from punitive responses but pushed India to hold those\nresponsible accountable. The message was reinforced in subsequent closed-door\nconversations, including a private meeting in New Delhi in September between\nModi and Biden, officials said.\n\nThere would be no expulsions of RAW officers or economic sanctions against\nIndia. A deal to sell up to $4 billion in U.S. armed drones to India, briefly\nput on pause, was allowed to proceed when key congressional leaders signed\noff. Justice Department officials opted for at least the time being not to\nfile charges against Yadav.\n\nThe approach has struck some as too accommodating. Several current and former\nofficials noted that, in contrast to the decision on Yadav, the United States\nhas in recent years filed charges against Russian and Iranian intelligence\nofficers in alleged plots on American soil.\n\nA Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment on the India case,\nsaying it is an \u201congoing matter.\u201d\n\nThe treatment of India does, however, have echoes of how the United States\ndealt with Saudi Arabia after Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was implicated\nin the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and Washington Post\ncontributing columnist who was killed and dismembered in the Saudi Consulate\nin Istanbul.\n\nWhite House officials defend their actions, saying that in private meetings\nModi and his closest advisers have taken the matter seriously and pledged\naccountability. Officials noted that Yadav could still be charged and other\npenalties imposed if New Delhi fails to follow through on these commitments.\n\nCanada, which has the world\u2019s largest Sikh population outside India, took a\nmore forceful approach. In September, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly\naccused India of complicity in the killing of Nijjar and expelled RAW\u2019s\nstation chief in Ottawa.\n\nRelations between the countries went into a tailspin. Canada withdrew 41\ndiplomats from India after Modi\u2019s government threatened to revoke their\nlegally protected status. Canadian officials who traveled to New Delhi for\nmeetings with Doval and others said they were greeted with denials of Indian\ninvolvement and lectures on alleged Sikh terrorism.\n\nCanadian intelligence agencies saw a surge in communications from Indian\nofficials in Delhi to Indian diplomats in Ottawa conspicuously professing\nignorance about who was responsible for Nijjar\u2019s killing \u2014 exchanges that\nCanadian officials came to regard as disinformation intended to be intercepted\nand confuse investigators, officials said.\n\nThe standoff eased over the ensuing months, officials said, as Modi officials\nfacing U.S.-provided evidence came to realize that their denials were\nuntenable.\n\n###\n\n\u2018The New India\u2019\n\nThere are indications that India planned a broader wave of killings in the\nUnited States and Canada.\n\nYadav had told Gupta there were \u201cthree or four\u201d other people RAW wanted dead\nonce Nijjar and Pannun had been assassinated, according to the affidavit.\nGupta, in turn, told a U.S. agent posing as a hit man that there are \u201cso many\ntargets.\u201d\n\nIn the past two years, at least five Sikh activists in the United States and\nfive in Canada were warned by law enforcement to take precautions. Among them\nwas Pritpal Singh in Fremont, Calif., who said he was visited by FBI agents\ndays after Nijjar was killed.\n\nIndia continues to treat the matter with a mixture of indignation and\nresignation.\n\nThe government appointed a special panel to investigate the attacks and report\nits findings to the United States. A U.S. delegation that traveled to New\nDelhi several weeks ago for an update on the probe, however, returned with\nlittle evidence of meaningful progress.
