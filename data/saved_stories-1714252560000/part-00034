But it\u2019s also a map of Vadi\u2019s personal California.\n\nFrom Pomona, where he was raised, to the Bay Area, where he lived until\nrecently, \u201cChipped\u201d charts the state\u2019s urban spaces as seen from the back of a\nboard, a network of routes traced block by block by block. Vadi\u2019s vision of\nthe neighborhoods is granular.\n\n\u201cOff I went down Broadway and towards the bike lanes connecting Rockridge with\nneighboring Temescal, from 51st to 40th streets,\u201d he writes of one skate\nsession. \u201cResponding to every crack, car, stop sign, smell, and sound around\nme.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpinion\n\n### Opinion: The most refreshing sport at the Tokyo Olympics: skateboarding\n\nMaking its Olympic debut, skateboarding brought joy and expression to the\nforefront of the Games, showcasing freedom, creativity and individuality.\n\nAug. 10, 2021\n\nThe specific geography may not be familiar to every reader, but the mode\nshould resonate with longtime Californians. Joan Didion once wrote of her own\nnative territory, around Sacramento, that \u201cwhen we talk about sale-leasebacks\nand right-of-way condemnations we are talking in code about the things we like\nbest, the yellow fields and the cottonwoods and the rivers rising and falling\nand the mountain roads closing when the heavy snow comes in.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Vadi conjures California\u2019s charms through descriptions of\ninvitingly empty parking lots, curbs perfectly waxed for skating, perilously\ndesigned intersections and the shimmering temptation of stairways and\nrailings.\n\nFor Vadi, skateboarding isn\u2019t just a sport or a hobby, it\u2019s \u201ca discipline, a\npractice, a ritual.\u201d It\u2019s also a portal, bringing him into contact with the\nungoverned and unfamiliar by allowing him to navigate the world on his terms.\n\nJos\u00e9 Vadi, author of \u201cChipped: Writing From a Skateboarder\u2019s Lens.\u201d\n\n(Bobby Gordon)\n\nThat kind of exploration can be dangerous, especially if you\u2019re not white.\n\n\u201cWhen a Brown kid starts skateboarding in any era they are entering a policed\nworld that presumes their guilt, accelerated now by the four wheels propelling\nthem, sometimes illegally, down city streets, schoolyards, back alleys,\u201d he\nwrites.\n\nBut the adventures that skateboarding facilitates can also be gateways to\nfreedom and self-knowledge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGoing to [live music] shows and skateboarding came around the same time for\nme, finding the spaces on the street and the venues that mattered to me\nbecause I knew each space contained a worldview,\u201d Vadi explains. \u201cCities are\ninvitations to parts of ourselves that we always knew but couldn\u2019t access\nwithout such introductions.\u201d\n\n\u201cChipped\u201d is just as much about the art and culture that surrounds\nskateboarding as it is about the act itself. Vadi reminisces about the music\nhe learned from skate videos as well as the videos themselves, compilations of\nskaters\u2019 best tricks \u2014 and, of course, some of their gnarliest falls. He name-\ndrops iconic shoe and clothing brands \u2014 Emerica, Dickies, Airwalk \u2014 as well as\nthe skate magazines, like Thrasher and Transworld Skateboarding, where he\nfound out what the best skaters were wearing.\n\nOpinion\n\n### Op-Ed: Skateboarding, not surfing, should be California\u2019s official state\nsport\n\nIn case you missed the headlines, Assemblyman Al Muratsuchi of Torrance has\nintroduced a bill to make surfing the official sport of California.\n\nMarch 11, 2018\n\nAnother facet of the broader subculture is the \u201cskater\u2019s lens\u201d that the book\u2019s\nsubtitle promises: a sense of radical self-sufficiency, a jaundiced eye toward\nwhat constitutes \u201cpublic space\u201d and what\u2019s allowed in it, a familiarity with\npain and a coolness toward danger.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t enough just to live that lifestyle; Vadi finds that he needs to\nmake something with it too. The book\u2019s final essay, \u201cProgramming Injection,\u201d\nfocuses on a short-lived column of the same name that ran in Transworld\nSkateboarding in the \u201990s. In it, the skater Ed Templeton asserted that\n\u201cdocumentation is domination,\u201d and a young Vadi took it as gospel.\n\nSkateboarding may be an Olympic sport now, but most of its practitioners still\ndo it on the margins, repurposing urban architecture for their own ends. Its\njoys are typically fleeting: A perfectly landed trick becomes iconic only if\nthe moment can be captured, repeated, spread and shared. Skateboarding as Vadi\nunderstands it is an act of defiance, a story that isn\u2019t usually written. Part\nof what makes his documenting it powerful is the proof that a life like this\nis possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cChipped\u201d bears the marks of everything Vadi learned on his board. His prose\nis often vivid and propulsive, describing \u201cbenches so waxed they were black\nslabs of former white concrete, generations of candles melted by the sun and\ngrinded into iconography.\u201d Of course, sometimes his velocity gets away from\nhim, as when he calculates that a skater\u2019s path is \u201ccarved by a body\u2019s\nresponse to space divided by desire of direction multiplied by necessity.\u201d\n\nVadi does his best to make \u201cChipped\u201d accessible to non-skaters, describing the\nbasic mechanics of tricks such as ollies and slappies. But if you\u2019re\nunfamiliar with the sport, it\u2019s best read alongside some of the videos he\ncites \u2014 all of which probably exist on original VHS somewhere but can also be\nfound, in all of their charmingly lo-fi glory, on YouTube. There you can see\nnot only the mechanics of the tricks but also the remarkable integration of\nskaters with their landscapes. Cars pass through shots and threaten to collide\nwith the aftermath of blown tricks; pedestrians gawk and sometimes get in the\nway.\n\nIn skating, Vadi found \u201ca compass, a lens, a portal to joy only found by\ntrying.\u201d \u201cChipped\u201d offers the same even to those of us who have never stepped\nonto a board.\n\nZan Romanoff is a writer and the author of several novels for young adults.\n\n### More to Read\n\n  * ### Graffiti tower debate shows Los Angeles\u2019 contradictory relationship with street culture\n\nMarch 28, 2024\n\n  * ### 10 ways to embrace L.A. as a bus city instead of a car city\n\nMarch 25, 2024\n\n  * ### Column: Is that graffiti or art?
