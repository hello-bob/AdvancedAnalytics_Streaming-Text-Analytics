The address bar at the top, or the Omnibox, and Google\nlikes to call it, is a great way to get started browsing the web \u2014 You can\nenter a URL, Search query, or navigation command for Chrome settings. Now,\nGoogle is adding AI to the mix with Gemini support in the omnibox.\n\nRelated\n\n##### Here's how to prompt Gemini, according to Google\n\nGoogle published a cheat sheet to get the most out of its AI tool\n\nGemini is Google\u2019s flagship AI assistant, and it even replaced Google\nAssistant on Android recently. Access to the AI goodness might seem limited\nfor desktop users, but the company also started forcing AI-generated summaries\natop Search results following initial experimentation. All this while, Gemini\nwas accessible via desktop using a dedicated web page, but the latest Canary\nbuilds for Chrome suggest direct integration with the Chrome omnibox is nearly\ncomplete (via Chrome Story).\n\nAs long as you\u2019re signed in to your account on the Gemini web page, this\nintegration would allow you to precede any query with \u201c@gemini\u201d in the\nomnibox, to receive an answer from the AI. You will be redirected to\ngemini.google.com/prompt and your query should appear in the prompt field,\nfollowed by a response.\n\n## Currently testing in Chrome Canary\n\nHowever, the feature isn\u2019t immediately available to all Chrome users on\ndesktop immediately. You need to enable two flags for the integration to work,\nof which only one is available in the current stable build. The other one, IPH\nmessage for Site search starter pack, is only available on Chrome 125, which\nis currently in Canary testing.\n\nchrome://flags/#omnibox-starter-pack-expansion\n\nchrome://flags/#omnibox-starter-pack-iph\n\nIn principle, the integration is remarkably similar to the search options\nwithin Chrome where you precede a query with @tabs or @bookmarks to search\nwithin those subsections of the browser. We tested the feature in Canary and\nthe UI elements seem polished enough for a stable release. Hopefully, this\nremains one of the key features of Chrome 125 when it goes stable.\nUnfortunately, though, the same flags are unavailable on the mobile version of\nthe browser, so you\u2019re better off querying the AI like you already do.\n\nReaders like you help support Android Police.
