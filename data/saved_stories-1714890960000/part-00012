Kennedy Jr. sued\nDaily Kos to unmask the identity of a community member who posted a critical\nstory about his dalliance with neo-Nazis at a Berlin rally. I updated the\nstory here, here, here, here, and here.\n\nTo briefly summarize, Kennedy wanted us to doxx our community member, and we\nstridently refused. The site and the politician then continued fighting for\nmore than three years. \"Daily Kos lost the first legal round in court,\"\nMoulitsas posted in 2021, \"thanks to a judge who is apparently unconcerned\nwith First Amendment ramifications given the chilling effect of her ruling.\"\n\nBut even then, Moulitsas was clear on his rights: Because of Section 230 of\nthe Communications Decency Act, [Kennedy] cannot sue Daily Kos \u2014 the site\nitself \u2014 for defamation. We are protected by the so-called safe harbor. That's\nwhy he's demanding we reveal what we know about \"DowneastDem\" so they can sue\nher or him directly. Moulitsas also stressed that his own 2021 blog post was\n\"reiterating everything that community member wrote, and expanding on it. And\nso instead of going after a pseudonymous community writer/diarist on this\nsite, maybe Kennedy will drop that pointless lawsuit and go after me...\nconsider this an escalation.\" (Among other things, the post cited a German-\nlanguage news account saying Kennedy \"sounded the alarm concerning the 5G\nmobile network and Microsoft founder Bill Gates...\" Moulitsas also noted an\nIrish Times article which confirmed that at the rally Kennedy spoke at,\n\"Noticeable numbers of neo-Nazis, kitted out with historic Reich flags and\nother extremist accessories, mixed in with the crowd.\")\n\nSo what happened? Moulitsas posted an update Thursday: Shockingly, Kennedy got\na trial court judge in New York to agree with him, and a subpoena was issued\nto Daily Kos to turn over any information we might have on the account.\nHowever, we are based in California, not New York, so once I received the\nsubpoena at home, we had a California court not just quash the subpoena, but\nessentially signal that if New York didn't do the right thing on appeal,\nCalifornia could very well take care of it.\n\nIt's been a while since I updated, and given a favorable court ruling\nThursday, it's way past time to catch everyone up. New York is one of the U.S.\nstates that doesn't have a strict \"Dendrite standard\" law protecting anonymous\nspeech. But soon the blog founder discovered he had allies: The issues at hand\nare so important that The New York Times, the E.W.Scripps Company, the First\nAmendment Coalition, New York Public Radio, and seven other New York media\ncompanies joined the appeals effort with their own joint amicus brief. What\nstarted as a dispute over a Daily Kos diarist has become a meaningful First\nAmendment battle, with major repercussions given New York's role as a major\nnews media and distribution center.\n\nAfter reportedly spending over $1 million on legal fees, Kennedy somehow\ndiscovered the identity of our community member sometime last year and\npromptly filed a defamation suit in New Hampshire in what seemed a clumsy\nattempt at forum shopping, or the practice of choosing where to file suit\nbased on the belief you'll be granted a favorable outcome. The community\nmember lives in Maine, Kennedy lives in California, and Daily Kos doesn't\npublish specifically in New Hampshire. A perplexed court threw out the case\nthis past February on those obvious jurisdictional grounds....\n\nThen, last week, the judge threw out the appeal of that decision because\nKennedy's lawyer didn't file in time \u2014 and blamed the delay on bad Wi-Fi...\n\nKennedy tried to dismiss the original case, the one awaiting an appellate\ndecision in New York, claiming it was now moot. His legal team had sued to get\nthe community member's identity, and now that they had it, they argued that\nthere was no reason for the case to continue. We disagreed, arguing that there\nwere important issues to resolve (i.e., Dendrite), and we also wanted lawyer\nfees for their unconstitutional assault on our First Amendment rights...\n\nOn Thursday, in a unanimous decision, a four-judge New York Supreme Court\nappellate panel ordered the case to continue, keeping the Dendrite issue alive\nand also allowing us to proceed in seeking damages based on New York's anti-\nSLAPP law, which prohibits \"strategic lawsuits against public participation.\"\nThursday's blog post concludes with this summation. \"Kennedy opened up a can\nof worms and has spent millions fighting this stupid battle. Despite his\nlosses, we aren't letting him weasel out of this.\"\n\n### \u2190\n\n### You may like to read:\n\n### \u2192\n\nThe Highest Observatory On Earth Is Now Open\n\n## Frozen Embryos Are 'Children,' According To Alabama's Supreme Court\n\n## Teenagers Have Bought 'Ghost Guns' Online, Sometimes with Deadly\nConsequences\n\n## Iowa School District Is Using AI To Ban Books\n\n## US Supreme Court Rejects US Student Loan Relief.
