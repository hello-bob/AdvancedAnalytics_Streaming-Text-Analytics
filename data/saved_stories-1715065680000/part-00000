Photo courtesy of the\nWard 6 Fire Protection District\n\nLoading your audio article\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the wail of a siren or the buzz of an emergency phone alert that\nwarned Tanya Richard a pipeline near her home was spewing poison gas. The\nfirst hint that something was wrong came from her cats, a motley collection of\nfree-roaming felines that fled her property as the dense cloud of carbon\ndioxide (CO2) rolled over a rural stretch of southwest Louisiana on April 3.\n\n\u201cNormally, I\u2019ve got six kitty cats out here wanting to be fed when I come\nhome,\u201d said Richard, who lives just outside Sulphur, a small Calcasieu Parish\ntown about five miles from Lake Charles. \u201cBut they were nowhere to be found.\nThen I started to notice no cars were passing by. I said, \u2018Tanya, something\nstrange is going on.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs it turned out, a 2-foot diameter pipeline at a CO2 pump station about a\nhalf mile from Richard\u2019s house had ruptured, releasing about 107,000 gallons\nof the gas, which can cause drowsiness, suffocation and sometimes death.\nColorless, odorless, and heavier than air, carbon dioxide can travel\nundetected and at lethal concentrations over large distances.\n\nThe CO2 pipeline network is undergoing rapid expansion as companies invest in\nthe booming carbon capture and sequestration market. With this growth come\nworries that communities may not be prepared or even aware of the potential\nfor dangerous leaks.\n\nIn the outskirts of Sulphur, local police and firefighters could do little\nmore than set up roadblocks and wait for the pipeline\u2019s owner, ExxonMobil\nsubsidiary Denbury Inc., to send repair specialists.\n\nCalcasieu Parish issued a shelter-in-place advisory, urging everyone within a\nquarter mile of the pump station to close doors and windows and turn off air\nconditioners, but officials relied mostly on social media to convey the\nwarning. The parish narrowed its emergency alert system to phone numbers\nlisted for addresses within a quarter mile of the station. That amounted to\nabout eight homes \u2013 four of which were likely unoccupied, according to parish\nofficials.\n\nThe pump station and pipeline aren\u2019t equipped with alarms or other methods of\nalerting the nearby residents when leaks or other accidents occur.\n\nSeveral residents in the Sulphur say they received no notice of the leak or\nbecame aware of it via Facebook posts more than an hour after the gas began to\nspread.\n\n\u201cThere should have been alarms, and the whole community should have been\nnotified,\u201d said Roishetta Ozane, a community organizer who lives three miles\nfrom the station. \u201cI don\u2019t trust the system we have at all.\u201d\n\n#### Growing pipelines\n\nThe pipeline, acquired by Exxon when it purchased Denbury last year, is part\nof a 925-mile network stretching through Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.\nAcross the U.S., more than 5,000 miles of pipeline, including the section\nrunning near Sulphur, are primarily used for enhanced oil recovery \u2013 a process\nthat injects pressurized carbon dioxide into old or declining oil reservoirs\nto squeeze out leftover deposits.\n\n#### Sign up for The Truth Dispatch to get New Orleans news in your inbox\nevery Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nMuch of the current and predicted growth in the CO2 pipeline network is linked\nto burgeoning carbon capture technologies, which allow industrial plants to\nstore CO2 underground instead of releasing it into the air. The Biden\nadministration has made carbon capture a key component of its efforts to lower\nemissions. Billions of dollars in federal grants and tax incentives are up for\ngrabs, spurring a host of projects along the Gulf Coast and a vast expansion\nof the CO2 pipeline network.\n\nIllustration by Bethany Atkinson/Deep South Today\n\nCarbon dioxide pipelines could top 65,000 miles \u2013 a thirteenfold increase \u2013 by\n2050, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nSafety regulations aren\u2019t keeping pace, said Kenneth Clarkson, communications\ndirector of the Pipeline Safety Trust. The leak near Sulphur is only the\nlatest mishap in an accident-prone network with weak warning and emergency\nresponse systems, he said.\n\n\u201cThis recent unacceptable leak from another piece of Denbury infrastructure\nhighlights the immediate need for robust and comprehensive carbon dioxide\npipeline safety regulations,\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cThis incident could have been\nmuch worse.\u201d\n\n#### \u2018A stark warning\u2019\n\nLocal firefighters alerted Exxon about the April 3 leak shortly after it was\nfirst reported at around 6 p.m. The company\u2019s Texas-based repair crew arrived\nan hour and a half later. Wearing masks and air tanks, the crew stopped the\nleak just before 8:30 p.m. \u2013 nearly two and a half hours after it was first\nreported, according to records from the Ward Six Fire Protection District in\nCalcasieu Parish. The shelter-in-place advisory was lifted at 9:15 p.m.\n\nNo injuries or serious illnesses were reported, parish officials said.\n\nExxon is still investigating the leak\u2019s cause. In a statement, the company\npromised to \u201clearn from this.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe apologize for any disruption this may have caused,\u201d an Exxon spokesperson\nsaid. \u201cIn response to any incident, our priority is to help maintain the\nsafety of the community, our personnel, and the environment, and we thank all\nfirst responders for their assistance during this event.\u201d\n\nClouds of water vapor and carbon dioxide gas escape from a CO2 pipeline near\nSulphur in southwest Louisiana on April 3, 2024. The harmful gas prompted a\nshelter-in-place advisory and concerns about pipeline safety and warning\nsystems. Photo courtesy of the Ward 6 Fire Protection District\n\nThe pipeline has had several accidental releases, including a 1,000-gallon CO2\nleak at the same location in 2011, according to the Pipeline and Hazardous\nMaterials Safety Administration (PHMSA).\n\nIn 2020, the pipeline had two large-scale leaks in the small Mississippi\ncommunity of Sataria, about 30 miles from Jackson. One rupture, caused by a\nmudslide after a hard rain, forced about 200 Satartia residents to evacuate\nand hospitalized at least 45 people. Emergency responders found people passed\nout or disoriented and struggling to breathe.\n\n\u201cThey found me, my cousin and my brother unconscious, with foam coming out our\nmouths,\u201d said DeEmmeris Burns, who was fishing with family members near the\nSatartia leak when the CO2 cloud reached them. \u201cThey thought we were dead.\u201d\n\nJames Hiatt, a Calcasieu environmental activist, worries about a worse\nincident in Sulphur or elsewhere along the pipeline, which runs through\nseveral parishes.\n\n\u201cThese repeated incidents serve as a stark warning,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial\nthat these risks (aren\u2019t) ignored or minimized.\u201d\n\n#### \u2018There should be alarms for this\u2019\n\nDespite being outside the shelter-in-place radius, Richard suffered headaches\nand drowsiness \u2013 both of which are symptoms of mild CO2 exposure.\n\n\u201cThat night, I got a massive headache, like a migraine,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I\nfelt extremely sleepy, like I\u2019d taken a sleeping pill. I could not get up. I\nfelt...not right.\u201d\n\nMany animals can detect CO2 at lower concentrations than people, which may\nexplain why Richard\u2019s cats ran off. Lab experiments that tested CO2 as a way\nto euthanize animals showed \u201cinnate avoidance\u201d of CO2 at concentrations of\nless than 1%, according to scientists at the University of California,\nBerkeley. Humans can\u2019t smell the gas until it tops 30%.\n\nRichard said she shouldn\u2019t have to rely on her cats to warn her when a\npipeline ruptures.\n\n\u201cThere should be alarms for this,\u201d she said. \u201cI got very upset that most of us\nhad to learn about this on Facebook. Some of the older people around here\naren\u2019t on the Internet.\u201d\n\nSocial media was awash with misinformation about the leak. Residents initially\nadvised each other that the road closure was related to a traffic accident.\nWhen it became clear a pipeline had burst, a few commenters downplayed the\ndanger, saying the gas was harmless or that photos of the leak showed a\nvisible, pale vapor, while CO2 is invisible. But because CO2 pipelines are\npressurized, a rapid gas release can produce a water vapor cloud that can\ntravel separately from the carbon dioxide, according to the American Petroleum\nInstitute.\n\n\u201cIt seemed like nobody knew what was going on until after it was supposedly\nover,\u201d said Cindy Robinson, who lives a mile and a half from the leak. \u201cWe\u2019re\njust not prepared for this kind of accident.\u201d\n\n#### Carbon hub\n\nAlready heavily industrialized, Louisiana\u2019s southwest corner has dozens of\nchemical plants, oil and gas facilities, and a dense network of pipelines. The\nregion is also poised to become a hub for carbon capture and sequestration\nprojects. The Lake Charles area boasts both a dense concentration of carbon-\nproducing facilities and proximity to porous underground rock formations that\ncan store vast quantities of carbon. Companies plan to build many more\npipelines connecting the facilities to sequestration sites.\n\nOzane, the Sulphur community organizer, said PHMSA and other regulators\nshouldn\u2019t permit additional CO2 pipelines until better safeguards are in\nplace.\n\n\u201cHow are they going to manage more pipelines if they can\u2019t safely manage the\npipelines they have already?\u201d she asked.\n\nThe federal government has no specific standards for transporting CO2. The\nrules governing the carbon dioxide pipeline network haven\u2019t undergone\nsignificant review since 1991, according to the Pipeline Safety Trust.\n\nFederal regulators are considering new CO2 pipeline safety rules that could\nrequire leak detection technology and stronger pipeline materials. Details on\nthe proposed rules haven\u2019t yet been released to the public. The process has\nbeen repeatedly pushed back, and it\u2019s unclear when the rules might be\napproved.\n\nEven if new rules are slow-coming, Richard said she\u2019s now far more cognizant\nof the risks in her community. She frequently passed the pipeline in her car\nbut always assumed it was transporting oil \u2013 a substance that\u2019s easier to see,\nsmell and contain during a leak.\n\n\u201cPipelines are just all around us, but I had no clue some of them had this\ngas, and that concerns me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m aware now. That\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\n### Verite News \ud83d\udc99 New Orleans\n\nEarly giving for Give NOLA Day has begun!
