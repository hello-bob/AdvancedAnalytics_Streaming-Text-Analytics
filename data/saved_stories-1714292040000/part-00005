Here we identifiy\nfour dietary subtypes by applying data-driven approaches to food-liking data\nfrom 181,990 UK Biobank participants: \u2018starch-free or reduced-starch\u2019 (subtype\n1), \u2018vegetarian\u2019 (subtype 2), \u2018high protein and low fiber\u2019 (subtype 3) and\n\u2018balanced\u2019 (subtype 4). These subtypes varied in diverse brain health domains.\nThe individuals with a balanced diet demonstrated better mental health and\nsuperior cognitive functions relative to other three subtypes. Compared with\nsubtype 4, subtype 3 displayed lower gray matter volumes in regions such as\nthe postcentral gyrus, while subtype 2 showed higher volumes in thalamus and\nprecuneus. Genome-wide association analyses identified 16 genes different\nbetween subtype 3 and subtype 4, enriched in biological processes related to\nmental health and cognition. These findings provide new insights into\nnaturally developed dietary patterns, highlighting the importance of a\nbalanced diet for brain health.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Fasting-mimicking diet causes hepatic and blood markers changes indicating\nreduced biological age and disease risk\n\nArticle Open access 20 February 2024\n\n### The effects of genetic and modifiable risk factors on brain regions\nvulnerable to ageing and disease\n\nArticle Open access 27 March 2024\n\n### Genome-wide characterization of circulating metabolic biomarkers\n\nArticle Open access 06 March 2024\n\n## Main\n\nFood-liking is a complex trait that reflects the hedonic response to food for\nindividuals^1 and is considered to be the most influential factor driving food\nchoices and intake^2. With an abundance of food choices available worldwide,\npeople naturally develop diverse dietary patterns. Recently, growing evidence\nhas highlighted that the profound impact of dietary patterns on health,\nincluding chronic medical diseases, such as cardiovascular disease^3, type 2\ndiabetes^4, metabolic syndrome^5 and cancer^6, as well as mental health and/or\ncognitive impairments^7,8,9,10, such as major depression disorders and\nanxiety. Understanding how diet preferences affect health, especially brain\nhealth, is critical for developing targeted dietary interventions to promote\nthe consumption of nourishing foods and improve the landscape of brain health.\n\nPrevious evidence has demonstrated a strong link between diet and both\ncognitive functions and mental health. For example, a systematic review\nfocusing on various dietary intake patterns and cognitive functions revealed\nassociations such as increased consumption of simple carbohydrates (for\nexample, sugars) being linked to decreased overall cognitive performance,\nwhile saturated fatty acids were associated with reduced memory and learning.\nConversely, protein intake was found to potentially enhance executive function\nand working memory^7. Furthermore, unhealthy diets have been implicated as a\nrisk factor for a wide range of psychiatric disorders, including major\ndepression disorders^11,12,13, anxiety^14, bipolar disorder^15,16, stroke^17,\nsleep problems^18,19 and Alzheimer\u2019s disease^20. For instance, individuals\nwith a \u2018Western dietary pattern\u2019 (who preferred high sweet and fatty food but\nnot plant-based food) showed a higher incidence of depression^11,12,13\nrelative to those following a balanced diet (including a balanced amount of\nvegetables, fruits, cereals, nuts, seeds, pulses, moderate dairy, eggs and\nfish)^15,21,22,23.\n\nThe linked diet and cognition and mental health might be related to\nalterations in molecular biomarkers as well as changes in brain structure and\nfunctions. Nutrition research suggests that the relationship between dietary\npatterns and mental disorders (or cognitive functions) could be potentially\nmediated by the gut\u2013brain axis. Specific dietary patterns, such as the\n\u2018Western diet\u2019 have the potential to disrupt the balance of gut microbiota,\nleading to inflammation and oxidative stress, which can impair cognitive\nfunction and increase the risk of mental disorders^24,25,26,27. Additionally,\nneuroimaging studies have revealed associations between dietary patterns and\nfunctions and structures in brain regions^28,29,30,31, emphasizing the\nintricate relationship between diet and brain health. For instance, higher\nadherence to the \u2018Mediterranean-type diet\u2019 (characterized by high consumption\nof fruit, vegetables, legumes and cereals, with olive oil as the primary\nsource of fat and a low intake of red meat and poultry) that typically linked\nwith reduced risk of Parkinson\u2019s disease and Alzheimer\u2019s disease was\nassociated with lower reduction of total brain volume over a 3 year period^29,\nas well as with larger cortical thickness in key brain regions, such as the\nentorhinal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex and\ninferior and middle temporal gyrus^31. While previous research has established\nstrong links between dietary and various domains of brain health, the complex\nrelationships and regulation mechanisms underlying different domains of brain\nhealth remain poorly understood.\n\nMoreover, based on the quantities, variety or combination of different foods\nand beverages in diets and the frequency with which they are habitually\nconsumed, several traditional dietary patterns have emerged^32, such as the\n\u2018Western dietary pattern\u2019 and the \u2018Mediterranean dietary pattern\u2019, as\ndescribed above, as well as the \u2018prudent dietary pattern\u2019 (characterized by a\nhigh intake of vegetables, fruit, legumes, whole grains and fish and other\nseafood)^33 and the \u2018vegetarian/plant-based dietary pattern\u2019 (a dietary\npattern that excludes meat, meat-derived foods and, to different extents,\nother animal products)^34. While extensive research has explored the links\nbetween these dietary patterns and brain health, findings across studies are\nnot consistently aligned. For example, some studies associated the vegetarian\ndietary pattern with higher depression and anxiety^35,36, while others found\nthe opposite effect^37,38 or no effect^39,40. This variation may be attributed\nto limited sample sizes and different scopes and criteria used for defining\ndietary patterns. For instance, differences may arise from considerations such\nas whether individuals consuming dairy products are categorized within the\n\u2018vegetarian/plant-based dietary pattern\u2019^34,41. In addition, these studies\ntend to focus on specific populations adhering to a single dietary pattern,\nleaving a critical gap in understanding the relationship between dietary\npatterns and brain health in other populations. Thus, a universally recognized\nand reliable dietary pattern classification system within a large-scale\npopulation is warranted.\n\nIn this Article, to narrow these gaps, the current study leverages the large-\nscale dataset from the UK Biobank and employs data-driven approaches to\nidentify naturally developed dietary patterns and their associations with\ncognitive function, mental health, blood and metabolic biomarkers, brain\nimaging and genomics. Specifically, we first utilized food-liking data from\nthe UK Biobank participants and applied principal component analysis (PCA) and\nhierarchical clustering techniques to develop subtypes of food-liking.\nSubsequently, through one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), we assessed\ndifferences in various brain health domains among these subtypes, including\nmental health, cognitive functions, blood and metabolism biomarkers, and brain\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) traits. We also examined differences among\nthese subtypes by analyzing longitudinal data on mental disorders via Cox\nproportional hazards models. Third, structural equation models (SEMs) were\nemployed to explore the relationships between dietary patterns and different\naspects of brain health. Fourth, genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) and\ngene expression and enrichment analysis were conducted to investigate the\ngenetic underpinnings of distinct subtypes of food-liking and potential\nbiological pathways. This study pioneeringly represents the large-scale\nexploration of food preferences and their comprehensive associations with\nbrain health. By exploring these intricate connections, our research lays the\ngroundwork for further investigations and potential interventions that can\nsignificantly impact human health on a global scale, underscoring the\nimportance of understanding the intricate relationship between diet and brain\nhealth.\n\n## Results\n\n### Distinct food-liking profiles of the four subtypes\n\nA total of 181,990 participants (mean age 70.7 \u00b1 7.7 years and 57.08% female)\nfrom the UK Biobank were included in the identification of food-liking\nsubtypes. Supplementary Fig. 1 provides a general schema of the current study.\nFirst, 140 food and beverage items were classified into ten food categories,\nand PCA was performed separately for each category. Using this approach, we\nobtained a total of 83 principal components, which were used as input for\nhierarchical clustering. The dendrogram of the clustering results showed that\nparticipants could be grouped into four distinct food-liking subtypes (Fig.\n1a), with proportions of 18.09%, 5.54%, 19.39% and 56.98% for subtypes 1 to 4,\nrespectively. The demographic characteristics of the four subtypes were\nsummarized in Supplementary Table 3.\n\nFig. 1: Food-liking profiles of the four subtypes.\n\na, The dendrogram resulting from the hierarchical clustering of food\npreference data from 181,990 participants, revealing four distinct subtypes.\nThe red dashed line indicates the delineation of four subtypes. b, The radar\nchart depicting the preference scores of the ten food categories for each\nsubtype. c, Comparisons between food-liking and food-consumption traits using\nrelative scores of the four subtypes. The selected foods cover a range of\ncategories analyzed in this study. The food-liking measures are shown to be\nclosely related to food consumption. The four identified subtypes include\nsubtype 1, \u2018starch-free or reduced-starch dietary pattern\u2019, subtype 2,\n\u2018vegetarian dietary pattern\u2019, subtype 3, \u2018high protein and low fiber dietary\npattern\u2019 and subtype 4 \u2018balanced dietary pattern\u2019.\n\nFull size image\n\nTo characterize the food preferences of the four subtypes, we generated a\nradar chart to visualize the liking scores of the ten food categories for the\nfour subtypes (Fig. 1b). Subtype 1 showed a higher preference for fruits,\nvegetables and protein foods but a lower preference for starches, which is\nconsistent with a \u2018starch-free or reduced-starch dietary pattern\u2019. Subtype 2\ndisplayed a stronger preference for fruits and vegetables, while showing a\nlower preference for protein foods, which is similar to a \u2018vegetarian dietary\npattern\u2019. Subtype 3 exhibited a greater preference for snacks and protein\nfoods but a lower preference for fruits and vegetables, resembling the \u2018high\nprotein and low fiber dietary pattern\u2019. Finally, subtype 4 showed balanced\npreferences across all food categories, which can be regarded as a \u2018balanced\ndietary pattern\u2019. To further validate the suitability of clustering into four\nsubtypes, we utilized the silhouette criterion^42 to determine the optimal\nnumber of clusters. Our analysis encompassed cluster numbers ranging from two\nto seven, as visualized in Supplementary Fig. 2a. The results indicated that\nthe most suitable numbers of food-liking subtypes did not exceed four. In\naddition to the four subtypes shown in Fig. 1b, we also examined a radar chart\ndepicting three subtypes (Supplementary Fig. 2b). It is noteworthy that one of\nthese three subtypes is a combination of two of the four subtypes (subtype 1\nand subtype 2) displayed in Fig. 1b, while the other two subtypes closely\nresemble two subtypes from Fig. 1b. Furthermore, the radar chart of the four\nsubtypes (Fig. 1b) exhibited distinct food-liking characteristics, indicating\nan intriguing and meaningful dimension to our exploration of dietary patterns\nwithin a large population.\n\nAdditionally, we assessed the robustness of our findings in the context of\ndata imputation by utilizing nonimputed data from 72,419 participants for the\nidentification of food-liking subtypes. The radar chart depicting the four\nsubtypes identified among the 72,419 participants without imputation closely\nmirrored the one generated from the imputed data of 181,990 participants\n(Supplementary Fig. 3a). This consistency indicated the robustness of our\nfindings with data imputation. Moreover, the food preference characteristics\nof the four subtypes, as determined using PCA with explained variance ratios\nof 70% and 90% (Supplementary Fig. 3b,c), both exhibited a strong resemblance\nto the subtypes identified at variance ratios of 80% (Fig. 1b). This finding\nindicated the robustness of the explained variance of the derived components\nand validated the reliability of hierarchical clustering results based on PCA\ncomponents.\n\nTo investigate the potential corresponding relationship between food liking\nand food consumption, we further calculated the average scores for specific\nfood traits within each subtype, covering various food items. These food\ntraits encompassed a variety of categories, including vegetables, fruits,\nseveral types of meat and alcohol, as well as cereal and bread. The results\nrevealed a consistent alignment between the relative scores of the food-liking\nand food-consumption traits across all four subtypes. This congruence in\nscores indicated a robust relationship between individual preferences for\ncertain foods and their actual consumption patterns (Fig. 1c).\n\n### Subtype-specific mental health and cognitive function\n\nBefore one-way ANCOVA analyses, we conducted Levene\u2019s tests to confirm that\nthe data satisfied the assumption of the equality of variances (P > 0.05).\nAfter adjusting for covariates and applying the Bonferroni correction, one-way\nANCOVAs with the factor of subtype revealed significant main effects on seven\nmental health measures, including anxiety symptoms (F = 41.5 and P = 8.9 \u00d7\n10^\u221227), depressive symptoms (F = 71.4 and P = 3.9 \u00d7 10^\u221246), mental distress\n(F = 62.1 and P = 4.0 \u00d7 10^\u221240), psychotic experience (F = 17.4 and P = 2.6 \u00d7\n10^\u221211), self-harm (F = 116.8 and P = 1.6 \u00d7 10^\u221275), trauma (F = 155.4 and P =\n1.6 \u00d7 10^\u2212100) and well-being (F = 256.8 and P = 3.8 \u00d7 10^\u2212166). Figure 2a\ndepicts the subtype-specific patterns of mental health measures. By visual\ninspection, subtype 4 scored the lowest in most mental health measures and the\nhighest in well-being, indicating better mental health conditions. Subtype 2\nand subtype 3 had relatively higher scores in some mental health measures,\nsuch as anxiety and depressive symptoms, and a relatively lower level of well-\nbeing (Fig. 2a).\n\nFig. 2: Subtype-specific patterns of mental health measures, cognitive\nfunction and mental disorder risk.\n\na, The phenotypic differences in mental health (for all mental health\nsymptoms, n = 118,616) and cognitive function, including the symbol\u2013digit\nsubstitution test (n = 93,325), fluid intelligence (n = 96,742), pairs\nmatching (n = 93,394), reaction time (n = 179,740) and trail making (n =\n82,375), among the four subtypes: subtype 1 (S1), \u2018starch-free or reduced-\nstarch dietary pattern\u2019, subtype 2 (S2), \u2018vegetarian dietary pattern\u2019, subtype\n3 (S3), \u2018high protein and low fiber dietary pattern\u2019 and subtype 4 (S4),\n\u2018balanced dietary pattern\u2019. These differences were determined by ANCOVA\nanalyses after Bonferroni correction (\u03b1 = 0.05). The analysis controlled for\nseveral covariates, including age, BMI, education qualificationsf and Townsend\ndeprivation index. For the cognitive tests (including reaction time and trail\nmaking), a lower score indicates better cognitive functions. For the other\ncognitive tests, a higher score indicates better cognitive performance. The\ndata are presented using a violin plot (median point; upper and lower\nquartiles). b, Forest plots depicting Cox proportional hazards models for the\nrisks of mental disorders, including anxiety (n = 152,014), depression (n =\n145,350), eating disorder (n = 165,158) and stroke (n = 152,730), with subtype\n4 as the reference group. The results are presented using HRs and their\ncorresponding 95% CI. The significance of coefficients in the Cox models was\nevaluated using the Wald test (two-tailed P value). The analyses were adjusted\nfor confounding factors, including sex, age, BMI, education qualifications and\nTownsend index, with FDR corrections for multiple comparisons (adjusted P\nvalue <0.05). The horizontal gray dashed line represents no effect (i.e.,\nhazard ratio = 1). The gray dot represents S4 as the reference in the Cox\nmodels.\n\nFull size image\n\nIn addition, similar analysis was conducted for four cognitive functions,\nwhich also exhibited significant main effects on four subtypes, including\nfluid intelligence (F = 15.0 and P = 8.9 \u00d7 10^\u221210), pairs matching (F = 6.6\nand P = 2.0 \u00d7 10^\u22124), reaction time (F = 20.1 and P = 5.2 \u00d7 10^\u221213) and\nsymbol\u2013digit substitution (F = 18.6 and P = 4.9 \u00d7 10^\u221212). Specifically,\nsubtype 4 had the second-highest correct number of symbol digit matches and\nthe lowest reaction time. Subtype 3 showed the highest correct number of\nsymbol digit matches and the second-lowest reaction time (Fig. 2a).\n\nTo further investigate the differences among four subtypes in the risks of\nmental disorders, we employed Cox proportional hazards regression models, with\nsubtype 4 as the reference group. The Cox model results showed significant\ndifferences in the risks of four mental disorders among the four subtypes\nafter false discovery rate (FDR) corrections (adjusted P value <0.05),\nparticularly in anxiety, depression, eating disorder and stroke (Fig. 2b). The\nP values for Schoenfeld\u2019s global test of the Cox models for anxiety and\ndepression were both 0.2, indicating that the proportional hazards assumption\nwas met. The Cox model for stroke satisfied the proportional hazards\nassumption after stratification by age (68 years). Additionally, the Cox model\nfor eating disorder, when stratified by body mass index (BMI, \u226525 kg m^\u22122),\nalso met the proportional hazards assumption. Specifically, when compared with\nsubtype 4, both subtype 2 and subtype 3 exhibited a higher risk for\ndepression, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.18 (95% confidence interval (CI),\n1.04\u20131.33 and adjusted P = 0.03) and 1.22 (95% CI 1.13\u20131.30 and adjusted P =\n3.8 \u00d7 10^\u22127), respectively. However, no significant difference in HRs for this\nmental disorder was found between subtype 1 and subtype 4. Furthermore,\nsubtype 1 and subtype 3 displayed higher risks than subtype 4 for stroke, with\nHRs of 1.13 (95% CI 1.03\u20131.24 and adjusted P = 0.03) and 1.21 (95% CI\n1.11\u20131.31 and adjusted P = 2.3 \u00d7 10^\u22125), respectively. However, no significant\ndifference in HRs for this mental disorder was observed between subtype 2 and\nsubtype 4. Additionally, all three subtypes, when compared with subtype 4,\nexhibited higher risks for anxiety (subtype 1, HR 1.09, 95% CI 1.0\u20131.17 and\nadjusted P = 0.03; subtype 2, HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.14\u20131.41 and adjusted P = 6.2 \u00d7\n10^\u22125; subtype 3, HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.15\u20131.31 and adjusted P = 3.2 \u00d7 10^\u22129) and\neating disorder, with subtype 2 showing particularly significant risk (subtype\n1, HR 1.86, 95% CI 1.45\u20132.38 and adjusted P = 9.1 \u00d7 10^\u22126; subtype 2, HR 2.68,\n95% CI 2.00\u20133.58 and adjusted P = 9.7 \u00d7 10^\u221210; subtype 3, HR 1.96, 95% CI\n1.48\u20132.59 and adjusted P = 2.0 \u00d7 10^\u22125).\n\n### Distinctive blood and metabolic biomarker across subtypes\n\nThe one-way ANCOVA analyses revealed that 167 of 229 blood and metabolomic\nbiomarkers (32 blood biomarkers and 135 metabolomic biomarkers) were\nsignificantly different between the four subtypes after Bonferroni correction\n(P < 0.05/229) (Fig. 3a). The data satisfied the assumption of the equality of\nvariances and the results were adjusted for covariates. The top 10% of\nsignificant biomarkers included the following categories: fatty acids (for\nexample, docosahexaenoic acid (F = 312.5 and P = 1.1 \u00d7 10^\u2212200) omega-3 fatty\nacids (F = 232.4 and P = 1.4 \u00d7 10^\u2212149) and omega-6 fatty acids (F = 18.4 and\nP = 6.1 \u00d7 10^\u221212)), amino acids (for example, glycine (F = 122.1 and P = 1.0 \u00d7\n10^\u221280)), renal function (for example, urea (F = 114.8 and P = 5.2 \u00d7 10^\u221274)),\ncholesteryl esters (for example, cholesteryl esters in large high-density\nlipoprotein (HDL) (F = 76.1 and P = 4.1 \u00d7 10^\u221249)), cholesterol (for example,\ncholesterol in large HDL (F = 75.5 and P = 1.0 \u00d7 10^\u221248)), lipoprotein\nparticle concentrations (for example, concentration of large HDL particles (F\n= 73.5 and P = 2.0 \u00d7 10^\u221247)), free cholesterol (for example, free cholesterol\nin HDL (F = 72.9 and P = 4.9 \u00d7 10^\u221247)), total lipids (for example, total\nlipids in large HDL (F = 72.2 and P = 1.5 \u00d7 10^\u221246)) and phospholipids (for\nexample, phospholipids in large HDL (F = 70.1 and P = 3.4 \u00d7 10^\u221245)).\n\nFig. 3: Differences in blood and metabolic biomarkers, as well as brain\nmorphology and white matter integrity across the four subtypes.\n\na, Manhattan plot of the one-way ANCOVA analyses (F-tests) for 24 categories\nof blood and metabolic biomarkers. The height of each point represents the\nnegative logarithm of the P value of the F-test, with the color bar indicating\nthe different biomarker categories. The black dashed line represents the\nBonferroni threshold for multiple comparisons (\u03b1 = 0.05), and the top 15% of\nbiomarkers that exhibited significant differences after Bonferroni correction\n(P < 0.05/229) are labeled using text annotations. The analysis was adjusted\nfor covariates, including age, BMI, education qualifications and Townsend\ndeprivation index. b, Brain regions that significantly differ in GMV, mean FA\nand MD among the four subtypes identified in the one-way ANCOVA analyses\n(F-tests). Multiple comparisons were corrected using FDR correction (adjusted\nP value <0.05). The analyses were adjusted for age, BMI, education\nqualifications, Townsend deprivation index, scanning sites and intracranial\nvolume (the latter only for the analysis of GMV). The results of post hoc\ntests (two-tailed t-tests) on GMV, mean FA, and mean MD comparing subtype 1\n(S1, \u2018starch-free or reduced-starch dietary pattern\u2019), subtype 2 (S2,\n\u2018vegetarian dietary pattern\u2019) and subtype 3 (S3, \u2018high protein and low fiber\ndietary pattern\u2019) against subtype 4 (S4, \u2018balanced dietary pattern\u2019), with FDR\ncorrection for multiple comparisons (adjusted P value <0.05). The same\ncovariates were regressed out in the post hoc tests as in the ANCOVAs.\n\nFull size image\n\nPost hoc analysis further revealed that 127 of 167 blood and metabolomic\nbiomarkers were significantly different between subtype 3 and subtype 4 after\nBonferroni correction (P < 0.05/(167 \u00d7 3)) (Supplementary Fig. 4c), with most\nof them being lower in subtype 3. The top 10% of significant biomarkers\nincluded fatty acids (for example, docosahexaenoic acid (t = \u221225.7, Cohen\u2019s d\n= \u22120.3 and P = 3.7 \u00d7 10^\u2212144) and omega-3 fatty acids (t = \u221221.3, Cohen\u2019s d =\n\u22120.3 and P = 6.4 \u00d7 10^\u2212100)), cholesteryl esters (for example, cholesteryl\nesters in HDL (t = \u221214.2, Cohen\u2019s d = \u22120.2 and P = 6.2 \u00d7 10^\u221246)) and\ncholesterol (for example, HDL cholesterol, t = \u221214.3, Cohen\u2019s d = \u22120.2 and P =\n1.7 \u00d7 10^\u221246)).\n\nCompared with subtype 4, subtype 1 also showed significantly different in 49\nblood and metabolomic biomarkers (Supplementary Fig. 4a), with most of them\nbeing higher in subtype 1 (Supplementary Fig. 4a), such as fatty acids (for\nexample, degree of unsaturation (t = 8.7, Cohen\u2019s d = 0.1 and P = 4.0 \u00d7\n10^\u221218) and docosahexaenoic acid (t = 6.3, Cohen\u2019s d = 0.1 and P = 3.8 \u00d7\n10^\u221210)). Some biomarkers showed lower levels in subtype 1, such as\nphospholipids (for example, phospholipids in small HDL (t = \u22125.8, Cohen\u2019s d =\n\u22120.1 and P = 8.9 \u00d7 10^\u22129)), fatty acids (for example, saturated fatty acid\n(Cohen\u2019s d = \u22120.1, t = \u22125.3 and P = 9.9 \u00d7 10^\u22128)) and total lipids (for\nexample, total lipids in small HDL (t = \u22125.5, Cohen\u2019s d = \u22120.1 and P = 3.2 \u00d7\n10^\u22128)).\n\nThe results comparing of subtype 2 with subtype 4 were slightly different from\nthose of comparing subtype 3 (or subtype 1) and subtype 4 (Supplementary Fig.\n4b). After Bonferroni correction, 72 of the 167 blood and metabolomic\nbiomarkers were found to be significantly different between subtype 2 and\nsubtype 4 (P < 0.05/(167 \u00d7 3)). The top 10% of significant biomarkers were\nrenal function (for example, urea (t = \u221218.7, Cohen\u2019s d = \u22120.4 and P = 2.5 \u00d7\n10^\u221277)), amino acids (for example, glycine (t = 18.9, Cohen\u2019s d = 0.4 and P =\n3.1 \u00d7 10^\u221279)) and fatty acids (for example, omega-3 fatty acids (t = \u221214.4,\nCohen\u2019s d = \u22120.3 and P = 8.7 \u00d7 10^\u221247)).

The\nassumption of the equality of variances were satisfied for conducting one-way\nANCOVAs (P > 0.05). These regions included the postcentral gyrus, caudate,\nputamen, parahippocampal gyrus and so on. Post hoc analysis further revealed\nsignificant differences in 16 out of the 23 brain regions between subtype 3\nand subtype 4 after FDR correction (adjusted P value <0.05), among which 11\nbrain regions showed significantly lower in subtype 3, such as postcentral\ngyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, and inferior parietal gyrus (Fig. 3b).\nAdditionally, subtype 1 showed significant differences compared with subtype 4\nin seven regions, including the putamen, caudate, pallidum and paracentral\nlobule (Fig. 3b). Only four brain regions (thalamus, precuneus and paracentral\nlobule) were found to be significantly different between subtype 2 and subtype\n4 after FDR correction (adjusted P value <0.05), which exhibited higher in\nsubtype 2 (Fig. 3b). The complete statistical results for the analyses of the\ngray matter volume (GMV) are provided in Supplementary Tables 8 and 9.\n\nMoreover, we performed analogous analyses on the diffusion tensor imaging\nmeasures of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) for the 48\nwhite matter tracts within the John\u2019s Hopkins University (JHU) ICBM-DTI-81\nwhite-matter labels atlas. Our results revealed, for the FA measurements,\neight brain regions of interest (ROIs) differed significantly across the four\nsubtypes after FDR correction with an adjusted P value <0.05 (Fig. 3b). These\nROIs included the medial lemniscus, uncinate fasciculus and external capsule\nand so on. Post hoc analyses revealed significant differences in FA measures\nof seven ROIs between subtype 3 and subtype 4 after FDR correction (adjusted P\nvalue <0.05), with all these ROIs exhibiting lower FA values in subtype 3.\nAdditionally, the cingulum hippocampus was the only region that showed\nsignificant differences between subtype 1 and subtype 4, with higher FA values\nin subtype 1. The uncinate fasciculus was the only region that exhibited\nsignificant differences between subtype 2 and subtype 4, with higher FA values\nin subtype 2 (Fig. 3b).\n\nIn terms of the MD measures, we found that 11 ROIs were significantly\ndifferent across four subtypes, including external capsule, anterior limb of\nthe internal capsule, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus and so on (Fig.\n3b). Post hoc analysis of comparison of subtype 3 and subtype 4 mirrored these\nbrain regions after FDR correction (adjusted P value <0.05), with higher MD\nvalues in all of these ROIs in subtype 3. Also, three ROIs showed significant\ndifferences between subtype 1 and subtype 4, such as the superior fronto-\noccipital fasciculus, anterior limb of the internal capsule and external\ncapsule (Fig. 3b), with higher MD values in subtype 1. Only the cerebral\npeduncle was found to be significantly different between subtype 2 and subtype\n4, with higher MD values in subtype 2. Complete statistical results for the\nANCOVA analyses and post hoc tests of FA and MD measures can be found in\nSupplementary Tables 10\u201313.\n\n### Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for mental disorders across subtypes\n\nAfter adjusting covariates and applying the Bonferroni correction (P <\n0.05/8), one-way ANCOVA analyses on eight PRSs of mental disorders revealed\nsignificant main effects across four subtypes (Fig. 5d), including a PRS for\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (F = 8.2 and P = 1.9 \u00d7 10^\u22125), ischemic stroke (F = 8.3\nand P = 1.7 \u00d7 10^\u22125), Parkinson\u2019s disease (F = 6.7 and P = 1.7 \u00d7 10^\u22124),\ncardiovascular disease (F = 6.0 and P = 4.2 \u00d7 10^\u22124), bipolar disorder (F =\n34.1 and P = 4.8 \u00d7 10^\u221222), schizophrenia (F = 72.4 and P = 8.7 \u00d7 10^\u221247),\ndepression (F = 11.5 and P = 1.5 \u00d7 10^\u22127) and suicide attempt (F = 6.4 and P =\n2.5 \u00d7 10^\u22124). Levene\u2019s tests confirmed that the data satisfied the assumption\nof the equality of variances (P > 0.05). Specifically, subtype 2 showed a\nhigher genetic predisposition for several mental disorders, including\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and\nsuicide attempts, than other subtypes, mirroring the comparisons on mental\nhealth measures (\u2018Differences in neuroimaging phenotypes across subtypes\u2019\nsection). In addition, subtype 3 presented a high genetic susceptibility to\nischemic stroke, whereas subtype 4 showed relatively lower genetic risks for\nmost mental disorders, which was consistent with the results on mental health\nmeasures (\u2018Differences in neuroimaging phenotypes across subtypes\u2019 section).\n\n### Complex interplay of food preferences and other phenotypes\n\nTo examine the complex relationships among food preference, mental health,\ncognitive function and brain MRI features, we constructed three SEMs with\nsubtype 4 as the reference group. In the model that compared the food\npreference of subtype 3 with that of subtype 4, we selected those latent\nvariables that were significantly different between subtype 3 and subtype 4.\nSpecifically, the mental health measures encompassed anxiety symptoms (\u03b2 =\n0.63 and P < 0.001), depressive symptoms (\u03b2 = 0.73 and P < 0.001), self-harm\n(\u03b2 = 0.54 and P < 0.001), trauma (\u03b2 = 0.55 and P < 0.001) and well-being (\u03b2 =\n\u22120.57 and P < 0.001). The cognitive function was characterized by fluid\nintelligence, reaction time and symbol\u2013digit substitution (\u03b2 = 0.38 and \u22120.20\nand 0.67, respectively; P < 0.001). The brain MRI traits included the GMV of\nthe top ten brain regions, the mean FA of all seven white matter tracts and\nthe mean MD of the top ten white matter tracts. Figure 4c depicts the\ndirectional association results. The food preference was significantly\nassociated with mental health measurements (\u03b2 = 0.052 and P_adj = 5.5 \u00d7\n10^\u22126), brain MRI traits (\u03b2 = \u22120.037 and P_adj = 4.6 \u00d7 10^\u22124) and cognitive\nfunction (\u03b2 = 0.077 and P_adj = 3.5 \u00d7 10^\u22128). Additionally, brain MRI traits\nand mental health were significant predictors for cognitive functions (\u03b2 =\n0.098 and P_adj = 9.2 \u00d7 10^\u221211 and \u03b2 = \u22120.117 and P_adj = 1.1 \u00d7 10^\u221212,\nrespectively). The brain MRI traits significantly predicted mental health (\u03b2 =\n\u22120.058 and P_adj = 1.5 \u00d7 10^\u22126). The root mean square error of approximation\n(RMSEA) of this SEM model was 0.1.\n\nFig. 4: Directional associations among food preference, mental health,\ncognitive function and brain MRI trait.\n\na, The results of a structural equation model comparing subtype 1 (S1,\n\u2018starch-free or reduced-starch dietary pattern\u2019) to subtype 4 (S4, \u2018balanced\ndietary pattern\u2019). The analysis revealed that food preference was\nsignificantly associated with mental health (\u03b2 = 0.029 and P_adj = 0.009) and\nbrain MRI trait (\u03b2 = 0.041 abd P_adj = 6.1 \u00d7 10^\u22125). Mental health\nsignificantly predicted cognitive function (\u03b2 = \u22120.061 and P_adj = 0.03). b,c,\nThe structural equation model for subtype 2 (S2, \u2018vegetarian dietary pattern\u2019)\n(b) and subtype 3 (S3, \u2018high protein and low fiber dietary pattern\u2019) (c)\nversus subtype 4, respectively. All associations were in the expected\ndirection, and all paths in the model for subtype 3 versus subtype 4 were\nsignificant. Wald tests were utilized to derive the two-sided P values of the\nstandardized coefficients adjusted for multiple comparisons (FDR correction).\nThe significance levels of the standardized coefficients are indicated by\n*P_adj <0.05, **P_adj <0.01 and ***P_adj <0.001. n.s., not significant.\n\nFull size image\n\nThe SEM model with comparison of subtype 1 and subtype 4 (Fig. 4a) showed that\nfood preference was significantly associated with mental health (\u03b2 = 0.029 and\nP_adj = 0.009) and brain MRI trait (\u03b2 = 0.041 and P_adj = 6.1 \u00d7 10^\u22125). Mental\nhealth was also a significant predictor for cognitive function (\u03b2 = \u22120.061 and\nP_adj = 0.03). The RMSEA of this model was 0.1. In addition, the SEM model\nwith comparison of subtype 2 and subtype 4 showed that food preference was\nsignificantly associated with mental health (\u03b2 = 0.084 and P_adj = 3.7 \u00d7\n10^\u221212) and brain MRI trait (\u03b2 = 0.036 and P_adj = 0.002). The brain MRI\ntraits significantly predicted mental health (\u03b2 = \u22120.027 and P_adj = 0.03).\nBoth brain MRI trait and mental health significantly predicted cognitive\nfunction (\u03b2 = 0.094 and P_adj = 1.7 \u00d7 10^\u22128 and \u03b2 = \u22120.115 and P_adj = 1.5 \u00d7\n10^\u221210, respectively). The RMSEA of this model was 0.05, which indicated a\ngood fit (Fig. 4b).\n\nAll observed associations in these three path models were in the expected\ndirection, with most paths being significant after FDR correction. The\nloadings of the latent variables in these SEM models can be found in\nSupplementary Table 14.\n\n### GWAS for four subtypes\n\nTo explore the genetic underpinnings of distinct subtypes of food-liking, we\nperformed three case\u2013control GWAS analysis, with subtype 4 as the reference\ngroup. As depicted in Fig. 5a, the GWAS-identified 1,266 single-nucleotide\npolymorphisms (SNPs) that were significantly different between subtype 3 and\nsubtype 4 (P < 5 \u00d7 10^\u22128). These SNPs were mostly located on chromosomes 2, 3,\n13 and 17, such as rs36164224 (chromosome 2 (odds ratio (OR) of 1.07 and P =\n8.6 \u00d7 10^\u221210)), rs62250502 (chromosome 3 (OR of 0.93 and P = 1.3 \u00d7 10^\u221211)),\nrs3124402 (chromosome 13 (OR of 0.92 and P = 2.5 \u00d7 10^\u221211)) and rs2532387\n(chromosome 17 (OR of 1.07 and P = 1.2 \u00d7 10^\u22128)). Additionally, we found that\ntwo SNPs were significantly different between subtype 1 and subtype 4 (P < 5 \u00d7\n10^\u22128), namely rs2622068 and rs11939395, located on chromosome 4. Furthermore,\nno SNPs were observed to be significantly different between subtype 2 and\nsubtype 4. The summarized GWAS results for subtype 3 versus subtype 4 were\nprovided in Supplementary Data Table 1.\n\nFig. 5: GWAS-identified genetic variants, distinctive gene expression patterns\nand enriched functions between subtype 3 (\u2018high protein and low fiber dietary\npattern\u2019) and subtype 4 (\u2018balanced dietary pattern\u2019).\n\na, Manhattan plot for the case\u2013control GWAS analysis comparing subtypes 3\n(cases, n = 35,178) and subtype 4 (controls, n = 103,474).

Gene expression analysis\nbased on the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx v8 54 tissue types) dataset\nrevealed a cluster of genes, including MAPT, MVB12B and NSF, which exhibited\nhigh expression in several brain tissues, such as the anterior cingulate\ncortex (BA24), frontal cortex (BA9), amygdala and hippocampus and so on (Fig.\n5b). Moreover, the CADM2, CRHR1, MEIS1, PLEKHM1 and KANSL1 genes also showed\nhigh expression in the cerebellar hemisphere and cerebellum (Fig. 5b).\n\nFurthermore, after Benjamini\u2013Hochberg FDR corrections (adjusted P value\n<0.05), the identified 16 genes were found to converge on specific biological\nprocesses associated with mental health, cognitive functions and brain\ntissues, particularly within the context of the gene sets derived from the\nGWAS catalog (Fig. 5c). For instance, the MAPT, STH, ARL17B, LRRC37A,\nLRRC37A2, ARL17A and WNT3 genes were most prominently enriched for handedness\n(P_adj = 1.0 \u00d7 10^\u221211), whereas some genes were enriched for mental disorders,\nsuch as alcohol use disorder (PLEKHM1, CRHR1, SPPL2C, MAPT, STH and WNT3;\nP_adj = 1.8 \u00d7 10^\u221211), Parkinson\u2019s disease (ARHGAP27, PLEKHM1, CRHR1, SPPL2C,\nMAPT, STH and WNT3; P_adj = 5.5 \u00d7 10^\u22129) and Alzheimer\u2019s disease in APOE\n\\\\(\\varepsilon 4\\\\) carriers (CRHR1, MAPT and WNT3; P_adj = 4.3 \u00d7 10^\u22124).\nAdditionally, some genes were enriched for cognitive functions, such as\nreaction time (MAPT, ARL17B, LRRC37A, LRRC37A2, ARL17A and WNT3; P_adj = 3.5 \u00d7\n10^\u22126). Moreover, some genes converged on brain tissues, such as brain\nmorphology (ARHGAP27, PLEKHM1, CRHR1, SPPL2C, MAPT, STH, ARL17B, LRRC37A,\nLRRC37A2, ARL17A and WNT3; P_adj = 3.5 \u00d7 10^\u22126), intracranial volume (CRHR1,\nMAPT and STH; P_adj = 4.0 \u00d7 10^\u22126), cortical surface area (ARHGAP27, CRHR1 and\nWNT3; P_adj = 4.0 \u00d7 10^\u22126) and subcortical region volumes (CRHR1, MAPT and\nSTH; P_adj = 3.9 \u00d7 10^\u22125).\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn this study, we investigated naturally developed dietary patterns based on\nfood-liking data from a large UK Biobank cohort (n = 181,990). Remarkably,\nthis study represents a large-scale exploration of food preferences and their\nimportant implications for brain health. By employing data-driven approaches,\nwe achieved a reliable and robust classification of dietary patterns. Our\nanalyses identified four distinct dietary subtypes, each characterized by a\nunique dietary profile: subtype 1 (\u2018starch-free or reduced-starch dietary\npattern\u2019), subtype 2 (\u2018vegetarian dietary pattern\u2019), subtype 3 (\u2018high protein\nand low fiber dietary pattern\u2019) and subtype 4 (\u2018balanced dietary pattern\u2019).\n\nFirst, the current study provides a comprehensive understanding of the\nassociations between data-driven dietary patterns and brain health, blood and\nmetabolism and genetics. Our study has shed light on a coherent mediated\npathway linking food preferences, brain MRI traits, cognition and mental\nhealth via structural equation modeling. A noteworthy finding of our study is\nthe potential impact of food preferences on brain structure. We observed that\nindividuals with specific food preferences displayed distinct patterns of\nbrain MRI traits. These differential brain structural patterns may play an\nimportant role in shaping cognitive function and mental health outcomes^43,44.\nThe plasticity and adaptability of the brain, influenced by dietary choices,\ncan lead to structural changes that influence cognitive functions and mental\nhealth^43,44. Moreover, our results suggest a directional relationship between\nmental health and cognitive function. Mental health not only impacts cognitive\nabilities but is also influenced by brain structure. The intricate interplay\nbetween these factors underscores the importance of considering mental health\nas a crucial determinant in understanding brain health and cognitive\nperformance^45.\n\nSecond, we revealed significant differences in mental health and cognitive\nfunction across four subtypes. Individuals in subtype 2, who consumed more\nvegetables and fruits, exhibited relatively higher levels of mental health\nscores, such as anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, mental distress,\npsychotic experience, self-harm and trauma and a relatively lower well-being\nscore. The association between vegetarian (or vegan) diets and mental health\nin previous literature have been found to be controversial. Some\ninvestigations have reported positive associations of vegetarian and vegan\ndiets with diverse mental health^35,36,46,47,48,49,50,51, while other studies\nfound an inverse association^37,38,52,53 or no associations^39,40. The\nconflicting findings can be attributed to differences in study designs (for\nexample, cross-sectional, retrospective and randomized controlled trial),\nvariations in how vegetarian and vegan diets were defined (with some of the\nstudies including the consumption of fish or chicken also as vegetarian),\ndiscrepancies in the duration of adopting such diets, variations in the timing\nand methods used to assess mental health^52 and the unique characteristics of\nthe groups studied (that is, biological sex). It should be noted that our\nobservational study cannot draw a causal conclusion that vegetarianism leads\nto mental health problems. Particularly, our genetic analyses showed that\nindividuals adopting the vegetarian dietary pattern exhibited higher PRSs in\nmental health, so it is possible that the worsened mental health conditions in\nsubtype 2 may be indirectly influenced by the heightened genetic\nsusceptibility. Further investigations are imperative in this regard to\nestablish a causal conclusion in the future.\n\nSubtype 3, which followed an unhealthy \u2018high protein and low fiber dietary\npattern\u2019, had lower well-being scores than other subtypes. This finding was\nconsistent with previous research that linked dietary quality with well-\nbeing^54,55 demonstrated that exposure to fast food images potentially\nimpacting well-being^56. In contrast, subtype 4, which followed a balanced and\nhealthy dietary pattern, had less mental health problems and a higher well-\nbeing score than other subtypes, suggesting that a balanced intake of various\nfood categories may be associated with better mental health^57,58. Note that\nthe Cox proportional hazards regression models further support the one-way\nANCOVAs. Compared with subtype 4, subtype 3 had higher risks for anxiety,\ndepression and stroke. Individuals, such as in subtype 3, who exhibit a higher\nintake of fatty meat may experience elevated stress levels and a higher risk\nof mental disorders, as reported in previous studies on the relationship\nbetween diet, stress and mental health^59. Such effects could be attributed to\nan upsurge in the release of inflammatory factors and the permeation of gut\nflora through the intestinal wall, which is caused by high-fat foods. Our\nfindings on blood and metabolic biomarkers revealed that higher levels of\nC-reactive protein and white blood cell count in subtype 3, compared with\nsubtype 4, further support this point. These mechanisms may amplify the\nsusceptibility to stress and depression by modifying signaling pathways\nleading to the brain^60,61. This was also confirmed in previous studies which\nshowed that an unbalanced diet may associate with a higher risk of mental\ndisorders^15,62, and meat-eaters may have a higher risk for stroke^63.\n\nInterestingly, the PRSs for various mental disorders mirrored the pattern.\nSubtype 2 displayed a heightened genetic susceptibility to a range of mental\ndisorders, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, bipolar\ndisorder, schizophrenia and suicide attempt, compared with other subtypes,\nwhile subtype 4 demonstrated relatively lower PRS risks for most mental\ndisorders and related conditions. These results provide additional insights\ninto the elevated risks of mental disorders for subtype 2 from a genetic\nstandpoint. In other words, the higher mental health scores (for example,\nself-harm) as well as the lower cognitive performances scores observed in\nsubtype 2 individuals might potentially be linked to their elevated genetic\nsusceptibility to mental disorders (for example, PRSs for suicide attempts).\nIn contrast, the relatively higher mental health symptoms in subtype 3\nindividuals, particularly as revealed in the Cox analysis, might be more\nstrongly associated with their dietary habits rather than the genetic risks.\nAdditionally, subtype 4 had the shortest reaction time, which may be\nattributed to their balanced dietary pattern^7.\n\nThird, the associations between dietary patterns and brain morphology and\nwhite matter integrity are evident. Specifically, compared with subtype 4,\nsubtype 3 had significantly lower GMV in 11 brain regions, including the\npostcentral gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, inferior parietal gyrus, middle\ntemporal gyrus, middle cingulate gyrus and so on. These findings were\nconsistent with previous research that linked a \u2018healthier\u2019 diet (that is,\nrich in vegetables, vitamins, antioxidants and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty\nacids or fish intake) with higher total GMV and the volumes of the\nhippocampus, cingulate gyrus, entorhinal cortex, temporal lobe and parietal\nlobe^28,29,64,65. In contrast, diets high in saturated and trans fats and\nprotein were associated with smaller GMV^66. Our study also revealed\nsignificant differences in mean FA and MD of white matter tracts between\nsubtype 3 and subtype 4. Higher MD and lower FA values are typically\nindicative of impaired fiber integrity due to increased diffusion and loss of\ncoherence on preferred movement direction^67. Subtype 4 showed higher FA than\nsubtype 3 in seven brain regions, including the medial lemniscus, external\ncapsule, uncinate fasciculus and so on. This findings further complemented the\nconclusions of previous studies, which suggested that a health-aware diet was\nassociated with improved global white matter connectivity, as indicated by\nhigher FA values^68. Furthermore, compared with subtype 4, subtype 3 showed\nhigher MD in 11 ROIs, including the external capsule, anterior limb of the\ninternal capsule, hippocampal cingulum and so on. Overall, these regions were\ninvolved in emotional, motivational and cognitive and memory functions, as\nwell as sensory and motor systems^69,70,71. For example, the anterior limb of\nthe internal capsule carries fibers from prefrontal cortical regions was\nassociated with emotion, motivation, cognition and decision making^69,72,\nwhile the hippocampal cingulum is a major pathway connecting the cingulate\ngyrus to the hippocampal formation and is related to learning and memory\nfunctions^73. In addition, subtype 2 had higher MD in the cerebral peduncle\nthan subtype 4. The cerebral peduncle was associated with motor and sensory\nfunctions^74,75. However, there is no conclusive evidence to establish the\ncorrelation between vegetarian diets and motor or sensory deficits.\n\nFourth, the blood and metabolic biomarkers examined in this study appear to be\nsensitive indicators of the impact of dietary patterns on the body. Our\nfindings indicated that the four subtypes have significantly different levels\nof several biomarkers, such as omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids^76,77, which\nare important components involved in serotonin synthesis. Additionally,\nsubtype 4, characterized by a diet that is generally considered to be\nhealthier, exhibited higher levels of certain biomarkers than subtype 3, such\nas the degree of unsaturation in a fatty acid, HDL cholesterol, total lipids\nin HDL and so on. These results was consistent with previous investigations,\nwhich suggested that a balanced diet pattern was associated with higher HDL\ncholesterol levels in the elderly population^78. Furthermore, in comparison\nwith subtype 4, subtype 2 and subtype 3 both exhibited significantly lower\nlevels of certain crucial fatty acids such as omega-3 fatty acids, which\npotentially be attributed to the lack of fish consumption in the latter\nsubtype.\n\nFinally, the case\u2013control GWAS-identified 1,266 SNPs that differed between\nsubtype 3 and subtype 4, and these were subsequently mapped to 16 genes. Our\ngene expression analysis pinpointed a cluster of genes, including notable\ncandidates such as MAPT, MVB12B and NSF, which exhibited elevated expression\nacross multiple brain tissues, encompassing regions such as the anterior\ncingulate cortex (BA24), frontal cortex (BA9), amygdala and hippocampus, among\nothers. Intriguingly, many of these brain regions with potentially high gene\nexpression overlap with the findings from our comparison of two subtypes based\non GMV. This convergence supports the hypothesis that these genes play a\ncrucial role in brain structure and may modulate the impact of dietary\npatterns on brain health^28,29,64,65. Moreover, the identified genes were also\nfound to be enriched in specific biological processes related to mental\ndisorders and cognition, such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease in\nAPOE \u03b54 carriers and cognitive performance (reaction time). This further\nsubstantiates the potential link between dietary patterns and brain function\nand brain health^79,80. Furthermore, we performed supplementary GWAS and PRS\nanalyses to explore the predictive potential of genetics on brain MRI data and\nmental health within each dietary pattern. The GWAS analyses involved\nparticipants without MRI data, comparing other subtypes to subtype 4.\nSubsequently, PRSs were computed using genetic data from participants with MRI\ndata, at P value thresholds of 0.01, 0.05 and 0.5. Similar analyses were\nconducted for mental health symptoms. However, after Bonferroni correction, no\nsignificant correlations were observed between brain MRI data and PRSs\n(Supplementary Fig. 5), or between mental health symptoms and PRSs\n(Supplementary Fig. 6). Integrating these supplementary analyses on PRSs\nrelated to dietary patterns with the evidence from GWAS, gene expression and\nfunctional enrichment analyses in our current study, we suggest a potential\nassociation between diet-related genes, brain function and mental health, but\ngenes demonstrate a limited capacity to directly predict brain MRI data and\nmental health symptoms.\n\nThere are several highlights and substantial contributions of this study that\nare worth discussion. A key strength of the current research lies in its\npioneering application of data-driven methods to analyze food preference data\nand identify naturally developed dietary patterns within a large-scale\npopulation. Previous studies have often utilized predefined dietary patterns,\nsuch as the Mediterranean or Western diet based on self-reported\nsurveys^20,81,82,83. However, the adopted definition and application of\ndietary patterns were not consistent across studies. In contrast, our study\nestablished a reliable classification system for dietary patterns by using a\ndata-driven approach without prior assumptions and definitions. The identified\ndietary patterns reflect the usual eating habits in normal life, which can\nlead to meaningful investigations of their associations with brain structure\nand health. Another key strength of our study lies in the integration of\nmultiple-dimensional data with a large sample size (including mental health\nmeasures, cognitive function, blood and metabolic biomarkers and genomics),\nwhich provides insights into the association between naturally developed\ndietary patterns by food preferences and brain health.\n\nOur study has several implications for future research and clinical practice.\nFirst, our findings underscore the importance of considering dietary factors\nwhen examining brain structure, cognitive and mental health outcomes. Future\nstudies could explore the mechanisms underlying these relationships, such as\nthe potential role of specific nutrients or dietary patterns. Second, our\nstudy highlights the potential utility of using food preferences as a marker\nfor identifying individuals at risk of cognitive impairment and mental health\nproblems, which could be useful in developing targeted interventions and\npersonalized dietary recommendations to promote brain health. The importance\nof our study lie in its pioneering exploration of food preferences and their\nprofound impact on the brain, cognition, mental health and overall well-being.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the large-scale investigation of its\nkind, representing a novel advancement in our understanding of the intricate\nrelationship between diet and various aspects of human health. These findings\nalso carry practical implications for educational practices. Early-age\neducation in schools aimed at promoting healthy food preferences can play a\nvital role in fostering good brain health, cognition and overall well-being\nthroughout the life of an individual. By nurturing healthy dietary habits from\nan early stage, we have the potential to positively impact public health and\nempower individuals to lead healthier and high-quality lives.\n\nHowever, our study also has several limitations. First, it is important to\nnote that the dietary patterns identified in the current study were based on\ndata related to food-liking rather than actual food consumption. While our\nresults have shown that food-liking measures were closely related to food\nconsumption, subtle differences may exist and could influence the observed\nrelationships. Second, participants included in this study are primarily\nhealthy individuals from the UK Biobank. Given that the UK Biobank is known to\nhave a \u2018healthy volunteer\u2019 selection bias^84, our results may not be entirely\ngeneralizable to other populations. Third, we observed demographic differences\n(for example, age, BMI, Townsend deprivation index and education\nqualifications) between respondents and nonrespondents to the food-liking\nquestionnaire in the entire UK Biobank population. These disparities may arise\nfrom the substantial UKB sample, which may involve the selection criteria.\nNotably, despite the observed demographic disparities, our study demonstrates\nthat this largest-scale food-liking dataset can effectively unveil robust and\nreliable food-liking subtypes. Fourth, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids^76,77,\nalong with tryptophan^85, constitute key components in serotonin synthesis.\nWhile our findings revealed significant differences in omega-3 and omega-6\nfatty acids among the four subtypes, a potential limitation is that we did not\naccount for the actual levels of tryptophan, as well as a lack of detailed\ninformation on involvements of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids in these\ndietary patterns. Considering the pivotal role of serotonin in mood regulation\nand its substantial impact on overall mental health, future research should\nincorporate these aspects for a more comprehensive understanding. Finally, we\nused simplified measures to assess mental health factors, including well-\nbeing. Though brief measures are pragmatic for large-scale studies and have\ndemonstrated reliability and validity in previous research^86,87,88,\nvalidation of our findings employing well-designed scales is needed in further\ninvestigations.\n\nOur study highlights that the dietary patterns of elderly individuals may have\nsignificant associations with their mental health, cognitive functions, blood\nand metabolic biomarkers and brain imaging. A \u2018healthier\u2019 diet with balanced\npreferences in various food categories is associated with better mental health\nstatus, higher levels of cognitive functions and fewer risks of mental\ndisorders. Our findings also indicate that there are genetic associations\nunderlying these dietary patterns, implying that specific genes may be\nsignificant in regulating brain function and promoting mental health. Overall,\nour study provides systematic insights into understanding naturally developed\ndietary patterns in elderly individuals and underscores the associations\nbetween a balanced diet and brain health. The implications of these findings\nhighlight the potential advantages of early-age education on diet, which could\npromote healthy food preferences and cultivate long-term brain health across\nthe lifespan. Future research is needed to fully comprehend the potential\nlong-term associations between these dietary patterns and brain structure and\nhealth, particularly in adolescent and middle-aged populations.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Study population\n\nThis study used data from the UK Biobank under project 19542. The UK Biobank\nstudy was approved by the National Information Governance Board for Health and\nSocial Care and the North West Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee (ref.\nno. 11/NW/0382). All participants provided written informed consent. The risks\nof participants experiencing harm due to their involvement were minimal, and\nthe UK Biobank is equipped with insurance to offer compensation for any\ninstances of negligence resulting in harm during participation. The UK Biobank\nrecruited more than 500,000 people aged 37\u201373 years from the United Kingdom\nbetween 2006 and 2010 (ref. ^89). The data consisted of a wide range of\nphenotypic information and biological samples, including demographic\ncharacteristics, mental health, cognitive function, blood assays, multimodal\nneuroimaging and so on. In this study, we only included participants who\ncompleted the food-liking questionnaire and provided valid responses,\nresulting in a total of 181,990 participants (mean age 70.7 \u00b1 7.7 years and\n57.08% female).\n\n### Food-liking phenotypes\n\nFood-liking data was gathered via an online questionnaire\n(https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/showcase/docs/foodpref.pdf) from\n182,176 participants. The questionnaire comprises 150 items that assessed both\nsensory attributes (for example, bitter and sweet) and food preferences (for\nexample, fruit, vegetables and meat), as well as nonfood items, such as\npreferences for health-related activities (for example, physical activity and\nwatching television). Liking is measured using a 9-point hedonic scale, where\n1 represents \u2018extremely dislike\u2019 and 9 represents \u2018extremely like.\u2019 This\nwidely used scale has good statistical properties, discrimination between\ndifferent points and linearity^90. The UK Biobank provided two response\noptions, \u2018never tried\u2019 or \u2018do not wish to answer,\u2019 in addition to the 9-point\nscale. For our analyses, we included a subset of 140 items related to food and\nbeverages, and classified these items into ten internally reliable categories,\nbased on a classification system of a food preference questionnaire utilized\nin previous research^91, including: alcohol, beverages, dairy, flavorings,\nfruits, fish, meat, snacks, starches and vegetables. The use of these\nclassification criteria serves to underscore our primary research objective,\nwhich is to explore the intricate association between different food\ncategories and brain health. The individual items of each category are listed\nin Supplementary Table 1. We excluded 186 participants (0.1%) who responded\n\u2018never tried\u2019 or \u2018do not wish to answer\u2019 on more than 30% of the 140 food and\nbeverage items, resulting in a final sample of 181,990 participants. Missing\nvalues (that is, \u2018never tried\u2019 or \u2018do not wish to answer\u2019) in the food-liking\ndata were imputed using k-Nearest Neighbors^92 with the \u2018KNNImputer\u2019 function\nof the scikit-learn module in Python. The default settings were used, except\nfor the number of neighboring samples (set as 7). Furthermore, to assess the\nrobustness of our findings in the context of data imputation, we also utilized\nnonimputed data from 72,419 participants for the identification of food-liking\nsubtypes. The demographic characteristics of the 181,990 participants,\nstratified by three age groups, are summarized in Table 1. In addition, we\nconducted a statistical analysis (t-test) to compare demographic\ncharacteristics between individuals who completed the food-liking\nquestionnaire and those who did not within the entire UK Biobank population\n(Supplementary Table 2).\n\nTable 1 Demographic characteristics of the 181,990 UK Biobank participants,\nstratified by age groups\n\nFull size table\n\n### Identification of subtypes based on food-liking phenotypes\n\nTo identify data-driven food-liking subtypes, we first normalized the\nphenotypes using a z-score transformation. Next, to enhance comparability\nacross food categories and reduce the dimensionality of the data^93, we\nperformed a PCA for each food category. Specifically, the number of components\nwas determined by adding the explained variance of each component until the\ntotal explained variance reached at least 80% (ref. ^94). We then used the\nresulting principal components of the ten food categories as input for\nhierarchical clustering^95. The hierarchical clustering used Euclidean\ndistance and inner squared distance (minimum variance algorithm) for computing\nthe distance between clusters. The clustering results were visualized using a\ndendrogram. Based on the dendrogram, we found that the population could be\ngrouped into four distinct food-liking subtypes. To assess the stability of\nthe variance explained by the obtained components and validate the reliability\nof the PCA results, we further examined the explained variance ratios at 70%\nand 90%.\n\nFurthermore, to characterize the food preferences of the four subtypes, we\ncalculated the average liking score for each food category across participants\nof each subtype. Given the variations in the score range across the four\nsubtypes for different food categories, we normalized the liking score of each\nsubtype to a range of 1 to 4 within each food category. To facilitate the\ncomparison of food preferences among subtypes, we further standardized the\nliking score of each food category within each subtype by dividing it by the\nsum of the liking scores of all food categories, yielding a relative liking\nscore for each food category within each subtype.\n\n### Comparisons between food-liking and food-consumption traits\n\nTo examine the relationship between food-liking measures and dietary habits,\nwe adopted an approach that accounts for potentially corresponding\nrelationships between the food frequency questionnaire (category 100052) and\nthe food-liking questionnaire. Specifically, we selected food items that were\ncommon (for example, fruit, beef, lamb and so on) or those that had\ncorresponding and similar items between both questionnaires (for example,\nchicken, cheese, bread and so on). To quantify this relationship, we\ncalculated the average scores for both food-liking and food consumption\nassociated with the selected food traits within each subtype. We visualized\nthis quantitative relationship by generating a stacked bar plot to display\nthese comparable scores of selective food items. This approach enabled us to\ngain a better understanding of the potential associations between food liking\nand food consumption.\n\n### Mental health assessment\n\nThe UK Biobank issued an online mental health self-assessment questionnaire\n(MHQ) in 2016. The questionnaire aimed to comprehensively evaluate self-\nreported symptoms of mental health and associated major environmental factors\n(https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/label.cgi?id=136). Note that the MHQ\nin the UK Biobank is a composite questionnaire, incorporating previously\nexisting and validated measures, which is based, in part, on the World Health\nOrganization\u2019s Composite International Diagnostic Interview\u2014Short Form^96,\nalongside complementary tools that have been widely used in mental health\nresearch and have established validity and reliability^97,98. The World Health\nOrganization\u2019s Composite International Diagnostic Interview\u2014Short Form forms\nthe basis of many other major research studies, including those contributing\nto the work of the international Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. The self-\nreported diagnosed mental disorder rates in the MHQ align with population\nestimates from the Health Survey England^97. For more details regarding the\nrationale and procedure for administration of the MHQ, refer to the UK Biobank\nwebsite (http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/refer.cgi?id=22). In this study,\nwe analyzed eight mental health symptoms, including anxiety symptoms,\ndepressive symptoms, mania symptoms, mental distress, psychotic experience,\nself-harm, trauma and well-being. The quantitative measures of these mental\nhealth symptoms were obtained by calculating an average score of the items\nused to assess each mental health symptom. The sample size of the data\nutilized in this study was from 118,616 participants. Specifically, the scores\nof items in one subcategory of the MHQ were firstly adjusted to the same\ndirection, with higher values indicating more symptoms of mental disorder\n(with the exception of well-being, where a higher value indicated better well-\nbeing). Next, each item was normalized into a range of (0,1) using the MATLAB\nfunction \u2018mapminmax\u2019, and then the items within each category were averaged to\ngenerate an overall measure for each mental health symptom. The items used for\nthe assessment of each mental health symptom were summarized in Supplementary\nTable 4.\n\n### Cognitive assessment\n\nSeveral of the cognitive function tests administered via touchscreen during\nthe initial assessment visit were reimplemented as web-based questionnaires,\nand the participants were invited to complete them remotely\n(https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/label.cgi?id=116). Six cognitive\nfunction tests were analyzed in the current study, including fluid\nintelligence, trail making, symbol\u2013digit substitution, pairs matching,\nreaction time and numeric memory. These tests showed moderate correlations\n(ranging from 0.33 to 0.64, all P < 0.001) with their respective reference\ntest(s) that was judged to be assessing the same cognitive capability or\ndomain, suggesting substantial concurrent validity and test\u2013retest\nreliability^99. For instance, slower response on the reaction time test in the\nUK Biobank was associated with slower responses on Deary\u2013Liewald reaction time\ntest simple reaction time (r = 0.52 and P < 0.001). Additional information on\nthe validity of cognitive tests can be found in Fawns-Ritchie et al.^99.\nAdditionally, the cognitive assessment data utilized in this analysis were\nfrom a substantial sample size of 179,740 participants. Summary information\nand sample size for these cognitive function tests are provided in\nSupplementary Table 5.\n\n### Blood and metabolic biomarkers\n\nBlood biochemistry data (category 17518) was collected from ~480,000\nparticipants during their recruitment visits between 2006 and 2010. The\ndetailed procedures for quality control of blood biochemistry data can be\nfound in Supplementary Information, as well as the open-source document\n(https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/ukb/docs/biomarker_issues.pdf). Blood\ncount data (category 100081) were also collected from the same number of\nparticipants during their first visit, using Beckman Coulter LH750 instruments\nto analyze samples collected in 4 ml EDTA vacutainers. Additional information\nabout the hematology analysis is provided at\n(https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/ukb/docs/haematology.pdf). We\ncategorized the 30 blood biochemistry biomarkers into \u2018liver function\u2019, \u2018renal\nfunction\u2019, \u2018endocrine\u2019, \u2018immunometabolism\u2019 and \u2018bone and joint\u2019, while the 31\nblood cell counts were classified into \u2018white blood cell\u2019, \u2018red blood cell\u2019\nand \u2018platelet\u2019.\n\nThe metabolic biomarkers were measured using a high-throughput nuclear\nmagnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolic biomarker profiling platform from\nrandomly selected EDTA plasma samples collected during the first assessment,\nwhich included ~120,000 participants. Further details on the processing and\nquality control of NMR metabolic biomarkers in the UK Biobank were available\nin Supplementary Information and Julkunen et al.^100. The NMR metabolomics\n(category 220) provided 249 metabolic biomarkers, of which 168 were directly\nmeasured and 81 were ratios of these. For this study, only the 168 directly\nmeasured metabolic biomarkers were used and categorized into \u2018amino acids\u2019,\n\u2018apolipoproteins\u2019, \u2018lipoprotein particle sizes\u2019, \u2018lipoprotein particle\nconcentrations\u2019, \u2018fatty acids\u2019, \u2018triglycerides\u2019, \u2018phospholipids\u2019, \u2018cholesteryl\nesters\u2019, \u2018free cholesterol\u2019, \u2018cholesterol\u2019, \u2018other lipids\u2019, \u2018total lipids\u2019,\n\u2018ketone bodies\u2019, \u2018glycolysis-related metabolites\u2019, \u2018fluid balance\u2019 and\n\u2018inflammation.\u2019 The dataset for blood and metabolic biomarkers utilized in\nthis study was from 42,665 participants. Supplementary Table 6 provides\ndetails of the category and sample size of these blood and metabolic\nbiomarkers.\n\n### Brain MRI traits\n\nThe UK Biobank collected multimodal neuroimaging from ~40,000 participants\nusing a standard Siemens Skyra 3T running VD13A SP4, with a standard Siemens\n32-channel head coil. The details of the image acquisition are provided on the\nUK Biobank website in the form of a protocol\n(http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/refer.cgi?id=2367). The UK Biobank\nconducted all the quality checking and data preprocessing procedures. The\ndetails of the acquisition protocols, image processing pipeline, image data\nfiles and imaging-derived phenotypes of brain structure and function are\navailable on the UK Biobank website\n(http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/refer.cgi?id=1977) and elsewhere^89,101.\nWe briefly describe the quality control steps for structural and diffusion MRI\nin Supplementary Information.\n\n### Structural MRI\n\nThis study utilized quality-controlled T1-weighted neuroimaging data obtained\nfrom structural MRI to investigate GMV in 32,715 participants. The T1 data\nwere preprocessed with the Statistical Parametric Mapping software version 12\n(https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) using the CAT12 toolbox (https://neuro-\njena.github.io/cat/) with default settings. The preprocessing involved high-\ndimensional spatial normalization with an integrated Dartel template in the\nMontreal Neurological Institute space, followed by nonlinear modulations and\ncorrection for the head size of each individual. Following these procedures,\ngray matter images (voxel size 1.5 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 1.5 mm^3) were obtained for all\nparticipants. The AAL2 atlas with 94 cortical brain regions^102 was used to\nextract imaging-derived phenotypes referred to as atlas regional GMV.\nIntracranial volume was included as a covariate in the statistical analyses of\nGMV.\n\n### Diffusion MRI\n\nThe diffusion MRI data in the UK Biobank was obtained with two b-values (b =\n1,000 and 2,000 s mm^\u2212^2) at a spatial resolution of 2 mm using a multiband\nacceleration factor of three, which allows for the acquisition of three slices\nsimultaneously. For each diffusion-weighted shell, 50 distinct diffusion-\nencoding directions are obtained, resulting in a total of 100 directions\nacross the two b-values. A standard (monopolar) Stejskal\u2013Tanner pulse sequence\nis used for diffusion preparation, enabling a shorter echo time (TE of 92 ms)\nand higher signal-to-noise ratio compared with a twice-refocused (bipolar)\nsequence, although stronger eddy current distortions are introduced. The Eddy\ntool was used to correct for static field distortion, motion and eddy current\ndistortions^103,104. The diffusion MRI data were corrected for distortions,\neddy currents and head motion and then modeled using FMRIB\u2019s Diffusion Toolbox\nfor diffusion modeling and tractography analysis^105,106. The neurite\norientation dispersion and density imaging modeling were conducted using\naccelerated microstructure imaging via the Convex Optimization tool^107. White\nmatter pathways are aligned cross-subject for extracting image-derived\nphenotypes using tract-based spatial statistics^108,109, in which a high-\ndimensional warp maps a standard-space white matter skeleton to each\nparticipant, followed by defining ROIs as the intersection of the skeleton\nwith standard-space masks for 48 tracts^110. Definitions of tract regions and\nnames can be found in the JHU ICBM-DTI-81 white-matter labels atlas described\nat http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/Atlases. The diffusion tensor imaging\nmeasures included FA, which reflects the directionality of diffusion, and MD,\nwhich measures overall diffusivity^111. Statistical analyses were performed on\nthe mean FA and MD of white matter tracts within the JHU ICBM-DTI-81 white-\nmatter labels atlas (category 134) from 31,195 participants.\n\n### PRSs for mental disorders\n\nThe UK Biobank has released optimized PRSs for 28 diseases and 25 quantitative\ntraits. The PRS scores were generated using a Bayesian approach applied to\nmeta-analyzed summary statistics GWAS data. A principal component-based\nancestry centering step was applied to center the score distributions around\nzero across all ancestries, and the score distributions were also standardized\nto have approximately unit variance within ancestry groups. More details about\nthe initial PRS release are available at\nhttps://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/refer.cgi?id=5202. For the current\nanalyses, we used the standard PRS of several mental disorders, including\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease, bipolar disorder, Parkinson\u2019s disease and schizophrenia,\nas well as ischemic stroke and cardiovascular disease. The standard PRS set\nwas calculated for all UK Biobank individuals, and the data were obtained\nentirely from external GWAS data. The dataset of PRSs used in this study was\nfrom 176,465 participants. The predictive performance of PRS for these six\ndiseases is shown in Thompson et al.^112.\n\nAdditionally, we computed PRSs for depression and suicide attempt based on\nexisting GWAS summary statistics^113,114. To accomplish this, we utilized\nPRSice-2, in which details can be found at http://www.prsice.info, to estimate\nthe PRS for each participant, after clumping the SNPs with an r^2 threshold of\n0.1 and a physical distance of 250 kb, resulting in only the most strongly\nassociated SNP being retained. The PRSs for each mental disorder were then\ncalculated using a threshold of 0.05. The data for the PRSs of depression and\nsuicide used in this study were both from 126,895 participants.\n\n### Statistical analyses\n\n#### One-way ANCOVA and post hoc tests\n\nTo compare measures of interest among the four subtypes, we conducted one-way\nANCOVA analyses^115 on mental health symptoms, cognitive functions, blood\ncount and NMR metabolic biomarkers, brain MRI traits and PRSs of mental\ndisorders. A Levene\u2019s test^116 was conducted to assess the equality of\nvariances before one-way ANCOVAs. Additionally, post hoc tests^117 using two\nsample t-tests were performed to examine the differences between subtypes 1,\n2, or 3 and subtype 4. To ensure the accuracy of our results, we included\nstandard covariates of no interest, such as sex, age, BMI, education\nqualifications, Townsend deprivation index^118 and scanning sites (the last\nonly applied to brain MRI traits). Additional covariates were also included to\naccount for potential confounding factors, including the intracranial volume\n(regressed out in the analyses of GMV) and the PRS genetic principal\ncomponents (regressed out in the analyses of PRSs of mental disorders). To\ncorrect for multiple comparisons, we used Bonferroni corrections in the\nanalyses of mental health symptoms, cognitive functions, blood count and NMR\nmetabolic biomarkers and PRSs of mental disorders. For the analyses of brain\nMRI traits, we used FDR corrections to correct for multiple comparisons.\n\n#### Cox proportional hazards models\n\nTo assess the differences in survival rates of several common mental disorders\namong the four subtypes, Cox proportional hazards models were employed in this\nstudy, with subtype 4 serving as the reference group. The Cox model relies on\nthe fundamental assumption of proportional hazards, which posits that the\nrelative hazard remains constant over time across various levels of\ncovariates^119. To ensure this assumption, we employed the Schoenfeld\nresiduals method^119, which tested the nonzero slope of each time-dependent\ncovariate in the Cox model. The analyses were adjusted for sex, age, BMI,\neducation qualifications and Townsend index^118. The analyses included 11\nmental disorders, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease (International Classification\nof Diseases (ICD)-10 F00 and G30), anxiety (ICD-10 F40 and F41), bipolar\ndisorder (ICD-10 F31), depression (ICD-10 F32 and F33), dementia (ICD-10 F00,\nF01, F02, F03 and G30), eating disorder (ICD-10 F50), Parkinson\u2019s disease\n(ICD-10 G20), stroke (ICD-10 G45, G46, I60, I61, I63 and I64), sleep disorder\n(ICD-10 G47), migraine (ICD-10 G43) and schizophrenia (ICD-10 F20). The\nduration of follow-up, defined as the time elapsed from the participants\u2019\nfirst occurrence of a mental disorder until their death, loss of follow-up or\n19 July 2022 (whichever came first), was used as the timescale. The data were\nprovided by 180,173 participants from the UK Biobank. The results of the\nmodels were presented as HRs and 95% CI, representing the averaged ratio of\nhazard of mental disorders between the other three subtypes compared with\nsubtype 4 within 15 years of follow-up. The FDR corrections were used for\nmultiple comparisons. Multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed\nusing the \u2018survival\u2019 package in R^120.\n\n#### SEM\n\nA SEM^121 was employed to investigate the associations between food-liking and\nthree latent variables: mental health, cognitive function, and brain MRI\ntrait. We constructed three separate SEMs for each of the food-liking\ncomparisons between the subtypes (subtypes 1, 2 or 3) and subtype 4. Food-\nliking was treated as a group variable indicating the other subtypes or\nsubtype 4. The three latent variables were created by combining measurements\nthat exhibited significant differences between other subtypes and subtype 4 in\npost hoc tests. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to estimate the latent\nvariables in the model. The cognitive function latent variable was assessed on\nthe basis of symbol\u2013digit substitution, fluid intelligence, pair matching and\nreaction time. The mental health latent variable was evaluated using anxiety\nsymptoms, depressive symptoms, mental distress, psychotic experiences, self-\nharm, trauma and well-being scores, which were obtained from the MHQ. The\nbrain MRI trait latent variables in the three SEMs were constructed from the\nGMV of specific brain regions, the mean FA of the white matter tracts and the\nMD of the white matter tracts that showed significant differences between\nother subtypes and subtype 4. The RMSEA was used to assess model fitness. The\nanalyses were conducted using the \u2018lavaan 0.6\u201314\u2019 package in R.\n\n#### Case\u2013control GWAS\n\nGenotype data were obtained for all 500,000 participants from the UK Biobank\nv3 imputation. The comprehensive genotyping and quality-control procedures\nfrom the UK Biobank are described in a previous publication^122. We performed\nquality control for the genotype data from ~500,000 participants extracted\nfrom UKB v3 imputation, excluding SNPs with call rate <95%, minor allele\nfrequency <0.1% and deviation from Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium (P < 1\u00d710^\u221210).\nWe included only participants who were estimated to have recent British\nancestry and no more than ten putative third-degree relatives in the analyses.\nAfter quality control, a total of 337,199 participants with 8,894,431 SNPs\nwere included in our analysis. In this study, we utilized the genetic data\nfrom 181,551 participants.\n\nTo explore the genetic underpinnings of distinct subtypes of food-liking, we\nperformed GWAS using logistic regression in PLINK 2.0 (refs. ^123)\n(https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/2.0/) on a binary phenotype distinguishing\nbetween other subtypes (subtype 1, n = 32,843; subtype 2, n = 10,056; and\nsubtype 3, n = 35,178) and subtype 4 (controls, n = 103,474), while adjusting\nfor sex, age, BMI, the top ten ancestry principal components and genotype\nmeasurement batch.\n\n#### Gene expression and enrichment analysis\n\nTo provide further biological insights into the GWAS results, we utilized gene\nset enrichment analysis via FUMA^124. First, we employed the SNP2GENE function\nin FUMA to map the SNPs with significant differences (P < 5 \u00d7 10^\u22128) between\nsubtype 3 and subtype 4 in the GWAS results to a set of prioritized genes\nbased on positional, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and chromatin\ninteraction information of the SNPs. FUMA identifies independent, significant\nSNPs and their surrounding genomic loci based on LD structure and defines lead\nSNPs and genomic risk loci from the provided summary statistics. Next, we used\nthe GENE2FUNC function to obtain information on gene expression and test for\nenrichment of the mapped genes from SNP2GENE in predefined pathways. The gene\nexpression analysis was based on the GTEx (v8 54 tissue types) dataset^125 and\nprovided averaged expression values (log_2 transformed) per gene per label\n(for example, tissue types or developmental stage). For enrichment analysis on\nthe mapped genes, hypergeometric tests were performed to determine if the\nmapped genes were overrepresented in any of the predefined gene sets. The FUMA\nplatform provides access to three prominent gene sets for conducting\nenrichment analyses, namely the Molecular Signatures Database^126,\nWikiPathways^127 and the GWAS catalog^128. A multiple test correction was\nconducted using the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg FDR with an adjusted P value cutoff of\n0.05 and a minimum of two overlapped genes.\n\n### Inclusion and ethics statement\n\nThis work involved a collaboration between scientists in China and the United\nKingdom.
