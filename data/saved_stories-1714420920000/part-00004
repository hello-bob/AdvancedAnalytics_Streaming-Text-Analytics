Conclusion\n\nThe Google Search URL parameters are important to understand whether you are\nmaximizing the conversion rate in your ad groups and optimizing your cost per\nclick(CPC) rates in Google Analytics for your ad campaigns, improving your\nSEO(Search Engine Optimization) metrics for your e-commerce business, or\ncollecting data for your social media project. Using custom parameters for\nyour search will affect the Search Engine Result Page (SERP) data\nsignificantly in your favor. SerpApi unlocks the power of SERP data to you\nwith minimal effort, the fastest response times, and in the most complete\nform.\n\nRegister to claim free credits\n\nIn this blog post, we will explore some of the Google search parameters with\ntheir corresponding attributions in SerpApi Documentation. You can head to\nSerpApi Playground to test all of the information you will read below.\n\n### What are Google Search parameters?\n\nGoogle Search parameters are like special codes you can add to the web address\n(URL) when you search on Google. They help you control and customize your\nsearch results. For example, you can use them to specify the language or\nlocation for your search.\n\nHere's how they work: When you type a search query into Google, it creates a\nURL with your search terms. You can then add parameters to this URL using an\nampersand (&) followed by the parameter name and value. These parameters,\noften called \"params\" for short, tell Google how you want your search results\nto be customized.\n\nFor instance, if you want to search for \"cats\" in Spanish, you could add\n\"hl=es\" to the end of the URL. This tells Google to show results in Spanish.\nOnce you've added all the parameters you want, you have your final URL ready\nfor tailoring your tracking template. When you open this URL in your web\nbrowser, Google will show you search results based on the parameters you've\nspecified.\n\n## The q parameter\n\nIt represents the search query submitted to Google. For example, in\n\"q=Coffee\", \"Cofee\" is the query you're searching for. It can also be used\nwith special commands for filtering specific file types, filtering keywords in\nURLs and bodies, etc. giving you more exact matches. Some of these advanced\nsearch operators include filetype, inurl, intitle, intext, inanchor, allinurl,\nallinanchor, allintitle, allintext. You can check out Ultimate Guide to Google\nSearch Operators for detailed, and up-to-date information on how to use Google\nsearch operators.\n\nReference in SerpApi Documentation\n\nThe \u2018oq\u2018 parameter of Google represents the query typed into the Google search\nbox.\n\n## The hl parameter\n\nIt stands for a host language, it determines the language used for the search.\nThere are different versions of the \u2018hl\u2018 parameters you can pass to a Google\nSearch. The two-letter version is for all languages supported by Google. For\nexample \"hl=en\" searches in the English language. There are also two letters\nfollowed by a hyphen and two letters or three-digit versions representing\ndialects. Examples of this kind are \"hl=en-gb\" representing British English,\nor \"hl=es-419\" representing Latin American Spanish.\n\nReference in SerpApi Documentation\n\n## The gl parameter\n\nIt represents geolocation, which can be used to personalize search results\nbased on the region. It is a two-letter country code. For example \"gl=us\" will\nserve results for the United States.\n\nReference in SerpApi Documentation\n\n## The lr parameter\n\nIt stands for language restriction, it's used to limit your search results to\nwebpages in a specific language or languages. It is a two-letter language code\nproceeded by the word lang and an underscore. Multiple languages can be passed\nusing a bar symbol. For example \"lr=lang_en|lang_fr\" will restrict the results\nto websites with only English and French languages.\n\nReference in SerpApi Documentation\n\n## The cr parameter\n\nIt represents country restriction, it refines results based on preferred\nregion. It is a two-letter uppercase country code proceeded by the word\ncountry. Multiple countries can be passed using a bar symbol. For example\n\"cr=countryUS|countryFR\" will restrict the results pages to the United States\nand France.\n\nReference in SerpApi Documentation\n\n## The tbs parameter\n\nIt stands for to be searched, it can be used for various purposes, for\nexample, to filter results by a specific date or a date range (e.g., past\nweek, past month). For example, \"tbs=qdr:h\" will serve only the results from\nthe last hour.\n\nReference in SerpApi Documentation\n\n## The source parameter\n\nIt indicates the source of your search, such as the Google homepage or a\nreferral from another website. For example \"source=hp\" means that the page was\naccessed through the homepage.\n\n## The ei parameter\n\nIt possibly stands for engine identifier, a unique identifier assigned to each\nsearch, likely used for internal tracking by Google. Its decoded form consists\nof four numbers. The first two are a Unix timestamp and microseconds of that\ntimestamp respectively. The last two are undisclosed and unknown.\n\n## The ved parameter\n\nIt is used for internal tracking of links and elements. Apart from the link\nitself, the element index and type can be gathered by decoding the ved value.\n\nOpen Source Repository for Decoding the ved values\n\n## The gs_lp parameter\n\nNot much is disclosed about this parameter. It contains the search query and\nsearch client.\n\n## The iflsig parameter\n\nThis parameter isn't disclosed. It is speculated to be about internal\nredirects. Other assumptions include relations to parsing.\n\n## The ibp parameter\n\nIt is responsible for rendering elements differently than their usual format.\nFor example, when used with the ludocid parameter (unique id for a Google\nBusiness listing) in a mobile view, \"ibp=gwp;0,7&ludocid=1663467585083384531\",\nthe 'ibp' parameter can give full page views of the listing.\n\nReference in SerpApi Documentation\n\n## The kgmid parameter\n\nThe parameter is responsible for serving elements saved by Google including\nknowledge graph. It can override the \u2018q\u2018 (query) parameter. For example\n\"kgmid=/m/07gyp7\" will get results for McDonald's with a knowledge graph\nregardless of the query parameter. The parameter is likely acting as a cached\nversion of the Google advanced search parameters.\n\nReference in SerpApi Documentation\n\n## The si parameter\n\nIt is used to serve knowledge graph tabs alongside other tasks. For example,\nin the example below, the 'si' parameter is responsible for serving the Google\nsearch results with the 'Music Groups' tab of the knowledge graph for Jimi\nHendrix.\n\nReference in SerpApi Documentation\n\n## The sxsrf parameter\n\nIt is possibly an internal token for security. The 'sxsrf' consists of an\nencoded token probably for security purposes, and a unix timestamp.\n\n## The uule parameter\n\nIt is used to specify a location for a search. The 'uule' parameter has two\ntypes. The first type is an encoded form of the canonical name of a place in\nGoogle Ads API Geo Targets. The second type is an encoded form of the GPS\ncoordinates alongside other data.\n\nReference in SerpApi Documentation\n\nA Blog Post about Different Types of UULE\n\n## The sclient parameter\n\nIt stands for search client. For example \"sclient=gws-wiz\" means Google Web\nSearch Wizard is used for the search.\n\n## The tbm parameter\n\nIt stands for to be matched. This parameter specifies the type of content that\nthe user is searching for, allowing Google to tailor the search results\naccordingly. For instance, \"tbm=isch\" indicates that the search is intended\nfor image search, while \"tbm=nws\" directs Google to prioritize results from\nGoogle News. By utilizing this parameter, users can fine-tune their searches\nto precisely start finding pages, sites, or specific content types using\nGoogle's sophisticated algorithm. Additionally, users can specify whether they\nwant to search within meta information, anchor text, or other elements through\nthe appropriate parameters. This level of customization empowers users to\nefficiently navigate the vast expanse of information accessible through\nGoogle's search bar.\n\nReference in SerpApi Documentation\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI would like to thank the reader for their attention.
