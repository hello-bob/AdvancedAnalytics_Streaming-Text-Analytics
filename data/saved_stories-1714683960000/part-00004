Yet over the years, numerous bacteria have made it onto\nthe ISS. They are not only thriving, they are mutating into something never\nbefore seen on Earth.\n\nThe new strains are both genetically and functionally different from their\noriginal terrestrial selves. The odd conditions of space have somehow made\nthem more resistant to antibiotics and other treatment. The microgravity,\nsolar radiation, and high carbon dioxide levels that the bacteria experience\nin low orbit have forced them to evolve into a kind of super-bacteria.\n\n## Potentially harmful\n\nThe new study focuses on Enterobacter bugandensis. Here on Earth, it is linked\nto neonatal blood infections that cause sepsis, endocarditis, and urinary,\nskin, and soft tissue infections. Luckily, it tends only to affect the immuno-\ncompromised. On Earth, it is already notoriously resistant to treatment. But\nnothing like it is in space.\n\nIn 2018, researchers began looking at the microorganisms aboard the ISS. They\ndiscovered several fungi and bacteria. Clearly, all of them hitchhiked there\nvia the almost 300 visiting astronauts. In that initial study, five strains of\nE. Bugandensis had made it into space. Now there are 13, according to new\nresearch. Four live in the ISS air system, one on an exercise machine, and\nperhaps not surprisingly, eight in the bathroom.\n\nResearchers have analyzed all the strains. They studied the bacteria\u2019s genome\nand looked for differences between the bacteria on Earth and how it presents\non the ISS.\n\n\u201cThe ISS genomes exhibited an average of 4,568 genes, a significantly higher\ncount than the average of 4,416 genes found in the Earth genomes,\u201d the study\npointed out. \u201cWe identified certain genes that are exclusively present in\norganisms associated with the ISS, but not in their terrestrial counterpart.\u201d\n\n## More care needed\n\nThey also studied how a particular bacterium interacts with other bacteria on\nthe ISS and how well it\u2019s flourishing. All the bacteria are thriving and\nbenefiting other microorganisms, helping them, in turn, to flourish in space.\nThe stress of space has made E. bugandensis so resistant it could become a\ndominant microorganism on the ISS.\n\nResearchers are unsure if the souped-up pathogen will affect the health of\nastronauts. Whether it remains potentially harmful at all is a mystery. Still,\nNASA plans to develop more stringent measures for the ISS and future space\nmissions. The rigors of space already impact the health of astronauts and\ntheir immune systems. It is crucial that harmful microbes don\u2019t flourish too\nwell on space vessels.\n\n+1\n\n#### Rebecca McPhee\n\nRebecca McPhee is a freelance writer for ExplorersWeb.\n\nRebecca has been writing about open water sports, adventure travel, and marine\nscience for three years.
