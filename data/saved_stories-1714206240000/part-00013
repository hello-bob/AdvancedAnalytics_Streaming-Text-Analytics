Two\nministers defended their decision to a parliamentary committee.\n\nhttps://p.dw.com/p/4fE90\n\nCopy link\n\nGermany's last three nuclear power plants were switched off in April last\nyearImage: Ina Fassbender/AFP\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo German ministers on Friday defended their handling of the extension of\nGermany's three remaining nuclear power stations during the 2022-23 energy\ncrisis, after a media report alleged the process was bungled.\n\nCicero magazine reported a day earlier that officials from the environmentally\nfriendly Green Party had acted in a \"deceptive\" manner by ignoring expert\nadvice and seeking to proceed with the phase-out of nuclear energy, which had\nbeen planned since 2011.\n\nThe government was keen to shore up energy supplies after Russia's full-scale\ninvasion of Ukraine, which saw Germany ween itself of Russian natural gas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Report alleges experts were ignored\n\nFollowing a court ruling, the weekly magazine obtained documents from the\nEconomy Ministry related to plans to extend the life of Germany's last nuclear\npower stations. The documents contained emails, memos, meeting minutes and\nletters.\n\nThe magazine alleged that top officials in the Green Party were keen to avoid\nextending the life of the nuclear power plants due to their decadeslong policy\ncommitment to phasing out nuclear power.\n\nCicero alleged that experts paid by the ministries, who had argued that the\nnuclear facilities were still safe to operate, were ignored and that sometimes\ntheir assessments were deliberately falsified.\n\nThe magazine also accused Economy Minister Robert Habeck of misleading the\npublic during a TV interview in February 2022 when he denied that extending\nthe life of the nuclear facilities would help Germany's energy needs during\nthe winter.\n\nHabeck's viewpoint conflicted with advice from experts who said that nuclear\npower could help save the use of gas and avoid a power crisis, just as Germany\nwas trying to cut its dependence on Russian energy.\n\nSeveral months later, the government agreed to extend the life of the last\nthree nuclear plants by several months.\n\nGermany's last three nuclear power plants \u2014 Isar 2 in Bavaria, Emsland in\nLower Saxony, and Neckarwestheim 2 in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg \u2014 were finally\nswitched off in April last year.\n\n## Is shutting down nuclear energy a mistake?\n\n07:05\n\n## How did the ministers defend themselves?\n\nAfter addressing the Bundestag's energy committee, Habeck said his department\nhad examined the possible extension of the nuclear plants at a very early\nstage.\n\nHe said the operators had initially said the existing fuel elements could only\nbe used until the end of the current year.\n\nHabeck referred to a letter from the energy firm Eon in February 2022, which\nmentioned that the fuel elements would have likely burned out by the end of\n2022.\n\nThe operators later said the elements could be used up to five months longer,\nbefore extending their estimate further, he added.\n\nAt the time, Habeck's Economy Ministry had argued that Germany needed a\nreplacement for Russian national gas, mostly used for heating, rather than\nelectricity, which the nuclear plants provided.\n\nEnvironment Minister Steffi Lemke, meanwhile, insisted that her department had\npresented all events in a \"transparent and comprehensible\" manner.\n\nThe Green Party lawmaker emphasized that the assessments were \"oriented at all\ntimes towards the nuclear safety of our country.\"\n\nHabeck's Greens had long called for the phase out of nuclear power Image: Ina\nFassbender/AFP\n\n## Germany's conservative opposition cries foul\n\nThe conservative faction in the Bundestag has called for further hearings from\nHabeck and Lemke over the reports.\n\n\"There is still a reasonable assumption that Habeck's ministry did the\nopposite of what he had publicly announced. Distortion of facts instead of\nopen-ended examination,\" Andreas Jung, the center-right CDU's spokesman for\nclimate protection and energy, told Germany's dpa news agency.\n\n\"Suspicion is getting stronger that the decision to phase out nuclear power\nwas not done openly, but was determined from the outset. That people were\ntricked and deceived.\" Andreas Lenz, the political spokesman for the CSU \u2014 the\nCDU's Bavarian sister party \u2014 on energy and sustainability, said.\n\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in\nGerman politics and society.
