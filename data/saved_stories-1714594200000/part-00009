South Korea's Ministry of Justice, for example, also publishes\nthe names of people losing South Korean nationality in the government\ngazette.^[1] Prior to the 1990s, however, loss of United States citizenship\nwas not a matter of public record; the State Department considered that\nroutine disclosure of the names of people giving up U.S. citizenship might\nviolate the Privacy Act of 1974 and other laws.^[2]^[3]\n\nThe United States government first released a list of former U.S. citizens in\na State Department letter to Congress made public by a 1995 Joint Committee on\nTaxation report.^[4] That report contained the names of 978 people who had\nrelinquished U.S. citizenship between January 1, 1994 and April 25, 1995.^[5]\nThis action was in the larger context of widespread media attention to the\nissue of wealthy individuals who gave up citizenship to avoid United States\ntaxes. As a result, several legislators proposed bills or amendments to end\nthe confidentiality surrounding loss of citizenship, and to publish the names\nof ex-citizens.^[6] The one that eventually passed was an amendment by Sam\nGibbons (D-FL) to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of\n1996.^[7] That amendment added new provisions to the Internal Revenue Code\n(now at 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6039G) to require that the Treasury Department publish the\nnames of persons relinquishing U.S. citizenship within thirty days after the\nend of each calendar quarter. Publication began in 1996; lists published in\n1997 included the names of people losing citizenship after 1995.^[8] The list\nincludes only the names of former citizens, not their reasons for giving up\ncitizenship or other information about them.^[9] Lawyers familiar with the\nprocess state that it takes roughly six months after people give up\ncitizenship for their names to appear in the list.^[10]\n\nCongress' motive for requiring this publication was to \"shame or embarrass\"\npeople who give up U.S. citizenship for tax reasons.^[11] However, Michael S.\nKirsch of Notre Dame Law School questions the effectiveness of this, given\nthat it may result in the shaming of people who give up U.S. citizenship for\nother reasons, while having little effect on or even acting as a badge of\nhonor for wealthy individuals who are \"particularly individualistic and\nunconcerned with how they may be perceived by the general population.\"^[11]\nGibbons expected that the list would include only \"a handful of the wealthiest\nof the wealthy\" motivated solely by taxes; however, the people named in the\nlist turned out to have a wide variety of motivations for emigrating from the\nU.S. and later giving up citizenship, and few were publicly known to be\nwealthy.^[7] As a Wall Street Journal article described the political\nenvironment of the mid-1990s which led to the creation of the list: \"Congress\ngot mad at legal aliens who use social services but don't become U.S.\ncitizens. Less noisily, it got mad at Americans who become legal aliens in\nother countries, use services there, but decide not to remain U.S. citizens\nfor life.\"^[7]\n\n## Criteria for inclusion in list[edit]\n\nComparisons with other sources of data on ex-citizens suggest that the lists\nof ex-citizens published in the Federal Register may not necessarily include\nall ex-citizens.^[12] Media reports from authors who believe that the IRS list\nis supposed to include all expatriates have suggested this means the Federal\nRegister expatriate list has been \"lowballing its numbers.\"^[12]^[13] Other\nsources advance a variety of explanations.\n\n### Non-covered expatriates[edit]\n\nThere are differences of opinion among lawyers over whether 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6039G\nmandates that the names of only some or all former citizens must appear in the\nQuarterly Publication. One opinion is that only those who are subject to the\nexpatriation tax (so-called \"covered expatriates\") appear in the list. (Under\ncurrent law, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 877(a)(2), \"covered expatriates\" are those with more\nthan $2,000,000 in assets, an average of $124,000\u2014adjusted for inflation\u2014in\ntaxes owed or paid over the preceding five years, or who are unable to certify\nunder penalty of perjury that they have complied with all tax form filing and\npayment obligations in the preceding five years.) Those with this opinion\ninclude David Lesperance and John Gaver.^[14] In contrast, Andrew Mitchel, a\nConnecticut tax lawyer interviewed by The Wall Street Journal for its reports\non Americans giving up citizenship, states that the list is required to\ninclude all former citizens.^[15] Michael Kirsch also states that the list is\nrequired to include all former citizens, not just those deemed by Section 877\nto be giving up citizenship for tax reasons.^[16]\n\nUnder 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 877 (the old expatriation tax statute) as in effect from the\n1996 passage of HIPAA until the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004,\nexpatriation tax was imposed only if the IRS determined that \"one of the\nprincipal purposes\" of a U.S. person's abandonment of citizenship or permanent\nresidence status was avoidance of taxation. Nevertheless, according to a 2000\nCongressional Research Service memorandum, the IRS did not at that time make\nthe determination of principal purposes before including a person's name in\nthe Quarterly Publication, and so stated that \"these lists include expatriates\nwhose motivation may not have been tax avoidance\".^[17]\n\nRobert Wood of Wood LLP in San Francisco, writing in Forbes, states that the\nQuarterly Publication does not include \"[w]hat is often called consular\nexpatriations, where people don\u2019t file exit tax forms with the IRS\".^[18] The\nAmerican Bar Association's Taxation Section believes 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6039G should\nbe read not to require persons whose loss of citizenship occurred before the\npassage of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 to file the exit tax form\n(Form 8854), and has urged the issuance of Treasury regulations clarifying\nthis interpretation.^[19]\n\n### Non-citizen former permanent residents[edit]\n\nThe Quarterly Publication may be required to include the names not just of\nformer U.S. citizens but of certain former permanent residents (\"ex-green card\nholders\") as well. Under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6039G(d)(3), \"the Federal agency\nprimarily responsible for administering the immigration laws shall provide to\nthe Secretary the name of each lawful permanent resident of the United States\n(within the meaning of section 7701 (b)(6)) whose status as such has been\nrevoked or has been administratively or judicially determined to have been\nabandoned.\" The Quarterly Publication includes a statement that \"for purposes\nof this listing, long-term residents, as defined in section 877(e)(2), are\ntreated as if they were citizens of the United States who lost\ncitizenship\".^[20] Andrew Mitchel, a Connecticut tax lawyer, believes that the\nlaw requires the IRS to include former long-term green card holders in the\nQuarterly Publication, but given the number of names which appear, he finds it\nunlikely that they are actually included.^[21]\n\nIn 2000, a Government Accountability Office report noted that while the\nImmigration and Naturalization Service provided data to the IRS in electronic\nform identifying individuals who gave up permanent residence status, the data\ndid not fulfill the IRS' needs because it did not generally include Taxpayer\nIdentification Numbers nor contain information on the length of time for which\neach of the former permanent residents had held his or her status, and thus\nthe IRS could not use the information for tracking people who were subject to\nthe expatriation tax.^[22] The tax law definition of abandonment of lawful\npermanent residence does not include people whose green cards expire; they\ncontinue to be subject to federal tax as U.S. residents rather than the\nexpatriation tax, and are not regarded by the IRS as having \"expatriated\" even\nthough they may no longer possess the right to reside in the United States.\nAccording to 26 CFR 301.7701(b)-1, the only way for an individual to initiate\nthe process of administrative determination of abandonment of lawful residence\nis to file Form I-407. Additionally, a green card holder who takes a tax\ntreaty-based return position as a non-resident of the U.S. also triggers the\nexpatriation tax.^[20]\n\n### Reinsurance companies[edit]\n\nThree reinsurance companies have been included in the Quarterly Publication:\nRBC Reinsurance, Ltd. in Q2 2000; ING Re Limited (Ireland) in Q1 2003; and\nImagine International Reinsurance Limited in Q2 2003. International tax\npractitioners were uncertain why companies would appear in the Quarterly\nPublication, as the expatriation tax provisions and the provisions of 26\nU.S.C. \u00a7 6039G(d) establishing the list itself all refer to \"individual[s]\"\nlosing United States citizenship; although the term \"individual\" is not\ndefined in the Internal Revenue Code, it is unlikely that it could be\ninterpreted to include entities (unlike the term \"person\", which 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\n7701(a)(1) explicitly defines to include legal persons). Furthermore, Section\n6039G makes no allowance for publication of the names of entities that engage\nin tax inversions (which are sometimes mistakenly referred to in the popular\npress as \"corporations renouncing their citizenship\").^[23]\n\n## Comparison with other sources of data on ex-citizens[edit]\n\nSince 1998, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has also maintained its own\nlist of people who have renounced citizenship under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1481(a)(5), as\nthis is one of the categories of people prohibited from purchasing firearms\nunder the Gun Control Act of 1968 and who must be entered into the National\nInstant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) under the Brady Handgun\nViolence Prevention Act of 1993.^[24]^[25] The names are not made public, but\neach month the FBI issues a report on the number of entries added in each\ncategory. NICS covers a different population from the Federal Register\nexpatriate list: the former includes only those who renounce U.S. citizenship,\nwhile the latter should include those who voluntarily lose citizenship by any\nmeans, and possibly certain former permanent residents as well.^[12]^[26]\n\nIn 2012, the FBI added 4,652 records to the NICS \"renounced U.S. citizenship\"\ncategory in 2012, much larger than the number of names published in the\nFederal Register expatriate lists during the same period.^[12] About 2,900 of\nthose were added to NICS in one large batch in October 2012; FBI spokesman\nStephen G. Fischer attributed this jump to State Department efforts to clear a\nbacklog of earlier renunciants who had not been provided to the FBI\npreviously.^[27] However, in 2013, the number of records of renunciants added\nto NICS again exceeded the number of names published in the Federal Register\nexpatriate list, with 3,128 renunciants in the former against only 3,000\nlosing citizenship or permanent residence by any means in the latter.^[26]\n\nUnited States Citizenship and Immigration Services stated, in response to a\n2013 Freedom of Information Act request, that an average of 18,196 people per\nyear filed Form I-407 to abandon their LPR status in each of Fiscal Years 2010\nthrough 2012.^[20] In 2014 Paperwork Reduction Act filings, USCIS estimated\nthat annually, 9,371 people would file Form I-407 in the following three\nyears.^[28] The State Department estimated in 2007 that annually, 2,298 people\nfile Form DS-4079 to relinquish their United States citizenship.^[29] Finally,\nthe IRS estimated in 2012 that Notices 97-19 and 98-34, which \"provide\nguidance regarding the federal tax consequences for certain individuals who\nlose U.S. citizenship\" or \"cease to be taxed as U.S. lawful permanent\nresidents\", apply to 12,350 people annually.^[30]\n\nThe State Department stated that 1,100 people renounced citizenship at only\none particular US consulate post during the first ten months of 2014.^[31]\nThere are more than 270 US consular posts.^[32] In September 2015, the State\nDepartment estimated that there would be 5,986 renunciants and 559\nrelinquishers during Fiscal Year 2015.^[33]\n\n## Statistics[edit]\n\nCount of names in the Quarterly Publication of Individuals Who Have Chosen to\nExpatriate5001,0001,5002,0002,5003,0001997199819992000200120022003200420052006200720082009201020112012201320142015201620172018201920202021202220232024  \n---  \nNumber of persons whose names were published after the IRS received\ninformation on their loss of citizenship during the quarter in question| Data\nfor 1997 are not directly comparable to other years because lists published\nthat year also included the names of people who lost citizenship in 1995 and\n1996^[8]  \n  \n\"Count of names\" refers to the number of entries contained in that quarter's\nlist.
