For the EcoCar EV challenge, their job is to improve\non the Cadillac Lyriq.\n\nEcoCar\n\n#### reader comments\n\n53\n\nAcross the country, teams of students at 15 different universities are in the\nmiddle of a four-year project, dissecting an electric vehicle and figuring out\nways to make it even better. The program, called the EcoCar EV Challenge, was\nfounded more than three decades ago by the US Department of Energy and is run\nby the DOE's Argonne National Laboratory.\n\nOver the last 35 years, more than 30,000 students from 95 universities have\nparticipated in the EcoCar Challenge, part of the DOE's Advanced Vehicle\nTechnology Competition. Each segment spans four years, with the most recent\ncycle beginning in 2023 with a new Cadillac Lyriq donated by the General\nMotors automaker.\n\nThe students take this competition very seriously, as participation alone\nbrings a lot of benefits, including the potential for a lifelong career path.\n\n## Mobility advancement in progress\n\nOne of the organization's goals is to challenge teams to \"identify and address\nspecific challenges with equity in the future of mobility through the\napplication of innovative hardware and software solutions\" while working with\nunderserved populations. Through this process, the student-run teams are\ndiscovering untapped potential for future EV development and finding solutions\nthat could help local and national communities.\n\nThe entire first year is packed with intense research and planning. Students\ndon't even get to put their hands on a car until year two; meanwhile, they\nlearn how to work together and communicate as a team. They run simulations\nwith propulsion controls and modeling, and by the time they have access to a\nvehicle, they're ready to dive in.\n\nUniversity of Alabama student Corban Walsh explains that during the\nprototyping process, automakers like Cadillac end up with a fleet of pre-\nproduction vehicles that can't be resold. Walsh and his team were given a\npractically new all-electric Lyriq with just 17,000 miles (27,400 km) on it,\nand they decided their goal was to transform it from a rear-wheel-drive to an\nall-wheel-drive configuration and boost the horsepower from 300 to 550 (223 to\n373 kW). With tasks like that, one might think this is an ideal club for car\nfanatics. But Walsh says the team has diverse interests and is in fact very\nsoftware- and planning-focused.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYear one is research and planning.\n\nEcoCar\n\n\"In some ways, we attract the 'car guy' type of person, but at the end of the\nday, you don't have to be a car guy,\" Walsh says. \"You can even forget it's a\ncar sometimes.\"\n\nAny student can join the EcoCar EV Challenge, and general onboarding\nfamiliarizes them with the tracks and teams they can join. First, they take a\nlab tour and view required safety videos; then, they choose a subteam under\nthe general categories of hardware, integration, and software development. The\nConnected and Automated Vehicle Features subteam, for example, integrates\nsensor hardware and software, stitching together the data.\n\nAlong the way, small tasks lead to big advances. One of the first orders of\nbusiness for the Lyriq was to obtain a clean title and registration as a\nsalvage vehicle to be considered road-legal. Teams strip the cars down as far\nas they can, sometimes moving forward through a series of trials and errors.\nThey read all the manuals they can get their hands on, consulting with their\nGM mentor when they get stuck.\n\nGM also supplies some parts, allowing students to order a limited number from\nthe catalog. The University helps defray some of the cost, and companies like\nAmerican Axle donate critical components like motors. Natick, Massachusetts-\nbased Mathworks provides the simulation software the team needs for planning.\nStudents learn how to use the resources available on campus, too.\n\n\"One of the hardest but coolest things we've worked on was when we had to plan\nmountings for two new motors,\" Walsh says. \"We decided to use the on-campus\nfoundry where we can cast these parts.\"\n\nThe foundry had excellent advice for the team, Walsh says, helping them figure\nout how to make mountings that were strong enough to hold the motor and won't\ncause corrosion. They 3D-printed the part and made a ceramic mold, then burned\nout the plastic and let the metal harden.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n53\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Channel Ars Technica\n\n#### How Forza's Racing AI Uses Neural Networks To Evolve\n\nToday on War Stories, Ars Technica is joined by Dan Greenawalt, Creative\nDirector of the Forza franchise, who takes us through the colossal potential\n(and many challenges) of utilizing deep neural networks to build sophisticated\nracing AI. Beginning with the original Drivatar AI in Forza Motorsport for\nXBOX in 2005, Greenawalt and his colleagues experimented with computer\nlearning, refining their methods from iteration to iteration. It was once the\nAI system was unshackled from local hard drives and placed online in Forza\nMotorsport 5, however, that the floodgates truly opened. As the AI rapidly\nevolved, producing unexpected new behaviors, the Forza team quickly learned\nhow challenging it would be to wield this two-edged sword in creating\nrealistic opponents.\n\n  * ##### How Forza's Racing AI Uses Neural Networks To Evolve\n\n  * ##### The supercharged Ferrari 488 GTB | Ars Technica\n\n  * ##### Aston Martin's DB11 V12\n\n  * ##### Fast, fun, and freaky: A review of the Alfa Romeo Stelvio\n\n  * ##### The best features of the best cars at the L.A.
