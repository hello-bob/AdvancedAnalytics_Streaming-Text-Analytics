Gig workers in India train AI\nmodels through microtasks. India emerges as a data annotation hub with a\npotential $8.22 billion global market and a million-strong workforce by 2028.\n\nETtech\n\nAkash Pandey (26), a government job aspirant hailing from Basti, Uttar\nPradesh, chanced upon a flexible work opportunity online, which could fetch\nhim Rs 12,000-13,000 per project for transcribing audio and marking objects in\nimages.\n\n#Elections with ET\n\nLok Sabha Voting Phase 3: All the latest news\n\nMeanwhile, Ikshita Nagar (26), a young Delhi doctor preparing for the PG\nentrance test, put out some extra hours to identify the types of wounds in an\nimage to classify them as burns, abrasion or surgical, as well as to solve\nNEET questions.\n\n### Elevate Your Tech Prowess with High-Value Skill Courses\n\nOffering College| Course| Website  \n---|---|---  \nIndian School of Business| Professional Certificate in Product Management|\nVisit  \nMIT| MIT Technology Leadership and Innovation| Visit  \nIndian School of Business| ISB Product Management| Visit  \n  \nThousands of gig workers like Pandey and Nagar are becoming the backbone for\ntraining artificial intelligence-based large language models (LLMs) by taking\nup microtasks such as transcribing audio files, labelling images, translating\nlanguage, as well as marking boxes to identify objects in a self-driving clip\nand the best responses generated by a chatbot.\n\nby Taboola by Taboola\n\nSponsored Links Sponsored Links\n\nPromoted Links Promoted Links\n\nYou May Like\n\nTreppenlift-Vergleich\n\nRentner in Riesa: So kosten Treppenlifte fast nichtsTreppenlift-Vergleich\n\nUndo\n\nIndia is fast emerging as a hub for data annotation services with flexible\nworkers, mid-tier business analysts and even skilled data engineers\ncontributing to build high-quality datasets.\n\nData annotation, or simply data labelling, is the most crucial and\nfoundational step for building high-quality datasets to train AI models,\nenhance accuracy, curtail hallucinations and build safety guardrails against\ninappropriate or harmful content.\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\n/\n\nDuration 50:00\n\nLoaded: 0.20%\n\n00:00\n\nStream Type LIVE\n\nRemaining Time -50:00\n\n1x\n\n  * Chapters\n\n  * descriptions off, selected\n\n  * captions settings, opens captions settings dialog\n  * captions off, selected\n\n  * default, selected\n\nThis is a modal window.\n\nBeginning of dialog window.

Of this,\nthe market serviced by India can exceed $7 billion by 2030 with a workforce of\nup to 1 million.\n\nAccording to HR services company TeamLease, 20,000 full-time workers are\nengaged in the managed services paradigm as annotators in India. Across\ninternational platforms, 50,000 Indian annotators are actively employed as\nindependent contractors.\n\n\u201cAnnotation-as-a-service is on a meteoric rise especially in India,\u201d said Alok\nAggarwal, a celebrated author and chief executive of AI startup ScryAI.\n\nThere are more than 400,000 annotators worldwide. The number is expected to\ndouble every three years, thereby having almost 6 million workers in this\nfield by 2040, he said.\n\nGlobal AI companies Databricks, Fractal, Tredence and startups like Cropin and\nMinus Zero said they are expanding the team of in-house experts for faster,\ncost-effective data annotation while also depending on outsourced services in\nIndia.\n\n\u201cFor the entire MLOps (machine learning operations) pipeline, human-in-the-\nloop is crucial for handling biases, ensuring accuracy and reliability,\u201d said\nRajesh Ramdas, senior director, field engineering, Databricks India. The San\nFrancisco-based data analytics and AI company has recently released a DBRX\n132-billion parameter model.\n\n\u201cAs more and more software programming is taken over by generative AI and new\ndemands for labelling data to train the most complex AI models emerges, I see\na lot of workforce shifting to this domain,\u201d he said.\n\nChennai-based Desicrew Solutions, which counts Uber, Disney Hotstar and Toyota\nas clients, said it has grown on an average at 50% over the past 3-4 years,\ndriven by the increasing demand for annotation for LLMs. Further, the need for\nannotation and the complexity of tasks have grown significantly for training\nLLMs.\n\nManivannan JK, Desicrew\u2019s chief executive, said annotation for LLMs is much\nmore nuanced compared to classical AI or ML systems.\n\n\u201cLLMs have taken it to the next level, where they (annotators) are looking at\nnuances like sentiments,\u201d he said, adding that India offered skilled labour in\nabundance with lower operating costs for such services.\n\nThe original trend started around 2003-04 with Amazon, Walmart, Target and\nother ecommerce companies, which initially used workers in India to label\ntheir products and create catalogues.\n\nHowever, not all data records can be labelled by humans.\n\n\u201cSelf-supervised learning and the availability of open-source datasets bring\ndown the cost, time and effort needed for manual tasks of sorting and marking\ndata,\u201d said Suraj Amonkar, chief AI research & platforms officer at Fractal.\n\nThe company has built India\u2019s first text-to-image diffusion model, Kalaido.ai,\ntrained on a public dataset of 70 million images and capable of understanding\ntext prompts in 17 Indian languages including Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu\nand Sanskrit.\n\n\u201cAs we are heading towards increasing complexity of training multimodal LLMs\nacross text, speech, image, video, code etc., especially in low-resource\nlanguages such as those in India, skilled annotators will be required to build\nethical guardrails into these innovations,\u201d he added.\n\nSoumendra Mohanty, chief strategy officer at San Jose-based data science firm\nTredence, said annotation is evolving as a sub-segment at multiple firms with\nminimum qualification of a business analyst possessing domain knowledge.\n\nBesides building foundational models, enterprises that are fine-tuning LLMs on\nproprietary data in sectors such as healthcare need specialised skills for\nlabelling the data, said Hardik Dave, founder and CEO of startup IndikaAI.\n\u201cWhile an average labeller can make Rs25k-30k on Flexibench, a radiologist can\nmake up to Rs1 lakh/month for a few hours of work.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Nagar sees this as an opportunity beyond a second income.\n\u201cAnnotation became a practice ground for me while I was preparing for my NEET\nPG examination for specialisation. This is also an avenue where practicing\ndoctors can participate in innovation happening in corporate healthcare.\u201d\n\nNagar freelances with a team of professionals and amateurs on Flexibench, a\nmanaged services platform created by AI data startup Indika.AI. The platform\nhosts an on-demand workforce of 23,000 registered contributors for\nprogrammatic data labelling and fine-tuning of foundation models.\n\n#### Read More News on\n\ndata annotationAI modelsgig workersIndiaLLMs\n\n#### Poll of the Day\n\n### Will Wipro's fortunes reverse under a new CEO?\n\n##### Latest from ET\n\n  * Banks likely to appeal RBI's tough project finance proposal\n  * Baba Kalyani rejects claim of nephew, niece over assets\n  * A big consumer tide is coming to India.
