Image\nsource: Frank Folwell\n\nIt\u2019s likely you thought of the USSR, where so-called bread lines became a\nhallmark of the late Soviet era. These queues left us with enduring images\ndepicting the failure of a modern, developed state \u2014 with the second most\nsuccessful space agency in the world \u2014 to reliably deliver groceries to its\npeople.\n\nBy the late eighties, the destructive influence of centralised five year\neconomic plans, market interference and price controls had over-spilled into\nthe general availability of food, books and clothing. Just about everything\nrequired lining up and waiting, often for hours, with no guarantee that what\nyou desired would still be available when you reached the front of the queue.\n\nIf you cannot determine access to goods by price, demand can only be allocated\nby first-come-first-serve and subsequent shortages, or rationing \u2014 or some\ncombination of both. Even in a system of allocative rationing there will be\nsystemic leakage, as unavoidable market pressures forcibly reestablish\nthemselves through informal arrangements and favours, black markets, and of\ncourse, outright bribery.\n\nLikewise supply. Because prices could not be set by a combination of consumer\npreference and the cost factors of production, Soviet farmers were forced to\nsupply whatever meagre, underwhelming produce that fixed prices could allow\nthem to produce.\n\nThis led to the phenomenon of \u2018Bush legs\u2019, where ordinary Russians were\nshocked by the size, taste and succulence of more than 200 tonnes of free\nmarket chicken imported to Russia from the United States, following a 1990\ntrade agreement signed by then Soviet leader, Michael Gorbachev and US\nPresident, George H. W. Bush.\n\nA woman buying chicken meat in the USSR. Image source: Vitaly Belousov/Tass.\n\n#\n\nSupplier? I hardly know \u2018er!\n\nAnother country you might have thought of when asked to picture a line of\nweary citizens, queueing up to purchase basic goods of which there are limited\ncould be the United Kingdom, where there is a severe shortage of supply\nrelative to demand in housing \u2014 where people will literally queue in their\ndozens to view a small two bedroom terrace house. To rent, not to buy, of\ncourse.\n\nThe Sun reported that more than 160 people booked viewings to rent this two\nbedroom terrace house in Chadwell Heath, East London, marketed at \u00a31200 PCM.\nIt was later rented for higher than asking price. Image source: The\nIndependent.\n\nQueues don\u2019t have to be physical lines of people, as anyone trying to contact\na utilities provider by phone will be well aware. The BBC reported last year\nthat the average queue of tenants requesting to view a retail property has\nlengthened to 25 \u2014 up from six in 2019 \u2014 with prices increasing by 10% between\nJuly-September 2022 and 2023, using data from Rightmove.\n\n> Ria Laitmer, lettings manager at Clarkes agents in Bournemouth, said: \u2018The\n> gap between high demand and a severe shortage of rental stock at the moment\n> is just crazy.\n>\n> \u2018We're receiving mounting enquiries for each property to rent from would-be\n> tenants, with queues of tenants arriving to open-house viewings and the\n> majority being left disappointed as there are just not enough properties on\n> the market to meet the demand.\u2019\n\nSo far, so familiar. But unlike in the Soviet Union, we are lucky enough to be\nable to much more freely observe price signals, distorted as they are, in\naddition to noticing queues. Prices are a very important piece of information.\nThey tell us the equilibrium point of demand relative to supply. The point at\nwhich free agents are willing to exchange goods and services.\n\n##\n\nJapanese holdouts\n\nWe are being told in the clearest possible terms, by the highest house prices\nsince Queen Victoria was on the throne, that housing supply is not adequately\nable to respond to housing demand. Most goods become better or cheaper\nrelative to incomes over time (otherwise, what would be the point in economic\ngrowth?) British housing, along with many other countries with restrictive\nplanning policies, is an exception.\n\nWe might also look abroad and see our own equivalent of \u2018Bush legs\u2019 when we\ncompare the quality, abundance and floorspace of housing in other, comparable\ndeveloped nations. If you are a prolific scroller of TikTok, you might have\nnoticed that videos filmed in an average American home have rooms that look\nmuch nicer and are substantially larger than TikToks filmed closer to home.\n\nAverage residential floor space in square metres. Image source:\nwww.shrinkthatfootprint.com.\n\nScarcity also leads to all possible personal efficiencies being made in the\nconsumption of goods. The UK has one of the lowest proportions of vacant\ndwellings in the OECD, precisely because housing is so expensive \u2014 caused by\nthe relative shortage of homes per capita. People must make the best of what\nthey are being allocated by the rationing system.\n\nPercentage of vacant dwellings out of the total dwelling stock, 2020 or latest\nyear available. Image source: OECD.\n\nThe UK also has shrinking floorspace per person in the faster-to-respond and\nexpanding private rented sector, as houses are subdivided into flats, living\nrooms are converted to bedrooms, and cost-squeezed tenants move into smaller\nproperties to manage their personal finances and account for the systemic\nsupply shortage. Younger renters would like to consume housing equivalent to\nor better than generations before them, but this is rendered unaffordable by\nrationed housing supply.\n\nFloorspace per person in England and London by tenure. Image source: Greater\nLondon Authority.\n\nIt\u2019s rather odd, given the abundance of evidence that we have a supply crisis,\nthat we still see supply deniers or doubters in the housing policy space \u2014\nappearing like Japanese holdouts hiding in ideological jungles, long after the\nend of the war.\n\nThe spectrum runs from nakedly anti-growth and living standards supply denial,\nto softer scepticism that revolves around the idea that supply and planning\nreform is necessary and good, but not sufficient, to make housing more\naffordable. A report released by the Social Market Foundation (SMF) this week\nsits at this well-meaning end of the spectrum.\n\nThe report accurately describes much of the governmental and policy landscape\non how our planning system restricts the supply of homes. It also fairly\ncovers the advantages, disadvantages and potential political difficulties and\ndisappointments that planning reforms, with the aim of increasing build-out\nrates, might run into. But if we follow some of the logic in the report to its\nconclusion we must infer that we have created a perpetual wealth machine,\nwhich would be a surprising finding.\n\n> Even where supply does increase, there is no guarantee the increase will be\n> large or that the new units will be affordable. In fact, planning reform has\n> in some cases been blamed for worsening the affordability crisis through\n> gentrification, as changes to the land\u2019s capacity increases its land value\n> without increasing supply. Here we refer to \u2018gentrification\u2019 as the\n> disproportionate increase in local home prices or rents relative to the\n> region as a whole.\n>\n> In cases like New York, new units worsened affordability by building at or\n> above market rates or being designed as \u201cluxury homes.\u201d In these cases,\n> policymakers promised that the deflationary effects caused by the new supply\n> would outweigh the inflationary effects of higher prices. Yet in practice,\n> limited supply and high prices combined to decrease affordability.\n\nIf prices do not fall when additional supply is delivered, then we have either\nfound a way to generate infinite wealth by building as many homes as we can \u2014\nor, as seems more likely, we should draw the opposite conclusion from building\nhomes is not the long-run answer to affordability.\n\nInstead, we should understand that housing demand is extremely inelastic,\nprecisely because the shortage is so severe. In other words, people are so\ndesperate to consume more housing that they will pay extortionate amounts to\nreceive even the most desultory crumb.\n\nA perpetual wealth machine made of housing. It seems unlikely that we have\ninvented such a device. And even if we have, we are not using it to become\ninfinitely rich.\n\nThe SMF report appears to assume that upward trends in planning permits is an\nongoing inevitability, rather than something that may require sustained\npolitical and policy pressure to remain feasible, and focuses in on narrow\ntime windows.\n\nIt does, however, correctly identify that planning reform that appears to\nimprove permitting on a surface level will not result in more planning\nconsents or houses unless it can reliably deliver government approval outcome\nas well as intent, and is unconstrained by the details of adjacent policy\nareas.\n\nThis is an argument for a better policy development and implementation, not an\nargument against supply-side reform as an answer to the affordability\nquestion.\n\nThe effects of planning reform in Auckland, New Zealand. Image source: Works\nin Progress.\n\nMore broadly, a common theme on the left end of the housing policy spectrum is\n(likely unintentional) data dredging to facilitate supply scepticism and avoid\nmarket-based solutions. Novel research that goes against the consensus is more\nlikely to be noted and shared, especially if it facilitates an easy answer for\npoliticians keen to avoid telling existing homeowners that building in their\nback yard will, in fact, be necessary.\n\nAnother left focus is affordability requirement policy solutions. Such\nrequirements necessarily make development more costly or less beneficial for\ndevelopers (or these would not be mandated by policy) and are one of the ways\nmost western governments have attempted to make housing more affordable for\nthe last 20 years: trying to use regulation to regulate existing regulatory\noutcomes into into behaving properly. Price signals be damned.\n\nThis approach to housing can be expressed in various ways: affordability\nrequirements for developments, rent controls, and the UK Government\u2019s Help to\nBuy government loan scheme, Help to Buy ISAs, and Lifetime ISAs. Each are a\ndemand-side attempt to argue a market into submission. But markets fight back.\n\n#\n\nThe Great British Housing Famine\n\nThe SMF report suggests the following:\n\n> Affordability requirements following a 60-30-20 rule which provides tax\n> incentives for property if they agree to a price such that households making\n> 60% of the local area\u2019s median income do not need to pay more than 30% of\n> their wages on rent or mortgage payments in 20% of units.\n\nA focus on affordability over supply puts the cart before the horse. If we\nlook to other examples of extreme supply constriction, such as famines, would\nnot advise against delivering additional grain to the affected region unless\nit is \u2018affordable\u2019.\n\nDelivering one additional sack of wheat will not lower the market price. But\nthat does not mean that it will not be hungrily consumed, or that it cannot\nrepresent the beginning of the end of a supply crisis, should it be the first\nof many more. If prices do not fall when supply is delivered, this indicates\nconsumers are very hungry for the good or service they are purchasing.\n\nDoes a situation where we are forcing people to pay extortionate rents or\nration housing consumption by converting living rooms into bedrooms not sound\nlike a famine?\n\nSubsidising housing rents or purchase prices, or mandating \u2018affordability\u2019\n(when supply is constrained) forces wider market rents and prices to rise.\nThere is no supply escape valve that can respond to the additional capital\ninput or restrictions, which means market prices are forced to rise with no\nadditional quality or quantity benefit to housing consumers \u2014 unless the\nconsumer already own housing equity, which will increase in value.\n\nEven then, this only advantages them relative to their peers without capital.\nWhat use is an expensive, low floorspace, poor quality house compared to a\ncheap, high quality, high floorspace house?\n\nDemand side subsidies with restricted supply therefore represent a large\nadditional transfer of wealth to the existing owners of capital, topped off\nwith access to even greater economic rents \u2014 with profound implications for\nwealth inequality, intergenerational inequality, and the social contract\nitself.\n\nWe might say this is worthwhile, if it means that housing becomes \u2018affordable\u2019\nthrough subsidy to the least well off. But it is a cursed choice of temporary\nconvenience, and delivers affordable housing by lottery. It forces cities to\nplay host to inefficient labour markets, encouraging high-productivity workers\nto give up and seek better living standards elsewhere, while not addressing\nthe core reason for the affordability crisis, and doubling down on the\ndeadweight losses of restricted housing supply.\n\n#\n\nFolk economics\n\nFocusing on policy-mandated affordability over supply seems to be an\nexpression of \u2018folk economics\u2019 \u2014 how people intuitively understand economics.\nFor housing, folk economics diverges substantially from the observable and\nmeasurable reality in a way that it does not for other markets.\n\nNall, Elmendorf, and Oklobdzija, found that: \u201830%-40% of Americans believe,\ncontrary to basic economic theory and robust empirical evidence, that a large,\nexogenous increase in their region\u2019s housing stock would cause rents and home\nprices to rise.\u2019\n\nIntuitive understanding of the impact of supply shocks on markets diverges\nsubstantially by product. Image source: Nall, Elmendorf and Okolobdzija, 2022.\n\nPerhaps this is simply an expression of how illiquid real estate is. It is far\neasier to imagine a supply shock causing a price rise or fall in oil, and\nsubsequently in petrol prices. Maybe the infrequency of house purchases and\nthe emotional connection to our own homes is the cause of the distortion.\n\nBut when it comes to solutions, we can continue celebrating affordability\ncriteria like tractor production figures, or can start to notice the large\nqueues outside the bakery. There is a housing famine.\n\nWe have tried demand subsidies, as have many of our peer nations, time and\ntime again \u2014 in guises as varied as Help to Buy, affordability criteria,\nshared ownership and targeted ISAs. Yet we still have one of the worst housing\naffordability crises in the world. What conclusion should we draw from this?\n\nI hope you enjoyed this Himbonomics post.
