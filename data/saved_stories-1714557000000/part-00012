Before it was a reservoir, manufactured by the United\nStates government\u2019s Grand Coulee Dam, this was once a mighty, salmon-rich\nstretch of the Columbia River that formed the basis of an entire ecosystem \u2014\nand that supported the 12 tribes of the Colville Confederated Tribes since\ntime immemorial.\n\nThe boat belongs to Rose Piccinini, the tribes\u2019 Sanpoil district wildlife\nbiologist. She is part of a team that manages the herd of bighorn sheep that\nthe tribes\u2019 wildlife department first reintroduced in 2009. She also leads the\ntribes\u2019 efforts to restore lynx populations back into the ecosystem here.\n\nTribal Wildlife Biologist Rose Piccinini counting bighorn sheep from the\nHellgate herd along the Columbia River on the Colville Tribes reservation.\nThese animals were restored to the reservation by the tribes. Credit: David\nMoskowitz\n\nThe animals who shared this landscape were once fully integrated into every\naspect of tribal members\u2019 lives. They harvested bighorn sheep and other game\nfor food, tools and clothing. Intricate myths, legends, and teachings about\nthe animals were passed down by elders to descendants and bound them to who\nthey were \u2014 and who, as a result, their descendants came to be.\n\nBut then American settlers brought domesticated sheep and goats, and with\nthem, diseases that bighorns weren\u2019t able to recover from. The succession of\ndisease exposures, against which bighorns had little defense, significantly\nreduced their numbers and made them more vulnerable to impacts they might have\notherwise withstood. Save for a few small pockets in secluded locations, the\nbighorns died off, and the herds disappeared from the landscape and the lives\nof the tribes.\n\nAs we crane our necks and squint our eyes upward in the hot midday July sun,\nshadows reveal more than a dozen bighorn sheep on the north side of the\ncanyon, less than 30 meters (100 feet) above the reservoir. Ewes and lambs\nweave paths through stalks of mullein (Verbascum thapsus), leaving their\ncrescent-shaped tracks in the sand, all the while feeding on shrubs that dot\nthe hillside and scree. Their sharp horns curl back from their heads as their\namber eyes attend to their surroundings. Two of the animals walk onto a sandy\nsection of the slope, licking at minerals. They kick up dust and cascades of\nsand, which form rivulets and accumulate into plumes, slowly fanning down the\nsandy slope to the shoreline below.\n\nBighorn Sheep from the Hellgate herd along the Columbia River on the Colville\nTribes reservation.

Credit: David Moskowitz\n\nFor the 12 tribes of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville, whose\nreservation is located in north-central Washington state, their ecosystem\nisn\u2019t complete without the animals and plants who have long inhabited the land\nalongside them. Maintaining these relationships of reciprocity in modern times\ninvolves the protection and reintroduction of native species, as well as the\nrestoration of their habitats, an ambitious effort that the tribes\u2019 wildlife\ndepartment has been leading since its inception in the 1970s.\n\nAs the tribes work together to restore populations of more native species like\nbighorn sheep and salmon to their lands and waters, they bring collective\nhealing with them. This healing is felt by the people who have long endured\ncultural trauma from the forces of European and American colonization. It\nfurther strengthens their enduring resilience.\n\nBIGHORNS WERE AMONG the tribes\u2019 first relatives to be extirpated from the\nregion, but the world-shattering impacts of colonization only intensified\nhenceforth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSalmon have always been at the center of the tribes\u2019 culture and, until the\nmid-20th century, their diet and economy. The fish fed the people and the land\nwith, among other things, the nutrients stored in their bodies. The fish\nconsumed sea life and later carried this sustenance upstream in their\nmigratory journey inland. Tribal representatives cite reports of 20,000 salmon\nper day, weighing on average 15 kilograms (35 pounds) each, swimming up the\nColumbia. With their death and decomposition, the nutrients brought by the\nsalmon in their flesh and bones nourished the forests, prairies, and riparian\nareas, as well as the coyotes, deer, elk, bighorn sheep, lynx, pronghorn,\nbuffalo, wolves, eagles, and innumerable other beings interconnected within\nthese systems.\n\nShelly Boyd, cultural leader for the Lakes Band, also known as the Sinixt, of\nthe Colville Confederated Tribes photographed at the location of Kettle Falls,\na traditionally vital fishing location, which was drowned by the Grand Coulee\nDam. Credit: David Moskowitz\n\nBut in 1942, the U.S. government built the Grand Coulee Dam and \u201cended a way\nof life,\u201d according to a documentary produced by the tribes. The dam blocked\n2,250 kilometers (1,400 miles) of salmon spawning habitat and flooded 22,600\nhectares (56,000 acres) of land, as well as the ecosystems that supported\nwhole communities of animals and people. This included critical winter habitat\nfor deer and elk, and areas the tribes relied on for native food and medicinal\nplants, all of which were drowned by the government\u2019s dam construction.\n\nNo fish passage was built then, nor since.\n\n\u201cOvernight, it was shut off,\u201d says Richard Whitney, a member of the Sinixt\nband of the Colville Confederated Tribes and the tribes\u2019 wildlife department\nmanager, who assumed leadership of the department in 2014. All at once,\nsalmon, who were the tribes\u2019 staple food and the foundation of their culture\nand economy, were gone.\n\nThe Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River, finished in 1942 by the US federal\ngovernment destroyed all anadromous salmon runs above. The dam is a mile wide,\n550 feet tall and backs up the river for over 150 miles. The river marks the\nboundary of the Colville Reservation (which lies to the north, lower section\nof photo).

By\n1975, the tribes had established a wildlife management department with funding\nfrom the Bureau of Indian Affairs, in accordance with the Bureau\u2019s trust\nresponsibilities to the Indigenous peoples with whom it had signed treaties.\nElk (Cervus canadensis nelsoni), Whitney says, have, \u201cstepped up to offer\nthemselves so [the tribes] could persist.\u201d\n\nToday, thanks to the tribes\u2019 reintroduction efforts, their elk herds are\nstrong, growing from 481 total elk counted in 2002, to more than double that\nin 2022. Whitney says elk numbers on the reservation are at a 20-year high,\nwhich gives Tribal members additional opportunities for harvest.\n\nWith elk reintroduction efforts underway, the tribes next turned their\nattention to sharp-tailed grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus) in the late 1990s,\nthen bighorn sheep in 2005 and pronghorns (Antilocapra americana) in 2014,\nfollowed by lynx (Lynx canadensis), salmon, and buffalo (Bison bison).\n\nAlthough they have not reintroduced wolves (Canis lupus), the tribes have\nallowed the apex predators to recolonize their lands since discovering\nevidence in 2008 that wolves had started returning on their own. Wolf packs\nare now managed here at a stable level.\n\nThe Colville Confederated Tribes\u2019 plan to re-establish bighorn sheep began\nwith six translocations that ultimately brought 136 bighorns back to the\nreservation. Although the herds have continued to suffer from diseases carried\nby domesticated goats and sheep\u2014exposure that is worsened by drought as it\nconcentrates animals around smaller watering areas \u2014 Whitney says the\npopulation has since grown to more than 250.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWildlife Manager Richard Whitney oversees all of the tribes\u2019 projects to\nrestore wildlife to their unceded lands. Credit: David Moskowitz\n\nAs Whitney assumed leadership of the wildlife division and took over the\nrestoration of bighorn sheep, it was suggested to him that the tribes sell\nlicenses for trophy bighorn hunts to non-tribal hunters to help pay for more\nstaff. Some state fish and wildlife departments sell hunting licenses via\nauction or raffle for a number of species considered to be trophies to the\nhighest bidder to generate revenue. For example, in Washington this year, one\nbighorn sheep hunting license generated $181,460, while a similar license was\nauctioned for $370,00 in Oregon.\n\nWhitney was adamantly opposed to the idea, and his reasoning provides insight\ninto the approach he takes to wildlife management: \u201cThat animal is worth more\nto me than a biologist position. That animal has value and it\u2019s not in\ndollars,\u201d he says. With so much wildlife management reliant on hunters paying\nlicense fees, which in turn fund conservation and management, Whitney says the\npriorities are off. \u201cIf it just comes down to money, then you guys are in the\nwrong business. You\u2019ll never get it right.\u201d\n\n> \u201cThat animal has value and it\u2019s not in dollars.\u201d\n\nIn addition to providing sustenance for tribal members, the restoration of\nnative species serves to restore a community of species of which people are an\nintegral part. \u201cThere\u2019s a harmony there, and anything that\u2019s missing breaks\nthat balance,\u201d Whitney says. \u201cThere\u2019s still a harmony, but it\u2019s missing a note\nhere and there.\u201d With each member of the ecological community Whitney\u2019s\nwildlife department restores, the whole community sings fuller-voiced.\n\nPronghorn antelope on the Colville Tribes reservation. The tribes restored\npronghorn to their reservation in the 2010s. Credit: David Moskowitz\n\nRICHARD WHITNEY WAS RAISED on the reservation, and was always in the woods,\ncutting firewood, hunting, fishing, or just being \u201cout there, on the rez,\u201d\nespecially with his father and uncle. \u201cIt\u2019s always been an important part of\nmy life. I feel like I belong in nature,\u201d he says. This sense of belonging,\nrooted in a culture with ancient ancestral connections to the land they reside\non, dovetailed with the scientific management of natural resources when\nWhitney began a series of internships with the tribes\u2019 forestry, fisheries and\nwildlife departments at the age of 14. He went on to earn his Master\u2019s degree\nfrom Washington State University in natural resource sciences, studying sharp-\ntailed grouse. Nearly a decade ago, Whitney took his current position as the\ntribes\u2019 wildlife program manager.\n\nSoon after taking the position in 2014, Whitney began leading pronghorn\nrestoration efforts for the tribes. Using knowledge gained from habitat\nevaluation surveys he\u2019d worked on previously, as well as feasibility reports\nfrom the 1990s and early 2000s, he determined that the region offered plenty\nof suitable pronghorn habitat. In addition, he and his team looked at\npronghorn reintroduction attempts by a number of other agencies to determine\nwhat had worked and what hadn\u2019t. The Yakama Nation, for example, had\nsuccessfully restored pronghorn in the past, while the state of Washington had\ntried, but failed.\n\nPronghorn antelope on the Colville Tribes reservation. The tribes restored\npronghorn to their reservation in the 2010s. Credit: David Moskowitz\n\nIn January 2016, after determining there was adequate habitat and food on the\nreservation, Whitney and his team reintroduced 52 pronghorn. Some of those\nanimals died, likely due to stress and overexertion during transport. In the\nproject\u2019s second year, the team introduced 98 pronghorn \u2014 earlier in the year\n(in October rather than in mid-winter) and in smaller groups, shortly after\nthey had been captured. Survival of reintroduced animals greatly improved in\nyear two, providing valuable information on reintroductions for the future\n\nNow, on a sunny July day, Sam Rushing drives us in his pickup truck through\nthe hills outside of Bridgeport on the reservation to see the results. He is\nthe tribes\u2019 Omak-Nespelem district wildlife biologist and is looking for some\nof the pronghorn the tribes reintroduced from Nevada seven years earlier. We\nscan the open, grassy hillsides in the valley, near a wildfire burn scar,\nuntil we spot a herd in the flats near a creek bottom, between two tall\nponderosa pines. Spooked by our presence, the group of nearly two-dozen\nanimals \u2014 does, fawns and one large buck \u2014 trot uphill together. Rushing says\nthe tribes\u2019 herd now numbers 225.\n\nFor Whitney and his relatives, animals are friends and often referred to as\nsuch. \u201cWe don\u2019t rule the kingdom, but are part of it by relating with\nfriends,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re reuniting with old friends. We\u2019re restoring a\ncommunity, restoring the system.\u201d\n\n> \u201cWe\u2019re reuniting with old friends.

As they wait, the sun illuminates the\nsky\u2014blue, save a few passing clouds\u2014and shines down through the ponderosa\npines and into the river, the rays of light twirling through currents and\ndappling the round stones below.\n\nMembers of the tribe form a line between a fish-hauling truck and the river.\nThey pass Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha)\u2014one after the other, from\none to another\u2014in specially designed rubber bags toward the river, returning\nthe generous offering of life to the salmon, and in turn, the animals and\nland. At the end of the line, in one continuous motion, Patrick Tonasket,\nKeller District representative for the tribal council, gently pulls a large\nChinook by the tail from a bag and orients the fish in the current\u2019s flow. He\nholds his right hand on the salmon\u2019s broad back until the fish feels the\ncurrent\u2019s rush, then flicks her tail and jets upstream.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re dedicated to bringing those salmon back,\u201d Tonasket says quietly.\n\nDarnell Sam, Salmon chief for the Wenatchi standing in the San Poil river\nwatching chinook being released into the river.

Prior to the\noperation, biologists working for the tribes had ensured that the fish were\nfree of disease and had inserted tiny monitoring tags before trucking them\nupriver for the ceremonial release. These releases give tribal members the\nopportunity to hold ceremony with and for the salmon. With each salmon\nreleased, healing and hope surges through those gathered by the river. Later\non, the proof that salmon can spawn in this river will most likely reinforce\nhabitat and model assessments, aiding in future reintroduction efforts by\nproving they can succeed.\n\n\u201cThe salmon used to run strong here,\u201d says Darnell Sam, a descendant of the\nSanpoil Band of the Colville Confederated Tribes. Sam is the Wenatchi Salmon\nChief, and leads a ceremony for these fish, whom, he says, in the beginning,\noffered themselves to the people so they could survive. Sam is also the great\nnephew of Chief Jim James of the Sanpoil, who presided over the Ceremony of\nTears, when his relatives\u2019 millennia-old salmon fishery at Kettle Falls was\ninundated following the construction of Grand Coulee Dam. Now, Sam stands in\nthe river, his shirt adorned with images of mountain lions and white and blue\nribbons that pulse in breeze, and he releases a salmon to the river, as the\nsun shines down.\n\nSam says the salmon have always run parallel to his people, specifically\nregarding their resilience: \u201cThey\u2019ve endured a lot. Our people have endured a\nlot. ... They\u2019ve been colonized; they\u2019ve been oppressed. So has the salmon,\nbut yet, they still endure, and they still survive, and they\u2019re still here.\u201d\nRecalling the Ceremony of Tears for Kettle Falls, where his ancestors mourned\nthe loss of the salmon from Grand Coulee Dam, he says, \u201cThis is an opportunity\nfor us to wipe them tears.\u201d\n\nFirst light on the forested Kettle Mountains where the Colville Tribes are\nrecovering Canada Lynx. Credit: David Moskowitz\n\nTHE KETTLE MOUNTAIN RANGE runs north-south along the eastern flank of the\nColville reservation and north into the tribes\u2019 ancestral territory in\nColville National Forest. Lynx are known to live in the Kettle Mountains, but\nin very low numbers, and likely only as transients.\n\n> The Endangered Species Act\u2019s complicated legacy in Indian Country\n\nThe species is listed as endangered in the state of Washington and threatened\nunder the federal Endangered Species Act. But lynx once existed in abundance\nin Washington state\u2014including on the tribes\u2019 ancestral territories\u2014before\ncolonization, habitat destruction, trapping, and climate change-worsened\nwildfires all took their toll. These compounding factors have had a lasting\nimpact on the region\u2019s lynx population.\n\nWhile the cats are protected in the U.S., they are still trapped without limit\nin British Columbia. Many of these lynx might otherwise migrate south across\nthe border. But without that natural influx, human-aided immigration may be\nnecessary for the survival of lynx, at least in Washington state. In 2013, an\ninteragency task force was formed and affirmed the importance of the Kettle\nRange in conserving lynx in the U.S. because of its viable connection to\nexisting habitats and populations north of the border.\n\nClimate change and the growing threat of catastrophic wildfires are key\nreasons for the lynx\u2019s precarious conservation status. While lower intensity\nfires historically created mosaics of lynx habitat, massive wildfires, which\nbegan in earnest throughout the region in 2002, have burned entire swaths of\nthe Okanogan Mountain Range, including some of the state\u2019s few core lynx\nhabitats. By 2019, fires like these had substantially impacted 50% of the\nsuitable lynx range in the Okanogan Mountains.\n\nIn this era of climate change, widespread drought, and wildfires of increasing\nfrequency and intensity, the already-small lynx population in Washington could\nsoon be left without adequate habitat. Lynx disappearing from the state has\nbecome a real possibility.\n\nSanpoil District wildlife biologist Rose Piccinini, who is not a tribal\nmember, grew up close to the land, due north of the reservation in an area\nknown as the \u201cNorth Half,\u201d where the tribes maintain traditional hunting,\nfishing and gathering rights. \u201cI always am proud to say that I work for the\ntribe, and I think part of it is that connection to the land and the\nconnection to the animals, and the holistic way the tribe looks at managing,\u201d\nshe says. \u201cI don\u2019t work in a vacuum, only looking at lynx and lynx habitat,\nbut recognizing that all of the animals are important, and part of the picture\nand part of that balance that we\u2019re trying to restore.\u201d\n\nAssessments conducted by Washington State University and the nonprofit\nConservation Northwest between 2013 and 2019 determined the Kettle Mountains\nstill contained a small number of likely transient lynx and adequate habitat\nand food for lynx to be re-established there, despite the heavy impacts that\nmegafires have had in the Okanogan Mountains.\n\nWith this evidence in hand, Whitney, as the tribes\u2019 wildlife department\ndirector, gave his department the go-ahead to jump on board. The 5-year plan\nwas to translocate 10 lynx per year from British Columbia to the Colville\nReservation. They hoped the lynx would make their homes there and begin to\nreproduce. In addition to restoring the community, a major goal was to provide\nan additional population in western North America as well as increase the\nchances of connectivity with lynx in B.C. and an existing population in the\nOkanogan highlands.\n\nThe first season, which ran from November 2021 to February 2022, saw three of\nthe nine introduced lynx return to Canada. One of those later made her way\nback down to the Kettle Mountains, demonstrating that north-south connectivity\nwas not only possible but happening.\n\n> How do you count the elusive lynx?\n\nDuring the second season, in October 2022, the team trapped and released the\nanimals earlier in the fall instead of through winter as they had in the first\nyear. \u201cThey had an opportunity to get the lay of the land before the winter,\u201d\nPiccinini says. The team trapped and released 10 lynx the second year, two of\nwhich had been captured the first year and had returned to B.C. Earlier this\nyear, the team was planning to set up a geofence and use newer, better GPS-\ncollars to determine more precisely where and how lynx are moving between\nhabitats, which may inform future wildlife corridor projects.\n\nNow, at the beginning of the project\u2019s third year, all metrics point to\nsuccess. Of the surviving 17 lynx trapped and released in both years, 10\nappear to have established themselves in the Kettle Range, while four have\nreturned to B.C. Three of the relocated lynx have since died. This sobering\nnews, however, is at least partially offset by the likelihood of a new litter\nof kittens born on lands north of the reservation boundary, which if\nconfirmed, will help bolster the local population. Piccinini is anxiously\nawaiting confirmation from trail cameras she and tribal members have set up in\nthe area. Seven additional lynx were recently captured and, of those, five\nremain on the reservation.\n\nShelly Boyd releases a Canada lynx onto the Colville Tribe\u2019s reservation.\nCredit: David Moskowitz\n\nTHE RETURN OF LYNX to the Colville Confederated tribes\u2019 lands represents an\nimportant geographical reciprocity. Some of Whitney\u2019s human relatives, too,\nare re-establishing themselves in B.C., where they once lived with the lynx,\nthe salmon, the elk, and myriad other relatives. \u201cWe\u2019re intermingling,\u201d he\nsays. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken care of the habitat up there for us and ensured our\nreturn, so we\u2019re helping them return as well.\u201d\n\nThe territory of Whitney\u2019s band, the Sinixt, extends from Kettle Falls, in\nWashington State, to the Big Bend area north of Revelstoke, B.C. The Canadian\ngovernment declared the Sinixt people extinct in 1956 as they were negotiating\nthe first Columbia River Treaty. \u201cThey declared us extinct so they didn\u2019t have\nto do anything,\u201d Whitney told me in his office in Inchelium, Washington,\napproximately 24 miles as the crow flies from Kettle Falls, which now lies\ndormant beneath Franklin D. Roosevelt \u201cLake.\u201d\n\nIn order to have the Sinixts\u2019 rights recognized in Canada, Whitney\u2019s uncle,\nRichard Desautel (after whom Whitney is named), shot an elk in British\nColumbia on traditional Sinixt territory and turned himself in to the\nprovincial wildlife law enforcement agency. After a series of court victories\nand appeals in 2021, Desautel and the Sinixt won a landmark supreme court\nvictory in Canada that forced the government to recognize their Aboriginal\nrights in British Columbia. The tribe recently opened an office in Nelson,\nB.C. to further assert those rights.\n\nMeanwhile, the tribes haven\u2019t slowed their efforts to restore their community.\nNext up are burrowing owls, Whitney says, and if possible, buffalo. But only\nif they\u2019re allowed to run free, he says. Whitney cites historical evidence of\nthe presence of buffalo in the tribes\u2019 territory. \u201cA lot of stories I\u2019ve been\ntold were of folks back in the day who would jump on their horses, ride over\nto Montana, and round up a bunch of buffalo and bring them back. And then they\nwould persist, however many years, until they either ate them all, they\ndispersed too far, or they died,\u201d he says. The Kalispel Tribe recently gifted\nthe tribes 33 buffalo, which they released on the range at the beginning of\nOctober. \u201cOur goals are being developed and will be compiled into a bison\nmanagement plan over the winter months,\u201d Whitney says.\n\nWildlife manager and tribal member Richard Whitney sets a live trap for lynx\nin the Canadian Okanagan.

Credit: David Moskowitz\n\nWhitney loves the work of restoring his community. \u201cWe talk about animals like\npeople, like friends,\u201d he says. \u201cI grew up in the woods learning about\ndifferent animals, and spent time with my father and uncle. A lot of them\naren\u2019t around anymore,\u201d he says.\n\nWhitney thinks back to a separate ceremonial release of salmon he participated\nin at the inundated site of Kettle Falls, where he released salmon into waters\nthat hadn\u2019t known them since the dam blocked access to their ancestral\nspawning grounds. \u201cIt was pretty emotional,\u201d he says. Not long after, some of\nthose same salmon were caught by anglers in the Canadian reaches of the\nColumbia River. \u201cWe have proven that they will go to Canada,\u201d he says.\n\n> The Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe reintroduces bighorn sheep on tribal lands\n\nTraveling in parallel with Whitney and his Sinixt relatives in Canada, the\nsalmon are also traveling north. And along their way, the spawning salmon the\ntribes have released will provide information about the suitability of\nspawning habitat along their journey. In turn, this will likely put pressure\non the U.S. government to ensure that salmon can pass through the dams on the\nColumbia River and spawn through the Colville Confederated Tribes\u2019 lands on up\ninto the Canadian headwaters of the Columbia River.\n\nEssentially, voice by voice, individual by individual, the tribes are working\ntogether to restore, protect and sustain their community on lands under their\njurisdiction by managing those lands in line with their cultural and\ntraditional values with the aid of science. By strengthening the very fabric\nof the ecosystems their ancestors have been stewarding since time immemorial,\nthey\u2019re strengthening their vital role in those systems \u2014 in that community,\nin that chorus. In this way, the community itself evolves together toward a\nnatural balance that is abundant, resilient, and mutually reciprocal.\n\n\u201cIt makes my heart happy,\u201d Whitney says. \u201cIt heals me.\u201d\n\nThe tracks of a just-released lynx heading into the forest on the Colville\nReservation.
