The cover? Rotund. Husky. Still fast as lightning. The actual\n> game? 8-bit GLORY \ud83d\ude4c pic.twitter.com/a2k2j9mvXH\u2014 Google Play (@GooglePlay)\n> April 27, 2024\n\nSuch gaffs include saying the Mega Drive debut was \"8-bit GLORY\" to claiming\nthat Sonic Boom (2014) was made in 1993. Needless to say, Twitter's Community\nNotes feature has been used extensively to point out the inaccuracies\ncontained within each tweet.\n\nIn fact, almost every post contains a mistake \u2013 leading some to assume it's\nall intentional and purely done to generate engagement.\n\nImages: Google Play\n\nRegardless of the reasoning, even Sonic's official Twitter account felt\ncompelled to voice concern:\n\n> what are you doing\u2014 Sonic the Hedgehog (@sonic_hedgehog) April 28, 2024\n\nThe reaction online has been predictably one of complete bewilderment and\nconfusion, as you can see from the responses below:\n\n> This is one of the weirdest threads I\u2019ve seen in a while.
