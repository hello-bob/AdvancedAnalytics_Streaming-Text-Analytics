I promise.\n\nMister Branzino\n\nApr 30, 2024\n\n2\n\nShare this post\n\n#### 5 Top Food TV Shows\n\nmisterbranzino.substack.com\n\n5\n\nShare\n\nFood TV has been an essential ingredient in making me a better cook.\n\nMake a batch of popcorn because here are five of the best food TV shows (plus\ntwo bonus ones).\n\nThey will teach you how to cook and deepen your passion for food.\n\n#\n\n1) Escape to River Cottage\n\nHugh leaves the big city to live a bucolic life.\n\nEscape to River Cottage will teach you that nothing comes from nothing. Every\nlittle thing we eat takes hard work and patience to produce.\n\nMy favorite episode is when Hugh\u2019s hens lay their first. The joy he gets from\nmaking a simple omelette is inspiring.\n\nWatch on Amazon Prime\n\n#\n\n2) Midnight Diner\n\nFood isn\u2019t just about the food. It\u2019s about the stories surrounding each dish.\n\nI love Midnight Diner\u2019s structure. Diners come in and request a dish. If the\nchef has the ingredients, he\u2019ll make it. While you\u2019ll learn how to make the\ndish, each diner has a story that makes that dish so exciting.(I don\u2019t know\nwhy this show hasn\u2019t been recreated for an English speaking audience. Hello\nHollywood, I\u2019m waiting \ud83d\ude09)\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\n#\n\n3) The Great British Baking Show\n\nNo TV show is more heart-warming than The Great British Baking Show (or \u2018Bake\nOff\u2019). The camaraderie between contestants, the piercing stares from Paul\nHollywood and the extravagant baked creations all make this show a great way\nto unwind with. Oh and if you\u2019re a so-so baker like me, you\u2019ll actually learn\nhow to bake.\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\n#\n\n4) Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations + Parts Unknown\n\nTravel broadens the mind and opens your palette to new flavors. Anthony\nBourdain\u2019s No Reservations (and Parts Unknown) taught me how to travel. What\nlocals eat will teach you everything you need to know about a place. While\nmany of the spots Bourdain (RIP) are long gone, this show will make you more\nconfident trying new things wherever the wind may take you.\n\nWatch on HBO Max\n\n#\n\n5) Kitchen Nightmares\n\nGordon Ramsey is a bulldog in the kitchen. And for good reason. You don\u2019t get\nMichelin stars for being \u201ccool\u201d about cleanliness, organization and flavor. In\nKitchen Nightmares, Gordon teaches you how NOT to run a kitchen.\n\nI love when Gordon finally breaks the owner or chef to accept that nothing\nchanges if nothing changes. This show is also a reminder to never own a\nrestaurant.\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\n#\n\nBONUS #1: Marco Pierre White\u2019s Knorr Cooking Series\n\nMarco Pierre White was Gordon\u2019s mentor. Marco is a legendary cook and his\ncooking series for bouillon brand Knorr is the best cooking \u201cshow\u201d out there.\nEach video is jam packed with simple dishes and techniques that will elevate\nmake you a pro home cook in no time.\n\nOn Youtube\n\n#\n\nBonus #2: Monster Foodies\n\nSesame Street is the GOAT of kids TV. The Monster Foodies segment is my\nfavorite. The formula works every time: a kid requests a dish from Cookie\nMonster and Chef Gonger, Cookie Monster eats a key ingredient, Gonger gets\nupset, they go off find the ingredient at a farm or factory, they make the\nfood and send it back to the kid. I learn something new in every episode.\nYesterday I learned how cinnamon was made.\n\nWatch on PBS Kids\n\n#\n\nConclusion\n\nTV doesn\u2019t have to rot your brain. If you watch some of these top five food\nshows, you\u2019ll see that TV can be educational and entertaining.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite food TV show?

I've only watched bake-off, so I have\nsome streaming to do! ;)It's been a little while since I watched it, but I\nremember Cooked on Netflix (Michael Pollan) being really good, too! Not really\na cooking show, but an appreciation of general methods we use to prepare\nfood.Expand full commentLikeReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 reply by Mister Branzino\n\nCory CheckettsWeakened DadApr 30I've tried to watch Bourdain's shows but I\ncan't get into them like I used to.
