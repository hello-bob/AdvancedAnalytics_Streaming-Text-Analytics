Do you have anything that you would like to order?\u201d\n\nThanks for reading Ron\u2019s Log! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and\nsupport my work.\n\nMe: \u201cWell, actually it\u2019s funny you say that, because no matter which choice I\nmake \u2014 whether I pick a Whopper or a Big Mac \u2014 it will have been determined by\nthe past. You see, according to Sapolsky\u2019s latest book, Determined, everything\nwe do is dictated by a causal chain. Basically all the things that happen in\nthe present moment is an inevitable result of everything that came before.\nThis is called determinism.\u201d\n\nCashier: \u201cAgain, this is a Wendy\u2019s, we don\u2019t have a whopper or \u2014\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cSapolsky uses the arguments of his previous book, Behave, to elaborate on\nthis point. In the seconds before I make any decision, my choice is determined\nby the synapses in my head. In the minutes before, it\u2019s determined by the\nhormones coursing through my body. In the hours and days and weeks before,\nit\u2019s determined by the various bodily processes and life circumstances I\nundergo, such as a fight I might\u2019ve had with my girlfriend, or the stress of a\nnew job.\u201d\n\nCashier: \u201cI doubt you have a girlfriend, or a job. Maybe I can put you down\nfor a baconator?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cOur fetal development, our DNA, and the evolution of our species all\ninfluence the decisions that we make in the current moment. And most\nimportantly, all of these timescales are happening simultaneously.\u201d\n\nCashier: \u201cYou realize I\u2019m going to spit into your food right? But whatever,\nI\u2019ll bite. I agree with you that things cause other things, but surely there\nare some points in the causal chain that we have control over, right?\u201d\n\nMe, very clearly holding up the line, causing the baby boomer behind me to get\nhypoglycaemia: \u201cWell not really. If you examine anything that happens, the\ndecisions we make can ultimately be traced back to something outside of our\ncontrol. You\u2019re mistaking free will for voluntary action. Just because you\ndon\u2019t have a gun to your head doesn\u2019t mean you have free will.\u201d\n\nCashier: \u201cI would rather have a gun to my head right now \u2014 but what about\nfortitude? What about gumption? Don\u2019t we see evidence of people making good\ndecisions all the time?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cYeah, but this is just a function of a properly functioning dorsolateral\nprefrontal cortex. You see, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is a brain\nregion where \u2014\u201c\n\nCashier: \u201cI know what a dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is. I have a PhD in\nneuroscience. Fine, even if there isn\u2019t free will from any point within the\ncausal chain, can\u2019t free will be an emergent property of the causal chain, the\nsame way consciousness emerges?\u201d\n\nMe, confused: \u201cWait, you know about complexity and emergence?\u201c\n\nCashier: \u201cYes, I have a masters in physics.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cWait, you have a PhD in neuroscience and a masters physics? Why do you\nwork at a Wendy\u2019s?\u201d\n\nCashier: \u201cFor the same reason you\u2019re trying to explain free will to me; this\nis a completely contrived scenario in order to summarize Robert Sapolsky\u2019s\nbook in an interesting manner. Wouldn\u2019t free will be an emergent property?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cMaybe \u2014 in all the places that we might find free will, it\u2019s probably\nthrough emergence. Still, complexity and emergence just shows us how small\nthings end up becoming big things. For example, physics gives rise to\nchemistry, which gives rise to biology, which gives rise to evolution and\nlife, which allows for more abstract concepts like culture and incentive\nstructures. Just because things look fancy in a macro state doesn\u2019t mean that\nthere\u2019s any downward causality. John Conway\u2019s game of life is the perfect\nexample of this. You can see these fascinating structures emerge with time,\nbut any individual square is just following a set of basic commands.\u201d\n\nCashier: \u201cSo if everything is just an application of physics, how come we\ncan\u2019t just plug in the particles into some mathematical equation and predict\nthe future?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cBecause complex processes are fundamentally chaotic, hence making them\nunpredictable. A three body problem and what not. It\u2019s only through\nexperiencing them in a step wise fashion that we actually understand how\nthings unfold. For example, the weather is a complex process. Small changes in\nthe inputs can produce extremely different results in the outputs. That\u2019s why\nwe can only predict a few days in advance, but never years in advance.\u201d\n\nCashier: \u201cExactly \u2014 if life and the people living within it are fundamentally\nunpredictable, doesn\u2019t that make room for free will?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cNo, just because something is unpredictable, does not mean that it\u2019s\nundetermined. If you rewind the tape of the world and play it back, it unfolds\nin the same way, just like Conway\u2019s game of life. The only assumption we need\nto make is the same set of initial conditions.\u201c\n\nThe baby boomer standing just behind me in line: \u201cSir, please order your food\nor I swear to God I\u2019m going to buy another house for $300,000 above asking\nprice.\u201c\n\nMe, not caring because I\u2019m already too broke to afford a house: \u201cThe simple\ntruth of the matter is, the longer you look, the more you realize free will is\nan illusion.\u201d\n\nThe cashier: \u201cWhat about quantum indeterminacy? Subatomic particles can be in\nsuperposition right?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cHow the hell do you know about \u2014 oh right, the masters in physics. That\u2019s\nright, things can be in superposition, where a sub atomic particle can occupy\nmultiple states simultaneously. And for this reason, what I said before isn\u2019t\nentirely correct. The universe is not like a movie. If we pressed rewind and\nthen hit play again, our world probably wouldn\u2019t play out the exact same way.\nBut again, just because you have indeterminacy, that doesn\u2019t sneak in any free\nwill. Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat might be dead and alive simultaneously, but in neither\nscenario did the cat actually choose its fate.\u201d\n\nThe baby boomer, revealing himself to be Hulk Hogan: \u201cYou\u2019ve been holding up\nthis line for too long, brother.\u201d\n\n*He hits me with a stone cold stunner or whatever his signature move is, idk I don\u2019t watch wrestling. Everybody at the Wendy\u2019s claps, and the scene comes to an end.*\n\n##\n\nPart 2: The quantum superposition of our nostrils\n\nContrary to popular sentiment, I occasionally slither out from the rock in\nwhich I was born under and have conversations with people in meat space. I\ncall it \u201cPodcasting IRL\u201d. Considering the subject of free will has been on my\nmind for the last little while, I have been shoehorning it into every\nconversation.\n\nI find that people basically have two reactions to the idea that we have no\nfree will, depending on the type of community that I\u2019m interacting with.\n\n  * The general public: \u201cOf course we have free will. Look, I am [PERFORMING SOME BASIC BODILY ACTION WITHOUT COERCION, LIKE RAISING AN ARM]. I did that of my own free will. What are you, stupid?\u201d\n\n  * The rationalist community: \u201cOf course we don\u2019t have free will. You needed to read a book in order to tell you that? You didn\u2019t derive a Laplacian demon from first principles? What are you, stupid?\u201c\n\nThe vast majority of free will proponents reason it exists based on their\nintuitions. They either refuse to acknowledge it an illusion \u2014 or, more\ndisconcertingly, they believe when the illusion becomes strong enough, it\nceases to be an illusion at all.\n\nIt brings to mind one of the older slatestarcodex posts that was recently\nrecirculated, regarding the various developmental milestones that people go\nthrough. I\u2019m beginning to think that an unsettling amount of the population\nsimply cannot acknowledge a convincing illusion as an illusion.\n\nTake the dress, for example. You\u2019ve already seen it. Black and blue versus\nwhite and gold, blah blah blah.\n\nI\u2019ve only ever seen white and gold, although I\u2019m told the actual dress is\nblack and blue; nevertheless, even after hearing this information, it doesn\u2019t\nchange how I perceive the picture: to my eyes it\u2019s still white and gold.\n\nYet this doesn\u2019t put me into an existential panic; I don\u2019t need to explain how\nthe whiteness and goldness is such a convincing illusion that it\u2019s actually\nthe truth.\n\nThis is essentially how proponents of free will argue that it exists. The most\nnotable proponent is Dan Dennett, who uses masters degree arguments to come to\na middle school conclusion.\n\nBy analogy: if we close one eye, we can see our nose in front of our face. If\nwe close the other eye, the nose shifts slightly. Open both eyes, and our nose\nessentially disappears. Now, the very obvious conclusion is that our eyes\nsimply filter our nose out from our visual system.\n\nBut there might be some academic intellectual out there \u2014 we\u2019ll call him Ban\nBennett \u2014 who might give an alternative explanation as to why we no longer see\nour nose:\n\n\u201cWe know that, at the subatomic level, particles can be in multiple states\nsimultaneously \u2014 superposition. It\u2019s clear that when we have both eyes open,\nour nose is actually in a superposition of being there and not there. That\u2019s\nwhy we do not see our nose, but can still touch it, use it to smell, etc.\u201d\n\nObviously this sort of logic is absurd, because we are using the wrong level\nof description \u2014 using quantum states to explain macro behavior. And yet this\nis how Dennett argues for free will:\n\n\u201cWe are shaped by evolution, and evolution gave us a prefrontal cortex, and\nbecause of that prefrontal cortex we make good decisions, thus free will\narises.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m being snarky, but it\u2019s not really a strawman of his arguments. If you\ndisagree, here is a debate between Sapolsky and Dennett where you can hear his\narguments in his own words.\n\nDespite the Snark, I truly do understand why there\u2019s a strong negative\nsentiment against the illusory nature of free will; to acknowledge that we\nhave no free will societal implications, such as...\n\n##\n\nPart 3: Free Will Hunting, or why it\u2019s not your fault\n\nIf there is no free will, we have to acknowledge that anything that happens at\na particular point in time is inevitable given all of the things that happened\nprior to it across different times scales. And this fact effectively abolishes\nany notion of moral superiority or inferiority; concepts such as \u201cdeserving\u201d\nan outcome, good or bad, essentially go out the window.\n\nIn order to truly accept this, we become Matt Damon\u2019s character in this iconic\n\u201cit\u2019s not your fault\u201d scene.\n\nTaken in the abstract, we can make such a concession; in practice it violates\nthe intuition of our psychology to an extreme degree. To illustrate the point,\nlet\u2019s take three scenarios.\n\n  * A) The case of Mary the elephant. In the early 1900s, Mary was put on trial for killing multiple spectators during a circus performance. Like, she had a lawyer and everything. Ultimately she was sentenced to hanging in front of spectators.\n\n  * B) Charles Whitman, the famous tower shooter who killed over 30 people before committing suicide. When his brain was autopsied, they found a tumour pressing against his amygdala, the part of the brain responsible for hyper aggression.\n\n  * C) A hypothetical scenario, where, instead of simply shooting his victims, Whitman might have sexually assaulted them.\n\nIn scenario a) we can readily acknowledge the barbarism and absurdity of the\nsituation. In fact we might be angry at everybody except for the elephant.\n\nIn scenario b) we might look at Whitman\u2019s case as tragic; I would estimate\nthat around 80% of people might see the tumour as exculpatory, while the\nremaining 20% still might feel as though he still could\u2019ve acted differently \u2014\nthat, at the very least, he might have killed him himself preemptively instead\nof going on his terrible killing spree.\n\nIn scenario c) I would estimate that percentage of people who would look at\nthe tumour as an exculpatory would go down to about 30\u201440%, due to the nature\nof the crime.\n\nTo accept that we have no free will is to accept that all three scenarios are\nexactly the same in that the actions were inevitable, given the inputs \u2014 and\nthat is what makes it extremely unpalatable.\n\n\u201cSo, what? You\u2019re saying that we should let murderers go free?\u201d\n\nOf course not \u2014 given what has already happened, they need to be regarded as\ndefective machines. And in many cases, we can reasonably assure be assured\nthat these machines will never re-integrate into society in any meaningful\nway, and therefore require stringent separation.\n\nBut the idea of \u201ctit for tat\u201d punishment goes out the window; the need for\nretribution in any scenario becomes just as absurd as desiring retribution\nagainst Mary the elephant.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s an extremely tough pill to swallow; it violates my own psychology.\nIn this scenario I\u2019m the one looking at the dress, refusing to believe that\nit\u2019s actually black and blue.\n\nAnd then there is the other side of the coin: we are no longer free to provide\nany moral attribution to those who succeeded. Once more, given the confluence\nof events which happened prior to it \u2014 events which, as we\u2019ve already\nestablished, leave no room for free will \u2014 the successes of the present become\ninevitable.\n\nThe people in life who have achieved success have no doubt put in tremendous\namounts of hard work and gumption, but these attributes ultimately stemmed\nfrom things which we had no control over. And once more this is extremely\nunpalatable.\n\n\u201cSo, what, you want neurosurgeons and CEOs to make the same amount of money as\nminimum wage workers? You\u2019re saying that we should just be a communist\nutopia?\u201c\n\nAgain, no. Status games are perfectly fine, just as long as the main driver of\nthese status games is to incentivize and disincentivize behavior. And yet the\nconcept of \u201cdeserve\u201d \u2014 at some grand cosmic level \u2014 becomes utterly\nmeaningless.\n\nAgain, I suspect nobody will actually have their minds changed on these\npoints. Those who intuitively agree with my conclusion will be frustrated that\nI made the arguments this way instead of that way \u2014 that I'm just badly\nregurgitating something they heard in a Sam Harris podcast; those who disagree\naccuse me of being some sort of criminal apologist/communist.\n\nWhich brings us to...\n\n##\n\nPart 4: Speculations and Conclusion\n\nPersonally I don\u2019t think the question of free will is going to be definitively\nproven one way or another any time soon. Or if it is, it will be solved as a\nbyproduct of solving the problem of consciousness, as well as the nature of\nthe self. For reasons that go beyond the scope of this post, I believe that\nall three issues are effectively the same.\n\nNevertheless, in having these conversations, I find that pretty much everyone\nhas an intuition about whether free will exists; and so it would be\ninteresting to conduct further studies about who intuitively believers vs\nskeptics.\n\nFor example, based on my own nonrepresentative experiences and discussions, I\nhave found that that:\n\n  1. STEM majors are more intuitively inclined to believe free will is just an illusion, as opposed to humanities majors. I suspect this is because STEM majors tend to be more deconstructionist in their mindset. Once they understand the concept of a Laplacian demon and emergence they tend to be on board.\n\n  2. Men tend to be more extreme in their views regarding free will. I think this comes from two competing mindsets; the first is already elaborated in the first point, as men tend to be disproportionately represented in STEM. The second is the fact that men tend to be more in favor of Ayn Randian style libertarians.\n\n  3. Non-religious people tend to reject free will at greater rates than religious people. Again, this is something that I don\u2019t really have a lot of data for, considering I don\u2019t tend to interact with highly religious people on a regular basis. Nevertheless, my hypothesis is that it\u2019s hard to believe that you have the ability to choose whether you get into heaven or hell if it\u2019s already determined from the outside.\n\n  4. Liberals tend to reject free will at greater rates than conservatives. I think this is just a hybrid of points 2) and 3); additionally, people with a more left-leaning ideology tend to be systems level thinkers where they can recognize the impact of overarching incentive structures beyond any person\u2019s control (critical theories, patriarchy, blah blah blah). And yet I admit this clashes with point 1) as humanities majors tend to also have a systems level mindset, where they attempt to place people and events in context of greater models rather than deconstructing them.\n\nAll this is to say that more studies on the subject would be interesting.\n\nHope you learned something. And if you didn\u2019t, it\u2019s not your fault. Or mine,\nfor that matter.\n\n##\n\n\u201cWait, are you going to explain the whole nudists versus Buddhists thing in\nthe title?\u201d\n\nOh, right.\n\nThe original comment comes from within Sapolsky\u2019s book. I thought it was\nfunny, and in the original iterations of this post, the socratic dialogue at\nWendy's was actually going to take place between a nudist and a Buddhist. But,\nyou know, revisions and stuff.\n\nAnyways, here\u2019s some more picture of quantum nostrils.\n\nThanks for reading Ron\u2019s Log!

You can say a concept, say a 'hammer', exists, in that\nit's a thingy, a bunch of atoms in a certain place that are very real, and\nthat's fine. But all concepts and words are used because they are useful in\nsome way, if they're not useful then they probably wouldn't be used :)I agree\nthat free will in the sense of physical determinism, or even an emergent\nphenomenon take makes us free from determinism, is likely false. I think\nindeterminism in physics even makes the case weaker! I think it's very\nimportant to understand this, for the reasons you mentioned, so that we can\nimprove as a society when its concerned: in the sense of being more open to\nforgiveness, in being less punitive and vengeful, and trying our best to\nrehabilitate people, when at all possible; in a way showing that punishment\nand revenge simply to fulfill a metaphysical justice is misguided, and we will\njust create more injustice.That said, I can there *can* be a useful definition\nof 'free will' (that is, the concept exists insofar as there's a useful\ndefinition), and in a way that's more or less satisfying (and it's probably\nimportant to distinguish from the former defintion). And it's the exact\nopposite of historical intuition, I believe! I believe *the more determined*,\nin a very specific way I'll explain, you are, the more freedom (and perhaps\nfree will) you have. Think about it: if all your actions are completely random\n(and your mental processes are random too, if it helps) -- whether this\nrandomness is some kind of 'true' physical randomness, or simply chaos, then\nit seems we should agree you have 0 freedom or free will. I say actions but\nthey're just a reflection of mental processes, and the freedom of your actions\nwill reflect the freedom of your mental processes (you can probably define\nboth action-freedom and thought-freedom as separate useful concepts). Say you\nhave non-functioning mental processes, that lead you to either be unable to\nmove at all, or make very simple repetitive movements; obviously no freedom as\nwell. Finally, say you have non-functioning mental processes, but you have\njust enough function to be able to always do as you are told. Then you don't\nhave free-will. But if your thought process works correctly, and you *reason*\nabout the past in order to choose good actions for the future (hopefully even\nin universal ways, approaching the nature of ethics, etc.), then it would seem\nfair to define you do have freedom, and free-will. The concept can only exist\nas a definition of *the more* you reason, think, reflect, etc.. the more free\nyou are. And I think an useful extension is that this reason should itself be\nused for good in general (or at the very least for your own good); because if\nyou act against yourself consistently, or say act only in the interests of a\nmaster, then it seems also senseless to assume you have freedom or free-\nwill.This seems very useful: you want more free will? Learn to reason more\neffectively, better, and with better ethical judgement.It also aligns with\nsome intuitive expectations about the concept. Intuitively, we expect that if\nwe just 'stop doing stuff', or 'decide not to do anything', then nothing will\nhappen, which is correct. Although we are determined, we nonetheless shouldn't\nchoose not to do anything (in the expectation that everything will happen the\nsame regardless), and it's not true that we *can't* choose not to do anything:\nsome people in fact choose to do nothing with disastrous consequences, so when\nspeaking of humans categorically it's possible. Our communication and our\nthoughts do determine our future thoughts, so it's best, and in a sense\ncorrect, to think that we should choose to act (see how choice is not at all\ninconsistent with determinism). You should make good choices. You are\nresponsible for those choices in the sense that your own mind is probably the\nbiggest contributing factor to the choices your person will make in the\nfuture, as well as your own wellbeing (through its own thinking). Basically\nyou should make good choices, and you can study for that, talk with others,\netc.. This we already knew of course :)I think this makes me into a\ncompatibilist?Expand full commentLikeReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n2 more comments...\n\nNo Balconies in Vegas, Or How to Deal with Being a Low Status Individual\n\nAlternate Title: Why Steven Pinker is correct, but Annoying\n\nDec 25, 2023 \u2022\n\nRon Ghosh\n\n13\n\nShare this post\n\n#### No Balconies in Vegas, Or How to Deal with Being a Low Status Individual\n\nronghosh.substack.com\n\n1\n\nBallin' Alone: A Rationalist Guide To Our Age Of Loneliness\n\nAlternate Title: The Ice(olation) Age\n\nFeb 14 \u2022\n\nRon Ghosh\n\n16\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Ballin' Alone: A Rationalist Guide To Our Age Of Loneliness\n\nronghosh.substack.com\n\n5\n\nReasons to Keep Living\n\nWithout resorting to delusion or toxic positivity\n\nAug 23, 2023 \u2022\n\nRon Ghosh\n\n13\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Reasons to Keep Living\n\nronghosh.substack.com\n\n2\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Ron Ghosh\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
