Such a software suite was previously made\npopular by Netscape and Mozilla, and the SeaMonkey project continues to\ndevelop and deliver high-quality updates to this concept. Containing an\nInternet browser, email & newsgroup client with an included web feed reader,\nHTML editor, IRC chat and web development tools, SeaMonkey is sure to appeal\nto advanced users, web developers and corporate users.\n\nUnder the hood, SeaMonkey uses much of the same Mozilla Firefox source code\nwhich powers such products as Thunderbird. Legal backing is provided by the\nSeaMonkey Association (SeaMonkey e.V.).\n\n##\n\nProject News\n\n#### March 28, 2024\n\nSeaMonkey 2.53.18.2 released\n\nThe SeaMonkey project is proud to present SeaMonkey 2.53.18.2: The new release\nof the all-in-one Internet suite is available for free download now!\n\n2.53.18.2 is a minor bugfix release on the 2.53.x branch and contains a crash\nfix and a few other fixes to the application from the underlying platform\ncode.\n\nSeaMonkey 2.53.18.2 is available in 23 languages, for Windows, macOS x64 and\nLinux.\n\nAutomatic upgrades from previous 2.53.x versions are enabled for this release,\nbut if you have problems with it please download the full installer from the\ndownloads section and install SeaMonkey 2.53.18.2 manually over the previous\nversion.\n\nFor a more complete list of major changes in SeaMonkey 2.53.18.2, see the\nWhat's New in SeaMonkey 2.53.18.2 section of the Release Notes, which also\ncontains a list of known issues and answers to frequently asked questions.

The current SeaMonkey release crashes during startup\nafter upgrading to macOS 13 Ventura. Until we have a fix we advise you not to\nupgrade your macOS installation to Ventura. No usable crash information is\ngenerated and this might take a bit longer than usual to fix. This is not a\nproblem with Monterey 12.6.1 or any lower supported macOS version so might\neven be an Apple bug.\n\nThe problem is tracked in Bug 1797696.\n\n## The SeaMonkey Internet Application Suite\n\nSeaMonkey has inherited the successful all-in-one concept of the original\nNetscape Communicator and continues that product line based on the modern,\ncross-platform architecture provided by the Mozilla project.\n\n  * The Internet browser at the core of the SeaMonkey Internet Application Suite uses the same rendering engine and application platform as Mozilla Firefox, with popular features like tabbed browsing, feed detection, popup blocking, smart location bar, find as you type and a lot of other functionality for a smooth web experience.\n  * SeaMonkey's Mail and Newsgroups client shares lots of code with Thunderbird and features adaptive Junk mail filtering, tags and mail views, web feeds reading, tabbed messaging, multiple accounts, S/MIME, address books with LDAP support and is ready for both private and corporate use.\n  * Additional components include an easy-to-use HTML Editor, the ChatZilla IRC chat application and web development tools like a DOM Inspector.\n  * If that's still not enough, SeaMonkey can be extended with numerous Add-Ons that provide additional functionality and customization for a complete Internet experience.\n\n  * Site Map\n  * Security Updates\n  * About SeaMonkey\n  * Contact Us\n\nSeaMonkey and the SeaMonkey logo are registered trademarks of the SeaMonkey\nAssociation (SeaMonkey e.V.).\n\nPortions of this content are \u00a9 1998\u20132024 by individual mozilla.org contributors; content available under a Creative Commons license | Details.\n\n  * Last modified March 27, 2024\n  * Document History\n\n", "frontpage": true}
