So, covering multiple domains becomes easier. So, we will see two\nmain branches of developers:\n\n1\\. Product-Minded Full-Stack Developers - or Centaurs in short: They are the\nones writing requirements in AI chat prompts. The generalists from today need\nto be even more general in the future. Equipped with a vast range of technical\nknowledge, they are responsible for bridging tech and product.\n\n2\\. Specialized Experts: They are the sole ones who write novel code and\nhandle tasks that AI has yet to master, including building AI systems and\nprogramming languages. They are the spearheads of their respective programming\necosystems. (However, with AI\u2019s exponential learning curve, even these roles\nare not immune to obsolescence.)\n\nIt is safe to assume that in 90% of the product teams, smaller full-stack\nteams will outperform larger teams with experts.\n\nFor technical leaders, it is paramount to coach developers to become broad,\nproduct-minded, and full-stack (including DevOps!).\n\n## Team Topologies: Smaller Teams - Loosely coupled, highly aligned \u00b6\n\nGiven a centaur programmer\u2019s effectiveness, ensuring they do not waste time\ndiscussing things in Jira Tickets with their own or other teams will be\nessential.\n\n(Lines Of Communication and Team Size: Applying Brooks\u2019 Law)\n\nThe smaller the team, the less communication. This fact boosts productivity\neven more (besides the fact that much of the code is now AI-generated).\n\nSo, smaller teams are a good thing. I predict we go down from a typical team\nsize of 5-7 developers to 2-3 developers. A solo developer is undoubtedly\npossible, but some redundancy is essential for resiliency.\n\nTherefore, the two most essential principles for team topologies apply:\n\n  1. Loosely coupled: A team can operate independently because there are minimal dependencies on other teams.\n  2. Highly aligned: One team\u2019s goals are strategically aligned with the goals of other teams by the product strategy.\n\nNone of this is new, but it is ever more crucial in smaller teams with high\noutput. Technical leaders need to consider this in macro architecture.\n\n  * Published On: 2024-05-06\n  * Found a typo?
