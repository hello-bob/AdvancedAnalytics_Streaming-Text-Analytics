Writing in\nhis latest Power On newsletter, Gurman reports a marked decline in the demand\nfor retail demos and sales, based on the Apple Stores he has spoken to:\n\n> Demand for demos is way down. People who do book appointments often don't\n> show up, and sales \u2014 at least at some locations \u2014 have gone from a couple of\n> units a day to just a handful in a whole week. Apple also has had to step up\n> the marketing on its online homepage. There's a huge promo for the Vision\n> Pro at the top of the website \u2014 the most aggressive pitch since the device\n> went on sale in early February.\n\nThe trend that Apple Vision Pro appears to be following is less likely to be a\nretail anomaly, and more indicative of a broader issue that has plagued VR\ntechnology from its inception: Maintaining user engagement after the initial\nnovelty wears off.\n\nGurman offers his personal experience of Apple's headset as a microcosm of\nwhat he suspects is a wider user trend. His own usage has decreased from daily\ninteractions to just once or twice a week. A significant barrier to more\nfrequent use, he says, is a setup that involves attaching batteries, booting\nup, and navigating a complex interface, which makes traditional devices like\nlaptops and smartphones more appealing for regular tasks.\n\nGurman also blames the Vision Pro's lack of a \"killer app\" and compelling\ncontent for further diminishing the headset's appeal. He notes that it feels\nbetter suited to solitary activities \u2013 say, on a long flight or while working\nfrom home \u2013 rather than for use in social situations or around co-workers.\n\nIt seems Apple still has a considerable task ahead in evolving the Vision Pro\ninto a device that redefines everyday technology use. In the meantime, several\nbugs that initially plagued visionOS have been resolved, although many of\nApple's own apps are still not optimized for the device's operating system.\n\nIn the last visionOS update, Apple added Spatial Personas, which make it feel\nlike you are in the same virtual room as another Vision Pro user. Spatial\nPersonas can be used for watching movies and TV shows together, FaceTime and\nother video calls, using apps like Freeform, playing games, and more. However,\nthe feature needs other Vision Pro owners to appreciate it, and as Gurman\nnotes, they are still few and far between.\n\nApple is expected to produce fewer than 400,000 Vision Pro headsets in 2024\ndue to the complexity of manufacturing, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\nHowever, Apple is said to be already working on a new version of the Apple\nVision Pro for 2025 that will be priced more affordably. Meanwhile, the first\nincarnation of the headset is expected to arrive in additional countries later\nthis year.\n\nRelated Roundup: Apple Vision Pro\n\nTag: Mark Gurman\n\nBuyer's Guide: Vision Pro (Buy Now)\n\nRelated Forum: Apple Vision Pro\n\n[ 100 comments ]\n\n## Top Rated Comments\n\ntruthsteve\n\n3 hours ago at 02:14 am\n\noh really because I thought consumer interest would go up\n\nScore: 16 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nrobvalentine\n\n3 hours ago at 02:22 am\n\nToo niche and expensive.\n\nScore: 13 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nand 1989 others\n\n3 hours ago at 02:14 am\n\nIts price point is too high for most consumers.

It\u2019s not like a pair of glasses for those with poor eyesight or a\nwrist watch for telling time or a \u201csmart phone\u201d for a million things we used\nto use other less versatile devices to accomplish.\n\nWithout that feeling of \u201cI just can\u2019t imagine working on this one thing or\nnavigating something or other without my Vision Pro\u201d and without a sub 1K\nprice or amazing and easy to access financing option there\u2019s just no way this\nor any similar product will take off.\n\nScore: 11 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nlenningj\n\n3 hours ago at 02:32 am\n\nIt doesn't replace any existing devices I have already.
