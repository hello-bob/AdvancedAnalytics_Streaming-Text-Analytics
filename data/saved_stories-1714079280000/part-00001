Shortly thereafter, the prior year\u2019s winner, John\nRahm, placed the green jacket on Scheffler\u2019s broad shoulders cementing\nScheffler at the top of the world rankings.\n\nAs I watched the ceremony unfold, it reminded me of something Scott Van Pelt\nsaid last spring when he was discussing Scheffler and Rahm\u2019s respective paths\nto the top of the sport. Given they had nearly identical scoring averages\n(~68.6), I figured their paths were very similar. I could not have been more\nwrong.\n\nSee, Rahm\u2019s ascent had come from \u201crisk-seeking\u201d, as evidenced by the fact that\nhe was averaging more than 5.5 birdies per round through the middle of last\nseason and was on pace to become the first PGA player to do so since 2000.\n\nMeanwhile, Scheffler\u2019s success had come from \u201crisk-mitigation\u201d, as evidenced\nby the fact that he had made a bogey (or worse) on fewer than 10% of the holes\nhe had played. Coincidentally, he was also on pace to do something that hadn\u2019t\nbeen done since 2000.\n\nFor all you golfers out there, this should be encouraging because it means\nsuccess can come in multiple forms, so long as you are disciplined enough to\nstick to what best suits your game. The trouble is few are willing and/or able\nto do so. Instead, the vast majority of golfers endlessly pivot.\n\nOn one hole they choose to be aggressive and attempt to hit a par-5 in two,\nonly to lay up on the next one. They hit aggressive putts on some holes, then\nlag putts on others. They play it safe and pitch out from behind trees on the\nfront nine, only to attempt aggressive draws around them on the back.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause they let their emotions get the best of them.\n\nThis is just the start.\n\nGolfers often change their approaches mid-hole, mid-round, mid-season, and\nsometimes even mid-swing. It\u2019s unquestionably manic. Yet, golfer behavior\npales in comparison to investor behavior.\n\nInvestors are notoriously mercurial. We chase performance, buy high, sell low,\nand endlessly pursue fads. Bull markets convince us that we are brilliant,\nwhen in reality we are often just pawns in another wealth destroying bubble.\nBear markets, on the other hand, force us to do things we had previously\nconvinced ourselves we would never do (namely selling at the lows and stop\ncommitting to private investments).\n\nThis is precisely the reason why nearly every equity fund\u2019s dollar-weighted\nreturns are significantly worse than their time-weighted returns and why\nprivate equity vintage performance is inversely correlated to the amount of\ncapital that funds have raised (i.e., the worst vintages typically come during\nbuoyant fundraising periods). This behavior has been on full display over the\npast decade-and-a-half.\n\nLike Jordan Spieth\u2019s play in the years after he blew a five shot lead in the\nfinal round of the 2016 Masters, investors became incredibly risk averse in\nthe wake of the 2007-2009 great financial crisis (\u201cGFC\u201d) after suffering\nextreme losses. This meant a strong aversion to riskier asset classes like\nhigh growth tech stocks and venture capital. However, as is almost always the\ncase, this aversion waned over time as both started to post strong returns and\nanimal spirits slowly returned.\n\nAs the GFC fell further into the rearview mirror, investors began shifting\ninto risk-seeking mode and ratcheted up their exposures to these riskier\nassets, especially with bond yields so low. It started with modest commitments\nto venture and tech, but quickly ramped up towards the end of the decade.\n\nFor a while, things felt good. Check that, things felt great as the highest\ngrowth parts of the market posted eye-popping returns. After all, who doesn\u2019t\nlove the feeling of hitting shots like Phil Mickelson from behind the tree on\nthe 13th at the 2010 Masters or Bubba Watson in a playoff at the 2012 Masters?\n\nThe trouble is, unlike Mickelson and Watson who rarely waver from their risk-\non approaches, in 2022 when the NASDAQ fell 40% and venture seized up in the\nwake of Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s failure amid higher rates, investors once again\nretreated into risk-mitigating mode by failing to add to beaten down tech\ncompanies and cutting back on new venture commitments.\n\nWhen the markets then rallied unexpectedly in 2023 on the heels of the hype\naround AI and the prospect for lower rates, investors were once again left\nchasing.\n\nSo where does this leave us today?\n\nInvestors are once again in risk-seeking mode as evidenced by the fact that\nindividual investors are the most bullish they\u2019ve been since the fall of 2021,\nthe NASDAQ is once again taking in record flows, and investor confidence is so\nhigh that buying protection against a 5% dip in the next year has fallen to\nwhat Bank of America strategist Ben Bowler called not too long ago the\n\u201ccheapest you likely have ever seen\u201d. All at a time when the markets look very\nexpensive.\n\nThe question is, why do investors continually behave like this?\n\nSimply because it is in our nature.\n\nAs Charlie Munger said,\n\n\u201cA lot of people with high IQs aren\u2019t great investors because they have\nterrible temperaments. That is why having a certain kind of temperament is\nmore important than brains. You need to keep raw irrational emotion under\ncontrol. You need patience and discipline and an ability to take losses and\nadversity without going crazy. You need an ability to not be driven crazy by\nextreme success.\u201d\n\nThis quote was top of mind when someone recently asked me whether I thought we\nshould materially dial back risk for an institution I serve on the investment\ncommittee for. Earlier in my career, I likely would have responded that we\nabsolutely should dial risk back given the current state of valuations, cheap\ncost to protect via options, extreme confidence, and looser credit conditions.\nHowever, the longer I do this, the more I realize the answer is significantly\nmore nuanced.\n\nThe fact is I have no idea where markets are headed or whether there is a\ngreater chance markets will crash or compound at reasonable rates of return\nover the next few years. No one does.\n\nThat said, how did I respond?\n\nI simply said that I thought we should stick to our process.\n\nNow, since this particular institution is conservative in nature, has\nsignificant outstanding obligations over the next few years, and no meaningful\npending inflows of new capital, this meant that yes, we likely should be more\ndefensive and dial back our risk (the same could be said for a 70-year old\nretiree with no incoming cash flows or someone looking to retire in the next\nfew years).\n\nHowever, if this institution had a more \u201crisk on\u201d nature, few (if any) future\nfixed obligations, and a reliable stream of capital inflows, I would likely\nhave said that it did not make as much sense to significantly dial back risk \u2014\nnamely to skip venture capital commitments, rush out of equities into bonds,\netc. (the same could be said for a person early or in the prime of their\ncareers with decades left to work and generate income). The reason is simply\nbecause doing so would mean straying from its process, timing the market, and\nmaybe most importantly, forcing a future decision on when to switch back into\nrisk-seeking mode...something few can do effectively.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the bottom line?\n\nInvesting is hard, but it doesn\u2019t need to be as hard as people make it. As\nJohn Rahm and Scottie Scheffler illustrate, success can come in very different\nforms, so long as you consistently adhere to your process.\n\nRisk-seeking and risk-mitigating can both be successful strategies, so long as\nyou are disciplined enough to stick to them. So today, while the market feels\na bit frothy, inflation remains stubbornly high, and the risk to the downside\nfeels greater than the potential to the upside, history has shown that trying\nto materially adjust your approach to fit the current environment as opposed\nto your unique circumstances doesn\u2019t typically work out well. Only the very\nelite (or lucky) investors have shown an ability to toggle between risk-\nseeking and risk-mitigating.\n\nNow before you go thinking you might be elite, remember when I said earlier\nthat both Rahm\u2019s 5.5 birdies per round and Scheffler\u2019s <10% bogey threshold\nwere coincidentally last accomplished in 2000? Care to guess which golfers\naccomplished those thresholds close to two-and-a-half decades ago?\n\nWell, what if I told you it wasn\u2019t multiple golfers?\n\nWhat if I told you it was just one?\n\nTiger Woods.\n\nSo, unless you are the investing equivalent of the greatest golfer of all-\ntime, it probably makes sense to stick to one or the other.\n\nSHARE\n\n  * Copy Link\n\n### Sign up for more Collab Fund content\n\n## More from the blog...\n\n### Find the Savages\n\nby Ted Lamade \u2014 Mar 28, 2024\n\nWe are inundated these days with headlines about how our college system is\nbroken and how despondent graduates are due...\n\n### The Thin Line\n\nby Ted Lamade \u2014 Jan 31, 2024\n\nDuring my final semester of graduate school I took a class titled, \u201cLeadership\nRide: Lessons from Gettysburg\u201d.\n\n### How Many Santas\n\nby Ted Lamade \u2014 Dec 18, 2023\n\nAs anyone who has ever been to New York City around Christmas knows, there is\nno better place this time...\n\n# Collab Fund\n\nCollaborative is a leading source of capital for big ideas pushing the world\nforward.\n\n## Newsletter\n\nSign up for updates \u2197\n\n## Twitter\n\nFollow @collabfund \u2197\n\n## RSS\n\nSubscribe to the blog \u2197\n\nCollaborative Fund Management LLC, Collaborative Holdings Management LP and\nCollab+Currency Management, LLC are distinct investment advisory entities, are\nnot a unitary enterprise and operate independently of one another.
