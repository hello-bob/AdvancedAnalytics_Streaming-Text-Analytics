You can also test your slide designing skills using\n> Wondercheck, our new custom GPT.\n\nIn conducting this research, we have interviewed a group of graphic design\nprofessionals that have collectively taught over 50,000 people how to design\npresentations. The questions we asked them were designed (no pun intended) to\nget a clear picture of the most common mistakes people commit when creating\ntheir presentations, regardless of the software they use or their professional\nbackground.\n\nWe then tried to break each of these mistakes down into separate categories,\ngiving you an in-depth overview of the potential pitfalls you might face\nduring the design process.\n\n## Most common mistakes by type\n\nAccording to the experts we interviewed, here is the breakdown of the most\ncommon mistakes users make when designing slides. They are, in descending\norder:\n\n  1. Text-related mistakes\n  2. Compositional mistakes\n  3. Graphs and tables\n  4. Color-related mistakes (tied with 5)\n  5. Image-related mistakes (tied with 4)\n\nLet\u2019s dive deeper into each category to uncover the specific mistakes users\nmake.\n\n## Text-related mistakes\n\nAs we see here, the most common text-related mistakes are:\n\n  1. Using too much text on the slide\n  2. Using a font size that is too small to be legible\n  3. Overloading the slide with bullet points\n  4. Using outdated fonts\n  5. Using visually conflicting fonts on the same slide\n\n## Compositional mistakes\n\nWhen it comes to compositional mistakes, the most common ones people make are\nas follows:\n\n  1. Sloppy alignment of elements on the slide\n  2. Improper placement of tables or charts\n  3. Improper placement of graphs\n  4. Using too many tables or graphs on the same slide\n\n## Graphs and tables\n\nAs we can see, the most common mistakes when using graphs or tables are:\n\n  1. Using too many colors, especially to highlight various data\n  2. Selecting the wrong kind of graph or table to illustrate and present your data\n  3. Choosing a poorly designed graph or table\n\n## Image-related mistakes\n\nHere are the most common image-related mistakes in descending order:\n\n  1. Using low-quality, low-resolution images\n  2. Having images obstruct important information or data\n  3. Using images that have an outdated style\n\n## Color-related mistakes\n\nColor-related mistakes are somewhat simpler than the other categories, with\nonly a few mistakes realistically possible. However, here they are in\ndescending order:\n\n  1. Using too many colors on one slide\n  2. Using an old-school, outdated gradient color scheme\n\nNow we know the most common mistakes that occur when creating presentations \u2014\nbut what next? First, you can test out your design know-how with Wondercheck \u2013\na new custom GPT we designed based on this very research. It will analyze your\nslide and give you thorough feedback on how you can improve it, and it will\nalso point out any of the mistakes that we discussed above.\n\nBut we\u2019ve still got more to learn. Let us now dive deeper into how we can\npreemptively avoid all the aforementioned mistakes, as well as some best\npractices \u2013 as suggested by our design experts. Armed with this kind of\nknowledge, you\u2019ll be well on your way to leveling up your slides.\n\nDate March 29, 2024\n\nHow it works Pricing Blog Legal\n\nSupport\n\nsupport@wonderslide.com\n\nFollow us to learn about cool design tricks for presentations\n\nUpload draft slides\n\n", "frontpage": false}
