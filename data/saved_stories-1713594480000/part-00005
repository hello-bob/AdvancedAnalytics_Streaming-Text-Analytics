It had been owned by\nLinspire. Inc. from 2001 to 2008, and then by Xandros from 2008 to 2017.\n\nOn July 1, 2008, Linspire stockholders elected to change the company's name to\nDigital Cornerstone,^[2] and all assets were acquired by Xandros.^[3]\n\nOn August 8, 2008, Andreas Typaldos, CEO of Xandros, announced that Linspire\nwould be discontinued in favor of Xandros; Freespire would change its base\ncode from Ubuntu to Debian; and the Linspire brand would cease to exist.^[4]\n\nOn January 1, 2018, it was announced that PC/OpenSystems LLC had purchased\nLinspire and Freespire from Xandros, and that Linspire 7 was available for\n$79.99, while Freespire 3 was available for free.^[5]\n\n## History[edit]\n\nSee also: Microsoft vs. Lindows\n\nBased in San Diego, California, Lindows, Inc. was incorporated in July 2001 by\nMichael Robertson and began selling products in January 2002.^[6] Robertson's\ngoal was to develop a Linux-based operating system capable of running major\nMicrosoft Windows applications. It based its Windows compatibility on the Wine\nAPI. The company later abandoned this approach in favor of attempting to make\nLinux applications easy to download, install and use. To this end a program\nnamed \"CNR\" was developed: based on Debian's Advanced Packaging Tool, it\nprovides an easy-to-use graphical user interface and a slightly modified\npackage system for an annual fee. The first public release of Lindows was\nversion 1.0, released in late 2001.^[7]\n\nIn 2002, Microsoft sued Lindows, Inc. claiming the name Lindows constituted an\ninfringement of their Windows trademark. Microsoft's claims were rejected by\nthe court, which asserted that Microsoft had used the term windows to describe\ngraphical user interfaces before the Windows product was ever released, and\nthat the windowing technique had already been implemented by Xerox and Apple\nComputer many years before.^[8] Microsoft sought a retrial and after this was\npostponed in February 2004,^[9] offered to settle the case. As part of the\nlicensing settlement, Microsoft paid an estimated $20 million, and Lindows,\nInc. transferred the Lindows trademark to Microsoft and changed its name to\nLinspire, Inc.^[10]\n\nOn June 15, 2005, Michael Robertson stepped down as CEO of Linspire, Inc. He\ncontinues as chairman^[citation needed] and was replaced as CEO by Kevin\nCarmony.\n\nLinspire became a member of the Interop Vendor Alliance which was founded in\n2006.^[11]^[12]^[13]^[14]\n\nOn February 8, 2007, Linspire, Inc. and Canonical Ltd, the lead sponsor and\ndeveloper of the Ubuntu operating system, announced plans for a new technology\npartnership, with Linspire aiming to \"begin basing ... [their] desktop Linux\nofferings on Ubuntu.\"^[15]\n\nOn June 13, 2007, Linspire and Microsoft announced an interoperability\ncollaboration agreement with a focus on document format compatibility, instant\nmessaging, digital media, web search, and patent covenants for Linspire\ncustomers.^[16] This agreement was criticised, most notably by the Groklaw\nwebsite^[17] for being disingenuously short-lived and limited, and against the\nspirit of the GNU General Public License. Kevin Carmony, in one of the regular\n\"Linspire Letters,\" asserted that the agreement would \"bring even more choices\nto desktop Linux users [and] ... offer a \"better\" Linux experience.\"^[18]\n\nLinspire bases its product code names on fish found near its headquarters:\nLinspire/LindowsOS 4.5 was code named Coho; Linspire Five-0 (5.0 and 5.1) and\nFreespire 1.0, Marlin; and Freespire 2.0 and Linspire 6.0, Skipjack.\n\n## CNR[edit]\n\nMain article: CNR (software)\n\nLinspire's CNR (originally Click'N'Run) was a software distribution service\nbased on Debian's APT. It was designed to serve as a GUI-based, user-\naccessible means of downloading and installing various applications, both free\nand proprietary. The service allowed users to install available applications\nusing a single click. CNR also included a set of Click and Buy (CNB) software,\nwhich included many commercial applications to members at a discounted rate.\nCNR had over 38,000 different software packages^[citation needed], ranging\nfrom simple applications to major commercial works such as Win4Lin and\nStarOffice.^[19] CNR was originally subscription-based with two tiers: basic\nservice cost $20 annually, and gold, featuring discounts on some commercial\napplications, $50. In 2006, Linspire announced that the basic service was to\nbe made available for free.^[20]\n\nLinspire planned to port CNR to the Ubuntu distribution. The company announced\non April 24, 2006 that CNR would be released under an open source license. The\nrelease of the free CNR client was planned to coincide with the release of\nFreespire 2.0 and Linspire 6.0.^[21] On January 23, 2007, Linspire announced\nthat it intended to provide CNR for other Linux distributions, both APT- and\nRPM-based, including Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE and Ubuntu. This support was\nexpected to appear in mid-2007.^[citation needed] On February 8, 2007,\nLinspire, Inc. announced a partnership with Canonical Ltd., publisher of the\nUbuntu Linux distribution. This deal would see Linspire and Freespire migrate\nfrom the unpredictable Debian release process to the semiannual Ubuntu release\ncycle. It was intended that the main Ubuntu distribution would become the\nfirst recipient of the opening of the Click'N'Run service to Linux\ndistributions besides Linspire.^[15]\n\n## Freespire[edit]\n\nMain article: Freespire\n\nFreespire RC1\n\nIn August 2005, Andrew Betts released Freespire, a Live CD based on\nLinspire.^[22] Some users mistook this for a product from Linspire, Inc.\nLinspire, Inc. offered users a \"free Linspire\" (purchase price discounted to\n$0) by using the coupon code \"Freespire\" until September 9, 2005. On April 24,\n2006, Linspire announced its own project named \"Freespire\".^[23] This followed\nthe model of community-oriented releases by Red Hat and Novell in the form of\nFedora and openSUSE. Freespire was a community-driven and -supported project\ntied to the commercial Linspire distribution, and included previously\nproprietary elements from Linspire, such as the CNR Client, while other\nelements, which Linspire, Inc. licenses but does not own, like the Windows\nMedia Audio compatibility libraries, remain closed-source. Consequently, there\nare two versions of Freespire, one with the closed source libraries, and one,\ncalled Freespire OSS Edition, that includes only open-source components.\n\nFreespire 1.0 was released on August 7, 2006.^[24] Freespire 2.0.8, released\non 30 November 2007,^[25] and based on Ubuntu 7.04, was the final release\nuntil the distribution was revived with 3.0 in January 2018.^[26]\n\n## Contributions[edit]\n\nLinspire, Inc. sponsored open source projects including the Pidgin and Kopete\ninstant messaging clients, the Mozilla Firefox web browser,^[citation needed]\nthe ReiserFS file system, the Nvu WYSIWYG website editor, and the KDE-Apps.org\nand KDE-Look.org websites.^[27] In the past, Linspire has hosted several Linux\nand open source events, such as the annual Desktop Linux Summit, DebConf and\nthe KDE Developers Conference.^[citation needed]\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\nLinspire has drawn some criticism from the free software community. This has\nincluded criticism for including proprietary software, with GNU founder\nRichard Stallman commenting: \"No other GNU/Linux distribution has backslided\nso far away from freedom. Switching from MS Windows to Linspire does not bring\nyou to freedom, it just gets you a different master.\"^[28] In addition,\nfollowing the initial Freespire announcement Pamela Jones of the Groklaw\nwebsite published an article entitled \"Freespire: A Linux Distro For When You\nCouldn't Care Less About Freedom;\" that was highly critical of Linspire, Inc.,\nand the Freespire project, for including closed-source components and\nadvertising them as a favourable point\u2014an action she classed as ignoring free\nand open-source software (FOSS) community values in a \"community-driven\"\ndistribution, asserting that \"Free Software isn't about proprietary drivers\"\nand that \"proprietary codecs, drivers and applications are not Open Source or\nopen in any way.\"^[29] In response, Linspire, Inc. CEO Kevin Carmony stated\nvia a journalist on the Linspire website that in ten years of holding out, the\nFOSS community has made relatively few gains, that many users are already\nusing proprietary software and, although some would hold out, most would\nprefer to have something that works rather than nothing. He also asserted that\nthe company believed in open source software, but also in the freedom of\nindividuals to choose whatever software they want.^[30]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Free and open-source software portal\n\n  * Commercial use of copyleft works\n  * Zorin OS, Linux Mint, MX Linux, free Linux distributions designed to imitate Windows or recommended for longtime Windows users\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"\"Linspire 12 Service Pack 1 Release\"\".\n  2. ^ Brown, Eric (2008-07-01). \"Xandros quietly acquires Linspire\".
