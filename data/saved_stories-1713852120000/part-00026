I suppose they\ncould all be lying to make me feel better. I speculate that in our age of\ndigital communication, the value of a handwritten note has increased a lot,\nmostly owing to the percieved effort required to deliver them.\n\nIn reality though, writing and mailing a card very simple to do. I\u2019m going to\ngo over my process so that you too may be encouraged to send your friends\ncards on their birthdays (and other special occassions!).\n\nStep 1 is figuring out when everyone\u2019s birthday is. If you don\u2019t already have\nall this information it will be the most tedious part of the process,\ninvolving a lot of texts to everyone you know. I store birthday data in my\nGoogle contacts, which should be easily exportable to other formats if I ever\nneed to change my workflow. Make sure you collect their address at the same\ntime if you don\u2019t already have it.\n\nOnce all the information is collected, you need to establish some way of\ngetting an alert prior to everyone\u2019s birthday. I use this app, but the\nfuncationality is baked into Google contacts by default now. Sorry Apple\nusers, I have no idea what to do for you. You\u2019ll want about a week\u2019s notice\nprior to their birthday to make sure that the card gets there on time.\nDomestic (USPS) mail only. International cards usually show up late and\nrequire more advanced notice.\n\nLast step is acquiring the materials. I buy my cards in bulk from Amazon. They\nrun about $0.23 per card. Yes, they\u2019re generic and unremarkable, but that\ndoesn\u2019t matter! As Marie Kondo says \u201cthe purpose of a card is to be received,\nbecause gifts are a means of conveying someone\u2019s feelings.\u201d And they\u2019re going\nto throw it out right away anyways.\n\nThe cards I use.\n\nYou\u2019ll also need stamps. I get mine at Costco. Presently they\u2019re $0.68 per\nstamp.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve got everything established, all that remains to be dilligent\nenough to write the card when your one-week pre-emptive reminder fires. I keep\nthe cards, my pens, and stampes in my office, close enough to my desk that\nit\u2019s not a burden to fetch them as soon as I notice my alert. You don\u2019t need\nto write a lot in each card, I usually don\u2019t commit more than two or three\nsentences. The important thing is that you make it personal.\n\nAs an aside, writing these cards has prompted me to re-learn how to write in\ncursive, I also write with a fountain pen because it\u2019s just fun to use. which\nhas been strangely satisfying! Especially weird as I spent most of the last 20\nyears arrogantly scoffing at the idea that handwriting would ever be something\nI cared about.\n\nOnce the card\u2019s written you just have to address and stamp it and you\u2019re done!\nThough you do need to remember to update the addresses of your friends when\nthey move. I\u2019ve found it\u2019s easy enough to send them an address confirmation\ntext while I\u2019m writing the note. Sometimes I worry this will spoil the\nsurprise of the card, but better that it actually gets to them in the first\nplace.\n\nThat\u2019s my workflow and it\u2019s served me well for the last few years. My friends\nlove getting the cards, and honestly, I really enjoy writing them. It\u2019s very\nsatisfying to put pen to paper and drop a note into the mailbox; it takes me\nback to my childhood when I percieved the world to be a slower and simpler\nplace. I urge you to send your loved ones cards too. At $0.91 and 5 minutes of\nwork, you can hardly find a more efficient way of creating joy.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Timothy Rice\n\n", "frontpage": false}
