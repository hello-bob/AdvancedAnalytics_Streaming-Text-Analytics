The study reinforces the important link\nbetween the gut and the brain.\n\nApril 15, 2024 By Emily Gersema\n\nA new USC-led study on rats that feasted on a high-fat, sugary diet raises the\npossibility that a junk food-filled diet in teens may disrupt their brains\u2019\nmemory ability for a long time.\n\n\u201cWhat we see not just in this paper, but in some of our other recent work, is\nthat if these rats grew up on this junk food diet, then they have these memory\nimpairments that don\u2019t go away,\u201d said Scott Kanoski, a professor of biological\nsciences at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. \u201cIf you\njust simply put them on a healthy diet, these effects unfortunately last well\ninto adulthood.\u201d\n\nThe study appears in the May issue of the journal Brain, Behavior, and\nImmunity.\n\nIn developing the study, Kanoski and lead author and postdoctoral research\nfellow Anna Hayes considered that prior research has shown a link between poor\ndiet and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. People who suffer from Alzheimer\u2019s disease tend\nto have lower levels of a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine in the brain\nthat is essential for memory and functions such as learning, attention,\narousal and involuntary muscle movement.\n\nThe team wondered what this could mean for younger people who may be on a\nsimilar fat-filled, sugary Western diet, particularly during adolescence when\ntheir brain is undergoing significant development. By tracking the impact of\nthe diet on the rats\u2019 levels of acetylcholine and running the rats through\nsome memory testing, they could learn more about the important relationship\nbetween diet and memory.\n\nThe researchers tracked the acetylcholine levels of a group of rats on a\nfatty, sugary diet and in a control group of rats by analyzing their brain\nresponses to certain tasks designed to test their memory. The team examined\nthe rats\u2019 brains post-mortem for signs of disrupted acetylcholine levels.\n\nThe memory test involved letting the rats explore new objects in different\nlocations. Days later, the researchers reintroduced the rats to the scene that\nwas nearly identical except for the addition of one new object. Rats on the\njunk food diet showed signs they could not remember which object they had\npreviously seen, and where, while those in the control group showed\nfamiliarity.\n\n\u201cAcetylcholine signaling is a mechanism to help them encode and remember those\nevents, analogous to \u2018episodic memory\u2019 in humans that allows us to remember\nevents from our past,\u201d lead author Hayes explained. \u201cThat signal appears to\nnot be happening in the animals that grew up eating the fatty, sugary diet.\u201d\n\nKanoski emphasized that adolescence is a very sensitive period for the brain\nwhen important changes are occurring in development. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to say\nthis without sounding like Cassandra and doom and gloom,\u201d he said, \u201cbut\nunfortunately, some things that may be more easily reversible during adulthood\nare less reversible when they are occurring during childhood.\u201d\n\nThere is at least some hope for intervention. Kanoski said that in another\nround of the study, the research team examined whether the memory damage in\nrats raised on the junk food diet could be reversed with medication that\ninduces the release of acetylcholine. They used two drugs, PNU-282987 and\ncarbachol, and found that with those treatments given directly to the\nhippocampus, a brain region that controls memory and is disrupted in\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease, the rats\u2019 memory ability was restored.\n\nBut without that special medical intervention, Kanoski said more research is\nneeded to know how memory problems from a junk food diet during adolescence\ncan be reversed.\n\nIn addition to Kanoski and Hayes, the team included other USC Dornsife\nresearchers Logan Tierno Lauer, Alicia E.
