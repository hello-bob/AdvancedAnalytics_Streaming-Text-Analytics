To give you a better idea of what this CLI application does,\nit can track files with the extension '.*.rb' in real time and transpile them\nto another file with native JS script (note that the extension has a star and\nthis indicates the type of file we want to save the transpiled script to).\n\nThe program utilizes a Ruby2JS transpiler in conjunction with a separate\nmodule for monitoring file modifications. The collaboration of these libraries\nresulted in the creation of this RubyJS tool. It can be used almost anywhere,\nas long as the virtual environment supports ECMAScript (JS). There are various\ntools like this one, such as TypeScript, Fable, and CoffeeScript, that offer\nsimilar functionalities. You can utilize your preferred scripting syntax to\nexecute the supplied command. However, these transpilers have a disadvantage\nin that they only provide a JavaScript API.\n\nAnother possibility of the CLI application tool is that it has its own\necosystem created by inserting a plugin into it, which extends the\nfunctionality of the RubyJS tool. The default plugin is a scaffold that can\ngenerate various elements. With this plugin, you can create a new web project\nthat is built exactly for RubyJS-Vite, or add a new DOM Element to a web\nproject for faster site creation (something similar to Ruby on Rails). I\nrecommend studying Ruby2JS so you can write scripts to transpile into native\nJS. There's a lot that this Ruby2JS library can do, and it's mostly\nconfiguration independent. What I mean by this is that you can configure the\ntranspiler using a configuration file. Just add 'config/ruby2js.rb' to your\nproject and the RubyJS CLI tool will recognize this file and adapt to the\nconfigurations.\n\n> ### Info\n>\n> Since the Vite tool is a secondary feature of the RubyJS tool, it is\n> appropriate to refer to the combined tool as RubyJS-Vite, which is available\n> online. Therefore, both RubyJS and RubyJS-Vite are identical tools.\n\nPowered by docs plugin. Generated on: 26. 03. 2024 12:52:42\n\n", "frontpage": false}
