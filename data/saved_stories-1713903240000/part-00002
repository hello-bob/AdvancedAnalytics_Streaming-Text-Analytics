Malay Mail charts Pua\u2019s rise and contribution to storage\nsolutions which has changed the way we store, transfer and access digital\ndata:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHumble beginnings\n\nBorn in 1974, Pua worked his way up from humble roots in Sekinchan, Selangor,\nto the top of his field as the founder of Phison in Taiwan.\n\nAccording to a report by local startup and SME-centred media platform,\nWargaBiz, Pua was educated at Pin Hwa High School in Klang.\n\nHe was then accepted to the National Chiao Tung University in Taiwan where he\nmajored in Electrical and Control Engineering.\n\nAfter graduating, Pua ventured into the field of semiconductor technology, as\nhe saw the immense potential of emerging technologies like flash memory.\n\nIn 2000, at the age of 27, he founded Phison Electronics Corporation in\nTaiwan, together with four other partners.\n\nA page from Sidec\u2019s slide on Malaysia Semiconductor Accelerator & IC Design\nPark: Selangor Hub.\n\nWhat is Phison Electronics?\n\nPhison penetrated Taiwan\u2019s tech market with the vision of harnessing the power\nof flash memory to create a new generation of storage solutions.\n\nThe company\u2019s groundbreaking innovation eventually pushed out the then go-to\nstorage system, the floppy disc, due to its impracticality and limited storage\ncapacity.\n\nPhison became a prominent player in the semiconductor industry, providing\ncontroller integrated circuits for solid-state drives (SSDs), universal serial\nbus (USB) flash drives, memory cards, and other storage devices.\n\nAccording to a MyStarJob report, Pua invented the first single-chip USB flash\nstorage device, which was an improvement over the older and more laborious\nmulti-chip designs, despite the fact that USB storage devices had already been\ninvestigated and produced in Israel and the United States.\n\nThe new product, called the \u201cpendrive,\u201d was not only cheaper to make than\nprevious storage devices, but also smaller and more capable of holding larger\namounts of data.\n\nOver the years, the storage solutions company has grown to employ over 3,800\nemployees globally with more than 75 per cent of them being engineers.\n\nUnder Pua\u2019s leadership as the chief executive, the group has emerged as a\ntrailblazer in the NAND flash controller technology.\n\nOvercoming setbacks\n\nDatuk KS Pua speaks at the KL20 Summit 2024 in Kuala Lumpur April 23, 2024. \u2015\nPicture by Miera Zulyana\n\nPua and his partners experienced a major setback prior to its establishment in\nNovember 2000.\n\nAccording to MyStarJob, the investors, who had promised NT$30 million, only\noffered NT$1million and shareholders refused to offer financial backing as\nneeded.\n\nThis saw Pua and his partners struggling to raise funds desperately from their\nfamilies, relatives and friends.\n\nTheir first product to debut was a patented five-in-one card reader. They\ndeveloped their first pendrive in 2002.\n\nFollowing the success, the company managed to impress giant information\ntechnology industry companies, such as Toshiba and M-Systems, which invested\nin Phison\u2019s next projects.\n\nPhison now plays a critical role in supplying essential technology for data\nstorage across both consumer and enterprise-level products. Its storage\nsolutions can be found in personal computers, gaming consoles, and\nsmartphones.\n\nIt employs a team of approximately 4,000 engineers, including around 200\nMalaysians.\n\nMalaysian Friendship and Trade Centre in Taipei\u2019s meeting with KS Pua,\nFebruary 23, 2023. \u2014 Picture courtesy of Malaysian Friendship and Trade Centre\nin Taipei\n\nRevisiting investment in Malaysia\n\nPhison had established a presence in Malaysia in 2012. However, the group\ncompleted the liquidation of Phisontech Electronics (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd in\nOctober 2020.\n\nIn his interview with The Edge Malaysia last year, Pua mentioned that their\nplans to reinvest in Malaysia were driven by demand from their clients to\ndiversify operations outside Taiwan.\n\n\u201cWhy now? Because my clients from the US have been urging us [to diversify\nelsewhere] since last October.\n\n\u201cPhison has zero debt. We have no loans from the banks, and we are doing US$2\nbillion (RM8.9 billion) in business annually. We are a cash-generating\nbusiness.\n\n\u201cWhile we intend to move certain portions of assembly to Thailand and South\nKorea, I never thought of moving our design base until [around] January and\nFebruary, as we began to have some confidence in the current government. After\nPrime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim\u2019s China trip, we thought maybe it is\ngood timing now,\u201d he was quoted as saying by The Edge.\n\nThe business media outlet further reported that Pua believes if Phison could\nestablish itself as a viable firm in Malaysia, it would serve as a model for\nother international IT businesses looking to invest in the nation.\n\nAs early as February last year, Pua had arranged a meeting with the Foreign\nMinistry\u2019s Malaysian Friendship and Trade Centre in Taipei \u2014 where the mission\nsaid it was exploring \u201cpossible collaboration to benefit fellow Malaysians\u201d.\n\nBy March this year, Pua had met with Ng Sze Han, the Selangor executive\ncouncillor of investment, trade and mobility, in Hsinchu, Taiwan to discuss\nSelangor\u2019s proposal for the IC Design Park.\n\n\u201cThanks Datuk KS Pua, the founder and CEO of Phison Electronics Corporation\nfor driving me around in Hsinchu, Taiwan. We had a fruitful discussion during\nour meeting here. Stay tuned for a more exciting announcement soon,\u201d Ng said\nin a Facebook post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## You May Also Like\n\nRecommended by\n\n## Related Articles\n\nMalaysia / 1d ago\n\n## Malaysia AI Storage: A new multi-million venture supported by Phison\n\nMalaysia / 1d ago\n\n## IC Design Park set to bring in economic returns of RM500m to RM1b, says\nSidec CEO\n\nMalaysia / 15 m ago\n\n## Helicopter tragedy: Mohammad Amirulfaris described as someone who was firm,\nrespectful\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Just IN\n\n15 m ago\n\n## Helicopter tragedy: Mohammad Amirulfaris described as someone who was firm,\nrespectful\n\n35 m ago\n\n## Navy helicopter crash: Families shell-shocked over tragedy\n\n46 m ago\n\n## Education system must be synonymous with country\u2019s development, says Zambry\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  * News\n  *     * Malaysia\n    * Singapore\n    * World\n    * Money\n    * Life\n    * Eat/Drink\n  *     * Showbiz\n    * Opinion\n    * What You Think\n    * Sports\n    * Tech/Gadgets\n\n  * About\n  * ARCHIVES\n  * ABOUT US\n  * PRIVACY POLICY\n  * TERMS OF USE\n  * ADVERTISE\n\nDownload\n\nSubscribe to Newsletter\n\n\u00a9 2021, Malay Mail, All Rights Reserved.\n\n\u2191\n\n## Welcome to Malay Mail\n\n# Malay Mail asks for your consent to use your personal data to:\n\n  * perm_identity\n\nPersonalised advertising and content, advertising and content measurement,\naudience research and services development\n\n  * devices\n\nStore and/or access information on a device\n\n  * How can I change my choice?\n\n  * What if I don't consent?\n\n  * How does legitimate interest work?\n\n  * Do I have to consent to everything?\n\nYour personal data will be processed and information from your device\n(cookies, unique identifiers, and other device data) may be stored by,\naccessed by and shared with 136 TCF vendor(s) and 62 ad partner(s), or used\nspecifically by this site or app.\n\nSome vendors may process your personal data on the basis of legitimate\ninterest, which you can object to by managing your options below.
