After a press enquiry from Podnews, Spotify\u2019s Megaphone, Chartable and the Spotify for Podcasters host formerly known as Anchor were removed from the published list of compliant companies for podcast measurement. They last underwent certification in 2020.\n\n    * \u201cSpotify values our longstanding partnership with the IAB,\u201d a Spotify spokesperson told Podnews. \u201cFor 2024, we\u2019re taking a pause to make sure that we can participate in an active way and will reevaluate a formal membership later this year. In the meantime, Spotify remains committed to the IAB mission. We champion its efforts and remain deeply connected to the work supporting digital advertising without direct membership this year. While Megaphone, Chartable and S4P are not officially IAB certified at this time, all three platforms are compliant to the IAB v2.1 standard.\u201d\n    * Spotify is the largest global digital audio advertising company, with ad-supported revenue in Q4/23 of \u20ac501mn ($533mn), compared with SiriusXM $479mn; iHeart digital audio revenue $317mn; Cumulus digital revenue $221mn; Audacy digital revenue $69.1mn; Acast $45mn. All these other companies are IAB members.\n    * We\u2019d like to carry views from the rest of the industry about this news later this week. Please hit reply (or mail editor@podnews.net) if you\u2019ve something to say.\n  * Podcast hosting company Podbean has been also removed from the list of IAB compliant companies. They were last certified in 2020. The IAB\u2019s Compliance Certification Guide states (p12) that a company must submit for certification at least once in the past twelve months.\n\n  * Last week, Libsyn was recertified under the IAB Podcast Measurement Guidelines v2.1. Captivate and Buzzsprout were last certified under v2.0 in 2020, but both companies are in the process of recertification.\n\n    * The IAB doesn\u2019t publish the costs for undergoing podcast measurement certification; they are - Member: $12,500 (new) / $6,250 (renew); Non-Member: $17,500 (new) / $8,750 (renew).\n\nClassifieds - your job or ad here\n\n\ud83c\udf51 Swell AI: Content repurposing for podcasts \u2014 Turn podcasts into video clips,\nblog posts, newsletters & more.

We appreciate your support, allowing us to better resource our\nindependent journalism around podcasting. You can be like Dots and support us\ntoo.\n\n## Moves and hires\n\n  * Want to work on one of the top fifteen podcasts in the UK? Global is looking for an Executive Podcast Producer for The News Agents.\n\n## The Tech Stuff - with RSS.com\n\nOpen RSS depends on the podcasting community and the podcasting community\ndepends on open RSS. Distribution, data, monetization, and especially\ninnovation are all possible through open RSS feeds. Podcasting is better with\nRSS. Get your own podcast and an innovative RSS feed at RSS.com\n\n  * You can now follow your favourite podcast on the fediverse - Mastodon, Pleroma and similar. PodcastAP will help you find the automated accounts - you can even upload OPML to it. Podnews is on the fediverse properly as @podnews@social.podnews.net - we\u2019d love to see you there.\n\n  * We\u2019re now rate-limiting our podcast pages after significant, sustained crawling from IP addresses belonging to Microsoft. You (and they) can download a complete podcast database from the Podcast Index; extra costs for us have been well over $750. Anyone got Bill\u2019s address?\n\n  * Spotify is supporting chapters - well, Podlove\u2019s chapters. This show has chapter points in it; hosted by RSS Blue, the RSS feed is here.\n\n  * We\u2019ve added an indication in our podcast pages for where podcasts use Podcasting 2.0 features, and are now showing \u201cother shows you may enjoy\u201d from both incoming and outgoing podroll mentions. The Podnews Weekly Review is a good example. Our podcast pages now only play the trailer (if there is one), rather than a list of episodes - we\u2019d prefer you used a proper podcast app for that!\n\n  * Truefans got a good magazine article writeup in the City, University of London alumni magazine. (CEO Sam Sethi went there).\n\n  * Open podcast analytics service OP3 has added a new API and renamed one. They\u2019re also looking for translations.\n\n## Tips and tricks - with Memberful\n\nMemberful allows podcasters to earn sustainable, recurring revenue through\nmembership. Reward your listeners with benefits like ad-free shows, community\nspaces, behind-the-scenes content, bonus episodes, and more. The best part?\nYou have complete control and ownership of your brand, your podcast, and your\nmembership.\n\n  * Wondering how other podcasts like yours are doing in downloads? OP3 analytics are open to everyone, and our sister publication Podcast Business Journal publishes a selection of podcasts measured by the service, to help you compare.\n\n  * While the list of shows measured by OP3 is around 2,000 - and so is unlikely to be entirely representative of everyone - this shows the share of downloads over the past 30 days by podcast app. Spotify has a share of 49%.\n\n## Podcast News - with New Podcast Trailers - the podcast\n\nTrailers from shows featured in Podnews - in your podcast player: updated\nevery day with new things to listen to.

Carr has a new Netflix special out, which was\nsurprisingly good timing, given his controversial joke that we mentioned\nearlier. He talks cancel culture, \u201coutrage archaeology\u201d, and the joke that\nwill end his career.\n\nThe Price of Paradise is new today from Wondery - the true story of two women\nwho found themselves on the opposite sides of the same battle. One woman is\nswapping rural England for a sun-drenched utopia. The other is fighting for\nindigenous rights. But it\u2019s a story that will end in kidnap, corruption and\nmurder.\n\nDog parks are important public spaces, argues the new podcast Dog Parkology -\na dog park is a space that allows our dogs to play with each other, but also a\nspace that allows us to connect with strangers and build community in a way\nthat we rarely have the opportunity for anymore. And someone\u2019s bound to bring\nsome snacks.\n\nOn the Media Voices Podcast this week, our Editor, James Cridland, talks about\nrunning a newsletter, and the podcast industry: \u201cThere\u2019s a tale of two\nindustries at the moment. There\u2019s the US, which probably overheated. And then\nthere\u2019s the rest of the world where slow and steady wins the race.\u201d\n\nCompanies mentioned above:\nAcastAnchorAudacyBuzzsproutCaptivateChartableFlightpathIABLibsynMegaphoneOP3Podcast\nBusiness JournalPodnewsRealmSiriusXMSpotify\n\n## Podcast data for Apr 22\n\n#1 in Apple Podcasts The Joe Rogan Experience (Joe Rogan) Bhagavad Gita\n(Spydor Studios)\n\n#1 in Spotify The Joe Rogan Experience (Joe Rogan) SHRIMAD BHAGWADGITA (Amit\nWadhwa)\n\nOver the last week, 209,510 podcasts published at least one new episode (down\n0.0%). source\n\n## Events\n\n  * Launch Your Podcast 5- Day Challenge for Female Entrepreneurs\ufe0f: Apr 22 \u00b7 Virtual \u00b7 free\n  * PodTalksDXB: Rianna Croxford: Apr 23 \u00b7 \u062f\u0628\u064a, \u062f\u0628\u064a, United Arab Emirates\n  * Importance of Being Authentically You: Live Podcast (Free Pizza & Drink): Apr 24 \u00b7 Brighton, England, UK\n  * Podcast World Tour Makes a Stop in Texas!: Apr 25 \u00b7 Dallas, Texas, USA\n  * Using AI in sound design - Next in Audio: Jun 4 \u00b7 Melbourne, Victoria, Australia\n\nThis section is continually updated.
