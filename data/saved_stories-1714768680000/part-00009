Several major missions are set\nfor launch in the next few months. These include the first crew flight on\nBoeing's Starliner spacecraft, set for liftoff on May 6, and the next test\nflight of SpaceX's Starship rocket, which could happen before the end of May.\nPerhaps as soon as early summer, SpaceX could launch the Polaris Dawn mission\nwith four private astronauts, who will perform the first fully commercial\nspacewalk in orbit. In June or July, Europe's new Ariane 6 rocket is slated to\nlaunch for the first time. Rest assured, Ars will have it all covered.\n\nAs always, we welcome reader submissions, and if you don't want to miss an\nissue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-\nenabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-,\nmedium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next\nthree launches on the calendar.\n\nGerman rocket arrives at Scottish spaceport. Rocket Factory Augsburg has\ndelivered a booster for its privately developed RFA One rocket to SaxaVord\nSpaceport in Scotland, the company announced on X. The first stage for the RFA\nOne rocket was installed on its launch pad at SaxaVord to undergo preparations\nfor a static fire test. The booster arrived at the Scottish launch site with\nfive of its kerosene-fueled Helix engines. The remaining four Helix engines,\nfor a total of nine, will be fitted to the RFA One booster at SaxaVord, the\ncompany said.\n\nAiming to fly this year... RFA hopes to launch its first orbital-class rocket\nby the end of 2024. The UK's Civil Aviation Authority last month granted a\nrange license to SaxaVord Spaceport to allow the spaceport operator to control\nthe sea and airspace during a launch. RFA is primarily privately funded but\nhas won financial support from the European Space Agency, the UK Space Agency,\nand the German space agency, known as DLR. The RFA One rocket will have three\nstages, stand nearly 100 feet (30 meters) tall, and can carry nearly 2,900\npounds (1,300 kilograms) of payload into a polar Sun-synchronous orbit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArianespace wins ESA launch contract. The European Space Agency has awarded\nArianespace a contract to launch a joint European-Chinese space science\nsatellite in late 2025, European Spaceflight reports. The Solar wind\nMagnetosphere Ionosphere Link Explorer (SMILE) is a 4,850-pound\n(2,200-kilogram) spacecraft that will study Earth\u2019s magnetic environment on a\nglobal scale. The aim of the mission is to build a more complete understanding\nof the Sun-Earth connection. On Tuesday, ESA officially signed a contract for\nArianespace to launch SMILE aboard a Vega C rocket, which is built by the\nItalian rocket-maker Avio.\n\nBut it may not keep it ... In late 2023, ESA member states agreed to allow\nAvio to market and manage the launch of Vega C flights independent of\nArianespace. When the deal was initially struck, 17 flights were contracted\nthrough Arianespace to be launched aboard Vega vehicles. While these missions\nare still managed by Arianespace, Avio is working with the launch provider to\nstrike a deal that would allow the Italian rocket builder to assume the\nmanagement of all Vega flights. The Vega C rocket has been grounded since a\nlaunch failure in 2022 forced Avio to redesign the nozzle of the rocket's\nsolid-fueled second-stage motor. Vega C is scheduled to return to flight\nbefore the end of 2024.

ABL Space Systems expected to launch its second\nlight-class RS1 rocket earlier this year, but the company encountered an\nanomaly during ground testing at the launch site in Alaska, according to Aria\nAlamalhodaei of TechCrunch. Kevin Sagis, ABL's chief engineer, said there is\n\"no significant delay\" in the launch of the second RS1 rocket, but the company\nhas not announced a firm schedule. \"During ground testing designed to screen\nthe vehicle for flight, an issue presented that caused us to roll back to the\nhangar,\" Sagis said, according to Alamalhodaei. \"We have since resolved and\ndispositioned the issue. There was no loss of hardware and we have validated\nvehicle health back out on the pad. We are continuing with preparations for\nstatic fire and launch.\"\n\nNearly 16 months without a launch ... ABL's first RS1 test flight in January\n2023 ended seconds after liftoff with the premature shutdown of its liquid-\nfueled engines. The rocket crashed back onto its launch pad in Alaska. An\ninvestigation revealed a fire in the aft end of the RS1 booster burned through\nwiring harnesses, causing the rocket to lose power and shut off its engines.\nEngineers believe the rocket's mobile launch mount was too small, placing the\nrocket too close to the ground when it ignited its engines. This caused the\nhot engine exhaust to recirculate under the rocket and led to a fire in the\nengine compartment as it took off.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n33\n\nStephen Clark Stephen Clark is a space reporter at Ars Technica, covering\nprivate space companies and the world\u2019s space agencies.
