Why? Because it will improve your code.\n\nComing from an engineer, that might seem counterintuitive, but the ability to\ndevelop crisp mental models around the problems you want to solve and\nunderstanding the why before you start working on the how is an increasingly\ncritical skill, especially in the age of AI.\n\nCoding is one of the things AI does best. Often AI can write higher quality\ncode than humans, and its capabilities are quickly improving. Computer\nlanguages, you see, use a vocabulary that\u2019s much more limited than human\nlanguages. And because an AI model\u2019s complexity increases quadratically with\nthe universe of symbols that represent the language that\u2019s understood by the\nAI, a smaller vocabulary means faster, better results.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s something of a catch here: Code created by an AI can be\nsyntactically and semantically correct but not functionally correct. In other\nwords, it can work well, but not do what you want it to do. A model\u2019s output\nis very sensitive to the way a prompt is written. Miss the mark on the prompt,\nand your AI will produce code that\u2019s plausible at best, incorrect and\ndangerous at worst.\n\nIn the emerging discipline called \u201cprompt engineering\u201d \u2014 at this stage more of\nan art than a science \u2014 users learn how to hand-craft prompts that are\ncompact, expressive, and effective at getting the AI to do what they want.\nVarious techniques exist, such as few-shot prompting, where one prepends a\nnumber of examples to the prompt to guide the AI toward the right path,\nsometimes with questions and answers. For example, for sentiment analysis\nusing few-shot prompting, a user might input a prompt like \u201cAnalyze the\nsentiment of sentences in an earnings call\u201d followed by specific examples such\nas \u201cImproved outlook: Positive\u201d or \u201cSlowing demand: Negative\u201d to help the AI\nunderstand the pattern and context for generating accurate sentiment analyses\nbased on examples.\n\nOne of the most important skills I\u2019ve learned in decades of managing\nengineering teams is to ask the right questions. It\u2019s not dissimilar with AI:\nThe quality of the output of a large language model (LLM) is very sensitive to\nthe quality of the prompt. Ambiguous or not well-formed questions will make\nthe AI try to guess the question you are really asking, which in turn\nincreases the probability of getting an imprecise or even totally made-up\nanswer (a phenomenon that\u2019s often referred to as \u201challucination\u201d). Because of\nthat, one would have to first and foremost master reasoning, logic, and first-\nprinciples thinking to get the most out of AI \u2014 all foundational skills\ndeveloped through philosophical training. The question \u201cCan you code?\u201d will\nbecome \u201cCan you get the best code out of your AI by asking the right\nquestion?\u201d\n\nZooming out a bit, the dependency of AI performance on the quality of the\nmental models expressed by the user prompting the AI suggests a fundamental\nshift in the relationship between authors and readers, and, in general, to our\nrelationship to knowledge. In a way, it offers a parallel to the invention of\nthe printing press, which democratized information through mass production of\nbooks, and the creation of libraries and universities. Before the printing\npress, if you wanted to learn about mathematics, for example, you likely had\nto have physical access to a mathematician or access to a hand-copied text,\nlikely purchased at great expense. Printed books made that barrier much lower,\nand the internet reduced it to virtually zero. Still, a barrier remained which\nis the knowledge gap between the author and the reader. You can have access to\nany paper or book in the world, but they are of little use if you can\u2019t\nunderstand them.\n\nWorking with AI, that relationship changes, as does the notion of authorship.\nAn LLM adapts its content to the level of knowledge and understanding of the\nreader, taking cues from their prompts. The reader\u2019s prompt is the seed that\ntriggers an AI to produce content, drawing on the works in its training data\nto create a new text specifically for that user \u2014 the reader is, in a sense,\nboth consumer and author. Using the mathematics example, if you wanted to\nunderstand the concept of limits in calculus, you could find a textbook aimed\nat high school or college students or attempt to find a source on the Internet\nthat matches your current level of understanding. An AI model, on the other\nhand, can provide personalized and adaptive instruction tailored to your level\nof understanding and learning style. There may be a future where the gold\nstandard of learning \u2014 personalized tutoring \u2014 may be available to everyone.\nThe consequences of that are unimaginable.\n\nGenerative AI changes our relationship with knowledge, flattening barriers\nthat not only provide access to it, but also explain it in a tailored\napproach. It creates a gentle slope between your level of knowledge and the\nlevel of knowledge required to attack a particular subject. But the ability to\naccess knowledge that is appropriately tailored and, more importantly,\naccurate, starts \u2014 and ends \u2014 with the user. As knowledge gets easier to\nobtain, reasoning becomes more and more important. But the use of those\nphilosophical thinking skills does not end once you get the output you think\nyou were looking for \u2014 the job is not yet done. As we know, AIs can make\nmistakes, and they\u2019re particularly good at making incorrect outputs seem\nplausible, making the ability to discern truth another hugely important skill.\nIn order to engage with the technology in a responsible way that gets us the\nappropriate and accurate information we want, we must lead with a\nphilosophical mindset and a healthy dose of skepticism and common sense\nthroughout the entire journey.\n\nThere was a point in time where, in order to create a computer program, I had\nto physically flip switches or punch holes in a paper card. That creation\nprocess was at ground level with the intricacies of how many bits of memory or\nregisters the computer possessed. With billions of transistors and trillions\nof memory cells, our software creative process had to raise to higher and\nhigher levels with the creation of computer languages that would abstract the\ncomplexity of the underlying hardware, allowing developers to focus almost\nentirely on the quality of the algorithm versus the ones and the zeros.\n\nToday, we are at a point where computers (i.e., AI) do not need this\nintermediate level of translation between the language we speak and the one\nthey understand. We can set aside the Rosetta Stone and just speak English to\na computer. They will likely understand just as well as when speaking to them\nin Python. This immediately presents two choices: We can get lazy, or we can\nelevate our thought.\n\nWhen language is no longer the barrier, we can employ the full expressivity of\nhuman language to convey to the AI higher concepts and logic, that would\ncapture our request in the most compact and effective way, in a way that\u2019s\ndeclarative (focused on the result we want to obtain) vs. imperative (focused\non the steps of how to get there). Imperative: Turn left, then go straight,\nthen left again, then (1,000 times). Declarative: Take me home. I\u2019ve seen\npeople on social media create entire games with just a few skillfully written\nprompts that in the very recent past would have taken months to develop.\n\nWhich is back to my original point: Having a crisp mental model around a\nproblem, being able to break it down into steps that are tractable, perfect\nfirst-principle thinking, sometimes being prepared (and able to) debate a\nstubborn AI \u2014 these are the skills that will make a great engineer in the\nfuture, and likely the same consideration applies to many job categories.\n\nWe don\u2019t want to lose the ability to open the hood when needed and fix things\nthat an AI may have missed or be in a position (importantly) to audit what an\nAI has created. That would be a real problem for humans, and we won\u2019t likely\nlet that happen \u2014 we still have to build the AIs at the very least. However,\nthat would only take us partially there. Automating the mechanics of code\ncreation and focusing on our critical thinking abilities is what will allow us\nto create more, faster and have disproportionate impact on the world. Helping\nAI help us be more human, less computer.\n\nNew!\n\nHBR Learning\n\nDigital Intelligence Course\n\nAccelerate your career with Harvard ManageMentor\u00ae.
