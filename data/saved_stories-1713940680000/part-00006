The bill would extend copyright\nprotection to codes (such as building codes) that are developed by standards\ndevelopment organizations (SDOs) and incorporated by reference into local,\nstate, and federal laws, as long as the SDOs make the codes \u201cavailable to the\npublic free of charge online in a manner that does not substantially disrupt\nthe ability of those organizations to earn revenue.\u201d\n\nThis is the latest development in a long-running battle between SDOs and\npublic interest groups that have posted online standards incorporated by\nreference. SDOs have sued these public interest groups for copyright\ninfringement, and the public interest groups have argued that once the\nstandards are incorporated by reference, they lose their copyright protection.\nThe public interest groups have argued in the alternative that the fair use\nright permits the online posting of the standards. The courts have ruled in\nfavor of the public interest groups on the fair use theory without addressing\nthe protectability argument. The Pro Codes Act seeks to foreclose the\nprotectability argument without directly implicating the fair use theory.\n\nThe SDOs supporting the Pro Codes Act assert that it would increase access to\nthe law by incentivizing the SDOs to provide online \u201creading rooms\u201d where the\npublic could read the standards incorporated by reference. However, such\nreading rooms are unnecessary because public interest groups already provide\nfree online access to the standards in more usable formats. As Corynne\nMcSherry, legal director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), stated:\n\u201cThis legislation is a solution in search of a problem: at least one public\ninterest organization is already providing much better access to the law, also\nfor free, with no financial impact on the standard organizations.\u201d In 2023,\nMcSherry successfully represented Public.Resource.Org in ASTM v.\nPublic.Resource.Org, where the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit held\nthat fair use permitted Public.Resource.Org to post online codes incorporated\nby reference because it served a nonprofit, educational purpose.\n\nDuring this week\u2019s markup of the Pro Codes Act, Representative Zoe Lofgren\n(D-CA) introduced dozens of amendments to improve the bill, one of which would\ncodify the ASTM precedent established by the DC Circuit. Unfortunately, the\ncommittee rejected this amendment. (In fact, the committee voted down all of\nLofgren\u2019s amendments, except for one that would require the Government\nAccountability Office to study the effects of the bill.)\n\nRep. Lofgren also entered into the record an opposition letter in which a\ncoalition of libraries, civil society, disability rights groups, and others\nargue that providing free access to the law furthers the fundamental purpose\nof copyright, which is to allow public access to knowledge. Some of the\nletter\u2019s signers also made this point in an amicus brief in ASTM v.\nPublic.Resource.Org:\n\nThe Copyright Act ultimately aims to achieve the Constitutional goal to\n\u201cpromote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited\nTimes to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective\nWritings and Discoveries.\u201d U.S. Const. art 1, cl. 8, sec. 8.\n\nDuring this week\u2019s markup, some members of the House Judiciary Committee\ndisplayed a fundamental misunderstanding of copyright law. Proponents of Pro\nCodes claimed that the bill would strike a balance between copyright law and\npublic access to information. But copyright law and access to information are\nnot in tension; facilitating access to information is the constitutional\npurpose of copyright, as the library and civil society groups wrote in their\nbrief in support of Public.Resource.Org.\n\nSome members of the committee tried to parse standards incorporated by\nreference from other elements of the law. But as Rep. Lofgren rightly noted,\nin 2020 the Supreme Court reaffirmed the \u201cgovernment edicts doctrine\u201d that\nworks created by government officials in the course of their official duties\nare not copyrightable. Accordingly, when a work is incorporated by reference\ninto an official government document it has the force of law and belongs in\nthe public domain. In 2019, the Library Copyright Alliance (LCA) filed an\namicus brief in State of Georgia v. Public.Resource.Org asking the Supreme\nCourt to affirm this reasoning, and explaining how libraries rely on the\ngovernment edicts doctrine to preserve and provide access to the cultural\nrecord, including all elements of the law.\n\nAnother flawed argument by lawmakers at the Pro Codes markup is that standards\nincorporated by reference is an unfair \u201ctaking\u201d of the SDOs\u2019 copyrights under\nthe Fifth Amendment. As the lawmakers\u2019 argument goes, governments must\ncompensate property owners when they take over private property for public use\nunder eminent domain; similarly, the government should extend copyright to the\nSDOs in exchange for the use of their standards. But this analogy falls apart\nbecause there is no reluctance on the part of the SDOs for the adoption of\ntheir standards; in fact, the SDOs actively lobby governments to adopt their\nstandards.\n\nA related argument by supporters of the Pro Codes Act is that the SDOs provide\na valuable service, and therefore they deserve a revenue stream in exchange\nfor their contribution to the public good. But copyright law does not grant\ncopyright to reward hard work (Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service).\nFurther, the DC Circuit Court found that although Public.Resource.Org has been\nposting incorporated standards for 15 years, \u201cthe plaintiffs have been unable\nto produce any economic analysis showing that Public Resource\u2019s activity has\nharmed any relevant market for their standards. To the contrary, ASTM\u2019s sales\nhave increased over that time.\u201d The SDOs can also derive significant revenue\nfrom selling training materials and programs. SDOs do not need a copyright\nincentive; the development of standards advances the economic interests of\ntheir members.\n\nAdditionally, Rep. Lofgren pointed out that, in 2020, the Supreme Court in\nGeorgia v. Public.Resource.Org found constitutional limits to legislatures\u2019\nability to expand copyright. Chief Justice Roberts stated \u201cno one can own the\nlaw\u201d and reaffirmed that if \u201cevery citizen is presumed to know the law, ... it\nneeds no argument to show ... that all should have free access\u201d to its\ncontents. Pro Codes would be unconstitutional under the First, Fifth, and\nFourteenth amendments, which guarantee the public\u2019s rights to read, share, and\ndiscuss the law.\n\nIt is worth noting that several House Judiciary Committee members made nearly\nidentical arguments in favor of the bill, and I assume the standards\ndevelopment organizations circulated talking points in advance of the markup.\nWe know that passing the Pro Codes Act is a major legislative priority for the\nSDOs.\n\nARL and our fellow advocates are disappointed that the Pro Codes Act will\nadvance to the House, particularly since the House did not hold a hearing on\nthe bill. We remain grateful to Representative Lofgren, who has defended\ncopyright law against overprotection for decades.\n\nCopyright, Fair Use, Legislation, Public Policy\n\n#### Affiliates\n\n#### Association of Research Libraries\n\n21 Dupont Circle NW #800 Washington, DC 20036 202 296 2296 | webmgr@arl.org\n\n\u00a9 Association of Research Libraries\n\n", "frontpage": true}
