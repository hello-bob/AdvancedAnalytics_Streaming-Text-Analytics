It was never turned on.\n\n#### Jon Keegan\n\nMar 27, 2023 \u2022 7 min read\n\nPhotos: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.\n\nOn Friday, February 21, 1986 a group of 300 scientists, engineers, contractors\nand government officials gathered for a dedication ceremony at Lawrence\nLivermore National Laboratory. After final diagnostic tests, the \"Mirror\nFusion Test Facility-B\" (MFTF-B) completion was celebrated, and a letter from\nJohn Herrington, Ronald Regan's Secretary of Energy was presented to program\ndirector T. Kenneth Fowler extending his congratulations on a job well done.\n\nOn the very same day after nearly a decade of development and nearly a billion\ndollars* of funding, the project was shut down, the massive machine having\nnever been turned on.\n\n\"I want all of you to know how much I regret the fact that, just as you\ncomplete this remarkable new facility, the budget pressures dictate that we\nmust put it into standby and not operate it as you might have hoped. This is\nfrustrating, and perhaps not the best use of our national talent and\nresources, but we must bring the deficit under control,\" wrote Herrington in\nthe letter to Fowler.\n\nPhotos of the 400-ton \"yin-yang\" magnet mirrors used in the MFTF-B.

Photo 1, Photo 2.\n\nI came across photos from the construction of the components of the MFTF-B on\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory\u2019s website and was captivated by a photo\nfrom 1980 showing a strange twisting mass of metal that at the time was the\nlargest superconducting magnet in the world.\n\nThis 350 ton magnet was encased in stainless steel built in a distinct \u201cyin-\nyang\u201d shape, and its interior was cooled to temperatures of 425o F below zero,\nby pumping liquid helium through the vessel. Thirty miles of copper and\nniobium-titanium wire were wound over the course of a year to make the\nmagnet\u2019s conductor. The magnet was capable of generating magnetic fields\n150,000 times that of Earth\u2019s that could contain the 500-million Kelvin degree\nplasma generated by the fusion device.\n\nA photo of the MFTF-B under construction in 1978.

Kenneth Fowler\u2019s 1997 book, \u201cThe\nFusion Quest\u201d. Fowler continued, \u201cToday, irresistibly drawn to the challenge\nof bringing fusion energy down to Earth from the stars, scientists tempt Zeus\nstill.\u201d The promise of mastering this elemental force is a clean, safe and\nnear limitless energy source, which could literally save the planet.\n\nWhile the more widely known process of nuclear fission has been producing\nenergy at commercial scale in power plants since the 1950\u2019s, harnessing\nnuclear fusion \u2013 which Fowler\u2019s poetic description accurately captures as the\nsame reaction taking place in the heart of the Sun \u2013 has been the subject of\nan international race for decades.\n\nOnly in December of 2022 did scientists at the National Ignition Facility at\nthe Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory announce that they had achieved the\nfirst recorded fusion reaction with a net energy gain \u2013 meaning that it\nreleased more energy than was put in, which was a crucial milestone for the\nwhole field, though it could be decades before this is put into practical use.\n\nThe energy crisis of the 1970s motivated the U.S. government to throw lots of\nmoney at alternative energy sources, and fusion was one of the big areas of\ninterest.\n\nAccording to the Department of Energy, the basic principle of nuclear fusion\nis the fusion of two lighter nuclei (such as the commonly used combo of\ndeuterium and tritium) to form a heavier one (helium) which releases energy\n(and subatomic particles, such as neutrons). To do this, super-hot plasma is\ncreated in a vacuum to create the fusion reaction, and either lasers or\npowerful magnets are used to control and contain the plasma.\n\nDuring this period of frenzied investment in the 70\u2019s, two major directions\nfor fusion research emerged: the torus or donut shaped \u201cTokamak\u201d design\nutilized by Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, and MFTF-B's \u201cmagnetic\nmirror\u201d based approach, with a linear vessel housing the superheated plasma\nbouncing the plasma off two opposing magnetic \u201cmirrors\u201d at either end of the\nchamber.\n\n1975 photo of the Princeton Large Torus at the Princeton Plasma Physics\nLaboratory, which is an example of a \"tokamak\" fusion reactor design. Source:\nPrinceton Plasma Physics Laboratory, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nResearch at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory developing the mirror based\napproach showed promise in smaller scale tests, which led to the decision to\ngo all in on a large scale device. The fact that other major labs were going\nall in on the tokamak approach, left an opening for hedging the big fusion bet\non this potential alternate path. The question of whether there was enough\nsound evidence to ramp up to the scale of the MFTF-B was subject to debate at\nthe time, and the final decision seemed to partly come down to ideology and\ngut instinct.\n\nIn a really thorough 1987 Science magazine story on the MFTF-B Edwin Kintner,\nwho was the associate director of the Department of Energy\u2019s Office of Energy\nResearch at the time said as much. Looking back on the decision to go all in\non the MFTF-B, Kintner is quoted as saying \u201cEverybody was concentrating on\ntokamaks. I thought it was necessary for these tokamak guys to have to look\nover their shoulders.\u201d\n\nIn the same article, MFTF-B program director Fowler is quoted as saying, \u201cYou\ncould debate the decision, but it wasn\u2019t illogical. Building big machines is a\nmixture of lead times, resources, prudence and gambling.\u201d\n\nBelow: \"Mirror Fusion Test Facility magnet system\u2014 Final design report. Sept.\n3, 1980.

Lawmakers tried to fight for extra funds to throw a\nlifeline to the program or to salvage parts of the project to perform some\nscience in a more limited scope. The money and time spent on the project was\nweighing heavy in the comments recorded in hearings held by the House\nSubcommittee on Energy Research and Production in February of 1986.\n\nCongressman Fortney (\"Pete\") Stark of California made a particularly\nimpassioned plea to extend the life of the project. Citing the Reagan\nAdministration's proposed budget, Stark wrote \"This proposal would mothball\nthe just-completed and never-used Mirror Fusion Test Facility-B (MFTF-B) at\nthe Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.\" Stark continued, \"A lot of hard\nwork and money has been invested in the world's largest superconducting,\ntandem mirror fusion experiment. For close to 8 years some of the finest\nscientists and engineers in America have dedicated their time and energy to\nthe project. $350 million dollars have been invested in MFTF-B.\"\n\nThe MFTF-B under construction in 1983.

Even to those who have not had years of scientific training,\nthe enormous complexity of the project can be appreciated. Please let me\nrepeat: 8 years of dedicated manpower and $350 million dollars have been\npumped into the MFTF-B.\"\n\nIn the years following the shutdown of the program, parts of the machine were\nscavenged for other projects, and the rest was scrapped in 1998. Building 431\nat Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory sat empty for a number years and was\neventually demolished around 2005 after determining that the site did not meet\nthe threshold of historical significance to be protected on the National\nRegister of Historic Places.\n\nThe installation of a magnet into the MFTF-B in 1981.

In fact, the successful ignition employed another huge, expensive\nmachine \u2013 this one equipped with 192 massive lasers all focused on a tiny\npellet, pounding it with 2 million joules of energy, creating a fusion\nreaction that only lasted for 100 trillionths of a second.\n\n\"Crossing this threshold is the vision that has driven 60 years of dedicated\npursuit \u2014 a continual process of learning, building, expanding knowledge and\ncapability, and then finding ways to overcome the new challenges that emerged.\nThese are the problems that the U.S. national laboratories were created to\nsolve.\u201d\n\nAnother huge, expensive fusion machine.
