April 18, 2024 at 6:05 am 17\n\nThe Future of Humanity Institute (FHI) at the University of Oxford closed\nearlier this week.\n\nThe FHI was an interdisciplinary research group founded in 2005 by philosopher\nNick Bostrom, who served as its director for its entire existence. He will now\nbe leaving Oxford.\n\nThe closure of the FHI appears to be the result of decisions by Oxford\u2019s\nFaculty of Philosophy. A statement on the FHI website says:\n\nOver time FHI faced increasing administrative headwinds within the Faculty of\nPhilosophy (the Institute\u2019s organizational home).\n\nA \u201cfinal report\u201d on the FHI by Anders Sandberg provides a little more detail:\n\nWhile FHI had achieved significant academic and policy impact, the final years\nwere affected by a gradual suffocation by Faculty bureaucracy. The flexible,\nfast-moving approach of the institute did not function well with the rigid\nrules and slow decision-making of the surrounding organization. (One of our\nadministrators developed a joke measurement unit, \u201cthe Oxford\u201d. 1 Oxford is\nthe amount of work it takes to read and write 308 emails. This is the actual\nadministrative effort it took for FHI to have a small grant disbursed into its\naccount within the Philosophy Faculty so that we could start using it\u2014after\nboth the funder and the University had already approved the grant.)\n\nStarting in 2020, the Faculty imposed a freeze on fundraising and hiring.\nUnfortunately, this led to the eventual loss of lead researchers and\nespecially the promising and diverse cohort of junior researchers, who have\ngone on to great things in the years since. While building an impressive\nalumni network and ecosystem of new nonprofits, these departures severely\nreduced the Institute. In late 2023, the Faculty of Philosophy announced that\nthe contracts of the remaining FHI staff would not be renewed. On 16 April\n2024, the Institute was closed down.\n\nThe reasons the Faculty of Philosophy told the FHI to stop hiring and\nfundraising have not been made public. It\u2019s not clear whether it is related to\npersonnel or administrative issues, shifts in funding priorities,\ndissatisfaction with the research focus of the FHI, or something else\naltogether. (Please avoid speculation about this in the comments.)\n\nThe website statement summarizes that research focus:\n\nFHI was involved in the germination of a wide range of ideas including\nexistential risk, effective altruism, longtermism, AI alignment, AI\ngovernance, global catastrophic risk, grand futures, information hazards, the\nunilateralist\u2019s curse, and moral uncertainty. It also did significant work on\nanthropics, human enhancement ethics, systemic risk modeling, forecasting and\nprediction markets, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, and on the\nattributes and strategic implications of key future technologies. One major\ncontribution was in showing that it was even possible to do rigorous research\non big picture questions about humanity\u2019s future.\n\nThe report goes into greater detail on this research and its impact, as well\nas the various academic and public-facing activities of scholars at the FHI.\nYou can read it here.\n\nUPDATE (4/18/24): An inquiry to parties at the University of Oxford outside\nthe FHI yielded the following statement:\n\nOxford University has taken the difficult decision to close the Future of\nHumanity Institute, a research centre in the Faculty of Philosophy. The\nInstitute has made an important contribution to the study of the future of\nhumanity, for which we would like to thank and recognise the research team.\nResearchers elsewhere across Oxford University are likely to continue to work\non this emerging field.\n\nWhile this confirms some facts, it doesn\u2019t do much to explain the reasons for\nthe closure. Some insight into those reasons, perhaps, can be gleaned from a\nsection towards the end of FHI\u2019s report:\n\nAny organization embedded in a larger organization or community needs to\ninvest to a certain degree in establishing the right kind of social\nrelationships to maintain this embeddedness. Incentives must be aligned, and\nboth parties must also recognize this alignment. We did not invest enough in\nuniversity politics and sociality to form a long-term stable relationship with\nour faculty. There also needs to be an understanding of how to communicate\nacross organizational communities. When epistemic and communicative practices\ndiverge too much, misunderstandings proliferate. Several times we made serious\nmissteps in our communications with other parts of the university because we\nmisunderstood how the message would be received. Finding friendly local\ntranslators and bridgebuilders is important.\n\nAnother important lesson (which is well known in business and management\neverywhere outside academia) is that as an organization scales up it needs to\norganize itself differently. The early informal structure cannot be maintained\nbeyond a certain size, and must be gradually replaced with an internal\nstructure. Doing this gracefully, without causing administrative sclerosis or\nlack of delegation, is tricky and in my opinion we somewhat failed.\n\nCategories Cuts and Threats to Philosophy Programs\n\nTags futureinstitutionsOxford\n\n9 likes\n\nSubscribe\n\nLogin\n\n17 Comments\n\nOldest\n\nNewest Most Voted\n\nInline Feedbacks\n\nView all comments\n\nMiroslav Imbrisevic\n\n2 days ago\n\nThe punk rockers were right: \u201cNo future!\u201d\n\n13\n\nReply\n\nA Philosopher Named Slickback\n\n2 days ago\n\nBye\n\n13\n\nReply\n\ntoro toro\n\n2 days ago\n\nAt this difficult time for everyone involved, I would like to make it widely\nknown that I will say anything, anything at all, that makes techbros happy in\nexchange for cash.\n\nI don\u2019t even need a castle.

I\u2019m\nsorry to see that\u2019s not the case here.\n\n(This without prejudice as to whether this was a necessary move on Oxford\u2019s\npart \u2013 I suspect the story there is complicated.)\n\n67\n\nReply\n\nBCB\n\nReply to David Wallace\n\n2 days ago\n\nCounterpoint: the FHI was a means by which external funders could give a\ncluster of philosophical views a level of prominence and institutional power\nthat was very disproportionate to their merits, and to the prominence and\ninstitutional power they would have on a more even intellectual playing field.\nWhile it\u2019s sad that good people are losing their jobs, this may not be sad\nnews with respect to the health of the discipline.\n\n(fwiw, this is the first DN post of yours I have not wholeheartedly agreed\nwith!)\n\n22\n\nReply\n\nDavid Wallace\n\nReply to BCB\n\n1 day ago\n\nOne can have sympathy even if one thinks the decision was ultimately correct.\n\nI\u2019m also not convinced that\u2019s a fair statement about FHI, at least initially:\nit leveraged a shoestring budget into a pretty impressive level of influence.\n(I can\u2019t speak to how it evolved in the time since I left Oxford, and even\nwhile I was there I had become much less aware of it later.)\n\n31\n\nReply\n\nDavid Wallace\n\nReply to BCB\n\n1 day ago\n\nOn reflection I should expand on my comment here. FHI was founded in 2005 as a\nhumanities component in the largely-STEM focused Oxford Martin School. Its\ninitial remit, as I recall, was quite amorphous and broad, and shaped by the\npeople it hired. (I was on a couple of its early hiring panels in the\nmid-2000s.) It predates the current Silicon Valley interest in effective\naltruism, longtermism, and AI risk, and indeed played a large role in creating\nthat interest, and those fields themselves. The large-scale funding from tech\nfocused on those areas came later (and indeed one can ask whether in the long\nterm it was in FHI\u2019s interest to be quite so showered in gold). It\u2019s much more\nan advert for the ability of academics to shape elite interest than it is a\ndemonstration of how elite interest shapes the academy (or, again: that was at\nleast true in its earlier period).\n\n47\n\nReply\n\nRichard Y Chappell\n\nReply to BCB\n\n1 day ago\n\nfwiw, I think a lot of extraordinarily interesting, creative, and innovative\nphilosophy came out of FHI. (More than that: I would have thought that this\nwas undeniable.) I guess people vary radically in their philosophical tastes,\nbut \u201cit\u2019s a good thing for the discipline when people I disagree with lose\ntheir jobs\u201d is not an attitude I would generally expect from philosophers.\n\nI\u2019m also dubious of the idea that external funding necessarily disrupts what\nwould otherwise be an \u201ceven intellectual playing field\u201d. Purely \u201cinternal\u201d\ninfluences are different (including fads, social networks, ideologies that\nhappen to be popular amongst the academic elite, etc.), but are not obviously\nmore truth-conducive (or merit-conducive). We can all make judgments about\nacademics whose prominence is disproportionate to their merits (at least as we\njudge them). We all know that academia is far from a perfect meritocracy. So\nit\u2019s at least possible (and, I think, often plausible) that external funding\ncan remedy problems of undue neglect within the academy. (This is presumably\nmore likely when the external funders are well-motivated. But many are. For\nexample, I gather that a major funder for FHI was OpenPhilanthropy: a spinoff\nfrom GiveWell. I\u2019d be hard pressed to think of a more obviously well-motivated\norganization. It\u2019d be a bit like having Doctors Without Borders funding\nmedical research: we could fully expect their priorities to be much better\nthan those that otherwise reign supreme amongst first-world medical\nresearchers!)\n\n51\n\nReply\n\nDavid Wallace\n\nReply to Richard Y Chappell\n\n1 day ago\n\nA weaker version of this would itself suffice to make your point: even if it\nwouldn\u2019t necessarily be a good idea to have Doctors Without Borders\ncontrolling all medical research, at the margin their controlling a chunk of\nit might well be an improvement.\n\n10\n\nReply\n\nBCB\n\nReply to Richard Y Chappell\n\n1 day ago\n\nI think the appeal of this analogy depends on one\u2019s substantive judgments\nabout the views in question: someone who thinks consequentialism is profoundly\nwrongheaded might instead see the case as more similar to the Koch brothers\nfunding reseach in political philosophy.\n\n4\n\nReply\n\nToro toro\n\nReply to David Wallace\n\n1 day ago\n\nYou know what? You\u2019re right.\n\nI thought it was a funny joke about what a lot of people see as the malign and\ndisproportionate influence of the Institute\u2019s funding arrangements. Evidently\nsome people agree.\n\nBut you certainly couldn\u2019t tell from it that I have genuine sympathy for the\npeople who now have to brave a horrid job market. So I shouldn\u2019t have posted\nit.\n\n20\n\nReply\n\nDavid Wallace\n\nReply to Toro toro\n\n1 day ago\n\nKudos. (It actually was a funny joke, fwiw.)\n\n6\n\nReply\n\nJunior faculty\n\nReply to toro toro\n\n1 day ago\n\nThis is my favorite DN comment of all time.\n\n5\n\nReply\n\nDavid Wallace\n\nReply to Junior faculty\n\n1 day ago\n\nI suppose it was always optimistic to hope that people would regret the\nmisfortune of others even when they disagreed with their philosophical views.\n\n28\n\nReply\n\nSam\n\n2 days ago\n\nBostrom, Sandberg and the others have done some incredible and incredibly\nimportant work. This is a really sad loss for philosophy and for Oxford but I\nhope they are proud of what they accomplished already.\n\n59\n\nReply\n\nBmk\n\n8 hours ago\n\nWill GPI remain?\n\n1\n\nReply\n\nDavid Wallace\n\nReply to Bmk\n\n6 hours ago\n\nI don\u2019t have inside information on this issue but I don\u2019t see any reason to\nexpect GPI to go away: I think Oxford\u2019s decision to close FHI probably depends\non quite specific features of the Institute and its relation to the Philosophy\nFaculty, not on any broad move away from supporting this style of research.\n\n1\n\nReply\n\nPaid Advertisements\n\n### Recent Comments\n\nMatt L on Daniel Dennett (1942-2024)\n\nThanks for this - it's very interesting and helpful.
