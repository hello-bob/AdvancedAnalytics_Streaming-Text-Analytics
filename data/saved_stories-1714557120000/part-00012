The goals are similar to that of Intel's more\nrecent One Mono as another open-source font for developers. It's been three\nyears since the last update to the Cascadia Code open-source font while today\nrolled out version 2404.23.\n\nWith today's Cascadia Code 2404.23 release there is now support for 1,140 new\nglyphs with symbols for legacy computing and more. There is also a new native\n\"Nerd Font\" variant.\n\nThat's the brief overview of the Cascadia Code open-source font update.\nMicrosoft's announcement even showcases it using Windows Subsystem for Linux\n(WSL) with Ubuntu under the Windows Terminal:\n\nThose curious for more details on this open-source Microsoft font update can\nsee their Microsoft Developer Blog or head straight over to the downloads on\nGitHub.\n\n1 Comment\n\nRelated News\n\nMicrosoft Open-Sources MS-DOS 4.0 Under MIT License\n\nMicrosoft Helping Out In Making The Linux Kernel Language More Inclusive\n\nMicrosoft Engineer Sends Rust Linux Kernel Patches For In-Place Module\nInitialization\n\nMicrosoft Enables DNS Tunneling By Default For WSL - More Reliable Networking\n\nMicrosoft Better Seeds The RNG For Hyper-V VMs In Linux 6.9\n\nMicrosoft's DirectX Shader Compiler Sees Improved Linux Build Support\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
