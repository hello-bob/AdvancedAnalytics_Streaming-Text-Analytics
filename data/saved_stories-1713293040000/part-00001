The limb was preserved before surgery by using ice. As news of the\nsuccessful operation spread, the use of ice to treat acute injuries became\ncommon.^[4]\n\nThe mnemonic was introduced by Dr. Gabe Mirkin in 1978.^[5] He withdrew his\nsupport of this regimen in 2014 after learning of the role of inflammation in\nthe healing process.^[6] The implementation of RICE for soft tissue injuries\nas described by Dr. Mirkin is no longer recommended, as there is not enough\nresearch on the efficacy of RICE in the promotion of healing.^[2] In fact,\nmany components of the protocol have since been shown to impair or delay\nhealing by inhibiting inflammation.^[2]^[3]^[7] Early rehabilitation is now\nthe recommendation to promote healing.^[3]^[8] Ice, compression, and elevation\nmay have roles in decreasing swelling and pain, but have not shown to help\nwith healing an injury.^[2]^[7]^[9]\n\nThere are different variations of the protocol, which may emphasize additional\nprotective actions. However, these variations similarly lack sufficient\nevidence to be broadly recommended.^[9] Examples include PRICE, POLICE, and\nPEACE & LOVE.^[9]^[10]^[11]^[12]\n\n## Primary four terms[edit]\n\n### Rest[edit]\n\nRest refers to limiting the use of an injured area. It was once recommended to\nrest an injury for up to 2 days or until it was no longer painful to use.^[1]\nIt was intended to reduce inflammation and to prevent further injury.^[2]\nBlood supply is an important component of inflammation. By resting an injury,\nblood flow to the area is reduced, which reduces the swelling and pain\nassociated with inflammation.^[13] The early stages of healing involve\nmicroscopic scaffolding that is built upon to repair an injury. These\nscaffolds are relatively weak until reinforced by later stages of\nhealing.^[14] Early and aggressive movement could potentially disrupt the\nscaffolds, delaying healing or worsen an existing injury.^[2]\n\nAlthough rest may provide some benefit immediately after an injury, returning\nto movement early has been shown to be better at reducing pain and encouraging\nhealing.^[3]^[8]\n\n### Ice[edit]\n\nIce and ElevationIce & Elevate Leg Part 1Ice being applied to a leg propped on\na pillow for elevation  \n---  \n  \nIce refers to the application of cold objects to an injury, such as ice, an\nicepack, frozen vegetables, etc.^[1] It was meant to reduce swelling and\ninflammation by vasoconstriction.^[15] However, adequate blood flow is\nessential in allowing cells and signals from our immune system to reach\ninjured areas. By reducing the entry of these cells and signals to the injury,\nhealing can be delayed, or possibly inhibited.^[7]^[16]^[15]^[17]\n\nThe current research supports the role of ice in temporary pain relief, but\nthere is little evidence supporting the use of ice to aid in healing, or even\nswelling reduction.^[7] Further research is needed to further understand how\nice should be applied. At this time, due to the lack of evidence, there is no\nconsensus on the ideal temperature ranges, time frames, application methods,\nor patient populations when using ice on a soft tissue injury.^[16] Most\nstudies use icing protocols of intermittent 10-20 minute applications, several\ntimes a day for the first few days following an injury.^[7]\n\n### Compression[edit]\n\nCompression refers to wearing bandages, stockings, braces, or similar devices\nto apply pressure over a localized area to reduce swelling and stop\nbleeding.^[1]^[2] The increased pressure pushes fluids into the blood vessels\nto drain away from the area.^[7] The effects of compression on swelling\nreduction are temporary and gravity-dependent.^[18]\n\nAlthough studies have demonstrated the effects of compression on swelling,\nthere is little evidence to support the use of compression to promote\nhealing.^[7]^[9] When considering the use of compression, the evidence\nsupports the use of elastic bandages with Intermittent Pneumatic Compression\n(IPC) to reduce swelling and pain, while improving range of motion.^[2]\n\n### Elevation[edit]\n\nElevation refers to keeping an injury above the level of the heart, such as\npropping up a leg with pillows.^[1] The goal was to reduce swelling by using\ngravity to encourage blood return from the swollen area back to the\nheart.^[18] The reduction in swelling could improve pain by relieving pressure\nfrom the area. The effects of elevation on swelling have been shown to be\ntemporary, as swelling returns when the injured area is no longer\nelevated.^[18]\n\nHowever, at this time there is little evidence to support that elevation\npromotes healing.^[2]\n\n## Current support[edit]\n\nDr. Gabe Mirkin has since recanted his support for the regimen.^[6] In 2015 he\nwrote:\n\n> Coaches have used my 'RICE' guideline for decades, but now it appears that\n> both ice and complete rest may delay healing, instead of helping. The\n> reasoning for this lies within the natural healing process. When an injury\n> is created the body has to go through a very specific sequence to heal said\n> injuries. For the next step the step prior has to be completed. The first\n> step in the sequence is inflammation. If you use ice to reduce inflammation,\n> it is only going to slow the healing process because imflamation needs to be\n> complete for the sequence to keep progressing.^[19] In a recent study,\n> athletes were told to exercise so intensely that they developed severe\n> muscle damage that caused extensive muscle soreness. Although cooling\n> delayed swelling, it did not hasten recovery from this muscle damage.\n\nRest may play a role immediately after an injury, but the evidence supports\nearly mobilization to promote healing.^[9] Due to the inhibitory effects of\nice on mounting a proper inflammatory response, a protocol including extended\napplications of ice could delay the body's attempt at healing.^[16]^[17] While\nit is unclear what the effects of elevation and compression are on the healing\nprocess, reduction of swelling is a transient effect and returns when the\ninjury is returned to a lower, gravity-dependent position.^[2]^[18]\n\nCurrently, the RICE protocol is no longer recommended and has given way to\nother protocols for treating soft tissue injuries. Most recently, in 2019 the\nmnemonic \"PEACE & LOVE\" was coined by Blaise Dubois. The PEACE component\nstands for protection, elevation, avoid anti-inflammatories, compression, and\neducation. It guides the treatment of acute soft tissue injuries. The LOVE\ncomponent stands for load, optimism, vascularization, and exercise. It guides\nthe treatment for the sub-chronic and chronic management of soft tissue\ninjuries.^[12] There is also evidence that points towards using heat to treat\nacute and soft tissue injuries. As stated before, ice is only going to\nrestrict blood flow, and in turn, slow the healing process. The use of heat\nwill open up the blood vessels in the affected area. This will help speed up\nthe healing process as well as reduce the possibility of persistent stagnation\nin the affected area and reduce the risk of future re-injury.^[15]\n\n## Variations[edit]\n\nVariations of the acronym are sometimes used to emphasize additional steps\nthat should be taken. These include:\n\n  * \"PRICE\" \u2013 Protection, Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation^[10]^[11]\n  * \"POLICE\" \u2013 Protection, Optimal Loading, Ice, Compression, and Elevation^[9]\n  * \"PEACE & LOVE\" \u2013 Protection, Elevation, Avoid Anti-inflammatories, Compression, Education & Load, Optimism, Vascularization, Exercise^[12]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Cold compression therapy\n  * Gabe Mirkin\n  * Inflammation\n  * Wound healing\n  * Soft tissue injury\n  * Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c ^d ^e ^f \"Sports Medicine Advisor 2005.4: RICE: Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation for Injuries\".
