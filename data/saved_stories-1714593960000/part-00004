USB hubs are also not well supported yet on Redox OS so there\nis the possibility of issues there too. But they seem to be outpacing GNU Hurd\nwhere at last check they still lacked USB support.\n\nMore details on the recent progress to Redox OS can be found via this month's\nstatus report on Redox-OS.org.\n\n10 Comments\n\nRelated News\n\nLinux Mint Looks To Fork More GNOME Software, Make XApp More Independent\n\nTrueNAS SCALE 24.04 Released For A Wonderful NAS Platform\n\nRocky Linux To Support Upstream Stable Kernels\n\nAlmaLinux 9.4 Beta Restores Support For Some Hardware Deprecated By RHEL\n\nGentoo Linux Now An SPI Project\n\nLinux Mint Aims For More Reliable & Faster Repository Access\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site\nin 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
