LLM-integrated\n> frameworks, which serve as the essential infrastructure, have given rise to\n> many LLM-integrated web apps. However, some of these frameworks suffer from\n> Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to execute\n> arbitrary code on apps' servers remotely via prompt injections. Despite the\n> severity of these vulnerabilities, no existing work has been conducted for a\n> systematic investigation of them. This leaves a great challenge on how to\n> detect vulnerabilities in frameworks as well as LLM-integrated apps in real-\n> world scenarios. To fill this gap, we present two novel strategies,\n> including 1) a static analysis-based tool called LLMSmith to scan the source\n> code of the framework to detect potential RCE vulnerabilities and 2) a\n> prompt-based automated testing approach to verify the vulnerability in LLM-\n> integrated web apps. We discovered 13 vulnerabilities in 6 frameworks,\n> including 12 RCE vulnerabilities and 1 arbitrary file read/write\n> vulnerability. 11 of them are confirmed by the framework developers,\n> resulting in the assignment of 7 CVE IDs. After testing 51 apps, we found\n> vulnerabilities in 17 apps, 16 of which are vulnerable to RCE and 1 to SQL\n> injection. We responsibly reported all 17 issues to the corresponding\n> developers and received acknowledgments. Furthermore, we amplify the attack\n> impact beyond achieving RCE by allowing attackers to exploit other app users\n> (e.g. app responses hijacking, user API key leakage) without direct\n> interaction between the attacker and the victim. Lastly, we propose some\n> mitigating strategies for improving the security awareness of both framework\n> and app developers, helping them to mitigate these risks effectively.\n\nSubjects:| Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2309.02926 [cs.CR]  \n(or arXiv:2309.02926v2 [cs.CR] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2309.02926arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Tong Liu [view email] [v1] Wed, 6 Sep 2023 11:39:37 UTC (1,303 KB) [v2]\nSun, 8 Oct 2023 05:28:14 UTC (1,566 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Demystifying RCE Vulnerabilities in LLM-\nIntegrated Apps, by Tong Liu and 4 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CR\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2309\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
