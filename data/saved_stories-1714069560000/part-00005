I've now reached the point that I wanted to reach to consider my experiment of using MPS in Emacs successful. - Emacs builds from scratch - Tests succeed to a sufficient degree - Emacs starts in GUI mode That's all. There is nothing more. And I'm currently undecided how to proceed with this. To make this credible :-), you can find the sources at https://github.com/gerd-moellmann/emacs-with-cl-packages/tree/igc Please note that this is based on my local Emacs (see Github page). It probably doesn't build/work on anything but macOS, using different Elisp packages than I do, or not using the ones I do :-), and so on. I also regularly force-push, and do other mean things.\n\n[Prev in Thread]| Current Thread| [Next in Thread]  \n---|---|---  \n  \n  * MPS experiment successful, Gerd M\u00f6llmann <=\n\n    * Re: MPS experiment successful, Bj\u00f6rn Bidar, 2024/04/17\n\n      * Re: MPS experiment successful, Bj\u00f6rn Bidar, 2024/04/17\n    * Re: MPS experiment successful, Eli Zaretskii, 2024/04/17\n\n      * Re: MPS experiment successful, Gerd M\u00f6llmann, 2024/04/17\n\n        * Re: MPS experiment successful, Eli Zaretskii, 2024/04/17\n        * Re: MPS experiment successful, Gerd M\u00f6llmann, 2024/04/17\n        * Re: MPS experiment successful, Eli Zaretskii, 2024/04/17\n        * Re: MPS experiment successful, Gerd M\u00f6llmann, 2024/04/17\n        * Re: MPS experiment successful, Eli Zaretskii, 2024/04/17\n        * Re: MPS experiment successful, Gerd M\u00f6llmann, 2024/04/17\n\n  * Prev by Date: Re: master a33ab7565e2: track-changes.el: Minor changes for version 1.0\n  * Next by Date: Re: MPS experiment successful\n  * Previous by thread: Re: master a33ab7565e2: track-changes.el: Minor changes for version 1.0\n  * Next by thread: Re: MPS experiment successful\n  * Index(es):\n\n    * Date\n    * Thread\n\n", "frontpage": false}
