Valorant now takes screenshots of your PC, They are\nactually able to screenshot discord chats and fullscreen any window without\nyou knowing and uploading it to their servers.\u201d\n\nUser @KiiiExe would post to X to keep the cloak-and-dagger rumor mill going at\nfull speed, saying \u201cNot only does Vanguard send screenshots of your computer\ndaily, they also monitor your clipboard and ur recycling bin. Extremely\nillegal.\u201d\n\nThis caused Riot Game\u2019s Development Team and their Head of Anti-Cheat, Phillip\nKoskinas Aka @deteccphilippe to speak out in response to @KaiiExe, curtly\nsaying:\n\n> Nope. Vanguard doesn't monitor your clipboard or your recycling bin.\n>\n> We only take screenshots of the game window when you're in game, just like\n> every other anti-cheat.\n>\n> \u2014 Phillip Koskinas (@deteccphilippe) May 2, 2024\n\nFurther down the thread of social media posts, Koskinas would respond to other\nquestions, such as @NotKarou asking \u201cWould Riot ever consent to a trusted 3rd\nparty analysis of Vanguard? Like sign a contract that says you can\u2019t disclose\nthe source code or any of the secrets but broad strokes? I don\u2019t really care\neither way but I know a lot of people do for some reason.\u201d\n\nKoskinas said \u201cYes. We had this done in 2020, and we plan to do it again this\nyear. Think the difficulty is in having anyone trust the results.\u201d\n\nTrust seems to be a key issue for the developer, but their stance has been\nstrong on the use of the system and its validity. It remains to be seen if the\nbustling communities of League of Legends and Valorant believe the 3rd party\nanalysis.\n\n### What is Vanguard?\n\nVanguard, Riot Game\u2019s proprietary security software, operates silently in the\nbackground of the FPS experience. It is intended to uphold security and data\nprivacy as a priority. Riot\u2019s statement on Protecting Player Data isn\u2019t the\nmost up-to-date though, as it was published in June 2019:\n\n\u201cOur commitment to safety includes our commitment to your privacy. Riot\nVanguard was made with Riot Games\u2019 dedication to data privacy specifically in\nmind, and we worked with our legal and compliance teams to ensure it adheres\nto regional data privacy laws,\u201d says the developer.\n\nMany players see this mandatory software client that ghosts in between the\ngames as a hindrance, more than a help. Riot on the other hand is stern,\nsaying \u201cTo ensure the integrity of players\u2019 games, Riot Vanguard must be\nactive during VALORANT gameplay,\u201d\n\nFeatured Image: AI-Generated by Ideogram\n\n#### About ReadWrite\u2019s Editorial Process\n\nThe ReadWrite Editorial policy involves closely monitoring the tech industry\nfor major developments, new product launches, AI breakthroughs, video game\nreleases and other newsworthy events.
