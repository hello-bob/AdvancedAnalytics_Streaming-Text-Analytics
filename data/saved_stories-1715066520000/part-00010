That\u2019s kinda the point\nof Monte Carlo integration. If you want systematic coverage, you can/must\nsample systematically, and that\u2019s impractical in high dimensions.\n\nBob gives the example that if you want to get one integration point in each\nquadrant of a 20-dimensional space, you need a million samples. (2^20 to be\nprecise.) But you may be able to get sufficiently accurate results with a lot\nless than a million samples.\n\nIf you wanted to be certain to have one sample in each quadrant, you could\nsample at (\u00b11, \u00b11, \u00b11, ..., \u00b11). But if for some weird reason you wanted to\nsample randomly and hit each quadrant, you have a coupon collector problem.\nThe expected number of samples to hit each of N cells with uniform [1] random\nsampling is\n\nN( log(N) + \u03b3 )\n\nwhere \u03b3 is Euler\u2019s constant. So if N = 2^20, the expected number of draws\nwould be over 15 million.\n\n## Related posts\n\n  * The coupon collector problem and \u03c0\n  * Collecting a large number of coupons\n  * Consecutive coupon collector problem\n\n[1] We\u2019re assuming each cell is sampled independently with equal probability\neach time.
