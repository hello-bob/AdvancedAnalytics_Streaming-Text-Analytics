The analogy of maxing out the nation\u2019s\ncredit card has been repeated by other Shadow ministers. Rachel Reeves, Shadow\nChancellor, has joined many Conservative ministers in saying there is no\n\u2018magic money tree\u2019.\n\nAnyone who knows any macroeconomics understands that these analogies are\nfalse. The nation does not have a credit card with an externally imposed\ncredit limit that it can \u2018max out\u2019, and the UK government does have a magic\nmoney tree because it can create money. But are those of us who do know some\n(or rather a lot) of macroeconomics getting a bit pedantic in worrying about\npoliticians who use these phrases for rhetorical flourish? After all,\nanalogies are usually inexact, and if using inexact analogies gets across\npoints to a lay audience why worry about this inexactitude?\n\nImagine, for example, if we forced politicians to be more precise. Rather than\nclaiming that the government had \u2018run out of money\u2019 and \u2018maxed out its credit\ncard\u2019, they would instead have to say that the government had almost hit their\nself-imposed borrowing limits. Rather than saying you couldn\u2019t promise to\nspend this or reduce that tax because there is no magic money tree,\npoliticians instead would say need to say that the government could create\nmore money or borrow more, but that would add to aggregate demand which would\nrisk higher inflation and so force the Bank of England to raise interest\nrates. You can see why speech writers, and authors of lines to take, prefer\ntalking about credit cards and money trees, things most people can relate to\nthat don\u2019t involve macroeconomics.\n\nNow of course those who know some macroeconomics will say that these false\nanalogies were used by a Conservative government to persuade first the media\nand then voters to embark on the ruinous policy commonly known as austerity\nthat began in 2010. But surely today\u2019s Labour politicians would argue that\npurpose matters, and if these false analogies can be used for good, to finally\nget the party that imposed austerity out of office, why not embrace it. Use\nthe enemies\u2019 weapons against them.\n\nIndeed, those who complain about politicians using these false analogies are\nin danger of being hypocritical. After all, the word austerity was originally\nused to describe the post-WWII situation in the UK, where rationing continued\nand didn\u2019t finally end until the mid-1950s. Wasn\u2019t co-opting that term to\ndescribe some (any?) cuts in government spending just the kind of rhetorical\ninexactitude involved in talking about magic money trees and national credit\ncards? Doesn\u2019t using the term austerity create all kinds of difficulties. For\nexample, is cutting government spending during a boom \u2018austerity\u2019? Are tax\nincreases in a recession an austerity policy?.\n\nOK, enough of playing devil\u2019s advocate. I want to set out here why I think\nit\u2019s important for people in the public domain to avoid false analogies, and\nin particular the false analogies discussed above. Let me start with the money\ntree, which any government with its own central bank has. Furlough during the\npandemic was to a considerable extent financed by the Bank of England creating\nmoney (by creating what are called bank reserves). More generally, if a\ngovernment really wants to do something it can, by creating money or\nborrowing. That is why money was borrowed or created during the pandemic.\n\nSo why do politicians say there is no money tree at their disposal? Because\nthey don\u2019t like telling the truth, which is that they don\u2019t want to break\ntheir fiscal rule, or they don\u2019t want the additional spending or tax cut\nadding to aggregate demand and leading the central bank to raise interest\nrates. That is a trade-off where many voters might take a different view, so\nit is much easier for them to say there is no money. It is a way of disguising\na political choice, and not being honest about these choices.\n\nSo \u2018there is no magic money tree\u2019 is normally said by Chancellors or Prime\nMinisters who want an easy excuse for not spending money or cutting taxes. It\nis a straightforward deception to give politicians an easier life, and\ntherefore it is difficult to defend its use. The phrase \u2018maxing out the\nnation\u2019s credit card\u2019 is more often used by politicians attacking the\nborrowing record of others. Yet it too suggests politicians have less choice\nthan they actually have. In this case it perpetuates the idea that governments\ncan only borrow so much, and that they are currently hitting that limit.\n\nThis is nonsense. There is a limit to how much UK governments can borrow, but\nit is way above levels of debt ever historically recorded. (Debt was 2.7 times\nGDP after WWII.) [1] But it sounds more dramatic to say a government has maxed\nout its credit card than to say it is leaving insufficient headroom to meet\nits own fiscal rules. In the case of 2010 austerity, talking about maxing out\nthe nations cedit card was a way of frightening people into believing it was\nmore important to cut the deficit than help a fragile economic recovery. So\nagain we have politicians deliberately misleading for political gain.\n\nIt really shouldn\u2019t matter whether the politicians in question are those you\nsupport or not, when what they are doing is just wrong. Saying it is for a\ngood cause is a poor excuse. Would you support a politician lying if it was\nfor a good cause? What about the claim of hypocrisy by those happy to use the\nterm austerity? I have some sympathy with that, and where the meaning is\nambiguous I try to be clear about what I mean by the term. But co-opting an\nold word for something new is not the same as using false analogies, and there\nis not a huge difference between restricting parts of private consumption\n(1940/50s rationing) and restricting the consumption of public goods.\n\nThe use of these false analogies probably wouldn\u2019t matter too much if we had\nan informed and informing media that was quick to correct these attempts to\nmislead. Unfortunately the complete opposite is the case. Because much of the\nmedia views macroeconomics as too complex and boring for its viewers, it laps\nup these incorrect attempts to relate fiscal policy to household budgets. I\nhave discussed this at length in my book and many posts over the last twelve\nyears.\n\nSometimes this media environment gives politicians little choice but to\nfollow. But that is not the case with phrases like \u2018no magic money tree\u2019 and\n\u2018maxing out the nation\u2019s credit card\u2019. No one is forcing politicians to use\nthese phrases. Instead it is their own choice to do so. If they know they are\nfalse analogies that just mislead the public they shouldn't use them. If they\ndon\u2019t know that they are false, I'm afraid that is even worse.\n\n[1] People will stop lending to a government that can create its own money if\nthey think that government will choose to default (or if they think the\ngovernment will direct the central bank to substantially increase inflation).\nThat in turn happens when the political cost of raising taxes to pay the\ninterest on debt exceeds the considerable political cost of default. Some of\nthese issues are discussed in a paper by Corsetti and Dedola that I discussed\nhere\n\nPosted by\n\nMainly Macro at\n\n09:06\n\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest\n\n#### No comments:\n\n#### Post a Comment\n\nUnfortunately because of spam with embedded links (which then flag up warnings\nabout the whole site on some browsers), I have to personally moderate all\ncomments.
