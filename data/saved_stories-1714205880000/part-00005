These concerns culminated in two executive orders and the invocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) by the Trump administration in 2019 and 2020. Following a court challenge to the ban, the Biden administration took a different approach with Executive Order 14032 which aimed to mitigate \u201cunnecessary risk\u201d of Chinese social media apps.\n  * Analysis of legislative proposals: In this paper, Rinehart details how legislation aiming to ban TikTok has either focused on amending IEEPA or engaging the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to create another process. The proposed legislation thus far has been the ANTI-SOCIAL CCP Act which would give the president authority to prohibit the import of nonphysical goods which would open the door for a TikTok ban. And the RESTRICT Act, would give the Secretary of Commerce the authority to review transactions made by foreign entities who offer information and communications technologies. Rinehart notes that although federal legislation has stalled, state legislatures have acted.\n  * Nuance for handling TikTok is necessary: Policymakers should think deeply about the costs and benefits of a TikTok ban. As of now, there are potential harms to keeping TikTok in the US market such as an increased chance of CCP influence. Rinehart highlights the first amendment issues inherent in current proposals and articulates that the most effective approach for handling national security issues related to TikTok may not be an outright ban. One of the benefits of keeping TikTok in the US is having soft influence on one of the most valuable tech companies in the world.\n\n#### Resources\n\n  * Download PDF\n\n#### Related Publications\n\n  * Are \u2018Killer Acquisitions\u2019 by Tech Giants a Real Threat to Competition?\n  * Keeping Kids Safe Online: How Should Policymakers Approach Age Verification?\n  * Is Common Carriage a Good Framework for Social Media Platforms?\n\n#### Related News\n\n  * \u201cDid Biden reverse the TikTok ban because Trump did it?\u201d\n  * TV: Tick-Tock for TikTok?\n  * Op-ed: Don\u2019t Ban TikTok Before A Public Trial\n\n#### Related Blogs\n\n  * Antitrust can\u2019t fix social media bias\n  * Are Utah\u2019s social media bills the path forward?\n  * The Problems of Teen Suicide and Self-Harm Predate Social Media\n\n#### Focuses\n\n  * Technology and Innovation\n\n## Introduction\n\nLast year, it seemed as though TikTok would get shut down.\n\nIn the first couple of weeks in January, at the beginning of a new legislative\nsession, 10 different states banned TikTok from government mobile\ndevices.^1There are some exceptions to this rule. By the end of the\nlegislative calendar, which for most states was the summer, 34 state\ngovernments had gotten in on the action.^2The author\u2019s compilation of state\nTikTok bans can be viewed here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gA4Xu394reZe01X_6hLBovuPAFy8Ygxydpd9vg-\nLOg4/edit?usp=sharing.\n\nMontana went the furthest with a bill banning the app for all Montanans. But\nthat bill is now tied up in the courts. In Congress, six bills were filed that\neither narrowly focused on TikTok or could include an outright ban of the app.\nThe volume in Congress has lowered because there has been a tonal shift.\n\nThere has been a dramatic change of fortune for TikTok. People are much less\nsure about banning the app than they were in March. Support for banning the\napp dropped from 50 percent in March to 38 percent at the beginning of\nOctober, according to Pew.^3Colleen McClain, \u201cA Declining Share of Adults, and\nFew Teens, Support a U.S. TikTok Ban,\u201d Pew Research Center, December 11, 2023,\nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/12/11/a-declining-share-of-\nadults-and-few-teens-support-a-us-tiktok-ban/. Opinion is split three ways.\n\nThis paper aims to document TikTok\u2019s moment in the spotlight, charting its\nrise in prominence and its recent legal troubles. Only with this context can\nthe most important public policy questions be answered: What risks, if any,\ndoes TikTok pose? How would a ban work in practice? What other options are\navailable? And most important of all, is any of this even constitutional?\n\nPeople are worried that TikTok could come under the sway of the Chinese\nCommunist Party (CCP) and fundamentally undermine national security. While\nthere have been troubling reports of improper access to user data, so far\nadministration officials have cited speculative harms. Banning TikTok would be\na dramatic shift in policy and one that would run afoul of long-standing free\nspeech principles.^4TikTok, \u201cCelebrating Our Thriving Community of 150 Million\nAmericans,\u201d March 21, 2023, https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/150-m-us-users.\nTikTok serves 150 million people in the United States and is clearly a forum\nfor the expression of speech.\n\nFor its own part, TikTok maintains an uneasy relationship with the CCP. When\nprotests again sprung up in Hong Kong in 2020, TikTok shut down its Hong Kong\noperations. TikTok has reinstated videos that have been critical of the CCP,\nhas been cooperative with US regulators, and has spent $1.5 billion to secure\nuser data. Altogether, these actions have caused a backlash in China, where\nthe founder is routinely called \u201ca traitor of China, a coward, and an American\napologist.\u201d^5Rita Liao, \u201cChinese Internet Users Brand ByteDance CEO a\n\u2018Traitor\u2019 as TikTok Seeks US Buyer,\u201d TechCrunch, August 3, 2020,\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/chinese-netizens-criticize-bytedance-ceo/.\n\nWhat separates the United States from China is that we rely on open debate and\ndue process. Thoughtful, targeted responses are needed, not blanket bans.\nGiven that free speech is concerned, policymakers should consider alternative\noptions that would be less restrictive than a ban or even a forced\ndivestiture.\n\nTikTok might be in legal limbo, but it is not in policy limbo. Policymakers\nshould normalize what is already the reality: TikTok\u2019s Committee on Foreign\nInvestment in the United States (CFIUS) review should be conditionally\nallowed, subject to an audit. Besides, rather than outright prohibitions that\nconflict with free speech values, policymakers should choose rigorous\noversight and transparency.\n\n## A History of TikTok\n\nTikTok is actually a copycat of an app called Musical.ly. Musical.ly was\nfounded in 2014 by Alex Zhu and Luyu Yang because of a train ride that Zhu\ntook from San Francisco to Mountain View, California.^6Paige Leskin, \u201cThe Life\nof TikTok Head Alex Zhu, the Musical.ly Cofounder in Charge of Gen Z\u2019s Beloved\nVideo-Sharing App,\u201d Business Insider, November 24, 2019,\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-head-alex-zhu-musically-china-life-\nbio-2019\u201311. Zhu caught sight of a typical scene: a bunch of teens huddled\ntogether, some jamming to tunes, lost in the music, others snapping away,\ntheir screens a flurry of pictures and emoji. Zhu wondered if an app built\naround lip-syncing videos might be popular. Thirty days later, the app was up\nand running, and Zhu traveled back to China to found the company in Shanghai,\nChina.^7Leskin, \u201cLife of TikTok Head.\u201d\n\nThe company launched in two markets, China and the United States. Quickly the\napp found an audience in the United States but faltered in China. Eventually\nMusical.ly pulled its Chinese product and focused on the United States.\n\nSeeing the success of Musical.ly in the United States, China\u2019s ByteDance,\nalready a titan in the tech industry, launched two copycat services toward the\nend of 2016 to compete. In China, ByteDance launched Douyin. For the United\nStates, Europe, and the rest of the world, ByteDance created TikTok.^8Joe Tidy\nand Sophia Smith Galer, \u201cTikTok: The Story of a Social Media Giant,\u201d BBC,\nAugust 5, 2020, https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53640724. It didn\u2019t take\nlong for Douyin to explode in popularity, sweeping up 100 million users in\nChina and Thailand alone in just its first year.^9Thomas Graziani, \u201cHow Douyin\nBecame China\u2019s Top Short-Video App in 500 Days,\u201d WalkTheChat, July 30, 2018,\nhttps://walkthechat.com/douyin-became-chinas-top-short-video-app-500-days/.\n\nFor a time, TikTok and Musical.ly competed in the United States, and\nMusical.ly was winning.^10Biz Carson, \u201cHow One Small Design Tweak Rocketed\nThis Startup to No. 1 in the App Store,\u201d Business Insider, June 7, 2016,\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/how-musically-became-so-successful-2016\u20136. At\nits peak, the app had 100 million monthly users.^11Dami Lee, \u201cThe Popular\nMusical.ly App Has Been Rebranded as TikTok,\u201d The Verge, August 2, 2018,\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2018/8/2/17644260/musically-rebrand-tiktok-bytedance-\ndouyin. But within a year of going live with TikTok, ByteDance made a formal\noffer to buy out Musical.ly. In November 2017, Musical.ly agreed to be\nacquired for $1 billion.^12Liza Lin and Rolfe Winkler, \u201cSocial-Media App\nMusical.ly Is Acquired for as Much as $1 Billion,\u201d Wall Street Journal,\nNovember 9, 2017, https://www.wsj.com/articles/lip-syncing-app-musical-ly-is-\nacquired-for-as-much-as-1-billion-1510278123.\n\nThe merger made sense for both parties. Musical.ly was facing a growth problem\nat the time, as the number of new users was plateauing.^13Carson, \u201cHow One\nSmall Design Tweak.\u201d And TikTok was floundering in the United States. So when\nByteDance took over, it shifted over users from Musical.ly to TikTok and\nstarted pumping resources into TikTok to drive its growth. One arm of this\nstrategy involved massive ad spending. At one point in 2018, the company spent\n$3 million per day on acquisition marketing in the United States alone,\ntotaling $1 billion at year\u2019s end.^14Eric Benjamin Seufert, \u201cTikTok\u2019s Billion-\nDollar Secret That Wasn\u2019t,\u201d Mobile Dev Memo, September 14, 2022,\nhttps://mobiledevmemo.com/tiktoks-billion-dollar-secret-that-wasnt/. Some 80\npercent of that ad spending went to its US competitor Snap.^15Alyssa Clementi,\n\u201cReport: TikTok Spent 80 Per Cent of Its US Ad Spend on Snapchat in 2019,\u201d\nMobile Marketing, March 16, 2020,\nhttps://www.mobilemarketingmagazine.com/report-tiktok-spent-80-per-cent-of-\nits-us-ad-spend-on-snapchat-in-2019.\n\nSnap CEO Evan Spiegel recently commented that this part of the business plan\nseemed \u201cunimaginable\u2014no startup could afford to invest billions and billions\nand billions of dollars in user acquisition like that around the world.\u201d\nSpiegel continued, \u201cIt was a totally different strategy than any technology\ncompany had expected before because it wasn\u2019t an innovation-led strategy; it\nwas really about subsidizing large-scale user acquisition.\u201d^16Alexandra S.\nLevine, \u201cTikTok\u2019s Secret to Explosive Growth? \u2018Billions and Billions of\nDollars\u2019 Says Snap CEO Evan Spiegel,\u201d Forbes, September 8, 2022,\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/alexandralevine/2022/09/08/tiktok-evan-spiegel-\nsnap-sundar-pichai-google-code-conference/?sh=2f5734b06995.\n\nThe strategy of massive ad buying was coupled with sweeping changes of the\nalgorithm that drove growth. ByteDance employs an unusually large number of\nsoftware engineers even for a tech company. About half of the company is made\nup of people working on the problem of algorithms.^17Eugene Wei, \u201cTikTok and\nthe Sorting Hat,\u201d EugeneWei.com, August 4, 2020,\nhttps://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2020/8/3/tiktok-and-the-sorting-hat. ByteDance\nhad success with the algorithm-driven app Toutiao for news and then with\nDouyin in China. This brute-force method of bettering the algorithm was then\napplied to TikTok to resounding success.\n\nApplying the engine behind ByteDance to TikTok \u201cabstracted that problem away,\u201d\nas Eugene Wei explained.^18Wei, \u201cTikTok and the Sorting Hat.\u201d He continued:\n\n> That, more than anything else, was the critical upgrade Bytedance applied to\n> Musical.ly to turn it into TikTok. Friends at Bytedance claimed, with some\n> pride, that after they plugged Musical.ly, now TikTok, into Bytedance\u2019s\n> back-end algorithm, they doubled the time spent in the app. I was skeptical\n> until I asked some friends who had some data on the before and after. The\n> step change in the graph was anything but subtle.\n\nTo outsiders and many of those who use it, TikTok seems to knows our innermost\nthoughts.^19Jia Tolentino, \u201cHow TikTok Holds Our Attention,\u201d New Yorker,\nSeptember 23, 2019, https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/09/30/how-tiktok-\nholds-our-attention. As one writer explained, \u201cThe TikTok algorithm is smart.\nOr, at least, I think it is.\u201d^20Amalie MacGowan, \u201cThe TikTok Algorithm Knew My\nSexuality Better than I Did,\u201d Repeller.com, July 8, 2020,\nhttps://repeller.com/tiktok-algorithm-bisexual/. In reality, the TikTok\nalgorithm is the result of attacking a complex problem with lots of people.\nJulian McAuley, a seasoned computer science professor at the University of\nCalifornia San Diego, dispelled the myth, noting that \u201cthere seems to be some\nperception (by the media? or the public?) that they\u2019ve cracked some magic code\nfor recommendation, but most of what I\u2019ve seen seems pretty normal.\u201d^21Ben\nSmith, \u201cHow TikTok Reads Your Mind,\u201d New York Times, December 5, 2021,\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/05/business/media/tiktok-algorithm.html.\n\nThe algorithm is scrutable. Behind the scenes, it\u2019s a combination of machine\nlearning, user-engagement metrics, and content analysis that drives the\nplatform. While the exact weightings and nuances of these factors may be\nproprietary to TikTok, the general principles are not revolutionary or\nunknowable. Given the right circumstances and permissions, a comprehensive\naudit could shed light on the inner workings of this system.\n\n## Trump\u2019s Executive Order on TikTok\n\nThe legal foundations for Trump\u2019s executive order on TikTok were laid a year\nearlier. On May 15, 2019, the Trump administration issued Executive Order\n13873, which declared that the widespread use of communications networks could\nbe exploited by foreign adversaries and thus posed a threat to national\nsecurity.^22Exec. Order No. 13,873, 84 Fed. Reg. 22689 (2019). While it was\ninitially used to target Huawei, this executive order was the groundwork that\nallowed the president to invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers\nAct (IEEPA) in August 2020 and to issue Executive Order 13942 to restrict\nTikTok\u2019s US operations.^23U.S. Library of Congress, Congressional Research\nService, The International Emergency Economic Powers Act: Origins, Evolution,\nand Use, by Christopher A. Casey, Dianne E. Rennack, and Jennifer K. Elsea,\nR45618 (2022); Exec. Order No. 13,942, 85 Fed. Reg. 155 (2020).\n\nThe first official announcement that the White House was considering a ban of\nTikTok came in July 7, 2020, which seemed to coincide with reports that TikTok\nwas in talks with Microsoft to get bought out. Just days before Microsoft was\nset to announce a deal, President Trump slapped down the idea of a domestic\ncompany buying the platform.^24Georgia Wells, Katy Stech Ferek, and Cara\nLombardo, \u201cMicrosoft Is in Talks to Acquire TikTok, as U.S. Considers Banning\nthe App,\u201d Wall Street Journal, July 31, 2020,\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-to-sign-order-demanding-chinas-bytedance-\nto-divest-tiktok-11596219920. He told reporters when the news broke that \u201cas\nfar as TikTok is concerned we\u2019re banning them from the United States. Well, I\nhave that authority. I can do it with an executive order or that,\u201d referring\nto emergency economic powers.\n\nOn August 6, 2020, the White House gave TikTok\u2019s parent company in Beijing,\nByteDance, 45 days to sell off the social media app or face a ban in the\nUnited States.^25\u201cExecutive Order on Addressing the Threat Posed by TikTok,\u201d\nWhite House, August 6, 2020,\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20200807020946/https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-\nactions/executive-order-addressing-threat-posed-tiktok/. Hours later, the\nadministration also dropped an executive order on Tencent, banning the WeChat\napp from phones with a similar deadline.^26\u201cExecutive Order on Addressing the\nThreat Posed by WeChat,\u201d White House, August 6, 2020,\nhttps://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-\naddressing-threat-posed-wechat/.\n\nAs outlined in the executive order, the administration was concerned that\nTikTok could become an arm of the CCP if the company were to (1) censor TikTok\ncontent that could be damaging to the CCP, (2) track federal employees and\nblackmail them, or (3) manipulate the algorithm to distribute propaganda.\n\nStill, TikTok has taken actions to distance itself from the Chinese\ngovernment. Even before the executive order dropped, TikTok had announced that\nit was open to disclosing its algorithms, moderation policies, and data flows\nto regulators for review.^27Kevin Mayer, \u201cFair Competition and Transparency\nBenefits Us All,\u201d TikTok, July 29, 2020, https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-\nus/fair-competition-and-transparency-benefits-us-all. When China began to\ncrack down on Hong Kong, TikTok pulled out of the region because it didn\u2019t\nwant to comply with the censorship and requests for data.^28Sam Byford,\n\u201cTikTok Pulls Out of Hong Kong Due to New Security Law,\u201d The Verge, July 7,\n2020, https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21315637/tiktok-hong-kong-security-\nchinese-government-pompeo-us-ban. The company also reinstated videos\ncondemning Beijing\u2019s crackdown on Muslims, claiming they were wrongfully taken\ndown.^29\u201cTikTok Apologizes for Removing Viral Uighur \u2018Makeup Tutorial,\u2019\u201d Al\nJazeera, November 28, 2019, https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/28/tiktok-\napologises-for-removing-viral-uighur-makeup-tutorial/. In another incident,\nthe Acton Institute ran ads about the crackdowns in Hong Kong, and they were\ntaken down. But once news spread, TikTok reinstated the think tank\u2019s profile\nand the ads the next day.^30Jimmy Quinn, \u201cTikTok Claims Technical Error Led to\nSuspension of Think Tank That Posted about Hong Kong,\u201d National Review, May 4,\n2023, https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/tiktok-claims-technical-error-led-\nto-suspension-of-think-tank-that-posted-about-hong-kong/.\n\nIf the CCP was using TikTok to track US citizens, none of the most blatant\nmethods of accessing unauthorized data, also called exfiltration, were\noccurring.\n\nShortly after the executive order dropped, French security researcher Elliot\nAlderson conducted a deep dive into TikTok\u2019s data logs and found nothing\nunusual, saying, \u201cIn its current state, TikTok doesn\u2019t have a suspicious\nbehavior and is not exfiltrating unusual data.\u201d^31Elliot Alderson, \u201cTikTok:\nLogs, Logs, Logs,\u201d Medium, August 3, 2020,\nhttps://medium.com/@fs0c131y/tiktok-logs-logs-logs-e93e8162647a. He continued,\n\u201cWe would obtain similar results with Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram and\nothers.\u201d^32Alderson, \u201cTikTok.\u201d If CCP officials have access, it stands to\nreason, then the access is through a back door.\n\nIn a thorough look at all of the criticism, Dr. Milton L. Mueller and Dr.\nKarim Farhat of Georgia Tech\u2019s Internet Governance Project found:\n\n  * The app \u201cis not exporting censorship, either directly by blocking material, or indirectly via its recommendation algorithm. Its content policies are governed by market forces.\u201d^33Milton Mueller and Karim Farhat, \u201cTikTok and US National Security,\u201d Internet Governance Project, January 8, 2023, https://www.internetgovernance.org/wp-content/uploads/TikTok-and-US-national-security-3.pdf.\n  * \u201cThe data collected by TikTok can only be of espionage value if it comes from users who are intimately connected to national security functions and use the app in ways that expose sensitive information.\u201d^34Mueller and Farhat, \u201cTikTok and US National Security.\u201d\n  * And importantly, \u201cBecause social media apps publish and share so much data, China does not need to have special legal powers over ByteDance to use TikTok (or any other social media app) to monitor users.\u201d^35Mueller and Farhat, \u201cTikTok and US National Security.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto concluded in 2021 that\n\u201cTikTok\u2019s program features and code do not pose a threat to national\nsecurity.\u201d^36\u201cTikTok and Douyin Explained,\u201d The Citizen Lab, March 22, 2021,\nhttps://citizenlab.ca/2021/03/tiktok-and-douyin-explained/. The Australian\ngovernment also set up an official government task force to look into TikTok\nand found that there was \u201cno reason for us to restrict those applications at\nthis point.\u201d^37Anthony Galloway, \u201c\u2019Buyer Beware\u2019: Prime Minister Says There Is\nNo Case to Ban TikTok,\u201d Syndey Morning Herald, August 5, 2020,\nhttps://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/buyer-beware-prime-minister-says-\nthere-is-no-case-to-ban-tiktok-20200805-p55inl.html.\n\nAlthough US officials have warned about China\u2019s potential for abuse with\nTikTok since 2019, there has been limited evidence that the Chinese government\nhas actually interfered with TikTok\u2019s operations. Some reports suggest that\nengineers in China seem to have backdoor access to American users, but this\npower seems to be utilized sparingly and hasn\u2019t been confirmed.^38Emily Baker-\nWhite, \u201cLeaked Audio from 80 Internal TikTok Meetings Shows That US User Data\nHas Been Repeatedly Accessed from China,\u201d Buzzfeed News, June 17, 2022,\nhttps://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/emilybakerwhite/tiktok-tapes-us-user-\ndata-china-bytedance-access.\n\nThe most damning and direct claims of interference have come from the court\ndocuments of a former employee of ByteDance, Yintao Yu.^39Yu v. Bytedance,\nInc., 3:23-cv-00707, (N.D. Cal.),\nhttps://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66820959/yu-v-bytedance-inc/. In a series\nof filings related to a wrongful-termination suit, Yu alleged that the CCP\nspied on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong in 2018 by using backdoor\naccess to TikTok to identify and monitor the activists\u2019 locations and\ncommunications.^40Yu v. Bytedance, Inc. All of TikTok\u2019s Hong Kong operations\nceased when the new draconian Chinese information law went into effect.\n\nStill, the presence of a backdoor for US users has long been a point of\ndispute. Testifying before Congress, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said that \u201cTikTok\nhas never shared, or received a request to share, US user data with the\nChinese government. Nor would TikTok honour such a request if one were ever\nmade.\u201d Beginning in 2020, ByteDance began erecting technical firewalls to\nlimit this kind of access after it received criticism.^41Chen Du, \u201cExclusive:\nByteDance Cuts Domestic Engineers\u2019 Data Access to TikTok, Other Overseas\nProducts,\u201d PingWest, June 7, 2020, https://en.pingwest.com/a/6875. To quiet\ncritics, TikTok also onshored US data flows via Project Texas, which will be\ndiscussed later. In other words, ByteDance took the extremely rare decision to\nregion-lock internal codebases and data against its own engineers from China\nbeginning in 2020 and has been working since then to bifurcate data\noperations.\n\nForbes also revealed that TikTok has kept highly sensitive financial\ninformation about its prominent stars, including those participating in its\nCreator Fund, on servers based in China. In contrast, earlier this year, CEO\nShou Chew stated to Congress that \u201cAmerican data has always been stored in\nVirginia and Singapore.\u201d^42Alexandra S. Levine, \u201cTikTok Creators\u2019 Financial\nInfo, Social Security Numbers Have Been Stored in China,\u201d Forbes, May 30,\n2023, https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexandralevine/2023/05/30/tiktok-creators-\ndata-security-china/?sh=3fab2f897048.\n\nStill, TikTok hasn\u2019t made any friends in the press, because it has also been\nrecently revealed that the company spied on news organizations. Journalist\nEmily Baker-White has uncovered the misconduct by TikTok and its parent\ncompany, ByteDance.^43Emily Baker-White, \u201cTikTok Owner ByteDance Used a News\nApp on Millions of Phones to Push Pro-China Messages, Ex-Employees Say,\u201d\nBuzzfeed News, July 26, 2022,\nhttps://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/emilybakerwhite/tiktok-bytedance-topbuzz-\npro-china-content. According to a number of people cited in the report,\nByteDance admitted to allegations of spying on journalists, although the\ncompany asserts it was a result of a mishandled leak investigation.^44Emily\nBaker-White, \u201cThe FBI and DOJ Are Investigating ByteDance\u2019s Use of TikTok to\nSpy on Journalists,\u201d Forbes, March 16, 2023,\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/emilybaker-white/2023/03/16/fbi-doj-\ninvestigating-bytedance-tiktok-surveillance-journalists/?sh=4d7ffb23a6fc.\n\nRecently it was reported that the Justice Department, the FBI, and the US\nattorney for the Eastern District of Virginia are investigating ByteDance, the\nparent company of TikTok, for the company\u2019s surveillance of American\ncitizens.^45Glenn Thrush and Sapna Maheshwari, \u201cJustice Dept.

The investigation, which began late last year, seems to have come\nafter ByteDance admitted that its employees inappropriately obtained data on\nAmerican TikTok users, including two reporters and a few of their associates.\nStill, it is difficult to situate these types of incidents. Almost all\nplatforms have had some version of a data leak or breach. The question is\nwhether the individual evidence reflects some systemic problem or is a more\nlimited, isolated incident.\n\n## The TikTok Ban Is Challenged\n\nTwo challenges were filed in court, one by TikTok and ByteDance, and the other\nby a group of TikTok users. The litigation in both cases centered around two\nexceptions to IEEPA. The first is the personal-communication exception, which\nprohibits the president from limiting \u201cany personal communication that does\nnot involve a transfer of anything of value,\u201d such as postal, telegraphic, or\ntelephonic communication. The second is the informational-materials exception,\nalso known as the Berman Amendment, which bars the president from restricting\nmost forms of \u201cinformation or informational materials,\u201d including\npublications, films, posters, photographs, artworks, and news-wire feeds.\n\nIn 1988, Congress passed amendments to IEEPA, authored by Rep. Howard Berman,\nto ensure that American citizens received information from countries that were\nbeing embargoed. These revisions, now called the Berman Amendment, included\nchanges to IEEPA as well as the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, which\ngives the president of the United States the power to oversee or restrict\ntrade in times of war. After the Berman Amendment went into effect, the Office\nof Foreign Assets Control under the US Department of Treasury interpreted this\nexemption narrowly. In response, Berman again led Congress to act. In 1994,\nthe Free Trade in Ideas Act was signed into law. This bill broadened the\nBerman Amendment to include newer and forthcoming electronic mediums. It also\nwas made clear that the president\u2019s emergency sanction powers under IEEPA and\nthe Trading with the Enemy Act cannot be used with regard to any information\nor informational materials, regardless of their format or medium and whether\nthey are intended for personal or commercial use.\n\nCongress today is vastly different from Congress in the late 1980s and into\nthe mid-1990s, when the Berman Amendment was passed. Even still, much of what\nis in the amendments is statutory codifications of First Amendment\nprinciples.^46\u201cRestricting TikTok (Part II): Legislative Proposals and\nConsiderations for Congress,\u201d Congressional Research Service, September 28,\n2023, https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/LSB/LSB10942. In other\nwords, if Berman didn\u2019t exist, it\u2019s still possible that executive action would\nget struck down on First Amendment grounds.\n\nThe plaintiffs asserted that TikTok\u2019s primary function of creating and sharing\nshort-form videos involved transmitting personal communication and\ninformational materials, albeit in a modern format. To sidestep this argument,\nthe Commerce Department limited its restrictions to \u201cbusiness-to-business\ntransactions.\u201d\n\nOn September 27, 2020, the US District Court for the District of Columbia\ngranted TikTok\u2019s case a preliminary injunction, allowing the platform to stay\non app stores run by Apple and Google.^47TikTok Inc. v. Trump, 490 F. Supp. 3d\n73 (D. D. C. 2020). One month later, a district court ruled on the case\nbrought by users and fully blocked the Trump administration\u2019s ban.^48Marland\nv. Trump, 498 F. Supp. 3d 624 (E. D. Pa. 2020). Then, in December 2020, the US\nDistrict Court of the District of Columbia granted a permanent nationwide\ninjunction originally sought by ByteDance.^49TikTok Inc. v. Trump, 507 F.\nSupp. 3d 92 (D. D. C. 2020). Taken together, these cases only affirmed that\nthe exemptions included TikTok.\n\nBoth cases were dropped when President Biden came into office. Plans to force\nthe sale of TikTok\u2019s US operations to Walmart and Oracle were also shelved\nwith the switch of leadership.^50Makena Kelly, \u201cBiden Revokes and Replaces\nTrump Orders Banning TikTok and WeChat,\u201d The Verge, June 9, 2021,\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525953/biden-tiktok-wechat-trump-bans-\nrevoked-alipay. But TikTok continued to work with Oracle for an\naudit.^51Queenie Wong, \u201cOracle Starts Auditing TikTok\u2019s Algorithms amid\nSecurity Concerns,\u201d CNET, August 16, 2022, https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-\nand-software/oracle-starts-auditing-tiktoks-algorithms-amid-security-\nconcerns/. Instead, President Biden replaced President Trump\u2019s executive\norders with Executive Order 14032 on June 9, 2021. This order outlined a\nprocess to mitigate the \u201cunacceptable risk\u201d associated with Chinese social\nmedia apps. It also involved an interagency report within 120 days, federal\nexecutive-action recommendations within 180 days, and ongoing evaluations of\nrisky app transactions by the secretary of commerce. The report still hasn\u2019t\nbeen released.\n\n## The CFIUS process\n\nAround the same time that President Trump started the process to ban TikTok,\nCFIUS opened an investigation of TikTok. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\noversees CFIUS, a committee made up of members from the State, Justice,\nEnergy, and Commerce Departments, among others, that investigates national\nsecurity risks from foreign investments in American firms. CFIUS is a\nsecretive intragovernment committee that has the authority to review any\ntransaction that could result in the control of a US business by a foreign\nperson or entity, regardless of the size or value of the transaction. It also\nhas the power to investigate transactions that have already been completed.\nCFIUS\u2019s legal hook with TikTok came about because ByteDance merged Musical.ly\ninto its existing TikTok app.\n\nCFIUS also grants the president substantial power to act separately from\nCFIUS. If the president deems there is credible evidence suggesting a\ntransaction could jeopardize national security, and such threats are not\nmitigable through other legal means, he or she can forbid or halt such a\ntransaction. A week after the original TikTok executive order was signed,\nPresident Trump issued a divestment order using the power of CFIUS to force\nthe sale of TikTok.^52U.S. President, Proclamation, \u201cOrder of August 14, 2020\nregarding the Acquisition of Musical.ly by ByteDance Ltd.,\u201d Federal Register\n85, no. 161 (August 19, 2020),\nhttps://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020\u201308\u201319/pdf/2020\u201318360.pdf.\n\nTo help stave off this sale and respond to the executive orders, ByteDance\nopened a parallel negotiation with US companies to house data with the\nblessing of the Trump administration.^53Rick Sofield, John Satira, and Olivia\nHinerfeld, \u201cTikTok and Oracle Ink Data-Storage Agreement in Apparent Effort to\nAvoid Further CFIUS Scrutiny,\u201d Vinson & Elkins (blog), June 24, 2022,\nhttps://www.velaw.com/insights/tiktok-and-oracle-ink-data-storage-agreement-\nin-apparent-effort-to-avoid-further-cfius-scrutiny/. As part of this\nagreement, ByteDance would have created a US subsidiary called TikTok Global,\nwhich would have been part-owned by Walmart and Oracle. ByteDance would have\nstill owned 80 percent of the business, but the biggest concession was that it\nagreed to migrate US user data to Oracle servers in the States. Still, it was\nan about-face from the administration, which was vehemently against Microsoft\nor any other domestic firm owning TikTok just weeks before.\n\nTikTok and ByteDance also filed a challenge to the divestment order in\nNovember 2020, arguing that it violated constitutional protections of due\nprocess rights under the Fifth Amendment and the taking of private property\nwithout just compensation. After the transition to the Biden administration,\nTikTok, ByteDance, and the executive branch requested that the court hold the\ncase in abeyance while the parties tried to resolve the issue. At time of\nwriting, this case remains in abeyance.\n\nAll the while, the CFIUS process continued. In the late summer of 2022,\nByteDance, TikTok, and CFIUS were close to an agreement, which would have\ngiven US authorities extensive power over the platform.^54Emily Baker-White,\n\u201cA Draft of TikTok\u2019s Plan to Avoid a Ban Gives the U.S. Government\nUnprecedented Oversight Power,\u201d Forbes, August 21, 2023,\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/emilybaker-white/2023/08/21/draft-tiktok-cfius-\nagreement/?sh=71ed457c112a. That arrangement would have given either the\nDepartment of Justice or the Department of Defense the ability to (1) examine\nTikTok\u2019s US facilities, records, equipment, and servers with minimal or no\nnotice, (2) block changes to the app\u2019s US terms of service, moderation\npolicies, and privacy policy, (2) veto the hiring of any executive involved in\nleading TikTok\u2019s US Data Security organization, (4) order TikTok and ByteDance\nto pay for and subject themselves to various audits, assessments, and other\nreports on the security of TikTok\u2019s US functions, and (5) in some\ncircumstances, require ByteDance to temporarily stop TikTok from functioning\nin the United States\u2014a kill switch.\n\nBut it was around this time that CFIUS\u2019s review of TikTok ground to a halt,\nprimarily because the Department of Justice wanted more.^55Daniel Flatley and\nEmily Birnbaum, \u201cTikTok Security Deal\u2019s Prospects Are Clouded by FBI\u2019s Doubts,\nState Bans,\u201d Yahoo! Finance, December 13, 2023,\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/tiktok-security-deal-prospects-\nclouded-193805911.html. James Lewis, the director of the Strategic\nTechnologies Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies,\ntold Bloomberg last year that ByteDance and CFIUS \u201chad an agreement drafted,\nDOJ and FBI didn\u2019t like it, they didn\u2019t think it was tough enough, so [FBI\ndirector] Wray did the typical Washington thing, which is to take the deal\nback to the table.\u201d^56Flatley and Birnbaum, \u201cTikTok Security Deal\u2019s\nProspects.\u201d\n\nCFIUS has been flexing the power given to it by the 2018 Foreign Investment\nRisk Review Modernization Act, known as FIRRMA. In 2018, despite presenting a\nmitigation proposal to allay concerns over Chinese access to data, the $1.2\nbillion deal between MoneyGram and China\u2019s Ant Financial was blocked. In March\n2019, CFIUS ordered Kunlun Tech to divest Grindr. While nothing official was\never announced, it was reported that data concerns over geolocation, sexual\npreferences, and HIV status sank the deal. Beijing Shiji Information\nTechnology was also forced to divest all interests in StayNTouch based on a\nCFIUS decision. Again, nothing official was ever announced, but it was\nreported that ID-scanning and facial-recognition technology likely raised\nconcerns.\n\nTikTok has said that it has complied with CFIUS\u2019s demands.^57\u201cAbout Project\nTexas,\u201d U.S. Data Security, TikTok, accessed May 25, 2023,\nhttps://usds.tiktok.com/usds-about/. Moreover, ByteDance has suggested that it\nwould be open to the divestiture of TikTok.^58Alex Barinka and Olivia\nCarville, \u201cTikTok Considers Splitting from ByteDance if Deal with U.S. Fails,\u201d\nTime, March 15, 2023, https://time.com/6263011/tiktok-considers-bytedance-\nsplit/. However, the company considers this option to be a last resort and\nwill only go down this road if the company cannot come to an agreement with\nCFIUS and can find a willing buyer.\n\nSome aspects of the 2022 bargain were typical for CFIUS, including the need\nfor audits and the ability to examine TikTok\u2019s US facilities, equipment, and\nservers. But the kill switch and the ability to change moderation policies on\na whim would be dramatic departures.\n\nThe deal would have also forced TikTok US to rely on an executive security\ncommittee that would operate in secrecy from ByteDance. Members of this\ncommittee would be responsible first for protecting the national security of\nthe United States, as defined by the executive branch, and only then for\nmaking the company money. Ama Adams, a managing partner and CFIUS expert at\nRopes & Gray, told Forbes that \u201csetting up a structure that has allegiance to\nthe United States\u2014I\u2019ve never seen language, per se, to that extent.\u201d\n\nIf this reporting is indeed correct, CFIUS would have inserted the executive\ninto content-moderation decisions of one of the biggest platforms in the\nUnited States, embroiling it in thorny free speech issues. Executive agencies\nare already facing the Supreme Court because of the intense pressure that the\nBiden White House placed on Facebook and Instagram to crack down on alleged\nmisinformation.^59Josh Gerstein and Rebecca Kern, \u201cSupreme Court to Decide If\nBiden Admin Illegally Bullied Social Media into Censoring Content,\u201d Politico,\nOctober 20, 2023, https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/20/supreme-court-\nbiden-social-media-covid-00122842. This proposed deal would be an emboldened\nversion of that, giving the government final say in TikTok\u2019s content\ndecisions. It too would spark concerns about governmental censorship or\ndistortion of TikTok\u2019s content.\n\nA CFIUS decision has only ever been challenged in court once.^60Ralls Corp. v.\nComm. on Foreign Inv. in U.S., 758 F.3d 296 (D. C. Cir.2014). That case was\nsettled out of court before the toughest judicial questions could be answered.\nSo, it makes sense that CFIUS has opted to extend the negotiations because\nthere are uncertainties about how a court might rule. Still, the fact that\nCFIUS review is secretive makes it difficult to truly assess whether everyone\nis negotiating in good faith. However, given what has been made public, it\nseems that CFIUS is demanding extensive provisions that go much further than\nwhat is needed.^61Sapna Maheshwari and David McCabe, \u201cFinding a Buyer for\nTikTok May Not Be So Easy,\u201d New York Times, March 16, 2023,\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/16/business/media/tiktok-buyer-biden.html.\n\n## Legislation in the US Congress\n\nIn Congress, legislation aimed at banning TikTok has tended to focus on either\namending the IEEPA or layering on another CFIUS-like process.\n\nSenator Rubio offered up one vehicle for change through the Averting the\nNational Threat of Internet Surveillance, Oppressive Censorship and Influence,\nand Algorithmic Learning by the Chinese Communist Party Act, or simply the\nANTI-SOCIAL CCP Act.^62ANTI-SOCIAL CCP Act, S. 5245, 117th Cong. (2022).\nSenator Rubio\u2019s act would change the wording of Section 1702(b) of IEEPA to\ngive the president the authority to prohibit the import of nonphysical goods.\nThis would allow the ban of intangible property like software applications,\nopening the door for the president to ban TikTok.\n\nSenator Warner\u2019s RESTRICT Act, however, has gotten the most attention and was\nonce considered the vehicle to make a ban happen. In effect, it would\nestablish a parallel review system to CFIUS in the Department of Commerce. If\nit passed, the secretary of commerce would have the authority to review\ntransactions made by specific foreign entities offering \u201cinformation and\ncommunications technologies products or services.\u201d^63RESTRICT Act, S. 686,\n118th Cong. (2023). The effect would be the elimination of the Berman\nAmendments altogether.\n\nIt remains an open question whether either one of these changes to the law\nwould be constitutional. The First Amendment still limits what Congress or the\npresident can do.\n\nOf course, the White House endorsed the RESTRICT Act because it would grant\nthe executive sweeping powers.^64Kevin Collier and Scott Wong, \u201cWhite House\nBacks Bipartisan Bill That Could Be Used to Ban TikTok,\u201d NBC, March 7, 2023,\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/restrict-act-bill-tiktok-rcna73682. But\nanalysts have pointed to the many flaws in this legislation, including the\nopaque and largely unaccountable authority the bill would provide to the\nsecretary of commerce.^65Mike Masnick, \u201cSenator Warner\u2019s RESTRICT Act Is\nDesigned to Create the Great Firewall of America,\u201d TechDirt, March 30, 2023,\nhttps://www.techdirt.com/2023/03/30/senator-warners-restrict-act-is-designed-\nto-create-the-great-firewall-of-america/; Scott Lincicome, Clark Packard,\nJennifer Huddleston, and Will Duffield, \u201c\u2018TikTok Legislation\u2019 Is a Blank Check\nfor Government Encroachment upon Americans\u2019 Wealth, Privacy, and Safety,\u201d Cato\nat Liberty (blog), April 3, 2023, https://www.cato.org/blog/tiktok-\nlegislation-blank-check-government-encroachment-upon-americans-wealth-privacy-\nsafety; Milton Mueller, \u201cThe RESTRICT Act: Reversing Globalization In ICT,\u201d\nInternet Governance Project, March 13, 2023,\nhttps://www.internetgovernance.org/2023/03/13/the-restrict-act-reversing-\nglobalization-in-ict/. The bill is so expansive, especially with its\ndefinition of \u201cinternet communications technologies,\u201d that mundane and helpful\nservices like VPNs or payment systems might be caught up in a ban. The\nreaction by civil society was swift and critical because of just how sweeping\nthe bill is.^66\u201cThe \u2018Insanely Broad\u2019 Restrict Act Could Ban Much More than\nJust TikTok,\u201d Hacker News, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35369075. It\nwould mean violators could face 20 years in prison for using a VPN to access\nTikTok.\n\nAttorneys at Dunlap Bennett & Ludwig, however, think the most direct way to\naddress the informational-materials exception in IEEPA \u201cis to give the\nPresident the power to review foreign technologies, specifically involving\ncommunications networks and social media companies that provide tangible and\nintangible technologies (from computer chips to software code) for importation\ninto the United States that have an adversarial interest against the United\nStates.\u201d^67\u201cWhy Can\u2019t They Just Ban It?\u201d Dunlap Bennett & Ludwig (blog),\nJanuary 13, 2023, https://www.dbllawyers.com/federal-government-to-ban-\ntiktok/. In other words, instead of going after Section 1702(b), a specific\npower to review social media companies and other related technologies should\nbe created as Section 1702(a)(4) of IEEPA. Much like an outright ban, as\nexplained in the previous section, this change would have to pass court muster\nand First Amendment challenge. That is currently a really big if.\n\nPolicymakers should be mindful of the collateral effects of any TikTok-ban\nbill. Broader bills like the RESTRICT Act, which could lead to TikTok\u2019s being\nbanned or otherwise limited, could catch many international small and medium-\nsized businesses in their purview either intentionally or unintentionally.\n\nThe biggest problem with RESTRICT is that it would give even more power to the\nexecutive. The responsibility of crafting and implementing policies,\nespecially those related to national security and foreign investments, already\nlargely lies with the president. By transferring more decision-making\nauthority to the executive branch, there is a potential risk of consolidating\ntoo much power in the hands of a single entity that already says little about\nhow it makes decisions. In other words, placing the authority to ban apps\nsolely in the hands of the executive branch raises concerns about\naccountability. Already the CFIUS process is opaque. By limiting Congress even\nmore, there is a risk of diminished oversight and reduced opportunities for\npublic debate.\n\n## States\u2019 Legislatures Enter the Fray\n\nWhile federal legislation has seemingly stalled, state legislatures have\nacted. This summer Montana passed SB 419, which was titled appropriately An\nAct Banning TikTok in Montana.^68Mont. S. B. 0419, (2023). This legislation,\nthe first of its kind, was explicit: \u201cTiktok may not operate within the\nterritorial jurisdiction of Montana.\u201d\n\nOn May 17, Governor Greg Gianforte signed the bill but not before trying to\nnegotiate with the legislature to change the language so it didn\u2019t\nspecifically target the app.^69Sapna Maheshwari, \u201cMontana Governor Signs Total\nBan of TikTok in the State,\u201d New York Times, May 17, 2023,\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/17/business/montana-tiktok-ban.html. At the\nend of April, Governor Gianforte sent back to the legislature what is known as\nan amendatory veto, which provides alternative draft language that the\ngovernor would sign if the legislature agreed.^70\u201cSB 419 Amendatory Veto,\u201d\nGovernor\u2019s Office Draft, April, 25, 2023,\nhttps://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23792226/sb-419-amendatory-veto.pdf. In\nan e-mail exchange between Montana attorney general Austin Knudsen, bill-\nsponsor senator Shelly Vance, and the governor\u2019s office, Knudsen wrote that\n\u201cat this point, my preference is to leave the bill as is. [Montana\u2019s\nDepartment of Justice] is prepared to defend it.\u201d^71Eric Dietrich, \u201cGianforte\nSignals He\u2019ll Sign TikTok Ban\u2014but Prefers Change First,\u201d Montana Free Press,\nApril 27, 2023, https://montanafreepress.org/2023/04/27/montana-governor-\ngianforte-pushes-back-on-tiktok-ban-bill/.\n\nAlmost immediately the bill was challenged in court by TikTok users.^72Mike\nMasnick, \u201cTikTok Users Waste No Time: Sue Montana Same Day TikTok Ban Was\nSigned,\u201d TechDirt, May 19th, 2023, https://www.techdirt.com/2023/05/19/tiktok-\nusers-waste-no-time-sue-montana-same-day-tiktok-ban-was-signed/. Much as\nexpected, the challenge called into question the constitutionality of the bill\nespecially as it relates to the First Amendment. First Amendment jurisprudence\nsets a high bar for a government restriction on a tool of expression.\n\nCourts could say that a broad TikTok ban is prior restraint and is thus\nsubject to the highest level of constitutional scrutiny\u2014strict scrutiny. Under\nthis framework the government would need to demonstrate that the ban is\nnarrowly tailored in furtherance of a \u201ccompelling government interest.\u201d^73Joel\nThayer, \u201cBanning TikTok Outright Would Be Constitutional,\u201d Federalist Society,\nFebruary 10, 2023, https://fedsoc.org/commentary/fedsoc-blog/banning-tiktok-\noutright-would-be-constitutional. Narrow tailoring means that \u201cif a less\nrestrictive alternative would serve the [g]overnment\u2019s purpose, the\nlegislature must use that alternative.\u201d^74\u201cAmdt1.7.3.1 Overview of Content-\nBased and Content-Neutral Regulation of Speech,\u201d Constitution Annotated,\nhttps://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt1-7-3-1/ALDE_00013695/. In\nother words, the government would have to bear the burden of proof that\nproposed alternatives are less effective than the challenged law.\n\nOr the courts could say that a ban is content neutral, meaning it would be\njudged under intermediate scrutiny. Regulations that either don\u2019t focus on\ncontent or only occasionally curtail speech during the regulation of conduct\nfall under this constitutional standard. Still, there are similar thresholds\nto strict scrutiny, requiring that the regulation \u201cfurthers an important or\nsubstantial governmental interest\u201d that is \u201cunrelated to the suppression of\nfree expression,\u201d and that \u201cthe incidental restriction on alleged First\nAmendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that\ninterest.\u201d Courts might also ask whether a regulation \u201cleave[s] open ample\nalternative channels for communication.\u201d^75\u201cRestricting TikTok (Part II):\nLegislative Proposals and Considerations for Congress,\u201d Congressional Research\nService, September 28, 2023,\nhttps://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/LSB/LSB10942. In a review of the\nlegality of Trump\u2019s WeChat ban, which happened around the same time as the\nTikTok ban, the court concluded the restrictions were not appropriately\ntailored and failed intermediate scrutiny. It noted that there were \u201cobvious\nalternatives to a complete ban, such as barring WeChat from government devices\n. . . or taking other steps to address data security.\u201d As it stands, courts\nmust look closely at the government\u2019s evidence to ensure \u201cthat the recited\nharms are real, not merely conjectural, and that the regulation will in fact\nalleviate these harms in a direct and material way.\u201d^76\u201cIntermediate\nScrutiny,\u201d Legal Information Institute, Cornell Law School, accessed May 26,\n2023, https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/intermediate_scrutiny. It is likely that\na similar set of criteria would be applied to a TikTok ban.\n\n## What Should Be Done and What\u2019s Likely to Have Limited Effects\n\nRightly, TikTok gets associated with Chinese intelligence interests and the\nCCP. While it is irrefutable that the Chinese government poses a significant\nthreat, policymakers should be careful in dealing with TikTok. Taking hasty\nmeasures now might lead to long-term ramifications, especially if these\nactions create the expectation that the US government can blacklist foreign\ncompanies using national security as blanket justification.\n\nThere are a lot of options on the table with TikTok, but they all must begin\nwith defining the exact harms that need to be mitigated. When considering a\nlegal action that would affect the free speech rights, economic income, and\nentertainment of up to 150 million Americans, the evidentiary support should\ncarry equal weight to the action itself.\n\nWhile evidence might be uncovered that supports the worst national security\nfears, the evidence so far does not support the strongest claims against\nTikTok. Rather, the chorus from the intelligence community is that TikTok has\nthe potential for harm. FBI director Wray and others have never made specific\nclaims. Rather, he, like others, has warned of \u201cthe possibility that the\nChinese government could use to control data collection on millions of users\nor control the recommendation algorithm, which could be used for influence\noperations.\u201d^77\u201cWhy does the United States want to ban TikTok?\u201d, Al Jazeera,\nMay 18, 2023, https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/18/why-does-the-united-\nstates-want-to-ban-tiktok.\n\nSometime between 2021 and 2022, TikTok worked to allay fears by implementing a\nnew data architecture, known as Project Texas.^78Matt Perault and Samm Sacks,\n\u201cProject Texas: The Details of TikTok\u2019s Plan to Remain Operational in the\nUnited States,\u201d Lawfare, January 26, 2023,\nhttps://www.lawfareblog.com/project-texas-details-tiktoks-plan-remain-\noperational-united-states. TikTok has spent some $1.5 billion to implement the\nplan, which now routes all US user data to Oracle\u2019s cloud infrastructure\ninstead of the data centers in Virginia and Singapore. TikTok has spent a lot\nto comply, which does suggest it is committed. On June 17, 2022, as part of\nProject Texas, TikTok completed the migration of data to Oracle servers for US\nTikTok users.^79Sofield, Satira, and Hinerfeld, \u201cTikTok and Oracle.\u201d In March\n2023, the company began deleting data held in other servers.\n\nProject Texas also brought content moderation into United States. On top of\nthis, TikTok has offered to disclose its algorithm, moderation policies, and\ndata flows to regulators and other third parties for review. All of these\nchanges are in addition to the above-noted alteration in the codebase to\nrestrict Chinese engineers.\n\nTikTok may be navigating ambiguous legal waters, but it is already subject to\nan oversight regime. Formalizing this process would be the most prudent next\nstep.\n\nCFIUS could take the lead and agree to a pared-down version of its summer 2022\nagreement. A government agency, likely the Department of Justice, would have\nthe ability to (1) examine TikTok\u2019s US facilities, records, equipment, and\nservers with minimal or no notice; (2) ensure ByteDance has put in place\nrestrictions on source code and sensitive data; and (3) order TikTok and\nByteDance to pay for and subject themselves to various audits, assessments,\nand other reports on the security of TikTok\u2019s US functions.\n\nTo ensure compliance, the deal could be probationary. If TikTok wasn\u2019t\ncompliant, CFIUS could reopen the case. Samm Sacks of Yale has been a\nproponent of this solution since \u201cTikTok could be audited by an outside party\nto verify how it manages its data, including to verify a firewall with its\nparent company in China.\u201d^80Samm Sacks, \u201cBanning TikTok Is a Terrible Idea,\u201d\nThe China Project, July 16, 2020,\nhttps://thechinaproject.com/2020/07/16/banning-tiktok-is-a-terrible-idea/. It\nwould formalize what is already occurring.\n\nThe passage of a federal privacy law has also been floated as a potential\nsolution. One of the supposed merits of this approach is that it wouldn\u2019t\nsolely target TikTok.^81James Andrew Lewis, \u201cTikTok and the First Amendment,\u201d\nCenter for Strategic and International Studies, November 14, 2022,\nhttps://www.csis.org/analysis/tiktok-and-first-amendment. Nevertheless, if the\nconcern is that the CCP or another hostile government might access user data\nor have sway in algorithmic decision-making, the bill would have to include\nlanguage that localizes user data and restricts all governments from modifying\nalgorithms. Data localization has largely been outside of the scope of current\nproposals and is not a provision in the leading bill, the American Data\nPrivacy and Protection Act.^82U.S Congress, House, American Data Privacy and\nProtection Act, HR 8152, 117th Cong., introduced in House June 21, 2022,\nhttps://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8152/text.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Chinese intelligence community can already buy US\ndata on the open market through data brokers if it wants. The Secret Service\ndoes it, bypassing the need for a warrant.^83Kate Cox, \u201cSecret Service Buys\nLocation Data That Would Otherwise Need a Warrant,\u201d Ars Technica, August 17,\n2020, https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/08/secret-service-other-\nagencies-buy-access-to-mobile-phone-location-data/. If this kind of\nexfiltration is a concern, then Congress should just ban all sales of personal\ndata to China. Two laws recently proposed would do just that. Under HR 6942,\nthe Internet Application Integrity and Disclosure Act, and HR 6969, the\nTelling Everyone the Location of Data Leaving the US (TELL) Act, companies\nwould be limited in the kind of information that they export or sell to\nChinese companies.\n\nSome have argued that divestiture is the only real path forward. But if\nstringent measures are taken to ensure that user data and the codebase are\nsecurely firewalled, they will effectively mimic divestiture. When implemented\nrobustly, these barriers ensure that data remains confined to its intended\nenvironment. In other words, protective measures offer a safeguard similar to\nthe outcomes expected from a divestiture, without the need for actual\nownership changes or structural separations.\n\nStill, ByteDance has suggested that it would be open to the divestiture of\nTikTok.^84Barinka and Carville, \u201cTikTok Considers Splitting.\u201d However, the\ncompany considers this option to be a last resort and will only go down this\nroad if the company cannot come to an agreement with CFIUS and can find a\nwilling buyer. Neither this administration or the previous one has been\nespecially open to this idea. Trump effectively nixed a deal that could have\nsolved this problem long ago. The Biden administration under the leadership of\nFederal Trade Commission chair Khan has taken a tough stance on antitrust. So\nfinding a willing buyer will be difficult.^85Maheshwari and David McCabe,\n\u201cFinding a Buyer.\u201d If the administration really wants a divestiture, it will\nneed to change its stance on antitrust.\n\nWhile there is no evidence of overt manipulation of the algorithm, a\nsophisticated Chinese influence campaign could take a more subtle\ntactic.^86Lewis, \u201cTikTok and the First Amendment.\u201d Operating under false\nnames, a Chinese-backed group could engage in coordinated disinformation\ncampaigns that TikTok just fails to police. As James Andrew Lewis explained,\n\u201cThe greatest risk comes not from what TikTok does, but from what it doesn\u2019t\ndo.\u201d^87Lewis, \u201cTikTok and the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nStill, close watchers of TikTok are skeptical of the claims of censorship in\nthe United States. Analyst Eugene Wei noted, \u201cI tend to think that problem is\noverrated because my sense is that many in China still don\u2019t understand the\nnuances of American culture, just as America doesn\u2019t understand\ntheirs.\u201d^88Wei, \u201cTikTok and the Sorting Hat.\u201d\n\nGiven the serious talk of banning TikTok, it\u2019s crucial that Congress properly\nresearch and validate the need for such a significant step. In other words,\nCongress needs to open an investigation, as it has done in the past, to\ndetermine whether there is sufficient evidence of harm to justify a remedy as\nsevere as a ban or divestment order. Earlier this year, the House of\nRepresentatives established a select committee on China to investigate the\nstrategic challenges posed by the country.^89Mychael Schnell, \u201cHouse Easily\nPasses Resolution to Create Bipartisan China Select Committee,\u201dThe Hill,\nJanuary 10, 2023, https://thehill.com/homenews/house/3807571-house-easily-\npasses-resolution-to-create-bipartisan-china-select-committee/. A look into\nTikTok has been suggested, but nothing official has been announced.\n\nHow the CCP fits into this story is still uncertain. Shu Jueting, a\nspokeswoman for the government, said that if the US decision would be based on\nTikTok\u2019s foreign ownership, rather than its products and services, it would\n\u201cseverely damage confidence of foreign investors, including those from\nChina.\u201d^90Liu Zhihua, \u201cChina Opposes US\u2019 Pressure to Sell TikTok Stakes,\u201d\nChina Daily, March 23, 2023,\nhttps://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202303/23/WS641c1de6a31057c47ebb6325.html.\n\nDaniel Russel of the Asia Society Policy Institute thinks there is more\nposturing than hard line in China\u2019s statements about TikTok. As he explained,\n\u201cThe Chinese government\u2019s public declaration that it would block the sale of\nTikTok in the US has little to do with protection of Chinese algorithms and\ntechnology and a lot to do with giving Washington a taste of its own\nmedicine.\u201d^91Evelyn Cheng, \u201cTikTok Wants to Distance Itself from China\u2014but\nBeijing Is Getting Involved,\u201d CNBC, March 24, 2023,\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/24/tiktok-wants-to-distance-from-china-but-the-\ngovernments-getting-involved.html. Continuing, he noted that \u201cBeijing, having\nheard [Commerce] Secretary Raymond\u2019s lament that banning TikTok would\ninfuriate voters under 35, is now double-daring Congress and the\nAdministration to \u2018make my day.\u2019\u201d So it remains unclear whether China would\ntry to push back against a sale.\n\nWhile those in favor of banning TikTok highlight the benefits, there are clear\ndownsides as well. For one, banning apps like WeChat and TikTok closes off\nAmerican companies from foreign markets. One recent report estimates that\nApple would suffer a 25\u201330 percent decline in global sales if these apps were\nnot available.^92Eric Slivka, \u201cKuo: Global iPhone Shipments Could Decline up\nto 30% if Apple Forced to Remove WeChat from App Store,\u201d MacRumors, August 9,\n2020, https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/10/kuo-wechat-ban-iphone-shipments/.\n\nMost importantly, banning TikTok removes the soft influence that the US market\ncould play in shaping one of the most valuable tech companies in the world. In\nfact, the company seems to be struggling to pull itself away from its Chinese\nroots. All of the small shifts to capture the large international market have\ncaused a backlash in China, where the founder is routinely called \u201ca traitor\nof China, a coward, and an American apologist.\u201d^93Liao, \u201cChinese Internet\nUsers.\u201d The move would embolden techno-nationalist voices within China to take\neven harder stances on the United States.^94Jeffrey Ding, \u201cChinAI #105: A Slow\nNews Approach to TikTok\u2019s Forced Sale,\u201d ChinAI Newsletter, August 3, 2020,\nhttps://chinai.substack.com/p/chinai-105-a-slow-news-approach-to.\n\nPolicymakers need to be clear-eyed that there\u2019s limited evidence of harm with\nTikTok. TikTok exists in a legal gray area, but it is being de facto regulated\nby the CFIUS process. Simply put, there are ways of mitigating the potential\nthreats of TikTok other than a complete ban. But first and most importantly,\nthose concerns need to be clearly laid out.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis likely won\u2019t be the last time the US needs to address an app with ties to\na foreign adversary. Indeed, there are other popular Chinese-based apps in use\nthroughout the US.^95Sara Fischer, \u201cAmericans Hooked on Chinese Apps,\u201d Axios\nMedia Trends, March 27, 2023, https://www.axios.com/2023/03/27/americans-\nhooked-on-chinese-apps. Whatever is done with TikTok will set a precedent\ndomestically and internationally for other Chinese-based apps or apps and\nplatforms that are based in other countries, whether they are foreign\nadversaries or countries with lax laws or corrupt governments. The benefits\nand risks of the Internet are that it is a borderless, international network.\n\nIn the end, we need to move away from the false dilemma of ban or no ban, and\nwork toward more nuanced and effective approaches that safeguard user privacy,\npromote healthy competition, and encourage responsible content moderation.\n\nCGO scholars and fellows frequently comment on a variety of topics for the\npopular press.
