Goswami@in/rohangoswamicnbc/@rogoswami\n\nWATCH LIVE\n\nKey Points\n\n  * Tesla will ask shareholders to reapprove CEO Elon Musk\u2019s $56 billion pay package, months after a Delaware court found it deeply flawed and voided it.\n  * The company is also seeking to reincorporate in Texas as a direct result of the court decision.\n  * Musk has publicly and bitterly decried both the decision and continued incorporation in Delaware in the aftermath of the case, but Tesla\u2019s board says it arrived at both decisions independently.\n\nIn this article\n\n  * TSLA+1.24 (+0.79%)\n\nElon Musk attends the premiere of \u2032\u2032Lola\u2032\u2032 held at the Regency Bruin Theatre\nin Los Angeles, California, U.S., February 3, 2024.\n\nAude Guerrucci | Reuters\n\nTesla said Wednesday it will ask shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk\u2019s $56\nbillion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year after\nruling that the record-setting compensation deal was \u201cdeeply flawed.\u201d\n\nTesla also said it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company\u2019s\nincorporation from Delaware to Texas. Musk had suggested the move after his\npay package was ruled illegal. The announcement Wednesday came days after\nTesla said it would cut its workforce by 10%.\n\nTesla said the court decision created a \u201cfundamental problem for the company.\u201d\n\nThe two proposals are likely to be fiercely controversial. Tesla has hired a\nproxy solicitor, Innisfree M&A, and plans to spend an undetermined amount, in\nthe millions, to help secure the votes for the two proposals, according to the\nfiling.\n\nTesla has not hired Innisfree since 2018, when it first asked shareholders to\nvote on Musk\u2019s pay package. Companies often only advertise the cost of proxy\nsolicitations when major proposals or proxy fights are expected. (Innisfree\nwas also suing Musk\u2019s Twitter over unpaid bills.)\n\nMusk\u2019s pay package was invalidated after a shareholder won a lawsuit against\nthe company earlier this year. Delaware Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen\nMcCormick found that Musk, rather than Tesla\u2019s board, controlled the company\nand that the board\u2019s compensation committee, rather than negotiating with Musk\nover the terms of the deal, \u201cworked alongside him, almost as an advisory\nbody.\u201d\n\nThe Tornetta decision, named after Tesla shareholder Richard Tornetta who\nbrought the suit, prompted Musk to say, \u201cNever incorporate your company in the\nstate of Delaware.\u201d\n\nMcCormick was also the presiding judge in the legal action compelling Musk to\nbuy Twitter, which he renamed. Tesla, in its Wednesday filing, cast doubt on\nher decision. \u201cThe Company and the Board believe that the decision in Tornetta\nignored material evidence presented at trial and that the Delaware Court made\nerrors of fact and incorrect conclusions of law,\u201d Tesla said in the proxy\nfiling.\n\nThe company also noted that \u201cdozens of institutional stockholders\u201d have told\nTesla that they disagree with the Tornetta decision.\n\nDelaware has long been a preferred home for corporations \u2014 more than 60% of\nthe Fortune 500 are incorporated there \u2014 because the state has a robust legal\nframework and court system dedicated to resolving corporate issues, like\nexecutive pay, but also broader contract negotiations.\n\n## Moving from Delaware to Texas\n\nTesla\u2019s new proposal cautions shareholders that the Delaware court found their\ninitial 2018 disclosures to be deficient, and urged them to read the full text\nof the decision.\n\nIn January, the same day the pay package was rejected, Musk asked his X\nfollowers if Tesla should re-incorporate in Texas. Months later, Tesla\u2019s board\nagreed and is now proposing the move to Texas and asking shareholders to\napprove the move.\n\nTesla connected the Delaware decision directly to their proposal, but it said\nthat both Elon Musk and his brother Kimbal Musk, who also sits on Tesla\u2019s\nboard, recused themselves from deliberations.\n\nThe company said that Tesla\u2019s \u201chome and future are in Texas\u201d and that the\nboard considered every U.S. state before narrowing it down to a head-to-head\ncomparison between Delaware and Texas, Musk\u2019s public comments notwithstanding.\n\nTesla also defends the move as commonplace, saying that 35% of S&P 500\ncompanies are not incorporated in Delaware. The company acknowledged\nDelaware\u2019s court system as world class, but said \u201cdoing new things is part of\nTesla\u2019s DNA, and how it has become one of the most valuable companies in the\nworld.\u201d\n\n\u2014 CNBC\u2019s Lora Kolodny and Dan Mangan contributed to this report.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO3:1703:17\n\nElon Musk\u2019s drug use worries leaders at Tesla and SpaceX\n\nSquawk Box\n\nThis is developing news.
