Most of them are not my own, but by people far more clever\nthan me. Here I\u2019m showcasing them and explaining the trick as I see it. While\nperhaps some of them are more \u201cuseful\u201d than others, there is a lot to learn\nfrom all of them, whether you ever use the technique directly or not.\n\nCSS-Tricks is powered by DigitalOcean.\n\n#### Keep up to date on web dev\n\nwith our hand-crafted newsletter\n\n##### DigitalOcean\n\n  * DigitalOcean\n  * DigitalOcean Community\n  * About DigitalOcean\n  * Legal\n  * Free Credit Offer\n\n##### CSS-Tricks\n\n  * Email\n  * Guest Writing\n  * Book\n  * Advertising\n\n##### Follow\n\n  * Mastodon\n  * Twitter\n  * Instagram\n  * YouTube\n  * CodePen\n  * iTunes\n  * RSS\n\nBack to Top\n\n# Search results\n\nFiltersShow filters\n\nSort by:\n\n\u2022\u2022\n\n## No results found\n\n## Filter options\n\nSearch powered by Jetpack\n\n", "frontpage": true}
