Delegates and observers at the\nIntergovernmental Negotiating Committee on Plastic Pollution called it a\nwelcome sign that talk shifted from ideas to treaty language at this fourth of\nfive scheduled meetings.\n\nMost contentious is the idea of limiting how much plastic is manufactured.\nThat remains in the text over the strong objections of plastic-producing\ncountries and companies and oil and gas exporters. Most plastic is made from\nfossil fuels and chemicals.\n\nAs the Ottawa session ended, the committee agreed to keep working on the\ntreaty before its final meeting later this year in South Korea.\n\nUnited Nations Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen and\nEnvironment and Climate Change Minister Steven Guilbeault take their seats at\na news conference, April 23, 2024 in Ottawa, Ontario. (Adrian Wyld/The\nCanadian Press via AP)\n\nThe preparations for that session will focus on how to finance the\nimplementation of the treaty, assess the chemicals of concern in plastic\nproducts and look at product design. Rwanda\u2019s representative said negotiators\nignored the elephant in the room by not addressing plastic production.\n\n\u201cIn the end, this is not just about the text, it\u2019s not just about the\nprocess,\u201d said Jyoti Mathur-Filipp, executive secretary of the committee. \u201cIt\nis quite simply about providing a better future for generations and for our\nloved ones.\u201d\n\nread more\n\nDeforestation in Indonesia spiked last year, but resources analyst sees better\noverall trend\n\nActivist who fought for legal rights for Europe\u2019s largest saltwater lagoon\nwins \u2018Green Nobel\u2019\n\nStudy says it\u2019s likely a warmer world made deadly Dubai downpours heavier\n\nStewart Harris, an industry spokesperson with the International Council of\nChemical Associations, said the members want a treaty that focuses on\nrecycling plastic and reuse, sometimes referred to as \u201ccircularity.\u201d\n\nThey don\u2019t want a cap on plastic production, and think chemicals should not be\nregulated through this agreement. Harris said the association was pleased to\nsee governments coming together and agreeing to complete additional work,\nespecially on financing and plastic product design.\n\nDozens of scientists from the Scientists\u2019 Coalition for an Effective Plastics\nTreaty came to the meeting to provide research on plastic pollution to\nnegotiators, in part, they said, to dispel misinformation.\n\n\u201cI heard yesterday that there\u2019s no data on microplastics, which is verifiably\nfalse: 21,000 publications on micro and nanoplastics have been published,\u201d\nsaid Bethanie Carney Almroth, an ecotoxicology professor at Sweden\u2019s\nUniversity of Gothenburg who co-leads the coalition. \u201cIt\u2019s like Whac-A-Mole.\u201d\n\nA sign sits amongst plastic on a public art installation outside a United\nNations conference on plastics on April 23, 2024, in Ottawa, Ontario. (Adrian\nWyld/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\nShe said scientists were being harassed and intimidated by lobbyists and she\nreported to the U.N. that a lobbyist yelled in her face at a meeting.\n\nDespite their differences, the countries represented share a common vision to\nmove forward in the treaty process, Ecuador\u2019s chief negotiator, Walter\nSchuldt, said.\n\n\u201cBecause at the end of the day, we\u2019re talking about the survival of the future\nof life, not only of human life but all sorts of life on this planet,\u201d he said\nin an interview.\n\nThe treaty talks began in Uruguay in December 2022 after Rwanda and Peru\nproposed the resolution that launched the process in March 2022. Progress was\nslow during Paris talks in May 2023 and in Nairobi in November as countries\ndebated rules for the process.\n\nWhen thousands of negotiators and observers arrived in Ottawa, Luis Vayas\nValdivieso, the committee chair from Ecuador, reminded them of their purpose\nto deliver a future free of plastic pollution. He asked them to be ambitious.\n\nThe delegates have been discussing not only the scope of the treaty, but\nchemicals of concern, problematic and avoidable plastics, product design, and\nfinancing and implementation.\n\nDelegates also streamlined the unwieldy collection of options that emerged\nfrom the last meeting.\n\nMinister of Environment and Climate Change Steven Guilbeault looks on as\nChairperson of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee Ambassador Luis\nVayas Valdivieso speaks during a news conference, April 23, 2024, in Ottawa,\nOntario. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\n\u201cWe took a major step forward after two years of lots of discussion. Now we\nhave text to negotiate,\u201d said Bj\u00f6rn Beeler, international coordinator for the\nInternational Pollutants Elimination Network. \u201cUnfortunately, much more\npolitical will is needed to address the out of control escalating plastic\nproduction.\u201d\n\nMany traveled to Ottawa from communities affected by plastic manufacturing and\npollution. Louisiana and Texas residents who live near petrochemical plants\nand refineries handed out postcards aimed at the U.S. State Department saying,\n\u201cWish you were here.\u201d\n\nThey traveled together as a group from the Break Free From Plastic movement,\nand asked negotiators to visit their states to experience the air and water\npollution firsthand.\n\n\u201cThis is still the best option we have to see change in our communities.\nThey\u2019re so captured by corporations. I can\u2019t go to the parish government,\u201d\nsaid Jo Banner, of the St. John the Baptist Parish in Louisiana. \u201cIt feels\nthis is the only chance and hope I have of helping my community repair from\nthis, to heal.\u201d\n\nMembers of an Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Caucus held a news conference Saturday to\nsay microplastics are contaminating their food supply and the pollution\nthreatens their communities and ways of life guaranteed to them in perpetuity.\nThey felt their voices weren\u2019t being heard.\n\n\u201cWe have bigger stakes. These are our ancestral lands that are being polluted\nwith plastic,\u201d Juressa Lee of New Zealand said after the event. \u201cWe\u2019re\nrightsholders, not stakeholders. We should have more space to speak and make\ndecisions than the people causing the problem.\u201d\n\nIn the Bay of Plenty, a source of seafood on New Zealand\u2019s northern coast, the\nsediment and shellfish are full of tiny plastic particles. They regard\nnature\u2019s \u201cresources\u201d as treasures, Lee added.\n\n\u201cIndigenous ways can lead the way,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing now clearly is\nnot working.\u201d\n\nVi Waghiyi traveled from Alaska to represent Arctic Indigenous peoples. She\u2019s\nreminding decision-makers that this treaty must protect people from plastic\npollution for generations to come.\n\nShe said, \u201cWe come here to be the conscience, to ensure they make the right\ndecision for all people.\u201d\n\n## ___\n\nThe Associated Press\u2019 climate and environmental coverage receives financial\nsupport from multiple private foundations.
