The Alaska Air National Guard is facing\nan overhaul of 80 of its active full-time positions that officials say will\nreduce its ability to perform rescues. Alaska National Guard photo by Dana\nRosso.\n\nSHARE\n\nEven by Alaska standards, September 12, 2023, was a big day.\n\n\u201cWe had four missions in that day in all four corners of Alaska,\u201d said Col.\nJohn Romspert, the director of staff for the Alaska Air National Guard.\n\nIn a span of 12 hours, Alaska ANG rescue teams responded to two plane crashes\non opposite sides of the state, three lost hunters on a remote river, and a\nmedical emergency in an arctic village. Crews from the 210th, 211th, and 212th\nrescue squadrons launched two HH-60 helicopters and two HC-130J tankers, each\nwith two-man pararescue teams on board. In all, close to 20 Guard aviators\nflew for almost 24 hours on the missions. Maintenance crews came in early and\nstayed late to get the aircraft off the ground.\n\nIt was the kind of rare, full-throttle rescue day that Brig. Gen. Brian Kile\nhas seen from almost every angle. In his 34-years in the Alaska ANG, he has\nserved as an enlisted loadmaster on HC-130 rescue tankers, then as a pilot of\nthe Guard\u2019s HH-60 rescue helicopters for almost 20 years before becoming the\nguard\u2019s commanding officer in early 2023.\n\nBut under a new manpower plan that will cover the state Guards in all 50\nstates and 4 territories, Kile told Task & Purpose, he fears he may be the\ncommander who has to oversee the Alaska ANG failing to live up to its\ncommitments.\n\nThough best known for its backcountry civilian rescues, the Alaska ANG\u2019s 2,400\nmembers maintain four separate 24/7 air defense missions under U.S. Northern\nCommand.\n\nAn Alaska ANG analysis reviewed by Task & Purpose projects that the reductions\n\u2014 even if replacements are found \u2014 would cause the Alaska ANG to fall short as\nmuch as 50% across four key 24/7 alert missions that Guardsman currently fill:\ntwo alerts of specially trained radar operators that scan the air and space of\nAlaska\u2019s borders for NORAD; and two flying missing \u2014 search and rescue and\nair-to-air refueling.\n\nThe hardest hit would be the Alaska ANG\u2019s KC-135 tanker fleet, Kile said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about a 40 to 45 percent reduction in our ability to fly\nmissions.\u201d For the NORAD radar monitoring missions, he said, \u201dyou look at how\nmany people it takes to go on the floor and what we can provide is about, five\ndays a week, 16 hours a day in coverage.\u201d And the rescue teams, he said, might\nonly have alert crews available during working days.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say rescue is going to fail. I can\u2019t say the NORAD mission is going\nto fail. I can say that our ability to provide forces to those missions is\ngoing to be at a loss of about this percentage,\u201d Kile said.\n\nBrig. Gen.

Photo by Senior Master Sgt. Julie Avey.\n\nThe manpower plan developed by the National Guard Bureau \u2014 dubbed Program\nElement Code Leveling, or PEC Leveling \u2014 would cut 80 full-time active\npositions from the Alaska ANG by October. The losses would include close to a\ndozen pilots, three pararescuemen, and close to 20 of the \u201cscope watchers\u201d\nthat man NORAD early warning facilities, plus maintainers who support all four\nmissions. The Alaska ANG would replace those roles with 88 \u201cDual Status\nTechnicians\u201d \u2014 a quasi-civilian position that, Kile said, is not workable to\nfill the 100+ spots on the Guard\u2019s 24/7 alert rosters.\n\nOfficials with the National Guard Bureau confirmed to Task & Purpose that the\nAlaska ANG is set to lose 80 active slots while gaining 88 Dual Status\nTechnician positions.\n\nNational Guard Bureau officials disputed that the change in manpower would\nnecessarily reduce readiness.\n\n\u201cState leadership has full authority to align/re-align its resources to meet\nassigned missions,\u201d a National Guard Bureau official told Task & Purpose in\nemail responses to questions on Alaska manning. \u201c[The Alaska ANG] gained eight\nfunded full-time resources.\u201d\n\nThere we no plans, the official, to change the mission requirements for\nAlaska.\n\n\u201cThe full-time leveling initiative does not change current Active Duty or Air\nNational Guard mission assignments,\u201d the official said. \u201cThis is a realignment\nof resource type and funding only.\u201d\n\n## Spreading jobs \u2018like peanut butter\u2019\n\nAt the heart of PEC Leveling is a plan to more evenly distribute what kind of\njobs Guardsmen hold in every state.\n\nFull time jobs in the National Guard are known as Active Guard Reserve, or\n\u201cAGR\u201d positions. The careers and daily lives of AGR guardsmen are generally\nindistinguishable from active duty military. AGR guardsmen usually work full-\ntime on a military base; train, deploy, and get promoted on the same paths as\nactive duty; and collect salaries and benefits \u2014 including healthcare,\nretirement, and education \u2014 largely identical to active duty soldiers and\nairmen, though some differences exist state to state.\n\nUnder a cap controlled by Congress, all 54 states and territories must split\nup a maximum of 25,333 AGR jobs across the country. Which states get those AGR\nspots is at the heart of PEC Leveling.\n\n\u201cFor the last three years, we\u2019ve asked Congress to raise this cap,\u201d said\nRomspert, the Alaska staff director and a former pararescueman. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t\nhappened. So they said, \u2018We\u2019re just going to peanut butter-spread resources\nacross all 54.\u2019 They didn\u2019t take into account the missions.\u201d\n\nAlaska Air National Guard pararescuemen assigned to the 212th Rescue Squadron,\nAlaska Air National Guard, conduct a freefall jump out of a of a C-17\nGlobemaster III assigned to the 144th Airlift Squadron, over the Pacific Ocean\nnear Homer, Alaska, March 3, Air Force photo by Senior Airman Emily\nFarnsworth.\n\nUnder the plan, 80 of Alaska\u2019s AGR spots will go to other states while the\nAlaska ANG gains 88 of the part-military, part-civilian Dual Status Technician\npositions.\n\nAirmen who work as technicians perform military duties, hold rank, and wear\nuniforms at work. But technicians are paid on a Government Services payscale\nand subject to unionized working rules, including limited working hours.\nTechnicians are generally not enrolled in regular military healthcare,\nretirement or education benefits.\n\n\u201cAnd, \u2018oh by the way,\u2019 it\u2019s voluntary,\u201d Kile said. \u201cSo when I ask somebody, a\ntechnician, if they are willing to fly a mission or or watch the scope, they\ncan tell me no.\u201d\n\nAccording to an Alaska ANG analysis, an AGR pilot who switches to a technician\njob would face a $75,000 annual pay cut, counting benefits. Enlisted spots in\nroles like logistics and finance would see pay cuts from $10,000 among junior\ntroops to $40,000 for senior NCOs.\n\n\u201cThese members have been clear they will seperate/seek other employment as\nearly as April,\u201d an Alaska ANG memo said.\n\n## Four NORAD Missions\n\n\u201cThe Air National Guard has always been considered a strategic reserve,\nright?,\u201d Kile told Task & Purpose. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been looked at as this \u2018break\nglass in case of emergency\u2019 force. Over the 20 years or so, we have actually\nbecome less of a strategic reserve and more of an operational force,\nspecifically in Alaska.\u201d\n\nThe Guard has two wings, the 168th at Eielson Air Force Base near Fairbanks\nand the 176th at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson near Anchorage. The wings\nstaff four distinct missions assigned by US Northern Command, all of which are\nmajor lynchpins in the Pentagon\u2019s defense of U.S. soil on the Pacific rim.\n\nCrews and airmen with the Alaska ANG hold four 24/7 alerts across the state:\n\nAlaska NORAD.\n\n  * Space Early Warning: Clear Space Force Station, located halfway between Anchorage and Fairbanks, is a nerve center for a network of powerful long-range radars that monitor much of eastern Russia and North Korea as part of the Pentagon\u2019s Ballistic Missile Early Warning System. The 168th Wing\u2019s 213th Space Warning Squadron mans a 24-hour, 12-man alert of \u201cscope watchers\u201d at the station, with crews living at Clear for four days during an alert cycle. About 41 Guard personnel cover the shifts, plus 60 security forces personnel. The extended hours, remote location, and high priority of the mission, Kile said, makes the job wholly unsuitable for technicians. The PEC Leveling plan would convert 4 of the 13 AGR officers that man the station to technicians.\n  * Region Air Operations Center: Analysts with the Guard\u2019s 176th Air Defense Squadron man a radar hub just outside Anchorage. While Clear watches space, the RAOC watches airspace. The 24/7 center dispatches fighter jets to intercept unknown aircraft across the northern Pacific. Under PEC Leveling, the 176th would lose 11 AGR slots for 10 technicians, who would face the same hurdles to holding alert as the space watchers at Clear.\n\nA member of the Alaska ANG\u2019s 176th Air Defense Squadron on duty at the Region\nAir Operations Center in Anchorage. Video capture by Airman 1st Class Julia\nLebens\n\nAir Sovereignty\n\nWhen the RAOC crews spot an unknown plane \u2014 often a Russian bomber on a\nreconnaissance mission, probing for a U.S. response \u2014 they launch fighter jets\nwhich sit on a 24/7 alert known as the Airspace Control Alert flown by active\nduty pilots. To support them, Alaska ANG crews hold two alerts:\n\n  * Refueling: The Guard\u2019s 168th Operations Group maintains a 24/7 alert with KC-135 tankers at Eielson. On seven-day rotations, three crews \u2014 two pilots and a boom operator in each \u2014 live in alert facilities for quick launches. In winter months, maintenance crews are larger than normal due to the cold, Kile said. \u201cIf crews don\u2019t preheat the tanker and a pilot steps on the ladder to climb up, it\u2019ll crack the co-pilot window. So the maintenance footprint is probably three times what it is at, say, Kansas,\u201d Kile said. \u201cThere\u2019s not another unit that can come up and operate in minus-40.\u201d\n  * Rescue: Should the Air Sovereignty fighters, Eielson\u2019s tankers or even an intruder end up crashing, the 176th Wing\u2019s rescue squadrons would respond. The 176th keeps an HC-130J, an HH-60 helicopter and two pararescue teams on 24/7 alert. Though the 176th\u2019s search and rescue units responded 159 times in 2023 to civilians lost or hurt in the Alaskan backcountry, those rescues are, on paper, a side-benefit to the unit\u2019s core NORAD alert mission. PEC leveling would convert three PJs and a handful of aircrew to technicians. With the reduced manning in aircrews, Alaska ANG officials estimate the rescue alert might drop to workdays-only, at 18 days per month, 9 hours per day.\n\nAccording to Kile, technician positions are well suited for many jobs across\nthe Guard, from admin spots to many technical roles like maintenance and life\nsupport, medical techs or parachute riggers. But to cover any of the Guard\u2019s\nfour 24-hour alert missions as a pilot, aircrew, pararescuemen or NORAD \u201cscope\nwatcher,\u201d Kile says an airman needs to either be an AGR, or on special one-off\nactivation orders \u2014 a paperwork nightmare that changes how airmen are paid,\nhow they accrue retirement and their healthcare.\n\n\u201cThe value AGRs give us to function in these mission sets, all four of them,\nits agile, and it\u2019s responsive to the needs of the mission. They don\u2019t change\nstatus, they don\u2019t change benefits, and it is quick and responsive,\u201d Kile\nsaid. \u201cMoving a technician to active status is cumbersome.\u201d\n\nTechnicians, Kile noted, are not the same as a part-time, or \u201ctraditional,\u201d\nGuardsman, who hold civilian jobs and report for monthly \u201cdrill\u201d duty and\nannual training. Alaskan alert units have been able to activate traditional\nguard members for alert duty for decades, Kile said, because their pay and\nbenefits follow the AGR system. Technicians, however, must be moved in and out\nof civilian pay status, with different, often incompatible rules. PEC Leveling\nis not anticipated to impact Alaska\u2019s Traditional positions.\n\n\u201cI think some of this is coming from Air National Guard leadership,\u201d Kile\nsaid. \u201cThey\u2019re not interested in us doing [active alert] Title 10 missions\nanymore and would like to see us back to more of a strategic reserve and less\nof an operational force.\u201d\n\n## Four missions to four corners\n\nThe four missions on September 12 were each typical for Alaska: three stranded\nhunters stuck on a cold, remote river; a critically ill patient in need of a\nmedivac from a village so far above the Arctic Circle that polar bears\noccasionally wander the town; and two small planes that crashed 500 miles\napart.\n\nAcross all four missions, the Guard arrived too late to save just one man.\nEugene Peltola Jr, the husband of Alaska congresswoman Mary Peltola, passed\naway at the site of a plane crash near St. Mary\u2019s, 400 miles from Anchorage,\nbefore rescuers arrived.\n\nDays like September 12 come along at least once a year for the Alaska ANG.\nThere might be multiple missions in day, or a huge all-hands rescue like the\n2006 Cougar Ace in which the Alaska ANG and Coast Guard sent five aircraft and\nover a dozen PJs to a massive cargo ship that rolled over at sea.\n\nThe next time one hits, Kile said, he has faith the Alaska ANG crews will\nstill respond.\n\n\u201cIf I make a call to the, to the 212th, to the 211th, the 210th, people don\u2019t\ncare what status they\u2019re in, they don\u2019t care what\u2019s going on. Someone\u2019s life\nis in danger, they\u2019re gonna do everything they can to launch,\u201d Kil said. \u201cSo\nits hard to give you a number [of readiness loss] because of the\nprofessionalism of our rescue force. But there\u2019s going to be a degradation\nbecause there has to be.\u201d\n\n## The latest on Task & Purpose\n\n  * Air Force special operators must take class before getting shaving waivers\n  * Camp Pendleton Marines encouraged to fix their own barracks rooms\n  * 101st Airborne soldiers are first to receive new Next Gen Squad Weapon\n  * Air Force fires commander of Holloman maintenance group\n  * Army investigating Nazi imagery on Special Forces patch posted online\n\nMatt White\n\nMatt White is a senior editor at Task & Purpose.
