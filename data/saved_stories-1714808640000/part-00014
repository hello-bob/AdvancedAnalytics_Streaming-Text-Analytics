Symmetry, balance, contrast, and space\nmust be reflected in the built environment. Clean lines merge with light to\nprovoke some reaction in the viewer, something visceral should be felt when\nlooking at a building. Modern architecture does not provoke and so the builder\ndoes not inspired by them. As I write, all I would like to build is probably\nillegal: imposing buildings that make liberal use of stonework and sculpture\nconstructed with an emphasis on symmetry. Having spent time trying to reform\nplanning laws, I co-founded a housing policy think tank in Ireland. I am now\nconvinced legislative change is only part of the answer if architecture\u2019s\nplace in the engine of progress is to be regained. Part of this involves\ncapturing the spirit of numerous neoclassical architects, chief among these is\nEtienne-Louis Boull\u00e9e (1728 \u2013 1799). His visions were so fantastic, few were\nbuilt and though Boull\u00e9ehas been largely forgotten, now is the time to\nrehabilitate him.\n\nWorking amidst the dying light of the Ancien R\u00e9gime, Boull\u00e9e was heavily\ninfluenced by advances in science, geometry and art that offered the\npossibility of successfully channelling the spirit of the cenotaphs and\ntemples of Ancient Rome and Classical Greece, societies that were so defined\nby their public works. By taking the torch from Boull\u00e9e and embracing his\nphilosophy, to inspire man at a time in which great leaps in science and\ntechnology make abundance possible, this can be achieved, modern civilisation\ncan build more. Civilisation needs more Boull\u00e9es.\n\nA key aspect of Boull\u00e9e\u2019s work is the idea of architecture parlante or\nspeaking architecture, buildings must explain their own function; one way of\nachieving this is putting allegorical sculptures and designs at their core.\nStretching architecture to its limits has a purpose beyond the visual, it\ngives a glimpse of the technologically possible. Newton\u2019s Cenotaph,\nreminiscent of the Vegas Sphere, was pitched as a burial chamber for the\nphysicist with the tomb to lie empty as a metaphor for the chasm left by\nNewton\u2019s death. Indeed, the fact that the cenotaph is sacred and the sphere\nprofane speaks to how some aspects of society have devolved.\n\nNewton\u2019s Cenotaph - elevation\n\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\n\nIn the same way as Boull\u00e9e\u2019s Newton\u2019s Cenotaph was deemed too ambitious, too\nunwieldy and too flamboyant by his peers, my visions of monuments to progress\nwould violate some aspect of Ireland\u2019s Planning and Development Act (2000) or\nsome aspect of New York City\u2019s Building Code (1968) \u2013 legislation I have\nrecently familiarised myself with. At 500 feet in diameter and taller than the\nPyramids of Giza, Newton\u2019s Cenotaph would violate Ireland\u2019s restrictions on\nbuilding height, normally no more than eight storeys for commercial use or\nthree storeys for residential use with few apartment blocks exceeding five\nstoreys. New York City\u2019s Planning Commission would not tolerate the prospect\nof such a globe being built with many prominent architects including Le\nCorbusier decrying the city for this reason. Building is both art and science:\nthe tension between the subjective and the objective creates the tension\nrequired for creativity.\n\nThe Cenotaph\u2019s three-tiered cylindrical base creates the illusion of a buried\nvolume made more convincing by the tiered ramps that ensconce the building.\nSuch ramps are illegal in New York City: stairs must not be greater than 75\nfeet in height. The rows of cypress trees, symbols of endurance and mourning,\nwould draw the ire of some Irish residents\u2019 association, fearful of minute\nchanges to the skyline and the perceived risk of declines in the value of\ntheir homes or that more strangers would set foot in \u2018their\u2019 area. Only\nrecently have such groups been banned from taking cases against planning\nproposals directly to Ireland\u2019s High Court though the tyranny of the vocal\nminority lives on in many aspects of Ireland\u2019s planning process. The interior\nof the Cenotaph contains a long, low corridor, likely too low for Ireland\u2019s\ncurrent planning regime, that would guide people to the sphere's base.\nSymmetry is maintained by the building\u2019s set piece, a square platform\nsupporting an empty tomb for Newton, like the trees, the empty tomb embodies\nthe vastness of the science Newton discovered.\n\nThe little light in the Cenotaph would be enhanced by an astrolabe at night,\nreminiscent of the roof box at Newgrange, a neolithic Irish tomb. Boull\u00e9e\u2019s\nastrolabe would imitate the sun and remind one of all that is possible, the\njuxtaposition between light or knowing and the mystery of the dark would imbue\nthe onlooker with a greater appreciation for all that knowledge offers.\nNewgrange operates similarly during the summer and winter solstices. In the\nsame way bursts of inspiration spark innovation in the hard sciences, for\nexample, these structures become something more through their use of light.\nToo often, modern architecture\u2019s application of light relies on creating\nexotic shapes that do not create a sense of awe, for which Bjarke Ingles\u2019 all-\nglass Mus\u00e9e Atelier Audemars Piguet is an example.\n\nNewton\u2019s Cenotaph - dome at night\n\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\n\nNewgrange\n\nSource: Wikipedia Commons\n\nNewgrange\u2019s Roof Box\n\nSource: Shadows and Stone\n\nMus\u00e9e Atelier Audemars Piguet - exterior\n\nSource: Archdaily\n\nMus\u00e9e Atelier Audemars Piguet - interior\n\nSource: Audemars Piguet\n\nModern architecture is dead with its unwillingness to challenge people\u2019s\nemotions, there is a sameness in today\u2019s monuments with their aversion to\nscale, today\u2019s skyscrapers are indistinguishable, a fate aided by stale\nplanning regulations that leave no room for the hope offered by the possible.\nBoull\u00e9e\u2019s Egyptian pyramid, lies uncapped, emphasising that death is not the\nend, uses its sheer scale as a public monument. The semi-circular entrance\nwith its gently sloping stairs suggests that something is hidden, some\nmystery, a sense that modern architecture refrains from embracing. The\nsymmetry of the pyramid lies in stark contrast to the modern buildings that\nhave scarred so many streets. Irish planning regulations do not refer to the\naesthetic aspects of architecture besides implementing guidelines that\nrestrict creativity. Some regarding safety are critical, others decreeing\nheight limits have surely contributed to the bungalow blight that stands as an\naffront to Ireland\u2019s colourful history of ambitious building or the meekness\nwith which public buildings have been built. Boull\u00e9e\u2019s pyramid is big, though\nnot uncouth, unlike many of New York\u2019s skyscrapers. Its use of stone gives it\na gracefulness not evident in the panes of glass that sparkle in New York\u2019s\nskyline.\n\nEgyptian Pyramid - elevation\n\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\n\nEgyptian Pyramid \u2013 Interior\n\nSource: BLDG Blog\n\nThe ultimate monument to man is the public library. Boull\u00e9e\u2019s 1785 proposal\nfor the French National Library, the Bibliotheque du Roi, proposes a space\nwhose inherent purpose is to challenge. The set piece, a vaulted reading room\nadorned with statues of gods, consists of an open vaulted space with four\ntiers of bookshelves. Active discussion is encouraged through the central\nspace designed for the intense discussion of knowledge. I am aware of no\nlibraries today that allow for such unstructured conversation amongst books.\nThe contrast between light and dark, the chiaroscuro, of Boull\u00e9e\u2019s planned\nlibrary emphasises the completeness offered by the pursuit of knowledge.\n\nHaving originally dreamt of becoming a painter, Boull\u00e9e\u2019s vision has the\nessence of Raphael\u2019s The School of Athens, where the library\u2019s size,\nperspective and openness are critical to its identity and thus to the\nAristotle and Plato of the painting. Buildings bind the tapestry of history,\ncombining the rich architectural tastes of Ancient Greece with the nervous\nhope of pre-revolutionary France. In New York City, the Schwarzman Library has\nbeen open to the public for just over a century. Its high ceilings, Vermont\nmarble and wood panels represent the pinnacle of the Beaux Arts style popular\nat the turn of the 20th century, uncoincidentally at the height of American\ndynamism,.\n\nAny society\u2019s approach to building sums up the whole: its purpose, sense of\nits own place in history, what the future could be and . Buildings are\nmonuments to the future and even to our future selves, why not transform a\nskyline now to inspire yourself to strive for greatness a decade from now?\nToday\u2019s planning regulations are a microcosm of the obstacles that stymie\nprogress, perhaps if the financial burden of applications, appeals and time\ndelays caused by objections was reduced, or even removed, public buildings\ncould challenge all that is physically possible in the way Boull\u00e9e imagined.\n\nBiblioth\u00e8que du Roi - interior\n\nSource: The Morgan Library\n\nSchwarzman Library Reading Room\n\nSource: Marymount Manhattan\n\n##\n\nHope\n\n\u2018It is to you who cultivate the arts that I dedicate the fruits of my long\nvigils; to you who, with all your learning, are persuaded \u2013 and doubtless\nrightly so \u2013 that we must not presume that all we have left is to imitate the\nancients!\u2019 \u2013 Etienne-Louis Boull\u00e9e, Essai sur l'Art (1796)\n\nLittle of Boull\u00e9e\u2019s work stands except for the H\u00f4tel Alexandre and the chapel\nat \u00c9glise Saint Roche. Though their sizes pale in comparison to his grandest\nvisions, both demonstrate the power of combining scale, detail and material in\na way that achieves more than many modern buildings. Unconstrained by planning\nproposals or endless bureaucracy, the H\u00f4tel Alexandre\u2019s draft drawings were\nfully realised and the building stands in its original form save for the\nmansard roof added later, a feature of neoclassical technique that would\nelevate the richness of almost all residential streets as demonstrated by a\nreport by Samuel Hughes. As Boull\u00e9e\u2019s constructs faded away in revolutionary\nFrance, he was largely forgotten though his influence, particularly with\nregards to incorporating the neoclassical style, lived on through Jean\nChalgrin and Jean-Nicolas-Louis Durand among others, until his name reappeared\nin the public\u2019s eye through Greenaway\u2019s \u2018The Belly of an Architect\u2019, a\nrambling film that depicts an American architect\u2019s journey to Italy to stage\nan exhibition in honour of Boull\u00e9e which gets derailed by his wife\u2019s affair\nand then his eventual suicide.\n\nNonetheless, the film\u2019s moderate success upon release ensured that Boull\u00e9e\u2019s\nidentity started to redevelop its fullness which has maintained itself four\ndecades later thanks to the Internet with communities like Vienna Canvas\nproviding space for Boull\u00e9e to speak for himself.. Immortalised through his\ndrawings and what still stands of his work, his philosophy must be used as a\nfoundation upon which society can achieve its architectural potential, every\ncivilisation\u2019s high point is marked by what it builds, and out of this\nbuilding flows its ideas. Achieving progress is only attainable through\npushing architecture to its limits in ways that respect scale, nature and\nmaterial that creates substantive works that through their beauty inspire the\npublic.\n\nH\u00f4tel Alexandre Facade\n\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\n\n\u00c9glise Saint Roche Chapel\n\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\n\nNo pursuit epitomises Boull\u00e9e\u2019s ideals more than More Monuments, established\nto build statues as a homage to builders, and to idealise progress, Mo\nMahmood\u2019s vision of structures that will \u2018mesmerise generations to come\u2019\nencapsulates all that must become part of modern architecture again.Hope lies\nin finding and encouraging those willing to take the torch from Boull\u00e9e and to\ninstil all that is beautiful about nature at the centre of architecture again.\nEconomic reasons precluded Boull\u00e9e from achieving many of his visions,\nMonumental Labs founded by Micah Springut uses AI-enabled Computer Aided\nManufacturing to drastically reduce the cost of building sculptures and\nmonuments, at no point in human history have grand designs been more\neconomically accessible. For this reason, capturing the essence of Boull\u00e9e\u2019s\nwork is possible and is indeed of civilisational importance to enable modern\narchitecture to fuel progress. Architecture has a purpose beyond the\nfunctional, architecture epitomises the culture of the time with what we build\nepitomising society\u2019s ambition and inspiring its builders.\n\nSources\n\nEssai sur l'Art (written 1796, published 1974) - Etienne-Louis Boull\u00e9e\n\nIreland\u2019s Planning and Development Act (2000)\n\nNew York City Building Codes\n\n###\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThanks to Andrew Rose for initially suggesting that I reflect on my thoughts\non building and write about them.
