An\nindustry can't spend 1,700% more on Nvidia chips than it earns indefinitely \u2013\nnot even with Nvidia being a principle investor in its largest customers:\n\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39883571\n\nA company that pays 0.36-1 cent/query for electricity and (scarce, fresh)\nwater can't indefinitely give those queries away by the millions to people who\nare expected to revise those queries dozens of times before eliciting the\nperfect botshit rendition of \"instructions for removing a grilled cheese\nsandwich from a VCR in the style of the King James Bible\":\n\nhttps://www.semianalysis.com/p/the-inference-cost-of-search-disruption\n\nEventually, the industry will have to uncover some mix of applications that\nwill cover its operating costs, if only to keep the lights on in the face of\ninvestor disillusionment (this isn't optional \u2013 investor disillusionment is an\ninevitable part of every bubble).\n\nNow, there are lots of low-stakes applications for AI that can run just fine\non the current AI technology, despite its many \u2013 and seemingly inescapable \u2013\nerrors (\"hallucinations\"). People who use AI to generate illustrations of\ntheir D&D characters engaged in epic adventures from their previous gaming\nsession don't care about the odd extra finger. If the chatbot powering a\ntourist's automatic text-to-translation-to-speech phone tool gets a few words\nwrong, it's still much better than the alternative of speaking slowly and\nloudly in your own language while making emphatic hand-gestures.\n\nThere are lots of these applications, and many of the people who benefit from\nthem would doubtless pay something for them. The problem \u2013 from an AI\ncompany's perspective \u2013 is that these aren't just low-stakes, they're also\nlow-value. Their users would pay something for them, but not very much.\n\nFor AI to keep its servers on through the coming trough of disillusionment, it\nwill have to locate high-value applications, too. Economically speaking, the\nfunction of low-value applications is to soak up excess capacity and produce\nvalue at the margins after the high-value applications pay the bills. Low-\nvalue applications are a side-dish, like the coach seats on an airplane whose\ntotal operating expenses are paid by the business class passengers up front.\nWithout the principle income from high-value applications, the servers shut\ndown, and the low-value applications disappear:\n\nhttps://locusmag.com/2023/12/commentary-cory-doctorow-what-kind-of-bubble-is-\nai/\n\nNow, there are lots of high-value applications the AI industry has identified\nfor its products. Broadly speaking, these high-value applications share the\nsame problem: they are all high-stakes, which means they are very sensitive to\nerrors. Mistakes made by apps that produce code, drive cars, or identify\ncancerous masses on chest X-rays are extremely consequential.\n\nSome businesses may be insensitive to those consequences. Air Canada replaced\nits human customer service staff with chatbots that just lied to passengers,\nstealing hundreds of dollars from them in the process. But the process for\ngetting your money back after you are defrauded by Air Canada's chatbot is so\nonerous that only one passenger has bothered to go through it, spending ten\nweeks exhausting all of Air Canada's internal review mechanisms before\nfighting his case for weeks more at the regulator:\n\nhttps://bc.ctvnews.ca/air-canada-s-chatbot-gave-a-b-c-man-the-wrong-\ninformation-now-the-airline-has-to-pay-for-the-mistake-1.6769454\n\nThere's never just one ant. If this guy was defrauded by an AC chatbot, so\nwere hundreds or thousands of other fliers. Air Canada doesn't have to pay\nthem back. Air Canada is tacitly asserting that, as the country's flagship\ncarrier and near-monopolist, it is too big to fail and too big to jail, which\nmeans it's too big to care.\n\nAir Canada shows that for some business customers, AI doesn't need to be able\nto do a worker's job in order to be a smart purchase: a chatbot can replace a\nworker, fail to their worker's job, and still save the company money on\nbalance.\n\nI can't predict whether the world's sociopathic monopolists are numerous and\npowerful enough to keep the lights on for AI companies through leases for\nautomation systems that let them commit consequence-free free fraud by\nreplacing workers with chatbots that serve as moral crumple-zones for furious\ncustomers:\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563219304029\n\nBut even stipulating that this is sufficient, it's intrinsically unstable.\nAnything that can't go on forever eventually stops, and the mass replacement\nof humans with high-speed fraud software seems likely to stoke the already\nblazing furnace of modern antitrust:\n\nhttps://www.eff.org/de/deeplinks/2021/08/party-its-1979-og-antitrust-back-baby\n\nOf course, the AI companies have their own answer to this conundrum. A high-\nstakes/high-value customer can still fire workers and replace them with AI \u2013\nthey just need to hire fewer, cheaper workers to supervise the AI and monitor\nit for \"hallucinations.\" This is called the \"human in the loop\" solution.\n\nThe human in the loop story has some glaring holes. From a worker's\nperspective, serving as the human in the loop in a scheme that cuts wage bills\nthrough AI is a nightmare \u2013 the worst possible kind of automation.\n\nLet's pause for a little detour through automation theory here. Automation can\naugment a worker. We can call this a \"centaur\" \u2013 the worker offloads a\nrepetitive task, or one that requires a high degree of vigilance, or (worst of\nall) both. They're a human head on a robot body (hence \"centaur\"). Think of\nthe sensor/vision system in your car that beeps if you activate your turn-\nsignal while a car is in your blind spot. You're in charge, but you're getting\na second opinion from the robot.\n\nLikewise, consider an AI tool that double-checks a radiologist's diagnosis of\nyour chest X-ray and suggests a second look when its assessment doesn't match\nthe radiologist's. Again, the human is in charge, but the robot is serving as\na backstop and helpmeet, using its inexhaustible robotic vigilance to augment\nhuman skill.\n\nThat's centaurs. They're the good automation. Then there's the bad automation:\nthe reverse-centaur, when the human is used to augment the robot.\n\nAmazon warehouse pickers stand in one place while robotic shelving units\ntrundle up to them at speed; then, the haptic bracelets shackled around their\nwrists buzz at them, directing them pick up specific items and move them to a\nbasket, while a third automation system penalizes them for taking toilet\nbreaks or even just walking around and shaking out their limbs to avoid a\nrepetitive strain injury. This is a robotic head using a human body \u2013 and\ndestroying it in the process.\n\nAn AI-assisted radiologist processes fewer chest X-rays every day, costing\ntheir employer more, on top of the cost of the AI. That's not what AI\ncompanies are selling. They're offering hospitals the power to create reverse\ncentaurs: radiologist-assisted AIs. That's what \"human in the loop\" means.\n\nThis is a problem for workers, but it's also a problem for their bosses\n(assuming those bosses actually care about correcting AI hallucinations,\nrather than providing a figleaf that lets them commit fraud or kill people and\nshift the blame to an unpunishable AI).\n\nHumans are good at a lot of things, but they're not good at eternal, perfect\nvigilance. Writing code is hard, but performing code-review (where you check\nsomeone else's code for errors) is much harder \u2013 and it gets even harder if\nthe code you're reviewing is usually fine, because this requires that you\nmaintain your vigilance for something that only occurs at rare and\nunpredictable intervals:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/qntm/status/1773779967521780169\n\nBut for a coding shop to make the cost of an AI pencil out, the human in the\nloop needs to be able to process a lot of AI-generated code. Replacing a human\nwith an AI doesn't produce any savings if you need to hire two more humans to\ntake turns doing close reads of the AI's code.\n\nThis is the fatal flaw in robo-taxi schemes. The \"human in the loop\" who is\nsupposed to keep the murderbot from smashing into other cars, steering into\noncoming traffic, or running down pedestrians isn't a driver, they're a\ndriving instructor. This is a much harder job than being a driver, even when\nthe student driver you're monitoring is a human, making human mistakes at\nhuman speed. It's even harder when the student driver is a robot, making\nerrors at computer speed:\n\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2024/04/01/human-in-the-loop/#monkey-in-the-middle\n\nThis is why the doomed robo-taxi company Cruise had to deploy 1.5 skilled,\nhigh-paid human monitors to oversee each of its murderbots, while traditional\ntaxis operate at a fraction of the cost with a single, precaratized, low-paid\nhuman driver:\n\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2024/01/11/robots-stole-my-jerb/#computer-says-no\n\nThe vigilance problem is pretty fatal for the human-in-the-loop gambit, but\nthere's another problem that is, if anything, even more fatal: the kinds of\nerrors that AIs make.\n\nFoundationally, AI is applied statistics. An AI company trains its AI by\nfeeding it a lot of data about the real world. The program processes this\ndata, looking for statistical correlations in that data, and makes a model of\nthe world based on those correlations. A chatbot is a next-word-guessing\nprogram, and an AI \"art\" generator is a next-pixel-guessing program. They're\ndrawing on billions of documents to find the most statistically likely way of\nfinishing a sentence or a line of pixels in a bitmap:\n\nhttps://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922\n\nThis means that AI doesn't just make errors \u2013 it makes subtle errors, the\nkinds of errors that are the hardest for a human in the loop to spot, because\nthey are the most statistically probable ways of being wrong. Sure, we notice\nthe gross errors in AI output, like confidently claiming that a living human\nis dead:\n\nhttps://www.tomsguide.com/opinion/according-to-chatgpt-im-dead\n\nBut the most common errors that AIs make are the ones we don't notice, because\nthey're perfectly camouflaged as the truth. Think of the recurring AI\nprogramming error that inserts a call to a nonexistent library called\n\"huggingface-cli,\" which is what the library would be called if developers\nreliably followed naming conventions. But due to a human inconsistency, the\nreal library has a slightly different name. The fact that AIs repeatedly\ninserted references to the nonexistent library opened up a vulnerability \u2013 a\nsecurity researcher created a (inert) malicious library with that name and\ntricked numerous companies into compiling it into their code because their\nhuman reviewers missed the chatbot's (statistically indistinguishable from the\nthe truth) lie:\n\nhttps://www.theregister.com/2024/03/28/ai_bots_hallucinate_software_packages/\n\nFor a driving instructor or a code reviewer overseeing a human subject, the\nmajority of errors are comparatively easy to spot, because they're the kinds\nof errors that lead to inconsistent library naming \u2013 places where a human\nbehaved erratically or irregularly. But when reality is irregular or erratic,\nthe AI will make errors by presuming that things are statistically normal.\n\nThese are the hardest kinds of errors to spot. They couldn't be harder for a\nhuman to detect if they were specifically designed to go undetected. The human\nin the loop isn't just being asked to spot mistakes \u2013 they're being actively\ndeceived. The AI isn't merely wrong, it's constructing a subtle \"what's wrong\nwith this picture\"-style puzzle. Not just one such puzzle, either: millions of\nthem, at speed, which must be solved by the human in the loop, who must remain\nperfectly vigilant for things that are, by definition, almost totally\nunnoticeable.\n\nThis is a special new torment for reverse centaurs \u2013 and a significant problem\nfor AI companies hoping to accumulate and keep enough high-value, high-stakes\ncustomers on their books to weather the coming trough of disillusionment.\n\nThis is pretty grim, but it gets grimmer. AI companies have argued that they\nhave a third line of business, a way to make money for their customers beyond\nautomation's gifts to their payrolls: they claim that they can perform\ndifficult scientific tasks at superhuman speed, producing billion-dollar\ninsights (new materials, new drugs, new proteins) at unimaginable speed.\n\nHowever, these claims \u2013 credulously amplified by the non-technical press \u2013\nkeep on shattering when they are tested by experts who understand the esoteric\ndomains in which AI is said to have an unbeatable advantage. For example,\nGoogle claimed that its Deepmind AI had discovered \"millions of new\nmaterials,\" \"equivalent to nearly 800 years\u2019 worth of knowledge,\" constituting\n\"an order-of-magnitude expansion in stable materials known to humanity\":\n\nhttps://deepmind.google/discover/blog/millions-of-new-materials-discovered-\nwith-deep-learning/\n\nIt was a hoax. When independent material scientists reviewed representative\nsamples of these \"new materials,\" they concluded that \"no new materials have\nbeen discovered\" and that not one of these materials was \"credible, useful and\nnovel\":\n\nhttps://www.404media.co/google-says-it-discovered-millions-of-new-materials-\nwith-ai-human-researchers/\n\nAs Brian Merchant writes, AI claims are eerily similar to \"smoke and mirrors\"\n\u2013 the dazzling reality-distortion field thrown up by 17th century magic\nlantern technology, which millions of people ascribed wild capabilities to,\nthanks to the outlandish claims of the technology's promoters:\n\nhttps://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/ai-really-is-smoke-and-mirrors\n\nThe fact that we have a four-hundred-year-old name for this phenomenon, and\nyet we're still falling prey to it is frankly a little depressing. And,\nunlucky for us, it turns out that AI therapybots can't help us with this \u2013\nrather, they're apt to literally convince us to kill ourselves:\n\nhttps://www.vice.com/en/article/pkadgm/man-dies-by-suicide-after-talking-with-\nai-chatbot-widow-says\n\n# Hey look at this (permalink)\n\n  * Tokyo flood tunnels https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/1ca336g/tokyo_flood_tunnels/\n\n  * Ghost is federating over ActivityPub https://activitypub.ghost.org (h/t Waxy)\n\n  * The Coddling of the American Parent https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-coddling-of-the-american-parent\n\n# This day in history (permalink)\n\n#15yrsago EU Parliament passes copyright term extension, rejects proposal to\ngive the addition funds to artists\nhttps://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/parliament-buckles-copyright-extension-\ngoes-through-to-council-of-ministers/\n\n#10yrsago How science fiction influences thinking about the future\nhttps://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/how-americas-leading-science-\nfiction-authors-are-shaping-your-future-180951169/?no-ist\n\n#10yrsago Obama official responsible for copyright chapters of TPP & ACTA gets\na job at MPAA; his replacement is another copyright lobbyist\nhttps://www.vox.com/2014/4/22/5636466/hollywood-just-hired-another-white-\nhouse-trade-official\n\n#10yrsago Having leisure time is now a marker for poverty, not riches\nhttps://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2014/04/22/nice-work-if-you-\ncan-get-out\n\n#10yrsago Eternal vigilance app for social networks: treating privacy\nvulnerabilities like other security risks https://freedom-to-\ntinker.com/2014/04/21/eternal-vigilance-is-a-solvable-technology-problem-a-\nproposal-for-streamlined-privacy-alerts/\n\n#10yrsago How the Russian surveillance state works\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20140206154124/http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/fall2013/Russia-\nsurveillance\n\n#5yrsago Political candidate\u2019s kids use his election flyers to fool his\nlaptop\u2019s facial recognition lock\nhttps://twitter.com/mattcarthy/status/1120641557886058496\n\n#5yrsago Fool me twice: New York State commutes Charter\u2019s death sentence after\nCharter promises to stop breaking its promises https://arstechnica.com/tech-\npolicy/2019/04/charter-avoids-getting-kicked-out-of-new-york-agrees-to-new-\nmerger-conditions/\n\n#5yrsago Greta Thunberg attributes her ability to focus on climate change to\nher Asperger\u2019s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKMX8WRw3fc\n\n#5yrsago A Sanders candidacy would make 2020 a referendum on the future, not a\nreferendum on Trump https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/22/bernie-\nsanders-democrats-trump-2020\n\n#5yrsago EU to create 350m person biometric database for borders, migration\nand law enforcement https://www.zdnet.com/article/eu-votes-to-create-gigantic-\nbiometrics-database/\n\n#1yrsago A Collective Bargain https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/23/a-collective-\nbargain/\n\n# Upcoming appearances (permalink)\n\n  * The Bezzle at Book Passage Corte Madera (Marin County), April 27 https://www.bookpassage.com/event/cory-doctorow-bezzle-martin-hench-novel-corte-madera-store\n\n  * Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (Winnipeg), May 2 https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/cory-doctorow-tickets-798820071337\n\n  * Wordfest (Calgary), May 3 https://wordfest.com/2024/event/wordfest-presents-cory-doctorow-2/\n\n  * Massy Arts (Vancouver), May 4 https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/solo-reading-cory-doctorow-the-bezzle-tickets-876989167207\n\n  * Tartu Prima Vista Literary Festival, May 5-11 https://tartu2024.ee/en/kirjandusfestival/\n\n  * Tim O\u2019Reilly and Cory Doctorow on \u201cEnshittification\u201d and the Future of AI, May 14 https://www.oreilly.com/live-events/tim-oreilly-and-cory-doctorow-on-enshittification-and-the-future-of-ai/0642572001651/\n\n  * \"Finding the Money\" screening (LA), May 15 https://www.laemmle.com/film/finding-money?date=2024-05-15\n\n  * Media Ecology Association keynote (Amherst, NY), Jun 6-9 https://media-ecology.org/convention\n\n  * American Association of Law Libraries keynote (Chicago), Jul 21 https://www.aallnet.org/conference/agenda/keynote-speaker/\n\n# Recent appearances (permalink)\n\n  * Come sfuggire al \u201cMerdocene\u201d e costruire un Internet migliore (Torino Biennale Tecnologia) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5NC2EZCYBg\n\n  * Show Me The Money Club (The Rideshare Guy) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCETi3XqSds\n\n  * NUOVO BARETTO UTOPIA https://videoteca.kenobit.it/w/azRmQBCenVwjSRz9WCp8JS\n\n# Latest books (permalink)\n\n  * The Bezzle: a sequel to \"Red Team Blues,\" about prison-tech and other grifts, Tor Books (US), Head of Zeus (UK), February 2024 (the-bezzle.org).
