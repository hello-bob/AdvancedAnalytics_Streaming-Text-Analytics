In\nEurope, you\u2019re dead,\u201d he said.\n\nBut it goes deeper than that\u2014there\u2019s a difference in the \u201cgeneral level of\nambition,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are not very ambitious. I should be careful about\ntalking about work-life balance, but the Americans just work harder,\u201d Tangen\ncontinued.\n\nData suggests that Tangen is right\u2014but only by a fine margin. According to the\nEuropean Union, in 2022 the average workweek of people between the ages of 22\nand 65 was 37.5 hours. The longest working weeks recorded were in Greece\u201441\nhours a week\u2014and Poland\u201440.4 hours. By contrast, the Netherlands had the\nshortest working week of 33.2 hours, followed by Germany at 35.3 hours.\n\nMeanwhile, data from the International Labour Organization, last updated in\nJanuary, showed the average hours workers clocked in the U.S. was 38 hours a\nweek. However, of those employees, 13% worked 49 hours or more per week, which\noutstripped the majority of European nations.\n\nMoreover, countries like the U.K. have a statutory requirement entitling staff\nto 28 paid days of leave a year\u2014if you\u2019re a full-time employee. In the U.S. it\nis not a legal requirement for staff to be given any paid time off; however,\naccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average employee who is in\ntheir first year of service takes eight PTO days.\n\nDespite admiring the work ethic of staffers in the U.S., Tangen has made it\nclear he doesn\u2019t agree with the extreme pay packages handed to execs. Last\nyear he told Fortune that CEOs who earn more than, say, $20 million a year,\nare \u201cenriching themselves on our behalf.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like daylight robbery,\u201d he added.\n\nNorges Bank\u2019s investment strategy has certainly leaned into the U.S. trend:\nAfter all, America is home to the Magnificent Seven, which have provided a\nbackbone to the stock market boom and, according to analysts, will continue to\ndo so.\n\nAnd the backing of an institution like Norges Bank Investment Management will\nencourage other investors to jump on board. The group is one of the most\npowerful financial vehicles on the planet: It is the world\u2019s largest single\nowner of global stock markets, controlling 1.5% of shares in the world\u2019s\nlisted companies.\n\nThe organization also owns swaths of high-end property, including a 25% stake\nin London\u2019s Regent Street and an approximately 50% holding in offices in New\nYork\u2019s Times Square and on Washington\u2019s Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nInvestments in the U.S. now represent 46.9% of Norges Bank\u2019s portfolio,\nwhereas a decade ago the U.S. represented just under 30%. Going back a further\n10 years, in 2003, the organization\u2019s investment in America made up just 26.3%\nof all investments.\n\nConversely, in 2003, 59.5% of Norges Bank\u2019s portfolio was invested in European\ncountries, a figure that, by 2023, had fallen to 28.7%.\n\n## The election issue\n\nOf course, like many American investors, Tangen is closely watching the 2024\npresidential elections, which could rock the investing boat.\n\nThe CEO, who as a public servant earns less than $1 million a year, said there\nwere people within the organization who were concerned about the upcoming\nrace, but added: \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t say too much about that. We just invest\nin America in great companies for the long term. It won\u2019t have any\nimplications for how we allocate our capital. We have nearly half the assets\nin America; we will stay invested in America.\u201d\n\nPer the FT, Magnificent Seven stocks make up 12% of Norges Bank\u2019s equity\nholdings, with Tangen adding, there\u2019s \u201can argument for the big getting bigger,\n[and] the winner taking it all.\u201d\n\nThere is, of course, a common thread among all the Magnificent Seven\nbusinesses\u2014and it\u2019s the current favorite phrase of Wall Street: artificial\nintelligence.\n\nAgain, this is an area where, Tangen said, Europe was making life difficult\nfor itself. Tech CEOs are frustrated, he said, by the amount of red tape in\nEurope compared with the U.S.\n\nAdmittedly, even those who are leading the way with AI in the U.S. are asking\nfor guardrails\u2014just ask OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s good, but in America you have a lot of AI and no\nregulation; in Europe you have no AI and a lot of regulation. It\u2019s\ninteresting,\u201d Tangen added.\n\n## Latest in Success\n\n  * 11 hours ago\n  * Success - work hours\n\n## \u2018Americans just work harder\u2019 than Europeans, says CEO of Norway\u2019s $1.6\ntrillion oil fund, because they have a higher \u2018general level of ambition\u2019\n\nBYEleanor Pringle\n\nApril 25, 2024\n\n  * a day ago\n  * Leadership - management advice\n\n## Pharmaceutical giant Bayer\u2019s manager cull will likely affect thousands of\nbosses\u2014and the aspirin inventor thinks it will help its \u2018brilliant\u2019 Gen Z\ngrads to thrive\n\nBYOrianna Rosa Royle\n\nApril 24, 2024\n\n  * 2 days ago\n  * Success - U.K.\n\n## London is the world\u2019s top talent magnet, eclipsing Amsterdam and New York.\nYet it\u2019s this country that beckons most\n\nBYPrarthana Prakash\n\nApril 24, 2024\n\n  * 3 days ago\n  * Success - return to office\n\n## Tata\u2019s consultancy arm cuts bonuses for employees who aren\u2019t in the office\n5 days a week\n\nBYRyan Hogg\n\nApril 22, 2024\n\n  * 3 days ago\n  * Success - Ferrari\n\n## Ferrari\u2019s CEO has nearly doubled its share price since 2021\u2014he credits\nsmaller teams and cutting the company\u2019s \u2018bureaucratic mass index\u2019\n\nBYPrarthana Prakash\n\nApril 22, 2024\n\n  * 7 days ago\n  * Success - Michelin\n\n## French tire-maker Michelin rolls out its own global living wage after\nminimum wages left staff in \u2018survival mode\u2019\n\nBYRyan Hogg\n\nApril 18, 2024\n\n## Most Popular\n\n  * 2 days ago\n  * Tech\n\n## On a crucial earnings call, Musk reminds the world Tesla is a tech company.\n\u2018Even if I\u2019m kidnapped by aliens tomorrow, Tesla will solve autonomy\u2019\n\nBY\n\nApril 24, 2024\n\n  * 2 days ago\n  * Tech\n\n## Spotify CEO Daniel Ek surprised by how much laying off 1,500 employees\nnegatively affected the streaming giant\u2019s operations\n\nBYRyan Hogg\n\nApril 23, 2024\n\n  * 11 hours ago\n  * Success\n\n## \u2018Americans just work harder\u2019 than Europeans, says CEO of Norway\u2019s $1.6\ntrillion oil fund, because they have a higher \u2018general level of ambition\u2019\n\nBY\n\nApril 25, 2024\n\n  * 2 days ago\n  * Personal Finance\n\n## A 60-year-old worker in Texas says she\u2019s dependent on apps that let her get\npaid early: \u2018They get you hooked on having that money\u2019\n\nBYCora Lewis and The Associated Press\n\nApril 24, 2024\n\n  * a day ago\n  * Leadership\n\n## Ryanair CEO dishes advice to Boeing on managing its crises: \u2018Never put a\npilot in charge of an airline\u2019\n\nBY\n\nApril 24, 2024\n\n  * a day ago\n  * Finance\n\n## American Airlines changes its frequent flyer rules\u2014again\n\nBYChris Morris\n\nApril 24, 2024\n\n\u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.
