Or follow us on\nGoogle News!\n\nLithium-ion batteries have been the workhorses of the renewable energy\ntransition since the early 2000s, but the world is changing and so is energy\nstorage. Researchers have been eyeballing a new sodium-ion battery formula\nthat provides for a high level of performance while avoiding the supply chain\nissues that can bedevil conventional Li-ion batteries, and now all that hard\nwork is beginning to pay off.\n\n### Here Comes The New Sodium-Ion Battery From Natron\n\nIn the latest sodium-ion battery news, on April 29, the US startup Natron\nEnergy staked out its claim to the first commercial-scale production of a\nsodium-ion battery in the US when it hit the start button on its factory in\nHolland, Michigan.\n\nSomewhat ironically, the new factory is a repurposed former lithium-ion\nbattery plant. Natron expects the makeover to produce 600 megawatts worth of\nthe new sodium-ion battery per year.\n\nElectric vehicle fans, put away your pom-poms for now. Initially, the new\nfactory will tap into the explosively growing energy storage needs of data\ncenters. In particular, Natron anticipates that the equally explosive growth\nof AI technology will fuel more demand for energy storage and 24/7 power at\ndata centers in the US.\n\nThe 600 megawatts is just for starters. Natron also anticipates that the\nHolland factory will provide a model for future gigawatt-scale factories to\nfollow, with an eye on additional markets, including off-road industrial\nvehicles and EV fast charging stations, as well as the telecom field.\n\nChip in a few dollars a month to help support independent cleantech coverage\nthat helps to accelerate the cleantech revolution!\n\n### Many Helping Hands For The New Sodium-Ion Battery\n\nIf you\u2019re looking forward to a sodium-ion battery for your next electric\nvehicle, you may have to wait a while. In the meantime, Natron\u2019s technology\nfits the bill for large-scale energy storage. CleanTechnica first caught wind\nof the data center angle in July of 2020, when the company announced a new\nround of $35 million in funding from ABB Technology Ventures, NanoDimension\nCapital, and Volta Energy Technologies.\n\n\u201cThe new investors join Chevron, Khosla Ventures, and Prelude on the Natron\nroster, so it looks like things are cooking,\u201d we noted.\n\n\u201cNatron plans to expand its reach in a wide range of scale, from edge and\ndistributed computing to massive data centers and telecom infrastructure,\u201d we\nalso noted.\n\nThe US Department of Energy can also give itself a pat on the back for the new\nsodium-ion battery factory. In September of 2020, the company received a $19.9\nmillion award from the Energy Department\u2019s ARPA-E office for funding high-\nrisk, high-reward projects, with the goal of shepherding the new factory into\nbeing.\n\n\u201cThe project aims to scale up production of Natron Energy\u2019s (Natron) Prussian\nblue electrode sodium-ion batteries by 30x to 18,000 trays per year, and fully\nde-risk the resulting supply chain and products through continuous production\nand sales for six months,\u201d ARPA-E explained. The office also noted that the\ncompany\u2019s 8-kilowatt, 50-volt battery tray is primarily designed to manage\npeak loads at data centers and provide emergency backup power, but emerging\nmarkets like EV fast charging stations and grid-scale storage are also\ntargeted.\n\n\u201cNatron\u2019s tray provides data center operators up to 2x higher power density\nand 10x longer cycle life than existing products, along with superior safety\nperformance,\u201d ARPA-E adds.\n\n### Making Sodium-Ion Batteries Better\n\nThe 19th century writer and geology enthusiast Jules Verne famously cooked up\na sodium battery to power Captain Nemo\u2019s submarine in his 1870 novel 20,000\nLeagues Under the Sea. It\u2019s taken a while, but sodium is finally having a\nmoment.\n\nThe sustainability factor behind the silvery-white metallic element sodium\n(chemical symbol Na from the Latin natrium) has been driving the interest in\nsodium-ion batteries. However, there being no such thing as a free lunch, the\nbattery of the future has been elusive until recent years.\n\nSodium is far more abundant than lithium, but it is also much heavier. In\nterms of energy storage for electric vehicles, lithium beats sodium on driving\nrange.\n\nOn the other hand, the \u201cchemical kinship\u201d between sodium and lithium provides\na helping hand for battery research. \u201cSodium is just below lithium in the\nperiodic table of the elements, meaning their chemical behaviors are very\nsimilar,\u201d Physics Magazine helpfully explained just last week.\n\n\u201cThat chemical kinship allows sodium-ion batteries to \u2018ride the coattails\u2019 of\nlithium-ion batteries in terms of design and fabrication techniques,\u201d they\nadded.\n\nLongtime energy storage researcher Jean-Marie Tarascon of the College of\nFrance was even more forthcoming. \u201cSodium-ion technology is really a clone of\nlithium-ion technology,\u201d he told Physics Magazine.\n\nAside from weight, another challenge has been longevity. The Energy\nDepartment\u2019s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory explained the problem back\nin 2022, describing a weak link as the protective film on the anode of a\nsodium-ion battery, which degrades over time. \u201cThis film is critical because\nit allows sodium ions to pass through while preserving battery life,\u201d the lab\nexplained.\n\nLithium-ion batteries also degrade, but a typical sodium-ion battery degrades\nmuch faster. Developing an electrolyte formula that stabilizes the film has\nbeen a moving target. Natron launched in 2012 with a mission to hit that\ntarget, and apparently they have succeeded after a little more than a decade.\n\n### The Electric Vehicle Angle\n\nThe relatively low cost of sodium-ion batteries also opens up the opportunity\nfor rapid deployment in community electric vehicles, second cars, and other\nshort-range applications that don\u2019t necessarily require an expensive, long-\nrange, fast-charging battery.\n\nBeyond that, other battery innovators are working towards replacing lithium-\nion technology with sodium-ion in highway-worthy EVs. The Swedish startup\nNorthvolt is among those first out of the gate, and more activity in the EV\narea is stirring.\n\nHere in the US, the Energy Department has been lending an assist to sodium-\nbased energy storage innovators. Last October, for example, ARPA-E awarded\n$3,198,085 to the Massachusetts firm 24M Technologies to develop a new sodium-\nion battery specifically for EVs.\n\n\u201c24M\u2019s cell design will incorporate (1) its ultra-thick SemiSolid cathode made\nup of advanced cobalt-free, nickel-free sodium cathode active material, (2) an\nadvanced wide-temperature, fast-charging electrolyte developed using machine\nlearning and automated high-throughput screening technology, and (3) a sodium\nsuper ionic conductor,\u201d ARPA-E explained.\n\nOn the research side, the Energy Department\u2019s Argonne National Laboratory has\nbeen building on its experience with lithium-ion batteries to develop new\nsolutions for a roadworthy sodium-ion battery.\n\nA research team at Argonne developed the lithium nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC)\ncathode material for EV batteries, which General Motors deployed in its Chevy\nVolt and Bolt cars. Commercial interest in NMC battery technology is still\nongoing, but Argonne has moved on to explore new territory.\n\nThe key to the NMC architecture was to arrange the atoms in layers, enabling\nthe lithium to flow more efficiently. Argonne has been replicating the\nstrategy for its new sodium battery research. The result is a layered sodium\nnickel-manganese-iron oxide formula that allows for the efficient insertion\nand extraction of sodium. \u201cThe absence of cobalt in the cathode formula\nmitigates cost, scarcity and toxicity concerns associated with that element,\u201d\nthe lab notes.\n\nAmong other automakers, keep an eye on Stellantis. Earlier this year, the\ncompany let word drop that it has invested in the French sodium-ion energy\nstorage innovator Tiamat.\n\nFollow me @tinamcasey on Bluesky, Threads, Instagramt, and LinkedIn.\n\nPhoto (cropped): New sodium-ion battery from Natron provides for energy\nstorage without conflict minerals.
