I wish Elon Musk had the decency to apologise,\" is\nher message to the company\u2019s billionaire boss.\n\nMs Balan has been waiting a long time.\n\nUntil 2014, she was a rising star within the electric-car company in the US.\n\nIn tribute to her engineering expertise, Ms Balan's initials were engraved\ninto all early Tesla Model S batteries. And she proudly shows off a battery\nshell on camera.\n\nMs Balan recalls chatting to Mr Musk in the lunch queue at the staff canteen\nand says she was happy and successful \u2013 living her dream, after growing up in\nRomania with a lifelong passion for cars.\n\nBut after raising concerns about the safety of braking in Tesla vehicles, in\n2014, she lost her job.\n\nMs Balan won a wrongful-dismissal case, reported in the US press.\n\nBut then, in a long media statement, Tesla claimed she had used company time\nand resources for a secret personal project, which it said was embezzlement -\na crime in the US.\n\nIt is something Ms Balan strongly denies.\n\nTesla has never provided any details about the alleged incident, either to her\nor in public, she says.\n\nThe company also failed to respond to a BBC News request for information about\nit.\n\nMs Balan accuses Tesla of defamation.\n\nAnd while she is currently in remission from stage-3B breast cancer, her\nbiggest worry is she may not live to see her final day in court.\n\nUltimately, Ms Balan says, she has doggedly pursued the case for so long\nbecause she wants to prove her innocence to her son.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m his hero,\" she says.\n\n\"I\u2019m the mommy who does airplanes and cars.\u201d\n\nAnd she does not want him to grow up believing his mother was a thief.\n\nCristina Balan\n\nThe initials CB on a Tesla Model S battery, following Cristina Balan's design\ninput\n\nMs Balan shared with BBC News various communications between herself and Tesla\nfrom her time working there.\n\n\"Everything went south when I realised that they were hiding some critical\nsafety issues,\" she claims.\n\nMs Balan was worried the carpets were curling underneath some pedals \u2013 a\nsimple but potentially lethal design flaw - and said customers had complained.\n\n\"If you cannot push the brake, someone else, outside of a Tesla, can get\ninjured,\" she says.\n\n\"They just had to say, \u2018We realise the carpets are bad - just take them out of\nthe cars.\u2019\"\n\nBut managers rebuffed her concerns and became hostile, Ms Balan claims.\n\nSo she emailed Mr Musk, who had directly encouraged employees to come to him\npersonally with any worries that could affect Tesla\u2019s reputation.\n\n\"I emailed him two emails,\" Ms Balan says.\n\n\"I sent him one before I was out [of Tesla], telling him that we are all\nthreatened\n\n\"I was thinking in my head, 'He still wants to do what\u2019s right for Tesla.'\"\n\nBut it failed \u2013 and Ms Balan went on to lose her job.\n\nBBC News put her claims to Tesla but received no response.\n\nThe company's website says: \"Safety is the most important part of every Tesla.\n\n\"We design our vehicles to exceed safety standards\".\n\nAnother Tesla whistleblower, Lukasz Krupski, recounted a similar, unrelated\nexperience after emailing Mr Musk over concerns about working conditions at\nTesla\u2019s Norway headquarters.\n\nAnd Ms Balan says other Tesla staff may be \u201cafraid to speak up\u201d.\n\nHer case will eventually be heard in the California Ninth Circuit Court of\nAppeal - but there is no date for it yet.\n\nIt is her only chance of professional vindication, Ms Balan says.\n\n\"I don\u2019t want to give up my career,\" she says.\n\n\"And I know that if I\u2019m not winning this, it doesn\u2019t matter how good I am.\n\n\u201cEverybody will look at what Tesla say about [me], so my career is gone.\n\n\"I do not want that.\u201d\n\nReuters\n\nMs Balan took her concerns to Tesla chief executive Elon Musk\n\nMr Musk's leadership style is notoriously unconventional - but some of those\nto have worked for him say he gets results.\n\nDolly Singh, who worked at SpaceX for Mr Musk between 2008 and 2013,\npreviously told BBC News he was an \"incredible leader\".\n\n\"If that wasn't the case, he wouldn't be accomplishing the things that he is,\"\nshe said, in 2022.\n\n\"Yes, it's exhausting to work for Elon.\n\n\"But I think it's a proving ground like nothing else.\"\n\nUS lawyer Gordon Schnell, from the firm Constantine Cannon, says a rising\nnumber of technology-sector workers are becoming whistleblowers.\n\nThe stakes are so high because tech products have \"such a wide impact on the\nworld\", he says.\n\n\"It really touches all of our lives,\" he says.\n\nBut the advice of Mr Schnell, who specialises in representing whistleblowers,\nis to explore every possible option before going public with any claims.\n\n\"There are so many protected channels in so many different industries that a\nwhistleblower can take, where they can get confidential concerns to the proper\ngovernment agencies that are best suited to address those concerns,\" he says.\n\nRelated internet links\n\n## Tesla to settle over fatal Autopilot crash\n\n## Brazil Supreme Court judge opens inquiry into Musk\n\n## Ex-Tesla employee casts doubt on car safety\n\nElon Musk\n\nTesla\n\nRelated\n\n## Tesla lays off more than 10% of its workforce\n\n9 hrs ago\n\nTechnology\n\n## Elon Musk to visit India for meeting with PM Modi\n\n5 days ago\n\nAsia\n\n## Tesla to settle over fatal Autopilot crash\n\n7 days ago\n\nTechnology\n\nMore\n\n2 Apr 2024\n\n## Tesla 'disaster' with fewest deliveries since 2022\n\nElon Musk's electric vehicle company is contending with major challenges, as\nrivals make gains.\n\n2 Apr 2024\n\nBusiness\n\n13 Mar 2024\n\n## Watch: Musk and son visit Tesla plant after fire\n\nA far-left activist group took responsibility for the fire, which left the\nplant without power for nearly a week.\n\n13 Mar 2024\n\nEurope\n\n12 Mar 2024\n\n## China tech giant Xiaomi starts electric car sales\n\nThe launch comes as a cut-throat price war intensifies in the world's biggest\ncar market.\n\n12 Mar 2024\n\nBusiness\n\n5 Mar 2024\n\n## Musk attacks 'dumb eco-terrorists' over Tesla fire\n\nProduction at car-maker's factory in Berlin has been halted after suspected\narson attack.\n\n5 Mar 2024\n\nTechnology\n\n4 Mar 2024\n\n## Tesla factory expansion plan sparks treetop protest\n\nEnvironmentalists in Germany have occupied part of a forest earmarked for\nclearance.\n\n4 Mar 2024\n\nEurope\n\n## Let us know you agree to cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best online experience.\n\nPlease let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.\n\n  * No, take me to settings\n\n", "frontpage": true}
