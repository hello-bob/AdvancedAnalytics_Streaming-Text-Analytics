Photo provided by Khaled Mohammed El-Hissy\n\nAs a child, my mom taught me that true love is found in friendships. When I\ngrew up and entered university, I became friends with three pure-hearted\nindividuals: Mahmoud, Mohammed and Khaled. Throughout our university journey,\nour bonds deepened, transforming us into the closest of friends. I fervently\nwished life\u2019s path would never force us apart and that we would always be\nthere for one another. Sadly, this was not to be.\n\nThe first time I met Mahmoud, I asked him for help with the linguistics\nmidterm exam. Despite our competitiveness, he graciously invited me to his\nhouse. Since then, we were inseparable. During my junior year, my circle of\nfriends widened. Mahmoud, Mohammed, and Khaled became my best friends. We were\nall specializing in the same field, so we were always together, either in\nclass or out. When together, our grins never left our faces. (See the\npicture!)\n\nOn Nov. 1, 2022, the Global Undergraduate Exchange Program (UGRAD) opened its\ndoors for new applicants. Mahmoud and I went into gear. We gave it our best\nshot. Almost every step of the application was done together, from the\nrecommendation letters to the official transcript papers. Though both of us\nwere strong candidates, and I had my own dreams of traveling, I wished to be\nrejected to improve Mahmoud\u2019s odds. I couldn\u2019t bear seeing him rejected again.\n\nYou see, it wasn\u2019t Mahmoud\u2019s first time applying for scholarships.\n\nMahmoud had strived for years to earn a scholarship. After finishing secondary\nschool, Mahmoud\u2019s biggest dream was to travel and study abroad. His words echo\nin my ears: \u201cI wanted to study anywhere. Even Egypt, any country, rather than\nstay here and continue in Gaza.\u201d\n\nMahmoud applied to about 30 scholarships, but none replied.\n\nHope began to fade, but a glimpse of light finally appeared when he was\naccepted into a program in the U.S. But Mahmoud couldn\u2019t afford to pay.\nDiscouraged and depressed, and seeing his dreams dashed. Mahmoud didn\u2019t\nregister at university that year. He started working with his uncle in\ndistributing drinks for local shops.\n\nBut Mahmoud wasn\u2019t so easily discouraged. Mahmoud became laser-focused on his\nstudies, majoring in English language and literature. During his two\nuniversity years, each semester Mahmoud achieved the highest cumulative GPA\namong his peers.\n\nOne afternoon, after a long day of classes, Mahmoud and I found ourselves\nseated in our favorite corner of the campus courtyard. The sun, low in the\nsky, cast a warm, golden hue over our weary faces. We sighed in relief, happy\nto finish the week. Mahmoud grabbed his phone and started browsing. Suddenly\nhe turned to me with excitement. \u201cKhaled, I want to tell you something!\u201d\n\nI thought he got a high exam result, as usual. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just received an email informing me I\u2019ve been awarded the UGRAD\nscholarship.\u201d His words filled the air with anticipation, washing away the\nfatigue of the week.\n\nI pulled him into a hug. \u201cAlf Mubarak ya Sahbi!\u201d (Congratulations, my friend.)\n\u201cAlf Mubarak ya Hoda! You finally did it!\u201d\n\nIt was one of the best days of my life when Mahmoud got the good news. He was\naccepted into a highly competitive and renowned program. I was thrilled to\nhave been part of his journey.\n\nOn Aug. 6, 2023, I embraced Mahmoud, holding back the tears so he could not\nsee the void his absence would leave. Walking home that night, I wept tears of\njoy but wished the days apart would pass quickly so I could see Mahmoud again.\nMahmoud traveled to Egypt and on to the U.S., taking short-term residence in\nVermont.\n\nAs it turns out, Mahmoud was even luckier than we realized, because in a\ncouple of months, our lives were about to change forever.\n\nAs the barbaric aggression on Gaza began on Oct. 7, our lives hung in the\nbalance.\n\nCommunication became nearly impossible; we could neither meet nor exchange\neven the briefest of texts due to the days-long absence of internet. The\nsituation worsened for me personally as I received a diagnosis of blood cancer\n\u2014 leukemia. Enduring not just one but two wars, I found myself in a hospital\nwhere the outside world echoed with the unsettling sounds of weapons and the\npain of my illness pulsed through my veins.\n\nAs I battled leukemia, the struggle for medical care pushed me to evacuate to\nRafah and seek treatment in Jordan. In this desperate journey, I left behind\nmy life, family, and friends in Gaza, uncertain if I would ever see them\nagain.\n\nA few days later, I couldn\u2019t reach Khaled and Mohammed.\n\nThe news hit me hard: Mohammed and his family were all killed in a bombing.\n\nI kept texting him, hoping for a reply, but there was only silence. I felt\noverwhelming pain, crying for hours. In some moments, I regret that I left. I\nwish I was gone with him. Worried about Khaled, I called him repeatedly,\nrelieved to hear he was alive. Thankfully, Mahmoud was abroad on his\nscholarship, and safe, but he couldn\u2019t sleep, terrified for his family\u2019s\nsafety.\n\nAnd now, moments of silence usurp my thoughts as I want to sleep. How can I\nsleep placidly after losing all these dear people? When I see their pictures\nor videos of us together, hear a voice that sounds like theirs, or remember\ntimes we spent together, I feel a crack open within me. Is it that simple? I\nwill not hear their voices anymore? We won\u2019t go out again? Is it that simple\nthat I will not talk with Mohammed on WhatsApp? My last message I sent to him\nwill remain one tick forever? Will it ever turn to two ticks? Will the two\nticks ever turn blue? Just like that? That\u2019s it? Is it that simple? He\u2019s gone?\nForever?\n\nHow was he killed? Melted with the intensity of the heat? He couldn\u2019t bear the\npressure of six floors of rubble? Did he suffocate? Were his bones fractured\ncompletely and he couldn\u2019t bear the pain? Did he bleed to death? Where is his\nbody? Can I see him at least? Even if he is dead?! Can\u2019t I?! On what day was\nhe bombed? On what day did he succumb to his wounds? Was he buried? Where was\nhe buried? Where is his grave? Can I at least visit his grave?!\n\nSo many questions and no clear answers. Because there is no grave, no body. No\none can get him from under the rubble. There is only me who can get our photos\nand videos from under my destroyed studio. There is only me who can watch our\nmemories. His family is all dead: there is only me who will shed tears.\n\nHabibi Mohammed, I think of you every day. I miss you so much. You left us too\nearly. I never imagined I wouldn\u2019t be able to see you again. You promised to\ncome and visit me here. Please know that I am still waiting for you, so pass\nby whenever you want \u2014 even if in my dreams.\n\nDreams come true sometimes. I still don\u2019t believe you are gone\n\nThe four friends relaxing together in better times. Photo provided by Khaled\nMohammed El-Hissy\n\nHabibi Mohammed, I have so many things I want to tell you. I want to see you\nand hug you. I want to walk with you through the Rimal neighborhood and buy\nfalafel sandwiches from al-Sosi. I will make sure to buy you two sandwiches\nwith extra red pepper \u2014 just like you always asked for. Mohammed, it\u2019s\nRamadan. Do you remember last year\u2019s Ramadan? I spent half of the month\u2019s\nnights in your home\u2014praying Taraweeh prayers in the nearby mosque and reading\nthe Qur\u2019an the whole night till dawn. Sometimes we would stay home, make\nindomie noodles and watch Konan Anime.\n\nI never liked omelets, Mohammed. Even when my mother makes them, I don\u2019t eat\nthem. But I always ate the omelets your mother made. I would give anything to\nsit with you again while Om al-Abed made us omelets.\n\nAnd what of Khaled? For now, he is alive. His fate remains undecided. He is\nthe last of our circle left in Gaza. I would still be with him in Gaza, if not\nfor the leukemia that brought me to Jordan, to safety. One Khaled is in Gaza.\nOne Khaled in Jordan. Who of us is the more fortunate? This is the kind of\nquestion that Israel\u2019s brutal attacks have caused. To wonder if it\u2019s better to\nbe cancer-free in Gaza, or fighting cancer in Jordan. How ironic that having\ncancer might be the thing that saves my life.\n\nEven though I\u2019m not in Gaza anymore, the pain of loss lingers.\n\nI find myself wishing for one more sleepover with my friends. Will I see\nMahmoud and Khaled again? The uncertainty hangs in the air, and I hold onto\nthe hope of reuniting with them someday.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Read here tributes to Mohammed Zaher Hamo, killed Nov. 24, 2023\n\nMentor: Bisanne Masoud\n\n### Share this post\n\nFacebook Twitter LinkedIn Google + Email\n\n#### Recent Posts\n\n#### Naked, afraid ... and resilient\n\nFive lunar cycles since the attack began.
