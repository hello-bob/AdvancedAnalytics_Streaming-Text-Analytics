FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nPublished April 23, 2024 11:53pm EDT | Updated April 24, 2024 2:22pm EDT\n\n# Coinbase dunks on traditional payment methods in $15M NBA ad spend\n\n## 'These ads capture something bigger than just Coinbase,' Chief Policy\nOfficer Shirzad shared\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Comments\n  * Print\n  * Email\n\nBy Eleanor Terrett FOXBusiness\n\nCoinbase is launching a $15 million TV ad campaign that aims to tout the\nmerits of cryptocurrency and exhibit the pitfalls of traditional payment rails\nin a language that sports fans understand: Pizza.\n\nFOX Business has learned that the U.S.\u2019s largest crypto exchange is set to run\nthree separate commercials across four channels showing the NBA playoffs\nstarting Wednesday.\n\nThe idea behind the commercials, news of which hasn\u2019t been reported yet, is to\nunderscore how complex and expensive traditional payment methods are compared\nto crypto, which is settled almost instantly and cuts out the so-called\n\"middleman\" like banks and payment service providers.\n\n\"We\u2019re under the illusion that when we use credit cards or Venmo, things are\nhappening instantly, but they're actually just part of very complex plumbing\nthat\u2019s masked by a digital interface,\" Coinbase\u2019s chief policy officer Faryar\nShirzad tells FOX Business.\n\nAMAZON INTRODUCES UNLIMITED GROCERY DELIVERY SUBSCRIPTION WITH PRIME\n\nA representation of the cryptocurrency is seen in front of Coinbase logo in\nthis illustration taken, March 4, 2022. (Reuters/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File\nPhoto / Reuters Photos)\n\nTo demonstrate the complex plumbing, the tongue-in-cheek ad shows the process\na large pepperoni pizza would go through if it was money in today\u2019s payment\nsystem. The commercial begins with the pizza going through several stages of\napproval and authorization. The narrator is heard saying \"If pizza worked like\nthis, you wouldn\u2019t like pizza.\"\n\nThe pie then moves along an assembly line, illustrating the multiple stages of\na typical credit card transaction. People even take bites of the pizza,\nsymbolizing the intermediaries taking a proverbial slice of the pie. The\nnarrator says \"this is pretty much what happens to your money whenever you\nspend it or send it.\"\n\nFinally, the half-eaten pizza gets put into a box and rushed through a door\nmarked \"surcharge,\" to indicate the hidden fees customers pay on their\ntransactions.\n\nIt's estimated that hidden fees, or \"junk fees,\" cost Americans around $90\nbillion per year, or more than $650 per household, according to the White\nHouse.\n\nThe commercial ends with the pie getting picked up by a delivery driver who\nturns to the camera and says, \"we deserve a better system, easier, simpler,\nfaster. That\u2019s how crypto works.\"\n\n\"Crypto is a solve for Americans who are fed up with the middlemen taking a\nbite every time they order and pay for pizza,\" Jesse Pollak, Coinbase's vice\npresident of engineering and creator of Base, told FOX Business. \"Coinbase is\nbuilding the future of money to make sure American consumers own their own pie\n\u2013 and making sure their payment moves at the speed of the internet.\"\n\nPOPULAR TEX-MEX CHAIN CLOSING SEVERAL LOCATIONS IN 4 STATES\n\nIn this photo illustration a Coinbase logo seen displayed on a smartphone.\n(Mateusz Slodkowski/SOPA Images/LightRocket / Getty Images)\n\nThe 60-second ad and two 30-second ads will air starting Wednesday on TNT,\nESPN, ESPN2 and ABC and run through June 9.\n\nPizza seems to be a reccurring theme in Coinbase\u2019s ads. The latest spots,\nwhich cost Coinbase $15 million, come just two days after the conclusion of\nits Bitcoin pizza ad, which aimed to show Bitcoin\u2019s increasing value over time\nby illustrating how much pizza a person could buy with one bitcoin in 2012\ncompared to 2024. The ad has been viewed over 3 million times on X.\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges are shelling out top dollar to run ads during next\nSunday\u2019s Super Bowl between the Los Angeles Rams and Cincinnati Bengals.\n(Photo illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images / Getty Images)\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO\n\nCoinbase\u2019s marketing blitz comes as Congress inches closer to passing\nlegislation on so-called stablecoins \u2014 cryptocurrency that mimics the dollar.\nLegislation introduced in the Senate last week is the latest in a series of\nbipartisan bills in both chambers of Congress that aim to establish\ncomprehensive federal oversight of stablecoins and their integration into the\nU.S. financial system.\n\n\"Stablecoins are actually a huge unlock for consumers who currently have to\npay fees that they just can't afford and for merchants who pay fees that they\ncan't afford,\" said Shirzad. \"It's not that complicated to regulate stablecoin\nissuance and so there's no reason why you can't get agreement on a bipartisan\nbasis to get this done.\"\n\n## U.S. Stock Market Quotes\n\nQuotes displayed in real-time\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArrives Weekly\n\nGet Our Newsletter\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews,\nmarket updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nSubscribe\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of\nUse, and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox\nNews.
