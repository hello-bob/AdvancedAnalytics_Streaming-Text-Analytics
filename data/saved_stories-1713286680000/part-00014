This decision aims to foster\na larger community of Arkindex users and accelerate the platform's\ndevelopment.\n\n### Why go Open Source?\n\nThe decision to transition Arkindex to an open-source model stems from our\ncommitment to three core objectives:\n\n  * Accessibility for all: Accessibility is at the heart of this initiative. We believe that everyone, from individual researchers to large institutions, should have access to world-class document AI based processing tools. Open-sourcing Arkindex breaks down barriers and makes it easily accessible to a wider audience.\n  * Ensuring longevity and investment security: the decision to open source Arkindex is a strategic move aimed at ensuring long-term durability and ongoing support. This decision reassures users and organizations that their investment in Arkindex is secure. By opening up the code base, we are ensuring that Arkindex remains a sustainable and evolving solution that adapts to technological advances and user needs.\n  * Expanding the user community: By making Arkindex open source, we aim to welcome a wider audience of users and contributors. This not only enriches the platform with diverse perspectives but also fosters a strong sense of community among users from diverse backgrounds.\n\n### Licenses\n\nStarting today we offer Arkindex under two editions:\n\n  * Community Edition is the open-source version, you can use it freely for all your open-source projects.\n  * Enterprise Edition is available to our customers, with extended support, help and training available. It can scale to hundreds of GPU-enabled servers, and even support super-computers through slurm.\n\nWant to know more ? We have a more detailed documentation page.\n\n### Arkindex: A Closer Look\n\nArkindex is not just a tool, it's a complete solution for the automated\nprocessing of digitized documents. It offers a range of features to meet\ndifferent document management and analysis needs:\n\n  * Versatile document management: Easily import, organize and manage images in a variety of formats. Arkindex is based on IIIF.\n  * Detailed manual annotation: Tools for annotating images, transcribing text and adding classifications and metadata.\n  * Automated processing capabilities: Includes layout analysis, OCR/HTR for text recognition and named entity extraction.\n  * Advanced workflow management: Customize, monitor and adapt complex workflows to meet different processing requirements.\n  * Seamless integration and accessibility: Custom integration of any algorithm using Docker and fully accessible via a REST API for easy integration.\n  * Collaborative annotation campaigns through its companion tool Callico\n\n### Roadmap\n\nArkindex is our main product and we'll keep maintaining and developing it now,\nand in the long term.\n\nHere is a roadmap of the main changes you can expect to see in the next\nmonths:\n\n  * Better build system for the frontend using vite and Typescript (July 2024)\n  * Simpler worker updates using Docker images instead of Git repositories (Summer 2024)\n  * Complete tutorial to guide users across building and using segmentation, transcription and classification Machine Learning models with Arkindex (Summer 2024)\n  * Centralized Machine Learning models repository to share and sell models (Autumn 2024)\n  * Support of Machine Learning metrics using existing best in-class tools (Winter 2024)\n\n### Join the Arkindex Community\n\nWe invite individuals and organizations interested in document processing to\nexplore and contribute to Arkindex.
