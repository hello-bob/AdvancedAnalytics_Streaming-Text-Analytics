The new method of\nmapping the stories through common languages and geographical proximity\nworked, \u201cbecause in oral tradition, folk tales are transmitted through spoken\nlanguage, so a correlation might be expected; and also because both languages\nand folk tales are transmitted from generation to generation.\u201d\n\nTehrani said their study agreed with Grimm\u2019s theory: \u201cSome of these stories go\nback much further than the earliest literary record and indeed further back\nthan classical mythology \u2013 some versions of these stories appear in Latin and\nGreek texts \u2013 but our findings suggest they are much older than that.\u201d\n\nAnalysis showed Jack and the Beanstalk was rooted in a group of stories\nclassified as The Boy Who Stole Ogre\u2019s Treasure, and could be traced back to\nwhen eastern and western Indo-European languages split \u2013 more than 5,000 years\nago. Beauty and the Beast and Rumpelstiltskin to be about 4,000 years old. A\nfolk tale called The Smith and the Devil was estimated to date back 6,000\nyears to the bronze age.\n\nForgotten fairytales slay the Cinderella stereotype | Philip Oltermann\n\nRead more\n\nThe story, which involves a blacksmith selling his soul in a pact with the\ndevil in order to gain supernatural ability, then tricking the evil power, is\nnot so well known today, but its theme of a Faustian pact is familiar to many.\n\nThe study employed phylogenetic analysis, which was developed to investigate\nevolutionary relationships between species, and used a tree of Indo-European\nlanguages to trace the descent of shared tales on it, to see how far they\ncould be demonstrated to go back in time.\n\nTehrani said: \u201cWe find it pretty remarkable these stories have survived\nwithout being written. They have been told since before even English, French\nand Italian existed. They were probably told in an extinct Indo-European\nlanguage.\u201d\n\nDa Silva believes the stories endure thanks to \u201cthe power of storytelling and\nmagic from time immemorial\u201d.\n\n\u201cBesides, the motifs present in fairytales are timeless and fairly universal,\ncomprising dichotomies such as good and evil; right and wrong, punishment and\nreward, moral and immoral, male and female,\u201d she added. \u201cUltimately, despite\nbeing often disregarded as fictitious, and even as a lesser form of narrative,\nfolk tales are excellent case studies for cross-cultural comparisons and\nstudies on human behaviour, including cooperation, decision making, [and so\non].\u201d\n\nThe author and academic Marina Warner, who has written a history of\nfairytales, called the paper \u201cfascinating\u201d. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting to me is it\nshows how deeply this creative power of the imagination lies in the human\nbeing, how it\u2019s about making sense of your world by inventing narratives that\nresist its difficulties,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the case of The Smith and the Devil,\nit\u2019s a cunning tale \u2013 the trickster tricked, showing a very ancient version of\nthat defiance of difficulty. That capricious chance will play tricks on you,\nbut you, with cunning, will be able to resist that. It\u2019s a kind of joke the\naudience shares to feel a little better.\u201d\n\nBeauty and the Beast, or The Animal Bride, shows a similar kind of imagining,\nshe added. \u201cIt\u2019s making sense of our relationship with the natural world -\neliminating the threat. A beast figure marries a woman, and then the stories\ntake different turns; in one she kills him, in one she finds he turns into a\nman when she kisses him.\u201d\n\nPress Association contributed to this report.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Fairytales\n  * Written language\n  * Spoken word\n  * Language\n  * Anthropology\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Comments (...)\n\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Books\n  * Music\n  * TV & radio\n  * Art & design\n  * Film\n  * Games\n  * Classical\n  * Stage\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
