They question how this aligns with rising prices and wave\nvaguely towards factors like monopoly pricing, hedge funds, Airbnb, vacancies\nand so forth, implying that more construction isn\u2019t the solution. The real\nexplanation for rising prices amid greater homes per capita is actually quite\nsimple, fewer kids. Kevin Erdmann has an excellent post on this going through\nthe numbers in detail. I will illustrate with a stylized example.\n\nSuppose we have 100 homes and 100 families, each with 2 parents and 2 kids.\nThus, there are 100 homes, 400 people and 0.25 homes per capita. Now the kids\ngrow up, get married, and want homes of their own but they have fewer kids of\ntheir own, none for simplicity. Imagine that supply increases substantially,\nsay to 150 homes. The number of homes per capita goes up to 150/400 (.375), an\nall time high! Supply-side skeptics are right about the numbers, wrong about\nthe meaning. The reality is that the demand for homes has increased to 200 but\nsupply has increased to just 150 leading to soaring prices.\n\nNow what do we do about this? One response is to blame people\u2019s\nchoices\u2013immigrants are buying all the houses, hedge funds are buying all the\nhouses, tourists are renting all the houses, everyone should want less and\nconserve more! Going down this path will tear the country apart. The other\nresponse is the American way, in the words of Bryan Caplan\u2019s excellent new\nbook, build, baby, build!\n\nHere\u2019s Kevin:\n\n> We are already 15 years into a cultural and economic battle that is so\n> important, it turned the direction of adults per house upward for, likely,\n> the first time since the start of the industrial revolution. Fifteen years\n> in, by that measure, we have reversed economic progress by nearly 40 years.\n> There is so much ground we have to make up. And, also, the reactionary\n> position will have to continue to dig deeper and get worse \u2013 rounding up\n> immigrants, blaming the homeless, stoking fear and distrust of financial\n> institutions.

US population in 1980 was 227\nmillion of which 81 million were under age 20. So, 146 million adults were\npresent in 1980. That gives us a ratio of 0.6 homes per adult.\n\nIn 2020 we had 140.8 million homes. US population was 331 million. 81 million\nwere under age 20.\n\nWhich still works out to 0.6 (that is we are at the point where rounding and\nmeasurement errors are larger than the difference between the two figures).\n\nMaybe the quick google numbers from Statista and USAFacts are wrong. Maybe I\nam missing something crazy here.\n\nBut remember that Alex's calculation implicitly demands that children occupy\nzero housing space. Which seems silly to me. Yes, kids do not require their\nown homes, but neither do unrelated adults. Beyond the polycules, single\nadults have long split rent to reduce costs (e.g. Friends was seen as\nnormative) and I think it silly to wildly underestimate elasticity of demand\nwhere a reduction in demand for two or three bedroom apartments does not lead\nto marginal increases in supply for adults willing to split rent. And as the\nfraction of the US population has shifted more adult, such building and\nconversion is likely going to shift floor space to match the market. Could be\nwrong, but it seems like a lot of the new apartments are utterly abysmal for\nfamilies living with children (e.g. efficiencies and single bedrooms with\nlittle child friendly design).\n\nThe reality is that housing demand is elastic, folks split rent when prices\nare high and don't when they are low. This is how San Francisco just absorbed\na large fall in adult population with limited impacts on rent.\n\nA decline in kid population of 12% (from 36% to 24% of US population)\ncertainly has impacts, but seems wildly insufficient to account for the\ncurrent dynamics. Particularly when we see single adult households rise from\n30.2% of the total to 35.9% of the sample.\n\nIf adults formed single adult households at the same rate in 2020 that they\ndid in 1980, that is larger than any possible impact from insufficient\nconstruction.\n\nEnd of the day more modern adults want to concentrate in pricey areas, more of\nthem want to live alone (i.e. without another adult in the household), and\nthey want more space than folks had in the 80s.\n\nRespond\n\n### Marshall\n\n2024-04-19 10:56:16\n\n16| 2  \n---|---  \n  \nHide Replies\n\n#\n\nHousing needs to be understood at a regional level, not the national level.\nExcept at the most far-fetched margins, the supply of housing in Lubbock,\nTex., has no effect on the housing-market dynamics of New Haven, Conn.\n\nRespond\n\n### Publius\n\n2024-04-19 12:16:21\n\n5| 1  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nPicking an over extrapolation as a counterexample doesn\u2019t invalidate a point.\n\nYes, Lubbock and New Haven have little to do with each other.

It really doesn't matter what the housing\nsupply/household ratio is. If you look at this chart, you can see that the\nsecondary market has very few units available to purchase based on months of\nsupply. That's because the existing home market inventory is near all-time\nlows. This is primarily due to the fact that existing home-owners carrying\nmortgages have very low mortgage rates (3% or lower). So they are going to be\nreluctant to move and take on a higher mortgage rate (currently around 7%)\nunless they absolutely have no choice (due to job relocation, etc.).\n\nRespond\n\n### Gridlock\n\n2024-04-19 13:17:14\n\n1| 0  \n---|---  \n  \nHide Replies\n\n#\n\nJust to clarify, when I refer to existing home market inventory, it is the\nnumber of homes for sale.

In absolute numbers, neither of\nthese is down on a 55-year time scale. But more tellingly SF has just shed\nsomething north of 5% of its population. At best we have seen limited price\nresponses. And if the literature is to be believed, the overwhelming response\nto relative increase in housing supply was to create new households:\nhttps://eig.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Remote-Work-and-Household-\nFormation.pdf\n\n2) I am also not convinced that \"reversing a trend\" means all that much. We\nhad increasing house prices in 2000-2007 while adults/home was declining. We\nhave increasing house prices now while adults/home is increasing. This\nsuggests that adults/home is not actually all that good at predicting price\nmovement.\n\n3) It would be bizarre to keep average home increasing indefinitely. At some\npoint upkeep time and costs become a meaningful constraint. As you rightly\npoint out, kids per house is going down why would that not effect the\npreferred sizes for buyers and developers to target? This seems particularly\nodd to me when we just had a pandemic with major supply chain disruptions that\nstung both and might be making them more gunshy about larger designs.\n\n4) What exactly is the goal level for adults per home? 0/home? And if it is\nthe metric to drive, what exactly is wrong with taxing unoccupied homes? If it\nis crucial that Americans have as few adults as possible in each home, then I\nam not seeing why an occupancy tax is beyond the pale.\n\nEnd of the day some people prefer low density within the home. Some prefer low\ndensity within the neighborhood. Everybody prefers low prices (except maybe\nrealtors). Three preferences in tension, the two most preferred win out and\nthe third eats the tradeoff.\n\nMaybe you think that market frictions from zoning prohibit tradeoffs between\nthese preferences to re-equilibrate in line with actual preferences. Fine, do\nthe market thing then and create a tradeable property right in zoning, gift it\nto the current controllers (lest we provoke the asymmetries of loss aversion),\nand let the market sort it out via Coasean bargaining.\n\nI mean I actually support building a lot of houses. I just don't believe that\nthe trillion-dollar bill fairy has been visiting the ground here. If you want\nmore homes, somebody has to pay for them. Maybe they pay in reduced home\nvaluation (e.g. where views make up something like 10% of the value of homes).\nMaybe they pay in congestion, lack of privacy in their backyards, or a hundred\nother things. Maybe they pay by passing a municipal bond to buy out the NIMBY\nvoters. But somebody pays, and when you make a subset of folks pay through\nconcentrated explicit loss that is a recipe for costly, adversarial processes\nthat eat up the gains (i.e. the 15 years YIMBYs have spent doing the same\nthing and expecting different results).\n\nSo I prefer to avoid costly, destructive adversarial processes and just opt to\npay enough to buy out the NIMBYs. Maybe that value is too high (in which case\nmaybe the preference for living alone is not more valuable than the preference\nfor living in low density), but let's trust the market and property rights to\nwork their magic without an uncompensated takings from the current permission\nholders.\n\nAnd if we put zoning rights in the market, then we can establish explicit\nprices - how much do people value their low density? How much does it cost to\nbuy them out. How much do people value living alone? How much can a developer\nhope get in higher rent at higher density?\n\nEnd of the day you calculate that an increase in 4 million occupied houses\ngets us back to some viable price point fine. I see no reason why policy\nshould be towards building homes rather than reducing single adult households.\nBoth density within the home and density within the neighborhood are both\nvalid preferences where folks can decide. It just seems like a wildly cheaper\nand easier political lift to say eliminate the marriage penalties to increase\nmarriage and cohabitation rates by 1% than building a couple of million new\nhomes.\n\nRespond\n\n### mkt42\n\n2024-04-19 12:03:30\n\n4| 0  \n---|---  \n  \nHide Replies\n\n#\n\n\"Which still works out to 0.6\"\n\nWhat's missing from this analysis is that you're looking at just one market\nindicator, namely quantity (or a version of it; not literally the quantity of\nhouses but rather housing per capita). And not accounting for the other one,\nprice.\n\nWe could e.g. see sharp increases in demand and sharp decreases in supply that\nleave the quantity unchanged. And prices would naturally be higher. Big shifts\nhappened, but quantity was unchanged.\n\nDecades ago, some housing economists came up with the idea of \"nucleons\" for\nhousehold formation. A family with two children might occupy one household.\nThen the kid become 18 years old and move out. Or maybe they're 30 years old\nand still living at home. Ditto grandparents living with the family, or not.\nAnd the whole living with roommates thing.\n\nThere are a lot of ways that household nucleons can split off, or combine into\na single household. Generally, there's a positive income elasticity with\nregard to nucleons moving out and living separately, i.e. with higher incomes,\nfamilies tend to prefer to split up instead of having three generations living\ntogether, much less having some aunts and uncles and cousins also under the\nsame roof.\n\nThe notion of calling these family subgroups nucleons doesn't seem to have\npersisted. But the idea that people, when they have enough income, will want\nto live in their own household or their own nucleon's household, is readily\nfamiliar and is surely a big part of the rise of housing demand. Alex's story\nis an example of the bigger principle of nucleons and household formation.\n\nRespond\n\n### Sure\n\n2024-04-19 12:17:20\n\n245| 5  \n---|---  \n  \nHide Replies\n\n#\n\nI am not against people having preferences to live in single adult households.\nWhat bugs me is that once people make that decision, the price of housing goes\nup, and goes up for everyone. But then rather than believe that people have\nagency to manage their living situation, it suddenly becomes imperative to\nlower the costs of them realizing their desire for independent home ownership.\n\nPeople have a preference for more living space, fewer folks in the household,\nand the rest as income goes up. Fine. Why does that preference trump the\npreferences of current homeowners for low density - be it valuable views,\nschool district quality, traffic, or whatever?\n\nI maintain that right now we are watching several different preferences\ngetting valued in real time: the preference to live alone, the preference to\nlive in low density neighborhoods (and their correlates like good schools),\nand the preference for cheap housing. Enough people value the first and second\nhigh enough and the third too little so we equilibrate to a higher price. If\npeople valued cheap housing more than living alone, they would pair off with\nroommates or spouses at higher rates. If people valued cheap housing more than\nviews and low density - then they would sell and move outward or upward.\nInstead, the empirical elasticities I see suggest that people just do not\nvalue lower costs as much as lower density in the house or in the\nneighborhood.\n\nAnd as with anytime you have three preferences in tension, there will all\nsorts of ways to trade off between them and all sorts of ways that you might\nuse collective decision making to pick the \"optimal\" set of tradeoffs. NIMBYs\nwant strict local democracy where most of the costs are born by folks who\nprefer low density within the home. YIMBYs want regional or national\npreemption where most of the costs are born by folks who prefer low density\nwithin the neighborhood. What we are getting these days is an equilibrium\nwhere everyone just pays more for housing. And that is not exactly irrational\ngiven how much wealthier Americans have gotten in real terms over the last 40\nyears.\n\nRespond\n\n### Student\n\n2024-04-19 13:08:40\n\n226| 1  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nI made essentially the same comment elsewhere.\n\nSo here I\u2019ll make a tongue in cheek comment... which is more accurate than we\nwill like to admit.\n\nWomen are primarily responsible for the high cost of housing costs and men\nprimarily bear those costs.\n\nWomen are the gate keepers to marriages.

People demand more electricity over time, wouldn't this argument lead you\nto think we shouldn't build more power plants. Power plants are often ugly,\nenvironmentalists would argue we should moderate our demand instead of\nbuilding more. I think most people understand this approach is misguided\nthough, we just want cheap energy.\n\nRespond\n\n### Sure\n\n2024-04-19 20:49:27\n\n92| 2  \n---|---  \n  \nHide Replies\n\n#\n\nBut people don't just want cheap energy. They want their energy to be safe\n(e.g. no Chernobyls), they want it to be clean (no fly ash in the air at their\nkids' school), they want it to be reliable (no unbuffered wind), they want it\nto be harmonious with nature (no clear-cutting old growth forests to install\nsolar arrays), etc. And even more complicated not everyone values each of\nthose the same.\n\nSo how do we sort stuff like that out? We can turn to democracy or we can turn\nto markets. Markets will discover how much everyone is willing to pay to have\nsafety, reliability, cleanliness, and so forth. Sometimes we vote on it. In\neither event we balance among competing priorities first by acknowledging that\nthey are competing priorities and then by trying not to shaft one set of folks\nwithout recompense.\n\nIf we build a noxious power plant, folks can sue if it pollutes the air. Maybe\nwe use eminent domain to seize their property - then we are supposed to pay\nfair market rate in recompense.\n\nAt base, density disamenities are perceived the same way by people - something\nimposed upon them (be it traffic, declining school quality, or loss of value\nenhancing views).\n\nEnd of the day all the YIMBY case is just pure moralizing. How dare people\nvalue their neighborhood as its own right. How dare anyone have constrained my\ndevelopment rights unless it was with an HOA or deed restriction because those\ntotally legit because they use a different legal mechanism to achieve exactly\nthe same end.\n\nSome people want to live alone, around 20 million more than was the previous\nnorm. That preference increases the cost of housing. Some people want to live\nin low density neighborhoods, that preference is expressed though zoning\nelections and increases the cost of housing. Why we should do nothing that\nmight impact the first, not even remove facially discriminatory marriage\npenalties in welfare eligibility, but ascribe precisely zero to the second is\nbeyond me.\n\nAnd pragmatically? It has been 15 years. And we have gotten a few places to\nallow a bit easier time building multifamily housing.

Basically, you want property owners who pay a lot of taxes and\nconsume very little in social services (schools, etc.). Lower-income families\nin small houses, condos or apartments are likely to consume a lot of social\nservices, but they, or their landlords, will pay little in property taxes on a\nper-unit basis as each unit isn't worth that much. It's better to require low-\ndensity and let low-income households live in the next town over and commute\nto your town to do the manual labor. This is a bigger problem in places like\nLA County where there are a lot of small localities clustered together. You\ncould mitigate this problem by shifting to a per-unit fee (like an HOA fee),\nbut that's just how property taxes work.\n\nRespond\n\n### Sure\n\n2024-04-19 21:17:48\n\n0| 1  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nBut this is part of the point.

Why exactly is it that we never seem to be\nable to just buy out the NIMBY concerns. Why must we trade wide aggregate\nbenefit against local taxpayers taking it on the chin?

With increasing longevity among the elderly, more\nfolks are meeting criteria for joint replacement or flat living long enough to\nget cancer. That means more work for surgeons and oncologists. And on it goes.\n\nAmericans have generally been adopting less healthy habits (with the sole\nexception of smoking, but enough of those health impacts are lagged enough\nthat we are only beginning to see reduced demand) but we have been keeping\nthem alive longer (minus the suicide and drug cases).\n\nAdd in a heavy penchant for medicalizing all the troubles of life (e.g.\nanxiety, distractability, teenage angst are all far more likely to be\nmedicalized today) and demand is up quite a lot.\n\nAnd this is part of why I am not a fan of saying that demand can be ignored on\ntime series. We brought down the number of new physicians in the 80s and 90s,\nwe increased demand (trivially so for objective measures in places like rads\nand path), and then we saw physician pay shrink in relative terms. Then in the\n2010s we started having substantial increases in the number of physicians\nexiting residency and even practicing. And we saw pay go up.\n\nYou can tell epicycle laden stories to preserve a solely supply side issue.\nBut the big thing is that demand, monopoly power, monopsony power, and\nregulation all played a roll. And for most complicated markets that is always\ntrue.\n\nI expect more houses to lower prices relative to a counterfactual. But I would\nalso expect less demand to lower home prices.

Which is bizarre to me. People living alone tend to create costly\nexternalities. They have higher healthcare costs (e.g. nobody to change\ndressings). They are lonelier (e.g. more likely to be committed inpatient,\nmore likely to commit suicide). They use more resources to maintain living\nspace (e.g. heating fuel, miles of sewage piping). They create relative\ndisamenities for everyone else (e.g. dual adult households make fewer grocery\nstore runs per week per capita, ceteris paribus).\n\nIf we could get ~1.6% of single adult households to fuse with another single\nadult household we get the entire impact of his 4 million new homes. That is\nnot a huge effect size. It is plausibly within the range for eliminating the\nmarriage penalties for SNAP, CHIP, and the rest (and those are plausibly\ncheaper than the long-run costs of prolonged or perpetual singleness).\n\nBut even ignoring this odd monomaniacal focus only on housing supply to reach\nan oddly weird goal, why exactly is the only way to get it to use government\nfiat and preemption at the expense of the amenities enjoyed by current owners?\nHe blithely ignores the very real option of just taxing unoccupied housing\n(vacation homes, AirBnBs, whatever).

Erdmann decries *fifteen\nyears* of failure and never even seems to blink that maybe we should stop\ndoing the same thing while expecting different results. Maybe we should, I\ndunno, trust the market? Maybe we should take a public concern that is\n(allegedly) mismanaged, as he contends zoning is, and create a property right,\nassign it to the folks who currently enjoy it (to avoid the assymetrical\nimpacts from loss aversion relative to the status quo) and then let the\nbidding commence.\n\nErdmann just has a morality tale. It might even be correct. Be it has been,\nand will be, a recipe for prolonged conflict which will consume real\nresources.\n\nTrying, literally, any other approach is likely a wiser bet at this point.\nMake common cause with the social conservatives to nudge folks towards\nmarriage and away from single adult households, make common cause with left\npopulists to tax second homes and AirBnBs to buy out the NIMBYs, commoditize\nzoning rights and let the market sort it out ... but instead he remains\nexclusively committed to the hammer that has failed to find a poundable nail\nfor fifteen years because that is what the morality play demands.\n\nRespond\n\n### A\n\n2024-04-19 11:48:37\n\n3| 0  \n---|---  \n  \nHide Replies\n\n#\n\nI live with my ex boyfriend, because the cost of living alone is too high.\nMarriage is not the answer here.

If mortgages have high rates, so is\nborrowing for business.\n\nYou can change tax treatment of homes though, or regulations around salary\nmultiple and deposit limits.\n\nBut those seem to me that they would generally be disfavourable to first time\nbuyers and those who have just got on the ladder. \"You can now borrow less\nrelative to your salary. Can't remortgage and you're disfavoured relative to\npeople with liquid family wealth? Sorry about that.\"\n\nChanging the headline house price without changing the cost of month-to-month\nmortgage owners only really changes things for cash buyers... who first time\nbuyers are unlikely to be, without familial wealth.\n\nRespond\n\n### Publius\n\n2024-04-19 12:53:21\n\n0| 1  \n---|---  \n  \nHide Replies\n\n#\n\nAmericans are convinced their home is their biggest investment, they\u2019re\nwilling to turn housing into a Ponzi scheme since they think policies that\nincrease home values positively affect their lives... forgetting about where\nthey\u2019ll live and property taxes.\n\nRespond\n\n### Sure\n\n2024-04-19 13:24:45\n\n4| 0  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nHomes are one of the few areas where it is easy to invest with leverage.\nParticularly as young individuals with little to lose in bankruptcy, you are\nlargely playing with bank money and stand to utterly clobber the returns you\ncan get on any investment you purchase without leverage.\n\nAnd there is long historical precedence that falling home prices are bad.\nHistorically that happened because a bunch of people died, fled, or were\nenslaved.\n\nAnd with few exceptions, that has largely held up. Maybe in the early 20th\ncentury housing prices went down while standards of living rose. But the\nperiods with flat or falling home prices have been periods of unemployment,\nstagflation, or open warfare. And when the good times returned, housing costs\nwent up.\n\nBut is this mistaking correlation and causation? Some. But all the housing\ndiscussions overlook the fact that housing quality has vastly improved in just\n80 years. Electrification and indoor plumbing. Square footage allotment (per\nperson or per adult). Driveway parking -> car ports -> garages -> multiple car\ngarages. Air conditioning. Heating efficiency. And on it goes.\n\nAnd a not unreasonable amount of that is even stuff that the average American\ncan produce with sweat equity. Which means they get the rewards of their labor\nunmediated by taxation.\n\nIt is not unreasonable that homes go up in value. At the end of the day, we\nhave been having more people and not a lot of new land to show for it.\n\nRespond\n\n### The Good Bill\n\n2024-04-19 07:23:54\n\n30| 21  \n---|---  \n  \nHide Replies\n\n#\n\nA bit too typical of Alex -- he has a halfway decent point, but feels the need\nto slander people as \"anti-immigrant\" for absolutely no reason while\nattempting to make it.\n\nRespond\n\n### RG\n\n2024-04-19 07:52:31\n\n32| 14  \n---|---  \n  \nHide Replies\n\n#\n\nImagine yakking on and on about the housing supply crisis, then calling ppl\nanti-immigrant bc they point put the insanity of a de facto open border policy\nin the middle of a housing crisis.\n\nThis page is a hoot.\n\nRespond\n\n### Sure\n\n2024-04-19 10:43:25\n\n5| 1  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nAccording to Erdmann, we reach the promise land with 4 million new occupied\nhomes.\n\nOkay, how many immigrants have we had come here since 2008? Well the census\nfolks tell us that we take in over a million immigrants a year, every year.\nCutting the immigration rate in half for 4 years should literally do the same\nthing as Erdman desires.\n\nOr consider the number of single adult households. In 2022, 37% of households\nhad a single adult in them (single adult with or without kids). Getting to his\nmagical 4 million homes means dropping all the way down to ... 34% of the\npopulation living as single adults.\n\nWhich is within plausible range for simple things like eliminating marriage\npenalties for various welfare cutoffs.\n\nWhich is the real thing here. Erdman tells us that the folks looking at the\nall-time record housing inventory, the all-time record housing inventory per\ncapita, and one of the 10 lowest years for adults per housing in history are\nbeing cultural. And we are. But so is he.\n\nThe numbers pencil out the same if you increase housing supply, decrease\nsingle adult households, or whatever else.\n\nWhy exactly should society care less about person A's desire for low housing\nthan person B's desire for single adult householding? Why should ever lower\nsub-2 person housing be the goal of policy?\n\nI mean we know that living alone is correlated with higher health costs and\neven more correlated with high health costs charged to the public purse. We\nknow that living alone increases demands on roads, sewers, and other public\nservices. We know that the carbon expenditures go up from living alone. And we\nknow that lower adult occupancy houses tend to be owned by wealthier folks.\n\nMaybe I am weird, but that seems like a bad thing to design policy to\nmaximize. If anything, a market neutral approach would be to tax homes more\nwith lower occupancy. And we already do this to some degree living separately\ndoes generate higher sewer fees per person if they are not bundled into the\ntaxes, but just flat taxing low occupancy would capture externalities that are\nharder to capture (e.g. amenity degradation).\n\nAs far as the public purse is considered, 2 is likely the cheapest number for\nhousing adults in houses. Maybe it would be unfair or immoral to charge the\ndivorced, the widowed, or the autistic more ... but those are cultural\narguments.\n\nEnd of the day, YIMBYism allows no other solutions to building because they\nvalue their morality more than yours. Increasing the taxes on unoccupied homes\nis a moral affront them so it is off the table; giving a 10 or 20% haircut to\nthe primary retirement vehicle of the middle class by destroying the views is\nan acceptable use of government preemption. And, of course, actually just\nusing markets to buy out the NIMBYs never seems to be an option. Somehow, we\nhave trillion dollar bills on the ground but nobody, anywhere, on either side\nof the law, or in any demographic mix ever finds a way to reach a basic\nCoasean bargain.\n\nRespond\n\n### Nice One\n\n2024-04-19 07:55:51\n\n16| 16  \n---|---  \n  \nHide Replies\n\n#\n\nYou just proved Alex's point.

But that's not the fundamental flaw. Too many people want to live where\nthey can't afford it because 'some people enjoy having what they don't deserve\nand then crow about it to their peers' - millennials and younger,\nspecifically. The people pushing for affordable housing in the big cities (not\nso much suburbs unless the schools are exemplary) are doing it as a status\nsignalling move. The problem at the end of the day, is that it is far more\nexpensive, for what you get, to live, support, and long-term sustain a city\n-and- that the city has every obligation to demand that of its inhabitants. It\nwould be interesting to model the actual costs of all the city's amenities and\nits long-term capital maintenance, as if it was an isolated entity, not the\neconomic engine of a region - which is separate. And then of course, on top is\nthe 'value' of the land both due to proximity and density.

I don't know where the statistics\nwould wall.\n\nI would say it almost doesn't even matter why they want to cluster in\nexpensive cities. If its a broad population issue, its more of a matter of\nhuman nature than diagnosing an individual's choices (for the purpose of\neconomic policy). I prefer to live in the world of what is than what should\nbe. If they all want to go to the city, and we don't seem to have any way of\nchanging their minds, then we need to think about solutions to solve the\nproblems where they are.\n\nAlso, if we're talking about non-technical degree and non-trade people, we're\nprimarily talking about the service industry.

All else equal, more children\nper two adults would mean the same number of homes required, albeit with more\nsquare footage (*more* children leading to *higher* prices which is the\nopposite of the argument made). Children don't normally buy homes, in my\nexperience. It could be that Alex meant simply that more adults are living\nalone; however, this isn't the same as having fewer kids and was not the\nargument presented. Besides, a quick check of the fertility statistics\nsuggests that while the rate has been declining modestly for the last ten\nyears, at 1.66 it is where it was in 1984.\n\nAs usual, the likely correct explanation is not \"the\", much less \"the real\nexplanation\", but that there are a number of factors leading to the housing\nmarket situation the US faces today.

Thus in places that are popular vacation\ndestinations (where I once had a home), a cause of the high home prices is\nmostly the result of investors buying at inflated prices (inflated because the\nhouses are valued based on the expected cash flow from short term rentals).\nThis also affects long-term rental rates by creating a shortage of long-term\nrentals. In a popular vacation destination, with all the restaurants, shops,\netc., there is a high demand for labor that provides the services, labor that\ncannot afford the inflated rents for long-term rentals. In places such as\nCharleston, it's near crisis, as popular restaurants and hotels are losing\nfavor with tourists because the restaurants and hotels cannot recruit the\nemployees needed to operate the restaurants and hotels: the employees have to\nfind housing far from the restaurants and hotels.

You don't seem to me to really answer this reply with\na moral argument why we should use the term shortage for housing.\n\nUltimately, look, in the US, homelessness per adult fell during this period of\nvery slightly per adult tightening supply from 2008-2022 , with a very slight\nincrease in 2023.\n\nI think we are on safer group attributing that increase to the general\ninflation pressures of 2022-23 and not housing.\n\nYou're asking people with often very large housing debt to absorb a large\nhouse price correction, ostensibly to help the homeless.\n\nBut for the majority of people, it will cheaper for them to pay via additional\ntaxes to help shelter the homeless, compared to the wealth cut they'd eat from\na house price correction.\n\nSo I think helping the unsheltered homeless who are rough sleeping is a fig-\nleaf here.\n\nThe only people truly better off from a large house price correction - the\nones who'd be making out like bandits from impoverishing home owners - are\nearly career Yuppies who don't yet own any housing.\n\nRespond\n\nContinue this thread \u2192\n\n### Sure\n\n2024-04-19 15:55:15\n\n0| 0  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nEhh, the golden hammer unlocks the iron door.\n\nI mean we literally had to deal with this exact scenario to build a hospital.\nWe could have pissed and moaned about the neighbors were being unreasonable,\nlobbied the state to preempt local zoning (where the neighbors could easily\nsway elections), and maybe eventually got to the point where they sue us\nrepeatedly ...\n\nor we could just bribe them first. Which is what we did. We spent cold hard\ncash on playgrounds, road improvements, and the rest.\n\nEnd of the day, the neighbors are not crazed Luddites.

You can then choose\nto pick a fight (activating loss aversion, tribalism, and questions of honor).\nOr you can buy them out.\n\nIf they are too expensive to buy out. Then maybe your development does not\nhave that much value in the real-world market.\n\nI can buy that some coordination mechanism can lead to an inability to buy\nfolks out sometimes ... but I just don't see real world market rates that ever\nlook as rosy as YIMBY projections. Vernon, CA was corrupt and had pay-to-play\nzoning. It was a few miles from downtown LA. And nobody ever offered them a\nbillion bucks buy unlimited zoning. There are dozens of tiny burgs adjacent to\nmajor high cost metros. Nobody ever goes to Great Falls or Potomac and buys\nthe whole town lock, stock, and barrel to build large scale developments.\nEither the folks in Potomac really value their exclusive, low density\nneighborhood ... or the developments just are not worth that much.\n\nAll the major developments I have read about suggest exceptionally high\nreservation prices and the fact that the literal mob never even bothered\nfixing a zoning election or two so they could then make a few billion\nlegitimately seems quite odd.\n\nYIMBY keeps telling us that the sky is the limit, that NIMBYs don't actually\nvalue things that highly, etc. And then turn around have zero examples, ever,\nof where a third of their projected profits ever changed hands on the black,\nwhite, or grey markets.\n\nRespond\n\n### Anti-Gnostic\n\n2024-04-19 17:10:04\n\n0| 0  \n---|---  \n  \n#\n\nHow many of those people are viable tenants?\n\nZillow for metro Phoenix shows 3,249 listings for rent up to $2,000/month and\n1,460 listings for sale up to $200,000.

One\nexample of the wealthy using more resources than before is that it is more\ncommon now for a divorced couple to have one home for the kids where the\nfather or mother spend a week and then move back to their own place rather\nthan make the kids move back and forth between homes. So, what used to be one\nhousehold is now taking up three homes. I actually think upper middle class\nfamilies can simply afford these luxuries and with limited supply it is\ndriving up the cost of housing.
