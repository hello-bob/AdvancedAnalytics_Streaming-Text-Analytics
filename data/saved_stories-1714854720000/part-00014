According to recruitment agency Hays, over half of people\nhave had a negative experience during the interview process for a new job.\n\nThe BBC has heard stories from dozens of people who went through odd,\noffensive, and off-putting interviews.\n\nThey got in touch following the news that John Lewis is changing its\nrecruitment process by allowing applicants to see interview questions in\nadvance, in an attempt to make the process fairer.\n\nSo what can bad interviews teach us? And what can interviewees and\ninterviewers do to make the experience less questionable?\n\nAixin Fu\n\nAixin Fu says she felt peer pressure to take part in an unusual task during a\ngroup interview\n\nLike Lae, Aixin Fu also had a bizarre experience. She applied for a student\nambassador job for minimum wage at a university.\n\nDuring a group interview, everyone was asked to crawl around on their hands\nand knees and \u201cmoo like a cow\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe did that for about three to four minutes,\u201d she recalls.\n\n\"At the time, I was quite annoyed. It was highly inappropriate.\n\n\"But there was a bit of peer pressure because everyone else was doing it.\"\n\nThe interviewer said they were trying to see if the candidates were \"fun\",\nthough Ms Fu suspects that \"maybe someone just had a bit of a power trip\".\n\n## \u2018So how many years do you think you've got left?\u2019\n\nJulie from Missouri in the US says she learnt that interviewers can sometimes\nbe \u201creally isolated\u201d from what it\u2019s like to be an interviewee.\n\nThis was her takeaway from a video interview she did in 2022 to be a part-time\ncopywriter.\n\nAt first, she felt it was going well. \u201cI was ticking all the boxes,\u201d she says.\n\nBut towards the end, the interviewer asked: \u201cSo how many years do you think\nyou've got left in you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in my early 60s,\u201d Julie says. \u201cI\u2019m not going to retire for quite a\nwhile.\u201d\n\n## John Lewis job applicants get questions beforehand\n\n## Interview questions hold autistic jobseekers back - report\n\n## 'My interviewer thought I was too old for the job'\n\nAgeism is not the only prejudice people may experience during interviews.\n\nPearl Kasirye, a content marketing manager, says she was asked about her\nheritage during a second interview for a partially remote PR role at a fashion\nbrand in Milan.\n\nMs Kasirye lives in London and left Uganda to live and study in Europe as a\nchild.\n\nShe says the employer was insistent on paying her a Ugandan wage rather than a\nLondon wage for the remote work because of her background.\n\nShe chose to withdraw her application.\n\n\u201cWhere you\u2019re from, you have no control over,\u201d she says, adding that she has\ninterviewed people herself since and is \u201cso much more mindful\u201d about her\nquestions.\n\nPearl Kasirye\n\nPearl Kasirye, who lives in London, was asked to accept a Ugandan wage\n\nSometimes prejudice can be accidental \u2014 or at least less explicit \u2014 but still\njust as difficult for the interviewee.\n\nTom (not his real name) is an IT engineer who was once asked to film answers\nto questions for a warehouse assistant job, rather than talking to someone in\na formal interview.\n\nTom describes himself as on the autistic spectrum, though it is not something\nhe likes to share with people.\n\nHe says he needs clear instructions during an interview process and much\nprefers talking face-to-face, describing the filming process as \u201cdetached -\nlike you\u2019re talking to a computer\".\n\n## 'Do you have children?'\n\nMany people also told the BBC they had been discriminated against during\nhiring based on their gender.\n\nAccording to data from hiring platform Applied, nearly one in five women have\nbeen asked whether they have children, or plan to have children, during hiring\nprocesses.\n\nOne of those is Applied\u2019s chief executive Khyati Sundaram, who says she has\nbeen asked \u201cmore times than I can count\u201d.\n\nIt is illegal for employers to ask candidates about their marital status,\nwhether they have children, or whether they plan to have children.\n\nDespite this, Applied found the problem is even worse for women applying for\nsenior roles, where two-fifths of women had been asked the same question.\n\nMs Sundaram says one of the reasons for this is the perceived \u201ceconomic\nlability\u201d of pregnancy. \u201cThe higher the pay, the more maternity you have to\npay while finding a cover, and they don\u2019t want the hassle.\"\n\nApplied\n\nKhyati Sundaram is the chief executive of hiring platform Applied\n\nSometimes the hiring process is bad not because of prejudice but because, as\nMs Sundaram puts it: \u201cThere is no benchmark for what good looks like on the\ninterviewer side.\"\n\nHer top tips for interviewers are to ask the same questions to every candidate\nand to design those questions with \u201cmarginalised groups\u201d in mind.\n\nAs for Aixin Fu, she says her experience taught her to assert herself more in\nfuture interviews, especially if asked to do something \u201cbizarre, unreasonable,\nor not a requirement for the job\u201d \u2014 such as moo like a cow.\n\n## Let us know you agree to cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best online experience.\n\nPlease let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.\n\n  * No, take me to settings\n\n", "frontpage": true}
