The anecdote is equal parts\namusing and concerning: What has modern life come to if shopping for dishes\nmust be scheduled in the same way that work meetings are? Today\u2019s newsletter\nexplores the many different meanings of \u201cI\u2019m so busy,\u201d and what we miss when\nour focus is on being busy above all else.\n\nOn Being Busy\n\nHow to Be Less Busy and More Happy\n\nBy Arthur C.
