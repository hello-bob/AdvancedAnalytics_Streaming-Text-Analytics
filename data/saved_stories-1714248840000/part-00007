They showed that it predicted development of the disease, as\nwell as its progression, which was demonstrated in their earlier work.\n\nThe research advances the utility of a blood test that would be superior to\ncurrent diagnostic tools that often don't identify the disease until it has\ncaused structural damage to the joint.\n\n\"Currently, you've got to have an abnormal X-ray to show clear evidence of\nknee osteoarthritis, and by the time it shows up on X-ray, your disease has\nbeen progressing for some time,\" said senior author Virginia Byers Kraus,\nM.D., Ph.D., a professor in the departments of Medicine, Pathology, and\nOrthopedic Surgery at Duke University School of Medicine.\n\n\"What our blood test demonstrates is that it's possible to detect this disease\nmuch earlier than our current diagnostics permit.\"\n\nOsteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis, afflicting an\nestimated 35 million adults in the U.S. and causing significant economic and\nsocietal impacts. While there are currently no cures, the success of potential\nnew therapies could hinge on identifying the disease early and slowing its\nprogression before it becomes debilitating.\n\nKraus and colleagues have focused on developing molecular biomarkers that can\nbe used for both clinical diagnostic purposes and as a research tool to aid in\nthe development of effective drugs. In previous studies, the blood biomarker\ntest demonstrated 74% accuracy in predicting knee OA progression and 85%\naccuracy in diagnosing knee OA.\n\nThe current study further honed the test's predictive capabilities. Using a\nlarge United Kingdom database, the researchers analyzed serum of 200 white\nwomen, half diagnosed with OA and the other half without the disease, matched\nby body mass index and age.\n\nThey found that a small number of biomarkers in the blood test successfully\ndistinguished the women with knee OA from those without it, catching molecular\nsignals of OA eight years before many of the women were diagnosed with the\ndisease by X-ray.\n\n\"This is important because it provides more evidence that there are\nabnormalities in the joint that can be detected by blood biomarkers well\nbefore X-rays can detect OA,\" Kraus said. \"Early-stage osteoarthritis could\nprovide a 'window of opportunity' in which to arrest the disease process and\nrestore joint health.\"\n\nMore information: Virginia Kraus, An Osteoarthritis Pathophysiological\nContinuum Revealed by Molecular Biomarkers, Science Advances (2024).
