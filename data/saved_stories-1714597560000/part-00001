The company didn\u2019t notify the nearly 150,000\nresidents of Stickney, Cicero and Berwyn, nor any representative of a news\norganization, major community organization or state legislator\u2019s office.\nReporters at the Independiente and MuckRock only uncovered the meeting\u2019s\nexistence by appealing a denial of a Freedom of Information Act request for\nemails and correspondence among local officials.\n\nThe request was originally denied by the Village of Stickney, citing an\nexemption from the Illinois Freedom of Information Act that the request would\nbe \u201cunduly burdensome.\u201d In Illinois, there are over 25 categories of\nexemptions, which are highly detailed and expansive.\n\nMuckRock\u2019s Data Reporter Dillon Bergin appealed this request by referring back\nto key parts of the exemption the Village of Stickney cited that demonstrated\nhow the village actually hadn\u2019t followed the law before rejecting the request.\nThe exemption clarifies that before a request can be deemed \u2018unduly\nburdensome,\u2019 the agency must first reach out to the requester to discuss ways\nto narrow the request beforehand.\n\nIn his appeal, Bergin explained to the Illinois Attorney General\u2019s Public\nAccess Counselor how he had asked the village for estimates on the number of\nresponsive records and how the request could be narrowed, but the village\ndeclined to work with him further.\n\nThe success of this appeal led to the unmasking of the company\u2019s secret\nmeeting, which was described in emails between the Village of Stickney and the\npublic relations firm.\n\n## Get help overcoming your own rejections\n\nRequesters may face a similar denial of their public records requests, but\nthere are ways to appeal.
