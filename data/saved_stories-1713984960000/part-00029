Introduction\n\nI first encountered the question of race and intelligence sixty-eight years\nago. This was in 1951 when I was a student reading psychology at Cambridge and\nattended Alice Heim\u2019s lectures on intelligence. She told us that Blacks in the\nUnited States had a lower IQ than Whites and this was attributable to\ndiscrimination, which she subsequently asserted in her book (Heim, 1954) [1].\nShe also told us of the UNESCO (1951) [2] statement that \u201cAvailable scientific\nknowledge provides no basis for believing that the groups of mankind differ in\ntheir innate capacity for intellectual and emotional development.\u201d She did not\ntell us that this assertion was disputed by Sir Ronald Fisher (1951) [3], the\nProfessor of Genetics at Cambridge, who wrote a dissent stating that evidence\nand everyday experience showed that human groups differ profoundly \u201cin their\ninnate capacity for intellectual and emotional development\u201d and that \u201cthis\nproblem is being obscured by entirely well-intentioned efforts to minimize the\nreal differences that exist.\u201d\n\nNor did Alice Heim tell us that Henry Garrett, the Professor of Psychology at\nColumbia University, had argued that genetic factors are largely responsible\nfor the lower IQ of Blacks than of Whites (Garrett, 1945) [4] so I and my\nfellow students at Cambridge were not well-informed about the issue of race\ndifferences in intelligence and its causes. Alice Heim was giving us the\nmainstream position among social scientists in the 1950s and this remained\nlargely unchallenged in the 1960s. I believe the only person who challenged it\nwas Henry Garrett (1961) [5], who designated it \u201cthe equalitarian dogma\u201d, but\nI did not know of him until much later. At this time I did not question the\nmainstream position among social scientists that Blacks and Whites have equal\nability as my interest during these years was in personality and I was not\nthinking about intelligence.\n\nIt was in 1967 that I became interested in this issue. This came about when I\nmoved to Ireland to take up a position as research professor at the Economic\nand Social Research Institute (ESIR) in Dublin. The purpose of the ESIR was to\ncarry out research on the economic and social problems of Ireland and find\npolicies that would help solve them. Foremost among these was that, at that\ntime, Ireland was quite economically backward compared with Britain and I\nresearched the literature to see what contribution I could make to this\nproblem. It was not long before I discovered a study by John Macnamara (1966)\n[6] that reported that the IQ of Irish 12 year olds was 90, compared with 100\nin Britain. It appeared that the low IQ was likely a significant cause of the\nIrish economic backwardness. I knew that intelligence was a determinant of\nearnings among individuals and that this was also true for groups. I knew of\nCyril Burt\u2019s (1937) [7] book The Backward Child, in which he showed that\nchildren in the boroughs of London had different IQs and that these were\nhighly correlated across the boroughs with the earnings of adults. I knew that\nthis had also been shown by Maller (1933) [8] in the boroughs of New York\ncity. It seemed likely that the same would hold for nations and, in\nparticular, for the economic backwardness of Ireland. This was how I came to\nformulate the theory that differences in intelligence are an important\ndeterminant of national per capita incomes that I was to publish later, in\ncollaboration with Tatu Vanhanen, in IQ and the Wealth of Nations (Lynn and\nVanhanen, 2002) [9].\n\nAs I thought about this in 1968, I decided it would be wise to check\nMacnamara\u2019s study reporting the low Irish IQ. I asked two of my assistants,\nIan Hart and Bernadette O\u2019Sullivan, to carry out a further study and they did\nthis by administering Cattell\u2019s Culture Fair test to a sample in Dublin. They\nfound their sample had an IQ of 88 compared with 100 in Britain (Hart and\nO\u2019Sullivan, 1970) [10] and therefore closely similar to the IQ of 90 that\nMacnamara had reported.\n\nAlthough this confirmed Macnamara\u2019s study, it was a disconcerting result. I\nwondered whether it would be wise to publish my conclusion that the low IQ was\na significant factor responsible for the economic backwardness of Ireland. I\ndoubted whether this conclusion would be well received, particularly coming\nfrom an Englishman telling the Irish that they had a low IQ problem.\nFurthermore, it would raise the question of what policies could be adopted to\nsolve the problem. These would be a set of eugenic policies that would raise\nthe Irish IQ, such as the sterilization of the mentally retarded and\nincentives for graduates to have more children. Eugenic policies of this kind\nhad been regarded as sensible by most informed people in the first half of the\ntwentieth century but in the late 1960s they had begun to be repudiated. In\nmany countries, eugenics societies closed themselves down or changed their\nnames and that of their journals. In 1968, the British Eugenics Society ended\nthe publication of its journal The Eugenics Review and replaced it with\nJournal of Biosocial Science and in 1969 the American Eugenics Society ended\nthe publication of its journal Eugenics Quarterly and replaced it with Social\nBiology. Neither of these new journals published papers on eugenics. In\naddition, although eugenics societies had been founded in virtually all\neconomically developed countries in the first half of the twentieth century,\nIreland was an exception. Ireland at that time was a deeply Catholic country\nand the Catholics had been the only group, articulated by G. K. Chesterton,\nthat had opposed eugenics in the first half of the twentieth century. By 1970,\neugenics had become almost universally rejected. Virtually no-one supported\neugenic programs anymore and anyone who proposed doing so would be accused of\nbeing a Nazi. For all these reasons, I did not think I could publish the low\nIrish IQ while I was in Dublin and I decided that, in order to do so, I would\nhave to move.\n\nIn 1969, the consensus that there are no race differences in intelligence was\nchallenged by Art Jensen in his paper How much can we boost IQ and scholastic\nachievement? [11] In this he argued that the 15 IQ point difference between\nBlacks and Whites in the United States was likely to have some genetic basis.\nTo quote his words, \u201cit is not an unreasonable hypothesis that genetic factors\nare implicated in the average Negro\u2013White intelligence difference\u201d. This paper\ngenerated a storm of protest. I read Jensen\u2019s paper and concluded that he was\nright. I discussed it with Hans Eysenck who said he agreed and in 1971 [12],\nhe published his book Race, Intelligence and Education, in which he summarised\nthe evidence for this. About the same time, William Shockley began lecturing\nand publishing papers arguing that the Black IQ deficit is largely genetic\n(Shockley, 1971) [13] and this also generated a lot of publicity on account of\nhis being a Nobel prize-winner for the invention of the transistor.\n\n## 2\\. Attacks from Equalitarians\n\nJensen and Eysenck were subjected to many attacks from Equalitarians for\nexpressing these views. Students at Jensen\u2019s University of California at\nBerkeley held protests and demanded that he be fired. His car tires were\nslashed and the university police provided bodyguards to protect him. He\nreceived threats, was spat on and was prevented from delivering lectures. I\nwitnessed this hostility in the summer of 1971 at a conference in Li\u00e8ge at\nwhich Jensen was scheduled to give a lecture on race differences in\nintelligence. As he was about to speak, there were shouts of Zeig Heil! from\nthe audience, but after some pleas from the chairman the shouts died down and\nJensen was able to deliver his lecture. As I had read Jensen\u2019s work I did not\nlearn anything new, except for the Zeig Heil! shouts that race differences\nexcite a huge hostile emotional reaction in many people. After his lecture, I\nmet up with Art and we had dinner together. He told me that in the late 1960s\nhe began looking at the evidence on the Black\u2013White difference in intelligence\non the assumption that this was solely environmentally determined, but the\nmore he considered the data, the more evident it became that genetic factors\nare also involved. In 1973 Hans Eysenck encountered similar hostility when he\nbegan to deliver a lecture at the London School of Economics. As soon as he\nstarted, a number of students went up and attacked him and broke his glasses.\n\nAn opportunity to move from Dublin came in 1971 when the University of Ulster\nadvertised for the professorship of psychology. I applied, was offered the\nposition and accepted, and moved to Ulster in 1972. I believed I would now be\nable to publish my conclusions on the low Irish IQ. I would also be able to\nwork more generally on the relation of intelligence to national incomes and to\nthe related issue of the relation of intelligence to regional differences in\nincomes within countries. I realised that this work would likely be met with\nthe same hostility that Jensen and Eysenck had encountered and it was\ntherefore important to research the evidence thoroughly and ensure it was\nsound before going public.\n\nIn the 1970s, Japan and Singapore were achieving rapid economic growth and I\nresearched the issue of their IQs to examine the possibility that they might\nhave high IQs that contributed to their economic development. I discovered\nthat this was the case and in 1977, I published papers showing that the IQ in\nJapan was 106.6 and that the IQ in Singapore was 107 in relation to a British\nIQ of 100 (Lynn, 1977a, 1977b) [14,15].\n\nThe next year I published the first survey of national and racial differences\nin intelligence worldwide (Lynn, 1978) [16]. In this, I set the British IQ at\n100 with a standard deviation of 15 and showed that the European peoples,\nincluding those in the United States, Australia and New Zealand, have same IQ,\nexcept for southern Europe, where the IQ was somewhat lower, falling to 89 in\nGreece. I gave the IQ in Iraq, Iran, India and sub-Saharan Africa as in the\nmid to low 80s; the IQ of Northeast Asians in Japan and Singapore as\napproximately 107; the IQ of Southeast Asians represented by Indonesia as 96;\nthe IQ of Native American Indians as in the low 90s; the IQ of New Zealand\nMaori as approximately 94; the IQ of Micronesians and Polynesians as\napproximately 88; the IQ of Australian Aborigines as about 80; and the IQ of\nKalahari Bushmen as approximately 55. These national and racial IQs have been\nlargely confirmed by the numerous studies that have been published during the\nsubsequent forty years that I have summarised in Lynn (2015) [17] and have\nbeen confirmed independently by David Becker in Lynn and Becker (2019) [18].\nThe only substantial differences are that the more recent data show the IQ of\nsub-Saharan Africans is approximately 70 and the IQ of Australian Aborigines\nis 62.\n\nIn 1982 I published a further paper on the IQ in Japan showing that this had\nincreased during recent decades and proposing that improvements in nutrition\nhave been largely responsible for this increase [19]. This prompted Jim Flynn\nto see whether the IQ had increased in the United States and two years later\nhe reported that it had (Flynn, 1984) [20]. This inspired Dick Herrnstein and\nCharles Murray (1994) [21] in their book The Bell Curve to designate increases\nin intelligence the \u201cFlynn effect\u201d. As I had shown the increase two years\nearlier, several people redesignated it the Lynn\u2013Flynn effect or the LFlynn\neffect (Rindermann, 2018) [22]. Neither of these designations was appropriate,\nbecause about twenty people had previously reported increases in intelligence\nduring the previous half century in studies that I have summarised in Lynn\n(2013) [23].\n\nIn the 1970s, I also looked at regional differences in intelligence within\ncountries and their economic and social outcomes and in 1979\u20131981, I published\nthree papers on these. The first gave IQs for the regions of the British Isles\nshowing that the average IQ is highest in London and Southeast England and\ndeclines successively in the English provinces, Scotland and Northern Ireland\nand is lowest in the Republic of Ireland and that these IQs are highly\ncorrelated with per capita incomes and a number of other socio-economic\nphenomena, including infant mortality and intellectual achievements (Lynn,\n1979) [24]. In this paper I was able to give further studies showing that the\nIQ in the Republic of Ireland is significantly lower than that in Britain and\nI attributed this to selective migration of the more intelligent from Ireland\nto Britain, the United States and elsewhere. Some forty years later, these\nregional IQ differences were confirmed for the United Kingdom (excluding the\nIrish Republic) by Noah Carl (2016) [25]. The next year I published a paper\ngiving IQs for 79 regions of France showing that the average IQ is highest in\nParis and that the regional IQs are highly correlated with per capita incomes,\ninfant mortality and intellectual achievements (Lynn, 1980) [26]. A year later\nI published similar data for Spain (Lynn, 1981) [27].\n\nDuring the 1980s I collected more data on race differences in intelligence and\nalso carried out some studies on race differences in reaction times. I\npublished these in Lynn (1991a) [28]. This gave the IQ of Europeans as 100,\nexcept in the south where it declines to the mid-90s; 106 for Northeast\nAsians; 92 for New Zealand Maori; 86 for Native American Indians; 86 for South\nAsians represented by India; 70 for sub-Saharan Africans; and 79 for\nAustralian Aborigines. Subsequent studies have shown that these IQs are about\nright except for Australian Aborigines for whom the IQ is now estimated as 62\n(Lynn, 2015) [17] The studies of race differences in reaction times were\ncarried out on 9 year olds and showed that these were fastest among the\nChinese in Hong Kong and successively slower in the Japanese, British, Irish\nand Blacks in South Africa. Thus, these reaction time differences were highly\ncorrelated with the intelligence differences in these five populations.\n\nLater in the same year I published a paper on how these race differences could\nhave evolved and proposed the cold winters theory, stating that higher\nintelligence was selected for in the colder environments of Europe and\nNortheast Asia during the last ice age and was the principal factor\nresponsible for the evolution of greater intelligence in the European and\nNortheast Asian peoples (Lynn, 1991b) [29]. This theory has now become widely\naccepted, e.g., by Miller (1991) [30], Rushton (1995) [31] and Rinderman\n(2018) [22]. I believe the only dissent has come from Flynn (this issue) who\nargues that the high intelligence of the southern Chinese cannot be explained\nby cold winters because they were south of the Himalayas during the last ice\nage and were not exposed to its cold winters and only subsequently migrated\ninto southern China. He does not offer any evidence for this speculation and\nit has been refuted by Frost (this issue).\n\nIn the 1990s, I collected more data on race differences in intelligence and\nalso published books on dysgenics, i.e., the decline of genotypic intelligence\nfrom the late nineteenth century resulting principally from the low fertility\nof higher IQ women (Lynn, 1996) [32] and a sequel on eugenics setting out\npolicies for reversing the dysgenic decline (Lynn, 2001) [33].\n\nIn 2000, I returned to the issue of national differences in intelligence and\ntheir contribution to economic development. I worked on this with Tatu\nVanhanen, a political scientist in Finland, and we published our conclusions\nin our book IQ and the Wealth of Nations (Lynn and Vanhanen, 2002) [9]. In\nthis I gave IQs for all major 185 nations in the world and Tatu Vanhanen gave\nthe per capita income measured as real GDP (gross domestic product). We showed\nthat national IQs were significantly correlated at 0.62 with per capita income\nand therefore that national IQs explained 38 percent of the variance in\nnational per capita income (0.62 squared = 0.38).\n\nWe were not wholly surprised that this claim received a mixed reception. Among\nour negative critics were Earl Hunt and Robert Sternberg (2006) [34] who\ndescribed them as \u201ctechnically inadequate... and meaningless\u201d. Others were\nsupportive, including Erich Weede and Sebastian Kampf (2002) [35] who wrote\nthat \u201cthere is one clear and robust result: Average IQ does promote growth\u201d\nand Edward Miller (2002) [36] wrote that \u201cthe theory helps significantly to\nexplain why some countries are rich and some poor\u201d.\n\nIn 2006 Tatu Vanhanen and I published a further study of national IQs and\neconomic development in our book IQ and Global Inequality [37] and in 2012, we\npublished a third study in our book Intelligence: A Unifying Construct for the\nSocial Sciences. In this we confirmed that national IQs are significantly\ncorrelated with per capita income and showed that national IQs are\nsignificantly correlated with a number of other phenomena, including\npositively with income inequality assessed by the Gini index (0.47), number of\nresearchers in research and development (0.67), life satisfaction (0.63), life\nexpectancy (0.76), quality of water (0.62) and quality of sanitation (0.71);\nand negatively with the rate of unemployment (\u22120.76), gender inequality\n(\u22120.86), corruption (\u22120.59), religious belief (\u22120.48), malnutrition (\u22120.52)\nand tuberculosis (\u22120.57),\n\nThese additional correlates validated our national IQs and a number of\nscholars came to accept the validity of these and their contribution to a wide\nrange of economic and social phenomena. Matrin Voracek (2013) [38] wrote that\n\u201cThe publication of a compilation of national intelligence (IQ) estimates for\nthe world\u2019s countries by Lynn and Vanhanen has spawned considerable interest\namong researchers across a variety of scientific disciplines...Up to now,\nacross dozens of studies, theoretically expected and thus meaningful\naggregate-level associations of national IQ with numerous other psychological,\nsocioeconomic, and demographic indicators have been obtained.\u201d The validity of\nour national IQs was also endorsed by Sergey Kulivets and Dmitri Ushakov\n(2016) [39] of the Russian Academy of Sciences. They wrote: \u201cWe propose that\nproblem solving is the mediator between human competencies and achievements.\nCreation of goods and services is based on problem solving in design,\nproduction and delivery...The simulation reproduces the most important traits\nof Lynn and Vanhanen\u2019s (2002) [9] findings.\u201d Even Earl Hunt, who initially\nrejected our national IQs as meaningless, conceded that \u201cin spite of the\nweaknesses in several of their data points Lynn and Vanhanen\u2019s empirical\nconclusion was correct\u201d (Hunt and Wittmann, 2008) [40].\n\nAt the same time that I was working with Tatu Vanhanen on national IQ, I\ncontinued to work on the related issue of racial IQs. In 2006 I published Race\nDifferences in Intelligence: An Evolutionary Analysis. I followed this with a\nsecond updated edition in 2015. This summarised the results of several hundred\nstudies and the second gave the following IQs: Northeast Asians: 105;\nEuropeans in Northern, Central and Western Europe, North America, Australia\nand New Zealand: 100; Eastern Europeans: 97; Southern Europeans: 92\u201396; Arctic\npeoples: 91; Maori: 90; Hispanics (US) 89; Native Americans: 86; Pacific\nIslanders: 85; South Asians: 84; North Africans: 83; sub-Saharan Africa: 71;\nAustralian Aborigines: 62; Pygmies: 57; Bushmen: 55. These IQs have been\ngenerally confirmed by Heiner Rindermann (2018) [22] in his book Cognitive\nCapitalism: Human Capital and the Wellbeing of Nations, in which he gives\nupdated national IQs, which he prefers to call cognitive abilities (CAs), for\nall 200 nations of any significant size in the world calculated from tests of\nintelligence and educational attainment in the PISA (Programme for\nInternational Student Assessment), TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics\nand Science Study) and similar studies. He gives a correlation of 0.82 for 161\ncountries between national cognitive abilities and per capita income assessed\nas logged GDP in 2010, showing that two thirds of the variance in national per\ncapita income can be explained by the cognitive abilities of the populations.\nThis correlation is a little higher than those we reported in 2002 at 0.62 for\n185 countries for GDP per capita and in 2012 at 0.71 for 192 countries.\n\nDuring these years I wrote two more papers on regional differences in\nintelligence and their economic and social correlates in countries. The first\nof these was for Italy, which reported the highest IQ in the north and\ndeclining IQs in the south and that these predicted differences in income,\neducation attainment and infant mortality (Lynn, 2010, 2011) [41,42]. I\nattributed the lower IQs in the south to the immigrants with lower IQs from\nNorth Africa and the Near East. The second was for Spain and reported\nsimilarly the highest IQ in the north and associated economic and social\ncorrelates and likewise attributed the lower IQs in the south to the\nimmigrants with lower IQs from North Africa and the Near East (Lynn, 2012)\n[43].\n\nTatu Vanhanen died in 20I5 and I recruited David Becker to work with me on a\nfurther update of national IQs and their correlates. We published these in\n2019. David Becker wrote the chapter giving the updated national IQs and\nshowed that these range between of 69 in sub-Saharan Africa and 105 in\nNortheast Asia and are therefore closely similar to those of 67 in sub-Saharan\nAfrica and 105 in Northeast Asia given in our 2012 compilation; for the whole\ndataset, his updated national IQs were correlated at 0.87 with those we gave\nin Lynn and Vanhanen (2012) [44]. I wrote the chapter summarising the several\nhundred studies of the causes, correlates and consequences of national IQs.\nThis documented that national IQs are significantly causal to educational\nattainment, per capita income, economic growth, income inequality, cognitive\nachievements, political institutions (e.g., democracy, market economy),\nhappiness, religion, health, nutrition, crime and fertility and significantly\nthe result of differences in race and ethnicity, morphology and physiology\n(e.g., brain size), geographical location (latitude) and genetics. I also\nwrote the final chapter on the future of national IQs. I argued that the\ndifference between high and low IQ nations will decline as IQs in low IQ\nnations will increase, while those in European nations will decline as a\nresult of dysgenic fertility and immigration. I concluded intelligence will\ncontinue to increase in Northeast Asia and that China is likely to emerge as\nthe world\u2019s superpower in the second half of the twenty-first century.\n\nI was surprised in 2017 to get an invitation from Robert Sternberg to\ncontribute a chapter on my national IQs to a book he was editing on\nintelligence. He wrote that he was inviting the nineteen most cited\npsychologists on intelligence to contribute chapters on their work and that,\nas I was one of these, he was extending the invitation to me. I accepted and\nsent him The Intelligence of Nations, which he duly included (probably\nreluctantly) in the book. Thus, in the twelve years from 2002 to 2018, my\nnational IQs had evolved from \u201ctechnically inadequate... and meaningless\u201d\n(Hunt and Sternberg, 2006) [34] to mainstream acceptance published by the\nCambridge University Press (Sternberg, 2018).\n\n## 3\\. More Attacks from Equalitarians\n\nThe attacks in 1969\u20131973 by Equalitarians on Art Jensen and Hans Eysenck\ncontinued throughout the subsequent years on pretty much all of us who wrote\ncontending that there are racial and national differences in intelligence. In\nthe United States, it is virtually impossible to fire academics with tenure at\nuniversities, but others have been fired and attacked in other ways. Some of\nthe notable instances are the attack on James Watson in 2007 after he gave an\ninterview in which he had said that he was \u201cinherently gloomy about the\nprospect of Africa because all our social policies are based on the fact that\ntheir intelligence is the same as ours whereas all the testing says not\nreally\u201d. This observation created a great furore. Watson was in Britain at the\ntime to give lectures at the Science Museum in London and at the universities\nof Oxford, Cambridge, Birmingham, Bristol and Edinburgh. His lecture at the\nScience Museum was instantly cancelled. A spokesperson for the museum\nexplained that \u201cWe feel Dr. Watson has gone beyond the point of acceptable\ndebate and we are, as a result, cancelling his talk.\u201d The universities of\nBirmingham and Edinburgh also cancelled his lectures. The Board of Trustees of\nthe Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Long Island where Watson was chancellor\nissued a statement that it \u201cvehemently\u201d disagreed with Watson\u2019s comments,\nsuspended him from his position and demanded that he resign or he would be\nfired. Watson opted to resign to avoid being dismissed. In January, 2019,\nWatson participated in a TV documentary in which he said that his views on\nrace and intelligence had not changed. He said \u201cThere\u2019s a difference on the\naverage between Blacks and Whites on IQ tests,\u201d and \u201cI would say the\ndifference is...genetic.\u201d The next day, the Board of Trustees of the Cold\nSpring Harbor Laboratory stated that \u201cDr. Watson\u2019s statements are\nreprehensible, unsupported by science, and in no way represent the views of\nCSHL, its trustees, faculty, staff or students. The Laboratory condemns the\nmisuse of science to justify prejudice\u201d and his latest comments are \u201cutterly\nincompatible with our mission, values, and policies, and require the severing\nof any remaining vestiges of his involvement\u201d. The Trustees stripped him of\nhis remaining honorary titles, including honorary trustee and chancellor\nemeritus.\n\nAnother victim of the Equalitarians in the United States was Jason Richwine,\nwho had received a PhD from Harvard in 2009 with a dissertation IQ and\nImmigration Policy, in which he argued that Hispanics and Blacks have lower\naverage IQs than Whites, that this has a genetic basis and, as a result, they\nhave difficulty assimilating and are a drain on the economy and therefore\ntheir immigration should be reduced. After leaving Harvard, Richwine worked\nbriefly at the American Enterprise Institute and then joined the Heritage\nFoundation and published articles repeating these arguments. In 2013, he\npublished a study of the fiscal effects of an immigration amnesty in the\nUnited States, arguing that the costs would amount to $6.3 trillion, and\nrecommended that the United States should not let in immigrants with low IQs.\nThis proposal was widely denounced in the media. A week later the Heritage\nFoundation fired him.\n\nCharles Murray wrote on this: \u201cHis resignation is emblematic of a corruption\nthat has spread throughout American intellectual discourse. I have a personal\ninterest in this story because Jason Richwine was awarded a fellowship from my\nemployer, the American Enterprise Institute, in 2008, and I reviewed the draft\nof his dissertation. A re-reading of the dissertation last weekend confirmed\nmy recollection that Richwine had meticulously assembled and analyzed the\ntest-score data, which showed exactly what he said they showed: Mean IQ-score\ndifferences between Latinos and non-Latino Whites, found consistently across\nmany datasets and across time after taking factors such as language\nproficiency and cultural bias into account.\u201d\n\nIn February 2017, Charles Murray was attacked by students at Middlebury\nCollege in Vermont while about to give a lecture. Although he has never stated\na belief that the low Black IQ has a genetic basis, he has become a hate\nfigure for liberal students on account of his book The Bell Curve on race\ndifferences in IQs (written with Dick Herrnstein) and of his \u201cMurray\u2019s law\u201d, a\nset of conclusions in his book Losing Ground: American Social Policy,\n1950\u20131980, stating that social welfare programs for the poor encourage them to\ngo on welfare and increase their numbers.\n\nThere have also been attacks by Equalitarians on a number of those in Europe\nwho have written that there are racial and national differences in\nintelligence. In Britain in 1997, Christopher Brand was fired from his\nlectureship at Edinburgh University following the publication of his book The\ng Factor, in which he wrote that general intelligence is an important factor\nin determining life outcomes. He attributed the lower socio-economic status of\nBlacks to their lower intelligence and described himself as a race realist.\nFollowing these statements, students and a mob of the Anti-Nazi League\ndisrupted his lectures and his book was withdrawn by the publisher John Wiley.\nEdinburgh University fired him for conduct that \u201cbrought the university into\ndisrepute\u201d. Brand sued the university for unfair dismissal, won and received\n\u00a312,000, but he was not reinstated.\n\nIn 2006, Frank Ellis, a lecturer in Russian at the University of Leeds, gave\nan interview for the students\u2019 newspaper in which he said that Blacks have, on\naverage, a lower IQ and poorer academic achievement than Whites. The vice-\nchancellor of the university instituted disciplinary proceedings against him\nand threatened him with dismissal. The result of this was that Frank Ellis was\nforced to retire on a modest pension.\n\nIn October, 2018, the International Association of Educational and Vocational\nGuidance in Sweden invited Linda Gottfredson to give a keynote address on her\nwork on vocational aspirations, but subsequently disinvited her when it\ndiscovered she had published work on the genetic basis of race differences in\nintelligence.\n\nMy own experiences of attacks from Equalitarians have been fairly modest. When\nmy book Race Differences in Intelligence was published in 2006, Bill Regnery\nsent an advertisement for it to the Mensa Bulletin, published by American\nMensa, but the editor declined to take it. He wrote to Bill Regnery \u201cAs I\nexplained on the phone a few minutes ago, and according to the advertising\npolicies published in each edition of the Mensa Bulletin, all advertising\nmaterials and copy are subject to approval or rejection by the publisher.\nAfter reviewing the content of your ad for the book Race Differences in\nIntelligence by Richard Lynn, excerpts from the book, and related Web sites,\nwe have decided not to accept this ad for publication in the Mensa Bulletin.\u201d\nThis was an example of the informal censorship of studies showing race\ndifferences that has become increasingly prevalent.\n\nWhen I was at the University of Ulster, coachloads of the Anti-Nazi League\ncame to the university on two occasions, disrupted my lectures and put up\nposters demanding my dismissal. The university authorities should have called\nthe police as they were causing an affray but did nothing to stop them. When I\nretired in 1995, I was appointed professor emeritus. In February, 2018, the\nstudents\u2019 union passed a motion demanding that my status as emeritus professor\nbe rescinded because my publications documenting race and sex differences in\nintelligence might be hurtful to minorities and women. In March, the vice-\nchancellor informed me that the university had acceded to this demand. I\nbelieve this is the only time an emeritus professor has had his title revoked.\nAnd so with this act of petty vindictiveness I have achieved a unique\ndistinction.\n\nLooking towards the future, I agree with Jim Watson who wrote at the end of\nhis autobiography that \u201cThere is no reason to anticipate that the intellectual\ncapacities of peoples geographically separated in their evolution should prove\nto have evolved identically\u201d and \u201cwhen asked how many years would pass before\nthe genes affecting differences in human intelligence would be found, my back-\nof-the envelope answer would be fifteen years\u201d (Watson, 2007, p. 326) [45].\nLarge studies that identify genes (rather, genetic variants) associated with\nintelligence have been published since 2013 (Rietveld et al.) [46], with the\nmost recent study being Lee et al. (2018) [47]. Piffer (2019; this issue) [48]\nreported the newest analysis of how these genetic variants related to group\ndifferences worldwide and found that they are roughly in line with known group\ndifferences, though his claims are still controversial. When the causal\ngenetic variants are more definitely identified we can anticipate a huge\nhostile reception. Many scientists will not dare to give their opinion on it\nand those who endorse it will be viciously attacked. The uproar will be\ncomparable to that following Charles Darwin\u2019s publication of his Origin of\nSpecies in 1859 which undermined faith in Christianity and about which one old\nlady is said to have observed \u201cLet us hope it is not true; if it is true, let\nus hope the lower classes to not hear of it.\u201d Eventually, however, it will\nbecome accepted. Magna est veritas, et praevalebit.\n\n## References\n\n  1. Heim, A. The Appraisal of Intelligence; Methuen: London, UK, 1954. [Google Scholar]\n  2. UNESCO.
