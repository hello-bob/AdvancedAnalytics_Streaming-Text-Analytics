Smith\n\n###### April 18, 2024 6 mins\n\nAs a tenured professor of biology and genetics at Harvard Medical School,\nDavid Sinclair has long been the world\u2019s most qualified \u201cbiohacker\u201d. The term\nrefers to a broad community that attempts to enhance bodily performance,\nsometimes through simple treatments like meditation. But some of its advocates\ngo much further. Sinclair himself has turned his body into a walking\nlaboratory to test his controversial thesis: that ageing itself is a treatable\ndisease.\n\nLooking incredibly young has certainly helped his case \u2014 even now, at 54,\nSinclair could still pass for a 30-something. A decade ago, Time featured\nSinclair on its annual list of the world\u2019s most influential people. And by\npopularising the concept of \u201cautophagy\u201d, Sinclair has almost certainly\ninfluenced you at some point.\n\nAutophagy, which comes from the Greek for \u201cself-devouring\u201d, refers to the\nprocess by which cells deprived of fresh supplies of glucose are forced to\n\u201cfeed off\u201d themselves, reducing the inflammatory toxins that are so synonymous\nwith ageing and, in theory, revitalising the mitochondria that power every\ncell. While Silicon Valley tech bros such as Brian Johnson, Peter Thiel and\nJeff Bezos may have garnered more headlines, a lone maverick scientist, in\nscience-fiction style, was busy working on the medical secret to substantiate\ntheir quest for eternal youth. Or so it seemed.\n\nNowadays, former colleagues in academia are queueing up to denounce Sinclair.\nIn March, when he announced with his brother that their company Animal\nBioscience had developed a supplement for dogs \u201cshown to reverse the effects\nof age related decline\u201d, it proved to be the final straw. A former research\npartner, and colleague at Harvard Medical School, labelled him \u201cthe textbook\ndefinition of snake-oil salesman\u201d, before Sinclair resigned from his role as\nPresident of the Academy for Health and Lifespan Research on 13 March.\n\nSo where did it all go so wrong for Sinclair? After all, it\u2019s not as though\nTime were wrong to cite his influence \u2014 which has become ubiquitous by\nstealth. With the unmasking of one of its leaders, where next for the\nbiohacking movement? And is there more to it than billionaire daydreams and\nsketchy online apothecaries?\n\nSuggested reading\n\n##### The assisted-dying lobby has already won\n\nBy Kathleen Stock\n\nIn many ways, it simply continues to grow. Because calorie restriction has\nbeen consistently shown to increase lifespan in laboratory animals, Sinclair\u2019s\nchampioning of autophagy to stabilise lower blood sugars has seeped into\npopular consciousness as a rationale for weight-loss \u201chacks\u201d that might also\nhelp you live longer. Advocates of intermittent fasting, buttered coffee,\nultra-low carb diets, cold-water immersion or drinking diluted vinegar\ninvariably invoke the implied cloak of scientific legitimacy that autophagy\nprovides. And Sinclair personally aligned himself and his clout with these\nsorts of trends. By taking just one meal and 1,100 calories per day, and\nfocusing on plant-based, low-carb, low-protein, and heart-healthy high-fat\nfoods, he promoted the \u201cdeep cleanse\u201d cellular repair and ultimate detox that\nautophagy is meant to provide. In turn, autophagy is in large part responsible\nfor the popularity of the so-called 16:8 diet, whose adherents consume their\ncalories in an eight-hour window before fasting for the next 16 to maintain\nlow-blood sugars.\n\nSo, when the American Heart Foundation published research last month\nindicating that restricted-eating-window diets of the 16:8 variety were linked\nto 91% higher risk of cardiovascular deaths, they rattled many of the\nintermittent fasting advocates. But Sinclair had already been testing the\nscientific establishment\u2019s patience for years. By suggesting that non-\ndiabetics should consider taking the diabetes drug Metformin, for longevity\npurposes, as he did, Sinclair had long courted controversy, and not just from\noutside of the biohacking community but from within it.\n\nBecause if Sinclair is the father of anti-ageing biomedicine, Oedipal forces\nhave been massing against him for some time. On 10 March, Dr Brad Stanfield,\nanother noted longevity influencer, launched a withering takedown of his\ncareer and record. Stanfield alleged that by setting up companies trading in\nanti-ageing supplements of dubious merit, Sinclair amassed a personal fortune.\nInitially, it was resveratrol, the much hyped \u201cmiracle\u201d compound found in red\nwine. According to Stanfield, GlaxoSmithKline bought the rights to the\nresearch for $720 million dollars and spent five years trying and failing to\nreplicate Sinclair\u2019s findings. More recently, again without compelling\nclinical evidence from human trials, Sinclair has been advocating for and\nmarketing the supplement NMN to boost NAD+ levels, in order \u2014 he said \u2014 to\nencourage DNA repair and enhance insulin sensitivity.\n\nSuch internal feuding demonstrates the reality of the biohacking movement.\nBecause, while the public has a tendency to conflate longevity science with\nplutocrats obsessed with living forever, the movement is far from an elite\nproject. Many biohackers are in late-middle age and have more grounded\nexpectations. When I meet John Hemmings, a 63-year-old biohacker, he explains\nthat by extending his \u201chealthspan\u201d he hopes to \u201ccompress his morbidity\u201d and\ndelay the onset of age-related conditions such as heart disease, diabetes,\ncancer and, in particular, Alzheimer\u2019s. Hemmings is hardly your average\nsubject matter \u2014 in an earlier political career, he was a Lib Dem MP who used\nparliamentary privilege to denounce Ryan Giggs\u2019s attempts to use a super-\ninjunction to silence press coverage of his private life. But in other ways,\nHemmings\u2019s anxieties are representative, given that, on average, senior\ncitizens rack up five separate comorbidity diagnoses by the age of 80. It\u2019s\neasy to see why some might seek more control over their exit strategy.\n\nMore from this author\n\n##### The men paying to be taller\n\nBy Sean T. Smith\n\nHemming\u2019s new career as a committed biohacker began in earnest in 2020 when,\nat 21 stone, he realised that was a likely candidate for type 2 diabetes. He\nmanaged to lose seven stone in just nine months (a process he broadcast on\nsocial media) by making use of a device designed for diabetics. A skin sensor\nallowed him to perform continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and track his blood\nsugar in real time through an app. For the first time he could see how levels\nspiked and fell in relation to different meals and activities. Preventing\nspikes means eliminating the crashes that inevitably follow, which reduces\nhunger pangs and helps weight loss. And CGM is the most prevalent biohacking\ntrend of the moment. For many, weight loss is the primary goal, but for\nothers, like Hemmings, it\u2019s a gateway to biohacking through which the ultimate\nprize of a longer, healthier life first becomes visible. That higher glucose\nlevels act as an ageing accelerator is the central premise of the longevity\ncommunity, but Hemmings quickly realised its limitations. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if\nthere is just one number that matters. It requires a holistic approach.\u201d\n\nToday, he spends around \u00a310,000 a year on weekly blood tests to track the\neffects of his various interventions on key biomarkers as a way of stalling\nageing at a cellular level. And he is now a convert-turned-preacher: he\npublishes blogs replete with homespun microbiological research that track the\nimpact of his treatments. More radically, these include rapamycin, which\nHemmings sources from India. Although it\u2019s a potentially harmful\nimmunosuppressant used to prevent the rejection of kidney transplants,\nrapamycin has also been shown to extend lifespans in animal trials and is the\nlongevity community\u2019s greatest hope of a \u201cquick win\u201d against ageing. Hemmings\nbelieves rapamycin is likely to be a more effective method than fasting when\nit comes to inducing that all important state of autophagy.\n\nHe monitors his long-term progress through epigenetic tests \u2014 a type of\nbiochemical assessment that looks at DNA to see how well cells are ageing in\nrelation to their chronological age (he proudly tells me that one put his age\nat 53, and another at just 36). But with his political background, Hemmings\nsees his personal travails as heralding social change. He believes that our\nhealth service is out of date because it is predicated on repairing the damage\ncaused by our afflictions, by which time it\u2019s often already too late.\n\u201cBiohacking enables people to have detailed information as to what they can do\nto improve how their bodies function in the short term. Hence rather than\nwaiting to get ill and then going in and out of health care, the level of\npersonal health can be maintained,\u201d he says.\n\nDespite all the money he has spent, Hemmings represents the grassroots of the\nbiohacking movement \u2014 those seeking their own routes to longevity. And he has\nlong been sceptical of figures like Sinclair: \u201cThe science just isn\u2019t strong\nenough to support some of the claims he\u2019s been making.\u201d Instead, it is other\nleading longevity podcasters such as Dr Peter Attia and the newly emergent\nvoice of Dr Stanfield who are likely to benefit from Sinclair\u2019s\ndefenestration. As a practising GP in Auckland, with clinical expertise in\nhelping people age gracefully, Stanfield in particular has become Sinclair\u2019s\nonline nemesis.\n\n\u201cWhat works for laboratory rodents doesn\u2019t necessarily apply to large mammals\nlike human beings.\u201d\n\nBoth Stanfield and Attia are physicians, and appear comparably mindful of\ntheir Hippocratic responsibility to, first, do no harm. Both tend to wait\nuntil multiple clinical studies converge around similar findings before\nrecommending supplements. And both have identified the worrying tendency of\nlongevity researchers such as Sinclair to conflate the evidence from animal\nand human trials. Looked at independently, the evidence from human trials\nalone often tells a very different story. And Sinclair\u2019s entire theory of\nautophagy may well prove to be a classic example of this pattern. What works\nfor laboratory rodents doesn\u2019t necessarily apply to large mammals like human\nbeings. Stanfield cites evidence suggesting that humans would need to fast for\nfour days to derive the autophagy benefits that can be induced in mice in just\n16 hours.\n\nLike Attia, Stanfield regards autophagy as a dangerous distraction, and beyond\nshort-term weight loss, he contests the idea that calorie restriction and\nfasting has any long-term longevity benefits, a stance now echoed by the\nAmerican Heart study. What\u2019s more, depriving your body of vital nutrients like\nprotein for 16 hours a day is a high-risk strategy, given that human studies\nshow that frailty is the commonest factor in all-cause mortality. As Attia\nargues, unless we mitigate \u201csarcopenia\u201d, the age-related loss of skeletal\nmuscle mass and strength which normally begins in our 30s, ultimately frailty\nwill be our undoing \u2014 even if it\u2019s not listed on our death certificates.\n\nBy advocating fasting and low-protein intake, Sinclair has been flying in the\nface of preventative care clinical guidelines for years. It seems that you can\nbe a serious research scientist or an entrepreneur, but not both (and by\npushing supplements for dogs, Sinclair appears to have opted for neither). But\nperhaps the work of more serious figures like Attia and Stanfield shows that\nwhat we currently call biohacking could ultimately become part of general\nmedical treatment. Given that the global market for anti-ageing biomedicine is\nprojected to be worth $93 billion by 2027, they are certainly unlikely to be\nthe last to try and realise its immortal temptations.\n\nSean T.

Once they up their protein and fat, cut the\nsimple carbs, and replace excessive cardio with strength training they improve\nacross the board. Including fasting also is incredibly helpful, although\nthat\u2019s a step too far for many. Autophagy is a wonderful thing if you can\nhandle abstaining from food for a day on occasion.

Its\nskipping breakfast..youre not going to go in to nutrient deficiency doing\nthat. It just gives your system a rest. Its a great starting point for good\nhealth Call it bio hacking if you will but to me its just what feels healthy\nand natural. Second, what do we mean by bio hacking ? Is it just basic health\npractices or does it mean taking random drugs that might help autophagy etc.\nIm very scoopydupious about the drugs. But fasting makes sense. We evolved as\nhunter gatherers who probably had a meat feast a couple of times a week. That\nwould be pretty extreme but would probably extend our lives. Given it takes\n20-25 years for us to grow fully, we probably should be making 100-120 years\nhandy enough if you compare with other animals if we avoid stress, accidents\nand t oo much sedentary activities.
