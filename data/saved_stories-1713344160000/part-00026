According to\nassociate professor of health care policy and medicine Zirui Song and other\nHarvard researchers, patients in hospitals owned by private equity firms\nsuffered significantly more hospital-acquired adverse events than those being\ncared for in similar hospitals with no such investor participation. Song,\ndirector of research at Harvard Medical School\u2019s Center for Primary Care,\nanalyzed more than 4.8 million Medicare claims tied to hospital stays between\n2009 and 2019. Patients in the hospitals acquired by private equity firms\nexperienced 25.4 percent more hospital-acquired conditions. Underlying that\nalarming overall difference was a 37.7 percent increase in central-line\nassociated bloodstream infections and a 27.3 percent increase in falls,\ncompared to peer hospitals with no private equity involvement.\n\nInvestors have taken a $1-trillion stake during the past decade in everything\nfrom nursing homes to physicians\u2019 practices and hospitals.\n\nThose adverse events matter when one considers how private equity has expanded\nin healthcare in recent years, with investors taking a $1-trillion stake\nduring the past decade in everything from nursing homes and rehabilitation\nfacilities to physicians\u2019 practices and hospitals. According to the nonprofit\nPrivate Equity Stakeholder Project, approximately 460 U.S. hospitals are\ncurrently owned by private equity firms, representing eight percent of all\nprivate hospitals and 22 percent of all proprietary for-profit hospitals.\n\nThe recent study, published in the Journal of the American Medical\nAssociation, builds on another conducted in 2020, in which Song and his\ncolleagues found private equity investment more financially favorable for\nhospitals in the three years after acquisition. But the earlier work, he says,\ngave little insight into patient outcomes. \u201cWe wanted to study more clinically\nmeaningful, granular measures of quality of care being delivered on the ground\nin the hospitals,\u201d Song says, \u201cand the changes in those more clinically\nnuanced measures attributable to private equity acquisition.\u201d\n\nThe latest findings have led the researchers to wonder whether financially\nmotivated cost-cutting practices explain the spike in patient complications.\nIn follow-up work now under review, he and a team of researchers are examining\nchanges in staffing levels and hospital expenses in relation to patient\noutcomes after private equity investors take over hospitals. Says Song, \u201cWe\nhypothesize that the primary mechanism behind these increases in patient\nadverse events is reductions in staffing and other expenses.\u201d\n\nA 2021 joint report by the American Antitrust Institute and the Petris Center\nat the University of California, Berkeley, notes estimated annual private\nequity deals in healthcare increased in value from $41.5 billion in 2010 to\n$119.9 billion in 2019. Investors commit their funds in expectation of earning\nsignificant returns. The problem, many critics complain, is the fundamental\nfinancial strategy at the heart of most private equity deals, healthcare-\nrelated or otherwise, known as the leveraged buyout. In leveraged deals, the\ncost of an acquisition is largely funded with money borrowed against the\ntarget company\u2019s assets and anticipated cash flows. It\u2019s a high-risk, high-\nreward approach: a heavy debt load can strain a company\u2019s resources.\n\n\u201cThis debt is not trivial. For the millions of dollars an acquisition costs,\nif a majority is borrowed money or debt-financed, the acquired entity\u2019s own\ninfrastructure, its buildings and machines and land are used as the collateral\nfor that debt,\u201d says Song. \u201cAnd the acquired entity faces an additional\npressure to generate increased cash flow and revenues after acquisition to\nbegin paying down interest on the debt.\u201d\n\nOne need look no further than Massachusetts and the Steward Health Care\nSystem. In 2010, the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management bought a\nchain of Catholic hospitals, rebranding it as Steward. In 2016, Steward sold\nits medical properties to another entity, Medical Properties Trust, in part to\nhelp pay down debt and repay Cerberus. Today, Steward is struggling. In a\nFebruary letter, Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey demanded the company\ndisclose its financial documents, suggesting that it \u201cseems\u201d Steward and its\nCEO \u201cchose to maximize profits and... corporate gains at the expense of\npatients, workers, and the state and federal healthcare system.\u201d The entire\nSteward system is thought to be on the verge of financial failure.\n\nBut many, including Song, agree the infusions of cash and managerial expertise\na private equity firm can bring to a struggling hospital or physicians\u2019 chain\ncan be helpful. According to the Sheps Center at the University of North\nCarolina, since 2010, 148 rural hospitals have either closed completely or no\nlonger offer in-patient services. Private equity, says Song, could \u201cin theory\nhelp to keep those hospitals open and maintain access for the community,\nespecially for a rural community without other options.\u201d The key, however, is\nthat \u201cinvesting in a hospital need not necessitate cutting expenses, reducing\nthe staff, and potentially having patients get hurt,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe first step\ndoesn\u2019t necessarily mean the second has to happen.\u201d\n\nMany policymakers and clinicians believe that for the patients\u2019 sake, private\nequity takeovers need better oversight and transparency. Song and his\ncolleagues think states could better enforce existing regulations designed to\nprevent commercial exploitation of physicians, though most states have broad\nexceptions to these \u201ccorporate practice of medicine\u201d laws. States might also\ngrant their attorneys general more authority to block private equity\nhealthcare deals they deem harmful to patients or to competition. Federal\npolicymakers and legal scholars have put forth similar views. Critics also\nsuggest lowering the threshold for mandatory reporting of private equity deals\nto the Securities and Exchange Commission, established by the Hart-Scott-\nRodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. Currently, that ceiling, which\nchanges yearly, stands at $119.5 million. Song notes, \u201cMost private equity\nacquisitions, especially of physician practices, are well below that\nthreshold, so they never get reported.\u201d\n\nIn a recent policy paper, Song and Eckstein professor of applied economics\nDavid M. Cutler, a healthcare economist, outline possible reforms involving\nprivate equity investment in healthcare, including increased state monitoring\nof private equity deals, making firms wait longer to recoup money from private\ninvestment as capital gains, and requiring private equity investors to set\naside money in an escrow account to be used in the event of failure.\n\n\u201cIn healthcare, the corporatization train has left the station, and is\naccelerating rapidly on lightly regulated tracks,\u201d they write. \u201cWhat remains\nneeded is thoughtful policy that builds some guardrails, applies the brakes\nwhere appropriate, and avoids derailment when patients could suffer.\u201d\n\nRead more articles by: Colleen Walsh\n\nSub topics\n\nFaculty & Research\n\nSocial Sciences\n\nHealth & Medicine\n\n## You might also like\n\n### Slow and Steady\n\nA Harvard Law School graduate completes marathons in all 50 states.\n\n### Claudine Gay in First Post-Presidency Appearance\n\nAt Morning Prayers, speaks of resilience and the unknown\n\n### The Dark History Behind Chocolate\n\nA Harvard course on the politics and culture of food\n\n## Most popular\n\n### Claudine Gay in First Post-Presidency Appearance\n\nAt Morning Prayers, speaks of resilience and the unknown\n\n### Developing Dads\n\nExploring the evolutionary biology of human fathers as caretakers\n\n### The Gravity of Groups\n\nMina Cikara explores how political tribalism feeds the American bipartisan\ndivide.\n\n## More to explore\n\nFeatures\n\n### Exploring Political Tribalism and American Politics\n\nMina Cikara explores how political tribalism feeds the American bipartisan\ndivide.\n\nRight Now\n\n### Private Equity in Medicine and the Quality of Care\n\nHundreds of U.S. hospitals are owned by private equity firms\u2014does monetizing\nmedicine affect the quality of care?\n\nJohn Harvard's Journal\n\n### Construction on Commercial Enterprise Research Campus in Allston\n\nConstruction on Harvard\u2019s commercial enterprise research campus and new\ntheater in Allston\n\n##\n\nContact\n\n  * Contact/About\n  * Staff\n  * Submit a Class Note\n  * Submit an Obituary\n  * Submit a Letter to the Editor\n  * Apply for a Fellowship\n\n##\n\nCustomer Service\n\n  * Customer Service\n\n##\n\nABOUT\n\n  * Harvard Magazine History\n  * Map and Directions\n  * Privacy Policy\n\n##\n\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\n\n  * Subscriptions\n  * Order a Subscription\n  * Renew a Subscription\n  * Give a Gift Subscription\n  * Questions About Your Subscription\n\n##\n\nNEWSLETTERS\n\n  * Newsletters\n\n##\n\nADVERTISE\n\n  * National Edition\n  * New England Regional Edition/Harvard Squared\n  * Classifieds\n  * Digital Advertising\n  * Ad Sizes | Specifications\n  * Deadlines\n\n##\n\nFAQ\n\n  * FAQ\n\n##### Current issue\n\nAll Content \u00a9 1996-2023 Harvard Magazine Inc.
