At the same time, it is coming to light that the U.S. has already\nsupplied additional ATACMS ballistic missiles to Ukraine, and reportedly, for\nthe first time, longer-range variants, under a secret transfer operation, the\nworks of which we have seen recently.\n\nThe announcement came moments after President Joe Biden said during a White\nHouse speech that he had signed into law a $95 billion national security\nsupplemental aid package that includes about $61 billion for Ukraine. It\npassed the House on Saturday, and the Senate approved it Tuesday.\n\nThe equipment, much of it already stationed in neighboring European countries,\nis expected to start flowing into Ukraine quickly, Biden said.\n\n\"I'm making sure the shipments start right away,\" said Biden. \"In the next few\nhours, literally in a few hours, will begin sending equipment to Ukraine for\nair defense munitions, for artillery for rocket systems and armored vehicles.\"\n\nThe new Pentagon aid package is the 56th round tranche of equipment provided\nfrom the Defense Department to Ukraine under Presidential Drawdown Authority,\nwhich means it is coming from existing U.S. stocks.\n\nThe capabilities in this announcement include:\n\n  * RIM-7 and AIM-9M missiles for air defense;\n  * Stinger anti-aircraft missiles;\n  * Small arms and additional rounds of small arms ammunition, including .50 caliber rounds to counter Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS);\n  * Additional ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS);\n  * 155mm artillery rounds, including High Explosive and Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions rounds;\n  * 105mm artillery rounds;\n  * 60mm mortar rounds;\n  * Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles;\n  * Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles (MRAPs);\n  * High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs);\n  * Logistics support vehicles;\n  * Tactical vehicles to tow and haul equipment;\n  * Tube-Launched, Optically-Tracked, Wire-Guided (TOW) missiles;\n  * Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor systems;\n  * Precision aerial munitions;\n  * Airfield support equipment;\n  * Anti-armor mines;\n  * Claymore anti-personnel munitions;\n  * Demolitions munitions for obstacle clearing; and\n  * Night vision devices; and\n  * Spare parts, field equipment, training munitions, maintenance, and other ancillary equipment.\n\nThe new aid package includes an unspecified amount of additional 155mm\nartillery shells. (U.S. Army photo) US Army\n\nWhile the Pentagon did not specify which types of HIMARS munitions it will\nprovide Ukraine, the law Biden signed requires the transfer of longer-range\nArmy Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missile variants\nthat are fired by HIMARS systems \"as soon as practicable.\" Those are able to\nhit targets up to 186 miles (300 kilometers). Previous versions of the weapon\nsent to Ukraine were earlier types capable of significantly less range, of\naround 103 miles, and carried only cluster munitions.\n\nCNN reported that the aid package will likely contain the longer-range ATACMS,\nbut additional reporting from multiple outlets now states that those munitions\nhave already been secretly sent to Ukraine.\n\nUkraine been using the very limited number of these weapons it has received to\ndevastating effect, and most recently used the longer-range variants in an\nattack on Russian air defense systems in Crimea last week, according to\nReuters.\n\nAs we noted in our story about that attack, there was a seeming gap in\nUkrainian ATACMS launches. The first tranche of about 20 ATACMS short-range\nvariants arrived in Ukraine in October and were apparently mostly used during\nattacks on Russian-held airfields the same month. Since then, we haven't seem\nmuch evidence that additional ATACMS were on hand and the lack of U.S. aid\nsupported the idea that no more were handed over. Then the strike on Russia's\nairbase occurred, which pointed to a new delivery. So it seems as if\nadditional examples were delivered clandestinely. In addition, today's media\naccounts gives added context to previous reports in March that additional\n(cluster-warhead versions) of ATACMS were headed to Ukraine.\n\nDzhankoi Air Base, which is home to multiple helicopters, tactical jets, and\nhigh-end ground-based air defense systems, came under a Ukrainian attack April\n17.

Garron Garn, a Pentagon spokesman, would not confirm whether\nthe longer-range ATACMS were included in the package or say how many of the\nother items are heading to Ukraine.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we\u2019re not able to provide additional details to what is\nalready listed in the release,\" he told The War Zone. \"We do not provide the\nnumber of munitions, or variants/models in some cases, for operational\nsecurity considerations and to preserve the tactical advantage for Ukraine on\nthe battlefield.\"\n\nWhether the U.S. imposes target restrictions on the use of the longer-range\nATACMS if they are provided remains to be seen. Those weapon can hit targets\nwell into Russia as well as all of occupied Crimea and the U.S. in the past\nhas asked Ukraine not use its donated arms against targets across the border.\n\nThe package that Biden signed into law Wednesday also includes billions for\nIsrael and Taiwan. It \"comes on the heels of an announcement by the U.K. on\nTuesday, pledging an additional $620 million in new military supplies for\nUkraine, including long-range missiles and 4 million rounds of ammunition,\"\naccording to the AP.\n\nThe U.S. measure came after months of U.S. internal political turmoil, which\ndelayed support for Ukraine, which is facing an increasingly tough fight.\n\nUkrainian officials and U.S. backers of the funding measure have been warning\nthat the lack of assistance from Washington has imperiled Kyiv's forces, which\nare desperately low on ammunition, particularly 155mm shells and air defense\nmunitions.\n\nUkraine has seen Russia attempting to make advances across the front,\nespecially in Donetsk Oblast around the towns of Chasiv Yar, Avdiivka and\nDonetsk City. Those attempts have been helped by Ukrainian ammunition\nshortages.\n\nWith Ukrainian air defense munitions in short supply as well, Russia has been\nbetter able to use its tactical aviation to help its ground troops. A recent\nexample is the push toward the town of Ocheretyne near Avdiivka.\n\n\"In preparation for this move, Russian aviation conducted air strikes with FAB\nglide bombs on Ukrainian positions along the planned Russian axis of advance\nand the Ukrainian-held town of Ocheretyne,\" the Ukrainian Euromaidan Press\nnews outlet reported Wednesday.\n\nRussia has also been hitting Ukrainian cities and energy infrastructure with\nair, sea and ground-launched missiles, as well as drones. While the new aid\npackage does not include Patriot air defense munitions, it does include RIM-7\nSea Sparrow surface-to-air missiles, which as we noted previously were\nintegrated onto the Ukrainian Armed Forces\u2019 existing Soviet-era Buk air\ndefense systems. It also includes AIM-9 Sidewinders, which have been\nincorporated into so-called FrankenSAM air defense systems. You can read more\nabout those here.\n\nThe new package also includes an unspecified number of Bradley Fighting\nVehicles. The U.S. has already provided Ukraine with more than 200 Bradleys,\nbut a large number of them have already been lost. According to the Oryx open\nsource tracking group, Ukraine has seen 34 Bradleys destroyed, 24 damaged, 14\nabandoned and four captured. Those numbers could actually be higher, because\nOryx only tabulates equipment for which it has visual confirmation.\n\nVideo of destroyed Bradleys first emerged on social media in June 2023, which\nyou can see below.\n\nDespite the ammo shortages, Ukraine has been able to inflict heavy casualties\non Russian forces and, in limited cases, claw back some of its lost ground.\nHowever, without needed supplies, it remains questionable how long Ukraine can\nkeep pushing back or defend against an expected increase in Russian offensive\noperations.\n\nDuring his speech at the White House, Biden said Ukraine has been holding out\ndespite the delay in U.S. help and while Russia's allies have been supplying\nit with arms and assistance.\n\n\"Putin's friends are keeping him well-supplied,\" said Biden. \"Iran sent him\ndrones, North Korea has sent him ballistic missiles and artillery shells.\nChina has provided components and know how to boost Russia's defense\nproduction. With all the support, Russia has racked up with airstrikes against\nUkrainian cities and critical infrastructure. Rained down munitions on brave\nUkrainians defending their homeland. And now America is going to send Ukraine\nsupplies they need to keep them in the fight.\"\n\nUkrainian officials have expressed tremendous gratitude for the help.\n\nWhile the equipment may flow into Ukraine quickly, how soon and how much of a\ndifference it will make remains to be seen.\n\n\"So we will see when all this cargo arrives in Ukraine,\" Lt. Gen. Kyrylo\nBudanov, head of the Defense Intelligence Directorate, told The War Zone. \"We\nneeded this cargo a long time ago. So it will be like fresh air for us now.\"\n\nContact the author: howard@thewarzone.com\n\nAmericasAround The GlobeArtilleryEuropeM142 HIMARSMGM-140 Army Tactical\nMissile System (ATACMS)Multiple-Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS)Tactical Ballistic\nMissilesU.S. HomelandUkraine\n\nSign Up For Our Newsletters\n\nSign Up\n\n  * About TWZ\n  * The Team\n  * Contact Us\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Sitemap\n\n\u00a9 2024 Recurrent Ventures.
