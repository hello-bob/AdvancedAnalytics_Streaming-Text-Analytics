You don\u2019t find that out on Twitter. You have to find\nout from old people. They\u2019re the only people that know.\u201d (As someone in the\nnews, I am duty bound to report that stamps\u2019 price increased from $0.66 to\n$0.68 on January 21.)\n\nBut stamps aren\u2019t yet entirely anachronistic. Yes, the volume of first-class\nmail has been on the decline, but the U.S. Postal Service still sells about\n12.5 billion stamps annually. Some of this is a matter of taste. \u201cThere are\ncertain things where physical mail is still seen as the socially correct way\nto do things,\u201d says Daniel Piazza, the chief curator of philately at the\nSmithsonian National Postal Museum, pointing to mailing wedding invitations,\nbirthday notes, and holiday cards.\n\nBut stamps serve a purpose that is not merely functional. If you look back far\nenough, they also tell a story about national identity, and the technological\nand cultural trajectory of America. Stamps \u201care both miniature art works and\npieces of government propaganda,\u201d Dennis Altman wrote in his 1991 book, Paper\nAmbassadors: The Politics of Stamps. \u201cThey can be used to promote sovereignty,\ncelebrate achievement, define national, racial, religious, or linguistic\nidentity, portray messages or exhort certain behaviour.\u201d\n\nRichard Morel, the curator of the British Library\u2019s Philatelic Collection, put\nit to me more succinctly: \u201cStamps democratize our history and culture.\u201d In\nshort, the history of U.S. stamps tells a story of America.\n\nThe postage stamp as we know it today is a relatively young technology. Prior\nto the mid-1800s, \u201cmost letters were sent collect, so postage was paid by the\nrecipient of the letter rather than by the sender,\u201d Piazza told me. This\nturned out to be a very bad business model for the Postal Service. First, it\nrequired people to go to their post office to see whether they had mail. In\nfact, postmasters paid to run ads in local papers listing who had letters to\ncollect so those people would retrieve them. (One true constant across time\nseems to be that people consider going to the post office a chore.) Then, if\nthere was a letter for someone and they did pick it up, the receiver had to\npay the postage, which they sometimes refused to do, given its expense. \u201cSo\nit\u2019s a very cumbersome, sort of expensive system\u201d for both the Postal Service\nand the receivers of mail, Piazza said.\n\nRead: One Thousand Stamps, All Different (1939)\n\nUntil a breakthrough in 1840. The U.K. issued the Penny Black, the world\u2019s\nfirst prepaid, adhesive stamp. With this stamp, people could send a half-ounce\nletter for a flat, prepaid rate of one penny. The Penny Black featured the\nface of Queen Victoria, and, in a sign of the times, some people believed that\n\u201clicking the back of the queen\u2019s head was undignified, if not potentially\ntreasonous,\u201d Altman wrote in his book. On a recent visit to the British\nLibrary, I was able to see the last remaining press of the type that printed\nthe Penny Black. Displayed on the library\u2019s upper-ground floor, the\nmachine\u2014which was smaller than I had imagined, given its function\u2014looked as\ndelicate as an antiquity of the Industrial Revolution can, with its large\nspindle, rope pulleys, and iron weights.\n\nLeft: The Penny Black printing press. Right: Penny Black, the world\u2019s first\npre-paid, adhesive stamp. (Siqi Li for The Atlantic)\n\nThis British innovation in stamp production set the path for other countries\nto follow. In the 1840s and \u201950s, several other nations developed their own\npostage stamps. The U.S. issued its first ones on July 1, 1847: a five-cent\nstamp featuring Benjamin Franklin, the country\u2019s first postmaster general, and\na 10-cent stamp featuring George Washington. (Washington, distinguished in so\nmany ways, also has the distinction of having more appearances on U.S. stamps\nthan anyone else.)\n\nThe start of stamps in the U.S. was an unheralded affair. A postmaster in\nMaine mailed a letter\u2014without a stamp, postage due\u2014to the postmaster general\nto inquire whether the stamps his office had received were \u201cgenuine,\u201d\naccording to Smithsonian Magazine. But by 1856, all mail required federal,\nprepaid postage stamps, and we largely entered the state of postage stamps as\nwe know them today. Or, as Morel put it, their invention \u201ctriggered our\ninformation revolution.\u201d\n\nStamp design, however, took a little longer to develop. For decades, American\nstamps followed the aesthetics of coin-face design, that is, profile drawings\nof heads of state. In our case, primarily dead presidents: George Washington,\nThomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson. The U.S. didn\u2019t begin issuing commemorative\nstamps until 1893, timed to the World\u2019s Fair in Chicago, with a series of 16\nstamps celebrating the 400th anniversary of Columbus\u2019s voyage to the New\nWorld. Included in the series was a depiction of Queen Isabella of Spain,\nmaking her the first woman featured on a U.S. stamp. (The first American woman\non a stamp was Martha Washington, in 1902.)\n\nIn the 130 years since that first commemorative stamp, hundreds and hundreds\nmore designs have been issued. U.S. postage stamps have celebrated momentous\nevents, such as the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid New York, home of the\nfirst U.S. Winter Olympics Games, and the moon landing, in 1969. There have\nbeen many stamp firsts: the first Hispanic American (Admiral David Farragut,\n1903), the first Native American (Pocahontas, 1907), the first African\nAmerican (Booker T. Washington, 1940). Some stamps impart social messages:\nPrevent Drug Abuse (1971) or Alcoholism: You Can Beat It (1981). They\u2019ve even\nbeen used to fund causes. The Breast Cancer Research semipostal has sold more\nthan 1 billion stamps since it was first issued, in 1998, and has raised\nmillions of dollars for the cause.\n\n\u201cIf you compare some of the American stamp designs ... to other countries\u2019,\nthey\u2019re incredibly progressive much earlier on,\u201d Morel said. There\u2019s the Black\nHeritage Series, which began in 1978 with an image of Harriet Tubman and still\nruns today with annual new releases. Helen Keller and Anne Sullivan were\ncommemorated on a stamp in 1980. Even designs that might now be seen as dated\nor insensitive were bold in their own time. In 1969, the U.S. Postal Service\nissued a stamp that featured an image of a young child gradually emerging out\nof a wheelchair. The language on the stamp reads, Hope for the crippled. \u201cThe\nlanguage is now problematic,\u201d Morel said, \u201cbut it\u2019s the intent that underlies\nthe stamp design, which is actually a positive one.\u201d\n\nThese design decisions are not made lightly. In 1957, the Postal Service\ncreated the Citizens\u2019 Stamp Advisory Committee, which consists of a group of\npeople from across disciplines who consider stamp recommendations from the\npublic. Anyone can suggest any subject to the council, which will weigh the\nrecommendation so long as it meets its healthy list of criteria\u2014for example,\nthe design should honor a subject or a figure that made a significant\ncontribution to American life, and the commemorated can\u2019t be a living person.\n\nLeft: The Inverted Jenny. Right: Two people print a sheet of stamps at the\nBureau of Engraving and Printing, Stamp Division, around 1890. (Siqi Li for\nThe Atlantic)\n\nIt\u2019s a deliberative process that can take several years\u2014and for good reason.\nNearly any stamp design is certain to irritate someone. In the early 1990s,\nwhen the Postal Service announced that it would be releasing a stamp featuring\nElvis, some Americans were scandalized. They couldn\u2019t fathom the idea of\nhonoring someone who had addiction issues and was once considered too sexy for\nbroadcast television. \u201cI was appalled to see that a picture of Elvis Presley\nis being considered for a postage stamp,\u201d one person wrote in a letter to the\neditor of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 1992. \u201cThe picture on a postage stamp\nshould be someone or something of historical significance or an individual who\nhas made an extraordinary contribution to the well-being of the human race ...\nIf Presley appears on a stamp, the postmaster general should be fired\nimmediately.\u201d The Postal Service won the day; the Elvis stamp is widely\nconsidered the most popular commemorative stamp in U.S. history. The decision\nto put Bugs Bunny on a stamp was also met with mild indignation. \u201cThat one\nprobably didn\u2019t go over as well with the serious stamp collectors,\u201d says Jay\nBigalke, the editor in chief of Linn\u2019s Stamp News. People used it as an excuse\nto \u201cwrite to the Postal Service and say, \u2018If you can issue a stamp for Bugs\nBunny, you can issue a stamp for fill-in-the-blank.\u2019\u201d\n\nA reason these design choices are so freighted is that they have broad,\ninternational reach. \u201cTrivial as they may seem, [stamps] are objects that are\nextremely dispersed both domestically and abroad, and which allow governments\nto propagate widely the official culture of a given state,\u201d Altman wrote. Said\nanother way, stamps let officials tell the story they want to tell. President\nFranklin D. Roosevelt, a stamp collector himself, \u201cnosed his way into stamp\ndesign, even sketching them out on a napkin and passing it along to the\npostmaster general at the time,\u201d Bigalke told me. After Roosevelt signed the\nNational Industrial Recovery Act, he asked for a stamp promoting the law to be\nissued. \u201cHe just recognized the importance of the postage stamp and conveying\na message,\u201d Bigalke said.\n\nOther countries use their stamps to tell stories too, and sometimes those\nstories are deeply influenced by the United States. A number of African\ncountries have released stamps featuring Martin Luther King Jr., for example,\na testament to King\u2019s international importance and popularity. The Apollo 11\nmission has been featured on more than 50 stamps in other countries. A stamp\nissued by Iran in 1984 featured Malcolm X. American pop culture has also\ninfiltrated international postage stamps. In the Caribbean, St. Vincent and\nthe Grenadines has featured both Elvis and Michael Jackson on its stamps.\n(Jackson has not been featured on an American stamp.)\n\nRead: Stamps for Me (1943)\n\nStamps are also used for more expressly political or propagandist purposes. In\n1969, North Korea issued a stamp called \u201cInternational Conference of\nJournalists Against US Imperialism,\u201d showing several pens attacking President\nRichard Nixon. \u201cThe very fact that [North Korea] uses stamps as a medium to\nattack America is, again, proof [of] the value of stamps,\u201d Morel said.\n\u201cBecause if there was no value, why bother?\u201d\n\nLeft: The Elvis Stamp. Right: A stamp issued by Iran in 1984 featuring Malcolm\nX (top) and a North Korean stamp called \u201cInternational Conference of\nJournalists Against US Imperialism.\u201d (Siqi Li for The Atlantic)\n\nMore recently, Ukraine used its stamp program as a sort of hearts-and-minds\ncampaign. \u201cWhen the invasion and the war broke out, they issued a postage\nstamp showing a soldier flipping off the battleship\u201d off of Snake Island,\nBigalke said. Ukraine has \u201cbeen using stamps as a rallying cry in the country\nin a much more powerful way than any other country really has with their\npostage stamps,\u201d he told me. \u201cA lot of people have bought the stamps to help\nsupport Ukraine.\u201d\n\nStamps have also been used as a sort of bilateral foreign-relations tool. A\nstamp commemorating joint Soviet-American efforts in space exploration was\nreleased in 1975, during the Cold War. And the U.S. and Australia jointly\nreleased stamps celebrating the latter\u2019s bicentenary, in 1988.\n\nPerhaps the most famous American stamp design is one the U.S. Postal Service\nnever wanted to release. In 1918, the department issued its first airmail\nstamp, which featured a Curtiss Jenny biplane. Because of its two-color\ndesign, the stamp had to go through the press twice. And at some point in the\nprinting, one of the plates was turned upside down. This run resulted in nine\nmisprinted 100-stamp sheets. Eight of them were found and destroyed on the\nprinting floor, but one misprinted sheet of the stamp\u2014now known as the\nInverted Jenny\u2014found its way to the public. (In 1939, this magazine referred\nto such misprints as \u201cphilatelic romances.\u201d) The Inverted Jenny has since\nbecome one of the most highly prized stamps for collectors and is a small pop-\nculture phenomenon. It was briefly referenced in the film Brewster\u2019s Millions\nand in a joke at Homer\u2019s expense in The Simpsons. Last year, a single Inverted\nJenny stamp sold for a little more than $2 million.\n\nStamps provide \u201can amazing body of material to study the history of\ncommunication, art, design, but also humanity,\u201d Morel said. And this study\nstarted essentially on the very first day of the modern postage stamp\u2019s\nexistence. The oldest surviving stamp collection dates back to 1855, by a\ncollector from Belgium who started amassing the stamps to learn geography.\n\nIn 1943, in the midst of World War II, The Atlantic published a sort of\ndefense of the hobby in its February issue. \u201cSo stamp collecting. It\u2019s a vice,\nbut most pleasant,\u201d wrote Henry Bellamann, a poet and an author, in the\narticle \u201cStamps for Me.\u201d He later continued, \u201cThe stress of the day in which\nwe are living is unbelievably great. We have need of releases through simple\npleasures.\u201d\n\nSeeing stamps through the prism of history made a recent visit to my local,\nfluorescently lit post office edge just barely into exciting territory. I had\ngone to return a package and thought I might buy some stamps. A gentleman\nahead of me in line asked about the particular design I wanted, and I\noverheard the teller say that it had sold out. So when I returned home, I\ndecided to buy some stamps online. Scrolling through the gallery, I selected\nsome Our Lady of Gu\u00e1pulo holiday stamps (issued 2020) and some Pi\u00f1atas! stamps\n(issued 2023) to attach to invites for a party. I could just send an email\ninvite, but knowing that nearly everyone\u2019s mood lifts when they receive actual\nletters, it only feels right to choose the mailbox over the inbox.\n\nSupported by the British Library Eccles Institute for the Americas Phil Davies\nFellowship.\n\nAndrea Valdez is a managing editor at The Atlantic.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
