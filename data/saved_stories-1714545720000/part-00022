This bill includes the\n\u201cProtecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act\u201d. I\nhaven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about it since.\n\nI started writing this post on Wednesday after hearing the news, but things\ngot busy. I\u2019ve been reading posts and listening to podcasts where people have\nbeen discussing this for several days now. This post is my attempt to try and\nget some of my thoughts on the matter straight.\n\n#### What does the act do?\n\nFirst off: I am definitely not a lawyer and this is not legal advice. This is\njust my read on the act because I was curious about how it worked. I\u2019m also\nnot a US citizen, so please excuse any Canadianisms. That said, the text of\nthe act is fairly short and I found it easy to read. Please let me know if I\u2019m\nmisrepresenting anything.\n\nThe act defines a \u201cforeign adversary controlled application\u201d as an app or\nwebsite where one can make an account, upload content, has more than 1 million\nmonthly active users, and is controlled by a \u201cforeign adversary\u201d of the United\nStates. This category of app isn\u2019t banned by default, but can be banned if the\nPresident of the United States thinks they\u2019re a national security threat. I\nfound it interesting that this also affects source code distribution. Apps\nfocused on \u201cproduct reviews, business reviews, or travel information and\nreviews\u201d are exempt.\n\nThe act specifically calls out ByteDance, any of its subsidiaries/successors,\nand its app/website TikTok as immediately affected by the Act. TikTok, and any\nfuture app affected by this Act, are to be banned from being distributed or\nupdated after 270 days (with a 90 day extension if the President tells\nCongress that things need a bit more time).\n\nThe penalties for distribution after the ban are up to $5,000 USD per user if\nan organization distributes or updates a banned app in the US. There\u2019s also a\nrequirement that apps in the process of being banned must allow US customers\nto export their content. If they don\u2019t, there\u2019s a penalty of up to $500 USD\nper user.\n\nTo get around the ban, an affected company can sell the app. They don\u2019t need\nto sell to a US company, it just needs to be a company that isn\u2019t a foreign\nadversary. Once sold, the previous owner can\u2019t have anything to do with the\nnew one.\n\n#### Security threat\n\nThe rationale behind banning TikTok is that it\u2019s a national security threat.\nThis may be true, but I haven\u2019t heard the best explanation as to why.\n\nSome seem concerned that the app itself could be doing nefarious things on\npeople\u2019s devices. The Chinese government is no stranger to surveillance, so I\nunderstand where this is coming from. But on modern mobile platforms the\nTikTok app, when downloaded from Apple\u2019s App Store or Google Play, is no\ndifferent from any other app in terms of what spying capabilities it has. The\napp still needs to go through app approval on either store, and could be\npulled by Apple or Google if it\u2019s found to be doing anything shady.\n\nTikTok also offers a web app that I\u2019ve used a few times to see content. I\ndon\u2019t have a TikTok account, but I didn\u2019t need to sign up to view content, and\nit\u2019s not doing any more/worse tracking than something like Facebook. By my\nreading of the act above, the web version of TikTok will also be banned in the\nUS.\n\nI\u2019m not going to pretend there\u2019s no difference between companies in the US and\na company in China. But as someone in Canada, I\u2019m also quite concerned about\nthe amount of tracking that companies in the US push on me. China is a foreign\nadversary to the US, so it makes sense that Chinese surveillance of people in\nthe US would be scrutinized. However, I\u2019m not convinced that TikTok is a large\nnational security threat because of tracking. Chinese entities can still\npurchase data from data brokers all over the world. It seems that a bill like\nH.R.7520 - Protecting Americans\u2019 Data from Foreign Adversaries Act of 2024\nmight be a better way to solve the underlying problem.\n\nAnother concern is that TikTok\u2019s algorithms could be influencing its users in\nways that might benefit China. I guess I can see this, but I\u2019m not sure. Could\na Chinese company be told by their government to show divisive or harmful\ncontent to users in the US? Absolutely. Is this actually happening? It\u2019s hard\nto say. Perhaps the danger of it being possible is enough to try and ban the\nservice. If there\u2019s strong evidence for this sort of behaviour, I think it\nwould be helpful for the parties trying to ban TikTok to share some of it.\nMaybe the evidence is so sensitive that they can\u2019t speak about it at all, but\nI find that hard to believe.\n\n#### Forced sale\n\nI keep writing \u201cban\u201d above, but one theme I kept seeing was that this isn\u2019t a\nban. Why, it might even be an opportunity! ByteDance can just sell TikTok and\nthere won\u2019t be an issue anymore. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m from Canada, or maybe\nit\u2019s because I\u2019m not a hyper-effective capitalist, but this line of thinking\nrubs me the wrong way.\n\nLet\u2019s say that there was a large change in the political makeup of the US.\nPerhaps the government started playing really fast and loose with private user\ndata of the companies within its borders. If the Canadian government said that\nMeta had to sell Facebook to a country with a stronger privacy regime or face\na ban, I\u2019d bet we\u2019d be laughed out of the room.\n\nObviously this isn\u2019t a 1-to-1 comparison. Canada is small potatoes compared to\nthe US market. I just feel that some introspection would be helpful here. Not\neveryone is trying to build toward an exit.\n\nI don\u2019t know much about ByteDance as a company, but I\u2019d bet many people\nworking there take pride in building TikTok. While writing this, I learned\nthat ByteDance\u2019s first app, Neihan Duanzi, became very popular in China and\nwas eventually banned by the Chinese government. Does ByteDance have to follow\nthe law in China? Sure. But I don\u2019t think they\u2019re primarily a surveillance or\npropaganda company.\n\nAlso, let\u2019s say the sale goes ahead: who would buy them? The companies with\nthe largest market caps are mainly US tech companies. Would Meta get away with\npurchasing TikTok in the current regulatory environment? Do we want a TikTok\nthat\u2019s owned by a pharmaceutical or financial giant?\n\nNone of this probably matters. Even if ByteDance felt it was fine to sell, the\nChinese government has previously said that it would oppose a forced sale. And\nbecause TikTok is being forced to sell, they\u2019re in a very poor bargaining\nposition.\n\n#### Politics\n\nI think the main reason that divestment is being floated is so the ban is\neasier to swallow. A lot of people in the US use, and love, TikTok. Many have\nmade money, or even a living, on the platform. This has already started to be\na political football in the 2024 US elections.\n\nThe Biden admin has been trying to ban TikTok for over a year, after having\nreversed an executive order from the previous administration. Then president\nTrump rallied hard to ban the app, only to now be saying that he doesn\u2019t want\na ban because it would give Facebook more power. There was also \u201cProject\nTexas\u201d which seems at least ineffective, and at most a boondoggle, in\nhindsight. It\u2019s a giant mess.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear who people will blame if a ban does go through, but I bet there\nwill be more noise made about this in the lead up to November. Likely some of\nthat noise will be made on TikTok itself.\n\n#### Outcomes\n\nOn a great episode of the last week Vergecast, Nilay made the point that there\nare three possible ways this could end:\n\n  * TikTok wins a lawsuit\n  * TikTok sells\n  * TikTok is banned from operating in the US\n\nTikTok has already said that they\u2019re going to head to court and try to prevent\nthe sale or ban on first amendment grounds. I have no idea how that will look,\nbut their odds of winning certainly aren\u2019t zero.\n\nI think the likelihood of TikTok selling, and being purchased by a company\nthat could run the product, is effectively zero. Maybe I\u2019m wrong, but this\nseems like a mess that TikTok doesn\u2019t want, China doesn\u2019t want, and the FTC\nwouldn\u2019t even allow.\n\nI think the most likely outcome is that TikTok will be banned in the US. I\u2019m\njust a bit worried about the precedent this will set.\n\nContent and design \u00a9 2024, Gavin Anderegg \u2014 powered by Jekyll and GitHub Pages\n\nThis website does not use any cookies.
