It operates silently, with minimal\nenergy consumption, for several hours.\n\n## In which fields will l'a\u00e9rOnde be used?\n\nl'a\u00e9rOnde can be utilized in a wide range of applications and missions:\ntourism and leisure; inspection & intervention (e.g., linear constructions,\nrailways, electric cable laying, roof treatments); agriculture (monitoring and\noperations); communications and events (telecom relay, etc.); security (mine\ndetection, natural disaster response). And many more applications yet to be\ndiscovered...\n\n## Under which regulatory framework will l'a\u00e9rOnde be certified?\n\nThe first a\u00e9rOnde is undergoing certification under the class 5 of the French\nultralight (ULM) regulation. Class 5 pertains to aerostats meeting the\nfollowing criteria: a maximum volume of the aerostat of 900 m3, power limited\nto 75kW for single-seater or 90 kW for two-seater. More details on class 5\nhere.\n\n## What will be the environmental impact of l'a\u00e9rOnde?\n\nl'a\u00e9rOnde is characterized by its very low energy consumption, does not emit\nharmful exhaust gases, flights are very quiet, and there is very little\nairflow disturbance compared to the significant air mixing of helicopters.\n\n## What are the advantages of l'a\u00e9rOnde compared to helicopters?\n\nl'a\u00e9rOnde offers an alternative to helicopters for those seeking low\nenvironmental impact, silence, very low energy consumption, long-duration\nmissions, and excellent stationary control.\n\n## Why choose a toroidal shape over the traditional balloon or airship shapes?\n\nThe toroidal shape offers four advantages: it avoids the wind vane effect\nencountered by airships, allows for hangar entry and exit regardless of wind\ndirection, simplifies the manufacturing of the envelope, and enables the\naerostat to be housed in lower-height hangars. Additionally, the toroidal\nshape is very elegant!\n\n## How were the dimensions of the envelope chosen?\n\nThe dimensions of l'a\u00e9rOnde were selected to fit into the class 5 category of\nthe French ultralight regulation, which allows for the safe transport of 2\npeople on board. The outer diameter of the envelope is 15m, and its height is\n4.5m.\n\n## How much weight can l'a\u00e9rOnde lift?\n\nl'a\u00e9rOnde can lift up to 200 Kg at equilibrium and 400 Kg with the assistance\nof the 12 thrusters. Each m3 of Helium can lift 1 Kg of load.\n\n## What will be the unique flight characteristics of l'a\u00e9rOnde?\n\nl'a\u00e9rOnde is already very easy to pilot in three dimensions; piloting\nassistance makes the aircraft perfectly stable and supports/controls the\nmovements. An autopilot mode will allow for stationary holding without pilot\nintervention, even in windy conditions.\n\n## How is flight safety ensured?\n\nContrary to popular belief, an aerostat is naturally secure. Even riddled with\nholes, the envelope can fly for a very long time as the internal gas pressure\nis only about 4 millibars, so it escapes extremely slowly. In most use cases,\nl'a\u00e9rOnde flies with a slight overweight balance, gently bringing it to the\nground in the event of a complete engine failure (similar to hot-air balloon\nflight). We have demonstrated that with just one operational engine out of\nthree, l'a\u00e9rOnde remains controllable.\n\n## Is l'a\u00e9rOnde protected by patents?\n\nl'a\u00e9rOnde's highly innovative design is patent-protected.\n\n## What are the weather limitations for using l'a\u00e9rOnde?\n\nl'a\u00e9rOnde can be used in weather conditions that allow for visual flight in\ngeneral aviation. It can fly in rain and poor visibility, as well as under\nwind gusts of up to 40 km/h.\n\n## What are the speed characteristics of l'a\u00e9rOnde?\n\nWith a payload of 200 kg, the economical cruising speeds of l'a\u00e9rOnde are\naround 20 km/h in all three directions (forward<->backward, up<->down,\nleft<->right). Under these conditions, the autonomy is about 4 hours.\n\n## How are the 12 electric motors of the 3 thrusters powered?\n\nEach of the three directional thrusters has four electric motors. Each motor\nis powered by an INR Lithium Ion battery pack with a total capacity of 8kWh.\nWith a consumption of 1.2 kWh per hour under standard usage conditions,\nl'a\u00e9rOnde has an autonomy of more than 4 hours while maintaining a safety\nreserve.\n\n## Why did you choose INR Lithium Ion batteries?\n\nINR Lithium Ion batteries (lithium manganese nickel) allow us to\nsimultaneously meet safety requirements under our usage conditions, mass\nenergy needs, and available power.\n\n## What is the envelope made of?\n\nThe envelope is made of a special helium-proof fabric that is tear-resistant.\nThe assembly of the different fabrics is achieved through stitching, welding,\nand/or gluing.\n\n## Why choose wireless technology for controlling the thrusters, batteries,\nand ballonets?\n\nThis wireless option (fly by radio) significantly reduces issues related to\nwiring (connection time, possible assembly errors, fires, etc.), lightens\nl'a\u00e9rOnde, and simplifies its maintenance. All communications are protected by\nthe latest encryption techniques to ensure robust control.\n\n## What is the energy cost of an hour of flight?\n\nFor an hour of flight, with a total consumption of around 1.2 kWh, the energy\ncost is less than 1\u20ac, whereas a helicopter used for aerial work consumes about\n200 liters of kerosene.\n\n## Who will be able to pilot l'a\u00e9rOnde?\n\nAs l'a\u00e9rOnde falls into the category of ultralight class 5 airships, the pilot\nwill need to have the corresponding pilot's license. Additional training will\nbe offered by the AERONDE company.\n\n## Where are the a\u00e9rOndes designed and manufactured?\n\nThe a\u00e9rOndes are designed and assembled at the Grenoble le Versoud aerodrome.\nThey will also be tested on this platform.\n\n## How many people are working on l'a\u00e9rOnde?\n\nCurrently, 6 people are working full-time on the project. Additionally, over\n400 INP-Ense3 students have also contributed to the project in previous years.\n\n## Why did you choose this name for your aircraft?\n\nSimply because l'a\u00e9rOnde is an aerostat that is all about roundness!\n\n# Contact\n\nEmail: contact@aeronde.com\n\nA\u00e9ronde\n\nA\u00e9rodrome de Grenoble Le Versoud\n\n38420 Le Versoud\n\nFRANCE\n\n+\u2212\n\nLeaflet | \u00a9 OpenStreetMap contributors\n\n\u00a9 2024 AerOnde.
