For his son, see Fred Hampton Jr.\n\nFred Hampton  \n---  \nHampton speaking at a rally in Grant Park, Chicago, September 1969  \nBorn| Fredrick Allen Hampton(1948-08-30)August 30, 1948Chicago, Illinois, U.S.  \nDied| December 4, 1969(1969-12-04) (aged 21)Chicago, Illinois, U.S.  \nCause of death| Assassination (gunshot wounds)^[1]^[2]^[3]  \nEducation| Triton College  \nOccupation(s)| Activist, revolutionary  \nYears active| 1966\u20131969  \nKnown for| Chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party  \nPolitical party| Black Panther  \nPartner| Akua Njeri  \nChildren| Fred Hampton Jr.  \n  \nFredrick \"Chairman Fred\" Allen Hampton Sr. (August 30, 1948 \u2013 December 4,\n1969) was an American activist. He came to prominence in his late teens and\nvery early 20s in Chicago as deputy chairman of the national Black Panther\nParty and chair of the Illinois chapter. As a progressive African American, he\nfounded the anti-racist, anti-classist Rainbow Coalition,^[4] a prominent\nmulticultural political organization that initially included the Black\nPanthers, Young Patriots (which organized poor whites), and the Young Lords\n(which organized Hispanics), and an alliance among major Chicago street gangs\nto help them end infighting and work for social change. A Marxist\u2013Leninist-\nMaoist,^[5]^[6] Hampton considered fascism the greatest threat, saying,\n\"nothing is more important than stopping fascism, because fascism will stop us\nall.\"^[7]\n\nIn 1967, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) identified Hampton as a\nradical threat. It tried to subvert his activities in Chicago, sowing\ndisinformation among black progressive groups and placing a\ncounterintelligence operative in the local Panthers organization. In December\n1969, Hampton was drugged,^[8]^[9] then shot and killed in his bed during a\npredawn raid at his Chicago apartment by a tactical unit of the Cook County\nState's Attorney's Office, who received aid from the Chicago Police Department\nand the FBI leading up to the attack. Law enforcement sprayed more than 100\ngunshots throughout the apartment; the occupants fired once.^[10] During the\nraid, Panther Mark Clark was also killed and several others were seriously\nwounded. In January 1970, the Cook County Coroner held an inquest; the\ncoroner's jury concluded that Hampton's and Clark's deaths were justifiable\nhomicides.^[11]^[12]^[13]^[14]\n\nA civil lawsuit was later filed on behalf of the survivors and the relatives\nof Hampton and Clark.^[15] It was resolved in 1982 by a settlement of $1.85\nmillion (equivalent to $5.84 million in 2023); the U.S. federal government,\nCook County, and the City of Chicago each paid one-third to a group of nine\nplaintiffs. Given revelations about the illegal COINTELPRO program and\ndocuments associated with the killings, many scholars now consider Hampton's\ndeath, at age 21, a deliberate murder or an assassination at the FBI's\ninitiative.^[1]^[2]^[3]^[16]^[17]\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n### Early life and youth[edit]\n\nHampton in a 1966 yearbook\n\nHampton was born on August 30, 1948, in present-day Summit Argo, Illinois\n(generally shortened to Summit), and moved with his parents to another Chicago\nsuburb, Maywood, at age 10.^[18] His parents had come from Louisiana as part\nof the Great Migration of African Americans in the early 20th century out of\nthe South. They both worked at the Argo Starch Company, a corn starch\nprocessor. As a youth, Hampton was gifted both in the classroom and\nathletically, and hoped to play center field for the New York Yankees.^[19] At\n10 years old, he started hosting weekend breakfasts for other children from\nthe neighborhood, cooking the meals himself in what could be described as a\nprecursor to the Panthers' free breakfast program.^[20] In high school, he led\nwalkouts protesting black students' exclusion from the competition for\nhomecoming queen and calling on officials to hire more black teachers and\nadministrators.^[20] Hampton graduated from Proviso East High School with\nhonors and varsity letters, and a Junior Achievement Award, in 1966.^[21]\n\nIn 1966, Fred Hampton turned 18.^[22] At that time, he started identifying\nwith the Third World socialist struggles, as well as reading communist\nrevolutionaries Che Guevara, Ho Chi Minh, and Mao Zedong.^[22] Shortly after,\nHampton urged not only peace in the Vietnam War, but also North Vietnam's\nvictory.^[22]\n\nHampton became active in the National Association for the Advancement of\nColored People (NAACP) and assumed leadership of its West Suburban Branch's\nYouth Council. In his capacity as an NAACP youth organizer, he demonstrated\nnatural leadership abilities: from a community of 27,000, he was able to\nmuster a youth group of 500 members strong. He worked to get more and better\nrecreational facilities established in the neighborhoods and to improve\neducational resources for Maywood's impoverished black community.\n\n### Activity in Chicago[edit]\n\n> We got to face some facts. That the masses are poor, that the masses belong\n> to what you call the lower class, and when I talk about the masses, I'm\n> talking about the white masses, I'm talking about the black masses, and the\n> brown masses, and the yellow masses, too. We've got to face the fact that\n> some people say you fight fire best with fire, but we say you put fire out\n> best with water. We say you don't fight racism with racism. We're gonna\n> fight racism with solidarity. We say you don't fight capitalism with no\n> black capitalism; you fight capitalism with socialism.\n\n\u2014Fred Hampton on solidarity.^[23]\n\nIn 1968, Hampton was accused of assaulting an ice cream truck driver, stealing\n$71 worth of ice cream bars, and giving them to kids in the street. He was\nconvicted in May 1969 and served time in prison.^[8] In a memoir, Frank B.\nWilderson III places this incident in the context of COINTELPRO efforts to\ndisrupt the Black Panthers of Chicago by the \"leveling of trumped-up\ncharges\".^[17]\n\nIn 1969, Hampton, now deputy chairman of the BPP Illinois chapter, conducted a\nmeeting condemning sexism.^[24] After 1969, the party considered sexism\ncounter-revolutionary.^[25] In 1970, about 40\u201370% of party members were\nwomen.^[26]\n\nOver the next year, Hampton and his friends and associates achieved many\nsuccesses in Chicago. Perhaps the most important was a nonaggression pact\namong Chicago's most powerful street gangs. Emphasizing that racial and ethnic\nconflict among gangs would only keep its members entrenched in poverty,\nHampton strove to forge an anti-racist, class-conscious, multiracial alliance\namong the BPP, the Young Patriots Organization, and the Young Lords under the\nleadership of Jose Cha Cha Jimenez, leading to the Rainbow Coalition.^[27]\n\nHampton met the Young Lords in Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood the day\nafter they were in the news for occupying a police community workshop at the\nChicago 18th District Police Station. He was arrested twice with Jimenez at\nthe Wicker Park Welfare Office, and both were charged with \"mob action\" at a\npeaceful picket of the office. Later, the Rainbow Coalition was joined\nnationwide by Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), the Brown Berets, AIM,\nand the Red Guard Party.^[28]^[29] In May 1969, Hampton called a press\nconference to announce that the coalition had formed. What the coalition\ngroups would do was based on common action. Some of their joint issues were\npoverty, anti-racism, corruption, police brutality, and substandard\nhousing.^[30]^[31] If there was a protest or a demonstration, the groups would\nattend the event and support each other.^[31]^[32]\n\nJeffrey Haas, who was Hampton's lawyer, has praised some of Hampton's politics\nand his success in unifying movements.^[33] But Haas criticizes the way\nHampton and the BPP organized in a pyramidal/vertical structure, contrasting\nthis with the horizontal structure of Black Lives Matter: \"They may also have\npicked up on the vulnerability of a hierarchical movement where you have one\nleader, which makes the movement very vulnerable if that leader is imprisoned,\nkilled, or otherwise compromised. I think the fact that Black Lives Matter\nsays 'We're leaderfull, not leaderless' perhaps makes them less vulnerable to\nthis kind of government assault.\"^[33]\n\nHampton and Benjamin Spock (right) at a protest rally outside the Everett\nMcKinley Dirksen U.S. Courthouse in Chicago, October 1969\n\nHampton rose quickly in the Black Panthers based on his organizing skills,\noratorical gifts, and charisma. Once he became leader of the Chicago chapter,\nhe organized weekly rallies, participated in strikes, worked closely with the\nBPP's local People's Clinic, taught political education classes every morning\nat 6 am, and launched a project for community supervision of the police.\nHampton was also instrumental in the BPP's Free Breakfast Program. When Bob\nBrown left the party with Kwame Ture, in the FBI-fomented SNCC/Panther split,\nHampton assumed chairmanship of the Illinois state BPP. This automatically\nmade him a national BPP deputy chairman. As the FBI's COINTELPRO began to\ndecimate the nationwide Panther leadership, Hampton's prominence in the\nnational hierarchy increased rapidly and dramatically. Eventually, he was in\nline to be appointed to the party's Central Committee Chief of Staff. He would\nhave achieved this position had he not been killed.^[28]^[29]\n\n### FBI investigation[edit]\n\nThe FBI believed that Hampton's leadership and talent for communication made\nhim a major threat among Black Panther leaders. It began keeping close tabs on\nhis activities. Investigations have shown that FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover\nwas determined to prevent the formation of a cohesive Black movement in the\nUnited States. Hoover believed the Panthers, Young Patriots, Young Lords, and\nsimilar radical coalitions that Hampton forged in Chicago were a stepping\nstone to the rise of a revolution that could cause a radical change in the\nU.S. government.^[34]\n\nThe FBI opened a file on Hampton in 1967. It tapped Hampton's mother's phone\nin February 1968 and by May placed Hampton on the bureau's \"Agitator Index\" as\na \"key militant leader\".^[28] In late 1968, the Racial Matters squad of the\nFBI's Chicago field office recruited William O'Neal to work with it; he had\nrecently been arrested twice for interstate car theft and impersonating a\nfederal officer. In exchange for having his felony charges dropped and\nreceiving a monthly stipend, O'Neal agreed to infiltrate the BPP as a\ncounterintelligence operative.^[35]\n\nO'Neal joined the party and quickly rose in the organization, becoming\nDirector of Chapter Security and Hampton's bodyguard. In 1969, the FBI Special\nAgent in Charge (SAC) in San Francisco wrote Hoover that the agent's\ninvestigation had found that, in his city at least, the Panthers were\nprimarily feeding breakfast to children. Hoover responded with a memo implying\nthat the agent's career prospects depended on his supplying evidence to\nsupport Hoover's view that the BPP was \"a violence-prone organization seeking\nto overthrow the Government by revolutionary means\".^[36]\n\nUsing anonymous letters, the FBI sowed distrust and eventually instigated a\nsplit between the Panthers and the Blackstone Rangers. O'Neal instigated an\narmed clash between them on April 2, 1969. The Panthers became effectively\nisolated from their power base in the Chicago ghetto, so the FBI worked to\nundermine its ties with other radical organizations. O'Neal was instructed to\n\"create a rift\" between the party and Students for a Democratic Society, whose\nChicago headquarters was near that of the Panthers.\n\nThe FBI released a batch of racist cartoons in the Panthers' name,^[37] aimed\nat alienating white activists. It also launched a disinformation program to\nforestall the formation of the Rainbow Coalition, but the BPP did make an\nalliance with the Young Patriots and Young Lords. In repeated directives,\nHoover demanded that COINTELPRO personnel investigate the Rainbow Coalition,\n\"destroy what the [BPP] stands for\", and \"eradicate its 'serve the people'\nprograms\".^[38]\n\nDocuments secured by Senate investigators in the early 1970s revealed that the\nFBI actively encouraged violence between the Panthers and other radical\ngroups; this provoked multiple murders in cities throughout the country.^[39]\nOn July 16, 1969, an armed confrontation between party members and the Chicago\nPolice Department resulted in one BPP member being mortally wounded, and six\nothers arrested on serious charges.\n\nIn early October, Hampton and his girlfriend Deborah Johnson (now known as\nAkua Njeri), who was pregnant with their child (Fred Hampton Jr.), rented a\nfour-and-a-half-room apartment at 2337 West Monroe Street to be closer to BPP\nheadquarters. O'Neal reported to his superiors that much of the Panthers'\n\"provocative\" arms stockpile was stored there. He drew them a map of the\napartment. In early November, Hampton traveled to California on a speaking\nengagement with the UCLA Law Students Association. He met with the remaining\nBPP national hierarchy, who appointed him to the party's central committee. He\nwas soon to take the position of chief of staff and major spokesman.^[40]\n\n## Assassination[edit]\n\n### Prelude[edit]\n\nOn the night of November 13, 1969, while Hampton was in California, Chicago\npolice officers John J. Gilhooly and Frank G. Rappaport were killed in a gun\nbattle with Panthers; one died the next day.^[41] A total of nine police\nofficers were shot. Spurgeon Winter Jr, a 19-year-old Panther, was killed by\npolice. Another Panther, Lawrence S. Bell, was charged with murder. In an\nunsigned editorial headlined \"No Quarter for Wild Beasts\", the Chicago Tribune\nurged that Chicago police officers approaching suspected Panthers \"should be\nordered to be ready to shoot.\"^[42]\n\nAs part of the larger COINTELPRO operation, the FBI was determined to prevent\nany improvement in the effectiveness of the BPP leadership.^[43] The FBI\norchestrated an armed raid with the Chicago police and Cook County State's\nAttorney on Hampton's Chicago apartment. They had obtained detailed\ninformation about the apartment, including a layout of furniture, from O'Neal.\nAn augmented, 14-man team of the SAO (state Special Prosecutions Unit) was\norganized for a predawn raid; they were armed with a search warrant for\nillegal weapons.^[28]^[29]\n\nOn the evening of December 3, Hampton taught a political education course at a\nlocal church, which was attended by most Panther members. Afterward, as was\ntypical, he was accompanied to his Monroe Street apartment by Johnson and\nseveral Panthers: Blair Anderson, James Grady, Ronald \"Doc\" Satchell, Harold\nBell, Verlina Brewer, Louis Truelock, Brenda Harris and Mark Clark. O'Neal was\nalready there, having prepared a late dinner, which the group ate around\nmidnight. O'Neal had slipped the secobarbital into a drink that Hampton\nconsumed during the dinner to sedate Hampton so he would not awaken during the\nsubsequent raid. O'Neal left after dinner. At about 1:30 am, December 4,\nHampton fell asleep mid-sentence while talking to his mother on the\ntelephone.^[44]^[45]^[46]^[47]\n\nAlthough Hampton was not known to take drugs, Cook County chemist Eleanor\nBerman later reported that she had run two tests, each showing evidence of\nbarbiturates in Hampton's blood. An FBI chemist failed to find similar traces,\nbut Berman stood by her findings.^[48]\n\n### Raid[edit]\n\nSite of Black Panther Party Raid, Fred Hampton's DeathThe bed and room where\nHampton was fatally shot during the raid, showing a large amount of blood on\nhis side of the mattress and numerous bullet holes in the walls.\n\nThe office of Cook County State's Attorney Edward Hanrahan organized the raid,\nusing officers attached to his office.^[49] Hampton had recently strongly\ncriticized Hanrahan, saying that Hanrahan's talk about a \"war on gangs\" was\nreally rhetoric used to enable him to carry out a \"war on black youth\".^[50]\n\nAt 4 am, the heavily armed police team arrived at the site, divided into two\nteams, eight for the front of the building and six for the rear. At 4:45 am,\nthey stormed the apartment. Mark Clark, sitting in the front room of the\napartment with a shotgun in his lap, was on security duty. The police shot him\nin the chest, killing him instantly.^[51] An alternative account said that\nClark answered the door and police immediately shot him. Either way, Clark's\ngun discharged once into the ceiling.^[52] This single round was fired when he\nsuffered a reflexive death-convulsion after being shot.^[53] This was the only\nshot fired by the Panthers.^[29]^[54]^[55]^[40]\n\nHampton, drugged by barbiturates, was sleeping on a mattress in the bedroom\nwith Johnson, who was nine months pregnant with their child.^[51]^[40] Police\nofficers removed her from the room while Hampton lay unconscious in bed.^[56]\nThen the raiding team fired at the head of the south bedroom. Hampton was\nwounded in the shoulder by the shooting.^[40] According to the National\nArchives and Records Administration, \"upon that discovery, an officer shot him\ntwice in his head and killed him\".^[40]\n\nFellow Black Panther Harold Bell said that he heard the following\nexchange:^[57]\n\n> \"That's Fred Hampton.\"\n>\n> \"Is he dead?... Bring him out.\"\n>\n> \"He's barely alive.\"\n>\n> \"He'll make it.\"\n\nThe injured Panthers said they heard two shots. According to Hampton's\nsupporters, the shots were fired point-blank at Hampton's head.^[58] According\nto Johnson, an officer then said: \"He's good and dead now.\"^[57]\n\nChicago police removing Hampton's body\n\nHampton's body was dragged into the bedroom doorway and left in a pool of\nblood. The officers directed their gunfire at the remaining Panthers who had\nbeen sleeping in the north bedroom (Satchel, Anderson, Brewer, and\nHarris).^[51] Brewer, Satchel, Anderson, and Harris were seriously\nwounded,^[51] then beaten and dragged into the street. They were arrested on\ncharges of aggravated assault and attempted murder of the officers. They were\neach held on $100,000 bail.^[52]\n\nIn the early 1990s, Jose \"Cha Cha\" Jimenez, a former president and co-founder\nof the Young Lords who had developed close ties to Hampton and the Chicago\nBlack Panther Party during the late 1960s, interviewed Johnson about the raid.\nShe said:\n\n    I believe Fred Hampton was drugged. The reason why is because when he woke up when the person [Truelock] said, \"Chairman, chairman,\" he was shaking Fred's arm, you know, Fred's arm was folded across the head of the bed. And Fred\u2014he just raised his head up real slow. It was like watching a slow motion. He raised. His eyes were open. He raised his head up real slow, you know, with his eyes toward the entranceway, toward the bedroom and laid his head back down. That was the only movement he made [...]^[56]\n\nThe seven Panthers who survived the raid were indicted by a grand jury on\ncharges of attempted murder, armed violence, and other weapons charges. These\ncharges were subsequently dropped. During the trial, the Chicago Police\nDepartment claimed that the Panthers were the first to fire shots, but a later\ninvestigation found that the Chicago police fired between 90 and 99 shots,\nwhile the only Panthers shot was from Clark's dropped shotgun.^[52]^[59]\n\nAfter the raid, the apartment was left unguarded. The Panthers sent some\nmembers to investigate, accompanied by videographer Mike Gray and stills\nphotographer Norris McNamara to document the scene. This footage was\ninstrumental in proving the raid was an assassination. The footage was later\nreleased as part of the 1971 documentary The Murder of Fred Hampton. After a\nbreak-in at an FBI office in Pennsylvania, the existence of COINTELPRO, an\nillegal counter-intelligence program, was revealed and reported. With this\nprogram revealed, many activists and others began to suspect that the police\nraid and Hampton's killing were conducted under this program. One of the\ndocuments released after the break-in was a floor plan of Hampton's apartment.\nAnother document outlined a deal that the FBI brokered with US deputy attorney\ngeneral Richard Kleindienst to conceal the FBI's role in Hampton's death and\nthe existence of COINTELPRO.^[59]\n\n### Aftermath[edit]\n\nMourners passing the bier of Hampton. His funeral in December was attended by\nover 5,000 people.\n\nAt a press conference the next day, the police announced the arrest team had\nbeen attacked by the \"violent\" and \"extremely vicious\" Panthers and defended\nthemselves accordingly.^[60] In a second press conference on December 8, the\npolice leadership praised the assault team for their \"remarkable restraint\",\n\"bravery\", and \"professional discipline\" in not killing all the Panthers\npresent. Photographic evidence was presented of \"bullet holes\" allegedly made\nby shots fired by the Panthers, but reporters soon challenged this claim.^[61]\nAn internal investigation was undertaken, and the police claimed that their\ncolleagues on the assault team were exonerated of any wrongdoing, concluding\nthat they \"used lawful means to overcome the assault\".^[62]\n\nFive thousand people attended Hampton's funeral. He was eulogized by black\nleaders, including Jesse Jackson and Ralph Abernathy, Martin Luther King Jr.'s\nsuccessor as head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. In his\neulogy, Jackson said that \"when Fred was shot in Chicago, black people in\nparticular, and decent people in general, bled everywhere.\"^[63] On December\n6, members of the Weather Underground destroyed numerous police vehicles in a\nretaliatory bombing spree at 3600 N. Halsted Street, Chicago.^[64]\n\nThe police called their raid on Hampton's apartment a \"shootout\". The Black\nPanthers called it a \"shoot-in\", because so many shots were fired by\npolice.^[65]^[66]\n\nOn December 11 and 12, the two competing daily newspapers, the Chicago Tribune\nand the Chicago Sun-Times, published vivid accounts of the events but drew\ndifferent conclusions. The Tribune has long been considered the politically\nconservative newspaper, and the Sun-Times the liberal paper.^[67] On December\n11, the Tribune published a page 1 article titled, \"Exclusive \u2013 Hanrahan,\nPolice Tell Panther Story.\" The article included photographs supplied by\nHanrahan's office that depicted bullet holes in a thin white curtain and door\njamb as evidence that the Panthers fired multiple bullets at the\npolice.^[68]^[69]\n\nJack Challem, editor of the Wright College News, the student newspaper at\nWright Junior College in Chicago, had visited the apartment on December 6,\nwhen it was still unsecured. He took numerous photographs of the crime scenes.\nA member of the Black Panthers was allowing visitors to tour the apartment.\nChallem's photographs did not show the bullet holes reported by the Tribune.\nOn the morning of December 12, after the Tribune article had appeared with the\nHanrahan-supplied photos, Challem contacted a reporter at the Sun-Times,\nshowed him his own photographs, and encouraged the other reporter to visit the\napartment. That evening, the Sun-Times published a page 1 article with the\nheadline: \"Those 'bullet holes' aren't.\" According to the article, the alleged\nbullet holes (supposedly the result of the Panthers shooting in the direction\nof the police) were nail heads.^[70]\n\nFour weeks after witnessing Hampton's death at the hands of the police,\nJohnson gave birth to their son, Fred Hampton Jr.^[71]\n\nCivil rights activists Roy Wilkins and Ramsey Clark, styled as \"The Commission\nof Inquiry into the Black Panthers and the Police\", alleged that the Chicago\npolice had killed Hampton without justification or provocation and had\nviolated the Panthers' constitutional rights against unreasonable search and\nseizure.^[72] \"The Commission\" further alleged that the Chicago Police\nDepartment had imposed a summary punishment on the Panthers.^[73]\n\nA federal grand jury did not return any indictment against any of the\nindividuals involved with the planning or execution of the raid, including the\nofficers involved in killing Hampton.^[74] O'Neal, who had given the FBI the\nfloor plan of the apartment and drugged Hampton, later admitted his\ninvolvement in setting up the raid.^[75] He committed suicide on January 15,\n1990.^[48]^[76]\n\n#### Inquest[edit]\n\nShortly after the raid, Cook County Coroner Andrew Toman began forming a\nspecial six-member coroner's jury to hold an inquest into the deaths of\nHampton and Clark.^[77] On December 23, Toman announced four additions to the\njury, who included two African-American men: physician Theodore K. Lawless and\nattorney Julian B. Wilkins, the son of J. Ernest Wilkins Sr.^[77] He said the\nfour were selected from a group of candidates submitted to his office by\ngroups and individuals representing both Chicago's black and white\ncommunities.^[77] Civil rights leaders and spokesmen for the black community\nwere reportedly disappointed with the selection.^[78]\n\nAn official with the Chicago Urban League said, \"I would have had more\nconfidence in the jury if one of them had been a black man who has a rapport\nwith the young and the grass roots in the community.\"^[78] Gus Savage said\nthat such a man to whom the community could relate need not be black.^[78] The\njury eventually included a third black man, who had been a member of the first\ncoroner's jury sworn in on December 4.^[12]\n\nThe blue-ribbon panel convened for the inquest on January 6, 1970. On January\n21, they ruled the deaths of Hampton and Clark to be justifiable\nhomicides.^[12]^[11]^[13]^[14] The jury qualified their verdict on Hampton's\ndeath as \"based solely and exclusively on the evidence presented to this\ninquisition\";^[12] police and expert witnesses provided the only testimony\nduring the inquest.^[79]\n\nJury foreman James T. Hicks stated that they could not consider the charges\nmade by surviving Black Panthers who had been in the apartment; they had told\nreporters that the police had entered the apartment shooting. The survivors\nwere reported to have refused to testify during the inquest because they faced\ncriminal charges of attempted murder and aggravated assault during the\nraid.^[79] Attorneys for the Hampton and Clark families did not introduce any\nwitnesses during the proceedings but called the inquest \"a well-rehearsed\ntheatrical performance designed to vindicate the police officers\".^[12]\nHanrahan said the verdict was recognition \"of the truthfulness of our police\nofficers' account of the events\".^[12]\n\n#### Federal grand jury[edit]\n\nReleased on May 15, 1970, the reports of a federal grand jury criticized the\nactions of the police, the surviving Black Panthers, and the Chicago news\nmedia.^[80]^[81] The grand jury called the police department's raid \"ill\nconceived\" and said many errors were committed during the post-raid\ninvestigation and reconstruction of the events. It said that the surviving\nBlack Panthers' refusal to cooperate hampered the investigation, and that the\npress \"improperly and grossly exaggerated stories\".^[80]^[81]\n\n#### 1970 civil rights lawsuit[edit]\n\nIn 1970, the survivors and relatives of Hampton and Clark filed a civil suit,\nstating that the civil rights of the Black Panther members were violated by\nthe joint police/FBI raid and seeking $47.7 million in damages.^[82] Twenty-\neight defendants were named, including Hanrahan as well as the City of\nChicago, Cook County, and federal governments.^[82] It took years for the case\nto get to trial, which lasted 18 months. It was reported to have been the\nlongest federal trial up to that time.^[82] After its conclusion in 1977,\nJudge Joseph Sam Perry of the United States District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of Illinois dismissed the suit against 21 of the defendants before\njury deliberations.^[82] After jurors deadlocked on a verdict, Perry dismissed\nthe suit against the remaining defendants.^[82]\n\nThe plaintiffs appealed. In 1979, the United States Court of Appeals for the\nSeventh Circuit in Chicago found that the government had withheld relevant\ndocuments, thereby obstructing the judicial process.^[82] Reinstating the case\nagainst 24 of the defendants, the Court of Appeals ordered a new trial.^[82]\nThe Supreme Court of the United States heard an appeal by defendants but voted\n5\u20133 in 1980 to remand the case to the District Court for a new trial.^[82]\n\nIn 1982, the City of Chicago, Cook County, and the federal government agreed\nto a settlement in which each would pay $616,333 (equivalent to $1.95 million\nper payee in 2023) to a group of nine plaintiffs, including the mothers of\nHampton and Clark.^[82] The $1.85 million settlement (equivalent to $5.84\nmillion in 2023) was believed to be the largest ever in a civil rights\ncase.^[82] G. Flint Taylor, one of the attorneys representing the plaintiffs,\nsaid, \"The settlement is an admission of the conspiracy that existed between\nthe FBI and Hanrahan's men to murder Fred Hampton.\"^[83] Assistant United\nStates Attorney Robert Gruenberg said the settlement was intended to avoid\nanother costly trial and was not an admission of guilt or responsibility by\nany of the defendants.^[83]\n\n#### Controversy[edit]\n\nTen days afterward, Bobby Rush, the then deputy minister of defense for the\nIllinois Black Panther Party, called the raiding party an \"execution\nsquad\".^[84] As is typical in settlements, the three government defendants did\nnot acknowledge claims of responsibility for plaintiffs' allegations.\n\nMichael Newton is among the writers who have concluded that Hampton was\nassassinated.^[85] In his 2016 book Unsolved Civil Rights Murder Cases,\n1934\u20131970, Newton writes that Hampton \"was murdered in his sleep by Chicago\npolice with FBI collusion.\"^[86] This view is also presented in Jakobi\nWilliams's book From the Bullet to the Ballot: The Illinois Chapter of the\nBlack Panther Party and Racial Coalition Politics in Chicago.^[87]\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\nHampton was very close with Chicago Black Catholic priest George Clements, who\nserved as his mentor and as a chaplain for the local Panther chapter. Hampton\nand the Panthers also used Clements's parish, Holy Angels Catholic Church in\nChicago (now the parish of Our Lady of Africa^[88]), as a refuge in times of\nparticular surveillance or pursuit from the police. They also provided\nsecurity for several of Clements's \"Black Unity Masses\", part of his\nrevolutionary activities during the Black Catholic Movement. Clements spoke at\nHampton's funeral, and also said a Requiem Mass for him at Holy\nAngels.^[89]^[90]^[91]\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n### Legal and political effects[edit]\n\nAccording to a 2007 Chicago Tribune report, \"The raid ended the promising\npolitical career of Cook County State's Atty. Edward V. Hanrahan, who was\nindicted but cleared with 13 other law-enforcement agents on charges of\nobstructing justice. Bernard Carey, a Republican, defeated him in the next\nelection, in part because of the support of outraged black voters.\"^[92] The\nfamilies of Hampton and Clark filed a $47.7 million civil suit against the\ncity, state, and federal governments. The case went to trial before Federal\nJudge J. Sam Perry. After more than 18 months of testimony and at the close of\nthe plaintiff's case, Perry dismissed the case. The plaintiffs appealed, and\nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, ordering the case\nto be retried. More than a decade after the case had been filed, the suit was\nfinally settled for $1.85 million.^[74] The two families each shared in the\nsettlement.^[93]\n\nJeffrey Haas, with his law partners G. Flint Taylor and Dennis Cunningham and\nattorney James D. Montgomery, were the attorneys for the plaintiffs in the\nfederal suit Hampton v. Hanrahan, conducted additional research and wrote a\nbook about these events. It was published in 2009. He said that Chicago was\nworse off without Hampton:\n\n> Of course, there's also the legacy that, without a young leader, I think the\n> West Side of Chicago degenerated a lot into drugs. And without leaders like\n> Fred Hampton, I think the gangs and the drugs became much more prevalent on\n> the West Side. He was an alternative to that. He talked about serving the\n> community, talked about breakfast programs, educating the people, community\n> control of police. So I think that that's unfortunately another legacy of\n> Fred's murder.^[66]\n\nIn 1990, the Chicago City Council unanimously passed a resolution, introduced\nby then-Alderman Madeline Haithcock, commemorating December 4, 2004, as Fred\nHampton Day in Chicago. The resolution read in part:\n\n> \"Fred Hampton, who was only 21 years old, made his mark in Chicago history\n> not so much by his death as by the heroic efforts of his life and by his\n> goals of empowering the most oppressed sector of Chicago's Black community,\n> bringing people into political life through participation in their own\n> freedom fighting organization.\"^[94]\n\n### Monuments and streets[edit]\n\n  * A public pool was named in his honor in his hometown of Maywood, Illinois.^[95]\n  * On September 7, 2007, a bust of Hampton by sculptor Preston Jackson was erected outside the Fred Hampton Family Aquatic Center in Maywood.^[96]\n  * In March 2006, supporters of Hampton's charity work proposed the naming of a Chicago street in his honor. Chicago's chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police opposed this effort.^[97]\n  * On April 19, 2022 the Village Board of Maywood designated Hampton's childhood home as a historical landmark.^[98]\n\n### Weather Underground reaction[edit]\n\nTwo days after the killings of Hampton and Clark, on December 6, 1969, members\nof the Weathermen destroyed numerous police vehicles in a retaliatory bombing\nspree at 3600 N. Halsted Street in Chicago.^[99] After that, the group became\nmore radical. On May 21, 1970, the group issued a \"Declaration of War\" against\nthe U.S. government and, for the first time, used its new name, the \"Weather\nUnderground Organization\". They adopted fake identities and decided to pursue\ncovert activities only. These initially included preparations to bomb a U.S.\nmilitary non-commissioned officers' dance at Fort Dix, New Jersey, in what\nBrian Flanagan later said was intended to be \"the most horrific hit the United\nStates government had ever suffered on its territory\".^[100]\n\n> \"We've known that our job is to lead white kids into armed revolution...\n> Kids know the lines are drawn: revolution is touching all of our lives. Tens\n> of thousands have learned that protest and marches don't do it.\n> Revolutionary violence is the only way.\" \u2014Bernardine Dohrn^[101]\n\n### Media and popular culture[edit]\n\n#### In film[edit]\n\nA 27-minute documentary, Death of a Black Panther: The Fred Hampton\nStory,^[102] was used as evidence in the civil suit.^[103] The 2002\ndocumentary The Weather Underground shows in detail how that group was deeply\ninfluenced by Hampton and his death\u2014as well as showing that Hampton kept his\ndistance from them for being what he called \"adventuristic, masochistic and\nCusteristic\".^[104]\n\nMuch of the first half of Eyes on the Prize episode 12, \"A Nation of Law?\",\nchronicles Hampton's leadership and extrajudicial killing. The events of his\nrise to prominence, Hoover's targeting of him, and Hampton's subsequent death\nare also recounted with footage in the 2015 documentary The Black Panthers:\nVanguard of the Revolution.\n\nThe Murder of Fred Hampton is a documentary shot from within the movement,\nreleased in 1971. It has no narration, relying solely on footage shot from\nwithin the Black Panther organization and portraying Hampton and his\ncolleagues on their own terms.\n\nIn the 1999 TV miniseries The 60s, Hampton appears serving free breakfast with\nthe BPP. David Alan Grier plays Hampton.^[105]\n\nThe Trial of the Chicago 7 (2020) features Kelvin Harrison Jr. as Hampton, in\nwhich he advises Bobby Seale as he was denied counsel, with the Chicago\nSeven.^[106]^[107]^[108]\n\nJudas and the Black Messiah is a 2021 film about O'Neal's betrayal of Hampton.\nThe film stars Daniel Kaluuya as Hampton and was directed by Shaka King. It\npremiered at the Sundance Film Festival on February 1, 2021. For his\nperformance, Kaluuya won the Academy Award for Best Supporting\nActor.^[109]^[110]\n\n#### In literature[edit]\n\n  * Jeffrey Haas wrote an account of Hampton's death, The Assassination of Fred Hampton: How the FBI and the Chicago Police Murdered a Black Panther (2009).^[111]\n  * Stephen King refers to Hampton in the novel 11/22/63 (2012), in which a character discusses the ripple effect of traveling back in time to prevent John F. Kennedy's assassination. He postulates that other events would follow that could have prevented Hampton's assassination as well.^[112]\n\n#### In music[edit]\n\n  * In his song Murder to Excellence, American rapper and entrepreneur Jay-Z referred to being born on the same day Hampton was murdered.^[113] Hampton's son condemned Jay-Z for doing so.^[114]\n  * American rock band Rage Against the Machine referenced Hampton in its 1996 song Down Rodeo, saying, \"They ain't gonna send us campin' like they did my man Fred Hampton.\"^[115]\n  * Kendrick Lamar refers to Hampton in his song HiiiPoWeR, which also contains references to black civil rights activists Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, and Huey Newton.^[116]\n  * Artists SEIITH and Kiko King referenced Hampton in their 2020 song \"Ghost of Fred Hampton\".^[117]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * List of homicides in Illinois\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Stubblefield, Anna (May 31, 2018).
