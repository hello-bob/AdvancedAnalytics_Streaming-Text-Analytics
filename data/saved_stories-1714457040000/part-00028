It pushed security teams to\nunderstand the attack surface they were protecting, why an accurate inventory\nof IT assets mattered and the importance of being able to locate endpoints\nfast.\n\nHeartbleed was discovered on April 1, 2014. A patch was released seven days\nlater. The bug was present in some versions of the ubiquitous OpenSSL\ncryptographic software library, was given the CVE number 2014-0160 and a \"high\nrisk\" CVSS score of 7.5.\n\n## Heartbleed\u2019s impact: Immediate\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to the resource website Heartbleed.com, set up by Synopsys, a\nsuccessful exploit of the vulnerability allows anyone on the internet to read\nthe memory of the systems protected by the vulnerable versions of the OpenSSL\nsoftware. It would also allow for the compromise of secret keys used to\nidentify the service providers and to encrypt the traffic, the names and\npasswords of the users and the actual content.\n\nThis would allow an attacker to eavesdrop on communications, steal data\ndirectly from the services and users and to impersonate services and users.\n\nThe impact of Heartbleed saw the Canadian government temporarily shut down\nonline services of several government departments, although an attacker\nmanaged to steal around 900 Social Insurance Numbers by exploiting Heartbleed.\nAlso, the Tor Project found some relay servers were still susceptible to the\nHeartbleed bug weeks after the patches were released.\n\nDespite the undisputed destruction and massive heartburn to the wider business\ncommunity, Heartbleed had a sliver of a silver lining that should not be\nforgotten.\n\n## Give it some credit\n\nTen years on from its disclosure, does Heartbleed deserve more credit than it\nreceived for the impact it had upon cybersecurity? Yes, the Window for\nexposure was small, but its potential for exploit was huge. Let\u2019s consider\nsome of the points that cybersecurity has gained from April 2014:\n\n  * We are now looking at remote servers more closely, and keeping those servers patched.\n  * We now understand the issue of visibility of remotely deployed servers.\n  * We understand the vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and problems of open-source code libraries.\n  * How a marketing campaign and logo could be created around a vulnerability.\n\nAccording to Heartbleed.com, the bug was initially introduced to OpenSSL in\nDecember 2011, and was in the wild from 14th March 2012. However, its\ndisclosure on April 1, 2014, showed how reliant we had become on the internet,\nsays Neil Thacker, CISO of Netskope.\n\n\u201cThere was so much reliance on the internet around that time, in 2014, when\nHeartbleed became a publicly known vulnerability, and 10 years previously\nthere would have been less reliance on it for business and commerce,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI think this was a wakeup call to realize the internet was fragile, and we\nfound out OpenSSL had one person working on it full time, to keep it secure\nand keep it updated.\u201d\n\nThacker says Heartbleed also proved the need to put more focus on securing\nwidely used systems, as even though other vulnerabilities have followed \u2014 such\nas Shellshock, Bash and Log4Shell \u2014 but he says there should have been a\nrealization from Heartbleed that we should be doing more about this.\n\n\u201cThere has been a huge increase in vulnerabilities in open source, and in\nproprietary software, but I think Heartbleed was one that probably scared\npeople the most in that point in time.\u201d\n\n## The discovery\n\nThe bug was officially discovered by two entities: Neel Mehta from Google\nSecurity, and by researchers from the Finnish cybersecurity company\nCodenomicon, now part of Synopsys.\n\nMark Van Elderen, who was with Codenomicon at the time of the acquisition, and\nnow serves as director of strategic communications at Synopsys, says a lot of\nthe popularity of Heartbleed comes down to the image of the bug, specifically\nwith its logo, saying it became a household name for security experts:\n\nHe also makes the significant point that so many vulnerabilities require\nfactors for exploitation: physical access, the victim to be running a specific\nsoftware version, \u201cbut Heartbleed was exploitable by default and trivial to\nexploit, and required no extra piece to trigger the vulnerability.\u201d\n\nAsked if he felt that there were positive elements to Heartbleed\u2019s discovery\nand legacy, Van Elderen says Heartbleed was a \u201cwake up call for a lot of\npeople\u201d, and not just administrators and CISOs, but as open source software is\neverywhere \u201cwe need visibility into code in IT and software and asset\ninventory, and how to proactively manage risk in the organisation.\u201d\n\n## Who is on top?\n\nPhil Odence, general manager of the Black Duck Audit Business at Synosys, says\nthose businesses who were on top of their vulnerability and exploit management\nwere able to deal with Heartbleed.\n\n\u201dThe big problem is not the existence of vulnerabilities, as they get patched,\nbut not patching them,\u201d Odence says, pointing at Synopsys\u2019 studies which found\n10% of the applications tested included the Heartbleed vulnerability. By 2018\nthis had reduced to four percent of applications containing the vulnerability,\n\u201cand 2019 was the first year that we didn\u2019t see Heartbleed in any code bases.\u201d\n\nOdence claims that before the disclosure of Heartbleed, \u201ccompanies were not\nthat good at knowing what open source was being used\u201d with Van Elderen saying\nthat in the case of an open source bug, \u201cthe onus is on the consumer to fix\nit, and pretty much anyone running a web server can download a patch and new\nversion of the component \u2014 but that is one of the challenges of open source\nrisk, and if you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re running an open source component it is\nhard to fix what you don\u2019t know exists.\u201d\n\n## Are things better?\n\nIn conclusion, are we in an overall better position than we were 10 years ago\nif a similar vulnerability were to be found? Van Elderen says instances like\nHeartbleed, the Equifax breach and Log4Shell have raised awareness on open-\nsource risk management, and the importance of updating and patching open\nsource.\n\n\u201cWe have become more reactive and responsive and that is not an easy\nchallenge: if it was easy not talking about it, but major branded vulns like\nHeartbleed raise an important level of awareness for organisations, and see\nbusinesses get better at it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt will never completely go away, but\nwe are definitely getting better.\u201d\n\nOdence says there is more use of open source, but also a trend of companies\ntracking what they are using. He says in 2014, 30% of the typical code base\nwas open source, but now that is closer to 75%, and made up of modern\nlanguages like JavaScript.\n\n\u201cThe typical open-source code base we look at will have multiple, hundreds of\ncode bases in it, and that is a lot more to track and manage, so big outbreaks\nare going to be easier to manage,\u201d Odence says. \u201cIf you\u2019re using 500 open\nsource components and know 90% of what you\u2019re using, you still have 50\ncomponents you don't know about, and within there is going to be\nvulnerabilities.\n\n(This article was originally published on SC Media's sister site SC Media UK,\na CyberRisk Alliance resource serving the UK and the greater European security\ncommunity.)\n\nDan Raywood\n\nDan Raywood is a Senior Editor with SC Media UK.
