Interface Allows Computer Access via\nGraphics Card\n\n04/15/2024 | TU Graz news | Research\n\nBy Falko Schoklitsch\n\n## Researchers at TU Graz were successful with three different side-channel\nattacks on graphics cards via the WebGPU browser interface. The attacks were\nfast enough to succeed during normal surfing behaviour.\n\nThe WebGPU interface enables side-channel attacks via the graphics card. Image\nsource: Lunghammer - TU Graz\n\nModern websites place ever greater demands on the computing power of\ncomputers. For this reason, web browsers have also had access to the computing\ncapacities of the graphics card (Graphics Processing Unit or GPU) in addition\nto the CPU of a computer for a number of years. The scripting language\nJavaScript can utilise the resources of the GPU via programming interfaces\nsuch as WebGL and the new WebGPU standard. However, this harbours risks. Using\na website with malicious JavaScript, researchers from the Institute of Applied\nInformation Processing and Communications at Graz University of Technology (TU\nGraz) were able to spy on information about data, keystrokes and encryption\nkeys on other people\u2019s computers in three different attacks via WebGPU.\n\n## An appeal to the browser manufacturers\n\nWebGPU is currently still under active development, but browsers such as\nChrome, Chromium, Microsoft Edge and Firefox Nightly versions already support\nit. Thanks to its greater flexibility and modernised design compared to WebGL,\nthe interface will be widely used in the coming years. \u201cOur attacks do not\nrequire users to interact with a website and they run in a time frame that\nallows them to be carried out during normal internet surfing. With our work,\nwe want to clearly point out to browser manufacturers that they need to deal\nwith access to the GPU in the same way as with other resources that affect\nsecurity and privacy,\u201d says Lukas Giner from the Institute of Applied\nInformation Processing and Communications at TU Graz.\n\nThe research team carried out its attacks on several systems in which\ndifferent graphics cards from NVIDIA and AMD were installed \u2013 the NVIDIA cards\nused were from the GTX 1000 series and the RTX 2000, 3000 and 4000 series,\nwhile the AMD cards used were from the RX 6000 series. For all three types of\nattack, the researchers used the access to the computer\u2019s cache memory\navailable via WebGPU, which is intended for particularly fast and short-term\ndata access by the CPU and GPU. This side channel provided them with meta-\ninformation that allowed them to draw conclusions about security-relevant\ninformation.\n\n## Changes in the cache as an indicator\n\nThe team was able to track changes in the cache by filling it themselves using\ncode in the JavaScript via WebGPU and monitoring when their own data was\nremoved from the cache by input. This made it possible to analyse the\nkeystrokes relatively quickly and accurately. By segmenting the cache more\nfinely, the researchers were also able to use a second attack to set up their\nown secret communication channel, in which filled and unfilled cache segments\nserved as zeros and ones and thus as the basis for binary code. They used 1024\nof these cache segments and achieved transfer speeds of up to 10.9 kilobytes\nper second, which was fast enough to transfer simple information. Attackers\ncan use this channel to extract data that they were able to attain using other\nattacks in areas of the computer that are disconnected from the internet.\n\nThe third attack targeted AES encryption, which is used to encrypt documents,\nconnections and servers. Here, too, they filled up the cache, but with their\nown AES encryption. The reaction of the cache enabled them to identify the\nplaces in the system that are responsible for encryption and access the keys\nof the attacked system. \u201cOur AES attack would probably be somewhat more\ncomplicated under real-time conditions because many encryptions run in\nparallel on a GPU,\u201d says Roland Czerny from the Institute of Applied\nInformation Processing and Communications at TU Graz. \u201cNevertheless, we were\nable to demonstrate that we can also attack algorithms very precisely. We did\nof course communicate the findings of our work to the browser manufacturers in\nadvance and we hope that they will take this issue into account in the further\ndevelopment of WebGPU.\u201d\n\nThe research work and accompanying paper will be presented at the ACM Asia\nConference on Computer and Communications Security from 1 to 5 July in\nSingapore.\n\nThis research topic is anchored in the Field of Expertise Information,\nCommunication & Computing, one of the five strategic research foci at TU Graz.\n\nWould you like to receive the latest stories, news, research stories,\ninterviews or blog posts from TU Graz directly on your smartphone or in your\nemail inbox?
