Therefore, in ultrashort optical pulses, where H can\ntemporarily reach high amplitudes, the Gilbert relaxation time can momentarily\nbe extremely short, reaching even picosecond timescales. Here we show that for\nstrong enough ultrashort pulses, the magnetization can respond within the\noptical cycle such that the optical control of the magnetization emerges by\nmerely considering the optical magnetic field in the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert\n(LLG) equation. Surprisingly, when circularly polarized optical pulses are\nintroduced, an optically induced helicity-dependent torque results. We find\nthat the strength of the interaction is determined by \u03b7=\u03b1\u03b3H/fopt, where fopt\nand \u03b3 are the optical frequency and gyromagnetic ratio, respectively. Our\nresults illustrate the generality of the LLG equation to the optical limit and\nthe pivotal role of the Gilbert damping in the general interaction between\noptical magnetic fields and spins in solids.\n\n5 More\n\n  * Received 19 January 2023\n  * Revised 18 May 2023\n  * Accepted 6 December 2023\n\nDOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.6.013012\n\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative\nCommons Attribution 4.0 International license.
