The movement grew, city by city, fueled by\npassionate volunteers that were inspired by the mission and vision. In 2013,\nWomen Who Code, Inc., was registered as a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in\nCalifornia and moved its headquarters to Atlanta, Georgia in 2018.\n\nAs a community, we are powerful. For more than a decade, Women Who Code has\ncreated a sense of belonging in tech and support for our community, thanks to\nthe dedication and commitment of our members, volunteers, and staff. We have\nbrought together a vibrant community of over 360,000 technologists who deeply\ncare about building an industry that is more diverse, inclusive, and\nequitable. Today, more than 1,000 volunteers lead local and digital\ncommunities, members in 145 countries worldwide give technical talks daily to\nshare knowledge and mentor each other, and a close-knit globally distributed\nteam at WWCode HQ drives the day to day operations.\n\nTogether, we\u2019ve delivered more than 20 thousand community-led events, awarded\nmore than $3.5 million in scholarships, held developer conferences and\ntechnical summits in tech hubs around the world, logged more than one million\nhigh-skilled, leadership-building volunteer hours, given away more than $2.5\nmillion in conference tickets for broader industry engagement, and shared more\nthan 14,000 job opportunities. Even more than these trackable outputs, we\u2019ve\ncome together to support each other, navigate the industry as a powerful\nforce, share both technical protips and strategies for rising in our careers,\nand break barriers.\n\nIt is with profound sadness that, today, on April 18, 2024, we are announcing\nthe difficult decision to close Women Who Code, following a vote by the Board\nof Directors to dissolve the organization. This decision has not been made\nlightly. It only comes after careful consideration of all options and is due\nto factors that have materially impacted our funding sources - funds that were\ncritical to continuing our programming and delivering on our mission. We\nunderstand that this news will come as a disappointment to many, and we want\nto express our deepest gratitude to each and every one of you who have been a\npart of our journey.\n\nWhile so much has been accomplished, our mission is not complete and our\nvision of a tech industry where diverse women and historically excluded people\nthrive at every level is not fulfilled.\n\nDespite our collective efforts, the challenges we face as an organization have\nbecome insurmountable. We are deeply saddened by the difficult decision to\ndissolve the entity, but we hope that this work carries on beyond our end. The\ncollective efforts of tech company leaders and supporters are needed more than\never to welcome women into tech, keep them, and ensure they are given the\nopportunity to thrive.\n\nTo the women in technology, if you have been inspired, made a career\nconnection, leveled up your technical skills, or expanded your network through\nthis movement, we encourage you to keep paying that forward. The world needs\nwomen and diverse perspectives at the helm of tech as a critical force that\nshapes our world every day. Please, keep going.\n\nAs we embark on the process of winding down operations, we are committed to\nensuring a smooth transition and fulfilling any remaining obligations to the\nbest of our ability. Unfortunately, we will not be able to continue offering\nany program services, and will be canceling all upcoming events.\n\nAlthough this chapter is coming to a close, we believe that the spirit of our\ncommunity will endure and hope that the relationships and experiences gained\nthrough involvement with Women Who Code will continue to inspire you in your\nfuture endeavors.\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors and the entire Team Teal at Women Who\nCode, we extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who has been a part of the\nmovement \u2013 our members, volunteers, partners, team, allies, and supporters \u2013\nand encourage you to continue to seek support from other like-minded\norganizations who authentically support the careers of women in the tech\nindustry and keep inspiring each other as you navigate the industry. It has\nbeen an honor and a privilege to serve the mission, and work alongside such\npassionate individuals.\n\nThank you for your understanding and support during this challenging time.\n\nTeam Teal @ Women Who Code\n\n## Related Posts\n\n### The End of an Era: Women Who Code Closing\n\n2024-04-18T20:36:53\n\n### Sustainable Web Development: Website Redesign with a Low Carbon Footprint\n\n2024-04-18T19:02:20\n\n### From Insights to Impact: My AI-Fueled Journey at the Epic AI Dev Summit\n\n2024-04-18T19:00:07\n\n* For Companies\n* Blog\n* Podcast\n* Donate\n\n* Membership\n\n  * Become a Member\n  * Events\n  * Mentorship\n  * Communities\n  * Applaud Her\n  * Coding Resources\n  * CODEReview\n  * Scholarships & Tickets\n\n* Get Involved\n\n  * Volunteer\n  * Sponsor\n  * Shop\n  * Donate\n  * Women's History Month\n\n* Job Board\n\n  * View Jobs\n  * Post a Job\n  * Jobs FAQ\n\n* About Us\n\n  * WWCode Careers\n  * Press\n  * Partners\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Code of Conduct\n  * Contact Us\n\n\u00a9 2024 Women Who Code\u00b7 All Rights Reserved.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
