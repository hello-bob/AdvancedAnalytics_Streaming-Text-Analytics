While\nresearch suggests that the brain can tell the difference between different\nsweet substances, the neural processes underlying this ability to tell\nsweeteners apart remain poorly understood.\n\nResearchers at University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, the Chinese\nAcademy of Sciences (CAS), and other institutes in China recently carried out\na study aimed at better understanding what happens in the brain of mice when\nthey are fed different types of sweeteners. Their findings, published in\nNeuroscience Research, suggest that the response of neurons to sucrose and\nstevia is similar, suggesting that stevia could be an equally pleasant but\nhealthier sugar substitute.\n\n\"Obesity is a significant issue worldwide, and the use of sweeteners as a\nsubstitute for sucrose is a current trend in the food industry,\" Yingjie Zhu,\nco-author of the paper, told Medical Xpress. \"Although they all possess\nsweetness, many sugar substitutes have noticeable differences compared to\nsucrose when consumed. Therefore, our initial idea was to investigate whether\nthere would be a specific brain region in the central nervous system that\ncould reflect the differences between these sugar substitutes and sucrose in\nreal-time.\"\n\nStevia is a widely used sweetener derived from leaves of a plant native to\nSouth America. Many dieticians recommend stevia as a sugar substitute, as it\nis very sweet but has fewer calories and minimal effects on blood glucose\nlevels. The key objective of the recent work by Zhu and his colleagues was to\ninvestigate how the brain of mice responded after they had consumed stevia,\nsugar, or one of three other sweeteners (i.e., xylitol, glycyrrhizin, and\nmogroside).\n\nThe team hoped to unveil how neurons in the mouse brain responded to the\nconsistent consumption of these different sweeteners over a six-week period.\nIn addition, they were interested in determining whether any of the low-\ncalorie sweeteners they examined elicited similar brain responses to sugar.\n\n\"Our previous research identified that the activity of neurons in the\nparaventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) can track stimulus salience,\"\nZhu explained. \"Therefore, as part of our new study, we recorded the activity\nintensity in the PVT of mice while they consumed various sweeteners and\nsucrose.\"\n\nThe researchers fed mice six different diets for a period of six weeks. One\ngroup of mice was fed a so-called control diet (with a mixture of sweeteners),\nwhile the other groups were fed a diet with high amounts of sugar, stevia,\nxylitol, glycyrrhizin, or mogroside, respectively.\n\nZhu and his colleagues recorded the activity of neurons in the brain of the\nmice in real-time, using in vivo fluorescence calcium imaging. This an\nexperimental technique that allows scientists to monitor changes in calcium\nlevels within cells, which in turn unveils these cells' activity patterns.\n\nInterestingly, the team's recordings revealed that compared to other sugar\nsubstitutes considered as part of this study, stevia induced activity in the\nPVT that more closely resembled that elicited by sugar intake. This suggests\nthat stevia is the most \"brain compatible\" among most widely used sugar\nalternatives, most closely mirroring the perceived taste of sugar.\n\n\"We found that, given an abundance of food supply, compared to other sugar\nsubstitutes, the activity in the PVT brain region induced by stevia was most\nsimilar to that induced by sucrose,\" Zhu said. \"This suggests that stevia\ncould potentially be the most brain-compatible sugar substitute. Therefore, in\nthe relevant food and beverage industries, stevia should receive more\nattention.\"\n\nIn the future, this recent study could encourage more food & drink producers\nto incorporate stevia in their products to reduce their calorie count. In\naddition, it could inspire other neuroscientists to further examine the neural\nunderpinnings of stevia consumption.\n\n\"We were delighted to observe a high similarity in brain activity in mice when\nconsuming stevia and sucrose,\" Zhu added. \"Consequently, we hope to\ninvestigate whether a similar phenomenon exists in the human brain using fMRI\nin future studies.\"\n\nMore information: Shaolei Jiang et al, Neuronal activity in the anterior\nparaventricular nucleus of thalamus positively correlated with sweetener\nconsumption in mice, Neuroscience Research (2024).
