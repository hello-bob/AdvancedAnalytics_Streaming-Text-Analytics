The new work represents \u201cthe strongest statistical evidence yet that\nPlanet 9 is really out there\u201d, he said.\n\nIn the new work, scientists looked at a set of trans-Neptunian objects, or\nTNOs, which is the technical term for those objects that sit out at the edge\nof the solar system, beyond Neptune\n\nThe new work looked at those objects that have their movement made unstable\nbecause they interact with the orbit of Neptune. That instability meant they\nwere harder to understand, so typically astronomers looking at a possible\nPlanet Nine have avoided using them in their analysis.\n\nResearchers instead looked towards those objects, and tried to understand\ntheir movements. And, Dr Bogytin claimed, the best explanation is that they\nresult from another, undiscovered planet.\n\nThe team carried out a host of simulations to understand how those objects\u2019\norbits were affected by a variety of things, including the giant planets\naround them such as Neptune, the \u201cGalactic tide\u201d that comes from the Milky\nWay, and passing stars.\n\nThe best explanation was from the model that included Planet Nine, however, Dr\nBogytin said. They noted that there were other explanations for the behaviour\nof those objects \u2013 including the suggestion that other planets once influenced\ntheir orbit, but have since been removed \u2013 but claim that the theory of Planet\nNine remains the best explanation.\n\nBetter understanding of the existence or not of Planet Nine will come when the\nVera C Rubin Observatory is turned on, they note. That is currently being\nbuilt in Chile, and when it is turned on it will be able to scan the sky to\nunderstand the behaviour of those distant objects.\n\n\u201cThis upcoming phase of exploration promises to provide critical insights into\nthe mysteries of our solar system\u2019s outer reaches,\u201d the team writes in their\npaper.\n\nA paper describing the work, \u2018Generation of Low-Inclination, Neptune-Crossing\nTNOs by Planet Nine\u2019, is available now on arXiv.\n\n## Join our commenting forum\n\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see\ntheir replies\n\nComments\n\n### 1/1Scientists say there is evidence of an unknown planet in solar system\n\n### Scientists say there is evidence of an unknown planet in solar system\n\nArtist\u2019s conception of Planet Nine\n\nCaltech/R.
