And almost no reviews include audio samples to compare.\n\nSo I set out to change that. Some commonly recommended mics were\ndisappointing, some were right on, and I\u2019ve found some real gems that were\npreviously unknown in my podcasting circles.\n\n## Quick favorites\n\nFor most people\u2019s needs:\n\n  * Favorite XLR mics:\n\n    * $400 range: Earthworks ETHOS (the current best at any price)\n    * $250 range: Shure Beta 87A\n    * $100 range: Rode PodMic\n  * Favorite USB mics:\n\n    * $250 range: Shure MV7\n    * $100 range: Audio-Technica ATR-2100x\n\n## Jump to:\n\n  * Full ranking\n  * XLR or USB?\n  * XLR interfaces\n  * Condenser vs. dynamic and pickup patterns\n  * Boom arms and shockmounts\n  * Cables\n  * Mute switches\n  * Headphones\n  * Travel\n  * Other Reviews\n  * What did I miss?\n\n## Full ranking\n\nEvery microphone accentuates and suppresses different characteristics, so what\nworks for one person may not sound as good with another.\n\nI\u2019ve provided sound samples from both my wife and me for comparison: I have a\nmore nasal voice, while she has a smoother tone. My voice is more \u201cpicky\u201d with\nmics, while she sounds great on almost anything. I need more midrange\nsmoothness, while she needs more sibilance suppression. I speak more loudly,\nand her quieter levels reveal background hiss more easily. And while we both\nhave podcasts, neither of us are professionally trained announcers or have a\nbackground in radio \u2014 just like most podcasters.\n\nAll audio samples were captured without any processing except loudness\nnormalization to \u201318 LUFS.\n\nFrom most to least favorite, considering sound quality, value, and\npracticality for podcasters who aren\u2019t recording in professional studios:\n\n  1. Earthworks ETHOS (XLR condenser): $400, plus a $100+ XLR interface This is the microphone I use. Incredible sound and practicality, and my favorite mic to date. It\u2019s warm, smooth, and detailed, with zero background hiss. Its supercardioid pickup pattern captures relatively little room echo and background noise, it\u2019s extremely easy to drive even from inexpensive XLR interfaces and portable recorders, and has built-in shockmounting and pop filtering. This is the best sound quality I\u2019ve found that\u2019s also practical in a home environment. It\u2019s sturdy, heavy, and made of stainless steel, yet more compact and attractive compared to other popular microphones (making it great for video). Even the built-in swivel mount is a joy to use for quick angle adjustments. I absolutely love the ETHOS, and I haven\u2019t found a better all-around podcast microphone in the world at any price. For almost any podcasting needs except hand-held use, stop right here \u2014 you\u2019re done. Shockmount: Not necessary Pop filter: Included, foam Sample:\n\n  2. Shure Beta 87A (XLR condenser): $260, plus a $100+ XLR interface An incredibly practical, good-sounding mic. Its supercardioid pickup pattern captures relatively little room echo and background noise, and it can be powered by inexpensive XLR USB interfaces and portable recorders. Its compact, durable enclosure is better suited for travel, stage, or hand-held use than the Earthworks ETHOS or Electro-Voice RE20, although it doesn\u2019t sound quite as good. This versatile, mid-priced mic is great for most podcasters, with one exception: if your speech has strong sibilance (harsh \u201csss\u201d sounds), the 87A accentuates that, and you\u2019d be better served by the ETHOS, RE20, or KMS 105. Shockmount: Not necessary Pop filter: Recommended, $12 mount combo or $10 foam Sample:\n\n  3. Electro-Voice RE20 (XLR dynamic): $450, plus a $100+ XLR interface A great all-arounder: excellent sound, great suppression of background noise and room echo, and very forgiving of amateur mic technique. It\u2019s an industry standard for good reasons, and if you prefer the way voices sound on traditional radio-studio dynamic microphones, the RE20 sounds much better on more voices than the Shure SM7B. Like many large dynamics, it needs a powerful preamp, but not as much as the SM7B. It has a classic studio enclosure that\u2019s very durable, but this makes it very large and heavy, especially with its shockmount. Shockmount: Recommended, $110 Pop filter: Not necessary Sample: (US-2x2) Sample: (USBPre 2)\n\n  4. Neumann KMS 105 (XLR condenser): $730, plus a $100+ XLR interface Extremely similar to the Beta 87A in physical characteristics, but with better sound that\u2019s almost as great as the ETHOS. It\u2019s warm and smooth without losing detail, with zero background hiss. Like the 87A and ETHOS, it\u2019s a supercardioid mic that\u2019s very good at suppressing noise and room echo, is easy to drive, and doesn\u2019t need a shockmount, although a pop filter is recommended. I love this mic and used it as my main podcasting mic for years, but it\u2019s not worth nearly double the price of the similar-but-better ETHOS unless you need its shape for stage or hand-held use. Shockmount: Not necessary Pop filter: Recommended, $12 mount combo or $10 foam (same as 87A) Sample:\n\n  5. Audio-Technica ATR2100x-USB (USB and XLR dynamic): $100 An amazing value for the money: it sounds great for the price, and pretty decent at any price, as long as you speak up very closely to it. With USB-C and XLR outputs, and a built-in headphone jack for USB mode, I don\u2019t know of a cheaper or simpler all-in-one solution to recommend, especially for a beginner or a minimal travel setup. Compared to other inexpensive USB mics aimed at beginners like the Blue Yeti, the ATR2100x picks up far less room echo and background noise, and is much easier to travel with. But you have to speak up closely to it \u2014 if you\u2019re using its desk stand, elevate it up to mouth level (with e.g. a stack of books) if possible. This replaces the older ATR2100, a solid budget/travel recommendation for years. Shockmount: Not necessary Pop filter: Necessary, $6 Sample: (USB) Sample: (XLR) Sample: (Desk distance)\n\nCompared to its predecessor, the ATR2100: Sample:\n\n  6. Pyle PDMIC58 (XLR dynamic): $10\u201320, plus a $100+ XLR interface A stunning value, this cheap knockoff of the Shure SM58 sounds amazing for the price \u2014 in fact, it sounds better than most of the dynamic mics I\u2019ve tested at any price. It\u2019s easy to drive from inexpensive interfaces, and like most dynamics, it picks up very little background noise and room echo. It feels pretty sturdy, although I don\u2019t know how much longevity or consistency to expect out of such a cheaply made knockoff. Still, I can\u2019t believe how good it is for this price. Shockmount: Not necessary Pop filter: Necessary, $6 Sample: (Tascam US-2x2) Sample: (Behringer UM2) Sample: ($12 XLR-USB cable)\n\n  7. Electro-Voice RE320 (XLR dynamic): $300, plus a $100+ XLR interface A good all-arounder: like the higher-end RE20, it has excellent sound, great suppression of background noise and room echo, and is forgiving of amateur mic technique. The RE20 sounds more smooth and neutral to me, but the RE320 gets you much of the way there. Shockmount: Recommended, $110 Pop filter: Not necessary Sample:\n\n  8. Rode PodMic (XLR dynamic): $100, plus a $100+ XLR interface Intended as a less-expensive alternative to the SM7B, it has a built-in mount, pop filter, and internal shockmount, and needs a pretty strong, low-noise preamp (although not as much as the SM7B). Sound quality, tone, and handling are comparable to other dynamic mics in its price range, so it\u2019s a nice alternative if you\u2019re looking for something compact and inexpensive to mount on a boom arm. Shockmount: Recommended, $110 Pop filter: Not necessary Sample:\n\n  9. Shure MV7 (USB and XLR dynamic): $250 (also available as XLR-only) Like a slightly scaled-down SM7B in most good ways, without the huge gain requirements, and with a USB interface built in. It suffers a bit from increased plosive and sibilance pickup compared to the SM7B, and has awkward digital touch controls (why?) for gain and headphone volume. The sound is right down the middle for a dynamic mic: it makes everyone sound acceptable, but makes nobody sound great. It\u2019s a versatile all-arounder and competes very well against other USB mics, but isn\u2019t anything special compared to similarly priced XLR options. Shockmount: Not necessary Pop filter: Included, foam; an additional generic clip-on pop filter is recommended Sample: (XLR) Sample: (USB)\n\n  10. Blue Yeti (USB condenser): $130 The Yeti has been recommended for years as an inexpensive starter mic. Getting good sound out of it takes some work and additional gear: it needs a strong pop filter, it picks up a lot of room echo, and its included desk stand keeps the mic too far away for good sound. But it\u2019s a great value, and under ideal circumstances \u2014 close-up use in a silent, soft room with a pop filter \u2014 it can yield excellent sound quality. (The Yeti has selectable pickup patterns. These were using the cardioid setting, which both Blue and I recommend for podcasting.) Shockmount: Recommended, $70 Pop filter: Necessary, generic clip-on, $10+ Sample: (Desk stand) Sample: (Up close, with pop filter)\n\n  11. Sennheiser MD 421-II (XLR dynamic): $380, plus a $100+ XLR interface A good dynamic all-arounder with a smooth, warm tone, but a bit too muffled-sounding for me. I also have concerns about the cheap-feeling plastic shell and mount, which don\u2019t belong on a mic in this price class. But like most good dynamics, it\u2019s good at rejecting noise and room echo, and isn\u2019t very picky, so it\u2019s practical for home podcasting. It\u2019s a good mic overall. Shockmount: Optional, $60 Pop filter: Necessary, $35 or the $6 SM58 one fits Sample: (1-step bass cut)\n\n  12. Telefunken M82 (XLR dynamic): $400, plus a $100+ XLR interface Great sound for a dynamic when its High Boost switch is enabled, with great suppression of background noise and room echo as well. But it requires a powerful preamp, increasing the likely cost of your XLR interface. It\u2019s a great alternative to the Heil PR 40, with similar gain requirements, no pop filter required, and a more even tone. Shockmount: Optional, sold in $500 bundle with boom arm Pop filter: Not necessary Sample: (High Boost, Blackjack) Sample: (High Boost, USBPre 2) Sample: (Varying settings, USBPre 2)\n\n  13. Audio-Technica BP40 (XLR dynamic): $350, plus a $100+ XLR interface Below-average sound, but great suppression of background noise and room echo, and easy to drive from any XLR interface. It\u2019s a practical choice for home podcasters, like the Beta 87A \u2014 but I\u2019d say the 87A has all of the same benefits with better sound, a lower price, and more versatility. Shockmount: Optional, $100 (Bundle with mic at BSW) Pop filter: Recommended, $32 Sample:\n\n  14. Shure PG42-USB (USB condenser): $250 A nice all-in-one USB mic with a headphone jack. Compared to the Blue Yeti, it\u2019s much smaller and comes equipped with a shockmount to go on a boom arm rather than the Yeti\u2019s inadvisable but included desk stand. It picks up more treble crispness and detail than the Yeti, but also more background noise and room echo. The PG42 also lacks the Yeti\u2019s convenient mute button, and unlike most USB mics, cannot be soft-muted by apps like Shush. But it sounds incredible if you\u2019re in a very quiet room full of soft things. (An XLR version of the PG42 is also available for just $130 \u2014 an incredible value for sound quality.) Shockmount: Included Pop filter: Necessary, generic clip-on, $10+ Sample: (with pop filter)\n\n  15. Sennheiser MD 441-U (XLR dynamic): $900, plus a $100+ XLR interface A great dynamic all-arounder with a smooth, warm tone and a very high price for a podcasting mic. Like most dynamics, it\u2019s good at rejecting noise and room echo, but it does need a good preamp to minimize background hiss. It\u2019s a great mic overall, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s better enough than the RE20 or MD 421-II for podcasting, which sell for half or less. Shockmount: Not necessary Pop filter: Necessary, $56 Sample: (1-step bass cut)\n\n  16. Neumann TLM 102 (XLR condenser): $700, plus a $100+ XLR interface A well-regarded studio condenser mic that sounds great with no inherent noise, but is extremely unforgiving of room echo, and absolutely requires a pop filter and shockmount. It\u2019s very expensive for podcasters, especially with the required accessories. For all of the cost and hassle, you do get what I consider the best-sounding microphone here \u2014 I love the way this sounds when the room conditions are right \u2014 but the improvement above other condensers here, like the inexpensive Blue Yeti, is pretty subtle, and it\u2019s nearly indistinguishable from the much cheaper PG42 (the PG42 is a bit more harsh in the treble and \u201cS\u201d-sibilance pickup). Shockmount: Necessary, $130 Pop filter: Necessary, foam ($50) or generic ($10+) Sample: (with pop filter)\n\n  17. Sennheiser e865 (XLR condenser): $270, plus a $100+ XLR interface Very similar to the Beta 87A and Neumann KMS 105, other small condensers made for stage vocals, but with a warmer and slightly muffled sound, and more background hiss. Like the 87A, it\u2019s very good at suppressing noise and room echo, is easy to drive, and doesn\u2019t need a shockmount or pop filter. But the 87A has all of the same strengths, at about the same price, with better sound. Shockmount: Not necessary Pop filter: Not necessary Sample:\n\n  18. Heil PR 40 (XLR dynamic): $325, plus a $100+ XLR interface A lot of podcasters love this, but it just doesn\u2019t work for me. It needs a lot of power and an expensive preamp to sound good without hiss, and it has a weirdly unnatural sound: there\u2019s way too much of the deepest bass, but seemingly no mid- or upper-bass, sounding \u201cthin\u201d overall but also with too much bass. I think people like it because the overabundance of deep bass makes them sound more like hypercompressed radio DJs, but it doesn\u2019t sound right in the world of podcasting, influenced more by public radio and hobbyists, where a less-processed natural sound is the norm. Shockmount: Necessary, $105 Pop filter: Recommended, $60 Sample: (Blackjack, with pop filter) Sample: (USBPre 2, with pop filter)\n\n  19. Shure SM7B (XLR dynamic): $400, plus a $100+ XLR interface I wanted to love this classic mic so much and spent a lot of time and money chasing that dream, but it\u2019s outclassed by modern competitors in both sound quality and practicality. The SM7B lacks high-frequency detail, accentuates unflattering nasal-sounding midrange frequencies, unforgivingly picks up any room echo or background noise, and needs so much gain that some baseline hiss is always noticeable, even with great preamps. (Yes, I\u2019ve tried the Cloudlifter \u2014 in a back-to-back test with and without it, after level-matching, I found that it made no audible difference.) If you like the warm sound and classic look from traditional radio studios, the Electro-Voice RE20 sounds better than the SM7B and is easier to power. For a modern look and more detailed sound, the Earthworks ETHOS is the same price and dramatically outclasses the SM7B. Shockmount: Not necessary Pop filter: Included, foam Sample: (Blackjack) Sample: (USBPre 2)\n\n  20. Shure Beta 58A (XLR dynamic): $160, plus a $100+ XLR interface All of the practicality of the Beta 87A but with noticeably worse sound, sounding bass-heavy and somewhat muffled due to very weak treble pickup. Spring for the 87A if you can \u2014 it\u2019s worth the difference. Shockmount: Not necessary Pop filter: Recommended, $6 Sample: (with pop filter)\n\n  21. Earthworks ICON USB (USB condenser): $350 An attractive mic made with heavy-duty, high-quality metal that sounds truly excellent \u2014 better than every USB mic I\u2019ve tested to date \u2014 except for the noticeable background hiss from its built-in preamp. It comes with a low desk stand, but I recommend raising it up to face height with some books or boxes, or simply mounting it (with its excellent swivel mount) on a boom arm. Its practicality as a podcast mic is limited by its lack of zero-latency hardware headphone monitoring \u2014 you can\u2019t hear yourself through the headphones (unless you use complex software that will introduce latency). If a future version offered zero-latency headphone monitoring, a headphone volume knob, and lower self-noise, it would be the best USB mic in the world, but I can\u2019t recommend the current ICON for podcasting. Shockmount: Not necessary Pop filter: Included, metal mesh; a generic clip-on pop filter would help but isn\u2019t necessary Sample: (Up close) Sample: (Desk distance)\n\n  22. Audio-Technica AT2020 USB Plus (USB condenser): $150 A solid contender among the other USB condensers. The Yeti sounds better to me and has a mute button, but is much larger and doesn\u2019t mount easily to a boom; the PG42 is better equipped, but more expensive and can\u2019t be soft-muted. Like most other condensers, the AT2020 is unforgiving of room echo and background noise, and absolutely requires a pop filter. And like the Yeti and Nessie, using its desk stand at a typical seating height isn\u2019t recommended. Shockmount: Necessary, $46 Pop filter: Necessary, generic clip-on, $10+ Sample: (Desk stand) Sample: (Close up, with pop filter)\n\n  23. Blue Nessie (USB condenser): $85 Very similar to the Blue Yeti, but smaller and lacking the ability to be mounted on stands or booms. Go for the Yeti unless size is a major concern. Shockmount: Not compatible Pop filter: Not necessary Sample: (Desk stand) Sample: (Close up)\n\n  24. Rode Podcaster (USB dynamic): $230 The Podcaster is a convenient all-in-one USB mic, but its sound quality is poor, with a midrange emphasis that makes voices sound much more nasal and harsh. It also picks up a lot of background noise and room echo. It\u2019s not awful, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth its price. Shockmount: Necessary, $40 Pop filter: Not necessary Sample:\n\n  25. Apple EarPods built-in mic: free with any iPhone When you plug the EarPods into any Mac made in the last few years, the microphone (built into the clicker remote) takes over from the Mac\u2019s built-in mic. It\u2019s not great, but because it\u2019s so much closer to your mouth, it\u2019s a lot better than using the built-in mic from sitting distance. And it says a lot that it\u2019s not the worst mic here: I\u2019d say it edges out the last couple because it\u2019s not picky, it\u2019s small, it doesn\u2019t require any additional equipment, and you probably already own it. Shockmount: Nope Pop filter: Nope Sample:\n\n  26. Blue Snowball iCE (USB condenser): $50 I can\u2019t recommend this \u2014 the sound quality is simply too poor. In ideal conditions, it sounds harsh, and in anything less than ideal conditions, it amplifies every flaw. Even the best broadcaster in a silent studio would sound bad on this mic. And without a headphone jack for monitoring, it\u2019s of limited usefulness to podcasters looking for a USB mic \u2014 the ATR-2100 is a far better choice in this price range. Shockmount: Recommended, $43 Pop filter: Necessary, generic clip-on, $10+ Sample: (Close up) Sample: (Desk stand)\n\n  27. Samson C01U (USB condenser): $60 I can\u2019t recommend this due to its very audible, constant hissing noise in the recordings, indicative of poor-quality electronics inside. I haven\u2019t tested the newer Pro model with the headphone port, but based on this test, it sounds like it has a similar noise problem. Shockmount: Necessary, $25 Pop filter: Recommended, generic clip-on, $10+ Sample:\n\n## Condenser vs. dynamic and pickup patterns\n\nMost microphones today are either the condenser or dynamic type. For most\nmodels (but not all):\n\n  * Dynamics tend to be more practical for podcasters on tighter budgets: usually, they\u2019re less sensitive to vibration (if you tap the desk or mic stand) and plosives (loud \u201cpop\u201d sounds when hit with a blast of air, like when you pronounce the letter P).\n\nDynamics have poorer high-frequency pickup, making them sound more dull or\nmuffled than condensers, but this also typically results in less background\nnoise and room echo, which is more pragmatic for podcasters in non-\nprofessional studios.\n\nDynamics have a wide range of different sounds between different models. Many\npopular dynamic mics significantly \u201ccolor\u201d the sound, much like the audio\nequivalent of photo-effect filters, which can sound pleasing with a good match\nor unnatural with a poor one.\n\nDynamics rarely sound great, but more easily sound good.\n\n  * Condensers tend to pick up much more detail, which is great for sound quality, but usually makes them extremely unforgiving of room conditions, picking up more background noise, room echo, vibration, and plosives than most dynamics.\n\nDue to their detailed pickup of everything, good and bad, condensers can sound\namazing in ideal circumstances, but are often worse than dynamics in non-ideal\ncircumstances.\n\nMost condensers sound pretty similar to each other. They capture a more\nnatural sound than most dynamics, and tend to better represent the way a voice\nsounds in real life.\n\nInexpensive condensers, like the Blue Yeti or Audio-Technica AT2020, tend to\nbe even less forgiving and even more sensitive to conditions than higher-end\nmodels. What you\u2019re paying for with higher-end models is typically improved\nhandling and better rejection of unwanted noise, not large differences in\nsound quality under ideal conditions.\n\nMore important than condenser-vs.-dynamic is the pickup pattern:\n\n  * Cardioid is the most common, effectively picking up everything in front of the mic but suppressing most noise from behind it. Most microphones in this review, and indeed the vast majority of similar microphones on the market, are cardioid.\n\nCardioid is a great choice in most ways, but tends to pick up more room echo\nand background noise than supercardioid, especially for condensers.\n\n  * Supercardioid picks up sound in a narrower, closer radius. It requires keeping your mouth in a smaller area for consistent volume, so it\u2019s not great for amateurs who may move in and out of its pickup area.\n\nSupercardioid is much better than cardioid at suppressing room echo and\nbackground noise, making it ideal for podcasting at home.\n\nMost USB microphones are cardioid condensers. Beginning podcasters often pick\nan inexpensive USB condenser, like the Blue Yeti, but these usually make their\njobs harder by requiring big pop filters, close and consistent technique, and\npadded rooms to get good sound out of them.\n\nThree of my favorite mics \u2014 the Earthworks ETHOS, Neumann KMS 105, and Shure\nBeta 87A \u2014 are supercardioid condensers. These combine the practicality,\nforgiveness, and minimal noise of dynamics with the much better sound quality\nof condensers.\n\nIf a supercardioid condenser is available that fits your needs, I strongly\nrecommend that combination for podcasting.\n\n## XLR or USB?\n\nUSB microphones are convenient, all-in-one solutions with limited capabilities\nand no expandability, and if any part of them dies, that\u2019s it. They tend to be\ninexpensive but with relatively poor sound, and are made to low \u201cconsumer\u201d\nstandards for quality and durability. They\u2019re also not very versatile, making\nsome needs (like recording multiple people in the same room, or running a long\ncable) difficult or impossible.\n\nAn XLR microphone setup is made from multiple individual components that can\nbe separately bought and upgraded as necessary, usually resulting in higher\ncost and physical complexity (more components, wires, buttons, and knobs). XLR\nmics are typically built like tanks, last forever, and span a much larger and\nbetter sound-quality range. Recording from multiple XLR mics in the same room\nis easy, and XLR setups offer far more flexibility and versatility.\n\nIf you\u2019re just getting started with podcasting, a USB mic is good enough. If\nyou\u2019re established and looking to upgrade your production quality, or if you\njust love gear like me, you\u2019ll likely find the jump to XLR worthwhile.\n\n## XLR interfaces\n\nXLR microphones need to be connected and powered by XLR interfaces, which\nusually connect via USB. They should provide at least one XLR input and a\nheadphone jack to hear yourself live. Like so many things, they should ideally\nrequire no software to be installed \u2014 every feature should be available from\nthe hardware. And ideally, they should be bus-powered so there\u2019s no cheap\npower brick to flake out.\n\nThere are many XLR USB interfaces in the $100\u2013250 range that can acceptably\npower low-needs mics like the Shure Beta series and most condensers. These are\nmy favorite budget preamps:\n\n  * $130 Audient EVO 4\n  * $100 Rode AI-1\n\nJason Snell tested many inexpensive XLR interfaces as well.\n\nMy favorite interface is the $1000 Sound Devices USBPre 2, which is gloriously\ncovered in knobs, buttons, lights, and ports, and has no software whatsoever.\nThis is a prime example of how to throw money at a problem to make it go away.\nIt has extremely clean, powerful preamps that can easily drive every mic I\u2019ve\ntried (including the SM7B) with plenty of headroom, it\u2019s built like a tank,\nand it will most likely last a very long time. My only complaint (besides\nprice) is that the headphone output is noisy, but the recorded output and\nline-outs are perfect.\n\nFor similar prices, Sound Devices also makes the excellent, more modern, and\nmore feature-packed MixPre series, which are also amazing for this purpose and\ninclude useful features like more inputs, built-in recording, and mixing. I\nown and love multiple MixPres for different roles. But they introduce a very\nsmall amount of monitoring latency (about 3ms), and while most people won\u2019t\nnotice this, it makes me enjoy the USBPre 2 more for podcasting.\n\n## Boom arms and shockmounts\n\nBoom arms are much better than desk stands if you can tolerate their size \u2014\nthey allow freeform positioning within a huge area, so you can comfortably\nspeak at the proper angle and distance from the mic.\n\n  * The $100 Rode PSA1 is widely used and pretty good \u2014 it worked well for me for years.\n  * The $120 Heil PL-2T gets similar reviews as the Rode, but I haven\u2019t tried it.\n  * The $150 K&M 23850 integrates an XLR cable and has noticeably better build quality and stability than the Rode. If you\u2019re using an XLR mic and can spare the extra $50, get this.\n  * I now use the K&M 23860. It\u2019s even nicer, supporting more weight (ideal for the Electro-Voice RE20 or RE320) and hiding the springs and cable inside the thin, sleek arms.\n\nTo attach a mic to a boom arm (or any other universal mic stand), you\u2019ll need\na clip or shockmount with a standard screw thread on the end. There are two\ncommon sizes \u2014 3\u20448 and 5\u20448 inches \u2014 and this $4 adapter connects them if\nnecessary. Most booms come with one.\n\nThe PG42-USB comes with a shockmount, and the ETHOS and SM7B have the entire\nmount built in. For most other mics, you\u2019ll need to buy a compatible\nshockmount if you want one. Dynamic mics usually don\u2019t need them, but\ncondensers usually do.\n\nShockmounts are all structured very similarly but have different shapes,\nsizes, and attachment methods for different microphones. Usually, only the one\noffered by your microphone\u2019s manufacturer will fit. Many offer discounted\nbundles with the microphone, shockmount, and other accessories.\n\nMy favorite shockmounts for stage-sized microphones (Shure Beta 87A, Beta 58A,\nand SM58; Pyle Pro PDMIC-58; Neumann KMS 105; Sennheiser e865) are these\nplastic mounts with suspended metal-screen pop filters, sold under many\ndifferent brand names for about $12. Not only are they incredibly cheap and\nresult in a clean-looking and compact setup, but many consider metal-screen\npop filters to be the best kind. Set it to be about 1\u20442-inch from the front of\nthe microphone.\n\n## Cables\n\nFancy cables don\u2019t make a difference almost anywhere, including XLR cables,\nespecially since they\u2019re balanced. Get whatever XLR cables you want \u2014 I\u2019ve\naccumulated a range from cheap nameless ones up to overpriced Mogami cables,\nand it makes no difference, even when noise is a major concern like with the\nSM7B. XLR cables can also be pretty long before you hit noticeable issues, and\nunlike USB, multiple XLR cables can be daisy-chained without any adapters.\n\nMonoprice\u2019s recent audio cables are so unnecessarily thick they\u2019re bulky,\nstiff, and annoying, so my current go-to is Sendt, which are cheap, thin, and\nseemingly well made.\n\nUSB cables don\u2019t matter at all. You\u2019ll know if you have a bad one because it\nwon\u2019t work. If it works, it\u2019s fine. (I\u2019ve been using USB devices since USB 1.0\non my Pentium II in 1997, and I\u2019ve never seen a bad USB cable.)\n\n## Mute switches\n\nMost USB mics don\u2019t have mute switches, but Shush can mute many of them\n(although not the Shure PG42 USB) when you hold down an assignable keyboard\nkey.\n\nIf you want a mute button for an XLR mic, Shush probably won\u2019t work with your\nXLR USB interface, so you\u2019ll need to buy an actual hardware mute switch. This\nis one of those categories where everything sucks, like shaving mirrors, but\nthe one I use (which is merely OK) is the Rolls MS111. You\u2019ll need a second\nXLR cable. (Please don\u2019t tell me how great your shaving mirror is.)\n\n## Headphones\n\nI have a lot of headphone opinions for enjoying music. For podcasting, you\nneed these characteristics, in this order:\n\n  * Comfort: You\u2019re going to be wearing these for a while. They should be full-sized, over-ear \u201cstudio\u201d headphones that aren\u2019t too heavy and don\u2019t get too sweaty.\n  * Isolation: You don\u2019t want your headphone output to \u201cbleed\u201d out and be picked up by the microphone, so closed-back headphones are a must.\n  * Resolution: You don\u2019t need to go too crazy here, but you need decent detail and a wide frequency response. Headphones with muffled or missing tonal ranges might make you miss harsh flaws in your audio that many of your listeners will hear.\n  * Neutrality: If you mix on Beats, it\u2019ll only sound right on Beats. Mix with relatively neutral headphones and it\u2019ll sound the way your listeners expect.\n\nMy favorite headphones for podcast recording and editing are the $200\nBeyerdynamic DT-880 Pro 250-ohm, which I can wear for hours without\ndiscomfort, and seem to have very wide appeal to many people\u2019s different\ncomfort preferences. The 250-ohm version is my favorite because it has a\ncoiled cable, which I find helpful to reduce excess length getting in the way\nat my desk. For even greater comfort and a bit more isolation, upgrade them\nwith the EDT 1770D earpads.\n\nAnother great option is the $170 Audio-Technica ATH-M50x, a good all-arounder\nthat\u2019s also great for music, although I find the DT-880 more comfortable for\nlong spans. The ATH-M50x comes with two swappable cables \u2014 one coiled, one\nstraight.\n\nThe $80 Sony MDR-7506 is the cheapest I\u2019ve found that satisfies these needs\nwell enough, although it\u2019s poor for music listening (despite the common\nwisdom, its \u201crevealing\u201d nature is just midrange distortion), and the small,\nshallow earpads make it uncomfortable for long spans for people with larger\nears.\n\n## Travel\n\nTo record a podcast alone while you\u2019re away, you can\u2019t really beat the small\nsize and convenience of a USB mic.\n\nFor XLR mics, very small interfaces such as the $100 Shure X2U exist. They\u2019re\nnot very good, but they work in a pinch.\n\nIf you need to record multiple people in person with XLR mics and don\u2019t need\nor want to involve a computer, it\u2019s hard to beat Zoom and Tascam recorders,\nwhich can record multiple live tracks onto SD cards.\n\nA lot of people love the $250 Zoom H4n or $350 Zoom H6. They can be used as\nUSB XLR interfaces as well, but since their preamp quality isn\u2019t as good as\nmost standalone preamps in this price range, I wouldn\u2019t recommend that you buy\none primarily to be used as a USB audio interface, especially for a high-needs\nmic.\n\nAt the high end, it\u2019s hard to beat the $1060 Sound Devices MixPre-6 II, which\ncan serve all of these needs extremely well with a single device: XLR\ninterface at your computer, portable interface, and standalone recorder. This\nis what I use for my travel needs, and whenever I need to record multiple\npeople in the same room, but it\u2019s hard to justify if you\u2019re on a budget.\n\nFor a hand-held recorder, useful for capturing stereo ambience or live\ninterviews while standing up or moving, I love the $300 Zoom H5. Its\ninternally-shockmounted stereo microphone picks up relatively little handling\nnoise, its giant foam windscreen is suitable for outdoor recording, and the\nsound quality is competitive with many great full-sized condensers.\n\n## What did I miss?\n\nNobody\u2019s perfect, nobody has tried everything, and nothing works for everyone.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to include as many relevant microphones as possible while balancing\ncost (I have to buy them all), time, and likely usefulness for podcasting.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear about your experiences with podcasting gear on Twitter to\ninform future updates.
