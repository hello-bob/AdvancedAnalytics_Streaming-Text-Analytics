The monster rocket had been monstrously delayed, but the\nlaunch, which suffered a number of setbacks, including a hydrogen leak on the\npad, appeared to go off without a hitch.\n\nHowever, there were issues. Even to the eye of an untrained observer, the\nlaunch tower appeared to have taken quite a beating as the SLS left the pad.\nThe Orion capsule also encountered power issues during its mission, and NASA\nadmitted that there were some problems with the spacecraft's heat shield\nduring entry into the Earth's atmosphere, which merited further investigation\nbefore astronauts could ride the rocket to the Moon.\n\nIn a section entitled \"Orion Anomalies Pose Significant Safety Risks to the\nCrew,\" the OIG's report details the problems that cropped up during the\nmission.\n\nThe first is the heat shield, in which NASA has identified over 100 locations\nwhere bits of ablative material chipped away unexpectedly during reentry.\nWhile the shield would have protected the crew and capsule from the heat of\nreentry, it didn't melt as expected. Instead, a trail of fragments was left as\nportions of the shield cracked and broke away.\n\nThe fragments didn't impact the crew module or cause damage to the parachute\nmechanisms, but according to the OIG: \"Should the same issue occur on future\nArtemis missions, it could lead to the loss of the vehicle or crew.\"\n\n\"Unexpected behavior\" are two words an astronaut never wants to hear when\ndiscussing a component on which their life depends.\n\nThe issue has proven challenging to recreate. Due to the greater distances\ninvolved, Orion's velocity is, according to the OIG, approximately 40 percent\nfaster than that of a SpaceX Crew Dragon. However, engineers expect to come up\nwith answers in the first half of 2024.\n\nOther problems included melting and erosion of the separation bolts used to\nattach the crew module to the service module and \"uncommanded power\ndisruption\" during the mission. The latter, according to the OIG, \"are similar\nto a circuit breaker tripping in a home's electrical panel.\"\n\nNASA wasn't expecting either scenario but has determined that radiation was\nthe root cause of the power disruption. A hardware fix won't be ready in time\nfor Artemis II, but the flight software has been tweaked, and the Orion team\ntrained to deal with it.\n\n  * NASA plasma propulsion project promises Mars in a flash\n  * NASA solar sail boom demonstrator reaches orbit\n  * NASA's Psyche hits 25 Mbps from 140 million miles away \u2013 enough for Ultra HD Netflix\n  * Ex-Space Shuttle boss corrects the record on Hubble upgrade mission\n\nThe bolt problem, however, is trickier to deal with. The bolts are supposed to\nremain flush with the heat shield following separation from the service\nmodule. However, on Artemis I, three of the four bolts \"experienced an exposed\ngap that allowed for increased heating.\" The prospect of hot gas getting\nbehind the heat shield is a nightmarish scenario, and pending a redesign of\nthe separation bolt, NASA intends to add additional protective material and\npossibly change the reentry trajectory to reduce heating on the bolts.\n\nFinally, the Mobile Launcher 1 (ML-1) required more than five times the\nexpected $5 million to repair the damage caused by the launch. Tubing,\nelectrical equipment, panel doors, and elevators all needed to be repaired.\nGetting both elevators up and running again took approximately four months due\nto bent elevator car tracks.\n\nThe OIG said: \"According to an Agency official, going into the Artemis I\nmission it was not known that the elevator 'blast doors' were not in fact\nblast doors but rather fiberglass doors.\"\n\nStill, some comfort can be drawn from the fact that while there was a risk of\nbits of the ML-1 damaging the SLS during the first launch, it could have been\nmuch, much worse. The first Starship launch resulted in chunks of concrete\nfrom the launch platform being spread over a wide area.\n\nNASA pushed Artemis II back to September 2025 to give itself more time to\nunderstand the issues that arose during the Artemis I mission, a decision\napplauded by the OIG. However, the clock is ticking. China launched its\nChang'e 6 sample return mission to the far side of the Moon on May 3, and NASA\nis still proclaiming 2026 as the year in which Artemis III will launch and\nreturn astronauts to the Moon.\n\nThere is, however, a US election between now and then. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Artemis\n  * Moon\n  * NASA\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Artemis\n  * Moon\n  * NASA\n  * Space\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Asteroid\n  * Astronomy\n  * Black Hole\n  * CSA\n  * Earth\n  * ESA\n  * Exomoon\n  * Exoplanet\n  * Galaxy\n  * Hubble Space Telescope\n  * ISS\n  * James Webb Space Telescope\n  * JAXA\n  * Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory\n  * Perseverance\n  * Roscosmos\n  * Satellite\n  * Solar System\n  * Square Kilometre Array\n  * Voyager\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Federal government of the United States\n\n#### More about\n\n6 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Artemis\n  * Moon\n  * NASA\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Artemis\n  * Moon\n  * NASA\n  * Space\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Asteroid\n  * Astronomy\n  * Black Hole\n  * CSA\n  * Earth\n  * ESA\n  * Exomoon\n  * Exoplanet\n  * Galaxy\n  * Hubble Space Telescope\n  * ISS\n  * James Webb Space Telescope\n  * JAXA\n  * Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory\n  * Perseverance\n  * Roscosmos\n  * Satellite\n  * Solar System\n  * Square Kilometre Array\n  * Voyager\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Federal government of the United States\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Ex-Space Shuttle boss corrects the record on Hubble upgrade mission\n\nUnder Flight Rules, the crew should have turned back to Earth\n\nScience7 days | 31\n\n#### China to launch sample return mission to the far side of the Moon \u2013 maybe\nnext week\n\nAnd hatches 2030 plan to beat US for Mars rock retrieval\n\nScience3 days | 19\n\n#### NASA plasma propulsion project promises Mars in a flash\n\nSystem would also make it easier to transport much heavier spacecraft\n\nScience22 hrs | 19\n\n#### Boosting throughput for cloud databases\n\nAiven's bold move to scale up services for Redis users\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### NASA needs new ideas and tech to get Mars Sample Return mission off the\nground\n\nCurrent plans are too expensive and slow, meaning China could win race to\nscore red rocks\n\nScience17 days | 45\n\n#### NASA's Psyche hits 25 Mbps from 140 million miles away \u2013 enough for Ultra\nHD Netflix\n\nLaser beam comms are fast, so long as the weather cooperates\n\nScience6 days | 54\n\n#### Japan's Moon lander makes it through another lunar night\n\nWhat do we say to the God of Death?
