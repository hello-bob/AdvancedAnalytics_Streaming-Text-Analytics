Then it was immediately sued by\nthe son of a famous Supreme Court Justice.\n\nMatt Stoller\n\nApr 24, 2024\n\n134\n\nShare this post\n\n#### FTC Enrages Corporate America by Eliminating Non-Compete Agreements\n\nwww.thebignewsletter.com\n\n5\n\nShare\n\nWelcome to BIG, a newsletter on the politics of monopoly power. If you\u2019d like\nto sign up to receive issues over email, you can do so here.\n\nToday, the Federal Trade Commission, led by Chair Lina Khan, voted 3-2 to\neliminate contracts that stop people from switching jobs, contracts known as\n\u2018non-compete agreements.\u2019 The rule goes into effect in 120 days, and prohibits\nnearly all non-competes. There are a few exceptions; the FTC rule can\u2019t touch\nnon-competes with certain nonprofits and within few regulated industries. But\nby and large, this rule, unless conservative judges step in aggressively,\nmeans that American employers will no longer be able to use non-compete\nprovisions.\n\nIt\u2019s a big win. And yet, within a few hours of the vote, well-known\nconservative lawyer Eugene Scalia, the son of former Supreme Court Justice\nAntonin Scalia, sued the FTC over its non-compete ban, with the goal of\ngetting the judiciary to strike the rule down, and perhaps even declare the\ncommission itself unconstitutional. So what happened? What are the legal\narguments? What are the stakes? And who is likely to prevail? That\u2019s what I\u2019m\nwriting about today.\n\nThe FTC released this graphic with its rule.\n\n###\n\nWhat Happened? What Is a Non-Compete?\n\nLet\u2019s start with the guts of the dispute, which is over the actual policy to\neliminate non-compete agreements. These contracts are pervasive in America,\nlargely because computers have made it easy to print out employment contracts.\nOver the past four years, the FTC has been accumulating evidence, through\npublic comments and by reviewing economic data, showing that they are a\nserious problem in our economy, significantly depressing wages and business\nformation. I wrote about it extensively in 2023, when the government proposed\nthe rule:\n\n> Since 2000, the use of non-competes at all levels of society has exploded.\n> Eight years ago, one in five employees in the United States was bound by one\n> of these contracts, or 35-40 million people. It\u2019s no longer just high-level\n> employees who have them, but sandwich shop workers and janitors. For\n> instance, 30% of hair stylists works under a non-compete, as do 45% of\n> family physicians. Non-competes facilitate consolidation, especially in\n> health care, where doctors are trapped into practices bought by private\n> equity groups.\n>\n> Such contracts are already unenforceable or restricted in many states,\n> including California, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, New Hampshire,\n> North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, Virginia and Washington. And a\n> lot of non-competes are never enforced and barely noticed by the employer or\n> employee.\n>\n> Still, for many people, being bound by a non-compete can be a truly horrible\n> experience, a soft form of indentured servitude if you are tethered to a\n> place and a specific skillset. While the ostensible purpose of such\n> contracts is that an employee and employer are bargaining in a relatively\n> equal position over the terms of work, it\u2019s usually the case that employees\n> don\u2019t know what they are signing or aren\u2019t in a position to refuse. In some\n> states where non-competes are legally unenforceable, employers still\n> threaten employees who don\u2019t know any better.\n>\n> And this happens. A lot. One person who complained to me is a real estate\n> agent who had to put up with sexual harassment by a particularly litigious\n> boss. I\u2019ve heard from doctors whose lives are ruined by being forced to work\n> in a bad practice, but who cannot move because their family is rooted in a\n> particular area. One comment to the FTC came from a graphic designers for\n> signage who was bankrupted by a lawsuit from her control-hungry former boss\n> and a small town judge. These agreements are in every industry - finance,\n> doctors in rural areas, startup founders, printing, floor installations,\n> title and escrow work, software, NASA contracting, computer anti-virus\n> research, and video game production. The overall goal is to cut wages by\n> reducing the ability of people to bargain with rival employers.\n\nThe arguments against banning non-competes can seem compelling, but they don\u2019t\nstand up to scrutiny. Eliminating non-competes doesn\u2019t harm business, it helps\nit; Silicon Valley exists precisely because non-competes are unenforceable in\nthe state. And while workers can leave and take specialized knowledge or\ncustomers with them, such possibilities are better covered with non-\nsolicitation agreements or trade secrets law.\n\nOther practices, such as tenure-based wage increases, can reduce people\nleaving to go to competitors or setting up shop on their own. As for the idea\nthat non-competes reduce investments in knowledge-industries, well, that\nCalifornia exists undercuts that claim. Notably, lawyers simply don\u2019t allow\nnon-competes in the legal profession, the American Bar Association has a rule\nprohibiting them. And yet, the legal profession seems to exist and function.\n\n###\n\nThe Politics\n\nThe FTC has been playing out this process for years, because rules take a\nreally long time to get right. Today, its decision got wide coverage in print,\nTV, and online, trending on different social networks and drawing substantial\namounts of commentary, including from many people who would benefit. The\nPresident tweeted it out, members of Congress are discussing it, and it could\neven make an appearance in political campaigns.\n\nWas there much opposition? Not really, at least not publicly, with one\nexception. Few want to oppose the FTC\u2019s action directly, because it just feels\nicky to stand up for the right to prevent someone from quitting and getting a\nnew job. So the opposition is going to be procedural, and left to the courts.\n\nAnd yet, among big business, there is a high degree of public anger. The U.S.\nChamber of Commerce already said they\u2019d sue before the rule came out, but they\nwere leap-frogged by Scalia\u2019s client. Indeed, the speed and eagerness of the\ncomplaint was remarkable, revealing corporate lawyers will practically climb\nover hot coals to litigate against Khan in front of a Texas judge. The firm\nScalia is representing, a tax company called Ryan LLC, immediately put its\nchallenge on the top of the main page of its website, just below the slogan\n\u201cLiberating our clients from the burden of being overtaxed, freeing their\ncapital to invest, grow, and thrive.\u2019 Presumably, the corporation is using its\ncourt challenge as a marketing technique to attract clients whose executives\nhate Lina Khan.\n\nHere\u2019s their website homepage:\n\n###\n\nCan the FTC Just Ban These Contracts?\n\nDespite whatever handwringing you might hear about the FTC\u2019s legal authority,\nthe answer is yes. In Section 5 of the Federal Trade Act, Congress granted the\nFTC authority to ban \u201cunfair methods of competition.\u201d In Section 6(g),\nCongress granted the FTC the ability to \u201cmake rules and regulations for the\npurpose of carrying out the provisions\u201d of its charter. The FTC has used its\n6(g) authority many times, including 26 times between 1968-1973 on key high-\nprofile issues, like banning the mailing of unsolicited credit cards (which\nbanks did all the time until the commission acted to stop it.)\n\nSo the statute is clear. What about the courts? Well, in 1973, the D.C.\nCircuit Court ruled that the FTC \u201cis authorized to promulgate rules defining\nthe meaning of the statutory standards of the illegality the Commission is\nempowered to prevent.\u201d So there we go.\n\nAnd Congress? Well just a year later, in 1974, Congress changed the rule-\nmaking authority of the FTC on the consumer protection side, but left its\nrule-making authority on unfair methods of competition alone, even rejecting\namendment in which \u201c[t]he FTC would have been prohibited from prescribing\nrules with respect to unfair competitive practices.\u201d So Congress didn\u2019t\ncurtail the FTC, even though it could have.\n\nAnd these readings of FTC authority make sense historically as well. Congress\ncreated the FTC in 1914 because their attempt to regulate business through the\nSherman Antitrust Act had failed, as judges just couldn\u2019t stay on top of the\ninnovation in commerce. So legislators sought to create a regulatory\ncommission with a flexible mandate to define unfair practices.\n\nThere are significant limits in the FTC\u2019s authority; only the FTC can bring a\ncase that violates an FTC rule, private litigants can\u2019t. And of course it\u2019s\nall subjected to judicial review. But legislators debated whether to define\nbad practices clearly in statute, or let the FTC do it, and they chose the\nlatter. Non-compete agreements, because they became commonplace relatively\nrecently but are a method of commerce designed to inhibit competition, fall\nsquarely within this remit.\n\nSo you\u2019d think that the case for the FTC having legal authority would be a\nslam dunk. But it\u2019s not, for reasons I\u2019ll go into. In this case, Eugene Scalia\nmade four main points opposing FTC authority to issue the rule. First, he\nargued the text of the law granting the FTC authority hasn\u2019t been used a lot\nsince the 1970s, and so it didn\u2019t mean what it said. Second, he claimed the\ncourt precedent that interpreted the text was \u201ccontroversial at the time and\nhas not aged well,\u201d aka it\u2019s precedent that can be ignored. Third, he said\nthat other antitrust statutes treat non-compete agreements differently. And\nfourth, he made the point that a non-compete ban is a big economic change best\nleft to Congress. (Scalia also made some other arguments about how the FTC is\nstructured in an unconstitutional manner, but that\u2019s not particularly unique\nin this case.)\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how any of Scalia\u2019s points are relevant. The text of the\nstatute and court precedent are what controls, not whether a lawyer thinks a\nprecedent is old and bad. It also doesn\u2019t matter if other antitrust laws don\u2019t\napply, because, well, they are other antitrust laws, not this antitrust law.\nFinally, while the change is economically significant, so what? The FTC\u2019s\nauthority is broad-based, that\u2019s how Congress structured it. Doctrines putting\nlimits on regulators are meant to limit regulators to their existing statutory\nauthority, and the FTC has authority here.\n\n###\n\nWhat Are the Stakes? And Who Is Going to Win?\n\nStill, at some level, who is right doesn\u2019t matter, what matters is what a\njudge thinks. And in this case, the answer is that it\u2019s not really clear. The\ncase is initially going to Trump-appointed Dallas Judge Ada Brown, a former\nprosecutor, and plaintiff lawyer. After Brown hears the case, it might get\nappealed and go to the Fifth Circuit, and then the Supreme Court. It\u2019s also\npossible that the case gets dismissed for procedural reasons, and a different\nversion of it moves through the courts. Regardless, this one is likely to get\nappealed, regardless of the outcome at a lower level.\n\nHow will it be received by the higher courts? The question is how susceptible\njudges are to public scrutiny. Judges don\u2019t like to be unpopular. But at the\nsame time, corporate lawyers and judges have invented a suit of legal concepts\nto facilitate the consolidation of economic power, and many of those concepts\nare well-entrenched in the courts. Most came from a view in the 1960s and\n1970s that regulators had lost sight of the underlying text of a law, and\ntwisted and abused and expanded their authority untethered from legislative\ngoals. But gradually, the logic of attacking the excess reach of regulators\nbecame simply attacking regulators, even when the text of the statute is\nclear. Today, there are a lot of different legal theories whose intent was to\ntether rules to what Congress wrote, but instead often give judges lots of\nways to strike down rules that they don\u2019t like.\n\nThe stakes on all sides are high. If the FTC\u2019s rule is struck down, then it\nwill fall to Congress and states to ban non-competes, which will eventually\nhappen, but far more slowly. And the FTC will have a tool removed from its\narsenal, though to be honest, it\u2019s a tool the FTC hasn\u2019t used very often. That\nsaid, if the commission has its authority upheld, then not only will non-\ncompetes be unenforceable, but the FTC will be able to write rules to address\nother unfair methods of competition. Writing a rule is bureaucratically\nnightmarish, so these aren\u2019t going to come off the assembly line, and they\nrequire immense amounts of economic and legal work. But rule-writing is a way\nof addressing economy-wide unfair practices, as Congress intended for the FTC\nto operate, and it is potentially much faster than antitrust litigation, which\ncan take 5-10 years.\n\nAt any rate, you should feel proud of this decision, as it\u2019s been a long time\ncoming, and something we\u2019ve been involved in from the beginning. Big ideas\ntake awhile, but that\u2019s because they are big and have to be done properly. And\nthis is yet another sign we\u2019re starting to see the new way of thinking take\nroot.\n\nThanks for reading!
