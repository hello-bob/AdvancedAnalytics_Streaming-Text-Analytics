Yes, graphical. BBS and other text-only protocols were\nfun, but it was the WWW that captured minds and imagination. This imagination\nled to the Dot-com bubble, the Social Media bubble, the AI bubble... But we\nare getting ahead of ourselves. Back to the '90s!\n\nI'm not sure about you, but when I think about the '90s, the image of\nGeoCities springs to mind. The blink and marquee tags in early HTML were\nconsidered tasteful design choices. The war between Netscape and Internet\nExplorer was in full throttle.\n\nAnd obviously, the most important thing: it was the time when we coined the\nfirst-ever \"like\" button on the Internet, sort of. I'm talking, obviously,\nabout the Hit or Visitor Counter.\n\nsource\n\nIn those early days of the World Wide Web, the idea of dynamic, JavaScript-\nrich websites was yet to arrive. This meant that pretty much all information\non the website was rendered server-side. Yes, all you whipper-snappers,\nServer-Side Rendering was a thing in the early days as well.\n\nThe counters were often generated in Perl or PHP CGI scripts. The data itself\nwas either a form of counter in the database, a file, or the outcome of a\nquick grep command against an Apache Access Log.\n\nThese were not sophisticated tools, often gamed, and freshly launched websites\noften boasted thousands of previous visitors.\n\nMoreover, the counters, at least originally, did not account for user sessions\nand repeat visits. Bored teenagers, like myself, occasionally squatted on\nsomeone's website, hitting refresh and awing at the sight of an incrementing\nvisit count.\n\n## What's the point of this nostalgia?\n\nThis nostalgia points towards the Internet before the oligopoly of a few major\ntechnology companies. It was, arguably, the last decade of a free, and\nreasonably private Internet. It was also time of wild, diverse World Wide Web.\nEven today, some argue that it needs to be restored.\n\n> [...] the internet has become an extractive and fragile monoculture. We can\n> revitalise it, but only by \u201crewilding\u201d it [...]\n>\n> \\- John Naughton - The internet is in decline \u2013 it needs rewilding\n\nAs for privacy, webmasters weren't paying too much attention to privacy as we\nunderstand it today. Yes, the Apache logs contained the IP addresses of the\nvisitors, but these were nowhere centralized. It was highly unlikely that\nsomeone would be able to track you as you traversed multiple unrelated\nwebsites. Heck, even tracking your journey across sub-pages was highly\nuncommon.\n\nNowadays, almost every website out there loads a tracker script from either\nGoogle, Facebook, HubSpot, or others. Most websites showing you social\nengagement buttons like retweet, like, or share are loading external scripts.\nYour online footprint has grown exponentially since the '90s.\n\nTrackers, privacy abuse, and poorly worded attempts at regulating these in the\nform of Cookie Banners result in websites ballooning in size.\n\n## Rose-tinted view of the past\n\nNostalgia is cool. We often reminisce about the past through rose-tinted\nglasses. But it wasn't all good. The websites were small, the text, and code\npart at least. But multimedia assets, like images, animated GIFs, and later\nFlash animations, were easily exceeding megabytes in size.\n\nDo you remember the BMP image format? An image of 256\u00d7256 easily buffered for\na few seconds on a money-draining dial-up modem. We easily take for granted\nthe efficient compression offered by the PNG format and tools like TinyPNG.\n\nAnd the awful look and feel, Fisher-Price colours, and bouncing text were\nannoying at best, and felt abusive at worst.\n\nToday, the retro look of the '90s is reserved mostly for the enthusiasts.\n\nsource\n\n## Closing words\n\nGeoCities is dead. JavaScript scripts easily weigh 2 MB on an average website,\ntypically more than the sum of high-quality images. Long gone are the simple\nvisitor counters. But so is our privacy and diversity on the web.\n\nMore than two decades ago, we, the website operators, then called webmasters,\nmindlessly slapped marquee tags and popups on the website. Today, we\nmindlessly add numerous JavaScript trackers and then Cookie Banner pop-ups to\ncounter those trackers.\n\nIt doesn't have to be this way. Enjoy building bold, great-looking websites.\nDelight your visitors and customers. Collect pageviews and user counts, even\nmore efficiently than in the past. But do it without enlarging your visitors'\nonline footprints. Do it without annoying, intrusive, and slow Cookie Banners.\n\nLooking for web analytics that do not require Cookie Banner and avoid\nAdblockers?
