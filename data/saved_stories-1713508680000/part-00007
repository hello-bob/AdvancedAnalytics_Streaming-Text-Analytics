She\nfocuses on tea varieties that come from a single plant, including green,\nblack, white, yellow, oolong and pu\u2019er teas, as opposed to rooibos, chamomile\nor other herbal teas with much different origins.\n\nHumans have a long history of fiddling with flora to access its desirable\nproperties. Francl writes that the medical use of plants among modern humans\ndates back at least 60,000 years.\n\nModern tea culture boils down to one specific plant dubbed C. sinensis. It\u2019s\nnot quite clear how the tea plant \u2014 or the practice of tea-making itself \u2014\ncame to be, Francl says. But we do know that today\u2019s teas exist thanks to\nmillennia of experimentation, plus intricate production processes that require\na dizzying number of precise steps.\n\nMichelle Francl is the Frank B. Mallory professor of chemistry at Bryn Mawr\nCollege, an adjunct scholar of the Vatican Observatory and author of the new\nbook \u201cSteeped: The Chemistry of Tea.\u201d Photo by Aaron Windhorst/Bryn Mawr\nCollege\n\nIf you\u2019re a newcomer to the world of tea, Francl recommends two types to try\nstarting out with: green snail tea, which she describes as \u201csweet\u201d and\n\u201cgrassy,\u201d and a pu\u2019er tea named \u201cCelestial Tribute.\u201d\n\nFrancl, who is a professor of chemistry at Bryn Mawr College and an adjunct\nscholar of the Vatican Observatory, spoke to PBS NewsHour about the chemistry\nthat goes into making and flavoring tea, and how to wield this \u201cscience of\nchange\u201d to brew yourself the perfect cup.\n\nThis interview has been condensed and edited for clarity\n\n### Where does tea come from?\n\nCamellia sinensis is a single plant that grows in China. It\u2019s been cultivated\nso long that they can\u2019t find a wild version of it. So it\u2019s a plant that\u2019s been\ncultivated for a very long time, and that one plant gives rise to all the\ndifferent varieties of tea.\n\nThe compounds in the tea vary with the time that they\u2019re picked. There\u2019s [a]\nfirst blooming in the spring, later blooming in the spring. And those will\nalso have different properties.\n\n### How is tea processed? Why has it been referred to as a work of art?\n\nIt\u2019s the chemistry that changes the plant into all these incredibly different\nteas [after the leaves are picked]. There are enzymes in the tea that can\ncause oxidation \u2014 the same thing that causes browning in apples or bananas.\n\nSo you pick it, and you\u2019re very careful not to bruise things. For green tea,\nwhat you want to do is heat it up really quickly so you destroy those enzymes,\nso they can\u2019t oxidize things and turn it brown. With black tea, you want to\ncapitalize on that. You let them wilt a little bit to start kind of softening\nup the cells, and then you deliberately bruise them to get that oxidation\nstarted. And that\u2019s what eventually leads to those beautiful colors in a cup\nof black tea, which is almost ruby red.\n\nIn the end, what you\u2019re getting is something that you\u2019re going to drink. And\nthat whole experience from the color in the cup to the scent to the taste \u2014 as\nwell as the caffeine content \u2014 all those things are sensory experiences. So\nthat\u2019s where the art comes in \u2014 you want to have the sensory experience that\nyou desire at the end.\n\nFew things are more British than a cup of tea, but Britain was brought to a\nboil this week over a suggestion by an American chemist on how the classic cup\nmight be improved. Malcolm Brabant has the story.\n\n### Why do tea plants produce caffeine?\n\n[Plants use] trashed pieces of DNA to make the caffeine, and then it uses it\nfor its own purpose, which is as a pesticide and an herbicide. So when the\nleaves fall around the plant, it kind of acts to keep other plants from\ngrowing. And it [makes the plant less] attractive to insects. If you think\nabout chewing on a bitter leaf, we wouldn\u2019t want to chew on a bitter leaf. And\nso this decreases pests both around the plant, as well as the ones that want\nto feast on the plant.\n\n### If people don\u2019t want a caffeine buzz, how can they decaffeinate tea at\nhome?\n\nIf you want to decaffeinate tea, you can [steep it for] 30 seconds, dump the\nwater and now resteep it. It\u2019ll taste a little flat because the caffeine has\ntaste \u2014 it\u2019s bitter. So it won\u2019t taste quite as good as a cup of tea with\ncaffeine in it. But if you want a cup of tea in the late afternoon and you\u2019re\nafraid it\u2019s going to keep you awake, that works. And for me, I like all these\ndifferent kinds of teas, and it lets me decaffeinate a tea that doesn\u2019t have a\ndecaffeinated version.\n\n### What are the steps to making the perfect cup of tea?\n\nThe very first thing you want to do is pre-warm the pot. So you want to fill\nyour pot or your mug up with hot water while you bring your water to a boil in\na kettle.\n\nThere are as many molecules in my cup of tea as there are stars in the\nuniverse.\n\nUse loose leaf tea in a big tea infuser [that has enough room for the tea to\nexpand]. I have this very prosaic basket that\u2019s roughly the size of the mug.\nAgitate the tea leaves, stir them with a spoon. I just bounce the infuser up\nand down, because you want all that contact between the solvent \u2014 the water \u2014\nand the tea leaves.\n\nTime it. I set a timer on my watch. Four minutes, pull it out. It gets a\nlittle more bitter, but [if you want a little bit] more of the antioxidants,\nsqueeze a little of the excess water out of the end. And to me, that\u2019s the\nperfect cup of tea.\n\n### What happens if you make tea using a microwave instead of a kettle?\n\n[A colleague] makes her tea [by] heating it up in the water in the microwave,\nand she wanted to know, why does it always get the white film on it? When she\nmakes it at home and boils it in the kettle, she doesn\u2019t get that. So I\nstarted [looking] around through the literature to discover it\u2019s called tea\nscum.\n\nWhat happens is when you boil it in the microwave, you don\u2019t get enough of the\noxygen out because it boils so fast. And so that helps to promote the\ndevelopment of tea scum. And the tea scum reduces the flavor, in addition to\njust kind of floating on the top of your cup, so you get a less flavorful cup.\nAnd it\u2019s just like the scum in bathtubs \u2014 it\u2019s positively charged ions and\norganic compounds.\n\nTo deal with it, you can use citric acid. The citrate in it will bind the ions\nand prevent the formation of the tea scum. So the same solution you would use\nin the bathtub \u2014 some kind of chelating agent \u2014 will work in the tea, too. A\nlittle squeeze of lemon.\n\n### When should you add milk, if you\u2019re so inclined?\n\n[Warming milk before adding it] helps to keep it from curdling. The proteins\nwill denature if you toss them into hot water, so if you warm them up a little\nbit, there\u2019s less thermal shock and the proteins are less likely to curdle.\n\nWarming milk can help prevent it from curdling when you pour it into a mug of\nhot tea. Photo via Getty Images\n\nIf you are brewing tea in a cup with a tea bag, you definitely don\u2019t want to\nadd the milk until the end, because you\u2019ll reduce the temperature of the water\nby putting in cold milk, and you reduce it enough to get less caffeine out.\n\n### Why shouldn\u2019t you reuse tea bags?\n\nBecause that caffeine comes out so fast. So after you\u2019ve used the bag and\ntaken it out, there is really not much caffeine left. You also lose lots of\nthe antioxidants. If you brew it a second time, you\u2019re getting no caffeine,\nreally \u2014 you\u2019re still getting some antioxidants. By the third time, what\nyou\u2019re getting is colored water.\n\n### What does adding a pinch of salt do for a cup of tea?\n\nI add the pinch of salt at the end, so after everything\u2019s all brewed and it\u2019s\nsitting in my mug. And the reason for doing that is if you want to moderate\nthe bitterness \u2014 it won\u2019t get rid of all the bitterness, but it will reduce\nit. If I\u2019ve let my tea brew a little too long and I\u2019ve gotten distracted, that\nwill help. The reason it works is the sodium ions in the salt block some of\nthe bitter receptors [on our tongues].\n\n\u201cThe Classic of Tea\u201d by Lu Yu, which is an 8th-century Chinese manuscript,\n[is] where the whole addition of salt thing comes from. Of course, they didn\u2019t\nknow about sodium ions and they didn\u2019t know about receptors, but they did know\nwhat made the tea taste good.\n\n### Has your research on tea changed the way you think about chemistry?\n\nIt\u2019s made me think about the scale of things. So, I have a part-time\nappointment at the Vatican Observatory. And there\u2019s something, to me, kind of\nawe-inspiring about [the fact that] there are as many molecules in my cup of\ntea as there are stars in the universe.\n\nSo that gives me a different perspective on chemistry. I think physics [has\nthe reputation of being] the kind of beautiful science, right? And a lot of\nthat comes from astronomy and looking at the stars. But I think that there\u2019s\nas much richness in that cup of tea as there is looking out at the night sky.\n\nLeft: Chemist Michelle Francl explores the science behind one of the world's\nfavorite beverages in her new book \"Steeped: The Chemistry of Tea.\" Photo via\nGetty Images\n\n## Related\n\n  * American chemist causes stir in Britain by suggesting salt can improve cup of tea\n\nBy Malcolm Brabant\n\n  * How climate change is throwing off key timing for wildflowers and trees in spring\n\nBy Richard B.
