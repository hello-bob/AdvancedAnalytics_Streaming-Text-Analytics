Located in the Greater Porto\narea, the 80m2 two-bedroom house was printed in just 18 hours. The printing\nexecution time serves as a powerful testament to the efficiency and speed that\n3D printing technology brings to the construction industry.\n\nPatrick Eichiner, CEO and Co-Founder of Havelar, said: \u201cMore than a printing\nor construction company, we promote Construction 2.0, which enables us to\ndeliver new complete houses in less than 2 months well below current market\nprices. We can deliver modern mid-market designed houses for just \u20ac1.500 per\nm2\u201d.\n\nThe wavy facade of Portugal's first 3D printed house demonstrates the\nunparalleled design flexibility that construction 3D printing technology\noffers.\n\nThe price offered by Havelar is a striking contrast to the Porto average of\n\u20ac3,104/m2, as indicated in the latest report by Portuguese National Statistics\nInstitute. This cost-effectiveness is primarily attributed to the optimized\nefficiency and swift project execution enabled by the innovative 3D printing\nconstruction technology.\n\nRodrigo Vilas-Boas, Co-Founder of Havelar, underlined the transformative\nnature of their business approach: \u201cWe want to team up with partners who see\nthemselves in building sustainable and accessible communities. With \u20ac150,000,\nit's possible for a young couple to have the home they've always dreamed of,\nin an area with good access and services\u201d.\n\nHavelar\u2019s ambitions go far further than just delivering contemporary designed\nhouses fast and at very competitive prices. With 3D construction printing\nconstruction waste is already reduced significantly, but by 2030 Havelar even\nhopes to reach carbon neutrality in its\u2019 operation via use of alternative\nbuilding materials like earth, sludge, slag, straw and other biomaterials.\n\nHenrik Lund-Nielsen, Founder & General Manager of COBOD commented on the large\naspirations of Havelar: \u201cWhen you are setting very ambitious goals, there is\nalways a risk, that these are not realized, but if you do not aim high, you\nwill reach nowhere. We are happy to support Havelar in their ambitious\nendeavors, our printers are open source when it comes to materials and can\nprint with many different types\u201d.\n\nCNN Reportage about Portugal's First 3D printed House\n\nThe inaugural Havelar house, a collaboration with renowned architects Aires\nMateus, Gl\u00f3ria Cabral, and Francis K\u00e9r\u00e9, is a showcase of what is achievable\nwith 3D construction printing technology.\n\n## RELEVANT LINKS\n\n  * Havelar website\n  * View the reportage from Porto channel\n  * Portuguese National Statistics Report On Housing Costs 2024\n  * RTP: watch the building being constructed live\n\nKEY SHAREHOLDERS\n\n#### Information\n\n  * Contact\n  * Careers\n  * About\n  * Privacy Policy\n\n## Technology\n\n  * Solution\n  * Projects & Customers\n  * Configurator\n  * FAQ\n\n## Newsletter sign up\n\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13\n\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13\n\nNotifications\n\n", "frontpage": true}
