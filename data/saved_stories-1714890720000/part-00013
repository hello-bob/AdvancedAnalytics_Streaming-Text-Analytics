I got word that long-time\nIndustrial Designer at Atari coin-operated division, Mike Jang, has passed\naway.\n\nI\u2019ve known Mike since 2016, and whilst we never met, he was always on the\nother end of an email answering my questions and providing really valuable\ninput into my articles here on the blog, and especially so for my book Missile\nCommander. Mike has always been approachable and happy to share his knowledge\nand deep insight into the industrial design processes at Atari.\n\nLearning his craft at San Jose State University, Mike joined Atari\u2019s\nIndustrial Design team during the mid 70s and remained there through the\neighties. This meant he was fortunate enough to witness the explosion of\nAtari\u2019s fortunes right through the Golden Age of arcade videogaming. He was\nright there in the engine room of Atari contributing to the coin-op division\u2019s\ngame output.\n\nAs an Industrial Designer, his main role was to refine the ergonomics of\narcade cabinets \u2013 he was a big advocate of making sure that the physical\ninterface players used to interact with Atari\u2019s game cabinets was just right;\nand if that meant bespoke controls, parts and mouldings were required, then he\nwould push the company to make it happen. He brought his own artistic flair to\nhis design work, creating some of the most iconic cabinets from the era.\n\nMike Jang at work here. I believe that was an unreleased kiosk of some kind,\nintended for installation at MacDonald\u2019s outlets across the USA. The project\nnever came to fruition\n\nIt is very easy to take for granted some of Atari\u2019s cabinet design choices,\nbut all were deeply thought through by Mike and his team, extensively tested\nand then produced \u2013 mostly in-house \u2013 resulting in the most varied portfolio\nof arcade cabinets ever produced by one manufacturer. Atari were the industry\nleaders in this regard by a country mile. Mike\u2019s work was extensive and he was\nresponsible for many of Atari\u2019s patents, made in his name.\n\nThis picture was taken in 1981. Mike is captured here discussing the design of\nAtari\u2019s Asteroids Deluxe cabinet with colleague Dave Cook:\n\nMike is on the right, discussing Asteroids Deluxe with fellow designer Dave\nCook at Atari\u2019s offices\n\nMike had the opportunity to fly to Atari Ireland to oversee the initial\nproduction of one his cabinets, Roadblasters. Whilst there, he shared these\nphotographs with me that he personally took at the Tipperary facility:\n\nMike\u2019s photographs of Asteroids Deluxe cabinets on the factory floor at Atari\nIreland. Click for larger images\n\nI documented in my book the extensive work that Mike put into the original\ndesign of the Missile Command prototype cabinet. He had this to say:\n\n> Arcade games were pre-CAD so we drew up the cabinet with drafting tables,\n> pencil, and paper. Each piece of wood or plastic was drawn and sent to the\n> engineering woodshop to be built. Metal parts went to another in house shop.\n> Everything was done inside our building so as to keep the game secret from\n> the competition.\n>\n> Extract from interview with Mike Jang discussing the industrial design\n> process at Atari\n\nThe workspace at Atari Industrial Design where Mike Jang worked in the 70s and\n80s\n\nMike sketched out the initial ideas for Missile Command, based on US military\nnuclear consoles \u2013 keeping the vibe relevant to the game\u2019s subject matter:\n\nMike Jang\u2019s initial sketch of his vision for the Missile Command cabinet\n\n> The first main goal is to build a game that is put out for testing. Usually\n> only one was built since one never knew if it will make mega bucks or no\n> bucks. If the first test goes good, we might build and test more. That was a\n> sales and marketing call. If it tested good, there would be a big push to go\n> into production as soon as possible. Reason being, unscrupulous companies\n> would spot a game on test and start making their own illegal copies. It\u2019s\n> better to get the game out and sell as many as possible before the copiers\n> showed up. That was more cost effective than going to court and sue.\n>\n> Extract from interview with Mike Jang discussing the industrial design\n> process at Atari\n\nMissile Command prototype cabinet\n\nWhen the original Missile Command cabinet came back from testing with negative\nfeedback about the large marquee, he went back to his design sketch and made a\npretty dramatic change:\n\nThe large marquee had to go! Notice the new red lines on this cabinet draft,\noutlining the proposed shape of the production version of Missile Command that\nwe are familiar with today\n\nAs you can see, a key part of Mikes job, was to provide solutions to problems\narising from creating arcade cabinets, testing hardware, either internally or\nout in the field, inevitably creates issues that will need fixing, requiring\nthe industrial design team to go back to the drawing board to amend their\ninitial creations. This would be a pretty thankless task as you can imagine,\nbut Mike was happy to oblige most requests.\n\n> I didn\u2019t interact with Mike Jang a great deal, but when I was doing\n> temperature testing of the games and found the temperature inside was too\n> high Mike didn\u2019t have a problem putting in a vent, sometimes an extra vent,\n> and sometimes a fan.\n>\n> Jed Margolin, Atari engineer and colleague\n\nHere are some more cabinet designs that Mike was responsible for during his\ntime at Atari:\n\nOne of Mike\u2019s earliest patented cabinet designs was Starship 1, released in\n1976. You can click these images for larger versions\n\nThe United States patent for the Hard Drivin\u2019 video game cabinet design\n\nAnother of Jang\u2019s creations was the Star Wars cockpit design\n\nI spoke to Mike about his work on the Star Wars cabinet, and he had this to\nsay:\n\n> I started the concepts for the Star Wars cabinet and later another designer\n> did more detailed work on the plastic part in front of the monitor. One of\n> the main elements I sketched up were the hydraulic ram shapes on the plastic\n> parts. Those rams were often seen in the movie, especially the ramp to the\n> Millennium Falcon. Also I wanted to continue the mechanical theme by adding\n> that truss style design to the sides of the roof. I was concerned because\n> that was a particle board part that was cut with an angled router bit. Then\n> the bare particle board was just painted black. I was worried about the wood\n> texture appearance but nobody noticed after everything else was put in\n> place.\n>\n> Mike Jang discussing Star Wars cabinet design\n\nAtari\u2019s Star Wars production cockpit cabinet\n\nAtari Stun Runner.

This was the cabinet\nthat Mike travelled to Atari Ireland to oversee during early production for\nthe European market. \u201cI went with Dave Cook to Ireland, we both had a project\nstarting in the Ireland factory. So we were sent to solve any problems that\nmight come up. They were sent the paper printouts of the cabinet parts to be\nmade. We visited the wood shop that was building the first proto RoadBlaster.\nThe cabinet looked great so we had no problems there\u201d\n\nA roofless cockpit driving cabinet \u2013 intended for use in an eventually shelved\nlaser disc game called Malibu Grand Prix\n\nAnother two games that spring to mind are Firefox, where Mike was responsible\nfor the control panel design, and Hydra which used one of Mike\u2019s full cabinet\nsketches.\n\nHis full discography of arcade cabinet design is too extensive to cover here,\nbut his work spanned almost two decades and was extremely varied as you can\nsee.\n\nPost Atari, Mike was big on Hot Rodding and took his design skills to mock up\ncar designs. Here is his 1951 Mercury coupe that he acquired in 1989 and spent\nmany hours meticulously customising. He still owned this car right up to his\npassing:\n\nMike\u2019s passion project \u2013 his customised 1951 Mercury coupe\n\nArcadeblogger.com is a richer experience thanks to Mike\u2019s input over the\nyears, and my book would be a lesser tome were it not for Mike\u2019s unique\nperspective and detail on the events leading up to, and after, the creation of\nthe prototype Missile Command cabinet.\n\nHere\u2019s a great shot of Mike, captured in 1979 demonstrating the size of\nAtari\u2019s Hercules pinball cabinet\n\nAlthough Mike is no longer with us, his design legacy does live on in some of\nthe fantastic looking arcade hardware he created \u2013 have a look out for these\nmachines next time you\u2019re at an arcade, and raise a glass when you play.\n\nOne of the things that Mike did recently, was to donate all of his old Atari\ndocuments for archiving at Stanford University. The Michael Jang collection of\nAtari materials, 1978-1991 can be accessed and viewed by researchers for years\nto come, which is great news.\n\nMike I\u2019m sure will be deeply missed by his Atari colleagues, who speak very\nhighly of him as a designer, but also a friend and person; and based on my\ninteractions with him, I would absolutely echo those sentiments here and send\ncondolences to his family and friends.\n\nI hope in a small way, this tribute highlights some of Mike\u2019s superb work.\n\nSee you next time.\n\nTony\n\n### Share this article!\n\n  * Tweet\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Email\n  * 7Save\n\nLike Loading...\n\narcadearcade historyatariAtari coin-opAtari Industrial DesignIndustrial\nDesignMichael JangMike JangMissile CommandNintendoplaystationretrogamingvideo\ngames\n\n## 10 Comments Add yours\n\n  1. cumminsnicky says:\n\nFebruary 13, 2024 at 19:41\n\nRip Mike Jang. I had the pleasure of working in Atari from 1981 to 1993. I\nworked in several departments from harness making to harness electrical\ntesting in QC dept. My most enjoyable job was testing a lot of those machines\nthat you often mention, before they were boxed and shipped. I have to say,\nwithout any doubt, the best years of my working life, and its great to hear\nyou mention them bringing back all those great days. I had the chance last\nyear to visit the factory again, and it was like going back in time! Very\nlittle has changed since I left, and I had a lump in my throat thinking of all\nthose people I worked with.\n\nLikeLiked by 3 people\n\n  2.

I worked with Mike on a number of projects.\nIncluding a few shown here like the \u201cKids Counter\u201d for MacDonalds as seen in\nthe first image, and Mailibu Grand Prix. The Kids Counter was a project to let\nkids pick the food they wanted on an device that hung over the counter front\nat their height, and when parents agreed, it could be entered for an order,\nand then it dispense a coin for the kid. Was a cool project.\n\nRest in Peace Mike.\n\nLikeLiked by 3 people\n\n  4. tthurman says:\n\nFebruary 14, 2024 at 02:52\n\nVery sorry to hear.\n\nThis post was a nice tribute to Mike and his work!\n\nLikeLiked by 2 people\n\n  5.

It was fun, sadly, the game did not work as well.\n\nLikeLiked by 1 person\n\n  8. mattbryant808 says:\n\nFebruary 16, 2024 at 18:21\n\nWhat an amazing legacy of design he leaves behind. Mike\u2019s work, along with\nthat of Cliff Spohn, Susan Jaekel and George Opperman, gives me ALL the feels\nof my 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s childhood wonderment of video games.\n\nLikeLiked by 1 person\n\n  9. mpbcollection says:\n\nFebruary 20, 2024 at 16:41\n\nSorry to hear of Mike\u2019s passing. My condolences to his family and friends.\n\nThough Atari is my favorite game company of all time, there is no question\nAtari has / had many outstanding cabinets and artwork designs. Mike\u2019s work and\nlegacy lives on in the many great cabinets he helped design and create.\n\nMichael P. B.\n\nLikeLiked by 1 person\n\n  10.

Sincerely.\n\nLikeLiked by 1 person\n\n### Leave a comment\n\n  * Comment\n  * Reblog\n  * Subscribe Subscribed\n\n    * The Arcade Blogger\n    * Already have a WordPress.com account?
