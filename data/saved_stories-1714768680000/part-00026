While at it, we also undeleted IA-64 Itanium\nsupport! ;-)\n\nA total of 36 pre-compiled base install ISOs for various Glibc, Musl and\nuClibc combinations are available for for 25 CPU ISAs: Alpha, Arc, ARM(64),\nAvr32, HPPA(64), IA64, Loongarch64, M68k, Microblaze, MIPS(64), Nios2,\nOpenRISC, PowerPC(64), RISCV(64), s390x, SPARC(64), SuperH, i486, i686, x86-64\nand x32. On most architectures the release still boots with 512MB of RAM or\neven less, and are on average just one GB in size. Most vintage Xorg drivers\nwere fixed to actually work again. The rolling release is updated using the\nscripted source build system and thus optimized for the native system CPU.\n\nThe release contains a total of 5140 changesets, including approximately 5314\npackage updates, 564 issues fixed, 317 packages or features added and 163\nremoved. Around 53 improvements. More details can be found on the release page\n\nDon't delay and try highly optimized T2/Linux today!\n\n## Doubling down on IA-64 Itanium support\n\n2023-12-05\n\nWith the recently announced removal of support for IA-64 from the upstream\nLinux kernel, we would like to stress that the reports of death of this EPIC\narchitecture are greatly exaggerated.\n\nDue to the ease of T2's cross compiling, as well as support and interest by\nthe OpenSource community, we are committed to support IA-64 for at least\nanother decade or two.\n\nIf anything, the upstream removal only sparked increased interest in T2 on\nItanium support and brought an influx of new developers with IA-64 based\nmachines. If you have highly reliable, explicit parallel IA-64 computers in\nproduction, don't delay and try and support highly optimized T2 Linux today!\n\n## Dark theme and more\n\n2023-08-28\n\nOnce a hacker niche now mainstream, and we could not escape it anymore: the\nDark Theme! Accompanied by our new glowing T2 logo!!\n\nKeeping this pace, we did a long awaited refactor on the website's backend\nthat will allow us keep making incremental changes to it with ease in the\nfuture. Who knows, maybe a complete design overhaul some day?\n\nArticle titles on the main page can now be clicked to highlight the article\nitself, which also gives you a nice link to share links directly pointing to\nthe chosen article. For example the one you are currently reading\nhttps://t2sde.org/#news-2023-08-28\n\nWhile at it, we finally added an RSS feed for the main page, too! Which truly\nhelps to keep an eye on what is going in the open T2 world without having to\nconstantly open a web browser daily to check for news.\n\n## Build time estimation\n\n2023-07-31\n\nTe are really happy to announce that, as of revision 64292, the T2 build\nscripts estimate and display how time time a package will likely require to\nbuild!\n\nOf course if works for Emerge-Pkg as well as Build-Target.\n\nThis is a game changer for many users with different, especially older systems\nand especially when testing on multiple different, exotic, vintage and retro\nRISC machines with varying levels of performance and allows us to better\norganize around long builds!\n\nThis feature is based on binutils reference time units which were gathered for\na really, really long time in T2 package's .cache.\n\nWe tried to make it as accurate as possible, but of course some variations,\nespecially for packages not utilizing multiple parallel threads during\ncompilation are to be expected.\n\nThe T2 core developers updated a massive amount of .cache files to make this\nas accurate as possible.\n\nAnd last but not least, we did benchmarks on multiple boards to give people an\noverview of what their hardware is capable of, which you can find under\n\"Performance Index\" on individual hardware reference page. See for example the\nMango Pi MQ-Pro D1 T2 hardware page.\n\nWe hope you like this new feature, because we for sure do!\n\n## Intel hardware decoding\n\n2023-07-06\n\nWe are happy to announce that T2, as of r63868, officially supports hardware\nvideo encoding and decoding with Intel discrete GPUs (aka ARC/DG2).\n\nTL;DR: ./scripts/Emerge-Pkg -force intel-onevpl ffmpeg mpv\n\nIt required 40 hours of mostly nighttime work to put everything together but\nwe finally did it.\n\nHere are all the packages you need to operate your hardware en/decoder:\n\n  * libva\n  * onevpl\n  * intel-media-driver\n  * intel-gmmlib\n  * intel-onevpl\n  * ffmpeg to encode or decode AV1 files\n  * A video player like mpv or vlc (or a web browser) to watch AV1 content\n\nExample command: ffmpeg -hwaccel qsv -c:v vp9_qsv -i input.webm -c:v av1_qsv\n-b:v 5M -look_ahead 1 output.webm\n\nAs an added bonus you also get H264, HEVC and VP9 hardware support!\n\nAs usual, patches welcome! Let us know if it actually works for your DG1 or Xe\ngraphics too!\n\n## 32-bit Rustc and more big-endian\n\n2023-05-05\n\nThe last couple of days we spent fixing rustc support for sparc32, notably the\nelf format which isn't working upstream as well as more RISCV(32) as well as\nbig-endian ARM fixes!\n\nNext release will then come with rustc, cargo and hopefully firefox which\nrequires a more fixes at the time of writing.\n\nAs usual, patches welcome if you found something not yet working perfectly on\nthis older, or embedded systems!\n\n## Complete system encryption\n\n2023-02-18\n\nIn the past few weeks, we've been hard at work to improve user convenience\nwhen setting a fully encrypted T2 installation.\n\nOur installer already supported full-disk encryption, including encrypted boot\npartitions which you unlock with Grub at boot time since 2020 (r50723). But\nuntil now we were missing a crucial feature for easier data management without\nbeing locked with one partition scheme unless doing a clean install: LVM\ninside LUKS.\n\nAs of today, we are proud to announce that we integrated support for booting\nLUKS+LVM! We even added support for encrypted swap/suspend-to-disk to complete\nthe security chain so that you can shutdown you PC without closing everything\nyou were working on and worry about someone running out with your drive and\ndumping the content of your swap partition in case your computer is stored in\na public space.\n\nEverything is integrated in Stone which you will be able to experiment by\nyourself when we release 23.2 ISO images.\n\nRebooting from the installed to the new system is now faster than ever,\ncourtesy of the kexec mechanism that was added in r60600 (r59937, 60059,\n60458, 60468, and more that fixed cross-compiling!). Meaning you can now\ndeploy T2 on your server without having time to make coffee before it reboots!\n\nOf course everything is already available in the current subversion\nrepository! If you have an already existing T2 install make sure to upgrade\nthe following packages before testing anything: grub2, linux, mkinitrd, stone,\nutil-linux.\n\nA typical LUKS+LVM+suspend-to-disk setup would look like so:\n\n    \n    \n    NAME FSTYPE TYPE MOUNTPOINTS sda disk \u251c\u2500sda1 vfat part /boot/efi \u2514\u2500sda2 crypto_LUKS part \u2514\u2500toor crypt \u251c\u2500qvo-swap whatever lvm [SWAP] \u251c\u2500qvo-root whatever lvm / \u251c\u2500qvo-boot whatever lvm /boot \u2514\u2500qvo-home whatever lvm /home\n\nYou can watch parts of that work on youtube:\n\n  * Better and easier full-disk, swap and LVM encrypted Linux installation\n  * Encrypted LVM storage, kexec reboot & more\n\nNext steps for us will be to have sensible defaults suggestions at partition\ntime for user convenience and then rewrite (hopefully soon) a graphical\nversion of the installer.\n\nAs always, patches welcome! Come chat with us on the interwebs!\n\n## T2 22.9 \"TOP SECRET\"\n\n2022-09-02\n\nToday T2 SDE Linux 22.9 was released.

Approximately\n1918 packages got updates, 122 issues fixed, 1918 packages or features added\nand 47 removed. Around 15 improvements have been committed.\n\n## T2 22.6 \"R\u00e9sistance\"\n\n2022-07-17\n\nToday T2 SDE Linux 22.6 was released. A major milestone update to ship full\nsupport for 25 CPU architectures, variants, and C libraries. Of course all the\narchitectures, including: alpha, arc, arm, arm64, avr32, hppa, ia64, m68k,\nmipsel, mips64, nios2, ppc, ppc64-32, ppc64le, riscv, riscv64, s390x, sparc,\nsparc64, superh, x86, x86-64 and x32 can be rolling release updated thru the\nscripted build system from source \u2013 optimized to the native system.\n\nThe 22.6 release received updates across the board, with latest stable Linux\nkernel 5.17.15, GCC12, LLVM/Clang 14 and the latest of KDE, GNOME and much\nmore.\n\nThere were 5014 change-sets with 6334 lines of commit messages. Approximately\n4947 packages got updates, 331 issues fixed, 4947 packages or features added\nand 148 removed. Around 49 improvements have been committed.\n\n## T2 feature patch bounty program\n\n2021-11-28\n\nThe T2 SDE project is thrilled to announce ExactCODE GmbH sponsoring features\nbounties for selected feature requests. We believe OpenSource developers\nshould be fairly paid for their tremendous infrastructure work that most of\nthe Internet, mobile and embedded platforms are based on nowadays. We are\nhappy to set a good example and T2 being one of the first project that gives\nback and pays their contributors.\n\n## T2 ported Firefox to RISCV64\n\n2021-11-05\n\nToday the T2 System Development Environment team is happy to share the latest\nFirefox working on RISCV64 Linux desktop! While this is a huge step for\ngeneral RISCV desktop and mobile usability more work remain, e.g. to port the\nJavaScript JIT to RISCV, too.\n\n## 53220 revisions, 4004 packages, and 20+ years of history\n\n2021-09-19\n\nWe are proud to announce that T2 SDE Linux reached over 4000, largely cross-\ncompiling packages for over 20 architectures. As an added bonus, you can\nnowadays often follow the development live on YouTube!\n\nEnjoy playing along on your devices at home and we hope you learn something\n;-)\n\nOlder news ...\n\nLast modified: 2024-04-29 18:18 \u2014 Copyright \u00a92004-2023 ExactCODE and others.\nAll Rights Reserved.
