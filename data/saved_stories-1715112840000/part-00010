However, the\ndevelopment of practical Ca metal batteries has been severely hampered by the\ncurrent cathode chemistries, which limit the available energy and power\ndensities, as well as their insufficient capacity retention and low-\ntemperature capability. Here, we describe the rechargeable Ca/Cl_2 battery\nbased on a reversible cathode redox reaction between CaCl_2 and Cl_2, which is\nenabled by the use of lithium difluoro(oxalate)borate as a key electrolyte\nmediator to facilitate the dissociation and distribution of Cl-based species\nand Ca^2+. Our rechargeable Ca/Cl_2 battery can deliver discharge voltages of\n3 V and exhibits remarkable specific capacity (1000 mAh g^\u22121) and rate\ncapability (500 mA g^\u22121). In addition, the excellent capacity retention (96.5%\nafter 30 days) and low-temperature capability (down to 0 \u00b0C) allow us to\novercome the long-standing bottleneck of rechargeable Ca metal batteries.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Monocarborane cluster as a stable fluorine-free calcium battery\nelectrolyte\n\nArticle Open access 06 April 2021\n\n### Calcium-tin alloys as anodes for rechargeable non-aqueous calcium-ion\nbatteries at room temperature\n\nArticle Open access 04 July 2022\n\n### A rechargeable calcium\u2013oxygen battery that operates at room temperature\n\nArticle 07 February 2024\n\n## Introduction\n\nModern electrification has witnessed the ever-growing demand for rechargeable\nbatteries with high sustainability and energy storage capabilities^1,2,3,4.\nRechargeable calcium (Ca) metal batteries are among the most promising\ncandidates because of their advantageous features, such as high crustal\nabundance, high theoretical capacity, and ideal redox potential^5,6,7.\nHowever, compared with the conventional Li counterparts, current Ca metal\nbatteries based on intercalation/deintercalation cathodes, such as metal\noxides, suffer from relatively limited electrochemical performance, e.g., low\nspecific capacities (<200 mAh g^\u22121), discharge voltages (<2.6 V), and rate\ncapability (<100 mA g^\u22121)^8,9,10,11, which requires the development of new\ncathode reactions to overcome these limitations on electrochemical\nperformance. In addition, the capacity retention and low-temperature\nperformance of Ca metal batteries remain inaccessible to date, due to the\ninferior electrochemical stability and sluggish cathode/anode reaction\nkinetics. Therefore, it is crucial yet challenging to develop new cathode\nchemistry to realize practical applications of rechargeable Ca metal\nbatteries^12,13,14.\n\nReversible CaCl_2/Cl_2 redox reaction is among the most attractive cathode\nreactions for Ca metal batteries, enabling the delivery of high specific\ncapacities (483 mAh g^\u22121 based on the mass of CaCl_2) at discharge voltages of\n3 V. However, it is currently unavailable so far, owing to the challenging\ncontrol of Ca-based electrolytes and the generated electrolyte/electrode\ninterfaces^3. On the cathode side, for instance, the strong electrostatic\nforce of Ca^2+ is prone to inhibit its efficient dissociation and distribution\nin the electrolyte^15,16, making the desired CaCl_2/Cl_2 cathode conversion\nthermodynamically and kinetically unfavorable. On the anode side, the high\nreactivity of Ca metal requires rational regulation of electrolyte solvation\nto ensure high electrochemical reversibility^17,18. Therefore, it is desired\nbut challenging for electrolyte designing and screening to unlock reversible\nCaCl_2/Cl_2 redox reactions for practical Ca metal batteries.\n\nHere, we show that reversible CaCl_2/Cl_2 redox reaction can be fully unlocked\nin Ca metal batteries using a CaCl_2\u2013AlCl_3\u2013SOCl_2 electrolyte regulated by a\nlithium difluoro(oxalate)borate (LiDFOB) mediator. LiDFOB has been\ndemonstrated to facilitate the dissociation and distribution of Cl-based\nspecies and Ca^2+, thus allowing the CaCl_2/Cl_2 redox reaction. Our\nrechargeable Ca/Cl_2 battery demonstrates discharge voltages of 3 V and\nremarkable specific capacity (up to 1000 mAh g^\u22121) and rate capability (up to\n500 mA g^\u22121) because of the fast kinetics of the CaCl_2/Cl_2 redox reaction.\nIn addition, the shelf life (>30 days) and low-temperature performance (down\nto 0 \u00b0C) achieved by this battery overcome the long-standing bottlenecks that\nhave plagued the practical application of rechargeable Ca metal batteries. Our\nresults provide a new paradigm for bridging Cl-based cathode and multivalent\nmetal anode chemistry to achieve sustainable and high-performance energy\nstorage.\n\n## Results\n\nTo develop a rechargeable Ca/Cl_2 battery, we used a graphite cathode and a Ca\nmetal anode coupled with a Cl-based electrolyte composed of CaCl_2, AlCl_3,\nand LiDFOB salts in SOCl_2 (named CALS electrolyte) (Fig. 1a and Supplementary\nFig. 1; see preparation details in \u201cMethods\u201d). This rechargeable Ca/Cl_2\nbattery delivered a high reversible specific capacity of 1000 mAh g^\u22121 and a\nhigh discharge voltage of more than 3 V (Fig. 1b), making it highly\ncompetitive compared with state-of-the-art cathodes used in Ca metal\nbatteries, e.g., metal oxides^19, sulfur^20, and oxygen^21 (Fig. 1c and\nSupplementary Fig. 2).\n\nFig. 1: Rechargeable Ca/Cl_2 battery based on a Cl-based electrolyte mediated\nby LiDFOB.\n\na Schematic illustration of a rechargeable Ca/Cl_2 battery based on a graphite\ncathode, a Ca metal anode, and a CALS electrolyte composed of a mixture of\nCaCl_2, AlCl_3, and LiDFOB dissolved in SOCl_2. b Galvanostatic\ncharge\u2013discharge curve of the rechargeable Ca/Cl_2 battery. The specific\ncharge capacity and current density are 1000 mAh g^\u22121 and 100 mA g^\u22121,\nrespectively. c Comparison of the reversible specific capacity and discharge\nvoltage of the rechargeable Ca/Cl_2 battery with those of other representative\nbatteries with Ca cathodes, e.g., manganese dioxide^19, sulfur^20, and\noxygen^21. All specific capacities were based on the mass of the active\nmaterials on the cathode. A comparison of the areal capacities was also\nprovided in Supplementary Fig. 2.\n\nFull size image\n\nNotably, CaCl_2 was in-situ formed on the graphite cathode during the first\ndischarge of the battery, as shown in Eq. (1), and could stably exist at the\ncathode because the dissolution of CaCl_2 in the electrolyte has reached\nsaturation. At the anode, the stripping of Ca metal occurred as described in\nEq. (2). The overall reaction during the first discharge was described in Eq.\n(3). A specific capacity of 3,264 mAh g^\u22121 (based on the mass of graphite here\nand throughout this paper) was delivered with a discharge voltage of ~2.8 V at\n100 mA g^\u22121 (Supplementary Fig. 3). The formation of SO_2 was verified by\ndifferential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS, Supplementary Fig. 4).\n\n$${{{{{\\rm{Cathode}}}}}}:\\,2{{{{{{\\rm{SOCl}}}}}}}_{2}+2{{{{{{\\rm{Ca}}}}}}}^{2+}+4{{{{{{\\rm{e}}}}}}}^{-}\\to\n2{{{{{{\\rm{CaCl}}}}}}}_{2}+{{{{{\\rm{S}}}}}}+{{{{{{\\rm{SO}}}}}}}_{2}$$\n\n(1)\n\n$${{{{{\\rm{Anode}}}}}}:\\,2{{{{{\\rm{Ca}}}}}}-4{{{{{{\\rm{e}}}}}}}^{-}\\to\n2{{{{{{\\rm{Ca}}}}}}}^{2+}$$\n\n(2)\n\n$${{{{{\\rm{Overall}}}}}}:\\,2{{{{{\\rm{Ca}}}}}}+2{{{{{{\\rm{SOCl}}}}}}}_{2}\\to\n2{{{{{{\\rm{CaCl}}}}}}}_{2}+{{{{{\\rm{S}}}}}}+{{{{{{\\rm{SO}}}}}}}_{2}$$\n\n(3)\n\nThe formed CaCl_2 on the graphite cathode was then oxidized to Cl_2 during the\nsubsequent charge step and reduced back to CaCl_2 during discharge according\nto Eq. (4), while the deposition and stripping process of Ca metal at the\nanode was shown in Eq. (5), resulting in a high discharge plateau at ~3.5 V\n(Fig. 1b). The overall reaction of the subsequent charging and discharging\nprocesses was shown in Eq. (6). A minor discharge plateau was observed at ~2\nV, which might correspond to the reduction of other charge products, such as\nSO_2Cl_2^22.\n\n$${{{{{\\rm{Cathode}}}}}}:\\,{{{{{{\\rm{CaCl}}}}}}}_{2}-2{{{{{{\\rm{e}}}}}}}^{-}\\leftrightarrow\n{{{{{{\\rm{Ca}}}}}}}^{2+}{+{{{{{\\rm{Cl}}}}}}}_{2}$$\n\n(4)\n\n$${{{{{\\rm{Anode}}}}}}:\\,{{{{{{\\rm{Ca}}}}}}}^{2+}+2{{{{{{\\rm{e}}}}}}}^{-}\\leftrightarrow\n{{{{{\\rm{Ca}}}}}}$$\n\n(5)\n\n$${{{{{\\rm{Overall}}}}}}:\\,{{{{{{\\rm{CaCl}}}}}}}_{2}\\leftrightarrow\n{{{{{\\rm{Ca}}}}}}+{{{{{{\\rm{Cl}}}}}}}_{2}$$\n\n(6)\n\nWe found that LiDFOB played a key role in enabling the rechargeability of the\nCa/Cl_2 battery. For instance, the battery prepared with a LiDFOB-free\nelectrolyte did not deliver any charge/discharge capacity, and no plateau was\nobserved, in stark contrast to the pronounced charge/discharge behavior\nobserved in the presence of LiDFOB (Fig. 2a), which inspired us to investigate\nthe origin of the rechargeability of our Ca/Cl_2 battery. We hypothesized that\nthe unique chemical structure of DFOB^\u2212 with two B\u2212F and two C=O functional\ngroups could effectively mediate the dissociation and distribution of Cl-based\nspecies (e.g., AlCl_3 and SOCl_2) and Ca^2+, thus facilitating their\nimmigration and improving the kinetics of the redox reaction (Fig. 2b). To\ntest this hypothesis, we acquired Raman spectra of different electrolytes\n(Fig. 2c). The spectrum of bare SOCl_2 showed peaks attributed to the\ncharacteristic symmetric Cl\u2212S\u2212Cl deformation (\u03b4_s(Cl\u2212S\u2212Cl), 342.8 cm^\u22121),\nasymmetric S\u2212Cl stretching (\u03bd_a(S\u2212Cl), 441.1 cm^\u22121) and symmetric S\u2212Cl\nstretching (\u03bd_s(S\u2212Cl), 487.7 cm^\u22121) vibrations^23,24. The addition of AlCl_3\nresulted in two new peaks at 384.9 and 524.6 cm^\u22121, corresponding to the\nformation of Cl_2SO^...AlCl_3 adducts. Subsequent addition of CaCl_2 showed\ntwo new Raman peaks at 363.8 and 504.5 cm^\u22121, which could be attributed to the\nCa\u2212O vibration (Ca^2+...SOCl_2). In addition, the coordination peaks of\n\u03bd(Al\u2212O) and \u03bd(S\u2212Cl) were redshifted and weakened, indicating a weakened\ninteraction between AlCl_3 and SOCl_2. Further introduction of DFOB^\u2212\nsignificantly changed the Raman profile. On the one hand, the Al\u2212O stretching\nvibration peak significantly redshifted from 382.6 to 376.9 cm^\u22121 with a\nsignificant intensity decrease. On the other hand, the coordination S\u2212Cl\nstretching (AlCl_3^...SOCl_2) peak at 524.6 cm^\u22121 almost disappeared,\nconfirming the sufficient dissociation between AlCl_3 and SOCl_2 mediated by\nDFOB^\u2212. This evidence indicated that the introduction of DFOB^\u2212 could\neffectively facilitate the dissociation of the strong interaction between\nAlCl_3 and SOCl_2, thus enabling reversible and fast CaCl_2/Cl_2 redox\nreaction. In addition, the solvation structure of the CALS electrolyte\nremained almost unchanged before and after gelation, as verified by the highly\nconsistent Raman spectra in Supplementary Fig. 5. Thermogravimetric analysis\nand differential scanning calorimetry tests indicate that the gelation of CALS\nelectrolyte may be related to the intermolecular interaction between different\nsubstances such as Ca^2+ and DFOB^\u2212 (Supplementary Fig. 6)^25,26.\n\nFig. 2: \u201cDissociation\u2013distribution\u201d effect of LiDFOB in a CALS electrolyte.\n\na Galvanostatic charge\u2013discharge curves of rechargeable Ca/Cl_2 batteries\nusing a CALS electrolyte with and without LiDFOB.

We performed molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations to investigate the solvation structure of Ca^2+ mediated by DFOB^\u2212\n(Fig. 2d\u2013g; see details in the Methods of Supplementary Information), which\nwas further confirmed by the Ca K-edge X-ray absorption spectra (XAS)\n(Supplementary Fig. 7). In the absence of DFOB^\u2212, the solvation shell of Ca^2+\nions was only composed of Cl-based species such as Cl^\u2212 and AlCl_4^\u2212(Fig. 2d,\ne). In contrast, the introduction of DFOB^\u2212 resulted in the formation of a new\nCa^2+\u2013DFOB^\u2212 ion pair, which significantly improved the distribution of Ca^2+,\nas observed in the MD simulation snapshots (Fig. 2f, g). This was attributed\nto C=O^...Ca^2+ and B\u2212F^...Ca^2+ coordination originating from the unique\nchemical structure of DFOB^\u2212 (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 8). Radial\ndistribution functions (RDFs) further confirmed the role of DFOB^\u2212 in the\nsolvation structure. The Ca^2+\u2013DFOB^\u2212 ion pair distance (2.63 \u00c5) was smaller\nthan that of Ca^2+\u2013Cl^\u2212 (3.62 \u00c5) (Fig. 2h, i), indicating that DFOB^\u2212\nparticipated in a stronger interaction with Ca^2+ that could compete with the\ninteraction between Ca^2+ and Cl-based species, thus improving their\ndistribution (Fig. 2j). In addition, the interactions of AlCl_4^\u2212\u2013SOCl^+ and\nCl^\u2212\u2013Cl^\u2212 were both weakened in the presence of DFOB^\u2212 (Supplementary Figs 9\nand 10), which was in good agreement with the decreased intensity of the Al\u2212O\nand S\u2212Cl vibration peaks in the Raman spectra (Fig. 2c). Mean square\ndisplacement (MSD) calculations showed that the Ca^2+ migration rate increased\n5-fold after the introduction of DFOB^\u2212 (1.21 \u00d7 10^\u22126 vs. 0.24 \u00d7 10^\u22126 cm^2\ns^\u22121) (Fig. 2k), which was consistent with the trend of ion diffusion\ncoefficient in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Supplementary\nFig. 11). Notably, the possibility that Li ions were responsible for the\nincreased conductivity or decreased impedance could be ruled out, based on the\ncomparison of ionic conductivity and Nyquist plot based on the\nCaCl_2/AlCl_3/SOCl_2 electrolyte with and without LiCl (see details in\nSupplementary Fig. 11). Therefore, the improved Ca^2+ distribution and ion\ndissociation mediated by DFOB^\u2212 were verified to benefit the rechargeability\nof our Ca/Cl_2 batteries.\n\nUnderstanding cathode chemistry has important implications for improving\nbattery performance. We thus analyzed the cathode reaction products at a\nvariety of charge/discharge states (Fig. 3a\u2013c). After the first discharge of\nthe battery, the formation of CaCl_2, SO_2, and S was verified by X-ray\nphotoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), consistent with Eq. (1) (Supplementary Fig.\n12). The subsequent charge step, which corresponded to the conversion from\nCaCl_2 to Cl_2, exposed the edges of the graphite flakes (Fig. 3b and\nSupplementary Fig. 13), and the following discharge resulted in the formation\nof CaCl_2 nanoflakes on the graphite (Fig. 3c). The high-resolution\ntransmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron\ndiffraction (SAED) profiles further confirmed the formation of CaCl_2 after\nthe first discharge (Fig. 3d). X-ray diffraction (XRD) also revealed the\nformation and removal of CaCl_2 on graphite at the fully discharged and\ncharged states, respectively (Fig. 3e). An air-isolating chamber was used to\navoid hygroscopicity of CaCl_2, and the weak CaCl_2 peaks could be still\nobserved at the fully charged state because not all the CaCl_2 on cathode was\nconsumed due to a limited charge capacity of 500 mAh g^\u22121. We suppose that\nLi^+ does not play a critical role in the rechargeability of Ca/Cl_2\nbatteries, as verified by the battery performance based on the\nCaCl_2/AlCl_3/SOCl_2 electrolyte with the addition of LiCl, which could not\ndeliver any charge/discharge capacity or plateau (Supplementary Fig. 14).\n\nFig. 3: Cathode product analysis of rechargeable Ca/Cl_2 batteries.\n\na Galvanostatic charge\u2013discharge curves of a rechargeable Ca/Cl_2 battery\nusing the CALS electrolyte. b, c SEM images of the graphite cathode at the\nfully charged and discharged states, respectively.

(1)^27 (Fig. 3f, g). The formation\nand consumption of Cl_2 during battery charge and discharge were detected by\nDEMS (Fig. 3h). The high-resolution Cl 2p XPS spectra further confirmed the\nformation of Cl_2/C\u2013Cl bond at the fully charged cathode^28,29 (Fig. 3i, j).\nIn addition, the Ca/Cl_2 pouch cell showed no significant volume change at the\nfully charged state, which suggested that the generated Cl_2 might be\nadsorbed/trapped within the graphite cathode (Supplementary Fig. 15). These\nsystematic characterizations of the cathode products confirmed the\nreversibility of the CaCl_2/Cl_2 redox reaction in our rechargeable Ca/Cl_2\nbatteries.\n\nOur CALS electrolyte also improves the electrochemical stability of the Ca\nmetal anode, which is important for battery rechargeability^30,31. For\ninstance, Ca metal that was immersed in CALS electrolyte without DFOB^\u2212 became\ndark immediately, whereas the surface remained shiny in CALS electrolyte with\nDFOB^\u2212 (Supplementary Fig. 16a, b). The XPS profile also showed metallic Al on\nCa in the electrolyte without DFOB^\u2212, indicating that DFOB^\u2212 could suppress\nthe parasitic reaction between AlCl_4^\u2212 and Ca metal, thus preventing the\nreplacement of Al metal that inhibited Ca^2+ transfer across the\nelectrode/electrolyte interface (Supplementary Fig. 16c). The high-resolution\nF 1 s XPS spectra of the Ca metal anode after the first discharge showed a B-F\npeak at ~686.6 eV, which was preserved after 40 cycles (Supplementary Fig.\n17). It could be assigned to DFOB^\u2212 which was adsorbed on the surface of Ca\nmetal, and its strong interaction with Ca^2+ could weaken the interaction\nbetween Ca^2+ and Cl^\u2212, which suppressed the parasitic chlorination of the Ca\nmetal anode, thus promoting the electrochemical reversibility (Supplementary\nFig. 18). Additionally, DFOB^\u2212 decomposition and Li deposition on the Ca metal\nanode might not occur, as suggested by the B 1 s and Li 1 s spectra\n(Supplementary Fig. 17).\n\nWe further verified the reversible morphological evolution of the Ca metal\nanode at a variety of charge/discharge states, without observation of \u2018dead\u2019\nor dendritic Ca metal (Supplementary Figs. 19 and 20). The formation of CaCl_2\non the surface of the Ca metal anode was verified by the Ca 2p and Cl 2p XPS\nspectra (Supplementary Fig. 16). In a Ca/Au half cell containing a CALS\nelectrolyte, the reversibility of Ca metal plating and stripping was\ndetermined to be 90.2% by cyclic voltammetry (Supplementary Fig. 21a). In\ncontrast, in the CALS electrolyte without DFOB^\u2212, no stripping behavior was\nobserved (Supplementary Fig. 21b), which confirmed the critical role of DFOB^\u2212\nin the rechargeability of the Ca/Cl_2 battery. The scanning electron\nmicroscopy (SEM) and XRD results showed the uniform deposition of Ca metal on\nthe Au foil in the presence of our CALS electrolyte (Supplementary Fig. 22).\nThese results suggested that the parasitic reaction between the Ca metal anode\nand the electrolyte was suppressed, as mediated by LiDFOB, which is critical\nfor the rechargeability of our Ca/Cl_2 battery.\n\nWe further investigated the electrochemical performance of our rechargeable\nCa/Cl_2 battery. It demonstrated high electrochemical reversibility over a\nvariety of specific capacities ranging from 200 to 1000 mAh g^\u22121 (Fig. 4a), as\nwell as an impressive rate capability of 500 mA g^\u22121 (Fig. 4b), demonstrating\nthe fast kinetics of the CaCl_2/Cl_2 redox reaction. We also verified the high\ncycling stability of our rechargeable Ca/Cl_2 battery over 100 cycles, whereas\nno rechargeability was observed when using the LiDFOB-free electrolyte (Fig.\n4c). We sought to translate the impressive electrochemical performance into\npractical Ca metal batteries. For instance, retention performance (shelf life)\nis a critical parameter that determines the practical use of a battery^32. To\nthe best of our knowledge, however, current Ca metal batteries cannot afford\nsufficient retention capability, owing to the poor electrochemical stability\nof both electrodes used in conventional Ca-based electrolytes^33. Our Ca/Cl_2\nbattery demonstrated remarkable retention capability, e.g., when maintained in\na fully charged state for 1, 3, and 5 days, the rechargeability was well\nretained (Fig. 4d), indicating the high electrochemical stability of the\ncharging product in our Ca/Cl_2 battery. For an as-prepared battery held at\nthe open-circuit voltage for 30 days, 96.5% of the original specific capacity\nwas retained, and highly consistent charge\u2013discharge profiles and impedances\nwere observed (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 23). These results suggested\nthat our Ca/Cl_2 battery exhibited excellent retention performance in various\ncharge/discharge states, which is highly attractive for practical\napplications.\n\nFig. 4: Electrochemical performance of the rechargeable Ca/Cl_2 batteries.\n\na Galvanostatic charge\u2013discharge curves of a rechargeable Ca/Cl_2 battery\nusing the CALS electrolyte with various specific charge capacities of 200,\n500, and 1000 mAh g^\u22121.

The specific charge\ncapacity and current density in c\u2013g are 200 mAh g^\u22121 and 100 mA g^\u22121,\nrespectively.\n\nFull size image\n\nThe solid-state CALS electrolyte enables the production of separator-free\nCa/Cl_2 batteries, which can effectively reduce the volume and weight of\nbatteries for practical applications (Fig. 4f). In addition, the high ionic\nconductivities of our CALS electrolyte (e.g., 3.6 and 5.3 mS cm^\u22121 at 0 and 25\n\u00b0C, respectively) allow us to explore low-temperature battery performance,\nwhich remains a major challenge for current Ca metal batteries. Remarkably,\nour Ca/Cl_2 battery functioned normally at 0 \u00b0C, retaining ~92.2% of its room-\ntemperature energy efficiency (Fig. 4g), thus revealing fast ion transfer and\nreaction kinetics even at low temperatures. In addition, the high cycling\nstability was well maintained at 0 \u00b0C (Supplementary Fig. 24). To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first rechargeable Ca metal battery with acceptable\nlow-temperature capability to date^11,34,35, which represents an important\nstep toward practical application.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn conclusion, we report the rechargeable Ca/Cl_2 battery based on the\nreversible cathode redox reaction between CaCl_2 and Cl_2, which introduces a\nnew paradigm for Ca metal batteries with comprehensively high energy densities\nand rate capabilities. LiDFOB, a key electrolyte mediator with unique B\u2212F and\nC=O functional groups, can facilitate the dissociation and distribution of\nCa^2+ and Cl-based species, thus enabling reversible and fast CaCl_2/Cl_2\nredox reaction. The prepared rechargeable Ca/Cl_2 battery delivers discharge\nvoltages of 3 V and remarkable specific capacity (up to 1000 mAh g^\u22121) and\nrate capability (up to 500 mA g^\u22121). The retention and low-temperature\nperformance also overcome the key bottlenecks that have hindered practical\napplications of Ca metal batteries to date. Our findings can not only benefit\nCa metal batteries by enabling highly desirable cathode chemistry but also, in\na broader context, revive the once overlooked Cl-based cathode chemistry for\nmultivalent metal batteries, and harness them for sustainable, low-cost, and\nhigh-performance energy storage.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Preparation of the electrodes and electrolytes\n\nGraphite (99%, Aladdin) was used for cathode preparation. It was mixed with\npolytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, 60% aqueous dispersion, Fuel Cell Store) at a\nmass ratio of 9:1 in ethanol solution. The obtained suspension was then\nsubjected to ultrasonic treatment for 1 h to obtain the cathode slurry. A Ni\nfoam was cut into a 14 mm diameter (1.54 cm^2) circular using a manual disk\ncutter (MSK-T-10, MTI), followed by dropping 50 \u03bcL cathode slurry onto it.\nAfter evaporation of the ethanol at 80 \u00b0C, the above slurry coating and drying\nprocesses were repeated until the mass loading of graphite reached 1.0\u22121.5 mg\ncm^\u22122. The obtained cathodes were further dried at 80 \u00b0C in a vacuum oven for\n2 h. The Ca metal anodes were prepared by polishing the Ca flakes (99%, Sigma\nAldrich, working area of 0.8 cm\u00d7 0.8 cm, thickness of 0.5 \u00b1 0.04 mm) in an\nargon-filled glovebox with the contents of H_2O and O_2 below 1 ppm. All the\nelectrolytes were also prepared in the same glovebox. AlCl_3 (99%, anhydrous,\nAladdin) and SOCl_2 (99%, Aladdin) were used as received. LiDFOB (99%,\nanhydrous, Aladdin) and CaCl_2 (99.9%, anhydrous, Meryer) were dried at 120 \u00b0C\nfor 12 h in a vacuum chamber before use. Typically, 6 M AlCl_3 and 1.3 M\nLiDFOB were dissolved in 1 mL SOCl_2, followed by the addition of 1.2 M CaCl_2\nunder continuous stirring for 1 h to obtain the CALS electrolyte. The gelation\nof the CALS electrolyte generally took 2 h, which allowed us to assemble\nbatteries using the electrolyte in the liquid state.\n\n### Electrochemical measurements\n\nAll the batteries were made inside an argon-filled glovebox with the contents\nof H_2O and O_2 below 1 ppm. The prepared cathode and Ca metal anode were\nseparated by one piece of glass fiber membrane (GF/D, Whatman, 16 mm in\ndiameter) as the separator and 150 \u03bcL electrolyte was added to each coin cell\n(CR2032). All the electrochemical measurements were performed at 25 \u00b0C unless\notherwise stated. The charge\u2013discharge performance of the batteries was\ncharacterized using Neware battery testing systems (CT-4008-5V50mA-164-U).\nElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted on a CHI600E\nelectrochemical workstation. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy\nmeasurement was conducted in a CR2032 coin cell, using a graphite cathode as\nthe working electrode, and a Ca metal foil as the counter and reference\nelectrode. The frequency ranged from 0.1 to 10^5 Hz with an amplitude of 5 mV.\n\n### Characterization\n\nXRD, SEM, TOF-SIMS, XPS, Raman, DEMS, TEM, TGA, DSC, and XAS were performed,\nand detailed information was provided in Supplementary Information.\n\n### Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations\n\nAll MD simulations were conducted using the GROMACS 2019.3 to investigate the\nsolvation structure of electrolytes. The detailed information was provided in\nSupplementary Information.\n\n### Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio\nReporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\n\nThe data that support the plots within this paper and other findings of this\nstudy are available from the corresponding author upon request.\n\n## Code availability\n\nThe codes that support the findings of this study are available from the\ncorresponding author upon request.\n\n## References\n\n  1.
