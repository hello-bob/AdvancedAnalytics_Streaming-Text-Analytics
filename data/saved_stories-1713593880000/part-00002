By aligning rows of tiles that represent the\ngenetic building blocks of different microbes, humans have been able to take\non tasks that even the best existing computer algorithms have been unable to\nsolve yet.\n\nThe project was led by McGill University researchers, developed in\ncollaboration with Gearbox Entertainment Company, an award-winning interactive\nentertainment company, and Massively Multiplayer Online Science (MMOS), a\nSwiss IT company connecting scientists to video games), and supported by the\nexpertise and genomic material from the Microsetta Initiative led by Rob\nKnight from the Departments of Pediatrics, Bioengineering, and Computer\nScience & Engineering at the University of California San Diego.\n\n## Humans improve on existing algorithms and lay the groundwork for the future\n\nNot only have the gamers improved on the results produced by the existing\nprograms used to analyze DNA sequences, but they are also helping lay the\ngroundwork for improved AI programs that can be used in the future.\n\n\"We didn't know whether the players of a popular game like Borderlands 3 would\nbe interested or whether the results would be good enough to improve on what\nwas already known about microbial evolution. But we've been amazed by the\nresults,\" says J\u00e9r\u00f4me Waldisp\u00fchl, an associate professor in McGill's School of\nComputer Science and senior author on the paper published today.\n\n\"In half a day, the Borderlands Science players collected five times more data\nabout microbial DNA sequences than our earlier game, Phylo, had collected over\na 10-year period.\"\n\nThe idea for integrating DNA analysis into a commercial video game with mass\nmarket appeal came from Attila Szantner, an adjunct professor at McGill's\nSchool of Computer Science and CEO and co-founder of MMOs.\n\nThe BLS game. In a, we present the BLS gameplay. Players are tasked with\naligning the colored bricks, representing nucleobases, to the guides on the\nleft, by inserting yellow gap bricks. They receive a bonus for full rows and\nmust reach the par score to progress to the next puzzle. In b, we show the BLS\npipeline from data collection to alignment output, in particular how data flow\nfrom the initial alignment of 1 million sequences to the analysis results\nfeatured in this paper.

DOI:\n10.1038/s41587-024-02175-6\n\n\"As almost half of the world population is playing with video games, it is of\nutmost importance that we find new creative ways to extract value from all\nthis time and brainpower that we spend gaming,\" says Szantner. \"Borderlands\nScience shows how far we can get by teaming up with the game industry and its\ncommunities to tackle the big challenges of our times.\"\n\n\"Gearbox's developers were eager to engage millions of Borderlands players\nglobally with our creation of an appealing in-game experience to demonstrate\nhow clever minds playing Borderlands are capable of producing tangible,\nuseful, and valuable scientific data at a level not approachable with non-\ninteractive technology and mediums,\" said Randy Pitchford, founder and CEO of\nGearbox Entertainment Company.\n\n\"I'm proud that Borderlands Science has become one of the largest and most\naccomplished citizen science projects of all time, forecasting the opportunity\nfor similar projects in future video games and pushing the boundaries of the\npositive effect that video games can make on the world.\"\n\n## Relating microbes to disease and lifestyle\n\nThe tens of trillions of microbes that colonize our bodies play a crucial role\nin maintaining human health. However, microbial communities can change over\ntime in response to factors such as diet, medications, and lifestyle habits.\n\nBecause of the sheer number of microbes involved, scientists are still only in\nthe early days of being able to identify which microorganisms are affected by\nor can affect which conditions.\n\nThis is why the researchers' project and the results from the gamers are so\nimportant.\n\n\"We expect to be able to use this information to relate specific kinds of\nmicrobes to what we eat, to how we age, and to the many diseases ranging from\ninflammatory bowel disease to Alzheimer's that we now know microbes to be\ninvolved in,\" adds Knight, who also directs the Center for Microbiome\nInnovation at the UC San Diego.\n\n\"Because evolution is a great guide to function, having a better tree relating\nour microbes to one another gives us a more precise view of what they are\ndoing within and around us.\"\n\n## Building communities to advance knowledge\n\n\"Here we have 4.5 million people who contributed to science. In a sense, this\nresult is theirs too, and they should feel proud about it,\" says Waldisp\u00fchl.\n\"It shows that we can fight the fear or misconceptions that members of the\npublic may have about science and start building communities who work\ncollectively to advance knowledge.\"\n\n\"Borderlands Science created an incredible opportunity to engage with citizen\nscientists on a novel and important problem, using data generated by a\nseparate massive citizen science project,\" adds Daniel McDonald, the\nScientific Director of the Microsetta Initiative. \"These results demonstrate\nthe remarkable value of open access data and the scale of what is possible\nwith inclusive practices in scientific endeavors.\"\n\nMore information: Roman Sarrazin-Gendron et al, Improving microbial phylogeny\nwith citizen science within a mass-market video game, Nature Biotechnology\n(2024).
