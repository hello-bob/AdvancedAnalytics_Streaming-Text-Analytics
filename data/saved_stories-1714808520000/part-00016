This flexibility means you can drive many unique combinations of\nmotors, servos, steppers, speakers, LED strips and more, all from a single\nYukon host!*\n\nTo ensure Yukon creations are adventure proof, each module is screwed down to\nensure a solid mechanical and electrical connection.\n\n### Assembling Yukon \ud83d\udea7\n\nBig electronic projects can often involve a lot of soldering, splicing and\nother complicated assembly techniques, but not with Yukon! The host board and\nmodules use solderless connectors wherever possible so it's fast and friction-\nfree to get started, and simple to swap out components if you need to.\n\n### Powering Yukon \u26a1\n\nSupplying external power to Yukon is easy thanks to its chunky XT30 connector,\nwhich enables you to attach 2 to 4 cell Lithium Polymer (LiPo) batteries (or\nany other source from 5V to 17V) to deliver up to 15A continuous for your\nhigh-power projects.\n\nAn e-Fuse with switchable output is included to protect from accidental\novervoltage and overcurrent events, along with internal sensors for monitoring\nvoltage, current, and temperature whilst your programs run.\n\n### Programming Yukon \ud83d\udcbe\n\nYukon is supported by a comprehensive MicroPython library with a whopping 50\n(!) examples showing how to use the individual features of the board and all\nof its modules. There are also fully fledged showcase examples to show you how\nYukon can be used to build a remote-controlled rover, spider tank, and pen\nplotter.\n\n## Features\n\n  * Powered by RP2040 (Dual Arm Cortex M0+ running at up to 133MHz with 264kB of SRAM)\n  * 16MB of QSPI flash supporting XiP\n  * 6 x slots for high power modules\n  * E-Fuse with switchable output (40A overcurrent and 18V overvoltage protection)\n  * XT30 connector for V+ and logic power (5 to 17V, 15A continuous)\n  * USB-C for programming and logic power\n  * Power on-off button\n  * 3 x user buttons (one of which also acts as BOOTSEL for entering DFU mode)\n  * 2 x power and 2 x user LEDs\n  * 2 x Qw/ST connectors for attaching breakouts\n  * Internal voltage in, voltage out, current, and temperature sensors\n  * Unpopulated header for attaching Breakout Garden boards\n  * Unpopulated expansion headers for wiring up external buttons and extra IO\n  * Fully assembled\n  * No soldering required (unless you want to use the Breakout Garden or expansion headers).\n  * M2 screws for attaching modules\n  * Rubber feet \ud83d\udc3e\n  * MicroPython firmware and library\n  * Yukon modules and other components are sold separately.\n\n## Yukon Make Anything! Kit Includes\n\nYou can buy a Yukon host (plus screws and feet) on its own, or as part of the\nfully-featured Yukon Make Anything! Kit, which sets you up with all the tools\nto make a bunch of cool stuff. It includes six different modules for driving a\ndiverse range of hardware, plus a selection of useful cables for feeding your\nYukon power and data.\n\n  * Yukon Host (plus screws and feet)\n  * Dual Motor / Bipolar Stepper Module\n  * Quad Servo [Regulated] Module\n  * LED Strip Module\n  * Audio Amp Module\n  * Dual Switched Power Output Module\n  * Proto Module\n  * USB-A to USB-C cable for programming\n  * Loose wire to XT30 cable for power\n  * XT60 to XT30 cable for power\n  * ...all packed up neatly in a reusable Pirate-brand Loot Box.\n\n## Yukon Modules\n\nCustomise Yukon to suit almost any project with our range of addon modules.\nYou can populate your Yukon with a full load-out right away, or start with a\nfew modules and expand as your project grows. There's also a proto module, for\nif you want to add a custom module like a buzzer or a potentiometer.\n\n### Motors\n\n|\n\n### Servos  \n  \n---|---  \n  \n  * Big Motor + Encoder\n  * Dual Motor / Bipolar Stepper\n\n|\n\n  * Quad Servo [Regulated]\n  * Quad Servo [Direct]\n  * Serial Bus Servo\n\n  \n  \n### Output\n\n|\n\n### Audio  \n  \n  * Bench Power [Step-down DAC]\n  * Dual Switched Power Output\n\n|\n\n  * Audio Amp [Mono]\n\n  \n  \n### Lighting\n\n|\n\n### Prototyping  \n  \n  * LED Strip\n\n|\n\n  * Proto\n\n  \n  \n## Pinout and Schematic\n\n  * Download a printable PDF version\n  * Schematic\n  * 3D model (community-contributed model, WIP)\n\n## Connecting Breakouts\n\nThe Qw/ST connectors on Yukon make it super easy to connect up Qwiic or STEMMA\nQT breakouts. If your breakout has a QW/ST connector on board, you can plug it\nstraight in with a JST-SH to JST-SH cable.\n\nBreakout Garden breakouts that don't have a Qw/ST connector can be connected\nusing a JST-SH to JST-SH cable plus a Qw/ST to Breakout Garden adaptor. Want\nto use multiple Qw/ST breakouts at the same time? Try this adaptor!\n\n  * List of breakouts currently compatible with our MicroPython build.\n\n## Notes\n\n  * Measurements: 84mm x 67mm x 14mm (L x W x H). The mounting holes are M2.5 and 3mm in from each edge.\n  * Yukon has some extra broken out headers that adventurous makers might find useful (note that these are unpopulated and so will require soldering):\n\n    * Control header for connecting up external on-off and user/boot buttons, as well as an external power LED\n    * Expansion header for connecting up external A and B user buttons, an LCD display (or use as GPIO), and SWD debugging\n  * The board's current draw when off is 2.05mA @ 5V and 3.25mA @ 17V. As such it is recommended to disconnect any battery pack if the project is not going to be used for a while, to avoid unnecessary draining.\n  * Yukon comes with kapton tape on top of its 8 mounting posts. Remove these before installing any modules.\n  * * Some slot placement and combinations of modules may not be compatible due to shared pin functions\n\n## About RP2040\n\nRaspberry Pi's RP2040 microcontroller is a dual core ARM Cortex M0+ running at\nup to 133Mhz. It bundles in 264kB of SRAM, 30 multifunction GPIO pins\n(including a four channel 12-bit ADC), a heap of standard peripherals (I2C,\nSPI, UART, PWM, clocks, etc), and USB support.\n\nOne very exciting feature of RP2040 is the programmable IOs which allow you to\nexecute custom programs that can manipulate GPIO pins and transfer data\nbetween peripherals - they can offload tasks that require high data transfer\nrates or precise timing that traditionally would have required a lot of heavy\nlifting from the CPU.\n\n### 2 customer reviews\n\n3 months ago\n\nGreat product.
