I\u2019d been driving a\nhand-me-down Hyundai sedan, but I wanted something more reliable for the miles\nI racked up driving around sprawling Dallas for my job as a reporter.\n\nAt first, I narrowed my search to the Mazda 6 \u2014 at least it was more fun than\na Corolla. But as I saved a few options online, hoping for something in dark\ngreen, I said to hell with all that. I could buy a convertible for roughly the\nsame price.\n\nA couple weeks later, a dealer showed me a 2004 Ford Mustang, white with a\ncream-colored canvas top. He pressed a switch on the center console, and down\nwent the top for my test drive. I\u2019d never ridden in a convertible before. On\nback roads twisting through farmland, it felt like the sky had been lowered\nfrom the atmosphere, settling just a few feet above me, close enough to touch\nthe clouds.\n\nAn early 2000s Mustang. (Bill Pugliano/Getty Images)\n\nI bought the Mustang and drove it back into the city with the top down. Over\nthe next couple years, I drove it like that as often as I could: on cool\nnights with the heat turned on and windows rolled up, on a summer road trip\nnearly all the way through Kansas until the sunburn became unbearable.\n\nI never got sick of the convertible. It turned everyday monotony into an\nadventure, replaced the rigid confinement of sedans and SUVs with freedom and\nopenness. Who wouldn\u2019t want one?\n\nBut the year I bought my Mustang, in 2010, US convertible sales were down to\n~140k, less than half of what they\u2019d been just a few years earlier. That was\nduring the Great Recession, near the auto industry\u2019s nadir. Still, the decline\nhas continued.\n\n  * According to S&P Global Mobility, new retail registrations of convertibles totaled ~70k in the 12 months between March 2023 and February 2024, comprising ~0.6% of all vehicle sales. That\u2019s down from ~2% in the mid-2000s.\n  * 2023 sales of the Mustang convertible, which celebrates its 60th anniversary this year, were down ~87% compared to 2001. Its rival, the Chevrolet Camaro, has been discontinued.\n\nConvertibles are an endangered species, along with the American ethos they\nexemplified. When Carvana polled Americans on their dream cars last year, the\nmost coveted was an SUV. The characteristic they sought most in their dream\ncar wasn\u2019t emotional attachment \u2014 it was technology.\n\nWe\u2019re losing the messy, hair-flowing-in-the-wind version of the American Dream\nto something climate-controlled and closed off to the world. And we might\nnever get it back.\n\n#### The car that \u2018satisfies a youthful ambition\u2019\n\nGrowing up in the \u201990s, I rode countless, boring miles in the passenger seats\nof my dad\u2019s Toyota Camry sedan and mom\u2019s Plymouth Voyager minivan.\n\nI pined for a more exotic ride just out of my reach. My next-door neighbor had\nan old European convertible \u2014 a midlife crisis purchase if there ever were one\n\u2014 and I remember the college-aged woman across the street pulling into her\nfamily\u2019s driveway (and looking far cooler) in a Mazda Miata.\n\nThis yearning went back generations, to the time automakers, after\npainstakingly working to enclose early model cars with roofs, realized they\ncould spark people\u2019s imaginations (and extract more from their wallets) by\noffering a topless experience.\n\nFrom Rhett Butler to beachgoers, everybody loved the convertible. (Hulton\nArchive/H. Armstrong Roberts/Classicstock/Tom Kelley/Gary Leonard/Getty\nImages)\n\nCosting anywhere from $2k to $5k in the 1930s, roughly 2x-4x the average\nfamily income at the time, convertibles made by Duesenberg, Rolls-Royce, and\nPackard became status symbols for the prosperous few who could afford them.\n\n\u201cIt is possible to follow the careers of stars through their motor cars,\u201d\nnoted a reporter in 1938. \u201cWhen he or she first reaches the dizzy heights of\nmovie fame, flash, gaudy cars are in order.\u201d\n\nClark Gable owned a Packard convertible, and actor Wayne Morris preferred a\ntopless ride in his Lincoln Zephyr \u201cin any type of weather.\u201d Marlene Dietrich\nwas chauffeured in a tan Rolls-Royce convertible.\n\n\u201cNo doubt,\u201d wrote the reporter, \u201cthe gaudy car... satisfies a youthful\nambition \u2014 and all of us have had it.\u201d\n\nThe less starry got to fulfill their desires when Chevy, Lincoln, and Buick\nintroduced roomy, space-aged convertibles in the \u201950s and \u201960s. My\ngrandparents bought a 1962 seafoam-green Impala.\n\nIn 1964, Ford released the Mustang, the brainchild of famed auto developer and\nexecutive Lee Iacocca. Priced at ~$2.3k, or about one-third of the median\nfamily income, the Mustang was a magnet for middle-class Americans who wanted\nto inject adventure into their daily lives. It also helped bring annual\nconvertible sales to ~500k in the mid-\u201960s, around 5% of total vehicle sales\nin America.\n\nSafety concerns and a weak economy put a kibosh on convertible dreams in the\n\u201970s. Cadillac claimed its \u201976 Eldorado would be the last convertible ever\ndesigned, and total convertible sales fell to ~43k in 1982. But Iacocca\nreignited the flame with the release of the Chrysler LeBaron that year,\nushering in the expanding convertible landscape I grew up with.\n\nThe Hustle\n\nMy dream car back then was a Dodge Viper, but I saw more practical\nconvertibles everywhere in the \u201990s, the peak era for manufacturers to turn\nthe simplest of car models into adventure machines, equipped with rollover\nbars or fortified support pillars for safety.\n\nThe Pontiac Sunfire, Toyota Paseo, Chevrolet Cavalier, Mercury Capri, Honda\nCivic del Sol, Ford Probe, and Geo Metro (which could\u2019ve lost to a riding lawn\nmower in a drag race) all had convertible versions.\n\nThe not-so-fast Geo Metro exemplified the wide variety of convertibles\navailable a generation ago. (Cars & Bids)\n\nAnnual convertible sales climbed to ~170k in the mid-\u201990s. They increased to\n~315k in 2004, about 2% of the entire vehicle market, as automakers perfected\nthe retractable hard top (and, somehow, convinced Americans to buy PT Cruiser\nconvertibles).\n\nYet, as I failed to save for a Toyota Celica convertible by my 16th birthday \u2014\nmy realistic vision of a gaudy purchase \u2014 a tectonic market shift was\nunderway. You could see it reflected in choices made from the Heartland to\nHollywood.\n\nAfter Good Will Hunting catapulted Matt Damon and Ben Affleck onto the A-list,\nfor instance, they splurged on cars just like Gable, Morris, and other young\nstars before them.\n\nExcept they bought Jeep Grand Cherokees. \u201cThe really dope new truck at the\ntime,\u201d Affleck later explained to IMDB.\n\n#### The SUV loophole\n\nBack in the late \u201970s, the legal distinction that helped precipitate the\ndecline of convertibles (and cars in general) seemed insignificant. A loophole\nthe size of a needle eye.\n\nIn response to the oil crisis and a burgeoning environmental movement, federal\nregulations went into effect in 1978 requiring automakers\u2019 passenger car\nfleets to meet a fuel standard of 18 miles per gallon. But \u201cpassenger cars\u201d\nmeant sedans, station wagons, coupes, and convertibles.\n\nIt didn\u2019t apply to \u201clight trucks\u201d such as minivans, pickups, and SUVs, the\nlatter two of which were mostly used by farmers, contractors, and laborers who\nneeded the extra space for hauling material. To avoid placing an economic\nburden on workers, light-truck fleets were subjected to lower standards. While\nautomakers had to shrink cars to hit the fuel standard, light trucks remained\nspacious.\n\nSo began an emphasis on SUVs and trucks (and minivans, at least until an\nassociation with soccer moms doomed them). SUV sales increased from ~112k in\n1981 to ~800k in 1987.\n\nMost Americans still didn\u2019t need to haul anything, but they were hooked. In\n1987, a J.D. Power and Associates survey even found SUV owners felt a sense of\nadventure while driving them \u2014 similar to a convertible.\n\nFor automakers, the economics checked out.\n\n\u201cYou can sell a Cadillac for a lot more than a Chevy even though the Cadillac\nonly costs marginally more to produce than a Chevy. The same thing goes for\nthose truck-based SUVs because they\u2019re sold as rugged,\u201d says David Lucsko, an\nAuburn University professor who researches automotive history. \u201cYou can sell\nthem at a premium and rake in the profits.\u201d\n\nThe Hustle\n\nLater, brands popularized the crossover utility vehicle, giving consumers the\nspace of an SUV with a smoother ride. Crossovers, despite being built on the\nsame frame as a car, are typically classified as light trucks. The takeover\nwas complete: Light trucks outsold cars for the first time in 2002. Their\nsales now comprise nearly 80% of the vehicle market.\n\n#### No cars means no convertibles\n\nThat shift has filled the roads with increasingly large vehicles, which is\nhardly an ideal environment for convertibles. But Drew Dorian, managing editor\nfor Car and Driver, says he\u2019s doubtful safety fears have driven their decline,\nnoting that safety-concerned families would be unlikely to buy convertibles\nanyway.\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has found that, while SUVs have\nlower driver fatality rates than the average vehicle, convertibles aren\u2019t any\nless safe than enclosed sedans or coupes.\n\nSpeaking of sedans and coupes: Many brands don\u2019t even make them anymore. The\nonly Ford car that hasn\u2019t been discontinued in North America, for instance, is\nthe Mustang. No more Taurus or Focus or Fusion. That\u2019s been really bad for\nconvertibles, which are typically derived from cars.\n\nTo develop all those \u201990s convertibles, automakers just tweaked the design of\npopular sedans at a low cost. Now, according to Tom Libby, associate director\nof industry analysis and loyalty solutions at S&P Global Mobility, cars aren\u2019t\npopular enough to justify turning into convertibles.\n\n\u201cTo propose a convertible now, it\u2019s almost impossible to create a proposal\nthat includes a volume that\u2019s big enough to make money,\u201d he says.\n\nThe Hustle\n\nMoney is also in short supply. Car companies are investing huge sums in the\ntransition to electric vehicles, Libby says, and sales of EVs slowed last\nyear, complicating the calculus of how to emphasize true EVs vs. hybrids.\n\nJust as the purchase of a convertible requires a feeling of relative financial\nsecurity and a sense of boldness, so does the act of designing one. And right\nnow most automakers lack both.\n\n#### Opting for open air\n\nAs with movies and clothing, trends rarely die in the auto industry. They go\ninto hibernation until one successful experiment draws copycats and the trend\nbecomes inescapable.\n\nJust as the success of Iacocca\u2019s Chrysler LeBaron led other brands to turn\npopular car models into convertibles in the \u201980s and \u201990s, Libby can imagine\nbrands developing SUV convertibles as they seek niches for consumers demanding\ngreater variation.\n\nThis makes sense: There\u2019s increased time for adventure as millennials delay\nhaving kids or don\u2019t have them at all. While summers may be excruciatingly\nhot, especially in the Sunbelt, the other seasons are warmer than ever. And\nGen Zers crave experiences.\n\n\u201cThe enjoyment of open air,\u201d Libby says, \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s gone away.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut based on what happened to Nissan a few years ago,\u201d he adds, \u201cI don\u2019t\nthink [SUV convertibles are] imminent.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s referring to Nissan\u2019s crossover Murano convertible, which failed to gain\ntraction in the 2010s. Land Rover\u2019s Evoque was also swiftly discontinued.\nAmericans spoke with their wallets: They didn\u2019t want the open air.\n\nThe Land Rover Evoque. (Andy Green/Land Rover via Getty Images)\n\nWhen I\u2019m driving on temperate days, I rarely even see other drivers with their\nwindows down. That might not be a coincidence. Lucsko, the car historian at\nAuburn, says automakers now design vehicles for consumers to seal themselves\nin.\n\n\u201cI think the car has become more and more a cocoon where we go to be isolated\nfrom the world,\u201d he says.\n\nDriving a convertible means being exposed to the world. It means embracing the\nelements and putting yourself out there, an ever-harder proposition in our\nincreasingly curated, digital lives.\n\nMy own convertible era ended years ago. I had to ditch my Mustang for a move\nto hilly, snowbound central Pennsylvania. But I haven\u2019t ditched my ambition\nfor the open air, and I hope Americans haven\u2019t either. Whether it\u2019s a classic\ndroptop or a futuristic roofless SUV, it will always feel good to say to hell\nwith all that and buy a convertible.\n\nTopics: Transportation\n\n## Follow us on social media\n\n## Get Smarter on Business and Tech Thanks for subscribing!\n\nGet the 5-minute newsletter keeping 2M+ innovators in the loop.\n\nWant even more business resources?
