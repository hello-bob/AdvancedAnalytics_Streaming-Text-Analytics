RISC-V's low\ncomplexity is easier to work with than x86, and is a fully open standard \u2014\nunlike Arm, its primary competitor. While not popular in mainstream computing\nproducts, the standard has a high potential for most processor use cases,\nconcerning U.S. lawmakers attempting to limit China's access to advanced\ncomputing power in the ongoing trade war over tech.\n\nThe RISC-V standard is a fully open standard, licensable by anyone, and is\ncurrently held by a Swiss trust to keep its open standard nature intact. But\nthis has not stopped U.S. lawmakers from calling it a U.S.-based tool and\ndeclaring China's use of it to be wrong \u2014 and perhaps dangerous.\n\n> The CCP (Chinese Communist Party) is abusing RISC-V\n>\n> Michael McCaul, House Foreign Affairs\n\n\"The CCP (Chinese Communist Party) is abusing RISC-V to get around U.S.\ndominance of the intellectual property needed to design chips,\" said Michael\nMcCaul, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in his first attack on\nChina's access to RISC-V back in October.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware\n\nThis is not the first time the U.S. government has tried to stop China's\naccess to RISC-V. In October, McCaul and other lawmakers called for China's\naccess to RISC-V to be hampered, which RISC-V International was swift to push\nback on. Callista Redmond, chief executive of RISC-V International, responded\nthat unhampered open standards are important: \"RISC-V is an open standard and\nhas incorporated meaningful contributions from all over the world. As a global\nstandard, RISC-V is not controlled by any single company or country.\"\n\nOpen standards, such as Ethernet, HTTPS, and USB have revolutionized the\ninternet and technology, and restricting access to any of these would have\ncatastrophic impacts on both the embargoed entity and the success of the open-\nsource projects that would now find their reach limited.\n\nIn November 2023, a new group of 18 lawmakers again attacked China's access to\nRISC-V. Yesterday, the Department of Commerce responded to their claims,\nstating it is now \"working to review potential risks and assess whether there\nare appropriate actions under Commerce authorities that could effectively\naddress any potential concerns.\"\n\n## Stay on the Cutting Edge\n\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\ntech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

And while the U.S. continues attempting to ban China's\naccess to any powerful technologies, China is not making relations easier,\nwith a report yesterday finding that Chinese universities have been\nsidestepping sanctions on Nvidia GPUs.\n\nDallin Grimm\n\nMore about tech industry\n\nTSMC says it doesn't need High-NA EUV chipmaking tools for 1.6nm-class node \u2014\nin contrast, Intel has championed the tech\n\nTSMC readies lower-cost 4nm manufacturing tech: Up to 8.5% cheaper\n\nLatest\n\nRaspberry Pi robot uses AI to motivate runners by shouting encouraging\nmessages\n\nSee more latest \u25ba\n\n12 Comments Comment from the forums\n\n  * hotaru251\n\nthis won't work.

I can't speak on legal grounds, but I worry that we'll end up\nwith a huge schism in the tech world, where you basically have Eastern and\nWestern tech that can't interoperate.

The point of leverage is that it contained IP owned by\nUSA-based citizens (and presumably companies ARM licensed it from). I don't\nknow how deep the legal analysis ever went, on such claims.\n\nYes, RISC-V tried to insulate themselves by relocating to Switzerland, but if\nits patent pool includes any contributed by US companies (I think it must?),\nthen you could still see the USA try to control it, in a similar way. Maybe\nSwitzerland doesn't play ball and enforce those claims, but US lawmakers could\nat least try to control involvement in RISC-V or with Chinese entities by US\ncompanies.\n\n> hotaru251 said:\n>\n> Theres legit valid reasons to bar some stuff from another nation...this is\n> not one of those cases.

ARM is a\nprivate company and didn\u2019t HAVE to play ball with the US unless they want to\nmaintain access to the American market.\n\nReply\n\n  * CmdrShepard\n\n> Pierce2623 said:\n>\n> Nobody wants to cut off their access to American technology though, do they?\n\nIf that meant never ever seeing the words \"Recommended for you\" or \"Skip this\nad in 30 seconds\" I am all for it.\n\nReply\n\n  * roba67\n\nChina is unilaterally pulling away from X86 due to US commerce policy\n(Raimondo), this is going to hurt Intel and AMD but it was predictable.\n\nReply\n\n  * watzupken\n\nUS seems to own everything.\n\nReply\n\n  * bit_user\n\n> _Shatta_AD_ said:\n>\n> US over-stepping is going from incredulous to ludicrous.\n\nAs long as this is just something being looked into by some Congressional\ncommittees, I'd say there's not much cause for concern. They're going to look\ninto and say lots of things, sometimes just to score political points.\n\nThe time we should worry is if they start drafting bills that seem to have\nbroad support. Either that, or the Executive branch decides to act within the\nbounds of existing laws.\n\nSo, let's try not to be too hyperbolic (just yet).\n\nReply\n\n  * parkerthon\n\nDoes China simply having access to use the open source design mean they will\nsomehow dominate? Any kind of ban would no doubt be very unilateral in nature.\nThis means China will still use the open source patents anyway. US companies\nwould have to go great efforts to only use certain components. It\u2019s a messy\nsolution that would accomplish nothing except poke China in the eye and make\nthem even more adversarial.\n\nReply\n\n##### Most Popular\n\nAMD Strix Point engineering sample underwhelms in early Geekbench 6 results\n\nAMD-powered classic Macintosh Classic-Inspired mini PC available for retail \u2014\nAyaneo's new AM01 released after a successful Indiegogo campaign\n\nRaspberry Pi Compute Module 4S memory variants announced\n\nTSMC's labor practices draw serious concern in Arizona \u2014 the company's new\nchip plant allegedly plagued by worker abuses\n\nFormer EKWB Employees say company has racist, hostile work environment,\nwithholds overtime pay\n\nGigabyte confirms Ryzen 9000 branding for Zen 5 processors, preps beta BIOS\nupdates for 500-series motherboards\n\nWindows 11 update brings advertisements to the start menu\n\nQualcomm announces Snapdragon X Plus \u2013 10-cores is less than X Elite, but the\nsame 45 TOPS from the NPU\n\nBambu Lab Printer Firmware Updates Have Limited Timeline\n\nMicrosoft blocks some PCs from Windows 11 24H2 \u2014 CPU must support SSE4.2 or\nthe OS will not boot\n\nIntel CPU-dispensing vending machine game spotted in Japan \u2014 one user got a\nCore i7-8700 for $3\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and\nleading digital publisher.
