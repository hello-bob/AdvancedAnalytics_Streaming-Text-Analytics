But that means fewer aerosols to\nhelp cool the planet\u2014and a potential acceleration of global warming.\n\nPhotograph: Kyle Grillot/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nNo good deed goes unpunished\u2014and that includes trying to slow climate change.\nBy cutting greenhouse gas emissions, humanity will spew out fewer planet-\ncooling aerosols\u2014small particles of pollution that act like tiny umbrellas to\nbounce some of the sun\u2019s energy back into space.\n\n\u201cEven more important than this direct reflection effect, they alter the\nproperties of clouds,\u201d says \u00d8ivind Hodnebrog, a climate researcher at the\nCenter for International Climate Research in Oslo, Norway. \u201cIn essence, they\nmake the clouds brighter, and the clouds reflect sunlight back into space.\u201d\n\nSo as governments better regulate air quality and deploy renewable energy and\nelectric vehicles, we\u2019ll get less warming thanks to fewer insulating emissions\ngoing into the sky, but some additional warming because we\u2019ve lost some\nreflective pollution. Hodnebrog's new research suggests that this aerosol\neffect has already contributed to a significant amount of heating.\n\nThe most important component in fossil fuel pollution is gaseous sulfur\ndioxide, which forms aerosols in the atmosphere that linger for mere days. So\nslashing pollution has an almost immediate effect, unlike with carbon dioxide,\nwhich lasts for centuries in the atmosphere.\n\nIt\u2019s a gnarly, unavoidable catch-22, but in no way a reason to keep polluting\nwilly-nilly. Fossil fuel aerosols kill millions of people a year by\ncontributing to respiratory problems, cardiovascular diseases, and other\nhealth issues. So by decarbonizing we\u2019ll improve both planetary and human\nhealth. The urgency is growing by the day: Last year was by far the hottest on\nrecord, and this March was the 10th month in a row to notch all-time highs.\nMeanwhile, ocean temperatures\u2014boosted by El Ni\u00f1o, the warm band of water that\nperiodically arises in the Pacific, which also added heat to the\natmosphere\u2014have soared to and maintained record highs for over a year,\nstunning scientists.\n\n\u201cThe preponderance of those records and the margins by which they were broken\nwas eye-opening,\u201d says Jennifer Francis, senior scientist at the Woodwell\nClimate Research Center in Massachusetts. \u201cUntil society manages to stop\nincreasing the greenhouse blanket, record-smashing events like those in 2023\nwill become more common, even without the boost from El Ni\u00f1o.\u201d\n\nSlowing down the growth of that insulating blanket is already underway. \u201cWe\nseem to be flattening greenhouse gas emissions, which is a good thing,\u201d says\nZeke Hausfather, a research scientist at Berkeley Earth. \u201cBut we\u2019re also\nuncovering some warming that our pollution had historically been masking. And\nbecause of that, our models expected\u2014and we seem to be starting to see\u2014some\nevidence of a speed-up in the rate of surface warming.\u201d This is known in\nclimate science as acceleration. Hausfather points to data showing that since\n1970, the warming rate was 0.18 degree Celsius per decade, which has jumped to\nabout 0.3 degree Celsius per decade over the past 15 years.\n\nIn his new paper, published in the journal Communications Earth and\nEnvironment, Hodnebrog and his colleagues set out to quantify just how much an\neffect curbing aerosols has had. To start, they gathered measurements between\n2001 and 2019 from the Clouds and the Earth\u2019s Radiant Energy System, satellite\ninstruments that detect the difference in the solar energy coming to our\nplanet and the energy reflected back out into space. This is the overall\n\u201cenergy imbalance\u201d of the Earth, with it trending upwards as the world warms.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Business\n\nAirchat Is Silicon Valley\u2019s Latest Obsession\n\nLauren Goode\n\n  * Politics\n\nDonald Trump Poses a Unique Threat to Truth Social, Says Truth Social\n\nWilliam Turton\n\n  * Gear\n\nIkea\u2019s New Range Is Stealth Mode for Gamers\n\nEric Ravenscraft\n\n  * Politics\n\nFake Footage of Iran\u2019s Attack on Israel Is Going Viral\n\nVittoria Elliott\n\nThe researchers then fed global emissions data into four different state-of-\nthe-art climate models and managed to reproduce those satellite measurements.\n\u201cWhen we set the aerosol emissions to constant\u2014so we didn\u2019t include any change\nover time in the aerosol emissions\u2014then this upward trend in the energy\nimbalance was much reduced, and we didn\u2019t manage to reproduce the satellite\nmeasurements,\u201d says Hodnebrog. \u201cSo our main conclusion is that these aerosol\nemission reductions need to be accounted for in order to explain what we see\nnow, what we measure from space.\u201d\n\nThe researchers found that over the past two decades, the reduction in aerosol\nemissions has accounted for nearly 40 percent of the increase in energy\nimbalance\u2014that is, the extra warming energy that\u2019s raised global temperatures.\n\u201cI would be surprised if this will not lead to temporary acceleration in\nsurface temperature warming,\u201d says Hodnebrog of the ongoing tailing off of\naerosol emissions.\n\nProjecting forward with aerosols, though, is tricky, because we\u2019re dealing\nwith extraordinarily complex atmospheric processes. For one, modeling cloud\nformation is notoriously difficult, and it\u2019s hard to tell just how much human-\nmade aerosols contribute to a given cloud versus natural aerosols.\n\nThere\u2019s also uncertainty about how strong a cooling effect aerosols have up in\nthe sky. If they have an intense cooling effect, we\u2019ll get more warming in the\nfuture as they decrease. It\u2019d be like switching off the planet\u2019s air\nconditioning. But if they have a milder cooling effect, losing them wouldn\u2019t\nlead to as much warming. In 2022, a separate team of scientists calculated\nthat if it ends up being the latter case, we\u2019d have a better chance of keeping\nwarming below the 1.5-degree Celsius limit established in the Paris Agreement.\n(In their new aerosols paper, Hodnebrog and his colleagues accounted for this\nuncertainty by running those different models, which had different\nrepresentations of aerosols and their interactions with clouds. Their results\nwere the average of the four models.)\n\nEven in the present day, some scientists are skeptical that we\u2019re seeing\nacceleration of global warming from reduced aerosols. \u201cYes, it is responsible\nfor the acceleration in warming during the 1970s to 1980s,\u201d says climate\nscientist Michael Mann of the University of Pennsylvania. That was when clean-\nair regulations started requiring \u201cscrubbers\u201d on coal-fired power plants to\nremove the sulfur dioxide that forms aerosols. \u201cThere is no evidence for any\nacceleration over the past few decades, however.\u201d\n\nInstead, we could be seeing natural variability, Mann says\u2014the rising and\nfalling of global temperatures over the years that Earth would see even in the\nabsence of human-caused warming. Last year was a good illustration of this.\nRecord-smashing temperatures were due to humans failing to stop pumping so\nmuch carbon into the atmosphere, but also due in part to the natural emergence\nof El Ni\u00f1o. \u201cThink of it as a tide on top of a rising sea,\u201d Mann says. \u201cThe\nrising sea\u2014the steady warming\u2014is what we should be concerned about, and that\nwill continue until net emissions reach zero.\u201d\n\nThat much is very clear, and very much agreed upon by scientists: Humans need\nto stop burning fossil fuels, even if losing some aerosols leads to additional\nwarming going forward. \u201cRight now the recent acceleration is borderline\nsignificant, which is why there\u2019s some debate,\u201d says Francis. \u201cBut aside from\nall this, the real story is the relentless global warming that we know is\ncaused by the thickening blanket of greenhouse gases owing to human\nactivities.\u201d\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * In your inbox: The best and weirdest stories from WIRED\u2019s archive\n\n  * Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s island visitors exposed by data broker\n\n  * 8 Google employees invented modern AI.
