The Wikipedia page on the wheat\nand chessboard problem explains that nothing can keep growing forever. In\nbiology, the unwanted growth usually terminates with the death of the host.\nEver-increasing spending can often lead to the same undesirable result in\norganizations.\n\nConsider the following example of runaway spending growth:\n\nYear| Support and revenue| Expenses| Net assets at year end  \n---|---|---|---  \n2003\u20132004^[1]| $80,129| $23,463| $56,666  \n2004\u20132005^[1]| $379,088| $177,670| $268,084  \n2005\u20132006^[1]| $1,508,039| $791,907| $1,004,216  \n2006\u20132007^[2]| $2,734,909| $2,077,843| $1,658,282  \n2007\u20132008^[3]| $5,032,981| $3,540,724| $5,178,168  \n2008\u20132009^[4]| $8,658,006| $5,617,236| $8,231,767  \n2009\u20132010^[5]| $17,979,312| $10,266,793| $14,542,731  \n2010\u20132011^[6]| $24,785,092| $17,889,794| $24,192,144  \n2011\u20132012^[7]| $38,479,665| $29,260,652| $34,929,058  \n2012\u20132013^[8]| $48,635,408| $35,704,796| $45,189,124  \n2013\u20132014^[9]| $52,465,287| $45,900,745| $53,475,021  \n2014\u20132015^[10]| $75,797,223| $52,596,782| $77,820,298  \n2015\u20132016^[11]| $81,862,724| $65,947,465| $91,782,795  \n2016\u20132017^[12]| $91,242,418| $69,136,758| $113,330,197  \n2017\u20132018^[13]| $104,505,783| $81,442,265| $134,949,570  \n2018\u20132019^[14]| $120,067,266| $91,414,010| $165,641,425  \n2019\u20132020^[15]| $129,234,327| $112,489,397| $180,315,725  \n2020\u20132021^[16]| $162,886,686| $111,839,819| $231,177,536  \n2021\u20132022^[17]| $154,686,521| $145,970,915| $239,351,532  \n2022\u20132023^[18]| $180,174,103| $169,095,381| $254,971,336  \nGraphs are unavailable due to technical issues. There is more info on\nPhabricator and on MediaWiki.org.  \n---  \n  \nIn 2005, Wikipedia co-founder and Wikimedia Foundation founder Jimmy Wales\ntold a TED audience:\n\n> \"So, we're doing around 1.4 billion page views monthly. So, it's really\n> gotten to be a huge thing. And everything is managed by the volunteers and\n> the total monthly cost for our bandwidth is about US$5,000, and that's\n> essentially our main cost. We could actually do without the employee [...]\n> We actually hired Brion because he was working part-time for two years and\n> full-time at Wikipedia so we actually hired him so he could get a life and\n> go to the movies sometimes.\"\n\nAccording to the WMF, Wikipedia (in all language editions) now receives 16\nbillion page views per month.^[19] The WMF spends roughly $2 million USD per\nyear on Internet hosting^[11] and employs some 300 staff.^[20]\n\nThe modern Wikipedia has 11-12 times as many page views than it had in\n2005,^[21] but the WMF is spending 33 times as much to serve up these pages to\nthe readers.^[22] This seems reasonable given that they have improved\nreliability, redundancy and backups. More concerning is the fact that since\n2005 the WMF has hired hundreds of extra employees and is now spending 1,250\ntimes as much overall,^[23] which seems rather excessive considering that the\nactual amount of work they have to do is pretty much the same. WMF's spending\nhas gone up by 85% over the past three years.^[24]\n\nSounds a lot like cancer, doesn't it? For those readers who were around three\nyears ago, did you notice at the time any unmet needs that would have caused\nyou to conclude that the WMF needed to increase spending by $30 million\ndollars? I certainly didn't.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2015, annual inflation in the US was between 1% and 3% per year,\nand cumulative inflation for the entire decade was 21.4%\u2014far less than the\nincrease in WMF spending. We are even metastasizing the cancer by bankrolling\nlocal chapters, rewarding them for finding new ways to spend money.^[25]^[26]\n\nNothing can grow forever. Sooner or later, something is going to happen that\ncauses the donations to decline instead of increase. It could be a scandal\n(real or perceived). It could be the WMF taking a political position that\noffends many donors. Or it could be a recession, leaving people with less\nmoney to give. It might even be a lawsuit that forces the WMF to pay out a\njudgement that is larger than the reserve. Whatever the reason is, it will\nhappen. It would be na\u00efve to think that the WMF, which up to this point has\nnever seriously considered any sort of spending limits, will suddenly discover\nfiscal prudence when the revenues start to decline. It is far more likely that\nthe WMF will not react to a drop in donations by decreasing spending, but\ninstead will ramp up fund-raising efforts while burning through our reserves\nand our endowment.\n\nAlthough this essay focuses on spending, not fundraising, it could be argued\nthat the ever-increasing spending is a direct cause of the kind of fund-\nraising that has generated a storm of\ncriticism.^[27]^[28]^[29]^[30]^[31]^[32]^[33]^[34]^[35] These complaints have\nbeen around for years,^[36] leading one member of a major Wikimedia mailing\nlist to automate his yearly complaint about the dishonesty he sees every year\nin our fundraising banners.^[37]\n\nNo organization can sustain this sort of spending on a long-term basis. We\nshould have leveled off our spending years ago. Like cancer, WMF spending is\ngrowing at an ever-increasing rate. Like cancer, this will kill the patient\nunless the growth is stopped. Some charities can safely grow without limits.\nIf you are feeding 1,000 starving orphans per week, a ten times increase in\nrevenue means that you will be able to feed 10,000 orphans per week. Wikipedia\nisn't like that. It costs a certain amount to have reliable servers, run a\ngood legal team, maintain the core software, etc. But none of the things that\nthe WMF needs to do require ever-expanding spending.\n\nThe reason I have so little faith in the WMF's ability to adapt to declining\nrevenues (note that I specified the WMF; I think Wikipedia has shown an\nexcellent ability to adapt to multiple problems) is the horrific track record\nthey have regarding adapting to other kinds of problems.\n\nIn particular, their poor handling of software development has been well known\nfor many years. The answer to the WMF's problems with software development is\nextensively documented in books such as The Mythical Man-Month and Peopleware:\nProductive Projects and Teams, yet I have never seen any evidence that the WMF\nhas been following standard software engineering principles that were well-\nknown when Mythical Man-Month was first published in 1975. If they had, we\nwould be seeing things like requirements documents and schedules with\nmeasurable milestones. This failure is almost certainly a systemic problem\ndirectly caused by top management, not by the developers doing the actual\nwork.\n\nThis is not to imply that decades-old software development methods are somehow\nsuperior to modern ones, but rather that the WMF is violating basic principles\nthat are common to both. Nothing about Agile or SCRUM means that the\ndevelopers do not have to talk to end users, create requirements, or meet\nmilestones. In fact, modern software development methods require more\ncommunication and interaction with the final end users. Take as an example the\nway Visual Editor was developed. There are many pages of documentation on the\nWMF servers and mailing lists, but no evidence that any developer had any\nserious discussions with the actual editors of Wikipedia who would be using\nthe software. Instead, the role of \"customer\" was played by paid WMF staffers\nwho thought that they knew what Wikipedia editors need better than the editors\nthemselves do. Then they threw the result over the wall, and the community of\nWikipedia editors largely rejected it. Or Knowledge Engine, which was\ndeveloped in secret before being cancelled when word got out about what the\nWMF was planning. Another example: The MediaWiki edit toolbar ended up being\nused by a whopping 0.03% of active editors.^[38]\n\nAfter we burn through our reserves, it seems likely that the next step for the\nWMF will be going into debt to support continued runaway spending, followed by\nbankruptcy. At that point there are several large corporations (Google and\nFacebook come to mind) that will be more than happy to pay off the debts, take\nover the encyclopedia, fire the WMF staff, and start running Wikipedia as a\nprofit-making platform. There are a lot of ways to monetize Wikipedia, all\nundesirable. The new owners could sell banner advertising, allow uneditable\n\"sponsored articles\" for those willing to pay for the privilege, or even sell\ninformation about editors and users.\n\nIf we want to avoid disaster, we need to start shrinking the cancer now,\nbefore it is too late. We should make spending transparent, publish a detailed\naccount of what the money is being spent on and answer any reasonable\nquestions asking for more details. We should limit spending increases to no\nmore than inflation plus some percentage (adjusted for any increases in page\nviews), build up our endowment, and structure the endowment so that the WMF\ncannot legally dip into the principal when times get bad.\n\nIf we do these things now, in a few short years we could be in a position to\ndo everything we are doing now, while living off of the endowment interest,\nand would have no need for further fundraising. Or we could keep fundraising,\nusing the donations to do many new and useful things, knowing that whatever we\ndo there is a guaranteed income stream from the endowment that will keep the\nservers running indefinitely.\n\n## 2016\u20132017 update[edit]\n\nThe above chart and graph have been updated to reflect the 2016\u20132017 results.\n\nObservations as of July of 2018:\n\n  * It is difficult to derive a trend from one year's data, but it appears that the rate of spending is beginning to level off. How much influence this page (and the previous posting of the same argument on various pages) had on this is an interesting question.\n  * We still have a marked lack of transparency on spending. For example, [2] has numbers for \"Grants and awards\" and \"Professional service expenses\" but there is no obvious way of finding out the details of those expenditures (please note that this information may very well be in one of the many, many documents the WMF publishes each year).\n  * All efforts to persuade the WMF to enact any spending cap, even \"limit spending to no more than double last years spending\" have failed.\n  * We appear to be building up our endowment, but it is unclear whether the WMF has structured the endowment so that the WMF cannot legally dip into the principal when times get bad. Without this we have no protection from a sudden drop in revenue while the WMF maintains the current spending levels in the hope that revenue will recover. It is also unclear whether the endowment is legally protected against a large payout as a result of a lawsuit. The current management of the WMF appears to be committed to making immediate and drastic cuts to spending if revenue suddenly drops. Hopefully we will never have to find out.\n\n## 2017\u20132018 update[edit]\n\nThe above chart and graph have been updated to reflect the 2017\u20132018 results.\n\nObservations as of August of 2019:\n\n  * It turns out that the rate of spending is not beginning to level off. Not even close.\n  * The good news is that the donations have also continued to grow, but anyone who thinks that this will continue forever simply does not understand basic economics. I really ought to calculate how soon the present rates of increase will bring us to the point where donations to the WMF are larger than the amount of money in the world. Anyone willing to run those numbers is invited to discuss them on the talk page for this essay.\n  * As for the rest, absolutely nothing has changed. There has been zero actual effort by the WMF to increase transparency on spending. Spending caps are not even something that is being discussed. And it really does look like the WMF has structured the endowment so that they can raid it instead of reducing spending when times get bad -- so in essence it isn't substantively different from any other WMF bank account other than a bit of extra paperwork needed to start draining it. Or maybe not; in another example of the WMF refusing to be be financially transparent, despite repeated requests the WMF has never revealed the actual language of any binding rules (if there are any) on when they can and cannot grab the endowment and use it to keep spending should the rate of donations fall off a cliff.\n\nFrom 2007\u20132008 to 2017\u20132018 donations went from $5,032,981.00 USD to\n$104,505,783.00 USD -- 20.76 times higher.\n\nFrom 2007\u20132008 to 2017\u20132018 spending went from $3,540,724.00 USD to\n$81,442,265.00 USD -- 23 times higher.\n\nIn 2008 Wikipedia had over 5 million registered editors, 250 language\neditions, and 7.5 million articles. Wikipedia.org was the 10th-busiest website\nin the world. We had already started Wiktionary, Wikibooks, Wikinews,\nWikiquote, Wikiversity and Wikispecies, we had already opened chapters in\nmultiple countries, and we had already moved from Florida to San Fransisco.\n\nI was here in 2008. I did not notice any pressing needs that were not funded\nbecause we were spending 4.3% of what we are spending now. What, exactly, are\nwe doing now that we were not doing ten years ago that justifies us spending\ntwenty-three times as much money?\n\n## 2018\u20132019 update[edit]\n\nThe above chart and graph have been updated to reflect the 2018\u20132019 results.\n\nObservations as of March of 2020:\n\nSame old story. Ever increasing spending, based upon the assumption of ever-\nincreasing donations. Not looking forward to the day when it all collapses and\neverybody in the mass media starts pointing to this page and saying \"you were\nwarned years ago\".\n\nWMF fundraising keeps getting more and more aggressive, because they are\ntrying to lengthen an unfinished railway tunnel while a runaway train is\nheading down the tracks at full speed.\n\nNobody at the WMF is even willing to discuss making the endowment a true\nendowment instead of a piggy bank that the WMF is free to break open and loot\nwhen the donations stop increasing.\n\nNothing but the usual empty promises regarding spending transparency.\n\nFun challenge #1: pick any Wikimania from any time in the past. Ask for an\naccounting of the total spent on it. Ask as many places as possible. See if\nyou get an answer.\n\nFun challenge #2: The 2020 Wikimania was cancelled because of the COVID-19\npandemic. Try asking for specifics documenting any bad thing that happened\nbecause we didn't spend money on it this year.\n\nI have personally abandoned all efforts to try to get a response on any of\nthis, but I invite anyone who thinks that they can get answers if only they\nsomehow ask the right questions on the right page to do so and report the\nresults on the talk page.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Wikipedia Signpost February 2017 Opinion/Editorial (a now-obsolete version of this page as edited by the Signpost editors.
