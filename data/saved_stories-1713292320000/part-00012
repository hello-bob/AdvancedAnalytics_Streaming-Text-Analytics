It\u2019s a\ngreat way to organize information and make it easier to read, especially for\nlonger lists.\n\nUse cases:\n\n  * Product lists: For example, a product list can be displayed in an accordion to showcase different products.\n  * Service lists: A service list can be displayed in an accordion to showcase different services.\n  * FAQs: An accordion can be used to display frequently asked questions (FAQs).\n  * News: An accordion can be used to display news articles or blog posts.\n  * Documentation: An accordion can be used to display documentation or instructions.\n\n### Let\u2019s build the structure\n\nUnderstanding the code:\n\n  * x-data=\"{ openIndex: null }\": This is the data that will be used to store the open index.\n  * @click=\"openIndex === 0 ? openIndex = null : openIndex = 0\": This is the event listener that will update the open index when a button is clicked.\n  * x-show=\"openIndex === 0\": This is the condition that will be checked when the open index is 0.\n  * :class=\"{ 'rotate-45': openIndex === 1 }\": This is the class that will be applied to the SVG inside the button based on its open index.\n\nClasses are removed for brevity, but I\u2019ll keep those classes relveant to the\ntutorial.\n\n    \n    \n    <div x-data=\"{ openIndex: null }\"> <div class=\"border rounded-md overflow-hidden\"> <!-- Accordion Item 1 --> <div class=\"border-b\"> <button @click=\"openIndex === 0 ? openIndex = null : openIndex = 0\" class=\"w-full flex justify-between items-center p-4 focus:outline-none text-gray-500 focus:text-orange-500\"> <span>What time is it?</span> <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" stroke=\"currentColor\" class=\"w-6 h-6 transform transition-transform\" :class=\"{ 'rotate-45': openIndex === 0 }\"> <path stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" d=\"M12 4.5v15m7.5-7.5h-15\" ></path> </svg> </button> <div x-show=\"openIndex === 0\" class=\"p-4 border-t text-sm bg-gray-50 text-gray-500\"> I don't know what time it is. </div> </div> <!-- Accordion Item 2 --> <div class=\"border-b\"> <button @click=\"openIndex === 1 ? openIndex = null : openIndex = 1\" class=\"w-full flex justify-between items-center p-4 focus:outline-none text-gray-500 focus:text-orange-500\"> <span>Why not?</span> <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" stroke=\"currentColor\" class=\"w-6 h-6 transform transition-transform\" :class=\"{ 'rotate-45': openIndex === 1 }\"> <path stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" d=\"M12 4.5v15m7.5-7.5h-15\" ></path> </svg> </button> <div x-show=\"openIndex === 1\" class=\"p-4 text-gray-500 bg-gray-50 text-sm border-t\"> Because I have lost the notion of time. </div> </div> </div> </div>\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis is a simple accordion that can be used for many different types of\ncontent, such as products, services, FAQs, news, and documentation.\n\nHope you enjoyed this tutorial and have a great day!\n\n## Reviews and opinions\n\nSee them all\n\n  * \"I bought a beautiful theme from Lexington a couple weeks ago.
