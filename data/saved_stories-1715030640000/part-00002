We live in an era of mounting health worries.\nThe ease of online medical self-diagnosis has given rise to what\u2019s called\ncyberchondria: concern, fueled by consulting \u201cDr. Google,\u201d that escalates into\nfull-blown anxiety. Our medical system features ever more powerful\ntechnologies and proliferating routine preventive exams\u2014scans that peer inside\nus, promising to help prolong our lives; blood tests that spot destructive\ninflammation; genetic screenings that assess our chances of developing\ndisease. Intensive vigilance about our health has become the norm,\nsimultaneously unsettling and reassuring. Many of us have experienced periods\nof worry before or after a mammogram or colonoscopy, or bouts of panic like\nmine about my son\u2019s neck. For some, such interludes become consuming and\ndestabilizing. Today, at least 4 percent of Americans are known to be affected\nby what is now labeled \u201chealth anxiety,\u201d and some estimates suggest that the\nprevalence is more like 12 percent.\n\nAnd yet hypochondria, you may be surprised to learn, officially no longer\nexists. In 2013, the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\nMental Disorders, the so-called bible of psychiatric conditions, eliminated\nhypochondriasis. The change reflected an overdue need to reconceive a\ndiagnosis that people found stigmatizing because it implied that\nhypochondriacs are neurotic malingerers whose symptoms aren\u2019t \u201creal.\u201d The DSM\nintroduced two distinct new diagnoses, illness anxiety disorder and somatic\nsymptom disorder, both of which aim to be neutrally clinical descriptions of\npeople with \u201cextensive worries about health.\u201d What differentiates them is the\npresence or absence of physical symptoms accompanying those fears.\n\nThe symptoms and meanings of hypochondria have shifted continually, always in\nstep with changing conceptions of wellness and disease.\n\nBut the efforts to delineate the spectrum of health anxiety, however, fall\nshort of clarifying the murky nature of hypochondria. The ostensibly helpful\nterms are actually anything but that. Although we know more than ever before\nabout the diseases and mental illnesses that afflict us, the body\u2019s most\nobdurate mysteries remain. Doctors and patients must navigate them together.\nThe only way to do so is by setting aside any impulse to moralize and by\nembracing uncertainty\u2014the very thing that modern medicine is least equipped to\ndo. The abyss between patients\u2019 subjective experience of symptoms and\nmedicine\u2019s desire for objectivity is hard to bridge, as the scholar Catherine\nBelling notes in A Condition of Doubt. This is the space where hypochondria\nstill lives.\n\nThe timing of the writer Caroline Crampton\u2019s new book, A Body Made of Glass: A\nCultural History of Hypochondria, couldn\u2019t be better. What her belletristic\naccount of hypochondria\u2019s long and twisting lineage sometimes lacks in\nauthoritative rigor, it makes up for in vivid evocations of being a patient.\nHer youthful experience with cancer and the anxiety she has suffered ever\nsince propel her undertaking: a tour that includes a sampling of evolving\nmedical science about the condition, as well as literary reflections (from,\namong others, John Donne, Moli\u00e8re, Marcel Proust, Virginia Woolf, and Philip\nLarkin) on the doubt and fear that are inseparable from life in a body that\ngets sick.\n\nRead: The psychology of irrational fear\n\nHypochondria, as Crampton highlights, is not just a lay term for a tendency to\nworry about illness that isn\u2019t there. It\u2019s a diagnosis that has existed for\nhundreds of years. The attendant symptoms and meanings have shifted\ncontinually, always in step with changing conceptions of wellness and disease.\nIn that sense, the history of hypochondria reflects one constant: Each era\u2019s\nideas track its limited understanding of health, and demonstrate a desire for\nclarity about the body and illness that again and again proves elusive.\nKnowing this doesn\u2019t stop Crampton from dreaming of a \u201cdefinitive test for\neverything, including health anxiety itself.\u201d\n\nA Body Made Of Glass - A Cultural History Of Hypochondria\n\nBy Caroline Crampton\n\nHippocrates, known as the father of medicine, used the term hypochondrium in\nthe fifth century B.C.E. to identify a physical location\u2014the area beneath the\nribs, where the spleen was known to lie. Hippocratic medicine held that health\ndepended on a balance among four humors\u2014blood, black bile, yellow bile, and\nphlegm\u2014that affected both body and mind. An excess of black bile, thought to\ncollect in the organs of the hypochondrium, where many people experienced\nunpleasant digestive symptoms, could also cause responses such as moodiness\nand sadness. The term hypochondria thus came to be associated, as the humoral\ntheory persisted into the Renaissance, not only with symptoms like an upset\nstomach but also with sluggishness, anxiety, and melancholy\u2014a convergence of\n\u201ctwo seemingly unrelated processes within the body: digestive function and\nemotional disorder,\u201d as Crampton notes.\n\nBy the 17th century, the notion of hypochondria as a fundamentally physical\ncondition that also had mental symptoms had been firmly established. In The\nAnatomy of Melancholy (1621), the English writer and scholar Robert Burton\ndescribed it as a subset of melancholia, noting a \u201csplenetic hypochondriacal\nwind\u201d accompanied by \u201csharp belchings\u201d and \u201crumbling in the guts,\u201d along with\nfeeling \u201cfearful, sad, suspicious\u201d\u2014an illness that, as he put it, \u201ccrucifies\nthe body and mind.\u201d Physicians in the 18th century began to investigate\nhypochondria as a disorder of the recently discovered nervous system,\naccounting for symptoms not just in the gut but in other parts of the body as\nwell. According to this view, the cause wasn\u2019t imbalanced humors but fatigue\nand debility of the nerves themselves.\n\nThe story of Charles Darwin, which Crampton tells in her book, illustrates the\ntransition between the period when hypochondria was still seen primarily as a\nphysical disease and the period when it began to look like a primarily\npsychological condition. Darwin, who was born in 1809, suffered from intense\nheadaches, nausea, and gastric distress, as well as fatigue and anxiety, all\nof which he chronicled in a journal he called \u201cThe Diary of Health.\u201d Although\nvarious posthumous diagnoses of organic diseases have been proposed\u2014including\nsystemic lactose intolerance\u2014Crampton observes that Darwin\u2019s need to follow\nstrict health regimens and work routines could be interpreted as a\nmanifestation of undue worry. This blurred line between intense (and possibly\nuseful) self-scrutiny and mental disorder became a challenge for doctors and\npatients to address.\n\nA fundamental shift had taken place by the late 19th century, thanks to the\nemergence of views that went on to shape modern psychology, including the idea\nthat, as Crampton puts it, \u201cthe mind ... controlled the body\u2019s experiences and\nsensations, not the other way around.\u201d Distinguished by what the neurologist\nGeorge Beard, in the 1880s, called \u201cdelusions,\u201d hypochondria was reconceived\nas a mental illness: It was a psychological state of unwarranted concern with\none\u2019s health.\n\nIn the 20th century, the prototypical hypochondriac became the kind of\nneurotic whom Woody Allen plays in Hannah and Her Sisters: someone who\nobsessively thinks they are sick when they\u2019re not. Freud\u2019s view that\nunexplained physical symptoms can be the body\u2019s expression of inner\nconflict\u2014meaning that those symptoms could be entirely psychological in\norigin\u2014played an influential role. The idea that stress or anguish could\nmanifest as bodily distress, in a process that came to be called\n\u201csomatization,\u201d spread. So did 20th-century medicine\u2019s new capacity to test\nfor and rule out specific conditions. Consider Allen\u2019s character in that film,\nfretting about a brain tumor, only to have his worries assuaged by a brain\nscan. This newly psychologized anxiety, juxtaposed with medical science\u2019s\nobjective findings, helped solidify the modern image of the hypochondriac as a\ncomedic figure, easily caricatured as a neurotic who could, and should, just\n\u201csnap out of it.\u201d\n\nUnlike some other forms of anxiety, health worries are a problem that neither\nbetter labels nor improved treatments can hope to completely banish.\nHypochondria, the writer Brian Dillon pointedly notes in his The\nHypochondriacs: Nine Tormented Lives, ultimately \u201cmakes dupes of us all,\nbecause life, or rather death, will have the last laugh.\u201d In the meantime, we\ndoubt, wait, anticipate, and try to identify: Is that stabbing headache a\npassing discomfort, or a sign of disease? Our bodies are subject to\nfluctuations, as the medical science of different eras has understood\u2014and as\ntoday\u2019s doctors underscore. The trick is to pay enough attention to those\nchanges to catch problems without being devoured by the anxiety born of paying\ntoo much attention.\n\nIn retrospect, Crampton, as a high-school student in England, wasn\u2019t anxious\nenough, overlooking for months a tennis-ball-size lump above her collarbone\nthat turned out to be the result of Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, a blood cancer. Her\ndoctor told her she had a significant chance that treatment would leave her\ncancer-free. After chemo, radiation, one relapse, and a stem-cell transplant,\nshe got better. But the experience left her hypervigilant about her body,\nanxious that she might miss a recurrence. As she reflects, \u201cit took being\ncured of a life-threatening illness for me to become fixated on the idea that\nI might be sick.\u201d Her conscientious self-monitoring gave way to panicked\nvisits to urgent care and doctors\u2019 offices, seeking relief from the thought\nthat she was experiencing a telltale symptom\u2014a behavior that she feels guilty\nabout as a user of England\u2019s overstretched National Health Service. \u201cAt some\npoint,\u201d she writes, \u201cmy responsible cancer survivor behavior had morphed into\nsomething else.\u201d\n\nFrom the January/February 2014 issue: Scott Stossel on surviving anxiety\n\nWhat Crampton was suffering from\u2014the \u201csomething else\u201d\u2014seems to be what the DSM\nnow labels \u201cillness anxiety disorder,\u201d an \u201cexcessive\u201d preoccupation with\nhealth that is not marked by intense physical symptoms. It applies both to\npeople who are anxious without apparent cause or symptoms and to people like\nCrampton, who have survived a serious disease that might recur and are\nunderstandably, but debilitatingly, apprehensive.\n\nIt can be hard to distinguish this term, Crampton finds, from the DSM \u2019s other\none, somatic symptom disorder, which describes a disproportionate\npreoccupation that is accompanied by persistent physical symptoms. It applies\nto people who catastrophize\u2014the person with heartburn who grows convinced that\nshe has heart disease\u2014as well as those with a serious disease who fixate, to\ntheir detriment, on their condition. The definition makes a point of endorsing\nthe validity of a patient\u2019s symptoms, whatever the cause may be; in this, it\nembodies a 21st-century spirit of nonjudgmental acceptance. Yet because it is\na diagnosis of a mental \u201cdisorder,\u201d it inevitably involves assessments\u2014of,\namong other things, what counts as \u201cexcessive\u201d anxiety; evaluations like these\ncan be anything but clear-cut. Medicine\u2019s distant and not so distant past\u2014when\nmultiple sclerosis was often misdiagnosed as hysteria, and cases of long COVID\nwere dismissed as instances of pandemic anxiety\u2014offers a caution against\nconfidently differentiating between psychological pathology and poorly\nunderstood illness.\n\nIn Crampton\u2019s view, the DSM \u2019s revision has turned out to be \u201can extensive\nexercise in obfuscation.\u201d Some physicians and researchers agree that the\ncategories neither lump nor split groups of patients reliably or helpfully. A\n2013 critique argued that somatic symptom disorder would pick up patients with\n\u201cchronic pain conditions [and] patients worrying about the prognosis of a\nserious medical condition (e.g., diabetes, cancer),\u201d not to mention people\nwith undiagnosed diseases. A 2016 study failed to provide \u201cempirical evidence\nfor the validity of the new diagnoses,\u201d concluding that the use of the labels\nwon\u2019t improve the clinical care of patients suffering from \u201chigh levels of\nhealth anxiety.\u201d\n\n\u201cHypochondria only has questions, never answers, and that makes us perpetually\nuneasy,\u201d Crampton writes. Still, she finds that she almost mourns the old\nterm. Its imperfections fit her messy experience of anxiety\u2014and help her\ndescribe it to herself and doctors, giving \u201cedges to a feeling of uncertainty\u201d\nthat she finds overwhelming. But her position, she acknowledges, is a\nprivileged one: As a former adolescent cancer patient, she gets care when she\nseeks it, and doesn\u2019t really have to worry about being stigmatized by doctors\nor friends.\n\nCrampton\u2019s concerns and her experience, that is, are legible to the medical\nsystem\u2014to all of us. But that is not true for the millions of patients (many\nof them young women) suffering from fatigue or brain fog who struggle to get\ndoctors to take their symptoms seriously, and turn out to have a condition\nsuch as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome or an autoimmune\ndisease. They, too, are pulled into the story of hypochondria\u2014yet the DSM \u2019s\nlabels largely fail to solve the problem these patients encounter: In the long\nshadow of Freud, we are still given to assuming that what clinicians call\n\u201cmedically unexplained symptoms\u201d are psychological in origin. Fifteen-minute\nappointments in which doctors often reflexively dismiss such symptoms as\nindicators of anxiety don\u2019t help. How can doctors usefully listen without\ntime\u2014or medical training that emphasizes the bounds of their own knowledge?\n\nThis omission is the real problem with the DSM \u2019s revision: It pretends to\nhave clarity we still don\u2019t have, decisively categorizing patients rather than\nscrutinizing medicine\u2019s limitations. The challenge remains: Even as evidence-\nbased medicine laudably strives to nail down definitions and make ever-finer\nclassifications, patients and practitioners alike need to recognize the\nexistential uncertainty at the core of health anxiety. Only then will everyone\nwho suffers from it be taken seriously. After all, in an era of pandemics and\nDr. Google, what used to be called hypochondria is more understandable than\never.\n\nSomeday we might have the longed-for \u201cdefinitive test\u201d or a better set of\nlabels, but right now we must acknowledge all that we still don\u2019t know\u2014a\ncondition that literature, rather than medicine, diagnoses best. As John Donne\nmemorably wrote, in the throes of an unknown illness, now suspected to have\nbeen typhus, \u201cVariable, and therefore miserable condition of man!
