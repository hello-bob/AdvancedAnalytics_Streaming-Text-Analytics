You wouldn\u2019t think it... but it\u2019s kind of a wild story.\n\n### Before Mozilla had a browser\n\nOur story starts back in 1998...\n\nThe source code for Netscape, once the most popular web browser in the world,\nhad just been released as open source under \u201cThe Mozilla Project.\u201d\n\nAnd, over the few years that followed (funded by AOL Time Warner), several web\nbrowsers were created which used that core Mozilla code. Web browsers that,\nfor the most part, have long been forgotten.\n\nWeb Browsers such as Galeon, K-Meleon, QBAT.i, and SkipStone. Many browsers,\nfor many platforms... all built using the core Mozilla web rendering engine.\nYet there was no official \u201cMozilla\u201d web browser.\n\nBy 2002 it was determined that needed to change.\n\n### Enter the Phoenix\n\nOn September 23rd, 2002, the very first release of the official Mozilla web\nbrowser hit the Internet.\n\nVersion 0.1 of... \u201cPhoenix\u201d.\n\nA big red, flame-y bird that looks like it was drawn with a crayon. What\u2019s not\nto love?\n\nPhoenix! A fantastic name! So much symbolism!\n\nA new web browser, rising from the ashes of Netscape (which appeared to be\nlosing the browser war to Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer). An inspired choice.\n\nThere was just one teensy-weensy little problem: There was already a web\nbrowser with that name.\n\n\u201cPhoenix FirstWare Connect\u201d was a web browser, developed by Phoenix\nTechnologies, that ran entirely in their BIOS (without need for an operating\nsystem).\n\nThat\u2019s right. Mozilla, the people who spent years building web browser\nrendering engines, had no idea there was already a browser named \u201cPhoenix\u201d\nwhen they chose the name. If only there had been some sort of engine they\ncould have used to search the Web.\n\n*cough cough*\n\nPhoenix Technologies didn\u2019t much care for Mozilla using their name. Obviously.\n\nEither Mozilla needed to change their name... or buckle down for a legal fight\nthey were sure to lose. Mozilla may have had the backing of AOL Time Warner...\nbut Phoenix Technologies was big enough (and with a strong enough case) to\ntake them on.\n\n### Synonyms to the rescue!\n\nLuckily, someone at Mozilla managed to get ahold of an encyclopedia (or\npossibly a really good thesaurus) and found another word that was often used\nin place of \u201cPhoenix.\u201d\n\nOn May 17, 2003 the Phoenix browser was renamed... to Firebird.\n\nThis was incredibly handy... as Mozilla didn\u2019t even need to change the logo!\nThe big, red, flame-y bird could stay! Huzzah!\n\nAnd, this time around, the Mozilla team learned to use a Search Engine to see\nif another web browser already had the same name! Smart!\n\n... Unfortunately, it turns out there was already another open source project,\nsponsored by a different company, using the \u201cFirebird\u201d name: The Firebird\nDatabase Server.\n\nBut -- and here's the wild part -- Mozilla simply didn\u2019t care.\n\nThey decided to adopt the name of the exiting project anyway. They didn\u2019t even\ncontact the other project first. Because they were Mozilla... a part of AOL\nTime Warner... and they didn\u2019t feel like they needed to do such things.\n\n### Mozilla the bully\n\nHaving two open source projects \u2014 both running on the same computer platforms\n\u2014 using the exact same name and very similar imagery... is not ideal. To say\nthe least.\n\nEspecially for the smaller project that came first.... Firebird Database\nServer.\n\nLogo for the \u201cFirebird Database Server\u201d.\n\nHaving a new project copy your name, then plaster the Internet with links to\ntheir new project, all backed by AOL? It would become almost impossible to\nfind information about the original project!\n\nThis was, obviously, a fight worth having. The \u201cFirebird Database Server\u201d\nfolks needed to defend their trademark... almost as a matter of survival.\n\nUnfortunately...\n\n  * Mozilla was part of AOL Time Warner. A huge, mega corporation with a vast army of lawyers.\n\n  * The company that sponsored \u201cFirebird Database Server\u201d, was a little company called \u201cIBPhoenix\u201d with a limited budget. And, what\u2019s worse, no army of lawyers.\n\nMozilla was an 800 pound gorilla, and \u201cIBPhoenix / Firebird Database\u201d simply\nwas too small to be able to afford a fight with the likes of AOL Time Warner.\n\nObviously, IBPhoenix asked Mozilla to not use their name... but to no avail.\n\nAfter Mozilla refused to change their name, IBPhoenix did the only thing they\ncould think of... they pleaded with their developers and users to email\nMozilla, and ask Mozilla to stop using their name.\n\nMozilla, again, refused. \u201cWe're still going to use the project name Mozilla\nFirebird,\u201d stated a Mozilla representative in an interview where they attacked\nthe database maker.\n\nThe public was beginning to see what a bully Mozilla could be.\n\nThings were not going well for Mozilla at this point. Users were beginning to\nboycott the Mozilla browser, and the bad press was getting severe with\nheadlines like \"Phoenix flies from frying pan to fire\" and \"Mozilla's Firebird\ngets wings clipped\".\n\n### Then Mozilla plays word association\n\nAfter nearly a full year of Mozilla using the \u201cFirebird\u201d name \u2014 knowingly\nharming the \u201cFirebird Database Server\u201d the entire time \u2014 Mozilla finally caved\nto the public pressure to change the name of their web browser.\n\nOn February 9, 2004, the name for the Mozilla web browser officially changed\nto \u201cFirefox\u201d with the release of the 0.8 version.\n\nWhy did the name become \u201cFirefox\u201d? Because it sounded similar to \u201cFirebird.\u201d\n\nSeriously. \u201cFirefox\u201d is a name for a panda... which had absolutely nothing to\ndo with a \u201cPhoenix\u201d or \u201cFirebird\u201d... but it had \u201cFire\u201d in it... so it was good\nenough!\n\nWell, that and Mozilla felt like there couldn\u2019t possibly be any software\ncompany, product, or project with that name. The Mozilla leadership was pretty\nkeen on avoiding yet another trademark dispute before their web browser had\neven reached version 1.0.\n\nMozilla even made sure to register \u201cFirefox\u201d as a Trademark in the USA. Phew!\nThey learned their lesson!\n\nWell. Almost.\n\n### They forgot about the United Kingdom\n\nWhile the Mozilla leadership felt like the name \u201cFirefox\u201d must be totally\nunique in the software world... it really, really wasn\u2019t.\n\nIn fact, the name \u201cFirefox\u201d had been in use for almost a decade by a software\ncompany in the United Kingdom named The Charlton Company.\n\nThe Firefox trademark with the UK Intellectual Property Office.\n\nTo make matters worse... the name \u201cFirefox\u201d was specifically being used for\n\u201ccommunications and connectivity\u201d software. Which is kinda-sorta-exactly how\nyou would describe a web browser.\n\nWOOPS!\n\nThis would be like a new company creating a carbonated soft drink named\n\u201cCoke\u201d... but thinking it was ok to use the already-in-use name... because...\nyou know... they wanted to.\n\nBut, rather than get involved in yet another public fight over the third name\nthey\u2019ve chosen... Mozilla tried to settle things behind the scenes.\nEventually, by some time in 2005, Mozilla reached a deal with the \u201cFirefox\u201d\ntrademark holder to use the name.\n\nWhat the terms of that deal are remains unknown.\n\n### Firefox it shall be!\n\nSo, there you have it! Mozilla went through three different names for their\nweb browser \u2014 all before they even hit version 1.0.\n\n  * They completely failed to look around for others using their new name. Multiple times.\n  * They bullied an open source project they stole a name from.\n  * Eventually they screwed up their renaming too many times and simply had to strike a deal with somone whose name they copied.\n\nA wild tale of incompetence, bullying, and not knowing how to use a search\nengine.\n\nYet, after all of that, Firefox managed to become a nearly household name. A\nbrand recognized around the world... even if less than 3% of computer users\nactually use it.\n\nJoin the Lunduke Community\n\nTo read more articles like this, sign up and join my community today\n\n25\n\nView All\n\n12\n\nWhat else you may like...\n\nVideos\n\nPodcasts\n\nPosts\n\nArticles\n\nBryan Lunduke@Lunduke\n\n2 hours ago\n\nMozilla: A Bully from the Very Beginning\n\nThe story of how \"Firefox\" was named.\n\nRead the full article: https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5577706/why-is-firefox-\ncalled-firefox\n\n00:19:45\n\n2\n\nView All\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nBryan Lunduke@Lunduke\n\nMay 01, 2024\n\nThe Lunduke Journal got it wrong about Wikipedia!\n\nFacts are important.

From Flying Toasters to 3D\nMazes, screensavers were found on every major operating system across the\nland.\n\nScreensavers are a fun, and loved, part of the 1990s (and onward) computing\nexperience. But what was the very first one created? What is the story behind\nthe early screensavers? Inquiring minds want to know!\n\nLet\u2019s dive into the glorious early history of... the Screensaver.\n\n### The Dreaded Screen Burn-in\n\nLeave any CRT screen (be it a standard television , computer monitor, or even\nan oscilloscope) on for too long \u2014 with the same, non-moving image \u2014 and\nyou\u2019ll eventually give your CRT something known as \u201cBurn-in\u201d.\n\nPLEASE WAIT\n\nBurn-in is caused by the way CRT\u2019s work: The phosphors which produce the light\non the screen tend to lose their luminance over time. Over-use of specific\nareas will, eventually, cause a dramatic enough change that ghost images can\nappear.\n\nScreensavers were created to reduce this problem. By making sure that no\nsingle portion of the screen could sit, displaying the exact same image, for\ntoo long of a period.\n\n### 1961\n\nThe first known reference to something akin to a screensaver is in Robert\nHeinlein\u2019s Sci-Fi novel, \u201cStranger in a Strange Land\u201d.\n\n> \u201cThey went to the living room; Jill sat at his feet and they applied\n> themselves to martinis. Opposite his chair was a stereovision tank disguised\n> as an aquarium; he switched it on, guppies and tetras gave way to the face\n> of the well-known Winchell Augustus Greaves.\u201d\n\nA fish aquarium screensaver (or something very close to it), talked about all\nthe way back in 1961. Pretty cool.\n\nThis was, of course, merely a casual reference in a work of fiction. Still...\nfun to note where Sci-Fi predicts reality.\n\nMany years passed without any actual screensaver being produced. Until...\n\n### 1977\n\nIn 1977, a handful of games for the new Atari Video Computer System (later\nnamed the Atari 2600), included simple color cycling effects in order to\nprevent screen burn-in.\n\nThe Atari VCS 2600\n\nWere these full fledged \u201cscreensavers\u201d as we know them nowadays? Not exactly.\nBut they did serve to \u201csave the screen\u201d.\n\n### 1979\n\nThen, in 1979, Atari released two computer systems: The Atari 400 and 800.\nMuch like the Atari 2600, these Atari computers used a color cycling effect in\norder to limit screen burn-in. In this case, the effect kicked in after the\ncomputer sat idle for a number of minutes.\n\nThe Atari 800\n\nNot exactly a \"Screensaver\" -- at least not as we know them today. But it's\nthe early steps in that direction.\n\n### 1983\n\nA few years later, in January of 1983, the Apple Lisa (the precursor to the\nMacintosh) was released. Within it was a system wide Preferences application\nthat allowed the user to set the Lisa to \u201cdim\u201d the display after a definable\namount of time.\n\nApple Lisa Preferences\n\nNote the non-specific amount of time to wait before the screen dims. \u201cI would\nlike the screen to dim between, say, 15 and 30 minutes after I stop using it.\u201d\n\nI find the large time windows highly amusing. Could the Apple Lisa not handle\nspecific amounts of time? Fascinating.\n\nJust the same, this is notable as it is the first time an easily configurable\n\u201cscreensaver\u201d like utility is provided on a computer.\n\nLater that same year \u2014 in the December, 1983 issue of Softalk Magazine, a\nyoung programmer named John Socha published the source code for a small piece\nof software he dubbed \u201cSCRNSAVE.COM\u201d.\n\nSave Your Monitor Screen!\n\nThat first PC screensaver was pretty darn simple \u2014 it made the screen go blank\nafter an amount of time set in the source code. And, because this was the\nearly 1980\u2019s, you typed the whole thing in by hand from the pages of a\nmagazine.\n\nWant to change how long your computer would wait until the screen went blank?\nModify the source code and re-compile.\n\nSide note: Many claim that John Socha\u2019s SCRNSAVE.COM was the first screen\nsaver. Clearly the Apple Lisa shipped first (as did the Atari 400/800). But it\nvery well may be the first screensaver for the IBM PC, which is already a very\ncool badge of honor. Also worth noting that its author, John Socha (who is\nalso the creator of Norton Commander), would go on to significant things in\nthe screensaver world.\n\n### 1988\n\nEvery attempt at \"saving screens\", up until now, had been pretty... dull.\nBlack screens. Color cycling. Just enough to pevent screen burn. That was\nabout to change.\n\nThe first publicly released screensaver package which contained distinct,\nconfigurable displays... was the \u201cMagic ScreenSaver\u201d for Windows 2.0, first\nreleased in 1988 by Bill Stewart and Ian Macdonald as a piece of shareware.\n\nPasswords! Sleep area! All the basics of screensavers are here!\n\nThe early versions of Windows did not contain any built-in screensaver\nfunctionality. Magic ScreenSaver added that. And it looked like this:\n\nOooooooh. So many lines.\n\nThis was it. Magic ScreenSaver in 1988. This was the turning point when\n\"Screensavers\" became \"Screensavers\" as we know them today.\n\n### 1989\n\nRemember how the Apple Lisa had a built-in screen dimming functionality?\nStrangely, just like early Windows, the Macintosh did not have anything like\nthat.\n\nEnter: After Dark.\n\nOriginally developed by James Eastman, After Dark was a screen saver package\nfor the Macintosh. It was initially an un-named hobby project which, after it\nwas shared with a friend at Berkeley Systems, was acquired and renamed \u201cAfter\nDark\u201d.\n\nThe first version of After Dark.\n\nThe first release of After Dark used no bitmap artwork (relying entirely on\nprogrammatically generated graphics) and was not anticipated to be a big hit.\nBut it was. And the crew at Berkeley then scrambled to polish it up and\nrelease a new version.\n\n### 1990\n\nBerkeley Systems pushed ahead on adding a new artistic flair to After Dark as\nthey worked on the 2.0 release for Macintosh.\n\nTo bring a Windows version to market, they contacted the makers of Magic\nScreenSaver to modify and enhance their shareware software... thus morphing it\ninto \u201cAfter Dark for Windows\u201d.\n\nThe 2.0 release brought with it a small pile of new screen saver animations...\n\nWelcome to Windows, After Dark.\n\nBut the real breakout hit was \u201cFlying Toasters\u201d.\n\nFly! Fly you toasters!\n\nIn a 2007 interview with LowEndMac, the creator of After Dark (James Eastman)\nrecalls the birth of those flying toasters:\n\n> \u201cFor 2.0 we needed to build more personality into it \u2013 really engage. We\n> thought this over in the abstract for quite a while. My wife\u2019s a doctor \u2013\n> she was doing her residency then and was frequently gone overnight. So I\u2019d\n> sit up late programming. Very late.\n>\n> I had a Mac II with a color screen \u2013 $5,000 computer in those days.\n>\n> One of those late nights I was thinking about the artistry problem \u2013 how to\n> do something really fun for 2.0.\n>\n> I was wandering around the house. I drifted into the kitchen, and the\n> toaster caught my eye. My sleep-deprived brain put wings on it.\n>\n> I went upstairs and drew some animation frames \u2013 I used the development\n> system\u2019s icon editor. Little white outline toasters on a black background\n> with little stubby plucked-chicken wings speed lines and a flapping\n> electrical cord. I coded up the animation that night and brought it to\n> Berkeley Systems the next day.\n>\n> Everybody thought it was hilarious and everybody agreed it needed to be\n> redrawn.\n>\n> Wes brought in an artist to re-render the toasters, and Patrick re-coded the\n> module in C. The modules all had a little control panel \u2013 I insisted on\n> having a slider that controlled the doneness of the toast.\u201d\n\nThe result was an instant hit \u2014 and an enduring classic.\n\nThe \"doneness\" of the toast was, indeed, a nice touch.\n\nWhich brings us to the end of 1990... the popularity of the screensaver was\nabout to explode.\n\nAnd, wouldn't you know it, the release of After Dark 2.0 brough with it a\nScreensaver module named \"Aquatic Realm\". A virtual fish tank.\n\nJust like Robert Heinlein wrote about way back in 1961.\n\nAfter Dark's \"Aquatic Realm\"\n\nFrom Sci-Fi novel to reality. Only took us 29 years to get there.\n\nNot too darn shabby.\n\nRead full Article\n\n13\n\nView All\n\n5\n\nReply\n\nBryan Lunduke@Lunduke\n\n19 hours ago\n\n1950s Sci-Fi Style Computers, Powered by a Z80, Built in Holland\n\nRemembering the (very) funky Holborn computers of the early 1980s\n\nBetween 1980 and 1983, a little company in The Netherlands built the \u201cHolborn\u201d\nseries of computers... which can best be described as \u201c1950s sci-fi... powered\nby a Z80\u201d.\n\nNote: The \u201cHolborn\u201d name is to signify that these computers were \u201cBorn in\nHolland\u201d. Hol. Born.\n\nWhile the company only lasted for a few years \u2014 and they only produced a\nhandful of models \u2014 their distinctive designs (for both their cases and their\nhardware & software choices) are worthy of being remembered.\n\nJust to give you a good example... this is the Holborn 9100 (and connected\nterminals):\n\nI mean. Wow! Just look at that monitor! That distinctive neck just screams\n\u201c1950s futurism\u201d... and I absolutely love it.\n\nOk. Let\u2019s back up a moment.\n\nThe company was founded in Hengelo (a town in The Netherlands, near the German\nborder). This is their first office space:\n\nPictured below are the founders of the company \u2014 Dick Gerdzen (left) and Hans\nPolak (right) \u2014 surrounded by a bunch of Holborn computers and terminals.\n\nNow. The computers. Let\u2019s tackle them in chronological order.\n\n### The Holborn 9100\n\nThe first computer from Holborn was the 9100 (and the accompanying 9120\nterminal). Pictured on the left in the picture below.\n\nPhoto Courtesy: Hack42 Museum\n\nNote that the 9100 computer portion (where the CPU, drives, etc. were\ncontained) is the size of a mini-fridge or a low profile filing cabinet (with\nthe 9120 terminal sitting on top).\n\nYeah. The big filing cabinet thing on the floor? That\u2019s the primary computer\nunit.\n\nThe specs of this system were as follows:\n\n  * Zilog Z80 CPU @ 3.5 MHz\n\n  * 72 KB of RAM (expandable to 220 KB)\n\n  * 8 inch floppy drives\n\nWhich brings us to the Operating System... it was 100% custom and in-house\ndeveloped. The Holborn OS was a multi-user system, booted entirely from ROM,\nwhich allowed multiple Holborn 9120 terminals to connect to a single Holborn\n9100 computer (\u201cServer\u201d).\n\nOne extra (and optional) feature of the 9100... it had a photosensitive light\npen which could be used as a pointing device. Not a mouse, but a light pen.\n\nWhat did the Holborn Operating System look like in practice? How did it work?\nHow, exactly, did the light pen work with the included software?\n\nThose are questions I\u2019ve had for many years... yet, despite hunting high and\nlow, have never found so much as a single picture showcasing the Holborn OS in\nany readable way. Due to the Holborn OS only being available in ROM on the\n9100 itself... no known digital archival copy exists.\n\nIn the end, only roughly 200 Holborn 9100 units were sold. (Though that number\nis debated... more on that in a moment.)\n\n### The Holborn 7100\n\nThis was a simplified (and cheaper) version of the 9100. Instead of supporting\na whole office worth of connected terminals (as with the 9100), the 7100 only\nsupported two connected terminals (users) at once.\n\nIt looked like the 9100. Acted like the 9100. Just with... less.\n\nIt is unknown how well this model sold. It is assumed that it did not sell\nwell.\n\n### The Holborn 6100\n\nIn 1982, the Holborn Computer company had to make some tough decisions.\n\nTheir Holborn OS (booted from ROM), was not proving popular. And the CP/M\noperating system (from Gary Kildall\u2019s Digital Research in Pacific Grove,\nCalifornia) was rapidly gaining in popularity.\n\nLuckily the architecture already in use by Holborn computers (the Z80) had a\nnative version of CP/M.\n\nThus the lower priced, and smaller footprint, Holborn 6100 line was born. Same\nZ80 CPU, and now with a maximum 192 KB of RAM (slightly less than the 9100)...\nbut, this time, booting the CP/M operating system off disk.\n\nNo more booting from ROM. No more in-house developed operating system.\n\nThis is the Holborn 6140 with the connected 6110 terminal. See? Much smaller\nthan that gigantic 9100 mini-fridge. But still retained that fantastically\ninteresting terminal design.\n\nHere is a shot of the Holborn 6100\u2019s screen, running CP/M.\n\nImage courtesy Technisch museum\n\nHow many of these machines shipped? Reports put it somewhere in the ballpark\nof around 100. Total.\n\nThough the lack of information makes this fact difficult to confirm.\nRegardless, it was not exactly selling like hotcakes.\n\n### The Holborn 6500\n\nThe final computer designed by Holborn was the ill-fated 6500.\n\nIn the 6500, Holborn removed the keyboard from the terminal body (making it a\ndetached keyboard), and filled the base of the terminal with the computer guts\n(thus eliminating the need for the separate computer housing used in earlier\nmodels). As shown in this advertisement for the \u201cnot yet released\u201d 6500:\n\nAnd here is a shot of the inside of the Holborn 6500, with the top of the case\nlifted up to show the internals.\n\nImage courtesy: Inexhibit\n\nUnfortunately Holborn Computers declared bankruptcy in April of 1983... before\nshipping the 6500.\n\n### The End of Holborn\n\nAnd here is where things become increasingly sad for the company.\n\nWhen Holborn went bankrupt, investigators determined that only 50 units were\nsold of the 9100 and 7100 combined. And that the company had over 3.5 million\nguilders in debt. (Guilders were the currency in use in The Netherlands prior\nto changing to the Euro. Some quick math tells us that 3.5 Million guilders\nwould be roughly equal to $7 Million USD.)\n\nWould the 6500 model have been enough to save the company? Who knows.\nConsidering the poor sales up till then, and the relatively massive debt (when\ncompared to sales), it seems unlikely.\n\nBut one thing is for certain... those are some seriously funky (and awesome)\nlooking machines. So I\u2019m sure glad they tried.\n\nIf you ever run across a Holborn, count yourself lucky. These are some of the\nhardest computers to find nowadays. Considering that only a few hundred were\never sold, you aren\u2019t likely to stumble across them at a flea market or eBay.\n\nWith that, I leave you with some pictures of Holborn computers in action.\nBecause they're just so darned cool looking.\n\nRead full Article\n\n15\n\nView All\n\n6\n\nReply\n\nBryan Lunduke@Lunduke\n\nMay 02, 2024\n\nFunny Programming Pictures Part XXXVIII\n\nGo ahead. Call them \"memes\". I dare ya.\n\nBlah blah blah. There's too much serious Tech News. Here's some funny pictures\nthat I definitely did not copy and paste from The Inter-Tubes.\n\nClassic.It's funny because CSS is terrible.My favorite part about this is how\nmuch I'm crying inside.Around 20 years ago, a fellow Dev Manager and I were\ninterviewing a guy for a senior level programmer job. We asked him to code a\nsimple function, in C, on the whiteboard. Something that takes a single\nparameter and loops on it. He walked up to the whiteboard and picked up the\nmarker. At which point you could visibly see -- from the back of his head --\nas he had an epic brain fart. He stood there in silence for a moment, turned\naround, pale as a ghost, and announced, \"I forgot\". He then -- and this was\nbrilliant -- handed me the marker and asked me to do it. At which point my\nbrain short circuited and I couldn't -- for the life of me -- remember how to\ndo it either. I start laughing and hand the marker to the other Dev Manager.\nHe just puts up his hands and shakes his head as if to say, \"I can't remember\neither\". That guy got the job. True story.WARNING! WARNING! UNUSED VARIABLE!\nWE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE!I know, I know. I have issues with this picture too. I\nmean. Seriously. Rust would obviously be the toilet.Code reviews are just the\nworst.I don't get it.I'm not saying \"Arrays start at 1\" is correct... it is\nmerely the only non-insane option.Some of my projects have more commented out\nlines of code than not.This is correct.By posting this picture, we have\naccidentally summoned 1,000 Rust programmers. We're all doomed.Let that be a\nlesson: Always set an \"Out of Office\" autoresponce before pushing to\nproduction. Noob.It's has a calculator in it, so this picture is allowed.\nYou're welcome.Semi-related note: I miss when heavily used compiled code, in\nCGI-Bin, on webservers. Those were the days.I like this picture, because it\ncaused me to have 17 contradictory \"Well, actually...\" responses in the span\nof 30 seconds.Malloc! Malloc, like the wind!\"I've come here to program with\nwishy thinking and bubble gum. And I'm all out of bubble gum.\"\n\nRead full Article\n\n26\n\nView All\n\n19\n\nReply\n\nSee More\n\nSign Up To Lunduke\n\nSign Up for free to see more from this community or subscribe to Lunduke for\n$6/month to support Lunduke for more interaction and exclusive content.\n\nLogin Signup\n\nAvailable on mobile and TV devices\n\nPowered by Locals\n\nAbout Community\n\nLunduke\n\n6292 Members\n\nBryan Lunduke@Lunduke\n\nSeptember 22, 2023\n\nLunduke Journal Link Central (tm)\n\nLooking for some of the biggest articles and shows from The Lunduke Journal?\nOr Podcast feeds?
