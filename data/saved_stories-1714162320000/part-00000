Gladwell/Getty Images\n\n\u201cIt has been incredible to watch the growth of this field over the last\ndecade,\u201d says Rahul Satija, a researcher at the New York Genome Center.\nThousands of labs are using single-cell sequencing to profile cells across a\nwide variety of organs and organisms, he says. It\u2019s now a routine method to\nmeasure what cells are doing. scRNA-seq experiments pose \u201ca whole bunch of\nreally exciting, conceptually new problems,\u201d says University of Washington\nresearcher Cole Trapnell, who is also part of the Brotman Baty Institute, a\ncollaboration between the University of Washington, Seattle Children\u2019s\nHospital and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center.\n\nThe rapid rise of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) means researchers can\nfind reviews^1,2,3 and evolving resources such as Single-Cell Best Practices.\nThe book, co-authored by members of the Single-Cell Best Practices Consortium,\naddresses newcomers and advanced professionals alike. Book contributors can\njoin through a Jupyter Notebook.\n\nSatija, a Duke University alumnus and basketball fan, thinks back to a moment\nalmost exactly 13 years ago. \u201cI had the game playing on one monitor while\nmapping our very first sequencing results,\u201d he says. Duke was playing its\nSweet Sixteen basketball game in the annual March Madness National Collegiate\nAthletic Association tournament. At the time, Satija was working with Alex\nShalek and Joshua Levin in Aviv Regev\u2019s lab at the Broad Institute of MIT and\nHarvard. Duke lost the game, and it may be best to not linger on that\nupsetting memory, but that day Satija stayed in the lab to analyze his first\nscRNA-seq results. \u201cI remember the thrill for the first time of realizing that\nthe data we were looking at really came from a single cell,\u201d he says. The\nreadout was from just 18 individual cells, but it felt like a beginning,\nespecially in light of work from labs he calls the early scRNA-seq pioneers:\nthose of Sten Linnarsson at Karolinska Institute and Fuchou Tang, then at the\nUniversity of Cambridge.\n\nHis transformative moment concerning scRNA-seq, says Trapnell, happened as he\nwatched transformation under the microscope. He was mid-postdoctoral\nfellowship and working with stem cells, which showed varied developmental\ntrajectories. It was 2012 or 2013 when he and another postdoc did one of the\nfirst scRNA-seq experiments to study how muscle cells change during\ndevelopment. These cells transform into just one cell type, but what surprised\nhim was to see them change at tremendously different rates. \u201cIt was so obvious\nthat we could even build a whole algorithm that could put them in\ndevelopmental order, just based on looking at how they were changing their\ngenes up and down,\u201d he says. He sensed that soon researchers would have a\npressing need for new software tools and new algorithms. Fast-forward to today\nand one finds more than 1,400 software tools from many labs, including the\nTrapnell team.\n\nAt the Wellcome Sanger Institute, the Teichmann lab focuses on single-cell\ntechniques and the insight they deliver.

Folland / Wellcome Sanger\nInst\n\n## Many tools, sparse data\n\nIndeed, the number of computational scRNA-seq tools is huge, say Sarah\nTeichmann, a researcher at the Wellcome Sanger Institute who co-founded and\nco-directs the Human Cell Atlas, and who responded jointly with colleagues\nKerstin Meyer and Nick England. Given the rapid advance of technologies in\nthis space, with sequencing instruments and barcoding techniques for spatial,\nproteomic and metabolic data, \u201cthere is still a great need for new tools,\u201d\nthey note. Users want to analyze and combine results that are from different\ninformation modalities.\n\nThe previous software stack for gene expression analysis \u201cjust wasn\u2019t going to\ncut it,\u201d says Trapnell; tools need to address scRNA-seq data structures. For\nideas, one can port methods from other fields. scRNA-seq experimenters face\nsimilar statistics issues to ones ecologists face when they count organisms at\ndifferent locations. To resolve gene expression spatially, one can look at the\nway geology tools address an inference problem well-known in statistics to\nassess at what layer of rock an oil field begins and ends. \u201cPeople are doing\nthat, which is pretty cool,\u201d he says. It\u2019s not a conceptually new method, but\n\u201cbut it\u2019s conceptually new to biology in a lot of ways.\u201d\n\nThe sparseness of scRNA-seq data continues to be challenging, say Teichmann\nand her colleagues. Often, too few transcripts are captured. Imputing the\nmissing values is a way to handle this^4 with methods that apply statistical\nmodels or deep learning, among others. While imputation can increase\nsensitivity for detecting differential expression, \u201cit can also introduce\nfalse positives,\u201d they say, noting this is a point that colleagues make in a\npaper^5. In that paper, Tallulah Andrews and Martin Hemberg, who are also at\nWellcome Sanger Institute, evaluate different imputation methods for their\nrisk of generating \u201cfalse positive or irreproducible differential expression\nwhen imputing data.\u201d Those authors, the Teichmann team indicates, recommend\nthat imputation can be useful in some instances, such as to visualize data,\nbut for statistical tests, such as for differential expression analysis,\nunimputed data should be used.\n\n\u201cImputation is widely used in human genetics where there are good known\nreference datasets,\u201d such as from the 1000 Genomes Project, say Teichmann and\ncolleagues. As more scRNA-seq reference atlases become available, new methods\ncould leverage them for more accurate imputation.\n\n\u201cImputation, particularly at the level of the individual measurements, is kind\nof a fraught thing to do,\u201d says Trapnell. It\u2019s a way to express doubts about a\nvalue that, according to the assay, is zero but might be small. The doubts and\nthe guessing have to be carried through the statistical analysis, and \u201cyou\nhave to kind of propagate the uncertainty.\u201d\n\nThe alternative, he says, is measuring many more cells to \u201cfill in the\nzeroes.\u201d To do so takes time and money, but with technology advances, he hopes\nthis will become easier. The \u2018get more cells\u2019 strategy is better than spending\ntime to develop an algorithm that can quickly become obsolete. His lab\ndeveloped Census, a scRNA-seq imputation tool. Once barcoding techniques with\nunique molecular identifiers (UMIs) came into wide use, the algorithm was no\nlonger needed.\n\n## Better now\n\nAmplification bias was an issue, but UMIs \u201chave solved this conundrum,\u201d say\nthe Teichmann lab team. The method lends each gene a unique barcode. \u201cAfter\namplification, reads with the same UMI are collapsed into a single read, thus\nremoving any amplification bias.\u201d\n\nKarolinska Institute researcher Rickard Sandberg and colleagues note that\nerrors within barcodes can occur, which must be corrected. Given the lack of\nexperimental ground truths to help with that correction, they developed mRNA\nspike-ins that have highly diverse random sequences. They note^6 that UMIs\nshorter than eight nucleotides should be avoided except for shallow scRNA-seq\nexperiments.\n\nSome labs previously excluded the effect of cell cycle state on scRNA-seq\ndata, as a confounder, but no longer do so, says applied statistician Kasper\nHansen. He and colleagues at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public\nHealth developed Tricycle: Transferable Representation and Inference of Cell\nCycle. It\u2019s a tool with which one can infer cell cycle state from scRNA-seq\ndata.\n\nDuring the cell cycle, many genes are differentially expressed, especially as\nthe cell grows and increases its RNA content before cell division. Not only\nthe genes regulating the cell cycle change. The team, says Hansen, amassed\nmuch evidence that Tricycle works well in mammalian cells. \u201cIf you use a more\ndistant organism, we would love to hear your experience,\u201d he says.\n\nCurrently, users apply Tricycle to estimate cell cycle length, but it could\nreveal more about the interplay between cell cycle length, differentiation and\ncell fate. \u201cWe are actively working on this question,\u201d he says. In their\nmethod development work, the team confirmed Tricycle\u2019s results by comparing\nthem to gold-standard cell cycle measurements. For technical reasons such\ndatasets profile only a single proliferating cell type, but \u201cwhat we need are\nmethods which work on mixtures of cell types,\u201d he says.\n\nAs scRNA seq emerged, some labs used highly sensitive methods such as RNA\nfluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to probe and localize RNAs in cells\nor tissue sections. They counted individual mRNA molecules and came across\n\u201cthe bursty nature of gene expression regulation,\u201d says Trapnell, which was\nand is intriguing. FISH remains a great way to study the mechanics of\ntranscription.\n\nOver time, says Trapnell, scientists have learned that the cells contain much\nRNA, yet not many molecules are needed to \u201cget a pretty clear idea of at least\nwhat kind of a cell a cell is, and maybe even where it is.\u201d Genes are\ncorrelated, and from an information theory or statistical perspective, a\nfraction of a cell\u2019s RNA content is telling. This has been a technical\nsurprise to the scientific community, he says. scRNA-seq has enabled an era of\ncell atlas making.\n\n## Paths to scale-up\n\nWhen prepping samples for scRNA-seq, tissue dissociation can bias the\nproportion of retrieved cell types, says the Teichmann lab team. But scRNA-seq\ndelivers, in their view, the highest quality data, and experimenters can find\nsubtle gene expression differences and characterize small subpopulations.\nSingle-nucleus sequencing \u201cis much less prone to bias,\u201d the researchers note,\nand the technique more faithfully represents the intact tissue\u2019s cell\npopulations, \u201calbeit with a slightly lower gene count,\u201d the team says.\n\nBecause every assay in biology has bias, says Trapnell, one needs internally\nconsistent controls. Cells and nuclei are different beasts. And a cell has\nmore RNA than just the nucleus alone. If a researcher wants to count how many\ncells of each type a sample contains, \u201cnuclei are just fine for that,\u201d says\nTrapnell. Both scRNA-seq and single-nucleus RNA-seq have their place and\nlimitations. To know which genes were expressed an hour ago, as opposed to\nyesterday, \u201cnuclei are maybe even better for that.\u201d\n\nThe Teichmann lab and colleagues have combined scRNA-seq with recently\nimproved spatial technologies that now offer \u201ctrue single-cell resolution.\u201d\nThey mention the 10x Genomics Xenium and Visium HD systems as examples. For\nmany experiments^7, the Teichmann lab integrates data from scRNA-seq, single-\nnucleus RNA-seq and spatially resolved transcriptomics. They combined scRNA-\nseq and 10X Genomics Visium data in their work on limb development, for which\nthey built a spatially resolved single-cell atlas.\n\nTogether with colleagues in the UK, Germany and Australia, the team developed\nthe WebAtlas pipeline^8 for sharing integrated single-cell datasets. One can\nquery cell types and genes across single-cell data, as well as sequencing and\nimaging-based data. The datasets they applied their approach to include scRNA-\nseq data and datasets acquired with spatial technologies: 10x Genomics Visium\nCytAssist and Xenium, Vizgen\u2019s MERSCOPE and a mouse embryonic dataset\ngenerated with seqFISH developed in the Cai lab at California Institute of\nTechnology.\n\nIn scRNA-seq, rapid scale-up is underway, say the Teichmann team. Companies\nsuch as 10x Genomics provide chips for loading 100,000 cells per inlet. Some\ncompanies use combinatorial indexing, which allows analysis of large numbers\nof cells at reasonable cost. Combinatorial indexing involves numerous rounds\nof barcoding of cells and analytes, and that scales up scRNA-seq experiments.\nOne company the Teichman team mentions is Parse Biosciences. Another company\nin this space is Scale Biosciences, which Trapnell co-founded with University\nof Washington colleague Jay Shendure, Stanford University\u2019s Garry Nolan and\nFrank Steemers, who was previously at Illumina.\n\nYuhan Hao, while a PhD student in the Satija lab, co-developed a bridge\nintegration strategy for multimodal single-cell data analysis. Credit: Neptune\nBio\n\n## Integration in action\n\nSays Satija, it\u2019s exciting how possible it is now to get different types of\nmolecular information from individual cells \u2014 gene expression as well as\nprotein abundance, chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation levels.\n\u201cMeasuring these other modalities provides a very different view of what the\ncell is doing, and can even be used to infer its past behavior or to predict\nits future state,\u201d he says.\n\nThe Satija lab has developed a bridge integration approach^9 to integrate\nsingle-cell datasets across modalities. In their paper, they consider two\ndatasets generated from immune cells in people with COVID: RNA levels, which\nare cellular gene expression, and cellular protein level measurements. Each\ncell in a multiomic set of data is an \u2018element\u2019 in a dictionary. Dictionary\nlearning is how translation between RNA and protein data is handled so the two\nsets can be integrated, says Satija. The method is implemented in the Seurat\npackage, a widely used single-cell data analysis suite of tools from the lab.\n\nThe method focuses intensive processing and integration on a select group of\nrepresentative cells, says Yuhan Hao, who heads data science at the biotech\nNeptune Bio and co-led this method\u2019s development as a PhD student in the\nSatija lab. These results are extended to represent the entire dataset. This\nshortens the otherwise extensive analysis time needed when integrating ten\nlarge scRNA-seq datasets with millions of cells that require much\ncomputational memory. \u201cThis process effectively brings datasets of different\ntypes into a common feature space, making integration straightforward,\u201d he\nsays.\n\nThis method sits at the heart of the lab\u2019s Azimuth portal. It emerged as part\nof their activities in the Human Biomolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP), which\naims to map the human body at single-cell level. Azimuth offers annotated\nreference datasets that help with automated processing and analysis. There are\nreference scRNA-seq datasets of various types of human cells and scATAC-seq\ndata. The method scATAC-seq, or transposase-accessible chromatin through\nsequencing, is a way to assess where transcription factors bind or where DNA\nmethylation occurs.\n\nscRNA-seq experiments pose \u201ca whole bunch of really exciting, conceptually new\nproblems,\u201d says University of Washington researcher Cole Trapnell. Credit:\nBrotman Baty Inst\n\n## New vistas\n\nEspecially because of plummeting sequencing costs, the overall costs of scRNA-\nseq experiments have dropped, says Trapnell. And whereas what used to be a\ntypical experiment involved a few hundred cells from tissue from which cells\ncould be readily disassociated, these days, experiments can be run with\nmillions of cells from many specimens. Most early applications focused on\nregulation of individual genes. Such work continues, but scRNA-seq scale-up\nand throughput have opened up new experimental possibilities.\n\nInstead of perturbing cells and asking \u201chow does my favorite gene change?\u201d or\nhow individual genes are regulated, one can perturb model organism embryos and\nask how a favorite cell type changes in proportion to other cell types. One\ngets a sense of the overall program because one can study how cell types\ndepend on one another. One might be studying cancer cells to study residual\ndisease. \u201cIt\u2019s like using single-cell RNA-seq like one would use flow\ncytometry,\u201d he says. \u201cBut on a much larger scale.\u201d These changes make it\neasier to design experiments.\n\nThe Trapnell and the Shendure lab have been applying scRNA-seq to\ndevelopmental biology questions^10,11. This work will be scaled up in their\nwork at SeaHub, the new Seattle Hub for Synthetic Biology. Shendure is\nSeaHub\u2019s scientific director and Trapnell will co-lead.\n\nWhen you can sequence millions of cells from different specimens \u2014 in their\ncases, embryos of model organisms that have been perturbed in various ways \u2014\none can study how a change affects all cell types across the development of\nthe embryo, says Trapnell, and begin addressing problems in genetics and\ndevelopmental genetics one could not address with more conventional tools.\nAlong with new tools to address computational and statistical problems, such\nas for inferring which genes are required for which cell types, how the cell\ntypes depend on one another, or how the genes regulate one another, \u201cI think\nit\u2019s going to provide us with a means of dissecting the genetic program that\ncontrols development.\u201d\n\nPlenty of technical issues remain to be solved in scRNA-seq measurement and\nanalysis, says Hao. \u201cWe need the scRNA data at the population level with\ngenetic and curated clinical information,\u201d he says. Last year, the Chan\nZuckerberg Initiative consolidated publicly available scRNA-seq data to build\nCZ CellxGene Discover Census, with which one can access, query and analyze\nscRNA-seq data. These data are invaluable for training AI models to learn the\nunified representation of all those cells. It would be useful, he says, to\nhave data about the donors of these cells while also maintaining privacy.\n\nMuch exciting work is ongoing with scRNA-seq, says Hansen. Sequencing assays\nare tough to validate since measuring cells destroys them. He is glad to see\nmethods that record the history of the cell before measurement, such as\nPhylotime, a retrospective lineage barcoding and analysis tool developed by\nhis Hopkins colleagues Reza Kalhor and Hongkai Ji and their groups.\n\nIt\u2019s particularly useful to see the increase in spatial resolution that\ntechnologies are bringing, say Teichmann and her colleagues. This, along with\nnew tools, will let scientists precisely map gene expression to individual\ncells at their exact location. For instance, understanding the exact cellular\ninteractions between immune cells and their targets in cancer and autoimmune\ndiseases holds much promise for treatment and drug discovery.\n\nThe research community, says Hao, has used scRNA-seq to identify and describe\nnovel, rare and previously overlooked cell types. This opens a way to\nunderstand cell types and gene programs that lead to complex diseases and thus\npower therapeutics development. But one needs scRNA data not just from from\ntens to hundreds of individuals but thousands of individuals, says Hao.\nLowering costs of scRNA increases its accessibility, and among the next\ntechnical challenges is determining how to collect information about the\nindividuals who donated their cells and maintain privacy.\n\nThe next frontier, in Satija\u2019s view, is to move beyond observation and\nleverage these technologies \u201cto understand not just what cells are doing, but\nwhy they are doing it.\u201d This is a new direction his lab is taking. One\ntechnique from this new direction is the team\u2019s Phospho-seq, to simultaneously\nprofile proteins, quantify intracellular protein dynamics, use scATAC-seq in\nwhole cells, and then integrate these data with scRNA-seq datasets using the\nbridge integration method.\n\nOne can track cell signaling during development and reconstruct gene-\nregulatory relationships this way. The lab has also begun large-scale\nexperiments^12 to identify the regulators and targets of diverse cellular\nresponses. This work involves pooled genetic screens, single-cell sequencing\nsuch as use of Perturb-seq combined with combinatorial indexing, and high-\nthroughput sequencing to find targets of signaling regulators in different\nbiological contexts. More than 1,500 individual perturbations are performed\nacross six cell lines and five different biological signaling contexts.\n\nWith CaRPool-seq, the lab has combined use of CRISPR and single-cell genomics\ntechnologies to massively parallelize the measurement of cellular responses\nunder high-throughput genetic perturbations, and those perturbations can\ninvolve either single genes or multiple genes.\n\nScale will keep rising and cost is likely to keep dropping. It helps that\nscRNA-seq can be performed with much less material than used to be needed and\non a wider range of tissues, says Trapnell. One can do things, he says, that\nwere \u201coff limits before.\u201d\n\nWhat trips people up the most in scRNA-seq work, says Trapnell, is study\ndesign. It has been too expensive for scientists to do the study they want, so\nthey do a different experiment. \u201cI think that what\u2019s really going to change in\nthe next couple years is that now people will be able to do the study they\nwant,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s going to be really enabling for a lot of labs.\u201d\n\n## References\n\n  1.
