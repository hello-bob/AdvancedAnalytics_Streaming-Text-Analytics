It was originally developed as a\nsimple offline fallback for OpenStreetMap tiles.\n\nWith 1k Github stars in the first week and quite a few websites immediately\nadapting the map, the reception was very positive.\n\n## Stealing Vertices From Fjords\n\nAt the same time, it was clear that a less coarse map would be preferred. In\nthe days following the release, people gently reminded us that both the\nCaspian Sea and the Great Lakes were shown as land, that many islands were\nmissing, that half of our (not their, our) home country looked like it was\nabout to drift into sea, and that some UK towns were already underwater.\n\nIn tinyworldmap\u2019s third release, this has all been fixed. Scroll horizontally\nto see the original version:\n\nAlthough the additional detail has resulted in a slightly bigger file (~450K\ngzipped), most of the vertices were obtained by smoothing sparsely populated\nareas with complex shorelines. We dedicated considerable effort to ensure the\nsmoothed shores blend into the overall map style.\n\n## Altering the Map Appearance\n\nYou can now do this:\n\n1000 km\n\n500 mi\n\nLeaflet | \u00a9 tinyworldmap, OpenStreetMap\n\nFor every map layer, any property can be set on the canvas rendering context.\nMore info can be found in our documentation. Of course, because the map is\nrendered client-side, excessive use of shadows, filters and textures will slow\ndown older devices.\n\n## A Note On Custom-Content Maps\n\nWe have received a lot of questions from people who would like to create\ncustom-content maps themselves. Road maps, city maps, detail maps, translated\nmaps, you name it.\n\nCurrently, the only way to obtain a custom map is by hiring us. I\u2019d love to\ndocument and open-source the code, and make the entire process more\nreproducible and less dependent on manual changes, but that requires both a\nlot of time and may hurt our business. In other words, we would need an\nalternative source of funding.\n\nIf you are interested in providing funding or if you know of an organization\nthat might be, let us know!\n\n\u00a9 tinyworldmap\n\n", "frontpage": false}
