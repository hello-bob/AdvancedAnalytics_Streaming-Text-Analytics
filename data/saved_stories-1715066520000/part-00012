This framework helps manage the risks of AI so that we can seize\nits benefits in synthetic biology.\n\nThrough the AI executive order, President Biden has directed action on AI\nacross the economy, including AI applied to biotechnology and synthetic\nbiology. Nucleic acids serve as the critical building blocks for life science\nresearch and development (R&D) \u2014including the development of new biomedical\nproducts, novel strategies for recycling and energy production, and the\ncreation of new classes of materials. It is essential that nucleic acid\nsynthesis technologies are appropriately managed to promote positive outcomes\nand prevent nefarious uses. Nucleic acid synthesis screening is an effective,\ntargeted measure to mitigate the potential for misuse of AI-enabled\nbiotechnologies.\n\nThis framework recommends that providers of synthetic nucleic acids screen\npurchases to prevent misuse, building on recent guidance from the Department\nof Health and Human Services. The National Institute of Standards and\nTechnology will further support implementation of this framework by engaging\nwith industry to develop technical standards for screening, as directed by the\nExecutive Order.\n\nAs directed by the Executive Order, within 180 days of the release of this\nframework, federal research funding agencies will require recipients of\nfederal R&D funds to procure synthetic nucleic acids only from providers that\nimplement these best practices. While this framework establishes requirements\nfor federally funded research, it is anticipated that these requirements may\nbe adopted more broadly by other research funders.\n\nThe Framework for Nucleic Acid Synthesis Screening can be found here.\n\n###\n\n## Stay Connected\n\nOpt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.\n\nShare\n\n  * Share this page on Facebook\n  * Share this page on X\n  * https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2024/04/29/framework-for-nucleic-acid-synthesis-screening/?utm_source=link\n\nThe White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW Washington, DC 20500\n\nWH.gov\n\nScroll to Top\n\nTop\n\n", "frontpage": false}
