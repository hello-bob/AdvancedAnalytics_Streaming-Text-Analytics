However, there are anecdotal reports of individuals who seem\nimmune to age-related memory impairment, but these individuals have not been\nstudied systematically. This study sought to establish that such cognitive\nSuperAgers exist and to determine if they were also resistant to age-related\nloss of cortical brain volume. SuperAgers were defined as individuals over age\n80 with episodic memory performance at least as good as normative values for\n50- to 65-year-olds. Cortical morphometry of the SuperAgers was compared to\ntwo cognitively normal cohorts: age-matched elderly and 50- to 65-year-olds.\nThe SuperAgers\u2019 cerebral cortex was significantly thicker than their healthy\nage-matched peers and displayed no atrophy compared to the 50- to 65-year-old\nhealthy group. Unexpectedly, a region of left anterior cingulate cortex was\nsignificantly thicker in the SuperAgers than in both elderly and middle-aged\ncontrols. Our findings identify cognitive and neuroanatomical features of a\ncohort that appears to resist average age-related changes of memory capacity\nand cortical volume. A better understanding of the underlying factors\npromoting this potential trajectory of unusually successful aging may provide\ninsight for preventing age-related cognitive impairments or the more severe\nchanges associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. (JINS, 2012, 18, 1081\u20131085)\n\nKeywords: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Neuropsychology,\nDementia, Freesurfer, Elderly, Neuroimaging\n\nGo to:\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nWhen used to describe older adults, the concept of \u201ccognitively normal-for-\nage\u201d suggests that decline is normal. That is, scores considered \u201cnormal\u201d for\nan 80-year-old on many cognitive measures are markedly lower than normal\nscores for a 50-year-old, especially for tests of episodic memory (for a\ndiscussion on this concept, see Evans, Grodstein, Loewenstein, Kaye, &\nWeintraub, 2011). What is poorly understood is whether age-related decline is\ninevitable beyond age 80 or whether there is an alternative trajectory that\nresists the cognitive and anatomic changes characteristic of normal aging.\n\nThis question was addressed in a prospective study of individuals called\nSuperAgers, aged 80 or older, selected for scores on tests of episodic memory\nthat were above-average-for-age, at a level considered at least normal for\nindividuals 20\u201330 years younger, and whose scores in other cognitive domains\nwere at least average-for-age. While several studies of successful aging exist\n(for relevant reviews, see Depp & Jeste, 2006; Kaup, Mirzakhanian, Jeste, &\nEyler, 2011; Rowe & Kahn, 1997), few incorporate cognitive function into their\ndefinition and none require memory performance to be at least as good as those\nof individuals two to three decades younger.\n\nThis study examined whether the SuperAgers\u2019 cortical morphometry was distinct\nfrom typical age-related atrophy by quantitatively comparing their structural\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to those of two cognitively normal\nreference groups: elderly controls and middle-aged controls.\n\nGo to:\n\n## METHODS\n\n### Participants\n\nParticipants were identified based on chronologic age (Super-Agers: \u226580 years\nold, Middle-aged Controls: 50\u201365 years old, Elderly Controls: age-matched to\nSuperAger cohort), availability of a 3 Tesla (T) structural MRI scan and\nneuropsychological performance (described below). All participants were\nrequired to have preserved activities of daily living and lacked clinical or\nstructural evidence of neurologic or psychiatric disease.\n\nSuperAgers and middle-aged controls were community dwellers, recruited through\nNorthwestern\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Center (ADC) Clinical Core, community\nlectures, and word of mouth. Twelve SuperAgers and 14 middle-aged controls met\nour criteria and were included in the analysis.\n\nSince Northwestern\u2019s ADC does not routinely perform structural MRI scans on\nhealthy elderly participants, data were obtained through the Alzheimer\u2019s\nDisease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Cognitively normal and\nimpaired individuals have been recruited into ADNI from over 50 sites across\nthe United States and Canada, including Northwestern\u2019s ADC, and their imaging\nand neuropsychological data are made available to approved investigators\n(http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/). Eleven individuals met criteria; one participant\nwas subsequently excluded because their MRI data contained fatal defects.\n\nWritten informed consent was obtained for all participants, which was approved\nby the IRB of each participating center.\n\nThe neuropsychological measures were chosen on the basis of their relevance\nfor cognitive aging and for early detection of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD)\n(Weintraub, Wicklund, & Salmon, 2011). The delayed verbal recall score of the\nRey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) was used to assess episodic memory.\nSuperAgers were required to perform at or above average normative values for\nindividuals in their 50s and 60s (midpoint age = 61; RAVLT delayed-recall raw\nscore \u22659) (Schmidt, 2004), while healthy middle-aged controls and elderly\ncontrols were required to score within one standard deviation of the average\nrange for their age and education according to published normative values\n(Figure 1A; Schmidt, 2004). The 30-item Boston Naming Test (BNT; Kaplan,\nGoodglass, & Weintraub, 1983), Trail Making Test Part B (Randolph, 1998), and\nthe Category Fluency Test (Morris et al., 1989) were used to assess cognitive\nfunction in non-memory domains. All participants were required to score within\none standard deviation of the average range for their age and education on\neach of these measures according to published normative values (Heaton,\nMiller, Taylor, & Grant, 2004; Randolph, 1998; Saxton et al., 2000).\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFig. 1\n\nEpisodic memory performance and differences in cortical thickness by group.\n(a) Group average delayed recall scores on the RAVLT word list show SuperAgers\nperforming significantly better than elderly controls. There is no significant\ndifference in episodic memory performance between SuperAgers and middle-aged\ncontrols. The solid and dotted lines represent the average normative values\nfor a 60-year-old and an 80-year-old, respectively (Schmidt, 2004). *\nrepresents significant differences at p <.05. (b) Red and yellow represent\nsignificantly thinner cortex in elderly controls compared to middle-aged\ncontrols. (c) There is no significant thinning in the SuperAging group in\neither hemisphere compared to middle-aged controls. A region within the\nanterior cingulate (blue) is significantly thicker in SuperAgers when compared\nto middle-aged controls. (d) Red and yellow represent significantly thinner\ncortex in elderly controls compared to SuperAgers. False discovery rate (FDR)\nwas set at 0.05 for each MRI analysis. Color bars display significance using\nas \u2212log(10) p value.\n\n### MRI Acquisition\n\nAll subjects received T1-weighted three-dimensional MP-RAGE sequences (TR =\n2300 ms, TE = 2.86 ms, flip angle = 9\u00b0, FoV = 256 mm) (Jack et al., 2008).\nCortical thickness was calculated by measuring the distance between\nrepresentations of the white-gray and pial-CSF boundaries across each point of\nthe cortical surface using the image analysis suite FreeSurfer (version 4.5.0;\nhttp://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/; Fischl & Dale, 2000). This sensitive and\nwell-validated method uses both intensity and continuity information from the\nentire MR volume, and produces thickness maps capable of detecting\nsubmillimeter differences between groups (Kuperberg et al., 2003).\n\n### Statistical Analysis\n\nStatistical surface maps were generated using a general linear model that\ndisplays differences in cortical thickness between two groups for each vertex\nalong the surface representations. A false discovery rate of 0.05 was used to\nadjust for multiple comparisons (Genovese, Lazar, & Nichols, 2002).\n\nCortical volume, a summary measure of cortical integrity (Desikan et al.,\n2006), was calculated for each participant, normalized by intracranial volume\n(Buckner et al., 2004) and compared between groups using an analysis of\nvariance (ANOVA). Pearson correlations were used to examine the relationship\nbetween cortical morphometry measures and memory performance.\n\nAll statistical analyses were performed within FreeSurfer or with PASW 19.0\n(SPSS).\n\nGo to:\n\n## RESULTS\n\nTwelve SuperAgers (average age = 83.5 \u00b13.0 years), 10 elderly controls\n(average age = 83.1 \u00b13.4 years), and 14 middle-aged controls (average age =\n57.9 \u00b14.3 years) were included in the analyses. There were no significant\ndifferences in education among the groups (average years of education for\nSuper-Agers = 14.8 \u00b12.4, elderly controls = 17.5 \u00b12.2, middle-aged controls =\n16.1 \u00b12.9).\n\nAs defined by our experimental design, episodic memory performance for the\nelderly and middle-aged controls was within one standard deviation of\npublished normative values (Schmidt, 2004), while SuperAgers\u2019 performed at\nleast as well as middle-aged controls (p = .09) and significantly better than\nelderly controls (p <.001; Figure 1A). All participants scored at least within\none standard deviation of the average range for their age and education on\nnon-memory testing, confirming the absence of cognitive impairment. One-way\nANOVAs showed significant differences between the three groups on Trails B but\nnot on Category Fluency or the BNT (Trails B: F = 4.1, p = .027, Average Score\nSuper-Agers = 96.2 \u00b146.1, Middle Age Controls = 61.8 \u00b122.0, Elderly Controls =\n128.5 \u00b192.7; Category Fluency: F = 3.0, p = .064, Average Score SuperAgers =\n22.4 \u00b16.0, Middle Age Controls = 23.7 \u00b15.6, Elderly Controls = 18.4 \u00b13.8; BNT:\nF = 0.9, p = .424, Average Score SuperAgers = 28.7 \u00b11.1 Middle Age Controls =\n28.9 \u00b11.0, Elderly Controls = 28.0 \u00b12.5). Post hoc tests revealed that the\nelderly controls were significantly slower than the middle-aged controls (p\n<.05) on Trails B but there were no other significant differences between the\ngroups. Thus, as a group, the SuperAgers did not differ from the middle-aged\ncontrols on non-memory performance.\n\n### Middle-Aged Controls Versus Elderly Controls\n\nThe whole-brain cortical thickness comparison conducted between elderly\ncontrols and middle-aged controls revealed, as expected, significant atrophy\nin the older cohort in multiple regions across the frontal, parietal and\noccipital lobes, including medial temporal regions important for memory\nfunction (Figure 1B). This pattern of atrophy in the cognitively normal\nelderly controls is consistent with previous findings (e.g., Salat et al.,\n2004), and presumably reflects the anatomical substrate of the age-related\ndecline of cognitive function, including memory performance, as shown in\nFigure 1A.\n\nIn accordance with the whole-brain cortical thickness results, the average\nnormalized cortical volume was significantly smaller in elderly controls\ncompared to middle-aged controls (Average Volume: elderly controls = 244.13\nmm^3; middle-aged controls = 306.43 mm^3; p <.001).\n\n### SuperAgers Versus Middle-Aged Controls\n\nSurprisingly, the whole-brain cortical thickness analysis comparing SuperAgers\nand middle-aged controls did not reveal significant atrophy in the SuperAgers\n(Figure 1C). In addition, an area located in the left anterior cingulate\n(central estimated Talairach coordinates: \u22126, 10, 26) was thicker in\nSuperAgers than in middle-aged controls\n(http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/CoordinateSystems). The average\nthickness of this region was quantified for each group and is shown in Figure\n2.\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nFig. 2\n\nQuantification of the left hemisphere anterior cingulate region by group. (a)\nInflated medial surface of left hemisphere shows the anterior cingulate\nregion, identified in the whole-brain group comparison (Figure 1B) as\nsignificantly thicker in SuperAgers than in middle-aged controls. (b) Boxplots\nof average left hemisphere anterior cingulate thickness data by group. *\nrepresents significant differences in average thickness at p <.05.\n\nResults from the whole-brain normalized cortical volume analysis were similar\nto the whole-brain cortical thickness analysis, demonstrating no statistically\nsignificant differences between the SuperAgers and middle-aged controls\n(Average Volume: SuperAgers = 288.05 mm^3; middle-aged controls = 306.43 mm^3;\np = .08).\n\n### SuperAgers Versus Elderly Controls\n\nAs expected from the results above, a comparison of healthy elderly controls\nand SuperAgers revealed areas of significant cortical thinning in the former\ngroup (Figure 1D). The cortical volume measures corroborated the thickness\nfindings, showing SuperAgers had significantly larger normalized cortical\nvolumes than their peer group of elderly controls (Average Volume: SuperAgers\n= 288.05 mm^3; elderly controls = 244.13 mm^3; p <.001).\n\n### Relationships Between Memory Performance and Brain Morphometry\n\nSeparate Pearson correlations were used to assess the relationship between\nepisodic memory performance (i.e., RAVLT delay score) and cortical brain\nmeasures (i.e., normalized cortical volume and cingulate thickness) across the\ngroups. Results showed a significant positive correlation between average\nnormalized cortical volume and episodic memory performance (r = 0.532; p =\n.001) but no relationship between episodic memory performance and thickness of\nthe cingulate.\n\nGo to:\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nWe identified octogenarians and nonagenarians with superior memory function\ncompared to their age-matched cognitively normal peers and found anatomic\nfeatures associated with SuperAging that deviated from those associated with\nnormal cognitive aging. The SuperAgers showed significantly greater cortical\nthickness and volume than their cognitively normal age-matched peers and\nshowed no significant cortical atrophy when compared to younger, cognitively\nintact individuals 20\u201330 years younger (50- to 65-year-olds). These findings\nare remarkable given the numerous reports that grey matter loss is a common,\nif not universal, part of normal aging (Drachman, 2006; Fjell et al., 2006;\nSalat et al., 2004). Although the relationship between structural MRI-based\ncortical thickness measures and cellular morphology is not entirely\nunderstood, the lack of atrophy in SuperAgers may be taken as a proxy measure\nof preserved cortical neuronal integrity.\n\nIn addition to the absence of age-related cortical atrophy, our data also\nsuggest that SuperAging may be associated with an unusual prominence of the\ncingulate cortex (Figure 2). At this point it is unclear whether SuperAgers\nwere born with a particularly thick cortex or whether they resisted cortical\nchange over time. Multiple lines of evidence converge toward the conclusion\nthat the cingulate constitutes a critical site of trans-modal integration\nrelated to episodic memory, spatial attention, cognitive control, and\nmotivational modulation (Mesulam, 2009; Mesulam, 1998). In our study,\ncingulate thickness was not directly correlated with memory performance, which\nis not surprising since the cingulate is not known as a primary component of\nthe episodic memory circuitry. However, it is possible that the cingulate may\nmediate resistance of memory circuits to the deleterious processes of aging.\n\nThe posterior segment of the cingulate gyrus has recently received\nconsiderable attention in relationship to the patho-physiology and temporal\nevolution of AD. For example, cingulate hypometabolism as measured by\nmetabolic positron emission tomography (PET) is one of the earliest correlates\nof neuronal dysfunction in AD (Minoshima et al., 1997) and in vivo amyloid\nimaging with PET shows early accumulation of amyloid in the cingulate gyrus of\nAD patients (Fripp et al., 2008; Sperling et al., 2009). Likewise, functional\nMR data suggest that the cingulate cortex is an important component of a\nlarge-scale resting-state network, which shows abnormalities early in the\ncourse of AD (Buckner et al., 2009; Sperling et al., 2009). Thus, normal\ncingulate function appears to be important for the integrity of multiple\ncognitive domains, and the SuperAgers\u2019 superior episodic memory function may\nreflect, at least in part, the presence of a more extensively developed\ncingulate region that is also physiologically more resilient to age- and AD-\nrelated pathology.\n\nWhile recording systematic and detailed medical and demographic histories of\nthe SuperAgers we found no reason to suspect that they had unusually superior\nmemory abilities when younger. In fact, their level of education was not\nabnormally high, only 4 of the 12 SuperAgers obtained a college degree. The\nfindings in this cohort of cognitive SuperAgers provide \u2018proof of concept\u2019\nthat maintenance of superior memory together with cortical integrity is a\nbiological possibility. Identifying the underlying factors that promote this\ntrajectory of unusually successful cognitive aging may lead to novel insights\nfor preventing age-related cognitive impairments or strategies for evading the\nmore severe changes associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nGo to:\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThis project was supported by a grant from The Davee Foundation and the\nNorthwestern University Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Core Center grant from the\nNational Institute on Aging (AG13854).
