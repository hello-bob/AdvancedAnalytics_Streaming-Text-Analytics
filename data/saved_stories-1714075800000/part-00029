Tencent QQ Pinyin, Baidu IME, iFlytek IME, Samsung\nKeyboard on Android, Xiaomi (with keyboard apps from Baidu, iFlytek, and\nSogou), OPPO, Vivo, Honor, all of these allowed potential threat actors to\ndecrypt Chinese mobile users' keystrokes, completely passively, and without\nthe users needing to send any extra network traffic.\n\nThe team says it believes the keyboard apps found on these devices were\n\u201crevealing the contents of users\u2019 keystrokes in transit\u201d.\n\n## Keeping private talk private\n\nThe only manufacturer whose keyboard app was secure is Huawei, the researchers\nsaid. As for Apple and Google, neither app has a feature to transmit\nkeystrokes to cloud servers for cloud-based communications, it was said, which\nmade it impossible to analyze the keyboards for the security of the feature.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM techradar\n\n\u201cHowever, we observed that none of the mobile devices that we analyzed\nincluded Google\u2019s keyboard, Gboard, preinstalled, either,\u201d the researchers\nclaim.\n\nThe researchers disclosed their findings to the manufacturers and say that as\nof April 1, almost all have addressed their issues. Only Honor and Tencent (QQ\nPinyin) still remain a work in progress.\n\nTo defend from potential eavesdroppers, users should keep their apps and\nmobile operating systems updated, and use a keyboard that fully works on the\ndevice. Developers, on the other hand, are advised to use well-tested and\nstandard encryption protocols, instead of building their own, potentially\nvulnerable versions, The Hacker News reports.\n\n## Are you a pro?
