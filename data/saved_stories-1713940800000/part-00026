It has since emerged that these discrepancies were due to IT\nproblems in the Horizon computer system.\n\nSusan Crichton, a former senior lawyer at the Post Office between 2010 and\n2013, told the inquiry that an independent investigation by the forensic\naccountants Second Sight had identified bugs in Horizon by July 2013.\n\nPost Office was urged by external lawyers to \u2018suppress\u2019 key document, inquiry\nhears\n\nRead more\n\nThe inquiry was shown an email by Vennells, sent in July 2013 to Mark Davies,\nthe Post Office\u2019s then head of communications, in which Vennells said she had\nasked her \u201cengineer/computer literate husband\u201d to help find a \u201cnon-emotive\nword for computer bugs\u201d.\n\nHer email to Davies read: \u201cMy engineer/computer literate husband sent the\nfollowing reply to the question: \u2018What is a non-emotive word for computer\nbugs, glitches, defects that happen as a matter of course?\u2019\u201d\n\nHer husband replied: \u201cException or anomaly. You can also say conditional\nexception/anomaly which only manifests itself under unforeseen circumstances.\u201d\n\nProblems with post office branches were later referred to as \u201cbranch\nexceptions\u201d rather than \u201cbugs\u201d in a note prepared for a meeting between the\nPost Office and James Arbuthnot, then a Tory MP who was campaigning for\nwrongly convicted operators, the inquiry heard.\n\nJulian Blake, the counsel to the inquiry, put it to Crichton that there was\n\u201cdiscussion within the business at the highest levels\u201d about \u201cchanging the\nlanguage around these bugs\u201d so it was \u201cless emotive language\u201d. Crichton said\nshe did not recall a discussion around language.\n\n\u201cAre we to understand here that words suggested by Paula Vennells\u2019s husband\nhave now made their way into the terminology that\u2019s being used by the\nbusiness,\u201d Blake asked Crichton, adding it was an \u201cabsolutely Orwellian\u201d use\nof language.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what it looked like,\u201d she replied.\n\nCrichton was also asked why she had suggested that operators with criminal\nconvictions including Seema Misra should be excluded from Second Sight\u2019s\ninvestigation.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Business Today\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and\nanalysis you need every morning\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

She\nwas sentenced to 15 months in prison for theft and locked up on her son\u2019s 10th\nbirthday while eight weeks pregnant. She was placed on suicide watch after\ncollapsing in court. Her conviction was among those overturned by the court of\nappeal in 2021.\n\nCrichton replied: \u201cI was very concerned about the situation. I understood what\nhad happened was very concerning and I did not want to reopen it [the Misra\ncase] unless we had good reason to.\u201d\n\nShe told the inquiry: \u201cI agree it was too shortsighted maybe.\u201d\n\nCrichton also used her appearance before the inquiry to apologise to the post\noffice operators and say she was \u201ctruly sorry for the suffering\u201d caused to\nthem and their families by the scandal.\n\nThe inquiry continues.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Post Office Horizon scandal\n  * Post Office\n  * Corporate governance\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Post Office was urged by external lawyers to \u2018suppress\u2019 key document, inquiry hears\n\n5d ago\n\n  * ### Post Office boss \u2018obsessed with his pay\u2019, claims former HR director\n\n4h ago\n\n  * ### Former Royal Mail chair apologises for \u2018tragic\u2019 Post Office prosecutions\n\n6d ago\n\n  * ### Post Office chief Nick Read cleared of misconduct in separate inquiry\n\n6d ago\n\n  * ### Former Post Office executive says he should not have said Horizon was robust\n\n16 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Post office operators may prosecute to hold officials to account, says Alan Bates\n\n13 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Ex-Post Office boss wrote of \u2018subbies with hand in the till\u2019, inquiry hears\n\n12 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Post office operator wrongly jailed while pregnant rejects executive\u2019s apology\n\n11 Apr 2024\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * UK\n  * UK politics\n  * Education\n  * Media\n  * Society\n  * Law\n  * Scotland\n  * Wales\n  * Northern Ireland\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
