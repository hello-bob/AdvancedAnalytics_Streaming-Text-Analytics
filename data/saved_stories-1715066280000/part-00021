Its deployment, however, failed, and it\nbecame another piece of space junk. When looking over the satellite\u2019s archival\ndata, Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center\nfor Astrophysics, found that it had gone missing once before, with radars\ntracking it in the 1970s before it disappeared, and then again in the 1990s\nbefore it disappeared once more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe satellite was rediscovered earlier this week after being untracked for the\npast 25 years, according to tracking data from the Space Force\u2019s 18th Space\nDefense Squadron. \u201cThe problem is that it possibly has a very low radar cross\nsection,\u201d McDowell told Gizmodo over the phone. \u201cAnd maybe the thing that\nthey\u2019re tracking is a dispenser or a piece of the balloon that didn\u2019t deploy\nright, so it\u2019s not metal and doesn\u2019t show up well on radar.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGround-based radar and optical sensors are keeping track of more than 20,000\nobjects in orbit, and that can get quite tricky. There is a global network of\nsensors that feeds information to an up-to-date catalogue of satellites, but\nthe majority of objects don\u2019t transmit their identities. Instead, the sensors\ndepend on identifying the orbit of a moving object and matching it with the\ndesignated orbit of a satellite.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically like air traffic control,\u201d McDowell said. \u201cAll this stuff is\nwhizzing around and if you\u2019re going to try flying through that, you want to\nknow where the hazards are.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a satellite is launched, engineers on the ground know roughly where it\u2019s\ngoing to be and at what altitude it\u2019s going to be drifting. If an object is\nfound in that designated area, then they can rewind that orbit and see if it\nmeets with the orbit of when the satellite was last seen.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve got a recent orbital data set, and there\u2019s not too many things that\nare similar orbit, it\u2019s probably an easy match,\u201d McDowell said. \u201cBut if it\u2019s a\nvery crowded bit of parameter space, and you haven\u2019t seen it for a while, then\nit\u2019s not so easy to match up.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTracking satellites in geostationary orbit\u2014a circular orbit directly above the\nequator\u2014can be challenging because there are no radars positioned to monitor\nobjects precisely on the equator. \u201cThere\u2019s actually a hole in the tracking,\u201d\nMcDowell said. \u201cIf you hug the equator, you can hide from the tracking.\u201d\n\nIf a satellite also carries out an unexpected maneuver, then engineers are\nforced to hunt for it in Earth orbit. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know exactly where the\nmaneuver was, you may have trouble locating it,\u201d McDowell said. \u201cIf I rewind\nthe orbit of an object and fast forward for the missing object, do they meet\nand is the point where they meet where the maneuver happened?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost things that end up go missing in space are either defunct satellites or\nbroken up fragments of debris. The Department of Defense\u2019s global Space\nSurveillance Network is currently tracking more than 27,000 objects in orbit,\nthe majority of which are spent rocket boosters, and operational and dead\nsatellites.\n\nAs Earth orbit gets more crowded with a growing number of satellite\nconstellations and rocket launches, it\u2019s become more crucial to keep track of\nall these objects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re missing one or two objects, that\u2019s not a huge risk,\u201d McDowell said.\n\u201cBut you want to do as good a job as you can.\u201d\n\nFor more spaceflight in your life, follow us on X and bookmark Gizmodo\u2019s\ndedicated Spaceflight page.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
