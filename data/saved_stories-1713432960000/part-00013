Born in Boston, he did his undergraduate studies at MIT. He\nreceived his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1965, after studying there with\nOscar Zariski and David Mumford, and joined the MIT faculty in 1969.^[1]\nKleiman held a prestigious NATO Postdoctoral Fellowship (1966\u20131967), Sloan\nFellowship (1968), and Guggenheim Fellowship (1979).\n\n## Contributions[edit]\n\nKleiman is known for his work in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra.\nHe has made seminal contributions in motivic cohomology, moduli theory,\nintersection theory and enumerative geometry. A 2002 study of 891 academic\ncollaborations in enumerative geometry and intersection theory covered by\nMathematical Reviews found that he was not only the most prolific author in\nthose areas, but also the one with the most collaborative ties, and the most\ncentral author of the field in terms of closeness centrality; the study's\nauthors proposed to name the collaboration graph of the field in his\nhonor.^[2]\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\nIn 1989 the University of Copenhagen awarded him an honorary doctorate^[3] and\nin May 2002 the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters hosted a conference\nin honor of his 60th birthday and elected him as a foreign member.^[4] In 1992\nKleiman was elected foreign member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and\nLetters.\n\nIn 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.^[5] He was an\ninvited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematics at Nice in\n1970.^[6]\n\n## Selected publications[edit]\n\n  * Kleiman, Steven L.
