To overcome these intractable\nbehavioral deficits you must do X, Y and Z.\u201d\n\nX, Y and Z are variable and usually contradictory between one expert and the\nnext, but the patronizing stereotypes remain constant. I\u2019m not entirely sure\nthat is helpful. So, using the familiar brush, allow me to paint a different\npicture of those IT pros buried somewhere in your organization.\n\nMy career has been stippled with a good bit of disaster recovery consulting,\nwhich has led me to deal with dozens of organizations on their worst day, when\nopinions were pretty raw. I\u2019ve heard all of the above-mentioned stereotypes\nand far worse, as well as good bit of rage. The worse shape an organization is\nin, the more you hear the stereotypes thrown around. But my personal\nexperiences working within IT groups have always been quite good, working with\nIT pros for whom the negative stereotypes just don\u2019t seem to apply. I tended\nto chalk up IT group failures to some bad luck in hiring and the delicate\nbalance of those geek stereotypes.\n\nRecently, though, I have come to realize that perfectly healthy groups with\nsolid, well-adjusted IT pros can and will devolve, slowly and quietly, into\nthe behaviors that give rise to the stereotypes, given the right set of\nconditions. It turns out that it is the conditions that are stereotypical, and\nthe IT pros tend to react to those conditions in logical ways. To say it a\ndifferent way, organizations actively elicit these stereotypical negative\nbehaviors.\n\nUnderstanding why IT pros appear to act the way they do makes working with,\namong and as one of them the easiest job in the world.\n\n### It\u2019s all about respect\n\nFew people notice this, but for IT groups respect is the currency of the\nrealm. IT pros do not squander this currency. Those whom they do not believe\nare worthy of their respect might instead be treated to professional courtesy,\na friendly demeanor or the acceptance of authority. Gaining respect is not a\nmatter of being the boss and has nothing to do with being likeable or\nsociable; whether you talk, eat or smell right; or any measure that isn\u2019t\ndirectly related to the work. The amount of respect an IT pro pays someone is\na measure of how tolerable that person is when it comes to getting things\ndone, including the elegance and practicality of his solutions and\nsuggestions. IT pros always and without fail, quietly self-organize around\nthose who make the work easier, while shunning those who make the work harder,\nindependent of the organizational chart.\n\nThis self-ordering behavior occurs naturally in the IT world because it is\npopulated by people skilled in creative analysis and ordered reasoning.\nDoctors are a close parallel. The stakes may be higher in medicine, but the\nwork in both fields requires a technical expertise that can\u2019t be faked and a\nproficiency that can only be measured by qualified peers. I think every good\nIT pro on the planet idolizes Dr. House (minus the addictions).\n\nWhile everyone would like to work for a nice person who is always right, IT\npros will prefer a jerk who is always right over a nice person who is always\nwrong. Wrong creates unnecessary work, impossible situations and major\nfailures. Wrong is evil, and it must be defeated. Capacity for technical\nreasoning trumps all other professional factors, period.\n\nFoundational (bottom-up) respect is not only the largest single determining\nfactor in the success of an IT team, but the most ignored. I believe you can\npredict success or failure of an IT group simply by assessing the amount of\nmutual respect within it.\n\n### The elements of the stereotypes\n\nEgo \u2014 Similar to what good doctors do, IT pros figure out that the proper\nprojection of ego engenders trust and reduces apprehension. Because IT pros\u2019\neducation does not emphasize how to deal with people, there are always rough\nedges. Ego, as it plays out in IT, is an essential confidence combined with a\nnot-so-subtle cynicism. It\u2019s not about being right for the sake of being right\nbut being right for the sake of saving a lot of time, effort, money and\ncredibility. IT is a team sport, so being right or wrong impacts other members\nof the group in non-trivial ways. Unlike in many industries, in IT, colleagues\ncan significantly influence the careers of the entire team. Correctness yields\nrespect, respect builds good teams, and good teams build trust and maintain\ncredibility through a healthy projection of ego. Strong IT groups view\ncorrectness as a virtue, and certitude as a delivery method. Meek IT groups,\nbeaten down by inconsistent policies and a lack of structural support, are\nsimply ineffective at driving change and creating efficiencies, getting mowed\nover by the clients, the management or both at every turn.\n\nThe victim mentality \u2014 IT pros are sensitive to logic \u2014 that\u2019s what you pay\nthem for. When things don\u2019t add up, they are prone to express their opinions\non the matter, and the level of response will be proportional to the absurdity\nof the event. The more things that occur that make no sense, the more cynical\nIT pros will become. Standard organizational politics often run afoul of this,\nso IT pros can come to be seen as whiny or as having a victim mentality.\nPresuming this is a trait that must be disciplined out of them is a huge\nmanagement mistake. IT pros complain primarily about logic, and primarily to\npeople they respect. If you are dismissive of complaints, fail to recognize an\nillogical event or behave in deceptive ways, IT pros will likely stop\ncomplaining to you. You might mistake this as a behavioral improvement, when\nit\u2019s actually a show of disrespect. It means you are no longer worth talking\nto, which leads to insubordination.\n\nInsubordination \u2014 This is a tricky one. Good IT pros are not anti-bureaucracy,\nas many observers think. They are anti-stupidity. The difference is both\nsubjective and subtle. Good IT pros, whether they are expected to or not, have\nto operate and make decisions with little supervision. So when the rules are\nloose and logical and supervision is results-oriented, supportive and helpful\nto the process, IT pros are loyal, open, engaged and downright sociable.\nArbitrary or micro-management, illogical decisions, inconsistent policies, the\ncreation of unnecessary work and exclusionary practices will elicit a quiet,\nsubversive, almost vicious attitude from otherwise excellent IT staff.\nInterestingly, IT groups don\u2019t fall apart in this mode. From the outside,\nnothing looks to be wrong and the work still gets done. But internally, the IT\ngroup, or portions of it, may cut themselves off almost entirely from the\nintended management structure. They may work on big projects or steer the\ngroup entirely from the shadows while diverting the attention of supervisors\nto lesser topics. They believe they are protecting the organization, as well\nas their own credibility \u2014 and they are often correct.\n\nCredit whoring \u2014 IT pros would prefer to make a good decision than to get\ncredit for it. What will make them seek credit is the danger that a member of\nthe group or management who is dangerous to the process might receive the\ncredit for the work instead. That is insulting. If you\u2019ve got a lot of credit\nwhores in your IT group, there are bigger problems causing it.\n\nAntisocial behavior \u2014 It\u2019s fair to say that there is a large contingent of IT\npros who are socially unskilled. However, this doesn\u2019t mean those IT pros are\nantisocial. On the whole, they have plenty to say. If you want to get your IT\npros more involved, you should deal with the problems laid out above and then\ntrain your other staff how to deal with IT. Users need to be reminded a few\nthings, including:\n\n  * IT wants to help me.\n  * I should keep an open mind.\n  * IT is not my personal tech adviser, nor is my work computer my personal computer.\n  * IT people have lives and other interests.\n\nLike anyone else, IT people tend to socialize with people who respect them.\nThey\u2019ll stop going to the company picnic if it becomes an occasion for\neveryone to list all the computer problems they never bothered to mention\nbefore.\n\n### How we elicit the stereotypes\n\nWhat executives often fail to recognize is that every decision made that\nimpacts IT is a technical decision. Not just some of the decisions, and not\njust the details of the decision, but every decision, bar none.\n\nWith IT, you cannot separate the technical aspects from the business aspects.\nThey are one and the same, each constrained by the other and both constrained\nby creativity. Creativity is the most valuable asset of an IT group, and\nfailing to promote it can cost an organization literally millions of dollars.\n\nMost IT pros support an organization that is not involved with IT. The primary\ntask of any IT group is to teach people how to work. That\u2019s may sound\nauthoritarian, but it\u2019s not. IT\u2019s job at the most fundamental level is to\nbuild, maintain and improve frameworks within which to accomplish tasks. You\nmay not view a Web server as a framework to accomplish tasks, but it does\nautomate the processes of advertising, sales, informing and entertaining, all\nof which would otherwise be done in other ways. IT groups literally teach and\nreteach the world how to work. That\u2019s the job.\n\nWhen you understand the mission of IT, it isn\u2019t hard to see why co-workers and\nsupervisors are judged severely according to their abilities to contribute to\nthat process. If someone has to constantly be taught Computers 101 every time\na new problem presents itself, he can\u2019t contribute in the most fundamental\nway. It is one thing to deal with that from a co-worker, but quite another if\nthe people who represent IT to the organization at large aren\u2019t cognizant of\nhow the technology works, can\u2019t communicate it in the manner the IT group\nneeds it communicated, can\u2019t maintain consistency, take credit for the work of\nthe group members, etc. This creates a huge morale problem for the group.\nExecutives expect expert advice from the top IT person, but they have no way\nof knowing when they aren\u2019t getting it. Therein lies the problem.\n\nIT pros know when this is happening, and they find that it is impossible to\ndraw attention to it. Once their work is impeded by the problem, they will\nadopt strategies and behaviors that help circumvent the issue. That is not a\nsustainable state, but how long it takes to deteriorate can be days, months or\neven years.\n\n### How to fix it\n\nSo, if you want to have a really happy, healthy and valuable IT group, I\nrecommend one thing: Take an interest. IT pros work their butts off for people\nthey respect, so you need to give them every reason to afford you some.\n\nYou can start with the hiring process. When hiring an IT pro, imagine you\u2019re\nrecruiting a doctor. And if you\u2019re hiring a CIO, think of employing a chief of\nmedicine. The chief of medicine should have many qualifications, but first and\nforemost, he should be a practicing doctor. Who decides if a doctor is a\ndoctor? Other doctors! So, if your IT group isn\u2019t at the table for the hiring\nprocess of their bosses and peers, this already does a disservice to the\nprocess.\n\nFavor technical competence and leadership skills. Standard managerial\nprocesses are nearly useless in an IT group. As I mentioned, if you\u2019ve managed\nto hire well in the lower ranks of your IT group, the staff already know how\nto manage things. Unlike in many industries, the fight in most IT groups is in\nhow to get things done, not how to avoid work. IT pros will self-organize,\ndisrupt and subvert in the name of accomplishing work. An over-structured,\nmicro-managing, technically deficient runt, no matter how polished, who\u2019s\nthrown into the mix for the sake of management will get a response from the\nprofessional IT group that\u2019s similar to anyone\u2019s response to a five-year-old\ntugging his pants leg.\n\nWhat IT pros want in a manager is a technical sounding board and a source of\ngeneral direction. Leadership and technical competence are qualities to look\nfor in every member of the team. If you need someone to keep track of where\nprojects are, file paperwork, produce reports and do customer relations, hire\nsome assistants for a lot less money.\n\nWhen it comes to performance checks, yearly reviews are worthless without a\n360-degree assessment. Those things take more time than a simple top-down\nreview, but it is time well spent. If you\u2019ve been paying attention to what\nI\u2019ve been telling you about how IT groups behave and organize, then you will\nsee your IT group in a whole different light when you read the group\u2019s 360s.\n\nAnd make sure all your managers are practicing and learning. It is very easy\nto slip behind the curve in those positions, but just as with doctors, the\nonly way to be relevant is to practice and maintain an expertise. In IT, six\nmonths to a year is all that stands between respect and irrelevance.\n\nFinally, executives should have multiple in-points to the IT team. If the IT\nteam is singing out of tune, it is worth investigating the reasons. But you\u2019ll\nnever even know if that\u2019s the case if the only information you receive is from\nthe CIO. Periodically, bring a few key IT brains to the boardroom to observe\nthe problems of the organization at large, even about things outside of the IT\nworld, if only to make use of their exquisitely refined BS detectors. A good\nIT pro is trained in how to accomplish work; their skills are not necessarily\nlimited to computing. In fact, the best business decision-makers I know are IT\npeople who aren\u2019t even managers.\n\nAs I said at the very beginning, it\u2019s all about respect. If you can identify\nand cultivate those individuals and processes that earn genuine respect from\nIT pros, you\u2019ll have a great IT team. Taking an honest interest in helping\nyour IT group help you is probably the smartest business move an organization\ncan make. It also makes for happy, completely non-geek-like geeks.\n\nJeff Ello is a hybrid veteran of the IT and CG industries, currently managing\nIT for the Krannert School of Management at Purdue University.
