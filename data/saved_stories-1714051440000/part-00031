Jackson as 1950s entrepreneurs who had\nto become con artists to be players in the banking business.\n\nApple\n\n\u201cThe Banker\u201d is one of the rare movies centered on a bank that isn\u2019t about\nrobbing it. That doesn\u2019t mean the film is short on scams or deceptions. Based\non historic events that took place in the 1950s and \u201960s, \u201cThe Banker\u201d tells\nthe true story of Bernard Garrett (Anthony Mackie) and Joe Morris (Samuel L.\nJackson), a wily pair of African-American entrepreneurs who made themselves\npart of the real-estate game in Los Angeles, with the goal of getting rich\n(which they did) and, at the same time, of breaking the color line, making it\npossible for black citizens to move into formerly all-white neighborhoods.\n\nKnowing that the real-estate business is the right arm of the banking\nbusiness, the two sought to maneuver their way into the latter. Yet due to the\ncolor of their skin, they could barely get through the door. So they recruited\na white man, a home-repair worker named Matt Steiner (Nicholas Hoult), to act\nas a front for them. They trained him to walk like a banker, talk like a\nbanker, and think like a banker. That\u2019s when the plot thickened.\n\n## Related Stories\n\nVIP+\n\n### \u2018Civil War\u2019 Record Opening Leaves A24 With More to Prove\n\n### \u2018YOLO\u2019 Review: A Megahit Chinese Boxing Movie That Needs More Punch\n\nThis past December, \u201cThe Banker\u201d was set to be the first theatrical feature\nreleased by Apple TV Plus, and it\u2019s easy to see why a company as powerful as\nApple would want to present a movie like this one as its \u201cLook out, Netflix,\nhere we come!\u201d awards-bait launch statement. (The release date got bumped\nafter Garrett\u2019s son, Bernard Garrett Jr., who was one of the movie\u2019s\nproducers, was accused of sexual abuse by his half-sister, Cynthia Garrett.\nHis name has since been removed from the film.)\n\n### Popular on Variety\n\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\n\u201cThe Banker,\u201d if you look at it through one lens, is a Civil Rights drama, and\na highly original one, since it focuses on men who have the audacity to dream\nbig \u2014 not just about political freedom and racial equality, but about making\nmoney \u2014 at a time of squelched opportunity. It\u2019s a dead-serious story, but it\nhas a sneaky caper side, since Garrett and Morris, in order to make themselves\ntwo of the first African-American bankers, have no choice but to act as con\nartists. Once they start using Steiner as a front, the two dress up, as a\nchauffeur and a janitor, to go into the banks and spy on board meetings. Talk\nabout a disguise that\u2019s also a social metaphor.\n\nBeyond that, the film has a superb cast, with each actor biting into his role\nin a different showpiece style. Mackie plays Garrett as a deadpan shark in\nimpeccable silver suits \u2014 a numbers wizard with a mind that won\u2019t quit, though\nhis aggression remains concealed behind a pair of horn-rims. Jackson\u2019s Morris,\nwho we first encounter as the lusty, tippling owner of an L.A. jazz club, is\nhis own kind of deceptive hustler; he owns buildings all over the city, and\nbases every move on a ruefully vivacious perception of how little he\ntrusts...anyone. The white man? Not at all. The black man? A little bit, but\nnever too much. Jackson\u2019s performance is so jaunty that it takes a while to\nsee how much hard-won cynical wisdom he packs in there.\n\n\u201cThe Banker\u201d aims high. It doesn\u2019t dumb down the banking jargon or try to\ntrick up the front-man stuff into some sort of facile racial suspense\nthriller. It\u2019s a movie about finance: how it operates, how to succeed. It\u2019s a\nmovie, to a large degree, about things that happen on paper, and \u201cThe Banker,\u201d\nat least on paper, must have looked like a winner and a knockout. But as\ndirected by George Nolfi (who co-wrote the script with three other writers),\nthere\u2019s something staid and contained about it. Visually, it\u2019s got a\npicturesque but antiseptic made-for-streaming quality, and as drama it\u2019s like\na deep-dive magazine article in movie form. You may wish that you were reading\nabout these events in The New Yorker, because the movie is so choked with\nneutral detail that it\u2019s a little bloodless. It lacks fire.\n\nGarrett, who overhears and absorbs business arcana like a sponge when he\u2019s\nshining shoes as a kid in Willis, Texas, arrives in L.A. with his wife, Eunice\n(Nia Long), and young son, Bernard Jr. (Jaylon Gordon), ready to take over the\ntown. He grasps how bringing an end to segregation will be both a moral act\nand a financial windfall, tapping the resources of a new black middle class.\nFor a while, the sternly disciplined Garrett and the high-rolling Morris do a\nskeptical dance around each other, but they start buying buildings and become\nwell-oiled partners. It\u2019s Garrett who comes up with their most outlandish\nplan: to purchase The Bankers Building, a 14-story architectural jewel that\nwas, at the time, the largest commercial building in downtown L.A. If they can\nown it, they\u2019ll be able to pressure any bank in the building to give them\nloans.\n\nMatt Steiner, who they recruit to be their stand-in, starts off as an affable\nworking-class dolt; their main challenge is teaching him how to play golf. But\nhe has to learn to talk numbers, too, and it\u2019s here that the movie starts to\nseem like it\u2019s bending its own rules. Matt, who once tried to start his own\nbusiness (a drive-in ice-cream stand), is an ace at memorizing, but he still\nhas no idea what the numbers mean. But then he starts improvising in tricky\nsituations; so he does know? And then, suddenly, he\u2019s an ambitious banker,\nprodded by his gold-digger wife (Taylor Black), and he\u2019s demanding his own\nshare of the action. The inconsistency of his faux businessman\u2019s journey is\nactually less bothersome than the way that Holt\u2019s slightly goofy white\ncharacter starts to exert so much pull on the narrative.\n\nThe second half of \u201cThe Banker\u201d is all about how Garrett, in 1963, leads his\npartners to buy the Mainland Bank back in Willis (with Steiner, once again, as\nthe front), so that he can give loans to black businesses there and build an\nAfrican-American middle class in his old Texas town. This becomes the film\u2019s\npolitical statement: that without the support of banks, black Americans were\ncut off from the possibilities of wealth-building. No right-minded person\nwould disagree, yet as astute as the point may be, for a dramatic feature it\u2019s\nan awfully wonkish message. And the way that Garrett\u2019s scheme comes apart\nseems not so much wrenching as, simply, inevitable. \u201cThe Banker\u201d fills in a\nslice of history you probably didn\u2019t know. But it\u2019s history written with\nvacuum-packed lightning.\n\nJump to Comments\n\n## \u2018The Banker\u2019: Film Review\n\n## Reviewed at Dolby 88, New York, March 3, 2020. MPAA Rating: PG-13.
