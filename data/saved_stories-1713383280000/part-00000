Enshittification\n\nML Shaw\n\nApr 17, 2024\n\nShare this post\n\n#### #youtubepick The Enshittification of Internet is Here - Why and How?\n\nwww.apeit.ink\n\nShare\n\n\\- Big tech companies follow a pattern called \"Enshittification\" where they\nstart by offering surplus benefits to users to become essential, then shift\nfocus to suppliers to build a monopoly, and finally, extract maximum surplus\nfor themselves.\n\n\\- This surplus extraction leads to tiering of services, where higher tiers\noffer better experiences at higher prices while lower tiers provide minimum\nacceptable service, making the experience worse for non-premium users.\n\n\\- Subscriptions are used by big tech to increase revenue by charging both\nupfront and monthly fees, often resulting in users paying more for a worse\nservice compared to the initial free or cheaper versions.\n\n\\- Companies like Uber and Amazon use platform fees and dark patterns like\ndefault options manipulation and confusing cancellation processes to extract\nmaximum value from consumers, often at unfair prices.\n\n\\- Dark patterns include deliberately confusing website designs, guilt-\ntripping tactics, and making it challenging to cancel subscriptions, leading\nto consumer exploitation and overpayment.\n\n\\- The proliferation of subscription services across various platforms results\nin users paying more for content they used to access at lower costs, leading\nto increased expenses for consumers.\n\n\\- The video highlights examples of predatory pricing, misleading subscription\nmodels, and the negative impact of tiering and surplus extraction on consumer\nexperiences and costs.\n\n\\- Overall, the main takeaway is the need for consumers to be aware of these\ntactics and advocate for fairer pricing and transparency from big tech\ncompanies.\n\n\\- \ud83d\udcfa Subscription services have become ubiquitous, leading to a significant\nfinancial burden on consumers who subscribe to multiple platforms for work and\npersonal use.\n\n\\- \ud83d\udcb0 Subscriptions offer businesses predictable revenue and create lock-in\neffects where subscribers are likely to continue paying for additional\nfeatures or higher tiers.\n\n\\- \ud83d\udd04 Consumers can mitigate subscription costs by canceling subscriptions they\nonly need for a short period or by rotating subscriptions to different\nservices.\n\n\\- \ud83d\udcda Governments should enforce policies that facilitate smooth switching\nbetween platforms and ensure platforms deliver on their initial promises to\nconsumers.\n\n\\- \ud83c\udf10 Fragmentation of attention and services due to companies getting too big\ncan worsen the consumer experience, especially in the subscription era.\n\n\\- \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Consumers should be mindful of the subscriptions they commit to and\nadvocate for fairer pricing, transparency, and quality improvements from\nsubscription-based companies.\n\n\\- \ud83d\udca1 The key takeaway is the importance of consumer awareness, government\npolicies, and companies delivering on their promises to enhance the\nsubscription experience for users.\n\nsource:\n\n### Subscribe to ApeIt.Ink\n\nBy ML Shaw \u00b7 Launched a month ago\n\n\"ApeIt.ink: Your Go-To Hub for Dynamic News, Insightful Opinions, and Engaging\nBlogs.
