It feels unfair to suggest we are missing out when he left behind so\nmuch. His ideas will live far into the future, and they are freely available\nto those who seek them. In fact, YouTube is a veritable Munger gold mine, and\nI highly recommend his book, Poor Charlie\u2019s Almanack.\n\nThe book includes Munger\u2019s famous 1986 Harvard School Commencement Speech.\nInstead of sharing a recipe for success in life during his speech, Munger\ninstead provided graduates with advice for leading a life of misery. That\nadvice included being unreliable, learning mostly from yourself, lacking\nresilience, and giving no thought as to what to avoid in life.\n\nIn a nod to Charlie Munger and that speech, here\u2019s my prescription for\nfinancial misery\u2014or, what not to do when investing:\n\nBe impatient. Aim to get rich fast! Almost anyone can get rich slowly with\nhard work, disciplined investment, a balanced risk appetite, and the power of\ncompounding. Einstein called the compounding \u201cthe eighth wonder of the world.\u201d\nBut in the words of Veruca Salt from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, \u201cI\nwant it now.\u201d Let that be your catch cry. Eschew patience for shortcuts, make\nconcentrated bets, and lever up your investment. This will greatly raise your\nchances of future financial ruin, even if it works well for a while.\n\nBuild a \u201chouse of straw\u201d portfolio. Quality, schmality! Relieve yourself of\nthe need for prudence and underlying portfolio strength. Assume that, thanks\nto the magic of modern economic management, the days of major disruptions are\nin the past. And if something bad happens, assume the world\u2019s central banks\nand governments will come to your rescue. In wishing the big bad wolf away,\nsuch optimism facilitates the construction of a \u201chouse of straw\u201d portfolio to\nmaximize your chance of wealth destruction in a bear market.\n\n## More From Charlie Munger (& Warren Buffett, Too)\n\n### Berkshire Hathaway's 2023 Shareholder Letter: Key Takeaways\n\nWarren Buffett on Charlie Munger, realistic investment expectations, and the\nstocks he won\u2019t sell.\n\n### 12 Lessons on Money and More From Buffett and Munger\n\nWords of wisdom from two of the world\u2019s most successful investors.\n\n### Final Thoughts From Munger on Apple, Buffett, and the Big Costco Error\n\nBuffett\u2019s partner at Berkshire Hathaway has died. Here are some excerpts from\none of his final interviews.\n\nInvest anywhere. No knowledge, no worries! Why stick to the quaint notion of a\ncircle of competence when there\u2019s a world of investment options at your\nfingertips? And don\u2019t be dissuaded by complexity. Just because you don\u2019t\nunderstand an investment doesn\u2019t mean you should avoid it if ruin is your\ngoal. \u201cStick to what you know\u201d is an unnecessary limitation. Think of all\nyou\u2019d be missing out on.\n\nKeep your own counsel. According to Mark Twain, \u201cThe man who doesn\u2019t read good\nbooks has no advantage over the man who can\u2019t read them.\u201d Why learn from the\nmistakes of others when there\u2019s plenty you can learn at your own expense? By\nformulating all of your investment ideas only from what\u2019s in your head, you\u2019ll\nbe free of the need to learn from others and also free of the benefit that\nbrings.\n\nDon\u2019t change your mind. Quoting John Maynard Keynes, \u201cWhen the facts change, I\nchange my mind. What do you do sir?\u201d Thanks to modern technology, you can now\nbuild your own echo chamber and avoid any inconvenient facts. Read only the\nnews you want: Social media can quickly help you to curate this with zero\neffort. You can also find groups of like-minded individuals to reinforce and\ncalcify your existing views. These two moves take away the burdensome task of\nprocessing new ideas and information and also allow you to fully indulge your\nown cognitive biases. All you need to do now is wait for reality to nastily\ncollide with your portfolio.\n\n## 5 Key Lessons to Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger\u2019s Success\n\nThe legendary investors credited their ability to avoid making dumb decisions\nrather than making brilliant ones for their performance.\n\n2m 34s Mar 7, 2024\n\nFollow the crowd. Market up? Be happy. Market down? You be, too. Listen to\nyour taxi or Uber driver. Whether they\u2019re optimistic or pessimistic, do the\nsame. So too with backyard barbecue guests. Why let Mr. Market serve you when\nyou can serve him? By closely watching price and volume trading information,\nyou can have your finger on the pulse of the market and be ready to go with\nthe crowd. This helps to sell low and buy high and goes a long way to\ncountering the magical power of compound returns.\n\nTrade often. Turn up the noise. Get engaged. Become a screen jockey. Allow\ncolorful screens, flashing lights, and frequent noisy alerts to command your\nattention. Harness what Nobel Prize-winning economist Daniel Kahneman called\n\u201csystem one thinking,\u201d the fast but often wrong ideas that quickly pop into\nour heads. Make snap judgments and act to give yourself the best chance of\nmaking costly mistakes. Online traders act fast and mostly lose. You can, too.\n\nTime the market. You can thwart the power of compounding and turn the market\ninto a casino simply by timing it. Move in and out of stocks\u2014and the market as\na whole\u2014often. As Buffett has said, \u201cif they think they can dance in and out\n[of the market] and buy and sell stocks, they ought to head for Las Vegas.\u201d\nAnd as we know, Vegas is fun.\n\nAvoid losses. Hold your losers when counter evidence is strong, and even if\nyour investment thesis is broken. No one likes to admit defeat, and to realize\na loss is an admission of being wrong. And once sold, any distant hope of a\nrecovery goes, and so too the opportunity to double down. Avoid the\ninconvenience and save face by changing your thesis as required to hold your\nlosers. And all you give up is the opportunity cost of future returns.\n\nSell your winners no matter what. So, you\u2019ve found a diamond. A business\ninvestment that can compound at high rates for a long time. And you\u2019re up on\nthat investment. Your original thesis has \u201cplayed out,\u201d and the return you\nexpected in three years has come much sooner. It\u2019s time to sell, chalk it up\nas a win, and move on. You can always buy it back another time.\n\nReturning to seriousness, investors should actually seek businesses with the\nability to compound for decades and never sell. Finding these gems is the Holy\nGrail. Munger was a champion of this approach and persuaded Buffett of its\nbenefits. He famously told Buffett in 1965, \u201cNow that you have control of\nBerkshire, add to it wonderful businesses purchased at fair prices and give up\nbuying fair businesses at wonderful prices.\u201d Such an approach requires\npatience, discipline, and above all, inaction.\n\n## How to Invest Like Warren Buffett & Charlie Munger\n\n### Warren Buffett's Approach to Investing\n\nThe strategy relies on thinking like an owner, focusing on quality, and\ndemanding a margin of safety.\n\n### What We\u2019ve Learned From Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger\n\nHow these legendary investors have inspired the financial world and shaped the\nway we think at Morningstar.\n\n### The DNA of a Warren Buffett Company\n\nCompanies that make it into Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s portfolio have some common\nthreads in their genetic code.\n\nTurn our stock insights into action with a subscription to Morningstar\nInvestor.
