But the ugly truth is that the\nEarth is doomed. Someday, the Sun will enter a stage that will make life\nimpossible on the Earth\u2019s surface and eventually reduce the planet to nothing\nmore than a sad, lonely chunk of iron and nickel.\n\nThe good news is that if we really put our minds to it\u2014and don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll\nhave hundreds of millions of years to plan\u2014we can keep our home world\nhospitable, even long after our Sun goes haywire.\n\n## A waking nightmare\n\nThe Sun is slowly but inexorably getting brighter, hotter, and larger with\ntime. Billions of years ago, when collections of molecules first began to\ndance together and call themselves alive, the Sun was roughly 20 percent\ndimmer than it is today. Even the dinosaurs knew a weaker, smaller star. And\nwhile the Sun is only halfway through the main hydrogen-burning phase of its\nlife, with 4-billion-and-change years before it begins its death throes, the\npeculiar combination of temperature and brightness that make life possible on\nthis little world of ours will erode in only a few hundred million years. A\nblink of an eye, astronomically speaking.\n\nThe Sun sows the seeds of its own demise through the basic physics of its\nexistence. At this very moment, our star is chewing through something like 600\nmillion metric tons of hydrogen every single second, slamming those atoms\ntogether in a nuclear inferno that reaches a temperature of over 27 million\ndegrees Fahrenheit. Of that 600 million metric tons, 4 million are converted\ninto energy\u2014 enough to illuminate the entire Solar System.\n\nThat fusion reaction is not perfectly clean, however. There is a leftover\nbyproduct, an ash created by the nuclear fires: helium. That helium has\nnowhere to go, as the deep convection cycles that constantly churn material\nwithin the Sun don\u2019t reach into the core where the helium is formed. So the\nhelium sits there, inert, lifeless, useless\u2014clogging up the machine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt its present age, the Sun does not have high enough temperatures and\npressures at its core to fuse helium. So, the helium gets in the way,\nincreasing the overall mass of the core without giving it anything else to\nfuse. Thankfully, the Sun is easily able to compensate for this, and that\ncompensation comes about through a bit of physics known as hydrostatic\nequilibrium.\n\nThe Sun exists in constant balance, living on the edge of a nuclear knife. On\none side are the energies released by the fusion process, which, if left\nuncontrolled, could threaten to explode\u2014or at the very least, expand\u2014the Sun.\nCountering that is the immense gravitational weight of the star itself,\npressing inward with all the might that 1,027 tons of hydrogen and helium can\nmuster. If that force were to go unchecked, the Sun\u2019s own gravity would crush\nour star into a black hole no bigger than a mid-sized city.\n\nSo what happens when an unstoppable force meets an irresistible pressure?\nGraceful balance\u2014and a star that can live for billions of years. If, for some\nreason, the nuclear inferno randomly ratchets up in temperature, that will\nheat up the rest of the star and inflate its outer layers, easing the\ngravitational pressure and slowing down the nuclear reactions. And if the Sun\nwere to randomly contract, more material would force itself into the core,\nwhere it would participate in the heady nuclear dance, and the release of\nenergy that results would conspire to reinflate the star to normal\nproportions.\n\nBut the presence of helium ash, that nuclear trash, upsets that balance by\ndisplacing hydrogen that would otherwise fuse. The Sun can\u2019t help but pull\ninward on itself\u2014gravity is uncompromising and uncaring. And when it does, it\nforces the nuclear reactions of the core to increase in ferocity, raising its\ntemperature, which in turn forces the surface of the Sun to swell and\nbrighten.\n\nSlowly, slowly, slowly, as helium continues to build up in the core of the Sun\n(or any other star of similar mass), it expands and brightens in response.\nIt\u2019s difficult to predict exactly when this brightening will result in\ncalamity for our planet\u2014that depends on a complex interplay of radiation,\natmosphere, and ocean. But the general estimate is that we have roughly 500\nmillion years left before life will become all but impossible.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Scientists Respond to Science Deniers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n223\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Channel Ars Technica\n\n#### Biomarkers, from diagnosis to treatment\n\nTo find cancer before it strikes, look for the molecular clues\n\n  * ##### Biomarkers, from diagnosis to treatment\n\n  * ##### Scott Manley Reacts To His Top 1000 YouTube Comments\n\n  * ##### Teach the Controversy: Dowsing\n\n  * ##### Teach the Conspiracy: GMOs\n\n  * ##### How Does That Work?: Rising sea levels\n\n  * ##### Teach the Controversy: Flat Earthers\n\n  * ##### How Does That Work?: Radiometric Dating\n\n  * ##### How Does That Work?: The Large Hadron Collider\n\n  * ##### What \"First Man\" tells you about Neil Armstrong, and what it doesn't\n\n  * ##### Delta V: The Burgeoning World of Small Rockets, Paul Allen's Huge Plane, and SpaceX Gets a Crucial Green-light\n\n  * ##### Inside the International Space Station with Scott Kelly\n\n  * ##### Chris Hadfield explains his 'Space Oddity' video\n\n  * ##### Astronaut Scott Kelly teaches orbital mechanics with Kerbal Space Program\n\n  * ##### Go Inside the Aerodrome, Where the Future of Flight Takes Shape\n\n  * ##### The soft future of robotics\n\n  * ##### See the Gear the CDC's Disease Detectives Use in the Field\n\n  * ##### Ars Technica interviews Peggy Whitson\n\n  * ##### The Ice Age Secrets of White Sands National Monument\n\n  * ##### InSight Landing On Mars\n\n  * ##### Talking Space and Robots with NASA's Terry Fong\n\nMore videos\n\n\u2190 Previous story Next story \u2192\n\n### Related Stories\n\n### Today on Ars\n\nCNMN Collection WIRED Media Group \u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
