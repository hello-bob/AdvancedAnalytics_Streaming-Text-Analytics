Credit: CERN\n\nThe late physicist Joseph Polchinski once said the existence of magnetic\nmonopoles is \"one of the safest bets that one can make about physics not yet\nseen.\" In its quest for these particles, which have a magnetic charge and are\npredicted by several theories that extend the Standard Model, the MoEDAL\ncollaboration at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has not yet proven Polchinski\nright, but its latest findings mark a significant stride forward.\n\nThe results, reported in two papers posted on the arXiv preprint server,\nconsiderably narrow the search window for these hypothetical particles.\n\nAt the LHC, pairs of magnetic monopoles could be produced in interactions\nbetween protons or heavy ions. In collisions between protons, they could be\nformed from a single virtual photon (the Drell\u2013Yan mechanism) or the fusion of\ntwo virtual photons (the photon-fusion mechanism). Pairs of magnetic monopoles\ncould also be produced from the vacuum in the enormous magnetic fields created\nin near-miss heavy-ion collisions, through a process called the Schwinger\nmechanism.\n\nSince it started taking data in 2012, MoEDAL has achieved several firsts,\nincluding conducting the first searches at the LHC for magnetic monopoles\nproduced via the photon-fusion mechanism and through the Schwinger mechanism.\n\nIn the first of its latest studies, the MoEDAL collaboration sought monopoles\nand high-electric-charge objects (HECOs) produced via the Drell\u2013Yan and\nphoton-fusion mechanisms. The search was based on proton\u2013proton collision data\ncollected during Run 2 of the LHC, using the full MoEDAL detector for the\nfirst time.\n\nThe full detector comprises two main systems sensitive to magnetic monopoles,\nHECOs and other highly ionizing hypothetical particles. The first can\npermanently register the tracks of magnetic monopoles and HECOs, with no\nbackground signals from Standard Model particles. These tracks are measured\nusing optical scanning microscopes at INFN Bologna.\n\nThe second system consists of roughly a ton of trapping volumes designed to\ncapture magnetic monopoles. These trapping volumes\u2014which make MoEDAL the only\ncollider experiment in the world that can definitively and directly identify\nthe magnetic charge of magnetic monopoles\u2014are scanned at ETH Zurich using a\nspecial type of magnetometer called a SQUID to look for any trapped monopoles\nthey may contain.\n\nIn their latest scanning of the trapping volumes, the MoEDAL team found no\nmagnetic monopoles or HECOs, but it set bounds on the mass and production rate\nof these particles for different values of particle spin, an intrinsic form of\nangular momentum.\n\nFor magnetic monopoles, the mass bounds were set for magnetic charges from 1\nto 10 times the fundamental unit of magnetic charge, the Dirac charge (gD),\nand the existence of monopoles with masses as high as about 3.9 trillion\nelectronvolts (TeV) was excluded.\n\nFor HECOs, the mass limits were established for electric charges from 5e to\n350e, where e is the electron charge, and the existence of HECOs with masses\nranging up to 3.4 TeV was ruled out.\n\n\"MoEDAL's search reach for both monopoles and HECOs allows the collaboration\nto survey a huge swathe of the theoretical 'discovery space' for these\nhypothetical particles,\" says MoEDAL spokesperson James Pinfold.\n\nIn its second latest study, the MoEDAL team concentrated on the search for\nmonopoles produced via the Schwinger mechanism in heavy-ion collision data\ntaken during Run 1 of the LHC. In a unique endeavor, it scanned a\ndecommissioned section of the CMS experiment beam pipe, instead of the MoEDAL\ndetector's trapping volumes, in search of trapped monopoles.\n\nOnce again, the team found no monopoles, but it set the strongest-to-date mass\nlimits on Schwinger monopoles with a charge between 2gD and 45gD, ruling out\nthe existence of monopoles with masses of up to 80 GeV.\n\n\"The vital importance of the Schwinger mechanism is that the production of\ncomposite monopoles is not suppressed compared to that of elementary ones, as\nis the case with the Drell\u2013Yan and photon-fusion processes,\" explains Pinfold.\n\"Thus, if monopoles are composite particles, this and our previous Schwinger-\nmonopole search may have been the first-ever chances to observe them.\"\n\nThe MoEDAL detector will soon be joined by the MoEDAL Apparatus for\nPenetrating Particles, MAPP for short, which will allow the experiment to cast\nan even broader net in the search for new particles.\n\nMore information: Search for Highly-Ionizing Particles in pp Collisions During\nLHC Run-2 Using the Full MoEDAL Detector, arXiv (2023).
