G. Young wrote in Armies in Retreat:\nChaos, Cohesion and Consequences.\n\nHow the Russians broke the Ukrainian line west of Avdiivka last weekend is the\nsubject of heated debate in Kyiv and across the 600-mile front line of\nRussia\u2019s 26-month wider war on Ukraine.\n\nSome observers have blamed the Ukrainian army\u2019s 115th Mechanized Brigade,\nwhich recently rotated into positions in Ocheretyne\u2014and was immediately\noverwhelmed by the Russian army\u2019s 30th Motor Rifle Brigade.\n\nOthers have pointed out that the 115th Mechanized Brigade is under-equipped\nand, like all Ukrainian units, starving for ammunition as it awaits fresh\nsupplies from the United States\u2014supplies that were delayed for six months by\nRussia-friendly Republicans in the U.S. Congress.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that all Ukrainian brigades struggle to hold defensive\npositions under relentless bombardment. \u201cThe aggressor has an advantage in the\nair and artillery, delivering almost continuous strikes on the Tavriya OSG\npositions,\u201d the Ukrainian Center for Defense Strategies reported.\n\nThe firepower imbalance might prove decisive as the battle rages on. Sensing\nan opportunity and apparently feeling confident in their chances, Russian\ncommanders have shoved the 15th and 74th Motor Rifle Brigades into the salient\nalong with elements of the 90th Tank Division and some special forces.\n\nAt least seven Ukrainian brigades and a separate battalion are fighting back:\nthe 23rd, 25th, 47th, 100th and 115th Mechanized Brigades, the 25th Air\nAssault Brigade, the 3rd Assault Brigade and the 425th Assault Battalion. The\nbrigades typically deploy just one battalion at a time.\n\nIt\u2019s apparent the Russians have, in all, more than 10,000 troops in or near\nthe salient. Just 3,000 or so Ukrainians oppose them, if the Center for\nDefense Strategies\u2019 estimate is accurate.\n\nDefending is easier than attacking even when the attacker has a firepower\nadvantage, so the Russians aren\u2019t guaranteed to win the battle and compel the\nUkrainians to withdraw.\n\nThe Center for Defense Strategies highlighted one of the major risks. \u201cThe\nresupply of the advanced units of the enemy's 30th Motor Rifle Brigade, which\nhas broken through in Ocheretyne, is effectively blocked by the Ukrainian\ndefense forces, who maintain complete fire control over this route.\u201d\n\nIn penetrating five miles into Ukrainian territory, the most westerly Russian\ntroops are essentially alone and far removed from their main supply lines.\nThey\u2019re vulnerable. If Ukrainian troops can starve them before Russian\nreinforcements widen the salient and stiffen their logistics, the Russians may\nyet lose this fight.\n\nThat\u2019s the optimistic outcome for the outnumbered, outgunned Ukrainian\nbrigades around Ocheretyne. The realistic outcome is that they attempt a\nfighting retreat to the west.\n\nBut the Ukrainians are desperate to avoid retreating. It\u2019s just too risky.\n\nFollow me on Twitter.
