Beall\n\nThis is a list of questionable, scholarly open-access publishers. We recommend\nthat scholars read the available reviews, assessments and descriptions\nprovided here, and then decide for themselves whether they want to submit\narticles, serve as editors or on editorial boards. In a few cases, non-open\naccess publishers whose practices match those of predatory publishers have\nbeen added to the list as well. The criteria for determining predatory\npublishers are here. We hope that tenure and promotion committees can also\ndecide for themselves how importantly or not to rate articles published in\nthese journals in the context of their own institutional standards and/or\ngeocultural locus. We emphasize that journal publishers and journals change in\ntheir business and editorial practices over time. This list is kept up-to-date\nto the best extent possible but may not reflect sudden, unreported, or unknown\nenhancements.\n\nBeall's List, proudly powered by WordPress.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
