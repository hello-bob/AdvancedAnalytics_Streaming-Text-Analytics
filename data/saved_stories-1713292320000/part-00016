I don\u2019t have anything to add there. I appreciate the\ncourage to invent a new paradigm, but there are no excuses for shipping\nsomething so pointless after raising hundreds of millions.\n\nWhat I want to discuss is voice as an interface.\n\nMovies like Her have led us to believe that voice is the ultimate user\ninterface. Why bother with a keyboard and mouse, when you can just \u201ctalk it\nout.\u201d Just a few days ago, I heard about a talk where someone was claiming\nthat it\u2019s only a matter of time before every app becomes a voice interface\nthat uses AI agents to accomplish tasks.\n\nI can\u2019t help but think that these assumptions carry only a surface-level\nunderstanding of the human mind.\n\nOf course, voice as input is nowhere near as polished today, but let\u2019s assume\nit does become so in the near future. Is Voice poised to take over as the\nuniversal interface? I don\u2019t believe that for many reasons.\n\n  1. Voice is inherently incapable of representing abstract thoughts: When we use tools we heavily use our subconscious mind and abstract thoughts. For eg, writing and researching. Both of these activities heavily use those abilities. I won\u2019t be able to finish any article if I have to narrate everything. That\u2019s because while sometimes I have sentences fully formed in my brain, more often, I only have bits and pieces and I have to take time to string them together. I have to search for the right words, link the right ideas, or find the right research.\n\nVoice exercises part of the brain that belongs to the \u2018consciousness\u2019\ncategory, which limits these capabilities.\n\n  2. Voice makes quite a few things harder not easier: Theoretically, saying, \u201corder an Uber to airport\u201d seems like the easiest way to accomplish the task. But is it? What kind of Uber? UberXL, UberGo? There\u2019s a 1.5x surge pricing. Acceptable? Is the pickup point correct? What would be easier, resolving each of those queries through a computer asking questions, or taking a quick look yourself on the app?\n\nAnother example is food ordering. What would you prefer, going through the\nmenu from tens of restaurants yourself or constantly nudging the AI for the\ndesired option? Technological improvement can only help so much here since\nusers themselves don\u2019t clearly know what you want.\n\n  3. Voice is privacy invading: Most humans are quite self-conscious and they don\u2019t want to be seen as in public making requests to a computer. Hell, even with friends or a partner, it might get awkward. It\u2019s not just about suspicious requests, people can get paranoid about being judged even for banal ones. Checking messages, for example. This could post questions in mind like: \u201cHow frequently this guy wants to check his messages?\u201d, \u201cDoesn\u2019t he have anything else to do?\u201c.\n\n  4. UI is preferable to understand the limits of software: UI is not a hinderance, it helps us understand the capabilities of software. For eg, Google Maps. Say you want a route that isn\u2019t narrow or bad or a route that takes you through beautiful surroundings. It won\u2019t be able to do that because it doesn\u2019t have that data. Nor, without the UI it\u2019d be easy to discover that you can check the traffic conditions between two locations for a certain departure time.\n\n  5. Users don\u2019t like talking all the time: Using voice to accomplish simple tasks like setting a timer or an alarm is okay, but to accomplish everything can quickly become annoying. We don\u2019t even realize how many micro-tasks we accomplish throughout the day by familiar interfaces. Checking calendar, emails, messages, browsing. Of course, some of these tasks are a way to kill time, but killing time, too, is an important part of our culture, which isn\u2019t going anywhere.\n\n  6. Voice can\u2019t resolve real-world ambiguities: There can be tons of ambiguities in an instruction that can\u2019t be easily resolved by a voice-only interface. For example, say you want to sell 500 shares of a certain company, which amounts to 50% of your holdings. But, it was a mistaken assumption, 500 shares represent 100% of your holdings. AI won\u2019t be able to sense what you want to accomplish because it can\u2019t read your brain.\n\nOf course, you can make the same mistake on UI, but it would be more difficult\nsince there\u2019s visual feedback about your action. An audio confirmation prompt\nwon\u2019t be that effective as it\u2019s not easy to visualize the numbers in your\nhead.\n\nOverall, I am not convinced Voice is the future. There are too many inherent\nproblems in not having a screen you can interact with. And even if you add a\nscreen, Voice makes it harder to achieve many things that can be done more\neasily with a better UI. I don\u2019t think, even if AI was perfectly capable of\nunderstanding human voice and had zero latency, we would reach a future that\nHumane is envisioning.\n\nFollow Me!\n\nI write about things that I find interesting. If you're modestly geeky,\nchances are you'll find them too.\n\nSubscribe to this blog via RSS Feed.\n\nDon't have an RSS reader?
