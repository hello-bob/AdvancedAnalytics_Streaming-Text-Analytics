He\u2019s a professor of chemistry in Glasgow,\nwhere he also founded Chemify. This is a company that has invented a new type\nof approach to accomplish chemistry, very analogous to using the tool chain\nthat we use in computers and then adapting that to chemistry.\n\nDeep Future\n\n3D Printing Meth on the Moon \u2013 Lee Cronin\n\n00:00 / 01:38:39\n\nAudible Apple Podcasts RSS Spotify YouTube\n\nRSS Feed\n\nShare\n\nLink\n\nEmbed\n\nI think this analogy holds very tightly. He\u2019s built this machine called a\nChemputer, which is basically a 3D printer for chemistry. To make that work,\nhe had to make a programming language for chemistry, a GitHub for chemistry.\nHe basically had to rebuild the whole stack that we use in software, but for\nchemistry.\n\nThat\u2019s very important because chemists are still acting in this kind of a dark\nages, voodoo modality, where it\u2019s very difficult for somebody in one chemistry\nlab to replicate what you did in another one.\n\nThis is going to really change the way that chemists work, because they\u2019ll\nhave very systematic and replicable approach to what they do.\n\nLee Cronin by Robert Ormerod\n\nLee is a legitimate professor. He\u2019s the Regis Chair of Chemistry at the\nUniversity of Glasgow. He\u2019s graduating Ph.D\u2019s in chemistry and they\u2019re doing\nall kinds of amazing stuff, and I think in part because they\u2019re stuck in\nremote Scotland, there\u2019s just no adult supervision and these people are able\nto think freely and go do amazing stuff. On top of this, if you don\u2019t know\nabout Lee or some of the other things we don\u2019t get into, I highly recommend\nyou listen to his conversation with Lex Friedman on that podcast, which is\nalso wonderful and goes deep.\n\n### Important Links:\n\n  * Chemify\n  * University of Glasgow\n  * Lex Fridman podcast\n\n### About Lee Cronin\n\nLeroy \u201cLee\u201d Cronin is the Regius Chair of Chemistry in the School of Chemistry\nat the University of Glasgow. He was elected to the Fellowship of the Royal\nSociety of Edinburgh, the Royal Society of Chemistry, and appointed to the\nRegius Chair of Chemistry in 2013. He was previously the Gardiner Chair,\nappointed April 2009.\n\nCronin was awarded BSc (1994) and PhD (1997) from the University of York. From\n1997 to 1999, he was a Leverhulme fellow at the University of Edinburgh\nworking with Neil Robertson. From 1999-2000 he worked as an Alexander Von\nHumboldt research fellow in the laboratory of Achim Mueller at the University\nof Bielefeld (1999\u20132000). In 2000, he joined the University of Birmingham as a\nLecturer in Chemistry, and in 2002 he moved to a similar position at the\nUniversity of Glasgow.\n\nIn 2005, he was promoted to Reader at the University of Glasgow, EPSRC\nAdvanced Fellow followed by promotion to Professor of Chemistry in 2006, and\nin 2009 became the Gardiner Professor. In 2013, he became the Regius Professor\nof Chemistry (Glasgow).\n\nCronin gave the opening lecture at TEDGlobal conference in 2011 in Edinburgh.\nHe outlined the initial steps his team at University of Glasgow is taking to\ncreate inorganic biology, life composed of non-carbon-based material.\n\nTags: 3D Printing, Chemistry\n\n## Footer\n\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * Instagram\n  * RSS Feed\n  * Spotify\n  * Apple\n  * WhatsApp\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 \u00b7 Deep Future\n\nLoading Comments...\n\n", "frontpage": false}
