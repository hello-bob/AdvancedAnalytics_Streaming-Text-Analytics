In a Sunday morning\nblog post, the company says it is \"in the process of developing the next-\ngeneration console controller\" for the Switch 2 and has \"acquired a lot of\nfirst-hand information\" about the console as a result (MobaPad shared similar\ninsights days earlier on Chinese video site Bilibili and briefly on its\nEnglish Facebook page).\n\nChief among MobaPad's purported revelations is that \"the cartridge slot of the\nSwitch 2 will support backward compatibility with physical Switch game\ncartridges, ensuring compatibility with players' existing game libraries,\nincluding digital versions.\" Game cards designed specifically for the Switch\n2, on the other hand, \"may not be compatible with the first-generation\nconsole,\" suggesting there may be a physical change preventing Switch 2 game\ncards from being accidentally inserted into an older Switch console.\n\n## Play it forward\n\nEarlier this year, a Brazilian podcast suggested that the Switch 2 would offer\nfull backward compatibility with the current Switch library. But this is the\nfirst time we've gotten similar information directly from a company claiming\nfirst-hand knowledge of the Switch 2's design from Nintendo itself.\n\nEnlarge / It would be a shame if all those Switch game cards didn't work on\nyour next Nintendo console.\n\nJingdu / Amazon\n\nBringing forward support for thousands of existing Switch games would\ndefinitely be a boon for the tens of millions of Switch owners who might be\nlooking to upgrade to a new, more powerful Nintendo console soon. But direct\ncompetition from earlier games could be seen as limiting for Switch 2 game\ndevelopers\u2014in November 2022, Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto noted that\n\"Nintendo's strength is in our creation of new entertainment, so when we\nrelease new hardware going forward, we plan to continue to offer new and\nunique gameplay that cannot be realized on existing hardware.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHistorically, Nintendo's portable consoles have offered backward compatibility\nwith software designed for the previous generation of outgoing portable\nhardware, in a chain dating back to the original Game Boy. The Wii and Wii U\nextended this tradition to home consoles before the Switch's hybrid, disc-free\ndesign marked a hard break in software compatibility.\n\n## More buttons?\n\nElsewhere in its report, MobaPad suggests that the new Switch 2 Joy-Cons will\nhave a few additional buttons compared to the Switch's standard controllers.\nOne set of new inputs will be on the rear of each Joy-Con, just below the ZL\nor ZR button. Another \"additional function button\" reportedly sits below the\nHome button on the right Joy-Con, MobaPad says, though it's unclear what\nsystem or gameplay function this button might serve.\n\n  * A MobaPad illustration shows where a new \"rear button\" may appear on the Switch 2 Joy-Cons.\n\nhttps://www.bilibili.com/read/cv34149535/?jump_opus=1\n\n  * MobaPad says an \"additional function button\" appears below the Home button on the Switch 2.\n\nMobaPad / Bilibili\n\nPrevious SlideNext Slide\n\n### Further Reading\n\nSwitch 2 reportedly replaces slide-in Joy-Cons with magnetic attachment\n\nMobPad's report also echoes a recent report from Spanish-language news site\nVandal, which suggested that the new console would have Joy-Cons that attach\nto the system magnetically (Vandal's report cited \"several manufacturers of\naccessories and peripherals for the Nintendo console,\" which might have also\nincluded MobaPad). MobaPad says the new Joy-Cons will feature metal SL and SR\nbuttons (the ones along the slide-in rail on the Switch Joy-Cons) to help\nfacilitate this \"electromagnetic suction technology.\"\n\nElsewhere in its post, MobaPad corroborates earlier reports saying that the\nSwitch 2 will have an 8-inch screen, which MobaPad says will support 1080p\nresolutions in portable mode. MobaPad also echoes earlier reports in saying\nthat the new console can deliver upscaled 4K graphics while docked to a TV.\n\nThe still-unannounced Switch 2 is now widely expected to see release in early\n2025, reportedly to give developers more time to craft launch software. But if\nperipheral makers are getting detailed looks at the system this early, the\nactual hardware might be going to production well before that rumored launch\nwindow.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Team Designed Its Terrifying, Immersive Audio\n\n#### reader comments\n\n135\n\nKyle Orland Kyle Orland has been the Senior Gaming Editor at Ars Technica\nsince 2012, writing primarily about the business, tech, and culture behind\nvideo games.

This should be the bare minimum\nmoving forward IMO.\n\nMy biggest hope is improved joycons. Whatever they look like, the ergonomics\nneed to be better and the sticks need to be more resilient. All 4 of my\njoycons drift at this point and it's ridiculous, especially since two of them\naren't that old.\n\nApril 29, 2024 at 3:44 pm\n\n### Channel Ars Technica\n\n#### Unsolved Mysteries Of Quantum Leap With Donald P.
