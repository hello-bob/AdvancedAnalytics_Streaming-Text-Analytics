Uber seems to\nbelieve it is above the law and cabbies across London have suffered loss of\nearnings because of it. It is time they were held to account.\u201d\n\nRGL said that if the cabbies were successful in their claim they could secure\nmore than \u00a3250m, with individuals potentially winning \u00a325,000 or more.\n\nAn Uber spokesperson said: \u201cThese old claims are completely unfounded. Uber\noperates lawfully in London, is fully licensed by TfL, and is proud to serve\nmillions of passengers and drivers across the capital.\u201d\n\nIt marks the latest bout of legal trouble for Uber. In March, the San\nFrancisco-based company reached an A$272m settlement (\u00a3142m) to compensate\ntaxi and hire-car drivers who said they lost out when the company\n\u201caggressively\u201d moved into the Australian market.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Business Today\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and\nanalysis you need every morning\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

The suit also alleged\nthat the company used unlicensed cars with unaccredited drivers in a\n\u201cconspiracy by unlawful means\u201d and misled regulators.\n\nDale Forwood, a black-cab driver of 12 years, said he hoped the London case\nwould bring justice for local cabbies. \u201cI am delighted to see this claim being\nfiled today and that we will finally have our day in court,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving\nseen for myself the harm that Uber\u2019s unlawful behaviour has caused to hard-\nworking cabbies, I look forward to justice being served.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Travel & leisure\n  * Uber\n  * London\n  * Transport\n  * TfL\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Uber backs Sadiq Khan\u2019s road-charging proposals for London\n\n8 Feb 2022\n\n  * ### Uber raises London prices by 10% in effort to lure back drivers\n\n10 Nov 2021\n\n  * ### Uber granted London licence as court rules it 'no longer poses a risk'\n\n28 Sept 2020\n\n  * ### Uber drivers to launch legal bid to uncover app's algorithm\n\n20 Jul 2020\n\n  * ### Uber to launch London commuter boat service with Thames Clippers\n\n8 Jul 2020\n\n  * ### Addison Lee and Uber to install partition screens in cabs\n\n14 May 2020\n\n  * ### How London got rid of private cars \u2013 and grew more congested than ever\n\n11 Feb 2020\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncomments\n\n  * ### Uber loses London licence after TfL finds drivers faked identity\n\n25 Nov 2019\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Business\n  * Economics\n  * Banking\n  * Money\n  * Markets\n  * Project Syndicate\n  * B2B\n  * Retail\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
