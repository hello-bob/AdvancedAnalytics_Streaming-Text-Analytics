(He also\nofficial-ified it, as there appears to be a difference between the two \u2014 at\nleast at the time of this writing, who knows that could change...)\n\nPutting aside whatever it actually means to verify your own website, I thought\nit was funny.\n\nAnd it\u2019s the weekend right now, so I decided: why not give myself the ole\u2019\ncheck mark too? They seem to just be handing them out these days for the right\nprice.\n\nI suppose I pay for my check mark. It\u2019s ten dollars per year. That\u2019s what it\ncosts to own the domain for my website. I also own the content too. Seems like\na pretty good deal.\n\nOh, and my check mark comes in more than just blue. I have a color to match\neach theme of my website. I can do that because, ya know, it\u2019s my website. Got\nto get my money\u2019s worth out of that $10/year.\n\nNow I\u2019m just being silly. But hey: it\u2019s my website, I can do that.\n\n##### Reply\n\n  * Email\n  * Mastodon\n  * Twitter\n\n", "frontpage": false}
