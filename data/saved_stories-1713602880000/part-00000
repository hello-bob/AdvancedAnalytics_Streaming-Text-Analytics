The plant has about 4,300 eligible voters.\n\nThe victory is a milestone toward expanding union efforts in the southern US\nwhere labor unions have historically faced aggressive opposition and union\ndensity has lagged far behind other parts of the US.\n\nShawn Fain, president of the UAW: \u2018Workers realized they\u2019ve been getting\nscrewed for decades\u2019\n\nRead more\n\nWorkers at a Mercedes plant in Vance, Alabama are set to vote on whether to\njoin the UAW in mid-May. Shawn Fain, the UAW president, is also targeting\nTesla, whose boss, Elon Musk, has vigorously fought unionization efforts.\n\nWorkers at the plant in Chattanooga voted against the union in 2014 and 2019\nin closely contested elections. In 2014, the UAW tried to partner with\nVolkswagen management to push for a works council similar to ones the company\nhas in Germany, where Volkswagen is headquartered. But the plans faced\nsignificant backlash from anti-union groups and Bob Corker, the Republican US\nsenator whose staff was in contact with anti-union groups over messaging ahead\nof the election.\n\nThe UAW had been expected to win its latest vote given the firm support of\nworkers beforehand, a quick turnaround from filing for the election to holding\nit, and a changing culture and landscape that has seen the US labor movement\nand the surge in the UAW\u2019s popularity after its successful strike against the\nUS\u2019s domestic automakers last year.\n\nAgainst that background, Republican elected officials had been less eager to\ncome out against the UAW.\n\n\u201cThe UAW is sending a strong signal that big change may be coming to places\nwhere most thought the labor movement was dead and buried,\u201d said professor\nSharon Block, executive director of the Center for Labor and a Just Economy at\nHarvard Law School.\n\n\u201cIn the wake of the settlement of the strikes at the Big Three this fall, the\ntransplant auto companies in the south gave their workers wage increases \u2013 the\nUAW bump \u2013 thinking that they could buy off their workers on the cheap. The\nUAW\u2019s organizing campaign throughout the transplant companies in the south is\na bet that workers can\u2019t be bought off so cheaply. The UAW\u2019s message to these\nworkers is: \u2018Don\u2019t settle for crumbs.\u2019\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Volkswagen said in an email ahead of the vote: \u201cWe respect\nour workers\u2019 right to a democratic process and to determine who should\nrepresent their interests. We fully support an NLRB vote so every team member\nhas a chance to a secret ballot vote on this important decision.\n\n\u201cVolkswagen is proud of our working environment in Chattanooga that provides\nsome of the best-paying jobs in the area.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * US unions\n  * Volkswagen (VW)\n  * Tennessee\n  * Automotive industry\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
