The advertising is\npresented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change\nactions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that\nthey are in an urban zone.\n\nA large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online\nadvertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its\naudience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and\navoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles\nabout how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been\npresented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.\n\nVendors43 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * Adform\n  * Advanced store\n  * Amazon Ad Server\n  * Appier\n  * AudienceProject\n  * Bannernow\n\n1-10 / 43\n\nCreate profiles for personalised advertising\n\nInformation about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit,\ncontent you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about\nyou (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and\nother websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or\nimprove a profile about you (that might include possible interests and\npersonal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present\nadvertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by\nthis and other entities.\n\nIf you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this\ninformation could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike\naccessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a\ndifferent website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike\naccessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury\ncar manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your\ninterest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are\ninterested in luxury cycling gear.\n\nAn apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It\ngets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income\ncustomers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create\nprofiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to\nhave a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising\nwithin partner apps based on those profiles.\n\nVendors129 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * A.Mob\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdElement Media Solutions\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * AdSpirit AdServer\n  * AdTheorent\n  * AdTiming\n\n1-10 / 129\n\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\n\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising\nprofiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or\napps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and\npersonal aspects.\n\nAn online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It\nwants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on\nits mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have\npreviously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present\nyou with the corresponding advertisement on the app.\n\nA profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having\nsearched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant\nadvertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.\n\nVendors127 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * A.Mob\n  * ADventori\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdElement Media Solutions\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * AdSpirit AdServer\n  * AdTheorent\n\n1-10 / 127\n\nMeasure advertising performance\n\nInformation regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you\ninteract with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for\nyou or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For\ninstance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you\nto buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand\nthe relevance of advertising campaigns.\n\nYou have clicked on an advertisement about a \u201cblack Friday\u201d discount by an\nonline shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click\nwill be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will\nbe measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.\n\nYou are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an\n\u201cinternational appreciation day\u201d discount by an online gift shop within the\napp of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how\noften a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the \u201cinternational\nappreciation day\u201d ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in\norder to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad\nplacements.\n\nVendors76 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * Adelaide\n  * Adform\n  * Adikteev\n  * Adloox\n  * Adnami\n\n1-10 / 76\n\nUnderstand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different\nsources\n\nReports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user\nprofiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your\ninteractions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising)\ncontent to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which\ntarget audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).\n\nThe owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the\nproportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or\nconsulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as\nthe average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data\nrelating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics\nis then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.\n\nAn advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with\nits adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics\nof users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of\nsimilar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the\nadvertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile\ndevices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.\n\nVendors28 vendor(s)\n\n  * AdGear\n  * Amazon Ad Server\n  * Amobee (Nexxen)\n  * Appier\n  * AudienceProject\n  * Bombora\n  * Clinch\n  * Crimtan\n  * Emerse\n  * Google Ads\n\n1-10 / 28\n\nDevelop and improve services\n\nInformation about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with\nads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to\nbuild new products and services based on user interactions, the type of\naudience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or\nimprovement of user profiles and identifiers.\n\nA technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in\nmobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are\nconnecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads\nthat are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve\ntheir performance.\n\nAn advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer\ndevice.

But Kant\u2019s writing shows that a free, just and\nmoral life is possible \u2014 and that\u2019s relevant everywhere.\n\nCredit...Illustration by Daniel Barreto\n\nSupported by\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nBy Susan Neiman\n\nThe philosopher Susan Neiman is the director of the Einstein Forum in Potsdam,\nGermany.\n\n  * Published April 17, 2024Updated April 18, 2024\n\nWhen I arrived in Berlin in 1982, I was writing a dissertation on Kant\u2019s\nconception of reason. It was thrilling to learn that the apartment I\u2019d sublet\nturned out to be located near Kantstrasse, though at the time I wondered in\nfrustration: Why was there no James Street \u2014 Henry or William \u2014 in the\nCambridge, Mass., I\u2019d left behind; no streets honoring Emerson or Eliot? Were\nAmericans as indifferent to culture as snooty Europeans supposed? It didn\u2019t\ntake long before I, too, could walk down Kantstrasse and turn right on Leibniz\nwithout a thought.\n\nIt\u2019s harder to ignore the way Germany, like other European nations, sets aside\nentire years to honor its cultural heroes. This century has already seen an\nEinstein Year, a Beethoven Year, a Luther Year and a Marx Year, each\ncommemorating some round-numbered anniversary of the hero in question. Federal\nand local governments provide considerable sums for events that celebrate the\nthinkers in question and debate their contemporary relevance.\n\nYears before Immanuel Kant\u2019s 300th birthday on April 22, 2024, the Academy of\nScience in Berlin, to which he once belonged, organized a conference to begin\npreparations for his tercentennial. A second conference published a report of\nthe proceedings, but when I urged colleagues to use the occasion to create\nprograms for a wider audience, I was met with puzzled silence. Reaching a\nwider audience is not a talent philosophy professors normally cultivate, but\nconversations with other cultural institutions showed this case to be\nespecially thorny.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just uneasiness about celebrating \u201canother dead white man,\u201d as one\nmuseum director put it. The problems became deeper as the zeitgeist changed.\n\u201cImmanuel Kant: A European Thinker\u201d was a good title for that conference\nreport in 2019, when Brexit seemed to threaten the ideal of European\nunification Germans supported. Just a few years later, \u201cEuropean\u201d has become a\nslur. At a time when the Enlightenment is regularly derided as a Eurocentric\nmovement designed to support colonialism, who feels comfortable throwing a\nyearlong birthday party for its greatest thinker?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nNonetheless, this year\u2019s ceremonies will officially commence on April 22 with\na speech by Chancellor Scholz and a memorial lunch that has taken place on the\nphilosopher\u2019s birthday every year since 1805. Two days earlier, President\nFrank-Walter Steinmeier of Germany will open an exhibit at the presidential\npalace devoted to Kant\u2019s writing on peace.\n\nThe start of the year saw special Kant editions of four prominent German\nmagazines. A Kant movie made for television premiered on March 1, and another\nis in production. Four exhibits on Kant and the Enlightenment will open in\nBonn, L\u00fcneburg, Potsdam and Berlin. The conferences will be numerous,\nincluding one organized by the Divan, Berlin\u2019s house for Arab culture.\n\nBut why celebrate the Kant year at all?\n\nThe philosopher\u2019s occasional autobiographical remarks provide a clue to the\nanswer. As the son of a saddle maker, Kant would have led a workman\u2019s life\nhimself, had a pastor not suggested the bright lad deserved some higher\neducation. He came to love his studies and to \u201cdespise the common people who\nknew nothing,\u201d until \u201cRousseau set me right,\u201d he wrote. Kant rejected his\nearlier elitism and declared his philosophy would restore the rights of\nhumanity \u2014 otherwise they would be more useless than the work of a common\nlaborer.\n\nChutzpah indeed. The claim becomes even more astonishing if you read a random\npage of his texts. How on earth, you may ask, are human rights connected with\nproving our need to think in categories like \u201ccause\u201d or \u201csubstance?\u201d The\nquestion is seldom raised, and the autobiographical remarks usually ignored,\nfor traditional readings of Kant focus on his epistemology, or theory of\nknowledge.\n\nBefore Kant, it\u2019s said, philosophers were divided between Rationalists and\nEmpiricists, who were concerned about the sources of knowledge. Does it come\nfrom our senses, or our reason? Can we ever know if anything is real? By\nshowing that knowledge requires sensory experience as well as reason, we\u2019re\ntold, Kant refuted the skeptics\u2019 worry that we never know if anything exists\nat all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAll this is true, but it hardly explains why the poet Heinrich Heine found\nKant more ruthlessly revolutionary than Robespierre. Nor does it explain why\nKant himself said only pedants care about that kind of skepticism. Ordinary\npeople do not fret over the reality of tables or chairs or billiard balls.\nThey do, however, wonder if ideas like freedom and justice are merely\nfantasies. Kant\u2019s main goal was to show they are not.\n\nThe point is often missed, because Kant was as bad a writer as he was a great\nphilosopher. By the time he finishes proving the existence of the objects of\nordinary experience and is ready to show how they differ from ideas of reason,\nthe semester is nearly over. Long-windedness is not, however, the only reason\nhis work is often misinterpreted. Consider the effects of a bad review.\n\nHad Kant died before his 57th birthday, he\u2019d be remembered by a few scholars\nfor some short, early texts. He withdrew from writing them in 1770 to conceive\nand compose his great \u201cCritique of Pure Reason.\u201d After what scholars call his\n\u201csilent decade,\u201d Kant pulled the text together in six months and finally\npublished in 1781. For a year and a half, Kant waited for responses. When one\nfinally appeared, it was a hatchet job accusing him of being a Berkeleyan\nsolipsist: someone who denies the existence of ordinary objects.\n\nAny author can imagine Kant\u2019s dismay, and most likely his rage. In haste to\nrefute the distortion of his life\u2019s work, Kant wrote a second edition of the\n\u201cCritique of Pure Reason,\u201d and more fatefully, the \u201cProlegomena.\u201d Since the\nlatter is much shorter than the main book, it\u2019s read far more often, and this\nhas skewed the interpretation of Kant\u2019s work as a whole. If the major problem\nof philosophy were proving the world\u2019s existence, then Kant surely solved it.\n(Richard Rorty argued that he did, and that philosophy has little more to\noffer.)\n\nIn fact Kant was driven by a question that still plagues us: Are ideas like\nfreedom and justice utopian daydreams, or are they more substantial? Their\nreality can\u2019t be proven like that of material objects, for those ideas make\nentirely different claims on us \u2014 and some people are completely impervious to\ntheir claims. Could philosophy show that acting morally, if not particularly\ncommon, is at least possible?\n\nA stunning thought experiment answers that question in his next book, the\n\u201cCritique of Practical Reason.\u201d Kant asks us to imagine a man who says\ntemptation overwhelms him whenever he passes \u201ca certain house.\u201d (The 18th\ncentury was discreet.) But if a gallows were constructed to insure the fellow\nwould be hanged upon exiting the brothel, he\u2019d discover he can resist\ntemptation very well. All mortal temptations fade in the face of threats to\nlife itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nYet the same man would hesitate if asked to condemn an innocent man to death,\neven if a tyrant threatened to execute him instead. Kant always emphasized the\nlimits of our knowledge, and none of us know if we would crumble when faced\nwith death or torture. Most of us probably would. But all of us know what we\nshould do in such a case, and we know that we could.\n\nThis experiment shows we are radically free. Not pleasure but justice can move\nhuman beings to deeds that overcome the deepest of animal desires, the love of\nlife. We want to determine the world, not only to be determined by it. We are\nborn and we die as part of nature, but we feel most alive when we go beyond\nit: To be human is to refuse to accept the world we are given.\n\nAt the heart of Kant\u2019s metaphysics stands the difference between the way the\nworld is and the way the world ought to be. His thought experiment is an\nanswer to those who argue that we are helpless in the face of pleasure and can\nbe satisfied with bread and circuses \u2014 or artisanal chocolate and the latest\niPhone. If that were true, benevolent despotism would be the best form of\ngovernment.\n\nBut if we long, in our best moments, for the dignity of freedom and justice,\nKant\u2019s example has political consequences. It\u2019s no surprise he thought the\nFrench Revolution confirmed our hopes for moral progress \u2014 unlike the\nfollowers of his predecessor David Hume, who thought it was dangerous to stray\nfrom tradition and habit.\n\nThis provides an answer to contemporary critics whose reading of Kant\u2019s work\nfocuses on the ways in which it violates our understanding of racism and\nsexism. Some of his remarks are undeniably offensive to 21st-century ears. But\nit\u2019s fatal to forget that his work gave us the tools to fight racism and\nsexism, by providing the metaphysical basis of every claim to human rights.\n\nKant argued that each human being must be treated as an end and not as a means\n\u2014 which is why he called colonialism \u201cevil\u201d and congratulated the Chinese and\nJapanese for denying entry to European invaders. Contemporary dismissals of\nEnlightenment thinkers forget that those thinkers invented the concept of\nEurocentrism, and urged their readers to consider the world from non-European\nperspectives. Montesquieu put his criticisms of French society in the mouths\nof fictitious Persians; Lahontan attacked European politics through dialogues\nwith a Native American.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt a time when the advice to \u201cbe realistic\u201d is best translated as the advice\nto decrease your expectations, Kant\u2019s work asks deep questions about what\nreality is. He insisted that when we think morally, we should abstract from\nthe cultural differences that divide us and recognize the potential human\ndignity in every human being. This requires the use of our reason. Contrary to\ntrendy views that see reason as an instrument of domination, Kant saw reason\u2019s\npotential as a tool for liberation.\n\nHe also argued that political and social relations must aim toward justice\nrather than power, however often those may be confused in practice. We\u2019ve come\nto better understand how racism and sexism can preclude genuine universalism.\nShould we discard Kant\u2019s commitment to universalism because he did not fully\nrealize it himself \u2014 or rather celebrate the fact that we can make moral\nprogress, an idea which Kant would wholeheartedly applaud?\n\nIn Germany, it\u2019s now common to hear that the Enlightenment was at very best\nambivalent: While it may have been an age of reason, it was also an age of\nslavery and colonialism. This argument ignores the fact that, like progressive\nintellectuals everywhere, Enlightenment thinkers did not win all their\nbattles. It also neglects the fact that they fought for them anyway, despite\nthe risks of censorship, exile and even death.\n\nSignificantly, many contemporary intellectuals from formerly colonized\ncountries reject those arguments. Thinkers like the Ghanaian Ato Sekyi-Otu,\nthe Nigerian Olufemi Taiwo, the Chilean Carlos Pe\u00f1a, the Brazilian Francisco\nBosco or the Indian Benjamin Zachariah are hardly inclined to renounce\nEnlightenment ideas as Eurocentric.\n\nThe problem with ideas like universal human rights is not that they come from\nEurope, but that they were not realized outside of it. Perhaps we should take\na lesson from the Enlightenment and listen to non-Western standpoints?\n\nA version of this article appears in print on May 2, 2024, Section C, Page 1 of the New York edition with the headline: Vision Of a World Liberated By Reason.
