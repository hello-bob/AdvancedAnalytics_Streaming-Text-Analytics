Two more\ncommercial ships followed later Thursday, including a vehicle carrier headed\nto Panama.\n\nTheir long-awaited voyages marked an important step in the ongoing cleanup and\nrecovery effort as crews have been working around the clock to clear thousands\nof tons of mangled steel and concrete from the entrance to Baltimore\u2019s harbor.\n\nFive vessels that have been stranded for weeks are expected to finally leave\nBaltimore through the new, temporary channel. Other ships are scheduled to\nenter the port, which normally processes more cars and farm equipment than any\nother in the country.\n\nThousands of longshoremen, truckers and small business owners have seen their\njobs impacted by the collapse, prompting local and state officials to\nprioritize reopening the port and restoring its traffic to normal capacity in\nhopes of easing the economic ripple effects of the collapse. Officials have\nalso established various assistance programs for unemployed workers and others\nimpacted by the closure.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nBaltimore port to open deeper channel, enabling some cargo ships to pass after\nbridge collapse\n\nBaltimore leaders accuse ship\u2019s owner and manager of negligence in Key Bridge\ncollapse\n\nThird temporary channel opens for vessels to Baltimore port after bridge\ncollapse\n\nOn Thursday morning, the Balsa 94 moved through the channel guided by two tug\nboats, one in front and one behind. It glided slowly past the fallen bridge\nand grounded Dali, the massive container ship that caused the collapse when it\nslammed into one of the bridge\u2019s support columns.\n\nPieces of the steel span are still blocking other parts of the port\u2019s main\nchannel, which has a controlling depth of 50 feet (15 meters), enough to\naccommodate some of the largest cargo and cruise ships on the water.\n\nThe Balsa 94 is expected to arrive in Canada on Monday.\n\nThe Dali lost power and veered off course shortly after leaving the Port of\nBaltimore bound for Sri Lanka last month.\n\nSix members of a roadwork crew \u2014 all Latino immigrants from Mexico, Guatemala,\nEl Salvador and Honduras \u2014 plunged to their deaths in the collapse. Four\nbodies have been recovered from the underwater wreckage while two remain\nmissing.\n\nA memorial for the victims near the south end of the bridge has grown in\nrecent weeks. It now includes six large wooden crosses decorated with flags\nfrom the victims\u2019 home countries and other personal items, including the\nhardhats and work boots that allowed them to provide for their families and\nchase the American dream. A painted canvas backdrop displays abstract scenes\nfrom the bridge collapse and salvage efforts as well as handwritten notes from\nthe men\u2019s loved ones.\n\n\u201cWe want to send a message to the world that we\u2019re here and we care,\u201d said the\nartist, Roberto Marquez, who was visiting the memorial late Thursday morning.\n\u201cWe will be here working until they are all recovered.\u201d\n\nThe new channel will remain open until Monday or Tuesday and then close again\nuntil roughly May 10. During the closure, crews will work to remove steel\nspans from the deck of the Dali and refloat the ship, which will then be\nguided back into the port, officials said earlier this week.\n\nThe port\u2019s main channel is set to reopen next month after the Dali has been\nremoved from the collapse site. That will allow for a normal flow of traffic\nto resume through the port.\n\nBut for now, the 35-foot depth is a substantial increase over the three other\ntemporary channels established in recent weeks. It puts the cleanup effort\nslightly ahead of schedule, as officials previously said they hoped to open a\nchannel of that depth by the end of April.\n\nA hulking vehicle carrier named Carmen that is nearly as long as the Dali\nbecame the third commercial ship to traverse the channel Thursday afternoon.\nViewed from the deck of a nearby passenger boat, it appeared to sail steadily\nbetween the marker buoys, dwarfing the cranes, barges and other wreckage\nremoval equipment that was stationed nearby.\n\nEven with commercial ships chugging past, crews continued the arduous process\nof clearing debris from the collapse site. On Thursday, they were using a\ncrane apparatus to smash the fallen roadway into more manageable pieces that\ncould be lifted from underwater with a giant claw.\n\nIn a court filing Monday, Baltimore\u2019s mayor and city council called for the\nDali\u2019s owner and manager to be held fully liable for the bridge collapse,\nwhich they said could be devastating for the regional economy. They said the\nport, which was established before the nation\u2019s founding, has long been an\neconomic driver for Baltimore and the surrounding area. Losing the bridge\nitself has also disrupted a major east coast trucking route.\n\nThe filing came in response to an earlier petition on behalf of the two\ncompanies asking a court to cap their liability under a pre-Civil War\nprovision of an 1851 maritime law \u2014 a routine procedure for such cases. A\nfederal court in Maryland will ultimately decide who\u2019s responsible and how\nmuch they owe.\n\nIn the meantime, both the FBI and the National Transportation Safety Board are\nconducting probes to determine what caused the ship to lose power and strike\nthe bridge.\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to\nfactual reporting.
