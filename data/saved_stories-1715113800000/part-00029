It made me\nread Waking Up! A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion (2014) by Sam Harris.\nA new, foreign world opened in front of me. For example, Sam Harris made a\ntrip to the Himalayas with some other Western meditation experts in order to\nlearn from different meditation gurus.\n\nHe writes:\n\n> \u201cA woman from Switzerland became \u201cenlightened\u201d in Poonja-ji\u2019s presence. For\n> the better part of a week, she was celebrated as something akin to the next\n> Buddha.\u201d1\n\nWhat was the woman's big alleged achievement? She claimed that she didn't\nthink! She was completely empty-minded, she bragged. But the woman was\nrevealed to be a fraud. A better guru called Tulku Urgyen made her realize\nthat she was actually thinking all the time. People, including the woman\nherself, had mistaken her blissful state of mind for real enlightenment. In\nfact, she was just an ordinary stupid happy person!\n\nSam Harris told this anecdote in order to praise Tulku Urgyen and criticize\nPoonja-ji. But for me, as an outsider, the relevant part of the story is that\na group of well-off, middle class people actually went to the Himalayas in\norder to politely compete over who was the most brainless.\n\n###\n\nFish in water\n\nWhy would people arrange some status competition over whose head is the\nemptiest? I find it perfectly easy to understand the problem with human\nexistence that Sam Harris describes: People walk around constantly a bit\ndissatisfied. Whatever happens, they always find something that could be\nimproved and feel annoyed about the perceived lack of perfection. People can't\nappreciate a beautiful landscape, they can\u2019t appreciate the feats of human\ningenuity, they can\u2019t even appreciate their own families because they\nconstantly find flaws that someone should fix.\n\n> \u201cThe warmth of the sun feels wonderful on your skin, but soon it becomes too\n> much of a good thing. A move to the shade brings immediate relief, but after\n> a minute or two, the breeze is just a little too cold. Do you have a sweater\n> in the car? Let\u2019s take a look. Yes, there it is. You\u2019re warm now, but you\n> notice that your sweater has seen better days. Does it make you look\n> carefree or disheveled? Perhaps it is time to go shopping for something new.\n> And so it goes.\u201d2\n\nI entirely get what he means. I just don't get the solution. Why is the\nsolution to that problem to empty one's head of thoughts and to overcome the\nsense of an \u201cI\u201d, of all things?\n\nAfter having read for a while, I realized that Sam Harris, and tons of people\nwith him, live in another world than I do, with very different problems. His\nsolution to the problem of dissatisfaction with life and self-obsession makes\nno sense to me, because I have another solution: I work. Not in the modern\nsense, through negotiating all day long with people in an office, but in the\ntraditional sense: I build things, I grow things, I wash the dishes and I chop\nwood. Those activities give me something akin to the calm, matter-of-factly\nperception of reality that Sam Harris and millions of people like him get\nthrough meditation.\n\nThat way, explaining the virtues of meditation to me is a bit like explaining\nthe concept of water to a fish. I suspect that the reason why I fail to\nunderstand the point of meditation is that I'm often in a kind-of-meditative\nstate myself. Not any of the most advanced states that elite meditationers\nbrag of on Twitter, of course. Just very ordinary, basic states of meditative\nmindsets. And those are good enough for me. That way, I don't spontaneously\nunderstand the idea that humans need to deliberately modify their minds. I'm\nalready modifying my mind in that direction, every day, without thinking very\nmuch about it.\n\n###\n\nForeign language\n\nAnother book I read recently emboldened me in this assumption: How Emotions\nare Made (2017), by Lisa Feldman Barrett. (It was one of the recommendations\non the Wood from Eden book recommendations page, posted by Ken, who writes a\nblog called Vamps. Please write more book recommendations - at least I really\nappreciate them and I read at least some pages of all books recommended).\n\nHow Emotions are Made conveys the hypothesis that above very basic states of\nmind like feeling good and feeling bad, emotions are cultural constructs. For\nexample, different languages have different expressions for emotions. German\n(and Swedish) have a word for Schadenfreude. English doesn't. But surely\nEnglish-speakers could feel something like schadenfreude also before a German-\nspeaking person imported that word into the English language? They just\ncouldn't talk about it. They had to feel it all on their own.\n\nAlso, the Ilongot, a headhunting tribe in the Philippines has a word for an\nemotion called liget. It describes the sense of collective excitement from\ngoing to war against another group.3 The Ilongot are one of few peoples in the\nworld that can talk about that feeling using one word. But does that mean\nother people do not feel it? The young American soldiers in Iraq described in\nGeneration Kill used to yell \u201cget some!\u201d at each other when they were heading\ninto dangerous missions.4 Didn't they feel some liget as well?\n\nIn the same way, meditation is not a word describing a state of mind for all\nusers of the English language. For many, if not most English-speakers, it is\nnot a description of a state of mind, but of a pattern of behavior: The word\njust means something weird that some middle class people do.\n\nDoes this lack of words mean that most English-speakers never experience\nstates of mind associated with meditation? I'm convinced that people can\nexperience states of mind without having words for them. Just like English-\nspeakers could experience schadenfreude before the word was imported from\nGerman, people who never think about meditation should be able to experience\nmeditative mindsets. Not intentionally and deliberately, but unintentionally,\nwhen they work.\n\n###\n\nWorkers are already doing that\n\nThe more I read about meditation, the more I got the thought: But workers are\nalready doing that! If not exactly that-that, something largely similar. Just\nlike meditation people, workers:\n\n  1. become brainless\n\n  2. focus on material phenomena\n\n  3. forget themselves\n\n  4. forget hunger, thirst and pain\n\n####\n\n1\\. Become brainless\n\nI don't feel the need to go to the Himalayas to empty my head, because my head\nalready gets too empty when I work too much with practical stuff. When I run\nout of thoughts, I even start to obsessively repeat some mantra. Like any guru\non any mountain, but obsessively and involuntarily instead of deliberately.\nThe mantra often is a slightly strange-sounding name, like \u201cSaffron Siskind\nthe San Franciscan\u201d (Thank you for that one, Scott Alexander!). My problem is\nnot that my head is too filled with thoughts. To the contrary, I need to\nrefill it constantly so I don't run out of meaningful thoughts when I work and\nhave to repeat meaningless word sequences to myself.\n\nWhy is there music blaring in most workplaces? Probably because the workers\nbecome unpleasantly empty-minded if they get no mental input at all.\n\n####\n\n2\\. Focus on material phenomena\n\nSam Harris writes that the first thing to do in order to learn to meditate is\nto sit upright, close your eyes and focus on your own breathing. You are\nsupposed to attentively feel how breathing is being done and direct all\nwandering thoughts to the breathing.5 I can do that - and it makes me a bit\ncalmer than the moment before, actually.\n\nBut I don't find the effect very different from the effect of focusing on\nanything that is of material nature and working as it should. Focusing on\nberries going through my hands into a bucket is not very different - I feel a\nbit calmer from that too.\n\nWorking at a too-fast tempo is not meditative. Working with tasks that are not\nmanageable is not meditative. But as long as the work is as unproblematic as\nbreathing, focusing on my object of work is as calm-inducing as focusing on my\nown physiological processes.\n\nAnd curiously, I think working with the material world leads people to the\nhighest goal of them all, according to Sam Harris: The death of the ego.\n\n####\n\n3\\. Forget themselves\n\nAt first I found Sam Harris\u2019 skepsis toward the ego very difficult to\nunderstand. He writes that one should liberate oneself from the feeling that\nthere is a seeing \u201cI\u201d behind one's eyeballs.\n\nI'm usually not feeling burdened by such an illusion when I look at things. To\nthe contrary, I have the illusion that the image in front of me is one of\nobjective reality. I have to think in order to realize that it is just I, a\nsubjective being, that am perceiving things in a certain way.\n\nFor example, I might see a tree with ivy growing on it, thinking that if I\ndon't do anything about it, the ivy will overgrow the entire tree, so I need\nto cut the ivy that climbs on the branches. The \u201cI\u201d here is a kind of gnome\nwith shears - how can anyone want to eliminate such an innocent existence?\n\nMy guess is that the \u201cI\u201d Sam Harris is talking about is not that anonymous\ndoer, but an entity that takes form in the friction with the \u201cyou\u201d and \u201che\u201d\nand \u201cshe\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d. It is in relation to other people that we develop our\nsharp-edged sense of identity. When I have other people in front of me -\nespecially people with whom I'm feeling a bit tense - I also have that feeling\nof an \u201cI\u201d behind my eyes. Like, a week ago, when I went to a village\ngathering. I was wearing my working jacket with yellow reflex bands (the same\none I\u2019m wearing in the photo at the end of this article). When I was there I\ndiscovered that people had \u201cdressed up\u201d for the occasion - apparently the\ndress code was inconspicuous, but neat, outdoor wear. I kept seeing myself\nfrom the outside, thinking of how much of a bad impression I made in my ill-\nchosen jacket. Seeing people meant being seen by people.\n\nMy guess is that such a socially induced \u201cI\u201d is the only \u201cI\u201d many people ever\nexperience. For example, take all those women who say \u201cI'm not doing it for\nothers, I'm doing it for myself\u201d regarding their make-up, hair-dyes, plastic\nsurgery and fashionable clothes. For them \u201cmyself\u201d must be something that only\nexists in immediate relation to other people.\n\nWhen I moved to the countryside and started working with practical stuff, I\nquickly learned one thing: The most dangerous thing a worker can do is to ask\nthemselves: How do I look now? If I'm hammering in nails and shift perspective\nto seeing myself from the outside, I can be almost certain that something will\ngo wrong very quickly. In the worst case I will hit my thumb. In the best case\nI will bend the nail. There is no possible good outcome of it - thinking of\noneself in a social sense ruins all physical work that requires concentration.\nWorkers need to overcome their egos just to get things done.\n\n####\n\n4\\. Forget hunger, thirst and pain\n\nMeditation practitioner Superb Owl has written about how to handle physical\npain through meditation: The trick is to focus on a sensation of pain as just\na sensation, decoupled from the usual interpretation of the sensation as\npainful.\n\nI can easily do that over lighter pain. Not because I meditate, but because I\nwork. When a piece of firewood hits my shin for the n:th time, I quickly\nnotice what happened: a very well-known and non-dangerous kind of accident. I\nknow that I can safely ignore such an accident and just move on. So I'm doing\nexactly as Superb Owl: I just notice a sensation and think of it like just a\nsensation. That way I don't have to waste time on experiencing minor pain.\n\nMeditation practitioners learn to ignore hunger, thirst, rain and cold and\nheat. Workers do the same, to one degree or another. They are ignoring\ndiscomfort in favor of the task they are performing. They can't obsess over a\nsweater like the person in Sam Harris\u2019 example, because they have a job to do.\n\n###\n\nCapitalism killed meditative work\n\nMy guess is that in an evolutionary sense, the feeling of mindfulness arose\naround repetitive physical work. The individuals who could get into some kind\nof mental flow when they worked could work more persistently than those who\ndid not enjoy work one bit.\n\nBut there is a downside to it too: People who enjoy work too much tend to\nbecome a bit inefficient. I know it from my own experience. When Anders comes\nwith creative suggestions of how he could use the tractor to improve my\nfirewood logistics I tend to get annoyed. I don't want to hear that the work I\nenjoy is a bit inefficient, even if it is objectively true.\n\nNowadays, few workers can hold on to such preferences. For most of human\nhistory, a meditative working style functioned very well. Who was the very\nfastest worker was not that important. That changed with capitalism. The\nmarket economy is a competition over who can work the fastest - by any means:\nTechnology, logistics or mere pressure on workers.\n\nCapitalism is a competition in overcoming nature. Both the nature of the\nmaterial world and human nature. Companies in the capitalistic market economy\ncompete to overcome the laziness, conservatism and individualism that makes\nhumans inefficient producers. And, also, they compete to overcome the\nspontaneous joy of work that also makes humans less than optimally efficient\nproducers.\n\n###\n\nSuicide instead of fratricide\n\nAfter having read half a book about meditation, I summarized the practice in\ntwo words: Not war. The quiet self-denial of meditation equals not-fighting.\n\nI'm loosely suspecting that the practice of meditation arose in order for\nexcess sons of warrior classes to calm down. As a rule, warrior dynasties\nproduce too many sons. The alternative, too few sons, is even worse. But\nexcess sons certainly are problematic, since they tend to lead to rivalries\nand civil war. In Turkey under the Sultanate, the Sultan sired numerous sons\nwith harem slaves. After a devastating civil war in the 15th century, a law\nthat allowed the winning son to kill his brothers was made.6\n\nFratricide has obvious disadvantages. It is clearly brutal. It stands in\nopposition to another very important part of human nature: Alliances between\nclose male kin. For that reason, a religion that encourages some sons to be as\nquiet and undemanding as possible serves a purpose. Actually, some branches of\nBuddhism idealizes certain kinds of suicide - meditating until death is seen\nas a high ideal. According to legend, Siddhartha Gautama was a prince. A\nprince who gathered a following around his own wish to perish. In a society\nthat overproduced upper class people (like all societies tend to do), a\nreligion celebrating non-existence could help increase social order.\n\nI guess that buddhist kingdoms couldn't tell their excess sons to just get a\nhobby. They needed them to be humble. But they also needed to preserve their\nsocial status above the working masses. That way, their religion re-launched\nthe humility of working people in fancier and more extreme forms.\n(Christianity expressively did much of the same, although it partially builds\non other mechanisms for peacefulness and humility).\n\n###\n\nFight the materia\n\nMeditation is one opposite to war. Work is another. And I think they both\nbuild on the same mechanisms in the evolved human psyche. I think the calm,\nnon-fighting instincts that meditation builds on evolved as an adaptation to\nwork, in opposition to the warlike side of human existence.\n\nMy purpose of this essay is not to say that meditation is useless. As things\nare, we live in a human zoo where many, maybe most people are actually banned\nfrom doing almost any useful practical work. People living in urban apartment\ncomplexes almost can\u2019t do anything more offensive than breathing. In that\ncase, focusing on breathing is the way to go.\n\nAlso, not all people are practically inclined. Even in a perfect world where\neveryone is free to take an ax and chop some wood, some people would just not\nfind the inspiration to do it, or have the ability and health to do it.\n\nMy purpose here is not to say that meditation is bad and that everyone\ncurrently sitting on a yoga mat should pick up an ax instead. Meditation and\nmanual work are two roads to the same goal: A peaceful live-and-let-live\nexistence. Either people avoid fighting each other through avoiding all kinds\nof fights. Or they avoid fighting each other through fighting the materia\ninstead. In a peaceful future, both options are likely to be useful.\n\nWood-based cross-training! I'm sure city people somewhere pay a fortune for\nthe opportunity to lift pieces of logs from spot A to spot B.\n\nRead a good book recently?
