I am sharing a guideline for exploring ideas\ntogether with your team that promises to deliver some fruitful ideas.\n\nMicha\u0142 Poczwardowski\n\nFeb 23, 2024\n\n8\n\nShare this post\n\n#### On Generating Ideas - Leadership & Work\n\nread.perspectiveship.com\n\n2\n\nShare\n\nImagine a brainstorming scene from a movie. We see a group of people loudly\ndiscussing ideas in a conference room. They are screaming at each other and\ndrawing on the whiteboard. The boss is in front of them firing questions and\nfinally someone comes up with a good idea, then a few others build on that and\nthe final solution is clarified. End of scene. They have just saved the\ncompany from bankruptcy or saved the Earth from a collision with an asteroid.\nThis is not how the process of generating ideas should look but it is\nimpressive in movies.\n\nDuring my career I faced a need to build new processes and work on new\ninitiatives dozens of times. These challenges required clever ideas and novel\nsolutions. I borrowed the brains of my team members, our leadership team, as\noften as I could.\n\nThis is Perspectiveship.

In this article I am sharing an easy\nframework for exploring ideas together with your team that promises to deliver\nsome fruitful ideas.\n\nI believe that our own perspective alone is not enough to have a complete view\nof the problem and possible solutions.\n\n#\n\nBaseline - Human Nature\n\nWe need to keep in mind some facets of human nature in a group setting:\n\n  * We want to be accepted and aligned with a group (conformity).\n\n  * We unconsciously agree more often than we should with our bosses (authority bias).\n\n  * We are different. There are introverts who will not share their ideas out loud in a brainstorming session, while extroverts will try to steal the show.\n\n  * We don\u2019t want to look stupid. This blocks a lot of interesting ideas from being said out loud.\n\nIn a brainstorming session we have just a single channel of discussion which\nis a bottleneck for generating new ideas and it favours people who thrive in\nsuch an environment. To prevent relying on a single communication channel and\naddress the various facets of human nature, quiet idea generation comes into\nplay.\n\n#\n\nQuiet Idea Generation\n\nThe core of Quiet Idea Generation for leaders is the following:\n\n  1. State clearly what you are going to generate ideas for and make sure that participants understand the context.\n\n  2. Set a fixed amount of time to concentrate. Also, set a minimum number of ideas to generate, not a maximum, as quantity beats quality in Quiet Idea Generation. This prevents overthinking.\n\n  3. Ask your team to work quietly for 10-15 minutes to generate and write down as many ideas as they can. Make sure that they cannot see each other\u2019s ideas during this time.\n\n  4. When the time runs out, ask each participant to present their ideas one by one. You can group the ideas together as they are being revealed. Make sure that neither you nor the group judge the ideas as there are no bad ones. To prevent any authority bias I always preferred to be the last one revealing my own ideas.\n\n  5. Congratulations, the process of generating ideas is over.\n\nFeel free to experiment with it as much as you like. This approach worked for\nme many times and delivered good results that I would not have been able to\ndeliver alone. I usually tested this approach in groups no bigger than six,\nbut the format can be adjusted for bigger teams.\n\nFurther actions depend on the goal for the session. For me, the next step was\nusually voting for the best ideas together. Then, we used a matrix of low/high\nimpact and low/high effort to prioritise the results and take it from there.\nHowever, that\u2019s something outside of the scope of this post.\n\n#\n\nSummary\n\nWhat we see in movies does not often work in reality. Brainstorming sessions\nshould not be full of thunder, strong wind and chaotic thoughts. It may work\nfor some people but I prefer a structured, stable and calmer approach.\nAddressing human nature restrictions can lead to surprising positive results,\nand using what we know about psychology can help us harness the potential of\nour teams.\n\nI wish you a fruitful Quiet Idea Generation.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n### Subscribe to Perspectiveship\n\nBy Micha\u0142 Poczwardowski\n\nThe Newsletter for Insightful Leaders and Curious Minds. | \"perspectiveship\" - the skill or ability to look at the world from different perspectives.\n\n8 Likes\n\n8\n\nShare this post\n\n#### On Generating Ideas - Leadership & Work\n\nread.perspectiveship.com\n\n2\n\nShare\n\n2 Comments\n\nmat.dobekFeb 26Liked by Micha\u0142 PoczwardowskiHey great post!Expand full\ncommentLike (1)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 reply by Micha\u0142 Poczwardowski\n\n1 more comment...\n\nOn Managing Expectations - Leadership & Work\n\nWhen people casually ask me what I do as an engineering manager: I answer that\nI'm in the business of managing expectations.\n\nFeb 9 \u2022\n\nMicha\u0142 Poczwardowski\n\n12\n\nShare this post\n\n#### On Managing Expectations - Leadership & Work\n\nread.perspectiveship.com\n\n2\n\nOn Writing at Work\n\nJust 3 steps for better communication.
