With millions of devices worldwide utilizing\nOpenVPN, our findings shed light on security risks on a global scale.\n\nThis session will explore the technical intricacies of our research, revealing\nhow we uncovered these zero-days in OpenVPN. OpenVPN, being a complex multi-\nprocess system running across different privilege levels, including kernel\ncomponents, relies heavily on OS APIs. We'll explain how this understanding\nhelped us identify logical vulnerabilities. The actual exploits additionally\ndemanded a deep inspection at the bit and byte level and using reverse\nengineering. Attendees can expect a comprehensive description of a subset of\nidentified zero-days, including a detailed root-cause analysis.\n\nWe will be focusing on demonstrating an exploit chain that starts with remote\ncode execution. The chain starts by remotely attacking OpenVPN's plugin\nmechanism, then we crash the NT System service by exploiting the stack\noverflow in OpenVPN system service. This results in a named pipe instance\ncreation race condition that allows us to reclaim OpenVPN's named pipe\nresource. Afterward, we will present an exploit that will impersonate a\nprivileged user, resulting in privilege escalation and eventually leading to\nkernel code execution by BYOVD (bring your own vulnerable driver) by loading a\nvulnerable signed driver.\n\nThe presentation will also cover mitigation techniques, providing valuable\ninsights into defending against potential attack scenarios. A demo will be\npresented, displaying a complete attack chain that includes RCE, LPE and KCE\n(via BYOVD) on the target system.\n\nDiscover more from Informa Tech\n\n  * Dark Reading\n  * SecTor\n  * Black Hat Trainings\n  * Omdia\n\nWorking With Us\n\n  * About Us\n  * Code of Conduct\n  * Contact us\n  * Upcoming Events\n\nFollow on Social\n\n  * Cookie\n  * CCPA: Do not sell my personal info\n  * Privacy\n  * Terms\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Informa PLC.
