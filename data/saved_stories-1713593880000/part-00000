Another clever idea \u2014 proposed by Jennifer Hamon on Akratics\nAnonymous \u2014 is to set up a script to automatically delete important files if\nyou don\u2019t keep making progress on a writing project.\n\nI hate all those ideas.\n\n#### \u201cStickK\u2019s anti-charities seem the most egregious, actively harming the\nworld.\u201d\n\nTake my thoughts on this with a huge grain of salt, given my conflict of\ninterest, but I really dislike commitment devices that destroy things \u2014 either\ninformation or other forms of value. StickK\u2019s anti-charities [2] seem the most\negregious, actively harming the world. I\u2019m certainly motivated to not allow\nthe world to become a worse place, so it\u2019s not that it would be ineffective as\na commitment contract. Just that I\u2019m also motivated to prevent things that\ndon\u2019t make the world worse in any way, like paying money to a third party\n(who\u2019s not evil).\n\nAt the other extreme, I\u2019m skeptical of commitment contracts where the\nbeneficiary is a (good) charity because what kind of jerk is motivated to not\ngive to charity? If you set an amount that you really can\u2019t afford then that\ncan work. Unfortunately no one seems to ever have the guts to do that.\n\nSo, yes, this is all an elaborate rationalization for Beeminder getting all\nthe money! I\u2019m serious though, I think the economics / psychology / behavioral\neconomics are sound. Commitment contracts should be socially efficient and\ndeleting even files on your own computer isn\u2019t!\n\nIn fact, if you set up a commitment device where you destroyed your computer\nif you didn\u2019t stay on your yellow brick road then I actually would call that\nkind of immoral, even though it was your own computer. Because you could\u2019ve\ninstead given it away and not wasted anything. Burning money, in contrast,\ndoesn\u2019t waste anything (except some paper). [3]\n\nSo I\u2019m fine with the hypothetical money-shredding alarm clock, even though no\none would ever actually use one of those. (There are some clever phone apps\nthat make you jump through various hoops to make the alarm turn off that might\nbe useful though.) And I guess, if I\u2019m to be true to my principles, Aherk is\nfine too, from a social efficiency point of view, as long as your friends\nwould get amusement out of your embarrassing photos commensurate with your own\nembarrassment.\n\nThe whole point of a commitment device is to set up an automatic potential\npenalty that punishes you in some way. Just make sure that the amount of harm\ncaused to yourself is counterbalanced by a greater or equal amount of benefit\nto someone else, leaving the world no worse than you found it!\n\n## Footnotes\n\n[1] The idea originated, as far as we know, in 1984 in John Bear\u2019s The\nBlackmail Diet where the author describes his own commitment contract to lose\n70 pounds in a year or pay $5k to the American Nazi Party. Thanks to Daniel\nAkst\u2019s We Have Met the Enemy where we learned that and many other fascinating\nthings about the first world\u2019s ironically biggest problem, self-control.\n\n[2] Bethany points out that this is a clever trick for getting more bang for\nyour buck: it increases your utility for that amount of money if it is\notherwise going to benefit something horrible such as the Puppy Kicking\nSociety of North America. But at what cost?!\n\n[3] UPDATE: I\u2019m adding this footnote in 2020 because no one understands what I\nmean when I say \u201cliterally burning money isn\u2019t wasteful\u201d. It\u2019s admittedly\nconfusing. \u201cBurning money\u201d is used idiomatically to mean being maximally\nwasteful and destroying real value. But imagine you do a bunch of work for me\nand I pay you by writing down IOUs on pieces of paper and then the next day\nyou set fire to those pieces of paper. My reaction would be \u201cgosh, thank you\nfor obliterating my debt!\u201d. Burning government currency feels intuitively\ndifferent but it\u2019s really truly not. It\u2019s very weird and ironic for the\ngovernment to object to people burning their IOUs.\n\nI know half of you are still looking at me like I\u2019m hovering upside down and\nspeaking backwards, so here\u2019s another way to look at it. The money issuer (the\ngovernment or the fed or whatever) fully accounts for money getting lost or\naccidentally destroyed and they just print more to keep the total physical\nmoney supply at the right level. Not only is that very little skin off their\nnose \u2014 they can spend pennies printing stacks of hundred dollar bills \u2014 but\nthey can then actually spend those bills! (Or sell them to banks at face\nvalue, whatever.) Burning money is fundamentally the same as sending it to the\ngovernment. The actual waste \u2014 from a society-wide perspective \u2014 of literally\nburning money is just the quite low cost of replacing it.\n\nAnd I know some fraction of you now think I\u2019ve outlined a brazen free money\nconspiracy but that\u2019s a debate for elsewhere. How damaging, or how illegal,\nmoney-burning is is quite irrelevant to the point of this post, which is that\na threat of destroying value or otherwise harming the world as a commitment\ndevice is bad and unnecessary.\n\nTags:\n\n  * aherk\n  * akrasia\n  * bee-all\n  * best-of\n  * economics\n  * money\n  * rationality\n  * science\n  * stickk\n\nGitminder: Commit To Keep Coding Beeminding Outside the Box\n\n### About\n\nBeeminder is goal-tracking with teeth.
