Hannah Ross)\n\nProfessor Bennett-Levy said the trial would provide a \"stepped care\" model of\nrecovery, involving arts and nature-based group therapy, followed by MDMA-\nassisted therapy for people who needed it.\n\nMDMA is the active ingredient in the recreational drug ecstasy.\n\n\"It's not only about our community ... it's also about other Australian\ncommunities that are inevitably going to be, and are already, being affected\nby climate change,\" Professor Bennett-Levy said.\n\n\"Our aim here is to develop better ways to enable people to recover from the\ntrauma of climate-induced disasters.\"\n\nProfessor Bennett-Levy said the project was informed by research done by the\nUniversity Centre for Rural Health in Lismore after another major flood in\n2017, and by the National Disaster and Mental Health Wellbeing Framework\nreleased in 2023.\n\nHe said it was clear from the 2017 research that PTSD was compounded if people\nwere self-critical and blamed themselves, so the trial would focus on self-\ncompassion, aided by the clinical use of MDMA.\n\n\"Prior research has shown that MDMA-assisted therapy is an effective evidence-\nbased treatment for PTSD and enhances self-compassion,\" Professor Bennett-Levy\nsaid.\n\n## Thousands still traumatised\n\nResearchers estimate thousands of people in Lismore still suffer from PTSD\nfollowing the floods.\n\nResearchers say many people in Lismore are still affected by PTSD after the\n2022 floods.(ABC News: Matt Coble)\n\nLismore MP Janelle Saffin, who herself had to swim for her life through raging\nfloodwaters, said the city was well-placed to conduct the research, which\ncould assist other communities affected by natural disasters.\n\n\"If you were trapped in a roof with your children and had no way of getting\nout, it is normal to be traumatised,\" she said.\n\n\"They are some of the people we hope will be part of the trial.\n\n\"We had internally displaced people \u2014 it was a humanitarian disaster.\n\n\"This type of language we associate with events offshore ... but I have used\nthat language from day one to try to communicate how catastrophic it was [here\nin 2022].\"\n\nMs Saffin said she expected the research project would be a big part of the\nregion's recovery.\n\nProfessor James Bennett-Levy, Lismore MP Janelle Saffin and SCU vice\nchancellor Tyrone Carlin.(ABC North Coast: Hannah Ross)\n\n\"I can't stop smiling, even though there is trauma and we've all been through\nit,\" she said.\n\nSouthern Cross University vice chancellor Tyrone Carlin said the clinical\ntrial's broader relevance was particularly exciting.\n\n\"Isn't it wonderful to be able to be involved in work that is so relevant and\nimportant to us, but is so scalable and capable of being harnessed elsewhere?\"\n\nThe project will be assessed for its ethical standards before participants are\nselected by the end of the year.\n\n## ABC North Coast \u2014 local news in your inbox\n\nGet our local newsletter, delivered free each Friday\n\nYour information is being handled in accordance with the ABC Privacy\nCollection Statement.\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of\nService apply.\n\nPosted 7h ago7 hours agoFri 3 May 2024 at 8:19am\n\nShare\n\n  * Copy\n  * Facebook\n  * X (formerly Twitter)\n\n## Related Stories\n\n  * ### TGA approves psilocybin and MDMA for use in treating depression and PTSD\n\n  * ### Janelle thought her husband drowned, Robert lost his late wife's things \u2014 but these flood leaders keep turning up\n\n  * ### Free psychedelic therapy offered to first responders as biotech companies scramble to market\n\nMore on:\n\n  * Alternative Medicine\n  * Disaster and Emergency Response\n  * Floods\n  * Health\n  * Lismore\n  * Medical Research\n  * Post Traumatic Stress Disorder\n\n## ABC Emergency\n\nSearch any location in Australia to find nearby active incidents\n\nFind an incident\n\n### Plan for an emergency\n\n  * Plan for a Storm\n  * Plan for a Flood\n\n## Top Stories\n\n  * ### Bonza staff 'screaming and crying' after being told they won't be paid for April\n\n  * ### Missing surfers' burnt-out car found in Mexico\n\n  * ### Every year millions of Australians jet off overseas \u2014 so what happens if something goes wrong while a loved one is travelling?\n\n  * ### Prominent Gaza doctor dies in Israeli prison after four months of detention\n\n  * ### What's the unemployment rate in your region?
