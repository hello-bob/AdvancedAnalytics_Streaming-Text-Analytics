The New Testament is written in Greek; nearly\nall the Old Testament is written in Hebrew, while the Greek translation of the\nOld Testament (the LXX) is significant to biblical studies. Yet 268 verses of\nthe Bible were written in a language called Aramaic.\n\nThe portions of Scripture that were written in Aramaic include Ezra 4:8\u20136:18\nand 7:12-26 (67 verses), Daniel 2:4b\u20137:28 (200 verses), Jeremiah 10:11, and\nvarious proper names and isolated words and phrases scattered throughout the\nOld and New Testaments. Despite the fact that only a small percentage of\nScripture is written in this language, the Aramaic portion of the Bible is\ndisproportionately significant because of the importance of the book of Daniel\nto biblical prophecy. Aramaic is also important for New Testament studies, as\nseveral direct quotes from Jesus and others are preserved in the original\nAramaic that was spoken by Palestinian Jews of the Second Temple period. New\nTestament verses which include Aramaic words transliterated by Greek letters\nare: Matt 5:22; 27:46; Mark 5:41; 7:34; 10:51; 14:36; John 1:42; 20:16; Acts\n9:36, 40; Rom 8:15; 1 Cor 16:22; Gal 4:6.\n\nIn the Old Testament, four verses make a direct reference to the Aramaic\nlanguage: 2 Kings 18:26, Ezra 4:7, Isaiah 36:11, and Daniel 2:4. Each of these\nverses calls Aramaic \u201cAramaic\u201d (\u05d0\u05b2\u05e8\u05b8\u05de\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea, an adverbial form of \u05d0\u05b2\u05e8\u05b8\u05de\u05b4\u05d9),\nthough this used to be translated as \u201cSyrian\u201d or \u201cChaldee\u201d in English. Aramaic\nis called \u201cHebrew\u201d (\u1f19\u03b2\u03c1\u03b1\u0390\u03c2 or \u1f19\u03b2\u03c1\u03b1\u03ca\u03c3\u03c4\u03af) in the New Testament, since it was the\ntongue of the Hebrews (John 5:2; 19:13, 17, 20; 20:16; Acts 21:40; 22:2;\n26:14). Some newer translations render the Greek word for \u201cHebrew\u201d in these\nverses as \u201cAramaic,\u201d which recognizes that these verses refer to the language\nwe now call Aramaic.\n\nAramaic was originally the language of the Arameans, who were comprised of\ntribes that lived along the Euphrates River. Two of the most prominent of\nthese tribes were the Syrians to the northwest, and the Chaldeans to the\nsoutheast. The word Aramaic is derived from Aram, a son of Shem who was the\nprogenitor of the Arameans. In the earliest stages of the history of Aramaic,\nthe language was only spoken in Aramean locales, including the area where\nLaban lived (cf. Gen 31:47; Deut 26:5). However, as the Syrians and Chaldeans\ngained prominence in the ancient Near East, their tongue became established as\nan international language of commerce and diplomacy, gradually displacing\nAkkadian. Akkadian was still the official language of the Neo-Assyrian Empire,\nalthough 2 Kings 18:26 indicates that Aramaic was already becoming established\nas a lingua franca of the ancient Near East by 700 BC. When the Chaldeans\nsubsequently conquered Assyria, it was natural for them to use their own\nlanguage of Aramaic as the administrative language of the Neo-Babylonian\nEmpire, rather than adopting Akkadian. This is why Daniel 2:4 says the wise\nmen of Babylon addressed the king in Aramaic, and why the following section of\nthe book of Daniel is written in Aramaic. After the conquest of Babylon by\nPersia, the Persians also chose Aramaic as the official administrative\nlanguage of their vast empire. This is why the portions of Ezra which record\nofficial correspondence are written in Aramaic.\n\nAt the time when the books of Daniel and Ezra were written, most Jews could\nspeak and understand both Hebrew and Aramaic. They understood Hebrew as the\nlanguage spoken at home, among themselves, and in the reading of the\nScriptures, while Aramaic was the language spoken in broader society. Over\ntime, Aramaic replaced Hebrew as the primary language spoken by the Jews who\nlived in Palestine and regions to the east. The Jews had not learned Aramaic\nin Palestine (cf. 2 Kgs 18:26), but they had to learn it in exile, since it\nwas the language of their captors. Thus, the parts of the Old Testament which\nwere composed in Aramaic were written in that language as a result of the\nBabylonian captivity.\n\nBecause of this, Aramaic was the native tongue of our Lord; Hebrew was rarely\nused as a spoken language by Jews of the first century AD.[1] There are\nseveral places where the Gospel writers preserve quotations from Jesus in the\noriginal Aramaic, including His cry from the cross, Eloi, Eloi, lama\nsabacthani? (Mark 15:34). These words expressed Christ\u2019s deepest feelings at a\ntime of great personal anguish and emotion. That He spoke these words from\nPsalm 22:1 in Aramaic, rather than from the Hebrew original or the Greek\nSeptuagint translation, shows that Aramaic was the language that He knew most\nintimately. Thus, the New Testament preserves Aramaic words because Aramaic\nwas the mother tongue of Palestinian Jews in the first century AD.\n\nThe Greek of the New Testament was influenced by Aramaic, and so contains some\nAramaic idioms and forms of expression, such as the phrase \u201canswered and\nsaid.\u201d Although the degree of Aramaic influence on the Greek of the New\nTestament has been a subject of much debate, it is fair to say that the style\nof New Testament Greek is Semiticized to one degree or another. But it is not\ntrue that parts of the New Testament were originally written in Aramaic, as\nsome have claimed. No manuscript of any part of the New Testament has ever\nbeen discovered that is written in the Jewish Palestinian Aramaic dialect\nspoken by Jesus and the apostles.\n\nAfter the resurrection of Jesus, the Syriac dialect of Aramaic became the\nlanguage of the Syrian church. Aramaic also remained an important language for\nthe Jews. Because of this, there are two major Aramaic translations of the Old\nTestament, the Jewish Targums and the Syriac Peshitta. There are a number of\nimportant Syriac versions of the New Testament. Much of Jewish rabbinic\nliterature, and nearly all Syrian Christian literature, was written in\nAramaic. Some of the Dead Sea Scrolls were also written in Aramaic.\n\nBoth Aramaic and Hebrew are West Semitic languages. Thus, Aramaic and Hebrew\nshare many of the same linguistic characteristics and modes of expression.\nOverall, Hebrew grammar and morphology is somewhat closer to proto-Semitic,\nespecially in its patterns of vocalization, though Aramaic has a fuller\ncomplement of distinct verbal stems. Some distinctive characteristics of\nAramaic include the frequent use of the participle for a finite verb, the\nversatile particle \u05d3\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9, the use of a determined form instead of a prefixed\ndefinite article, and such idioms as \u201cson of man\u201d (for \u201cman\u201d) and \u201canswered\nand said\u201d (for \u201csaid\u201d). Because of the importance of Aramaic in the Second\nTemple period, Hebrew gradually began to be written in Aramaic letters during\nthat time, and Hebrew has used the Aramaic square script ever since.[2]\nHowever, Syriac and other dialects of Aramaic use different scripts, while the\nTargumim have a system of pointing that differs from the Masoretic pointing of\nthe Old Testament.\n\nOne of the peculiarities of Biblical Aramaic is that the divine name \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4\n(Yahweh) is never used. For some reason, this name was only used in Hebrew.\nHowever, the term \u05d0\u05b1\u05dc\u05b8\u05d4\u05bc \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05de\u05b7\u05d9\u05b8\u05bc\u05d0 (the God of heaven) occurs very frequently\nin Aramaic, much more than in Hebrew. It is also interesting that there are no\nOld Testament books written entirely in Aramaic. This is apparently to retain\nthe character of the Old Testament as a Hebrew text.\n\nBecause of the very long linguistic history of Aramaic, and the diverse number\nof groups that have spoken it, there are quite a variety of Aramaic dialects,\nof which Syriac is the most prominent. Some eighty percent of extant Aramaic\nwriting is in Syriac, a language which is still spoken today (in various\ndialects) and is used in the liturgy of some Eastern churches. There are also\ndistinct differences between different chronological periods of Aramaic.\nAlthough critical scholars have long attempted to deny it, the Aramaic of both\nDaniel and Ezra is of the Imperial Aramaic dialect that was in use in the\nsixth and fifth centuries BC. It is noticeably different from both the Aramaic\nof Qumran and first-century AD Jewish Palestinian Aramaic.\n\nWhile Hebrew was used sparingly outside of the Bible and the nation of Israel,\nAramaic was used very broadly. There is a huge corpus of Aramaic literature.\nFrom about 600 BC until AD 700, Aramaic was the primary trade language of the\nancient Near East. It was also the primary spoken language of Palestine,\nSyria, and Mesopotamia at the time of Christ. Aramaic was only displaced by\nArabic when the Muslims conquered the Middle East\u2014though the language never\ndied out completely, and is still spoken in pockets of Syria, Iraq, Iran,\nTurkey, and diaspora communities worldwide. Aramaic is possibly the language\nwith the longest continuous written record in the world. Because of the broad\nuse of Aramaic outside of the Bible, there is rarely any doubt about the\nmeaning of words or constructions in Biblical Aramaic, as there are many\nopportunities to research the language in extrabiblical literature.\n\nAlthough there is only a limited amount of biblical material composed in\nAramaic, the influence of the Aramaic language is felt throughout the Old and\nNew Testaments, as it was present in the background from Genesis until\nRevelation. Aramaic also held a prominent place in the early church and in\npostbiblical Judaism. But insofar as it is directly used in the Bible, Aramaic\nis the language of the captivity and of the Redeemer.\n\nPostscript: Aramaic is a much more cross-disciplinary language than Greek or\nHebrew. It is highly relevant to OT studies, NT studies, intertestamental\nstudies, Jewish studies, Patristics, historical theology, archaeology,\nSemitics, ancient Near Eastern history, and Middle Eastern studies. As a\nbridge between diverse fields of study, and the original language of important\nparts of the Old Testament, Aramaic is a very useful language to know. For\nrecommended resources for the study of Biblical Aramaic, see this post.\n\nEnjoy this content?

However, first-century AD inscriptions in Palestine are almost\nexclusively in Aramaic (or Greek), and Aramaic is consistently used by Jesus,\nrather than Hebrew. Jesus probably understood Hebrew, but as a literary,\nrather than spoken, language. He would have known Greek as well and spoke it\non some occasions (as when dealing with Gentiles), but He would have been more\nat home in Aramaic.\n\n[2] The Aramaic square script is also called the \u201cJewish script,\u201d the \u201csquare\nscript,\u201d or the \u201cAssyrian script.\u201d Three stages in the development of this\nscript at Qumran are called the \u201carchaic script\u201d (250-150 BC), the \u201cHasmonean\nscript\u201d (150-30 BC), and the \u201cHerodian script\u201d (30 BC \u2013 70 AD). Despite the\nprevalence of the square script in Hebrew writing, twelve Qumran fragments\nwere found written in a paleo-Hebrew script similar to the original Hebrew\nscript in which most of the Old Testament was written, while several other\nQumran manuscripts used the square script for the main body text and the\npaleo-Hebrew script for nomina sacra.

Tov, Textual Criticism of the\nHebrew Bible (3rd ed.; Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2012), 206-7.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to print (Opens in new window)\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nLanguage learning: a key to deeper Bible studyNovember 1, 2015In \"Biblical\nlanguages\"\n\nResources for Biblical AramaicSeptember 29, 2018In \"Bible scholarship\"\n\nWhy was the Old Testament written in Hebrew?November 7, 2015In \"Biblical\nlanguages\"\n\n### 39 thoughts on \u201cAramaic: The Bible\u2019s third language\u201d\n\n  1.

Antonia Potter said:\n\nOctober 20, 2019 at 4:50 pm\n\nThank you for all of this information, which is just amazing to learn and to\nread about! Why, do you think, were not the scriptures written in Aramaic\nduring the time periods when this was the language spoken in Israel and even\nin trade? I understand why the epistles would be written in Greek \u2013 for the\nGospel was being shared with \u201cthe Greeks\u201d. But why would the O.T. scriptures\nnot be written in what was then the vernacular, and also, Jesus\u2019 words?\n\nIt\u2019s rather sad to read what Jesus said in a translation of a translation of\nthe original...When we do word studies on His sayings, I would love to know\nthat the words being explored were the very ones used by Our Lord. It just\nmakes me feel sad to know that we\u2019re not authentically studying the Bible in a\ntranslation that was made directly from the original.\n\nAlso, we say: \u201cThe Bible is infallible in the original languages\u201d, not \u201cin the\nKJV\u201d (although some do say this!), nor \u201cin the NASB\u201d nor \u201cin the NIV\u201d.\nHowever, it turns out now that the Bible cannot be said to be infallible in\nthe Greek FROM WHICH are derived our English translations! (At least, when it\nquotes Jesus and anyone else speaking in Aramaic during His lifetime.) There\nare 4 words for \u201clove\u201d in Greek, and 5 words for \u201csin\u201d. How do we know for\ncertain that the writers in Greek always chose the exactly perfect word in the\nGreek to translate what Jesus, Herod, and others spoke in Aramaic? I guess\nbecause God moved upon the men to write and guided their writing? Some of the\ndisciples were uneducated fishermen. How did they come to be able to write\nprecisely in Greek? Did someone assist them in writing it down?\n\nSo many questions arise as I ponder this process. I would be so interested in\nyour thoughts, Dr. Anderson! Many thanks, once again, for providing this\nvaluable information above for all of us!\n\nReply\n\n     * Steven Anderson said:\n\nOctober 23, 2019 at 7:57 pm\n\nHi, Antonia! Here are a few responses to your questions.\n\nThe last books of the Old Testament were written at a time of linguistic\ntransition, when both Hebrew and Aramaic were understood by most Jews in\nIsrael/Judah. Thus, while either language could have been used, Hebrew was\ngenerally preferred as the traditional national language.\n\nSome scholars have attempted to do word studies based on what they think were\nthe Aramaic words behind the Greek words used in the Gospels, but these\nstudies are too conjectural. We know that Jesus spoke Greek as well as\nAramaic, but the Gospels normally do not state which language he was speaking\non a particular occasion. Since the inspired text that we have is in Greek, it\nis best to just do exegesis from the Greek text, with an awareness of Aramaic\ninfluence or background. As an inspired text, the Greek Gospels are the Word\nof the Lord, even if they may be recorded in a different language (at times)\nthan what speakers in the narrative originally used. The black letters of the\nBible are no less the Word of God than the black letters; thus, the inspired\nwords are the ones that are written. The Old Testament contains similar\ninstances of translated dialogue, such as in Genesis 42:23.\n\nJews living in Israel/Palestine in the first century AD would have understood\nboth Aramaic and Greek, although most were more proficient in Aramaic. Some of\nthe uneducated disciples, such as Peter and John, certainly had help in\nwriting their epistles. In John\u2019s case, he did not have help when he wrote\nRevelation, since he was alone when he saw that vision. Thus, Revelation has a\ncompletely unique style of Greek in comparison with any other work of Greek\nliterature, and it contains many grammatical irregularities. It is interesting\nthat two of the NT epistles with the highest literary Greek, James and Jude,\nwere written by brothers of Jesus.\n\nReply\n\n  7. mark said:\n\nNovember 6, 2019 at 3:27 pm\n\nCould you answer the following questions? How rich in vocabulary was Aramaic\nlanguage as Jesus spoke in comparison to Greek or later Latin? Could there be\na relationship between the limited vocabulary of the common people and the\nneed to use parables, idioms and hyperbole to paint pictures of ideas for\nwhich no words existed in that language?\n\nReply\n\n     * Steven Anderson said:\n\nNovember 6, 2019 at 4:05 pm\n\nThe Aramaic that Jesus spoke did not have as many technical terms as Greek or\nLatin. However, translation from Greek to Aramaic was possible, as\ndemonstrated by the Syriac translations of the New Testament. Thus, I think\nJesus\u2019 use of parables may be viewed as a general pedagogical device, rather\nthan something that was required by the nature of the Aramaic language.\n\nReply\n\n     * Anya said:\n\nJuly 25, 2022 at 4:10 am\n\nThis language is still spoken in modern day, btw. By Chaldeans in and from\nIraq .

Otherwise, one would have to conclude that emoticons or\nother texting slang is a rich language merely because millions of people\nworldwide use it every day.\n\nThe richness of a language has much more to do with hermeneutics and lexicon\nthan with demographics.\n\n       * Anya said:\n\nJuly 26, 2022 at 4:24 pm\n\nTo Inaki Viggers, from my experience I wouldn\u2019t compare Aramaic language to\n\u201cemoticons\u201d . I\u2019d be offended if I was Chaldean. And I\u2019d have to add that I\nbelieve Aramaic is richer than English.\n\n       * I\u00f1aki Viggers said:\n\nJuly 26, 2022 at 6:26 pm\n\nNobody is comparing Aramaic to emoticons. My mention of emoticons only\nillustrates what is flawed about the rationale that concludes with \u201cSo yes,\nAramaic is rich language\u201d. The fact that Aramaic (or any language) remains\nalive is largely irrelevant for assessing its richness.\n\n  8. karma said:\n\nNovember 11, 2019 at 11:58 pm\n\nHi Steven, thank you for your article.\n\nI\u2019m neither a Bible scholar nor a person who has a specific religion. I landed\nto your page from the Google search result as I would like to know when was\nthe OT Aramaic Peshitta translated.\n\nYou wrote : \u201cHe spoke these words from Psalm 22:1 in Aramaic, rather than from\nthe Hebrew original or the Greek Septuagint translation\u201d.\n\nFrom your sentence above, I conclude that it seems before Jesus was born,\nthere were three version OT language \u2014> the original Hebrew, the Greek\n(Septuagint) translation and the Aramaic (Peshitta) translation.\n\nFrom the internet, it seems the time when the Aramaic OT translated has a\nvarious opinion. Some just say (A) it is unknown, some say it\u2019s probably (B)\nin the late first century AD, other say it\u2019s probably (C) in the second\ncentury AD and some say that (D) the Aramaic OT translation was already there\nbefore Jesus was born.\n\nI\u2019m interested in D, but I can\u2019t find a satisfying result after Google search.\nMaybe there are in a form of E-book, but one have to buy it :).

The evidence\nwas reviewed in detail by Dirksen*, Mikra, 295 and Weitzman* 1992. Dirksen\nconcluded that \u201cno decisive arguments for either Christian or Jewish\nauthorship have been advanced.\u201d Since the individual books of S derived from\ndifferent circles, it nevertheless should be concluded that the Jewish element\nis clearly visible, be it Jewish-Rabbinic as claimed by Maori* or Jewish-non-\nRabbinic as claimed by Weitzman* 1999, 239\u201340 and ter Haar Romeny*.\n\nThe oldest dated manuscript of S is the MS London, British Library, Add.\n14,512, written in 459\u201360.\n\nReply\n\n       * Steven Anderson said:\n\nNovember 12, 2019 at 12:16 am\n\nHere is a quote from Ellis R. Brotzman and Eric J. Tully, Old Testament\nTextual Criticism: A Practical Introduction, Second Edition. (Grand Rapids,\nMI: Baker Academic: A Division of Baker Publishing Group, 2016), 83.\n\nWe do not know the exact date or circumstances of the translation. The OT must\nhave been translated before the fourth century, when the Syriac church fathers\nAphrahat and Ephrem quote from it. Most scholars place it in the first or\nsecond century CE. Internal evidence suggests that the translators were\nsomehow connected to both Judaism and Christianity. The translation was made\nfrom Hebrew and sometimes reflects Jewish exegetical traditions. This suggests\nthat the translators were Jewish since it would be very unusual for non-Jews\nto know Hebrew. On the other hand, the Peshitta was used and transmitted in\nthe Christian church, and it appears to be uninterested in rabbinic dietary\nlaws and other Jewish theological emphases. Therefore, Michael Weitzman has\nargued that it was created by nonrabbinic Jews who converted to Christianity.\n\n       * Mark Vanderveen said:\n\nSeptember 20, 2021 at 2:43 am\n\nScholars seem to agree that Jesus was trilingual \u2014 Hebrew, Greek and Aramaic \u2014\nbut that he and his disciples conversed almost exclusively in Aramaic. I\nunderstand there are no extant copies of the New Testament in Aramaic, but\nthat does not mean such copies never existed. Most scholars think (educated\nguess) the New Testament was written primarily in Greek. Other scholars\nmaintain that the New Testament was written in Aramaic and later translated\ninto Greek. They point to archaic names (the city of Ptolomei being referred\nto as Acu), awkward grammar and syntax, and the use of certain phrases. Isn\u2019t\nit fair to say that no one knows for certain. That highly educated multi-\nlingual biblical scholars are making their best guess based on incomplete\ninformation?\n\n       * Steven Anderson said:\n\nSeptember 26, 2021 at 4:34 pm\n\nNearly all evangelical New Testament scholars believe that the New Testament\nwas written entirely in Greek, and this is not just an educated guess. As you\nmentioned, there are no copies of a \u201clost Aramaic original\u201d of any book of the\nNew Testament. The lack of manuscripts is no small problem, as the church\nbegan in Aramaic-speaking parts of the Roman Empire, so the churches in those\nparts would almost certainly have preserved the Aramaic originals. There is an\nearly Syriac translation of the New Testament, but it is clearly a translation\nof the Greek. Of course, there would be no need to make an Aramaic translation\nof the New Testament if it was originally written in Aramaic. The New\nTestament book that is most often suggested to have originally been written in\nAramaic is Matthew, based on references in the church fathers. However, many\nlinguistic studies have demonstrated that Matthew\u2019s Gospel cannot be a\ntranslation of an Aramaic document, not even of an Aramaic original that has\nnot yet been discovered. The thoroughgoing use of Greek idioms and style and\nMatthew\u2019s quotations from the Septuagint (especially 12:21; 13:14-15; 15:8-9)\nall point convincingly to a Greek original. The theory of a lost Aramaic\noriginal of parts or all of the New Testament also creates a theological\nproblem. It would mean that the Greek text we have today is not the original\ninspired text, and therefore may be unreliable and contain mistranslations or\nhistorically suspect redactional material. At a minimum, the precise nuances\nof the original Aramaic could not be known. However, the linguistic and\nmanuscript evidence overwhelmingly supports the authenticity of the Greek text\nas the original text of the New Testament.\n\n  9. Steven Anderson said:\n\nNovember 12, 2019 at 12:17 am\n\nHowever, the Aramaic Targums certainly had pre-Christian oral roots, and this\nwas the form of Aramaic spoken by Jesus (not Syriac).\n\nReply\n\n  10. Sheri said:\n\nAugust 5, 2020 at 6:09 am\n\nI am so fascinated by this and really want to learn more. Unfortunately, I am\nstill somewhat confused and not sure how to determine which Aramaic dialect\nJesus spoke. I am wanting to search specific words used (enunciation and\nwritten language) by our Lord, but not sure how to proceed. Thank you, Sheri\n\nReply\n\n     * Steven Anderson said:\n\nAugust 5, 2020 at 8:25 am\n\nJesus spoke Jewish Palestinian Aramaic. There is a Grammar of Palestinian\nJewish Aramaic by William Baron Stevenson that is available for free online at\nArchive.org or as a hard copy reprint by various publishers, such as Wipf and\nStock, or with modern revisions in Accordance Bible Software. The\nComprehensive Aramaic Lexicon is a great free resource for finding Aramaic\nwords; look for the \u201cJud\u201d or \u201cJPAEpig\u201d labels for word usage in Jewish\nPalestinian Aramaic. For less technical answers about grammar, vocabulary, and\npronunciation, the Jesus Spoke Aramaic website offers lessons and coaching.\n\nReply\n\n       * blossomnt said:\n\nNovember 3, 2023 at 4:42 am\n\nDear Steven, Thank you so much for this insight. I speak Aramaic, as it is my\nmothers tongue. I grew up in the Netherlands as a Christian, but my\ninternational career did not give me much time to deepen my knowledge of the\nbible and Jesus Christ my lord. I am in London now and started to take time to\nfocus the next chapter of my life on this. I signed up to a few biblestudies\nto become a true Christen en grow closer to Jesus. I was just checking online\nto see if there are bibles written in the original language to buy, instead of\nNLT/ ESV / Archaeology study bible which I have. While I do speak Aramaic I\ncannot read it well. My siisters can though. But I thought to learn it. You\nhave helped me grately by given me options to get started. So thank you for\nthis and keep up the great work!\n\n       * Steven Anderson said:\n\nNovember 3, 2023 at 10:41 am\n\nHi,\n\nIt\u2019s great to hear your story and that you found my articles useful. There are\nmany of us Bible scholars who wish we could speak Aramaic like you do! I\nassume you have seen my post on Resources for Biblical Aramaic:\nhttps://truthonlybible.com/2018/09/29/resources-for-biblical-aramaic/\n\nSince you asked about editions of the Bible in the original languages, I will\nlist a few printed editions of the Hebrew/Aramaic Old Testament and the Greek\nNew Testament: Tyndale House Greek New Testament\n(https://www.amazon.com/Testament-Produced-Tyndale-Cambridge-\nTruTone/dp/1433558564/) Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia\n(https://www.christianbook.com/biblia-hebraica-stuttgartensia-wide-margin-\nedition/9781598561999/pd/561999) Biblia Hebraica Leningradensia\n(https://www.christianbook.com/biblia-hebraica-\nleningradensia/9781619705371/pd/705371)\n\nFor reading the Bible in Aramaic, you would want to purchase an edition of the\nPeshitta. The Peshitta is an ancient Syriac translation of the Bible that\ndoesn\u2019t always follow the best Greek manuscripts, but it is the traditional\ntext used by Aramaic Christian communities. A useful printed Syriac-English\nNew Testament is the one published by Gorgias Press,\nhttps://www.gorgiaspress.com/syriac-english-new-testament-gilded\n\nFor a book that has the sections of the Bible originally written in Aramaic, I\nrecommend Biblical Aramaic: A Reader and Handbook:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/1619708914/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ep_dp_nuZNBb34X8CBV\n\nThere are also electronic resources available for both reading Syriac and the\noriginal languages. STEP Bible is a popular free resource.\nhttps://www.stepbible.org/?q=version=ESV|version=Pesh|reference=John.1&options=NVUGH&display=INTERLEAVED\n\nFinally, for general Bible study, my Interpretive Guide to the Bible is\navailable as free pdf downloads or print books. I am hoping to publish a\nrevision of the third volume this year.\nhttps://www.bible.truthonly.com/publications\n\nI am also writing a commentary on Revelation and can send you a private link\nto the draft chapters if you are interested.\n\nGod bless,\n\nSteven\n\n       * Steven Anderson said:\n\nNovember 3, 2023 at 12:03 pm\n\nWith regard to the STEP Bible, here are a couple of additional links. Here is\nJohn 1:1 with a tagged ASV text in parallel with the tagged Tyndale House\nGreek New Testament, the Syriac Peshitta text, and James Murdock\u2019s translation\nof the Syriac Peshitta.\nhttps://www.stepbible.org/?q=version=ASV|version=THGNT|version=Pesh|version=Murd|reference=John.1&options=GNVUH&display=INTERLEAVED\nHere is Daniel 7:1 with the tagged ASV text in parallel with the tagged\nAramaic text\nhttps://www.stepbible.org/?q=version=ASV|version=OHB|reference=Dan.7&options=HNVGU\n\n  11.

Enjoyed it.\n\nI have a couple of questions that you may be able to help me with.\n\n#1. I had read (I think I have the book somewhere in my bookcase) that the\nHebrew language was almost a dead language that had revived. That this is the\nonly language that has come back from the brink of death like this. Is this\ntrue?\n\n#2. Do you know anything about jussives in Hebrew? I am studying and teaching\non the book of Job. 3 commentaries and 1 study bible state that the verbs in\nJob 24:18 \u2013 24 can be read jussives. Is there anyway to confirm this? If so,\ndo you know where I can get or read this information online?\n\nAny and all help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. God Bless.\n\nReply\n\n     * Steven Anderson said:\n\nSeptember 28, 2021 at 5:37 pm\n\nHi Douglas!\n\nThere have been some other languages on the brink of death that have been\nrevived, such as some of the indigenous languages of the Americas. However, I\nbelieve Hebrew is the only language that ceased to be used in regular daily\nspeech for more than a thousand years that was later revived on a large scale.\n\nA good place to ask your question about jussives is the Biblical Language\nMajors Facebook group (https://www.facebook.com/groups/224415954327748). You\nshould get some detailed responses from guys who can explain the significance\nof Hebrew jussives and whether it is grammatically or exegetically possible to\nread the verbs in Job 24:18-24 that way.\n\nReply\n\n       * Douglas Collins said:\n\nSeptember 30, 2021 at 10:53 am\n\nThank you for the information. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have a facebook account,\nso that won\u2019t help me. I have found out that the NKJV translates the verbs as\njussives, so maybe there is something to this after all (at the moment, I\ncan\u2019t find any other versions that translate it that way). Anyway, again, I\nthank you for the info. God Bless.\n\n  13. I\u00f1aki Viggers said:\n\nFebruary 5, 2022 at 4:39 pm\n\nThanks for this interesting article. I would likewise be interested in hearing\nyour thoughts on the following issue.\n\nSome of the theories the Zohar advances in regard to the creation are premised\non visual features of the Aramaic square script, and impliedly the Ktav\nAshuri. Some of these features are not even present in the paleo-Hebrew\nalphabet. See for instance Haqdamat 1:3a (in reference to zain), and arguably\n1:2b (tzadi).\n\nIt seems to me that the Jews\u2019 belatedness of adopting the square script\ndebunks the archetypal value that the Zohar and related sources attribute to\nthe Hebrew alphabet. To some extent this is akin to interpreting Mayan\ntheosophy on the basis of the shape of characters of the Roman alphabet\ndespite the fact that Mayans ended up adopting their conquerors\u2019 alphabet for\nstrictly historical reasons.\n\nReply\n\n     * Steven Anderson said:\n\nFebruary 12, 2022 at 11:44 am\n\nYes, I agree. Those sorts of theories are just the speculations of clever\nrabbis, with no historical basis or exegetical basis in the text of Scripture.\n\nReply\n\n       * Steven Anderson said:\n\nFebruary 12, 2022 at 11:55 am\n\nOne of the major governing hermeneutical principles used by the Rabbis was\nomnisignificance, which means that even the slightest detail in the biblical\ntext has a divinely inspired meaning. That would include the shapes of the\nletters. Of course, these interpretations go far beyond, and sometimes\ncontradict, the literal meaning of the biblical text.\n\n  14.

Clifford Harbinson said:\n\nFebruary 9, 2023 at 12:01 pm\n\nCiao Steven, hopefully you can help me with a dilemma. Have you any idea why\nthe authors left some words/terms in Aramaic? Most appear to have the\ntranslations or interpretations added. My question refers to Jesus\u2019 prayer in\nGethsamane, \u201cAbba, Father\u201d. Is \u201cFather\u201d a translation of Abba or did Jesus\npray \u201cFather, my Father\u201d (Aba, Abi). If the answer is the latter, why was\n\u201cAbba\u201d transliterated in Greek?\n\nReply\n\n     * Steven Anderson said:\n\nMarch 3, 2023 at 8:44 pm\n\nProbably all of Jesus\u2019 prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane was in Aramaic, but\nsince the Gospels were written in Greek, they give a Greek translation of the\nprayer. It is interesting that Mark 14:36 preserves one Aramaic word from this\nprayer, \u201cAbba\u201d (\u05d0\u05b7\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05d0), which Mark translates as \u201cFather\u201d (\u1f41 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1). This\nterm was familiar to many of Mark\u2019s readers, and would have been of special\ninterest to them, as it was the term of intimate familiarity that Aramaic\nspeakers used to address their fathers. The use of this term by Jesus\nindicates that He is God\u2019s Son.\n\nIn general, many Aramaic terms are preserved in the New Testament because they\ncommunicated a special significance to the original readers.\n\nReply\n\n  16. Jon Engles said:\n\nOctober 31, 2023 at 11:38 am\n\nI found this article while I was trying to learn more about bible translations\nand transliterations. I was taught that God preserved what God preserved. IF\nGod wanted a copy of the bible in Aramaic then there would be.\n\nIn my humble opinion, using text vernacular, if God flooded the earth, kept\nIsrael a people in the midst of enemies, and rose Christ from the dead then He\ncan do anything He wants. He wrote the physical laws of the universe; He can\ndo whatever He wants.\n\nIf God wants/needs something (I believe that He does what He does as a way to\nshow us His love for us) He does it. Clay has no right to tell the potter what\nto make; in this particular example the clay cannot even speak.\n\nThat brings me to my final example: God is Omniscient; He knows and does\nanything according to His Will, His good and perfect Will. As believers we all\ncome to the realization that He is in control whether we choose His team or\nnot. we conform to Him, not the other way around.\n\nMy seminary prof always used to say, \u201cWhat does the text say?\u201d The apostle\nPaul said that the word of God is sharper than a double edged sword, able to\nsplit between the bone and the marrow. God preserved what He wanted to\npreserve.\n\nThe idea of the whole Bible points to Jesus and His sacrificial death for us.\nThat is why we believe in this \u201cBook.\u201d By reading the Bible in Greek, Hebrew,\nAramaic the message is still proclaimed.\n\nSalvation is free for all who ask; salvation is accepting that I am not God\nand I know who is. He died for me and He rose again. The apostle Paul also\nsaid, \u201cI preached Christ, and Christ crucified.\u201d We don\u2019t need anything more\nthan that.\n\nReply\n\n  17.
