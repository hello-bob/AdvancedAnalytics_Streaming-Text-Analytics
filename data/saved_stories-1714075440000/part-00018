The OpenBao\ncommunity intends to provide this software under an OSI-approved open-source\nlicense, led by a community run under open governance principles.\n\nA modern system requires access to a multitude of secrets: database\ncredentials, API keys for external services, credentials for service-oriented\narchitecture communication, etc. Understanding who is accessing what secrets\nis already very difficult and platform-specific. Adding on key rolling, secure\nstorage, and detailed audit logs is almost impossible without a custom\nsolution. This is where OpenBao steps in.\n\nThe key features of OpenBao are:\n\n  * Secure Secret Storage: Arbitrary key/value secrets can be stored in OpenBao. OpenBao encrypts these secrets prior to writing them to persistent storage, so gaining access to the raw storage isn't enough to access your secrets. OpenBao can write to disk, Consul, and more.\n\n  * Dynamic Secrets: OpenBao can generate secrets on-demand for some systems, such as AWS or SQL databases. For example, when an application needs to access an S3 bucket, it asks OpenBao for credentials, and OpenBao will generate an AWS keypair with valid permissions on demand. After creating these dynamic secrets, OpenBao will also automatically revoke them after the lease is up.\n\n  * Data Encryption: OpenBao can encrypt and decrypt data without storing it. This allows security teams to define encryption parameters and developers to store encrypted data in a location such as a SQL database without having to design their own encryption methods.\n\n  * Leasing and Renewal: All secrets in OpenBao have a lease associated with them. At the end of the lease, OpenBao will automatically revoke that secret. Clients are able to renew leases via built-in renew APIs.\n\n  * Revocation: OpenBao has built-in support for secret revocation. OpenBao can revoke not only single secrets, but a tree of secrets, for example, all secrets read by a specific user, or all secrets of a particular type. Revocation assists in key rolling as well as locking down systems in the case of an intrusion.\n\n## Documentation, Getting Started, and Certification Exams\n\n## Developing OpenBao\n\nIf you wish to work on OpenBao itself or any of its built-in systems, you'll\nfirst need Go installed on your machine.\n\nFor local dev first make sure Go is properly installed, including setting up a\nGOPATH. Ensure that $GOPATH/bin is in your path as some distributions bundle\nthe old version of build tools. Next, clone this repository. OpenBao uses Go\nModules, so it is recommended that you clone the repository outside of the\nGOPATH. You can then download any required build tools by bootstrapping your\nenvironment:\n\n    \n    \n    $ make bootstrap ...\n\nTo compile a development version of OpenBao, run make or make dev. This will\nput the OpenBao binary in the bin and $GOPATH/bin folders:\n\n    \n    \n    $ make dev ... $ bin/bao ...\n\nTo compile a development version of OpenBao with the UI, run make static-dist\ndev-ui. This will put the OpenBao binary in the bin and $GOPATH/bin folders:\n\n    \n    \n    $ make static-dist dev-ui ... $ bin/bao ...\n\nTo run tests, type make test. Note: this requires Docker to be installed. If\nthis exits with exit status 0, then everything is working!\n\n    \n    \n    $ make test ...\n\nIf you're developing a specific package, you can run tests for just that\npackage by specifying the TEST variable. For example below, only vault package\ntests will be run.\n\n    \n    \n    $ make test TEST=./vault ...\n\n### Importing OpenBao\n\nThis repository publishes two libraries that may be imported by other\nprojects: github.com/openbao/openbao/api and github.com/openbao/openbao/sdk.\n\nNote that this repository also contains OpenBao (the product), and as with\nmost Go projects, OpenBao uses Go modules to manage its dependencies. The\nmechanism to do that is the go.mod file. As it happens, the presence of that\nfile also makes it theoretically possible to import OpenBao as a dependency\ninto other projects. Some other projects have made a practice of doing so in\norder to take advantage of testing tooling that was developed for testing\nOpenBao itself. This is not, and has never been, a supported way to use the\nOpenBao project. We aren't likely to fix bugs relating to failure to import\ngithub.com/openbao/openbao into your project.\n\nSee also the section \"Docker-based tests\" below.\n\n### Acceptance Tests\n\nOpenBao has comprehensive acceptance tests covering most of the features of\nthe secret and auth methods.\n\nIf you're working on a feature of a secret or auth method and want to verify\nit is functioning (and also hasn't broken anything else), we recommend running\nthe acceptance tests.\n\nWarning: The acceptance tests create/destroy/modify real resources, which may\nincur real costs in some cases. In the presence of a bug, it is technically\npossible that broken backends could leave dangling data behind. Therefore,\nplease run the acceptance tests at your own risk. At the very least, we\nrecommend running them in their own private account for whatever backend\nyou're testing.\n\nTo run the acceptance tests, invoke make testacc:\n\n    \n    \n    $ make testacc TEST=./builtin/logical/consul ...\n\nThe TEST variable is required, and you should specify the folder where the\nbackend is. The TESTARGS variable is recommended to filter down to a specific\nresource to test, since testing all of them at once can sometimes take a very\nlong time.\n\nAcceptance tests typically require other environment variables to be set for\nthings such as access keys. The test itself should error early and tell you\nwhat to set, so it is not documented here.\n\n### Docker-based Tests\n\nWe have created an experimental new testing mechanism inspired by\nNewTestCluster. An example of how to use it:\n\n    \n    \n    import ( \"testing\" \"github.com/openbao/openbao/sdk/helper/testcluster/docker\" ) func Test_Something_With_Docker(t *testing.T) { opts := &docker.DockerClusterOptions{ ImageRepo: \"openbao/openbao\", ImageTag: \"latest\", } cluster := docker.NewTestDockerCluster(t, opts) defer cluster.Cleanup() client := cluster.Nodes()[0].APIClient() _, err := client.Logical().Read(\"sys/storage/raft/configuration\") if err != nil { t.Fatal(err) } }\n\nHere is a more realistic example of how we use it in practice. DefaultOptions\nuses hashicorp/vault:latest as the repo and tag, but it also looks at the\nenvironment variable OPENBAO_BINARY. If populated, it will copy the local file\nreferenced by OPENBAO_BINARY into the container. This is useful when testing\nlocal changes.\n\nOptionally you can set COMMIT_SHA, which will be appended to the image name we\nbuild as a debugging convenience.\n\n    \n    \n    func Test_Custom_Build_With_Docker(t *testing.T) { opts := docker.DefaultOptions(t) cluster := docker.NewTestDockerCluster(t, opts) defer cluster.Cleanup() }\n\nFinally, here's an example of running an existing OSS docker test with a\ncustom binary:\n\n    \n    \n    $ GOOS=linux make dev $ VAULT_BINARY=$(pwd)/bin/bao go test -run 'TestRaft_Configuration_Docker' ./vault/external_tests/raft/raft_binary ok github.com/openbao/openbao/vault/external_tests/raft/raft_binary 20.960s\n\n## About\n\nOpenBao exists to provide a software solution to manage, store, and distribute\nsensitive data including secrets, certificates, and keys.\n\nopenbao.org/\n\n### Topics\n\ngo security secret-management\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\n### License\n\nMPL-2.0 license\n\n### Code of conduct\n\nCode of conduct\n\nActivity\n\nCustom properties\n\n### Stars\n\n1.9k stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n38 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n62 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\n101 tags\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Contributors 1,262\n\n\\+ 1,248 contributors\n\n## Languages\n\n  * Go 66.0%\n  * JavaScript 15.4%\n  * MDX 12.2%\n  * Handlebars 4.2%\n  * SCSS 0.7%\n  * Shell 0.5%\n  * Other 1.0%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
