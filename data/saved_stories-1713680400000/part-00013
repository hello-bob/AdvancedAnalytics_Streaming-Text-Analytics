Today, when solar sailing\nis operational, people often assume the solar wind drives solar sails, when in\nfact the operating principle for solar sails is the momentum generated by\nphotons, which are themselves massless. But streaming particles are indeed a\nkind of \u2018wind,\u2019 and there are magnetic sail concepts tailored for them too.\n\nAs always, we have to be careful about terminology, especially given the\nsignificance of the solar wind in defining our Solar System\u2019s environment.\nSolar transients likewise have to be considered, because in addition to solar\nflares, we have to factor in coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and the particles\naccelerated by both of these. All of this as well as the interplanetary\nmagnetic field shapes our star\u2019s interactions with the local interstellar\nmedium, creating the plasma envelope called the heliosphere. Only the Voyager\nspacecraft have returned data from the LISM, and they\u2019re not very far into it.\n\nWe\u2019ve looked at the Interstellar Probe concept in these pages before. The\nresult of countless hours and numerous contributors at the Johns Hopkins\nApplied Physics Laboratory and elsewhere, the study was created for the Solar\nand Space Physics Decadal Survey and extensively analyzes everything from the\nlaunch vehicle to instrumentation for a mission that would exit the\nheliosphere and reach as far as hundreds of AUs within 50 years. Given that\nour knowledge of the realm beyond the heliosphere is almost entirely the\nresult of remote sensing and indirect measurements, having an actual\nspacecraft on the scene would take us far beyond our modeling.\n\nImage: The SWAP instrument aboard New Horizons has confirmed that the solar\nwind slows as it travels farther from the Sun. This schematic of the\nheliosphere shows that the solar wind begins slowing at approximately 4 AU\nradial distance from the Sun and continues to slow as it moves toward the\nouter solar system and picks up interstellar material. Current extrapolations\nreveal the termination shock may currently be closer than found by the Voyager\nspacecraft. However, increasing solar activity will soon expand the\nheliosphere and push the termination shock farther out, possibly to the 84-94\nAU range encountered by the Voyager spacecraft.

We have data\nfrom the IBEX satellite (Interstellar Boundary Explorer) covering an entire\nsolar cycle from 2009 through 2019. Although it\u2019s in Earth orbit, IBEX detects\nenergetic neutral atoms (ENAs) from the outer regions of the heliosphere, the\nzone where solar wind particles begin to collide with those of the even less\nunderstood interstellar wind. We are in essence mapping a region by sending a\nsignal \u2013 actually using the Sun\u2019s \u2018signal,\u2019 the particles of the solar wind \u2013\ndeep into the edge of the system and trying to make sense out of the return\nechoes. The IMAP (Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe), set for launch\nin 2025, will further examine this region from its own vantage at the L1\nLagrange point.\n\nWe can draw a lot of conclusions from the data from such missions, but not\nenough. Sarah Spitzer (University of Michigan), lead author of a paper on a\njust released study that analyzes how best to exit the heliosphere, notes the\nsignificance of the JHU/APL work: \u201cWithout such a mission, we are like\ngoldfish trying to understand the fishbowl from the inside.\u201d\n\nIndeed. Considered as a kind of shield, the heliosphere acts as a brake on\ngalactic radiation, but predicting its effects, and even more significantly\nits shape and size over time, is all but impossible. We tend to refer to the\nheliosphere as a \u2018bubble,\u2019 but it\u2019s a poor term given that the shape changes\nwith solar output and interactions with the LISM. A variety of potential\nshapes for the heliosphere remain in play in the literature. Have a look at\nthe figure below, which represents just one of the numerous possibilities.\n\nImage: One recent study of the heliosphere\u2019s shape posited a croissant-shape\nor small spherical shape with tail lobes. Credit: Figure adapted from Merav\nOpher et al., 2020.\n\nAs Spitzer and colleagues note:\n\n> Small variations in model parameters and properties measured in the nose of\n> the heliosphere, the leading edge in the direction of the Sun\u2019s motion\n> through the LISM, lead to significant differences in the projected shape.\n> The global response of the heliosphere is additionally expected to fluctuate\n> with solar activity and therefore solar cycle..., which is yet another\n> element in the interplay of heliosphere\u2013interstellar interactions and\n> another factor in our uncertainty of the overall shape. The main features of\n> the shape of the heliosphere include the nose; the tail, which can be\n> defined relative to the Sun as the region of the heliosphere found in the\n> direction opposite the Sun\u2019s motion through the LISM; the size of the\n> heliosphere; and the behavior of the magnetic field lines at the\n> heliospheric boundaries. All of these properties, including the size of the\n> heliosphere, vary vastly in different proposed shapes and models of the\n> heliosphere, which range in size anywhere from hundreds to thousands of au\n> and in shape from comet- or magnetosphere-like or otherwise with extended\n> tails... to spherical to croissant-shaped with multiple tail lobes...\n\nBear in mind that the heliosphere is a moving target. As recently as 60,000\nyears ago, the Sun entered what is called the Local Interstellar Cloud, and is\nnow considered to be at that cloud\u2019s edge or perhaps beyond it and in contact\nwith surrounding clouds. The JHU/APL Interstellar Probe study notes that\nwithin 2000 years, our system will likely be within a completely different\ninterstellar environment. The heliosphere will adjust. Let me quote the\nInterstellar Probe report on this, because the effects are startling when we\nconsider the Sun\u2019s 20 revolutions around the galactic core since its\nformation:\n\n> The orders-of-magnitude differences in interstellar properties have had\n> dramatic consequences for the penetration of interstellar gas, dust, and\n> galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) that have affected elemental and isotopic\n> abundances, chemical atmospheric evolution, and perhaps even biological\n> evolution. Along the evolutionary path, high interstellar cloud densities\n> and ionization fractions have likely compressed the heliosphere down to\n> below 25 au... Evidence is emerging for supernovae explosions as recent as 3\n> million years ago at only 20\u201350 pc from the Sun that probably compressed the\n> heliosphere even below the orbit of Saturn and perhaps more, exposing the\n> terrestrial planets to almost the full force of interstellar material and\n> GCRs...\n\nThe GCR\u2019s referenced above are galactic cosmic rays, high energy particles and\nheavy nuclei that can prove lethal to biology. The shielding effects of the\nheliosphere are all too easy to take for granted until we consider its\nmalleable nature, so the more we learn about what affects it the better. The\nJHU/APL work highlights a probe trajectory that will not only sample the local\ninterstellar medium but give us the \u2018look back\u2019 capability to see it as a\nwhole, with the probe exiting the heliosphere at approximately 45 degrees off\nthe heliopause nose direction.\n\nThis trajectory is attractive because it allows the heliopause and local\ninterstellar medium to be reached within a reasonable timeframe, which in this\ncontext means something less than 50 years with current propulsion\ntechnologies. It also offers what the authors call \u201csomewhat of a side view of\nthe heliopause,\u201d though one in the direction of the nose, and it allows the\nIBEX ribbon, a still puzzling region of enhanced Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA)\nemission in the outer heliosphere, to be probed.\n\nBut a trajectory through the IBEX ribbon center is only one of those that\nSpitzer and team analyze, ranging from the heliosphere nose to various angles\nout of the heliotail, the trailing part of the heliosphere in relation to the\nSun\u2019s motion through the medium. Here again I\u2019m reminded of how little we know\nof the heliosphere\u2019s shape, for some estimates of the heliotail have it\nextending more than 5000 AU downwind of the Sun. Hence the value of this\npaper, which assembles what our indirect observing methods have so far\nproduced by way of data on the various defined parts of the heliosphere.\n\nTo facilitate mission planning, the paper proposes continued indirect\nmeasurements of ENA and the pickup ions (PUI) that facilitate a stronger ENA\nflux, emphasizing the heliotail, and measurements of interstellar ions that\npenetrate the heliosphere, including cosmic rays in the heliotail region. For\nthe in situ measurements, the authors point out that the largest differences\nbetween the suggested shapes of the heliosphere would appear in the tail\nregion. Our probe would thus do best to exit through the side of the\nheliosphere\u2019s tail. Better still, the authors say, would be a two-spacecraft\nInterstellar Probe mission option reminiscent of the twin Voyager missions,\none moving toward the nose, the other in the direction of the heliotail.\n\nA great idea, but try to get that through the various funding entities... Even\nso:\n\n> Only a study of the tailward region of the heliosphere will give definitive\n> evidence for the complete shape, which impacts how the heliosphere interacts\n> with the LISM and therefore how the LISM impacts the composition of the\n> heliosphere. Therefore, complementary in situ and indirect interstellar\n> measurements must be made tailward within the heliosphere. These\n> measurements can be made through the use of intentional instrumentation\n> requirements for outer heliosphere missions. Additionally, it would be\n> beneficial for the Interstellar Probe mission to either consider a\n> trajectory through the heliotail, via the flank, or to comprise a unified\n> mission of two spacecraft, in which a second Interstellar Probe would be\n> launched with a tailward trajectory, perhaps intersecting one of the\n> proposed...tail lobes.\n\nThe paper is Spitzer et al, \u201cComplementary interstellar detections from the\nheliotail,\u201d Frontiers in Astronomy and Space Sciences (08 February 2024).

This same propulsion method could get us anywhere in the Sol\nsystem itself in record times that would make New Horizons 9-year journey to\nPluto seem like a snail\u2019s crawl.\n\nNow the new Netflix series 3 Body Problem has revived a version of this method\nfor the unwashed masses:\n\nhttps://www.inverse.com/science/3-body-problem-nuclear-propulsion\n\nLots of great links in the above piece, by the way.\n\nAnd here is something I wrote on the same subject in this blog in 2016, which\nalso has multiple useful subject links:\n\nhttps://www.centauri-dreams.org/2016/09/16/project-orion-a-nuclear-bomb-and-\nrocket-all-in-one/\n\nReply\n\n     * Michael on April 4, 2024 at 3:50\n\nWith Starship getting better and better moving large masses in orbit the\nnuclear option becomes more plausible.\n\nReply\n\n  2. Christian G on April 3, 2024 at 17:32\n\nWelcome back Paul!\n\nSomething that struck me reading the article \u2013 the figure says the solar wind\nstarts slowing around 4 AU \u2013 has there been any study of how that changes\nbased on angle out of the ecliptic? It seems like that\u2019s another factor that\nwould affect the heliosphere\u2019s shape.

I don\u2019t know how they \u201cspread\u201d (angular width),\nwhich will depend greatly on the magnetic field lines at their origin and\nwithin the corona. Nevertheless, deceleration of the wind will be highest in\nthe apparent direction of the ISM \u201cwind\u201d. I didn\u2019t look for a detailed\ndescription of the process but perhaps Paul will find one in his search.\n\nReply\n\n  3. Ivar Brouwer on April 4, 2024 at 8:48\n\nI would assume the nanogram space solar sail probes as intended to go to\nProxima Centauri would be an ideal testing opportunity for the technology,\nenable measurements from multiple directions, and make repeat visits to the\nregion more plausible to figure out changes over time. This is probably\npreferable over a single flagship probe, that can easily fail or crash into a\nmicro meteorite along the way, and what\u2019s the hurry? the solar sail probes\nwill probably be faster, catching up with the larger slower probe anyway. Is\nthere a draw back on waiting for the tech required to come of age?\n\nReply\n\n  4. Mike Serfas on April 5, 2024 at 8:12\n\nWe speak of winds, shock waves, and \u201csounding\u201d, which receives a sort of echo\nof variations in the solar wind. The Voyager Plasma Wave Instrument picks up\nplasma wave oscillations (which seems appropriate to call \u201csound\u201d such as it\nexists in this phase of matter) from some significant distance away. If the\nSolar System had some probes in the heliopause, at rest relative to the local\nmedium, designed to listen as carefully as humanly possible, could they hear\nasteroids, spaceships, etc. as they pass through the heliopause at high speed?\nFrom how far away?\n\nReply\n\n### Submit a Comment Cancel reply\n\n## Charter\n\nIn Centauri Dreams, Paul Gilster looks at peer-reviewed research on deep space\nexploration, with an eye toward interstellar possibilities.
