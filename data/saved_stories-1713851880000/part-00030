And yes, the chances of advertisers changing their minds over advertising\nthere are slim to none.\n\nBut, with a slew of new moves like hiring sprees, schmoozing with creators and\nmedia personalities, dangling payment talks, tossing in some fresh features,\nand beefing up its ad safety, maybe \u2014 just maybe \u2014 X\u2019s ad sales execs will\nmanage to raise an eyebrow or two.\n\nUntil recently, this plan appeared more like random musings \u2014 a tweet here, a\npartnership there. But recent months have seen it morph into a more fleshed-\nout strategy, according to a pitch deck Digiday obtained. In it, X\u2019s ad sales\nteam tout AI-powered search, peer-to-peer payments, premium content as well as\nenhanced performance \u2014 though X did not divulge specific timelines in the\ndeck.\n\nClearly, not all these moves are aimed at advertisers. In fact, many of them\nare focused on the platform\u2019s user base, giving existing ones more reasons to\nspend more time there and new ones more reasons to sign up for it. Still, the\nfact they\u2019re being flagged to advertisers now shows that X knows it has to\nfind ways to make it harder for advertisers to say no to advertising there.\nAnd if there\u2019s one thing advertisers can\u2019t ignore, it\u2019s reach.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of X\u2019s plans for the remainder of this year:\n\n## The numbers\n\nWhen it comes to users, X has seen a 55% average increase in mobile daily\nsign-ups within the last six months, while it boasts 10 billion monthly site\nvisits, according to internal data referenced in an April newsletter to\nagencies distributed by the platform, and seen by Digiday. And for brands, X\nclaims it has seen a 63% increase in brand likes, 20% increase in brand re-\nposts and a 14% increase in brand impressions in the same time period,\naccording to the newsletter.\n\n## Video\n\nVideo is set to be the backbone of X\u2019s play for more ad dollars moving\nforward. CEO Linda Yaccarino said so herself, last month. At the time, she\nquote-posted X\u2019s own data, which stated that four out of every five sessions\non the app now include watching video. Not only that, but video views are\ngrowing at an average rate of 35% year over year, while the average time spent\non video has increased by 17%, according to that post.\n\nThat message comes through loud and clear in the pitch deck. When comparing\nvideo views year-over-year between 2022 to 2023, the deck stated that content\nfrom the NBA saw a 105% increase, New York Fashion Week saw a 199% increase\nand college football saw a 249% increase in views, while the Grammy\u2019s saw a\n56% increase.\n\nLooking ahead to the rest of the year, a period brimming with sporting events,\nthe deck highlighted key events including the Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix (May\n17), UEFA Euro 2024 (starting June 14) as well as the Paris Olympic and\nParalympic Games (kick off on July 26), among others, as upcoming partnership\nopportunities. X is trying to reassert its credentials as the go-to\ndestination for experiencing major events alongside others.\n\n## Talent\n\nLike so many of its counterparts, X has made a beeline for creators \u2014 or at\nleast it\u2019s going to try. The more creator content it can aggregate on the\nplatform the more attention it should theoretically be able to monetize. There\nhave been flashes of this over the last year or so with X tempting creators\nwith ad-sharing payouts alongside big deals for high-profile media\npersonalities to stream their shows to the app.\n\nWhether creators will reciprocate the platform\u2019s enthusiasm remains to be\nseen. Recent events cast some doubt on this. For example, the platform\u2019s\npartnership with Don Lemon, former CNN anchor, came to an abrupt end last\nmonth following an interview he did with Musk. Additionally, an experiment\nconducted by popular creator MrBeast appeared to be marred by the fact that\nthe video was repeatedly pushed into users\u2019 feeds without clear labeling,\ncausing confusion and potentially compromising its effectiveness as an\nadvertisement.\n\nBut let\u2019s not write off the plan just yet. X still boasts partnerships with\nfigures like Tulsi Gabbard, former Democratic presidential candidate, and Jim\nRome, the sports talk radio host, as of the time of writing.\n\nUpcoming developments could add to those. The platform plans to incorporate\ncreator sponsorships that align with premium video, according to the deck.\nDetails on how those sponsorships will work and be valued were not included in\nthe deck.\n\n\u201cOne product that has been discussed would allow advertisers to curate a list\nof creator talent and promoted video ads would run as a placement on the\ncreators\u2019 profile,\u201d said one ad exec, who exchanged anonymity for candor.\n\u201cThough it doesn\u2019t seem like it would have a ton of scale.\u201d\n\nAnother example X is pushing, which aims to enable advertisers to capitalize\noff of a creator\u2019s reach, is Mr Beast. From Q2 2024, brands have the\nopportunity to align their pre-roll ads with the influencer\u2019s content on X,\nand serve ads directly on his X profile, according to the April newsletter.\n\nWhy would this matter? According to the newsletter, Mr Beast records 12\nmillion impressions and one million video views per day, while his audience\nskews young: 54% are younger than 24, while a further 29%, according to the\ndocument, are aged between 25 to 34 \u2014 meaning Mr Beast\u2019s audience straddles\nthe two key audiences marketers target: Gen Z predominantly, but also\nmillennials.\n\n## E-commerce\n\nGiven the push for social commerce, and Musk\u2019s push for the platform to become\nwhat he has called the \u201ceverything app\u201d expect the platform\u2019s integration with\nShopify from earlier this year to play a big part of that.\n\nWhile there has been no official confirmation yet about how this will work,\nthe likelihood is that data will be relayed back to the X ads delivery system\nwhen a user they have served an ad to reaches the Shopify sales confirmation\npage. So rather than relying on a conversion pixel, or a custom server-to-\nserver integration (such as CAPi), Shopify would facilitate that data.\n\n\u201cThe integration would be beneficial for both measurement and to improve\ntargeting,\u201d said the ad exec.\n\n## Programmatic\n\nProgrammatic advertising remains a crucial component in X\u2019s strategy to\nsustain ad revenue flow. Last year, it inked deals with InMobi and Google to\nexpand the availability of its ad inventory beyond its proprietary ad manager.\nHowever, progress on this front has been gradual. Initial testing for X\u2019s\nprogrammatic buying was conducted in the APAC region in October, with global\nexpansion slated for the first quarter of 2024, according to an ad executive\nwho Digiday granted anonymity for candor. \u201cThat timeframe has come and gone,\nand we\u2019ve received no further updates regarding availability,\u201d they stated.\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Reddit\n\nhttps://digiday.com/?p=541600\n\nTrending in Marketing on Platforms\n\n  * 01\n\nMarketing on Platforms\n\nMeta advertisers are adrift in adversity as bug-filled problems persist\n\n  * 02\n\nMarketing on Platforms\n\nMeta\u2019s Threads expected to have ads this year\n\n  * Sponsored\n\nHow Campbell\u2019s and GSK\u2019s multi-platform campaigns achieved authentic audience\nresponses\n\n  * 03\n\nMarketing on Platforms\n\nWhy B2B marketers are advertising more like consumer brands to break through a\ncrowded marketplace\n\nMost Read\n\n  * 01\n\nMarketing on Platforms\n\nMeta advertisers are adrift in adversity as bug-filled problems persist\n\n  * 02\n\nMarketing on Platforms\n\nMeta\u2019s Threads expected to have ads this year\n\n  * 03\n\nPublishing in the Platform Era\n\nPublishers test new TikTok feature that adds links to organic videos\n\n  * 04\n\nWTF Series\n\nWTF is the American Privacy Rights Act\n\n  * 05\n\nMarketing on Platforms\n\nWhy B2B marketers are advertising more like consumer brands to break through a\ncrowded marketplace\n\n### More in Marketing\n\nView More\n\nGaming & Esports\n\n#### How Amazon Prime\u2019s \u2018Fallout\u2019 series highlights the power of post-\napocalyptic video game IP\n\nApril 22, 2024 \u2022 5 min read\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Reddit\n\nTo some extent, the mainstream success of the \u201cFallout\u201d series is a reflection\nof the massive scale of the Amazon Prime machine.
