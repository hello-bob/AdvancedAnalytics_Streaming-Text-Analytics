B) A 250-mL three-necked\nround-bottomed flask was equipped with a thermometer, a 50-mL dropping funnel,\na stir bar, and connected to a 200mL Schlenk flask equipped with a bubbler.\nCredit: Science (2024). DOI: 10.1126/science.adn7006\n\nThe chemical industry has been using a reaction with explosive chemicals for\nmore than 100 years\u2014now M\u00fclheim scientists have discovered a safer\nalternative. The Ritter Group of the Max Planck Institut f\u00fcr Kohlenforschung\nin M\u00fclheim/Ruhr has published a paper, titled \"Nitrate reduction enables safer\naryldiazonium chemistry,\" about aryldiazonium in Science.\n\nExplosions and poisoning. Serious injuries and even deaths. In the history of\nthe chemical industry there have been repeated accidents, sometimes fatal,\noften caused by dangerous and explosive chemicals that are required for\ncertain reactions.\n\nAryldiazonium salts, which have been used for 140 years, are such chemicals.\nThey are very reactive and therefore extremely useful for producing other\ncompounds\u2014dyes, for example. However, the high reactivity means that isolated\naryldiazonium salts are not very stable and can therefore react\nunintentionally and sometimes explosively.\n\nOn December 23, 1969, there was a particularly serious explosion involving\nthese chemicals at Ciba AG in Basel. A building was destroyed and heavy pieces\nof the reactor flew through the air. Three workers lost their lives and 31\nwere seriously injured. Despite such horrific reports, work continues with\naryldiazonium salts.\n\nA team led by Prof. Dr. Tobias Ritter, director at the Max Planck Institute\nfor Kohlenforschung, has now succeeded in making the risky chemistry with\naryldiazonium salts significantly safer. The M\u00fclheim Protocol not only makes\nthe use of these compounds less dangerous, but also potentially opens up\nopportunities for the development of new reactions.\n\n\"Normally, the use of diazonium salts takes place in two steps: you first\nisolate or accumulate the diazonium salt, which is dangerous, and then convert\nit into the desired product in a second step. In our project, we combine the\ntwo synthesis steps and go to the desired product without accumulating the\ndiazonium salt, which significantly reduces the risk of an explosion,\"\nexplains Tim Schulte, a doctoral student from Tobias Ritter's group.\n\nTraditionally, aryldiazonium salts are synthesized from anilines with nitrous\nacid, or with nitrite compounds, a reaction that has experienced little\ninnovation over the years. The reaction must be carried out at low\ntemperatures (below 5\u00b0C) because the aryldiazonium salts are unstable at\nhigher temperatures. However, Javier Mateos, a postdoctoral researcher in the\ngroup, and Schulte have discovered a new method that allows the presence of\ndifferent nucleophiles in the reaction mixture.\n\nThe new strategy is based on the use of a natural process, nitrate reduction,\nwhich is carried out in plants. The researchers managed to imitate the natural\nprocess in a test tube and combine it with aryl diazonium chemistry to develop\na safer synthesis method. This way, the above-mentioned limitations associated\nwith traditional methods such as temperature sensitivity and the need for\nstrong acids can be avoided.\n\nBecause the researchers combine several steps in their new protocol, large\nconcentrations of the dangerous substance do not arise in the first place. And\nthat's not all the scientists from M\u00fclheim discovered.\n\n\"For our synthesis method, we use chemicals that are used in large quantities\nin the fertilizer and fuel industries and are therefore inexpensive,\" says\nSchulte. This could make the synthesis route extremely interesting for\ncompanies in the chemical industry as it means lower production costs.\n\n\"The solution to the problem could actually have been found 100 years ago, but\nthe reaction as it has now been discovered would probably not have been\nplanned the same way,\" says Tobias Ritter.\n\n\"The combination of chemicals that ultimately produces good results was\ndiscovered by chance while we were working on another project,\" reveals\nMateos. Although the reagents used have been known for a long time, their\npotential for diazonium chemistry had simply been overlooked until now.\n\nThe new method is also exciting scientifically because new chemical approaches\ncan now be pursued, that would not be readily possible with the classic method\ndue to the high risk of explosion and instability of the connections.\n\nMore information: Javier Mateos et al, Nitrate reduction enables safer\naryldiazonium chemistry, Science (2024).
