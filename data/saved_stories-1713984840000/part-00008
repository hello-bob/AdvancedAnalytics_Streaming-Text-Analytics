The bill would extend copyright\nprotection to codes (such as building codes) that are developed by standards\ndevelopment organizations (SDOs) and incorporated by reference into local,\nstate, and federal laws, as long as the SDOs make the codes \u201cavailable to the\npublic free of charge online in a manner that does not substantially disrupt\nthe ability of those organizations to earn revenue.\u201d\n\nThis is the latest development in a long-running battle between SDOs and\npublic interest groups that have posted online standards incorporated by\nreference. SDOs have sued these public interest groups for copyright\ninfringement, and the public interest groups have argued that once the\nstandards are incorporated by reference, they lose their copyright protection.\nThe public interest groups have argued in the alternative that the fair use\nright permits the online posting of the standards. The courts have ruled in\nfavor of the public interest groups on the fair use theory without addressing\nthe protectability argument. The Pro Codes Act seeks to foreclose the\nprotectability argument without directly implicating the fair use theory.\n\nThe SDOs supporting the Pro Codes Act assert that it would increase access to\nthe law by incentivizing the SDOs to provide online \u201creading rooms\u201d where the\npublic could read the standards incorporated by reference. However, such\nreading rooms are unnecessary because public interest groups already provide\nfree online access to the standards in more usable formats. As Corynne\nMcSherry, legal director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), stated:\n\u201cThis legislation is a solution in search of a problem: at least one public\ninterest organization is already providing much better access to the law, also\nfor free, with no financial impact on the standard organizations.\u201d In 2023,\nMcSherry successfully represented Public.Resource.Org in ASTM v.\nPublic.Resource.Org, where the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit held\nthat fair use permitted Public.Resource.Org to post online codes incorporated\nby reference because it served a nonprofit, educational purpose.\n\nDuring last week\u2019s markup of the Pro Codes Act, Representative Zoe Lofgren\nintroduced dozens of amendments to improve the bill, one of which would codify\nthe ASTM precedent established by the DC Circuit. Unfortunately, the committee\nrejected this amendment. (In fact, the committee voted down all of Lofgren\u2019s\namendments, except for one that would require the Government Accountability\nOffice to study the effects of the bill.)\n\nRep. Lofgren also entered into the record an opposition letter in which a\ncoalition of libraries, civil society, disability rights groups, and others\nargue that providing free access to the law furthers the fundamental purpose\nof copyright, which is to allow public access to knowledge. Some of the\nletter\u2019s signers also made this point in an amicus brief in ASTM v.\nPublic.Resource.Org:\n\nThe Copyright Act ultimately aims to achieve the constitutional goal to\n\u201cpromote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited\nTimes to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective\nWritings and Discoveries.\u201d U.S. Const. art 1, cl. 8, sec. 8.\n\nDuring last week\u2019s markup, some members of the House Judiciary Committee\ndisplayed a fundamental misunderstanding of copyright law. Proponents of Pro\nCodes claimed that the bill would strike a balance between copyright law and\npublic access to information. But copyright law and access to information are\nnot in tension; facilitating access to information is the constitutional\npurpose of copyright, as the library and civil society groups wrote in their\nbrief in support of Public.Resource.Org.\n\nSome members of the committee tried to parse standards incorporated by\nreference from other elements of the law. But as Rep. Lofgren rightly noted,\nin 2020 the Supreme Court reaffirmed the \u201cgovernment edicts doctrine\u201d that\nworks created by government officials in the course of their official duties\nare not copyrightable. Accordingly, when a work is incorporated by reference\ninto an official government document it has the force of law and belongs in\nthe public domain. In 2019, the Library Copyright Alliance (LCA) filed an\namicus brief in State of Georgia v. Public.Resource.Org asking the Supreme\nCourt to affirm this reasoning, and explaining how libraries rely on the\ngovernment edicts doctrine to preserve and provide access to the cultural\nrecord, including all elements of the law.\n\nAnother flawed argument by lawmakers at the Pro Codes markup is that standards\nincorporated by reference is an unfair \u201ctaking\u201d of the SDOs\u2019 copyrights under\nthe Fifth Amendment. As the lawmakers\u2019 argument goes, governments must\ncompensate property owners when they take over private property for public use\nunder eminent domain; similarly, the government should extend copyright to the\nSDOs in exchange for the use of their standards. But this analogy falls apart\nbecause there is no reluctance on the part of the SDOs for the adoption of\ntheir standards; in fact, the SDOs actively lobby governments to adopt their\nstandards.\n\nA related argument by supporters of the Pro Codes Act is that the SDOs provide\na valuable service, and therefore they deserve a revenue stream in exchange\nfor their contribution to the public good. But copyright law does not grant\ncopyright to reward hard work (Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service).\nFurther, the DC Circuit Court found that although Public.Resource.Org has been\nposting incorporated standards for 15 years, \u201cthe plaintiffs have been unable\nto produce any economic analysis showing that Public Resource\u2019s activity has\nharmed any relevant market for their standards. To the contrary, ASTM\u2019s sales\nhave increased over that time.\u201d The SDOs can also derive significant revenue\nfrom selling training materials and programs. SDOs do not need a copyright\nincentive; the development of standards advances the economic interests of\ntheir members.\n\nAdditionally, Rep. Lofgren pointed out that, in 2020, the Supreme Court in\nGeorgia v. Public.Resource.Org found constitutional limits to legislatures\u2019\nability to expand copyright. Chief Justice Roberts stated \u201cno one can own the\nlaw\u201d and reaffirmed that if \u201cevery citizen is presumed to know the law, ... it\nneeds no argument to show ... that all should have free access\u201d to its\ncontents. Pro Codes would be unconstitutional under the First, Fifth, and\nFourteenth amendments, which guarantee the public\u2019s rights to read, share, and\ndiscuss the law.\n\nIt is worth noting that several House Judiciary Committee members made nearly\nidentical arguments in favor of the bill, and I assume the standards\ndevelopment organizations circulated talking points in advance of the markup.\nWe know that passing the Pro Codes Act is a major legislative priority for the\nSDOs.\n\nARL and our fellow advocates are disappointed that the Pro Codes Act will\nadvance to the House, particularly since the House did not hold a hearing on\nthe bill. We remain grateful to Representative Lofgren, who has defended\ncopyright law against overprotection for decades.\n\nKatherine Klosek is the Director of Information Policy and Federal Relations\nat the Association of Research Libraries.

Yeah, the park we were in had fixed bathrooms (and even cleaned them right after the eclipse so we had clean bathrooms to use before heading out) and a big row of porta potties, but neither ever got crowded. there was a *good* sized crowd but never got crowded\n  * The one thing we didn't really have where we were was a good view of the 360 degree sunset. I remember that from the last one we saw. but didn't really see it this time due to trees around the park.\n  * You should have driven over to where we were! No traffic, very few clouds.\n  * mildconcern: yeah I did not have as good a view of the 360 as I did in Casper Wyoming. It was pretty good and you got a sense of it because we were on a lakeshore but the other angles were mountains\n  * John Roddy: Unfortunately, I had a dentist appointment at just barely after the right time. :/\n  * Which is the only reason I'm able to eat anything again.\n  * Mike Masnick: we really lucked out in 2017, because we found this random hill in the middle of absolute nowhere, eastern oregon, that gave us a 360 degrees view of NOTHING but fields from the top. It was a perfect spot to watch\n  * John Roddy: They had to try like 20 different times to get the right set of x-rays.\n  * Mike Masnick: Yikes.\n  * John Roddy: So I'm expecting to grow a second tongue within the next few days or something.\n  * Interestingly, x-ray tech has finally been miniaturized enough that the camera is entirely handheld now.\n  * The tube just has a really thick glass shield lining the end of it, presumably lined with lead.\n  * deadspatula: Fascinatingly, the big advancement has been in better dosing, not simply the size of components. The big machines needed a big burst and leaked a lot of x-rays. That's why the dentist had to hide behind the lead wall and we covered the reproductive organs - the dose wasn't bad once every six months, but multiple times a day would be serious. And the units therefore needed to be mounted. The handheld units better direct a much lower dose, and manufacturers claim technicians do not get dangerous doses of stray x-rays. That said, the notable property of x-rays is penetration. Many of the units I've seen have a guard as you describe, but nothing opaque, and if its not opaque its not lined with enough lead to matter.\n  * John Roddy: Lead lined glass is almost certainly more than enough to at least scatter any stray x-rays that find their way back.\n  * But yeah, x-ray tech in general got a pretty significant overhaul in the past decade or so.\n  * When Chandra launched in '99, it was the heaviest payload the shuttle ever carried.\n  * Fast forward to '21, and we've got IXPE.\n  * Chandra is close to 6,000kg.\n  * IXPE is just over 300.\n  * mildconcern: I wonder how much the general advancement of detectors driven by the cell phone camera revolution has spilled over. That certainly has helped the field of astronomical detection quite a bit.\n  * Digital sensors that had laughable resolution used to cost a fortune in the 1990s when they started to come out. And now you can get miracle devices for far less.\n  * John Roddy: Cell phone stuff is all in the microwave range.\n  * That's most useful for detecting the cosmic microwave background, which is probably the closest thing to a natural encyclopedia we're ever going to get.\n  * mildconcern: phone cameras also do sense visual light\n  * John Roddy: I feel like everyone I tell this to is hearing it for the first time, but...\n  * I *thought* it was common knowledge that your phone camera is pretty good at seeing infrared too.\n  * It's a really quick and easy way to check if a remote control is working.\n  * Infrared LEDs *will* be visible through the sensor.\n  * mildconcern: Oh yeah I knew that, I was just being a wiseass\n  * it's not hugely far in the infrared spectrum\n  * can't use it as a heat detector or something. Just a smidge.\n  * but I'm mostly saying in terms of astronomy applications. The overall success in designing sensors and detectors in smaller scales has hugely helped anyway\n  * no matter the wavelengths\n  * John Roddy: Yeah, the interesting stuff requires some pretty intense tech.\n  * Almost everything glows in the infrared spectrum, after all.\n  * mildconcern: It's a big part of why they stuck the JWT in space\n  * since it's mostly working in that range\n  * John Roddy: That's only half the story\n  * Spritzer needed some pretty extreme shielding too.\n  * Except the tech wasn't *quite* ready to make the active cooling reliable enough.\n  * A lot of people think of \"cold\" in terms of what chilly weather feels like on earth.\n  * The cold air sucks the heat right out of you.\n  * But space doesn't have that air.\n  * So despite space being extremely cold, it's actually really hard to cool things down out there.\n  * The reason the space shuttle always had the bay doors open in orbit is because that's where the radiators were.\n  * mildconcern: yeah. but the IR wavelengfths that JWT are detecting can't even get through at all even in Earth orbit\n  * so that's why it's out at the Lagrange Point\n  * Despite the \"can't fuck this one up and fix it later\" nature of that as opposed to Hubble\n  * John Roddy: It's not even *at* the Lagrange point\n  * It's in an orbit around it\n  * Samuel Abram: I took a screencap of a thread on facebook, to illustrate the necessity of checkmarks as verification and not a marker of a paid status.\n  * Unfortunately, I can't upload it here\n  * [link]\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/17P1ICo5rwQcW4dnkY8KSX8XzdIXoSQZN/view?usp=drive_link\n\n  * John Roddy: Wow.
