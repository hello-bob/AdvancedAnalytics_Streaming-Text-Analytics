And now, it\nis hard to imagine how the chip maker could have possibly thrived without a\nrevitalized GPU compute engine business.\n\nIntel knows a thing or two about this, as we have discussed recently, but even\nIntel says it will benefit later this year from the generative AI wave with\nits Gaudi line of matrix math accelerators, which have just been upgraded with\ntheir third generation.\n\nAMD is doing a whole lot better than it ever has with datacenter compute\nengines, which is something that many of us are not yet used to. Intel still\nhas a bigger server CPU business than AMD, but AMD arguably has a stronger\none. But as we have said before, we think that the datacenter CPU market will\nsettle out with a cut-throat battle between Intel and AMD, with each having\nsomewhere around 40 percent share of CPU sales and various Arm processors \u2013\nsome of them homegrown and used by the cloud builders and hyperscalers that\ncomprise more than half of the market \u2013 and things like IBM mainframe and\nPower and emerging RISC-V CPUs comprising the remaining 20 percent.\n\nWe also think that the X86 architecture will be the new legacy platform, and\nthat Intel and AMD have no desire to compete directly with emerging Arm chips.\nThey know a lot of enterprise code is written for X86 platforms and that this\nis not going to change quickly. Just ask IBM, which is still selling plenty of\nSystem z mainframes and Power Systems based on its own chips.\n\nAMD\u2019s continuing rise in the datacenter, despite a server recession outside of\nmassive investments in GPU-accelerated AI servers, is still a thing to behold.\nIt is not as dramatic as the rocket rise of Nvidia in the datacenter, but it\nis a reasonably close second.\n\nIn the first quarter ended in March, AMD\u2019s overall revenues were only up 2.2\npercent to $5.47 billion, and fell 11.3 percent sequentially, which is more or\nless normal for a Q1 in any year. AMD posted a $123 million net income, which\nwas a considerable improvement over the $139 million loss it posted in the\nyear-ago period.\n\nAMD exited the quarter with $6.04 billion in the bank, which is most assuredly\na comfort to chief executive officer Lisa Su but is one-quarter the cash hoard\nthat Nvidia has and which will probably be one-tenth the size as Nvidia gets\nto the end of this calendar year. We are projecting that Nvidia will break\nthrough $100 billion in sales in fiscal 2025 (roughly analogous to calendar\n2024) and will possibly have $75 billion in cash in the bank by year\u2019s end.\n\nNvidia is not getting easier to compete against, but more formidable. But\nthere is always room for a second, staunch competitor \u2013 and the market most\ndefinitely wants an alternative to the Nvidia stack to drive up competition\nand to drive down costs.\n\nIn the March quarter, AMD\u2019s Data Center group had sales of $2.34 billion, up\n80.5 percent year on year and up 2.4 percent sequentially in what is usually a\ndown quarter for datacenter spending and what is still a weak server CPU\nmarket. (Well, for Intel anyway.) Operating income exploded for the Data\nCenter group in Q1, despite the relatively high cost of making Instinct MI300\nseries GPUs and despite the fact that hyperscalers and national HPC labs both\nargue for and receive very aggressively low pricing on their compute engines,\nputting pressure on margins for all compute engine makers who sell to them. To\nbe precise, AMD\u2019s operating income in the Data Center group was up by a factor\nof 3.65X to $541 million, and this was mostly due to the \u201cGenoa\u201d and \u201cBergamo\u201d\nEpyc 9004 upgrade cycle and rising average selling prices as companies buy\nCPUs with a large amount of cores.\n\nAs we have been arguing for a while, keeping servers in the field longer means\nbuying more top bin parts to stretch the useful life of the machines, and this\nseems to be playing out. Paying the premium to get a top bin part is now worth\nit, and it wasn\u2019t when hyperscalers and cloud builders were only using\nmachines for three years.\n\nWe don\u2019t care about this except inasmuch that success outside of the\ndatacenter means there is less pressure on the datacenter for AMD, but its\nClient group, which makes CPUs, APUs, and GPUs for PCs, turned in its third\nquarter of not completely awful, with revenues up 85.1 percent and posting an\n$86 million operating income, a whole lot better than the $739 million in\nsales and $172 million operating loss in the year-ago period.\n\nGaming GPUs took it on the chin in Q1 2024, with sales off 47.5 percent to\n$922 million and operating income down 51.9 percent to $151 million. The FPGA\nline expressed in the AMD Embedded group is at the beginning of a new product\ncycle, with the initial Versal 2 devices being announced a few weeks ago, and\nit is down 45.8 percent to $846 million, with operating income down 57.1\npercent to $342 million.\n\nEpyc server CPU sales are making up for these revenue and operating income\ndeclines to a certain extent, but AMD must be unhappy that the Gaming and\nEmbedded groups are not doing better.\n\nIn our financial charts, we go back to Q1 2015, which is when AMD laid down\nthe gauntlet and promised to get back into the datacenter market and earn the\nrespect and trust of hyperscaler, cloud builder, HPC center, and enterprise\ncustomers once again after basically ceding compute engines to Intel in 2013\nor so.\n\nBack then, AMD made more money from datacenter GPUs than it did in datacenter\nCPUs \u2013 and it was not very much money in either case, as you can see in the\nchart above. AMD started getting traction in CPUs and GPUs back in 2017, and\nEpyc CPUs took off in 2018 and grew sharply until the server recession hit\nhard, thanks in large part to a curtailing of spending by hyperscalers and\ncloud builders, in Q1 2023. For AMD at least, which has once again become the\ndarling of the hyperscalers and cloud builders and has made inroads again with\nHPC centers, the server CPU recession looks to be mostly over.\n\nAnd, as you can plainly see, Instinct GPU sales, thanks to the \u201cAntares\u201d MI300\nfamily, the third time charm for AMD\u2019s datacenter GPUs. The MI300s can stand\ntoe-to-toe with what Nvidia can ship today, which is \u201cHopper\u201d H100 and H200\nGPU accelerators.\n\nThe MI300A hybrid CPU-GPU device that is part of the 2+ exaflops \u201cEl Capitan\u201d\nsupercomputer being tuned up right now at Lawrence Livermore National\nLaboratory and to the MI300X all-GPU devices that are being installed by\nhyperscalers (particularly Microsoft, Google, and Meta Platforms, if the\nrumors are right), are up like an Nvidia rocket.\n\nRight now, the MI300 is a drag on profits and is not yet at the level of the\noperating profits averaged across all datacenter products, but AMD is working\non that. AMD said on the call that in Q4 2023 and Q1 2024 combined, it sold\nmore than $1 billion in MI300 GPUs. Our model put GPU sales at $415 million in\nQ4 2023 \u2013 driven mostly by the MI300As going into the El Capitan machine \u2013 and\nwe surmise that AMD sold about $610 million in MI300s in Q1 2024 \u2013 driven\nmostly by MI300X devices being sold into the hyperscalers and cloud builders.\nThat $610 million of GPU revenue in Q1 2024 is 47 percent higher sequentially\nand a factor of 9.4X higher year on year \u2013 not just hitting it out of the\nballpark, but hitting it out of the parking lot behind the ballpark. In the\nnext two quarters, AMD will hit it out into the river next to the parking lot.\n. . .\n\nIf you make some assumptions and do the math, as we do in our model, we think\nAMD had around $35 million in DPU sales and maybe $65 million in datacenter\nFPGA sales, which leaves $1.63 billion in Epyc server CPU sales, which is down\n8.1 percent sequentially but up 40.5 percent year on year. Our model shows\nthat hyperscalers and cloud builders acquired $1.15 billion in Epyc CPUs, up\nonly 27.9 percent year on year, but enterprises accounted for the remaining\n$472 million in Epyc CPUs, up 85.2 percent.\n\nAMD has not provided much in the way of CPU forecasting, but since last fall,\nAMD has been putting out guidance on GPU sales and in the Q1 call it raised\nthat guidance for the second time, now saying that it will break $4 billion in\nInstinct CPU sales in 2024.\n\n\u201cThe MI300 ramp is going really well,\u201d Su said on the call with Wall Street\nanalysts after the numbers were put out. \u201cIf we look at just what\u2019s happened\nover the last 90 days, we have been working very closely with our customers to\nqualify MI300 in their production datacenters, both from a hardware standpoint\nand a software standpoint. So far, things are going quite well, and what we\nsee now is just greater visibility to both current customers as well as new\ncustomers committing to MI300. So that gives us the confidence to go from $3.5\nbillion to $4 billion. And I view this \u2013 as you know very much \u2013 as a very\ndynamic market, and there are lots of customers. We have over a hundred\ncustomers that were engaged with in both development as well as deployment. So\noverall the ramp is going really well. As it relates to the supply chain,\nactually I would say I\u2019m very pleased with how supply has ramped. It is\nabsolutely the fastest product ramp that we have done. It\u2019s a very complex\nproduct.\u201d\n\nHere is the history of the forecasts as they changed and how we think the\nquarters would line up against those forecasts:\n\nWe think that the best-case scenario we put together in January of this year\nis still a very possible outcome for the GPU business at AMD. Su was clear,\nonce again, that AMD is not supply constrained at that $4 billion number, any\nmore than it was at that $3.5 billion number. AMD\u2019s potential supply is always\npegged at being larger than its forecast. That said, Su said that AMD was\nabsolutely supply constrained in Q1 and could have sold more GPUs if it had\nthem.\n\nAs the manufacturing process for GPUs improves and AMD makes enough to sell to\nTier 2 service providers and enterprises (who do not get the most aggressive\npricing on any chips), the profitability of those GPU sales will improve even\nfaster. And as the \u201cTurin\u201d Epyc 9005 chips based on the Zen 5 family of cores\ncomes out later this year, the CPU story will only get better, too.\n\nAll within the confines of a re-emerging Intel and the onslaught of homegrown\nArm server CPUs and homegrown AI accelerators among the hyperscalers and cloud\nbuilders. This is the real threat to \u2013 and governor on \u2013 the AMD datacenter\ncompute engine business.\n\nBut for now, AMD is prognosticating that its Data Center group will have\ngrowth in the second quarter of 2024 of \u201cstrong double digits\u201d and that both\nCPU and GPU sales will rise year on year. And the server market itself is\nexpected to improve in the second half \u2013 something that Intel has talked about\nas well. We shall see. We are well aware that there is a lot of older iron out\nthere in the server fleets of the world, but we also know running them for a\nquarter or two more is not going to hurt much and will leave that much more\ndough to apply to AI proofs of concept and actual buildouts.\n\n#### Sign up to our Newsletter\n\nFeaturing highlights, analysis, and stories from the week directly from us to\nyour inbox with nothing in between.

They\u2019re doing great with TSMC (and Global Foundries) as their Fabs,\nbut can they do the same thing they did with Opteron and AMD64 instruction set\nexpansion with the new Epycs? Or has Intel learned it\u2019s lesson about not\ngiving up the lead?\n\nBut since AMD64 is a legacy platform, how will it compete with ARM and RISCV\nup and comers? ARM is making huge gains lately, and for fleets of web\napplication systems, the power/performance numbers are amazing.\n\nBut will ARM and RISCV end up running into the same Spectre type problems at\nx86_64 did? What will be the next architecture based security problem people\nneed to think about? Or are we past the pure performance at all cost to a more\nbalanced world where security is a key driver as well? Especially since the\nlatest JEDEC memory specs are supposed to help reduce Rowhammer type attack\nsurface as well.\n\nAnd of course since I try to root for the underdogs, I\u2019ve been buying AMD CPUs\nfor home for the past 15 years as much as I can, but since absolute speed\nhasn\u2019t gone up that much, 8 year old systems do just fine for home systems\nwhere you just browse the web and other light tasks. It\u2019s the need for Photo\nediting or other expensive tasks like that (and power improvements!) which has\nslowly moved me on to make new investments in systems. But certainly not at\nthe bleeding edge any more.\n\nReply\n\n     * Timothy Prickett Morgan says:\n\nMay 1, 2024 at 10:06 pm\n\nGood questions. At the moment, AMD has Zen and Zen c cores that are in many\nrespects more useful than a separation between E-core and P-core that Intel\nhas. You get the same results without losing so many core features \u2014 literally\nfeatures in the cores. That is just an example of a subtle difference in\narchitecture approach. I strongly suspect AMD will have an interesting twist\non matrix math engines as well, complements of Xilinx, and frankly, am\nsurprised it is not here yet. It can differentiate on Infinity Fabric and CXL\nas well. There are a lot of levers that can be pulled.\n\nReply\n\n  2.
