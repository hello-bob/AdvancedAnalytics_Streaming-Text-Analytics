Let's start.\n\nFree for the first 50 names. No credit card required.\n\n## Frequently asked questions.\n\nBasics\n\n#### What is Bundle of Joy?\n\nBundle of Joy is an app for expecting parents to browse and curate names for\ntheir newborn \u2013 within seconds of signing up. The app takes in the parent\u2019s\npreferences for the name, makes recommendations, and learns from the parent\u2019s\nlikes/dislikes as they browse through the recommendations, and tailors further\nrecommendations.\n\nParents can indicate the baby\u2019s gender, then choose 2 of the following\noptions: indicate the name\u2019s preferred origin/ religion (from 50+ options),\ntheme (from 30+ options), name\u2019s starting letter and name\u2019s meaning. That\u2019s\nit. They start getting gorgeous baby name recommendations for their unique\npreferences. They can modify these preferences at any point, and continue to\nget fresh recommendations for their taste.\n\n#### Do I need a mobile app from Android or Apple store?\n\nNo, you can use Bundle of Joy with a web browser on your mobile.\n\nIf you\u2019re on Android, open Bundle of Joy on your mobile browser, then tap\nInstall and follow the on-screen instructions.\n\nIf you\u2019re on Apple, open Bundle of Joy on your mobile browser. Once the\nwebsite loads, tap the menu button (usually represented by three vertical\ndots) located in the top right corner of the browser. In the menu, scroll down\nand look for the \u201cAdd to Home screen\u201d option. Tap on it and follow the on-\nscreen insuctions.\n\n#### Is it free to use?\n\nBundle of Joy has a free trial. No credit card required. During the trial\nperiod, you can generate up to 50 names as per your preferences. If you like\nthe names you see, we hope you\u2019d consider upgrading to a paid plan by\npurchasing one of the packs.\n\n#### Is it an AI-based name generator?\n\nYes. We use AI to understand your preferences and taste, and make name\nrecommendations that suit your taste well, so you don\u2019t have to go through\n1000s of names from 100s of websites.\n\n#### So, Bundle of Joy is really just ChatGPT for baby names? I can simply use\nChatGPT instead, right?\n\nYes, you may. But here\u2019s a list of things you get only with Bundle of Joy.\n\n  * With Bundle of Joy, you just need 3 clicks (to set up preferences) to start getting name recommendations. In ChatGPT, you have to create and iterate on different prompts before finding a prompt that works.\n  * Recommended names are not repeated in Bundle of Joy, so you don\u2019t see the same name multiple times. ChatGPT will repeat the names.\n  * You can manage a shortlist of names within Bundle of Joy. With ChatGPT, you\u2019re back to maintaining manual shortlists.\n  * The biggest difference \u2192 With Bundle of Joy, you get notified when your Partner likes the same name as you did matches. Not in ChatGPT. You\u2019ll miss this magical moment.\n\nSo, is it worth your time to use ChatGPT? Really up to you!\n\nShortlisting with a partner\n\n#### What are partner matches?\n\nThis is the most fun aspect of Bundle of Joy. Think of it like Tinder, but for\nbaby names. You and your partner log in to your respective accounts (YOU NEED\nSEPARATE ACCOUNTS), input your respective preferences, see name\nrecommendations and start shortlisting names that you individually like. When\nyou both happen to like the same name, the app informs you of a \u201cPartner\nmatch\u201d.\n\nThis is the aha moment many expecting couples wait for (when both of them\nhappen to like the same name, which is not too often :D)\n\n#### How do I connect my partner\u2019s account?\n\nJust go to the \u201cFaves with Partner\u201d section once you log in to the app. You\nwill see clear instructions on how to connect with your partner\u2019s account.\n\n#### Can I use Bundle of Joy without a partner?\n\nYes, you can use Bundle of Joy just by yourself. There are no restrictions\nusing it by yourself without a partner.\n\nFree plans\n\n#### Why is a Free plan available?\n\nAs recent parents, this is the app my wife and I wish we had when we named our\nbaby boy. Bundle of Joy is free to try out. As parents first ourselves, we\nwant to first make sure you feel comfortable to try the product first before\nbuying. Whenever you\u2019re ready to buy, each paid plan is priced very affordably\nand comes with a very generous refund policy.\n\n#### What is available as part of Free plan?\n\nYou can get up to 50 name recommendations. You can shortlist as many as you\nlike from those names. Your partner can also use a free account to generate 50\nname recommendations of their own. Any names that you both liked from your\nrespective accounts will show up as Partner matches.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve used up the 50 free recommendations, you will need to buy one of\nour paid plans to generate new name recommendations.\n\nPaid plans\n\n#### What is a pack?\n\nOnce you\u2019ve used the Free plan and you need more name suggestions, you can buy\none of our packs. Each pack will allow you to generate upto a certain number\nof names. This is indicated as \u201cCount of names\u201d against each pack. For\nexample, our lowest priced pack will allow you to generate up to 100 names.\n\n#### What\u2019s the count of names?\n\nThis is the maximum number of names you can generate per pack. For example,\nthe lowest priced pack can generate up to 100 names for you.\n\n#### What\u2019s the pricing?\n\nThere are several packs available. Check our pricing page.\n\n#### Which pack should I buy?\n\nDepends. Most parents are happy with the \u201c225 names\u201d pack. But please feel\nfree to start with the \u201c100 names\u201d pack too.\n\n#### Can I buy more than one pack?\n\nYes, you can buy more than one pack. You can buy as many as you need, whenever\nyou need. But we restrict you from buying more than one pack at a time. This\nis to make sure you don\u2019t buy more than what you need. If this is an\ninconvenience to you, please just write to us, and we can help you out.\n\n#### I have my partner\u2019s account connected. And I\u2019ve bought a pack. How does\nthis work now?\n\nThe count of names available from your pack is shared between you and your\npartner\u2019s account. Assume you\u2019ve bought a \u201c225 names\u201d pack, both you and your\npartner together can generate upto 225 names. When the count of names\ngenerated by the both of you exceeds 225, you will be asked to buy a new pack.\nAt that point, either of you can buy a new pack, and continue to generate new\nname recommendations.\n\n#### What is validity?\n\nEach pack comes with a validity of 3 months from the date of purchase of the\npack. You must use the pack to generate names before the validity period ends.\nIf for some reason, you need to use a pack after the validity period has\nended, please just write to us., and we can help you out.\n\nRefund policy\n\n#### What is the refund policy?\n\nIn short, our refund policy is focussed on your peace of mind.\n\nOther questions\n\nIf you have any other questions, please reach out to me at this email ID.\n\nI'm ready. Show me some names for my baby.\n\nFree for the first 50 names. No credit card required.\n\n## By recent parents. For expecting parents.\n\nWhen my wife and I were choosing a name for our baby boy in 2021, we:\n\n\ud83e\udd26\u2640\ufe0f bounced around 6 different websites and apps\n\n\ud83e\udd26\u2640\ufe0f went through endless lists of names that didn\u2019t quite match our vibe\n\n\ud83e\udd26\u2640\ufe0f found it tough to keep track of names we liked\n\nNaming our baby boy became just another task on our already looong to-do list\nduring a very busy period.\n\nWe recently realized that we weren\u2019t the only parents who struggled with this.\nSo, we built Bundle of Joy. We hope you like it! \u2764\ufe0f\n\nRead more about why we started Bundle of Joy.\n\n#### Explore baby girl names\n\nGirl names that start with\n\nA | | B | | C | | D | | E | | F | | G | | H | | I | | J | | K | | L | | M | | N | | O | | P | | Q | | R | | S | | T | | U | | V | | W | | X | | Y | | Z | |\n\nPopular girl names right now\n\nUnique girl names\n\nStrong girl names Italian girl names Irish girl names Black girl names Mexican\ngirl names Korean girl names French girl names Greek girl names German girl\nnames Indian girl names\n\nCountry girl names Spanish girl names Russian girl names Hawaiian girl names\nBiblical girl names Chinese girl names\n\n#### Explore baby boy names\n\nBoy names that start with\n\nA | | B | | C | | D | | E | | F | | G | | H | | I | | J | | K | | L | | M | | N | | O | | P | | Q | | R | | S | | T | | U | | V | | W | | X | | Y | | Z | |\n\nPopular girl names right now\n\nUnique boy names\n\nStrong boy names Italian boy names Irish boy names Black boy names Mexican boy\nnames Korean boy names French boy names Greek boy names German boy names\nIndian boy names\n\nCountry boy names Spanish boy names Russian boy names Hawaiian boy names\nBiblical boy names Chinese boy names\n\n#### Explore name generators\n\nPopular generators\n\nMiddle name generator\n\nGirl name generator\n\nBoy name generator\n\nRoyal name generator Russian name generator African name generator Strong name\ngenerator Old fashioned name generator Badass name generator Nature name\ngenerator Anime name generator Modern name generator Short name generator\nGoddess name generator Unique name generator Italian name generator Irish name\ngenerator Black name generator Mexican name generator Korean name generator\nFrench name generator Greek name generator German name generator Indian name\ngenerator Country name generator Spanish name generator Hawaiian name\ngenerator Biblical name generator Chinese name generator\n\n#### Explore baby girl names\n\nGirl names that start with\n\nA | | B | | C | | D | | E | | F | | G | | H | | I | | J | | K | | L | | M | | N | | O | | P | | Q | | R | | S | | T | | U | | V | | W | | X | | Y | | Z | |\n\nPopular girl names right now\n\nUnique girl names\n\nStrong girl names Italian girl names Irish girl names Black girl names Mexican\ngirl names\n\n#### Explore baby boy names\n\nBoy names that start with\n\nA | | B | | C | | D | | E | | F | | G | | H | | I | | J | | K | | L | | M | | N | | O | | P | | Q | | R | | S | | T | | U | | V | | W | | X | | Y | | Z | |\n\nPopular boy names right now\n\nUnique boy names\n\nStrong boy names Italian boy names Irish boy names Black boy names Mexican boy\nnames\n\n#### Explore name generators\n\nPopular generators\n\nMiddle name generator\n\nGirl name generator\n\nBoy name generator\n\nRoyal name generator Russian name generator African name generator\n\nWith \u2764\ufe0f by Parvathi & Ramcha\n\nTerms | Privacy policy | Refunds\n\nGet in touch\n\n\u00a9 2024.
