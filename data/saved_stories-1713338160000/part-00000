unprecedented increases in insecticide applications,\nespecially in maize cultivation. The health and environmental hazards posed by\nthese chemicals have prompted a call for alternative control practices.\nEntomopathogenic nematodes are highly lethal to the FAWs, but their\napplication aboveground has been challenging. In this study, we report on\nseason-long field trials with an innocuous biodegradable gel made from\ncarboxymethyl cellulose containing local nematodes that we specifically\ndeveloped to target the FAW. In several Rwandan maize fields with distinct\nclimatic conditions and natural infestation rates, we compared armyworm\npresence and damage in control plots and plots that were treated with either\nour nematode gel formulation, a commercial liquid nematode formulation, or the\ncommonly used contact insecticide cypermethrin. The treatments were applied to\nthe whorl of each plant, which was repeated three to four times, at 2-week\nintervals, starting when the plants were still seedlings. Although all three\ntreatments reduced leaf damage, only the gel formulation decreased caterpillar\ninfestation by about 50% and yielded an additional ton of maize per hectare\ncompared with untreated plots. Importantly, we believe that the use of\nnematodes can be cost-effective, since we used nematode doses across the whole\nseason that were at least 3-fold lower than their normal application against\nbelowground pests. The overall results imply that precisely formulated and\neasy-to-apply nematodes can be a highly effective, affordable, and sustainable\nalternative to insecticides for FAW control.\n\nbiological control, integrated pest management, sustainable agriculture, food\nsecurity, invasive pest\n\nSubject\n\nAgricultural Sciences\n\nIssue Section:\n\nBiological, Health, and Medical Sciences\n\nEditor: Joann Whalen\n\nJoann Whalen\n\nEditor\n\nSearch for other works by this author on:\n\nOxford Academic\n\nGoogle Scholar\n\nSignificance Statement\n\nEntomopathogenic nematodes are commonly used as biological control agents\nagainst soil pests, but are seldomly used to control foliar insects due to the\nnematodes\u2019 high sensitivity to aboveground abiotic stressors such as\ndesiccation and ultraviolet radiation. We developed an innocuous gel\nformulation specifically designed to protect and apply nematodes to maize\nwhorls to control the fall armyworm, a particularly voracious invasive pest of\nmaize. We demonstrated, under realistic farming conditions, that applying the\ngel formulation every two weeks can successfully control armyworms and\nincrease yields when compared with untreated control plants. The formulation\nprovides new opportunities to contribute to mitigating the impacts of pest\ncontrol practices on the environment and public health, commonly associated\nwith conventional synthetic insecticides.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe fall armyworm (FAW; Spodoptera frugiperda, Smith; Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)\nis a major pest of maize (corn, Zea mays). Originating from the Americas, it\nhas recently spread into Africa and Asia (1\u20133), causing severe plant damage\nand tremendous yield losses (4\u20136). Its invasion threatens the livelihoods of\nmillions of farmers (4, 7, 8) and has led to an excessive reliance on chemical\ninsecticides (6, 9). The environmental and health concerns associated with\npesticides have prompted an urgent need for devising safer and more\nsustainable control measures (4, 6). Several biocontrol agents, including\nentomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs), have emerged as alternatives to chemical\ninsecticides (6, 10, 11).\n\nEPNs are minute soil-dwelling roundworms found worldwide, except in Antarctica\n(12). They exclusively parasitize insects, which they locate with the help of\nchemical cues (13) and enter via natural orifices, or in some cases through\nthe cuticle (14, 15). EPNs carry symbiotic bacteria in their guts that are\nreleased inside their host (14, 15). These bacteria, as well as the EPN, exude\ntoxins that rapidly kill their insect host (14, 15). EPNs can kill a large\nvariety of insects and can be easily mass-produced (16), also in Africa (17).\nThey are safe for humans and the environment (18) and have been successfully\nused as biocontrol agents against belowground insect pests (19). Although EPNs\nare sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and desiccation (14, 20, 21), the\nprotective location of the feeding FAW caterpillars, mostly deep within the\nmaize whorl (1, 22, 23), makes the maize\u2013FAW system a suitable candidate for\nEPN application. Moreover, EPNs exhibit exceptional virulence against FAW with\nthe ability to kill young FAW caterpillars within 24 h (24\u201327), which is\nconsiderably faster than entomopathogenic fungi (10, 28), viruses (11, 29\u201331),\nor parasitoids (32). This makes it possible to apply a far lower dosage of\nEPNs than those normally applied against belowground pests. Furthermore, the\nisolation of highly virulent EPN strains from local soils eliminates the need\nfor introducing nonnative organisms (27, 33), thereby avoiding potential\nregulatory barriers.\n\nIn a recent laboratory study and pilot field experiment, we demonstrated the\npotential of EPNs formulated in a cost-effective gel designed to specifically\ntarget FAW caterpillars feeding on maize (34). The preliminary field trial\nwith just a single application of the EPN-gel formulation suggested that it\ncan reduce FAW infestation and plant damage as effectively as cypermethrin, a\ncommonly used contact insecticide (35). These results prompted us to conduct\nthe present full-scale study to determine whether EPN treatments can control\nFAW as effectively as pesticides and to assess their effects on yield. Here,\nwe report on the successful application of the EPN gel throughout an entire\nmaize growing season in Rwanda, encompassing differing climatic conditions and\ninfestation rates. We compare FAW presence and damage as well as maize yield\nin control plots and plots that were treated with either our in-house\ndeveloped EPN-gel formulation, a commercial liquid EPN formulation, or\ncypermethrin. These findings demonstrate that EPNs formulated in a\nbiodegradable gel represent a safe and effective alternative to insecticides\nfor FAW control, particularly in smallholder farms.\n\n## Results\n\n### Plant damage\n\nThe overall comparison of the control methods revealed that the whorl damage\nof maize differed among treatments (Figs. 1 and S1; treatments: = 36, P <\n0.001; triple interaction [Treatments \u00d7 Application number \u00d7 Assessments]: =\n35.85, P < 0.001) and increased during the season (Fig. 1A; = 1,037, P <\n0.001). Throughout the season, untreated plants were consistently more damaged\nthan treated plants, regardless of the treatment (Fig. 1A: see capital\nletters; P < 0.001). Plants treated with the gel-formulated EPN were less\ndamaged than plants treated with EPNs formulated in the surfactant polymer\nformulation (SPF; P < 0.01) and untreated plants (P < 0.001). The effect of\ntreatment with cypermethrin was intermediate (Fig. 1A). Overall, the\nprobability that a plant suffered severe damage (Davis score > 6) was 14% for\nthe EPN-gel-treated plants, 18% for the cypermethrin-treated plants, and 19%\nfor the EPN-SPF-treated plants. The highest probability of severe damage was\nobserved in untreated control plants (30%). Hence, the EPN-gel treatment\nreduced heavy damage by more than 50%.\n\nFig. 1.\n\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\n\nWhorl damage. A) Estimated marginal means \u00b1 95% CI of recorded whorl damage\nscores averaged for the six fields with each five plots per treatment. The\narrows indicate the days of the treatments (black arrows: all fields treated;\nwhite arrow: only fields I, II, III, and IV treated). B) Probability of a\ngiven damage score within each treatment 7- or 14 days postapplications\naveraged for six fields and three applications. Whorl damage was assessed 7\nand 14 days after each application for 40 plants per plot (n = 30 plots per\ntreatment) using the Davis whorl damage scale (36, 37), where a \u201c0\u201d represents\nan intact whorl and a \u201c9\u201d represents an almost completely or completely\ndestroyed whorl. Data were analyzed using cumulative link mixed models. The\nletters indicate significant differences (P < 0.05) according to multiple\ncomparisons corrected for false discovery using the Benjamini and Hochberg\nmethod (38). Panel A: small letters: differences among treatments at a given\nassessment; capital letters: differences among treatments throughout the field\ntrials.\n\nAt all six measured time points (covering 6 weeks starting when the plants\nwere about 3 weeks old), we found that the plants treated with the EPN gel\nwere considerably less damaged than untreated plants (Fig. 1A). This was still\nevident after the third application (>28 days post first application), when\nplants treated with the EPN gel were less damaged than all other treatments,\nincluding cypermethrin (Fig. 1A: see lowercase letters; at 35 days: gel vs.\ncypermethrin, P < 0.01; gel vs. SPF, P < 0.001; gel vs. control, P < 0.001; at\n42 days: gel vs. cypermethrin, P < 0.001; gel vs. SPF, P = 0.04; gel vs.\ncontrol, P < 0.001).\n\nDamage was more severe 2 weeks after each treatment than after 1 week (Fig.\n1B; = 119, P < 0.001), suggesting that FAW reinfested the plants after each\ntreatment and that a more frequent application of the treatments should\nprovide even better protection against FAW.\n\n### FAW infestation\n\nAfter the third application of the treatments, we dissected a cohort of 10\nplants in the center of each plot to evaluate FAW infestation levels. Overall,\nthe number of caterpillars recovered differed among treatments (Figs. 2 and\nS2; = 22.5, P < 0.001), but only plots treated with the EPN formulated in gel\nwere less infested than untreated control plots (gel vs. control: P < 0.001).\nMore specifically, on average, 13 \u00b1 1.4 SE caterpillars were found in\nuntreated control plots, 12 \u00b1 1.3 in cypermethrin-treated plots, 10 \u00b1 1.1 in\nEPN-SPF-treated plots, and 6.5 \u00b1 0.8 in EPN-gel-treated plots. Reinfestation\nby FAW was prevalent and not affected by any of the treatments, as indicated\nby the similar occurrence of early instar caterpillars (shorter than 0.5 cm)\non plants in all plots (Fig. S3; = 5.2, P = 0.16).\n\nFig. 2.\n\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\n\nNumber of caterpillars per plot. Estimated marginal means \u00b1 95% CI of the\nnumber of caterpillars recovered per plot 5 days after the third application,\naveraged for the six fields with each five plots per treatment. Five days\nafter the third application of the treatments, 10 specific plants per plot (n\n= 30 plots per treatment) were destroyed to inspect for caterpillars. The\nnumber of caterpillars (>0.5 cm) was recorded as a proxy for treatment\nefficacy. Data were analyzed with a generalized linear mixed model using\nTemplate Model Builder and a Poisson error distribution. The letters indicate\nsignificant differences (P < 0.05) according to a multiple comparison\ncorrected for false discovery using the Benjamini and Hochberg method (38).\n\n### Maize yield\n\nThere was an overall treatment effect on yield (Figs. 3 and S4; fresh cob\nweight, = 8.3, P = 0.04). At the end of the cropping season, plots that were\nrepeatedly treated with the EPN gel produced almost one additional ton of cobs\n(fresh weight [FW]) per hectare when compared with untreated control plots\n(6.6 \u00b1 0.2 SE t/ha vs. 5.7 \u00b1 0.2 t/ha; P = 0.03). Cypermethrin-treated plots\nyielded 6.1 \u00b1 0.2 t/ha, and plots treated with the EPN formulated in SPF\nproduced 6.0 \u00b1 0.2 t/ha, neither one being significantly different from the\ncontrol plots nor from the plots treated with the EPN gel.\n\nFig. 3.\n\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\n\nMaize yield. Estimated marginal means \u00b1 95% CI of fresh cob weight averaged\nfrom six fields with each five plots per treatment. At harvest, developed cobs\nfrom 30 plants in the center of each plot (n = 30 plots per treatment) were\nweighed. Data were analyzed with a linear model and a Gaussian error\ndistribution. The letters indicate significant differences (P < 0.05)\naccording to a multiple comparison corrected for false discovery using the\nBenjamini and Hochberg method (38).\n\nThe cobs themselves suffered little FAW damage (\u223c60% intact; \u223c35% little\ndamage [<5% damaged kernels]; <4% medium to heavy damage [>5% damaged\nkernels]), regardless of whether plants had been treated or not (Fig. S5). Cob\ndamage, as well as the number of cobs produced, was similar in all treatments\n(Figs. S5 and S6; cob damage: = 4.5, P = 0.21; number of cobs: = 4.5, P =\n0.21; number of fully developed cobs only: = 1.7, P = 0.65).\n\n## Discussion\n\nWe show that EPNs can be a promising alternative to insecticides for a more\nsustainable control of FAW. Unlike pesticides, EPNs pose no harm to farmers,\nconsumers, or livestock and are safe for the environment (18). Given the\ncomplex nature of the infection process by EPNs and their symbiotic bacteria\nin an infected insect, it is highly unlikely that FAW is able to develop\nresistance to EPNs (15, 39, 40). In contrast, several populations of FAW have\nreadily developed resistance to a variety of chemical insecticides (41) as\nwell as to Bacillus thuringiensis toxins expressed in transgenic maize\n(42\u201344). Another advantage of EPNs is that highly virulent strains can be\nlocally isolated and produced around the world (17, 33), avoiding the\nintroduction of nonnative organisms, reducing registration hurdles, and\nproviding the opportunity to use nonpatented native biological control agents\nwithout having to rely on external sources.\n\nImportantly, the EPN-gel application is expected to be cost-effective, since\nwe used doses of EPN across the whole season that were at least 3-fold lower\nthan what is commonly used to control belowground pests (0.4\u20130.6 vs. 2\u20134\nbillion EPN per ha (45, 46)). Based on our estimations, the amount of gel-\nformulated EPN used in this study over the season would cost a farmer \u223c54 or\n72 USD (representing three or four applications). Considering an average\nretail sale price of 354 USD per ton of maize grain in Rwanda (47), as well as\nthe additional ton of cobs produced in plots treated with the EPN-gel\nformulation when compared with control plots, the net benefit of our approach\ncould be of at least 70 USD (we estimated an additional ton of cobs to\nrepresent about 0.4 ton of grains).\n\nThe current study shows that repeated application of EPNs during the entire\nvegetative growing season of maize can consistently reduce plant damage. Both\nthe gel formulation and the surfactant formulation were as effective as the\ninsecticide cypermethrin. The three treatments showed a similar efficacy\nthroughout the first 4 weeks of the field trials (Fig. 1A; plants with up to\n10 leaves). After the fifth week, however, the EPN applied in the gel provided\nconsiderably better protection, indicating that it was the most effective\ntreatment on older plants (>6-week-old plants; >12 leaves). In contrast, the\ncypermethrin was found to be less effective after the fourth week and failed\nto prevent plant damage at 6 weeks (Fig. 1A). This lack of efficacy of the\ninsecticide could be due to heavy rains that followed the last two\napplications (in fields I, II, III, and IV), which may have washed off or\ndiluted the insecticide, whereas the more viscous gel or the commercial liquid\nEPN formulation containing surfactants may have remained better on the plants.\nThe fact that the insecticide did not work at the end of the season may also\nhave been an issue with dose. We consistently applied each treatment as a 2-mL\nspot-spray into the whorl of the plants. This volume of insecticide proved\neffective for younger plants during the first 4 weeks of the experiments, but\nit may have been less effective on older plants (>6-week-old plants). The\napplication covered the entire whorl area (2\u20133 youngest leaves) but not the\nlower leaves, which may have harbored some caterpillars in the case of the\nolder plants. In contrast, the gel treatment, which was applied similarly to\nthe insecticide, consistently prevented damage, and significantly reduced FAW\ninfestation, even on older plants (Figs. 1 and 2). The lower number of\ncaterpillars recovered on gel-treated plants may indicate that EPN migrated to\nlower leaves of the plants, where they could infest additional caterpillars.\nIndeed, we observed living EPN inside the shoot of dissected maize plants 2\nweeks after their application.\n\nImportantly, the trials were conducted at multiple field sites, characterized\nby different environmental conditions, landscapes, and pest pressures.\nFurthermore, the results are in agreement with our preliminary field trials\nconducted in 2020 (34), strongly suggesting that the EPN-gel formulation can\nbe effective in different agricultural contexts and under various\nenvironmental conditions. Still, the range of conditions that have been tested\nso far is limited, and it needs to be recognized that under different\nenvironmental and biotic pressures, the formulation may vary in its efficacy.\n\nThroughout the field trials, the plants were subject to high FAW infestation\nrates (i.e. more than one caterpillar per plant, with about 75% infested\nplants at \u201cHillside\u201d and 100% at \u201cStation\u201d and \u201cForest\u201d locations, in\nuntreated control plots). Plant damage was more severe 2 weeks after each\ntreatment than after 1 week regardless of the treatment (Fig. 1B). This\nimplies that FAW rapidly reinfested plants after each treatment. Hence, under\nsuch high pest pressures, a weekly application of the treatment may provide\neven better protection. This may be different under other climatic and\nagronomic conditions. Despite reinfestations, applying the EPN gel every two\nweeks resulted in a significant increase in yield, when compared with\nuntreated control plots (Fig. 3). The additional ton of maize produced readily\ncompensates for the estimated cost of the EPN and should be a major incentive\nfor African farmers to use this safer alternative instead of chemical\ninsecticides. Apart from a recent study (48), previous attempts in field\nconditions to control FAW with EPN applied with water or in combination with\nsurfactants have failed, indicating that the gel is key to the success of EPN\napplication against FAW (24, 34, 49, 50). Further effort should focus on fine-\ntuning the application frequency of EPN in accordance with local maize\nphenology, pest population dynamics, and environmental conditions. In\naddition, we believe that the efficacy of EPN could be increased by recent\ndevelopments with regards to their formulation. For instance, an innovative\nstrategy has been developed to coat individual EPN with nanoparticles of\ntitanium dioxide (51), which provides them with an increased tolerance to UV\nradiation (52).\n\nWe envision that local biocontrol companies could produce native EPN (17) and\nincorporate the EPN gel in large caulking gun-like devices specifically\ndesigned for smallholder farmers, allowing them to rapidly treat their maize\nplots with a simple and reusable technology. Another approach would be to\ntrain farmers in the mass production of EPN, for example, using black soldier\nfly larvae (53), so that they could use their own, on-farm produced,\nbiological control agents without relying on external sources. In this\ncontext, a simplified and self-sufficient method for farmers to produce EPN in\nvivo without the need for a laboratory was recently described (54). For large-\nscale commercial farming, high-precision machinery could be developed that\napplies low doses of EPN-containing gel on maize plants.\n\nTo conclude, the Rwandan field trials demonstrate over a complete maize\ngrowing season that the application of EPN can be an effective and safe\nalternative to synthetic insecticides in the fight against FAW and can\nincrease grain yields. The targeted gel application allowed us to use far\nlower numbers of EPN than what is normally applied to control belowground pest\ninsects, which should make the approach cost-effective for subsistence\nfarmers. Hence, the application of the gel-formulated EPN alone or in\ncombination with other Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices holds great\npromise for sustainable maize production and food security in Africa and\nbeyond.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Nematodes and formulations\n\nWe used the Rwandan EPN Steinernema carpocapsae (strain RW14-G-R3a-2) for this\nstudy (55), as we aim to only use local genotypes, and this particular strain\nhas been shown to be highly virulent against FAW (27). EPNs were reared in\nvivo on the last instar Galleria mellonella L. (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), as\ndescribed by White (56). Harvested nematodes were stored in the dark at a cool\ntemperature (12 \u00b0C) and used within 2 weeks postharvest.\n\nFour plant treatments were compared in this study: (i) untreated control, (ii)\napplication of EPN in a commercially available liquid SPF (e-nema GmbH,\nSchwentinental, Germany), (iii) application of EPN in a carboxymethyl\ncellulose (CMC) gel (34), and (iv) a positive control with the application of\nthe pyrethroid contact insecticide cypermethrin. We had previously shown that\nthe formulations by themselves (SPF and gel without EPN) did not affect FAW\nsurvival and that the application of EPN applied in just water was only\nmarginally effective (34). We, therefore, excluded these treatments from the\nhere-presented trials.\n\nThe SPF and CMC were dissolved in sterile water to a final concentration of\n0.11% (as recommended by the provider) and 3% (w/v), respectively. First, 42 g\nof CMC or 1.54 g of SPF were added to 1,300 mL of water and let to rest. The\nnext day, solutions were vigorously mixed with a whisk until fully dissolved.\nThen, 2.1 million EPN concentrated in 100 mL of water were added to the\nformulations and gently mixed. Using a binocular magnifier, we confirmed that\nthe formulations contained about 1,500 EPN/mL (for an application of \u223c3,000\nEPN per plant in a 2-mL spot-injection/spray). The cypermethrin (Supra EC, ETG\nInputs Ltd, India; 50 g a.i./L) was dissolved in water at 1.0 mL/L (\u223c0.1 mg\na.i. applied per plant in a 2-mL spot-spray). The prepared formulations were\nkept in cool boxes and used within 4 h.\n\n### Field sites\n\nThe experiments were carried out in six fields in Southern Rwanda at three\nlocations. Two fields (fields I and II) were located in an agricultural area\nat the Rwanda Agriculture and Animal Resources Development Board station in\nRubona, in the district of Huye (Location Station; GPS: 2\u00b029\u203200.6\u2032\u2032 S,\n29\u00b046\u203229.8\u2032\u2032 E; altitude 1,660 m.a.s.l.). Two fields (fields III and IV) were\nlocated close to the edge of a natural forest in the district of Huye\n(Location Forest; GPS: 2\u00b029\u203210.0\u2032\u2032 S, 29\u00b046\u203257.3\u2032\u2032 E; altitude 1,680\nm.a.s.l.). The last two fields (fields V and VI) were located in an\nagricultural terrace landscape on a hillside in the district of Nyamagabe\n(location Hillside; GPS: 2\u00b030\u203246.0\u2032\u2032 S, 29\u00b029\u203258.2\u2032\u2032 E; altitude 2,140\nm.a.s.l.). Throughout the duration of the experiment, the mean temperature\nduring the day (6 AM to 6 PM) at each location was 24.4 \u00b1 5.4, 24.1 \u00b1 5.6, and\n22.1 \u00b1 5.2 \u00b0C (mean \u00b1 SD) and was 17.6 \u00b1 2.7, 18.2 \u00b1 2.4, and 14.1 \u00b1 1.5 \u00b0C\n(mean \u00b1 SD) at night (6 PM to 6 AM), for Station, Forest, and Hillside,\nrespectively. In the same order, the average relative humidity recorded was\n76.1 \u00b1 18.1, 73.1 \u00b1 18.1, and 77.2 \u00b1 18.0% at these locations.\n\nFields at the Station and Forest locations measured \u223c16 by 42 m, while the\nfields at the Hillside location measured 5 by 110 m. The two fields at each\nlocation were separated by 5 to 10 m. They were planted on 2022 February 17 or\n18. The Rwandan maize hybrid RHMN 1,601 was sown every 30 cm in rows separated\nby 70 cm, representing about 47,000 plants/ha. Fields were fertilized twice\nwith NPK and urea at a rate of 300 or 100 kg/ha, respectively, once before\nsowing and a second time 4 weeks after sowing, in accordance with local\npractices. Fields were left untreated against insects until the beginning of\nthe experimental applications. The experiment was carried out between February\nand June 2022. We used three locations that were spatially separated\n(locations Forest and Hillside are about 30 km apart), which comprised\ndifferent environmental conditions (e.g. altitude, exposition, vegetation).\n\n### Experimental design\n\nEach of the 6 fields was divided into 20 plots comprising 6 rows of 12 to 16\nplants (\u223c72\u201396 plants per plot). Five plots per fields were attributed to one\nof the four treatments in a systematic block design (30 plots per treatment in\ntotal). The four treatments [(i) untreated; (ii) EPN in SPF; (iii) EPN in CMC\ngel; and (iv) cypermethrin] were prepared as described above. Treatments were\napplied as 2 mL spot-injections/sprays into the whorl of each plants using 20\nmL plastic syringes for the gel, or hand sprayers for the SPF and\ncypermethrin. The first application occurred when at least 30% of the plants\nwere showing signs of FAW damage (upper recommended action threshold (57)),\nand treatments were repeated every 2 weeks until flowering. In fields I, II,\nIII, and IV (\u201cRubona\u201d and Forest locations), the first application occurred 18\ndays postsowing (about 90% of plants damaged), when plants carried 4\u20135 leaves.\nIn total, four applications were performed in these fields (Rubona and Forest\nlocations). In fields V and VI, which were higher in altitude and infested at\na later stage, the first applications occurred 38 days postsowing (about 35%\nof plants damaged), when plants carried 7\u20139 leaves. In total, three\napplications were done in the Hillside fields, again until the maize started\nto flower. All plants within a plot were treated, but only the plants in the\nfour central rows (and at least 1.5 m away from the next plot) were used for\ndata collection.\n\n### Data collection\n\nSeven and 14 days after the first, second, and third applications, plant\ndamage was visually assessed for 40 plants in the center of each plot using\nthe Davis whorl damage scale (36), as described in Toepfer et al. (37).\nBriefly, the Davis scale is a top-view assessment, where only the damage to\nthe youngest leaves of the whorl is evaluated, where FAW caterpillars are\nmostly feeding. Hence, the damage recorded is noncumulative, as old damages\nlocated on lower leaves are not considered. The Davis whorl damage scale\nranges from \u201c0\u201d to \u201c9,\u201d whereby a fully intact whorl is attributed a score of\n\u201c0,\u201d while an almost totally destroyed whorl is attributed a score of \u201c9.\u201d\nMinor damages are represented by scores ranging from 1 to 3, while moderate or\nsevere damages by scores ranging from 4 to 6 or 7 to 9, respectively. In\ntotal, 40 plants from the four central rows of a plot were assessed at both 7\nand 14 days postapplications (200 plants per treatment and field). Plant\ndamage was evaluated by 2 assessors per plot (each evaluating 20 plants in 20\nplots per field). Plant damage was not assessed after the fourth application\n(fields I, II, III, and IV), as plants were too tall to visually inspect the\nwhorl without damaging the plants.\n\nFive days after the third application (second-to-last application in fields I,\nII, III, and IV; last application in fields V and VI), we also evaluated the\npresence of FAW caterpillars on the plants. For this, 10 specific plants\nwithin the 4 central rows of each plot were systematically destroyed to\ninspect the plants for caterpillars. The occurrence (yes/no) of young\ncaterpillars (shorter than 0.5 cm) was determined as a proxy for\nreinfestation, whereas the number of older caterpillars (longer than 0.5 cm)\nwas used as a proxy for treatment efficacy. The dissection of the plants and\nsearch for caterpillars were done by several assessors who had no knowledge of\nthe treatment being evaluated, but each assessed plants from all treatments.\n\nAt harvest, the number of fully developed and underdeveloped cobs from the 30\nremaining plants in the center of each plot was recorded. The fully developed\ncobs were collected and husked to assess cob damage, which was evaluated\nvisually using a \u201c0\u201d to \u201c3\u201d customized damage score. A score of \u201c0\u201d represents\nan intact cob, while scores of \u201c1,\u201d \u201c2,\u201d or \u201c3\u201d represent minor (<5% damaged\nkernels), moderate (5\u201320% damaged kernels), or severe (>20% damaged kernels)\ncob damage, respectively. The husked cobs from the 30 plants were then weighed\ntogether to estimate FW yield per plot and evaluate treatment effects on\nyield. For each plot, the assessments were carried out by 2 assessors who had\nno knowledge of the treatment being evaluated.\n\n### Data analyses\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using R version 4.2.1 (58). For each\nanalysis, fields were pooled in a single dataset and included in the\nstatistical models as fixed factors to account for the local variation among\nfield sites. The results presented are estimated marginal means from the\nmodels that show the average effect of the treatments across the different\nsites.\n\nPlant damage was analyzed using cumulative link mixed models (\u201cordinal\u201d\npackage (59)), followed by multiple comparisons (\u201cemmeans\u201d package (60))\ncorrected for false discovery using the Benjamini and Hochberg (38) method.\nThe damage score given to a plant was used as the response variable.\nTreatments, the application number (4 applications), as well as assessment\ntimes (7 or 14 days posttreatment) were used as fixed factors, plus their\ntriple interactions. Field number (six fields) and assessors were used as\nfixed factors, while plots and plants were used as random factors. The damage\nscore probabilities reported were calculated using the function\n\u201crating.emmeans\u201d (\u201cRVAideMemoire\u201d package (61)).\n\nCob damage was analyzed using cumulative link mixed models (\u201cordinal\u201d package\n(59)), similarly as plant damage. The damage score given to a cob was used as\nthe response variable, while treatments and field number (six fields) were\nused as fixed factors. Plots were used as a random factor.\n\nMaize yield was analyzed using a linear model with a Gaussian error\ndistribution. Yield per plot was used as the response variable, while\ntreatments and field numbers (six fields) were used as fixed factors. The\nnumber of caterpillars (longer than 0.5 cm) per plot, the total number of all\ncobs (underdeveloped + developed), as well as the number of developed cobs\nonly were analyzed similarly but using generalized mixed models with a Poisson\nerror distribution. Plots were included here as a random factor to correct for\noverdispersion. The occurrence of young caterpillars (shorter than 0.5 cm) per\nplant was analyzed similarly, with a binomial error distribution. Plots were\nused as a random factor to account for the repeated observations within a\nplot. The function \u201cglmmTMB\u201d (\u201cglmmTMB\u201d package (62)) was used to perform the\nmodels, while the function \u201cEffect\u201d (\u201ceffects\u201d package (63)) was used to\ncompute the model estimates presented in the figures and the Results section.\nA multiple comparison (\u201cemmeans\u201d package (60)) corrected for false discovery\nusing the Benjamini and Hochberg (38) method was performed to compare\ntreatments when they had a significant effect.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe authors would like to thank the Rwanda Agriculture and Animal Resource\nDevelopment Board for collaborative nematodes surveys and research, including\nbenefit sharing, material transfer agreements, and research permits, as well\nas the National Research and Innovation Fund (NRIF) of Rwanda with the support\nof the International Development Research Center (IDRC) under the National\nCouncil for Science and Technology of Rwanda (Sector Strategic Research Grant\nNCST-NRIF-IDRC/SSR-AGR/002/2021).
