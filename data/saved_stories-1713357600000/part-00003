A sharky looking bullet. The Hindu deity Ganesh. The Yin and Yang\nsign. All painstakingly selected and etched onto a microchip that measures\nabout an inch square. Each microscopic silicon doodle was the handiwork of\nengineers at Qualcomm Incorporated, a San Diego-based company that creates\nwireless technology-related products and services. The engineers slipped the\ndrawings into Qualcomm's Q1650 data decoder with care not to disturb any of\nthe chip's functions.\n\nThey were purposeless etchings, never meant to be uncovered.\n\nThese doodles, also known as silicon art, chip graffiti or chip art, and\ndozens others like it, are remnants of tech history\u2014from Silicon Valley's\ninfancy to the early 2000s\u2014when innovation was rapid fire and the tech still\nhad a very human touch. Engineers would add the sketches to their microchip\ndesigns in the techie equivalent of signing their artwork. They'd etch them on\nchips that may end up in your cellphone, laptop or calculator. They spent\nhours crafting them, even though they were frowned upon by those in the C\nSuite.\n\nThe existence of these doodles came to light decades ago, but social media is\ndiscovering them anew. And there is now a small but determined group of online\nhobbyists working to keep that history alive. They are still cataloguing the\nminiscule drawings \u2014 many smaller than the width of a human hair and can't be\nseen without a microscope.\n\nThese devotees post glossy videos of themselves shucking chips like oysters to\nsee their iridescent insides and the itsy bitsy sketches that may be hidden on\nthem. And they are eagerly saving them from the scrap heap.\n\n### \"We did it for ourselves\"\n\nRichard Kerr spent 15 years at Qualcomm starting in the mid 1980s.\n\nHis first doodle was inspired by his then-4-year-old son, Jesse Kerr, who\nwould ask to help with his chip designs.\n\n\"Well, he was into trucks at the time, so I designed a little '56 Chevy pickup\ntruck,\" Kerr said.\n\n> @evilmonkeyzdesignz I'm sure I'm pronouncing Viterbi incorrectly. This chip\n> is the Q1650C from Qualcomm, and is a Viterbi Decoder. It contains 7\n> #silicondoodle s. #ComponentsCloseUp #electronics #tech #technology #techtok\n> #electricalengineering \u266c I Really Want to Stay at Your House - Slowed +\n> Reverb - Lofitop\u00eda\n\nKerr only recently learned that others had discovered his decades-old doodles,\nfrom a friend who found a video on YouTube of the doodle packed Q1650 data\ndecoder. \"I was just blown away that somebody actually found it. And then it\nwas like, you know, total memory lane,\" he said.\n\n\"Mine is the shark bullet. Because my son (Jesse) was a body boarder at that\ntime. And so he decided that that was cool because he saw it on somebody's\nwetsuit,\" Kerr said.\n\nMany of the doodles came from engineers who weren't doing it for an audience.\n\n\"We did it for ourselves,\" said Willy McAllister, a retired electrical\nengineer who worked for more than a decade at Hewlett-Packard (HP) and helped\ncraft a chip with the sleek image of a cheetah on it. \"Nobody ever expected it\nto be cracked open 10 years later and marveled at. That was never the point.\"\n\nThe cheetah was picked as a visual representation for an HP project code named\nafter the world's fastest land animal.\n\nMcAllister's wife, Monica, sketched the cheetah, which was transferred to the\nchip. One of the big cat's spots is about 4 microns across \u2014 far thinner than\na sheet of paper.\n\n### Where's Waldo?\n\nSo how did this tiny art make its debut? The late research scientist Michael\nW. Davidson who ran the optical microscopy laboratory at Florida State\nUniversity for about decade until his retirement (and death) in 2015 had a\nmicroscope he used to photograph integrated circuits. One day in the late '90s\nwhile scanning a circuit, he found Waldo. Or at least, the etched outline of\nWaldo's head.\n\n\"Waldo is the first Silicon Creature that we discovered,\" reads the Silicon\nZoo website. \"And this led to an exhaustive search for more creatures and\nconstruction of the Silicon Zoo gallery.\"\n\nDavidson built the Silicon Zoo website to record his findings and he was\ntireless in his search for this art.\n\n\"At one point, I would say in '99 it was that the word was out in Tallahassee\nthat we were collecting (chips),\" said Eric Clark, who helped Davidson build\nthe site. \"We had a mountain of just computer parts and chips.\"\n\nThe site has catalogued dozens of doodles, many that wink to the function of\nthe integrated circuit, like an elephant on a memory chip, or a can o' worms\nnodding to the many problems a designer faced.\n\nBut there are still more out there.\n\n### Preserving bits of tech history\n\nThat's where people like Kenton Smith come in. Smith designs circuit boards\nand has long been fascinated by computers. He was examining chips a few years\nago when he found one smiling back up at him.\n\n\"I was just opening up a bunch of different types of chips,\" he said. \"And\neventually I came to one and it had a smiley face on it. And to find that was\none of the best feelings I've ever had in the world.\"\n\nThe discovery led him deep into the world of silicon scribbles, and he now\nbuys bulk chip lots on eBay and regularly posts videos showcasing his finds.\n\n\"One of the the driving forces, I think, to buying so much stuff on eBay is\nthat there's always this feeling that if I don't get it, I may never see that\nchip again,\" Smith said. \"And it's going to be recycled and we'll lose parts\nof our history.\"\n\nSmith posts about his finds across various social media, using his\n@Evilmonkeyzdesignz accounts that have hundreds of thousands of followers\namong them.\n\n> @evilmonkeyzdesignz check out this doodle of a dump truck \ud83d\ude9a on a chip!\n> #ComponentsCloseUp #electronics #technology #tech #techtok #dumptruck \u266c Uh\n> Oh Stinky but It's a Soft Lofi Beat - LLusion\n\nThis is a hobby that takes dedication. First you have to find the chips. Then\nyou have to snip them from their casings. Sometimes the chips shatter into\npieces. Sometimes acid is needed to eat away at decades old adhesive.\n\n\"I go to flea markets almost every week,\" said the man behind the @CPU_Duke\naccounts. \"I'm looking at boards and I get a feeling for this could be\ninteresting, this is an interesting brand. Could have a doodle on it. An\nEaster egg.\" He didn't want to use his real name for privacy reasons.\n\n### The microscopic art scene\n\nThe doodles represent an amusing a collision of technology and art.\n\nAlbert Folch, a professor at the University of Washington's bioengineering\ndepartment, is an expert in the field. He has long merged science and art in a\nprogram he calls BAIT (Bringing Art Into Technology). The walls in his office\nare covered in colorful microfluid artwork, which blend scientific photography\nwith artistic flourishes.\n\nFor Folch, the micro doodles are a joyful distraction.\n\n\"I think it's a lot of fun,\" he said. \"When I was designing chips myself, I\nnever did it. But I think it's something that if it had occurred to me, I\nprobably would have done it, just for fun.\"\n\n  * silicon doodles\n  * engineers\n\n### More Stories From NPR\n\n##### Technology\n\n#### As Iran attacked Israel, old and faked videos and images got millions of\nviews on X\n\n##### Technology\n\n#### To make sure grandmas like his don't get conned, he scams the scammers\n\n##### Politics\n\n#### Samsung gets $6.4 billion to build massive semiconductor plants in\ncentral Texas\n\n##### Technology\n\n#### The government announced winners of a contest to tell real voices from\ndeepfake audio\n\n##### National\n\n#### A Boeing whistleblower raises fresh concerns about the 787, and the FAA\ninvestigates\n\n##### Space\n\n#### NASA has been asked to create a time zone for the moon.
