All zoom levels are\nsupported, and the most complete version is only 300 kB gzipped. Its client-\nside rendering has been extensively profiled and tested on low-end decade-old\nphones, with no discernible lag.\n\nBy default, the map displays the 10,000 most populous cities added to\nOpenStreetMap. At the time of writing, this encompasses all cities and towns\nwith a population of at least 48,000:\n\n## Usage\n\nThere are two ways to use the map:\n\n  1. As a base map, replacing OpenStreetMap tiles\n  2. As an offline fallback for OpenStreetMap tiles\n\n### As a base map\n\nTo use tinyworldmap as a Leaflet base map, add the following to your head tag:\n\n    \n    \n    <script src=\"https://tinyworldmap.com/dist/tiny-world-all-10000.js\">\n\nThis script embeds all data necessary to display the map.\n\nThen, instead of adding a tile layer to the Leaflet map, use:\n\n    \n    \n    new L.GridLayer.TinyWorld().addTo(map)\n\nThe TinyWorld constructor accepts several options: backgroundColor,\ntextFillColor, borderStrokeColor, borderFillColor, borderWidth,\ntextStrokeColor (which helps separate the text from the rest),\ntextStrokeWidth, cityFont (e.g. \"12px Arial\"), countryFont, and dotColor.\n\nIf dotColor is specified, each city is marked with a dot. This enhances\nusability when using the stripped-down version of tinyworldmap that excludes\ncountry borders:\n\n### As a fallback map\n\nIn offline-first web applications, caching image-based maps at all zoom levels\nis impossible due to the vast number of tiles, with a combined size often in\nthe order of terabytes.\n\nThis repository provides a service worker to enable offline functionality for\nweb apps with maps.\n\nWhen this service worker is installed, the fallback map is preloaded. All\nvisited pages are cached, but the base map is excluded. While the server can\nbe reached, cached data is not used. When the user is offline, the website is\nserved from cache, and the service worker intercepts requests to the OSM tile\nserver, generating replacement tiles locally using tinyworldmap.\n\nBefore registering the service worker, first modify all sections in the\nservice worker marked IMPORTANT. Once registered, be sure to attribute\nOpenStreetMap and tinyworldmap in your tile layer as follows:\n\n    \n    \n    L.tileLayer('https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', { maxZoom: 19, attribution: '&copy; <a href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright\">OpenStreetMap</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tinyworldmap.com\">tinyworldmap</a>' }).addTo(map);\n\nTo see an example of a production application using tinyworldmap as a\nfallback, visit Hitchmap. Simply load the website in a browser supporting\nservice workers, wait for a while, turn off your internet, and reload. The web\napp should be functioning as normal, using the fallback map.\n\n## Tinier world maps\n\nThe complete map is 300K gzipped/694K uncompressed. For certain use cases,\nthis might still be too large.\n\n### No borders\n\ntiny-world-noborders-10000.js(on) contains all the data present in the\ncomplete version except for country borders and shorelines. This reduces the\ngzipped version by 100k and the uncompressed version by 200k.\n\nIn addition to its smaller size, the version without borders has the advantage\nthat all data included is precise. The country borders in the complete version\nare not exact at high zoom levels, which can look strange when overlaying\nshapes that match country borders and shorelines. In such cases, the version\nwithout borders often looks better.\n\nThis is the default styling:\n\n### No cities\n\nThere are two versions available without city labels: tiny-world-\nnocities.js(on) (which retains country labels) and tiny-world-borders.js(on)\n(which omits country labels). The city labels comprise 410K uncompressed and\n172K compressed.\n\n### Fewer cities\n\nFinally, for each file including city labels, there also exist versions\nfeaturing 2,000 cities and 4,000 cities. Simply substitute 10000 with 2000 or\n4000 in the filename.\n\nCities included| Population  \n---|---  \n10,000| > 48,000  \n4,000| > 137,000  \n2,000| > 287,000  \n  \n## Hire tinyworldmap\n\nIf you require a customized map (e.g. in more detail or in another language)\nor if you need assistance implementing offline functionality on your website,\nplease contact us at business@tinyworldmap.com.\n\n## Attribution\n\nLike OpenStreetMap data, tinyworldmap data is licensed under the ODBL, which\nnecessitates attribution.
