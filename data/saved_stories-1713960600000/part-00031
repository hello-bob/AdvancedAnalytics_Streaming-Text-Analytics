While we were building our first\niteration of the product, we found that websites and products had started\nbeing \u201cinfluenced\u201d heavily by Notion. Notion was a website with 2 colors -\nwhite and black. Again, we observed the same thing when Google rebranded their\nlogo to multiple colors. Suddenly everyone was aping their vibrant color\npalettes. I see this as an disadvantage, while companies bringing in the\ntrend; have a point of view. The companies aping the trend have no point of\nview on their customers. When a design or color palette becomes in trend and\nleaders who brought the pattern in, get all the attention and praise, the rest\nof us following the trend, subconsciously remind our users of the \u201cleading\u201d\ntrend setter. For multi colored logos aped by companies, for users like me, we\nare reminded of Google.\n\nFor small founder-led teams the advantage of getting influenced by a certain\ndesign aesthetic is that we minimize our \u201cbrain cycles\u201d and time spent on the\ntopic. Many times, small teams don\u2019t have an experienced designer on board. In\nthose cases, it does make all the sense to save time and money by being\ninfluenced by existing designs. A founder friend once told me that they bought\ndesign and code templates from the website and used it for as long as 4-5\nyears, till their design teams started to complain about the fact that their\ndesign choices were getting seriously impacted by the design template bought\nduring the initial stages of the startup.\n\n##\n\nDesign as a function of point of view\n\nIt is my opinion that designs should have a point of view on users. Take stock\nbroking apps for instance, they all feel \u201cclinical\u201d. By clinical, their apps\ndon't have a character of their own and don\u2019t extrude warmth and safety. When\nI set out to design a chatbot for a fintech women's only app, I wanted the app\nto have warmth and a sense of connection with the audience. I wanted it to\nhave a strong point of view on the customers. For me it meant that app should\nhave character and should keep in mind that it\u2019s designed to engage the\naudience, while evoking the strongest positive emotions for the product.\n\nDoes my thought process resonate with you ?

I wanted to build a product that was beautiful, functional and\nuseful. But well!! beautiful, functional and useful meant different things to\ndifferent user cohorts. For me, beautiful meant being joyously colorful and\nfunctional/useful meant that client should be able to reach the aha moment\nquickly. In line with our thought process that dashboards and apps in general\nshould have a point of view. We decided to make dashboard which had pastel\ncolors for different tasks on the Kanban board and project timelines. For us,\nit\u2019s was the matter of making the color palette and design, a reflection of\nour point of view - \u201cdashboards shouldn\u2019t be dry/\u201dclinical\u201d interfaces, they\nshould evoke positive emotion in the person\u201d. What do you think of our\napproach ?
