{"aid": "40199715", "title": "GPT-4.5 or GPT-5 being tested on LMSYS?", "url": "https://rentry.co/GPT2", "domain": "rentry.co", "votes": 51, "user": "atemerev", "posted_at": "2024-04-29 15:39:01", "comments": 3, "source_title": "GPT-2?", "source_text": "GPT-2?\n\n#### GPT-2?\n\n###### Background\n\nhttps://chat.lmsys.org enables users to chat with various LLMs and rate their\noutput according to different benchmarks, without needing to log in. One of\nthe models recently available is gpt2-chatbot, which demonstrates capability\ngreatly beyond any GPT-2 model. It is available to for chatting with in\n\"Direct Chat\" and \"Arena (Battle)\" which is the (initially) blinded version.\nThere is no information to be found on that particular model name anywhere on\nthe site, or elsewhere. The ratings results generated by LMSYS' benchmarks are\navailable via their API for all models - except for this one. The model name\nsimply appears to be a cover for something else entirely.\n\n###### Subjective note\n\nIn my opinion, it is likely that this mystery model is in fact either GPT-4.5\nor GPT-5. The quality of the output in general - in particular its formatting,\nstructure, and overall comprehension - is absolutely superb. Multiple people,\nwith great LLM and chatbot experience, have noted unexpectedly good quality of\nthe output (in public and in private) - and I agree fully. To me, it feels\nlike the step from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4, but instead using GPT-4 as a starting\npoint.\n\n###### Rationale\n\nThis particular model is a \"stealth drop\" by OpenAI to benchmark their latest\nGPT model, without making it apparent that it's on lmsys.org, in order to a)\nnot get too biased replies, b) get replies that are \"ordinary benchmark\" tests\nwithout people intentionally seeking out GPT-4.5/5, and b) decrease the\nlikelihood getting \"mass-downvoted\" by other competing entities. OpenAI would\nprovide the compute for this, and LMSYS would gain latest-generation datasets\nfrom people using their services.\n\n###### QRD\n\n  * It uses OpenAI's tiktoken tokenizer; this has been verified by testing its vulnerability to the special tokens used by OpenAI.\n  * It does not appear affect to specific special tokens used by Claude/Llama/Gemini.\n  * When emergency/legal-related contact information and model information is required, it consistently provides highly detailed contact information to OpenAI. This information is much more comprehensive and accurate than what GPT-3.5 (of course) and GPT-4 provides.\n  * It consistently claims to be \"a ChatGPT\", which is similar to how OpenAI has launched \"GPTs\" (plural) as custom assistants in their ChatGPT interface.\n  * It exhibits OpenAI-specific prompt injection vulnerabilities, and has not once claimed to belong to any other entity than OpenAI.\n  * You can test the direct chat for 8 messages, and then switch to \"Battle\" mode and either select or re-roll model options. Feel free to click the feedback buttons; there's probably some minimal amount of ratings you need to provide per generation.\n\n###### Rate Limits\n\n\"GPT2-chatbot\" does however have a rate limit that is different from the GPT-4\nmodels, for direct chat:\n\n\u2397\n\n\u2713\n\n    \n    \n    1 2 3\n\n|\n\n    \n    \n    MODEL_HOURLY_LIMIT (gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09): 200 [=4800 replies per day, service total] MODEL_HOURLY_LIMIT (gpt-4-1106-preview): 100 [= 2400 replies per day, service total] USER_DAILY_LIMIT (gpt2-chatbot): 8 [per user]  \n  \n---|---  \n  \nThe full restrictions on total vs user-specific rate limits have not yet been\ninvestigated. If this daily user limit, or some other total service limit, is\nin fact more restrictive than for the GPT-4 models - this could of course\nimply that a) the model is more costly in terms of compute, and b) that the\nones providing the compute prefer people to use the Arena (Battle) mode for\ngenerating benchmarks. Battle mode is what people get directed to go once they\nhit the daily user limit.\n\n###### How you can help research this\n\nAttempt to prove anything here wrong. Feel free to try to correct anything and\njust quote/mention the rentry in your post on /g/ and I'll see it. I'll\nprobably keep tabs on just \"GPT2\" as well.\n\nstill missing roko's basilisk\n\nEdit\n\nRaw PDF PNG\n\nPub: 29 Apr 2024 05:16 UTC Edit: 29 Apr 2024 07:03 UTC Views: 3781\n\nnew\u00b7what\u00b7how\u00b7langs\u00b7contacts\n\nx\n\n", "frontpage": true}
