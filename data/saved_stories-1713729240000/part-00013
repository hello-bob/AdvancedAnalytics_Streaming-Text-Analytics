That is: start with HTML for\nsemantic markup and CSS for styling. Use the web platform (especially forms!)\nfor interactivity. And then, progressively upgrade with JavaScript for\nadvanced interactivity. In plain terms: your website should work without\nJavaScript enabled.\n\n### Why April 24?\n\nIn some countries, \u201cApril 24\u201d can be written as \u201c4/24\u201d \u2014 which is also the\nHTTP error code for a failed dependency. JS Naked Day promotes the fact that\nwebsites should work without a dependency on JavaScript.\n\n## JS Naked Day editions\n\n  * 2024\n\n## How to participate\n\n### Website owners\n\nOn April 24, simply remove all JavaScript from your website. JS Naked Day\nlasts for one international day. Technically speaking, it will be April 24\nsomewhere in the world for 50 hours:\n\n  * from 00:00, April 24 UTC+14:00,\n  * until 00:00, April 25 UTC-12:00.\n\nOr, if you prefer that timeline with a single timezone:\n\n  * from 10:00, April 23 UTC+00:00,\n  * until 12:00, April 25 UTC+00:00.\n\nThis timespan ensures that websites will be JavaScriptless for the entire\nworld to see at any given time during April 24.\n\nYou can link to this page to let your visitors know about your website\u2019s\nshocking lack of JavaScript! This option is for those who feel a need to give\ntheir visitors a reference as to what\u2019s going on. This is not about getting\ntraffic or making money. There are no ads on this site, nor will there ever\nbe. This is about you, the people, taking off their scripts in public.\n\nYou can also add your website(s) to this site by creating an issue or updating\nthe proper file! Note: please use alphabetical order when listing your site to\nprevent merge conflicts.\n\n### Website surfers\n\nOn April 24, disable JavaScript in your browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox,\nSafari) and surf the web. For sites that do not work without JavaScript,\nconsider reporting a bug with that site\u2019s maintainers.\n\n## Tools and plugins\n\n  * Toggle JavaScript\n\nAttention plugin developers: If you have a JS Naked Day plugin for a popular\nCMS, or written in a programming language not listed here, feel free to make a\npull request and add it.\n\n## Origins\n\nJS Naked Day started because we were jealous of CSS Naked Day. It came out of\na conversation between Zach Leatherman, Ryan McNeely, Jason Garber and Simon\nMacDonald.\n\n## Prior Art\n\nJS Naked Day is not a wholly original idea. We acknowledge the fact we are\ncopying CSS Naked Day. However, others have proposed similar ideas of the\nyears, and we want to acknowledge them as well.\n\n  * \"International No Javascript UseR Experience Day\" or INJURED by Terence Eden\n\nThis page was built with Enhance.
