While the United States doesn\u2019t have clear laws surrounding the\nsubject or a defining line describing the legality of web scrapers, we can use\ncourt cases and the precedents they set, as a guide. There are ways to legally\nand ethically navigate the world of web scraping, and looking at the most\nimportant statutes and cases concerning the subject is the perfect place to\nstart.\n\n## Laws and Statutes to Consider\n\n### 1\\. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)\n\nThe CFAA is oftentimes the culprit when it comes to web scraping cases. It\nseems to be the first law that the defendant allegedly violates. We will\ndiscuss it in relation to these cases. The CFAA was adopted in 1986 to address\nhacking. It discusses the idea of authorized vs unauthorized access to a\nprotected computer or computer system. The CFAA makes knowingly accessing and\nobtaining information from a computer without authorization or by \u201cexceeding\nauthorized access\u201d a criminal offense. However, the main problem with the CFAA\nis that these terms were not defined within the scope of the statute itself.\nTherefore, the interpretation of the CFAA now relies on precedent set by the\nSupreme Court, namely in Van Buren v. The United States (referenced later in\nthis blog post.)\n\n### 2\\. California Penal Code Section 502\n\nCalifornia Penal Code Section 502 is often brought up in conjunction with the\nCFAA when it applies. This is because this penal code has similar implications\nto the CFAA. California Penal Code Section 502 describes the problems and\npunishments for accessing a computer, computer system or network without\nauthorization. This includes not only accessing data without permission, but\ncould also be altering data, assisting others in accessing data, or causing\ndamage to a computer system or network.\n\n### 3\\. Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act\nof 2003 (CAN-SPAM Act of 2003)\n\nThe CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 is not explicitly a web scraping law, but is\nreferenced later in this article, so I would like to offer a brief\nexplanation. For the purposes of this article, the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 deals\nprimarily with a large amount of commercial electronic mail being sent and\nwhether or not the information is materially false or misleading. When the\nheader or body of the text is materially false or misleading, or deceptive,\nthe emails violate the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003.\n\n## Court Cases that defined legality of scraping of public pages\n\n### 1\\. Craigslist Inc. v. 3taps Inc. et al (2013)\n\nIn this case, Craigslist v 3taps acknowledged that 3taps was able to scrape\nCraigslist as it was a publicly accessible website until Craigslist revoked\nauthorization with their cease-and-desist letter.\n\nThe most applicable part of Craigslist v. 3taps is 3taps motion to dismiss\nCraigslist's complaints of violation of the CFAA and California Penal Code\nSection 502. 3taps was scraping data from Craigslist and marketing a\nCraigslist API. Craigslist wanted to stop their scraping, so Craigslist sent\n3taps a cease and desist letter and blocked their IPs. The cease and desist\nletter even stated that they were no longer authorized to access their site\nand services \u201cfor any reason.\u201d Instead of stopping their scraping activity,\n3taps used new IPs and rotating proxies and continued scraping the site.\n\nAfter 3taps ignored the cease and desist letter and circumvented Craigslist\u2019s\nIP block, Craigslist sued 3taps citing many different claims, one of which was\nthat they violated the CFAA. 3taps refuted this claim and filed a motion to\ndismiss this claim on the grounds that Craigslist is a public website. While\nthis is true, Craigslist cited that the cease and desist letter was a clear\nrevocation of authorization, and 3taps continued to \u201cintentionally access(es)\na computer without authorization.\u201d 3taps claimed that being a public website,\nCraigslist cannot revoke authorization to access the site.\n\nUpon further investigation upon the wording and meaning of the statute (CFAA)\nthe court decided that Craigslist was able to revoke authorization and rested\nthis on the precedent set by LVRC Holdings LLC v. Brekka, a case which dealt\nwith a case of an employee accessing a computer and sending confidential\ninformation to himself to use in his own competing business. The court\nexplained that \u201c\u2018[t]he plain language of the statute . . . indicates that\n\u2018authorization\u2019 depends on actions taken by the employer.\u2019\u201d (Craigslist Inc.\nv. 3Taps inc, et al, 2013). In LVRC Holdings LLC v. Brekka, that was Brekka,\nand in Craigslist v. 3taps, it was Craigslist. Since Craigslist took the\naction of sending the cease and desist letter and blocking 3taps\u2019 IPs, this\nwas a valid way of revoking authorization, therefore 3taps violated the CFAA.\n\n### 2\\. Facebook, Inc v. Power Ventures, Inc (2016)\n\nAt first glance, it may appear that Power Ventures was able to perform actions\non Facebook\u2019s computer because they had consent from the users, after Facebook\nsent a cease-and-desist letter, Power Ventures was no longer authorized to\naccess Facebook\u2019s data. However this case doesn't affect scraping public\npages.\n\nFacebook sued Power Ventures for accessing Facebook user data and sending form\nmessages from Facebook\u2019s platform for a promotion they were running. Power\nallows Facebook users to spread the word about Power through different\nFacebook actions, which in turn sends an email to their friends from Facebook\nor sends internal Facebook messages, depending on the user\u2019s settings. After\nreceiving a cease-and-desist letter, and an IP block, Power found a way around\nit, and continued their promotion, acknowledging the use of Facebook data with\nauthorization. Facebook accused them of violating the Controlling the Assault\nof Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (\u201cCAN-SPAM\u201d), the\nComputer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (\u201cCFAA\u201d), and California Penal Code\nsection 502. The district court originally gave a summary judgment on all\nthree counts, but a later appeals court upheld some of these charges and\nreversed others. We will be mainly discussing the appeals case, as it is the\nmost recent verdict on this case.\n\nThe first claim to address is the violation of the Controlling the Assault of\nNon-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 or the \u201cCAN-SPAM\u201d Act.\nAlthough this promotion caused over 60,000 emails and an undetermined number\nof internal messages to be sent, a large number of messages itself doesn\u2019t\nviolate this act. Rather, the question is whether or not the header or body of\ntext is \u201cmaterially false\u201d or \u201cmaterially misleading.\u201d In this case, the\nexternal emails that are sent from Facebook are not materially false or\nmisleading. Under the statute's definition, who initiated the message matters.\nBecause of the course of actions, it could be Power and Facebook initiating\nthe message, one of which is correctly identified in the header and text body.\nAdditionally, Power users gave Power consent to share promotion through event\ninvitations. For the internal messages, they were also not misleading as Power\nwas identified, and Power users consented to the messages being sent.\nTherefore, the appeals court reversed the district court\u2019s decision regarding\nthe CAN-SPAM Act.\n\nThe next statute to consider is the CFAA. First, because of Power Ventures\nactions, Facebook suffered a loss of over $5,000 in employee time responding\nto this issue. Therefore, they have a private right to action under the CFAA\nfor a loss this substantial. When it comes to accessing Facebook\u2019s computers,\nat first it could be argued that Power was able to do so because Power users\n(also Facebook users) gave Power permission to access their Facebook\ninformation, therefore Power was not violating the CFAA. However, then\nFacebook sent the cease and desist letter that clearly revoked any\nauthorization or permission they had to access Facebook computers. When they\nignored the cease and desist letter and continued their campaign, Power\nVentures violated the CFAA. The appeals court affirmed the district court\u2019s\ndecision in this case that Power Ventures violated the CFAA.Lastly, we must\nreview the decision on the California Penal Code section 502. Section 502\naddresses liability if a party \u201c\u2018[k]nowingly accesses and without permission\ntakes, copies, or makes use of any data from a computer...\u2019\u201d (Facebook Inc v.\nPower Ventures Inc, DBA and Steven Suraj Vachani, 2016) or computer network.\nThe same explanation from the CFAA in the preceding paragraph applies to this\ncase meaning the appeals court affirmed the district court\u2019s decision in this\ncase.\n\n### 3\\. HiQ Labs, Inc v. LinkedIn Corporation (2022)\n\nHiQ Labs v. LinkedIn case highlights that scraping data that is publicly\naccessible is legal and not in violation of the CFAA.\n\nLinkedIn sent hiQ Labs a cease-and-desist letter for scraping public profiles\non LinkedIn, and said that if they continue to do so, it will violate the\nComputer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). They also said that they blocked hiQ Labs\nIPs. HiQ Labs then sought a preliminary injunction. It made it all the way to\nthe U.S. Supreme Court (SCOTUS), but was sent back to the Ninth circuit court\nwho, after re-examining the case, asserted their original claim, granting hiQ\nLabs the preliminary injunction. They deemed this injunction appropriate as\nthe IP block significantly harmed their business, they did not violate the\nCFAA or other laws, and it was found that public interest was in favor of hiQ\nLabs. They asserted that hiQ Labs did not violate the CFAA because all of\nthese LinkedIn profiles were publicly accessible. It\u2019s also important to note\nthat LinkedIn did not have ownership of this information. When it comes to the\nCFAA and web scraping, authorization is not required if the information is\npublicly accessible.\n\nThe idea that no authorization is required for publicly accessible data under\nthe CFAA is in reference to a precedent set by the SCOTUS case Van Buren v.\nThe United States. In Van Buren v. The United States, the CFAA is clarified in\nreference to the \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d clause. This provision is in\nreference to files that one may not have access to; if they were to obtain\nsaid information, it would \u201cexceed authorized access\u201d and violate the CFAA.\n\nVan Buren v. The United States also brings up a gates-up-or-down inquiry,\nwhich is applicable to this case. This inquiry discusses authorized. If\nauthorization is required and has been given, the gates are up, granting\naccess. If authorization is required and has not been given, gates are down,\nblocking access. However, in this case, as public websites don\u2019t limit access,\nauthorization is not required, so there is no gate to operate, rendering the\nauthorization not applicable (Van Buren v United States, 2021).\n\n### 4\\. Meta Platforms, Inc v. Bright Data Ltd. (2024)\n\nMeta Platforms v Bright Data case exemplifies that logged-off scraping of\npublicly accessible data is legal and did not violate Meta\u2019s Terms of Service.\n\nMeta v. Bright Data was an interesting web-scraping case that Meta brought\nagainst Bright Data. It was unique because while Bright Data was motioning for\nsummary judgment, Meta was cross-motioning for partial summary judgment for\nbreach of contract and tortious interference with contract.\n\nBright Data collects and sells datasets through web scraping and offers the\nuse of proxies to their customers as well. Two of the sites scraped were\nFacebook and Instagram, 2 social media sites, both of which are owned by Meta.\nMeta alleges that scraping their sites and selling the information is against\nboth Facebook and Instagram policies and that Brigh tData refused to stop\ntheir scraping activity when Meta demanded them to.\n\nOne of the main issues in this case rests on the term \u201cuser\u201d and,\nconsequently, \u201cuse.\u201d Meta alleges that anyone who accesses their site \u201cuses\u201d\ntheir data under their contract, while Bright Data alleged that a \u201cuser\u201d would\nhave to be someone who has an account and that until that account is created,\nthey wouldn\u2019t be bound by the terms. It is also important to note that Bright\nData had Facebook and Instagram accounts used for marketing purposes when the\noriginal lawsuit was brought up. However, as of December 4th, 2023 (about two\nmonths before this decision), Bright Data terminated all Facebook and\nInstagram accounts. Aside from the accounts that they had, they claim that all\ninformation was from logged-off scraping, meaning that all data scraped was\npublic and not protected by a password. They say that because of this, it had\nnothing to do with their marketing accounts and they were therefore not bound\nby the terms and conditions as they were not \u201cusers.\u201d This is further\nsupported by a change in Facebook\u2019s terms and conditions. In 2009, there was a\nclause that said: \u201c\u2018accessing or using our website . . . signif[ies] that you\n. . . agree to be bound by these Terms . . ., whether or not you are a\nregistered member of Facebook.\u2019\u201d(Meta Platforms, Inc. v. Bright Data Ltd.,\n2024) This clause has since been deleted. This clause clarifies that Bright\nData would be bound in 2009. However, because this clause has since been\ndeleted, Meta seems to have knowingly changed their terms to exclude those who\naccess the website, or visitors, as users.\n\nAdditionally, Bright Data holds that logged-off scraping couldn\u2019t be bound to\nthe terms and conditions as these terms are accessible only when you\u2019re\nsigning up for an account and are only hyperlinked. Therefore, by being on the\npublicly accessible site, you would neither come across the terms and\nconditions, nor be asked to agree to them. Meta also contends that Bright Data\ncircumvented their access restrictions by various methods including the use of\ntechnology for CAPTCHA solving. However, the use of automation for CAPTCHA\nsolving has been proven different from accessing password protected content by\nthis court in the earlier case HiQ Labs v. LinkedIn. Despite Meta\u2019s best\nefforts, they were unable to meet their burden of proof that Bright Data\nscraped logged-in data.\n\nUpon examination of the terms, there was some ambiguity and because of this,\nboth Meta and Bright Data were allowed to submit extrinsic evidence. Meta\nchose to not submit extrinsic evidence saying their terms were not ambiguous.\nIn contrast, Bright Data referenced the 2009 change in terms, a 2009 statement\nby a Facebook employee that stated \u201c\u2018A putative Facebook user cannot become an\nactual Facebook user unless and until they have clicked through the\nregistration page where they acknowledge they have read and agreed to\nFacebook's terms of use\u2019\u201d(Meta Platforms, Inc. v. Bright Data Ltd., 2024).,\nand a quote from the help center saying \u201c\u2018You have to create a Facebook\naccount in order to use Facebook.\u2019\u201d (Meta Platforms, Inc. v. Bright Data Ltd.,\n2024)\n\nAfter examination of the terms of both Facebook and Instagram, the course of\nevents between Meta and Bright Data, extrinsic evidence, and that logged-out\nscraping is not prohibited by the terms and conditions, Meta\u2019s motion for\npartial summary judgment was denied. Meanwhile, as logged-off scraping was not\nprohibited by the terms the court rules in favor of Bright Data and grants\ntheir summary judgment on breach of contract. After this, the claim of\ntortious interference against Bright Data still stood. However, Meta has since\ndropped the case.\n\n## Legality of Web Scraping at SerpApi\n\nHere at SerpApi, we only perform web scraping on search engines providing\npublicly available data.
