On the other hand, every placement of a 3\u00d733\u00d73 square covers exactly 66\n> colored cells, and that of a 2\u00d722\u00d72 square covers either 22 or 44 colored\n> cells. This means any nonoverlapping placement of 2\u00d722\u00d72 and 3\u00d733\u00d73 squares\n> can only cover an even number of colored cells, and therefore cannot cover\n> all colored cells on the grid.\n\nGeneralizing this result, the question \"For which nn can an n\u00d7nn\u00d7n square be\ntiled with 2\u00d722\u00d72 and 3\u00d733\u00d73 squares?\" can be fully answered:\n\n>   * If nn is even, it can be fully tiled with 2\u00d722\u00d72 squares.\n>   * If nn is a multiple of 33, it can be fully tiled with 3\u00d733\u00d73 squares.\n>   * If nn is 1mod61mod6, the even-odd argument on the same coloring pattern\n> applies, and therefore a tiling does not exist.\n>   * If nn is 5mod65mod6, the same argument can be made using the same\n> pattern but shifted right by one column (so that the leftmost column is not\n> colored). This creates a coloring with the exact same property.

However this is not a sufficient condition. Consider trying to tile a\n4x4 square with the three tiles (one of size 3x3, one of size 2x3 and one of\nsize 1x1). Even though 4x4=16 and 3x3+2x3+1x1=16, you can\u2019t tile the 4x4\nsquare with these three tiles.\n\n\u2013 Will Octagon Gibson\n\n8 hours ago\n\n  * This does not provide an answer to the question.
