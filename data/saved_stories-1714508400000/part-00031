There are major downsides (difficulty of bootstrapping and reduced\nanonymity) but it gives a way to combat this. If a significant number of the\nusers you have invited are bots you get your invite privileges revoked (or you\nget banned). It creates a chain of accountability and you can ban as high as\nnecessary to severe the corrupted branch.\n\n    * @itslilith\n\nlink\n\n1\u202217 minutes ago\n\nThis feels like implementing a certificate authority system for individual\nusers I wonder if it is feasible to use of a web of trust that is less\ncumbersome and more resilient than the original GnuPG WoT, that could do the\nsame thing. Instead of hierarchical introductions you have trusted users vouch\nfor you not being a bot (one could even think about extending this to general\nrule abidance, turning it into a full on reputation system). It would feel\npretty bad to loose an account, just because whoever invited you later also\ninvited a bunch of bots/untrustworthy users\n\n  * TigrisMorte\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\n54\u20224 hours ago\n\nThey lost so many users they needed the \u201cengagement\u201d numbers for the IPO so\nthey opened the flood gate.

Manifestos about a better way of\nlife, and creative personal websites have been replaced with vapid social\nstatus posts in bland bootstrap layouts that double as data collection\nschemes. Technology that empowers people has been replaced with technology to\nrestrict people. Bots masquerading as people is just the cherry on the sundae,\nthe inevitable outcome of having created such a monoculture, a place where\nlarge orchards of content are so easy to pollute. The modern Internet ducking\nsucks, it has been ruined by people.\n\n    * @arymandias@feddit.de\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\n5\u20222 hours ago\n\nReading the Wikipedia it seems quite unlikely, but then again maybe it\u2019s also\nwritten by a bot.\n\n    * @DahGangalang@infosec.pub\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\n21\u20223 hours ago\n\nYeah, even if we\u2019re not quite \u201cthere\u201d yet, it feels like we\u2019re at least moving\nin that direction\n\n  * @spujb@lemmy.cafe\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\nEnglish\n\n5\u20222 hours ago\n\nhas someone reached out to u/A-Seashell to let them know they\u2019ll never get an\nanswer :\u2019(\n\n  * Anti-Face Weapon\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\n115\u20225 hours ago\n\nMy understanding of how this works is that that left one is real accounts\nmaking real comments, at least in the majority.\n\nThen when the link gets reposted, either by a bot or naturally, potentially\ndepending on the title, the bots scrape the old comments and post them.\n\nIt\u2019s content farming. And Reddit is probably okay with this.\n\n    * @moriquende@lemmy.world\n\nlink\n\nfedilink\n\n115\u20225 hours ago\n\nThe right one is the \u201creal\u201d accounts.
