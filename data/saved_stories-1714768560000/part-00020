The polite call centre worker on the line\nasks for you by name, and gives the name of your bank. They say they're\ncalling from your bank's fraud department.\n\n\"Yeah, right!\" You think. Obvious scam, isn't it? You tell the caller to do\nunmentionable things to a goat. They sigh.\n\n\"I can assure you I'm calling from Chase bank. I understand you're sceptical.\nI'll send a push notification through the app so you can see this is a genuine\ncall.\"\n\nYour phone buzzes. You tap the notification and this pops up on screen:\n\nThis is obviously a genuine caller! This is a genuine pop-up, from the genuine\napp, which is protected by your genuine fingerprint. You tap the \"Yes\" button.\n\nWhy wouldn't you? The caller knows your name and bank and they have sent you\nan in-app notification. Surely that can only be done by the bank. Right?\n\nRight!\n\nThis is a genuine notification. It was sent by the bank.\n\nYou proceed to do as the fraud department asks. You give them more details.\nYou move your money into a safe account. You're told you'll hear from them in\nthe morning.\n\nCongratulations. You just got played. Scammers have stolen your life savings.\n\n## How the scam works\n\nThis is reasonably sophisticated, and it is easy to see why people fall for\nit.\n\n  1. The scammer calls you up. They keep you on the phone while...\n  2. The scammer's accomplice calls your bank. They pretend to be you. So...\n  3. The bank sends you an in-app alert.\n  4. You confirm the alert.\n  5. The scammer on the phone to your bank now has control of your account.\n\nLook closer at what that pop is actually asking you to confirm.\n\n> We need to check it is you on the phone to us.\n\nIt isn't saying \"This is us calling you - it is quite the opposite!\n\nThis pop-up is a security disaster. It should say something like:\n\n> Did you call us? If someone has called you claiming to be from us hang up\n> now [Yes, I am calling Chase] - [No, someone called me]\n\nI dare say most people would fall for this. Oh, not you! You're far too clever\nand sceptical. You'd hang up and call the number on your card. You'd spend a\nterrifying 30 minute wait on hold to the fraud department, while hoping\nfraudsters haven't already drained your account.\n\nBut even if you were constantly packet sniffing the Internet connection on\nyour phone, you'd see that this was a genuine pop-up from your genuine app.\nWould that bypass your defences? I reckon so.\n\nCriminals are getting increasingly good at this. Banks are letting down\ncustomers by having vaguely worded security pop-up which they know their\ncustomers don't read properly.\n\nAnd, yes, customers can sometimes be a little gullible. But it is hard to be\nconstantly on the defensive.\n\n## Further reading\n\nYou can read the original story from the victim on Reddit.
