Part 2 is mostly about\nhow this process feels and what could be done differently\u2014and better.\n\nI thought we were so smart and so well-prepared: Bess and I knew that, if I\u2019m\nto stay alive, I\u2019d need to swiftly pivot to another clinical trial the moment\npetosemtamab failed to control the eight squamous cell carcinoma tumors in my\nneck and lungs. Bess wrote the definitive guide on how to do just that; I\u2019ve\nwritten about the extensive work we did between November and January,\nestablishing care at additional hospital systems and even flying out to MD\nAnderson (MDA) in Houston, to make sure that we\u2019d be ready\u2014just like the\nFrench were ready to confront the Germans at the Maginot Line^[1] in 1940. In\npursuit of that \u201cstaying alive\u201d goal, we did so much.^[2]\n\nOn Mar. 13, we leapt into action: the tumors in my neck had grown by 20% since\nJanuary! We knew that failing to plan is planning to fail, and we\u2019d not made\nthat mistake. An oncologist at MDA had been enthusiastic about a Seagen\nclinical trial of an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) called PDL1V\u2014she cited\nPDL1V as showing great results in head and neck cancers.^[3] Furthermore, Dr.\nSacco, my oncologist at UCSD who dosed me with petosemtamab, had said that\nUCSD would be getting the Seagen ADC trial in January. Consequently, Bess and\nI thought we had two good, viable sites for the Seagen trial and felt\nreassured because of the double coverage. We wouldn\u2019t have to repeat the mad\nscramble of last July and August. We\u2019re pros now, anticipating the pitfalls\nthat made the first search for a trial so trying and so desperate. We also\nplanned for me to get a single dose of chemo to potentially retard tumor\ngrowth between trials. We were prepared.\n\nAt least, we thought we were prepared.\n\nAll of our plans fell apart, and this is the tale of woe of those plans\nfalling apart, and how we tried to maximize the probability of me not dying\nwithin a month or two by framing and executing new plans in a fearsome rush\nagainst time. Given how fast the cancer has progressed, I may be compromised\nbefore a new clinical-trial drug has time to work.\n\nIn mid-March\u2014 the same week we discovered the petosemtamab had stopped\nworking\u2014we also learned that implementation of the Seagen trial at UCSD had\nbeen delayed into mid-April. Unfortunate, we thought, but that\u2019s why we had\nbackup: I messaged MDA in an attempt to get into their Seagen trial. The\noncologist I\u2019d met was on vacation, however, and wouldn\u2019t be back until the\nweek of March 25. People go on vacation all the time\u2014wasn\u2019t there someone else\nI could talk to? I asked if anyone was covering for her, but apparently no one\nwas, and the nurse I corresponded with said I\u2019d have to fly out to see whether\nMDA might have an appropriate trial, and trial slot.\n\nI was confused, because I\u2019d flown to Houston in November to establish care at\nMDA to avoid having to scramble in exactly this scenario. Plus, flying is\nexpensive and draining, and I was feeling abysmal. Although I\u2019d been told the\nprevious in-person trip would grant me future remote telemedicine visits, I\ncouldn\u2019t get an appointment. Given how time sensitive cancer can be, saying:\n\u201cWait two weeks, and we\u2019ll see\u201d seems not ideal to me. I learned that the MDA\nphase 1 trial team was considered a different department than the oncologist\nwhich I\u2019d seen, and so they (again) wanted me to fly out for basic screening.\nMaybe the oncologist I\u2019d seen could act as a liaison to find out if the Seagen\ntrial had available slots worth traveling to MDA for, but she was unreachable.\n\nBess and I have learned not to wait. The healthcare system often moves slowly,\nand it\u2019s good to be agentic. Insufficient agency is how people die while\nwaiting for some indifferent bureaucrat to get back to them, or for some other\nbureaucratic process to spin up before the rapidly dividing cancer cells spin\nsomeone down.\n\nWe began contacting the oncologists we\u2019d met with during the first search. One\noncologist warned us that the Seagen trial was so bad that she\u2019d closed it\nearly, because the ADC didn\u2019t work for long and caused so many side effects.\nWhat? We were confused. How could we be getting such different views from the\noncologist at MDA versus the oncologist whose hospital had closed the trial\nearly?\n\nNothing made sense. In our efforts to triangulate (quadrangulate? Octa-\nangulate? We were talking to a lot of people), we eventually met an oncologist\nat the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle (\u201cFred Hutch\u201d). But\nwhen he referenced the NCT for what we thought of as \u201cthe Seagen trial\u201d from\nhim, it turned out to be a different trial than PDL1V. That trial was for\n\u201cSGNTV-001,\u201d not PDL1V! Bess and I thought we were pursuing one Seagen ADC\ntrial when there were (and are) actually two\u2014or really more than two:\n\n* \u201cSGNTV\u201d is Efficacy and Safety Study of Tisotumab Vedotin for Patients With Solid Tumors (innovaTV 207).\n\n* But PDL1V is \u201cA Study of SGN-PDL1V in Advanced Solid Tumors.\u201d\n\n* I\u2019m jumping ahead, but there is at least one other possible Seagen trial, of sigvotatug vedotin (SGN-B6A), that is recruiting and for which I seem to be qualified.\n\nIt turns out that saying \u201cI\u2019m looking for the Seagen head and neck cancer ADC\ntrial\u201d is like saying \u201cI\u2019m looking for food.\u201d What sort of food, in what\nquantity, for how many people, at what cost? We didn\u2019t realize this, and it\ntook us an embarrassingly time to understand it. We weren\u2019t the only ones who\nwere confused. The PIs at various sites didn\u2019t seem to realize that there were\nmultiple Seagen trials, because no one site had more than a single Seagen\ntrial. Since most PIs don\u2019t refer to their trials by NCT, but by the drug\ncompany sponsoring the trial, discussing \u201cThe Seagen Trial,\u201d meant that both\nwe and the PIs could have what seemed to be a successful conversation about\ntwo different Seagen trials. Both trials are ADC trials, making them even more\neasily confused.\n\nSo the oncologist who\u2019d closed the trial early had been talking about\nSGNTV\u2014Tisotumab Vedotin. Fred Hutch in Seattle had SGNTV slots. UCSD, we found\nout, was supposed to open an SGNTV site. MDA had PDL1V but not SGNTV. The\noncologist at Fred Hutch also said that SGNTV had successfully shrunk a lot of\ntumors (good), that it had proved durable in some but not a lot of patients\n(not as good), and that the side effect profile was pretty bad, with a fair\nnumber of patients having to exit the trial because of ocular side effects in\nparticular.\n\nMoreover, both SGNTV and PDL1V have peculiar rules that exclude a lot of\npatients from clinical trials: patients can have at most two previous systemic\nlines of therapy in the recurrent/metastatic setting. Last summer and early\nfall, I received pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and two cycles of chemotherapy,\nwhich consisted of carboplatin and paclitaxel. Then I got petosemtamab. The\npembro and chemo were received at the same time, and can, if looked at\nproperly, be considered part of the same line of therapy. If I was given\nSGNTV, I\u2019d have three systemic lines of therapy and be ineligible for PDL1V.\nAnd the same in reverse. Sophie\u2019s Choice!\n\nStill, the oncologist at Fred Hutch said that I\u2019m eligible for SGNTV, he had a\nslot for SGNTV, and he thought SGNTV a reasonable choice. Without knowing\nwhether I might be able to get a PDL1V slot at MDA, or somewhere else, Bess\nand I debated and elected to go ahead and do SGNTV, risking the ocular and\nother side effects. But then we heard back from him the next day: \u201cYou\u2019re over\nthe limit on lines of therapy.\u201d But the rules on clinicaltrials.gov said \u201cno\nmore than 2,\u201d which is exactly what I\u2019d had. That confused us, so we asked for\nmore detail, and he replied that SGNTV \u201cwill not allow more than 1 line of\ntreatment in the metastatic setting, that is why you are not eligible, its\nindependent of how we count the chemo.\u201d Huh? I\u2019d read the clinicaltrials.gov\nrequirements.\n\nMuch later, we learned from Dr. Sacco that there are rules upon rules:\ndifferent \u201carms\u201d of the SGNTV trial have different eligibility criteria. I was\neligible for Arm C, I think, but not most of the other arms. Still, we were\ninterested to see if anyone else interpreted the rules differently, which, as\nwe learned during the first search back in July, happens routinely. We sought\nSGNTV at sites in Oregon and Stanford. One said the SGNTV is closed, and the\nother said I\u2019m not eligible due to limits on prior lines of therapy,\nconfirming that updates to the rules don\u2019t have to be updated on\nClinicalTrials.gov. Around the same time, someone helped us to learn that the\nUCSD trial would either not open or not open in time for it to be relevant for\nme.\n\nSo we gave up on SGNTV and wheeled around to seek PDL1V.^[4] You may recall\nthat I mentioned wanting to get a single dose of chemo in as a bridge between\ntrials, to prevent the tumors from ballooning or killing me. I didn\u2019t get that\nchemo dose immediately, however, because a lot of drug companies are bizarrely\nfinicky about things like interpreting the meaning of lines of therapy, and I\ndidn\u2019t want to inadvertently render myself ineligible for good trials. If\nyou\u2019re already exhausted by the barrage of issues and considerations, don\u2019t be\ndiscouraged: you\u2019re not alone. I\u2019m exhausted by this process, and for me the\nwrong answer is fatal. I\u2019ve barely written between Mar. 18 and now because the\nclinical-trial process, combined with increasing fatigue and pain, have\noccupied almost all of my time, attention, and energy. I\u2019ve done tiny amounts\nof Twitter between phone calls and research bouts, but I\u2019ve not managed\nanything substantive because of my focus being stolen. Bess has been similarly\nquiet, for similar reasons, and because she\u2019s begun working full-time in the\nemergency room again.\n\nAnyway, to return to the PDL1V issue, two of the more proximate sites were\navailable under the same umbrella organization, the START Center for Cancer\nCare: one site in San Antonio, the other in Salt Lake City.^[5] Both START\nsites were incredibly responsive: both nearly immediately confirmed that they\nwould host PDL1V, pre-screened me for eligibility, and started the paperwork\nprocess (\u201cthe paperwork process\u201d is frustrating but universal, in our\nexperience so far). Neither START site would make me fly out before the\nrequired in-person consent. I wouldn\u2019t have to travel until they\u2019d officially\nreserved and confirmed a spot; START said that making patients fly out just\nfor screening is unnecessarily cruel to patients who are already overwhelmed\nand suffering: a kindness that did not go unnoticed. We were told that the new\narm of PDL1V\u2014the \u201cc\u201d arm\u2014would likely be open in mid-April. I think we learned\nthat sometime in the Mar. 20 \u2013 26 timeframe, but I don\u2019t have the energy now\nto search through dozens of notes and hundreds of disparate emails for answers\nthat aren\u2019t of fundamental importance to the story.\n\nWhile this was going on\u2014I\u2019m telling the story somewhat out of order, because\nmaintaining the precise order would make it even more exhaustingly minute than\nit already is\u2014we were also making appointments with some of the other\noncologists and hospital systems. A surprising one is Hackensack Hospital,\nwhich is part of Meridian Health. If you have head and neck cancer and live in\nthe northeast, it turns out that there are three essential hospital systems.\nTwo are obvious: Memorial-Sloan Kettering (MSK) in New York City and Dana\nFarber in Boston, and our experiences with both have been fantastic (not\nbecause there is less bureaucracy, but because the doctors we dealt with there\nwere not completely beholden to it). The third is Hackensack, whose quality\nappears to rest primarily on the capabilities of Dr. Gutierrez, who is\ninvested in choosing a few, but quality, trials, accepts initial telemedicine\nvisits, and seems to understand that speed matters in rapidly progressing\ndiseases. I\u2019d not have guessed Hackensack Hospital would be a great place for\nhead and neck cancer clinical trials, and I would\u2019ve been wrong. From Dr.\nGutierrez at Hackensack, we learned about an immunotherapy trial called\nBGB-A3055 (I didn\u2019t invent the naming nomenclature). BGB-A3055 has no lines-\nof-treatment restrictions and an arm of it that includes tislelizumab (another\npembro-like antibody) is supposed to open in April.\n\nSo BGB-A3055 was another possibility, although I think it just recently\nentered phase 1b and there\u2019s little or no published data on it. Around the\ntime we were learning about BGB-A3055 from Dr. Gutierrez, we also met an\noncologist named Dr. Weight at Sarah Cannon in Denver. Dr. Weight told us\nabout a trial for ABBV-400, another ADC that uses a different mechanism than\nPDL1V, and said that it has also shown some success in some head and neck\npatients. A downside of all these phase 1b studies is that there\u2019s little\npublished data, which makes comparisons difficult. Oncologists almost never\ngive numbers: \u201cWe dosed 10 patients, and the disease control rate in phase 1a\nwas 50%.\u201d Instead, they\u2019ll be vague, but they\u2019ll also indicate why they think\ntheir top trials are their top trials. Strangely\u2014or perhaps not strangely\u2014we\nfound more preliminary data was provided to investors by the drug companies in\ninvestor reports, than was given to oncologists or patients. We shared slides\nfrom investor pitches with oncologists, who were also surprised to see even\nearly spider graphs of data that hadn\u2019t crossed their desk.^[6]\n\nBess and I spent a lot of time debating the sometimes gnomic descriptions of\nvarious trials\u2014it\u2019s like listening to people talk about wines: is \u201coaky\u201d good\nwhile \u201ctannic\u201d is bad? \u201cMineral forward\u201d versus \u201cfruit notes?\u201d I have no idea.\nWe had to decide between oncologists who have seen \u201csome responses\u201d in head\nand neck, versus the ones who have seen \u201cgood responses.\u201d Or the others who\nhave seen \u201csome activity.\u201d\n\nWe also had to figure out what might available. BGB-3055 would open in\nApril\u2014around the same time as PDL1V. There was also a site called NEXT in\nDallas that was offering the trial. ABBV-400 was immediately available, which\nwas attractive. I found a single slide from a Feb. 29 Pfizer presentation to\ninvestors, via a Google search that brought me to a biotech investor\u2019s tweet:\n\nWhile this was going on, we kept trying to get MDA\u2019s phase 1 clinical trials\ndepartment to recommend some trials to us, but they wouldn\u2019t. Bess faxed all\nmy information to MDA (healthcare systems use the world\u2019s fax machines and\npagers, stuck as they are in the past), with pleas for a return e-mail or\nphone call, but none came. She also tried leaving messages with the\ndepartment, and cold e-mailing PIs. No luck. We\u2019ve learned that if someone\nwon\u2019t, or can\u2019t, spend the cash and energy to show up in person, MDA isn\u2019t the\nright place. This is surprising to me, given how hard flying is for many\ncancer patients, how expensive cancer is, and given the fact that we\u2019re not\nliving in 1995 and have digital records, but at some point the organization\nbehaves how it behaves and the culture is what it is. We did get some\nunexpected help from someone at MDA (thank you! you know who you are), who\ntried to facilitate conversations between us and the right departments, but\neven that person couldn\u2019t break through the bureaucracy. By the time we\nfinally heard back from the oncologist at MDA, START was already moving me\nalong the qualification process for PDL1V. Plus, the MDA oncologist said I\nwasn\u2019t eligible for PDL1V. Bess and I were baffled, and might have asked why\nshe thought I wasn\u2019t eligible, but she\u2019d turned off the \u201creply\u201d feature in\nMDA\u2019s EHR; it didn\u2019t seem worth starting a new message thread. I was already\ntracked to start at START.\n\nWe decided to focus on PDL1V, the main reason being that, if I got another\ntrial, I\u2019d lose it forever due to the lines-of-therapy limitation; BGB-3055\nand ABBV-400 don\u2019t have lines-of-therapy limitations. Secondarily, that Pfizer\nslide shows three-quarters of patients responding to it, which is good by\nHNSCC standards. Somewhere in this ordeal, we also asked START if I could do a\nround of chemo and still qualify for PDL1V. START-San Antonio initially\nthought the answer was yes: getting a round of the exact same chemo I\u2019d had in\nsummer 2023 should be fine. We made appointments.\n\nSTART-Utah thought the same based on what was written in their provider\nguidelines (we\u2019ve learned to double check whenever possible). But Pfizer had\nscheduled a meeting later in the week to discuss updated guidelines, which\nmean the guidelines might be different in four days, and the answer obsolete.\nBess asked if they could confirm with Seagen\u2019s \u201cmedical liaison,\u201d who makes\nthe final eligibility decisions. The tumors in my neck were visibly growing,\nso I was worried about whether I\u2019d make it to mid-April, and even a delay of a\nfew days could affect my \u201cwashout period\u201d and the timing when I could start\nthe trial. But I delayed while waiting for their answer. Pfizer\u2019s decision:\nAny more chemo will count as a new line of therapy. If we hadn\u2019t known to ask\nabout the meeting, to ask for the medical liaison, to clarify and clarify\nagain, I\u2019d have lost a potential spot. We shelved the plan to get chemo.\n\nIn slightly good news, we were told that, if a patient fails the previous line\nof therapy, there is only a two-week washout period. So I could at least get\none more round of petosemtamab, on the off chance that I wasn\u2019t entirely\nresistant, which Dr. Sacco agreed to arrange. I flew back to San Diego on Mar.\n28 for an infusion on Mar. 29. Did that infusion do anything? Probably not,\nbut maybe, and it was something. Bess and I were watching the tumors in my\nneck grow larger seemingly by the day. At least the petosemtamab had kept the\ntumors in my lungs more or less in check.\n\nDr. Sacco also said that many trials will let patients get some spot radiation\nin an attempt to shrink tumors enough for the patient (me) to survive. We\ncontacted Dr. Patel at Mayo Phoenix about this, and he was like: \u201cMakes sense!\nLet\u2019s do it.\u201d We told him about the back-and-forth regarding whether I\u2019d\nactually be eligible, and he\u2019s clearly seen this game played before, because\nattitude was: \u201cLet\u2019s schedule a simulation so that you can get your mask made\nand be ready.\u201d Beautiful. And easy! I got the radiation simulation Apr. 4\n\nSTART told us that Pfizer was holding a kickoff meeting the first week of\nApril. That meeting happened, and we planned to target START-Utah, since Utah\nis closer to Arizona than San Antonio. There was some kind of unspecific\ninstitutional review board (IRB) holdup as well. Ultimately, START said that I\ncould get consented on Apr. 8, so I got a last-minute (meaning: $$$) ticket to\nUtah for Apr. 7. Unfortunately, START doesn\u2019t have its own CT machine on site,\nso getting the mandatory CT scans became yet another logistical challenge; I\nwill spare the details, apart from saying that something as simple as getting\nCT scans locally couldn\u2019t go smoothly, resulting in a seven-hour day to get 60\nseconds\u2019 worth of scans, an experience that might seem minor in the grand\nscheme of suffering, but which showcases the accumulation of seemingly minor\nproblems that together become crushing. It was exhausting. I was exhausted. I\nam exhausted. You are probably exhausted just reading this.\n\nI was so exhausted that I considered whether I wanted to terminate treatment,\nor just do local phase 1a trials, which is nearly equivalent to terminating\ntreatment, because 1a dose-finding trials start with such low concentrations\nof active medicine that, even if the medication ultimately works, the initial\npeople who get it probably won\u2019t see a response. I was sick. I was tired. I\nwas sick and tired of fighting bureaucracy. Bess and I spent a month\ncontinuously wrangling an inefficient, balky medical system. The void felt\nbetter than continuing the fight\u2014not the fight against cancer, but the fight\nagainst the balkanized clinical-trial system.\n\nUltimately, I went through with the PDL1V trial, flying to Utah on Apr. 14 and\nreceiving the first dose on Apr. 15. The worst parts of the process were\nbehind me. It\u2019s saying something when the \u201cworst part\u201d isn\u2019t the actual\ninfusion of a largely untested study drug. It isn\u2019t even the fatigue that\nfollowed. But I want to spend as much time with Bess as I can, before the\ncurtain falls, as it will likely will soon enough. I worry that I\u2019ll get hit\nwith a pulmonary embolism (PE), stroke, cardiac event, sudden breach of\ncritical blood vessels by tumors\u2014and I\u2019ll feel a sudden pain in my head or\nneck, then nothing. PDL1V could delay that moment.\n\nIn \u201cThe Council of Elrond\u201d from The Fellowship of the Ring, Gandalf gives an\naccount of his captivity by the traitorous Saruman, and he says: \u201cMay Elrond\nand the others forgive the length of it.\u201d May you forgive the length of this\naccount.^[7] It gives a flavor of my life, but it may also prove educational\nto patients who are suffering as I have\u2014firstly from cancer and other dread\ndiseases, but secondly from the process of searching for treatment.\n\n[1] \u201cLigne Maginot\u201d in French, according to Wikipedia.\n\n[2] In my case, cancer also chose to take the Belgian route, bypassing our\ndefenses and leading to my personal Dunkirk, except even more disastrous.\n\n[3] ADCs are hot in oncology because results so far show them as being\nefficacious and with fewer side effects than things like chemotherapy. One\ndescription says ADCs \u201ccouple two therapies, basically work like guided\nmissiles. A toxic warhead is strapped to a missile that homes in on and drops\nits payload on a specific tumor.\u201d PDL1V contains a chemo agent called MMAE,\nwhich Wikipedia says shows \u201cpotency of up to 200 times that of vinblastine.\u201d\nSeagen is a, or the, leader in ADCs, and Pfizer just bought it for $43\nbillion, which is a vote for ADCs\u2019 potential.\n\n[4] We were also interested in a small-molecule called NT219, but that drug\nhad completed its phase 1b trial and hasn\u2019t yet moved to phase 2 or\napproval\u2014so another promising candidate from our previous research was lost to\nus.\n\n[5] Dr. Sacco also recommended an ADC trial, if possible, because of the\namount of research (and money) are indications that that mechanism of action\nis likely to work.\n\n[6] One reader suggests: \u201cThe Hippocratic oath may be incompatible with\ncapitalism if shareholders continue to be prioritized over the researchers who\ndesperately need this data in order to make informed decisions for patients\nlike me.\u201d My view is different: the FDA rules that drive and create this\ninsane process are imposed by government. The drug companies want to sell\ndrugs! I want to take drugs. For fatal diseases like R / M HNSCC, there should\nbe basic safety studies\u2014essentially phase 1a and 1b studies\u2014and from there\noncologists should be allowed to prescribe novel therapies.\n\n[7] Gandalf\u2019s captivity is not just physical but also involves psychological\ndimensions as he deals with isolation, uncertainty, and deception. Cancer\npatients face emotional and mental torment, dealing not only with their\nphysical illness but also with the psychological burden of managing their\ntreatment process, which is often opaque\u2014and, in my case, unending, or rather\nending only in death. Most of the clinical trials see a tiny number of\npatients get \u201ccomplete response,\u201d or the apparent elimination of their\ncancers, but that is so rare that I\u2019m discounting it for myself.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Share\n\n  * Email\n  * Facebook\n  * Reddit\n  * Twitter\n  * Print\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\n\u201cPlease be dying, but not too quickly: a clinical trial story\u201dOctober 22,\n2023In \"Culture\"\n\nTentative, fluttering optimism: The R & D ferment in head and neck cancer\ntreatmentDecember 7, 2023In \"Essays\"\n\n\u201cDays of Awe: The clinical trial drug that might save my husband\u2019s\nlife\u201dOctober 2, 2023In \"Essays\"\n\n### One response\n\n  1.

Is\nthere any market mechanism that \u201cpunishes\u201d an institution like MDA for being\nso rigid?\n\nLikeLike\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\nJoin 3,653 other subscribers\n\n# Contact me:\n\nIn Anything You Want, Derek Sivers says: \"The coolest people I meet are the\nones who find me through something I've written.\" Reach me at\nseligerj@gmail.com.\n\n# Recent Posts\n\n  * The emotional trial of clinical trials, part 1: It\u2019s like online dating except if you choose wrong you die\n  * Moderna mRNA-4157 (V90) news for head and neck cancer patients like me\n  * Links: Levelling up, the vitality of normalcy, hot ebikes, and more!\n  * Links: The CCP controls a major media source, 3D printing, healthcare innovation, and more!\n  * In which the squamous cell carcinoma tumors in my neck grow by 20% in two months\n\nApril 2024M| T| W| T| F| S| S  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7  \n8| 9| 10| 11| 12| 13| 14  \n15| 16| 17| 18| 19| 20| 21  \n22| 23| 24| 25| 26| 27| 28  \n29| 30  \n  \n# Archives\n\n### The Story's Story\n\nBlog at WordPress.com.\n\n\u2191\n\n  * Comment\n  * Reblog\n  * Subscribe Subscribed\n\n    * The Story's Story\n    * Already have a WordPress.com account?
