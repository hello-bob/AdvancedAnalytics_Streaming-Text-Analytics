Razer marketed the device as\noffering capabilities similar to those of an N95 respirator.\n\nOn October 21, 2021, Razer began selling the Zephyr and its replacement\nfilters. Razer continued to sell the mask until January 2022 and kept pushing\nthe filters until July 2022, according to the FTC's complaint [PDF].\n\nPer the FTC, when Razer.com listed the Zephyr in 2021, it said that the mask\noffered \"replaceable N95 Grade filters\" and that Zephyr was \"FDA-registered\nand lab-tested for 99 percent BFE [bacterial filtration efficiency]\" and\noffered \"greater protection compared to standard disposable/cloth masks, and\nfilters air both inhaled and exhaled to safeguard you and others around you.\"\nRazer's site also reportedly said that the mask was \"not tested specifically\nagainst the COVID-19 virus, but offers the same functionality and adequate\nprotection due to its 99 percent BFE rating.\u201d\n\nThe FTC's complaint, filed in the US District Court for the Central District\nof California, contains examples\u2014from online statements from Razer's CEO to\nposts on Razer's social media accounts and website\u2014describing the Zephyr as\noffering N95 or N95 grade capabilities since at least January 2021.\n\nHowever, the FTC said that Razer never got the Zephyr tested by the National\nInstitute for Occupational Safety and Health or the US Food and Drug\nAdministration and that the Zephyr never received N95 certification.\n\n\u201c[Razer] falsely claimed, in the midst of a global pandemic, that their face\nmask was the equivalent of an N95 certified respirator,\u201d Samuel Levine,\ndirector of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## FTC says Razer knew Zephyr wasn\u2019t N95 equivalent\n\nThe \"99 percent BFE rating\" that Razer touted only referred to the mask's\nfilters, however, and per the FTC's complaint: \"Razer had no evidence that the\nmask as a whole would offer adequate protection against the COVID-19 virus\nbased solely on the BFE characteristic of the filter material.\"\n\nIt continues:\n\n> In fact, Razer knew from testing the PFE [Particulate Filtration Efficiency]\n> performance of the Zephyr that the mask as a whole performed worse with\n> respect to filtering out foreign material than the filter material did on\n> its own.\n\nIn the months before the Zephyr's release, a third party, Intertek, tested the\nmask. The best results for the device showed it reaching a maximum PFE level\n\"of 83.2 percent with the fans off and 86.3 percent with the fans on\" and that\nthe mask \"frequently tested much lower,\" per FTC's complaint. The figures are\nnotably lower than the minimum PFE level of 95 percent required for an N95\nrespirator.\n\n## Razer kept pushing Zephyr despite warnings\n\nThe FTC's complaint against Razer, which is best known for high-priced, RGB-\nriddled PC gaming peripherals, claimed that Razer continued promoting the\nZephyr despite consultants highlighting the mask's lack of certification and\nprotection.\n\n\u201cTheir use of deceptive advertising and misinformation posed a risk to public\nhealth and safety,\" the FTC's complaint said.\n\nAccording to the FTC, in March 2021, Intertek warned Razer via email against\nsaying that the Zephyr uses an N95 grade filter because N95 \"is not relevant\nto this product, and the claim will cause confusion.\"\n\nStill, on August 20, 2021, Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan said via Facebook: \"One of\nour beta tests of the Razer Zephyr pinged me and said, 'Isn't this just an\nN95, but a lot more comfortable and reusable?' Well, that's really the point.\nFor us to achieve N95 grade 99 percent BFE filters and ensure it's reusable,\nall other features are secondary.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FTC also accused Razer's senior director of regulator and compliance of\ndeciding in September 2021 to remove disclaimer text on the Zephyr's packaging\nthat employee testers proposed, namely that the mask \"is not a medical device,\nrespirator [or] surgical mask\" and that the \"product is not FDA-approved.\"\nRazer's ultimate disclaimer noted that the mask is not personal protective\nequipment and is only intended for use with Zephyr Filters, though.\n\nIn November 2021, the Justice and Consumer Protection Agency of Hamburg,\nGermany sent Razer a letter telling the firm that it opened an inquiry about\nthe Zephyr's health claims, the FTC said. Razer stopped selling the mask in\nthe European Union on December 13, 2021, after receiving a follow-up letter,\nbut continued selling the device in the US.\n\n## Fewer than 6 percent of US customers refunded ... so far\n\nOn January 13, 2022, after pressure from reviewers and Razer's global PR\ndirector, Razer publicly backtracked on its claims. In an email to customers,\nRazer said that while the Zephyr's filters were \"tested for 95 percent\nParticulate Filtration Efficiency (PFE) and 99 percent Bacterial Filtration\nEfficiency (BFE) ... the wearable by itself is not a medical device nor\ncertified as an N95 mask.\" Razer also said it would remove all references to\n\"N95 Grade Filter\" from marketing materials. However, the FTC said that only\ncustomers who bought the mask from Razer's website or provided their emails to\nphysical Razer stores when buying a mask received the email.\n\nFurther, Razer's email reportedly failed to mention that the company offered\nfull refunds. Due to Razer declining refunds for users outside the 14-day\npurchase window or who had used or opened the mask and/or filters, Razer\nreportedly refunded fewer than 6 percent of Zephyr purchases in the US.\n\nHowever, the proposed settlement against Razer includes a $100,000 civil\npenalty, plus $1,071,254.33, which the FTC said is equal to the amount of\nrevenue Razer made from the Zephyr and will go toward refunding \"defrauded\nconsumers.\"\n\nRazer didn't respond to Ars' request for comment before this story's\npublication.
