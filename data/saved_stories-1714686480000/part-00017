Think of the company, Acorns\u2014they round up\nusers\u2019 transactions to the nearest dollar and invest that money each time\nusers transact with their debit cards. Could something similar be done with\nblockchain usage?\n\n### Enter Account Abstraction\n\nThe answer is yes. With the programmability that account abstraction provides,\nmoney can be be saved or invested each time users transact on the blockchain.\n\n### Okay, But How Much Money Would Be Saved?\n\nIn the case of Acorns, most users transact with their debit cards multiple\ntimes a day. Suppose the average amount saved per transaction is 50 cents. At\na hypothetical average of 3 transactions per day, that\u2019s $45 saved per\nmonth\u2014not bad. Now, what about blockchains; how frequently do people use them?\nThat\u2019s precisely the question we wanted to answer, thereby prompting this\ninvestigation.\n\n## Methodology\n\n### A Representative Sample\n\nWe wanted to identify a concentrated group of addresses that are reasonably\nrepresentative of folks that use blockchains regularly. With this in mind, we\nchose ETHGlobal hackathon winners, as they represent a technical group of\ncrypto builders who are likely to use blockchains regularly. ETHGlobal is an\norganization that hosts EVM-based hackathons globally, multiple times a year.\nAll team members at Locker have won multiple hackathons, for which bounties\nwere received. We therefore decided to look at the on-chain transactions that\ndistributed those bounty payments. There, we found the recipient addresses of\nother hackathon winners. Great\u2014but one hackathon wasn\u2019t enough, so we extended\nour sample to include winners of 7 hackathons, spanning multiple regions of\nthe world over the last 2 years.\n\n### Gathering and Cleaning Data\n\nWith hackathon winners identified, we queried the most recent 1,000 blockchain\ntransactions for each address on the Ethereum blockchain. We then filtered the\ndata, removing addresses with no blockchain usage and addresses with outlier\nusage, clearly representative of trading bots. We then repeated this process\nfor 7 other well-known blockchains.\n\n## Results\n\nThe results for 8 different blockchains are shown below.\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Distributions of Average Transactions Per Month Across 8 Chains\n\nThe above captures distributions of how frequently ETHGlobal hackathon winners\nsubmit transactions to 8 different blockchains.\n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Statistics On Average Usage Per Month Per User Per Chain\n\nThe above captures statistics on how frequently ETHGlobal hackathon winners\nsubmit transactions to 8 different blockchains.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nHackathon winners don\u2019t use the blockchain very frequently. Given this\ninformation, we\u2019ve decided to explore a different go-to-market approach with\nLocker, focusing on users that frequently get paid in crypto.\n\n## Areas For Improvement\n\n  * Hackathon winners may not necessarily be representative of the whole space. Therefore, the study can be improved by increasing the quantity and quality of the sample set.\n\n  * While the current sample set did exclude all accounts with no usage, participants might primarily use different addresses on other chains than the one receiving bounty payments on Ethereum, potentially skewing the results. Obtaining a sample set of primary addresses for each chain would improve the analysis.\n\n  * It would be useful to gain insight into how much value is transferred in the gathered transactions across different chains\u2014do those amounts change with transaction frequency? For example, it\u2019s possible that less frequent users transfer more value on average, compared to those that use blockchains frequently.\n\n  * It would be useful to gain insight into what types of transactions are submitted. For example, swaps, peer-to-peer payments, or yield-bearing pool deposits.\n\n## References\n\nHere\u2019s the code used for the analysis above.\n\n## Subscribe\n\nIf you enjoyed this research, please subscribe!
