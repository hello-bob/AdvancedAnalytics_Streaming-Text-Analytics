For the recognition\nand correction of such malfunctions intelligent human intervention will in\ngeneral be necessary.\u201d \u2014 John von Neumann, First Draft of a Report on the\nEDVAC, 1945\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t blog, tweet! If you can\u2019t tweet, like!\u201d \u2014 Kim Dotcom, Mr.\nPresident, 2012\n\n## Invisible and Very Busy\n\nComputers are getting invisible. They shrink and hide. They lurk under the\nskin and dissolve in the cloud. We observe the process like an eclipse of the\nsun, partly scared, partly overwhelmed. We divide into camps and fight about\nadvantages and dangers of The Ubiquitous. But whatever side we take \u2014 we do\nacknowledge the significance of the moment.\n\nWith the disappearance of the computer, something else is silently becoming\ninvisible as well \u2014 the User. Users are disappearing as both phenomena and\nterm, and this development is either unnoticed or accepted as progress \u2014 an\nevolutionary step.\n\nThe notion of the Invisible User is pushed by influential user interface\ndesigners, specifically by Don Norman a guru of user friendly design and long\ntime advocate of invisible computing. He can be actually called the father of\nInvisible Computing.\n\nThose who study interaction design read his \u201cWhy Interfaces Don\u2019t Work\u201d\npublished in 1990 in which he asked and answered his own question: \u201cThe real\nproblem with the interface is that it is an interface\u201d. What\u2019s to be done? \u201cWe\nneed to aid the task, not the interface to the task. The computer of the\nfuture should be invisible!\u201d1\n\nIt took almost two decades, but the future arrived around five years ago, when\nclicking mouse buttons ceased to be our main input method and touch and multi-\ntouch technologies hinted at our new emancipation from hardware. The cosiness\nof iProducts, as well as breakthroughs in Augmented Reality (it got mobile),\nrise of wearables, maturing of all sorts of tracking (motion, face) and the\nadvancement of projection technologies erased the visible border between input\nand output devices. These developments began to turn our interactions with\ncomputers into pre-computer actions or, as interface designers prefer to say,\n\u201cnatural\u201d gestures and movements.\n\nOf course computers are still distinguishable and locatable, but they are no\nlonger something you sit in front of. The forecasts for invisibility are so\noptimistic that in 2012 Apple allowed to themselves to rephrase Norman\u2019s\npredictive statement by putting it in the present tense and binding it to a\nparticular piece of consumer electronics:\n\n> We believe that technology is at its very best when it is invisible, when\n> you are conscious only of what you are doing, not the device you are doing\n> it with [...] iPad is the perfect expression of that idea, it\u2019s just this\n> magical pane of glass that can become anything you want it to be. It\u2019s a\n> more personal experience with technology than people have ever had.2\n\nIn this last sentence, the word \u201cexperience\u201d is not an accident, neither is\nthe word \u201cpeople\u201d.\n\nInvisible computers, or more accurately the illusion of the computerless, is\ndestroyed if we continue to talk about \u201cuser interfaces\u201d. This is why\nInterface Design starts to rename itself to Experience Design \u2014 whose primary\ngoal is to make users forget that computers and interfaces exist. With\nExperience Design there is only you and your emotions to feel, goals to\nachieve, tasks to complete.\n\nThe field is abbreviated as UXD, where X is for eXperience and U is still for\nthe Users. Wikipedia says Don Norman coined the term UX in 1995. However, in\n2012 UX designers avoid to use the U-word in papers and conference\nannouncements, in order not to remind themselves about all those clumsy\nbuttons and input devices of the past. Users were for the interfaces.\nExperiences, they are for the PEOPLE!3\n\nIn 2008 Don Norman simply ceased to address Users as Users. At an event\nsponsored by Adaptive Path, a user interface design company, Norman stated\n\u201cOne of the horrible words we use is users. I am on a crusade to get rid of\nthe word \u2018users\u2019. I would prefer to call them \u2018people.\u2019\u201d4 After enjoying the\neffect of his words on the audience he added with a charming smile, \u201cWe design\nfor people, we don\u2019t design for users.\u201d\n\nA noble goal in deed, but only when perceived in the narrow context of\nInterface Design. Here, the use of the term \u201cpeople\u201d emphasizes the need to\nfollow the user centered in opposition to an implementation centered paradigm.\nThe use of \u201cpeople\u201d in this context is a good way to remind software\ndevelopers that the User is a human being and needs to be taken into account\nin design and validation processes.\n\nBut when you read it in a broader context, the denial of the word \u201cuser\u201d in\nfavor of \u201cpeople\u201d becomes dangerous. Being a User is the last reminder that\nthere is, whether visible or not, a computer, a programmed system you use.\n\nIn 2011 new media theoretician Lev Manovich also became unhappy about the word\n\u201cuser\u201d. He writes on his blog \u201cFor example, how do we call a person who is\ninteracting with digital media? User? No good.\u201d5\n\nWell, I can agree that with all the great things we can do with new media \u2014\nvarious modes of initiation and participation, multiple roles we can fill \u2014\nthat it is a pity to narrow it down to \u201cusers\u201d, but this is what it is.\nBloggers, artists, podcasters and even trolls are still users of systems they\ndidn\u2019t program. So they (we) are all the users.\n\nWe need to take care of this word because addressing people and not users\nhides the existence of two classes of people \u2014 developers and users. And if we\nlose this distinction, users may lose their rights and the opportunity to\nprotect them. These rights are to demand better software, the ability \u201cto\nchoose none of the above\u201d6, to delete your files, to get your files back, to\nfail epically and, back to the fundamental one, to see the computer.\n\nIn other words: the Invisible User is more of an issue than an Invisible\nComputer.\n\nWhat can be done to protect the term, the notion and the existence of the\nUsers? What counter arguments can I find to stop Norman\u2019s crusade and dispel\nManovich\u2019s skepticism? What do we know about a user, apart from the opinion\nthat it is \u201cno good\u201d to be one?\n\nWe know that it was not always like this. Before Real Users (those who pay\nmoney to use the system) became \u201cusers\u201d, programmers and hackers proudly used\nthis word to describe themselves. In their view, the user was the best role\none could take in relation to their computer.7\n\nFurthermore, it is wrong to think that first there were computers and\ndevelopers and only later users entered the scene. In fact, it was the\nopposite. At the dawn of personal computer the user was the center of\nattention. The user did not develop in parallel with the computer, but prior\nto it. Think about Vanevar Bush\u2019s \u201cAs we May Think\u201d (1945), one of the most\ninfluential texts in computer culture. Bush spends more words describing the\nperson who would use the Memex than the Memex itself. He described a\nscientists of the future, a superman. He, the user of the Memex, not the\nMemex, itself was heading the article.8\n\n20 years later, Douglas Engelbart, inventor of the pioneering personal\ncomputer system NLS, as well as hypertext, and the mouse, talked about his\nresearch on the augmentation of human intellect as \u201cbootstraping\u201d \u2014 meaning\nthat human beings, and their brains and bodies, will evolve along with new\ntechnology. This is how French sociologist Thierry Bardini describes this\napproach in his book about Douglas Engelbart: \u201cEngelbart wasn\u2019t interested in\njust building the personal computer. He was interested in building the person\nwho could use the computer to manage increasing complexity efficiently.\u201d9\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the title of J.C.R. Licklider\u2019s famous text, the one that\noutlined the principles for APRAs Command and Control research on Real Time\nSystem, from which the interactive/personal computer developed \u2014 Man-Computer\nSymbiosis (1960).10\n\nWhen the personal computer was getting ready to enter the market 15 years\nlater, developers thought about who would be model users. At XEROX PARC, Alan\nKay and Adele Goldberg introduced the idea of kids, artists, musicians and\nothers as potential users for the new technology. Their paper \u201cPersonal\nDynamic Media\u201d from 197711 describes important hardware and software\nprinciples for the personal computer. But we read this text as revolutionary\nbecause it clearly establishes possible users, distinct from system\ndevelopers, as essential to these dynamic technologies. Another Xerox\nemployee, Tim Mott (aka \u201cThe father of user centered design\u201d) brought the idea\nof a Secretary into the imagination of his colleagues. This image of the \u201cLady\nwith the Royal Typewriter\u201d12 predetermined the designs of XEROX Star, Apple\nLisa and and further electronic offices.\n\nSo, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that users existed prior to computers, that\nthey were imagined and invented \u2014 Users are the figment of the imagination. As\na result of their fictive construction, they continued to be re-imagined and\nre-invented through the 70\u2019s, 80\u2019s, 90\u2019s, and the new millennium. But however\nreasonable, or brave, or futuristic, or primitive these models of users were,\nthere is a constant.\n\nLet me refer to another guru of user centered design, Alan Cooper. In 2007,\nwhen the U word was still allowed in interaction design circles, he and his\ncolleagues shared their secret in \u201cAbout Face, The Essentials of Interaction\nDesign\u201d:\n\n> \u201cAs an interaction designer, it\u2019s best to imagine that users \u2013 especially \u2014\n> beginners \u2014 are simultaneously very intelligent and very busy.\u201d13\n\nIt is very kind advice (and one of the most reasonable books on interface\ndesign, btw) and can be translated roughly as \u201chey, front end developers,\ndon\u2019t assume that your users are more stupid than you, they are just busy.\u201d\nBut it is more than this. What the second part of this quote gets to so\nimportantly is that Users are people who are very busy with something else.\n\nAlan Cooper is not the one who invented this paradigm, and not even Don Norman\nwith his concentration on task rather than the tool. It originated in the\n1970\u2019s. Listing the most important computer terms of that time, Ted Nelson\nmentions so called \u201cuser level systems\u201d and states that these \u201cUser-level\nsystems, [are] systems set up for people who are not thinking about computers\nbut about the subject or activity the computer is supposed to help them\nwith.\u201d14 Some pages before he claims:\n\n15\n\nOne should remember that Ted Nelson was always on the side of users and even\n\u201cna\u00efve users\u201d so his bitter \u201cjust a user\u201d means a lot.\n\nAlienation of users from their computers started in XEROX PARC with\nsecretaries, as well as artists and musicians. And it never stopped. Users\nwere seen and marketed as people who\u2019s real jobs, feelings, thoughts,\ninterests, talents \u2014 everything what matters \u2014 lie outside of their\ninteraction with personal computers.\n\nFor instance, in 2007, when Adobe, the software company who\u2019s products are\ndominating the so called \u201ccreative industries\u201d, introduced version 3 of\nCreative Suite, they filmed graphic artists, video makers and others talking\nabout the advantages of this new software package. In particular interesting\nwas one video of a web designer (or an actress in the role of a web designer):\nshe enthusiastically demonstrated what her new Dream Weaver could do, and that\nin the end \u201cI have more time to do what I like most \u2014 being creative\u201d. The\nmessage from Adobe is clear. The less you think about source code, scripts,\nlinks and the web itself, the more creative you are as a web designer. What a\nlie. I liked to show it to fresh design students as an example of\nmisunderstanding the core of the profession.\n\nThis video is not online anymore, but actual ads for Creative Suite 6 are not\nmuch different \u2013 they feature designers and design evangelists talking about\nunleashing, increasing and enriching creativity as a direct result of fewer\nclicks to achieve this or that effect.16\n\nIn the book \u201cProgram or be Programmed\u201d, Douglas Rushkoff describes similar\nphenomena:\n\n> [...] We see actual coding as some boring chore, a working class skill like\n> bricklaying, which may as well be outsourced to some poor nation while our\n> kids play and even design video games. We look at developing the plots and\n> characters for a game as the interesting part, and the programming as the\n> rote task better offloaded to people somewhere else.17\n\nRushkoff states that code writing is not seen as a creative activity, but the\nsame applies to engagement with the computer in general. It is not seen as a\ncreative task or as \u201cmature thought\u201d.\n\nIn \u201cAs we may think\u201d, while describing an ideal instrument that would augment\nthe scientist of the future, Vanevar Bush mentions\n\n> For mature thought there is no mechanical substitute. But creative thought\n> and essentially repetitive thought are very different things. For the latter\n> there are, and may be, powerful mechanical aids18\n\nOpposed to this, users, as imagined by computer scientists, software\ndevelopers and usability experts are the ones who\u2019s task is to spend as little\ntime as possible with the computer, without wasting a single thought on it.\nThey require a specialized, isolated app for every \u201crepetitive thought\u201d, and,\nmost importantly, delegate drawing the border in between creative and\nrepetitive, mature and primitive, real and virtual, to app designers.\n\nThere are periods in history, moments in life (and many hours a day!) where\nthis approach makes sense, when delegation and automation are required and\nenjoyed. But in times when every aspect of life is computerized it is not\npossible to accept \u201cbusy with something else\u201d as a norm.\n\nSo let\u2019s look at another model of users that evolved outside and despite\nusability experts\u2019 imagination.\n\n\u201cA scientist of the Future\u201d Title picture of Vanevar Bush\u2019s \u201cAs we make think\u201d\nIllustrated version from Life magazine, 1945\n\nRussian travel blogger Sergey Dolya photo by Mik Sazonov, 2012\n\n## General Purpose, \u201cStupid\u201d and Universal\n\nIn \u201cWhy Interfaces Don\u2019t Work\u201d Don Norman heavily criticizes the world of\nvisible computers, visible interfaces and users busy with all this. Near the\nend of the text he suggests the source of the problem:\n\n> \u201cWe are here in part, because this is probably the best we can do with\n> today\u2019s technology and, in part, because of historical accident. The\n> accident is that we have adapted a general-purpose technology to very\n> specialized tasks while still using general tools.\u201d19\n\nIn December 2011 science fiction writer and journalist Cory Doctorow gave a\nmarvelous talk at the 28th Chaos Communication Congress in Berlin titled \u201cThe\ncoming war on general computation\u201d.20 He explains that there is only one\npossibility for computers to truly become appliances, the tiny, invisible,\ncomfortable one purpose things Don Norman was preaching about: to be loaded\nwith spyware. He explains,\n\n> \u201cSo today we have marketing departments who say things like \u2018[...] Make me a\n> computer that doesn\u2019t run every program, just a program that does this\n> specialized task, like streaming audio, or routing packets, or playing Xbox\n> games\u2019 [...] But that\u2019s not what we do when we turn a computer into an\n> appliance. We\u2019re not making a computer that runs only the \u201cappliance\u201d app;\n> we\u2019re making a computer that can run every program, but which uses some\n> combination of rootkits, spyware, and code-signing to prevent the user from\n> knowing which processes are running, from installing her own software, and\n> from terminating processes that she doesn\u2019t want. In other words, an\n> appliance is not a stripped-down computer \u2014 it is a fully functional\n> computer with spyware on it out of the box.\u201d\n\nBy fully functional computer Doctorow means the general purpose computer, or\nas US mathematician John von Neumann referred to it in his 1945 \u201cFirst Draft\nof a Report on the EDVAC\u201d \u2014 the \u201call purpose automatic digital computing\nsystem\u201d.21 In this paper he outlined the principles of digital computer\narchitecture (von Neumann Architecture), where hardware was separated from the\nsoftware and from this the so called \u201cstored program\u201d concept was born. In the\nmid 40\u2019s the revolutionary impact of it was that \u201cby storing the instructions\nelectronically, you could change the function of the computer without having\nto change the wiring.\u201d22\n\nToday the rewiring aspect doesn\u2019t have to be emphasized, but the idea itself\nthat a single computer can do everything is essential, and that it is the same\ngeneral purpose computer behind \u201ceverything\u201d from dumb terminals to super\ncomputers.\n\nDoctorow\u2019s talk is a perfect entry point to get oneself acquainted with the\nsubject. To go deeper into the history of the war on general computation you\nmay consider reading Ted Nelson. He was the first to attract attention to the\nsignificance of the personal computer\u2019s all-purpose nature. In 1974 in his\nglorious fanzine \u201cComputer Lib\u201d which aimed to explain computers to everybody,\nhe writes in caps lock:\n\n> COMPUTERS HAVE NO NATURE AND NO CHARACTER Computers are, unlike any other\n> piece of equipment, perfectly BLANK. And that is how we have projected on it\n> so many different faces.23\n\nSome great texts written this century are \u201cThe Future of the Internet and How\nto Stop It\u201d (2008) by Jonathan Zittrain and of course \u201cThe Future of Ideas\u201d\n(2001) by Lawrence Lessig. Both authors are more concerned with the\narchitecture of the internet than the computer itself but both write about the\nend-to-end principle that lies at the internet\u2019s core \u2014 meaning that there is\nno intelligence (control) build into the network. The network stays neutral or\n\u201cstupid\u201d, simply delivering packets without asking what\u2019s inside. It is the\nsame with the von Neuman computer \u2014 it just runs programs.\n\nThe works of Lessig, Zittrain and Doctorow do a great job of explaining why\nboth computer and network architectures are neither historic accidents nor\n\u201cwhat technology wants\u201d.24 The stupid network and the general purpose computer\nwere conscious design decisions.\n\nFor Norman, further generations of hardware and software designers and their\ninvisible users dealing with General Purpose technology is both accident and\nobstacle. For the rest of us the rise and use of General Purpose Technology is\nthe core of New media, Digital Culture and Information Society (if you believe\nthat something like this exists). General purpose computers and Stupid\nNetworks are the core values of our computer-based time and the driving force\nbehind all the wonderful and terrible things that happen to people who work\nand live with connected computers. These prescient design decisions have to be\nprotected today, because technically it would be no big deal to make networks\nand computers \u201csmart\u201d, i.e. controlled.\n\nWhat does it all have to do with \u201cusers\u201d versus \u201cpeople\u201d \u2014 apart from the self\nevident fact that only the users who are busy with computers at least a little\nbit \u2014 to the extent of watching Doctorow\u2019s video till the end \u2014 will fight for\nthese values?\n\nI would like to apply the concept of General Purpose Technology to users by\nflipping the discourse around and redirecting attention from technology to the\nuser that was formed through three decades of adjusting general purpose\ntechnology to their needs: The General Purpose User.\n\nGeneral Purpose Users can write an article in their e-mail client, layout\ntheir business card in Excel and shave in front of a web cam. They can also\nfind a way to publish photos online without flickr, tweet without twitter,\nlike without facebook, make a black frame around pictures without instagram,\nremove a black frame from an instagram picture and even wake up at 7:00\nwithout a \u201cwake up at 7:00\u201d app.\n\nMaybe these Users could more accurately be called Universal Users or Turing\nComplete Users, as a reference to the Universal Machine, also known as\nUniversal Turing Machine \u2014 Alan Turing\u2019s conception of a computer that can\nsolve any logical task given enough time and memory. Turing\u2019s 1936 vision and\ndesign predated and most likely influenced von Neuman\u2019s First Draft and All-\npurpose Machine.\n\nBut whatever name I chose, what I mean are users who have the ability to\nachieve their goals regardless of the primary purpose of an application or\ndevice. Such users will find a way to their aspiration without an app or\nutility programmed specifically for it. The Universal user is not a super\nuser, not half a hacker. It is not an exotic type of user.\n\nThere can be different examples and levels of autonomy that users can imagine\nfor themselves, but the capacity to be universal is still in all of us.\nSometimes it is a conscious choice not to delegate particular jobs to the\ncomputer, and sometimes it is just a habit. Most often it is not more than a\nclick or two that uncover your general purpose architecture.\n\nFor instance, you can decide not to use Twitter at all and instead inform the\nworld about your breakfast through your own website. You can use Live Journal\nas if it is Twitter, you can use Twitter as Twitter, but instead of following\npeople, visit their profiles as you\u2019d visit a homepage.\n\nYou can have two Twitter accounts and log in to one in Firefox, and the other\nin Chrome. This is how I do it and it doesn\u2019t matter why I prefer to manage it\nthis way. Maybe I don\u2019t know that an app for managing multiple accounts\nexists, maybe I knew but didn\u2019t like it, or maybe I\u2019m too lazy to install it.\nWhatever, I found a way. And you will do as well.\n\nA Universal User\u2019s mind set (it is a mind set, not set of rules, not a vow)\nmeans to liaise with hardware and software. Behavior that is antipodal to the\n\u201cvery busy\u201d user. This kind of interaction makes the user visible, most\nimportantly to themselves. And, if you wish to think about it in terms of\nInterface Design and UX, it is the ultimate experience.\n\nDoes this mean that to deliver this kind of user experience the software\nindustry needs to produce imperfect software or hold itself back from\nimproving existing tools? Of course not! Tools can be perfect.\n\nThough the idea of perfect software could be revised, taking into account that\nit is used by the General Purpose User, valuing ambiguity and users\u2019\ninvolvement.\n\nAnd thankfully ambiguity is not that rare. There are online services where\nusers are left alone to use or ignore features. For example, the developers of\nTwitter didn\u2019t take measures that prevent me from surfing from profile to\nprofile of people I don\u2019t follow. The Dutch social network Hyves allows their\nusers to mess around with background images so that they don\u2019t need any photo\nalbums or instagrams to be happy. Blingee.com, who\u2019s primary goal is to let\nusers add glitter to their photos, allows to upload whatever stamps they want\n\u2014 not glittery, not even animated. It just delivers the user merged layers in\nreturn.\n\nI can also mention here an extreme example of a service that nourishes the\nuser\u2019s universality \u2014 myknet.org \u2014 an Aboriginal social network in Canada. It\nis so \u201cstupid\u201d that users can re-purpose their profiles every time they update\nthem. Today it functions as a twitter feed, yesterday it was a youtube\nchannel, and tomorrow it might be an online shop. Never-mind that it looks\nvery low-tech and like it was made 17 years ago, it works!\n\nIn general the WWW, outside of Facebook, is an environment open for\ninterpretation.\n\nStill, I have difficulties finding a site or an app, that actually addresses\nthe users, and sees their presence as a part of the work flow. This maybe\nsounds strange, because all web 2.0 is about pushing people to contribute, and\n\u201cemotional design\u201d is supposed to be about establishing personal connections\nin between people who made the app and people who bought it, but I mean\nsomething different. I mean a situation when the work flow of an application\nhas gaps that can be filled by users, where smoothness and seamlessness are\nbroken and some of the final links in the chain are left for the users to\ncomplete.\n\nI\u2019ll leave you with an extreme example, an anonymous (probably student)\nproject: \u201cGoogle Maps + Google Video + Mashup \u2014 Claude Lelouch\u2019s Rendezvous\u201d:\n\nIt was made in 2006, at the very rise of Web 2.025, when the mash-up was a\nvery popular cultural, mainstream artistic form. Artists were celebrating new\nconvergences and a blurring of the borders between different pieces of\nsoftware. Lelouch\u2019s Rendezvous is a mash up that puts on the same page the\nfamous racing film of the same name and a map of Paris, so that you can follow\nthe car in the film and see its position on the Google map at the same time.\nBut the author failed (or perhaps didn\u2019t intend) to synchronize the video and\nthe car\u2019s movement on the map. As a result the user is left with the\ninstruction: \u201cHit play on the video. [...] At the 4 second mark, hit the \u2018Go!\u2019\nbutton.\u201d\n\nThe user is asked not only to press one but two buttons! It suggests that we\ntake care ourselves, that we make can complete a task at the right moment. The\nauthor obviously counts on users intelligence, and never heard that they are\n\u201cvery busy\u201d.\n\nThe fact that the original video file that was used in the mash up was\nremoved, makes this project even more interesting. To enjoy it, you\u2019ll have to\ngo to YouTube and look for another version of the film. I found one, which\nmeans you\u2019ll succeed as well.\n\nThere is nothing one user can do, that another can\u2019t given enough time and\nrespect. Computer Users are Turing Complete.\n\n* * *\n\nWhen Sherry Turkle, Douglas Rushkoff and other great minds state that we need\nto learn programming and understand our computers in order to not be\nprogrammed and \u201cdemand transparency of other systems\u201d26, I couldn\u2019t agree\nmore. If the approach to computer education in schools was to switch from\nmanaging particular apps to writing apps it will be wonderful. But apart from\nthe fact that it is not realistic, I would say it is also not enough. I would\nsay it is wrong to say either you understand computers or u are the user.27\n\nAn effort must be made to educate the users about themselves. There should be\nunderstanding of what it means to be a user of an \u201call purpose automatic\ndigital computing system\u201d.\n\nGeneral Purpose Users are not a historic accident or a temporary anomaly.
