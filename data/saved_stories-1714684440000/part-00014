In other words, that graphics card which is sitting there doing\npractically nothing all day in my gaming PC could be put to work, couldn\u2019t it?\n\nLately, we\u2019ve been on a bit of a mission to help folks looking to bring hosted\nservices in-house. Today\u2019s target is photos, using Immich \u2014 a self-hosted\nphoto and video management solution. Think Google Photos, only it runs on your\nhardware and the data it harvests remains yours.\n\nThe obvious downside to hosting these things yourself is that you can\u2019t\noutsource the facial recognition or smart search object detection to someone\nelse. Instead, it\u2019s up to you. In today\u2019s video I walk you through the process\nof hooking up Immich\u2019s machine learning components to a Windows 11 system,\nprimarily used as my personal gaming rig, running on WSL2, inside of a docker\ncontainer with Nvidia hardware acceleration support. And of course, we\u2019ll\ndiscuss how to do this on any GPU that is in your tailnet (even a friend's\nremote GPU!).\n\nThis video builds upon concepts we\u2019ve been exploring on the channel lately,\nsuch as running Tailscale in a docker container to add individual services to\nyour tailnet.\n\nCentral to our mission here at Tailscale is to help you create small, trusted\nnetworks with your friends, family and coworkers. Are you using Tailscale to\nthis end? Let us know with a post in our subreddit, in the Fediverse, or on X\n(formerly Twitter). Until next time, I\u2019ve been Alex from Tailscale.\n\n## Subscribe to Tailscale\u2019s blog\n\nWe have a deep commitment to keeping your data safe.\n\nToo much email?RSSX\n\n## More articles\n\nMay 01, 2024\n\n#### Tailscale and CrowdStrike Falcon for enhanced device posture management\n\nTinku Thomas, Anton Tolchanov, Paul Scott, Kristoffer Dalby, James Sanderson &\nRoss Zurowski\n\nApr 19, 2024\n\n#### April Tailscale newsletter\n\nParker Higgins\n\nApr 18, 2024\n\n#### SSO tax, cut\n\nCharlotte Brandhorst-Satzkorn\n\n## Try Tailscale for free\n\nGet started\n\nSchedule a demo\n\nContact sales\n\nProduct\n\nHow it worksPricingIntegrationsFeaturesCompare Tailscale\n\nUse Cases\n\nBusiness VPNRemote AccessSite-to-Site NetworkingHomelabEnterprise\n\nResources\n\nBlogEvents & Webinars\n\nCompany\n\nCompanyCareersPress\n\nHelp & Support\n\nSupportSalesSecurityLegalOpen SourceChangelog\n\nLearn\n\nSSH keysDocker SSHDevSecOpsMulticloudNAT TraversalMagicDNSPAMPoLPAll articles\n\nTerms of ServicePrivacy Policy\n\nWireGuard is a registered trademark of Jason A.
