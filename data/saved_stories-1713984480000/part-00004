Why?\n\nThere are two useful reasons, I think.\n\nFIRST, because we\u2019re unaware of all the real and imaginary boundaries our\nfriends have set up. If it were easy to solve the problem, they probably would\nhave. But they\u2019re making it hard because they have decided that there are\npeople or systems that aren\u2019t worth challenging. Loosening the constraints\nalways makes a problem easier to solve.\n\nAnd SECOND, because resistance is real. Solving the problem means moving\nahead, confronting new, even scarier problems. It might be easier to simply\nstay where we are, marinating in our stuck.\n\nWhen we care enough to solve our own problem, we\u2019ll loosen the unloosenable\nconstraints and embrace the new challenges to come.\n\nApril 21, 2024\n\nShare This\n\nFacebook\n\n### Share on Mastodon\n\nPrivacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.
