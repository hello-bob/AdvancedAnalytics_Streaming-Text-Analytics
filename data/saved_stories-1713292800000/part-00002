The park is the city\u2019s second most popular attraction after the Sagrada\nFamilia basilica.\n\nNow they have the bus to themselves after the city council arranged to have\nthe route removed from Google and Apple maps.\n\n\u201cWe laughed at the idea at first,\u201d said C\u00e9sar S\u00e1nchez, a local activist. \u201cBut\nwe\u2019re amazed that the measure has been so effective.\u201d\n\nLuz L\u00f3pez, 75, told elDiario.es: \u201cBefore, the bus was so full even people with\nwalking sticks couldn\u2019t get on.\u201d\n\nAlbert Batlle, the deputy mayor of security and coexistence on the city\ncouncil, said that as well as improving mobility around Park G\u00fcell, \u201cwe needed\nto eliminate references to the 116 on the internet\u201d.\n\nBatlle declined to admit or deny that the council had asked for the route to\nbe removed, while a Google spokesperson would only say they would not delete a\nbus route unless requested to do so by the council.\n\nS\u00e1nchez, who has been campaigning for eight years for the council to address\nthe problem, joked: \u201cThe next thing we need to do is to get the whole of Park\nG\u00fcell removed from Google Maps.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Barcelona\n  * Spain\n  * Europe\n  * Barcelona holidays\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### \u2018Summer will be monstrous\u2019: Barcelona wrestles with revival of mass tourism\n\n16 Jun 2022\n\n  * ### Catalonia plans law to protect historic shops as rents soar\n\n3 May 2022\n\n  * ### Controversial Barcelona airport expansion plan agreed\n\n3 Aug 2021\n\n  * ### Barcelona cannabis clubs face closure in new legal setback\n\n27 Jul 2021\n\n  * ### Surge in violent crime in Barcelona prompts calls for legal reform\n\n23 Aug 2019\n\n  * ### Barcelona mayor promises crackdown on cruise ships\n\n5 Jul 2019\n\n  * ### Barcelona port is worst in Europe for cruise ship air pollution\n\n7 Jun 2019\n\n  * ### Airbnb can\u2019t go on unregulated \u2013 it does too much damage to cities\n\n24 Oct 2018\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncomments\n\n  * ### Barcelona Airbnb host 'manages rentals worth \u00a333,000 a day'\n\n22 Oct 2018\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * Europe\n  * US\n  * Americas\n  * Asia\n  * Australia\n  * Middle East\n  * Africa\n  * Inequality\n  * Global development\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
