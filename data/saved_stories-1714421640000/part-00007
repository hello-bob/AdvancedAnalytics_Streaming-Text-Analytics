For\nexample, Glenn Gravatt compiled numerous such tricks in his book Encyclopedia\nof Self-working Card Tricks (1936), which was later compiled with Second\nEncyclopedia of Card Tricks (1936) to create Jean Hugard's classic text\nEncyclopedia of Card Tricks in 1937.^[1] Strictly speaking no magic is \"self-\nworking\", since tricks still need to be performed and presented correctly, and\nso some writers prefer the term \"auto-magic\", which was popularized by Michael\nBreggar in his monthly \"Auto-Magic\" column in The Linking Ring.^[2]\n\nMany self-working card tricks rely on mathematical principles, and can be\nreplicated by following the steps correctly. A simple example is the trick\n\"Magical 13\", where a deck of playing cards is secretly set up with all the\nsuits in order. Because cards of the same value are exactly 13 away from each\nother in this prearranged order, the spectator can cut the deck as often as\nthey like, but when they deal the deck into 13 piles, each pile will consist\nof four cards with exactly the same value.\n\nSome consider optical illusions and some science demonstrations, where the\nwonder comes from unexpectedness of a natural phenomenon, to fall into the\ncategory of self-working magic as well.\n\n## Examples[edit]\n\nExplanation of the Piano Trick: 1. Cards are put in pairs, except for the last\ncard, between the spectator's fingers and thumbs. 2. The cards are gathered\ninto two piles. 3. The illusionist pretends to magically move the single card\nto the smaller pile. 4. The smaller pile is shown to have three pairs and a\nsingle card.\n\nSome of the best card tricks in the world are self-working, one of the most\nnotable examples being Out Of This World (1942) by Paul Curry.\n\nMany people are first introduced to performing magic via self-working card\ntricks. Some of the most widely known self-working card tricks include the\nTwenty-One Card Trick, The Four Robbers, The Piano Trick, Spectator Cuts To\nThe Aces, The Spelling Bee, The Circus Card Trick, and Do As I Do.\n\n## Resources[edit]\n\nClassic texts on self-working tricks include Scarne on Card Tricks (1950) by\nJohn Scarne, Self-Working Card Tricks (1976) and similar books by Karl Fulves\npublished by Dover Publications, and the Card College Light trilogy by Roberto\nGiobbi.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Encyclopedia of Self-working Card Tricks Magicpedia.
