night after\nstaging a sit-in at the company's offices in New York and Sunnyvale,\nCalifornia, including a protest in Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian's office.\n\nThe arrests, which were livestreamed on Twitch by participants, follow rallies\noutside Google offices in New York, Sunnyvale and Seattle, which attracted\nhundreds of attendees, according to workers involved. The protests, led by the\n\"No Tech for Apartheid\" organization, focused on Project Nimbus \u2014 Google and\nAmazon's joint $1.2 billion contract to provide the Israeli government and\nmilitary with cloud computing services, including artificial intelligence\ntools, data centers and other cloud infrastructure.\n\nProtesters in Sunnyvale sat in Kurian's office for more than nine hours until\ntheir arrests, writing demands on Kurian's whiteboard and wearing shirts that\nread \"Googler against genocide.\" In New York, protesters sat in a three-floor\ncommon space. Five workers from Sunnyvale and four from New York were\narrested.\n\n\"On a personal level, I am opposed to Google taking any military contracts \u2014\nno matter which government they're with or what exactly the contract is\nabout,\" Cheyne Anderson, a Google Cloud software engineer based in Washington,\ntold CNBC. \"And I hold that opinion because Google is an international company\nand no matter which military it's with, there are always going to be people on\nthe receiving end... represented in Google's employee base and also our user\nbase.\" Anderson had flown to Sunnyvale for the protest in Kurian's office and\nwas one of the workers arrested Tuesday.\n\n\"Google Cloud supports numerous governments around the world in countries\nwhere we operate, including the Israeli government, with our generally\navailable cloud computing services,\" a Google spokesperson told CNBC, adding,\n\"This work is not directed at highly sensitive, classified, or military\nworkloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services.\"\n\nThe demonstrations show Google's increased pressure from workers who oppose\nmilitary use of its AI and cloud technology. Last month, Google Cloud engineer\nEddie Hatfield interrupted a keynote speech from the managing director of\nGoogle's Israel business stating, \"I refuse to build technology that powers\ngenocide.\" Hatfield was subsequently fired. That same week, an internal Google\nemployee message board was shut down after staffers posted comments about the\ncompany's Israeli military contracts. A spokesperson at the time described the\nposts as \"divisive content that is disruptive to our workplace.\"\n\nOn Oct. 7, Hamas carried out deadly attacks on Israel, killing 1,200 and\ntaking more than 240 hostages. The following day, Israel declared war and\nbegan implementing a siege of Gaza, cutting off access to power, food, water\nand fuel. At least 33,899 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip since that\ndate, the enclave's Health Ministry said Wednesday in a statement on Telegram.\nIn January at the U.N.'s top court, Israel rejected genocide charges brought\nby South Africa.\n\nThe Israeli Ministry of Defense reportedly sought consulting services from\nGoogle to expand its access to Google Cloud services. Google Photos is one\nplatform used by the Israeli government to conduct surveillance in Gaza,\naccording to The New York Times.\n\n\"I think what happened yesterday is evidence that Google's attempts to\nsuppress all of the voices of opposition to this contract are not only not\nworking but actually having the opposite effect,\" Ariel Koren, a former Google\nemployee who resigned in 2022 after leading efforts to oppose the Project\nNimbus contract, told CNBC. \"It's really just creating more agitation, more\nanger and more commitment.\"\n\nThe New York sit-in started at noon ET and ended around 9:30 p.m. ET. Security\nasked workers to remove their banner, which spanned two floors, about an hour\ninto the protest, according to Hasan Ibraheem, a Google software engineer\nbased in New York City and one of the arrested workers.\n\n\"I realized, 'Oh, the place that I work at is very complicit and aiding in\nthis genocide \u2014 I have a responsibility to act against it,''\" Hasan Ibraheem,\na Google software engineer based in New York City, told CNBC. Ibraheem added,\n\"The fact that I am receiving money from Google and Israel is paying Google --\nI am receiving part of that money, and that weighed very heavily on me.\"\n\nThe New York workers were released from the police station after about four\nhours.\n\nThe nine arrested workers in New York and Sunnyvale told CNBC that, during the\nprotest, they were locked out of their work accounts and offices, placed on\nadministrative leave, and told to wait to return to work until being contacted\nby HR.\n\nThe workers were also protesting their labor conditions \u2014 namely \"that the\ncompany stop the harassment, intimidation, bullying, silencing, and censorship\nof Palestinian, Arab, Muslim Googlers \u2014 and that the company address the\nhealth and safety crisis workers, especially those in Google Cloud, are facing\ndue to the potential impacts of their work,\" according to a release by the\ncampaign.\n\n\"A small number of employee protesters entered and disrupted a couple of our\nlocations,\" a Google spokesperson told CNBC. \"Physically impeding other\nemployees' work and preventing them from accessing our facilities is a clear\nviolation of our policies, and we will investigate and take action. These\nemployees were put on administrative leave and their access to our systems was\ncut. After refusing multiple requests to leave the premises, law enforcement\nwas engaged to remove them to ensure office safety.\"\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
