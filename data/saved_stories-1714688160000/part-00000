We believe\nanyone with a good idea and the ingenuity to bring it to life should have the\nopportunity to offer their app to the world. Only developers who reach\nsignificant scale (more than one million first annual installs per year in the\nEU) pay the CTF. Nonprofit organizations, government entitles, and educational\ninstitutions approved for a fee waiver don\u2019t pay the CTF. Today, we\u2019re\nintroducing two additional conditions in which the CTF is not required:\n\n  * First, no CTF is required if a developer has no revenue whatsoever. This includes creating a free app without monetization that is not related to revenue of any kind (physical, digital, advertising, or otherwise). This condition is intended to give students, hobbyists, and other non-commercial developers an opportunity to create a popular app without paying the CTF.\n  * Second, small developers (less than \u20ac10 million in global annual business revenue*) that adopt the alternative business terms receive a 3-year free on-ramp to the CTF to help them create innovative apps and rapidly grow their business. Within this 3-year period, if a small developer that hasn\u2019t previously exceeded one million first annual installs crosses the threshold for the first time, they won\u2019t pay the CTF, even if they continue to exceed one million first annual installs during that time. If a small developer grows to earn global revenue between \u20ac10 million and \u20ac50 million within the 3-year on-ramp period, they\u2019ll start to pay the CTF after one million first annual installs up to a cap of \u20ac1 million per year.\n\n### iPadOS\n\nThis week, the European Commission designated iPadOS a gatekeeper platform\nunder the Digital Markets Act. Apple will bring our recent iOS changes for\napps in the European Union (EU) to iPadOS later this fall, as required.\nDevelopers can choose to adopt the Alternative Business Terms for Apps in the\nEU that will include these additional capabilities and options on iPadOS, or\nstay on Apple\u2019s existing terms.\n\nOnce these changes are publicly available to users in the EU, the CTF will\nalso apply to iPadOS apps downloaded through the App Store, Web Distribution,\nand/or alternative marketplaces. Users who install the same app on both iOS\nand iPadOS within a 12-month period will only generate one first annual\ninstall for that app. To help developers estimate any potential impact on\ntheir app businesses under the Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU,\nwe\u2019ve updated the App Install reports in App Store Connect that can be used\nwith our fee calculator.\n\nFor more details, visit Understanding the Core Technology Fee for iOS apps in\nthe European Union. If you\u2019ve already entered into the Alternative Terms\nAddendum for Apps in the EU, be sure to sign the updated terms.\n\nGlobal business revenue takes into account revenue across all commercial\nactivity, including from associated corporate entities.
