At the same time, they can be\nquick to reject those they perceive as different. How does this contradiction\narise? And how can we help children develop a sense of morality and justice?\n\n\u201cOne time\u2014this was, like, a long time ago\u2014I was new in this school, but these\npeople at the school used to judge me because of my skin color and used to\ndisclude me and make fun of me,\u201d Alex, a student of about 10, said to\nclassmates as part of a study my colleagues and I conducted. (Students\u2019 names\nhave been changed for confidentiality.) \u201cI wanted to be their friend. I kind\nof just, like, ignored them, but they still found a way to get to me. So,\nlike, every single day I went crying to my mom and told her what happened. She\njust told me to ignore them, but that didn\u2019t help, and it just, like,\nescalated to the point where I had to see a counselor and stuff.\u201d\n\nFor many children, discrimination inflicts anxiety and misery and interferes\nwith their learning. Schools could be far more welcoming than most now are,\nand I and other developmental psychologists have an idea of how to help them\nget there.\n\nAfter decades of investigating children\u2019s moral development, my colleagues and\nI have come to understand the reasoning children use to deal with the\ndissonance between their desire to be fair and their need to belong to friend\ngroups. And we\u2019ve figured out how to help them think through and share their\nviews, particularly about what makes social exclusion unfair and why it\u2019s\nnecessary to stand up against stereotypes and biases.\n\nWe recently tested our intervention in a randomized, controlled trial, the\ngold standard for evaluating medical and social treatments, in a Maryland\nschool district. The program significantly improved children\u2019s ability to\nplace themselves in one another\u2019s shoes; enhanced their reasoning in moral\nconflicts; and helped to foster friendships across boundaries of ethnicity,\nclass and gender. The intervention facilitated Alex\u2019s sharing, after which\nanother student related their experience of exclusion. Responding with empathy\nand support, the class talked about how to resolve such situations.\n\nSuch training and discussions not only help to reduce children\u2019s prejudices\nbut also burnish their ability to resolve conflicts and make school less\nstressful. Most important, they have the potential to make future societies\nmore just and caring. As kids grow into adults, their ideas of \u201cus versus\nthem\u201d too often harden into prejudices\u2014and that has consequences. If George\nbelieves as an elementary school student that boys are better than girls at\nscience, it could influence whom he invites to join the science club in middle\nschool, as well as what he thinks as an adult about whether women can be good\ndoctors, scientists or pilots. Our program shows kids how to challenge such\nstereotypes with the hope of making society better for everyone.\n\nHow do people acquire a sense of justice, and how early does it emerge?\nPioneering Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget observed children\u2019s play in search\nof answers to such questions. He wanted to understand how they develop\nprecepts such as \u201cdo unto others as you would have them do unto you,\u201d\nformalized by philosopher Immanuel Kant as the \u201ccategorical imperative.\u201d In\nhis 1932 book, The Moral Judgment of the Child, Piaget reported that even to\nchildren, intentions matter: one kid might injure another, but if it was an\naccident, no one was at fault. To kids, treating others with equality and\nrespect is a matter of justice.\n\n## Related Stories\n\n  * ### AI Can Transform the Classroom Just Like the Calculator\n\nMichael M. Crow, Nicole K.

Developmental scientists now know that it starts early:\nbabies as young as eight months old who witness one puppet trying to climb a\nhill while other puppets either help or get in the way prefer the helpers to\nthe hinderers. Such preferences, based on early forms of empathy, are not yet\nexplicit moral judgments; those show up a couple of years later. By age three,\nchildren understand that hurting others is wrong. By age five, they start to\nshare candy equally. Even some animals have a sense of what is wrong, as\nethologist Frans de Waal of Emory University and others have demonstrated. In\nan experiment de Waal conducted with Sarah F. Brosnan, now at Georgia State\nUniversity, a capuchin monkey became furious when she got a piece of cucumber\nas a reward for handing the experimenter a rock while another monkey instead\ngot a real treat: a grape.\n\nChildren, like capuchins, are social beings, but human morality is exceedingly\ncomplicated and requires time to fully develop. As kids grow, family, friends,\nand others can help them understand why fairness and justice matter. My own\nlifelong interest in social justice may have something to do with my mother,\nwho was active in the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, and my grandfather,\nwho was a leader for workers\u2019 rights in San Francisco during the early 1950s.\nGrowing up in Berkeley, Calif., I attended schools with almost equal\nproportions of Black, white and Asian students. When I went to college in\nWorcester, Mass., to study child psychology and moral development, I was\nsurprised to discover that friend groups and dating circles were often\nsegregated by race and ethnicity. I now think these influences contributed to\nmy desire to understand how morality might win out over prejudice.\n\nAs an undergraduate, I worked with developmental psychologist William Damon,\nthen at Clark University, on one of his studies of how fairly children divide\nup resources. In these experiments, chocolate bars were given to students as a\nreward for making bracelets. Young children often gave more bars to kids of\ntheir own gender and age, but by nine or 10 years old they either divided them\nup equally or gave more to those who had made more bracelets.\n\nDuring my graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, I\nlearned that adults make decisions about morality in the context of group\nconventions and cultural rituals. Curious about how children would react when\nrules and norms conflicted with morality, I worked with my thesis adviser,\ndevelopmental psychologist Elliot Turiel, to offer children hypothetical\nscenarios and ask questions. If a team captain has to fetch a runaway ball for\ntheir team to stay in a tournament, should they do it even if it means\nignoring the fact that a little kid is being bullied nearby? Younger children\nfocused on getting the ball, but nine- or 10-year-olds were more willing to\nviolate a convention\u2014the obligation to take care of the team by retrieving the\nball\u2014to help the bullied child. As one student said, \u201cSomeone could get hurt,\nand even though you don\u2019t win anything, it\u2019s still good to see that human\nbeings don\u2019t fight.\u201d\n\nThese studies made me wonder what happens when a kid\u2019s friends are doing\nsomething wrong\u2014rejecting or harassing another kid because of their ethnicity,\nfor example. At the time, very few researchers were studying prejudice in\nchildhood. Social psychologists began studying prejudice in the 1950s because\nof the dire need to understand how the Holocaust happened. In his book The\nNature of Prejudice (Addison-Wesley, 1954), psychologist Gordon W. Allport\nargues against the idea of an \u201cevil\u201d leader being singularly responsible for\nthat horror, instead focusing on how most Germans had clustered around a\nshared national identity to the exclusion of Jews, Communists, and others whom\nthey perceived as different and threatening.\n\nIt was group dynamics rather than individual psychology that held the key to\nunderstanding prejudice, Allport postulated. He elucidated the mechanisms that\nfostered and maintained group loyalty (such as propaganda campaigns) and\npointed out that intergroup contact based on common goals, cooperation, equal\nstatus and the support of authorities could reduce prejudice.\n\nJen Christiansen; Source: \u201cTesting the Effectiveness of the Developing\nInclusive Youth Program: A Multisite Randomized Control Trial,\u201d by Melanie\nKillen et al., in Child Development, Vol. 93, No. 3; May/June 2022 (reference)\n\nBut how do prejudices emerge in the first place? After moving to the\nUniversity of Maryland in 1994 as a professor of human development, I teamed\nup with Charles Stangor, a member of the school\u2019s psychology department, to\nstudy how groups of kids acted when race and gender came into play. Children\ndidn\u2019t always apply their ideas of fairness, we found, when they conflicted\nwith the kids\u2019 group identity. For example, they thought it was wrong to\nexclude a boy from a ballet club but also said the other kids \u201cwould think\nthat John is strange if he takes ballet.\u201d Kids rarely referred to stereotypes\nwhen responding to situations of exclusion involving race, however. Clearly,\nwe had to investigate gender- and race-based exclusion differently.\n\nThank you for signing up!\n\nCheck out our other newsletters\n\nIn the early 2000s Martin D. Ruck of the City University of New York, David S.\nCrystal of Georgetown University and I learned that compared with teenagers\nwho attended homogeneous schools, those who went to more racially diverse\nschools and had friends of other races and ethnicities were more likely to see\nrace-based exclusion, such as having friends or dates only of the same race,\nas unfair.\n\nThese investigations showed that children identify with groups as early as\npreschool. These alliances provide social support, camaraderie and protection\nfrom bullies. But what happens when being a member of one group means going\nalong with unfair treatment of someone from an out-group? With Adam Rutland of\nthe University of Exeter and Dominic Abrams of the University of Kent, both in\nEngland, and my then graduate students Kelly Lynn Mulvey, now at North\nCarolina State University, and Aline Hitti, now at the University of San\nFrancisco, I started studying how children navigate conflicts between their\ngroup affiliations and their sense of justice. When did children and\nadolescents recognize that their group might be doing something unfair? Would\nthey tell their group that it was wrong, or would they just go along with it?\n\nWe showed children of diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds attending Maryland\npublic schools picture cards and asked, for example, whether they thought it\nwas all right for a kid in the picture (named, say, Jordan) to speak up if\ntheir after-school club was distributing money unfairly between itself and\nanother club at school. Children between eight and 10 years old were more\nlikely to think that Jordan would tell their friends they were doing something\nunfair and that those friends would then agree to do the right thing. More\nimportant, older children, aged 12 to 14 years, said it was okay for Jordan to\ntell their friends they were doing wrong, but the group would be unhappy and\nwould probably exclude them. In other words, as they grew older, children came\nto recognize the cost of arguing against a group norm\u2014a significant obstacle\nto challenging injustice.\n\nSo, for instance, a kid who wants to intervene when their group is teasing a\nfriend of another religion or ethnicity might hesitate to act because they\nanticipate being kicked out. Further, if they did get rejected, they could be\nviewed as an outcast by others, adding to the penalty for challenging the\nnorm. Offering hope, however, some kids were skilled at thinking about how to\npersuade their group to change for the better.\n\nThese studies made us wonder whether children would also favor their own group\nwhen sharing resources. In one study, led by my then graduate student Laura\nElenbaas, now at Purdue University, we asked children whether it was okay that\na school attended by Black students got fewer school supplies than a school\nattended by white students (and vice versa). We also gave them books and other\nsupplies and asked them to divide the items between the schools.\n\nAll the kids thought it unfair for one school to get less. But when it came to\nactually distributing the supplies, younger children had an \u201cin-group bias.\u201d\nFive- to six-year-olds gave more to the schools that had less to begin with,\nbut they were more likely to give when the disadvantaged school was attended\nby kids of their own race. In contrast, when giving to schools that had less\nto begin with, the 10- to 11-year-olds gave more supplies to the schools with\nBlack students than to the schools with white students because, as one kid\nsaid, \u201cI\u2019ve often seen that they have less when others have more.\u201d\n\nSurprisingly, there were no differences based on race and ethnicity of the\nchildren when it came to giving more to Black schools. A parallel study with\nmy former graduate student Michael Rizzo, currently at the University of\nIllinois Urbana-Champaign, similarly revealed that a kid\u2019s gender made no\ndifference in how they allocated stickers: they gave more to boys (not girls)\nwho made \u201cblue monster trucks\u201d and to girls (not boys) who made \u201cpink princess\ndolls.\u201d But as they got older, they allocated more equally.\n\nRegardless of race and gender, kids struggled to prioritize what was right and\njust over their prejudices and in-groups. The good news was that as children\nmatured, they moved toward what was fair.\n\nPutting together the lessons garnered over decades of research, our team\ndeveloped what we referred to as the social reasoning developmental model of\nhow children weigh fairness in the context of group dynamics. Morality is more\nthan recognizing that treating someone differently because of their skin\ncolor, gender or religion is unfair, we postulated. It requires understanding\nthat systemic biases create disadvantages for certain groups and recognizing\nwhen it is necessary to level the playing field.\n\nUsing this model, we formulated a set of further questions to understand how\nto help children become resisters of injustice, or \u201cagents of change.\u201d What\nfactors enabled them to reject unfair treatment of others? And because each\nchild belongs to multiple groups, what happens when these identities come into\nconflict? It\u2019s not only race and ethnicity but also wealth that confers\nstatus, for instance. Which matters more when it comes to exclusion? To answer\nthis question, Amanda R. Burkholder, now at Furman University in South\nCarolina, and I asked children aged eight to 14 to pick a new member of their\nclub. Children predicted that their peers would pick someone of similar wealth\neven if they were of a different race, indicating that economic class was a\nbetter predictor of common interest than race.\n\nBy 2015 we felt we knew enough about children\u2019s moral development to design a\nprogram to reduce bias and prejudice, promote friendships across social\nboundaries and help kids stand up to the unfair treatment of others. Above\nall, we wanted a program that dealt with children\u2019s own experiences rather\nthan the hypothetical scenarios we\u2019d used in our basic research.\n\nOur intervention program, called Developing Inclusive Youth, offers scenarios\ninvolving a morally complex situation and gives children a chance to think\nthrough their response and then discuss it with their classmates. After\ninitial testing, we coupled this program with training for elementary school\nteachers on creating a safe space for classroom discussions so children could\nthink and speak for themselves without being pushed toward any particular\nideas.\n\nDuring the program, elementary school kids between eight and 11 years of age\ngather in a classroom once a week for eight weeks. Each week they interact\nwith an animated online tool to reflect on and discuss a different type of\ninclusion or exclusion based on gender, race (Black or white), ethnicity\n(Asian, Arabic or Latinx), immigrant status or wealth status.\n\nFirst they get a laptop, put on headphones, then watch 15 minutes of a\nvignette. As an example, the program might present a situation in which a girl\nwants to work on a science project with a group of boys. One boy says girls\naren\u2019t good at science. Another challenges this notion, saying his sister is\ngood at science. What should they do? After the students watching the program\nhave privately entered their responses, the teacher leads them in a 30-minute\ndiscussion while they sit in a circle in the classroom.\n\nDuring one such session on science and gender, a student shared this story: \u201cI\nthink it was at the University of Maryland summer camp ... we were all inside\nthe dining hall eating dinner, and we saw some older kids do arm wrestles. So\n[one girl] went up to them and was like\u2014she went up to a boy and was like,\n\u2018Hey, do you want to arm wrestle?\u2019 And then he\u2019s like, \u2018You\u2019re a girl; you\ncan\u2019t beat me.\u2019 She ended up crushing him!\u201d\n\nThe class yelled in glee, asking how many seconds it took. Then another\nstudent offered, \u201cYeah, at my dad\u2019s work, they\u2019re getting the boys the best\njobs and the girls the worst jobs\u201d with less money, after which a third\nstudent said, \u201cThat\u2019s really unfair!\u201d\n\nThe randomized, controlled trial showed that children who went through this\nprogram were more likely to view exclusion as wrong; think of children of\nother groups as nice, hardworking and smart; and have higher expectations\nabout the math and science abilities of children outside their race, ethnicity\nor gender. Further, they were more eager to play with kids who were different\nfrom them and reported fewer social rejections. Many teachers told us they\nlearned new things about their students and became closer to them; the class\nbonded together more, and, most encouragingly, the students applied what they\nlearned to new contexts, such as when the class read a news article.\n\nImplemented widely, this program has the potential to better equip future\ngenerations to stand up to injustice. As one student put it, \u201cNo matter who\nyou are, you\u2019re just\u2014you\u2019re part of the civilization. You\u2019re part of humanity.\nYou\u2019re not, like, an alien from another planet.\u201d\n\n### From Our Archives\n\nMisdiagnosing Dyslexia. Sarah Carr; December 2023.
