That always felt a bit on\nthe nose for me given Capital One\u2019s traditional market focus, but be that as\nit may, it\u2019s one of my strongest associations with the word \u201cwallet.\u201d\n\nMany of my contemporaries and younger users no longer carry a physical leather\nor plastic wallet, to hold their identification, cards, and cash. All of these\neither live directly on their cell phone or, in some cases, hang out in its\ncase. But industry saw that transition coming a long time ago, and vied to get\nthe most valuable bits about money onto electronic systems in an enduring\nmanner. It called the customer-presenting elements of those systems\n\u201celectronic wallets\u201d, which quickly got shortened to \u201cwallets.\u201d Usage of this\nterm has bounced around over the years as various product teams have tried to\none-up their competitors or emphasize that the thing they are doing is merely\nwallet-adjacent or a superset of wallet functionality. Be that as it may, it\u2019s\nuseful to look around the world and say \u201cYeah, someone definitely pitched that\nas a wallet.\u201d\n\nIn 2024, I feel I have to add a clarification that a while ago the crypto\nfolks repurposed the word \u201cwallet\u201d to mean \u201ca collection of private keys\ncontrolled by a single entity\u201d and then \u201cthe software artifact which, given an\ninstruction to move money from A to B, would assemble that money from\nseparately kept accounts corresponding to a list of private keys and send the\nrelevant crypto network a candidate transaction for inclusion in the\nblockchain that would eventually move money from A to B.\u201d These are not the\nsorts of wallets under discussion. For crypto enthusiasts, I\u2019ll mention that\nit is instructive to contrast how crypto wallets (definition #2) make money\nversus how these wallets make money.\n\nOne more disclaimer: I previously worked at, and am currently an advisor to,\nStripe. Stripe does not necessarily endorse what I write in my personal\nspaces. Stripe also has a product (Link) which looks quite a bit like a wallet\nif you squint a bit.\n\n## The big question about wallets\n\nFrequently in finance and the technology surrounding it, relatively small\nquestions swing huge doors about e.g. regulatory and partner complexity for\nbringing something to market. The small question with large implications about\nwallets is \u201cCan it hold a balance of actual money?\u201d If it holds actual money,\nthat starts looking to regulators an awful lot like a deposit product.\n\nRegulators strongly prefer that deposits stay within the regulated banking\nsector. The single largest reason is that they\u2019re worried that households\u2019\nimmediately accessible stored funds stay safe and accessible. A major follow-\nup reason, less understood by non-specialists, is that regulated banks are\nbound to a long list of consumer protection items on the transaction level,\nnot the institution level. A lot of the abuse in the economy happens in $50\nand $5,000 increments, rather than multi-billion dollar increments. Regulators\nsleep happier knowing that this abuse happens at companies with teams of\noperators standing. Those operators will groan and chalk a disputed\ntransaction, instance of fraud, or glitch in the matrix up to the operational\nlosses budget rather than sticking a user with it.\n\n## Wallets show up early in the life of the Internet\n\nThe granddaddy of wallets was Paypal. In the early days of Internet commerce,\nnearly 30 years ago, many users were askance about typing their credit card\ndetails online. (In some countries, this would have been their banking\ndetails. The physical capability to pay with banking details lagged cards so\nhard in places like the U.S. and Japan that online commerce became synonymous\nwith card use early. This persisted for decades, though it is no longer\nstrictly true.)\n\nYounger users may not appreciate this, but there were front-page-of-the-\nnewspaper (... newspapers used to have paper pages, one of them was considered\nmost important, it was a different time...) stories that scared large parts of\nthe population that if you typed your credit card number into any keyboard it\nwould be stolen by hackers. There was a purported raft of fake e-commerce\nsites where bad guys would spend millions of dollars to create convincing\nfacsimiles of real e-commerce sites, just to steal your credit card details.\nThis was probably never actually a major threat by percentage of all stolen\ncards, not when these articles were written or afterwards, but this would not\nbe the first or last time that the media convinced itself of an untruth and\nthen was unable to find an industry insider to leak them a SQL query\ndispelling their fantasies. (The largest source of purloined credit card\ninformation is scaled breaches of card issuers or companies that were\nlegitimately presented hundreds of thousands or millions of cards in commerce.\nOrganized crime does not outscale capitalism; the threat is when it gets to\npiggyback illegitimately on capitalism.)\n\nAnd so that was the initial value proposition of Paypal: convey money from\nyour own payment instruments to others on the Internet (by volume, mostly eBay\nauction sellers) without needing to show those potential devious hackers your\nactual credit card number. That way, your exposure was upper-bounded at the\nsingle transaction in progress, and hopefully Paypal or your bank could\nintervene if something went wrong.\n\nBut then the eBay seller ended up with money... and what were they to do with\nit?\n\n## Stocks, flows, and whatever the heck a wallet is\n\nThere are classically two ways to make money in financial product innovation:\nyou charge the customer for stocks, an ongoing and often percentage-based fee\nto custody their assets for an arbitrarily long time, or you charge them for\nflows, a per-instance and sometimes scaling-with-size fee on transactions\nspecifically. Very frequently, from the perspective of a single user, stocks\nare priced and flows are free, or vice versa. In the basic bank account,\nstocks are priced (via the interest rate spread on deposits) but transactions\nare free or close to it. In credit card processing for businesses, stocks are\nfree-ish but flows (incoming transactions from customers) are priced.\n\nSo do wallets with embedded cash make money from stocks or flows? Yes.\n\nThe enduring genius of Paypal\u2019s wallet money was that moving money into\nPaypal\u2019s ecosystem cost a substantial amount of money, via card interchange.\nPaypal would try to set their pricing, historically about 2.9% plus about 30\ncents, such that it was above most interchange fees they\u2019d eat moving money\ninto the system. Then they would strongly encourage users to keep that balance\nwithin PayPal. This was natural for many casual eBay sellers: they were buyers\nas well, rather than being professional antique dealers, and leaving their\nInternet money somewhere on the Internet until they next needed money on the\nInternet worked out fine.\n\nWhen a customer did the next transaction, paying from their Paypal balance to\nanother Paypal user, the money moved internally at the speed and cost of a\ndatabase transaction: approximately instantaneously and too-cheap-to-meter.\nAnd then Paypal would try, with varying levels of success, to charge the full\n2.9% plus 30 cents, this time making 290 bps of margin rather than 80-120 bps\nor so of margin.\n\nSupercharging the margin possibilities by disintermediating the card\necosystems is the primary economic advantage of wallets capable of holding\nbalances. I bolded that for emphasis because non-specialists routinely assume\nthat the thing that looks like a bank deposit, and might actually be a bank\ndeposit under the hood, must earn revenue in the same way that bank deposits\nearn revenue, via net interest margin. It does and in high-interest\nenvironments, like the one we\u2019re currently living in (at least in the U.S.),\nthis is lucrative. Paypal earned nearly $500 million in interest on customer\nbalances last year, per their 2023 annual report. Most of that is very high\nmargin revenue, but it is not the ballgame. The real prize is having vastly\nbetter economics on the transactions.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see this when you zoom into the economics of a single account.\nPaypal claims accounts on average have about 40 transactions per year. I\nthink, ahem, that that includes some strategic ambiguity between personal and\ncorporate accounts, but let\u2019s assume a typical consumer might carry $200 in\nbalance and do 10 transactions each about $40 per year. So that\u2019s something\nlike $10 of margin from net interest and either about, oh, $1 of margin from\ntransactions if transactions are funded with the most expensive credit cards\nor about $15 of transaction margin if they\u2019re just repeatedly funded by the\nPaypal balance.\n\nAnd thus a subtlety: how do you do $400 in transactions out of a $200 balance\nwithout extending credit? You convince the consumer to let you top up their\nbalance via an ACH pull or similar method, which (unlike card transactions) is\nvery close to free.\n\n## What does an ACH pull cost?\n\nThe cost of an ACH pull... depends on a lot of things, like your negotiating\nsavvy and volume. But if you were to guess \u201cmaybe it costs 5 cents when you\u2019re\nbuying hundreds of millions of them\u201d, you would be in the ballpark.\n\nIf you quickly check what your payment processor of choice charges businesses\nto do their own ACH pulls, you will get quoted a number closer to e.g. 30\ncents. This should not surprise you; payment providers are in the business of\nearning margin on underlying payment rails in the same way that Coca Cola is\nin the business of earning margin on combinations of water, carbon dioxide,\nand corn derivatives. You can\u2019t just pay Coke for the corn and call it a day.\nCoke also structurally gets much better prices on corn than you do, because\nyou buy a few ears of corn from the supermarket and Coke buys the agricultural\noutput of Iowa.\n\nMany Bits about Money readers live in nations where interbank transfers do not\ngo over ACH rails and so mea maxima culpa for the above provincialism. In your\nnation, as well, interbank transfers are broadly speaking much less expensive\nthan most card transactions.\n\n... Unless you live in Japan, in which case your friendly local fintech\nproduct innovators could really talk your ear off about shenanigans to\ndecrease their money movement costs to support wallet operations. One example:\n\u201cIf it costs almost 200 yen to move money between banks but moving money\ninside a single bank is much closer to free, could we not simply establish a\nbank account at the top ten banks or so, covering more than 80% of our\ntransaction volume, and then move money between our own corporate accounts\ndaily at relatively low one-off cost then settle consumer transactions via\nsame-bank close-to-free ledger transactions?\u201d Which would be a somewhat sharp-\nelbowed thing for a salaryman to do to his bank.\n\n## Extensions on the basic wallet model\n\nSo that describes the basic business of a wallet with cash management: move\nmoney into the ecosystem at high cost to the wallet provider, move it within\nthe ecosystem at nearly zero cost to the wallet provider, move it out of the\necosystem at very low costs, and charge customers primarily for each instance\nof moving money.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve been doing this for a few years, your product teams will start to\nclamor that they have some attractive ideas which will make your wallet\nstickier with users, encourage your best customers to move more of their\ntransactions to your wallet, and decrease your payment costs. They\u2019ll also\nsometimes make you incidental revenue.\n\n## What\u2019s in your wallet? A new debit card!\n\nThe first option is going to be making a debit card backed by the wallet\nbalance, with the card issued by a banking partner that (in the U.S.) is\ncertain to be a Durbin-exempt institution. This is an obvious no-brainer, your\nproduct team will tell you. Currently, when your users want to get money out\nof the ecosystem to e.g. their bank accounts, you pay money. Why not earn\nmoney instead? Get a co-branded debit card offering and your banking partner\nwill provide you a revenue share on every transaction out. (How much is\nsomething of a trade secret, but if you were thinking somewhere in the 100 bps\nballpark, you\u2019d be close enough to interview as a PM at a fintech company.)\n\nCash App is, if you squint, a wallet. Block product managers would probably\nheavily dispute this characterization and say, truthfully, that their core\nuser feels like they\u2019re using Cash App rather than using their linked Bank of\nAmerica debit card when they are paying with Cash App. But economically, it\nlooks an awful lot like a wallet. And Cash App has morally speaking a debit\ncard (currently described as a prepaid card, the distinction between which\ndoubtlessly caused many, many meetings at Block and Sutton Bank) which Cash\nApp users can use anywhere in the economy that doesn\u2019t take Cash App directly.\nEach time they do, Sutton Bank earns a swipe fee, a portion of which becomes\nCash App transaction revenue you could read about in Block\u2019s 2023 annual\nreport. You can reasonably assume these payments are a very large chunk of\ntheir $498 million in revenue in that segment.\n\n## Monetizing payouts from wallets\n\nBut wait there is more! Sometimes there is money inside of your ecosystem that\nusers need taken out in a hurry. A common Cash App use case is texting your\nbuddy to ask them to spot you $20, or asking your roommate to send you their\nfraction of the rent. You might need to very quickly convert those few\nhundreds dollars into the kind of electronic money that doesn\u2019t get shoutouts\nin rap songs. Cash App will facilitate you doing this, for 0.5-1.75% with a 25\ncent minimum depending on exactly what rails you need the money to go over.\n\nFor example, if your landlord requires you to pay rent via Zelle or a check,\nyou might want to fairly urgently send money to your account at Bank of\nAmerica, which can do both Zelle and checks. There are two ways to do this:\nvia an ACH push payment to BoA, which would typically arrive in a few days, or\nvia a quirky form of \u201creversing a transaction that never happened\u201d on your BoA\ndebit card, which arrives almost instantly.\n\nIf I were a betting man, I\u2019d bet that Cash App charges 0.5% (25 cent minimum)\nif they push over the cheaper ACH rails and 1.75% (25 cent minimum) over the\nmore expensive debit card rails. I tried to test this with a $50 instant\nwithdrawal (called an \u201cinstant deposit\u201d by Cash App, and I\u2019d love to have been\na fly on the wall at that meeting) on an account connected to a Capital One\ndebit card and a Chase checking account. Without asking me for further details\nor telling me how it would route, Cash App quoted 88 cents (about 1.75%), sent\nit to Capital One, and delivered in an almost instant fashion as promised. I\nassume users with multiple bank accounts attached are an edge case, because I\nlike to be an optimist, but in the long history of finance some teams have\nbeen known to pick which of two options maximizes their own revenue.\n\n## What\u2019s in your wallet? A new credit card!\n\nBut wait there is more! Why only let your users spend the money they already\nhave, when you could get them to spend money they might not already have! You\nshould have a co-branded credit card offering. You will not issue a credit\ncard, no no no, Legal has explained multiple times at considerable length that\nregulators consider issuance of consumer credit to be an exclusive domain of\nthe regulated financial sector. You will partner with a member of that august\ncommunity and they will issue the cards, which will simply have your name on\nthem.\n\nWhy do you want to do this? One reason is it lets customers spend money which\ndoes not exist in your ecosystem, in your ecosystem, and instead of paying to\nmove money into your ecosystem you will get paid coming and going. The user\ncharges money to their card (which your co-branding partner will pay you a fee\nfor) and then it moves to some business through you (earning you another fee).\nYou are also highly likely to get another success fee for every card account\nyou successfully open (possibly after some de minimis level of spending on\nit), which you might use to incentivize users opening cards, might keep for\nyourself, or might split to do both.\n\nSee, for example, the Venmo card. Card issuers are getting more sophisticated\nin how they differentiate in offers, which possibly causes Paypal (Venmo\u2019s\nparent) to get more sophisticated in how they make offers, and so it is\npossible not all readers will see the same offer. But on my phone, Venmo is\nwilling to pay me $200 if I apply in next 2 weeks and spend $1,000 in the next\nsix months. One could construct a range of per-account and usage-based\npayments from Synchrony Bank to Paypal which makes this immediately incentive\ncompatible for Paypal. (As we have previously covered, it is not the case that\nit needs to be immediately incentive compatible. The marketing operations of\nfinancial services companies are sophisticated and model customer acquisition\ncosts over portfolios, and some accounts being negative margin contributive is\nnot a problem if the portfolio is sufficiently positive.)\n\nNow a fun thing about negotiating issuing relationships: everyone and their\ndog will, at this point, say that they have Alternative DataTM with Big DataTM\nlevels of transaction history which will allow the issuing bank to underwrite\nheavy users of the wallet better than they can their typical prospect.\nSpoiler: this won\u2019t actually end up mattering for credit decisions. FICO\nscores are unreasonably effective. Many, many, many teams have thought \u201cI bet\nI can get better loss rates if I supplement FICO scores with another data\nsource\u201d, and just about the only data sources for which that is actually true\nare illegal to use. (You can improve on FICO if you add zip codes... and a\njunior data analyst who puts zip codes in a spreadsheet to make predictions\nwill be told by Compliance that they need to understand what redlining is if\nthey ever hope to make senior data analyst.)\n\nThe big win on loss rates isn\u2019t the additive data that the wallet has. It is\nnegotiated terms between the wallet provider and the card issuer. The card\nissuer is not interested in individual consumers\u2019 decisions to pay or skip on\ndebts. They are emotionally unaffected by a single instance of identity fraud.\nNo, the issuer is attempting to buy a portfolio from the wallet provider, and\nthey will negotiate about that portfolio.\n\nA fairly common term is \u201cAcross all accounts we issue on the co-branded card,\nwe model a certain loss percentage. Now we\u2019re going to construct a graph. If\nyou slightly underperform that loss percentage, we\u2019re going to cut out payouts\nto you a bit. If you greatly underperform that loss percentage, we\u2019re going to\ncut them by more. And if you somehow have an absurdly fraudulent user base\nwhich nonetheless makes it past our own underwriting, we will demand a payment\nfrom you.\u201d\n\nAnd indeed, if you read Paypal\u2019s 2023 10-K, you will find many scintillating\nparagraphs like:\n\n> Consumers that have outstanding loans and interest receivable due to our\n> partner institution may experience hardships that result in losses\n> recognized by the partner institution, which may result in a decrease in our\n> revenue share earned in future periods. In the event the overall return on\n> the PayPal branded credit programs funded by the partner institution does\n> not meet a minimum rate of return (\u201cminimum return threshold\u201d) in a\n> particular quarter, our revenue share for that period would be zero.\n> Further, in the event the overall return on the PayPal branded credit\n> programs managed by the partner institution does not meet the minimum return\n> threshold as measured over four consecutive quarters and in the following\n> quarter, we would be required to make a payment to the partner institution,\n> subject to certain limitations. Through December 31, 2023, the overall\n> return on the PayPal branded credit programs funded by the partner\n> institution exceeded the minimum return threshold.\n\nTranslation: No worries, Paypal and their card issuing partner financial\ninstitution are mutually happy with the performance of the portfolio.\n\n## Put the wallet on the phone already!\n\nMany wallets exist these days as apps on your phone, but of course phone\nmakers have realized that the phone has replaced the leather wallet, and\nconsider the walletness of the phone to be as core a product feature as niche\nuse cases like making phone calls.\n\nAnd so two very, very successful wallets are Apple\u2019s wallet, which is more or\nless coextensive with Apple Pay (my apologies to some people in Cupertino who\nwould argue that point), whatever Google calls their wallet this week, and\nSamsung Pay.\n\nWe have previously covered that one thing the payments industry charges\nbusinesses for is delivering high-spending customers who will use their\nplastic/etc to spend more and spend more frequently. Apple\u2019s pitch to banks\nis, essentially: \u201cOK, you might buy that many well-heeled users like their\nAmerican Express card. That certainly sounds reasonable. Do they spend hours\nstroking their American Express card lovingly? Do they bring it out to gaze\nupon as they sit on the toilet? No? OK, we think they care about our plastic-\nand-glass artifact much more than they do about Amex\u2019s plastic-and-glass\nartifact then. But good news. We can digitize your thing that users yawn about\non the thing that they love, and then it will outcompete all the other payment\nmethods because it is not in their wallet, it is in the palm of their hand\nbasically all of their waking hours.\u201d\n\nThis was pretty contentious, but banks agreed to pay Apple for the privilege\nof inclusion in this wallet. Partially this was because Apple might have said\nsomething rhyming with \u201cIf you don\u2019t do this, we will find a two-sided payment\nnetwork willing to do business with us. If we can\u2019t find them, we will build\nit, and people will use it, because they like us more than they like you.\u201d\n\nApple has been publicly reported to make 15 bps on each transaction which goes\nover Apple Pay. Google reportedly doesn\u2019t make anything for intermediating\ntransactions, which if you believe it might suggest something about the\nrelative executional capabilities of Apple and Google on non-core products.\n\n## That smells like an ads business\n\nMany, many scaled Internet firms have looked at the above economic models and\ndecided to jump into the wallet business. The economics are extremely\ncompelling and they are additive to almost any business which already needs to\nmove money around on behalf of users.\n\nThis has occasioned some laughter with how they compete against each other:\n\nYou\u2019ll note that not all of these are wallets, but after you have a wallet,\nand you have relationships with transacting businesses, it is very natural to\nadd a checkout experience.\n\nNow put on your consumer Internet product manager hat.\n\nHere we have a number of different firms vying for the attention of a user,\nwhere the experience between those firms all leads to essentially the same\noutcome (the user bought the good/service for a price from the business),\nwhere there might be a bit of user preference, but where many users are highly\npersuadable.\n\nDo you know what a good consumer Internet product manager will say at this\npoint? \u201cThis smells like an ads business. Do you have any idea how much money\nads businesses make? It\u2019s absurd.\u201d\n\nNow if you\u2019re a product manager who prioritizes the outcomes of the\ntransacting businesses you represent, you might have a prioritization\nalgorithm other than \u201cwho paid me the most for placement.\u201d For example, if you\nwere a business choosing your own ordering of those providers, you might say\n\u201cI really prefer to maximize net margin rather than simply maximizing the side\npayment. I am in business to sell things to people for money, after all, and\nthis checkout page is only incidental to that. I have a team of people who\noptimize my website to sell more things to more people for money. I should\nkick this question to them.\u201d\n\nSurprising almost everyone, almost no business below the scale of the largest\nbusinesses in the world, and few enough of them, actually has a team of people\nwho run experiments on their checkout flow to optimize for conversion rates\n(percentage of people who successfully check out). This was dumbstriking to my\ncolleagues at Stripe when I told them it and then they went on to hear \u201cOh\ngreat idea but those people don\u2019t exist so yeah not doing it right now maybe\nnext year\u201d from some of the biggest names in capitalism, for many consecutive\nyears.\n\nSo Stripe took advantage of rendering the checkout flow for very, very many\ncustomers in parallel and introduced dynamic optimization of presentation of\npayment methods (including wallets) at checkout. This takes advantage of\nprevious user preference in various geographies, so that e.g. people\ntransacting in America get prompted for cards like they probably expect and\npeople transacting in Japan see both cards but also popular Japanese payment\nmethods. The conversion rate impact is... much larger than many people guessed\nprior to doing it. It was so large that Stripe built out tooling to let\nbusinesses fine-tune availability of payment methods if they think they\nunderstand their customers better than the learning machines will guess at.\n\n## Speaking of Stripe and wallets...\n\nI\u2019d be hiding the ball a bit if I didn\u2019t mention that Stripe has a wallet-\nadjacent offering called Link. (Stripe describes it as a \u201cfast-checkout\nsolution.\u201d) Let me reiterate that Stripe does not necessarily endorse what I\nsay in my personal spaces.\n\nMost wallets are designed to make the wallet provider money via various\nrevenue streams. (No judgment here! Building things people love and charging\nindirectly for them is a legitimate way to earn a living!) Link is designed to\nconvert very, very well, and to get networks effects for businesses. You can\nsee it in action if you\u2019re curious, but if you\u2019re a regular reader\nprobabilistically I think you have already seen it just transacting on the\nInternet. Link converts very well, and you'll understand why when you see how\nquick checkout is the second time you encounter it.\n\nA business can allow customers who start a checkout with them sharing\nidentifying information like e.g. email address or phone number to quickly\nreuse payment credentials that they Link-ed in a previous transaction at that\nbusiness or another business using Link. Since that is a pretty sizable\nfraction of all businesses using Stripe, the user attempting to transact is\nhighly likely to have used a currently-available payment method before that\nLink knows about, which allows them to re-use it without having to do anything\nbarbaric like fish out a piece of plastic and redundantly type numbers on a\ntelephone.\n\nA fun bit of ancient history: once someone was visiting the Stripe Tokyo\noffice shortly after I joined, and I wanted to show off that I had figured out\nhow to query an internal data store, so I said \u201cWhat\u2019s your over/under on the\npercentage of cards used this year that we have seen before?\u201d That number was\npretty mindboggling even in 2016, and an obviously good marketing point. I\nchuckle a bit every time I see it (or its descendants) quoted. I have left,\nbut some descendant of that SQL query will probably keep getting run until it\nasymptotes near 100%.\n\nLink is a product born out of a similar realization: if the user has typed in\ntheir card/etc details once, and if they\u2019re OK with it, they should be allowed\nto redundantly type those as infrequently as possible. This is an obvious user\nexperience win. Businesses should like it, too, to the extent it outconverts\nother ways of presenting checkout, which Stripe is (on their behalf)\ndynamically measuring all of the time. Stripe likes it because improvements to\nconversion rate at the margin means Stripe gets to charge its fees on more\ntransactions.\n\nNow you can probably imagine another good business rationale: Stripe\u2019s two\nlargest costs are a) smart people and b) card interchange. One of these is fun\nto cut.\n\nMany customers have strong preferences about how they conduct transactions.\nThey might e.g. really like their credit card rewards. For those users, sure,\nlet them do the thing they want to do.\n\nFor other users who do not have strong preferences, perhaps because they are\nnot in the socioeconomic strata that directly benefits from rewards programs,\nyou can have businesses that are sensitive to the cost of interchange\nsubsidize an incentive for typing a low-cost payments credential into a mobile\nphone once. That business might have repeat custom with those users, and\nrecoup that incentive over lowering their payments cost on many, many\ntransactions over months or years.\n\nThink, for example, a ride sharing service. The core customer rides twice a\nday, every weekday, for arbitrarily long periods of time, and every time the\nbusiness charges them they pay the issuing bank again for making the\nacquaintance of that customer. If the ridesharing business could convince the\ncustomer to pay with their bank account instead, that would be beneficial\nenough over the term of that relationship that the ridesharing business could\ndirectly pay for that simple one-time action.\n\nThen, the next time that rider goes to check out at another business, if they\nhave agreed to save that payment method to Link... that business passively\nbenefits from lower payment costs.\n\nIn essence, it\u2019s a scaled renegotiation between the businesses that ultimately\npay for payments and the providers of payment services: we understand the\nlogic that we pay more for customers that really love you. If they really love\nyou, great, you won their hearts and will clearly continue to win their\nbusiness. If on the other hand your customer perceives your service as\ncommoditized... then we will buy payment services from a commodity provider of\nthem.\n\nThe price of payment services is a contentious topic between businesses and\nthe businesses that operate payment rails. There has been substantial\nlitigation about credit card interchange fees in the U.S., for example. We\u2019ll\nhave to go into detail about it some other time.\n\nAs one tiny piece of that, Walmart has opposed a settlement, because Walmart\nexplained to the judge that it has the economic heft to negotiate serially\nwith e.g. the largest 20 banks in the U.S. on interchange and would do so if\nVisa and Mastercard got out of the way. I take no particular position on the\nmerits, but most companies do not have nearly the scale of Walmart or the\noperational capability to pick up the phone and do months-long bespoke\nnegotiations with one bank, to say nothing of 20 of them. Walmart makes this\npoint at length to the judge; they don't want the deal most companies will\nget.\n\nBut why shouldn't the Internet get the deal the Internet could negotiate, if\nthe Internet was capable of negotiating on its own behalf? Stripe, as a side\neffect of a wallet-like product, enables a distributed, techno-social\nrenegotiation of payment costs on behalf of the Internet. It's even\naesthetically Internet; it's not a single big bang negotiation ratified by a\njudge, but rather the aggregate of millions of individual purely voluntary\ndecisions interacting with each other. This brings a large number of small-to-\nhuge businesses, and the customers using them, to a side of the table. And\ngiven that side of the table represents something like a percent of global\nGDP, it might get listened to.\n\nAnatomy of a credit card rewards program \u2192\n\n## Want more essays in your inbox?\n\nI write about the intersection of tech and finance, approximately biweekly.\nIt's free.\n\n\u00a9 2021-2024 Kalzumeus Software, LLC\n\n", "frontpage": false}
