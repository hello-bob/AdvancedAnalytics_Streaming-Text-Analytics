I'm\nputting this here for archival purposes.\n\nI have aphantasia, meaning that I can't form mental images at will. Nor, in my\ncase, sounds, smells, flavors, tactile sensations, or emotions. When I close\nmy eyes, I enter a blank world. Here I'll try to express what that is like for\nthose who don't have aphantasia.\n\nI've had the opportunity of participating in a research project on aphantasia\nat a major university. By \"participating\", I mean \"letting them take detailed\nMRI snapshots of my brain as I look at pictures, try to imagine killer whales,\nand other things that brains do\".\n\nI've also been engaging with some aphantasia communities online for a few\nmonths and showering questions on my friends and family members who don't have\naphantasia. These are my notes on what I've observed.\n\nWhat is it like to not have a mind's eye (and \"mind senses\")? Does it mean\nthat aphants (slang for people with aphantasia) have no imagination? Not at\nall!\n\nInside the fMRI machine, I've been asked to do one exercise more than any\nother: I close my eyes and try imagining a snowmobile, then a top hat, then a\ncamel, etc. I'd never tried to imagine specific things so intensely before, so\nI took the opportunity to study my experience.\n\n(Disclaimer: what follows is my own experience and interpretation. From my\nconversations with other aphants I've found that, even within this minority,\nthere's a lot of variation in experience. I can't say I represent all of them.\nAlso, I know very little neuroscience!)\n\nAnyway, describing this stuff is exceedingly difficult, and I can only begin\nto do it now after months of daily, intense thinking and self-observation. So\nhere we go.\n\nWhen I actually see a cat with my eyes, something like this is happening.\n\n(Here by \"qualia\" I mean the low-level sensation of perceiving something, i.e.\n\"ah, I'm seeing a cat\", with all baggage that my past experiences of cats\nmight have attached to it. This definition might be a bit different from that\nused by some philosophers.)\n\nNow, when a non-aphant imagines a cat, something like the following seems to\nhappen. The photons aren't there, but the experience starts from the mental\nimage (or at least, it happens in parallel with the qualia).\n\nOn the other hand, when I try to imagine a cat, the following seems to be\nhappening. I still get the \"ah, I'm seeing a cat\" feeling, I still recall a\nlot of concepts related to cats, and I may even half-believe that I have a cat\nin front of my closed eyes. But I have no image in my head.\n\nThe same is true if you replace \"cat\" with \"house\", \"beach\", \"my mother's\nface\", etc. I can imagine all those things in the sense that I focus on them\nand I can retrieve lots of information about them, except the sensory data.\nAlso, the data feels very faint, distant.\n\nIs it all completely abstract, then? Not exactly. Not in my case, at least. I\nhave a rather well-developed spatial sense, meaning that I can remember the\nrelative positions of things in space, and their rough proportions. I can\nposition myself relative to the things I'm imagining and imagine myself\ntraveling along them, turning them around in space, etc. I can even orient my\n(closed) eyes in the direction of any part of an object.\n\nSo when I imagine something physical like a cat, I don't see it, but I \"feel\"\nit as a collection of spatial relations. Something like this:\n\n(note: I don't literally see words/letters; and yes, the legs are literally a\nsingle fuzzy concept instead of four, until I focus on them.)\n\nSo I can tell you (very roughly) how far from me I'm imagining it, whether its\nhead is pointing left or right, and how it is moving. Of course, I don't see\nany of that, I have it as a quasi-3D spatial model only.\n\nThe thing is, this imagined object has almost no details. I can see more\ndetails, but I have to work to summon them consciously. I can think \"now I'm\ngoing to focus on the head of the cat... hmm, a cat has whiskers, its nose is\ntriangular and its cheeks are like two round furry pads\". So my spatial model\nfades into this:\n\nIn other words, I can focus my consciousness on certain parts of the object\nI'm imagining, and actively recall some of their sub-parts and their relative\npositions. But they come a few at a time, and they're limited to the details\nthat I have consciously recalled.\n\nThis spatial model isn't an organic whole, each part smoothly attached to the\nnext: it's a patchwork of loosely linked \"islands\" of concepts floating in a\ncertain pattern. And it lacks so many details, big and small, that I'm not\nfocusing on at the moment.\n\nOften, after trying to imagine an object, I look up an image of it (I just did\nthat for the cat) and slap my forehead: \"ah, of course a cat also has eyes!\" I\nknew that all along, but I didn't focus my attention on those parts, so they\nwere absent from my previous spatial model.\n\nIf I try again now with my eyes closed, my imagination will be like this,\nbecause those details are fresh in my memory.\n\nI'm good at drawing, but I have to either look at a reference, or do several\nsketch iterations to gradually turn my un-seen spatial model into a coherent\npicture on paper. (Many aphants claim they can't draw at all, while others are\ngreat artists, so lots of variation here too.)\n\nThat's all for now: aphants can imagine things just fine, but it seems to be\ndifferent from how others do it. My hope is that by studying what does and\ndoesn't differ between aphants and non-aphants, researchers will be able to\ndeepen our understanding of everyone's brains. \u25cf\n\nAll content is licensed under\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\n", "frontpage": false}
