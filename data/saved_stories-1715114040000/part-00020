The 11-inch model is 5.3mm thick and weighs\nless than a pound, while the 13-inch model is just 5.1mm thick and weighs a\nquarter pound less than its predecessor. Apple notes that this makes the new\niPad Pro the thinnest Apple product ever. It features an improved thermal\ndesign thanks to graphite sheets in the main housing and copper in the Apple\nlogo.\n\nThe iPad Pro's Ultra Retina XDR OLED display uses two panels in a tandem\ndesign to deliver even better fullscreen brightness of up to 1,000 nits for\nSDR and HDR, and 1,600 nits of peak HDR brightness. It delivers deeper, true\nblacks, more detail in shadows and low light, brighter highlights and improved\nluminance, and it is more responsive to content in motion.\n\nThe M4 chip is built with second-generation 3nm technology and features a new\ndisplay engine, as well as hardware accelerated mesh shading and ray tracing.\nIt delivers up to 50% faster CPU performance than the M2 in the previous iPad\nPro and four-times faster rendering performance.\n\nThe iPad Pro's 12-megapixel front-facing camera has been moved to the side of\nthe device for an improved video calling experience. The rear-camera now\nsupports ProRes video recording and Smart HDR 4. It also now features an\nAdaptive TrueTone flash for better document scanning.\n\nThe iPad Pro is available with a nano-texture display option for the first\ntime. The device's enclosure is made 100% recycled aluminum and it comes in\nSilver and Space Black.\n\nThe 11-inch model starts at $999 and the 13-inch model starts at $1,299. It is\navailable to order starting today and launches on Wednesday, May 15.\n\nRelated Roundup: iPad Pro\n\nBuyer's Guide: 11\" iPad Pro (Buy Now), 12.9\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)\n\nRelated Forum: iPad\n\n[ 316 comments ]\n\n## Top Rated Comments\n\nmashinhead\n\n2 hours ago at 07:19 am\n\nApple is becoming the Gillette of product feature naming...
