Three-\nbedroom apartments out in New Taipei City routinely sell for 20x the median\nannual income, making housing significantly less affordable here than even San\nFrancisco, Sydney, Vancouver, and London1. The result is a generation priced\nout of housing and a dramatic collapse in family creation.\n\nLearning this was a great shock to me. Taipei seems to be covered in\nhighrises, and with pragmatic and low-cost construction, I assumed houses\nwould be small but reasonably affordable, as in Japan. Instead, dysfunctional\nurban planning has created one of the world's least affordable cities.\n\nView from Taipei 101. Modern redevelopment in the foreground, older precincts\nin the midground, office parks and, eventually, mountains to the rear.\n\nThe crisis has deep roots in Taiwanese history and the transition to\ndemocracy.\n\nIn 1945, the Japanese colony of Taiwan was ceded to the Chinese Nationalists\n(Kuomingtang, or KMT), who began a series of disastrous experiments in\ncollectivization. All senior judiciary, managerial, and administrative\npostings were replaced by KMT loyalists. Businesses and property were seized\nand amalgamated into state-sanctioned monopolies who, it was believed, would\nbe more efficient under the guidance of benevolent state than in the hands of\nprivate individuals.\n\nAs with every other occasion this has been attempted, the result was a\ncollapse in the production of goods and agricultural products and a breakdown\nin public services and order. Inflation skyrocketed, shortages grew, and the\nprice of rice rose over 100x. Protests broke out throughout the country.\nMartial law was declared, and the protests were violently put down, resulting\nin the deaths of some 20,000 Taiwanese.\n\nSevere inflation and economic stagnation continued until after the communist\ndefeat of the KMT on the Mainland prompted the retreat of the nationalist\narmies to Taiwan, and a period of deep soul-searching2. A new economic model\nbegan to emerge favouring a capable state providing stability, education,\ninfrastructure, and R&D investment, all aimed at the flourishing of private\nenterprise.\n\nLand reform was a core part of this programme. Public farmland was sold, land\nrents were capped, and the \u2018Land to the Tiller\u2019 scheme provided state\ncompensation to landowners in return for redistribution of land to their\ntenant farmers, establishing the pattern of tiny family farms that dominate\nTaiwan\u2019s countryside.\n\nSmall family plots in Miaoli County. Photo by Taiwankego under a Creative\nCommons licence.\n\nWidespread land ownership gave many a stake in society and agricultural\nproduction grew rapidly3, but it also created difficulties for urban\ndevelopment. Now, many owners would need to cooperate to bring enough land to\nmarket for redevelopment into a new apartment complex or factory. Meanwhile,\nnegotiating with a single large landowner about land for public infrastructure\nwill always be more straightforward than dealing with hundreds. The KMT\ngovernment responded by exercising broad unilateral powers. Land was\ncompulsorily acquired, rezoned, and redeveloped with the threat of\nimprisonment to any local opposition.\n\nWhile public engagement with the state was discouraged throughout most of the\nKMT era, local communities remained highly connected through family and\nbusiness ties. Consequently, as democratic reform began to gather momentum in\nthe 1980s, resentment over the state\u2019s treatment of local issues was a major\ndriver for reform. The result was a general limiting of the power of the\nstate, and a dramatic shift in Taiwanese land planning in particular. Now, 80%\nof local residents (including those surrounding the area) need to approve\nbefore redevelopment can occur.\n\nTaiwan is a small, extremely mountainous island with a shortage of buildable\nland. This is particularly true of Taipei, which sits in a mountain basin. Yet\nmany 'greenfield' areas at the edges are still theoretically available for\nhousing. In practice, modern redevelopment is proving virtually impossible. In\none case I looked at, a ~1sqkm rural zoned site on the edge of Taipei has been\nin rezoning negotiations for 15 years, lacking the required supermajority\nagreement to proceed. The surrounding area is heavily urbanised, with frequent\nbus links, a nearby university, and even a metro line on the way, but until a\nsupermajority can come to full agreement on a plan (including on such details\nas where roads and public facilities will be situated), no redevelopment can\noccur.\n\nWhile redevelopment laws changed after democratisation, the legacy zoning did\nnot. The effects on housing were not felt immediately as development capacity\nremained4. In fact, spurned by strong economic growth and rising incomes\n(household income quadrupled in ten years from 1986), the 1990s were a boom\ntime for Taiwanese housing construction. The number of completed residential\nunits reached as high as 300,000 units/year in the mid-90s. It was not to\nlast. Given the difficulties of further rezoning, capacity for housing\ndevelopment shrank rapidly. By 2000, annual completions had crashed to less\nthan 100,000. Supply failed to keep up with demand and prices began their\nrapid rise. Today, despite every incentive to build and sell at record-high\nprices, little construction takes place. Taipei has only built 25,000 units in\nthe last five years.\n\nTaipei's zoning is deceptive. The city lacks a typical centre, and tall\napartment buildings are permitted alongside most arterial roads, creating the\nimpression they\u2019re allowed everywhere. In fact, most of the city is limited to\na maximum of 5-6 stories, limiting population density to around\n20,000people/sqkm5, similar to Central Paris, and creating the characteristic\nurban form of the city:\n\nTaipei\u2019s zoning is much more restrictive than it first appears. Most of the\nbuildings you see above cannot be rebuilt today due to maximum building area\nand floor area ratios (BAR and FAR respectively). The BAR limits the size of\nnew buildings to 50-60% of the development site, while the FAR restricts the\ntotal private floor area of the building to 225-250% of the area of the site.\nThis means, for example, a 1000sqm site is allowed to have a building size of\nup to 500sqm, with a maximum of 2500sqm of private apartments. This means the\ndefault permitted redevelopment is a five-story building on half the site6,\nultimately providing a maximum of half the dwelling capacity of the existing\nbuildings.\n\nEach of the mini-blocks above is comprised of about 15 buildings of 5 stories\neach, each dwelling on a separate title. Let\u2019s imagine a developer manages to\nbuy all 75 of these at market prices (i.e. without any existing owners\ncatching wind of a potential redevelopment and demanding a higher price).\nThese dwellings lack modern amenities like large windows, elevators, and\npassive cooling, and they sell for about $13-15m NTD each7. However, for\nreasons that will soon become evident, many of these dwellings are poorly\nmaintained and have lower sales prices. Optimistically, $12m on average, for a\ntotal market value of the block of $900m NTD.\n\nA new apartment will sell for a substantial premium, at around $20m NTD.\nHowever, with B/FAR, a new building will only provide around half the yield,\nat around 38 dwellings. This means the total market value of the new building\nis only $760m! Despite replacing a poorly maintained building with a brand new\none, and entirely absorbing construction and transaction costs (legal fees,\nagent fees, sales taxes, sweeteners for holdout owners, etc.), our\nhypothetical developer has only managed to provide fewer homes and destroy\n$140m of value.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder then, despite continued low construction costs and the\nstaggering growth of the Taiwanese economy, the majority of the cheaply\nconstructed housing of the 1960s and 1970s remains today. They\u2019re uneconomic\nto replace, and as they continue to age, increasingly uneconomic to even\nmaintain.\n\nHighlights from a quick structural survey of a single block. Deep cracks,\nwater damage, exposed rebar, poor wiring. Every building of this era had major\nmaintenance issues clearly visible from the street.\n\nThe strategic thinking behind the use of B/FAR is to manage the effects of\ndensity on public infrastructure. Despite the success of the Metro, Taipei has\nfallen behind on providing many public services. Water supply is consistent,\nbut not considered drinkable due to poor piping. Wastewater blockages are\ncommon. Footpaths are of poor quality. Local parks, swimming pools, and\ncommunity centres are often dated, suffering from severe maintenance problems,\nand stretched beyond capacity.\n\nAllowing more people to live in a district only increases the pressure on\nthese services. The government policy response tries to incentivise developers\nto provide public amenity in return for additional FAR allowances.\nCircumstances vary across different jurisdictions, but as examples:\n\n  * +50% FAR for providing additional carparking for public lease\n\n  * +30% for providing a public plaza area on-site\n\n  * +15% for a footpath or qi-lou (an inset footpath that sits below the first-floor)\n\n  * +10% for tree planting along the site boundary\n\n  * +10% for providing an onsite gym/swimming pool/lounge/library, etc.\n\nFAR incentives are capped by law to no more than an additional 150%8. However,\ndevelopers can also buy and transfer unused FAR rights from other properties\nin the city (making a mockery of the idea that the policy helps to control\ndensity within a local area). Add enough FAR bonuses and rights together, and\nyou eventually arrive at a viable project providing enough gross profit to\ncover transaction costs, construction costs, interest costs, taxes, and return\na healthy enough profit to incentivise redevelopment:\n\nThe situation is completely insane. In return for some of the world\u2019s least\naffordable housing, the city receives scraps of mostly theoretical public\namenity. Unnecessary second footpaths, essentially inaccessible public plazas,\nand tiny libraries and swimming pools that go unused even by building\nresidents. These push up construction and maintenance costs for minimal public\nbenefit.\n\nA pointless second public footpath has been provided by the developers of this\napartment building in New Taipei City. It ends abruptly at the property\nboundary.\n\nTaiwan is a young democracy. Most political attention is absorbed by the\nissues of cross-strait relations, Taiwanese identity, and the question of\nformal independence. The recent presidential election was widely regarded as a\nreferendum on these issues. Given this focus, it seems to me that Taiwan has\nyet to develop a vibrant \u2018middle-layer\u2019 of public discourse on issues like\nhousing, defence, and education. People talk about these topics with their\nfriends, but a robust and well-informed public discussion supported by think-\ntanks, universities, and other such institutions is still sorely lacking.\n\nWhatever the reason, Taiwan has yet to address the fundamental issue of a\nsupply shortfall. Instead, the analysis of local media and politicians remains\nsuperficial, and focuses instead on managing essentially inelastic housing\ndemand. Well-intentioned government policy here has often making the problem\nworse and compromising other strategic goals.\n\n####\n\nCounterproductive Taxes\n\nThe government levies a range of property taxes. These taxes incentivize\ncertain types of behaviour while disincentivising others. For example, Taiwan\nlevies taxes on \u2018amusement places\u2019 like nightclubs, theatres, music venues,\nmagic shows, and dance halls. The tax explains Taipei\u2019s relative lack of these\nfacilities, and also the abundance of bars, cafes, restaurants, and other\ngathering places that escape having to pay the tax.\n\nThe key taxes affecting the supply of residential property in Taiwan are land\ntaxes, housing taxes, and taxes on the sale of housing.\n\nWhen tax is charged on the value of the land (rather than what sits above it)\nit encourages landowners to make valuable investments in that site. An\nalternative approach is to tax the total \u2018capital value\u2019 of the property. This\nencourages the opposite - land banking of vacant lots, and smaller investments\nthan otherwise to minimise the tax burden.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s approach is a mix of the two: a broad-based land value tax that\ngenerally encourages efficient use of land, but combined with a housing value\ntax that discourages housing in particular and allows for a lower land value\ntax rate. Further, an exemption is made in the land tax law for parking lots,\nagricultural warehouses, and cram schools9. In a country crying out for more\nhousing, the net result of these laws is that housing is discouraged while\nvast swathes of premium real estate are wasted on surface parking lots and\nlow-value commercial buildings.\n\nIt gets worse! An appropriately titled \u2018special privileged tax rate\u2019 for\nhousing taxes is offered for owner-occupied properties. This deduction ranges\nfrom 66% to an 80% discount in New Taipei City. In terms of their contribution\nto the upkeep of the city, this effectively means those lucky enough to own\ntheir own home are subsidised by everybody else.\n\nTaiwan also places a range of taxes on the creation of property. New property\ndeeds are taxed at 4% of the value of the property. Partition of an existing\nproperty is charged 2% of the combined value. These taxes discourage capital\ninvestment in property (relative to other forms of investment like overseas\ncapital markets) and discourage partition of property to enable more people to\nlive in a given area of land.\n\nIn another misguided attempt to limit rising sales prices, housing sales are\ntaxed at 6%. With supply/demand unaddressed, this only serves to reduce\nhousing mobility. Instead of downsizing to a smaller apartment once the kids\nleave home, freeing up the home for a young family, these taxes encourage\npeople to stay on, only to eventually hand the property down to their children\nonce they\u2019re too old to raise a family of their own.\n\nFinally, the government levies a \u2018Land Value Increment Tax\u2019, essentially a\ncapital gains tax on property, further discouraging people to sell, reduced\ninvestment in property relative to other investment vehicles untaxed in this\nway (e.g. discouraging badly needed refurbishment of older properties).\nHowever, it does allow the city government to capture some of the heightened\nproperty values caused by their regulatory regime.\n\nThe net effect of these taxes is to create a split society. Those who own\nproperty enjoy a range of special tax privileges (especially if they never\nsell), while the younger and less well-off are squeezed as more of society\u2019s\npaper wealth becomes locked up in housing.\n\n####\n\nOther policy failures\n\nPromises to provide more social housing have been a long-running major policy\nplatform of both national and city government politicians. Unfortunately,\nresults have been limited because, unlike Singapore, the state has no\nmechanism to bypass its own planning laws, so state-led development faces all\nthe same barriers and difficulties as private sector development, in fact\ncompeting for available sites, bids up the price of transfer rights, etc. No\nwinning here without zoning reform.\n\nAcknowledging the issue with maintenance, the government recently passed the\n\u2018Statute for Expediting Reconstruction of Urban Unsafe and Old Buildings\u2019\nwhere buildings \u2018not reaching minimum structural safety standards\u2019 receive a\nbonus 10% FAR to incentivise reconstruction, declining to 1% by 2028.\n\nReturning to our earlier example, here\u2019s how the enhanced FAR works in\npractice:\n\nIf this is the policy response for even cases of structurally unsafe\nbuildings, the country is still fundamentally unserious about the scale of the\nproblem.\n\nHere are my proposals for fixing this mess:\n\n####\n\n1) Large-scale upzoning and elimination of building/floor area ratios\n\nDemand-side thinking and policy has created a disaster for young Taiwanese,\nand consequently, for the nation. If young people cannot afford housing,\nthey\u2019re far less likely to start businesses and families. Taiwan is aging\nrapidly. The generation born today is already 1/3 the size of those 40-50.\nFertility is among the world\u2019s lowest. A nation without children has no\nfuture.\n\nUpzoning works. After Auckland\u2019s widespread upzoning in 2016, the number of\nbuilding completions rose over 50% to record levels. Affordability is\nimproving rapidly. Rents, previously unrelenting, have since stagnated -\nfalling relative to incomes and inflation.\n\nHouse prices are high because people want them and are willing to pay for\nthem. A programme of zoning deregulation would unlock this latent value. It\nwould spurn a construction boom (placing upward pressure on stagnant wages),\nallowing the city\u2019s crumbling buildings to be replaced with modern apartments\nof higher quality, and in much greater quantity, finally allowing supply to\ncatch up to demand.\n\n####\n\n2) Eliminate the housing tax, and tax breaks for surface parking, and other\ninefficient uses of land.\n\nThe taxes on housing are well intentioned, but counterproductive to the goal\nof getting more houses built. Let the market determine the best use of land.\nRight now, high prices are the only signal required for people to make money\nby providing more housing, if the government would only allow it.\n\nMany people are in larger houses they no longer need. Nostalgia and personal\nconnection will keep many of them where they are, but the government should\nnot be putting up tax barriers in the way of people downsizing and opening up\nthose dwellings to families that need the space.\n\nTaipei is space-constrained. A tax regime that favours surface carparking\ncomes at the cost of something else more useful that could be on that land\ninstead. Remove the tax breaks for carparking. If motorists want more parking,\nthen they can pay its true cost rather than being subsidised by everyone else.\n\n####\n\n3) Address density concerns separately through \u2018development contributions\u2019\n\nTaiwan gets very poor results from relying on B/FAR incentives to address\ndensity and provide amenity. Instead, the city government should be empowered\nto capture a proportion of the large increase in capital values enabled by\nderegulation, and use this funding to improve public services.\n\nAs you can see, such a framework would allow many more houses to be built,\nwhile providing a much needed injection of capital into local governments,\nallowing investment in modern facilities, footpaths, water pipes, sewers, and\nother required infrastructure.\n\n####\n\n4) Build a movement\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen in New Zealand, this means a decade or more of sustained effort\nbefore generating enough momentum to translate into policy changes. It\ninvolves supporting grass-roots organisations of pro-housing young people,\nacademic research, and think-tank policy development.\n\nThe idea is to create a movement for political change supported across each\nlevel of analysis. Politicians need to see this as a vote winner, and that\nrequires a broad base of people who see the (normally abstract) issue of\nzoning reform to be in their interest. Students need to be talking about these\nissues at university and on social media. Activists and economists need to be\non the radio/talk shows laying out the moral and economic case for reform.\nWhen politicians start to become interested in the idea, the movement needs to\nbe prepared with detailed proposals laying out how it all works in practice,\nincluding anticipating objections and providing politically viable solutions.\n\nSuccess would require building and sustaining a broad coalition for change,\nbut the seeds could be planted by a lean organisation of a dozen or so\ndedicated individuals. You\u2019d need: a charismatic media-savvy leader type;\npolicy specialists in planning, law, and urban economics; creatives able to\nmake a splash on social media; networking types able to reach out and convert\nkey groups like politicians, students, and existing housing pressure groups\ninto the movement; and several talented administrators able to smooth the way,\ndistribute and monitor funding, bring international speakers to key events,\netc.\n\nEven with funding for scholarships and community organisation grants, this\ncould still be delivered relatively cheaply: something like $1.2m USD/year\nsalaries, and as much again to cover overheads and other expenses. So\nsomething like $22m USD over 10 years, far outside the budget of the young\npeople who most need this to be done, but well within the means of a small\ngroup of patriotic Taiwanese-American business people or software developers.\n\nOne way or another, Taiwan's housing crisis will resolve itself. Currently\neach generation is half the size of the one before. Taiwan\u2019s population has\nplateaued and is beginning to fall. In the absence of change, demand (i.e. the\nnumber of people wanting houses) will continue to fall to meet static supply,\nleaving another generation locked out, and with dramatic implications for\nTaiwan's future.\n\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far, you should subscribe to the blog by entering your\nemail below. Thanks for reading.\n\n1\n\nEstimates of Taiwanese housing affordability vary considerably. The \u2018median\nsale price\u2019 method (often quoted in media articles) is an easy way to look\nacross cities in North America or Australia, where the median dwelling is a\nbroadly comparable house in the suburbs. However, it tends to obscure more\nthan it reveals when applied to Taipei, where dwellings have fewer and smaller\nrooms and minimal additional land area.\n\nUsing \u2018price per square metre\u2019 allows a more direct comparison. Taipei\napartments within walking distance of central metro stations are approx\n$13000USD/sqm, higher in absolute terms than Vancouver, and not far behind New\nYork. Consider though that the median Taiwanese salary in 2023 was ~$22000USD.\nLevelised affordability in these terms produces figures as high as 28x annual\nmedian income.\n\n2\n\nNationalist leader Chiang Kai-Shek, though undoubtedly flawed in many ways,\ndeserves some credit for his willingness to put aside ideology and honestly\nreflect on his failures.\n\n3\n\nIncreased land supply and reduction in land rents created surpluses for\nfarmers previously working barely above subsistence. These surpluses, along\nwith generous loans, enabled farmers to invest in their newly-owned farms in\nthe form of modern machinery, new techniques and seed-stock, etc. Agricultural\nproduction doubled in the decade following these reforms and continued to rise\nthroughout the remainder of the century as the green revolution took hold.\n\n4\n\nNon-residential sites have been relatively plentiful due to greater relative\nsupply and the 'mixed-use by default' zoning that makes lower stories\nthroughout the cities available for commercial use such as restaurants, small\noffices, retail outlets. In addition, the government has been delivering a\nseries of \u2018Ease of Doing Business Reforms\u2019 since 2008, aimed at reducing\nbarriers to entry for small businesses such as waving fees, tax-writeoffs for\nstartups, and implementing an online \u2018one-stop shop\u2019 for everything from\npermits and registration to infrastructure connections. These enablers of\nsmall-business contribute greatly to the vibrancy of Taiwanese cities, and\nshould be widely adopted abroad.\n\nWhile small commercial businesses continue to thrive, large industrial\ncompanies have lately begun to struggle as industrial land capacity begins to\nrun short. Even TSMC, Taiwan's highest prestige and most politically well-\nconnected company has struggled to navigate the redevelopment process required\nto build new chip fabs in recent years, driving their expansion overseas to\nJapan in particular.\n\n5\n\nPopulation density estimates vary due to administrative boundaries, and\nwhether nearby Taoyuan and Keelung are considered part of \u2018Taipei\u2019. While\nthese cities do share strong economic ties, and many Taiwanese do commute from\nthese areas, for the purposes of this discussion, I\u2019m considering the\ncontinuous urban area of \u2018Taipei City\u2019 and \u2018New Taipei City\u2019, home to roughly\n6.6 million people across some 300-400sqkm of urban area (the majority of the\nadministrative area, like Taiwan in general, is highly mountainous).\n\n6\n\nActually, this example would likely end up as six story building (if allowed\nunder height limits), after lift lobbies, shafts, and other \u2018shared\u2019 spaces\nthat don\u2019t contribute to the FAR are added. The fact that these spaces can be\nprovided \u2018for free\u2019 incentivises absurd outcomes in such a space-constrained\ncity, such as how otherwise modest apartment buildings in Taipei will\ntypically have grand lobbies covering the entire ground floor. On the whole,\nthese \u2018requirements\u2019 simply make new housing more expensive, and reduce\ndevelopment capacity for minimal public benefit.\n\n7\n\nMany of the floors in these buildings will have been split into multiple\nsmaller dwellings, making the acquisition that much more difficult. However,\nthe price/floor area is similar, so for the sake of simplicity, let\u2019s imagine\nthat these are all 3-bedroom dwellings.\n\n8\n\nThe FAR incentive cap is legislated in the Urban Renewal Act, article 65. The\nact allows for up to a 200% bonus in the case of \u2018strategic renewal areas\u2019\nwhich can be specially designated by the local authority in areas close to a\nrailway station or airport, which also provide land value/housing tax\nreduction for a period of up to two years. I\u2019m told this happens extremely\nrarely in practice.\n\n9\n\nPrivate school tax exemption provided in Section 3, Chapter 2, \u2018Land Tax\nReduction and Exemption Regulations\u2019, of the Land Tax Act. Note that cram\nschools also receive other tax benefits, such as generous government health\ninsurance subsidies 350% higher than those received by any other private\nenterprise.\n\nTangentially, I\u2019m routinely told that standards are very poor in these\ninstitutions. Long hours, Tests are typically given every two days, with the\nremainder of the time spent teaching to the next test, with little educational\nbenefit. Unfortunately, Taiwanese society is highly structured around these\nschools, such that opting out leads to lower expectations for the child by\ntheir school teachers, segregation into lower quality schools/lower streams\nwithin those schools, and difficulty in adjusting to such an intensive\nenvironment upon reentry. It\u2019s not that the system is entirely without\nbenefit, but it\u2019s a product of the hyper-competitive years during the\npopulation boom of the late 20th Century (many people competing for relatively\nfew stable well-being jobs), and ill-suited to the reality of a working-age\npopulation now projected to halve within a generation with too few people to\nfill required roles.\n\n### Subscribe to Public Service\n\nBy Alethios \u00b7 Launched a year ago\n\nTalking about public policy, operational excellence, and frameworks of\nunderstanding in the age of AI.\n\n12 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n1 Restack\n\n12\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Taiwan's Housing Crisis\n\nalethios.substack.com\n\n2\n\nShare\n\n2 Comments\n\nJ.K.
