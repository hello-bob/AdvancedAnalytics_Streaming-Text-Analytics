Required reasons for each listed API\n>   2. Privacy manifests\n>   3. Valid signatures when the SDK is added as a binary dependency\n>\n\nAntoine van der Lee:\n\n> While Apple provides rich documentation, it\u2019s hard to understand what you\n> must do. Therefore, I decided to simplify the process and added a frequently\n> asked questions section to help you.\n\nDonny Wals:\n\n> In this post, I\u2019d like to show you how you can add a privacy manifest file\n> to your app so that you can resolve rejections related to ITMS-91053.\n>\n> [...]\n>\n> Adding a privacy manifest file is a new requirement from Apple that, in my\n> opinion, could have been handled better. Manually working on plist files is\n> a tedious job and the keys and values aren\u2019t that easy to manage.\n\nPrivacy Manifest Generator:\n\n> Since editing the file by hand is somewhat tedious, this site will help you\n> generate the file instead so you just select which items you need to include\n> and we do the rest!\n\nJesse Squires (Mastodon):\n\n> But then... you see that the list contains UI libraries that haven\u2019t seen\n> significant updates or any activity for multiple years, like SVProgressHUD.\n> Why does a library that provides a single UI component need a privacy\n> manifest? Is it as concerning and as potentially privacy invasive as the\n> Facebook SDK? Some of the UI-only SDKs on the list haven\u2019t seen significant\n> updates (or any updates at all) within the last 4-5 years. Furthermore, even\n> AFNetworking hasn\u2019t had an update in 4 years because it was deprecated long\n> ago after being supplanted by Alamofire. The AFNetworking repo on GitHub has\n> been archived and read-only for over a year! Who\u2019s going to bother adding a\n> privacy manifest to that?\n>\n> [...]\n>\n> And then... you know what\u2019s even more bizarre about this list? There are no\n> links! There are no links to the SDK project homepages or GitHub repos. It\n> is a plain text list of names, and in some cases, seemingly random names\n> like \u201cfile_picker\u201d. Ok LOL. SDK and library names are not necessarily\n> unique. How are you supposed to know exactly which SDKs they are referencing\n> with so little information? Searching for \u201cfile_picker\u201d or\n> \u201cimage_picker_ios\u201d or any of the other obscure names on both CocoaPods and\n> the Swift Package Index returns no results!\n>\n> [...]\n>\n> As many readers have pointed out, there are also a number of popular SDKs\n> that really should be on this list if Apple is concerned about privacy. For\n> example, the TikTok SDK, GoogleAds, and the Unity Ads SDK are all missing\n> from the list, just to name a few. How strange!\n>\n> [...]\n>\n> When Apple imposes new privacy regulations in such a slipshod manner, how\n> are we, as developers and as users, supposed to take this seriously? This\n> feels like more bureaucratic security and privacy theater.\n\nNick Heer:\n\n> I assumed this list would be dominated by SDKs for analytics,\n> authentication, logging, advertising, and other potentially sensitive use\n> cases. [...] This list of SDKs contains seemingly few such packages. As of\n> writing, there are 87 SDKs on Apple\u2019s list and fully one-quarter of them \u2014\n> by my count \u2014 are Flutter packages intended to simplify cross-platform\n> development.\n>\n> [...]\n>\n> As Squires writes, any documentation about why these SDKs are on Apple\u2019s\n> list would be helpful.\n\nTalal Haj Bakry and Tommy Mysk:\n\n> In practice, we analyzed the network traffic of several popular apps that\n> were updated after May 1, when this new requirement took effect. We focused\n> on the API that retrieves a device\u2019s boot time, or system uptime. It is the\n> elapsed time in seconds since a device was restarted. Combined with a few\n> other signals, the system uptime leads to generating a very accurate\n> fingerprint of a device.\n>\n> [...]\n>\n> All the approved reasons emphasize that information retrieved by the APIs\n> may not be sent off-device.\n>\n> [...]\n>\n> Our testing shows that Facebook still sends the system uptime off-device.\n\nSo do Google Chrome, Instagram, Spotify, and Threads. Like privacy nutrition\nlabels, privacy manifests seem to be privacy theater.\n\nPreviously:\n\n  * Swift\u2019s Native Clocks Are Very Inefficient\n  * Embedding a Privacy Manifest Into an XCFramework\n  * Privacy Manifests Update\n  * Privacy Manifests\n  * Misleading and Inaccurate iOS Privacy Labels\n\nFacebook Google Chrome Instagram iOS iOS 17 iOS App Open-source Software\nPrivacy Privacy Manifests Programming Spotify Threads\n\n## Comments RSS \u00b7 Twitter \u00b7 Mastodon\n\n### Leave a Comment\n\n\u2190 \u2192\n\nBlog Archives Tag Cloud Top Posts\n\nRecently Updated RSS Feed \u00b7 Comments Mastodon \u00b7 Twitter Apple News\n\nSupport this site via Patreon.\n\nTry my Mac apps:\n\nDropDMG EagleFiler SpamSieve ToothFairy\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2000\u20132024 Michael Tsai.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
