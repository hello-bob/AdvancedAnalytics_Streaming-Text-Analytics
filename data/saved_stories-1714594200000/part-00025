Buyers do not\nexpect new cars to improve or change once they are rolled out of the dealer\u2019s\npremises. Only occasional maintenance, software updates or repairs are carried\nout to keep the vehicle functional. To stay competitive, car makers introduce\nnew models to market every four to seven years and these models are refreshed\nwith minor functional and cosmetic changes around halfway through their life\ncycle.\n\nBut the status quo is being challenged by the Californian car company Tesla.\nMuch like your smartphone, Tesla releases frequent software updates to improve\nand change the functionality of the cars they design and manufacture, thereby\nmodifying cars continuously after the point of sale. To better understand\nTesla\u2019s digital innovation practices, we looked into how and how often Tesla\nupdated their best-selling Model S and consider the potential implications of\ncontinuous development to product and marketing strategies.\n\nThe frequency and characteristics of change\n\nWe collected data from various online sources over 1344 days between June 2012\nand February 2016. During this period, Tesla made five major software\nreleases, complemented by 23 minor and 89 maintenance updates, amounting to\n117 releases. The distribution of the total number of releases (117) across\nthe period (1344 days) shows that Tesla released a new version of software for\nthe Model S, on average, every 11.5 days.\n\nWe also examined the changes in features and functionalities and classified\nthem into seven categories. These range from information management, such as\nmaps and communication, to entertainment, including radio and Spotify\nstreaming, to user interface design and self-steering.\n\nA number of qualitative aspects captured our attention. While updates were\ngenerally aimed to improve and enhance functionality, bugs were also\nintroduced. Some technical issues were also reported, such as flashing\nscreens, the need for rebooting and occasional unexpected shutdowns. A few\ntimes functionality was changed or removed as a response to safety risks or\nregulatory intervention. For example, Tesla raised ride-height (ground\nclearance) when battery fires were under investigation in 2013; then, later in\n2015, Hong Kong\u2019s Transport Department told Tesla to temporarily disable the\nAutosteer and Auto Lane Change functionality.\n\nThere is a further advantage to Tesla\u2019s model: as functionalities can be\nchanged and activated by updating software, the company is able to sell\nadditional features throughout the car\u2019s lifetime.\n\nImplications for product and marketing practices\n\nOur findings show that a product, traditionally considered to be finished and\ncomplete, can become open-ended and continuously \u201cin the making\u201d if a company\ndecides to adopt the modifiable character of digitally controlled components\nand functionality. This brings upon novel avenues and challenges for\ninnovation and product management practices.\n\nNotably, companies have a wider spectrum of choice in their product and\nmarketing decisions. To lower upfront costs, a firm may decide to enter the\nmarket with a product that is good enough to get early traction, then develop,\nimprove and maintain it until the end of the product\u2019s lifecycle. Marketing\nmessages could be tailored to emphasise the promise of continuous innovation\nand improvement instead of focusing on the finished goods.\n\nThis also offers more choice to the consumer. They may decide to purchase a\nproduct where the specification is fully known at the point of purchase, or,\nalternatively, to buy into a stream of updates, which not only enables new\nfeatures and improves existing functionality but requires them to maintain and\nlearn new features and settings.\n\nWhile opening up choice, the idea of incompleteness and continuous improvement\nblurs the boundaries of control between product owners and manufacturers.\nAfter purchase, it has traditionally been the owner who decides how the\nproduct he or she owns changes. With the more iterative approach this aspect\nmay no longer be valid. Since the manufacturer can alter a product, it also\nretains a significant portion of control over specifications and\nfunctionalities.\n\nThis might not be much of a problem as long the software updates are seen as\nimprovements. However, occasionally, the verdict on whether a particular\nsoftware update is considered an improvement may be open to debate. If\nsoftware release cycles are short, the question as to how many updates an\naverage user is willing to accept is another important question. Constant\nchange may place users in a continuous learning mode, which can affect the\noverall satisfaction with a product. What works for early adopters may not be\nsuitable for a more conservative clientele.\n\nWhile computers and smart phones have long benefitted from continuous\ndevelopment, this open-endedness and modifiability is currently transforming a\nlarger range of products. In order to bring customer needs and organisational\ncapabilities together, product managers, marketing managers and strategists\nshould plan for the modifiability of a product throughout its life cycle; by\nreflecting upon the hardware and software configurations, software development\ntimelines and practices and cloud-based infrastructures that are required to\nsupport modifiability, as well as the legal and contractual arrangements. On\nthe academic front, more research is needed to study the managerial and\nstrategic implications brought upon by continuous product modification and the\nlongevity and shift of control in customer relations.\n\nNotes:\n\n  * This blog post is based on the authors\u2019 paper The Ambivalent Characteristics of Connected, Digitised Products: Case Tesla Model S.\n  * This article is an edited version of the original, published on the LSE Business Review in 2017.
