He\nhas over a decade of experience covering the tech industry.\n\nApr 18, 2024, 3:03 AM UTC\n\n## Share this story\n\nIllustration: The Verge\n\nGoogle fired 28 employees in connection with sit-in protests at two of its\noffices this week, according to an internal memo obtained by The Verge. The\nfirings come after 9 employees were suspended and then arrested in New York\nand California on Tuesday.\n\nThe fired employees were involved in protesting Google\u2019s involvement in\nProject Nimbus, a $1.2 billion Israeli government cloud contract that also\nincludes Amazon. Some of them occupied the office of Google Cloud CEO Thomas\nKurian until they were forcibly removed by law enforcement. Last month, Google\nfired another employee for protesting the contract during a company\npresentation in Israel.\n\nIn a memo sent to all employees on Wednesday, Chris Rackow, Google\u2019s head of\nglobal security, said that \u201cbehavior like this has no place in our workplace\nand we will not tolerate it.\u201d You can read the full memo at the bottom of this\nstory.\n\nHe also warned that the company would take more action if needed: \u201cThe\noverwhelming majority of our employees do the right thing. If you\u2019re one of\nthe few who are tempted to think we\u2019re going to overlook conduct that violates\nour policies, think again. The company takes this extremely seriously, and we\nwill continue to apply our longstanding policies to take action against\ndisruptive behavior \u2014 up to and including termination.\u201d\n\nIn a response statement, the \u201cNo Tech for Apartheid\u201d group behind the protests\ncalled Google\u2019s firings a \u201cflagrant act of retaliation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the three years that we have been organizing against Project Nimbus, we\nhave yet to hear from a single executive about our concerns,\u201d the group wrote\nin a post on Medium. \u201cGoogle workers have the right to peacefully protest\nabout terms and conditions of our labor. These firings were clearly\nretaliatory.\u201d\n\nYou can read Rackow\u2019s full memo below:\n\n> Serious consequences for disruptive behavior\n>\n> Googlers,\n>\n> You may have seen reports of protests at some of our offices yesterday.\n> Unfortunately, a number of employees brought the event into our buildings in\n> New York and Sunnyvale. They took over office spaces, defaced our property,\n> and physically impeded the work of other Googlers. Their behavior was\n> unacceptable, extremely disruptive, and made coworkers feel threatened. We\n> placed employees involved under investigation and cut their access to our\n> systems. Those who refused to leave were arrested by law enforcement and\n> removed from our offices.\n>\n> Following investigation, today we terminated the employment of twenty-eight\n> employees found to be involved. We will continue to investigate and take\n> action as needed.\n>\n> Behavior like this has no place in our workplace and we will not tolerate\n> it. It clearly violates multiple policies that all employees must adhere to\n> \u2014 including our Code of Conduct and Policy on Harassment, Discrimination,\n> Retaliation, Standards of Conduct, and Workplace Concerns.\n>\n> We are a place of business and every Googler is expected to read our\n> policies and apply them to how they conduct themselves and communicate in\n> our workplace. The overwhelming majority of our employees do the right\n> thing. If you\u2019re one of the few who are tempted to think we\u2019re going to\n> overlook conduct that violates our policies, think again. The company takes\n> this extremely seriously, and we will continue to apply our longstanding\n> policies to take action against disruptive behavior \u2014 up to and including\n> termination.\n>\n> You should expect to hear more from leaders about standards of behavior and\n> discourse in the workplace.\n\nFeatured Videos From The Verge\n\nMost Popular\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1. ## The invisible seafaring industry that keeps the internet afloat\n\n  2. ## NASA confirms origin of space junk that crashed through Florida home\n\n  3. ## The free Delta game emulator for iPhones is live on Apple\u2019s App Store\n\n  4. ## Nine Google employees arrested after eight-hour sit-in protest\n\n  5. ## Sony might have perfected Mini LED TVs with its new 2024 lineup\n\nFrom our sponsor\n\nAdvertiser Content From\n\n## More from Google\n\n  * ### The Pixel 7A is a knockout at its record-low $349\n\n  * ### Nine Google employees arrested after eight-hour sit-in protest\n\n  * ### Google Maps will use AI to help you find out-of-the-way EV chargers\n\n  * ### Motorola is bringing the wooden phone back with its new Edge series\n\n  * Advertiser Content From\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n  * How We Rate and Review Products\n\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Jobs @ Vox Media\n\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
