It\nwas the first big social-media IPO since Snap went public in 2017. Reddit\nclosed out its first day on the market up almost 50%, but has since come\ncrashing back down to earth at 30%. Despite the drop, Reddit is beginning to\nrethink how it functions now as a public company.\n\nLast summer, Reddit locked down API access, much to the chagrin of long-time\nusers, who protested against the change, which killed their favorite third-\nparty apps. In February, it secured a licensing deal with Google for training\nAI models. And last month it launched Reddit Pro, a new analytics and insights\ntool for advertisers. So Reddit is open for business and exploring ways to\nbecome more than just the internet\u2019s front page.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the business of the site that\u2019s changing. We\u2019ve discovered\nthat the nature of what goes viral on the platform has also shifted\ndramatically in just the past few months \u2014 in seemingly good ways. The most\npopular posts on Reddit have switched from reposted content from \u201ckarma\nfarmers,\u201d or engagement hackers, to nearly entirely original content from less\npopular Reddit users. Original content from smaller communities is now\noutperforming recycled evergreen content by a tremendous margin across the\nplatform. As of October, none of the top five posts of the month on r/all were\noriginal. By March of this year, four out of five of these posts were\noriginal.\n\nWe\u2019ve discovered that the nature of what goes viral on the platform has also\nshifted dramatically in just the past few months \u2014 in seemingly good ways.\n\nMore so than other social networks like Facebook, the core Reddit experience\nis defined by its user-generated content. And now that Reddit Inc. is a\npublicly traded company, that content has to reliably and consistently be\nnative to the platform. Has Reddit made an effort to remove content that\noriginated elsewhere from its most visible and popular posts?\n\nReddit told us no. A spokesperson for the site said the changes we observed\nwere happening organically, possibly because of a new post index system\nthey\u2019re testing out, which keeps feeds like r/all updated with fresher\ncontent. The increased number of upvotes, however, tell a different story. But\nto understand what\u2019s changed and how, we first have to dig into how Reddit has\nfunctioned for the majority of its pre-IPO life.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe best way to think about Reddit is as a nesting doll of smaller and smaller\ncommunities, or subreddits. You might follow a couple of them for a hobby \u2014\nr/crochet has 1.1M members \u2014 or your favorite TV show \u2014 r/SVU has 62,000 \u2014 and\nnever see the larger platform. These different communities can set their own\nrules, appoint moderators, and avoid dealing with everyone on the site as a\nsingle mass. Reddit\u2019s IPO put a huge spotlight on how important these members,\nwho are unpaid, are for maintaining the site \u2014 the company gave long-time\nusers stock.\n\nThe content within subreddits is organized by a score redditors call \u201ckarma.\u201d\nAnd in theory a post\u2019s karma is the number of upvotes it receives minus the\nnumber of downvotes it receives within a certain amount of time. But in\npractice, attempts to artificially inflate karma are popular enough \u2014 both\nfrom people wanting attention on their posts and spammers who want to use the\nposts for marketing \u2014 that Reddit uses a variety of ways to control and\nobscure the numbers. A 2016 Verge article mentions the last publicly announced\nchange to the karma system before the website closed its open-source\nrepositories in 2017.\n\nReddit\u2019s front page, r/all, is a list of posts with the most upvotes, or\nbiggest karma, across every subreddit all at once. Which makes r/all a\ncontentious feature among Reddit\u2019s users, since a post from a smaller\ncommunity reaching the top can attract a flood of new, uninformed voices to\nthe subreddit. But r/all is also effectively the most important real estate on\nthe site. Years ago, a link getting to the top of r/all would be referred to\nas the \u201chug of death,\u201d because it would bring so much traffic to your website\nthat it could crash.\n\nUsers have thoroughly figured out how to game this system over the years,\nthough, and up until recently, r/all was almost entirely populated by big,\nestablished subreddits like r/MadeMeSmile or r/facepalm. And usually the posts\ncoming from these subreddits are low-hanging videos or screenshots taken from\nother platforms weeks or even years after they were originally created. The\nterm for this kind of engagement hack is \u201ckarma farming,\u201d or worse, \u201ckarma\nwhoring.\u201d But that seems to be changing.\n\nHas Reddit made an effort to remove content that originated elsewhere from its\nmost visible and popular posts?\n\nWe\u2019ve tracked r/all\u2019s most popular monthly posts since early 2023, and our\ndata suggests that in recent months some kind of change was made to combat\nkarma farmers monopolizing the most-viewed spots on the page.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor the entire second half of 2023, we saw just four posts that made it to the\ntop that weren\u2019t reposted from a different social platform (we didn\u2019t count\n\u201cmeta\u201d posts about the website). Almost 90% of these posts came from accounts\nthat regularly repost content.\n\nBut since this January, only 27% of the top monthly posts on r/all have been\nfrom karma-farming accounts. In their place, we\u2019re not only seeing more\noriginal posts, but ones from smaller accounts that don\u2019t regularly reach that\nechelon of popularity.\n\nReddit, however, denies they are doing anything to make this happen. When we\nreached out to Reddit, they initially told us that the account we were using\nto collect our data may have been part of a test that had been running for\nseveral years, which shows certain users feeds with fresher content. We don\u2019t\ncollect data through one single account, but instead track r/all while logged\nout of the site and have also accessed Reddit from different Wi-Fi networks\nover the past year and haven\u2019t seen any inconsistencies with karma totals or\nvisible posts on r/all. Still, Reddit\u2019s spokesperson said we may be part of\nthe test group, even when logged out.\n\nThe representative also would not say how many users are affected by this\ntest, only that it doesn\u2019t impact how karma works. At least, strictly\nspeaking. The spokesperson did admit, however, that it\u2019s possible this test\ncould generally affect what hits the top of r/all.\n\n\u201cContent is loading faster so it alters what people see and when, and\ntherefore what gets ranked higher because they're seeing more and newer\ncontent faster,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nReddit has released next to no information about how its karma system has\nchanged since it stopped being open-source in 2017.\n\nAs for why these changes are so noticeable now, there may be something else\nhappening that, when combined with the effects of this content test index,\nwould result in the drastic shift in what\u2019s hitting r/all. In February, rumors\nstarted circulating among users that the admins for r/all were removing\nreposts directly from the feed, since they\u2019re more likely to come from\nspammers or have inauthentic engagement numbers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve announced a number of mod tool improvements, so this is likely a result\nof better auto modding,\u201d the representative said. \u201cBut it also doesn\u2019t look\nlike it would impact ranking.\u201d\n\nHowever accurate they are, the numbers are all we have to go on. Reddit has\nreleased next to no information about how its karma system has changed since\nit stopped being open-source in 2017. And its more recent moderation decisions\nhave mostly focused on reacting to large user movements, such as in July, when\nit locked out moderators who were keeping subreddits inactive in protest of\nits API changes.\n\nWhatever the culprit is, it\u2019s fairly clear why a site like Reddit would be\nhappy that karma-farming reposts are less present on its homepage now.\nOriginal user content is so important for Reddit that the company\u2019s S-1\nadvertised the IPO with several posts, comments, and images from the website.\n\nIronically enough, though, it provided no credit or attribution to those users\nfor their contributions.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGarbage Day is an award-winning newsletter that focuses on web culture and\ntechnology, covering a mix of memes, trends, and internet drama.
