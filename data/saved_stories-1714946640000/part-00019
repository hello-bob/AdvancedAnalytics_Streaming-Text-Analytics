The\nresearchers hope to commence sale of the medicine in 2030.\n\nCongenital tooth deficiency is believed to affect about 1% of the population.\nThe absence of six or more teeth, a condition known as oligodontia, is\nbelieved to be hereditary, and is said to affect about 0.1% of the population.\n\nA tooth that grew in a mouse with a congenital tooth deficiency, is seen\ngrowing after it was given the medicine, in this photo provided by Kitano\nHospital.\n\nAccording to Kitano Hospital in Osaka's Kita Ward, which is involved in the\nstudy, the first phase of the clinical trials will run from September this\nyear to August 2025. The medicine will be administered intravenously to\nhealthy individuals to confirm its effectiveness, with 30 males between the\nages of 30 and 64 taking part. The subjects must be missing at least one back\ntooth so that there will be no problem if the medicine takes effect and a\ntooth begins to grow. No major side effects have been confirmed in animal\nstudies to date.\n\nIn the next stage, the medication will be administered at Kitano Hospital to\npatients with congenital tooth deficiency. Researchers plan to limit the\nsubjects during this phase to those between the ages of 2 to 7 who have at\nleast four teeth missing from birth.\n\nThe tooth regrowth medicine deactivates a protein called USAG-1, which\ninhibits the growth of teeth. The team believes that in the future it may be\npossible to grow teeth not only in people with congenital conditions, but also\nin those who have lost teeth due to cavities or injuries.\n\nThis photo provided by Kitano Hospital shows the front teeth of a ferret that\nwas given the medicine. It had six teeth at first, but a seventh one, pictured\nat center, grew in.\n\nLead researcher Katsu Takahashi, head of the dentistry and oral surgery\ndepartment at Kitano Hospital, commented, \"We want to do something to help\nthose who are suffering from tooth loss or absence. While there has been no\ntreatment to date providing a permanent cure, we feel that people's\nexpectations for tooth growth are high.\"\n\n(Japanese original by Yosuke Tsuyuki, Osaka Science & Environment News\nDepartment)\n\n  * Font Size\n\n    * S\n    * M\n    * L\n  * Print\n  *     * Timeline\n    * 0\n\n  * Go to The Mainichi Home Page\n\n## Related Articles\n\n  * World's 1st 'tooth regrowth' medicine moves toward clinical trials in Japan\n  * No toothbrush available?
