I worked for a broke little magazine so stressful the\nproduction manager threw her phone at the floor and screamed \u201cFuck\u201d every\nafternoon at three, clockwork. About to turn thirty, I was beginning to hate\nmy life.\n\nIn need of silence, I booked a room at a Trappist monastery. The following\nFriday, I snuck out of work early and headed south, not realizing that Ava,\nMissouri, was four hours away, down at the border of Arkansas. I sped down the\ninterstate, glided off the exit ramp\u2014and got stuck behind a livestock trailer.\nFor the next hour, as we crept along a narrow country road, the wide face of a\nbrown and white cow gazed back at me. Its fuzzy ears stuck straight out, like\nthey had been glued on at the last minute. Lashes curled above steady brown\neyes that held a lifetime\u2019s observations.\n\nSlowly, a calm stole over me. By the time the road widened, I had no desire to\ngo around. The placid look on that cow\u2019s face\u2014wordless, accepting\u2014had righted\nmy universe.\n\nThere was no way to pass that trailer. I know because I kept trying, agitated,\nfor the first three miles. The cow watched. Where it was heading, how idyllic\nor ominous its destination, I had no idea; nor did the cow know. Sighing, I\ndownshifted, resigning myself to lost time. The cow held my gaze. The future\nfell away.\n\nSlowly, a calm stole over me. By the time the road widened, I had no desire to\ngo around. The placid look on that cow\u2019s face\u2014wordless, accepting\u2014had righted\nmy universe.\n\n(Shutterstock)\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nI reached the monastery more than ready to obey its Rule of Silence. The cow\nhad prepared me. No TV, phones, or email? Sweet relief. Only the schedule gave\nme pause: rising at four in the morning for vigils, then returning to the\nchapel at the first sliver of dawn for lauds? Sleep-deprived by deadlines and\nunnerved by a tense breakup with Nine Inch Nails, I was already planning an\nalarm malfunction when Father Ted showed me to my room.\n\n\u201cNo need to set an alarm,\u201d he called over his shoulder. \u201cThe bell will wake\nyou!\u201d\n\nAnd so it did, brass crashing against brass time after time, unrelenting. I\nfinger-combed my hair, threw a sweater over my T-shirt, and pulled on sweats\nthat presented no challenge to celibacy. In the dark, stone-chilled chapel, I\nslid into the last pew and watched a young monk light candles one by one until\nthe whole space glowed. The older monks entered and, on invisible cue, began\nto sing the day\u2019s psalm in perfect unison. Each note was pure; none jostled,\ncompeting to be heard. The voices did not have to strain against\naccompaniment; they were the music, a tone poem flowing without punctuation\u2019s\njagged hesitations. Just a smooth rise and fall of deep, resonant voices,\nordering the cosmos.\n\nLater I would learn that Gregorian chant is based on the cadence of human\nbreath. At the time, all I knew was that no other sound came this close to\nsilence. The words felt like a prayer that could go on forever, old monks\ndropping dead and new ones slipping into their place, only God to hear their\nsong. In its peace, space and time stood still.\n\nThe silence outside the chapel was just the opposite: alive and tingling,\ntuned to something deep inside me. I had expected an absence, a mortification,\nnot this electric energy. It felt charged, like those seconds at the end of a\nmagnificent symphony just before the audience jumps to its feet in a\nthunderclap of applause.\n\nI did not yet know, on that trip, how many different kinds of silence there\nare, and how they can heal or harm us.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nThe blind double date two years later was a married friend\u2019s idea. We were all\nstruggling through grad school, and when she described the guy she had in mind\nfor our other single friend, there was no denying he was perfect. Both loved\nVictorian homes and anything British; both were conservative and staid and\nproper. Andrew and I were the wild card, nothing like them and, as far as I\ncould tell, nothing like each other, either. But for the other couple\u2019s sake,\nI showed up, overcaffeinated and a little nervous, thus even ditzier than\nusual. Chattering about trivia, I banged my head on the pendant chandelier as\nI sat down. He took it all in calmly.\n\nThe words felt like a prayer that could go on forever, old monks dropping dead\nand new ones slipping into their place, only God to hear their song. In its\npeace, space and time stood still.\n\nAfter lunch, we all went to the zoo\u2014except that I could not walk any real\ndistance, had what I would twenty years later learn was a congenital hip\nproblem. I sank down on a low wall and told the others to go on without me; I\nwould wait there.\n\nAndrew settled himself next to me.\n\n\u201cNo, no, you go on!\u201d I urged. \u201cSee the zebras, for heaven\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, this is fine. I\u2019ll wait with you.\u201d (Later, he would admit that he thought\nI was just hating the date, but since he was not sure, staying seemed more\ncourteous.)\n\nWe chatted a bit, mainly about how cute, how obviously perfect for each other,\nthe other two were. Then we fell silent, the spring sun warm on our shoulders,\nthe only sounds the occasional giggling child or happy roar from the seals.\nThough clearly intelligent, he made no effort to dazzle me with words. Neither\nof us felt a need to pour chitchat into the breach.\n\nThe comfort startled me.\n\nStill, a historian? How boring. He read, okay, but not the sort of books I\nloved. And what did I really know about him, anyway? He could be an ax\nmurderer, a sociopath, a spy....\n\nThe minutes passed, and one by one, my reservations dropped away. That easy\nsilence felt like all I needed to know.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nIt was good to wed, to hear and feel another presence in my home. Though I\npride myself on my capacity for solitude and often hunger for it, if I am left\nalone too long I grow restless, turn on music, watch TV, call friends, talk to\nthe dog. Become, in short, one of those fools I scorn: the people who cannot\nabide silence.\n\nThe household I grew up in was noisy with religion, my grandmother and great-\naunts murmuring prayers for lost keys, temperamental furnaces, and a crashing\nend to any relationship they disapproved of. My-uncle-the-Jesuit (in our\ndevout family, he was inseparable from his vocation) said Mass in the living\nroom, in sonorous Latin. By dinnertime, holy curses rang out from the kitchen.\n\u201cJaysus, Mary and Joseph!\u201d exclaimed my grandmother and great-aunts, appalled\nby one another\u2019s deficiencies. Dessert was a round of gossip, most of it mean-\nspirited.\n\nBut oh, we were Catholic. Whenever tornado sirens wailed, we carried blessed\ncandles down into the basement, and Grandpa cranked up his little black\ntransistor radio, the weather updates echoing off damp concrete. At every\ncommercial break, my imperious grandmother shushed him so she could summon\nSaint Medard, patron saint of bad storms.\n\nThe minutes passed, and one by one, my reservations dropped away. That easy\nsilence felt like all I needed to know.\n\nThese days, I own no blessed candles. Nothing is blessed anymore\u2014or rather,\neverything is. Let the storms come. We might go to the basement\u2014we did, once,\nmy husband carrying our huge scared dog in his arms, and Buddy pushing with\ngiant paws against two walls at right angles at the top of the stairs to avoid\nthe descent, then scrabbling for purchase until he dislodged the waistband of\nAndrew\u2019s sweatpants and Andrew had to stagger down those narrow open stairs\nwith his pants around his knees and seventy pounds of panicked poodle in his\narms. From the foot of the stairs, I watched, helpless to help. I had no\nspecial prayer to recite; I had stopped imploring God and the saints for\nfavors, tricks, and ease. In this new silence, all I could do was laugh\u2014and\nmaybe that was a form of blessing, too. Because I knew he would somehow get\nthe dog downstairs, and we would somehow all survive the storm. Or we would\nnot. And while my grandmother would have called that God\u2019s plan, I just call\nit the energy of a fast-changing universe, steadied only by love.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n\u201cDo you see them?\u201d the old farmer asked. I squinted, then gasped as the white\ncross-hatch came into focus. An entire field littered with cow\nskeletons\u2014skulls and long bones and stripey rib cages scattered atop clover\nand quackgrass and dandelion tufts. A cow cemetery? \u201cYou can take one if you\nwant,\u201d he said, and it felt like the best possible present. Was this\ndesecration? Would their ancestors curse me? I took the chance, picking up a\nskull and running a possessive finger over its ridges and curves. Bleached by\nyears of sunlight, it carried an old, clean peace.\n\nPillowing the skull in my car\u2019s back seat, I thought of the cow who had\nsoothed my impatience years earlier. If I ever lose my mind, I regularly\nreminded my husband, put me where there are cows. Left to their own devices,\nthese calm creatures will keep vigil over their new dead, and I imagined them\ngathering in their cemetery. Every other animal takes the customs of its\nspecies seriously; only we humans have lost our rites. Our days are ordered by\nbeeps and clicks and Netflix, none of it restorative.\n\nI need, I crave, I\u2019m obsessed with, I\u2019ve gotta have\u2014that secular jangle was\nwhat had driven me to the Trappists years earlier. Bad boyfriends and a\nhyperkinetic job were only surface irritants; I could see that now. I had\nturned up the world\u2019s volume so loud, I could no longer hear my heart. Though\nI had no wish to return to the Catholic church, I wanted to be part of its\nrich silence again.\n\nEvery other animal takes the customs of its species seriously; only we humans\nhave lost our rites. Our days are ordered by beeps and clicks and Netflix,\nnone of it restorative.\n\nAnd now, for oddly similar reasons, I wanted this skull. Coveted it. Carried\nit the many miles home and presented it with a flourish and saw my husband\u2019s\nface pale. A skull? In our garden? I nodded happily, and there stayed what was\nleft of Elsie, or Bessie, or whatever her real, cow name was, until the bone\ncracked apart, crumbled into the petunias, and lent them, too, its\ncontentment.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nMy mother-in-law was recovering from her second stroke. By a fluke (and what\ntragedy does not seem a fluke?) it had struck the exact same spot as the first\nbut on the opposite side of the brain. This new stroke had zapped Jo\u2019s ability\nto speak, though her mind was as fresh and sharp as ever.\n\nFive years earlier, when my mom\u2019s lungs had collapsed with Legionnaire\u2019s\ndisease, she was placed in a coma. A twilight state, they called it, such a\nlovely phrase for purgatory. The illness had struck so fast, there was still a\nmessage from her on my phone. I pressed play and heard her voice, light and\nreassuring, telling me she was fine and not to worry, probably just\nbronchitis. Sickened by the contrast, I pressed save with a shaky finger.\n\nYears later, when my father-in-law was dying, I sat by his bed with a tape\nrecorder, tugging for his happiest memories, wanting to save his voice. After\nhe died, Andrew could not bear to listen to the tape and hear his dad\u2019s ghost,\npresent without being there.\n\nNow, home after a day at the hospital with his mother, my husband sits down\nhard, as though someone just cut the strings that held him. \u201cI have just\nrealized,\u201d he begins, so little breath to it that I have to bend close to hear\nhim. He pauses, draws in more air. \u201cI have just realized that I will never\nhear my mother\u2019s voice again.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nVoices carry. They bring you warmth, amusement, exasperation, reassurance.\nNever would I want to silence someone I loved. But when AI reconstructs our\ndead, pulling their favorite words from a database, finding their precise\ninflections, I cringe. The sound of someone\u2019s voice is what we yearn for,\nalmost more than their touch, but a disembodied voice can only be a delusion.\n\nAnd what of a body without a voice? In the year after her stroke, I sat with\nJo while she did the speech therapist\u2019s drills. When her frustration mounted,\nwe tried singing the exercises, which sailed her past the blockage. \u201cHappy\nBirthday to you,\u201d she sang on my birthday, unprompted. The words came out\nalmost whole, and she punched the air with her fist.\n\nJo\u2019s emotions intensified\u2014or seemed to, with no words to dilute them. Her\nexasperations were unmistakable, and when she was happy, her smile was a kid\u2019s\nopen grin, turning her eyes an even brighter blue. Her hands danced in the\nair, eager to express her thoughts. With painfully limited options, she had\nfound a simple eloquence.\n\nBut every gain would vanish the next day, as though someone had lifted the\nplastic sheet on one of those old Magic Slate writing pads and cleared all the\nwords. Finally we gave up and bought her spiral notebooks. At least she could\npour out her feelings, I thought, knowing this was how I would cope. But Jo\u2019s\nthoughts sometimes flitted away before she could get them down, and her\nwriting faltered, slanted off the page, grew fainter and smaller with every\nstroke. We tried a text-to-speech computer, but her typing mistakes made it\nspeak an embarrassing gibberish. She waved it away and settled for printing\nstripped-down sentences in all caps.\n\nThen the change began.\n\nJo\u2019s emotions intensified\u2014or seemed to, with no words to dilute them. Her\nexasperations were unmistakable, and when she was happy, her smile was a kid\u2019s\nopen grin, turning her eyes an even brighter blue. Her hands danced in the\nair, eager to express her thoughts. With painfully limited options, she had\nfound a simple eloquence.\n\nNow I looked forward to our conversations. Meaning and emotion flew back and\nforth easily, free of doublespeak and the need to decode. She had shown me how\nrare that was, and what a grace.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nA Friday night, rain slanting hard against the blackened window. We chose a\nsilly-scary show about a monastery with a strict rule of silence\u2014only theirs\nwas not a turning inward to reach God. These monks kept silent because a\nsingle spoken word would release a demon from a locked chest.\n\nUnable to speak, the investigators scribbled notes to each other, and the long\nstretches of quiet made the episode, demon aside, almost relaxing. Then it\nended, and Andrew flipped to the news, flooding the room with hollow words.\nCelebs divulging their vices, scandals, and pain; influencers hawking brands;\npoliticians congratulating themselves; competitors one-upping their rivals.\nAll of us, releasing demons daily.\n\nSilence can be protective. Or, it can aid evil. Silence like a cancer grows,\nwhenever power refuses to hear truth. Silence is an unblown whistle, a\ndisappeared activist, a dismembered journalist. Silence slides down one\ngeneration to the next, keeping pain a secret. Silence is what neighbors\nremember about the shooter.\n\n\u201cSay their names!\u201d protesters yell every time another unarmed Black person is\nkilled by police. Yet we choose \u201ca moment of silence\u201d\u2014that brief, ludicrously\ninadequate compromise of creeds\u2014for our public commemorations. Silence is\ncomplicated. In \u201cA Film in Which I Play Everyone,\u201d Mary Jo Bang writes, \u201cIn\nscene two, silence is a sleeve, I\u2019m an arm in it.\u201d Does she mean that silence\nprotects her? Clothes her and keeps her warm? Hides her, covers her up?\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw called silence \u201cthe most perfect expression of scorn.\u201d\n\nWhat we leave unsaid weighs far more than what we say. My mother used to pout,\nthough she would never have used the word; she saw her passive sulk as a\ndignified refusal to fight. Or maybe she was biting back words she would\nregret later? Talk can be dangerous, setting or springing a trap. Once I lost\na friend who must have silently objected to some belief or behavior of mine.\nInstead of saying so, she simply retreated, ghosting me before that was even a\nthing. And though it hurt, I have done the same to others, neatly avoiding any\nexplanation. My mother\u2019s daughter, I thought cowardice superior to conflict.\nYet the silent treatment is crueller than most words, and will chill a body to\nthe bone.\n\nHush money, non-disclosure contracts, secrecy oaths, and death threats\u2014people\nhave tried to silence each other for millennia. Yet silence reveals rather far\nmore than it erases. Awkward pauses tell us more than the sentences that\nfollow. Hesitations are dead giveaways, whether you are asking for the truth\nor a favor. Omissions can turn language into poetry\u2014or mark its failures.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw called silence \u201cthe most perfect expression of scorn.\u201d\n\u201cLove me, hate me, but don\u2019t be indifferent to me,\u201d my grandmother used to\nmutter to my retreating grandfather\u2019s back. Silence is the ultimate\ncancellation.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nSome sounds terrify us. We hurry to hush a loved one\u2019s sobs, as though dry\neyes will make their misery disappear. Bailiffs move even faster to demand,\n\u201cSilence in the courtroom!\u201d Bereaved, we are silenced forever, enjoined not to\n\u201cspeak ill of the dead\u201d\u2014just when it could finally be harmless and cathartic.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all sunshine and lollipops,\u201d a recently widowed friend remarked\ndryly. But once someone beloved is gone, people want only sweetness coating\ntheir memory. A custom designed to protect the rest of us when our turn comes.\n\nSilence, though, can also terrify. We crave response, feedback, reassurance.\nDelivering tragic news, the police routinely ask, \u201cIs there someone who can\ncome stay with you?\u201d They know we cannot yet bear silence; cannot be alone and\nlost. When my mother was dying, t\u2019ai chi calmed me, but in the days after her\ndeath, I could not practice. Scared to feel any more, my body refused the\nstillness.\n\nIn this country, we pathologize the quiet, goading them into loud conformity.\nGrade-school report cards called me \u201creserved,\u201d meaning I had best muster some\nsocial skills asap. Even in adulthood, struck shy at a party, I know that if I\ndo not throw myself into the fray, I will be thought either haughty and aloof\n(if I carry myself erect) or pathetic (if I hunch into myself and hide on the\ndarkened periphery). Silence has been framed as society\u2019s enemy. It broods,\nholds hostage, cannot be trusted. Worst of all, it spells boredom. We are\naccustomed to entertaining ourselves by filling all the empty space with\nnoisemakers and firecrackers.\n\nYet nothing is more boring than a lot of noise.\n\n(Shutterstock)\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nAnyone can play John Cage\u2019s three-movement composition 4\u201933.\u201d You need only\nsit at the piano for thirty-three seconds, open and shut the lid, sit another\nhundred-sixty seconds, open and shut the lid, sit for eighty seconds, then bow\nand leave the stage.\n\nCage wanted the audience to listen to all the other sounds that surrounded\nthis choreographed silence. \u201cTry as we may to make a silence,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\ncannot.\u201d\n\nSo why seek the impossible? All the glorious music, conversation, and\nmachinespeak swirling around us in a sound cloud reminds us that we are still\nin the game, not exiled to some green room with no audio feed. Sound is\nexciting\u2014it changes the world. But it has to stop now and then. Without\n\nspaces in between, you cannot parse the words. Without stretches of silence,\nyou cannot hear yourself or anyone else.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nStitching quilts by hand, artist Joe Cunningham works long hours in complete\nsilence. \u201cIt makes me feel wealthy,\u201d he says, and I know right away what he\nmeans: that sense of abundance. Talk, after all, is cheap. In silence, time\nstretches out, languorous as a cat. Silence is not transactional; it is as\ndeliberately useless as the Hanukkah candles. Because it cannot be measured,\nit suggests (though this is not always true) that you have enough time. It\nrefuses to fret.\n\nAs a reporter, I know how to shut up until the quiet grows so uncomfortable\nthat the truth bubbles up. But the minute I close my notebook, the skill\ndissolves. At meetings, I babble, driving my colleagues crazy with my\nenthusiasms. To make sure a friend knows I am not judging, I stick in too many\nassurances that I get it, understand completely, of course. If Andrew comes\nhome with a problem, I rush to help and can almost see him pull back,\nexhausted, because now he has to bat away advice he did not want and explain\nwhy my solution might not work, and really all he wants is dinner.\n\nShy as a child, I waited six decades to form opinions, and now I am perhaps\ntoo eager to voice them. I also add anecdotes\u2014I have stored up quite a\nfew\u2014plus anything I have read on the topic.\n\nCraving knowledge, I too often equate it with wisdom. Yet as far as I can\ntell, every wisdom tradition since time began has praised silence. The\nstillness they urge is a letting-go, a slowing down, an unclenching of our\nhands and our stubborn, intractable desires. It empties us, yet is far from\nempty.\n\nWhen sound waves rush into our ear canal like high tide, the whoosh vibrating\nour eardrum, we call this percussion \u201cnoise.\u201d Silence makes no waves, so we\nhave defined it only as an absence of noise. Silence, though, is always\npresent. Noise is simply what obscures it.\n\nUntil this year, scientists assumed\u2014we all assumed, without even bothering to\nattach words to common sense\u2014that our brains react to the \u201cabsence\u201d of silence\nas a lack, an in-between time devoid of interest. But in fact, our brain\nreacts to silence as though it were a song, a roar, a bang. In test after\ntest, people fall for silence illusions (guessing a stretch of silence to be\nlonger if it was continuous than if it was broken, for example) the same way\nthey fall for auditory illusions. They are processing silence, just as they\nprocess noise. \u201cI\u2019ve begun to realize that you can listen to silence and learn\nfrom it,\u201d a character in one of Chaim Potok\u2019s novels remarks. \u201cIt has a\nquality and a dimension all its own.\u201d\n\nSilence, the brain insists, has substance.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nNo wonder the monks pick four in the morning; it is the quietest time. Even\nour bodies drop their defenses, the immune system taking a quick break. Unable\nto sleep, I sit on our porch in the dark, letting the silence envelop me. If\nasked, I would describe it as soft, thick, and balmy, but I would be confusing\nit with the night air. Even after reading that study, I still cannot manage to\ndefine silence except by what is missing: voices, car engines, barks,\nbirdsong, the scrape and whir of a neighbor\u2019s chainsaw.\n\n\u201cThe ability to relate to absence is a defining feature of all psychological\ncreatures,\u201d says Nico Orlandi, a philosopher of mind. \u201cHumans, for example,\nare distinctive in their ability to relate to things that are not immediately\npresent to them.\u201d\n\nFerns soften the crevices of a rock wall, eating light and drinking rainfall.\nBirds call to one another from the hill prairies and soar across limestone\nglades. Rainwater pools around chinquapin oaks and shagbark trees. Celandine\npoppies dot the grass, but they will be gone in a week; spring is fragile. The\nbluffs are not. Theirs is a quiet like nothing in civilized society.\n\nIf I met Orlandi at a party, I would toss back a glass of champagne then tell\nhim I have no idea what \u201cthe ability to relate to absence\u201d even means. It\nsounds (note that omnipresent verb) like the capacity for loneliness, but is\nthat distinctively human? Other animals grieve, miss those who are not there,\ngrow ill when isolated. The ability to use absence, though\u2014now that could be a\nhuman trick. We can listen to silence and hear our thoughts rise. We can sense\nour brain untangling, cooling, renewing itself. And we can allow silence to\ndeepen our compassion\u2014which is another way of saying our humanity.\n\nSilences that close us off, refusing connection, shoring up the ego at others\u2019\nexpense\u2014those are dead silences. But the letting-go sort, the silences that\nhold space or keep vigil for someone else? They are alive.\n\n(Shutterstock)\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nThe sight of that brown sign welcoming me to the Illinois Ozarks drops my\nblood pressure, and as the trees start to outnumber the houses, something\ntight and sad inside me unwinds. I take the back way: it winds up and down the\naisles of a cemetery and then onto a road that looks like it is going nowhere,\nwhich is where I want to be. My right hip is now made of shiny white titanium,\nand I climb hills and scramble over rough terrain like an Alpine goat. Andrew,\nwho spent so many nights massaging away the pain and forgiving me that first-\ndate recalcitrance, understands my eagerness to hike, just as I understand\nthat he would rather avoid ticks and poison ivy and prep his class lectures.\n\nAt the trailhead, I let the dog romp a bit. He dives into a pile of leaves and\nbops the stiff switchgrass with his nose. When I take out his lead and hold it\nup\u2014no need for words\u2014he trots back and lets me fasten us together. Then we are\noff, climbing over storm-struck trees and veering off the trail to explore\nmossy boulders that rolled down the bluff a century ago. Ferns soften the\ncrevices of a rock wall, eating light and drinking rainfall. Birds call to one\nanother from the hill prairies and soar across limestone glades. Rainwater\npools around chinquapin oaks and shagbark trees. Celandine poppies dot the\ngrass, but they will be gone in a week; spring is fragile. The bluffs are not.\nTheirs is a quiet like nothing in civilized society. A deep quiet, not silent\nat all, layered beneath rustlings and chirpings and tiny scampering feet, the\nslither of flathead and rat snakes and plains scorpions.\n\nMost days, life\u2019s demands come at me like flung Frisbees, but here, they\ncannot reach me. Here, I feel at home in a way I do not even feel at home,\nbecause here, all I need do is be. This is the silence I craved all along: not\nan absence of noise but a freedom from my tiny, petty self. As I move through\nthe trees, I am listening, but not hard-focused for connotation or tone. In\nnature, I eavesdrop on what I once thought of as silence and realize it is\nonly the gentle noise of a world going on without me.
