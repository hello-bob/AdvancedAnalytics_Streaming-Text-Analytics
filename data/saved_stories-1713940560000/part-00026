You need to work on it and\nfinally you think \u201cwell yeah that is a lot\u201d.\n\nThe video above beeps only on Google, and it shows how the official Dutch\ngovernment jobs site (which also advertises for the intelligence and security\nservices) sends your every click to Google - despite never asking for your\npermission to do so. It also reports to Google if you clicked the button\n\u201capply for this job\u201d, or even \u201ccall us for information\u201d. Nice.\n\nI announced the tool in a tweet:\n\nAnd within a week, the video received a million views. This spurred me on to\nadd support for Facebook and dozens of the other trackers that infest our\nsites. Behold the noise when you visit some well known news sites:\n\n## Media appearances\n\n  * RTLNieuws.nl\n  * 9to5Google\n  * it-daily.net\n  * Stadt Bremerhaven\n  * Tarnkappe.info\n\n## Status of the software\n\nFor now, it is still pretty rough stuff, suitable only for Linux, OSX and BSD\nusers comfortable entering command lines. The goals are:\n\n  1. Continue development on Linux until the necessary features are implemented and stable\n  2. Perhaps simultaneously make an Apple / OSX version available that runs with a single click\n  3. Create a Windows version\n  4. Perhaps perhaps try to implement something similar on iOS and Android, which will not be easy: phones prefer to snitch on you in full privacy\n\n## Live demo installation\n\nI would also love to turn this into a live demo for use on phones and tablets.\nThe idea would then be to have a low power WiFi network. There\u2019s a big QR code\n(on a poster or a big screen). If you scan that, your phone asks you if you\nwant to join the demo WiFi.\n\nAnd when you do and use your phone, big speakers make the tracker noises. For\nextra points, make one speaker per tracker, so a huge Google speaker, one for\nFacebook and dozens of smaller ones.\n\nEspecially Android phones leak information 24/7 so this should be a pretty\nconvincing demo.\n\nIf anyone wants to help make this happen, let me know. All it requires is a\nRaspberry Pi and another phone to deliver internet connectivity.\n\n## Further Goals\n\n  * Support all popular trackers\n  * Configurable which ones you want to hear about\n  * With configurable sounds (also in stereo, so \u201cgoogle\u201d in the middle, \u201cFacebook\u201d on the right speaker)\n\nTags: privacy\n\n\u00a9 2014-2024 bert hubert\n\n", "frontpage": false}
