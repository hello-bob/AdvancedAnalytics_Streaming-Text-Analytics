Here\u2019s What You Need\nto Know\n\nThe Affordable Connectivity Program\u2014a federal benefit that provides discounts\non high-speed internet access to low-income Americans\u2014ends on April 30. Here's\nwhat happens next.\n\nIllustration: tampatra/Getty Images\n\nToday marks the end of the Affordable Connectivity Program, a landmark piece\nof US government legislation that aimed to make it easier for people to afford\nan internet connection in their homes. The program\u2019s end marks a big shift,\nwith the cessation of benefits set to affect millions of Americans who might\nneed them most.\n\n## What Is the Affordable Connectivity Program?\n\nIn 2021, the US Congress passed the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment\nand Jobs Act, also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal. It was a\nmassive, ambitious piece of legislation that aimed to shore up a variety of\nfloundering industries, including transit networks, energy systems, and public\nutilities. The ACP was part of that deal. It set aside $14.2 billion to fund\ncredits that could help low-income households afford high-speed internet. If a\nfamily\u2019s household income was below 200 percent of the Federal Poverty\nGuideline per year, they were eligible for a $30 monthly credit on their\nbroadband bill. People living on Tribal lands were eligible to receive up to\n$75.\n\nToday, all that is going away.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly not an ideal situation, considering that access to the internet\nis a necessity in modern society, especially in the post-Covid era, when\nremote work has been normalized. Not being able to get online can contribute\nto a widening digital divide, where people without internet access can fall\nbehind socially and economically. Americans who have come to depend on the\ndiscount will see their internet bills spike and will potentially be forced to\nbalance the increased cost with paying for food, rent, and other essential\nneeds. Not to mention that many ACP beneficiaries had come to rely on getting\ntheir internet for free; initial urging by the White House led to many\ninternet providers offering plans with minimum download speeds of 100 Mbps for\n$30 a month. Customers who were applying their ACP benefit to these plans were\ngetting internet access for free. Starting tomorrow, they will have to start\npaying for it.\n\n## Why Is the ACP Expiring?\n\nThe problem is funding. Like with any federal funding, there\u2019s a limit to how\nlong a program can go on without being renewed by Congress. The Biden\nadministration has made several pleas to lawmakers to save the program,\nincluding one last October requesting a $6 billion investment to continue the\nprogram, among other domestic spending. Despite that and a number of pleas\nfrom advocacy groups and organizations like the Federal Communications\nCommission, nothing came of these attempts, and the program has officially\nlapsed.\n\n## Who\u2019s Affected?\n\nAccording to the White House, more than 23 million households have taken\nadvantage of the program since it went into effect. That\u2019s a staggering\nnumber\u2014roughly one in six households\u2014who now have to find another way to\nscrape together the funds to stay connected.\n\nFeatured Video\n\nThe end of the ACP is not exactly a surprise for the organizations that\nsupport it. In anticipation of the future lack of funding, the ACP stopped\naccepting applications for the program in February 2024. According to the US\nFederal Communications Commission, networks are required to alert users that\nthe program has come to an end, so affected households should have received\nnotices about the wind-down.\n\n## What Happens Next?\n\nUnfortunately, any of the families who have been getting the ACP benefit will\nhave to start paying full price for their internet connections\u2014provided\nthey\u2019re able to afford it. If a household\u2019s income is below 200 percent of the\nfederal poverty line, or if the household claims other government benefits\nlike SNAP, Medicaid, or Social Security, there\u2019s a way to get a similar\nreduction in internet cost, albeit a much smaller one. The Universal Service\nAdministrative Company offers a service called Lifeline, which can pay up to\n$9.25 per month for a connection (and up to $34.25 per month for anyone living\non qualifying Tribal lands).\n\nIn a press conference yesterday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-\nPierre reiterated the Biden administration\u2019s stance of pushing big telecom\ncompanies to continue honoring the ACP rules despite the lack of funding,\nsaying, \u201cWe announced earlier this month that we are encouraging providers to\ntake steps to keep their consumers connected at this crucial time by over low-\ncost, no-cost plans.\u201d However, it isn\u2019t clear whether any of the providers\nwill be keen to play along.\n\nIf you\u2019re affected, your internet provider should have already sent you two\nnotifications about your service. If that\u2019s not the case, you should contact\nyour provider. Ultimately, affected users will have to decide whether to\ncontinue their service at the new price. The FCC has an information page about\nthe ACP wind-down, where it also encourages filing complaints.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Gear\n\nI Tried These AI-Based Productivity Tools.
