Among them Unmaking the Public University (2011) by\nChristopher Newfield, Fall of the Faculty (2011) by Benjamin Ginsberg,\nNeoliberalism's War on Higher Education (2019) by Henry Giroux and of course\nJohn Taylor Gatto's Dumbing Us Down (2002). Together, I think these give an\naccurate account, at least as far as I've seen things as a professor these\npast 30 years.\n\nWhat I now see as a cybersecurity practitioner, is that Western society has\nscored a spectacular own goal through a profound miscalculation. We're running\nout of capable people who can operate, protect and maintain the technical\ninfrastructure we're now entirely dependent upon. It is not a problem that can\nbe solved by immigration or global remote labour. It isn't a problem that \"AI\"\ncan solve. This puts us in a precarious defence position.\n\nAn assault on education, designed to curb it's democratising influence, began\narguably with Powell's famous 1971 memorandum decrying the \"Attack on American\nFree Enterprise System\", and an influential 1975 paper on The Crisis of\nDemocracy by The Trilateral Commission. These right-wing ideas were a reaction\nto the culture of the 1960s, to civil rights, anti-war, feminism, and free\nspeech which increasingly criticised capitalism and its effect on the\nenvironment. Ironically the attack harmed not only the arts, but technical\nskills too. Though this creed started in the United States it spread into\nBritish culture from the late 1980s, but less so into Europe. Indeed the\nprominent systems and quality theorist W. E. Deming called it the \"American\ndisease\", criticising what today we'd broadly term 'cost-cutting efficiency'\nas the cause of plummeting quality.\n\nAnother result was a project to privatise the public schools and universities.\nIt aimed to kill intellectual life, so business could defend its interests\nagainst \"liberal media and leftists\". That project is very much alive today\nunder the guise of conservative calls to 'protect the children' by banning\nbooks and organised political assaults on higher education.\n\nCapital has always required that people be no more educated than is necessary\nto operate its factories, thus education's goal of personal enrichment has\nbeen entirely replaced by dreary, dead-end corporate values. The new order\neschews open sharing, mobility, plurality of views and deep knowledge. Broad\neducation is reduced to job training, limited to narrow technical expertise.\n\nThis poor quality substitute for real education does not activate our\nknowledge seeking and self-development capacities. Theorists refer to it as\nthe banking model of education. Under this model students are simply passive\nrecipients of flat information, which they 'bank' as if it were money. They\nneed not think as such, since all questions of process and purpose are\nreplaced by economic logic of a new professional management class (the MBAs).\nThis way, business owners could maintain authority over production without\nideological challenge.\n\nPerhaps the most devastating impact of this credo has been on culture. It has\ndestroyed people's self-respect. When you no longer see yourself as a human\nbeing, with potential, valuable in your own right, but instead as an 'asset'\nto exploit in the job market, it is a path to madness. It is no different from\nthe fate of the individual under Communism except that one serves the economy\ninstead of the party. Much of our current teen mental health crisis,\nespecially amongst students, is rooted in this loss of \"lived life\" and its\nreplacement by Marxist reification, also known as \"using yourself\".\n\nHistorical wars have shown that such reified persons are no use in a defence\nforce except as cannon fodder. They will care little for their own lives, but\nblindly follow orders and march into machine-gun fire. However, they cannot\nsurvive a single day on their wit, since they have no drive to. They are are\nnot good soldiers.\n\nSimilarly crippled, students have been restricted to studying subjects able to\nearn high-paying jobs necessary to repay huge debts. STEM was idolised and\nhumanities demonised, leading to a dangerous imbalance. Up went the shutters\non English and History departments. Out went the professors of Politics and\nGeography. The gates were chained, and a huge \"Closed Forever\" sign went up at\nthe Psychoanalysis centre. If you couldn't measure it, write it down as an\neconomic formula and compete for grant money, then it went into the shredder.\nIf it didn't have \"industry demand\" and add \"shareholder value\", it was for\nthe chop.\n\nIf \"industry demanded it\" but it didn't smell right then a subject could be\nbeaten into a STEM shape. Nursing, a carey-sharey calling, became vocational\nhealthcare with proper targets, and so on.\n\nDo not mistake this as separation into useful and useless subjects. Middlesex\nUniversity and University of West London in the UK famously ran bachelors\ndegrees in Homeopathy, a quack subject which was able to \"attract students\"\nand therefore make a profit in the new education market.\n\nAt this point little more needs saying. In 2024 The university has been\ndevastated. It's a triumph of form over function, of appearance over reality.\nClueless deans and chancellors make apologetic speeches to docile acolytes\nabout the low quality, unaffordable experience we still pretend is\n\"education\". We sell little slices of British approval to overseas students\nfor about \u00a3100,000 a go. Students openly cheat, entitled to the certificates\nthey paid for. Tens of thousands of academic staff have quit, leaving barren\ninstitutions to deliver mechanical, cookie-cutter courses provided as\ncorporate packages for remote study.\n\nThe student union bar is boarded-up, a relic of sociability. Students hide in\ntheir claustrophobic accommodation, like battery hens munching anti-\ndepressants. Libraries are empty and papers locked up online by greedy\npublishers. It's a ghost town. A run-down, out of season seaside resort with a\ndisused, rusted roller-coaster and spooky, dilapidated amusement arcades.\n\nWhen not in therapy sessions with mental health counsellors, students play the\nslot machine of the certificate mills, putting a coin in the AI essay writing\nmachine, and hoping Turnitin and other dehumanising proctoring software is\nlooking the other way as they give it a desperate kick. Higher education is\nofficially a wasteland, and we can expect most of the smaller universities to\ngo to the wall in the next couple of years.\n\nCollapse of the sector will please those who have hoped to see an end to\nhigher education for the masses. But the fault lies squarely with the\nuniversities themselves, where decades of corruption, mismanagement and\nselling-out to publishers, BigTech, trendy think-tanks and donor money has led\nthem to their own demise..\n\nWell done \"industry\"! Happy now \"business\"?\n\nWell here's why you shouldn't be... That was everything sustaining you.\n\n### What we've lost\n\nLike a cartoon lumberjack sitting on the wrong side of the branch, industry\nhas been sawing away it's own future. Sustainability and resilience are very\ncomplex matters. Like a thousand ton oil tanker, society won't turn on a\nsixpence. Planning is measured in generations. Modern politics has forgotten\nthat. It operates on \"news cycle\" horizons of a few weeks at most. That fits\nperfectly with suicidal, reckless capitalism.\n\nThe error is this: So business could grow strong, society has been made to\ngrow weak. But business does not protect society. Society protects business.\nBusiness only exists because liberal democratic society gives it protection\nand the nurturing conditions to do so. Industry is subservient to the social\ncontract and rule of Law. Insofar as it undermines the society that grants it\nthose conditions it is suicidal.\n\nCollapse and crisis are rarely things we see coming. We need to be already in\ncrisis before there's some symptoms to act on. By the time an animal feels the\neffects of malnutrition it's already too weak to hunt. Like climate change,\nwe're probably well into irreversible downward spirals now in computer\nresilience and security. Things are going to get much worse for quite a while.\n\nIncidents like the British \"Horizon\" Post-Office scandal, Solarwinds, and\nCambridge Analytica will become weekly and then daily occurrences,\nfundamentally sapping public confidence in all digital technologies. Perhaps\nthat is necessary as most of what we currently build is unfit. After 70 years,\nsoftware engineering is still in its infancy, and we've failed to learn\nanything from decades of letting corporations do what they like.\n\nSecurity problems cannot be solved by rote. Or by legislating. They cannot be\nsolved by pre-packaged systems and \"solutions\". Narrow technical expertise is\nnot enough. Neither will markets fix it. Cool business idea and some Venture\nCapital funding is not enough. A whole spectrum of knowledge must be brought\nto bear on complex problems, over a sustained time period. It requires smart\nand dedicated people who give their whole lives to curate the depth and\nbreadth of knowledge necessary to stay balanced on the shoulders of giants.\n\nBut for a decade we have been paddling the wrong way while a powerful current\ndrags us up the creek. It is the current of nihilistic self-defeat. We've been\ndeliberately weakening the power of the next generation, of those who can\nprotect and maintain systems, because the status-quo fears them. We've been\ndeliberately weakening security so that paranoiacs can have \"visibility\" of\nimaginary enemies plotting against them - and so that manipulators have\n'intelligence' on citizens in order to persuade them to vote 'correctly'.\n\nLook to history and we see such self-immolation is common. Once the cities,\nsteel mills and power stations of the Soviet Union had been built, Stalin had\nall the bourgeois engineers rounded up and shot. For tyrants, there is no\ngreater threat to their system than the people who designed, built and\nunderstand it. The West has had it's own much slower-burning purge.\n\nWe've deliberately dumbed down deep technical knowledge to make everybody\nincluding the engineers into consumers of technology. Through corporate cloud\nservices we've sabotaged the presence of tangible general purpose computing\nand undermined agency and autonomy of owner-operators. Fast profit from\nselling appliances to keep the masses amused became our priority.\n\nTimeless, concrete, empowering knowledge is out. Chameleon frippery, colourful\ncommercial brands and a tide of ephemeral \"apps\", is in. Solid projects of\ndigital literacy to teach children code succumbed to generic classes on\nMicrosoft Office, Excel spreadsheets, and how to run Facebook and YouTube\nmarketing.\n\nEven more serious than the harms done to technical and artistic life is the\nimpact on the relational incurred by ideology. Human qualities we so\ndesperately need now have been mercilessly beaten out of students;\n\nCollaboration and complex team-based project management has been rejected in\nfavour of ambitious individualism. Tolerance, generalism and plurality of\nopinion are seen as \"not picking a side\" in the polarised BigTech stage-drama\nin which comedy Bond villains strut and fret. Scepticism is wilfully mistaken\nfor antagonism. The nuanced \"extreme centrist\" voices we most need to hear are\nlabelled troublemakers and suffocated. Social cooling and learned helplessness\nhave muted justified outrage, making \"useful idiots\" of experts who should\nknow better and show more courage.\n\nCreativity is mocked. Why cling to human subjectivity when we are all nothing\nbut \"large language models\"? Why learn a skill that a machine will soon do\nbetter? Why learn any skill that isn't profitable? Originality is devalued, in\na world where everything has been \"tried already\", patented, copyrighted,\ntrademarked and owned.\n\nCorrectness, doing things the hard way, patience, diligence, delayed\ngratification; these are all considered forms of weakness and failure.\nConvenience and efficiency rule supreme! Balance, empathy, kindness,\ndiplomacy, compassion and care are relegated to faults,\n\nIt is only possible to think this way if one is stripped of humanity. As\nindustrialists and leaders of universities we have been very effective at it.\nBut it also requires the complicity of teachers and students, and in that role\nwe have been willing, enthusiastic enablers of our own dehumanisation.\n\nSadly, an enormous miscalculation is that the humanities really matter*, if\nyou aim for survival in the long-term.\n\n### Why thinking matters\n\nA complex security problem is as likely to be solved by someone who has read\nthe books of Jane Austen as the papers of Alan Turing.\n\nCan you spot a lie, or something anomalous? Would you call it out? Against\nyour \"boss\"? Can you understand the motives of people? Maybe even have a\nlittle sympathy for the Devil? Do you have the patience to wait, maybe for\nmonths or years for a plan to come together?\n\nBeing a great computer security person asks that you understand maths,\nphysics, electronics, code and networks... but did you also know how important\npsychology, social sciences, politics and history are?\n\nThe big problem with a denuded corporate credo designed to churn out cubicle\ndrones is that it stunts intellectual growth. There is no place for classical\nhuman virtues to grow. As Horace Mann knew when creating the first public\nschools, there is no space to create the kind of people who can defend\ndemocracy.\n\nBecause it sells 'education' as just another commodity it avoids teaching\nself-learning. A good computer security person is driven by insatiable\ncuriosity and auto-didactic (self-learning) powers. The world is changing too\nfast for any professor or syllabus to track. Nobody is going to spoon-feed it\nto you. You must learn a modern form of classic excellence and roundedness\n(Arete).\n\nIt also creates timid learners. Once you've left education, it's not over. A\nnew responsibility passes to you to keep up the process and up the pace. That\nrequires not just self-discipline but it requires courage too. Nothing is off-\nlimits. Young people who've been broken by corporate education, trained to be\ncompliant, docile consumers of approved, pre-packaged, safe knowledge stand no\nchance in this game. If the horizons of your career in cybersecurity is\nMicrosoft products, then give up now and take up stamp-collecting.\n\nCybersecurity needs naughty boys and girls. Are you smart enough to get on the\n\"dark web\" and download the hacking papers that were banned at your\nuniversity? Oh, and did you remember to open them in a sandbox, sanitise them\nof malware and fingerprints? Or did you spend your time at university \"obeying\nthe rules\" like a good kid, hoping one day you'll be offered a dream job at\nthe Happy Happy Corp?\n\nSecurity happens because people care, not because systems are theoretically\ninfallible. Security comes from constant vigilance for and against our\nsystems. Reliability and resilience come out of deep understanding, connection\nto others and contemplation of the future. A shallow, insular, reactive\nposture based on \"compliance checklists\" is not going to cut it in reality.\nThat is safety, not security.\n\nThe grave miscalculation of conservatism that goes back to the fears of Powell\nand the Trilateral Commission, is just how much smarter and in control the\npeople need to be in order for us to sustain a technological society. The\ndutiful, responsible and intellectually courageous middle class has been all\nbut eradicated. Dignity of labour and the honest guile of the technical\nworking-class engineer is now long dead. What we are left with is professional\nimpostors and a fragile cybernetic dream increasingly predicated on fake \"AI\"\nand wishful thinking.\n\nThe naive Marxist hope of the old industrialists was that machines would run\nit all. They got it wrong. Machines can make static goods well enough. One day\nthey may even be good enough to fully take over most agriculture, light\nmanufacturing and surgery. But as anyone who pays close attention to the\nlatest news about \"AI\" knows, the cheap, capable, ubiquitous robot overlords\nare not coming. Except as weapons.\n\nThe autonomous cybersecurity sentinels that would \"protect our digital\nborders\" are never going to work. Not because the whole thing is an infantile\nscience-fiction dream, but because we don't have \"borders\" to protect anymore.\nThe world got complex. We need cybersecurity people who are complex too,\noutstanding thinkers, who don't give a damn about the \"shareholders\". Who\ndon't give a damn about \"best practice\", because they can think for themselves\nand see two steps ahead to better practice.\n\n### Error correction\n\nYou don't need to be David Stirling to dare and win. But it is most definitely\ntime for a bit more of that spirit.\n\nWe're losing the battle by following the old rules. We are stuck. We need a\nnew vision and some courage to speak more truth about public cybersecurity,\nlike:\n\n  * Giant monopolies and monocultures are antithetical to good security models. They're just bad for society. Many more smaller businesses are needed.\n  * Progress is a vector not a scalar, it's direction is important.\n  * Technology must be made in the public, not only private interests.\n  * Markets are not good solutions for almost all the hard questions in digital technology.\n  * The direction and purpose of technology is a policy debate as important as health, defence or transport. People must have a say.\n  * Security is never a bare noun. It is always for something, from something and towards some definite end.\n  * The legal assumption that computers \"are correct\" is insane and lethal. That onus needs fully reversing.\n  * Popular cultural assumptions of inevitable technological determinism are very dangerous and require active countering.\n  * Technology as a social control and surveillance mechanism, is fundamentally incompatible with prosperity, innovation and progress.\n  * Governments have a role in civic cybersecurity, which is at the root of national security.\n  * Zero trust is impossible because society depends on trust. A society with no trust is a society that's not worth living in.\n  * Security can never be added later. If it's not secure it must be rebuilt.\n  * and many, many more principles at the root of civic cybersecurity.\n\nWe need a new commission and a new memorandum, one that reverses the\ndevastating mistakes of those 1970s conservative reactionaries. New\ninstitutions and funding for technological progress, education and research\nmust be rebuilt as public projects. We need a plan to re-humanise education,\noust the short-term profiteers and remove industry suck-ups who have hollowed\nout academia like termites. All of these trajectories have left our nations\nvulnerable.\n\nOur \"Crisis of Security\" is that BigTech companies; Microsoft, Google, Amazon,\nApple, Facebook, Cisco, Fujitsu, and now OpenAI... and so on... are the\ncybersecurity threat. We all need and deserve better.\n\nDate: 17 April 2024\n\nAuthor: Dr. Andy Farnell\n\nCreated: 2024-04-18 Thu 09:13\n\nValidate\n\n", "frontpage": false}
