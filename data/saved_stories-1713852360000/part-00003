But one of the many things the COVID-19 pandemic taught us\nis that the structure of the workplace can change significantly and still be\nviable. That realization has opened the door to considering a work week of\nfour 10-hour days or even 32 hours as a real possibility.\n\nThe idea has been around since at least the 1950s; but until recently, it\nhasn\u2019t been taken seriously.\n\nA 2024 KPMG poll of 100 US CEOs found that nearly one-third of US companies\nare exploring the idea of dropping one day a week. That may sound unimpressive\nat first, but think about it for a moment. Let it sink in.\n\nThis is only the vanguard.\n\nFour-day week trials and studies have been surprisingly positive for both\nemployees and employers. The large UK four-day work week pilot program was so\nsuccessful that, of the 61 firms that participated, 92% said they would\ncontinue their four-day work week beyond the trial, including 29% that had\nalready decided to make the change permanent. Earlier studies were also\nsuccessful. And several companies have reported success in many facets of\ntheir business with their own trials, such as US-based Exos.\n\nEmployees are receptive to the idea. A Washington Post-Ipsos conducted a year\nago showed that 75% of US workers would rather work four 10-hour days than\nfive eight-hour days for the same pay. Meanwhile, according to a survey by\ncloud-software vendor Qualtrics, 92% of US workers are in favor of a shortened\nwork week, even if it means working longer hours each day.\n\nEuropean countries may be ahead of the curve on shorter work weeks, with the\nUK and Germany undertaking large-scale trials; Iceland, Portugal, and Spain\nare also running pilot programs; and Belgium is the first country to pass a\nlaw that gives workers the option to work a four-day 40-hour week.\n\n## Analyzing the benefits\n\nA shortened work week can help companies attract top talent, boost employee\nretention, reduce employee stress, lower the carbon footprint of employees\n(and potentially that of the company), and save employees money on commuting\nand childcare. The largest benefit, however, is a major boost to work-life\nbalance, which appears to foster an increase in work productivity. (Check out\nthis list of pros and cons of the 4-day work week.)\n\nThe concurrent arrival of a host of generative AI tools should also bolster\nproductivity, mitigating any risks when switching to a four-day work week.\n\nThose who oppose the notion might see productivity as chiefly measured by time\n\u2014 so many minutes equals so much productivity. And that might be true for\nassembly-line manufacturing, for example; the four-day work week isn\u2019t for\nevery company.\n\nFor many other jobs where what\u2019s being created is intellectual property,\nideas, strategic plans, sales, marketing, and software, for instance,\nintellectual acuity is the essential ingredient \u2014 and burn-out is a very real\nchallenge in such roles. To be sharp, you need to be well-rested in mind and\nbody. A four-day work week could well boost productivity in that kind of\nenvironment.\n\nEven before the pandemic, some companies had begun to loosen up. Casual\nFridays became work-at-home Fridays, for instance. Switching to working four\ndays a week seems like a natural progression in that scenario.\n\nSo, it\u2019s not surprising that a common finding of many four-day-work-week\ntrials is that employee productivity grows, even in 32-hour weeks. More days\nin a week allows for more meetings, more distractions, more long lunches, and\nmore employee procrastination. Fewer days in a week forces employees to\nsharpen their time-management skills and focus on completing tasks. Getting\nyour mind out of the job for three days recharges your batteries and brings\nnew perspective to your work, which in turn can elevate productivity.\n\n## Implementing a four-day work week\n\nTo ensure this change is successful, companies can\u2019t just flip a switch and\nsuddenly tell everyone that they work four days a week. According to the\nHarvard Business Review, four-day work week initiatives \u201conly work if\ncompanies undertake substantial work redesign to reduce hours while\nmaintaining business outcomes. This means streamlining operations, removing\nadministrative burdens, and prioritizing high-impact work.\u201d\n\nFor more information about successfully planning a four-day work week trial or\nroll-out, here are useful resources:\n\n  * How to implement a 4-day work week, according to a CEO \u2014 Fast Company\n\n  * A guide to implementing the 4-day work week \u2013\u2014 Harvard Business Review\n\n  * How to implement a 4-day work week for the whole organization \u2013\u2014 MIT Sloan\n\n  * Four-day week: how workplaces can successfully establish it \u2014 The Conversation\n\n  * The 4-day work week schedule \u2013 An Implementation Guide \u2014 Shiftbase\n\nThe future of work is a complex vista of remote work, hybrid work, return to\noffice mandates, and flexible working arrangements affected by trends like\ngenAI and the pursuit of work-life balance. A shorter work week is a\nsignificant alternative in the mix that could reshape work as we know it. What\nexactly that will look like is hard to predict, but it\u2019s likely the four-day\nwork week will play a leading role.\n\n## Related content\n\n  * opinion\n\n#### The AI talent shortage \u2014 can companies close the skills gap?\n\nFierce competition for genAI talent is driving the need for new thinking about\nemployee-training programs for AI skills.
