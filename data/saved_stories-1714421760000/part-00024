(January 2023)  \n---  \nThe Scandinavian countries\n\nDanish, Norwegian (including both written forms: Bokm\u00e5l, the most common\nstandard form; and Nynorsk) and Swedish are all descended from Old Norse, the\ncommon ancestor of all North Germanic languages spoken today. Thus, they are\nclosely related, and largely mutually intelligible, particularly in their\nstandard varieties. The largest differences are found in pronunciation and\nlanguage-specific vocabulary, which may hinder mutual intelligibility to some\nextent in some dialects. All dialects of Danish, Norwegian and Swedish form a\ndialect continuum within a wider North Germanic dialect continuum.\n\nThis article contains phonetic transcriptions in the International Phonetic\nAlphabet (IPA). For an introductory guide on IPA symbols, see Help:IPA. For\nthe distinction between [ ], / / and \u27e8 \u27e9, see IPA \u00a7 Brackets and transcription\ndelimiters.\n\n## Mutual intelligibility[edit]\n\nGenerally, speakers of the three largest Scandinavian languages (Danish,\nNorwegian and Swedish) can read each other's languages without great\ndifficulty. The primary obstacles to mutual comprehension are differences in\npronunciation. According to a scientific study of the three groups, Norwegians\ngenerally understand the other languages the best, while Swedes understand the\nleast.^[1]\n\nDanish and Norwegian are especially comprehensible to one another.^[2] In\ngeneral, Danish and Norwegian speakers will be able to understand the other's\nlanguage after only a little instruction or exposure.^[3] Traditionally\neducated Norwegians, and especially speakers of Urban East Norwegian,\nunderstand spoken Danish fluently; indeed Urban East Norwegian is closer to\n16th century Danish than contemporary Danish is due to being closely\ninfluenced by the written (Danish) language, which modern spoken Danish has\ndiverged from to a greater degree. However, due to the same reason\ncontemporary Danish speakers generally do not understand spoken Norwegian as\nwell as the extremely similar written norms would lead one to expect. Some\nNorwegians \u2013 especially in northern and western Norway \u2013 may also have\nproblems understanding Danish.\n\nBecause Norway's largest cities have received signals from Sweden's two\nnational TV channels since the 1960s through private antennas, Norwegians\ngenerally have a better grasp of Swedish than vice versa; Sweden did not get\nNorwegian TV until decades later.\n\n## Old Norse and Icelandic[edit]\n\nOld Norse^[4] is a stage of development of North Germanic dialects before\ntheir final divergence into separate Nordic languages. Old Norse was spoken by\ninhabitants of Scandinavia and their overseas settlements and chronologically\ncoincides with the Viking Age, the Christianization of Scandinavia and the\nconsolidation of Scandinavian kingdoms from about the 8th to the 15th\ncenturies.^[5]\n\nThe 12th-century Icelandic Gray Goose Laws state that Swedes, Norwegians,\nIcelanders, and Danes spoke the same language, d\u01ebnsk tunga (\"Danish tongue\";\nspeakers of Old East Norse would have said dansk tunga). Another term was\nnorr\u0153nt m\u00e1l (\"northern speech\"). Today Old Norse has developed into the modern\nNorth Germanic languages Icelandic, Faroese, Norwegian, Danish, Swedish, and\nother North Germanic varieties of which Norwegian, Danish and Swedish retain\nconsiderable mutual intelligibility while Icelandic remains the closest to Old\nNorse.\n\n## History of Norwegian[edit]\n\nMain article: Norwegian language conflict\n\nIn the Kingdom of Denmark\u2013Norway (1536\u20131814), the official language\u2014in the\nsense of written language\u2014was Danish, not Norwegian. However it came to be\nseen as a common language of the kingdoms. The urban Norwegian upper class\nspoke Dano-Norwegian, a form of Danish with Norwegian pronunciation and other\nminor local differences. After the two countries separated, Danish remained\nthe official language of Norway\u2014although it was referred to as Norwegian in\nNorway\u2014and remained largely unchanged until language reforms in the early 20th\ncentury led to the standardization of forms more similar to the Norwegian\nurban and rural vernaculars. Until 1907 the written language in Norway was\nmore or less completely Danish; in the following decades various spelling\nreforms gradually made the language somewhat more different from Danish,\nalthough the differences are still fairly small. Since 1929, this written\nstandard has been known as Bokm\u00e5l. The other Norwegian written standard,\nNynorsk, was constructed on the basis of Norwegian dialects. Attempts to bring\nBokm\u00e5l closer to and eventually merge it with Nynorsk have failed due to\nwidespread resistance during the Norwegian language conflict. As part of this\nresistance, elites, most of the media and significant parts of the population\nsupported an alternative spelling standard promoted by the Riksm\u00e5l movement,\nthat built on the Danish language tradition in Norway. The language struggle\nin Norway also had a class aspect, as the Norwegian educated elites\ntraditionally had a strong affinity for Denmark and its culture, and thus saw\nthe Danish written language as an important part of their identity. Until 1811\nthe University of Copenhagen had been the only university of Denmark-Norway,\nand educated Norwegians thus spent formative years in Denmark. When Norway's\nuniversity was founded in 1811 it built on and maintained close ties to a\nDanish academic tradition, thereby continuing the influence of Danish among\nelites. The most recent reforms of Bokm\u00e5l from 2005 have again brought the\nlanguage closer to the Danish language tradition in Norway by including most\nof the Riksm\u00e5l tradition in official Bokm\u00e5l, thereby largely ending the\nNorwegian language conflict.^[6]\n\n## Sample text[edit]\n\nDanish^1\n\n    I 1877 forlod Brandes K\u00f8benhavn og bosatte sig i Berlin.

However, his political views made Prussia an uncomfortable place to live, and in 1883 he returned to Copenhagen, where he was met by a completely new group of writers and thinkers, who were eager to accept him as their leader. The most important of his later works is his work about William Shakespeare, which was translated to English by William Archer and received recognition immediately.\n\n  1. ^ Excerpts from the articles about Danish critic Georg Brandes from the Danish Wikipedia, version from May 19, 2006, 09:36 and Norwegian (bokm\u00e5l) Wikipedia, version from April 4, 2006, 01:38. The translation of the Bokm\u00e5l sample into Nynorsk and Swedish was created for the purpose of this article.\n\nNote on differences between Danish and Norwegian\n\nNote that Norwegian (moderate Bokm\u00e5l/Riksm\u00e5l) evolved from a language that was\nalmost completely Danish in 1907. Thus Danish spellings only fell into disuse\nover a long period in the 20th century. This means that Danish spellings such\nas \"sig\" instead of \"seg\" would still be very familiar to Norwegians, having\nremained in use by some well into the 20th century and be encountered in many\nof the most important Norwegian literary works from the early 20th century and\nearlier. Many differences between the Danish and Norwegian text above would\namount to stylistic differences in Norwegian; it is possible to use the word\n\"dog\" in the above context in Norwegian, but the word may sound overly formal\nor old-fashioned to some. Similarly, it is possible to say \"med det samme\" in\nNorwegian instead of \"straks\"; the same is true in Danish, where it's possible\nto say both \"straks\" and \"med det samme\" in the above context.\n\n## Writing system[edit]\n\n### Danish and Norwegian[edit]\n\nMain article: Danish and Norwegian alphabet\n\nGenerally, Norwegian orthography is more simplified and regularized and closer\nto actual pronunciation than Danish. As a rule, the graphic differences\nbetween the two languages do not reflect actual differences in pronunciation;\nwhile there are significant phonetic and phonological differences, they are\nrarely expressed in writing. The few exceptions are noted below.\n\n  * In writing, Danish may employ either the letter \u27e8e\u27e9 or the letter \u27e8\u00e6\u27e9 to signify the short vowel phoneme /\u025b/. Norwegian almost always uses \u27e8e\u27e9. Example: Danish l\u00e6gge (to lay), sende (to send) versus Norwegian legge, sende.\n  * Danish regularly, although not always, uses the letter combinations \u27e8nd\u27e9, \u27e8ld\u27e9 instead of the double consonant letters \u27e8nn\u27e9, \u27e8ll\u27e9. In most cases this is not etymologically justified. In Norwegian and Swedish, only the etymologically justified spellings occur. Example: Danish kende (to know, Old Norse kenna), denne (this /common gender/, ON masculine accusative \u00feenna) and sende (to send, ON senda) versus Norwegian kjenne (Bokm\u00e5l) / kjenna (Nynorsk), denne (but sende); Danish ilde (bad, ON illa), ville (to want, Old Norse vilja) and holde (to hold, Old Norse halda) versus Norwegian ille, ville (but holde (Bokm\u00e5l) / halda/halde (Nynorsk)).\n  * Unlike Norwegian, Danish often uses \u27e8ds\u27e9 instead of double \u27e8s\u27e9. Example: ridse (to scratch) but visse (certain [plural]) versus Norwegian risse, visse. Likewise in some other contexts, Danish bedst (best), sidst (last) versus Norwegian best, sist (ON bezt, sizt, where \u27e8z\u27e9 denoted consonant combinations like \u27e8ds\u27e9 etc.).\n  * Unlike Norwegian, Danish does not use double consonants at the end of words. Example: Danish vis can signify both the adjective pronounced /vi\u02d0\u02c0s/ (wise) and the adjective pronounced /ves/ (certain), even though the plural forms of the adjectives, where the consonant occurs medially, are distinguished in writing by means of a double \u27e8s\u27e9 in the second word (vise versus visse). In contrast, Norwegian does distinguish between vis and viss in the same way as between vise and visse.\n  * Danish preserves the above rule both before inflexional and derivational endings, beginning in a consonant, and in compounding. Norwegian, too, prohibits word-final double consonants before inflexional endings, beginning in a consonant, (unless homography needs to be avoided), but not before derivational endings and in compounding. Example: Danish al (all /common gender/) \u2013 alt (all /neuter gender/) \u2013 alle (all /plural/) \u2013 altid (always, literally \"all time\"); Norwegian all \u2013 alt \u2013 alle, but alltid.\n  * Norwegian has preserved the spellings \u27e8gj\u27e9, \u27e8kj\u27e9, and \u27e8skj\u27e9 in the beginning of words when followed by \u27e8e\u27e9, \u27e8\u00e6\u27e9, \u27e8\u00f8\u27e9, while modern Danish has simply \u27e8g\u27e9, \u27e8k\u27e9 and \u27e8sk\u27e9. Today, this in part reflects the fact that these words are also pronounced differently in the two languages, see below. Examples: Danish gemme (keep, hide), k\u00e6r (dear), sk\u00f8n (wonderful, lovely) versus Norwegian gjemme (Bokm\u00e5l), kj\u00e6r, skj\u00f8nn.\n  * A pair of diphthongs are spelled as \u27e8ej\u27e9 and \u27e8\u00f8j\u27e9 in Danish, but as \u27e8ei\u27e9 and \u27e8\u00f8y\u27e9 in Norwegian. The exact pronunciation of these diphthongs is also somewhat different in the two languages, see below, and the different spellings are phonetically justified at least for the second diphthong. Examples: Danish vej (way), l\u00f8j (lied /past tense/) versus Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l vei, l\u00f8y.\n  * In the oblique case forms of the 1st and 2nd person pronouns and of reflexive pronouns, the ei/ej diphthong is spelled \u27e8ig\u27e9 in Danish, but \u27e8eg\u27e9 in Norwegian: mig, dig, sig versus meg, deg, seg.\n  * In Danish, the preposition af \"of, from\" is spelled with \u27e8f\u27e9 (pronounced [\u00e6] or, in compounds, [\u0251w]), whereas Norwegian has av with \u27e8v\u27e9 like Swedish.\n  * In loanwords, Danish generally has tended to partly preserve the spelling of the source language, whereas Norwegian traditionally usually has adapted the spelling to its own rules in order to reflect the expected pronunciation. Examples: Danish bureau (bureau), chauff\u00f8r (chauffeur), information (information), garage (garage), centrum (centre), zone (zone) versus Norwegian byr\u00e5, sj\u00e5f\u00f8r, informasjon, garasje, sentrum, sone.\n  * Traditional Danish punctuation requires that a comma be placed before and after every dependent clause, and although two recent reforms permit, optionally, the dropping of a comma before the dependent clause, the old system is still in general use.^[7] In contrast, Norwegian only requires a comma after the dependent clause; a comma is placed before it only if the clause is parenthetic (the same rule as in English, but English also does not put a comma after a non-parenthetic clause).^[8] Swedish uses the same rule as English: a comma is not required before or after a non-parenthetic clause. Example where the dependent clause is parenthetic \u2013 Norwegian: John, som hadde sett mannen, visste hvordan han s\u00e5 ut (English: John, who had seen the man, knew what he looked like). Example sentence with nonparenthetic clause:\n\nTop Level Structure| Subject| Verb| Object  \n---|---|---|---  \nDependent Clause 1  \nDependent Clause 2  \nDanish| Jeg| ved| ,| hvordan manden| ,| (som) du snakker om| ,| ser ud| .  \nNorwegian (Bokm\u00e5l)| Jeg| vet| hvordan mannen| (som) du snakker om| ,| ser ut|\n.  \nNorwegian (Nynorsk)| Eg| veit| korleis mannen| (som) du snakkar om (som) du\ntalar om| ,| ser ut| .  \nSwedish| Jag| vet| hur mannen| (som) du snackar om [colloquial] (som) du talar\nom (som) du pratar om| ser ut| .  \nEnglish| I| know| how the man| (that) you're talking about| looks| .  \n  \n  * Danish capitalizes all words in multi-word proper designations, but Norwegian and Swedish only capitalize the first word: Det Hvide Hus (Danish) \u2013 Det hvite hus (Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l) \u2013 Det kvite huset (Norwegian Nynorsk) \u2013 Vita huset (Swedish) \u2013 the White House (English).\n\n### Swedish differences[edit]\n\nSwedish orthography differs from Danish and Norwegian in the following\nrespects:^[9]\n\n  * Danish and Norwegian use the letters \u27e8\u00e6\u27e9 and \u27e8\u00f8\u27e9, but Swedish uses \u27e8\u00e4\u27e9 and \u27e8\u00f6\u27e9. All the three languages use the letter \u27e8\u00e5\u27e9.\n  * Danish and Norwegian use \u27e8kk\u27e9, but Swedish uses \u27e8ck\u27e9. Danish might also use a single 'k' finally, even for short vowels.\n  * Swedish uses the letter \u27e8x\u27e9 in native words, but Danish and Norwegian use \u27e8ks\u27e9 instead.\n  * In Swedish orthography, the etymological \u27e8hv\u27e9 was abolished in 1906. Danish and Bokm\u00e5l Norwegian still use it, although in some Norwegian words it is simplified to \u27e8v\u27e9 (verv, virvel, veps and optionally in verken/hverken). In Nynorsk, it is written \u27e8kv\u27e9 following truly Norwegian pronunciation.\n  * Swedish uses \u27e8g\u27e9, \u27e8k\u27e9, \u27e8sk\u27e9 before all front vowels like Danish, although pronounces them as palatals unlike Danish.\n  * Swedish, like Norwegian, mostly spells /kt/ as \u27e8kt\u27e9, whereas Danish uses \u27e8gt\u27e9'.\n  * Swedish uses the spelling och (and), whereas Danish and Norwegian use og.\n  * Use of double consonants in Swedish generally coincides with that in Norwegian, but Norwegian uses \u27e8at\u27e9, \u27e8et\u27e9, \u27e8skal\u27e9, \u27e8vil\u27e9, \u27e8til\u27e9, \u27e8mis-\u27e9, \u27e8mann\u27e9, \u27e8menn\u27e9, \u27e8munn\u27e9, \u27e8venn\u27e9, \u27e8inn\u27e9, \u27e8enn\u27e9 and Swedish uses \u27e8att\u27e9, \u27e8ett\u27e9, \u27e8skall\u27e9, \u27e8vill\u27e9, \u27e8till\u27e9, \u27e8miss-\u27e9, \u27e8man\u27e9, \u27e8m\u00e4n\u27e9, \u27e8mun\u27e9, \u27e8v\u00e4n\u27e9, \u27e8in\u27e9, \u27e8\u00e4n\u27e9.\n  * Swedish uses double consonants before \u27e8l\u27e9, \u27e8n\u27e9, \u27e8r\u27e9, \u27e8j\u27e9, \u27e8d\u27e9, \u27e8t\u27e9, but Norwegian uses single consonants.\n  * Danish and Norwegian preserve the morphological spelling \u27e8-dt\u27e9, but in Swedish it was replaced by \u27e8tt\u27e9 (or by \u27e8t\u27e9 after consonants and unstressed vowels) by the 1906 spelling reform.\n  * The use of the letter \u27e8\u00e4\u27e9 in Swedish is much more frequent than the use of \u27e8\u00e6\u27e9 in Danish, not to mention Norwegian. In particular, Swedish uses \u27e8\u00e4\u27e9 in the combination \u27e8j\u00e4\u27e9, which mostly corresponds to \u27e8je\u27e9 in Danish.\n  * Swedish \u27e8ts\u27e9 corresponds to Danish \u27e8ds\u27e9 and Norwegian \u27e8s\u27e9 or \u27e8ss\u27e9.\n  * Some verbs in Swedish have two infinitives: more commonly used short one and more formal long one: be/bedja, bli/bliva, ge/giva, ha/hava, ta/taga. In Norwegian, only short form is used (except be/bede); written Danish has only long form.\n  * Spelling of loanwords is intermediate between conservative Danish and progressive Norwegian. In particular, various spelling of \u27e8s\u27e9 and \u27e8sj\u27e9 sounds are usually retained in Swedish, but replaced in Norwegian.\n  * Danish and Norwegian use ordinal dot for writing ordinal numbers, but Swedish uses colon and ending: 5. (Danish and Norwegian), 5:e (Swedish). Although ordinal dot in Swedish was formerly used, now it occurs only in military contexts, such as 5. komp (5th company). Dates in Swedish are written without the ordinal suffixes, e. g. 5 juni; in Danish and Norwegian the ordinal dot is used: 5. juni.\n\n## Pronunciation and sound system[edit]\n\nThe difference in pronunciation between Norwegian and Danish is much more\nstriking than the difference between Norwegian and Swedish. Although written\nNorwegian is very similar to Danish, spoken Norwegian more closely resembles\nSwedish.\n\nDanish pronunciation is typically described as 'softer', which in this case\nrefers mostly to the frequent approximants corresponding to Norwegian, Swedish\nand historical plosives in some positions in the word (especially the\npronunciation of the letters b, d, and g), as well as the German-like\nrealisation of r as a uvular or even pharyngeal approximant in Danish as\nopposed to the Norwegian alveolar trills or uvular trills/fricatives.\n\nNote that in the following comparison of Danish, Norwegian and Swedish\npronunciation, the East Norwegian pronunciation of Oslo is taken as the norm.\nIn practice, most Norwegians will speak a local dialect in most contexts;\nfurthermore, Bokm\u00e5l itself is not a spoken standard, and is likely to be\npronounced with clearly regional features. The most obvious instances are the\nuvular (rather than alveolar) pronunciation of /r/ and the lack of retroflexes\nin much of Western Norway, and the pronunciation, in some cases, of a\nretroflex flap instead of /l/ in much of Eastern Norway, including the less\n\"refined\" forms of the Oslo dialect. All of this is ignored in the following\nexposition.\n\n### Vowels[edit]\n\nArguably the most acoustically striking differences in vowels are that:\n\n  * In Danish, the grapheme a corresponds, in most contexts, to the pronunciation of a front, often even open-mid front vowel ([\u00e6]), closer to the English short a. In Norwegian and Swedish, a is invariably an open back vowel [\u0251]. Example: Danish bane versus Norwegian bane (course, orbit).\n  * The grapheme u corresponds to (more or less close) back vowels in Danish, but usually to a close central vowel (/\u0289/) in Norwegian and Swedish. Example: Danish [hu\u02d0\u02c0s] versus Norwegian [h\u0289\u02d0s].\n\nAs a whole, Norwegian and Swedish still preserve the old pairs of short and\nlong vowels, as suggested by the writing system, pretty close to each other,\neven though the long ones are usually closer. Thus, the grapheme e corresponds\nto long [e\u02d0] (Norwegian and Swedish sene [se\u02d0n\u0259], late [plural]) and short [\u025b]\n(Norwegian sende [s\u025bn\u02d0\u0259], to send; Swedish hetta [\u02c8h\u025b\u0302ta], heat), while the\ngrapheme i corresponds to long [i\u02d0] (Norwegian sine [si\u02d0n\u0259], Swedish sina\n[si\u02d0na], his/her/its/their own) and short [\u026a] (sinne [s\u026an\u02d0\u0259], anger\n[Norwegian]/mind [Swedish]). In Danish, the tendency of differentiation has\nled to a qualitative overlapping: also here, e can stand for long [e\u031d\u02d0] (sene\n[se\u031d\u02d0n\u0259], late [plural]) and for short [e] (sende [sen\u0259], to send), but i,\nbesides signifying long [i\u02d0] (sine [si\u02d0n\u0259], his/her/its/their own), has come\nto correspond to short [e\u031d] ([nogen]sinde [se\u031dn\u0259], ever) and, to complicate\nthings further, a short [i] pronunciation is maintained in some cases (sidste\n[sist\u0259], last). Most Danish vowels have also many segmentally conditioned\nallophones, especially more open ones when preceded or followed by /r/ .\n\nThe following is a table that compares the most common Danish, Norwegian and\nSwedish pronunciations of a letter (without taking into account the grouping\nof sounds into phonemes, as well as many sub-rules, exceptions and\nsubtleties). Note that in many cases, even when the same IPA transcription is\nused, the sounds may still be somewhat different in the three languages.\n\nGrapheme| Quantity| Danish| Norwegian| Swedish^[10]  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n/V/| /rV/| /Vr/  \na| long| [\u025b\u02d0]| [\u0281\u0251\u02d0]| [\u0251\u02d0]| [\u0251\u02d0]| [\u0251\u02d0]  \nshort| [\u00e6], [\u0251]^1)| [\u0281\u0251]| [\u0251\u02d0]| [\u0251]| [a]  \ne| long| [e\u031d\u02d0]| [\u0281\u025b\u02d0]| [e\u031d\u02d0\u0250, \u025b\u02d0\u0250]| [e\u02d0]| [e\u02d0]  \nshort| [e]| [\u0281\u0251], [\u0281\u00e6] ^2)3)| [\u025b\u0250]| [\u025b] ^2)| [\u025b]  \nunstressed| [\u0259]| [\u0250]| [\u0250]| [\u0259]| [\u025b]  \ni| long| [i\u02d0]| [\u0281i\u02d0]| [i\u02d0\u0250]| [i\u02d0]| [i\u02d0]  \nshort| [e\u031d], [i]| [\u0281e], [\u0281i]| [i\u0250]| [\u026a]| [i]  \no| long| [o\u02d0]| [\u0281o\u02d0]| [o\u02d0\u0250]| [u\u02d0] ^4)| [\u028a\u02d0]  \nshort| [\u028c], [\u0254] ^6)| [\u0281\u028c]| [\u0252\u02d0], [o\u0250]| [\u0254] ^5)| [\u028a], [\u0254]  \nu| long| [u\u02d0]| [\u0281u\u02d0 > \u0281o\u02d0]| [u\u02d0\u0250]| [\u0289\u02d0]| [\u0289\u02d0]  \nshort| [\u0254] ^7), [u]| [\u0281\u0254] ^7), [\u0281u > \u0281o]| [u\u0250]| [\u0289], [u]| [\u0275]  \ny| long| [y\u02d0]| [\u0281y\u02d0]| [y\u02d0\u0250]| [y\u02d0]| [y\u02d0]  \nshort| [\u00f8] ^7), [y]| [\u0281\u0153] ^7), [\u0281y]| [y\u0250], [\u0276\u0250] ^8)| [y]| [y]  \n\u00e6 / \u00e4| long| [e\u02d0]| [\u0281\u025b\u02d0]| [\u025b\u02d0\u0250]| [\u00e6\u02d0] ^9)| [\u025b\u02d0] ^11)  \nshort| [e]| [\u0281\u0251], [\u0281\u00e6] ^3)| [\u025b\u0250]| [\u00e6]| [\u025b] ^11)  \n\u00f8 / \u00f6| long| [\u00f8\u02d0]| [\u0281\u0153\u02d0]| [\u00f8\u02d0\u0250]| [\u00f8\u02d0]| [\u00f8\u02d0]  \nshort| [\u00f8]| [\u0281\u0153], [\u0281\u0276] ^10)| [\u0276\u0250]| [\u0153]| [\u0153]  \n\u00e5| long| [\u0254\u02d0]| [\u0281\u0254\u02d0]| [\u0252\u02d0]| [o\u02d0]| [o\u02d0]  \nshort| [\u028c]| [\u0281\u028c]| [\u0252\u02d0]| [\u0254]| [\u0254]  \n  \n    ^1) before labials and velars\n    ^2) But [\u00e6] before /r/\n    ^3) before velars\n    ^4) But [o\u02d0] before /\u0261, v/\n    ^5) but, in some cases, [u] (notably before rt, nd, and sometimes st)\n    ^6) in some words before /\u028b/, /s/, /n/, /m/ (< older \u014d)\n    ^7) almost universally before /m, n, \u014b/\n    ^8) only in fyrre \"40\"\n    ^9) But [\u025b\u02d0], when, by exception, not followed by /r/\n    ^10) before /n/\n    ^11) before /r/ realised as [\u00e6\u02d0] and [\u00e6], long and short respectively.\n\nWhile the more open realisations of /\u025b/ and /\u025b\u02d0/ before /r/ are allophonic in\nDanish, they have acquired phonemic status as /\u00e6/ and /\u00e6\u02d0/ in Norwegian, and\nthe Norwegian letter \u00e6 has come to be used almost only to signify them. The\nphonologisation of /\u00e6/ was mostly a collateral effect of the merger of some\nother sounds: Danish \u00e6 /\u025b\u02d0/ versus e /e\u02d0/ and sj /sj/ versus rs /\u0250\u032fs/ have\ncome to be pronounced in the same way in Norwegian (respectively /e\u02d0/ and\n/\u0282/), thus rendering the occurrences of /\u00e6/ unpredictable.\n\n### Diphthongs[edit]\n\nThe Danish diphthongs [\u0251j] and [\u028cw] (spelled as ej and \u00f8j) correspond to the\nNorwegian diphthongs (in Oslo pronunciation) [\u00e6\u026a\u032f] and [\u0153\u028f\u032f] (spelled as ei\nand \u00f8y) and to Swedish [\u025bj] and [\u0153j] (spelled as ej and \u00f6j). Besides that, a\ngreat many letter combinations are pronounced as diphthongs in Danish, but as\nusual vowel-consonant combinations in Norwegian and Swedish. That is mostly\ndue to the Danish letters g and v (colloquially also b) being pronounced as\nsemivowels [j] and [w] after a vowel: thus, dag (day) is pronounced [t\u025b\u02d0\u02c0(j)]\nin Danish, but [d\u0251\u02d0\u0261] in Norwegian and Swedish; lov (law) is pronounced [l\u028cw]\nin Danish, but [lo\u02d0v] in Norwegian and Swedish. Similarly, [\u0251j] and [\u028cw] are\noften spelled as eg and \u00f8g in Danish (eg may be pronounced [\u00e6\u026a\u032f] in Norwegian,\ntoo, e.g. in regne, \"to rain\"). The Danish pronunciation is therefore, as with\na above, closer to English, while the Norwegian and Swedish is more\nconservative, closer to its spelling.\n\n  * A significant sound correspondence (rather than simply a difference in pronunciation) is the fact that Danish and Swedish have long monophthongs (e /e\u02d0/, \u00f8 /\u00f8\u02d0/) in some words, where Norwegian has restored the reflexes of old Norse diphthongs (ei [\u00e6\u026a\u032f], \u00f8y [\u0153\u028f\u032f] and au [\u00e6\u0289\u032f]) as alternatives or, sometimes, replacement of the Danish ones. Examples: Danish ben, Swedish ben (leg, bone) \u2013 Norwegian ben or bein; Danish h\u00f8, Swedish h\u00f6 (hay) \u2013 Norwegian h\u00f8y; Danish h\u00f8j, Swedish h\u00f6g (hill) \u2013 Norwegian haug.\n  * Another correspondence: Old Norse j\u00f3 and j\u00fa became ju in Swedish but y in Danish. Norwegian sometimes uses Danish forms, sometimes forms with jo and ju as in Old Norse. For example: Old Norse lj\u00f3ss \u2013 Danish lys \u2013 Norwegian lys (Bokm\u00e5l), lys or ljos (Nynorsk) \u2013 Swedish ljus (light).\n\n### Consonants[edit]\n\nThe most notable differences are, as already mentioned, the pronunciation of\napproximants in Danish, corresponding to voiced and voiceless stops in\nNorwegian and Swedish and of r as a uvu-pharyngeal approximant in Danish,\ncorresponding to an alveolar trill in (East) Norwegian and Swedish (except\nsouthern dialects) (skrige, \"shriek\" versus skrike, skrika). Furthermore,\nDanish has replaced the voiceless/voiced opposition (in /p, t, k/ versus /b,\nd, \u0261/) with an aspirated/nonaspirated one ([ph, tsh, kh] versus [p, t, k]),\nand the contrast between the two is neutralized syllable-finally and before\nschwa (in practice, in the core of native words, this means it is lost\neverywhere except word-initially). Thus, begge (both) and b\u00e6kke (brooks) are\npronounced alike as [p\u025bg\u0259]. In Norwegian and Swedish, the opposition is still\nvoiced versus voiceless and it is preserved everywhere, with /p, t, k/ being\naspirated in the onset of a stressed syllable (as in English and German).\n\nLetter| Danish| Norwegian| Swedish  \n---|---|---|---  \nIn stressed onset| Elsewhere (single)| Elsewhere (double)| In stressed onset|\nElsewhere| In stressed onset| Elsewhere  \nv| [v]| [w]| [w]| [\u028b]| [\u028b]| [v]| [v]  \nb| [p]| [p, w]| [p]| [b]| [b]| [b]| [b]  \np| [ph]| [p]| [p]| [ph]| [p]| [ph]| [p]  \nd| [t]| [\u00f0\u0320\u02d5\u0263]| [\u00f0\u0320\u02d5\u0263]| [d]| [d]| [d]| [d]  \nt| [tsh]| [t]| [t]| [th]| [t]| [th]| [t]  \ng| [k]| [-, j, w]| [k]| [\u0261]| [\u0261]| [\u0261]| [\u0261]  \nk| [kh]| [k]| [k]| [kh]| [k]| [kh]| [k]  \nr| [\u0281]| [\u0250\u032f, -]| [\u0250\u032f]| [r]| [r]| [r]| [r]  \n  \nThe Danish /r/ is either vocalized or dropped altogether, after having\ninfluenced the adjacent vowels, in all positions but word-initially and pre-\nstress, making the Danish r very similar to the standard German r. Also, note\nthe Danish pronunciation of initial t as [tsh], similar to the High German\nconsonant shift wherein German changed t to z/tz (cf. Danish tid, German\nZeit).\n\nMeanwhile, syllable-final b, v, d, and g may be compared to English syllables\nthat end in y, w, and th (English \"say\" versus Danish sige, \"law\" versus lov,\n\"wrath\" versus vrede).\n\nSome letter combinations that are pronounced quite differently are:\n\n  * rd, rl, rn, rs, rt are pronounced as spelled in Danish (with the /r/ dropped), but in the part of Norway using trilled r, they are always or almost always merged into retroflex consonants ([\u0256], [\u026d], [\u0273], [\u0282], [\u0288]), as in Swedish.\n  * sj is pronounced [\u0255] in Danish, but as [\u0282] in most of Norway and as [\u0267] in Swedish.\n\nSome notable sound correspondences are:\n\n  * Danish has /b/ (spelled b), /\u00f0/ (spelled d), and [j, w] (spelled g) after long stressed vowels, where Norwegian and Swedish have restored/preserved the /p/, /t/ and /k/ from Old Norse. Examples: Danish fod (foot), reb (rope), syg (sick) \u2013 Norwegian fot, rep, syk/sjuk \u2013 Swedish fot, rep, sjuk \u2013 Old Norse f\u00f3tr, reip, sj\u00fakr. In a handful of cases, however, Bokm\u00e5l Norwegian has kept the Danish form (lege, doctor, tegn, sign, bedre, better versus Old Norse l\u00e6knari, teikn, betri). In most of these cases, the Nynorsk equivalents have retained the old consonants (l\u00e6kjar (variant form), teikn, betre).\n  * Sometimes Danish has /v/ ([w], spelled v) after originally long stressed vowels, where Norwegian and Swedish have restored/preserved /\u0261/ from Old Norse. Example: Danish skov (forest), mave (belly) \u2013 Norwegian skog, mage \u2013 Swedish skog, mage \u2013 Old Norse sk\u00f3gr, magi. However, in many cases Norwegian has kept the Danish form (lyve \"tell a lie\" \u2013 Old Norse lj\u00faga), and variation is permitted (mave, lyge, and even ljuge).\n  * Danish has /\u0261/, /k/, and /sk/ (spelled g, k and sk) in stressed syllable onsets, where Norwegian usually has /j/, /\u00e7/ and /\u0282/ before front vowels (spelled as in Danish before i, y, ei and \u00f8y, and gj, kj and skj elsewhere). Examples: Danish gemme (keep, hide), k\u00e6r (dear), sk\u00f8nt (although), gyse (shiver), kilde (source, spring) versus Norwegian gjemme, kj\u00e6r, skj\u00f8nt, gyse, kilde (Bokm\u00e5l)/kjelde (Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk). Swedish has /j/, /\u0255/ and /\u0267/, spelled as in Danish: g\u00f6mma, k\u00e4r, k\u00e4lla.\n  * Additionally, the letter g is pronounced /j/ in Swedish in the final consonant combinations -lg and -rg, but not in Danish and Norwegian.\n  * The consonant combinations skj, kj, tj, gj are pronounced simply as consonant clusters in Danish, but in Norwegian and Swedish they represent single consonants: Norwegian skj /\u0282/, kj, tj /\u00e7/, gj /j/; Swedish skj /\u0267/, kj, tj /\u0255/, gj /j/. The combinations dj and stj represent consonant clusters in Danish and Norwegian and the consonants /j/ and /\u0267/ respectively in Swedish. The combination lj is pronounced /j/ in Norwegian and Swedish, not used in Danish (Norwegian ljore \u2013 Danish lyre, \"hole in the roof\"; Swedish ljus \u2013 Danish and Norwegian lys [Nynorsk also ljos], \"light\"). On the other hand, hj is pronounced /j/ in all the three languages.\n  * The consonant combinations nd and ld are pronounced the same as nn and ll in Danish and Norwegian. In Swedish, they are pronounced as written.\n\n### Prosody[edit]\n\nIn Norwegian and Swedish, each stressed syllable must contain, phonetically,\neither a long vowel or a long (geminate) consonant (e.g. male [m\u0251\u02d0l\u0259], \"to\npaint\" versus malle [m\u0251l\u02d0\u0259], \"catfish\") . In Danish, there are no\nphonologically long consonants, so the opposition is between long and short\nvowels ([m\u00e6\u02d0l\u0259] versus [mal\u0259]). All the three languages have a prosodic\nopposition between two \"accents\", derived from syllable count in Old Norse and\ndetermined partly phonologically, partly morphologically and partly lexically.\nHowever, the exact nature of this prosodic contrast is very different. In\nNorwegian and Swedish, the contrast is between two tonal accents, accent 1 and\n2, which characterise a whole word with primary stress; in Danish, it is\nbetween the presence and the absence of the st\u00f8d (a kind of laryngealisation),\nwhich characterises a syllable (though usually a syllable that bears at least\nsecondary stress). Example: Danish l\u00f8ber \"runner\" [\u02c8l\u00f8\u02d0p\u0250] versus l\u00f8ber \"runs\"\n[\u02c8l\u00f8\u02d0\u02c0p\u0250], Norwegian l\u00f8per^2 [l\u00f8\u0302\u02d0p\u0259r] versus l\u00f8per^1 [l\u00f8\u0300\u02d0p\u0259r], Swedish\nl\u00f6pare^2 [l\u00f8\u0302\u02d0par\u025b] versus l\u00f6per^1 [l\u00f8\u0300\u02d0p\u025br]. Note Danish landsmand\n[\u02c8lan\u02c0sman\u02c0] \"compatriot\" (one word, two st\u00f8ds) as opposed to Norwegian\nlandsmann [l\u0251\u0300nsm\u0251n\u02d0] and Swedish landsman [l\u0251\u0300nsm\u0251n\u02d0] (one word, one accent).\n\nNote: The pronunciation of the tone accents varies widely between Norwegian\ndialects; the IPA tone accent transcriptions above reflect South-East\nNorwegian pronunciation (found e.g. in Oslo). There is usually also high pitch\nin the last syllable, but it is not transcribed here, because it belongs to\nthe prosody of the phrase rather than the word.\n\n### Vowels in inflections[edit]\n\nDanish, Norwegian and Swedish in inflections (declension, conjugation) attach,\nalbeit to a limited extent, endings. These endings are always unstressed and\ncontain only short vowels. The use of vowels in these endings depends on the\ndegree of reduction, which is highest in Danish. It allows only reduced <e> in\nendings, pronounced as [\u0259]. Bokm\u00e5l most often has reduced <e> in endings, less\noften also <a>. Nynorsk uses <a> more often, other vowels less often. Swedish\nhas the lowest reduction rate. It allows most vowels in endings, while the\nbasic vowel in inflections is <a>.\n\nExamples:\n\nGrammar| Danish| Bokm\u00e5l| Nynorsk| Swedish| Meaning  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nNouns: singular and plural| gade \u2013 gader| gate \u2013 gater| gate \u2013 gater| gata \u2013\ngator| street \u2013 streets  \ndag \u2013 dage| dag \u2013 dager| dag \u2013 dagar| dag \u2013 dagar| day \u2013 days  \nsoldat \u2013 soldater| soldat \u2013 soldater| soldat \u2013 soldatar| soldat \u2013 soldater|\nsoldier \u2013 soldiers  \nhus \u2013 huse| hus \u2013 hus| hus \u2013 hus| hus \u2013 hus| house \u2013 houses  \nNouns: definite plural form| dagene| dagene| dagane| dagarna| the days  \nAdjectives: definite form| store| store| store| stora (store)| the big  \nAdjectives: degrees of comparison| st\u00e6rkere \u2013 st\u00e6rkest| sterkere \u2013 sterkest|\nsterkare \u2013 sterkast| starkare \u2013 starkast| stronger \u2013 the strongest  \nVerbs: infinitive| kaste| kaste| kaste/kasta| kasta| to throw  \n  \n### Rendering of Graeco-Latin ae (\u03b1\u03b9) and oe (\u03bf\u03b9)[edit]\n\nWhile Danish renders Graeco-Latin ae (\u03b1\u03b9) as \u00e6 (with some exceptions:\nEtiopien, \u00c6gypten/Egypten), Norwegian and Swedish mostly use e. For example,\nDanish \u00e6kvivalent \u2014 Norwegian and Swedish ekvivalent (equivalent). In\nNorwegian, \u00e6 is kept before r: \u00e6ra, kim\u00e6re, sf\u00e6re; Swedish has chim\u00e4r, sf\u00e4r\nbut era. \"Caesar\" is spelled C\u00e6sar in Danish and Norwegian; Swedish uses\nunligatured spelling Caesar, pronounced as if spelled *Cesar.\n\nGraeco-Latin oe (\u03bf\u03b9) is rendered as \u00f8 in Danish and Norwegian, but as e in\nSwedish: Danish and Norwegian \u00f8kologi \u2014 Swedish ekologi (ecology).\n\n## Grammatical differences[edit]\n\n### Nominal morphology[edit]\n\n#### Gender[edit]\n\nDanish and Swedish have two grammatical genders \u2013 common (indefinite article\nen and definite article -en) and neuter (indefinite article et [Danish]/ett\n[Swedish] and definite article -et). In Norwegian, the system is generally the\nsame, but some common words optionally use special feminine gender declension\npatterns, which have been preserved from Old Norse in Norwegian dialects and\nwere re-introduced into the written language by the language reforms of the\nearly 20th century. Hence, three genders are recognized \u2013 masculine\n(morphologically identical to Danish common, with indefinite article en and\ndefinite article -en), feminine (indefinite article ei and definite article\n-a) and neuter (morphologically identical to its Danish counterpart, with\nindefinite article et and definite article -et, pronounced /\u0259/). The\nlikelihood of a feminine as opposed to common form being used depends on the\nparticular word, as well as on style: common gender forms are often more\nformal or sometimes even bookish, while feminine forms tend to make a more\ncolloquial and sometimes even rustic impression. Both variants are standard in\nBokm\u00e5l, whereas only the three-gender model is accepted in Nynorsk. Examples:\nDanish en mand \u2013 manden (\"a man \u2013 the man\"), en sol \u2013 solen (\"a sun \u2013 the\nsun\"), et hus \u2013 huset (\"a house \u2013 the house\") versus Norwegian en mann \u2013\nmannen (\"a man \u2013 the man\"), ei sol \u2013 sola or en sol \u2013 solen (\"a sun \u2013 the\nsun\"), et hus \u2013 huset (\"a house \u2013 the house\").\n\nThe Norwegian feminine can also be expressed in the indefinite singular\ndeclension of the word liten, which has a special feminine form lita beside\nthe neuter lite. Danish has only lille, which is the definite singular form in\nboth languages.\n\n#### Number[edit]\n\nIn Danish, the plural endings are -er, -e or zero-ending. The choice of ending\nis difficult to predict (although -er is especially common in polysyllables,\nloanwords and words ending in unstressed e; -e is most usual in monosyllables;\nand zero-ending is most usual in neuter monosyllables). In Norwegian, the\nplural suffix -e is used too, but the system is rather regularized, since it\nis only nouns ending with -er in uninflected form that get -e in indefinite\nplural form, and this is current for both masculine, feminine and neuter\nnouns; en skyskraper \u2013 skyskrapere \"a skyscraper \u2013 skyscrapers\"; en hamburger\n\u2013 hamburgere \"a hamburger \u2013 hamburgers\"; et monster \u2013 monstre \"a monster \u2013\nmonsters\"; et senter \u2013 sentre \"a center \u2013 centers\". The ending -er (-ar in\nNynorsk) is dominant in masculine/feminine nouns and some neuters with several\nsyllables, while zero-ending is prevalent in neuter gender monosyllables.\nExamples: Danish en appelsin \u2013 appelsiner, en hund \u2013 hunde, et hus \u2013 huse, et\nfald \u2013 fald, versus Norwegian en appelsin \u2013 appelsiner, en hund \u2013 hunder, et\nhus \u2013 hus, et fall \u2013 fall (singular and plural forms of \"orange\", \"dog\",\n\"house\" and \"fall\"). Swedish has five plural endings: -er, -or, -ar, -n and\nthe zero ending (see the tables above and below).\n\nIn addition, the formation of the definite plural forms are somewhat different\nin the three languages. In Danish, plural forms in -er transform into definite\nplural -erne, while plurals in -e and zero-ending become -ene. Norwegian has\ngeneralized -ene (-ane in Nynorsk) for nearly all masculine and feminine\nwords, and an -ene or -a for neuter words. A few masculine words also have an\nalternative ending -a, derived from -a(ne)/-\u00e6ne in the spoken language (en\nfeil \u2013 feila/feilene, \"a mistake/error \u2013 the mistakes/errors\"). Examples:\nDanish en sag \u2013 sager \u2013 sagerne, en dag \u2013 dage \u2013 dagene, et fald \u2013 fald \u2013\nfaldene, et ben \u2013 ben \u2013 benene versus Norwegian en sak \u2013 saker \u2013 sakene, en\ndag \u2013 dager \u2013 dagene, et fall \u2013 fall \u2013 fallene, et be(i)n \u2013 be(i)n \u2013\nbe(i)na/be(i)nene (singular, plural, and plural definite forms of \"thing\",\n\"day\", \"fall\" and \"bone\"/\"leg\"). Swedish adds -na to -er, -or, -ar; -a to -n;\n-en to zero ending.\n\nDanish| Bokm\u00e5l| Nynorsk| Swedish| Meaning  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nen gade \u2013 gaden gader \u2013 gaderne| en/ei gate \u2013 gaten/gata gater \u2013 gatene| ei\ngate \u2013 gata gater \u2013 gatene| en gata \u2013 gatan gator \u2013 gatorna| street  \nen dag \u2013 dagen dage \u2013 dagene| en dag \u2013 dagen dager \u2013 dagene| ein dag \u2013 dagen\ndagar \u2013 dagane| en dag \u2013 dagen dagar \u2013 dagarna| day  \nen sol \u2013 solen sole \u2013 solene| en/ei sol \u2013 solen/sola soler \u2013 solene| ei sol \u2013\nsola soler \u2013 solene| en sol \u2013 solen solar \u2013 solarna| sun  \nen soldat \u2013 soldaten soldater \u2013 soldaterne| en soldat \u2013 soldaten soldater \u2013\nsoldatene| ein soldat \u2013 soldaten soldatar \u2013 soldatane| en soldat \u2013 soldaten\nsoldater \u2013 soldaterna| soldier  \nen mus \u2013 musen mus \u2013 musene| en/ei mus \u2013 musen/musa mus \u2013 musene| ei mus \u2013\nmusa mus/myser \u2013 musene/mysene| en mus \u2013 musen m\u00f6ss \u2013 m\u00f6ssen| mouse  \net hus \u2013 huset huse \u2013 husene| et hus \u2013 huset hus \u2013 husene/husa| eit hus \u2013\nhuset hus \u2013 husa| ett hus \u2013 huset hus \u2013 husen| house  \net barn \u2013 barnet b\u00f8rn \u2013 b\u00f8rnene| et barn \u2013 barnet barn \u2013 barna/barnene| eit\nbarn \u2013 barnet born/barn \u2013 borna/barna| ett barn \u2013 barnet barn \u2013 barnen| child  \net \u00e6ble \u2013 \u00e6blet \u00e6bler \u2013 \u00e6blerne| et eple \u2013 eplet epler \u2013 eplene/epla| eit eple\n\u2013 eplet eple \u2013 epla| ett \u00e4pple \u2013 \u00e4pplet \u00e4pplen \u2013 \u00e4pplena| apple  \n  \n#### Definiteness[edit]\n\nIn the three languages, single nouns use a postpositive definite article.\nHowever, in Danish, when a noun is modified by an adjective, a prepositive\ndefinite article is used instead of the postpositive one. Norwegian and\nSwedish both add a prepositive article and keep the postpositive. Example:\nDanish hus \u2013 huset, et stort hus \u2013 det store hus versus Norwegian hus \u2013 huset,\net stort hus \u2013 det store huset and Swedish hus \u2013 huset, ett stort hus \u2014 det\nstora huset (indefinite and definite forms of \"a/the house\" and \"a/the big\nhouse\"). In proper designations, Swedish only keeps the postpositive article,\nand Bokm\u00e5l does not add it: Det Hvide Hus (Danish) \u2013 Det hvite hus (Norwegian\nBokm\u00e5l) \u2013 Det kvite huset (Norwegian Nynorsk) \u2013 Vita huset (Swedish) (the\nWhite House). The same difference applies when a demonstrative pronoun is\nused: Danish Jeg elsker den mand versus Norwegian Jeg elsker den mannen and\nSwedish Jag \u00e4lskar den mannen (I love that man).\n\n#### Adjectives[edit]\n\nThe declension of adjectives is basically the same in the three languages.\nMost of them form two forms in a single number: for the common gender (in\nNorwegian masculine and feminine) and for the neuter gender. In the plural,\nboth genders have one form, which is at the same time a definite form, which\nis connected with nouns with a definite article.\n\nIn neuter forms, Swedish consistently appends the suffix -t (-tt) - except for\nthe inflected adjectives of type bra (good). In Danish and even more often in\nNorwegian (especially Nynorsk) for some adjectives -t are not added:\n\nsvensk (Danish, Norwegian) - svenskt (Swedish) = Swedish\n\nbilligt (Danish, Swedish) - billig (Bokm\u00e5l) - billeg (Nynorsk) = cheap\n\nIn Swedish, the spelling simplifies the group -dt (in neuter forms) to -tt:\ngod / godt (Danish, Norwegian) - god / gott (Swedish) = good.\n\nDefinite and plural forms have the suffix -e in Danish and Norwegian, while -a\nin Swedish:\n\nsvenske s\u00f8er (Danish) - svenske sj\u00f8er (Bokm\u00e5l) - svenske sj\u00f8ar (Nynorsk) -\nsvenska sj\u00f6ar (Swedish) = Swedish lakes\n\ndet gamle hus (Danish) - det gamle huset (nor.) - det gamla huset (Swedish) =\n(the) old house\n\nIn Swedish, definite forms of the original masculine gender with the ending -e\nare also possible in a singular number (only for male people): den gamle /\ngamla mannen = (the) old man.\n\n#### Pronouns[edit]\n\n  * To denote second person plural, Danish uses I (oblique form jer, possessive pronoun jeres), while Norwegian uses dere (oblique dere, possessive deres). Swedish uses ni (oblique and possessive er); the variant I (oblique eder, possessive eder or eders) is obsolete.\n  * The 1st person plural possessive pronoun (\"our\") is vores (uninflected) in modern Danish, but v\u00e5r (inflected: neuter v\u00e5rt, plural v\u00e5re [Norwegian] or v\u00e5ra [Swedish]) in Norwegian and Swedish. Example: Danish vores ven/hus/venner versus Norwegian v\u00e5r venn/v\u00e5rt hus/v\u00e5re venner or, like in the spoken language, vennen v\u00e5r/huset v\u00e5rt/vennene v\u00e5re (\"our friend/house/friends\"). In Danish, the original inflected variant vor (vort, vore) occurs only in more solemn or archaic style.\n  * The possessive pronouns always precede what they are modifying in Danish and Swedish; in Norwegian, they may also be placed after a definite noun or noun phrase. The choice of construction in Norwegian depends on the particular word and on style (the Danish-like construction is more formal or emphatic, the other one is more colloquial). Example: Danish min ven, min nye ven \u2014 Swedish min v\u00e4n, min nya v\u00e4n \u2014 Norwegian vennen min or min venn, den nye vennen min or min nye venn (\"my friend\", \"my new friend\"). Nynorsk does not allow the Danish construction, which in Bokm\u00e5l was inherited from Danish.\n  * The reflexive possessive pronoun sin (\"his/her/its own\") can't refer to a plural subject in Danish, but it can do so in Norwegian and Swedish. Example: Danish Han vasker sine kl\u00e6der like Norwegian Han vasker kl\u00e6rne sine and Swedish Han vasker sina kl\u00e4der (\"He is washing his [own] clothes\"); but Danish De vasker deres kl\u00e6der versus Norwegian De vasker kl\u00e6rne sine and Swedish De vasker sina kl\u00e4der (\"They are washing their [own] clothes\").\n  * In Danish, the pronoun that expresses an unspecified, generalized person or group (corresponding to English \"one\", French \"on\" and German \"man\") is man in its main form, but its oblique form is en and its genitive form is ens. In Norwegian and Swedish, en can also be used as a main form. Example: Danish man kan ikke g\u00f8re det versus Norwegian man/en kan ikke gj\u00f8re det and Swedish man/en kan inte g\u00f6ra det (\"one/people can't do that\").\n  * In Danish and Swedish, the pronouns \"such\" and \"so (=in this way)\" are usually translated with s\u00e5dan (slig [Danish]/slik [Swedish] is obsolete and solemn). In Norwegian, the most usual form is slik, but s\u00e5dan is also correct (s\u00e5nn can be somewhat colloquial).\n  * In Danish, Bokm\u00e5l and Swedish, the pronouns han and hun (Danish and Bokm\u00e5l)/hon (Swedish) refer to male and female people, but den and det are used for other common- and neuter-gender nouns. Nynorsk uses han for masculine nouns, ho for feminine nouns, det for neuter nouns.\n  * In Danish and Norwegian, the pronoun de (they) is pronounced [di\u02d0], but in Swedish its usual pronunciation is [d\u0254m\u02d0]; the same pronunciation is used for its oblique case dem, which in Danish and Norwegian is pronounced according to the spelling.\n\n#### Numerals[edit]\n\nThere are significant differences between the numeral systems of Danish and\nNorwegian.\n\n  * In Danish, the number 7 is called syv. In Norwegian, it is called sju (although the 2005 language reform re-introduced syv as an alternative to sju).\n  * In Danish, 20 and 30 are called tyve and tredive. These forms (with tredive shortened to tredve) were replaced in Norwegian in 1951 by the native tjue /\u00e7\u0289\u02d0\u0259/ and tretti. Like syv, which was replaced by sju at the same time, they still occur in Norwegian. The unofficial Riksm\u00e5l standard retains the old forms.\n  * In Danish, the number 40 is called fyrre. In Norwegian, it is f\u00f8rti, although f\u00f8rr is permitted in riksm\u00e5l.\n  * In Danish, the tens between 50 and 90 have different roots from the ones in most Germanic languages. Etymologically, like French numerals for 70, 80 and 90, they are based on a vigesimal system; in other words, the name of the number is based on how many times 20 it is. Thus, 60 is tres (short for tresindstyve, \"3 times 20\") and 50 is halvtreds (short for halvtredsindstyve, \"2.5 times 20\" or more literally \"half-third times 20\"). Similarly, 70 is halvfjerds, 80 is firs, and 90 is halvfems. In Norwegian, these numbers are constructed much like in English and German, as compound words of the respective unit and an old word for \"ten\": 50 = femti, 60 = seksti, 70 = sytti /s\u00f8t\u02d0i/, 80 = \u00e5tti, 90 = nitti.\n  * In Danish, units are placed before tens (as in German and Early Modern English); in Norwegian, the reverse applies (as in Modern English), although the Danish order is also used by some speakers. Example: Danish enogtyve (\"one-and-twenty\") versus Norwegian tjueen (\"twenty-one\") or enogtyve.\n  * With regard to ordinal numbers, \"second\" has pretty much the same form in the two languages: anden (neuter andet, plural andre) in Danish and annen (neuter annet, plural andre) in Norwegian. However, Danish does not have a definite form but says den anden, whereas Norwegian uses den andre.\n\nSwedish numerals are similar to Norwegian ones: sju (7), tjugo (20), trettio\n(30), fyrtio (40), femtio (50), sextio (60), sjuttio (70), \u00e5ttio (80), nittio\n(90), tjugoen (21), andra (the second).\n\n### Verbal morphology[edit]\n\n  * Danish regular verbs can be divided in those that form their past tense and past participle with the suffixes -ede and -et /\u0259\u00f0/, respectively, (e.g. \"to throw\", kaste \u2013 kastede \u2013 kastet) and those that form them with the suffixes -te and -t (e.g. \"to read\", l\u00e6se \u2013 l\u00e6ste \u2013 l\u00e6st). Although the group in -ede, -et is the largest one, the choice between these two conjugation patterns is mostly unpredictable. The corresponding Norwegian groups use -et, -et (kaste \u2013 kastet \u2013 kastet), and -te, -t (lese \u2013 leste \u2013 lest). However, unlike Danish, the choice of conjugation has come to be governed by a rule (with a few exceptions): verb stems containing a short vowel, followed by a long consonant or a consonant cluster (as in ramme), use -et, and verb stems containing a long vowel, followed by a short consonant (as in male), use -te (Danish ramme \u2013 ramte \u2013 ramt versus Norwegian ramme \u2013 rammet \u2013 rammet \"to hit\"; Danish male \u2013 malede \u2013 malet versus Norwegian male \u2013 malte \u2013 malt \"to paint\"). In addition, verb stems ending in a stressed vowel form a third group with no parallel in Danish, using the endings -dde, -dd (\"to live [somewhere]\" \u2013 bo \u2013 bodde \u2013 bodd). The corresponding Danish verbs nearly always use -ede, -et (bo \u2013 boede \u2013 boet). Swedish uses the endings -ade, -ad, -de, -d and -dde, -dd, where d or dd is replaced by t or tt in the neuter.\n\n    Bokm\u00e5l has also introduced the optional use of the ending -a (taken from Norwegian dialects and used as the only allowed form in Nynorsk) instead of -et: thus, kaste \u2013 kasta \u2013 kasta, ramme \u2013 ramma \u2013 ramma, etc. The use of forms in -a is more common in speech than in writing. Nynorsk also allows infinitive ending in -a: kaste/kasta \u2013 kasta \u2013 kasta. Swedish also ends infinitives in -a.\n\n  * Some Danish irregular verbs have longer forms, ending in unstressed -de, -ge and -ve, which have been dropped in Norwegian. In many cases, the Danish verbs may also be pronounced in the contracted way. Examples: Danish lade \u2013 lod \u2013 ladet, sige \u2013 sagde \u2013 sagt, blive \u2013 blev \u2013 blevet versus Norwegian la \u2013 lot \u2013 latt, si \u2013 sa \u2013 sagt, bli \u2013 ble(i) \u2013 blitt (\"let\", \"say\", \"become\"). Other examples are tage \u2013 tog \u2013 taget versus ta \u2013 tok \u2013 tatt (\"to take\"), have \u2013 havde \u2013 haft versus ha \u2013 hadde \u2013 hatt (\"to have\"), etc.. The same reduction exists in some verbs in Swedish (e. g. bli \u2013 blev \u2013 bliven [besides the formal infinitive bliva]).\n  * The perfect forms in Danish may be formed either with the auxiliary verb have \"to have\" (as in English) or with v\u00e6re \"to be\". Some verbs always use v\u00e6re (ske \"happen\", holde op \"stop\"), while others can use both auxiliaries, but with slightly different meanings: han har rejst \"he has travelled (spent some time travelling)\" emphasizes the action itself, while han er rejst \"he has left (so he isn't here now)\" emphasizes the result of the action. In Norwegian and Swedish, ha \"to have\" may be \u2013 and increasingly is \u2013 used in all cases, and no specific verbs require v\u00e6re/vara: han er d\u00f8d (Danish) - han har d\u00f8dd (Bokm\u00e5l) - han har d\u00f8ydd / d\u00f8ytt (Nynorsk) - han har d\u00f6tt (Swedish) = he has died.\n  * Danish and Norwegian use the past participle in perfect tenses, but Swedish uses a different form, the supine. For weak verbs, it is identical to the neuter gender of the participle, but for strong verbs, the neuter of the participle ends in -et but the supine ends in -it.\n  * The past participle in Swedish is consistently inflected as an adjective. The participle of most verbs has three clearly distinguished forms (two in the singular for the common and neuter gender; one for both genders in the plural, which is also a definite form). The participle must agree with the noun in the gender and the number, whether placed before the noun or after another verb:\n\nBiljetterna blev k\u00f6pta och betalade. = Tickets have been bought and paid for.\n\nIn Danish and Bokm\u00e5l, declension of participles is simplified. From most\nverbs, only a definite and indefinite form is formed, without distinction of\ngender. For strong verbs, some Danish verbs have preserved a form in a common\ngender with the ending -en (as in Swedish). If the participle comes after a\nverb, grammatical agreement does not apply in both languages:\n\nBilleterne blev k\u00f8bt og betalt. (Danish) - Billettene ble kj\u00f8pt og betalt.\n(Bokm\u00e5l) = Tickets have been bought and paid for.\n\nIn Nynorsk, as in Swedish, most participles are inflected, but some are\nindeclined (for example, the forms na -a: elska - see the table below).\nGrammatical agreement in the sentence is mandatory only for strong verbs, for\nweak verbs it is applied optionally and for some verbs it is not applied at\nall.\n\nThe present participles in all Scandinavian languages are indeclinable.\n\n  * S-forms of verbs, i. e. forms ending in -s (in Nynorsk -st), have three uses in all Scandinavian languages:\n\n    * deponent verbs - verbs in passive form with active meaning;\n    * reciprocal verbs - verbs expressing reciprocity;\n    * passive voice, the so-called s-passive.\n\nDeponent and reciprocal verbs are common to all languages. However, the use of\ns-forms is different. In Swedish, the passive voice is commonly expressed in\nthis way (although the s-passive is more formal than the analytical passive).\nThe suffix -s can be appended to any verb form (including supine) except for\nparticiples. In Danish and Norwegian, the s-passive is of limited use. In\nDanish and Bokm\u00e5l, only the passive forms of the infinitive and the present\ntense are more commonly formed in this way. In Nynorsk, the ending -st can\nonly be added to the infinitive that follows the modal verb, e.g.: Ingenting\nkunne gj\u00f8rast. = There was nothing that could be done. Otherwise, the passive\nmust be expressed analytically, or avoided altogether.\n\n  * Some examples of verbs in the three languages:\n\nLove| Danish| Bokm\u00e5l| Nynorsk| Swedish  \n---|---|---|---|---  \ninfinitive| elske| elske| elske/elska| \u00e4lska  \npresent| elsker| elsker| elskar| \u00e4lskar  \npast| elskede| elsket/elska| elska| \u00e4lskade  \nperfect/pluperfect| har/havde elsket| har/hadde elsket/elska| har/hadde elska|\nhar/hade \u00e4lskat  \npast participle (passive)| elsket elskede| elsket/elska elskete/elskede/elska|\nelska| \u00e4lskad \u00e4lskat \u00e4lskade  \npresent participle| elskende| elskende| elskande| \u00e4lskande  \nimperative| elsk| elsk| elsk| \u00e4lska  \nForget| Danish| Bokm\u00e5l| Nynorsk| Swedish  \n---|---|---|---|---  \ninfinitive| glemme| glemme/gl\u00f8mme| gl\u00f8yme/gl\u00f8yma| gl\u00f6mma  \npresent| glemmer| glemmer/gl\u00f8mmer| gl\u00f8ymer| gl\u00f6mmer  \npast| glemte| glemte/gl\u00f8mte| gl\u00f8ymde| gl\u00f6mde  \nperfect/pluperfect| har/havde glemt| har/hadde glemt/gl\u00f8mt| har/hadde gl\u00f8ymt|\nhar/hade gl\u00f6mt  \npast participle (passive)| glemt glemte| glemt/gl\u00f8mt glemte/gl\u00f8mte|\ngl\u00f8ymd/gl\u00f8ymt gl\u00f8ymt gl\u00f8ymde| gl\u00f6md gl\u00f6mt gl\u00f6mda  \npresent participle| glemmende| glemmende/gl\u00f8mmende| gl\u00f8ymande| gl\u00f6mmande  \nimperative| glem| glem/gl\u00f8m| gl\u00f8ym| gl\u00f6m  \nLive| Danish| Bokm\u00e5l| Nynorsk| Swedish  \n---|---|---|---|---  \ninfinitive| bo| bo| bu| bo  \npresent| bor| bor| bur| bor  \npast| boede| bodde| budde| bodde  \nperfect/pluperfect| har/havde boet| har/hadde bodd| har/hadde budd/butt|\nhar/hade bott  \npast participle (passive)| boet boete| bodd bodde| budd budd/butt budde| bodd\nbott bodda  \npresent participle| boende| boende| buande| boende  \nimperative| bo| bo| bu| bo  \nSing| Danish| Bokm\u00e5l| Nynorsk| Swedish  \n---|---|---|---|---  \ninfinitive| synge| synge| syngje/syngja| sjunga  \npresent| synger| synger| syng| sjunger  \npast| sang| sang| song| sj\u00f6ng  \nperfect/pluperfect| har/havde sunget| har/hadde sunget| har/hadde sunge/sungi|\nhar/hade sjungit  \npast participle (passive)| sungen sunget sungne| sunget sungne| sungen\nsunge/sungi sungne| sjungen sjunget sjungna  \npresent participle| syngende| syngende| syngande| sjungande  \nimperative| syng| syng| syng| sjung  \n  \n### Miscellaneous[edit]\n\nCertain words present in all the three languages are used differently in each.\nThis can result in identical sentences meaning different things in the three\nlanguages, or in constructions that make sense in one language becoming\nnonsensical in another one.\n\nExamples include:\n\n  * m\u00e5/kan \u2013 The word \"m\u00e5\" usually means \"must\" in Norwegian, but can mean \"may\", \"can\", or \"must\" in Danish. Swedish uses kan for \"can\", m\u00e5ste for \"must\", and f\u00e5r or m\u00e5 for \"may\".\n  * der/som \u2013 Danish has both words for \"which\", although der is only used as the grammatical subject. In Norwegian, der is only used archaically or poetically. Swedish uses som, and vilken, vilket, vilka.\n  * nogle/nogen \u2013 in written Danish the counterparts of the English words \"some\" (in a plural sense) and \"any\" are spelled nogle and nogen, respectively \u2013 although in speech, nogle is pronounced just like nogen. In contrast, in Norwegian both are spelled identically, as noen (from Danish nogen). Swedish uses n\u00e5gon, n\u00e5gra, en del, or somliga.\n  * kun/bare \u2013 in Danish, kun means roughly \"only, solely\" (referring to quantity or number) and bare \"just, merely\". Kun is used more often in Denmark, whereas bare is used more often in Norway. While there are rules in Danish that govern when to choose which word, in Norwegian bare may be \u2013 and usually is \u2013 used with both meanings. Swedish uses bara, endast or enkom.\n  * meget/mye \u2013 in Norwegian, the adverb meget (alternatively veldig etc.) modifies adjectives just like English \"very\", while mye is used like English \"much, a lot\". In Danish, meget is used in both cases. Swedish typically uses mycket or v\u00e4ldigt for \"very\", and mycket for \"much\".\n  * enda/enn\u00e5 (ennu) \u2013 in Norwegian, enn\u00e5 means \"still, yet\" in a temporal sense, but enda, which normally means \"yet, nevertheless\" among other things, is used in conjunction with comparative forms in expressions such as enda bedre, \"better still\". In Danish, endnu (the equivalent of enn\u00e5) is used in both cases. Swedish uses \u00e4n, \u00e4nnu for \"yet\", \"still\" while \u00e4nde or \u00e4nda means \"the end\" (much like slut does).\n  * The primary difference in preposition usage in the Danish and Norwegian languages is the use of i / p\u00e5, (in English in / on). Although the two are generally used similarly in both languages, in certain cases the two languages choose a different preposition for the same construction. For example, \"a quarter to five\" would be kvart i fem in Danish, but kvart p\u00e5 fem in Norwegian. To express a period of time during which something has happened, Danish always uses i, but Norwegian uses i in affirmative and p\u00e5 in negative sentences: Danish jeg har (ikke) set ham i to \u00e5r versus Norwegian jeg har sett ham i to \u00e5r, jeg har ikke sett ham p\u00e5 to \u00e5r (\"I have [not] seen him for two years\"). Swedish uses forms like kvart i fem, and ... sett honom i tv\u00e5 \u00e5rs tid, but ... inte sett honom p\u00e5 tv\u00e5 \u00e5r.\n  * genitive constructions \u2013 unlike Danish, Norwegian very often uses the preposition til (\"to\") as a more informal alternative of genitive constructions: boka til Peter, or Peters bok versus Danish Peters bog. Norwegian also uses a construction with the reflexive pronoun, Peter sin bok, (Lit. Peter his book). This is in Norwegian bokm\u00e5l called \"garpegenitiv\" and is (in bokm\u00e5l) still considered substandard by some.^[11] Swedish is like Danish in this regard, except in some rural dialects.\n\n## Vocabulary[edit]\n\n### Geographical names[edit]\n\n#### Names of countries[edit]\n\nDanish has adopted many German (particularly from Low German variants spoken\nby the Hanseatic League) words and grammatical structures, while Bokm\u00e5l has\nrejected some of these imports. An example is the naming of countries; Danish\nand Swedish generally use the German names of countries, or at least the\nGerman ending.\n\nThese names were used in Norwegian as well, but have in modern times (during\nthe second half of the 20th century) to a large extent been replaced by the\nLatin endings; this means that the usual ending is -a in Norwegian and -en or\n-et in Danish (the -en and -et endings are also the definite articles). In the\ncase of Switzerland, which is known in written Danish and Swedish by its\nGerman name Schweiz, this is transliterated in Norwegian as Sveits.^[12]\n\nAs a result, Australien, Italien and Spanien are used in Danish and Swedish,\nbut as Australia, Italia and Spania in Bokm\u00e5l, although the earlier forms can\nbe heard in speakers of more conservative forms (for instance Queen Sonja of\nNorway). Similarly, while Mongolia and Slovakia are now used in Norwegian,\nMongoliet and Slovakiet/Slovakien are still used in Danish and Swedish.\n\nIn Danish, Latvia is referred to as Letland, similar to German Lettland (which\nis used in Swedish), whereas in Norwegian, it is referred to as Latvia\n(although Letland and Lettland were previously used), but Estonia and\nLithuania are referred to in the three languages as Estland and Litauen, as in\nGerman.\n\nOther differences include the use in Norwegian of the native names of\ncountries. In Danish, Greece is referred to as Gr\u00e6kenland and in Swedish as\nGrekland, but in Norwegian, it is mostly referred to as Hellas (the Greek form\nof the name), even though the Danish-like Grekenland is sometimes used.^[13]\nSimilarly, the name for Cyprus in Norwegian is the Greek-derived\nKypros,^[14]^[15] rather than the Cypern (influenced by the German Zypern)\nused in Danish and Swedish.^[16]\n\nNevertheless, Norwegians usually use greker (noun) and gresk (adjective) for\n\"Greek\", not hellener (noun) and hellensk (adjective); the latter are used\nonly when talking about Ancient Greece, in the sense of Hellenic, as in\nEnglish and other languages.\n\nIn addition, Norwegian speakers, unlike Danish speakers, refer to the\nNetherlands as Nederland, as in Dutch, not as Holland, although Nederlandene\nis used in Danish in the same formal sense as \"The Netherlands\" would be in\nEnglish. In Swedish, the form Nederl\u00e4nderna is used. Similarly the Dutch\nlanguage is known as nederlandsk in Norway and nederl\u00e4ndska in Sweden, but is\nmost often called hollandsk in Denmark (the Norwegian dictionary\nBokm\u00e5lsordboka identify both Holland and hollandsk as previously commonly used\nin Norwegian).^[17]\n\nBy contrast, both Norwegian and Danish speakers refer to New Zealand by its\nEnglish name (but Ny-Zealand is also used in Norwegian^[18]), whereas Swedish\nspeakers call the country Nya Zeeland.^[19] However, \"New Zealand\" as an\nadjective is newzealandsk or nyzealandsk in Norwegian,^[20] whereas\nnewzealandsk is encountered in Danish,^[21] In Danish, \"New Zealander\" is\nnewzeal\u00e6nder^[22] while in Norwegian it can be translated as either\nnewzealender or nyzealender.^[23]\n\nEnglish| Danish| Norwegian (Bokm\u00e5l/Nynorsk)| Swedish  \n---|---|---|---  \nAlbania| Albanien| Albania| Albanien  \nAlgeria| Algeriet| Algerie| Algeriet  \nArmenia| Armenien| Armenia| Armenien  \nAustralia| Australien| Australia| Australien  \nAustria| \u00d8strig| \u00d8sterrike/Austerrike| \u00d6sterrike  \nBelarus| Hviderusland (recently more commonly Belarus^[24])| Belarus\n(Hviterussland/Kviterussland were official forms until 2022) ^[25]|\nVitryssland (recently more commonly Belarus^[26])  \nBelgium| Belgien| Belgia| Belgien  \nBosnia and Herzegovina| Bosnien-Hercegovina| Bosnia-Hercegovina| Bosnien och\nHercegovina, Bosnien-Hercegovina, Bosnien  \nBrazil| Brasilien| Brasil| Brasilien  \nBulgaria| Bulgarien| Bulgaria| Bulgarien  \nCambodia| Cambodja| Kambodsja| Kambodja  \nCameroon| Cameroun| Kamerun| Kamerun  \nCanada| Canada| Canada| Kanada  \nCape Verde| Kap Verde| Kapp Verde| Kap Verde  \nCentral African Republic| Den Centralafrikanske Republik| Den\nsentralafrikanske republikk| Centralafrikanska republiken  \nChad| Tchad| Tsjad| Tchad  \nComoros| Comorerne| Komorene| Komorerna  \nCongo, Republic of| Republikken Congo| Republikken Kongo| Kongo-Brazzaville,\nRepubliken Kongo  \nCroatia| Kroatien| Kroatia| Kroatien  \nCyprus| Cypern| Kypros| Cypern  \nCzech Republic, Czechia| Den Tjekkiske Republik, Tjekkiet| Den tsjekkiske\nrepublikk, Tsjekkia| Tjeckien  \nDemocratic Republic of Congo| Den Demokratiske Republik Congo| Den\ndemokratiske republikken Kongo| Kongo-Kinshasa, Demokratiska republiken Kongo  \nEast Timor| \u00d8sttimor| \u00d8st-Timor/Aust-Timor| \u00d6sttimor, Timor-Leste  \nEgypt| Egypten, \u00c6gypten| Egypt| Egypten  \nEquatorial Guinea| \u00c6kvatorialguinea| Ekvatorial-Guinea| Ekvatorialguinea  \nEthiopia| Etiopien| Etiopia| Etiopien  \nFrance| Frankrig| Frankrike| Frankrike  \nGeorgia| Georgien| Georgia| Georgien  \nGreece| Gr\u00e6kenland| Hellas| Grekland  \nIndia| Indien| India| Indien  \nIndonesia| Indonesien| Indonesia| Indonesien  \nItaly| Italien| Italia| Italien  \nLatvia| Letland| Latvia| Lettland  \nLibya| Libyen| Libya| Libyen  \nNorth Macedonia| Nordmakedonien| Nord-Makedonia| Nordmakedonien  \nMauritania| Mauretanien| Mauritania| Mauritania  \nMicronesia, Federated States of| F\u00f8derale statsforbund Mikronesien|\nMikronesiaf\u00f8derasjonen| Mikronesiens federerade stater, Mikronesiska\nfederationen  \nMongolia| Mongoliet| Mongolia| Mongoliet  \nMozambique| Mozambique, Mocambique| Mosambik| Mo\u00e7ambique  \nNorth Korea| Nordkorea| Nord-Korea| Nordkorea  \nPhilippines| Filippinerne| Filippinene| Filippinerna  \nRomania| Rum\u00e6nien| Romania| Rum\u00e4nien  \nSaudi Arabia| Saudi-Arabien| Saudi-Arabia| Saudiarabien  \nSerbia| Serbien| Serbia| Serbien  \nSlovakia| Slovakiet| Slovakia| Slovakien  \nSlovenia| Slovenien| Slovenia| Slovenien  \nSolomon Islands| Salomon\u00f8erne| Salomon\u00f8yene| Salomon\u00f6arna  \nSouth Africa| Sydafrika| S\u00f8r-Afrika| Sydafrika  \nSouth Korea| Sydkorea| S\u00f8r-Korea| Sydkorea  \nSouth Sudan| Sydsudan| S\u00f8r-Sudan| Sydsudan  \nSpain| Spanien| Spania| Spanien  \nSwitzerland| Schweiz| Sveits| Schweiz  \nSyria| Syrien| Syria| Syrien  \nTunisia| Tunisien| Tunisia| Tunisien  \nTurkey| Tyrkiet| Tyrkia| Turkiet  \nUkraine| Ukraine| Ukraina| Ukraina  \nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland| Det Forenede Kongerige\nStorbritannien og Nordirland| Det forente kongerike Storbritannia og Nord-\nIrland/Det sameinte kongeriket Storbritannia og Nord-Irland| Storbritannien,\nF\u00f6renade konungariket Storbritannien och Nordirland, F\u00f6renade kungariket  \n  \n#### Names of cities[edit]\n\nThere are also differences in the names of cities; each language choosing to\nuse the more native name, or one borrowed from another language. For example:\n\n  * Helsinki in Norwegian, is referred to as Helsingfors,^[27] as in Swedish, whereas in Danish it is usually called Helsinki, as in Finnish.^[28]\n  * Brussels in Danish, is referred to as Bruxelles, as in French, or sometimes Bryssel as in Swedish, while in Norwegian it is known as Brussel, as in Dutch (but Bruxelles was permitted until 1961).^[29]\n  * Lisbon in Norwegian, however, is known as Lisboa,^[30] as in Portuguese, whereas in Danish and Swedish it is known as Lissabon, as in German.^[31] (However, Lissabon was previously used in Norwegian).^[29]\n  * Prague is known in Danish and Swedish as Prag, as in German, unlike Norwegian, in which the Czech name Praha is used.^[32]\n  * Bucharest likewise, is known in Danish and Swedish as Bukarest, but in Norwegian the Romanian name Bucure\u0219ti is used.\n  * Belgrade is known in Danish and Norwegian under the Serbian name Beograd,^[33]^[34] but in Swedish the form Belgrad is used.\n  * Beijing likewise, is known in Danish and Norwegian in the pinyin spelling, but Swedish usually uses the form Peking.\n  * Moscow and Warsaw however, are known in all the three languages by their respective Russian and Polish names, Moskva^[35]^[36] and Warszawa.^[37]^[38]\n\n### Different words[edit]\n\nHere are some examples of common words and expressions that are different in\nthe three languages.
