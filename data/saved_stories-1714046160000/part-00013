Previously, these methods were not matched during reflection and an error was thrown.\n\nJava 21 added an overload to the method Thread/sleep in the 1-arity. When\nupgrading to Java 21, existing Clojure calls to Thread/sleep become\nreflective, but continue to work. As usual, you can detect reflection with\n*warn-on-reflection* and address with a type hint (here, ^long) to choose the\ndesired overload. Previously, passing a Short or Integer value to a reflective\ncall like Thread/sleep that takes a long would not match, that has been\ncorrected.\n\n###### Community\n\nResources Contributing Companies Site\n\n###### Legal\n\nLicense Privacy Policy\n\n###### Documentation\n\nOverview Reference API Guides Libraries & Tools\n\n###### Updates\n\nNews Events\n\n###### ETC\n\nClojureTV Books Swag\n\n###### Code\n\nReleases Source ClojureScript ClojureCLR\n\nCopyright 2008-2022 Rich Hickey | Privacy Policy Logo & site design by Tom Hickey\n\nPublished 2024-04-24 Update this page\n\n", "frontpage": false}
