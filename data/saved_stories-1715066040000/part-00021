That\u2019s a tiny fraction of the $63 billion Navy procurement budget\nproposed by President Joe Biden\u2019s administration for 2025.\n\nMilitary sea drones can range from missile-armed speed boats to minehunting\nminiature submarines and solar-powered sailboats equipped with high-definition\nspy cameras, underwater sensors and loudspeakers used to holler warnings at\nenemy ships.\n\nBut when the Navy has deployed sea drones on reconnaissance missions in recent\nyears, it hasn\u2019t always had the fleet expertise to use them, the two Navy\nsources said, asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nThere aren\u2019t enough Navy sailors trained to pilot drones or to analyze vast\nswathes of data sent back from the craft\u2019s cameras and sensors, the sources\nsaid.\n\nThe spokesperson said the Navy was in the process of improving its data\ncollection and analysis from sensors.\n\nPentagon spokesman Pahon said the DoD has been \u201claser-focused on accelerating\ninnovation over the last three years,\u201d including the use of sea drones.\n\nAcknowledging budget challenges, Pahon said the Pentagon was using innovative\nways to cross \u201cthe valley of death,\u201d a term used to describe the torturous\napproval process new inventions travel through to be purchased in large\nquantities.\n\n## REPLICATOR\n\nOne example Pahon cited was the Replicator program: the short-term, $500\nmillion-a-year project is designed to cut through bureaucracy and fast track\nthe deployment of thousands of cheap aerial and sea drones.\n\nThese drones will be used to match China\u2019s rapidly-growing air and naval power\nin the Asia-Pacific region, the Pentagon\u2019s Hicks said at the project\u2019s launch\nin August. She said Replicator is being funded mainly by reallocating funds\nfrom the existing Pentagon budget.\n\nAs part of the initiative, the Pentagon in January issued a solicitation for\nprivate companies to deliver small sea drones to the Navy, demanding\nproduction capacity of 120 vessels per year, with deployment beginning in\nApril 2025.\n\nDuane Fotheringham, president of unmanned systems at Huntington Ingalls\nIndustries (HII) HII.N, the largest U.S. military shipbuilder, acknowledged\nthe Pentagon and Navy had shown their \u201cintent\u201d to accelerate the deployment of\nsea drones but he said the industry wanted to see long-term funding in the\ndefense budget.\n\n\u201cWe hear the demand signal ... but we all have to work together very closely\nto understand what that demand is and when it will be available,\u201d Fotheringham\ntold Reuters.\n\nAt a cost ranging between $1 million and $3 million apiece, according to Navy\nand defense contractor sources, drones offer a relatively cheap and fast way\nto expand the Navy\u2019s fleet, especially as several large traditional\nshipbuilding projects \u2013 like a new class of frigate warships \u2013 are running\nyears behind schedule.\n\nThe U.S. is testing using robot ships in active combat scenarios. But their\nmore immediate use is for missions that are too costly and numerous for manned\nnaval fleets.\n\nThis includes maritime surveillance, minehunting, and protecting critical\nundersea infrastructure, like gas pipelines and fiber-optic cables, four drone\ncompanies told Reuters.\n\nSwarms of small sea drones could also act as a shield for valuable crewed\nassets like aircraft carriers and submarines, and tangle up troop-carrying\nships in the event China tries to invade Taiwan, said Bryan Clark, an advisor\nto the Navy on autonomous craft and a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute \u2013\na think tank headquartered in Washington.\n\nClark estimates the Navy has around 100 small drones for use on the ocean\nsurface and another 100 underwater drones, while China has a similar-sized\nautonomous force that is growing fast. The Navy spokesperson declined to\ncomment on how many drones it has in operation.\n\n\u201cUkraine has shown how effective they can be and how they can be employed in\ncurrent operations,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThe U.S. Navy needs to embrace that lesson\nand field combat (sea drones) right away.\u201d\n\nAn Arabian Fox MAST-13 unmanned surface vessel, attached to U.S. Naval Forces\nCentral Command\u2019s Task Force 59, conducts surveillance in the Arabian Gulf,\nNov. 21, 2023. U.S. Army Photo\n\nThe Navy\u2019s 5th fleet, which operates out of Bahrain, has been testing unmanned\nvessels for three years, led by its Task Force 59 unit.\n\nThe project has deployed surveillance drones built by private firms, including\nstartups, as well as those backed by defense heavyweights like Lockheed Martin\nand HII.\n\n\u201cThe situation in the Red Sea gives the work of Task Force 59 added urgency\nand we look forward to fielding solutions to help counter Houthi malign\nbehavior,\u201d Colin Corridan, commander of the task force, told Reuters.\n\nMISSILE TEST\n\nIn October, the Navy carried out its first live missile test from an unmanned\nspeedboat in the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nThe T38 Devil Ray, built by Florida-based sea drone firm MARTAC, successfully\nlaunched a miniature missile system to destroy a target boat, with a human\noperator ashore giving the order, according to a Navy announcement and video.\n\nMARTAC\u2019s Chief Marketing Officer, Stephen Ferretti, referred questions about\nthe operation to the Navy.\n\nThe use of unmanned vessels was expanded to the Navy\u2019s 4th Fleet in central\nAmerica last year where they have been used to crack down on human smuggling\noff the northern coast of Haiti.\n\nOne of the companies operating there is Saildrone, a California-based firm\nthat makes wind-, solar- and diesel-powered autonomous vessels that collect\nimages and data with cameras and sensors.\n\nSaildrone has circumnavigated Washington\u2019s funding politics. Because the\ncompany operates and maintains its own vessels, and charges a service fee for\nthe data they collect, the Navy can pay to use the drones out of its operating\nexpenses rather than procurement budget.\n\nSaildrone launched the Surveyor, its largest vessel, which has been tailored\nfor the military, at an event in March attended by Chief of Naval Operations\nLisa Franchetti.\n\nThe drone firm, which also supplies coast guards and ocean survey departments,\nhas a fleet of 130 vessels and is building several more every month, said\nRichard Jenkins, the company\u2019s founder.\n\n\u201cRight now, we are struggling to keep up with demand,\u201d Jenkins told Reuters in\nan interview. He declined to comment on how much Saildrone charges the Navy.\n\nOcean Aero builds the autonomous Triton vessel, which can move on the surface\nor underwater to collect data and hunt for mines using sensors. The company,\nwhich is backed by Lockheed Martin, opened a 63,000 feet manufacturing\nfacility in Gulfport, Mississippi last October that is capable of churning out\n150 Tritons a year.\n\nLockheed Martin did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHII was awarded a contract last October to build nine small underwater drones\nfor the U.S. Navy\u2019s Lionfish program, with the potential for this to rise to\n200 vehicles over the next five years. The contract could total $347 million,\nalthough that is far from guaranteed.\n\nThe Lionfish program \u2013 which is focused on the Indo-Pacific where the U.S. is\nvying for control with China \u2013 is based on HII\u2019s Remus 300, a minehunting\ndrone that can be launched like a torpedo from a crewed ship or submarine.\n\nThese programs are proof that the Pentagon is trying to move faster to deploy\nsea drones, spokesman Pahon told Reuters.\n\n\u201cWe know we need to keep pushing to stay ahead,\u201d he said.\n\n(Reporting by Joe Brock in Singapore and Mike Stone in Washington; Editing by\nDaniel Flynn)\n\n(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2024.\n\n### Tags:\n\nU.S. Navy\n\nUkraine War\n\nunited states\n\n## Unlock Exclusive Insights Today!\n\nJoin the gCaptain Club for curated content, insider opinions, and vibrant\ncommunity discussions.\n\nSign Up\n\nPrev Back to Main Next\n\n### Be the First to Know\n\nJoin the 105,862 members that receive our newsletter.\n\nHave a news tip?
