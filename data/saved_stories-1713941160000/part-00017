(AP) \u2014 Emerging cicadas are so loud in one South Carolina\ncounty that residents are calling the sheriff\u2019s office asking why they can\nhear sirens or a loud roar.\n\nThe Newberry County Sheriff\u2019s Office sent out a message on Facebook on Tuesday\nletting people know that the whining sound is just the male cicadas singing to\nattract mates after more than a decade of being dormant.\n\nSome people have even flagged down deputies to ask what the noise is all\nabout, Newberry County Sheriff Lee Foster said.\n\nThe nosiest cicadas were moving around the county of about 38,000 people,\nabout 40 miles (65 kilometers) northwest of Columbia, prompting calls from\ndifferent locations as Tuesday wore on, Foster said.\n\nTrillions of red-eyed periodical cicadas are emerging from underground in the\neastern U.S. this month. The broods emerging are on 13 or 17 year cycles.\n\nTheir collective songs can be as loud as jet engines and scientists who study\nthem often wear earmuffs to protect their hearing.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nPeriodic cicadas remain buried for years.
