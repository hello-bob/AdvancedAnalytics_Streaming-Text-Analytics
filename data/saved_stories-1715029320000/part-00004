If we\u2019re trying to categorize something,\nknowing what labeled bin to put it in is handy. If we\u2019re looking for trends,\nthen sharp boundaries are even better because they let us compare things in a\nsingle category to see how they change.\n\nThis tendency, though, can lead to trouble. It can mislead us or cause\nconfusion. Especially when we take something that is fundamentally fuzzy and\nindistinct and try to ram its square peg into a round hole.\n\nTake, for example, the solar system.\n\nIf you picture it in your head, you likely see the sun in the center and a\nretinue of planets orbiting it. At some point, perhaps around four billion to\nfive billion kilometers out, roughly equivalent to the orbital distance of\nNeptune, you might draw an imaginary line: everything within that line is\ninside the solar system, and everything beyond that line is outside it.\n\nYou may see where I\u2019m going with this. That line you drew in your head is\narbitrary and, I dare say, even wrong.\n\nFirst, well past this distance, there are icy bodies called trans-Neptunian\nobjects (TNOs) that are nonetheless still bound to the sun by gravity. Some\nTNOs orbit the sun in a flattish torus called the Kuiper belt, and others\norbit much, much farther out from a very roughly spherical halo called the\nOort cloud that potentially stretches for a trillion kilometers around our\nstar. On that scale, even the outer planets orbiting the sun seem huddled\nclose-in.\n\nAnd second, well, setting such outer limits depends on how you define what the\nsolar system is and what\u2019s outside it.\n\nI was reminded of this because of a space news story that came out just last\nweek, and it\u2019s good news (a rare gem): engineers have been able to get Voyager\n1 talking to Earth again. The deep-space probe was launched in 1977 and is now\na staggering 24 billion kilometers from Earth, which is more than 160 times\nfarther away from our planet than the sun is. Last November the spacecraft\nsuffered a hardware glitch that scrambled its communications, and engineers\nhad to get clever by rerouting software around the bad component. After they\nuploaded the fix, Voyager 1 appears to be working better, and they expect it\nwill be back to full operational duty in the next few months.\n\n## Curated by Our Editors\n\n  * ### After Months of Gibberish, Voyager 1 Is Communicating Well Again\n\nMeghan Bartels\n\n  * ### NASA Communicates with Ailing Voyager 1 Spacecraft\n\nNadia Drake\n\n  * ### Scientists Make Best-Yet Map of Solar System's Interstellar Boundaries\n\nTheo Nicitopoulos\n\n  * ### Proposed Interstellar Mission Reaches for the Stars, One Generation at a Time\n\nLee Billings\n\n  * ### Low-Earth Orbit Faces a Spiraling Debris Threat\n\nAneli Bongers & Jos\u00e9 L. Torres\n\nThis reminded me of something that happened in September 2013, when Voyager 1\nwas \u201cjust\u201d 19 billion kilometers from Earth: NASA announced that the\nspacecraft had entered interstellar space in August 2012. At the time, a lot\nof people talked about how Voyager had finally \u201cleft the solar system.\u201d\n\nAnd here\u2019s where we run into that second issue of where the solar system\n\u201cends.\u201d By any real definition, even the fuzzy ones, Voyager 1 was still well\nwithin the solar system\u2014certainly, it was (and still is, and will be for some\ntime) closer to the sun than most of the TNOs in the black depths of space\u2014yet\nNASA was correct: Voyager 1 is also in interstellar space.\n\nHow can this be?\n\nThis confusion arises because of two different ways of thinking of what\ndefines the solar system. In this case, we\u2019re comparing the sun\u2019s\ngravitational influence, exerted upon the objects orbiting it, and its\nmagnetic influence, delivered to deep space by its solar wind.\n\nThe solar wind is a stream of subatomic particles the sun continuously blows\ninto space. It flows away from the sun at high speed, nearly two million\nkilometers per hour, and consists of electrons, protons, neutrons and some\nheavier atomic nuclei as well. It\u2019s not clear what accelerates the wind to\nsuch high speeds. Scientists know the sun\u2019s magnetism is the driving force,\nbut the exact mechanism still isn\u2019t understood.\n\nIf space were truly empty, the solar wind would expand forever, flowing out\ninto the galaxy and, because it moves at such high speed, eventually exiting\nthe Milky Way entirely. But space\u2014despite the name\u2014is not empty. The vast\nvolume between the stars does in fact have matter in it. It\u2019s not much, to be\nsure: roughly one subatomic particle per cubic centimeter on average (although\nthat can change hugely depending on where exactly in space you are). The air\nyou\u2019re breathing right now is some 10 quintillion times denser, so this\ninterstellar matter is thin gruel indeed, but it\u2019s enough.\n\nAs the solar wind plows into this ethereally thin cosmic vapor, it loses\nmomentum and slow down, eventually coming to a halt. This region where it\nstalls out, poetically called the heliopause, marks the exterior boundary of\nthe heliosphere, the volume of space dominated by the sun\u2019s solar wind. Within\nthe heliopause region, the sun\u2019s magnetic influence wanes and that of the\ninterstellar medium\u2014the material between the stars\u2014strengthens.\n\nThis shift is just what Voyager 1 detected in 2012. Several measurements\nshowed that the interstellar medium dominated the region of space the\nspacecraft was passing through and that it had left the heliosphere behind.\n\nSo while Voyager 1 was still well inside the solar system, the space around it\nwas influenced more by the galaxy itself than the sun.\n\nAs usual, when dealing with scientific matters, you need to be careful to\ndefine your terms.\n\nAnd in the interest of open scientific honesty, I\u2019ll admit I\u2019ve made this\nmistake myself. I wrote in early 2013 that Voyager 1 had left the solar system\nwhen, in fact, NASA said at the time that it had not. (This happened so often\nin media over the years that the webcomic xkcd, in its usual cheeky style, had\nsomething to say about this topic as well. NASA later confirmed after\nreviewing its data that the spacecraft had actually entered interstellar space\nin 2012.) But I also pointed out at the time how hard-and-fast definitions of\neven where the sun\u2019s heliosphere ends are complicated and difficult to pin\ndown. These regions are squishy and in flux, lacking any easily measured\ndelineation.\n\nIf any of this sounds familiar, that\u2019s because it\u2019s reminiscent of pondering\nwhere Earth\u2019s atmosphere ends and outer space begins\u2014a quandary encapsulated\nby the debate over something called the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line. I covered this in a\nrecent article, and there are some similarities; in both cases, we\u2019re dealing\nwith a sort-of atmosphere\u2014the heliosphere carved out by the solar wind and\nEarth\u2019s enveloping shroud of air\u2014and where it impinges on the environment of\ndeeper space. The difference here is that Earth\u2019s atmosphere fades away\ngradually with altitude, blending seamlessly with the near vacuum of space,\nwhereas the heliosphere does have a boundary. That neutral zone (to borrow a\nStar Trek\u2013ism) is wide, certainly\u2014tens of billions of kilometers through\u2014but\nit\u2019s small compared to the immense size of the heliosphere itself.\n\nWith Voyager 1 having long passed the interstellar version of the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line,\nit\u2019s well on its way into the galaxy. It will hopefully continue to take\nmeasurements of the interstellar medium and begin transmitting them back to\nEarth soon once again. Even after 46 years, it\u2019s still breaking boundaries.\n\nRights & Permissions\n\nPhil Plait is a professional astronomer and science communicator in Virginia.\nHe writes the Bad Astronomy Newsletter.
