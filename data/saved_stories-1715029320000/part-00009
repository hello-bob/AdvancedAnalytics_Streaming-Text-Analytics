Under his leadership, and backed to the tune of $180 million by\nSam Altman, Retro built its laboratories, at a fraction of the usual cost,\nfrom re-fitted shipping containers. The company mission is to \u201cincrease\nhealthy human lifespan by ten years [...] by focusing on the cellular drivers\nof aging.\u201d\n\nRaised by countercultural parents in Oregon \u2014 and educated at Harvard, MIT,\nand Caltech \u2014 Betts-LaCroix counts invention and experimentation among his\nlifelong companions. His previous ventures include computer hardware startup,\nOQO, which created the world\u2019s smallest Windows device (a Guinness world\nrecord in 2006) and was sold to Google; and medical research automator, Vium,\nacquired by Recursion Pharma in 2020. He has been a part-time partner at\naccelerator, Y Combinator, and has invested in numerous startups.\n\nTry Big Think+ for your business\n\nEngaging content on the skills that matter, taught by world-class experts.\n\nRequest a Demo\n\nToday, at 62, he embodies an approach to work that seeks solutions at speed \u2014\nand his business philosophy is built on ideas and principles that would\nbenefit any leader, in any industry.\n\nIn true \u201csmarter, faster\u201d spirit, Big Think asked Betts-LaCroix about role\nmodels, startup culture, his implanted ID chip, and more. His fascinating and\ninsightful responses include our favorite hacked business maxim of the year so\nfar: \u201cMove fast and break ignorance.\u201d\n\nBig Think: How did your Oregon childhood of tinkering and curiosity shape your\ncurrent leadership philosophy?\n\nBetts-LaCroix: Curiosity comes from within: My models for leadership (my\nparents) didn\u2019t force interests on me. I love what I do because it\u2019s authentic\nto me, and that makes me productive, so I find that people who are doing their\nwork because they love it are a good fit. It\u2019s a quality I select for. To me,\nleadership is matching people with the challenges that fit them, as well as\nwhat excites them, and what they need for that next challenge.\n\nBig Think: Mentorship is a great way to pass on your experience to new waves\nof startups. What are some of the discoveries about leadership you try to\nimpress on startup neophytes?\n\nBetts-LaCroix: Trust yourself. You become a followable leader by being true to\nyour instincts. People can smell inauthenticity; if you try to be someone you\nare not, you become bland or worse. Don\u2019t let the conservatism of the world\nshrink your ambitions. Choose a startup that aligns with your actual values\nand desires, and that alignment will drive everything: fundraising,\nrecruiting, partnering, and most of all, yourself, during all the intense\ndoubts and challenges you will inevitably face.\n\n> Trust yourself. You become a followable leader by being true to your\n> instincts.\n\nBig Think: What are some of the leadership techniques and practices you use to\nencourage innovation at Retro?\n\nBetts-LaCroix: For one, I avoid the use of the word \u201cinnovation\u201d \u2014 I pretty\nmuch only hear it used by companies I classify as \u201cdead players.\u201d People will\nimmediately dismiss a culture tenet the CEO doesn\u2019t exemplify. So I invent\nconstantly and openly: I normalize it. I rarely take \u201cit\u2019s not typically done\nthis way\u201d as an answer if that means we have to go slowly; there\u2019s almost\nalways a way. Sometimes there isn\u2019t, but it\u2019s the optimistic sense that there\nprobably is that means I find one 90% of the time.\n\nBig Think: You have an RFID (radio-frequency identification) chip implanted in\nyour hand? What are the advantages of this enhancement and what does it tell\nyour team about your approach to leadership?\n\nBetts-LaCroix: I never have to worry about forgetting my key fob to the\nbuilding. I don\u2019t have a strong key habit because I don\u2019t own a car (it\u2019s more\nefficient to take Lyft because I can get work done on the way). But the main\nreason I like my chip is that it\u2019s fast: I don\u2019t have to fish a fob out of my\npocket or attach one to myself every day. I also like the feeling of\nconnecting my body with the company.\n\nI\u2019m a participant in our autophagy (cellular recycling) phase-0 trial. I give\nblood immediately when scientists need it for a study. I\u2019ve never understood\nthe idea of \u201cwork\u201d because I\u2019ve always followed the maxim: pursue projects I\nlove. So for me there is no separation between work and life, and the phrase\n\u201cwork-life balance\u201d is like a typo; it\u2019s semantically invalid. So it\u2019s natural\nfor me to merge with the project.\n\nJoe Betts-LaCroix at the Retro Biosciences lab in Redwood City, CA.\n\nBig Think: Recruitment can make (or break) companies. How have you positioned\nRetro\u2019s company culture to make sure you\u2019re successful in this regard?\n\nBetts-LaCroix: Extremely capable people love to build what matters, so the\nfirst criterion is to choose a mission that matters: a really challenging one.\nAnother is to give people room to run. Authoritarian cultures destroy\ncreativity. I trust people a lot. I have a positive view of human nature, and\nmostly that works well for me. Sometimes I\u2019m extremely disappointed, and\nexperience painful exceptions [to my default positivity], but they pass \u2014 and\nstatistically, they are indeed exceptions. Believing in people helps them\nbelieve in themselves.\n\nBig Think: Which leadership virtues will be the most effective and valuable in\nnavigating the decade of accelerating technologies that lies ahead of us?\n\nBetts-LaCroix: Valorizing rate of learning over amount of knowledge.\nInformation gets outmoded faster and faster, so to thrive in the coming times,\nwe must get really good at adapting and learning, not resting on our stale\nknowledge base of ten years ago. So I look for people to hire who\u2019ve mastered\nseveral new things over a short period of time, and promote people who learn\nquickly.\n\nBig Think: Is it time to rethink the accepted wisdom of tech leadership. Does\n\u201cmove fast and break things\u201d still hold as a practical mantra?\n\nBetts-LaCroix: Speed is everything. My job is to maximize the probability of\nmission success given limited resources. Slowness incurs costs: salaries,\nrent, and everyone\u2019s patience. Conversely, speed is inspiring. Progress\nenergizes us, and attracts even more talented team members, which further\nincreases progress, which drives acceleration.\n\nSubscribe for a weekly email\n\nRead More\n\nPeople confuse fast with sloppy, but we expect more of ourselves. On a two-\ndimensional chart of fast and accurate, I expect us to be in the upper right\nquadrant. Fast means knowing you are vastly ignorant and have the self-\nconfidence to find out why: Don\u2019t hesitate to devise a rapid experiment to see\nif your hypothesis is wrong. So yes, I think we should move fast and break\nignorance. I celebrate iteration. An experiment that disproves your hypothesis\nrapidly is considered a success here.\n\n> For me there is no separation between work and life, and the phrase \u201cwork-\n> life balance\u201d is like a typo; it\u2019s semantically invalid.\n\nBig Think: Over the course of your life and career so far, which leaders have\nyou most admired and why?\n\nBetts-LaCroix: When I was a kid, it was Buckminster \u201cBucky\u201d Fuller (whom I got\nto see lecture in Oregon) and Nikola Tesla. Later, I was in awe of my advisor\nat Harvard, because, not only was his mind a paradise to play in, but also it\nwas amazing how he remade his world: the prodigy sent out by his\nfundamentalist community to disprove this \u201cghastly theory\u201d of continental\ndrift, only to realize how beautifully true it was \u2014 then devote his life to\nbeing a world leader of elucidating other such truths.\n\nJory Bell, the co-founder of my first venture funded company, OQO, was\ninspiring to me because he taught me that I can have an aesthetic point of\nview about machines. I knew that dogwood trees in the spring, and K\u00e4the\nKollwitz paintings, were beautiful \u2014 not until meeting Jory did I appreciate\nthat some machines were also beautiful, especially when the focus is on their\nfunction, not on decoration. But I didn\u2019t really have any inspiring models\nafter that until I met Sam Altman, which was a long gap.\n\nBig Think: Altman\u2019s backing of Retro has caught the eye. How has his\ninvolvement inspired your leadership and vision?\n\nBetts-LaCroix: Sam has been a shockingly positive influence on me as a leader\nand on the company culture. At first I wondered, why is this Sam guy\nconcerning himself with the art of the startup so much? Then I realized that\nstartup is the lever that drives all inspiring change. I love learning to do\nhard things that enable exciting outcomes, and startup culture is the key: it\nbecame legitimately interesting and then intensely empowering once I realized\nit could (and should) be authentic, which means I can bring my whole self to\nthe task (including my body, lol). I don\u2019t get judgement from Sam, just\nconstructive ideas: \u201cHave you considered \u2018X\u2019? Here\u2019s a practice you could\ntry.\u201d There\u2019s zero learned helplessness.\n\nTags\n\nbiotechEmerging TechExecutive Presenceinnovationleadershipmedicineproblem\nsolving\n\nTopics\n\nThe Vision\n\nIn this article\n\nbiotechEmerging TechExecutive Presenceinnovationleadershipmedicineproblem\nsolving\n\n### Unlock potential in your business\n\nLearn how Big Think+ can empower your people.\n\nRequest a Demo\n\nRelated\n\nBusiness\n\n5 essential tools for a first-time CEO\n\nBoardroom veteran David Roche offers key strategies that can lay the\ngroundwork for CEO success.\n\nBusiness\n\nNormal has left the building: 5 ways leaders can handle volatility\n\nThe old certainties of \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d have been crushed by disruption \u2014\nhere\u2019s a strategy for resilience.\n\nBusiness\n\n6 \u201csecret sauce\u201d ingredients for empathetic leadership\n\nSam Smith \u2014 founder and former CEO of finnCap Group \u2014 argues that a culture of\nempathy will help superscale any business.\n\nHard Science\n\nWhere the little helicopter on Mars fits in the history of aviation\n\nIf the past is any guide, things are going to take off quickly.\n\nHealth\n\nNew study challenges long-held assumption about cancer\n\nCancers can\u2019t develop without genetic mutations \u2014 or can they?\n\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE\n\nRecommended by\n\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE\n\nRecommended by\n\n## Footer\n\nSubscribe\n\nGet counterintuitive, surprising, and impactful stories delivered to your\ninbox every Thursday.\n\nFollow Us\n\nView our Youtube channel\n\nView our Facebook page\n\nView our Instagram feed\n\nView our Twitter (X) feed\n\nView our LinkedIn account\n\nSections\n\n  * Neuropsych\n  * Thinking\n  * Leadership\n  * Smart Skills\n  * High Culture\n  * The Past\n  * The Present\n  * The Future\n  * Life\n  * Health\n  * Hard Science\n  * Special Issues\n  * Business\n\nColumns\n\n  * Starts With A Bang\n  * The Well\n  * Perception Box\n  * 13.8\n  * Strange Maps\n  * The Learning Curve\n  * Everyday Philosophy\n\nVideo\n\n  * The Big Think Interview\n  * Your Brain on Money\n  * Playlists\n  * Explore the Library\n\nAbout\n\n  * Our Mission\n  * Work With Us\n  * Contact\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Accessibility\n  * Careers\n\nSubscribe\n\n  * Free Newsletters\n  * Memberships\n\n  * The Weekly Crossword\n\nGet Big Think for Your Business.
