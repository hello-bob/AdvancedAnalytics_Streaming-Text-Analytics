The move could improve the bill\u2019s chances in\nthe Senate, and President Joe Biden has indicated that he will sign the bill\nif it reaches his desk.\n\nThe bill would force ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, to\neither sell its American holdings to a U.S. company or face a ban in the\ncountry. The company has said it will fight any effort to force a sale.\n\nThe proposed legislation was motivated by a set of national security concerns.\nFor one, ByteDance can be required to assist the Chinese Communist Party in\ngathering intelligence, according to the Chinese National Intelligence Law. In\nother words, the data TikTok collects can, in theory, be used by the Chinese\ngovernment.\n\nFurthermore, TikTok\u2019s popularity in the United States, and the fact that many\nyoung people get their news from the platform \u2013 one-third of Americans under\nthe age of 30 \u2013 turns it into a potent instrument for Chinese political\ninfluence.\n\nIndeed, the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence recently\nclaimed that TikTok accounts run by a Chinese propaganda arm of the government\ntargeted candidates from both political parties during the U.S. midterm\nelection cycle in 2022, and the Chinese Communist Party might attempt to\ninfluence the U.S. elections in 2024 in order to sideline critics of China and\nmagnify U.S. social divisions.\n\nTo these worries, proponents of the legislation have appended two more\narguments: It\u2019s only right to curtail TikTok because China bans most\nU.S.-based social media networks from operating there, and there would be\nnothing new in such a ban, since the U.S. already restricts the foreign\nownership of important media networks.\n\nSome of these arguments are stronger than others.\n\nChina doesn\u2019t need TikTok to collect data about Americans. The Chinese\ngovernment can buy all the data it wants from data brokers because the U.S.\nhas no federal data privacy laws to speak of. The fact that China, a country\nthat Americans criticize for its authoritarian practices, bans social media\nplatforms is hardly a reason for the U.S. to do the same.\n\nThe debate about banning TikTok tends to miss the larger picture of social\nmedia literacy.\n\nI believe the cumulative force of these claims is substantial and the\nlegislation, on balance, is plausible. But banning the app is also a red\nherring.\n\nIn the past few years, my colleagues and I at UMass Boston\u2019s Applied Ethics\nCenter have been studying the impact of AI systems on how people understand\nthemselves. Here\u2019s why I think the recent move against TikTok misses the\nlarger point: Americans\u2019 sources of information have declined in quality and\nthe problem goes beyond any one social media platform.\n\n## The deeper problem\n\nPerhaps the most compelling argument for banning TikTok is that the app\u2019s\nubiquity and the fact that so many young Americans get their news from it\nturns it into an effective tool for political influence. But the proposed\nsolution of switching to American ownership of the app ignores an even more\nfundamental threat.\n\nThe deeper problem is not that the Chinese government can easily manipulate\ncontent on the app. It is, rather, that people think it is OK to get their\nnews from social media in the first place. In other words, the real national\nsecurity vulnerability is that people have acquiesced to informing themselves\nthrough social media.\n\nSocial media is not made to inform people. It is designed to capture consumer\nattention for the sake of advertisers. With slight variations, that\u2019s the\nbusiness model of all platforms. That\u2019s why a lot of the content people\nencounter on social media is violent, divisive and disturbing. Controversial\nposts that generate strong feelings literally capture users\u2019 notice, hold\ntheir gaze for longer, and provide advertisers with improved opportunities to\nmonetize engagement.\n\nThere\u2019s an important difference between actively consuming serious, well-\nvetted information and being manipulated to spend as much time as possible on\na platform. The former is the lifeblood of democratic citizenship because\nbeing a citizen who participates in political decision-making requires having\nreliable information on the issues of the day. The latter amounts to letting\nyour attention get hijacked for someone else\u2019s financial gain.\n\nIf TikTok is banned, many of its users are likely to migrate to Instagram and\nYouTube. This would benefit Meta and Google, their parent companies, but it\nwouldn\u2019t benefit national security. People would still be exposed to as much\njunk news as before, and experience shows that these social media platforms\ncould be vulnerable to manipulation as well. After all, the Russians primarily\nused Facebook and Twitter to meddle in the 2016 election.\n\nMedia literacy is especially critical in the age of social media.\n\n## Media and technology literacy\n\nThat Americans have settled on getting their information from outlets that are\nuninterested in informing them undermines the very requirement of serious\npolitical participation, namely educated decision-making. This problem is not\ngoing to be solved by restricting access to foreign apps.\n\nResearch suggests that it will only be alleviated by inculcating media and\ntechnology literacy habits from an early age. This involves teaching young\npeople how social media companies make money, how algorithms shape what they\nsee on their phones, and how different types of content affect them\npsychologically.\n\nMy colleagues and I have just launched a pilot program to boost digital media\nliteracy with the Boston Mayor\u2019s Youth Council. We are talking to Boston\u2019s\nyouth leaders about how the technologies they use everyday undermine their\nprivacy, about the role of algorithms in shaping everything from their taste\nin music to their political sympathies, and about how generative AI is going\nto influence their ability to think and write clearly and even who they count\nas friends.\n\nWe are planning to present them with evidence about the adverse effects of\nexcessive social media use on their mental health. We are going to talk to\nthem about taking time away from their phones and developing a healthy\nskepticism towards what they see on social media.\n\nProtecting people\u2019s capacity for critical thinking is a challenge that calls\nfor bipartisan attention. Some of these measures to boost media and technology\nliteracy might not be popular among tech users and tech companies. But I\nbelieve they are necessary for raising thoughtful citizens rather than passive\nsocial media consumers who have surrendered their attention to commercial and\npolitical actors who do not have their interests at heart.\n\n  * Social media\n  * China\n  * Technology\n  * US Congress\n  * Data privacy\n  * US-China relations\n  * Misinformation\n  * Media literacy\n  * TikTok\n\n### Events\n\nMore events\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * ##### Sydney Horizon Educators (Identified)\n\n  * ##### Senior Disability Services Advisor\n\n  * ##### Deputy Social Media Producer\n\n  * ##### Associate Professor, Occupational Therapy\n\n  * ##### GRAINS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION CHAIRPERSON\n\nMore jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n\n", "frontpage": false}
