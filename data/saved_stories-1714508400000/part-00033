In biology, a\nchimera is any organism made up of cells with different sets of genes. Now\nresearchers have created a unique variety of chimeras in the form of mice with\nrat neurons that replace lost brain functions. The chimeric mice highlight the\nadaptability of the brain and raise hopes for studying neurological disease\nand for developing brain tissues that more closely resemble those of humans\nfor transplantation.\n\nThe findings, reported in two studies in Cell this week, show that rat neurons\ncan integrate into mouse brains and develop into missing circuits using a\nprocedure called interspecies blastocyst complementation (IBC) in which\nresearchers inject cells from one species into embryos of another and then\nimplant the embryos into animals of their own species. Researchers had\npreviously used this technique to develop a pancreas and kidneys in mice and\nrats but not brain tissue.\n\nThe new work is \u201ca big step in the field,\u201d says Andrew Crane, a cell biologist\nat the University of Minnesota, who was not involved with the two papers.\n\u201cBoth of these studies are answering key questions about how rat cells develop\nwithin a mouse.\u201d\n\nOne of the studies, conducted by Jun Wu of University of Texas Southwestern\nMedical Center and his colleagues, first sought to identify which genes the\nresearchers needed to excise in order to block the development of specific\nbrain areas. The team used the gene-editing technique CRISPR to quickly create\nmice without important genes needed for the animals\u2019 development and found\nthat knocking out the gene Hesx1 resulted in mice that lacked an area called\nthe forebrain, which is mostly involved in complex cognitive and sensory\nprocessing. A void remained in the brains where the forebrains should have\nbeen.\n\nThen the researchers performed IBC by injecting rat stem cells into host\nembryos of these genetically altered mice to see how they developed. The rat\ncells matured with the embryos, integrating with the host cells and creating\nthe missing forebrains. The rat cells were capable of sending signals to other\nneurons when researchers activated them. Although the team also used mouse\ncells to restore the forebrains, the goal was to see if rat cells could do the\nsame, opening the possibility of combining cell from different animals to\ncreate brain tissues. The study is a \u201ctechnological tour de force,\u201d says\nWalter Low, neuroscientist at the University of Minnesota, who was not\ninvolved with the research.\n\nIn parallel, Kristin Baldwin, a neuroscientist at Columbia University Irving\nMedical Center, and her colleagues used the same approach to examine how rat\ncells would populate a mouse brain. (Wu was also a co-author of this study.)\nIn mouse embryos, they injected rat cells that also created functional\nconnections.\n\nNot only could the rat cells integrate into the mouse brains, but they also\nrestored missing functions in mice that lacked the sensory neurons for smell.\nWithout the sense that they use to look for food, the anosmic mice failed to\nfind mini Oreo cookies buried in their bedding. But such mice without\nolfactory neurons that were injected with rat stem cells burrowed into the\nbedding to locate the cookies, showing that the donor neurons rescued smell\nand initiated food-seeking behavior. The mice effectively \u201cperceived the world\nthrough the other species\u2019 nose,\u201d Baldwin says.\n\n## Related Stories\n\n  * ### Soviet-Era Pseudoscience Lurks behind \u2018Havana Syndrome\u2019 Worries\n\nKeith Kloor\n\n  * ### Human Brains May Be Getting Bigger\n\nDiana Kwon\n\n  * ### Hollywood Should Give Brain Science a Star Turn\n\nDeena Weisberg & Marc Coutanche\n\n  * ### Scientists Discover Extensive Brain-Wave Patterns\n\nSimon Makin\n\nThese studies provide key insights into developmental biology, Low points out.\nEven though rats typically develop more slowly than mice and rat brains are\nlarger, rat cells timed their development to the pace of cells in their mouse\nhost, taking cues from their environment to grow alongside their neuronal\ncounterparts and mature to the appropriate size.\n\nBut not all of growth and development was dictated by the host: when Wu\u2019s team\nlooks at the genes expressed by the cells, they still retained their genetic\nidentity. \u201cThere's really intriguing cross talk between extrinsic and\nintrinsic factors,\u201d he says. These chimeras could further help scientists to\nstudy the plasticity of the brain and what critical factors dictate\ndevelopment.\n\nThe IBC technique might help researchers develop improved brains tissue for\nresearch and, in the long run, transplantation. If this works in animals like\nnon-human primates, the technology could complement animal models of\nneurological disease, says Bjoern Schwer, molecular biologist at the\nUniversity of California, San Francisco who was not involved with the study.\n\nThese papers reveal critical factors for perfecting the technique, revealing\nthe steps needed to synchronize the growth and development of the different\ncell types. \u201cIt\u2019s that synchronization [of the mice and rat cells] that\nallowed them to integrate beautifully within the brain of the mouse,\u201d Low\nsays. \u201cIn the future, if we want to make human organs in a large animal like a\npig, we need to synchronize cells\u2019 development so that the cells match one\nanother during the developmental process\u201d.\n\nIn their research, Wu and his colleagues observed one possible hitch: as the\nembryos developed, the contribution of the cells, meaning what percentage of\nthe donor cells were in the forebrain, started dwindling from about 100\npercent to 60 percent, suggesting that mouse cells could be outcompeting the\ndonor cells. This lack of control over how many cells were integrated into the\nembryo and eventually survived led some of the chimeric mice to have more rat\nneurons in their brain than others. Because of this, \u201ceach animal is\ndifferent,\u201d Baldwin says.\n\nAnd ultimately, rat and mice genomes are very similar to one another but the\ntechnology could become more challenging if species more distantly related\nthan mice and rats are used to make chimeras, as differences in brain\nphysiology and the likelihood of immune reactions increase. Ethical issues\nalso arise when creating a chimera. There are concerns as to whether donor\ncells from a rat or another species might affect the behavior and cognition in\nthe host animal. \u201cWhat would it mean if somebody tried to put human cells into\na pig embryo [to develop a brain]?\u201d Crane wonders.\n\nThe next steps are to refine these techniques and do chimera experiments in\nlarger animals such as pigs to address these questions,Low says. Starting\nthese studies will begin to reveal \u201cthe other variables that we\u2019ll need to\novercome in order to make growing human organs that we can transplant a\nreality\u201d.\n\nRights & Permissions\n\nAbout Claudia Lopez Lloreda\n\nClaudia Lopez-Lloreda is a freelance science writer and neuroscience graduate\nstudent at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nMore by Claudia Lopez Lloreda\n\n# Popular Stories\n\nAnimals April 25, 2024\n\n##\n\nWe Are in the Golden Age of Bird-Watching\n\nThere has never been a better time to be or become a birder\n\nKate Wong\n\nAstrophysics April 26, 2024\n\n##\n\nThe Threat of a Solar Superstorm Is Growing\u2014And We\u2019re Not Ready\n\nSomeday an unlucky outburst from our sun could strike Earth and fry most of\nour electronics\u2014and we\u2019ve already had some too-close-for-comfort near misses\n\nPhil Plait\n\nOpinion January 3, 2024\n\n##\n\nStop Asking If the Universe Is a Computer Simulation\n\nWe will never know if we live in a computer simulation; here is a more\ninteresting question\n\nSimon Duan\n\nAgriculture April 26, 2024\n\n##\n\nBird Flu Is Spreading in Cows.
