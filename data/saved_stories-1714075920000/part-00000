But, being a wannabe\npublic intellectual, after a few weeks, I did what any half-decent\nintellectual would... I started writing about it. The piece I wrote, I\nconsidered at first too incendiary to publish. When friends and colleagues\npersuaded me to go ahead, saying that this was the kind of authentic writing\nthey\u2019d never encountered from me before, I was unwilling to do so under my own\nname. At length, for the first time ever, I published under a pseudonym. After\nremarkably supportive feedback, I started giving talks with the title \u2018This\nCivilisation Is Finished\u2019. It seemed that people loved the breath of fresh\nair: someone was calling it.\n\nBut there was still something missing. I didn\u2019t have a plan. I could see no\nway for humanity to avoid collapse without rapidly transforming this\ncivilisation into something very different. So what do you actually do about\nthat?\n\nDuring the three years after my epiphany, I had found that my words on the\ntopic were achieving some resonance. Yet, lacking anything much like a plan, I\nstill felt directionless, unsatisfied, even at times nearly hopeless. That all\nchanged when I heard about an embryonic organisation that was seeking to gear\nup to launch: Extinction Rebellion (XR). Their analysis was similar to mine;\nsome of their leaders had heard or read some of my stuff. But there was one\nbig difference: they had a plan.\n\nI threw myself into XR. Helped them launch. Became a strategist and\nspokesperson, as well as running their political liaison efforts. After the\nsuccessful April 2019 rebellion forced a national conversation, I was part of\nthe team that met with Michael Gove, then environment secretary, and other\nmembers of the UK\u2019s Conservative government. Through May 2019, the plan had\nworked.\n\nXR accomplished something extraordinary, unprecedented. I\u2019ll never regret\nbeing part of that. Finding XR, after finding my own voice, was finding a\nlife\u2019s purpose.\n\nThe Canning Town debacle planted the seed in my mind and that of a number of\nothers that perhaps XR was not capable of being the vehicle for mass-\nparticipatory change. It started a process of reassessment. By September 2020,\nlike a number of others who had played significant roles in XR, I felt it was\ntime to move on. It seemed that XR had likely achieved most of what it was\ncapable of: a major uptick in climate consciousness; finally cutting through\nclimate denial in the name of a renewed moral seriousness. Over the next year,\nI entered a new phase of thought. Asking how to name the emergence, already\nunderway, of a much wider and larger, more \u2018moderate\u2019 more-than-movement, to\nrise to the challenge of the escalating more-than-emergency.\n\nParticipation in and positive impact of XR reached a ceiling in October 2019.\nThis was partly because XR hit a self-imposed landmine in the infamous Canning\nTown action, which involved a small, extreme group of activists making the\nincomprehensible choice to target an underground commuter train in a low-\nincome area of London for nonviolent direct action. XR had transformed climate\nconsciousness in the UK and, with the aid of the school climate strikers, in\nmuch of the world. But it had not succeeded in changing policy. And now\nperhaps it never would.\n\nMalm holds that the gravity of the situation requires property damage, such as\nsevering oil pipelines\n\nSo the question re-arose: what would, what should be the plan, under these\ncircumstances? Throughout the period of and in which I am writing, the level\nof peril the world faces has steadily risen. When XR launched, we called for\nrich countries like the UK to go carbon zero in an emergency programme of\nchange by 2025. On such a short timeline, every passing year is a big\nincrement, putting such goals ever further out of reach. Now in 2024,\nrecordbreaking escalation in temperature places us firmly outside our self-\ndeclared \u2018safe\u2019 zone; and, obviously, achieving carbon zero by 2025 is\ncompletely impossible. And I argue that staying below 1.5\u00b0C of global over-\nheat is plainly impossible too. Until that awareness sinks in and rocket-fuels\nus, we\u2019ll never stop the rot.\n\nAs a citizen waking up to this terrible truth, as the situation becomes more\nand more desperate, does the obligation to take desperate measures \u2013 in terms\nof the tactics we\u2019re prepared to undertake, not just the policies we\u2019re\nlooking to bring about \u2013 increase? That can seem very intuitive. XR thought\nso. Insulate Britain agreed \u2013 as did Just Stop Oil (JSO): these smaller\norganisations were formed explicitly as radical flanks to XR. Some, notably\nthe Swedish ecologist Andreas Malm, take the matter further still, into\n\u2018ecotage\u2019: Malm holds that the gravity of the situation requires substantial\nproperty damage, such as severing oil pipelines. I have debated the merits and\notherwise of such an approach directly with him; I shan\u2019t discuss it further\nhere, but will instead focus on whether large-scale nonviolent civil\ndisobedience of the XR and JSO kind is obligated upon us by the escalating\ncrisis.\n\nThe classic philosophical debate around civil disobedience (or nonviolent\ndirect action) asks: is there a right to engage in this form of conscientious\nlaw-breaking, under circumstances of deep wrong, where conventional methods of\naddressing that wrong have failed or are unavailable? It\u2019s widely accepted\namong philosophers that there is such a right: it is virtually unknown for\nphilosophers to argue against it; even an extremely mainstream liberal\nindividualist such as John Rawls argues for it. And the climate crisis fits\nthe bill for the exercise of this right. Because it is a case of a huge and\nurgent injustice \u2013 a threat to the very viability of ongoing human\ncivilisation, an existential risk \u2013 where conventional methods have been tried\nand failed, and moreover where vulnerable unborn future generations are not\nable to stick up (let alone vote) for themselves to try to redress the matter.\n\nSo there is no need to rehearse that debate. It is basically settled: there is\na right to engage in civil disobedience in our current extreme circumstances.\nThat, however, does not settle the matter of whether one should engage in such\norganised disobedience.\n\nFor there is a more interesting, more timely debate emerging in recent years:\nare there circumstances and contexts in which (every)one has an obligation to\nparticipate in civil disobedience? This question goes far beyond the \u2018Is it\nacceptable?\u2019 debate. Former colleagues of mine in XR (now in Just Stop Oil)\nsometimes argue passionately that we are in precisely such a condition: that\nyou, reader, are morally obligated to join them. I want to consider that case.\n\nI perceive two inseparable elements to the standard case for an obligation to\nparticipate in nonviolent civil disobedience, or (as it is often called)\n\u2018civil resistance\u2019: moral and pragmatic. The moral element says that this is\nsimply the right thing to do \u2013 to be \u2018on the right side of history\u2019, whatever\nthe consequences; and to signal one\u2019s \u2018solidarity\u2019 with those worst affected;\nwith the younger generation; with unborn future generations. In technical\nterms, following the great moral philosopher Immanuel Kant: what is to be done\nis allegedly deontologically or intrinsically determinable. It is allegedly a\nuniversal obligation to seek to head off an unprecedented catastrophe, by any\nacceptable (usually, nonviolent) means necessary. The idea is that, with the\nconventional political process having failed to put us on the path to a future\nindicated by science, precaution and ethics, we are obliged to take matters\ninto our own hands by stepping outside the law in order to \u2018just stop oil\u2019.\n\nThe first thing to say about any alleged solidaristic obligatory moral case\nfor backing the radical flank is that now, in countries like the UK, it is\nhard to square with what young people actually want. Consider the 2023 YouGov\npoll asking the public their opinion of JSO, the campaign group behind the\nnow-dominant form of \u2018civil resistance\u2019 in the UK. Only 17 per cent of adults\nhave some kind of positive opinion of what JSO are doing. Among 18- to\n24-year-olds, the figure is higher but not much: 21 per cent have a positive\nview. Across all ages, hugely larger percentages have a negative view: 10\ntimes as many have a \u2018very unfavourable\u2019 view as have a \u2018very favourable\u2019 view\nof JSO. Among young people, the ratio is \u2018only\u2019 four times as many.\n\nBecause a small minority of young people rather than a tiny one (of older\npeople) supports Just Stop Oil plainly does not mean you can show solidarity\nwith the demographic by supporting JSO.\n\nMaking a hoped-for outcome probable is a minimum threshold for a collective\nendeavour to make sense\n\nBut, regardless of what young people happen to want, it might be argued that\nit\u2019s simply the right thing to do to undertake civil resistance on their part.\nPaternalistic, perhaps, but still right, possibly. Nevertheless, any such case\nwill be very weak by itself. To be convincing, it needs coupling with the\npragmatic case: that the action undertaken is likely to actually be the best\navailable way to bring about the desired outcome that will protect young\npeople. And this has been widely understood: the standard pragmatic case for\ncivil resistance, based on social movement theory and indeed history, is that\nit is simply the most effective way to bring about transformative change.\n\nThe weakness of a moral case alone to support an obligation to nonviolent\ndirect action is therefore clear. Outside a relatively narrow category of\nintrinsically right or wrong actions, we commonly identify the morality of\nactions \u2013 especially, any costly and strenuous actions in the public sphere \u2013\nwith a hoped-for outcome. Or at least: making a hoped-for outcome probable is\na minimum threshold for a collective endeavour to make sense.\n\nConsider the person who chooses, on a \u2018purely\u2019 moral basis, what they admit is\nlikely the less effective of two possible actions to change climate policy.\nThe logical response of a young person is surely to reject the \u2018morality\u2019 of\nthis action: Damn your \u2018solidarity\u2019; I want a future! So kindly do what is\neffective.\n\nAny philosophical assessment of an alleged obligation to undertake nonviolent\ndirect action that hopes to be relevant to the real world must therefore\nconsider likely consequences. It cannot avoid assessing whether there may be a\nmore effective alternative course of action.\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong. I am not offering a simple get-out clause. Not at all.\nI do hold that we \u2013 each and every human not fast asleep \u2013 are obliged to take\naction on this existential crisis. Let me explain.\n\nWhen we are failed by our leaders, when the system fails, this does not\nabsolve us from responsibility. On the contrary. Everything is now at stake.\nIf you care about anything at all, then ipso facto, whether you know it or\nnot, you care about the climate crisis. For we are on track to have it sweep\naway all that we hold dear. If you care about the arts, or about disability\nrights, or about your own children, then you care about this: for they will\nall, on a default setting, get swept away by the \u2018white swan\u2019 threat of\nclimate meltdown. So you must, at minimum, consider what you can do to change\nthis situation, to avert or cope with this mother-of-all-threats hanging over\nus now. To put the matter in terms that the existentialists would have\nunderstood: all your projects are mortally threatened by this existential\nthreat, this hyperthreat. So you must, among all your projects (and, in a\ncertain sense, prior to them), consider this project.\n\nYou are obliged to consider your position. You are obliged to discover what is\nyour most effective potential work to do, to contribute to there being a\nfuture.\n\nThe vast majority of \u2018doomism\u2019 turns out to be grasping for a reprieve from\nhaving to act, from committing\n\nFeeling small and relatively powerless does not absolve you. So long as you\nhave any power or voice whatsoever, you are obliged to use it (and grow it).\nYou are not absolved by speculating that we might be doomed. You don\u2019t know\nthat we are and, until you do, such speculations are beside the point.\n(Doomism is a prime instance of the undue \u2018knowingness\u2019 characteristic of our\nflawed civilisational model: the tendency to assume that we know something\nthat is, in fact, imponderable.) Similarly, you are not absolved by wondering\nif it is perhaps \u2018too late\u2019. This widespread phrase is tellingly vague. One\nshould always ask in response: Too late for what? Yes, it is way too late for\na smooth \u2018net zero\u2019 transition, or for us to be able to stay in the climatic\n\u2018safe\u2019 zone. It is too late, as I set out earlier, for this civilisation to\ncontinue to exist! But it is not too late to co-create a new one (or at least:\nyou do not know that it is); it is not too late to transform and adapt; and it\nis never too late to seek do the right thing in the place you find yourself.\n\nThe vast majority of \u2018doomism\u2019 turns out to be what Jean-Paul Sartre called\nthe grasping for a reprieve. A reprieve from having to act, a reprieve from\ncommitting. Those who reached for the excuse, during the Second World War, in\n(say) occupied France, that there was nothing they could do, that resistance\nwas futile, that they were only obeying orders, we now judge to have been in\nbad faith, or at least to have been seriously mistaken. A similar judgment\nwaits to hang over those who are primarily motivated to find excuses not to\nact in the face of the climate more-than-emergency (which threatens to end up\nkilling far more than Hitler did). Our children will reject such excuses, and\nthey will, where appropriate, make such judgments.\n\nI suggest therefore that everyone under the current unprecedented\ncircumstances (of a collectively imposed existential \u2018hyperthreat\u2019 that is\nmore or less tractable, but that conventional methods have largely failed to\naffect) is indeed obliged to act in a serious manner to deal with that threat.\nWe are obliged by our situation to try to change our direction of travel,\ntogether: in simple terms, to change the world. But I pull back from the\nconclusion that we are obliged to undertake \u2018civil resistance\u2019, for the simple\nbut crucial reason that our obligation must be understood as an obligation to\nundertake the most effective intervention possible in our circumstances. No\nobligation to engage in civil resistance exists where there is good reason to\nbelieve that other available interventions are more effective.\n\nLet me now take a moment to consider a specific case where I think this good\nreason is visible. It\u2019s the case I know best: my own country. \u2018Civil\nresistance\u2019 in the UK has met the limits of its effectiveness since 2019 and\nis now merely symbolic. The actions of Insulate Britain (IB), primarily\nblocking motorways, were very probably (and predictably) counterproductive.\nThat is why IB has disappeared. Just Stop Oil, learning from IB\u2019s mistakes,\ndid not necessarily start out that way, but is now very much suffering from\nthe law of diminishing returns, with citizens growing tired of attention-\ngrabbing and disruption to the general public. With the UK government bringing\nin repressive laws that are, tragically, popular, JSO has surely become\ncounterproductive too. This view is widely held in the environmental movement\nnow, as well as beyond it. (It is not often stated, for reasons of\n\u2018solidarity\u2019.)\n\nJSO has lost the war. It has not stopped oil; instead, the UK government\ndoubled down on oil production; moreover, the Labour Party has said it will\nnot undo new fossil fuel licences being issued en masse by the Conservative\ngovernment.\n\nNot only has XR changed its strategy, as of December 2022, and moved away from\npublic disruption, recognising it as counterproductive, but, this January,\neven Roger Hallam, XR\u2019s co-founder and the doyen of the \u2018more radical than\nthou\u2019 flank, made a startling admission: \u2018We were pushing up against a boulder\ncalled \u201cthe carbon regime\u201d. Now, like Sisyphus, I see that we were doomed to\nwatch it roll back in our faces.\u2019\n\nSo even he now allows for something like the mass, serious, moderate action\nthat I am advocating for here.\n\nWhat\u2019s needed is depolarisation (whereas civil resistance inevitably\npolarises)\n\nIf one goes back to social movement theory and examines the pragmatic case for\nnonviolent civil resistance, one finds that it is typically made against\nviolent resistance. Very good. But it virtually never considers the\npotentially viable alternative of a concerted programme of lawful moderate\naction at scale. In particular, whether such a programme may be doubly\neffective after some partly successful nonviolent direct action has been\nundertaken to force a national conversation. This is precisely the situation\nthat the UK (and some other countries) have been in since 2019. With XR and\nFridays For Future having succeeded in raising the alarm in 2019, the door is\nfinally open for something that has never happened before: a more-or-less-\nconcerted and yet distributed, truly mass, mainstream, climate more-than-\nmovement.\n\nThe intuitive argument that \u2018Desperate times require desperate tactical\nmeasures\u2019 is therefore, I now believe, invalid. The truth may well be the\nopposite, paradoxical though it might sound. In times when the weather is our\ngreatest recruiter, and when evermore people are looking for ways to come on\nboard, what\u2019s needed is the opposite of seeking to be more \u2018radical\u2019 than\nthou. What\u2019s needed is mainstreaming of climate action (without losing any\nfocus on the difficult, terrible truth of our climate predicament). What\u2019s\nneeded is depolarisation (whereas civil resistance inevitably polarises).\nWhat\u2019s needed is to be genuinely welcoming to the majority, who are sidling\ntowards coming on board, but who will be easily put off if they\u2019re made to\nfeel insufficiently righteous or \u2018radical\u2019. What we don\u2019t need is a false\nsense of moral obligation to undertake civil resistance, whether or not it is\nlikely to work. No: we need ways to figure out together the (effective) work\nthat is ours to do \u2013 and do it.\n\nWhat this looks like will vary, depending on exactly what are your passions,\ntalents, capacity. There is something for everyone to do in the great work\nbefore us; but there is no \u2018wholesale\u2019 answer to the question of what it\nconsists of. The question needs tackling person by person \u2013 which is not the\nsame as making it a matter of individualist action. There is, for sure, no\nnon-collectivist way of adequately tackling our condition; but our tasks will\nvary as much as our talents, experiences and resources.\n\nHowever, any reader breathing a sigh of relief at this conclusion \u2013 which\nmight seem to let us \u2018off the hook\u2019 in relation to (allegedly) having to break\nthe law \u2013 should not bask too long in the feeling. The obligation remains upon\nus all to do what is most effective, within the totality of our powers, along\nwith others, to help bring about profound change. And for the vast majority of\npeople this means not necessarily becoming an \u2018activist\u2019 but becoming\ncollectively active in ways that will alter their priorities substantively and\nsubstantially. Nothing less will allow us to look our children in the eye, and\nanswer the only question that, sooner or later, they will ask: What did you\ndo, once you knew?\n\nYou probably have to change your life.\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t mean that you have to give up flying or eat less meat. By all\nmeans, do these things, and they will help a little bit (I\u2019ve done both,\nthough as much to avoid tiresome criticism that distracts from my voice being\nheard without tiresome accusations of \u2018Hypocrite!\u2019, as for their own sake).\nAlas, I mean something much weightier than that. You need to reassess what you\nare actually doing with your life as a whole. Because what you do needs to\nscale, or to replicate or be replicable, or at least to cause a win in some\nzone that matters. It needs, in short, to help add up to something system-\ntransformative. To be part of co-creating that new civilisation.\n\nThe Climate Majority Project that I co-founded after leaving XR asks everyone\nto consider a question: what is your work to do? How can you be most effective\nin the shared struggle for a future? If you are rich, it is probably by\nthrowing your money into the ring (and thus, in due course, becoming not-\nrich). If you are a lawyer, there are multiple ways you can parlay your skill\ninto the cause. If you are in business, the raft of things that you ought to\ndo starts with lobbying hard for government more effectively to regulate the\nbusiness world, to reward ecologically sound behaviour and end the race-to-\nthe-bottom that competitive markets otherwise create. For many people, the\nwork will be to get seriously involved in climate-preparedness, in resilience-\nbuilding in your community, as best you can. The beauty of such preparedness-\nbuilding is not only its practical value, but its tendency to wake up others\nto the crisis.\n\nIt may well be that the most effective thing you need to do right now is stop,\nand really think and feel it\n\nFor teachers and academics, it is about teaching and researching the crisis,\nand communicating it lovingly and truthfully, supportively and efficaciously.\nFor creatives, the way forward is somewhat similar: put your talents into\nhelping imagine how we can get through this. Until we can see a path through\nwhat is coming, we are unlikely to get serious enough about building it. For\nthose in politics and policy, or in the media, it doesn\u2019t take much\nimagination to see how you might actually respond courageously and effectually\nto the crisis, and lead on it. For advertisers and people in PR, it\u2019s about\nputting your \u2018dark arts\u2019 into the service of bringing about some light at the\nend of the tunnel.\n\nFor anyone unsure of how best to contribute to the struggle for a future, it\nmay well be that the most effective thing you need to do right now is stop,\nreally think and feel it, talk it through, and thus spend some time figuring\nout your best role. Especially (though not only) if you are a young person, it\nmay well be that the most effective thing you can do right now is to seek out\na few people who are modelling leadership on the crisis, people who you think\nare acting particularly effectively, and volunteer your services to them; I\nmean, figure out how they could use some volunteer assistance, and how you\ncould provide it to them in your free time. The huge advantage of this course\nof action is that you will gain some mentoring, which is often the most\neffective way of figuring out what your own best contribution can be, longer\nterm.\n\nThere\u2019s something for everyone under the #climatemajority banner. For some,\nthe change will be extremely drastic: if you\u2019re are an oil exec, then your\nbest options include defecting, or becoming a double agent or a whistleblower.\nFor many, \u2018changing your life\u2019 will look surprisingly like continuing to do\nwhat you do \u2013 only doing it differently. Using your talents, your resources,\nprobably your position, to the maximum effect, in the shared cause.\n\nWe now have a fully shared and fully personal (again, one might call it\n\u2018existential\u2019) obligation to act on behalf of life.\n\nYou have to mean it.\n\nReturning finally to me. I\u2019ve quit academia, something I never quite did\nduring my XR years, to focus full-time on building, supporting and deepening\nthe climate majority. I am deeper embedded than ever in my life\u2019s purpose. I\nfeel more directionful than I can say. It\u2019s great (or it would be, if the\ncause wasn\u2019t that the world is burning).\n\nI\u2019ve gone all-in, even more than XR pulled me in. I\u2019m feeling fully and\nfertilely the obligation to act on the side of life.\n\nAnd so must we all, at a time like this. That has been my argument. There is a\nplace for everyone, in the climate majority. But you must find (or make) that\nplace. And enter it. Fully.\n\nMy own story might serve you, perhaps: as one example of how someone can\nchange their life, heading deeper into what they do best, and living it.\n\nBecoming as maximally effective as we can be, in a mainstreamable manner, in a\nsituation where, unless many, many of us do that, then all civilisation will\nbe finished, is the only way to escape what some in the radical flank claim is\nyour obligation: to enter into civil resistance.\n\nIf you are thinking of undertaking disruptive action, please think it right\nthrough\n\nFor to be clear: I believe that not just conventional activism but determined\nnonviolent direct action, up to and including ecotage (that takes care not to\nharm living beings), is likely the most effective way for some people to act.\nI still think it was the right thing to rebel back in 2018-19. And it is still\nthe right thing for some to do right now. For example, most of Scientist\nRebellion\u2019s feisty and formidable, ongoing, nonviolent, carefully targeted\ncivil disobedience appears potentially effective, without backfiring, and\n(therefore) worthwhile. That is the key: assessing whether a course of action\nis smart, and maximally pragmatically effective \u2013 or not. (Putting themselves\non the line is generally effective for SR because of the respect in which\nscientists are held, and their direct relevance to the crisis: they are, after\nall, its principal diagnosers. Our society now needs prompting into concerted\naction more than we need endless further diagnosis. And scientists express\nthat point well by visibly and forcefully protesting!)\n\nBut first: do no harm. If you are thinking of undertaking disruptive action,\nplease think it right through.\n\nIf you are not thinking of undertaking disruptive action, that\u2019s absolutely\nfine... provided you are thinking actively of the changed form of your life\ngoing forward that is liable to be most effective of all. More effective, at\nminimum, than such disruption might be.\n\nThis is perhaps even the new ramifying categorical imperative, one that\nincludes a binding consequentialist consideration nested within it... Act in\nthe universal interest: of life, of a future. Act after thinking through the\nconsequences: so as to be effective in the universal interest. But do be sure\nto act. To the full.\n\nYou won\u2019t regret it.\n\nRupert Read\u2019s new book The Climate Majority Project (2024) is co-edited with\nRosie Bell and Liam Kavanagh.
