I explore why they\u2019re terrible, why you\u2019ve done it anyway, and\nwhat to do about it.\n\n## Why your contact form sucks\n\n### Your contact form is completely broken\n\nIt\u2019s remarkable how many contact forms are just straight-up broken. A\nWordPress upgrade here, a change to your CRM there, and your contact form\nsilently breaks.\n\nAt time of writing, B&Q\u2019s contact form just plainly doesn\u2019t work^1. I am\nfairly amazed that a retailer with revenues in the billions doesn\u2019t notice\nwritten queries have stopped coming in.\n\n(as a side note: your form should have better error messages. The error above\ngives the user no way out, given that trying again would not help)\n\nThis is not an isolated incident. I\u2019ve been stung by broken contact forms on\nall kinds of websites, from many other big and small organisations. AWS\u2019s\nabuse contact form has been broken for months. And here\u2019s a particularly\ngnarly example from Elastoplast, one of the largest plaster brands in the UK:\n\n### Your contact form is broken for some users\n\nAxa, an insurer with almost a trillion euros of assets under management,\noffers a contact form that looks like it\u2019s time travelled from the early\n2000s. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t seem like that time has made it work better:\nit incorrectly rejects some valid emails^2 and doesn\u2019t show all the relevant\nAxa products.\n\nVodafone, a major UK mobile network, has a form to report devices lost and\nstolen. However, their site is frequently unavailable for maintenance\novernight. I can\u2019t imagine how frustrating having a phone stolen, only to try\nto report it and be presented with this:\n\nFinally, a lot of contact forms do not meet basic web accessibility standards,\nmaking it hard for assistive technology users to properly complete them. For\nexample, Virgin Mobile\u2019s complaint page is nearly unnavigable by keyboard due\nto hiding any kind of selection indicators.\n\n### Your contact form takes ages to fill out\n\nI\u2019m not sure how it\u2019s been achieved, but the UK\u2019s Charity Commission\u2019s\ncomplaints form takes about 6-7 seconds to load every single page! It offers\nno indication of progress, and you have to get through 11 pages to complete\nit.\n\nAt this rate, you spend 75 seconds just waiting for pages in the form to load.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not including the time to answer the questions asked - or even\nprocessing some of them. Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll get to review each one carefully\nbecause none of them have autocomplete attributes set.\n\nYou\u2019ll also have to read through all the options in this monstrosity of a\ndropdown - which is helpfully not grouped or sorted in any coherent way:\n\n(Additionally, this question doesn\u2019t make sense to ask in the first place. The\ncomplaint is about a service by the Charity Commission, after answering \u2018No\u2019\nto the question \u2018Does your question or query relate to a specific registered\ncharity?\u2019)\n\n### Your contact form asks for irrelevant personal information\n\nNational Grid has contact and feedback forms.^3 I might want to give them some\nminor feedback like \u2018hey this link on your site is broken\u2019, however I then\nneed to figure out whether I really want to provide all my personal details to\ndo this - like my home address and phone number (or at least make up something\nthat looks plausible).\n\nI\u2019ve also seen some complaints forms asking for more sensitive data, like date\nof birth or copies of ID documents. Sometimes this is despite them not holding\nthis information in the first place, so they\u2019re not comparing it to what they\nhave on record as a security measure.^4\n\nYou do need to collect some contact details, but do you really need three\ndifferent contact methods to respond to some off-hand feedback? Other things\nyou probably don\u2019t actually need on a general contact form include title, job\nfunction, company size, and landline number.\n\nThis unnecessarily increases the risk of my data being stolen and used for\nidentity fraud. For less trustworthy organisations, this also directly\nincreases the chance I get spam - so I either don\u2019t submit the form, or make\nup data.\n\n### Your contact form is less useful for customers\n\nEmail allows customers to create drafts, schedule messages, and easily keep a\nrecord of what\u2019s been said. It also often integrates into their workflows more\neasily, for example the ability to snooze emails to chase up on them later.\n\nYour form likely doesn\u2019t have any of these features. In fact, even if it\u2019s\nfully working users often don\u2019t get any form of confirmation they can refer\nback to later, let alone a confirmation that contains all the details they\nsubmitted.\n\nI\u2019m not certain there is malicious intent behind it, but I have experienced\nseveral companies \u2018accidentally\u2019 losing form submissions, only to mysteriously\nfind them again once I pull up copies of the form I saved a screenshot of. If\nyou\u2019re forcing your customers to do this, you\u2019re doing it wrong.\n\n### Your contact form is wasting your resources\n\nIt takes time and energy to build and maintain a contact form properly. It\nalmost always gets routed to an email behind the scenes (or a system that\naccepts email), so skip the middleman and put up the email address!\n\nIt also can mean that customers contacting you can\u2019t remember what their\noriginal message was about. I\u2019ve experienced getting a response from an\norganisation and then having to ask them what the original query was about -\nhad this been an email in the first place this could have been avoided.\n\n### Your contact form is irritating in other ways\n\nThere are probably hundreds of ways you could set up your contact form to be\nmaximally irritating, and I can\u2019t cover them all here. I\u2019ll leave you with one\nfinal example that doesn\u2019t fit into the categories above though.\n\nSainsbury\u2019s has a contact form that forces you to navigate down a long options\ntree. Only to open a modal and ask you to select the topic again. They then\npresent the tiniest form window ever, which makes it near impossible to fill\nout:\n\n## Why you\u2019ve done this, and what to do instead\n\nBeyond just \u2018it\u2019s what we\u2019ve always done\u2019, there are a few reasons you might\nthink a contact form is a good idea. Here we\u2019ll go through some of them and\nwhat you might do instead.\n\n### To collect structured data that speeds up resolving problems\n\nYou might want to use a contact form to collect structured data, so it saves\nyou time processing requests. For example, making sure the customer provides\nthe right identifiers for you to find them on your systems quickly, or\nautomatically assigning queries to the right teams.\n\nThis can be okay in some circumstances. Amazon does this well: it shows you\nthe recent items you\u2019ve purchased and also allows you to completely self-serve\ncommon customer service workflows (like requesting a return) - while still\nallowing you to speak to a human fairly easily.\n\nHowever, unless you\u2019ve got an excellent customer service portal (you probably\ndon\u2019t), you should just stick with an email for general contact purposes.\n\nTo make sure you have the right details, just set up a sensible auto-reply.\nHere\u2019s a good example from GP at hand:^5\n\nNext, before automating assigning queries to the right teams, consider whether\nyou need to do this: I\u2019ve seen very small teams try to justify \u2018a contact form\nwill help us categorise emails\u2019 when they receive two emails a day, or they\nall go to the same person anyways.\n\nIf you really do need to automate assigning emails, take a look at platforms\nlike Zendesk and their AI systems - this kind of thing is exactly what LLMs\nthrive at (or often just regular expressions will get you far enough).\n\n### You want people to contact you, and think your form will lower the barrier\n\nEmpirically, this doesn\u2019t hold up. I previously thought this was true, but\nI\u2019ve since seen at 3 different organisations who\u2019ve made the switch that this\ndoesn\u2019t seem to be the case - i.e. they get the same number of genuine\ncontacts by listing an email as having a contact form. I\u2019d love to rigorously\nanalyse and publish the data on this to help convince others.\n\nOne category where this might not be true by default is for very \u2018low-effort\u2019\nfeedback forms. I think this can probably be mitigated by making it clear that\nyou\u2019re friendly and would be happy to receive informal emails.\n\nThe other category where I think this might be more likely to lower the\nbarrier is where people prefer to be anonymous. For example, someone who might\nnot be public about their sexual orientation might not want to have related\ncomments so easily linked back to them, but still want to give feedback on\nsome article. The UK Government website, GOV.UK, has a delightfully simple\nexample that works well for collecting anonymous feedback:\n\n### You\u2019re worried you\u2019ll get spam if you list an email online\n\nSurprisingly, not really. I found we often ended up getting less spam compared\nto WordPress forms - there might be something about it being easier to submit\nanonymous forms with rubbish, compared to actually sending emails with decent\nenough reputation to get past today's spam filters.\n\nIf you really worry about this, you can obfuscate your email from spam bots.\nBut I think this is usually wasted time given just how rare this kind of email\nspam is, and how good spam filters have gotten. Plus this risks you messing\nthis up and breaking something.\n\n### You want to manage messages as a team\n\nYou can do this with email! Hook up a shared mailbox, collaborative inbox, or\none of the many off-the-shelf customer service solutions like Zendesk, Zoho\nDesk, Freshdesk, Zammad, osTicket, or FreeScout to your email.\n\n### You think email isn\u2019t secure enough\n\nEmail used to be very insecure because it wasn\u2019t encrypted.^6 This meant that\npeople between mail servers could read the contents of messages.\n\nHowever, unless you\u2019ve done something weird with your email setup, it\u2019ll\nprobably be encrypted securely like 99% of other email traffic is in 2024.\n\nIn theory, your customer might be using an email provider that doesn\u2019t support\nencryption - which could lead them to sending something to you insecurely and\nputting them at risk. I think most organisations can accept this risk given\nhow rare this is, given that this is on the customer\u2019s end. For what it\u2019s\nworth, the UK\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre is happy to list a contact\nemail for themselves.\n\nAnother question to ask yourself if you don\u2019t list an email for this reason:\ndo you respond via email after people contact you?\n\n### You think email isn't accessible to assistive technology users\n\nI've heard the claim that you need a contact form to be compliant with some\ncommon accessibility standard - this is simply not true. If you don't beleive\nme, try and actually find this rule.^7\n\nListing an email is almost certainly easier to parse and understand than your\ncontact form.\n\n### You don't want people to fill in your form\n\nYeah - this is one I'm not really here to help you with.\n\nThere are some organisations that intentionally want their form to be\ndifficult to complete - perhaps it\u2019s a regulatory requirement that you don\u2019t\nreally want to comply with. If you\u2019re doing this, you should probably feel\nbad.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how intentional this is, but in this vein Meta (Facebook) makes\nit very difficult to contact them about data protection matters. Some\ncharities have already highlighted that Meta\u2019s forms seem to be particularly\ndifficult to find, and difficult to complete. My own experiences with this\nprocess have been complex and drawn out, having been referred to several\ndifferent broken forms.\n\nRegulators should be doing a better job ensuring they are setting the bar\nappropriately in these cases, in a way that rewards actors who are complying\nwith both the letter and spirit of laws or regulations.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nContact forms are hard to get right, and often just a worse experience for\neveryone involved. Go forth and remove your contact form and list your email\non your website now!\n\n## Footnotes\n\n  1. As in, it\u2019s impossible to submit from the website - the error appears when submitting. Inspecting the network requests suggests this error is because a \u2018title\u2019 property is missing: likely some mismatch between the backend and the frontend (there is no title field on the frontend). Yes, these problems happen in software development from time to time: but there\u2019s no need to incur this if email already \u2018just works\u2019. \u21a9\n\n  2. test+test@example.com, t\u00e9st@example.com and test@\u00e9xample.com are all valid emails as per RFC 6532, but are all rejected by this form \u21a9\n\n  3. As a fun side bonus, if you make a single mistake on this form it deletes everything and forces you to start from scratch. For example, if you format your phone number \u2018wrong\u2019, your entire message you typed up is wiped. \u21a9\n\n  4. I don't think people's birthdays should be a security measure, but unfortunately it seems to be the world we live in. I'll have to explore this in another rant. \u21a9\n\n  5. It could probably place this a bit more prominently by cutting some of the other stuff, but on the whole the message is fairly clear and not an unreasonable length. \u21a9\n\n  6. There are also other email security risks, such as email spoofing (solvable with DMARC!). But on the whole, the email security risk seems overblown (especially compared to 'crappy WordPress form' security risk). \u21a9\n\n  7. Further examples that would seem to suggest that this is not necessary is that the following organisations list an email to contact them: Equality and Human Rights Commission (the public body responsible for disability rights), Scope (a major disability equality charity) and AbilityNet (a charity building assistive technologies). \u21a9\n\n", "frontpage": true}
