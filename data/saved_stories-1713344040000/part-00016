Throughout the beta phase, Overture will\nbe collecting feedback from these evaluations as it moves towards a general\nrelease. While incremental changes are anticipated, Overture expects the data\nand schema to be substantially stable. Production releases are expected to\nbegin in the summer.\n\n\u201cOverture is delivering on its promise to build and deliver high-quality map\ndata to support mapping applications,\u201d said Marc Prioleau, executive director\nof Overture Maps Foundation. \u201cThis Beta release brings together multiple\nsources of open data, has been through several validation tests, is formatted\nin a new schema and has an entity reference system that allows attachment of\nother spatial data. This is a significant step forward for open map data by\ndelivering data that is ready to be used in applications. It also lays the\npath for future improvements and expansion of the dataset. Our member\ncompanies have already begun to use Overture and we look forward to many more\nusers and feedback so we can quickly get to production and deliver a\ncomprehensive, market-grade open map dataset.\u201d\n\nLeading Overture members have started incorporating Overture base maps into\nservices and products. Meta, for instance, is basing its map solutions on\nOverture data. Microsoft is adopting Overture worldwide to add coverage on\nBing Maps. Esri is beginning to use Overture data to publish new 2D and 3D map\nlayers in ArcGIS, and TomTom will be incorporating Overture data into their\nOrbis Maps, bringing the most comprehensive map for the widest range of use\ncases. With the Beta release, the entire mapping community can begin testing\nOverture data and incorporating it into their service pipelines.\n\nOverture is unique in allowing companies to attach outside data to the\nOverture base map via Overture\u2019s Global Entity Reference System or GERS. In\nthe Beta release, GERS IDs, or unique identifiers, are attached to entities in\nthe data. This allows data to be consistently, correctly and more quickly\nadded to the map. The Beta release also has the most recent improvements to\nthe Overture Maps Data Schema, which allows map services developers to ingest\nand use map data in a standard, documented way and will be interoperable,\nmaking using the data easy and predictable.\n\nThe Beta release includes five unique base layers which have been assembled\nfrom the best available open data sources, formatted in the Overture schema\nand assigned GERS IDs:\n\n  * Places of Interest. This includes data on nearly 54 million places worldwide with associated confidence scores that allow users to build map based local discovery tools or to power local search engines.\n  * Buildings. With 2.3 billion unique building footprints worldwide. Any mapping services provider or developer can add their data on top of the building information, creating new use cases ranging from property management, risk assessment, and economic development to 3D visualization and more.\n  * Transportation. Representing a worldwide network of roads, footpaths and other travel infrastructure that has been provided in a normalized schema for easy use in map applications.\n  * Administrative Boundaries. A global open dataset of national and regional administrative boundaries, this boundary data includes regional names which have been translated into over 40 different languages to support international use.\n  * Base. These contextual layers include land and water data and help complete display maps when needed.\n\nOverture\u2019s Data Recipe\n\nOverture data is sourced from the best open map data sources and conflated\ninto a single dataset. The data comes from community-built data, including\nOpenStreetMap, AI-derived data from satellite/aerial imagery, authoritative\ndata delivered by governments, and newly open commercial data sources. The\ndata then goes through validation and quality checks to ensure that it is safe\nfor use. The ongoing challenge remains maintaining and adding to data to\nreflect changes. To that end, Overture is fostering a broad collaboration to\nbuild and maintain an up-to-date, comprehensive database.\n\nTo join the Overture community or become a member, please visit:\n\nhttps://overturemaps.org/become-a-member/\n\nAbout Overture Maps Foundation\n\nFounded in 2022, Overture Maps Foundation is the world\u2019s leading home for\ncollaboration on the development of reliable, easy-to-use, and interoperable\nopen map data that will power current and next-generation map products.
