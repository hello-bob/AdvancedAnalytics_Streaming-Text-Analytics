For Kevin Maret, an undergraduate art student at the University of\nIdaho, that moment came while reading \u201cIn the Swarm: Digital Prospects,\u201d a\nslim monograph by the philosopher Byung-Chul Han that was first published in\nEnglish by M.I.T., in 2017. In May of 2023, while scrolling Instagram, Maret\nencountered a video gloss on Han\u2019s work; Maret was intrigued enough that he\nborrowed \u201cIn the Swarm\u201d from his university library. Han\u2019s writing, polemical\nand aphoristic, spoke to Maret\u2019s experience of growing up on social media, and\ncrystallized for him the lack of control he felt regarding his relationship to\nthe Internet. In a recent conversation, Maret pointed out a few of his\nfavorite lines: \u201cThe occupants of the digital panopticon are not prisoners.\nTheir element is illusory freedom. They feed the digital panopticon with\ninformation by exhibiting themselves and shining a light on every part of\ntheir lives.\u201d He told me, of the book, \u201cThe first time I read it, I read it in\ntwo hours.\u201d\n\nSince then, Maret has kept \u201cIn the Swarm\u201d out on library loan and carries it\nwith him like a talisman. \u201cI can put this in a jacket pocket if I walk down to\nthe coffee shop or the field by my house,\u201d he told me. He stocked up on other\nbooks by Han: \u201cThe Transparency Society,\u201d \u201cSaving Beauty,\u201d and \u201cThe Agony of\nEros,\u201d which are all written in the same pamphletary format, somewhere between\nmanifesto and essay, and mostly run under a hundred pages. Maret is part of a\ngrowing coterie of readers who have embraced Han as a kind of sage of the\nInternet era. Elizabeth Nakamura, a twentysomething art-gallery associate in\nSan Francisco, had a similar conversion experience, during the early days of\npandemic lockdown, after someone in a Discord chat suggested that she check\nout Han\u2019s work. She downloaded \u201cThe Agony of Eros\u201d from Libgen, a Web site\nthat is known for pirated e-books. (She possesses Han\u2019s books only in PDF\nform, like digital samizdat.) The monograph argues that the overexposure and\nself-aggrandizement encouraged by social media have killed the possibility of\ntruly erotic experience, which requires an encounter with an other. \u201cI\u2019m like\nqueening out reading this,\u201d she told me, using Gen Z slang for effusive\nenjoyment\u2014fangirling. \u201cIt\u2019s a meme but not in the funny way\u2014in the way that\nit\u2019s sort of concise and easily disseminated. I can send this to my friends\nwho aren\u2019t as into reading to help them think about something,\u201d she said. Like\na Sartre for the age of screens, Han puts words to our prevailing condition of\nnot-quite-hopeless digital despair.\n\nBorn in 1959 in South Korea, Han originally studied metallurgy in Seoul, to\nplacate his parents, who wanted him to take up a practical discipline. When he\nwas twenty-two, he moved to Germany; he pledged to continue his studies but\nswitched to philosophy, with a focus on Martin Heidegger. In 1994, he got a\nPh.D. from the University of Freiburg, and then began teaching phenomenology,\naesthetics, and religion, eventually landing at Berlin University of the Arts.\nHe has published steadily throughout the past two decades, but has shunned\ninterviews and has rarely travelled outside of Germany. John Thompson, the\ndirector of Polity, an independent publisher in the United Kingdom that has\nput out fourteen of Han\u2019s books since 2017, told me the demand for his work\nhas grown largely by word of mouth. \u201cThere has been this grassroots reception\nof Byung-Chul Han that has driven the demand, and it\u2019s not the conventional\nway of major review coverage,\u201d he said. Thompson continued, \u201cHe\u2019s like an\nengine. The ideas and the books are just flowing.\u201d\n\nHan\u2019s breakout work was \u201cThe Burnout Society,\u201d originally published in German,\nin 2010. Nearly a decade before the writer Anne Helen Petersen tackled\n\u201cmillennial burnout,\u201d Han diagnosed what he called \u201cthe violence of\npositivity,\u201d deriving from \u201coverproduction, overachievement, and\novercommunication.\u201d We are so stimulated, chiefly by the Internet, that we\nparadoxically cannot feel or comprehend much of anything. One of the ironies\nof Han\u2019s writing is that it travels easily through the very channels that he\ndespairs of. By condensing his ideas into brief, unadorned sentences, Han\nflatters the reader into almost feeling as though she has thought the thoughts\nherself. \u201cThe Burnout Society\u201d and Han\u2019s other books now star in countless\nYouTube explainer videos and TikTok summaries. His ideas have particularly\nstruck a chord with readers who deal in aesthetics\u2014artists, curators,\ndesigners, and architects\u2014even though Han has not quite been embraced by\nphilosophy academe. (An essay in the Los Angeles Review of Books in 2017\ncautiously labelled him \u201cas good a candidate as any for philosopher of the\nmoment.\u201d) His work has been translated into more than a dozen languages.\nAccording to the Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds, \u201cThe Burnout Society\u201d has sold\nmore than a hundred thousand copies across Latin America, Korea, Spain, and\nItaly. A museum director in Beijing told me, \u201cThe Chinese art world is\nobsessed with him.\u201d Alberto Olmos, a well-known Spanish author and critic,\ndescribed Han to me as a \u201cwonderful DJ of philosophy,\u201d spinning together\nreferences\u2014Barthes, Baudrillard, Benjamin\u2014in catchy new combinations. In 2023,\nin an interview with Dazed Korea, the K-pop star RM, from the band BTS,\nrecommended \u201cThe Agony of Eros,\u201d adding, \u201cYou might find yourself deeply\nfrustrated because the book suggests that the love we are currently\nexperiencing is not love.\u201d\n\nMy own first encounter with Han was \u201cNon-things,\u201d which I found positioned\nprominently in the small-press section of an independent bookstore. I was\ndrawn by its gnomic title and the postmodern collage on its cover: a\nphotograph of skyscrapers seen from within a city, spliced with a photo of\nskyscrapers shot from above, turning the buildings into a geometric\nabstraction. In \u201cNon-things,\u201d Han argues that online we encounter a glut of\ninformation\u2014i.e., non-things\u2014that distracts us from having experiences with\nobjects in the world: \u201cThe digital screen determines our experience of the\nworld and shields us from reality.\u201d The best way to read Han is similar to the\nbest way of reading the Bible: flip through, find an evocative line, and\nproceed from there. Each sentence is a microcosm of the book, and each book is\na microcosm of the \u0153uvre, thus the reader need not delve too deep to get the\npoint. \u201cThe smartphone is a mobile labour camp in which we voluntarily intern\nourselves,\u201d Han writes in \u201cNon-things.\u201d Spicy! It is a koan to meditate upon,\nand a description that immediately makes one hate oneself for staring at a\nscreen. I kept reading because I felt like I had to, in case Han might be able\nto offer me some salvation.\n\nHan\u2019s latest book in English translation, \u201cThe Crisis of Narration,\u201d was\npublished in the U.S. earlier this month. (Like comic books, the volumes seem\nto roll out one extended, episodic narrative; all of the Polity editions have\nsimilar cover designs, forming a coherent visual brand.) The book is about the\ndecline of \u201cstorytelling,\u201d which in Han\u2019s argument is an endangered mode of\nestablishing meaning in an age dominated by the bullet points and edited clips\nof content that we consume online. The book builds upon the argument of \u201cNon-\nthings,\u201d but, instead of lamenting a dearth of real-life objects, Han laments\nour ability to narrativize our \u201clived moments.\u201d \u201cFor digital platforms, data\nare more valuable than narratives. They do not want narrative reflection.\u201d Is\nthis why my life as documented on Instagram doesn\u2019t actually add up to a\nunified whole, despite all the time and labor I\u2019ve invested into curating my\naccount? Han\u2019s concept of \u201cinformation,\u201d the opposite of narration, which\nrequires a kind of non-data-driven capacity for imagination, has something in\ncommon with \u201ccontent,\u201d the catchall term that both describes and denatures\ntwenty-first-century culture into so much undifferentiated mush. In \u201cThe\nCrisis of Narration,\u201d Han writes, \u201cIn digital late modernity, we conceal the\nnakedness\u2014the absence of meaning in our lives\u2014by constantly posting, liking,\nand sharing. The noise of communication and information is supposed to ensure\nthat life\u2019s terrifying vacuity remains hidden.\u201d\n\nVideo From The New Yorker\n\nTo that, the Internet-addled brain simply wants to respond: \u201cYas queen!!!\nByung-Chul Han, run me over with a truck.\u201d If you are a denizen of social\nmedia, to read Han is to feel both dragged and affirmed. His status as a kind\nof philosophy daddy to a younger generation is reinforced by the scant\nglimpses that readers get of his personal image. In photographs, he wears\nmainly shades of black, often with a broken-in but still elegant leather\njacket and a thin scarf. His long hair is pulled back into a ponytail, and his\nskin glows like an influencer\u2019s. His telegenic quality belies his isolation\nfrom the media ecosystem. He is not on social platforms; he told El Pa\u00eds in a\nrare interview that he writes three sentences a day and spends most of his\ntime caring for his plants and playing Bach and Schumann on the piano. His\naura of offlineness\u2014we craven online people might be tempted to call it a\npersonal brand\u2014seems to confirm that he has access to some wisdom that the\nrest of us lack.\n\nCharles Pidgeon, a doctoral student in the University of Oxford\u2019s English\nfaculty, who studies literature about the Internet, described Han\u2019s work as\n\u201ckind of old-fashioned humanism: What are you taking from this? Something that\nshould reorient your relationship to the world and to your own life.\u201d But he\nadded that Han\u2019s digestible grand pronouncements don\u2019t always hold up to close\nscrutiny. \u201cThere are a lot of things you can pick holes at,\u201d Pidgeon told me.\nHe pointed to \u201cThe Burnout Society\u201d \u2019s argument that humanity has shifted from\nan \u201cimmunological society,\u201d characterized by barriers, to a \u201cneuronal\nsociety,\u201d characterized by boundlessness and frictionless circulation. Of\ncourse, the COVID pandemic signalled an extreme return to an immunologically\norganized world, which had not really gone away. \u201cThe kind of reductive\nclarity which is so important to how his writing functions is also part of the\nrisk of it going very wrong,\u201d Pidgeon said.\n\nIn \u201cThe Crisis of Narration\u201d especially, Han runs the risk of speaking with\ntoo much curmudgeonly distance from his subject matter. He rightly observes\n\u201cthe present hype around narratives,\u201d which might include the mania for\n\u201cstorytelling\u201d in corporate marketing or the rampant popularity of TED talks.\nHe argues that, though \u201cstories\u201d is a buzzword, we have lost a true, deeper\ncapacity for narrative meaning-making. (Here he evokes the archetypal \u201cfire\naround which humans gather to tell each other stories.\u201d) He describes posting\non social media as \u201cpornographic self-presentation or self-promotion\u201d\u2014which is\nfair enough. There is little in his writing, however, to acknowledge that\ndigital spaces can also produce meaningful experiences, an oversight that, at\nthis point in the twenty-first century, seems almost quaint. We don\u2019t read Han\nfor a holistic orthodoxy; it\u2019s hard to blame a sixty-something-year-old for\nnot grasping TikTok\u2019s paradoxical way of fostering both exploitative and\nemancipatory forms of expression. But he overlooks the way that social media\nenables self-narrativization, the construction and projection of a personal\nidentity, with a freedom that was never possible in the top-down hierarchy of\ntraditional media. For many people, the Internet is the new campfire.\n\nOne has to wonder what Han makes of the way that his own ideas have flourished\nin the Internet information economy, within the avalanche of non-things. When\nwe read about the Internet, we so often crave an answer or a solution: Is a\ntechnology good or bad? How can we escape it? Han is not in the business of\noffering solutions or bullet-pointed life hacks, but online his writing can be\nreadily turned into convenient, digestible lessons. (One TikTok caption:\n\u201cByung-Chul Han and self optimization #capitalism #marxism #therapy.\u201d) Han\u2019s\nbooks \u201ccritique excess digital consumption but are also compatible with it,\u201d\nPidgeon told me. They can be used as \u201canother fashionable or modish set of\nthoughts to be pushed through S.E.O. and imbibed in little chunks by people,\u201d\nhe added. \u201cThat\u2019s the real trap of it. You can never be outside of the system\nthat you\u2019re trying to talk about.\u201d But Han\u2019s ardent, almost brutalist style is\nalso designed to speak for itself, and in that sense it resists digital\nculture\u2019s way of forcing a person to stand in for his creative output. Part of\nHan\u2019s revelation to readers is that they do not have to be a persona. If Han\nposted his own TikTok videos, most commenters would probably just ask what\nbrand of leather jacket he was wearing. (Honestly, I want to know that, too.)\nPerhaps we should take his writing as an incitement to live our own offline\nlives instead. Until we put his ideas into practice, though, his writing\noffers an aspirational symbol to tote around, to flip through, to explain to\nour friends. As Maret, the University of Idaho student, put it, \u201cThe Han Hive\nis activated.\u201d \u2666\n\n## New Yorker Favorites\n\n  * Why facts don\u2019t change our minds.\n\n  * The tricks rich people use to avoid taxes.\n\n  * The man who spent forty-two years at the Beverly Hills Hotel pool.\n\n  * How did polyamory get so popular?\n\n  * The ghostwriter who regrets working for Donald Trump.\n\n  * Snoozers are, in fact, losers.\n\n  * Fiction by Jamaica Kincaid: \u201cGirl\u201d\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New\nYorker.\n\nKyle Chayka is a staff writer for The New Yorker and the author of, most\nrecently, \u201cFilterworld: How Algorithms Flattened Culture.\u201d\n\nMore:InternetPhilosophySocial MediaInstagramTikTok\n\n### Goings On\n\nWhat we\u2019re watching, listening to, and doing this week, online, in N.Y.C., and\nbeyond.
