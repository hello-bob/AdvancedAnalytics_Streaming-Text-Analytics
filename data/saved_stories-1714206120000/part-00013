We\u2019ve never\nproduced a formal Pitch Deck. Instead, I have always written an \u201cInvestor\nMemo\u201d and relied on this memo to lay out the pitch for the company to\nprospective investors.\n\nWe published the first version of our memo in April 2019. Since then, other\ncompanies have adopted this way of pitching investors, and a \u201cmemo\u201d has become\nan acceptable alternative to a standard pitch deck with many investors.\n\nI\u2019ve updated and re-written this memo with each subsequent Rippling financing\nround, and five years later, we\u2019re publishing a (lightly redacted) updated\nversion as of March 2024, below, which we used to raise our series F financing\nand tender.\n\nI thought it would be useful for other entrepreneurs to see this latest\nversion alongside the original one, to see how the Rippling pitch and the\ncompany\u2019s strategy have evolved in the last 5 years.\n\nThe memo is always accompanied by slides of SaaS metrics, projections, and\nfinancials which we are not publishing here \u2013 but this metrics deck has always\nbeen a \u201cjust the facts\u201d dump of data \u2013 the narrative and story is in the memo,\nand we encourage investors to start there.\n\nOne unexpected side benefit of the memo has been recruiting. I always give\ncandidates a copy of this memo before meeting with them, and our recruiting\nteam uses it broadly, as well. It\u2019s a great way for prospective employees to\nbuild an understanding of the company.\n\nlast edited: April 22, 2024\n\n### The Author\n\n### Parker Conrad\n\nRippling CEO\n\n## Explore more\n\nCompany\n\nRippling Announces Series F Fundraising and Tender Offer\n\nThe Rippling Team\n\nCompany\n\nQuality Week: 5 days for engineers to solve the things that annoy them most\n\nThe Rippling Team\n\nCompany\n\nMeet the Ripplers: Zack joined the Rippling \u201crocket ship\u201d to accelerate\ncustomer enablement\n\nThe Rippling Team\n\nSign up for a free demo to see Rippling in action\n\nSee Rippling\n\n##### Platform\n\n  * Rippling Overview\n  * Custom Workflows\n  * Workforce Analytics\n  * Policy Management\n  * Permission Management\n  * Recipe Templates\n  * Global Workforce Management\n\n##### HR Products\n\n  * HR Cloud Overview\n  * US Payroll\n  * Global Payroll\n  * Benefits\n  * Time & Attendance\n  * Talent Management\n  * Recruiting\n  * Headcount Planning\n  * PEO Services\n  * Learning Management\n  * Performance Management\n  * Pulse\n  * Employer of Record\n  * ASO\n  * Global Contractors\n\n##### IT Products\n\n  * IT Cloud Overview\n  * App Management\n  * Device Management\n  * Integrations\n\n##### Finance Products\n\n  * Finance Cloud Overview\n  * Expense Management\n  * Corporate Cards\n  * US Payroll\n  * Global Payroll\n  * Bill Pay\n\n##### Rippling For\n\n  * Technology\n  * Healthcare\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n  * Marketing\n  * Non-Profits\n  * Professional Services\n  * Financial Services\n  * Restaurants\n\n##### Resources\n\n  * Pricing\n  * Customers\n  * Blog\n  * Events\n  * Help Center\n  * Rippling University\n  * Real-Time Support Status\n  * API Documentation\n  * Security & Data Protection\n  * Vulnerability Reporting\n  * Global Hiring Hub\n\n##### Compare\n\n  * vs ADP\n  * vs Paylocity\n  * vs Paycom\n  * vs Paychex\n  * vs Gusto\n  * vs BambooHR\n  * vs Justworks\n  * vs Trinet\n  * vs Zenefits\n  * vs Quickbooks\n  * vs Deel\n  * vs Remote\n  * vs JumpCloud\n\n##### Global Payroll & Hiring\n\n  * Hiring employees in Canada\n  * Hiring employees in the UK\n  * Hiring employees in Australia\n  * Hiring employees in India\n  * Hiring employees in France\n  * Hiring employees in Germany\n  * Hiring employees in Brazil\n  * Hiring employees in Ireland\n  * Hiring employees in the Netherlands\n  * Hiring employees in Poland\n  * Hiring employees in Portugal\n  * Hiring employees in Spain\n  * Hiring employees in Switzerland\n\n##### Partner with Us\n\n  * Brokers\n  * Accountants\n  * Developers\n  * Venture Firms and Accelerators\n\n##### Licenses\n\n  * Rippling Insurance Services, Inc.
