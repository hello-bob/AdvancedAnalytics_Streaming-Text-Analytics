Credit: Getty\n\nCultureLoveNew York TimespolamorypolysculeRomanceUS\n\n#### Latest from the Newsroom\n\n17:12\n\n# Is Trump Media a meme stock?\n\n13:00\n\n# Democrats struggle to control progressives over Gaza\n\n08:00\n\n# Rishi Sunak may have less than two weeks left\n\n###### April 17, 2024 - 7:20pm\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to say about The New York Times\u2019 profile of a 20-person polycule\nin Cambridge, Massachusetts, an article that reads like a very tedious one-act\nplay or a very short History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.\n\nAs is typical for the genre, all the big questions go unanswered, like, \u201cwhy?\u201d\nThe interviewees demonstrate their mastery of the latest social-justice lingo,\nalongside world-historical levels of self-involvement and mind-bending\nlogistics. Check back in seven months for the New York Times\u2019 Gift Guide for\nThe Dearly Beloved Non-Romantic-But-Occasionally-Sexual Life-Partner Pseudo-\nWife in Your Life: \u201cMy husband, my nesting partner, is the person I own a home\nwith. I also have life-partnership friends, I call them my wives, who are core\nmembers in the polycule. One of their husbands is one of my best friends and\noccasional sexual partner, and I do have sex with my wives, but we\u2019re not\nromantically involved. But I love them\u201d.\n\nThe pleasure of reading the article is, of course, purely and shamelessly\nvoyeuristic. But the feelings it inspires are not envy or titillation but\nexhaustion and relief that one has never felt (or indeed ever heard of)\n\u201ccompersion\u201d the feeling of \u201cbeing happy seeing your partner happy with one of\ntheir other partners.\u201d\n\nThe participants wax rhapsodic about liberation, authenticity, empowerment,\nand intentionality. \u201cIt is very much about social change,\u201d Ann says. \u201cIt is\nabout making the world a better place.\u201d Nico praises the fact that the\npolycule is \u201cfemale-run. It\u2019s the female-identified people who spearhead.\u201d\nNonmonogamy is about \u201ca bunch of queer women who say we\u2019re not going to follow\nthe rules.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s a strange gap between the high-flying pronouncements and the\nevidence that makes it unclear whether anyone is in fact being liberated,\nauthentic, or empowered (intentionality, at least, seems to be in abundance).\nWhat\u2019s being reinvented here? They\u2019re 21st-century swingers \u2014 just with fewer\nleisure suits, more worksheets, and vague aspirations to split utility bills\nsometime down the road. The women \u2014 sorry, \u201cfemale-identified people\u201d \u2014 still\nseem to be carrying the mental load, responsible for resolving the scheduling\nnightmares nonmonogamy always seems to entail.\n\nAs far as \u201cnot follow[ing] the rules\u201d goes, they seem merely to have replaced\nthe old \u201cmonogamous script\u201d with a new, infinitely more complicated one,\ntorturously negotiated and renegotiated in \u201csix to 10 hours of hard poly-\nprocessing\u201d sessions.\n\nBack in 1914, the revolutionary Emma Goldman imagined a future where free love\nbetween men and women might be possible: \u201cSome day, men and women will rise,\nthey will reach the mountain peak, they will meet big and strong and free,\nready to receive, to partake, and to bask in the golden rays of love,\u201d she\nwrote. \u201cWhat fancy, what imagination, what poetic genius can foresee even\napproximately the potentialities of such a force in the life of men and women.\nIf the world is ever to give birth to true companionship and oneness, not\nmarriage, but love will be the parent.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not convinced Goldman would recognise the realisation of her vision in\nthese Cambridge house parties, which seem less an exercise in human liberation\nthan Human Resources. Clearly, some people want to turn their personal lives\ninto HR nightmares as part of their \u201cactivism.\u201d They surrounded themselves\nwith dictates: Talk to/about me this way, not that way. Fill out these poly\nworksheets with me. Politicise every interaction, without realising or caring\nthat there is no surer way to destroy everything you touch.\n\nSomewhere along the way, the revolutionary spirit of free love \u2014 however\nimpractical or impossible it may have been \u2014 got lost, replaced by thought\nexercises and pills to make you OK with the bad feelings that seeing your\npartner sleep with other people tends to stir up. Anyone can use the latest\njargon to macerate ordinary human emotions. The problem of how to balance\none\u2019s \u201cradical queer values\u201d with the responsibility and consideration we owe\nto the people closest to us is a more delicate one. No one in this article\nseems to have mastered it.\n\nEliza Mondegreen is a graduate student in psychiatry and the author of Writing\nBehavior on Substack.\n\nelizamondegreen\n\n## Join the discussion\n\n### Join like minded readers that support our journalism by becoming a paid\nsubscriber\n\n### To join the discussion in the comments, become a paid subscriber.\n\n#### Join like minded readers that support our journalism, read unlimited\narticles and enjoy other subscriber-only benefits.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribe\n\n79 Comments\n\nMost Voted\n\nNewest Oldest\n\nInline Feedbacks\n\nView all comments\n\nMustard Clementine\n\n3 days ago\n\nI mean, I generally don\u2019t really care what anyone else does in their private\nlife, but stuff like this makes monogamy seem way more fun and carefree \u2013 and\nit really can be! Feeling valued and secure can be more freeing, in its own\nway. I seriously doubt people who overcomplicate their home life to this\nextent are all that fun to be with; rather, they are likely too annoying to be\nworth the effort. Really, hearing about such arcane setups just makes me\nappreciate my own simple little two-person household even more. I\u2019m also\npretty sure I would rather just be alone, than in a \u201cpolycule\u201d.\n\n6\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nLancashire Lad\n\n3 days ago\n\nReply to Mustard Clementine\n\nYour last point is something worth considering further. How would any of the\npolyculiculars gain free time, i.e. time to be alone? Having to \u2018service\u2019 so\nmany people (in more ways than one) sounds like a living nightmare. Perhaps\nthey\u2019d find \u2018alone time\u2019 to be something they can\u2019t cope with, hence their\nchoice of lifestyle. It won\u2019t last.\n\n1\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nMartin M\n\n2 days ago\n\nReply to Mustard Clementine\n\nMonogamy can be fun provided it is done in suitably small doses.\n\n0\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nRight-Wing Hippie\n\n2 days ago\n\nReply to Martin M\n\nMonogamy is at its most satisfactory when practiced with only one partner at a\ntime.\n\n0\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nMartin M\n\n2 days ago\n\nReply to Right-Wing Hippie\n\nYes, obviously. It wouldn\u2019t be monogamy if it wasn\u2019t.

I don\u2019t notice any mention in the article of children. And on\naverage, the life outcomes of children who see their mother (it\u2019s mostly\nmothers, since the fathers tend to bu**er off pretty quickly) move from one\npartner to another, whether regularly or otherwise, are not particularly\ndesirable.\n\n1\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nMartin M\n\n1 day ago\n\nReply to Sue Sims\n\nDivorce is pretty much the standard nowadays, so kids are every chance of\ngrowing up in what used to be called a \u201cbroken home\u201d anyway.

But there are other ways, that\nhave flourished at various times and places. My own first encounter with them\nwas in the 1970s among gay and bisexual men, fed by wide discussion of\nrelationships in a context when all our relationships were to some extent\nexperiments in living (they could not be officially recognised and most of us\nthen thought they would not be in our lifetime). So, we learned on the\ncase\u2014and it was sometimes bumpy and painful\u2014that you could be faithful to a\npartner without that term requiring sexual monogamy. Unburdening a faithful\nrelationship of a requirement for sexual monogamy gives it a much better\nchance of surviving, as countless couples of all sexualities have since\ntestified. This seems to apply even in the case that the partners rarely\nexercise the agreed freedoms. Of course, there needs to be an understanding,\nhonest and equal faithful relationship for this to work. And it wont be for\nthose whose instincts about partnering seem still to be wedded to a kind of\nmutual ownership, something which traditional marriages\u2014and, paradoxically,\ndivorce lawyers\u2014both encourage. It is encouraged too, by religious zealots of\nall stripes of the sort who put a wholly disproportionate emphasis on sex acts\nas a type of human communication. It is not the language that is spoken\nbetween two humans that matters, but what is said. I suspect that in many\nunrecorded lives over many centuries the de-coupling of faithful relationships\nand monogamy has been widespread, quietly and successfully practiced. But the\nrecord is patchy and very sparse; very few people historically have written\nthis stuff up, even in private diaries, let alone in the New York Times.\n\n0\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nAlison Wren\n\n1 day ago\n\nReply to Roland Jeffery\n\nYes, gay men rarely seem to practice sexual monogamy, but then their sexual\nbehaviours aren\u2019t going to result in children. Despite the Pill,\ncontraceptives fail and babies result who need stability. In the 1970s we\ntalked about \u201copen marriage \u201d nothing new under the sun. Few of those\nmarriages seem to have survived.\n\n2\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nGraham Stull\n\n2 days ago\n\nReply to Right-Wing Hippie\n\nOr as the late, great George Michael put it: \u201cSex is natural, sex is fun.

I do\nappreciate your comment, however, and wonder what you make of this article on\nsex abused by public school educators in the U.S.\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/has-media-ignored-sex-abuse-in-school/ It\u2019s based\non a study that came out about twenty years go and purports that the abuse in\nthe public education system is far worse than anything that happened in the\nCatholic Church and yet oddly enough there has been very little hue and cry\nover this issue.\n\n2\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nMartin M\n\n1 day ago\n\nReply to Julian Farrows\n\nI can\u2019t really speak on what happened in US schools, as I grew up in\nAustralia. I can say that during my school years, there was no suggestion\nwhatsoever that there was sexual abuse in government schools (although there\nwere cases of it in the Scouts or sporting groups). However, even when I was a\nkid, the rumours of what happened in Catholic schools abounded. I guess the\nmain difference is that in the Catholic system, the Church rallied round to\nprotect Priests who were accused, thus perpetrating the system.\n\n0\n\n0\n\nReply\n\njane baker\n\n1 day ago\n\nReply to Martin M\n\nMy Mother said Always look under the bed Before you blow the candle out See if\nthere\u2019s a man about I always do You can make a bet But it\u2019s never been my luck\nTo find a man there yet!\n\nNellie Wallace old time (and very funny) Music Hall song performed on The Good\nOld Days many years ago but very memorably by a young,and hilarious Sue\nPollard.\n\nSeems to me a lot of people spend their time \u201clooking under the bed\u201d.\n\n1\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nAlan Gore\n\n2 days ago\n\nWokesters have found ways of sucking the fun out of everything \u2013 even sex.\n\n0\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nRichard Kurth\n\n2 days ago\n\nPolycule is not exactly poetic, is it.\n\n0\n\n0\n\nReply\n\nMister Smith\n\n2 days ago\n\nI doubt many of these people have jobs.
