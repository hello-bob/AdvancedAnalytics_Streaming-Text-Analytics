He did so using an old\nresearch method that he revamped for use on smartphones. Zech will defend his\nPh.D. on 30 April.\n\nAddiction, phobia, and intuitive behavior: psychologists have discovered much\nabout them with the Approach Avoidance Task. Hilmar Zech has successfully\nmodernized this old research method.\n\n\"Participants sit behind a computer and can move a joystick towards or away\nfrom themselves. They must quickly react to images appearing on the screen:\nthey can either bring them closer or remove them.\" This method has revealed\nmuch about unconscious behavior, which cannot be elucidated with\nquestionnaires, for instance.\n\n\"For example, if you show erotic stimuli and someone pushes the joystick\nslightly too late away from themselves, you know from the reaction time that\nthe actual reflex was different,\" says Zech.\n\nThe method has taught psychologists a lot about addictions, phobias, and\nintuitions. However, this could only be done behind computers in the research\nenvironment of psychology departments, familiar to many students who\noccasionally earned some money as test subjects.\n\n\"This has real drawbacks. For instance, someone's reaction to food varies\nthroughout the day. You would want to test people at different times, before\nand after eating. This is difficult in this setting.\"\n\nZech taught himself programming, and took on the challenge at the Leiden Unit\nof Social, Economic, and Organizational Psychology to make the method\napplicable to a smartphone. \"It required a completely different program, where\nyou can measure responses not with a joystick, but with the movement of your\nphone.\"\n\nParticipants can move their phone towards or away from themselves in response\nto images they see. \"In addition to reaction time, we can even measure more\nthan with the joystick: we measure the force with which the phone is moved.\nThat force provides extra information about the intensity of the response, on\ntop of reaction time.\"\n\nAfter the app was validated and proven reliable, Zech and his supervisors\nLotte van Dillen and Wilco van Dijk made an intriguing discovery. \"We showed\npeople food images in their own environment, before and after eating. We\nexpected that before eating, they would show more approach behavior towards\nimages of food than after. That was true, but only for people with a healthy\nweight. People with overweight or obesity sometimes even showed the opposite:\nthey exhibited stronger approach behavior towards food after eating.\"\n\nAccording to Zech, this outcome could mean two things: \"Perhaps people\nrestrained themselves from eating too much during the meal and still have a\nstrong desire for food. Or maybe they weren't thinking much about food before\neating, but were still half-focused on their work. After eating, they might\nhave been primed and respond more strongly to food images.\"\n\nThis is something other researchers can start to explore. Is Zech perhaps\nplanning to retire quietly from the revenues of his handy app? He says, \"I\ndidn't apply for a patent. I'd rather have researchers be able to use the\napplication for free.\" Besides his work as a postdoc at TU Dresden he\ncontinues to refine the app. \"Researchers still need some assistance from me\nto set up the app properly. I want to ensure that everyone can customize\neverything to their needs, without my help, and store all data on their own\nserver.\"\n\nProvided by Leiden University\n\nCitation: Intriguing food reflex discovered with a smartphone (2024, April 26)\nretrieved 3 May 2024 from https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-04-intriguing-\nfood-reflex-smartphone.html\n\nThis document is subject to copyright.
