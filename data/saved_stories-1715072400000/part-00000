How does rapamycin work to promote ovarian function? In\nthis article, Dr. Ryan Marshall from the Metabolic & Molecular Physiology\nResearch Group at the University of Birmingham reviews these latest findings\nand how rapamycin may be utilized to enhance reproductive health and longevity\nin women.\n\nrapamycin\n\nFemale Fertility\n\n12 mins\n\nBy: Dr Ryan N. Marshall, PhD.\n\nThe average age of a first-time mother in the USA and UK is 30 & 31,\nrespectively, with more women leaving it later in life to bear children than\never before. This age is considerably higher than the average age of 21 in the\n1970s. There are many reasons why this exponential increase has occurred over\nthe last 50 years. However, it can be largely attributed to (1) the cost of\nrearing a child [1], (2) education/career aspirations, or (3) failure to meet\nthe right partner. It is also well established that females decline in their\nability to successfully bear a child as they age, with a 98% reduction in\nreproductive cells/egg (termed 'oocytes') from birth to age 37 (~2 million to\n~25,000). This is further worsened as oocytes decline to ~1,000 by age 50 and\nthe start of menopause [2].\n\nTherefore, several research groups worldwide have sought to determine methods\nto understand and prolong a woman's reproductive lifespan, enhance ovarian\nhealth, and mitigate biological age's detrimental effects on the female\nreproductive system.\n\nOne noteworthy therapeutic is rapamycin, a well-established anti-aging &\nlongevity compound. Among the several benefits of rapamycin to human health,\nrecent research has begun to demonstrate that rapamycin may have significant\nbenefits for women's health, particularly in preserving ovarian function,\nfertility, and delaying menopause.\n\nSo, what does the science say? In this article, we discuss these exciting\nfindings and how rapamycin may be utilized to enhance reproductive health and\nlongevity in women.\n\n### An Overview of Female Reproduction During Ageing\n\nAs women age, their bodies undergo a remarkable journey of reproductive aging.\nUnderstanding the basic biology behind these changes can empower women to make\ninformed decisions about their reproductive health & well-being.\n\n### The Decline of Ovary Health:\n\nThe ovaries are central players in a woman's reproductive system and\nexperience significant changes as they age. Evidence shows that women are born\nwith approximately one to two million oocytes (eggs), but by the time they\nreach puberty, this number decreases to around 300,000 to 500,000 [2]. As a\nwoman approaches her 30s, the decline in egg quantity accelerates, with an\nestimated 12% reduction per year. By age 35, the decline becomes even steeper,\nand by 40, only 2% of a woman's original egg supply remains [2].\n\n> \"Oocytes\" refer to the female reproductive cells or eggs found in the\n> ovaries of animals, including humans. These cells are produced and stored\n> within the ovaries and play a crucial role in sexual reproduction. Oocytes\n> are the largest cells in the human body, visible to the naked eye. They are\n> formed during the early stages of fetal development and remain dormant until\n> maturity.\"\n\n### Quality vs Quantity:\n\nWhile the quantity of oocytes diminishes with age, so does their quality [3].\nThe molecular decline in oocyte quality results from genome instability,\nreduced mitochondrial function, increased ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species), and\ndisturbances in chromosome segregation [3]. As a result, the likelihood of\nconceiving decreases with age, and the risk of chromosomal abnormalities and\ngenetic disorders (i.e., Downs Syndrome) in newborn children increases [4].\n\nThe primary biological mechanism is thought to be an increase in meiotic\nnondisjunction, resulting in an increased rate of aneuploidy in the early\nembryo [5] \u2013 Which, in simpler terms, means as women age, there is a higher\nchance of errors occurring during the division of cells in the early stages of\nembryo development. This leads to an increased risk of having an abnormal\nnumber of chromosomes in the embryo, a condition known as aneuploidy [6].\n\nThere have been several attempts to restore and maintain oocyte quantity and\nquality with nutraceutical approaches such as Resveratrol [7], Coenzyme Q10\n[8], Vitamin C [9], and NMN [10] to target the increased mitochondrial ROS &\nDNA damage associated with oocyte aging, albeit with limited effects. Amongst\nthe previously mentioned biological mechanisms, mTOR has an often overlooked\nrole in the activation and dysregulation of ovarian growth signaling of\nprimordial follicles.\n\n> \"Primordial follicles are the earliest stage of ovarian follicle development\n> and represent the reserve of immature eggs (oocytes).\"\n\nIt is well established that during aging, cells, and tissues become\nhyperactive, resulting in dysregulated nutrient sensing, impaired autophagy,\nand accumulation of senescent cells. This process is largely regulated by\nhyperactive mTOR-related signaling. Thus, following primordial follicle\nactivation from follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone\n(LH), mTOR is crucial in the growth and development of mature follicles. The\npharmacological manipulation and reduction in mTOR activity with rapamycin\nhave been proposed as a highly promising strategy to improve oocyte quantity\nand quality [11].\n\n### Background on Rapamycin\n\nRapamycin is a macrolide compound that has been shown to have a wide range of\nbiological effects, including immunosuppressive, anti-cancer, and longevity\nproperties [12]. Notably, rapamycin was 1 of only 10 (out of 64) therapeutics\ntested so far as part of the Interventions Testing Programme (ITP) at the\nNational Institute on Aging (NIA) that improved lifespan [13]. Other\nsuccessful therapeutics were Acarbose [14], Aspirin [15], Canagliflozin [16],\nGlycine [17], Protandim [18], 17\u03b1-estradiol [14] and nordihydroguaiaretic acid\n[15]. Since then, several research groups from around the world have begun to\ndemonstrate that the off-label repurposing of rapamycin may also serve the\npotential as a therapeutic to prevent many non-communicable diseases [12].\n\nThe primary mechanism in which rapamycin has a beneficial therapeutic effect\nis by inhibiting the activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a\nkey regulator of cellular metabolism, growth, and proliferation. Specifically,\nrapamycin binds to a protein called FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP12), which\nthen dephosphorylates mTOR, thereby 'turning off' downstream growth signals\nsuch as P70S6K & ribosomal complexes needed for cellular growth [19].\n\n> Chronic overactivation of mTOR is at the foundation of many age-related\n> diseases. As we get older, mTOR may stay active all the time\u2014opening the\n> door to out-of-control cell growth that can lead to cancer and closing the\n> door on cell repair. It is a driver of toxic cellular hyperactivity, leading\n> to the decline of healthy tissue.\n\nBy inhibiting mTOR, rapamycin can reduce cellular growth (improved\nproteostasis), increase mitochondrial function (reduced ROS production) [20],\nincrease autophagy [21], and enhance overall metabolic health [22], which has\nbeen shown to have a wide range of therapeutic effects.\n\n## An Overview of the Established Effects of Rapamycin\n\n  * Longevity: Perhaps the most well-studied effect of rapamycin is its ability to enhance longevity in a variety of model organisms, including mice, flies, and worms. In these models, treatment with rapamycin has been shown to extend lifespan by up to 30% or more. However, the original ITP NIA longevity study on rapamycin conducted by Professor David Harrison at The Jackson Laboratory showed a 9-14% increase in lifespan [13].\n\n  * Cancer: Rapamycin has shown promising benefits in cancer treatment. Cancer cells display increased activation of mTOR and metabolic reprogramming, making them highly glycolytic, resulting in rapid tumour growth. Rapamycin can inhibit the growth and proliferation of cancer cells by blocking mTOR and minimizing tumour growth. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests it processes anti-vascular effects, reducing vascular endothelial growth factors in tumours [23]. Additionally, rapamycin has demonstrated the ability to enhance the effectiveness of other anti-cancer therapies and reduce drug resistance [24].\n\n  * Neurological Disease: Rapamycin has been shown to have potential as a therapeutic for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease [25]. This effect is thought to be due to the ability of rapamycin to enhance autophagy, which can help to reduce amyloid-\u03b2 deposition [26], prevent tau-induced neuronal loss [27], and improve cognitive function [26]. Overall, drastically rapamycin drastically improves spatial learning and memory in older mice. Although there is no direct human evidence to date, Professor Mitzi Gonzales of the University of Texas, San Antonio, is currently running a 12-month clinical trial into the effects of daily rapamycin (1mg dose) to determine its effect on brain volume, cerebral metabolism, and functional cognitive testing\n\nin patients with diagnosed Alzheimer's \u2013 We are very much looking forward to\nseeing the data on this in the future.\n\n## Can Rapamycin Improve Female Reproductive Health?\n\nUnlocking the potential of rapamycin as a therapeutic intervention to prevent\nmenopause and enhance ovarian health in women has become an increasingly\npopular avenue of research for longevity researchers. The shift in the\nhormonal environment during menopause brings about a significant shift in a\nwoman's reproductive health, often accompanied by a decline in ovarian\nfunction. Recent studies have shed light on rapamycin's ability to extend\novarian lifespan, enhance oocyte quality, and delay reproductive senescence.\nExploring the benefits of rapamycin as a therapeutic agent holds promise for\npreserving fertility and improving women's overall youthfulness into older\nage. Here we delve into the emerging evidence and discuss the potential of\nrapamycin as a game-changer in women's reproductive health.\n\n### Rapamycin and Fertility\n\nAs women age, their ovaries begin to produce fewer oocytes, which can lead to\ninfertility and other reproductive issues [28]. Recent studies have shown that\nrapamycin can improve ovarian function and increase the number of eggs\nproduced by the ovaries.In one study published in Aging Cell titled\n'Short\u2010term rapamycin treatment increases ovarian lifespan in young and\nmiddle\u2010aged female mice', female mice treated with rapamycin had a\nsignificantly greater egg quality [29]. In particular, across the lifespan of\na mouse, from 4.5 months to 12 months (equivalent human age of 25 & 45 years),\nthe number of oocytes decreased by ~75%, with 20% and 42% of oocytes\nexpressing abnormalities.\n\n> \"Primordial follicles are the earliest stage of follicular development. They\n> consist of a primary oocyte surrounded by a single layer of flat granulosa\n> cells. Following activation, they transition to primary follicles, in which\n> the oocyte is still surrounded by a single layer of granulosa cells, but\n> these cells have become more cuboidal in shape. Additionally, a specialized\n> layer called the zona pellucida starts forming around the oocyte. The last\n> phase of development is the tertiary follicles. These are the most advanced\n> stage of follicular development before ovulation and have a large antrum\n> filled with fluid and are surrounded by several layers of granulosa cells.\n> Tertiary follicles eventually undergo ovulation, where the mature oocyte is\n> released from the ovary, ready for fertilization.\"\n\nAlthough the rapamycin-treated mice observed a similar decline in oocyte\nnumber to the placebo, there was a large reduction in the number of oocyte\nabnormalities, with only 10% & 20% of oocytes at 4.5 months and 12 months of\nage displaying abnormalities [29]. This may be attribu\n\nted to the ~26% greater abundance of primordial follicles in the rapamycin-\ntreated group compared to placebo.\n\nA patient's positive response to rapamycin in treating ovarian aging, as\nfeatured on Rapamycin News.\n\n> The expression of the active protein involved in mTOR & cell growth, rpS6,\n> was reduced by >85% [29]. Overall, showing rapamycin has the potential to\n> preserve primordial follicles and enhance egg quality via the reduction in\n> mTOR activity, which may result in increased chances of a successful\n> pregnancy.\n\n### Rapamycin and Menopause\n\nMenopause is a natural process that occurs in women at approximately 50 years\nof age, although it can develop <40 years of age (termed 'early menopause'),\nand it is deemed the end of a women's ovarian lifespan [28].\n\nThe end of a woman's fertility window is a result of empty follicle pool\nreserves, in which no primordial follicles remain. A measurement of primordial\nfollicle reserve can be established via an invasive ovarian biopsy; however,\nthe levels of anti-m\u00fcllerian hormone give a detailed non-invasive\nquantification.\n\nThe treatment of rapamycin has been shown to increase anti-m\u00fcllerian hormone\nby >100% following a treatment regime of 4mg/kg/EOD for three months [30].\nInterestingly, rapamycin did not alter the total number of follicles, but\ncompared to placebo, rapamycin modified the number of primordial (+83%),\nprimary (-57%), and tertiary follicles (-37%) [30].\n\n> Overall, rapamycin has the capability of altering follicle development to\n> maintain a higher follicular reserve, thereby extending a women's\n> reproductive lifespan and offsetting menopause by potentially years or even\n> decades.\n\n### Future Research on Rapamycin and Ovarian Aging\n\nThe University of Columbia, New York, recently have begun recruitment on a\nworld-first study investigating the effects of 12 weeks of rapamycin on\ndelaying the start of menopause. The study is being conducted by Professor Zev\nWilliams, an Associate Professor of Women's Health and the Chief of the\nDivision of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility of Columbia\nUniversity's Irving Medical Centre. In short, the primary objective of the\n12-week long study is looking to determine the effects of a normal 5mg/week\ndose can improve ovarian reserve measured via transvaginal ultrasound. Other\nsecondary outcomes include evaluating the levels of anti-m\u00fcllerian hormone,\nestradiol, follicle stimulating hormone, and levels of Klotho. As the study\nhas recently begun recruitment in April 2023, we eagerly await results from\nthis clinical trial in the coming years \u2013 If you're local to Columbia\nUniversity and are interested in taking part, please find more details here.\n\n> \"anti-m\u00fcllerian hormone has clinical significance as a fertility biomarker\n> for assessing ovarian reserve, which refers to the quantity and quality of a\n> woman's remaining eggs.\"\n\n### To Wrap it up - What does all this mean?\n\nRapamycin has shown significant promise for improving women's health in\npreclinical models. From improving ovarian function and menopause symptoms to\npreventing uterine fibroids, rapamycin has the potential to help women live\nhealthier, more fulfilling lives as they age.While more research is needed to\nfully understand the benefits of rapamycin in humans, the current evidence\nsuggests that it could be a valuable tool for improving women's reproductive\nhealth, allowing them to have children later in life, and delaying the side\neffects associated with menopause and hormonal replacement therapy.\n\nTAKE HOME POINTS\n\n  * Increasing Age of First-time Mothers: In recent decades, the average age at which women in the USA and UK have their first child has risen to 30 and 31, respectively, up from 21 in the 1970s. This trend reflects broader societal changes, where women are prioritizing higher education and career advancement before starting a family. Additionally, economic considerations and the challenges of finding a suitable partner also contribute to this delay.\n\n  * Decline in Female Fertility with Age: As women age, their reproductive potential decreases significantly. Starting with approximately 2 million oocytes at birth, a woman's egg count drops to about 25,000 by age 37 and plummets to around 1,000 by the onset of menopause at around age 50. This decline not only reduces the likelihood of pregnancy but also increases the risk of genetic abnormalities in offspring due to decreased oocyte quality and increased chromosomal errors during cell division.\n\n  * Rapamycin as a Potential Solution for Age-Related Fertility Decline: The article discusses the potential of rapamycin, a drug known for its anti-aging effects, to mitigate the impact of aging on female reproductive health. Rapamycin works by inhibiting mTOR signaling, which is involved in cellular aging and may lead to improved ovarian function and extended fertility lifespan. Research shows that rapamycin can help preserve the quantity and enhance the quality of oocytes, thus potentially delaying menopause and extending a woman's reproductive years.\n\n  * Broader Benefits and Ongoing Research: Beyond its applications in reproductive health, rapamycin has been shown to offer benefits in treating diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease. The drug's ability to reduce cellular aging and enhance cellular repair mechanisms makes it a promising candidate for extending healthy lifespan in humans. Current research, including a significant study at Columbia University, aims to further validate rapamycin's effectiveness in improving ovarian reserve and delaying menopause, with implications for women's health and longevity.\n\nCitations\n\n  1. 2015 Expenditures on Children By Families | Food and Nutrition Service. https://www.fns.usda.gov/resource/2015-expenditures-children-families.\n\n  2.
