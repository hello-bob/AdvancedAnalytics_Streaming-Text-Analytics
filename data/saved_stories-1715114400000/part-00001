It's unclear if the data\nhad ever been accessed by anyone with malicious intent.\n\nAmberstone Security offers surveillance, access control, and merchandise-\nprotection products and services, as well as guards on 24-hour duty to\ncustomers.\n\nAmong the exposed data, which dates back to 2017, was a folder containing\n99,151 snapshots of guards checking in for their shifts, either by using a\npicture of themselves, their ID cards, or both. The pictures taken of the ID\ncards displayed basic information such as their name, headshot, and the card's\nexpiry date. In rare cases, it showed their signature too.\n\nThe ID cards were also issued by the Security Industry Authority (SIA), the\nUK's regulator for the private security industry. The cards do not have any\nbiometric technology built into them and are basic, plastic ID cards that\nhypothetically could be fairly easily duped and abused.\n\nSpeaking to The Register, researcher Jeremiah Fowler, claimed the SIA told him\nthere are plans to introduce biometry to the cards in the near future.\nHowever, there is no specific date for this.\n\n\"The exposure of SIA identification documents could pose a serious potential\nthreat to public safety, personal privacy, and the integrity of security\noperations if misused by unauthorized individuals,\" said Fowler.\n\n\"One hypothetical example of a risk scenario would be if criminals used the\nexposed information such as the guard's names, photographs, and license\nnumbers to impersonate security personnel or gain unauthorized access to a\nsecure facility for criminal purposes. This could potentially lead to a\nphysical security breach, theft, vandalism, or \u2013 as a worst-case scenario \u2013\nacts of terrorism.\"\n\nExposing a database in any case would present obvious privacy risks, and these\nare amplified if the exposed data ties an individual to a suspected crime,\nwhich was the case in this incident.\n\nFowler says the documents found in the exposed database showed images of\nsuspected offenders either seemingly caught in the act via CCTV or\nphotographed by security personnel afterward. Many images clearly depicted the\nsuspects and were captioned with information such as their name, date of\nbirth, and nature of their alleged offense.\n\nIn some cases, detailed descriptions of how a suspect operates were found,\nsaid Fowler. One man and his associates were known to frequent the Lakeside\nand Stratford shopping centers in the south east of England, for example, and\napparently had a particular penchant for high-value men's suits.\n\nThe description contained details about how suspected offenders got away with\nthe thefts, mentioning that they later return to the store and target young\nstaff to complete a confusing process to obtain a cash refund on the stolen\ngoods.\n\nSimilarly, spreadsheets were also filled with information about offenses, how\nthey were committed, and whether violence was used or not.\n\n  * UK's Investigatory Powers Bill to become law despite tech world opposition\n  * Exposed: Chinese smartphone farms that run thousands of barebones mobes to do crime\n  * Amazon Ring sounds death knell for surveillance as a service\n  * UK policing minister urges doubling down on face-scanning tech\n\n### Swift response\n\nA day after being alerted to the exposed database, Amberstone Security revoked\npublic access to the database and informed Fowler that the blunder may have\nbeen caused by a third party.\n\n\"Thank you for bringing this to our attention, this is deeply concerning. I am\ninvestigating this with the supplier who developed and hosts the platform,\" a\ncompany rep told the researcher. \"Please rest assured that we take data\nsecurity seriously, and this will be investigated thoroughly.\"\n\nThe Register contacted Amberstone for a response and a spokesperson for parent\ncompany Argenbright Security Europe said: \"Amberstone were made aware of a\nserver configuration issue and immediately contained any risks. We have acted\naccordingly and in line with our regulatory obligations.\"\n\nThe identity of the third-party contractor was not specified by Amberstone\nSecurity. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Database\n  * Data Breach\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Database\n  * Data Breach\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * MongoDB\n  * MySQL\n  * NoSQL\n  * PostgreSQL\n  * RSA Conference\n  * SQL\n  * SQL Server\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Oracle\n  * Security\n  * Software\n\n#### More about\n\n13 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Database\n  * Data Breach\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Database\n  * Data Breach\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * MongoDB\n  * MySQL\n  * NoSQL\n  * PostgreSQL\n  * RSA Conference\n  * SQL\n  * SQL Server\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Oracle\n  * Security\n  * Software\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Cybercriminals threaten to leak all 5 million records from stolen\ndatabase of high-risk individuals\n\nIt\u2019s the second time the World-Check list has fallen into the wrong hands\n\nCyber-crime18 days | 22\n\n#### Qantas app glitch sees boarding passes fly to other accounts\n\nIssue now resolved and isn't thought to be the work of criminals\n\nCSO6 days | 8\n\n#### Oracle's database family gets trendy AI makeover\n\nSay goodbye to 23c and hello to 23ai\n\nDatabases4 days | 11\n\n#### Java thriving after 30 years\n\nWhy OpenJDK is as important as ever in the big picture of IT\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Over a million Neighbourhood Watch members exposed through web app bug\n\nUnverified users could scoop up data on high-value individuals without any\nform of verification process\n\nSecurity14 days | 29\n\n#### Graph databases speaking the same language after ISO gives GQL the nod\n\nStandards body adoption could help ease portability between vendors\n\nDatabases13 days | 5\n\n#### Second time lucky for Thoma Bravo, which scoops up Darktrace for $5.3B\n\nAnalysts brand deal a 'nail in the coffin' for UK tech investment\n\nSecurity11 days | 4\n\n#### It may take decade to shore up software supply chain security, says\ninfosec CEO\n\ninterview Sure, we're waking to the risk, but we gotta get outta bed, warns\nEndor Labs founder Varun Badhwar\n\nCSO4 days | 24\n\n#### Three years on from Biden infosec EO, and we're still trying to check all\nthe boxes\n\ninterview It's taking time, but isn't a dead issue, US Government\nAccountability Office security director Marisol Cruz Cain says\n\nPublic Sector1 day |\n\n#### Chinese government website security is often worryingly bad, say Chinese\nresearchers\n\nExclusive Bad configurations, insecure versions of jQuery, and crummy cookies\nare some of myriad problems\n\nPublic Sector5 days | 28\n\n#### Federal frenzy to patch gaping GitLab account takeover hole\n\nWarning comes exactly a year after the vulnerability was introduced\n\nCyber-crime5 days | 8\n\n#### Alibaba Yitian 710 rated fastest Arm server CPU in the cloud (for now)\n\nResearcher finds it beats Intel's Xeons for speed on one database-related\ntests, joins AWS Gravitons in cost-efficiency win\n\nOff-Prem8 days | 6\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
