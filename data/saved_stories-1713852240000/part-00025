Shortly after Section 702 expired at midnight,\nApril 19, the Senate pushed through a two-year reauthorization \u2014 one pretty\nmuch free of any reforms.\n\nThis happened despite there being a large and vocal portion of the Republican\nparty seeking to curb the FBI\u2019s access to these collections because some of\ntheir own had been subjected to the sort of abuse that has become synonymous\nwith the FBI\u2019s interaction with this particular surveillance program.\n\nThe reauthorization passed to the Senate from the House had been stripped of a\nproposed warrant requirement and saddled with an especially expansive\ndefinition of the term \u201celectronic communication service provider.\u201d Here\u2019s how\nSenator Ron Wyden explained it while speaking out against the amendment:\n\n> Now, if you have access to any communications, the government can force you\n> to help it spy. That means anyone with access to a server, a wire, a cable\n> box, a wifi router, a phone, or a computer. Think about the millions of\n> Americans who work in buildings and offices in which communications are\n> stored or pass through.\n>\n> After all, every office building in America has data cables running through\n> it. These people are not just the engineers who install, maintain and repair\n> our communications infrastructure; there are countless others who could be\n> forced to help the government spy, including those who clean offices and\n> guard buildings. If this provision is enacted, the government could deputize\n> any one of these people against their will, and force them to become an\n> agent for Big Brother.\n>\n> For example, by forcing an employee to insert a USB thumb drive into a\n> server at an office they clean or guard at night.\n>\n> This could all happen without any oversight. The FISA Court won\u2019t know about\n> it. Congress won\u2019t know about it. The Americans who are handed these\n> directives will be forbidden from talking about it. And unless they can\n> afford high priced lawyers with security clearances who know their way\n> around the FISA Court, they will have no recourse at all.\n\nSo, instead of reform, we\u2019re getting an even worse version of what\u2019s already\nbeen problematic, especially when the FBI\u2019s involved. As the clock ticked down\non this vote (but not really: the FISA court had already granted the Biden\nadministration\u2019s request to keep the program operable as-is until 2025),\nattempts were made to strip the bill of this dangerous addition and add back\nin the warrant requirement amendment that had failed in the House.\n\nNone of this worked, as Gaby Del Valle reports for The Verge:\n\n> Sens. Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Josh Hawley (R-MO) introduced an amendment that\n> would have struck language in the House bill that expanded the definition of\n> \u201celectronic communications service provider.\u201d Under the House\u2019s new\n> provision, anyone \u201cwho has access to equipment that is being or may be used\n> to transmit or store wire or electronic communications.\u201d The expansion,\n> Wyden has claimed, would force \u201cordinary Americans and small businesses to\n> conduct secret, warrantless spying.\u201d The Wyden-Hawley amendment failed\n> 34-58, meaning that the next iteration of the FISA surveillance program will\n> be more expansive than before.\n>\n> Both Sens. Paul and Dick Durbin (D-IL) introduced separate amendments\n> imposing warrant requirements on surveilling Americans. A similar amendment\n> failed in the House on a 212-212 vote. Durbin\u2019s narrower warrant requirement\n> wouldn\u2019t require intelligence agencies to obtain a warrant to query for\n> those communications, though it requires one to access them.\n\nThe version headed to the president\u2019s desk is the worst version. The rush to\npush this version of the bill through possibly gained a little urgency when\ntwo unnamed service providers informed the government they would stop\ncomplying with FISA orders pretty much immediately if the Senate didn\u2019t renew\nthe program.\n\n> One communications provider informed the National Security Agency that it\n> would stop complying on Monday with orders under Section 702 of the Foreign\n> Intelligence Surveillance Act, which enables U.S. intelligence agencies to\n> gather without a warrant the digital communications of foreigners overseas \u2014\n> including when they text or email people inside the United States.\n>\n> Another provider suggested that it would cease complying at midnight Friday\n> unless the law is reauthorized, according to the people familiar with the\n> matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive\n> negotiations.\n\nWe\u2019ll never know how empty these threats might have been or if the\nIntelligence Community would have even noticed the brief interruption in the\nflow of communications. Section 702 has been given a two-year extension in the\nform approved by the Senate, superseding the FISA Court\u2019s blessing of one more\nyear of uninterrupted spying if discussions over renewal blew past the April\n19, 2024 deadline.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of bipartisan efforts \u2014 no matter the outcome \u2014 well... enjoy\nyour victory, I guess. But there\u2019s nothing about this renewal debacle that can\nactually be called a win. Unless you\u2019re the FBI, of course. Then it\u2019s all\ngravy.\n\nFiled Under: 4th amendment, fbi, fisa, nsa, ron wyden, section 702,\nsurveillance\n\n4 CommentsLeave a Comment\n\nIf you liked this post, you may also be interested in...\n\n  * 96% Of Hospitals Share Sensitive Visitor Data With Meta, Google, and Data Brokers\n  * Senate Must Follow House's Lead In Passing Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act\n  * Sextortion Is A Real & Serious Criminal Issue; Blaming Section 230 For It Is Not\n  * Senate Now Considering Section 702 Re-Up With A Dangerous Amendment Attached To It\n  * Roku Eyes Patent That Would Inject Ads Into...

I brought my telescope which made me popular, and it was great letting other people look through it\n  * John Roddy: It was so overcast for me that I legit couldn't even see clouds.\n  * mildconcern: I wasn't really aiming to take pictures primarily but I did get a few\n  * John Roddy: Just a perfectly homogenous gray.\n  * mildconcern: https://www.instagram.com/p/C5jo...\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/C5jo_1bvI0S/?igsh=cW85dnc5czF4Zzg4\n\n  * Mike Masnick: Heh. Yeah, the park we were in had fixed bathrooms (and even cleaned them right after the eclipse so we had clean bathrooms to use before heading out) and a big row of porta potties, but neither ever got crowded. there was a *good* sized crowd but never got crowded\n  * The one thing we didn't really have where we were was a good view of the 360 degree sunset. I remember that from the last one we saw. but didn't really see it this time due to trees around the park.\n  * You should have driven over to where we were! No traffic, very few clouds.\n  * mildconcern: yeah I did not have as good a view of the 360 as I did in Casper Wyoming. It was pretty good and you got a sense of it because we were on a lakeshore but the other angles were mountains\n  * John Roddy: Unfortunately, I had a dentist appointment at just barely after the right time. :/\n  * Which is the only reason I'm able to eat anything again.\n  * Mike Masnick: we really lucked out in 2017, because we found this random hill in the middle of absolute nowhere, eastern oregon, that gave us a 360 degrees view of NOTHING but fields from the top. It was a perfect spot to watch\n  * John Roddy: They had to try like 20 different times to get the right set of x-rays.\n  * Mike Masnick: Yikes.\n  * John Roddy: So I'm expecting to grow a second tongue within the next few days or something.\n  * Interestingly, x-ray tech has finally been miniaturized enough that the camera is entirely handheld now.\n  * The tube just has a really thick glass shield lining the end of it, presumably lined with lead.\n  * deadspatula: Fascinatingly, the big advancement has been in better dosing, not simply the size of components. The big machines needed a big burst and leaked a lot of x-rays. That's why the dentist had to hide behind the lead wall and we covered the reproductive organs - the dose wasn't bad once every six months, but multiple times a day would be serious. And the units therefore needed to be mounted. The handheld units better direct a much lower dose, and manufacturers claim technicians do not get dangerous doses of stray x-rays. That said, the notable property of x-rays is penetration. Many of the units I've seen have a guard as you describe, but nothing opaque, and if its not opaque its not lined with enough lead to matter.\n  * John Roddy: Lead lined glass is almost certainly more than enough to at least scatter any stray x-rays that find their way back.\n  * But yeah, x-ray tech in general got a pretty significant overhaul in the past decade or so.\n  * When Chandra launched in '99, it was the heaviest payload the shuttle ever carried.\n  * Fast forward to '21, and we've got IXPE.\n  * Chandra is close to 6,000kg.\n  * IXPE is just over 300.\n  * mildconcern: I wonder how much the general advancement of detectors driven by the cell phone camera revolution has spilled over. That certainly has helped the field of astronomical detection quite a bit.\n  * Digital sensors that had laughable resolution used to cost a fortune in the 1990s when they started to come out. And now you can get miracle devices for far less.\n  * John Roddy: Cell phone stuff is all in the microwave range.\n  * That's most useful for detecting the cosmic microwave background, which is probably the closest thing to a natural encyclopedia we're ever going to get.\n  * mildconcern: phone cameras also do sense visual light\n  * John Roddy: I feel like everyone I tell this to is hearing it for the first time, but...\n  * I *thought* it was common knowledge that your phone camera is pretty good at seeing infrared too.\n  * It's a really quick and easy way to check if a remote control is working.\n  * Infrared LEDs *will* be visible through the sensor.\n  * mildconcern: Oh yeah I knew that, I was just being a wiseass\n  * it's not hugely far in the infrared spectrum\n  * can't use it as a heat detector or something. Just a smidge.\n  * but I'm mostly saying in terms of astronomy applications. The overall success in designing sensors and detectors in smaller scales has hugely helped anyway\n  * no matter the wavelengths\n  * John Roddy: Yeah, the interesting stuff requires some pretty intense tech.\n  * Almost everything glows in the infrared spectrum, after all.\n  * mildconcern: It's a big part of why they stuck the JWT in space\n  * since it's mostly working in that range\n  * John Roddy: That's only half the story\n  * Spritzer needed some pretty extreme shielding too.\n  * Except the tech wasn't *quite* ready to make the active cooling reliable enough.\n  * A lot of people think of \"cold\" in terms of what chilly weather feels like on earth.\n  * The cold air sucks the heat right out of you.\n  * But space doesn't have that air.\n  * So despite space being extremely cold, it's actually really hard to cool things down out there.\n  * The reason the space shuttle always had the bay doors open in orbit is because that's where the radiators were.\n  * mildconcern: yeah. but the IR wavelengfths that JWT are detecting can't even get through at all even in Earth orbit\n  * so that's why it's out at the Lagrange Point\n  * Despite the \"can't fuck this one up and fix it later\" nature of that as opposed to Hubble\n  * John Roddy: It's not even *at* the Lagrange point\n  * It's in an orbit around it\n  * Samuel Abram: I took a screencap of a thread on facebook, to illustrate the necessity of checkmarks as verification and not a marker of a paid status.\n  * Unfortunately, I can't upload it here\n  * [link]\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/17P1ICo5rwQcW4dnkY8KSX8XzdIXoSQZN/view?usp=drive_link\n\n  * John Roddy: Wow. I legit didn't even realize Lowery was still alive.\n  * He was a grumpy old man last time I encountered him years and years ago, after all.\n  * Mike Masnick: Yes, but he's just asking people to be more \"genuinely empathetic\" like the time he suggested I should get cancer and die in a fire.\n  * John Roddy: I don't know. His decision to back up the guy who compared Brian to Hitler kinda seems to undermine that a bit.\n  * mildconcern: \"Following that were screenshots of tweets (or whatever the fuck)\".

Yeah. I had sent that to @Tim Cushing earlier to check out. Hilarious.\n  * mildconcern: I wonder if Paxton'll retaliate against Elon and make him keep shopping for a state to reincorporate Tesla in\n  * John Roddy: Also I'm banned from submitting any community notes, apparently.\n  * As is anyone else who ever said the word \"cis\" in any context.\n  * candescence: I swear, Elon is the peak example of white male fragility\n  * Samuel Abram: So I guess you could never talk about Transalpine Gaul and [redacted]alpine Gaul, right?\n  * BentFranklin: ...or be a chemist\n  * mildconcern: or the loose trade alliance of former USSR republics\n  * Mike Masnick: interesting article about kagi, given we were just talking about it...
