As the war in Ukraine has shown, EW tactics are evolving faster\nthan ever \u2014 a cat and mouse game of sensing and dodging, disruption and\nadaptation, in the spectrum \u2014 with updates to EW and threat systems now\nhappening over shorter timelines of weeks, days, or even hours. The next\ngeneration of EW systems must enable real-time understanding of the spectrum,\nand provide rapid delivery of effective countermeasures against known and new\nthreats, across domains and modalities.\n\nThat is precisely what Pulsar does.\n\nPulsar-V mounted onto a tactical vehicle.\n\nPulsar integrates a software-defined radio, graphics processing unit, and\nadditional diverse compute into a compact and powerful capability that enables\nradio frequency machine learning (RFML) to rapidly identify and adapt to\nemerging threats at the edge. The system supports a range of capabilities as a\nmulti-mission EW solution, including electronic countermeasures, counter-\nunmanned systems, electronic support, electronic attack, direction finding,\ngeolocation, and other advanced EW capabilities. Pulsar\u2019s modular form factor\ncan also be adapted and integrated onto ground vehicles (Pulsar-V) or aircraft\n(Pulsar-A) to support distributed EW operations across multiple domains.\n\nPulsar is a system that is fundamentally unique and superior to all other\ntactical EW systems currently available. It provides the capability to\nintelligently and autonomously interrogate a wider range of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum, both for known threats and anomalous events, while\nreducing the time to deploy new EW effects to a matter of hours and days.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been developing our Pulsar family of systems to support operational\ndeployments worldwide, including to combat zones, since 2020,\u201d said Sam El-\nAkkad, General Manager of RF/EW Systems at Anduril. \u201cBuilt to survive and win\nin highly-congested and contested electromagnetic environments, Pulsar enables\nwarfighters to counter state and non-state actors employing EW capabilities\nintegrated with other advanced technological systems operating across the\nelectromagnetic spectrum and cyberspace domain.\u201d\n\nPulsar-A payload integrated onto Ghost-X.\n\nPulsar\u2019s open architecture enables integrations into common and joint EW and\ncommand-and-control systems to create a unified network of EW capabilities,\nproviding more comprehensive coverage and coordinated effects across\ndistributed operations. It also provides a software development kit that\nenables continuous development and integrations with third-party providers and\nrapid integration of best-of-breed capabilities in order to keep pace with new\nthreats and missions.\n\nPulsar is an agile software-defined EW system that can swiftly adapt to\nchanging threats and mission needs in all domains for dynamic operations of\ntoday and tomorrow.\n\n### Related Articles\n\n### 4/29/2024\n\n### Anduril Announces Menace-X for Mobile, Distributed Command and Control\n\nRead More\n\n### 12/11/2023\n\n### Anduril's Menace-X demonstrates AI-enabled rapid targeting solution at\nMarine exercise\n\nRead More\n\n### 4/24/2024\n\n### Anduril Selected for U.S. Air Force Collaborative Combat Aircraft Program\n\nRead More\n\nAnduril\n\n### About Us\n\n  * Mission\n  * Careers\n  * Leadership\n  * Newsroom\n  * Blog\n  * Media\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Instagram\n\n### Capabilities\n\n  * Counter UAS\n  * Counter Intrusion\n  * Maritime Counter Intrusion\n\n### Products\n\n  * ALTIUS\n  * Anvil\n  * Command & Control\n  * Dive-LD\n  * Fury\n  * Ghost\n  * Iris\n\n  * Menace\n  * Mission Autonomy\n  * Pulsar\n  * Roadrunner\n  * Sentry\n  * Solid Rocket Motors\n  * WISP\n\n### Contact UsCopy email\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Anduril Industries\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Modern Anti-Slavery Policy\n\n", "frontpage": true}
