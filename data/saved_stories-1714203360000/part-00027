I knew this\nwas a big topic, but I had no idea how big.\n\nAs it turned out, this project kept me busy for the next 25 years.\n\nI was crazy to do this. I was trying to understand the role of music in human\nlife going back to prehistoric times, and hoped to follow its evolution until\nthe present day. This demanded intense multidisciplinary research at a scope\nbeyond anything I\u2019d attempted before.\n\nNobody wanted me to take on this mission. In fact, I\u2019ve never faced such\nresistance in anything I\u2019ve ever done.\n\nEvery publisher and editor I met during that period asked me to write about\njazz\u2014because my book The History of Jazz was a big seller and they wanted\nanother book just like it.\n\nWhen I tried to enlist their support for my bigger project, speaking in\nrapturous terms about music as a source of enchantment and change agent in\nhuman life, their eyes glazed over.\n\nThey didn\u2019t want to hear it.\n\n####\n\nIf you want to support my work, the best way is by taking out a premium\nsubscription (for just $6 per month).\n\nBut I was persistent. This project was my obsession, and my motivation kept\ngetting recharged\u2014because I was learning things about music that other experts\nhad missed.\n\nMost of my breakthroughs came through sheer perseverance, and relentless\ndigging into primary sources (usually outside of the music field) that my\npeers had never even considered consulting.\n\nEven today, I reap benefits from this intense work. I gained a deep\nunderstanding of how culture impacts actual flesh-and-blood people\u2014that\u2019s the\ncore of my expertise. I often draw on it for what I publish on The Honest\nBroker.\n\nBut it took me fifteen years before I was ready to share the first results of\nthis massive research project\u2014Work Songs (2006) and Healing Songs (2006).\nAlmost a decade elapsed before I was ready to publish the final installment of\nthis trilogy, Love Songs (2015). These works, encompassing the entire history\nof human song, prepared me to write Music: A Subversive History (2019).\n\nI believe this is the core of my life\u2019s work.\n\nThe book I\u2019m currently publishing in installments on Substack, Music to Raise\nthe Dead, is the culmination of this enormous endeavor. It presents nothing\nless than an alternative musicology\u2014a powerful way of transforming songs into\nsources of enchantment and a life-changing force for individuals, communities,\nand entire societies.\n\nI\u2019ve learned many things during the course of this work, but one of the most\nsurprising relates to how musical innovations take place.\n\nI repeatedly encountered exciting new song styles emerging in port cities,\nborder regions, and the fringes of society\u2014both geographical fringes and poor\nfringe population groups.\n\nThe best known examples come from the Americas. The dominance of US commercial\nmusic in the last hundred years relies, to an extraordinary degree, on African\nAmericans. Their contributions led directly to jazz, blues, soul, hiphop, R&B,\nAfro-Cuban music, and a range of other important idioms.\n\nPut simply, the most impoverished, marginalized people had the greatest impact\non the music.\n\nI always just took that for granted. But it\u2019s surprising, no?\n\nJazz went mainstream in the 1920s, but originated with African-American\ninnovators\n\nIn the course of my research, I kept encountering the same influence of the\noutsider. I found it everywhere from the emergence of secular songs in Deir\nel-Medina in ancient Egypt to the rise of tango in Buenos Aires or reggae in\nJamaica.\n\nThe outsider is everywhere in music history.\n\nConsider, for example, the names of the musical modes\u2014something else I long\ntook for granted. They are named after population groups, but who were the\nAeolians, the Lydians, and the Phrygians?\n\nThey were slave groups, conquered by the Greeks in Asia Minor. The Greeks also\nnamed some modes after themselves, but the more unusual or controversial modes\nwere associated with slave musicians.\n\nThey don\u2019t teach you this in music school.\n\nSo the next time you hear somebody talk about the building blocks of Western\nharmony, show them the map below. It\u2019s not as Western as they think.\n\nThey will see that a dialogue between insiders and outsiders was shaping\nEuropean music long before Europe even existed as a concept.\n\nNow let\u2019s examine the origin of the Western lyric song. The most significant\ninnovator in the history of this idiom is Sappho, a singer-songwriter (if I\ncan use the current-day terminology) who lived on the island Lesbos, circa 600\nBC.\n\nBut Lesbos is on the absolute fringe of Europe, and is even today an entry\npoint into the continent from West Asia. In 2015 alone, a half million\nmigrants from Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq arrived on Lesbos.\n\nRefugees on a boat heading toward Lesbos, 2016 (Source: Wikimedia Commons)\n\nIt\u2019s safe to assume that Lesbos was also home to a diverse population in\nSappho\u2019s day, with strong ties to West Asian musical traditions.\n\nYou might say that Lesbos is like New Orleans, where jazz originated. The\ningredients for innovation were the same in both instances:\n\n  * Located at a port on a major trade route\n\n  * At a border point or boundary between countries/cultures\n\n  * Boasting a diverse, multicultural population\n\nNew Orleans was the most diverse city in the United States at the time when\njazz emerged. The population drew from Europe, Africa, the Caribbean, and\nLatin America\u2014and this diversity was further supported by a constant flow of\ntrade and visitors via the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n> ## \u201cCultural historians rarely pay attention to water, but they really\n> should.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that jazz happened here. This is precisely the kind of\ncity where new musical styles evolve.\n\nBut let\u2019s go back to Europe\u2014because the story gets more interesting.\n\nThe most significant innovation in Western love songs after Sappho came from\nthe French troubadours during the late medieval era. But how much of this\nmusic originated in France?\n\nI was shocked to learn, during the course of researching my book Love Songs,\nthat this deeply personal approach to singing about romantic love actually\noriginated in Baghdad among female slave singers\u2014slaves again as song\ninnovators! And it only entered Europe via Spain after the Muslim conquest of\nthe Iberian Peninsula.\n\nFrom there, the song styles came to the south of France, and then got\ndisseminated throughout Europe. The French nobility took all of the credit,\nand most books still present the story from that perspective. But in reality,\ninnovation took place at the fringes, and entered Europe via outsiders.\n\nI\u2019ve written elsewhere about C\u00f3rdoba, which had the largest population of any\nEuropean city in the 11th century. That surprises many people\u2014but C\u00f3rdoba had\nmore people than London, Rome, and Paris combined.\n\nTake a guess at answering this question: What were the five most populous\ncities in Europe in the year 1050 AD?\n\nYou\u2019re in for a shock. Here\u2019s the list:\n\nLet\u2019s put those cities on a map.\n\nThis is where secular culture emerged in Europe, laying the foundation for\nWestern humanism and the Renaissance. But you\u2019re gazing at Palermo and\nscratching your head.\n\nYet it\u2019s true: Palermo had a population ten times as large as Rome back then.\n\nI need to emphasize this point: the exciting centers of European culture\nduring its formative years were port cities, or borderlands, or other\nmulticultural centers. Innovation came into Europe from outsiders, especially\nvia the Mediterranean and Adriatic seas.\n\nJust stop and think for a moment about the importance of Venice in the history\nof music. Everything from madrigals to operas found their home in that\nbustling port city\u2014a key connecting point between West and East in the modern\nimagination.\n\nAnd what about Rome? In ancient times, Rome had been a dominant source of\nculture and innovation\u2014but that only happened when all roads led to Rome (as\nthe proverb goes). When Rome was a diverse, multicultural center, it exerted\nenormous influence. But when it lost its allure as a destination for\noutsiders, during the medieval era, Rome stagnated.\n\nRome later regained its luster. But that only happened when a new influx of\noutsiders showed up there. The same is true of Paris, London, Vienna, etc.\n\nI\u2019m focusing on music here, but the same forces shaped innovations in\nliterature. For example, the sonnet\u2014which we all associate with Petrarch and\nShakespeare\u2014actually originated in Sicily. It started on the fringes of\nEurope, and then migrated inland.\n\nAnd if I had time, I could discuss how religious movements always entered\nEurope from outside\u2014all those Roman mystery cults came from other countries\nand cultures. Even Christiantiy\u2014which many people view as emblematic of\nEuropean culture\u2014arrived in Rome from West Asia.\n\nThis is the truth about Western culture nobody wants to tell you. People treat\nit like a monolithic system of established elites, but the exact opposite is\ntrue.\n\nLet me lay it out for you:\n\n  1. Western culture only thrived because it drew on diverse outsiders.\n\n  2. The major sources of innovation are often located on the fringes of the Western world, because this is where outside influences enter the system.\n\n  3. Cultural historians rarely pay attention to water, but they really should. For example, the Mediterranean was a huge force in innovation and cultural transmission, but rarely shows up in your typical Western culture class.\n\n  4. The most innovative cities are also the most diverse, and not because diversity is a popular political slogan, but due to the simple fact that we evolve as a species by sharing and learning among others with different backgrounds.\n\n  5. Poor, disadvantaged groups have a huge impact on this process, because they make up a significant portion of the population in these borderlands. These include migrants, exiles, slaves, and other marginalized communities.\n\n  6. Given this process, even the term Western culture is misleading\u2014because so much of it came from outside the West, strictly defined.\n\n  7. But this isn\u2019t a flaw in the system. It\u2019s actually a great strength. A culture that can assimilate the best of outside forces is stronger because of that skill.\n\n  8. I know this is true for music\u2014because I\u2019ve done the research. But we have good reason to believe that other spheres of culture follow a similar pattern.\n\nI share this because I want to defuse some of the hostility to this cultural\nhistory. We don\u2019t need to choose between \u2018Western\u2019 culture and diversity\u2014they\ngo hand-in-hand. The problems begin when we forget that important fact and\nstart living (and thinking) in silos.\n\n### Subscribe to The Honest Broker\n\nBy Ted Gioia \u00b7 Thousands of paid subscribers\n\nA trustworthy guide to music, books, arts, media & culture by Ted Gioia\n\n210\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Western Music Isn't What You Think\n\nwww.honest-broker.com\n\n45\n\nShare\n\n45 Comments\n\nCarmine LeoNotes from a Hermit Monk5 hrs agoEverybody bitches about cultural\nappropriation.
