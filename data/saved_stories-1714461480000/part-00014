The Foundation has a reserves\npolicy which specifies a minimum amount of money we have to keep in our\naccounts. This is so that if there is a significant interruption to our usual\nincome, we can preserve our core operations while we work on new funding\nsources. We\u2019ve now \u201chit the buffers\u201d of this reserves policy, meaning the\nBoard can\u2019t approve any more deficit budgets \u2013 to keep spending at the same\nlevel we must increase our income.One of the board\u2019s top priorities in hiring\nHolly was therefore her experience in communications and fundraising, and\nbuilding broader and more diverse support for our mission and work. Her goals\nsince joining \u2013 as well as building her familiarity with the community and\nproject \u2013 have been to set up better financial controls and reporting, develop\na strategic plan, and start fundraising. You may have noticed the Foundation\nbeing more cautious with spending this year, because Holly prepared a break-\neven budget for the Board to approve in October, so that we can steady the\nship while we prepare and launch our new fundraising initiatives.\n\n# Strategy & Fundraising\n\nThe biggest prerequisite for fundraising is a clear strategy \u2013 we need to\nexplain what we\u2019re doing and why it\u2019s important, and use that to convince\npeople to support our plans. I\u2019m very pleased to report that Holly has been\nworking hard on this and meeting with many stakeholders across the community,\nand has prepared a detailed and insightful five year strategic plan. The plan\ndefines the areas where the Foundation will prioritise, develop and fund\ninitiatives to support and grow the GNOME project and community. The board has\napproved a draft version of this plan, and over the coming weeks Holly and the\nFoundation team will be sharing this plan and running a consultation process\nto gather feedback input from GNOME foundation and community members.In\nparallel, Holly has been working on a fundraising plan to stabilise the\nFoundation, growing our revenue and ability to deliver on these plans. We will\nbe launching a variety of fundraising activities over the coming months,\nincluding a development fund for people to directly support GNOME development,\nworking with professional grant writers and managers to apply for government\nand private foundation funding opportunities, and building better\ncommunications to explain the importance of our work to corporate and\nindividual donors.\n\n# Board Development\n\nAnother observation that Holly had since joining was that we had, by general\nnonprofit standards, a very small board of just 7 directors. While we do have\nsome committees which have (very much appreciated!) volunteers from outside\nthe board, our officers are usually appointed from within the board, and many\nboard members end up serving on multiple committees and wearing several hats.\nIt also means the number of perspectives on the board is limited and less\nrepresentative of the diverse contributors and users that make up the GNOME\ncommunity.Holly has been working with the board and the governance committee\nto reduce how much we ask from individual board members, and improve\nrepresentation from the community within the Foundation\u2019s governance. Firstly,\nthe board has decided to increase its size from 7 to 9 members, effective from\nthe upcoming elections this May & June, allowing more voices to be heard\nwithin the board discussions. After that, we\u2019re going to be working on opening\nup the board to more participants, creating non-voting officer seats to\nrepresent certain regions or interests from across the community, and take\npart in committees and board meetings. These new non-voting roles are likely\nto be appointed with some kind of application process, and we\u2019ll share details\nabout these roles and how to be considered for them as we refine our plans\nover the coming year.\n\n# Elections\n\nWe\u2019re really excited to develop and share these plans and increase the ways\nthat people can get involved in shaping the Foundation\u2019s strategy and how we\nraise and spend money to support and grow the GNOME community. This brings me\nto my final point, which is that we\u2019re in the run up to the annual board\nelections which take place in the run up to GUADEC. Because of the expansion\nof the board, and four directors coming to the end of their terms, we\u2019ll be\nelecting 6 seats this election. It\u2019s really important to Holly and the board\nthat we use this opportunity to bring some new voices to the table, leading by\nexample in growing and better representing our community.Allan wrote in the\npast about what the board does and what\u2019s expected from directors. As you can\nsee we\u2019re working hard on reducing what we ask from each individual board\nmember by increasing the number of directors, and bringing additional members\nin to committees and non-voting roles. If you\u2019re interested in seeing more\ndiverse backgrounds and perspectives represented on the board, I would\nstrongly encourage you consider standing for election and reach out to a board\nmember to discuss their experience.Thanks for reading! Until next time.Best\nWishes, Rob President, GNOME FoundationUpdate 2024-04-27: It was suggested in\nthe Discourse thread that I clarify the interaction between the break-even\nbudget and the 1M EUR committed by the STF project. This money is received in\nthe form of a contract for services rather than a grant to the Foundation, and\nmust be spent on the development areas agreed during the planning and\napplication process. It\u2019s included within this year\u2019s budget (October 23 \u2013\nSeptember 24) and is all expected to be spent during this fiscal year, so it\ndoesn\u2019t have an impact on the Foundation\u2019s reserves position. The Foundation\nretains a small % fee to support its costs in connection with the project,\nincluding the new requirement to have our accounts externally audited at the\nend of the financial year. We are putting this money towards recruitment of an\nadministrative assistant to improve financial and other operational support\nfor the Foundation and community, including the STF project and future\ndevelopment initiatives.(also posted to GNOME Discourse, please head there if\nyou have any questions or comments)posted by ramcq @ 10:39 am Comments (1) .:.\nTrackback .:.
