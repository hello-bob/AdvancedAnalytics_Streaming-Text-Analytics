Any program that works on MS-DOS should also run on FreeDOS.\n\n## Play classic games\n\nYou can play your favorite DOS games on FreeDOS. And there are a lot of great\nclassic games to play: Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Commander Keen, Rise of the\nTriad, Jill of the Jungle, Duke Nukem, and many others!\n\n## Run applications\n\nYou can run your favorite DOS programs with FreeDOS. Or use FreeDOS to run a\nlegacy DOS application. Just install your DOS program under FreeDOS like you\nwould any DOS application and you'll be good to go.\n\n## Create new programs\n\nFreeDOS includes lots of compilers, assemblers, and other programming tools so\nyou can create your own DOS programs. You can also modify FreeDOS itself,\nbecause we include the source code under an open source license.\n\n## What\u2019s New\n\n### USBDDOS\n\n2024-04-20 4:34pm\n\nUSBDDOS is a USB driver stack for DOS. It was originally named RWDDOS before\nreleased to public, which is only a driver for RetroWave OPL3, and later more\ndrviers added (mouse, keyboard, disk) and renamed to USBDDOS. USBDDOS uses\nDPMI to perform PCI bus master DMA (MMIO), and also save conventional memory\nfor other DOS programs. You can find the source code at USBDDOS on GitHub.\n\n### MicroWeb ver 2.0\n\n2024-04-20 4:27pm\n\nMicroWeb is a web browser for DOS that runs as a 16-bit real mode application\nand is designed to run on minimal hardware. Note that this has some\nlimitations, including HTTP only, no JS or CSS, and only supports GIF images.\nMicroWeb 2.0 contains several improvements, such as: + Support for more video\nmodes, including monochrome and colour modes + PNG and JPEG dimensions are\nloaded but not the content + Improved font rendering and better Unicode\nsupport + More HTML tag support. You can download the new version at MicroWeb\nver 2.0 on GitHub.\n\n### VSBHDA version 1.4\n\n2024-04-20 4:25pm\n\nVSBHDA provides SoundBlaster emulation for more modern computers that have HDA\n(and AC97/SBLive); this is a fork of crazii's SBEMU. Version 1.4 add several\nneat features and compatibility fixes, including: + added 16-bit protected-\nmode variant vsbhda16.exe + reworked HDA initialization code + Creative's\ndiagnose.exe accepts vsbhda's SB emulation + DSP cmd 0x91 now handled\ncorrectly + direct DSP cmd 0x10 supported. You can find it at VSBHDA on\nGitHub, or more directly at VSBHDA releases.\n\nAlso: While it's unrelated to VSBHDA, you might be interested in SBDIAG to\ntest SoundBlaster compatible sound cards, such as the Snark Barker for MCA.\n\n### Public domain libm math library 0.7\n\n2024-04-13 11:22am\n\nGregory Pietsch created libm, as a public domain math library for programming.\nGregory writes about the new release: \"For this version, I have worked on edge\ncases regarding complex numbers and dug deep into the C99 Standard.\" Please\nhelp test the library and provide feedback to Gregory, or reply to the\nfreedos-devel email list. You can download the new version from the FreeDOS\nFiles Archive at Ibiblio, under /devel/libs/libm\n\n### FreeDOS videos on YouTube\n\n2024-04-10 9:29am\n\nDid you know FreeDOS has a YouTube channel? The latest videos are about\ngetting people interested in programming, like a program to make a Cylon \"eye\"\nmove back and forth on the screen, and how to write a simple file viewer. We\nhadn't posted videos in a while, but previous videos from before the break\nincluded a comparison of Quattro Pro with a modern spreadsheet, a\ndemonstration of video resolutions on DOS, how to use VIM on FreeDOS, and how\nto install Borland TurboC++ on FreeDOS. The channel also sometimes covers more\ngeneral \"retrocomputing\" topics like a history of tech writing with ed and\nnroff, a look back at original style C, and using Linux like original Unix.\nFor more, subscribe to the FreeDOS YouTube channel.\n\n### Angband 4.2.5 for DOS\n\n2024-03-20 9:59am\n\nIf you like \"dungeon\" style adventure games, you might be interested in\nAngband. Angband is a free, single-player dungeon exploration game, where you\nplay an adventurer seeking riches, fighting monsters, and preparing for a\nfinal battle. Angband is open source software at the Angband website. Ben\nCollver has compiled a DOS version of Angband 4.2.5, which you can download at\narchive.org.\n\nThe FreeDOS Project aims to publish website content under a Creative Commons\nAttribution ShareAlike license.
