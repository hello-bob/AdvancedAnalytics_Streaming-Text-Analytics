We found the optimal amount of sleep was 8.3 hours, while\nfor light activity and moderate to vigorous activity, it was best to get 2.2\nhours each.\n\n## Finding the right balance\n\nCurrent health guidelines recommend you stick to a sensible regime of\nmoderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activity 2.5\u20135 hours per week.\n\nHowever mounting evidence now suggests how you spend your day can have\nmeaningful ramifications for your health. In addition to moderate-to vigorous-\nintensity physical activity, this means the time you spend sitting, standing,\ndoing light physical activity (such as walking around your house or office)\nand sleeping.\n\nOur research looked at more than 2,000 adults who wore body sensors that could\ninterpret their physical behaviours, for seven days. This gave us a sense of\nhow they spent their average 24 hours.\n\nAt the start of the study participants had their waist circumference, blood\nsugar and insulin sensitivity measured. The body sensor and assessment data\nwas matched and analysed then tested against health risk markers \u2014 such as a\nheart disease and stroke risk score \u2014 to create a model.\n\nUsing this model, we fed through thousands of permutations of 24 hours and\nfound the ones with the estimated lowest associations with heart disease risk\nand blood-glucose levels. This created many optimal mixes of sitting,\nstanding, light and moderate intensity activity.\n\nWhen we looked at waist circumference, blood sugar, insulin sensitivity and a\nheart disease and stroke risk score, we noted differing optimal time zones.\nWhere those zones mutually overlapped was ascribed the optimal zone for heart\ndisease and diabetes risk.\n\n## You\u2019re doing more physical activity than you think\n\nWe found light-intensity physical activity (defined as walking less than 100\nsteps per minute) \u2013 such as walking to the water cooler, the bathroom, or\nstrolling casually with friends \u2013 had strong associations with glucose\ncontrol, and especially in people with type 2 diabetes. This light-intensity\nphysical activity is likely accumulated intermittently throughout the day\nrather than being a purposeful bout of light exercise.\n\nOur experimental evidence shows that interrupting our sitting regularly with\nlight-physical activity (such as taking a 3\u20135 minute walk every hour) can\nimprove our metabolism, especially so after lunch.\n\nWhile the moderate-to-vigorous physical activity time might seem a quite high,\nat more than 2 hours a day, we defined it as more than 100 steps per minute.\nThis equates to a brisk walk.\n\nIt should be noted that these findings are preliminary. This is the first\nstudy of heart disease and diabetes risk and the \u201coptimal\u201d 24 hours, and the\nresults will need further confirmation with longer prospective studies.\n\nThe data is also cross-sectional. This means that the estimates of time use\nare correlated with the disease risk factors, meaning it\u2019s unclear whether how\nparticipants spent their time influences their risk factors or whether those\nrisk factors influence how someone spends their time.\n\n## Australia\u2019s adult physical activity guidelines need updating\n\nAustralia\u2019s physical activity guidelines currently only recommend exercise\nintensity and time. A new set of guidelines are being developed to incorporate\n24-hour movement. Soon Australians will be able to use these guidelines to\nexamine their 24 hours and understand where they can make improvements.\n\nWhile our new research can inform the upcoming guidelines, we should keep in\nmind that the recommendations are like a north star: something to head towards\nto improve your health. In principle this means reducing sitting time where\npossible, increasing standing and light-intensity physical activity,\nincreasing more vigorous intensity physical activity, and aiming for a healthy\nsleep of 7.5\u20139 hours per night.\n\nBeneficial changes could come in the form of reducing screen time in the\nevening or opting for an active commute over driving commute, or prioritising\nan earlier bed time over watching television in the evening.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to acknowledge these are recommendations for an able\nadult. We all have different considerations, and above all, movement should be\nfun.\n\n  * Exercise\n  * Physical activity\n  * Health\n  * Health research\n\n### Events\n\nMore events\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * ##### Assistant Editor - 1 year cadetship\n\n  * ##### Program Development Officer - Business Processes\n\n  * ##### Executive Dean, Faculty of Health\n\n  * ##### Lecturer/Senior Lecturer, Earth System Science (School of Science)\n\n  * ##### Sydney Horizon Educators (Identified)\n\nMore jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n\n", "frontpage": true}
