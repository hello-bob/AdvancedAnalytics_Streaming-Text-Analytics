When it\u2019s open, it will be \u201con top\u201d. That alone is\na sick feature. I dislike having to put modals as children of the <body> just\nso they don\u2019t have other elements inescapable stacking contexts to worry\nabout.\n\nSo then how is it different than a <dialog>? Popups are not \u201cmodal\u201d. The web-\nworld definition of modal is that it forces a user to deal with it (the rest\nof the page cannot receive focus, it is inert). Popups just... pop... up. The\nuser is free to do anything else while a popup is open. Dialogs, not so much.\n\nRobin showed off how extremely very easy it is to use:\n\n    \n    \n    <button popovertarget=\"mypopover\">Toggle the popover</button> <div id=\"mypopover\" popover>Popover content</div>Code language: HTML, XML (xml)\n\nThe fact that that\u2019s possible in HTML alone is awfully nice. But of course you\ncan style it with CSS if you like. Plus you get freebies like the fact that\nthey ESC key closes it. Taking it a bit further, here\u2019s an only slightly more\nfleshed out example using other cool freebies like popovertargetaction=\"hide\":\n\n(p.s. I dig the trick of getting a white \u274c with the filter property as shown\nabove. Golf clap.)\n\nRobin goes on to say that the logic for using it is something like this:\n\n>   1. Use title if the content in my popover is just text.\n>   2. Use the popover attribute if the content is more than plain text and\n> like a menu of options or something.\n>   3. Use <dialog> if you need to force the user to make a decision or block\n> all other interactions on the page.\n>\n\nI only disagree on the first one. I think title is pretty useless and I only\ntend to include one if some accessibility tool bitches at me to add one, like\non an <iframe>. The title attribute does nothing on mobile/touch devices or\nscreen readers. You can\u2019t control anything about it, like how it looks, where\nit goes, or how long it takes to show up if it does at all. If we get more\ncontrol over it (which, who knows, we might) then I\u2019d be happy to take another\nlook, but it seems likely it\u2019ll still be a \u201conly use if it\u2019s a just text\u201d\nsituation.\n\nI\u2019m certainly a fan of this API existing, but I do think it\u2019s very hampered\nright now without the Anchor Position API being nearly as well supported.\nMassive use cases like tooltips or flyout menus aren\u2019t really possible without\nit. Una has written about this as well. And good news, it can also be HTML\npowered.\n\n    \n    \n    <button id=\"menu-toggle\" popovertarget=\"menu-items\"> Open Menu </button> <ul id=\"menu-items\" popover anchor=\"menu-toggle\"> <li class=\"item\">...</li> <li class=\"item\">...</li> </ul>Code language: HTML, XML (xml)\n\nNote the anchor attribute there connecting the two elements. So cool. And\nagain, you can take finer grained control with CSS if you\u2019d like. \u201cOpen right\nnext to this other element\u201d is clutch. Heads up though, the anchor attribute\nis not ready yet.\n\n> \ud83d\udea8 PSA for folks with anchor positioning demos: \ud83d\udea8\n>\n> The anchor HTML attribute was removed from the initial launch.\n>\n> You can only set up anchors in CSS now using anchor-name and position-anchor\n> or the anchor-name directly in the anchor() function.\n>\n> \u2014 Una \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 (@Una) April 26, 2024\n\nTaking it futher, here\u2019s another idea from Una that uses an anchor element as\na central position and then moves individual items in a circle around it.\n\nI\u2019ll tell ya, Una is ready with all this! Particularly with the Anchor\nPositioning API, she\u2019s got a bunch of demos and a little helper website to\nmake sure you can declare the positioning CSS you intend:\n\nI now will await patiently the Anchor Positioning API to drop everwhere. Alas,\nPopover was part of interop 2024 where Anchor was not.\n\n### Wanna learn CSS from a course?\n\nFYI, we have a full CSS learning path with multiple courses depending on how\nyou want to approach it.\n\n### 2 responses to \u201cPopover API is Here\u201d\n\n  1. eugene andruszczenko says:\n\nMay 2, 2024 at 3:31 pm\n\nWith animation and ::backdrop\n\nhttps://codepen.io/32teeth/pen/YzMgqQx\n\nReply\n\n     * Chris Coyier says:\n\nMay 3, 2024 at 10:50 am\n\nVery classy.\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\n### Author\n\nChris Coyier\n\nCodePen\n\nI\u2019m a web designer and developer and my career arc is about helping you get\nbetter at those things.
