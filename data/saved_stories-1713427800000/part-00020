Air New Zealand has a firm order for one ALIA, with options for an\nextra two and rights for a further 20.\n\nALIA is capable of speeds up to 270km/h, has reached ranges of 480km in\ntesting, and can be fully charged in 40 to 60 minutes. Air New Zealand plans\nto initially operate it on routes of around 150km, at altitudes of between\n1,500 to 3,000 metres.\n\n\u201cWe are incredibly grateful to both Wellington and Marlborough airports for\nbeing so willing to take on a leadership role in supporting Air New Zealand to\nestablish next generation aircraft capability in our business,\u201d said Air New\nZealand\u2019s chief sustainability officer, Kiri Hannifin.\n\n==\n\n==\n\n\u201cTheir involvement is critical in supporting the infrastructure required to\nfly next-generation aircraft, and they\u2019ll help lead the way in supporting\nairports across Aotearoa to make the changes needed for us to fly larger\nlower-emissions aircraft on our domestic network from 2030.\u201d\n\nDean Heiford, CEO of Marlborough Airport, said the airport is looking forward\nto trialling the \u201cnext generation of aviation technology\u201d.\n\n\u201cDecarbonising aviation is of global importance, and in New Zealand\nmaintaining regional connectivity through this transition is of national\nimportance,\u201d he said.\n\nVIEW ALL\n\nCharting tomorrow\u2019s aviation landscape today\n\n\u201cThis is a big step for us on our own sustainability journey that we wouldn\u2019t\nhave been able to achieve without partnership. We\u2019re looking forward to\nsharing our learnings with other regional airports across New Zealand.\n\n\u201cHosting the demonstrator with Wellington will further cement Marlborough as\nan important hub to keep New Zealand connected across the Cook Strait.\u201d\n\nAir New Zealand\u2019s plans are on a similar schedule to Queensland regional\ncarrier Skytrans, which wants to fly hydrogen-powered commercial planes by\n2026, and Rex, which wants to retrofit electric engines to Saab 340 planes\nwithin the same timescale.\n\nThe carrier also this week announced a purchase of nine million litres of\nsustainable aviation fuel for its jet operations.\n\nNews\n\n0 comment\n\n##### Jake Nelson\n\nprevious post Air New Zealand buys 9 million litres of sustainable fuel\n\nYou need to be a member to post comments.
