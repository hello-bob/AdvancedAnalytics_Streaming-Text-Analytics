Business acquisitions are common but often\nshrouded in mystery because they happen behind closed doors. In this article,\nYaakov details the story of his company and the journey it took him on,\nshedding light on the process of selling a business and what he learned from\nthe experience.\n\nAugust 2021 marks a milestone for me. That\u2019s when we signed an acquisition\nagreement to sell Chatra, a profitable live chat platform. I co-founded it\nafter shutting down my first startup after a six-year struggle. Chatra took me\nand the team six years to finish \u2014 that\u2019s six years of learning,\nexperimenting, sometimes failing, and ultimately winning big.\n\nAcquisitions happen all the time. But what does it look like to go through\none, putting the thing you built and nurtured up for sale and ceding control\nto someone else to take over? Sometimes, these things are complicated and\ncontain clauses about what you can and can\u2019t say after the transaction is\ncompleted.\n\nSo, I\u2019ve curated a handful of the most valuable takeaways from starting,\ngrowing, and selling the company. It took me some time to process everything;\nsome lessons were learned immediately, while others took time to sink in.\nUltimately, though, it\u2019s a recollection of my personal journey. I hope sharing\nit can help you in the event you ever find yourself in a similar pair of\nshoes.\n\n## Keeping The Band Together\n\nRewind six years before the Chatra acquisition. My first startup, Getwear, ran\nout of steam, and I \u2014 along with everyone else \u2014 was ready to jump ship.\n\nBut we weren\u2019t ready to part ways. My co-founder-partner was a close childhood\nfriend with whom I would sell pirated CDs in the late 90s. Now, I don\u2019t think\nit\u2019s the most honest way to make a living, but it didn\u2019t bother us much in\nhigh school. It also contributed to a strong bond between us, one that led to\nthe launch of Getwear and, later, Chatra.\n\nThat partnership and collaboration were too precious to let go; we knew that\nour work wasn\u2019t supposed to end at Getwear and that we\u2019d have at least one\nmore try together. The fact that we struggled together before is what allowed\nus to pull through difficult times later. Our friendship allowed us to work\nthrough stress, difficulties, and the unavoidable disagreements that always\ncome up.\n\nThat was a big lesson for me: It\u2019s good to have a partner you trust along for\nthe ride. We were together before Chatra, and we saw it all the way through to\nthe end. I can\u2019t imagine how things would have been different had I partnered\nwith someone new and unfamiliar, or worse, on my own.\n\nMeet Smashing Email Newsletter with useful tips on front-end, design & UX.\nSubscribe and get \u201cSmart Interface Design Checklists\u201d \u2014 a free PDF deck with\n150+ questions to ask yourself when designing and building almost anything.\n\nOnce a week.

So when it failed, that\nmotivation effectively evaporated. We were no longer inspired to take on\nambitious plans, but we still had enough steam to start a digital analog of a\nd\u00f6ner kebab shop \u2014 a simple, sought-after tech product just to pay our bills.\n\nThis business wasn\u2019t to be built on the back of investment capital; no, it was\nbootstrapped. That means we made do with a small, independent, fully-remote\nteam. Remember, this is in 2015. The global pandemic had yet to happen, and a\nfully remote team was still a novelty. And it was quite a change from how we\nran Getwear, which was stocked with an R&D department, a production office,\nand even a factory in Mumbai. A small distributed team seemed the right\napproach to keep us nimble as we set about defining our path forward as a\ncompany.\n\nFinding our purpose required us to look at the intersection of what the market\nneeds and what we know and can do well. Building a customer support product\nwas an obvious choice: at Getwear, we heavily relied on live chat to help\nusers take their body measurements and place their orders.\n\nWe were familiar with existing products on the market. Besides, we already had\nexperience building a conversational support product: we had built an internal\ntool to facilitate communication between our Mumbai-based factory and an\noverseas customer-facing team. The best thing about that was that it was built\non a relatively obscure framework offering real-time messaging out of the box.\n\nThere were maybe 20 established competitors in the space back in 2015, but\nthat didn\u2019t dissuade us. If there was enough room for 20 products to do\nbusiness, there must be enough for 21. I assumed we should treat competition\nas a market validation rather than an obstacle.\n\nLooking back, I can confidently say that it\u2019s totally possible to compete (and\nsucceed) in a crowded market.\n\nProduct-wise, Getwear was very innovative; no one had ever built an online\njeans customizer as powerful as ours. We designed the UX from scratch without\nrelying much on the best practices.\n\nWith Chatra, we went down a completely different route: We had improved the\nestablished live chat product category via features that were, at that time,\ncommonly found in other types of software but hadn\u2019t made their way to our\nfield. That was the opportunity we seized.\n\nThe existing live chat platforms felt archaic in that the interfaces were\nclunky and reminiscent of Windows 95, the user flows were poorly thought out,\nand the dated user experience resulted in lost conversation histories.\n\nSlack was a new product at this time and was all the rage with its fresh\napproach to user interfaces and conversational onboarding. Products like\nFacebook Messenger and Telegram (which is popular in Eastern Europe and the\nMiddle East) were already standard bearers and formed user expectations for\nhow a messaging experience should work on mobile. We learned a lot from these\nproducts and found in them the blueprint to design a modern chat widget and\ndashboard for agents.\n\nWe certainly stood on the shoulders of giants, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with\nstealing like an artist: in fact, both Steve Jobs and Bill Gates did it.\n\nThe takeaway?\n\n> A product does not have to be new to redefine and disrupt a market. It\u2019s\n> possible to lead by introducing modern standards and designs rather than\n> coming up with something radically different.\n>\n> \u201c\n\n## Making A Go-To-Market Strategy\n\nOnce we were clear about what we were building and how to build it, the time\ncame to figure out a strategy for bringing our product to market.\n\nTwo things were very clear and true to us up front:\n\n  1. We needed to launch and start earning immediately \u2014 in months rather than years \u2014 being a bootstrapped company and all.\n  2. We didn\u2019t have money for things like paid acquisition, brand awareness, or outbound sales representatives to serve as the front line for customer engagement.\n\nBoth conclusions, taken together, helped us decide to focus our efforts on\nsmall businesses that need fewer features in a product and onboard by self-\nservice. Marketing-wise, that meant we\u2019d need to find a way around\nprohibitively expensive ads.\n\nEnter growth hacking! The term doesn\u2019t resonate now the way it did in 2015:\nfresh, aggressive, and effective. As a user-facing website widget, we had a\nbuilt-in acquisition channel by way of a \u201cpowered by Chatra\u201d link. For it to\nbe an effective marketing tool, we had to accumulate a certain number of\ncustomers. Otherwise, who\u2019s going to see the link in the first place?\n\nWe combined unorthodox techniques to acquire new customers, like web-scraping\nand email address discovery with cold outreach.\n\n> Initially, we decided to go after our competitors\u2019 customers. But the only\n> thing we got out of targeting them with emails was their rightful anger.\n>\n> \u201c\n\nIn fact, a number of customers complained directly to the competitors, and the\nCEO of a prominent live chat company demanded we cease communicating with\ntheir users.\n\nMore than that, he actually requested that we donate to a well-known civil\nliberty NGO, something we wholeheartedly agreed to, considering it was indeed\nthe right thing to do.\n\nSo, we decided to forget about competition and target potential customers (who\nowned e-commerce websites) using automation for lead research, email sending,\nand reply processing. We managed to do it on a massive scale with very few\nresources. By and large, cold outreach has been the single most effective\nmarketing tool we have ever used. And contrary to common assumption, it is not\na practice reserved purely for enterprise products.\n\nOnce we acquired a significant user mass, the widget link became our Number\nOne acquisition channel. In lean startup terminology, a viral engine of growth\nis a situation when existing customers start generating leads and filling the\nmarketing funnel for you. It\u2019s where we all want to be, but the way to get\nthere is often murky and unreliable. But my experience tells me that it is\npossible and can be planned.\n\nFor this strategy to work, it has to be based on natural user interactions.\nWith widgets, the mechanic is quite apparent, but not so much with other\nproducts. Still, you can do well with serious planning and running experiments\nto help make informed decisions that achieve the best possible results.\n\nFor example, we were surprised that the widget link performed way better in\ntests when we changed it from \u201cPowered by Chatra\u201d to \u201cGet Chatra!\u201d. We\u2019re\ntalking big increases with minor tweaks. The small details really do matter!\n\nContent marketing was another avenue we explored for generating leads. We had\nalready done the cold outreach and had a good viral engine going with the\nwidget link. Content marketing, in contrast, was an attempt to generate leads\nat the \u201ctop\u201d of the funnel, independent of any outbound marketing or our\ncustomers\u2019 websites. We produced books and guides that were well-researched,\nwritten, and designed to bring in potential customers while supporting\nexisting ones with resources to get the most out of Chatra.\n\nSadly, these efforts failed to attract many new leads. I don\u2019t want to say not\nto invest in quality content; it\u2019s just that this is not a viable short-term\ngrowth strategy.\n\n## Increasing Lifetime Customer Value\n\nIt took six months of development to launch and another year to finally break\neven. By then, we had achieved a product-market fit with consistent organic\ngrowth; it was time to focus on metrics and unit economics. Our challenge was\nto limit customer churn and find ways to increase the lifetime value of\nexisting customers.\n\nIf there\u2019s an arch-enemy to SaaS, it\u2019s churn. Mitigating churn is crucial to\nany subscription business, as longer subscriptions generate more revenue.\nPlus, it\u2019s easier to prevent churn than it is to acquire new customers.\n\nWe found it helpful to distinguish between avoidable churn and unavoidable\n(i.e., \u201cnatural\u201d) churn. The latter concerns customer behavior beyond our\ncontrol: if an e-commerce store shuts down, they won\u2019t pay for services. And\nwe had nothing to do with them shutting down \u2014 it\u2019s just the reality of life\nthat most small businesses fail. No quick-fix strategy could ever change that;\nwe just had to deal with it.\n\nChatra\u2019s subscription pricing was fairly inexpensive, yet we enjoyed a\nrelatively high customer lifetime value (cLTV). Many customers tended to stay\nfor a long time \u2014 some, for years. Our high cLTV helped us justify higher\ncustomer acquisition costs (CAC) for paid ads in the Shopify app store once we\ndecided to run them. Running the ads allowed us to improve our Shopify app\nstore search position. And because of that, we improved and kept our position\nas a top app within our category. That, I believe, was one of the factors that\nthe company Brevo considered when they later decided to acquire our business.\n\nWe tried improving the free-to-paid subscription conversion rate by targeting\nthose who actively used the product but remained on a free plan for an\nextended period. We offered them an upgraded plan subscription for just one\ndollar per year. And to our surprise, that failed to convince many people to\nupgrade. We were forced to conclude that there are two types of customers:\nthose who pay and those who do not (and will not).\n\nFrom that point forward, things got even weirder. For example, we ran several\nexperiments with subscription pricing and found that we could increase\nsubscription prices from $11 per seat to $19 without adversely affecting\neither the visitor-to-user or the free-to-paid conversion rates! Apparently,\nprice doesn\u2019t matter as much as you might think. It\u2019s possible to raise prices\nwithout adversely affecting conversions, at least in our experience with a\nfreemium pricing model.\n\nWe also released additional products we could cross-sell to existing\ncustomers. One was Livebar, an app for in-browser notifications on recent\nonline shopping purchases. Another was Yeps, a simple announcement bar that\nsticks to the top of a webpage. Product-wise, both were good. But despite our\nefforts to bring awareness to them in all our communications with Chatra\ncustomers, they never really took off. We\u2019ve closed the first and sold the\nsecond for a price that barely justified the development and ongoing support\nwe were putting into it. We were wrong to assume that if we have a loyal\naudience, we could automatically sell them another product.\n\n## Contemplating An Exit\n\nChatra was a lean company. As a SaaS business, we had a perfect cost-revenue\nratio and gained new customers mainly through viral dynamics and self-\nonboarding. These didn\u2019t increase our costs much but did indeed bring in extra\nsubscription dollars. The engine worked almost without any effort on our side.\n\nAfter a few years, the company could mostly function on auto-pilot, giving us\n\u2014 the founders \u2014 time and resources to pay our bills and run business\nexperiments. We were enjoying a good life. Our work was a success!\n\nWe gave up on an exit strategy even before starting, so we didn\u2019t pay much\nattention to the acquisition offers we routinely received; most weren\u2019t\nenticing enough to pull us away. Even those sent by people known in the\nindustry were way too small: the best offer we got was a valuation of 2.5\ntimes our Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), which was a non-starter for us.\n\nThen, we received an email with another offer. The details were slim, but we\ndecided to at least entertain the idea and schedule a time to chat. I replied\nthat we wouldn\u2019t consider anything lower than an industry-standard venture-\nbacked SaaS valuation (which was about eight times ARR at the time). The\nresponse, surprisingly, read: \u201cLet\u2019s talk. Are you ready to sign a non-\ndisclosure agreement?\u201d\n\nMy biggest concern was that transferring ownership might lead to the Chatra\nteam being laid off and the product termination. I didn\u2019t want to let down our\nexisting customers! The buyer understood the situation and assured us that\nChatra would remain a separate line of business, at least for an extended\nperiod. No one on the team would lose their job. The buyer also planned to\nfork Chatra rather than close it, at least initially.\n\nStill, letting go of it was difficult, and at times, I even felt the urge to\nblow up the negotiations.\n\nSo, why sell at all? We did it for three reasons:\n\n  * First, we felt stuck in the mature stage of the business lifecycle and missed the feeling of creating new things.\n  * Second, we (rightfully) knew that the good times could not last forever; we would be wise to avoid putting all our eggs in one basket.\n  * Third was a bit of pride. I genuinely wanted to go through the acquisition process, which has always seemed like a rite of passage for entrepreneurs.\n\nChatra was growing, cash-flow positive, and economic tailwinds seemed to blow\nour way. On the flip side, however, we had little left to do as founders. We\ndidn\u2019t want to go upmarket and compete with massive players like Intercom and\nDrift. We were happy in our niche, but it didn\u2019t offer enough growth or\nexpansion opportunities. We felt near the end of the line.\n\nLooking back, I see how fortunate we were. The market took a huge hit soon\nafter the acquisition, to the extent that I\u2019m sure we would not have been able\nto fetch equally enticing offers within the next two years.\n\nI want to stress that the offer we got was very, very generous. Still I often\nkick myself for not asking for more, as a deep-pocketed buyer is unlikely to\nturn away simply because we were trying to increase the company\u2019s valuation.\nThe additional ask would have been negligible to the buyer, but it could have\nbeen very meaningful for us.\n\nDifferent acquisitions wind up looking different in the end. If you\u2019re curious\nwhat a transaction looks like, ours was split into three payouts:\n\n  1. An initial, fixed payment on the closing date;\n  2. Several flexible payouts based on reaching post-acquisition milestones;\n  3. An escrow amount deposited with an escrow agent for the possibility of something going wrong, like legal claims.\n\nWe assumed this structure was non-negotiable and didn\u2019t try to agree on a\ndifferent distribution that would move more money to the initial payment. Why?\nWe were too shy to ask and were sure we\u2019d complete all requirements on time.\nAccepting a significant payment delay essentially credited the buyer for the\namount of the payouts while leaving me and my co-founder vulnerable to\nuncertainty.\n\nWe should\u2019ve been bold and negotiated more favorable terms. After all, it\nrepresented the last time we\u2019d have to battle for Chatra. I consider that a\nlesson learned for next time.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nParting ways with Chatra wasn\u2019t easy. The team became my second family, and\nevery product pixel and bit of code was dear to my heart. And yes, I do still\nfeel nostalgia for it from time to time. But I certainly enjoy the freedom\nthat comes with the financial gains.\n\nOne thing I absolutely want to mention before closing this out is that\n\n> Having an \u201cexit\u201d under my belt actually did very little to change my\n> personal well-being or sense of self-worth. The biggest lesson I took away\n> from the acquisition is that success is the process of doing things, not the\n> point you can arrive at.\n>\n> \u201c\n\nI don\u2019t yet know where the journey will take me from here, but I\u2019m confident\nthat there will be both a business challenge and a way of helping others on\ntheir own founder journey. That said, I sincerely hope that my experience\ngives you a good deal of insight into the process of selling a company. It\u2019s\none of those things that often happens behind closed doors. But by shedding a\nlittle light on it \u2014 at least this one reflection \u2014 perhaps you will be more\nprepared than I was and know what to look for.\n\n(gg, yk)\n\nExplore more on\n\n#### Smashing Newsletter\n\nTips on front-end & UX, delivered weekly in your inbox.
