Discovering his paper \u201cIt from Bit\u201d was definitely\na huge inspiration for me to get into the field. When I found Wheeler\u2019s paper\nit led me to Bill Wootters work, and I immediately charged my parents hundreds\nof dollars to get a copy of very paper Bill had written (I mean who wouldn\u2019t\nwant to read \u201cQuantum mechanics without probability amplitudes\u201c) Amusingly\nthese days I think many who claim the mantle of \u201cit from bit\u201d have not\nactually read the paper, which is quite radical, you should definitely stop\nreading this blog and read the paper if you have not.\n\nBecause Wheeler is someone who I\u2019ve always been interested in, I was Googling\n(company plug) around the other day and found out the the American\nPhilosophical Society has a collection with papers, notes, etc from Wheeler.\nAmong these is a typed up note that I don\u2019t think ever made it into a paper,\nbut which I really loved. The title of the note is \u201cTHE UNIVERSE AS A\nCOMPUTER\u201d, and is dated \u201c[1980?]\u201d. In it Wheeler first lists possible meanings\nfor the expression \u201cthe universe as a computer\u201d followed by possible\nimplications for this metaphor. And by list, I don\u2019t mean a small list, he\nputs down 48 possible meanings. I love it.\n\nHere are Wheeler\u2019s possible meanings for the metaphor:\n\n> THE UNIVERSE AS A COMPUTER | [1980?]\n>\n> Possible Meanings of the Metaphor\n>\n> NOTE: Such metaphors tend to be at once useful and misleading. They are\n> understood only intuitively, vaguely, partially, ambiguously, and abstractly\n> by their authors and users. They are apt to be polysemous\u2013possessed of\n> multiple and complex meanings, both relevant and irrelevant. Moreover, in\n> the present instance the utilitarian and natural meaning of the very words\n> universe and computer is unknown to an indefinite degree! Physicists who are\n> trying to conceive a new cosmology based in part on the metaphor of the\n> universe as a computer may find the following list clarifying, heuristic,\n> provocative, useful for self-criticism or discussion, &c. It is a partial\n> list that needs to be extended, systematized, edited, explained, and\n> illuminated by examples and corollaries.\n>\n> 1\\. May be more or less similar or identical to a Turing machine or serial\n> computer, or be wholly or partly I-dimensional.\n>\n> 2\\.

May resemble more nearly a completely parallel computer whose elements\n> are not sub-computers.\n>\n> 4\\. May represent a hybrid serial and parallel computer.\n>\n> 5\\. May represent a hierarchy, network, and/or series of many serial or\n> parallel computers.\n>\n> 6\\. May represent an infinite or finite set of computers.\n>\n> 7\\. May represent a computer of infinite size, complexity, subdivisibilit\n> (componentry), age, lifespan, sophistication, perfection, power,\n> connectivity, programming, knowledge, intelligence, dimensionality,\n> activity, strangeness, and/or the like.\n>\n> 8\\. May (or physics may) reduce to pure mathematics, numbers, or \u2018order\u2019.\n>\n> 9\\. May use or reduce entirely to information, symbols, computer-like rules,\n> states, decisions, operations, markers, pointers, arrays, structures,\n> programs, sets, and/or the like.\n>\n> 10\\. May be like a computer in being instructible and programmable\u2013or re-\n> instructible, re-programmable, controllable, and manipulable. |\n>\n> 11\\.

May represent an analogue computer of finite, infinite, or\n> infinitesimal self-similarity.\n>\n> 16\\. May be mechanical in the sense of being possessed of machinelike\n> entities or phenomena\u2013or of parts, operations, laws, &c that are\n> surprisingly or absolutely simple, regular, interchangeable, interlocking,\n> perfect, universal, reliable, deterministic, knowable, predictable, finite,\n> utilitarian, teleological, rational, constructible, symmetric, efficient,\n> irreducible, repetitive, and/or the like.\n>\n> 17\\. May behave like a computer on occasion or in special situations.\n>\n> 18\\. May use a (central or omnipresent) model of itself.\n>\n> 19\\. May be simulated by a computer with arbitrarily great accuracy.\n>\n> 20\\.

All natural phenomena, entities, and systems (be they trees, rocks, :\n> molecules, bacteria, men, societies, rivers, stars, diseases, clouds, or\n> whatever) may be computers or computer-like (have programs, perform\n> computations, use circuitry, possess memory, use languages, process\n> information, use Boolean logic, or the like).\n>\n> 22\\. May be clock-like or use universally or locally synchronized parts or\n> processes.\n>\n> 23\\. All known laws may be controlled or created by higher laws (possibly\n> arranged in a hierarchy or network). :\n>\n> 24\\. The universe or all physical phenomena may be reducible to computation\n> or a single great calculation.\n>\n> 25\\. May reduce to or be controlled by, or be expressible as, pure (Boolean\n> or non-Boolean) logic.\n>\n> 26\\.

May wholly or in part consist of cellular automata, or be a single\n> great or infinite cellular automaton.\n>\n> 29\\. Physical processes, phenomena, entities, events, quantities, laws,\n> states, and relationships (such as apparent movement, mass, fundamental\n> physical constants, particle populations, 3-space, spacetime, volcanoes, and\n> ocean waves) may be representational, programmatic, or computational\n> illustons~~-or be infinitely ambiguous\u2013rather than truly fundamental or\n> real; and per se, may be alterable or transcendable by gaining knowledge of\n> and control over their \u2018programs\u2019 or an equivalent. Put otherwise, all\n> phenomena, &C may appear or behave as they do because of internal programs,\n> self-models, rules, or computation to which man can gain access.\n>\n> 30\\. May be a lattice\u2013or spacetime may be wholly quantized.\n>\n> 31\\. All quantum numbers may reduce to a single quantum number.\n>\n> 32\\. May essentially represent but a single, individual particle, event, or\n> computer (that somehow generates the illusion of a multifarious world); or a\n> single iterative or recursive operation repeating itself forever or toward a\n> finite future destiny.\n>\n> 33\\. May represent more or less homogeneous or heterogeneous iterative or\n> recursive processes, entities, phenomena, laws, quanta, measurements,\n> disturbances, &c.\n>\n> 34\\. It may be possible to show that information and computation are\n> fundamentally indistinguishable and hence equivalent, or that all of the\n> following must in a similar way be equivalent: information, computation,\n> energy, mass, space, time, and/or the like.\n>\n> 35\\. May be an asynchronous computer (computer with asynchronous parts).\n>\n> 36\\. May be a computer that functions statistically and indeterministically.\n>\n> 37\\.

As science progresses and becomes more complex, difficult,\n> mathematical, and abstract, reliance on the computer may become total; and\n> this may make a purely computational representation of the universe\n> expedient, and justify present-day steps in that direction.\n>\n> 39\\.

All that exists in the universe (including relationships, entities,\n> interactions, laws, &c that are conventionally thought of as being inert,\n> static, or time-invariant) may in fact be time-asymmetric or an\n> uninterrupted process of change or of cosmoplastic or cosmopoietic\n> interadjustments and interchanges; in this \u2018everywhere~ always~novel\n> universe! work and information-processing could be omnipresent and\n> quintessential.\n>\n> \u2013THE UNVIVERSE AS A COMPUTER\n\nThere are a couple of things that struct me in this list. The first is number\n39. \u201c39. No one knows how simple, powerful, universal, natural, and/or complex\ncomputers might ultimately become\u2013and it might be in these ultimate senses\nthat the universe is or resembles a \u2018computer\u2019. (It might even be possible to\ndevise revolutionary types of computers by studying and applying computational\nor computer-like properties of the universe.) \u201d If this is truly 1980, this is\npretty amazing because it is at its heart a statement that the universe\u2019s\ncomputation may be very powerful, and that this might lead us to more powerful\ncomputers. This is right around the time Manin is credited with mentioning the\nidea of quantum computation in his book Computable and Uncomputable and before\nthe 1981 Physics of Computation conference, which I think is rightfully\nconsidered a good point to take as the starting time for quantum computing.\n\nThe second thing that I love is Wheeler. \u201cmay in fact be time-asymmetric or an\nuninterrupted process of change or of cosmoplastic or cosmopoietic\ninteradjustments and interchanges\u201d I mean come on this is awesome who writes\nlike that these days? Wheeler\u2019s writing was so full of this crazy poetry, that\nit famously got parodied in \u201cRasputin, Science, and the Transmogrification of\nDestiny\u201d by \u201cJohn Archibald Wylers\u201d. Excellent stuff.\n\nI was lucky enough to work with a brilliant graduate student, Ben Toner, where\nwe looked at the information cost of simulating entanglement. When we\ncompleted that work, Ben was able to attend a conference in honor of Wheeler,\nand I believe he told him about our work. I\u2019m sad I never got to meet him, but\nI hope he could recognize in Ben talking with him, the long echo of his impact\non those of us who still dream more about computation and the universe.\n\nCategoriesUncategorized\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\n  * RSS feed\n\n##### Cast of Characters\n\n  * Quantum Pontificem\n\n    * Dave Bacon\n  * Quantum Cardinals\n\n    * Charlie Bennett\n    * Steve Flammia\n    * Aram Harrow\n\n##### Quantum Announcements\n\n  * Qspeak\n\n## Recent Posts\n\nProudly powered by WordPress\n\n", "frontpage": true}
