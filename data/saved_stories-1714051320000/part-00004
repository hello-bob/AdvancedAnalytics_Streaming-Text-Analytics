As language learning\nmodels (LLMs) and generative AI apps increase in popularity, copyright issues\nhave continued to pile up without any kind of meaningful resolution.\n\nProblems arise when companies use copyrighted works in training their\ngenerative AI software, and when the outputs of said AI software contain\nsections of works under copyright protection.\n\nCopying copyrighted works in their entirety or using significant sections of\nsuch works for training generative AI software is copyright infringement.\nThere is no \"fair use\" carve-out for AI training, despite what the companies\nthat are training the models say or believe.\n\nWatch the Latest from AppleInsider TV\n\nPowered By\n\n10\n\nNew AirPods LEAK!

In the lawsuit, it was claimed that the two\ncompanies trained their generative AI software using millions of articles\npublished by The New York Times.\n\nThis was not the first time OpenAi faced a lawsuit about model training. In\nSeptember 2023, the company was also sued by several prominent authors, with\nGeorge R. R. Martin, Michael Connelly and Jonathan Franzen being among them.\n\nThe history of generative AI and copyright issues goes back even further, as\nin July of 2023 over 15000 authors signed an open letter addressed to several\nprominent companies, including Alphabet, OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft and more.\n\nThe letter requested that the authors be properly credited and compensated for\ntheir work, which was used in the training of generative AI and language\nlearning models.\n\nAnother, similar class-action lawsuit alleging copyright infringement was\nfiled against OpenAI by non-fiction authors Nicholas Basbanes and Nicholas\nGage. The lawsuit was filed in January of 2024.\n\nIn late April of 2024, another AI-related lawsuit was filed, this time against\nAmazon. The lawsuit alleges that an Amazon employee was instructed to\ndeliberately ignore and violate copyright law so that Amazon could compete\nagainst rival products and services more effectively.\n\nIn the lawsuit, a former Amazon employee claims she was told by a supervisor\nregarding copyright-violating AI training that \"everyone else is doing it\" \u2014\nimplying that people from rival companies were knowingly engaging in copyright\ninfringement.\n\nAnd, it's pretty clear that they are.\n\n## AI and publishers' concerns about reproduction of copyrighted content\n\nAI has been known to reproduce copyrighted content on multiple occasions, and\nthe severity of the problem has inspired companies to analyze the frequency at\nwhich this happens.\n\nTo gain a better understanding of the rate at which AI chatbots generate\ncopyright-protected content, the company PatronusAI decided to look into the\nmatter. The company, which evaluates generative AI models, compared four major\nAI models - OpenAi's ChatGPT-4, Meta's Llama 2, Mistral's Mixtral and\nAnthropic's Claude 2.1.\n\nPatronus AI found the rate at which AI generated copyrighted content\nultimately varied based on the model, but that rates of copyrighted content\ngeneration were high. The company also released its own tool, known as\nCopyrightCatcher, which would detect potential copyright violations in LLMs.\n\nWhile the generation of copyrighted content has serious implications,\npublishers are also concerned over the use of copyrighted material in training\nlanguage learning models.\n\nAn Adobe Firefly-generated image of a wizard mouse. Definitely not Mickey from\nDisney's 'Fantasia'\n\nIn March of 2024, The Wall Street Journal reported that prominent publishers\nwere investigating the use of their copyrighted works in the training of\ngenerative AI models. The publishers wanted to be paid for the use of their\nwork by AI.\n\nGiven the number of lawsuits related to generative AI and copyright and the\nseriousness of the concerns expressed by publishers, it makes sense that a\ncompany like Apple would try its best to avoid any potential legal issues.\n\n## Apple's unique approach to generative AI, language learning models and\ncopyright issues\n\nAs a way of avoiding similar copyright issues during the training of its own\ngenerative AI software, Apple has reportedly been licensing the works of major\nnews publications.\n\nIn December of 2023, it was reported that Apple planned to try and license\nworks from Conde Nast - the publisher of Vogue and The New Yorker. The company\nhad also spoken to IAC and NBC News in an attempt to make a deal worth\napproximately $50 million.\n\nWhile Apple developed its language learning model, known internally as Ajax,\nwith basic on-device functionality, the company took a different approach to\nmore advanced features. Apple considered licensing software such as Google\nGemini for more complex tasks requiring an internet connection.\n\nBy employing this strategy, Apple clearly intended to avoid copyright issues.\nWith the paid licensing, Apple would not be responsible for copyright\ninfringement caused or perpetrated by software such as Google Gemini.\n\nIn a research paper published in March of 2024, Apple revealed that it used a\ncarefully curated mixture of images, image-text and text-based input to train\nits in-house LLM. The method Apple used allowed for better image captioning,\nmulti-step reasoning and preserving privacy, all at the same time.\n\nAn example of an image from an Apple generative AI graphic tool.\n\nWe were told by industry sources that Apple's Ajax LLM preserves privacy\nbecause it does not require an internet connection for basic text analysis.\nThis means that the on-device LLM cannot connect to a database and identify\ncopyrighted content in offline mode, although more advanced features like\ntext-generation would likely feature such checks and connections.\n\nReporting and documented projects aside, guard rails and licensing are only as\nsecure if they are enforced. Sources familiar with Apple's AI test\nenvironments speaking to AppleInsider have revealed that there were seemingly\nlittle to no restrictions to prevent someone from using copyrighted material\nin the input for on-device test environments.\n\nOur source wasn't clear about regulations inside Apple to prevent copyright-\nviolating training. The output, however, is likely more regulated to avoid\nword-for-word reproduction of copyrighted material.\n\nApple should debut its generative AI technology during WWDC which starts on\nJune 10.\n\nFollow AppleInsider on Google News\n\nMarko Zivkovic\n\nAssociate Editor\n\nThrough exclusive articles, Marko has published product designs, detailed\noverviews of new hardware projects, and even information on then-unannounced\noperating systems.\n\n18 Comments\n\n## 18 Comments\n\n## Draco\n\nsaid about 15 hours ago\n\nThis is what I like about Apple: They have a track record of not releasing\nproducts until they are fully baked and actually work the way you expect,\nwhile other companies treat their customers like beta testers.\n\nI'll believe AI is real when Apple releases an AI.\n\n## beautyspin\n\nsaid about 15 hours ago\n\nLooks like excuses have already started.\n\n## Xed\n\nsaid about 15 hours ago\n\n> beautyspin said:\n>\n> Looks like excuses have already started.\n>\n> Ethics are an excuse for what exactly?

It\ncould also include information from other sources to which you have\nsubscribed. It will verbally give you the news summary, naming sources, and\nthen offer to drop links to any items of particular interest that you would\nlike to read in full later.\n\nSuch a summary could be an interactive conversation. You would be able to ask\nSiri what\u2019s the news about a given subject, Siri would search your Apple News+\napp for new information on that subject, summarize it for you, and then offer\nto provide the sources for you to read later.\n\nThis would be yet another example of Apple entering a product category \u201clate,\u201d\nbut only because they have taken the time to create something of quality, that\navoids things like theft of intellectual property, and that is actually\nuseful.\n\nRead More on our Forums\n\n## New iPad Air & iPad Pro models are coming soon - what to expect\n\n## Biden signs TikTok bill into law as Chinese firm threatens legal action\n\n## The best of WWDC \u2014 the developer conference that shapes technology for the\nrest of us\n\n## How to watch Apple's 'Let Loose' iPad Air & iPad Pro event\n\n## Apple's M2 Mac mini is back down to $499.99 at Amazon\n\n## Best Buy kicks off new M3 MacBook Air sale, blowout M2 deals up to $400 off\nstill available\n\n## Latest comparisons\n\n## M3 15-inch MacBook Air vs M3 14-inch MacBook Pro \u2014 Ultimate buyer's guide\n\n## M3 MacBook Air vs M1 MacBook Air \u2014 Compared\n\n## M3 MacBook Air vs M2 MacBook Air \u2014 Compared\n\n## Latest News\n\n## Apple bids farewell to Frank Casanova after pivotal 36-year tenure\n\nAfter nearly four decades at Apple, Frank Casanova, the Senior Director of\nProduct Marketing who recently spearheaded the launch of the Vision Pro\nheadset, has retired.\n\nAndrew Orr | 7 hours ago\n\n6\n\nSponsored Content\n\n## Buckle and Band offers a new take on designer Apple Watch bands for\nsophisticated owners\n\nSilicone straps, plastic leather, and Apple's introduction of FineWoven\naccessories aimed at reducing its carbon footprint have left those looking for\na solid luxury Apple Watch band without many options \u2014 until now.\n\nSponsored Content | 7 hours ago\n\n## Spotify's second iOS app update attempt in EU fails to pass App Store\nreview\n\nA update to Spotify's app in the App Store is on hold, after the streaming\nservice failed to follow rules allowing links to external sites for purchases.\n\nMalcolm Owen | 8 hours ago\n\n0\n\n## Spring iPhone sales slip to lowest activation share in years\n\nThe iPhone's slice of the smartphone activation pie has shrunk to its smallest\nsize in six years, marking a concerning trend for Apple as it grapples with\nthe longest gap yet between its iPhone releases.\n\nAndrew Orr | 10 hours ago\n\n6\n\n## Apple Watch Series X might get new and thinner motherboard material\n\nA new supply chain rumor claims that Apple will switch to thinner resin-coated\ncopper motherboards for a future Apple Watch, echoing previous reports of the\nsame coming to the iPhone 17.\n\nRumor Score\n\n\ud83e\udd14 Possible\n\nWilliam Gallagher | 11 hours ago\n\n0\n\n## Biden signs TikTok bill into law as Chinese firm threatens legal action\n\nPresident Biden has now formally signed the bill that means TikTok owner\nByteDance must sell the platform, or face being banned in the US from 2025.\n\nWilliam Gallagher | 12 hours ago\n\n10\n\n## Competing rumors cast doubt on mini LED iPad Air debut in May\n\nSupply chain sources apparently vary on when Apple may release a 12.9-inch\niPad Air with mini LED, with a new rumor pushing the release much later.\n\nRumor Score\n\n\ud83e\udd14 Possible\n\nMike Wuerthele | 12 hours ago\n\n3\n\n## Apple's M2 Mac mini is back down to $499 at Amazon\n\nThe best M2 Mac mini price we've seen at Amazon has returned, with the\nstandard model dipping to just $499.99.
