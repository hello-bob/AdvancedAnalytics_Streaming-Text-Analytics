You can put spoons and forks all over and they\ncan stick because now we think there is a metal piece to that.\"\n\nHer testimony was in support of a bill that would largely ban vaccine mandates\nin Ohio. The bill never made it out of committee. But the state's medical\nboard opened an investigation the next month. The board intended to ask\nTenpenny a variety of questions, including about her statements \"regarding\nCOVID-19 vaccines causing people to become magnetized or creating an interface\nwith 5G towers... and regarding some major metropolitan areas liquefying dead\nbodies and pouring them into the water supply,\" according to a board report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Further Reading\n\nAnti-magnetizing-vaccine doctor loses medical license\n\nBut the board reported that Tenpenny repeatedly refused to cooperate with the\ninvestigation, though she continued to spread misinformation and conspiracy\ntheories. In August 2023, the board indefinitely suspended her medical license\non procedural grounds for failing to comply with the investigation and issued\na civil fine of $3,000.\n\nSince then, the board said that Tenpenny has begun interfacing with the board.\n\n\"Sherri Tenpenny has met the Medical Board\u2019s conditions for reinstatement\nincluding submission of an application for reinstatement, payment of her fine,\nand certification of cooperation with the board\u2019s investigation to date,\" a\nspokesperson for the State Medical Board of Ohio told The Statehouse News\nBureau. The board voted to reinstate Tenpenny on April 10, and the\nreinstatement is effective upon processing the paperwork, the spokesperson\nsaid.\n\nThe vote was 7\u20132, according to Cleveland.com. Two physicians on the board\nvoted against the reinstatement. The Statehouse New Bureau noted that voting\nmember Betty Montgomery, Republican former attorney general and auditor, voted\nwith the majority but called her vote a \"reluctant yes.\"\n\nIn a social media post last week, Tenpenny wrote, \"Standing strong and\nsteadfast! I'm thrilled to share that my medical license has been reinstated.\"\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### What Happens to the Developers When AI Can Code? | Ars Frontiers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n196\n\nBeth Mole Beth is Ars Technica\u2019s Senior Health Reporter.
