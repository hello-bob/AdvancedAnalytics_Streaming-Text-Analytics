We then convert what we thought we\nheard into features and bug-fixes, prioritized by impact and growth ideally,\nbut more likely by pride and intuition; sometimes we get lucky and those are\nthe same thing.\n\nThis works, after Product/Market Fit. That is, once everything is\nfundamentally working, and the job is \u201cdon\u2019t break what\u2019s working.\u201d Then we\nshould incrementally add utility and delight while not disrupting the money-\nmaking flywheel. Before PMF, it\u2019s not working yet, so the job is to identify\nwhat can work, and for whom, not to make slight adjustments to something\nthat\u2019s not working.\n\nBut then we come to another post-PMF decision: When and how to expand the\nscope of the business.\n\nNot a pivot\u2014that\u2019s for companies that are staring death in the face, that must\nstrike out in a new direction for a chance at survival. Rather, an\nexpansion\u2014to keep what\u2019s working, but sprout new shoots in new directions.\nAdhering to the rules of great strategy by leveraging existing assets to\nattack a valuable new opportunity with asymmetric upside. (Add your favorite\nbuzzwords; those were mine.)\n\nWhen is the right moment to venture into new territory, rather than building\nobvious, incremental things with little risk?\n\nBottlenecked growth\n\n    If existing marketing and sales channels are at their limit, i.e. when spending more time or money doesn\u2019t yield more output, or at least, not cost-efficiently. Then an expansion to a new channel, or new geography, or new market segment, accelerates growth.\nTarget market saturation\n\n    If you\u2019ve already won 5% or more of your perfect market. Some people use acronyms^1 to name this concept; I mean of the total number of people who are your ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)\u2014oh goodie, another acronym\u2014the absolutely-perfect-in-every-way customer whom you are targeting with all your marketing and product features. 5% is not saturation, but if you got to 5%, you can presumably get to 10% with similar methods. Since you\u2019re well on your way to that already, you can afford to turn your attention to segments that are similar enough to be relevant, but different enough that they require effort to serve well.\n\n> ^1 TAM (Total Addressable Market), or SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market);\n> there\u2019s more.\n\nDiversification\n\n    Adding new marketing channels, adding new target markets, adding new geographies, adding new pricing options, should not only add growth, but make the company more robust to market and economic disruptions. At WP Engine we experienced this after expanding upmarket. It wasn\u2019t just \u201cgrowth\u201d\u2014addressing a new segment meant our value proposition became different. Small businesses saw us as \u201cexpensive, but the best,\u201d whereas large companies saw us as \u201clow cost, yet still enterprise-grade.\u201d This diversification of positioning resulted in robust growth during the COVID crisis, where smaller companies were going out of business (i.e. \u201cexpensive\u201d is now bad), but larger companies were looking for ways to save money (i.e. \u201clow-cost\u201d is now good). When one segment has difficulty, the other grows; the net effect is stability. At scale, this is nirvana.\nWhen you can afford to invest\n\n    A company throwing off more than a million dollars a year in profit can afford to try something new; failure in a new investment is not fatal. Expansions are both costly and risky; extra money covers both liabilities. Extra money could come in the form of outside investment or profit draw-downs, but either way it\u2019s a bet, it\u2019s an investment, and the typical investment rules apply.\n\nIf expansion is warranted, we come to the crux of this article: How do you\ndecide in which direction to expand?\n\n## Adjacency\n\nThe key idea is \u201cadjacency,\u201d meaning \u201cclose by.\u201d The difference between\nincremental change and expansion is that expansion is \u201csomewhere else,\u201d but\nthe difference between expansion and something too far afield is \u201cadjacency.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t want to go so far afield that you\u2019re taking on too much risk, you\u2019re\nnot leveraging existing assets, and thus it is too risky, and too costly, such\nthat even if the opportunity is large and tangible, it\u2019s still a bad idea for\nyou. A great strategy, that doesn\u2019t align with your strengths, is a bad\nstrategy for you.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to think of ways to expand the business. You could enter a new\ngeography. You could target a different ICP, different niche, different\nvertical, different use-cases. You could go up- or down-market in the size of\nbusiness you sell to or in the customer\u2019s Needs Stack. You could add a\nfreemium tier, add a higher pricing tier, add a lifetime plan, add a new\nproduct line. You could expand from iOS-only to add Android, from web-only to\nmobile-app, from integrating with one third-party to ten. You could venture\naway from the reputational investment of SEO and social channels into the\nanalytical world of paid-marketing, or venture from the pay-for-today world of\nadvertising to the invest-in-the-future world of SEO and social.\n\nIf you want to be more systematic, you can use something like the Lean Canvas\nto ideate:\n\nsource\n\n(Click to Enlarge)\n\nAsh Maurya\u2019s version of the popular business model \u201ccanvas.\u201d\n\nFill each box according to the existing business, then brainstorm^2 ways that\nyou could expand or improve on each box.\n\n> ^2 Here\u2019s some fresh and fun ways to brainstorm these sorts of ideas. LLMs\n> can be helpful\u2014not to select ideas, but to generate possibilities.\n\nCalculating the potential upside of these ideas will of course be specific to\nthe idea and the company. In this article, I give my general framework for\nevaluating the cost and risks of executing those ideas, answering the\nquestion: How adjacent is this idea to the current business?\n\n\u261e If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! \u261c\n\n## The Adjacency Matrix\n\nStart with a table of the major functional areas of your business. It will be\nsimilar to the following, but tune it for yourself. For example, a company\nleveraging product-led growth may have no Sales department, but might have a\nheavy design culture and thus adds a row for Design.\n\nFunctional area| Types of activities & responsibilities  \n---|---  \nMarketing| getting attention; brand personality & positioning; acquisition\nchannels  \nSales| processing leads; managing the sales process; pitch & compeititve\nmaterials; domain expertise; sales training  \nService| expertise; technical knowledge; domain expertise; product training  \nProduct| understanding the customer; mix of data and intuition; roadmaps;\neverything else  \nEngineering| platforms; architecture; major libraries & frameworks; tech debt;\ninfrastructure; specialized skills and knowledge  \nBusiness Model| Pricing and packaging; unit economics; profitability;\nbudgeting  \n  \nNow evaluate the \u201cadjacency\u201d of your proposal by determining how much each of\nthese activities must change to support the new initiative. Your only choices\nare:\n\n  * Trivial\u2014Almost no changes required. \u201cTraining\u201d is an email or one Zoom session. Adjusting sales and marketing material means adding a few bullets.\n  * Adjustment\u2014Change-management required, but manageable within current processes, norms, and organizational structure, similar to a \u201clarge new feature release.\u201d Requires training. New sales slides. A new web page for the website. A non-trivial change to pricing and packaging. New SMEs in Support.\n  * Overhaul\u2014Major change needed: hiring for new skills or for capacity, significant retraining that might require new specializations, structural process or management changes, especially if the org chart is changing. Often you\u2019re not entirely sure of the full extent of the changes, i.e. it is sufficiently complex that we can\u2019t identify all the challenges and risks that await us.\n\nLongtime readers will recognize this as another instance of my Fermi\nEstimation^3 hobbyhorse, in which we intentionally limit choices to avoid\narguing over details and predictions that we aren\u2019t qualified to make anyway.\nDispositioning into one of these three buckets should be relatively easy,\nwithout extensive analysis.\n\n> ^3 Described completely in how to use Fermi estimation for ROI-type\n> decisions, including both objective dimensions like \u201ctime\u201d and subjective\n> dimensions like \u201cwhat makes for a compelling product,\u201d and echoed in pieces\n> on probabilities, evaluating markets, and making big decisions, among\n> others.\n\nAs an example, I\u2019ll take our company WP Engine in 2013 when our ICP was \u201csmall\nto mid-sized company home pages and small to mid-sized blogs/media, often\nbuilt by freelancers and small agencies.\u201d We\u2019ll evaluate two ideas: (a) expand\nto support marketing campaigns run by Enterprise-sized companies, and (b)\nexpand to host the main websites of Enterprise-sized companies:\n\nFunctional Area| Enterprise Campaigns| Enterprise Full Site  \n---|---|---  \nMarketing| Adjustment (new target audience, and message of \u201ccampaign\u201d instead\nof \u201chome page\u201d)| Overhaul (completely new competitors, new marketing channels,\nestablish brand from scratch)  \nSales| Overhaul (drastically new sales processes and cycle times)| Overhaul  \nService| Trivial| Overhaul (e.g. new people and specializations like account\nmanagement and white-glove on-boarding)  \nProduct| Trivial (campaigns don\u2019t require new features)| Adjustment (new\ncompliance requirements, but few new features)  \nEngineering| Trivial| Trivial (enterprise websites get similar amounts and\ntypes of traffic as popular websites belonging to small companies)  \nBusiness Model| Trivial (existing plans are sufficient)| Adjustment (new\nplans, but same business model)  \n  \nIn this case, the conclusion might seem obvious\u2014of course it\u2019s easier to serve\na small use-case in a new segment (\u201cEnterprise\u201d) than it is to compete in a\nmajor use-case in a new segment.\n\nWhat might not have been obvious is how dramatically different it is to \u201csell\nto the Enterprise.\u201d Often startups claim this as their growth path, even when\nthey\u2019re at only $500k in ARR. This is definitely the wrong strategy at that\nmoment; this exercise makes it clear, yet companies often conclude the\nopposite. They should instead be considering simple use-cases at larger\ncompanies, or they should be ignoring the complexity of large companies so\nthey can continue winning where they are already strong.\n\nFurthermore, it shows how much investment is needed if you insist on investing\nin Enterprise. Sometimes that is the right strategy. After all, calculating\n\u201chow adjacent\u201d is about evaluating the decision, not dictating it. If, for\nexample, a company is at $60M ARR with steady growth in absolute dollars but\nslowing as a percentage of revenue, spending $10M to add an Enterprise-focused\nbusiness model could be a great growth strategy.\n\nIn particular, when more than one area requires a \u201cfull overhaul,\u201d that\u2019s a\ndeal-breaker if this is supposed to be an incremental, sustaining innovation.\nIf multiple areas require a full overhaul, this is only acceptable if (a) you\nare willing to make a huge investment and (b) you\u2019re willing to take a large\nrisk that it will not pay off, and this only makes sense if (c) the potential\nupside is enormous. This reiterates the first rule of investments.\n\nsource\n\nAt some point, the idea is so non-adjacent that it\u2019s definitionally a bad\nstrategy to attempt it, regardless of upside. Strategy is supposed to leverage\nexisting assets; don\u2019t select something that doesn\u2019t do that.\n\n## Selecting the best option\n\nIt is tempting to use a value-divided-by-cost analysis to decide which idea to\nselect, where \u201cvalue\u201d is some estimate of upside, and \u201ccost\u201d is some formulaic\nsummary of the Adjacency Matrix, or possibly an actual dollar or time\nestimate.\n\nIf you are so tempted, I recommend this ROI system, which will force you to be\nrough-shod in both variables, ideally bringing the best ideas to the top of\nthe list with a minimum of debate.\n\nHowever, whenever you are making an investment\u2014doing something with\nsubstantial cost, time, risk, and only hopeful upside\u2014I recommend solving\nfirst for maximal impact, and only secondarily for cost. The reasons are given\nin that article specifically in the context of investments, and also in my\nwork-prioritization system that extends the Rocks, Pebbles, Sand analogy. You\nmight want to use Binstack to identify the items of highest value, only then\nlooking to cost and risk to break ties.\n\nIn this context, the Adjacency Matrix is useful for completely ruling out\nideas that are clearly too far afield, or identifying those which are\nparticularly low-risk.\n\nThe Adjacency Matrix also becomes the outline to your cost and risk analysis,\nidentifying the areas of the business that must be considered. For changes\nthat you already understand, you can describe what needs to be done, what the\nbudget is, and what risks remain. For complex changes, especially the dreaded\n\u201cunknown unknowns\u201d likely to rise from Overhauls, you\u2019ll need to include more:\nthe mitigations will you put in place, objective measures or milestones to\ncatch problems as early as possible, how you will attack the high-risk, high-\nuncertainty areas first, and specialized hires who have seen this movie\nbefore.\n\nFinally, the Adjacency Matrix is useful in communicating the decision to the\nwhole company\u2014something leaders perennially fail to adequately appreciate and\nvalue. It\u2019s vital that the decision is simple to explain and justify, so\neveryone feels that it\u2019s natural, intelligent, and clear. The matrix can help\nform the narrative:\n\n> We\u2019ve all seen the organic pull from larger, enterprise-sized customers.\n> There\u2019s obviously opportunity there, but what is the right way for us to\n> approach it, starting from where we are today?\n>\n> We considered several options, such as ______ and ______. We decided upon\n> ______ because while it will require [department] to [do something complex\n> and risky], we realized it would be really easy for everyone else because\n> [why it\u2019s trivial in other areas]. So, this was the least-risky, highest-\n> chance-for-success way for us to approach this new market, add a new growth\n> area, and learn, and see where it goes from there.\n>\n> Exciting! And let\u2019s remember to give [department] our support and grace as\n> they transform themselves to support this new strategic effort.\n\nCongratulations for hitting Product/Market Fit, starting to scale, and now\nhaving the \u201cgood problem to have\u201d of where to expand next.\n\nHopefully this will help you make the right decision.\n\nPrinted from: A Smart Bear https://longform.asmartbear.com/adjacency/ \u00a9\n2007-2024 Jason Cohen @asmartbear\n\n\u261e If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! \u261c\n\n##### Subscribe for more, and Thank you for sharing!\n\nAdjacency Matrix: How to expand after PMF\n\n1 of 1\n\n### Thank you for sharing this article:\n\n### Inside this article\n\nNo ads.
