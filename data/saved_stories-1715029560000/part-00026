We\u2019re back with a new Sunday issue of the Animation Obsessive\nnewsletter. Our lineup goes like this:\n\n  * 1) When Ghost in the Shell (1995) became a hit.\n\n  * 2) The news in animation.\n\nNow, here we go!\n\n#\n\n1 \u2013 The anime business\n\nAnime is unavoidable today. It\u2019s \u201cbigger than the NFL\u201d for Gen Z, claims\nPolygon. Many of the top animated shows and movies each year are Japanese, and\neven Disney keeps losing at the global box office to films like Suzume, The\nFirst Slam Dunk, Mugen Train and The Boy and the Heron.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t always this way. Once, Japanese animation was counterculture\noutside Japan \u2014 important, but niche.\n\nAmerica and Europe saw their first major \u201canime boom\u201d during the \u201890s. Anime\nspread mainly on videocassette back then, and its fans were rabid. In 1994, a\nWelsh newspaper called anime \u201cthe biggest cult in video for many years.\u201d1\n\nKatsuhiro Otomo\u2019s Akira (1988) was a breakout in this era. It became so\npopular outside Japan in the early \u201890s that the anime industry took notice.\n\u201cAfter Akira, we have been considering the world market during the development\nphase,\u201d Otomo said about his follow-up project Memories (1995).\n\nIt was clear to the Japanese business world that there was money to be made\nhere. Bandai\u2019s Shigeru Watanabe, an Akira producer, watched the film blow up\nstateside and decided to double down on the \u201ctrends\u201d behind Akira\u2019s success\nworldwide. For him, that meant doubling down on realistic animation, which was\nalready rising in anime.2\n\nBut Akira had been an accident, and crafting an overseas hit on purpose wasn\u2019t\neasy. Watanabe was a producer on Memories \u2014 which became a flop. There was a\nknowledge gap when it came to selling anime abroad, he told the Los Angeles\nTimes. Bandai needed the right project, and the right partners. \u201cI don\u2019t think\nit would work if we Japanese try to make a [foreign distribution] system by\nourselves,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Watanabe, his first conscious attempt to capitalize on the\nrealism trend was Ghost in the Shell (1995). And, to make it happen, he worked\nwith producers abroad.\n\nA still from Akira (1988)\n\nEveryone knows Ghost in the Shell now. It was a film that helped to define the\n\u201890s \u2014 endlessly ripped off, referenced and remixed. This project gave anime\nan inroad into markets beyond Japan. As scholar Brian Ruh wrote in the 2000s:\n\n> ... it garnered more attention in the Western media than any previous anime\n> film, save perhaps Akira. ... For better or worse it has become an\n> ambassador abroad for Japanese animated film.3\n\nWhich wasn\u2019t a fluke. It took time and focus to build up to a hit like Ghost\nin the Shell.\n\nThat story started in the early \u201890s, in London. A local businessman saw Akira\nat an art film screening. His name was Laurence Guinness \u2014 and he was hooked.\n\nGuinness\u2019s employer, Island World Communications, released Akira on video in\n1991. It became a UK success that tapped into the growing anime fandom. \u201cWe\nfound a whole underground of interested British kids,\u201d said a higher-up from\nIsland, \u201ca cult thing that none of us really knew much about.\u201d4\n\nA few years later, a subdivision called Manga Entertainment formed in London,\nwith Guinness as a key figure. Its business: finding, translating and selling\nanime with UK appeal. This started to bring in real money, and the company\nopened an American branch in 1994.\n\nFrom the beginning, they had plans to get involved in anime production. That\nwas how Andy Frain (then the head of Manga Entertainment) remembered it. He\u2019d\nbeen part of the push to license and sell Akira in the early \u201890s. As he said:\n\n> ... Akira was just amazing and I wanted to release mostly action-oriented,\n> hi-octane science fiction and fantasy titles. So whilst in Japan I picked up\n> what I thought were the best titles around the time. ... It became clear\n> early on in my trips to Japan that the animation boom was over; nobody was\n> prepared to commit Akira level budgets to productions anymore. I\u2019m not\n> saying that more money makes great anime, but with budget limitations \u2014\n> especially in animation \u2014 there\u2019s no possible way you can ever produce a\n> film that\u2019s technically as competent as Akira, even with great people. So\n> the idea for co-productions was there from the start, provided we were able\n> to achieve a certain level of success to enable us to invest that sort of\n> money overseas.5\n\nThe company was quickly reaching that level. It was one of several in Europe\nand America finding success with anime.\n\nLaurence Guinness in the mid-1990s, as seen on The Anti-Gravity Room\n\nTheir niche was the cool stuff, the flashy, transgressive animation.\nMainstream anime like Sazae-san was largely filtered out in favor of stories\nmore akin to big American comic books. By 1995, Manga Entertainment\u2019s audience\nwas \u201calmost exclusively young men,\u201d reported the Los Angeles Times.\n\nAs the company grew in the UK, its American side rose through guerrilla\ntactics. A former record exec named Marvin Gleicher ran that operation. Most\nAmericans didn\u2019t know what anime was, so he promoted it like music: \u201ccity by\ncity,\u201d with an eye toward local businesses and the newspapers in each place.\n\u201cWe set up 150 university animation society screenings for free or for\ncharity. We licensed stuff to MTV,\u201d he said.\n\nManga Entertainment was doing well in multiple countries \u2014 even releasing\ntranslations across continental Europe. And Shigeru Watanabe was watching all\nof it unfold: he had a highly placed colleague at the company.\n\nWatanabe and Bandai started to plan Ghost in the Shell in 1993, and they soon\nbrought Manga Entertainment in as a co-producer. Foreign money and Japanese\nanimators had mingled before: see Sherlock Hound, or DuckTales. But this was\ndifferent.\n\nGhost in the Shell was meant to be a successor to Akira. It was a Japanese\nfeature billed abroad as \u201canime,\u201d and done in the style that foreigners seemed\nto like. While Akira\u2019s popularity outside Japan had been an accident, Ghost in\nthe Shell was intended to go big in Japan and abroad. It was a film \u201caimed at\nthe worldwide market instead of just Japan.\u201d6\n\nLeft photo (standing, from left): Yoshimasa Mizuo, Laurence Guinness, Marvin\nGleicher, Hiroshi Yamazaki and Tomio Yoshioka circa 1996. Sitting are Shigeru\nWatanabe and Teruo Miyahara. Right photo: Marvin Gleicher circa 1995.\n\nGhost in the Shell looked like a promising vehicle for this plan. As with\nAkira, it was inspired by Blade Runner. Cyberpunk anime was popular abroad,\nand so was anime realism. Its story seemed like a good investment to Manga\nEntertainment, too.\n\n\u201cThe appeal was that the storyline was more universal; it appealed more to a\nWestern culture intellect than most [anime] feature films prior to that,\u201d said\nMarvin Gleicher.\n\nThe film\u2019s director, Mamoru Oshii, was an auteur whose work had already gone\noverseas. He was known for opaque, dialogue-heavy projects. Some in Japan were\nmortified when he was picked to direct Ghost in the Shell, as his style seemed\nto clash with the source material, a poppy manga series. Oshii accepted the\nproject from Bandai in part because he needed the money.7\n\nOshii\u2019s longtime collaborator Kazunori Ito wrote the screenplay. Since Manga\nEntertainment put up part of the budget (the film cost roughly $3 million), it\ngot to review that screenplay. Like Laurence Guinness explained:\n\n> When the script was finally written, I wrote a 25-page script appraisal\n> which contained, as you would expect from twenty-odd pages, a lot of\n> suggestions and comments. This was discussed at length, over many days, with\n> the director. ... Suffice it to say that it changed in small but significant\n> ways so that everybody was happy. We placed a lot of trust and faith in our\n> Japanese partners. Obviously, since we\u2019re based in London, there were\n> physical limitations on how much we could influence the actual production\n> management of the project. We had storyboard approval; we were involved in\n> all the processes up to production, but the actual, physical production was\n> managed by our partners at Production I.G.8\n\nWhatever the edits were, Oshii took them in stride. He treated Ghost in the\nShell like any other film. Asked about the concessions made for overseas\npopularity, he said, \u201cWith the characters and story, we are not doing anything\ndifferent [than usual].\u201d\n\nReally, the biggest concession may have been Ghost in the Shell\u2019s existence in\nthe first place. Investors were interested in a hyperrealistic, Akira-esque\naction film about themes that attracted foreigners. For that reason, this\nproject got the money to be made. The particulars were left mainly to the\nteam, which included top artists like Hiroyuki Okiura (character designer,\nanimator) and Hiromasa Oguro (art director).\n\nIt was a fast production. According to Oshii, it took 10 months \u2014 three of\nthem spent just on the complex layout drawings. He called it an \u201cexhausting\u201d\njob, but he seemed happy enough. Talking after the premiere, Oshii said, \u201cIt\nbecame more of a straightforward movie than I expected it to, so of all my\nfilms, this was surprisingly easier to watch.\u201d9\n\nGhost in the Shell wasn\u2019t a massive hit in Japanese theaters. There were\ndoubts that it could be a hit anywhere. \u201cIt won\u2019t be as big as Akira,\u201d wrote\ncritic Helen McCarthy. She liked the film, but saw it as too alien to \u201cthe\nconsciousness of the Western mass media\u201d to catch on. Roger Ebert felt the\nsame way, praising Ghost but calling it \u201ctoo complex and murky to reach a\nlarge audience.\u201d10\n\nYet it would become a big hit \u2014 the biggest of Oshii\u2019s career \u2014 when Manga\nEntertainment released it on video in 1996.\n\nMamoru Oshii (sitting in the front, to the left) and main members of the Ghost\nin the Shell team. Courtesy of Cinefantastique.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t unusual for anime videos to succeed in the West by this point. The\nfandom had bloomed through local events, clubs, fanzines and the internet\u2019s\n\u201chundreds of colorful fan-made home pages\u201d (to quote the Los Angeles Times).\nThe era of the early anime fansite was well underway. Manga Entertainment made\na good deal of money with Ninja Scroll (1993), and Fox Video\u2019s release of My\nNeighbor Totoro had 450,000 tapes in circulation after just 14 months. The\nsuccesses continued from there.11\n\nEven so, Ghost in the Shell was different.\n\nTo begin, Manga got the film a very limited theatrical run in early 1996.\nPartly thanks to a standout performance in New York, it earned $500,000 ($1\nmillion today). That helped to spread the word and set the video version up\nfor success a few months later.12\n\nYou have to combine that, though, with Manga\u2019s years of legwork to build a\nnetwork of retailers. It sold anime at comic book shops and music outlets,\nrunning tie-ins and promo events along the way. One Manga executive said, \u201cWe\ncome from the record business and are using music tactics to sell video. We\u2019re\npromotion maniacs.\u201d13\n\nSome called it a \u201cgrassroots\u201d approach. Manga didn\u2019t have the supermarkets on\nits side \u2014 it had to get creative. Here\u2019s what Gleicher told AWN in 1996:\n\n> As mass [market] as we get is Musicland and Best Buy. Music stores now get\n> it \u2014 it\u2019s a no-brainer to take a 12-pack of our best rather than pick\n> through 40 or 50 titles puzzling over which to get. Tower has everything.\n> ... Rental stores [like Blockbuster] tend to ignore anything that didn\u2019t\n> take in $100 million at the box office. Offer them a surefire Hollywood hit,\n> each branch wants 20 copies. We can only persuade them to take one copy of\n> Ghost. But that copy is always out! Eventually, we\u2019ll educate them.\n\nIn August 1996, Ghost in the Shell set a record. It hit first place on\nBillboard\u2019s weekly video sales chart, after placing in the top 40 for nearly\ntwo months. No anime film had topped that chart before \u2014 Manga had \u201cstruck\ngold,\u201d according to Billboard. After five months, Ghost had sold 200,000 tapes\njust in America.14\n\nGhost in the Shell at the top of the video sales chart, courtesy of Billboard\n\nCirca 1997: a party to celebrate the success of Ghost, featuring employees\nfrom Manga Entertainment, PolyGram Video, Ingram Entertainment and Right Stuf.\nCourtesy of Billboard.\n\nStores were noticing. \u201cJapanese animation ... is moving from the retail\nperiphery to the main aisles,\u201d reported Billboard that October. Ghost in the\nShell was cited as proof of \u201cthe broadening U.S. market for anime.\u201d It was an\nauteur film respected by the press \u2014 but it was also, crucially, a hit.\n\nManga Entertainment was happy. Shigeru Watanabe was, too. The gamble on\noverseas fans had paid off this time: \u201cjust that we\u2019re getting a profit is a\nbig deal because that\u2019s never happened before,\u201d he said.\n\nGleicher put it this way in late 1996:\n\n> It has been a groundbreaking year for us, but it has been a long, slow\n> process educating the press and convincing retailers that these films\n> deserve space and attention. I wouldn\u2019t say that Japanese animation has gone\n> mainstream, but it is definitely beyond its former cult status.\n\nFrom here, Ghost in the Shell kept selling. One report had it over 500,000\ntapes by 2001, not counting the DVD edition. That was big money. The kind of\nmoney that made the movie business, and the business world in general, pay\nattention.\n\nAt first glance, this is a lot of data and dates \u2014 mostly unrelated to Ghost\nin the Shell\u2019s production. The story of this film is one of artists,\nvisionaries and craftspeople, working hard under a tight deadline. And that\nstory is true.\n\nStill, there\u2019s a second story underneath it. Who paid for Oshii and his crew\nto make a movie, and why?\n\nAnime is an industry, and industries run on money. Ghost in the Shell was an\nauteur action film \u2014 but it was also a bold attempt by Bandai and Manga\nEntertainment to grow the Western anime market. And it succeeded.\n\nAs a result, Ghost had a tremendous influence. It helped to normalize anime\noutside Japan. And, as more retailers opened up to anime, it reached more\nconsumers. Which led to more sales. Which led to more anime.\n\nOshii felt the benefits directly. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier to get money for projects\nnow,\u201d he said in 2002. His films only got more difficult and less commercially\nviable from here, but he got to keep making them. Which hadn\u2019t been guaranteed\nbefore.\n\nIn the \u201890s, when Bandai pitched Ghost to Oshii, he\u2019d come to the meeting with\na pitch of his own. It was a film called Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade. That one\nended up getting made after Ghost, and it wasn\u2019t a hit. But Ghost had already\nsecured Oshii\u2019s career.\n\nHe looked back on that moment in 2016, speaking at a film festival in Toronto.\n\u201cHad I made Jin-Roh back then,\u201d he said, \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t be here today.\u201d\n\n#\n\n2 \u2013 Newsbits\n\n  * The late Cuban animation legend Juan Padr\u00f3n, who passed away in 2020, is having his work archived and digitized for public viewing.

It\u2019s worth mentioning that Japanese\nanimation wasn\u2019t brand new to the outside world in the \u201890s. As an article in\nThe Observer (December 19, 1993) put it, \u201cJapanese anime or animated features\nhave been around for as long as the Hollywood film industry and have been\nperiodically rediscovered by Western audiences every few decades.\u201d\n\n2\n\nSee this archived page.

As much as I knew about the\nanimation of GitS, I had no idea that the Western distributors were so\ninvolved in the production, or that that beloved realist style of Okiura and\nInoue was specifically requested to appeal to foreign tastes. (Well played\nguys, you got this foreigner). Or that Oshii wasn't personally very invested\nin the manga, I figured it was to his taste!
