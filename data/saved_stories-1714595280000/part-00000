The following three concepts are\nclosely related:\n\n  * Given an initial situation, a Pareto improvement is a new situation where some agents will gain, and no agents will lose.\n  * A situation is called Pareto-dominated or Pareto-inefficient if there is some possible Pareto improvement that has not been made.\n  * A situation is called Pareto-optimal or Pareto-efficient if no change could lead to improved satisfaction for some agent without some other agent losing or, equivalently, if there is no scope for further Pareto improvement (in other words, the situation is not Pareto-dominated).\n\nThe Pareto front (also called Pareto frontier or Pareto set) is the set of all\nPareto-efficient situations.^[2]\n\nPareto originally used the word \"optimal\" for the concept, but as it describes\na situation where a limited number of people will be made better off under\nfinite resources, and it does not take equality or social well-being into\naccount, it is in effect a definition of and better captured by\n\"efficiency\".^[3]\n\nIn addition to the context of efficiency in allocation, the concept of Pareto\nefficiency also arises in the context of efficiency in production vs.\nx-inefficiency: a set of outputs of goods is Pareto-efficient if there is no\nfeasible re-allocation of productive inputs such that output of one product\nincreases while the outputs of all other goods either increase or remain the\nsame.^[4]\n\nPareto efficiency is measured along the production possibility frontier (PPF),\nwhich is a graphical representation of all the possible options of output for\ntwo products that can be produced using all factors of production.\n\nBesides economics, the notion of Pareto efficiency has been applied to the\nselection of alternatives in engineering and biology. Each option is first\nassessed, under multiple criteria, and then a subset of options is ostensibly\nidentified with the property that no other option can categorically outperform\nthe specified option. It is a statement of impossibility of improving one\nvariable without harming other variables in the subject of multi-objective\noptimization (also termed Pareto optimization).\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\nFormally, a state is Pareto-optimal if there is no alternative state where\nimprovements can be made to at least one participant's well-being without\nreducing any other participant's well-being. If there is a state change that\nsatisfies this condition, the new state is called a \"Pareto improvement\". When\nno Pareto improvements are possible, the state is a \"Pareto optimum\".\n\nIn other words, Pareto efficiency is when it is impossible to make one party\nbetter off without making another party worse off. ^[5] This state indicates\nthat resources can no longer be allocated in a way that makes one party better\noff without harming other parties. In a state of Pareto Efficiency, resources\nare allocated in the most efficient way possible. ^[5]\n\nPareto efficiency is mathematically represented when there is no other\nstrategy profile s' such that u_i (s') \u2265 u_i (s) for every player i and u_j\n(s') > u_j (s) for some player j. In this equation s represents the strategy\nprofile, u represents the utility or benefit, and j represents the player.^[6]\n\nEfficiency is an important criterion for judging behavior in a game. In a\nnotable and often analyzed game known as Prisoner's Dilemma, depicted below as\na normal-form game, this concept of efficiency can be observed, in that the\nstrategy profile (Cooperate, Cooperate) is more efficient than (Defect,\nDefect).^[6]\n\nPrisoner's Dilemma GameCooperate| Defect  \n---|---  \nCooperate| 2, 2| 0, 3  \nDefect| 3, 0| 1, 1  \n  \nUsing the definition listed above, u(C_i) \u2265 u(D_i) for i \u2208 {1, 2}, thus\nyielding this strategy as a Pareto efficient strategy. In other words, both\nplayers receive an increase in payoff by selecting Cooperate over Defect.\n\nIn zero-sum games, every outcome is Pareto-efficient.\n\nA special case of a state is an allocation of resources. The formal\npresentation of the concept in an economy is the following: Consider an\neconomy with agents and goods. Then an allocation , where for all i, is\nPareto-optimal if there is no other feasible allocation where, for utility\nfunction for each agent , for all with for some .^[7] Here, in this simple\neconomy, \"feasibility\" refers to an allocation where the total amount of each\ngood that is allocated sums to no more than the total amount of the good in\nthe economy. In a more complex economy with production, an allocation would\nconsist both of consumption vectors and production vectors, and feasibility\nwould require that the total amount of each consumed good is no greater than\nthe initial endowment plus the amount produced.\n\nUnder the assumptions of the first welfare theorem, a competitive market leads\nto a Pareto-efficient outcome. This result was first demonstrated\nmathematically by economists Kenneth Arrow and G\u00e9rard Debreu.^[8] However, the\nresult only holds under the assumptions of the theorem: markets exist for all\npossible goods, there are no externalities, markets are perfectly competitive,\nand market participants have perfect information.\n\nIn the absence of perfect information or complete markets, outcomes will\ngenerally be Pareto-inefficient, per the Greenwald\u2013Stiglitz theorem.^[9]\n\nThe second welfare theorem is essentially the reverse of the first welfare\ntheorem. It states that under similar, ideal assumptions, any Pareto optimum\ncan be obtained by some competitive equilibrium, or free market system,\nalthough it may also require a lump-sum transfer of wealth.^[7]\n\n### Pareto efficiency and market failure[edit]\n\nAn ineffective distribution of resources in a free market is known as market\nfailure. Given that there is room for improvement, market failure implies\nPareto inefficiency.\n\nFor instance, excessive use of negative commodities (such as drugs and\ncigarettes) results in expenses to non-smokers as well as early mortality for\nsmokers. Cigarette taxes may help individuals stop smoking while also raising\nmoney to address ailments brought on by smoking.\n\n### Pareto efficiency and equity[edit]\n\nA Pareto improvement may be seen, but this does not always imply that the\nresult is desirable or equitable. After a Pareto improvement, inequality could\nstill exist. However, it does imply that any change will violate the \"do no\nharm\" principle, because at least one person will be worse off.\n\nA society may be Pareto efficient but have significant levels of inequality.\nThe most equitable course of action would be to split the pie into three equal\nportions if there were three persons and a pie. The third person does not lose\nout (even if he does not partake in the pie), hence splitting it in half and\ngiving it to two individuals would be considered Pareto efficient.\n\nOn a frontier of production possibilities, Pareto efficiency will happen. It\nis impossible to raise the output of products without decreasing the output of\nservices when an economy is functioning on a basic production potential\nfrontier, such as at point A, B, or C.\n\n## Pareto order[edit]\n\nIf multiple sub-goals (with ) exist, combined into a vector-valued objective\nfunction , generally, finding a unique optimum becomes challenging. This is\ndue to the absence of a total order relation for . In this case, various\nsolutions can be \"incomparable\"^[10] as there is no total order relation to\nfacilitate the comparison . Only the Pareto order is applicable:\n\nConsider a vector-valued minimization problem: Pareto dominates if and only\nif:^[11] : and We then write , where is the Pareto order. This means that is\nnot worse than in any goal but is better (since smaller) in at least one goal\n. The Pareto order is a strict partial order, though it is not a product order\n(neither non-strict nor strict).\n\nIf^[11] , then this defines a preorder in the search space and we say Pareto\ndominates the alternative and we write .\n\ndominates in the Pareto order (which seeks to minimize the goals and )does not\ndominate in the Pareto order and does not dominate in the Pareto order (which\nseeks to minimize the goals and )\n\n## Variants[edit]\n\n### Weak Pareto efficiency[edit]\n\nWeak Pareto efficiency is a situation that cannot be strictly improved for\nevery individual.^[12]\n\nFormally, a strong Pareto improvement is defined as a situation in which all\nagents are strictly better-off (in contrast to just \"Pareto improvement\",\nwhich requires that one agent is strictly better-off and the other agents are\nat least as good). A situation is weak Pareto-efficient if it has no strong\nPareto improvements.\n\nAny strong Pareto improvement is also a weak Pareto improvement. The opposite\nis not true; for example, consider a resource allocation problem with two\nresources, which Alice values at {10, 0}, and George values at {5, 5}.\nConsider the allocation giving all resources to Alice, where the utility\nprofile is (10, 0):\n\n  * It is a weak PO, since no other allocation is strictly better to both agents (there are no strong Pareto improvements).\n  * But it is not a strong PO, since the allocation in which George gets the second resource is strictly better for George and weakly better for Alice (it is a weak Pareto improvement) \u2013 its utility profile is (10, 5).\n\nA market does not require local nonsatiation to get to a weak Pareto\noptimum.^[13]\n\n### Constrained Pareto efficiency [edit]\n\nConstrained Pareto efficiency is a weakening of Pareto optimality, accounting\nfor the fact that a potential planner (e.g., the government) may not be able\nto improve upon a decentralized market outcome, even if that outcome is\ninefficient. This will occur if it is limited by the same informational or\ninstitutional constraints as are individual agents.^[14]\n\nAn example is of a setting where individuals have private information (for\nexample, a labor market where the worker's own productivity is known to the\nworker but not to a potential employer, or a used-car market where the quality\nof a car is known to the seller but not to the buyer) which results in moral\nhazard or an adverse selection and a sub-optimal outcome. In such a case, a\nplanner who wishes to improve the situation is unlikely to have access to any\ninformation that the participants in the markets do not have. Hence, the\nplanner cannot implement allocation rules which are based on the idiosyncratic\ncharacteristics of individuals; for example, \"if a person is of type A, they\npay price p_1, but if of type B, they pay price p_2\" (see Lindahl prices).\nEssentially, only anonymous rules are allowed (of the sort \"Everyone pays\nprice p\") or rules based on observable behavior; \"if any person chooses x at\nprice p_x, then they get a subsidy of ten dollars, and nothing otherwise\". If\nthere exists no allowed rule that can successfully improve upon the market\noutcome, then that outcome is said to be \"constrained Pareto-optimal\".\n\n### Fractional Pareto efficiency[edit]\n\nMain article: Fractional Pareto efficiency\n\nFractional Pareto efficiency is a strengthening of Pareto efficiency in the\ncontext of fair item allocation. An allocation of indivisible items is\nfractionally Pareto-efficient (fPE or fPO) if it is not Pareto-dominated even\nby an allocation in which some items are split between agents. This is in\ncontrast to standard Pareto efficiency, which only considers domination by\nfeasible (discrete) allocations.^[15]^[16]\n\nAs an example, consider an item allocation problem with two items, which Alice\nvalues at {3, 2} and George values at {4, 1}. Consider the allocation giving\nthe first item to Alice and the second to George, where the utility profile is\n(3, 1):\n\n  * It is Pareto-efficient, since any other discrete allocation (without splitting items) makes someone worse-off.\n  * However, it is not fractionally Pareto-efficient, since it is Pareto-dominated by the allocation giving to Alice 1/2 of the first item and the whole second item, and the other 1/2 of the first item to George \u2013 its utility profile is (3.5, 2).\n\n### Ex-ante Pareto efficiency[edit]\n\nWhen the decision process is random, such as in fair random assignment or\nrandom social choice or fractional approval voting, there is a difference\nbetween ex-post and ex-ante Pareto efficiency:\n\n  * Ex-post Pareto efficiency means that any outcome of the random process is Pareto-efficient.\n  * Ex-ante Pareto efficiency means that the lottery determined by the process is Pareto-efficient with respect to the expected utilities. That is: no other lottery gives a higher expected utility to one agent and at least as high expected utility to all agents.\n\nIf some lottery L is ex-ante PE, then it is also ex-post PE. Proof: suppose\nthat one of the ex-post outcomes x of L is Pareto-dominated by some other\noutcome y. Then, by moving some probability mass from x to y, one attains\nanother lottery L' that ex-ante Pareto-dominates L.\n\nThe opposite is not true: ex-ante PE is stronger that ex-post PE. For example,\nsuppose there are two objects \u2013 a car and a house. Alice values the car at 2\nand the house at 3; George values the car at 2 and the house at 9. Consider\nthe following two lotteries:\n\n  1. With probability 1/2, give car to Alice and house to George; otherwise, give car to George and house to Alice. The expected utility is (2/2 + 3/2) = 2.5 for Alice and (2/2 + 9/2) = 5.5 for George. Both allocations are ex-post PE, since the one who got the car cannot be made better-off without harming the one who got the house.\n  2. With probability 1, give car to Alice, then with probability 1/3 give the house to Alice, otherwise give it to George. The expected utility is (2 + 3/3) = 3 for Alice and (9 \u00d7 2/3) = 6 for George. Again, both allocations are ex-post PE.\n\nWhile both lotteries are ex-post PE, the lottery 1 is not ex-ante PE, since it\nis Pareto-dominated by lottery 2.\n\nAnother example involves dichotomous preferences.^[17] There are 5 possible\noutcomes (a, b, c, d, e) and 6 voters. The voters' approval sets are (ac, ad,\nae, bc, bd, be). All five outcomes are PE, so every lottery is ex-post PE. But\nthe lottery selecting c, d, e with probability 1/3 each is not ex-ante PE,\nsince it gives an expected utility of 1/3 to each voter, while the lottery\nselecting a, b with probability 1/2 each gives an expected utility of 1/2 to\neach voter.\n\n### Bayesian Pareto efficiency[edit]\n\nMain article: Bayesian efficiency\n\nBayesian efficiency is an adaptation of Pareto efficiency to settings in which\nplayers have incomplete information regarding the types of other players.\n\n### Ordinal Pareto efficiency[edit]\n\nMain article: Ordinal Pareto efficiency\n\nOrdinal Pareto efficiency is an adaptation of Pareto efficiency to settings in\nwhich players report only rankings on individual items, and we do not know for\nsure how they rank entire bundles.\n\n## Pareto efficiency and equity[edit]\n\nAlthough an outcome may be a Pareto improvement, this does not imply that the\noutcome is equitable. It is possible that inequality persists even after a\nPareto improvement. Despite the fact that it is frequently used in conjunction\nwith the idea of Pareto optimality, the term \"efficiency\" refers to the\nprocess of increasing societal productivity.^[18] It is possible for a society\nto have Pareto efficiency while also have high levels of inequality. Consider\nthe following scenario: there is a pie and three persons; the most equitable\nway would be to divide the pie into three equal portions. However, if the pie\nis divided in half and shared between two people, it is considered Pareto\nefficient \u2013 meaning that the third person does not lose out (despite the fact\nthat he does not receive a piece of the pie). When making judgments, it is\ncritical to consider a variety of aspects, including social efficiency,\noverall welfare, and issues such as diminishing marginal value.\n\n## Pareto efficiency and market failure[edit]\n\nIn order to fully understand market failure, one must first comprehend market\nsuccess, which is defined as the ability of a set of idealized competitive\nmarkets to achieve an equilibrium allocation of resources that is Pareto-\noptimal in terms of resource allocation. According to the definition of market\nfailure, it is a circumstance in which the conclusion of the first fundamental\ntheorem of welfare is erroneous; that is, when the allocations made through\nmarkets are not efficient.^[19] In a free market, market failure is defined as\nan inefficient allocation of resources. Due to the fact that it is feasible to\nimprove, market failure implies Pareto inefficiency. For example, excessive\nconsumption of depreciating items (drugs/tobacco) results in external costs to\nnon-smokers, as well as premature death for smokers who do not quit. An\nincrease in the price of cigarettes could motivate people to quit smoking\nwhile also raising funds for the treatment of smoking-related ailments.\n\n### Approximate Pareto efficiency[edit]\n\nGiven some \u03b5 > 0, an outcome is called \u03b5-Pareto-efficient if no other outcome\ngives all agents at least the same utility, and one agent a utility at least\n(1 + \u03b5) higher. This captures the notion that improvements smaller than (1 +\n\u03b5) are negligible and should not be considered a breach of efficiency.\n\n## Pareto-efficiency and welfare-maximization[edit]\n\nSee also: Pareto-efficient envy-free division\n\nSuppose each agent i is assigned a positive weight a_i. For every allocation\nx, define the welfare of x as the weighted sum of utilities of all agents in\nx:\n\nLet x_a be an allocation that maximizes the welfare over all allocations:\n\nIt is easy to show that the allocation x_a is Pareto-efficient: since all\nweights are positive, any Pareto improvement would increase the sum,\ncontradicting the definition of x_a.\n\nJapanese neo-Walrasian economist Takashi Negishi proved^[20] that, under\ncertain assumptions, the opposite is also true: for every Pareto-efficient\nallocation x, there exists a positive vector a such that x maximizes W_a. A\nshorter proof is provided by Hal Varian.^[21]\n\n## Use in engineering[edit]\n\nThe notion of Pareto efficiency has been used in engineering.^[22] Given a set\nof choices and a way of valuing them, the Pareto front (or Pareto set or\nPareto frontier) is the set of choices that are Pareto-efficient. By\nrestricting attention to the set of choices that are Pareto-efficient, a\ndesigner can make trade-offs within this set, rather than considering the full\nrange of every parameter.^[23]\n\n## Use in public policy[edit]\n\nModern microeconomic theory has drawn heavily upon the concept of Pareto\nefficiency for inspiration. Pareto and his successors have tended to describe\nthis technical definition of optimal resource allocation in the context of it\nbeing an equilibrium that can theoretically be achieved within an abstract\nmodel of market competition. It has therefore very often been treated as a\ncorroboration of Adam Smith's \"invisible hand\" notion. More specifically, it\nmotivated the debate over \"market socialism\" in the 1930s.^[3]\n\nHowever, because the Pareto-efficient outcome is difficult to assess in the\nreal world when issues including asymmetric information, signalling, adverse\nselection, and moral hazard are introduced, most people do not take the\ntheorems of welfare economics as accurate descriptions of the real world.\nTherefore, the significance of the two welfare theorems of economics is in\ntheir ability to generate a framework that has dominated neoclassical thinking\nabout public policy. That framework is that the welfare economics theorems\nallow the political economy to be studied in the following two situations:\n\"market failure\" and \"the problem of redistribution\".^[24]\n\nAnalysis of \"market failure\" can be understood by the literature surrounding\nexternalities. When comparing the \"real\" economy to the complete contingent\nmarkets economy (which is considered efficient), the inefficiencies become\nclear. These inefficiencies, or externalities, are then able to be addressed\nby mechanisms, including property rights and corrective taxes.^[24]\n\nAnalysis of \"the problem with redistribution\" deals with the observed\npolitical question of how income or commodity taxes should be utilized. The\ntheorem tells us that no taxation is Pareto-efficient and that taxation with\nredistribution is Pareto-inefficient. Because of this, most of the literature\nis focused on finding solutions where given there is a tax structure, how can\nthe tax structure prescribe a situation where no person could be made better\noff by a change in available taxes.^[24]\n\n## Use in biology[edit]\n\nPareto optimisation has also been studied in biological processes.^[25] In\nbacteria, genes were shown to be either inexpensive to make (resource-\nefficient) or easier to read (translation-efficient). Natural selection acts\nto push highly expressed genes towards the Pareto frontier for resource use\nand translational efficiency.^[26] Genes near the Pareto frontier were also\nshown to evolve more slowly (indicating that they are providing a selective\nadvantage).^[27]\n\n## Common misconceptions[edit]\n\nIt would be incorrect to treat Pareto efficiency as equivalent to societal\noptimization,^[28] as the latter is a normative concept, which is a matter of\ninterpretation that typically would account for the consequence of degrees of\ninequality of distribution.^[29] An example would be the interpretation of one\nschool district with low property tax revenue versus another with much higher\nrevenue as a sign that more equal distribution occurs with the help of\ngovernment redistribution.^[30]\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\nSome commentators contest that Pareto efficiency could potentially serve as an\nideological tool. With it implying that capitalism is self-regulated thereof,\nit is likely that the embedded structural problems such as unemployment would\nbe treated as deviating from the equilibrium or norm, and thus neglected or\ndiscounted.^[3]\n\nPareto efficiency does not require a totally equitable distribution of wealth,\nwhich is another aspect that draws in criticism.^[31] An economy in which a\nwealthy few hold the vast majority of resources can be Pareto-efficient. A\nsimple example is the distribution of a pie among three people. The most\nequitable distribution would assign one third to each person. However, the\nassignment of, say, a half section to each of two individuals and none to the\nthird is also Pareto-optimal despite not being equitable, because none of the\nrecipients could be made better off without decreasing someone else's share;\nand there are many other such distribution examples. An example of a Pareto-\ninefficient distribution of the pie would be allocation of a quarter of the\npie to each of the three, with the remainder discarded.^[32]\n\nThe liberal paradox elaborated by Amartya Sen shows that when people have\npreferences about what other people do, the goal of Pareto efficiency can come\ninto conflict with the goal of individual liberty.^[33]\n\nLastly, it is proposed that Pareto efficiency to some extent inhibited\ndiscussion of other possible criteria of efficiency. As Wharton School\nprofessor Ben Lockwood argues, one possible reason is that any other\nefficiency criteria established in the neoclassical domain will reduce to\nPareto efficiency at the end.^[3]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Admissible decision rule, analog in decision theory\n  * Arrow's impossibility theorem\n  * Bayesian efficiency\n  * Fundamental theorems of welfare economics\n  * Deadweight loss\n  * Economic efficiency\n  * Highest and best use\n  * Kaldor\u2013Hicks efficiency\n  * Marginal utility\n  * Market failure, when a market result is not Pareto-optimal\n  * Maximal element, concept in order theory\n  * Maxima of a point set\n  * Multi-objective optimization\n  * Nash equilibrium\n  * Pareto-efficient envy-free division\n  * Social Choice and Individual Values for the \"(weak) Pareto principle\"\n  * TOTREP\n  * Welfare economics\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"Martin J.
