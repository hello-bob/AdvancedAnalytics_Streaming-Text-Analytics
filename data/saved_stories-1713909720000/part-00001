The question is not whether\nyou should implement a GenAI solution in your organization, but how best to\nimplement one, and quickly.\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nNearly every company can gain value from Generative AI solutions. But should\nyou build your own or buy one off the shelf?\n\n  * Enterprises are often impressed by proof-of-concept demonstrations, but drastically misjudge the time and cost to turn these into full enterprise-ready solutions.\n\n  * An enterprise GenAI solution is not just an LLM, but consists of many layers. Each one can bring unexpected challenges.\n\n  * Leveraging the expertise of a GenAI platform can drastically reduce costs and accelerate time-to-market.\n\n  * Buying solutions is often associated with vendor lock-in, but with a field moving as fast as generative AI, buying can actually give you more flexibility than building your own and being stuck with a single LLM.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe time for GenAI is now.\n\nIncorporating GenAI into your business will drive operational excellence, open\nnew avenues for growth and innovation, and enable customized services at\nscale, making GenAI a strategic imperative for forward-thinking organizations\nthat aim to stay competitive in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.\n\nIf you have a strong technical team with a solid track record of building\ndigital solutions for your business, you might be tempted to build your GenAI\nsolution from scratch. But developing GenAI in-house presents many challenges,\nincluding substantial investments in expertise, infrastructure, and ongoing\nmaintenance. The complexities of developing and training generative AI models\ndemand a highly specialized skill set that can be difficult and costly to\nacquire, and staying abreast of rapidly evolving AI technologies and ensuring\nyour solution is being used securely and ethically requires continuous effort\nand resources.\n\nThis is not the first time that enterprises have rushed to build AI solutions\nfor customer support. Around 2015, many enterprises built their own virtual\nassistants in-house, and nearly all of those failed. Even companies like Meta\nand Microsoft faced spectacular failures with M (Facebook's virtual assistant\nstarted in 2015 and discontinued in 2018) and Tay (a chatbot Microsoft\nlaunched and quickly shut down in 2016 after multiple problems).\n\nMany banks and other companies also attempted to quickly build their own AI\nsolutions in-house and spent millions of dollars and many years of ultimately\nwasted development effort. While companies do not like publicly discussing\ntheir failed projects, it\u2019s likely that of every 100 attempted AI solutions,\nonly three or four ended up in production, and a majority of these were later\ndiscontinued.\n\nIn the end, it\u2019s common for a company to spend $2-3 million dollars and two or\nmore years to try and fail to develop a solution in-house that could have been\ndone by a vendor at a 10x lower cost and a time frame measured in months.\n\nFortunately, the current surge in GenAI means you have unprecedented access to\nscalable, customizable, and efficient solutions to integrate into your\noperations, whether you choose to buy an off-the-shelf solution or design a\nhybrid approach that combines externally sourced tools and platforms with\ncustom-developed in-house solutions\n\nLet's break down the different layers that make up enterprise GenAI solutions\nto help you decide whether you want to build or buy your GenAI solution, or\nsomething in between.\n\n## The often underestimated gap between a proof-of-concept and an enterprise-\ngrade solution\n\nWith the explosion in AI tools, it's very easy to build a quick demonstration\nof a generative AI solution. Because you can take some PDFs and 'chat' with\nthem using LangChain or any of a plethora of other tools, it's common for\nteams to get an initial 'wow' factor and then completely misjudge the gap\nbetween that demo and a production solution.\n\nThis leads to internal teams committing to building a solution in unrealistic\ntime frames, and companies releasing solutions that are completely unfit for\npurpose, resulting in many embarrassing and costly mistakes, such as the now\ninfamous case of DPD releasing an AI agent that would happily disparage its\nowner if asked.\n\nEnterprise features such as an input guard (filtering the user's messages) and\nan output guard (filtering the AI's messages) would have prevented this.\n\nIn another example, a GM dealer was forced to deactivate their chatbot after\nit offered to sell a car for $1 in what the bot claimed to be a legally\nbinding offer.\n\nThe fact is, there is a mountain of complexity between the simplest\ndemonstration of a cute AI bot, and an enterprise solution. This is seen in\nthe explosion of AI startups that have raised millions of dollars to try to\nsolve very specific parts of the challenge of building your own GenAI solution\nin-house.\n\nThe LLM has the 'wow' factor for GenAI solutions, but it's only a small piece\nof the overall complexity\n\n## Why building AI is different from building software\n\nAlthough you'll need a strong software competency in-house to even consider\nbuilding your own GenAI solution, many companies find out the hard way that\nbeing good at building in-house AI solutions is not the same as traditional\nsoftware engineering.\n\nWith software, the focus is on code. It's easy and cheap for developers to\ntest code and integrate it into a complete solution. It's also fairly\nstraightforward to host and run that code.\n\nAI solutions have a large software component, but they also require the\nmanaging of models and datasets at a scale that most software engineering\nteams have not experienced. Developing and testing features is a lot harder,\nas experiments might need to run for weeks on expensive servers before results\ncan be seen.\n\nEven engineers who have experience with machine learning are often unequipped\nwith the skills to build and evaluate AI models. In machine learning, you can\ntest your solution by having a predicted result and a gold-standard answer. To\ntest how good your solution is, you verify that x = X\u2014that what you generated\nis the same as what you expected, or at least very close\n\nGenAI testing demands a more sophisticated framework. Your AI agent might\ngenerate a correct answer that means exactly the same thing as your example\ngold-standard answer but looks very different, as the agent could have used\ndifferent words and a different sentence structure than the example answer\nwhile conveying the correct meaning.\n\nDatasets are usually much bigger: Engineers have to handle petabytes of data,\nand many of their usual tools cannot easily view or manipulate the underlying\nfiles.\n\nEven once a model is trained, developers need to work out how to do inference\nefficiently, otherwise, it can take minutes for the AI solution to process\neach interaction.\n\nBeyond initial development, continuously ensuring that AI models improve over\ntime requires a robust framework for monitoring accuracy metrics. This\ninvolves rigorously testing models across different conditions to\nstatistically verify improvements, eliminating reliance on guesswork. It's\nabout using data-driven insights to continually improve models, ensuring that\nthe software not only maintains but also enhances its performance based on\nreal-world feedback and evolving data.\n\nThe AI development process needs a deeper statistical understanding and\napplication\u2014a distinct shift from conventional software engineering practices\nwhere outcomes are more predictable. Developers who are primarily used to\nmanaging and developing code might not have the experience required to also\nmanage data, models, hardware, and inference.\n\n## Beyond deployment: Maintenance and evolution\n\nWhen it comes to weighing up build versus buy options for Generative AI\nsolutions, many of the same tradeoffs that apply to buying or building any\nsystem come into play, though they are often subtly different when it comes to\nGenAI.\n\nFor example, you need to decide whether you want to be responsible for\nmaintenance on your solution, or to have that handled by someone else. While\nin many cases, enterprises choose to take on a maintenance burden to keep\ndevelopment in-house, with GenAI solutions, they need to take into account\nadditional considerations. For example\n\n  * Talent scarcity: maintenance often needs to be done by highly experienced AI engineers. There\u2019s a skills shortage for people who can do this, so it\u2019s not always just about maintaining the extra headcount, but about finding experts who can solve your problems.\n\n  * Speed of evolution: with other solutions, you may be able to do maintenance every year, or even every few years. The GenAI market is moving so fast that you need to keep up with integrating new models, and other technology that might have a lifecycle measured in weeks.\n\nBy buying into a mature platform, you gain not only the benefits of this\nmaintenance being done for you, but also benefit from fixes done for other\ncustomers of that platform. If a specific customer has problems with\nhallucinated responses, the platform can roll out a fix for that to all\ncustomers, even the ones that have not yet experienced the problem.\n\n## Understanding the layers of a GenAI solution\n\nYou might think of a GenAI solution as a cohesive whole, but in reality, these\nsystems are built from distinct layers, starting with the large language model\n(LLM) at the base.\n\nLayer 1: Foundational LLM model: The LLM at the core of your GenAI solution,\nfor example, GPT, Gemini, Mistral, Llama 3, or Claude.\n\nLayer 2: RAG platform and conversational flows: A retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) platform that augments the base model with your enterprise\nknowledge base and company data, for example, Azure RAG or Doc Brain.\n\nLayer 3: Frontend: The interface your users will use to interact with the\nGenAI system, for example, Intercom, email, WhatsApp, a custom web widget, or\nan omnichannel solution that lets users choose how to interact with the AI.\n\nLayer 4: Enterprise features: The advanced functionalities, capabilities, and\nsupport mechanisms that cater to your specific needs and address your\nbusiness's scale, complexity, security, compliance, integration, and\noperational requirements, for example, user management, regulatory and\ngovernance compliance, access governance, PPI anonymization, content\nfiltering, and SLAs.\n\nLayer 5: Integrations: At the pinnacle of the enterprise GenAI structure,\nintegrations are the connections between the GenAI system and other business\nsystems and applications that allow for automated workflows, enhanced data\nflow, and seamless communication with existing technologies and processes, for\nexample, Genesys, Sharepoint, Confluence, and Teams.\n\nEach of these layers can be built internally or bought off the shelf. If you\nwant to mix and match by buying each layer separately or building certain\nelements in-house, you'll still need to put in significant effort to combine\nthe parts into a cohesive whole.\n\n## Layer 1: Foundational LLM model for enterprise GenAI\n\nWhile building your own LLM from scratch is technically possible, it's not\nfeasible to compete with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and a handful of other\nwell-resourced players in this space. Developing a model takes years of\nresearch and development, and millions of dollars.\n\nFor this layer of your GenAI solution, you have a few options.\n\nBuy a higher-level solution that includes LLM access. If you buy a complete\nsolution off the shelf, it will likely come with a foundational model or an\noption for you to pick between several.\n\nContract with an LLM provider directly. You can purchase credits or\nenterprise-level agreements with providers such as OpenAI, Microsoft, or\nGoogle directly. You will then get access to an API where you can send\nmessages and receive completions from the LLM.\n\nBuild on top of an open-source model. While it is possible to build on open-\nsource models like Llama 3, these LLMs are a lot harder to use than people\nexpect. Even after correctly deploying and fine-tuning open-source models and\nbuilding the supporting infrastructure, the quality of open-source LLM\ngeneration does not come close to that of proprietary models. For example,\nGPT-4 scores 67% on the popular HumanEval benchmark, compared to the Llama 2\nscore of 29.9%.\n\nBuild your own model from scratch. Building your own model from scratch is\nseldom the best option but if you were to choose this route, you would need:\n\n  * Software: A programming language like Python, a deep learning framework like Pytorch or Tensorflow.\n\n  * Hardware: Primarily GPUs for training and inference, purchased from NVIDIA or rented from a cloud provider like AWS.\n\n  * Data: The Pile is an 800 GB text dataset that is a popular starting point for training LLMs.\n\n  * Algorithms: The exact training methods of the best LLMs remain a secret, but depend on algorithms such as the transformer deep-learning architecture.\n\nUnexpected challenges you might experience while building your own layer\ninclude long training times (sometimes weeks or months), expensive hardware\nthat is in short supply, and a talent shortage of engineers who know how to\ntrain or fine-tune LLMs.\n\n## Layer 2: RAG, intent building, and conversational flow platforms for\nenterprise GenAI\n\nFoundational LLM models have access to a vast array of information, but it's\nnot complete. GPT-4 doesn't know anything that happened in the world after\nApril 2023, and doesn't have access to your company-specific data and\nknowledge base unless this was available publicly on the internet when GPT was\ntrained.\n\nTo add up-to-date or proprietary information to your GenAI solution, you'll\nneed a Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) platform.\n\nOnce your AI is augmented with up-to-date or company-specific information,\nyou'll also need to design specific conversational flows using intents and\nother conversational actions.\n\nYour options for the RAG layer of your enterprise GenAI platform are to build\nyour own, buy a RAG-specific solution, or integrate a higher-level solution\nthat includes RAG functionality.\n\nRegardless of the route you choose to follow for the RAG layer of your\nenterprise GenAI system, one of the challenges you'll face will be automating\nupdates to the model's knowledge base. When information in your enterprise\nrepositories changes\u2014on your website, or in SharePoint or Confluence\u2014these\nupdates must automatically reflect in your RAG solution to maintain accuracy.\nOff-the-shelf RAG platforms don't typically provide this automation, and\ncreating a system that seamlessly updates to capture new content without\nmanual intervention adds complexity to development.\n\nResources for building your own RAG platform.\n\nTo build a RAG platform, you'll need:\n\n  * A vector database such as Qdrant, PineCone, or PGVector. There are dozens of proprietary, open-source, and open-core solutions available, so you'll need to carefully assess which one best fits your needs.\n\n  * A framework like LangChain to load and parse your data, chunk it appropriately, and turn it into vectors.\n\n  * A data warehouse like Amazon Redshift, Snowflake, or Apache Doris. Again, there are many proprietary and open-source solutions.\n\n  * A workflow management solution like Apache Airflow to manage your data pipelines and keep your vector database updated.\n\nTo add intents, you'll need to use a conversational platform like Rasa or\nMicrosoft Bot Framework. This will let you architect conversational patterns,\nto help structure the dialog of your AI solution and keep it focused on\nsolving customer problems.\n\n### Off-the-shelf RAG solutions\n\nMicrosoft and Amazon offer Azure AI Search and AWS Kendra respectively, but in\nreality, these are much lower-level building blocks than they appear, and\nwon't save you much time compared to building your own from scratch, as you'll\nstill need to do the heavy-lifting when it comes to ingesting your data,\nsetting up connectors, and dealing with edge cases, such as correctly parsing\ntables in PDF files.\n\nBasic RAG platforms like Azure AI Search offer a straightforward approach to\ndata ingestion, but they fall short when it comes to leveraging metadata to\nenrich RAG results. If your bot has ingested some information from a large\nknowledge base, it still needs access to detailed metadata so that it can also\nprovide extra context to the user about where that information originated.\n\nCritical elements such as titles, product information, or other contextual\nfactors play a significant role in refining RAG outputs, and incorporating\nthese elements into a simple RAG system requires bespoke coding solutions and\nongoing maintenance responsibilities.\n\nOn top of that, you'll likely run into complications when it comes to\ncorrectly chunking your data, dealing with different file formats and\nencodings, and deduplication.\n\n### Startups in the RAG space\n\nThere are startups like Arcee and Deepset that have raised millions of\ndollars, showing how complicated just this component can get. They provide\ndedicated solutions in the RAG space, letting you build and customize your own\nRAG platform with your own custom data.\n\nOnce again, it's easy to be fooled by the 'getting started' demos. When it\ncomes to actually using a RAG platform, you'll need to spend thousands of\nengineering hours in cleaning your data, tweaking configuration, and\nexperimenting with different options like using vector databases, full-text\nsearch, or a hybrid approach.\n\nGalileo, a startup that focuses on observability, has a detailed post\noutlining how complicated a RAG system can get with components such as query\nrewriting, ranking, caching, guardrails, and many others, each of which can be\nindividually optimized.\n\n## Layer 3: Frontend for enterprise GenAI\n\nIf your GenAI solution is customer-facing, you'll need to put some thought\ninto how it looks. In many cases, your solution will have several faces\ndepending on your use case. Maybe your customers can interact with a chatbot\non your website and receive AI-generated messages on support platforms like\nZendesk. Your employees might also have integrations built into back-office\nsystems to make it easy for them to tag-team with the AI to provide hybrid\nresponses.\n\nBuilding your own frontend or interface for your GenAI solution depends\nheavily on your existing software stack, and once again, you have the choice\nof building from scratch, buying a component, or buying a complete solution.\n\nBuilding from scratch. You'll need a frontend framework like React or Next.js\nor the capability to use components and libraries such as FastChat. You'll\nalso need to build a fast backend using tools like Redis and store the chat\ndata in a database such as Postgres.\n\nTo optimize GenAI for interactions, it's critical to customize interfaces both\nfor end users and enterprise agents. For end users, the UI should indicate\nwhether they are interacting with an AI or a human, adapting to specific\nscenarios to improve understanding and trust. For instance, in customer\nsupport settings, such as banking, the UI could offer visual cues on messages\nto clarify the nature of the interaction. Should a human be required to step\nin, the UI should inform the end user that they are interacting with an agent.\n\nOn the enterprise side, agents should receive customized UI alerts based on\nthe context of the user they are assisting. For example, if a customer\nrequests a significant transaction, the system could automatically flag any\nsuspicious activity and notify an agent to intervene.\n\nBuying a chatbot component. Proprietary components like Intercom or open-\nsource alternatives like Papercups offer chatbot widgets. If you already use a\nCRM like Salesforce, it may come with a chatbot widget that you could\nintegrate with.\n\n## Layer 4: Enterprise features for GenAI\n\nMany of the open-source or self-hosted building blocks for getting started\nwith building your own GenAI solution do not take into account enterprise-\nspecific needs like privacy, security, data governance, and certifications.\n\nEnterprises need to protect themselves from practical concerns and legal risks\nwhen it comes to building GenAI solutions. This applies to:\n\n  * Data privacy: The data fed into the GenAI solution. Normally you'll need to run a PII (personal identifiable information) anonymization pipeline on any data before it gets ingested.\n\n  * Guardrails: You'll need to carefully think about what you let users say to your AI, and what you let your AI say to your users. Guardrails, Laerka, Aim, and Prompt have raised millions of dollars to help companies secure their AI solutions, showing just how challenging this seemingly simple problem can be.\n\n  * AI-generated data: The data generated by the GenAI solution. A small claims court recently forced Air Canada to abide by a promise its chatbot made to a customer, underscoring the importance of grounding in AI, the process of aligning the system's outputs with verifiable facts and the organization's capabilities to minimize the risk of misleading or inaccurate information.\n\n  * Compliance: Various AI-specific and AI-adjacent policies and frameworks, such as SOC 2 certification, GDPR compliance, the EU AI Act, the upcoming US AI Bill of Rights, and a plethora of others.\n\nSimilarly to the previous layers, you have a few options when it comes to\nenterprise features for your GenAI solution. You can:\n\nBuild the required safeguards and get your own certifications. This can take\nmonths or years to prepare for, and often involves lengthy feedback cycles\nwhile auditors find gaps in your processes that need to be addressed. In\naddition, your team will need to research and stay up-to-date with the\nevolving legal requirements specific to AI development, a critical step that\nintertwines with compliance efforts. You'll also need your team to work cross-\nfunctionally across product, engineering, and legal to check every compliance\nbox.\n\nGet security and compliance help from a partner. Many agencies can help you\nget SOC 2 or ISO 27001:2022 compliance, perform penetration testing on your\nin-house solution, and consult about privacy and compliance, but none provides\na panacea. In the end, you will still need to do the legwork to ensure that\nyou understand the risks associated with GenAI and can guard against them, and\nconvince regulatory authorities that you have done so.\n\nBesides compliance, the enterprise features of your GenAI solution are\ncritical mechanisms that ensure the system not only functions effectively\nwithin its technical and legal boundaries, but also remains adaptable, user-\nfriendly, and transparent.\n\nAmong enterprise feature considerations like scalability, flexibility,\nperformance, reliability, and monitoring and analytics, you'll want to pay\nparticular attention to:\n\n  * Prompting and LLM Validation: Devising precise prompts and validating LLM outputs are crucial for tailoring responses and ensuring the relevance and accuracy of the information provided.\n\n  * Audit Trails: Essential for tracking changes, usage, and interactions with the GenAI system, providing transparency and accountability.\n\n  * Retraining workflows: Beyond static LLM applications, integrating retraining processes and workflows ensures that the GenAI solution evolves and adapts over time, staying relevant and efficient.\n\n  * Non-technical friendly UI: A crucial layer that allows business users to control, train, and improve system performance without deep technical expertise. An emphasis on the No-code development philosophy is essential.\n\n## Layer 5: Integrations for enterprise GenAI\n\nAs your solution scales, you're going to find more and more use cases for it,\nand this means you should consider from the start whether your solution will\nreadily integrate with different systems.\n\nIt's crucial to consider the embedded AI approach, where solutions not only\nintegrate but also offer intelligent assistant capabilities within leading\nenterprise platforms such as Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics, Confluence, or\nGenesys. This transformative feature significantly enhances adoption and\nstreamlines processes.\n\nYou can build your own integrations from scratch, use third-party tools like\nUiPath or Blue Prism, or rely on the integrations already built into a\ncomplete solution.\n\nBuilding your own integrations. You can use data connector tools like Airbyte\nor lower-level event streaming tools like Apache Kafka to move data between\ndifferent systems and make it available to your GenAI solution.\n\nBuying an off-the-shelf data automation tool. Platforms like Zapier have\nmature connections to nearly every platform imaginable, but they are primarily\ndesigned for consumer use, not enterprise, and their pay-per-use pricing can\nlead to budget shocks as you scale. Other options like Workato are more\nenterprise-ready, but will require time for your team to onboard and learn.\n\n## Bonus Layer 6: Deployment, monitoring, and observability\n\nWe mentioned five layers, but once you've built your complete solution, you're\nstill not done. You'll need to deploy and monitor your solution.\n\nThe world changes and how people interact with your system changes too, so\njust because it works well in a specific week does not mean that it will\ncontinue to work well in the future.\n\nYou'll need to constantly measure how your system performs on different\nmetrics, including accuracy and performance. This includes monitoring each\ncomponent of the system individually, as well as the platform as a whole.\n\nUnlike monitoring traditional solutions, GenAI solutions are harder as they\nproduce non-deterministic outputs, so you can't easily match what it's\nproducing against what you expect.\n\nSolutions like LangSmith will help you monitor quality over large test suites.\nArize and friends will let you monitor your models directly, and Galileo will\nhelp you scale the creation and evaluation of experiments to help you improve\nand maintain your platform.\n\n## The bottom line on build vs. buy enterprise GenAI\n\nIn the fast-moving and high-stakes race that is GenAI, it's hard to predict\nwhich LLM will come out on top, which AI service providers will be responsive\nto the demands of an evolving market, or how regulatory changes and developing\nindustry standards will impact the AI landscape in the short and long term.\n\nBuilding a GenAI solution for your business from scratch is only realistic if\nyour business is AI.\n\n### The hybrid approach\n\nIf you're considering a hybrid strategy for deploying enterprise GenAI\nsolutions, analyze the strengths of both the off-the-shelf and custom\ncomponents so that your business benefits from the best of both worlds while\nmitigating potential risks.\n\n  * Identify the specific goals and requirements of your GenAI initiative. Understand where off-the-shelf solutions can meet your needs and where custom development is necessary.\n\n  * Assess the ease of integration between external GenAI services and your existing systems. Seamless integration is crucial for a hybrid strategy to work effectively.\n\n  * Ensure that any external GenAI service complies with your data privacy and security requirements. Understand how data will be handled, stored, and processed by third-party services.\n\n  * Evaluate whether the solutions (both off-the-shelf and custom) can scale according to your business growth and meet your performance benchmarks.\n\n  * Consider the total cost of ownership, including development, maintenance, and subscription fees for off-the-shelf products. A hybrid approach may not be cost-effective in the long run if you fail to factor in unexpected challenges or changes.\n\n  * Ensure you have access to the necessary technical expertise, both for integrating external services and for developing and maintaining custom solutions.\n\n  * Choose reputable service providers with a track record of reliability and robust support. Their ability to support your business needs over time is crucial.\n\n  * Verify that the GenAI solutions, both purchased and developed, comply with relevant regulations and laws, such as GDPR or CCPA, especially when handling sensitive data.\n\n  * Consider how easy it will be to update or replace components of your GenAI solution as new technologies emerge. A flexible architecture can help accommodate future changes without significant overhauls.\n\n  * Reflect on the ethical implications of your GenAI applications, including bias, fairness, and transparency. Ensure your approach aligns with ethical guidelines and societal expectations.\n\n  * Define clear metrics for evaluating the success of your hybrid GenAI strategy. Continuous monitoring and evaluation will help you adjust your approach as needed.\n\n## Buying an enterprise GenAI solution\n\nThe best choice for most enterprises is to buy an off-the-shelf solution or\npartner with an enterprise GenAI service provider so that you can avoid the\nhigh upfront costs and operational distractions of building your GenAI\nsolution and remain focussed on your business's core competencies and\nstrategic goals.\n\nSome things to consider as you weigh up your options:\n\n  * While it's not feasible to build your own foundational LLM, you don't want to find yourself locked into an inferior model either. Your GenAI partner should offer the flexibility to choose the LLM that best suits your needs and switch models when necessary to maintain a competitive edge.\n\n  * Although it seems like you're spoilt for choice when it comes to buying a RAG platform to integrate into your in-house GenAI solution, the reality is fraught with pitfalls. To fully leverage RAG technology, consider purchasing an integrated GenAI solution with advanced RAG features designed to handle complex data contexts and provide superior RAG outcomes without the need for custom development and maintenance.\n\n  * You might already be using several tools that all offer their own frontend for an AI chat-powered interface. Make sure you understand exactly what each tool can do before settling on one as it's very easy to get locked into your first option, only to discover its limitations down the road.\n\n  * Compliance and security are often afterthoughts, but you must understand the risks and requirements upfront if you don't want to get burned or face long delays in releasing your own solution. If you are working with a GenAI partner, make sure you understand what certifications they have, and whether or not these can be carried over to your firm as part of the partnership.\n\n  * There's no shortage of integration options available, but connecting disparate platforms is always going to be one of the main causes of headaches for your team. APIs change and data connectors are brittle, so companies often underestimate the maintenance costs of building their own integrations. Before closing the deal with a GenAI partner, make sure that you understand upfront exactly what integrations they offer, and any limitations that might apply to these integrations.\n\n## Key advantages of buying an enterprise GenAI solution\n\nWhile it may seem that building a GenAI solution in-house is ideal\u2014ensuring a\nperfect fit with existing processes and addressing your specific needs and\nopportunities in a way that off-the-shelf solutions might not\u2014it's easy to\nunderestimate the timelines and costs involved in developing this kind of\nniche technology.\n\nSome compelling arguments for buying an enterprise GenAI solution include:\n\n  * Time to market: Building your own GenAI solution may bring you the flexibility and customization you need, but it can take years to develop a comprehensive platform. Consider that some of the time-consuming aspects of building a GenAI solution include:\n\n    * Research and planning in terms of what type of AI model will best suit your business needs, data requirements, and potential technical and regulatory requirements.\n\n    * Data collection and preparation in high volumes to train the model on\u2014collecting, cleaning, and labeling sufficient data is critical for the quality and relevance of the model's performance and accuracy but is one of the most time-consuming stages of developing GenAI.\n\n    * Testing and validation against unseen datasets to assess a model's performance, accuracy, and bias\u2014an iterative process that requires many rounds of adjustments and retraining.\n\n    * Integration and deployment of a GenAI solution into existing systems and workflows that may not be designed to accommodate AI-driven processes, and setting up the necessary infrastructure like cloud-based services, on-premises servers, and privacy and security measures to protect the data.\n\n    * Compliance and ethical considerations.\n\nPartnering with a GenAI platform will have you reaping the benefits of a GenAI\nsolution in a matter of weeks rather than years.\n\n  * Competency: Finding AI engineers is difficult. Even companies that have well-developed in-house software competency are surprised to find that GenAI development has other challenges like big data management, specialized hardware, and challenging latency requirements for inference.\n\n  * Cost: The cost of GenAI extends beyond initial set-up costs to include ongoing expenses such as data pipeline development, process optimization, and technology to keep up with the latest industry developments. External GenAI partners have already made these investments and developed sophisticated pipelines and processes that you can leverage cost-effectively.\n\n  * Risk: It's challenging to fully control and set boundaries for GenAI solutions, and policies around these emerging technologies are constantly changing and vary considerably between regions. It might be tempting to shortcut innovation by opting for \"quick-and-dirty\" methodologies to implement GenAI in your business, but this often proves to be problematic\u2014more dirty than quick\u2014in the long run, especially as regulatory frameworks and data protection laws like GDPR introduce complex compliance challenges. A GenAI partner will have safeguards in place to protect you from risks you might not have even considered.\n\n  * Flexibility: In-house software solutions often have a lower risk of vendor lock-in than purchased solutions, but this is not the case for GenAI.
