The paid accounts\nposting the content all consistently posted antisemitic or pro-Nazi material.\nExamples included praise of Nazi soldiers, sharing of Nazi symbols and denials\nof the Holocaust.\n\nThe pro-Nazi content is not confined to the fringes of the platform. During\none seven-day period in March, seven of the most widely shared pro-Nazi posts\non X accrued 4.5 million views in total. One post with 1.9 million views\npromoted a false and long-debunked conspiracy theory that 6 million Jews did\nnot die in the Holocaust. More than 5,300 verified and unverified accounts\nreshared that post, and other popular posts were reshared hundreds of times\napiece.\n\nX\u2019s policies ban glorifying violence \u2014 a broad prohibition that X has\nsometimes used to take down pro-Nazi content and accounts. The rules also ban\n\u201cpraising violent entities\u201d and say the platform will apply labels to hate\nimagery like swastikas. But NBC News found that X does not appear to be\nenforcing those policies consistently.\n\nThe findings are the latest evidence of a flourishing Nazi network on X under\nMusk\u2019s ownership. Previous investigations by news organizations and anti-hate\nwatchdogs have documented many examples of antisemitism, white supremacy and\nsupport for Nazism on X.\n\nNBC News found the Nazi propaganda posts by browsing the platform: scrolling\nthrough replies, clicking on user profiles and looking through the engagements\non viral posts. NBC News conducted its review during one week in late March.\nThe number of verified subscribers posting pro-Nazi material may be\nsignificantly more than 150. When NBC News conducted its review, Premium\nsubscribers had the option to hide their verification check marks from the\npublic.\n\nThe verified users sharing the pro-Nazi content have entered into a mutually\nbeneficial relationship with Musk\u2019s X, paying $8 a month or more for premium\nservices that are available to all premium subscribers. In exchange, they get\n\u201cprioritization\u201d when they reply to posts and the opportunity to monetize\ntheir content through ads, according to the subscription terms.\n\nThe result is that X is bringing Nazi sympathizers in from the dark corners of\nthe internet to a massive platform where they can pay to amplify their\ncontent. X had 174 million daily active users worldwide on its mobile app in\nFebruary, according to the research firm Sensor Tower. X claims to have many\nmore than that.\n\nNBC News conducted its research in March, before X implemented a change to\nprovide free premium subscriptions to accounts with more than 2,500 verified\nfollowers. That move has made it more difficult to determine who is a paid\nsubscriber.\n\nA welcoming social media environment can make Nazi sympathizers feel validated\nin their views and recruit others to their cause, said Patrick Riccards,\nexecutive director of Life After Hate, a Milwaukee-based organization that\nhelps people disengage from violent extremist groups.\n\n\u201cFor those who are already driven by hate, it is a big warm hug,\u201d he said.\n\nOnline hatred can also contribute to violence offline, he said, citing the\nracist massacre at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, where 10 Black people\ndied in 2022. The gunman wrote in a document that he supported neo-Nazism. He\nlater said in court that he \u201cbelieved what I read online and acted out the\nhate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re wanting to find individuals to take physical action when the time\ncomes,\u201d Riccards said.\n\nIn most cases, Nazi material on X is about spreading hate, said Megan Squire,\ndeputy director for data analytics at the Southern Poverty Law Center, an\nanti-hate group founded in 1971.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like historians are on there talking about Hitler\u2019s speeches,\u201d she\nsaid.\n\nSquire said that in her research she has found that accounts posting Nazi\nmaterial are run by \u201cknown white supremacist groups that are attempting to\nnormalize their ideas, gain followers and shuffle those followers into\nplatforms\u201d elsewhere online where their organizing work continues.\n\nBy failing to act against many pro-Nazi accounts, X continues to earn income\nfrom their activity in at least two ways: by collecting monthly subscription\nfees from those posting pro-Nazi content and by running advertisements on\nthose accounts or adjacent to the pro-Nazi content.\n\nNBC News found ads running on 74 of the 150 premium accounts, either on their\nprofile pages or in the replies below their posts. The advertisers included\nSiriusXM, The Hollywood Reporter and Cisco subsidiary Splunk. SiriusXM\ndeclined to comment. Penske Media, the owner of The Hollywood Reporter,\ndeclined to comment. Splunk did not respond to requests for comment sent by\nemail.\n\nAds from other companies appeared among the search results for a Holocaust-\ndenial hashtag.\n\nNBC News does not have a comprehensive list of advertisers that use X. Each\naccount on social media sees different ads at different times, so it is\nunknown how many advertisers\u2019 ads have run next to pro-Nazi content.\n\nAdvertisers online generally have limited control over where their ads appear.\nX says on a website for advertisers that it gives them the ability to target\ncertain demographics, accounts, keywords, phrases, interests, events and\nlocations. Advertisers can also use \u201cnegative\u201d targeting, asking X\u2019s ads\nsystem not to place ads near certain keywords. The system, however, does not\nguarantee placement next to or away from any specific post. Other platforms,\nsuch as Instagram, have targeting systems of their own.\n\nOn a second website for advertisers, X says its rules are meant to ensure\nbrand safety. It says that the rules \u201care enforced for all people who use X\u201d\nand that they \u201cset the standard for content and behavior not permitted on the\nplatform.\u201d X specifically notes on the page that its policies include rules\nthat address \u201cviolence,\u201d \u201cterrorism/violent extremism\u201d and \u201chateful conduct.\u201d\n\nX does not disclose publicly which accounts share in ad revenue, and NBC News\ncould not determine how many of the 150 premium subscribers do so.\n\nMonetizing Nazi content contradicts one of Musk\u2019s early pledges after he\nbought the app, then known as Twitter, in October 2022.\n\n\u201cNegative/hate tweets will be max deboosted & demonetized, so no ads or other\nrevenue to Twitter,\u201d he wrote in a post in November 2022.\n\n### Recommended\n\nBusiness News\n\n### Business NewsTesla job cuts heighten Wall Street concerns that EV maker\nfaces a demand problem\n\nTech News\n\n### Tech NewsA Cybertruck owner says his accelerator got stuck while he was\ndriving\n\nMusk also said then that no one has a right to amplification online.\n\n\u201cNew Twitter policy is freedom of speech, but not freedom of reach,\u201d he wrote.\n\nNBC News sought comment on its findings from X. A representative for X asked\nfor examples, and NBC News provided 13 examples of accounts posting pro-Nazi\ncontent. Hours later, X had put labels on some of the examples, all of which\nremained online. Representatives for X did not answer written questions or\nagree to an interview, but they sent a link to a blog post from September that\nsays X has a \u201czero tolerance approach\u201d to violent speech.\n\nMany of the 150 premium accounts have put links on their X profiles directing\npeople to their websites, books and other media, where they sometimes push\nNazi sympathy and antisemitism. One such account, using the name The Impartial\nTruth, posts recycled and remixed Nazi propaganda content, and its X profile\nlinks out to a donation site. The account did not respond to an emailed\nrequest for comment.\n\nOne of the premium accounts belongs to Stew Peters, a Florida-based host of an\ninternet talk show who has praised Nazi book-burning in 1930s Germany. Last\nmonth, a post of his denying the Holocaust went viral on X with 1.9 million\nviews. Peters has more than 574,000 followers on X, where his posts often\ninclude antisemitism, and his account links to his website charging $10 a\nmonth for videos. In response to a request for comment, Peters said NBC News\nwas using \u201cad hominem arguments to create narratives out of whole cloth.\u201d\n\nSome of the accounts posting Nazi propaganda are unabashed in their praise of\nthe Nazis. At least two verified X subscribers recently praised Joseph\nGoebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister. One said it used artificial\nintelligence to generate fake audio of Goebbels reading his writing aloud,\nbringing in more than 23,000 views.\n\nX\u2019s policies require a \u201csensitive media\u201d label for \u201chateful imagery,\u201d which\nincludes \u201csymbols historically associated with hate groups, e.g., the Nazi\nswastika.\u201d Musk cited a related \u201cincitement to violence\u201d policy when he\nsuspended the rapper Ye, formerly Kanye West, after Ye praised Hitler in an\ninterview and posted an image resembling a swastika.\n\nSome viral Nazi content stops short of praise and instead drives engagement to\naccounts with no clear ideology. Two examples came in March from the account\n@dom_lucre, a conspiracy theorist. It posted two Hitler speeches that together\nreceived more than 15 million views. The speeches were translated with\nartificial intelligence, Lucre said. He, unlike others, included a warning\nthat the speech was graphic and antisemitic, though he did not express\ndisapproval.\n\n\u201cI am simply sharing what is news as I always do,\u201d he wrote in a post. Lucre,\nwho also goes by Dominick McGee, according to his Facebook page, did not\nrespond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nLucre and other similar posters who stopped short of praising Nazis were not\nincluded in the NBC News count of the 150 premium subscribers posting pro-Nazi\ncontent. Those 150 accounts were more explicit in their pro-Nazi ideologies.\n\nSquire, of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said the proliferation of pro-Nazi\ncontent is the result of multiple decisions by Musk since he bought the\nplatform: cutting content moderators, changing the rules about who got\nverification, reinstating banned accounts and restricting the data stream that\noutside watchdogs used to research Twitter.\n\nMany researchers have complained that it is now difficult or impossible to\nmeasure the reach of extremism on X because of the new restrictions Musk has\nimposed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s safety through obscurity: Make it really hard for people to see the\nproblem, and then you can pretend it doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d Squire said.\n\nBefore Musk bought Twitter, it had been working for about five years to crack\ndown on the presence of Nazis. In 2017, after years of complaints by users and\nadvertisers, Twitter said it was banning Nazi swastikas and other hateful\nimagery from profile photos and that it would kick off users who associate\nwith violent organizations. Opponents of Nazis celebrated the moves as long\noverdue.\n\nSome prominent X users are unhappy with what they have seen. Christopher Rufo,\nan activist and senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, wrote\nlast month that he had seen a rise in \u201cKanye-style antisemitism.\u201d A\nrepresentative for Rufo said he was not available for an interview.\n\nSome Nazi supporters have also said they have noticed a rise in sympathetic\nposts. One account, referring to Hitler as \u201cthe Boss,\u201d wrote recently: \u201cI\u2019m\nseeing the Boss\u2019 speeches and quotes more and more on social media, from\npeople youd never expect.\u201d\n\nRather than crack down on antisemitic posts, Musk has used his massive\nplatform to promote antisemitic conspiracy theories. Last year, he embraced\nthe concept of the \u201cgreat replacement,\u201d which says there is a top-down plot to\nreplace the white population with nonwhite people. His posts on the subject\ndrew condemnation from the White House and led to an exodus of advertisers.\nFollowing the backlash over his statements, Musk visited Israel and traveled\nto the former Nazi death camp Auschwitz with conservative commentator Ben\nShapiro.\n\nMusk also reinstated the accounts of prominent neo-Nazis Andrew Anglin and\nNick Fuentes. Both are now suspended, although videos in which Fuentes\nquestions the Holocaust still spread widely on X.\n\nLast year, the progressive watchdog Media Matters published a report saying\nNazi content was running on X alongside advertisements from major\ncorporations. X sued Media Matters, saying its research was flawed because it\nused an account that, according to the company, was primed to see Nazi\nmaterial based on the accounts it followed. It also said Media Matters\nreceived flawed results because the activity of its researchers was atypical,\nfor example by refreshing a page many times to see which ads appeared. X\u2019s\nsuit is ongoing. In a statement to NBC News at the time, Media Matters\nPresident Angelo Carusone called the lawsuit \"frivolous\" and said the\norganization \"stands behind its reporting and looks forward to winning in\ncourt.\u201d\n\nAmong the ads running near pro-Nazi content seen by NBC News was one from the\nFBI seeking tips about hate crimes. The FBI ad appeared among the replies to a\npost from @AshaLogos, a verified account with more than 54,000 followers that\nfrequently posts antisemitism, including a recent accusation that Jews have a\n\u201cmonopoly\u201d on media.\n\nThe FBI did not respond to requests for comment on the ad or its placement or\nabout NBC News\u2019 findings about pro-Nazi propaganda on X.\n\nHate crime in the U.S. has been surging, with reports jumping 12% in 2021 and\n7% in 2022, according to law enforcement reports to the FBI.\n\nDavid Ingram\n\nDavid Ingram covers tech for NBC News.\n\nLora Kolodny, CNBC contributed.\n\n\u00a9 2024 NBC UNIVERSAL\n\nWe and our partners use cookies on this site to improve our service, perform\nanalytics, personalize advertising, measure advertising performance, and\nremember website preferences.
