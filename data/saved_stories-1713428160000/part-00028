Especially on my mobile\nphone. I know it's not just me experiencing this because I've observed some of\nthe very same mistakes I usually make in posts of others on social media, and\neven in print articles... Examples of it are found when I try to type words\nwith apostrophes like \"It's\", but in a lot of cases now, the apostrophe is\ncombined with the latter \"c\" on my phone keyboard. Any time I type a word\n(including an apostrophe) like \"It's\" it comes out incorrect like \"Itcs\" which\nis rather maddening, as for many years prior, it was never an issue. Many\nother simple words also don't get highlighted on Android OS for me when mis-\ntyped on my phone now, and with posts that can't properly be edited across\nsocial media, it can become quite disruptive and embarrassing to go back and\ndelete posts and retype them from scratch, especially when editing posts (as\nimplemented on certain apps like Twitter(X-ugh) is not an option.\n\nI can recall a time where it was essential, if not totally intuitive that\nspell check would highlight mis-spelled words, so that you could quickly\nproofread and edit incorrect words, and even grammar in some cases, before you\npublish posts, heck, highlighting is happening on many words I've mis-typed\nduring the process of writing this rant on desktop, so there's that... There\nis no way I'd attempt to write posts here on anything other than a desktop\ncomputer, not just because mobile & tablet screens are far too small, but\nBECAUSE I've found spell check to be far too embarrassingly faulty on Android\nfor at least the past 2 years to get serious writing work done on the mobile\nOS.\n\nAs I replied to an email today, I had a revelation that with the proliferation\nof new Ai tools (many generated by the same companies that manage the\nproductivity and social tools we use) it would be too easy for many of these\ncompanies to have no incentive to continue developing human-centric tools in\nfavor of creating Ai-based tools, as poor human work only serves to make Ai\nlook better. In many ways now, I think we lose sight of how tiny strategic\nmoves by tech industry can have far reaching and serious impacts, and that can\ninfluence the outcome of our future greatly and even to a perilous outcome.\n\nNow more than ever, we need to take steps and be vigilant and vocal when we\nobserve human-focused productivity tools that have flaws within them,\nespecially the more serious flaws in functionality, efficiency, and accuracy.\nWe need to ensure that we, as humans (creatively and analytically) are not\nbeing handicapped in even the most subtle ways... As computing power has been\nincreasing, testing methods are well established, and as automated (and even\nhuman) development methods have been taking leaps forward, there' is slowly\nbecoming less and less excuse for flawed function and features in mission-\ncritical hardware and software. I have written here before about the process\nin which many companies up-sell software (in tiers of operation) through\nlimiting functionality of each edition, but this write-up is citing cases\nwhere software might be intentionally and covertly reinforcing a more\ntechnical conflict of interest in a strategic business capacity completely\ndifferent, and potentially far more toxic than just a forced update... Many\nhuman employees can lose their jobs as a result of an artificially skewed\noperating field, and the results can be devastating in the long term if we are\nnot aware and vigilant of this type of conflict.\n\nJust for example, if you can consider calculator software... We have had\ncalculators for many years, some hardware and even software ones, they are\ninexpensive now due to market saturation of course... If each company that\ndeveloped calculators wanted to renew their revenue streams and raise prices,\none could say a deeply \"calculating\" strategy would be to develop an automated\naccountant service... So if every dominant calculator maker in the industry\nbegan to develop automated (Ai subscription based service)\ncalculating/budgeting software tools, and in order to insure adoption of the\nnew automated (monthly subscription automated \"Ai accountant\" service) they\nsecretly began introducing flaws slowly into their traditional (human-\noperated) tools, or even stop innovating upon those tools altogether --\nSuddenly the shiny new Ai service would appear to be far more accurate,\npossibly faster, and more essential than human laborers, as humans lose their\nability to trust prior tools based on flawed output or functionality...\n\nI have even seen certain hardware tools, like even keyboards that add to\nmalfunction, as they latest one I bought has inverted symbol keys that make me\nlook stupid when I try to type [brackets] instead of {braces} involving the\nshift key.... That may be a bit further of a conspiracy stretch though, but it\ncan happen nonetheless to sabotage human work as well in other ways. I have\nnoticed tools I've used for many years to make music take long periods of time\nto load, despite now running on much faster hardware, and sometimes not\nloading properly at all... If I had to compete in a speed contest with an Ai\nmusic generator, I might not even be able to keep up with it's speed because\nof the handicapped performance of tools which should be running much faster\nthan they used to on even brand new hardware... A lot of my software gets\nslower after updates a lot of the time too, and few updates on a Digital Audio\nWorkstation pertain to security, so it's quite confusing as to why loading is\nnot faster over time with upgrades.\n\nCompanies need to test their IT products properly, and reassure us as humans,\nthat our ability to do work as well always will be supported properly by their\nproductivity tools... Companies need to commit to improving tools over time,\nand announcing when they can't be properly supported. For mission-critical\ntools, companies should possibly be required to transition/sell them to\nentities that can uphold support when they can't be maintained properly\n(especially if they are uniquely essential to individuals and businesses).\n\nFor a non-technical example, if only one company made all the word's shovels\n(that humans could use to dig) for decades, but then decided to make only\nexpensive tractors that could dig posts, and completely stopped making all\nshovels for humans in favor of only selling far more expensive tractors,\npeople would call it unfair for sure (if they have brains). The tractor\ncompany would see it as their right perhaps, but their actions would result in\nmany being laid off, and a quite instable hole digging industry... Now imagine\nthat scenario placed upon the entire computer software and hardware industry,\nand it becomes far more serious perhaps...\n\nThe real conflict is mainly that many companies involved in supporting humans\npossibly congruently face a conflict of interest in terms of launching their\nown Ai products, because then a company's supported clients are potentially\nturned into competition by that move (because they more often than not\nleverage human labor) and they also turn into potential customers for the new\nAi service, so they are then marketed a tool they cannot refuse citing that\ntheir employees cannot work properly on unknowingly flawed tools.\n\nAi tools, as they are to this day, still require a lot of human intervention\nand oversight, there is not a vast amount of tools in service that run\ncompletely autonomously (especially mission critical tools). In vetting a\nsupply chain as well for your business needs, it's extremely important to vet\nsuppliers from all angles (not just technical proficiency) to make sure the\nvery companies & individuals that you rely on aren't also setting you up to be\nlocked into influence of and dependency upon them. As we begin to adopt Ai, we\nalso cannot ever underestimate the oversight and accountability involved, and\nin my opinion, at this point, proper, ethical, and accountable human oversight\nis still mission critical to business in almost every aspect of technology to\nthis day.\n\nWe've got to hold companies accountable for not improving human tools\nproperly. These are the very same tools we will need to audit Ai as it becomes\nmore prevalent. My father always used to say - Those who forget the past are\ncondemned to repeat it... There are many real cases in our history where\nhubris and over confidence in technology have led to quite catastrophic\nresults (The Hindenburg, The Titanic, The Movie WaterWorld, Self Driving Cars\nOn highways and in snow, That \"Ai badge pin\" thing). Let's not set ourselves\nup for any new cases. Stop dumbing down our human-centered (non-Ai) tools (and\nkeep your filthy & greedy monthly-fee grubbin' hands off them as well).\n\nTop\n\nPost Reply\n\n  * Print view\n\n1 post \u2022 Page 1 of 1\n\nReturn to \u201cDiscussions\u201d\n\n  * Board index\n  * All times are UTC\n  * Delete cookies\n\n\u00a9 2017 CircuitBored.Com.
