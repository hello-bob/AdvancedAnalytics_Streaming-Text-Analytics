In\ncontrast, the number of people actively seeking a job increased to a new high\nwhich was only superseded by the spike at the beginning of the COVID pandemic.\n\nComparing the Hacker News data to the FRED (St. Louis FED) data, the decline\nin job postings does not only appear steeper but has also set in earlier in\ntech compared to the overall private sector.\n\nIf we (falsely) assume all of the job postings led to a newly created job (and\ndid not replace any), we\u2019d see the disparity between the overall private\nsector and the tech sector already begins mid-2021.\n\nIs all of that an expression of corporate greed? Like, software companies\noperate on high margins, and thus, any position cuts would result in higher\nearnings per share?\n\nSince 2023 (after a sharp decline) that seems to be the case for NASDAQ 100\n(for lack of a better proxy for the tech industry).\n\nHowever, earnings per share do not reflect such a steep rise, meaning that the\noperating margin is not increasing and in fact, ranging below the five-year\nmean.\n\nCould it just be that the tech industry is not \u201cnew\u201d anymore? And just part of\nthe \u201cnormal\u201d economy? That there is not a big disparity between \u201cold economy\u201d\nand \u201cnew markets\u201d?\n\nStill, tech operates on higher OpEx and thus, is more sensitive to changes in\ninterest rates.\n\n##\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Tech Trends\n\nHere are some interesting charts on the relative importance of different\ntechnologies mentioned in Hacker News \u201cwhoishiring\u201d posts over time:\n\n##\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 More headlines\n\n  * Open Sourcing DOS 4\n\n  * Google has laid off their Python Foundation team\n\n  * ByteDance 'would rather' torpedo TikTok than sell it off\n\n  * Oracle\u2019s Jump to Nashville Surprises Austin\n\n##\n\n\ud83d\ude80 What else?\n\nI have changed this newsletter from \u201coccasional\u201d to at least once every two\nweeks. The new format not only contains curated news and insights from the\ntech world but also sets the stage for fellow developers.\n\nI will ask people about their journeys in the tech world and also in life. I\u2019m\npretty sure there is much to learn from listening to other people\u2019s\nexperiences, and I am excited to share that with you!\n\nOf course, I need your help with this.\n\nPlease tell me if you want to share your story with my 600+ readers!\n\n  * What is something you learned?\n\n  * What are some books that recently influenced you?\n\n  * What do you want to share with others about your life, your productivity, your career, and your health?\n\nReach out to me on this form.\n\nLet me know how I can make the newsletter better.\n\nI set up a short feedback form here.\n\nIt would mean the world to me if you spent a minute or two filling it out!\n\nBest,\n\nThanks for reading Bas' Take on Tech!
