Internet Archive\" lawsuit (for which, judgment was handed\ndown, against Internet Archive, last year).\n\nWhat is curious, is that this final brief fails -- almost completely -- to\nreasonably address the core issues of the lawsuit. What's more, the public\nstatements that followed, by The Internet Archive, appeared to be crafted to\ndrum up public sympathy by misrepresenting the core of the case itself.\n\nWhich suggests that The Internet Archive is very much aware that they are\nlikely to lose this appeal.\n\nAfter a careful reading of the existing public documents relating to this\ncase... it truly is difficult to come to any other conclusion.\n\nThe Internet Archive does some critically important work by archiving, and\nindexing, a wide variety of culturally significant material (from webpages to\ndecades old magazine articles). In this work, they help to preserve history. A\nextremely noble, and valuable, endeavor. Which makes the likelihood of this\nlegal defeat all the more unfortunate.\n\n###\n\nWhat is \"Hachette v. Internet Archive\"?\n\nHere's the short-short version of this lawsuit:\n\nThe Internet Archive created a program they called \"Controlled Digital\nLending\" (CDL) -- where a physical book is scanned, turned into a digital\nfile, and that digital file is then \"loaned\" out to people on the Internet. In\n2020, The Internet Archive removed what few restrictions existed with this\nDigital Lending program, allowing an unlimited number of people to download\nthe digital copy of a book.\n\nThe result was a group of publishers filing the \"Hachette v. Internet Archive\"\nlawsuit. That lawsuit focused on two key complaints:\n\n  1. The books were \"digitized\" (converted from physical to digital form) -- and distributed -- without the permission of the copyright holders (publishers, authors, etc.).\n\n  2. The Internet Archive received monetary donations (and other monetary rewards) as a result of freely distributing said copyrighted material. Again, without permission of the copyright holders. Effectively making the Internet Archive's CDL a commercial enterprise for the distribution of what is best described as \"pirated material\".\n\nThat lawsuit was decided, against The Internet Archive, in 2023 -- with the\njudge declaring that \"no case or legal principle supports\" their defense of\n\"Fair Use\".\n\nThat judgment was appealed by The Internet Archive. Which brings us to today,\nand thier final defense (in theory).\n\n###\n\nWhat is the final defense of The Internet Archive?\n\nLet's take a look at the final brief in The Internet Archive's bid to appeal\nthis ruling.\n\nRead the full article\n\n> The full article is available \u2014 for free \u2014 over at Lunduke.Locals.com (the\n> main site for The Lunduke Journal).\n\n1 Like\n\n\u00b7\n\n1 Restack\n\n1\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Internet Archive's last-ditch effort to save itself\n\nlunduke.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nThe computers used to do 3D animation for Final Fantasy VII... in 1996.\n\nIt's time for a little dive into mid-1990s computer history!\n\nApr 6, 2022 \u2022\n\nBryan Lunduke\n\n35\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The computers used to do 3D animation for Final Fantasy VII... in 1996.\n\nlunduke.substack.com\n\n2\n\nLinus Torvalds threatens to punish developers by putting Rust in the Linux\nKernel\n\nLinux would join Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook in usage of Rust as a\ndisciplinary tool.\n\nJun 26, 2022 \u2022\n\nBryan Lunduke\n\n38\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Linus Torvalds threatens to punish developers by putting Rust in the\nLinux Kernel\n\nlunduke.substack.com\n\n5\n\nMake Linux look exactly like Windows 95...
