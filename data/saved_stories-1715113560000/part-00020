That\u2019s what\u2019s causing the greatest abundance of\ntrash.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian approached Altria, Philip Morris International, Danone, Nestl\u00e9,\nPepsiCo and The Coca-Cola Company.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company said: \u201cWe care about the impact of every drink we sell\nand are committed to growing our business in the right way.\u201d It has pledged to\nmake 100% of its packaging recyclable globally by 2025, and to use at least\n50% recycled material in packaging by 2030.\n\nNestl\u00e9 said it has reduced its virgin plastic usage by 14.9% in the last five\nyears, and supports schemes around the world to develop waste collection and\nrecycling schemes.\n\n\u201cSince launching our voluntary commitments to address plastic waste five years\nago, we have significantly outperformed the market at large in reducing virgin\nplastic and increasing recyclability, according to the most recent report from\nthe Ellen MacArthur Foundation,\u201d it said.\n\nThe company also supports the creation of a global legally binding regulation\non plastic pollution which is being negotiated this week.\n\nDanone said: \u201cWe continue to strive to reduce our own plastic footprint \u2013\nbetween 2018-2023 we reduced our plastic use by 8% equivalent to 62 000 tons\nand increased the recyclability of our packaging (84% of our packaging is\nrecyclable, reusable or compostable). We continue to support and push for\nimproved collection and recycling infrastructures to help consumers recycle.\u201d\nThey also support \u201can ambitious and binding ... UN Global Plastic Treaty which\nwould represent a major opportunity to unlock and accelerate progress on\nplastics circularity.\u201d\n\nBoth PMI and Altria contest the accuracy of the data collected.\n\nPlastic in the Depths: how pollution took over our oceans\n\nRead more\n\nHowever, while many of these companies have taken voluntary measures to\nimprove their impact on plastic pollution, the experts behind the study argue\nthey are not working. Plastic production has doubled since the beginning of\n2000 and studies show only 9% of plastic is being recycled.\n\nWhen the team collected data on self-reported yearly plastic packaging\nproduction for each of these multinational companies and compared it with the\ndata from their 1,500-plus litter surveys, their statistical analysis showed\nthat every 1% increase in plastic production was directly correlated with\napproximately a 1% increase in plastic pollution.\n\n\u201cActually seeing this one-to-one increase, I was like, wow,\u201d says a study\nauthor, Kathy Willis, a marine socio-ecologist from the Commonwealth\nScientific and Industrial Research Organisation in Australia.\n\n\u201cTime and time again from our science we see that we really need to be capping\nhow much plastic we are producing.\u201d\n\nHowever, Kartik Chandran, an environmental engineer at Columbia University,\nwho was not involved in the research, said that while this new data was\nstriking, the observation that 1% plastic production was equal to 1% plastic\npollution was \u201ca bit unrealistic\u201d and \u201csimplistic\u201d.\n\nHe said the data did not consider plastic pollution in China, Korea and Japan,\nnor take into consideration recycling or clean-up initiatives under way.\n\nA better analysis could be based on the net plastic flows into plastic\nproduction \u2013 also accounting for credits from the reuse of plastic materials \u2013\nand the net plastic load ascribed as plastic pollution.\n\nThe team behind the study, some of whom are participating in the talks being\nheld in Ottawa this week to discuss a UN Treaty for Plastic Pollution, said\ntheir findings emphasised the urgent need for a globally binding treaty\nfocusing on production measures.\n\nThe talks will run to Monday, and Luis Vayas Valdivieso, the Ecuadorian\nambassador to the UK, told the Guardian earlier this week he was hopeful that\ncountries would come together to secure an international legally binding\ninstrument on plastic pollution.\n\n\u201cIt is very important we are negotiating this treaty now. The world is in a\ntriple crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. But while\nthere are agreements in place for the first two, we have no legislation, no\nglobal agreement on plastic pollution.\u201d\n\nThis article was amended on 25 April 2024 to include the tobacco company\nAltria. In 2003 the Philip Morris Company renamed itself Altria. In 2008\nPhilip Morris International became a separate entity. However, Philip Morris\nUS is still owned by Altria. It was further amended on 26 April 2024 to add\nthat both PMI and Altria contest the accuracy of the data collected.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Plastics\n  * Pollution\n  * Nestl\u00e9\n  * Pepsico\n  * Coca-Cola\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Developed countries accused of bowing to lobbyists at plastic pollution talks\n\n30 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### \n\nScience Weekly\n\nThe stream of plastic pollution: could a global treaty help us turn off the\ntap? \u2013 podcast\n\n30 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Countries consider pact to reduce plastic production by 40% in 15 years\n\n29 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### World must come together to tackle plastic pollution, says chair of UN talks\n\n23 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Plastic-production emissions could triple to one-fifth of Earth\u2019s carbon budget \u2013 report\n\n18 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Microscopic plastics could raise risk of stroke and heart attack, study says\n\n6 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Plastic waste \u2018spiralling out of control\u2019 across Africa, analysis shows\n\n8 Nov 2023\n\n  * ### EU to crack down further on microplastics after glitter ban\n\n17 Oct 2023\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Environment\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Wildlife\n  * Energy\n  * Pollution\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
