Two years ago, modern machine learning\ntechniques were rarely being applied to make weather forecasts. Now we have\nmultiple models that can produce 10-day global forecasts in minutes.\n\n\u201cThere is a great deal we can learn about AI weather forecasts by stress-\ntesting them on extreme events like Storm Ciar\u00e1n. We can identify their\nstrengths and weaknesses and guide the development of even better AI\nforecasting technology to help protect people and property. This is an\nexciting and important time for weather forecasting.\u201d\n\nPromise and pitfalls\n\nTo understand the effectiveness of AI-based weather models, scientists from\nthe University of Reading compared AI and physics-based forecasts of Storm\nCiar\u00e1n - a deadly windstorm that hit northern and central Europe in November\n2023 which claimed 16 lives in northern Europe and left more than a million\nhomes without power in France.\n\nThe researchers used four AI models and compared their results with\ntraditional physics-based models. The AI models, developed by tech giants like\nGoogle, Nvidia and Huawei, were able to predict the storm's rapid\nintensification and track 48 hours in advance. To a large extent, the\nforecasts were \u2018indistinguishable\u2019 from the performance of conventional\nforecasting models, the researchers said. The AI models also accurately\ncaptured the large-scale atmospheric conditions that fuelled Ciar\u00e1n's\nexplosive development, such as its position relative to the jet stream \u2013 a\nnarrow corridor of strong high-level winds.\n\nThe machine learning technology underestimated the storm's damaging winds,\nhowever. All four AI systems underestimated Ciar\u00e1n's maximum wind speeds,\nwhich in reality gusted at speeds of up to 111 knots at Pointe du Raz,\nBrittany. The authors were able to show that this underestimation was linked\nto some of the features of the storm, including the temperature contrasts near\nits centre, that were not well predicted by the AI systems.\n\nTo better protect people from extreme weather like Storm Ciaran, the\nresearchers say further investigation of the use of AI in weather prediction\nis urgently needed. Development of machine learning models could mean\nartificial intelligence is routinely used in weather prediction in the near\nfuture, saving forecasters time and money.\n\n10.1038/s41612-024-00638-w\n\nImage: Storm Ciaran batters Newhaven Harbour, East Sussex, November 2023.\nImage via Flickr user Howard Stanbury.
