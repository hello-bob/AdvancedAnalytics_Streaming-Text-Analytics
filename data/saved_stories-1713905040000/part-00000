Our\nclosest video journalist was Chicago-based Robert Ray, who dropped his plans\nto travel to Georgia for Super Tuesday, booked several flights to the cities\nclosest to the strikes and headed for the airport. He\u2019d decide once there\nwhich flight to take. He never got on board a plane. Instead, he ended up\ndriving toward Harrisburg, Ill., where initial reports suggested a town was\ndestroyed. That decision turned out to be a lucky break for the AP. Twice. Ray\nwas among the first journalists to arrive and he confirmed those reports -- in\nall formats. He shot powerful video, put victims on the phone with AP Radio\nand played back sound to an editor who transcribed the interviews and put the\nmaterial on text wires. He then walked around the devastation with the Central\nRegional Desk on the line, talking to victims with the phone held so close\nthat editors could transcribe his interviews in real time. Ray also made a\ndramatic image of a young girl who found a man\u2019s prosthetic leg in the rubble,\npropped it up next to her destroyed home and spray-painted an impromptu sign:\n\u201cFound leg. Seriously.\u201d The following day, he was back on the road and headed\nfor Georgia and a Super Tuesday date with Newt Gingrich\u2019s campaign. The drive\nwould take him through a stretch of the South that forecasters expected would\nsuffer another wave of tornadoes. To prevent running into THAT storm, Ray used\nhis iPhone to monitor Doppler radar, zooming in on extreme cells and using\nGoogle maps to direct himself to safe routes. And then the journalist took\nover again. \u201cWhen weather like that occurs, a reporter must seize the\nopportunity to get the news out and allow people to see, hear and read the\npower of nature so that they can take proper shelter,\u201d Ray says. So Ray now\nstarted to use his phone to follow the storms. He attached a small GoPro\ncamera to his steering wheel in case a tornado dropped down in front of the\ncar somewhere, and took video of heavy rain and hail with his iPhone. Soon, he\nspotted a tornado and the chase was on. He followed an unmarked emergency\nvehicle to Cleveland, Tenn., where he was first on the scene of the storm's\naftermath. Again, the tornadoes had struck in locations that were hours from\nthe nearest AP bureau. Damage and debris, as well as a wickedly violent storm\nthat made travel dangerous, slowed our efforts to get to the news. That wasn\u2019t\na problem in Tennessee, where our customers were well served by an all-formats\nreport that included this text story. \u201cCLEVELAND, Tenn. (AP) _ Fierce wind,\nhail and rain lashed Tennessee for the second time in three days, and at least\n15 people were hospitalized Friday in the Chattanooga area.\u201d The byline?\nRobert Ray. For being adept with technology, chasing after news as it\nliterally dropped from the sky and setting a standard for all-formats\nreporting that put the AP ahead on the most competitive news story of the day,\nRay wins this week\u2019s $300 Best of the States prize. \u00a9 2013 The Associated\nPress.

Someone told me this and I checked it out. Turns out it\u2019s true.\nIt seems as though your adrenal glands are kind of like those British Royal\nGuards with the big, black fuzzy hats who stand like statues in front of\nBuckingham Palace. They just stand there quietly, not doing much really, just\nenjoying the brown, slippery beach that is your kidneys. However, if anything\nstartling should happen that requires your attention \u2014 like say you\u2019re about\nto give a speech at a wedding or your hear a twig crack outside your tent or\nyour doorbell rings in the middle of the night \u2014 then they leap into action,\njumping out of their peaceful slumber to squeeze out a big dose of adrenaline\nright into your body, pumping you up, and turning you into a primal, warrior-\nlike version of yourself. When tension runs high and adrenaline is secreted\ninto your body some crazy things can happen \u2014 sometimes called the fight-or-\nflight response: - Your heart rate increases. And specifically, your body\nstarts sending blood to all your big muscles and diverts it away from \u201cnon-\ncritical\u201d parts of your body, like your brain, immune system, and digestive\nsystem. I guess someone figured you could digest the sandwich after you killed\nthe bear. - Your pupils dilate and you get tunnel vision. Quite literally,\nadrenaline also reduces your peripheral vision, which together with your big,\nwide pupils helps you focus on what lies ahead. You can\u2019t quite see through\nwalls, but if a crow is diving at your eyes you might be able to swat it away\nbetter. - Your body gets ready to boot it. In addition to the rising heart\nrate, your body starts turning lots more stuff into sugar, raising your blood\nsugar level and filling you with energy. You might not even feel pain as\neasily, so the raspberry bushes that shred your legs when you\u2019re running out\nof the forest won\u2019t slow you down. But what\u2019s also great about adrenalin is\nthat, first of all, you don\u2019t have to control it. It just sort of kicks it\ninto high gear when it figures you could use a boost. I think it\u2019s kind of\ncool knowing that your body will help you out when you need it most. Punch me\nin the face and suddenly my internal British Royal Guard tosses away his\nfuzzy, black cap, cracks his neck, and rolls up his sleeves. And really, isn\u2019t\nit that little dose of adrenalin that helps you do a better job when you need\nit most? It\u2019s a natural upper, helping you nail the big speech, ace the final\nexam, or perhaps flee both of those scenes. There\u2019s a reason some people\nbecome adrenaline junkies. The boost you get from your adrenal glands waking\nup and getting out of bed is intoxicating. Sure, it fuzzes up your thinking a\nbit and sends your intestines on sabbatical, but it sure does pump you up. And\nremember: when something important in your life is about to happen, you can\ncount on your good pal adrenaline to be there, juicing you up, helping you\nfight the good fight. Jian Ghomeshi is the host of my favorite radio show.\nIt\u2019s called Q and broadcasts across North America every morning. Jian is a big\nfriend and fan of 1000 Awesome Things and The Book of Awesome and I\u2019m really\nexcited because he just released his first book. It\u2019s called 1982 and is a\nbeautifully written memoir about growing up in the suburbs of Toronto and\ntrying to fit in. (My kind of book!)

The water. The Atlantic Ocean, as deep and true\nas denim, so blue it melts into the sky, horizonless. And the Charles River.\nYears from now, I\u2019ll remember riding the Red Line from Boston into Cambridge\nat night \u2013 the way the lights streak across the black water like crayons lined\nup in a box. After my childhood in Seattle to my college years in Boston, I\ndon\u2019t think I could live anywhere but a coast. 2. The seasons. I always come\nback to school right at the tail end of summer. Heat sinks into the subway\nstations like poisonous gas, and whatever you wear, it\u2019s too much fabric. With\nOctober right around the corner, though, fall settles in. I love the way\ngolden light fans out from behind buildings and through alleyways. Yellow\nleaves get stuck in the rain currents along the sidewalk. It\u2019s my favorite\ntime of year. Boston has also taught me the true meaning of winter. Winter is\nwet hair freezing solid on the way to class, two pairs of socks, ears tucked\ninto scarves. Torrential flurries of snowflakes that burn skin. Frankly,\nwinter is miserable. But then there\u2019s that one morning \u2013 and it\u2019s always a\nmorning, and you\u2019re never quite prepared for it \u2013 when you step outside and\nevery tree in Boston has bloomed. Cherry blossoms opened like pale pink\npopcorn, blue skies, tender green leaves. It\u2019s such a miracle that this can\nhappen despite the sheets of ice and crazy wind tunnels, it makes everything\nworthwhile. 3. The quirkiness. I love the farmer\u2019s markets all over the city,\nthe narrow brick alleys begging to be explored, the late night restaurants in\nChinatown. Boston constantly surprises me. Today I discovered the food trucks\n\u2013 why didn\u2019t I know that Boston has food trucks?? 4. The history. A handful of\nthe founding fathers are buried mere blocks from campus. I walk through the\noldest park in America to get to my boyfriend D-\u2019s apartment in Beacon Hill, a\nneighborhood of gas lamps and weathered brick. Everywhere you look, historic\nchurches stand between skyscrapers. The contrast is astonishing. 5. These\namazing people. Sure, most of them aren\u2019t from Boston. A-\u2019s from Colorado,\nC-\u2019s from LA, and S- is all the way from Guam. But nine months of the year,\nthey\u2019re all mine. They make Boston feel like home.

Butterworth June 19, 1924 Ty Cobb can tell you. Personally\ncausing your team's loss when you are managing said team can be a devastating\nturn of events. Players who look to you for leadership and support are left in\na rudderless abyss and often need to find dry morning land on their own. Such\nwas the case at Navin Field today, as the suddenly resurgent Indians re-\nvisited our neighborhood, fresh from taking three of four from the Yankees and\nbefore that, four straight from Boston. It was their misfortune, though, to\nrun into the Earl of Whitehill, who has been spinning masterpieces of hurling\nlately. Skipper Speaker doubled off him with two outs in the 1st, but Riggs\nStephenson, back from an ailment, left him there with a short fly. Joe Sewell\nand Speaker singled with two outs again two innings later, but this time Riggs\ngrounded out. Meanwhile Harry Heilman, hero of yesterday, was stranding\nrunners aplenty for our side, failing after three straight Fred Haney hits off\nJoe Shaute. The game remained scoreless through the first six frames, a\nremarkable achievement when one considers the power of these clubs' collective\nclout. With one out in the Tiger 7th, though, Frank O'Rourke reached on his\nthird single. Whitehill then lofted a fly straight out to Speaker. The sun had\nbeen playing peek-and-seek all afternoon behind thin clouds, and as the ball\nreached its pinnacle it was evident Tris was having trouble locating it. Sure\nenough, he threw up his mitt at the last moment and was as stunned as the\nthousands of witnesses were to have it nick off the top and bound insanely\ntoward the deep fence. By the time he tracked down the sphere, O'Rourke had\nscampered home and Whitehill was standing on third base. Shaute was visibly\nunnerved, threw a muffin-ball to Rigney, and Topper rammed it into the corner\nfor a double and 2-0 lead! Egg still dripping down his face, Speaker singled\nwith one out in the 8th, Stephenson followed with one of his own, but the Earl\ninduced a twin killing off the bat of George Burns to end the threat. Another\nminor disturbance went by the wayside in the 9th, Whitehill had his tidy\n10-hit shutout, and Detroit had won six games in a row. Cobb was thrilled\nlater about the result. \"Home runs? Who needs 'em? We got more line hits in\nour bureau than a buccaneer's got dubloons in the sand.\" Someone mentioned the\nerror by Speaker was a lucky break and Cobb froze the reporter with a baleful\nstare before ducking into the nearest shower stall. CLE 000 000 000 - 0 10 1\nDET 000 000 20x - 2 8 0 Only other American League game today: at BROWNS\n10-14-0, WHITE SOX 8-10-2 One of the more thrilling spectacles of this or any\nyear, and no one expected it. The Chicagos have had their way with St. Louis\nall season, and with Sloppy Thurston staked to a 6-2 after three on the\nhorrific Ray Kolp, Brownie fans were already making their dinner plans. It was\nactually 8-2 in the last of the 6th when four Browns singles and a key flub\nfrom Bill Barrett gave St. Louis four runs and put them back in the contest. A\nPat Collins single in the 8th pulled them to 8-7, as great relief twirling\nfrom George Grant and Hub Pruett kept matters close. But after Tobin and\npinch-hitter Severeid both singled to begin the last of the 9th, up stepped\nfamous batsman George Sisler. He picked out a Thurston curve, swung mightily\nand cracked it on a magnificent arc out to right. Hooper gave chase but ran\nout of room as the ball dropped into the Sportsman Park pavilion amidst a\ngaggle of celebrating fans. Washington will be in Shibe Park tomorrow, now\nwith a 2-game advantage, while the Red Sox will take their losing streak into\nYankee Stadium. |AMERICAN LEAGUE through Thursday, June 19| |Chicago White\nSox||38||25||.603||2| |New York Yankees||31||31||.500||8.5| |St. Louis\nBrowns||27||36||.429||13| |Boston Red Sox||24||37||.393||15||\n<urn:uuid:2c08e1d4-9706-41d8-84dc-ee2939758c81>| CC-MAIN-2013-20|\nhttp://1924andyouarethere.blogspot.com/2009_07_01_archive.html|\n2013-05-18T05:54:12Z| s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-\nMAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-\nMAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz| en| 0.964752|\n979  \n|Tommy Pi - Trance Experience| |Written by Paul| Tommy Pi started DJing at\nsmall private parties at the age of 13. He was always into music, so it was no\nsurprise when he went on and bought his first equipment, some Omnictronic\nTurntables and a small Gemini mixer. From that day on he always used any\nchance he got to play at parties, and it wasn't long before his day would\ncome, for him play on a big stage in front of more than 50 people! There was a\nbig party in his home town of Minden (North Germany) with DJ's like Monika\nKruse, Alex L\u00fcck and others and Tommy thought that it would be great to play\nthere. So he went straight to the promotor and said 'Hey man, I'm from here,\nI'm a DJ, too so can I play?'Not thinking that this would ever be possible,\nthe promotor said, 'Ok, just come here tomorrow, and you can play for an\nhour'. That was the birth of DJ Tommy Pi. From then on, Tommy played in clubs\nlike PW1 in Porta Westfalica, or Go!Parc in Herford. He also played the\nGo!Parc on Tour Events alongside Alex L\u00fcck and others. The biggest day was yet\nto come! On 21st of October 2000 Tommy and his mate Dee-B had the chance to\nplay alongside Piet Blank at the Einslive Party in Minden, invited by Piet\nhimself. It was a big party and Tommy was very nervous and shaking as he put\nthe needle on the vinyl for the first record 'DJ Culture'. He played on that\nevening and the crowd were fantastic and it was a lot of fun for both, Tommy\nand Dennis. The crowning Glory for Tommy was in 2002 when he was voted as\n'Best DJ' by the local magazine 'Stadtgefl\u00fcster'. Tommy was the second DJ to\nwin this trophy, after Timo Maas won it the year before. In 2003 Tommy started\nhis weekly Radio Show 'Trance Experience' on PureDJ. The show is streamed\nevery Monday from 8-10 pm CET. Now, 1Mix is rebroadcasting the show from\nOctober 2008 Tuesdays from 4-6pm. In February 2005 Tommy's second Radio Show\n'Trance Experience ETN Edition' was started on ETN.fm as a monthly one-hour\nradio show. All of Tommy's mixes and Radio Shows are now available as a\nPodcast on iTunes,podcast.de or mypodcast.com.|\n<urn:uuid:7e6216ca-0a01-498d-85f7-7d4aed299c98>| CC-MAIN-2013-20|\nhttp://1mix.co.uk/trance-shows/tommy-pi-trance-experience.html|\n2013-05-18T05:54:17Z| s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-\nMAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-\nMAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz| en| 0.985657|\n527  \nWhen I found out we would be getting a PopATot for review I was excited! I\nknew before we even had it that we would like it, but I had no idea how much\nwe would LOVE it! I am so excited to share this amazing product with you all!\nPopATot was created by parents, Evan and Stacy, who have 5 children! I\npersonally think this idea is wonderful. When I was trying to describe to my\nhusband what was coming in the mail for Ladybug, I described it as a cross\nbetween a card table, an exersaucer, and a fabric folding chair. He sort of\ngot it, but when he finally saw it he totally understood my references!!! I\nwill let our many photos of Ladybug speak mostly for themselves (she is 5\n1/2-6 months in all of these photos). We use this thing every day now, and in\nmany different places throughout each day-it is that easy to move around. My\nabsolute favorite use for the PopATot is in our schoolroom. We have a fairly\nsmall schoolroom and I only need to have Ladybug in there sometimes, so I\ndon't want a big baby item in there. PopATot is perfect because I can set it\nup and take it down quickly! My bedroom is another of those places! She hangs\nout in my room often like this now!! We have a 2nd story deck off of our\nbedroom, and the PopATot is perfect for the deck!!! We can't fit anything else\nout the small door, let alone leave something big out there in the weather.\nThis is wonderful! I set Ladybug up in the middle and the boys ride all around\nher on their riding toys! She's all smiles and cuteness!!! Pac Man likes the\nPopATot too ;) I am so excited that one of YOU is going to win this awesome\nbaby item, just in time for the holiday season.

Dividends Hang in the Balance\n(ATK, GD, LLL, LMT, RTN)December 28, 2011 by Jon C. Ogg It is no secret that\nIran is a saber-rattling nation. The country wants to be relevant on the\nglobal stage so much that it keeps up with its nuclear ambitions regardless of\nglobal trading sanctions and regardless of efforts from the Western nations\ntrying to stop it. And now the big news is not the nuclear front, but an\nIranian minister claiming that Iran could effectively block the flow of\ntraffic through the Gulf of Hormuz easier than drinking a glass of water. In\nthe age of austerity and military budgets being slashed to deal with deficits,\nIran has a chance of turning 2012 accidentally into the year of defense\nstocks. Alliant Techsystems Inc. (NYSE: ATK), General Dynamics Corp. (NYSE:\nGD), L-3 Communications Holdings Inc. (NYSE: LLL), Lockheed Martin Corporation\n(NYSE: LMT) and Raytheon Co. (NYSE: RTN) could all hang in the balance. With\noperations all but gone in Iraq and with the trend in Afghanistan being one of\nleaving, Iran is the obvious wild card. If anything real ever comes out of\nIran\u2019s religious political leadership other than how neat it is to stone\npeople over adultery, how it denies that alternative lifestyles exist in Iran,\nor about how it wants nuclear power for peace, this may end up making the\nsell-off seen in defense stocks a bargain of the century. If (or when) Iran\never announces that it has built a nuclear bomb, it likely is going to be\ndifficult for Western nations to slash and burn too far on the defense\nspending. Before running out and loading up on warfare stocks, please remember\n... this is all \u201cIf, Then.\u201d Alliant Techsystems Inc. (NYSE: ATK) trades at\n$56.15 and the 52-week trading range is $51.26 to $78.17. Thomson Reuters has\na consensus price target of $71.70, implying upside of roughly 28%. Alliant\nTech currently has a lower dividend yield against peers with only a payout\nrate of about 1.4% and shares are up about 4% since the Thanksgiving break.\nAlliant is highly dependent on the business of selling bullets and it no\nlonger has the booster-rocket business from Space Shuttle launches. General\nDynamics Corp. (NYSE: GD) trades at $66.15 and the 52-week trading range is\n$53.95 to $78.27. Thomson Reuters has a consensus price target of $76.16,\nimplying upside of about 15%. General Dynamics currently yields about 2.9%.\nL-3 Communications Holdings Inc. (NYSE: LLL) trades at $66.85 and the 52-week\ntrading range is $58.30 to $88.55. Thomson Reuters has a consensus price\ntarget of $71.64, implying upside of only about 7%. L-3 yields about 2.7% in\nits dividend and shares are up about 5% from the Thanksgiving break. Lockheed\nMartin Corp. (NYSE: LMT) trades at $81.25 and the 52-week trading range is\n$66.36 to $82.43. Thomson Reuters has a consensus price target of $80.12,\nimplying that the stock is above a full-value price. Its dividend yield is\nquite high at about 5% and shares are up almost 5% since its $1.00 dividend\nwas reflected in the stock in late November. Raytheon Co. (NYSE: RTN) trades\nat $48.50 and the 52-week trading range is $38.35 to $53.12. Thomson Reuters\nhas a consensus price target of $49.53, implying upside of only about 2%. Its\ndividend yield is currently about 3.7% and shares are up about 14% since the\nThanksgiving break. Unless something new comes out of North Korea, or unless\nthere is more unrest in the Middle East, Iran is the big worry for the country\ntoday. With such high payouts from some defense contractors, it is worth\nwondering just how high some of the payouts can rise during the proliferation\nof austerity. JON C.

The Games are televised\nfor the entertainment of the general population. Collins models her games on\nancient Rome, where gladiators fought to the death and slaves were fed to the\nlions. She even names her dystopian world Panem, after the Latin word for\nbread, as in bread and circuses, panem et circenses. Bread and circuses refers\nto the cheap trick of persuading the masses to cheer for a lion or a slave,\nfor one gladiator or another, rather than participating in or observing or\nacting to change the political arena. Keep the general population fed with the\nmost basic of food and keep their minds off of rebellion with the distractions\nof entertainment. As I read through Lenore Skenazy\u2019s blog and watched her\nappearances on various chat shows, I kept thinking, \u201cBread and circuses.\u201d\nThere is so much air time to fill, so television producers and headline\nwriters make news of the Mommy Wars. Free Range Parenting vs. Helicopter\nParenting. Stay-at-home Mothers vs. Working Mothers. Breast vs. Bottle. Sleep\nTraining vs. Attachment Parenting. Blah, blah, blah. In one blogger\u2019s take on\nthe issue, she asks, \u201cFree range parenting versus helicopter parenting: which\nteam are YOU on?\u201d Really? We have to pick teams? These issues are so much more\ncomplex than x vs. y, but so much easier to digest if packaged in a familiar\nus vs. them format. In one clip, Skenazy and another parent appear on Anderson\nCooper to replay how Skenazy was able to help this woman who is so much of the\nhelicopter persuasion that in public washrooms she feels it necessary to go\nright into the bathroom stall with her daughter. \u201cDoesn\u2019t everybody?\u201d this\nmother quips, when the audience gasps. They feed this woman to the lions, then\nthey rescue her, undo her public shame with a public reformation of her\nextreme and errant ways. Unless it\u2019s extreme, it\u2019s not entertainment, so we\nhave thown up on the screen all kind of wild and wacky folk on reality shows\nwho hoard or dumpster dive for coupons for hundreds of free sticks of\ndeodorant, saving up against Armageddon. What good does any of this do? Silly\ndistractions from the reality lived in the murky middle ground. I respect\nSkenazy and her husband\u2019s decision to let their son ride the subway alone. I\nrespect her desire to move away from a culture where kids are kept bubble\nwrapped. I respect her initiative to create a television show that capitalizes\non the buzz that her son\u2019s subway ride generated. But I resent the circus\natmosphere of telling the stories of bubble wrapped or free range kids. Why do\nmothers keep feeding each other to the lion of artificially polarized public\nopinion?| <urn:uuid:1ac6d51e-62f3-46ac-b505-0adc65876218>| CC-MAIN-2013-20|\nhttp://4mothers1blog.com/2012/04/24/a-big-silly-distraction/|\n2013-05-18T06:19:05Z| s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-\nMAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-\nMAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz| en| 0.937658|\n620  \nI tend to specialise in shallow depth of field commercial and editorial\nimages, recently I have been involved in portraiture and fashion as the\ntechnical challenges have been interesting to me.

The Stephen Breen Memorial Foundation brought together Fort Worth's\nCatholic kids of all ages for the fifth annual SPIRIT GAMES, a day of\ncompetition and fun. The Stephen Breen Memorial Foundation is committed to\noffering financial aid to local children who seek the strength and values of a\nCatholic education and to those courageous children and their families whose\nlives are afflicted with cancer. The 5Choir played and sang for the Mass with\nBishop Kevin Vann, and played a short set of songs after Mass. The band\ncovered songs featured on local Christian station KLTY, such as \"Your Grace is\nEnough\" and \"The Revelation Song\" as well as Catholic favorites like \"Here I\nAm, Lord\". For the Ordinary of the Mass, they played selections from the new\nMass of St. Frances Cabrini by Kevin Keil, director of Liturgy and Music at\nHoly Cross Catholic Church in The Colony. The members of the 5Choir are: Jed\nChatterton, Mike Hyry & John Costlow, guitars; Gerard Bowsher, drums; Brian\nBenison, bass, keyboards and director; Athena Meyer, flute, keyboard & vocals\nand David Lyles, Victor Meyer, Honey Rae, Aimee Pietzsch, Peggy Spears, Mark\nTrance & Kimberly Ward, vocals.

Asked\nabout the 2012 Spirit Games, 5Choir director Brian said, \"I was thrilled when\nJim Breen, President of The [Stephen Breen Memorial] Foundation called and\nasked if the 5Choir could play at the Spirit Games. Jim heard us play at the\n5PM Mass at Saint Andrew and thought we were a good fit.

I first heard about Bank of America doing this\nyesterday, but now I\u2019m learning that other banks like Chase and Wells Fargo\nmay be doing it as well. Not that I\u2019m surprised. A lot of national chain banks\nare starting to have fees for just about everything else you do. Here\u2019s what\nthe New York Times said on this: Bank of America joins banks including\nSunTrust and Regions in charging the fees. Other institutions, like Wells\nFargo and Chase, are testing them, too. And over all, bank fees have crept up\nto record levels, a recent survey found.

Which is why it was so surprising when the Canadian man received a\nletter addressed \u201cTo the Estate of George Johannesen.\u201d Even more surprising is\nthat it came from his insurance company, who should really be on top of such\nthings. Now this wouldn\u2019t have been so terrible if Manitoba Public Insurance\nwas giving Johannesen\u2019s estate a fat check for his passing away. But that\u2019s\nnot what happened. Instead the letter was to inform the estate that, since\nGeorge was dead, his driver license and auto insurance had been cancelled in\nOctober. This poses a problem for Johannesen because, being alive, he\ncontinues to drive his car. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how this could have happened,\u201d\nhe told the Toronto Sun. \u201cFor me to be declared dead, someone would have to\npresent a death certificate. For someone to get that, I guess I must have died\nsometime in October.\u201d Now the 59-year-old worries that he will stop getting\nhis pension and other government benefits. The Manitoba Public Insurance\nCompany says they are trying to resolve the issue. They also claim they\nweren\u2019t the ones who determined Johannesen was dead, but cryptically can\u2019t\nreveal the source of the confusion for confidentially reasons.

Scary Tales of Tiny\nGambia Being the Headquarters of the Mafia World By Bubacarr Ceesay December\n13, 2005 The Gambia is the international limelight again as the center of an\ninternational mafia ring. In a masterpiece investigative report, The Wayne\nMadsen Report unraveled a network of weapons smugglers and mobsters operating\nin the heart of the Gambian Capital, working hand in hand with the Gambian\nleader, President Yahya Jammeh. In reference to the Gambia, the report stated\nthus: \"There is also now interest in the activities of Richard T. Hines, the\nhead of the powerful Republican lobbying firm RTH Consulting, Inc. \"Hines, a\nSouth Carolina native and a protege of the late GOP dirty trickmeister Lee\nAtwater, was one of the architects of the dirty tricks campaign by Bush\nagainst John McCain in the 2000 South Carolina primary. \"A confederate of\nAbramoff in the 1980s Reagan administration's covert support network for the\nNicaraguan contras, Angolan UNITA guerrillas, and Afghan mujaheddin, Hines is\nactive in various Confederacy resurgence organizations, many of which have\nclear racist agendas. \"However, that has not prevented Hines from becoming the\nlobbyist for Gambian dictator Yahya Jammeh, a military officer who overthrew\nGambia's democratically-elected President Sir Dawda K. Jawara in a 1994\nmilitary coup supported by the United States Navy. \"Hines inherited the\nlobbying contract for Gambia from the eclectic Washington lobbyist Edward von\nKloberg III, an individual who represented Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire,\nLiberia's Samuel K. Doe, Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania, Congolese leader\nLaurent Kabila, the exiled King Kigeli V of Rwanda, and Saddam Hussein. \"Last\nMay, von Kloberg took a swan dive off of a castle in Rome, allegedly\ncommitting suicide after a spat with a gay partner. \"The connections between\nHines and Gambia are important since the small narrow West African country is\nalso a major base of operations for notorious Russian international arms\nsmuggler Viktor Bout. \"The Gambia is the headquarters for one of many of\nBout's front companies -- companies that are used to smuggle everything from\nweapons to diamonds and mercenaries to international relief supplies. Bout,\nreportedly in a Bangkok jail since March 2008 \"In fact, Bout was the character\non whom fictional arms smuggler Yuri Orlov, played by Nicolas Cage in the\nmovie Lord of War, was largely based. \"Bout's connections with the Christian\nRight do not end with Gambia. \"Bout was Liberian dictator Charles Taylor's\nprimary arms and diamond smuggler. \"Bout and his associates were given\nLiberian diplomatic passports and, with Taylor's blessing and protection, they\nregistered a number of their front companies in Monrovia, the Liberian\ncapital. \"Taylor, who is now in exile in Nigeria, was a business partner with\nChristian Coalition founder Pat Robertson. \"Robertson's organization mentored\nboth Ralph Reed and Richard Hines. \"According to British and Israeli\nintelligence sources, Taylor also enabled Al Qaeda to launder blood diamonds\nfor cash through Liberia. \"Liberia and neighboring Sierra Leone were where\nIsraeli mobsters engaged in business with Israeli gangsters who operated under\nthe full protection of the Israeli Likud government. \"Before Likud began\npurging Mossad of experienced intelligence officers with ties to the Israeli\nLabor Party, the Israeli-Al Qaeda diamond financial connection in West Africa\nwas being pointed out by those officers as suicidal for Israeli interests.\n\"However, Taylor and Bout had powerful interests in the United States: a\ncombination of the Christian Right and pro-Likud organizations like the\nAmerican Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), both of which ignored and\ncontinue to ignore Israeli organized crime connections to Al Qaeda and\nterrorism. \"Robertson and Taylor were business partners in a Cayman Islands\nfront company called Freedom Gold, Ltd. \"In fact, Freedom Gold bas\nheadquartered at Robertson's CBN offices in Virginia Beach, Virginia.\nRobertson's African interests also crossed paths with Bout's in another\ncountry -- the former Zaire. \"Robertson's African Development Company used the\ncover of Robertson's tax-exempt \"Operation Blessing\" to ferry conflict\ndiamonds out of civil war-ravaged Zaire (now Congo). \"A UN Security Council\nreport dated November 30, 2005, lists Bout's Gambia New Millennium Air Company\nas having its address at the residence of Hines' client Jammeh: State House,\nBanjul, Gambia. \"The UN report states, 'The Director of this firm is Baba\nJobe, who is already listed on the Liberia Sanctions Committee's assets freeze\nlist. According to a commercial aviation database, the firm acted as a cover\nfor Victor Bout's operations. Its one aircraft, a Russian-made passenger jet,\nwas acquired from Centrafrican Airlines.' \"It is noteworthy that Hines's\nclient, President Jammeh, just took possession of the Russian-made VIP\npresidential passenger jet, an Ilyushin IL-62 (C5-GNM) [Gambia] (formerly\nCCCP-86511 [USSR], RA-86511 [Russia], 3D-RTI [Swaziland], TL-ACL [Central\nAfrican Republic]). \"And also of interest is the owner of the presidential\naircraft: it is none other than Gambia New Millennium Air, the Bout-owned\ncompany listed on the UN Security Council freeze list and which is\nheadquartered at Jammeh's State House in Banjul, the Gambian capital. \"In\nfact, the plane had been previously registered to Bout front companies in\nSwaziland and the Central African Republic. \" Bout, who flew arms and\npassengers from Dubai and other locations to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan\nprior to 9-11, is now providing air services in post-Taliban Afghanistan as\nwell as U.S.-occupied Iraq. \"Bout's transactions with the Taliban were handled\nby Vial, Inc., a firm based in Delaware. \"One of Bout's closest associates is\nthe Russian-Israeli Odessa-born crime boss Leonid Minin, an Israeli national\nwho, according to the UN Security Council, travels on forged German passports\nas well as legal Israeli, Russian, Greek, and Bolivian passports under at\nleast ten aliases. \"It is also noteworthy that many of Bout's operations are\nbased in Eastern European countries that have been mentioned in association\nwith the rendition and transporting of CIA prisoners. \"Bout's numerous\nRussian-built cargo and passenger planes have been seen at the same airports\nused by CIA flights. \"For example, Bright Aviation, a suspected Bout front, is\nbased at Sofia Airport in Bulgaria. \"Bulgaria is believed to be one of the\ncountries used by the CIA to house secret prisoners. \"Another Bout front,\nMoldtransavia SRL, is based in Chisinau, Moldova, another suspected stopover\npoint for CIA flights. \"One Chisinau, Moldova-based Bout front company,\nAerocom, which also does business as Air Mero, is contracted to fly for\nKellogg, Brown & Root in Iraq and elsewhere. \"Aerocom has also been cited in\nUN and DEA reports for being involved in drug smuggling in Belize. \"Some law\nenforcement officials in the United States and Europe believe that the covert\nflights being operated by CIA contractors and Bout's companies in support of\nsecret prisoner movement are also involved in smuggling drugs. \"After being\nsubjected to news reports, Aerocom quickly changed its name last year.\" Highly\ndependable sources in Banjul also informed AllGambian about recent arms\npurchase by the Jammeh regime from an undisclosed country, amounting to 4.3\nmillion dalasis. This comes at the heels of a hard-hitting border impasse\nbetween the Gambia and Senegal. The stand-off almost paralyzed the Gambian\neconomy and caused untold hardship on the average Gambian. Observers wondered\nhow the Gambia gov can afford to spend on presidential jets and military\nhardware at this junction when the economy is in shambles.|\n<urn:uuid:052280ae-4e57-401f-95a0-23a58b01b11a>| CC-MAIN-2013-20|\nhttp://aangirfan.blogspot.ca/2008/12/gambia-and-organised-crime.html|\n2013-05-18T07:19:30Z| s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-\nMAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-\nMAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz| en| 0.947875|\n1,848  \nRagdoll Kittens Available Now!

Display\nsession, Tuesday, June 09 Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) explosions can make kpc-size\nshells and holes in the interstellar media (ISM) of spiral galaxies if much of\nthe energy heats the local gas to above 10^7 K. Disk blowout is probably the\nmajor cause for energy loss in this case, but the momentum acquired during the\npressurized expansion phase can be large enough that the bubble still\nsnowplows to a kpc diameter. This differs from the standard model for the\norigin of such shells by multiple supernovae, which may have problems with\nradiative cooling, evaporative losses, and disk blow-out. Evidence for giant\nshells with energies of \\sim10^53 ergs are summarized.

And lots of people believe they know how to\nmake their wishes come true with magical thinking. What is it? \"Magical\nthinking is a belief in forms of causation, with no known physical basis,\"\nsaid Professor Emily Pronin of Princeton. \"So, for example, there's no known\nphysical basis for how carrying a fluffy pink rabbit's foot in your pocket is\ngoing to increase your odds of winning the lottery.\" For magical thinkers,\nit's more about the power of their wishes, their feelings and their positive\nthinking to affect their lives directly. Twenty-seven-year-old aspiring\nactress Lindsay Lioz relies on magical thinking to further her showbiz career\n-- starting with visualizing every audition in advance. \"It makes me feel like\nI've had rehearsal,\" she said. \"It makes me feel prepared.\" Lioz also uses\nmagical thinking to improve her love life. She's written a list of the\nqualities she wants in a man -- and she sleeps with that list under her pillow\nevery night. How has it worked so far? \"I have great men in my life, I do. I'm\nvery happy with how it's working out.\" Magical thinkers call that idea \"the\nlaw of attraction.\" It's a key element of the bestselling book \"The Secret,\"\nwhich has been hailed by Oprah Winfrey and bought by millions worldwide. \"'The\nSecret' is telling people that if you think positive thoughts, positive things\nwill happen, even at a very specific level,\" Pronin said. \"If you visualize\ngetting a parking space, you will get one. If you want to get thin, just stop\nhaving fat thoughts.\" Magical thinking is not a religion. It's a different\nkind of faith -- a faith in the power of positive thoughts and feelings. Yet\nas unscientific as magical thinking sounds, Pronin said studies have shown\nthere are times when it seems to have a real effect: \"There was a study where\npeople in their mid-20s were measured in terms of their optimism,\" she said,\n\"and then, 50 years later, those who were more optimistic, were actually more\nlikely to still be alive. So it's not always magical to believe that your\npositive thoughts are having a positive effect.\" Magical thinking starts in\nchildhood. At the University of Texas, Professor Jacqui Woolley has examined\nhow children who know the difference between what's real and what's not\nbelieve that wishing can cause a penny to appear in what has just been shown\nto be an empty box. \"We find that, by about the age of 4, most of the kids we\ntest seem to really believe that wishing works,\" said Woolley. \"So that would\nbe an example of magical thinking.\" Nick Barber spent his childhood wishing\nfor riches, focusing on something his father gave him. \"I was about 8 or 9\nwhen my dad came home and gave me a fake million dollar bill,\" he said. \"And\nthat became something that represented my goals. I've hung on to it every\nsince.\" Barber would even sleep with the bill under his mattress. Now, at 27,\nhe runs a multimillion dollar real estate company in Dallas called UMoveFree,\nand he still has that million dollar bill in his wallet. How did that bill\nhelp him get to this point? \"It allowed me to believe in myself at a very\nyoung age,\" Barber said, \"not to pay attention to those that said you can't,\nand to always believe that I can.\"|\n<urn:uuid:97684525-19c7-48da-a302-c2da701993dd>| CC-MAIN-2013-20|\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=3160862&page=1| 2013-05-18T07:15:02Z|\ns3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-\nMAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz| en| 0.990037|\n716  \nDo you drive a picop? Eat s\u00e1ndwiches de rosbif? Do you still own any\ncederrones? If these words don't sound familiar to you, that's because\nyesterday, the Associated Press released their first-ever Spanish language\nstyle guide, and set us all straight on the proper usage of some of Espa\u00f1ol's\nnewest words. In case there's any confusion, picop is AP's official Spanish-\nlanguage word for what many call a camioneta or pick-up truck, rosbif is their\nofficial spelling for \"roast beef\" in Spanish. And cederr\u00f3n? That means CD-\nROM. Duh. Gathered in the auditorium of the prestigious Columbia Journalism\nSchool, some of the leading Spanish-language journalists sat down on Monday\nevening to discuss the finer points of the \"language of Cervantes\" and the AP\nstylebook -- which they describe as the \"journalist's bible.\" Debate over the\nAP's continued use of term \"illegal immigrant\" dominated much of the event.\nBut the most lively part of the evening was the presentation of words with\nroots in modern-day English -- or \"estadunidismos,\" as the new Stylebook calls\nthem. If the Spanish-language style guide is to be our bible, then Monday\nevening's Moses was surely Argentine journalist Jorge Ignacio Covarrubias who\nhas worked with the AP for more than 40 years and helped put together the new\nstylebook. The white-haired Covarrubias handed down to us such words as zapeo\nfor channel surfing, cibersitio for website, piperm\u00edn for peppermint,\nofim\u00e1tica for computer system for office management (like Word), and verm\u00fa for\nvermouth -- all in the form of a PowerPoint presentation. (Can we please call\nit a Powerrpo\u00edn?) But not all Spanglish words are fair game, according to\nCovarrubias. For example, the AP recommends against using parada to mean\nparade. The word \"parada\" has historically been used to mean \"stop\", but many\nmodern-day Spanish speakers have started using it to also mean parade. The AP\nsuggests that writers instead use \"desfile.\" Many regionalisms are also\ndiscouraged. Autob\u00fas is the preferred term for bus, although some countries\nuse guagua and others say colectivo. But, after lengthy discussion of the\nSpanish word for \"drinking straw,\" (pajita vs. popote vs. canuto), no\nconsensus has yet been reached, said Covarrubias. Not everybody was happy\nabout all of the AP's decisions. Laura Mart\u00ednez, a bilingual blogger who\nwrites about Hispanic media, tweeted \"Cervantes is probably revolc\u00e1ndose en la\ntumba tras escuchar el tema \u00e9se del \"cederr\u00f3n\",\" which translates to\n\"Cervantes is probably turning over in his grave after hearing the thing about\nthe 'cederr\u00f3n'\"| <urn:uuid:cd3169e8-c0b9-4e0a-9e29-ee6c8330ed11>| CC-\nMAIN-2013-20| http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/ap-spanish-language-\nstylebook-introduces-technical-spanglish/story?id=17769035|\n2013-05-18T06:21:24Z| s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-\nMAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-\nMAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz| en| 0.921005|\n619  \nThe recent news that Bristol Palin and Levi Johnston were engaged came as a\nshock to many. After all, here's a couple whose relationship imploded on the\nworld stage and turned into a bitter family feud involving Palin's mother\nSarah Palin, the former vice presidential candidate. Following their breakup,\nthe pair traveled very different paths: Bristol Palin went on to be a\nspokeswoman for teen abstinence; Levi Johnston posed for Playgirl. But like\nstar-crossed lovers, Palin and Johnston found a way to come back together,\nreuniting for the sake of their year-old son, Tripp. \"It's like Romeo and\nJuliet in Wasilla,\" Joy Behar said on \"The View.\" And while their relationship\nmay seem rife with reality TV-like drama, according to Thomas Van Flein, the\nPalin family attorney, there's no plan for the young mom to chroncile her\nromance anytime soon. \"There is a lot of public speculation that Bristol and\nLevi have signed up for a reality show about their relationship,\" he said in a\nstatement to ABC News today. \"They have not. While several networks have\npitched different concepts, Bristol has not agreed to participate in any show.\nHer focus remains on doing what is best for Tripp and her family.\" Though they\nannounced their engagement last week on the cover of US Weekly, senior editor\nLindsay Powers said the news shouldn't come as a total surprise. \"About a\nmonth ago we saw the relationship thawing between them,\" Powers told\nABCNews.com. That's when Palin told \"Good Morning America\" that she was\ngetting back together with Johnston for Tripp's sake. \"I am doing my best to\nraise a happy, active and healthy boy,\" Palin said. \"I believe that wherever\npossible, if the parents can cooperate and co-parent in a positive way, the\nchild will benefit. Levi and I are turning a new page here as co-parents to\nthis wonderful boy and putting aside the past because doing so is in Tripp's\nbest interest.\" They certainly wouldn't be the first couple to reunite for the\nkids and they certainly won't be the last. But will other celebrity couples\nwho have split up follow in their footsteps? Last week, several former couples\nmade headlines.

Even with the shocking news, the Hayes said they never\nconsidered selective reduction, a practice used to reduce the number of\nimplanted embryos. \"You tell me right now, who you wouldn't want to be here?\nPick one, pick two, pick three, tell me.

Each day in the Hayes household means six loads of\nlaundry, four runs of the dish washer and two full gallons of milk. But the\nbiggest number is 120. That's the decibel level of six crying babies, and it's\nlouder than a subway, an ambulance siren or a chainsaw. \"When they were\ninfants all six of them would be crying and I would just stand there and I'd\nstart to laugh because there's really nothing you can do outside of, you know,\ncrying,\" Elizabeth said.

The latest was a 72-year-old man who hanged himself at a\nconstruction site in Hoengseong, Kangwon Province, Thursday, police said. Four\nwomen and one man -- in their 20s and 30s -- were found dead Wednesday in\nHwaseong, just south of Seoul, after sealing a passenger car with plastics\nsheets and inhaling toxic fumes from burned coal briquettes. They left suicide\nnotes saying, \"I have no more hope and no more dreams\" and \"please find my\nidentification card in my back pocket.\" Police were investigating their motive\nbut assumed that the man recruited the four women on the Internet to\nparticipate in a group suicide. Earlier in another city east of Seoul,\nChuncheon, three men in their 20s were also found dead at a private room-for-\nrent lodge using the same method and sealing the door and windows with dark\nmasking tape from inside the room they were sharing. Police assumed that they,\ntoo, were driven by group suicide pacts cultivated online. Such news is common\nhere where the suicide rate is the highest among members of the Organization\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development group of developed countries. An\naverage of 35.1 people killed themselves everyday in 2008, according to the\nhealth ministry. That's 24.3 for every 100,000 South Koreans, followed by 21\nin Hungary, 19.4 in Japan, 16.7 in Finland and 15.8 in Belgium. The National\nStatistics Office reported that the suicides are related to the economic\ndownturn, as well as rapid social change within the family and the community.\nKorean society in recent years has been plagued by continuous cases of suicide\namong celebrities, high-profile politicians and businessmen, teenagers and the\nelderly. Analysts say the most common cause is depression stemming from social\nand academic pressures or family troubles. \"There's a huge gap in this country\nbecause the speed of materialism spreading is much faster than the speed of\ncultural maturity that must grow together. It all comes from stress of rapid\nmodernization,\" said Jeung Taek-Hee, an expert and consultant at Lifeline\nKorea. Korean parents are having fewer children -- on average one per couple\n-- and more women are going into the workforce, which leaves the child alone.\nAlthough some corporations and government ministries are campaigning for\nworkers to go home by 6 o'clock at least once a month to spend family time,\nKorean corporate culture still requires employees to participate in work-\nrelated dinners and stay late hours. \"Naturally, these busy parents end up\nspoiling the child who ends up self-centered and incapable of dealing with\ncompetition,\" Jeung said. \"But the reality is that this society is very, very\ncompetitive.\" Along with the miraculous rate of economic growth in the past\ndecades, many South Koreans have become driven by materialism that has been\npassed on to their kids, Jeung said. He noted that most of the people who\ncommit suicide, especially the young teenagers, find themselves dangerously\ndistressed by not being able to keep up with others materialistically and\neventually become anti-social. \"The easiest place where they can meet friends\nwho share the same pain is online through suicide communities or chat sites,\"\nJeung said. Once they find each other, they become, \"eternal comrades\" who\n\"must accompany each other to death,\" he said. According to the Ministry of\nEducation, Science and Technology, 28.4 percent of young teenagers committed\nsuicide in 2008 because of \"disturbed family relations,\" mostly the result of\nparental divorce, 19.6 percent from pessimistic depression and 10.1 percent\nfrom academic pressure.| <urn:uuid:2edc9224-49dc-4ff8-a3a7-e5c117b470e6>| CC-\nMAIN-2013-20| http://abcnews.go.com/International/south-korea-struck-online-\nsuicide-pacts/story?id=10636608| 2013-05-18T06:20:24Z| s3://commoncrawl/crawl-\ndata/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-\nMAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz| en| 0.973295|\n750  \nWorld leaders from 47 nations convene this week in Washington, D.C., for the\nNuclear Security Summit, a gathering that the Obama administration hopes will\nraise awareness about the threats of nuclear arms getting into the hands of\nterrorists or \"rogue\" nations. President Obama said Sunday the goal of the\nnuclear summit is to discuss the terrorist threat and getting countries to\nlock down their nuclear weapons in a specific time frame. The Obama\nadministration itself has pledged to try to \"secure all vulnerable materials\"\nwithin four years and is hoping the summit will spark a case for preventive\naction among others. \"If there was ever a detonation in New York City or\nLondon or Johannesburg, the ramifications economically, politically, and from\na security perspective would be devastating,\" Obama said on the eve of the\nsummit. \"And we know that organizations like al Qaeda are in the process of\ntrying to secure a nuclear weapon -- a weapon of mass destruction that they\nhave no compunction of using.\" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said last\nweek that the nuclear summit would be the largest of its kind hosted by a U.S.\npresident since the U.N. conference in 1945. But even as Obama brings the\nissue of nuclear security and disarmament into the spotlight -- first with the\nrelease of the new U.S. nuclear policy, and then the U.S.-Russia arms\nreduction agreement -- he faces significant challenges from two fronts.\nInternationally, U.S. allies such as India, Pakistan and Israel have been\nresistant to signing the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, citing national\nsecurity concerns. The view in many countries is that this week's treaty\nsigning aside, if the United States and Russia -- which together account for\n95 percent of the world's nuclear arsenal and material -- cannot cut their\nnuclear stockpile, why should they be forced to? \"No one is willing to step up\nand say, 'Yea, I'm part of the problem here,\" said former national security\nofficial Ivan Oelrich, now vice president of the Strategic Security Program at\nthe Federation of American Scientists. The \"U.S. and Russia have to lead the\nway in major reductions.\" Participant countries will also likely be looking to\nthe United States for accountability. Henry Sokolsi, executive director of the\nNonproliferation Policy Education Center, argues that if the United States is\ngoing to try to persuade other countries, it needs to shift its own policy at\nhome too. \"I just think it's disrespectful to these countries,\" he said. \"Each\ncountry has its own problems.

Those are the words to describe me right now. Six days\nafter boarding the \"Good Morning America\" Whistle-Stop '08 Tour train, and\nbeginning the adventure of a lifetime, it's over. We just wrapped the last\nshow of our little Odyssey from the Newseum in the nation's capitol,\nWashington D.C., and for me, it was an appropriate but bittersweet ending to\nour tale. Appropriate because the point of our tour was to go out and ask real\npeople what was on their minds, to hear straight from them their concerns\nabout our nation. By ending in Washington, D.C., we brought their thoughts,\nproblems and hopes to the doorstep of the government -- to the people that can\ndo something about them. But it was also bittersweet because I honestly didn't\nwant the trip to end. I'm not going to lie to you and say that I loved\neverything about it (3:00 AM wake up calls being the main offender), but I was\nconsistently surprised to find that even in the tougher times, when we had\nbeen blearily working for 18 hours straight, something or someone would come\nalong to pick everyone up. From the absolute chaos of pre-show preparations,\nto the fleeting sparkle of pride in the production team's eyes when a show\nwent just as planned, life on the train was crazy, grueling and complicated,\nbut most of all, fun. Some moments I'll never forget. Like the celebration in\nMassachusetts after we pulled off what had never been done before -- the first\nlive network television broadcast from a moving train. Or when Diane, Robin\nand Chris teamed up -- using Rick Klein and me as props -- to convince Sam\nthat he was supposed to share his tiny room on the train with two roomates. Or\nwhen Chris put his life on a very secure line at Niagara Falls to dramatically\nbring the news from the brink of watery doom. Or, my personal favorite moment,\nwhen Sam, Chris and two producers played the most ridiculous game of Monopoly\nI've ever seen for four hours and a few of us, Sam included, cried from\nlaughing so hard. But far more moving than the obvious and endearing\ncamaraderie between the anchors was their care for the American people to whom\nthey bring the news every morning. Never was this more obvious than yesterday,\nwhen I accidentally stumbled into an anchors' meeting where they discuss the\ncontent of the next day's show and, for some reason, I was allowed to stay. As\nan aspiring journalist myself, I can't express how inspiring it was to listen\nin on this discussion and know firsthand that whatever goes on the air, it's\nthe fairest, most accurate and most informative report possible. Though they\nhave their fun, when it comes to the news Diane, Robin, Chris and Sam are\nprofessionals in every sense of the word. But now I have to go -- have to\nreturn to \"normal\" life, and I don't want to. I have to shave my rail-beard,\nthe result of a production-wide pact to not shave for the duration of the\ntrip. I have to wash some extremely smelly clothes. I also have a feeling that\nthe spontaneous dance parties that erupted on the train will be for some\nreason looked down upon in the office. These are all reasons to miss dragging\nmyself aboard that cramped studio on rails well before the sun comes up. But\nmaybe we'll be able to do it again sometime. We were told to get back to New\nYork however we wanted. I think I'll take a train.|\n<urn:uuid:f00df4e1-9a25-4e7e-bd1e-0bba13621b1e>| CC-MAIN-2013-20|\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/politics/5050/story?id=5840462&category=Good%20Morning%20America|\n2013-05-18T06:44:58Z| s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-\nMAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-\nMAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz| en| 0.977122|\n739  \nAlready have an account?

Rx helps do to really wonderful things with asynchronous and\nparallel programming in unreliable distributed world. Do you remember what\nLINQ did to the collections (and much more)? Well, Rx is going to do (and\ndoing) the same to events, asynchronous and distributed programming. So if you\nhave to deal anything that requires more than a single thread, process or\nmachine to run - you'll be impacted in some way or the other. The thing I love\nthe most about what Eric Meijer and his team are doing - the underlying logic\nwhich is simple plain and so beautiful. Even the entire IObservable/IObserver\nthing could be logically derived from IEnumerable by inverting the concepts\nlogically. Just watch these videos, if you are interested in the details here\n(highly recommended): What does this have to do with CQRS, Domain-Driven\nDesign and Event Sourcing? When I'm building some complex interactions and\nsystems, I'm trying to follow the same principle. System design and evolution\nare not guided by the intuition or creativity. Pure logic and mathematical\nreason are the most reliable advisors here (it feels like proving a theorem).\nIt's really hard to explain in words, but logically solid design can handle a\nlot of things with really little effort (and code) just because of it's\nnature. Basically it allows to say to new challenges: \"we did not code for\nthis, but since this is logical, it already is in the design, you just need to\nenable this\". While I'm just learning CQRS/DDD/ES I want to do it in the\nlogical way that will prevent me from doing bad and illogical things (which\nwill impact my systems later in their lifecycle). Way of thinking that Eric\nMeijer shows, seems to help here. Besides, it helps to merge the ideas of Pat\nHelland (almost infinitely scalable systems) into the overall CQRS concepts.\nReactive Extensions benefit a lot from the marble diagrams representing\nparallel processes and their interactions. So I've tried to re-apply these\nprinciples to my understanding of CQRS/DDD/ES. By mechanically reflecting the\nlogic, here's what I've got for the command handler: Essentially this picture\nreflects the flow of commands (marked with D for Do) incoming into the\nhandler. Commands can come as a single or as a batch (that's the marble or\ntick in this reality). Commands coming together either succeed or fail\ntogether. Each incoming tick translates into a new parallel reality for an\naggregate (just like SelectMany in Rx, where you get observable of observable\nof T). Then we flatten successful commands onto the change stream (each change\nis a unit of work), while errors are flattened into the failure stream. There\nis a message dispatcher that catches up upon these streams and sends domain\nevents, command failures and confirmations back to the message bus. This way\nsubscribers will have logically complete information about what's happened in\nthe business logic. Subscribers could include sagas and event handlers working\nwith read models (which will be used to provide clients with feedback that\nincludes potential command failures). Note a few differences upon the\ntraditional CQRS with event sourcing approach as advocated by Greg Young: -\nAggregate Root can react to incoming commands by providing a finite stream of\nevents, optionally terminating with error (there is a direct translation from\nRx observers here: OnError and OnComplete). - We save successful change\n(command(s) and resulting events) atomically as unit of work. Persisting\ncommands will actually let us ensure command idempotency in the cruel world of\nscalable message queues (with \"at least once\" deliveries). Essentially this is\nreflection of Helland's activities that we need to have in the same scope with\nthe aggregates that own them. - Command failures are also saved (although the\nstream could be different from the event source). We don't need to save the\nintermediate events though - just command(s) and the resulting failure. -\nMessage dispatcher runs upon the failure and change streams, publishing domain\nevents into the message bus. We have logically complete information here, that\ncould eventually be provided for the client (sender) for the retrieval. -\ntheoretically we can easily process commands for a single aggregate in\nmultiple threads, serializing access to the change and failure streams. Things\nthat do not fit in, yet: - In CQRS practice there are cases, when there would\ntraditionally be a call to the domain service (in the command handler and\nbefore the aggregate root). This does not fit in here. In a Rx world this\nwould probably be a separate async command handler. Yet this would require an\nadditional layer of translation (another command handler and event handler). -\nevents and commands are some sort of duals. They are both messages that bring\nalong different intent and help to organize CQRS architecture (this comes from\nthe DDD realm). Yet, this duality (and the rules coming out of it) brings\nadditional complexity, when you need to chain multiple operations (first call\nunreliable operation, then pass the result to the aggregate, then do something\nelse). I think I'm missing some aspect of commands and events that would help\nto lay out interactions in a clean and logical way. That's a theory and logic\nas I see them today. This means: - tomorrow perception might evolve into\nsomething different that better brings together known patterns and\nconstraints. - in theory there is no difference between theory and practice.\nIn practice - there is a difference. If I could bring in sagas, view event\nhandlers and domain services into the picture in a logical way (and without\nbreaking any existing scalability and consistency constraints), I'd be a happy\nman. We'll see how it goes (see xLim 4: CQRS in Cloud series for any latest\nmaterials on this topic). Meanwhile I'm really interested in your thoughts on\nthis subject.| <urn:uuid:aae437a0-dcca-4c82-a512-d261b6cf812d>| CC-\nMAIN-2013-20| http://abdullin.com/journal/2010/9/19/domain-driven-design-\nevent-sourcing-rx-and-marble-diagrams.html| 2013-05-18T05:53:46Z|\ns3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-\nMAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz| en| 0.94712|\n1,240  \nIf Superman had explored these issues instead of bashing unions and promoting\ncharters, moviegoers might have walked away understanding a great deal about\nwhy the families it profiled and so many similar families across America face\na bleak educational future.

The\nconsultation and resultant changes largely arose following the outcry after\nKraft\u2019s takeover of Cadbury and particularly the subsequent closure of\nCadbury\u2019s Somerdale factory near Bristol, despite pledges in the offer\ndocument to keep the plant open. Originally, the consultation considered far-\nreaching ideas such as giving different voting rights to long-term and short-\nterm shareholders and increasing the level of ownership required to control a\ncompany beyond the traditional 50 percent level. Although a number of the more\nradical possibilities were rejected by the Code Committee earlier in the year,\nthe proposed changes, which were initially unveiled in March 20111 and have\nnow been published in final form,2 make a number of changes to the City Code\nwhich will affect the way in which takeover offers are effected. The changes\nare effective from 19 September 2011. As expected, and despite some last\nminute lobbying, the final amendments largely reflect the Code Committee\u2019s\nprevious conclusions and the draft proposals published earlier this year. The\nmain themes of the changes are: - Shifting the balance of power from offerors\nto target companies; - Ending break fees, exclusivity and other deal-\nprotection arrangements; - Increasing transparency on advisers\u2019 fees; -\nHolding offerors to account for their statements of intention; and -\nIncreasing employee involvement and information in offer processes. Changes to\nthe Takeover Code \u2014 \u201cVirtual Bid\u201d Periods The default requirement in all\ntakeover situations will be that potential offerors must be publicly named and\nthen have a fixed 28-day period to either make their offer or withdraw from\nthe process entirely. The 28-day period may only be extended on the joint\napplication of the offeror and offeree to the Panel. This switches the onus\naway from the offeree board having to approach the Panel for a \u201cput up or shut\nup\u201d deadline, in the event an offeror is laying siege to a target for a\nprolonged period of time without being identified. This new requirement to\nidentify a potential offeror will only apply when an announcement of a\npotential offer is required, and as a result, potential offerors will be\nfurther encouraged to protect the confidentiality of the process for a longer\nperiod of time. Potential offerors will not, however, be able to restrict (or\nattempt to restrict) the offeree from disclosing their identity where there\nCity Code requires that disclosure. The Panel is expected to be receptive to\nrequests to extend the 28-day period, particularly where good reasons can be\nshown why the process is taking longer. Friendly, recommended offers should\ntherefore be able to proceed on a slightly slower timetable while hostile or\nunwelcome offerors will be forced to move with much more decisiveness. There\nis a limited exception from the proposed identification regime and time limits\nwhere an offeree announces that it is conducting a formal sale process and\nseeking one or more potential offerors. The details of the sale process and\nproposed participants will not then need to be made public. In order to\nqualify for this exemption, the offeree will need to formally put itself up\nfor sale; traditional \u201cstrategic review\u201d announcements, often seen as code for\nputting themselves up for sale, will not be sufficient. \u2014 Deal Protection\nMeasures Deal protection measures will be completely prohibited except in very\nlimited circumstances. The restriction will apply to \u201coffer-related\narrangements,\u201d which are generally defined as \u201cany agreement, arrangement or\ncommitment in connection with an offer\u201d and will apply to currently common\narrangements such as: - Inducement fee and break fee arrangements; -\nImplementation agreements; - Exclusivity arrangements; and - \u201cWork-fee\u201d\narrangements. Inducement fees will still be permitted in exceptional\ncircumstances such as where a \u201cwhite knight\u201d offeror3 makes an offer following\nthe announcement of a hostile offer. The inducement fee will, however, be of\nlimited value as it will only apply if a third competing offeror were to\nmaterialise and succeed, not if the original hostile offeror were to succeed.\nAs anticipated, the City Code itself will now contain specific provisions\nregarding takeovers which are implemented by way of schemes of arrangement to\nensure that offeree companies adhere to any timetable and process agreed with\nthe offeror and included in the offer documentation. \u2014 Disclosure of Fees The\nestimated fees payable by offerors and offerees will need to be disclosed in\noffer documents. These will be broken down by category of adviser, with the\nfee for each of the offeror and offeree and in respect of the offeror\u2019s\nfinancing arrangements being split out separately. The new rules address\ndifferent fee structures, such as success fees, by providing the ability to\ndisclose expected fees and maximum fees so as to protect commercially\nsensitive information, such as the thresholds at which success fees may kick\nin. Where the disclosure subsequently proves inadequate, updated information\nmay need to be publicly announced. \u2014 Increased Disclosure Requirements\nIncreased disclosure about the financing of offers will be required, with\ncopies of the financing documents to be made available on the offeror\u2019s\nwebsite. Certain commercially sensitive information, such as headroom to\nincrease an offer, may be withheld, as may the structure by which equity is\nprovided to private equity offeror vehicles; a general disclosure as to how\nmuch is sourced from each fund will be sufficient. Separately, all-cash\nofferors need to disclose additional information, putting them on par with\nofferors offering securities as consideration, though this will not extend to\ninformation such as a pro forma balance sheet reflecting the offer and\nsignificant change statements since their last audited accounts. \u2014 Statements\nas to Future Conduct Following the public and political criticism following\nKraft\u2019s closure of Cadbury\u2019s Somerdale factory, the City Code is being\nstrengthened to try to force more and better disclosure. Offerors will be\nrequired to include enhanced statements of their intentions for the offeree\nbusiness and its employees as well as information about the effect of the\noffer on its own business. They will then be expected to hold to those\nstatements for either any period specified in the statement or, in the absence\nof any statement, at least 12 months following the offer becoming\nunconditional. Offerors will only be released from these statements if there\nhas been a material change in circumstances. In order to counter the risk that\nthe new rule will encourage vague and general statements, the Code Committee\nhas stated that an offeror should disclose as fully as possible its commercial\nrationale for the takeover and that general statements are unlikely to be\nacceptable where an offeror has had an opportunity to undertake full due\ndiligence. \u2014 Employee Involvement Employees and employee representatives will\nhave enhanced rights to comment on the effects on employment of a proposed\noffer and to have their costs in obtaining advice to verify the information\ncontained in their opinion paid for by the offeree company. The Code Committee\nhas stated its view that the costs should be limited to those required to\nverify the statement by reference to existing sources and not to the provision\nof general advice as to the opinion or to the commissioning of new research to\nsubstantiate an opinion. However, it is likely that there will be debates in\nthe future over the extent of the costs which will be covered, particularly in\ntakeover situations which attract employee and trade union opposition. In\naddition, offeree companies will be required to publish the opinion of the\nemployees or employee representatives on their websites (and announce having\ndone so) when the opinion is received too late to be included in the offer\ndocumentation. Under the old rules, there was no provision requiring this\nopinion to be published if it was not received in sufficient time to be\nincluded within the offer documents. \u2014 \u201cVirtual Bid\u201d Periods Where an offeree\nis in an offer period on the implementation date and if it was in talks with\nor had received an approach from an offeror at the beginning of the offer\nperiod, the identity of the potential offeror will need to be announced by 5\np.m. on the implementation date. Separately, any potential offeror identified\nin an announcement made on or before the implementation date must, by not\nlater than 5 p.m. on the 28th day after the implementation date, either: -\nAnnounce a firm intention to make an offer; - Announce it does not intend to\nmake an offer; or - Together with the offeree company, obtain Panel consent to\nan extension of the deadline. \u2014 Deal Protection Measures Inducement fees or\nother offer-related arrangements entered into before the implementation date\nwill not be subject to the new prohibition. \u2014 Offer Documents & Offeree Board\nCirculars Where the offeror publishes the initial offer document before the\nimplementation date, all subsequent offer-related documents must comply with\nthe City Code\u2019s provisions as they were before the implementation date,\nirrespective of when those documents are published. \u2014 Employee Involvement\nOfferee companies will be required to publish employee representatives\u2019\nopinions on a website and announce having done so with effect from the\nimplementation date, even if the offer document to which the employee\nrepresentatives\u2019 opinion relates was published before the implementation date.\nDespite the extensive nature of these changes, the Code Committee has already\nflagged future areas of amendment, such as imposing an ongoing obligation to\nupdate material information as it changes, and not only when the next offer-\nrelated document is published.

Starr, Gregory*,1, Powell, Thomas1, Martin,\nTimothy1, Gholz, Henry1,2, 1 School of Forestry Resources and Conservation,\nGainesville, FL2 National Science Foundation, Arlington, VA ABSTRACT- Of the\n5.93 million ha of timberland within the state of Florida, only 19% are\nmaintained under conditions classified as \"natural\" pine forest. While\nconsiderable attention has been focused on the carbon and water dynamics of\nmanaged pine plantations in the region, little attention has been given to\nthese natural forests, which are an integral part of the complex mosaic of\nlands in the region. Based on this importance, it was our intention to\nquantify how environmental conditions affect ecosystem carbon, water, and\nenergy exchange within a mature pine flatwoods forest and determine how\nspecific components of the system, (i.e. leaf physiology, soil respiration,\nunderstory composition and canopy structure), contribute to these exchange\nrates. During the 2000-2001 field season, the natural pine flatwoods was a\ncarbon sink with an annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of 183 g C m-2. The\nlargest portion of this carbon was sequestered during the winter and spring\nwhen temperatures were cooler and canopy LAI was lowest. This could be\nattributed to a reduction in ecosystem respiration losses and a slight\nincrease in understory photosynthetic rates caused by a larger portion of\ntotal radiation reaching the understory. Approximately 90% of the respiratory\nlosses from the system could be accounted through soil respiration, which is\nhighly correlated to soil water potential (r2=0.77, p<0.001). Comparison of\neddy covariance measurements above and below the pine canopy indicated that\n37% of the ecosystem\u00eds carbon, 51 % of its latent energy, and 56% of its\nsensible heat fluxes could be attributed to the understory. Preliminary\nresults show that two species, Serenoa repens and Ilex glabra, comprise 95% of\nthe understory vascular and both have relatively high leaf nitrogen\nconcentration and photosynthetic capacities (~1.4% nitrogen and Amax ~ 4.0\nmmol m-2 s-1) and account for ~ 90% of the carbon sequestered by the\nunderstory community. These initial assessments provide evidence that natural\npine flatwood forest of Florida may be a small regional carbon sink.

How do you decide on whether the\npatient can be managed as an outpatient or inpatient? To supplement your\nclinical judgment, many clinicians use the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI)\nscore. Have you heard of CURB-65, supported by the British Thoracic Society?\nWhat about SMART-COP, which is meant to help you predict if your patient will\nneed Intensive Respiratory or Vasopressor Support (IRVS)? It's worth a quick\nreview. Feel free to download this card and print on a 4'' x 6'' index card.\nPresentations are traditionally given using Powerpoint.

Embedded is my handout from a recent\ntalk on mobile apps in Medicine. A new CME publication has emerged from the\npublishers of Emergency Medicine Practice and Pediatric Emergency Medicine\nPractice called EM Critical Care. This new publication is specifically geared\ntowards manging critically ill patients in the ED. There will be 6 issues per\nyear with each issue offering 3 AMA PRA Category 1 credits. Although it has\nnot yet been released, it appears to have an impressive editorial board\nincluding Emanuel Rivers, Michael Gibbs, Benjamin Abella and Robert Arntfield.\nOh, and did I not mention Scott Weingart from the EMCrit Blog? If it is\nanything similar to it's predecessors, it is guaranteed to be a hit! In a\nResearch Letter in JAMA, Dr. Chretien et al describe the profile of physicians\nin the Twitter universe, specifically focusing on professionalism. Self\nidentified physician At least 500 followers during May 1-31, 2010 (Whew, I\nonly have 309 followers.) Posted a tweet within last 6 months A total of 260\nphysicians were studied. 6.2% were from Emergency Medicine. 15% (most) were\nfrom Surgery and its subspecialties. 76% were from the United States. Three\nphysicians independently coded the 20 most recent tweets from each account\n(total n= 5,156) for unprofessional content. There were 144 (3%)\nunprofessional tweets from 27 users: 55 (1%) - possible conflict of interest,\nadvocating for non-standard therapies 38 (0.7%) - potentially violation of\npatient privacy 33 (0.6%) - profanity 14 (0.3%) - sexually explicit material 4\n(0.1%) - discriminatory statement 25 of 27 (92%) of users were identifiable\nThe authors conclude that, although rare, there should be more physician\naccountability and guidelines in the age of social media. This is even more\ntrue, since I just discovered that all tweets are archived by the Library of\nCongress! Take a look at your most recent tweets. How would they have\nperformed if you were included in this study? Reference Chretien KC, Azar J,\nKind T. Physicians on Twitter.

Dr. Rob Orman of ERCast\nblog fame emailed me last week about creating a pocket card on Suicide Risk\nStratification. In many community ED's, risk assessment is done by the\nemergency physician. I'm lucky where I work, because we have a 24/7\npsychiatric ED, which consults on suicidal patients in the \"medical ED\". In\nthe end, assessment is primarily based on physician judgment, because there's\nno great clinical decision tool, rules, or scores to assess risk. Rob has\ncreated his own mnemonic to help you ask the right questions in assessing a\nsuicidal patient. This is a sneak peak into a larger article that Rob is\nplanning to unleash on the world on suicide assessment. Based on his review of\nthe literature and own clinical experience, the mnemonic is: TRAAPPED SILO\nSAFE. \"Risk factors\" which increase a patient's risk for committing suicide in\nthe near future. \"Protective factors\"which decrease a patient's risk for\ncommitting suicide in the near future.

Ever since my post about the top medical\napps, I have been inundated with people asking me to review their apps. One\nhas stood out. Medibabble is a real-time medical translation app and is now\navailable for FREE. It was created by two innovative UCSF medical school\ngraduates, Dr. Alex Blau and Dr. Brad Cohn. This app contains an extensive\npreset list of history questions and physical exam commands. When you click on\na sentence, the app will translate and speak the sentence in one of 5\nlanguages (Spanish, Cantonese, Mandarin, Russian, and Haitian Creole). Take a\nfew minutes to download all of the free languages onto your device. It only\ncomes with Spanish pre-installed. There is a FAQ page at www.medibabble.com.\nThe app is only available for the iOS platform currently. Does your Emergency\nDepartment have computerized spectrophotometric catheters to measure\ncontinuous central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) in early goal directed\ntherapy (EGDT) for severe sepsis? That's what was used in the original Rivers'\nEGDT study. I've never even seen one before. Many emergency physicians are\ngetting around not having the specialized equipment issue by obtaining\nintermittent venous blood gas measurements off of a central venous line. But\nwhat if you had a 30 y/o woman with early pyelonephritis/urosepsis who has\nsevere sepsis by definition? She's got 10 peripheral lines (I'm exaggerating,\nof course), a normalized blood pressure with early IV fluids, and appears non-\ntoxic. Her lactate, however, is 9! Do you really need a central line? My gut\nsays no, but the EGDT protocol says yes -- for the purpose of CVP and ScvO2\nmeasurements. Trick of the Trade: Use a less-invasive approach where bedside\nultrasound and serial venous lactate levels replace central venous lines and\nScvO2 measurements, respectively. Last year, JAMA published a landmark study\nshowing that lactate clearance of \u226510% over the first 2 hours is \"not a worse\nmeasurement\" than ScvO2\u226570%. This double-negative statistical speak came about\nbecause it was a non-inferiority study. So how does this affect the original\nRivers protocol? To review, here's the original protocol, which I posted about\nearlier: (click to view larger image) In the less invasive model: Fluid\nresuscitate through peripheral IV access instead of a central line. Follow\nvolume status either with a bedside ultrasound or urine output. Follow venous\nlactate levels at time 0 and 2 hours. If the lactate clearance is \u226510% over\nthese 2 hours, you should follow the algorithm as if the ScvO2\u226570%. That means\nno need for immediate transfusion or vasopressor agents. How do you know when\nyou have adequately volume-resuscitated a patient using bedside ultrasound?\nMeasure the IVC diameter about 1-2 cm from the right atrium junction. If the\nIVC diameter \u22641.5 cm and has \u226550% collapse with inspiration, the patient has a\nvery low CVP. If the IVC diameter is at least 1.5 cm and has minimal collapse\nwith inspiration, the patient is euvolemic. Move to the next step -- assessing\nthe MAP. This doesn't mean that all EGDT patient should have ONLY peripheral\nlines. Persistent hypotension, a non-clearing lactate level, and/or clinical\ntoxicity warrant more invasive monitoring and management. Scott Weingart has\nan in-depth, 21-minute podcast about the JAMA article and noninvasive approach\nto sepsis: Podcast link. Scott also briefly interviews Dr. Alan Jones\n(Carolinas Medical Center), the first author of the study, in the podcast.\nReference Jones AE, et al; Emergency Medicine Shock Research Network\n(EMShockNet) Investigators.

It all started with six\nof us at an informal dinner in Boston about 5 years ago. And now the\norganization has grown so large that it is now for the first time offering\nannual awards to its members. Know an award-worthy educator? Nominate him or\nher! CDEM Clerkship Director of the Year Award This award recognizes an\nEmergency Medicine Clerkship Director that has made significant contributions\nto either a 3rd or 4th year EM rotation. To be eligible for this award, the\nnominee must currently be a Clerkship Director of a mandatory, selective or\nelective rotation and have served in that role for a minimum of 5 years. This\naward is presented at the annual CDEM meeting. CDEM Young Educator of the Year\nAward This award recognizes a medical student educator at the Clinical\nInstructor or Assistant Professor level and less than 10 year from residency\ncompletion who has made significant contributions to teaching and educating\nmedical students. This award is presented at the annual CDEM meeting. CDEM\nDistinguished Educator Award This award recognizes a medical student educator\nat the Associate Professor or Professor level who has made significant\ncontributions to and has demonstrated sustained excellence in teaching and\neducating medical students for 10 or more years. This award is not presented\nannually; rather, it is bestowed on special occasions. CDEM Award for\nInnovation in Medical Education This award recognizes a medical student\neducator at any faculty rank who has made a significant and innovative\ncontribution to undergraduate medical education. This award is presented at\nthe annual CDEM meeting. By learning about our differences, we can learn to\nappreciate and better communicate with those who are different from us. The\nsame falls true for working with residents and faculty from different\n\"generations\", as defined as traditionalists, baby boomers, generation Xers,\nand millennials. This literature review and consensus document is quite\nextensive and even comes in 2 parts in Academic Emergency Medicine. There is a\ngreat summary table of the generational differences in personal, work, and\neducational characteristics, communication styles, and technology. Think of\nfaculty who fit in these age groups. Do they fit their generational\nstereotype? Traditionalists (born 1925-1945) Personal characteristics: Loyal,\nreluctant to change, dedicated, value honor and duty, patriotic Work\ncharacteristics: Value hierarchy, loyal \"company man\", job security Education\ncharacteristics: Process oriented Communication style: Formal Technology: Tend\nnot to understand Baby Boomers(born 1945-1964) Personal characteristics:\nOptimistic, desire for personal gratification, highly competitive Work\ncharacteristics: Workaholic, competitive, consensus builder, mentor Education\ncharacteristics: Learner depends on educator, lecture format, process-oriented\nCommunication style: Diplomatic Technology: Not particularly techno-saavy\nGeneration Xers (born 1964-1980) Personal characteristics: Independent, self-\ndirected, skeptical, resilient, more accepting of diversity, self-reliant Work\ncharacteristics: Value work-life balance, comfortable with change, question\nauthority Education characteristics: Independent learners, problem-solvers,\ndesire to learn on the job, outcome-oriented Communication style: Blunt\nTechnology: Interested and facile Millennials (born 1980-1999) Personal\ncharacteristics: Optimistic, need for praise, collaborative, global outlook\nWork characteristics: Team-oriented, follows rules and likes having structured\ntime, career changes Education characteristics: Team-based learning\nenvironment, turn to Internet for answers, outcome-oriented Communication\nstyle: Polite Technology: Very saavy, technology is a necessity The authors\ngive multiple examples where generational differences come to light but none\nmore so than in mentorship within the academic department. Traditionalists\nview mentorship as a more formal process, where feedback is necessary only to\nprovide criticism or suggestions for improvement. Baby boomers also view\nmentorship as a \"top down\" process. They are ok with infrequent interactions.\nGeneration Xers and Millennialsprefer mentorship as a more \"peer to peer\"\nprocess with more frequent interactions. They value the personal relationships\nand the opportunity to collaborate in creative solutions. Because of their\nstereotypical distrust of authority, however, they may inadvertently sabotage\ntheir relationship with their mentors. Distrust sometimes is misinterpreted as\na general lack of respect. To overcome these differences, mentor-mentee\npairings should take into consideration gender and shared views about goals,\nwork/life balance, and experiences. Early discussions in a mentorship\nrelationship should discuss generational differences and how each envisions\nthe ideal mentor-mentee relationship to be. The pair should agree upon and\nadopt a collaborative, shared communication approach with frequent feedback.\nSo much more in this article... Take a read. Mohr NM, Moreno-Walton L, Mills\nAM, et al.

A 50 year-old woman, who\npresented to the ENT clinic for followup check of a facial fracture, has a\nblood pressure of 210/100. She is asymptomatic and in no pain. She gets\nreferred immediately to the ED for care. Now you see her in your ED. What\nnext? There is a lot of controversy whether you should treat or not treat\nasymptomatic hypertension in the ED. The ACEP Clinical Policy says that there\nis no need to immediately reduce an asymptomatic patient's blood pressure.\nWith \"close followup\", they can be referred to their primary care physician.\nWith so many patients being uninsured or unable to access their primary care\nphysician on short notice, many emergency physicians like myself are slowly\nmoving towards starting antihypertensive medications for them.

Is there another way to covery risk\nfor patients? Trick of the Trade: Convey probabilities with everyday risks.\nThis article uses a risk stratifying tool to convey probabilities that compare\nto everyday risks such as flying, cancer diagnosis, having an MI, etc. Below\nis the calculation tool from the paper. Using this tool, the risk of\ncontacting HIV for this patient would be: 5/ (1000 x 100 x 100) = 1/ 2,000,000\nAccording to the everyday risk table in the article, this is similar to the\nrisk of dying in the next 12 months from lightning. You left her to decide on\nPEP. As the author pointed out, the risks cited are probabilities instead of\nexact measurements. This is an important caveat. I find this helpful to\nprovide context, especially for those who have difficulty deciding on PEP.\nVertesi L.

This study\nexamines the perception of EM trainees of their competence and adverse events\nand how they feel about reporting them. Anonymous web-based survey sent to all\ntrainees from 9 EM programs in Canada outside Quebec. 37.3% trainees\nresponded. 40% trainees felt they had minimal supervision when doing a task\nthat they did not feel safe about. Most 'unsafe' tasks included providing care\novernight, admission decision or procedures. When feeling incompetent, a third\nof trainees will not report this to their staff. Barriers include worry about\nloss of trust, automony or respect. 64% trainees felt responsible for\ncontributing to adverse events. Most relate to procedures - chest tubes,\ncentral lines, paracentesis. Majority, but not all, reported the most serious\nevents to the staff. Barriers include fear of appearing incompetent and\nhumiliation. How would I change my teaching practice Ensure trainees feel\nsafe. Maybe do a dry run of central line insertion/break bad news prior.\nEncourage trainees to voice their discomfort. They are learning, not just\nworking.

In his talk (subtitled \"School Sucks\"), Northwestern University Physics\nProfessor Dr. Tae describes how he would improve math and science education.\nWhile this is directed at college studies, some of the concepts are applicable\nto teaching Emergency Medicine. He shares a lot of great insight, but I wanted\nto focus on one concept in particular: The secret to learning = \"Work your ass\noff until you figure it out.\" Dr. Tae demonstrates this as we watch him make\n57 failed attempts trying to learn a new skateboarding trick before finally\nbeing able to successfully complete it on the 58th. In order to master this\nnew skill, he had to actively struggle with it until he succeeded. He\ncontrasts this with lectures where students \"just sit there\" passively,\nlearning very little. Clinical decision making is a skill, much like\nskateboarding, and our job in teaching this may be to let the students do most\nof the work. We're only there to offer guidance and point them in the right\ndirection when necessary. So how can we challenge our students to struggle and\nfail until they ultimately figure it out? Share your thoughts and ideas in the\ncomments. Thanks! Patients with a hairy chest may require little patches of\nhair to be shaved when applying EKG leads. This allows the leads to stick\nfirmly to the chest. Loose leads will result in either an artifactual signal\nor no signal at all on the EKG machine. How can you obtain an EKG without\nshaving little patches on the patient's chest? Trick of the Trade: Cover EKG\nleads with damp gauze Water maximes the contact surface area between the EKG\nlead and the patient's skin. The water easily conducts the cardiac electrical\nsignal. Generously soak gauze with water. Apply gauze over each EKG lead where\nit contacts hairy skin.

There are loads of people out there who have already\ncovered this base, and they are far more knowledgeable on the subject. For me,\nwhiskey is first and foremost about stories and anecdotes. The tasting of the\nalcohol is simply the fuel that allows the stories to flow more freely (oo..\nhow poetic! I\u2019ll have to remember that bit). But, for the sake of those out\nthere who have never thought about \u201ctasting\u201d whiskey, it\u2019s good to put this\ninformation out there. And since I will be posting various tastings on this\nhere site, it\u2019s a good idea to give you all the process I will be using. First\nand foremost, let\u2019s get one thing out of the way. There\u2019s a huge chasm between\nthe idea of tasting whiskey and the idea of enjoying whiskey. One activity\ndoes not necessarily have to include the other. If you enjoy making cocktails\nout of the various whiskeys available on the market, then have at it. But it\u2019s\nimpossible to get a clear taste of whiskey once you adulterate it with\nbitters, ginger ale, or sour mix. Additionally, tasting a whiskey involves\nmore than simply putting it into your mouth and swallowing. It\u2019s an\nencompassing experience, using the same amount of our senses as we use when\nconsuming any other food or drink. So let\u2019s define tasting as the act of\nlearning the characteristics of the flavor of whiskey through the use of the\nsenses. But which senses? The same ones used for tasting wine and judging food\n\u2013 seeing, smelling, and tasting. The eyes gives us insight into the drink. It\ncan tell us how young it is, or the kind of barrel in which it was aged.\nGenerally speaking, the lighter the whiskey, the younger it will be. Whiskey\nstraight from the still is often white, while there are some whiskeys out\nthere that have been aged so long than they have a deep red to them. Bourbon\ngets it amber red color from the new and freshly charred oak barrels used in\nits aging process. If bourbon did not use new barrels, or if they didn\u2019t char\nthe new barrels they did use, the Kentucky spirit would have a completely\ndifferent color. Finding the nose of the whiskey is even more important than\nthe look of it. Some would say that the aromas of the whiskey is more\nimportant than the taste. From my reading, I\u2019ve found that it\u2019s not uncommon\nfor blenders to base their recipes primarily on aromas. But if you\u2019re not a\nblender, the nose is of secondary importance, behind taste. To release the\naromas of whiskey, a little water may be necessary. The best way to think of\nthis is that a bit of water wakes up the whiskey that has been asleep from\nanywhere from 3 to 25 years. But how much water? According to Michael Jackson,\nyou want to add just enough water dilute to around 30% alcohol by volume.\nRoughly speaking, this translates to a .5 to 1 water to whiskey ratio if your\ndrinking 80 proof whiskey, or a 1 to 1 water to whiskey ratio if you\u2019ve found\nyourself a whiskey that\u2019s 100 proof. This is simply a rule of thumb, and one\nshould expect many exceptions to this, especially in the older whiskeys. A\nquick side note \u2013 ice should be avoided, as well as chilled water, as they\nclose down the aromatics of the whiskey. The water added should lack any\nobvious characteristics of its own. For example, you wouldn\u2019t add mineral\nwater to your whiskey. It is said that the best water to add to the whiskey is\nthe water found at the site where the whiskey was distilled. Since I\u2019ll assume\nthat the vast majority of you out there are not millionaires, and cannot fly\noff to Kentucky or Speyside simply for a drink of whiskey, let\u2019s just stick to\nbland water. So what are you looking for when you smell a whiskey? That I\u2019ll\nleave up to you to decide. From my point of view, there are no wrong answers\nto this question, because tasting is a very personal experience. If you place\nyour snoot in a dram and the aromas remind you of Newark, then by god, that\u2019s\nwhat you experienced. Yes, there is a vocabulary used by professional tasters,\nand usually they are simply variations of more broad terms (woody, fruitful,\nmedicine, smoky, citrus-like). The aromas you find will likely trigger some\nsort of sense memory. The skill of a professional taster is to put a very\nspecific and accurate word to describe their own sense memory. Or to put it\nanother way, an amateur taster may say that a drink smells a bit fruity and a\nbit woody. A good taster will say that a whiskey carries a strong oak smell\nwith an undercurrent of raisins. A great taster will say that the whiskey had\nbeen in two different casks, one that used in bourbon and the more recent one\nused in the making of sherry; additionally, there are hints of currants and\npeaches, as well as a little bit of vanilla. All of these answers are right.\nThe reason the last taster was able to put more words to the aromas was\nbecause they do this activity more often. That\u2019s the end of part 1. Tomorrow,\nI\u2019ll post about whiskey glasses, and what to do once you actually put the\nwhiskey in your mouth. And, as always, feel free to correct any of my mistakes\nby addressing them in the comments of this post.|\n<urn:uuid:574a5d4e-cf33-4332-b205-9d281ca214eb>| CC-MAIN-2013-20|\nhttp://accidentalhedonist.com/how-to-taste-whiskey-pt-1/|\n2013-05-18T06:43:12Z| s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-\nMAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-\nMAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz| en| 0.959722|\n1,182  \nAcem Meditation is easy to learn.

What I offer below is a mix of what I Think, What I know\nand what Appears to be.... Anyone currently attempting to answer these\nquestions with some type of \"Universal Knowledge\" on the subject--is Full of\nBS--BEWARE! Yes, that includes Me. I don't have the Complete answer to these\nquestions--and neither does anyone else. This is a subject that needs to be\nstudied in-depth by someone that has all the resources to carry it out: Lab,\nveterinary knowledge/skills, Acrochordus snakes, What is it: At this point--I\ndon't know, but here is what I believe based on experience, observation and\nresearch: The skin of the Acrochordus javanicus and arafurae is very\nimpermeable. So, that makes it a very protective mechanism against the outside\nworld. It is commonly understood that \"Stress\" causes a reduction in the\nability of the immune system to do its job--in humans and other animals--\nincluding Acrochordus snakes. Stress appears to cause a decline in the immune\nsystem of Acrochordus snakes causing a decline in the effectiveness of the\nskin as a protective barrier against the outside world. This loss of\neffectiveness increases until Secondary Infections set in and ultimately kill\nthe animal. Where does it come from: See the paragraph above and add: Improper\nHusbandry. Yes, it really is that simple. In the Wild, these animals have the\nability to move from Habitat to Habitat--Microenvironment to Microenvironment.\nEven though the White Spot Fungus appears to be a \"Captivity\" Problem--the\nsnakes in the Wild maybe be able to prevent it--not by some \"Magical\nBacteria\", but, rather: by simply selecting Environments/Microenvironments\nthat they are \"Happy\" with--i.e., minimum sustained stress level. In Captivity\n--the snakes don't have that choice. Plain and Simple. Additionally, it\nappears that the more acclimated to captivity that these snakes get--the more\nsecretive and stress prone they become. How do We get rid of it: Proper\nHusbandry--Yes, it really is that simple. Reduction of \"Stress\" will reduce\nthe Progression of the White Spot Fungus. I have seen it myself. Elimination\nof Stress will Halt the progression of White Spot Fungus. Note: I did not say\nanything about chemicals, medications, etc.--just eliminate the Stress and the\nprogression of the White Spot will stop. What is there will remain until the\nnext shed. After the next shed--the animal will be clean and remain that way--\nas long as all of the husbandry parameters are and remain in order. Its just\nthat Simple. A new animal going through the acclimation process may need to\nshed 2, 3 or even 4 times before the White Spot relents completely. However,\nits progress should be visibly reduced with each So, what is \"Proper\nHusbandry\"? Well, that's what this website is about. No, I don't have all the\nanswers right now, but I've come a long way in the last couple of yrs\ndedicated to these snakes. 1) If You are genuinely interested in these snakes\n--then read this website: Every page, every word, look at every picture. This\nwebsite is not setup for those who are just mildly curious at best. Those\nfolks are more then welcome here. But a lot of information is \"Hidden\" within\nthe text for those who are serious about these animals. Nothing is truly\n\"Hidden\", but even this explanation is not sitting on the Front Page for the\n\"Scanners\" to see. 2) Spend the hours necessary researching these animals for\nYourself. Right now, the more people that reach the same conclusions--based\nupon knowledge and experience--the Better. The Online Bibliography at the link\nis a Good place to start. 3) Acidic water (pH~6.0), Low TDSs (~200ppm), Low\nlight--especially in the hide, Lack of vibrations, etc are Good key elements\nto the reduction of Stress and the furtherance of \"Proper Recently (4/2007) I\nhave seen a couple of \"For Sale\" ads for Acrochordus javanicus for one vendor\nthat are wrought with misinformation--therefore: Misguidance on the keeping of\nthese snakes. One ad was for CB Babies basically stating to put them in acidic\nwater and because they are CB and White Spot free--You (the buyer) don't need\nto worry about any future \"Bacterial Infections\". Sorry, it just doesn't work\nthat way. The current ad states: \"I have adult specimens of Acrochordus\njavanicus, about 4' in length. Perfect specimens with no scrapes, scar, and\nmost importantly NO SKIN BLISTERS! As many people know WC adult Acrochordus\njavanicus are very rarely offered for sale, primarily because of the high\nmortality rates due to improper packaging during transport which causes skin\nblisters (Pseudomonas bacteria which cause septicemia, aka \"Blood Poisoning\").\nYou won't have to worry about that here. These adults came in perfectly and\nthere were transported correctly. I am only able to offer unsexed specimens.\nThis species is usually female heavy. There are many reports of this species\nbeing able to be parthogenetic, with LTC females \"cloning\" themselves. A great\ndisplay snake, they feed on fish. As with all Acrochordids, I reccomend great\nfiltration and the regular addition of a product called \"koi zyme.\" I am\nasking $250.00 per a specimen, quanities are limitied. Once these are gone I\nwill be a few more years until such nice large animals come Information.\nImproper packaging/shipping is only one factor and most importantly: \"You\nwon't have to worry about that here.\" That's Pure Non-Sense. I am familiar\nwith this particular individual. He claims to have \"...many years of\nExperience with Aquatic Snakes.\" and apparently did a stint at a local zoo\nwhich I guess makes him a Guru in his own mind. His website is and has\nremained void of his Great claims of \"accomplishments\" (suddenly that's\nchanging 6/07 LoL) and has been up for a few yrs now. Buy the snakes--just\ndon't buy into the BS claims. Apparently this person thinks that you just need\nto buy the \"Clean\" animal from him, toss it into \"acidic water\" via peat moss,\nadd Koizyme and Wha-La: Instant Acrochordus! Again, Sorry, it doesn't work\nthat way. If it were that simple: Someone would have figured it out a Looong\ntime ago. I have used Salt, Koizyme, Melafix and Pimafix. I have also\nresearched those products and contacted the manufactures with any specific\nquestions that I had. One thing that I can tell you is: None. Not One of those\nproducts are necessary to successfully keep an Acrochordus javanicus or\narafurae, Or halt the White Spot Fungus. More importantly, in reference to the\nAds,--Just because You receive a clean animal--doesn't mean that it is going\nto stay that way. That whole thought process is coming from a Total lack of\nExperience. If that were True--Plenty of people would be successfully keeping\nJavanicus. Am I being Hardcore: Maybe. But I don't think that I am. I am tired\nof seeing these snakes die--that's why I am working with them with the\ndedication that I am. That's why I put up this website--including all of the\nhours and hours of putting it together and the added expense. That's why I am\nwilling to Openly call these so-called \"Gurus\" out here--and on the Forums.\nSadly, they don't go \"heads-up\" with me in public any more. They just continue\nto hold onto their erroneous beliefs and pass along their Bad Information.\nThese animals will always go to the skin trade. But let's get it together and\nget them established in captivity, so they will always be around, and so\npeople will be able to experience and enjoy their unique presence. I'm no\nrocket scientist, but I am a guy that can do research and think my way through\nmost problems. If Acrochordus husbandry was as simple as some make it sound:\nThis website would not be here. And You can tell from reading this website\nthat A) its not that simple, and B) its a lot more involved than the \"Gurus\"\nwant You to believe. I have come across a number of individuals that all claim\nthat they have kept Acrochordus snakes long-term. Notice: the Past tense of:\nHAVE! Strangely, None of them happen to be \"Currently\" keeping them. Always--\nPast Tense! Hmmm, I'll leave You to Your Own Conclusions on that one. Just\nBeware of the \"Claims\" out there. Follow the path that You feel is Best--but\nbase it upon Research and, White Spot Fungus? Its caused by Stress and,\nbasically, it appears to be a break-down in the skins ability to protect the\nanimal from the Outside World, eventually leading to Secondary Infections that\nlead to the demise of the snake. There is No \"Magical\" Bacteria that Your\nsnake was or was not exposed to in the wild--these snakes die in captivity\nfrom White spot all over the world--including captivity in Asia that contains\nwater from their own natural environments. Improper Shipping is not the sole\nsource of White Spot, Skin Blister, Whatever. Animals that Arrive in Your\nhands \"Clean\" Will develop White Spot if Housed Improperly and Will die from\nit if the Husbandry Parameters are not Corrected. Wild-caught, Captive Born,\nCaptive Bred and Born--doesn't matter. Tolerance is the only difference\nbetween these animals--Environmental Imprints on their brain. Captive Bred and\nBorn babies are always at least a bit easier then Captive Born babies. Captive\nBorn babies are always a bit easier than Wild-Caught babies. Wild-Caught\nbabies are always easier then Wild-Caught adults. Acrochordus snakes are no\ndifferent. If You see White Spot fungus on Your animal--the First question is:\nIs it Progressing? If it is, then You probably need to fix something. If not,\nthen the animal may just be acclimating (If new or just put into a new setup),\nor the source of stress was temporary and has already been corrected. Is it a\n\"Death Sentence\"? No, definitely Not. So, don't Freak-out and start adding\nSalt or any of that other stuff. Don't start ripping the snake out for Salt\nBaths, Melafix Dips or any of that non-sense. You will just be ADDING stress.\nJust step back and look at the Big Picture. Observe the snake's behavior. Try\nto calmly sort out what may be wrong. As stated in the Javanicus Caresheet: It\ncould be something as simple as Your kid(s) or 150lbs Rottweiler bouncing\naround on the wood floor, or the Thumping from Your too cool Home\nEntertainment System. White Spot Fungus is just an indicator that let's You\nknow that the snake is stressing about something. But it can kill Your snake--\nif You don't do Your Job.

This Information is not\noffered in reference to any snakes other than the Acrochordus javanicus and\nAcrochordus arafurae Filesnakes and even so: use at You Own Risk!\nAdditionally, this caresheet is obviously based upon admittedly limited\nexperience!

The data processing pipeline\nis optimized for LLM performance and ran on the \ud83c\udfed datatrove library, our large\nscale data processing library.\n\n\ud83c\udf77 FineWeb was originally meant to be a fully open replication of \ud83e\udd85 RefinedWeb,\nwith a release of the full dataset under the ODC-By 1.0 license. However, by\ncarefully adding additional filtering steps, we managed to push the\nperformance of \ud83c\udf77 FineWeb well above that of the original \ud83e\udd85 RefinedWeb, and\nmodels trained on our dataset also outperform models trained on other commonly\nused high quality web datasets (like C4, Dolma-v1.6, The Pile, SlimPajama) on\nour aggregate group of benchmark tasks.\n\nThat said, we think there is still room for additional filtering and\nimprovement and intend to continue exploring how to improve the dataset\nquality in coming versions of \ud83c\udf77 FineWeb.\n\n## What is being released?\n\nAlong with the dataset, which includes all CommonCrawl dumps since 2013, we\nalso share all the code needed to fully reproduce our processing setup using\nthe \ud83c\udfed datatrove library here. To enable full replication of our results, we\nhave also published the small ablation models we have trained using nanotron\nto validate the dataset and compare it with other reference datasets. You will\nfind them here, with checkpoints every 1000 steps. We have also published our\nevaluation results here.\n\nYou will find details on the different processing decisions we took and some\ninteresting explorations of deduplication methods and differences between\nCommonCrawl dumps in our technical report to be published in the coming days.\n\n## How to download and use \ud83c\udf77 FineWeb\n\nYou can load the full dataset or a specific crawl/dump (see

1.8B parameters models on 27 billion tokens. To compare \ud83c\udf77 FineWeb\nwith other datasets, we also trained one of these 1.8B models per target\ndataset, on 350 billion tokens sampled from it (or the entire dataset when its\nsize was < 350 billion tokens).\n\n### Hyper-parameters for ablation models\n\nThe detailed configurations for training the 1.8B parameters ablation model\ncan be found here (link will be added soon).\n\n### Ablation evaluation benchmarks\n\nTo conduct the ablations for each of our dataset filtering choices, we\nselected a set of benchmarks which we identified as \u201chigh-signal\u201d benchmarks.\nThese benchmarks were selected according to the following criteria:\n\n  * small variance between runs trained on different samplings of the same dataset\n  * performance increasing monotically during training (or close)\n  * separation between runs on datasets of known quality (C4, The Pile, RedPajama) higher than the variance between runs with various modeling/data seeds\n\nWe used the following list of benchmark for our ablation runs:\n\n  * commonsense_qa (acc_norm)\n  * hellaswag (acc/acc_norm)\n  * openbookqa (acc/acc_norm)\n  * piqa (acc/acc_norm)\n  * siqa (acc/acc_norm)\n  * winogrande (acc/acc_norm)\n  * sciq (acc/acc_norm)\n  * arc (acc/acc_norm)\n  * mmlu (acc/acc_norm)\n\nTo compare runs we consider an aggregate score, the average of the scores for\nthese tasks.\n\nThe prompts for all these benchmarks are formatted in order to compute and\ncompare the log-likelihood of the full answers for each multiple choice\nquestion. All the implementation details for the benchmarks are available in\nlighteval here (link to be added soon).\n\n### Comparison with other datasets\n\nWe compared \ud83c\udf77 FineWeb with the following datasets:\n\n  * RefinedWeb\n  * C4\n  * Dolma v1.6 (the CommonCrawl part)\n  * The Pile\n  * SlimPajama\n\nYou will find these models on this collection. We have uploaded checkpoints at\nevery 1000 training steps. You will also find our full evaluation results\nhere.\n\nNote: The plot is smoothed by averaging 5k steps in a rolling window.\n\n# Dataset card for \ud83c\udf77 FineWeb\n\n### Dataset Summary\n\nThis dataset was created by processing 95 CommonCrawl dumps comprising web\ndata crawled from the summer of 2013 to March of 2024. \ud83c\udf77 FineWeb includes a\nvariety of domains and topics in English and is primarily intended to be used\nas a research artifact on public data in the context of pretraining dataset\nfor large language models. The CommonCrawl data was carefully processed,\nfiltered and deduplicated with the \ud83c\udfed datatrove library, resulting in the\nlargest publicly available clean LLM pretraining dataset, counting around 15\ntrillion tokens (gpt2 tokenizer).\n\n## Dataset Structure\n\n### Data Instances\n\nThe following is an example sample from the dataset. It is part of the CC-\nMAIN-2021-43 and was crawled on 2021-10-15T21:20:12Z.\n\n    \n    \n    { \"text\": \"This is basically a peanut flavoured cream thickened with egg yolks and then set into a ramekin on top of some jam. Tony, one of the Wedgwood chefs, suggested sprinkling on some toasted crushed peanuts at the end to create extra crunch, which I thought was a great idea. The result is excellent.\", \"id\": \"<urn:uuid:e5a3e79a-13d4-4147-a26e-167536fcac5d>\", \"dump\": \"CC-MAIN-2021-43\", \"url\": \"<http://allrecipes.co.uk/recipe/24758/peanut-butter-and-jam-creme-brulee.aspx?o_is=SimilarRecipes&o_ln=SimRecipes_Photo_7>\", \"date\": \"2021-10-15T21:20:12Z\", \"file_path\": \"s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2021-43/segments/1634323583083.92/warc/CC-MAIN-20211015192439-20211015222439-00600.warc.gz\", \"language\": \"en\", \"language_score\": 0.948729, \"token_count\": 69 }\n\n### Data Fields\n\n  * text (string): the main text content\n  * id (string): original unique identifier for this sample from CommonCrawl\n  * dump (string): the CommonCrawl dump this sample was a part of\n  * url (string): url to the original page where text was present\n  * date (string): crawl date (from CommonCrawl)\n  * file_path (string): s3 path for the individual CommonCrawl warc file containing this sample\n  * language (string): en for all the samples in this dataset\n  * language_score (float): language prediction score (0.01.0) as reported by the fastText language classifier\n  * token_count (int): number of tokens when applying the gpt2 tokenizer to this sample\n\n### Data Splits\n\nThe default subset includes the entire dataset. If you would like to only use\nthe data from a particular CommonCrawl dump, you can use the dump name as a\nsubset. You will find the full list of available dumps on the table above.\nFrom experiments we have run, not all dumps give the same performance. For\nrelatively small trainings (<400 billion tokens) we recommend using the recent\nCC-MAIN-2023-50 and CC-MAIN-2024-10. We will share more details about these\nexperiments on our future technical report.\n\n## Dataset Creation\n\n### Curation Rationale\n\nWhile multiple open-weights models have regularly been released in recent\nmonths, these releases often do not include the model's training data. With \ud83c\udf77\nFineWeb we aim to provide the open source community with a very large clean\npretraining dataset that can be used to push the envelope on truly open source\nmodels (open source models where data is also released).\n\n### Source Data\n\nThe source data consists of webpages crawled by the CommonCrawl foundation\nover the 2013-2024 time period.\n\nWe then extracted the main page text from the html of each webpage, carefully\nfiltered each sample and deduplicated each individual CommonCrawl dump/crawl.\n\nWhile we originally intended to deduplicate the dataset as a whole, our\nablations showed that training on a sampling of individually deduplicated\ndumps/crawls outperformed training on a sampling of all the dumps/crawls\ndeduplicated together. We will discuss this further in our technical report.\n\n### Data processing steps\n\nWe used the \ud83c\udfed datatrove library to process the data. You can find a working\nscript that launches the entire processing pipeline here.\n\nThe data processing pipeline consists of:\n\n  1. Url Filtering, removing documents originating from Malicious and NSFW websites, using both block-list as well as subwords detection\n  2. Trafilatura text extraction on the raw HTML from CommonCrawl\u2019s warc files\n  3. FastText LanguageFilter, removing any document with en language score lower than 0.65\n  4. Quality filtering\n\n    1. Gopher Repetition / Quality\n    2. C4 Quality filters except terminal_punct rule\n    3. FineWeb custom filters, consisting of heuristics for removing list-like documents, documents with repeated lines and documents with likely wrong line formatting.\n  5. MinHash deduplication with each crawl deduplicated individually (5-grams, 14x8 hash functions)\n  6. PII Formatting to anonymize email and public IP addresses\n\n### Annotations\n\nWe augment the original samples with the language, language_score and\ntoken_count annotations. The language related annotations are automatically\ngenerated by our language filter. token_count is generated by applying the\ngpt2 tokenizer to the text column.\n\n### Personal and Sensitive Information\n\nWe anonymize email addresses and public IP addresses.\n\nFor emails, we apply a regex pattern and replace any occurrence of an email\naddress with either email@example.com or firstname.lastname@example.org. For\nIP addresses, we also employ a regex pattern and then further filter to only\nanonymize IP addresses allocated for public networks. Matched IP addresses are\nthen replaced with one of the following randomly generated IP addresses, which\nat the time of dataset creation were not responding to ping requests:\n22.214.171.124, 126.96.36.199, 188.8.131.52, 184.108.40.206, 220.127.116.11,\nand 18.104.22.168. We decided against applying regex patterns for phone\nnumbers due to the high false positive rate.\n\nDespite our efforts, given that \ud83c\udf77 FineWeb is sourced from the internet at\nlarge, it is very likely that some personable identifiable information (PII)\nwill be present. If you find your own PII in \ud83c\udf77 FineWeb and would like it\nremoved, please fill out our PII removal form (available soon).\n\n## Considerations for Using the Data\n\n### Social Impact of Dataset\n\nWith the release of this dataset we aim to make model training more accessible\nto the machine learning community at large.\n\nWhile multiple open-weights models with strong performance have been publicly\nreleased in the past, more often than not these releases are not accompanied\nby the corresponding training dataset. This is unfortunate as the dataset\nspecificities and characteristics have been demonstrated to have a very large\nimpact and role in the performances of the models. As the creation of a high\nquality training dataset is a fundamental requirement to training an LLM\ncapable of excelling at downstream tasks, with \ud83c\udf77 FineWeb we (a) not only make\nthe dataset creation process more transparent, by sharing our entire\nprocessing setup including the codebase used, we also (b) help alleviate the\ncosts of dataset curation, both in time and in compute, for model creators by\npublicly releasing our dataset with the community.\n\n### Discussion of Biases\n\nEfforts were made to minimize the amount of NSFW and toxic content present in\nthe dataset by employing filtering on the URL level. However, there are still\na significant number of documents present in the final dataset that could be\nconsidered toxic or contain harmful content. As \ud83c\udf77 FineWeb was sourced from the\nweb as a whole, any harmful biases typically present in it may be reproduced\non our dataset.\n\nWe deliberately avoided using machine learning filtering methods that define\ntext quality based on the similarity to a \u201cgold\u201d source such as wikipedia or\ntoxicity classifiers as these methods have been known to disproportionately\nremove content in specific dialects and overclassify as toxic text related to\nspecific social identities, respectively.\n\n### Other Known Limitations\n\nAs a consequence of some of the filtering steps applied, it is likely that\ncode content is not prevalent in our dataset. If you are training a model that\nshould also perform code tasks, we recommend you use \ud83c\udf77 FineWeb with a code\ndataset, such as The Stack v2. You should also probably consider complementing\n\ud83c\udf77 FineWeb with specialized curated sources (such as Wikipedia, for example) as\nthey will likely have better formatting than the wikipedia content included in\n\ud83c\udf77 FineWeb (we did not tailor the processing to individual websites).\n\n## Additional Information\n\n### Licensing Information\n\nThe dataset is released under the Open Data Commons Attribution License (ODC-\nBy) v1.0 license.
