The underdogs. The resolute. The determined. The\nindefatigable. The outsiders. The defiant. The independent thinkers. The\nfighters and the true believers.\n\nThese are the founders with whom we partner. They\u2019re extremely rare. And we\u2019re\necstatic when we find them.\n\nWe partner early\u2014sometimes when a company is no more than an idea. We know\nthese crucial first decisions can have an exponential influence on the curve\nof success.\n\nOur style is not for everyone. We push when we see potential. We are direct.\nSome don\u2019t like our approach. Most who know us do.\n\nOur team mirrors the founders with whom we partner: hungry overachievers with\na deep-rooted need to win. Many come from humble backgrounds. Many are\nimmigrants. Many formed or built companies of their own before joining\nSequoia. Each shares the mindset of an entrepreneur, and knows what it means\nto walk that path.\n\nWe value teamwork over showmanship. Our contribution to a company always comes\nfrom several of us working together. We\u2019re skittish about the first person\nsingular, and don\u2019t care to see our names in the press.\n\nOur team is small. We prefer a few people with diverse strengths focused on a\nsmall number of companies, and we are always mindful of lessons learned \u2014 some\npainfully \u2014 that are eternal truths. Our network is strong. Our advantage\ncomes from five decades of legendary founders helping each other.\n\nLong ago we made nonprofits the backbone of our limited partner base. Working\nfor these charities brings intense meaning to what we do. It gives us a\nheightened sense of responsibility.\n\nWe\u2019re serious about our work, and carefully choose the words to describe it.\nTerms like \u201cdeal\u201d or \u201cexit\u201d are forbidden. And while we\u2019re sometimes called\ninvestors, that is not our frame of mind. We consider ourselves partners for\nthe long term.\n\nWe help the daring build legendary companies, from idea to IPO and beyond.\n\nBy navigating this website you agree to our cookie policy.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Sequoia Capital\n\n", "frontpage": false}
