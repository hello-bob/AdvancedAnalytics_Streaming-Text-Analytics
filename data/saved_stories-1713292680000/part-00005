The games are played twice a year, normally on\nChristmas Day and New Year's Day, unless those days fall on a Sunday in which\ncase the game is moved to the following day.\n\nPlayed in the town centre of Kirkwall, the two sides are the Uppies and the\nDoonies, or more correctly, \"Up-the-Gates\" and \"Doon-the-Gates\" from Norn gata\n(path or road), although it is also common in Scots. The tradition belongs to\nKirkwall and the surrounding area of St Ola, and has always been played by men\nfrom those two areas since before records began. In the past 50 years, mainly\ndue to improved transport, the game's popularity has grown to include players\nfrom all areas of Orkney, including some of the outer isles. This has not met\nwith universal approval from those associated with the game as its sheer size\nhas become a problem from a safety perspective.\n\nScant information is available about the early history but some form of mass\nfootball appears to have been practised throughout Scotland and England for at\nleast three centuries.^[2] Records from 1797 indicate that \"Football is the\nprincipal diversion of the common people, which they practise with great\ndexterity\".^[3] There is speculation that the game in Kirkwall may have its\nroots in folklore based on the tale of Sigurd and the Orkneyinga saga.^[2]\n\n## Boys Ba'[edit]\n\nThe Boys Ba', as the name suggests, is restricted to those aged 15 years and\nbelow. There is no restriction on the lower age limit and small boys of\nsometimes as young as 5 years old can be seen around the edges, making their\nfirst tentative steps into the game. The Boys Ba' is thrown up from the Merket\nCross on the Kirk Green on front of St Magnus Cathedral at 10.00,^[4] the\nstart time recently having been moved from 10.30 due to the Boys Ba' having a\ntendency to last longer. The Boys game, like the Men's, has grown in size and\npopularity in recent years and the number of boys participating can number\nover 100.\n\nThe Boys Ba' has been known to last as little as 4 minutes (New Years Day\n1985) or as long as 6 hours (New Years Day 2019). It can be very fluid, with\nits outcome often decided by a \"break\" whereby one of the faster boys manages\nto break free of the scrum and runs with the ba', making valuable ground,\nsometimes making it all the way to his team's goal, thereby ending the game.\nBoy's Ba' winners, in the sense of the individual boy who is awarded the ba'\nafter the game as his personal property, will normally be boys playing in\ntheir final games prior to turning 16 years old, although there are occasions\nin history where a younger boy has managed to make off home with it, thereby\nclaiming the ba' as his, despite having further years left to play in the boys\ngame. Nowadays this is generally frowned upon, the conventional wisdom being\nthat younger boys will have other chances to win a Ba', whereas the\n15\u2010year\u2010olds will not.\n\nAlthough a great honour, winning a Boy's Ba' does not affect status when\nmoving up to the men's game. All young players are considered equal and must\nprove themselves on their individual performances in the Men's Ba'. Indeed,\nmany players who were prominent in the boy's game prove to be otherwise when\nthey step up to the Men's game, and vice versa.\n\n## Men's Ba'[edit]\n\nThe Men's Ba' is thrown up also from the Merket Cross, when the cathedral bell\nstrikes 13:00. The person chosen to \"throw up\" the ba', or begin the game, is\nusually an older Ba' stalwart,^[5] but the honour is occasionally given to\nsome local public figure.\n\nThe waiting scrum can number up to 350 men and can be a sight to behold. Once\nthrown up, the Ba' disappears into the scrum and much surging play occurs\nwhile the two sides weigh each other up and determine who has the weight on\ntheir side on this occasion. Much exciting surging and turning play often\noccurs on this wider part of the street, which can frequently determine the\noutcome.\n\nOccasionally, the ba' appears out of the scrum and someone makes a dash\nthrough the crowds of spectators. To the casual onlooker this can happen at\nany moment, but the seasoned Ba' watcher can often see what is happening long\nbefore the ba' suddenly erupts. Breaks sometimes occur on Broad Street, but\ncan occur anywhere where one side gains sufficient control of part of the\nscrum.\n\nThe Doonies have the benefit of a flat push to Albert Street, while the Uppies\nhave a hard push up to the top of Tankerness Lane. The game may also go down\none of the flagstone lanes, or down Castle Street onto the open Junction Road.\nOnce there either side may gain the upper hand by means of a smuggle and run,\nor the scrum may become immobile in one of the many closes and yards.\n\nHowever, if the Uppies manage to enter Victoria Street, or the Doonies Albert\nStreet, the opposition have a much harder time, due to the narrowness and the\npress of often many hundreds of keen spectators. All the same the Ba' may be\nrestricted for several hours in any of the many lanes and neither side ever\ngives up the struggle until the goal is reached.\n\n## Women's Ba'[edit]\n\nImmediately after the end of World War II there was a movement to establish a\nBa' game for women in Kirkwall. There were only ever two Women's Ba' games\nplayed, on Christmas Day 1945 and New Years Day 1946. The first ever winner of\nthe Women's Ba' was Barbara Yule who was an Uppie. Following her death in 1999\nthe ba' she had kept since she won it, was returned to Orkney, and is on\ndisplay in The Orkney Museum in Kirkwall. The second winner was Violet Couper\nwho was also an Uppie. The two games played did not follow the pattern of the\nmen's game and were very much running games. The women's game was abolished in\nsubsequent years. History records the reasons for its discontinuation as being\na general public dislike for female participation in a very physical and\npublic spectacle, the attitudes of the time being that it was not \"lady-\nlike\".^[6]\n\n## Goals[edit]\n\nThe Doonies' goal is the sea, normally within the Basin of the Harbour, but so\nlong as it is immersed in the salt water of Kirkwall Bay, the Ba' has gone\ndoon. The Uppies must round the Lang, or Mackinson's corner at the junction of\nMain Street with New Scapa Road, opposite the Catholic Church, which was the\nsite of the old town gates in bygone times. (The last remains of the town\ngates were removed in the 1950s, leaving the Uppie goal as the gable end of a\nhouse on Mackinson's Corner.)\n\n## Awarding the Ba'[edit]\n\nOnce the Ba' has been goaled Up or Doon, lengthy argument often ensues among\nplayers on the winning side before a popular individual winner is acclaimed.\nThis winner is awarded the trophy of the game, which is the ba' itself. When\nthe winner is finally decided, he is normally held aloft and carried shoulder-\nhigh from the goal by his teammates in celebration, passing into the ranks of\nBa' winners and into Kirkwall history.\n\nTo stalwart Ba' players, the ultimate honour is to be awarded a ba'. To have\nany chance of this honour, a player generally has to have played consistently\nwell for a long period of time (usually around 20 years minimum). Ba' winners\nrange from outstanding players in their early thirties to veterans in their\nmid to late forties.\n\nThere are several players who are what is known as a \"double winner\" in that\nthey have been awarded both a Boys' Ba' and a Men's Ba' during their playing\ncareers.\n\n## Uppie or Doonie?[edit]\n\nOriginally the side any individual played on was decided by whether he was\nborn up or doon the gate but when Kirkwall's Balfour Hospital was built in the\n1950s, the majority of babies were born there, thus giving a heavy bias to the\nUppies. This led to a swing toward family allegiances, meaning players played\nthe same way as their forebears. This tradition continues to this day. For\nnon-Orcadians or ferryloupers (incomers) or indeed anyone with no family\nhistory in the game, and often people from the isles or rural areas, their\nside is determined by the route taken on their first arrival in Kirkwall.\n\n## Safety[edit]\n\nThe game has no official rules, but there is a code of honour among players\nwhereby certain acts are considered strictly unacceptable. This code is\ngenerally adhered to extremely well by those who play the game and as result\nthe game is self-regulating and self-policing, requiring no intervention from\noutside parties.\n\nThe game's popularity in recent times has led to the scrum of men becoming\nvery large with up to 350 men playing at any one time. Forces within the scrum\ncan be enormous, with broken and cracked ribs not uncommon. The scrum will\ncollapse often during the game, at which point players are generally very good\nat ceasing play and aiding teammate and opponent alike to regain their feet.\n\nCamaraderie within the game is excellent, although as with any highly physical\nmale pursuit, tempers can and do flare. Such incidents are quickly\nextinguished by fellow players and grudges are not held.\n\nThe participation of visitors in the game is not encouraged, mainly for safety\nreasons but also as Orcadians are very protective of their tradition and do\nnot wish to see it become a pursuit for \"adventure tourists\" as has happened\nwith several other UK traditional ball games. The current scrum has become\nvery large and those associated with the game believe that further players,\nparticularly ones who have no appreciation of the dangers, tactics,\nallegiances or history of the game, will be no asset from a safety point of\nview. This view is endorsed almost universally throughout the game.\n\n## References[edit]\n\nCitations\n\n  1. ^ Saslow, Eli (2007-12-30). \"Tradition: The Old Ba' Game\". The Washington Post.
