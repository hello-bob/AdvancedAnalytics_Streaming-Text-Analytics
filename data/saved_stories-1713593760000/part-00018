By using a\ndistinct word we avoid that tar pit entirely. This concern seems increasingly\nimportant in an era where folks feel they need to be more careful in a\nprofessional or academic context lest they be accused of racism or\ndiscrimination.\n\nAs a bonus the new term also enables an unambiguous search filter.\n\nOther anti-patterns of concurrency like deadlock and livelock can continue to\nuse the existing terms, because they dont have the problems with ambiguity.\n\n### Subscribe to Synystron Synlogica\n\nLaunched 10 months ago\n\non programming, software engineering, performance & scalability, climate,\ndemocracy, Utopianism, sci-fi and comedy...\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Malconcurrency: A Proposed New Term\n\nsynystron.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nRIP Bram Moolenaar\n\nRIP Bram Moolenaar (I just heard about it.
