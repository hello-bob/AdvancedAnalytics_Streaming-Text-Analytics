The information\nis critical as flu experts fear the outbreak is heightening the ever-present\nrisk that this wily flu virus will evolve to spread among humans and spark a\npandemic.\n\nBut, the information hasn't been easy to come by. Since March 25\u2014when the USDA\nconfirmed for the first time that a herd of US dairy cows had contracted the\nhighly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus\u2014the agency has garnered\ninternational criticism for not sharing data quickly or completely. On April\n21, the agency dumped over 200 genetic sequences into public databases amid\npressure from outside experts. However, many of those sequences lack\ndescriptive metadata, which normally contains basic and key bits of\ninformation, like when and where the viral sample was taken. Outside experts\ndon't have that crucial information, making independent analyses frustratingly\nlimited. Thus, the new USDA analysis\u2014which presumably includes that\ndata\u2014offers the best yet glimpse of the complete information on the outbreak.\n\n## Undetected spread\n\nOne of the big takeaways is that USDA researchers think the spillover of bird\nflu from wild birds to cattle began late last year, likely in December. Thus,\nthe virus likely circulated undetected in dairy cows for around four months\nbefore the USDA's March 25 confirmation of an infection in a Texas herd.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis timeline conclusion largely aligns with what outside experts previously\ngleaned from the limited publicly available data. So, it may not surprise\nthose following the outbreak, but it is worrisome. Months of undetected spread\nraise significant concerns about the country's ability to identify and swiftly\nrespond to emerging infectious disease outbreaks\u2014and whether public health\nresponses have moved past the missteps seen in the early stages of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBut another big finding from the preprint is how many gaps still exist in our\ncurrent understanding of the outbreak. To date, the USDA has identified 36\nherds in nine states that have been infected with H5N1. The good news from the\ngenetic analysis is that the USDA can draw lines connecting most of them. USDA\nresearchers reported that \"direct movement of cattle based upon production\npractices\" seems to explain how H5N1 hopped from the Texas panhandle\nregion\u2014where the initial spillover is thought to have occurred\u2014to nine other\nstates, some as far-flung as North Carolina, Michigan, and Idaho.\n\nEnlarge / Bayes factors for inferred movement between different discrete\ntraits of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses demonstrating the frequency of movement.\n\nBioRxiv, Nguyen et al.\n\nEnlarge / Putative transmission pathways of HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b genotype\nB3.13 supported by epidemiological links, animal movements, and genomic\nanalysis.\n\nBioRxiv, Nguyen et al.\n\nPutative transmission pathways of HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b genotype B3.13\nsupported by epidemiological links, animal movements, and genomic analysis.\n[/ars_img]The bad news is that those lines connecting the herds aren't solid.\nThere are gaps in which the genetic data suggests unidentified transmission\noccurred, maybe in unsampled cows, maybe in other animals entirely. The\ngenetic data is clear that once this strain of bird flu\u2014H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4\ngenotype B3.13 \u2014hopped into cattle, it could readily spread to other mammals.\nThe genetic data links viruses from cattle moving many times into other\nanimals: There were five cattle-to-poultry jumps, one cattle-to-raccoon\ntransmission, two events where the virus moved from cattle to domestic cats,\nand three times when the virus from cattle spilled back into wild birds.\n\n\"We cannot exclude the possibility that this genotype is circulating in\nunsampled locations and hosts as the existing analysis suggests that data are\nmissing and undersurveillance may obscure transmission inferred using\nphylogenetic methods,\" the USDA researchers wrote in their preprint.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### What Happens to the Developers When AI Can Code? | Ars Frontiers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n77\n\nBeth Mole Beth is Ars Technica\u2019s Senior Health Reporter.
