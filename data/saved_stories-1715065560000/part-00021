This time we\u2019re bringing two major features to Aria, Opera\u2019s\nnative browser AI: image generation, and the ability to have Aria read text\nanswers aloud.\n\nTo give you a little recap, we recently shipped on-device (local) LLMs as part\nof our AI Features Drop program.\n\nBut let\u2019s take a look at what today\u2019s additions have to offer.\n\n## Aria Now Generates Images from your words\n\nWith this update, Aria can now turn your text prompts and descriptions into\nunique images. Aria will recognize if you intend to generate an image based on\nthe conversation prompts that you give it. Whether you want to create visual\nassets for a presentation or a fun picture of a dog on the beach, Aria will\ngenerate it for you using the image generation model Imagen2 by Google.\n\nTo generate an image, first open up a chat with Aria in the sidebar or in the\nCommand Line* by pressing ctrl + / or cmd + /. Then you need to give Aria a\nprompt indicating that you want to generate an image followed by the\ndescription of what you want in it.\n\nHere\u2019s an example: we asked Aria to make an image of a dog on vacation at a\nbeach having a drink.\n\nNow we have an image of a dog on the beach, great! However, the dog is missing\nits drink, right? If you are not satisfied with the image that Aria has\ngenerated, you can hit the \u201cregenerate\u201d button located in the top right corner\nof the picture.\n\nOnce you have clicked the regenerate button, Aria will make a new image for\nyou. Now the dog is on the beach and has a nice drink to enjoy!\n\nYou can keep the conversation with Aria going and adjust your prompts to guide\nthe image generation. Aria will consider your earlier requests as well as the\nnew instructions to create a refined result for you. So, if you want to\nfurther alter the image, you can give more prompts to Aria without the need to\nrepeat everything all over again. For example, we want our dog on the beach to\nhave blue glasses instead of red:\n\nNow the beach party is ready to start and we have a paw-some image to show\noff! All it took was a few prompts and Aria\u2019s new talents got it done. This\nnew feature allows you up to 30 opportunities each day to bring your ideas to\nlife!\n\nRemember that you will need to download the Developer version of the Opera\nbrowser to start using Aria\u2019s newest Feature Drops such as the image\ngeneration.\n\n## Voice Output: Aria can read aloud\n\nThe second feature coming to the Developer stream of the browser with an\nupdate that enables Aria to read text answers out loud. This feature is great\nfor accessibility, multitasking, or simply getting information in a different\nformat. To have Aria read text answers, the first step is to start a chat via\nthe sidebar icon or using the Command Line*: ctrl + / or cmd + /.\n\nIf you started a regular chat with Aria in the sidebar, you can hover over the\nresponse to get different options. You\u2019ll need to click on the speaker icon to\nhear Aria\u2019s new, life-like voice.\n\nIf you start a chat with Aria via the Command Line* (ctrl + / or cmd + /),\nthen you\u2019ll see the speaker icon on the bottom right corner. Click on it to\nhave Aria read the text response that has been generated to answer your query.\n\nOnce Aria starts speaking, you can easily stop the dialogue by pressing the\npause button that will replace the speaker icon. Clicking the speaker icon\nagain will restart the dialogue from the beginning.\n\nAria will do its best to select the relevant language for spoken responses, as\nit continues to improve its linguistic skills.\n\nAria\u2019s also learning to speak more naturally! For this Feature Drop, it\u2019s\ncurrently using the Basic version of Google\u2019s Wavenet model.\n\nWe believe these features will streamline your browsing and inspire even more\ninnovative ways to interact with Aria. These are still early days, and we\nappreciate feedback on Aria\u2019s new features!\n\n## Discover Aria\u2019s Image Generation and Voice Output now\n\nIf you want to give these features a try, download Opera Developer! Join us in\nour AI Feature Drops program, and don\u2019t miss out on the latest AI updates for\nOpera.\n\n*In some cases \u2013 and depending on your keyboard layout \u2013 the Aria Command Line can vary due to different positioning of the forward slash ( / ) character, for example, in the Nordics it is ctrl/cmd + shift + 7.\n\n# Santiago Benavides Garc\u00eda\n\nAIAI Feature DropsAriadeveloperImage GenerationOperaopera developerupdateVoice\nOutput\n\n### User comments\n\nComments: 1\n\n  * burnout426 Volunteer1 week ago\n\nCreating thread.\n\nView forum thread\n\n### You deserve a better browser\n\nFaster, safer and smarter than default browsers.
