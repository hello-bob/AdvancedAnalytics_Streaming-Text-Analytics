Today we\u2019ll\nmeet a second guy, Friedrich Wilhelm von Struve, who revisited the same\nproblem in the 1800s.\n\nA lot had happened scientifically since Eratosthenes made his calculation. In\nhis time, the general belief was that the Earth had the shape of a perfect\nsphere. But when Isaac Newton discovered gravity and centrifugal force in the\n1600s, he also suggested that, because of its rotation around its own axis,\nthe Earth would actually spread out into an ellipsoidal shape, like a sphere\nbut flattened at the poles.\n\nUnlike a sphere, an ellipsoid is shorter than it is tall. The Earth takes this\nshape because it spins on its axis \u2014 the same way spinning a ball of dough\nwill flatten it into a disc.\n\nOf course, the changes weren\u2019t just scientific. While Eratosthenes\u2019\ncalculation was more of a theoretical experiment, now the measurement of the\nEarth has a concrete application: The age of European exploration and\ncolonization had created a need for accurate mapping and navigation. General\ncuriosity and interest in science that grew in the Age of Enlightenment\ncombined with concrete political, military, and economic applications in\nnavigation and mapping.\n\n### A more modern way to measure\n\nThe weakest point in Eratosthenes\u2019 calculation was his measurement of the\ndistance between two far-apart locations. In 250 BCE, there was no better way\nto do this than by pacing out the distance on foot!\n\nA much better method, triangulation, was established in the 1600s.\nTriangulation relies on a basic geometrical fact: Knowing the distance between\ntwo points of a triangle, plus the measure of their two angles, is enough to\nfully determine the location of the third point.\n\nTwo surveyors stand at points A and B, whose distance from each other (AB) is\nalready known. Measuring the angles (\u03b1 and \u03b2) of their line of sight to point\nC is then enough to exactly determine C\u2018s distance and position. (A church\nwith an easily visible tower was a common choice for surveying.)\n\nUsing this fact, a surveyor can start from two relatively close points with a\nknown distance and find the location of a farther point, and then a farther\npoint, eventually creating a long chain of small triangles with precisely\ncalculated locations. In theory, it could be a really, really long chain.\nSomething like...\n\nThe Struve Geodetic Arc is a chain of 256 triangulation points, spanning from\nthe north of Norway to the Black Sea. It was established between 1816 and 1864\nwith the purpose of measuring the flattening of Earth\u2019s ellipsoid, and from\nthere the size of the whole globe. Since 2005, the points in the triangulation\nnetwork, including 34 marked with obelisks, have been a UNESCO World Heritage\nSite.\n\nToday, the Arc stretches across ten different countries, the most of any\nUNESCO cultural site. Measuring it was a huge international project with\nhundreds of collaborators that took decades to complete. In this way, it has a\nlot more in common with the big scientific projects of today than with the\nmethods of Eratosthenes\u2019 time.\n\nSo who was behind it \u2014 and how did they get it done?\n\n### The many maps of 19th century Europe\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm von Struve was born in 1793 to an aristocratic family in\nAltona.\n\nIt was very unsettled time politically in Europe, with the dissolution of the\nHoly Roman Empire and the chaos of the Napoleonic Wars from 1803 to 1815. When\nStruve was born, his hometown of Altona was located in Holstein, the\nnorthernmost vassal state of the Holy Roman Empire \u2014 but (just to keep things\nconfusing) the Duke of Holstein was actually the Danish king, and the duchy\nwas administered as part of the Kingdom of Denmark. At the time, Altona was\nthe second largest city in Denmark and an important trading city because it\nwas close to river Elbe.\n\nWhen the Holy Roman Empire dissolved in 1806, the status of Holstein was\nunclear. For a few years it remained under Danish rule, while the neighboring\ncity of Hamburg was occupied by Napoleon. (Later, in 1815, Holstein would\nbecome a part of the German confederation under a personal union with\nDenmark.)\n\nWith Napoleon's army right across the river, Altona was also facing a\npotential occupation, so to avoid military service the family left Holstein\nand settled down in the city of Dorpat, in what was then the Russian Empire\nand today is Tartu, Estonia. Since the 13th century, Estonia had had a large\nGerman minority population. The University of Dorpat, where Struve went on to\nlead his research, had reopened in 1802 as a German-speaking institution and\nwas the 11th largest university in Europe to use German as its teaching\nlanguage.\n\nIn such an unsettled time, it\u2019s easy to see why mapping for military purposes\nwas really an important task. But an accurate framework for navigation and\nsurveying was lacking.\n\n### How to measure the Earth, again\n\nThe goal was to create one common, global geographic reference system. And for\na global system, the flattening of the Earth\u2019s ellipsoid is an important\nparameter. Expeditions sent in the 1730s to Peru and Lapland had already\nproved Newton's theory of an ellipsoidal Earth to be correct, but they were\ntoo small to make good estimates of the Earth's actual size.\n\nThe principle behind Struve\u2019s measurements is exactly the same as the one\nEratosthenes used 2000 years earlier: Measure a distance along some meridian\nand calculate its fraction of the Earth\u2019s whole circumference. This time,\ntriangulation would allow for a more accurate measurement of the distance, and\nthe discovery of gravitation and the Earth\u2019s flattened shape would allow for a\nmore accurate calculation.\n\nTo measure the size of the whole world, the triangulation chain needs to be\nreally large \u2014 and that\u2019s not just a scientific challenge, but an\ninstitutional and political one. But in this case, the political map of the\nera actually worked to Struve\u2019s advantage:\n\nIn its own day, the Arc crossed only one international border, between Sweden-\nNorway and the Russian Empire. In Russia a major surveying campaign had\nalready begun in 1816, with the goal of creating a triangulation network\nacross the entire Empire; it was led by Karl Tenner, a colonel in the Russian\narmy. Struve presented a more scientific approach, which would also determine\nthe dimensions of the Earth, to Czar Alexander I in 1819. Luckily, science was\none of the czar\u2019s top interests, so Struve got all the resources he needed to\njoin forces with Colonel Tenner and start the daunting task of setting up\ntriangulation points from the northern coast of Norway all the way to the\nBlack Sea. Struve chose his hometown of Dorpat as their point zero; Colonel\nTenner and his team started to build the chain southwards from there while\nStruve\u2019s team traveled north.\n\nIn total, the chain had 258 triangles formed by 256 measurement points, which\nwere marked by anything from a simple hole drilled in a rock to a\ncommemorative obelisk. Observations of latitude were made at 13 selected\nstations, giving 12 arcs from which to compute the length of 1o of curvature.\n(The further north you go, the longer one degree is \u2014 a reflection of Earth's\nellipsoid shape.) Ten triangle sides in the network were measured directly\nusing a set of wrought iron bars laid end-to-end.\n\nMeasuring a baseline of the network (Museum of Pulkova)\n\nThe measurement campaign took almost 40 years. Struve was able to conclude\nthat the length of the meridian arc was 2,821,833 meters. Unfortunately, he\nbecame ill and died before the results could be fully compiled and so was\nunable to determine the curvature and full size of the Earth himself. But the\nproject's measurements ultimately resulted in a calculation for Earth's\nsemimajor axis of 6,378,398 meters, within three hundred meters of the value\nthat's used today.\n\nStruve was very thorough when he marked the triangulation points, and almost\nall of them can still be found today. It\u2019s amazing to consider the\ndetermination that was needed to coordinate so many people on such a large\nproject using the tools of the day, and what an accurate result they were able\nto achieve together. In fact, triangulation remained the most accurate method\nfor measuring long distances until very recently \u2014 when the invention of\nsatellite navigation systems in the 1980s meant it was time to measure the\nworld again.\n\nI hope you're enjoying these Map Stories \u2014 until next time!\n\nAnna Thieme\n\n(she/her) is a basemap creator on Datawrapper\u2019s support and customer success\nteam, and takes care of adding and updating administrative regions for our\nchoropleth and symbol maps.
