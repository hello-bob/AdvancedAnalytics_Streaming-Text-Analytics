Some 25\nmillion kilometers (15.5 million miles) of paved roads are expected to be\nbuilt in just the four decades leading up to 2050 \u2014 enough to wrap around the\nequator more than 600 times. But much of this construction is happening under\nthe radar. Networks of unmapped, unregulated and often illegal roads are\ninsidiously spreading into fragile ecosystems. If left unchecked, they\nthreaten to wreak a devastating toll on tropical forests, according to new\nresearch.\n\nThe new study, published April 10 in Nature, documents 1.37 million km\n(851,000 mi) of roads sprawling across the islands of New Guinea, Borneo and\nSumatra, three hotspots of biodiversity in Southeast Asia and the Pacific that\ncontain the largest combined expanse of tropical rainforest in the world\noutside the Amazon and the Congo Basin. This total length of roads is between\nthree and 6.6 times more than recorded in officially recognized databases.\n\nThe researchers say the discrepancy indicates the presence of a glut of what\nthey term \u201cghost roads\u201d: informally or illicitly constructed roads carved by\nloggers, miners, land grabbers or speculators. Typically falling outside of\nthe purview of environmental governance, ghost roads create blind spots in\nzoning and law enforcement, ultimately posing one of the gravest conservation\nthreats facing the world\u2019s forests.\n\n\u201cRoads are often a death-knell for ecosystems, especially ghost roads, which\nare often illegal and unregulated,\u201d William Laurance, study co-author and a\ndistinguished research professor at James Cook University in Australia, told\nMongabay in an email. \u201cAs they proliferate, roads can open up a native forest\nlike a flayed fish.\u201d\n\nLogging trucks use an informal road to access forests in Sabah, Malaysian\nBorneo.

But when regulation is lacking, roads have been likened\nto \u201carteries of destruction\u201d in tropical forests, paving the way for the\nextraction of timber, minerals, wildlife and other resources, leaving a hollow\nand lifeless landscape in their wake.\n\nThe sheer number of unmapped roads infiltrating the study region is shocking,\nthe authors say. \u201cIn Borneo, none of the existing datasets covered even one-\nthird of the total amount of roads,\u201d Jayden Engert, lead author of the study\nand a doctoral candidate at James Cook University, told Mongabay. \u201cIn some\nareas, the [official dataset] coverage was less than 5%!\u201d\n\nGhost roads are \u201cproliferating wildly,\u201d according to Laurance, \u201cespecially in\ndeveloping nations that harbor much of Earth\u2019s biodiversity.\u201d The\nInternational Energy Agency estimates that nine-tenths of the world\u2019s\nburgeoning road construction is slated for countries in the Global South,\nwhere governance is often hampered by corruption and a lack of financial and\ntechnical resources. Therefore, finding ways to keep track of informal and\nunregulated roads will be vital to minimizing their environmental harms,\nLaurance added.\n\nUsing high-resolution satellite images, the team of researchers from Indonesia\nand Australia worked with more than 200 trained research volunteers to\nmanually map roadways in 1.42 million plots of land, each measuring 1 km2 (0.4\nmi2). Scrutinizing all the images to pick out each road, often amid dense and\nremote forest, amounted to 7,000 hours of volunteer effort. They then compared\ntheir data set with two globally recognized official databases: the Global\nRoads Inventory Project, and OpenStreetMap.\n\nRoad-killed Malayan tapir (Tapirus indicus) in northern Peninsular Malaysia.\nPhoto \u00a9WWF-Malaysia.\n\n### Roads precede deforestation\n\nMore than one-third of the roads identified as ghost roads were located in oil\npalm or other plantations across the study region; nearly one-third were in\nnonplantation agriculture; and up to 39% webbed their way into intact forests.\nThe study cautions that by reducing the costs of transporting forest\ncommodities, such as timber, minerals and poached wildlife, roads \u2014 which are\ntypically linked with agriculture in the tropics \u2014 rapidly promote\ndeforestation.\n\nTo study the deforestation trends associated with roads over time, the team\nanalyzed satellite imagery from between 1985 and 2020 in 12 large landscapes\nacross the study region. They found that deforestation typically peaks soon\nafter a road first penetrates into a landscape. Thereafter, the rate of forest\nloss slows as road density increases and accessible forests are eroded out of\nexistence. Of 38 environmental, demographic and socioeconomic factors the\nresearchers tested, the presence of roads was found to be the strongest\npredictor of deforestation.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the team found that roads cause just as much deforestation within\nprotected areas as they do outside of such safeguarded lands. Once the team\ncontrolled for road density, they found that protected areas had only a modest\nadditional effect on preventing forest loss. \u201cThis suggests [that] protected\nareas can only actually reduce deforestation if they prevent road building,\u201d\nEngert said.\n\nBut roads continue to scythe their way into protected areas the world over,\naccording to Laurance. A major worry, he said, is the trend of road and other\ninfrastructure construction within protected areas for mining and fossil fuel\nextraction \u2014 an insidious phenomenon often leading to what is known as\n\u201cPADDD,\u201d or protected area downgrading, downsizing and degazettement. \u201cOur\nstudy helps to illustrate just how damaging PADDD can be for protected areas,\u201d\nLaurance said.\n\nIllegal roads, like the one above in the Republic of the Congo, often cut\nthrough dense forests, exposing fragile ecosystems to extractive industry and\nother harms. Image by Bill Laurance.\n\n### Megaprojects afoot\n\nState-led plans to transform forested regions in many parts of the study area\ninto economic and industrial powerhouses feature efforts to improve road\ninfrastructure. Megaprojects such as the Pan Borneo Highway and the Trans\nSumatra Toll Road risk opening up a plethora of threats to once-inaccessible\nforested land through illegal offshoots.\n\nTo curb the proliferation of ghost roads branching off from new major\nhighways, Laurance said it will be vital to ensure the surrounding land is\nlegally protected. \u201cOtherwise, it\u2019s far too easy for land invaders to clear\nforests and engage in land speculation \u2014 or for poachers, illegal gold miners,\nloggers or drug producers to invade the forests,\u201d he said.\n\nThe findings from Sumatra, Borneo and New Guinea reflect patterns uncovered in\nprevious studies in other parts of the world. Studies in the Brazilian Amazon,\nCameroon and the Solomon Islands, for instance, have documented between 2.8\nand 9.9 times more road length than reported in official databases.\n\nCarlos Souza Jr., an associate researcher at Brazilian conservation nonprofit\nImazon, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said it\u2019s a good example of how\ncitizen science can be leveraged to make labor-intensive and challenging tasks\nmore achievable. \u201cMapping roads with visual interpretation is labor\nintensive,\u201d he said. \u201cThe study demonstrates well how crowdsourcing can be\nused to solve scientific problems.\u201d\n\nSatellite image of forest clearing associated with roads in the Brazilian\nAmazon. Image by Google Earth.]\n\n### Road-tracking tech needed\n\nSouza said he\u2019s hopeful that artificial intelligence technologies can\naccelerate road mapping at scale, a feat he said will ultimately help to guide\npolicymakers and conservationists in their efforts to protect forests and\npeople from illicit land incursions and deforestation. He was part of a team\nthat in 2022 combined satellite monitoring with artificial intelligence\nalgorithms to reveal that 41% of the Brazilian Amazon is already bisected by\nroads or located within 10 km (6 mi) of one.\n\nLarge data sets, like that of the new study, will be vital to train such AI-\nbased road-mapping systems, Souza added. \u201cThe next step is to apply AI to all\ntropical forests,\u201d he said. \u201cThe AI must be combined with Human Intelligence\n(HI) to use the information effectively to avoid future deforestation and\nforest degradation associated with roads, which is still mostly undetectable.\u201d\n\nEchoing Souza\u2019s confidence in new technologies, the study authors underscore\nthe need for a globally applicable automated road-detection system. They\nestimate it would take roughly 640,000 human-hours to conduct a global-scale\nanalysis of road networks using satellite images alone \u2014 far too long a\nprocess to keep pace with the rate at which ghost roads are expanding.\n\nIn a separate study published in early 2024, several of the same researchers\ndetailed how they used their volunteer data from satellite maps to train an AI\nmodel that can pick out the roads within them with an accuracy of up to 81%.\n\n\u201cIn practical terms, such an automated system is one of the most urgent\nconservation needs for tropical forests today,\u201d the study says. \u201cNothing else\nwill keep pace with the contemporary avalanche of proliferating roads.\u201d\n\nCarolyn Cowan is a staff writer for Mongabay.
