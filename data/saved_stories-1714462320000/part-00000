Zilog has called\ntime on the Z80 CPU. Readers may have owned one in an 8-bit microcomputer or\nshowered coins on one in an early arcade video game.\n\n## Zilog to end standalone sales of the legendary Z80 CPU\n\nREAD MORE\n\nIt was ubiquitous in the early to mid-'80s and popular well into the '90s. All\nthis is well known to vintage tech heads, but it deserves more than nostalgic\nmemories. It marked the beginning of the great trends that defined the\nindustry into the 21st century, and in one key attribute changed the lives of\nuncountable hordes of users, including yours truly.\n\nThe Z80 succeeded because it was the first mainstream microprocessor to care\nabout compatibility. There were many companies making CPUs when the Z80\narrived, and none were compatible with their competition. A new platform\nneeded new software, and if it didn't get it, it died.\n\nThe Z80, however, was compatible with a rival, Intel 8080. Both supported the\nearly CP/M operating system, which had the majority of the business\napplications of the time, at least outside the Apple ecosystem, and unlike\nApple, CP/M's creator Digital Research would license its products to anyone.\nThe Z80 wasn't just 8080 code compatible, it was easier to design a computer\naround. It eliminated the need for extra circuitry to control dynamic RAM\nchips, it only needed a single power supply voltage whereas the 8080 needed\nthree, and it had additional instructions to simplify common software\nfunctions. Most chip companies at the time assumed their products were good\nenough to establish their own niche; the Z80 was designed to be attractive to\nthe existing market and grow from there.\n\nThe main gamechanger, though, was that it became very cheap. That wasn't the\ncase early on, when it cost around $60 compared to the 6502's $25, but by the\n1980s, a host of other companies, mostly in Japan, were making their own Z80s\nfor their own business computers. That and four cycles of Moore's Law cut the\nprice to the point where a complete new Z80-based computer could be bought in\nthe UK for \u00a350. Not far off the price of just the chip four years earlier.\n\nThis was the point that the Z80 entered my life, as part of the self-assembly\nSinclair ZX81 kit. Home computing was too expensive before then for many,\nespecially with competing demands from high-ticket household items like color\nTVs and VCRs. Dropping hundreds if not thousands on a personal computer was\nout of the question for millions. The Z80 changed all that - its suitability\nfor a minimalist design coupled with its own low cost gave it a market at the\nvery bottom that no other CPU could meet. There was no 6502-powered equivalent\nof the ZX81.\n\nThe chip democratized IT for a generation, including mine, and fired our\nimaginations. Life at the bottom wasn't pretty \u2013 a 1K tape-based monochrome\nmachine with no lower case, sound or graphics doesn't look like much. But\ncompared to no computer at all, it was magnificent. That simplicity meant huge\nbenefits in learning the machine code at the heart of the computer in place of\nthe built-in BASIC interpreter. That meant learning about memory maps, stacks,\nclock timing and clean code \u2013 skills still invaluable in cybersecurity today.\nMany thousands taught themselves those in their bedrooms, and many of those\nbecame the bedrock of IT thereafter.\n\nZilog never repeated the success of the Z80. Once IBM picked the combination\nof Intel's 16-bit 8086 family and MS-DOS while allowing Microsoft to license\nit freely, the same mix of compatibility that fired up the Z80 took over at\nits expense. The successor Z8000 had virtually no sales, and the Z80 lived on\nas an embedded controller quietly ticking away unseen in miscellaneous\nelectronics. Now, it is gone.\n\n  * Open source versus Microsoft: The new rebellion begins\n  * Apple's GoFetch silicon security fail was down to an obsession with speed\n  * Intel's PC chip ship is sinking with Arm-ada on the horizon\n  * China's 7nm chip surprise reveals more than Beijing might like\n  * 114 billion transistors, one big meh. Apple's M1 Ultra wake-up call\n\nOnly it isn't entirely. As well as a ghostly presence in hundreds of emulators\nand an untold acreage of attics where teenage possessions are stored, you can\nmake your own in an FPGA logic chip. The original only had 8500 transistors,\nwhich means you can find nearly half a billion on Cerebra's four trillion\ntransistor behemoth device. It's as simple as a bicycle in the age of self-\ndriving cars. It will be studied, recreated and used far into the future.\n\nWhat can never be recreated is the time when it brought the knowledge of\ncomputing to those desperate to learn. Even conscious efforts to bring basic\neducational computing to the masses such as the Raspberry Pi are, to some, as\ncomplex and unfathomable as any modern desktop PC. That's fine \u2013 nobody wants\nto go back to the days of building your own TV from an article in Practical\nTelevision magazine.\n\nStill, something important has been lost, a chapter closed in the history of\nour defining technology. Goodbye, little chip. You will not be forgotten. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Intel\n  * Microprocessor\n  * Retro computing\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Intel\n  * Microprocessor\n  * Retro computing\n  * Zilog\n  * ZX Spectrum\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Alder Lake\n  * AVR\n  * AWS Graviton\n  * Mobileye\n  * Pat Gelsinger\n  * Trusted Platform Module\n  * vPro\n  * x86\n  * Xen\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Computer\n  * FPGA\n  * PC\n  * Software\n\n#### More about\n\n50 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Intel\n  * Microprocessor\n  * Retro computing\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Intel\n  * Microprocessor\n  * Retro computing\n  * Zilog\n  * ZX Spectrum\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Alder Lake\n  * AVR\n  * AWS Graviton\n  * Mobileye\n  * Pat Gelsinger\n  * Trusted Platform Module\n  * vPro\n  * x86\n  * Xen\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Computer\n  * FPGA\n  * PC\n  * Software\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Intel's effort to build a foundry biz is costing far more \u2013 and taking\nlonger \u2013 than expected\n\nAnalysis If you wanna make money you've gotta spend money.
