And rent is becoming\nless affordable fastest for households with children. In a world where so many\nproducts are getting more affordable for consumers over time, housing in the\nmost productive parts of the country isn\u2019t following the same pattern.\n\nA great irony of U.S. housing policy is that regulations that are causing\nworsening affordability problems for families, such as single-family zoning,\nwere once touted as a path to abundance of the type of housing best for\nchildren. To make housing more affordable, the government must loosen its grip\non what type of housing is built. Freeing homebuilders to serve a wider\nvariety of households at a broad range of incomes is the path to abundant\nhousing. And in the process, we might find that less rigidly planned\nneighborhoods have benefits for children that extend beyond housing\naffordability.\n\n###\n\nA Brief History of U.S. Single-Family Zoning\n\nPrior to the 20th century, the form of U.S. urban development was lightly\nregulated. In cities, rules intended to promote safety and minimize fire\ndamage limited wood construction for attached structures. Tenement laws set\ncertain requirements for light and safety. In some cities, unconstitutional\nlaws segregated neighborhoods by race. But the use and size of buildings was\ngenerally left to private actors to determine.\n\nIn 1913, the Supreme Court overturned local rules that zoned land by race.\nLocal policymakers looking for a way to segregate their cities by income\u2014and\nrace indirectly\u2014turned to zoning rules as a way to set high minimum prices for\nhouses in certain neighborhoods. This policy change coincided with Progressive\nEra activism for much more government involvement in economic planning. From\nthe earliest days of zoning, limiting development exclusively to detached\nsingle-family houses on large land parcels was a cornerstone of the policy.\n\nZoning was framed as a way to create housing that would be appropriate for\nfamilies. In its justification for adopting the country\u2019s first complete\nzoning ordinance in 1916, the New York City Board of Estimate and\nApportionment explained:\n\n> In the crowded tenement districts having stores on the ground floor, the\n> roads are congested with vehicular and push carts and the sidewalks with\n> business encroachments and pedestrians. There is absolutely no place for the\n> child to exercise natural play instincts. Play is as necessary to the child\n> as food and clothing. It is the thwarting of the boy\u2019s craving for play that\n> leads to a large proportion of the juvenile delinquency that comes before\n> the Children\u2019s Court.\n\nCity officials left unspoken that many children\u2019s parents couldn\u2019t afford low-\ndensity housing. At the time, many legal experts doubted that it was\nconstitutional to limit landowners\u2019 rights to develop their property without\ncompensating them for the resulting reduction in their property value as the\nNew York City zoning ordinance did. But in its landmark 1926 decision Euclid\nv. Ambler, the Supreme Court upheld zoning with a justification based in part\non its supposed benefits for child-rearing:\n\n> The coming of one apartment house is followed by others, interfering by\n> their height and bulk with the free circulation of air and monopolizing the\n> rays of the sun which otherwise would fall upon the smaller homes, and\n> bringing, as their necessary accompaniments, the disturbing noises incident\n> to increased traffic and business, and the occupation, by means of moving\n> and parked automobiles, of larger portions of the streets, thus detracting\n> from their safety and depriving children of the privilege of quiet and open\n> spaces for play, enjoyed by those in more favored localities\u2014until, finally,\n> the residential character of the neighborhood and its desirability as a\n> place of detached residences are utterly destroyed.\n\nMore recently, in the 1970s the Supreme Court upheld local restrictions on\nunrelated people living together using a similar justification:\n\n> The police power is not confined to elimination of filth, stench, and\n> unhealthy places. It is ample to lay out zones where family values, youth\n> values, and the blessing of quiet seclusion and clean air make the area a\n> sanctuary for people.\n\nWhile U.S. policy generally prioritizes economic freedom more than other\ndeveloped countries, our land use regulations are markedly stricter than those\nof other countries. Nowhere else on earth mandates the low densities that U.S.\nsingle-family zoning and lot size requirements combine to create in urban\nareas. In her book \u201cZoned in the USA,\u201d Sonia Hirt explains that in the case of\nsingle-family zoning, Americans\u2019 spatial individualism trumps their economic\nindividualism.\n\nBy taking away the right to build housing that economizes on land, zoning\nrules limit the amount of housing that can be built and drive up the cost of\nwhat does get built. In 1940, attached single-family housing\u2014townhouses or\nrowhouses\u2014and units in duplexes, triplexes and fourplexes made up nearly a\nquarter of the country\u2019s total housing stock. Today, their share is down to\nabout 13%.\n\nEven in parts of the U.S. where multi-family housing is allowed, meaning that\nhouseholds can economize on land, most new apartment units are small, with two\nbedrooms or fewer. North American building codes indirectly ban family-size\napartments. Multi-family buildings in the U.S. and Canada are required to have\ntwo interior staircases for emergency egress. This leads developers to create\napartment buildings with long corridors that have units on each side. In turn,\nthe apartments only have windows on one side, making it infeasible to build\nlarge units. Many parts of the world allow tall apartment buildings with a\nsingle staircase, making family-size apartments more common and much more\naffordable than they are in the U.S. Moreover, the two-staircase requirement\nis not even leading to good fire safety outcomes; in fact, the U.S. has one of\nthe highest fire death rates in the developed world.\n\nRegulations are not the only factor that make the U.S. housing stock what it\nis. Americans\u2019 relative wealth and abundance of land play a large part in our\nlow-density development. But zoning rules make neighborhoods unresponsive to\nchanging economics. As prices have skyrocketed in the parts of the country\nwhere housing is most scarce, we see a stagnant supply of existing single-\nfamily houses in neighborhoods that would accommodate more households over\ntime if regulations allowed them to evolve.\n\n###\n\nHousing Affordability for Families\n\nAbout one-third of U.S. households rent, a share that has barely budged since\n1965. But the share of income that renters spend on rent has increased\nsteadily since then. This trend is even more pronounced in the country\u2019s most\nproductive places\u2014the Bay Area, Boston, Los Angeles, New York, Seattle and\nWashington, D.C., regions. As of 2019, the median renter household in these\n\u201csuperstar cities\u201d spends 28% of its income on rent, up from 22% in 1980.\n\nFor renter households with children, rent is eating up a larger share of their\nhousehold incomes at an even faster rate: The share of their income that\nrenter households with children spend on rent has increased by 34% since 1980.\nPolicies that were framed as creating an abundance of housing best-suited for\nchild-rearing have led to housing scarcity that perversely affects households\nwith children more than others. The chart below shows rent as a percentage of\nincome for different types of households over time.\n\nBeyond stretching the budgets of households with children, land use\nregulations may even be reducing the number of children born. Research on the\nrelationship between land use restrictions\u2014including rules limiting\ndevelopment to single-family construction\u2014and family size shows that in places\nwith relatively stringent land use restrictions, women have children later in\nlife and have fewer children overall. This correlation likely rings true for\nmany people in high-cost cities who feel they need to spend several years\ndeveloping career stability and a financial cushion before having children.\nRules framed as a tool to create neighborhoods suitable for children are\nleading to fewer of them being born.\n\nIn parts of the country where housing supply constraints have created severe\naffordability problems, some neighborhoods that seem ideal for families on\npaper have become so expensive that households with children are largely\npriced out. Two neighborhoods in Austin, Brentwood and Crestview, were\ndeveloped in the 1950s with zoning rules that activists and the courts\npromoted as kid-friendly policy. Their zoning limits much of their area\nexclusively to single-family houses. Mature trees and sidewalks even make them\npleasant places for walking. But in part because these neighborhoods have\nbecome very expensive, only 17% of the houses in these neighborhoods include\nchildren, compared to 28% of households across the city.\n\nIn the country\u2019s most extreme case of urban housing unaffordability, San\nFrancisco, the share of the population under 18 has shrunk to just 13% as cost\npressures have pushed households with children to places where they can afford\nmore square footage. In San Francisco and other high-cost cities, plenty of\nhousing units with multiple bedrooms are home not to families, but to groups\nof roommates. Due in part to a shortage of apartments, groups of adults rent\nlarger units. These groups can often outbid households with kids since they\ninclude more than one or two wage earners. This dynamic pushes many households\nwith children to parts of the Bay Area where long commutes limit parents\u2019 time\nwith their children, or to other parts of the country with less expensive real\nestate but fewer economic opportunities.\n\n###\n\nChildren and Housing Policy\n\nLocal and federal housing policy has undoubtedly led to moreU.S. housing\ntaking the form of detached single-family homes. For households that\nprioritize this type of housing, its abundance has benefits. But setting aside\nthe issue of affordability, is it even true that detached single-family\nhousing is unambiguously good for the children whose families can afford to\nlive in it?\n\nDetached single-family zoning goes hand in glove with transportation that can\ncarry people long distances quickly. As Kenneth Jackson writes in \u201cCrabgrass\nFrontier: The Suburbanization of American Life\u201d:\n\n> The most important characteristic of the automobile suburb was its lower\n> density and larger average lot size as compared with anything ever\n> previously experienced in an urban world. Because the motor vehicle opened\n> up much more land than was possible with public transportation, the price of\n> a square foot of real estate was lower in areas accessible only to cars than\n> in neighborhoods served by good transit.\n\nAbout 20% of Americans are too young to drive. For them, living in a house\nwith its own yard in a neighborhood of similar houses often means relying on\ntheir parents\u2019 cars to get to parks, schools, retail establishments and other\nchildren\u2019s houses. To counteract these limitations, some parents are beginning\nto intentionally create opportunities for their children to have more freedom\nand independence.\n\nLenore Skenazy, author of the book \u201cFree-Range Kids,\u201d chronicles and advocates\nfor this trend. It\u2019s probably no coincidence that she developed her philosophy\nas she raised her own kids in New York City. Her neighborhood, Jackson\nHeights, has a diverse housing stock including apartment buildings, duplexes\nand townhouses, along with the occasional single-family house. Because this\nhousing stock facilitates high population density, it\u2019s also among the most\nwalkable neighborhoods in the country with many places its children might go\nindependently.\n\nThe decision about what type of neighborhood meets any specific family\u2019s needs\nmust be one that the family makes for itself. But under today\u2019s land use\nrestrictions, the supply of housing in walkable neighborhoods is so\nconstrained that people must pay a high premium to live in them. Liberalizing\nrules to allow more types of development in well-located neighborhoods would\nopen opportunities for more families to live at a level of density that best\nmeets their own needs.\n\n###\n\nAn Abundance Agenda for Housing Families\n\nMandating large-lot detached housing development has certainly shifted\nresources in housing production away from apartments, toward the type of\nhousing policymakers have said is good for children. But paradoxically, under\nthe scarcity caused by zoning rules, households with children are experiencing\nworsening housing affordability compared with others. Reversing this\nartificial scarcity requires making it easier to build housing of all types.\n\nAllowing apartments to be built in more places would reduce families\u2019\ncompetition for large units by creating opportunities for more people to rent\ntheir own apartments rather than sharing large units with roommates.\nLegalizing more housing for families in neighborhoods close to job centers\nrequires building code reform that allows for taller single-stair buildings,\nwhich would encourage family-size multi-family housing.\n\nThis would create opportunities for more of the families that want to live in\nwalkable urban neighborhoods to do so. Examples from Austria to Seoul show\nthat family-oriented apartments are possible when building codes allow large\nunits.\n\nMinimum lot size reform in Houston offers an instructive model for a reform\nthat has facilitated family-size housing construction. In 1998, the city began\na process of reducing its minimum lot size requirement from 5,000 square feet\ndown to 1,400 square feet, leading to the construction of tens of thousands of\ntownhouses and detached single-family houses on small lots.\n\nThis construction has taken place all over the city, but it\u2019s concentrated in\nneighborhoods such as Montrose and Rice Military that are close to job\ncenters. One estimate of the effects of this reform finds that allowing\nhousing to be built on smaller lots benefits the typical Houston household by\n$18,000 over their lifetime.\n\nLiberalizing land use regulations is not just a matter of dollars and cents.\nAllowing more and lower-cost housing to be built means that families can stay\nin their communities even as demand for housing increases. It would allow more\nparents to have shorter commutes, freeing more time to spend with their kids.\nAnd more families would have the choice to live in neighborhoods where their\nkids can have the type of independence and mobility that urban living allows.\n\n### Subscribe to Discourse\n\nLaunched a year ago\n\nWhere Ideas Meet.
