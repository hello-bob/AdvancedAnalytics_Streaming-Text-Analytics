Page 1 of 6. 20 Comments.\n\nWith the Framework 16 laptop one of the performance pieces I've been meaning\nto carry out has been seeing out Linux performs against Microsoft Windows 11\nfor this AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS powered modular/upgradeable laptop. Recently\ngetting around to it in my benchmarking queue, I also compared the performance\nof Ubuntu 23.10 to the near final Ubuntu 24.04 LTS on this laptop up against a\nfully-updated Microsoft Windows 11 installation.\n\nThe Framework 16 review unit as a reminder was configured with the 8-core /\n16-thread AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS Zen 4 SoC with Radeon RX 7700S graphics, a 512GB\nSN810 NVMe SSD, MediaTek MT7922 WiFi, and a 2560 x 1600 display.\n\nIn the few months of testing out the Framework 16 predominantly under Linux\nit's been working out very well. With also having a Windows 11 partition as\nshipped by Framework, after updating that install it made for an interesting\ncomparison against the Ubuntu 23.10 and Ubuntu 24.04 performance.\n\nThe same Framework 16 AMD laptop was used throughout all of the testing for\nlooking at the out-of-the-box performance across Microsoft Windows 11, Ubuntu\n23.10, and the near-final state of Ubuntu 24.04.\n\n20 Comments - Next Page\n\nPage: 1 2 3 4 5 6 Next Page\n\nRelated Articles\n\nIntel's Linux Software Optimizations Continue Paying Off Big Time For Xeon\nEmerald Rapids\n\nAmpere Altra Max Performance For Ubuntu Linux 22.04 vs. 23.10 vs. 24.04\n\nUbuntu 24.04 Helping Achieve Greater Performance On Intel Xeon Scalable\nEmerald Rapids\n\nCentOS Stream ISA Optimized Packages Show Great Results On Intel Xeon Emerald\nRapids\n\nArch Linux CachyOS Benchmarks Of x86-64-v3 & x86-64-v4 Repositories\n\nBenchmarking The Experimental Ubuntu x86-64-v3 Build For Greater Performance\nOn Modern CPUs\n\nLatest Linux News\n\nFedora Linux 40 Cleared For Release Next Week\n\nRust-Written LAVD Kernel Scheduler Shows Promising Results For Linux Gaming\n\nIntel Preps Adaptive Sync SDP, Lunar Lake Display & More DG2 PCI IDs In Linux\n6.10\n\nAutodafe 0.2 Released For Freeing Your Project From Autotools\n\nGTK4 Continues Improving Graphics Offload & DMA-BUF Integration\n\nRocky Linux To Support Upstream Stable Kernels\n\nSystem76's COSMIC Working On Drag & Drop, More Compositor Improvements\n\nMPV 0.38 Media Player Released With New Options & Fixes\n\nWayland Protocols 1.35 Introduces Alpha Modifier Protocol, Tablet-V2 As Stable\n\nLXQt 2.0 Released For Qt6 Desktop Port, Greater Wayland Support\n\nShow Your Support, Go Premium\n\nPhoronix Premium allows ad-free access to the site, multi-page articles on a\nsingle page, and other features while supporting this site's continued\noperations.\n\nLatest Featured Articles\n\nUbuntu 24.04 Boosts Performance, Outperforming Windows 11 On The AMD Ryzen\nFramework 16 Laptop\n\nAMD Announces Ryzen PRO 8840 & PRO 8000G Series CPUs\n\nUbuntu 24.04 Brings Some Performance Gains For AMD Threadripper 7980X /\nSystem76 Thelio Major\n\nIntel Announces Gaudi 3 AI Accelerator, Intel Xeon 6 Brand\n\nAMD Radeon Linux Gaming Performance At Parity Between KDE Plasma 6.0 X11 vs.\nWayland\n\nSupport Phoronix\n\nThe mission at Phoronix since 2004 has centered around enriching the Linux\nhardware experience.
