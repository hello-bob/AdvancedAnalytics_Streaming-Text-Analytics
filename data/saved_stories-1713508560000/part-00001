But\nit also has a different definition of what the news is.\n\n  * Take a look at the national BBC radio schedule on 18 April 1930\n\nThen, it was very dependent on news agencies and official government\nannouncements. Today, less so.\n\nAnd in other changes; back then, announcers were anonymous, and they wore\ndinner jackets to work.\n\nThis was out of respect for the music and drama performers, who had to dress\nup to entertain in the evening.\n\nImage caption,\n\nWireless radio technology was put on display at the London Olympia in 1926\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * How press reacted to snap election call\n\n    * Published\n\n18 April 2017\n\n  * Election campaigning latest\n\n    * Published\n\n18 April 2017\n\n## Related Internet Links\n\n  * BBC News in the 1930s\n\n  * 18 April 1930 - BBC Genome\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\n\n## Top Stories\n\n  * Live.\n\nSecond juror excused from Trump trial days after being sworn in\n\n  * Kenya's military chief dies in helicopter crash\n\n    * Published\n\n3 minutes ago\n\n  * Dubai airport delays persist after UAE storm\n\n    * Published\n\n1 hour ago\n\n## Features\n\n  * 'Apocalyptic' Dubai floods shake picture-perfect city\n\n  * The West says China makes too much.
