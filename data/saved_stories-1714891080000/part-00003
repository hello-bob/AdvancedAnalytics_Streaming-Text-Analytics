Occasionally, this gargantuan\nsilhouette is accompanied by what the Germans call a Heiligenschein, a halo-\nlike glow about the periphery of the darkness; sometimes, the whipping wind\nmoves the clouds so quickly that these giant penumbras appear as if they\u2019re\nswiftly creeping along the rocky hillside. An eerie, disquieting, unearthly\nimage, explicable as an optical illusion and yet for centuries an ominous and\nmenacing visage across th/e snow and fog-covered Harz Mountains.\n\n\u201cAnd art thou nothing?\u201d asked Samuel Taylor Coleridge in a poem of 1828, these\nvisions at \u201cwintry dawn, where o\u2019er the sheep-track\u2019s maze / The viewless\nsnow-mist weaves a glist\u2019ning haze... gliding without tread, / An image with a\nglory round its head.\u201d For Romantics like Coleridge, the so-called specter was\nan example of nature\u2019s sublimity, whether experienced in the Scottish\nHighlands or the Harz, but only the German mountain in that later chain has\nits name affixed to the phenomenon. That\u2019s because long before the Romantics\nthis peak had certain associations about it. \u201cThere is a mountain very high\nand bare,\u201d writes the linguist and folklorist Jacob Grimm, \u201cwhereon it is\ngiven out that witches hold their dance.\u201d\n\nIn honor of Walpurgisnacht, as the evening of April 30 is known, the hamlets\nof Saxony-Anhalt do a brisk spring-time tourist trade selling beer steins\ndecorated with broomstick-riding witches and felt dolls of wizened crones,\nthough the celebration has long had a more solemn purpose. Back when the\nseasons of the year were as a liturgy\u2014when there still were reliable seasons\nof the year\u2014Walpurgisnacht was among the \u201crites focused on driving back\ndarkness and cold in early spring and on rebirth and reopening,\u201d as Ronald\nHutton explains in Queens of the Wild: Pagan Goddesses in Christian Europe.\nEven today, Walpurgisnacht is marked throughout Europe; in Sweden, Finland,\nLithuania, and Estonia, Czechia, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Austria, and even as\nfar west as the Netherlands. Regardless of its widespread observance,\nfeaturing bonfires and the ringing of church bells from Ljubljana and\nStockholm to Amsterdam and Bratislava, Brocken remains the naval where that\ncosmic umbilical cord connects the material realm to the spiritual. Describing\nthe legends that go back long before Christianity came to the valleys between\nthe Wesser and Elbe Rivers, Grimm writes in his 1835 Teutonic Mythology that\nat Brocken, \u201cOur forefathers kept the beginning of May as a great festival,\nand it is still regarded as the trysting time of witches.\u201d\n\nGrimm was probably right that ancient Teutons recognized this astrologically\nauspicious date (as the Celts did with their celebration of Beltane) for there\nis a reason why May 1 was made a saint\u2019s day in honor of the eighth-century\nAnglo-Saxon nun and missionary to the Franks named Saint Walpurga. Patron of\nthose suffering from rabies and whooping cough, Saint Walpurga was most\nassociated with driving witches out of her parish, and as a result she was\nintegral in the Church-sanctioned campaign against witchcraft. Lighting fires\nand ringing bells were now repurposed against the witches, all on the day\nbefore Walpurga is to be honored, when it was understood that supernatural\nforces were at their strongest during this period of sunny days and chilly\nnights. With the characteristic irony that attended the often-forced\nconversion of so-called pagans, it should be mentioned that there was an\nancient spring fertility goddess, Walburga, who had once been venerated on\nthis very date. Now, rather than Walburga chasing away the winter, April 30\nwould be dedicated to Walpurga chasing out the witches. But this day has\nalways been defined by ambiguity and confusion, where it\u2019s easy to mistake\nyour own shadow for a ghost.\n\nFrancisco Goya, Witches\u2019 Sabbath (1798)\n\nWalpurgisnacht\u2014halfway between the vernal equinox and the estival solstice, on\nthe exact opposite side of the year from Halloween\u2014is still a gloaming time\nwhen the membrane between the here and the hereafter is more porous, a\ntwilight hour of the calendar when the supernatural can enter our world.\n\u201cWalpurgis Night.... when the graves were opened and the dead came forth and\nwalked,\u201d writes Bram Stoker in his less-read 1914 follow-up Dracula\u2019s Guest.\n\u201cWhen all evil things of earth and air and water held revel\u201d\u2014and if not evil,\nthen alien, strange, and beautiful. In the transition of winter into spring,\nas snow melts into the soggy earth and green-fields are dappled in showers,\nthere is a powerful liminality, a sense of the vagaries of nature shifting\nfrom freezing to warmth, of the capricious personality of our environment that\ndeigns to let us live amidst it for a time. Of something bigger than\nus\u2014something deserving of veneration, if not sacrifice.\n\nBecause Brocken is nearly 4,000 feet tall, and thus closer to Asgard, or the\nastral realm, or heaven, or what-have-you, there is an intuitive sense that it\nwould be the place where spirits should return as the light follows that\ndarkest of midnights. Location alone isn\u2019t what has solidified the mountain in\nthe imagination as the meeting place of Walpurgisnacht covens, however, for\nboth the peak and the holiday have appeared in poetry and prose by Heinrich\nHeine, Mikhail Bulgakov, Thomas Mann, and so on. But if Brocken endures with\ninfernal associations, it\u2019s in large part due to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.\n\n\u201cWe, it seems, have entered newly / In the sphere of dreams enchanted,\u201d says\nthe notorious necromancer Dr. Faust to the demon Mephistopheles; the latter\nhas sold his soul to the former in exchange for the full power and depth of\nexperience. As I explain in my new book, Devil\u2019s Contract: The History of the\nFaustian Bargain, Goethe\u2019s closet drama \u201cfuses the micro and the micro, the\ncosmological and the quantum, into a single unity [...] much more is at stake\nthan the soul of a mere man. For Goethe\u2019s Faust, the ultimate purpose isn\u2019t to\nelevate himself above our physical world, but rather to fuse with it, to\nbecome its incomparable master,\u201d to espy the kingdoms of this planet from that\nhighest peak.\n\nPublished in two parts in 1808 and 1832, respectively, Goethe\u2019s Faust is the\nconsummate work of German Romanticism, and by far the most influential telling\nof the notorious legend in which a soul is bartered to the Devil. In \u201cPart\nOne\u201d of Goethe\u2019s poem, Mephistopheles takes his charge to \u201cthe vast, desert\nplaces,\u201d the peak of Brocken on Walpurgisnacht. On their ascent up the\nmountain, the two encounter a variety of Satan\u2019s penitents, culminating in a\ncoven of witches that includes the ancient Canaanite Succubae Lilith, Adam\u2019s\nfirst wife. Faust licentiously dances with the beautiful demoness, all while\npining for his beloved, but tragically dead, Gretchen. For a minute Faust\nthinks he sees Gretchen among the worshipers, only to learn that this is\nanother cruel trick of illusion as fanciful as the will-o\u2019-the-wisps which led\nhim to the peak. A peak of heartbreak and tragedy, but paradoxically also of\nregeneration and even creation, where flux and chaos have their own potential,\neven if such possibilities are largely depicted as ominous.\n\nKarl Gustav, Faust in the Mountains (1821)\n\n\u201cTell me, if we still are standing, / Or if further we\u2019re ascending?\u201d Faust\nasks Mephistopheles, for \u201cAll is turning, whirling, blending, / Trees and\nrocks with grinning faces, / Wandering lights that spin in mazes, / Still\nincreasing and expanding!\u201d For all of that dialogue with his demon, then,\nthere is a remarkable painting of 1828 by Carl Gustav Carus, rendered two\ndecades after his friend Goethe finished the first part of Faust and four\nbefore he completed the second, in which he imagines the eponymous wizard\nsetting out on his hike up Brocken. Faust in the Mountains, now displayed at\nthe Staatliche Kunstsammlungen in Dresden, depicts its subject in a wizardly\ngreen robe and Renaissance cap, looking forlornly toward the craggy earth as\nhe begins to make his way through the forest just starting to bloom, a\nmurderous pink moon rising over the distant green pine trees on the midnight\nhorizon. Most remarkable is what Carus has deigned to not depict:\nMephistopheles. This Faust is on a lonely sojourn, raising a possibility that\nlike the specters named for Brocken, all of his associates\u2014Mephistopheles,\nLilith, the witches\u2014are but figments of the mind, a far more terrifying place\nthan anything to be found upon the mountain.\n\nWalpurgisnacht is virtually unknown in the United States; this is unfortunate,\nand not just because spring deserves its own Halloween. In a culture permeated\nwith violence but in denial about it, where all manners of evil exist\u2014casual\ncruelty, rank oppression, ecological devastation\u2014any reminder of the demons of\nthis fallen world is important. But Walpurgisnacht was never just about\nwitches\u2019 covens and Black Masses, or about rightly genuflecting before\nunconquerable darkness lest it extinguish the light. The holiday also concerns\nthe occult power of creation, of being able to conjure chimeras out of the\nether, of visions from the chaos. Winifried Hodge Rose writes in her essay\n\u201cWalburga and the Rites of May\u201d that this is a \u201ctime for looking into that\nwhich is coming into being and which should be, for seeking deep roots of\nlife-knowledge and life-mysteries, for love-magic and spells of growth and\nchange, conception and birth.\u201d\n\nIn the permeable dusk of Walpurgisnacht, these are powerful forces, a reminder\nthat creation and imagination need not be the preserve of an elite, of a\npriesthood of artists and writers and musicians, but that they are a\nbirthright to all humanity. Creation and imagination\u2014to see that which is\nnormally invisible, to conceive of that which does not yet exist\u2014is the most\npotent spell, the most powerful form of resistance. It\u2019s no wonder\ninquisitions were launched against witches\u2014and, in turn, against women,\nagainst nature, against the vital spark of self-creation. As Silvia Federici\nwrites in Witches, Witch-Hunting, and Women, \u201cthe witch hunt stands at a\ncrossroad of a cluster of social processes that paved the way for the rise of\nthe modern capitalist worlds.\u201d So then, against the Church and its\nmissionaries, as well as capitalism and its industrialists, Walpurgisnacht can\nremain as a tool of revolution, true to that word\u2019s implication of a\nreturning.\n\nIncidentally, Faust wasn\u2019t the first time that Goethe ruminated on April 30.\nHis 1799 ballad \u201cThe First Walpurgisnacht\u201d (later set to music by Felix\nMendelsohn) conceives of this witches\u2019 carnival in an entirely a more\nliberatory manner than he does in Faustus. A synod of Druids assemble atop\nBrocken on what\u2019s the eve of the first celebration, and thus also of\nChristianity\u2019s dominance over the supernatural realm. For the druids, this is\nnot an issue of worshiping the Devil, but of reverencing \u201cSweet smiles the\nMay! / The forest gay / From frost and ice is freed; / No show is now, / Glad\nsounds resound / Across the verdant mead.\u201d As these people have done for\ncenturies immemorial, they have honored the arrival of spring on this day, but\nnow with the arrival of Christianity, with the staidness of Walpurga\u2019s rituals\nand relics, women and men are to be separated from the earth, from the seasons\nand their cycles. This was a tragedy. It continues to be a tragedy.\n\nAnd yet as the cool of the pagans\u2019 April 30 evening should turn into the dawn\nof the Christians\u2019 May 1, with the eyelids of morning raising upon this newer,\nlesser enchanted world, the druids promise that Walpurga shall not have wholly\nexorcized her sister Walburga. \u201cAs from the smoke is free the blaze, / So let\nour faith burn bright!\u201d concludes a chorus of druids, \u201cAnd if they crush our\nolden ways, / Whoe\u2019er can crush Thy light?\u201d\n\nTwitterShare\n\nThe Millions' future depends on your support.
