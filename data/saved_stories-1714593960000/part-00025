It is also characterized by a unique\nfeature. While the majority of players are Black,^Footnote 1 most fans in the\nstands, a majority of coaches and front-office executives, as well as most\nteam owners, are not Black. This has historically led to cleavages between\nplayers and supporters, as well as to episodes of open racism on the court.\nVivid recent examples of racially motivated hostility include a New York\nKnicks fan spitting on the Atlanta Hawks star Trae Young in Madison Square\nGarden during the second game of a playoff series in 2021. Such episodes are\nfar from isolated, as documented by numerous media accounts. They are but the\nmost visible result of racial divides that run deep in the sport, as in US\nsociety more broadly (Pew Research Center 2016).\n\nWhile such episodes have often made the headlines and fostered a heated\ndebate, a careful analysis of how the pressure from predominantly non-Black\nfans affects predominantly Black players, and in turn the overall quality of\nthe game, has never been conducted. We fill this knowledge gap using a natural\nexperiment generated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Between July 30th and October\n11th, 2020, NBA games were played behind closed doors without fans in the\nstands in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. This led to the creation\nof the so-called NBA Bubble, a controlled environment where players were\nisolated from the outside world and could avoid being infected. This provides\na unique natural experiment to study the question of interest. To this end, we\nobtain data from August 17th to October 11th, 2020, when playoff games took\nplace inside the Bubble, and compare the performance of Black vs. White\nplayers with the 2019 playoffs. Crucially, we have objective and comprehensive\nmetrics of performance for every single NBA player in every game.\n\nWe find that the performance of Black players improved significantly in the\nBubble relative to the performance of White players. Specifically, we estimate\nthat the performance of Black players improved by 27% of the average\nperformance in the pre-Bubble period relative to the performance of White\nplayers. We also find that the negative effect of playing with fans prior to\nthe Bubble was strongest among top players (those in the top 50% of the pre-\nBubble performance distribution), consistent with the hypothesis that top\nplayers are targeted the most by crowds. As these players contribute the most\nto the quality of the game and, in turn, to the profits of the league, this\nimplies that racist pressures cause significant damage to the NBA.\n\nThis study makes an important contribution to the large literature documenting\nracial discrimination in the labor market (Bayer and Charles 2018; Lang and\nSpitzer 2020; Aizer et al. 2020; Caselli and Falco 2021; Blair and Chung\n2022). We extend this body of knowledge by providing new evidence on the\nimpact of negative encouragement in the form of racial pressure on worker\nperformance. The existing literature in the fields of labor economics,\nbehavioral economics, and management on the topic is still scant. While\nnumerous studies document existing racial labor-market gaps in a range of\ncontexts (e.g., Lang and Manove 2011; Kline et al. 2022), little is known\nabout how racist pressures can directly affect performance and contribute to\ncreating those gaps in the first place. The natural experiment we exploit\noffers a unique opportunity and, although the ideal test would have entailed\nshutting down racist behavior per se (as opposed to the presence of fans\naltogether), our evidence offers strong support for the hypothesis that racial\npressures have large negative impacts on worker performance. Indeed, while we\nacknowledge that the Bubble was a special environment for reasons other than\nthe lack of fans (and we provide robustness checks to address this), it is\nhard to conceive of confounding mechanisms that may have affected Black and\nWhite players differently and driven the sizeable gap we uncover.\n\nWe also contribute to a growing literature documenting the impact of racial\ndiscrimination in sports.^Footnote 2 Existing studies have investigated\nreferee decisions (e.g., Price and Wolfers 2010; Parsons et al. 2011; Gallo et\nal. 2013; Magistro and Wack 2022), coach biases (Schroffel and Magee 2012),\nand racial preferences among fans (Kanazawa and Funk 2001; Foley and Smith\n2007; Burdekin et al. 2005). Crucially, no study to date has offered evidence\nof how racial pressure affects athletes\u2019 performance in any major US sport. As\none of the most prestigious leagues in the country and throughout the world,\nthe NBA is an ideal context for this analysis. We build on existing work by\nCaselli et al. (2023), who use a similar natural experiment induced by\nCOVID-19 to identify the impact of pressure from fans on soccer players of\nAfrican origin playing in Italy. A key difference with respect to Caselli et\nal. (2023) is that Black players in the US are mostly American. This allows us\nto cleanly isolate the effect of race. By contrast, Black players in the\nItalian soccer league are predominantly from outside of Italy. Pure jingoism\nand nationalism on the part of fans may therefore contribute to their worse\nperformance over and above sheer racism. In addition, by looking at the NBA \u2014\na league where Black players are in fact the majority while fans are\npredominantly non-Black \u2014 we show that racial pressure can have an impact even\nwhen the disadvantaged group is a prominent one. By contrast, Black football\nplayers in Italy are a small minority. Despite these differences, the strong\nsimilarities in the overall patterns of results between the NBA and the\nItalian football league lend further strength to our conclusions.\n\n## 2 Racial divides in the NBA\n\nThe NBA is a racially diverse league with a defining feature: the majority of\nplayers are Black while the majority of fans are non-Black. In the period we\nanalyze (2019\u201320), over 75% of players in NBA teams were Black, while only 27%\nof fans identified as Black according to the latest data available (Fig. 1).\nThis stark divide does not represent a source of tension per se, but in a\nsociety where racial cleavages run deep, basketball games have often become an\noutlet for racist sentiments. Such tensions are further exacerbated by the\nfact that basketball courts are the smallest among major league sports\n(football, basketball, soccer, baseball, and ice hockey), allowing fans to be\nvery close to players during games.\n\nFig. 1\n\nBlack Players, non-Black Fans\n\nFull size image\n\nRecent reports by Sports Illustrated, The Ringer, and the NBA itself, offer\ndetailed accounts of racist episodes in NBA games (Selbe 2021; Tynes 2019;\nReynolds 2019). There are also numerous reflections on the issue of racism in\nthe league from major NBA players from different epochs. Bill Russell, one of\nthe greatest players in NBA history, wrote the following in his memoirs as he\nreflected on the atmosphere in the city of Boston, where he played in the\n1950s: \u201cThe city had corrupt, city-hall-crony racists, send-em-back-to-Africa\nracist, and in university areas, phony radical-chic racists (long before they\nappeared in New York)\u201d (Goldstein 2022). A similar view was expressed decades\nlater by Lebron James, the elder statesman of the NBA, and its best player\nsince Michael Jordan. When discussing fan behavior Lebron James called Boston\nfans \u201c...racist as [expletive]\u201d, going on to explain \u201cThey will say anything.\nAnd it\u2019s fine. I mean, [expletive], it\u2019s my life. It\u2019s [expletive] I\u2019ve been\ndealing with my whole life. I don\u2019t mind it. Like, I hear it. Like if I hear\nsomebody close by, I\u2019ll check them real quick. I\u2019ll move on to the game.\nThey\u2019re going to say whatever the [expletive] they want to say...I mean, I got\na beer thrown on me leaving the game. Like, it\u2019s Boston.\u201d (Himmelsbach 2022).\nRussell Westbrook, a two-time NBA most valuable player, said this of Utah in\n2019 when visiting as a player for the Oklahoma City Thunder: \u201cEvery time I\ncome here, it\u2019s a lot of disrespectful things that\u2019s said.\u201d Going on to say\nthat fans in Utah regularly call him \u201cboy\u201d during games and have yelled out\ninsults such as \u201cget down on your knees like you\u2019re used to\u201d (Tynes\n2019).^Footnote 3 In the 2019 season, the Boston Celtics banned a fan for two\nyears for shouting racist language towards an opposing player. After the game,\none of the Celtics\u2019 starting players, Marcus Smart, told the Boston Globe:\n\u201cI\u2019ve dealt with a lot of things, here in my own city, and out of this city,\u201d\nSmart said. \u201cI get it. I\u2019ve seen it. I\u2019m not surprised, and it has to be\nfixed, plain and simple\u201d (Himmelsbach 2019). Another recent incident took\nplace in May 2022. The Phoenix Suns\u2019 Chris Paul confronted Dallas fans in the\nstands for harassing his family and offering them unwanted hugs. Earlier in\nthe same season, a Philadelphia 76ers fan was banned for life from the arena\nfor calling Carmelo Anthony of the Los Angeles Lakers \u201cboy\u201d, yelling \u201cget in\nthe corner boy\u201d and \u201ckeep shooting boy\u201d (Haynes 2022).\n\nThe pressures faced by Black players in the NBA are not limited to fan\nbehavior. There have also been high-profile incidents involving White owners\nbehaving in overtly racist ways. One example that took place in 2014 led to\nDonald Sterling, the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, being banned for life\nby the NBA due to overtly racist comments caught on tape about Magic Johnson,\none of the greatest players in NBA history. In 2022, Robert Sarver, the owner\nof the Phoenix Suns, was fined and banned from the NBA for a year due to\nracist and misogynist behavior that took place over the course of 18 years.\n\n## 3 COVID-19 and the NBA Bubble\n\nOn March 11th, 2020, the NBA shut down all games in response to the global\nspread of COVID-19. As it became clear that the pandemic was not going to end\nquickly, the league faced the possibility of having to cancel the season, and\nso forgo enormous revenue from fan attendance and TV deals. The significant\nfinancial costs of a full shutdown led to the decision by the NBA, in\nagreement with the players, of finishing the season and conducting the post-\nseason playoffs inside an isolated environment without fans in attendance, or\n\u201cbubble\u201d.\n\nAt the end of July 2020, the NBA Bubble officially opened at the Walt Disney\nWorld resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. For the subsequent two-and-a-half\nmonths, all NBA games took place inside the Bubble without fans in the stands.\nTo compensate for the lack of crowds, the NBA played music and fake crowd\nnoise (biased towards the nominal home team) throughout the games. This\nprimarily served the purpose of making the game sound more \u201cnatural\u201d on TV.\nFor the purpose of our study, the Bubble constituted a natural experiment that\neffectively turned off the presence of live crowds at NBA matches. A recent\nbut consolidated literature has used the same approach in different contexts\n(Higgs and Stavness 2021; Scoppa 2021; Gong 2022; Steinfeldt et al. 2022;\nCross and Uhrig 2022; Reade et al. 2022; Caselli et al. 2023).^Footnote 4 The\nNBA Bubble ended with the last game of the playoffs on October 11th, 2020.\n\nOne possible concern with our approach is that the protests that followed the\nkilling of George Floyd took place over the same summer as the NBA bubble. It\nmay be reasonable to assume that these protests had a greater impact on Black\nplayers than White players that were playing inside the bubble, and this may\nbe one of the explanations for our findings. For this to explain our results,\nhowever, the protests should have impacted the performance of Black players\ninside the Bubble positively, relative to White players. Statements from NBA\nplayers suggest the opposite. If anything, the protests were a distraction for\nBlack players and could have contributed negatively to their performance\n(Thompson 2021). Black players at the time explicitly expressed concerns about\nplaying games when they would have preferred to be out protesting (Thompson\n2021). There was also an incident within the Bubble when the entire Milwaukee\nBucks team walked out of a game in protest at police violence in Wisconsin\n(Bontemps and Andrews 2020). As professional basketball is a game of focus as\nmuch as ability, it seems sensible to hypothesize that this type of\ndistraction could have easily impaired the performance of Black players during\nthe Bubble (Thompson 2021). This would work in the opposite direction to our\nfindings rather than constituting a plausible explanation for the detected\npattern. In light of these considerations, our estimated effect may be a\nlower-bound estimate of the actual effect of playing inside the Bubble, since\nthe George Floyd protests may have biased the estimated coefficient downwards.\nWe acknowledge, however, that one should be careful in drawing such a\nconclusion given the speculative nature of this discussion in the absence of\nsolid evidence on the effects of the protests.\n\n## 4 Data and empirical model\n\n### 4.1 Data\n\nFor the purpose of our analysis, we construct a rich dataset combining several\nsources of information. The main challenge is to obtain a reliable and\nobjective metric of players\u2019 performance that is not subject to potential bias\nin measurement.^Footnote 5 In addition, our analysis requires detailed\ninformation on players\u2019 characteristics and positions (that is, center,\nforward, and guard, and combinations thereof), in order to test for potential\nconfounding factors.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, we rely on rich data from Stathead (2022), which\nis itself based on data provided by SportRadar, the official statistics\npartner of the NBA. This data uses the modern box score to provide information\non all players\u2019 main characteristics and statistics, e.g., age, position,\npoints, minutes played, field goals, free throws, offensive and defensive\nrebounds, assists, steals, blocks, personal fouls, and turnovers. Based on\nthis very rich data, Stathead (2022) calculates the Game Score (GS), which is\nour objective metric of players\u2019 performance.^Footnote 6 In sum, GS gives a\nmeasure of a player\u2019s productivity over an entire game by aggregating a\nplayer\u2019s positive accomplishments and subtracting the negative\naccomplishments. It is worth noting that the scale of the variable is\ncomparable to that of points scored during a game, that is, 40 tends to be an\noutstanding performance, while 10 is an average performance. The variable can\nalso take negative values for very poor performances. This is not the first\nstudy using this performance metric (Berri et al. 2011). We are the first,\nhowever, to use GS for the purpose of investigating racial discrimination in\nthe NBA.^Footnote 7\n\nIn addition to players\u2019 performance, Stathead (2022) provides general\ninformation on the game: home team, score by quarter, whether the game is part\nof the regular season or the playoffs, and the date of the game. We use the\ndate of games to construct Bubble, a dummy variable equal to one if the game\nwas played during the NBA Bubble. Finally, we obtain data on players\u2019 race and\nnationality from Interbasket (2020), based on information provided by the NBA.\n\nIn the interest of full comparability, we focus on the post-season playoff\ngames, which took place entirely inside the bubble, and compare them with\nplayoff games from the previous year.^Footnote 8 Since playoff games are the\nmost important games of the year, this has the added advantage of focusing on\nhigher-stake settings, where pressure from fans is most likely to play a\nrole.^Footnote 9\n\nOur dataset spans 165 games over two playoff seasons (2019 and 2020). Overall,\n19 teams take part in the two playoffs (but only 13 teams play in both\nplayoffs) and 101 players appear in at least two games of each year analyzed.\nWe drop players who appear in only one or no games in one of the two seasons\nas such cases do not lend themselves to a robust within-player analysis that\ncontrols effectively for individual fixed effects.^Footnote 10 Table 1 shows\nthe characteristics of the sample. Black players constitute about 80% of all\nthe observations in our sample (the share is very similar in the pre-Bubble\nand in the Bubble period).^Footnote 11 The average player in our sample is 28\nyears old during the 2019 playoffs. Average performance, as captured by the\nplayer Game Score (GS) was 9.4 before the Bubble and declined to 9.2 inside\nthe Bubble. This slight drop is consistent with the fact that being in the\nBubble was challenging for players. Through an econometric model, we will show\nthat this minor average decline conceals very different effects for Black and\nWhite players.\n\nTable 1 Descriptive statistics\n\nFull size table\n\n### 4.2 Empirical model\n\nOur main results are based on the estimation of the following empirical model:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} GS_{itg} = \\alpha + \\beta Bubble_g + \\gamma Bubble_g \\times\nBlack_{it} + \\zeta X_{itg} + \\delta _{i} + \\eta _{tg} + u_{itg},\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\n(1)\n\nwhere GS is the Game Score of player i in team t for match g; \\\\(Bubble_g\\\\)\nis a dummy equal to 1 if game g takes place during the Bubble without fans in\nthe stands;^Footnote 12\\\\(Black_{it}\\\\) is a dummy equal to 1 if player i in\nteam t is Black; \\\\(X_{itg}\\\\) is a vector of controls, including a dummy for\nwhether a player is in the starting lineup of a game; \\\\(\\delta _i\\\\) is a\nplayer fixed effect that allows us to control for ability, productivity, and\nany other individual traits that may play a role in the analysis (e.g., age,\nsalary level); \\\\(\\eta _{tg}\\\\) is a combined team-game fixed effect that\ncaptures game-specific characteristics, such as home games and overall\ncharacteristics and performance of a player\u2019s team as well as those of the\nopponent team.^Footnote 13\\\\(u_{itg}\\\\) is an idiosyncratic error term. The\ninclusion of all these fixed effects implies that our coefficient of interest,\n\\\\(\\gamma \\\\), identifies the change in the performance of Black players\nrelative to the White players who play in the same team and in the same games.\nThis amounts to controlling for any factors that may vary across teams and\ngames between the two periods, such as referees. Standard errors are clustered\nat the team-game level to take into account potential correlation in the error\nterms between players who play in the same team and in the same game.^Footnote\n14\n\n## 5 Results\n\nIn this section, we discuss our core results and present a set of robustness\ntests to investigate alternatives to racist pressure as potential mechanisms.\n\n### 5.1 Playing without fans improves the performance of Black players\nrelative to White players\n\nOur key result is that playing without fans improved the performance of Black\nplayers relative to White players. The estimates are presented in Table 2. As\nexplained above, the Bubble period captures all the 2020 playoff games, which\ntook place behind closed doors, while the pre-Bubble period captures the 2019\nplayoffs when fans could attend the games. In the first specification (Col.\n1), we estimate a model with player fixed effects but no team nor \\\\(team\n\\times game\\\\) fixed effects. In this case, we find that inside the Bubble the\nperformance of Black players improves by 1.3 Game Score points with respect to\nthe pre-Bubble period relative to White players. This is a large effect, which\ncorresponds to 13.4% of the average score players obtained in the pre-Bubble\nperiod. When we include team fixed effects in the specification (Col. 2), the\nestimated impact grows to 1.9 GS points (20.1% of the pre-Bubble average\nperformance), and its statistical significance increases to the 1% level. When\nwe include \\\\(team \\times game\\\\) fixed effects, the estimated impact of the\nBubble on the performance of Black players relative to White players grows\nfurther (2.5 points, or 26.6% of the pre-Bubble average), and it is\nstatistically significant at the 1% level. Reassuringly, all the\nspecifications we estimate deliver results in a tight range.^Footnote 15 We\nalso run a placebo test where we estimate the change in the performance of\nBlack players relative to White players in regular season games that took\nplace before the Bubble (2019\u201320) compared to regular season games the\nprevious year (2018\u201319). We find no change (Appendix Table A2), which lends\nfurther credibility to the conclusion that our estimated impact is indeed due\nto playing inside the Bubble. In a similar vein, we analyze the playoffs the\nyear after the Bubble (2020\u201321), when fans were back in the stands (Appendix\nTable A3). Consistent with the hypothesis that the Bubble drove our main\nresult, we do not find a significant difference between the performance of\nBlack and White players in the 2020\u201321 playoffs (the post-Bubble year)\nrelative to the 2018\u201319 playoffs (the pre-Bubble year). This also corroborates\nthe conclusion that racial protests following the killing of George Floyd are\nunlikely to explain our results, as discussed in Section 3, since the issue of\npolice brutality continued to be salient after the end of the Bubble.\n\nTable 2 Effect of Bubble (no fans) on players\u2019 performance\n\nFull size table\n\nTo offer some insight into the monetary value of the productivity loss induced\nby racial pressure among Black players, we estimate the relationship between\nplayer salaries and productivity as captured by the Game Score we use in the\nanalysis.^Footnote 16 The results, not shown for conciseness, indicate that\nthe negative effect of playing with fans on Black players relative to White\nplayers is associated with an earning loss per player of 2.58 million US\ndollars a year on average.^Footnote 17 This is a descriptive exercise, but the\nsheer magnitude of the monetary values involved is sufficient to underscore\nthe economic implications of the problem, as discussed further in the next\nsection.\n\nFinally, we acknowledge that the ideal test of our hypothesis would have been\nto \u201cturn off\u201d racist behavior per se as opposed to the presence of fans\naltogether. That source of exogenous variation is not available and would be\nhard to induce. In the absence of such a test, we can check whether our\nresults are consistent with recorded patterns of racist behavior among fans\nprior to the pandemic. Specifically, we can test whether the results are\nstronger when Black players inside the Bubble play against teams whose\nsupporters have been more frequently associated with episodes of racial abuse\nin the past, relative to playing against those teams before the Bubble. Since\na complete record of racial abuse in the NBA is not available, we must rely on\nevidence of racist behavior in the general population and in the\nliterature.^Footnote 18 Namely, we rely on recent work by Stephens-Davidowitz\n(2014), who use large-scale data from Google searches to rank US states by the\nprevalence of racist attitudes. Their results are compelling and have\nattracted the attention of the public (e.g., Ingraham 2015 on The Washington\nPost), but should be treated as suggestive. They show that racist attitudes\nare most prevalent in the Northeast and in the South of the United States. In\nline with this, our analysis shows that the performance of Black players\ninside the Bubble improves the most when they play against teams from the\nNortheast and the South (Appendix Table A4). The Northeast is also a region\nwhere anecdotal evidence suggests that episodes of abuse in NBA games have\nbeen more prominent (Himmelsbach 2019, 2022; Haynes 2022).^Footnote 19\n\nTo probe these findings further, we identify additional proxies for the racist\nattitudes of a team\u2019s fan base and use them to create a triple interaction\nbetween Black, Bubble and the attitudes of the opponent\u2019s team fan base. If\nour proposed mechanism is truly at play, we should find that the estimated\neffect of the Bubble on the performance of Black players is stronger when\nplaying away matches against teams whose fan base has more racist\nattitudes.^Footnote 20 As the first proxy of racist attitudes, we use the\nabove data on Google searches by Stephens-Davidowitz (2014) at the state level\nand we define a dummy equal to one if the opponent team is from a state with a\nhigh prevalence of racist attitudes (top 25%). Second, we use data on the\npercentage of non-Black fans (Silverman 2020) and we define a dummy equal to\none if the opponent team has a high share of non-Black fans (top\n25%).^Footnote 21 Third, we use historical data based on the 1820 Missouri\nCompromise and we define a dummy variable equal to one if the opponent team is\nfrom a slave state (Forbes 2007). In line with our hypothesis, the results\nshow that the positive effect of playing in the Bubble for Black players is\nstronger when looking at away games played against opponent teams (i) from\nstates with a high incidence of racist Google searchers (top 25%), (ii) whose\nfan base is less Black (top 25%), or (iii) from slave states according to the\n1820 Missouri Compromise (Appendix Table A5).\n\n### 5.2 Top players are the most affected by racial pressure\n\nOur second main result is that the average effects described above are driven\nby top Black players, who are the ones who benefit the most from playing\nwithout fans. To rank players, we use wins above replacement (WAR), a\nstatistic that evaluates each athlete relative to a replacement-level player\nwhile holding constant the value of the other players (Silver 2019).^Footnote\n22 This is a known metric of performance in the NBA. When we split the sample\nin half by players\u2019 WAR in the pre-Bubble season (Appendix Table A6), we find\nthat Black players in the top 50% of the pre-Bubble performance distribution\nare the ones whose performance improves the most inside the Bubble relative to\nWhite players.^Footnote 23 Since top players are the ones who generate the\nmost revenue for the league (they are the ones who attract most fans and\nsponsors) and receive the highest salaries (NBA players with above-median\nperformance are paid 17.5 million US dollars a year, on average, which is\nalmost three times as much as players below the median), this implies that\nracist pressures are not only detrimental to the performance and well-being of\nindividual players but they also cause major economic damage to NBA teams by\nhurting the performance of their most valuable players. Furthermore, the fact\nthat top players are the ones most negatively affected by fans suggests that\nthe effects we uncover are unlikely to be the result of sheer faltering under\npressure (as further discussed below). Top players should be, if anything, the\nones who are best equipped to withstand sheer tension from playing before\nlarge crowds. On the contrary, the evidence is consistent with an explanation\nbased on racist pressure, whereby top players are targeted most heavily by\nracist fans seeking to inflict the most damage by affecting the most\nproductive players.\n\n### 5.3 Competing mechanisms\n\nIn this section, we explore a number of mechanisms other than racist pressure\nthat could theoretically lead to the detected change in the performance of\nBlack players vis-\u00e0-vis White players inside the Bubble. The results are\npresented in Table 3.\n\nFirst, recent studies have shown that Black players may be subject to adverse\nbias in the judgment of referees (Price and Wolfers 2010, 2012). Coupled with\nevidence that referees can be affected by crowd pressure (Reade et al. 2022),\nthis may in principle lead Black players to perform better inside the Bubble\nas a result of fairer referee judgment. To shed light on this mechanism, we\nseparately add the number of personal fouls, and the interaction between\nreferee fixed effects and the dummy for playing inside the Bubble.^Footnote 24\nIn particular, since foul calls depend directly on the judgment of referees,\ninvestigating whether the inclusion of this variable changes the results is an\nindirect test of referee bias.^Footnote 25 When we do this, our results are\nunchanged (Table 3, Col. 1 and Col. 2).\n\nTable 3 Effect of Bubble (no fans) on players\u2019 performance, mechanisms\n\nFull size table\n\nSecond, one may hypothesize that the effect we detect is in fact due to Black\nplayers being more likely to play in positions where average performance\nimproved inside the Bubble relative to performance in other positions for\nreasons that were not connected to the absence of fans. For example, since the\nBubble started after a prolonged break in the season due to the initial\nCOVID-19 shutdown, players\u2019 training routines were disrupted and one could\ntheorize that such disruption affected players in different positions\ndifferently (e.g., centers may take longer to get back in shape due to\ntypically larger body size). It may also have affected players differently\ndepending on their prior level of fitness and athleticism. While we have no\nreason to believe that such traits correlate with race, we can test this\nhypothesis for completeness. We begin by testing the effect of adding to the\nmodel an interaction between the Bubble dummy and a player\u2019s position (Table\n3, Col. 3). Next, we test the effect of including the difference between a\nplayer\u2019s average performance in the 2019\u201320 regular season and the 2018\u201319\nregular season as a measure of the degree to which a player was in shape just\nbefore the Bubble relative to the previous year. In both cases, our results\nare unchanged (Table 3, Col. 4).\n\nA related hypothesis is that age may play a role insofar as players\u2019\nperformance falls with aging and given that the Bubble occurred a year after\nthe previous playoff season. If Black players are younger, on average, this\nmay generate the result we observe.^Footnote 26 When we control for the\ninteraction between the Bubble and the age of a player in our regressions, we\nfind no evidence in support of this hypothesis (Table 3, Col. 5).\n\nFourth, COVID-19 was a major source of stress for people throughout the world\nand NBA players were no exception. Among relatively young athletes who faced\nlimited personal health risks from contracting COVID-19, the biggest worries\nmay have been about the health of their relatives back home. To test whether\nsuch worries affected players\u2019 performance, we exploit the fact that many NBA\nplayers are not from the United States (21% of all players in 2019\u201320) and\nCOVID-19 did not spread evenly across the world. Some areas were affected\nearlier and more heavily. Adding players\u2019 country of origin to the estimation\nconstitutes an indirect test of the role that COVID-19 worries may have played\nin driving our results. When we add controls for players\u2019 country of origin\naggregated by macro-regions, the results do not change (Table 3, Col. 6).\n\nFifth, playing inside the Bubble entailed playing in a controlled environment\nwith a set routine and, most notably, without the disruptions that traveling\nfor away games normally entails. While there are no a priori reasons to\nbelieve that Black and White players would be differently affected by such\ndisruptions, we can test for this possibility by investigating whether Black\nplayers performed worse in away games relative to White players before the\nBubble. We find no evidence supporting this hypothesis (Table 3, Col. 7). We\nanalyze performance in the 2019 (pre-Bubble) playoffs and we do not find a\ndifference between Black and White players in away games.^Footnote 27 If the\nBubble impacted performance by increasing concentration and reducing the\ndistractions players encounter on the road, there is no evidence that such an\neffect should have been more prominent among Black players.\n\nFinally, a prominent hypothesis based on a large literature on the pressure\neffects of crowds (so-called choking effects) is that players from different\nbackgrounds may be differently able to withstand pressures from large\naudiences, regardless of racist behavior. While we have no reason to believe\nthat Black basketball players should be less able to deal with pressure, this\nis a theoretical possibility since life experiences that may affect one\u2019s\nsusceptibility to crowd pressure and in turn athletic performance may\ncorrelate with one\u2019s upbringing and family background (Kocher et al. 2012;\nMoore et al. 2018). We conduct several tests to investigate this hypothesis.\nFirst, we attempt to capture high-pressure situations by controlling for\nwhether a match takes place in an arena that had above-median fan attendance\nprior to the COVID-19 lockdown (Table 3, Col. 8). Second, we introduce a\ncontrol for the difference between a player\u2019s average performance in playoff\nand regular season games in the 2018\u201319 (pre-Bubble) season. This difference\ninteracted with the Bubble dummy serves as a control for a player\u2019s ability to\nperform in high-stake situations (the playoffs) relative to low-stake\nsituations (regular season) in normal circumstances before COVID-19 (Table 3,\nCol. 9). None of these control variables affects the results. Third, we\nrestrict our sample to games in which there should be lower pressure on\nindividual players because the final point difference between the two teams is\nlarger than 20 (and a player\u2019s individual actions are unlikely to be pivotal\nin changing the outcome of the game). We find that the performance of Black\nplayers relative to White players improves inside the Bubble even when we\nfocus on games when pressure is lower (Table 3, Col. 10).^Footnote 28\n\n## 6 Conclusions\n\nThis paper shows that playing in the absence of fans as a result of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic significantly improved the performance of Black NBA players\nrelative to White players. The result is particularly compelling because Black\nplayers are the majority in the NBA. They play, however, in front of\npredominantly non-Black audiences and they are employed by predominantly non-\nBlack team owners. Mounting evidence of racist behavior among NBA fans and\nowners is a clear sign of the presence of cleavages reflecting broader\nsocietal tensions. Our analysis provides evidence of the impact of these\nracial divides on player performance, and it strongly resonates with similar\nevidence from other sports (Caselli et al. 2023).\n\nWe also show that the presence of fans is most detrimental for top players,\nwho receive the highest salaries and generate the most revenue for the NBA.\nThis leads to an important conclusion: by lowering players\u2019 performance,\nracist pressures lower the quality of the game and cause economic damage to\nthe NBA. Further work will be necessary to produce precise estimates of these\ncosts, but in a league where the average player has a multi-million dollar\nyearly salary, the loss of productivity we estimate deserves close attention\nfrom NBA executives, who may realize that fighting racism is not only a moral\nimperative, it is also good for business.\n\n## Data availability\n\nThe data used in this article are publicly available (Basketball\nReference/Stathead, InterBasket, ESPN, FiveThirtyEight).\n\n## Notes\n\n  1. For the purpose of our analysis, this includes both Black and mixed-race/Black players.\n\n  2. The literature has also highlighted the importance of diversity for team performance (Glennon et al. 2021) and the impact of supporters on sports results (Pettersson-Lidbom and Priks 2010; Ponzo and Scoppa 2018; Bryson et al. 2021; Colella et al. 2023).\n\n  3. The term \u201cboy\u201d has a racial history dating back to slavery. It has been deemed a racist term by US federal courts, and in certain contexts is legally considered to bear racial animus (Brinkerhoff 2007; Bright 2010).\n\n  4. A defining feature of the NBA Bubble was that players were isolated from the outside world. Despite the NBA investing substantial resources to make the Bubble as comfortable as possible, this may have taken a toll on players. Our results do indeed show a slight drop in average performance inside the Bubble across all players (see the next section). Since all players faced the same restrictions, however, this does not affect our analysis, which looks at the differential impact on Black and White players.\n\n  5. Principe and van Ours (2022), for instance, note that newspaper ratings of professional football players can be subject to racial bias in the context of Italy.\n\n  6. GS was created by John Hollinger, the former Vice President of Basketball Operations for the Memphis Grizzlies of the NBA, former columnist at ESPN, and current Senior NBA columnist at The Athletic. The exact formula for GS is: \\\\(GS = PTS + 0.4 \\times FG - 0.7 * FGA - 0.4 \\times (FTA - FT) + 0.7 \\times ORB + 0.3 \\times DRB + STL + 0.7 \\times AST + 0.7 \\times BLK - 0.4 \\times PF - TOV\\\\), where PTS is points, FG is field goals, FGA is field goal attempts, FT is free throws, FTA is free throw attempts, ORB is offensive rebounds, DRB is defensive rebounds, STL is steals, AST is assists, BLK is blocks, PF is personal fouls and TOV is turnovers. The weights assigned to the different dimensions are routinely used (see, for instance, Berri et al. 2011). While they may appear arbitrary, they do not influence our analysis which holds them constant throughout and compares the same players before and after the creation of the Bubble. In addition, the results are robust to an alternative formula for GS that does not include FG and FGA. This implies that the results are not simply driven by the fact that Black players take more shots. These additional results are available upon request.\n\n  7. John Hollinger has also created an alternative measure of players\u2019 productivity on the field, the Player Efficiency Rating (PER). That measure also takes into account three-point field goals and attempts, and normalizes players\u2019 performance within team and season (Sports Reference 2022). The empirical analysis will show that our results are robust to using this alternative measure.\n\n  8. The alternative would have been to compare a mix of (relatively few) regular season and (all) playoff games that took place inside the Bubble with the entire previous season (regular plus playoffs). This would have been a much more imprecise comparison since the NBA Bubble started at a time when teams had a different number of regular season games left to play before the playoffs. Given the very different stakes of regular season and playoff games, this imbalance would have caused major problems of comparability (Teramoto and Cross 2010; Fromal 2017).\n\n  9. One concern with using data from the playoffs is that, by construction, some teams are exiting the data every round and the persistence of some teams relative to others may not be random. One possible way to correct for this issue is to restrict the sample to the first round, but this would trim the sample significantly, thus affecting the statistical significance of our estimates. Indeed, when we restrict the sample to the first round of the playoffs, we find that our results are qualitatively unchanged but the number of observations drops by half and our statistical power is significantly impaired, preventing us from detecting a significant effect. These additional results are available upon request.\n\n  10. When we include players who appear in only one season or play only a single game in either season, our conclusions are qualitatively unchanged but they become less precise, as a result of lowering the degree of comparability between the pre-Bubble and the Bubble sample (the additional estimations are available upon request).\n\n  11. Black players include mixed-race Black players. White players include one player who is mixed/Polynesian.\n\n  12. The coefficient on this variable is not identified on its own when we include \\\\(team \\times game\\\\) fixed effects because it is a game-specific characteristic that is absorbed by the team-game fixed effects. In this case, only its interaction with \\\\(Black_{it}\\\\) is identified.\n\n  13. Team-game fixed effects also capture spillover effects related to, e.g., the number of Black players in the player\u2019s team or the opponent team. Assuming that differences in the number of Black players between teams are random and, more generally, players are equally influenced by all the other team members (i.e., the interaction across players is constant in each team-game combination), the inclusion of team-game fixed effects implies that our analysis does not violate the assumption of Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) (Imbens and Rubin 2015) even in the presence of peer effects, and our estimates can be interpreted in a causal way. However, under more general interaction structures (as in Horrace et al. 2022), the magnitude of peer effects can vary across players and including team-game fixed effects is not sufficient to control for such effects. In this case, our estimates should be interpreted as \u201creduced form\u201d and would include both direct and indirect effects of racial pressure.\n\n  14. We further test robustness to the use of two-way clustered standard errors at the level of player-season and team-game.\n\n  15. The results are robust to the use of two-way clustered standard errors at the level of player-season and team-game (Col. 1 of Appendix Table A1). They are also robust to including players who only play a single game in either year (Col. 2 of Appendix Table A1), and to using Player Efficiency Rating (PER) and Value over Replacement Player (VORP) rating, alternative measures of performance based on the same data as the dependent variable (Col. 3 and Col. 4 of Appendix Table A1). PER is calculated in several steps. The first step is to sum up all of a player\u2019s positive accomplishments and to subtract the negative accomplishments in order to obtain an overall rating of a player\u2019s performance. Then, in the second step a player\u2019s performance is normalized within team and season. The full formula for PER can be found at Sports Reference (2022). On the other hand, VORP is calculated as (BPM + 2) * share of possessions of each player in a game where BPM is box plus minus per 100 possessions.\n\n  16. We run a cross-sectional regression of salaries in the 2018\u20132019 season as the dependent variable on players\u2019 average GS across the entire 2018\u20132019 season using salary data from ESPN (2022). The regression also includes year of birth, position dummies, and team fixed effects among the controls. The sample includes all players who played in the 2018\u20132019 season, that is 389. The coefficient on average GS is 1.01 million, which implies that an increase by one unit of GS is associated with an increase in salary by 1.01 million US dollars per year.\n\n  17. The value of 2.58 million US dollars per year is the product of the estimate of gamma in Col. 3 of Table 2 (2.552) and the coefficient obtained from regressing 2018\u20132019 salaries on average GS (1.01 million US dollars per year, see footnote 16).\n\n  18. Even if an official record did exist, it would be at best partial since racial abuse is difficult to record when it largely consists of slurs from a loud crowd comprising thousands of people who are difficult to monitor individually.\n\n  19. A related hypothesis is that our results may be partly driven by White players performing worse in the absence of fans (assuming White players receive stronger support from crowds than Black players, especially in certain cities). This possibility deserves further scrutiny, but it is consistent with the idea that fan pressure affects players\u2019 performance differently on the basis of race.\n\n  20. For completeness, we use both actual away games played outside the bubble and nominal away games played within the bubble, during which piped-in fan noise biased in favor of the nominal home team was played.\n\n  21. It is important to note that with the data at our disposal we can only characterize the racial composition of a team\u2019s fan base using TV viewership information. In-person attendance is likely to have an even lower share of Black fans who are on average less wealthy.\n\n  22. Following Silver (2019), players are considered at the replacement level if they are on two-way contracts, that is, they are on the fringe between the NBA and the G League, NBA\u2019s minor league.\n\n  23. Black players are represented in similar proportions among top and bottom performers. These results are robust to ranking players based on average WAR over the previous two (2017\u20132019) or three (2016\u20132019) seasons before the Bubble. They are also robust to using an alternative metric of performance called PREDATOR (Silver 2019), which is a predictive statistic that measures the number of points a player is expected to contribute to his team\u2019s offense and defense per 100 possessions, relative to a league-average player. Finally, they are robust to simply ranking players based on average Game Score (the outcome variable we use throughout the analysis) over the season prior to the Bubble. The additional estimates are available upon request.\n\n  24. While referees represent a fixed game characteristic, we can still interact this trait with being/not being in the Bubble and analyze how it relates to changes in performance. This is to say that we can look at the differential impact of referees outside/inside the bubble over and above other characteristics that are absorbed by the fixed effects. We do this to test whether referees changing behavior inside the bubble may have contributed to our results, but we do not find evidence of that.\n\n  25. It should be noted that we do not include the number of personal fouls in the main specification because it could be considered a \u201cbad\u201d control. Indeed, since the treatment in our analysis is the presence of fans, which has been shown to impact referee behavior, one could view the number of personal fouls as an outcome rather than a control variable. When we use fouls as a dependent variable in our empirical model, we do not find a statistically significant effect of the interaction between Black and Bubble. There is, therefore, no strong evidence in this context that fewer fouls are called against Black players inside the Bubble compared to outside of the Bubble. Despite this evidence, one may still be concerned that our measure of player performance may be affected by referee behavior. To investigate this further, one could measure player performance using the percentage of successful free throws, which one would not expect to be influenced by referees. Unfortunately, this alternative approach is practically impaired by the fact that only a share of all players ever attempt free throws. Within this highly selected sample, we do not find a statistically significant effect of the interaction between Black and Bubble. These additional results are available upon request.\n\n  26. On average, Black players are indeed slightly younger (28.5) than White players (28.8).\n\n  27. We reach the same conclusion if we analyze the 2018\u20132019 and 2019\u20132020 regular seasons. Since we use pre-Bubble games, the coefficient on the interaction between the Bubble and the dummy for Black players cannot be identified.\n\n  28. Since our analysis focuses on playoff games, one may worry that pressure is always high during such games independently of the point difference and that certain players may be particularly prone to faltering in those circumstances. To the contrary, existing work by Cao et al. (2011) shows that NBA players do not exhibit more faltering under pressure during games with higher stakes. This work also shows that performance under pressure is not affected by attendance, which supports our claim that sheer pressure from crowds is unlikely to explain our results and corroborates our conclusion that racist pressure is the most likely mechanism at play.\n\n## References\n\n  * Aizer, A., R.
