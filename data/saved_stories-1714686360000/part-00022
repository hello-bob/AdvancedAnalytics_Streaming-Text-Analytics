It detects the\npackage manager in use and runs the command for you!\n\n## Install TypeScript declarations\n\nIn TypeScript projects you always need to install the types for the packages\nyou are using. This is required so TypeScript can understand the package and\nprovide you with a better DX.\n\nInstead of installing the TypeScript declarations manually, px allows you to\ninstall them with a single command. It detects if a package has a TypeScript\ndeclaration package and it automatically installs it for you!\n\n$pnpm ibcryptjs$pnpm i-D @types/bcryptjs\n\n$ px install bcryptjs\n\n## Keep me in the Loop\n\nGet the latest updates and news for this project!\n\n## We're Hiring!\n\nWork with the world's most effective developers, data scientists, designers,\nand leaders who are shaping the future of humanity.\n\nJoin Us\n\n\u00a9 2024 AE Studio | pxOpen npm package\n\n", "frontpage": false}
