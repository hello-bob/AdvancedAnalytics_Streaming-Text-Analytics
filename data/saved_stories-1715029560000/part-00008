Here\u2019s the repo for the notes plugin, and\nhere\u2019s the page for Kanboard\u2019s plugin registry.\n\n# Why would you make yet another note taking app?\u2317\n\n  * I wanted to learn the ins and outs of Kanboard, my task tracking app of choice that I self host in my homelab.\n  * I wanted to get into writing plugins for things so I could show how useful and awesome plugins are.\n  * I wanted to see how others had implemented plugin architectures and see what I liked and didn\u2019t like.\n  * I wanted to use this myself as a replacement for Notes \u2018N Todos app I had previously installed.\n  * I wanted to release more software this year.\n\nThere\u2019s a good reason that there are so many note taking applications out\nthere. It\u2019s because it\u2019s a relatively simple product to deliver when learning\nnew or unfamiliar technology. That\u2019s why I choose to make a note taking app as\nmy first foray into Kanboard plugin development. I learned a lot from creating\nthis plugin and I wanted to share a few thoughts about my experience, what\nwent well, and what I would like to see improve.\n\n# What was it like to write a plugin for Kanboard?\u2317\n\nI think my biggest takeway from making this plugin was that the PSR-11 IoC\ncontainer is a fantastic interface that makes plugin systems like Kanboard\u2019s\neasy to develop. By allowing developers to have a globally injected object,\nyou get the benefit of availability that comes from global state with none of\nthe drawbacks. Furthermore, by allowing this container to be accessed by\nplugins you create a system in which all functionality could be written as a\nplugin. That\u2019s the kind of system that I want to build at some point this\nyear, but until then I\u2019ll be content having worked with Kanboard\u2019s plugin\nsystem. At the very least, starting my plugin focused project will allow me to\nwork with IoC containers in a language other than PHP.\n\n# What was it like to work with PHP in 2023 and 2024?\u2317\n\nNot too bad, but there are some pain points that come directly from PHP.\nFirst, the dollar sign prefix is silly. I understand it\u2019s necessary to carry\nforward because a design choice was made early on, and any change to it would\ncause all previous codebases to break. It\u2019s still not fun to debug and chase\ndown a weird syntax error ultimately caused by a missing dollar sign. That\nbeing said, modern IDEs (PHPStorm) make this point pretty much irrelevant.\nDebugging was also an issue, and I didn\u2019t really find a good way to inspect\nstate without using echo var_dump(some_var). It worked well enough and it was\nmuch less painful to debug this way than it would have been to get XDebug\nworking and exposed outside of the docker host I was developing on. It\u2019s on my\nradar for a second go-round to fix this particular issue, but for now I think\nit\u2019s good enough to just var_dump.\n\n# What will happen to your Notes \u2018N Todos instance?\u2317\n\nThat\u2019s a good question, I have already retired it after moving my notes from\nthe markdown files to my Kanboard database. I initially set up my Kanboard\ninstance with SQLite and that worked well for a long time, but I wanted to\nconsolidate and use a more scalable database at some point so I migrated to\nMariaDB before migrating my notes. Once I had migrated my notes, I just shut\ndown my notes instance. Unfortunately, my redirecting middleware service isn\u2019t\nset up yet so going to the notes instance url just pulls up a bad gateway\npage. In the future, I want to create a custom 404 page that will redirect to\nanother service if it\u2019s defined. I have an idea of wanting to animate a gopher\ndigging in a chest to see if it can find \u201cthe right host\u201d, and then returing\nit visually if it exists or shrugging otherwise. I realize that\u2019s a big\nstretch goal, but I think it could be super cool.\n\nRead other posts\n\nAPI Forward Reboot \u2192\n\n2021 Shamrocks Web, LLC. :: Theme made by panr\n\n", "frontpage": false}
