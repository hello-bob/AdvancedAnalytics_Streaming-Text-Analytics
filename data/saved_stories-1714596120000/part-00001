They keep a landline\nfor emergencies because their only Internet service is satellite, and cellular\nservice in the area is poor. Appel said they pay $41 a month for CenturyLink\nphone service.\n\nCenturyLink phone service became spotty and intermittent around January 20\nwhen winter storms hit the area and then went out completely on January 27,\nAppel told us. She contacted Ars nearly two months after the outage began,\ndesperate for a fix because her various chats with CenturyLink customer\nservice led nowhere.\n\nThe service was only fixed after Ars contacted CenturyLink, and Appel had to\nspend hours chatting with the company's support to get bill credits. The\nsurprise $239 bill had to do with phantom 411 calls made from her number\nduring the outage (more on that later in this article).\n\n\"I've chatted with them multiple times and had two canceled repair tickets\nsince then,\" Appel told us in late March when her service was still out. She\nsaid that customer service reps provided conflicting information on the status\nof the outage.\n\n\"I keep hearing different stories from representatives about how there is a\nwidespread outage in my area\u2014yet no outages are showing up on any outage map\nthat I can find,\" Appel told us at the time. \"One representative even told me\nthat the outage was fixed, scheduled a tech to come out, and then that ticket\nwas canceled without my knowledge. I reached out to CenturyLink today via\nchat, and they informed me that the outage is still affecting my area.\"\n\n## Not our first CenturyLink horror story\n\nIf this sounds familiar, you may have read our February 2024 article about\nCenturyLink leaving Oregon customers without Internet service for 39 days. In\nyet another case we wrote about last year, CenturyLink left 86-year-old\nMinnesota resident Helen Marie Plourde without home Internet and phone service\nfor over a month. In both of those instances, CenturyLink only fixed the\nservice after we emailed the company's public relations department.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe contacted CenturyLink about Appel's case on the afternoon of March 26, and\nthe company fixed her phone service on March 27. CenturyLink told us at the\ntime that it was \"trying to get all customers back online as soon as\npossible.\"\n\nA CenturyLink technician who fixed the service left a message for Appel saying\nthat a line serving her house had nearly been severed. It's unclear why it\ntook CenturyLink two months to fix the line or how much longer it would have\ntaken if the company never received a message from a media outlet.\n\n## Repairs promised but not delivered\n\nAppel provided us with transcripts of chats she had with CenturyLink customer\nsupport. On March 6, an agent told her the estimated time for a restoration\nwas 8 pm on March 7.\n\nIn a subsequent chat on March 9, one company rep told her that \"there is no\noutage reported.\" She was transferred to another agent who informed her that\nthere was an outage but that \"the outage was restored early this morning.\"\n\n\"I still have no dial tone,\" Appel responded to the agent. The agent then\nwrote, \"I understand, I have run a line analysis on your line and a dispatch\nis recommended to fix the issue.\"\n\nThe agent scheduled an appointment for March 19, but that date passed without\na repair. In another chat with customer support on March 20, Appel wrote, \"I\nhad a technician scheduled to come out yesterday. No one arrived and I got no\nnotifications of an appointment change or cancellation. My phone line is\ndead\u2014there is no dial tone.\"\n\nThe agent replied, \"I can see you are facing the issue with phone line. I will\ncertainly check and help you.\" About six minutes later, the agent confirmed\nthat a \"service outage is going on in your area\" and said it would be fixed on\nMarch 22.\n\nOf course, the fix didn't happen until March 27. Before Ars got involved,\nCenturyLink seemed to have \"no intent to restore my service, or at least were\nnot in any great hurry,\" Appel said.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n79\n\nJon Brodkin Jon has been a reporter for Ars Technica since 2011 and covers a\nwide array of telecom and tech policy topics.
