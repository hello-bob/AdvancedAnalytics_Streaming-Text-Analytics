Published 25-Mar-2024\n\nDid you know that there are two Easter dates? One date is 35 days late this\nyear. The reasons are lunar cycles and calendar computations.\n\nWestern Easter dates are based on the Gregorian calendar, eastern Easter dates\non the Julian calendar.\n\n\u00a9 iStockphoto.com/DNY59\n\n## When Is Easter?\n\nEaster 2024 is Sunday, March 31. Easter is also on Sunday, May 5, a difference\nof five weeks or 35 days. How can this be true?\n\nThere are two dates for Easter: Western Christian churches, such as the Roman\nCatholic Church, celebrate Easter Sunday on March 31, 2024; Eastern churches,\nlike the Greek Orthodox Church, celebrate Orthodox Easter on May 5, 2024. Both\nholidays celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ and both are the most\nimportant holiday for each church.\n\nIf both holidays are the same, why are they 35 days apart? Because they use\ndifferent calendars: Western churches calculate their Easter date based on the\nGregorian calendar, while Eastern churches use the Julian calendar.\n\n## Why Is the Orthodox Easter So Late?\n\nThe Julian calendar is currently 13 days behind the Gregorian calendar. Since\nthe Orthodox Christian churches use the Julian calendar to calculate Easter,\nit would only be logical to assume that eastern Easter is 13 days behind the\nwestern Easter\u2014both calendars are in sync and both holidays are on a Sunday.\n\nIn reality, the two Easter dates are never 13 days apart. They vary between 7\ndays, 28 days, 35 days, and even 0 days; yes, in some years, both Easters\nbecome one. Welcome to calendar mathematics.\n\nOur analysis of the timeanddate.com holiday and astronomical data shows the\nvarying differences between Easter dates relating to the Moon phase.\n\n\u00a9 timeanddate.com / Georg Rehberger\n\n## Julian Calendar Drifts Away\n\nThe main reason the Catholic Church replaced the Julian calendar in 1582 was\nthat it drifted out of sync with the seasons. Astronomical dates like\nsolstices and equinoxes were off by several days; the ecclesiastical Full Moon\ndrifts away from the true Full Moon by more than three days every millennium.\n\nIs the Julian calendar still in use?\n\nSince the Eastern churches still use the Julian calendar to define their\nholidays, the date of the Paschal Moon in that calendar, and thus their Easter\ndate, is offset by a week about 44% of the time. Both dates coincide and\ncreate one Easter for west and east in about 30% of cases. The rest is either\nfour or five weeks off; this happens when the Gregorian Paschal Moon happens\nbefore March 21 in the Julian calendar, causing the Orthodox date to jump\nahead to the next Full Moon.\n\nThe graph shows the offset between Western and Eastern Easter dates, and their\nintersection, resulting in the same Easter date every few years.\n\n\u00a9 timeanddate.com / Georg Rehberger\n\n## Computing the Error: Calendar Problems\n\nEaster celebrates re-birth and is thus connected to spring, when the Earth re-\nawakens after the winter months. The early Christian Church tied its holiest\nday to the first Full Moon of spring to start its ecclesiastical calendar. For\nthe first couple of hundred years, the Christian Church would announce the\nEaster date every year. This process was replaced by calculating the date in\nadvance; and since Easter was still tied to the first Full Moon of spring, it\nwas dependent both on lunar cycles and on the solar year to match the season\nof spring.\n\nThe calculation of Easter, the computus, was a massive undertaking. The\ncalculation had to overcome complications with shifting lunar cycles and\nincorrect oversimplifications of leap days and leap years. The Gregorian\ncalendar was the latest in a sequence of reforms to get the Easter date \u201cback\non track.\u201d\n\nCalculating the Easter Date\n\nThere are still many proposals underway to fix computational errors, and\ndifferent churches have their own preferences for methods and calendars. This\nmeans we will likely continue to see two different Easter dates for some time.\n\n### Calendar History\n\n  1. Gregorian Calendar\n  2. Julian Calendar\n  3.
