DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2313797121\n\nA team of oceanographers and planetary scientists at the Ocean University of\nChina, working with a pair of colleagues from the U.S. and one in Germany, has\nfound via computer modeling, that recent heat waves in the north Pacific may\nbe due to a large reduction in aerosols emitted by factories in China.\n\nIn their paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of\nSciences, the group describes how they used several climate models and various\nfactors that allowed them to find patterns that might be linked to the\nreduction of aerosols emitted into the atmosphere by China.\n\nOver the past decade, the north Pacific has experienced multiple heat waves,\nleading to fish die-offs, toxic algae blooms and missing whales. Such heat\nwaves have been generally attributed to global warming, but to date, no\nresearch has been able to pinpoint how global warming could cause such sudden\nand variable increases in a specific part of the planet.\n\nIn this new effort, the research team noted that the onset of the heat waves\nappeared to follow successful efforts by the Chinese government to reduce\naerosol emissions from their country's factories. Beginning around 2010,\nfactories and power generating plants in China began dramatically reducing\nemissions of aerosols such as sulfate, resulting in much cleaner air.\n\nNoting that aerosols can act like mirrors floating in the air, reflecting heat\nfrom the sun back into space, and also pointing out that earlier research\nefforts had suggested that massive reductions of aerosols in one place could\nlead to warming in other places\u2014they wondered if reductions of aerosols in\nChina might be playing a role in the heat waves that began happening in the\nnorth Pacific.\n\nTo find out if that might be the case, the team began collecting data and then\ninput it into 12 different computer climate models. They ran them under two\nconditions\u2014one where emissions from East Asia remained as they were over the\npast several decades and one where they dropped in the way they had in\nreality. They found that the models with no declines did not cause much change\nelsewhere, whereas those with aerosol drops showed heat waves occurring in the\nnortheast parts of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe models also showed why\u2014as less heat was reflected back into space over\nChina, warming of coastal regions in Asia began, resulting in the development\nof high-pressure systems. That in turn made low-pressure systems in the middle\nPacific more intense. And that resulted in the Aleutian Low growing bigger and\nmoving south which weakened the westerly winds that typically cool the sea\nsurface. The result was hotter conditions.\n\nMore information: Hai Wang et al, Atmosphere teleconnections from abatement of\nChina aerosol emissions exacerbate Northeast Pacific warm blob events,\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2024).
