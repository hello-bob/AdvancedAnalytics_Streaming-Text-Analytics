It is hoped that the\nnew law will correct problematic practices of tech giants and promote more\ncompetition in the app and other markets.\n\nIf a company violates the envisaged law, the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) will\nimpose a fine worth 20% of domestic sales in the relevant field. The monetary\npenalty, a big increase from the basic 10% level under the Antimonopoly Law,\ncan rise to 30% if repeated violations occur.\n\nSince the global sales of tech giants amount to tens of trillions of yen, the\ngovernment considered it necessary to impose a high monetary penalty in order\nto ensure compliance with the regulations and to prevent them from making\nprofit unjustly.\n\nGiant tech companies will be required to submit reports every year and the FTC\nwill monitor their compliance. The bill also includes a system for the FTC to\npetition a court for an \u201cemergency suspension order\u201d to temporarily halt acts\nof noncompliance.\n\nThe bill also contains specific regulations such as: stopping companies\npreventing other companies from offering alternative app stores; requiring\ncompanies to allow users to easily change default app settings, and banning\ncompanies from prioritizing their own products and services in search results.\n\nAmid concerns that opening up app stores could allow the easy spread of\nmalware, the bill will allow tech giants to take necessary security measures\nwhen other companies enter the app store market.\n\nIn 2021, the government implemented the Improving Transparency and Fairness of\nDigital Platforms Law, which requires tech giants to disclose terms and\nconditions and other information. The new law will add to regulations that\ntarget tech giants.\n\nIn other countries and regions, the European Union has implemented the Digital\nMarkets Act, which prohibits big tech companies from promoting their own\nproducts and services over other companies, among other rules. Violators face\na fine of up to 10% of their total worldwide turnover. Similar legislation is\nalso being introduced in the United Kingdom and other countries. In March, the\nU.S. Justice Department sued Apple over antitrust violations.\n\nAdd TheJapanNews to your Google News feed.\n\n## Politics & Government Latest Articles\n\n  * ### 2024 Diplomatic Bluebook Highlights Japan-China Dialogue Amid Mil...\n\n  * ### Kamikawa: Japan strongly condemns Iranian attacks on Israel; Japa...\n\n  * ### Japan Lower House OKs Joint Child Custody Bill\n\n  * ### JFTC to Take Administrative Action against Google for Demanding Y...\n\n## Latest Articles\n\n  * ### Ex-PM Suga Inspects Fukushima Nuclear Plant\n\n  * ### Stolen Buddhist Statue Returned to Nara Prefecture Temple via Onl...\n\n  * ### Iran\u2019s attack : Countries Concerned Must Work to Break Chain of R...\n\n  * ### Cashless Payments: Urgently improvesecurity of transactions\n\n## Popular Articles\n\n  * ### Shinkansen Services Suspended After Man \u2018Searches for Phone\u2019 on T...\n\n  * ### Japan, U.S., Philippines to Strengthen Nickel Supply Chains; Redu...\n\n  * ### Sumo: Former Yokozuna Akebono Dies of Heart Failure at 54 (Update...\n\n  * ### Japan Ministry Sounds Alarm Over Hungry Bears in Spring; May Atta...\n\n  * ### Japan's Cutting-Edge Semiconductor Company Rapidus Establishes 1s...\n\n  * ### Famous Weeping Cherry Tree in Full Blossom in Fukushima Pref.
