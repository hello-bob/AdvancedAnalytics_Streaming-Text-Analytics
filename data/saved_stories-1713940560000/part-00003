But you\nwon't catch Tom Hodgkinson volunteering his personal information - not now\nthat he knows the politics of the people behind the social networking site\n\n  * Tom Hodgkinson\n\n  * The Guardian, Monday 14 January 2008\n\nThe following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and\nclarifications column, Wednesday January 16 2008\n\nThe US intelligence community's enthusiasm for hi-tech innovation after 9/11\nand the creation of In-Q-Tel, its venture capital fund, in 1999 were\nanachronistically linked in the article below. Since 9/11 happened in 2001 it\ncould not have led to the setting up of In-Q-Tel two years earlier.\n\nI despise Facebook. This enormously successful American business describes\nitself as \"a social utility that connects you with the people around you\". But\nhang on. Why on God's earth would I need a computer to connect with the people\naround me? Why should my relationships be mediated through the imagination of\na bunch of supergeeks in California? What was wrong with the pub?\n\nAnd does Facebook really connect people? Doesn't it rather disconnect us,\nsince instead of doing something enjoyable such as talking and eating and\ndancing and drinking with my friends, I am merely sending them little\nungrammatical notes and amusing photos in cyberspace, while chained to my\ndesk? A friend of mine recently told me that he had spent a Saturday night at\nhome alone on Facebook, drinking at his desk. What a gloomy image. Far from\nconnecting us, Facebook actually isolates us at our workstations.\n\nFacebook appeals to a kind of vanity and self-importance in us, too. If I put\nup a flattering picture of myself with a list of my favourite things, I can\nconstruct an artificial representation of who I am in order to get sex or\napproval. (\"I like Facebook,\" said another friend. \"I got a shag out of it.\")\nIt also encourages a disturbing competitivness around friendship: it seems\nthat with friends today, quality counts for nothing and quantity is king. The\nmore friends you have, the better you are. You are \"popular\", in the sense\nmuch loved in American high schools. Witness the cover line on Dennis\nPublishing's new Facebook magazine: \"How To Double Your Friends List.\"\n\nIt seems, though, that I am very much alone in my hostility. At the time of\nwriting Facebook claims 59 million active users, including 7 million in the\nUK, Facebook's third-biggest customer after the US and Canada. That's 59\nmillion suckers, all of whom have volunteered their ID card information and\nconsumer preferences to an American business they know nothing about. Right\nnow, 2 million new people join each week. At the present rate of growth,\nFacebook will have more than 200 million active users by this time next year.\nAnd I would predict that, if anything, its rate of growth will accelerate over\nthe coming months. As its spokesman Chris Hughes says: \"It's embedded itself\nto an extent where it's hard to get rid of.\"\n\nAll of the above would have been enough to make me reject Facebook for ever.\nBut there are more reasons to hate it. Many more.\n\nFacebook is a well-funded project, and the people behind the funding, a group\nof Silicon Valley venture capitalists, have a clearly thought out ideology\nthat they are hoping to spread around the world. Facebook is one manifestation\nof this ideology. Like PayPal before it, it is a social experiment, an\nexpression of a particular kind of neoconservative libertarianism. On\nFacebook, you can be free to be who you want to be, as long as you don't mind\nbeing bombarded by adverts for the world's biggest brands. As with PayPal,\nnational boundaries are a thing of the past.\n\nAlthough the project was initially conceived by media cover star Mark\nZuckerberg, the real face behind Facebook is the 40-year-old Silicon Valley\nventure capitalist and futurist philosopher Peter Thiel. There are only three\nboard members on Facebook, and they are Thiel, Zuckerberg and a third investor\ncalled Jim Breyer from a venture capital firm called Accel Partners (more on\nhim later). Thiel invested $500,000 in Facebook when Harvard students\nZuckerberg, Chris Hughes and Dustin Moskowitz went to meet him in San\nFrancisco in June 2004, soon after they had launched the site. Thiel now\nreportedly owns 7% of Facebook, which, at Facebook's current valuation of\n$15bn, would be worth more than $1bn. There is much debate on who exactly were\nthe original co-founders of Facebook, but whoever they were, Zuckerberg is the\nonly one left on the board, although Hughes and Moskowitz still work for the\ncompany.\n\nThiel is widely regarded in Silicon Valley and in the US venture capital scene\nas a libertarian genius. He is the co-founder and CEO of the virtual banking\nsystem PayPal, which he sold to Ebay for $1.5bn, taking $55m for himself. He\nalso runs a \u00a33bn hedge fund called Clarium Capital Management and a venture\ncapital fund called Founders Fund. Bloomberg Markets magazine recently called\nhim \"one of the most successful hedge fund managers in the country\". He has\nmade money by betting on rising oil prices and by correctly predicting that\nthe dollar would weaken. He and his absurdly wealthy Silicon Valley mates have\nrecently been labelled \"The PayPal Mafia\" by Fortune magazine, whose reporter\nalso observed that Thiel has a uniformed butler and a $500,000 McLaren\nsupercar. Thiel is also a chess master and intensely competitive. He has been\nknown to sweep the chessmen off the table in a fury when losing. And he does\nnot apologise for this hyper-competitveness, saying: \"Show me a good loser and\nI'll show you a loser.\"\n\nBut Thiel is more than just a clever and avaricious capitalist. He is a\nfuturist philosopher and neocon activist. A philosophy graduate from Stanford,\nin 1998 he co-wrote a book called The Diversity Myth, which is a detailed\nattack on liberalism and the multiculturalist ideology that dominated\nStanford. He claimed that the \"multiculture\" led to a lessening of individual\nfreedoms. While a student at Stanford, Thiel founded a rightwing journal,\nstill up and running, called The Stanford Review - motto: Fiat Lux (\"Let there\nbe light\"). Thiel is a member of TheVanguard.Org, an internet-based\nneoconservative pressure group that was set up to attack MoveOn.org, a liberal\npressure group that works on the web. Thiel calls himself \"way libertarian\".\n\nTheVanguard is run by one Rod D Martin, a philosopher-capitalist whom Thiel\ngreatly admires. On the site, Thiel says: \"Rod is one of our nation's leading\nminds in the creation of new and needed ideas for public policy. He possesses\na more complete understanding of America than most executives have of their\nown businesses.\"\n\nThis little taster from their website will give you an idea of their vision\nfor the world: \"TheVanguard.Org is an online community of Americans who\nbelieve in conservative values, the free market and limited government as the\nbest means to bring hope and ever-increasing opportunity to everyone,\nespecially the poorest among us.\" Their aim is to promote policies that will\n\"reshape America and the globe\". TheVanguard describes its politics as\n\"Reaganite/Thatcherite\". The chairman's message says: \"Today we'll teach\nMoveOn [the liberal website], Hillary and the leftwing media some lessons they\nnever imagined.\"\n\nSo, Thiel's politics are not in doubt. What about his philosophy? I listened\nto a podcast of an address Thiel gave about his ideas for the future. His\nphilosophy, briefly, is this: since the 17th century, certain enlightened\nthinkers have been taking the world away from the old-fashioned nature-bound\nlife, and here he quotes Thomas Hobbes' famous characterisation of life as\n\"nasty, brutish and short\", and towards a new virtual world where we have\nconquered nature. Value now exists in imaginary things. Thiel says that PayPal\nwas motivated by this belief: that you can find value not in real manufactured\nobjects, but in the relations between human beings. PayPal was a way of moving\nmoney around the world with no restriction. Bloomberg Markets puts it like\nthis: \"For Thiel, PayPal was all about freedom: it would enable people to\nskirt currency controls and move money around the globe.\"\n\nClearly, Facebook is another uber-capitalist experiment: can you make money\nout of friendship? Can you create communities free of national boundaries -\nand then sell Coca-Cola to them? Facebook is profoundly uncreative. It makes\nnothing at all. It simply mediates in relationships that were happening\nanyway.\n\nPhoto: Tim Boyle/Getty\n\nThiel's philosophical mentor is one Ren\u00e9 Girard of Stanford University,\nproponent of a theory of human behaviour called mimetic desire. Girard reckons\nthat people are essentially sheep-like and will copy one another without much\nreflection. The theory would also seem to be proved correct in the case of\nThiel's virtual worlds: the desired object is irrelevant; all you need to know\nis that human beings will tend to move in flocks. Hence financial bubbles.\nHence the enormous popularity of Facebook. Girard is a regular at Thiel's\nintellectual soirees. What you don't hear about in Thiel's philosophy, by the\nway, are old-fashioned real-world concepts such as art, beauty, love, pleasure\nand truth.\n\nThe internet is immensely appealing to neocons such as Thiel because it\npromises a certain sort of freedom in human relations and in business, freedom\nfrom pesky national laws, national boundaries and suchlike. The internet opens\nup a world of free trade and laissez-faire expansion. Thiel also seems to\napprove of offshore tax havens, and claims that 40% of the world's wealth\nresides in places such as Vanuatu, the Cayman Islands, Monaco and Barbados. I\nthink it's fair to say that Thiel, like Rupert Murdoch, is against tax. He\nalso likes the globalisation of digital culture because it makes the banking\noverlords hard to attack: \"You can't have a workers' revolution to take over a\nbank if the bank is in Vanuatu,\" he says.\n\nIf life in the past was nasty, brutish and short, then in the future Thiel\nwants to make it much longer, and to this end he has also invested in a firm\nthat is exploring life-extension technologies. He has pledged \u00a33.5m to a\nCambridge-based gerontologist called Aubrey de Grey, who is searching for the\nkey to immortality. Thiel is also on the board of advisers of something called\nthe Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence. From its fantastical\nwebsite, the following: \"The Singularity is the technological creation of\nsmarter-than-human intelligence. There are several technologies ... heading in\nthis direction ... Artificial Intelligence ... direct brain-computer\ninterfaces ... genetic engineering ... different technologies which, if they\nreached a threshold level of sophistication, would enable the creation of\nsmarter-than-human intelligence.\"\n\nSo by his own admission, Thiel is trying to destroy the real world, which he\nalso calls \"nature\", and install a virtual world in its place, and it is in\nthis context that we must view the rise of Facebook. Facebook is a deliberate\nexperiment in global manipulation, and Thiel is a bright young thing in the\nneoconservative pantheon, with a penchant for far-out techno-utopian\nfantasies. Not someone I want to help get any richer.\n\nThe third board member of Facebook is Jim Breyer. He is a partner in the\nventure capital firm Accel Partners, who put $12.7m into Facebook in April\n2005. On the board of such US giants as Wal-Mart and Marvel Entertainment, he\nis also a former chairman of the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA).\nNow these are the people who are really making things happen in America,\nbecause they invest in the new young talent, the Zuckerbergs and the like.\nFacebook's most recent round of funding was led by a company called Greylock\nVenture Capital, who put in the sum of $27.5m. One of Greylock's senior\npartners is called Howard Cox, another former chairman of the NVCA, who is\nalso on the board of In-Q-Tel. What's In-Q-Tel? Well, believe it or not (and\ncheck out their website), this is the venture-capital wing of the CIA. After\n9/11, the US intelligence community became so excited by the possibilities of\nnew technology and the innovations being made in the private sector, that in\n1999 they set up their own venture capital fund, In-Q-Tel, which \"identifies\nand partners with companies developing cutting-edge technologies to help\ndeliver these solutions to the Central Intelligence Agency and the broader US\nIntelligence Community (IC) to further their missions\".\n\nThe US defence department and the CIA love technology because it makes spying\neasier. \"We need to find new ways to deter new adversaries,\" defence secretary\nDonald Rumsfeld said in 2003. \"We need to make the leap into the information\nage, which is the critical foundation of our transformation efforts.\" In-Q-\nTel's first chairman was Gilman Louie, who served on the board of the NVCA\nwith Breyer. Another key figure in the In-Q-Tel team is Anita K Jones, former\ndirector of defence research and engineering for the US department of defence,\nand - with Breyer - board member of BBN Technologies. When she left the US\ndepartment of defence, Senator Chuck Robb paid her the following tribute: \"She\nbrought the technology and operational military communities together to design\ndetailed plans to sustain US dominance on the battlefield into the next\ncentury.\"\n\nNow even if you don't buy the idea that Facebook is some kind of extension of\nthe American imperialist programme crossed with a massive information-\ngathering tool, there is no way of denying that as a business, it is pure\nmega-genius. Some net nerds have suggsted that its $15bn valuation is\nexcessive, but I would argue that if anything that is too modest. Its scale\nreally is dizzying, and the potential for growth is virtually limitless. \"We\nwant everyone to be able to use Facebook,\" says the impersonal voice of Big\nBrother on the website. I'll bet they do. It is Facebook's enormous potential\nthat led Microsoft to buy 1.6% for $240m. A recent rumour says that Asian\ninvestor Lee Ka-Shing, said to be the ninth richest man in the world, has\nbought 0.4% of Facebook for $60m.\n\nThe creators of the site need do very little bar fiddle with the programme. In\nthe main, they simply sit back and watch as millions of Facebook addicts\nvoluntarily upload their ID details, photographs and lists of their favourite\nconsumer objects. Once in receipt of this vast database of human beings,\nFacebook then simply has to sell the information back to advertisers, or, as\nZuckerberg puts it in a recent blog post, \"to try to help people share\ninformation with their friends about things they do on the web\". And indeed,\nthis is precisely what's happening. On November 6 last year, Facebook\nannounced that 12 global brands had climbed on board. They included Coca-Cola,\nBlockbuster, Verizon, Sony Pictures and Cond\u00e9 Nast. All trained in marketing\nbullshit of the highest order, their representatives made excited comments\nalong the following lines:\n\n\"With Facebook Ads, our brands can become a part of the way users communicate\nand interact on Facebook,\" said Carol Kruse, vice president, global\ninteractive marketing, the Coca-Cola Company.\n\n\"We view this as an innovative way to cultivate relationships with millions of\nFacebook users by enabling them to interact with Blockbuster in convenient,\nrelevant and entertaining ways,\" said Jim Keyes, Blockbuster chairman and CEO.\n\"This is beyond creating advertising impressions. This is about Blockbuster\nparticipating in the community of the consumer so that, in return, consumers\nfeel motivated to share the benefits of our brand with their friends.\"\n\n\"Share\" is Facebookspeak for \"advertise\". Sign up to Facebook and you become a\nfree walking, talking advert for Blockbuster or Coke, extolling the virtues of\nthese brands to your friends. We are seeing the commodification of human\nrelationships, the extraction of capitalistic value from friendships.\n\nNow, by comparision with Facebook, newspapers, for example, begin to look\nhopelessly outdated as a business model. A newspaper sells advertising space\nto businesses looking to sell stuff to their readers. But the system is far\nless sophisticated than Facebook for two reasons. One is that newspapers have\nto put up with the irksome expense of paying journalists to provide the\ncontent. Facebook gets its content for free. The other is that Facebook can\ntarget advertising with far greater precision than a newspaper. Admit on\nFacebook that your favourite film is This Is Spinal Tap, and when a Spinal\nTap-esque movie comes out, you can be sure that they'll be sending ads your\nway.\n\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg (Photo: Paul Sakuma/AP)\n\nIt's true that Facebook recently got into hot water with its Beacon\nadvertising programme. Users were notified that one of their friends had made\na purchase at certain online shops; 46,000 users felt that this level of\nadvertising was intrusive, and signed a petition called \"Facebook! Stop\ninvading my privacy!\" to say so. Zuckerberg apologised on his company blog. He\nhas written that they have now changed the system from \"opt-out\" to \"opt-in\".\nBut I suspect that this little rebellion about being so ruthlessly commodified\nwill soon be forgotten: after all, there was a national outcry by the civil\nliberties movement when the idea of a police force was mooted in the UK in the\nmid 19th century.\n\nFuthermore, have you Facebook users ever actually read the privacy policy? It\ntells you that you don't have much privacy. Facebook pretends to be about\nfreedom, but isn't it really more like an ideologically motivated virtual\ntotalitarian regime with a population that will very soon exceed the UK's?\nThiel and the rest have created their own country, a country of consumers.\n\nNow, you may, like Thiel and the other new masters of the cyberverse, find\nthis social experiment tremendously exciting. Here at last is the\nEnlightenment state longed for since the Puritans of the 17th century sailed\naway to North America, a world where everyone is free to express themselves as\nthey please, according to who is watching. National boundaries are a thing of\nthe past and everyone cavorts together in freewheeling virtual space. Nature\nhas been conquered through man's boundless ingenuity. Yes, and you may decide\nto send genius investor Thiel all your money, and certainly you'll be waiting\nimpatiently for the public flotation of the unstoppable Facebook.\n\nOr you might reflect that you don't really want to be part of this heavily-\nfunded programme to create an arid global virtual republic, where your own\nself and your relationships with your friends are converted into commodites on\nsale to giant global brands. You may decide that you don't want to be part of\nthis takeover bid for the world.\n\nFor my own part, I am going to retreat from the whole thing, remain as\nunplugged as possible, and spend the time I save by not going on Facebook\ndoing something useful, such as reading books. Why would I want to waste my\ntime on Facebook when I still haven't read Keats' Endymion? And when there are\nseeds to be sown in my own back yard? I don't want to retreat from nature, I\nwant to reconnect with it. Damn air-conditioning! And if I want to connect\nwith the people around me, I will revert to an old piece of technology. It's\nfree, it's easy and it delivers a uniquely individual experience in sharing\ninformation: it's called talking.\n\n## Facebook's privacy policy\n\nJust for fun, try substituting the words 'Big Brother' whenever you read the\nword 'Facebook'\n\n1 We will advertise at you\n\n\"When you use Facebook, you may set up your personal profile, form\nrelationships, send messages, perform searches and queries, form groups, set\nup events, add applications, and transmit information through various\nchannels.
