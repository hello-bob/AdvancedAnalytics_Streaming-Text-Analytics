Additionally, 37% are\nworried about meeting basic living costs such as food and housing.\n\n\u201cFar too many people lack access to retirement savings options and this,\ncoupled with higher prices, is making it increasingly hard for people to\nchoose when to retire,\u201d said Indira Venkateswaran, AARP's senior vice\npresident of research. \u201cEveryday expenses continue to be the top barrier to\nsaving more for retirement, and some older Americans say that they never\nexpect to retire.\u201d\n\nThe share of people 50 and older who say they do not expect to retire has\nremained steady. It was 23% in January 2022 and 24% that July, according to\nthe study, which is conducted twice a year\n\n\"We are seeing an expansion of older workers staying in the workforce,\" said\nDavid John, senior strategic policy advisor at the AARP Public Policy\nInstitute. He said this is in part because older workers \u201cdon't have\nsufficient retirement savings. It's a problem and its likely to continue as we\ngo forward.\u201d\n\nBased on the 2022 congressional elections, census data released Tuesday shows\nthat voters 65 and older made up 30.4% of all voters, while Gen Z and\nmillennials accounted for 11.7%.\n\nBiden has tried to court older voters by regularly promoting a $35 price cap\non insulin for people on Medicare. He trumpets Medicare\u2019s powers to negotiate\ndirectly with drugmakers on the cost of prescription medications.\n\nTrump, in an interview with CNBC in March, indicated he would be open to cuts\nto Social Security and Medicare. The former president said \u201cthere is a lot you\ncan do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting.\u201d\n\nKaroline Leavitt, press secretary for Trump's campaign, said in a statement to\nThe Associated Press on Tuesday that Trump \u201cwill continue to strongly protect\nSocial Security and Medicare in his second term.\"\n\nIn the AARP survey, 33% of respondents 50 and older believe their finances\nwill be better in a year.\n\nA looming issue that will affect Americans' ability to retire is the financial\nhealth of Social Security and Medicare.\n\nThe latest annual report from the program's trustees says the financial safety\nnets for millions of older Americans will run short of money to pay full\nbenefits within the next decade.\n\nMedicare, the government-sponsored health insurance that covers 65 million\nolder and disabled people, will be unable to pay full benefits for inpatient\nhospital visits and nursing home stays by 2031, the report forecast. And just\ntwo years later, Social Security will not have enough cash on hand to pay out\nfull benefits to its 66 million retirees.\n\nAn AP-NORC poll from March 2023 found that most U.S. adults are opposed to\nproposals that would cut into Medicare or Social Security benefits, and a\nmajority support raising taxes on the nation\u2019s highest earners to keep\nMedicare running as is.\n\n## Top Stories\n\n### Could a president stage a coup?
