Can we do better?\n\nHere in our own Solar System, a single star anchors the system, where inner,\nrocky planets, an intermediate-distance asteroid belt, and then more distant\ngas giant planets eventually give way to the Kuiper belt and Oort cloud. For a\nlong time, we assumed this configuration was typical and common. Today, we\nknow better.\n\nCredit: NASA/Dana Berry\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n  * Today, we can trace the Big Bang back to having occurred some 13.8 billion years ago, with the size of the observable Universe stretching to 46.1 billion light-years.\n  * But not only are units like \"years\" and \"light-years\" completely arbitrary and Earth-centric, they haven't even had consistent definitions over the history of Earth.\n  * There might be better ways to measure time, especially for the Universe, but every alternative has its drawbacks, too.\n\nEthan Siegel\n\nShare The better way to measure cosmic time on Facebook\n\nShare The better way to measure cosmic time on Twitter (X)\n\nShare The better way to measure cosmic time on LinkedIn\n\nThere are a number of grand questions we can ask about the Universe that cut\nright to the very core of what reality actually is, and were some of the\nbiggest head-scratchers for all of human history. Questions like, \u201cWhat is the\nUniverse?\u201d \u201cHow big is it?\u201d and \u201cWas it eternal, or did it spring into\nexistence, and if so, when?\u201d used to be some of the greatest philosophical\nmysteries, and yet the last 100 years have provided firm, scientific answers.\nWe know what the Universe is, we know that the part observable to us is a hair\nover 92 billion light-years in diameter, and we know that the hot Big Bang,\nwhich started off the Universe as-we-know-it, occurred precisely 13.8 billion\nyears ago, with an uncertainty in these values of just ~1% or so.\n\nBut why, of all the ways there are to measure time and distance, do we use\nsuch an Earth-centric set of units, like \u201cyears\u201d and \u201clight-years\u201d? Isn\u2019t\nthere a better, more objective, more universal way to do it? Surely there is.\nAt least, that\u2019s what Jerry Bear thinks, writing in to ask:\n\n\u201cWhy do cosmological calculations, such as the age or scale of the universe,\nutilize the provincial and wildly, woefully unequal to the task parameter of\n\u2018year\u2019? A year\u2019s value as a measurement is so narrowly defined as to render it\ninappropriate to my mind. I mean, the basis of \u2018year\u2019 has only even existed\nfor the most recent 30% of the universe\u2019s age! And obviously the critical\nconcept of a light-year is also tied to this parochial measurement.\u201d\n\nAll of these are excellent points and are worth both expanding on and\nconsidering the alternatives to these somewhat arbitrary definitions. Let\u2019s\nlook at the science behind measuring cosmic time.\n\nNearby, the stars and galaxies we see look very much like our own. But as we\nlook farther away, we see the Universe as it was in the distant past: less\nstructured, hotter, younger, and less evolved. In many ways, there are edges\nto how far back we can see in the Universe.\n\nCredit: NASA/ESA/STScI/A. Feild\n\nThere are really only two ways, here on Earth, to make sense of the concept of\nthe passage of time, and both make use of the regular recurrence of phenomena\nthat are essential to not only human activity, but all biological activity. On\nshorter timescales, we have the concept of days, which are important for a\nnumber of reasons, including:\n\n  * they mark sunrise and sunset,\n  * they correspond to (roughly) a single complete rotation of Earth about its axis,\n  * they correspond to the period where most plants and animals experience both activity and dormancy,\n\nall followed by a repeat of all of these phenomena, and more, on the next day.\nMeanwhile, on longer timescales, it\u2019s very apparent that there are substantial\ndifferences between subsequent days, that themselves repeat if we wait long\nenough. Over the course of a year, days change in a variety of ways,\nincluding:\n\n  * sunrise and sunset times advance and retreat,\n  * the duration of daylight waxes and wanes,\n  * the Sun reaches a maximum in its height above the horizon, followed by a minimum, and a return to its original position again,\n  * the seasons change in a cycle,\n  * and the biological activity of plants, animals, and other living creatures change along with them.\n\nEach year, with very little variation, the cycles of the previous year once\nagain repeat themselves.\n\nAs the Earth orbits the Sun in an ellipse, it moves more quickly at perihelion\n(closest-to-the-Sun) and more slowly at aphelion (farthest-from-the-Sun),\nwhich leads to changes in the time at which the Sun rises and sets, as well as\nthe duration of the actual day, over the course of a year. The obliquity of\nEarth\u2019s orbit also affects the equation of time. These patterns repeat\nannually and are latitude-specific, but generally lead to a \u201cfigure 8\u201d pattern\nfor Earth\u2019s analemma: the shape our Sun traces throughout the sky at the same\ntime every day throughout the year.\n\nCredit: Rob Carr/Wikimedia Commons\n\nBased on this, it\u2019s easy to understand why we came up with a system of\ntimekeeping that is based around concepts such as a \u201cday\u201d and a \u201cyear,\u201d as our\nactivity on this planet is very tightly correlated with those periodic\nrecurrences. But on closer inspection, for a variety of reasons, the notion of\ndays and years as we experience them on Earth don\u2019t particularly translate\nvery well into a universal set of axioms for marking the passage of time.\n\nFor one, the duration of a day has changed substantially over the history of\nplanet Earth. As the Moon, Earth, and Sun all interact, the phenomenon of\ntidal friction causes our day to lengthen and the Moon to spiral away from\nEarth. Some ~4 billion years ago, a \u201cday\u201d on planet Earth only lasted 6-to-8\nhours, and there were over one thousand days in a year.\n\nThe variation in a year, however \u2014 or the time period required for Earth to\ncomplete a full revolution around the Sun \u2014 has only changed a little bit over\nthe Solar System\u2019s history. The largest factor is the changing mass of the\nSun, which has lost about a Saturn\u2019s worth of mass over its lifetime so far.\nThis also pushes Earth out to distances a little bit farther from the Sun, and\ncauses it to orbit slightly more slowly over time. This has caused the year to\nlengthen, but only slightly: by about 2 parts in 10,000. This corresponds to\nthe year lengthening by about 2 hours from the start of the Solar System until\ntoday.\n\nThe Earth orbits the Sun not in a perfect circle, but rather in an ellipse.\nThe eccentricity, or the difference between the \u201clong axis\u201d and the \u201cshort\naxis\u201d of our orbit, changes over time, while the Earth-Sun orbital period,\nwhich defines our year, changes slowly over the lifetime of our Solar System.\nIf we neglect the other planets and the mass loss of the Sun due to the solar\nwind and nuclear fusion, we\u2019d find that the total angular momentum of the\nEarth-Sun(-and-moon, if you like) system remains conserved.\n\nCredit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nEven with all of the complex astrophysics taking place in our Solar System,\nthen, it\u2019s apparent that the duration of a year is probably the most stable\nlarge-scale feature that we could use to anchor our timekeeping to our planet.\nSince the speed of light is a known and measurable constant, a \u201clight-year\u201d\nthen arises as a derived unit of distance, and also only changes by very\nlittle over time; it\u2019s consistent over billions of years to the ~99.98% level.\n\nThe other major definition that we sometimes use is also, albeit indirectly,\nbased on the definition of Earth orbiting the Sun to make up a year: the\nparsec. Instead of being based on time alone, it\u2019s based on astronomical\nangles and trigonometry. As the Earth orbits around the Sun, the apparent\npositions of unmoving stars, relative to one another, will appear to change\nrelative to one another, in the same way that if you open only one eye and\nthen switch eyes, the closer objects will appear to shift relative to the more\ndistant background objects.\n\nIn astronomy, we call this phenomenon \u201cparallax,\u201d and instead of the distance\nbetween two typical human eyes, we use the maximum distance between Earth\u2019s\nposition relative to the Sun: the diameter of its orbit, or about 300,000,000\nkilometers. An object that appears to shift, relative to the distant\nbackground of objects, by one arc-second (1/3600th of a degree) is defined as\none parsec: about 3.26 light-years.\n\nThe stars that are closest to Earth will appear to shift periodically with\nrespect to the more distant stars as the Earth moves through space in orbit\naround the Sun. Before the heliocentric model was established, we weren\u2019t\nlooking for \u201cshifts\u201d with a ~300,000,000 kilometer baseline over the span of\n~6 months, but rather a ~12,000 kilometer baseline over the span of one night:\nEarth\u2019s diameter as it rotated on its axis. The distances to the stars are so\ngreat that it wasn\u2019t until the 1830s that the first parallax, with a 300\nmillion km baseline, was detected. Today, we\u2019ve measured the parallax of over\n1 billion stars with ESA\u2019s Gaia mission.\n\nCredit: ESA/ATG medialab\n\nBut why would we tie our definition of time, which extends to the whole\nUniverse, to the arbitrary motion of one planet in one galaxy around its\nparent star? It\u2019s not objective, it\u2019s not absolute, and it\u2019s not useful beyond\nour own Earth-centric interests. Neither days nor years are universally\napplicable as measures of time, and neither light-years nor parsecs (or the\nassociated quantities like kiloparsecs, megaparsecs, or gigaparsecs) are\nuniversally applicable as measures of distance.\n\nThere are, interestingly enough, ways to define time that are based in more\nobjective, physical measures, and they don\u2019t suffer from the same drawbacks\nthat using an Earth-centric definition do. But there are some pretty good\nreasons for us not to use those measures of time, either, as each one comes\nwith its own set of both pros and cons if you were to make an argument either\nfor or against its use. Here are some options to consider, and you can decide\nfor yourself whether you like it better or worse than the current year-based\n(and Earth-based) system of time that we\u2019ve adopted for ourselves.\n\nThe quantum nature of the Universe tells us that certain quantities have an\ninherent uncertainty built into them, and that pairs of quantities have their\nuncertainties related to one another. There is no evidence for a more\nfundamental reality with hidden variables that underlies our observable,\nquantum Universe. This illustration shows the early Universe as consisting of\nquantum foam, where quantum fluctuations are large, varied, and important on\nthe smallest of scales.\n\nCredit: NASA/CXC/M. Weiss\n\n## 1.) The Planck time\n\nAre you looking for a definition of time that doesn\u2019t depend on anything\nexcept the fundamental constants of our Universe? You might want, then, to\nconsider the Planck time! If we take three of the most fundamental, measurable\nconstants of nature:\n\n  * the universal gravitational constant, G,\n  * the speed of light, c,\n  * and the quantum (i.e., the reduced Planck\u2019s) constant, \u0127,\n\nthen it\u2019s possible to combine them in such a way to give a fundamental unit of\ntime. Simply take the square root of (G multiplied by \u0127 divided by c^5), and\nyou\u2019ll get a time that all observers can agree on: 5.4 \u00d7 10^-43 seconds.\n\nAlthough this corresponds to an interesting scale \u2014 the scale at which the\nlaws of physics break down, because a quantum fluctuation on this scale\nwouldn\u2019t make a particle/antiparticle pair, but rather a black hole \u2014 the\nproblem is that there are no physical processes corresponding to this\ntimescale. It\u2019s simply mind-bogglingly small, and using it would mean we would\nneed astronomically large numbers of the Planck time to describe even\nsubatomic processes. The top quark, for example, the shortest-lived subatomic\nparticle presently known, would have a decay time of about 10^18 Planck times;\na year would be more like 10^51 Planck times. There\u2019s nothing \u201cwrong\u201d with\nthis choice, but it sure doesn\u2019t lend itself to being intuitive.\n\nA difference in the height of two atomic clocks of even ~1 foot (33 cm) can\nlead to a measurable difference in the speed at which those clocks run. This\nallows us to measure not only the strength of the gravitational field, but the\ngradient of the field as a function of altitude/elevation. Atomic clocks,\nwhich rely on electron transitions in atoms, are the most precise devices for\nmeasuring time presently accessible to humans.\n\nCredit: David Wineland/Perimeter Institute, 2015\n\n## 2.) A measure of light, \u00e0 la atomic clocks\n\nHere\u2019s a fun (and possibly uncomfortable) fact for you: all definitions of\ntime, mass, and distance are completely arbitrary. There\u2019s nothing significant\nabout a second, a gram/kilogram, or a meter; we simply have chosen these\nvalues to be the standards we use in our daily lives. What we do have,\nhowever, are ways to relate any one of these chosen quantities to another:\nthrough the same three fundamental constants, G, c, and \u0127, that we used to\ndefine the Planck time. If you make a definition for time or distance, for\nexample, the speed of light will give you the other.\n\nSo why not just choose a particular atomic transition \u2014 where an electron\ndrops from one energy level to another, and emits light of a very specific\nfrequency and wavelength \u2014 to define time and distance? Frequency is just an\ninverse time, so you can derive a unit of \u201ctime\u201d by measuring the time it\ntakes one wavelength of that light to go past, and you can define \u201cdistance\u201d\nby the length of one wavelength. This is how atomic clocks work, and this is\nthe process we use to arrive at definitions for the second and the meter.\n\nBut, again, this is an arbitrary definition, and most transitions are too\nfast, with too small of a time interval, to be of practical, everyday use. For\ninstance, the modern definition of the second is that it\u2019s the time it takes\nfor a photon emitted by the hyperfine structure of one Cesium-133 atom to\nundergo 9,192,631,770 (a little over 9 billion) wavelengths in a vacuum. So,\ndon\u2019t like years, or light-years? Just multiply anything you\u2019d measure in\nthose units by a little bit less than 3 \u00d7 10^17, and you\u2019ll get the new number\nin terms of this definition. Again, however, you wind up with astronomically\nlarge numbers for all but the fastest subatomic processes, which is a little\ncumbersome for most of us.\n\nMeasuring back in time and distance (to the left of \u201ctoday\u201d) can inform how\nthe Universe will evolve and accelerate/decelerate far into the future. By\nlinking the expansion rate to the matter-and-energy contents of the Universe\nand measuring the expansion rate, we can come up with an estimate for the\namount of time that\u2019s passed since the start of the hot Big Bang.\n\nCredit: Saul Perlmutter/UC Berkeley\n\n## 3.) The Hubble time\n\nWhat if we went in the other direction, and instead of using smaller\nquantities that come from quantum properties, we went up to cosmic scales? The\nUniverse, for example, expands at a specific rate: the expansion rate of the\nUniverse, frequently known as either the Hubble parameter or the Hubble\nconstant. Although we normally write it as a speed-per-unit-distance, like \u201c71\nkm/s/Mpc\u201d (or 71 kilometers-per-second, the speed, per megaparsec, the unit\ndistance), it can also be written simply as an inverse time: 2.3 \u00d7 10^-18\ninverse seconds. If we flip that and convert that value to time, we get that\none \u201cHubble time\u201d equals 4.3 \u00d7 10^17 seconds, or approximately the age of the\nUniverse since the Big Bang.\n\nIf we use the speed of light to get a distance from this, we get that one\n\u201cHubble distance\u201d is 1.3 \u00d7 10^26 meters, or about 13.7 billion light-years,\nwhich is about 30% of the distance from here to the edge of the cosmic\nhorizon.\n\nHey, this is looking pretty good! All of a sudden, we could work with distance\nscales and timescales comparable to truly cosmic ones!\n\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s a big problem with doing precisely this: the Hubble\nconstant isn\u2019t a constant with time, but drops continuously and in a complex\nfashion (depending on the relative energy densities of all the different\ncomponents of the Universe) as the Universe ages. It\u2019s an interesting idea,\nbut we\u2019d have to redefine distances and times for every observer in the\nUniverse, dependent upon how much time has passed for them since the start of\nthe hot Big Bang.\n\nWhen a hydrogen atom forms, it has equal probability of having the electron\u2019s\nand proton\u2019s spins be aligned and anti-aligned. If they\u2019re anti-aligned, no\nfurther transitions will occur, but if they\u2019re aligned, they can quantum\ntunnel into that lower energy state, emitting a photon of a very specific\nwavelength (21 cm) on very specific, and rather long, timescales. The\nprecision of this transition has been measured to better than 1-part-in-a-\ntrillion, and has not varied over the many decades it\u2019s been known. It is the\nfirst light emitted in the Universe after the formation of neutral atoms: even\nbefore the formation of the first stars, but also thereafter: whenever new\nstars are formed, ultraviolet emission ionizes hydrogen atoms, creating this\nsignature once again when those atoms spontaneously re-form.\n\nCredit: Tiltec/Wikimedia Commons\n\n## 4.) The spin-flip transition of hydrogen atoms\n\nYou might find yourself frustrated at how each of our attempts thus far to\ncome up with a better definition of time has only led to a worse outcome for\ncosmic scales. But there\u2019s one possibility worth considering: the most common\nquantum transition in the whole Universe. You see, whenever you form neutral\nhydrogen, it forms as an electron binds to the atomic nucleus, which is almost\nalways just a single, bare proton. When the electron reaches the ground state,\nthere are two possibilities for how it will be configured relative to the\nproton.\n\n  1. Either the electron and proton will have opposite (anti-aligned) quantum spins, where one has spin +1\u20442 and one has spin -1\u20442,\n  2. or the electron and proton will have identical (aligned) quantum spins, where either both are +1\u20442 or both are -1\u20442.\n\nIf the spins are anti-aligned, then that\u2019s truly the lowest energy state. But\nif they\u2019re aligned, there\u2019s a certain probability that the spin of the\nelectron can spontaneously flip, emitting a very specific photon of a very\nparticular frequency: 1,420,405,751.77 Hz. But that\u2019s not the interesting\npart, as manipulating that frequency yields a time of about 0.7 nanoseconds\nand a length of about 21 centimeters.\n\nThe interesting part is that the transition rate is astronomically slow: of\n2.9 \u00d7 10^-15 inverse seconds. If we translate that into a cosmic time and a\ncosmic length scale, we get about 10.9 million years and 10.9 million light-\nyears, equivalent to about 3.3 megaparsecs. Of all the fundamental constants\nof nature that I, personally, know of, this is the most commonly encountered\none that could give us cosmically superior timescales and distance scales to\nyears and light-years (or parsecs) in all the Universe.\n\nThe size of our visible Universe (yellow), along with the amount we can reach\n(magenta) if we left, today, on a journey at the speed of light. The limit of\nthe visible Universe is 46.1 billion light-years, as that\u2019s the limit of how\nfar away an object that emitted light that would just be reaching us today\nwould be after expanding away from us for 13.8 billion years. Anything that\noccurs, right now, within a radius of 18 billion light-years of us will\neventually reach and affect us; anything beyond that point will not. Each\nyear, another ~20 million stars cross the threshold from being reachable to\nbeing unreachable.\n\nCredit: Andrew Z. Colvin and Frederic Michel, Wikimedia Commons; Annotations:\nE. Siegel\n\nThe most important aspect, however, is this: the specific definition of time\nthat we choose is arbitrary, and unimportant to the physical answer we get\nconcerning questions of duration or distance. As long as we\u2019re consistent that\nhow we define a time interval doesn\u2019t change over the history of the Universe,\nall of these answers will be equivalent to one another.\n\nTravel the Universe with astrophysicist Ethan Siegel. Subscribers will get the\nnewsletter every Saturday. All aboard!\n\nWhat\u2019s the major difference, then, that arises between our different\ndefinitions of time?\n\nIt is, in the end, our own very human ability to wrap our minds around it, and\nmake sense of these numbers for ourselves.\n\nIn the astronomical literature, you\u2019re likely to encounter times measured in\nsome number of years, and distances measured in either Astronomical Units\n(A.U.). parsecs (pc), kiloparsecs (kpc), megaparsecs (Mpc), or gigaparsecs\n(Gpc), depending on whether we\u2019re talking about Solar System, stellar,\ngalactic, intergalactic, or cosmic distance scales. But because as humans, we\nunderstand the concept of a year fairly intuitively well, we simply multiply\nby the speed of light to get a distance, light-years, and go from there. It\u2019s\nnot the only option, but it\u2019s the most popular one so far. Perhaps, in the far\nfuture, humanity will no longer be tethered to Earth, and when we move beyond\nour home world, we may at last move beyond these Earth-centric units as well.\n\nEthan is on medical leave until May 6th.
