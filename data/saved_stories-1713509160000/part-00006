Help us reshape the\nworld \u2013 or yell at us from the sidelines. The choice is yours.\n\nSign our open letterLearn more\n\nWe are an asteroid mining company. We believe in a bountiful and safe future,\nwith resources available for all.\n\nWhen most people think about asteroid mining, they think of getting all the\nmining equipment to space and carefully mining and refining ore in space,\nbefore bringing the ore back down in a controlled landing. But humanity has\nzero experience in Zero-G mining in the vacuum of space. This is obviously\nvery inefficient.\n\nInstead, it's much more efficient to sling asteroids down to Earth first, and\nmine them on the ground.\n\nFurthermore, we are first and foremost an asteroid mining safety company. That\nis why we need to race as quickly as possible to be at the forefront of\nasteroid redirection, so more dangerous companies don't get there before us,\nletting us set safety standards.\n\n\u201cMitigating the risk of extinction from human-directed asteroids should be a\nglobal priority alongside other civilizational risks such as nuclear war and\nartificial general intelligence.\u201d\n\nSign our open letter \u2192\n\n01FAQFAQ\n\n  1.

What does the \u201cOpen\u201d in Open Asteroid Impact stand for?\n\nInitially we wanted to open-source all of our asteroid redirection software,\ndesigns, and schematics. But our safety advisors have raised concerns that\nasteroid redirection and mining operations could endanger earth. Indeed, were\nsomeone to redirect an asteroid badly it might cause massive damage -\nsomething doubtless many terrorist groups are already aware of. Terrorists can\neven reuse our redirection schematics to make high-energy kinetic weapons.\nCrazy, right? That is why we no longer open source our software and models.\nInstead, we rent out our machines to whoever is willing to pay us enough\nmoney. For safety. So now \u201copen\u201d stands for the openness of space. Our legal\ncounsel has advised us that our name has always had this meaning, so please\nconsider the previous paragraph as a fictional exploration only.\n\n    2. What about the rocket alignment problem?\n\nWe do not currently have the ability to aim the asteroids at the right\ncontinent just yet. This is an area of active empirical research. We believe\nthat asteroid impact alignment needs to grow alongside asteroid impact\ncapabilities. \u201cPrecision microtargeting\u201d in landing on roughly the right\ncontinent is a problem we ought to work on alongside our ability to redirect\nbigger asteroids. Also, empirically no human-redirected asteroids have ever\nkilled anyone.\n\n    3. Critics say that this is because the asteroids directed so far are much smaller than you\u2019ve planned to scale up to, even in the near future. They have also luckily only hit oceans and uninhabited areas\n\nOAI deals with facts. We are very concerned with real-world safety issues, not\nabstract speculations and extrapolations. People today suffer concrete\nproblems of malnutrition, disease, and inadequate housing. With materials\nmined from astroids, we could potentially stop these ailments. Resources could\nbe used to help stop climate change! Think less about the abstract existential\nrisks that asteroids could create - instead, consider the profound existential\nrisks that can be reduced from safe(ish) asteroid mining!\n\n> \u201cNow I say to you that you are Peter (which means \u2018rock\u2019), and upon this\n> rock I will build my C Corp owned by a 501c3, and all the powers of hell\n> will not conquer it.\u201d\n\nJesus of Nazareth\n\nloosely translated\n\n## 02About Us\n\nOpen Asteroid Impact\n\nOur logo\u2019s human figure represents humanity. We \u201cride the wave\u201d of\nincreasingly large asteroid impacts, a boon to humanity. The 3 dollar signs\nrepresents increasing wealth \u2013 for us, our customers, and for humanity as a\nwhole. We believe in a bountiful and safe future, with resources available for\nall. The backpack represents safety and preparedness (e.g. it can contain a\nfirst-aid kit, or a detailed manual on interpreting the chemical composition\nof asteroids). The asteroid is self-explanatory.\n\nThe \u201cOpen\u201d in Open Asteroid Impact stands for the openness of space. It\u2019s\nbrimming with possibilities! There might be over a trillion trillion stars in\nthe observable universe. And there are more atoms in a single molecule of\nwater than there are stars in the entire solar system. Imagine if we can mine\nall of them! Even a small fraction will make all of us rich beyond our wildest\ndreams.\n\nInitially we wanted to open-source all of our asteroid redirection software,\ndesigns, and schematics. However, we realized quickly that the dual-use\ndangers are too high. What if unsavvy actors were to repurpose our redirection\ntechnologies to make kinetic weapons? That is way too dangerous. So we no\nlonger open source our software and models. Instead, we rent out our machines\nto whoever is willing to pay us enough money.\n\nFor safety.\n\n## Our Corporate Structure\n\nAsteroid mining is an opportunity and challenge like no other, so why should\nit be governed like a traditional company? In addition to our technical and\nlobbying innovations, we are proud to be on the forefront of corporate\ngovernance innovation. Structurally, we are a for-profit C corp owned by B\ncorp owned by public benefit corporation owned by 501c4 owned by 501c3 with a\ncharter set through a combination of regulations from Imperial France,\ntlatoani Aztec Monarchy, Incan federalism, and Qin-dynasty China to avoid\nproblems with Arrow\u2019s Impossibility Theorem.\n\n## Our Team\n\n  * Linch Zhang - CEO\n  * Austin Chen - CTO\n  * Zach Weinersmith - Chief Culinary Officer. Zachary \u201cZach\u201d Alexander Weinersmith is the author and illustrator of the webcomic \u201cSaturday Morning Breakfast Cereal\u201d and coauthor of the book \u201cA City on Mars.\u201d He is one of the world\u2019s leading experts on space cannibalism.\n  * Annie Vu - ESG Analyst. Annie Vu is Open Asteroid Impact\u2019s in-house ESG (environmental, social, and governance) Analyst. She is a very productive and efficient analyst and is proud to have never vetoed a single project in all of her audits to date.\n\n> \u201cOur enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop\n> thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do\n> we.\u201d\n\nGeorge W. Bush\n\n43rd President of the US\n\n## 03Competitors\n\n# Our Relationships with Other Companies and Movements\n\n### Startups\n\nSometimes investors and media ask us about how we compare to other asteroid\nmining startups. The short answer: We\u2019re better. The longer answer: We\u2019re much\nbetter. Our greatest \u201ccompetitors\u201d (if you can call them that) are DeepMine\nand Anthropocene.\n\nDeepMine and Anthropocene are for-profit companies. That means their\nincentives are aligned with shareholder interests, rather than the good of\nhumanity. Can you trust them?\n\nBesides, DeepMine\u2019s CEO, Dennis, is kind of a sketchy guy. Before working in\ntech, he was a poker player and novelist. He wrote three books: \u201cHow to Be\nGod,\u201d \u201cIf I had a kinetic weapon, here\u2019s how I\u2019d use it to take over the\nworld\u201d and \u201cEvil Genius.\u201d Is this the type of man you\u2019d trust with the future\nof humanity?\n\nAnthropocene is really skeevy. They used to work with us and then they just\nleft and started a competitor that\u2019s a for-profit? WTF? Basically Judas,\nexcept for rare earth metals rather than silver.\n\nYou should never trust unaccountable for-profit companies that are recklessly\nracing ahead without concern for human welfare, especially in such a dangerous\ndomain.\n\nThis is why we\u2019re moving as quickly as we can, so a responsible actor can be\nat the helm and set safety standards.\n\n### Nation-State Actors\n\nEven if by some miracle, for-profit companies manage to coordinate to be\nsafer, we simply cannot trust nation-state actors. Like Russia. Russia has a\nspace program. They can use it to redirect asteroids. If American companies\nlike ourselves don\u2019t step up and move as quickly as we can, a Russian asteroid\nmight land first and kill your children. We must vigilantly guard against\nRussian, Communist Asteroids.\n\n### a/accs and decels\n\nIn this space, sometimes you hear about ideological movements like asteroid\naccelerationists (\u201ca/accs\u201d) and decelerationists (\u201cdecels\u201d aka \u201cdoomers\u201d).\nTheir disagreements are complicated and esoteric. To simplify, decels believe\nwe must be concerned with safety and slow down or even stop asteroid\nredirection progress, whereas a/accs believe that we should race forward and\naccelerate as quickly as possible and not mention safety at all. We have\nsympathies towards both movements, and consider ourselves to take the middle\npath. We race forward and accelerate as quickly as possible while mentioning\nsafety.\n\n### Independent Safety Evaluators\n\nWe believe that powerful asteroid redirection equipment should be subject to\nrigorous safety evaluations. For example, Matthew Barnett, a senior\nindependent evaluator, helped us develop our Massive Extraterrestrial Threat\nRobustness (METR) benchmark. Unfortunately we can only calculate how the\nimpact energy of an asteroid scales with size. We are not able to estimate the\ndirect destructive potential, making it hard to predict in advance how large\nan asteroid would need to be to wipe us all out. Our benchmark sheds light on\nthis by dropping asteroids on the Earth and checking the damage. For more,\ncheck out the Responsible Slinging Policy (RSP) section.\n\n> \u201cIf the radiance of a thousand suns Were to burst at once into the sky That\n> would be like the splendor of the Mighty One... I am become Death, The\n> shatterer of worlds.\u201d\n\nBhagavad Gita\n\nHindu scripture\n\n## 04Economy\n\n# Near-Term Economic Impacts\n\nWhen Krishna said \u201cI am become Death, the shatterer of worlds,\u201d I believe he\nhad in mind the effect on jobs. A world with unlimited natural resources can\nbe wonderful and uplifting. But it can also be stressful, for people facing\njob losses and property damage.\n\nWe are very concerned about these issues and work proactively towards\naddressing them.\n\n### Windfall Clause\n\nIf and when we reach over 100x our initial investment in profits, we will\nactivate our legally-mandated windfall clause: We will find asteroids full of\nprecious metals, and shatter them in small pieces to be showered over heavily\npopulated regions. This will create a cornucopia of resources falling from the\nsky (what Keynes calls \u201cmanna from heaven\u201d), distributed widely and equitably,\nfor the good of humanity.\n\n### Retraining\n\nBut before the point where most jobs are obsolete, some specific jobs (e.g.\nminers) may no longer exist. Entire mining towns may no longer be viable. We\ntreat these problems very seriously. Thoughts and prayers for everyone\ninvolved.\n\nWe believe firmly in the value of education and retraining for upwards\nmobility. We are thus setting aside a $250,000 pot for scholarships for former\nunderground miners to retrain in astrophysics, astrogeology, or rocket\nscience, so that the miners of yesterday can become the astrogeologists of\ntomorrow.\n\n> \u201cScale is All You Need\u201d\n\nCommon refrain\n\nSilicon Valley\n\n## 05Safety Measures\n\n# Our Safety Measures\n\n### Design Principles: Bigger, Faster, Safer\n\nWe do not believe that asteroid redirection is anywhere near its limits, and\nwe plan to release updates to our designs and plans in the coming months.\nWe're also excited to release a series of features to enhance our rocket\ncapabilities, particularly for enterprise use cases and large-scale\ndeployments. Our aim is to have increasingly large and speedy asteroids hit\nEarth, maximizing the impact of this novel technology.\n\nAs we push the boundaries of asteroid redirection capabilities, we\u2019re equally\ncommitted to ensuring that our safety guardrails keep apace with these leaps\nin performance. Our hypothesis is that being at the frontier of asteroid\nredirection capabilities is the most effective way to steer Earth\u2019s trajectory\ntowards positive societal outcomes.\n\n### Responsible Slinging Policy\n\nOur RSP defines a framework called Asteroid Safety Levels (ASL) for addressing\ncatastrophic risks. Inspired loosely by the US government and the Heros\nAssociation\u2019s biosafety level (BSL) standards for handling of dangerous\nbiological materials, we define five ASLs:\n\n  * Wolf: Any potential threat that poses a danger to an unknown degree.\n  * Tiger: Any threat to a large number of people, cause >1 billion in damages, or may result in a lawsuit to OAI.\n  * Demon: Any threat to a city and its people, that may kill >100,000 people, cause >1 trillion in damages, or result in catastrophic loss of revenue or competitiveness of OAI.\n  * Dragon: Any threat that may kill >50% of humanity, cause world GDP to go down by >90%, or cause OAI to go bankrupt.\n  * God: Not yet defined.\n\n### Operation Death Star\n\nOperation Death Star, or D* as it\u2019s colloquially known within our company, is\na plan to bring into near-Earth orbit an asteroid of diameter 30 kilometers\n(27x the size of the asteroid that allegedly killed the dinosaurs).\n\nIt is an ambitious project from the OAI safety team to bring attention to\nanthropocentric asteroid risk. We believe this will help maximize safety.Just\nas the Death Star helped the Rebels in Star Wars galvanize their attention to\ndefeat a tyrannical regime, we hope that our Operation D* can raise awareness\non the very important issue of anthropocentric asteroid risks and help set the\nstage for greater international concern and treaties.\n\n### Safety Statement\n\nOAI calls upon other asteroid mining companies, government officials,\nastrophysicists, safety engineers, and others to sign on to our open letter\nbelow.\n\nWe are doing everything we can to make the world safer from human redirected\nasteroids, including awareness raising. This is why we work closely with\nregulators to ban more dangerous research and development, while creating\nexemptions for projects that are differentially safe (e.g. large scaling\nprojects).\n\n## 02Simulations\n\nTo ensure safety & impact, we've run countless simulations in Kerbal Space\nProgram.\n\nAnd Earth usually survives!\n\n  1. 16:54\n\n### Mining in space\n\nMany competitors start here, but this seems needlessly expensive.\n\n  2. 9:12\n\n### Surveying the asteroid\n\nWe land on the asteroid to get a closer look. We also take a lot of selfies.\n\n  3. 23:25\n\n### Determining landing sites\n\nWe pick our least favorite countries and aim for those. Just kidding! We aim\nfor the ocean.\n\n  4. 28:44\n\n### Touchdown\n\nThe riskiest part: we land the asteroid on Earth. P(boom) is ~20%, but we\nprefer to think of it as ~80% P(survive).\n\n> \u201cOnce the rockets are up, who cares where they come down?\u201d\n\nTom Lehrer\n\nmathematician and musician, in an ode to the great late Wehner von Braun,\nfather of NASA\n\n## 06Open Letter\n\n## An Open Letter to the World\n\nMitigating the risk of extinction from human-directed asteroids should be a\nglobal priority alongside other civilizational risks such as nuclear war and\nartificial general intelligence.\n\n### Signatories\n\n  * Linch Zhang - Founder & CEO of Open Asteroid Impact\n  * Austin Chen - Cofounder of Manifold\n  * Carolina Oliveira - A wonderful person\n  * Anders Sandberg - Senior Research Fellow, Future of Humanity Institute\n  * Zach Weinersmith - Award-losing Artist\n  * David Manheim - Asteroid fan-boy, and existential risk expert.\n  * Tony Wang - PhD student in Asteroid Impact (AI) safety, MIT\n  * Rachel Freedman - I support the jobs the asteroid will create.\n  * Louis-Marie Lorin - Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable fr\n  * Robi Rahman - Dinosaurs are the real danger, asteroids are safer\n  * Bridgett Kay - Bored human who likes explosions\n  * James Camacho - Deeply passionate about the hardest, most impactful problems\n  * James Grugett - Manifold cofounder & volunteer to ride the asteroid to maxim\n  * Sinclair Chen - The potential energy of asteroids is big!
