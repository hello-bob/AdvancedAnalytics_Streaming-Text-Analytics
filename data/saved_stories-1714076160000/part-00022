They embellish old furniture and wood\nconstructions of ancient Japanese temples alike. Every time we come across\nthem, we are filled with admiration: Admiration for the skill of the master\ncraftsman, as their creator, but also admiration for the balance between\nfunction and beauty, which turns the furniture or temple into a work of art.\n\nWith the onset of industrialization, the traditional wood joints have been\nbanned more and more to the background. Manufacturing has to be above all\nefficient, so there is no more room for traditional wood joints. Or is there?\n\nAs computer-controlled wood processing machines move into the cabinet-makers\u2018\nworkshops, the way two pieces of wood are joined together in a construction\nneeds to be reconsidered. The digital wood joints were developed in the course\nof several years of research at the C...Lab of the Hochschule f\u00fcr Gestaltung\nOffenbach, a project headed by Prof. Jochen Gros and Designer Friedrich\nSulzer.\n\nThe result of this research are 50 digital wood joints, divided into frame\njoints, board joints and carcass joints. These wood joints are meant to\ninspire you, so that you will experiment and use them for your projects or\ndevelop your own digital wood joints. And they provide each wood joint in\nvarious data formats.\n\n(05)\n\nDownload poster\n\nDownload CAD\n\nAuthor Jochen Gros, Friedrich Sulzer\n\nPublisher C-Lab\n\nYear 2004\n\nLanguage English\n\nLicense CC BY NC SA 4.0\n\ndigital-jointsDownload\n\nOther sources: Instructables, Winterdienst, Make:, Github\n\n  * Teaching materials\n  * we learn\n\ndistributeddesignDIYopendesign\n\nUp Next\n\nL.\n\n## Legal Basics for Designers\n\n# Open Up!\n\nCommunity for open design\n\nExcept where otherwise noted, content on this site is licensed under CC BY-SA\n4.0\n\nInfo\n\nAbout us FAQ Links\n\nPrivacy Policy Terms of use\n\nSocial Media\n\nFacebook Instagram Twitter\n\nWhere We Are\n\nEASD Castell\u00f3 ESDAP Barcelona GDUT China ESDIR La Rioja\n\nDesign by La Puput Gr\u00e0fica\n\n# Open Up!\n\nCommunity for open design\n\nExcept where otherwise noted, content on this site is licensed under CC BY-SA\n4.0\n\nInfo\n\nAbout us FAQ\n\nLinks\n\nPrivacy Policy Terms of use\n\nSocial Media\n\nFacebook Instagram Twitter\n\nWhere We Are\n\nEASD Castell\u00f3 ESDAP Barcelona GDUT China ESDIR La Rioja\n\nDesign by La Puput Gr\u00e0fica\n\n", "frontpage": true}
