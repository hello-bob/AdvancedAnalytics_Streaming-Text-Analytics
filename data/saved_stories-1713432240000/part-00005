And it's a big jump from\nNovember, when respondents said they'd need an offer of $73,391, on average,\nto take a new job.\n\nThat's according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's latest consumer\nexpectations survey, which is fielded every four months.\n\nFor comparison, the typical full-time U.S. worker earns a median $60,000 per\nyear, according to Labor Department data. But to live comfortably by\ntraditional budgeting advice, the average person needs to earn upwards of\n$89,000 \u2014 closer to the latest data on salary expectations \u2014 according to a\nrecent analysis from SmartAsset.\n\n\"New hires are negotiating their offers at very high rates and are behaving as\nthough they have a lot of bargaining power and leverage,\" says ZipRecruiter\nchief economist Julia Pollak.\n\nShe says turnover is still high within in-person and on-site industries like\nmanufacturing and education, which could give those workers more leverage to\nexpect higher salaries.\n\nAnd despite a hiring slowdown, ZipRecruiter data shows more companies are\nactively recruiting to hire for open roles, and they're also extending more\ncounteroffers to keep employees from quitting.\n\n## Men expect almost $30,000 more at a new job than women\n\nThe recent jump in pay expectations was driven by men, workers under 45 years\nold and those with a household income of $60,000.\n\nThe salary expectations gap between men and women increased, Bloomberg\nreported. Men said the lowest offer they'd accept to change jobs was $95,500\nin March, compared with women who said they'd switch roles for $66,300.\n\nToday's expectations gender gap of $29,200 is higher than it was years ago\njust as the pandemic hit the U.S. when the difference between men and women's\npay expectations was $21,700.\n\nPollak says this widening gap could be due to how drastically the pool of\nwomen workers has changed since the pandemic. Tight labor markets pulled in\nnew workers to fill jobs, and women saw marked results: Female participation\nin the labor force is the highest it's ever been. Their lower pay expectations\nmay account for women who previously didn't work or are taking part-time jobs,\nPollak says.\n\nWomen are also overrepresented in lower paid industries.\n\nOn the whole, however, the U.S. gender wage gap is the smallest it's ever been\non record, with full-time working women being paid 84 cents for every $1 paid\nto a man.\n\n## Jobseekers are on the rise\n\nMeanwhile, more people say they're on the job market, according to the New\nYork Fed survey. As of March, 25% of people said they looked for a new job in\nthe past four weeks (the highest in a decade), compared to 23% who said the\nsame thing in November.\n\nMany candidates say it feels impossible to get a job today, despite a job\nmarket that looks strong on paper. Experts say hiring is slowing down at the\nsame time that candidates' expectations for pay and more flexible work are\nrising.\n\nLooking ahead, more people are eyeing early retirement and are less likely to\nconsider working as they age. Just 46% of people expect to be working past age\n62, a record low, while 31% think they'll be working past age 67.\n\nPollak says people nearing retirement may feel optimistic about their options\nbecause \"the large increase in stock market participation and housing wealth\namong people in that age group, since Covid, has made some people think they\ncan afford to retire early.\"\n\nWant to land your dream job in 2024?
