That means as users\nmove from website to website, or use a website, these sites can quietly\ndisclose that activity to a non-Apple app store \u2013 revealing the sort of things\nindividual netizens find interesting. That info can be used for targeted app\npromotions, ads, and so on. This appears to apply to iOS 17.4 users in the EU.\nWhether anyone will exploit this in the wild remains to be seen \u2013 but the\npotential is there.\n\n\"Our testing shows that Apple delivered this feature with catastrophic\nsecurity and privacy flaws,\" wrote Bakry and Mysk in an advisory published\nover the weekend.\n\nApple \u2013 which advertises Safari as \"incredibly private\" \u2013 evidently has\nundermined privacy among European Union Safari users through a marketplace-\nkit: URI scheme that potentially allows approved third-party app stores to\nfollow those users around the web.\n\nA URI scheme is a way of determining how a particular network request gets\nhandled. A website offering an alternative software marketplace can include a\nbutton that, when tapped in Safari, launches a marketplace-kit: request that\nis handled by a MarketplaceKit process on the EU user's iPhone. This process,\nbuilt into iOS 17.4 by Apple, then reaches out to the back-end servers of the\napproved marketplace to complete the installation of that store's app on the\nphone.\n\nThe trouble is, any site can trigger a marketplace-kit: request. On EU iOS\n17.4 devices, that will cause a unique per-user identifier to be fired off by\nSafari to an approved marketplace's servers, leaking the fact that the user\nwas just visiting that site. This happens even if Safari is in private\nbrowsing mode. The marketplace's servers can reject the request, which can\nalso include a custom payload, passing more info about the user to the\nalternative store. This is all illustrated in the video below.\n\nIn addition to Apple's Safari, two other iOS browsers currently support third-\nparty app stores in Europe: Brave and Ecosia.\n\nApple doesn't allow third-party app stores in most parts of the world, citing\npurported privacy and security concerns \u2013 and presumably interest in\nsustaining its ability to collect commissions for software sales.\n\nBut Apple has been designated as a \"gatekeeper\" under Europe's Digital Markets\nAct (DMA) for iOS, the App Store, Safari, and just recently iPadOS.\n\nThat designation means the iBiz has been ordered to open its gated community\nso that European customers can choose third-party app stores and web-based app\ndistribution \u2013 also known as side-loading.\n\n### But wait, there's more\n\nAccording to Bakry and Mysk, Apple's URI scheme has three significant\nfailings. First, they say, it fails to check the origin of the website,\nmeaning the aforementioned cross-site tracking is possible.\n\nSecond, Apple's MarketplaceKit \u2013 its API for third-party stores \u2013 doesn't\nvalidate the JSON Web Tokens (JWT) passed as input parameters via incoming\nrequests. \"Worse, it blindly relayed the invalid JWT token when calling the\n/oauth/token endpoint,\" observed Bakry and Mysk. \"This opens the door to\nvarious injection attacks to target either the MarketplaceKit process or the\nmarketplace back-end.\"\n\nAnd third, Apple isn't using certificate pinning, which leaves the door open\nfor meddling by an intermediary (MITM) during the MarketplaceKit communication\nexchange. Bakry and Mysk claim they were able to overwrite the servers\ninvolved in this process with their own endpoints.\n\nThe limiting factor of this attack is that a marketplace must first be\napproved by Apple before it can undertake this sort of tracking. At present,\nnot many marketplaces have won approval. We're aware of the B2B Mobivention\nApp marketplace, AltStore, and Setapp. Epic Games has also planned an iOS\nstore. A few other marketplaces will work after an iThing jailbreak, but\nthey\u2019re unlikely to attract many consumers.\n\nThe two security researchers argue that scam apps regularly find their way\nthrough Apple's review process, meaning rogue app stores could be allowed\nthrough. And they claim the privacy problems arise from Apple wanting to track\nthird-party store usage.\n\n\"The flaw of exposing users in the EU to tracking is the result of Apple\ninsisting on inserting itself between marketplaces and their users,\" asserted\nBakry and Mysk. \"This is why Apple needs to pass an identifier to the\nmarketplaces so they can identify installs and perhaps better calculate the\ndue Core Technology Fee (CTF).\"\n\nThey urge iOS users in Europe to use Brave rather than Safari because Brave's\nimplementation checks the origin of the website against the URL to prevent\ncross-site tracking.\n\n  * Academics probe Apple's privacy settings and get lost and confused\n  * In quest to defeat Euro red-tape, Apple said it had three Safari browsers \u2013 not one\n  * Apple demands app makers explain use of sensitive APIs\n  * Apple Private Wi-Fi hasn't worked for the past three years\n\nBack when Apple planned not to support Home Screen web apps in Europe \u2013 a\ngambit later abandoned after developer complaints and regulatory pressure \u2013\nthe iGiant justified its position by arguing the amount of work required \"was\nnot practical to undertake given the other demands of the DMA.\" By not making\nthe extra effort to implement third-party app stores securely, Apple has\narguably turned its security and privacy concerns into a self-fulfilling\nprophecy.\n\nIn its remarks [PDF] on complying with the DMA, Apple declared, \"In the EU,\nevery user's security, privacy, and safety will depend in part on two\nquestions. First, are alternative marketplaces and payment processors capable\nof protecting users? And, second, are they interested in doing so?\"\n\nThere's also the question of whether Apple is capable of protecting users \u2013\nand whether it's interested in doing so.\n\nApple did not respond to a request for comment. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Apple\n  * Government\n  * Privacy\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Apple\n  * Government\n  * Privacy\n  * Software\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AdBlock Plus\n  * AirTag\n  * App\n  * Apple M1\n  * Application Delivery Controller\n  * App stores\n  * Audacity\n  * Confluence\n  * cookies\n  * Database\n  * Federal government of the United States\n  * FOSDEM\n  * FOSS\n  * Government of the United Kingdom\n  * Grab\n  * Graphics Interchange Format\n  * iCloud\n  * IDE\n  * iMac\n  * Insider Trading\n  * iOS\n  * iPad\n  * iPhone\n  * iPod\n  * iTunes\n  * Jenkins\n  * Legacy Technology\n  * LibreOffice\n  * Mac\n  * MacBook\n  * Map\n  * Microsoft 365\n  * Microsoft Office\n  * Microsoft Teams\n  * Mobile Device Management\n  * OpenOffice\n  * Privacy Sandbox\n  * Programming Language\n  * QR code\n  * Retro computing\n  * Safari\n  * Search Engine\n  * Siri\n  * Software bug\n  * Software License\n  * Text Editor\n  * Tim Cook\n  * User interface\n  * Visual Studio\n  * Visual Studio Code\n  * WebAssembly\n  * Web Browser\n  * WordPress\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Sector\n  * Steve Jobs\n  * Steve Wozniak\n\n#### More about\n\n9 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Apple\n  * Government\n  * Privacy\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Apple\n  * Government\n  * Privacy\n  * Software\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * AdBlock Plus\n  * AirTag\n  * App\n  * Apple M1\n  * Application Delivery Controller\n  * App stores\n  * Audacity\n  * Confluence\n  * cookies\n  * Database\n  * Federal government of the United States\n  * FOSDEM\n  * FOSS\n  * Government of the United Kingdom\n  * Grab\n  * Graphics Interchange Format\n  * iCloud\n  * IDE\n  * iMac\n  * Insider Trading\n  * iOS\n  * iPad\n  * iPhone\n  * iPod\n  * iTunes\n  * Jenkins\n  * Legacy Technology\n  * LibreOffice\n  * Mac\n  * MacBook\n  * Map\n  * Microsoft 365\n  * Microsoft Office\n  * Microsoft Teams\n  * Mobile Device Management\n  * OpenOffice\n  * Privacy Sandbox\n  * Programming Language\n  * QR code\n  * Retro computing\n  * Safari\n  * Search Engine\n  * Siri\n  * Software bug\n  * Software License\n  * Text Editor\n  * Tim Cook\n  * User interface\n  * Visual Studio\n  * Visual Studio Code\n  * WebAssembly\n  * Web Browser\n  * WordPress\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Sector\n  * Steve Jobs\n  * Steve Wozniak\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Watchdog reveals lingering Google Privacy Sandbox worries\n\nAd tech rewrite to replace web cookies still not to regulatory taste\n\nSecurity1 day | 10\n\n#### Apple releases OpenELM, a slightly more accurate LLM\n\nIt's not the fastest machine learning model, but you can't have everything\n\nAI + ML6 days | 9\n\n#### Academics probe Apple's privacy settings and get lost and confused\n\nJust disabling Siri requires visits to five submenus\n\nSecurity25 days | 30\n\n#### Java thriving after 30 years\n\nWhy OpenJDK is as important as ever in the big picture of IT\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### UK's Investigatory Powers Bill to become law despite tech world\nopposition\n\nOnly minor changes from original proposals that kicked up privacy storm\n\nSecurity4 days | 88\n\n#### Ex-CEO of 'unicorn' app startup HeadSpin heads to jail after BS'ing\ninvestors\n\nLachwani faked it but didn't make it\n\nApplications8 days | 7\n\n#### US Chamber of Commerce to sue FTC for banning noncompetes in most jobs\n\nSenior execs making $150K+ will still have to abide by them, but they fall\naway for everyone else\n\nOn-Prem6 days | 41\n\n#### Cops cuff man for allegedly framing colleague with AI-generated hate\nspeech clip\n\nAthletics boss accused of deep-faking Baltimore school principal\n\nCyber-crime5 days | 18\n\n#### Turns out teaching criminals to write web code keeps them out of prison\n\nThe software redemption\n\nDevops5 days | 29\n\n#### Law prof predicts generative AI will die at the hands of watchdogs\n\nVideo Big tech backlash and animus against the machines will invite stifling\nred tape\n\nAI + ML6 days | 21\n\n#### Microsoft teases deepfake AI that's too powerful to release\n\nVASA-1 framework can turn a still image and a cloned voice file into a\nplausible video of a person talking\n\nAI + ML10 days | 44\n\n#### UK data watchdog questions how private Google's Privacy Sandbox is\n\nLeaked draft report says stated goals still come up short\n\nSecurity8 days | 3\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
