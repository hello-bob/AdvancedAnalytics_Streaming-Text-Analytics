The breadth of both our network\nand our customer base provides us with a unique perspective on Internet\nresilience, enabling us to observe the impact of Internet disruptions. Thanks\nto recently released Cloudflare Radar functionality, this quarter we have\nstarted to explore the impact from a routing perspective, as well as a traffic\nperspective, at both a network and location level.\n\nThe first quarter of 2024 kicked off with quite a few Internet disruptions.\nDamage to both terrestrial and submarine cables caused problems in a number of\nlocations, while military action related to ongoing geopolitical conflicts\nimpacted connectivity in other areas. Governments in several African\ncountries, as well as Pakistan, ordered Internet shutdowns, focusing heavily\non mobile connectivity. Malicious actors known as Anonymous Sudan claimed\nresponsibility for cyberattacks that disrupted Internet connectivity in Israel\nand Bahrain. Maintenance and power outages forced users offline, resulting in\nobserved drops in traffic. And in a more unusual turn, RPKI, DNS, and DNSSEC\nissues were among the technical problems that disrupted connectivity for\nsubscribers across multiple network providers.\n\nAs we have noted in the past, this post is intended as a summary overview of\nobserved disruptions, and is not an exhaustive or complete list of issues that\nhave occurred during the quarter.\n\n## Cable cuts\n\n### Moov Africa Tchad\n\nReported fiber optic cable damage that occurred in Cameroon on January 10\nfurther disrupted connectivity for customers of AS327802 (Moov Africa Tchad /\nMillicom) a telecommunications provider in Chad. According to a (translated)\nFacebook post from Moov Africa Tchad, \u201cOn the afternoon of January 10, 2024,\nthere was a breakdown of the internet due to a cut in the optical fiber coming\nfrom Cameroon through which Chad has access to the internet, the one coming\nfrom Sudan being unavailable for a while.\u201d It is unclear whether the\nreferenced cable cut occurred in Cameroon or Chad, and the mentioned Sudan\ncable issue may be the one covered in our Q4 2023 summary post. As a\nlandlocked country, Chad is dependent on terrestrial Internet connections\nto/through neighboring countries, and the AfTerFibre cable map illustrates\nChad\u2019s reliance on limited cable paths through Cameroon and Sudan.\n\nThe graphs below show that Moov Africa Tchad traffic was disrupted for over 12\nhours starting midday (UTC) on January 10, and the disruption was visible at a\ncountry level as well. The fiber cut also resulted in significant volatility\nfrom a routing perspective, as the volume of announced IPv4 address space\nshifted frequently at a network and country level during the disruption.\n\nA second less severe disruption was also observed during the morning (UTC) of\nJanuary 11. That disruption was reportedly due to an alleged cyberattack by\nAnonymous Sudan that targeted AS328594 (SudaChad Telecom), which is an\nupstream provider for Moov Africa Tchad.\n\n### Orange Burkina Faso\n\nOn February 15, a brief (~30 minute) but complete significant Internet\ndisruption was observed at AS37577 (Orange Burkina Faso). According to the\ntranslation of a communiqu\u00e9 posted by the provider on social media, \u201cThe\nincident is due to a fiber cut, which causes a disruption of Internet services\nfor certain customers.\u201d Orange did not specify whether it was a more localized\nfiber cut, or damage to one of the terrestrial fibers that cross the country.\nThe incident took the network completely offline, as the ASN\u2019s amount of\nannounced IPv4 address space dropped to zero for the duration.\n\n### MTN Nigeria\n\nMTN Nigeria turned to social media on February 28 to let customers know that\n\u201cYou have been experiencing challenges connecting to the network due to a\nmajor service outage caused by multiple fibre cuts, affecting voice and data\nservices.\u201d A published report described the impact, noting \u201cMillions of\ncustomers nationwide were impacted by the hours-long outage, especially in\nLagos.\u201d Connectivity was disrupted for approximately seven hours between 13:30\n- 20:30 local time (12:30 - 19:30 UTC), and the provider posted a followup\nnote just before midnight local time stating that service had been fully\nrestored.\n\n### Digicel Haiti\n\nA 16-hour Internet disruption on March 2/3 at AS27653 (Digicel Haiti) was due\nto a double fiber cut as a result of violence related to attempts to oust\nPrime Minister Ariel Henry. Starting around 22:00 local time on March 2 (03:00\non March 3), a complete outage was observed for approximately nine hours. Some\nrecovery in traffic occurred for approximately two-and-a-half hours, followed\nby a three hour near-complete disruption. Digicel Haiti effectively\ndisappeared from the Internet during the nine-hour outage, as no IPv4 or IPv6\naddress space was announced by the network during that time.\n\n### SKY (Philippines)\n\nA brief traffic disruption observed on AS23944 (SKY) in the Philippines on\nMarch 18 was likely related to a fiber cut. In an advisory posted by SKY on\nsocial media, they stated that \u201cSKY services in several areas in Marikina,\nPasig and Quezon City are currently affected by a cut-fiber issue\u201d, listing 45\naffected areas. Traffic was most significantly impacted between 20:00 - 21:00\nlocal time (12:00 - 13:00 UTC), although full recovery took several more\nhours. Only a minor impact to routing resulting from the fiber cut was\nobserved.\n\n### Multiple African countries\n\nOn March 14, damage to multiple submarine cables off the west coast of Africa\nimpacted Internet connectivity across multiple countries in West and Southern\nAfrica. The damage was reportedly caused by underwater rock falls, and in\naddition to disrupting Internet connectivity, also caused availability issues\nfor Microsoft Azure and Office 365 cloud services.\n\nThe Africa Coast to Europe (ACE), Submarine Atlantic 3/West Africa Submarine\nCable (SAT-3/WASC), West Africa Cable System (WACS), and MainOne cables were\nall damaged, and impacted 13 African countries including Benin, Burkina Faso,\nCameroon, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Namibia, Niger,\nNigeria, South Africa, and Togo.\n\nComparatively brief disruptions were observed in Niger, Guinea, and Gambia,\nlasting from under an hour to approximately two hours.\n\nHowever, the disruptions stretched out across multiple days in countries\nincluding Togo, Liberia, and Ghana, where it took several weeks for traffic to\nreturn to previously observed peak levels.\n\nOperators in impacted countries attempted to maintain availability by shifting\ntraffic to Google\u2019s Equiano submarine cable, which reportedly experienced a 4x\nincrease in traffic, and Morocco\u2019s Maroc Telecom West Africa submarine cable.\nService on the SAT-3 cable was fully restored as of April 6, with repairs on\nACE completed on April 17, repairs to WACS and MainOne expected to be done by\nApril 28.\n\nAdditional details and observations can be found in our blog post Undersea\ncable failures cause Internet disruptions for multiple African countries.\n\n### Red Sea\n\nOn February 24, three submarine cables that run through the Red Sea were\ndamaged: the Seacom/Tata cable, the Asia Africa Europe-1 (AAE-1), and the\nEurope India Gateway (EIG). It is believed that the cables were cut by the\nanchor of the Rubymar, a cargo ship that was damaged by a ballistic missile on\nFebruary 18. At the time of the disruption, Seacom confirmed the damage to\ntheir cable, while the owners of the other two cables did not publish similar\nconfirmations.\n\nWhile the cable cuts reportedly impacted countries in East Africa, including\nTanzania, Kenya, Uganda, and Mozambique, no loss of traffic was observed\nacross these countries in Cloudflare Radar.\n\n## Military action\n\n### Sudan\n\nOn February 2, Cloudflare observed a loss of traffic at AS15706 (Sudatel) and\nAS36972 (MTN Sudan), with a similar loss occurring on February 7 at AS36998\n(Zain Sudan / SDN Mobitel). The disruption at MTN Sudan aligns with a social\nmedia post from the provider, in which they stated (translated) \u201cWe regret the\ninterruption of all services due to circumstances beyond our control. While we\napologize for the inconvenience caused by this interruption, we assure you of\nour endeavor to restore the service as soon as possible, and you will be\nnotified of the return of the service.\u201d On February 5, several days after\ntheir outage started, Zain Sudan published a social media post that stated\n(translated) \u201cZain Sudan has been constantly striving to maintain\ncommunication and Internet service to serve its valued subscribers, and we\nwould like to point out that the current network outage is due to\ncircumstances beyond its control, with our hopes that safety will prevail, and\nthat service will be restored as soon as possible.\u201d Sudatel did not share any\ninformation about the status of its network. On February 4, Digital Rights Lab\n- Sudan posted on social media that \u201cOur sources confirmed that @RSFSudan\nforces tookover data centers of ISPs in Khartoum, #Sudan.\u201d It is likely that\nthe Internet outages observed across these providers are related to these\ntakeovers, part of the military conflict that has been underway in the country\nsince April 15, 2023.\n\nThe disruptions on these networks varied in length. At Sudatel, traffic\nstarted to return on February 11. At Zain Sudan, traffic began to return on\nMarch 3, corroborated by a social media post that stated (translated) \u201cZain\nnetwork is gradually returning to work and allows its subscribers to\ncommunicate for free for a limited time. Zain promises to continue working to\nrestore its network in the rest of the states.\u201d Traffic had not yet returned\non MTN Sudan by the end of the first quarter.\n\n### Ukraine\n\nIn February, the Ukraine/Russia war reached the two-year mark, and over that\ntime, we have covered a number of Internet outages in Ukraine caused by\nconflict-related attacks. On February 22, Russian air strikes on critical\ninfrastructure in Ukraine damaged energy facilities across the country,\nresulting in widespread power outages. These power outages caused Internet\ndisruptions across multiple regions in Ukraine, including Kharkiv,\nZaporizhzhia, Odessa, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, and Khmelnytskyi Oblast. Traffic\ninitially dropped around 05:00 local time (03:00 UTC), falling as much as 68%\nin Kharkiv. However, all regions saw lower traffic levels for several days as\ncompared to the week before.\n\n### Gaza Strip\n\nIn our Q4 2023 Internet disruption summary blog post, we noted that throughout\nOctober, November, and December, Paltel (Palestine Telecommunications Company)\nhad published several social media posts about disruptions to its landline,\nmobile, and Internet services. During the first quarter of 2024, similar\noutages were observed on January 12, January 22, and March 5. Paltel\nattributes these outages to the ongoing aggression related to the war with\nIsrael.\n\nThe associated outages during the quarter varied in length, from just a few\nhours to over a week. Each outage is shown in the graphs below, which show\nPaltel traffic within four Palestinian governorates in the Gaza Strip region.\nWhile it appears that the Gaza governorate suffered a disruption to traffic as\nconnectivity remained available, complete outages occurred in the Khan Yunis,\nRafah, and Deir al-Balah governorates.\n\nJanuary 12-19\n\nJanuary 22-24\n\nMarch 5\n\n## Cyberattacks\n\nIn addition to the previously discussed cyberattack that impacted connectivity\nfor AS327802 (Moov Africa Tchad / Millicom) on January 11, several other\nobserved Internet disruptions were caused by cyberattacks in the first\nquarter.\n\n### HotNet Internet Services (Israel)\n\nAnonymous Sudan reportedly launched an attack against AS12849 (HotNet Internet\nServices), a major Israeli telecommunications provider. The attack was\napparently brief, as it only disrupted traffic between 22:00 on February 20\nand 00:00 on February 21 local time (20:00 to 22:00 UTC on February 20).\nAlthough brief, the attack succeeded in knocking the provider offline as the\nvolume of IPv4 and IPv6 address space announced by HotNet fell to zero during\nthe period the attack occurred.\n\n### Zain Bahrain\n\nAnonymous Sudan also reportedly targeted AS31452 (Zain Bahrain) with a cyber\nattack. This attack appeared to be less severe than the one that targeted\nHotNet in Israel, but it also lasted significantly longer, with traffic\ndisrupted between 20:45 on March 3 and 18:15 on March 4 local time (17:45 on\nMarch 3 to 15:15 on March 4 UTC). No impact to announced IP address space was\nobserved. Zain Bahrain acknowledged the connectivity disruption in a social\nmedia post on March 4, noting (translated) \u201cWe would like to inform you that\nsome customers may encounter difficulties in using some of our services. Our\ntechnical team works to avoid these difficulties as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\n### Multiple networks in Ukraine\n\nOn March 13, an attack targeted a number of Ukrainian telecommunications\nproviders, including AS16066 (Triangulum), AS34359 (Link Telecom Ukraine),\nAS197522 (Kalush Information Network), AS52074 (Mandarun), and AS29013\n(LinkKremen). Triangulum appeared to be the most significantly impacted,\nexperiencing a near complete loss of traffic between March 13 and March 20, as\nseen below. Triangulum posted a notice on its website, noting in part \u201cOn\nMarch 13, 2024, a hacker attack was carried out on a number of Ukrainian\nproviders. At 10:28 a.m. on March 13, 2024, a large-scale technical failure\noccurred on our Company's network, as a result of which it became impossible\nto provide electronic communication services. The Company's employees,\ntogether with employees of the Cyber Police and the National Cyber Security\nCoordination Center, are taking comprehensive measures around the clock aimed\nat restoring the entire range of services as soon as possible. Services are\nbeing restored gradually. Full recovery may take several days.\u201d\n\nOther affected providers experienced comparatively shorter connectivity\ndisruptions. The near complete outage at Mandarun lasted approximately a day,\nwhile the others saw outages lasting around seven hours, starting around 11:30\nlocal time (09:30 UTC) on March 13, with connectivity returning to typical\nlevels around 08:00 local time (06:00 UTC) on March 14.\n\n## Government directed\n\n### Comoros\n\nFollowing protests against the re-election of President Azali Assoumani,\nauthorities in Comoros reportedly shut down Internet connectivity on January\n17. While some disruption was visible to traffic at a country level between\n12:00 local time on January 17 (09:00 UTC) and 17:30 local time on January 19\n(14:30 UTC), it was significantly more noticeable in the traffic from AS36939\n(Comores Telecom), which saw several periods of near-complete outage across\nthe two-day span. Although Comores Telecom announces a limited amount of IPv4\naddress space, it saw significant volatility on January 17 & 18, dropping to\nzero several times.\n\n### Sudatel Senegal/Expresso Telecom and Tigo/Free (Senegal)\n\nOn February 4, the Minister of Communication, Telecommunications, and Digital\nAffairs in Senegal ordered the suspension of mobile Internet connectivity\nstarting at 22:00 local time (22:00 UTC). The suspension followed protests\nthat erupted in the wake of the postponement of the presidential election.\nTraffic from AS37196 (Sudatel Senegal/Expresso Telecom) fell sharply at the\ntime the suspension went into effect, recovering around 07:30 local time\n(07:30 UTC) on February 7. Traffic from AS37649 (Tigo/Free) fell at around\n09:30 local time (09:30 UTC) on February 5, with the provider notifying\nsubscribers of the suspension via social media. Traffic on Tigo/Free recovered\naround midnight local time (00:00 UTC) on February 7, and the provider again\nused social media to inform subscribers of service availability. No changes\nwere observed to announced IP address space for either provider, indicating\nthat the suspension of mobile Internet connectivity was not done at a routing\nlevel.\n\nA little more than a week later, on February 13, the government in Senegal\nagain ordered the suspension of mobile Internet connectivity in an effort to\nprevent \"the spread of hateful and subversive messages online.\" ahead of a\nmarch planned by activist groups which aimed to express dissent against the\npostponement of the presidential election. The mobile Internet shutdown was\nmost visible on Tigo/Free, which saw a significant disruption between 10:15\nand 19:45 local time (10:15 - 19:45 UTC).\n\n### Pakistan\n\nAccording to a published report, The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority\n(PTA) said that Internet services would remain available as citizens went to\nthe polls on February 8 to elect a new government. However, on that day,\nPakistani authorities cut mobile Internet access across the country as the\nnation\u2019s voters went to cast their ballots, with the authorities attributing\nthe move \"to maintain law and order\" in the wake of the violence that occurred\nthe previous day. The impact of the ordered shutdown was visible across\nmultiple Internet providers in Pakistan, including AS59257 (Zong/CMPak),\nAS24499 (Telenor Pakistan), and AS45669 (Jazz/Mobilink), lasting from 07:00\nuntil 20:00 (02:00 - 15:00 UTC), with traffic returning to expected levels\napproximately nine hours later. A post on the Internet Society\u2019s Pulse blog\nestimated that the shutdown cost Pakistan nearly USD $18.5M in lost Gross\nDomestic Product.\n\n### Chad\n\nSeveral Internet disruptions were observed in Chad between February 28 and\nMarch 7. The first one started at 10:45 local time on February 28 and lasted\nuntil 18:00 local time on March 1 (09:45 on February 28 - 17:00 on March 1).\nShorter disruptions lasting just a few hours each were also observed on March\n3, 4, and 7. The apparent shutdowns came in the wake of political violence in\nthe country. Notable drops in announced IPv4 address space aggregated across\nnetworks in the country were observed coincident with the February 28, March\n3, and March 4 shutdowns, although it isn\u2019t clear why a similar drop did not\noccur on March 7.\n\n## Power outages\n\n### Tajikistan\n\nAccording to a published report, a widespread multi-hour power outage occurred\nin Tajikistan on March 1, possibly related to increased electricity usage by\nelectric heaters as temperatures across the country neared freezing. The\noutage began around 11:00 local time (06:00 UTC), and lasted for approximately\nthree hours. The impact on Internet traffic from the country is visible in the\ngraph below. Although power was restored around 14:00 local time (09:00 UTC),\nInternet traffic did not return to expected levels until around 05:00 local\ntime the next day (midnight UTC on March 2).\n\nAlthough power outages most often have the biggest impact on Internet traffic,\nas computers and home/office routers shut down, this outage also appeared to\nimpact network infrastructure within the country, as the aggregate volume of\nannounced IPv4 address space across the country dipped slightly when the power\nwas out.\n\n### Tanzania\n\nOn March 4, the Tanzania Electricity Corporation (TANESCO) posted a notice on\nsocial media regarding an ongoing power outage. It stated (translated) \u201cThe\nTanzania Electricity Corporation (TANESCO) has notified the public that there\nhas been an error in the National Grid system, resulting in a lack of\nelectricity service in some areas of the country including Zanzibar. Our\nexperts are continuing their efforts to ensure that the electricity service\nreturns to its normal state. The organization apologizes for any inconvenience\ncaused.\u201d The power outage disrupted Internet connectivity in Tanzania, causing\nan observed drop in traffic between 13:30 and 23:00 local time (10:30 - 20:00\nUTC).\n\n## Technical problems\n\n### Orange Espa\u00f1a\n\nNetwork routing is the process of selecting a path across one or more\nnetworks, and on the Internet, routing relies on the Border Gateway Protocol\n(BGP). Historically, the exchange of BGP routing information was based on\ntrust between providers, but over time, security mechanisms such as Resource\nPublic Key Infrastructure (RPKI) have been developed to prevent abuse of the\nsystem by bad actors. RPKI is a cryptographic method of signing records that\nassociate a BGP route announcement with the correct originating AS number. ROA\n(Route Origin Authorization) records provide a means of verifying that an IP\naddress block holder has authorized an AS (Autonomous System) to originate\nroutes to that one or more prefixes within the address block. Cloudflare has\npublished a number of blog posts over the years about the importance of, and\nour support for, RPKI. Properly implemented and configured, RPKI and ROAs help\nsupport routing security, effectively preventing behavior like BGP hijacking.\n\nThe RIPE NCC (\u201cRIPE\u201d) is one of five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) that\nprovides Internet resource allocation and registration, and coordination\nactivities. RIPE\u2019s region covers Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia. On\nJanuary 3, a malicious actor took advantage of lax account security on the\npart of RIPE and AS12479 (Orange Espa\u00f1a) and used credentials found on the\npublic Internet to log into Orange Espa\u00f1a\u2019s RIPE account. Once in control of\nthe account, the attacker published multiple ROAs with \u201cbogus\u201d origins,\nrendering thousands of routes originated by AS12479 \u201cRPKI-invalid\u201d, which\nresulted in carriers that reject RPKI-invalid routes to stop carrying a large\namount of Orange Espa\u00f1a\u2019s IP space.\n\nBecause Cloudflare enforces RPKI validation, we also rejected the RPKI-invalid\nroutes. We would have started trying to reach Orange Espa\u00f1a over our default\nroute toward some of our transit providers, but because they also perform RPKI\nvalidation, traffic would have been dropped within those provider networks as\nwell. Because of this, from Cloudflare\u2019s perspective, this incident caused a\ndrop in traffic from Orange Espa\u00f1a between 16:45 and 19:45 local time (14:45 -\n17:45 UTC) as well as a notable drop in announced IPv4 address space from\nAS12479.\n\nOrange Espa\u00f1a confirmed on social media that its RIPE account had been\nimproperly accessed, and as a result of the incident, RIPE has made two-factor\nauthentication (2FA) mandatory for logins. For additional insights into the\nincident, Doug Madory at Kentik and Ben Cartwright-Cox at bgp.tools have both\npublished detailed analyses and timelines.\n\n### MaxNet (Ukraine)\n\nOn January 11, subscribers of AS34700 (MaxNet) in Ukraine experienced a nine-\nhour Internet outage. Initial traffic loss occurred around 16:00 local time\n(14:00 UTC), and recovered around 01:00 local time on January 12 (23:00 UTC on\nJanuary 11). An initial social media post from the provider explained the\nreason for the outage, noting (translated) \u201cDear subscribers! Due to the\nflooding of one of the hub sites due to a utility malfunction, some areas of\nthe city may be without services, partially or completely. We are doing our\nbest to restore services, but it takes time. Further information regarding the\nopening times will be published as soon as the emergency works have been\ncompleted.\u201d A subsequent post informed subscribers that Internet connectivity\nhad been restored. The flooding apparently impacted core routing\ninfrastructure as well, as the volume of IPv4 address space announced by\nMaxNet also fell to zero between 16:00 and 22:00 local time (14:00 - 20:00\nUTC).\n\n### Plusnet (United Kingdom)\n\nA traffic disruption observed on AS6871 (Plusnet) in the United Kingdom on\nJanuary 15 was initially characterized as a \u201cmass outage\u201d by the provider in\nreplies to customer complaints on social media. However, the underlying cause\nof the disruption turned out to be significantly less sensational \u2013 it was\napparently linked to problems with their DNS servers. Because subscribers were\nunable to successfully resolve hostnames using Plusnet\u2019s default DNS\nresolvers, this ultimately manifested itself as a drop in traffic from the\nnetwork for approximately two hours, between 16:00 and 18:00 local time (and\nUTC). Users that had configured their systems to use a third-party DNS\nresolver, such as Cloudflare\u2019s 1.1.1.1 service, did not experience a service\ndisruption.\n\n### Russia\n\nDNS issues also impacted users in Russia during January, though in a different\nway than Plusnet subscribers in the UK experienced. A reported DNSSEC failure\non January 30 resulted in .ru domains becoming inaccessible for several hours.\n(DNSSEC creates a secure domain name system by adding cryptographic signatures\nto existing DNS records. By checking its associated signature, you can verify\nthat a requested DNS record comes from its authoritative name server and\nwasn\u2019t altered en-route, as opposed to a fake record injected in a man-in-the-\nmiddle attack.)\n\nThe DNSSEC validation failure resulted in SERVFAIL responses to DNS lookups\nagainst Cloudflare\u2019s 1.1.1.1 resolver for hostnames in the .ru country code\ntop level domain (ccTLD). At peak, 68.4% of requests received SERVFAIL\nresponses. The Coordination Center for the .ru ccTLD confirmed that it was\nworking on the \u201ctechnical problem affecting the .ru zone associated with the\nglobal DNSSEC infrastructure\u201d but didn\u2019t provide any additional details around\nthe root cause of the problem, such as a potential issue with a DNSSEC key\nrollover. The .ru ccTLD experienced a similar DNSSEC-related outage for\nseveral hours on August 16, 2019, as well.\n\n### AT&T (United States)\n\nStarting just before 04:00 Eastern / 03:00 Central (09:00 UTC) on February 22,\nAT&T subscribers in several cities across the United States experienced mobile\nservice interruptions. Impacted cities included Atlanta, Houston, and Chicago,\nwith connectivity disrupted for approximately eight hours. Cloudflare data\nshowed that as the problem began, AT&T (AS7018) traffic dropped as much as 45%\nin Chicago and 18% in Dallas, as compared with the previous week.\n\nAccording to a \u201cnetwork update\u201d published by AT&T, \u201cBased on our initial\nreview, we believe that today\u2019s outage was caused by the application and\nexecution of an incorrect process used as we were expanding our network, not a\ncyber attack.\u201d\n\n## Maintenance\n\n### Vodafone Egypt\n\nBetween 05:15 and 11:30 local time (03:15 - 09:30 UTC) on March 5, customers\nof AS36935 (Vodafone Egypt) experienced disruptions to their mobile Internet\nconnectivity, with observed traffic from the network dropping as much as 70%\nbelow expected levels. A (translated) social media post from the provider\nnoted in part \u201cWe apologize that some areas are currently affected by\ndifficulties in operating the 4G service due to updates that took place this\nmorning.\u201d As a result of the 4G network outage, Vodafone was required to\ncompensate affected customers, and was also fined by Egypt's National\nTelecommunications Regulatory Authority (NTRA).\n\n### Ocean Wave Communication (Myanmar)\n\nJust before noon local time (05:15 UTC) on March 12, a significant drop in\ntraffic was observed on AS136442 (Ocean Wave), a consumer fiber and business\nInternet service provider in Myanmar. A (translated) social media post from\nthe provider noted \u201cOcean Wave customers, please be informed that there will\nbe no internet/ slow connection due to network maintenance.\u201d The connectivity\ndisruption lasted approximately seven hours, with traffic returning to typical\nlevels just before 19:00 local time (12:15 UTC).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTwo notable submarine cable damage events during the first quarter again\nhighlighted the importance of protecting submarine cables, and the risks\nassociated with them passing through/near geopolitically sensitive areas.\nGiven the reliance on submarine cables for carrying Internet traffic, this\nwill continue to be an issue for many years to come.\n\nThe Orange Espa\u00f1a incident also shed light on the importance of securing\noperationally important resources with multi-factor authentication, a topic\nthat Cloudflare has written about in the past. Organizations like RIPE play a\ncritically important behind-the-scenes role in functioning of the Internet,\narguably obligating them to take all practical precautions when it comes to\nsecuring their systems in order to prevent malicious actors from taking\nactions that could broadly disrupt Internet connectivity.\n\nThe Cloudflare Radar team is constantly monitoring for Internet disruptions,\nsharing our observations on the Cloudflare Radar Outage Center, via social\nmedia, and in posts on blog.cloudflare.com.
