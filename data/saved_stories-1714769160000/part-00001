I'm glad you're here.\n\nFor the majority of consumers, our household gadgets and appliances often\nremain unchanged for years before we consider replacing them. No one expects\nyou to replace your washing machine or television annually, not even the\nmanufacturers. In fact, durability is often a selling point, with\nmanufacturers striving to differentiate themselves by producing durable, long-\nlasting products that align with consumer expectations.\n\nHowever, the situation takes a different turn with smartphones, computers, and\nother smart devices. These devices seem to carry an expectation of frequent\nupgrades, with consumers subtly (and sometimes not so subtly) encouraged to\nupgrade frequently. While it would be absurd for a washing machine\nmanufacturer to anticipate yearly replacements, the same cannot be said for\nsmartphones. In reality, the average consumer retains their washing machine\nfor a decade, and TVs last an average of seven to ten years before being\nreplaced.\n\nThis pattern isn't exclusive to consumer tech products like smartphones and\nlaptops. The software industry, largely adopted the \"subscription as a\nservice\" model as a defense to address consumer reluctance to upgrade some of\ntheir applications such as Office and Photoshop with new editions.\n\n###\n\nSo, why the disconnect?\n\n\"To understand why, let's explore the Innovation Lifecycle. The innovation\nlifecycle begins with an inventor or a company making a groundbreaking\ndiscovery or invention brimming with potential to transform our lives. And\nover subsequent years and generations of refinements and advancements, the\nfull potential of this invention becomes unlocked, with new features and\ncapabilities constantly added.\n\nThe main reason for different expectations lies in the word \"refinements.\"\nWhile technological advancements have leaped forward in recent decades, it's\ncrucial to recognize that the software and computing industries are still\nrelatively young. It took a long time and several generations of improvements\nfor big inventions like the cinematography, washing machines, and TVs to\nbecome common, even though the basic technology was there. Comparatively, the\niPhone, which came out in 2007\u2014less than 20 years ago\u2014is still relatively\nyoung compared with these historical examples. And for a while, various\nsectors of the computing and software industries remained in the early phase\nof the 'refinement' stage.\n\nNo one knows how long a product can remain in the refinement stage of the\ninnovation lifecycle. But as long as a product remained in the stage, there\nare significant returns on innovation investment and companies can innovate at\nthe speed of light. Successive generations of products are released with\nsubstantial improvements. And with each iteration, customers are happy to fork\nmoney, because they can feel and notice the impact of the changes.\n\nProducts like the washing machine have largely reached the end of the\ninnovation cycle, with diminishing returns on further improvements. This\ndoesn't mean innovation has stopped altogether in the washing machine\nindustry. Rather, the level of innovation isn't substantial enough to warrant\nyearly replacements with consumers realizing the current products as \"good\nenough,\".\n\nThis explains why some products, such as washing machines, are rarely replaced\nfor a decade, while others, like smartphones, are replaced more frequently. It\nall depends on the stage of the product in the innovation lifecycle. If a\nchange is noticeable and the impact of improvements can be felt, customers are\nlikely to upgrade and if the changes are minimal, customers are likely to\nconsider their current product as \"good enough\".\n\n###\n\nEntering an Era of Diminishing Returns\n\nThe issue of diminishing returns is a widespread concern in various\nindustries. But for the computing and software industry, my hypothesis is\nthat, for the first time, the industry has entered an era of generally\ndiminishing returns. Now, many companies will face challenges in navigating\nthis new landscape as their products mature and significant advancements\nbecome less frequent.\n\n###\n\nThe golden age of upgrades\n\nLet's take smartphones as an example. Following the release of the first\niPhone and Android devices, each passing year brought remarkable advancements,\ngiving consumers strong incentives to upgrade.\n\nInitially, phones had limited memory, often less than 512MB, which required\nusers to close apps to multitask effectively. However, today, it's common to\nfind smartphones equipped with 6GB or even 8GB of RAM. Furthermore, screens\nhave significantly increased in size, boasting higher refresh rates and\nresolutions.\n\nWe've witnessed the rise of fingerprint sensors and optical scanners, as well\nas cameras with razor-sharp clarity that rival professional-grade technology.\nAdditionally, other notable enhancements include faster CPUs, AMOLED screens,\nwireless and fast charging capabilities, sleeker and thinner designs, and\nwaterproof models.\n\n###\n\nInnovation in Decline?\n\nHowever, a closer look reveals that most of these innovations occurred before\nthe 2020s. Recent releases often focus on incremental improvements in speed\nand camera technology. Even the aesthetic design of smartphones has remained\nlargely unchanged, with manufacturers like Samsung maintaining the same look\nfor years, signaling a slowdown in innovation.\n\nThis isn't because companies have lost interest in innovation. Rather, it's\nbecause consumers view current offerings as \"good enough,\" reducing the\nincentive for significant investments in research and development.\n\nSmartphones have reached a level of performance where additional improvements\nare often imperceptible to users. For instance, the distinction between\nwatching a full HD movie and a 4K movie on a 6.6-inch screen is barely\ndiscernible. This trend extends to other areas such as cameras and RAM, where\ndifferences are becoming increasingly negligible.\n\nAnd as diminishing returns creeps in into the smartphone industry, consumers\nwill increasingly expect longevity from their devices, much like their\nexpectations for washing machines and TVs. As evidence of this shift, many\nsmartphone companies are now providing seven years of security updates, a\ndeparture from previous practices.\n\n###\n\nBeyond Smartphones: A Broader Trend\n\nThe phenomenon of diminishing returns isn't limited to just smartphones.\nApple's M1 chip, released three years ago, represented a significant\nadvancement that fueled consumer demand. However, the improvements in the\nupcoming M3 chip aren't substantial enough to persuade most users that their\nM1 chip is outdated. Consumers from other brands are also using their laptops\nand desktops longer and longer with each purchase.\n\nSimilarly, the software industry has also reached a stage of diminishing\nreturns. Companies have had to resort to strategies like Software as a Service\n(SaaS) early on to justify products with minimal innovation, there are others\nimportant reasons for software companies for adopting the SaaS model, but a\nprimary driver was for preventing customers not willing to pay for software\nupgrades.\n\nThe software industry has also reached a point of diminishing returns. To keep\nselling products with little innovation and maintain their stock prices,\ncompanies turned to strategies like Software as a Service (SaaS) or launching\nnew product line. While there are other reasons for software companies to\nadopt the SaaS model, a key reason was to stop customers from refusing to pay\nfor software upgrades.\n\nLikewise, the game console industry will eventually encounter diminishing\nreturns, albeit over a longer period of time. As consoles achieve peak\nperformance and enhanced graphics, there will come a time when the differences\nbetween generations are less noticeable, and the current consoles will feel\ngood enough.\n\n###\n\nThe Challenge of Innovation When Products Mature\n\nOnce a product becomes \"good enough\" and reaches maturity, it becomes\nchallenging to justify further investment in research and development (R&D),\nespecially once the initial easy improvements have been made. Companies\nstruggle to identify new enhancements and mostly turns to explore alternative\nrevenue streams. This is why tech giants like Apple and Google heavily invest\nin so-called moonshot projects, diversifying from their core offerings.\n\nInnovation is typically more straightforward in the early stages of a\nproduct's life cycle. Take the cinematograph, for example. Initially, the path\nforward was clear: improving sound, colour, graphics, and resolution. However,\nas progress continues, identifying the next level of improvement becomes less\nclear-cut.\n\nEven when products mature and innovation appears to stall, breakthroughs like\nthe transition from incandescent to LED bulbs are still possible, albeit\nwithout guarantees. Nonetheless, these breakthroughs often come from new and\nunexpected players, causing major disruption that established companies could\nnot have anticipated or supported. A quick look of disruptive inventions\nreveals that they are primarily driven by newcomers to the area.\n\n###\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nSimilar to your washing machine, it's time for the consumer tech industry to\nacknowledge that consumers now expect their products to last longer\u2014an\nexpectation that has always been present. While this may surprise companies\nwhose founders grew up in an era of frequent technological turnover, it's\ncrucial to understand that such quick upgrade cycles were never meant to be\npermanent; they were simply a consequence of the industry's youth. Other\nmature industries have already embraced this reality.\n\nThe recent push for \"smart\" features in everything from TVs and refrigerators\nto even basic kitchen appliance can also be seen as an attempt of traditional\nmanufacturers to maintain a faster upgrade cycle, mimicking the tactics of the\nyoung tech companies.\n\nThat is it for this week, in a future issue, we'll explore how companies are\nnavigating this shift in consumer demand for long-lasting products. We'll\nexamine both positive and negative responses to this trend, scrutinizing how\nsome companies are innovating while others struggle to adapt or actively\nresist change.\n\nThanks for reading QED!
