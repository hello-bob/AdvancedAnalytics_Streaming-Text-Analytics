Mirador/Sipa USA (AP)\n\nWould you let Elon Musk tinker with your brain? That\u2019s a question we all might\nbe facing in the future if his brain-computer interface company Neuralink\nsucceeds. But anyone who\u2019s ready to raise their hands for brain surgery might\nwant to hear what one of the Neuralink co-founders recently said during an\ninterview with the Wall Street Journal.\n\n#### Related Content\n\nElon Musk Says Neuralink's First Patient Can Move a Computer Mouse With Their\nThoughts\n\nElon Musk Says Neuralink Has Implanted Its Chip in a Human for the First Time\n\nDid Elon Musk Regret Buying Twitter? | Walter Isaacson Interview\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nview video\n\nDid Elon Musk Regret Buying Twitter? | Walter Isaacson Interview\n\nThe Wall Street Journal podcast The Future of Everything recently sat down\nwith Dr. Benjamin Rapoport, a neurosurgeon who co-founded Neuralink with Musk\nand a team of scientists back in 2016. Rapoport left Neuralink to start his\nown company called Precision Neuroscience and one specific part of the\ninterview really stood out to us. Specifically, the part where Rapoport seemed\nto suggest he left over safety concerns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nElon Musk Says Neuralink's First Patient Can Move a Computer Mouse With Their\nThoughts\n\nElon Musk Says Neuralink Has Implanted Its Chip in a Human for the First Time\n\nDid Elon Musk Regret Buying Twitter? | Walter Isaacson Interview\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nDid Elon Musk Regret Buying Twitter? | Walter Isaacson Interview\n\n\u201cYou co-founded Neuralink alongside Elon Musk, and you ended up leaving to\nstart Precision. Why did you decide to leave and start a new company?\u201d the\nWall Street Journal\u2019s Danny Lewis asked in the May 3 episode.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve pretty much devoted my entire professional life to bringing neural\ninterfaces from the world of science to the world of medicine. But I felt that\nin order to move to the world of medicine and technology, safety is\nparamount,\u201d Dr. Rapaport said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor a medical device, safety often implies minimal invasiveness,\u201d Rapaport\ncontinued. \u201cAnd in the early days of brain-computer interfaces, there was this\nnotion that in order to extract information-rich data from the brain, one\nneeded to penetrate the brain with tiny little needle-like electrodes\u201d\n\nDr. Rapaport continued to explain on the podcast that this method has one big\ndrawback. It causes \u201csome amount of brain damage when they\u2019re inserted to the\nbrain.\u201d That, of course, is less than ideal. And Rapaport says he believed it\nwas possible, \u201cto extract information-rich data from the brain without\ndamaging the brain.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr. Rapaport goes on to say he formed Precision Neuroscience with that\nphilosophy in mind. It was crucial to focus on \u201cminimal invasiveness,\nscalability, and safety\u201d when producing neural interfaces. And he believes\nthat\u2019s what sets his company apart from Neuralink.\n\n\u201cThe Neuralink system is based on penetrating microelectrodes. The Precision\nsystem is based on surface microelectrodes, which are tiny little electrodes\nthat coat the surface of the brain without penetrating it,\u201d Rapaport\nexplained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrain-computer interfaces have made tremendous strides in the past decade,\nallowing people to literally control machines with their thoughts. Companies\nlike Musk\u2019s Neuralink tend to get all the headlines, but there are a number of\nfirms, including Synchron, Paradromics, and Precision Neuroscience. And they\nall have their own philosophies on what level of invasiveness is permissible.\n\nNeuralink has received plenty of criticism over the years, with MIT Technology\nReview calling it \u201cneuroscience theater\u201d back in 2020, and horrifying\nallegations of monkey torture were revealed in 2022. Fifteen monkeys were\nreported to have died at a Neuralink facility between 2017 and 2020, according\nto a complaint filed with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. But Musk\nrejected the idea that monkeys in Neuralink labs died gruesome deaths,\nclaiming instead that they lived in \u201cmonkey paradise.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of that criticism has stopped people from getting excited about the\npossibilities in brain-computer interfaces, even if it\u2019s work tied to\nNeuralink. The company recently released a video of a Neuralink patient\nplaying video games with his mind. And there are more than a few people on\nsocial media who are ready to have Musk outfit them with experimental brain-\ncomputer interface tech.\n\nGizmodo tried to reach Dr. Rapoport through Precision Neuroscience\u2019s website\non Sunday but did not hear back. We\u2019ll update this post if we receive a reply.\nNeuralink also didn\u2019t respond to an email on Monday.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
