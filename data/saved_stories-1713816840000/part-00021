A second phase of the ban,\nexpected next year, will ban all single-use plastics including containers for\nboth dine-in and takeaway.\n\nA pedestrian carries takeaway food plastic bags in Hong Kong, Wednesday, March\n13, 2024. (AP Photo/Louise Delmotte)\n\nMany restaurants have already begun implementing the new measure.\n\nKuen Fat Kitchen is a typical lunch stop for many people in Hong Kong. Even\nbefore the new law was introduced, it had already started to reduce the use of\nStyrofoam boxes.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nHong Kong denies entry to Reporters Without Borders staffer in latest blow to\nmedia freedoms\n\nA fire in a 16-story Hong Kong residential building kills at least 5 people\nand injures dozens\n\nUS treads carefully in responding to Hong Kong\u2019s new national security law\n\nOwner Kitty Chan said the changes will mean higher costs.\n\n\u201cFor a single-use cutlery set, you might think it\u2019s just a small change, but\nswitching the plastic spoon to a paper spoon doubles the cost for us. So, it\u2019s\nnot so friendly to the business of the food and beverage industry,\u201d Chan\nadded.\n\nCustomers at Kuen Fat Kitchen have mixed feelings. Some don\u2019t want to face\nextra hassle when going out to eat if they are asked to bring their own\ncontainers and utensils.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m at work, I only have an hour for lunch, and I need to eat\nefficiently. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s convenient for me to bring my own cutlery and\ndo the washing up afterwards. It\u2019s not convenient and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a\ngood idea,\u201d said customer Darren Seng.\n\nLeftover food in a plastic lunch box lies on the table of Kuen Fat Kitchen in\nHong Kong, Wednesday, April 10, 2024.

Many businesses\nare changing to alternative plastics made of natural resources to comply with\nnew rules, instead of improving their packaging, the organization added.\n\nGreenpeace campaigner Leanne Tam hopes that the new law will discourage the\nthrowaway culture and promote reusables, instead of \u201cgreener\u201d disposables.\n\nCustomers eat food in disposable boxes at Kuen Fat Kitchen, a typical lunch\nstop, in Hong Kong, Wednesday, April 10, 2024.

(AP Photo/Louise\nDelmotte)\n\n\u201cAny kind of plastic ban policy should aim to influence the public to stay\naway from plastic. We should move on, and have a new approach,\u201d said Tam. \u201cBut\nwe would like to remind the government that it should devote more resources to\npromote reusable instead of disposable. This is the way to solve the root of\nthe problem.\u201d\n\nAccording to the latest figures by Hong Kong\u2019s government in 2022, the city\ndisposed 11,128 tons of solid waste per day, among which plastics contributed\n2,369 tons.\n\nHong Kong is reliant on the city\u2019s three landfills to handle its waste, but\nthey are expected to be filled up by around 2026, according to the government.\n\nThe city plans to implement municipal solid waste charging from Aug. 1, but\nthe logistics have yet to be worked out. It would compel individual homes,\nrestaurants, and all businesses to pay for trash they throw away.\n\nA pedestrian carries takeaway food plastic bag in Hong Kong, Wednesday, March\n13, 2024.
