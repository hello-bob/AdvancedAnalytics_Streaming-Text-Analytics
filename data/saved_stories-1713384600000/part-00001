Don't take my word for\nit: I'm in the canon:\n\nhttps://tachyonpublications.com/product/rewired-the-post-cyberpunk-\nanthology-2/\n\nOne of the editors of that \"post-cyberpunk\" anthology was John Kessel, who is,\nnot coincidentally, the first writer to expose me to the power of literary\ncriticism to change the way I felt about a novel, both as a writer and a\nreader:\n\nhttps://locusmag.com/2012/05/cory-doctorow-a-prose-by-any-other-name/\n\nIt was Kessel's 2004 Foundation essay, \"Creating the Innocent Killer: Ender's\nGame, Intention, and Morality,\" that helped me understand litcrit. Kessel\nexpertly surfaces the subtext of Card's Ender's Game and connects it to Card's\npolitics. In so doing, he completely reframed how I felt about a book I'd read\nseveral times and had considered a favorite:\n\nhttps://johnjosephkessel.wixsite.com/kessel-website/creating-the-innocent-\nkiller\n\nThis is a head-spinning experience for a reader, but it's even wilder to\nexperience it as a writer. Thankfully, the majority of literary criticism\nabout my work has been positive, but even then, discovering something that's\nclearly present in one of my novels, but which I didn't consciously include,\nis a (very pleasant!) mind-fuck.\n\nA recent example: Blair Fix's review of my 2023 novel Red Team Blues which he\ncalls \"an anti-finance finance thriller\":\n\nhttps://economicsfromthetopdown.com/2023/05/13/red-team-blues-cory-doctorows-\nanti-finance-thriller/\n\nFix \u2013 a radical economist \u2013 perfectly captures the correspondence between my\nhero, the forensic accountant Martin Hench, and the heroes of noir detective\nnovels. Namely, that a noir detective is a kind of unlicensed policeman, going\nto the places the cops can't go, asking the questions the cops can't ask, and\nthus solving the crimes the cops can't solve. What makes this noir is what\nhappens next: the private dick realizes that these were places the cops didn't\nwant to go, questions the cops didn't want to ask and crimes the cops didn't\nwant to solve (\"It's Chinatown, Jake\").\n\nMarty Hench \u2013 a forensic accountant who finds the money that has been\ndisappeared through the cells in cleverly constructed spreadsheets \u2013 is an\nunlicensed tax inspector. He's finding the money the IRS can't find \u2013 only to\nbe reminded, time and again, that this is money the IRS chooses not to find.\n\nThis is how the tax authorities work, after all. Anyone who followed the\ncoverage of the big finance leaks knows that the most shocking revelation they\ncontain is how stupid the ruses of the ultra-wealthy are. The IRS could\nprevent that tax-fraud, they just choose not to. Not for nothing, I call the\nMartin Hench books \"Panama Papers fanfic.\"\n\nI've read plenty of noir fiction and I'm a long-term finance-leaks obsessive,\nbut until I read Fix's article, it never occurred to me that a forensic\naccountant was actually squarely within the noir tradition. Hench's perfect\nnoir fit is either a happy accident or the result of a subconscious intuition\nthat I didn't know I had until Fix put his finger on it.\n\nThe second Hench novel is The Bezzle. It's been out since February, and I'm\nstill touring with it (Chicago tonight! Then Turin, Marin County, Winnipeg,\nCalgary, Vancouver, etc). It's paying off \u2013 the book's a national bestseller.\n\nWriting in his newsletter, Henry Farrell connects Fix's observation to one of\nhis own, about the nature of \"hackers\" and their role in cyberpunk (and post-\ncyberpunk) fiction:\n\nhttps://www.programmablemutter.com/p/the-accountant-as-cyberpunk-hero\n\nFarrell cites Bruce Schneier's 2023 book, A Hacker\u2019s Mind: How the Powerful\nBend Society\u2019s Rules and How to Bend Them Back:\n\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2023/02/06/trickster-makes-the-world/\n\nSchneier, a security expert, broadens the category of \"hacker\" to include\nanyone who studies systems with an eye to finding and exploiting their\ndefects. Under this definition, the more fearsome hackers are \"working for a\nhedge fund, finding a loophole in financial regulations that lets her siphon\nextra profits out of the system.\" Hackers work in corporate offices, or as\ngovernment lobbyists.\n\nAs Henry says, hacking isn't intrinsically countercultural (\"Most of the\nhacking you might care about is done by boring seeming people in boring\nseeming clothes\"). Hacking reinforces \u2013 rather than undermining power\nasymmetries (\"The rich have far more resources to figure out how to gimmick\nthe rules\"). We are mostly not the hackers \u2013 we are the hacked.\n\nFor Henry, Marty Hench is a hacker (the rare hacker that works for the good\nguys), even though \"he doesn\u2019t wear mirrorshades or get wasted chatting to\nbartenders with Soviet military-surplus mechanical arms.\" He's a gun for hire,\nthat most traditional of cyberpunk heroes, and while he doesn't stand against\nthe system, he's not for it, either.\n\nHenry's pinning down something I've been circling around for nearly 30 years:\nthe idea that though \"the street finds its own use for things,\" Wall Street\nand Madison Avenue are among the streets that might find those uses:\n\nhttps://craphound.com/nonfic/street.html\n\nHenry also connects Martin Hench to Marcus Yallow, the hero of my YA Little\nBrother series. I have tried to make this connection myself, opining that\nwhile Marcus is a character who is fighting to save an internet that he loves,\nMarty is living in the ashes of the internet he lost:\n\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2023/05/07/dont-curb-your-enthusiasm/\n\nBut Henry's Marty-as-hacker notion surfaces a far more interesting connection\nbetween the two characters. Marcus is a vehicle for conveying the excitement\nand power of hacking to young readers, while Marty is a vessel for older\nreaders who know the stark terror of being hacked, by the sadistic wolves\nwho're coming for all of us:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I44L1pzi4gk\n\nBoth Marcus and Marty are explainers, as am I. Some people say that exposition\nmakes for bad narrative. Those people are wrong:\n\nhttps://maryrobinettekowal.com/journal/my-favorite-bit/my-favorite-bit-cory-\ndoctorow-talks-about-the-bezzle/\n\n\"Explaining\" makes for great fiction. As Maria Farrell writes in her Crooked\nTimber review of The Bezzle, the secret sauce of some of the best novels is\n\"information about how things work. Things like locks, rifles, security\nsystems\":\n\nhttps://crookedtimber.org/2024/03/06/the-bezzle/\n\nWhere these things are integrated into the story's \"reason and urgency,\" they\nbecome \"specialist knowledge [that] cuts new paths to move through the world.\"\nHacking, in other words.\n\nThis is a theme Paul Di Filippo picked up on in his review of The Bezzle for\nLocus:\n\nhttps://locusmag.com/2024/04/paul-di-filippo-reviews-the-bezzle-by-cory-\ndoctorow/\n\n> Heinlein was always known\u2014and always came across in his writings\u2014as The Man\n> Who Knew How the World Worked. Doctorow delivers the same sense of putting\n> yourself in the hands of a fellow who has peered behind Oz\u2019s curtain. When\n> he fills you in lucidly about some arcane bit of economics or computer tech\n> or social media scam, you feel, first, that you understand it completely\n> and, second, that you can trust Doctorow\u2019s analysis and insights.\n\nKnowledge is power, and so expository fiction that delivers news you can use\nis novel that makes you more powerful \u2013 powerful enough to resist the hackers\nwho want to hack you.\n\nHenry and I were both friends of Aaron Swartz, and the Little Brother books\nare closely connected to Aaron, who helped me with Homeland, the second\nvolume, and wrote a great afterword for it (Schneier wrote an afterword for\nthe first book). That book \u2013 and Aaron's afterword \u2013 has radicalized a\ngratifying number of principled technologists. I know, because I meet them\nwhen I tour, and because they send me emails. I like to think that these\nhackers are part of Aaron's legacy.\n\nHenry argues that the Hench books are \"purpose-designed to inspire a thousand\nMax Schrems \u2013 people who are probably past their teenage years, have some\ngrounding in the relevant professions, and really want to see things change.\"\n\n(Schrems is the Austrian privacy activist who, as a law student, set in motion\nthe events that led to the passage of the EU's General Data Privacy\nRegulation:)\n\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2020/05/15/out-here-everything-hurts/#noyb\n\nHenry points out that William Gibson's Neuromancer doesn't mention the word\n\"internet\" \u2013 rather, Gibson coined the term cyberspace, which, as Henry says,\nis \"more \u2018capitalism\u2019 than \u2018computerized information'... If you really want to\npenetrate the system, you need to really grasp what money is and what it\ndoes.\"\n\nMaria also wrote one of my all-time favorite reviews of Red Team Blues, also\nfor Crooked Timber:\n\nhttps://crookedtimber.org/2023/05/11/when-crypto-meant-cryptography/\n\nIn it, she compares Hench to Dickens' Bleak House, but for the modern tech\nworld:\n\n> You put the book down feeling it\u2019s not just a fascinating, enjoyable novel,\n> but a document of how Silicon Valley\u2019s very own 1% live and a teeming,\n> energy-emitting snapshot of a critical moment on Earth.\n\nAll my life, I've written to find out what's going on in my own head. It's a\nremarkably effective technique. But it's only recently that I've come to\nappreciate that reading what other people write about my writing can reveal\nthings that I can't see.\n\n(Image: Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Poirot, CC BY-SA 2.0, modified)\n\n# Hey look at this (permalink)\n\n  * Stanford Law-4051/Comm-363 Governance of the Internet https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yBvPMk0gXNLZWkMXnZnJb7oD3AO3DwxdAHghqifihec/edit#heading=h.lv9s24vvf46k\n\n  * Trampoline Unionism https://www.hamiltonnolan.com/p/trampoline-unionism\n\n  * Civil rights groups decry effort to punish US federal inmates for social media use https://www.reuters.com/world/us/civil-rights-groups-decry-effort-punish-us-federal-inmates-social-media-use-2024-04-01/ (h/t Gregory Charlin)\n\n# This day in history (permalink)\n\n#20yrsago The RIAA's Clean Slate \u201camnesty\u201d euthanized\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20040517135600/https://blogs.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/001435.php\n\n#20yrsago 1995 web-hosting rates\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20040421110701/http://1c4.net/\n\n#15yrsago UK wine-sellers declare that wine has horoscopes, advise wine-\ndrinkers to avoid certain moon-days\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/apr/18/wine-lunar-calendar-tesco-\nsupermarkets\n\n#10yrsago Army comes clean about its recruitment AI, accidentally discloses\ninfo about pedophile- and terrorist-catching chatbots that roam the net\nhttps://spacenews.com/pepsi-drops-plans-to-use-orbital-billboard/\n\n#5yrsago The Antitrust Case Against Facebook: a turning point in the debate\nover Big Tech and monopoly https://memex.craphound.com/2019/04/18/the-\nantitrust-case-against-facebook-a-turning-point-in-the-debate-over-big-tech-\nand-monopoly/\n\n#5yrsago The sovereign nation of Iceland has finally invalidated the European\ntrademark on \u201cIceland,\u201d formerly held by a British discount grocery chain\nhttps://www.techdirt.com/2019/04/17/end-absurdity-iceland-country-\nsuccessfully-invalidates-trademark-iceland-foods-grocer/\n\n#5yrsago Dentistry\u2019s evidentiary vacuum allows profiteering butchers to raid\nour mouths for millions https://memex.craphound.com/2019/04/18/dentistrys-\nevidentiary-vacuum-allows-profiteering-butchers-to-raid-our-mouths-for-\nmillions/\n\n#5yrsago 1% of England owns half of England https://whoownsengland.org\n\n#5yrsago Effective July 15, British porn consumers will be required entrust\ntheir sexual tastes to private companies\u2019 badly secured databases\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/porn-block-uk-wired-explains/\n\n#5yrsago We lost the fight for balance in the EU\u2019s Copyright Directive, but\nhere\u2019s what we won https://felixreda.eu/2019/04/not-in-vain/\n\n#5yrsago John Oliver tackles the Sacklers: the litigious, secretive\nbillionaires whose family business engineered the opioid crisis\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qCKR6wy94U\n\n#1yrago How tech does regulatory capture\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2023/04/18/cursed-are-the-sausagemakers/#how-the-\nparties-get-to-yes\n\n# Upcoming appearances (permalink)\n\n  * The Bezzle at Anderson's Books (Chicago), Apr 17 https://www.andersonsbookshop.com/event/cory-doctorow-1\n\n  * Torino Biennale Tecnologia, Apr 21 https://www.turismotorino.org/en/experiences/events/biennale-tecnologia\n\n  * The Bezzle at Book Passage Corte Madera (Marin County), April 27 https://www.bookpassage.com/event/cory-doctorow-bezzle-martin-hench-novel-corte-madera-store\n\n  * Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (Winnipeg), May 2 https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/cory-doctorow-tickets-798820071337\n\n  * Wordfest (Calgary), May 3 https://wordfest.com/2024/event/wordfest-presents-cory-doctorow-2/\n\n  * Massy Arts (Vancouver), May 4 https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/solo-reading-cory-doctorow-the-bezzle-tickets-876989167207\n\n  * Tartu Prima Vista Literary Festival, May 5-11 https://tartu2024.ee/en/kirjandusfestival/\n\n  * Tim O\u2019Reilly and Cory Doctorow on \u201cEnshittification\u201d and the Future of AI, May 14 https://www.oreilly.com/live-events/tim-oreilly-and-cory-doctorow-on-enshittification-and-the-future-of-ai/0642572001651/\n\n  * \"Finding the Money\" screening (LA), May 15 https://www.laemmle.com/film/finding-money?date=2024-05-15\n\n  * Media Ecology Association keynote (Amherst, NY), Jun 6-9 https://media-ecology.org/convention\n\n  * American Association of Law Libraries keynote (Chicago), Jul 21 https://www.aallnet.org/conference/agenda/keynote-speaker/\n\n# Recent appearances (permalink)\n\n  * Deep Dive podcast https://open.spotify.com/episode/0bS0DS1H7ghHkiyx4KzXBV?si=fe7242019e734d61\n\n  * Digital capitalism course: What is digital capitalism?
