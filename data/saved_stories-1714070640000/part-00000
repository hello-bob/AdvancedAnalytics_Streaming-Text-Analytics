Computers and the internet, the most important technologies of\nrecent decades, are the latest step in this long, long process.\n\nHow important are these technologies? How much have they changed society?\nCompared to other events in living memory, they have been revolutionary. The\nworld\u2019s most valuable corporations are now mostly internet software companies.\nThe internet has been responsible for the rise and fall of heads of\ngovernment, and sometimes of entire governments. Computers and the internet\nplay a large role in the daily life and experience of billions of people. I am\nwriting this on a computer right now to share it over the internet.\n\nCommentators have therefore described computers and their effects as among the\ngreatest transformations to ever strike human society, or occasionally even\nthe single most important transition in the history of the species. We see\nthis in the use of terms like \u201cInformation Age\u201d or \u201cDigital Revolution\u201d.\nAccording to Wikipedia\u2019s article on the Information Age, \u201cDuring rare times in\nhuman history, there have been periods of innovation that have transformed\nhuman life. The Neolithic Age, the Scientific Age and the Industrial Age all,\nultimately, induced discontinuous and irreversible changes in the economic,\nsocial and cultural elements of the daily life of most people. Traditionally,\nthese epochs have taken place over hundreds, or in the case of the Neolithic\nRevolution, thousands of years, whereas the Information Age swept to all parts\nof the globe in just a few years.\u201d Or in the \u201cFourth Industrial Revolution\u201d\nframework popularized by the World Economic Forum, human history has seen four\ndistinct industrial revolutions, and fully half of them are the result of\ncomputer technology.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, however, the social changes caused by computers\ndo not live up to these claims. There are many earlier technologies that have\nalso transformed the structure of society and the landscape of power:\nbronzeworking, electricity, antibiotics, the horse collar, the radio,\ngunpowder, the railroad, the atom bomb, contraception, the printing press...\nany student of history could keep the list going. To put computers into\nhistorical perspective, we cannot look only at the effects of computers. We\nalso need to compare these effects to those of other major technologies.\n\nThere is no definitive comparison, but one rough categorization scheme is\nbelow:\n\n  1. Utterly transformative. The difference between societies with and without this technology was on par with the difference between societies of different hominid species. Examples: Agriculture, writing, fire.\n\n  2. Civilization-scale. This technology was sufficient to force a complete reorganization of one of a civilization\u2019s most basic functions, such as economic production or political legitimacy. Examples: Centralized irrigation, printing press, steam engine.\n\n  3. Transformative. While this did not force a major reorganization of how the civilization\u2019s core institutions related to each other, the individual institutions in the relevant fields were forced to reorganize themselves to adapt to the new technology, or else were supplanted by those that did. Examples: Railroads, automobiles, broadcast radio, muskets.\n\n  4. Decisive. While the civilization\u2019s core institutions could adopt the new technology without major reorganization, details of the technology\u2019s powers and limits were a major factor in the specific balance of power between institutions and a source of local advantage. Many particular institutions rose and fell as a result of the new technology\u2014companies went bankrupt, militaries lost wars, governments lost elections. Examples: Artillery, airplanes, television.\n\nA comparison like this cannot be perfectly objective. You might argue over\nexactly where to place different technologies. Perhaps the railroads should be\nat level 4 rather than level 3, depending on how much of a role you assign\nthem in the development of megacorporations (or \u201ctrusts\u201d, as they were called\nat the time). Or you might use a different ranking system that emphasizes\nsomething else, e.g. whether a technology changes the total number of people a\nsociety can support, or how much of an average person\u2019s time is spent\ninteracting with the technology\u2014this scale focuses on how much a technology\naffects the structure of society only because that\u2019s the question we\u2019re asking\nright now.\n\nStill, we can get a very rough ranking of how different technologies stack up\nagainst each other. It is safe to say that writing transformed society more\nthan the telegraph, or that the printing press transformed society more than\nthe airplane, or the steam engine transformed society more than artillery.\nDifferent rankings will disagree on edge cases, but big differences should be\nconsistent. Keeping in mind that this process is inherently very fuzzy, let\u2019s\nrun with this scale for now.\n\nWhere do computers and the internet fall on this scale?\n\nThese technologies have allowed many individual institutions to dominate the\ncompetitive landscape. In business there are companies like Microsoft, Google,\nand many more. In politics there are the campaigns of candidates like Barack\nObama or Donald Trump. Advertising and political education which had\npreviously been done via other media has shifted more and more to the\ninternet. The transformation in journalism, academia, and intellectual\ndiscourse more broadly has been especially dramatic.\n\nEconomically, computers have had their strongest impact on record-keeping and\nadministration, where they have been truly revolutionary. More and more\ncommerce is being done over the internet. Industrially, these technologies\u2019\neffects have also been substantial, but hardly overwhelming. Computerized\ntools such as articulated robot arms or CNC machine tools occupy very\nimportant niches. Thanks to tools like these as well as incremental efficiency\ngains from computerized administration, computers have helped industrial\nproductivity to continue its long-term growth, albeit at rates slower than\nthose seen in the first half of the 20th century. But the industrial effects\nof computers are not nearly as deep or as widespread as the industrial effects\nof famous earlier innovations such as interchangeable parts or Bessemer steel.\n\nThere are also the arguments that computers should be considered revolutionary\nbecause of predicted future changes. Mass automation will transform industrial\nproduction as deeply as the Industrial Revolution of old. The blockchain will\nusher in a new financial age. Swarms of autonomous combat drones will make\ninfantry obsolete. Chatbots will put the laptop class out of work. Unfriendly\nartificial general intelligence will disassemble humanity for parts. Perhaps\nreality will someday catch up to the think tank whitepapers and science\nfiction\u2014it wouldn\u2019t be the first time. Or perhaps belief in these hypothetical\ntechnologies will peter out like we\u2019ve seen in quests for the holy grails of\nprevious generations, like moon bases, fusion power, or the cure for cancer.\nPredicting the future of society is hard, and predicting the future of\ntechnology is even harder. Narratives which try to claim a special place for\ncomputers on the basis of predicted future technologies, which could arrive in\nten years or a hundred years or never, cannot play a role in our assessment of\nwhat computers have achieved so far.\n\nTaking all this together, in terms of the four-level scale above, I would rank\ncomputers at level 3. This judgment is necessarily a bit subjective, and I can\nimagine events developing so that in the year 2080 we look back and move the\nclassification up or down a notch. Still, this lets us put some bounds on the\ncomputer\u2019s importance relative to other technologies. Computers have changed\nour economy, but not nearly as much as the steam engine did. The internet has\nchanged our intellectual environment and structures of political legitimacy\nsomewhat more than the transition from radio to television, but much less than\nthe printing press. In short, computers are a big deal, and very probably the\nmost important technological development in living memory. But from the\nperspective of human history as a whole, the computer doesn\u2019t stand out. There\nhave been dozens of technologies that were at least as important, although\nprobably fewer than a hundred.\n\nThen why do so many people think computers are the most important\ntransformation ever? Because many of these commentators aren\u2019t trying to place\nthe development of computers within a firm understanding of the grand sweep of\nhistory. They\u2019re trying to explain their own direct experience of the world.\nIn their own lifetimes, computers were indeed the most revolutionary new\ntechnology, and compared to the things that they experience firsthand or spend\ntime thinking about, nothing else comes close. It\u2019s tempting to attribute big\nchanges to the most powerful force you\u2019ve experienced, and it\u2019s tempting to\nbelieve that the changes happening in your own lifetime are the most important\nin human history. Or sometimes people are trying to hype up new projects and\nproducts, which of course calls for boosting the present technology and\ngliding past the previous cases. But in either case, the reason their viewers\nand readers let them get away with it is that most people just don\u2019t know the\nhistory they\u2019re implicitly comparing to.\n\nTo take one personal pet peeve as an example, I have heard dozens and dozens\nof people describe how the internet has created never-before-seen problems in\njournalism, completely unaware that the unprecedented problems they describe\nwere just as bad or worse in the journalism of, say, the late 1800s. Of course\nit\u2019s perfectly fine to think about these things without knowing all the\nhistory, but making historical comparisons without knowing the history is\ndangerous. You don\u2019t need to know who Charles Sumner was before you say that\nnews media is more polarized today than it was in your childhood. However, if\nyou want to say that social media has made the discourse more fragmented and\nconspiracy-prone than ever before, you do need to know who Alfred Dreyfus was.\n\nComparisons like these are necessary to thinking about how dramatically\ncomputers have changed our world. Media and intellectual discourse have been\ntransformed many many times in modern history, and evaluating the scale of the\ninternet\u2019s changes requires a memory that goes back further than American\nmedia\u2019s golden age of the late 20th century. While anyone can and should\nobserve the very clear fact that computers are changing the economy, figuring\nout the significance of a \u201cFourth Industrial Revolution\u201d requires a\ncomfortable knowledge of the First. When you hear a claim that computers have\ncaused some gigantic change, you should ask yourself \u201cCompared to what?\u201d\n\nPlenty of common arguments cast computers and the internet as far more\ntransformative than they actually are, often through ignorance of history or\nthrough wildly overconfident predictions about the near future. Yet there\u2019s no\nneed to exaggerate. When taking the long view and properly comparing computers\nto other technologies, they are still a pretty big deal. We can think about\ntheir effects on society even if they haven\u2019t caused a fundamental\ntransformation.\n\nSubscribe to Ben Landau-Taylor\u2019s essays\n\nThis essay was originally posted on May 25, 2023.\n\n2 Likes\n\n2\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Computers Are Overrated\n\nwww.benlandautaylor.com\n\n1\n\nShare\n\n1 Comment\n\nRedbeardBarbarosa15 hrs agoI think you've got a point, but there are reasons\nto believe that the impact of computers is just beginning. I would agree with\na version of the thesis from \"The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of\nthe Bicameral Mind\" that there have been moments in human history where the\nnature of our interactions has changed sufficiently to completely transform\nwhat it means to be human. I think these changes are driven by technology, and\nthe sheer bandwidth of feedback we get from other humans has recently\nundergone a huge increase. We are starting to see some effects of this, but it\nis far from over.Expand full commentLikeReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nThe DDoS Attack Of Academic Bullshit\n\nNot long ago, during a discussion with a Zoomer colleague about how to find\nresearch material, I realized that he had never experienced internet search...\n\nApr 10 \u2022\n\nBen Landau-Taylor\n\n48\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The DDoS Attack Of Academic Bullshit\n\nwww.benlandautaylor.com\n\n14\n\nWhy We Can't Have Nice Things\n\nThe things around us have become plainer.
