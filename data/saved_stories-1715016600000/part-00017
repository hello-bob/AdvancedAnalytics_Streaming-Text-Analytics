He made his money co-founding businesses including a headphones and\nspeaker company, and this home is one of four properties he owns in Sweden and\nSpain.\n\nIt's not a surprising lifestyle for a successful entrepreneur, but what might\nsurprise global observers is how many people have become as wealthy as Mr\nBergstr\u00f6m - or even richer - in Sweden - a country with a global reputation\nfor its leftist politics.\n\nAlthough a right-wing coalition is currently in power, the nation has been run\nby Social Democrat-led governments for the majority of the last century,\nelected on promises to grow the economy in an equitable way, with taxes\nfunding a strong welfare state.\n\nMaddy Savage\n\nLiding\u00f6 island is home to a number of Sweden's super wealthy\n\nBut Sweden has experienced a boom in the super rich over the last three\ndecades.\n\nIn 1996, there were just 28 people with a net worth of a billion kronor or\nmore (around $91m or \u00a373m at today's exchange rate), according to a rich list\npublished by former Swedish business magazine Veckans Aff\u00e4rer. Most of them\ncame from families that had been rich for generations.\n\n  * BBC World Service - The Documentary Podcast, Super-rich Swedes\n\nBy 2021, there were 542 \"kronor billionaires\", according to a similar analysis\nby daily newspaper Aftonbladet, and between them they owned a wealth\nequivalent to 70% of the nation's GDP, a measure of the total value of goods\nand services in the economy.\n\nSweden - with a population of just 10 million - also has one of the world's\nhighest proportions of \"dollar billionaires\" per capita. Forbes listed 43\nSwedes worth $1bn or more in its 2024 rich list.\n\nThat equates to around four per million people, compared to about two per\nmillion in the US (which has 813 billionaires - the most of any nation - but\nis home to more than 342 million people).\n\n\"This has come about in a sort of a stealthy way - that you haven't really\nnoticed it until after it happened,\" says Andreas Cervenka, a journalist at\nAftonbladet, and author of the book Greedy Sweden, in which he explores the\nsteady rise of Sweden's super rich.\n\n\"But in Stockholm, you can see the wealth with your own eyes, and the contrast\nbetween super rich people in some areas of Stockholm and quite poor people in\nother parts.\"\n\nMiriam Preis\n\nJournalist and author Andreas Cervenka is an expert on Sweden's super rich\n\nOne reason for the rise of the new super rich is Sweden's thriving tech scene.\nThe country has a reputation as the Silicon Valley of Europe, having produced\nmore than 40 so-called unicorn start-ups - companies worth more than $1bn - in\nthe past two decades.\n\nSkype and Spotify were founded here, as well as gaming firms King and Mojang.\nMore recent global success stories include the financial tech start-up Tink,\nwhich Visa acquired for around $2bn during the pandemic, healthcare company\nKry, and the e-scooter company Voi.\n\nAt Epicenter - a shared office and community space with a giant glass atrium -\nveteran entrepreneur Ola Ahlvarsson traces this success back to the 1990s. He\nsays a tax rebate on home computers in Sweden \"wired or connected all of us\nmuch faster than other countries\".\n\nA serial co-founder himself, he also points to a strong \"culture of\ncollaboration\" in the start-up scene, with accomplished entrepreneurs often\nbecoming role models for - and investors in - the next generation of tech\ncompanies.\n\nSweden's size makes it a popular test market, too. \"If you want to see if it\nworks on a larger market, you can - at limited cost and without too much risk\nfor your brand or for your stock price - try things here,\" says Mr Ahlvarsson.\n\nBut Mr Cervenka argues there is another narrative that deserves more attention\n- monetary policies which he says have helped transform the country into a\nparadise for the super rich.\n\nSweden had very low interest rates from the early 2010s until a couple of\nyears ago. This made it cheap to borrow money, so Swedes with cash to spare\noften chose to invest in property, or high risk investments like tech start-\nups, many of which shot up in value as a result.\n\n\"One of the big factors that's driven this huge increase in billionaires is\nthat we've had, for a number of years, quite a strong inflation in the value\nof assets,\" says Mr Cervenka.\n\nAlthough top earners in Sweden are taxed more than 50% of their personal\nincomes - one of the highest rates in Europe - he argues that successive\ngovernments - on the right and left - have adjusted some taxes in a way that\nfavours the rich.\n\nThe country scrapped wealth and inheritance taxes in the 2000s, and tax rates\non money made from stocks and pay outs to company shareholders are much lower\nthan taxes on salaries. The corporate tax rate has also dropped from around\n30% in the 1990s to around 20% - slightly lower than the European average.\n\n\"You don't have to move out of Sweden if you're a billionaire today. And\nactually, some billionaires are moving here,\" says Mr Cervenka.\n\nBack on Liding\u00f6 island, Konrad Bergstr\u00f6m agrees that Sweden has \"a very\nfavourable tax system if you are building companies\". However he says his\nwealth has a positive impact because his businesses - and homes - provide\nemployment for others.\n\n\"We have a nanny and we have a gardener and cleaners... and that also gives\nmore jobs. So we shouldn't forget about how we're building the society.\"\n\nMr Bergstr\u00f6m points out that wealthy Swedish entrepreneurs and venture\ncapitalists are also increasingly reinvesting their money in so-called\n\"impact\" start-ups, which have a focus on improving society or the\nenvironment.\n\nIn 2023, 74% of all venture capital funding to Swedish start-ups went to\nimpact companies. This the highest percentage in the EU, and far above the\nEuropean average of 35%, according to figures from Dealroom, which maps data\non start-ups.\n\nPerhaps the country's most high profile impact investor is Niklas Adelberth,\nwho co-founded the unicorn payments platform Klarna. In 2017, he used $130m of\nhis fortune to launch the Norrsken Foundation, an organisation that supports\nand invests in impact companies.\n\n\"I don't have the habits of a billionaire in terms of having a yacht or a\nprivate jet or anything like that,\" says Mr Adelberth. \"This is my recipe for\nhappiness.\"\n\nMaddy Savage\n\nBillionaire Niklas Adelberth says he has no interest in yachts or private\nplanes\n\nBut others argue that Sweden is missing a nuanced public debate about\nbillionaire wealth, beyond a good-bad dichotomy of how entrepreneurs are\nspending their fortunes.\n\nRecent research from \u00d6rebro University concluded that the media image of\nSwedish billionaires is predominantly positive, and suggested that their\nfortunes are rarely explained in the context of the nation's shifting economic\npolicies.\n\n\"As long as the super-rich are seen to embody the ideals of the neoliberal\nera, such as hard work, taking risks, and an entrepreneurial attitude, the\ninequality behind this is not questioned,\" says media researcher Axel\nVikstr\u00f6m.\n\nMr Cervenka adds that debates about taxing the super rich are not as\npronounced in Sweden as they are in many other western countries, such as the\nUS.\n\n\"That's sort of a paradox. One would think that with our background - being\nperceived as a socialist country - this would be top of mind,\" says the\nauthor. \"I think it has to do with [the fact] that we have become more of a\nmentality of 'winner takes it all'.\n\n\"That, if you just play your cards right, you can also become a billionaire...\nAnd that's quite a significant shift, I think, in Swedish mentality.\"\n\nSweden's rich list also reveals that the nation's wealth remains largely\nconcentrated in the hands of white men, despite the country's large immigrant\npopulation and decades of policies championing gender equality.\n\n\"Yes, it's where people can create new money, create new wealth, but it's\nstill very closed and the double standards are quite high in terms of who gets\ntheir ideas funded,\" says Lola Akinmade, a Nigerian-Swedish novelist and\nentrepreneur. \"Sweden is an incredible country that's a leader in many ways,\nbut there's still a lot of people excluded from the system.\"\n\nSweden\n\nRelated\n\n## Eurovision hopefuls put on the style in Malmo\n\n13 hrs ago\n\nEntertainment & Arts\n\n## Eurovision 2024: Your guide to all 37 songs\n\n22 hrs ago\n\nEurope\n\n## Sweden prepares for Eurovision with heightened security\n\n2 days ago\n\nEurope\n\n## Let us know you agree to cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best online experience.\n\nPlease let us know if you agree to all of these cookies.\n\n  * No, take me to settings\n\n", "frontpage": true}
