Then it went up in\nflames.\n\nCheng Hwa\n\nJulia Shipley & Muriel Alarc\u00f3n\n\nPublished\n\n    Jan 04, 2024\n\nTopic\n\n    Climate + International\n\nShare/Republish\n\n    \n\nCopy Link Republish\n\nCopy Link Email SMS Twitter Facebook\n\nRepublish Reddit LinkedIn\n\nThis story was produced by Grist and co-published with El Pa\u00eds. A Spanish-\nlanguage version can be read here. Reporting was supported by the Joan Konner\nProgram in the Journalism of Ideas.\n\nOn the morning of June 12, 2022, \u00c1ngela Astudillo, then a law student in her\nmid-20s, grabbed her water bottle and hopped into her red Nissan Juke. The co-\nfounder of Dress Desert, or Desierto Vestido, a textile recycling advocacy\nnonprofit, and the daughter of tree farmers, Astudillo lives in a gated\napartment complex in Alto Hospicio, a dusty city at the edge of the Atacama\nDesert in northern Chile, with her husband, daughter, bunny, and three aquatic\nturtles.\n\nExiting the compound, Astudillo pinched the wheel, pulled over next to a car\non the side of the road, and greeted B\u00e1rbara Pino, a fashion professor, and\nthree of her students, who were waiting inside.\n\nThey headed toward a mountain of sand known as El Paso de la Mula. Less than a\nmile from her home, squinting into the distance, Astudillo saw a thread of\nsmoke rising from its direction. With her in the lead, the two vehicles\ncaravanned toward the dune, the site of the second-largest clothes pile in the\nworld.\n\nAs they got closer to El Paso de La Mula, the thin trail of smoke had expanded\ninto a huge black cloud. Astudillo stopped the car and texted the academics\nbehind her.\n\nIt looks like it\u2019s on fire. Hopefully, it\u2019s not there. :( :( :(\n\nShe then dialed them directly and asked, \u201cDo you still want to go?\u201d\n\nA Chilean flag stands in a traffic cone among burned piles of clothing in the\nAtacama Desert. Fernando Alarc\u00f3n\n\nPino, director of Santiago\u2019s Fashion System Observatory at Universidad Diego\nPortales, had planned this trip for months. Astudillo had volunteered to be\ntheir guide. The mound of discarded fabric in the middle of the Atacama\nweighed an estimated 11,000 to 59,000 tons, equivalent to one or two times the\nBrooklyn Bridge.\n\nBy the time the team reached the gates of El Paso de la Mula, more than half\nof the clothes pile was on fire. Smoke obscured everything, hanging like an\nopaque black curtain. Municipal authorities turned the group away, forbidding\nthem to stay on the premises. But Astudillo knew the landscape, so she\ndirected the team to the dune\u2019s far side, where access was still unimpeded.\n\nThere, the students surveyed the inferno. It was \u201clike a war,\u201d Pino said. She\nfelt waves of heat. Black smoke unspooled from the burning clothes. The air\nwas dense and hard to breathe. Smoke coated the back of their throats and\nclogged their nostrils with the acrid smell of melting plastic. They covered\ntheir faces, trying not to breathe it in. Then the group heard a series of\nloud pops as mini explosions burst from within the vast expanse of burning\ngarments.\n\n\u00c1ngela Astudilo holds a piece of discarded clothing from the Atacama Desert.\nFernando Alarc\u00f3n\n\nDespite the danger, Pino and her students rummaged, pulling out specimens to\nexamine from among unburned portions of the pile. On prior visits to the\nclothes dump, Astudillo had uncovered clothing produced by the world\u2019s most\nwell-known brands: Nautica, Adidas, Wrangler, Old Navy, H&M, Ralph Lauren,\nTommy Hilfiger, Forever 21, Zara, Banana Republic. Store tags still dangled\nfrom many of her findings. The clothes had come to the Atacama from Europe,\nthe United States, Korea, and Japan. Now, as Astudillo began taking pictures\nand uploading them to Instagram, Pino wandered the mound, horrified and\nfascinated by the grotesque volume and variety of apparel: ski jackets, ball\ngowns, bathing suits. She plucked out a rhinestone-encrusted platform stiletto\nin perfect condition. She crouched to search for its match, but the wind was\ngetting stronger. If it shifted, the team realized, they\u2019d be trapped in the\nspreading fire.\n\nFor 14 years, no rain has fallen in Alto Hospicio or the surrounding Atacama\nDesert region. Those dry conditions, coupled with the nonbiodegradable,\npredominantly synthetic, petroleum-derived fibers that modern clothes are made\nwith, meant that the pile never shrank. Instead, for more than two decades, it\ngrew \u2014 metastasized \u2014 with every discarded, imported item that was added.\n\nIn 2021, six months prior to the fire, a photographer from Agence France\nPresse, Mart\u00edn Bernetti, captured a bird\u2019s-eye image of this sprawling mound\nof apparel, essentially an oil slick, strewn across the edge of the Atacama\ndesert.\n\nThe aerial image was picked up by news outlets across the globe, from the\nfront page of the New York Post to the BBC, and continues to circulate today.\nBut the mountain of clothes depicted by that 2021 drone photo is utterly gone.\nAs Astudillo, Pino, and the three students witnessed, and unwittingly tasted:\nThe blaze tore through the pile, throwing black plumes of toxic ash into the\nair.\n\nAn aerial view of used clothes discarded in the Atacama Desert, in Alto\nHospicio, Iquique, Chile, on September 26, 2021. Martin Bernetti / AFP via\nGetty Images\n\nThe town of Alto Hospicio sits on a cliff above the Pacific Ocean, a bedroom\ncommunity for the seaside vacation city of Iquique below. Imagine if Atlantic\nCity in New Jersey were simultaneously hemmed in and backed by a high Nevada\nplateau, and if the two locales were connected by a two-lane switchback\nhighway.\n\nEach day in Iquique\u2019s port, giant cranes pluck containers full of discarded\nclothing from the decks of ships and deposit them onto flatbed trucks. No one\nreally knows exactly how much clothing passes through the port every year;\nestimates range from 60,000 to 44 million tons. Next, they head to the nearby\nFree Trade Zone, known locally as \u201cZofri,\u201d where trailers back into the\nwarehouses of 52 used-clothes importers and forklift operators transfer sealed\nbales of clothing, or fardos, inside.\n\nChile is the biggest importer of secondhand clothing in South America, and\nbetween 2020 and 2021 it was the fastest-growing importer of used clothing in\nthe world. The port of Iquique is an established tax-free zone, incentivizing\nthis booming industry of castaway textiles.\n\nA vendor in Iquique sells secondhand shoes. Muriel Alarc\u00f3n\n\nFrom Zofri, bales of clothing are sold, uninspected, to merchants betting that\nat least some of the items inside are sales-worthy. \u201cWhen you buy, you are\nbuying with your eyes closed,\u201d one former merchant said. Sometimes 80 percent\nof the garments in a bale are usable. Sometimes the opposite is true. Because\nbales are so cheap, however, most merchants need only sell 40 percent to turn\na profit.\n\nAccording to the global environmental advocacy group Ek\u014d (formerly known as\nSumofUS), an estimated 85 percent of the used clothing imported into Iquique\nremains unsold. Chilean federal law states it\u2019s illegal to dispose of\ntextiles.\n\nConsidered Iquique\u2019s backyard, Alto Hospicio is one of the poorest cities in\nChile, widely known as a place to abandon pets and dump trash. In the late\n1990s and early 2000s, the small desert town is where more than a dozen\nteenage girls mysteriously vanished, until their apprehended killer led\nauthorities to bodies buried in desert graves.\n\nManuela Medina, left, and her family pose for a photo near their clothing pile\nin the Atacama Desert. Fernando Alarc\u00f3n\n\nIn 2001, Manuela Medina*, a former gardener, saw an opportunity in Iquique\u2019s\ngrowing textile abundance. Relocating to Alto Hospicio, she established an\nunauthorized compound on government lands at the base of El Paso de la Mula,\nthe huge sand dune at the far side of an unregulated shantytown. Every few\ndays, she hired a fletero \u2014 a driver with a jalopy \u2014 to travel the switchback\nroads, out of the brown dunes of Alto Hospicio, to arrive in the colorful\noceanside city of Iquique, which sits a thousand miles north of the country\u2019s\ncapital, Santiago.\n\nNear the dock where cranes unload massive container ships, inside Iquique\u2019s\nfree trade zone, Medina ventured into the contiguous warehouses, asking\nsecondhand clothing importers, \u201cDo you have any garbage?\u201d\n\nBack at her compound, Medina unloaded her wares in piles on the ground where\nshe had the luxury of storing them indefinitely \u2014 the Atacama Desert is one of\nthe driest places on Earth, meaning items don\u2019t undergo normal degradation\nfrom elements like rain. Here, Medina sold her piles to merchants and others\nfor $10 each.\n\nAs more and more bales of ropa americana, or secondhand clothes, arrived in\nIquique, the clothes flooded importers\u2019 warehouses and overflowed vendors\u2019\nstalls in open air markets, including La Quebradilla \u2014 one of the largest open\nair markets in South America, located just a few miles from Medina\u2019s\nunauthorized compound.\n\nFernando Alarc\u00f3n\n\nSoon, importers and secondhand merchants began to deliver surplus used clothes\ndirectly to Medina. Fed by daily truck deliveries, and then by multiple daily\ntractor trailer load deliveries, Medina\u2019s pile grew.\n\nBy 2020, Medina\u2019s gargantuan desert dump had become an open secret in Chile,\nstretching across dozens of acres. Others followed her model, creating mini-\ndumps across the desert and along roadsides, but Medina\u2019s pile remained the\nlargest.\n\nOn March 29, 2022, Paulin Silva, an environmental lawyer, stood before the\nPrimer Tribunal Ambiental de Antofagasta, a regional tribunal in northern\nChile that specializes in resolving environmental issues within its\njurisdiction. She was presenting a lawsuit, brought on behalf of herself as a\nresident of Iquique, against the municipality and the federal Chilean\ngovernment for their inaction over the sprawling, unregulated clothes dumps.\nFor her submission of evidence, she asked the tribunal to join her in touring\nthe mound of clothing.\n\nPaulin Silva poses for a photo in an office. She has pushed the government to\ntake action on the illegal clothing dumps near Iquique, Chile. Fernando\nAlarc\u00f3n\n\nFor weeks, her informal team of supporters (a geographer, her sister, and her\nbrother-in-law) had been documenting the problem, joking among themselves, \u201cIn\nwhich dump are we going to party tonight?\u201d\n\nSince obtaining her law degree, Silva has prosecuted a handful of\nenvironmental cases, but this one was personal, and she felt empowered to\ntackle it: \u201cI have the education; I am a lawyer; I can do something,\u201d she\nsaid. She\u2019d grown up in northern Chile, a pencil thin country bordered by the\nPacific Ocean. Her father is from Alto Hospicio and her mother is from\nIquique. At 35, she\u2019s several years older than Astudillo, the co-founder of\nthe nonprofit Dress Desert, whom Silva asked to be a witness for the case.\nWhen Silva was a child, she observed people dumping clothes everywhere \u2014 the\nstreets, yards, and city squares. Because this was the only place she knew for\nso much of her life, she thought, \u201cIt\u2019s normal for people to live with ...\ngarbage accumulated around them.\u201d\n\nThis local \u201cclothes-blindness\u201d was documented by Astudillo\u2019s colleague,\nBasti\u00e1n Barria, an engineering student and her co-founder of Dress Desert. In\nNovember 2020, he and others conducted a survey to ascertain local attitudes\nregarding the clothing waste. Of the almost 400 people in Alto Hospicio he\nsurveyed, representing less than 1 percent of the town\u2019s population, more than\nhalf did not think there was any issue.\n\nWhen Silva was 18, she moved a thousand miles south, to Valparaiso in central\nChile, to study law and that was where she remained until the pandemic, when\nshe returned home. That\u2019s when she realized the dump situation had worsened.\nExponentially.\n\nShoes pile up in an illegal clothing dump in the Atacama Desert. Fernando\nAlarc\u00f3n\n\nDuring the decades between Silva\u2019s girlhood and today, clothing production\nworldwide doubled, while utilization \u2014 the number of times an item of clothing\nis worn before it is thrown away \u2014 declined by 36 percent. Countries like\nChile, Haiti, and Uganda became depositories for fast fashion discards. In\n2021 alone, Chile imported more than 700,000 tons of new and used clothing \u2014\nthe weight equivalent of 70 Eiffel Towers.\n\n\u201cEven if we stopped clothing production throughout the world tonight,\u201d said\nFrancisca Gajardo, an Iquique-born fashion designer, \u201cwe still have more\ngarments than we need or that the Earth can safely hold. It won\u2019t go away\nnicely, and we\u2019re not stopping today.\u201d\n\nNine days after the giant fires, around 4 p.m., Silva was having a light meal,\nthe Chilean equivalent of afternoon tea known as once (pronounced \u201con-say\u201d),\nwith her family in northern Chile. A few days prior, the Primer Tribunal\nAmbiental de Antofagasta had informed her it was ready to view her case\nevidence by touring the clothes pile in person. Silva took out her phone to\nshare the good news on Instagram with Desierto Vestido, but before she could,\nshe saw the images of the burning clothes Desierto Vestido had just uploaded\nand shared.\n\nSilva sprang from her chair to process what was happening to the evidence in\nher case just a few miles away. She suspected why the court had been willing\nto view the landfill: \u201cBecause obviously the matter was burned,\u201d she told\nGrist.\n\nWhile no official cause of the fires has ever been reported, local residents\nclaim it began late on Saturday night or in the early hours of Sunday. Days\nlater, toxic air still clung to the area. Astudillo, who visited the site\nregularly, described the pile as \u201cvolcanic\u201d \u2014 with clothes smoldering under\nthe sand, venting smoke full of textile chemicals from synthetic materials.\nShe warned, \u201cYou can\u2019t be outside for long.\u201d\n\nIn the days following the fire, on June 22, instead of leading the tour of the\nprosecutorial evidence, Silva filed a statement to the Primer Tribunal\nAmbiental de Antofagasta: \u201cWith sadness and shame I inform you that 11,000\ntons of clothes in the textile dump were burned.\u201d\n\nGraffiti in one of the most dangerous shantytowns in Chile, near Manuela\nMedina\u2019s home. The word \u201cvotar\u201d is likely supposed to be \u201cbotar,\u201d which in\nSpanish means \u201cthrow.\u201d But in its current form, it reads, \u201cDo not vote trash.\nIt will be reported.\u201d Fernando Alarc\u00f3n\n\nAlthough Paulin provided the court with Dress Desert\u2019s smartphone video\nrecordings of the clothes in flames, the defense argued that the Instagram\naccount where they\u2019d posted the videos could not be verified and confirmed.\nLacking a certifiable timestamp, the films were inadmissible.\n\nOne year later, in August 2023, the Primer Tribunal Ambiental de Antofagasta\ncalled a trial hearing so that all parties involved in the case \u2014 the Consejo\nde Defensa del Estado, the body that judicially represents the state in Chile,\nthe municipality of Alto Hospicio, and Silva \u2014 could present evidence.\n\nDuring the hearing, the Mayor at Alto Hospicio, Patricio Ferreira, said that\none of his priorities is to \u201ctransform this problem into an opportunity to\ngenerate employment.\u201d He alluded to discussions he had with European\nbusinessmen to explore initiatives related to recycling.\n\nSilva got people to testify in her favor, activists and academics who have\ngiven statements to different media outlets about the environmental problem\ngenerated by the textile landfill in the Chilean desert. But on the day of the\nhearing, none of them arrived.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, in practice, I am alone in this action,\u201d she said.\n\nChile\u2019s government recently voted to adopt recycling measures that make\ncertain producers accountable for their waste. Known as the extended producer\nresponsibility law, or REP using its Spanish acronym, the legislation passed\nin 2016 and took effect in January 2023. Currently, Chilean companies that\nmake tires and packaging (such as bags, plastics, paper or cardboard, cans and\nglass) must comply.\n\nEventually, according to the Ministry of the Environment, Chile intends to\nincorporate clothing and textiles as a priority product into the REP law.\n\nHowever, in the case of clothes, many describe the REP as a \u201cpaper solution\u201d\nthat lacks tangible enforcement, said Pino, from the Universidad Diego\nPortales.\n\nIn parallel, the Ministry of the Environment is developing a circular economy\nstrategy for textile waste. Unlike the REP, the agency crafts public policy\nfor the public and private sectors to prevent overproduction.\n\nThe ministry has been holding workshops and conversations to collect input\nfrom stakeholders, including academics, business executives, retailers and\nnonprofit leaders. It is also tabulating the results of a preliminary survey\non consumer clothes-buying habits. The details of this circular economy\nstrategy is expected to be published in March this year.\n\nAt the minister\u2019s invitation, Pino has shared her fashion expertise \u2014 both in\nthe markets and in the desert \u2014 with the group. \u201cThese two things are\nwonderful initiatives,\u201d she said about both efforts, but she lamented that\nthey fail to address the issue of used clothes.\n\nB\u00e1rbara Pino, director of the Fashion System Observatory, stands on the campus\nof the Universidad Diego Portales in Santiago, Chile. Fernando Alarc\u00f3n\n\nA decade ago, when the REP was first being discussed, Denisse Mor\u00e1n, president\nof the Tarapac\u00e1 Recyclers and the head of ServiREC, a recycling cooperative\nthat operates within Iquique\u2019s free trade zone, sought out her local\nrepresentative to request that the law apply to both clothing producers and\nclothing importers.\n\n\u201cOh, because you are from Iquique?\u201d she recalled him asking her.\n\n\u201cNot only because I am from Iquique,\u201d she replied, \u201cbut because we all wear\nclothes.\u201d\n\nFor years, many residents in Alto Hospicio saw the piles of textiles as more\nof an opportunity than an eyesore or environmental threat, something that\nsupported the local economy.\n\nWhen Jazm\u00edn Ya\u00f1ez arrived in town from southern Chile in 2018 almost penniless\nand on the brink of homelessness, for example, someone gave her a few cast-off\ngarments and household garbage \u2014 from towels, kitchen implements to furniture\n\u2014 to sell. Ever since, Ya\u00f1ez, now 28, has waged a zealous campaign to salvage,\nfix, and reutilize all \u201cwaste\u201d materials. She operates an informal store from\nthe kitchen of her house called Stop Recicla: \u201cYour trash is my treasure,\u201d\nwhere she sells, exchanges, and gifts items such as rugs, used clothing,\nschool supplies, costumes, and electronics to impoverished mothers, like she\nonce was.\n\nJazm\u00edn Ya\u00f1ez poses next to a pile of secondhand clothing that she will sell in\nher home-based store, Stop Recicla. Fernando Alarc\u00f3n\n\nIt\u2019s this trash/treasure duality that kept Astudillo and other locals from\nviewing the region\u2019s booming used clothing trade as a problem. But six months\nbefore the fires, in January 2022, Nathalia Tavolieri, a Brazilian journalist,\ninvited Astudillo to El Paso de La Mula, where she encountered Manuela\nMedina\u2019s mountain for the first time.\n\nAstudillo had seen numerous clothing dumps strewn and mounded throughout the\ndesert, but nothing as big as this immense tangle of blouses and pants. \u201cIt\nwas terrible,\u201d she said, weeping as she recalled her first visit. \u201cMaybe if I\nhad been older, maybe I could have done more things [to stop this from\nhappening].\u201d\n\nThe experience galvanized her. She had already co-founded her nonprofit Dress\nDesert, or Desierto Vestido, two years before, to raise awareness and\ncreatively respond to the country\u2019s burgeoning waste clothing issue. As part\nof the project\u2019s efforts, she and 20 other members host workshops and\nconversations. They upcycle castaway materials into new garments and craft\nhousehold items. Seeing the vastness of Medina\u2019s clothing pile, Astudillo\nstepped up her resolve, because \u201cmany people don\u2019t see \u2014 or don\u2019t want to\nsee.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was very, very hard,\u201d she said, \u201cto know that we live in a place that is\nso polluted and damaged by everyone\u2019s waste.\u201d Several months later, Astudillo\nbrought Gajardo, the clothes designer and a fellow Iquiquean, to the dump, and\ngained an ally in her efforts. Despite growing up and shopping at the region\u2019s\nnumerous outdoor secondhand clothes markets, Gajardo was appalled by the scope\nof the waste. She developed rashes from rummaging among the fabrics.\n\nA garment emerges in stages from the desert sand in the Atacama Desert.\nFernando Alarc\u00f3n\n\n\u201cThe fact that we have a desert, the fact that there\u2019s a place to receive\nthis, doesn\u2019t mean that the place has to become the dump of the world,\u201d she\nsaid. Since then, Gajardo\u2019s conviction to never design clothes from virgin\nmaterials has deepened. Additionally, through her brand You Are the New\nGeneration, she offers workshops in reusing garments, and visited Kansas City,\nMissouri, last year through the U.S. State Department\u2019s Young Leaders of the\nAmericas Initiative to teach people to make new clothes by harvesting old\nones.\n\nOther entrepreneurs have attempted to turn the clothes problem into revenue,\nbut have faced a series of setbacks.\n\nFranklin Zepeda is a celebrated Chilean entrepreneur who toured Europe\u2019s\ntextile recycling plants before returning to the region in 2013 to establish\nEcofibre, now known as Procitex. (Its name is an acronym meaning Proceso\nCircular en Textil in Spanish).\n\nWith seed funding from CORFO, the Chilean economic development agency, and\nlater from private capital, Zepeda was able to route textiles imported into\nIquique to his plant, where they were disassembled, shredded, doused with\nflame retardant, and transformed into insulation panels. Zepeda got praise for\nthis work in several major international news outlets, but he shuttered his\nplant in Alto Hospicio in 2021 because of unfavorable economics, including the\ntaxes on shipping the insulation panels to other regions of the country.\n\nDario Blanco, manager of the ZOFRI User Association AG (AUZ), a trade\nassociation that brings together businessmen from the Iquique free zone,\nbelieves that the solution to the region\u2019s problem of discarded clothing is\nout there \u2014 it will just take the right company and policies. And there are\nplenty of entrepreneurs, fashion designers, and environmentalists working on\nthe issue of textile waste, both in Chile and internationally.\n\nMen work at a factory that recycles used textiles discarded in the Atacama\nDesert for wooden isolation panels for the walls of social housing, in Alto\nHospicio, Iquique, Chile in 2021. Martin Bernetti / AFP via Getty Images\n\nAs Bloomberg reported in May, New York, California, Sweden, and the\nNetherlands are developing legislation similar to Chile\u2019s extended producer\nresponsibility law that went into effect this year, mandating that the fashion\nindustry fund recycling programs via tariffs calibrated to the quantity of\ngarments produced.\n\nIn order to help New York City uphold its existing law limiting or forbidding\ntextiles in the waste stream, FabScrap, a nonprofit founded in 2016 by a\nformer New York Department of Sanitation worker, receives 7,000 pounds of pre-\nconsumer textile waste each week. Sorted by volunteers, the nonsynthetic scrap\nitems are sent to a New Jersey facility that shreds the material, producing\n\u201cshoddy,\u201d a stuffing used to fill punching bags, sofas, and soft toys.\n\nA Czech company called RETEX has been attempting to bring its fabric-\nmacerating technology to Alto Hospicio. Blanco says that in exchange for\nsecuring a contract with Chile, the company promised to hire local workers.\nBut, Blanco admitted, negotiations like these have fallen through in the past.\nFor example, he said, a Spain-based company, Egreen, planned to open a fabric-\nwaste processing plant, but the deal was scrapped late last year.\n\nRead Next\n\nHow clothing forms the fabric of society, both past and future\n\nEve Andrews\n\nThe governor\u2019s sustainability adviser at the Regional Government of Tarapaca,\nPablo Zambra, recently formed a 25-member committee that includes stakeholders\nsuch as Astudillo and Barria from Dress Desert and Mor\u00e1n, the president of the\nTarapac\u00e1 Recyclers, to publicize economic incentives for circular economy\ninitiatives. Collectively, they hope RETEX will succeed in doing what Zepeda\u2019s\ncompany failed to do: turn a profit. As of this writing, no importers are\ninvolved.\n\nMeanwhile, every day, container ships continue to offload more cargo.\n\nIn the fall of 2022, Alto Hospicio\u2019s mayor, Ferreira, acknowledged the\nunsolved problem but blamed clothing manufacturers, citing a \u201clack of global\nawareness of ethical responsibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur land has been sacrificed,\u201d he said.\n\nPino agrees that the fashion industry and its consumers are culpable. \u201cWe have\nto worry about the complete cycle: before, during, and after our clothes,\u201d she\nwrote in an editorial published in 2021.\n\nShe believes a more comprehensive solution is necessary, including regulating\nthe entry of textile materials to Chile, educating consumers about prolonging\ngarments\u2019 lives, promoting Chile\u2019s homegrown fashion industry, and supporting\nresearch to design new uses for fabric waste.\n\nEcocitex, founded in 2020 by engineer Rosario Hevia in Santiago, has sprung up\nas another Chilean company addressing a surfeit of garments.\n\nEcocitex operates in a manner contrary to the country\u2019s organized and informal\nsecondhand clothes markets. It invites people to recycle high-quality clothing\nor pay $1.50 per kilogram to leave poor quality clothing and walk away empty-\nhanded.\n\nBasti\u00e1n Barria, co-founder of the organization Dress Desert with \u00c1ngela\nAstudillo, recently joined a government-sponsored committee to help push\nforward circular economy initiatives in Chile. Fernando Alarc\u00f3n\n\nDuring the pandemic, Andrea Espinoza P\u00e9rez, a civil industrial engineer at the\nUniversity of Santiago, initiated a study on the ecological impacts of\nprojects like Ecocitex. She wanted to know: Did factory-processed, used\nclothing produce fewer emissions than the original clothing manufacturing\nprocess? With data provided by Ecocitex\u2019s founder Hevia, scientists determined\nthat the clothes deconstruction process is effective because it keeps waste\nclothes out of landfills, and it replaces the demand for virgin materials.\nWhile Ecocitex\u2019s procedure is also energy-intensive, the study found, it uses\njust 73 percent of the energy required to produce the same product from raw\nmaterials.\n\nMeanwhile, neither Zepeda\u2019s Procitex nor Hevia\u2019s Ecocitex in Chile, nor\nFabscrap\u2019s efforts in New York and Philadelphia, have matched the direct\nprofitability of Medina\u2019s now-defunct business. (Medina has started a new\nbusiness storing tires.) In fact, all have relied heavily on a variety of\nunderwriting measures, including subsidies, nonprofit funding, subscriptions,\nor volunteer labor to generate their products.\n\nIn recent years, Zepeda has earned his living as an employee of Chile\u2019s\nlargest retailer, CENCOSUD. He collects surplus clothes donated by customers,\nand produces insulation panels for buildings that are sold by the same\nretailer.\n\nAs for Ecocitex, in June, the business caught fire and the building was\ndestroyed. The cause is still under investigation. Undeterred, Hevia has\nlaunched a campaign to rebuild. Meanwhile, she is raising funds by selling\nblankets made from recycled fibers to a mining company.\n\nBy last January, the height of the Chilean summer, the gigantic, unsightly\nclothes dump at El Paso de la Mula, the one Agence France Presse had shown the\nworld, was nowhere to be found.\n\nAll that remained was a smattering of ashes and the tread marks of bulldozers.\nHere and there, across Medina\u2019s unofficial backyard, small piles of garments\npeeked out of the sand dunes. But according to municipal officials, dumping\nand burning continues. Rey, an indigent man who lives by the side of a desert\nroad in a blue and yellow tent emblazoned with \u201cNational Geographic,\u201d attests\nthat he and others accept money from nonprofit refuse-disposal contractors or\nfreelance truckers in exchange for setting fires to whatever waste is\ndischarged from a truck. This way, the trucker can keep more of his hauling\nprofits, which would otherwise be whittled down by the official dump fees.\n\nIn the surroundings of Alto Hospicio, in the Atacama Desert, new landfills\nemerge every day. What arrives is burned by individuals living there. Some of\nthem receive payment for doing it. Fernando Alarc\u00f3n\n\nAstudillo says that beyond the limits of Manuela\u2019s dune, there are as many as\n200 micro-garbage dumps, and consequently, miles and miles of ashes in the\ndesert \u2014 not just scattered over the ground, but also in the air. She told\nGrist in late December that this is an everyday thing. \u201cYou go out to buy\nbread and you smell the burning smell. You smell the materials that make up\nthe clothes: oil and plastic. After 5 in the afternoon, I no longer let my\n7-year-old daughter leave the apartment, and I close the windows to prevent\nsmoke from coming in.\u201d She also confirmed the abandoning of clothes continues:\n\u201cThey throw it away, they burn it immediately.\u201d\n\nOn December 12, the Primer Tribunal Ambiental de Antofagasta issued its final\nruling in the case with Silva, commissioning a unit of experts to carry out an\non-site report on the accumulation of textile waste in different areas of Alto\nHospicio, and to propose a solution to the accumulation of waste.\n\nThe municipality of Alto Hospicio, which claims it does not have the workforce\nto adequately address the problem, has also installed nearly 100 cameras along\nthe main roads as a means of tracking polluters, and has begun doling out\nfines as high as $350 for illegal dumping. So far, trucks have been\napprehended transporting domestic and industrial garbage, as well as bulky\nitems such as mattresses, washing machines, and furniture.\n\nDrone footage recorded by Cheng Hwa, one of Pino\u2019s students, the day of the\nJune 2022 fires captures the municipality fighting what was in essence an oil\nfire. Hwa, who grew up in Iquique and now works in tech for the hospitality\nindustry, had long been aware of the desert dumps but didn\u2019t comprehend the\nmagnitude until he witnessed them at close range.\n\nFire blazes through Manuela Medina\u2019s clothes dump in the Atacama Desert on\nJune 12, 2022. Cheng Hwa\n\nHe\u2019s haunted by what his drone footage made visible. \u201cHow the desert of sand\nstarts to turn into a desert of clothes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has no limit; there is\nno closure ... Clothes begin to appear on the ground until the horizon is\ncompletely covered.\u201d\n\nIn Iquique, he often glances up toward the high plateau of Alto Hospicio. \u201cYou\ncan\u2019t see the dump, but [you can see] the column of smoke on days that\n[clothes] burn. That cloud of smoke lets you know ... It makes [the issue]\nvisible on a day-to-day basis.\u201d\n\nThirty miles south of Iquique, toward the city\u2019s main airport, on her family\u2019s\nfarm, Astudillo and her parents drop pieces of used clothing on the ground,\nbut in a purposeful way. Over the past 20 years, Astudillo\u2019s father has\nexperimented with growing trees in the infertile, saline soils. Many of his\nefforts failed until he began using certain fabrics to mulch his trees. This\nimproves the quality of the soil, enabling it to retain moisture. For the past\nyear, Astudillo has been working with one of the Zofri importers, who asked to\nremain anonymous. She consults with his staff about the clothing bales and\nrecommends ways of sorting the material into specific categories based on\nfiber content, some of which she collects personally. Those items \u2014 a pair of\ncotton shorts, a T-shirt, a blouse \u2014 become mulch for a pine and eucalyptus\nforest rising in the desert.\n\nRecently, as Astudillo was leaving the farm, she stashed a few perennials in\nher truck and drove them to Manuela\u2019s compound in Paso de La Mula. Just beyond\nMedina\u2019s courtyard, where sky- blackening fires had once burned, Astudillo\ntroweled a small hole for the plants. As she dug, she dislodged several odd\nsocks and a faded blue sweatshirt \u2014 discarded clothes that had survived the\nfires, but were buried by bulldozers.\n\nAstudillo filled the hole, amending the desert sand with compost and garden\nsoil. \u201cFor me it\u2019s like a Band-Aid for a wound that is so big in that place,\u201d\nshe said. Then she tucked in cardinal flowers \u2014 a native plant whose petals\nresemble shooting flames.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: During visits to her compound in Alto Hospicio, Manuela, the\nowner of the secondhand clothing dump, told Grist reporters her name was\nManuela Medina. However, other outlets have used the surname Olivos. Her legal\nname is Manuela de Los Angeles Medina Olivos.\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\nA message from\n\n#### All donations DOUBLED!\n\nGrist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable\nsolutions to climate change.
