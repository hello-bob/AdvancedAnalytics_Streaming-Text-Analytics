If your ideal customers\ncan be defined clearly by an industry vertical, job title, geographical\nlocation, company size, fundraising stage or other filterable criteria, our\nautomations will work perfectly for you. This can be very granular, e.g. \"Find\nme Finance Directors at companies with <100 employees based in Colorado who\nhave recently tried to hire Accountants\".\n\nWhere we are less well suited is when your customers have intangible,\ndifficult to filter characteristics: e.g. \"Find me couples looking to\ndivorce\". As few couples about to divorce would classify themselves this way\npublicly, it's hard for us to find them.\n\nHow does this compare to my existing lead gen provider?\n\nHyperscale searches across multiple major lead generation providers paired\nwith AI to get you the highest confidence contact details possible. Hyperscale\nalso performs deep research about each person to get you valuable insights\nabout a person beyond just their job title or company - leading to richer\nmessage personalization. Instead of paying for multiple lead gen providers and\nemail verification services, Hyperscale does all of that for you and only\ncharges credits when verified lead contact details are found, not per attempt.\nHow do we afford this expensive exercise? Scale.\n\nWhat is different about Hyperscale's personalization?\n\nMost platforms already have a trendy \"Generate with AI\" button where you would\nmanually click each email that will go out, or it will generate some template\nthat will still look bland and impersonal such as \"Hi [first_name], I see you\nare [job_title] at [company]\" which quickly ends up in spam.\n\nHyperscale automatically personalizes every outgoing tailoring whatever you're\npitching to their specific background. This means having an AI that can sell\nice to Eskimos tailor every single message based on what the AI discovered\nabout the person during its research.\n\nRest assured, you can still edit every message before it goes out.\n\nHow does message generation work?\n\nWe use our proprietary models paired with cutting-edge Large Language Models\nsuch as OpenAI's GPT-4 (the latest version of what is commonly known as\nChatGPT) and Anthropic's Claude to generate personalized message drafts. We\ntailor these messages to each customer by prompting the model with each\ncustomer's public profile information. We also fine-tune these models with\nyour edited message drafts and the messages that generate the most responses.\nThis way, your messages will sound more and more like you over time, and also\nyield better responses.\n\nCan I control the messages I send out?\n\nYes, you can check, edit, rewrite or delete every single message before they\ngo out. You can also deactivate a campaign at any time, so you are always in\ncontrol.\n\nDo you integrate with our CRM?\n\nYes, for Pro and Growth plan users, your data can then be integrated into any\nmainstream CRM. You can also export your data into a .csv at anytime.\n\nHow do you count credits in my subscription?\n\nCredits are consumed when: a lead is successfully found, a message is\npersonalized, and a message is sent. Each lead typically includes all public\nprofile information (e.g. headline, occupation, profile summary, location,\neducation/work experience etc.) and work contact information (e.g. work emails\nwith a score for likely accuracy).\n\nIs there a minimum contract or refund policy?\n\nYour subscription will remain active at its current level until the end of the\nbilling period that you've already paid for. We do not offer refunds.\n\nFeatures\n\nUse Cases\n\nPricing\n\nAbout\n\n\u00a9 2024 Hyperscale. All rights reserved.\n\nTermsPrivacyDisclaimerBlogBecome an Affiliate\n\n", "frontpage": false}
