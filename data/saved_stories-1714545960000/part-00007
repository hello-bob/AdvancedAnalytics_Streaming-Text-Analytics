In\n> this paper, we address dog vocalizations and explore the use of self-\n> supervised speech representation models pre-trained on human speech to\n> address dog bark classification tasks that find parallels in human-centered\n> tasks in speech recognition. We specifically address four tasks: dog\n> recognition, breed identification, gender classification, and context\n> grounding. We show that using speech embedding representations significantly\n> improves over simpler classification baselines. Further, we also find that\n> models pre-trained on large human speech acoustics can provide additional\n> performance boosts on several tasks.\n\nComments:| to be published in LREC-COLING 2024  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.18739 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.18739v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.18739arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Artem Abzaliev [view email] [v1] Mon, 29 Apr 2024 14:41:59 UTC (858 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Towards Dog Bark Decoding: Leveraging Human\nSpeech Processing for Automated Bark Classification, by Artem Abzaliev and 2\nother authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
