This process has been ongoing for years, with recent\nsatellite data revealing an accelerated sinking rate of several millimeters to\none centimeter per year. This sinking is attributed to both natural geological\nfactors and human activities, particularly the excessive depletion of\naquifers. The rapid urbanization in China in recent decades seems closely\nlinked to the accelerated pace of subsidence in the region. Approximately 300\nmillion urban Chinese are witnessing the ground sinking beneath their feet.\n\nA few years back, a team of scientists highlighted numerous land subsidence\nevents worldwide. Many were pinpointed in China\u2019s densely populated regions.\nRecently, Chinese researchers used an advanced tool similar to LIDAR (Light\nDetection and Ranging) to monitor terrain-elevation changes in 82 cities with\nover two million residents. The InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture\nRadar) system on the European Space Agency\u2019s Sentinel-1 satellite can detect\nminuscule altitude variations for each terrain pixel, equivalent to 40 x\n40-meter surface grids. Since 2015, they\u2019ve tracked changes using satellite\ndata and recently published the study\u2019s findings in Science.\n\nThe study found that 44.7% of large Chinese cities are sinking at a rate of at\nleast three millimeters per year, affecting about 270 million urban residents.\nAdditionally, 15.8% of the area is sinking even faster, with nearly 70 million\npeople impacted by rates exceeding 10 mm/year. Some urban areas sink as much\nas 2.2 centimeters annually. Tianjin, with over 15 million residents, leads\nthe list of the most heavily affected cities. The sinking cities are mainly in\nthe eastern and southern parts of China, areas that have driven the country\u2019s\nmodernization in recent decades.\n\nThe accelerated sinking is caused by human activities, primarily the depletion\nof aquifers. When water is extracted faster than it can be replenished, empty\nspaces form underground, leading to land subsidence. The study linked the\ndepletion rates of 1,619 Chinese aquifers to the extent of land subsidence in\nnearby cities. Another significant factor is the vertical expansion of new\ncities \u2014 tall, heavy buildings also contribute to subsidence. The study found\nthat newer and taller buildings experience more sinking. Highways and heavy\ntraffic also exert pressure on the ground, causing subsidence. In Beijing,\nareas near roads are sinking up to 45 millimeters annually. Practices like\nhydraulic fracking for hydrocarbon extraction and mining also impact land\nsubsidence. In Pingdingshan, a coal-rich industrial city, the land is sinking\nby over 10 centimeters per year.\n\n> When an area sinks uniformly under infrastructure, there is no angular\n> distortion. The problem is when subsidence is not uniform.\n>\n> Roberto Tom\u00e1s, Alicante University (Spain)\n\n\u201cVenice is sinking at a rate of 1.6 millimeters a year,\u201d said Roberto Tom\u00e1s, a\nprofessor at Alicante University (Spain) and an expert in subsidence and civil\nengineering. \u201cFor comparison, Lorca and the Guadalent\u00edn valley were sinking\n100 millimeters annually (now down to 80) due to groundwater extraction.\u201d\nAquifer exploitation in this part of Murcia, Spain, has led to the most severe\ncase of subsidence in Europe. Tom\u00e1s says a three-millimeter annual rate isn\u2019t\nconcerning, but 10 millimeters certainly is. \u201cThat\u2019s a rate of one centimeter\nper year, 10 centimeters in a decade.\u201d Tom\u00e1s helped develop a global\nsubsidence map showing its worldwide scope, and says it aligns with factors\ncausing subsidence in Chinese cities: \u201cSoft sediments, the sprawl of urban\ndevelopment, cities popping up out of nowhere with all the infrastructure, all\nthe people and their water demands.\u201d\n\nTom\u00e1s, who is part of a UNESCO team on subsidence, highlights the significance\nof \u201cdifferential settlement\u201d \u2014 when one part of a structure\u2019s foundation\nsettles faster or more than another. He says we should pay closer attention to\nuneven soil sinking rather than just the total amount. \u201cWhen an area sinks\nuniformly under infrastructure, there is no angular distortion. The problem is\nwhen subsidence is not uniform.\u201d He offers two examples in Spain that he has\nstudied extensively: Lorca and Murcia. Lorca sinks more than any other urban\narea in Europe, \u201cbut there is no damage to buildings because it\u2019s a uniform\nsubsidence.\u201d The opposite happens in the city of Murcia. In the 1990s, he\nhelped prepare a report identifying 150 buildings in Murcia with significant\ndamage from uneven sinking that would cost \u20ac150 million ($163 million) to\nremedy.\n\n> Favorable geological environments like deltas and floodplains are abundant\n> in China, and even more so in South Asia, Southeast Asia and East Asia.\n>\n> Robert J. Nicholls, Tyndall Center for Climate Change Research\n\nRobert J. Nicholls is the director of the Tyndall Center for Climate Change\nResearch, a partnership between the universities of East Anglia, Cardiff,\nManchester, Newcastle and Fudan University in Shanghai. He argues that\nsubsidence isn\u2019t a worldwide issue in the strictest sense. \u201cSubsidence only\noccurs where geological conditions allow. Favorable geological environments\n[for subsidence] like deltas and floodplains are abundant in China, and even\nmore so in South Asia, Southeast Asia and East Asia. In these areas, urban\npressure and groundwater extraction contribute to subsidence, among other\ncauses,\u201d he says.\n\nThe Science study predicts that China\u2019s coastal cities will sink below sea\nlevel in the next 100 years. Over half of the 82 cities studied are located by\nthe sea or just a few kilometers away. This presents a dual challenge: land\nsubsidence and rising sea levels due to climate change. The outcomes hinge on\nactions taken to address both issues. To combat land subsidence, a highly\neffective method used in Murcia\u2019s valleys since the 1970s was adopted by Osaka\nand Tokyo, cities that halted their sinking by replenishing more water than\nthey extracted. Under worst-case climate scenarios and without mitigation\nefforts, a quarter of China\u2019s coastal urban areas could resemble Venice and\nNew Orleans by 2120.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage\nfrom EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition\n\n### More information\n\n### New York moves to update its fracking ban to include liquid carbon-dioxide\nas well as water\n\nAP | Albany (New York)\n\n### Groundwater depletion accelerating in many parts of the world, study finds\n\nAP | Washington\n\n### Archived In\n\n  * China\n  * Murcia\n\nAdheres to\n\nMore information\n\nIf you are interested in licensing this content, please contact\nventacontenidos@prisamedia.com\n\nSponsored Content\n\nTreppenlift-Vergleich\n\nRentner in Riesa: So kosten Treppenlifte fast nichtsTreppenlift-Vergleich|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nForge Of Empires\n\nWenn du \u00fcber 45 Jahre alt bist, wirst du dieses Strategiespiel 2024\nliebenForge Of Empires|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nCheckfox\n\nNeuigkeiten aus Sachsen: Staat \u00e4ndert Solar-VorgabenCheckfox|\n\nPatrocinadoPatrocinado\n\nAnd Also...\n\nGaza protests at US universities deepens division among DemocratsEl Pa\u00eds\n\nAS\n\nIranian soccer player suspended and fined for hugging a womanAS\n\nAS\n\nShaq\u2019s prediction if the Lakers are eliminated in the PlayoffsAS\n\n_\n\n### newsletter\n\nSign up to EL PA\u00cdS in English Edition bulletin\n\nAp\u00fantate\n\n### Most viewed\n\n  1.
