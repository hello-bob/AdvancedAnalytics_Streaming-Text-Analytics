Wildfires charred more\nthan 18.5 million acres across the continent, with the most land burned in\nCanada and California.\n\nA new study has revealed the extent to which human-caused climate change\nintensified the extraordinary event, with researchers theorizing the heat dome\nwas 34% larger and lasted nearly 60% longer than it would have in the absence\nof global warming. The heat dome, in turn, was associated with up to a third\nof the area burned in North America that year, according to the study,\npublished in Communications Earth & Environment.\n\n\u201cWhat happens is you get a stagnated weather pattern \u2014 it\u2019s very hot and very\ndry,\u201d said study author Piyush Jain, research scientist with Natural Resources\nCanada. \u201cAnd it dries out all the vegetation and makes whatever is on the\nground extremely flammable.\u201d\n\nAggressive and impactful reporting on climate change, the environment, health\nand science.\n\nExplore our new section\n\nThe study adds to a body of literature documenting how the fingerprints of\nclimate change can be detected in events such as heat waves, droughts and\nwildfires.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJain was living in Edmonton in late June 2021 when the mercury in North\nAmerica\u2019s northernmost million-resident city topped 100 degrees. \u201cI was blown\naway,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d never experienced those temperatures anywhere I\u2019d lived.\u201d\n\nFarther south, the town of Lytton, British Columbia, on June 29 experienced\nCanada\u2019s hottest recorded temperature, 119 degrees, and was largely destroyed\nby a wildfire the next day.\n\nThe heat dome persisted for a staggering 27 days, from June 18 to July 14,\nwith skyrocketing temperatures across the western United States and Canada\nkilling hundreds of people, resulting in mass die-offs of marine life,\ndevastating crop and timber yields and damaging infrastructure, buckling\nhighways in Washington and melting train power lines in Portland. Over a five-\nday period in June, locations in seven U.S. states, including California,\nsurpassed all-time maximum temperature records, according to the National\nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nThe heat wave also ratcheted up fire danger, breaking a slew of fire weather\nrecords over a broad area and helping to stoke blazes in British Columbia,\nCalifornia, Arizona, Colorado, Utah and Montana. More than 7.9 million acres\nburned in North America in July alone \u2014 at that time, the greatest area in a\nsingle month since record-keeping began, according to the study. Smoke\ntraveled across the continent, triggering air quality alerts across much of\nthe East Coast.\n\nClimate & Environment\n\n### Yes, beavers can help stop wildfires. And more places in California are\nembracing them\n\nBeavers create unburned islands where plants and animals can shelter from\nmegafires, research has confirmed. A movement is afoot to reintroduce the\nrodents to the state\u2019s waterways.\n\nMarch 26, 2024\n\nJain had previously worked with other researchers to develop a method for\nevaluating such extreme weather events by looking at anomalies in geopotential\nheights, which indicate whether there are high or low pressure systems in the\nupper atmosphere. High pressure systems that persist for a long time tend to\ncorrespond with heat waves and increased fire risk, he said. And climate\nchange has contributed to a trend of rising heights, potentially magnifying\nthese events.\n\nIn this study, Jain and his colleagues analyzed what the heat dome would have\nlooked like without this trend. They estimated that it would have been 34%\nsmaller, 59% shorter and had a 6% lower magnitude.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe researchers also found strong links between the extreme heat and wildfire\nactivity in 2021. That year, 21% of the land burned in North America was\nscorched by fires that started during and within the heat dome, with that\nfigure rising to 34% when taking into account fires that started within 10\ndays, the researchers found.\n\nThe size of the heat dome made it particularly troubling because it resulted\nin what the study authors called widespread synchronous burning, with many\ndisparate areas igniting at the same time. That posed a challenge to fire\nagencies because they tend to ask for help from other places when they don\u2019t\nhave enough resources locally.\n\n\u201cIf other areas are also experiencing the same resource strain, you can reach\na bottleneck at some point,\u201d Jain said.\n\nWhen there aren\u2019t enough resources to attack fires when they first start,\nblazes that might have otherwise been snuffed out when they were small grow\nlarge and difficult to contain, resulting in the need for yet more resources,\nsaid John Abatzoglou, a professor of climatology at UC Merced who also worked\non the study. If this type of synchronous activity persists in future years,\nit could force fire managers to reevaluate the reliability of resource-sharing\narrangements, he said.\n\nThe study did not look specifically at how the heat dome, which extended into\nNorthern California, affected the state\u2019s fire season. That summer, the\n963,000-acre Dixie fire, which started July 13, became the first to burn from\none side of the Sierra Nevada to the other, followed in short order by the\n221,000-acre Caldor fire.\n\nIn general, it\u2019s difficult to completely attribute a fire to any individual\nfactor, because flames are often fueled by a complex interplay of conditions \u2014\nanything from overstocked forests to wind, Abatzoglou said. Still, in 2021,\nCalifornia had its hottest June to July in the observational period, and\nresearchers have established a strong relationship between warm, dry summers\nand area burned in the state\u2019s forests, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously difficult to say how much the heat dome itself was responsible\nfor those fires,\u201d Abatzoglou said. \u201cBut based on the hellaciously warm\ntemperatures in that month, the significant heat wave events, we can say that\nthose conditions certainly helped enable fuels to become incredibly available\nand provided less resistance to fire, once a fire started.\u201d\n\nClimate & Environment\n\n### How large fires are altering the face of California\u2019s Mojave Desert\n\nLast year\u2019s York fire has sparked discussion about how to deal with\nconflagrations in the Mojave National Preserve.\n\nMarch 19, 2024\n\nThe findings add to the understanding of how climate change can affect extreme\nweather events \u2014 and the potential role these events can play in fire\nactivity.\n\n\u201cThis is the latest in a growing body of evidence about the causes of wildfire\nconditions globally but in particular in western North America,\u201d said Noah\nDiffenbaugh, a climate scientist at Stanford University who was not involved\nin the study. \u201cI think this, in particular, is an advance in linking record-\nbreaking fire weather conditions to the specific atmospheric conditions for a\nspecific event.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s important to untangle climate change\u2019s influence on extreme weather\nevents like the heat dome, which are increasing in frequency and intensity,\nDiffenbaugh said. A lot of infrastructure and risk management systems are\nbuilt around assumptions about how these events will play out, so if that\nchanges, those systems become stressed, he said.\n\n\u201cThe linking, through this careful analysis, of the contribution of climate\nchange to the record-breaking fire weather conditions associated with the heat\ndome is a really great example of the kind of research that we need to\naccurately quantify the risk of climate change,\u201d Diffenbaugh said. \u201cBoth the\nclimate change that we\u2019re already living with, and the climate change that we\ncan expect to happen in the future, even if the world\u2019s ambitious global\nwarming goals are achieved.\u201d\n\nClimate & Environment\n\n### After winter storms, California can expect a late start to the wildfire\nseason\n\nForecasters are anticipating a late start to California\u2019s wildfire season, but\nthey can\u2019t yet say whether it will be severe.\n\nMarch 8, 2024\n\nStudies that attempt to quantify the role of climate change in individual\nevents can also help calculate the health costs and financial toll of\nplanetary heating from carbon emissions, which have been cited by a growing\nnumber of lawsuits seeking damages.\n\nLearning under what conditions these events occur can also help people\nunderstand how a warming climate can lead to more extremes in the future, Jain\nsaid.\n\nAnd all indications suggest that that future is approaching quickly. Since the\nstudy was written, Canada\u2019s 2021 wildfire season was dwarfed by that of 2023,\nwhich saw more than 45 million acres burn. Jain now has a preprint examining\nhow heat waves played a role. Although there was no single event as extreme as\n2021\u2019s heat dome, some regions of Canada saw many more heat events than on\naverage, he said.\n\n\u201cSo 2023 was not dominated by a single event, but when you looked overall at\nthe number of these events that occurred, it was a very extreme year in terms\nof heat waves,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, of course, 2023 was the warmest year on record\nglobally.\u201d\n\n### More to Read\n\n  * ### Editorial: If 10 straight months of record-breaking heat isn\u2019t a climate emergency, what is?\n\nApril 17, 2024\n\n  * ### How climate change contributes to wildfires like Chile\u2019s\n\nFeb. 6, 2024\n\n  * ### Opinion: No matter the weather, climate change means it\u2019s always \u2018fire season\u2019\n\nJan. 14, 2024\n\nClimate & EnvironmentCaliforniaFiresGlobal Warming\n\nAlex Wigglesworth\n\nFollow Us\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Instagram\n  * Email\n  * Facebook\n\nAlex Wigglesworth is an environment reporter who covers wildfire and forestry\nfor the Los Angeles Times.\n\n### More From the Los Angeles Times\n\n  * Climate & Environment\n\n### The first big-rig hydrogen fuel station in the U.S. opens in California\n\nApril 24, 2024\n\n  * Climate & Environment\n\n### Los Angeles makes progress but earns 25th-straight F in air quality\n\nApril 24, 2024\n\n  * Climate & Environment\n\n### California wants to harness more than half its land to combat climate\nchange by 2045.
