The money represented the bulk of the K\nFoundation's funds that had been previously earned by Drummond and Cauty as\nthe KLF.\n\nThe event was recorded on a Hi-8 video camera by K Foundation collaborator\nGimpo. On the one year anniversary of the burning, 23 August 1995, the film\nwas released as Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid and was toured\naround the UK, with Drummond and Cauty engaging audiences in debates about the\nburning and its meaning. In November 1995, the duo pledged to dissolve the K\nFoundation and to refrain from public discussion of the burning for a period\nof 23 years; Drummond subsequently made the decision to discreetly speak about\nthe burning in 2000 and 2004. Initially, he was unrepentant, but in 2004 he\nadmitted that he regretted burning the money. The self-imposed moratorium\nofficially ended on 23 August 2017, 23 years after the burning, when Cauty and\nDrummond hosted a debate asking \"Why Did the K Foundation Burn a Million\nQuid?\" during their \"Welcome to the Dark Ages\" event.\n\nCollaborator Chris Brook edited and compiled a book, K Foundation Burn A\nMillion Quid, which was published by Ellipsis Books in 1997. It compiles\nstills from the film, accounts of events and viewer reactions, and an image of\nthe brick that was manufactured from the fire's ashes. A film consisting of a\nstatic three-minute shot of the brick, \"This Brick\", was shown at London's\nBarbican Centre prior to Drummond and Cauty's performance as 2K in the same\nyear.\n\n## Background[edit]\n\nAs The KLF, Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty were the biggest-selling singles act\nin the world for 1991.^[1] They had also enjoyed considerable success with\ntheir album The White Room^[2] and a number one hit single \u2013 \"Doctorin' the\nTardis\" \u2013 as The Timelords.^[3] In February 1992, The KLF staged an incendiary\nperformance at the BRIT Awards,^[4]^[5] and retired from the music industry\nshortly thereafter in typically enigmatic fashion.^[6]^[7]\n\nBy their own account, neither Drummond nor Cauty kept any of the money they\nmade as The KLF; it was all ploughed back into their extravagant productions.\nCauty told an Australian Big Issue writer in 2003 that all the money they made\nas The KLF was spent, and that the royalties they accrued post-retirement\namounted to approximately one million pounds:\n\n> I think we made about \u00a36m. We paid nearly half that in tax and spent the\n> rest on production costs. When we stopped, the production costs stopped too,\n> so over the next few months we amassed a surplus of cash still coming in\n> from record sales; this amounted to about \u00a31.8m. After tax we were left with\n> about \u00a31m. This was the money that later became the K Foundation fund for\n> the 'advancement of kreation.'^[8]\n\nInitially The KLF's earnings were to be distributed by way of a fund for\nstruggling artists managed by the K Foundation, Drummond and Cauty's new post-\nKLF art project, but, said Drummond, \"We realised that struggling artists are\nmeant to struggle, that's the whole point.\"^[9] Instead the duo decided to\ncreate art with the money. Nailed to the Wall was the first piece of art\nproduced by the Foundation, and the major piece in their planned art\nexhibition, Money: A Major Body of Cash. Consisting of one million pounds in\ncash nailed to a pine frame, the piece was presented to the press on 23\nNovember 1993 during the buildup to the Foundation's announcement of the\n\"winner\" of their \"worst artist of the year award\", the K Foundation art\naward.^[10]^[11]\n\n## Decision and burning[edit]\n\nDuring the first half of 1994, the K Foundation attempted to interest\ngalleries in staging Money: A Major Body of Cash, but even old friend Jayne\nCasey, director of the Liverpool Festival Trust, was unable to persuade a\nmajor gallery to participate. \"'The Tate, in Liverpool, wanted to be part of\nthe 21st Century Festival I'm involved with,' says Casey. 'I suggested they\nput on the K Foundation exhibition; at first they were encouraging, but they\nseemed nervous about the personalities involved.' A curt fax from [...] the\ngallery curator informed Casey that the K Foundation's exhibition of money had\nbeen done before and more interestingly\",^[12] leaving Drummond and Cauty\nobliged to pursue other options. The duo considered taking the exhibition\nacross the former Soviet Union by train and on to the United States, but no\ninsurer would touch the project.^[12] An exhibition at Kilmainham Jail in\nDublin was then considered, but no sooner had a provisional August date been\nset for it than the duo changed their minds yet again. \"Jimmy said: 'Why don't\nwe just burn it?' remembers Drummond. 'He said it in a light-hearted way, I\nsuppose, hoping I'd say: 'No, we can't do that, let's do this...' But it\nseemed the most powerful thing to do.\"^[12] Cauty: \"We were just sitting in a\ncafe talking about what we were going to spend the money on and then we\ndecided it would be better if we burned it. That was about six weeks before we\ndid it. It was too long, it was a bit of a nightmare.\"^[13]\n\nThe journey from deciding to burn the money to deciding how to burn the money\nto actually burning the money was a long one. Jim Reid, a freelance journalist\nand the only independent witness to the burning, reported the various schemes\nthe K Foundation considered. The first was offering Nailed to the Wall to the\nTate Gallery as the \"1995 K Foundation Bequest to the Nation.\" The condition\nwas that the gallery must agree to display the piece for at least 10 years. If\nthey refused, the money would be burnt. A second idea was to hire Bankside\nPower Station, \"the future site of the Tate Gallery extension and an imposing\nbuilding downstream from the South Bank\", as a bonfire venue. In typical KLF\n'guerrilla communication' style, \"posters were to appear on 15 August bearing\nthe legend 'The 1995 K Foundation Bequest to the Nation', under which would\nhave been an image of Nailed to the Wall on an easel and two flame-throwers\nlying on the floor. On 24 August a new poster would go up, exactly the same as\nthe first except that this time the work would be burnt.\"^[12]\n\nThe Boathouse on the Ardfin Estate where the K Foundation burnt \u00a31 million\n\nThe K Foundation's ultimate resolution for their one-million-pound \"problem\"\nwas rather less showbiz, but dramatic nonetheless, the Foundation having\ndecided that making a public spectacle of the event would lessen its impact.\nOn 22 August, Reid, Drummond, Cauty and Gimpo touched down at Islay Airport in\nthe Inner Hebrides and took a ferry to the island of Jura, previously the\nscene of a wicker man burning ceremony by The KLF.^[12] Early in the morning\nof 23 August 1994, in an abandoned boathouse on Jura, Drummond and Cauty\nincinerated the money. The burning was witnessed by Reid, who subsequently\nwrote an article about the act for The Observer, and it was filmed on a Hi-8\nvideo camera by collaborator Gimpo. As the burning began Reid said he felt\nguilt and shock. These feelings, he reported, quickly turned to boredom.^[12]\n\nThe money took well over an hour to burn as Drummond and Cauty fed \u00a350 notes\ninto the fire. According to Drummond, only about \u00a3900,000 of the money was\nactually burnt, with the remainder flying straight up the chimney.^[14] Two\ndays later, according to Reid, Jimmy Cauty destroyed all film and photographic\nevidence of the burning. Ten months later, Gimpo revealed to them that he had\nsecretly kept a copy.^[12]\n\n## Film[edit]\n\nWatch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid starts with a short description of\nthe event, and then consists of Drummond and Cauty throwing \u00a350 notes onto the\nfire. Burning the entire amount takes around 67 minutes. NME wrote:\n\n> At the start, Cauty is agitated and says he doesn't think the money will\n> burn because it is too wet. The camera shows 20 thick bundles of \u00a350 notes,\n> each bundle containing \u00a350,000 in new bank notes and sealed in cellophane.\n> When the money ignites, Drummond starts to laugh as he and Cauty stand above\n> a small fireplace throwing \u00a350 notes on to the fire. Cauty constantly stokes\n> the blaze with a large wooden plank and at one stage burns his hand on a\n> flaming note. As the fire starts to dim, he scuttles around the floor\n> sweeping stray notes into the flames. The cameraman shows a view from\n> outside the building with charred \u00a350 notes billowing out of the\n> chimney.^[13]\n\nIn November 1995, the BBC aired an edition of the Omnibus documentary series\nabout The K Foundation entitled A Foundation Course in Art (usually\nmislabelled as The K Foundation Burn a Million Quid online). Amongst the\nfootage broadcast were scenes from Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid.\nThomas Sutcliffe, reviewing the programme in The Independent, wrote:\n\n> The Omnibus film about this intriguing pair was in part a rear-guard action\n> in their continuing battle for recognition (and a victory \u2013 for some people,\n> after all, art is what appears on Omnibus). It was also a peculiarly modern\n> fable about what constitutes an artist \u2013 will the artist's say-so do, or do\n> you need the validation of the galleries? \"You can't simply decide you're\n> going to become an artist,\" said one gallery owner haughtily, which left you\n> wondering how else the vocation might operate. A lottery system? Secret-\n> ballot election? For my money (meagre though it is), the video which\n> recorded the laborious process of immolation was a decidedly intriguing work\n> \u2013 rather more provoking than some contemporary work I've seen. For\n> established galleries, the medium used (video, bank-notes, fire) is\n> obviously an embarrassment, but if poverty of material is not to disqualify\n> artworks (bricks or lard, say) why should the expense of material?^[15]\n\nA still of the film from the book K Foundation Burn a Million Quid\n\n### Screening tour[edit]\n\nThe first public screening of Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid was\non Jura on 23 August 1995 \u2013 exactly one year after the burning. \"We feel we\nshould face them and answer their questions\" said one of the duo.^[16] Two\nweeks later an advert appeared in The Guardian, announcing a world tour of the\nfilm over the next 12 months at \"relevant locations\".^[17] The second\nscreening was at In the City music industry convention on 5 September in\nManchester.^[18] After the film was shown, Drummond and Cauty held a question-\nand-answer session with the theme \"Is It Rock'n'Roll?\".^[13]^[19]^[20] A week\nlater, the pair travelled as guests of alternative radio station B92 to\nBelgrade, where the post-screening discussion was titled \"Is it a crime\nagainst humanity?\" An unauthorised screening at the BBC Television Centre was\ncurtailed and Drummond and Cauty were escorted from the building.^[20]\n\nOn the weekend of 3 November 1995, the film was screened at several locations\nin Glasgow,^[9] including at football matches involving Celtic and Rangers; a\nplanned screening at Barlinnie prison was cancelled after the Scottish Prison\nService withdrew permission.^[21]^[22] Glasgow's artistic community broadly\nseemed to welcome the screenings.^[23] A further public screening on Glasgow\nGreen on 5 November was announced by various newspapers,^[20]^[22]^[24] but\nthere is no record of the showing having ever occurred. The K Foundation\ndisappeared from Glasgow; they later issued a statement that on 5 November\n1995 they had signed a \"contract\" on the side of a Nissan Bluebird - which had\nthen been pushed over the cliffs at Cape Wrath in northern Scotland^[25] -\nagreeing to wind up the K Foundation and not to speak about the money burning\nfor a period of 23 years.^[26]\n\nDespite the K Foundation's reported moratorium, further national screenings of\nthe film organised by Chris Brook took place as planned. At each screening,\nDrummond and Cauty announced they would not answer questions after the film;\ninstead, they would ask questions of the audience. These screenings were held\nin Bradford, Hull, Liverpool, Jamaica Street Studios, Cheltenham Ladies\nCollege, Eton College, Aberystwyth, Glastonbury Tor, Alan Moore's front room\nand Brick Lane, London.^[27]\n\nThe Brick Lane screening \u2013 on 8 December 1995 \u2013 had been previewed in NME, and\nwas chaotically busy. It was originally planned for a car park, but freezing\nconditions and snow forced a rethink and the screening was moved indoors, to\nthe basement of the nearby Seven Stars pub. Hundreds of people crammed in to\nwatch the screening, which was eventually abandoned partway through due to the\ncramped conditions.^[28] The NME preview had claimed that after the screening\nthe film would be cut up and individual frames sold off to the public.^[29]\nGimpo, the owner of the film, had no intention of doing so, but after the\nscreening was nearly overwhelmed by a mob of people wanting to take home a\npiece of the film.^[28]\n\n## End of the moratorium[edit]\n\nDrummond and Cauty ended their self-imposed moratorium on 23 August 2017, 23\nyears after the burning.^[30]^[31] \"Why Did the K Foundation Burn a Million\nQuid?\" was debated during \"Welcome to the Dark Ages\", a three-day festival\ncelebrating the launch of their novel 2023: A Trilogy.^[32]\n\n## Burning as a theme[edit]\n\nEllipsis' K Foundation-style advert promoting the book K Foundation Burn a\nMillion Quid\n\nRitualistic burnings had already been a recurring aspect of Drummond and\nCauty's work. In 1987, the duo disposed of copies of their copyright-breaching\ndebut album\u2014The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu's 1987 (What the Fuck Is Going\nOn?)\u2014by burning them in a Swedish field.^[33] This event was pictured on the\nback sleeve of their second album, Who Killed The JAMs?, and celebrated in the\nsong \"Burn the Bastards\".^[34] During the 1991 summer solstice, they burnt a\n60 feet (18 m) wicker man on Jura,^[35] as chronicled in the KLF movie The\nRites of Mu.^[12]\n\nAs the K Foundation, Drummond and Cauty threatened to burn the K Foundation\nart award prize money (Gimpo was fumbling with matches and lighter fluid when,\nat the last moment, Rachel Whiteread accepted the prize).^[9]^[36] In the\nseventh K Foundation press advert they asked \"What would you do with a million\npounds? Burn it?\"^[37]\n\n## Reaction and analysis[edit]\n\nJim Reid's piece appeared in The Observer on 25 September 1994. This is \"one\nof the most peculiar stories of the year\", he cautioned readers. \"Peculiar\nbecause pretty much everyone who comes across this magazine is going to have\ntrouble believing a word of it. Peculiar because every last dot and comma of\nwhat is to come is the truth.\" \"It took about two hours for that cash to go up\nin flames\", he added. \"I looked at it closely, it was real. It came from a\nbona fide security firm and was not swapped at any time on our journey. More\nimportantly, perhaps, after working with the K Foundation I know they are\ncapable of this.\"^[12]\n\nThe Daily Express ran the story on 1 October 1994. They reported that charred\n\u00a350 notes were being found by islanders, who did not doubt the burning had\nreally taken place. Drummond and Cauty had been seen eating in a hotel bar on\nJura before leaving with two suitcases, the newspaper reported.^[38]\n\nThe Times followed with essentially the same story on 4 October 1994, adding\nthat the burning \"[had] left many on the island bewildered, incredulous and\nangry\". \u00a31,500 had been handed in by a local fisherman to Islay police:\n\"Sergeant Lachlan Maclean checked the money with both banks on Islay and with\nCustoms and Excise, who pronounced it genuine. 'I telephoned Mr Drummond in\nLondon and told him the money had been found. I asked him if it was his. He\nsaid he would get in touch with his partner, Mr Cauty. So far he has not\ntelephoned back'\".^[39]\n\nThe media returned to the story in earnest in October and November 1995,\npreviewing and then reviewing Foundation Course in Art, and reporting on the K\nFoundation's tour screening Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid.\n\nAn October 1995 feature quoted Kevin Hull, the BBC documentary maker\nresponsible for the Omnibus item, saying he had found \"the boys rather\ndepressed, and almost in a state of shock\". \"Every day I wake up and I think\n'Oh God, I've burnt a million quid and everyone thinks it's wrong'\", Cauty\ntold him.^[24]\n\nA piece in The Times on 5 November 1995, coinciding with the Glasgow\nscreenings, reported that the K Foundation had no solid reason for burning the\nmoney or view of what, if anything, the act represented, but concluded \"The K\nFoundation may not have changed or challenged much but they have certainly\nprovoked thousands to question and analyse the power of money and the\nresponsibilities of those who possess it. And what could be more artistic than\nthat?\"^[21] In the same issue, the newspaper's K Foundation art award witness,\nRobert Sandall, wrote that the Foundation's award, million-pound artwork and\nthe burning were all \"entertaining, and satirically quite sharp\", but \"the art\nworld has chosen not to think [of it as art].... The general view remains that\nthe K Foundation's preoccupation with money, though undoubtedly sincere,\nsimply isn't very original. Although they didn't blow their entire life's\nsavings along the way, other artists, notably Yves Klein and Chris Burden,\nhave been here before.\"^[20]\n\nThe Guardian's TV reviewer was sceptical. \"Snag is, the K men have always\ndealt in myth and sown a trail of confusion, so nobody quite believes they\nreally burned the money. And if they did, they must be nuts.\"^[40]\n\n### Later reaction[edit]\n\nIn the following years, the burning was mentioned regularly in the press, with\nDrummond and Cauty often relegated to a cultural status of \"the men who burnt\na million quid\".\n\nA February 2000 article in The Observer newspaper again insisted that the duo\nreally had burnt one million pounds. \"It wasn't a stunt. They really did it.\nIf you want to rile Bill Drummond, you call him a hoaxer. 'I knew it was\nreal,' a long-time friend and associate of his group The KLF tells me,\n'because afterwards, Jimmy and Bill looked so harrowed and haunted. And to be\nhonest, they've never really been the same since'\".^[41]\n\nA 2004 listener poll by BBC Radio 6 Music saw The KLF/K Foundation placed\nsecond after The Who in a list of \"rock excesses\".^[42]\n\nDrummond's former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Julian Cope was unimpressed, claiming that Drummond\nstill owed him money. \"He burned a million pounds which was not all his, and\nsome of it was mine. People should pay off their creditors before they pull\nintellectual dry-wank stunts like that.\"^[43]\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\nOn 17 September 1997, a new film, This Brick, was premiered. The film\nconsisted of one three-minute shot of a brick made from the ashes of the money\nburnt at Jura. It was shown at the Barbican Centre prior to Drummond and\nCauty's performance as 2K.^[44]\n\nOn 27 September 1997, K Foundation Burn A Million Quid (ISBN 0-9541656-5-9,\nISBN 1-899858-37-7 paperback) was published. The book, by Chris Brook and\nGimpo, contains stills from the film and transcriptions of various Q&A\nsessions from the tour. It also includes a timeline of K Foundation activity\nand sundry essays including one from Alan Moore. Publisher Ellipsis promoted\nthe book with an advert modelled on those of the K Foundation \u2013 \"Why did\nEllipsis publish K Foundation Burn A Million Quid?\" they asked.^[45]\n\nInitially, Drummond was unrepentant, telling The Observer in 2000 that he\ncouldn't imagine ever feeling regret unless his child was ill and only \"an\nexpensive clinic\" could cure him.^[41] By 2004, however, he had admitted to\nthe BBC the difficulty of explaining his decision.^[46] \"It's a hard one to\nexplain to your kids and it doesn't get any easier. I wish I could explain why\nI did it so people would understand.\"^[47]\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"Quid\" is a widely used British slang word meaning pounds sterling (singular or plural: \"a quid\", \"a million quid\").\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Bush, John.
