The advertising is\npresented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change\nactions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that\nthey are in an urban zone.\n\nA large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online\nadvertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its\naudience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and\navoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles\nabout how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been\npresented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.\n\nVendors43 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * Adform\n  * Advanced store\n  * Amazon Ad Server\n  * Appier\n  * AudienceProject\n  * Bannernow\n\n1-10 / 43\n\nCreate profiles for personalised advertising\n\nInformation about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit,\ncontent you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about\nyou (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and\nother websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or\nimprove a profile about you (that might include possible interests and\npersonal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present\nadvertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by\nthis and other entities.\n\nIf you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this\ninformation could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike\naccessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a\ndifferent website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike\naccessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury\ncar manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your\ninterest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are\ninterested in luxury cycling gear.\n\nAn apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It\ngets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income\ncustomers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create\nprofiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to\nhave a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising\nwithin partner apps based on those profiles.\n\nVendors129 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * A.Mob\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdElement Media Solutions\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * AdSpirit AdServer\n  * AdTheorent\n  * AdTiming\n\n1-10 / 129\n\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\n\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising\nprofiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or\napps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and\npersonal aspects.\n\nAn online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It\nwants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on\nits mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have\npreviously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present\nyou with the corresponding advertisement on the app.\n\nA profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having\nsearched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant\nadvertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.\n\nVendors127 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * A.Mob\n  * ADventori\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdElement Media Solutions\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * AdSpirit AdServer\n  * AdTheorent\n\n1-10 / 127\n\nMeasure advertising performance\n\nInformation regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you\ninteract with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for\nyou or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For\ninstance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you\nto buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand\nthe relevance of advertising campaigns.\n\nYou have clicked on an advertisement about a \u201cblack Friday\u201d discount by an\nonline shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click\nwill be linked to this purchase.

The publisher wants to have reports to understand how\noften a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the \u201cinternational\nappreciation day\u201d ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in\norder to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad\nplacements.\n\nVendors76 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * Adelaide\n  * Adform\n  * Adikteev\n  * Adloox\n  * Adnami\n\n1-10 / 76\n\nUnderstand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different\nsources\n\nReports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user\nprofiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your\ninteractions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising)\ncontent to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which\ntarget audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).\n\nThe owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the\nproportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or\nconsulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as\nthe average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data\nrelating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics\nis then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.\n\nAn advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with\nits adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics\nof users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of\nsimilar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the\nadvertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile\ndevices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.\n\nVendors28 vendor(s)\n\n  * AdGear\n  * Amazon Ad Server\n  * Amobee (Nexxen)\n  * Appier\n  * AudienceProject\n  * Bombora\n  * Clinch\n  * Crimtan\n  * Emerse\n  * Google Ads\n\n1-10 / 28\n\nDevelop and improve services\n\nInformation about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with\nads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to\nbuild new products and services based on user interactions, the type of\naudience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or\nimprovement of user profiles and identifiers.\n\nA technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in\nmobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are\nconnecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads\nthat are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve\ntheir performance.\n\nAn advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer\ndevice.

It\u2019s not clear when the word was\ncoined, but it seems to have started catching on around 15 years ago to\nsuggest an intricate structure formed of people with overlapping deep\nattachments: romantic, sexual, sensual, platonic. It\u2019s difficult to describe a\npolycule. Words like \u201cfamily\u201d and \u201cnetwork\u201d are used, but neither on its own\ncaptures it. Perhaps it\u2019s best left to a polycule itself to offer\ndescriptions. These are the voices and images of people who are part of a\npolycule in the Boston area.\n\nThese photographs were taken at a gathering of the polycule in Cambridge,\nMass., in March. Some people pictured or interviewed asked that they not be\nidentified and are using a middle name or a nickname.\n\n## Describing the Polycule\n\nKatie The polycule is like this weird family.\n\nAnn It\u2019s chosen family. It works like complex kinship networks work \u2014 just a\nlittle kinkier. It reflects radical queer values.\n\nKatie Our polycule is large, 20 or a little more \u2014 people in their mid-20s to\nmid-40s. There are self-identified males who identify as heteroflexible,\nheterosexual, bisexual. There\u2019s a nonbinary person. Every femme-presenting\nperson or woman identifies as queer. A lot of people are married and have\nprimary partnerships. They\u2019re coming to it from the opening of a monogamous\nrelationship.\n\nAshley A bunch of couples met in the summer of 2020. Over the next year, we\nwere all dating and developing friendships with several couples and\nindividuals that eventually blossomed into this community. It\u2019s an evolving\norganism that looks entirely different from everyone\u2019s perspective.\n\nAnn It\u2019s definitely not a fixed or closed thing, and the relations and\nconnections have shifted and grown and continue to do so.\n\nNico Our polycule is female-run. It\u2019s the female-identified people who\nspearhead. We convene, we plan, we call the shots. It\u2019s a bunch of queer women\nwho say we\u2019re not going to follow the rules.\n\nKatie It\u2019s freedom. I am so grateful to be a part of it. I have this abundance\nof love to give. I feel so in my power. We all approach ENM, ethical\nnonmonogamy, differently. Everyone is so deeply in love with each other,\nwhether or not it\u2019s romantic love.\n\nKatie (left) is dating Alex (second from left). Alex is legally married to\nAshley (third from left). Chris (lower right) is legally married to Bine (not\npictured), and Chris and Bine date Alex and Ashley as couples, while Bine has\nalso dated Ashley individually.\n\n## Relationships With More Than One Person\n\nKatie I started by dating somebody on an ENM app who was in a different\npolycule who was connected to someone in this polycule. And then I started\ndating someone else in this polycule. He\u2019s married, and his wife and I are\nmetamours, which is simply a word for my partner\u2019s partner. People have\nestablished relationships, people have newer relationships, and there are\nabiding deep friendships that are sometimes sensual, sometimes sexual,\nsometimes romantic, sometimes platonic.\n\nM (Katie\u2019s main partner) I identified as a single guy. I went from that to\ndating nonmonogamously. And I fell in love with someone who was already in\nlove with more than one other person. The fear of abandonment that I\u2019d been\nprogrammed from Day 1 to expect, I had a huge amount of stress about that. And\nof expressing too much anxiety. I spent a lot of time suffering alone during\nthe first months because I didn\u2019t want to overwhelm my new partner and have\nthem realize, Hey, you know what, this is just too much of a pain in the ass,\nand I need you to do more work to reach the level where you need to be.\n\nNico I was enthralled in college with gender-studies theory. I started to\narticulate that I was queer. I identify anywhere from femme to nonbinary,\ndepending on the day. My pronouns are she/they. Gender studies is where I\nrealized that nonmonogamy was an option. I had a professor who showed us this\nwheel about the accepted forms of sexuality and gender identity, and at the\noutside of the wheel were all the forms that aren\u2019t accepted. And I was like,\nOh, I fall into the outside.\n\nAnn I\u2019m 34, and I feel like I\u2019ve been on and off nonmonogamous much of my\nlife, even though I didn\u2019t have the word. When I was 17, 18, I said free love.\nAround 2018, 2019, I swore off monogamy forevermore. I use the word\n\u201cpolyamorous,\u201d though relationship anarchist is probably a more accurate\nrepresentation.\n\nMy husband and I are very, very different, which is our strength. He\u2019s a frat\nbro who loves sports, and I\u2019m a radical alien witch academic nerd. In the\nbeginning, we did all the typical stuff. Read the books on nonmonogamy, did\nthe relationship check-ins. We\u2019d sit down, take notes. We did every exercise\nin the books, listened to every podcast. We learned a strategy from the\nMultiamory podcast called \u201cagile scrum,\u201d which was adapted from business-\nmeeting models. We utilized that format. We did that for a year and a half, at\nleast once a month, sometimes six to 10 hours of hard poly-processing. That\ngave us great communication tactics.\n\nRobert (Ann\u2019s husband) We have this motto: Feelings are not facts. That gets\nus through the hard times.\n\nAt the start, I was going through some depression, and when we had sex I had\nso much stress. There were issues in the bedroom with her, and that happened\nmany times, which caused more stress. She started seeing this dude who was an\nabsolute stud, having sex with him and having a great-ass time, and I felt\ntotally lame and inadequate.\n\nThat was really hard for me, for obvious reasons. I felt like, I\u2019m a hundred\npercent replaceable. It took a lot of conversations. She was like, There\u2019s\nnothing wrong with you, this is going to pass, therapy will help. Lots of\ntears were shed. But medication helped me, talk therapy helped me, changing\nthe way we do things helped. That\u2019s where feelings are not facts really\nmattered. Because I would ask her questions, and she would be like, No, I\ndon\u2019t feel that way; and I would be like, I know you like being with him more\nthan me; and she would say, I\u2019m not lying to you, it\u2019s different, but it\ndoesn\u2019t make me love you less, you provide so much more to my life than just\nsex. I totally get it now. That was the first instance of feelings are not\nfacts. They feel like it. But they ain\u2019t facts.\n\nBine and Chris. They sometimes date Ann and Robert as couples.\n\n## Setting Boundaries\n\nBine My husband and I met about 15 years ago as undergrads, fell in love and\ndecided to get married. We had discussed opening up our relationship to a\npotential third, because I identified as bi, and that was important to me. And\nthen five years into our marriage, he was the one to start talking about\nethical nonmonogamy. At that point we were saying, Let\u2019s just have some fun,\nbut ours is really the primary relationship.\n\nThere were a lot of restrictions. I felt very insecure, like if we\u2019re going to\ndo this there\u2019s going to have to be a laundry list of rules. It can be a one-\nnight stand, but we\u2019re not going to see this person again. It can\u2019t be a\nfriend. But it became clear that these rules didn\u2019t make any sense. We felt\ndeeper connections with people beyond the sexual. We had to shift things, and\nwe kind of drifted into the polyamorous space in 2018.\n\nResources always help, books like \u201cThe Ethical Slut\u201d and \u201cPolysecure.\u201d But\nundoing the monogamous script, the socialization, is really, really difficult.\n\nKatie There\u2019s a lot of boundary-setting. Broken rules can be really damaging.\nAdhering to other people\u2019s boundaries is a big part of being in the polycule.\nThat\u2019s paramount. In the polycule, it ranges from people who really don\u2019t have\nrules to we\u2019re only going to date people together or we\u2019re going to\nparticipate in the group only as friendships, or as sensual friendships, or\nwe\u2019re only going to be sexually intimate at gatherings, and outside of that\nwe\u2019re not going to date anyone individually. We keep track in group chats. We\nalso gather as a group for parties that are sometimes intentionally sexual but\nsometimes not at all, and that is a time for people to communicate about their\ninterests. But group chats are big.\n\n\u2018\u2018It\u2019s an evolving organism that looks entirely different from everyone\u2019s\nperspective,\u2019\u2019 one person who is part of the polycule says.\n\n## Making Time for Multiple Partners\n\nM The capacity to love is not a finite thing. But time is. You can\u2019t do two\nthings at once.\n\nBine Scheduling can be very tricky. Making sure there\u2019s still one or two\nevenings every week when we spend quality time together. Overnights is\nsomething we\u2019re discussing now. We don\u2019t sleep over individually with anyone\nwe\u2019re dating; we only do that when we\u2019re dating someone together.\n\nAnn My husband, my nesting partner, is the person I own a home with. I also\nhave life-partnership friends, I call them my wives, who are core members in\nthe polycule. One of their husbands is one of my best friends and occasional\nsexual partner, and I do have sex with my wives, but we\u2019re not romantically\ninvolved. But I love them.\n\nI don\u2019t ask anyone\u2019s permission on anything. I spend 60 percent of my time in\nmy house with my nesting partner and about 25 percent of my time with another\npartner, and although I technically have one home right now, I\u2019m in the\nprocess of building homes with multiple partners. There are check-ins, but the\ncheck-ins aren\u2019t for permission. It\u2019s, I\u2019m doing these things, I\u2019m going to be\ngone for these two weeks, what do you need from me?\n\nKatie Poly-saturation is different for different people. For me, the maximum\nseems to be three partners at once, especially because I gravitate toward\nlong-term committed in-depth relationships. I mean romantic partners. We have\nplay parties that are intended to be a sexual space but more of a casual\nconnection, and I\u2019m not only with my partners there.\n\nNico and her husband, Fred, photographed in Cambridge, Mass.\n\n## Benefits of the Polycule\n\nRobert We have a lot of compersion \u2014 being happy seeing your partner happy\nwith one of their other partners \u2014 for each other. There are times when my\nwife will meet someone she knows I\u2019ll be attracted to, and she\u2019ll say, You\nhave to meet my husband. She\u2019ll wingman me. Or I\u2019m talking to this guy, and I\nthink, She would really like this guy. We do that for each other.\n\nBine There\u2019s something that feels radical about it, that feels liberating,\nthat really speaks to empowerment, especially for women or queer or nonbinary\nindividuals. It\u2019s loving people in a very unapologetic way, not conforming to\nnorms. We know why monogamy is still the dominant structure. The patriarchy.\nThe lack of rights women had. As a woman, and as a queer woman, being able to\nlive my life as authentically as possible without needing my husband\u2019s\npermission, that\u2019s empowering.\n\nNico I was in a very bad car accident in the fall, and I felt so supported. I\nhad 20 text messages from people in the polycule \u2014 this is the doctor I know,\nthis is the lawyer I have, this is the physical therapist, so many resources.\n\nAnn I have one partner now with three kids. He is transmasc, and he\u2019s radical\nabout the way he raises them. They\u2019re radically home-schooled. They\u2019re 17 and\nnonbinary, 6 and 5. They know everything in age-appropriate ways. They\u2019ve seen\ntheir mommy undergo the transmasc experience, seen their mom become who they\nreally are.\n\nI was up late last night with him in a hotel room, and the 17-year-old was in\nthe room snoozing, so we just sat on the bathroom floor chatting about our\nrelationship all night, and while that was happening my husband was texting to\nsay, Oh, I got a last-minute match, so I\u2019m going to meet this girl for a date.\nAnd then I get a text while we were still on the bathroom floor vibing, it was\n4 in the morning, and he said, We had a great date, a great connection, she\u2019s\nlooking for friends with benefits, we had sex. And I was smiling. You know\nyou\u2019re really poly when you\u2019re with one of your partners talking about how\nmuch you love each other and you\u2019re so happy your husband had this awesome\nnight. Of course, I experience pangs of jealousy, but there are these moments,\nthese gems, of being so happy for someone else\u2019s happiness.\n\nKatie Last night I was at a party that was full of poly people, and at the end\nof the night we wound up in this big cuddle pile. There were eight of us fit\ntogether like puzzle pieces, snuggling. It felt so cozy, so much oxytocin\nflowing. We were all envisioning living together, not having to worry about\nindividual mortgages, just having some big house. Can\u2019t we just do that? Why\ncan\u2019t we do that? An adult sleepover camp, that\u2019s the vibe. It is my mission\nto make that happen for me and whoever wants to join me.\n\nAshley and her husband, Alex, photographed in Cambridge, Mass.\n\n## Poly as an Identity or a Movement or Both\n\nAshley Whenever you veer outside the confines of the status quo, it is\npolitical. We\u2019re really intentional about the way we want to connect, really\nquestioning why one type of relationship has to be more significant than\nothers. For the first time in my life, I\u2019ve found community, in a true sense.\nThese are people who really show up for each other in beautiful ways, people\nwho aren\u2019t guarded around each other. It\u2019s just pure love. I can\u2019t imagine my\nlife without it now.\n\nAnn It is very much about social change. It is about making the world a better\nplace. I want to be in relationships and be with people who make me live in\nthis world better.\n\nNico Some of us are survivors of sexual assault and have reclaimed what it\nmeans to be a sexual woman, to be radically and unapologetically ourselves.\nSome don\u2019t really ever have sex \u2014 I think there is a power in female sexuality\nthat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean having a lot of sex; I don\u2019t know how to explain\nthat. It\u2019s about making decisions for yourself, how you want your\nrelationships to look.\n\nThe men are important; they do have value. What has been valuable is being\naround men who want to be around empowered women, who aren\u2019t intimidated. It\u2019s\nnot like they\u2019re wimpy guys \u2014 to me, they\u2019re strong because they\u2019re not\nthreatened.\n\nThere are so many things we\u2019re pushing against, but we still have to live\nwithin. My husband and I married for the legal benefits, for taxes and things\nlike that. Our society\u2019s laws benefit married people. But I\u2019ve talked to my\ngirlfriend about us being married as well, and while that can\u2019t be legal right\nnow, we would like to have that for ourselves, maybe a small ceremony, rings\non the other hand, something that signifies our bond and our life commitment.\nIn Somerville, which is the city right next to mine, the city legally\nrecognizes multiple domestic partners. I think our society is moving toward\nthat, but it\u2019s a slow process.\n\nKatie I hope this is a social movement. I hope people will feel more freedom\nabout how they want to live and about pooling resources and living their best\nlife. The structure of the nuclear family, the nuclear marriage, needs to\nshift. It\u2019s really hard to afford a house. Some of us are thinking of moving\ninto a place with four or five bedrooms where eight or nine of us could live\ntogether. We could share the burden of bills. It\u2019s just more realistic. And it\nwould be a community space. We would hold events and gather and play and have\nthis endless sleepover. If I get to do this, I will have achieved something\ngreat \u2014 great emotionally and great in terms of social transformation.\n\nThe polycule's parties are sometimes intentionally sexual but sometimes not at\nall.\n\nInterviews have been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nDaniel Bergner is a contributing writer for the magazine and the author of\n\u201cThe Mind and the Moon: My Brother\u2019s Story, the Science of Our Brains and the\nSearch for Our Psyches.\u201d Anne Vetter is a photographer based in Los Angeles\nand Wellfleet, Mass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nEnjoy unlimited access to all of The Times.\n\nSee subscription options\n\n", "frontpage": false}
