That\u2019s because\nthose words go against everything we stand for,\u201d County Executive Johnny\nOlszewski said at a press conference.\n\n\u201cHate has no place and no home in Baltimore County. Nor should it have any\nplace across our state or here in our country,\u201d\n\n4\n\nAthletic director Dazhon Darien allegedly used artificial intelligence to make\nit seem like the school\u2019s principal was spouting racist hate. Facebook/Dazhon\nLeslie Darien\n\nThe bizarre saga started in January, when disturbing audio of what sounded\nlike Pikesville High School Principal Eric Eiswert slamming students of color\nduring a phony conversation with one of the school\u2019s assistant principals made\nrounds on social media.\n\n## Explore More\n\n### George Soros is paying student radicals who are fueling nationwide\nexplosion of Israel-hating protests\n\n### Inside the failed White House coup to oust Biden press secretary Karine\nJean-Pierre\n\n### Horror as GWU protester carries sign with Nazi 'final solution' call for\nextermination of Jews\n\nIn the clip, the mimicked voice of Eiswert said African American students were\nunable to \u201ctest their way out of a paper bag\u201d and that there were two Jewish\nteachers who \u201cshould never have been hired at the school,\u201d according to\ncharging documents obtained by 2 WMAR.\n\nAs punishment, Eiswert was temporarily removed from the school \u2014 but he\ndeclared his innocence and told police he believed the audio clip was\nfalsified using AI.\n\nHe even pointed to Darien as the culprit, telling officials he was\n\u201ctechnologically savvy.\u201d\n\n4\n\nPrincipal Eric Eiswert denied that he made the comments, and even pointed the\nfinger at Darien as the culprit. X/@ericeiswert1\n\nEven more damning, there were conversations about not renewing Darien\u2019s\ncontract for the following semester following multiple work-related issues\nsince beginning his role as athletic director in July 2023, including firing a\nlong-standing coach at the school without approval and paying his roommate as\nan assistant coach despite not working for any teams.\n\n\u201cThrough their investigation, detectives alleged Mr. Darien who was the\nathletic director at the high school made the recording to retaliate against\nthe principal who had launched an investigation into the potential mishandling\nof school funds,\u201d Chief of Police Robert McCollough said.\n\nThe FBI and an expert from the University of California, Berkley ultimately\ntied Darien to the simulated audio to an email account under the alias TJ\nFoust, which he allegedly used to send the phony recording to his own work\nemail and other teachers at the school.\n\n4\n\nEiswert was temporarily removed from Pikesville High School as investigators\ncombed through the audio. TNS\n\nDuring an interview with detectives, Darien allegedly admitted to \u201chaving\nissues\u201d with Eiswert throughout his short tenure at the school.\n\nHe was arrested Friday at BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport when authorities were\nalerted to an improperly stored firearm in his bag, officials said.\n\nWhen they performed a background check, they discovered the warrant out for\nhis arrest that Baltimore County officials had filed the night before.\n\n4\n\nDarien was arrested Thursday while trying to board a flight to Texas.\nFacebook/Dazhon Leslie Darien\n\nWhether he was trying to flee to Texas or making an unrelated trip is still\nunknown, according to investigators.\n\nHe was charged with several charges including theft, stalking, disruption of\nschool operations and retaliation against a witness. He was released on a\n$5,000 unsecured bond.\n\nBaltimore County Schools have since put forth a recommendation for his\nemployment termination, and is expected to bring back Principal Eiswert now\nthat his name has been cleared.\n\n### Share this article:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Email\n  * Copy\n\nFiled under\n\n  * artificial intelligence\n  * baltimore\n  * crime\n  * maryland\n  * 4/25/24\n\nRead Next Teen steals woman\u2019s purse, punches her outside pharmacy:...\n\n#### Trending Now in US News\n\n  * This story has been shared 51,700 times. 51,700\n\n### George Soros is paying student radicals who are fueling nationwide\nexplosion of Israel-hating protests\n\n  * This story has been shared 48,990 times. 48,990\n\n### Inside the failed White House coup to oust Biden press secretary Karine\nJean-Pierre\n\n  * This story has been shared 46,997 times. 46,997\n\n### Horror as GWU protester carries sign with Nazi 'final solution' call for\nextermination of Jews\n\n  * This story has been shared 41,572 times. 41,572\n\n### Potential Trump VP pick says they shot dead a 'less than worthless' dog,\n'disgusting' goat\n\n## Now on Page Six\n\n  * ### Sylvester Stallone writing memoir \u2018The Steps\u2019 inspired by \u2018Rocky\u2019s iconic run at Philadelphia art museum\n\n  * ### Kyle Richards\u2019 home must-haves include this under-$8 Amazon find: \u2018Makes me feel like Kris Jenner\u2019\n\n  * ### OJ Simpson\u2019s cause of death revealed\n\nSee All\n\n#### Video\n\n  * ### Francisco Alvarez could beat eight-week recovery timetable | The Injury Report\n\n## Now on Decider\n\n  * ### Ellen DeGeneres Says She \u201cHated\u201d The Way \u2018The Ellen DeGeneres Show\u2019 Ended: \u201cIt Was Devastating\u201d\n\n  * \u2018Golden Bachelor\u2019 Gerry Turner\u2019s Daughter Weighs In On Golden Divorce, Says Their Family Has Been Facing \u201cRage And Cruelty\u201d From Fans\n  * \u2018AHS: Delicate\u2019 Finale Leaves Fans Enraged: \u201cNone of This Makes Sense\u201d\n  * Holly Madison Calls Bob Guccione A \u201cHorrible Person\u201d For Publishing Explicit \u2018Caligula\u2019 Content in Penthouse\n\nSee All\n\n## Covers\n\n### Today's Cover\n\n#### Front Cover Back Cover\n\n#### Flip for back cover\n\n### Browse Covers\n\nAthletic director Dazhon Darien allegedly used artificial intelligence to make\nit seem like the school's principal was spouting racist hate.
