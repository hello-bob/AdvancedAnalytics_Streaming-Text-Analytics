Today\u2019s tremendous achievement is a\nculmination of those efforts, in partnership with many forest licensees and\nhard-working tree planters.\u201d\n\nLast year, 305 million seedlings were planted in B.C. forests. One of these\nseedlings was the 10-billionth planted since work began almost a century ago.\nIn honour of this milestone, Ralston planted a ceremonial tree in Surrey\u2019s\nGreen Timbers Urban Forest Park. The park, dubbed the \u201cbirthplace of\nreforestation,\u201d is home to the Province\u2019s first reforestation efforts in 1930.\n\nForest tenure holders have been legally required to undertake reforestation\nefforts since 1987. In 2024, 235 million of the 290 million seedlings expected\nto be planted will be done through forestry companies, with an additional five\nmillion planted by First Nations.\n\n\u201cTen billion seedlings planted is a remarkable achievement in making sure our\nforests are with us for generations to come,\u201d Ralston said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get\nlost in the number, but there\u2019s a very human story here, too. Planting 10\nbillion trees means 10 billion carefully wielded shovels by 20 billion hands\nacross almost 100 years. This is an accomplishment we can all be proud of, and\nit\u2019s an honour to play a small part in that number by planting this tree\ntoday.\u201d\n\nIn addition to legislated reforestation efforts, the Province will plant an\nadditional 50 million trees this year through several provincial and federal\nprograms. These initiatives focus reforestation efforts on areas that have\nbeen adversely affected by natural disturbances, such as mountain pine beetle\ninfestations and wildfire.\n\n\u201cThe planting of 10 billion trees in our province is one of B.C.\u2019s most\nimportant mega projects,\u201d said John Betts, executive director, Western\nForestry Contractors\u2019 Association. \u201cBesides the hard work involved, it\u2019s an\nact of optimism where the full benefits won\u2019t be realized until well into the\nfuture. It\u2019s a fine legacy for all the thousands of nursery workers, planters\nand foresters involved over the years.\u201d\n\nIncluded in the 10 billion is a milestone from the Ministry of Forests\u2019 BC\nTimber Sales (BCTS), which is marking its one-billionth tree planted since the\norganization was founded in 2003. BCTS issues approximately 40 tree-planting\ncontracts to local and small business operators throughout the province every\nseason. By partnering with other Ministry of Forests branches, as well as\nindustry and the planting contract community, it contributes to the successful\nplanting of millions of seedlings each year.\n\nThe Province\u2019s research and investment programs continue to work improving\nsilviculture practices to boost the success of every seedling and help make\nsure B.C.\u2019s forests are resilient in a changing climate. Climate resiliency is\none reason why the Province provided the Bulkley Valley Centre for Natural\nResources Research and Management \u2013 a world-class research institute based in\nSmithers \u2013 with $10 million in 2023. Its new Silviculture Innovation Program\nwill support research and innovative practices that better address forest and\necosystem health.\n\nQuick Facts:\n\n  * The provincial Forest Investment Program has yearly targets to plant 40 million to 50 million seedlings.\n  * The program aims to reduce or sequester greenhouse gas emissions by the equivalent of two million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year through forest investment activities, such as planting and fertilization.\n  * BCTS is responsible for reforesting approximately 30,000 hectares (74,130 acres) of land annually, playing an active role in replenishing forests adversely affected by timber harvesting, fires, pests and natural disasters.\n  * BCTS has been working with tree nurseries on innovative ways to reduce waste, packaging seedlings without the use of single-use plastics.\n\nLearn More:\n\nB.C.\u2019s silviculture practices:\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-\nresources/silviculture\n\nBCTS \u2013 seedling services:\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/bc-timber-sales#Seedling\n\n### Media Contacts\n\n#### Ministry of Forests\n\nMedia Relations 250 896-7359\n\nhttps://news.gov.bc.ca/30701\n\n### Related Articles\n\n#### B.C. continues investments to support forest sector\n\nApril 12, 2024 1:30 PM\n\n#### Wildfire-damaged wood recovery underway in B.C.\n\nApril 10, 2024 8:38 AM\n\n#### Province, \u2018Namgis First Nation work on new sustainable forestry agreement\n\nApril 8, 2024 1:00 PM\n\n### Connect with the Ministry\n\n#### Photos\n\nView the Ministry's latest photos on Flickr.\n\n#### Videos\n\nWatch the Ministry's latest videos on YouTube.\n\n### Acknowledgment\n\nThe B.C.
