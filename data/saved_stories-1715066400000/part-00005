For example, after Seattle\nadopted a new zoning code removing regulatory barriers to accessory dwelling\nunits, ADU production doubled in year two, tripled in year three, and\nquadrupled the original baseline in years four and five. Yet Seattle\u2019s success\nwith ADU reform since 2019 may be outpaced by another city in Cascadia that\nhas just unleashed a surge of permits for relatively inexpensive infill\nhousing.\n\nIn the three-and-a-half months since its own new zoning code took effect on\nDecember 1, 2023, the City of Boise had 27 people per month apply for permits\nto build accessory dwelling units (ADUs) on their property\u2014also known as\nbackyard cottages, granny flats, or in-law apartments. That compares to a\npermit rate of just over 3 per month in the 12 months before the new code took\neffect. The rate of permit applications for ADUs under the new code is nearly\nnine times the rate of approvals in the year before the new code took effect.\n\nFor comparison\u2019s sake, Boise\u2019s 95 ADU permit applications since December put\nit on track to exceed Seattle\u2019s ADU production in 2019, even though Boise has\nbarely a third of Seattle\u2019s population.\n\nSome pent-up ADU projects may have waited for the new code to submit their\npermits, so it is still too early to estimate the full scale of the effects of\nthe zoning changes. A year or two of permit data will allow meaningful\ncomparisons in the actual construction of ADUs before and after the change in\nBoise\u2019s zoning code. But whatever the final magnitude of the increase, the\nrecent jump in permit applications shows that the new zoning code made\nproduction of these small infill homes much more attractive for homeowners.\n\nByron Folwell is a Boise architect whose practice includes providing owners\nfeasibility assessments for building ADUs on their lots. After meeting with\nover a hundred owners interested in adding them, Folwell believes three key\nchanges in the new code spurred the increase in permit applications.\n\n## The 3 changes that unlocked Boise\u2019s ADUs\n\n### 1\\. Removing bans on renters\n\nBoise\u2019s prior zoning code barred owners from renting out both the main house\nand the rental unit together. This rule prevented all existing landlords from\nadding a backyard cottage to an existing rental even though these owners had\nexperience renting and managing rental housing. The rule also created risk for\ncurrent owner-occupants who might need to leave their home for an extended\nperiod and need rental income to help cover the mortgage.\n\n### 2\\. Removing off-street parking requirements\n\nThe cottage behind the fence required discretionary approval from Boise\u2019s\nplanning director because of parking requirements. Under the new code, no\nspecial appeals on parking would be required for this project. Photo: Daniel\nMalarkey, used with permission.\n\nUnder the old code, a home had to have two off-street parking spaces, which\nmade ADUs infeasible on many of the city\u2019s smaller lots. Either there was no\nplace to put the two parking spots, or creating them would add costs that made\nthe project too expensive.\n\n* ##### Our work is made possible by the generosity of people like you!\n\nThanks to Rodney Brown & Catherine Conolly for supporting a sustainable\nCascadia.\n\n* Donate Today\n\nIn the picture above, one of Folwell\u2019s clients had to get a special decision\nfrom the city planning director to build an ADU. While the lot had two parking\nspaces, one space was in front of the garage and therefore didn\u2019t count under\nthe old rules. No special pleading would be required for this project under\nthe new code.\n\n### 3\\. Alignment among elected officials, planning and permitting staff, and\nmost Boise citizens on a shared vision for infill development\n\nThe new zoning code was the result of a multi-year public process followed\nimmediately by elections for the city council and mayor. The pro-housing\nforces won the day. With clear direction in the new code, planning staff are\nnow empowered to process permits efficiently and make timely approvals.\n\nBoise had made an initial step towards easing the barriers to ADUs in 2019 but\nmaintained parking and residency requirements that blocked many projects. This\nearlier, more timid effort to embrace granny flats helped prime the market. So\nwhen those barriers fell, a critical mass of owners, designers, and builders\nwas ready to submit permits.\n\n## Other \u201cmissing middle\u201d housing policies slower to uptake\n\nThe new zoning code also removed barriers to building plexes, multifamily, and\nmixed uses in neighborhoods\u2014for example, small service businesses that get\nfoot traffic can now operate legally out of their owner\u2019s house. Boise\u2019s\nplanning department now has a range of viable missing middle project\napplications that would have been barred under the prior code.\n\nHowever, the new flexibility has not yet changed the unit count and dollar\nvalue of new residential project permits in the first quarter of 2024. Unlike\nwith ADUs, there doesn\u2019t yet seem to be a noticeable trend toward these bigger\nprojects. Infill developers and their architects cite high construction costs,\nelevated interest rates, and unfamiliarity among builders and lenders with the\nnewly allowed housing types as reasons for taking measured steps towards\ndeveloping these options.\n\nWith time, more homes of all shapes and sizes will be built in Boise. In the\nmeantime, backyard cottages will stand in the vanguard.\n\n## Daniel Malarkey\n\n## Recommended Reading\n\n### Bellingham\u2019s Parking Reform Pilot Pays Off\n\nMay 1, 2024\n\n### Seattle Deserves a Better Comp Plan\n\nApril 18, 2024\n\n### Aging Solutions Are Climate Solutions\n\nApril 18, 2024\n\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Visit Sightline Daily for the day\u2019s top headlines for Cascadia each Monday,\nWednesday, and Friday, curated by the news editors of Sightline Institute.\n\nSee our picks here\n\n### It\u2019s (Past) Time for British Columbia to Legalize Roommates\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\n### Washington\u2019s 2024 Short-Session Housing Wins\n\nMarch 28, 2024\n\n* ###### For press inquiries and interview requests, please contact Serena Larkin\n\n###### Sightline Institute is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization and does not\nsupport, endorse, or oppose any candidate or political party.\n\nYou can power us forward on sustainable solutions.
