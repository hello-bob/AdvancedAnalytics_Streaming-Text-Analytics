But cliches are born from insight. In this case, it is about the power\nof the stories that we tell about ourselves, each other, and the world to\ncohere us in a common purpose.\n\nA lot of the things that we need to do today don\u2019t make sense if you are the\nonly one doing them. A story can order the world, so that we see our choices\nas part of a larger happening. Granted, the \u201clarger happening\u201d unfolding on\nEarth today is bigger than any story that we could make about it. Nonetheless,\nfor me a story that allows me to make meaning of my life, identify my allies,\nand understand what my role is, is essential.\n\nThe understanding of the power of narrative extends to all parts of the\npolitical spectrum. Everyone wants to control the narrative, a power for good\nor for ill. Adolph Hitler understood it well, riding a narrative of racial\nsuperiority and national glory that legitimized his ambitions and channeled\nlatent cultural energies toward genocide and conquest. Today we also have\npowerful unresolved energies in society, just like in the 1930s: discontent,\ndesperation, hostility to the elites, anger at the way society has turned,\ngrief over the loss of community. How these express depends in large part on\nhow problem and solution, cause and effect, are narrated to us.\n\nIf we want to serve peace and wellbeing for all people, a world of healing\nwhere society and all the beings on this planet are moving toward greater\nwholeness, we\u2019d better make sure that we\u2019re telling the right story. Today the\ndominant narrative, whether we recognize it or not, is a war narrative, not\nonly on the obvious level of US foreign policy, identifying enemies around the\nworld and bombing them, but also in our basic understanding of how the world\nworks and how to solve problems. War thinking permeates the public psyche. To\nbuild a peace narrative, we need to identify the existing foundational war\nnarrative. So, I will begin by excavating it and laying the foundation of a\npeace narrative. Then I\u2019ll move on to its building components and\narchitecture.\n\nThe Myth of Redemptive Violence\n\nIn preparing for this lecture, I read a classic essay by the Christian\ntheologian Walter Wink called \u201cThe Myth of Redemptive Violence.\u201d Redemptive\nviolence is the idea that the way to make a better world is to destroy\nsomething, to kill something, to kill evil, to extirpate evil, to overcome the\nforces of evil and chaos with the forces of good and order. Wink traces it\nback to a Babylonian creation myth over 3000 years old. In the beginning, the\ngod Adsu and the goddess Tiamat were all by themselves in the universe. Since\nthat was boring, they decided to have kids, a whole bunch of them. It wasn\u2019t\nlong before they regretted it because the kids were making too much noise. And\nso they decided, of course, that they were going to kill all their children.\nRight? Problem solved. Well, the children got wind of this and decided that\nthey would kill their parents first. It wasn\u2019t too hard to finish off Adsu,\nbut Tiamat was a different story. None of them dared to face Tiamat until the\nyoungest of the children, Marduk, volunteered. He said, I will destroy Tiamat,\nour mother, on condition that all you brothers and sisters make me the supreme\nruler of the universe. (I\u2019ll leave it to your imagination to draw parallels to\nthe US after World War Two.) Marduk comes up with a plan. He blows poison gas\ninto the stomach of Tiamat and stabs her with a spear. She explodes; all her\nguts and blood spew out and, from her body parts, he constructs the world that\nwe live in today.\n\nThis creation myth recounts the misogynistic killing of the great mother, who\nwas identified with chaos and the wild. Ancient civilizations, associated good\nwith order. The king was the incarnation of good, conquering the beasts,\nkilling the lions, cutting down the forests, bringing civilization to the\nbarbarians, domesticating the wild. This process continues today, as we take\nthe pieces of a ruined Gaia and build civilization out of them, building the\nworld out of the destroyed mother.\n\nThe myth of redemptive violence translates in a striking way into modern\nscience, which says that the tendency of the universe is toward entropy,\ntoward disorder. Only by imposing our design onto this chaotic, disorderly and\ndegenerating universe are we able to maintain a realm fit for human\nhabitation; to impose good upon chaos. If you accept that nature itself hasn\u2019t\nany inherent intelligence, any inherent tendency toward complexity, toward the\nemergence of beauty and organization, but instead that it normally degenerates\ninto disorder, then we are inescapably at war with nature all the time,\nsubject at any moment to being extinguished by random natural forces. Our\nwellbeing in that view comes through imposing more and more control on this\nwild, arbitrary, random nature that is outside of ourselves. For centuries,\nthe ambition toward control has defined progress.\n\nHere is the basic template of war thinking. First identify the cause of the\nproblem, the culprit, the perpetrator \u2013 find something to fight. Then,\ncontrol, imprison, exclude, kill, humiliate, or destroy the bad guy, the\nculprit, the cause, and all will be well. And the better able we are to do\nthis, the better human life is going to be. Walter Wink gives the example of\nPopeye the Sailor. Every episode of the cartoon has the same plot: Brutus\nkidnaps Olive Oyl. Popeye tries to rescue her and is beaten to a pulp by\nBrutus. Then, just before Brutus can rape Olive Oyl, Popeye eats a can of\nspinach and, with a surge of strength, turns the tables on Brutus and beats\nhim to a pulp instead. That\u2019s the plot of Popeye. Walter Wink points out that\nnobody ever learns anything from this encounter. The characters do not grow or\ndevelop in any way, implying that this is just the way things are. The lesson\nis that the way to solve a problem is to overcome the enemy with force.\n\nThe War on the Symptom\n\nThe mentality of finding an enemy to overcome with force extends beyond\nwarfare. Take agriculture, for instance. You have a problem, like declining\ncrop yields, you identify the cause \u2013 there are weeds in the field. And the\nsolution is to kill the weeds . Or maybe you have strep throat. What\u2019s the\ncause? Let\u2019s find the pathogen. That\u2019s the orientation. Find the pathogen. Ah,\nstreptococcus bacteria. Solution? Kill it with antibiotics. Or how about\ncrime? Well obviously crime is caused by criminals, right? So if we lock up\nthe criminals, then we won\u2019t have any more crime. Terrorism, obviously it\u2019s\ncaused by terrorists. So let\u2019s kill the terrorists. No more terrorism. Problem\nsolved.\n\nWhat if you want to be a better person or more effective in the world?\nApplying the same formula, you find the inner bad guy. Maybe it is your\nprocrastination, your laziness, your addictions, your selfishness, your ego.\nGreat \u2013 now you\u2019ve got something to attack, something to control. Maybe you\u2019re\noverweight and you think, \u201cOh, it\u2019s because I\u2019m eating too much.\u201d Calories\nbecome the bad guy, and the solution is to control them. So this war thinking\nis nearly universal.\n\nThe war on the other always mirrors a war on the self. Underneath our\njudgments lurks a sneaking suspicion that maybe I\u2019m one of the bad guys. In\nfact, this is more or less what science, economics, and many religions have\nbeen telling us. For example, an explicit teaching of biology has been that\nreproductive self interest is the fundamental motivation of all living beings.\nSelfishness, we were told, is programmed into our genes. That means that in\norder to be anything other than ruthlessly selfish, you have to overcome\nnature. That\u2019s war mentality.\n\nAn alternative to war emerges when we see all the enemies \u2013 weeds, criminals,\nterrorists, calories, selfishness, laziness and so forth \u2013 not as causes of\nevil, but as symptoms of a deeper condition. Focusing on the symptoms, warring\non the symptoms, allows the deeper causes to go unexamined and unchanged. We\nnever ask, \u201cWhy does Brutus want to kidnap Olive Oyl?\u201d If we don\u2019t unearth\nthat, we will be fighting Brutus again and again forever.\n\n(And what if the spinach runs out or stops working? What if the weeds develop\nherbicide resistance and the bacteria develop antibiotic resistance and Brutus\neats spinach too and starts an arms race?)\n\nWar thinking addresses its failure by going to further extremes. Don\u2019t just\nbeat up Brutus \u2013 kill him. Find an herbicide so powerful it kills the weeds\nonce and for all. Find the Final Solution. Defeat evil once and for all in an\nepic war to end all wars.\n\nWe tried that once. It was called the Great War. Now we call it World War One.\n\nWhen we see causes as symptoms, we can ask questions like, Why are weeds\ngrowing in the field? War thinking is not usually helpful with this question.\nPerhaps there\u2019s a lack of biodiversity in the field or the soil is depleted in\nsome way and those weeds are coming actually to repair the soil because\nthere\u2019s an intelligence in nature. There is nothing to fight.\n\nWhy is there crime? Is it because those criminals are just bad? Or are they\nacting from circumstances that we won\u2019t ever examine if we are at war with\nthem? What are the economic circumstances? How about legacy racism? What about\ntrauma, despair, or the loss of meaning in life?\n\nIn all cases, war thinking is a simplifying and reducing narrative. To wage\nwar, you pretty much have to reduce the enemy. You have to dehumanize the\nenemy. It\u2019s a universal tactic in war to make them \u2013 them \u2013 less than fully\nhuman. If you want to kill or exploit somebody, dehumanization is a key\nenabling method. As war thinking infiltrates our political culture, I\u2019m seeing\nmore and more dehumanization and demonizing of the other side, left and right,\nred and blue, Democrat and Republican. Each side constructs narratives that\nmake the other contemptible, evil, subhuman.\n\nHere are some words that are agents of dehumanization that you see all the\ntime in political discourse and beyond: \u201cHow could they?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s totally\nunjustified!\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with them?\u201d A war tactic is to accuse our\nopponents of some deficiency in their core humanness. They\u2019re stupid, they\u2019re\nignorant, they\u2019re immoral, they\u2019re entitled, they\u2019re greedy. And then this\nnarrative gets weaponized because we can then use it to arouse the indignation\nof our side, to stir up war fever so that we can rise up and destroy those bad\nguys.\n\nA Recipe for Despair\n\nI was recently on a podcast speaking about the more beautiful world our hearts\nknow is possible, speaking about ecological healing, regenerative agriculture\nand things like that, and the interviewer said, \u201cWell Charles, what would you\nsay to this? The power elite are never going to change. They\u2019re benefiting\nfrom this. They\u2019re happy with this and they\u2019re not going to change. So in\norder to change them, we\u2019re going to have to somehow bring them down. We\u2019re\ngoing to have to rise up in bloody revolution; that\u2019s the only realistic way.\u201d\n\nSo let\u2019s first assume that that\u2019s true. If that\u2019s true, then our one hope lies\nin overcoming them by force because \u201cthey\u2019re never going to change.\u201d We have a\nformula for creating change when there\u2019s a bad guy. It\u2019s in all the movies,\nnot just Popeye, it\u2019s in Batman, it\u2019s in the Lion King. It\u2019s in pretty much\nevery action movie you\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s in Star Wars. You kill Darth Vader,\nyou kill the emperor, you destroy evil.\n\nIn the real world, our one hope is impractical. If it comes to a contest of\nforce, who has more force? Who has more military power? Is it we hippies and\npeaceniks? Or is it the military-pharmaceutical-medical-financial-educational-\nNGO-prison-industrial complex? They have the guns. They have the money, they\nhave the surveillance state, they have the police, they have the control of\nthe media. So if, if it comes down to a contest of force, they\u2019re going to\nwin. Even if we talk about the force of propaganda and the force of a\nnarrative and we try to ignite the rage and indignation of the oppressed\nagainst them, guess what? They are even more adept at manipulating narratives\nand making you look bad because they control the media. They\u2019re doing it right\nnow, creating narratives that are more ubiquitous and have a farther reach and\nmore PR and advertising behind them, more money behind them than yours do.\n\nSo, domination is probably a recipe for failure unless you become so good at\nthe technologies of war that you do tear them down. You have to be extremely\ngood at wielding power to defeat the military-industrial complex at its own\ngame. So you defeat the bad guys and now you\u2019re in power. But is the fight\nover now? No. They are still bad guys out there. And in order to defeat those\nbad guys, you need to consolidate your power and extend your power, all of\ncourse to protect the world from evil. It\u2019s OK to do that, because you are the\ngood guy. You know it to be true. The whole war against evil was premised on\nit. So, identifying as good, you pursue yet more power. George Orwell\ndescribed this very, very clearly in 1984: the goal of the Party is power. The\njustification is that they\u2019re going to create a perfect world, and in order to\ndo that, they have to have complete power. What is power? Power is the ability\nto make others suffer. So you end up becoming evil yourself.\n\nThe more likely scenario is that you lose the fight with the powers-that-be.\nAnd that\u2019s why so many activists fall into despair. Despair is built into the\nparadigm of the fight. On one level it is because we know the powers are too\ngreat for us to win. Underneath that there is a kind of futility: if we do win\nit\u2019s the same. The science fiction writer Phillip K. Dick put it really well\nin Valis: \u201cTo fight the empire is to be infected with its derangement. This is\na paradox. Whoever defeats a segment of the empire becomes the empire. It\nproliferates like a virus, imposing its form on its enemies. Thereby, it\nbecomes its enemies.\u201d If you go to war against war, if you go to war against\nthe empire, you have actually become part of the empire. And George Orwell\nillustrated this too, when the main character, Winston, gets recruited into\nthe resistance. Actually he\u2019s being entrapped, but he thinks he\u2019s being\nrecruited into the resistance. And he\u2019s asked, basically, how committed he is\nto overthrowing the Party, questions like, \u201cWould you be willing to do\nanything? Would you be willing to commit sabotage? Would you be willing to\ncommit mass murder if it served the overthrow of the Party? Would you be\nwilling to throw acid in a child\u2019s face?\u201d And he says yes, therefore revealing\nhimself to be no different from the Party: do anything to gain power. Do\nanything to overthrow evil.\n\nThe Threat of the Pacifist\n\nConsider the following as a general principle: in any fight \u2013 and more and\nmore of our political discourse has become a fight \u2013 the resolution lies in\nthe things that are hidden by the fight, the things that both sides agree on\nwithout even knowing it and the questions that neither side is asking. So for\nexample in the fight over immigration, one side says, \u201cImmigration is harming\nus, they are breaking our laws, let\u2019s keep them out.\u201d The other side says,\n\u201cYou horrible bigoted, intolerant people, this nation was built from\nimmigrants. It is inhumane to run detention systems and separate families. We\nshould welcome the unfortunate masses from the world.\u201d Nobody, at least in the\nmainstream media, is asking why are there so many immigrants to begin with.\nWhat has made life in Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and so\nforth, so unbearable that people are willing to risk their lives and their\nchildren\u2019s lives, willing to leave their homes and families. for a totally\nuncertain future? What would it take for you to do that?\n\nThat\u2019s an uncomfortable question, first because it takes us outside of the\nfamiliar war paradigm of problem-solving. For the conservatives, you can no\nlonger blame bad immigrants. For the liberals, you can no longer hold to the\nstory of unfortunate victims of someone else, that can find salvation in\nAmerica, Land of the Free, because any serious inquiry into that question\nreveals that we ourselves, the United States, is the cause of much of the\nmisery in Latin America and elsewhere. US support for military coups, juntas,\ndeath squads, the war on drugs, and neoliberal austerity and free trade\npolicies have made life in many places nearly unliveable.\n\nAs the saying goes, when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a\nnail. You look for nails and you start to see things that aren\u2019t nails as\nnails, because here\u2019s your tool. When you have the tools of war, you look for\nan enemy. If none is to be found we are uncomfortable, because we don\u2019t know\nwhat to do anymore. All the more so when, as with immigration, the\nperpetrator, the cause of the problem, includes oneself.\n\nIf you are a pacifist or a peacemaker, you may find that you arouse a lot of\nhostility from both sides of a conflict. People who gain their identity from\nbeing on Team good in the war against Team Evil, actually need Team Evil. They\nneed the other side. It\u2019s like two cards leaning against each other and\npropping each other up. When \u201cevil\u201d is taken away, there is a crisis, a kind\nof political vertigo, and a desperate rush to find a new bad guy. Hence the\nflailing attempts after the defeat of the Soviet Union to reconstitute evil in\nconcepts like the \u201cAxis of Evil,\u201d \u201cIslamic terror,\u201d the \u201cclash of\ncivilizations,\u201d and more by demonizing Iran, Russia, and China. Team Good\nneeds Team Evil to validate its identity. The pacifist, by challenging the\nidentity of both sides, arouses more hostility than the enemy does. Pacifists\nare more despised than the enemy.\n\nFoundations of a Peace Narrative\n\nAs the abovementioned examples demonstrate, war thinking pervades modern\ncivilization. It goes all the way down to cosmology, to physics, and in\nbiology to the idea of the selfish gene, setting up a view of nature as, in\nthe words of Rudolf Steiner, a war of each against all. All of this, I would\nadd, is obsolete science. Now we are starting to understand, with research on\nemergence and self-organizing systems, which are ubiquitous in nature, that\nthe world actually has a tendency toward order, towards beauty, as if there\nwere an intelligence in all things, and not toward disorder as the Second Law\nof Thermodynamics seems to imply. The selfish gene, likewise, is obsolete\nbiology. Now we are appreciating symbiosis, cooperation, and the merger of\nindividuals into greater wholes in an ascent of complexity. That\u2019s how biology\nworks.\n\nThe emergence of systems thinking in biology is part of a peace narrative.\nNature is not one gigantic war of each against all. Cooperation and symbiosis\nare primary evolutionary principles.\n\nOk, so what is the foundation of a peace narrative? If, as I said before, the\nessence of war is reduction \u2013 the reduction of the universe to object, of life\nto thing, of other people to enemy \u2013 the simplification of complexity so that\nthere is a thing to fight \u2013 then, if we want to build a peace narrative, the\nfirst foundational pillar would be holistic thinking. Holistic thinking\nunderstands that everything is intimately related to everything else. That\neverything is a part of everything else. That to exist is to be in\nrelationship. That we are not separate individuals, but are interdependent\nboth practically and existentially. That we are inter-existent. Therefore,\nanything that we see as an enemy is part of a constellation of relationships\nthat includes ourselves. To use a Buddhist term, the foundation of a peace\nnarrative is interbeing: a connected self in a living, interdependent\nuniverse, in contrast to a separate individual in a world of other.\n\nFrom that foundational understanding, we seek to understand the constellation\nof relationship \u2013 the first pillar of a peace narrative. So if you are getting\nstrep throat a lot, you might seek to understand, \u201cHow is the bacteria part of\nmy body ecology?\u201d In fact, a healthy microbiome on the mucus membranes of the\nthroat includes friendly bacteria that secrete substances that suppress the\npathogenic bacteria. Killing the strep bacteria will end that particular\nepisode of illness, but it also kills off the friendly bacteria, leaving you\nmore susceptible. This exemplifies a general principle: war creates the\nconditions for war. When you bomb the terrorists, you create conditions for\nmore terror. When you lock up the criminals and destroy families and destroy\ncommunities, you\u2019re creating conditions that breed more crime.\n\nLooking through a holistic lens, the lens of interdependency and\ninterrelationship, the base conditions that breed all the things we war\nagainst become visible. And we no longer then default to fighting something.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s never a time to fight. It doesn\u2019t mean never to\nrun away from a robber or never to use antibiotics. Maybe you theoretically\nknow that this person is about to harm your child because he suffered\nchildhood trauma himself, but in this moment that doesn\u2019t help you, and the\nonly response you can see is to intervene forcefully. The problem comes when\nwe default to a fight first because we\u2019re so used to seeing the world in terms\nof good and evil. So a fight becomes the default, reflexive response.\n\nThe Pillar of Compassion\n\nWhen we can understand the conditions that generate the behavior that we are\nfighting against, then there are other options, specifically, the option of\nchanging those conditions. This leads to the second pillar, which I\u2019ll call\ncompassion. What is compassion? It\u2019s not the superior person indulgently,\npatronizingly tolerating or sympathizing with the condition of the inferior\nperson. Compassion is basically feeling what it\u2019s like to be somebody else. It\nis the experience of identifying with somebody else and knowing what it\u2019s like\nto be them. It comes from the question, what is it like to be you? What are\nthe conditions that have made you into who you are? And how can I participate\nin the evolution of those conditions?\n\nFor most people growing up in this society, to see those conditions requires\nsome deprogramming: deprogramming from condemnation, from, \u201cwhich side are you\non?\u201d From judgment, judgment in the sense of, \u201cIf I were you, I wouldn\u2019t have\ndone that. I\u2019m better than you.\u201d Or maybe I\u2019m worse than you. Usually it\u2019s I\u2019m\nbetter than you.\n\nI once made these points to a colleague, using the example of how inner-city\nyouth are demonized as \u201cthugs\u201d in total ignorance of their social and economic\nconditions. She heartily agreed that they couldn\u2019t really be morally blamed\nfor their behavior. But, she said, that doesn\u2019t hold for the white\nsupremacists. She said, \u201cI can understand why a black kid who grew up in the\nghetto might turn to crime when there\u2019s no other economic opportunities and\nhe\u2019s suffered intergenerational trauma. But those white supremacists have no\nexcuse. Look at those guys with their bellies hanging out over their belts, in\ntheir tee shirts and their hats. The very picture of entitlement. They\u2019ve got\nno excuse to be the way that they are.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re just waiting for someone to hate aren\u2019t we? Here\u2019s the enemy! Here\u2019s\nsomeone upon whom we can let loose with our righteous rage. It feels good,\ndoesn\u2019t it, to know you are on the side of good and right. It feels good to\nlet loose with the hate.\n\nThat feeling is a clue that a hidden psychological or emotional need is\noperating. Ultimately, it comes from the wound of self-rejection.\n\nA few years ago, there was a biker gang riot in Texas. Rival gangs converged\nat a bar and started beating each other up in the parking lot. The police\ncame, they started beating up the police too. It was a horrendous violent\nriot. I read about it in Salon magazine, which featured photographs of the men\ninvolved in this incident. Of course they chose the most contemptible\nunflattering pictures you could imagine. And the sub headline should have\nbeen: Here\u2019s someone you can hate. Here\u2019s the bad guy. Of course, every time\nthey run an article about Donald Trump or anyone else in the opposite camp,\nthey choose an unflattering photograph too. Both sides do that. It is part of\nthe war strategy of dehumanization. Me, I look at those photographs and think,\n\u201cOnce upon a time, every one of those men was a cute little baby. A sweetums.\nWhat happened to you, my brother?\u201d And I look deeply and sometimes I can see a\nhurt and frightened child, bewildered by the brutality of this world. That\nbegets a different kind of solidarity than that of war. We don\u2019t need a common\nenemy anymore to join together.\n\nCompassion is the opposite of the dehumanization upon which war narratives\ndepend. Dehumanization is a simplifying narrative, which is the opposite of\nholism or interbeing. The habit is, for example, when addressing racism to\nblame it on the individual attitudes of bad people \u2013 racists. Racism is caused\nby racists, right? Or could it be that racists are a symptom of racism, not\nthe cause, and that by dehumanizing them we reinforce the basic psychic\ntemplate of racism. Racism is dehumanization, and it will not be solved by\ndehumanizing the racists. Oh, it might feel good, you get to be on Team Good.\nBut is that what you want to serve? Or would you rather serve the healing of\nracism?\n\nSacrificing Winning\n\nI have a feeling that the healing of Earth, that we all want so much, is going\nto require a sacrifice. We are going to have to sacrifice the identity of\nbeing on the moral, ethical, right side. Nearly everyone imagines themselves\nto be. For things to change, an awful lot of letting go is necessary. But only\nfor the other side, right? Are you willing to hold as lightly to your\nrightness as you wish them to hold lightly to theirs? How are you any\ndifferent?\n\nThe third pillar of a peace narrative is to end the internal war and to\ndevelop a peace narrative inside of ourselves. It is to heal the wound of\nself-rejection, and thus to remove the psychic engine of war \u2013 the division of\nthe world into us and them, good and evil, me the good person and them the bad\nperson. The best, easiest way to establish your identity as a good person (and\nmeet the need for self-acceptance) is in contrast to the evil people. So, are\nyou willing to give that up? Are you willing to give up having been right all\nalong?\n\nHow much do you care about peace? It said that one cannot serve two masters.\nTemporarily, you can, you can serve peace and at the same time serve getting\nthe approval of an in-group. You can serve peace and at the same time serve\nyour identity as a good person. You can serve peace and at the same time serve\nyour goal of being heard, of being seen, being recognized, of being seen as a\nleader, of believing yourself to be moral. You can serve both for a while, but\neventually the generosity of the universe is such that you will reach a choice\npoint where you get to decide what you really serve, and you then need to make\na sacrifice. This can be a bitter pill to swallow.\n\nPlease understand that I am not making a moral exhortation to drop hatred and\nanger. I am not the privileged white guy imploring those he has oppressed not\nto be angry with him. The point here is not that anger or hatred are wrong. It\nis that the energy of anger is neutralized when it is diverted towards\nsymptoms rather than causes. It is that hatred is based on a misdiagnosis of\ncause. They lead either to revenge, defeat, or endless war.\n\nThe temptation to go to war is everywhere. Maybe you get upset about GMO seeds\nand Monsanto, which is now Bayer, vigorously spreading GMOs around the world.\nDestroying peasant agriculture, corrupting entire governments, instituting the\nnext iteration of industrial agriculture, patenting seeds and varieties that\nwere developed by indigenous cultures and so on. Okay, we\u2019ve got to stop this.\nHow are we going to do that? Well, in the mentality of war, step one is to\nidentify somebody as the bad guy. Easy \u2013 that\u2019s the Monsanto executives. Why\nare they doing that? How could they? If I were them, I wouldn\u2019t do that, would\nI? I wouldn\u2019t make those decisions. If I were a fracking executive, I wouldn\u2019t\ndestroy and pollute the waters like that. All for what? For my greed? I can\u2019t\nbelieve those people. Let\u2019s arouse some hatred. Let\u2019s tear those fuckers down.\nThat\u2019s the strategy.\n\nImagine that you are a Monsanto executive and hear everybody talking about how\ngreedy you are, how horrible you are, and you\u2019re thinking, \u201cI walk my\nneighbors dog when they\u2019re on vacation. I work really hard. My colleagues\nrespect me. I\u2019m advancing science to feed the hungry.\u201d Or maybe he\u2019s a\nfracking executive, and his story is about building America\u2019s energy\nindependence. In their story, they\u2019re the good guys and by demonizing them you\nseem ridiculous. You are in fact offering yourself as the bad guy by the way\nthat you see them and relate to them.\n\nWhat\u2019s the alternative? Earlier I described two possibilities either get\ndefeated by the military-industrial complex, or you overcome them and become\nthe new complex. What\u2019s the alternative?\n\nThe alternative comes from an entirely different place: interbeing. It starts\nby asking, Why? Why is he so greedy or why is she pro-fracking or why is he\nviolent or why are those people \u2013 you know who they are \u2013 pro-this or anti-\nthat? What story informs their belief system and what state of being co-\nresonates with that story? What is their experience of life? All we judge, we\nbegin to investigate as symptoms. We ask, for example, Where does greed come\nfrom? That question opens up insights, understanding, and new possibilities\nfor change. We may discover that it is another one of those symptoms, just\nlike strep. It\u2019s a symptom of an experience of scarcity. It\u2019s a hunger that\ncan never be met by the objects that are offered to feed it. If somebody is\ncut off from community, cut off from nature, cut off from meaning in their\nlives, they\u2019re going to be hungry for those things. But instead, what\u2019s\noffered is money, prestige, possessions, power. Those are the substitutes\nmodern society most conspicuously offers.\n\nA Story is an Invitation\n\nIf you can look at the person that you call an enemy and see in them that\nactually, on a deep level, they want what you want and what all people want \u2013\nto contribute their gifts to a more beautiful world, to be generous, to\nbelong, to know and to be known, love and be loved, and to serve a purpose\nbeyond themselves \u2013 if you can see that, you\u2019ll be able to speak to that, and\nyou\u2019ll be able to create an invitation to that.\n\nOne of my mottos is that the story that we hold about a person is an\ninvitation for them to step into that story. Consider the story of Julio Diaz.\nThis guy in New York, maybe he was Puerto Rican origin, can\u2019t remember, but he\ntakes the subway home every day and gets off a stop early to buy a burrito at\nhis favorite burrito store before walking home. Well one day he gets off, and\non his way to the restaurant a mugger holds him up at knifepoint. \u201cGive me\nyour wallet!\u201d Okay. He gives him his wallet and then says, \u201cHey kid, it\u2019s cold\nout. Do you want my jacket too?\u201d And the mugger \u2013 what\u2019s he going to say?\nNonplussed, he says, \u201cSure, OK.\u201d Julio gives him his jacket, then says, \u201cHey,\nI was about to go get a burrito. It\u2019s a really good burrito joint. You want to\ncome with me?\u201d What can he say? He comes with him. And then they\u2019re at the\ncounter ordering their burritos and Julio says, \u201cYou know, I would treat you\nto the burrito but you\u2019ve got my wallet. Can I have my wallet back?\u201d He gives\nhim his wallet. Then Julio says, \u201cNow give me the knife, too.\u201d The mugger\ngives him his knife.\n\nThat would not have been possible if Julio had seen that teenager as a bad\nguy. But he was able, even with a knife in his face, he was able to see\nsomething else. He held the teenage mugger in a story of, who knows, \u201cA\ntroubled young man with a good heart\u201d so strongly that the mugger was helpless\nto resist. That is the power of the stories that we hold about each other.\nThey can generate miracles. Now I\u2019m not offering that as a formula. If someone\nholds you up at knifepoint, you can\u2019t imitate the words or tactics of Julio\nunless you actually see something in your assailant, in your enemy, that you\ncan speak to from a different story. It can\u2019t be just a spiritual ideology,\nyou have to actually see it. Conditioned to dehumanized versions of enemies,\nwhether muggers or corporate executives, we might have trouble seeing\nsomething else, but we can learn with practice. The practice is in looking for\nit. To see it you have to look for it. To look for it, you have to be willing\nto put down the benefits you get from holding others as enemies or as lesser\nthan, less moral, worthy, beautiful, or conscious than you. Less enlightened\nthan you. Less spiritual than you. Less ethical than you. You have to be\nwilling to put those judgements down, because as long as you hold them, you\ninvite the enemy to be those judgments.\n\nJudgements are a cloud, a distorting cloud that reduces people to the image of\nthe judgements and allows little opportunity or invitation for them to be\nanything else. So you have to be willing to put them down. How do you do that?\nIs that a fight against yourself? Is that an effort of will? No. Putting them\ndown comes from understanding where those judgments come from. Why do we have\nsuch a need to establish ourselves as the good guys? It comes, as I\u2019ve said,\nfrom a wound of self-rejection. The wound of self-rejection is also a product\nof war thinking, that says something is wrong with you, and virtue comes\nthrough some kind of self-conquest. It\u2019s built into school, it\u2019s built into\nparenting, it\u2019s built into religion. It\u2019s ubiquitous in our culture. If you\u2019re\na parent, anytime you look at your child with contempt or disgust and say,\n\u201cWhy did you do that? How could you?\u201d You\u2019re basically conveying, \u201cyou\u2019re\nbad.\u201d It\u2019s not just in the words,it is the energy behind them. \u201cWhy did you do\nthat?\u201d is rarely an honest question. Usually it is a coded condemnation. If\nyou made it an honest question, then you\u2019d be getting somewhere. Why did you\ndo that? Please help me to understand, because I know who you are, divine\nbeing. Help me to understand, Monsanto executive. Help me to understand,\nDonald Trump. Maybe you don\u2019t ask that person specifically, but that\u2019s the\norientation. That\u2019s a way to look for what Julio Diaz was able to see, so that\nyou can invite it into expression.\n\nPeace Words and Solidarity Stories\n\nSo those are some of the foundations and pillars of a peace narrative. The\nbuilding blocks, the construction components are the stories that foster\nunderstanding. They could be stories that help people understand what it is\nlike to be an immigrant, what it is like to be a racist, what it is like to be\na corporate executive, or what is like to live in a ghetto. So many of our\npolitical stances would be untenable if we really knew what it was like to be\nsomebody else.\n\nThese stories need to be presented in a way that they can be heard. They are\nharder to hear if I present them with a secret agenda of making you feel\nashamed and humiliated. The purpose is not to bludgeon their conscience with\nhow much harm they\u2019ve caused. That\u2019s another form of warfare. Instead, I can\npresent the story and trust you to make the connections. When that happens,\nauthentic shame might arise, as opposed to coerced shame. Authentic shame is\nthe breakdown of a self image. It dissolves and the chemical bonds, the\npsychic chemical bonds that held it together; they release heat and your face\nflushes. Energy that had been bound up in defending and upholding a self-image\nis liberated, and you feel a lightness and a new clarity of vision. To go\nthrough that process fully, it really helps to know that you\u2019re loved. It is\nvery vulnerable, and no one is likely to go all the way through it unless they\nfeel safe. Instead they may retreat into defensiveness.\n\nThat\u2019s why these stories \u2013the building blocks of a peace narrative, the\nbuilding blocks of solidarity that doesn\u2019t require an enemy \u2013 are so much more\npowerful when they\u2019re presented and held in a way where people feel safe to\nhear them. They have to sense that you\u2019re not trying to attack them, and you\ntrust them, you trust their basic goodness. You trust. You take the stance of,\n\u201cI know it\u2019s hard for you to go through this humiliation. I\u2019m here for you, my\nbrother, my sister. I\u2019m here for you. We\u2019re in this together.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a peace narrative. We are in this together.\n\nAnother component of building a peace narrative is our words and how we use\nthem. A lot of the English language subtly or not so subtly suggests and\nfacilitates dehumanization and war thinking. Take for example the word\n\u201cinexcusable.\u201d What is actually meant by inexcusable? Something like: Some bad\nactions have an excuse, they\u2019re justified. (Justifiable is another such word.)\nAnd some actions just have no excuse. And if they have no excuse, you only did\nthat because you\u2019re a bad person. Words like that insinuate war ideology into\nour language. That\u2019s true even if you\u2019re hurling those epithets of greedy,\ninexcusable, unjustifiable, evil, or immoral at the warmongers. In so doing,\nyou become one of them.\n\nThe point here is not to set ourselves up as the language police. Changing the\nwords we use is not enough. As anyone knows who has studied Nonviolent\nCommunication, the NVC formula can be used very violently. It depends on the\nintention behind it. I\u2019m not an agent of the PC word police, extending its\npatrol to any word that might humiliate or dehumanize somebody. The reason I\nbring attention to these words is to illuminate the perceptions and\nassumptions built into them. Our use of these words can alert to how we carry\nwar thinking within ourselves.\n\nThen, rather than go to war against our own war thinking, we can look beneath\nthat symptom and address the wounds. These are wounds of self rejection,\nalienation, and cutoff from community and nature and intimate participation in\nthe material world. These have happened through trauma of all kinds, some\nobvious, some normalized in modern society and hence invisible. When we begin\nto heal those and no longer see through the lens of good guys versus bad guys,\nus versus them, good and evil, right and wrong, then it no longer feels good\nto use those words. They feel like lies. They feel inconsistent with who I am\nand who I want to become.\n\nSo those are some of the building blocks to place atop the foundation and\npillars of a peace narrative. They embody peace in our words and in stories\nthat foster understanding, that induce people to ask or to wonder or to\nconsider, \u201cWhat is it like to be you?\u201d What are the conditions that generate\nthe things that are hurting the world so much? That are so painful to witness?\nWar thinking actually maintains those conditions. It maintains the status quo\nby diverting the grief, pain, and rage that injustice inspires onto a proxy\ncalled the enemy. Here\u2019s something that hurts. Police violence, incarceration,\necocide, the draining of a wetland, whatever it is, here\u2019s something that\nhurts. War thinking takes that energy that could go to healing and diverts it\nonto a scapegoat, so that we fight the symptoms forever, ignoring and even\naggravating the cause. Let\u2019s not take that bait. Let\u2019s get serious about world\nhealing.\n\nA More Beautiful World\n\nBeyond the foundation, pillars, and building blocks of a peace narrative, we\nmight also speak of its structure, its architecture. I call it a story-of-the-\nworld, the \u201cmore beautiful world our hearts know is possible,\u201d that we invite\npeople into. It\u2019s a world where everybody has a place, where everybody is\nvalued, where everybody is welcome, where everybody is known to have a gift\nthat is essential to make that world even richer. And nobody is left out. As\nwith Julio Diaz, to speak compellingly of that world, you have to have seen\nit. The story we hold about the world is an invitation for the world to enter\nthat story too. We have to have seen it. And I would say probably everybody in\nthis room has seen it. You have had a glimpse of what the world could be, that\nthe world could be peaceful. You\u2019ve seen that this isn\u2019t really working for\nthe power elite either, it\u2019s not working for the perpetrators, the military\ncommanders, the politicians, the executives. You might see that there\u2019s a part\nof them that is willing to make the courageous choice to let go of something\nthat was precious to them, something they\u2019re starting to realize it\u2019s not so\nprecious after all.\n\nHere we all are, having caught a glimpse or many glimpses in our lives of a\nworld that we know is possible. And if you\u2019re like me, we don\u2019t know how to\nget there. The mind says it\u2019s not possible because, What\u2019s the plan? The mind\nis immersed in \u2013 I\u2019ve been calling it war thinking, but it\u2019s deeper than war\nthinking \u2013 forced-based causality. How are you going to make it happen? That\u2019s\na more subtle variation on war thinking. How are you going to make it happen?\nHow are you going to exert a force on a mass? That\u2019s Newtonian physics,\nanother part of the old story of separation. Well, we don\u2019t know how it will\nhappen. We don\u2019t have enough force and information to make it happen. If it\nisn\u2019t entirely up to our own force, we\u2019re going to have to trust something\nelse. We\u2019re going to have to trust that there is an intelligence in the world\ngreater than ourselves, that there is an organic tendency or will toward\norganization and beauty and complexity that is unfathomably mysterious.\nTherefore, we don\u2019t have to know how it\u2019s going to happen, nor do we have to\nfight the world to make it happen.\n\nInstead, we start by listening. What is my part? How shall I be deployed?\nWhere am I to be and what is mine to do? What calls to my care? And from that\nplace, maybe we become able to speak that world story, to speak that\ninvitation, or maybe we just carry it in ourselves and act from our deep-\nseated knowledge of it. In these gatherings we remind each other that the\nknowledge that a more beautiful world is possible is real knowledge \u2013 because\nyou wouldn\u2019t be here if you hadn\u2019t seen it too. The very fact of this\ngathering stirs my optimism. It reminds me, I\u2019m not crazy. You wouldn\u2019t be\nhere otherwise or have stayed to listen to all these words. Even if you have\ncome with loads of skepticism and despair, you\u2019re here. You still have hope.\nLife never dies. Living things die, but life itself always strives for more\nlife. Thank you for carrying that bit, that glimpse of a more beautiful world\nwith you, so that we can weave a peace narrative around it. Yes. Thank you so\nmuch.\n\nVideo of this lecture: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj9aI1d8miE\n\nPrevious: Xylella: Supervillain or Symptom\n\nNext: The Amazon: How do we heal a burning heart?\n\nFiled Under: Political & Social Tagged With: cultural narrative, Essay,\nHome-V1, interbeing, new story, old story, transition\n\n## Reader Interactions\n\n### Comments\n\n  1.

Nancy says\n\nAugust 22, 2019 at 5:17 pm\n\nI am weeping in tenderness and gratitude and while I have long held on to\nbeing a good girl in contrast to what felt perverse in my family I have also\nlong had compassion for each of them though I do not feel at all safe with\nthem.\n\nLet me say one simple thing. LOVE in my experience and feeling held are so\ndarn important...I know that last year when I had an affair and maybe felt\nlove, admiration and joy for the first time in my life, my body healed even\ntho I later got hurt. I would not have missed that sacrifice/cost of feeling\nLOVE.\n\nSo much more I could say here. I like text and the ability to trace words with\nmy body in contact with a page even if on a computer. I think in this moment\nfor some odd reason of Thich Nhat Hanh\u2019s poem, Call me by My True Name....and\nI have long used the motto Together We Heal. Much appreciation, Charles.\n\n  7. Erica Etelson says\n\nAugust 23, 2019 at 12:14 am\n\nFor activists trying to make change in a dysfunctional \u201cdemocracy,\u201d we\nsometimes resort to direct action and civil disobedience \u2014 of course, we see\nourselves on the side of justice and, therefore, our tactics are righteous,\nthe end justifies the means, even if the means involves force. Direct action\nis non-violent but it is an application of force in the sense that \u2014 the\nsystem isn\u2019t working so we need to disrupt it and force the powers that be to\nlisten to us and yield to our demands, even if those demands aren\u2019t\nuniversally shared by all Americans/human beings. I\u2019m all for what Charles is\ntalking about as far as eschewing hatred and contempt and self-righteous\nsuperiority and trying to see the other person\u2019s humanity, complexity and\ndecency. At the same time, given the urgency of so many existential problems\nconfronting our country and world, and given how badly divided we are with\nstrong unwillingness to hear what the other side is saying, would Charles say\nthat taking direct action in the service of what our side believes is\n\u201cjustice\u201d is part of the problematic war model or is justified and necessary?\n\n     * Dwain Wilder says\n\nSeptember 18, 2019 at 3:49 pm\n\nA great question, Erica! At its best, non-violent direct action does not\ninitiate or call for a use of disruption. What it aims to do is to make\nmanifest the disruption that exists but is tolerated by the governed and the\npeople as well. That in itself is a witnessing of reality, a physical\nexplication of it.\n\nThere are blockades that I have participated in that do not stop there. In a\nblockade, one physically, with an unmovable presence, interrupts an injustice.\nI was part of Staughton Lynd\u2019s Peoples Congress of 1965, in which we\nphysically blocked the entrance to the congressional building, as best we\ncould, to demonstrate that the people would not tolerate being represented in\nfighting this war. We submitted without struggle to arrest. I\u2019ve been part of\nother blockades also, on similar grounds.\n\nIt seems to me that private citizens who put their bodies at risk to interrupt\nthe injust operations of the law or the government \u2013 or in the present case of\nthe world\u2019s governments\u2019 refusal to acti decisively on the climate crisis \u2013 is\nto interrupt violence with peace. As long as one is willing to accept the\nconsequences of one\u2019s action with no physical forcing, I maintain that is\nconfronting injustice and the violence perpetrated by governments and\nindustries bent on maintaining their ability to continue making money\nregardless of the unjust consequences of their rapacity.\n\nI do agree that we should stay away from war-like framing of our actions.\nStruggling with one another is a very human thing to do. Making war or\nentering into battle always comes out of the three poisons humanity is liable\nto: greed, hatred and delusion. Sometimes a threat is so dire that a society\nunderstandably cannot rise above it to a higher consciousness, and therefore\nmust be forced into some really evil karma. The attack on Pearl Harbor comes\nto mind. But along with accepting that karma comes much dire evil done in\nresponse. The internment camps of the Japanese shortly after Pearl Harbor\ncomes to mind, of course, as do many other episodes of WW II, such as the\natomic bombing of Japan, and the fire-bombing of German cities. Could we have\nbeen wiser? Many wise people were like voices crying in the wilderness \u2013 some\nof them conscientious objectors such as the Seventh Day Adventists. Many of\nthese were imprisoned, forced to serve non-combatant roles in the military, or\nvolunteered for forest fire-fighting, etc.\n\nLife is complex, and clarity hard-won at best.\n\n  8. Sandra Taylor says\n\nAugust 23, 2019 at 6:51 am\n\nterrific essay charles \u2013 I have been on team good for a long time and through\nmeeting you and other synchronistic happenings I have been practicing letting\ngo of the us and them , learning inclusion , feeling for the other, embracing\nwhere possible and observing. this year I challenged myself with a\ndysfunctional committee \u2013 still set in the war story committed to making\nenemies and unnecessary difficulties. I used love, tolerance , clear\ncommunication , refused to take it personally at least overtly -there was an\ninner struggle . I wont say it is all peaches and cream, I did note the main\ntrouble maker found it difficult to get a purchase on my \u2018refusal to fight and\nmy passion to come up with creative inclusive ideas and has had to leave. I am\ninterested to see where and how it unfolds from here . It is a challenge to\nremove our Selves from the dominant story , to really look deeply into it and\nthen reshape our world accordingly. You have a great gift of synthesising and\nbringing us along into the unfolding story. many thanks and blessings to you\nand yours.\n\n  9. Olivier Clerc says\n\nAugust 23, 2019 at 1:32 pm\n\nThat\u2019s a fantastic essay, Charles ! Thank you so much. Do you allow me to have\nit translated and shared in French ? It is so much needed. I work a lot on\nstories and narratives, I have translated several books by my friend Dr Lewis\nMehl-Madrona, and anything that goes in that direction needs to have an\naudience as wide as possible.

Koyo H Masore says\n\nSeptember 21, 2019 at 12:28 am\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about how to lead a more peaceful life for quite some time.\nSome days I feel a bit overwhelmed with everything happening in my life and\nthe world.

Anand says\n\nSeptember 25, 2019 at 9:54 am\n\nAwesome narrative. If we could add some science about the structure of the\nlife atom or soul that takes the form of the cute little baby you described in\nthe passage it would complete the narrative. I am not a good writer like you\nbut have great content about coexistence. A set of 16 books which explains\nevery single sub atomic particle to the whole universe. I tried making a small\npresentation of the same. https://www.slideshare.net/AnandDamani/knowledge-to-\ncreate-a-heavenly-experience-and-live-it-always Would love to exchange more\nthoughts and start the process of setting the world in order.\n\nAnand.\n\n  16. Tristan Mules says\n\nSeptember 26, 2019 at 4:40 am\n\nThanks Charles. This has been your drive for a long time... and its such a\nworth cause. Transferable to so many of our modern issues of objectification.\n\nI would like to point out some demonisation and group think that I see\noccurring often enough these days. You mentioned the misogyny of killing your\nown mother, but what about the misandry of killing your own father? What an\neasy thing to overlook in our time of \u2018toxic\u2019 masculinity, the patriarchy and\nthe backswing against men. Its very cool to jump on the feminist bandwagon and\nuse words like that, but not so cool to point out discrimination against men,\nby women.\n\n  17. tita says\n\nOctober 15, 2019 at 4:06 am\n\nJust beautiful thank you\n\n  18.

Bertrand Canac says\n\nApril 27, 2020 at 3:39 pm\n\nThe basis of peace is happiness. Peace is within, in the silence and bliss of\npure consciousness, beyond the noise of thoughts. Only when a man is\npermanently established in the bliss of pure consciousness can his individual\npeace be real and permanent. It is only when enough people will live the bliss\nof the silent state of their own consciousness, that world peace will be real\nand permanent. Bertrand Canac\n\n  21. kamir bouchareb st says\n\nJune 9, 2020 at 5:38 pm\n\nthanks for the last information\n\n  22.

But as a middle class kid who has clearly had an\neasy life, Charles has no insight into the life and mindset of someone who is\noppressed and lives in poverty. He is not aware that for a person in that\nposition, there IS a need to fight against \u201cthe other\u201d, namely, the oppressor\nwho placed him there. Charles\u2019 philosophy only makes sense if you\u2019re from the\nprivileged class. You think a black man living in poverty, trying to feed his\nkids working a shit job for minimum wage would buy Charles\u2019 \u2018solutions\u2019 ? I\ncan see it now. \u201cJust chill out, brother, we\u2019re all interconnected. We\u2019re all\nin this together. There is no \u201cother.\u201d We\u2019re one human race. Trust the higher\nintelligence. There is no one to fight.\u201d How do you think that would go down?\nWhat Charles says is true on a metaphysical level, but when we consider social\nstructure and class, it\u2019s not anything that an oppressed person could relate\nto. Nor a mother who lost her home and child to US bombs in Syria. Nor a\nperson who had their drinking water poisoned by corporate activities.\nBasically, most people in this world. For those who have suffered most from\nthe social order established and maintained by the ruling class, Charles\u2019\n\u2018solutions\u2019 are unacceptable.\n\n  23. kamir bouchareb st says\n\nJuly 7, 2020 at 3:09 am\n\nnice topic\n\n  24. kamir bouchareb st says\n\nAugust 31, 2020 at 6:00 pm\n\nvery good\n\n  25. kamir bouchareb st says\n\nSeptember 18, 2020 at 6:22 am\n\nthanks for the last information\n\n  26. Vanessa says\n\nJuly 26, 2021 at 4:38 pm\n\nPowerful paper and so important. For my I have always felt my life work is t\nbecome radically, unconditionally loving. True love is unconditional. But I,\nlike many people, have some serious trauma. And an impact of that is a need\nfor control where in the past I had no control. To heal from trauma there is a\nneed either for the safety as you speak of in the essay, or to create the\nsafety you do not feel via control. So my question is, how do we let go of\nthis deep, unconscious need in favour of the complexity and\ninterconnectedness, when safety is otherwise not apparent?\n\n## Primary Sidebar\n\nAudio Essays\n\n### All Essays\n\n#### Peace-building\n\n#### Time to Push\n\n#### The Rehearsal is Over\n\n#### Some Stuff I\u2019m Reading\n\n#### Beyond Industrial Medicine\n\n#### A Temple of this Earth\n\n#### The Sacrificial King\n\n#### Words to a Young Man\n\n#### How It Is Going to Be\n\n#### What I\u2019m doing here\n\n#### Charles Eisenstein, Antisemite\n\n#### Mob Morality and the Unvaxxed\n\n#### Fascism and the Antifestival\n\n#### The Death of the Festival\n\n#### Source Temple and the Great Reset\n\n#### To Reason with a Madman\n\n#### From QAnon\u2019s Dark Mirror, Hope\n\n#### World on Fire\n\n#### We Can Do Better Than This\n\n#### The Banquet of Whiteness\n\n#### The Cure of the Earth\n\n#### Numb\n\n#### The Conspiracy Myth\n\n#### The Coronation\n\n#### Extinction and the Revolution of Love\n\n#### The Amazon: How do we heal a burning heart?\n\n#### Xylella: Supervillain or Symptom\n\n#### Making the Universe Great Again\n\n#### Every Act a Ceremony\n\n#### The Polarization Trap\n\n#### Living in the Gift\n\n#### A Little Heartbreak\n\n#### Initiation into a Living Planet\n\n#### Why I am Afraid of Global Cooling\n\n#### Olive Trees and the Cry of the Land\n\n#### Our New, Happy Life?

Feel free to copy and share.\n\n# The Coronation\n\nFor years, normality has been stretched nearly to its breaking point, a rope\npulled tighter and tighter, waiting for a nip of the black swan\u2019s beak to snap\nit in two. Now that the rope has snapped, do we tie its ends back together, or\nshall we undo its dangling braids still further, to see what we might weave\nfrom them?\n\nCovid-19 is showing us that when humanity is united in common cause,\nphenomenally rapid change is possible. None of the world\u2019s problems are\ntechnically difficult to solve; they originate in human disagreement. In\ncoherency, humanity\u2019s creative powers are boundless. A few months ago, a\nproposal to halt commercial air travel would have seemed preposterous.\nLikewise for the radical changes we are making in our social behavior,\neconomy, and the role of government in our lives. Covid demonstrates the power\nof our collective will when we agree on what is important. What else might we\nachieve, in coherency? What do we want to achieve, and what world shall we\ncreate? That is always the next question when anyone awakens to their power.\n\nCovid-19 is like a rehab intervention that breaks the addictive hold of\nnormality. To interrupt a habit is to make it visible; it is to turn it from a\ncompulsion to a choice. When the crisis subsides, we might have occasion to\nask whether we want to return to normal, or whether there might be something\nwe\u2019ve seen during this break in the routines that we want to bring into the\nfuture. We might ask, after so many have lost their jobs, whether all of them\nare the jobs the world most needs, and whether our labor and creativity would\nbe better applied elsewhere. We might ask, having done without it for a while,\nwhether we really need so much air travel, Disneyworld vacations, or trade\nshows. What parts of the economy will we want to restore, and what parts might\nwe choose to let go of? And on a darker note, what among the things that are\nbeing taken away right now \u2013 civil liberties, freedom of assembly, sovereignty\nover our bodies, in-person gatherings, hugs, handshakes, and public life \u2013\nmight we need to exert intentional political and personal will to restore?\n\nFor most of my life, I have had the feeling that humanity was nearing a\ncrossroads. Always, the crisis, the collapse, the break was imminent, just\naround the bend, but it didn\u2019t come and it didn\u2019t come. Imagine walking a\nroad, and up ahead you see it, you see the crossroads. It\u2019s just over the\nhill, around the bend, past the woods. Cresting the hill, you see you were\nmistaken, it was a mirage, it was farther away than you thought. You keep\nwalking. Sometimes it comes into view, sometimes it disappears from sight and\nit seems like this road goes on forever. Maybe there isn\u2019t a crossroads. No,\nthere it is again! Always it is almost here. Never is it here.\n\nNow, all of a sudden, we go around a bend and here it is. We stop, hardly able\nto believe that now it is happening, hardly able to believe, after years of\nconfinement to the road of our predecessors, that now we finally have a\nchoice. We are right to stop, stunned at the newness of our situation. Because\nof the hundred paths that radiate out in front of us, some lead in the same\ndirection we\u2019ve already been headed. Some lead to hell on earth. And some lead\nto a world more healed and more beautiful than we ever dared believe to be\npossible.\n\nI write these words with the aim of standing here with you \u2013 bewildered,\nscared maybe, yet also with a sense of new possibility \u2013 at this point of\ndiverging paths. Let us gaze down some of them and see where they lead.\n\n* * *\n\nI heard this story last week from a friend. She was in a grocery store and saw\na woman sobbing in the aisle. Flouting social distancing rules, she went to\nthe woman and gave her a hug. \u201cThank you,\u201d the woman said, \u201cthat is the first\ntime anyone has hugged me for ten days.\u201d\n\nGoing without hugs for a few weeks seems a small price to pay if it will stem\nan epidemic that could take millions of lives. There is a strong argument for\nsocial distancing in the near term: to prevent a sudden surge of Covid cases\nfrom overwhelming the medical system. I would like to put that argument in a\nlarger context, especially as we look to the long term. Lest we\ninstitutionalize distancing and reengineer society around it, let us be aware\nof what choice we are making and why.\n\nThe same goes for the other changes happening around the coronavirus epidemic.\nSome commentators have observed how it plays neatly into an agenda of\ntotalitarian control. A frightened public accepts abridgments of civil\nliberties that are otherwise hard to justify, such as the tracking of\neveryone\u2019s movements at all times, forcible medical treatment, involuntary\nquarantine, restrictions on travel and the freedom of assembly, censorship of\nwhat the authorities deem to be disinformation, suspension of habeas corpus,\nand military policing of civilians. Many of these were underway before\nCovid-19; since its advent, they have been irresistible. The same goes for the\nautomation of commerce; the transition from participation in sports and\nentertainment to remote viewing; the migration of life from public to private\nspaces; the transition away from place-based schools toward online education,\nthe decline of brick-and-mortar stores, and the movement of human work and\nleisure onto screens. Covid-19 is accelerating preexisting trends, political,\neconomic, and social.\n\nWhile all the above are, in the short term, justified on the grounds of\nflattening the curve (the epidemiological growth curve), we are also hearing a\nlot about a \u201cnew normal\u201d; that is to say, the changes may not be temporary at\nall. Since the threat of infectious disease, like the threat of terrorism,\nnever goes away, control measures can easily become permanent. If we were\ngoing in this direction anyway, the current justification must be part of a\ndeeper impulse. I will analyze this impulse in two parts: the reflex of\ncontrol, and the war on death. Thus understood, an initiatory opportunity\nemerges, one that we are seeing already in the form of the solidarity,\ncompassion, and care that Covid-19 has inspired.\n\nThe Reflex of Control\n\nAt the current writing, official statistics say that about 25,000 people have\ndied from Covid-19. By the time it runs its course, the death toll could be\nten times or a hundred times bigger, or even, if the most alarming guesses are\nright, a thousand times bigger. Each one of these people has loved ones,\nfamily and friends. Compassion and conscience call us to do what we can to\navert unnecessary tragedy. This is personal for me: my own infinitely dear but\nfrail mother is among the most vulnerable to a disease that kills mostly the\naged and the infirm.\n\nWhat will the final numbers be? That question is impossible to answer at the\ntime of this writing. Early reports were alarming; for weeks the official\nnumber from Wuhan, circulated endlessly in the media, was a shocking 3.4%.\nThat, coupled with its highly contagious nature, pointed to tens of millions\nof deaths worldwide, or even as many as 100 million. More recently, estimates\nhave plunged as it has become apparent that most cases are mild or\nasymptomatic. Since testing has been skewed towards the seriously ill, the\ndeath rate has looked artificially high. In South Korea, where hundreds of\nthousands of people with mild symptoms have been tested, the reported case\nfatality rate is around 1%. In Germany, whose testing also extends to many\nwith mild symptoms, the fatality rate is 0.4%. A recent paper in the journal\nScience argues that 86% of infections have been undocumented, which points to\na much lower mortality rate than the current case fatality rate would\nindicate.\n\nThe story of the Diamond Princess cruise ship bolsters this view. Of the 3,711\npeople on board, about 20% have tested positive for the virus; less than half\nof those had symptoms, and eight have died. A cruise ship is a perfect setting\nfor contagion, and there was plenty of time for the virus to spread on board\nbefore anyone did anything about it, yet only a fifth were infected.\nFurthermore, the cruise ship\u2019s population was heavily skewed (as are most\ncruise ships) toward the elderly: nearly a third of the passengers were over\nage 70, and more than half were over age 60. A research team concluded from\nthe large number of asymptomatic cases that the true fatality rate in China is\naround 0.5%. That is still five times higher than flu. Based on the above (and\nadjusting for much younger demographics in Africa and South and Southeast\nAsia) my guess is about 200,000-300,000 deaths in the US \u2013 more if the medical\nsystem is overwhelmed, less if infections are spread out over time \u2013 and 3\nmillion globally. Those are serious numbers. Not since the Hong Kong Flu\npandemic of 1968/9 has the world experienced anything like it.\n\nMy guesses could easily be off by an order of magnitude. Every day the media\nreports the total number of Covid-19 cases, but no one has any idea what the\ntrue number is, because only a tiny proportion of the population has been\ntested. If tens of millions have the virus, asymptomatically, we would not\nknow it. Further complicating the matter is the high rate of false positives\nfor existing testing, possibly as high as 80%. (And see here for even more\nalarming uncertainties about test accuracy.) Let me repeat: no one knows what\nis really happening, including me. Let us be aware of two contradictory\ntendencies in human affairs. The first is the tendency for hysteria to feed on\nitself, to exclude data points that don\u2019t play into the fear, and to create\nthe world in its image. The second is denial, the irrational rejection of\ninformation that might disrupt normalcy and comfort. As Daniel Schmactenberger\nasks, How do you know what you believe is true?\n\nIn the face of the uncertainty, I\u2019d like to make a prediction: The crisis will\nplay out so that we never will know. If the final death tally, which will\nitself be the subject of dispute, is lower than feared, some will say that is\nbecause the controls worked. Others will say it is because the disease wasn\u2019t\nas dangerous as we were told.\n\nTo me, the most baffling puzzle is why at the present writing there seem to be\nno new cases in China. The government didn\u2019t initiate its lockdown until well\nafter the virus was established. It should have spread widely during Chinese\nNew Year, when every plane, train, and bus is packed with people traveling all\nover the country. What is going on here? Again, I don\u2019t know, and neither do\nyou.\n\nWhether the final global death toll is 50,000 or 500,000 or 5 million, let\u2019s\nlook at some other numbers to get some perspective. My point is NOT that Covid\nisn\u2019t so bad and we shouldn\u2019t do anything. Bear with me. Last year, according\nto the FAO, five million children worldwide died of hunger (among 162 million\nwho are stunted and 51 million who are wasted). That is 200 times more people\nthan have died so far from Covid-19, yet no government has declared a state of\nemergency or asked that we radically alter our way of life to save them. Nor\ndo we see a comparable level of alarm and action around suicide \u2013 the mere tip\nof an iceberg of despair and depression \u2013 which kills over a million people a\nyear globally and 50,000 in the USA. Or drug overdoses, which kill 70,000 in\nthe USA, the autoimmunity epidemic, which affects 23.5 million (NIH figure) to\n50 million (AARDA), or obesity, which afflicts well over 100 million. Why, for\nthat matter, are we not in a frenzy about averting nuclear armageddon or\necological collapse, but, to the contrary, pursue choices that magnify those\nvery dangers?\n\nPlease, the point here is not that we haven\u2019t changed our ways to stop\nchildren from starving, so we shouldn\u2019t change them for Covid either. It is\nthe contrary: If we can change so radically for Covid-19, we can do it for\nthese other conditions too. Let us ask why are we able to unify our collective\nwill to stem this virus, but not to address other grave threats to humanity.\nWhy, until now, has society been so frozen in its existing trajectory?\n\nThe answer is revealing. Simply, in the face of world hunger, addiction,\nautoimmunity, suicide, or ecological collapse, we as a society do not know\nwhat to do. Our go-to crisis responses, all of which are some version of\ncontrol, aren\u2019t very effective in addressing these conditions. Now along comes\na contagious epidemic, and finally we can spring into action. It is a crisis\nfor which control works: quarantines, lockdowns, isolation, hand-washing;\ncontrol of movement, control of information, control of our bodies. That makes\nCovid a convenient receptacle for our inchoate fears, a place to channel our\ngrowing sense of helplessness in the face of the changes overtaking the world.\nCovid-19 is a threat that we know how to meet. Unlike so many of our other\nfears, Covid-19 offers a plan.\n\nOur civilization\u2019s established institutions are increasingly helpless to meet\nthe challenges of our time. How they welcome a challenge that they finally can\nmeet. How eager they are to embrace it as a paramount crisis. How naturally\ntheir systems of information management select for the most alarming\nportrayals of it. How easily the public joins the panic, embracing a threat\nthat the authorities can handle as a proxy for the various unspeakable threats\nthat they cannot.\n\nToday, most of our challenges no longer succumb to force. Our antibiotics and\nsurgery fail to meet the surging health crises of autoimmunity, addiction, and\nobesity. Our guns and bombs, built to conquer armies, are useless to erase\nhatred abroad or keep domestic violence out of our homes. Our police and\nprisons cannot heal the breeding conditions of crime. Our pesticides cannot\nrestore ruined soil. Covid-19 recalls the good old days when the challenges of\ninfectious diseases succumbed to modern medicine and hygiene, at the same time\nas the Nazis succumbed to the war machine, and nature itself succumbed, or so\nit seemed, to technological conquest and improvement. It recalls the days when\nour weapons worked and the world seemed indeed to be improving with each\ntechnology of control.\n\nWhat kind of problem succumbs to domination and control? The kind caused by\nsomething from the outside, something Other. When the cause of the problem is\nsomething intimate to ourselves, like homelessness or inequality, addiction or\nobesity, there is nothing to war against. We may try to install an enemy,\nblaming, for example, the billionaires, Vladimir Putin, or the Devil, but then\nwe miss key information, such as the ground conditions that allow billionaires\n(or viruses) to replicate in the first place.\n\nIf there is one thing our civilization is good at, it is fighting an enemy. We\nwelcome opportunities to do what we are good at, which prove the validity of\nour technologies, systems, and worldview. And so, we manufacture enemies, cast\nproblems like crime, terrorism, and disease into us-versus-them terms, and\nmobilize our collective energies toward those endeavors that can be seen that\nway. Thus, we single out Covid-19 as a call to arms, reorganizing society as\nif for a war effort, while treating as normal the possibility of nuclear\narmageddon, ecological collapse, and five million children starving.\n\nThe Conspiracy Narrative\n\nBecause Covid-19 seems to justify so many items on the totalitarian wish list,\nthere are those who believe it to be a deliberate power play. It is not my\npurpose to advance that theory nor to debunk it, although I will offer some\nmeta-level comments. First a brief overview.\n\nThe theories (there are many variants) talk about Event 201 (sponsored by the\nGates Foundation, CIA, etc. last September), and a 2010 Rockefeller Foundation\nwhite paper detailing a scenario called \u201cLockstep,\u201d both of which lay out the\nauthoritarian response to a hypothetical pandemic. They observe that the\ninfrastructure, technology, and legislative framework for martial law has been\nin preparation for many years. All that was needed, they say, was a way to\nmake the public embrace it, and now that has come. Whether or not current\ncontrols are permanent, a precedent is being set for:\n\n  * \u2022 The tracking of people\u2019s movements at all times (because coronavirus)\n  * \u2022 The suspension of freedom of assembly (because coronavirus)\n  * \u2022 The military policing of civilians (because coronavirus)\n  * \u2022 Extrajudicial, indefinite detention (quarantine, because coronavirus)\n  * \u2022 The banning of cash (because coronavirus)\n  * \u2022 Censorship of the Internet (to combat disinformation, because coronavirus)\n  * \u2022 Compulsory vaccination and other medical treatment, establishing the state\u2019s sovereignty over our bodies (because coronavirus)\n  * \u2022 The classification of all activities and destinations into the expressly permitted and the expressly forbidden (you can leave your house for this, but not that), eliminating the un-policed, non-juridical gray zone. That totality is the very essence of totalitarianism. Necessary now though, because, well, coronavirus.\n\nThis is juicy material for conspiracy theories. For all I know, one of those\ntheories could be true; however, the same progression of events could unfold\nfrom an unconscious systemic tilt toward ever-increasing control. Where does\nthis tilt come from? It is woven into civilization\u2019s DNA. For millennia,\ncivilization (as opposed to small-scale traditional cultures) has understood\nprogress as a matter of extending control onto the world: domesticating the\nwild, conquering the barbarians, mastering the forces of nature, and ordering\nsociety according to law and reason. The ascent of control accelerated with\nthe Scientific Revolution, which launched \u201cprogress\u201d to new heights: the\nordering of reality into objective categories and quantities, and the\nmastering of materiality with technology. Finally, the social sciences\npromised to use the same means and methods to fulfill the ambition (which goes\nback to Plato and Confucius) to engineer a perfect society.\n\nThose who administer civilization will therefore welcome any opportunity to\nstrengthen their control, for after all, it is in service to a grand vision of\nhuman destiny: the perfectly ordered world, in which disease, crime, poverty,\nand perhaps suffering itself can be engineered out of existence. No nefarious\nmotives are necessary. Of course they would like to keep track of everyone \u2013\nall the better to ensure the common good. For them, Covid-19 shows how\nnecessary that is. \u201cCan we afford democratic freedoms in light of the\ncoronavirus?\u201d they ask. \u201cMust we now, out of necessity, sacrifice those for\nour own safety?\u201d It is a familiar refrain, for it has accompanied other crises\nin the past, like 9/11.\n\nTo rework a common metaphor, imagine a man with a hammer, stalking around\nlooking for a reason to use it. Suddenly he sees a nail sticking out. He\u2019s\nbeen looking for a nail for a long time, pounding on screws and bolts and not\naccomplishing much. He inhabits a worldview in which hammers are the best\ntools, and the world can be made better by pounding in the nails. And here is\na nail! We might suspect that in his eagerness he has placed the nail there\nhimself, but it hardly matters. Maybe it isn\u2019t even a nail that\u2019s sticking\nout, but it resembles one enough to start pounding. When the tool is at the\nready, an opportunity will arise to use it.\n\nAnd I will add, for those inclined to doubt the authorities, maybe this time\nit really is a nail. In that case, the hammer is the right tool \u2013 and the\nprinciple of the hammer will emerge the stronger, ready for the screw, the\nbutton, the clip, and the tear.\n\nEither way, the problem we deal with here is much deeper than that of\noverthrowing an evil coterie of Illuminati. Even if they do exist, given the\ntilt of civilization, the same trend would persist without them, or a new\nIlluminati would arise to assume the functions of the old.\n\nTrue or false, the idea that the epidemic is some monstrous plot perpetrated\nby evildoers upon the public is not so far from the mindset of find-the-\npathogen. It is a crusading mentality, a war mentality. It locates the source\nof a sociopolitical illness in a pathogen against which we may then fight, a\nvictimizer separate from ourselves. It risks ignoring the conditions that make\nsociety fertile ground for the plot to take hold. Whether that ground was sown\ndeliberately or by the wind is, for me, a secondary question.\n\nWhat I will say next is relevant whether or not SARS-CoV2 is a genetically\nengineered bioweapon, is related to 5G rollout, is being used to prevent\n\u201cdisclosure,\u201d is a Trojan horse for totalitarian world government, is more\ndeadly than we\u2019ve been told, is less deadly than we\u2019ve been told, originated\nin a Wuhan biolab, originated at Fort Detrick, or is exactly as the CDC and\nWHO have been telling us. It applies even if everyone is totally wrong about\nthe role of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the current epidemic. I have my opinions,\nbut if there is one thing I have learned through the course of this emergency\nis that I don\u2019t really know what is happening. I don\u2019t see how anyone can,\namidst the seething farrago of news, fake news, rumors, suppressed\ninformation, conspiracy theories, propaganda, and politicized narratives that\nfill the Internet. I wish a lot more people would embrace not knowing. I say\nthat both to those who embrace the dominant narrative, as well as to those who\nhew to dissenting ones. What information might we be blocking out, in order to\nmaintain the integrity of our viewpoints? Let\u2019s be humble in our beliefs: it\nis a matter of life and death.\n\nThe War on Death\n\nMy 7-year-old son hasn\u2019t seen or played with another child for two weeks.\nMillions of others are in the same boat. Most would agree that a month without\nsocial interaction for all those children a reasonable sacrifice to save a\nmillion lives. But how about to save 100,000 lives? And what if the sacrifice\nis not for a month but for a year? Five years? Different people will have\ndifferent opinions on that, according to their underlying values.\n\nLet\u2019s replace the foregoing questions with something more personal, that\npierces the inhuman utilitarian thinking that turns people into statistics and\nsacrifices some of them for something else. The relevant question for me is,\nWould I ask all the nation\u2019s children to forego play for a season, if it would\nreduce my mother\u2019s risk of dying, or for that matter, my own risk? Or I might\nask, Would I decree the end of human hugging and handshakes, if it would save\nmy own life? This is not to devalue Mom\u2019s life or my own, both of which are\nprecious. I am grateful for every day she is still with us. But these\nquestions bring up deep issues. What is the right way to live? What is the\nright way to die?\n\nThe answer to such questions, whether asked on behalf of oneself or on behalf\nof society at large, depends on how we hold death and how much we value play,\ntouch, and togetherness, along with civil liberties and personal freedom.\nThere is no easy formula to balance these values.\n\nOver my lifetime I\u2019ve seen society place more and more emphasis on safety,\nsecurity, and risk reduction. It has especially impacted childhood: as a young\nboy it was normal for us to roam a mile from home unsupervised \u2013 behavior that\nwould earn parents a visit from Child Protective Services today. It also\nmanifests in the form of latex gloves for more and more professions; hand\nsanitizer everywhere; locked, guarded, and surveilled school buildings;\nintensified airport and border security; heightened awareness of legal\nliability and liability insurance; metal detectors and searches before\nentering many sports arenas and public buildings, and so on. Writ large, it\ntakes the form of the security state.\n\nThe mantra \u201csafety first\u201d comes from a value system that makes survival top\npriority, and that depreciates other values like fun, adventure, play, and the\nchallenging of limits. Other cultures had different priorities. For instance,\nmany traditional and indigenous cultures are much less protective of children,\nas documented in Jean Liedloff\u2019s classic, The Continuum Concept. They allow\nthem risks and responsibilities that would seem insane to most modern people,\nbelieving that this is necessary for children to develop self-reliance and\ngood judgement. I think most modern people, especially younger people, retain\nsome of this inherent willingness to sacrifice safety in order to live life\nfully. The surrounding culture, however, lobbies us relentlessly to live in\nfear, and has constructed systems that embody fear. In them, staying safe is\nover-ridingly important. Thus we have a medical system in which most decisions\nare based on calculations of risk, and in which the worst possible outcome,\nmarking the physician\u2019s ultimate failure, is death. Yet all the while, we know\nthat death awaits us regardless. A life saved actually means a death\npostponed.\n\nThe ultimate fulfillment of civilization\u2019s program of control would be to\ntriumph over death itself. Failing that, modern society settles for a\nfacsimile of that triumph: denial rather than conquest. Ours is a society of\ndeath denial, from its hiding away of corpses, to its fetish for youthfulness,\nto its warehousing of old people in nursing homes. Even its obsession with\nmoney and property \u2013 extensions of the self, as the word \u201cmine\u201d indicates \u2013\nexpresses the delusion that the impermanent self can be made permanent through\nits attachments. All this is inevitable given the story-of-self that modernity\noffers: the separate individual in a world of Other. Surrounded by genetic,\nsocial, and economic competitors, that self must protect and dominate in order\nto thrive. It must do everything it can to forestall death, which (in the\nstory of separation) is total annihilation. Biological science has even taught\nus that our very nature is to maximize our chances of surviving and\nreproducing.\n\nI asked a friend, a medical doctor who has spent time with the Q\u2019ero on Peru,\nwhether the Q\u2019ero would (if they could) intubate someone to prolong their\nlife. \u201cOf course not,\u201d she said. \u201cThey would summon the shaman to help him die\nwell.\u201d Dying well (which isn\u2019t necessarily the same as dying painlessly) is\nnot much in today\u2019s medical vocabulary. No hospital records are kept on\nwhether patients die well. That would not be counted as a positive outcome. In\nthe world of the separate self, death is the ultimate catastrophe.\n\nBut is it? Consider this perspective from Dr. Lissa Rankin: \u201cNot all of us\nwould want to be in an ICU, isolated from loved ones with a machine breathing\nfor us, at risk of dying alone- even if it means they might increase their\nchance of survival. Some of us might rather be held in the arms of loved ones\nat home, even if that means our time has come.... Remember, death is no\nending. Death is going home.\u201d\n\nWhen the self is understood as relational, interdependent, even inter-\nexistent, then it bleeds over into the other, and the other bleeds over into\nthe self. Understanding the self as a locus of consciousness in a matrix of\nrelationship, one no longer searches for an enemy as the key to understanding\nevery problem, but looks instead for imbalances in relationships. The War on\nDeath gives way to the quest to live well and fully, and we see that fear of\ndeath is actually fear of life. How much of life will we forego to stay safe?\n\nTotalitarianism \u2013 the perfection of control \u2013 is the inevitable end product of\nthe mythology of the separate self. What else but a threat to life, like a\nwar, would merit total control? Thus Orwell identified perpetual war as a\ncrucial component of the Party\u2019s rule.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the program of control, death denial, and the separate\nself, the assumption that public policy should seek to minimize the number of\ndeaths is nearly beyond question, a goal to which other values like play,\nfreedom, etc. are subordinate. Covid-19 offers occasion to broaden that view.\nYes, let us hold life sacred, more sacred than ever. Death teaches us that.\nLet us hold each person, young or old, sick or well, as the sacred, precious,\nbeloved being that they are. And in the circle of our hearts, let us make room\nfor other sacred values too. To hold life sacred is not just to live long, it\nis to live well and right and fully.\n\nLike all fear, the fear around the coronavirus hints at what might lie beyond\nit. Anyone who has experienced the passing of someone close knows that death\nis a portal to love. Covid-19 has elevated death to prominence in the\nconsciousness of a society that denies it. On the other side of the fear, we\ncan see the love that death liberates. Let it pour forth. Let it saturate the\nsoil of our culture and fill its aquifers so that it seeps up through the\ncracks of our crusted institutions, our systems, and our habits. Some of these\nmay die too.\n\nWhat world shall we live in?\n\nHow much of life do we want to sacrifice at the altar of security? If it keeps\nus safer, do we want to live in a world where human beings never congregate?\nDo we want to wear masks in public all the time? Do we want to be medically\nexamined every time we travel, if that will save some number of lives a year?\nAre we willing to accept the medicalization of life in general, handing over\nfinal sovereignty over our bodies to medical authorities (as selected by\npolitical ones)? Do we want every event to be a virtual event? How much are we\nwilling to live in fear?\n\nCovid-19 will eventually subside, but the threat of infectious disease is\npermanent. Our response to it sets a course for the future. Public life,\ncommunal life, the life of shared physicality has been dwindling over several\ngenerations. Instead of shopping at stores, we get things delivered to our\nhomes. Instead of packs of kids playing outside, we have play dates and\ndigital adventures. Instead of the public square, we have the online forum. Do\nwe want to continue to insulate ourselves still further from each other and\nthe world?\n\nIt is not hard to imagine, especially if social distancing is successful, that\nCovid-19 persists beyond the 18 months we are being told to expect for it to\nrun its course. It is not hard to imagine that new viruses will emerge during\nthat time. It is not hard to imagine that emergency measures will become\nnormal (so as to forestall the possibility of another outbreak), just as the\nstate of emergency declared after 9/11 is still in effect today. It is not\nhard to imagine that (as we are being told), reinfection is possible, so that\nthe disease will never run its course. That means that the temporary changes\nin our way of life may become permanent.\n\nTo reduce the risk of another pandemic, shall we choose to live in a society\nwithout hugs, handshakes, and high-fives, forever more? Shall we choose to\nlive in a society where we no longer gather en masse? Shall the concert, the\nsports competition, and the festival be a thing of the past? Shall children no\nlonger play with other children? Shall all human contact be mediated by\ncomputers and masks? No more dance classes, no more karate classes, no more\nconferences, no more churches? Is death reduction to be the standard by which\nto measure progress? Does human advancement mean separation? Is this the\nfuture?\n\nThe same question applies to the administrative tools required to control the\nmovement of people and the flow of information. At the present writing, the\nentire country is moving toward lockdown. In some countries, one must print\nout a form from a government website in order to leave the house. It reminds\nme of school, where one\u2019s location must be authorized at all times. Or of\nprison. Do we envision a future of electronic hall passes, a system where\nfreedom of movement is governed by state administrators and their software at\nall times, permanently? Where every movement is tracked, either permitted or\nprohibited? And, for our protection, where information that threatens our\nhealth (as decided, again, by various authorities) is censored for our own\ngood? In the face of an emergency, like unto a state of war, we accept such\nrestrictions and temporarily surrender our freedoms. Similar to 9/11, Covid-19\ntrumps all objections.\n\nFor the first time in history, the technological means exist to realize such a\nvision, at least in the developed world (for example, using cellphone location\ndata to enforce social distancing; see also here). After a bumpy transition,\nwe could live in a society where nearly all of life happens online: shopping,\nmeeting, entertainment, socializing, working, even dating. Is that what we\nwant? How many lives saved is that worth?\n\nI am sure that many of the controls in effect today will be partially relaxed\nin a few months. Partially relaxed, but at the ready. As long as infectious\ndisease remains with us, they are likely to be reimposed, again and again, in\nthe future, or be self-imposed in the form of habits. As Deborah Tannen says,\ncontributing to a Politico article on how coronavirus will change the world\npermanently, \u2018We know now that touching things, being with other people and\nbreathing the air in an enclosed space can be risky.... It could become second\nnature to recoil from shaking hands or touching our faces\u2014and we may all fall\nheir to society-wide OCD, as none of us can stop washing our hands.\u201d After\nthousands of years, millions of years, of touch, contact, and togetherness, is\nthe pinnacle of human progress to be that we cease such activities because\nthey are too risky?\n\nLife is Community\n\nThe paradox of the program of control is that its progress rarely advances us\nany closer to its goal. Despite security systems in almost every upper middle-\nclass home, people are no less anxious or insecure than they were a generation\nago. Despite elaborate security measures, the schools are not seeing fewer\nmass shootings. Despite phenomenal progress in medical technology, people have\nif anything become less healthy over the past thirty years, as chronic disease\nhas proliferated and life expectancy stagnated and, in the USA and Britain,\nstarted to decline.\n\nThe measures being instituted to control Covid-19, likewise, may end up\ncausing more suffering and death than they prevent. Minimizing deaths means\nminimizing the deaths that we know how to predict and measure. It is\nimpossible to measure the added deaths that might come from isolation-induced\ndepression, for instance, or the despair caused by unemployment, or the\nlowered immunity and deterioration in health that chronic fear can cause.\nLoneliness and lack of social contact has been shown to increase inflammation,\ndepression, and dementia. According to Lissa Rankin, M.D., air pollution\nincreases risk of dying by 6%, obesity by 23%, alcohol abuse by 37%, and\nloneliness by 45%.\n\nAnother danger that is off the ledger is the deterioration in immunity caused\nby excessive hygiene and distancing. It is not only social contact that is\nnecessary for health, it is also contact with the microbial world. Generally\nspeaking, microbes are not our enemies, they are our allies in health. A\ndiverse gut biome, comprising bacteria, viruses, yeasts, and other organisms,\nis essential for a well-functioning immune system, and its diversity is\nmaintained through contact with other people and with the world of life.\nExcessive hand-washing, overuse of antibiotics, aseptic cleanliness, and lack\nof human contact might do more harm than good. The resulting allergies and\nautoimmune disorders might be worse than the infectious disease they replace.\nSocially and biologically, health comes from community. Life does not thrive\nin isolation.\n\nSeeing the world in us-versus-them terms blinds us to the reality that life\nand health happen in community. To take the example of infectious diseases, we\nfail to look beyond the evil pathogen and ask, What is the role of viruses in\nthe microbiome? (See also here.) What are the body conditions under which\nharmful viruses proliferate? Why do some people have mild symptoms and others\nsevere ones (besides the catch-all non-explanation of \u201clow resistance\u201d)? What\npositive role might flus, colds, and other non-lethal diseases play in the\nmaintenance of health?\n\nWar-on-germs thinking brings results akin to those of the War on Terror, War\non Crime, War on Weeds, and the endless wars we fight politically and\ninterpersonally. First, it generates endless war; second, it diverts attention\nfrom the ground conditions that breed illness, terrorism, crime, weeds, and\nthe rest.\n\nDespite politicians\u2019 perennial claim that they pursue war for the sake of\npeace, war inevitably breeds more war. Bombing countries to kill terrorists\nnot only ignores the ground conditions of terrorism, it exacerbates those\nconditions. Locking up criminals not only ignores the conditions that breed\ncrime, it creates those conditions when it breaks up families and communities\nand acculturates the incarcerated to criminality. And regimes of antibiotics,\nvaccines, antivirals, and other medicines wreak havoc on body ecology, which\nis the foundation of strong immunity. Outside the body, the massive spraying\ncampaigns sparked by Zika, Dengue Fever, and now Covid-19 will visit untold\ndamage upon nature\u2019s ecology. Has anyone considered what the effects on the\necosystem will be when we douse it with antiviral compounds? Such a policy\n(which has been implemented in various places in China and India) is only\nthinkable from the mindset of separation, which does not understand that\nviruses are integral to the web of life.\n\nTo understand the point about ground conditions, consider some mortality\nstatistics from Italy (from its National Health Institute), based on an\nanalysis of hundreds of Covid-19 fatalities. Of those analyzed, less than 1%\nwere free of serious chronic health conditions. Some 75% suffered from\nhypertension, 35% from diabetes, 33% from cardiac ischemia, 24% from atrial\nfibrillation, 18% from low renal function, along with other conditions that I\ncouldn\u2019t decipher from the Italian report. Nearly half the deceased had three\nor more of these serious pathologies. Americans, beset by obesity, diabetes,\nand other chronic ailments, are at least as vulnerable as Italians. Should we\nblame the virus then (which killed few otherwise healthy people), or shall we\nblame underlying poor health? Here again the analogy of the taut rope applies.\nMillions of people in the modern world are in a precarious state of health,\njust waiting for something that would normally be trivial to send them over\nthe edge. Of course, in the short term we want to save their lives; the danger\nis that we lose ourselves in an endless succession of short terms, fighting\none infectious disease after another, and never engage the ground conditions\nthat make people so vulnerable. That is a much harder problem, because these\nground conditions will not change via fighting. There is no pathogen that\ncauses diabetes or obesity, addiction, depression, or PTSD. Their causes are\nnot an Other, not some virus separate from ourselves, and we its victims.\n\nEven in diseases like Covid-19, in which we can name a pathogenic virus,\nmatters are not so simple as a war between virus and victim. There is an\nalternative to the germ theory of disease that holds germs to be part of a\nlarger process. When conditions are right, they multiply in the body,\nsometimes killing the host, but also, potentially, improving the conditions\nthat accommodated them to begin with, for example by cleaning out accumulated\ntoxic debris via mucus discharge, or (metaphorically speaking) burning them up\nwith fever. Sometimes called \u201cterrain theory,\u201d it says that germs are more\nsymptom than cause of disease. As one meme explains it: \u201cYour fish is sick.\nGerm theory: isolate the fish. Terrain theory: clean the tank.\u201d\n\nA certain schizophrenia afflicts the modern culture of health. On the one\nhand, there is a burgeoning wellness movement that embraces alternative and\nholistic medicine. It advocates herbs, meditation, and yoga to boost immunity.\nIt validates the emotional and spiritual dimensions of health, such as the\npower of attitudes and beliefs to sicken or to heal. All of this seems to have\ndisappeared under the Covid tsunami, as society defaults to the old orthodoxy.\n\nCase in point: California acupuncturists have been forced to shut down, having\nbeen deemed \u201cnon-essential.\u201d This is perfectly understandable from the\nperspective of conventional virology. But as one acupuncturist on Facebook\nobserved, \u201cWhat about my patient who I\u2019m working with to get off opioids for\nhis back pain? He\u2019s going to have to start using them again.\u201d From the\nworldview of medical authority, alternative modalities, social interaction,\nyoga classes, supplements, and so on are frivolous when it comes to real\ndiseases caused by real viruses. They are relegated to an etheric realm of\n\u201cwellness\u201d in the face of a crisis. The resurgence of orthodoxy under Covid-19\nis so intense that anything remotely unconventional, such as intravenous\nvitamin C, was completely off the table in the United States until two days\nago (articles still abound \u201cdebunking\u201d the \u201cmyth\u201d that vitamin C can help\nfight Covid-19). Nor have I heard the CDC evangelize the benefits of\nelderberry extract, medicinal mushrooms, cutting sugar intake, NAC (N-acetyl\nL-cysteine), astragalus, or vitamin D. These are not just mushy speculation\nabout \u201cwellness,\u201d but are supported by extensive research and physiological\nexplanations. For example, NAC (general info, double-blind placebo-controlled\nstudy) has been shown to radically reduce incidence and severity of symptoms\nin flu-like illnesses.\n\nAs the statistics I offered earlier on autoimmunity, obesity, etc. indicate,\nAmerica and the modern world in general are facing a health crisis. Is the\nanswer to do what we\u2019ve been doing, only more thoroughly? The response so far\nto Covid has been to double down on the orthodoxy and sweep unconventional\npractices and dissenting viewpoints aside. Another response would be to widen\nour lens and examine the entire system, including who pays for it, how access\nis granted, and how research is funded, but also expanding out to include\nmarginal fields like herbal medicine, functional medicine, and energy\nmedicine. Perhaps we can take this opportunity to reevaluate prevailing\ntheories of illness, health, and the body. Yes, let\u2019s protect the sickened\nfish as best we can right now, but maybe next time we won\u2019t have to isolate\nand drug so many fish, if we can clean the tank.\n\nI\u2019m not telling you to run out right now and buy NAC or any other supplement,\nnor that we as a society should abruptly shift our response, cease social\ndistancing immediately, and start taking supplements instead. But we can use\nthe break in normal, this pause at a crossroads, to consciously choose what\npath we shall follow moving forward: what kind of healthcare system, what\nparadigm of health, what kind of society. This reevaluation is already\nhappening, as ideas like universal free healthcare in the USA gain new\nmomentum. And that path leads to forks as well. What kind of healthcare will\nbe universalized? Will it be merely available to all, or mandatory for all \u2013\neach citizen a patient, perhaps with an invisible ink barcode tattoo\ncertifying one is up to date on all compulsory vaccines and check-ups. Then\nyou can go to school, board a plane, or enter a restaurant. This is one path\nto the future that is available to us.\n\nAnother option is available now too. Instead of doubling down on control, we\ncould finally embrace the holistic paradigms and practices that have been\nwaiting on the margins, waiting for the center to dissolve so that, in our\nhumbled state, we can bring them into the center and build a new system around\nthem.\n\nThe Coronation\n\nThere is an alternative to the paradise of perfect control that our\ncivilization has so long pursued, and that recedes as fast as our progress,\nlike a mirage on the horizon. Yes, we can proceed as before down the path\ntoward greater insulation, isolation, domination, and separation. We can\nnormalize heightened levels of separation and control, believe that they are\nnecessary to keep us safe, and accept a world in which we are afraid to be\nnear each other. Or we can take advantage of this pause, this break in normal,\nto turn onto a path of reunion, of holism, of the restoring of lost\nconnections, of the repair of community and the rejoining of the web of life.\n\nDo we double down on protecting the separate self, or do we accept the\ninvitation into a world where all of us are in this together? It isn\u2019t just in\nmedicine we encounter this question: it visits us politically, economically,\nand in our personal lives as well. Take for example the issue of hoarding,\nwhich embodies the idea, \u201cThere won\u2019t be enough for everyone, so I am going to\nmake sure there is enough for me.\u201d Another response might be, \u201cSome don\u2019t have\nenough, so I will share what I have with them.\u201d Are we to be survivalists or\nhelpers? What is life for?\n\nOn a larger scale, people are asking questions that have until now lurked on\nactivist margins. What should we do about the homeless? What should we do\nabout the people in prisons? In Third World slums? What should we do about the\nunemployed? What about all the hotel maids, the Uber drivers, the plumbers and\njanitors and bus drivers and cashiers who cannot work from home? And so now,\nfinally, ideas like student debt relief and universal basic income are\nblossoming. \u201cHow do we protect those susceptible to Covid?\u201d invites us into\n\u201cHow do we care for vulnerable people in general?\u201d\n\nThat is the impulse that stirs in us, regardless of the superficialities of\nour opinions about Covid\u2019s severity, origin, or best policy to address it. It\nis saying, let\u2019s get serious about taking care of each other. Let\u2019s remember\nhow precious we all are and how precious life is. Let\u2019s take inventory of our\ncivilization, strip it down to its studs, and see if we can build one more\nbeautiful.\n\nAs Covid stirs our compassion, more and more of us realize that we don\u2019t want\nto go back to a normal so sorely lacking it. We have the opportunity now to\nforge a new, more compassionate normal.\n\nHopeful signs abound that this is happening. The United States government,\nwhich has long seemed the captive of heartless corporate interests, has\nunleashed hundreds of billions of dollars in direct payments to families.\nDonald Trump, not known as a paragon of compassion, has put a moratorium on\nforeclosures and evictions. Certainly one can take a cynical view of both\nthese developments; nonetheless, they embody the principle of caring for the\nvulnerable.\n\nFrom all over the world we hear stories of solidarity and healing. One friend\ndescribed sending $100 each to ten strangers who were in dire need. My son,\nwho until a few days ago worked at Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, said people were tipping at\nfive times the normal rate \u2013 and these are working class people, many of them\nHispanic truck drivers, who are economically insecure themselves. Doctors,\nnurses, and \u201cessential workers\u201d in other professions risk their lives to serve\nthe public. Here are some more examples of the love and kindness eruption,\ncourtesy of ServiceSpace:\n\nPerhaps we\u2019re in the middle of living into that new story. Imagine Italian\nairforce using Pavoratti, Spanish military doing acts of service, and street\npolice playing guitars \u2014 to *inspire*. Corporations giving unexpected wage\nhikes. Canadians starting \u201cKindness Mongering.\u201d Six year old in Australia\nadorably gifting her tooth fairy money, an 8th grader in Japan making 612\nmasks, and college kids everywhere buying groceries for elders. Cuba sending\nan army in \u201cwhite robes\u201d (doctors) to help Italy. A landlord allowing tenants\nto stay without rent, an Irish priest\u2019s poem going viral, disabled activitists\nproducing hand sanitizer. Imagine. Sometimes a crisis mirrors our deepest\nimpulse \u2014 that we can always respond with compassion.\n\nAs Rebecca Solnit describes in her marvelous book, A Paradise Built in Hell,\ndisaster often liberates solidarity. A more beautiful world shimmers just\nbeneath the surface, bobbing up whenever the systems that hold it underwater\nloosen their grip.\n\nFor a long time we, as a collective, have stood helpless in the face of an\never-sickening society. Whether it is declining health, decaying\ninfrastructure, depression, suicide, addiction, ecological degradation, or\nconcentration of wealth, the symptoms of civilizational malaise in the\ndeveloped world are plain to see, but we have been stuck in the systems and\npatterns that cause them. Now, Covid has gifted us a reset.\n\nA million forking paths lie before us. Universal basic income could mean an\nend to economic insecurity and the flowering of creativity as millions are\nfreed from the work that Covid has shown us is less necessary than we thought.\nOr it could mean, with the decimation of small businesses, dependency on the\nstate for a stipend that comes with strict conditions. The crisis could usher\nin totalitarianism or solidarity; medical martial law or a holistic\nrenaissance; greater fear of the microbial world, or greater resiliency in\nparticipation in it; permanent norms of social distancing, or a renewed desire\nto come together.\n\nWhat can guide us, as individuals and as a society, as we walk the garden of\nforking paths? At each junction, we can be aware of what we follow: fear or\nlove, self-preservation or generosity. Shall we live in fear and build a\nsociety based on it? Shall we live to preserve our separate selves? Shall we\nuse the crisis as a weapon against our political enemies? These are not all-\nor-nothing questions, all fear or all love. It is that a next step into love\nlies before us. It feels daring, but not reckless. It treasures life, while\naccepting death. And it trusts that with each step, the next will become\nvisible.\n\nPlease don\u2019t think that choosing love over fear can be accomplished solely\nthrough an act of will, and that fear too can be conquered like a virus. The\nvirus we face here is fear, whether it is fear of Covid-19, or fear of the\ntotalitarian response to it, and this virus too has its terrain. Fear, along\nwith addiction, depression, and a host of physical ills, flourishes in a\nterrain of separation and trauma: inherited trauma, childhood trauma,\nviolence, war, abuse, neglect, shame, punishment, poverty, and the muted,\nnormalized trauma that affects nearly everyone who lives in a monetized\neconomy, undergoes modern schooling, or lives without community or connection\nto place. This terrain can be changed, by trauma healing on a personal level,\nby systemic change toward a more compassionate society, and by transforming\nthe basic narrative of separation: the separate self in a world of other, me\nseparate from you, humanity separate from nature. To be alone is a primal\nfear, and modern society has rendered us more and more alone. But the time of\nReunion is here. Every act of compassion, kindness, courage, or generosity\nheals us from the story of separation, because it assures both actor and\nwitness that we are in this together.\n\nI will conclude by invoking one more dimension of the relationship between\nhumans and viruses. Viruses are integral to evolution, not just of humans but\nof all eukaryotes. Viruses can transfer DNA from organism to organism,\nsometimes inserting it into the germline (where it becomes heritable). Known\nas horizontal gene transfer, this is a primary mechanism of evolution,\nallowing life to evolve together much faster than is possible through random\nmutation. As Lynn Margulis once put it, we are our viruses.\n\nAnd now let me venture into speculative territory. Perhaps the great diseases\nof civilization have quickened our biological and cultural evolution,\nbestowing key genetic information and offering both individual and collective\ninitiation. Could the current pandemic be just that? Novel RNA codes are\nspreading from human to human, imbuing us with new genetic information; at the\nsame time, we are receiving other, esoteric, \u201ccodes\u201d that ride the back of the\nbiological ones, disrupting our narratives and systems in the same way that an\nillness disrupts bodily physiology. The phenomenon follows the template of\ninitiation: separation from normality, followed by a dilemma, breakdown, or\nordeal, followed (if it is to be complete) by reintegration and celebration.\n\nNow the question arises: Initiation into what? What is the specific nature and\npurpose of this initiation?The popular name for the pandemic offers a clue:\ncoronavirus. A corona is a crown. \u201cNovel coronavirus pandemic\u201d means \u201ca new\ncoronation for all.\u201d\n\nAlready we can feel the power of who we might become. A true sovereign does\nnot run in fear from life or from death. A true sovereign does not dominate\nand conquer (that is a shadow archetype, the Tyrant). The true sovereign\nserves the people, serves life, and respects the sovereignty of all people.\nThe coronation marks the emergence of the unconscious into consciousness, the\ncrystallization of chaos into order, the transcendence of compulsion into\nchoice. We become the rulers of that which had ruled us. The New World Order\nthat the conspiracy theorists fear is a shadow of the glorious possibility\navailable to sovereign beings. No longer the vassals of fear, we can bring\norder to the kingdom and build an intentional society on the love already\nshining through the cracks of the world of separation.\n\nCelo: 0x755582C923dB215d9eF7C4Ad3E03D29B2569ABb6\n\nLitecoin: ltc1qqtvtkl3h7mchy7m5jwpvqvt5uzka0yj3nffavu\n\nBitcoin: bc1q2a2czwhf4sgyx9f9ttf3c4ndt03eyh3uymjgzl\n\nDogecoin: DT9ECVrg9mPFADhN375WL9ULzcUZo8YEpN\n\nPolkadot: 15s6NSM75Kw6eMLoxm2u8qqbgQFYMnoYhvV1w1SaF9hwVpM4\n\nPolygon: 0xEBF0120A88Ec0058578e2D37C9fFdDc28f3673A6\n\nZcash: t1PUmhaoYTHJAk1yxmgpfEp27Uk4GHKqRig\n\nDonate & Support\n\nNotifications\n\n", "frontpage": false}
