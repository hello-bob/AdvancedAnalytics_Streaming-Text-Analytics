Jeffrey\nGreenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\nWhile the centenarian has taken the recurring misunderstandings with good\nhumor, she admits she wishes the glitch would be addressed, as it\u2019s made\ntraveling less predictable and more inconvenient.\n\n## Explore More\n\n### NYC firefighter, 36, dies of heart attack after being fired to pay for\nmigrants \u2014 leaving family with nothing\n\n### Slack co-founder's missing teen found in van with 26-year-old who's now\nfacing charges\n\n### Hotel in trendy NYC neighborhood quietly converted into shelter for\nmigrant families\n\nShe told the outlet that on one occasion, the airport didn\u2019t have motorized\ntransportation ready for her at the terminal because staffers were\nanticipating a baby, who would be carried or pushed in a stroller.\n\n\u201cI would like them to fix the computer, as my poor daughter had to carry all\nour luggage and apparel almost a mile from one gate to the other,\u201d she said.\n\nOn another trip, Patricia and her daughter Kris were stuck in limbo waiting\ninside a plane after every other passenger had disembarked because the flight\ncrew was unaware that a wheelchair was needed.\n\nThe elderly flier has taken the mix-ups in good humor but says she wishes that\nAmerican would address the glitch because it has caused hassles for her and\nher family. NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nBut she told the outlet that flight crews and airport staff have always been\nhelpful and kind in clearing up the confusion once they learn about it.\n\nPatricia, who flies from Chicago to Marquette, Mich., to see family once a\nyear, made the trip by herself until she was 97. She now depends on family to\naccompany her, since her vision has declined.\n\nWhat do you think? Post a comment.\n\nShe\u2019s already planning her next trip to Michigan this fall.\n\nAmerican Airlines did not respond to The Post\u2019s request for comment Sunday.\n\n### Share this article:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Email\n  * Copy\n\nFiled under\n\n  * airlines\n  * american airlines\n  * 4/28/24\n\nRead Next Ex-Wisconsin Univ. porn prof. still making $90K salary des...\n\n#### Trending Now in US News\n\n  * This story has been shared 104,306 times. 104,306\n\n### NYC firefighter, 36, dies of heart attack after being fired to pay for\nmigrants -- leaving family with nothing\n\n  * This story has been shared 77,892 times. 77,892\n\n### Slack co-founder's missing teen found in van with 26-year-old who's now\nfacing charges\n\n  * This story has been shared 31,521 times. 31,521\n\n### Hotel in trendy NYC neighborhood quietly converted into shelter for\nmigrant families\n\n  * This story has been shared 21,862 times. 21,862\n\n### 'Midtown Jane Doe' finally ID'd in eerie twist -- 20 years after remains\nfound in cement at former NYC hot spot\n\n## Now on Page Six\n\n  * ### Meryl Streep reveals Nicole Kidman skinny-dipped every morning filming \u2018Big Little Lies\u2019\n\n  * ### Kate Hudson reveals where her relationship stands with biological father Bill\n\n  * ### Megan Fox, MGK share intimate slow dance at Stagecoach after ending engagement\n\nSee All\n\n#### Video\n\n  * ### 13-year-old girl allegedly mobbed by parents, beaten by student in caught-on-video altercation at NY high school\n\n## Now on Decider\n\n  * ### \u2018Anyone But You\u2019s Big Sex Scene Finds Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell Steaming Up a Shower\n\n  * Ellen DeGeneres Says She \u201cHated\u201d The Way \u2018The Ellen DeGeneres Show\u2019 Ended: \u201cIt Was Devastating\u201d\n  * \u2018Golden Bachelor\u2019 Gerry Turner\u2019s Daughter Weighs In On Golden Divorce, Says Their Family Has Been Facing \u201cRage And Cruelty\u201d From Fans\n  * \u2018AHS: Delicate\u2019 Finale Leaves Fans Enraged: \u201cNone of This Makes Sense\u201d\n\nSee All\n\n## Covers\n\n### Today's Cover\n\n#### Front Cover Back Cover\n\n#### Flip for back cover\n\n### Browse Covers\n\n## More Stories\n\n### Page Six\n\n#### Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban\u2019s teenage daughters stun in rare red carpet\nappearance\n\n### NYPost\n\n#### NYC firefighter, 36, dies of heart attack after being fired to pay for\nmigrants -- leaving family with nothing\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Email\n  * YouTube\n\n## Share Link\n\nclick to copy\n\n## We Value Your Privacy\n\nWe and our 82 partners store and/or access information on a device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies to process personal data.
