Photograph: Jordan\nVonderhaar/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nConstruction industry\n\n# \u2018Workers end up paying the price\u2019: laborers call for safer building sites\n\nFalls, slips and trips accounted for 865 worker fatalities in 2022 \u2013 more than\n400 of whom worked in construction\n\nMichael Sainato\n\nShare\n\nWooden planks with nails covered the site where Antonio, a construction day\nlaborer in Houston, Texas, was helping clear fencing last December. The\ncontractor that hired him provided no protection, he said \u2013 so when he\nslipped, and a nail struck him just above the ankle, it became \u201creally\nswollen\u201d.\n\n\u2018It has really gotten out of hand\u2019: wage theft rampant in US construction\n\nRead more\n\nAntonio was given hydrogen peroxide, and the contractor promised to get him\nmedical attention the next day. But after developing a fever overnight, and\nwith his ankle still swollen, he took himself to the emergency room.\n\nUpon arrival, he was told if he had waited much longer, doctors might have\nneeded to amputate his leg below the knee. \u201cI spent about 16 days in the\nhospital,\u201d Antonio, who requested to omit his last name for fear of\nretaliation, said.\n\nAfter two weeks, the contractor \u2013 which had not picked up the phone the day\nafter his accident \u2013 got in touch. They wanted to know \u201cif I was ready to\nwork\u201d, Antonio said.\n\nHis injury was never reported to the proper authorities. He has not received\ncompensation.\n\nThe incident was not unusual.\n\nMore than 450,000 workers were injured by falls, slips and trips in 2021 and\n2022, according to official data, with 865 fatalities recorded in 2022 alone.\nOf those who died, more than 400 were construction workers, according to the\nCenter for Construction Research and Training.\n\nEmployers are required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\n(Osha) to protect workers from falls on the job, by providing guardrails,\nharnesses, scaffolding and personal safety gear when necessary, and provide\ntraining to workers.\n\n> A lot of workers don\u2019t feel comfortable enough to say, \u2018Hold on a second,\n> that\u2019s unsafe\u2019\n\n\u201cConstruction is a dangerous industry, but falls are preventable, 100%,\u201d said\nRyan Papariello, safety and health specialist at the Laborers\u2019 Health and\nSafety Fund of North America. \u201cWe know how to prevent these incidents.\u201d\n\nBut in many cases where injuries and fatalities of workers occur, basic Osha\nprotections are not being followed, or implemented at all.\n\n\u201cProbably the most important to me is a general awareness of the job site,\nwhat\u2019s going on around you, and the confidence to be able to stand up and say,\n\u2018Stop, this is unsafe,\u2019\u201d said Anton Ruesing, executive director of the\nInternational Finishing Trades Institute. \u201cA lot of workers don\u2019t feel\ncomfortable enough to say, \u2018Hold on a second, that\u2019s unsafe, and I\u2019m not going\nto do that.\u2019\u201d\n\nAntonio, for example, claimed he and other workers were not given proper\nbreaks or enough water on the job, and had little recourse because if they\nspeak up, they won\u2019t be able to get work again.\n\n\u201cThese contractors mislead you and lie about the job, they lie about the pay\nand end up paying less than the amount they promised,\u201d he said. \u201cThey take\nadvantage of us and that\u2019s how they are lining their pockets, by abusing\npeople like us.\u201d\n\nWhile Osha regularly issues citations and penalties in cases where a worker is\nkilled on the job and safety protocols were not followed or implemented, its\nfines have been criticized as being too low to deter bad behavior by\nemployers.\n\nLegislation to modernize the federal agency in charge of protecting workers,\nincluding the expansion of its coverage to 24 states not currently covered,\nhas stalled in Congress.\n\n\u201cWorkers die and get injured when management basically fails to provide a safe\nworkplace,\u201d said Jessica Martinez, co-executive director of the National\nCouncil for Occupational Safety and Health. \u201cDoing a job safely in\nconstruction and other industries requires time, money, management, attention\nand other resources. So when management decides not to spend that time, money\nand attention, then workers end up paying the price.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way, but we still have a ways to go,\u201d said Ruesing. \u201cThe\nfact that deaths and fatalities are figured into a job in terms of costs and\ninsurance, it\u2019s still disgusting.\u201d\n\nGabriel Strathern fell to his death while working on a roofing job in Raleigh,\nNorth Carolina. He was 29.\n\nOsha fined his employer on the job, the roof and window cleaning firm Squeaky\nClean, about $17,000 for failing to provide fall protection or sufficient\nsafety training.\n\nDuring separate legal proceedings, the owner of Squeaky Clean, James Crisp,\nwas asked why he had not reported Strathern\u2019s death to Osha. \u201cI didn\u2019t know\nthat I was required to,\u201d he said, according to a copy of a deposition obtained\nby the Guardian.\n\nGabriel Strathern with son in Raleigh, North Carolina. Photograph: Courtesy of\nDevin Gilgor\n\nDevin Gilgor, Strathern\u2019s father, said: \u201cA month before, Gabriel had fallen\noff a roof, but hadn\u2019t sustained any serious injuries and when he asked about\nreporting the incident to Osha, his employer told him, \u2018We don\u2019t do Osha.\u2019\n\n\u201cThey knew this house was very dangerous, because the roof pitch was at a peak\nangle and he still wasn\u2019t given any fall protection equipment.\u201d\n\nGilgor explained that he was the one who reported the incident to Osha the\nnext day, and that to this day he has never received a phone call or apology\nfrom his son\u2019s employer.\n\nThe fines paid by Squeaky Clean, and other employers found in breach of the\nrules, are not enough, according to Gilgor. \u201cWhen a death or permanent\ndisability occurs on the job, the ability of an employer to negotiate fines\nshould not be an option,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only civil but criminal charges need\nto be pursued. Avoiding workplace accidents should be our main focus.\n\n\u201cEmployers need to be made aware of Osha regulations. Employees need to be\nmade aware of their rights to a safe work environment and Osha needs to come\nup with better ways to reach the workplace.\u201d\n\nSqueaky Clean and an attorney representing Crisp did not respond to multiple\nrequests for comment.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Construction industry\n  * Workers' rights\n  * US unions\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Business\n  * Economics\n  * Banking\n  * Money\n  * Markets\n  * Project Syndicate\n  * B2B\n  * Retail\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
