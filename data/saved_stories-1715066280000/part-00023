MediaNews Group/Long Beach Press-\nTelegram via Getty Images\n\nA spokesperson for Fisker declined to comment, as did a spokesperson for\nContinental Development Corporation, which is the company that leases out the\noffice space.\n\nThe move comes as Fisker faces headwinds from a slowdown in the EV industry.\nThe carmaker has warned multiple times over the past few months that it could\nrun out of money and file for bankruptcy within the year.\n\nOn April 23, Fisker said in a regulatory filing with the Securities and\nExchange Commission that it had just $54 million in cash equivalencies as of\nApril 16 and \"believes that its available liquidity will not be sufficient to\nmeet its current obligations.\"\n\nFisker has said it's looked for additional funding or a potential buyer. In\nApril, Fisker CEO Henrik Fisker told staff that the company was in talks with\nfour different automakers regarding a potential acquisition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company has initiated a series of layoffs over the past few months and\nwarned workers on April 29 that they could be laid off and Fisker's \"facility\nwill close\" in two months if the automaker is not able to change its course.\n\nDo you work for Fisker or have a tip?
