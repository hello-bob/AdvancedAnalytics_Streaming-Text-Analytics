These effects need not actually happen for the question to resolve Yes.\nMetaculus admin discretion may be used to resolve this question in the result\nof ambiguity.\n\nIf sources report that the law or executive order could be contested in the\ncourts, the question will still resolve as Yes if, absent court challenges, it\nwould satisfy the criteria described here.\n\nIf the TikTok app can be downloaded via a technical circumvention that\nviolates the app store terms of service, this would not affect resolution of\nthe question and the question can still resolve Yes.\n\nIf US users can still access TikTok if it was previously downloaded, this\nwould not affect resolution and the question can still resolve Yes. That is,\nthe app need not be forcibly uninstalled from users devices, only that it can\nno longer be supported by both the Google Play Store and the iOS App Store.\n\nOn March 7, the House Energy and Commerce Committee unanimously advanced two\npieces legislation both on a 50-0 vote - the \"Protecting Americans\u2019 Data from\nForeign Adversaries Act of 2024\" (H.R. 7520) and the \"Protecting Americans\nfrom Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act\" (H.R. 7521). These two\nbills, if passed and sign into law, would prevent applications from being\navailable in US app stores or web hosting services when those applications are\nsubject to the control of a foreign adversary, as defined by Congress in Title\n10. This would include TikTok, currently owned by ByteDance, a Chinese\ncompany.\n\nThe bills also create a process for apps to remain on US app stores and web\nhosting services if they sever ties to entities subject to the control of a\nforeign adversary through divestment. This suggests that these laws, if\npassed, would require ByteDance to sell off TikTok or face it being banned in\nthe United States.\n\nauthor\n\nPeterWildeford\n\nOpened:Mar 8, 2024\n\nCloses:Dec 31, 2024\n\nScheduled Resolution:Jan 1, 2025\n\nEconomy & Business\n\nPolitics\n\nUnited States\n\nRepublican Party (US)\n\nByteDance\n\nTikTok\n\nApp Store (iOS)\n\nGoogle Play\n\n2024 Leaderboard\n\nEverything TikTok users need to know about a possible ban\n\nWashington Post\u2022Apr 24, 2024\n\nTikTok ban expected to become law, but it's not so simple.

Which is the problem.\nJohnson is on very shaky ground right now, and his MIRV could fall through,\nwith the discharge foreign aid (with no tik tok) getting passed - maybe.\n\n#### md\n\ncommented on Mar 17, 2024, 8:53 AM\n\nmd's Prediction\n\n40%\n\nMar 17, 2024, 8:48 AM\n\nA few observations:\n\n  1. The Senate does not seem so clearly in favor of this (https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/15/technology...).\n  2. The constitutionality of such a ban is quite questionable (https://www.cato.org/blog/could-latest-tiktok..., https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/24/opinion/ti...)\n\nAs a result, even if the Senate does pass this bill and the President signs\nit, it would likely be litigated in the courts. Given the six month deadline\nto sell and the likelihood of a pause during litigation, a ban prior to Jan 1,\n2025 seems quite unlikely to me.\n\nI rate this still as a 40% chance because ByteDance may simply decide that\nit's not worth the headache, but that, too, seems unlikely to me--it seems\nclear that the CCCP does favor retaining control over TikTok, and a forced\nsale of something as large as TikTok would be economically disadvantageous in\na short time frame.\n\n8\n\n#### skmmcj\n\nreplied on Mar 17, 2024, 11:12 AM\n\n@md From the fine print:\n\n> If sources report that the law or executive order could be contested in the\n> courts, the question will still resolve as Yes if, absent court challenges,\n> it would satisfy the criteria described here.\n\n7\n\n#### md\n\nreplied on Mar 17, 2024, 11:14 AM\n\n@skmmcj Whoops! I overlooked that. Thank you.\n\nYes, I think that raises the probability. But I still think voters here are\noverestimating the odds of the Senate passing it.\n\n(I also realize that the question was about the enactment of a law requiring\nthe sale, not the sale taking place, so my observation on the six month window\nis incorrect.)\n\nWill revise my probability upward!\n\n7\n\n#### PeterWildeford\n\nprovided an information source on Mar 13, 2024, 5:33 PM\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JakeSherman/status/176792...\n\n6\n\n#### ADQ\n\ncommented on Mar 9, 2024, 6:43 PM\n\nTrump claims TikTok ban would only help \"enemy\" Facebook\n\n5\n\n#### deKlik\n\ncommented on Mar 9, 2024, 11:37 AM\n\nIn 2020 then president Trump signed executive orders for TikTok, WeChat and\nAlipay that would have forced a sell or banned them. The order was\nincompetently drafted so it was struck down in the courts. So Biden revoked\nthe orders, and started proper process.\n\nNow there is a new Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled\nApplications Act.\n\n  1. the bill is bipartisan,\n  2. It directly names ByteDance and TikTok,\n  3. passed through the US House Energy and Commerce Committee unanimously 50-0,\n  4. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R) supports the bill,\n  5. Biden has said that he signs the bill if it passes the Congress,\n  6. Senate has not yet introduced the companion bill,\n  7. Trump no longer supports banning TikTok.\n  8. Kellyanne Conway advocating for TikTok on Capitol Hill on behalf of conservative \"Club for Growth\". Club for Growth donor Jeff Yass holds a 15 percent stake in TikTok\u2019s parent company ByteDance.\n  9. House's bipartisan bid to rein in TikTok looks set to stall in the Senate are given classified briefing from DoJ and other intelligence agencies.\n\nIt looks like the bill has time to pass before 2025.\n\nThe question is really about media reporting, so add vague question resolution\ncriteria margin.\n\nedited by deKlik on Mar 12, 2024, 4:54 AM\n\n7\n\n#### deKlik\n\nreplied on Mar 10, 2024, 11:03 AM\n\n@deKlik Added Kellyanne https://www.metaculus.com/questions/21796/us-...\n\n1\n\n#### RyanBeck\n\ncommented on Mar 8, 2024, 8:03 PM\n\nThanks @PeterWildeford, I've made a couple minor edits and set it to upcoming.\n\n2\n\nauthor\n\nPeterWildeford\n\nOpened:Mar 8, 2024\n\nCloses:Dec 31, 2024\n\nScheduled Resolution:Jan 1, 2025\n\nEconomy & Business\n\nPolitics\n\nUnited States\n\nRepublican Party (US)\n\nByteDance\n\nTikTok\n\nApp Store (iOS)\n\nGoogle Play\n\n2024 Leaderboard\n\nEverything TikTok users need to know about a possible ban\n\nWashington Post\u2022Apr 24, 2024\n\nTikTok ban expected to become law, but it's not so simple.
