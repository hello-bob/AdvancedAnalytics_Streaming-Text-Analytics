From the merchants of biblical\ntimes selling their illness-curing potions to today\u2019s offerings of synthetic\nidentity fraud, NFTs and QR Code Fraud.\n\nWhat has remained consistent over time is that fraud depends upon the skills\nof people, the skills of both the person committing fraud and the skills of\nthose tasked with investigating and preventing fraud from occurring. There is\na strong argument that one of those groups of people has harnessed the power\nof technology and advanced their skills at a faster rate than the other. Now,\na number of public sector organisations are reviewing their skills development\nstrategies to ensure that we are better equipped to counter fraud effectively.\n\n### Technology and fraud\n\nThe internet has given individuals the power to engage in illegal activities\nwithout requiring physical proximity or access to the victim. Fraud can be\nconducted against any target from anywhere in the world without the perception\nof risk that once existed when exploiting people for financial gain. The lack\nof geographical boundaries and familiarity with a country, region, or its\npeople and culture are all factors that allow fraudsters to rationalise their\nintended actions and seek out opportunities to violate positions of financial\ntrust. As technology has removed several restraints to those committing fraud,\nit is up to us as gatekeepers to ensure that we minimise the opportunities and\ndevelop our own skill sets to increase risk and reduce a fraudster\u2019s ability\nto be effective.\n\nThe 2023 Fraud Indicator, produced by Crowe UK (Crowe) and the University of\nPortsmouth\u2019s Centre for Cybercrime and Economic Crime, estimates private\nsector fraud losses to be \u00a3157.8 billion, public sector fraud losses to be\n\u00a350.2 billion, and frauds committed directly against individuals to be around\n\u00a38.3 billion, for a total of circa \u00a3219 billion. For perspective, we could\nfund another NHS for \u00a3180 billion a year.\n\n### Combatting public sector fraud is crucial\n\nCombatting fraud in the public sector is crucial for several reasons. Firstly,\nfraudulent activities drain public funds, depriving government departments of\nresources that could otherwise be allocated to essential services like\nhealthcare, education and infrastructure development. By combating fraud,\ngovernment agencies can ensure taxpayer money is used more effectively and\nefficiently.\n\nSecondly, fraud erodes public trust in government institutions and undermines\nconfidence in the integrity of public services. When members of the public\nperceive that their tax contributions are being misused or stolen, they may\nbecome disillusioned with the government and potentially disengage. By\naddressing fraud, the government can demonstrate their commitment to\ntransparency, accountability, and good governance, thereby preserving public\ntrust. This is equally relevant at national and local levels.\n\nThirdly, fraudulent activities in the public sector can have far-reaching\nconsequences beyond financial losses. For example, healthcare fraud ultimately\nmay result in substandard patient care or compromised medical services,\nendangering the health and safety of individuals. Similarly, fraud in social\nwelfare programmes may prevent vulnerable individuals from accessing the\nsupport they need. By detecting and preventing fraud, governments can mitigate\nthe potential harm inflicted on the general public and broader communities.\n\nFourthly, fraud is a criminal offence that undermines the rule of law and the\nfoundations of a democratic society. By enforcing laws against fraud and\nholding perpetrators accountable, governments uphold the principles of\njustice, fairness, and equality before the law. Additionally, prosecuting\nfraudsters deter others who may be tempted to engage in similar illegal\nactivities.\n\nLastly, fraudulent activities in the public sector can have negative\nimplications for the broader economy. For example, corruption and embezzlement\ncan distort market mechanisms, inhibit investment, and stifle economic growth.\nBy combatting fraud, governments create a more conducive environment for\nbusiness development, investment, and innovation, thereby fostering economic\nstability and prosperity.\n\n### Priorities for combating fraud in the public sector\n\nCombatting fraud in the public sector is essential for safeguarding public\nfunds, preserving public trust, preventing harm to individuals and\ncommunities, upholding the rule of law, and promoting economic stability and\ngrowth. By combatting fraud effectively, governments can ensure the efficient\nand equitable delivery of public services and uphold the principles of\naccountability, transparency, and integrity in governance.\n\nThe success (or failure) in countering fraud comes from our ability to develop\nthe required skills. From the perspective of a counter-fraud training\norganisation, the need for more effective defences against fraud in the UK\npublic sector presents both challenges and opportunities.\n\nAs fraud and its financial impact increase, the pressure to build growing\nteams of investigators also grows. This is where competing pressures impact\nour ability to maximise effectiveness. Investigators require a range of\nknowledge specific to legislation, process, and governance, and an accurate\nunderstanding of that is essential. Yet, a knowledge-based understanding of a\nsubject like fraud does not ensure an effective counter-fraud capability, as\nthat requires skills and skills that take far longer to develop than\nknowledge.\n\nThe ability to apply the processes they understand within the correct scenario\nand with the support of the right legislation is essential to build an\neffective counter-fraud capability.\n\nOur knowledge-heavy capacity-building focus, driven by a need to increase\ncapability in a quickly evolving sector, has led to a shortfall in applying\neffective and trained skills that were arguably more of a focus before\ntechnological advancements. Applying soft skills within investigations,\nemotional intelligence, enhanced communication and engagement skills are\nessential to countering fraud, yet they require time.\n\nAs a collective, we need to emphasise the pressing need for better detection\nand recovery mechanisms within UK Government departments, as well as the\nimportance of fostering partnerships and collaboration to enhance fraud\nprevention efforts, allowing for skills to be pooled and utilising cross-\nagency and sector, in the same way, that criminal groups share their own\nskills and capabilities to commit fraud more efficiently.\n\nPartnerships and collaboration are essential components of any effective anti-\nfraud strategy, and our organisation advocates for developing partnerships\nbetween government departments, non-governmental organisations, and the\nprivate sector to enhance fraud prevention efforts. By sharing information and\nbest practices, we can work together in combatting fraud and promote good\ngovernance practices.\n\n### Enhancing counter-fraud capability\n\nThe Level 4 Counter Fraud Apprenticeship offers several benefits to the public\nsector to enhance counter-fraud capability, including a specialised curriculum\ncovering fraud prevention, detection, and investigation. The apprenticeship is\nfocused on the effective development of relevant and contextualised skills\nunderpinned by knowledge, ultimately ensuring the confidence and capability of\ninvestigators to apply themselves.\n\nApprenticeships are a route now recognised across the public sector for staff\nof all ages to focus on skills-led training and application. Knowledge alone\nlimits our ability to effectively counter fraud within the public sector.\nStill, the opportunities to amplify our knowledge by developing skills and\ncollaborating with others genuinely provide one of our best opportunities to\ncounter fraud better. By investing in this apprenticeship, government\ndepartments can effectively cultivate a skilled workforce equipped to detect,\nprevent, and respond to fraudulent activities, contributing to government\nservices\u2019 overall integrity and accountability.\n\nYou can read more about Intelligencia Training and its specialist\napprenticeship training programmes at www.intelligenciatraining.com\n\nPlease Note: This is a Commercial Profile\n\nThis work is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International.\n\n  * Facebook\n\n  * Twitter\n\n  * LinkedIn\n\n  * Print\n\n#### Contributor Details\n\nNick\n\nAtkinson\n\nCommercial Director\n\nIntelligencia Training Limited\n\nPhone: +44 (0)1234 381 660\n\nnick@intelligenciatraining.com\n\nwww.intelligenciatraining.com\n\nLinkedInTwitter\n\n#### More About Stakeholder\n\n  * Intelligencia Training Limited \u2013 intelligence and counter fraud apprenticeships\n\nIntelligencia Training have been at the forefront of developing the UK\u2019s\nintelligence and counter fraud capability since 2016.\n\n#### Editor's Recommended Articles\n\n  * Must Read >> Optimising hybrid IT infrastructures in UK public sector organisations\n\n  * Must Read >> Public sector spending: The Procurement Act 2023\n\n  * Must Read >> Harnessing the benefits of solar power for the public sector\n\n  * TAGS\n  * Contributor Profile\n  * Digital Transformation\n  * Fraud\n  * OAG 043 - July 2024\n  * Public Sector\n  * SH - Intelligencia Training Limited\n\nHarriet Belderbos\n\n#### RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n### Zero Trust: How can local councils defend against the increasing cyber\nthreats?\n\n### Local authority partnerships encourage small cells delivery\n\n### Laser-based sensor promises breakthrough in 3D printing\n\n### Holodeck: Changing robotics training with infinite virtual environments\n\n### Perovskite LED display promises next-gen smart devices\n\n### MIT engineers design breakthrough flexure for muscle-powered robots\n\n### LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply\n\n#### Related Academic Articles\n\n### Algorithm \u201cDPTM\u201d for continuous authentication with behavioural biometrics\n\nMay 2, 2024\n\n### Do research software engineers have research methods?\n\nMarch 26, 2024\n\n### Tuneable phononic crystals and topological acoustics\n\nMarch 25, 2024\n\n#### Follow Open Access Government\n\nABOUT US\n\nOpen Access Government produces compelling and informative products for a wide\naudience.

Water,\nenergy, and a few essential elements are the prerequisites for cells to\nemerge. However, the exact details of how this happens remain a mystery.\n\nRecent research has focused on trying to recreate in the lab the chemical\nreactions that constitute life as we know it, in conditions plausible for\nearly Earth (around 4 billion years ago). Experiments have grown in\ncomplexity, thanks to technological progress and a better understanding of\nwhat early Earth conditions were like.\n\nHowever, far from bringing scientists together and settling the debate, the\nrise of experimental work has led to many contradictory theories. Some\nscientists think that life emerged in deep-sea hydrothermal vents, where the\nconditions provided the necessary energy. Others argue that hot springs on\nland would have provided a better setting because they are more likely to hold\norganic molecules from meteorites. These are just two possibilities which are\nbeing investigated.\n\nHere are five of the most remarkable discoveries over the last five years.\n\n## Reactions in early cells\n\nWhat energy source drove the chemical reactions at the origin of life? This is\nthe mystery that a research team in Germany has sought to unravel. The team\ndelved into the feasibility of 402 reactions known to create some of the\nessential components of life, such as nucleotides (a building block of DNA and\nRNA). They did this using some of the most common elements that could have\nbeen found on the early Earth.\n\nThese reactions, present in modern cells, are also believed to be the core\nmetabolism of LUCA, the last universal common ancestor, a single-cell,\nbacterium-like organism.\n\nFor each reaction, they calculated the changes in free energy, which\ndetermines if a reaction can go forward without other external sources of\nenergy. What is fascinating is that many of these reactions were independent\nof external influences like adenosine triphosphate, a universal source of\nenergy in living cells.\n\nThe synthesis of life\u2019s fundamental building blocks didn\u2019t need an external\nenergy boost: it was self-sustaining.\n\n## Volcanic glass\n\nLife relies on molecules to store and convey information. Scientists think\nthat RNA (ribonucleic acid) strands were precursors to DNA in fulfilling this\nrole, since their structure is more simple.\n\nThe emergence of RNA on our planet has long confused researchers. However,\nsome progress has been made recently. In 2022, a team of collaborators in the\nUS generated stable RNA strands in the lab. They did it by passing nucleotides\nthrough volcanic glass. The strands they made were long enough to store and\ntransfer information.\n\nVolcanic glass was present on the early Earth, thanks to frequent meteorite\nimpacts coupled with a high volcanic activity. The nucleotides used in the\nstudy are also believed to have been present at that time in Earth\u2019s history.\nVolcanic rocks could have facilitated the chemical reactions that assembled\nnucleotides into RNA chains.\n\n## Hydrothermal vents\n\nCarbon fixation is a process in which CO2 gains electrons. It is necessary to\nbuild the molecules that form the basis of life.\n\nAn electron donor is necessary to drive this reaction. On the early Earth, H2\ncould have been the electron donor. In 2020, a team of collaborators showed\nthat this reaction could spontaneously occur and be fuelled by environmental\nconditions similar to deep-sea alkaline hydrothermal vents in the early ocean.\nThey did this using microfluidic technology, devices that manipulate tiny\nvolumes of liquids to perform experiments by simulating alkaline vents.\n\nThis pathway is strikingly similar to how many modern bacterial and archaeal\ncells (single-cell organisms without a nucleas) operate.\n\n## The Krebs Cycle\n\nIn modern cells, carbon fixation is followed by a cascade of chemical\nreactions that assemble or break down molecules, in intricate metabolic\nnetworks that are driven by enzymes.\n\nBut scientists are still debating how metabolic reactions unfolded before the\nemergence and evolution of those enzymes. In 2019, a team from the University\nof Strasbourg in France made a breakthrough. They showed that ferrous iron, a\ntype of iron that was abundant in early Earth\u2019s crust and ocean, could drive\nnine out of 11 steps of the Krebs Cycle. The Krebs Cycle is a biological\npathway present in many living cells.\n\nHere, ferrous iron acted as the electron donor for carbon fixation, which\ndrove the cascade of reactions. The reactions produced all five of the\nuniversal metabolic precursors \u2013 five molecules that are fundamental across\nvarious metabolic pathways in all living organisms.\n\n## Building blocks of ancient cell membranes\n\nUnderstanding the formation of life\u2019s building blocks and their intricate\nreactions is a big step forward in comprehending the emergence of life.\n\nHowever, whether they unfolded in hot springs on land or in the deep sea,\nthese reactions would not have gone far without a cell membrane. Cell\nmembranes play an active role in the biochemistry of a primitive cell and its\nconnection with the environment.\n\nModern cell membranes are mostly composed of compounds called phospholipids,\nwhich contain a hydrophilic head and two hydrophobic tails. They are\nstructured in bilayers, with the hydrophilic heads pointing outward and the\nhydrophobic tails pointing inward.\n\nResearch has shown that some components of phospholipids, such as the fatty\nacids that constitute the tails, can self-assemble into those bilayer\nmembranes in a range of environmental conditions. But were these fatty acids\npresent on the early Earth? Recent research from Newcastle University, UK\ngives an interesting answer. Researchers recreated the spontaneous formation\nof these molecules by combining H2-rich fluids, likely present in ancient\nalkaline hydrothermal vents, with CO2-rich water resembling the early ocean.\n\nThis breakthrough aligns with the hypothesis that stable fatty acid membranes\ncould have originated in alkaline hydrothermal vents, potentially progressing\ninto living cells. The authors speculated that similar chemical reactions\nmight unfold in the subsurface oceans of icy moons, which are thought to have\nhydrothermal vents similar to terrestrial ones.\n\nEach of these discoveries adds a new piece to the puzzle of the origin of\nlife. Regardless of which ones are proved correct, contrasting theories are\nfuelling the search for answers.
