It's part of a wave of ideas Japanese booksellers are trying to compete with online spaces. | TAIDGH BARRON\n\nBy Alex K.T. Martin Staff writer\n\nSHARE\n\nTwitter Facebook LinkedIn Email Print\n\nApr 22, 2024\n\nRight outside the north exit of Chofu Station in western Tokyo is Shinko\nSyoten, a brick-and-mortar bookstore that Hideharu Yahata\u2019s father-in-law\nopened in 1968 \u2014 back when Japan was on one of the most rapid economic growth\ntrajectories the world has ever seen.\n\nA spate of major magazines were founded during the 1960s including Josei\nSeven, Shukan Post, Weekly Playboy and the Weekly Shonen Jump, a manga\nanthology that has since become the best-selling comic magazine in history.\nWriters like Seicho Matsumoto and Sohachi Yamaoka were churning out\nblockbuster novels while how-to-books on improving everything from English\nlanguage skills to sex lives sold in the millions.\n\nBy the time Yahata left his job as an engineer at a manufacturing firm and\nbegan working at his family\u2019s bookstore in 2002, however, the golden age for\nbooksellers seemed to be over. Japan was mired in a prolonged period of\neconomic stagnation following the burst of the asset price bubble in the early\n1990s, and while there were still plenty of bookshops in Chofu, things soon\ntook a downward turn with the emergence of new technology.\n\nIn a time of both misinformation and too much information, quality journalism\nis more crucial than ever.
