A Face Scan May Be Required\n\nWith the rise of self-guided tours, many companies are requiring facial\nrecognition to see a property By Malena Carollo\n\nApril 17, 2024 08:00 ET\n\nGabriel Hongsdusit\n\n### Share This Article\n\nCopy Link Copied!

There\u2019s the hair-pulling task of\npacking up and schlepping to a new location\u2014but before you even get to that\nyou must overcome a shortage of places to live and figure out how to afford\nrents that have shot to nearly 30 percent above pre-pandemic levels. On top of\nthose challenges, many landlords are now asking renters to submit to \u201clive\nselfies\u201d\u2014wrap-around 3D facial recognition scans to verify their identity.\n\nMany property owners first turned to face scans during the pandemic to take\nsome risk out of allowing self-guided tours. Now, they\u2019re sticking with it to\nhelp lower rental application fraud and save time, since employees don\u2019t have\nto handle visits. Gone are time-consuming phone calls, emails, and guided\nwalkthroughs; in are the face scans and related technologies like smart\nlockboxes and scheduling software.\n\n## Report Deeply and Fix Things\n\nBecause it turns out moving fast and breaking things broke some super\nimportant things.\n\nGive Now\n\nAnd it may be where you\u2019re looking to move. Major players in this space offer\nlistings, particularly single-family homes, from Los Angeles to Atlanta,\nthough most don\u2019t include New York City.\n\nIndividual renters near the end of a wearying search for a home may not think\ntwice about a \u201cselfie check.\u201d But renters are already being inaccurately\ndenied access to housing because of bad facial recognition in tenant screening\nprocesses, and consumer advocates worry that scans of people\u2019s faces, which is\nbiometric data, will be improperly shared, sold, stored, or used to exclude\nrenters who can\u2019t use them.\n\n\u201cDo they really need a 3D scan of your face to see an apartment?\u201d said Jay\nStanley, senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s (ACLU)\nSpeech, Privacy, and Technology Project. \u201cAt what point does the burden being\nshifted onto people fail to justify the marginal decrease in risk the\ncompany\u2019s going for?\u201d\n\n\u21a9\ufe0e link\n\n## How It Works\n\nI\u2019ve had my own experience with these scans. For an upcoming interstate move,\nmy fiance and I found 16 potential rental properties we wanted to see. We\nhaven\u2019t looked for a new rental since the pandemic, and we were surprised that\nwe\u2019d be touring most of the rentals alone. For 12 of them, at least one of us\nalso had to complete a facial scan. We felt like listings were quickly\nbecoming unavailable, so we complied.\n\n> My fiance and I found 16 potential rental properties we wanted to see. For\n> 12 of them, at least one of us also had to complete a facial scan.\n\nFacial recognition often comes in at one of two stages in the rental process,\ndepending on the specific technology in use. Several rental platforms, like\nRently and Invitation Homes, ask for face scans up front. Renters upload a\nphoto of their government ID, such as a driver\u2019s license, and then enable\ntheir phone\u2019s front camera as the software guides them through turning their\nhead to the left and right.\n\nBut in other circumstances renters may not have to scan their face until they\nare in front of the property they wish to visit. Some landlords also use\nfacial recognition incorporated into smart lockboxes. And some platforms, such\nas Rently, require both\u2013scans ahead of time and just before entering the\nproperty.\n\nNone of the rental platforms The Markup reviewed allow renters to opt out of\nfacial recognition if they want to go on a self-guided tour.\n\nRently tells landlords its tech is a way to combat fraud, which it says \u201cleads\nto reputational damage and revenue loss. It\u2019s important to catch fraudsters\nearly, before you have to pay the price for it. With Rently, your company is\nable to utilize built-in fraud detection technology right from the start.\u201d\nRently provides some examples of the types of fraud it says it helps fight,\nlike scammers who steal appliances from properties or who pretend to be the\nlandlord and give their own tours to victims who later send them money to\nsecure the rental.\n\nFor legitimate renters, the verification process happens within seconds\u2013or at\nleast it\u2019s supposed to. But the ACLU\u2019s Stanley noted that facial recognition\nsystems are notoriously poor when the person being scanned has a darker skin\ntone, which may make people of color more likely to be flagged for a false\nnegative\u2014and therefore refused entry to a rental. Facial recognition has a\npattern of incorrectly flagging Black men and difficulty correctly identifying\nBlack women, for example.\n\n\u201c[We\u2019ve seen] cases where someone has been mixed up, for instance, with a sex\noffender\u201d by an errant facial recognition match for tenant screening, said\nMark Mailman, managing shareholder of consumer-focused law firm Franics\nMailman Soumilas.\n\n> \u201c[We\u2019ve seen] cases where someone has been mixed up, for instance, with a\n> sex offender.\u201d\n\nThe facial recognition these companies perform is typically a one-to-one\ncomparison, checking someone\u2019s face against an image you provide (here, your\ngovernment ID) to see if they match. This differs from facial recognition\nperformed by companies such as Clearview AI, which try to match a face against\na database of photos.\n\nKevin Young, spokesperson for Plaid, said in an emailed response that the\ncompany\u2019s facial recognition helps the company differentiate if someone is \u201ca\n\u2018real\u2019 person versus someone trying to hold up a printed picture that moves to\nmake it look real.\u201d\n\nIn a combined statement from Onfido and rental management company Mynd, Paul\nJarratt, vice president of marketing communications for Onfido, said that only\n\u201cpass/fail\u201d results are shared with Mynd, and Onfido \u201conly shares data\nfollowing a binding court order or law enforcement request and with the\norganization requiring the checks (in this case, Mynd).\u201d\n\nJarratt said on behalf of Mynd that identity verification ahead of viewing a\nhome is \u201cstandard practice in the real estate industry to prevent fraud.\u201d\n\n\u201cMynd has a responsibility to their investors to verify that the person\nlooking to access a home is who they claim to be,\u201d he said.\n\nNone of the other companies contacted for this story returned The Markup\u2019s\nrequests for interviews.\n\n\u21a9\ufe0e link\n\n## Following the Data\n\nFor renters concerned about handing over their biometrics, it\u2019s not always\neasy to readily identify listings requiring facial recognition\u2014and when\nrenters scan themselves, it\u2019s difficult to know who is collecting scans of\ntheir face.\n\nRenters may start their search on popular home listing sites such as Zillow,\nwhere those interested in a property can \u201crequest a tour\u201d through the site\u2019s\nmessaging feature. They are often directed to a separate site to book the tour\ndepending on which company manages the property, and the tour sites are where\nthey are prompted for facial recognition.\n\nHello World\n\n### Face Scanning and the Freedom to \u201cBe Stupid In Public\u201d: A Conversation\nwith Kashmir Hill\n\nThe longtime privacy journalist on how investigating Clearview AI helped her\nappreciate facial recognition\u2014and envision a chaotic future\n\nOctober 21, 2023 08:00 ET\n\nEven then, they may need to look at the fine print of the consent box to know\nwhich firm is handling their biometrics. Identity verification is a burgeoning\nspace whose players range from relatively new identification verification\nstartups like Persona (started in 2018) to more established financial\ntechnology companies like Stripe (which started offering identity verification\nin 2021) and Plaid (whose offering dates to 2022). Most companies creating the\ntechnology do not cater to the rental industry but instead collect scans from\nrenters when their technology is integrated into a rental website. Rently, for\nexample, uses Plaid for its facial recognition.\n\nKnowing which company is collecting face scans matters for how that data is\nhandled after collection. One identity company, Onfido, keeps facial scans for\n360 days before deleting them and keeps photos of renters\u2019 government-issued\nIDs for three years. Its privacy policy says the company will share the data\nwith police or under a court order. Persona says it deletes data either when\nthe verification is complete or within three years of that person interacting\nwith Persona. It may share data with law enforcement or its third party\nvendors, and its policy requires that those who use its services waive their\nrights to a class action lawsuit against the company.\n\nOthers have far more permissive policies. Plaid\u2019s privacy policy says it keeps\nthe data for \u201cno longer than necessary.\u201d It may share data with its business\npartners, other companies under its corporate umbrella, law enforcement, or\nwith a company that purchases it in the event Plaid is sold. Stripe says it\nretains biometrics for one year, and those who want it deleted early can\ncontact the company via email to do so.\n\nSome renters do not have the luxury of worrying about their biometric data\nbecause they can\u2019t perform a scan in the first place. Face scans via a phone\ncamera require a smartphone, technical knowhow to operate the phone and\nnavigate the technology, and a decent internet connection. About 10 percent of\nAmericans don\u2019t have a smartphone, according to Pew Research Center, and about\n20 percent of U.S. households didn\u2019t have internet connectivity as of 2023,\naccording to the U.S. Department of Commerce.\n\nThis could result in swaths of people\u2014such as those in low- or no-connectivity\nareas, those without technical savvy such as the elderly, and those without a\nsmartphone\u2014from viewing the homes, Stanley said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to see how this can have significant implications for housing,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nYour donations power our award-winning reporting and our tools.
