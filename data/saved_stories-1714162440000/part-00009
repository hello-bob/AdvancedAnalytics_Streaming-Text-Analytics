Increasingly, the facilities\noffer communal areas, hot desking and creative studios to make them a more\npalatable extension of home.\n\nBut the Generation Rent campaign group has now warned that far from being a\nlifestyle choice that could boost wellbeing, the storage boom should be seen\nan \u201cindictment of our housing crisis\u201d.\n\n\u201cSelf-storage warehouses sprouting everywhere ... won\u2019t come close to solving\nour problems,\u201d said Ben Twomey, Generation Rent\u2019s chief executive. \u201cHomes are\nthe foundations of our lives, so a storage container might be the perfect\nmetaphor for how government inaction is leaving renters out of sight and out\nof mind.\u201d\n\nNew self-storage space equivalent to more than three Canary Wharf towers \u2013 or\nabout 6,000 two-bedroom flats \u2013 has been opened in the UK in the past year,\naccording to an industry report from the real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield.\nThe sight of storage complexes opening close to small newbuild flats is fast\nbecoming one of the darker ironies of Britain\u2019s struggle to supply enough\nhousing.\n\nThis growth in storage sites is being driven by record rises in private rents\nand increasingly cramped housing; more than 500,000 rented households in\nEngland lived in officially overcrowded homes in 2022. The average UK rent\nincreased by 9.2% in the past year, according to the latest figures from the\nOffice for National Statistics, the equivalent of an extra \u00a31,300 a year on\nthe average rent in England.\n\nOvercrowding often means children sharing bedrooms with adults, and sometimes\nbeds with one another; more family arguments; teenagers struggling to do their\nhomework; and damage to physical and mental health, a survey by the National\nHousing Federation found.\n\nA hold self-storage facility in north London. Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The\nGuardian\n\n\u201cPeople are living on top of each other and it\u2019s fundamentally unhealthy,\u201d\nsaid the founder of Hold, Frederic de Ryckman de Betz, who said he had\npreviously found homeless people trying to live in units. \u201cSeparation is very\nimportant.\u201d\n\nHold tells potential customers: \u201cThe system has let us down; leaving many of\nus feeling trapped as we get outpriced and squeezed out. It\u2019s a fact: less\nspace leads to a lower quality of life. How we feel about our personal and\nwork space is deeply connected to our wellbeing. We all need more room to\nbreathe, live, and grow.\u201d\n\nThe location of Hold\u2019s first branch, on a north London street that has been\ndescribed as the \u201cgolden mile\u201d of self-storage owing to the large number of\nnew sites, embodies that system failure. It stands on the boundary of the\nboroughs of Camden and Islington, where average monthly rents are \u00a32,672 and\n\u00a32,384 respectively, about double the UK average.\n\nA person from the Little Library stores some books at Hold in north London.\nPhotograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian\n\nOn a visit to its first branch this week, the Guardian found Vincent, a\nprofessional drummer, practising in a soundproofed tiny unit because he cannot\nplay in his flat. There was also a woman organising a charity library that had\ngrown too large to store at home.\n\nHold\u2019s approach appears to be to try to build on the decluttering movement\npioneered by Marie Kondo, who argues that tidying up possessions can \u201creset\nyour life\u201d. It is also fitting hotdesk spaces, wifi and rentable music\nstudios, as customers spend more time at the storage.\n\nRenters at other complexes have previously told the Guardian they are using\nunits as a workshop for a woodworking hobby, as a makeshift library, to run an\neBay business, as well as for the standard stashing of surplus clothes and\nfurniture. Some said they got a \u201cpunch\u201d of satisfaction from seeing all their\npossessions in one place, while others said it enabled them to \u201clive tiny\u201d \u2013\nin a van or even a car.\n\nAverage monthly rents for homes in north London, where the first Hold unit is\nlocated, are between \u00a32,672 and \u00a32,384.

It\u2019s the age-old London problem. Flats are getting smaller and\nwith interest rate inflation you can\u2019t afford a two-bed, you have to get a\none-bed, and the flip side of that is [renting] self-storage.\u201d\n\nHis report predicted \u201cmore lifestyle customers ... long-term residential\ncustomers who genuinely use their self-storage unit as their room away from\nhome, storing different items at different periods of their life\u201d.\n\nBut self-storage is not the solution to the housing crisis, said Twomey. He\ncalled on the government to \u201cbuild more homes, fund councils properly to crack\ndown on landlords profiting from overcrowded rentals, and act to slam the\nbrakes on soaring rents\u201d.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Housing\n  * Renting property\n  * Communities\n  * Real estate\n  * Property\n  * Housing market\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### UK rent rises forecast to outpace wage growth for three years\n\n8 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### UK failure to build social homes \u2018shocking\u2019, says author of 2004 report\n\n4 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### UK housing is \u2018worst value for money\u2019 of any advanced economy, says thinktank\n\n25 Mar 2024\n\n  * ### Almost 10m UK households living in \u2018cold, damp, poorly insulated homes\u2019\n\n22 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Almost a third of Tory MPs trying to weaken tenant protection bill are landlords\n\n20 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Private tenants in Scotland \u2018face big rent rises and mass evictions\u2019 from April\n\n11 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Michael Gove says no-fault evictions will be banned this year\n\n11 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Ministers\u2019 99% mortgage idea could overheat UK housing market, say experts\n\n21 Jan 2024\n\n  * ### \u2018It\u2019s so cold\u2019: leaseholders left without central heating in London block\n\n11 Jan 2024\n\n  * ### Terminally ill man faces living last days in mould-ridden London flat\n\n23 Nov 2023\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Money\n  * Property\n  * Pensions\n  * Savings\n  * Borrowing\n  * Careers\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
