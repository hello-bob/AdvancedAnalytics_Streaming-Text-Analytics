The current record is held by Sagittarius A*, which sits at the\nMilky Way\u2019s centre but could not have been formed by a star and is linked to\nthe birth of the galaxy itself.\n\nScientists say that the newly discovered object is a \u201cunicorn\u201d \u2013 and could be\njust the first of a host of black holes waiting to be found in our Milky Way.\n\nThe European Space Agency\u2019s Gaia mission, involving UCL researchers, found the\nblack hole, known as Gaia-BH3, which is 33 times the mass of our Sun.\n\nGaia-BH3 was not seen directly but inferred from the movements of what\nappeared to be a lone star now understood to be its companion.\n\nThe discovery of the bright star nearby suggests many more black holes could\nbe found in the next set of data to be released from the Milky Way-mapping\nGaia space telescope.\n\nThe next set is not scheduled to be released before the end of 2025,\nresearchers said.\n\nPasquale Panuzzo of CNRS, Observatoire de Paris, in France, who is the lead\nauthor of this finding, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a real unicorn.\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of discovery you make once in your research life.\n\n\u201cSo far, black holes this big have only ever been detected in distant\ngalaxies, by the LIGO\u2013Virgo\u2013KAGRA collaboration thanks to observations of\ngravitational waves.\u201d\n\nThe average mass of known black holes of stellar origin in our galaxy is\naround 10 times the mass of our Sun.\n\nUntil now, the weight record was held by a black hole in an X-ray binary in\nthe Cygnus constellation, which has a mass estimated to be about 20 times that\nof the Sun.\n\nDr George Seabroke, Mullard Space Science Laboratory at UCL, a member of\nGaia\u2019s black hole task force, the team that made the discovery, said: \u201cFinding\nGaia BH3 is like the moment in the film The Matrix where Neo starts to see the\nmatrix.\n\n\u201cIn our case, the matrix is our galaxy\u2019s population of dormant, stellar, black\nholes, which were hidden from us before Gaia detected them.\n\n\u201cGaia BH3 is an important clue to this population because it is the most\nmassive, stellar, black hole found in our galaxy.\n\n\u201cGaia\u2019s next data release is expected to contain many more, which should help\nus to see more of the matrix and to understand how dormant, stellar, black\nholes form.\u201d\n\nThere are currently some 50 confirmed or suspected black holes in our galaxy,\nbut theory predicts there is a hidden population of thousands or millions, due\nto the number of stars that have likely already died over the galaxy\u2019s\nlifetime.\n\nGaia-BH3\u2019s companion star, a sub-giant star, is 15 times brighter than the Sun\nand five times its radius, but slightly cooler and lighter.\n\nIts orbit, in the opposite direction from most stars of the galaxy, indicates\nit is part of a cluster of stars thought to have merged with the Milky Way\nabout eight billion years ago.\n\nAt the widest point of its orbit, the star is as far away from Gaia-BH3 as\nNeptune is from the Sun. At its closest, it is about the distance of Jupiter\nfrom the Sun.\n\nThe research, which used data from the European Southern Observatory\u2019s Very\nLarge Telescope (ESO\u2019s VLT) and other ground-based observatories, will be\npublished in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies\n\n### 1/1Astronomers find huge black hole \u2013 and it is near us\n\n### Astronomers find huge black hole \u2013 and it is near us\n\nAstronomers have discovered the most massive stellar black hole in the Milky\nWay (ESO/L Calcada)\n\n### Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference\nlater?
