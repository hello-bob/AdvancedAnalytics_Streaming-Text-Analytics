For the first time in my\nlife, I had nearly full depth perception.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I was always the one who was bad at ball sports. Not for\nlack of trying, either. I'd run after a ball to catch it, only to be off by a\nfew feet. I'd whiff when hitting a softball pitch. And I quit indoor soccer\nafter taking a third ball to the face, because I didn't realize it was coming\nstraight for me. Even with running, I'd trip, and I my bike into mailboxes\nmore times than I care to remember. I'm deeply sorry to the neighbors whose\nmailboxes I knocked over; I wasn't a vandal, I just couldn't see how close I\nwas to them.\n\nAll my life, I thought it was because I was clumsy or just bad at sports. I\nleaned into endurance athletics, because I knew that I could run and ride a\nbike, and those didn't require as much hand-eye coordination, which I was\ncrucially lacking.\n\nIn 2017, we moved to a small Pennsylvania college town, and I went through the\nusual pain of finding a new eye doctor. We picked the closest one who was\naccepting new patients, because it was convenient. It was a fortuitous choice.\nMy wife and I got appointments at the same time and went in together. She went\nfirst and had a perfectly normal eye exam. Then he started on me.\n\nHe asked me a question no eye doctor ever had before: \"Do you have trouble\ncatching a ball?\" He was able to list off a few other things I had trouble\nwith, like tracking a line of text or tripping. Then he told me that I seem to\nhave a slight lazy eye. One eye points directly at what I'm looking at, while\nthe other points slightly away from it. That interferes with depth perception,\nand the brain learns it should just ignore one of the conflicting signals. To\nconfirm this, and demonstrate it to me, he gave me a depth perception test.\n\nI donned what looked like the glasses for a 3D movie, and he placed a card in\nfront of me with nine different figures. Each figure had four dots, and one of\nthem should pop out from the others at varying depths. I got the first two\neasily, then struggled a lot with the third and basically guessed. Everything\nelse looked completely flat. My depth perception was very impaired.\n\nI really did not believe that the test worked at first, that anyone could see\nanything on those other six figures. We had my wife do it, too, and she\neffortlessly breezed through all nine levels of it. I was astonished. I\nthought I had depth perception, and I did not.\n\nAs a fix, he wrote my glasses prescription to include prism in the lenses. He\nmeasured the difference in where my eyes point, so the appropriate prism will\nthen correct it by shifting one of my eyes to point at the same spot as my\nother eye. I ordered my new glasses\u2014my wife's prescription had not changed, as\nit never does\u2014and we went home.\n\nThree weeks later, my new glasses were in. I drove myself in to pick them up,\nwhich was probably a mistake. But I couldn't anticipate the profound\nexperience and shift I was about to have.\n\nHe grinned when he presented the closed glasses case to me. \"Try them on.\" I\nopened the case nervously and put them on and then my eyes... Both eyes were\nlooking at the same place. It was bizarre, like I had truly stepped into a 3D\nmovie, but deeper and surrounding me. This is how people experience the world?\nEvery day, their whole lives? \"Anything look different?\" he asked me with a\ngrin. Holy...\n\nI paid for the glasses and left, telling myself that I am coming back to this\neye doctor as long as he's working. He gave me something I hadn't had for my\nentire life, something I never knew I was missing. On the drive home, I was a\nlittle distracted, but okay. I got home safely.\n\nOnce I was home, the rest of the workday was a write-off. I was deeply\ndistracted by the very world around me. There's this one branch on this one\ntree outside my home office window. I had never noticed it before, but now I\ncouldn't ignore it. If you don't have depth perception, it blends into the\ntree. If you do have depth perception, you can see it jutting out of the rest\nof the branches toward you.\n\nI spent half an hour covering one eye. The branch pops in. Uncovering the eye.\nThe branch pops out. Cover, pops in. Uncover, pops out. I excitedly told my\nwife and asked her to try it. No profound difference for her, because the\ndepth information is so wired in that her brain plausibly filled in what\nwasn't there and wouldn't forget the depth information the moment one eye\nclosed.\n\nThis continued for weeks, months afterwards. When we would go for walks, I got\ndistracted by street signs and trees and power lines and all these things that\nwere newly in three dimensions.\n\nThe first day I had my glasses, I was first distracted and then in a lot of\npain. I got my first migraine headache. After I got my glasses and my brain\nstarted to get the expected input from both eyes, it did give me depth\ninformation but it had to rewire to handle that. This resulted in a migraine\nfor about a day.\n\nEach pair of glasses I've gotten since then, if my prescription changes, I get\na migraine unless I take migraine medication ahead of time. Since these are\npredictably timed, I've been fortunate to be able to treat them and largely\nprevent them.\n\nThe depth information integrates into my vision in what seems to be an\natypical way. When I see something that's particularly standing out from its\nbackground, I perceive it as being closer and I also see a subtle shimmer on\nit. It's sort of like the shimmer that some video games use to mark objects\nthat you can interact with. It's like my brain decided that this extra layer\nof information has to be visually represented somewhere.\n\nSome people with lazy eyes get depth perception when they have it corrected,\nand some don't. I'm one of the fortunate ones who regained almost all depth\nperception from a pair of glasses. I can now snatch a bal lout of the air\nwithout reliably smacking it across the room instead. I trip less when\nrunning. Driving is less stressful, and even enjoyable now.\n\nGetting depth perception as an adult has been a profound experience. I didn't\nrealize I was different in any way. I thought that when people said \"depth\nperception\", they meant what I did: looking at something and consciously\nestimating how far away it is. No, most people look at something and just...\nperceive how far away it is. I've gotten to experience both. I've gotten to\nexperience a lack of a sense and the restoration of it.\n\nThis experience has been mirrored in other aspects of my life, where I thought\nhow I experience the world is typical and mirrored by everyone else. It has\nresulted in revelations about gender and neurodivergence. And it has literally\nchanged how I see the world.\n\nIf glasses aren't a truly wondrous thing, then what is?\n\nIf this post was enjoyable or useful for you, please share it!
