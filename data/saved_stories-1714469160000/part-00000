We played some music and went out for dinner.\n\nLet\u2019s look at how touchscreen technology works this week. I aim to write my\nnewsletter issues in a way one can follow them while traveling on a bus,\nhaving a coffee, waiting for food, etc. Let's jump in!\n\nTablets, Smartphones, Gaming consoles, Fitness watches, Car infotainment\nsystems, and high-end home appliances such as some refrigerators; all these 6\ngadgets have one thing in common. None of them can be used without using a\ntouch screen.\n\n## How it works: 15-second answer\n\nThe touch screen in your phone consists of an outer glass layer and a display\nwith two conductive layers in between them which form a grid of capacitors.\nWhen you touch the screen, it changes the voltage at that point (of that\ncapacitor) due to the flow of charged particles in your body (our body can\nconduct electricity). The phone detects this voltage change and responds by\nexecuting the corresponding action or button press at the location, allowing\nyou to interact with the screen.\n\n## Answer to the question I posed last week\n\nLast week, I asked why a mouse doesn\u2019t work when the table surface is super\nsmooth. You can read my last newsletter issue here for more context if you\u2019d\nlike to recall.\n\nThe surface doesn\u2019t have any valleys or ridges as it is smooth. So the images\ncollected over time will have very similar pixel values and so the algorithm\ncan\u2019t find any change in X and Y directions for it to match the image pixel\nvalues. They are already almost the same. So it is difficult for the mouse to\ndetect motion.\n\n## Shoutout!\n\nThanks to my good friend and subscriber Asha Mohana for suggesting this week\u2019s\ngadget! \ud83d\ude42\n\n## How does Touchscreen work?\n\nThere are many variations of the design, but the principles are the same all\nacross.\n\n## Basic setup\n\nFigure 1: A layer in phone with vertical columns of conductive plates(LEFT);\nHorizontal rows of conductive plates (MIDDLE); These two layers placed on one\nanother forming a grid of surfaces facing each other [with a gap] at the\nintersections (Bottom)\n\nThe phone has an outer glass layer where you physically touch the screen and a\ndisplay layer beneath it. Two additional surfaces sandwiched between them are\nwhere the magic happens. Let\u2019s see what they are and how they are mounted.\n\n  1. The first layer consists of hair-like conductive materials with plates running vertically (Figure 1, Left). Negative charges are developed on these plates by drawing current from the phone\u2019s battery.\n\n  2. The other conductive layer running horizontally (Figure 1, Middle) is placed on top of the first which then induces a positive charge on this layer.\n\n  3. Thus we have a grid of parallel surfaces facing each other with opposite charges at the intersections marked in red (Figure 1, Bottom). These are nothing but a grid of capacitors but you don\u2019t have to worry about capacitors to understand how it works. A fixed voltage exists between each of these two surfaces at the intersection nodes.\n\nNow let\u2019s see what happens when you touch the phone screen at different\npoints.\n\n## Touch screen physics\n\nThe phone continually monitors the voltage across all the intersection points\nin this grid at a high speed. These plates in a gridded formation are\ntransparent and very small that you can\u2019t see with the naked eye.\n\nOkay now take a moment to appreciate my drawing \ud83d\ude05\n\nFigure 2: Electrical charge and field modified when you touch the screen at\nthat location as your body can conduct electricity, causing a voltage drop.\n\nPhysics: Our body conducts electricity as it is comprised of approximately 70%\nof water. We carry positive and negative ions. So, when you touch the screen\nwith your finger, charged particles flow through your body and this modifies\nthe distribution of electrical charge/field at that point of contact (parallel\nplates). As a result, the voltage at that particular node (capacitor) is\ndropped.\n\nFinal steps: Your phone detects the change in the voltage as it is constantly\nmonitoring the voltage across all the nodes. Subsequently, the action or\nbutton you observed on the screen at that specific node is executed,\nresponding to your touch interaction. This is how the touch screen works!\n\n## Question of the week\n\nNow that you understand how it works, can you think of why your phone behaves\ndifferently when there is water spilled over the screen? Reply to this email\nwith your thoughts, and we\u2019ll have a discussion.\n\n## Gadget of the week\n\nFigure 3: Autonomous following-robot Gita\n\nPersonal robots: Piaggio Fast Forward is a company that developed an\nautonomous robot called Gita which can follow you wherever you go on wheels\ncarrying your items in its large cargo space (up to 40 lb). And it can avoid\nobstacles with its use of cameras and other sensors.\n\nThat's all for now folks. Thank you for reading!\n\nHave an amazing rest of the week, and take care!
