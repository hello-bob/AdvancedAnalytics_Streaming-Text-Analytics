Solar Foods is just one of a handful vying for pole\nposition in a burgeoning 'air-protein' market that's expected to be worth\nUS$100 million by 2032.\n\nThe protein, called Solein (no, not soylent green; solar-protein), is the\nbrainchild of Pasi Vainikka and bioprocesses scientist Juha-Pekka Pitk\u00e4nen,\nwho started Solar Foods on the back of this creation. Pitk\u00e4nen knew of single-\ncell soil-dwelling microbes that oxidize hydrogen for energy, and he was\ncertain they could be harvested and harnessed to produce cellular food.\n\nMore Stories\n\nEnvironment\n\nSoybean waste used to grow good \"green\" food for farmed fish\n\nSpace\n\nNearby asteroid's birthplace traced to specific crater on the Moon\n\n### We recommend\n\nPowered by\n\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Do not sell my personal information\n  * Google Analytics settings\n\nI consent to the use of Google Analytics and related cookies across the\nTrendMD network (widget, website, blog).

And Solar\nFoods is just one of the companies that see the writing on the wall and the\npotential fortune to be made in revolutionizing how we produce our food.\n\n\u201cJust like with quantum computers, it\u2019s no longer a question of will cellular\nagriculture become a thing: It\u2019s evident that it will,\" said Vainikka. \"The\nquestion is more about who leads the charge. We are exploring the\npossibilities of this scientific platform on a new scale. Factory 01\ndemonstrates it is possible to grow protein from start to finish under one\nroof, year-round even in the harsh Northern conditions of Finland \u2013 and to do\nit all sustainably and in a commercially viable manner.\u201d\n\nSolar Foods' fermentation process, with Solein still in liquid form\n\nSolar Foods\n\nFor many of us, the rising cost of groceries or price of eggs may be our main\ngripes with access to food \u2013 but we're the lucky ones. Around the world, it's\nestimated nearly 800 million people experience prolonged hunger in 2022, up\nfrom 122 million in 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, animal-based agriculture accounts for around 30% of greenhouse gas\nemissions and 70% of the planet's entire water use, as well as causing land\ndegradation, waterway pollution and intensive forest clearing. Then throw into\nthe mix zoonotic diseases \u2013 like the emerging H5N1 avian influenza threat \u2013\nand it's difficult to see how modern methods of food production will ever be\nsustainable again.\n\nEspecially given that we're currently adding around 73 million new humans to\nthe planet each year.\n\nWhich begs the question: Where the hell are we going to get enough food for\neveryone without further wreaking havoc on the planet \u2013 are we expected to\njust pull food out of thin air? Actually, yes.\n\nSolar Foods is but one of the new batch of innovative food biotech startups\nvying to stake \u2013 or, ahem, steak \u2013 a claim in this revolutionary and forward-\nthinking new market. This way of growing food out of air was actually first\nemployed in the 1970s by NASA, making edible nutrition grown from astronauts'\noxygen supplies, but it was all but forgotten about until around 15 years ago.\n(This is hardly a surprise: The 'alternative food' market in the 1970s was\njust a limited range of fake meats, and the words \"climate change\" only first\nappeared in print in 1975.)\n\nFast-forward half a century and the race is on to scale up and commercialize.\nCompeting with Solar Foods, which made its debut in Singapore last year with a\nchef-designed five-course meal that showcased Solein's versatility, is\nCalifornia's Air Protein, which also uses an undisclosed \"culture\" in its\nfermentation process. Co-founded by Lisa Dyson and John Reed, the company has\nraised more than $107 million to date, with investment from major players\nBarclays and food production giant ADM.\n\nThe company has also established a point of difference, aiming to use its\nprotein product to specifically develop alternative meats including chicken,\nscallops and fish.\n\nAir Protein is focused on developing textures and flavors for meat\nalternatives \u2013 like this Air Chicken\n\nAir Protein\n\n\u201cAir Protein is rich in vitamins, minerals, and nutrients, with all 20 amino\nacids, including the nine essential amino acids and 2x the amino acids of\nsoybeans,\" the company has stated. \"It contains more protein per [kilogram]\nand is free from GMOs, pesticides, herbicides, hormones, and antibiotics.\"\n\nIt also uses 524,000 times less land and 112,000 times less water per kilogram\nthan current meat production methods. And it's quick to make. Air Protein and\nADM inked a deal in 2023 to establish a commercial-scale production plant.\n\nSolar Foods' factory, which the company intends to expand quickly, uses a\nfifth of a hectare to produce 160 tonnes of Solein powder a year, which can\nthen be made into a variety of foods \u2013 including 'dairy' products, meat\nsubstitutes and protein-boosted staples. Much like many other forms of\nfermentation, this microbial foundation is free of any animal (and, well,\nplant) products.\n\nCould 'air protein' be the best thing since \u2013 and for \u2013 sliced bread? Time\nwill tell\n\nSolar Foods\n\nIf the issue with cell-grown laboratory meat has been as much about\nscalability challenges as public perception, there seems to be far less of a\nchallenge in microbial-protein foods. As well as being grown 'naturally',\nSolein \u2013 65-70% protein, 5-8% fat, 10-15% dietary fibers and 3-5% mineral\nnutrients \u2013 uses 100 times less water and 20 times less land than plant\nprotein production, with one-fifth of the carbon emissions.\n\n\"It can be used to replace existing proteins in a variety of foods, for\nexample in alternative dairy and meat, different snacks and beverages, noodles\nand pasta, or breads and spreads,\" Solar Foods has said. \"It is the first ever\nnovel food disconnected from the limits of traditional agriculture. This type\nof production method has the potential to transform the sustainability,\navailability, and transparency of what we eat and where food can be produced.\"\n\nAnd it can be made quickly, almost anywhere.\n\n\"It originates from a natural, unmodified, single-cell organism,\" the company\nsaid. \"It is nonetheless a completely natural protein, even though it isn\u2019t\ngrown traditionally.\"\n\nIn the Netherlands, Deep Branch has developed a single-cell protein, achieved\nthrough a process of gas fermentation, known as Proton, specifically for the\nanimal feed market. Its high-protein feed is 60% less carbon-intensive than\nexisting proteins used in commercial agriculture. Right now, 37% of cropland\nis devoted solely to feeding the animals we eat \u2013 and this percentage is\nrising. A growing demand for seafood, coupled with climate change forces and a\ndrop in available catches to produce aquafeed (around 97% of fish meal is used\nin animal feed, with nearly two-thirds of this used to sustain commercial fish\nfarms), has pushed the price up of this high-protein stock. Proton has\ncomparable nutrition, but a fraction of the surprising carbon footprint. While\none of the lesser greenhouse gas contributors in animal-based agriculture,\nfish meal production accounts for 57% of aquaculture's environmentally\ndamaging emissions.\n\n\"A single silver bullet solution will unlikely replace the traditional method\nof producing animal feed,\" the company has noted. \"However, gas fermentation\nlooks well-equipped to become one of the major players in this new space of\nalternative approaches. Fermentation concepts have been successfully developed\nfor centuries, from beers to wines and everything in between, so there is\nreliable evidence that these technologies scale well.\"\n\nAlso in the Netherlands, Farmless has more recently entered the air-food race,\nfocusing on microbes and renewable (in this case, wind) energy to develop\ncommercial products for both humans and non-human animals.\n\nFarmless was founded in 2021 by physicist and entrepreneur Adnan Oner. Its\nfirst 'air food' offering is a high-protein product to be used in place of\nmeat, dairy and eggs\n\nFarmless\n\n\"Since our feedstock is liquid and has an existing supply chain, it can be\nproduced, shipped and stored anywhere in the world,\" Farmless has stated.\n\nAnd back in California, Calysta has been quietly building its aquaculture\nFeedKind business using air fermentation since 2012. And, in 2022, the company\njoined animal nutrition giant Adisseo to build its first protein production\nplant in Saudi Arabia, under the collaborative name Calysseo. The goal is to\nhave a 100,000-tonne-capacity fermenter operational by late 2026, to scale up\nplant- and animal-free feed production. This comes after its initial\n20,000-tonne fermenter in China, dedicated to producing FeedKind for\naquaculture markets.\n\nOf course, this is just a snapshot of the startups all ramping up scale and\ninvestment. However, with Solar Foods' maiden factory now open, and Air\nProtein likely to follow suit. And, given the speedy production process \u2013\n\"grows in hours,\" according to Air Protein \u2013 going from 'ferm to table' will\ntake a fraction of the time that plant and animal agriculture requires.\n\nSolein can be made into a high-protein meat substitute \u2013 as well as the\nnoodles it's served on\n\nSolar Foods\n\n\u201cLivestock needs two years to go from 'suckling to sirloin,'\" Air Protein said\nin a statement. \"Air meat can be produced in a matter of hours, through a\nfermentation process similar to making beer or yogurt.\u201d\n\nAs to whether the world is ready to make friends with microbes and replace\ntraditional protein, this remains to be seen. But we wouldn't say no to a\nfreezer stocked full of Solein chocolate gelato courtesy of a June 2023\ncollaboration with Singapore restaurant Pico.\n\n\"Replacing dairy with Solein in this chocolate gelato, we were able to craft a\nvegan ice cream without compromising on its creaminess,\u201d said Chef Mirko\nFebbrile at the time.
