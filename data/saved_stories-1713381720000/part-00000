That\u2019s what this tutorial is all about.\n\n## What are image galleries?\n\nImage galleries are a way to display a collection of images in a visually\nappealing way. They are used to showcase a variety of images or to provide a\npreview of a product or service.\n\nUse cases:\n\n  * Product images: For example, a product gallery can be used to showcase different product images or features.\n  * Service images: A service gallery can be used to showcase different service images or features.\n  * Event images: An event gallery can be used to showcase different event images or features.\n  * Blog images: A blog gallery can be used to showcase different blog images or features.\n\nand so on and so forth. There\u2019s a lot of different use cases for image\ngalleries, and the possibilities are endless.\n\n## Let\u2019s get started by creating the structure\n\nUnderstanding the code:\n\n  * x-data=\"{ currentImage: null }\": This is the data that will be used to store the current image.\n  * x-init=\"() : This is the initialization code that will be executed when the component is first rendered.\n  * window.addEventListener('keydown', (event) : This is the event listener that will be added to the window object.\n  * if (event.key === 'Escape') : This is the condition that will be checked when the Escape key is pressed.\n  * currentImage = null;: This is the code that will be executed when the Escape key is pressed.\n  * x-on:click=\"currentImage = '/path-to-your/image.png'\": This is the event listener that will be added to the image elements.\n  * src=\"/path-to-your/image.png\": This is the where you will put the path to your image.\n  * x-on:click=\"currentImage = null\": This is the event listener that will be added to the close button.\n  * @click.away=\"currentImage = null\": This is the event listener that will be added to the close button.\n  * :src=\"currentImage\": This is the attribute that will be added to the image element.\n\nClasses are removed for brevity, but I\u2019ll keep those classes relveant to the\ntutorial.\n\n    \n    \n    <div x-data=\"{ currentImage: null }\" x-init=\"() => { window.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => { if (event.key === 'Escape') { currentImage = null; } }); }\"> <div class=\"grid grid-cols-3 gap-4\"> <div x-on:click=\"currentImage = '/path-to/image-1.png'\"> <img src=\"/path-to/image-1.png\" alt=\"Image 1\" /> </div> <div x-on:click=\"currentImage = '/path-to/image-2.png'\"> <img src=\"/path-to/image-2.png\" alt=\"Image 2\" /> </div> <div x-on:click=\"currentImage = '/path-to/image-3.png'\"> <img src=\"/path-to/image-3.png\" alt=\"Image 3\" /> </div> <!-- Add more image placeholders as needed --> </div> <!-- Modal --> <div x-show=\"currentImage\" role=\"dialog\" aria-modal=\"true\" aria-labelledby=\"modal-title\"> <div @click.away=\"currentImage = null\" tabindex=\"-1\" aria-labelledby=\"modal-title\" aria-describedby=\"modal-description\"> <button @click=\"currentImage = null\" >Close</button > <img :src=\"currentImage\" alt=\"Full Size Image\" /> </div> </div> </div> <div @click.away=\"currentImage = null\" > <img :src=\"currentImage\" /> </div> </div> </div>\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis is a simple image gallery that can be used for any type of content, such\nas products, services, or blog posts. But before using it make sure to make it\nfully accessible and responsive. You can also add more features to the\ngallery, such as zooming in and out, or adding a caption to each image, a\nbutton to go back to the previous image, to close the modal, and so on.\n\nHope you enjoyed this tutorial and have a great day!\n\n## Reviews and opinions\n\nSee them all\n\n  * \"I bought a beautiful theme from Lexington a couple weeks ago.
