Much of the Qt5/KF5 porting was done\nin 2015 already, but finishing and polishing everything up has been a slow,\nsometimes ongoing and sometimes stalled process ever since. 3.0 Alpha was\nreleased in February 2021 and has been since used by many people, as have been\nnightly builds of git master available for various distributions. Now in the\npast few months, an effort was made to get everything ready for a proper 3.0\nrelease.\n\nCommon usecases should work quite well, and in addition to fixing KF5 port\nrelated regressions reported in pre-releases, 3.0 features many bugfixes and\nimplemented features for longstanding issues, the oldest such documented being\nfrom 2009. However, with more than 20 years of development history, it is\nlikely that not every feature Amarok has been tested thoroughly in the new\nrelease, and specifically some Internet services that have changed their API\nin recent years are not available, at least for now. It might well be that\ngetting them in better state wouldn't require huge effort, however, so if you\nknow your way with Qt and KDE Frameworks and your favourite Internet music\nservice does not work with Amarok 3.0, you are extremely welcome to join in\nand help!\n\nIn the following months, minor releases containing small fixes and additions,\nbased on both newly reported and longer-standing bug reports and feature\nrequests, are to be expected. Work on porting to Amarok to Qt6/KDE Frameworks\n6 should start in the following months, the goal being to have a usable\nQt6/KF6 based beta version in 2024 still.\n\nOne should observe that due to scripting framework port from QtScript to\nQJSEngine still being a work in progress, previous Amarok 2.x scripts are\noften not compatible. The script API documentation at community wiki is also\npartially out of date. Additionally, due to incompatibilities and other\nissues, KNewStuff downloading of scripts is disabled for the time being.\nHaving script support in more polished shape is something to work on after an\ninitial Qt6/KF6 version starts to be usable. It is also evident that the web\nsite and community wiki pages largely originate from more than ten years ago,\nand contain partially outdated information. Some work on refreshing them and\npruning the documentation to make it more maintainable is likely to happen\nduring the following months.\n\n### Now it's time to Rediscover Your Music in the 2020's!\n\n#### Changes since 3.0 Beta (2.9.82)\n\n##### FEATURES:\n\n  * Added a visual hint that context view applets can be resized in edit mode.\n  * Display missing metadata errors in Wikipedia applet UI.\n  * Add a button to stop automatic Wikipedia page updating.
