Amazon is a multibillion-pound corporation, doing everything in its\npower to stop minimum wage workers from forming a union.\u201d\n\nUnder the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, it is\nunlawful for an employer to make an offer to a worker, \u201cfor the sole or main\npurpose of inducing the worker not to be or seek to become a member of an\nindependent trade union\u201d.\n\nLawyers working with the GMB believe the presence of the QR codes may\nconstitute such an offer.\n\nRosa Curling, a director of Foxglove Legal, which is involved in the case,\nsaid workers had been \u201chustled into anti-union propaganda seminars, then have\na QR code shoved in their face that terminates their membership with just one\nclick to quit. If only it was so easy to quit Amazon Prime!\u201d\n\nPaul Nowak, the general secretary of the TUC, said: \u201cGood employers recognise\nthe value of unions. But Amazon is throwing everything at trying to stop\nworkers from organising for better pay and conditions and from having an\nindependent voice at work.\n\n\u201cIts union-busting tactics should have no place in Britain, and are further\nproof of why Labour\u2019s new deal for working people is so badly needed.\u201d\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson said: \u201cOur employees have the choice of whether or not\nto join a union. They always have.\n\n\u201cWe regularly review our pay to ensure we offer competitive wages and\nbenefits. Our minimum starting pay has increased to \u00a312.30 and \u00a313 per hour\ndepending on location, that\u2019s a 20% increase over two years and 50% since\n2018. We also work hard to provide great benefits, a positive work environment\nand excellent career opportunities.\u201d\n\nThe tribunal case underlines the fraught relationship between unions and\nmanagement, as they prepare for a legally binding ballot on union recognition\nat the site.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Business Today\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and\nanalysis you need every morning\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

It is likely to take place within\nweeks.\n\nTo secure recognition, the GMB will need to win a majority of support in the\nballot. The \u201cyes\u201d voters must also represent at least 40% of the more than\n3,000 workers on site.\n\nThe GMB has been painstakingly building up its membership at the Coventry site\nand other nearby warehouses over many years.\n\nWorkers have held a series of strikes over the past year, demanding \u00a315 an\nhour and the right to negotiate with management over pay and conditions.\n\nOn Black Friday in November, they were joined on the picket line by members of\nunions representing Amazon workers in continental Europe and the US.\n\nThe multinational is well known to be sceptical about the value of working\nwith unions, and has been accused of union-busting tactics by the US labour\nregulator.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Amazon\n  * Retail industry\n  * Technology sector\n  * Trade unions\n  * Employment law\n  * Employment tribunals\n  * GMB union\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Amazon UK could be forced to recognise union as GMB wins right to hold ballot\n\n19 Apr 2024\n\n  * ### Amazon drops $1.4bn deal to buy iRobot after EU veto reports\n\n29 Jan 2024\n\n  * ### Amazon accused of using \u2018union-busting\u2019 tactics at Midlands warehouses\n\n8 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Amazon Prime Video streaming content to include \u2018limited advertisements\u2019\n\n27 Dec 2023\n\n  * ### \u2018What do we want? \u00a315!\u2019 Hundreds join Amazon picket line for Black Friday strike\n\n24 Nov 2023\n\n  * ### Amazon workers at new Birmingham site to go on strike over pay\n\n9 Jan 2024\n\n  * ### \u2018Make Amazon Pay\u2019 Black Friday strikes planned in 30 countries including UK\n\n27 Oct 2023\n\n  * ### CMA to investigate UK cloud computing market amid Microsoft and Amazon concerns\n\n5 Oct 2023\n\n  * ### Amazon and Facebook owner Meta agree to protect consumers, CMA says\n\n3 Nov 2023\n\n  * ### Amazon to invest up to $4bn in OpenAI rival Anthropic\n\n25 Sept 2023\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Business\n  * Economics\n  * Banking\n  * Money\n  * Markets\n  * Project Syndicate\n  * B2B\n  * Retail\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
