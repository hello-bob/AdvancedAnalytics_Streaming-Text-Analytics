Now he looks prophetic.\n\nBy Michal Lev-Ram\n\nApril 30, 2024\n\n  * Like\n\n  * Comment\n\n  * Share\n\n## Subscribe now\n\nGet all of our stories delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nMaybe Later\n\nIn September 2020, Brian Armstrong, the CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange\nplatform Coinbase, did something unthinkable in Silicon Valley: he said there\nwould be no politics at his company.\n\nThis was right after the summer of George Floyd and Covid lockdowns and\nmicroaggressions in the workplace\u2014when companies as conventional as Nordstrom\nand IBM were all of a sudden issuing official statements in support of the\nBlack Lives Matter movement, and established financial institutions like\nJPMorgan Chase were committing billions of dollars toward investing in\nminority-owned businesses. Even Viacom-owned Paramount Network, the cable TV\nchannel known for series like Battle of the Fittest Couple\u2014not exactly a brand\nwe look to for moral clarity\u2014felt they had to take a stand, canceling\nproduction of its long-running show Cops, as protests against incidents of\npolice brutality spread nationwide. In short, corporate statements (and\ncancellations) in the name of social justice causes became almost as\ncommonplace as having an HR department.\n\nThe pressure was intense for Coinbase to follow suit\u2014including from inside the\nhouse.\n\nIn early June, reportedly hundreds of employees had staged a virtual walkout\nto protest the fact that Armstrong hadn\u2019t moved quickly to make a public\nstatement in support of BLM, even though the CEO had sent out a companywide\nemail a week after George Floyd was killed, saying he knew many employees were\n\u201churting\u201d and that Coinbase was there to support them.\n\nArmstrong capitulated, voicing his support for BLM and apologizing to\nemployees for his handling of a meeting on the topic, at which some workers\nreportedly became upset. But, though pressured to speak out, the press-shy CEO\nstill felt that publishing a public statement in support of social causes was\nnot the right move for every company, including his.\n\nArmstrong\u2019s stance was that there was a time and place for activism, but that,\nin the future, he wanted Coinbase to be \u201claser focused\u201d on its fundamental\nmission\u2014to build a platform for users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies.\n\nThat\u2019s why, several months after the controversy, on September 27, 2020, he\npublished a blog post stating that Coinbase would no longer engage in \u201cbroader\nsocietal issues.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth reading his statement in full, but the key takeaways were plain:\n\nAt Coinbase, he said, we don\u2019t:\n\n  * Debate causes or political candidates internally that are unrelated to work\n\n  * Expect the company to represent our personal beliefs externally\n\n  * Assume negative intent, or not have each other\u2019s back\n\n  * Take on activism outside of our core mission at work\n\nThe company even went so far as to offer severance packages to the small\npercentage of employees who opted to leave because of the new policy. (Some 5\npercent of employees, or about 60 people, took them up on the offer.)\n\nIn the meantime, the reaction to Armstrong\u2019s new corporate policy was swift\nand severe. Former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo was especially fired up: \u201cMe-first\ncapitalists who think you can separate society from business are going to be\nthe first people lined up against the wall and shot in the revolution,\u201d he\nposted. (Costolo could not be reached for comment on this story.) The social\nmedia company\u2019s co-founder, and another of its former CEOs, Jack Dorsey, also\nchimed in, implying that by not acknowledging the \u201crelated societal issues\u201d\nfaced by Coinbase\u2019s customers, the company and its leader were leaving \u201cpeople\nbehind.\u201d\n\nAnother tech insider, entrepreneur Aaron White, tweeted that Armstrong\u2019s\nstatement struck him as \u201cisolationist fantasy\u201d and that by taking an\napolitical stance, the CEO was \u201ceffectively guaranteeing\u201d he would land on the\nwrong side of history on \u201cabsolutely every issue.\u201d\n\nAs Shaun Maguire\u2014who was a partner at GV, Google\u2019s investment wing, from 2016\nuntil 2019\u2014explains: \u201cThe culture of Silicon Valley when Brian did that was\ndominated by Big Tech, and if you go and look at the political donations they\nwere making, it was skewed far left. Even people in the center were afraid to\ntalk four years ago.\u201d\n\nFour years later, though, Brian Armstrong looks more prophetic than\nblasphemous.\n\nThat became crystal clear earlier this month, when pro-Palestine protesters\nbarged into two of Google\u2019s offices\u2014one in New York City and one in Sunnyvale,\nCalifornia\u2014and refused to leave until the search giant agreed to back out of a\n$1.2 billion cloud computing contract with the government of Israel. The\ncompany didn\u2019t give in to their demands. Instead, it called the police. Ten\nhours after the sit-in began, the protesters were arrested on trespassing\ncharges, and a couple of days later at least 28 staffers involved with the\nincident were fired. In a note to employees, CEO Sundar Pichai stated that\nwhile Google has a \u201cculture of vibrant, open discussion,\u201d it is also a place\nof work.\n\n\u201cThis is a business, and not a place to act in a way that disrupts coworkers\nor makes them feel unsafe, to attempt to use the company as a personal\nplatform, or to fight over disruptive issues or debate politics,\u201d Pichai said\nin the memo to staff. \u201cThis is too important a moment as a company for us to\nbe distracted.\u201d\n\nThe new policy was a striking reversal for Google, which historically has been\nbetter known for capitulating to employee demands than quelling them. Back in\n2018, for instance, Google said it would not renew a contract with the\nPentagon after several thousand employees signed a petition protesting the\ncompany\u2019s involvement with an AI project aimed at improving drone strikes.\n\nLast month, Shaun Maguire\u2014the former GV employee\u2014told The Free Press that\nworking for the company in this era was \u201clike being in an authoritarian\ncountry where only certain views and people were accepted.\u201d\n\nBut apparently, even Google\u2019s leadership has reached a breaking point.\n\n\u201cI think the reason it\u2019s less controversial now is that more people have seen\nhow activism went too far in these companies,\u201d says Armstrong.\n\nMost obviously, the release of Google\u2019s flagship AI product, Gemini, made\nheadlines earlier this year because of its extreme ideological bias. As The\nFree Press reported in March, if you asked Gemini whether Hitler or Elon Musk\nis more dangerous, \u201cthe AI chatbot says that it is \u2018complex and requires\ncareful consideration.\u2019 Ask it the same question about Obama and Hitler and it\nwill tell you the question is \u2018inappropriate and misleading.\u2019 \u201d It also\nrefused to condemn pedophilia. In the wake of this embarrassment, the market\nvalue of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, fell more than $90 billion.\n\nThere are other reasons for the shift in policy, according to Armstrong. \u201cI\nthink [Elon] Musk buying Twitter also helped shape culture to a degree people\nhaven\u2019t fully internalized yet.\u201d\n\nBut perhaps more importantly, since then we have gone, as Armstrong explains,\n\u201cfrom a zero-interest rate environment to an economic crash where most\ncompanies did layoffs, so the balance of power shifted between employees and\nleadership.\u201d Employers didn\u2019t have to bend over backward to keep talent\nanymore.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Google\u2019s atmosphere that has changed\u2014it\u2019s the entire industry.\n\u201cIt used to be all about sitting on bean bags, drinking lattes,\u201d says David\nHeinemeier Hansson, co-owner and chief technology officer of 37signals, a\nsoftware company based in Chicago. \u201cBut that whole vibe has changed.\u201d\n\n37signals is the parent company of Basecamp, the project management software\ndesigner, which was a rare early adopter of Coinbase\u2019s approach to a politics-\nfree workplace. Like Coinbase, Basecamp\u2019s decision, made in April 2021, was a\nreaction to the politically charged debates that its leaders felt were\nspinning out of control\u2014and becoming an unacceptable distraction.\n\n\u201cIt had become insufferable,\u201d says Heinemeier Hansson. \u201cIt consumed more and\nmore of the business, and there were efforts to force us to do things that\nweren\u2019t right. There were employees at the time, inside the company, who were\ninterested in running ideological background checks on customers.\u201d\n\nAnother tipping point was when a list of \u201cfunny\u201d customer names that had been\ncirculating internally for years began causing a lot of disagreement about the\ncompany\u2019s culture and how it should address diversity issues. (Basecamp hasn\u2019t\nshared specific examples from the list, but it\u2019s been reported that the\ncontroversy arose because some of them were of Asian or African origin.)\n\nJason Fried, Basecamp\u2019s CEO, says he and Heinemeier Hansson didn\u2019t create the\nlist, and that it should have never existed. \u201cI don\u2019t feel good about that\nlist,\u201d says Fried. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t talk about your customers that way.\u201d\n\nUltimately, though, what started as an unprofessional joke created lots of\nunintended rifts between employees, and of course with management, who some\nworkers felt should take a stronger stand\u2014not just against the list, but on\nbroader social issues.\n\nSo when, in April 2021, Fried introduced the new policy to Basecamp\u2019s\nstaff\u2014stating clearly, \u201cWe are not a social impact company\u201d\u2014he and Heinemeier\nHansson were berated by many for their position, which one employee labeled as\n\u201coppressive.\u201d Hours after the announcement, several employees quit their jobs.\nAnd over the next couple of weeks, about a third of the company\u2019s workers took\nseverance packages\u2014which, like Coinbase, Basecamp offered to anyone who wasn\u2019t\non board with the new rules. Some of those who stayed, like the company\u2019s head\nof human resources, Andrea LaRowe, had to contend with accusations that they\nwere working for \u201cNazis.\u201d\n\nLooking back, Heinemeier Hansson and Fried say they knew that their decision\ncould tarnish their reputations in the eyes of many in the tech industry, but\nthey didn\u2019t realize just how much it could impact other employees who stayed\nin the company. That doesn\u2019t mean that they regret the policy change. Far from\nit. Both leaders say that Basecamp has been more productive than ever in the\nensuing years. And even in the face of the backlash, they felt that they had\nstayed true to what they believe. As Heinemeier Hansson so elegantly puts it:\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of having \u2018fuck you\u2019 money if you don\u2019t ever say fuck you?\u201d\n\nWhat seemed like a great idea at the dawn of the internet\u2014that tech companies\ncould serve a bigger, better purpose in the world\u2014has become fraught and\nuntenable. Google\u2019s original motto, \u201cDon\u2019t be evil,\u201d was an admirable mantra\nfor a company building the world\u2019s biggest search engine. (It was changed to\n\u201cDo the right thing\u201d after Google went through a restructuring in 2015,\nreorganizing under Alphabet.) But as it turns out, people have very different\ndefinitions of what is evil, and what is right. And in the case of Google,\nsome of its employees seem to have put ideas like Zionism, or even capitalism,\nin that first bucket.\n\nA few years ago, those employees might have had the power to push their\nparticular agenda forward. \u201cGoogle was known for coddling its employees, and\nit took feedback from them very seriously,\u201d particularly around the time\nGoogle backed out of its contract with the Pentagon, says a former employee\nwho worked in internal communications.\n\nBack then, competition was high for tech employees. Fast-forward a few years,\nthough, and that\u2019s no longer the case. More than a quarter of a million tech\nworkers were laid off from their companies in 2023. \u201cEmployers don\u2019t have to\ntolerate that kind of behavior anymore,\u201d says the former Google employee, who\nasked to remain anonymous. \u201cThe idea of bringing your whole self to work has\nturned into bringing your professional self to work.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s exactly the shift both Coinbase and Basecamp were aiming for in the\nearly 2020s.\n\n\u201cIt was a very difficult decision for us to make in the moment, but probably\none of the best decisions we\u2019ve ever made,\u201d says Fried. \u201cTo be able to avoid\nthe continuous distraction of politics today, to be able to sidestep all of it\nnow when it\u2019s only gotten worse, is just a huge relief.\u201d\n\nBoth Fried and Heinemeier Hansson also use the word relief to describe their\nreaction to the recent developments at Google. There\u2019s a sense of vindication\ntoo\u2014at least one friend who Fried says had \u201cturned his back\u201d on them in 2021\nhas reached out to apologize in recent days.\n\n\u201cPeople have started to think back on their reaction from a few years ago,\u201d\nsays Fried. \u201cIt reentered their consciousness.\u201d\n\nAs for Coinbase\u2019s Armstrong, he\u2019s cautiously optimistic that companies can\nreturn to focusing on technology without incurring the wrath he did in 2020.\n\nBut undoing years of inertia in the other direction won\u2019t be easy: \u201cMostly I\u2019m\njust hopeful that Google turns a corner and is able to get back on track,\u201d\nsays Armstrong. \u201cI seriously doubt it will happen unless they exit a large\nnumber of employees who are pursuing their own agenda rather than the\ncompany\u2019s mission.\u201d\n\nMichal Lev-Ram is a Silicon Valley\u2013based tech journalist and editor-at-large\nat Fortune.
