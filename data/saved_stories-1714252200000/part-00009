Gene editors are complex systems\nrequiring intricate spatial and temporal interactions between multi-domain\nproteins, DNA, and RNA. Designing a functionally differentiated gene editor\nusing AI represents a major leap in the blossoming field of AI-driven\nbiological design.\n\nTo address these challenges and design novel gene editors, we trained large\nlanguage models (LLMs) on the most extensive dataset of diverse CRISPR-based\ngene editing systems gathered to date. We found that the proteins generated by\nthese models expand the diversity of virtually all naturally occurring CRISPR-\nCas families by 4.8-fold, and that we could continue rapidly increasing this\ndiversity at-will. Next, we focused on CRISPR-Cas9 systems due to their wide\nadoption, including spurring a Nobel Prize and recently receiving FDA approval\nas a novel therapeutic modality. In human cells, our computationally designed\ngene editors showed comparable or improved activity and specificity relative\nto SpCas9, an exemplar gene editor, while being more than 400 mutations\ndistant.\n\nWe hereby publicly release OpenCRISPR-1, a highly performant AI-generated gene\neditor, to facilitate broad, ethical usage across research and commercial\napplications. We aim to advance innovation and development in the gene editing\ncommunity, to bring new treatments to patients with major unmet needs.\n\n#### Preliminaries\n\nUntil now, the protein engineering community has often relied on discovery-\nbased approaches to either copy a functional protein from nature and/or\nperform iterative modifications through a process called directed evolution.\nMany of the transformative proteins in our society were found through\nserendipitous discovery; for example, insulin in dogs, Cas9 in a yogurt\nfacility, and Botox\u00ae in a food poisoning incident. Large generative protein\nlanguage models capture the underlying blueprint of what makes a natural\nprotein functional. They promise a shortcut to bypass the random process of\nevolution and move us towards intentionally designing proteins for a specific\npurpose.\n\nThe core component of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing systems is the Cas9 protein,\nwhich is an RNA-guided nuclease that can search through all 3 billion\nnucleotides in the human genome and cut it at just one specific site. This\nnuclease complexes together with a single guide RNA (sgRNA) that consists of a\nscaffold which interacts structurally with the protein, and a spacer sequence\nthat can be programmed to target any site in the genome.\n\nGiven that most Cas9 proteins are over 1000 amino acids long, the overall\ndesign space contains 20^1000 possible sequences, which is orders of magnitude\nmore than the number of atoms in the observable universe. However, because\nthese proteins must orchestrate many interactions in a precise order to\nachieve accurate cutting, even a single misplaced mutation can completely\nabolish protein function. It would take many lifetimes to explore all possible\nsequence variations experimentally, yet in a matter of hours, AI systems can\nnavigate this search space to discover functional gene editors.\n\n#### Language models generate diverse CRISPR-Cas proteins\n\nGenerative protein language models are typically pre-trained on large, diverse\ndatasets of natural protein sequences that span a wide range of functions.\nThey can generate realistic protein sequences that reflect the properties of\nnatural proteins. However, for specific applications, such as the generation\nof novel gene editors, we need to steer generation towards particular protein\nfamilies of interest.\n\nTo this end, we performed exhaustive data mining to construct, to our\nknowledge, the most extensive dataset of CRISPR systems curated to date. We\nrefer to this resource as the CRISPR-Cas Atlas. All told, we uncovered 5.1\nmillion CRISPR-Cas proteins, expanding the known natural diversity of these\nsystems by 2.7-fold overall, and 4.1-fold for Cas9 specifically.\n\nTo generate novel CRISPR-Cas proteins, we then trained a protein language\nmodel on the CRISPR-Cas Atlas. We generated 4 million sequences from this\nmodel and used bioinformatic techniques to remove degenerate sequences and\nidentify which CRISPR-Cas family each generated protein belongs to. This\nfiltered set of generated sequences represents a 4.8-fold expansion of\ndiversity compared to natural proteins found in the CRISPR-Cas Atlas. We fully\nexpect that generating more sequences would expand this diversity even\nfurther.\n\n###### Generated sequences greatly expand the diversity across CRISPR-\nassociated proteins families, as measured by the number of protein clusters.\nThe heat-map indicates how often each protein family is found in different\ntypes of CRISPR-Cas systems (e.g. Cas9 is exclusively found in Type II CRISPR-\nCas systems).\n\n#### Generated gene editors are functional in human cells\n\nWe further narrowed our focus to CRISPR-Cas9 systems and trained a protein\nlanguage model on the 238,917 Cas9 proteins in the CRISPR-Cas Atlas. Given the\nwide adoption and clinical success of SpCas9, we used our models to generate\nCas9-like proteins that are interoperable with SpCas9. In other words, they\nbind to the same parts of the genome (the PAM) and are compatible with the\nsame sgRNA; therefore, they can be used for the same applications.\n\nWe selected 48 of these generated sequences for rigorous functional\ncharacterization in human cells. Our top hit OpenCRISPR-1 had comparable\nactivity to SpCas9 at on-target sites (55.7% editing for OpenCRISPR-1 vs.\n48.3% for SpCas9), but strikingly had a 95% reduction in editing at off-target\nsites (0.32% editing for OpenCRISPR-1 vs. 6.1% for SpCas9). Moreover,\nOpenCRISPR-1 is a highly novel protein: it is 403 mutations away from SpCas9\nand 182 mutations away from any natural protein in the CRISPR-Cas Atlas.\n\n###### Multiple generated nucleases (green), including OpenCRISPR-1 (dark\ngreen), have comparable or higher on-target activity to SpCas9 (blue), but\nmuch lower off-target activity.\n\nNext, we showed that when paired with a deaminase, both OpenCRISPR-1 and\nSpCas9 had similar activity and specificity when precisely editing a single\nbase in a target genome. Moreover, we were able to maintain base editing\nactivity while improving specificity by using deaminases generated by another\nProfluent-trained protein language model.\n\n###### OpenCRISPR-1 functions very similarly to SpCas9 when used for base\nediting with ABE8.20, a highly active engineered deaminase, as well as our\ngenerated deaminases PF-DEAM-1 and PF-DEAM-2.\n\nFinally, to further optimize the activity of our generated nucleases, we also\ntrained a model to generate a compatible sgRNA for any given Cas9-like\nprotein. Compared to SpCas9\u2019s sgRNA, we found that these generated sgRNAs\ncould improve the activity of generated nucleases for four of the five of the\nproteins tested.\n\n###### For 4 of the 5 generated nucleases tested, using a model-generated\nsgRNA improved editing efficiency.\n\n#### Discussion\n\nWe demonstrate the world\u2019s first successful editing of the human genome using\na gene editing system where every component is fully designed by AI. Our most\nperformant AI-generated editor, OpenCRISPR-1, achieves similar activity and\nhigher specificity than SpCas9, an exemplar gene editor, while being highly\ndissimilar in sequence. Moreover, our platform is capable of generating many\nmore gene editing systems at-will; OpenCRISPR-1 is just the tip of the\niceberg. We publicly release OpenCRISPR-1 to facilitate broad, ethical usage\nacross research and commercial applications. In making this molecule available\nto the broader community, we hope to lower the costs and barrier to entry for\ntherapeutic, agricultural, and scientific applications of CRISPR-based\ntechnologies.\n\nBack to Top\n\n", "frontpage": false}
