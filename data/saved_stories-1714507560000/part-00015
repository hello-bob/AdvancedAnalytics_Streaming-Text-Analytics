For centuries, scientists have tracked the dark\nspots dappling its radiant face, while in recent decades, telescopes in space\nand on Earth have scrutinized sunbeams in wavelengths spanning the\nelectromagnetic spectrum. Experiments have also sniffed the sun\u2019s atmosphere,\ncaptured puffs of the solar wind, collected solar neutrinos and high-energy\nparticles, and mapped our star\u2019s magnetic field \u2014 or tried to, since we have\nyet to really observe the polar regions that are key to learning about the\nsun\u2019s inner magnetic structure.\n\nFor all that scrutiny, however, one crucial question remained embarrassingly\nunsolved. At its surface, the sun is a toasty 6,000 degrees Celsius. But the\nouter layers of its atmosphere, called the corona, can be a blistering \u2014 and\nperplexing \u2014 1 million degrees hotter.\n\nYou can see that searing sheath of gas during a total solar eclipse, as\nhappened on April 8 above a swath of North America. If you were in the path of\ntotality, you could see the corona as a glowing halo around the moon-shadowed\nsun.\n\n## Quantized Columns\n\nA regular column in which top researchers explore the process of discovery.\nThis month\u2019s columnist, Thomas H. Zurbuchen, is an experimental astrophysicist\nwho was the longest continually serving head of science at NASA, a post he\nheld from 2016 to 2022.\n\nSee all Quantized Columns\n\nThis year, that halo looked different than the one that appeared during the\nlast North American eclipse, in 2017. Not only is the sun more active now, but\nyou were looking at a structure that we \u2014 the scientists who study our home\nstar \u2014 have finally come to understand. Observing the sun from afar wasn\u2019t\ngood enough for us to grasp what heats the corona. To solve this and other\nmysteries, we needed a sun-grazing space probe.\n\nThat spacecraft \u2014 NASA\u2019s Parker Solar Probe \u2014 launched in 2018. As it loops\naround the sun, dipping in and out of the solar corona, it has collected data\nthat shows us how small-scale magnetic activity within the solar atmosphere\nmakes the solar corona almost inconceivably hot.\n\n## From Surface to Sheath\n\nTo begin to understand that roasting corona, we need to consider magnetic\nfields.\n\nThe sun\u2019s magnetic engine, called the solar dynamo, lies about 200,000\nkilometers beneath the sun\u2019s surface. As it churns, that engine drives solar\nactivity, which waxes and wanes over periods of roughly 11 years. When the sun\nis more active, solar flares, sunspots and outbursts increase in intensity and\nfrequency (as is happening now, near solar maximum).\n\nAt the sun\u2019s surface, magnetic fields accumulate at the boundaries of churning\nconvective cells, known as supergranules, which look like bubbles in a pan of\nboiling oil on the stove. The constantly boiling solar surface concentrates\nand strengthens those magnetic fields at the cells\u2019 edges. Those amplified\nfields then launch transient jets and nanoflares as they interact with solar\nplasma.\n\nShare this article\n\nCopied!\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\nThese churning convective cells on the sun\u2019s surface, each approximately the\nsize of the state of Texas, are closely connected to the magnetic activity\nthat heats the sun\u2019s corona.\n\nNSO/NSF/AURA\n\n## Introduction\n\nMagnetic fields can also erupt through the sun\u2019s surface and produce larger-\nscale phenomena. In regions where the field is strong, you see dark sunspots\nand giant magnetic loops. In most places, especially in the lower solar corona\nand near sunspots, these magnetic arcs are \u201cclosed,\u201d with both ends attached\nto the sun. These closed loops come in various sizes \u2014 from minuscule ones to\nthe dramatic, blazing arcs seen during eclipses.\n\nIn other places, such loops are torn open. The sun\u2019s searing corona is the\nsource of a supersonic solar wind \u2014 streams of charged particles that form a\nmassive protective bubble around the solar system called the heliosphere,\nwhich extends far beyond the known planets. These particles carry magnetic\nfields with them, sometimes all the way into deep space. When that happens,\nthe magnetic loop stretches to the edge of the heliosphere, forming what\u2019s\ncalled an \u201copen\u201d magnetic field.\n\nWe knew that somehow these magnetic processes must be working together to heat\nthe corona \u2014 but how?\n\nOver the years, scientists proposed many explanations for the super hot\ncorona. Some of these treated the solar atmosphere as a fluid, explaining heat\ntransfer as it would occur in a fluid \u2014 through messy, turbulent cascades that\ncarry heat from large reservoirs into smaller pockets. Others suggested that\nmagnetic waves originating at the sun\u2019s surface are constantly wiggling and\ndumping heat into the atmosphere, or that, at the level of particles, some\nsort of kinetic instability is at work.\n\nIn 1988, Eugene Parker, a University of Chicago astrophysicist, argued that\nconvection at the solar surface \u2014 those churning cells \u2014 could tangle magnetic\nfields that stretched into the corona, thereby building up and storing\nmagnetic energy in the solar atmosphere. When those field lines inevitably\nsnapped and reconnected, he said, the stored magnetic energy would be\ntransferred into the solar atmosphere. There, the energy would heat the\natmosphere to high temperatures, leading to nanoflares. (Parker was also\nresponsible for a hypothesis from 1958 suggesting that the superheated corona\nis the source of the solar wind. Though widely ridiculed at the time, Parker\u2019s\nidea was correct and foundational to the field of heliophysics.)\n\nParker\u2019s idea made sense, but we didn\u2019t have sufficient data to verify or\nfalsify any of the explanations, including his. The ways in which we were\nstudying the sun just weren\u2019t up to the challenge.\n\n## A New Hope\n\nThe turning point came in 2005, when hundreds of solar scientists met in\nWhistler, British Columbia. I was the meeting\u2019s chair, a role I deliberately\nassumed in an attempt to integrate the often disjointed approaches of the\ncommunities studying the sun and the solar wind.\n\nUntil then, the solar community had mostly focused on remote observations of\nthe sun, made by ground-based telescopes, rockets or satellites such as SOHO,\na mission led by the European Space Agency (ESA) that had recently been\nlaunched and is still operating. The solar-wind community, on the other hand,\nwas busy collecting and analyzing samples of the extended corona using\nsatellites such as NASA\u2019s Advanced Composition Explorer and Ulysses, a joint\nESA/NASA mission that flew over the sun\u2019s poles. Our goal for this conference\nwas to merge the often siloed results from these new observatories and see if\nthat might help solve the mystery of the hot corona and how it accelerated the\nsolar wind.\n\nEugene Parker, seen here in 1977, made predictions about the sun\u2019s magnetic\nfield, corona and solar wind that proved foundational to the field of\nheliophysics.\n\nHanna Holborn Gray Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago\nLibrary\n\n## Introduction\n\nAt this point, we knew that solar magnetism was behaving in ways we weren\u2019t\nexpecting. SOHO data had revealed that globally, the solar magnetic field was\nfar more variable than we had imagined. And the particles comprising the solar\nwind, as measured near Earth, had peculiar compositional patterns that didn\u2019t\nmake sense if the wind was emanating directly from the sun\u2019s surface, as had\nbeen predicted. It seemed that some kind of magnetic activity in the solar\natmosphere was producing that wind \u2014 and the corona\u2019s heat \u2014 but we didn\u2019t\nhave the models to explain how it worked.\n\nThe discussions in the meeting were long and intense, but they laid the\nfoundation for a key decision: There was an absolute need to make observations\ncloser to the sun with a mission notionally called Solar Probe. A model of\nthat spacecraft \u2014 a probe that could withstand the harshness of the near-solar\nenvironment \u2014 was at the front of the meeting room, and after four decades of\nthinking about it, we were going to make it a reality. In 2017, shortly after\nI joined NASA as the head of science, the agency renamed the mission after\nEugene Parker, based on my recommendation. It was now Parker Solar Probe.\n\n## Touching the Sun\n\nEugene Parker watched as Parker Solar Probe launched from Cape Canaveral in\n2018 and rumbled into the sky atop a Delta IV Heavy rocket. After the liftoff\nhe thanked me for the honor of having his name on this spacecraft and added,\nin a rare moment of directness, that he only wished some of those bastards \u2014\ncolleagues who\u2019d derided his ideas and almost cost him his career \u2014 were still\nalive to see this.\n\nThe spacecraft used Venus flybys to sling itself successively closer to the\nsun, and on April 28, 2021, it touched the corona for the first time. It was\nnow the closest spacecraft to our star and the fastest human-made object ever\nlaunched. (In fact, last month it passed by the sun for the 18th time at a\nspeed that would get you from Washington, D.C., to Los Angeles in about 20\nseconds, and from the Earth to the moon in 36 minutes.)\n\nAs hoped, the spacecraft\u2019s near-sun observations were groundbreaking for our\nunderstanding of coronal heating. The observations solved the issue by\ndecoding magnetic signatures in the extremely near-sun solar wind \u2014 a key to\nlearning how the coronal furnace works.\n\nFrom near Earth, the solar wind looks like a turbulent fluid that is loosely\nrelated to the sun at only the largest scales. But from up close, its\nstructure directly reflects the structures on the solar surface. Instead of\nbeing a disorganized fluid, the near-sun solar plasma whooshes outward in\nstreamlets that often match the sizes of the convective supergranules on the\nsun\u2019s surface \u2014 the cells around which magnetic fields concentrate, amplify\nand escape into the corona.\n\n## Related:\n\n  1. ### Tiny Jets on the Sun Power the Colossal Solar Wind\n\n  2. ### How Scientists Are Tackling the Tricky Task of Solar Cycle Prediction\n\n  3. ### The Tiny Physics Behind Immense Cosmic Eruptions\n\nDuring each solar orbit, the spacecraft zoomed through those streamlets, and\nit found a telltale fingerprint of magnetic activity that permeated the plasma\nand pointed to a source for the corona\u2019s heat. Called \u201cswitchbacks,\u201d these\nfingerprints were S-shaped structures formed by brief reversals in the locally\nmeasured magnetic field. Such switchbacks form (at least, according to most\nscientists) when closed magnetic loops collide with open magnetic loops and\nconnect with them, during what\u2019s known as an interchange reconnection event.\nAs with good champagne in a bottle, the only way to release energy and plasma\nfrom a tangled, closed magnetic loop is to uncork it by breaking it open and\nreconnecting it with an open field line. These reconnection events generate\nheat and sling solar material into space \u2014 thus warming the corona and\naccelerating particles in the solar wind.\n\nAlthough some scientists aren\u2019t completely convinced the problem is solved,\nthe field is now converging on the conclusion that Parker\u2019s 1988 explanation\nwas right. Coronal heating ultimately depends on magnetic fields at small\nscales. Convective granules on the solar surface concentrate magnetic fields\nat their edges and unleash a chain of events that, through subsequent magnetic\ninteractions in the atmosphere, leads to the supersonic solar wind and the\nmillion-degree temperatures we see.\n\nLater this year, Parker Solar Probe will break its own record and fly even\ncloser to the sun. Another trip to hell and back, in search of more answers to\noutstanding solar mysteries.\n\nBy Thomas Zurbuchen\n\nContributing Columnist\n\nApril 29, 2024\n\nView PDF/Print Mode\n\nastrophysicsphysicsQuantized Columnssolar physicsAll topics\n\nShare this article\n\nCopied!\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\nThe Quanta Newsletter\n\nGet highlights of the most important news delivered to your email inbox\n\nRecent newsletters\n\n## Also in Physics\n\nfundamental physics\n\n### AI Starts to Sift Through String Theory\u2019s Near-Endless Possibilities\n\nBy Charlie Wood\n\nApril 23, 2024\n\nRead Later\n\nfundamental physics\n\n### Hopes of Big Bang Discoveries Ride on a Future Spacecraft\n\nBy Elise Cutts\n\nApril 17, 2024\n\nRead Later\n\ngeometry\n\n### Geometers Engineer New Tools to Wrangle Spacecraft Orbits\n\nBy Leila Sloman\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\nRead Later\n\n## Comment on this article\n\nQuanta Magazine moderates comments to facilitate an informed, substantive,\ncivil conversation.
