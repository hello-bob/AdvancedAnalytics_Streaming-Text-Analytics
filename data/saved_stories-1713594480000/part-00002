It appears to be written by Scott Adams himself. The article\nbegins on page 192 of that issue of the magazine. ^[1]\n\n### A Short History\n\nTime flies. The copyright date on my game, Pirate's Adventure, reads 1978. It\nseems like yesterday, but it has been two and a half years since I started on\nmy Adventures . . .\n\nAt the time I was working as a systems programmer for Stromberg Carlson when I\nwas first introduced to the classic Adventure game written by Crowther and\nWoods to run on a DEC (Digital Equipment Corporation) PDP-10. After playing\nfor only a few minutes I was hooked. It took almost ten days of early-morning\nand late-evening sessions before I achieved the coveted score of 350 and the\ntitle of Grand Master. I had done it--I was a bona fide adventurer! Yet it\nseemed unfair that such a fascinating game was restricted to such an expensive\nmachine.\n\nScott Adams programming at his computer\n\nBack then, I had just gotten my Radio Shack TRS-80 Level II computer, and\n(having recently finished my backgammon program) I was looking for another\ngood game to write. The concept of character strings intrigued me, and I\nwanted a game that used them. (Up to that point, I had programmed primarily in\nFORTRAN and assembly language, neither of which can handle strings easily.)\n\nAdventure seemed to fit my needs exactly. But I didn't want to copy someone\nelse's program, and I was afraid I wouldn't get much of an Adventure in a 16\nK-byte BASIC computer-especially when the FORTRAN version I played took about\n300 K bytes!\n\nI mentioned the idea of getting some sort of Adventure into my small machine\nto friends; fortunately, I was not daunted by their laughter. After all, I\ncould remember when it was supposedly impossible to get a BASIC interpreter to\nrun on an 8080 microprocessor!\n\nInterpreter? Did I say interpreter? Suddenly the idea fell into place! I had\nwritten many compilers and operating systems. Why not write an Adventure\ninterpreter? This would allow me to write many Adventures and would also\nprovide the compression I needed to fit them into a small machine. (Inside,\nI'm really a frustrated science-fiction writer; I have over 3000 science-\nfiction books in my collection but have never tried to write one myself.)\n\nSo, weeks later, my initial scribblings had evolved into a working interpreter\nwith a skeleton Adventure to play on it. It took some six months of play-\ntesting before my first Adventure, Adventureland, was finally released through\nThe Software Exchange of Milford, New Hampshire, and Creative Computing\nSoftware. Thus the Scott Adams Adventure Series was born.\n\nAnd, at that same moment, it almost died. For six months I had been so\nengrossed in programming Adventure that my wife Alexis (who at the time was\npregnant with Maegen, our daughter) started hiding my floppy disks around the\nhouse to get my attention. Once she hid them in the oven-boy, did she get some\nattention that time! I then decided that one Adventure was enough.\n\nSome time after that, Alexis unexpectedly announced that she wanted to write\nan Adventure, and it was this effort that led to the Scott Adams Adventure\ngiven in listings 1 and 2, Pirate's Adventure. With her basic ideas, we\ncreated an Adventure that was different from any that had ever been written\nbefore. Instead of simply searching for treasures in this Adventure, you now\nhad an added ingredient-a \"mission.\" (In this case, you had to figure out how\nto build a pirate's ship!) This set the stage for many of my later mission-\noriented Adventures that replace a cumulative score with a do-or-die\nsituation. These include my Mission Impossible, The Count, Voodoo Castle, and\nMystery Fun House Adventures.\n\nAll my current Adventures, for the Apple II, the Radio Shack TRS-80, and the\nExidy Sorcerer, are written in machine language and run much faster and\ncleaner than the original BASIC versions (of which there were only two and a\nhalf). I probably would never have written these programs in machine language\nif it had not been for the gentle nudges I received from a friend I've never\nmet but greatly respect, Lance Micklus.\n\n### Program Notes\n\nPirate's Adventure was first sold commercially to run in Level II BASIC on a\n16 K-byte TRS-80. Both the Adventure-interpreter program (in BASIC) and a data\nfile created by the Adventure-editor program were on the cassette tape. After\nyou loaded the interpreter program, you used it to read the data file, an\noperation that took 20 minutes but allowed me to compress a lot of Adventure\ninto very little memory space.\n\nScott Adams with Newer Products\n\nIn planning this article, I had to devise a means of creating the tape data\nfile without using the Adventure editor. The BASIC program in listing 1\nprovides the means. This program, which runs on a TRS-80 with 16 K bytes of\nmemory, has the sole purpose of generating the Adventure-data file that will\nbe read by the\n\nAdventure-interpreter program. The program of listing 1 writes the data on a\nC-60 cassette and verifies that the tape has been correctly written. Allow\nabout 45 minutes for this program to run.\n\nThe Adventure-interpreter program appears in listing 2. It will read the tape\ndata file in about 20 minutes and then start play of the game.\n\nIf you plan to run Pirate's Adventure, on a 32 K-byte TRS-80 or larger\nmachine, you can merge the two programs as follows: delete lines 6510 thru\n6790 of listing 1. Append the data statements of listing 1 to listing 2,\nreplacing all occurrences of INPUT#D in listing 2 with the word READ.\n\nIt is possible to run this program on machines other than the TRS-80. If your\nmachine runs a version of Microsoft BASIC (eg: Apple II running Applesoft,\nCommodore PET, Exidy Sorcerer, or any Ohio Scientific computer), you will have\nfewer changes to make. Here are some of the obscure changes that may have to\nbe made (depending on your machine and version of BASIC):\n\n  * A logical operation returns the value -1 (or hexadecimal FF) when true, and 0 otherwise. For example, executing:\n\nPRINT (1=2), (1=1)\n\ncauses the numbers 0 (denoting false) and -1 (denoting true) to be printed.\n\n  * The flag SF is a 16-bit integer that is set and tested with boolean algebra commands. This can be replaced by the following:\n\n  1. Dimension SF as SF(15)\n  2. Replace F1=SF AND CINT(2\u2191LL+.5) with F1=SF(LL)\n  3. Replace SF= F OR CINT(2\u2191P+.5) with SF(P)= -1\n  4. Replace SF=SF AND NOT CINT(.5+2\u2191P) with SF(P)=0\n\n  * IF ... THEN ... ELSE statements in TRS-80 Level II BASIC assert that, if the condition being tested is true, the statements between the words THEN and ELSE are performed. If the condition is false, the statements following the ELSE are performed. If your BASIC does not have the ELSE clause, you will have to split the statement into multiple lines.\n\n  * LEFT(A$,B) returns the substring of A$ from the first character to the Bth character. Similarly, MID$(A$,B,C) returns the substring from the Bth character on, for a total of C characters, and RIGHT$(A$) returns the last (ie: rightmost) B characters in the string.\n\n  * If you cannot create a two-dimensional array of strings (eg: DIM A$(20,3) as a twenty-row by three-column array of strings), you will find conversion nearly impossible because this feature is used heavily in the program.\n\nHappy adventuring, and watch out for the tides on Pirate's Island-they can be\ntricky.\n\n## Game Credits for Scott Adams\n\nScott Adams is credited with working on the following games for Adventure\nInternational:\n\n  * Adventureland\n  * Voodoo Castle\n  * The Count\n  * Strange Odyssey\n  * Mystery Fun House\n  * Pyramid of Doom\n  * Ghost Town\n  * Pirate's Adventure\n  * Savage Island Part 1\n  * Savage Island Part 2\n  * Golden Voyage\n\n## References\n\n  1.
