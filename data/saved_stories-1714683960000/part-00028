John Lothropp (1584\u20131653) \u2013 sometimes spelled Lothrop or Lathrop \u2013 was an\nEnglish Anglican clergyman, who became a Congregationalist minister and\nemigrant to New England. He was among the first settlers of Barnstable,\nMassachusetts.\n\nLothropp was a strong proponent of the separation of church and state. This\nidea eventually became the mainstream view of people in the United States of\nAmerica, because of the efforts of Lothropp and others. Lothropp influenced\nthe culture of New England, and through that, upon the rest of the country. He\nhas had many notable descendants, including at least six US presidents, as\nwell as many other prominent governors, government leaders, leaders of the\nChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and businesspeople.\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n### Early life[edit]\n\nLothropp was born in Etton, East Riding of Yorkshire. He was baptised on 20\nDecember 1584. He attended Queens' College, Cambridge, where he matriculated\nin 1601, graduated with a BA in 1605, and with an MA in 1609.^[1]\n\n### Ministry and incarceration[edit]\n\nHe was ordained in the Church of England and appointed curate of Egerton,\nKent. In 1623 he renounced his orders and joined the Independents. Lothropp\ngained prominence in 1624, when he was called to replace Reverend Henry Jacob\nas the pastor of the 'First Independent Church' in London, a congregation of\nsixty members which met at Southwark. Church historians sometimes call this\nchurch the Jacob-Lathrop-Jessey (JLJ^[2]) Church, named for its first three\npastors, Henry Jacob, John Lothropp and Henry Jessey.\n\nThey met in private to avoid the scrutiny of the Bishop of London, William\nLaud. Following the group's discovery on 22 April 1632 by officers of the\nking, forty-two of Lothropp's Independents were arrested; only eighteen\nescaped capture. The arrested were prosecuted for failure to take the Oath of\nSupremacy. Evidence gleaned by the historians Burrage and Kiffin and from the\nJessey records indicate many were jailed in the Clink prison. As for Lothropp,\nthe question is unresolved. English historian Samuel Rawson Gardiner, whose\nbook Reports of Cases in the Courts of Star Chamber and High Commission, gives\nan account of the courtroom trial and cites information from the trial record\nthat the convicted dissenters were to be divided up and sent to various\nprisons. Historian E. B. Huntington suggests Lothropp was incarcerated in\neither the Clink or Newgate Prison.^[3] Further, it may be that Lothropp\nactually served time in both prisons since it was customary to move prisoners\nfrom one prison to another due to space availability. The end, the precise\nlocation of Lothropp's imprisonment is not confirmable from primary\ndocumentation.\n\nWhile Lothropp was in prison, his wife Hannah House became ill and died. His\nsix surviving children were, according to tradition, left to fend for\nthemselves begging for bread on the streets of London. Friends, being unable\nto care for his children, brought them to the Bishop who had charge of\nLothropp. After about a year, all were released on bail except Lothropp, who\nwas deemed too dangerous to be set at liberty. The Bishop ultimately released\nhim on bond in May 1634 with the understanding that he would immediately\nremove to the New World. Since he did not immediately leave for the New World,\na court order was subsequently put out for him. Family tradition and other\nhistorical reflections indicate he then \"escaped.\"\n\n### Emigration[edit]\n\nLothropp was told that he would be pardoned upon acceptance of terms to leave\nEngland permanently with his family along with as many of his congregation\nmembers as he could take who would not accept the authority of the Church of\nEngland. Lathropp accepted the terms of the offer and left for Plymouth,\nMassachusetts. With his group, he sailed on the Griffin and arrived in Boston\non 18 September 1634.^[4] The record found on page 71 of Governor Winthrop's\nJournal, quotes John Lothropp, a freeman, rejoicing in finding a \"church\nwithout a bishop ... and a state without a king.\" John Lothropp married Ann\n(surname unknown) (1616\u20131687).^[5]\n\nLothropp did not stay in Boston long. Within days, he and his group relocated\nto Scituate where they \"joined in covenaunt together\" along with nine others\nwho preceded them to form the \"church of Christ collected att Scituate.\"^[6]\nThe Congregation at Scituate was not a success. Dissent on the issue of\nbaptism as well as other unspecified grievances and the lack of good grazing\nland and fodder for their cattle caused the church in Scituate to split in\n1638.\n\nLothropp petitioned Governor Thomas Prence in Plymouth for a \"place for the\ntransplanting of us, to the end that God might have more glory and wee more\ncomfort.\"^[7] Thus as Otis says \"Mr. Lothropp and a large company arrived in\nBarnstable, 11 October 1639 O.S., bringing with them the crops which they had\nraised in Scituate.\"^[7] There, within three years they had built homes for\nall the families and then Lothropp began construction on a larger, sturdier\nmeeting house adjacent to Coggin's (or Cooper's) Pond, which was completed in\n1644. This building, now part of the Sturgis Library in Barnstable,\nMassachusetts is one of John Lothropp's original homes and meeting houses, and\nis now also the oldest building housing a public library in the USA.\n\n## Genealogy[edit]\n\nCoat of Arms of John Lathropp\n\n### Children[edit]\n\nLothropp married Hannah House/Howse in England, on 10 October 1610.

The National Archives at London which would hold the records for Newgate Prison indicate they have nothing earlier than 1770. The lack of documentation is attributable to the Great Fire of London (1666), the Gordon Riots (1780), and the fact that upon the abolition of the Star Chamber in 1641, the court proceedings of the reign of Charles I deteriorated and failed to survive. A report to the Lords in 1719 noted that those documents were \"in a very great heap, undigested, and without any covering from dust or security from rats and mice. \"As for records of the Clink, the National Archives indicates they would be held at the London Metropolitan Archives, but those records start from 1690. The National Archives states that records from these earlier times are also not complete due to the fact that they were not created or kept for research purposes, but for use by the government or law courts of the day.\n  4. ^ The State Papers in the new Record Office, Fetter Lane, London, preserved some of the Star Chamber records of John Lothropp's imprisoned days. The last record probably was the order of the court which opened the way for his escape to America. However, according to the National Archives, this office has not been in use since the 1860s and State Papers are now held at the National Archives.\n  5. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b ^c Great Migration 1634-1635, I-L.
