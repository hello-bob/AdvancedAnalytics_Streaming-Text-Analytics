Many of these processes have been extensively\ninvestigated in mammalian cell culture, as well as in humans and in mammalian\nmodel organisms. Most of the human genes encoding proteins involved in Cu\nhomeostasis have orthologs in the model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans (C.\nelegans). Starting with a compilation of human Cu proteins and their\northologs, this review presents an overview of Cu homeostasis in C. elegans,\ncomparing it to the human system, thereby establishing the basis for an\nassessment of the suitability of C. elegans as a model to answer mechanistic\nquestions relating to human Cu homeostasis.\n\nKeywords:\n\nC. elegans; copper transport; copper deficiency; copper toxicity; reactive\noxygen species\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nCopper is an essential trace element that is involved in a multitude of\nbiological pathways in humans, mostly as part of copper proteins that are\ncrucial to processes as diverse as mitochondrial respiration (e.g., cytochrome\nc oxidase), antioxidant defense (e.g., Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase), iron\nhomeostasis (e.g., ceruloplasmin, hephaestin), xenobiotic metabolism (e.g.,\ncopper-dependent amine oxidases), connective tissue biogenesis (e.g., lysyl\noxidase) and the generation of tyrosine metabolites (e.g., tyrosinase), to\nname a few (for review, see [1]; Table 1). All of these examples of copper-\ndependent enzymes are oxidoreductases, highlighting the role of copper in\nbiological redox reactions, with cuprous (Cu^+) and cupric (Cu^2+) ions being\nthe predominant forms of Cu in biological systems [1]. (When mentioning\n\u201ccopper\u201d or \u201cCu\u201d in this article, such as in \u201cCu homeostasis\u201d, this does not\nrefer to the metal, but rather cuprous and cupric ions).\n\nIt is this very nature of copper ions that can also contribute to Cu toxicity,\nin that its redox activity may result in the generation of potentially harmful\nreactive oxygen species (ROS), e.g., through Fenton-type reactions or redox\ncycling [2,3]. A second mode of interfering with biological processes, is, of\ncourse, through the interaction with biomolecules, such as proteins: for\nexample, according to the \u2018\u2018hard and soft acids and bases\u2019\u2019 concept [4], Cu^+,\nas a \u2018\u2018soft\u2019\u2019 cation, will avidly interact with \u2018\u2018soft\u2019\u2019 thiolates of\ncysteinyl residues in proteins.\n\nCaenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) lives and proliferates in soils in\ntemperate climates, as well as compost and other environments characterized by\ndecomposing fruits and plant material [5]; it feeds on bacteria and has been\nin use as a model organism in molecular and cell biology research laboratories\nsince its introduction into that field by Sydney Brenner [6]. In its natural\nhabitat, C. elegans is exposed to strongly fluctuating levels of environmental\ncompounds, including metal (such as copper) ions. Moreover, more than 50% of\nhuman protein-coding genes (numbers range from 60\u201380%, in older predictions\n[7], to approx. 53%, according to \u201cOrthoList2\u201d [8]), including many genes\nassociated with human diseases, have an ortholog in C. elegans. It is no\nwonder, then, that similarities between humans and C. elegans also exist at\nthe level of Cu homeostasis, including copper proteins, as well as Cu uptake,\nCu distribution and Cu excretion mechanisms.\n\nIn order to provide a background with respect to whether, and to what extent,\nC. elegans can be useful as an in vivo model for research into mammalian Cu\nhomeostasis, this review will summarize Cu homeostasis in C. elegans, compare\nit with human Cu homeostasis and discuss the adaptation to copper toxicity and\ndeficiency in nematodes.\n\n## 2\\. The Human Copper Proteome and Orthologs in C. elegans\n\nIf a portion of human genes as large as that stated above have orthologs in C.\nelegans, this would also include genes encoding copper-related proteins. In\nhumans, several dozen of Cu-related proteins have been identified so far,\nincluding Cu-dependent enzymes, Cu transporters and other Cu-related proteins.\nMost of these have orthologs in C. elegans, but the role of these orthologs in\nnematode Cu homeostasis is not always clearly defined. In order to allow for a\ndiscussion of Cu homeostasis in C. elegans and a comparison with the human\nsystem, we collated information on the human Cu proteome and searched for\northologs in C. elegans. Building on the work by Blockhuys et al. [9], who\nidentified 54 human Cu-binding proteins and allocated each to one of three\ncategories (enzymes, transporters and proteins with unknown or other\nfunctions), we used similar categories and listed known human Cu proteins,\ntogether with information on their (potential) orthologs in C. elegans. These\ndata are listed in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3, divided by category: (i) Cu\nenzymes, (ii) Cu chaperones and transporters, (iii) Cu buffers and other Cu-\nbinding proteins.\n\nOur tables have nine entries more than the previously published list [9], five\nof which are more recently identified Cu proteins: Mucin (MUC) 2 (and, by\nextension, MUC5AC and MUC5B) [10], selenium-binding protein 1 (SELENBP1; see\nSection 3.3. below) [11], and a mitochondrial Cu transporter, SLC25A3 (see\nSection 3.2.2. below) [12]. Further additions to the list are due to the\ninclusion of metallothioneins 1 and 2, as they may also bind Cu under\nconditions of Cu excess [13] (hence, their inclusion in the table listing Cu\nbuffers); and the amyloid precursor-like protein (APLP) 2, which, next to the\namyloid precursor protein (APP), has a functional Cu-binding domain [14].\nAdenosylhomocysteinase (AHCY) binds copper strongly, but it does not appear to\nbe required for enzymatic activity (for review, see [15]); the protein is,\ntherefore, listed in Table 3 (\u201cother\u201d). Another protein, previously listed as\na Cu enzyme by Blockhuys et al. [9], was\u2014based on recent publications by the\nsame group, demonstrating a protective effect of MEMO1 based on Cu\nsequestration [16,17]\u2014listed under buffer/other (Table 3); the interaction\nwith, and the transfer of Cu from MEMO1 to ATOX1 that was shown to occur in\nvitro [16], may result in it being considered a chaperone rather than buffer.\n\nIt is evident from Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3 that several human Cu proteins\ndo not have orthologs in C. elegans. No ortholog was identified or predicted\nfor 19 of the 63 human proteins. This does not always exclude the presence of\nfunctional orthologs that are not Cu proteins. For example, a manganese-\ncontaining superoxide dismutase could be considered a functional ortholog of\nCu,Zn-superoxide dismutase, as the catalyzed reaction is the same. Moreover,\nit does not necessarily mean that the number of Cu proteins is lower in\nnematodes compared to humans, as the tables reflect a unidirectional search\nfor orthologs; the purpose of this article is to assess to what extent the\nhuman Cu proteome is mirrored in the model organism C. elegans. Nevertheless,\nwe also tested whether human orthologs of C. elegans Cu proteins not listed in\nTable 1, Table 2 and Table 3 exist.\n\nTable 1.

Example: (i) SOD1, (ii) SOD1, (iii) SOD-1, (iv) sod-1; (i) COX17,\n(ii) COX17, (iii) COX-17, (iv) cox-17 (for the second example, see Table 2).\n\nA search on UniProt (organism: C. elegans, keyword \u201ccopper\u201d) for C. elegans\nCu-binding proteins was performed, followed by a reverse search for human\northologs to these nematode proteins (using the DIOPT ortholog prediction tool\nreferred to in the legend to Table 1). All of the mere 40 entries resulting\nfrom the UniProt search or their predicted human orthologs were already listed\nin Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. Moreover, we performed a search on the\nAlliance of Genome Resources page (https://www.alliancegenome.org; keyword\n\u201ccopper ion binding\u201d [22,23], accessed on 11 April 2024) using the AmiGO 2\ntool (using the filter \u201cCaenorhabditis elegans\u201d; [24]), for C. elegans Cu-\nbinding proteins. In summary, the number of known or predicted Cu proteins in\nC. elegans is lower than that in humans.\n\nThere are two caveats with these tables: (i) Many of the orthologs were\nidentified solely through predictions based on sequence analyses; whether they\nare, in fact, functional orthologs is not clear in many cases. As a\nconsequence, all orthologs in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3 can be considered\northologs by sequence. Some have also been demonstrated to be functional\northologs and are marked with an asterisk in the Tables, as described in the\nrespective table legends. (ii) Even if the functional analogy of a C. elegans\nprotein was demonstrated experimentally, it was not always clearly shown that\nthe ortholog is also a Cu-binding protein. With these caveats in mind, it is\ninteresting to note that several proteins share the same ortholog, and this\ngoes both ways: sometimes several human proteins have one common ortholog\n(e.g., the three human ferroxidases in Table 1) and sometimes a number of C.\nelegans orthologs exists for only one human protein (e.g., tyrosinase, Table\n1). This likely reflects two aspects: (i) a diversification of protein\nisoforms, depending on the biological need, e.g., tissue specificities or the\nregulation of, and changes in, gene expression in different developmental\nstages of the organism; (ii) some of the predicted C. elegans orthologs will\nhave to be tested for functional homology. An example is listed in Section\n3.2.1 below: Of the 10 predicted orthologs of the human copper transporter,\nCTR1, only one remained on the list, based on experimental evidence.\n\nThe remainder of this text will provide a comparison between Cu homeostasis in\nhumans and C. elegans. Both differences and similarities will help assess the\nusefulness of this model organism for answering concrete research questions\nregarding human Cu homeostasis and discrete aspects of the biological\nsignificance of human Cu proteins.\n\n## 3\\. Copper Homeostasis in C. elegans\n\n#### 3.1. Copper Uptake and Distribution\n\nIn C. elegans, Cu (like other metal ions) is usually ingested together with\nfood via the pharynx and enters the intestine for resorption [25,26,27].\nUnutilized copper, like other unused nutrients, will likely be excreted by\nsimple intestinal passage through the anus.\n\nFollowing intestinal resorption, i.e., import into intestinal cells, Cu may be\ntransferred to various intracellular compartments and bound to different\nproteins for cellular storage or detoxification (see Section 3.2.2). Export\nfrom intestinal cells into the pseudocoelomic cavity is required for Cu\ndistribution across the worm, similar to general nutrient exchange and\ndistribution.\n\nIt is unclear at present, which Cu-binding factor contributes to distribution\nvia pseudocoelomic fluid, but, similar to the human system [28], histidine or\nHis-containing peptides, as well as general transport proteins that happen to\nbind Cu, may be assumed to contribute. Cu buffering and detoxification would\nhave to rely on similar transport mechanisms and may be achieved through\nuptake by coelomocytes, which are capable of endocytosis and the accumulation\nof macromolecules [29,30] (Figure 1, see also Section 3.2.3.).\n\nFigure 1. Schematic representation of copper (Cu) uptake and (cellular)\ndistribution in: (A) humans and (B) C. elegans. Orthologs share the same color\nand style in (A,B). Following uptake of cupric (Cu^2+, blue circles) and\ncuprous (Cu^+, red circles) ions into cells, the predominantly present reduced\nform (Cu^+) is distributed by chaperones or glutathione (GSH): (i) to\ncytosolic target proteins, such as superoxide dismutases (SODs), (ii) to\nmitochondria, in order to load cytochrome c oxidase (CcOX) in the inner\nmitochondrial membrane and the Cu,Zn-SOD in the intermembrane space (IMS), or\n(iii) to the Golgi network, in order to load Cu proteins to be secreted.\nMetallothioneins (MTs) in human cells (A), or phytochelatins (PCs) in C.\nelegans (B) may buffer excess Cu. C. elegans also has metallothioneins (MTLs),\nbut their Cu-binding capability is disputed. PC synthase (PCS) catalyzes the\nproduction of PCs from GSH in C. elegans. Following export of Cu from cells,\nboth cuprous and cupric ions may be transported/distributed by ligands (Ls).\nIn humans, this may be albumin, among others, for C. elegans, the L is\nunknown. See text for further details. Abbreviations not defined in the\ncaptions to Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3: DMT, divalent metal ion transporter;\nSTEAP, six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate; SMF-1, yeast SMF\ndivalent cation transporter homolog. Figure created with BioRender.com.\n\nCu resorption by intestinal cells is usually more effective in the presence of\nfood. Accordingly, feeding Escherichia coli (E. coli) OP50, the standard food\nsource of laboratory C. elegans, increases the dose-dependent toxicity of\ncopper compared to copper exposure without food [26]. But when food is\navailable, a higher food-to-copper ratio can attenuate Cu toxicity [31].\nInterestingly, the exposure of C. elegans to Cu, or feeding bacteria with high\nCu content, leads to the increased expression of the metal-responsive gene\nnumr-1 in the pharynx [27,32], suggesting that the worm\u2019s response to Cu\nstress is already initiated in the pharynx, where the food is ground prior to\npassing into the digestive tract. Jackson et al. reported X-ray fluorescence\ndata suggesting a homogeneous distribution of Cu in C. elegans following\nuptake, and they did not see any variation in this pattern independent of\nwhether Cu was supplied with or without food [33]. Based on the observed\nhomogeneous distribution, they also state that, next to ingestion as the\nlikely major path of uptake, diffusion across the cuticle cannot be entirely\nruled out [33].\n\n#### 3.2. Cellular Cu Import, Distribution and Tolerance\n\n#### 3.2.1. Import\n\nIn humans, CTR1 (SLC31A1) is the major copper import protein, allowing for the\ntransport of Cu^+ across the plasma membrane [1]. The extracellular N-terminal\nregion not only binds Cu^+, shuttling it to the CTR1 pore for import, but it\nalso binds Cu^2+, facilitating its reduction prior to import [34], be that\nthrough extracellular reductases, such as STEAP family proteins [35], or low\nmolecular mass reductants, such as ascorbate [34].\n\nYuan et al. identified 10 potential CTR1 orthologs in C. elegans, whose amino\nacid sequence is 30\u201340% identical to the human protein [36]. Of these, the\nmost relevant was determined as F58G6.9, then named CHCA-1 (CTR1 homolog\nrequired for copper accumulation; see Table 2, Figure 1), based upon the\nfindings that: (i) its expression in the intestine and hypodermis during Cu\ndeficiency is enhanced, and (ii) it is required for normal growth,\nreproduction and Cu accumulation under Cu-deprived conditions [36]. In line\nwith the proposed role of the protein, a chca-1-deficient strain had lower Cu\nlevels under Cu-deficient conditions than wild-type worms. Cu supplementation\nwas then demonstrated to normalize Cu content and to rescue the growth defects\nelicited by Cu deficiency, suggesting that CHCA-1 may not be the only\nfunctional Cu importer in intestinal cells [36].\n\nTable 2.

Assuming that CHCA-1, like CTR1, is a Cu^+-specific\ntransporter, this suggests that either the reduction of divalent Cu prior to\nuptake is through a different type of reductase or that small reductants, such\nas ascorbate, contribute to Cu uptake.\n\nIn addition to CTR1, the divalent metal ion transporter 1 (DMT1, SLC11A2),\nknown to transport Fe^2+ as well as other divalent metal ions [41], was\nproposed as a potential Cu importer in humans [42]. This was challenged by\nstudies testing for the transport of metal ions into Xenopus oocytes\nexpressing DMT1, concluding that neither Cu^+ nor Cu^2+ was a substrate [43].\nNevertheless, further studies suggest that DMT1 may be used by human cells for\nCu import, in addition to CTR1 [44].\n\nAu et al. identified three DMT1 orthologs in C. elegans, encoded by smf-1,\nsmf-2 and smf-3 (named after, and found to be homologs of, the yeast SMF\ndivalent cation transporter), which are associated with the transport of\nmanganese and iron [45]. A study on toxic and neurotoxic effects of Cu and of\nCu nanoparticles in C. elegans suggests that SMF-1 (but not SMF-2) contributes\nto Cu uptake, enhancing the Cu-induced stress response and toxicity [46].\nSimilar to the human system and DMT1, the extent to which SMF proteins\ncontribute to Cu uptake in C. elegans is unclear.\n\n#### 3.2.2. Intracellular Cu Distribution\n\nFollowing import, intracellular Cu^+ is bound by glutathione (GSH) or by Cu\nchaperones [47,48]. These thiol-containing chelating peptides/proteins help to\navoid undesired redox reactions, such as Cu^+ redox cycling, generating\nsuperoxide and hydrogen peroxide, or the Fenton-type reduction of peroxides by\nCu^+, resulting in hydroxyl radical formation (Figure 2). Moreover, they\ndistribute copper subcellularly, loading Cu-dependent proteins or feeding Cu\ntransporters.\n\nFigure 2. Cu toxicity: generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).\nIntracellular reduction of cupric (blue) to cuprous (red) ions, for example by\nglutathione (GSH), may result in Cu^+ redox cycling (1), yielding superoxide\nfrom molecular oxygen. The resulting Cu^2+ may again be reduced, restarting\nthe cycle. Superoxide will spontaneously disproportionate to generate oxygen\n(not shown) and hydrogen peroxide (dashed arrow). (2) In a Fenton-type\nreaction, Cu^+ may reduce hydrogen peroxide, resulting in the generation of\nhydroxyl radicals.\n\nIn humans, Cu chaperones are known to bind Cu^+ after cellular uptake, among\nthem ATOX1 (antioxidant protein 1), CCS (copper chaperone for superoxide\ndismutase, SOD) and COX17 (cytochrome c oxidase copper chaperone) [47]. They\nallow for Cu distribution in three major directions, i.e., the Golgi system\nand the secretory pathway, as well as the plasma membrane (ATOX1, delivering\nCu^+ to the Cu-transporting ATPases, ATP7A and ATP7B), cytoplasmic as well as\nnuclear proteins (CCS, loading Cu,Zn-SOD with Cu) and mitochondria (COX17,\nproviding Cu for subunits of cytochrome c oxidase) [47,48].\n\nOrthologous Cu chaperones in C. elegans exist (Table 2) and serve the same\npurpose: preventing Cu-induced oxidative damage and promoting Cu distribution\n(see Figure 1).\n\n  * (A) The ATOX1\u2192ATP7A/B Pathway in C. elegans: CUC-1\u2192CUA-1\n\nATOX1 transfers Cu^+ to membrane-bound Cu(I) exporters, the Cu-ATPases ATP7A\nand ATP7B, also known as the Menkes disease protein and Wilson\u2019s disease\nprotein, respectively, due to their deficiencies eliciting the respective\npathobiochemical alterations in humans. Both proteins are localized to the\nmembrane of the trans-Golgi network and transport Cu^+ from the cytosol to the\nlumen of the Golgi compartment, where Cu-dependent proteins destined for\nsecretion, such as ceruloplasmin in hepatocytes, are loaded with Cu. Through\nvesicular transport, ATP7A/B may also be relocalized to the plasma membrane,\nsupporting Cu export, e.g., under conditions of Cu overload [49]. ATP7A and\nATP7B differ with respect to their expression patterns in tissues, with ATP7A\nbeing widely expressed, except in the liver, and ATP7B predominantly expressed\nin liver [49]. They also differ with regard to their subcellular trafficking\nfrom the Golgi network to the plasma membrane in polarized epithelial cells\nexposed to high levels of Cu: whereas ATP7A migrates to the basolateral\nmembrane, ATP7B is found in the apical membrane under such conditions [49,50].\nMutations in the gene encoding ATP7A lead to Menkes disease, which is\ncharacterized by a severe systemic copper deficiency, as the export of Cu from\nenterocytes (basolateral membrane) to portal blood is impaired. Deficiencies\nin ATP7B cause Wilson\u2019s disease, which is associated with Cu toxicity due to\nimpaired Cu export from the liver and hepatic hyperaccumulation of Cu [47].\n\nCUC-1 (Cu chaperonin 1) is the C. elegans ortholog of human ATOX1 and relays\ncopper to CUA-1 (Cu-ATPase 1), the (single) ortholog of both human ATP7A and\nATP7B (with 44% amino acid identity and several highly conserved domains)\n[39].\n\nIn adult C. elegans, translational [5\u2032-region::ORF fragment::GFP] reporter\nconstructs of both cuc-1 and cua-1 are predominantly expressed in the\nintestine, whereas larvae have the highest expression of both in hypodermal\ncells [37]. This suggests parallel expression patterns of these genes and is\nin line with a cooperative role of the corresponding proteins in Cu traffic.\nOne exception regarding parallel expression patterns was noted: cua-1, but not\ncuc-1, is also expressed in pharyngeal muscle cells [37,39]; the significance\nof this finding still needs to be explored.\n\nDeletion of the cuc-1 gene causes a reduction in worm length, brood size and\nsurvival under basal copper availability conditions [38]. However, the size of\nthese effects and the differences between wild-type (WT) worms and\ncuc-1-deficient mutants does not change drastically due to Cu supplementation,\nimplying that the impaired outcomes due to cuc-1 deletion are not owing to Cu\navailability per se [38]. Similarly, the expression of cuc-1 is not altered by\nthe supplementation of WT worms with copper or iron [37]. Rather, the effects\non fertility in nematodes lacking cuc-1 may be a result of the impaired\nmaturation of the gonads, based on the defective migration of distal cells\n[38].\n\nThe activity of CUA-1 as a Cu transporter was suggested by complementation\nassays in yeast and murine cells: the heterologous expression of cua-1 was\ncapable of rescuing a deficiency in Ccc2, an ortholog of ATP7A/B in S.\ncerevisiae [51]. Moreover, the transgenic expression of cua-1.1::gfp in\nAtp7a^\u2212/\u2212 mouse embryonic fibroblasts normalized the Cu concentrations in\ncells with over-accumulated Cu, implying that CUA-1.1::GFP contributes to Cu\nexport [39]. Recently, Catalano et al. generated a novel cua-1 mutant strain,\nwith CUA-1 altered in a way to imitate a common ATP7B variant present in\nWilson\u2019s disease patients. These cua-1 mutant worms were considerably less\nresistant to Cu than wild-type worms, as evident from data showing delayed\ndevelopment, decreased life span and neuronal damage [52], rendering this C.\nelegans strain a suitable model for the analysis of Cu homeostasis and\ntoxicity in Wilson\u2019s disease.\n\nIn C. elegans, the cua-1 transcript has two splice isoforms, cua-1.1 and\ncua-1.2. The latter differs from cua-1.1 in that it is devoid of the first two\nexons that encode one of the putative N-terminal metal-binding domains [39].\n\nSimilar to ATP7A/B in humans, the localization of CUA-1.1 in intestinal cells\nvaries with copper availability (see Figure 3): under basal conditions,\nCUA-1.1 localizes to basolateral membranes and intracellular compartments,\nsuch as the Golgi apparatus; under conditions of Cu deficiency, cua-1\nexpression is upregulated, and CUA-1.1 predominantly localizes to basolateral\nmembranes, which is required for the efflux of copper into the pseudocoelom,\nallowing for Cu distribution to peripheral tissues [39]. Cu overload causes\nthe relocalization of CUA-1.1 to the membrane of gut granules in the\nintestinal cells of C. elegans, allowing for Cu sequestration (rather than the\ndistribution of toxic levels to peripheral tissues) [39]. In hypodermal cells,\nCUA-1.1 is localized to the plasma membrane independently of copper supply.\nThe expression of cua-1, however, is increased by Cu deprivation in L1 worms,\nas demonstrated both by the decreased endogenous cua-1 mRNA levels and the use\nof a translational reporter [39] (see Figure 3). The second isoform, CUA-1.2,\nis constitutively localized to the basolateral membrane of intestinal cells\n[39]. Chun et al. hypothesized that intestinal CUA-1 may serve both functions\nthat, in humans, are attributed to intestinal ATP7A and hepatic ATP7B. The\nauthors investigated the effects of intestine-specific downregulation of\ncua-1. The effects\u2014a reduction in fecundity under basal and copper-depleted\nconditions, with progeny numbers comparable to whole-body cua-1 RNAi\u2014suggest\nthat the regulation of intestinal cua-1 expression is the key to regulating Cu\nuptake and toxicity [39]. In fact, RNA interference targeting cua-1 or cuc-1,\nfollowing Cu supplementation, leads to an approximate 30% reduction in the\ntotal copper content compared to the controls [39].\n\nFigure 3. Schematic representation of cellular processes in C. elegans upon\nexposure to excess Cu (left panel) and under conditions of Cu deprivation\n(right panel). Upon copper overload, CUA-1.1 localizes to gut granules (see\nSection 3.2.3). To ensure availability and distribution of Cu, even under Cu\ndeprivation, chca-1 expression is upregulated in the intestine and hypodermis\nand CUA-1.1 localizes to the intestinal basolateral membrane.

Humans have three SODs, SOD1-SOD3. SOD1 is\na cytosolic enzyme that is also present in the mitochondrial intermembrane\nspace (IMS) [53,54] and that clearly requires Cu (as well as Zn) for full\nactivity. When the protein now called SOD1 was first identified as an enzyme\nwith SOD activity in 1969, it was already known that it contains Cu [55], and\ncrystal structure analyses were published in the early 1980s [56]. Similarly,\nextracellular SOD (EC-SOD, SOD3) is a Cu/Zn-containing SOD, albeit\nstructurally distinct from SOD1. Lastly, SOD2 is an enzyme in the\nmitochondrial matrix, with manganese at its active site (Mn-SOD).\n\nC. elegans has five SOD orthologs [20,57,58]. Two cytosolic forms (analogous\nto human SOD1) are encoded by sod-1 and sod-5, whereas sod-4 encodes an\nextracellular SOD (analogous to human SOD3). All three are Cu- and Zn-\ndependent SODs. Mitochondrial SODs (analogous to human SOD2) are encoded by\nsod-2 and sod-3. The gene encoding Cu-dependent cytosolic SOD-5 is expressed\nmainly in the dauer larva stage, while sod-1 encodes the major Cu,Zn-SOD\nisoform in general [20,57]. The expression patterns observed for an sod-5::gfp\nreporter suggest that sod-5 is expressed in a few neurons of the amphid, a\nchemosensory organ, including ASI and ASK neurons [57], which are known to\ncontribute to Cu sensing [59,60].\n\nThe enzymatic activity of these SODs requires Cu at the active site, which\ncycles between its cuprous and cupric states. Human SOD1 is loaded with Cu by\nCCS, also in the mitochondrial IMS [54], a pathway also found in other\neukaryotic organisms (for review, see [61]). In humans, CCS-dependent Cu\ntransfer to SOD1 is, to a minor extent, complemented by CCS-independent\nmechanisms. These, however, have not been entirely elucidated with respect to\nthe molecule(s) transferring Cu to SOD; several thiol-containing molecules\nhave been hypothesized, including glutathione (GSH) [61].\n\nIn C. elegans, there is no CCS ortholog. A series of experiments in yeast with\nheterologously expressed human SOD1 and worm SOD-1 demonstrated that the\nprotein from C. elegans required GSH and was inactive without GSH even in the\npresence of (yeast) CCS [20]. GSH, therefore, appears to \u201creplace\u201d CCS in C.\nelegans. Or, in other words, although C. elegans cannot be used to investigate\nthe physiological effects of CCS, it may still serve as a model for CCS-\nindependent Cu transfer, which was also observed in human cells (see above).\n\nInterestingly, it was suggested that Cu may be transferred to proteins other\nthan SODs by GSH and also glutaredoxins: isolated human GRX1 was demonstrated\nto transfer Cu to ATOX1 or ATP7B [62]. Considering the similarities in the\nglutaredoxin systems between humans and C. elegans [63,64], the role of\nglutaredoxins in Cu homeostasis may be explored further using C. elegans as an\nappropriate model.\n\n  * (C) Mitochondrial Cu Chaperones\n\nThe mitochondrial respiratory chain requires Cu, as complex IV, i.e.,\ncytochrome c oxidase (CcOx), is a cuproenzyme complex. Of its two Cu sites,\nCu_A and Cu_B, Cu_A is a dicopper site. Another mitochondrial copper protein\nfrequently overlooked as it is usually regarded predominantly as cytoplasmic,\nis SOD1 (see above), which is also present in the mitochondrial IMS, as is\nCCS, the chaperone required for the Cu loading of SOD1 [54]. Both SOD1 and\nCCS, however, are proposed to enter the IMS in an immature state, not carrying\nCu [54,65]; hence, the Cu for loading SOD1 needs to be from a different\nsource. Whereas the transportation of Cu into the mammalian mitochondrial\nmatrix is catalyzed by the mitochondrial phosphate carrier, SLC25A3 [12], it\nis unclear how Cu reaches the IMS. Several hypotheses were discussed by\nZischka and Einer [66], including glutathione-mediated transportation from the\ncytosol to the IMS and Cu redistribution between the matrix, IMS and cytosol\nby an unidentified ligand.\n\nRedistribution of Cu from the mitochondrial matrix to the IMS has been\nsuggested by experiments with murine cells deficient in the SLC25A3 ortholog\nand displaying lower CcOx activity: overexpression of a SLC25A3 mutant capable\nof transporting Cu, but not phosphate, rescued not only the mitochondrial Cu\nlevels but also the CcOx activity [67]. In line with these findings, SOD1 (but\nnot SOD2) activity is lowered in the mitochondria of SLC25A3-deficient cells\n[12].\n\nCu is provided to CcOx by a \u201cchaperone relay\u201d in the IMS, starting with COX17,\nwhich further distributes Cu to SCO1/SCO2 and COX11, which then donate their\nCu to the CcOx Cu_A and Cu_B sites, respectively [66,68].\n\nIt is likely that C. elegans has an ortholog of the human mitochondrial\nphosphate and Cu carrier SLC25A3, as a study on the evolutionary development\nof expressing two separate (as in yeast) vs. one (as in mammals) mitochondrial\ncarrier for phosphate and/or Cu suggests [67]. However, no functional analysis\nhas been conducted in C. elegans to that effect; OrthoList [8] and WormBase\nlist more than one ortholog, including T05F1.8 (see Table 2). Future studies\nwill have to show which of these contributes to Cu transportation across\nmitochondrial membranes. Similarly, not much information on the functional\naspects of mitochondrial copper chaperones is available for C. elegans. Again,\na search of OrthoList [8] yields merely predicted orthologs of the genes\nencoding these chaperones (cox-17, cox-11, sco-1), and analyses of the\nexpression levels in response to Cu exposure of worms of some of these genes\nhave been reported, such as, very recently, cox-17 [69].\n\n  * (D) CUTC-1\u2014A Chaperone?\n\nIn search of orthologs to bacterial Cu tolerance factors, including CutC [70],\nhuman CUTC1 was identified as a ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic (and, in\npart, nuclear) protein of 29 kDa likely involved in Cu homeostasis [71].\nAnalysis of Cu binding by CUTC1 and of structural features revealed that it is\npresent as a tetramer in human cells and it does not have a classic high-\naffinity binding site present in Cu chaperones or transporters, but that it\nbinds one Cu^+ per monomer, comparatively weakly, with a dissociation constant\nin the micromolar region [72]. It is, thus, unlikely that CUTC1 is a Cu\nchaperone or involved in Cu trafficking. The depletion of CUTC1 by siRNA\ncaused increased Cu sensitivity and apoptosis in HepG2 human hepatoma cells,\nwhile not altering the overall Cu levels in cells [73].\n\nThe C. elegans ortholog, CUTC-1, encoded by cutc-1, shares a high degree of\nidentity (39%) and similarity (59%) with the human protein, and is also likely\na cytoplasmic protein [40]. Similar to the human protein, it does not contain\nthe usual Cu-binding motifs; nevertheless, RNA interference downregulating the\nexpression of cutc-1, while not affecting overall Cu content, caused an\nexacerbation of the Cu-induced effects, such as the development of egl (egg-\nlaying defective) and pvl (protruding vulva) phenotypes [40]. At higher Cu\nconcentrations, the RNAi of cutc-1 also lowers the brood size and worm length\n[40].\n\nThese findings, together with the additional information that cutc-1\nexpression is reduced upon copper overload [40], suggest that CUTC-1, like the\nhuman counterpart, CUTC1, (i) is neither an importer or exporter protein\n(overall cellular Cu levels are not affected by its absence), (ii) nor a\nclassic Cu chaperone (weak binding of Cu) or (iii) a Cu buffer (as its\nexpression is downregulated, rather than upregulated, upon Cu stress). All\navailable evidence, however, indicates that it is involved in Cu homeostasis.\nThe exact mode of its involvement needs to be defined and, owing to the listed\nsimilarities between the human and worm protein, C. elegans seems to be a good\nmodel to further investigate the significance of human CUTC1 and worm CUTC-1.\n\n#### 3.2.3. Cellular Cu Buffers/Cu Tolerance\n\nIntracellular Cu buffers contribute to the Cu tolerance of C. elegans by\npreventing undesired effects of excess Cu ions, including the generation of\nROS and inhibition of proteins by unspecific interactions (see above).\n\nTable 3. Human Cu proteins and their C. elegans orthologs (III): Cu buffering\nproteins and other Cu-binding proteins, including those with unclear\nfunctions.\n\nTable 3.

The Cu content under\nbasal conditions (i.e., without Cu supplementation) was unaltered, independent\nof gut granule formation [78]. Moreover, the authors found that worms\ndefective in gut granule biogenesis \u201cwere similar to wild-type animals in\nsensitivity to dietary (...) copper\u201d [78]. A later study focusing on CUA-1 and\ngut granules, however, investigated the response to the exposure to elevated\nCu levels and found that both the total Cu levels and Cu sensitivity were\nindeed altered in worms defective in gut granule biogenesis relative to wild-\ntype controls: Cu accumulation under both basal and Cu-supplemented conditions\nwas attenuated, and sensitivity to high Cu levels was increased in these worms\n[39].\n\nThe discrepancies between these two studies may result from different Cu\nexposure conditions and the different general focus of the studies; in\nsummary, it appears that gut granules, while they are no Cu storage vesicles\nunder basal conditions, may serve as subcellular Cu sequestration\ncompartments, contributing to Cu detoxification under conditions of exposure\nto excess Cu.\n\n  * (B) Thiol-Mediated Chelation of Cu: Metallothioneins, Phytochelatins, Glutathione\n\nMetallothioneins (MTs) are small cysteine-rich proteins binding metal ions,\nincluding Zn^2+, Cd^2+ and Cu^+, through interaction with thiol moieties;\nhuman MT1a, for example, consists of 61 amino acyl residues, 20 of which are\ncysteines (for a thorough review on MTs, see [79]). Formally, the (apo-)\nprotein is thionein, which becomes a metallo-thionein only upon binding metal\nions; nevertheless, this distinction is usually no longer made when discussing\nthe biosynthesis of MTs or the expression of genes encoding MTs.\n\nMTs strongly bind Cu^+ [79] and may chelate excess Cu ions not bound by\nchaperones or Cu proteins. This Cu-binding capacity of metallothioneins is\neven exploited therapeutically in the treatment of Wilson\u2019s disease [80]: oral\napplication of high doses of Zn^2+ causes the upregulation of metallothionein\nformation in enterocytes through the activation of metal regulatory\ntranscription factor 1 (MTF1) [81]. Cu is then bound by enterocytic MT and not\npassed on to portal blood; rather, it is excreted with the natural shedding of\nenterocytes.\n\nThere is no ortholog of MTF1 in C. elegans, but mtl-1 and mtl-2 were\nidentified as genes encoding metallothioneins, MTL-1 and MTL-2 (Table 3),\nwhich share the typical properties of metallothioneins, such as their small\nsize (consisting of 75 and 63 amino acids, respectively), their high cysteine\ncontent (25% and 29%, respectively) and the presence of no more than one\naromatic amino acid [82,83]. It is interesting to note that, while upregulated\nby Cd^2+ exposure [83], the expression of mtl-1/mtl-2 in C. elegans tends to\nbe downregulated under Cu stress [69,84], which renders it unlikely that\nMTL-1/2 serve as major Cu buffers. In line with this, Cu-binding activity was\ndemonstrated to be lower (relative to human MT, and relative to divalent Cd\nand Zn ions) in C. elegans metallothioneins, likely owing to the presence of\nseveral histidine residues [85]. Of note, despite these findings, an MTL-2\ndeficiency was reported to render C. elegans sensitive to Cu exposure [86],\nand a transgenic worm strain expressing pmtl-2::GFP, i.e., a GFP reporter\ncoupled to an mtl-2 promotor fragment, similar to an earlier precursor thereof\nwith a lacZ reporter [87], was successfully used as an indicator strain for\nsubtoxic environmental concentrations of metal ions, including Cu [88].\n\nThe tripeptide glutathione (GSH, \u03b3Glu\u2013Cys\u2013Gly) was described as forming Cu(I)\ncomplexes that may serve as intracellular \u201cCu transfer hubs\u201d, distributing Cu\nto Cu proteins or MTs in human hepatoma cells [89], and which can be used to\nreconstitute Cu-dependent SOD1 [90,91]. GSH was already mentioned above as\nbeing capable of transferring Cu to C. elegans SOD-1 [20]. Different from MTs,\nGSH is unlikely to serve as a major buffer molecule to prevent adverse effects\nof Cu excess by mere chelation and storage; rather it is crucial for the\ntransfer of Cu to buffering molecules, such as MTs, and as a major electron\ndonor for intracellular antioxidant systems, such as glutathione peroxidases\nthat may catalyze the reduction of peroxides generated in the presence of\nredox-active Cu ions [89]. A role of GSH as being involved in intracellular Cu\ndistribution was also suggested by studies on the effects of GSH depletion on\nCu homeostasis in neuronal development in Drosophila melanogaster [92]. It is\ninteresting to note that GSH in C. elegans can be depleted to some extent in\nworms, resulting not only in unimpaired, but rather improved survival under\n(oxidative) stress [93]. It is unclear at present, whether there is a link\nbetween this effect and Cu homeostasis, but the expression of genes encoding\nantioxidant enzymes was upregulated in worms following moderate (but not\nstronger) GSH depletion [93]. This moderate depletion, while upholding\nsufficient GSH levels to acutely deal with stressful stimuli, may serve as a\nsignal for cells to prepare for oxidant challenges as they occur, for example,\nupon exposure to redox-active metal ions.\n\nNext to serving as a major cellular antioxidant and as a Cu distributor, GSH\nhas a peculiar (as originally thought to be plant- and microbe-specific) third\nrole in Cu homeostasis in C. elegans: it provides building blocks for the\nbiosynthesis of major Cu chelators, phytochelatins. C. elegans has a\nphytochelatin synthase (PCS-1), catalyzing the biosynthesis of phytochelatins,\ncysteine-rich peptides, from GSH [94,95], by forming polymers of \u03b3Glu\u2013Cys\n(with up to 11 repeats) [96]:\n\n(a) 2 GSH \u2192 (\u03b3Glu\u2013Cys)_2\u2013Gly + Gly\n\n(b) (\u03b3Glu\u2013Cys)_2\u2013Gly + \u03b3Glu\u2013Cys\u2013Gly \u2192 (\u03b3Glu\u2013Cys)_3\u2013Gly + Gly, etc.\n\nIn line with the metal-chelating activity of phytochelatins, PCS-1 is required\nfor Cu tolerance in C. elegans [97]. Summing up the above evidence on MTs, GSH\nand phytochelatins, it appears likely that the latter are predominant Cu\nbuffers. A study on Cd tolerance in C. elegans has demonstrated the same for\nCd resistance, and the authors conclude that their study \u201cshowed that\nmetallothioneins do help protect against cadmium toxicity, but not to the same\nextent as phytochelatins\u201d [98].\n\nA GFP reporter under the control of a pcs-1 promotor (ppcs-1::GFP) is\nexpressed in several tissues, including the hypodermis, the pharynx (grinder,\npharyngeal\u2013intestinal valve), the body wall and vulval muscles, and\ncoelomocytes [97].\n\n  * (C) Coelomocytes Contribute to Cu Tolerance in C. elegans\n\nAdult C. elegans hermaphrodites have three pairs of coelomocytes, which are\nlocated in the pseudocoelom, and were described by Fares and Greenwald as\n\u201cscavenger cells that continuously and nonspecifically endocytose fluid from\nthe pseudocoelom\u201d [29]. In addition to expressing pcs-1, they also express\nhmt-1, a gene encoding an ortholog to the human ATP-binding cassette\ntransporter ABCB6, heavy metal tolerance factor 1 (HMT-1), contributing to Cu\nuptake into cells, including coelomocytes [97]. Based on these data and on\ntheir finding that coelomocyte-deficient nematodes are more sensitive to\ncopper toxicity than WT controls, Schwartz et al. propose that coelomocytes\nare major contributors to Cu (and Cd, as well as As) tolerance in C. elegans\n[97].\n\nIt is unclear at present, in what form Cu enters coelomocytes: is it an\nunspecific endocytotic uptake of whatever comes along, including Cu complexes,\nor is it rather a more specific uptake of certain Cu chelates, or even of Cu\nions? More recent studies on HMT-1 in C. elegans intestinal cells demonstrate\nthat, subcellularly, HMT-1 is linked to the recycling endosomal compartment\n[99], which may point to either of the first two options, i.e., the\nendocytotic uptake of Cu complexes.\n\nAnother open question concerns the fate of Cu taken up by coelomocytes, and\nfurther studies will have to elucidate whether Cu is merely deposited in these\ncells in an \u201cinert\u201d form, for example as a Cu\u2013phytochelatin complex, or rather\nstored transiently to serve as a backup system in times of Cu deprivation.\n\n#### 3.3. From Orthologs to Conserved Mechanisms: Molecular Aspects of\nIntracellular Cu Transport\n\nA number of functional and sequence orthologs of Cu proteins have been\ndescribed above and listed in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. Here, we ask to\nwhat extent the functional homologies are reflected at a molecular level and,\nas an example, focus on the well-described \u201cCu-relay\u201d in human cells from the\nuptake by CTR1 to the secretory pathway via ATOX1 and the passage of ATP7A/B\ninto the Golgi lumen (for review, see [100,101]).\n\n#### 3.3.1. Conservation of Domains Involved in Cu Uptake by CTR1 and CHCA-1\n\nAs described above, cellular Cu uptake is predominantly through CTR1, and in\nthe cuprous form. CTR1 is a homotrimeric transmembrane protein of 21\nkDa/subunit. Its extracellular N-terminal region binds both Cu^+ and Cu^2+,\nthe latter likely to facilitate its reduction prior to relaying it to the\ntransmembrane channel [34]. Several Cu-binding motifs were identified in the\nN-terminal region (Figure 4A), including two Cu^2+ sites, an \u201camino-terminal\nCu(II) and Ni(II) binding\u201d (ATCUN) motif, ^1MDH^3 [102] (Figure 4B), as well\nas ^22HHH^24 [103]. Three Cu^+ binding sites per monomer were identified as\n^5HHM^7/^7MxMxxM^12 (with x being any residue) (Figure 4C), ^40MMM^42 and\n^42MMxM^45 [102,103].\n\nFigure 4. Conserved domains in the copper transporters CTR1 and CHCA-1. (A)\nSequence alignment of human (h. s.) CTR1 and C. elegans (c. e.) CHCA-1, using\nUniProt entries O15431 and Q5CZ44, respectively, and Clustal Omega alignment\ntool.

(B) Structure of cupric ions bound to the \u201camino-\nterminal Cu(II) and Ni(II) binding\u201d (ATCUN) motif in CTR1. Met and Asp side\nchains are indicated by X. (C) Binding of cuprous ions by a methionine-rich\nmotif in the extracellular region of CTR1 [104].\n\nThe attraction of Cu to the extracellular CTR1 region may be supported by the\npresence of negative charges, as provided by Asp and Glu residues [105]: The\n65 N-terminal residues contain four charged residues, 3 Asp, 1 Glu and 1 Lys,\nyielding a net negative charge of \u22123 per monomer.\n\nThe predicted extracellular N-terminal region of CHCA-1 is from Met1 to Ala43\n(AlphaFold [106]; https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/Q5CZ44, accessed 17 March\n2024), and this region shares many of the features of CTR1. (i) The N-terminus\nis rich in methionines (eight Met overall in the extracellular region),\nproviding multiple putative Cu^+-binding sites: ^1MxMMxMxMxxM^11 and\n^21MxMxxH^26; (ii) although no ATCUN motif is present in the C. elegans\nprotein, ^26HxDxED^31 could represent a potential Cu^2+-binding site. As for\nthe cation-attracting charge, there is, however, no net surplus of negative\ncharge (with two Lys, two Arg, three Asp, one Glu, the basic and acidic\nresidues are balanced); nevertheless, it appears that Asp42 is rather close to\nthe putative channel entry and might serve the purpose of attracting Cu ions.\n\nIn the CTR1 transmembrane channel, formed by the three monomers, four\n\u201cmethionine triads\u201d are established that may serve as (transiently)\nCu^+-binding rings. Each of these consists of three adjoining methionines\nprovided by the three monomers: M45, M43, M154 and M150; the M45 and M43\ntriads may be considered entry points into the channel [105]. M150 and M154\nare conserved in CHCA-1 (M123, M127), and two further methionines are found in\nthe putative transmembrane region (M46, M74).\n\nThe 15 cytoplasmic C-terminal amino acids of CTR1 end in ^188HCH^190. From\ntheir experiments with C-terminally truncated CTR1, Maryon et al. concluded\nthat the intracellular tail (and the C-terminal HCH) \u201cmay act as a barrier,\nregulating or limiting the rate of copper exit from the pore\u201d [107]. Indeed,\nthe terminal HCH was demonstrated as a Cu^+-binding site and essential for the\nintracellular transfer of Cu^+ to ATOX1 [108]. CHCA-1 does not have a similar\nsite [36]. This could suggest that Cu uptake via CHCA-1 in C. elegans is not\nattenuated by the cytoplasmic tail. Such an unhindered uptake of Cu could mean\na growth benefit for C. elegans, as worms might be more dependent on quick and\nefficient Cu import.\n\n#### 3.3.2. Cu Binding by ATOX1/CUC-1 during Transfer to ATP7B/CUA-1\n\nAfter the release of imported Cu^+ from the CTR1 C-terminus, Cu is bound by\nATOX1 through cysteines in a CXXC motif (Figure 5) [109]. In C. elegans, CUC-1\nshares this motif [37], suggesting that it is not merely an ortholog by\nsequence (with 41% identity), but is also functionally similar. ATOX1 then\nsupplies ATP7A/B with Cu. ATP7A/B has six copper binding domains (or metal-\nbinding domains, MDB), each with a CXXC motif (Figure 5). The transfer of Cu\nto MDB4 of ATP7B requires Lys60 of ATOX1 [110,111], which is also conserved in\nCUC-1 (Lys63, Figure 5A).\n\nFigure 5.

(C) Conserved MxCxxC\nmotif (blue: methionines, red: cysteines) in human (gray) and C. elegans\n(yellow) proteins. In addition to ATOX1 and CUC-1 (see also (A)), this motif\nis conserved in the six N-terminal metal-binding domains of human ATP7B\n(UniProt P35670) [113] and C. elegans CUA-1 (UniProt G5EE14).\n\nIt appears that ATOX1 may interact with all six MDBs, but more strongly\ninteracts with MDBs 1, 2 and 4, which then further relay Cu, ultimately, to\nMDB6 [113,114,115,116]. MDB6 is close to the transmembrane region of the\ntransporter and provides Cu for transmembrane transfer [117]. The C. elegans\northolog of ATP7A/B, CUA-1 (44% identity), shares the same copper-binding\nmotifs, but appears to have only three N-terminal MDBs (Figure 5C). Cu binding\nby ATOX1 requires the cysteines in the CXXC motif to be in their reduced\nstate, which is upheld by GSH and may be facilitated by glutaredoxin GRX1\n[109,118].\n\n#### 3.4. Regulatory Aspects of Cu Homeostasis in C. elegans: From Altered\nGene Expression to Stress Response\n\nCu homeostasis in C. elegans is tightly controlled, as evident from the fact\nthat there is no direct translation of changes in environmental Cu to altered\nCu content in worms. For example, a 15-fold increase in the environmental Cu\nconcentration resulted in only a 5-fold increase in Cu content [39]. Up- and\ndownregulation, as well as altered localization of factors involved in Cu\nhomeostasis (which were introduced above), is an essential part of Cu\nhomeostatic processes, including Cu tolerance (see Figure 3). For example, Cu\ndeficiency leads to the increased expression of chca-1 in the intestine and\nhypodermis [36] and a moderate upregulation of cua-1 expression, whereas the\nexpression of cuc-1 is not changed [38]. Interestingly, excess copper does not\nalter cua-1 and cuc-1 expression [38,39], suggesting that C. elegans is rather\nequipped to secure Cu availability, dealing with the odd exposure to Cu excess\nby providing Cu buffers, such as phytochelatins (see above).\n\nThe tight control of Cu homeostasis is detectable also at the level of gene\nexpression, with patterns of genes expressed changing with the life stage\n(e.g., L1 vs. L4) and in relation to the Cu concentrations worms are being\nexposed to [119]. Several genes encoding enzymes crucial to central metabolic\npathways are among the responders to an exposure to elevated Cu, including a\nnumber of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism. In fact, Cu supplementation\nresulted in an increase in the lipid content and the size of lipid droplets\n[119].\n\nPrior to modulating gene expression, signaling cascades are being affected by\nCu exposure, including the C. elegans ortholog of the human forkhead box\ntranscription factor FOXO3, DAF-16: Similar to Cu stimulating insulin-like\nsignaling in human cells, resulting in an inactivation and nuclear exclusion\nof FOXO transcription factors [120,121,122], subcellular localization of a\nDAF-16::GFP fusion protein in C. elegans exposed to Cu was also changed,\nsuggesting its inactivation [3,121].\n\nThe lack of an MTF1 ortholog in C. elegans was already referred to above,\nwhich leaves the question open as to which transcriptional regulator (and\nregulatory upstream pathway) may contribute instead. Interestingly, MDT-15,\nthe C. elegans ortholog of human MED15, the human mediator of RNA polymerase\nII transcription complex subunit 15, is required for upregulation of the\nexpression of the metallothionein genes mtl-1 and mtl-2 in response to cadmium\nor zinc exposure [123]. Whether the same applies for Cu was not tested, but a\nlink to Cu homeostasis exists through the involvement of MDT-15 in regulating\nthe expression of a Cu protein. MDT-15 was demonstrated to be a regulator of\nthe expression of semo-1 (Y37A1B.5, [124]), encoding SEMO-1, which was\ndemonstrated to be a functional ortholog of the human selenium-binding protein\n(SELENBP1) [19], and which was demonstrated to be a novel Cu-dependent enzyme\n[11].\n\nSEMO-1 is an example of an enzyme whose activity is dependent on Cu\navailability to C. elegans: copper supplementation increases the enzymatic\nactivity, whereas it is attenuated by the addition of a copper chelator [11].\nThe loss of this enzymatic activity in worms grown in the presence of a Cu\nchelator points to an interesting aspect, namely that while a Cu excess can be\nbuffered to some extent (see above), a Cu deficiency in worms is rather simple\nto elicit experimentally, which further explains the upregulation of Cu\ntransporters under such conditions, as there appears to be the need for C.\nelegans to be well equipped to uphold Cu levels to some degree in a Cu-\ndeficient environment.\n\nSEMO-1 offers an interesting (but hypothetical) aspect on a potential role of\nCu in signaling: the enzymatic activity of the protein is that of a\nmethanethiol oxidase (MTO), catalyzing the oxidation of methanethiol, a\nbreakdown product of methionine, to generate hydrogen peroxide, hydrogen\nsulfide and formaldehyde [125,126]. Whereas formaldehyde may feed into C1\nmetabolism, the two other products are well-known redox signaling molecules\n[127,128]. It remains to be seen whether the link between Cu availability and\nthe SEMO-1-dependent production of signaling molecules translates to a\nmodulation of gene expression and stress resistance of C. elegans. In that\ncontext, it was demonstrated that the downregulation of semo-1 expression by\nRNA interference causes an increased expression of genes encoding antioxidant\nproteins, including sod-1 and sod-2 or all five glutaredoxin genes [129]. An\nindication that SEMO-1 is indeed involved in the regulation of stress\nresistance comes from the first experiments with SEMO-1-deficient worms,\ndemonstrating that SEMO-1 may confer resistance against selenite, but at the\nsame time sensitize worms to oxidative stress [19]. It is, however, not known,\nwhether these effects rely on the enzymatic activity of the protein and on the\npresence of Cu.\n\n## 4\\. Closing Remarks\n\nCopper is essential to central metabolic pathways in eukaryotic cells. With\nthe need for Cu supply, uptake and organismal as well as the cellular\ndistribution of Cu, comes the need to adapt to changing Cu availability in the\nenvironment. This includes both Cu deficiency and Cu excess, as both may have\nadverse outcomes for the organism. The purpose of this article was to provide\na background with respect to whether, and to what extent, C. elegans can be\nuseful as an in vivo model for research into mammalian Cu homeostasis.\n\nThere are clearly aspects of worm biology that do not allow for drawing direct\nconclusions regarding the human system. Some examples, in part already\nmentioned, are the following: (i) At the cellular level, the role of\nphytochelatins (and of GSH, as it provides the building blocks for these\nchelating molecules) in Cu buffering is, at present, rather unique among the\nfrequently used multicellular animal models (see Section 3.2.3), as no\nphytochelatin synthesis has been demonstrated in animals other than nematodes\nso far. (ii) Some human proteins involved in Cu homeostasis have no orthologs\nin C. elegans, including CCS (see Section 3.2.2) or the metal-responsive\ntranscriptional regulator MTF1 (see Section 3.2.3). (iii) In humans and other\nvertebrates, the excretion of Cu is, in large part, via feces [130]; it is\nunclear whether specific Cu excretion occurs in C. elegans, and, if it does,\nhow exactly it is achieved.\n\nWith such obvious differences in mind, why should C. elegans be used as a\nmodel system to analyze Cu homeostasis, if, for example, cultured human cells,\nwhich do not have an issue with missing orthologs, may be similarly\naccessible? While questions regarding Cu binding and the enzymatic activity of\nproteins can certainly be approached at a cellular and even cell-free level,\nthe biological significance of proteins sometimes comes to light in a tissue\ncontext only. For example, the above-referenced SEMO-1, as well as the human\northolog, SELENBP1, was demonstrated to be a Cu-dependent enzyme [11], but the\nsignificance of its methanethiol oxidase activity and the products generated\nor the substrate being depleted has not been fully elucidated. From the data\non C. elegans (but not from human cultured cells), it is clear that SEMO-1 is\ninvolved in the regulation of stress resistance and lifespan [19,124].\nAlthough the basis for this effect, and to what extent transcellular and\nparacrine effects play a role, remains to be resolved, it provides a read-out\nfor the biological activity of the protein beyond its enzymatic activity\n(whose significance is unknown). C. elegans, therefore, provides an accessible\nmodel to investigate the biological significance of proteins beyond the\ncellular level. The results may be pointers for further research using\nmammalian cells and animal models.\n\nThis also applies to the study of Cu homeostasis, for which C. elegans is an\nexcellent model for several reasons. (i) A multitude of human proteins\ninvolved in Cu homeostasis have structural and functional orthologs in C.\nelegans, as listed in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3 and described in Section 3.\n(ii) Even if there is no ortholog, the same principles apply: for example,\neven if there is no MTF1 ortholog, there is still the need for adaptation to\nCu excess; even if there is no CCS ortholog, there is still a mechanism\nrequired for loading Cu-dependent SODs. (iii) Underneath all these reasons\nspecific to Cu homeostasis, there are, of course, general reasons for using C.\nelegans as an animal model of biological processes in humans, such as, among\nothers, its simple structure as a multicellular organism, its short lifespan,\nits transparency and the simplicity of genetic manipulation.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nInvestigation, V.A.O. and L.-O.K.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, V.A.O.;\nwriting\u2014review and editing, L.-O.K. and J.P.; visualization, V.A.O., L.-O.K.\nand J.P.; project administration, L.-O.K. and J.P.; funding acquisition,\nL.-O.K.

Schematic representation of copper (Cu) uptake and (cellular)\ndistribution in: (A) humans and (B) C. elegans. Orthologs share the same color\nand style in (A,B). Following uptake of cupric (Cu^2+, blue circles) and\ncuprous (Cu^+, red circles) ions into cells, the predominantly present reduced\nform (Cu^+) is distributed by chaperones or glutathione (GSH): (i) to\ncytosolic target proteins, such as superoxide dismutases (SODs), (ii) to\nmitochondria, in order to load cytochrome c oxidase (CcOX) in the inner\nmitochondrial membrane and the Cu,Zn-SOD in the intermembrane space (IMS), or\n(iii) to the Golgi network, in order to load Cu proteins to be secreted.\nMetallothioneins (MTs) in human cells (A), or phytochelatins (PCs) in C.\nelegans (B) may buffer excess Cu. C. elegans also has metallothioneins (MTLs),\nbut their Cu-binding capability is disputed. PC synthase (PCS) catalyzes the\nproduction of PCs from GSH in C. elegans. Following export of Cu from cells,\nboth cuprous and cupric ions may be transported/distributed by ligands (Ls).\nIn humans, this may be albumin, among others, for C. elegans, the L is\nunknown.

(2) In a Fenton-type\nreaction, Cu^+ may reduce hydrogen peroxide, resulting in the generation of\nhydroxyl radicals.\n\nFigure 3. Schematic representation of cellular processes in C. elegans upon\nexposure to excess Cu (left panel) and under conditions of Cu deprivation\n(right panel). Upon copper overload, CUA-1.1 localizes to gut granules (see\nSection 3.2.3). To ensure availability and distribution of Cu, even under Cu\ndeprivation, chca-1 expression is upregulated in the intestine and hypodermis\nand CUA-1.1 localizes to the intestinal basolateral membrane. Black arrows in\ngrey boxes indicate \u201cupregulation\u201d and \u201cno change\u201d in protein expression,\nrespectively, after Cu excess or Cu deprivation.

CHCA-1, using\nUniProt entries O15431 and Q5CZ44, respectively, and Clustal Omega alignment\ntool. Yellow: ATCUN motif; blue: Cu^2+-binding motif; orange: Cu^+-binding\nmotif. \u201c*\u201d, \u201c:\u201d, \u201c.\u201d indicate identical, strongly similar and weakly similar\nresidues, respectively. (B) Structure of cupric ions bound to the \u201camino-\nterminal Cu(II) and Ni(II) binding\u201d (ATCUN) motif in CTR1. Met and Asp side\nchains are indicated by X. (C) Binding of cuprous ions by a methionine-rich\nmotif in the extracellular region of CTR1 [104].\n\nFigure 5. Conserved domains in the ATOX1/ATP7B and CUC-1/CUA-1 pathways. (A)\nSequence alignment of human (h. s.) ATOX1 and C. elegans (c. e.) CUC-1, using\nUniProt entries O00244 and G5EE41, respectively, and Clustal Omega alignment\ntool. \u201c*\u201d, \u201c:\u201d, \u201c.\u201d indicate identical, strongly similar and weakly similar\nresidues, respectively. (B) The 3D structure of ATOX1 (protein database, PDB\nID: 1TL4 [112]), with cysteines 12 and 15 chelating Cu^+. (C) Conserved MxCxxC\nmotif (blue: methionines, red: cysteines) in human (gray) and C. elegans\n(yellow) proteins. In addition to ATOX1 and CUC-1 (see also (A)), this motif\nis conserved in the six N-terminal metal-binding domains of human ATP7B\n(UniProt P35670) [113] and C. elegans CUA-1 (UniProt G5EE14).\n\nDisclaimer/Publisher\u2019s Note: The statements, opinions and data contained in\nall publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and\ncontributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
