It's about things I reckon are important to design\nthinking and to technological critique, and helpful for security engineers and\nhackers to think about too, so I am a fan of Chindogu, as an Art. There is\nsomething meaningful hidden within the fun. This post is my interpretation of\nit as a lens through which to see other technology we have.\n\n### Useless useful fun\n\nChindogu are items like motorised spaghetti forks, spectacle frames with mini-\nwipers, beer holder hats, anything that appears on the surface to be a\nbrilliant idea, yet will be in a landfill in no time. Chindogu is both cool\nand a joke. It has a small window of life, yet remains ironic immediately upon\nfashion-death.\n\nChindogu cannot be absurd. Inflatable dart boards, water-proof sponges and\nash-trays for motorbikes do not count. A contradiction is subtly hidden within\nchindogu. It has to seem useful. Moreover, it must have appeal.\n\nObviously, objects of any genuine and lasting appeal or utility - medicines,\nvehicles, clocks - are not candidates, and neither are games, having no\nserious utility but offering enduring pleasure.\n\nChindogu makes you briefly excited to discover the ingenious invention your\nlife has been sorely missing, only to simultaneously realise that it's\nabsolutely pointless (the invention, that is).\n\nChindogu cannot be merely 'tat'. Porcelain kitten dioramas and singing fish\nhave kitsch appeal, but offer no pretence at utility.\n\nFinally, Eierlegende Wolfmilchsau ^1 things - merely incongruous compositions\nof other minor utility - like those multi-function wind-up alarm clock radio\ntorches - do not count.\n\nChindogu may combine elements of all the above, but transcends their sum.\nBeing neither absurd, nor truly useful Chindogu has a certain dark, tragic\nelement to it. There is a (not immediately obvious) distance between its cute,\npathetic attractiveness as an idea begging to be taken seriously, and the sad\nreality of its likely life. Chindogu is a misplaced reaction of humanity to\nits own technological power and co-existent self-abuse through technology.\n\nChindogu is on the edge of technology, but in a human dimension we see less\nof, since we are distracted counting the numbers on the other edge of\nprogress.\n\nNobody is ever 'the first to buy' chindogu unless they are horribly drunk.\nVirality plays a big part in the phenomena. Once one person buys, and is seen\nwith chindogu, sales of those items rapidly rise. Like hoola hoops or fidget\nspinners the objects are best worn as a badge of self-mocking pseudo-\nconformity.\n\n### Society's self measuring sticks\n\nWhy is this Japanese art word so important? Because it lampoons modern\ntechnological thinking in a way that should make us think. It is a funnier,\nlighter, far less serious tool of technological critique than the eco-techne\nof Ellul, Postman, Meadows, McLuhan etc. Chindogu is a conceptual marker\nagainst which to judge other technologies.\n\nThe telemetry it returns is a measure of societal self respect. It is one of\nthe few markers for dignity (adjacent to but often confused with privacy and\ncontrol). It makes an axis between the humiliating demands a technology puts\non its user and the apparent benefits, which may exist in marginal markets,\nfor example, glasses with flashing LEDs are a great disposable party\naccessory. The same product ruggedised and sold in outdoors stores for\nmountain and caving is a lifesaving piece of kit.\n\nUnder strange quantum conditions objects can transition between the chindogu\nuniverse and our reality. The selfie stick is a real example of a joke object\nthat made the leap. In 1995 the selfie stick seemed a joke because cameras\nwere big. Cameras and cellphones were huge brick-like things once, but the\nidea of a camera stick for lightweight devices isn't so silly.\n\nSince Edward Bernays and Walter Lippmann created 'consumers' along with\nmarketing to soak up excess production in the 1920s a significant volume of\neverything produced by western economies is Chindogu. It is the fat of the\nland from the a bountiful era of capitalism. Most of it is consigned to the\nlandfill archaeology of future civilisations.\n\nSo chindogu is about the threshold between the real and the unreal. Things can\ncross the threshold if conditions are right. It's part of our collective\nconscious direction with technology.\n\nForget the idea that \"spontaneous utilitarian consumer demand\" drives markets.\nThat mid 20^th century 'pull model' passed into the era of cynical manufacture\nwhere successful businesses care not about what people want (let alone need,\nor just what might sell) so much as about what people can be made to want.\n\nGenuinely new inventions able to create wild, fresh markets, like in the\ngolden age of nonlinear physics between 1940 and 1980, no longer happen. We've\nbeen in an incremental push economy for about 50 years now. Western capital\neconomies manufacture demand by influence. We once used market research, but\nsurveillance data now fills that need to shape markets.\n\nHow do consumer goods get pushed? Initially something fanciful, impossible, or\napparently a prank appears from where art touches creative engineering. It\ngets everyone talking. These are mostly ideas that are beyond immediate\npracticality. While engineers push on with problems like new materials,\nmarketers push at a boundary, within mass social media, spreading some\nacceptance of the values that the proposed product carries.\n\nThis is different from simple 'advertising' of extant utilities. Push markets\ntie-in with all of pop-culture, comics, films, events, prices, stories,\navailability of other products and so on to create a narrative of \"where\ntechnology is going\". At some point the possibilities for actual production\nmeet up with the growing demand sown in the seeds of fantasy.\n\n### Smartphone as progeny\n\nIllustrating this, another Japanese invention which portends the 'smartphone'\nis the Tamagotchi ^2. Being neither a game, nor useful object, nor pure\nkitsch, the egg shaped 'electronic pet' plays upon attachment and caring\nneeds. If the Tamagotchi is not regularly fed it dies (becoming a 'bricked'\nbit of landfill fodder). The role played by Tamagotchi in preparing the ground\nfor cellphones seems unrecognised. Today, 'pet' objects with a life of\napproximately two years, which must be fed electricity and credits, which\nprovide enormous grief and inconvenience to their owners if they get lost or\ndie, are commonplace.\n\n### Security, ethics and chindogu\n\nGenerally prank technology is harmless fun. The obvious ethical concern, for\ninternet enabled light bulbs, USB pencil sharpeners, non-rechargeable\nearphones, and unmaintainable phones is environmental. Embedding flashing LEDs\ninto disposable party wares means cadmium, arsenic, gallium and crushed micro-\nplastics will surely end up in the wild.\n\nThe main danger from motorised coffee stirers is sploshing it all over your\nfamily or workmates. Most people figure out the real practicality of gadgets\nlike that after the first go. Less obvious are the cyber security and privacy\nimplications that can pose a real threat to other people but in a silent and\ninvisible way. Frivolously embedding Bluetooth and WiFi capabilities into\nsilly objects creates an exploitable network of devices that can be harnessed\nas remote microphones, movement sensors, cameras, or as botnets and malware\nrelays.\n\nThere are also pernicious dangers like casual normalisation or spreading of\naddictive technologies that begin as a joke or curiosity but reach a critical\nmass, then become entrenched with an irreversible foothold. At the time of\nwriting this, electronic vapes and camera doorbells are the fashionable\nobjects of dubious goodness. Whether they will endure another decade, given\nhealth and privacy concerns, remains to be seen.\n\nNobody wants to limit seemingly harmless consumer goods, because nobody wants\nto stifle innovation. An example from this grey area between acceptance and\nnon-acceptance are camera eyeglasses. Recently driven back by popular\nopposition, but still lurking, are products like the Google Glass (augmented\nspectacles for covert computing, surveillance, recording and analysis).\n\nThese are super-chindogu; simultaneously \"Spy-Kids toys\" with obviously no\nplace in a civil adult society, but also immensely cool; but Why? and For\nwhat? Unlike the mountaineers eyeglasses with lights, someone creeping around\nin the bushes with eyeglass cameras feels different from our thoughts around\nthe rugged outdoor hiker.\n\nIndeed we know in our hearts that they appeal to the weakest parts of human\npsychology, selfish, voyeuristic fantasies of omnipotence and omniscience. Yet\nthey offer virtually no societal utility. Who actually needs to get a weather\nupdate, or take a photo of what they're looking at so urgently while walking\nabout that they can't pause to find another tool? They appeal to an imaginary\nsense of an urgent, hostile environment and a fantasy of \"efficiency and\ncapability\" that is schoolboyish. They are on the wrong side of the chindogu\nline and their wearers are routinely referred to as \"Glassholes\".\n\nNot to deflate any argument over the rights and wrongs of on-body surveillance\nin general and covert AV surveillance for professional reasons. Ubiquitous\nmass produced wearable surveillance is a different thing. Their mass\nproduction would be irresponsible. That's because they are more akin to\nweapons we would expect to find in a cyborg soldier's kit bag. What does that\nsay about our society and the people who market them?\n\nThe problem is that while most people would not like to live in a world where\nsuch technology is common we see its creators as playful jokers, having fun\n\"trying to make the world a better place\".\n\nWe must trust our Spidey-feelings and check-in with our sense of dignity. Are\nwe \"missing out\" on the thing that finally makes sense of life? Or making\nfools of ourselves with silly gadgets as life passes by? Are the creators\nclowns in a dark carnival foisting technologies upon us, regardless of our\nneeds? Are they pushing at the threshold of acceptance until the joke becomes\nserious? Or do we get to call out the joke, call out chindogu and enjoy it,\nbriefly for the art it is?\n\n## Footnotes:\n\n^1\n\nLegendary egg-laying woolly milk pig-chicken-sheep creature\n\n^2\n\n76 million Tamagotchi were sold.
