After taking his truck to the beach and\nstopping off at a car wash to clean it up, he parked the truck in his garage,\nwhere it decided to just stop working for a while. The screen, which runs all\nfunctions of the truck, went black, and wouldn\u2019t respond at all, even after\nperforming the factory prescribed reboot procedure. Not great.\n\n#### Related Content\n\nIt Sure Looks Like Layoffs Are Coming To Tesla\n\nYou Can't Order A Tesla Cybertruck Now Even If You Want To\n\nTesla's Cybertruck Has Finally Arrived\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nview video\n\nTesla's Cybertruck Has Finally Arrived\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nIt Sure Looks Like Layoffs Are Coming To Tesla\n\nYou Can't Order A Tesla Cybertruck Now Even If You Want To\n\nTesla's Cybertruck Has Finally Arrived\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nTesla's Cybertruck Has Finally Arrived\n\nAfter filing a ticket with Tesla to get the truck rebooted, the Cybertrucker\nwent to bed and woke up the next morning to a mostly functional truck. A call\nwith Tesla confirmed that the truck had needed a complete reboot which took\nover five hours of sitting to complete. From the moment he\u2019d initiated the\nreboot method of holding down two steering wheel buttons, the truck was\napparently working on a reboot until some time in the middle of the night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly the user doesn\u2019t mention whether Tesla was able to offer any\ninsight as to why the truck decided to stop working, if it was caused by the\ncar wash or something else entirely. The Cybertruck\u2019s owners manual does\ncaution against ever washing the truck in direct sunlight, and there is a\nsection expressly mentioning that the truck has to be switched into \u201cCar Wash\nMode\u201d before washing to avoid damage to parts of the vehicle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re out there driving a Tesla Cybertruck, maybe don\u2019t wash it for a\nwhile. You never know when you\u2019ll be left stranded waiting for the truck to\nsort itself out in five hours or so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "frontpage": true}
