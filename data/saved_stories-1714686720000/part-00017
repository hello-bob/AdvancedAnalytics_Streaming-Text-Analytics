The National Vulnerability\nDatabase (NVD) gave it a mere 7.5 score, however.\n\nAt the time of disclosure, GitLab reported that the vulnerability had existed\nsince May 2023, though there was no evidence of successful exploitation. The\naddition to CISA's KEV means this is now no longer the case, so get those\npatches installed pronto if they weren't sorted in January.\n\nThe vulnerability is classed as an improper access control flaw, offering\nattackers a zero-click route to a full account takeover.\n\nStarting in version 16.1.0, released May 1, 2023, a change was introduced that\nallowed users to reset their GitLab account passwords using a different email\naddress, and a bug in the verification process opened up the vulnerability.\n\nA specially crafted HTTP request sends a password reset link to an unverified,\nattacker-controlled email address, enabling unauthorized account takeovers.\n\nGiven the nature of GitLab's business, the obvious danger here is the\nvulnerability being abused by attackers to carry out software supply chain\nattacks \u2013 surreptitiously modifying source code to breach countless\norganizations.\n\nRussia with SolarWinds and North Korea with 3CX are two examples of\nadversarial nations with an appetite for supply chain attacks in recent years.\nRansomware crews such as REvil with Kaseya and Cl0p with MOVEit are also no\nstrangers to compromising software at the source, although CISA said it isn't\naware of any ransomware-associated activity with the GitLab flaw yet.\n\n  * Open source programming language R patches gnarly arbitrary code exec flaw\n  * Governments issue alerts after 'sophisticated' state-backed actor found exploiting flaws in Cisco security boxes\n  * Old Windows print spooler bug is latest target of Russia's Fancy Bear gang\n  * Exploit code for Palo Alto Networks zero-day now public\n\nThe upshot of all this is that admins who enabled some form of two-factor\nauthentication (2FA) in GitLab are safe and unaffected by the vulnerability.\nAnd of course you enabled 2FA, didn't you?\n\nThe following versions are vulnerable:\n\n  * 16.1 to 16.1.5\n\n  * 16.2 to 16.2.8\n\n  * 16.3 to 16.3.6\n\n  * 16.4 to 16.4.4\n\n  * 16.5 to 16.5.5\n\n  * 16.6 to 16.6.3\n\n  * 16.7 to 16.7.1\n\nShadowserver data showing number of vulnerable GitLab instances since the\nvulnerability's disclosure \u2013 click to enlarge\n\nShadowserver's data shows that the number of publicly exposed GitLab instances\nhas more than halved since the vulnerability's disclosure. There are currently\n2,149 vulnerable GitLab environments, down from 4,652 in January, with the\nlargest concentration in Europe and Asia.\n\nGitLab fixed the vulnerability in versions 16.5.6, 16.6.4, and 16.7.2, and\nalso backported the patches for versions 16.1.6, 16.2.9, 16.3.7, and 16.4.5. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\n  * GitLab\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\n  * GitLab\n  * Vulnerability\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * RSA Conference\n  * Y2K\n  * Zero Day Initiative\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Federal government of the United States\n  * Git\n  * Security\n\n#### More about\n\n1 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\n  * GitLab\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\n  * GitLab\n  * Vulnerability\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * RSA Conference\n  * Y2K\n  * Zero Day Initiative\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Federal government of the United States\n  * Git\n  * Security\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Delinea Secret Server customers should apply latest patches\n\nUpdated Attackers could nab an org's most sensitive keys if left unaddressed\n\nPatches17 days | 3\n\n#### Exploit code for Palo Alto Networks zero-day now public\n\nRace on to patch as researchers warn of mass exploitation of directory\ntraversal bug\n\nSecurity15 days | 3\n\n#### CISA in a flap as Chirp smart door locks can be trivially unlocked\nremotely\n\nHard-coded credentials last thing you want in home security app\n\nSecurity17 days | 49\n\n#### Getting on board with AI\n\nHow partnerships can provide the key to getting up and running with AI faster\nthan the competition\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### Second time lucky for Thoma Bravo, which scoops up Darktrace for $5.3B\n\nAnalysts brand deal a 'nail in the coffin' for UK tech investment\n\nSecurity6 days | 4\n\n#### Discord dismantles Spy.pet site that snooped on millions of users\n\nUpdated - Infosec in brief ALSO: Infostealer spotted hiding in CDN cache,\nantivirus update hijacked to deliver virus, and some critical vulns\n\nSecurity4 days | 3\n\n#### Qantas app glitch sees boarding passes fly to other accounts\n\nIssue now resolved and isn't thought to be the work of criminals\n\nCSO1 day | 7\n\n#### Open source programming language R patches gnarly arbitrary code exec\nflaw\n\nUpdated An ACE in the hole for miscreants\n\nPatches2 days | 1\n\n#### US charges Iranians with cyber snooping on government, companies\n\nTheir holiday options are now far more restricted\n\nCyber-crime8 days |\n\n#### Mandiant: Orgs are detecting cybercriminals faster than ever\n\nThe 'big victory for the good guys' shouldn't be celebrated too much, though\n\nSecurity9 days | 2\n\n#### Researchers claim Windows Defender can be fooled into deleting databases\n\nBLACK HAT ASIA Two rounds of reports and patches may not have completely\nclosed this hole\n\nSecurity11 days | 17\n\n#### UK lays down fresh legislation banning crummy default device passwords\n\nNew laws mean vendors need to make clear how long you'll get updates too\n\nCSO3 days | 75\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
