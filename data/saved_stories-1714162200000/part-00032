John Cleese extols virtues of stem cell treatment\n\nTherapy has remarkable medical potential but experts say private clinics\nmaking far-reaching claims operate in regulatory grey zone\n\nHannah Devlin Science correspondent\n\nShare\n\nStem cells have become a favoured miracle treatment among the rich and famous,\nwith Kim Kardashian reportedly a fan of stem cell facials and Cristiano\nRonaldo turning to stem cell injections after a hamstring injury.\n\nThe latest to extol their benefits is the Monty Python actor John Cleese, who\nsuggests that stem cells could hold the secret to eternal youth \u2013 or, at\nleast, buy him \u201ca few extra years\u201d.\n\nIn an interview with Saga magazine, the 84-year-old revealed that for the past\ntwo decades he has been paying a private Swiss clinic \u00a317,000 every 12 to 18\nmonths for stem cell therapy that he credits for looking \u201cnot bad\u201d for his\nage.\n\nSo is Cleese making a sound investment? Stem cells have remarkable medical\npotential. They are the body\u2019s master cells that, in the embryo, go on to\nproduce every cell type in the body. Even in adulthood our body retains\nreserves of less versatile stem cells that mobilise to repair injuries and\ncontinually regenerate skin and other tissues.\n\nStem cell transplants have long been used in treating leukaemia and there are\na wealth of groundbreaking trials using stem cells to treat genetic skin\ndisorders, Parkinson\u2019s disease and epilepsy.\n\nHowever, there are also private clinics making far-reaching claims that fall\ninto a regulatory \u201cgrey zone\u201d because these therapies use patients\u2019 own cells\nrather than drugs that would need to be licensed.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a single clinical trial indicating that these treatments are safe\nor effective,\u201d said Prof Darius Widera, a stem cell biologist at the\nUniversity of Reading. \u201cAll of these clinics are exploiting a regulatory\nloophole.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear what type of therapy Cleese has been receiving, although he\ndescribed something like a biological MOT, saying: \u201cThese cells travel around\nthe body and when they discover a place that needs repair, they\u2019ll change into\nthe cells that you want for repair, so they might become cartilage cells or\nliver cells.\u201d\n\nTypically, clinics extract stem cells from fat tissue, multiply them in the\nlab and re-infuse them. Widera is blunt in his verdict on the likelihood of\nstem cells achieving the intended effects: \u201cNo, they won\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nAdult stem cells are already somewhat specialised and so won\u2019t readily turn\ninto liver cells, for instance. And the body becomes less efficient at\nrecruiting stem cells as we get older, whether they are injected or not.\n\n\u201cIf you transplant a stem cell into an old environment it won\u2019t work as well,\u201d\nsaid Prof Ilaria Bellantuono, co-director of the Healthy Lifespan Institute at\nthe University of Sheffield. \u201cThey will be influenced by their old\nenvironment.\u201d\n\nThere are also concerns about the safety of such therapies. Several patients\nlost their sight after receiving stem-cell treatment for degenerative eye\nconditions at an unregulated clinic in Florida. Other complications from\nunregulated treatments include life-threatening infections, tumours, heart\nattacks or even death.\n\nProf Paul Knoepfler, a stem cell expert at the University of California,\nDavis, said: \u201cI love John Cleese, but I worry that his stem cell anti-ageing\nattempts could do more harm than good.\n\n\u201cFirst, the stem cells he regularly gets could pose health risks to him. It\u2019s\nnot clear that any particular kind of stem cells are safe or effective unless\nthey\u2019ve undergone careful clinical trials. Also, the claims he makes about\nanti-ageing are unproven.\n\n\u201cThe second thing is that over-exuberant statements made by celebrities about\nwhat stem cells might have done for them can encourage everyday people to\nfollow their lead with both health and financial risks.\u201d\n\nCleese says he has been receiving stem cell therapy for 20 years, which would\nmake him an early adopter but now leaves him behind the curve. In the last few\nyears, the field of longevity research has shifted away from stem cells as\nscientists and Silicon Valley billionaires have turned their focus to the\npotential of various molecules to \u201crewind the clock\u201d on cells throughout the\nbody. There is compelling evidence that such life-extending treatments work in\nanimals at least, with one team reporting the oldest living lab rat last year.\n\n\u201cSmall molecules in the field is really the future,\u201d said Prof Evelyne\nBischof, who carries out research into longevity at Jiaotong School of\nMedicine in Shanghai.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether longevity drugs have similarly impressive\nrejuvenating effects in humans as in rodents. But unlike stem cell infusions,\nwhich require bespoke preparations that are administered by medical\nprofessionals, such anti-ageing pills could become mainstream rather than\nremaining the preserve of Hollywood stars.\n\n\u201cIt will be small molecule drugs that will make the real change,\u201d said\nBischof. \u201cNot just for the patient, but also for accessibility.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Stem cells\n  * John Cleese\n  * Medical research\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * World\n  * UK\n  * Climate crisis\n  * Ukraine\n  * Environment\n  * Science\n  * Global development\n  * Football\n  * Tech\n  * Business\n  * Obituaries\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
