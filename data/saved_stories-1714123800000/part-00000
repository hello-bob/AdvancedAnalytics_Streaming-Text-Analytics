A\nxenocryst is an individual foreign crystal included within an igneous body.\nExamples of xenocrysts are quartz crystals in a silica-deficient lava and\ndiamonds within kimberlite diatremes. Xenoliths can be non-uniform within\nindividual locations, even in areas which are spatially limited, e.g.\nrhyolite-dominated lava of Niijima volcano (Japan) contains two types of\ngabbroic xenoliths which are of different origin - they were formed in\ndifferent temperature and pressure conditions.^[2]\n\nAlthough the term xenolith is most commonly associated with inclusions in\nigneous rocks,^[3] a broad definition could also include rock fragments which\nhave become encased in sedimentary rock.^[4]^[5] Xenoliths have been found in\nsome meteorites.^[6]\n\nTo be considered a true xenolith, the included rock must be identifiably\ndifferent from the rock in which it is enveloped; an included rock of similar\ntype is called an autolith or a cognate inclusion.\n\nXenoliths and xenocrysts provide important information about the composition\nof the otherwise inaccessible mantle. Basalts, kimberlites, lamproites and\nlamprophyres, which have their source in the upper mantle, often contain\nfragments and crystals assumed to be a part of the originating mantle\nmineralogy. Xenoliths of dunite, peridotite and spinel lherzolite in basaltic\nlava flows are one example. Kimberlites contain, in addition to diamond\nxenocrysts, fragments of lherzolites of varying composition. The aluminium-\nbearing minerals of these fragments provide clues to the depth of origin.\nCalcic plagioclase is stable to a depth of 25 km (16 mi). Between 25 km (16\nmi) and about 60 km (37 mi), spinel is the stable aluminium phase. At depths\ngreater than about 60 km, dense garnet becomes the aluminium-bearing mineral.\nSome kimberlites contain xenoliths of eclogite, which is considered to be the\nhigh-pressure metamorphic product of basaltic oceanic crust, as it descends\ninto the mantle along subduction zones.^[7]\n\nThe large-scale inclusion of foreign rock strata at the margins of an igneous\nintrusion is called a roof pendant.\n\n## Examples[edit]\n\n  * Xenoliths in granodiorite of the Alta Stock, Little Cottonwood Canyon, Utah\n\n  * Large xenolith of sandstone (probably from the Albee Formation) within the Fairlee Pluton in Vermont\n\n  * Peridotite (green) mantle xenolith within a (dark) volcanic bomb from Vulkaneifel, Germany (coin of one euro for scale)\n\n  * Rounded, yellow, weathered peridotite xenolith in a nephelinite lava flow at Kaiserstuhl, SW Germany\n\n  * Large xenolith of Baltimore Gneiss in the Guilford Quartz Monzonite in a wall of the old Waltersville Quarry, Granite, Maryland (about 1895)\n\n  * Lamprophyre with xenolith at Ontario, Canada.\n\n  * Xenolith in granite near Donner Pass, California (foot for scale).\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Hansteen, Thor H; Troll, Valentin R (2003-02-14). \"Oxygen isotope composition of xenoliths from the oceanic crust and volcanic edifice beneath Gran Canaria (Canary Islands): consequences for crustal contamination of ascending magmas\".

This book is based on the\nauthor's experience of teaching Haskell for more than twenty years. All\nconcepts are explained from first principles and no programming experience is\nrequired, making the book accessible to a broad spectrum of readers.\n\nPart I introduces the basic concepts of pure programming in Haskell and is\nstructured around the core features of the language. Part II covers impure\nprogramming and a range of more advanced topics. The book contains many\nextended programming examples, and each chapter includes a series of exercises\nand suggestions for further reading.\n\nThis new edition has been extensively updated and expanded to include recent\nand more advanced features of Haskell, new examples and exercises, selected\nsolutions, and freely downloadable lecture videos, slides and example code.\nThe presentation is clean and simple, while also being fully compliant with\nthe latest version of the language, including recent changes concerning\napplicative, monadic, foldable and traversable types.\n\nGraham Hutton is Professor of Computer Science at the University of\nNottingham. He has taught Haskell to thousands of students and received many\nawards for his teaching. Hutton has served as an editor of the Journal of\nFunctional Programming, Chair of the Haskell Symposium and the International\nConference on Functional Programming, Vice-Chair of the ACM Special Interest\nGroup on Programming Languages, and he is an ACM Distinguished Scientist.\n\n## Contents\n\nThe table of contents, foreword, preface and first two chapters can be viewed\nhere.\n\nForeword Preface Part I.
