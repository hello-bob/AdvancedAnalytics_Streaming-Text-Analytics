This is crucial for hosting servers, enhancing security, and facilitating seamless peer-to-peer (P2P) communications.\n  * Why can't I cancel my current internet provider?\n  * IPv6 addresses are not internet services and therefore you will still need connectivity to the internet. What IPv6rs provides is a unique IPv6 IP for your computer so that it can be viewable and reachable from the global internet. If your computer is behind a router, it is likely unviewable and unreachable.\n  * Who is this for?\n  * This service is ideal for tech enthusiasts, developers, small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and anyone interested in hosting their own web, email, game servers, or other internet services directly from their premises. It's also beneficial for those looking to experiment with or deploy IPv6 infrastructure.\n  * What are some alternatives?\n  * Alternatives include sticking with IPv4 and using dynamic DNS services, virtual private servers (VPS), or cloud hosting services. However, these might not offer the same level of control or direct access provided by having a public IPv6 address.\n  * Do I need a routable external IP to use this?\n  * Unlike other IPv6 tunnel providers, IPv6rs does not require an externally routable IP. Instead, we provide you an externally routable IP and you can become a real peer, with a Visible IP, on the internet... the way it was meant to be.\n  * What is the difference between IPv6 and IPv4?\n  * IPv6 and IPv4 are both internet protocols, but IPv6 offers a vastly larger address space, built-in security enhancements (like IPsec), and improved efficiency for data routing. IPv4's limited address space has led to the need for workarounds like NAT, which can complicate direct device-to-device communications.\n  * What about IPv4? Do I need it to host a server?\n  * While IPv4 is still widely used, its necessity is diminishing as the world transitions to IPv6. That said, if you want the old internet to still be able to reach you, you can use our SNI based proxy service to route IPv4 traffic as well.\n  * What kind of servers can I host?\n  * With a public IPv6 address, you can host virtually any type of server: web servers, email servers, file servers, game servers, IoT (Internet of Things) device gateways, and more. The direct connectivity enables better performance and control.\n  * Is this eco-friendly? I want to reduce my carbon footprint.\n  * Hosting servers with IPv6 can be eco-friendly, especially if you're using energy-efficient hardware and renewable energy sources. By hosting services directly, you might reduce the demand on large data centers, which are significant energy consumers, thus potentially lowering your overall carbon footprint -- especially since you're already using your computer anyway!\n\n## About IPv6rs\n\nWe are dedicated to bridging the gap between the present and the future of\nonline connectivity. With the digital world rapidly expanding, the need for a\nmore robust and secure internet protocol has never been more critical. This is\nwhere IPv6 comes in.\n\nThe inception of IPv6rs is rooted in the significant strides being made\ntowards IPv6 adoption worldwide. As the internet grows, the limitations of\nIPv4 have become increasingly apparent\u2014limited address space, lack of\nefficient routing, and security challenges, to name a few.\n\nGoogle and Cloudflare have reported a steady increase in IPv6 adoption with\nover 40% of the internet already on IPv6, signaling a clear shift towards a\nmore decentralized, user-empowered internet.\n\nWe champion the decentralization of the internet, which brings ownership and\nfreedom back to the people.\n\nThank you for making us the world's favorite IPv6 provider!\n\n### \\- All of us on the IPv6rs Team\n\n## IPv6rs Best In-Class Global Network\n\nPowered by the most powerful networks in the world and operated by world class\ntechnicians, IPv6rs is able to deliver the fastest IPv6 Visible IP (VIP)\nservices to the last mile.
