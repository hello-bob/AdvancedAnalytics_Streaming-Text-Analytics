Then it disappeared.\n\nFor years, FireChat helped people circumvent their internet gatekeepers\u2014 the\nauthoritarian governments and spineless corporations that control our every\nmove through a network of proprietary data centers and deep-sea cables.\n\nIn Iran, forty thousand people downloaded the app when their government\nblocked internet access. Over one hundred thousand protesters in Hong Kong\nused the app to coordinate their resistance against Chinese authority.\nSingaporeans, Indians, Ecuadorians, Russians, and seemingly every pro-\ndemocracy movement globally took advantage of the off-grid messaging app.\n\nWhat made FireChat an effective tool for revolution was its ability to bypass\nthe centralized and often monopolized Internet Service Providers. Launched in\n2011 by Open Garden, FireChat allowed people to communicate without an\nInternet connection. The mobile app cleverly leveraged Bluetooth and WiFi\nsignals already emitting from our phones to create peer-to-peer connections\nknown as a mesh network.\n\nIn 2014, after Hong Kong protesters demonstrated to the world how effective a\ntool it was, news blogs quickly pointed out that FireChat messages were not\nsecure. By 2015, Open Garden updated the app to include end-to-end encryption,\na feature that many modern messaging apps still lack today.\n\nIn 2015, Wired called FireChat a \"Giant Network of Free Messaging.\u201d Indeed,\nbut it was so much more. The mesh network enabled by FireChat was a new\ninternet by the people, literally. The larger the crowd, the better the\ntechnology worked, as messages would \"bounce\u201d from phone to phone until they\nreached their recipient.\n\nFirechat updates as 40,000 Iraqis download 'mesh' chat app in censored\nBaghdad:\n\n> \"Your phone today, your smartphone, not only has a radio to connect to a\n> cell tower, but it also has other radios, like WiFi or Bluetooth, to connect\n> to other devices around,\" explains OpenGarden co-founder Micha Benoliel.\n> \"And when smartphones are next to each other with Firechat, they directly\n> interconnect.\"\n\nThe technology worked so well that Open Garden then released FireChat Alerts,\nallowing rescue workers to send offline messages during emergencies.\n\nMind you, all of this was happening off-grid, without mega corporations mining\nour data or governments spying through corporate-sanctioned back doors.\n\nThen, one day in February 2020, as COVID-19 swept the globe, access to\nFireChat was completely cut off without explanation. Four months later, a\npolice officer murdered a Black man in Minnesota, resulting in protests across\nthe United States.\n\nThose protests sparked a roaring fire of consciousness over \ufffcthis country's\ninjustices. But no one on the ground fighting for our rights has been able to\nuse the people's internet that never was.\n\nToday, if you go to the official FireChat website, you're greeted hostilely\nwith a message that your IP address has been blocked for suspicious activity.\nThe Internet Archive view of the site shows the same message, so don't feel\ntoo bad. The Open Garden website shows a similar, though admittedly less\nhostile-feeling 403 Forbidden error.\n\nNo acquisition announcement for FireChat can be found. No teary-eyed \"it's\nbeen an incredible journey\u201d open letter by its founders was ever published.\nFireChat, and then later its parent company Open Garden, closed for business\nwithout any acknowledgment.\n\nWithout any information, it's hard to say why FireChat disappeared. If pressed\nabout it, someone somewhere has a carefully constructed story with a plausible\nexplanation, I'm sure. However, by all accounts, FireChat's mesh network\ntechnology was greater than the sum of its users. It was freedom from a\nruthlessly for-profit internet that has increasingly become more centralized\nand monopolistic. And the fact that no one seems to have anything to say about\nthis once darling of Silicon Valley tells us all we need to know.\n\nFireChat is gone because FireChat was a threat to the systems it circumvented.\n\n#### Metadata\n\nlabel| name  \n---|---  \nPlot| notebook  \nPublished| 29 April 2024  \nType| note  \nPhase| sorting  \nTags| technology, internet culture  \nAssumed audience| everyone  \n  \ncaffeinate me\n\nIf you have ever found my writing valuable and you want to help me continue\navoiding doing my laundry, you can buy me a coffee.
