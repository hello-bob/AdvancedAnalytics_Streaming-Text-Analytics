Species, Temperatures, Emissions Standing on the Brink\n\nadetokunbo.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nLast year, greenhouse gas emissions reached their highest levels in the last\neight hundred thousand years, with carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide\nrecording ever frightening figures, hitting levels potentially not seen in\nmillions of years.\n\nLast year, global temperatures reached their highest levels in the last 146\nyears, when serious continuous temperature record-keeping started, as the\nplanet\u2019s average daily temperature climbed to 17.18 degrees Celsius in July,\nbeating the previous record of 16.82 degrees Celsius set on August 14,2016.\n\nLast year, the extinction rate of species reached their highest levels in the\nlast 65 million years, with the species extinction rate estimated to be\nbetween 1,000 and 10,000 times times higher than the natural extinction rate,\nwhile bacteria, fungi, plants, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians,fish,\ninvertebrates, and others disappeared with frightening speed.\n\nThe world stands on the edge of a cliff, as things other than greenhouse gas\nemissions, species extinction rates, and temperature levels reach their\nhighest rates, with the number of lakes drying up reaching the highest rates,\nthe number of rivers drying up reaching its highest rates, and the depletion\nof groundwater supplies reaching highest levels.\n\nCoal accounted for 40 percent in global carbon dioxide emissions three years\nago, hitting an all-time high of 15.3 billion tonnes, while natural gas\nemissions climbed above its 2019 levels to 7.5 billion tonnes, with crude oil\nemissions verging on unsustainable levels, even as global greenhouse gas\nemissions rates keep the planet on a trajectory to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius\nof warming before 2030 and 1.7 degrees soon after.\n\nOn land, the planet last year recorded 2.10 degrees Celsius above the 1850 to\n1900 average, the first year with a land average of more than 2.0 degrees\nCelsius, while the ocean surface waters reached an unprecedented average of\n21.1 degrees Celsius, with some experts saying the combined land and ocean\ntemperature increased at an average rate of 0.06 degrees Celsius per decade\nsince 1850.\n\nIn relations to habitats, human activity accounted for the current rate of\ndeforestation at about 160,000 square kilometers per year, with more than 50\npercent of habitats suffering from destruction in 49 of 61 old world tropical\nforests, Sub-Saharan Africa having lost about 65 percent of her tropical\nforests, alongside Asia, 65 percent of her forests gone.\n\nWith areas in the world having 65 percent of their forests gone through\ndeforestation, land and ocean temperatures showing alarming rises, and coal\nfuelling carbon dioxide emissions, the planet must find itself in the edge of\na cliff, recording the highest-ever figures in relations to temperature,\nspecies extinction rates, emission of greenhouse gasses, and other indices.\n\nBy 2050, under current conditions, global greenhouse gas emissions could rise\nby 50 percent, driven by a 70 percent increase in energy-related carbon\ndioxide emissions, with the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gasses\nrising to dangerous levels, about 685 parts per million (ppm) carbon dioxide\nequivalents.\n\nBy 2050, if humans follow a business-as-usual trend, global temperatures could\nwarm the planet by about 1.5 degrees Celsius and two to four degrees Celsius\nby 2100, meaning both land and ocean temperatures will show higher increases\nthan present-day numbers.\n\nBy 2050, with humans fueling climate change and all, species extinction could\naccelerate even more, with nearly 40 percent of species currently residing on\nthe planet becoming extinct, or facing population pressures, undergoing\ncontractions, or becoming functionally extinct.\n\nToday, the world reaches its highest levels in relations to temperature,\nspecies extinction rates, and emissions of greenhouse gasses, but the highest\nlevels of today could be a child's play compared to even higher levels by\n2050, when species extinction escalates, along with global temperatures and\ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n\nPossibilities exist for the management of global warming, but greenhouse gas\nemissions will have to show a decline by nearly half by 2030, reaching net\nzero in the near future, an idea subscribed to by over 90 nations.\n\nPossibilities exist for the control of global temperature, but ocean-based\nrenewable energy initiatives must be implemented, as this could slash\ngreenhouse gas emissions to 3.6 gigatonnes per year by 2050.\n\nPossibilities exist for the management of global species extinction rates, but\nfarmers must use best practices to produce more food on less land, meaning\ndeforestation could be slowed, as only half of the present total area of\ncroplands would be needed.\n\nWhen only half of croplands need cultivation, habitat loss declines, bringing\ndown the rate of species extinction, while the highest levels of indices\nreached in relations to temperature and greenhouse gas emissions could be\nmitigated, through accelerated renewable energy generated.\n\n##\n\nWhat to Eat\n\nVegan food from Romania, Credit, The Romanian Cookbook\n\nLeave a comment\n\nShare this post\n\n#### A Tale of Species, Temperatures, Emissions Standing on
