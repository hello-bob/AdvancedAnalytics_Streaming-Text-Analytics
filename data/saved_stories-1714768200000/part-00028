For instance, conflicts might arise over the choice between different programming languages, software architectures, or engineering processes.\n\n  * \ud83d\udcca Resource Allocation: conflicts may emerge from disagreements over allocating limited resources like time, budget, or people. Team members might have different priorities on how these resources should be allocated to various project components.\n\n  * \ud83d\udd17 Interdependence: engineering projects typically require close collaboration among various specialists. The interdependent nature of their work means that decisions and actions by one individual or subgroup can significantly affect the outcomes of others, leading to conflicts when there is misalignment.\n\n  * \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Communication Issues: poor communication can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts, especially in large or geographically distributed teams. This might involve misinterpretations of technical requirements, unclear responsibilities, or inadequate information sharing.\n\n  * \ud83e\udd1d Personal Styles and Values: differences in work styles, personal values, or professional ethics can lead to conflicts. For example, a conflict might arise between team members who value rapid innovation and those who prioritize thorough, risk-averse approaches to problem-solving.\n\n##\n\n\ud83e\ude7a How to Deal with Conflicts as an EM\n\nOver the years, I have encountered many conflicts. Initially, I approached\nthem with a bit of improvisation, but eventually, I developed a structured\nframework that has successfully helped me manage them.\n\nThis framework is heavily inspired by technical incident resolution techniques\nand includes the following steps:\n\n  * Recognize the conflict\n\n  * Identify involved parties, root cause, and conflict resolution styles\n\n  * Solve the conflict\n\n  * Monitor and follow-up\n\nLet's go through each of these steps.\n\n###\n\nRecognize the Conflict\n\nRecognizing a conflict might seem obvious, but most of the time, when the\nconflict becomes obvious, it is already late and challenging to solve.\n\nThat\u2019s why recognizing a conflict in its early stages is crucial for timely\nand effective resolution.\n\nThese are some common signs that a conflict could be around the corner:\n\n  * \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Communication Breakdown: a clear sign of conflict is a noticeable decline in communication, such as team members avoiding discussions, unanswered emails, or meetings becoming tense or unproductive.\n\n  * \ud83d\ude20 Changes in Behavior: look for increased irritability, withdrawal, or aggression among team members, as well as stress behaviors like becoming unusually quiet or overly critical.\n\n  * \ud83e\udd3c Group Fragmentation: when groups start to fragment into factions, it can indicate underlying conflicts, disrupting team unity and collaboration.\n\n  * \ud83d\udcc9 Decrease in Performance: conflicts often lead to a drop in productivity, with projects stalling, missed deadlines, and a decline in work quality.\n\n  * \ud83d\udce2 Complaints: an increase in formal and informal complaints can be a sign of conflict. Team members may express dissatisfaction about colleagues or project directions.\n\n  * \ud83d\udeab Resistance to Change: consistent opposition to new ideas or processes without constructive reasons can suggest deeper non-alignment or discontent.\n\n  * \ud83d\ude45 Body Language and Non-Verbal Cues: pay attention to body language such as crossed arms, lack of eye contact, heavy sighs, or rolling eyes during interactions, which can signal disagreement or frustration.\n\nWhile all these signals will work similarly in a remote environment, it goes\nwithout saying that it will be even more challenging to recognize these.\n\n###\n\nIdentify Involved Parties\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all recipe for resolving conflicts, so it's\nimportant to understand the involved parties.\n\nThese are the four cases you'll most likely encounter:\n\n  * Two team members have a conflict\n\n  * Two teams have a conflict\n\n  * You (the manager) and a team member have a conflict\n\n  * You (the manager) and a team have a conflict\n\nWhile the actions you will need to take to address the conflict are similar,\nthere are slight differences between these situations, particularly in cases\nwhere you are involved or not.\n\n  * \ud83d\udeab Not involved: when you are not directly involved and have to manage a conflict between two parties, it\u2019s crucial to remain impartial and act more as a facilitator to help resolve the conflict.\n\n  * \ud83d\udc65 Involved: in this case, I suggest setting aside the manager\u2019s hat and trying not to let your role influence the situation. Making everyone feel equally important and on the same level when resolving a conflict is crucial. Although I believe a good manager should be able to resolve their own conflicts, in some delicate cases, you might need to involve an external facilitator.\n\n###\n\nIdentify the Root Cause\n\nUnderstanding what is causing a conflict is the first big step to resolving\nit, and it can be one of the hardest tasks, especially if issues have\naccumulated over time.\n\nThis is what I usually do to identify the root cause:\n\n  * Collect Perspectives: request all parties involved to expose their views on what caused the conflict, better if in written form. This approach helps capture each person's perspective.\n\n  * Analyze each Perspective: use these individual points of view as the foundation for discussion. This helps ensure that all viewpoints are considered and can clarify any misunderstandings.\n\n  * Find Common Ground: identify overlapping concerns and unique issues from the discussion. This step is key to understanding the core issues driving the conflict.\n\nExample of 5 Whys technique applied to a conflict between two team members\n\nEspecially when more issues accumulate over time, there\u2019s a high chance that\nwhat you\u2019ll get from a first investigation will not be the real root cause.\nThis is where the Five Whys technique can help.\n\nThe 5 Whys is a problem-solving method developed by Sakichi Toyoda (Toyota\nMotor Corporation), which involves asking the question \"Why?\" five times or\nmore until the fundamental cause of a problem is uncovered.\n\nIt's particularly useful in complex scenarios where the initial reasoning for\na problem only scratches the surface.\n\n###\n\nChoose a Conflict Resolution Style\n\nOnce you identified the subjects involved and the root cause, it\u2019s important\nto assess the specific conflict you are dealing with and decide what kind of\nstyle you want to adopt to solve it.\n\nThe Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument (TKI) is a widely recognized tool\nfor assessing how a person deals with conflict based on two dimensions:\nassertiveness and cooperativeness.\n\nThe assessment identifies five primary styles of conflict resolution:\n\n  * Competing: high in assertiveness, low in cooperativeness. This style focuses on personal goals at others' expense and is suitable for situations requiring quick, decisive action.\n\n  * Collaborating: strong in both assertiveness and cooperativeness. It seeks solutions that fully satisfy everyone's concerns, which is ideal for complex issues needing integrative solutions.\n\n  * Compromising: balanced in assertiveness and cooperativeness. Aims for quick, mutually acceptable solutions that partially satisfy all involved.\n\n  * Avoiding: low in both assertiveness and cooperativeness. It involves avoiding the issue or delaying resolution, which is beneficial when the timing is crucial.\n\n  * Accommodating: low in assertiveness, high in cooperativeness. Prioritizing others' needs over one's own is used to maintain peace.\n\nThis tool is useful for defining the approach you want to adopt to solve a\nconflict and understanding how involved parties will approach it.\n\n###\n\nSolve the Conflict\n\nAfter gathering all the data about the ongoing conflict, it's time to work on\nits resolution. As I mentioned earlier, there's no secret formula.\n\nIf you are not directly involved, I suggest starting with the individuals who\nare. The best outcome to aim for is for the involved parties to resolve the\nissue by simply talking to each other.\n\nThis means you must work in \"stealth mode,\" holding dedicated 1:1 meetings to\npersuade those involved in the conflict to take the first step. In my\nexperience, this is the most genuine way to resolve a conflict, although it is\nundoubtedly challenging to achieve.\n\nIf this approach does not work, you must step in and act as a facilitator.\n\nHere are some great tools and exercises you can use to facilitate conflict\nresolution:\n\n  * Role Reversal: in this exercise, each party is asked to present the other party's point of view as accurately as possible. This often helps each person understand the other's perspective better and can reveal common ground that wasn't apparent before.\n\n  * Interest-Based Relational (IBR) Approach: this technique, described in the book \"Getting to Yes\" (one of the best books on conflict resolution I know), focuses on the underlying interests of the parties involved rather than their current positions. By identifying and discussing everyone\u2019s interests, this method aims to find solutions that satisfy the needs of all parties.\n\n  * Conflict Management Canvas: this great tool created by\n\nGustavo Razzetti\n\n, which I recently discovered, is a structured canvas designed \u201cto help teams\naddress conflict by reflecting on past issues and identifying learnings to\nbetter prepare to solve current tensions\u201d.\n\n  * Cooling-Off Period: taking a structured break during a heated discussion can serve as an exercise to calm down, collect thoughts, and reassess the situation with a clearer mind.\n\n###\n\nMonitor and Follow-Up\n\nRarely in my career have I seen conflicts resolve and never reappear.\n\nThat's why, similar to handling technical issues, it's important to \"set\nalerts\" and monitor conflicts once they are resolved.\n\nYou can use your 1:1 meetings to perform these health checks and take notes\n(you know I'm a big fan of journaling) to always have historical data\navailable in case the same conflict arises again.\n\n##\n\n\ud83c\udfc1 Conclusion and Final Tips\n\nWhile challenging and energy-demanding, conflicts are a healthy part of team\nlife. If managed correctly, they often lead to team growth and relationship\nstrengthening.\n\nThat's why it's crucial not to demonize conflict itself.\n\nHaving a structured approach and sharing it with your team is a great starting\npoint to help you navigate these situations.\n\nHere are some more tips based on my experience:\n\n  * \ud83d\udd70\ufe0f No rush: unless it's very practical and simple, solving a conflict is not something you can do in a day. Embrace patience and be prepared to invest part of your time.\n\n  * \ud83d\udeab No Blame: avoid pointing fingers and assigning fault. Focus on the issue rather than the people involved. This helps maintain a constructive atmosphere and prevents defensive reactions.\n\n  * \ud83c\udfe0 Create a Safe Environment: ensure everyone feels comfortable expressing their thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment. Initiate the conversation with a neutral tone and encourage honest exchanges.\n\n  * \ud83d\udd27 Separation of Duties: in my experience, precise separation of duties and ensuring everyone has clear boundaries and responsibilities can avoid many conflicts in a team.\n\n  * \ud83d\udcda Focus on Learning: every conflict presents an opportunity to learn something new about your team and its dynamics. Encourage everyone to view conflicts as chances for improvement rather than setbacks.\n\n  * \u2714\ufe0f Follow Through: after reaching a resolution, continue monitoring the situation to ensure that agreements are upheld and the underlying issues are truly resolved. This follow-through will help prevent the conflict from reoccurring.\n\nBy integrating these practices, you can turn conflicts into opportunities for\nteam development and deeper understanding among members.\n\n##\n\n\ud83d\udce2 Weekly Shoutouts\n\n  * An Optimized WFH Setup by\n\nRyan Peterman\n\n  * The Top 10 Lessons from our Podcast Guests by\n\nLuca Rossi\n\n  * How to prevent burning out in the engineering industry by\n\nGregor Ojstersek\n\n  * 3 Critical Skills You Need to Grow Beyond Senior Levels in Engineering by\n\nIrina Stanescu\n\n  * Ground Rules of Fairness at Work by\n\nMicha\u0142 Poczwardowski\n\n  * How I Upgraded My Conflict Resolution Skills by\n\nAkash Mukherjee\n\n##\n\n\u270c\ufe0f That\u2019s all folks\n\nThat's all for today!
