All currently known enantioconvergent processes\nnecessitate the loss or partial loss of the racemic substrate\u2019s stereochemical\ninformation, thus limiting the potential substrate scope to molecules that\ncontain labile stereogenic units. Here we present an alternative approach to\nenantioconvergent reactions that can proceed with full retention of the\nracemic substrate\u2019s configuration. This uniquely stereo-economic approach is\npossible if the two enantiomers of a racemic starting material are joined\ntogether to form one enantiomer of a non-meso product. Experimental validation\nof this concept is presented using two distinct strategies: (1) a direct\nasymmetric coupling approach, and (2) a multicomponent approach, which\nexhibits statistical amplification of enantiopurity. Thus, the established\ndogma that enantioconvergent reactions require substrates that contain labile\nstereogenic units is shown to be incorrect.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### A general strategy for the amination of electron-rich and electron-poor\nheteroaromatics by desaturative catalysis\n\nArticle 23 April 2024\n\n### Stereoselective amino acid synthesis by photobiocatalytic oxidative\ncoupling\n\nArticle 01 May 2024\n\n### Computationally guided synthesis of a hierarchical [4[2+3]+6] porous\norganic \u2018cage of cages\u2019\n\nArticle Open access 26 April 2024\n\n## Main\n\nFrom medicine to materials science^1,2, the ability to control the absolute\nconfiguration of chiral molecules is vital to controlling their function (Fig.\n1a). Since Pasteur\u2019s seminal work on the chiral resolution of racemic\ntartrates^3, scientists have sought out new ways to access chiral molecules in\nenantioenriched form. The stereoselective synthesis of chiral molecules in\nenantioenriched form, known as asymmetric synthesis, has been a great success\nfor the discipline of synthetic organic chemistry. The importance of\nasymmetric synthesis was recognized in 2001 when the Nobel Prize in Chemistry\nwas awarded to Knowles, Noyori and Sharpless for their development of metal-\ncatalysed asymmetric reactions. The field has remained an innovative and\nvibrant area of research, with the 2021 Nobel Prize in Chemistry awarded to\nList and MacMillan for their development of organocatalysed asymmetric\nreactions. Indeed, asymmetric reactions are now routine, both in industrial\nand academic settings, with a wide variety of catalysts available, from\nintricate precious-metal complexes to bespoke engineered enzymes.\n\nFig. 1: Chiral molecules, resolution reactions and enantioconvergent\nreactions.\n\na, Examples of chiral molecules in which the absolute configuration is\ncritical to their function. b, Resolution reactions, which are inherently\nlimited to a maximum 50% yield (A is starting material, R* is a chiral\nreagent, P is product). c, Established approaches to achieving\nenantioconvergent reactions (A is starting material, B is an intermediate, P\nis product). d, A stereoretentive approach to enantioconvergent reactions (A\nis starting material, AA is a chiral non-meso product). e, Stereoretentive\nenantioconvergent heterochiral dimerization. f, Stereoretentive\nenantioconvergent multicomponent reaction using an unsymmetrical linker\nmolecule (represented as \u25d1).\n\nFull size image\n\nThe approach taken in an asymmetric synthesis is dictated by the\nstereochemical nature of the starting material. When starting from an achiral\nsubstrate an enantioselective reaction can be used to access a new chiral\nproduct in up to 100% e.e. and 100% yield. Asymmetric synthesis using racemic\nsubstrates can be achieved through resolution reactions (for example, kinetic\nresolutions^4,5), wherein one enantiomer of the starting material is converted\ninto a new product (Fig. 1b). This unfortunately results in a maximum\nachievable yield of 50%, which represents a notable weakness in contemporary\nasymmetric synthesis. Enantioconvergent reactions, on the other hand, can be\nused to achieve full conversion of both enantiomers of a racemic starting\nmaterial into a single enantioenriched product in up to 100% e.e. and 100%\nyield^6,7,8. An increasing number of enantioconvergent reactions have been\ndeveloped in recent years, but they all rely on just three conceptual\napproaches for achieving enantioconvergency: stereomutation, stereoablation\nand stereodiscordance (Fig. 1c). Stereomutation involves the mutation (that\nis, interconversion) of the configuration of the racemic starting materials\u2019\nstereogenic unit(s)^6,7,8, and is most commonly associated with \u2018dynamic\nkinetic resolutions\u2019^9,10,11,12. In stereoablative processes^6,7,8,13, such as\ntype II dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformations^14, the stereogenic units\nin both enantiomers of the racemic starting material are ablated (that is,\ndestroyed), thus generating a common intermediate that undergoes a\nstereoselective transformation to give an enantioenriched product. In\nstereodiscordant processes (a terminology we introduce here for the first\ntime), such as \u2018enantioconvergent parallel kinetic resolutions\u2019^15,16, one\nenantiomer undergoes a stereoinversion process whilst the other enantiomer\nproceeds with stereoretention.\n\nAlthough each of these three established approaches have their own particular\nadvantages and challenges (Fig. 1c), they are all limited to racemic\nsubstrates that contain labile stereogenic units. This is because they all\nnecessitate the loss, or partial loss, of stereochemical information during\nthe reaction, either by mutation, ablation or partial inversion. Furthermore,\nsubstrates containing multiple stereogenic units are not generally amenable to\nany of these established approaches unless, for example, the substrate is\npseudosymmetric^14,17. Thus, the only currently available option for\nasymmetric synthesis using racemic substrates that contain robust and/or\nmultiple stereogenic units is to use inherently wasteful resolution reactions\n(Fig. 1b).\n\nWe realized that the configuration of a racemic substrate could be fully\nretained during an enantioconvergent reaction if the two enantiomers of a\nracemic substrate were coupled together to form one enantiomer of a non-meso\nproduct (Fig. 1d). We herein provide experimental validation of this\nstereoretentive approach to enantioconvergent reactions using two distinct\nstrategies. First, we describe a direct asymmetric coupling approach, wherein\na heterochiral dimer of a racemic substrate is produced in enantioenriched\nform (Fig. 1e). Second, we disclose a multicomponent approach that uses an\nunsymmetrical linker to ensure the final product is chiral (that is, non-meso)\n(Fig. 1f).\n\n## Results and discussion\n\n### Direct coupling approach\n\nDimerizations of racemic substrates are intrinsically more complex than those\ninvolving achiral or enantiopure substrates because of the issue of\nhomochiral\u2013heterochiral selectivity. That is, one enantiomer of a racemic\nsubstrate may react with another molecule of the same configuration\n(homochiral dimerization) or opposite configuration (heterochiral\ndimerization). If the selectivity of such a dimerization could be controlled\nto be both heterochiral-selective and enantioselective, then a stereoretentive\nenantioconvergent reaction would be realized (Fig. 1e). The aza-Darzens\nreaction was selected as a model dimerization to experimentally validate\nstereoretention as a viable concept for enantioconvergent reactions^18 (Fig.\n2). In 2001, W\u00fcrthwein, Fr\u00f6hlich and Alickmann reported that treatment of\nracemic imine epoxide 1 with LDA or LDA/KOt-Bu resulted in an exquisitely\nheterochiral-selective aza-Darzens dimerization to give racemic aziridine 2\n(Fig. 2a)^19. The inherent heterochiral selectivity of this reaction was\npostulated to be a result of a bis-lithium, cationic Zimmerman\u2013Traxler type\ntransition state 3 for the addition step, with density functional theory\ncalculations (B3LYP/6-31G*) revealing a 6.8 kcal mol^\u20131 preference for the\nheterochiral combination^19. We aimed to render this process enantioconvergent\nby replacing the achiral base with an enantiopure chiral base. Aziridine 2 was\nsuccessfully formed in enantioenriched form when using a number of different\nchiral lithium amides at \u221280 \u00b0C (Fig. 2c; for full details, see Supplementary\nFig. 1). The C_2-symmetric base 4 provided the highest enantioselectivity (60%\ne.e. at \u221280 \u00b0C)^20, which could be improved by lowering the reaction\ntemperature to \u2212100 \u00b0C to give aziridine 2 in 56% isolated yield and 92% e.e.\n(Fig. 2b). This represents the asymmetric synthesis of a highly substituted\naziridine but more importantly constitutes an enantioconvergent reaction that\nproceeds with stereoretention. The benefits in terms of stereo-economy are\nclear; three of the four stereogenic units in the racemic imine epoxide 1 are\nfully retained in the enantioenriched aziridine 2. A new stereogenic centre is\nalso created during the intermolecular addition step, which compensates for\nthe one lost in the final epoxide ring-opening step.\n\nFig. 2: Development of a stereoretentive enantioconvergent reaction.\n\na, A known heterochiral selective, but not enantioconvergent, aza-Darzens\ndimerization of racemic imine epoxide 1, as reported by W\u00fcrthwein and co-\nworkers^19. b, An enantioconvergent aza-Darzens reaction achieved using chiral\nlithium amide 4. The heterochiral selectivity was rationalized as a result of\na bis-lithium, cationic Zimmerman\u2013Traxler-type transition state 3 for the\naddition step^19. c, Results obtained when using other chiral lithium amides.\n\nFull size image\n\n### Multicomponent approach\n\nHaving realized our first goal of achieving a direct stereoretentive\nenantioconvergent coupling of a racemic substrate, we next turned our\nattention to demonstrating the concept of stereoretention in multicomponent\nenantioconvergent reactions (Fig. 1f). In this approach (Fig. 3), an\nunsymmetrical linker molecule (represented as \u25d1) provides a general and\npredictable approach to achieving heterochiral selectivity, whilst ensuring\nthe final heterochiral product 7 is chiral (that is, non-meso). The envisaged\nprocess begins with a kinetic resolution (KR) of the racemic starting material\n5 with the linker \u25d1, giving an enantioenriched intermediate 6 and resolved\nstarting material 5 (Fig. 3a). These are then coupled together to form the\ntarget heterochiral species 7 as the major product, alongside minor quantities\nof the homochiral product 8. Importantly, this coupling step will lead to\nstatistical amplification of enantiopurity (that is, the Horeau principle^21),\nmeaning that even when using a moderately selective KR the final product 7\nwill be formed in exceptionally high enantiopurity^22,23,24. Kinetic modelling\nof this multicomponent process illustrates how impressive this amplification\nof enantiopurity will be^25 (Fig. 3a\u2013c). In Fig. 3b, the calculated e.e. of\nthe intermediate 6 (at 50% conversion) and the e.e. of the final product 7 (at\n100% conversion) are plotted against the selectivity factor, s =\nk_1(S)/k_1(R), of the initial KR (note: s factors are often known as E values\nfor biocatalytic KR)^26. The enantioamplification is substantial; for example,\nin Fig. 3a the expected results are shown for a low s-factor of 8 in the\ninitial KR (note: s < 15 low; 15 < s < 30 acceptable; 30 < s < 50 good; s > 50\nexcellent). In a normal KR an s-factor of 8 would produce intermediate 6 in\njust 62% e.e. (at 50% conversion), whereas in this enantioconvergent process\nthe final product 7 will be formed in 90% e.e. (at 100% conversion). Thus, the\ndemands for achieving selectivity in the initial KR are remarkably low,\nmeaning the labour-intensive reaction/catalyst optimization process usually\nassociated with developing new asymmetric transformations can be largely\navoided^27,28,29. This statistical amplification of enantiopurity has strong\nparallels to the original studies reported by Horeau and co-workers in 1973^21\n(Fig. 3d), but it is different. Horeau\u2019s seminal work demonstrated that\nstatistical amplification of enantiopurity could be achieved by coupling\nenantioenriched samples with symmetrical linkers to give homochiral dimers in\namplified enantiopurity, which comes at the cost of forming small amounts of\nthe meso-heterochiral dimers (see example in Fig. 3d). Whereas, in our\nmulticomponent reactions, unsymmetrical linkers are used in stereoselective\nprocesses to give the heterochiral dimers in amplified enantiopurity at the\ncost of forming small amounts of the unwanted homochiral dimers (Fig. 3a).\n\nFig. 3: Kinetic modelling for multicomponent stereoretentive enantioconvergent\nreactions.\n\na, Envisaged reaction manifold for a multicomponent stereoretentive\nenantioconvergent reaction, using an asymmetric linker molecule (\u25d1), with\nexample of statistical amplification of enantiopurity for a poorly selective\ninitial KR (s = 8). b, Statistical amplification of enantiopurity (that is,\nHoreau amplification) over a representative range of selectivity factors in\nthe initial KR (1 < s < 100). c, Parameters used for the kinetic modelling:\n(1) simple second-order kinetics for both steps; (2) the coupling step is much\nslower than the initial KR (k_1 \u226b k_2); and (3) there is no asymmetric\ninduction in the second step (k_2-hetero = k_2-homo). More complex reaction\nkinetics and/or asymmetric induction in the second step could result in\nstereoisomeric ratios different from those predicted. Full details of the\nkinetic modelling are described in section 7 of the Supplementary Information.\nd, One of Horeau\u2019s original reactions exhibiting statistical amplification of\nenantiopurity.\n\nFull size image\n\nKR by acylation, which is a common method in asymmetric synthesis^30, was\nselected as a model system with which to develop multicomponent\nstereoretentive enantioconvergent processes (Fig. 4). Bode and co-workers have\nreported the KR of racemic amines using acylated chiral hydroxamic acid\nreagents^31,32. We designed an analogous chloroacetylated reagent 9, so that\nthat the intermediate from the KR would be a chloroacetamide, 10, rather than\na simple acetamide, which could undergo a final coupling with the remaining\namine 11 via nucleophilic substitution. The impact of having the \u03b1-chloro\nsubstituent on reagent 9 was investigated for the KR of racemic\ntetrahydroisoquinoline 11. Thankfully, the \u03b1-chloro substituent was found to\nbe well tolerated and resulted in an acceptable s-factor of 28, which at a\nperfect 50% conversion would give chloroacetamide 10 in 83% e.e. A\nmulticomponent stereoretentive enantioconvergent reaction was achieved by\nfirst conducting a KR of racemic tetrahydroisoquinoline 11 with our \u03b1-chloro-\nBode reagent 9 in tetrahydrofuran at room temperature. Once the KR was\ncomplete, the reaction temperature was increased to 50 \u00b0C and triethylamine\nand NaI were added to facilitate the final nucleophilic substitution. This\ngives the target \u03b1-aminoamide 12 in an amplified enantiopurity of 97% e.e.\n(Fig. 4a; for full details, see section 3 of the Supplementary Information).\nThis reaction, alongside the aza-Darzens dimerization (Fig. 2), experimentally\nvalidate stereoretention as a viable concept for enantioconvergent reactions.\nThese conceptually ground-breaking reactions were achieved via stoichiometric\nreagent-controlled stereoselectivity, that is, a super-stoichiometric chiral\nreagent and a traceless chiral auxiliary. Our attention next turned to\ndemonstrating the concept of stereoretention in enantioconvergent reactions\nusing asymmetric catalysis.\n\nFig. 4: Multicomponent stereoretentive enantioconvergent reactions.\n\na, Enantioconvergent reaction starting from racemic tetrahydroisoquinoline 11\nusing a Bode-type acylating reagent 9.

A\nbiocatalytic KR of racemic amine 13 using ethyl chloroacetate as the linker\ngives both chloroacetamide 14 and recovered amine 13 in highly enantioenriched\nform (96% e.e. and 99% e.e., respectively)^34. Filtration to remove the\nbiocatalyst and molecular sieves followed by evaporative removal of the\nsolvent and excess ethyl chloroacetate gives a clean mixture of\nchloroacetamide 14 and recovered amine 13. These are then coupled together\nthrough a nucleophilic substitution reaction, using NaHCO_3 and catalytic KI,\nto give \u03b1-aminoamide 15 in 65% yield over the two steps. Owing to the highly\nselective nature of the biocatalytic KR, the final product 15 is formed in\nnear enantiopure form (99.99% e.e.), with only trace quantities of the\nunwanted homochiral product present (d.r. 33:1) (Fig. 4b).\n\nFor these multicomponent reactions the design of the linker is very important\nand must satisfy a number of criteria. Most importantly, it must allow for a\nhighly site-selective KR of the racemic substrate whilst containing an\northogonal reactive site for the subsequent statistical coupling. For\nreactions based on acylative KR of amines the inclusion of an \u03b1-electrophilic\nsite worked very well in terms of reactivity and selectivity (Fig. 4a,b). For\nreactions based on the acylative KR of alcohols, however, this linker design\ndid not work well owing to transesterification competing with the desired\nnucleophilic substitution. Therefore, 2,2-dimethylglutaric anhydride 16 was\nused as a highly site-selective acylating reagent for the organocatalytic KR\nof racemic secondary alcohol 17, using the bifunctional cinchona-thiourea\ncatalyst 18^35. The free carboxylic acid in intermediate 19 then served very\nwell as an orthogonal reactive site for a subsequent modified-Shiina\nesterification^36, to give diester 20 in 65% yield over the two steps in good\nheterochiral selectivity (d.r. 5:1) and amplified enantiopurity (98% e.e.).\n\n### Diastereoconvergent approach\n\nWe were curious to explore the potential benefits of using chiral enantiopure\nlinkers in multicomponent diastereoconvergent processes. Specifically, we were\ninterested in trying to identify and leverage triple-stereodifferentiation\neffects to boost selectivity (that is, higher-order matched\u2013mismatched\neffects)^37. Traditional KRs are examples of double stereodifferentiating\nreactions, where the reaction outcome depends on the absolute configuration of\nthe two participants (for example, the substrate and the catalyst)^4,5. By\nusing a chiral enantiopure linker the outcome of our initial KR will now\ndepend to some extent on the absolute configuration of all three participants.\nTo see if triple stereodifferentiation might be observable, and therefore\npotentially useful, we selected the KR of racemic amino acid\nN-carboxyanhydrides with alcohols as a suitable reaction manifold^38 (Fig. 5).\nPropylene glycol 22, which is commercially available in both enantiomeric\nforms, was selected as a model chiral linker as it satisfies the design\nrequirements already outlined above; the primary alcohol can serve as the most\nreactive site for the KR and the secondary alcohol can then serve as the\nreactive site for the final nucleophilic acyl substitution coupling (Fig. 5).\nThus, two reactions using (DHQD)_2AQN as catalyst were performed on racemic\nphenylalanine N-carboxyanhydride 23, with (S)-propylene glycol 22 used in one\nreaction and (R)-propylene glycol 22 used in the other. After 24 h at \u221240 \u00b0C\nwe observed a pronounced difference in selectivity between the initial kinetic\nresolutions, with (S)-propylene glycol 22 identified as the \u2018matched\u2019\nstereodifferentiating linker. Both reactions were then allowed to warm to room\ntemperature and DMAP added to catalyse the final nucleophilic acyl\nsubstitution. When (R)-propylene glycol 22 was used as the linker, product 24\nwas obtained in a poor heterochiral\u2013homochiral ratio of 1.4:1 with the desired\nheterochiral adduct formed in just 66% d.e. In comparison, when using\n(S)-propylene glycol 22, the final product 25 was formed in a\nheterochiral\u2013homochiral ratio of 3.2:1 with the heterochiral adduct formed in\n93% d.e. (Fig. 5).\n\nFig. 5: Investigating triple-stereodifferentiation effects in multicomponent\ndiastereoconvergent reactions using enantiopure linkers.\n\nIdentification of a triple-stereodifferentiation effect using\n(R)/(S)-propylene glycol 22 as the asymmetric linker in a diastereoconvergent\nreaction of racemic phenylalanine N-carboxyanhydride 23 using (DHQD)_2AQN as\ncatalyst. DMAP, 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine; Et_2O, diethyl ether. ^ae.e. values\nwere determined from the corresponding methyl esters, after hydrolysis and\nmethylation using KHCO_3 and CH_3I; for full details, see section 5 of the\nSupplementary Information.\n\nFull size image\n\n## Conclusion and outlook\n\nThe results presented in this report experimentally validate stereoretention\nas a conceptually different and complementary approach to achieving\nenantioconvergency. This concept can now be exploited by others to develop new\nstereoconvergent methodology which, for the first time, can utilize racemic\nsubstrates with robust and multiple stereogenic units. Controlling the many\naspects of reactivity and selectivity needed for these processes stands as an\nexciting new challenge for the synthetic chemistry community. Addressing these\nchallenges will allow for a substantial expansion of our collective toolbox of\nstereoconvergent methods, which has the potential to impact all areas of\nscience in which the configuration of chiral molecules is important for their\nfunction^1,2.\n\n## Data availability\n\nAll data to support the conclusions are available in the Supplementary\nInformation.\n\n## Change history\n\n  * ### 30 May 2024\n\nIn the version of this article initially published, the lower dashed arrow now\nshown in Fig. 1a \u201cstereodiscordance approach\u201d originally appeared as a solid\narrow, and is now amended in the HTML and PDF versions of the article.\n\n## References\n\n  1.
