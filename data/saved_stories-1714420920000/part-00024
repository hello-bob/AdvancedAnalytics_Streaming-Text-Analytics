It\nalso requires third party service providers to vendors of PHRs and PHR related\nentities to notify such vendors and PHR related entities following the\ndiscovery of a breach.\n\n\u201cProtecting consumers\u2019 sensitive health data is a high priority for the FTC,\u201d\nsaid Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection. \u201cWith\nthe increasing use of health apps and connected devices, the updated HBNR will\nensure it keeps pace with changes in the health marketplace.\u201d\n\nIn May 2023, the FTC sought comment on proposed changes to the HBNR. After\nreceiving approximately 120 comments from a broad range of individuals and\nstakeholders, the Commission has finalized changes to the rule, including:\n\n  * Revising definitions: The Commission revised several definitions to underscore the final rule\u2019s application to health apps and similar technologies not covered by HIPAA. This includes modifying the definition of \u201cPHR identifiable health information\u201d and adding two new definitions for \u201ccovered health care provider\u201d and \u201chealth care services or supplies\u201d;\n  * Clarifying breach of security: It clarifies that a \u201cbreach of security\u201d under the final rule includes an unauthorized acquisition of identifiable health information that occurs as a result of a data security breach or an unauthorized disclosure;\n  * Revising definition of PHR related entity: The definition of \u201cPHR related entity\u201d has been revised in two ways that pertain to the rule\u2019s scope. The revised definition makes clear that the final rule covers entities that offer products and services through the online services, including mobile applications, of vendors of personal health records. It also makes clear that only entities that access or send unsecured PHR identifiable health information to a personal health record \u2014 rather than entities that access or send any information to a personal health record \u2014 qualify as PHR related entities;\n  * Clarifying multiple sources of PHR identifiable health information: The final rule clarifies what it means for a personal health record to draw PHR identifiable health information from multiple sources;\n  * Expanding use of electronic notification: The final rule authorizes the expanded use of email and other electronic means of providing clear and effective notice to consumers of a breach;\n  * Expanding consumer notice content: The final rule expands the required content that must be provided in the notice to consumers. For example, the notice would be required to include the name or identity (or, where providing the full name or identity would pose a risk to individuals or the entity providing notice, a description) of any third parties that acquired unsecured PHR identifiable health information as a result of a breach of security;\n  * Changing timing requirement: The final rule modifies when the FTC must be notified under the rule. For breaches involving 500 or more individuals, covered entities must notify the FTC at the same time they send notices to affected individuals, which must occur without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after the discovery of a breach of security; and\n  * Improving readability: The final rule also includes changes to improve the rule\u2019s readability and promote compliance.\n\nThe final rule will go into effect 60 days after its publication in the\nFederal Register.\n\nIn addition to amending the HBNR, the FTC has recently taken action against\ncompanies for violating the HBNR, including GoodRx and Easy Healthcare\n(publisher of the Premom app).\n\nThe Commission voted 3-2 to approve the publication of the final rule in the\nFederal Register with Commissioners Melissa Holyoak and Andrew N. Ferguson\nvoting no. Chair Lina M. Khan along with Commissioners Rebecca Kelly Slaughter\nand Alvaro Bedoya issued a separate statement, while Commissioner Holyoak,\njoined by Commissioner Ferguson, issued a dissenting statement.\n\nThe lead staffers who worked on this rule include Ryan Mehm and Ronnie Solomon\nwith the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission works to promote competition and protect and\neducate consumers. The FTC will never demand money, make threats, tell you to\ntransfer money, or promise you a prize.
