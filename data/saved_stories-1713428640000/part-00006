Why\ndo we need another REST Client? I\u2019ve seen variations of this question many\ntimes since launch, so I thought it\u2019d be a great topic to kick off the blog.\n\n## \ud83d\udcab The tools can still be better\n\nLet me start by introducing myself. My name is Greg and I launched Insomnia in\n2014 (under the initial name Bodybuilder \ud83d\ude05) because I needed to interact with\nthe APIs I was building at work and found existing tools to be bloated and\nhard to use.\n\nWith the help of the Chrome Web Store (now defunct), my little side project\ngained a few thousand organic users in the first year, which was enough to\nconvince me to pursue it full time. I added a paid plan, released it as open-\nsource, and eventually grew revenue to $20k/month in 2019 as a solo founder.\nObjectively, it was a huge success...\n\nbut I was totally burnt out \ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\udca8\n\nAfter five years of grinding, I accepted an acquisition offer because I was\ndrowning in support tickets (mostly related to technical debt) and open-source\ndiscussions (mostly saying \u201cno\u201d to new features) and couldn\u2019t see myself\nsticking with it for much longer. I\u2019d dug myself into an unsustainable hole\nand an acquisition was an easy escape.\n\nThe combination of burnout and a 9-5 job wasn\u2019t for me. I needed a break and\nwanted to explore new creative ideas, so I made the tough decision to cut my\nacquisition term short and return to self employment. About six months after\nthis transition I discovered Railway, fell in love, and joined as an early\nengineer. I was building cool stuff again, but just like before I found myself\nin need of an API client.\n\nInsomnia was still my app of choice at the time but it was steadily drifting\nfrom my initial vision. It transformed from a simple API client to a do-it-all\ntool for designing, debugging, and testing APIs at big-company scale. The\nonce-simple app was now full of features I\u2019d never use, just cluttering the\nexperience. It was time for me to find a new tool.\n\nI tried them all, but every tool left me wanting more. It was 2014 all over\nagain.\n\n## \ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udcbb An API client for me\n\nSome time later I found myself driving back from a 20-hour road trip alone\u2014due\nto vehicle troubles\u2014with an empty podcast queue. I spent the trip reflecting\non difficult questions; could I build a better app? Was open-source worth it?\nCould I have avoided burnout? Is it worth trying again?\n\nThe thought disappeared after settling back into my daily routine, until a\ncoworker shared Tauri\u2014a cross-platform framework for building desktop apps\nwith web technology and Rust. I was excited to try it but couldn\u2019t think of\nanything to build... I\u2019m sure you can guess what happened next.\n\nI spent a day making a very bare bones proof-of-concept, and Yaak was born.\n\nInitial prototype to test sending a single request\n\nI kept working on it, getting more excited as things took shape, until I was\nspending upwards of 30 hours per week outside my day job. Before work, after\nwork, during lunch, on weekends. I would lay in bed for hours at night writing\nthoughts in my journal. * Calling it an obsession would be an understatement.*\nI knew exactly what to build and sprinted towards the finish.\n\nFirst release shared with friends\n\n## \ud83d\udea2 Deciding to ship\n\nAfter a month of work I sent an early release to friends and coworkers while\ncontinuing to tinker in my spare time. I was happy to finally have a tool I\nenjoyed using but still wasn\u2019t considering a public release, until a handful\nof Insomnia\u2019s actions changed my mind.\n\nThe first was adding a persistent GitHub stars widget, taking up valuable\nreal-estate for no user benefit. It was a small thing, but it made clear a\nshift toward valuing growth above user experience. I was frustrated but there\nwas nothing I could do.\n\nMore recently, Insomnia forced users to create an account to use the app. This\none really hit hard because one of the reasons I started Insomnia was because\nother apps in the space did exactly this.\n\nUsers can tell when they\u2019re not valued, and it feels like shit. This was the\nfirst time I felt like the acquisition was a mistake.\n\nTweet showing my initial reaction\n\nThe app I poured 7 years of my life into was now trading its user loyalty for\nmeaningless GitHub stars. The community was outraged [1] [2] and it was my\nfault.\n\nThat\u2019s when the switch flipped in my head. It was time to ship Yaak as a\nroundabout way of making things right, so I put in another month of work to\nget a release ready for the public, and announced it.\n\n## \ud83d\udc40 What the future holds\n\nMy goal for the launch was to get enough traction to see if it resonated, and\nthat definitely happened. The launch was modest, only bringing in a few\nhundred active users, but people have been submitting to the roadmap and even\ndoing weird things like cloning the app and making themes. The signal is high.\nI\u2019m doing something right, but need to get it in front of more people.\n\nApp stats since Twitter announcement\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned over the years, it\u2019s that success takes time\nand is 95% luck. All of Insomnia\u2019s growth can be attributed to a handful of\nlucky breaks, so I\u2019m sticking with a simple strategy for now.\n\n  * Build out the Roadmap using community feedback\n  * Focus on upcoming core features like Websocket and plugin system\n  * Continue sharing my story in posts like this\n\nI\u2019m not sure where Yaak is headed, but I\u2019m excited to find out. Worst case, I\nhave the exact tool I want to use, and that\u2019s a win in my book.\n\nBuilding great products is a collaborative process, so please take Yaak for a\nspin and submit your thoughts. Or, if there are any topics you\u2019d like to see\ncovered on this blog, let me know on Twitter/X. I\u2019m always excited to share!\n\nSee you soon \ud83d\udc4b\n\n", "frontpage": false}
