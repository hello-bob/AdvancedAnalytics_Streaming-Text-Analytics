In Greenland some said the lights\nwere the spirits of children who had died at birth but were now dancing in the\nheavens. Others said they were made by spirits playing ball with the skull of\na walrus\u2014or by walrus spirits kicking around human skulls. To the Algonquin\npeople of eastern Canada, the lights were the reflection of fires lit by their\ncreator, Nanabozho, to remind them that they are in his thoughts. In Finland\nthey are still known as \u201cfox fires\u201d after a mythical fox whose tail sparks\ncolorful flames in the sky as he runs across a snowy landscape.\n\n> According to legend, if you return the whistle the light might come nearer\n> and even dance for you.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nA scientific account of auroras links our imaginations to the vastness of\nspace and the irreducible strangeness of matter. They occur when charged\nparticles of the solar wind streaming across tens of millions of miles of\nempty space from the sun are drawn down along the lines of the Earth\u2019s\nmagnetic field where it is nearly vertical at the poles. Here, 100 kilometers\n(62 miles) or so above our heads, the particles excite air molecules which\nthen shed their excess energy in the form of light: green or red for oxygen,\nblue or purple for nitrogen.\n\nMore puzzling are reports of the aurora making sounds. The explorer Knud\nRasmussen wrote in the early 20th century that the Inuit sometimes heard\nwhistling, rustling, and other sounds as it played across the sky. According\nto their legends, he added, if you returned the whistle the light might come\nnearer and even dance for you. Some Europeans reported hearing the noises,\ntoo. In an account of travels in Lapland published in 1827, the naturalist Sir\nArthur de Capell Brooke described one such occasion. \u201cThe lights were ... very\nbright and exceptionally fast in motion ... The night was perfectly calm and\nquiet and I thought I heard a crackling sound ... coming from [their]\ndirection.\u201d Other accounts over the years compare the noise to the swish or\nrustle of a silken skirt, the sizzle of bacon in a hot pan, a flock of birds,\nand even to the crack of a rifle being fired.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

Auroras occur far\ntoo high up for any sounds they might make to be audible on the ground, so\nthere could be no sound. But in 1990 a young acoustic scientist had an\nexperience that helped change that. Taking a break during a jazz festival in\nthe far north of Finland, scientist Unto Laine and a friend stepped out into\nthe cold night air. In the remote location and with no wind they expected\nalmost complete silence, but instead heard a hissing noise above their heads\nthat seemed to fluctuate with the movements of an aurora.\n\nSNAP, CRACKLE, BANG: The myth of the northern lights speaking to us may well\nbe true. Unto Laine, a Finnish acoustic researcher, caught the celestial\nsounds many believe are made by the aurora borealis in the recording here. The\nvideo includes diagrams of how they might be produced. Credit: Aalto\nUniversity / YouTube.\n\nLaine half-forgot the experience but when he returned to the festival in 1999\nand heard the same sounds again, he decided to investigate. After dozens more\nobservations, and after making the first recording of the elusive sounds in\n2012, Laine thinks he can explain what is going on. The noise that can be\nheard on the ground, he says, is caused by a corona discharge\u2014the same\nphenomenon that can create a blue glow around high-voltage electrical\nequipment such as a power line, and which is sometimes accompanied by a\nbuzzing sound.\n\nTo generate the voltages required, high positive and negative charges must\naccumulate close to each other. Laine reckons this can happen above our heads\non unusually cold evenings when the frozen ground cools the air immediately\nabove it. The cold air becomes trapped under a layer of warm air a few hundred\nmeters up at the base of what is known as the inversion layer. Negative ions\nclose to the ground rise up to this layer, but do not rise above it.\nMeanwhile, positive ions settle on its upper surface. This electric potential,\nalready significant, is increased further by the aurora, says Laine, to the\npoint where a sudden discharge happens, producing ultraviolet radiation,\nmagnetic field pulses, and sounds. All this is happening just a few tens or\nhundreds of meters above our heads\u2014far below the visible aurora itself.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

Occasionally, however, they can\nrise to around 60 decibels\u2014as loud as ordinary speech a few meters away. They\noccur most often when a geomagnetic storm is particularly strong and the air\nclose to the ground is still and very cold, but people often miss them, Laine\ntells me, because they are chatting or taking photos. \u201cOne has to listen very\ncarefully to hear them and to distinguish them from the ambient noise,\u201d he\nsays.\n\nOVER YOUR HEAD: Composer Sam Perkin wrote a piece he named \u201cAlta\u201d to\nmemorialize Laine\u2019s efforts to solve the mystery of the music of the Northern\nLights. The piece was performed for the first time in 2020 in the Northern\nLights Cathedral in Alta, Norway. Credit: Sam Perkin \u2013 Composer / YouTube.\n\nThe composer Sam Perkin has written a piece that portrays Laine\u2019s quest and\ndiscovery. In \u201cAlta for Two String Trios and Electronics,\u201c shimmering\nharmonies on the strings build slowly to a point when recordings of the\nauroral sounds break and crack over their surface like celestial percussion.\nThe piece was first performed early in 2020 in the Northern Lights Cathedral\nin Alta, Norway\u2014a building in which tall, slim, irregularly placed windows\nlight up the wall behind the altar in a way that resembles the aurora. The\nNorthern Lights\u2014\u201cthe drum taps of a solar storm upon the Earth\u201d\u2014were echoed in\nboth architecture and music.\n\nOthers, meanwhile, explore the sound worlds that can be created when the\nsoundless electromagnetic waves of the aurora itself are transformed through a\nsynthesizer into analogues that we can hear. The results resemble whistling\nwhales, calling frogs, and the twittering of strange birds. \u201cWhen they\u2019re very\nprominent, you\u2019ll hear this sweeping frequency from high to low or low to\nhigh,\u201d says the sound artist Matthew Burtner, who has used the sounds to\ncreate a piece titled \u201cAuroras.\u201d \u201cYou really feel like you\u2019re in touch with\nthe solar system.\u201d\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.
