Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n# US sanctions transform China into legacy chip production juggernaut \u2014\nproduction jumped 40% in Q1 2024\n\nNews\n\nBy Aaron Klotz\n\npublished yesterday\n\nThe U.S. purposefully excluded older chips from its export sanctions.\n\n(Image credit: HLMC)\n\nU.S. semiconductor export sanctions could be backfiring: China's output of\nlegacy semiconductor chips grew by a whopping 40% in the first quarter of\n2024, according to a report from SCMP. The massive surge in production\nsuggests China could become the global leader in legacy chip production.\n\nA big reason for the surge: There are no trade restrictions on 'mature chips,'\nor chips that utilize 28nm or older process technology. The U.S. government\npurposefully left these chips out of its sanctions to ensure supply chain\nresistance; these older chips are used extensively in a range of important\ndevices, such as cars and basic electronics (e.g. toasters, phones, and\nmedical equipment), and disrupting the supply chain could cause global issues.\nAlso, the U.S. government determined that these chips do not pose a threat to\nnational security (at least, not in the way newer chips do).\n\nAs a result, China's national semiconductor output of legacy chips reached an\nall-time high, with 36.2 billion units produced in March alone. Reports claim\nthat China's output over the past three months is almost three times what it\nproduced in Q1 2019, which was when China started implementing its plan to\nbring chip production back in-house.\n\nThanks to U.S. sanctions, most new Chinese investments have focused on mature\nsemiconductors rather than bleeding-edge semiconductor nodes. Heavy state-wide\nbacking has also assisted and is believed to be the main proponent driving\nChina's huge production gains \u2014 to the point where China is overproducing\nchips.\n\nLATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware\n\nAt this rate, China is headed toward global dominance of legacy chip\nproduction, according to reports. China's mature-process production capacity\nis expected to reach 39% of global market share by 2027 \u2014 up from 31% last\nyear.\n\nThis trend could continue beyond 2027 if the U.S. continues to enforce its\ncurrent regulations. China has had no choice but to produce chips using older\nprocess technologies, as it has no mainstream method of competing with\ncompanies such as Intel and TSMC on bleeding-edge process nodes. China is\ndesperate to become self-sufficient, but it has no way of obtaining the proper\nlithography tools needed to build cutting-edge microchip processors.\n\nUltimately, China still relies heavily on chip imports (of the chips it can\nstill receive, that is). In fact, reports reveal that China's semiconductor\nimports have grown by 12.7% in Q1 2024, so it's not doing the best job at\npursuing self-sufficiency ... yet.\n\n## Stay on the Cutting Edge\n\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC\ntech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

In the case of Intel they were historically pretty\naggressive with this so I don't think they have any 200mm fabs left (this was\na driving force behind them wanting to buy Tower). It's not possible for a\ncompany to spin up a new old node fab so it's left to existing or government\nsubsidized and we can guess which this is.\n\nReply\n\n  * ivan_vy\n\nUSA prohibits cutting edge chips, China mass produce legacy chips and flood\nthe world markets. *surprised pikachu face basic economy of scale and the\nrevenue will fund R&D including eventually proper lithography tools. one might\nthink lawmakers don't know enough about economy and technology.\n\nReply\n\n  * Pierce2623\n\n> punkncat said:\n>\n> Demand drives production as well as innovation.

They just do IP theft.\n\nReply\n\n  * punkncat\n\n> Pierce2623 said:\n>\n> They just do IP theft.\n\nI sure won't fault you for that part of the statement.\n\nReply\n\n  * Pierce2623\n\n> ivan_vy said:\n>\n> USA prohibits cutting edge chips, China mass produce legacy chips and flood\n> the world markets. *surprised pikachu face basic economy of scale and the\n> revenue will fund R&D including eventually proper lithography tools. one\n> might think lawmakers don't know enough about economy and technology.\n\nIf China started a program today to build a 3nm node. It would take 10 years\nat least if they\u2019re trying to build their own lithography tools, too( which\nthey\u2019ll seemingly have to do to hit 3nm)\n\nReply\n\n  * williamcll\n\n> Pierce2623 said:\n>\n> It seems you missed the part of the article where they\u2019ve overproduced and\n> went beyond demand.\n\nOverproduction is a lie by bigger chip producers to gauge and inflate prices.\nThere's always a demand\n\nReply\n\n  * daris98\n\nPeople always underestimate the market scale of \"legacy chips\". TSMC has 32%\nof its money coming from the planar transistor business (28 nm or older) and\nconsidering the skyrocketing demands they had as the market leader on cutting\nedge nodes, that number is absolutely massive.\n\nHowever, as time goes by, the gap between legacy and cutting edge might either\nbe more and more prominent or will diminish. Critical computing\ninfrastructure, especially ones that needs brute forcing (AI for instance) is\nexpected to see a divergence, but we never know if that's ever true as someone\nmight come up with a workaround by using less transistors (though apparently\nunlikely). If true, we're not even sure if it's an ever growing trend either.\n\nOn the other hand, budget consumer electronics can stay at the 7 nm generation\nin a long time. Any computer with the 16 nm generation process is still deemed\nfast these days, in comparison to say what 32 nm was to 90 nm (e.g. Sandy\nBridge vs Prescott). The world should always be ready for China's slippery\nindustrial strategies.\n\nReply\n\n  * gg83\n\nIf not mature nodes, China would have put that money and more into bleeding\nedge. Either way China would have taken a percentage of global production.\nThis isn't worth an article. It's just an anti-sanction pro China propaganda\npeice.\n\nReply\n\n##### Most Popular\n\nAlleged cryptojacker arrested for money laundering, $3.5 million in cloud\nservice fraud \u2014 ultimately mined less than $1 million in crypto\n\nDetermined modder gets 'Halo 2' running at 720p on the original Xbox \u2014 after\ntweaks to the console hardware, kernel, and game\n\nChinese researchers use low-cost Nvidia chip for hypersonic weapon\n\u2014unrestricted Nvidia Jetson TX2i powers guidance system\n\nChatGPT can craft attacks based on chip vulnerabilities \u2014 GPT-4 model tested\nby UIUC computer scientists\n\nASRock reveals two new 27-inch 1440p IPS monitors, one with an integrated Wi-\nFi antenna in the stand\n\nPlayStation overlay is coming to PC alongside 'Ghost of Tsushima' port\n\nSamsung unveils 10.7Gbps LPDDR5X mobile memory optimized for AI applications\n\nASML sets density record with latest chipmaking tools \u2014 High-NA EUV equipment\nprints first patterns\n\nHigh-end AMD RDNA 2 supply is dwindling \u2014 RX 6950 XT, RX 6900 XT, RX 6800 XT\nvirtually out of stock\n\nTSMC powers parts of Taipei with backup generators \u2014 Taiwan requests help as\nblackouts begin\n\nRaspberry Pi FPV monitor shares drone flights in real time\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and\nleading digital publisher.
