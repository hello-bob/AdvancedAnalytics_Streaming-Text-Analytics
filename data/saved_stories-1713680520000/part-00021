They offered a handful of reasons for the cuts,\nincluding the fact that timelines for NASA's Artemis lunar missions that will\nuse the SLS rocket are slipping to the right.\n\nLater on Thursday, in a statement provided to Ars, a Boeing spokesperson\nconfirmed the cuts: \"Due to external factors unrelated to our program\nperformance, Boeing is reviewing and adjusting current staffing levels on the\nSpace Launch System program.\"\n\n## Better late than never?\n\nFor nearly a decade and a half, Boeing has led development of the core stage\nof the massive SLS rocket that NASA intends to use to launch the Orion\nspacecraft for its crewed Moon missions.\n\nThe contract has been lucrative for Boeing and subject to considerable\ncriticism over the years for its largesse, as NASA has spent tens of billions\nof dollars developing a rocket that reuses Space Shuttle main engines and\nother elements. Also, the rocket was originally supposed to make its debut in\nlate 2016 or 2017 but did not actually fly for the first time until November\n2022. And NASA's inspector general has characterized Boeing's management of\nthe SLS rocket program at times as \"poor.\"\n\nHowever, when the SLS rocket made its debut a year and a half ago, it\nperformed exceptionally well in lofting an uncrewed Orion spacecraft toward\nthe Moon. After that mission NASA declared the rocket to be \"operational,\" and\nBoeing moved into production of the vehicle for future missions that will\ncarry astronauts to the Moon.\n\nSo in some sense, these cuts were inevitable. Boeing required a lot of\nresources to design, develop, test, and write software for the rocket. Now\nthat the development phase is over, it is natural that the company would be\nscaling down development activities for the core stage.\n\nThe Boeing statement did not say so, but sources told Ars that the cuts may\neventually amount to hundreds of employees. They will be spread across the\ncompany's rocket facilities in Alabama, Louisiana, and Florida, primarily. The\ncuts will hit both the core stage program as well as the Exploration Upper\nStage program, a new upper stage for the rocket that is also beginning to move\nfrom development into production.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Waiting on other elements\n\nWhen Boeing cites \"external factors,\" it is referring to the slipping\ntimelines for NASA's Artemis Program. In January officials with the space\nagency announced approximately one-year delays for both the Artemis II\nmission, a crewed lunar flyby, to September 2025; and Artemis III, a lunar\nlanding, to September 2026. Neither of these schedules are set in stone,\neither. Further delays are possible for Artemis II, and likely for Artemis III\nif NASA sticks to the current mission plans.\n\nAlthough the SLS rocket will be ready for the current schedule, barring a\ncatastrophe, the other elements are in doubt. For Artemis II, NASA still has\nnot cleared a heat shield issue with the Orion spacecraft. That must be\nresolved before the mission gets a green light to proceed next year.\n\nThe challenges are even greater for Artemis III. For that mission NASA needs\nto have a lunar lander\u2014which is being provided by SpaceX with its Starship\nvehicle\u2014in addition to spacesuits provided by Axiom Space for the lunar\nsurface. Both of these elements remain solidly in the development phase.\n\nAdditionally, NASA is grappling with budget challenges. For the first time in\nmore than a decade, the agency is facing budget cuts. This week the space\nagency's administrator, Bill Nelson, told Congress, \"With less money, we have\nto make some very tough choices.\" Among these could be seeking to use future\nSLS funding to shore up other elements of Artemis.\n\nOne of the people familiar with Boeing's internal meeting on Thursday said the\nspace agency had come to the company earlier this year and said, in effect,\nthat Boeing would receive less funding as SLS development wound down. The\ncompany was given the choice to \"stretch\" the funding it would receive or\npause for a year due to the delays in the Artemis mission. Boeing chose to\nstretch the funds, and that was a driver of the cuts this week.\n\nIt would be easy, but unfair, to blame SpaceX and Axiom for the delays to\nfuture Artemis missions. Congress created the SLS rocket with an authorization\nbill back in 2010, but Boeing actually had been receiving funding for related\nwork dating back to 2007. By contrast, NASA did not start funding work on the\nStarship lunar lander until late 2021, and the Axiom spacesuits until 2022. In\nsome sense, these developments are as technically demanding as the SLS rocket\nwork, if not more so.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n96\n\nEric Berger Eric Berger is the senior space editor at Ars Technica, covering\neverything from astronomy to private space to wonky NASA policy, and author of\nthe book Liftoff, about the rise of SpaceX.
