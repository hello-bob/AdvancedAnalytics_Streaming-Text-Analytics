He will remain involved in and committed to this exciting\nproject until its completion.\n\nSince joining Red Bull Racing in 2006, Adrian\u2019s vision and technical\nleadership has been instrumental for the Team and Group in achieving a\nremarkable seven F1 Drivers\u2019 and six Constructors\u2019 Championship titles -\ntotalling 118 victories and 101 poles including the STR 2008 pole and victory.\n\nOracle Red Bull Racing Chief Technical Officer Adrian Newey said: \u201cEver since\nI was a young boy, I wanted to be a designer of fast cars. My dream was to be\nan engineer in Formula One, and I\u2019ve been lucky enough to make that dream a\nreality. For almost two decades it has been my great honour to have played a\nkey role in Red Bull Racing\u2019s progress from upstart newcomer to multiple\ntitle-winning Team. However, I feel now is an opportune moment to hand that\nbaton over to others and to seek new challenges for myself. In the interim,\nthe final stages of development of RB17 are upon us, so for the remainder of\nmy time with the Team my focus will lie there. I would like to thank the many\namazing people I have worked with at Red Bull in our journey over the last 18\nyears for their talent, dedication and hard work. It has been a real\nprivilege, and I am confident that the engineering Team are well prepared for\nthe work going into the final evolution of the car under the four-year period\nof this regulation set. On a personal note, I would also like to thank the\nshareholders, the late Dietrich Mateschitz, Mark Mateschitz and Chalerm\nYoovidhya for their unwavering support during my time at Red Bull, and\nChristian, who has not only been my business partner but also a friend of our\nrespective families. Also, thanks to Oliver Mintzlaff for his stewardship and\nEddie Jordan, my close friend and manager.\"\n\nOracle Red Bull Racing Team Principal and CEO Christian Horner said: \u201cAll of\nour greatest moments from the past 20 years have come with Adrian\u2019s hand on\nthe technical tiller. His vision and brilliance have helped us to 13 titles in\n20 seasons. His exceptional ability to conceptualise beyond F1 and bring wider\ninspiration to bear on the design of grand prix cars, his remarkable talent\nfor embracing change and finding the most rewarding areas of the rules to\nfocus on, and his relentless will to win have helped Red Bull Racing to become\na greater force than I think even the late Dietrich Mateschitz might have\nimagined. More than that, the past 19 years with Adrian have been enormous\nfun. For me, when Adrian joined Red Bull, he was already a superstar designer.\nTwo decades and 13 Championships later he leaves as a true legend. He is also\nmy friend and someone I will be eternally grateful to for everything he\nbrought to our partnership. The legacy he leaves behind will echo through the\nhalls of Milton Keynes and RB17 Track Car will be a fitting testament and\nlegacy to his time with us.\u201d\n\nAdrian\u2019s first true design for the Team, RB3, achieved a podium finish at the\n2007 European Grand Prix. The following year his design achieved the Group\u2019s\nfirst victory with Sebastian Vettel and Toro Rosso at the Italian GP.\nFollowing regulation changes and a unique ability to capitalise on them -\nsomething that has become a hallmark of Adrian\u2019s stellar Red Bull Racing\njourney - his clean sheet RB5 design brought the Team its first win, at the\nChinese Grand Prix in 2009, and five further victories that season.\n\nIn 2010 RB6 carried the Team to its first double title victory, an achievement\nthat was repeated in each of the following three years. The introduction of\nhybrid power to F1 in 2014 led to leaner times and a first step back from sole\nF1 commitment for Adrian to allow creation of the Valkyrie hypercar.\n\nThe arrival of Honda as the Team\u2019s power unit partner in 2019 reignited his\ncompetitive spark. RB16B brought a first Championship in eight years in 2021.\nAn extensive regulation change for the following season resulted in another\nclean sheet design, the RB18, leading to a new era of dominance starting in\n2022 and continuing to this day.\n\n## More like this\n\n2024 Miami Grand Prix\n\n3 \u2013 5 May 2024Miami International Autodrome, United States\n\nF1\n\nThe Last Year In...Miami \ud83c\udf34\n\n10 Photos\n\nF1\n\n2024 AFBE-UK Event\n\n6 Photos\n\nF1\n\n\u00a9 2024 Red Bull Racing Ltd\n\n\u00a9 2024 Red Bull Racing Ltd\n\nThis website uses technically necessary cookies.
