For Aramaic New Testament manuscripts, see List of\nSyriac New Testament manuscripts.\n\nExtract from the Peshitta.\n\nThe Aramaic original New Testament theory is the belief that the Christian New\nTestament was originally written in Aramaic.\n\nThere are several versions of the New Testament in Aramaic languages:\n\n  1. the Vetus Syra (Old Syriac), a translation from Greek into early Classical Syriac, containing most\u2014but not all\u2014of the text of the 4 Gospels, and represented in the Curetonian Gospels and the Sinaitic Palimpsest\n  2. the Christian Palestinian Aramaic Lectionary fragments represented in such manuscripts as Codex Climaci Rescriptus, Codex Sinaiticus Rescriptus, and later lectionary codices (Vatican sir. 19 [A]; St Catherine\u2019s Monastery B, C, D)\n  3. the Classical Syriac Peshitta, a rendering in Aramaic^[citation needed] of the Hebrew (and some Aramaic, e.g. in Daniel and Ezra) Old Testament, plus the New Testament purportedly in its original Aramaic, and still the standard in most Syriac churches\n  4. the Harklean, a strictly literal translation by Thomas of Harqel into Classical Syriac from Greek\n  5. the Assyrian Modern Version, a new translation into Assyrian Neo-Aramaic from the Greek published in 1997 and mainly in use among Protestants\n  6. and a number of other scattered versions in various dialects\n\nThe traditional New Testament of the Peshitta has 22 books, lacking the Second\nEpistle of John, the Third Epistle of John, the Second Epistle of Peter, the\nEpistle of Jude and the Book of Revelation, which are books of the\nAntilegomena. Closure of the Church of the East's New Testament Canon occurred\nbefore the 'Western Five' books could be incorporated. Its Gospels text also\nlacks the verses known as Jesus and the woman taken in adultery (John\n7:53\u20138:11) and Luke 22:17\u201318, but does have the 'long ending of Mark.'^[1]^[2]\n\n## Greek original New Testament hypothesis[edit]\n\nMain article: Language of the New Testament\n\nThe consensus of modern scholars is that the New Testament was written in\nGreek and that an Aramaic source text was used for portions of the New\nTestament, especially the gospels.^[citation needed] They acknowledge that\nmany individual sayings of Jesus as found in the Greek Gospels may be\ntranslations from an Aramaic source referred to as \"Q source\" (from the German\nword Quelle, meaning \"source\"), but hold that the Gospels' text in its current\nform was composed in Greek, and so were the other New Testament writings.\nScholars of all stripes have acknowledged the presence of scattered Aramaic\nexpressions, written phonetically and then translated, in the Greek New\nTestament.^[citation needed]\n\nIn an 1887 book, John Hancock Pettingell says \"The common impression that the\nentire New Testament was first written in Greek, and that all the copies we\nnow have, in whatever tongue, are copies, or translations of the original\nmanuscripts, when seriously examined, is found to have no certain foundation.\nAnd yet this has been taken almost universally for granted. It is probable,\nthat this is true with respect to some, possibly a majority of these books.\nBut it is more than probable, if not certain, that some portions of the New\nTestament, such as the Gospel of Matthew, the Epistles to the Hebrews, and\nothers, which will hereafter be mentioned, were first written in the\nvernacular Syriac of the Jews, and were afterward translated into Greek; and\nthat other portions, perhaps most of the books, were duplicated, at the time\nthey were written, by their authors, or under their direction,\u2014one copy being\nfurnished to those who were familiar with the Greek, and another to those who\nknew only the Syriac.\"^[3]\n\nAn example of how mainstream scholars have dealt with Aramaic influences\nwithin an overall view of the Gospels' original Greek-language development may\nbe found in Martin Hengel's synthesis of studies of the linguistic situation\nin Palestine during the time of Jesus and the Gospels:\n\n> Since non-literary, simple Greek knowledge or competency in multiple\n> languages was relatively widespread in Jewish Palestine including Galilee,\n> and a Greek-speaking community had already developed in Jerusalem shortly\n> after Easter, one can assume that this linguistic transformation [from \"the\n> Aramaic native language of Jesus\" to \"the Greek Gospels\"] began very early.\n> ... [M]issionaries, above all 'Hellenists' driven out of Jerusalem, soon\n> preached their message in the Greek language. We find them in Damascus as\n> early as AD 32 or 33. A certain percentage of Jesus' earliest followers were\n> presumably bilingual and could therefore report, at least in simple Greek,\n> what had been heard and seen. This probably applies to Cephas/Peter, Andrew,\n> Philip or John. Mark, too, who was better educated in Jerusalem than the\n> Galilean fishermen, belonged to this milieu. The great number of\n> phonetically correct Aramaisms and his knowledge of the conditions in Jewish\n> Palestine compel us to assume a Palestinian Jewish-Christian author. Also,\n> the author's Aramaic native language is still discernible in the Marcan\n> style.^[4]\n\n## Aramaic original New Testament hypothesis[edit]\n\nAlthough physical evidence has yet to be found, J.S. Assemane^[5] in his\nBibliotheca stated that a Syriac Gospel dated 78 A.D. was found in\nMesopotamia.^[6]^[7]^[8]\n\nThe hypothesis that the New Testament text that was read by the Apostles would\nhave preserved the life and sayings of Jesus (as he spoke them in Aramaic \u2013\nthe language of Jesus) before it was translated for those not among them who\nspoke Greek is not held by the majority of scholars.^[citation needed]\n\nSyrian churches say that their history includes compilation of their canon\n(which lacked the 'Western Five') extremely early. Comments John Hancock\nPettingell, \"There is no question, but that scattered manuscripts of the\nseveral books of the New Testament, in Greek, were in existence very early,\nfor the Fathers quote from them,\u2014but there is no evidence that any attempt was\nmade to collect them into one code, or canon, till after the Second or Third\nCentury. But it is certain, on the other hand, that the Syrian Churches had\ntheir canon long before this collection was made; tradition says, between the\nyears 55 and 60, and that this was done by the Apostle Jude. This canon is\nknown to have contained all the books now included in our New Testament,\nexcepting the Apocalypse, and the brief Epistles of 2d Peter, 2d and 3d John,\nand Jude. This tradition is strongly corroborated by the fact that these\nclosing portions of our present canon were not then written; and this is a\ngood and sufficient reason why they were not included in the first collection.\nThe abrupt closing of the Book of Acts\u2014for it was evidently written at about\nthat time\u2014that it might be ready for inclusion in this collection, goes to\nconfirm the tradition as to the date of this collection. The Apocalypse and\nthe four short Epistles which were not in readiness to be included at that\nearly date, were afterward received into the Syriac Canon, but not till the\nsixth century.\"^[9]\n\nThe most noteworthy advocate of the \"Peshitta-original\" hypothesis in the West\nwas George Lamsa of the Aramaic Bible Center. A tiny minority of more recent\nscholars are backers of the Peshitta-original theory today, whereas the\noverwhelming majority of scholars consider the Peshitta New Testament to be a\ntranslation from a Greek original. For instance Sebastian Brock wrote:\n\n> The only complete English translation of the Peshitta is by G. Lamsa. This\n> is unfortunately not always very accurate, and his claims that the Peshitta\n> Gospels represent the Aramaic original underlying the Greek Gospels are\n> entirely without foundation; such views, which are not infrequently found in\n> more popular literature, are rejected by all serious scholars.^[10]\n\n(Lamsa and Bauscher did not translate the Old Testament Peshitta's\ndeuterocanonical books, but did translate the remainder of the Peshitta Old\nTestament, plus the New Testament. Gorgias Press has published translations of\nmany Peshitta Old Testament books, and of the entire Peshitta New Testament.)\n\nE. Jan Wilson writes, \"I believe firmly that both Matthew and Luke were\nderived from Aramaic originals.\"^[11]\n\nSome advocates of the \"Peshitta-original\" theory also use the term \"Aramaic\nprimacy\", though this is not used in academic sources. The expression \"Aramaic\nprimacy\" was used by L. I. Levine,^[12] but only as a general expression used\nto denote the primacy of Aramaic over Hebrew and Greek in Jerusalem during the\nSecond Temple period (i.e. roughly 200 BC \u2013 70 AD). The earliest appearance of\nthe phrase in print is in David Bauscher.^[13]\n\nCharles Cutler Torrey, while teaching at Yale, wrote a series of books that\npresented detailed manuscripturial evidence supporting the Aramaic New\nTestament, starting with The Translations Made from the Original Aramaic\nGospels,^[14] and including the widely known Our Translated Gospels.^[15]\n\n## History[edit]\n\nGeorge Lamsa's translation of the Peshitta New Testament from Syriac into\nEnglish brought the claims for primacy of the Aramaic New Testament to the\nWest. However, his translation is poorly regarded by most scholars in the\nfield.^[16]^[17] The Old Syriac Texts, the Sinai palimpsest and the Curetonian\nGospels, have also influenced scholars concerning original Aramaic passages.\nDiatessaronic texts such as the Liege Dutch Harmony, the Pepysian Gospel\nHarmony, Codex Fuldensis, the Persian Harmony, the Arabic Diatessaron, and the\nCommentary on the Diatessaron by Ephrem the Syrian have provided recent\ninsights into Aramaic origins. The Coptic Gospel of Thomas and the various\nversions of the medieval Hebrew Gospel of Matthew also have provided clues to\nAramaic foundations in the New Testament especially the gospels.^[citation\nneeded] Many 19th Century scholars (H. Holtzmann, Wendt, J\u00fclicher, Wernle,\nSoden, Wellhausen, Harnack, B. Weiss, Nicolardot, W. Allen, Montefiore,\nPlummer, and Stanton)^[18]^[failed verification] theorized that portions of\nthe gospels, especially Matthew, were derived from an Aramaic source normally\nreferred to as Q.^[dubious \u2013 discuss]^[citation needed]\n\n### Argument using the Arabic Diatessaron for the old age of the\nPeshitta[edit]\n\nTatian died in A.D. 175. Reasoning and textual evidence suggest that Tatian\nstarted with the 4 Gospels in the Aramaic Peshitta, and interwove Gospel\npassages into one consolidated harmonized narrative to get his Diatesseron, in\nthe process quoting three-fourths of the 4 Gospels. We presently lack Tatian's\nDiatessaron in its original Aramaic, but do have it in translation in Arabic,\na language related to Aramaic. A large number of parallels exist between the\nPeshitta's 4 Gospels and what is in the 'Arabic Diatessaron.' Paul Younan\nsays, \"It makes perfect sense that a harmony of the Gospels would necessarily\nrequire that the distinct 4 Gospels actually existed prior to the harmony.\nThis is common sense. It makes ever more sense that an Aramaic harmony of the\nGospels, which Tatian's Diatesseron was, was woven together from the 4\ndistinct Aramaic Gospels. .... Since the Arabic translation by Ibn al-Tayyib\nis the only one we know for sure was made directly from the Aramaic, and since\nit reads like the Peshitta..., and since we know that a harmony necessitates a\nbase of 4 distinct Gospels from which it must be drawn \u2013 I submit that\nTatian's Aramaic Diatesseron was a harmony of the distinct Gospels in Aramaic\nwe currently find today in the canon of scripture we know as the Peshitta.\nOccam's Razor is a logical principle which states that one should not\nincrease, beyond what is necessary, the number of entities required to explain\nanything. In other words, the simplest explanation is usually the best. The\nsimplest explanation is that Tatian created a harmony of the Peshitta gospels.\nThis harmony existed in Persia until at least the 11th century, when it was\ntranslated into Arabic. ....if we are to believe the textual evidence in the\nArabic translation... the Peshitta Gospels were the base of the Diatesseron\nwhich history attributes to Tatian. And this places the Peshitta Gospels at or\nbefore 175 A.D.\"\n\nThe Arabic Diatessaron has been translated into English, Latin, French, and\nGerman.^[19]\n\n### Argument from geographical details for the old age of the Peshitta[edit]\n\nAdvocates of the Aramaic being written first, and then translated into Greek,\nhave pointed out the geographical details present in the Peshitta, but lacking\nin Greek mss.; those advocates ask what's the best explanation for the\npresence of those geographical details in the Peshitta, but lacking in Greek\nmss.\n\nJohann David Michaelis states:^[20]\n\n> In the Cur\u00e6, in Act. Apost. \u00a7 vi. p. 73, 74. I have taken notice of certain\n> traces in the Syriac version, which lead to the supposition of its having\n> been made by a native Jew. To the reasons alleged in that treatise, which I\n> submit to the determination of my readers, I will add, that the Syriac\n> translator appears to have been so well acquainted with Palestine, that he\n> must at least have visited that country, for he has frequently restored\n> geographical names in the Greek Testament to their true Oriental\n> orthography. Capernaum is written in the Syriac Testament ... , that is, the\n> village of Nahum; Bethania, is written ... ; Bethphage is written ... ,\n> which perfectly corresponds to its situation, for ... , in Arabic, signifies\n> 'a valley between two opposite mountains,' an etymology which alone removes\n> a contradiction which was supposed to exist between the New Testament and\n> the Talmud ; and Bethesda, John v. 2. is written ... , which is probably\n> conformable to the derivation, whether we translate it 'place of favour,' or\n> 'place of the conflux of waters.' The Syriac version therefore is the\n> surest, and indeed the only guide, in discovering the etymology of\n> geographical names, for the Arabic versions are too modern, and in other\n> translations it was impossible to preserve the orthography of the East.\n\nWilliam Norton states:^[2]\n\n> \u2014 In the names of places, the Peshito shows the same independence of the\n> Greek. ....in Acts xxi. 7, the Gk. has, Ptolemais; the Syriac has, Acu.\n>\n> Mr. Jer. Jones, in his work on the Canon, 1798, contends that the use of the\n> name Acu, for Ptolemais, is a decisive proof that the Peshito must have been\n> made not far in time from A.D. 70, when Jerusalem was destroyed. (vol. i. p.\n> 103.) He says that the most ancient name of this place among the Israelites\n> was Aco, or Acco, Judges i. 31; that this name was afterwards changed to\n> Ptolemais; that some say it had its new name from Ptolemy Philadelphus,\n> about 250 B.C. He says it is certain that the old name Aco, was antiquated\n> and out of use in the time of the Romans, and that the use of the old name\n> Acu, in the Peshito, can be accounted for in no other way, but by supposing\n> that the persons for whom the version was made were more acquainted with it,\n> than with the new name Ptolemais; that upon any other supposition it would\n> have been absurd for him to have used Acu. He says, that until the\n> destruction of Jerusalem, one may suppose that the Jews may have retained\n> the old name Aco still, out of fondness for its antiquity; but, he says,\n>\n> \"how they, or any other part of Syria, could, after the Roman conquest, call\n> it by a name different from the Romans, seems to me impossible to conceive.\n> . . To suppose, therefore, that this translation, in which we meet with this\n> old name, instead of the new one, was made at any great distance of time\n> after the destruction of Jerusalem, is to suppose the translator to have\n> substituted an antiquated name known to but few, for a name well known to\n> all\" (pp. 104, 105.)\n>\n> Mr. Jones says that a similar proof that the Peshito cannot have been made\n> much after A.D. 70, is found in the fact that the Peshito often calls the\n> Gentiles, as the Jews were accustomed to do, profane persons, where the\n> Greek calls them the nations, that is, the Gentiles. The Peshito calls them\n> profane, in Matt. vi. 7; x. 5; xviii. 17; Mark vii. 26; John vii. 35; Acts\n> xviii. 4, 17; 1 Cor. v. 1; x. 20, 27; xii. 2; 1 Pet. iv. 3. The expression\n> is used, therefore, throughout the Peshito. Mr. Jones says, that it shows\n> that the writer was a Jew, for no other person would have called all the\n> world profane; and that after the destruction of the temple, all Hebrew\n> Christians must have seen that other nations were not to be reckoned unclean\n> and profane in the Jewish sense, and that therefore this version must have\n> been made either before, or soon after, A.D. 70. (On Canon, Vol. i., pp.\n> 106\u2013110.)\n\n### Argument from bad Greek grammar in Revelation to it not being originally\nGreek[edit]\n\nTorrey opines that Revelation was originally in Aramaic, and points to\ngrammatical monstrosities as evidence that it was not originally written in\nGreek:\n\n> For the Apocalyptist the language of the New Dispensation of the Christian\n> Church was Aramaic only. It is most significant that the numerous hymns and\n> doxologies sung or recited by the saints and angels in heaven, in chapter\n> after chapter of the book, are composed in Aramaic (wherever it is possible\n> to decide), not in Hebrew; though the writer could have used either\n> language. ....\n>\n> There is excellent reason, however, for one conclusion he [R.H. Charles]\n> reaches\u2014expressed in similar words by many before him\u2014namely, that \"the\n> linguistic character of the Apocalypse is absolutely unique.\" The\n> grammatical monstrosities of the book, in their number and variety and\n> especially in their startling character, stand alone in the history of\n> literature. It is only in the Greek that they are apparent, for it is the\n> form, not the sense, that is affected. A few of the more striking solecisms\n> are exhibited here in English translation, so that any reader may see their\n> nature.\n>\n> 1:4. \u201cGrace to you, and peace, from he who is and who was and who is to\n> come\u201d (all nom. case). 1:15. \u201cHis legs were like burnished brass (neut.\n> gend., dative case) as in a furnace purified (fem. gend., sing. no., gen.\n> case)\u201d 11:3. \u201cMy witnesses (nom.) shall prophesy for many days clothed\n> (accus.) in sackcloth.\u201d 14:14. \u201cI saw on the cloud one seated like unto a\n> son-of-man (accus.), having (nom.) upon his head a golden crown.\u201d 14:19. \u201cHe\n> harvested the vintage of the earth, and cast it into the winepress (fem.),\n> the great [winepress] (masc.) of the wrath of God.\u201d 17:4. \u201cA golden cup\n> filled with abominations (gen.) and with unclean things (accus.).\u201d 19:20.\n> \u201cThe lake of blazing fire (\u201cfire,\u201d neut.; \u201cblazing,\u201d fem.). 20:2. \u201cAnd he\n> seized the dragon (accus.), the old serpent (nom.), who is the Devil and\n> Satan and bound him.\u201d 21:9. \u201cSeven angels, holding the seven bowls (accus.)\n> filled (gen.) with the seven last plagues.\u201d 22:5. \u201cThey have no need of\n> lamplight (gen.) nor of sunlight (accus.).\u201d\n>\n> This apparent linguistic anarchy has no explanation on the Greek side. It is\n> hardly surprising that to some readers it should have seemed open defiance\n> of grammar, to others a symptom of mental aberration. Nevertheless there is\n> method to it all. The more grotesque these barbarisms, the more certain it\n> is that they are not due to lack of acquaintance with Greek.^[21]\n\n### Historical criticism[edit]\n\nAn argument that at least one of the Greek books of the New Testament have\nbeen translated out of the Aramaic comes from a textual analysis of those\nattributed to the Apostle John. Their variation in writing style is so\nconsiderable, that it would preclude them having been written in Greek by the\nsame author. St Dionysius of Alexandria lent support to this argument, when\npointing out how John's style of writing differs so markedly between his\nGospel and Revelation. He concluded that the sophisticated writer of the\nformer could not have written the clumsy Greek of the latter. Thus, the only\nway for John to have been the author of Revelation is for it to have been\npenned by a translator. However, Dionysius himself left open the possibility\nthat it was written in Greek \"by a holy and inspired writer\" other than\nJohn.^[22]\n\nSome have argued that the Aramaic gospels are older than the Greek gospels,\nand that the Aramaic NT wasn't derived from the Greek NT. William Norton\ncommented in 1889:^[23]\n\n> \"Faust Nairon, a Maronite, is often referred to by J. S. Asseman as a writer\n> of eminence. He was one of the two editors of the edition of the Peshito\n> Syriac Version, printed by the side of an Arabic Version of the N. T., in\n> 1703, by command of the Roman Congregation De propaganda fide, for the use\n> of the Maronites. He also wrote the preface. In this he said, (p. 2.) 'The\n> Syriac text excels in antiquity all other texts. By it very many places\n> which in these are obscure, may be made plain.' He proceeds to endeavour to\n> prove that the Syriac text is more ancient than the Greek text of the\n> Gospels. He mentions the common opinion that the Syriac Gospels were\n> translated from the Greek, and says that there are better reasons for\n> concluding that the Greek Gospels were translated from the Syriac. [....] F.\n> Nairon says in proof that THE PESHITO, AS A WHOLE, IS NOT A MERE TRANSLATION\n> OF THE GREEK COPIES, that the number of books in it is different from that\n> of the Greek text, which has 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, Jude, and Revelation.\n> That the order of books is also different from their order in most Greek\n> copies; for James, 1 Peter, and 1 John, follow the Acts; and that the Greek\n> text has passages which the Peshito has not.\"\n\nNorton later adds (on p. xlvii):\n\n> Persons familiar with the Peshito admit the truth of Faust Nairon's remark,\n> that the Peshito does really sometimes \"make clear, things difficult or\n> doubtful in the Greek.\" (Introduction, p. 9.)\n>\n> Bishop Walton quotes with approval the remark of De Dieu, that \"the true\n> meaning of phrases which often occur in the N. T., can scarcely be sought\n> from any other source than the Syriac.\" (Polyg. Prol. xiii. 19.)\n>\n> J. D. Michaelis says, \"the Syriac Version leads us sometimes to just and\n> beautiful explanations, where other help is insufficient.\" (Marsh's\n> Michaelis, vol. ii. p. 44.)'\n\nNorton mentions (on lix\u2013lx) additional scholars who had high regard for the\nAramaic, and gives a fuller exposition of Michaelis:\n\n> Jacob Martini was Professor of Theology in the University of Wittenberg, and\n> wrote a preface to the N. T. Peshito-Syriac, in which he said, \"It is a\n> version, but of all, it is the first and most ancient. . . It is a version,\n> but made either by one of the Evangelists, or at least, of those who . . .\n> had the Apostles themselves present, whom they could consult and hear,\n> respecting many of the more obscure places. To this only, therefore, when\n> some obscurity or difficulty occurs in Greek copies, can we safely go. This\n> only, when doubt arises respecting the meaning or translation of any\n> passage, can be consulted with safety and freedom from error. By this only,\n> the Greek Text is truly illustrated, and rightly understood.\" (See Gutbier's\n> Preface to his Syriac N. T., 1663, p. 26.) J. D. Michaelis, in his\n> Introduction to the N. T., 1787, chap, vii., sec. 4., says, \"The Syriac\n> Testament has been my constant study.\" In sec. 8., he says, \"The Peshito is\n> the very best translation of the Greek Testament that I have ever read. Of\n> all the Syriac authors with which I am acquainted, not excepting Ephraem and\n> Bar Hebraeus, its language is the most elegant and pure. . . . It has no\n> marks of the stiffness of a translation, but is written with the ease and\n> fluency of an original.\" \"What is not to be regarded as a blemish, it\n> differs frequently from the modern modes of explanation; but I know of no\n> version that is so free from error, and none that I consult with so much\n> confidence in cases of difficulty and doubt. I have never met with a single\n> instance where the Greek is so interpreted, as to betray a weakness and\n> ignorance in the translator; and though in many other translations the\n> original is rendered in so extraordinary a manner as almost to excite a\n> smile, the Syriac version must be ever read with profound veneration.\" \"The\n> affinity of the Syriac to the dialect of Palestine is so great, as to\n> justify, in some respects, the assertion that the Syriac translator has\n> recorded the actions and speeches of Christ in the very language in which he\n> spoke.\" \"The Syriac New Testament is written in the same language [as that\n> of Christ], but in a different dialect, ... in the purest Mesopotamian.\"....\n> Professor Wichelhaus, 1850, dwells much on the worth of the Peshito. He\n> calls it, \"The most ancient witness, a version most accurate, untouched and\n> untarnished, ever transcribed and preserved by the Syrians with the greatest\n> care.\" (p. 236.) He did not see why, with some few exceptions, it should not\n> be \"most like to the autographs of the Apostles.\" (p. 264.)\n\n### Mistranslations[edit]\n\nWriting in 1936, Charles Cutler Torrey explains that the mistranslation at Jn\n14:2 arose from an erroneous vocalization.^[24]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * List of English Bible translations#Modern Aramaic to English translations\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ The text of the New Testament: an introduction to the critical ...

He says it is certain that the old name Aco, was antiquated and out of use in the time of the Romans, and that the use of the old name Acu, in the Peshito, can be accounted for in no other way, but by supposing that the persons for whom the version was made were more acquainted with it, than with the new name Ptolemais; that upon any other supposition it would have been absurd for him to have used Acu. He says, that until the destruction of Jerusalem, one may suppose that the Jews may have retained the old name Aco still, out of fondness for its antiquity; but, he says, \"how they, or any other part of Syria, could, after the Roman conquest, call it by a name different from the Romans, seems to me impossible to conceive. . . To suppose, therefore, that this translation, in which we meet with this old name, instead of the new one, was made at any great distance of time after the destruction of Jerusalem, is to suppose the translator to have substituted an antiquated name known to but few, for a name well known to all\" (pp. 104, 105.) Mr. Jones says that a similar proof that the Peshito cannot have been made much after A.D. 70, is found in the fact that the Peshito often calls the Gentiles, as the Jews were accustomed to do, profane persons, where the Greek calls them the nations, that is, the Gentiles. The Peshito calls them profane, in Matt. vi. 7; x. 5; xviii.17; Mark vii. 26; John vii. 35; Acts xviii.4, 17; 1 Cor. v. 1; x. 20, 27; xii. 2; 1 Pet. iv.3. The expression is used, therefore, throughout the Peshito. Mr. Jones says, that it shows that the writer was a Jew, for no other person would have called all the world profane; and that after the destruction of the temple, all Hebrew Christians must have seen that other nations were not to be reckoned unclean and profane in the Jewish sense, and that therefore this version must have been made either before, or soon after, A.D. 70.\" (On Canon, Vol. i., pp. 106\u2013110.)\n  3. ^ Pettingell, John Hancock (1887). \"The Gospel of Life in the Syriac New Testament\".
