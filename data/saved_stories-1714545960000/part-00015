Most people use SQLite without any kind of\nlicense or support.\n\nFree support for SQLite is available on the public SQLite Forum. The forum is\nmonitored by a large community of experts, including the core SQLite\ndevelopment team, who are able to resolve just about any problems with SQLite\nthat you are likely to have.\n\nIf you do not want to discuss your issues on a public and open forum, an\nAnnual Maintenance Subscription or \"AMS\" might serve your needs better. An AMS\nentitles you to private email support directly from the developers of SQLite.\nThe level of support with an AMS is similar to the support one gets from the\npublic forum except that an AMS includes a unilateral promise of non-\ndisclosure, so with an AMS you can discuss your issues with the SQLite\ndevelopers in private, without the whole world watching. An AMS costs $1500\nper year.\n\nUsers with more advanced support needs can opt for a Technical Support\nAgreement. Technical support agreements are customized to the needs of each\nindividual client, but generally include direct telephone support and priority\nhandling of issues and bugs. Guaranteed response time is available as an\noption. The cost of technical support varies but is generally in the range of\n$8000 to $35000 per year.\n\nIf SQLite is \"mission critical\" to your company, then you may want to become\nan SQLite Consortium Member. The SQLite Consortium is a collaboration of\ncompanies who sponsor ongoing development of SQLite in exchange for\nenterprise-level technical support, on-site visits from the SQLite developers,\nunlimited access to all licensed products, and strong guarantees that SQLite\nwill remain in the public domain, free and independent, and will not come\nunder the control of a competitor.\n\n## Software Licenses\n\nThe SQLite source code is in the public domain, and is free for use by anyone\nand for any purpose. No license is required. However, some users desire a\nlicense so that they can have warranty of title, or just because their company\nlawyers say they need one. A perpetual license and warranty of title for the\ncore SQLite source code is available for this purpose.\n\nThe SQLite Encryption Extension (SEE), the ZIPVFS Extension, and the\nCompressed and Encrypted ReadOnly Database (CEROD) extension are enhanced\nversions of SQLite that handle encrypted and/or compressed databases. SEE can\nread and write encrypted databases. SEE encrypts all database content,\nincluding metadata, so that the database file appears as white noise. ZIPVFS\ncompresses the database on-the-fly using application-supplied compression and\ndecompression functions. CEROD reads a compressed database that is also\noptionally encrypted. All of SEE, ZIPVFS, and CEROD are supplied in source\ncode form only; the licensee is responsible for compiling the products for\ntheir chosen platform. It is not difficult to compile any of these extension.\nAll products come in the form of an {amalgamated source file} named\n\"sqlite3.c\". So compiling SEE, ZIPVFS, or CEROD into an application is simply\na matter of substituting the SEE-, ZIPVFS-, or CEROD-enabled sqlite3.c source\nfile in place of the public-domain sqlite3.c source file and recompiling.\nLicenses for SEE, ZIPVFS, and CEROD are perpetual. All three extension can\nread and write ordinary, uncompressed and unencrypted database files.\n\n## Testing Services\n\nThe Test Harness #3 (TH3) is a suite of test cases for SQLite that provide\n100% branch test coverage (and 100% modified condition/decision coverage) for\nthe core SQLite in an as-deployed configuration using only published and\ndocumented interfaces. TH3 is designed for use with embedded devices, and is\ncompatible with DO-178B. Every release of the public-domain SQLite is tested\nusing TH3, and so all users benefit from the TH3 tests. But the TH3 tests are\nnot themselves public. Hardware or system manufactures who want to have TH3\ntest run on their systems can negotiate a service agreement to have the SQLite\nDevelopers run those tests.\n\n## About The SQLite Team\n\nPaid support options and products are provided by Hipp, Wyrick & Company,\nInc., (Hwaci), a Georgia corporation with headquarters in Charlotte, North\nCarolina and has been in business since 1992. Hwaci has an international team\nof employees and associates representing the best available talent. We are a\n100% engineering company. There is no sales staff. Our goal is to provide\noutstanding service and honest advice without spin or sales-talk.\n\nHwaci is a small company but it is also closely held and debt-free and has low\nfixed costs, which means that it is largely immune to buy-outs, take-overs,\nand market down-turns. Hwaci intends to continue operating in its current\nform, and at roughly its current size until at least the year 2050. We expect\nto be here when you need us, even if that need is many years in the future.\n\nThis page last modified on 2023-10-10 17:29:48 UTC\n\n", "frontpage": false}
