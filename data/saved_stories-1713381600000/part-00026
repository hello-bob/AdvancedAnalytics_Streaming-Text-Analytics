Why is it so popular? Why do we find it so\nuseful?\n\nThe truth is, I find most self-help advice to be obvious. Rarely do I read a\nself-help book or post and find it revolutionary. I think this about my self-\nhelp posts too.\n\nWhile writing, I often wonder if anyone will find my advice useful. I imagine\nmyself as a reader thinking \u201cDuh, obviously I shouldn\u2019t overwork myself or\nwatch too much TV\u201d.\n\nBut the true power of self-help is learning new tactics to achieve these\nobvious goals in life. Gamification, mindset shifts, and experimentation are\nall the real fruits of self-help. And it\u2019s awesome if you\u2019re like me and love\ntrying new self-help tactics because of all the content out there.\n\nBut there\u2019s also a dangerous side to the abundance.\n\n## Self-Help Addiction\n\nCaleb Schoep has a piece called \u201cProductivity Porn\u201d. I recommend reading it,\nbut the TLDR is this: Consuming content about productive people or how to be\nproductive can replace the need to actually be productive. The same applies to\nself-help.\n\nI\u2019ve seen myself fall into a trap that goes something like this:\n\n  1. Finish reading a self-help book that has tons of great advice.\n  2. Feel that my life has already improved because it was so insightful.\n  3. Get the urge to experiment and implement the newly gained knowledge, but that requires work, so I\u2019ll watch a YouTube video about someone doing it instead.\n  4. YouTuber validates how great everything is now, and I get so excited that I made the right choice to have read the book.\n  5. I wonder what other wonderful self-help advice there is, so I find recommendations and buy another book off Amazon to start the cycle over again.\n\nThe problem is that life hasn\u2019t changed since reading the book. I only\ntemporarily feel better because of the exciting new knowledge, but after the\nhigh is gone, I still have the same life problems.\n\nThere\u2019s some clear personal responsibility failure here, but I know I\u2019m not\nthe only one who does this, and there\u2019s a reason for it.\n\n## It\u2019s a Business\n\nA big problem with self-help content is how they describe themselves and how\nmuch it hypes the reader. Look at the cover or back of any self-help book.\nYou\u2019ll quickly see exaggerated promises and highlighted reviews about how\nlife-changing the content is.\n\nFor example, \u201cThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck\u201d\u2019s website has some great\nsnippets like the following: Note: I chose this book because it was my, and\nmany others, first book in the self-help genre.\n\n\u201cThis breakout, mega bestseller is the self-help book for people who hate\nself-help. It\u2019s as much a pat on the back as a slap in the face. It\u2019s the\nfirst truly no BS guide to flourishing in a crazy, crazy world\u2014a truly\ncounterintuitive approach to living a good life.\u201d\n\nWow. This sounds awesome! It\u2019s not like the other self-help books. This is\nreal and the others are just full of BS! (I\u2019m not trying to be sarcastic, this\nis legitimately what I thought many years ago when I picked up the book).\n\nScroll down a bit, and you\u2019ll find amazing reviews from notable people (funny\nenough most from other self-help authors).\n\nAnd the truth is, none of this is evil. The book is good - I\u2019ve learned things\nfrom it. But as readers, we need to give ourselves a reality check.\n\nReading this book at best improved my life by 1-2%, which is great, but I\nwouldn\u2019t say it matches the hype I got when I read about it. This letdown\nbecomes really apparent after reading the 10th self-help book in a row\ndescribed as life-changing. How can all these books promise life-changing\nresults, but after reading them all I\u2019m not a levitating life guru creating\nNirvana on earth?\n\nThe reality is that the self-help industry is not a charity. Lots of people\nmake lots of money off of this stuff, and that\u2019s not a terrible thing (I\nwouldn\u2019t mind making money off of my writing one day). But there is a bit of a\nconflict of interest.\n\nIf everyone wants you to buy their life-changing book or watch their eye-\nopening YouTube video, they need to make it as enticing as possible. The\nresult is, as consumers, we don\u2019t take the time to fully absorb what we\nlearned since it\u2019s so easy to get distracted by what\u2019s next.\n\n## A Confession\n\nTo be honest, I feel slightly weird when I write self-help blog posts. Who am\nI to give advice? I\u2019m just someone trying to live a fulfilling life, exactly\nlike everyone else. And a lot of the \u201cadvice\u201d I write about is myself\nexploring and sharing what is working at the time. Because of this, it isn\u2019t\nunusual for me to look back on posts and think, \u201cOh right, I used to do/think\nthat.\u201d\n\nBut writing and sharing this stuff has been critical in improving my life. So\nin a sense, my \u201ccosplaying\u201d as a source of self-help for other people is\nreally just myself practicing self-help. And if people get inspired to try\nsomething out by it, that makes it worth continuing despite my criticisms\nabout self-help. In the end, there is value that can be had from consuming and\nproducing self-help content, but we all need to be mindful of the realities of\nwhat it can and can\u2019t do for us.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
