restructuring its finance organization, a move that will include\nlayoffs and relocations, as the company pushes resources to favor investments\nin artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cThe tech sector is in the midst of a tremendous platform shift with Al,\u201d\nPorat wrote in the memo, obtained by CNBC, that was sent to employees in\nfinance. \u201cAs a company, this means we have the opportunity to make more\nhelpful products for billions of users and provide faster solutions to our\ncustomers, but it also means we collectively have to make tough decisions,\nincluding how and where we work to align with our highest priority areas.\u201d\n\nThe latest cuts follow a broader effort by Google to rearrange its workforce\nand resources to accommodate further investment in new technologies such as AI\nas advertising growth slows. CEO Sundar Pichai told employees in January that\nmore job cuts were likely coming in 2024, though he did not specify which\nteams would be affected.\n\nThe restructuring will affect finance teams domestically and abroad, including\nin the Asia-Pacific region and Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Porat\nnoted.\n\nPorat also wrote that the company would create \u201chubs\u201d for more centralized\noperations including in Bangalore, Mexico City, Dublin, Chicago and Atlanta.\nThe company plans to maintain a significant presence in the San Francisco Bay\nArea, she noted.\n\n\u201cOver the past year, we have talked about creating hubs of Fin\u2019ooglers around\nthe world that are vibrant and have a strong culture,\u201d Porat wrote. \u201cThis\nstrategy will help us be a more efficient organization and enables us to run\n24 hours a day while respecting Fin\u2019ooglers worktimes.\u201d\n\nFin\u2019oogler is the company\u2019s term for a Google employee in finance.\n\nPorat ended her note saying, \u201cWe are sad to say goodbye to some talented\nteammates and friends we care about, and we know this change is difficult.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve said, we\u2019re responsibly investing in our company\u2019s biggest\npriorities and the significant opportunities ahead,\u201d a Google spokesperson\ntold CNBC in an email. \u201cTo best position us for these opportunities,\nthroughout the second half of 2023 and into 2024, a number of our teams made\nchanges to become more efficient and work better, remove layers and align\ntheir resources to their biggest product priorities.\u201d\n\n## Don\u2019t miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO\n\n  * Wednesday\u2019s analyst calls: Tesla price target cuts, GE spinoff to pop more than 20%\n  * If you\u2019re worried about a correction and over-invested in Nvidia, replace it with these steady growth stocks instead\n  * It may be time for investors to sell Nvidia on the next bounce, according to the charts\n  * Wall Street is bullish on copper, thanks to AI.
