A report by a panel of experts\nreleased days after that hearing also underscored the need for the FAA to\naddress the shortage of air traffic controllers and invest in new technology\nthat could prevent such problems. Earlier this month, the FAA announced that\nit would install runway safety technology at several airports, including\nAustin-Bergstrom International and Indianapolis International, as part of its\neffort to eliminate close calls.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThursday\u2019s incident also is adding fuel to the debate in Congress over whether\nmore flights should be added at National Airport.\n\nVirginia Sens. Mark Warner (D) and Tim Kaine (D) took to the Senate floor to\nexpress their concern about the incident, saying the \u201cnear catastrophe\u201d\nillustrates the risk passengers could face if more flights are added at\nNational.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe incident yesterday was a big warning light flashing red, telling Congress\nnot to take steps to weaken the safety of this airport,\u201d said Kaine.\n\nAdded Warner: \u201cWhy would we sacrifice safety \u2014 or that matter just the ability\nto get in and out of that airport, any more? The safety of the flying public\nmust be our focus.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nKaine and Warner are among D.C.-area lawmakers pushing back against a plan to\nadd flights at National, which is included in the Senate version of the\nmeasure to fund the FAA.\n\nTheir remarks drew strong pushback from Capital Access Alliance, which wants\nto add more flights at National.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ironic that the same members of Congress who are seeking to exploit\n[Thursday\u2019s] incident at DCA have stayed silent when numerous similar\nincidents have taken place around the country, including at Dulles in 2018 and\nat many other airports,\u201d said Brian Walsh, a CAA spokesman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCAA, whose members include Delta Air Lines and business groups around the\ncountry, argue that adding air service at National would lower ticket prices\nand make it easier for travelers from across the country to visit the nation\u2019s\ncapital. But members of the D.C.-area delegation say the airport is already at\ncapacity and adding more flights would pose safety risks.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe Senate version of the FAA funding bill includes a provision that would add\nfive flights at National. However, the House version of the funding bill did\nnot include additional flights. Lawmakers are currently negotiating what\nprovisions will be included in the final version of the measure.\n\nNational\u2019s unique status as one of two airports owned by the federal\ngovernment \u2014 alongside Dulles International Airport \u2014 means Congress has the\npower to make changes to how it operates. Current rules limit the number of\nflights and the distance they travel. But Congress has made changes over the\nyears.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, which manages National and\nDulles, has long argued that adding long-distance flights at National harms\nDulles because the international airport is less convenient for some travelers\nin the District and close-in suburbs. It also contends that National\u2019s small\nfootprint \u2014 it was built to handle 15 million annual passengers, but now\nhandles 24 million \u2014 would make it difficult to accommodate additional\nflights.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nA 2021 report by the Government Accountability Office examined the effect of\nthe perimeter rule, a guideline limiting flights, at National and cited a mix\nof results. It noted that allowing more long-distance flights resulted in\nlarger aircraft operating at National, fueling passenger growth but also\nraising concerns about traffic and whether the airport had enough space to\naccommodate additional travelers.\n\nThe GAO did not take a position on whether additional long-distance flights\nshould be permitted or whether the perimeter rule should be abolished.\nHowever, it did say that doing away with the rule \u201cwould likely be a detriment\nto passengers in certain communities\u201d because airlines might reduce service to\nsmaller markets in favor of larger, more lucrative routes.\n\nIt also noted that lifting the rule could foster more competition, potentially\nlowering airfares on some long-distance routes. Still, it cautioned that it\nwould be \u201cchallenging to predict or quantify such effects.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nTravel\n\nLocal guides, travel tips and the latest industry news\n\nYou can still find affordable flights to Europe this summer\n\nAdvice|You asked: Is it rude to deplane before the row ahead of me?\n\nAmerica\u2019s most loathed airport is cool now\n\nback\n\nTry a different topic\n\nSign in or create a free account to save your preferences\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nwashingtonpost.com \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n  * washingtonpost.com\n  * \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n", "frontpage": false}
