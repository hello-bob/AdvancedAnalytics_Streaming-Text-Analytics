It is a bad\nidea.\n\nVinay Prasad\n\nApr 21, 2024\n\n302\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Why you should NOT get a whole body MRI\n\nwww.drvinayprasad.com\n\n98\n\nShare\n\nThere is a debate online about whether or not it is paternalistic for doctors\nto counsel patients against getting a whole body MRI from services like\nPrenuvo. The arguments drift towards cost and who should pay for further\nworkup, but what if the test and all downstream procedures were free? What if\nwe focused just on the health impact? Should you get a whole body MRI? Would\nI? Why not?\n\nHow you feel about the question depends heavily on your model of cancer. Most\npeople think that cancer starts in a target organ (the breast or lung), grows\nfor a while, and then sheds it cells into the blood (or lymphatics) and\nspreads. Most people think that we can cure cancer when it it is localized,\nbut can\u2019t when it spreads. They think our treatments for cancer that has\nspread are toxic and barbaric and anything you can do to avoid that is\nbeneficial.\n\nBased on this worldview, any tumor you find that hasn\u2019t spread is a life\nsaved. Millions have had tumors found by mammograms or PSA screening, and feel\nlike they were saved. As such, screening is good. What\u2019s the worst that could\nhappen, you get a false scare, but are reassured later? That\u2019s preferable to\nthe alternative or missing a tumor and dying as a result.\n\nThe problem is that this model of cancer is naive and incorrect. I am going to\noffer a richer model, but I am also going to simplify so it is understandable.\nImagine there are 3 types of tumors. They all look like the same cancer under\nthe microscope.\n\nAll tumors start in a target organ (breast, lung or colon). The first grow\nslowly and are unlikely to shed cells elsewhere. These are not going to kill\nyou in your natural life. You might feel them with your hand someday and cut\nthem out, but even if you didn\u2019t, you have nothing to worry about.\n\nThe second are those that spread microscopic cells very early on. Even if you\nfind them when small, they have seeded other organs. There is almost nothing\nyou can do to avoid dying by this cancer short of removing all your organs\nprophylactically\u2014 but then you have other issues. If you find this tumor and\ncut it out and take chemo\u2014 you still die of that cancer\u2014 but with a few more\nsurgeries and more time on chemo than had you found it later.\n\nThe third type of tumor is the tumor that starts in the target organ, and was\ngoing to spread, and going to kill you, but because you find it and cut it\nout, you live much longer than you otherwise would. This is what we want to\nfind!\n\nNow consider that all three are indistinguishable under the microscope. All\nget the same treatment\u2014 surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.\n\nThe problem is that finding tumors #1 and #2 is not good for you. You are\nsubject to surgery, radiation and chemotherapy that you don\u2019t need. These\ninterventions can improve survival when done appropriately, but when done on\npeople who don\u2019t need them, result in a net loss of survival. Your life is\nshorter and worse off if you got these treatments when you can\u2019t benefit.\n\nFinding #3 is great, and I wish we could find selectively.\n\nWhat does whole body MRI find?\n\nThe answer is we have no fucking clue what tumors will be found by whole body\nMRI. Are we more likely to find #3s or are we finding mostly #1s and #2? IF\nyou find too many of the first two, you might actually shorten survival.\n\nWe are probably not finding #3s\n\nThe thing experts in cancer screening know is that finding #3s is challenging,\nand our efforts to screen for cancer are a total failure. No cancer screening\ntest has ever shown overall survival or even all cancer death benefits in a\nrandomized trial. CT screening for lung CA briefly did in NSLT, but that was\nnoise and lost when Pinsky re-examined it.\n\nAll proven cancer screening tests have limited impact on cause specific\nmortality. Meaning that we mostly don\u2019t find #3s. This is from my paper.\nDeaths NOT SAVED is the dominant category.\n\nFinally, all screening tests have a high rate of number needed to diagnose\u2014\nnumber of people who undergo treatment to avert one death. Even in the\npositive PSA trials, this number is in the high 20s. Thats a lot of over-\ntreatment.\n\nFinally, MRI looks at tissues known for indolent biology (e.g the thyroid, the\nadrenals, the kidneys), if anything it might perform worse than mammography.\nFor these reasons, I worry that MRI screening is much more likely to find #1s\nthan #3s, and I would need data to convince me otherwise.\n\nThe toxicity from treating people who don\u2019t benefit adds up\n\nChemotherapy that you don\u2019t need isn\u2019t a good thing. The only thing worse is\nliving in a delusion where you thought you needed it. Chemo increases the risk\nof secondary cancers. Getting radiation and surgery that you don\u2019t need is\nalso harmful. These things will increase death rates. It doesn\u2019t take much of\nan increase in these off target deaths to negate any benefit from screening.\n\nWhy it is more complicated than this?\n\nThe truth is more complicated because some tumors don\u2019t cause harm even if\nthey spread, and that the counterfactual where you don\u2019t find it on scan x is\nnot always not finding it, but finding it as you might otherwise (with your\nfinger or a some symptom). Screening is always against the backdrop of life in\nAmerica, and must show benefits above and beyond normal life. But even with a\nmore complex model\u2014 which is how I think about cancer\u2014 screening falls short\nwithout hard data.\n\nWhy I won\u2019t do it?\n\nArrogant people have tried doing things to healthy people to make them better\noff for thousands of years. Nearly none of these people did any good, and the\nmajority did more harm than good. Modern AI and tech researchers are not much\nsmarter than our ancestors. They are just as arrogant (perhaps more so), and\nprobably getting this wrong.\n\nHow to validate Prenuvo\n\nThe only difference is now we know the definitive experiment to see who is\nright. A randomized trial powered for all cause mortality. Take 250,000 people\nand put half in the whole body MRI and let the others live normally, and see\nif they live longer. If you think this takes too long, crank up the sample\nsize to 10 million. (PS the median need not be reached for OS to be shown),\nand it will result sooner.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t the FDA demand proper data from GRAIL and prenuvo?\n\nExpecting the FDA to do the right thing is even more foolish than thinking\nPrenuvo helps. The FDA approved covid 19 shots and boosters for babies based\non no credible data; They are approving Alzheimers drugs that don\u2019t work.\nPostpartum depression drugs that are dangerous, and cancer drugs that don\u2019t\nwork. The agency is run by people who are not good at evidence based medicine\n(Peter Marks, Rick Pazdur, Bob Califf), and under tremendous political\npressure to approve products so that politicians get more donations. Most FDA\nemployees work for the industry when they leave. I don\u2019t expect much from\nthem.\n\nClosing thoughts\n\nI want to address this final comment.\n\nMost people in healthcare and technology don\u2019t understand screening. They\nhaven\u2019t studied it, and have a poor understanding of cancer.\n\nIf you want to learn more about cancer screening; here are the 17 articles I\nhave written on the topic over the last decade.

Complications\nfrom the surgery to remove it were life-threatening. Only afterward did I read\nDr. H. Gilbert Welch's \"Overdiagnosed\" which makes the same points you are.\nBetween 1975 and 2005 yearly kidney cancer diagnoses went from 7000 to 13,000\nper 100k. Presumably all those diagnoses led to an intervention. Deaths went\nfrom roughly 4000 to....4000. So we can conclude NONE of those interventions,\non average, led to saving any lives.Expand full commentLike (19)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n2 replies\n\nLJR19 hrs agoThe older I get (early 70s) the more wary I am of all these tests\n--especially mammo-- for exactly this reason. Yet one is led to believe that\navoiding them is un-American, incredibly risky, and will piss your doctors off\nsuch that the doctor-patient relationship is seriously undermined. I'm always\nlooking for doctors that do not \"go by the book\" as one once told me. Who are\nopen to being flexible about association-mandated testing and pharmaceutical\ntherapies. But I understand that doctors are evaluated on how many of their\npatients conform to these norms, they are overwhelmed and worried about being\nsued for missing something, and just want to get through the day without\nhaving to have a big discussion about the DEXA or the mammo. It's really hard\nto decide what to do--or not do. I've been putting off the mammo and screening\npelvic ultrasound for the last year or so, having been lucky enough to never\nneed further testing so far over my many years of these tests. Most people\nthink I'm nuts: What? Just get your mammo!Expand full commentLike\n(18)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n5 replies\n\n96 more comments...\n\nUK Now Reports Myocarditis stratified by Age & Sex After Vaccine Or Sars-cov-2\n\nNature Medicine paper revisited: And it is shocking\n\nDec 26, 2021 \u2022\n\nVinay Prasad\n\n438\n\nShare this post\n\n#### UK Now Reports Myocarditis stratified by Age & Sex After Vaccine Or Sars-\ncov-2\n\nwww.drvinayprasad.com\n\n24\n\nMask studies reach a new scientific low point\n\nMMWR appears to no longer be in the science business\n\nFeb 6, 2022 \u2022\n\nVinay Prasad\n\n537\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Mask studies reach a new scientific low point\n\nwww.drvinayprasad.com\n\n48\n\nBoosters do not work in people who have had COVID\n\nA new study from Austria looks at people who had COVID\n\nJan 21 \u2022\n\nVinay Prasad\n\n293\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Boosters do not work in people who have had COVID\n\nwww.drvinayprasad.com\n\n9\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Vinay Prasad\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
