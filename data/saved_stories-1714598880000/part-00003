New York\u2019s least likely media mogul was the mastermind\nbehind Environments, a series of records he swore were \u201cThe Future of Music.\u201d\nFrom 1969 to 1979, he took the best parts of nature, turned them up to 11,\nengraved them on 12-inch records, and sold them back to us by the millions. He\nhad a musician\u2019s ear, an artist\u2019s heart, and a salesman\u2019s tongue, and his work\nlives on in yoga studios, Skymall catalogs, and the sea-blue eyes of Brian\nEno. If you haven\u2019t heard of him, it\u2019s only because he designed his own legacy\nto be invisible.\n\nThis is the story of a man who tried to capture the world, and really wanted\nus to listen.\n\n## The Countercultural Sea\n\nThe liner notes and disc for Environments 1: \u201cThe Psychologically Ultimate\nSeashore/Optimum Aviary.\u201d Cara Giaimo\n\nATLAS OBSCURA COURSES\n\nLearn with Us!\n\nCheck out our lineup of courses taught by world-class experts from around the\nworld. See Courses\n\nIrving Solomon Teibel was born in Buffalo, New York, in 1938. Though his full\nname has a cadence any melodist would envy, everyone called him Irv. He took\nan early interest in preserving sound\u2014his childhood home was lively with\nclassical music, and he\u2019d bring recording equipment to his brother Phil\u2019s\nviolin concerts, to add them to the stacks.\n\nAs he got older, he zigzagged between disciplines and cities, picking up new\nmodes of apprehension and expression: applied science at Rochester Institute\nof Technology, photography at the Art Center School in Los Angeles, public\nrelations for the U.S. Army in Germany, publishing in London. While stationed\nin Stuttgart in the 1950s, he dug into the local scene, studying electronic\nmusic and splicing tape with fellow musique concr\u00e9te fans at a radio station.\nPromotion by day, sonic experiments by night\u2014Teibel may not have known it, but\nhe was building the toolkit he\u2019d call on to make Environments.\n\nBy 1965, he was 27 years old and a jack-of-all-trades Manhattanite. He wrote\nand photographed for magazines like Look and Car and Driver, designed record\njackets, and, after composer John Watts set up a synthesizer-based curriculum,\nstudied electronic music at the New School for Social Research. In his spare\ntime, he ogled fancy motorcycles, kept a running file of weird restaurants,\nand gigged around, helping his artist friends with their after-hours\nendeavors.\n\nTeibel recording in the British countryside in the late 1970s. Courtesy\nSyntonic Records\n\nIn short, like many young people in New York at the time, he was experimenting\nwith the array of different creative tools available to the growing\ncounterculture. Teibel\u2019s own calling manifested in 1968, as he crewed on a\nshoot for a feature called Coming Attractions. The film, directed by Tony and\nBeverly Grant Conrad, was a fantastical, dream-soaked portrait of a drag queen\nnamed Francis Francine, facing an uncertain future while haunted by a \u201cSpirit\nof Seductions Past.\u201d That same year, the Conrads\u2019 friend Walter de Maria\nreleased a disc called \u201cOcean Music,\u201d featuring 20 minutes of crashing surf.\nSeeking a similar sense of sonic restlessness, the directors sent Teibel to\nConey Island to record the waves off Brighton Beach.\n\nComing Attractions has a perfectly splotched 1960s art house pedigree: Tony\nConrad played violin with what would become The Velvet Underground, and\nBeverly Grant headlined films by notorious performance artist Jack Smith.\nFrancis Francine was a Warhol muse and and early genderqueer superstar, and\nWalter de Maria, already an up-and-coming sculptor, would soon make an\nindelible mark by filling a SoHo room with dirt. Even the Conrads\u2019 marriage\nwas somehow transgressive\u2014they got together after working together on a Smith\nfilm in which she played a cobra woman and he played a mummy, a decision that\ncaused Smith to disown them both for being too normal.\n\nThrown into this avant-garde who\u2019s-who, Teibel could have been starstruck.\nInstead, out angling his microphone at the Brighton Beach surf, he got\nseastruck. Teibel\u2019s roving mind craved a magnet\u2014he loved his sleepless city,\nbut it was no good for calming down, or corralling his thoughts. Even his\nhobbies had lost some luster. After years of manipulating noise for fun, he\ntold a friend, he suddenly \u201cfound it hard to do anything pleasant\u201d with it.\n\nThe sea sounds, though, were easy to love. Taken back to his Manhattan\napartment and looped on repeat, they were even better. They quieted his mind.\nThey helped him concentrate. They did something plain old human music\ncouldn\u2019t.\n\n## \u201cA Perfect Ocean\u201d\n\nSoon after his Brighton Beach breakthrough, Teibel went for his regular chess\ngame with a friend who worked in psychoacoustics, studying how sound affects\nthe nervous system. As Teibel later related in computer magazine Digital Deli,\nthis friend happened to bring up Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz, a\n19th-century German polymath who was convinced that natural sounds\u2014even those\nas mundane as the wind, or the sea\u2014might have \u201cgreat psychological benefits,\nif only some means of accurate reproduction could be found.\u201d\n\nA century after this speculation, such means were now old hat. Teibel had just\nused them to bottle the ocean. \u201cThis casual mention of Helmholtz\u2019 musings,\u201d he\nwrote, \u201ctriggered a \u2018what-if\u2019 that was to have a profound effect on the next\ndecade of my life.\u201d He later told his daughter that it was like \u201cwaking up and\nbeing on top of an elephant.\u201d\n\nTeibel informed the Conrads that he wanted to start a record label. When they\ndeclined to go in on it, he left their project and went back to the beach\nhimself.\n\nBut making the sounds he recorded match the sea in his head was no easy feat,\nand required a then-rare collaborator\u2014a computer.\n\nCompared to music, or spoken conversation, the ocean is \u201cnoisy,\u201d full of\nsurprising tones and frequencies your average microphone doesn\u2019t bother to\npreserve. And though the human ear is used to filling in gaps left by a choppy\nradio or telephone, Teibel found it to be much less forgiving when taking in\nnatural sounds. \u201cInto this maelstrom of inaccuracy I plunged with my trusty\nUher portable stereo reel-to-reel tape recorder and a tangle of microphones\nand cables,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNearly a year later I had produced a hundred stereo\nrecordings not one of which actually sounded, to my mind\u2019s eye, like the ocean\nI wanted to hear.\u201d\n\nLuckily for him, Teibel\u2019s perfectionism was matched by his roster of useful\nfriends. One in particular, Louis Gerstman, was working at Bell Labs,\ndeveloping computers that could recite Hamlet and sing children\u2019s songs in\norder to better understand speech. Gerstman had access to an IBM 360, a state-\nof-the-art machine in 1968. \u201cBring your ocean to me, and I\u2019ll save you grief,\u201d\nhe told Teibel.\n\nTeibel and Gerstman fed the original Brighton Beach tape into the computer\nand, after a night of parameter tweaks and range adjustments, came up with\nsomething promising\u2014\u201ca beautiful, tranquil ocean sound I had never heard\nbefore,\u201d Teibel wrote. The next night, they went at it again, adding delays\nand overdubs. When they finally had what they wanted, they realized it would\ntake eight hours to record their 30-minute sea to playback tape. \u201cWe set\neverything up, punched the record button, and spent the rest of the night\ndrinking coffee and munching greasy hamburgers at an all-night diner,\u201d Teibel\nwrote. When they went in at dawn to play it back, they found exactly what he\nhad wanted: \u201cA \u2018perfect\u2019 ocean in completely convincing stereo.\u201d\n\nThe cover of Environments 1. Cara Giaimo\n\n## \u201cBetter than a Tranquilizer\u201d\n\nPick up a copy of Environments 1, and you don\u2019t see any of its backstory.\nThere\u2019s no sign of the all-nighters, the stacks of failed beach tapes, or the\ngreasy burgers; no credits or place designations. In fact, Teibel\u2019s name\ndoesn\u2019t appear once.\n\nWhat you do see are promises, and lots of them. The front boasts the track\ntitles, all-caps beneath a long view of a foamy wave: \u201cSide 1: THE\nPSYCHOLOGICALLY ULTIMATE SEASHORE. Side 2: OPTIMUM AVIARY.\u201d Open the fold, and\nyou get four columns of instructional text, alternately self-assured (\u201cyou\nwill probably want to leave the record playing all the time\u201d) and overbearing\n(if such constant use grimes things up, \u201cuse tepid water and mild dishwashing\ndetergent to rinse the record.\u201d). The back fairly shouts with anonymous user\nreviews in bright colors: \u201cHAVEN\u2019T FELT SO GOOD SINCE MY VACATION\u201d; \u201ccured my\ninsomnia!\u201d; \u201cBETTER THAN A TRANQUILIZER.\u201d At the bottom, in a curlicue font,\nis the only mark of authorship: \u201cProduced by Syntonic Research, Inc.\u201d\n\nAfter hammering out the kinks in the seashore, Teibel took his reel-to-reel to\nthe Bronx Zoo and set it up near the birdcage. Voila: \u201cOptimum Aviary.\u201d But\neven with a set of perfect recordings, Teibel was only halfway done. He wanted\nto bring this discovery to the people; to share with his fellow stressed-out\nmasses the natural cure he\u2019d found within their city\u2019s limits. And an hour of\nsouped-up surf and enhanced chirps wasn\u2019t going to sell itself.\n\nThe back of Environments 1, featuring breathless testimonials and many, many\nfonts. Cara Giaimo\n\nSo Teibel reached back into his experience as an ad man, with the Army press\noffice and the London publishing house. Inspired by the word \u201cXerox,\u201d he\nbrainstormed a long list of intimidating, inscrutable names before settling on\none: \u201cSyntonic Research.\u201d He holed up again and wrote sheet after sheet of\ncopy, laying out the lab\u2019s supposed findings: \u201cIf used while reading,\ncomprehension and reading speed improve noticeably. If used at mealtime,\nappetites improve. Insomniacs fall asleep without the aid of drugs.\nHypertension vanishes. Student\u2019s marks improve. It\u2019s [sic] effect on the\nesthetics of lovemaking is truly remarkable.\u201d\n\nAs far as anyone can tell, save for the continued services of Gertsman and a\nColumbia University biologist named Louis Katz, Syntonic Research employed a\ndistinct lack of researchers. There were no white-coated acousticians\ndecanting different sounds, or stressed-out volunteers drinking them up. Odds\nare good that the unattributed testimonials could all have rightly been signed\n\u201cTeibel.\u201d\n\nThis is not to say such labs didn\u2019t exist. The mid-20th century saw a\nrevolution in indoor noise design; improvements in HVAC systems had helped\nwith climate control, but had also eliminated the ever-present hum that, it\nturned out, had been keeping an increasingly corporate America sane.\nAcousticians all over the country were frantically developing new types of\nsuper-specific white noise, trying to keep open-plan office workers from\ninvading each other\u2019s privacy with every phone call.\n\nMeanwhile, the 1970s brought us Earth Day, a celebration of environmentalism\nconcentrated chiefly in urban centers. Techhead hippies were reading the Whole\nEarth Catalogue, flipping from essays about cybernetics to treatises on how to\nbest hand-plow a field. Though plenty of other people had recorded rainforests\nand jungles, for folk collections or for posterity, no one had thought to\nsmooth them down for general indoor use.\n\nThe back of Environments 5: \u201cUltimate Heartbeat/Wind in the Trees,\u201d featuring\nmore rave reviews. Cara Giaimo\n\nWhen he did, Teibel was rewarded by the choosiest of trendsetters: college\nkids. As Teibel later told the New York Times, early test pressings displayed\nat the Harvard Coop outsold the Beatles at exam time, as students used\nrecorded surf to drown out noisy neighbors. Bolstered by this early success,\nin the summer of 1970, Atlantic Records & Tapes bought the rights, expanded\ndistribution, and embarked on a small marketing campaign. \u201cThis album contains\nno music, no singing, no spoken words,\u201d one ad begins, before this surprise\nkicker: \u201c...And it\u2019s one of the Hottest-sellers in the Underground!\u201d\n\nIn this way, Teibel gained not only a larger audience, but a posse of test\nsubjects, and life began to imitate art\u2014or at least to copy copy. He sent test\npressings to a select audience and solicited their feedback, and seeded record\nsleeves with mail-in questionnaires to gauge his audience\u2019s wants and needs.\nHe heard back from subjects as varied as overworked helicopter pilots and\nclergy seeking background sounds for sermons, and read their responses in his\nnew penthouse office in the Flatiron Building. Software designers used the\nrecords as mind-detanglers, and psychiatrists played them in waiting rooms.\nInevitably, his records began to replace nature itself: Retirees soaked their\nFlorida condos in his fake ocean, to avoid opening windows and letting in the\nreal damp.\n\nIn the subsequent decade, Teibel followed his fans\u2019 requests far and near.\nAfter noticing the importance of proper sound sequencing\u2014frogs, for instance,\nwill always call-and-respond from alternate sides of a lake\u2014he stopped\nlooping. He\u2019d record in his chosen spot for hours, whittle the tape down, and\npump it up. Environments 4: \u201cUltimate Thunderstorm\u201d sounds like a tree-shaking\ndeluge, but was captured from the bathroom of his Manhattan apartment. For\nenvironments 6: \u201cDawn and Dusk at Okefenokee Swamp,\u201d he took an airboat to the\nGeorgia-Florida border, accompanied only by a microphone and his Scottish\nterrier, Farfel, who was so well-trained he kept silent even when menaced by\nan alligator.\n\nAn image from an advertisement for Environments, c. 1970s. Courtesy Syntonic\nRecords\n\nOccasionally, Teibel ventured into more human territory. He recorded chanting\nsingers, and a Central Park Be-In. Some records were made to solve a special\nchallenge\u2014according to its jacket, environments 5: \u201cUltimate Heartbeat\u201d aimed\nto \u201cslow down and synchronize the act of lovemaking\u201d (though, as the New York\nTimes reported, \u201cthere is scarcely an environments record side that someone\nhasn\u2019t reported using to make love to\u201d). Others found niche audiences: played\nin an Arizona barracks, number 11, \u201cAlpine Blizzard\u201d supposedly cooled off\nsoldiers, and the thunderstorm was used to train skittish dogs. \u201cToday, we\nsell to everybody from precociously intelligent 13-year-olds to grandmothers\nwho use our records for knitting,\u201d Teibel told the Times in 1975, just after\nthe release of environments 8: \u201cWood-Masted Sailboat\u201d/\u201cA Country Stream.\u201d\n\nJournalists, coaxed into participation as part of their coverage, provide\nfirsthand accounts of the listening experience. \u201cThere is an over-all\npeaceful, detached effect,\u201d the New York Times reporter writes in 1975. \u201cWhile\nmy eyes are focused on a sheet of typing paper, I seem to be off somewhere\nelse.\u201d A New York magazine writer tasked with finding urban sleep solutions\ncompares it favorably with clinics and water beds. LIFE\u2019s reviewer takes\nthings one step further: \u201cCheaper than booze, safer than pot, less monotonous\nthan the hum of an air conditioner.\u201d Indeed, the only non-fan may have been\nLester Bangs, who included environments on a list of \u201cMost Ridiculous Records\nof the 70s,\u201d ranked slightly higher than a rock opera called \u201cCalifornia 99\u201d\nand slightly lower than \u201cThe Best of Marcel Marceau\u201d\u2014though even he allows\nthat \u201cplaying the surf noises on the first record absorbs the traffic noises\nand crime-of-violence shrieks penetrating apartment walls in New York City.\u201d\n\nBetween 1969 and 1979, Teibel released 11 environments LPs. Most sold well,\nthough none approached the success of \u201cThe Psychologically Ultimate Seashore,\u201d\nwhich moved enough units that he never had to work again. His records couldn\u2019t\ngo out of style, Teibel figured, because they were never in style in the first\nplace. They were functional items\u2014\u201clike a bar of soap,\u201d he said.\n\nThroughout all this success, Teibel himself stayed in the background. In the\nearly 1980s, he got married, moved to Austin, Texas and dove back into\nphotography, retouching photos on his very own Apple II and sharing them with\nfriends and neighbors. He had daughters, and then granddaughters. environments\nwas a fixture in their bedtimes\u2014\u201che would use Ultimate Thunderstorm, and Slow\nOcean, even the crickets,\u201d his daughter Jennifer told the BBC in 2012. He\nplayed them for himself, too.\n\nWhen Teibel died in 2010, at age 72, his family made him an online tribute\npage. Thus far, it has gathered five quiet testimonials from acquaintances and\nstrangers. \u201cI never realized it was ONE man that did this,\u201d wrote a fan named\nRoberta, who then told of tricking her mother with \u201cUltimate Thunderstorm:\u201d\n\u201cShe was completely convinced that it was going to downpour and ran around the\napartment closing windows... when she went to the back door to wait for the\nrain to begin she was puzzled by the sunshine.\u201d\n\n## \u201cHumans Don\u2019t Like Silence Very Much\u201d\n\nNearly half a century after its first release, \u201cThe Psychologically Ultimate\nSeashore\u201d seems a little washed up. The environments series has been out of\nprint for years, its spot at the Harvard Coop filled by neck pillows and\ndisposable earplugs. Teibel\u2019s Syntonic Records homepage, only accessible\nthrough the Internet Archive, is a fossil of the early web, with its grainy\nwaterfall image and acid-pink background. Dog-eared copies in used record\nstores look like what they are: 70s relics, bubbling over with dead slang and\ntrippy fonts.\n\nSome of the series\u2019 most dedicated fans, though, maintain that there\u2019s more to\nthe story. Hidden in the seashore\u2019s hiss, they say, run several of the\ncurrents shaping contemporary life.\n\nFirst of all, as Teibel sinks into something like obscurity, science is\nfinally catching up. Over the past couple of decades, researchers have been\ntrying to pin down whether and how well a good dose of outdoor audio actually\nworks for the mind\u2014and so far, evidence suggests there\u2019s something to it.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of discussion about different types of music, and what is\ncalming for one person may not be for for another person,\u201d says Jonas Braasch,\nan acoustician at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. \u201cBut nature sounds\u2014people\nseem to agree that they all like it.\u201d\n\nLast year, Braasch put some study subjects through a rigorous cognitive task\ninvolving number identification. Then he gave them a break, during which he\ntreated them to one of three auditory experiences: nature sounds, a loud\nindustrial woodshop, or nothing at all. When he made them repeat the same\ntask, those who had spent time in sonic nature improved the most.\n\nOther studies have uncovered measurable physiological effects. Upcoming\nresearch from the University of North Florida suggests that listening to ocean\nwaves can unclench muscles and slow down heart rates after just seven minutes,\nwhile Mozart and silence do nothing. In a 2003 study, patients undergoing\nbronchoscopies reported less pain and anxiety when the procedure had a woodsy\nsoundtrack. Some scientists have even suggested piping birdsong into urban\nenvironments, in order to boost general morale and overpower less pleasant\nsounds, like traffic.\n\nData like this can back up hunches, but much of the \u201cwhy\u201d is still left to\nspeculation. According to environmental psychologist Eleanor Ratcliffe, nature\nsounds may have certain inherently pleasant qualities, like repetition and\nslow rhythm, that help us tune out other distractions without demanding our\nattention themselves. Music, even when it strives to replicate these\nqualities, is too culturally specific to achieve this across the board.\n\nOthers think natural sounds evoke a sense of safety rooted in our prehistoric\ndays, when burbling brooks and talkative birds were a sign that all was well\nat home. \u201cHumans don\u2019t like silence very much,\u201d Braasch says. \u201cUsually if it\nbecomes very quiet, that\u2019s a good indicator that a predator is around. But if\nanimals and birds are making noise, you have a safe environment.\u201d Even in\ncontemporary cities, where lions and wolves are far less menacing than things\nlike stress and sleeplessness, this old message still comes through\u2014and, as\nTeibel so quickly realized, sound can help us fight those new threats, too.\n\nA selection of Environments albums, plus one other Teibel venture, \u201cThe\nErickson Tapes.\u201d Courtesy Jonathan Een Newton\n\n## The Forgotten Godfather\n\nTeibel\u2019s cultural reputation is quietly growing alongside his scientific one,\nthanks to historians and music buffs like Jonathan Een Newton. Een Newton,\nlike most new fans, first encountered environments by accident: While\nnurturing an interest in environmental folk recordings, he happened upon a\nbrief mention of Teibel in a magazine sidebar. This inspired an info-seeking\nblog post, which led to a phone call from Teibel\u2019s daughter Jennifer. Barely a\nyear later, he has found himself on the inside, one of a small group in charge\nof the Syntonic Research legacy.\n\nIt is, in his eyes, a major one. Teibel is a kind of auditory missing link.\n\u201cBefore, there\u2019s Muzak, there\u2019s mood music, and there\u2019s sound effects records.\nAfterwards, there\u2019s new age music, ambient music, Brian Eno... and he\u2019s right\nin between,\u201d Een Newton says. \u201cHe\u2019s a forgotten godfather.\u201d\n\nOther devotees place him at the top of different tradition. Mack Hagood, an\nassistant professor of media studies at Miami University, is writing a history\nof what he calls \u201corphic media\u201d\u2014\u201csound technologies that people use to create\na comfortable sense of space for themselves.\u201d In graduate school, he began\ncollecting examples of what would become his study subject: white noise\nmachines, noise-cancelling headphones, televisions left on to comfort a person\nalone in the house. \u201cAnd then I thought, \u2018oh my gosh, Environments, right!\u2019\u201d\nhe recalls. \u201cThese old friendly records completely fit the bill.\u201d\n\nThese days, a large swath of Teibel\u2019s legacy survives in the form of waterfall\nmachines from Sharper Image, or dozens of rainforest-themed chill-out apps.\nBut, Hagood points out, some of it has been lost, too, cut off by our current\nage\u2019s narrow bandwidth of values. Now, he says, \u201cit\u2019s all about sleep and\nconcentration\u201d\u2014the kind of attention-control that helps you work harder, or\nrelax better so as to work harder later. Scientific studies of nature sounds\nbear this out in their very construction, by focusing on increasing\nproductivity or decreasing workplace stress.\n\nWith Environments, Teibel certainly offers up better sleep and peak\nefficiency. But he also swears you\u2019ll trip with your friends, have better sex,\nand tap into some kind of blissed-out sky-high plane. His process, with its\ndual focus on realness and improvement, represents the kind of achievable\nidealism he hoped his records could engender in others. Tune in, and you could\nturn on, drop out, or shape up. \u201cThese records, they look super corny and\nsilly,\u201d Hagood says. \u201cBut I think we need to take them more seriously.\u201d\n\nEen Newton agrees. He\u2019s shining Environments up for the spotlight, working on\na website, a series of reissues, a documentary, and a lot of other \u201clittle\nprojects,\u201d he says. Part of this is revealing the man behind Syntonic\nResearch, an endeavor Teibel kept purposefully faceless. \u201cHe kind of did such\na good job with that that he wrote himself out of the story,\u201d Een Newton says.\nBig names call Teibel a spiritual forebear, he promises\u2014though he\u2019s taken a\nleaf out of his subject\u2019s book, dancing around specifics to keep the mystery\nfresh.\n\nPiecing it together hasn\u2019t been easy, but Een Newton has a good soundtrack to\nsearch by. For Christmas this past year, Jennifer sent him a complete set of\nEnvironments. Een Newton likes working with background music, and says it\u2019s\nlike having the real thing after years of making do with imitations. \u201cNow, you\ngo to Spotify or you go to Youtube and there\u2019s just a billion versions of rain\nsounds in a pine forest\u2014they\u2019re all copying his concept,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s like\npatient zero for all of that stuff.\u201d\n\nIrv Teibel in his office in the Flatiron Building, c. 1975. Courtesy Syntonic\nRecords\n\n## \u201cThe Music of the Future\u201d\n\nHow do Teibel\u2019s records sound now, fifty years past their commercial prime?\nEnvironments 1: \u201cThe Psychologically Ultimate Seashore\u201d is available on\nDiscogs for a few bucks. In our maximally efficient times, it\u2019s very easy to\norder one and follow the near-medicinal playback instructions. At regular\nspeed and volume, the disc is crisp enough to drown out car horns, roommates,\nand home screen notifications. It seems to unroll forever. An occasional\nfoghorn punctuates, far off. There\u2019s nothing particularly utopian about it,\nbut nothing particularly retro, either.\n\nEventually, all the music of the future becomes the music of the past, even if\nit was never music to begin with. A phrase like \u201cTotally New Concepts\u201d starts\nreading as parody. We begin using tranquilizers again after all.
