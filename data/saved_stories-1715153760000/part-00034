In addition to\nthe generic title of ariki, which is worn at the end of one's name, each\nchiefly line carries its own unique style, which is placed at the beginning.\nThus, if the chief's name is \"Henry\" and his title is \"Ngamaru\", he is styled\n\"Ngamaru Henry Ariki\".\n\nState| Polity| Monarch| Since| House| Succession| Refs  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nCook Islands| Aitutaki| Manarangi Tutai Ariki| 2000| Vaipaepae o Pau|\nHereditary| ^[30]  \nTamatoa Purua Ariki| Hereditary| ^[31]  \nVaeruarangi Teaukura Ariki| Hereditary| ^[32]  \nAtiu| Parua Mataio Kea Ariki| Nurau| Hereditary| ^[33]  \nRongomatane Ada Ariki ^[oc 29]| 1972| Paruarangi| Hereditary| ^[30]  \nNgamaru Tupuna Ariki| 2021| Te Akatuira| Hereditary| ^[34]  \nMangaia| Numangatini Tereapii Ariki| 29 August 2020| Nga Ariki| Hereditary|\n^[35]  \nManihiki ^[oc 30]| Te Fakaheo Ariki ^[oc 31]| Hukutahu ^[oc 32]| Hereditary|\n^[32]^[36]  \nVacant ^[oc 33]| Matangaro ^[oc 34]| Hereditary  \nMauke| Tamuera Ariki ^[oc 35]| Nurau| Hereditary| ^[33]  \nTararo Temaeva Ariki ^[oc 36]| Paruarangi| Hereditary| ^[32]  \nTe Au Marae Ariki| Te Akatuira| Hereditary| ^[37]  \nMitiaro| Tou Travel Ariki| Nurau| Hereditary| ^[31]  \nTetava Poitirere Ariki| Paruarangi| Hereditary| ^[32]  \nTemaeu Teikamata Ariki| 20 February 1985^[38]| Te Akatuira| Hereditary| ^[32]  \nPukapuka| Aliki Makirai Henry| June 2022| Pukapuka| Hereditary| ^[39]  \nRarotonga| Makea Vakatini Phillip Ngamatoa Ariki| 20 July 2020| Te Au o Tonga|\nHereditary| ^[40]  \nGeorge Taripo Karika Ariki| 13 December 2018| Hereditary| ^[41]  \nVacant ^[oc 37]| 1994| Hereditary| ^[42]^[43]^[44]^[45]  \nPa Tapaeru Marie Ariki ^[oc 38]| 27 June 1990| Takitumu| Hereditary| ^[30]  \nKainuku Kapiriterangi Ariki| 6 May 2006| Hereditary| ^[46]  \nTinomana Tokerau Ariki| 21 Nov 2013| Puaikura ^[oc 39]| Hereditary| ^[30]  \n  \n### Others[edit]\n\nIn Fiji, which became a colony of the United Kingdom in 1874, the British\nmonarchs were historically bestowed the title Tui Viti, which translates as\n\"King of Fiji\" or \"Paramount Chief of Fiji\". The last holder of the title\n(from 6 February 1952) was Queen Elizabeth II, of the House of Windsor. The\nstate became a republic in 1987, abolishing the title by establishing a new\nconstitution. The former Great Council of Chiefs, however, still recognised\nElizabeth II as Tui Viti, as the nation's traditional queen and its supreme\ntribal chief, despite no longer holding a constitutional office. Consequently,\nwhile Fiji remains a republic, a monarch or paramount chief is still\nrecognised by traditional tribal politics. The Queen made no official claim to\nthe Tui Viti throne, although until at least 2002, she remained open to the\npossibility of a constitutional restoration of the monarchy.^[47]\n\nNative chiefs in Fiji are considered members of the nobility. The House of\nChiefs, consisting of about 70 chiefs of various rank determined by a loosely\ndefined order of precedence, was modeled after the British House of\nLords.^[48] Tongan chiefs, subordinate to a king, are also considered nobles\nand have therefore been excluded from the above list.^[49]\n\nIn American Samoa there are 14 paramount chiefs, with Manu'a traditionally\nsubordinate to the Tu'i Manu'a, a title that is now considered purely\nhistorical; the last titleholder, Elisala, died 2 July 1909. The paramount\nchiefly titles are: on Tutuila, Faumuina, Lei'ato, Letuli, Fuimaono, Tuitele,\nSatele, Mauga, and in the Manu'a Islands, Laolagi, Aso'au, Lefiti, Sotoa,\nGalea'i, Misa and Tuiolosega.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Ethnarch\n  * Heads of former ruling families\n  * Imperial, royal and noble ranks\n  * List of current monarchs of sovereign states\n  * List of current reigning monarchs by length of reign\n  * List of monarchies\n  * Lists of monarchs\n  * Traditional authority\n  * List of current sovereign monarchs\n  * List of longest reigning current monarchs\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n### North America[edit]\n\n### Oceania[edit]\n\n  1. ^ The government of the Marshall Islands recognises 12 chiefly domains, called mojen, each headed by one or several paramount chiefs. Each domain is represented in the Council of Iroij, an advisory body of traditional chiefs guaranteed by the Constitution.\n  2. ^ This domain covers the islands of Ailuk, Aur, Maloelap, Taongi, Utirik and Wotje in the Ratak Chain. Its ruling clan has also laid claim to nearby Wake Island, under the name Eneen-Kio.\n  3. ^ This chief is normally referred to as the Isipahu.\n  4. ^ The ruling line belongs specifically to the Inenkatau (or Upwutenmai) sept of the Dipwinpahnmei clan.\n  5. ^ This chief is normally referred to as the Sangiro.\n  6. ^ The ruling line belongs specifically to the Sounpasedo sept of the Lasialap clan.\n  7. ^ Hilarion was recognised as grand chef in 1974, but, due to a violent succession dispute with his relative Jean-Marie Vend\u00e9gou, was not formally enthroned until 7 July 1979. He is also the mayor of the island commune until 2014.\n  8. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b A Kanak dynasty.\n  9. ^ The Naisseline family is a branch of the Netch\u00e9, a tribe of Kanaks.\n  10. ^ The throne of the grand chef on Mar\u00e9 Island is traditionally held by the chief of Guahma district, an hereditary position.\n  11. ^ The throne of the grand chef on Lifou Island, which also rules Ouv\u00e9a, is traditionally held by the chief of L\u00f6ssi district, an hereditary position.\n  12. ^ Commonly referred to as the \"M\u0101ori King Movement\". Its elected ariki nui is often called the \"M\u0101ori King\" due to his nationalistic influence over all M\u0101ori tribes as a symbol of unity. This title is not officially recognised by the government of New Zealand.\n  13. ^ Te Wherowhero is the lineage of the first king. It belongs to the Waikato iwi, which is part of the Tainui confederation.\n  14. ^ The monarch is appointed for life by the chiefs of the tribes involved in the K\u012bngitanga movement. Traditionally, selection is limited to direct descendants of the first king: P\u014dtatau I, of the Waikato tribe. However, in principle inheritance is open to any lineage should the electing chiefs be in agreement.\n  15. ^ Palau is divided into 16 traditional polities. The 16-seat Council of Chiefs, made up of the traditional chiefs from each constituent state, is an advisory body to the President. The chiefs of Koror and Melekeok, the highest chiefs from Eoueldaob and Babeldaob respectively, are recognised as the two paramount chiefs of the nation.\n  16. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b This is not the name of the ruling house or clan: it is the ritual name used by the successive chiefs from this lineage.\n  17. ^ Jump up to: ^a ^b Chiefs are selected by the most senior women of the ruling clan.\n  18. ^ There are four paramount chiefs in Samoa, each presiding over a royal lineage (Tama a '\u0100iga) of past kings. Chiefs are afforded considerable power. The national parliament, the Fono, is composed exclusively of chiefly titleholders (matai). The office of head of state (the O le Ao o le Malo) is traditionally reserved for the paramount chiefs, although this is not required by the Constitution.\n  19. ^ Tufuga Efi has held the chiefly title of Tui Atua Fa'asavali since 1 July 1983.\n  20. ^ Va'aletoa Sualauvi has been the head of state since 21 July 2017.\n  21. ^ The throne of the Mata'afa has been vacant since 1997; little other information is available.\n  22. ^ The lineage associated with this title consists of three branches: Sa Moli, Sa Talavou and Sa Natuitasina (also spelled Gatuitasina). As the succession law dictates, heirs of all three branches are equally entitled to hold the title, and accession of an heir to the title is subject to nomination and consensus from all three branches. The most recent titleholders have been from the Moli sept.\n  23. ^ Each island or atoll has a traditional high chief, the ulu-aliki, who is recognised by and plays an active ceremonial role in the national government. Thrones are primarily elective, but candidates are limited to members of a number of chiefly clans.\n  24. ^ Funafuti's traditional chieftaincy is limited to senior members of two chiefly clans: Te Aliki a Mua, and Te Aliki a Muli. By custom, succession rotates between the two lineages.\n  25. ^ The high chief, or Pulefenua, is elected by a council of chiefs (the Fale Kaupule) from senior members of Nanumea's seven chiefly clans, all of which claim descent from the first settlers.\n  26. ^ The king is elected by a council of chiefs from the senior members of the kingdom's four chiefly clans.\n  27. ^ The king is elected by a council of chiefs from the senior members of the kingdom's three chiefly clans: the Tamole, the Keletaona, and the Safoka.\n  28. ^ The king is elected, traditionally for ten years, by a council of ministers from the senior members of the kingdom's royal clans. These clans correspond to the three districts of the island: Hahake, Hihifo, and Mu\u02bba. The present king is of the Hihifo clan.\n  29. ^ Her full name is \"Ada Teaupurepure Tetupu\".\n  30. ^ The two high chiefs on Manihiki also traditionally reign over neighbouring Rakahanga. They represent the populace of both islands in the area Ariki.\n  31. ^ The title is also often written as Whakaheo Ariki.\n  32. ^ Arikis of this line belong to either the Numatua or Tiangarotonga tribes.\n  33. ^ The throne of Te Faingaitu Ariki (alternatively Whaingaitu) is vacant. It is apparently disputed between members of the eligible tribes, but no information is available on the claimants.\n  34. ^ Arikis of this line belong to either the Heahiro or Mokopuwai tribes.\n  35. ^ Sources are unclear on the name of the current Tamuera Ariki (often written Samuela Ariki).\n  36. ^ His name is sometimes written \"Te Maeva\" or simply \"Maeva\".\n  37. ^ The Makea Nui Ariki is one of three high chiefs in the Te Au o Tonga tribe on Rarotonga. The previous ariki died in 1994, and her successor has yet to be agreed upon. Several members of the tribe claim rightful inheritance of the title. Succession is traditionally limited to the Rangi Makea clan; the three other clans of the tribe (Sadaraka, Mere and Upokotokoa) are considered junior branches. Mere Maraea MacQuarrie, the youngest daughter of the last ariki, is the only known claimant from the Rangi Makea clan, and is apparently the contender most likely to be granted the title. Other contenders include Stanley Adam Hunt, Yolande Browne, and Matapo Oti Oti, all of whom claim descent from the earlier arikis. The first of these, Hunt, was \"invested\" with the Makea Nui title under the regnal name \"Takaia Tutavake\"; the ceremony, which took place 16 May 2009, was not recognised by the government.\n  38. ^ Her full regnal name is \"Tapaeru Teariki Upokotini Marie\", most commonly known as \"Pa Marie\".\n  39. ^ There are three separate lineages eligible for the Puaikura Royalty, all of which descend from Tinomana Enuarurutini (ca. 1820\u20131854) the King of Puaikura and one of his three wives. They are (in order of seniority): Te Pori a Pa, Oakirangi, and Akaiti a Rua. The current Tinomana Ariki revert to the first and only married wive \"Te Pori a Pa line\".\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"After Landmark Territorial Win, Naso People of Panama Look to the Future\".
