From 1996-2007, Palm dominated the pocket computer marketplace\nand ushered in the modern smartphone era years before it became mainstream.\nOriginally marketed as business devices dubbed \"personal digital assistants\"\n(or PDAs), Palm found unexpected popularity in the home as well, with a vast\nlibrary of apps and games arising for use both in and out of the office.\nFuture models would go on to be some of the first smartphones ever made.\n\n# The Palm Company\n\nPalm Computing, Inc. was founded in 1992 by Jeff Hawkins, originally to write\nsoftware for other companies exploring the then-new field of pocket computing\ndevices. When these other devices failed, Palm embarked on the journey to\ncreate their own, culminating in the release of the Palm Pilot 1000 in 1996.\n\nThough primitive by today's standards, the Pilot featured very competitive\nspecs for the time, offering a 16 MHz processor; upgradeable memory starting\nat 128KB; a 160x160 monochrome display; and most importantly, a resistive\ntouchscreen supporting stylus input for navigation and handwriting recognition\nthrough Palm's Graffiti software. Future models would go on to offer faster\nprocessors, more memory, and vibrant color displays up to 320x480 in\nresolution.\n\nUnlike modern smartphones, Palm was designed to be a companion to a PC,\nfeaturing desktop software for synchronizing contacts, to-do lists, memos,\ncalendars, and even emails and Microsoft Office documents. Some could even\nconnect to the internet directly, or store images, music, and movies on\nexternal SD cards.\n\nThe operating system, simply named Palm OS, was incredibly flexible, and\nneatly balanced closed source code with an open ecosystem. Nearly any part of\nthe OS could be modified by third-party apps, leading to a thriving catalog of\nenhancements and addons, not to mention custom spins on the user experience by\nhardware manufacturers like Sony, Fossil, and Tapwave. For more than a decade,\nPalm OS was a hotbed for innovation and creativity.\n\nUnfortunately, in the late 2000s, Palm Computing suffered under a variety of\nacquisitions and subsequent mismanagement that left Palm OS to stagnate. In\n2009, the company emerged again with webOS, a competitor to Apple and Android\nsmartphones with modern hardware and software features. Although webOS proved\nagain to be highly influential, it failed to compete in the modern smartphone\nmarket and again fell prey to acquisitions which ultimately led to its demise.\n\nToday, Palm's legacy lives on in the open source edition of webOS, now owned\nby LG, where it is used in some models of smart TVs. In 2018, Chinese\ncorporation TCL acquired the rights to the Palm brand and created the Palm\nVentures Group, which developed a tiny, Android-based Palm \"companion\" phone.\n\n# The PalmDB Community\n\nPalmDB is focused on preserving the earlier days of Palm; its apps, and its\noperating system. By the late 2010s, most websites for distributing Palm\nsoftware had shut down or simply removed the content in favor of more modern\nalternatives. Although it is said the internet never forgets, for a time,\nPalm's history was in grave danger of being lost. Recognizing the threat,\nPalmDB was founded in 2018 with the intent to gather what remained and bring\nit back online. But in the end, it became so much more.\n\nThrough community forums like /r/Palm and Discord, more people than ever are\nrediscovering Palm OS and rallying around PalmDB and its sister projects in\nsupport of our mission. Together, we've collected thousands of apps, made them\neasily discoverable and accessible once again, and even created platforms for\nexperiencing them on modern PCs and smartphones.\n\nToday there are more than 3.5 billion smartphone users in the world--and\ncounting. If you're one of them, the history of Palm is your history. At\nPalmDB, we believe this history deserves to be remembered and made available\nto all, both today and well into the future.\n\nCan't find it?
