Normally this is\npopulated by whichever Windows flavours come on the install medium, but [Naman\nSood] has other ideas. How about a Windows installer with Alpine Linux as one\nof the choices? Sounds good to us.\n\nYou can see it in action in the video below the break. Indeed Alpine Linux\nappears as one of the choices, followed by the normal Windows licence accept\nscreen featuring the GPL instead of any MS text. The rest of the installer\ntalks about installing Windows, but we can forgive it not expecting a Linux\ninstall instead.\n\nSo, the question we\u2019re all asking is: how is it done? The answer lies in a WIM\nfile, a stock Windows image which the installer unpacks onto your hard drive.\nThe Linux distro needs to be installable onto an NTFS root partition, and to\nmake it installable there\u2019s a trick involving the Windows pre-installation\nenvironment.\n\nThis is an amusing hack, but the guide admits it\u2019s fragile and perhaps not the\nmost useful. Even so, the sight of Linux in a Windows installer has to be\nworth it.\n\nPosted in Linux Hacks, Software HacksTagged linux, OS install, windows\n\n## 4 thoughts on \u201cThis Windows Installer Installs Linux\u201d\n\n  1.

But if you want to indulge in that\nperversion, ext4 supports it via /sys/fs/ext4/features/casefold\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a ReplyCancel reply\n\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.\n(Comment Policy)\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
