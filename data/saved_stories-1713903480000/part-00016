Several experts say the US is not\nsharing enough information from the federal investigation into the unexpected\nand growing outbreak, including genetic information from isolated viruses.\n\nTo date, the US Department of Agriculture has tallied 32 affected herds in\neight states: Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South\nDakota, and Texas. In some cases, the movement of cattle between herds can\nexplain the spread of the virus. But the USDA has not publicly clarified if\nall the herds are linked in a single outbreak chain or if there is evidence\nthat the virus has spilled over to cows multiple times. Early infections in\nTexas were linked to dead wild birds (pigeons, blackbirds, and grackles) found\non dairy farms. But the USDA reportedly indicated to Stat News that the\ninfections do not appear to be all linked to the Texas cases.\n\nSpread of the virus via cattle movements indicates that there is cow-to-cow\ntransmission occurring, the USDA said. But it's unclear how the virus is\nspreading between cows. Given that even the most symptomatic cows show few\nrespiratory symptoms, the USDA speculates that the most likely way it is\nspreading is via contaminated milking equipment.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty of the virus's spread, The New York Times on Friday\nreported that the one herd found infected with H5N1 in North Carolina showed\nno symptoms of the virus. This raises the possibility that the virus could be\nsilently spreading in unknown numbers of other asymptomatic herds and states.\nIn its most recent FAQ document, the USDA encouraged testing for H5N1 if herds\nshow clinical symptoms, such as lethargy, fever, low milk production, and\nloose stools. But the Times noted that the agency has begun reimbursing farms\nfor testing asymptomatic cows.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, the USDA also reported that it has evidence that H5N1 from dairy\nfarms has spread back into birds in nearby poultry farms, but how this is\nhappening is also unknown.\n\n## Data gaps\n\nAll the uncertainty and widespread transmission raises concern about how the\nvirus is evolving to infect mammals and whether it is heading for humans. Last\nweek, the chief scientist for the World Health Organization, Jeremy Farrar,\ntold reporters in Geneva that the spread of the virus in US dairy cows is an\n\"enormous concern,\" according to CNN. \"The great concern, of course, is that\nin doing so and infecting ducks and chickens\u2014but now increasingly mammals\u2014that\nthat virus now evolves and develops the ability to infect humans. And then\ncritically, the ability to go from human-to-human transmission.\"\n\nIn particular, experts are wary that the dairy cow outbreaks could spill over\nto nearby pig farms as it's doing with nearby poultry farms. Pigs can be\ninfected with both bird flu viruses and human flu viruses, making them\npotential melting pots for new recombinant flu strains.\n\nSo far, the USDA says that genetic sequences of H5N1 viruses infecting cows\nhas not revealed any mutations that \"would make it more transmissible to\nhumans and between people.\" But last Thursday, Stat reported that\ninternational experts have faulted the USDA for not sharing more genetic data\nfrom its investigation, among other information. Until this weekend, the\nagency had only shared a few genetic sequences in an international database of\nviral genome sequences (GISAID).\n\n\"A country with capacity like the United States should be able to generate\nthis information within days,\" Marion Koopmans, head of the department of\nviroscience at Erasmus Medical Center in the Dutch city of Rotterdam, told\nStat last week. \"I would expect very fast, very transparent updates, and it\u2019s\nsomewhat amazing not to see that happening.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Sunday, facing mounting criticism, the USDA announced the release of 239\ngenetic sequences to GISAID. It noted it is also adding raw data to a US\nfederal database \"in the interest of public transparency and ensuring the\nscientific community has access to this information as quickly as possible.\"\nThe agency said it will continue to make such data available on a rolling\nbasis.\n\nDr. Rosemary Sifford, the USDA's chief veterinarian, told the Times, \"Please\nrecall that we\u2019ve been engaged in this for less than a month. We are working\nvery hard to generate more information,\" she said.\n\nOverall, the USDA and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\ncontinue to consider the risk to the public to be low. Farmworkers and others\nwho have direct contact with infected animals are encouraged to take\nprecautions, however.\n\nWhile deadly to birds, H5N1 in cows is relatively mild, rarely if ever causing\ndeaths. Milk from sick animals contains high levels of virus, but it is being\ndestroyed. Even if some infected milk makes its way into the milk supply, the\nFood and Drug Administration is confident that the virus would be killed in\nthe pasteurization process. \"Pasteurization has continually proven to\ninactivate bacteria and viruses, like influenza, in milk,\" the agency said in\nan FAQ Friday. Some experts have called for data confirming this, though.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### What Happens to the Developers When AI Can Code? | Ars Frontiers\n\n#### reader comments\n\n92\n\nBeth Mole Beth is Ars Technica\u2019s Senior Health Reporter.
