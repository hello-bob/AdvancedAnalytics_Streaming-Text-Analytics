A number of protocols have been\nproposed to achieve permissionless consensus, most notably based on the\nBitcoin protocol; however, to date no protocol is known that can be provably\ninstantiated outside of the random oracle model. In this work, we take the\nfirst steps towards achieving permissionless consensus in the standard model.\nIn particular, we demonstrate that worst-case conjectures in fine-grained\ncomplexity, in particular the orthogonal vectors conjecture (implied by the\nStrong Exponential Time Hypothesis), imply permissionless consensus in the\nrandom beacon model\u2014a setting where a fresh random value is delivered to all\nparties at regular intervals. This gives a remarkable win-win result: either\npermissionless consensus exists relative to a random beacon, or there are non-\ntrivial worst-case algorithmic speed-ups for a host of natural algorithmic\nproblems (including SAT). Our protocol achieves resilience against adversaries\nthat control an inverse-polynomial fraction of the honest computational power,\ni.e., adversarial power for some constant , where denotes the honest\ncomputational power. This relatively low threshold is a byproduct of the slack\nin the fine-grained complexity conjectures. One technical highlight is the\nconstruction of a Seeded Proof of Work: a Proof of Work where many\n(correlated) challenges can be derived from a single short public seed, and\nyet still no non-trivial amortization is possible.\n\n##### Metadata\n\nAvailable format(s)\n\n    PDF\nCategory\n\n    Cryptographic protocols\nPublication info\n\n    Preprint.\nKeywords\n\n    Consensusproof of workfine-grained complexity\nContact author(s)\n\n    marshall ball @ cs nyu edu garay @ cse tamu edu pf2184 @ nyu edu aggelos kiayias @ ed ac uk pagio91i @ gmail com\nHistory\n\n    2024-04-26: approved\n    2024-04-25: received\n    See all versions\nShort URL\n\n    https://ia.cr/2024/637\nLicense\n\n    CC BY\n\nBibTeX\n\n    \n    \n    @misc{cryptoeprint:2024/637, author = {Marshall Ball and Juan Garay and Peter Hall and Aggelos Kiayias and Giorgos Panagiotakos}, title = {Towards Permissionless Consensus in the Standard Model via Fine-Grained Complexity}, howpublished = {Cryptology ePrint Archive, Paper 2024/637}, year = {2024}, note = {\\url{https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/637}}, url = {https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/637} }\n\nNote: In order to protect the privacy of readers, eprint.iacr.org does not use\ncookies or embedded third party content.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
