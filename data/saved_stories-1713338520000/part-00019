But a new take on an old energy source may soon ease the\nburden.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Pentagon's Defense Innovation Unit announced that it is\ndoubling to six the number of technology companies involved in a project to\ntry out advances in geothermal energy, which draws upon liquid heated by the\nEarth, is carbon neutral, and doesn\u2019t require long and vulnerable supply\nlines.\n\n\u201cWith the addition of three more novel technology companies in this\n\u2018groundbreaking\u2019 initiative, DoD is doubling its efforts to leverage\nadvancements in geothermal commercial technologies for energy resilience and\nsupport DoD carbon free energy goals,\u201d Michael Callahan, the project manager\nfor the Defense innovation Unit\u2019s energy portfolio, said in a statement.\n\nThe idea of using the Earth\u2019s heat to produce energy goes back centuries.\nVikings used it for bathing and to heat homes before Icelanders used it to run\nturbines and produce electric power. But not every place can be Iceland, which\nboasts abundant underground water as well as high geothermal activity.\n\nNew techniques called engineered and advanced geothermal systems are greatly\nexpanding the areas where the Earth\u2019s heat can be tapped for power.\n\nWith engineered, Callahan said, \u201cYou're providing the fluids. You're drilling\ndeep enough into the earth to pump fluids into the earth and extracting the\nsame fluids that you use to generate electricity. And then \u2018advanced\u2019 is where\nyou have a closed-loop system\u201d that reuses fluid \u201cso it doesn't come in\ncontact with the reservoir.\u201d\n\nAnd AI tools are helping to identify places with safe, close-to-the-surface\ngeothermal activity.\n\nLast September, the Defense Innovation Unit announced the hiring of three\ncompanies: Eaver Inc., Teverra, and Zanksar at four U.S. Air Force and U.S.\nArmy installations in Alaska, California, Idaho, and Texas.\n\nThey will now be joined by Fervo Energy, GreenFire Energy, and Sage Geosystems\nfor new projects at Naval Air Station Fallon, Nevada; Naval Air Facility El\nCentro, California; and the Army\u2019s Fort Bliss in Texas.\n\nStory Continues Below Sponsor Message\n\nStory Continues Below Sponsor Message\n\nRight now, the power from geothermal energy is limited. Last summer, Fervo\nsaid its Utah system had reached 3.5 megawatts, enough to power a small town\nor a Google data center. That amount of power could also keep a Pacific island\ninstallation fighting in the event of cyberattack or fuel-supply disruption.\n\nCompared to other forms of energy, geothermal presents far fewer supply and\nresupply issues. There\u2019s also no concern that by acquiring it, the Defense\nDepartment may be giving an economic boost to a potential adversary. Russia,\nfor instance, is paying for its war against Ukraine with money it derives\nselling oil. Even solar power relies heavily on components from China. None of\nthose concerns are present with geothermal energy, said Callahan.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no critical materials issue, you know, like with batteries and energy\nstorage. It's all local,\u201d he said.\n\nCallahan said big tech companies\u2019 interest in geothermal power is helping to\ngive the nascent industry new support. But it\u2019s still a capital-intensive\nindustry, which can limit its appeal, especially among venture capital\ninvestors who are used to the relative ease of funding software companies.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s drilling rigs, infrastructure, transformers, power plants. So it's a\nsignificant valley of death, a big valley, compared to a software startup,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nThat\u2019s part of the reason why government investment, through the Defense\nDepartment but also the Department of Energy and other sources, is so critical\nto bring next-generation geothermal power to a new phase, increasing its\ndesirability to tech companies and investors, Callahan said.\n\n\u201cThere's been challenges with capital. And having these agreements, having\nreal-world projects and the DoD involvement, is a help to these\norganizations,\u201d he said.\n\nShare This:\n\nNEXT STORY: To adapt command posts to modern war, Army wants more commercial\ntech\n\nThe Air Force is quietly revolutionizing parts replacement\n\nPentagon will use commercial space assets in military operations, under new\nplan\n\nMoscow attack shows growing reach of ISIS-K.
