Credit: Redwire Space\n\nKissimmee, Fla. \u2013 SabreSat, Redwire Space\u2019s satellite for very low Earth\norbit, looks more like a dart than a traditional spacecraft.\n\n\u201cAs you think about aerodynamics, you want the dart to be skinny and long, not\nstubby and fat,\u201d Spence Wise, Redwire senior vice president for missions and\nplatforms, told SpaceNews.\n\nRedwire is designing SabreSat for government intelligence, surveillance and\nreconnaissance missions.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to bring one of those multimillion dollar payloads into\nVLEO just to have it deorbit,\u201d Wise said. \u201cSo we\u2019re building a persistent\nplatform capable of delivering on the customer\u2019s needs for exquisite\npayloads.\u201d\n\n#### VLEO Advantages\n\nIn recent years, companies have worked to establish constellations at\naltitudes ranging from 250 to 400 kilometers to gather high-resolution Earth\nimagery and to provide low-latency communications.\n\nRedwire sees advantages for national security satellites to operate at VLEO\naltitudes from 90 to 350 kilometers.\n\n\u201cGetting twice as close gives you a 400 percent improvement in your sensor\nperformance for electro-optical, infrared and all sorts of applications that\nthe U.S. government is interested in,\u201d Wise said.\n\nFlying above uncrewed aerial vehicles and below proliferated low-Earth orbit\nconstellations offers resiliency too, said Dean Bellamy Redwire executive vice\npresident for national security space.\n\nIf collisions occur or antisatellite weapons strike targets in traditional\nlow-Earth orbits, VLEO satellites would not be affected.\n\n\u201cWe call it the orbital drone. It offers a new capability,\u201d Bellamy said.\n\n#### SabreSat and SkimSat\n\nRedwire CEO Peter Cannito announced SabreSat during a March earnings call. At\nthe time, he cited the importance for Redwire of moving up the value chain\nfrom supplying components to delivering spacecraft.\n\nSabreSat benefits from expertise in Redwire\u2019s European arm. The former QinetiQ\nSpace, acquired by Redwire in 2022, is working with Thales Alenia Space on\nSkimSat, a VLEO platform for Earth-observation applications funded by the\nEuropean Space Agency.\n\nSkimSat and SabreSat rely on electric propulsion to compensate for drag in\nVLEO.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently working on the design phase for our VLEO platform on the\nEuropean front,\u201d Juan Pablo Ramos, Redwire Space business development manager,\nsaid in April at the 39^th Space Symposium in Colorado Springs. \u201cWe are\nfocusing on sustaining operations in VLEO as long as possible.\u201d\n\n#### Air-Breathing Option\n\nIn addition to standard electric thrusters, Redwire is offering customers an\nair-breathing option for SabreSat.\n\n\u201cDepending on the duration of the mission, we have the ability to scoop atomic\noxygen and nitrogen to utilize in our electric thrusters,\u201d Wise said. Solar\npanels provide additional power.\n\nSabreSat is designed with bulkheads. When customers need more payload capacity\nthan a 200-kilogram SabreSat provides, Redwire adds bulkheads to the center of\nthe satellite, maintaining the dart-like shape. Extending the satellite\u2019s\nlength also increases available power. Solar arrays mounted on the edges scale\nwith the length, Wise said.\n\n#### Digital Engineering\n\nThrough digital engineering, Redwire is exploring SabreSat configurations for\nvarious altitudes.\n\n\u201cWe created a plugin that allows us to model the drag of sparse gas as you\ntravel through the thermosphere,\u201d Wise said.\n\nAt certain altitudes, \u201cwe can collect more atomic oxygen and nitrogen than we\nwould actually expel,\u201d Wise said, \u201cwhich means that in theory, you can\nentirely maneuver without regret, make various maneuvers, orbit changes and so\nforth.\u201d\n\nBecause SabreSat relies on electric thrusters, the maneuvers will take time.\n\u201cBut it is a unique capability,\u201d Wise said.\n\n### Related\n\n#### Eyes in the sky: The increasing importance of very low Earth orbit (VLEO)\nfor national security\n\nAs space gets more crowded, very low Earth orbit (VLEO) will be a critical\ndomain for military Earth observation.\n\n#### Redwire looks to larger deals and new markets to fuel growth\n\nSpace infrastructure company Redwire plans to continue its growth and its push\nto profitability by seeking larger contracts for its lines of components while\nmoving up the value chain, including a new satellite design.\n\n#### Redwire to provide components for Blue Ring transfer vehicle\n\nRedwire will provide solar panels and other components for Blue Ring, an\norbital transfer vehicle under development by Blue Origin.\n\nTagged: Earth observation, Military Space, Redwire, VLEO\n\n## Debra Werner\n\nDebra Werner is a correspondent for SpaceNews based in San Francisco.
