Spotify Portal for Backstage is coming! Join our April 30\nwebinar to learn more Learn more\n\n# Supercharged Developer Portals\n\nApril 30, 2024 Published by Pia Nilsson, Senior Director of Engineering,\nPlatform Developer Experience\n\nToday, we announced Spotify\u2019s latest products and services for companies\nadopting Backstage, the open source framework for building internal developer\nportals (IDPs). Whether your company needs a highly customized IDP built from\nscratch or an out-of-the-box solution that\u2019s ready to go ASAP, we want to make\nit easy for anyone to maximize the value they get from their Backstage\ndeveloper portal. You can watch today\u2019s Spotify for Backstage roadmap webinar\nbelow to see how our latest tools help other companies build like Spotify \u2014 by\nprioritizing developer experience and developer productivity.\n\nWatch Spotify\u2019s Backstage team introduce our latest enterprise developer\ntools.\n\n## Every company is a tech company\n\nNo matter what business you\u2019re in, you\u2019re building software to run it and\nsoftware to innovate it \u2014 so you\u2019re really in the software business now.\nWhether you\u2019re an online retailer or an airline or a bank, every company is a\ntech company. And all tech companies are facing the same problem: software\ndevelopment is getting more and more complex.\n\nWhy has it become so complex?\n\nYesterday, it was the proliferation of microservices, the explosion of cloud\ntooling, and the rise of DevOps \u2014 where you\u2019re responsible for everything you\nbuild, from how a service is deployed to how secure it is, to how much it\ncosts to run. Today, it\u2019s generative A.I. and code generation tools that give\nteams the power to build faster than ever, while also increasing software\nsprawl at a previously unimaginable rate. And tomorrow? There will be a new\ntechnology, just as exciting and transformative as microservice, clouds, and\nLLMs, and just as likely to spur on more sprawl.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t even have to be something as sophisticated or world-changing as\nA.I. It could simply be that your parent company acquired another company, and\nso your engineering org just doubled in size and inherited an entirely\nseparate tech stack. Suddenly, you have to make sense of a thousand new\ncomponents built in a hundred new ways by a hundred new engineers \u2014 increasing\nthe cognitive load of all your teams and testing the limits of context-\nswitching and their patience.\n\nSo what\u2019s the solution? This is where Backstage comes in...\n\n## Taming the chaos and empowering teams with a Backstage IDP\n\nBackstage began life at Spotify as a software catalog \u2014 a directory of all the\ncomponents our teams were building, from backend services to websites and\nlibraries, emphasizing ownership and discoverability. And then we just kept\nadding to it. Because the platform had a simple, extensible plugin\narchitecture, Backstage could evolve to tame chaos and complexity wherever it\nfound it \u2014 until eventually it became a hub for everything engineering: aka,\nan internal developer portal (or IDP).\n\nAs a single pane of glass for all your tech infrastructure, a Backstage IDP\nstreamlines software development \u2014 promoting the healthy parts of teams\nbuilding software (ownership, tech standards, knowledge sharing, self-service,\nand collaboration), while minimizing the frustrating parts (silos,\nfragmentation, lack of discovery and documentation, dependency bottlenecks,\nand unclear standards).\n\nProductivity metrics for Spotify\u2019s frequent Backstage users.\n\nAt Spotify, we saw how much Backstage could improve developer effectiveness\nfirsthand. Not only did Spotify\u2019s frequent Backstage users build faster, but\nthey also created higher-quality software compared to other developers.\nAccording to that internal study, our Backstage users are 2.3x more active in\nGitHub, create 2x as many code changes in 17% less cycle time, and deploy\nsoftware 2x as often \u2014 and their software is deployed for 3x as long. We were\nonto something.\n\n## An open platform that prioritizes developer experience\n\nSince open sourcing the Backstage framework and donating it to the CNCF, the\nwider tech community has experienced the benefits of improved developer\nexperience and productivity for themselves. As part of last month\u2019s KubeCon in\nParis, the CNCF held its third BackstageCon \u2014 a testament to the platform\u2019s\ncontinued growth and popularity. The open source framework has over 2,200\nproject contributors and over 3,000 adopting companies. Based on that, we\nestimate over two million people are using our homegrown developer portal\ntoday.\n\nAn open platform solving for developer experience.\n\nThe third-party Backstage ecosystem is thriving as well. Consulting companies\nlike Frontside, Thoughtworks, and Adaptavist provide a range of services and\nsupport for Backstage adopters. Popular tech services continue to build\nplugins for Backstage, including new ones coming soon from Rootly, DX,\nLinearB, Snyk, and Swimm. And new companies are adopting Backstage every week.\n\nBut we want to see this ecosystem grow even further. And we think Spotify has\na lot more to offer Backstage adopters of all shapes and sizes.\n\n## DevEx at scale: Spotify\u2019s secret sauce\n\nDeveloper experience has long been a main ingredient of Spotify\u2019s success. And\nthat has put us in a unique position to become a pioneer in the field of\nDevOps and platform engineering. Very few companies get to test what they\nbuild in a real-world environment like ours, at the global scale we operate\nin.\n\nWe build developer tools based on the insights we gain from:\n\n  * Our internal R&D community of demanding Spotifiers. We have hundreds of teams who depend on this software every day to get their jobs done, whether they\u2019re shipping innovative features like AI DJ or fighting hordes of spam bots.\n\n  * A diverse open source community of contributors and end users. Spotify\u2019s engineers maintain the open source framework together with a global community of thousands of contributors, while also supporting a Discord channel with over 13,000 members.\n\n  * Our enterprise customers and third-party partners. Other companies have been using our bundle of Spotify-built plugins and support services. So, we learn by seeing our tools and methods being applied to companies that can sometimes be very different from our own.\n\nAll of this feedback, experience, and understanding goes into what we ship. We\nthink this unique perspective adds unique value to the Backstage ecosystem,\nsomething no one else can offer. And that\u2019s what you\u2019ll see in the products we\nannounced today.\n\n## Say hello to Spotify for Backstage\n\nDifferent companies need different kinds of IDPs. There are the DIY companies\nwho need to build a highly customized IDP from the ground up, those who need\nan IDP that\u2019s quick to set up and easy to maintain right out of the box, and\nmany others who fall somewhere in between.\n\nOur products for Backstage are designed to supercharge your developer\nexperience, no matter what kind of business you\u2019re in, how big or small your\ncompany is, or where you are in your DevEx journey.\n\nOur new product lineup addresses the range of adopter needs.\n\nIn the webinar, you\u2019ll hear Spotify\u2019s Backstage team talk about:\n\n  * Spotify Plugins for Backstage: Level up your custom portal with our newly updated bundle of proven, Spotify-built plugins, including Soundcheck, Role-Based Access Control, Skill Exchange, and Insights.\n\n  * Spotify Enterprise Support for Backstage: Let our Backstage experts help you build, maintain, or customize your portal with our personalized support and consulting services.\n\n  * Spotify Portal for Backstage: Get a full-featured IDP designed by Spotify, that\u2019s both fast to get up and running, and easy to maintain.
