They were given tasks, rewards, and objectives \u2014 the kind of thing\nthat would be prime-time reality TV these days. Before long, the two camps had\nestablished tribal identities. They had their own culture, norms, and\nbehavioral standards. They were The Eagles and The Rattlers. And, other than a\nfew insults and scowls, the two camps lived in peace.\n\nBut after five days, Sherif upped the game. He had the two groups compete for\nfood. He limited their resources. It was a fist-swinging, curse-hurling, dust\ncloud of a mess. When a few punches landed, the adult researchers had to step\nin, adults with notebooks holding back furious Eagles and violent Rattlers.\n\nSherif concluded that scarcity was one of the main drivers of all human\nconflict. War, violence, invasion, and theft were all born of wanting a\nlimited resource. The history of all humanity seems to support the hypothesis:\nWe fight over water, cattle, arable land, ore deposits, oil, precious stones,\nand so on.\n\nBig Think recently spoke with Oxford University philosopher Nick Bostrom about\nhis new book, Deep Utopia. He\u2019s got good news. Bostrom argues that the future\nwill do away with the need for conflict over scarce resources. To him, the\nfuture is plentiful.\n\n## An age of abundance\n\nSo much of nature is based on resource scarcity. All species are locked in an\nevolutionary struggle to eat to survive and survive to pass on genes. And so,\na lot of human behavior and the intuitions we\u2019ve built around it stem from the\nneed to compete. So, what happens when you take away the source of that\ncompetition? Human compassion and magnanimity may kick in.\n\n\u201cIt generally becomes easier to be generous if you\u2019re doing well and you have\na big windfall, [because] when there isn\u2019t enough for everybody, it\u2019s just a\nquestion of who is going to starve, and then everything becomes much tougher,\u201d\nBostrom told Big Think.\n\nIf the AI revolution really does succeed, Bostrom argues it would do away with\nmuch of the drudgery of everyday life. It would provide \u201can enormously big\npie\u201d to share. In his book, Bostrom calls this a \u201cpost-scarcity utopia,\u201d where\n\u201cthe right economic policies would inaugurate an age of abundance.\u201d\n\nFor Bostrom, this is not just \u201cworld peace and harmony.\u201d It will transform the\neveryday humdrum reality of everyday people. We can spend more of our lives\nsimply having fun or doing things we find meaningful. That\u2019s largely because\ntime is the ultimate resource. A human life is measured by how much time it\nhas to offer and on what. AI, automation, and technology could soon allow us\nto devote more time to the things that make us happy \u2014 what Bostrom calls\n\u201cpleasure, in the sense of the authentic article. [A pleasure that] genuinely\nfeels good and fills our spirit with a warm affirming joy; and, whatever we\nmay tell ourselves, some core part of us cannot help but really like it.\u201d\n\n## The grind of everyday life\n\nOf course, as the ancients knew, there is a difference between pleasure\n(hedonia) and the deep, purposeful happiness of human flourishing\n(eudaimonia). In this post-scarcity utopia, what room is there for overcoming,\nfortitude, resilience, and growth?\n\nAldous Huxley\u2019s Brave New World presented the archetypal example of a\n\u201cdystopia full of pleasure.\u201d In the final chapters, the \u201csavage\u201d meets one of\nthe leaders of this always-pleasant, never-painful world and says, \u201cI don\u2019t\nwant comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom,\nand I want goodness. I want sin.\u201d The confused leader, Mustafa Mond, shrugs\nhis shoulders and says, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to them.\u201d\n\nThe entire book is set up for us to view Mond as some kind of alien \u2014 a man\nwho misunderstands humanity and the deeper things in life. Bostrom sympathizes\nwith Mond.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s easy to say, and it\u2019s what we want to hear,\u201d Bostrom said. \u201cIf\nyou\u2019re reading a novel, it makes for a more interesting novel. If you\u2019re\nwatching a theater play or movie, you want those to be full of drama and\nsuffering and overcoming and defying, and all of this stuff. But I think\nthat\u2019s not ultimately the right question. We\u2019re not talking about which future\nwould be best to look at from the outside in but which future would be best to\nlive in. And the answer to that might be quite different. What makes for a\ngood story is war, murder, and tragedies. That\u2019s not necessarily what you\nwould want to spend the rest of eternity in that condition.\u201d\n\nBostrom essentially makes two points against the \u201csuffering is good for us\u201d\nargument. First, most people don\u2019t actually mean that. Intellectually, I can\nappreciate the historical importance of war on human progress, but I don\u2019t\nwant to die in a war zone or have any of my loved ones maimed by a bomb. In\nfact, most people, if push came to shove, would happily live a life free of\n\u201csuffering.\u201d Second, Bostrom is keen to point out that a post-scarcity utopia,\nespecially one driven by AI, is more about removing the day-to-day misery that\noccupies an actual person\u2019s life. As Bostrom put it:\n\n\u201cIf you just zoom in on an average person in a wealthy country \u2014 a middle-\nclass American, or whatever \u2014 and see how much discomfort and pain and\nlimitation and then decay there is, it\u2019s not even some kind of beautiful,\nmelancholy, tragic moments that have greater significance and cause a\nspiritual awakening, but just kind of boring headaches and like feeling kind\nof dissatisfied because, you know, you have some medical condition or are\nbored at the eight hours you have to spend at work every day \u2014 the kind of\ngrind of everyday life.\u201d\n\nThis kind of misery is not theatrical, and it\u2019s not Shakespearean. It\u2019s bloody\nannoying, and most people would be happier without it.\n\n## Wired for pain\n\nThe Matrix imagines the world as an undetectable simulation. We are wired into\na virtual reality that we think is real, but is actually the sensory\nstimulation of future robots using our bodies as batteries. In The Matrix, the\nrobot-representative Agent Smith says, \u201cDid you know that the first Matrix was\ndesigned to be a perfect human world? Where none suffered, where everyone\nwould be happy. It was a disaster. No one would accept the program... I\nbelieve that, as a species, human beings define their reality through\nsuffering and misery. The perfect world was a dream that your primitive\ncerebrum kept trying to wake up from.\u201d\n\nAgent Smith\u2019s point is that since our evolution has been full of misery,\nscarcity, conflict, and setbacks, everything about our physiology and\nneurology is wired for pain. So, how does Bostrom approach this problem? Is\nthe human mind ready for utopia?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should take our instructions from what has been selected for\nevolutionarily,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think there\u2019s a lot of room for improvement\nin terms of our human biological nature, which we seem quite willing to grasp\nwhenever we get the chance. We think our immune systems are not good enough,\nso we try to develop vaccines. Our vision is not good enough, especially as we\nget into middle age, so we have glasses or contact lenses. I mean, it\u2019s kind\nof quite ingrained in human nature itself to want to modify yourself, develop,\ngrow, or change.\u201d\n\nSubscribe for counterintuitive, surprising, and impactful stories delivered to\nyour inbox every Thursday\n\nMore than a penchant for suffering, and more than a need to challenge\nourselves, humans are a species that can adapt. In times of flux and epochal\nchange, there\u2019s often a peculiar strain of natural law among nervous,\nconservative minds \u2014 the \u201cnatural\u201d way of man is right, so don\u2019t meddle with\nit. This strain was there when we developed immunization, organ transplants,\ncontraception, and anesthetics. It\u2019s there now with AI.\n\nBostrom put it well: \u201cPast performance is no guarantee of future performance.\nOut of all the possible modes of being and all the different people with\ndifferent values we could become, it would be really surprising if \u2018remaining\nexactly the way we are now\u2019 would be the best possibility for how we should\nspend the next million years.\u201d\n\nThe past made us who we are today, and the future will make us into something\nnew. And, if Bostrom is right, it\u2019ll make us happier.\n\nTags\n\nphilosophy\n\nIn this article\n\nphilosophy\n\nRelated\n\nThinking\n\nReality is your brain\u2019s best guess\n\nYour expectations form the way you experience the world.\n\nThe Future\n\nLongtermism: The future is vast \u2013 what does this mean for our own life?\n\nIf we manage to avoid a large catastrophe, we are living at the early\nbeginnings of human history.\n\nThinking\n\nWhy don\u2019t robots have rights?\n\nIn the future, people may look back with horror at how humans treated AI in\nthe 21st century.\n\nThe Well\n\nWhy a meaningful life is impossible without suffering\n\nPain makes sense from an evolutionary perspective.
