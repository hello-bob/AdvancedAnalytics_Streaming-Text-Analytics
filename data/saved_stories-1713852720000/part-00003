These included an\namendment that would have required federal agencies to show probable cause and\nobtain a warrant from America's secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\nbefore accessing the private communications of US persons caught up in\nsurveillance queries.\n\nUnder the status quo, the Feds would run queries on US persons' comms data\nbefore obtaining an intelligence court warrant, later arguing the searches\nwere needed before it was possible to \u201cestablish probable cause or\ndemonstrate\u201d urgency.\n\nThe Senate also rejected an amendment that sought to curb an expanded\ndefinition of an electronic communications service provider, which previously\ncovered traditional phone, email, and internet companies.\n\nUnder RISAA, as passed, however, now \"any other service provider who has\naccess to equipment that is being or may be used to transmit or store wire or\nelectronic communications\" may be required to hand these communications over\nto the Feds for their intelligence searches and analysis, as well as\n\"custodians\" of these so-called service providers.\n\nAfter the US House of Representatives approved the Section 702 reauthorization\non April 12, US Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) warned RISAA \"will force a huge range\nof companies and individuals to spy for the government.\"\n\nOn Saturday, after voting no on the bill, Wyden blasted his fellow senators\nfor waiting \"until the 11th hour to ram through renewal of warrantless\nsurveillance in the dead of night.\"\n\n\"Time after time anti-reformers pledge that their band-aid changes to the law\nwill curb abuses, and yet every time, the public learns about fresh abuses by\nofficials who face little meaningful oversight,\" Wyden said in a statement.\n\"Those of us who believe liberty and security are not mutually exclusive have\na lot of work to do.\"\n\n  * Hugely expanded Section 702 surveillance powers set for US Senate vote\n  * US House approves FISA renewal \u2013 warrantless surveillance and all\n  * Just declassified: US senator caught up in Section 702 FBI surveillance dragnet\n  * House passes bill banning Uncle Sam from snooping on citizens via data brokers\n\nFISA Section 702 allows the FBI, CIA, NSA and the National Counterterrorism\nCenter (NCTC) to collect up and snoop on phone calls, text messages, and\nemails involving select foreigners residing outside America, with the intent\nbeing to prevent these intelligence targets from committing terrorist acts or\nother serious crimes.\n\nHowever, if the communications involve so-called \"US persons\" \u2014 mainly, but\nnot solely, American citizens, permanent residents, and corporate entities \u2014\nthen these messages are also scooped up for the Feds to pore over without\nfirst obtaining a warrant.\n\nThis warrantless surveillance of Americans has been abused by the FBI to snoop\non protesters, political campaign donors, and even a US senator.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the FBI and Biden administration have said these civil\nliberties and privacy concerns are unfounded. Earlier this year FBI boss\nChristopher Wray told lawmakers that \"702 is the greatest tool the FBI has to\ncombat [Chinese] hacking groups,\" and the bureau's top brass has called it\n\"absolutely critical for the FBI to continue protecting the American people.\"\n\nOn Saturday, following the Senate's vote to reauthorize Section 702, US\nAttorney General Merrick Garland described it as \"indispensable to the Justice\nDepartment's work to protect the American people from terrorist, nation-state,\ncyber, and other threats.\"\n\nMeanwhile, digital privacy and civil liberties advocates vowed to continue\npushing for surveillance reforms.\n\n\"It is profoundly disappointing that Congress passed a bill that gives the\ngovernment more ways to secretly surveil us \u2014 with little power to hold spy\nagencies accountable,\" said Kia Hamadanchy, senior policy counsel at the\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union.\n\n\"Senators were aware of the threat this surveillance bill posed to our civil\nliberties and pushed it through anyway, promising they would attempt to\naddress some of the most heinous expansions in the near future,\" Hamadanchy\nadded. \"We plan to make sure these promises are kept.\" \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act\n  * Joe Biden\n  * Ron Wyden\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act\n  * Joe Biden\n  * Ron Wyden\n  * Surveillance\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * NSO Group\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Security\n  * United States of America\n\n#### More about\n\n1 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act\n  * Joe Biden\n  * Ron Wyden\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act\n  * Joe Biden\n  * Ron Wyden\n  * Surveillance\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * NSO Group\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Security\n  * United States of America\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Hugely expanded Section 702 surveillance powers set for US Senate vote\n\nOpponents warn almost anyone could be asked to share info with Uncle Sam\n\nPublic Sector5 days | 18\n\n#### Reform of USA's Section 702 spying rule may make it to a vote this week\n\nTool that lets spooks observe Americans appears to have been renewed for\nanother year\n\nPublic Sector14 days | 12\n\n#### House passes bill banning Uncle Sam from snooping on citizens via data\nbrokers\n\nVote met strong opposition from Biden's office\n\nSecurity4 days | 21\n\n#### Protecting distributed branch office environments from ransomware\n\nAs ransomware becomes more sophisticated, detection tools should be upgraded\nto cover every site and location\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### US House approves FISA renewal \u2013 warrantless surveillance and all\n\nInfosec in brief PLUS: Chinese chipmaker Nexperia attacked; A Microsoft-signed\nbackdoor; CISA starts scanning your malware; and more\n\nSecurity8 days | 11\n\n#### Taiwanese film studio snaps up Chinese surveillance camera specialist\nDahua\n\nStymied by sanctions, it had to go ... but where?\n\nSecurity5 days |\n\n#### Samsung snags $6.4B in CHIPS Act funds for Texas fabs\n\nWork in Austin, Taylor will include new 2nm facility, packaging plant, and\nPentagon partnership\n\nSystems7 days | 4\n\n#### US 'considering' end to Assange prosecution bid\n\nCryptic Biden hint came ahead of April 16 deadline for next step in\nextradition case\n\nLegal12 days | 88\n\n#### Polish officials may face criminal charges in Pegasus spyware probe\n\nVictims of the powerful surveillance tool will soon find out the truth\n\nSecurity20 days | 13\n\n#### Stalkerware usage surging, despite data privacy concerns\n\nAt least 31,031 people affected last year\n\nSecurity1 month | 1\n\n#### White House goes to court, not Congress, to renew warrantless spy powers\n\nChoose your own FISA Section 702 adventure: End-run around lawmakers or\nbusiness as usual?\n\nPublic Sector2 months | 14\n\n#### Biden's State of the Union included a battle cry against AI mimicry\n\nLots of pats on the back for the CHIPS Act too\n\nAI + ML1 month | 16\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
