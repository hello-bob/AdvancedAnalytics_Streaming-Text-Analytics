The companies are to\nbuild, launch, and deploy the network of satellites, intended as Europe's\nanswer to SpaceX's Starlink satellite Internet service for connectivity and\nsecure communications, by 2027.\n\nHowever, the European Commission recently delayed the awarding of a contract\nto this consortium from March to an undetermined date. In April, Europe's\nCommissioner for Internal Market, Thierry Breton, said, \u201cThere is an\nindependent committee which is working on the evaluation process. The work is\nbeing carried out extremely seriously.\" He did not say when this work would\nconclude.\n\n## Don\u2019t be hasty\n\nA new report in a German publication, Handelsblatt, provides information on\nsome likely causes of the delay. The report indicates that the cost estimate\nfor the Interconnectivity and Security by Satellite (IRIS2) constellation has\ndoubled from an initial estimate of 6 billion euros to 12 billion.\nAdditionally, the project is exposing long-running fault lines between Germany\nand France when it comes to European space policy.\n\nThe report cites a letter written by Germany's Federal Minister for Economic\nAffairs and Climate Action, Robert Habeck, to Thierry Breton in March. In his\nletter, Habeck urged Breton not to make \"hasty decisions\" about the project\nand said planning should be reset.\n\nHabeck did not question the need for a sovereign communications network. The\nwar in Ukraine has left a deep impression on Europeans, and they have seen the\nvalue of secure satellite Internet. The difficulty is in how to get there. The\ncontinent does not have a reusable rocket like SpaceX's Falcon 9, nor the\ncapacity to rapidly build hundreds of complex satellites.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe European Commission and European Space Agency are jointly investing in the\nproject to develop these capabilities. However, the IRIS2 constellation is\nintended to be a public-private partnership, with the space companies also\ninvesting in the project and subsequently profiting from selling communication\nservices.\n\nThe problem is that the major players involved, such as Airbus and\nArianespace, are not accustomed to operating in space projects in this way.\nTypically, they are given government contracts to provide services rather than\ninvesting significant amounts of their own capital.\n\nThe letter from Habeck is a signal that Germany, which alongside France is\nlikely to be the main financial backer of IRIS2, is not happy that most of the\nprime contractors are based in France or linked to the nation. In addition,\nBreton is French. And finally, it appears the operations for the constellation\nwill be based primarily in Italy.\n\n## It probably won\u2019t be hasty\n\nCompetition between France and Germany in spaceflight, despite both nations\nbeing prominent members of the European Union, has been long-running. One\nexample is the Ariane 6 rocket, the continent's new launch vehicle. Its design\ngrew out of a compromise that saw France responsible for the rocket's first\nstage and Germany primarily responsible for the upper stage.\n\nIn recent years, both nations have sought to foster an environment in which\nnew space companies can develop and flourish. Another source of tension in the\ndevelopment of the IRIS2 constellation is that up to one-third of the contract\nvalue was supposed to go to smaller space companies rather than the prime\ncontractors. However, this looks increasingly unlikely to happen.\n\nIt should really come as no surprise that Europe is seeing delays with the\nIRIS2 constellation and probable cost overruns. Internet constellations are\nhard, and Europe has several hurdles to overcome. There is the Ariane 6\nrocket, which is four years late and already has a busy manifest and technical\ndifficulty in building such satellites. And there is the challenge of\ncoordinating such a complex endeavor across many different constituencies.\n\nAll of this will likely eventually get sorted out, and European companies are\ncertainly capable of building excellent satellites. But a sovereign European\nsatellite Internet constellation is probably not coming before the end of this\ndecade, nor at a low price.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n45\n\nEric Berger Eric Berger is the senior space editor at Ars Technica, covering\neverything from astronomy to private space to wonky NASA policy, and author of\nthe book Liftoff, about the rise of SpaceX.
