Read More...\n\nA decision by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to\nchange how it maintains the widely used National Vulnerability Database (NVD)\nhas focused attention on the brittle nature of current enterprise\nvulnerability management processes.\n\nOn February 13, NIST announced, seemingly out of the blue, what amounted to a\nscaling back of its vulnerability analysis contributions to the database \u2014 and\nits related plan to hand off that task to a consortium of other organizations.\nAt the time, NIST offered no explanation for its decision. NIST warned those\nusing the NVD to expect \"delays in analysis efforts\" during the transition and\napologized for any resulting inconvenience.\n\nThe announcement jolted industry stakeholders. Since 2005, NIST has played a\nkey role in providing analysis of and context for new vulnerabilities in the\nform of Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) tags, Common Platform Enumerators\n(CPEs), and the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). CWEs associate a\nvulnerability with the underlying software- or architecture-level weakness\nthat caused it. It provides a standard taxonomy for classifying software\nweaknesses. CPEs identify specific software, systems, and versions that a\nvulnerability might affect so users know what they need to address and\nremediate. CVSS scores provide a measure of a vulnerability's severity on\nsystem confidentiality, integrity, and availability and help security teams\nprioritize remediation efforts.\n\nNIST's abrupt slowdown resulted in a fast-growing list of vulnerabilities\n(CVEs) in the NVD without the crucial CWE, CPE, and other metadata security\nteams and tools have long relied on. The NVD dashboard shows that, as of April\n18, NIST had analyzed just 99 of the 2,098 new vulnerabilities in the NVD\nsince the beginning of April. In March, NIST provided CWE, CPE, and associated\ndata for only 199 of 3,370 CVEs that the NVD received \u2014 or less than 6% of the\ntotal.\n\nThis lack of analysis for vulnerabilities has caused considerable concern over\npotential disruptions to long-established vulnerability management workflows\nat enterprise organizations. There's worry about security teams being able to\nproperly determine vulnerability risks and prioritize remediation efforts.\nSome are even calling it a death knell for the NVD.\n\nHere's what the NVD slowdown means in practical terms for vulnerability\nmanagement \u2014 and why you should change your approach and go beyond\nvulnerabilities to focus on malware and tampering.\n\n[ Special Report: The State of Software Supply Chain Security (SSCS) 2024 | Download Report: State of SSCS ]\n\n## A significant challenge for enterprise security\n\nCallie Guenther, senior manager of cyberthreat research at Critical Start,\nsaid the recent cessation of analytical data additions to the NVD poses\nsignificant challenges for enterprise security teams and vendors.\n\n> \"Enterprises might face operational challenges, as automated tools relying\n> on NVD data become less effective, necessitating alternative data sources or\n> manual processes.\" \u2014Callie Guenther\n\nGuenther noted that compliance with regulatory standards that mandate\ncomprehensive NVD vulnerability data usage may also become more challenging.\n\n## Why did NIST slow down the NVD?\n\nJason Soroko, senior vice president of product at Sectigo, said NIST's\ndecision likely had to do with its analysts being overwhelmed.\n\n> \"The problem is scale. NIST is going to open up the program to a consortium\n> of vetted organizations from the industry in order to deal with the backlog\n> of vulnerabilities that need to be analyzed and understood before being put\n> into the NVD database.\" \u2014Jason Soroko\n\nNIST itself updated its original cryptic notice to say that the reason it was\nworking on assembling a consortium was because of a \"growing backlog of\nvulnerabilities in NVD.\"\n\n> \"This is based on a variety of factors, including an increase in software\n> and, therefore, vulnerabilities, as well as a change in interagency\n> support.\" \u2014NIST\n\nThe standards body said that it is currently focusing on providing analysis\naround the most significant vulnerabilities and on finding more analysts to\ncontribute to the effort. \"We are also looking into longer-term solutions to\nthis challenge, including the establishment of a consortium of industry,\ngovernment, and other stakeholder organizations that can collaborate on\nresearch to improve the NVD,\" NIST said.\n\nGo beyond vulnerability management and remediation\n\nJosh Bressers, vice president of security at Anchore, said the disruption that\nthe NVD slowdown has caused is instructional.\n\n> \"The biggest takeaway is how fragile the vulnerability ecosystems are.\"\n> \u2014Josh Bressers\n\nThere has been growth of more than 20% in the number of vulnerabilities\nassigned in the NVD each year, and vulnerability teams are not able to keep\npace, Bressers noted. Between 2022 and 2023 alone, the number of\nvulnerabilities (CVEs) in NVD shot up from 25,081 to 28,831, Intel471 has\ntracked.\n\n\"Vulnerability teams are struggling to keep up with this load. I'm hopeful the\nNVD activity will be used as an opportunity to rethink how we deal with this\ndata and how we can improve our processes.\" \u2014Josh Bressers\n\nBressers said organizations that are required to comply with the federal\ngovernment's FedRAMP program will likely feel the biggest short-term impact\nfrom the NVD slowdown. That's because FedRAMP requires such organizations to\nuse only NVD data when remediating vulnerabilities. \"By definition, only NVD\ncan supply an NVD severity rating,\" he noted.\n\nBut the challenges don't end there, Bressers said. Many organizations and\nvendors have relied on NVD data because of how comprehensive it has been. With\nNIST pulling back from the effort, a gap has opened that cannot be easily\nfilled, he said.\n\n## Can an open-source model for the NVD help?\n\nAnchore launched an open-source repository, called NVD Data Overrides, that it\nhopes will fill that gap. \"This repo is meant to provide additional data that\nis currently missing from NVD,\" the project's page on GitHub noted.\n\nThe project is open to all on GitHub, Bressers said, who added that the effort\nis still in its very early stages. \"Anyone is free to use the data we are\ngenerating with no restrictions. Long term, we hope to see more open-source\nmethods applied to vulnerability data.\"\n\nCritical Start's Guenther said organizations may need to consider alternative,\nthird-party databases, collaborate on open-source projects such as Anchore's,\nor enhance internal risk assessments for the context they need for CVEs and\nhow to remediate them.\n\n## Is the NVD an outdated approach?\n\nOrganizations may also want to look beyond purely reactive measures such as\nvulnerability mitigation and consider more proactive approaches such as threat\nhunting and penetration testing, Guenther said.\n\n\"This situation underscores the importance of adaptability and collaboration\nin the cybersecurity community, highlighting the need for potential long-term\nshifts in how vulnerability information is managed and distributed.\" \u2014Callie\nGuenther\n\nRegardless of the NVD slowdown, teams are faced with more alerts than they can\nhandle. SecurityScorecard and the Cyentia Institute estimate that\norganizations fix only 10% of the vulnerabilities in their software each\nmonth. That's not a good outcome for software security \u2014 nor for overworked\napplication security and security operations teams.\n\nThe most-used tool for assessing software risk is the CVSS, which offers a\nscore to assess the risks that specific vulnerabilities pose to an\norganization. However, a number of criticisms have been leveled at the system,\nincluding that it is complex and difficult to understand, not accurate, and\nwidely misunderstood.\n\nThe new Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) aims to add more value to\nsoftware risk scoring, combining descriptive information about vulnerabilities\nwith evidence of actual exploitation in the wild.\n\nJeremy Long, a principal engineer at ServiceNow and founder and project lead\nof the OWASP Dependency Check Program, said at Black Hat last year that if\norganizations want to properly defend against today's software supply chain\nattacks, they will have to adopt tooling and measures that detect and mitigate\nmalicious threats.\n\nHe recommended modern tooling that uses binary validation, which can detect\nthreats such as malicious build-time dependencies. This type of protocol can\nprovide a comparison of build versions, showcasing anomalies that traditional\ntesting misses and that further analysis may deem malicious, Long said.\n\n## Modern threats require modern tools\n\nWhile the NVD is still useful, it's not equal to the challenge of managing the\nrisk from the rise of software supply chain attacks. Rather than focusing on\nremediation of vulnerabilities, to manage modern risk teams need to shift\ntheir focus to active malware \u2014 and modern attack techniques such as software\ntampering.\n\nA recent ReversingLabs report, \"Flying Blind: Firms Struggle to Detect\nSoftware Supply Chain Attacks,\" found that software organizations need to be\nable to detect tampering at any and all stages of development, including post-\nbuild and post-deployment. The report, based on a survey by Dimensional\nResearch, noted that while scans for tampering were fairly common during the\nbuild process (53%) and after build but prior to deployment (43%), much lower\npercentages of survey respondents said they scanned code post-deployment (34%)\nor that they scanned individual components prior to build (33%).\n\nComplex binary analysis provides the much-needed final exam for complete\nsoftware packages. Charlie Jones, director of product management at\nReversingLabs, wrote recently in an OpenSSF blog post:\n\n\"Incidents like the 3CX hack are proof that 'business as usual' in the\napplication security testing space is not sufficient. If organizations want to\nkeep pace with an evolving threat landscape, a new approach to risk management\nis needed that supports modern software supply chain needs. Binary analysis\nhelps fill this gap by providing organizations with a method for analyzing\ndifferent software types in a consistent and repeatable manner.\" \u2014Charlie\nJones\n\nGet up to speed on key trends and learn expert insights with The State of\nSoftware Supply Chain Security 2024.
