We must reverse this decision before it\nis too late.\n\nThere are so many misstatements and flawed analyses in the 110-page notice of\nApril 19, 2024, in the Federal Register that it is hard to know where to\nbegin. But here are some key extracts:\n\narticle continues after advertisement\n\n\u201cDOE believes at this time that circadian-friendly integrated LED lamps do not\npossess unique attributes compared to other (GSLs).\u201d (i.e. light bulbs, which\nthey refer to as general service lamps). (p. 28877)\n\nThis is nonsense. Circadian-friendly light bulbs have distinct spectral power\ndistributions\u2014i.e., the relative amounts of light at each color wavelength.\nCircadian-friendly lights are rich in 480 nm blue during the day and emit\nminimal 480 nm blue in the evenings and at night. This can easily be measured\nwith a handheld spectrophotometer.\n\nEvidence establishes that circadian-friendly lights should be less than 2\npercent 440-495 nm blue in the evening and at night, and more than 20 percent\n440-495 nm blue during the daytime.\n\n\u201cThere is no consensus on specific lamp attributes that meaningfully impact\nthe human circadian cycle.\u201d (p. 28877)\n\nThis statement ignores the literature of more than 10,000 peer-reviewed\nscientific papers since 2000 on the interaction of circadian clocks and light.\nIt also fails to acknowledge multiple consensus reports and studies, such as\nthe recent consensus study of 248 leading scientists who have published over\n2,500 papers on circadian rhythms and light who concluded:\n\n  * The sensitivity peak of the ipRGC melanopic receptors in the human retina is approximately 480nm in the blue part of the visible spectrum.\n  * The most potent wavelengths for circadian entrainment are 460-495 nm blue light near to the sensitivity peak of the ipRGC melanopic receptors.\n  * Blue-enriched (460-495nm) light in the evening (during the three hours before bedtime) disrupts nocturnal sleep more than blue-depleted light at the same intensity.\n  * Blue-enriched (460-495nm) light in the evening (during the three hours before bedtime) phase delays the circadian system more than blue-depleted light at the same intensity.\n  * Blue-enriched (460-495nm) light in the evening (during the three hours before bedtime) disrupts circadian rhythms more than blue-depleted light at the same intensity.\n  * Exposure to 460-495nm blue light at night suppresses melatonin production.\n  * Exposure to 460-495nm blue light at night disrupts circadian rhythms.\n  * Light used in the evening (during the three hours before bedtime) should have as little blue content as practically possible.\n  * Increasing the energy efficiency of lights is desirable, but not if it increases the risks of causing circadian disruption and serious illness.\n  * LED lights with high 460-495nm blue content should carry the warning label: \u201cmay be harmful if used at night.\u201d\n\narticle continues after advertisement\n\nIn conclusion, light bulbs with high blue content have quite distinct and\ndifferent attributes as compared with those that have low blue content.\n\n\u201cThe adopted standards, which are expressed in minimum lumens (\u201clm\u201d) output\nper watt (\u201cW\u201d) of a lamp or lamp efficacy (\u201clm/W\u201d), ... These standards apply\nto all products .. manufactured in, or imported into, the United States\nstarting on July 25, 2028.\u201d (p. 28857)\n\nDOE mistakenly regards lumens as the only value delivered by light bulbs and\ntherefore focuses on maximizing lumens per watt (or minimizing the power\nnecessary to create those lumens).\n\nBut lumens primarily measure the green and yellow wavelengths, which are\nassociated with visual brightness. They do not measure the blue wavelengths\ncritical for managing circadian health or the red wavelengths essential for\nhealing.\n\nTHE BASICS\n\n  * What Is Circadian Rhythm?\n  * Find a sleep therapist near me\n\nThus, electrical energy used to provide healthy light wavelengths is wasted\nenergy, according to the DOE. As a consequence, healthy light bulbs are ranked\nlower when lumens per watt are used as the regulatory standard. This makes it\nextremely difficult, if not impossible, for healthy light bulbs to meet these\narbitrary very high lumens/watt standards.\n\narticle continues after advertisement\n\n\"DOE is not exempting circadian-friendly integrated LED lamps from the GSL\ndefinition in this final rule and as a result, these lamps will be subject to\nthe standards for GSLs.\u201d (p. 28877)\n\nWhen the spectral distribution of light wavelengths has to be focused on\nreaching high lumens per watt targets, a large advantage is given to blue-pump\nLEDs. Not exempting circadian-friendly light bulbs from this new regulation,\nrisks banning the use of low and zero-blue circadian-friendly light bulbs in\nthe evening.\n\nCircadian Rhythm Essential Reads\n\nWhy Are Cancer Rates in Young People Climbing?\n\nThe Fifth Generation of Light Has Arrived\n\nDOE is currently only monetizing health benefits from changes in ambient fine\nparticulate matter (\u201cPM 2.5\u201d) concentrations from two precursors (SO 2 and NO\nX), and from changes in ambient ozone from one precursor (for NO X ) (p.\n28859-60)\n\nThe DOE is tipping the scales to justify its draconian policy of banning\nhealthy lights by taking into account only the benefits of reducing greenhouse\ngases. They fail to consider the health costs of using blue-rich LED light\nbulbs at night, which include sleep disorders, psychiatric disorders, obesity,\ndiabetes, heart disease, breast cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer,\nand much more.\n\nOnly blue-pump LEDs will be allowed after 2028\n\nCircadian Light Research Center\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nAs the DOE acknowledged:\n\n\u201cIn the January 2023 provisional rules, DOE proposed a definition for\n'circadian-friendly integrated LED lamps' and proposed that lamps meeting that\ndefinition be excluded from the GSL definition. DOE identified commercially\navailable integrated LED lamps that are marketed as aiding in the human sleep-\nwake ( i.e., circadian) cycle by changing the light spectrum and also observed\nthat their efficacies ranged from 47.8 lm/W to 85.7 lm/W.\u201d\n\narticle continues after advertisement\n\nHowever, the lighting industry and climate lobbies urged the DOE to cancel the\nproposed exemption, arguing that it was a loophole that lighting manufacturers\nmight use to circumvent the regulatory standard.\n\nUnfortunately, the DOE ignored the evidence provided by me and others about\nhow essential it is to protect the health advantages of using spectral-\nengineered, circadian-friendly light to protect our health.\n\nTo save the health of all users of light, this harmful and ill-formed decision\nby the DOE must be reversed before circadian-friendly light bulbs disappear\nfrom store shelves in 2028.\n\nReferences\n\nUS Department of Energy (2024) Energy Conservation Program: Energy\nConservation Standards for General Service Lamps: Final Rule, Federal Register\n/ Vol. 89, No. 77 / Friday, April 19, 2024 / Rules and Regulations pages\n28856-28965)\n\nMoore-Ede M.
