However, it should generalize\nto anyone on whom you spend similar amounts of time. Also, it\u2019s written from\nthe perspective of computer science; certain aspects may not apply to other\ndisciplines (I\u2019ll let you find the embedded assumptions).\n\n### 2 Symptoms\n\nYou\u2019re a PhD advisor trying to teach your student to write. You spend hours\nmarking up their drafts. (Perhaps like this well-intended professor who really\ncares for their students.) Hours! And yet your student barely seems to get any\nbetter. Perhaps this student really can\u2019t write?\n\nThe student has the dual perspective. They spend days writing a draft and send\nit to you. It comes back \u201cmore red then black\u201d. They aren\u2019t sure where to\nstart, how to proceed, or when to stop. They sense there\u2019s something they\nshould be doing more than superficially correcting every red mark, but what is\nit? They conclude, \u201cperhaps this person really can\u2019t teach writing\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m going to direct this article to the advisor, because they\u2019re the ones who\ncontrol the process, and they\u2019re the ones best placed to fix it.\n\n### 3 Diagnosis\n\nThe problem is this.\n\nWhat you\u2019re trying to do is to train a classifier. You need your student to\nlearn good writing from bad, at least as you define it. You\u2019re providing lots\nof input to that classifier. But your student may actually just be getting\noverwhelmed. You need to\n\n  * Reduce the cognitive load being imposed them.\n\n  * Reduce their sense of being overwhelmed.\n\n  * Use your instincts as a teacher (assuming you have good ones!), not as an author or editor or any other role.\n\n### 4 Proposal\n\nHere\u2019s something that has worked really well for me. My student writes, and we\nco-edit. We do one paragraph or at most two. We go over every sentence, even\nevery word.\n\nFor earlier stage students, I usually say, \u201chere\u2019s the way I would change and\nhere\u2019s why\u201d. I wait for them to digest that, perhaps asking a question to make\nsure they\u2019re building the right model. The critical thing is that we do this\nlive. (This way, they also see that I change and revise and sometimes even\nrevert. I\u2019m not perfect either!)\n\nOnce they have some experience, I flip it around. I point to a sentence or\neven word and say, \u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m going to say about this?\u201d They\nconjecture; I either confirm or correct. And I explain why I have that\nopinion. See, classifier.\n\nHow long does this take? Longer than you might expect! Each sentence can take\nseveral minutes, so one paragraph can take over half an hour. The reason for\nlimiting this to 1\u20132 paragraphs is to bound the time of the whole activity to\n45\u201360 minutes. Beyond that, everyone is exhausted.\n\n### 5 Analysis\n\nI think there are several benefits to this approach. (Yes, it\u2019s a bit like\npair-programming, but I don\u2019t want to stretch that analogy too far because\nit\u2019s not the same thing.)\n\n  * It bounds the amount of time they spend. Instead of spending hours trying to guess my intent, they know that the session will last at most an hour.\n\n  * It bounds the amount of time I spend. I don\u2019t have to spend hours and then feel like I have nothing to show for it.\n\n  * It saves me from doing a bunch of markup with mediocre tools. Nothing is quite as effective as just pointing and editing. We might even learn editing tricks from each other!\n\n  * It\u2019s interactive. The student can ask questions.\n\n  * It models behavior. The student may pick up useful secondary hints from it.\n\nFor instance, I keep a todo list and/or glossary at the top of every file.\nThey can see how I modify that as I\u2019m writing (because they can see me live-\nediting). It\u2019s much easier to learn from a concrete demonstration than from an\nabstract statement to \u201chave a glossary\u201d.\n\nWith modern technology, you have a choice of how to do this. You can do it in\nperson, or you can do it on Zoom. The benefit of doing it on Zoom is that you\ncan have your student record the interaction, so that they can re-watch any\nparts that they were confused about or have forgotten. Or, of course, you can\ncombine the two: do it in-person but record it anyway.\n\nTechnology aside, the most critical impacts are that students are not\noverwhelmed. It\u2019s depressing to send a professor a 10 page paper and get 10\npages of \u201cmore red than black\u201d. The cognitive load is far too high. The brain\nshuts down.\n\nYes, working one paragraph at a time is slow progress. You\u2019re better off doing\nthis a while before a deadline rather than at the very end.\n\nBut consider the following:\n\n  * For a lot of advisors, your current system isn\u2019t quite working for you anyway.\n\n  * If you\u2019re using N hours to comment, I claim you\u2019ll get a two- to ten-fold benefit from doing N one-hour live sessions instead.\n\n  * It\u2019s an S-curve phenomenon. After a while you really see effects blow up (in a good way).\n\nThe key thing for this to succeed is that students have to pick up patterns.\nThat is, if you point to something in this paragraph, the same phenomenon may\noccur three paragraphs later. When you did the single-pass edit through the\nwhole paper, you marked all those instances. The good news is, you gave them\nan opportunity to notice and generalize. The bad news is, you may have left\nthem so overwhelmed that they didn\u2019t notice and didn\u2019t connect and hence never\ngeneralized.\n\nThere\u2019s a large body of literature on learning from examples versus learning\nfrom rules. I won\u2019t go into it here, in part because not a lot of it is in the\ncontext of an advanced learner. Suffices it to say you want to give students\nboth examples and rules. That is, when you make a specific edit, there are\nmany lines that can pass through that point; also give them a more general\nrule that shrinks the number of lines, thereby improving their classifier.\n\n### 6 Finding a Voice\n\nYou\u2019ll note that above I wrote,\n\n> You need your student to learn good writing from bad, at least as you define\n> it.\n\nThat is, what you\u2019re really doing is teaching a student to write in your\nvoice. Voice manifests at many levels, from the overall paper structure to how\none words individual sentences (and may include uses of the passive and active\nvoise).\n\nA voice is something every PhD advisor imparts onto their students. Good or\nbad, they\u2019re implicitly conveying it; I\u2019m just making this explicit. (You may\nnow be thinking of Nipper...)\n\nHowever, this is not necessarily the student\u2019s natural voice! Certainly, my\nPhD advisor and I have extremely different voices. So what to do about this?\n\nI say: it\u2019s okay. Early on, I want students to cultivate something similar to\nmy voice. The focus should be not on individualism but on first getting good\nhabits under the belt. After all, we\u2019re writing papers together, and I may\nhave a better sense of what voice will get papers accepted and read. As a\nstudent matures, their own voice starts to come out\u2014indeed, that is one of the\nsigns of maturity. By the time they graduate, they\u2019re hopefully comfortable\nwriting papers largely by themselves, and these will naturally gravitate\ntowards their preferred voice. But until they get there, having at least one\nsuccessful style under their belt will stand them in good stead.\n\n### 7 Conclusion\n\nIf you try this out, let me know how it goes! I\u2019d love suggestions on how to\nimprove this, including feedback on why it doesn\u2019t work at all.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
