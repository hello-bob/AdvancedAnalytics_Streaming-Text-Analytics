According to Google\nTrends, Facebook's announcement of rebranding to Meta on October 21, 2021, was\nthe catalyst for the upward trend in Metaverse. Four short months later, we\nhit peak Metaverse.\n\nMetaverse Google Trend last 5 years\n\nLike many of us, I, too, was captivated by the allure of the Metaverse,\nbelieving it to be the next big thing. We were all caught up in the NFT mania,\na collective frenzy that further stoked the fires of the Metaverse hype as\nNFTs soared in value.\n\nBoth NFTs and the Metaverse resemble the Swiss Alps. There is a massive run-\nup, followed by a drop-off shortly after, which resembles a Swiss mountain\npeak. It's easy now to see the enormous peak, but how do we spot future fads\nversus technology that can sustain a hype cycle?\n\nNFT run-up trend\n\nWill we see Metaverse projects continue? Sure. In Matthew Ball's book \"The\nMetaverse\", Ball defines the Metaverse as an extensive online realm that\nintegrates virtual and augmented realities, creating interconnected\nexperiences that span various digital platforms. The Metaverse would be a\nconnector between platforms and experiences. So, according to this definition,\nthe Metaverse should live on.\n\nThe Metaverse, which we were sold, is Dead!\n\nWe are not meeting in the Metaverse or wearing big VR headsets all day. They\nare fun for an hour or so, but people will not wear them the entire day to\ninteract with their colleagues. We already have Teams/Zoom fatigue, and now we\nwant to immerse ourselves deeper into this. No way!\n\n> Do I have 3 VR headsets sitting on the shelf? Yup, and I don't plan on\n> buying more anytime soon as I'm disappointed every time.\n\nEven the company that rebranded itself after the Metaverse left the chat and\nturned the focus away from the Metaverse to AI instead. Meta is buying Nvidia\nGPUs by the 1000s and is building some fantastic Open Source LLM tools for AI,\nlike Llama 3. Meta is becoming more of an Open Source company than OpenAI.\n\nNow that AI is the next big thing, I'm not running like a bull into a china\nshop. However, if we zoom out and look at AI over the years, it steadily grows\nand does not have a sharp peak like the Metaverse or NFTs as the trend\ncontinues on months later.\n\nAI compared to Metaverse and NFT's over the last 5 years.\n\nDoes this mean it might die tomorrow? Maybe! But, something I couldn't do with\neither the Metaverse or NFTs was being able to build something of value,\nwhereas, with AI, I have built several useful tools myself, which I continue\nto use.\n\nLike Docker, AI enables developers to build, ship, and run applications more\nquickly. AI also allows the masses to create solutions, answer questions, or\nautomate tasks, enabling them to help build communities and products.\n\nAI has existed since the 1950s, and Alan Turing was already circulating papers\non Artificial Intelligence in 1941. So AI is not new, but AI in its current\nform of GPTs and LLMs has only been around since 2018.\n\nCompanies are hyping AI, misbranding products as AI, and more. We are in a\nhype cycle, but AI has Enterprise software adoption, and governments are\nrushing to regulate, unlike Metaverse and NFTs. Whenever Enterprises and\ngovernments get involved this is a positive signal.\n\nAm I rushing into AI? Yes, because I never learn...\n\n### Follow me\n\nIf you liked this article, Follow Me on Twitter to stay updated!\n\n## How to recover an unresponsive iPhone\n\nLearn to recover an unresponsive iPhone with a step-by-step guide, including\nusing Finder on your Apple device to restore your phone and manage data loss\nrisks effectively.\n\nApr 12, 2024 3 min read\n\n## 5 Game-Changing AI Use Cases for the iGaming Industry\n\nExplore the transformative impact of AI in the iGaming industry, from\npersonalized gaming experiences to AI-assisted game development and compliance\nenhancement.
