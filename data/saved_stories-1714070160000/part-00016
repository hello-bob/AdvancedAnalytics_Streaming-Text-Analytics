She receives just enough money to be counted as \"commercial\". This\nmay be donations from users, it may be tokens for contributing to a\ncryptocurrency project, and it may be the software was developed for\ncommission. She then retires, sells her computer, stops checking her email and\ntends to her garden. The software could be anything, example where critical\ntools are maintained by people who may want or have to stop working sometime\ninclude \"The Internet is Being Protected by Two Guys Named Steve\" who were\nlargely responsible for OpenSSL (used by almost all servers and involved in\nthe Heartbleed bug) and when the sole maintainer of the library core-js (used\nby 75% of the top 100 websites) went to prison for 18 months for lack of the\nmoney to settle. These would seem to fit the EU description of critical\nproducts.\n\nSometime later, but within five years and the expected product lifetime, a bug\nis identified that could count as a vulnerability that requires a security\nupdate. Alice knows nothing about it and does not provide an update or\notherwise handle the issue effectively.\n\nAssuming the EU passes the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) as currently drafted,\nwould Alice's behaviour breach the law?\n\nAs far as jurisdiction is concerned, assume that at least one user is in the\nEU, Alice may or may not be.\n\nThis is mostly based on the Cyber Resilience Act - Factsheet which says among\nother things:\n\nManufacturer\u2019s obligations\n\n  * Once sold, manufacturers must ensure that for the expected product lifetime or for a period of five years (whichever is the shorter), vulnerabilities are handled effectively;\n  * Security updates to be made available for at least five years.\n\n  * european-union\n  * open-source-software\n  * is-x-legal\n  * computer\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this question\n\nFollow this question to receive notifications\n\nedited Nov 1, 2023 at 6:41\n\nPeter Mortensen\n\n19155 bronze badges\n\nasked Oct 30, 2023 at 10:23\n\nUser65535User65535\n\n6,64655 gold badges2424 silver badges5252 bronze badges\n\n14\n\n  * 2\n\nThe law does not say that Alice has to write the fix, merely that she is\nresponsible for the fix being written.

Corporation with serious resources are.\n\nIt's worth noting that these rules are not unusual for anyone trading directly\nwith the market.\n\nIf you lay brick for money, then you are potentially on the hook for a number\nof years afterwards for the quality of your workmanship and so on. You can't\nsimply retire suddenly from your legal obligations.\n\nThese proposals simply begin to bring commercial software development (as\ndistinct from hobby or employed development) into same world that other trades\nand professions operate in.\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nanswered Oct 30, 2023 at 16:08\n\nSteveSteve\n\n2,60588 silver badges1515 bronze badges\n\n18\n\n  * 11\n\nWhat does \"make a few bob as gigging developers\" mean?\n\n\u2013 Azor Ahai -him-\n\nOct 30, 2023 at 23:19\n\n  * 16\n\n@AzorAhai-him- \u201cbob\u201d is another term for a shilling; \u201ca few bob\u201d is roughly\nequivalent to \u201ca few bucks\u201d.

The EU definition of \"economic\noperator\" in the CRA specifically includes natural persons.

If you plan to not retire for 5 years\nthen you will have to either stick to that plan, or else make sure that\nsomeone else maintains the software. Having been paid (including asking for\ndonations) then you are responsible for paying for the software to be\nmaintained.\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nanswered Nov 2, 2023 at 7:20\n\nTom VTom V\n\n29311 silver badge77 bronze badges\n\nAdd a comment |\n\n## You must log in to answer this question.\n\n##\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?
