In fact, HHS\nreached a similar conclusion regarding cannabis\u2019 safety profile in its own\nanalysis.\n\n\u201cLike those latter substances, NORML has long argued that the cannabis plant\nshould be removed from the Controlled Substances Act altogether, thereby\nproviding state governments \u2014 rather than the federal government \u2014 the ability\nto regulate marijuana in the manner they see fit without violating federal\nlaw, and allowing the federal government to provide standards and guidelines\nfor regulated cannabis markets.\u201d\n\nThis is the fifth time that a cannabis rescheduling petition has been decided\nby the DEA. The agency rejected a similar petition in 2016.\n\nThe DEA\u2019s rescheduling decision, once formalized, does not take immediate\neffect. The agency must first accept public comments, during which time\ninterested parties can formally request administrative hearings to further\ndebate the issue. Only following public comments and a possible judicial\nreview will the agency issue its final determination. Changes in marijuana\u2019s\nfederal status will then take effect 30 days following publication of the\nDEA\u2019s final rule in the Federal Register.\n\nThe DEA\u2019s decision notwithstanding, Armentano speculated that federal agencies\nmay ultimately request Congress to create new regulatory pathways for cannabis\nproducts, particularly for those marketed for adult use. The FDA made a\nsimilar request in 2023 with respect to hemp-derived CBD products, which they\ndetermined did not fit within any existing regulatory frameworks.\n\nAdditional information on cannabis rescheduling is available from the\nfollowing NORML op-ed and Fact Sheet.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nHHS Releases Unredacted Letter Confirming Agency\u2019s Recommendation to DEA to\nReclassify Marijuana to Schedule IIIJanuary 12, 2024In \"GOVERNMENT\"\n\nIt Is Time To Deschedule, Not Reschedule, CannabisApril 6, 2016In \"Policy\"\n\nReport: Leaked HHS Letter Calls Upon DEA to Reschedule CannabisAugust 30,\n2023In \"Research\"\n\nPosted in PolicyTagged Biden, DEA, deschedule, FDA, HHS, rescheduling,\nSchedule III\n\n## Subscribe to NORML News\n\n## Subscribe to NORML News\n\n#### The top news in marijuana law reform delivered directly to your inbox:\n\nSponsored by: NORML\n\n## NORML Reports\n\n## Become a Member\n\n## Blog Archives\n\n## NORML STORE\n\n  * Join NORML\n  * About NORML\n  * Privacy Statement\n  * Sponsors\n  * Advertise\n  * Shop\n  * Contact Us\n\n\u00d7\n\n## Contact to Listing Owner\n\n## Discover more from NORML\n\nSubscribe now to keep reading and get access to the full archive.\n\nContinue reading\n\nCopyright 2024 \u00a9 NORML and The NORML Foundation All Rights Reserved 1420 K\nStreet NW \u00b7 Suite 350 \u00b7 Washington, DC 20005 202-483-5500 \u00b7 norml@norml.org\n\nLoading Comments...\n\n%d\n\nNotifications\n\n", "frontpage": true}
