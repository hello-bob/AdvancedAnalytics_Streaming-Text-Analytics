As far as\nI can tell it\u2019s a Photoshop of a cartoon by Dami Lee, the original of which is\nembedded in this article.\n\nBut where this tortured religion metaphor breaks down is that unlike religion,\nwhere we can study the sacred texts to place ourselves on a path to\nenlightenment, the NHS often keeps its divine wisdom locked away.\n\nThat\u2019s right \u2013 what I\u2019m actually writing about this week is how the NHS shares\nits data.\n\nIt\u2019s an important issue because the NHS is bigger than just a healthcare\nsystem. It\u2019s also an incredible population-sized dataset.\n\nThink about what\u2019s hiding within our health records. Because we have so many\npeople and such a heavily centralised health service, the information the NHS\nholds about us, in the hands of scientists, could be key to future medical\nbreakthroughs, like the invention of new drugs, or the discovery of new\ntreatments and better ways to care for people.\n\nIn fact, at risk of getting \u2018spiritual\u2019 about the national religion, I think\nwe almost have a moral duty to open up our NHS data and put it in the hands of\nscientists \u2013 such is the opportunity to make the world a better place by\nstudying it.\n\nBut this is easier said than done, because in many cases the health service is\nactively hostile to sharing information, and there are complicated reasons\nbehind it.\n\nFor example, there's the institutional design of the NHS as a system. There\nisn\u2019t really a singular \u2018NHS\u2019, it\u2019s more a collection of independent services\nwith their own objectives and incentives, so coordination is hard. And then\nthere\u2019s the more practical matter that IT systems in the health service are\noften wildly out of date, or maybe even not \u201cIT\u201d at all, and still paper\nbased2.\n\nPerhaps the biggest reason though is that often we don\u2019t want the NHS to share\nour data.\n\nI think this is understandable. My medical records contain my most sensitive\nand potentially embarrassing personal data, second only to my Deliveroo order\nhistory. I mean, I once had surgery to dislodge a kidney stone, and I\nabsolutely do not want the world to know how they got the laser inside of me\nto zap it3.\n\nThis unease is probably why by 2021, over a million people had opted out of an\nNHS scheme that would have shared health record data for research \u2013 and is why\nthe plans were subsequently scrapped.\n\nBut luckily, it turns out that this wasn\u2019t the end of the NHS\u2019s data sharing\nambitions. In fact, in the years since the opt-out debacle, a much better\nalternative has emerged.\n\nThat\u2019s why this week I\u2019m excited to tell you all about a platform called\nOpenSafely, which does something amazing: It lets research scientists dig into\n58m NHS health records \u2013 while seemingly doing the impossible and completely\npreserving patient privacy in the process.\n\nIt\u2019s the brainchild of Ben Goldacre (yes, that Ben Goldacre, of Bad Science\nfame!) and his team at the Bennett Institute at the University of Oxford. They\nbegan work on it during the pandemic as a means to connect scientists with\nhealth data so that we could learn more about the virus and how to fight it.\n\nAnd given that it was \u2013 and continues to be \u2013 a huge success, I\u2019m surprised we\ndon\u2019t hear people constantly raving about it4.\n\nSo read on, and let\u2019s learn more about how it works!\n\nIf you like nerdy politics, policy, tech, data, and media stories, then you\u2019ll\nprobably like my Substack.

So even if we trust the NHS to handle our records\nsensitively, and even if we trust their systems to remain secure5, we can\u2019t be\nas confident once data falls into the hands of others. And unlike a password\nor credit card number that can be changed, once our health information is out\nthere... it\u2019s out there.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to understand then why data getting loose is real worry. Not just\nbecause of the threat of serious hackers looking for personal information to\nsell on the dark web, but because it\u2019s easy to imagine a spreadsheet\ncontaining sensitive information pinging around between academics as a normal\npart of their work, but ending up accidentally uploaded to the public web or\nemailed to the wrong person, and so on.\n\nThis is why the Bennett Institute has done something really clever: It\u2019s\nturned the normal way of doing things on its head. Instead of our data being\nhanded out, it has instead built a platform that lets scientists carry out\nresearch on health records without any personal data leaving the data-centre\nit is stored in.\n\nIn tech circles, this is known as a \u201cTrusted Research Environment\u201d (TRE) \u2013 a\nsoftware gatekeeper that sits between the data and researchers, and carefully\ncontrols how data is accessed and what data is shared back with the\nscientists6.\n\nThe way it works is that if you\u2019re a research scientist with a hypothesis, you\nwrite some code to interrogate the data and submit it to OpenSafely, which\nwill then run the code on its own system inside the data-centre, and then it\nwill send you the results back.\n\nCrucially, it doesn\u2019t send back specific patients\u2019 information, but only the\nmost high-level, aggregated information that you need to learn about the\nrelationships between treatments and conditions, and so on7.\n\nFor example, to pinch from OpenSafely\u2019s tutorial documents, imagine you wanted\nto study people who were born during this millennium, who had taken a specific\ntype of an asthma medication. You can instruct the system to filter down the\nmillions of medical records to just the cohort of people you want by writing a\nfew lines of code in a modified form of the Python programming language.\n\nSome code that I understand enough to blag my way through a conversation with\na real computer programmer about.\n\nThen you can add some more code to interrogate the data how you wish (eg, what\nhappened if they also took some other medication at the same time?) \u2013 and\ninstruct OpenSafely to spit out the high level results into a file, or display\na graph.\n\nAnd again, it will do all of this without you ever seeing a single individual\npatient\u2019s records.\n\nWhat makes this even smarter is that though the code might look relatively\nsimple to anyone who knows a little Python, OpenSafely\u2019s systems are\nabstracting away a huge amount of complexity under the hood to make these\nsorts of queries even easier for the end users.\n\nFor example, in reality health records are stored in two different formats,\nand legally the data is owned by individual GP practices \u2013 but because\nOpenSafely takes care of mashing up these different databases behind the\nscenes (and because the data never leaves NHS servers8), the scientists doing\nthe research don\u2019t need to worry about any of this9. They just get the results\nthey need.\n\n##\n\nPrivacy and transparency\n\nOpenSafely isn\u2019t the first organisation to create a Trusted Research\nEnvironment like this. It isn\u2019t even the only TRE inside the NHS \u2013 but what I\nthink really makes it remarkable is just how beyond-reproach it is in terms of\nprivacy, to the extent that it seems like everyone is happy with it \u2013 and I do\nmean everyone.\n\nWhat really sold this to me was when I saw a video of Ben Goldacre giving a\ntalk about the platform. He mentioned a group called MedConfidential, who he\naffectionately described as the \u201cmost feral\u201d privacy activists.\n\nIt\u2019s an apt description. The group is led by Phil Booth, a veteran of the\nNO2ID campaign during the Blair years, and it is utterly vociferous in its\ncommitment to protecting patient privacy.\n\nIn fact, over the years as a tech journalist, there\u2019s been a few occasions\nwhen I\u2019ve turned to Phil to get a feisty \u2018sceptical\u2019 quote to balance out\nwhatever wide-eyed and naive privacy nightmare I\u2019m writing about.\n\nSo when Ben explained that MedConfidential had endorsed OpenSafely, my jaw\ndropped.\n\nMore important though is that the reason for their endorsement is not just\nbecause Ben has been shaking the right hands, uttering the right platitudes\nabout privacy, or writing rules that ask people behave when using the\nplatform. What\u2019s make OpenSafely bullet-proof is that it has privacy and\ntransparency baked in by design.\n\nFor example, if you like you can go and check out a real time log of the jobs\nbeing performed by the OpenSafety system.\n\nMichael Gulley has been busy this evening.\n\nEven better, any code that runs on OpenSafely is required to be open source,\nmeaning that anyone can go in and take a look at what scientists are trying to\ndo with the NHS data. And this isn\u2019t just a rule on paper \u2013 the system works\nby integrating with the development platform Github, which makes every line of\ncode publicly visible, whether scientists like it or not10.\n\nAdd this all together then, and what you have is a system that can safely\nrifle through NHS health records without revealing any information linked to\nindividuals, that is fully auditable \u2013 and open for anyone to look at.\nAmazing.\n\n##\n\nGetting Results\n\nYou can probably see why I\u2019m excited by the existence of OpenSafely. As I\nmight have mentioned before, I think that open data is broadly a very good\nthing11.\n\nWhat\u2019s more exciting though is that OpenSafely is already getting results. In\nthe few short years of its existence it has already yielded a tonne of\nscientific papers based on NHS health record data, each incrementally\nimproving our understanding of Covid and how to fight it.\n\nThat\u2019s why it seems obvious to me that we (ie: Britain) should be taking the\nOpenSafely approach and using it to do so much more12.\n\nAnd the good news is that it appears that the ambition is there to do this. In\nNovember last year, NHS England announced a new three year funding deal that\nwill help the team scale up so they can help scientists research the likes of\ncancer, diabetes and asthma. Great!\n\nBut here\u2019s what I find slightly weird. I understand this latest tranche of\nfunding is only worth around \u00a34m per year. In government spending terms,\nthat\u2019s basically nothing. And given the potentially transformative research\nthat could be done, even when you take the other pressures on the public\nfinances into account, shouldn\u2019t we be spending a little more to scale it up\nfaster?\n\nIn fact, I understand that the OpenSafely team has already designed a Trusted\nResearch Environment that is similarly privacy preserving, but is specially\noptimised for AI \u2013 but because of the way government and the health\nbureaucracy works, as things stand there isn\u2019t an obvious mechanism to acquire\nthe funding to actually build it.\n\nBut this seems like a very solvable problem, especially as again, the money is\nbasically chump change.\n\nI mean, given the NHS budget for 2023/24 was \u00a3168.8bn, it means that the\nannual \u00a34m of NHS funding for OpenSafely is equivalent to what the NHS spends\nin about twelve and a half minutes. Or just over ten lengths of Captain Tom\u2019s\ngarden.\n\nGiven the potential world changing benefits of such a system, should we not be\nworking to expand it as much as possible to, well, safely open up Britain\u2019s\ntroves of health data? Could we not give them 15 or even 20 minutes worth of\nmoney?\n\nAnd there\u2019s also a massive opportunity for the government to apply the\nOpenSafely approach even more broadly too. Ben Goldacre has previously spoken\nabout how the same sort of Trusted Research Environment could apply to other\nbits of government, like the Department of Education\u2019s National Pupil\nDatabase. That\u2019s conceptually very similar to NHS data, in that it\u2019s a\nmassive, information-rich dataset, but contains some obviously extremely\nsensitive information.\n\nI guess ultimately then, I think my argument is basically \u201cmore of this\nplease\u201d, and no one sums up the opportunity better than Ben Goldacre himself,\nwho in 2022 wrote:\n\n> \u201cSeventy-three years of complete NHS patient records contain all the noise\n> from millions of lifetimes. Perfect, subtle signals can be coaxed from this\n> data, and those signals go far beyond mere academic curiosity. They\n> represent deeply buried treasure that can help prevent suffering and death\n> around the planet on a biblical scale. It is our collective duty to make\n> this work.\u201d\n\nPreach!\n\nSo perhaps it is time for the government to make a leap of faith \u2013 and scale\nup OpenSafely so we can make the most of the national religion.\n\nIf you like nerdy politics, policy, tech, data, and media stories, then you\u2019ll\nprobably like my Substack.

And some other sources say\n\u201chave now\u201d not just \u201chave\u201d.\n\n2\n\nI\u2019m not joking \u2013 as of last year, \u201chundreds\u201d of hospitals were still\nreportedly using fax machines.\n\n3\n\nLet\u2019s just say this is one part of life where women have it easier than men.\n\n4\n\nBy \u201cpeople\u201d here I mean politicians, scientists, academics, bloggers \u2013 the\nsort of spods who read my Substack basically. I admit that as clever as the\nsystem is, it might be a hard sell to get \u201cdata-driven scientific analysis\u201d on\nthe next series of Gladiators.\n\n5\n\nPerhaps not the safest of bets.\n\n6\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to think of a metaphor for this, and the least glamorous I\ncan come up with is that it\u2019s like buying something from a petrol station in\nthe middle of the night, when you have to stand outside at the little window,\nand have the attendant go and grab you a bag of crisps instead of picking it\noff the shelf yourself.\n\n7\n\nIt reminds me of how TfL uses data from mobile phones to track how we travel \u2013\nbut only gets it in aggregated form from O2, which acts as the gatekeeper.\n\n8\n\nI\u2019m collapsing quite a lot of complexity here that will have health\nprofessionals getting mad. GPs remain the data controller for your health\nrecords, but because this is the modern world, that doesn\u2019t mean they sit on a\ncomputer in your GP\u2019s office. Instead, your records are almost certainly\nstored on systems made by one of three major software vendors who make records\nmanagement systems \u2013 who in turn probably ultimately just store your records\non cloud servers owned by Amazon or Microsoft. But my point is that legally\nyour records are staying within the NHS, and are not being passed about willy-\nnilly.\n\n9\n\nThere\u2019s also a very clever thing it does where it will generate realistic-ish\ndummy data for you to use during the coding phase \u2013 so that once you run it on\nOpenSafely\u2019s TRE to get the real data, you can be confident that you\u2019re going\nto get what you\u2019re expecting.\n\n10\n\nThis also has the added benefit of stopping \u201cP-hacking\u201d, the bad scientific\npractice of manipulating data to appear significant, even when it is actually\nmeaningless, because anyone can check how a piece of research was done.\n\n11\n\nIn fact, after I started researching this piece I later learned that Anna\nPowell-Smith, my PAF-campaigning colleague, actually worked at the Bennett\nInstitute and helped get it up and running in the first place.\n\n12\n\nTo be clear, the OpenSafely approach won\u2019t work for everything in the health\nservice. That\u2019s why the NHS is currently building the conspiracy-theory-laden\nFederated Data Platform with Palantir \u2013 which will be used by hospitals that\nare actually delivering care to people. Because if you want to tell doctors\nwhat to do with specific patients, you can\u2019t really keep that data private\nlike you can from research scientists who don\u2019t care about individuals.\n\n### Subscribe to Odds and Ends of History\n\nBy James O'Malley \u00b7 Hundreds of paid subscribers\n\nWhy that thing you retweeted is probably wrong.\n\n27 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n3 Restacks\n\n27\n\nShare this post\n\n#### How to use NHS data for scientific research \u2013 without creating a privacy\nnightmare\n\ntakes.jamesomalley.co.uk\n\n17\n\nShare\n\n17 Comments\n\nCharles ArthurSocial Warming by Charles ArthurApr 18Liked by James\nO'MalleyAlso, this is Ben Goldacre's second big data project in the NHS (that\nI know of): the first was OpenPrescribing (https://openprescribing.net/),\nwhich gave an overview down to GP level of what was being prescribed\nwhere.Expand full commentLike (1)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nKatie LeeKatie Lee's Top Secret ProjectApr 19James, spare a thought for poor\nSamuel Pepys who, without anaesthesia, had a bladder stone the \u201csize of a\ntennis ball\u201d removed using a scoop inserted into a cut in his perineum (which\nwas never stitched up).
