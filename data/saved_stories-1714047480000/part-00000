The\nother way was to take a plunge into the realm of soft robotics, which usually\nmeans a robot with limited strength and durability.\n\nNow, a team of researchers at Harvard University published a study where they\nused a simple hydraulic gripper with no sensors and no control systems at all.\nAll they needed was silicon oil and lots of tiny rubber balls. In the process,\nthey\u2019ve developed a metafluid with a programmable response to pressure.\n\n## Swimming rubber spheres\n\n\u201cI did my PhD in France on making a spherical shell swim. To make it swim, we\nwere making it collapse. It moved like a [inverted] jellyfish,\u201d says Adel\nDjellouli, a researcher at Bertoldi Group, Harvard University, and the lead\nauthor of the study. \u201cI told my boss, 'hey, what if I put this sphere in a\nsyringe and increase the pressure?' He said it was not an interesting idea and\nthat this wouldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Djellouli claims. But a few years and a\ncouple of rejections later, Djellouli met Benjamin Gorissen, a professor of\nmechanical engineering at the University of Leuven, Belgium, who shared his\ninterests. \u201cI could do the experiments, he could do the simulations, so we\nthought we could propose something together,\u201d Djellouli says. Thus,\nDjellouli\u2019s rubber sphere finally got into the syringe. And results were quite\nunexpected.\n\nThe sphere has a radius of 10 mm, and its 2-mm-thick silicone rubber walls\nsurround a pocket of air. It was placed in a container with 300 ml of water.\nWhen the pressure in the container started to increase, the sphere, at 120\nkPa, started to buckle. Once it started to buckle, pressure remained\nrelatively steady for a while, even though the volume occupied by the fluid\ncontinued dropping. The liquid with a sphere in it did not behave like water\nanymore\u2014it had a pronounced plateau in its pressure/volume curve.\n\u201cMetafluids\u2014liquids with tunable properties that do not exist in nature\u2014were\ntheorized by Federico Capasso and colleagues, who wanted to achieve a liquid\nwith negative refractive index. They started with optics back then, but\nlooking at the behavior of water with this rubber sphere in it, we knew what\nwe had was a metafluid,\u201d says Djellouli.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Mixing programmable fluids\n\nPutting a single rubber sphere in the water was just a starting point. \u201cI\nalways had this idea in the back of my head: Like, what would happen if I put\nin a lot of them?\u201d Djellouli told Ars. So, his team started to experiment with\ndifferent sizes and numbers of the spheres in the medium and using different\nmediums like silicon oil. \u201cYou can tune pressure at which the spheres activate\nby changing their radius and thickness of their walls. When you make the\nspheres thicker, you need more energy to make them buckle and thus the\nactivation pressure will be higher,\u201d explains Djellouli.\n\nThere are other parameters that can be changed to program desired properties\nin the metafluid. These include the volume fraction\u2014basically how much of the\ntotal fluid\u2019s volume is taken by the spheres\u2014and the structure of the spheres,\nas the fluid behaves differently when you put spheres with different sizes and\nthickness in it. You can also tune this by using mixtures of spheres with\ndifferent properties. \u201cIf the variation in size and thickness of the spheres\nis very tight, you are going to have a very flat plateau of pressure when they\nactivate. If you have a wider distribution, the transition from all unbuckled\nto all buckled will be smoother,\u201d says Djellouli. Using different mixtures of\nspheres also enables multiple plateaus at different pressures in one fluid.\n\u201cThis way you can precisely tune the pressure/volume curve,\u201d Djellouli adds.\n\nBy tuning those curves, his team managed to build a smart hydraulic gripper\nthat works without the need for sensors or control systems.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n50\n\nJacek Krywko Jacek Krywko is a freelance science and technology writer who\ncovers space exploration, artificial intelligence research, computer science,\nand all sorts of engineering wizardry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Channel Ars Technica\n\n#### Biomarkers, from diagnosis to treatment\n\nTo find cancer before it strikes, look for the molecular clues\n\n  * ##### Biomarkers, from diagnosis to treatment\n\n  * ##### Scott Manley Reacts To His Top 1000 YouTube Comments\n\n  * ##### Teach the Controversy: Dowsing\n\n  * ##### Teach the Conspiracy: GMOs\n\n  * ##### How Does That Work?: Rising sea levels\n\n  * ##### Teach the Controversy: Flat Earthers\n\n  * ##### How Does That Work?: Radiometric Dating\n\n  * ##### How Does That Work?: The Large Hadron Collider\n\n  * ##### What \"First Man\" tells you about Neil Armstrong, and what it doesn't\n\n  * ##### Delta V: The Burgeoning World of Small Rockets, Paul Allen's Huge Plane, and SpaceX Gets a Crucial Green-light\n\n  * ##### Inside the International Space Station with Scott Kelly\n\n  * ##### Chris Hadfield explains his 'Space Oddity' video\n\n  * ##### Astronaut Scott Kelly teaches orbital mechanics with Kerbal Space Program\n\n  * ##### Go Inside the Aerodrome, Where the Future of Flight Takes Shape\n\n  * ##### The soft future of robotics\n\n  * ##### See the Gear the CDC's Disease Detectives Use in the Field\n\n  * ##### Ars Technica interviews Peggy Whitson\n\n  * ##### The Ice Age Secrets of White Sands National Monument\n\n  * ##### InSight Landing On Mars\n\n  * ##### Talking Space and Robots with NASA's Terry Fong\n\nMore videos\n\n\u2190 Previous story Next story \u2192\n\n### Related Stories\n\n### Today on Ars\n\nCNMN Collection WIRED Media Group \u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
