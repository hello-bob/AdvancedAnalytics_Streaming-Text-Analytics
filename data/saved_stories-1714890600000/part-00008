said.\n  * \u201cObviously, AI has potential for good things too, but ...

Buffett pointed to the technology\u2019s\nability to reproduce realistic and misleading content in an effort to send\nmoney to bad actors.\n\nScammers are known to use AI voice-cloning and deep-fake technology to\nmanipulate videos and images that impersonate an individual\u2019s family and\nfriends to ask for money or personal information.\n\n\u201cObviously, AI has potential for good things too, but ... I do think, as\nsomeone who doesn\u2019t understand a damn thing about it, it has enormous\npotential for good and enormous potential for harm \u2014 and I just don\u2019t know how\nthat plays out,\u201d Buffett added.\n\nWarren Buffett walks the floor ahead of the Berkshire Hathaway Annual\nShareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2024.\n\nDavid A. Grogen | CNBC\n\nAI has been the talk of Wall Street for more than a year, as investors bet on\nthe technology\u2019s potential to drive higher profits going forward. Stocks such\nas Nvidia and Meta Platforms have skyrocketed during the AI boom, up 507% and\n275%, respectively since the end of 2022.\n\nHowever, the investing legend admitted he\u2019s not familiar with AI and likened\nits potential that of the atomic bomb\u2019s during the 20th century.\n\n## More from Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s Annual Meeting\n\n  * Watch Live: 2024 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting\n  * Warren Buffett praises Charlie Munger, talks Apple and AI at annual meeting: Live updates\n  * Warren Buffett says AI scamming will be the next big \u2018growth industry\u2019\n  * Warren Buffett says Berkshire Hathaway is looking at an investment in Canada\n  * Berkshire Hathaway operating earnings soar 39% as Buffett\u2019s cash hoard swells to record $188 billion\n  * Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway cut Apple investment by about 13% in the first quarter\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about about AI. That doesn\u2019t mean I deny its existence\nor importance or anything of the sort,\u201d Buffett said, speaking in a cautious\ntone. \u201cWe let the genie out of the bottle when we developed nuclear weapons\nand that genie has been doing some terrible things lately, and the power of\nthat genie is what scares the hell out of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know any way to get the genie back in the bottle, and AI is somewhat\nsimilar. It\u2019s part of the way out of the bottle, and it\u2019s enormously important\nand it\u2019s going to be done by somebody ... whether it\u2019s going to change the\nfuture of society, we will find out later,\u201d Buffett added.\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
